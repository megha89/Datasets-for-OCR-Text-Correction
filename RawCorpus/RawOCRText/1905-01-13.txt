The "Maetc Mirror" of Japan,
The "magic mirror" of Japan is a
disk of bronze, usually from six to
eight inches in diameter. It is silvered
on the front, which is a little convex^
and there is a raised pattern on the
back, which is rather concave. The
polished pattern Is generally a land
scape, flowers, animals or. Chinese
characters. It Is not visible in the
front of the mirror, but when strong
sunlight is reflected from the front of
the mirror to a wall or screen the pat
tern of the back Is visible on the
screen in bright lines on a black
ground. Professor W. E. Ayrton, F.
It. S., with Professor John' Perry, F-,
R. S., was the first to give the' true
scientific explanation of this magical
effect. It seems that- the design on
the back alters the convexity of the
front, making it flat— ln fact, along
the lines of the pattern. Consequently
the light reflected from the front is
not dispersed at these points of' tt^
design, aud they appear brighter on the
screen.— London Globe.
Fighting the Inevitable.
Nearly all great scientific discover
ies have been combated and misunder
stood even by the intelligent. Even
Sir Charles Napier fiercely opposed the
introduction of steam power Into the
royal navy and one" day exclaimed in
the bouse of commons:
"Mr. Speaker, when we enter her
majesty's naval Rervice and face tho
chances of war we go prepared to be
hacked in pirt-es by cutlasses, to be
riddled with bullets or to be blown to
bits by shot and shell; but, Mr. Speak
er, we do not go prepared to "be boil
ed alive."
The last words he brought out with
tremendous emphasis.': . Steam power in
men-of-war, with boilers which at any
moment might be shattered by an ene
my's shot— this was a prospect hp
could not face. :
Yet In a few years he found him
self in- command, of the largest steam
navy the world had over seen.
A Mathematical Pnzzle.
Here Is a strange little puzzle', whjch
has tbe same. answer, Independent of
the fact that no two people solving tho
puzzle were born the same year and
consequently use the same figures.
Write down the figures of the year you
were boru and from this take away
four. Add your nge at next birthr
day If it comes before January, other
wise your age at your last birthday.
Multiply the result by 1,000 and from
this deduct 055.423. Substitute for the
figures corresponding letters of the at'
phabet, as A for 1, B for 2, etc. Tho
result Is a Chinese table delicacy
which is used In this country for elec
tioneering purposes. Strike out the
first letter and transpose those that re
main to form a word. " ' '"'
Anaemia.
The word anaemia is of modem ori
gin. It was first mentioned by Albert
Michel in 1732 in a thesis entitled "De
Anaemia." However, if the nomencla
ture is new, the morbid condition Indi
cated by the word was at all times
well known. Hippocrates devoted sev
eral pages to a description of this par
ticular condition, but Halle was the
first to apply the term to a malady
which was prevalent in'lßo2 among the
miners of Anzin, in the, north of
France, and of which lie gave n detail
ed description.
A Candid Critic.
Candid Critic— Awfully good song

—Really, do you think so? Awfully
kind of you to— er— but Cnrl Rosa Is

How Smith's Friend Got Through.
They were out in Kansas about 100
miles and wanted to reach Kansas
City. One of them had a pass for
John Smith and wife. He was John
Smith all right, but his friend could
liardly pass as Mrs. Smith. Although
they were practically without funds,
they boarded the train. "Take a seat
■in the rear of the car," said Smith to
his friend. .s-~;,:,,^».
Then Smith went forward 'and sat
down by a young woman. Soon they
were talking like old friends, and the
subject of tickets was brought up by
Smith. He asked her to let him see
her ticket. It was not of the variety
tiiat requires the signature of tbe pur
j^haser.
? Smith examined it until the con
ductor came through, and then he
handed up his Jpass and the ticket.
Pointing to his friend behind.Vhe said,
"The extra ticket is for him." The
scheme worked. To this day the
young woman does not know that she
was once Mrs. Smith for a short ride'
through Kansas.— Kansas City Times.
A Queer Food.
A most singular food Is the larvae
of a fly ' common in certain portions
of California aud known as ephydra.
This insect is found in such vast quan
tities in Lake Mono, Cal., that It Is
washed upon the shores in vast wind
rows and can be collected by bushels.
The water of Mono is very ' singular,
seemingly very heavy and smooth, like
oil, so much so that It resists ordinary
wind and refuses to become ruffled.
When the larvae begin to appear the
Indians gather from far and near and
scrape them up, place the wormllke
creatures on cloths and racks in the
sun and dry them, when they are
beaten up and husked, looking then
like rice. The Indians call the food
koo-chah-bee, and many bushels are
collected at his time. That larvae are
nutritious Is shown by the condition
of the Indians, who soon grow fat on
the rich diet. Many birds are attract
ed by tbe larvae and gorge themselves
with the singular food.
Thackeray's Odd Ways.
"He wrote a very small, neat hand
and used slips of note paper," said the
late John Hollingshead of London con
cerning Thackeray. "These he would
often gather up and put in . his coat
pocket, leaving his secretary at work,
and stroll down to the Athenaeum club.
Here, if he could get a. comfortable ta
ble and was not waylaid by any gos
sip, to whom he was always ready tq
give an attentive ear, he would pull
out his slips and carry his story a feijv
steps farther. In an hour or two he
would again cpllect the scattered par
pers and go on to the Garrlck club,
where, if not interrupted, he wquld re
sume his writing. This habit of com
posing in publip frightened many of
the old club fogies, who thought they
were being caricatured for posterity,
and no doubt helped to get him black
balled at the Travelers'."
The Lnw« of Nature,
$j Tbe universe is under the" reign of
law, which Is everywhere— in things
mean arid minute as well as in things
noble and great. So far as we have
come Into an understanding Qf tbgse,
jaws we have found none defective. : '
No sound philosophy can concede
that a law of nature can be out of bal
ance or in any way less than true and
perfect. When we advance a theory to
the point where it would prove that a
law of nature is out of balance, apd dt»
fective, we should know that the con
clusion is wrong; that It Is our reason
ing, and not the law, that is out of
balance and defective.— From. !'Bal

Her Revenge,

Berwynd's defalcation was only $1,
600, but had he looted the subtreasury
of as many millions Boontown could
not hava been more shocked.
It was uot so much the loss of the
money to the Boontown First National;
that was but an incident. It was the
fact that Chet Berwynd should have
been guilty at all. For generations the
Berwynds had been among the leaders
of Boon town society, and It was re
garded as a matter of course that Chet
should have been made cashier and
paying .teller when the bank was' :
started. '
Some of those who had known Ches
ter Berwynd's father refused at first
to believe the charge, but ill the end
circumstantial evidence proved too
strong to be ignored, and, though Hank
Simmons, the town constable, had a
suspicious moisture In nls eyes, he • led
Chet over to the little village lock
up aud left him In a cell, promising
that a rocking chair and other un
prisonffke conveniences should- be sent
over from his own home as soon as
possible. Hank had never forgotten
how old Dr. Berwynd had worked for
twelve hours over his . little daughter
when she had had the membranous
croup, though he bad just returned
from a long ride into the country. ,
One did not have to go back to Chefs
father for acts of kindness. As boy
and man Chet had always been ready
to give his aid to others, with no
thought Of return, and his incarcera
tion was a shock to the community.
■ Even after the venerable John. Hol
lis had explained that there was a
package of flve $100 bills and two $500
certificates which no one could account
for save Chet, who bad" denied all
knowledge of the money, there were
those who refused to believe that Dr.
Berwynd's son could be ginUty.
Foremost among these was Gertrude
Hollis, who set aside even her father's

opinion to. declare herself openly a par
tisan of Chet, and it was one of the
things that shook her father's faith in
his own judgment. Judge Hollis was a
believer, in woman's intuition. .
It was this which induced him to
hurry the trial in the hope that some
evidence would -turn up whereby the
accused cashier might clear himself,
and there was none more pleased
when, two days before the trial, it was
discovered that rats had stolen the
package and had made a nest of the
crisp paper,. 4--
Gertrude discovered the nest in a
cranny under the cashier's desk. She
communicated her "find" to her father,
who. was also president of {bP bank.
ft ma.de au insignificant little mass,
this expensive nest; but, while the mas
ticated particles were too small to be
redeemed by the treasury department,
it was plain to be seen that the nest
was composed qf bills. The nest was
fluly brought forward at the trial and
was sufficient to acquit.
Chester was the only one dissatisfied
with the acquittal, and that evening he
called at the Hollis home. Gertrude
met him with an apology for her fa
ther, for whom the excitement of the
trial bad been too much.
"It was yqu I came to' see," returned
Chester. "?'I want to ask you a ques
tion."
The red flashed into Gertrude's face.
There bad been no open courtship, but
it had seemed to her that there was
but one question Chester would want
to ask. Her heart beat high, but the
next moment her hopes were dashed.
"Where did you really find that
nest?" he demanded.
"I told you this morning at the trial,"
Bhe declared. *'It was in the little cub
byhole under your desk."

asked curiously.
"I supposed that I had a right to
feel curious," she sold defiantly. "It

of how bills were stolen by rats at va
rious times. I thought I would look
around your desk."
"May I see the nest?" he asked curt:
ously. "They let you kefp it, did they
not?"
She flushed, but she crossed to t

almost shapeless mass, on the outside
of which were tiny particles, barely

curiously. It was all that had stood
between him and prison.

this looks more as though it had beer

* "Do you mean,", he demanded, "thai
you made this?"
j "I couldn't see you go to jail," she
said, tears trembling on her lashes.
.'Did you think I was guilty?" he dfr
manded.
She shook her head. "I couldn't think
:*iat of you,", she said sjmply, "but
things looked so black against, you,
and I remembered stories of mice
building nests— and I— l fixed this up."
' He was so close to her that she could
feel his quick breath on her forehead.
"Did you do this because you were

\ She raised her head bravely.
I "Not because I was sorry."

i Her blushes were her answer. In a
moment his strong arms were about

.'nee upon his 'shoulder. How long
they stood there neither knew. It was
Judge Hollis who Interrupted them.
There were new Hues of care in his
face as he came slowly forward from
the doorway.
"Chester," he said slowly, "God
knows how I have beeu hoping that
some day your union with Gertrude
would give vote the right to call you
'son.' I have looked forward to the
day with no thought of what would
have come before. You are cleared in
our eyes, but while this hangs over
you it is not well that you should

With a cry Gertrude sank upon, the
sofa. Chester bent over and kissed
her, then turned to her father.
''You are right, judge," be said.
"Until this is cleared to our own sat
isfaction It is better so." He turned
slowly to the door, to be jostled vio
lently by Jack Hollis.
"I've run all the. way from the
bank," shouted the lad. "We found

Great Echoes.
The suspension bridge across the
Menai straits, iv Wales, produces one
of the most remarkable echoes in the
world. The sound of a blow with a
harnnier on one of the main piers is re
turned, in succession from each of the
crossbeams which support the road
way, and from the opposite pier at the
distance of 57G feet, in addition to
which the sound is many times re
peated between the water and roadway
at the rate of twenty-eight times in
five seconds.
An equally remarkable echo is that
of the castle of Slmonetta, a noble?
man's seat about twq miles from
Milan.- The report of a pistol Is re
peated by this echo sixty times. A
singular echo is also heard in a grotto
near Castle Comber, iv Ireland. In
the garden of the Tuilerles, in Paris,
Is an artificial echo which repeats a
whole verse without the loss of a sin
gle syllable.
Another wonderful echo is heard out
side the Shipley church, in Sussex,
which echoes some twenty syllables in
the most perfect manner,
The well known echo at Woodstock
repeats itself no fewer than fifty times.

is just closing in. From a business standpoint 'this year, like those
that have preceded it, has proven entirely satisfactory to us.
While there was, comparatively speaking, a general fall off in
business throughout the country and, while almost every merchant
in the state has complained of hard times, notwithstanding these
facts we have done our share; business has been good with us.
For this, thanks are due to our long list of patrons who, liking
the way we .are doing business, have stayed with us.
We, therefore, take this means of ; expressing our sincere thanks
for the many favors they have shown us in the past and assure
them that, should they show us the same courtesy in the future,
they will never regret it. We will endeavor, as we have always
done heretofore, to please all.
Some London Streets.
In some of the older and narrower
streets and alleys of London may be
peen at each end two upright posts. At
first It might be supposed that they
iserved no more useful puipose than
affording material for children to
swing on. But they are used to Indi
cate that the streets which are guard
ed by the posts are closed to wheeled
traffic. Some of the thoroughfares in
the poorer parts of London are so nar
row that a large vehicle would do seri

them, and as they are generally short

poetry into any hymn In the hymn
book." The test is a severe one, for there
are hymns which are wanting both In
sense and poetry. The essayist doubt
less intended to call attention to that
charm of a good voice which enchains

"He&ee everybody was surprised ono

WHY TAXES ARE HIGH.
Of late years the inquiry has re
peatedly been made by property
holders throughout the county: Why
are property taxes so much higher
now than they were twenty years
ago? How comes it that while our
assessment roll has increased over
50 per cent in that space of time, the
tax rate per $100 has a'.oo increased?
While this anomaly may be inex
plicable to the average property
holder, it is not so much a mystery
to one who has watched the drift of
events in local politics. There has
been a steady change in two direc
tions — namely, one toward increas
ting the expenses of government, and
the other toward reducing the very
material sources of revenue, outside
- the direct property tax. We pro
pose in this article to discuss one
phase of the last mentioned proposi
tion. The Ledger has frequently
called attention to the fact that the
fees collected by the sheriff, county
clerk aud recorder have been whit
tled down by legislative processes
extending over many years until
they aggregate to-day a mere pit
tance of what they footed up twenty
years ago. Formerly the receipts
from these offices constituted a very
important item in maintaining the
local government; to-day, however,
they cut a vary sorry figure in the
schedule. To present this question
in a clear light we have taken the
opportunity of segregating from the
official books in the auditor's office
the receipts from fees for the years
1879 and 1880, and comparing the
same with the revenue from the
same offices for the last two years—
1903 and 1904. The result is shown
in the following tables:
1879 : '__lßßo

T0ta1... 14867.84 M 013.80 13580.19 (3208.10
Thus we see that the sheriff's office
paid into the county treasury from
fees for the two years $8881.64, and
the clerk and recorder's offices, at
that time consolidated, $6488.29,
making a total of $15369.93.
Now let us turn to the other side
of the picture, the years 1903 and
1904. For this period the fees col
lected were as follows: ■
1903 Sheriff Clerk Recorder
January 3.00 106.00 243.25
February 5.00 86.25 196.15
March 59.20 120.25
April 8.00 53.75 91.75
May 70.00 107.25

September.... 25.58 48.65 87.75
October 53.05 95.25
November 38.53 90.70 122.00
December 1.50 97.65 122.75
Total 885.08 8985.60 81485.90
For 1904 the
totals are... 57.35 721.75 1383.80
Totals 2 years 8142.43 81707.35 $2869.70
Comparing the two periods we
reach the following result:
1879-80 15369 93
1903-4 4619 48
Loss for latter period 810750 45
From this it will be seen that from
tthis fee question alone the county
has sustained an average loss of
$5325 per year. Confronted with
■ such facts is it a matter of wonder
ment that property taxes have been
on the up-grade. We have to raise
much more money now to keep the
machinery of government going than
we did 20 years ago. Therefore rev-
Jenue shriveled up in one direction
must be more than made up in an
other. The real and personal prop
erty is called upon to make up the
deficiency. And let it be remem
bered that to provide for this short
age alone a tax of 10 cents on every
$100 of assessable property is neces
sary on the basis of the assessment
roll of last year.
It will be asked, What is the mean
ing of this shrinkage? Does it mean
that the business of these offices is
falling off? Not at all. There is
more work done in these latter days
demanding the payment of fees than
was done in by-gone years. But the
disgraceful truth must be told, that
the fee schedules have been ;so
manipulated in the interest of law
yers and political hangers-on that
the revenue has dwindled to the
mere ghost of former years. The
■ history of this crucifixion of our fee
system, and the motives underlying
the cutting-down process, would
forth an interesting, and at the same
time a shameful chapter in Amador
county annals. Property owners are
paying, as the outcome of this vicious
system, the expenses of civil litiga
tion; also the cost of probating es
tates that arc well able to pay for
the official time consumed in their
settlement. * n * nc re-adjustment of
the fee system upou a fair .. and
equitable basis, the legislator has a
grand opportunity to make a record
that would merit aud undoubtedly
command .the lasting gratitude of
a taxpaying community. The op
portunity is presented, but who is
bold enough and straight-forward
enough to press the issue to victory?
Letter From Sacramento.
The democrats are just experiencing
the folly of endorsing- third party
tickets. Two years ago in San Fran
cisco they endorsed Harry Bunkers for
senator in the eighteenth district. He
was elected and votod as a democrat
during his first session, but this year
he announces that he is, and always has
been, a republican, and will vote for a
republican for sonator. He demanded
admission to the republican caucus, and
after a hot fight was admitted, and tho
democratic party now has oxactly tho
same number of members— four— in
both houses.
The senate and assembly both offered
the democrats the same patronage as
the majority, and considered them in
all respects members of the majority.
In the senate the senators declined to
accept anything more than a stenog
rapher each, but the assemblymen
had not at last reports declined to ac
cept tho gifts which were brought
them by the Greeks. The chances are
they will accept, because I see a num
ber of democrats on hand willing to
serve their country for a reasonable
per diem.
There will be no bills introduced until
next week, but there are a number
ready to spring us soon as the word is
given. Among those of general inter
est is the one by Esmudillo, giving
back the Yosemito Valley to the con
trol of the federal government. That
will be bitterly fought, and will attract
much attention. The bills to license
the carrying of guns or rides, and for
bidding the sale of ducks or trout in
the state of California, the measure
being in the interest of tho various gun
clubs of the state. There will be a bill
establishing a' fire marshal, whose
duties it will be to examine into all sus
picious fires in the state, and prosecute
those who are supposed to be guilty of
arson. There will be bills to improve
the malitia, and several bills in the' in
terest of the agricultural department
of the university. The university asks
for a new building for the college, a
dairy and an experimental farm.
Assemblyman Whiting has bills to
create the office of mining inspector,
and to require mine owners to givo
bonds that they will pay their men. "
One of the most important matters
that will come up will be the bills to
provide for banks of deposit all over
tho state for city, county, and state
funds. At present they' have to be
kept in tho vaults of the public treas
urer, but the new law will allow banks
to give certain approved bonds as se
curity, and when they have been de
posited with the treasurer he must de
posit his funds with the banker. That
will add, it is estimated, $50,000,000 to
the money in circulation in this state,
and will add the interest ' at least 2
per cent on that sum to the revenuos
of the state, counties and cities of
California.
Prison reform is attracting a great
deal of attention, and some very radical
legislation is certain to bo put through
this session in that matter. At the last
session of tho legislature tho assembly
created a committee consisting of As
semblymen Prescott (now speaker) Mc-
Konney and Dunbar to study tho prison
question thoroughly and report when
the legislature met" again. The com
mittee collected an immense mass of
information from all parts of the coun
try, and Europe, Asia, and the rest of
tbo world which they carefully ex
amined, and as a result have propared
an elaborate report, accompanied by
numerous bills, to carry out their sug
gestions. They propose that the prison
system of tho state which is now all
chaotic shall be made uniform; that is
to say that each of the reform schools
and state prisons or penitentiaries shall
be utilized for tho care, of a different
class of offenders. Thus Whittier will
be devoted entirely to the needs of a
truant school. It will be a place where
wayward boys just starting ou a crim
inal career can go; where boys who
will not attend school can be sent, and
where petty offenders may be pun
ished. No older boys, young men as is
the case in many instances now, will be
sent to Whittior under this plan, and
no one guilty of serious crime or a
hardened criminal, even though he be
a youth.
lone will be managed on the plan of
the Elmira Reformatory at that town
in New York, which is tho model in
stitution of the kind in tho world.
Boys from 16 to men of 30 will be sent
to lone, when there is reason to believo
that they can be reformed. The worst
cases which now go to Whittier will go
to lone under that system.
To San Quentin will bo sent the
milder criminals, those who are not
desperate, who can easily be controlled,
who are sent up for milder crimes, as
for instance forgery, etc., first offenders,
etc. While to Folsom will go tho des
perate men, the "red shirters" as they
are called in prison parlance.
Under that system if a man is too
bad for one place he will go to the more
advanced stage; if he is better than
the grade where he is he will bo placed
where he can reform. In a word re
form, more than punishment is the key
note of the committee's recommenda
tions. ;: . ■-,
The committee will also present bills
for the enforcement of tho Bertillion
system of measuring criminals, and
will endeavor to have the authorities
in all the jails and prisons in the state
take such measurements and exchange
them with the other prisons, so that as
soon as a man or woman is arrested it
will be possible to know if they have
ever been in a California prison before.
By extending this system to tho whole
country, and indeed to the whole world
as is proposed by ponologists, a crimital
could at once be detected in any part
of the civilized wor.'d that he might bo
arrested.
The committee has also prepared
bills for the creation of the indeter
minate sentence, which means that a
man will be sent to the prison with a
maximum and minimum sentence, and
if he behaves he can get out on the
minimum. This of course only applies
to first offenders.
The committee would abolish the
present system of having counties pay
for the inmates in Whittier and lone,
and would place those institutions on
exactly tho same footing as the state
prisons so far as their support is con
cerned. It is found that not a few
judges sent children and boys to the
state prisons to save their counties this
small monthly payment, thus ruining
the youth and adding another con
firmed criminal to the too large number
infesting our state.
Assemblyman McKenney is tho chair
man of tho committee on prisons and
reformatories, and among other things
proposes to have an evening devoted to
prison matters, to which the governor
and prison officials will be invited, and
when the many questions brought up
may be fully discussed.

who favor, giving tho valley back to
the federal government.
The managers of tho Soldiers Home
at Yountville are trying to arrange to
give that institution to the federal gov

whether the Washington authorities
will want to run two homes in one

If the state gets rid of the valley and
tho home it should be able to save a

The lone and Eastern Railroad Com
pany have been experiencing consider
able trouble with tho locomotive re
ceived from the east some time ago.
It was bought on trial. It is claimed
that on the way from San Francisco to
lone it was run at too high a prossure,
resulting in a collapse at Lodi. It had
to be sent back to San Francisco for
repairs, and was recoived in. lone a
couple of weeks ago ready for business
as It was thought. A trial, however,
soon demonstrated that it was far from
being in working order. After mon
keying with it for over a week trying
to patch it up, tho undertaking was
abandoned by the local tinkers and the
ongino returned to San Francisco for
thorough repair. It will cost $2000 to
put it in working order and there is a
nice chance for tho lawyers to get in
before the matter is adjusted, as the
matter of responsibility is badly mixed
between the original makers, the South
ern Pacific, tho contractors of the new
road, Erickson and Peterson, and the
lone and Eastern Railroad Company.
However, tho large locomotive is on
the way from the east for the use of
tho company, and is expected to reach
lone any day. When this arrives the
track laying will bo resumed, and
pushed ahead as fast as possible. The
graders have got through with their
work as far as Mountain Springs, and

A. J. Cram died at his residence on
tho 4th inst., of chronic Bright's
disease. He was born in Missouri, at
Capo Gerrardeau, on the 2nd of July,
1832. Shortly after his birth his par
ents crossed the Missouri river into
Illinois, whero he remained till early
manhood. In 1853 he carac across the
plains with an emigrant train, driving
an ox team nearly all the way. He had
some exciting experience with the
Indians. One morning just as the grey
misty light of cariy morn shot upwards
from the eastern -firmament, Indians
stampeded their stock, sending them
in every "direction. The consequences
were thoy lost several head of valuatiTo
horses. Mr. Cram and scvoral others
gave chase, and followed for . two days
and nights, but without recovering tho
stock. In making their way back to
tho train thoy failed to find drinking
water, suffering greatly from thirst
thereby. He came direct to Diamond
Springs, working there a short time,
when he came to Amador county, and
did his first work here for S. C.

saw mill situated on the south bank of
the south fork of the Cosumnos river,
and just above its junction with the

erty a couple of years afterwards, and
Mr. Cram was suporceded for a time
by Charles Winegar. In 1869 the ditch
property again changed hands, this
time being bought by Sacramento men,
who placed Charles Green in as super
intendent, and who disposed of Wine
gar and placed Cram back in his old
place. In 1871 Wm. Hooper induced
Alvinza Hayward to take hold of the
Empire mine, then known simply as
the Hooper mine. Tho entire ditch
property was purchased by Hooper and
Hayward, consisting then of the mid
dle and south fork ditches, after which
were added the ditch known as the
Simpson, and running parallel with the
south fork ditch, and one owned at
Indian Diggings by a man of wealth,
and familiarly known as Old Joe Doug
las. Hayward and company placed
Cram in entiro charge of all this prop
erty. He was also contractor for all
wood, coal, timbers, • logs, etc., con
nected with the mine. This ho held
without interruption until they shut
down the great Plymouth Consolidated
mine in '86. After this he had .entire
control of everything in any way be
longing to or operated in Plymouth
and vicinity by the company, which he
hold up to tho time of his recent serious
illness. Mr. Cram hold the office of
constable in 1862 in Shonandoah valley.
When Robert Cosner was elected sheriff
he tended Mr. Cram the doputyship of
Chinese tax-collector, which for reasons
best known to himself ho refused. He
had his faults, as every man indeed has,
but barring this no more charitable
man over breathed tho breath of Hfo.
No needy hand was ever stretched out
to him in vain. No man ever went
hungry from his door, for Jack Cram,
as he was familiarly known, would have
given him bis last cent rather than see
him suffer. He was laid in his last
resting placo by the Odd Fellows, the
funeral being the largest ever seen in
Plymouth. He loaves a wife and eight
living children, together with fourteen
grandcbilden, to mourn a loss that
cannot bo replaced.
Off where the mind in visions have sped,
OS mid the fathomless sea q( the dead,
His soul on its mission is flitting its way,
To the goal of all hope in eternity's bay.

Bard Speaks.
United States Senator Bard is said to
have made a tolling address on the
question of statehood for Arizona and
New Mexico on the floor of the senate,
and has received many complimentary
notices from prominent men and tho
press in general. Just as ho is be
coming a useful member and could per
haps be of great benefit to the state the
legislature has turned him down "and
selocted a new man. California will
never receivo proper recognition until
her man of influence are kept in public
positions long onough to cope with ex
perienced men from other states. This
masterly address and its influence
should mark a fitting close to Mr.
Bard's senatorial career.

in Tennossee, valued at $1000.. The
relatives are D. K. Hall and petitioner,
father and mother of minor, , residing
in Jackson, Mrs. Emma Jewell, grand
mother, iv Pioneer district, . Amador
county, and Honrj and James Toop,
uncles, residing at Defender. A. Cami
netti, attorney.
George M. Huberty, administrator
of the estate of G. A. Douet, vs. Marie
J. Boyrie, Louis Cergneaux, Alice
Cergneaux, and others— The complaint
sets forth that on the 6th day of June,
1902, G. A. Douet and Marie J. Boyrie
and Louis Cergneaux entered into co
partnership, with a capital stock of
$3000; each party. to subscribe $1000.
Tho business was in the conduct of a
saloon at Paloma, Calaveras county.
Marie J. Boyrie was to devote all her
time to said business, and to receive $30
per month and board and lodging, in
addition to her share of the profits of
the business. The land upon which
the business was to be conducted be
longed to Louis Cergneaux and M. J.
Boyrie, and by the terms of the co
partnership they were required to con
vey a one-third interest therein to G.
A. Douet. That the said deceased not
only contributed his share of the
capital, but also the share of Mrs.
Boyrie, and also advanced other money
to her, amounting in all to $4000. That
a building was erected on said lot and
used for hotel and saloon ; that Louis
Corgneaux married defendant Marie
J. Boyrie's daughter, who is now Alice
Corgneaux, and the three conducted
the hotel and saloon as their own prop
erty, to the exclusion of G. A. Douet.;
that said Douot endeavored in his life
timo to got an accounting of said co
partnership, but was unable to do so.
In 1903 sakl, three defendants, without
the consentjof Douet, sold the furniture
and stock of said hotel, ' and appropri
ated the proceeds to their own use, and
also rented the promises for tho sum of
$60 per month, and have converted the
rent to their own ■ use, exclusive of
Douet's interest therein. That since
the death of Douet the defendants re
fuse to account to plaintiff, and threaten
to sell tho property and convert tho
proceeds to their own use. Judgment
is asked for a dissolution of co-partner
ship;, and the appointment of a receiver
to take charge of the property, and
for an account and money judgment
that the court may find due from de
fendants. W. J. McGee and D. B.
Spagnoli, attorneys for defendants.
No More Stomach Tronbles.
All stomach trouble is removed by
the use of Kodol Dyspepsia Cure.".; It
gives the stomach perfect rest by di
gesting what you eat without the stom
ach's aid. The food builds up the body,
the rest restores the stomach to health.
You don't have to diet yourself when
taking Kodol Dyspepsia Cure.. J. D.
Erskine, of Allenville, Mich., says: "I
suffered Heartburn and Stomach trou
ble for some time. My sister-in-law
■has had the same trouble and was not
able to eat for six weeks. She lived
entirely on warm water. After taking
two bottles of Kodol Dyspepsia Cure
she was entirely cured. She now eats
heartily and is iv good health. 1 am
glad to say Kodol gave me instant re
liof." Sold by all druggists.

Flint for Senator.
On the second ballot Frank P, Flint
of Los Angeles, was chosen to succeed
Thos. R. Bard as United States senator
from California. The senator-elect is
a young man of ability, and is not a
stranger to the public, having filled
many important positions in the state.
Southern California justly claimed the
senatorship, and as the political forces
of the republican party seemed to be
against Bard it proved an easy matter
for Flint to win out. Tho young sen
ator is outspoken on important ques
tions, and bids fair to become of great
sorvice to the state.

The Woodmen Install Officers.
Certainly Jackson Camp, No. 688,
W. O. W., are to be congratulated
upon the success attending- their first
open installation of officers, for it seldom
falls to the lot of visitors to be so hichly
entertained as were tho»o who were
fortunate enough to bo present at Odd
Fellows hall Monday evening and listen
to the solemn and impressive installa
tion ceremony, the excellent program
rendered, the presentation of the stump
and silken flag, and lastly, but not by
any means the least, to be permitted to
sit at tho banquet table that had been
prepared by. the wives, daughters, and
sweethearts of these strong men of the
forest.
Promptly at 9 o'clock Consul Com
mander H. C. Shear arose and called
the meeting to order, and delivered an
address of welcome that made all
present feol that they were indeed wel
come. Rev. Winning then stepped
forward, and in behalf of Past Consul
Commander B. F. Horr and son pre
sented the camp with a beautiful red
wood stump that had been brought
from Santa Cruz county for the oc
casion. Commander Shear received
the gift, and in well chosen words
thanked the donors for their beautiful
souvenir emblematic -of the order.
Rev. Winning then called Clerk J. F.
Wilson to the floor, and on behalf of
the camp presented to him a beautiful
gold pen and case. Clerk Wilson was
taken by surprise, but being as ready
with tongue as with pen gracefully
acknowledged the gift and pledged
himself to renewed energy during his
incoming term as clerk.
Past Consul Commander Horr then
called upon the grand officers to take
their respective stations, commanded
the marshal to bring forward the in
coming officers, and in sentorian tones
delivered to each the solemn obligation
of office. The following officers were
installed:
Consul Commander — EL C Shear.
Advisor Lieutenant — G. O. Keffer.
Banker— C. G. Heiser.
Clerk— Dr. J. F. Wilson.
Physician— Dr. L. E. Phillips.
!2scort— Robt. W. Scott.
Watchman — Wm. Tucker.
Sentry— H. M. Horr.
Managers — T. A. Marsino and Geo.
M. Huberty.
After rendering the evening's pro
gram a youth from the forest stepped
forth and placed in the hands of Neigh
bor Winning a beautiful silken flag and
addressed it in wprds, that thrilled his
hearers. This emblem was tha sur
prise of the evening to the members,
for it had been secretly procured by
their lady friends and not until the
youth and Neighbor Winning had
spoken the last words of their beautiful
tributes to the Gag did tba inemberg
realize that it was a gift to the camp.
Calling the members to their feet Rev.
Winning, speaking for the ladies, pre
sented thestarry banner to Commander
Shear, who accepted it in a worthy
manner and thanked the ladies for
their generqus offering.
After a flashlight by Neighbor Mc-
Millan the guests and members, to the
number of 150, filed into the spacious
banquet room, where was -spread one
of the most inviting feasts that it has
been pur privilege tp partake pf iq
many year?'. The committee in charge,
Mrs. B. F. Horr, Mrs. Geo. McMillan
and Mrs. O. Keffer, and all others who
assisted deserve the everlasting grati
tude of all camp m.embers. Their
efforts were fully appreciated b,y all
present. The tables were bountifully
filled after all had feasted. No matter
what mistakes the Jsckson Woodmen
may have made they have certainly
selected for wives and sweethearts ladies
who can provide a banquet fit for kings.
The stump cake was a new feature, and
was as good as it looked to be. Ex
cellent music was furnished during the
evening by Prof. Pell's orchestra.

Wedding Bells.
J. R. Avlse, a native son of Jackson,
and Miss Cynthia E. Ruffner, one of
our most popular native daughters,
wore united in marriage on Tuesday,
Jan. 10, 1905, by the Rev. C. E. Winning
of the M. E. church. The ceremony
took place at tho hpme pf the bride's
parents, near Butte mountain. Harvey
Pense acted as best man, while Miss
Margarette Aviso made a most charm
ing bridesmaid. An excellent dinner
was served immediately after tb,e min
ister pronounced then} man and wife.
Only the vory intimate friends and rel
atives of the contracting parties were
present. Many valuable presents were
received by the bride. The young cou
ple will continue to reside in Amador
county,
The Ledger force joins in wishing
them continued health, happiness, and
prosperity.
They Praise Roosevelt.
W, J. Bryan, in a recent speech be
fore a Jackson democratic club, said
many complimentary things about the
ability and fearlessness of the president
in his efforts to serve the people, re
gardless of the great money powers of
the country. Mr. Hearst also has dis
covered that the president is honest
and capable, and believes that with the
aid of the democratic members of con
gress he will be able to accomplish
much good for the American people.
The president by early declining a re
nomination, will be estimated at his
true value by all classes, and we can
look for nothing but peace, harmony,
and prosperity during his coming term.

Bailroad Gossip.
The lone and Eastern railroad from
lone to Jackson and Sutter Creek is
slowly but surely being completed, and
those who remained skeptical to the
last moment have fallen into lino with
the spirit of progress, and aro now
guessing and woudering whore and
when the building of railroads, which
is suro to bring prosperity to the
county, will end. Much talk is being
indulged in at present about a new
company that has been organized for
the purpose of building a road from
the Amador County Lumber Com
pany's grounds on Sutter hill through
to the extreme eastern portion of the
county. At the same time one of the
directors of tho lone and Eastern road
declares that their road will be built as
far as Volcano within a year, and that
the surveyors are already looking over
the route for that purpose. The natural
resources of the eastern portion of the
county are varied and valuable, and
are worth fighting for. The only won
der is that the contest has been delayed
so long. Amador oounty was intended by
nature to be the home of an industrious
and enterprising^people. . Her rich de
posits of quartz, immense fields of soap
stone, wonderful beds of granite, large
areas of timber lands and numerous
fertile valleys, all combine to make her
one of the favored spots of earth. No
one railroad can strip her of her natural
resources within the next century. As
the earth is, sshprn pf its natural
growths the soil is of such a character
that it can be transplanted with the
artificial and made to yield abundantly.
Our apples, pears, peache , grapes, and
other fruits, are pf the be§t. And with
the railroad are sure to comethesturdy
men and women, who will take advan
tage of every opportunity offered. Let
the good work go on, and if the con
tending forces cannot settlo their dif
ferences let us have twp roads ipstead
of pne. • Npt one of those now inter
ested in either enterprise would live to
see their work a failure. But this is
not all. There is strong, talk of an
electric road from Sacramento into
Plymouth and on through tho fertile
Shenandoah' va,||ey. These roads are
being built in many places, and we
know of no better strip of country in
the state without railroad facilities
than this proposed route. It would be
a paying proposition and it is suro to
come. Amador county has stood in
the background for many years. The
mother lode belt has been recognized
for its mineral output, but the re
maindor of the county has been com
paratively an unknown quantity. She
is sopn tp feel the wave of prosperity
and rise tp her proper level. God
speed the day when these contemplated
enterprises shall become realities, and
we shall become known and appreci
ated throughout the stato and nation
in a manner befitting our station.

High School-
A few years ago vye were permitted
tp sepd our children to the district
schools and have them taught in alj
the branches tha.t wero necessary to
prooure a grammar grade certificate.
Many of our children availed them
selves of the opportunity, and observa
tion has taught us that our home-made
teachers are second to none. But con
ditions have changed very much of late.
Under the present school law many of
our children are debarred from the dis
trict school at the age of 13 or 14 years,
and all of them when they have mas
tered the low grade studies, which
barely qualifies them for the most
common avocation of life. The rich
man may send his child to the high
school; the poor man cannot. In
course of time tho rich man's children
will occupy all of the eminent positions
in life, irrespective of their mental
qualifications. You are aware that
education does not give mind, but en
ables tho boy or girl to bring out the
mind that is within them with strength
and polish. Now, in order that our
children shall all have equal rights
they should have, as near as possible,
equal educational opportunities. This
we can greatly facilitate by establishing
high schools in each high school dis
trict as the law has provided. There
are many reasons why wo should have
a high school at the door of our gram
mar schools wherever convenient.
First, It will be an incentive to tho
pupils in the grammar grades to study
more diligently, that they may enter
the high school young in years. To
the greater portion of our scholars it
will stimulate them to higher ambitions
in life. These schools can bo so located
that they will be accessible to nearly
every scholar In the high school dis
trict, and they will not augment the
tax but very little. By all means let
us educate our children.

MINING NEWS
Argonaut.— lt sounds well to the
passer-by to hear the mill on this mine
pounding- away on ore that is suro to
yield liberally of the precious metal.
It was no lack of ore or confidence in
the merits of the mine that caused it
to shut down about two years ago. A
law suit then pending between the Ken
nedy and Argonaut as to the exact
boundary line, etc.. was the primary
cause. After a decision favorable to
the mine was given, the labor troubles
were taken into consideration by the
promoters and the time for resuming
operations were somewhat delayed.
We now expect to hear of the Argonaut
taking its place again with the fore
most of the dividend producers.
South Eureka— ln our article of
last week we stated that the old mill
would be shut down soon alter the new
mill was started up. We have since
been informed that this is a mistake,
and that both mills will be kept run
ning. We are pleased to correct the
error, for the more, extensive milling
capacity the greater will be the output
from tho mine. The South Eureka is
certainly forging ahead.
Treadwell.— This property after
being closed down for four months, and
all differences between employers and
employes satisfactorily adjusted, has
been started up again by the owners
with renewed vigor. A new superin
tendent has been employed, and de
velopment work will be carried for
ward on quite an extensive scale. All
who have worked on this property
speak flatteringly of its merits.
Climax — Superintendent Aitken
says the prospects of this mine are very
encouraging. The ore shoot has been
worked for a distance of 600 feet—prob
ably the longest continuous ore body
met with on the eastern tier of mines.
Considerable coarse gold is obtained
from the batteries at every clean-up.
The amalgam has surrendered from $6
to $8 per ounce. Even with a two
stamp mill the mine has been able to
pay its way, and leave a surplus for
betterments. It is contemplated to en
large the milling capacity to at least
10 stamps when the ledge in the lower
level now being, opened is fairly de
veloped.
Central Eureka.— The Central
Eureka increased her. regular 5 cent
dividend again in December, and the
directors have declared a t cents per
share dividend, or $28,000 in all. The
stockholders of the Central are fortun
ate people. They not only have a good
property but the management is of the.
best, and the output of the min,e over
and above actual running expenses is
distributed among them regularly each
month.

Bought a Gold Brick.
A hobo of the gold brick type visited
Amador City recently and sold to one
of the business men there a fancy nug
get for 50 cents. "The seller at first re
fused to part with his treasure, but the
shoe-maker was persistent and finally
succeeded in inducing the stranger to
sell. After delivering the precions
metal and getting at a reasonable dis
tance he informed his dupe that it was
only brass. As no crime had been
committed the purchaser could only
grin and bear it, while those who wit
nessed the transaction had a good
laugh at his expense. Later the hobo
went to Drytown and disturbed the
peace and quiet of that enterprising
little town, and deputy sheriff Dave
Gray secured a warrant, followed him
to Sacramento, brought him back and
landed him safely in the county jail.
He will probably get a few days' free
board, and the deputy will got— his fees.

there is nothing better than De Witt's

Moore, of LaFayette, Ind., says: "No

Risers do their work. All other pills I

THE AMADORLEPqEK: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, - FRIDAY. JANUARY 13, 1905.
Doninthorne's
Model
A. M. DAVIES OGDEN
Copi/ritfW, 190k, by A. 31. Davks Ogtlcn
It was varnishing day, and Piccadil
ly was crowded with the throngs pour
ing into Burlington House. All smart
London was there. Gay chat, bright
costumes, the latest gossip, everything
rather than the pictures, held the atten
tion of those present. So at least it
seemed to a slender girl with a clear
cut, attractive face who strolled slow
ly from picture to picture, lingering to
study one here and there, promising
herself to come again' when there were
fewer people.
Then suddenly a little cry escaped
her parted lips. Was it possible? She
was back in Llandudno again. There
was the Irish sea dancing in the sun
light, the green curve of the Great
Ornie, and surely— surely that figure In
white, gazing with shaded eyes out
across the water, was herself. Bend
ing closer, she gazed eagerly at the
picture. Yes, the face was hers. To a
casual " passerby perhaps the likeness
might not be striking, but to her— the
pose, the dress — everything spoke elo
quently. How could it have happened?
Hurriedly consulting her catalogue, she
found the picture. "Hope" it was call-
SHE STAKED AT THE PICTUBE.
Ed, and the artist's name Italph Law
rence Doninthorne. She knew no one
of that name.
Slipping into a seat near by, she
stared at the picture. Was she really
like that? A voice from behind caught
her attention.
"It certainly was a great piece of
luck to have it accepted. No, I don't
know the model's name! I saw her
last summer and painted the picture
largely from memory. I could never
find out who she was and never dared
speak. I think I would be bolder now.
And somehow I have the feeling that
she lives in London."
His friend laughed.
"You expect to meet her in the street,
then? And what would you do— just
go up and ask her to dine?"
"Perhaps," retorted the artist seri
ously. The girl, half rising from her
seat, hastily pulled off her gloves and
drew a ring from her finger, then,*aft
er a moment's hesitation, replaced it
and turned. The artist was standing
alone, his friend having strolled to an
other part of the room. She lifted'tran
quil eyes.'
"I will accept your kind invitation to
dinner with pleasure," she said dis
tinctly. The" man, his face flushing,
sprang forward.
"You?" he stammered. "You?"
"But we will have to go at once, for
I must not be out late," she went on
calmly. With an effort the man pulled
himself together. <
"I am indeed honored," he said, with
a bend of his head.
As In a dream he led the way from
the building, the girl talking uncon
cernedly as though it were the most
natural thing in the world, and it was
not until they were seated at a little
table overlooking the busy Strand that
he dared draw a long breath. Would
she vanish away? The girl leaned back
and looked at him.
"And will you please tell me why
you did it," she asked— "why you
painted my picture in the first place
and why you exhibited It in the sec-
Hls face clouded.
"I hope you are not vexed. But I
could not help painting it. To me last
summer you seemed the very spirit and
incarnation of youth and joyousness.
And then, in fear and trembling, I sent
it In, hoping, fearing, longing, that
through It and somehow I might find
a clew, a trace. Judge, then, of my
Joy when it was accepted. And was I
not right?" he cried triumphantly.
"Are we not here— together?"
The girl was again slowly pulling off
her gloves; his eyes, following her
movements, fell upon her left third fin
ger, with its single diamond. The girl
nodded.
"Yes," she said, "it's an engagement
ring, but because I was interested in
$he picture I came. It is not likely
that wo shall ever meet again, so for
tonight Jet us be friends. Tell me all
about yourself, your ambitions, your
plans/ watching him with bright,
sympathetic eyes. "I will be glad to
listen."
Doninthorno sighed.
"There is not much to tell. I have
worked and studied and succeeded a
bit, as you see, and now I have man
aged to get to London. Since the fin
ishing of the portrait I have been toil-
Ing over studies for the competition
under Sir Anthony Frewell. This
morning I was most keen about it;
ftow''— his gaze again resting upon her
ring. The girl's eyes widened.
*T3h- Anthony Freweil! You mean
the" .president 6f the academy?"
'•Yes. lam asked to a big reception

there tomorrow night, but I doubt If I
go. lam not much in the society line.
Now I have told you all. Will you nol
in return gl^e me some knowledge' oi
yourself?" he begged. The girl hesi
tated. ■:,•,■_
"I— l am a very unimportant person.
I am sort of a companion— yes, com
panion—to an elderly gentleman, and—
and I do not know when I shall be
married," glancing at the ring. "It 1c
because the gentleman is dining oui
that I am free tonight So do let us
enjoy it. Ah, here comes our dinner.
You will have soup?"
The long English twilight was still
lingering when the two issued from
the restaurant. The artist, at her re
quest for a hansom, drew his breath
sharply.
"And am I really never to see you
again?" he demanded. The girl lifted
uncertain eyes.
"Is it not best?" she asked. And aft
er a moment he answered to their mutt
appeal. :
"You are right. It is best," he said
steadily. The girl's face cleared.
"And— and you will go on and work
make yourself famous," she insisted.
"Attend Sir Anthony Frewell's recep
tion tomorrow .night."
"If you wish it. And now goodb'y.
Give the man your own address. I will
not listen. And if ever I do accom
plish anything remember that it is
first of all due to you. Goodby."
As Doninthorne next evening entered
Sir Anthony Frewell's house the blaze
of lights and sounds of music fairly
dazzled him. At the announcement of
his name the "R. A." shook him warm
ly by the hand.
"I am glad to meet you," exclaimed
the great man cordially. "Your work
shows remarkable promise, and I think
it likely— yes, very likely— that yours
may be the prize deslgu in our competi
tion. My little daughter tells me that
she has already met you," he contin
ued. "She is not 'out' yet, but begged
so hard to be allowed down tonight
that I finally consented. You know,
these motherless girls usually have
their own way," with a smile.
But the artist hardly heard. : He was
watching a girl, the back of yjhose
head looked oddly familiar. As if con
scious of his gaze, she turned, then
came slowly forward. Sir Anthony
patted her hand.
"This is my madcap, and she does
not deserve to be here after the
naughty way in which she ran off from
poor Miss Finch yesterday."
The girl, her mouth curling mischiev
ously, glanced up at the artist.
"I certainly played truant," she ad
mitted. "Come, Mr." Doninthorne, can
I not present you to some of these
pretty girls?" s . 'y "
Doninthorne, doggedly persistent,
drew her into the conservatory.
"Why— why did you do it?" he de
manded. Miss Frewell laughed.
"Because I pleased and because— l
knew you all the time and— and want
ed to see if I would like you."
"And you decided" — coming danger
ously close. The girl's breath quick
ened.
"I— l haven't decided yet," she re
sponded lamely. Douinthorne, touch
ing the now rlngless hand only half
concealed by its lace mitt, gazed in
quiringly.
"And this?"
She had the grace to flush.
"That was my chaperon. It is an en
gagement ring, my mother's, which I
always wear, though not always on
that hand."
Doninthorne's clasp tightened.
"Ah, and when you^ have decided
about me, when the success that seems
about to be achieved shall have defi
nitely crowned'my work, may I, dare I,
hope that you will wear another ring
mine?" He was holding both hands
now ini rebuked and ben| Tower to catch
her answer. "May I 'put one on the
proper finger, dear?" The girl, her
lashes fluttering, dropped her head.
"Perhaps some day," she whispered.
Dining With John Adams.
In the 3'ear 1818 Henry Bradshaw
Fearson, an' Englishman, dined with
John Adams, second president of the
United States, at the Boston home of
the fine old statesman, then eighty
four years old. The Sunday dinner
was as follows: First course, a pud
ding made of Indian corn, molasses
and butter; second, veal, bacon, neck
of mutton, potatoes, cabbages, carrots
and Indian beans; madeira wine, of
which each drank two glasses. "We
sat down to dinner at 1 o'clock. At 2
nearly all went a second time to church.
For tea we had pound cake, sweet
bread and butter and bread made of
Indian corn and rye. Tea was brought
from the kitchen and handed round by
a neat white servant girl." Fearson
says further, "The establishment of
this political patriarch consists of a
house two stories high, containing, I
believe, eight rooms, of two men and
three maid servants, three horses and
a plain carriage."
An Ancient Irish Custom.
In the district known as "the barony
of Forth," in County Wexford, Ireland,
is to be found a race of hardworking,
industrious peasants, living in thatch
ed cottages with clean, whitewashed
walls, which by their perfect whiteness
at once arrest the attention of the vis
itor. These people differ in many re
spects from the inhabitants of the
other parts of the same county and
have habits and customs peculiar to
themselves. When a funeral takes
place two wooden crosses are provid
ed. On the way to the cemetery a
halt is made at a certain spot by the
side of the road. Here prayers are
said for the deceased, after which one
cross is deposited in a hawthorn bush
or under It The procession then goes
on its way, and after the interment
the other cross is fixed at the head of
the grave. This strange custom dates
rrotn time Immemorial, as the great
pile of crosses by the roadside indi
cates.

WiinhlnKton.
"My father," said Wellington's son,
"deemed Washington the purest and
noblest character of modern time — pos
sibly of all time— and, considering the
raw troops with which he had to op
pose the trained and veteran soldiers
of England, also a great general."
Another interesting statement which
the second duke made to General Wil
son, who writes to the Cornhill, was
that when his father. was assigned to
the command of an expedition to be
Bent out against the city of Washing
ton and New Orleans in 1814 he de
clined the command chiefly on the
ground that he would not fight against
Washington's countrymen. And when
his government asked for the names
of three officers from whom a com
mander could be selected Wellington
wrote, "Sir Edward Pakenham, Sir
Edward Pakenham, Sir Edward Pak
enham," and so poor Sir Edward, his
brother-in-law, was sent to New Or
leans to meet his death in the moat
disastrous defeat ever sustained by a
British army.— St James' Gazette.
Roman Gormanda.
The wealthy gormands of Rome cher
ished a strong partiality for song birds.
Both Horace and Martial refer with
approval to roast thrush, and Ovid
recommends "a crown of thrushes" as
a lover's present to his mistress.
Thrushes' breasts were one of the in
gredients of the celebrated Aplclan
dish, "Patina aplciana," which also in
cluded beccaflcos, mushrooms, sow's
udder, fish and chickens, rivaling the
heterogeneous contents of a gypsy's
"pot au feu."
Horace relates that the sons of Ac
tius, to stimulate their appetite for
dinner, lunched on "nightingales of
monstrous price," and Varro tells us
of the aviary of Lucullns, which was
also a "salle a manger," so that the
epicure gratified his ears and his palate
simultaneously, feasting upon the deli
cate warblers whose congeners, uncon
scious of their coming doom, were dis
coursing meanwhile the most exquisite
music.
Fen Down ana Feathers.
Adulteration laws were quite as nec
essary in the good old days as In the
sophisticated twentieth century. Even
the adulteration of feather beds and
bolsters had to be provided against
Oct. 14, 1495, is the date of a statute
prohibiting the sale In English fairs
or markets. of these articles or of pil
lows, "except they be stuffed with one
manner of feathers." It expressly de
nounced the use of such "unlawful and
corrupt stuffs" as "scalded feathers, or
fen down." The last substance is the
same as cotton grass and was evident
ly in great demand as a substitute In
bed stuffing. In the eighteenth cen
tury again there were complaints
against people who bought fen down
at a halfpenny a pound and sold It
among feathers at sixpence.
Franklin and Klnga.
In the writings of Thomas Jefferson
are some interesting anecdotes of Ben
jamin Franklin. He says: "When Dr.
Franklin went to France on his Revolu
tionary mission his eminence as a phi
losopher, his venerable appearance and
the cause on which he was sent ren
dered him extremely popular. All ranks
and conditions of men entered warmly
into the American Interest. *He was,
therefore, feasted and invited to all
court parties. At these he sometimes
met the old Duchess of Bourbon, who,
being a chess player of about his force,
very generally played with him. Hap
pening once to put her king into prize,
the doctor took it. "Ah," said she, "we
do not take kings so." "We do in
America," said the doctor.
Hum Batter Ilnnt.
In certain districts in England a mix
ture of butter, sugar, spices and rum,
called "rum butter," Is made when a
child is born. A special bowl of the
delicacy is hidden In some out of the
way place In the house. Then a num
ber of young fellows of the neighbor
hood search for it. Sometimes they
succeed in locating it and at other
times they fall. After eating the rum
butter a collection is made among
those present, and the money contrib
uted is placed in the bowl for the new
born child and returned along with
the bowl to the house where it waß
procured. — London Spectator.
Harried to a Dead Tiger.
A curious custom obtains among the
Coorgs. When one of them kills a
tiger or a panther, he is married to the
dead animal, regardless of its sex.
Propped upon a framework of wood
or bamboo, the animal is carried in
procession, and the marriage ritual
is strictly observed, while lavish hos
pitality is dispensed.— Calcutta States

asked for freshly laid eggs.
Time's Cnnnarea.
"It used to please me," said Olden,
'to have the barber ask me if I want

"Yes?"
"Yes, and now he sometimes flatters
