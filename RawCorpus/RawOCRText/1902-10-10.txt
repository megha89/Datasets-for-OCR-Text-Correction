CATCHING A THIEF.
An Old Method Utilised by a German
Officer In China.
Thirty dollars was stolen at the Of
ficers' club in Tientsin, China,' and the
wesibera of the dub resolved, if possi
ble, to catch the thief. :- '■; vb.'Z '~"C
- ; A'- German . captain volunteered to
manage the affair, and the first thing
he did was to summon all the native
servants of the club. He then said to
them:
"Some' money has been stolen here,
and lam looking for the thief. I shall
Ind him in an hour, not before, since
I seed that much time in order to get
instructions from a celebrated magi
cian In Germany."  . \
~ An hour later, all the servants were
again summoned, but this time into a
dark room, In the middle of which
stood the table on which the, moneys
Stolen had been laid.
"Each of you, now," said the officer,'
"must go up to that table and press on
It first your right and then your left
hand, and when that is done yon must
•raise your two hands over your head^
and step Into the next room."
The servants did so, and as tbe last
one stepped into the adjoining room
the officer followed , him, and after
looking for a few moments at the many
uplifted hands he pointed to one man
and said, "You are the thief." The
Chinaman to whom he pointed nearly
fell to the ground with fright and ad
mitted his guilt and promised to make
restitution.
Very simple was the method adopted
by the officer for discovering the cul
prit. While the .native servants sup
posed that his spirit was in Germany
in communion with the celebrated ma
gician he was carefully smearing the
surface of the table In the dark room
with fat and oil, which he then black
ened by means of soot. The innocent
servants naturally pressed their hands
on the table, according to his lnstruc-'
tlons. but the culprit, though super-
Btitio..s. did not do so.
As a result, while the uplifted hands
of all the others were coal black, his
were of a natural color, and thus his
guilt W3S clearly proved.— Detroit Free
Press. " -
KILLED THE SPIDER.
Deadly Influence of a Small Magnet.
JJJf the Insect,
An experiment made by a scientist
to tost the influence which a magnet
will have on a sp.der is of interest
The magnet employed " was a small
steel one of the U shape, the legs of
which were about two and a half
Inches long by one-half inch wide and
one-sixth of an inch thick, the distance
between the poles . being about one
fluarter of an inch.
Having noticed a small spider active
ly running along his armchair, ..he
brushed it' off upon the carpet, where
it began to rnn, but was somewhat im-;
peded by the roughness of the fabric,
lie now slid the magnet along the car
pet, following after the spider, till the
ends of the poles were vvitliiu a ,quar
ter of an inch of it. The animal, .'with
out being touched, almost instantly
stopped, and on withdrawing: the mag
net the spider continued on his jour-,
ney.
The experimenter then placed the
magnet within half an inch in front of
the spider, and, withdrawing it slow
ly, the latter followed- it in every direc-.
Won which the magnet took, both in
»UralgHt and circuitous routes.
Gradually, however, tne spider be
came so strongly magnetized as to be
immovable for several minutes, the
magnetic influence seeming to lose its
further power. On withdrawing the
inugnej: altogether. the ppWer began |q;
recover somewtiat. "" " j
The scientist ultimately placed a
tumbler over the spider and the' mag-:
net, covering them both completely,!
and at the expiration of several min-'
utes the spider, after a struggle to es-;
cape from the strong 'influence which
the magnet, exercised over" it, was!
dead.— Exchange.
The Word Flattery.
At first sight there would appear to'
be little connection between flattery;
and the wagging of a dog's tall. TPti
In nearly all the northern language the
same word signifies both, and flattery, 1
Is certainly derived from the word slg-,
nifying to wag the tall. In the old'
Norman flagra signifies to flatter and:
also to wag tbe tail. In Danish logre
la to wag the tail, and loger for een is'
to fawn on one. In. Dutch yleyden Is
to flatter and vleydsteerfen is"to"wag:
the tall. In the old German wedeln .
is to wag the tall, and In English
wheedle is to gain one's end in -flat
tery. ;? i\ 1■« ittitii > : ■
nothing' Wasted, j
A Scottish farmer when going to
market It was observed,' always took
a hen with him in his trap. The reason
was never known until one day he took
a friend with him on a drive. Every
place the farmer stopped lie put the
nosebag on his horse, and then the hen
was so trained that what dropped f r.om
the horse's bag the hen would pick up,
10 there was nothing wasted.—Pear

Following the English style, dinner
Is a full dress and ceremonious affair.'
After dinner comes the promenade
along the esplanade, "a charming walk
around the old battery overlooking the
prison, says the Catholic World. - Our
way borders ' the behind us lies
the city,' with "its Moorish towers, its
red tiled roofed-back of It rises Mount
Ancon; to our left is the little Indian
hamlet of La Boca, at the mouth of
the Rio Grande, and the green hills of
the Andes in the distance; along the
horizon oceanward ■ stretches the bay.
What words can describe it? A' study
In color as the rays of the setting sun
turn to crimson, green and gold its
islands; the stately palmetto trees that
fringe the white beach and
far, away the "ancient towers", of San"
Anastaslus,' sole landmark of the once
beautiful city of old Panama.
The story of. this beautiful city, old
Panama, "reads like one of the ro
mances from the "Arabian Nights" that
so delighted our childhood. Its houses
of aromatic wood, hung* with costly
tapestries, adorned with paintings and
sculptures that a king might envy;
its 800 magnificent churches, with their
services of sliver and gold, their fres
coes of pearls and precious stones; its
pleasure gardens'; its broad driveways,
chief of .which" was the king's high
way, over which the royal horses bore
the treasures to Puerto Bello and the
ships ready to sail with them, to Spain.'
Into.the; midst of this Asiatic splendor
came Morgan and his buccaneers, and
this struggle, one of the most memora
ble on our continent, the first of white
r gainst white, led to the destruction of
the flower of Spanish chivalry and the
capture of Panama. So pass the glo
ries of the world! '
SWIMMERS' CRAMP.
It' la Not . So Very Danceroua •* .the
Victim Will Keep Cool.
If swlmmoi-H could be trained to keep
cool under . all , circumstances, there
would be comparatively little drown
ing among bathers and summer pleas
ure seekers. Cramp is usually assigned
as the cause when some good swimmer
drowns. But cramp ought in reality to
be nothing serious. Usually is" affects
only an arm or a leg or maybe only a
band or foot. Any moderately quod
swimmer can keep afloat with one arm
or even without the use of that, >yet
good swimmers drown often as a result
of cramp. If such fatalities. were ana
lyzed, they would be more properly
classed as drowning from fright and
loss of nerve. This comes from the fact
that every one is taught in childhood
Jo fear the water and. cjimeg" as . a
grown man and a Bwimmer to fear
cramp.' .The average opinion is that
the man who is attacked when swim
ming in deep water Is as good as
drowned. ' Therefore, when a swimmer
feels a leg or arm begin to cramp he is
frightened in most cases entirely out
pf his, wits. He loses his head, begins
to splash and* paw arid struggle and
then goes down.
What the swimmer should remember
is that he can keep afloat with very,
very little effort if he will turn on his
.backed keep his. chest inflated," U i$
the: simple matter of floating, -which
every . swimmer knows and finds very
easy.Mf the^wlmmer will keep cool
and float, the cramping limb will fre
quently relax after a little and he will
flpd himself as well a^ ever.— Qudpg.;
Pat's Trouble.
V.Pat had come' over to America with
the expectation of finding money lying

longjig'o. Pat had soon become disil
lusionized and was always, glad to get
hold of odd 'jobs which would net him
a little" something to j help him keep
body and soul together.- Finally, be

triously tying a rope around his waist
-when his landlord happened in on him.
After watching him curiously, for a
; few minutes he asked: - ..
"What's up, Pat? What are you try-
Ing to do?"
' "Troyin' to choke meself, ay coorse,"
was Pat's answer.'

fi ■■■ ■ . .•-.*."'.'.
Books Of travel usually contain s
vast amount of matter that Is unim
portant and a good deal that to untrue;
besides not a little that is uninterest
ing, and the old travelers who wrote
about their voyages to New York tar
nished few exceptions to the rule. ;
. Tantalizing, therefore, Is the diary «f
an observer who visited these shores
in 1679; who had a reportorial Instinct
for the. important, the»true and the in
-teresUftgf-whose Journeys "covered.. tb»
entire- territory now 'known as tbe
Greater New York; who wrote fully
and graphically of all be saw, and
whose observations have all come down
to us, with the exception of some thir
ty pages describing New York city at
the time of his visit. . Exactly that
which would now be most valuable is
lost: but, from what remains, we can
learn a good deal about the New York
of those days. ' ■ •  - ' •*._
Jaspar Dankers is the writer whose
impressions' of _ New York have thus
been lost to the world, and in what
has been preserved of his writings the
chief thing that forces its attention up
on the reader Is the magnitude of the
peach crop in these parts j during the
year of his visit. He .was a religious
enthusiast, the leader of the Labadists,
a sect that flourished briefly on three
continents toward the close of the sev
enteenth century, and his voyage com.l
panion was a minister, of the same
sect ; • ."
But there Is little of this in his diary
against a great deal of what they ate
and drank, and on occasions when
they went to the little church In the
fort where the custom house is i now
the fact is mentioned with some apolo
gies, one service being attended "In or
der to avoid scandal and for other rea
sons." und others' because "my. com*
panion Is endeavoring to learn the lan
guage." . .
But on the very day of their arrival
in New York, Sept 23, 1679, we begin
to hear of the eatables and drinkables,
especially the peaches, ■ : . ; - -
■ ','He first took us to the house of one
of his friends, who welcomed him and
us and offered us some of the fruit of
the country," very fine peaches and full
grown apples, which' filled, our hearts
with thankfulness to God. - This fruit
was exceedingly fair and good and
pleasant to the taste, jniicb' better than
that lp 1 Holland' 01? elsewhere, though
I believe our long fasting and craving
for food made It so agreeable. After
taking a glass of madeira we proceed
ed. As we walked along we saw In
different gardens trees "full of apples
of various kinds and so laden with
peaches and other fruit that one might
doubt. whether {here more leaves)
or fruit on them. 1 have never seen in
Europe in the best seasons such an
overflowing abundance.' When we fin
ished our tour and had given onr
guides several letters to. . deliver, we
returned to his father-in-law's. He re'
galed us in the evening with milk,
which refreshed us much. . We had so
many peaches set before us that we
were timid about eating them, though
we experienced no ill effects from
therp,".. . • •."--,
And the next day, Sunday, the rec
ord opens with this:- -
"I was surprised on waking to find
my. comrade had already dressed him
self and breakfasted npon peaches^ 1
So It went f very day. * Toward ' the
end of the week they crossed the ferry:
(for less than half a cent apiece) to
Long Island, where the people made
them "very welcome, sharing with us
bountifully whatever they haeU
Whether it was milk, elder, fruit or to
bacco, and especially, first and most of
all, ' miserable rum, which had been
brought' from Barbados and which Is
called by the Dutch 'kiU-devil.' These
people are very fond of it, and most of
them extravagantly so, although it la
yery dear and has'a bad taste." '
' But on Long Island, as elsewhere,
the peaches were as good as the rum
was bad.
"It Is impossible to tell how many
peach trees we passed, all laden with
fruit to breaking down and many of
them actually broken down.' We came
to a place surrounded with such trees
from wblcl) sq many had fallen' off
that the ground could not be discerned
and you could not put your foot down
without trampling them, and notwith
standing such large quantities had
fallen off the trees still were as full
as they could bear. The hogs and
other animals mostly feed ou {hem,. 1 /
The peaches in Harlem "were as plen
tiful and still more delicious. When
they went up to the north end of Man
hattan island, we find this notice:
"Before we left (Harlem) we did not
omit supplying ourselves with peaches,
which grew in. an o.rc}iar4 along the
road, Tbe whole ground was covered
with them and with apples, lying upon
the new grain with which the orchard
was planted. The peaches were the
most delicious we had yet eaten."
But they need not have taken the
precaution mentioned, for even after
crossing ' Spiiyten Duyvll they found
more peaches than ever.
"We came to a road which was en
tirely covered with peaches. We asked
the boy why they left them lie there
and did not let the hogs eat them.
Hff answered: "We do not know what
to do with them, there are so many.
The hogs are satiated with them and
•jjrill not eat any indrei' JPrpm this we
may judge of the quantity of them."—

BAYED HIS CAPITAL.
A Bank: Presl dent Who Did Hot for.
•ret Ills Old Time Friend.'
"Come In In the morning, and -the
bank will have something for you to
to." said the president of a Broadway
bank to a . meek " looking man whose
hair was white and 'whose eyes were
marked by deep crow's feet as he left
the office, with a bright look of satls^
faction on his face that had not been
there before. ■ ..-, .-. ...-.'/.
'"Let me tell you a story," said the
president as he motioned to me to re
main. "I „ was living in lowa, and
three city lots composed the capital
that I looked to to give me a start in
business.' I held on to them for a long
time. while working for $35 a month
In a real estate office until they had
advanced In value to $3,000, when 1
gold them to a St Louis man. ■ -. i
"It "was nearly 3 o'clock, and I hur
ried to the bank. I made ont the de
posit slip and laid it, with my gold and
bankbook,' In front of " the receiving
teller. . 7 ' : ; \
ii MltM 1t is closing time now,' he said,
'and you had better not make your de
posit until morning.* ,
"'Charley,' I said, for I knew him
well, that is ridiculous. . It is a half
minute before closing time, and I in
sist that you take my deposit I don't
want to be robbed of all that I have on
earth before morning.'.,, ;..
" 'I will fix it for you,' he said as he
gathered up the money aiuj bankbook
and disappeared jin the . vault with
them. In a minute he was back, and
I was astonished at his actions. J
■ :"1 have put it In my private box,"
he continued, "where \\ will be safe,
and in the morning you can make tbe
deposit If you want tOt 1 ..'- ■ "V
'■Next morning the bank's failure
was announced.
: "I hurried to Charley's house, which
was near by, and asked him abqut the
bank. vi. j* li . - " .? !
" 'Yes, i,t has failed and won't pay a
cent' he said. 'Just five minutea t>e*
fore you came in with your money yes
terday the directprs decided not to
open fhls morning. I "was told to give
out no Information until business hours
today, and that is the reason I didn't
tell you. If you had made your de
posit, the money would have all gone,
Now it is safe in my box, and you can
have it flfly moment you please,' -;'■ j [
VI did get it, and it was the founda^
tlori of my fortune. The man who was
just here is that Charley, and was the
teller who. saved my capital for me."
POULTRY POINTERS
Pure \yater is more essential than
clean grass, „;'" ; < >j
Even though turkeys are good for
agers It will not pay to let them go
without proper feeding. '
• Everything In the rearing of young
poultry depends upon their care and
management at least until well feath
ered.
Fowls inclined to fatten too easily
are not good layers. . The flesh they
carry makes them lasty, anfl this never
promotes laying.
Middlings make a good food for pouK.
try, but if wet' up alone it is too sticky.
The better plan Is to mix ■ with bran
or corn and wet with milk or scalding
water, i
AVhltewash la better than paint on
the poultry houses, for the reason- that
it costs less and has a purifying Influ
ence. It may be applied as often 'as
once a month to advantage.
The properties of sunflower seefl are
peculiar, and a small quantity fed at
the proper time will essentially aid in
Imparting to the plumage of adult
fowls a gloss that no other grain will
produce. ■
Gainsborough and Hl* Carrier.
One of tbe earliest members of the
Boyal academy, It was Gainsborough's
custom to have his pictures conveyed'
to the metropolis by a prosperous Lon
don carrier, a Mr. Wiltshire of Shock-:
erwick, near Bath. This man refused
to accept payment on the ground that ;
he loved pictures too well. He was'
not, however, allowed to go unreward-'
ed, for Gainsborough, presented him.
with six of his best works, and some
idea of their ultimate value, may be
gained 'from the fact that when at 1
length they were sold tbe National gal
lery secured two. "The Parish Clerk of
Bradford-on-Avon," for 500 guineas,:
and "The Harvest Wagon," for £2,500,
these prices being considered j low.

FRIDAY OCTOBER 10, 1902
For Governor.
GEORGE C. PARDEE, of Oakland
Congress, J. N. GILETTE, Humboldt
A. Caminetti gave utterance to
some very foolish remarks in his
speech Saturday ui»ht. He. not
only proclaimed from the housetop
that some mysterious whisperings
had been made about a certain
criminal transaction, thereby setting
the whole couoty agog to know the
nature of the whisperings alluded
to, which concerned a candidate of
his own party, and which would no
doubt have remained in possession
of a small circle of tattlers only had
they not thus been thrust into tbe
full glare of publicity; but he made
some reflections upon tbe present
assessor, J. Marchant, which we be
lieve he is unable to substantiate.
He told his hearers that discrimina
tion was made in favor of the large
property holders, and against the
small taxpayer; that one mine, for
which an offer of $300,000 had been
refused, was assessed at a nominal
figure. He left his hearers in the
dark as to tbe particular mine re
' ferred to, and for that reason alone
the charge is unworthy of credence
or notice. After some inquiry, we
have been informed that the old
Eureka mine at Sutter Creek,' which
has been idle for twenty-five years,
is owned by Mrs Hetty Green of New
York^is probably the property re
ferred to. This opening plea from the
democratic side is a fair illustration
of their tactics. Why mask the at
tack by indefiniteness? Why select
a dormant and perhaps worked-out
mine, owned too outside the state?
Why thus make it impossible to
either verify or disprove the story?
Why did not Mr Caminetti . present
his proofs, if he has any, before the
board of supervisors in an applica
tion to have the assessment" in
creased? Is he not aware that a few
years back an attempt was made to
boost this . property on the assess
ment roll before the board, which
was then democratic, and the board
very properly refused to interfere.
JT The truth is, the assessment roll
.of Amador county has been in
creased during the past four years
of Mr Marchan t's term of office in
the sum of about $500,000 in. round
nmnbers, by far the heaviest increase
in one term that has been made
within our knowledge. The first year
of Marchant's term the assessed val
uation was swelled to the tune of
half a million dollars. It is well
known that this increase was not
' due primarily to any actual rise of
value, but rather to an effort to
equalize the burden of taxation, by
raising town property and produc
ing mines. It was the only system
atic effort ever made by an assessor
to facetthis difficult problem. And
now comes the democratic speaker,
at a time when only one mine in the
county is on a dividend-paying basis,
and tries to make party capital by
advocating increased assessment of
the mining industry, upon which,
more than all other interests com
bined, tbe prosperity of Amador
county depends.
A few weeks ago the Ledger asked
its cotemporary to explain why the
superior judge of this county was
absent from his post of duty for two
. months in the year 1900, and did not
return in time to naturalize several
persons who desired to vote that
year, although he was receiving a
salary of $3500 per year to remain
here and attend to the duties of bis
. office. No answer has yet been
made, and we now also ask why the
superior judge ' of this county was
absent at different periods of time
during his eight years' incumbency,
which in all aggregates several
months, when receiving pay to be
here, and 2 compelling persons who
had business before his court to go
. to the expense of going.to San Fran
cisco or elsewhere to procure his
services, several instances of which
could be given. Much stress seems
to be laid by the supporters of Judge
Rust on the fact that his opponent
did not return to this county im
mediately after the legislature ad
journed after his pay as an assembly
man had stopped, but they are silent
when the question of Judge Rust's
many absences from the county
while his pay was going on, are men
tioned. The assembly journal shows
Fred L. Stewart missed but one day
during the session while under pay
from the state, and never did au as
semblyman from this county serve
the people more faithfully. He has
lived in Amador county from in
fancy, being here long before Judge
Rust ever came. Was educated in
its schools, and left the cpunty in
1833 to obtain employment so that
be could put himself through the
State Law School in San Francisco,
and after graduation be came' back
to lone and opened an office, and
practiced there continuously ■ until
he came to Jackson in 1900 to take
charge of the practice of attorney
McGee, while Mr. McGee was in
Europe. Mr. Stewart has been a
registered voter of this county since
he opened a law office in the county,
is still the assemblyman from this
county, and proposes to continue to
make Amador county his home. It
is to the credit of Mr. Stewart that
this is the only objection they are
able to urge against him for the
office to which ■he aspires. His
ability, his character, and his legis
lative record cannot be attacked. , •

A SUCCESSFUL SALE.
The Power of an Advertisement When
It's Backed up by Facts.
The Red Front store has advertised
through the medium of this paper a
sale, 1 that was to begin on Monday last.
Those who witnessed the rush at its
doors on Monday morning,, have con
vinced themselves' of the power of
printer's ink.
Of course, an advertisement alone is
not sufficient when there is no body to
it. Nice words are all right, but they
do not bring the desired results unless
they are backed up by facts. People
like to trade only with those that do
what they say. .- :
The wide circulation of this paper,
and the honesty of The Red 'Front's
force have helped to make their "sea
son opening sale" a success.
On Monday, October 6th, they
opened the store at 5 o'clock in the
morning and closed at 11:30 p. m. The
whole day long large bundles were
going- out of the store.' The es
tablishment was crowded to its full.
In whole, they have done on that day
a bigger business than the entire week
previous to the beginning of the sale.
Those that have now for the first
time given a response to their "ads,"
have left the store with the satisfac
tion that it is really "Jackson's Cheap
est Dry Goods Store. " *i

Great Register.
The number of names on the great
regiSter vof Amador county is .3256
against 3166 on the register of two
years ago. This shows an increase of
90, which, on a basis of one voter for
every four persons, would indicate an
increased population of 360.* It is prob
able, however, that the Increase in the
electoral roll is partly owing to. a closer
registration of voters. The candi
dates for office -would naturally take,,
and in fact have taken, an interest in
getting every man on the ■ voting list.

' «3enoe ilio past week. No doubt Jack

. eanims£, that infest the main street
■ au'd annoy people. But to get rid of
..them by lay injj ""poison is » 'practice
that cannot be indorsed. It is mon«
oyeP against tho la-v.' Two. dogs were
poisoned on Main street last Saturday.
It is strange that such illegal practices'
are allowed without any apparent ef
fort to get at the root of the matter.
A laughable scene occurred on Water
(Street Wednesday morning. A stra;
Aog at the bulldog type, wandercc
into Giaoccbto's warehouse, j Espying
a choice selection of salama which Mr.
Graffino, the manager of Ginocchio's,
had laid ready for distribution to the
customers of the establishment, he
took the choicest ono and sailed up
Water street with the delicacy in its
mouth. Mr. Graffino gave chase, and .
using a lot of choice Italian language
persuaded the canine thief to drop its!
prey. The salama was recovered intact. <
Case Dismissed.
We mentioned last week that S.. A.
Jones, late of the Jackson Herald, was
arrested in San Francisco on a charge
of beatlug a board bill due Mrs. Smith,'
amounting to $60. Constable ■ Kay
went to San Francisco specially to ar
rest him, and brought him back to
Jackson and lodged him in jail. The
constable could not do otherwise. The
district attorney having . ordered the
warrant of arrest to issue, it was his
duty to serve it and bring his prisoner
to Jackson to await the further action
of the court. Jones was brought back
two weeks ago next Sunday, and being
unable to give bail, - he was lodged in
jail, and was there until Thursday last.
The only object in view, as the sequel
shows, in his arrest, was to endeavor
"to get him to pay the board bill and
costs. The scheme turned out an ex
pensive fai'ure. There is a law which
provides that any person who surrepti
tiously leaves for the purpose of beat
ing a hotel-keeper, etc., is guilty of a
misdemeanor. We shall not inquire
into the question of whether the law
was or was not applicable to the case
under discussion. Instead of scaring
Jones into paying the bill — even as
suming that he was able to pay it — it
nerved him to stand firm. He "got J.
W. Caldwell to attend to his case.
After trying to. get the case set for
trial, without avail, a writ of habeas
corpus was sued out, which was set for
liearing- yesterday morning. This
brought tho matter to a focus. Before
the time set for hearing, the, habeas
corpus proceedings were dropped in
the superior court, and the case dis
missed in the, justice court, and the
prisoner released. Jones was confined
in jail eleven days. He was boarded at
public expense during that time.
Furthermore the costs of court and
constable fees will amount to something
like $40, and the county treasury ' will
no doubt be called upon to foot the
bills. ■ This comes of trying to collect a
debt by criminal process. If the mat
ter was undertaken with the view of
meting out punishment for a crime, the
query arises, 'Why was the case dis
missed by ' the prosecution without
trial? The defendant has been turned
loose 150 miles from home, without
means to get back to the place from
whence he was forcibly brought by
criminal process. Mrs. Smith can ill
afford to lose the money, and we hope
she will get it. But she realized that
keeping- the debtor in jail would not
help the matter. - v It was a disastrous
move all round.
Bad Indeed.
. Losing flesh is indeed ■a . bad sign.

ment, for consumption, - take ■ Scott's

A ■ Misrepresentation.
Some one,' hot particularly careful of
the truths i sent a special ? to ' the
Examiner regarding the Gillette meet
ing in Jackson. It stated that a torch
light procession was contemplated, -but
had to be abandoned for lack of inter
est, and a lot' of other stuff equally
false. The settled policy of democracy
this trip seems to be to try to belittle
the republican meetings and - magnify
democratic- gatherings," and thereby
convey ttio idea that the republicans
are lukewarm, while democrats are
enthusiastic. .In Amador county, the
reverse is the case. If the tactics re
sorted to here are a sample of the
methods pursued throughout the state,
the Lane managers must be depending
more upon the efficacy of hot air to
elect their candidates than the strength
of the men before the voters. So far
as the campaign has progressed ' in
Amador, there can bo no comparison
between the enthusiasm of the repub
licans, and the dullness of the demo
cratic meetings.. They are evidently
trying to fake Lane and the congress
ional nominees into office. It won't
work. . . : ■ , .• . .

A tremendous explosion occurred in
the ice vault of the. Jackson brewery
plant" on Tuesday •afternoon. It ap
pears that a. huge vat of twenty-four
barrels capacity was purcharged* with
carbonic acid gas. .Unable to sustain
the pressure it burst with * a thunder
ing roar, shattering the windows and
throwing fragments of glass across the
street. A piece of the giant tub struck
the pipe leading to the Ice plant con
taining ammoniacal gas, bursting the
pipe and setting the gas free. There
was nobody in the cellar, hence no
casualty except the loss of about 20
barrels x>f good lager and the vat. It
will cost fully «20fl to replace the vat.

THE AIMADOR LEDGER; JACKSON, CALIFOBNIA, FBIDAY, OCTOBER 10. 1902,
GILLETTE MEETING
The Campaign Auspiciously Opened
by Eepublicans— Big Turnout. ■
The Hon. J. N. Gillette, republican
candidate for congress, addressed the
citizens of Jackson in Love's hall on
Monday evening-, . and received 'an
ovation that was flattering to himself
and a credit to his party friends. It
was a practical answer to the efforts
which had been made only two even
ings before by the' democratic gather
ing to array section against section,
and interest against Interest in. this
district. It told plainer than words
could express that the voters take
no stock in appeals to prejudice.
They are not to bo carried away from
the real issues by demagogic tactics re
sorted to by tho speakers of the party
without a policy. Ihe hall was packed
to overflowing. There was twice as
many voters there as graced the previ
ous meeting, and standing room was
all monopolized. Bonfires blazed in
the street, and a generous use of giant
powder in the way of salute, while the
Jackson band enlivened the town with
music. The hall was tastefully deco
rated by members of the Jackson club,
assisted by several ladies..' In front : of
the stage was displayed the portrait of
Lincoln, while the rear was deco
rated with a large picture of William
McKinley, supplemented with a bounti-.
ful display of flags and bunting,' and
flowers. ;
The meeting was called to order by
Dr. C. A. Herrick; as chairman of the
county committee, and C. H. Mc-
Kenney was then elected to preside,
and in a few appropriate, words ac;
knowledged the compliment, and an
nounced a long list of vice-presidents,
who were called upon to take seats
upon the platform.
The Oneida glee club, comprising five
young men who are employed at the
Oneida mine, was next introduced, and
sang a taking campaign song, about
Pardee. - It was greeted with a j storm
of applause, and an encore demanded.
J. N. Gillette was then introduced as
the speaker of the evonidg. ' Mr.
Gillette is making - his canvass, alone.
He is unattended by any other speaker,
and if local talent is not secured to help
out the evening, the burden falls ex
clusively upon him. - This was the case
in Jackson. It was, however, no draw
back, as the man from Humboldt is a
host in himself. While it cannot be
said that he is a magnetic orator, be
gave a plain, straightforward, honest
talk, touching the issues involved. He
stated that he was present at the meet
ing- Saturday, and - felt it incumbent
upon him to refer to some of the re
marks which he had heard. He said
the first congressional district was , by
far the largest district, territorially
considered, in California. It was one
of the largest in tho United Stated. It
embraced mountains, and forest and
valleys, and was perhaps the richest in
natural resources in the state. \ Its in
terests were diversified. A consider
able portion of the district was devoted
to the mining industry, while pastoral,'
agricultural, and lumber interests were
also large, j Mr. Ford had stated that
because he lived in the mining county
of Nevada, Be was therefore in position
to understand the wants of a district
like this better than a representative
from a non-mineral, county. . What
are the facts. ■ Mr. Ford was born in a
cow county, so was be (the speaker).
Mr. Ford was educated for the legal
profession, so was he.' His opponent
moved to Nevada county, and he to
Humboldt./ Mr. Ford had never done
a day's work in a mine, neither had he.
He strongly denounced the claim that
because of -his residence he was' not
able to represent all the" Interests of the
district. In- the legislature he had
charge of the bill appropriating $250,000.
to aid the mining interests, particularly
of Nevada county, and it was passed.'
He owed his nomination to the support
given him by Nevada — the roost im
portant gold, mining county in the
district. ' • •
He spoke at length; about the trust
issue, upon which the democrats were
laying so much b tress. What had the
democratic party done to solve the
problem. . When the anti-trust bill was
before congress, Introduced by a re
publican member and supported by re
publicans, the democrats voted against
it, and defeated it. The first step in
the way. of curbing- monopolies
known as trusts was opposed by demo
crats. Only one-eighth of the pro
ducts pf the country were now pro
duced by the trusts. The republican
party was able to deal with,' and could
be depended upon jto deal with these
combinations when it becomes . nec
essary. l _
' He spoko on tho tariff, and showed
clearly how the nation had prospered
under the republican policy-. When
ever the democrats had control, a tariff
for revenue was adopted, depression
and hard times' were the result. Full
employment, good wages, ' and ■ pros-!
perity had returned with tho return to
power of the republicans and a pro
tective tariff. Mr. Gibson on Saturday
night admitted that the tariff had
something to do with the general pros
perity prevailing, and yet the demo
cratic state' platform recently adopted
denounced the republican tariff" system.
and demanded a tariff for revenue only.
In California during tho past year, 3 the.
money in the saving banks had in
creased ten million dollars— the savings
of the working classes — showing the
prosperity existing. Tho main issue
befpre'the pepplo in the congressional
contest was to let Veil epough . alone,
by supporting the p^rty that" bad con
ducted the nation to its present great
ness and Industrial activity by voting
for ' the candidates who were in full
sympathy with the party in power. .

DEMOCRATIC RALLY
The First Meeting a Frost.— A Tarn*
Affair Throughout.
-The opening of the ■'campaign^ in
Jackson from a democratic standpoint,
took. place Saturday evening 1 , at which
time tbe candidate for congress in the
first district, T. S. Ford, and others
were announced to address tbe people
in Love's hall. ; At the appointed hour
the seating capacity of the ball was
filled, the majority being non-voters—
women and children. J. L. Sargent
was selected as chairman of the meet
ing, and half . a dozen vice presidents
were selected to form the background
of the platform. .' : After a few", remarks
by the chairman, T. S. Ford, the con
gressional aspirant, was' announced.
We were unable to be present 'to .hear
his remarks, but from all that we can
gather from those who did hear him
he failed. to impress the audience as the
possessor of any of the attributes that
go to make up the live congressman
always on the lookout for the interests
of bis. constituents.'
■' A. Caminetti was the next speaker.
By the time he got the floor the voting
strength of tlie" audience was nearly
doubled by the advent of the 'members
of the;republican_club, v who, had just
adjourned . from a business .meeting.
Mr. Caminetti was not at his best. He
had no theme to discuss except . the
personalty of the candidates, and 'he
did riot confine himself even to that
numerous subject, ;■■* but : branched off
several times, to exhibit his usual spleen
and good/judgment by. attacking 'the
Ledger and its editor. /Somehow the
Ledger under its present management
has always been a live issue with demo
cratic stumpers in Amador county. Be
predicted that Lane would be the next
governor of California,* and at the same
time told the audience that he was at
the head of the democratic committee
that had charge of the campaign. - He
wanted the people to vote for Ford be
cause he had rendered him assistance
when he (Caminetti) was making his
canvass for congress years ago. . He
had traveled with him,' at his own ex
pense, and he was grateful to him for
it, and hoped the voters would show
their gratitude by voting for him also.
Another plea made for Ford was that
be was from a mining county. This
was a mining district, and should be
represented by a mining man from the
mining section, who, would, according
to his specious process of reasoning,
know more about the needs of the dis
trict than one from elsewhere. . By
this kind of argument our townsman
and manager of the campaign for the
"terrified," would knock out Hum
bold t — the most populous and wealthy
county in. the district— because iiFdoes
not happen to have large quartz mines
within its borders. The speaker next
tackled the local ticket.. Sargent
ought to be elected because he was a
.former school teacher and from Ama
dorcounty. Judge Rust should be re-
■elected because ' he was fastened - to
'Amador county. His advocacy of U S
Gregory was unique. He informed his
hearers, most of whom bad probably
never heard of the matter before, that
it was being whispered around that the
reason why the sheriff did not capture
young Gates for the hold-up at Pic
pardo's, was because of private con
siderations. He was not explicit, but
left his hearers to get at the bottom of
the matter by individual inquiry. In
advocating John Mathis for assessor,
he intimated that the present assessor,
Marchant, favors the mine owners and
wealthy taxpayers, to the detriment of
the small property holders. He cited
a case within hi 3 knowledge where a
princely sum was offered for a mine,
and the same was assessed at a mere
nominal figure. He again forgot to
mention the mine or the owners. We
believe the local democracy would do
the cause of its candidates more good
by muzzling Caminetti for the balance
of the campaign. For instance In ex
tolling Gregory, he remarked that as a
lawyer he was.the hardest man he had
ever run against in the practice of his
profession in the criminal cases. That
was no doubt a statement of fact. The
lasFcrlminal case . in which Caminetti
appeared as attorney for defendant,
and indeed the last trial bad in the
superior court in this county, was the
Macquarrie case,' and the testimony
elicited on that occasion fully sustains
the orator's opinion, but not the argu
ment for his re-election based thereon.
W. M. Gibson was the next speaker,
and his harangue capped tho climax,
He is a glib talker, and the only at
tention paid to him was on account
of the wild and intemperate nature of
his remarks. - He said he was here in
early days, and had a vivid recollection,
although at that time only a "kid," of
a scene which, took place on the main
Street' pf Jackson jn which a tree and" a
rope played a conspicuous part. This
reference to mob law and violence was
characteristic of his speech through
out. . He said men were of two classes —
the broad-minded men and the narrow
minded men. It was soon manifest to
his hearers which class he belonged to,
Certain views on the subject of educa
tion which he had read in the Ledger
that day didn't suit him, and he ex
pressed the opinion that a man holding
such ideas ought to be run out of the
community. A -broad-minded man is
Gibson? If a man failed tq come up tp
his line pf thought, he was in favor of
shipping him tOßOroo other community.
That is the extent of his notion of
freedom of speech and of the press.
What a political walkover the demo
cratic party would have if the views of
this intolerant advocate could only be
enforced. He next tackled the great
strike in the anthracite coal regions.
He eulogized President Roosevelt for
trying to settia the matter; eulogized
president Mitchell, the representative
pf the strikers, for the terms pf cpm
promise which he offered, and con
demned the mloo owners because they
did not settle the dispute. At this
juncture the audience began to melt
away. Many were so thoroughly dis
gusted with the Incendiary . tendency
of the utterances, that they left. They
were not wining that their presence
should by any possibility In construed
THE OLD RELIABLE

Absolutely Purer
THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE
as countenancing such rabid talk. We
are informed that this platform
ornament went on to discuss the trusts
and other : evils from, a democratic
standpoint, incident, to the present un
paralleled prosperity : of the United
States, and declared that the people
were bound to have redress from the
existing wrongs— that if they-could not
get it by " theywbuld eventu
ally by "bullets." This is a free
country. "It is perhaps inevitable that
the very freedom which constitutes our
crown of glory will always be abused
by agitators ; of the" Gibson jj pattern.
But that such persons should' be em
ployed to "stump in the interest of a
national party passes comprehension.
From a partisan standpoint the repub
lican party ought to be grateful for the
valuable aid given by such orators.
But | how a candidate for a seat In
the national legislature can, by ac
cepting the services of such extremists',
and thereby tacitly endorsing the
sentiments oppressed, expect- to .win
the votes of intelligent American citi
zens, absolutely trips our understand
ing.

The Worst Form-
Multitudes are singing the praises of
Kodol, the new discovery, which is
making so many sick people well and
weak people strong by digesting what
they eat, by cieansing and sweetening
the stomach and by transforming their
food into the kind of i pure, rich, red
blood that makes you feel good all
over. .Mrs.j.CranfiUV of Troy, I. T.,
writes: * For a" number of years I was
troubled with indigestion and dyspep
sia which grew into the worst form.
Finally I was induced to use Kodol and
after using four bottles I am entirely
cured. I heartily recommend Kodol
to all sufferers from indigestion and
dyspepsia.' Take a dose after meals.
It digests what you eat. Kerr's Phar>

CALLING UPON A FRIEND.
fhe "Way In Which Two English A*
tors Once Paid a Visit.
Here is "an amusing story of Messrs.
Toole and Brough, the English comedi
ans. | Having appeared conjointly in a
drama, "Dearer Than Life," In which
they wore very ragged, woebegone cos
tumes,' they visited the well known
artists - Fradelle and Marshall to be
photographed in their rags. While
waiting /'between the plates" Toole,
tvho was fond of a lark, suggested to
his brother' comedian. to sally out and
call upon a certain mutual acquaint
ance, who would be horribly shocked
at receiving visitors in such a garb.
Brough at once assented, and, popping
on their battered hats, out into the
street the pair slipped and made for
the house of their friend. Of course
the neat housemaid and the neater
Buttons were horrified and declined
even without being asked to purchase
matches or the like.
"I axes your pardon," said Toole in
an assumed tone. "You're making a
slight mistake. We want to see your
master." j And he mentioned the gen
tleman's Christian name and that of
his wife.
"We have important business with
him," chimed in Brough.
- The girl's face wore a dazed aspect,
and she said: '.'Master never sees the
likes of you at his house. He's most
pertlckler, ain't he, Charles?" appeal-
Ing to the page. "You must be making
a mistake."
''Ob, no, we ain't!" responded Toole
with supreme gravity. "But I'm sor
ry William"— the Christian name of
the gentleman— "ls out. I haven't got
a- card about me," pretending to fum
ble among his rags, "but tell your mas
ter that his two cousins from the work
house . called as they were passing
through London."— London Tit-Bits.
PENNY POSTAGE.
The Incident That Led it, it* Estab-

Many years ago, when Queen Vic
toria first began to reign, It cost nine
pence to 6end a letter from one Eng
lish city to another. In those days the
postage was not paid by the sender
of the letter, as Is now customary, but
by the receiver.. So, of coursej there
were many poor people who could not
afford to pay nlnepence when then
mail arrived, and it often happened
that they were obliged to forfeit the
letters. - •
One day a man named Rowland Hill
was riding on the outskirts of a city,
and he saw a postman bring a letter to
a young girl and demand ninepence
for it The girl took the letter, scru
tinized it carefully and then handed it
back to the man, saying she could not
afford to pay f he. postage. Thereupon,
Rowland Hill, being a kind hearted
man, rode up and Insisted upon paying
It himself." When the postman had
gone, the girl confessed to her bene
factor that the fejter was from her
Jpver, and to avoid paying nlnepence
on'every letter he made certain marks
on the envelope which she alone could
decipher. ' .
:"Put," said,, Rowland Hill, J "don't
you kjaow "you ■ are ' doing something
yery dishonest in flius cheating the
government?"
The girl admitted she did, but there
was no other way to do.
Hill rode away and meditated over
this little incident, and his farfamed
Idea of "penny postage" was the re
sult. At first he was laughed at by
every one, but be fought bravely and
finally was rewarded . by s,eeing bis
Idea in practice all over the land.— New
York Tribune.
A Japanese Retraction.
The art of retracting without taking
anything back— lf the bull may be al
lowed—seems to be understood in Ja
pan. A young orator at a political
meeting called a public ofielal a thief.
A policeman on duty gravely rose and
addressed a remark In a low tone to
the speaker, who thereupon said, "The
chief of police requests me to retract
the word which I have just spoken.
Although the word of a sage should
never re-enter, let U9 make a conces
sion; let us take bark the word and
keep the idea." Great applause and
cries of "Bravo!" greeted the orator's
escape- from his dilemma.— Youth's

» DINED IN THE KITCHEN.
One Satisfactory Meal Grant Had
After' Bis Tonr.of the World.
•"When General Grant stopped at th«
Palmer House In Chicago on his re
turn from his tour of the world," saW
a man who was there at the time, "the
steward was all but stupefied one noon
at seeing the ex-president slide In at
the kitchen door as though escaping
from some one. .' ; •■ '
*• 'I am sorry to trouble you,' he said,
as though asking a great favor, 'but
may I have a little corned beef and
cabbage?'
"'Why, certainly,' the steward re
plied; 'but shan't I send it out to you
in the dining room?'
"'No,' he answered; 'I'll eat It right
here if you'll let me sit down.' ;
"So a place on the rough board table,
where the cook had been fixing the
meat, was cleared, and Grant drew up
a stool and set to, and the way he
got away with that corned' beef and
cabbage was a caution. When he had
finished, he laid down . bis knife and
fork with a funny sigh of satisfaction,
put one hand on the steward's shoulder
and said:
" 'Young man, I don't suppose you
care for that at all, but if you had had
to eat what I have for the past few
months it would taste like a dinner for (
the gods. It tastes homey!'
"The ex-president had dined with
everybody from the queen down, but
that cabbage and corned beef doubt
less reminded him of the time when
he was not so well known, but proba
bly far happier— when people in" St
Louis called him 'captain' when they
spoke to him and bought the wood he
carted into town to sell."
Character at a Glance.
An Insignificant nose means an In
significant man. An open mouth Is a
sure sign of an .empty head (keep yours
closed). A projecting upper lip shows
malignity and avarice. Pointed noses
generally belong to meddlesome peo
ple. Large eyes in a small face betok
en maliciousness. •-
A retreating chin Is always bad; it
shows lack of resolution. A projecting
under lip Indicates ostentation, self
conceit and folly. Fine hair generally
betokens native good taste and Intelli
gence.
A dimple In the chin Is pretty, but
indicates weak mental organization.
High cheek bones always indicate
great force of character in some direc-.
tion. Fullness of the temples is sup
posed to show powers, of mathematical
calculation. ,
A small mouth, with nose and nostril
also small, shows indecision and cow
ardice. Half shut eyes show natural
shrewdness, together with lack of sin
cerity. Slow moving eyes are always
found In the heads of persons of pru
dence and ability. — London Answers. '
Wheat In Fable and History.

Introduced to Lord Roberts the. wit

STRENGTH IN SOME FORM.
•"be Quality Above xjj Bla« TOM
Woman Admires Ia Man.
j Women abhor cowards and still more
Riioaks, though I regret to say they
often endure cads in a way that belies
then- Intelligence and good taste. They
have a quite pathetic desire to look up
to men, to feel men their superiors lo
strength of body and of mind, In calm
ness of Judgment and clearness of In
tellect. And it Is Indeed a pity that
men. so often seem to go out of their
way to destroy their most, cherished
Illusions.
Above everything a woman admires
strength in a man. It may be strength
of body— she will worship a Hercules
with the brain of a guinea pig. It may
be strength of Intellect— she will adore
a savant with 'the body of a gibbon
monkey. It may be strength of char
acter—she will break her heart for a
politician or a financier who Is un
swervingly wrapped up In dreams of
personal advancement, and who pos
sesses no ' iuore heart than an 'oyster.
But strength in some form she craves
unceasingly. It is a hereditary • In
stinct that has been bequeathed to her
through Eve's first disappointment
when Adam. was tried In the. balance
and found wanting. Woman, secretly
conscious of her own physical weak
ness and lack of Intellectual strength,
demands strength'- from man to make
up for her own deficiencies. . Even the
strongest women,- strong In body, and
mind, well balanced as Athene herself,
though they may shield and protect
the weakness of the men they love
and stoop to help them, win never do
so without a secret feeling of contempt
which Is destruction of all ideals, Man,
in spite of that deplorable. start made
by Adam, was Intended to be woman's
protector and refuge from all harm,
upon whom she could lean and rely In
every evti-i cf life's pilgrimage, and
when the roles are reversed, as they
often so unfortunately are, It is a bad
thing both for man : and ' woman.'
Strength, however, Is what women
love In men.— Lady Colin Campbell. !
PRECOCIOUS AUTHORS.
Successful Plays That "Were Written
by Boys In Their Teens.
Was a successful play ever written'
by a boy of fourteen? asks a corre-;
spondent. Yes. This seeming miracle'
hits happened at least three times. The
best known example .of the precocious
playwright is the celebrated Lope tie
la Vega, the most prolific dramatist
known to history. He produced his
first play, a comedy, entitled "La Pas v
toral de Jaclnto," before he had com-,
pleted his fourteenth year, and this
was considered such, a marvelous per
formance that be is known to this tla.v
In Spanish literature as "the Prodigy
of Nature." . Another Spaniard and con-;
temporary of La Vega, Pedro Calde
ron, wrote his first play when he was
thirteen. Metastasfo .wrote his tragedy
"Giustino" and had it produced when'
he was fourteen on the stage at 80-'
logna. .
j Of English playwrights Douglas Jer
rold, the famous author of "Black
Eyed Susan," also furnishes an answer
to the question. In 1818, before he had
completed his fifteenth year, he wrote
a very well known farce entitled
"More Frightened Than Hurt," It was
very successful on the English stage,
and the French considered it good
enough to steal. Curiously enough,
this French translation was retrans
lated into English and again produced
on the English boards under the title
of "Fighting by Proxy." Another very
remarkable instance of a different sort
of precocity was that of William Hen
ry Ireland, who "when he was about
fifteen actually produced, some plays,
'which be attributed to Shakespeare
and which, although afterward proved
to be forgeries, were accepted by the.
experts of the time as genuine.—Pear
son's Weekly, j-Vr'.

THE COLLECTOR WHO KNEW
An Illustration of the Dangrer of Bel
ins Too Self Confident.
"The trouble with' you 'fellows is
you want things, but you know noth
ing about 'em. You coini* over here
and carry home a lot of ti'u-k that a
European ■ collector |wbu~a't give
house room, and when you s;-e a really
pood thing you don't know* it. or you
won't pay a price for It unless some
dealer makes you. You see, you don't
know; that's what's the matter; how
can you? Nobody Jn America wanted
antiques before the Centennial. If
you'd lived here twenty years, like me,
you'd learu something, you'd find out
thaf collecting Isn't a thing of money,
but knowing."
-We had been walking In Venice
down a narrow calle .while the collect
or was speaking. "Look at that old
brass scale," he resumed, pointing to a
fish stall in the little outdoor market
on which we had just . emerged.
"There's a gem, not very old, but of
the finest seventeenth century Venetian
work. If you saw that in a New. York
dealer's, all cleaned up, you'd give up
a good deal for It; but you'd 'a' passed
it by a dozen times If I hadn't spoken
about It. See that old Junk stand over
there? I never pass -a thing like that.
You can never tell what you may pick
upn-lf you only kno-vc"
We had scarcely* reached the stand
when the collector thrust out his hand
with the swiftness of a hawk darting
on Its prey, and swooped upon a little
Jewel box.
"Carnellanj Russian, 1 should ■ say,
from the Ural mountains. . It's not of.
great value, but It's a ; pretty little
thing, if it was cleaned up. - It's mine,'
anyway." To the keeper of the stall:
"Quanto?" : \ • <
The Venetian slowly uncoiled him
self and came down from the church
Steps, where he-had been sleeping.
"Does the slgnore want the pretty
trifle? The slgnore knows Its value
better than I, and he'll be generous?" !
"I'll give you a lira" for it It Isn't
worth it, but one mustn't be hard with'
the poor."
."I had hoped 1 should get fiveP'
"Well, I'll make it two."
"It is the signore's." .
. "There, you see!" exultingly chuckled
the collector. . "That's what It Is to
know. An exquisite cornelian Russian
Jewel casket for 40 cents! You'd never
have. thought of looking among a lot
of rusty old Iron for a thing like that
would you?" i v
While speaking he held the box with
a miser's clutch.
"May I see It, please?"
He reluctantly handed it to me as
though fearing I might make a sud
den dash down the calle with his treas
ure.
"Phew!" said I contemptuously,
handing the box back to him. "It's not
carnellan at all. It's glass, nothing but
glass."
"Glass!" drawing a magnifier from:
his waistcoat pocket and mutely ex-,
a mining the .purchase. . "I'm— l'm—
afraid— it is!" he said sheepishly.
"Of course it is."
"I-<lon't know," sadly. "Yes, it Is'
glass! You see, It's so dirty. Oh, well,
we all make mistakes at times. Do
you want it?" disgust taking the place
of sadness. "You can have it for a
quarter." ....
■ "Well, I guess it's worth a quarter."
I think my eyes must have snapped.
"Yes."
And that Is how an almost .unique
example of the cinque cento came into
my collection of Venetian glass.— New
