Petition for Rehearing. '
In the case of Fred Martin on
habeas corpus, recently decided by
the Supreme court, Solinsky & Wehe,
Paul Morf, John Hancock, the attor
neys for the mine owners, have filed a
petition for a rehearing. This is the
somewhat celebrated case brought 'to
test the eight hour law as applied, to
miners, and in which the court sus
tained the constitutionality of the law.
As the case was heard in bane, and the
decision was clear and specific, cover
ing every point in the case, with no
dissenting opinion, the probability that
a rehearing will be granted is very
small. — Prospect.

FOR FLETCHER'S
C ASTORIA
RAINCHERIA MASSA
CRE RECALLED
True Story of This Great
The Lynching
Continned from last week.
Two or three hundred miners had
gathered at Rancheria— intent upon tak
ing the lives of two Mexicans, one of
whom had been arrested just above the
place on suspicion that he had been in
directly connected with the murderous
band. He was seen during the night of
the massacre carrying a torch a few
hundred yards above the town. Whis
pers went out that he was one of the
gang that had built the fire in the center
of the street immediatey following the
massacre. The men who had congre
gated about the place were a sturdy, un
couth lot of miners of pioneer days
each with a revolver swinging close to
his side. Passion alone guided this
howling boistrous throng, bent, on
revenge and thirsting for the blood of
any and all of this ' murderous gang.
The blood of the victims -of the mas
sacre had dried in patches upon the floor
and upon the ground close around- the
place. Hanc them ! yes hang them !
went up the cry and wafted . its way in
the air that surrounded theni... t The
doomed men's arms were pionioned,
ropes were placed around their necks.
The victims felt and knew- what . >, it
meant. One fell upon his knees arid
plead in Spanish to save his life. Upon
his knees he raised his head in \ plain;
tive appeal toward heaven to the God of
Eternity for aid. He begged for his life
and protested his innocence,' he said he
was free from any crime of evil doing
whatever. Some with hearts of mercy
turned their eyes from off the pleading
man, for they in their hearts believed
he was really innocent. '. The majority
were obstinate. The doomed man cried
out in Spanish for a confessor. 'But
no priestly garbed confessor came to
minister to his spirital appeal. He was
told in Spanish no confessor was near,
he must prepare to meet his fate. r The
other man, hardened in crime— inriured
in blood of his victims,' held a stoical
look in demeanor and aotion. " % Two
hundred yards up the creek " from the
place of the massacre stood a great
water oak— green, strong nad thrifty in
its life. Forcing the two men into a
wagon drawn by two mules, the doomed
men were hauled under a great limb
that stood out at right angles from the
tree, the wagon was brought to a stand
still. The ropes already upon their
necks, one end of which was now
thrown over the limbs and drawn taut
around it. Upon the notification that
the ropes were securely fastened— a
thunderous burst of applause from the
crowd rent the air. The man that drove
the . mules drove out from under the
doomed men and left them to dangle and
strangle to death before the gaping
crowd. A few short moments elapsed
only when the inanimate bodies of the
two men swung gentiy in oscillation in
the wind. The denouncement of all
this tragedy hung there in its appalling
sense of mortal justice. The tree itself
as if strickend by some almighty force
withered and died the following year,
and many a man with suspicious awe
attributed its death to the hanging upon
it of one innocent man.

MORE ABOUT THE
PADGET AFFAIR
The Sacramento Bee recently pub
lished the particulars of sheriff Greg
ory's recent trip to Texas, substantially
the same as was detailed in, the Ledger
after the officer had got back from 'his
journey. The Placervllle Nugget of
last week publishes the Bee's article in
full, and adds the following to round up
the story: ' '■"/',',■
Sheriff Gregory evidently ex'pectf, the
public to pass him a nice boqiiet of
liberal proportions on the strength of
the foregoing little story. And he
would be entitled to it. too, if there was
nothing else to the narrative. But un
fortunately for the boquet, and also for
the sheriff of Amador, there remains
much history in conection with Padgct's
career which the Bee omitted. In re
gard to the selling of burros to the rail
road company at fancy prices, that was
an arrangement between Padgct's em
ployer and himself, and they worked it
to their mutual advantage until it ceased
to be profitable. When Padget located
In Nashville," El Dorado county, he
undertook to run his saloon in his own
way, but the half breeds of that section
considered this an infringement of their
rights,' and called on Padget one evening
for the purpose of "running him off the
ranch." The ringleader. was killed in
the fi s ht. Padget left for Alaska, and
upon his arrival there took • the
name of Knowles. He acquired valu
able mining property. An old acquain
tance happened along one day and ac
costed him as Padget, and the ■':. latter
confessed the situation to the supposed
friend. The friend turned his' know
ledge to advantage by taking over a half
interest in all Padget's mining property
for keeping still. They came out to
gether, with the understanding that they
were to return to Alaska together. Pad
get went to Texas to. clear up his' record
there, and the "friend" saw a pros
pective chance to do him out of all his
valuable Alaska property. When the
Texas charge against Padget was dis
missed, those who started out to "do"
him resorted to an attempt to have the El
Dorado officers take up the killing of the
half breed in Nashville. Sheriff Cook
was telegraphed to and he did not even
consider the matter of sufficient* irhp'or';
tance to answer the telegram. The con
spirators then enlisted the services of
the Amador county official, and he is
certainly entitled to some sort , of re
cognition for the way in which he took
the bait. We hope he got well paid for
his part of the work. What a nice thing
it would be for somebody if Padget
could be railroaded to the penitentiary
either in Texas, California or anywhere
else, while others exploit his Alaskan
mining claims, from which it is alleged
$300,000 in gold dust has already been
taken, and the grass roots hardly dis
turbed. The Bee and Sheriff Gregory
should finish up the history they started
with such a flourish. ■ w ;f; f

Impossible to be Well
It is impossible to be well, simply impossible, if the
bowels are constipated. You must pay attention to the
laws of nature, or suffer the consequences. Undigested
material, waste products, poisonous substances,, must be
removed from the body at least once each day, or there
will be trouble. A sluggish liver is responsible for an
immense amount of suffering and serious disease. Ask
your doctor about Ayer's Pills. He knows why they act
directly on the liver. Trust him. j.c.A V trCo..LowtU,Mass.
MINING NOTES
Cooper.— This quartz mine is located
near Oleta, and has been idle for a
number of years. Several companies
have taken hold of it at different times,
but never developed or proved it to any
depth. Recently a j new company has
commenced operations looking to Its
development, and it is the hope of the
people of that section that work will be
pushed ahead in a systematic and busi
ness-like way. There is no reason why
there should not be paying quartz ledges
in this district, which was the scene of
rich placer diggings in early days.
Mitchell.— At this Pine Grove quartz
mine the company that, has undertaken
to develop it is working away, but the
weather conditions will not permit of the
erection of machinery. An air compres
sor has been ordered, but the conditions
of the roads will prevent the heavy
machinery being hauled to Its destina
tion until spring. In the meantime the
saw mill is kept running, cutting
lumber for the necessary buildings. A
boarding house is under way.and will be
completed before long. About six men
are working. It is the intention to in
stall machine drills and other labor sav
ing contrivances, so as to reduce the
cost of mining to the minimum. There
is said to be a big -body of low grade
ore, and by the introduction of up-to
date methods it is believed this ore can
be made to yield a profit.
Argonaut— The ledge encountered at
the 3100 level shows, up, remarkably
strong, and of excellent quality.' It is
K> feet wide, and in gold bearing
quality Is fully up to the high standard of
the ore bodies heretofore .encountered
in the levels above. Such- an immense
ledge at this depth gives great en
couragement to the stockholders, hold
ing out the promise 'of a long era of
dividends. The opening up of .a new
level at the depth of 3300 feet is ' being
prosecuted with all possible speed.
Bunker Hill— The main ore body
recently encountered on the 1750 level
running north proves to be of large
dimensions and of' excellent grade. It
is 9 feet wide, all of good milling
character, with a streak of very high
grade running through it, similar to
that met with above. This extra grade
rock is used for salting purposes, so as
to maintain the average monthly output
as near as possible, -more or less of it
being sent to the mill according to the
grade of the bulk of the ore milled
during the month. As soon as the ore
body was cut on the 1750 level, a crew
was put to work drifting toward the
ledge at the 1950 level. It will take in
the neighborhood of three months to
reach the ledge at this point, as it is
several hundred feet distant from the
shaft. It is hoped to reach the ore
body early in the spring, which will
give ample time to make the addition of
20 stamps to the mill during the
summer months in case the ledge
proves satisfactory at this depth, which
there is every reason to believe it will
from present indications.
Green's Saloon
Changes Hands
. Virgilio Belluomini and Andrew Mar
cucci last Wednesday negotiated the
purchase of the saloon of W. O. Green
on Main street. A bargain was made,
the price paid being variously stated at
from 82500 to $4000. The sale includes
only. the business, stock and liquors,
furniture, etc. The new owners will
take possession as soon as the necessary
preliminary arrangements are completed.
Belluomini recently returned to this
county from Oakland. He went there
nearly a year ago, and started in busi
ness there. But not satisfied with con
ditions there, he concluded to return to
the home of boyhood. The price paid
for the saloon is considered steep, but
they were determined to get into that
business in a central position, and Mr
Green, who was not anxious to sell, told
them he would give way if he got his
price. _.^^_,

Inspecting; the
Limestone^ Deposits.
A movement is on foot to organize a
company for the development of the vast
deposits of limestone that exist in the
neighborhood of Mount Echo, between
Suttcr Creek and lone., The old Bon
ham lime kiln, which has furnished the
bulk of the lime for the whole of Ama
dor county, has been in operation since
the early sOs, and is working still,
furnishing the lime to, the different
towns along the mineral belt as well as
the valley section. A party of five in
terested persons left Jackson on Sunday
last and took the train at Martcll. for the
purpose of personally inspecting the
limestone ledges, and the feasibility of
marketing the product. They were VC\
H. Greenhalgh, who has been working
on this proposition for over a year, G.
W. Brown, A. Ginocchio, R. .Vl'ebb,.
and J. McPherson of the A.ni.dor Cen
tral Railroad. They proceeded by rail to
the big bend below the Mountain Spring
house, and from thence proceeded on
foot over the hills and across Sutter
creek to the limestone district. They
were met at Sutter creek by Mr Geb- '
hardt, the present owner of the Bonham
place, with a wagon, which conveyed
the party across the creek. They
traveled over the Henderson, Bonham and -
Sibole lands, where the bulk of th,s.
limestone formation outcrops at vari
ous places. At the Gebhardt kiln they
were met by J. Newman of lone, who
is also interested in promoting the en
terprise, and Mr McClelland, who has
charge of the Coppermine, and who
came to give an : idea of the, cost of ex
tracting the .rock s from^the. different
points'.-"*"""
The visitors were fully satisfied con
cerning the quantity of lime rock, and
as regards quality it has been submitted
to expert analysis, .and pronounced to be
equal to the best,, being within five per
cent pure. The deposit most available
to the nearest point on the Amador Cen
tral has never been prospected, as to ex
tent and quality. Those interested will
at once proceed to open up a quarry at
this point for the purpose of satisfying
themsevles on these matters. Should
everything turns out favorable, it is the
intention to organize a company to open
up the quarry and secure the necessary
transportation facilities to place this
product on the market.  It promises to
develop into a big enterprise,! as there
is a growing' demand for limestone, as.
well as for the manufactured lime. The
main difficulty now is the cost of trans
portation. Hauling by teams from the
quarry to the railroad at lone' is im
practicable, the cost being too heavy to
permit of any margin of profit. John

Meeting of Stock
men's Association
The Amador and El "Dorado Cattle
men's Association met in Jackson last
Monday, January 25. \PhHe nearly all
the cattlemen of Amador county were
present or represented at the gathering,
there were few from El Dorado county,
the state of the weather and the bad con
dition of the roads rendering inexpedient
for them to travel. E. W. Kelley, chier
ranger of the Tahoe forest reserve, was
present. He addressed the members,
speaking of the advantages of having an
association ofj this characte'r,\ with its
advisory board, and many other features
of benefit to stockmen grazing within
the limits of the reserve. "*'■' '
Officers for the ensuing term were all
reelected, as follows:
C. L. Culbert, chairman.

A NOVEL BOYCOTT.
The latest boycott scheme is to abstain from eating meat
so as to bring down the price of beef, which it is claimed is
kept up to an exorbitant figure. The promoters propose "to
abstain from eating beef until the ' conditions are changed
more in accordance with their views. The craze over the
trust problem is responsible for this movemeut. It is con
tended that the beef trust has brought about the high prices,
So the crj' of "Down with the trusts,'' has been taken up by
the housewives in the eastern states, and the discredited boy
cott has been adopted as the most potent weapon to ac
complish this end. There can be no question that meat is
outrageously high. For that|matter, so is everthing else in
the shape of foodstuffs.^The people have to find a scapegoat
for this condition of things,|and the* combinations commonly
designated trusts have]the blame saddled upon them. Per
haps they are responsible in a measure." We do not believe
they are wholly to blame, nor even mainly. In this age of
big undertakings we cannot get along, and keep pace witli
the march of progress, without vast combinations of capital.
We speak of these so-called trusts as something apart from
and hostile to the masses of the people. As a matter of fact,
the money with which these^big enterprises sre inaugurated
and carried on comes largely from people of small capital
comparatively. The people invest, their savings in the bonds
and stocks of these coucerns,*and in the absence of this in
vestment they could not be conducted. It is true, that a few
money magnates reap the lion's share of the benefit, but that
will apply to almost every department of business. The
boycott is a very poor remedy for any evil. Indeed, in its'
spirit and demoralizing effects it is infinitely worse than the
evil it is intended to cure. As a matter ■of fact, it never
cured or lessened any evil. It* will fail in this new sphere of
anticipated usefulness. The contracted demand for meat for
a brief time may disturb the stock market, and cause a
temporary lowering of prices. Soon the boycott conspiracy
will fall to pieces from its own inherent weakness, and the
meat business will relapse into the old groove. We say this
without excusing the existing extravagant prices. Meat has
not advanced in price in greater ratio than other com
modities. Labor has been boosted to much higher figures
than prevailed a decade ago, and this result is not altogether
due to the agitation of labor organizations, Of course, with
increased pay for labor — which is the main factor of expense
in the production of all articles of commerce — there has
naturally been a corresponding [advauce all along the line.
It is a mistake to imagine that any material increase in' the
price of labor can be gained without affecting the price of the
products of labor. It is more than probable that the
enormously increased production of gold within the last half
century has more to do with the jump in prices generally
than all other canses combined. We are apt to speak of
gold as the most stable thing known in valu'i. An ounc.2 of
gold represents as many dollars to-day as it did twenty years
ago. 'It is the world's accepted standard of value. But not
withstanding this it is subject to the sains fluctations uuder
the law of supply and demaud as any other commodity.
Gold cheapness is exemplified in the price of all other articles
soaring skywirX Ths purchasing power of gold is lessened,
and that am ).uu.s to the s^ne thing practically as a falling
off in the va'.uj of gold.
The bounty on coyote and other scalps cost Siskiyou
county in the neighborhood of $iooo last month. Amador,
considering its much smaller territory, will; not lag far bs
hind this record, when the bounty business gets in good
working shape. It is a uoteworthy fact that this head
bounty on predatory animals has b^:i revived not for the
protection of small farmers, for the small farms have taen
gobbled up at an alarming rate of late years by the cattle
raisers, who roam their herds over vast areas which ought to
be the homes of hundreds of prosperous families.

Th« Great Musician's First Important
Engagement In Paris.
I'adcrewskl's first really Important
engagement as a, pianist was in Paris,
lie was engaged to play In the draw
ing room of a. lady famous for her niu
picales, and his fee, which seemed to
him enormous, was $20. He managed
to persuade the humane ngent to pay
him in advance, and when Paderew
skl had redeemed lilh dress suit from
pawn nml paid for shoes, gloves, tie
and other essentials he had no money
left for cab hire, so he was forced to
walk to the scene of his engagement.
The music loving audience inspired
him. lie played with feeling, passion
and mastery of his instrument us nev
er before. Ills success was instant
and unmistakable. The poor player
had suddenly become the lion of the
hour, his dream had become a reality,
and fame and fortune were assured
him. ■ •';!
At last after disengaging himself
from his admirers he turned to leave,
when Ills hostess, remembering with
regret, the' smallness of the fee for so
marvelous n performance, offered him
her carriage for his return home. But
Pnderewskl'i pride came to the rescue.
In his 'courteous yet reserved way he
made ;i formal how. and. saying, "Xo,

homeward.— Pearson's Weekly.

Fooled the Town.
University students have long enjoy
ed a reputation as practical jokers, but
there has been nothing quite so suc
cessful as the famous sultan of Zan
zibar hoax of some years ago at Cam
bridge. One day the mayor of the
town received the following wire from
one Henry Lucas, Hotel Cecil. London:
"The sultan of Zanzibar will arrive at
Cambridge at 4:27 for a short visit.
Could you arrange to show him build
ings of interest and send carriage?"
The mayor rose to the occasion, and
in due course four dark complcxloned
gentlemen with turbans and volum.i
nous trousers arrived at Cambridge.
The mayor and corporation entertain
ed them right royally, but to their
chagrin t!;ey discovered a few hours
later that the interesting orientals
were simply a quartet of undergrad
uates who had played an immense
practical joke upon the town.— London

The meeting was called for the purpose
of settling disputes regarding range

J. C. Del Ortoand L. B. Joses; David
Filippin! and David Motley Jr.; J. F.

Louis Malaspina and T. D. Mltchel.
The decision of the Board was that In
all cases but Matley and Filippinl the
range now used by the parties be used
Jointly. In the case of Matley and
Filippini' it was decided that the
boundary line of their ranges should be
the top of the summit ridge, each
party to range to the top of the ridge on
the respective sides.— Prospect.

There is a petition being ciculated to
have the supervisors remove certain
gates and make a public road across a
piece of the McLaughlin Co. land lead
ing from the county road in Calaveras
to the county road in San Joaquin and
■ Amador county. Removing these gates
would be a great convenience to the
public but would be of still greater
benefit to Wallace, as there are several
ranchers across the river in Amador
county who would trade there more than
they do if the gates were removed. This
particular piece of land that the gates
were on the past few years the gates
hve been removed and an ODen road
made and fenced. Where the gates are
now located is on the railroad land where
there have been no gates, at least during
the past ten years. If a spirit of give
and take had been observed in this
neighborhood it seems to us that this
trouble could have been settled some
time ago. — Prospect.

In the rear portion of C. V. Miller's
store there is a. small trap door covering
an opening through which refuse was
thrown into the creek. The trap on last
Sunday. night was not fastened down,
and in consequence some youth tried
his hand at burglary. Entering the store
through the trap door the burglar found
in the. office "a tin cash box, which he
pried open and took therefrom a purse
containing about $10 in almuiiiiim mer
chandise checks— lo, 25 and 50 cents.
The cash register, located hi the front
part of the store, and containing a
couple of dollars in change, was not
disturbed, the thief being apparently
satisfied with the well filled purse,
which he presumably believed contained
silver coins. Quite early the following
morning a small boy appeared at the
store and wanted to sell Miller a quan
tity of metal merchandise checks. At
the same time he not knowing of his
loss, declined to barter with the lad,
who stated in reply to a query, that he
had found them. Later other boys came
in, Miller in the meantime having dis
covered his loss. The boys all told the
same story, they had noted the bright
aluminum checks in the creek bottom,
•and fished them out. Investigation was
made and the conclusion reached that
the burglar upon investigating the con
tents of the purse and discovering what
he had, dumpefl* the checks into the
creek. --Angels Record,

Moving Pictures of Crime
Pass from the City to
the Country.
Although the agitation against present
ing moving pictures of crime to the
view of children has had somexffect on
the nickelodeons in the city, the small
towns of the state are not so fortunate.
Pictures discarded here are often taken
through the country, where the. in
frequency of moving pictures shows as
sures immunity from interference and
good patronage, provided the exhibition
is not a flagrant offense against decency.
Little children goto such shows, and
for days afterwards they 'talk excitedly
of the thefts and murders that were im
pressed upon the minds by an invention
which, when properly used, is a great
aid to the work of the schools.
A clever San Francisco woman
speaks of the evil of such exhibitions :
"A set of pictures showing a criminal
act has the same effect as a cheap novel
dealing with that class of stories. - The
impression created is perhaps deeper
because of the realistic manner in which
it is presented. Scenes of hold-ups,
murders, and crimes generally, and
those pictures which depict the vicious
forms of life are undesirable to flaunt
before the eves and minds of children.
The manufacturers are the ones respon
sible for the class of pictures shown
more than the operators of shows."
To what lengths the manufacturers
will go was made plain the other day
when the French government seized
films reproducing the official guillotin
ing of the murderer of a child, as
France makes most of the moving
pictures used by the nickelodeons of the
United States that seizure prevented a
ghastly addition to the supply of
"shockers."
Among other pictures that should be
suppressed' are those in which the
domestic virtures are derided. Other
wise the moral teachings of the home
and the schools will to a great extent be
offset by the nickelodeons. The surest
way to bring about the necessary reform
is for parents, by withdrawing the patro
nage of their famiiles, to make offen
sive moving picture shows unprofitable.

Profiting by Others.
"Some persons have the knack of
deriving a comfortable living from the
energy of others, while they dodge
hard work themselves- By this I 'i do
not mean that they practice fraud, but
simply that they know how to use their
wits legitimately, " said a well-known
San Francisco lawyer, who is a keen
observer.
"I saw a practical illustration of this
on the water front several days ago," he
continued. "Two negro boys were sell
ing peanuts, each having charge of a
large basket. Ons was a bundle of
energy and kept up an endless 'spiel' as
he rushed hither and thither in quest of
customers.
'"Here you go, here!' he would shot.
' Red hot peanuts, fi' cents a bag. On'y
fl' cents a bag, here! Red hot peanuts!
Here you go, here!' •'
. The other chap, comfortablyensconsed
on a box, would wait until the first one
had to pause to catch his breath, when
he would chip in with a monotonous
singsong :
"'Heahtoo, heah, too!'"— San Fran-

Census Enumerators'.
Rates of Pay.
Washington, January 22, 1010.
The varying wage scales in different
parts of the country and the differences
in the nature and extent .of the local
difficulties confronting the enumerators
in the larger geographical divisions of
the United States have influenced and
guided United States census director
Durand in the adoption of a classifica
tion of enumerators' rates of compensa
tion, within the limits prescribed by the
United States census law enacted by
congress.
The different classes of rates will be
so applied that in general the average
enumerator will earn substantially the
same actual amount In one district as in
another, even though the population may
be much sparser in one than in the
other, with other conditions also
different. Regard is paid to the fact
that prevailing wages and salaries are
hieher in some parts of the country than
in others, but, aside from this, the
director's aim is to adjust the rates so
as to make the earnings of enumerators
substantially uniform. When the per
capita rates would not give sufficient
pay, the per diem rates are prescribed
The rates in general will be so adjusted
as to give a slightly higher average
amount to the enumerators than they
received in 11)00.
. Per diem rates of pay will be paid to
the census enumerators in the sparsely
settled rural districts of Arizona, . Cali
fonia, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Texas,
Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. .
The rate will range from $5 to $(> per
day for the enumeration of the rural
areas outside of cities and towns. Six
dollars is the highest rate authorized .-by
law.
The directors realises that in many
districts of the far west it will be im
possible to secure competent men to act
as enumerators at a rate of compensation
less than that being paid for ordinary
classes of work in the same area. Were
enumerators in such districts paid only
on the per capita basis, their compensa
tion would be unreasonably low.
The enumerators in the thinly in
habited country sections of North
Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and
Kansas also will be compensated on a
per diem basis. Certain difficult or
sparsely settled enumeration districts
in other states will be included among
those to which the per diem rates will
apply, as the conditions of the enumer
ators will be such that an enumerator
could not make fair earnings at any of
the per capita rates established.
This announcement was made by cen
sus director Durand to-day, in order to
conteract the deterrent effect upon ap
plications for enumerators' places in
the far west and southwest states of the
widely circulated and erroneous state
ment that per capita rates of pay were to
be given in the sparsely populated
regions named.
The Classification of Rates.
In this connection the director has is
sued to the census supervisors a de
tailed statement of the classification of
rates adoDted for the compensation of
enumerators in the thirteenth census,
commencing April 15 next.
There are three general rates— the per
capita, the mixed, and the per diem.
The first and second general rates have
five subdivisions each.
The per diem rates range from $3 to
$5.50, $4, $4.50, 85, $5.50, and $G, and
are to be paid for a day of eight hours'
work.

The New Democratic Paper.
Senator Camlnetti, at the meeting of
democrats held in San Francisco last
week, presented a report in behalf of
the press committee in regard to steps
taken for the organization of the demo
cratic press company and the plans for
the publication in San Francisco of a
Democratic newspaper to be known as
the San Francisco Sun. He stated that
machinery had been ordered, that a loca
tion had been secured and that although
the time of beginning publication had
ben postponed for a short time, the
paper would make its appearance as
soon as possible. He also said that
plans had been made for keeping a
special representative at Sacramento and
furnishing v special news service to all
the democratic papers in the interior of
the state.— Sonora Independent.

The Cowboy
And the Bishop.
Have you ever heard the slory of a
certain missionary hishoo in the far
west and the cowboy? Well, it is by no
means new, but so good it will bear re
peating. The bishop preached on Sun
day, to a scattered handful of frontier
settlers, a powerful sermon on the
prodigal son. Away in the back of the
hall he saw a cowboy listening with rapt
attention to the words that fell from his
lips, so when the services were over
and he went down to speak to the
various members of his congregation, as
his custom was, he sought out the cow
boy and, as he grasced him by the hand,
he said "My son, I noticed that you
were interested in the sermon. I hope
you understand the great lesson of for
giveness taught us by the parable.
Now, if you have any erring sons won't
you treat them in the same Christian
The cowboy looked puzzled , for a
minute, then his eyes twinkled.
"Wai." he drawled, "it's this-a-way:
If I'd a been the man in the story, I'd a
raised the calf and thrashed the boy."
A good many people in this world be
sides the prodigal son have needed cor
rection badly enough ; but the trouble
is, we do not always get all we deserve,
even the best of us ; and as for the
worst— well, it is mighty lucky for them
that they get let off as easy as they do*
Now, there is no meaner character on
earth than a thief. A man who takes
what doesn't belong to him is justly
dcsDised by all decent people. Now
isn't the substitutor such a man?
Doesn't he make his living by stealing
the reputation of well-known articles for
his own inferior goods?
No sooner has a manufacturer built up
a big reputation by extensive advertising
and by the constant high quality of his
goods, than the substitutor stands ready
to take advantage of his success. Per
haps the entire expense of the advertised
artcle is due to the fine quality and
pureness of the materials of which it is
composed. In this case the substitutor
makes something that has about the
same appearance as the original. The
substitute is nearly always compounded
of adulterated ingredients. If it is a
soap, a lotion, cold cream or anything
like that, it is positively dangerous, and
you ought not touch it at any price, for
a substance that is used on the skin
should be absolutely pure, or it will
bring a host of distressing ailments in
its train.
Ask for the genuine advertised article,
and make sure that you get it.
Chrysanthemums.
Chrysanthemums stand fourth in
commercial importance among flowers.
Only the rose, the violet and the car
nation surpass them, and (bat chiefly
because (lie chrysanthemum season is
so short, while the others can be had

ChrysanthiMinitu means "golden flow

before I lit? big butter yellow globes

Strangely enough, the first chrysan

like an aster. Somebody took It to

The town ofSturgis, In Mississippi,
lsthe only round square town In ex
istence. | By .legal enactment the circle
has been squared, and the mathemati

''Section 1. Be it enacted by the

THE SETTING SUN.
When Vulcan Sailed It Round the
Ocean So It Could Rise Again.
The ancients had some queer theories
whereby they sought to explain the
rising and setting of the sun. They
thought tbe earth to be Hat and were
greatly puzzled to know how tbe same
sun which plunged Into tbe ocean at
a fabulous distance in the west could
reappear tbe next morning at an equal
ly great distance in the east. A num
ber of remarkable theories were ad
vanced, and every one of them was
wrong.
Mythologlsts of old asserted that
after the sun bad dipped in tbe west
ern ocean at sunset (the Iberians and
other ancient nations actually imagined
that they could hear the hissing of the
waters wben tbe glowing globe was
plunged therein) be was seized by Vul
can and placed In . a golden goblet.
This strange craft, with its astonishing
cargo, navigated the ocean by a north
erly course so as to reach tbe east
again in time for sunrise the follow
ing morning. ■
Among the more sober physicists of
old. as related by Aristotle, it was be
lieved that in some manner tbe sun
was conveyed by night across the
northern regions and that darkness
was due to mountains which screened
off the sunbeams duriug the voyage.
Anticipation.
Lieutenant . Shackletoii tells how
wheu In tlie antarctic wastes lie and
bis companions sustained their spirits
and their bodies as well when sup
plies had to be cut down to a mini
mum by dwelling upon the glorious
eating they would have on returning
to headquarters. The value of such
mental sustenance lias long been rec
ognized by up , to date commanders.
There was the German officer in the
war of IS7O wbo sustained the Mag
ging spirits aud weary legs of Ills men
by shouting: "There is a brewery in
side that town: Let. us get there be
fore anybody elsel" History relates
that the men did get there with re
markable speed. Equally shrewd was
that Japanese commander in the Man
churido war who. seeing Ills men ex
hausted with thirst and knowing full
well the wonderful properties of pickled
plums, cried out, "Two miles from here
there Is a. forest of plums.'* The an
ticipated plums went far to relieve
their parched mouths.
What West Point Does For Its Cadets.
What West Point does for its cadet*
is precisely this: It takes its youth at
the critical period of growth; it iso
lates them completely for tieurly four
years from the vicious influences that
corrupt young manhood and from the
atmosphere of commercialism; it pro
vides absorbing employment for botli
mental and physical activities; it sur
rounds them with exacting responsibil
ities, high standards and exalted tra
ditions of honor and integrity, and it
demands a rigid accountability for
every moment of their time and for
every voluntary action, it offers them
the inducements of an. honorable ca
reer and a sufficient competence as a
reward of success, and it has impera
tive authority for the enforcement of
Its conditions and restraints.— Colonel

THE NICHOLS' CASE
Defendant iFound Not Guilty
The trial of J. D. Nichols, charged
with rape upon Pearl aged 14,
was finished in the superior court early
Saturday morning, and resulted in a ver
dict of acquittal. The case terminated
much sooner than was anticipated. The
testimony of the defendant himself, in
which he denied all the material allega
tions of the complaint, closed the evi
dence. Friday afternoon A. Caminetti
commenced arguing the case from the
standpoint of the prosecution. Saturday
morning, after the -opening argument
was concluded, McGee, the defendant's
attorney, stated that he submitted the
matter without argument. Theis move o!
the defense shut off further argument en
the part of the prosecution, cut out the
closing by the district attorney. The
court thereupon instructed the mry as to
the law bearing on the case. The jury
then retired for deliberation. It did not
take lone to reach a verdict. They re
turned into court in less than half an
hour with a verdict of not guilty. Only
two ballots were taken, the first stood 1 1
to 1 In favor of acquittal, and the second
was unanimous for defendant. The de
fendant was at once discharged, and hi»
bondrmen exonerated.

by the ghosts of Russian exiles.

Invade the canny confines, and there
are few men In the far north, who have
the temerity to test the truth of the
many and weird tales told of this for
bMdiiig and barren island.
Shipmasters and sailors passing the
place assert that the agonizing cries of
Kusslan exiles sent there to starve or
die b.v torture are sometimes heard
on quiet nights, while the clink of
chains and the sound of blows are tes
tified to in an affidavit by a white man
who once attempted to remain there

As his only way to rest he would leave
the house In the middle of the night,
start up the pump and. lying down in
a nearby hammock, find sleep brought
him by the lullaby of the hot air en

What Yoomen Were.
Yeomen were formerly considered to
be by their title ou a level with es
quires, and they weio called yeomen
because, in addition to the weapons
proper for close engagements, they
fought in the wars with arrows anil a
bow which was made of yew; heuce
the word. After the conquest the
name of yeoman, iv reference to the
original oflice in war. was changed to
that of archer. The term, however,
was continued with additions— the yeo
man of the crown, of" the chamber,
yeoman usher, etc.— and we tiud that
considerable grants were bestowed on
socsl- of them. In thelegal view a
yeoman is defined to be one that has
fee land of the value of 40 shillings a
year and is thereby qualified to serve
ou juries, to vote for knights of the
shire and to do nu.v other net which
the law may require. The yeomen al

concerned the regulations or interests
of the kingdom, and their renown as
warriors is fully established b.v their
numerous heroic, achievements.—Lou

Insects and Flowers.
Experiments on showy Mowers like
the poppy tend to show that insects
are not always attracted to flowers by
the brightly colored petals, but rather
by the perception— doubtless by means
of smell-that there is honey or pollen.
Iv these experiments the unopened
flower bud is Inclosed In a gau/.e net
so as to protect It from insects, nnd
when It expands the petals are care
fully removed without touchlnji the re

FRAUD ORDERS.
Th« Way Our Poitoffice Insptetert
'Protect the Public.
' When R person or firm that Is nn«
known to the postofllce Inspectors be
gins to receive large quantities of let
ters the inspectors begin to Investi
gate. They visit the office of the con
cern and learn what they can. If It Is
a legitimate nnd honest business It Is
not Interfered with. But If It looks
"shady," If It happens to be a mining
or land scheme that offers large re
turns upon the Investment of money,
the Inspectors abstract a do7.cn or so
of the Incoming letters from the mull,
get the names nnd addresses of the
writers and then reseal the letters and
permit them to be delivered.
The next move for the Inspectors Is
to visit tho persons whose names nnd
nddresses wero taken from the letters
and to got from them the correspond
once of the supposed fraudulent con
cern. With this the. Inspectors "make"
a case and either cause the arrest of
the dishonest persons or cause a
"fraud order" to be Issued against It.
A "fraud order" Is simply an order
made by the postal authorities nt
Washington declaring that such a
business Is fraudulent and warning
the public against sending money to
It. After "that each letter coming n»l
dresxed to that concern is stamped
"fraud" In red Ink across Its face and
returned to the sender.

ROQUEFORT CHEESE.
The Discovery Made by a Poor French
Peasant Boy.
A shepherd boy with a poor appe
tite discovered the secret of making
Itoquefort cheese. True as gospel!
They swear by that story today in
Itoquefort. France, and if they only
knew the lad's name they'd raise a
monument to him. lie was out tend
ing sueep. and. the sun smiting down
hard, he went Into » cavern to eat his
cheese and rye bread. He failed to gei
away with all of it and threw a hunk
of the cheese off to one side. It hap
pened to drop on v natural shelf, and
a few months later the boy found
the cheese still there. He saw that li
had undergone a constitutional change,
for instead of being dry aud hard it
•was moist ami creamy. Besides, there
were veiiis of greenish mold running
through It. Tbe boy took a nip. and
the taste was so pleasing he carried ii
crumb home to his mother. She must
have been a woman of intelligence,
for no sooner bad she tasted than sue
took one of the largest rolls of cheese
from her dairy, had her sou guide her
to the cavern and placed it ou the
shelf. In <lue time the same change
was wrought, and Roquefort cheese
had arrived as an article of com
merce. All the natural caverns around
the quaint old town now are used for
ripening cheese, and the women work
in them with small oil lamps strapped
around their chests.— New York Press.

Amador County
Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises nn area of
648 square miles. It lies on the wes
tern slope of Sierra Novade mountain*,
and emoraces within It? territory all
the diversity of valley, foothill, and
high mountainous lands.'
Climate.— The climate of the popu
lous portions of the county In as genial
and healthful as can be found anywhere
In California As climate Is one of the
most valuable assets of this favored
state in attracting population, Amador
stands second to no county in this) re
gard. It should, and no doubt will In
time, when its climatic advantages are
more thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, become a health resort not
only for those in less favored states,
but for the residents of other parts of
California. The temperature alone the
central portion ' rarely falls below 30
degrees above zero in winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees id the sum
mer. Snow seldom falls in the settled
districts, and never remains on the
p round for more than a few hours. Of
course, In the high mountain regions
of eastern Amador the snowfall Is very
heavy — which is characteristic of the
entire Sierra Nevuda range. The sum
mer season is alway accompanied with
cool nights; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs are rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
infrequent.
Gold Mining. — The county, although
rich in other sources or wealth, com
paratively untouched, is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. The
deepest gold mines in America tire lo
cated here. The Kennedy mine is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
3000 feet below the surface, with every
indication that the pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold, the county has contrib
uted fully $100,000000 to the world's
supply of the precious metal. The
mines are still yielding at the rate of
about two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
eight or ten mines operating- on what
is called the "mother lode," stretching
clear across the county in a north-east
erly direction a distance of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate between
400 and 500 stamps, ami furnish em
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
industry is still in its infancy. The
unexplored territory, even along the
main gold belt, is far in excess of tho
ground that has actually been worked
or prospected : • The county offers to
day one of the most inviting fields to
be found anywhere in the world for the
investment of capital in the fascinating
business of gold mining, not alono along
the mother lode, but also in the almost
untouched mineralized country <>t the
east belt, some tenor twelve miles from
the main lode.
Besides gold,' we have copper, de
Dosits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
limestone, granite, and soapstone or
talc — all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities. — The agri
cultural possibilities equal, If not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce anything that cun be
grown in the most favored sections.
In the foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetable are raised where irrigation
is practicable along the numerous water
courses. Further up in the mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet, the
soil is admirably adapted for apples
and potatoes. A ready market for
many times the quantity now raised of
these commodities can be found in the
various mining towns.
Grape culture and wlnoinakiny: are
becoming important industries, both
the grapes and wine commanding a
better price than the product of the
lowland.
Land Is cheap compared with other
California lands. Improved furm£ may
be secured for one-fourth the price
current in some places. Unimproved
lands can be had from $5 to $10 per
acre. It does not require a fortune to
buy a small ranch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agnculurul pop
ulation. Vast tracts now devoted to
cattle ranges might be made the homes
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amador has a population of less than
12000. Three fourths of this is concen
trated in a strip of three miles above
and below the mineral belt.
Jackson, the county seat, has about
2500 inhabitants, and lsan Incorporated
city ot the sixth class. Other towns
are Sutter Creek, Amador City, Dry
town, Plymouth, Volcano, Pine Grove
and Oleta. lone City is the metropolis
of the valley section, a thriving town
of 1000 Inhabitants.
Thecommunlty Is law abiding. Edu
cational facilities are excellent. \\ A
schoolhouse is within easy reauh of
nearly every family. Thore Is ono high
school, located at lone.
The assessment roll for 1000 Is $-5.—
800, 793, and the tax rate for both state
and county purposes $2 on the $100.
The Southern I'ueilie has a branch
railroad running to lone. From this
point the lone and Eastern railroad ex
tends 14 miles further to the miolnyi
section.

Bulletin : Chariey Hawk's hens laid
II f teen eggs yesterday.
Women's schemes, like women's
iokes, seldom amount to much.
We never get much excited about a
boy wanderer; he usually outgrows it.
It frequently happens that the clever
storyteller wastes a lot of time.
It may be said of the under dog.
however, that he sometimes starts the
tight.
The gentleman never spends much
time in announcing that he is a gentle
man.
It would be nice if a live nian could
have as manv friends as every dead man
has.
Occassionally, a boy goes to college,
and seems to learn nothing more than
not to work.
Another story we have little conti
dence in : That a woman passed for a
n-.an 35 years.
You may need a lawyer occasionally,
but a more general need is to keep away
from them.
The man who talks so much his cigar
is alwavs going out, might as well quit
smoking. »
Tim Murnane : There are two things
all American : one the old flag, and
one's baseball.
A boy's idea of a worthless dog is one
which received its training at the hands
of a woman.
A woman's idea of extravagance is to
buy a dollar's worth of postage stamps
at one time. • ,
As much as the children like mother,
thev never approve of her great patience
with father.
Since Adam started it, the fashion of
blaming one's mistakes on others has
hung on pretty well.
A boy's curiosity is aroused by a re
frigerator, the same as a girl's is
aroused by bureau drawers.
The difficulty of applying neatness to
the process of chewing tobacco probably
never will be overcome.
We never get much excited when an
actor sings of the great virtue of Ameri
cans ; actors brag a good deul.
We are not greatly impressed with the
wisdom of statesmen. None of them
seem to know how to reduce taxes.
One of the most expensive habits a
man can get into is the habit of not be
ing a gentleman. And it is a habit
easily acquired.
Some men are crazy to leave a lot of
monev to their children, while other
men say: "Let my children hustle . for
themselves, as I did.
We have many foolish ways, but we
have never been indignant because of
the heartless manner in which the
government treats the Indians. ..... .
The trouble with the girl who powders
is that she soon forgets she 'is engaged
in a retail business, and branches out
into the wholesale.
Considering that they are wiping on
new towels, wearing new shoes, and
cooking in new frying pans, young
i married couples get along pretty well.
So much attention is paid the college
yell as to create the impression that
students are being trained to earn a liv
ing after graduation by calling the cattle
home.
So far as we have been able to find
out, the only advantage in wearing false
pulfs and braids is that a woman can
wash her hair these davs without getting
her head wet.
When a man has trouble with his
stomach, it is due to one of two causes :
Either his wife is such a good cook she
is stuffing him, or she is such a poor
cook she is starving him.
Here is a new way to reach distinc
tion : To have hair that is hard to match
at the stores. This is a greater mark
of distinction these days than to have a
disease that "puzzles" the doctors.
How many hairpins does a woman use
when doing her hair? The hairpin
editor of The Globe has investigated,
and makes this report: She uses just is
many as she has. I 1 she has only two
hairpins, she makes her hair stay up
with two. but if she finds twenty in the
top bureau drawer, she uses all of them.
All our life, we have lived where
loafing Indians were common, and al
ways thought this a great joke : An In
dian woulJ call on a white man, «and ask
him for a letter of recommendation,
which the Indian wanted to present in
his begging trips. So the white man
would write a letter something, like this:
"The bearer of this, an Indian, is per
sonallv known to me 0.8 a thief. As soon I
us he comes into your yard, unchain the |
dogs." And the Indian, not being able
to read, would present the letter to
people with the greatest confidence.
Every man has been longing for a
young woman worth 110,000,000 to lay
her affection and fortune at his feet,
and coax him to run away with her.
(The men may deny it, but we hope we
know the me;i, having been one a good
many years.) Well, a Philadelphia
heiress worth $10,000,000 coaxed a man
to run away with her. Were they happy?
They were not. In fact, they became
dissatisticd with each other in a few
weeks, and permitted themselves to be
discovered. And the heiress in this case
wus named Roberta! So it seems that
whatever happens to us, we are not
haprv.

A new French motor combines the
steam turbine, the gas-engine and the
hot-air engine. The continuous rotary
motion of the turbine us much
less wasteful of energy than the recipro
cating motion of piston engines, but
attempts to utilize in turbines the great
advantages of power from gas explosion
have not been successfnl. The new
machine is made to operate steadily and
economically through simple gas com
bustion. The turbine of ordinary type
and working well at GOO deg. to 703 deg.
C/i is of special nickel, vanadium or
tungsten steel, and has a novel feature
in a compressor on the same axle, that
sends into the gas-generator a current
of air at a pressure of several, atmos
pheres. Heavy petrol oil sprayed into
the generator is burned in the current of
air heated to 1800 deg. C. The great
volumne of gas produced gives sufficient
pressure to drive the turbine, but as
the heat is too great, the excess is used
partly for heating the air previous to
combustion and partly to vaporize water
injected into the gases. To resist the
high temperatures, the gas receptacle is
of metal lined with carborundum. The
heat is fully utilized, and an odd mix
ture of air, carbonic^ acid and super
heated steam turns the turbine.
The tracK of smooth water, or "keel
water," stretching in the wake of a
moving vessel is often noticed, but little
understood. The effect is not due to
the influence of oil on surface tension,
through the stilling of the waves may be
similar. Prof. Ahlhorn, a German in
vestigator, has made some experiments
with bodies moved on the water., and
these show that the gyroscopic action of
the eddies or whirls left behind on each
side of the vessel smooth out the
smaller waves and give the calm, oily
appearing track that is so familiar. The
larger and swifter the ship the longer
and broader is 'the smooth. wake.;.. I

Areas of ' earthquake and Volcanic
activity are traxeilng westward about 25
miles a vcar, according to the investiea
tion of H. Wehner, a German physicist.
He accounts for this by the novel theory
that the earth's soild" crust encloses a
thin layer of liquid, within which is a
solid nucleus rotating about the same
axis as the outer Fhell. and in the same
direction but with a slightly less velo
city, the lagging behind causing the
nucleus to make a revolution to the west
in the crust in about 592 years. - It is
assumed that earthquake and volcanic
disturbances result when projecting or
active spots on the nucleus are moves
under weak portions of the crust. From
reports by ships during the last 60 years,
it is calculated that the active spots of
the Atlantic are nearly all collected at
the present time under the region
tween 35 deg. and 41 deg. west longi
tude and 1 deg. north and 1 deg. south
latitude, and that this- area off the
northeastern coast of South America
may be regarded as a danger zone.
That the soil possibilities of Palestine
and California are much the same is
quite a revelation. Prof. A. Aaron
sohn, of Haifa, Palestine, has -pointed
out that each region has a range of low
mountains near the coast, and beyond
this a long interior valley with a range
of higher mountains for the eastern
wall, and, as the prevailing winds have
the same direction, the distribution of
rainfall corresponds closely. It is
found that the very similar cilmatic and
topograhic conditions have produced
similar plants. The languishing of
agriculture in Palestine seems to be a
result of poor government, not of sterile
soil end arid climate, and it is believed
that under better management the econo
mic olants that flourish in California
will be successfully introduced. Among
the plants discovered in Palestine is
wheat, growing wild in high altitudes
on sterile toil, that is considered the
prototype of our cultivated varieties.

The curious transparency of gold leaf
when heated in contact with glass has
been found by J. C. Chapman and H.
L. Porter to have a curvloua expluna
tion. When gild leaf was stretched on
a platinum loop and hea ed in a doubl«
walled quartz crucible, it became more
taut with rise in temperature, and
eventually the contraction tore the leaf
in places. The contraction temperature
was about M) degrees C. A leaf held
by one side was weighted on the other
edge to keep It under tension, and after
reaching the critical temperature it con
tracted very rapidly with further In
crease. The microscope showed a
change to a structure decidedly more
granular. The effect is produced in the
leaf only, and on heating gold wire
there was r.o contraction. The tran
sparency when heated on glass is at
tributed to the numerous clear spaces
produced by the tearing of the leaf.
An interesting substitute for frescoes
in outside decoration has been pro
posed by Prof. Wm, Ostwald. The
fresco was suitable for the Middle Aijes,
but the sulphuric acid always present
in the air of coal-burning cities causes
such decoration to be rapidly destroyed
at the present day. The resisting
ornamentation to take its place is a
pastel done upon a specially prepared
ground, then fixed with chemicals,
and finally rubbed over with paraffin. A
two per cent solution of casein serves
as fixing material. The acid causes the
paraffin to become insoluble, and the
picture is thus preserved by the very
agent that so rapidly effaces all fres
coes. A sterilized base is a safe-guard
against internal bacterial decomposition,
imparting durability within as well as
without.
Ferro-concrete as a building material
for resisting earthquakes seems to have
very favorably impressed Profs. Omori
and Nakamura, Japan's seismological
experts. In Messina , they fftund
examples of construction with this
material. A house was quite unaffected,
and in some factories with brick walls
and ferro-concrete frame, the former
had fallen out while the latter was left
intact. A large reservoir of brick was
completely destroyed ; a similar reser
voir of ferro-concrete passed through
the earthquake without damage.

CAST O R I AEMMA LEDOUX
PLEADS GUILTY
Of the Trunk Murder in Stockton
Sentenced to Imprisonment for Life.
From Stockton Independent Jan. 27
When it became known that the evi
dence of the medical experts was against
her, Airs Le Doux gave up the fight and
last Saturday she wrote to her attorney,
C. H. Fairall, that she was determined
to plead guilty. She had been of the
same md several weeks ago, and word
went out then that she was ready to
plead guilty if assured of a life sentence
but of course the promise could not be
made for the court and the matter was
not taken up to Judge Nutter until yes
terday.
Yesterday morning's court scene, as
.far- as San Joaquin county and. local
officials arc concerned, terminated fur
ther interest in the gruesome and har
rowing tale of the incidents connected
with the murder, the subsequent placing
of the body in the trunk and the at
tempt to ship the remains from Stockton
to the home of the mother of the mur
deress, away back in the hills of Ama
dor county, where chance of discovery
seemed impossible to Emma Le Doux,
who calculating^ and with cunning suc
ceeded in getting the body of her victim
as far as the Southern Pacific depot,
where, owing to a slight error of detail
in* making shipping arrangements the
horrible truth was revealed.
Just before the opening hour of the
court yesterday Emma Le Doux, . accom
panied by her counsel, C. H. Fairall,
district attorney George F. McNoble and
deputy district attorney Grimm, ■ ap
peared to plead guilty to the charge of
murder in the first degree and accept
whatever fate held out for her. Im
mediately after the court session district
attorney McNoble to the 96
witnesses who had been subpoenaed by
the prosecution preparatory to the second
trial, which was to commence Febru
ary 2nd, excusing them from attendance.
Noted Criminal Case.
The first trial of Emma Le Doux for
the murder of Albert McVi car cost San
Joaquin county more than $10,000 and
was one of the most spectacular cases
ever held in the west. .More than 3000
rulings were made by Judge W. B.
Nutter, who presided, and attorney
Fairall for the defense and Judge C. W.
Norton, then district attorney, and
George. F. McNoble, then assistant dis
trict attorney, represented the people. ■ -
At no time sines her arrest has' Mrs
Le Doux ever admitted her guilt or
made any sort of a confession but did
incriminate herself in a few instances
by certain statements made.
Formal Proceedings.
The formal court proceedings in all
its details just as they were conducted
at the session yesterday morning are as
follows :
• The Court :— The people against Le
Doux. . -
Mr Fairall— lt the court please,. I . ap
pear in obedience to the written com
mand of my client to perform . a solemn
duty. By the long confinement which
she has undergone, I find her broken in
health, in spirit and in mind. She
wishes to plead guilty. I ask, therefore,
* to' I ' withdraw the former plea of not
guilty made by her.
The court— ls that your wish, Mrs Le
Doux; to withdraw your plea of not
■guilty?
The Defendant— lt is.
The Court— What is your plea now?
The Defendant— Guilty.
The Court— Let the plea of guilty be
enterd, Mr Clerk. Any evidence to be
offered here respecting the degree of the
crime?
Mr McNoble— l will offer the evi
dence given at the first hearing in this
matter.
The Court— The testimony taken at
the previous trial is received for the
purpose of fixing the degree of the
crime, and upon that the court fixes
aad determines the degree of the crime
to be that of murder of the first degree.
Under the law, Mrs LeDoux, you are
entitled to two days before the judg
ment of tf c court may be pronounced
upon your plea of guilty at this time
entered, or you may waive that time
and have the judgment or sentence
pronounced at this time; which do you
want to do£ Have it now?
The Defendant— Yes, sir.
Gist of Court Trial.
The Court— On the 2nd day of April,
U)O6, the grand jury of this county
returned to this court an indictment
against you charging you with the
crime or murder, alleged to have been
committed on the 24th day or March,
IDOO,, charging therein that you did
upon that date willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, and or your malice afore
thought, kill and murder one Albert N.
McVicar, a human being, then and
there being. Upon being arraigned up
on this indictment you entered a plea of
not guilty and your case was thereafter
set for trial; you were represented by
counsel, a |ury was empaneled and
trial had. Subsequent to that time, and
at the conclusion of the trial the jury
returned a verdict as follows: "We,
the jury In the above entitled cause,
find the defendant, Emma Le Doux,
guilty of murder of the first degree."
Thereupon and thereafter a motion for a
new trial was made and denied by this
court, and the court pronounced its
judgment upon the verdict so rendered
by the jury. Subsequent to that time an
appeal was taken to the Supreme court
of this state. The supreme court, after
due consideration, reversed the judg
ment of the court and remanded the
case for retrial. After that time the
remittitur of the Supeme court was
filed in this court and your case, was re
gularly set for trial for February 2, 1910,
at the hour of 10 o'clock. Today, at
your request, you have been brought In
to court and ask that you be allowed
to change your plea of not guilty to that
of guilty; you have also waived the two
days allowed by statute and requested
and consented that the judgment of the
court should be at this time 1 pronounced
against you, and. the court has received
the evidence and testimony taken at the
former trial,- and thereupon, and upon
the same, has fixed and determined the
degree of the crime to be' that of mur
der of the first degree. Have you any
legal cause now to show why the judg
ment of the court should not be pro
nounced?.
ftlr Fairall— No legal cause, your
honor.
The Court— Have you anything to' say
before it is pronounced? ■ '*,'■ '.'
Fairall's Pathetic Appeal.
:Mr Fairall— The defendant has pleaded
guilty, and the judgment of the law is
about to be pronounced upon that plea,
but before it is done I wish to say' I
still believe her innocent of the crime
charged. She has not testified in her
own behalf, but 1 am satisfied with and
believe the story of this unfortunate
affair she related to me at our first in
terview. She told me that she did not
kill Albert N. McVicar, but on coming
back to the room where they had spent
the night together, after several hours'
absence, she found him dead. Stunned
and dazed by the awful realization of
her situation, she sought to hide the
body from the sight of man; she fled
from the place!' "All her words and acts
thereafter only the more firmly bound
her about with a" chain of circumstantial
evidence untilshe fell exhausted at the
prison. door, beaten and hopeless.
If it be said that innocence does not
flee, .1 can only reply that such words
are uttered out of the mouth of inex
perience. Have we 'not read "in the
Bible the story of Jacob and Laban?
Laban, who had accused Jacob of theft,
asked. "Wherefore didst thou flee
away secretly, and steal away from me?",
and the old patriarch, who could not
justly be accused of stealing anything,
answered and said to Laban, "Because
I was afraid." , ,
She is overcome by the ' oppressing
force of the situation and, convinced of
the hopelessness of further struggle,
she seeks- the solace of forgetfulness
within the prison walls.
A frail and delicate woman, under
the terrible strain and suspense she has
"gone to wrack, disturbed and torn!"
Without friends and without means,
whichever way she turns she looks on
the face of a foe. The physicians say
she is physically able to go to trial, but
in spite of the judgment of these men
she is too ill to contend any further.
Poor woman, she has suffered ■ much ;
let us hope that her compensation will
be complete rest.
I ask for the greatest indulgence in
the power of the court to grant.
Sentenced for Life.
You may resume standing, just a
moment, Mrs Le Doux, please. No
legal cause appearing, it is the judg
ment of the court you be imprisoned - in
the state prison at San Quentin for the
term of your life, and you are remanded
to the custody of the sheriff of San
Joaquin county in execution of * the
judgment.

Mr C. H. Fairall, San Francisco,
Cal.— Dear Sir. Owing to the condi
tion of my health, which has become
badly shattered by four years' confine
ment, 1 do not feel able to stand the
strain of another trial.
1 therefore have decided to plead
guilty and I want you to do what you
can to dispose of the matter quickly.
Yours sincerely,
MRS EMMA LeDOUX.

Saved At Death's Door
The door of death seemed ready to
open for Murray W. Ayers, of Transit
Bridge N. V., when his'life was won
derfully saved. "I. was in v dreadful
condition," he writes, "my skin was
almost yellow; 'eyes sunken: tongue
coated; emaciated from losing 40
pounds, growing weaker daily. Viru
lent liver trouble ' pulling me down to
death in spite of doctors. Then that
matchless medicine-electric bitters
cured me. I regained the 40 pounds
lost and now am well and strong."
For all stomach, liver and kidney
troubles they're supreme. 50c at Spag
