THE FREMONT MINE
DISASTROUS FIRE
A Correction of Unjust Criticism Concerning
llllthat Calamity.  H«I
The terrible tragedy'in the Fremont
nine by which eleven men lost their
ives last week, will cause sonic
people to remark that there should
:ie moro thorough . inspection of
nines, and greater precautions taken
;o protect the \ lives 'of the , miners.
.Ye knew bat few of the particulars
)f this fatal accident, but from what
,vo do know it appears that there was
ilmost criminal carelessness on the
part of some one. The lowering of
Me thirteen men into a, burning shaft
would seem to have been • a prevent
able thing. Again, here is a 'mine
that has j been operated successfully
Eor 50 years and yet its main works
were 500 feet below the only connect
ing drift to a connecting shatt. 'jj6
low the 600 foot level, the men were
dependent on a single shaft for escape
from any accident on the • levels be
low."— Calaveras Prospect.
It is to be regretted that our cotem
porary should publish the above un
just criticism, based upon misconcep
tion of the facts. The honor is a
terrible ordeal to all concerned, with
out the added pain of misrepresenta
tion. How the fire started \will pro
bably.^ never be , definitely : known.'
The only supposition is that , one of
the miners had stuck his - lighted
candle in the timbers of the shaft,
and left it bur rung during the luncb
hour; that in this way. the timbers of
the shaft were ignited below the 10UU
foot level. [ The mine is very ! dry,
and the shatf timbers ■ at certain
points would ' readily ' buru. There
were no surface iudicacions at the
tirno the meu' were -lowered -into the
shaft that, the mine was < on_tl£e— no
sSioHe Tlslug-Ffora the- shaf f to~con vßy7
any intimation of danger. • The men
had only left the underground worLs
— an hour before. . Our cotemporaiy is
mistaken wheu he says there ] was no
connection with another shaft below
the 500 foot level. The truth is/the
shafts are connected at the 70U foot
and 1300 foot levels, and we are in
formed that access from every part of
the mine wa3 availablo to either of
these connecting drifts. .>£ is im
possible to guard against such care
less'actions of an iudividuul employe,
if this solution of the origin of the
fire is' correct.
It is reasonably certain that most
if not all the men coin prisiug that
fatal" skip load would have been
saved, with the exercise ofsGher
judgment and forethought in the pre
sence of the peril. Two m«n escaped,
and thoy were riding in the : bottom
of the skip, end therefore among the
last to leavo tho cage. They climbed
up to the TOO level, and groping in
darkness made their way 800 teet to
the Grover shaft. The way thoy
traveled to safety was equally', open
to the others, provided of course they
were not disabled by the disaster that
befell the descending skip. | Concern
ing what occui red among the meu
who were riding on top when they
were first made aware of tbe fact that
the shaft was on fire, there is but
meager information. Naturally, Then
they wore brought suddenly face to
face with threatened death, each man
acted on the impulse of the. moment
to insure his own safety. There was
no concert ot action; no consultation
as to ihe ; best way to meet the
emergency. From all that cau bo
learned, there cau be little doubt
that had this course been pursued
most, if not all tho meu, wouJd have
been saved.
The one thing os.pociaily that this
calamity has brought to the front is
the necessity of having somo one on
each skin charged with commanding
authority during the process of hoist
ing or lowering into the mine. •; It.
would seem that while on the cage
one man is equal to another in point
of authority. If any thing happens
there is no one in particular to
assume command. At least this
would seem to be the case with regard
to the unfortunate victims of the
Fremont disaster. The case is an
unusual one, and probably nothing
like it will occur again in a genera
tion. For a shaft from which they had
emerged only a brief space before to
become a death trap during the time
they were partaking of lunch, ' was
never dreamed of, either by the ■ men
themselves or tbe . management.
Human foresight could not be - ex
pected to anticipate such a catas'i
trophe. Experience is -the stern
teacher in such cases.' Perhaps no
possible precaution , in the way of
selecting a captain over tbe descend
ing men— one of their own number
would have avoided the , sacrifice of
life which occurred. Men are in > a
great measure uncontrollable in the
presence of sudden danger. Still It
would seem that every load of men
lowered intojor hoisted from ■ a mine
should have one aboard p charged with
supreme' command, disobedience to
whose orders should subject the . in
dividual to .instant discharge. The
captain of a ship maybe no braver
man than the individuals comprising
his crew. But the very fact of; his
responsibility tends to make him
careful aud thoughtful, and when
disaster is imminent, :" his duty Ito
those in his charge' is : uppermost lin
his mind— their safety is paramount.
He is not apt to become rattled nr
lose his presence of mind. with this
load .of responsibility attached to
him.
This characteristic of human nature
was brought into strong relief in the
case of this Fremont disaster. = The
conduct of the" officers of the' mine,
as soon as the situation became
known, was highly commendable.
Superintendent Goodall not only did
not hesitate to invade the danger
zone, bat led the way into the burn
ing pit< in his anxiety to -eave,. if
■•ossible, the lives of tb9 miners.
The sense of personal danger was for
gotten, or at least subservient to the
task iof trying to : rescue those im
prisoned by the Hre.
In this connection, it is not out of
place to say. that tho situation in
-Which_iiuperintendent--Oo6dan was
placed; after nil hope of '..the
men alivo had to bo abandoned, ■ was
the most delicate and trying imagin
able. -There were scures of relatives
and friends about the shaft whose
natural affection prompted, them to
cling to. the hope that the imprisoned
men might still be 'living,' even long
after those in charge were convinced
that the case was a hopeless one.
They would not believe the men were
dead, until the physical fact was
brought before them. Xhis compli
cated an otherwise delicate matter.
Mr. Goodall having Charge of the
property, his first duty was to rescue
the men if possible. When this was
no longer possible, his duty was to
adopt such measures as would pro
tect tbe property of the compauy,
by extinguishing the fire. Two ways
were open to accomplish this, name
ly, flooding the mine, or bulkhead
ing the shafts so as to render the
shatfs air tight, thereby smothering
tho fire. To the adoption of either
of these courses tho affection of tbe
relatives of the victims would natural
ly rebel. It is impossible to couceive
of a more trying position.

FRENZIED FINANCE.
The failure of the California safe deposit and / trust; com
pany has brought to light one of the worst instances of crim
inal bank wrecking that has' occurred in the history of the
, state. . Coming at a time of financial stringency, and with
public confidence in .banking institutions at a low. ebb^ makes
it the more deplorable and far-reaching in its eflfect^ -And the
bank commissioners; paid- a; liberal from the
treasury to. keep posted on the methods and standing of such
institutions, and clothed with : ample authority to safeguard
the interests of depositors, are as culpable as the bank man
agers themselves. They, whether wilfully or ignorantly it
matters not, betrayed their trust.'. .The methods pursue
the defunctconcern for a long time prior to thecollapse were
such as to awaken suspicion in the mind of any man of ordi
nary business capacity that there was something amiss. The
bank was making desperate efforts to increase its deposits, 1
by offering as high as 4 per cent on[ ordinary savings de
posits^ which is considerably hjgtier than other savings in
stitutions in the, city have been paying. ' It was simply. a
scheme to replenish its; exhausted coffersby catching the un
wary by promises of, extravagantly high > rates of interest.
Evidently the sister banks of the city were aware. of its shady
transactions and unsound condition .long before the; final
crash. \ When the run started no offer of assistance came
from other banks, which , would surely have been the case
had they been satisfied that ; «it was traveling in the, pathway
of safe financeering. To tender assistance in the event of : a
run on a solvent bank, born of a sudden and unreasonable
scare among depositors, is a well-recognized principle in tlie
world of finance. It is done for the protection of all, and not
merely to help the one in temporary distress. It is better to
stay, a financial panic in its inception than to permit it to grow
into whirlwind dimensions. But the rotten California safe
deposit concern was allowed to sink without the slightest
friendly intervention, no doubt for the reason that it was
impossible to prop it up without incurring graver perils than
were involved in its downfall. And, the bank, commissioners,
who are paid to make themselves acquainted, with the inside
history of such monetary concerns, stood idly by and watched
this striking example of frenzied finance work itself out to
its inglorious end— the hands of a receiver. Jlf the officers of
the bank are worthy of stripes for- criminal recklessness in
squandering funds intrusted to their care, the state commis
sioners have earned prosecution in some shape for failure to
grasp a 'situation that demanded decisive action on their part*
Governor Sparks of Nevada is to be commended for his
prompt action in calling for federal troops for the preservation
of order in Goldfield.-. The strike ordered by the hot-heads
of the Western Federation of Miners, ostensibly in protest
of the payment of wages of its members in clearing-house cer
tificate, has developed into a contest between the mine
owners and the labor unions for supremacy in the conduct of
the mines. Realizing the nature of the struggle, and the
exteme measures that would likely be resorted to if the con
tending factions were permitted to fight out the quarrel alone,
the governor had three hundred soldiers wearing the uniform
of Uncle Sam quartered within easy distance of the camp be
-ore the turbulent spirits of the warring "forces had time to
organize a plan of campaign. The owners are determined to
rid themselves of intolerant dictation of the labor organiza
tions. They will run the mines on the open-shop plan, or
keep them closed indefinitely. To enable them to have a
square deal the federal forces have been called in to prevent
violence and bloodshed. Martial law will be' proclaimed at
the first outbreak of violence. It is safe to say that the fire
brands will hesitate to [ involve themselves in a trial of
strengh with the national troops. In painful contrast with
the decisive stand of governor Sparks was the conduct of the
California authorities in the recent strike of the street-car
men. . If one tithe of the same backbone had been displayed
in that struggle what a lot of. suffering, and loss of property
and prestige would have been spared San Francisco. The
" unwflipped mob," as general Funston dubbed them, would
not have needed so many weary months of strife before quit
ting had the Sparks' plan been adopted in the first place in
stead of the weak, half-hearted course that was pursued.

Beo Comb.
Bee comb or. beeswax, the material
of which the honey cells in the. beehive
are composed, is a was produced by a
system of chemistry carried on in' the
''was pockets", which aro located in the
abdomen of all working bees. It Is a
peculiar -substance" and is said to be
analogous -to 'the: fats of, higher ani
onals. Originally it was supposed that
this wax was taken' np in an almost
pure state from 'the flowers by 'the
bees, : but experiments carried on by
the leading botanists and chemists of
the world conclusively , prove that .the
bee is capable of elaborating his pecul
iar wax, although confined to a diet
purely saccharin in' its nature.

"Sir,", responded the candid captain,
"you took passage on my ship as ' a
Dane. I don't believe you're anything
of the kind." v .
The passenger smiled. The; smile
was full of perspicacity and confidence

obvious that unless ;' something, were
done to bring him to his senses the de
lusion must soon become actuality — he
would die of starvation. ' ' The strangest
ruse was tried.' v Half a dozen attend
ants,, draped in ghostly white, crept
silently in single file into the room ad

down where jhe could see them to a

'.'; Irish Sarcasm.
j A happy : and humorous example , of
sarcasm as apart from repartee is af
forded by | the following anecdote.' - 1
quote it on the authority of a friend,
who, I am; afraid, was the villain of
the • incident: . A most imperturbable
man was followed from Westmoreland
street,; • Dublin, : > over . the .O'Connell
bridge to the general postofflce by two
little street arabs, who importuned
him for the end of his cigar. "Throw
us the butt, sir! /Ah, sir, throw us the
butt!" cried the youths, but as the man
did not betray the slightest conscious
ness of their existence they gave him
up at last in despair and disgust. ,"Ar
rah, let him alone," T said one, with the
most . scorching scotn. j "Shure, it's: a
butt he's picked up himself."
I once heard a buibptious little man,
who, 'acting as steward at athletic
sports in . Dublin,' was very assertive
in , keeping back the crowd, thus ad
dressed by an angry spectator: "If the
consate was taken out of yez, ye'd be
no bigger than a—'green gooseberry,
and ye're as sour as wan already:"—

Happiness From Troubles.
j Being human, happily or unhappily,
we . cannot deny . the comfort y to .be
found in the reflection t that misery
never lacks tha company it loves. We
all have our troubles, and some of us
v derive much satisfaction from the con
templation of them. Indeed, there are
those who are happy only when .wretch
ed, but these we believe to be as few
In' number as they are disagreeable, in
association. The vast majority of hu
mans are normal and disposed, there
fore, -In conformity with natural law,
to smile when the skies are clear and
to grieve under the portent of clouds;
hence the ease ith which worry takes
possession of the mind, colors the dis
position and makes a cripple of effort
That causes abound we know and
must admit, . as we do almost uncon
sciously the certainty of death, but
too little cognizance is taken of the
fact that the effect of mere apprehen
sion, which is all that worry really is,
may be subjected to simple mental
treatment and be overcome.— George
Harvey in North .American Review.
Vernet and the Veteran.
. "When Horace Vernet, the great
French painter -of battle scenes, was
at the height of his fame," said an art
ist, '.'when the prices he was getting
'were enormous, a grizzled old veteran
came to him one day and said:
" 'I want you to make my picture to
send home to my son. What, though,
is your charge?' j
| " 'How much are you willing to pay?*
said Vernet, , smiling.
'"A franc and a half,' was the an
swer.
" 'Very good.'
"And the artist, with a few quick
strokes, dashed off a wonderful sketch
of the old man. ' ' .
"The old man paid, tucked the sketch
under his arm and carried it out tri
umphantly tQ a comrade who awaited
him outside.
" 'But I did wrong not to haggle a
bit,' Vernet overheard him say. 'I
might have got it for a franc' "

Copyrisht, 1907. by JI. 31. Cunningham.'
. AYe were at the Blj? Tree grove, little
eastern bred ; Muriel, with pelargoni
ums at her slender waist," and I, a
western writer. We had wandered
through the inner, grove, where the
most mighty monarchs are— the Giant,
General Sherman, Jumbo,' the Sisters
and others. We had reveled nt the
contrasts between trees 300 feet high
and the cream cups and other sweet
spring flowers j nestling at their ,J, J feet.
Then wo hr.d gone through the gates
into the outer forest and were sitting
at the river's edge at the end of the
"THE MIKACLE OF THE PELARGOXICM!"
swinging bridge. The rest of the par
ty stayed away.";.We were to have this
little goodby^ hour apart,., 1.. '.;..,.';
jj "The Giant: is G5 feet in circum
ference, ( 30C - feet • high r and ) is,' esti
mated to be 3,000 years old," chanted
Muriel in the words of the guide." "Or
was it 5,000? Three thousand or 5,000?
Oh, dear! Must I always refer to my
notebook? Can I tell nothing with
out always referring to my notebook?"
she demanded'wildly. \ . . _
: I took the notebook from her.
"Your lips were not made for facts,
dry as dust. They were made fort'—:
I had intended to say for poetry and
romance. ; I truly had; but, chancing to
look at those lips, ■ so. red, so daintily
curved, so wondrously alluring," I. said
"kisses,", and I proved my, assertion.
No man could have helped it.'
Of "course she was very angry. A
suppose I would not have had her oth
erwise, but she did not spring to her
feet and run from me. ■/
: "I will not apologize, for you. know I
wantJyou so. Muriel," I pleaded.,
She regarded me scornfully.
' "As I have told you before, I will not
mate with a dreamer. Why do you not
go into the world and do some mighty
work? Everybody"— '
" 'Everybody works but father?' " I
interrupted politely. •
Even with my heart sore I could nev
er help laughing at Muriel and her fine
talk of workers —little dainty wisp of
a creature, born to be worshiped and
cared for, but taking so serious a view
of life!
"Would you Jiave me a hodcarrler?"
I asked.; "As It is, I dream, and my
dream makes a book, and the book
brings some dollars, and the dollars
make several things possible. If I
were a hodcarrier it would mean sim
ply dollars, though' perhaps fewer of
them. So the result is approximately
the same, and you have no idea how
much pleasanter it is to. dream than
to carry bricks." I
"You are a trifler," j she declared.
"You ought to write a book which will
make the world better." o ... .
"I am quite sure my books never hurt
anybody's morals or manners," I in
sisted gently.
"Only a negative virtue," she re
sponded. "The man I marry must be
positive. He must look"—.
She hesitated, gazing down at her
Lady Washington flowers, which she
had taken from her belt.
"How?" I asked, with some interest.
"I don't deny that I should be will-
Ing that he should look like you," she
admitted, a fine color coming into her
cheeks. "If only you would do some
thing to make the world better!"
My mood bad changed.' I would
plead no longer with this child. My
mind went to the packet of letters I
counted as among my treasures. They
ihad come from different parts of the
country after my first book had been
launched. According to these, my mis
sion was not a failure —my book,
though a simple one, had made better
at least a part of the world, but I
would not tell-Muriel this. I would not
try ti> influence her in the least I
arose and held out my hand. In the
distance the train was whlstllsg.
' "One , thing remember, dear child," 1
eaid gravely, ' "and ; that is that love
blazes its own paths and cuts its own
channels.% If it be written that you are
for me j you will marry ". me ; in \ good
time.': ,Love brooks no interference in
his realm." '■ '-.: <. ' ;
.Her cheeks stormed into color as I
helped her. to' her feet .':
"Do you see this Lady Washington?"
she demanded, holding the pelargoni
um before me. '"See,. I lay it, in the
hollow of this little big tree. There Is
dirt in the hollow, and the pelargoni
um may grow. Coming again, I may
find that it has taken root. So may I
become your wife. The one is as pos
sible as the other."
So Muriel went back to the east with
i her schemes of | philanthropy, and I
stayed in my ; west to dream and then
to write,' but I found that dreaming
had grown to be a weary task when
the | most beauteous one of them all
was a forbidden one, for I . had lost
faith in my own brave avowal of love's'
omnipotence. • j
f Nearly ■ al'a 1 ' year had . gone ■ before I
visited ! the Big -Tree | grove again. . I
went alone' and took my solitary way
lo the river where I had said goodby
to my dream of dreams. J A furious
storm had wrought ' some havoc there. 1
Two ' or three ' of the lesser . trees had
fallen,'^ and the • swinging , bridge had
been . twisted ; and broken , and thrown
upon'the bank, while the swollen river
ragedangrilyby.it ; '.:;.' i . • ','
At last I turned 'away from my sad
retrospection. 'My • ( eyes -' caught '. a

somehow ■I : thought | of . Muriel's ■ dress
as ' it looked on that other day . when
she had not been kind. But just then I
was « joined ;, by « the : guide, ; who was

Short Names.
An English clergyman, Dr. Frederick
Lee, had a prejudice against a . long
string of Christian names and held that
If such names •were proposed the cler-'
gyman should . alter them at baptism
whether the parents were willing 'or
not. It was said of him that he chris
tened all the boys Frederick after him
self and : all the girls Mary after the
Virgin. The author of "The Life of
Walter Pater" gives Dr. Lee's method
of christening as follows:' /.'■", ""- '■'
"Name this child," he would say in
his authoritative voice. .'
"Archibald , Cholmondeley Constan
tine ■ Ferdinand,", perhaps the mother
would whisper. ..'
' "Frederick," she. would hear, to her
amazement, and then would follow the
formula of baptism.
■ In the vestry of course there would
be objection. ■ '•■[ : ;>
"This child," Dr. Lee would reply,
"will have to get . his living in the
world, and what do yon want to handi
cap him with Archibald Campbell
Cholmondeley and all the rest of them
for? Anyhow, it's done now and can't
be altered." . ■ ' ■
Better Unknown.
Into the yard of the great factory
crept the ragged urchin, while the
owner of the establishment watched
him from the doorway.
Presently the urchin bent down and
picked up a piece of string. This
moved the heart of the merchant
prince, and he stepped forward.
"My lad," he said, "I have a vacancy
for an office boy at 10 shillings a week.
If you like, I'll give you ,the ; job, for
I'm sure you will be a nice, careful
boy. I saw you pick up that string,
and a boy who is careful in little
things will be careful in big things.
Is It a bargain?"
It was, but as the urchin sped home
to tell his mother about his good for
tune he muttered darkly:
"If he only knew that I picked up
that string to fix a tin to his dog's
tail!"— London Tit-Bits.

The ponderous piece of machinery
kfor the shaft of the Electric, plant,
which was sent to Sun Francisco for
repairs owing to the damage done by
the wreck of three months ago, was
shipped on its return trip from the
i! foundry last week. It was found that
it was out of the true line only a
fraction of the 100 part of an inch.
Of course, it had to be reduced to
i twice the amount of bend. Even this
light bend would have been sufficient
to cause trouble on account of the
high speed and enormous weight ot
the machinery to be moved. By the

the repaired shaft . will again be on

The Fremont Fire.
There is little ohange to note in
the situation at the Fremont mine
from that stated in these columns
last issue. The " Fremont shaft has
been closed up, and steam has been
forced down the shaft tor the purpose
of extinguishing the fire, should it
be still smoldering iv the heavy tim
bers. It is generally thought that
the fire was confined to the MOO foot
level, and immediate vicinity. That
point is the only spot in the shaft
where heavy caving ground was en
countered in sinking. So that wnile
considerable debris may have choked
the shaft at this place, it is not sup
posed that the damage is very great.
The Gover shaft is open, and men
can travel from top to : bottom with
out experiencing serious trouble.  It
is '.bnlkheaded at certain ' points to
shut off the draft from the Fremont
opening. -
There is no smoke issuing from the
Fremont. For several days there has
been nothing to* indicate that the fire
was still burning. From last ac
counts, it was thought that no effort
would be made to uncover the shaft
tor several days, probably not until
the beginning of next week.
■ Nothing further has been recalled
concerning the eleven victims of the
disaster. All hope of their suvival
has long since been abandoned.
Even -in . bulkheading, precautions
were taken that in case any of the
missing ones should reach the barrier,
they could easily force a way through
to safety. . : •
FRIDAY, DECEMBEEf 13^ 1907: ;
A Jackson Pioneer
Passes Away
S v W. Bright, one of; the oldest.
settlers and pioneer business men of
this community, passed away at the
home of Mrs . Yelland, beyond 1 New
manville, at about 11 o'clock Tuesday
night, after a brief illness. . | lie had
been failing for a long time. Indeed,
he . never fully \ recovered ' from a
severe sickness of over a year; ago;
although able to be around and at
tend to his business- as usual. Ke
cently he went to his ranch in the
vicinity of Gait, where, he kept" a
large flock of sheep.' He was there a
few . days, . and daring . : that time
sustained a heavy fall, which shook
him up badly; He tell over a slight
embankment not over's feet, aliehti
ing-ou his stomach. He was alone and
lay helpless -'fully.:' half -an hour.
It .did:', net 'disable 'him, however,
and he returned home in his buggy
the middle of last week alone as was
his custom. But he was far from
being well, suffering from a cold as
well as the fall. He went to the resi
dence of - Mrs .Yelland, , and every
thing was done for him "that .careful
nursing could suggest. His ailment
was deemed by himself of no serious
character. His i physician ! was . not
summoned until atfer ' he 'had been
home ' several days,' but simple
remedies were applied. Failing :to
improve; Dr. Phillips was summoned
Sunday last, and found him suffering
from ' stomach trouble, largely - the
result of the fall. . On Monday he ap
peared much improved, and also "on
Tuesday morning, so much so in fact
that the physician thought it would
not be necessary to see him that day.
But; about ' three o'clock that, after
noon the doctor was hastily summon
ed, and found that a material change
for the worse bad occurred. 'Every
thing possible was done to rally
him. The doctor remained for three
hours, but ' the system ■ failed :to
respond to any ;of the 'remedial
methods.- The physician '.realized
that the end was near,' and told .. his
patient, who was perfectly conscious,
to settle his business affairs, . and
send for any friends or relatives he
wished to see. The dying man would
not believe that he was so near to
death,' saying that ; be would arrange
bis affairs on the morrow if . lie felt
no better. The doctor left, and about
half past eight the same evening he
was again hurriedly summoned. This
was not unexpected, as to bis practic
ed eye it was only a question of a
few hours when he left him the same
afternoon. ."..-'He ' oontinued- to' (fail
rapidly and death came, shortly after
llo'clocki .
Mrs:' Bright was informed of 'his
critical condition, but did not; see
him alive. Some three years ago Mr
Bright left bis 'comfortable I home on
Pitt and Stump streets, and the hus
band and wife had lived apart since,
Mrs Bright occupying too homestead
and Mr Bright living at the Clone
hotel when in town. . Mrs Bright felt
the situation keenly. She was Hardly
prepared to believe that her lite com
panion of over 40 years was about to
pass away.
The remains were removed to the
residence of Mrs Bright on -Wednes
day afternoon, and the funeral took
place to-day.
Deceased was a kind-hearted, up
right citizen. He was not a member
of any religious or- fraternal organi
zation. He was ever ready to extend
a helping hand to the needy. He had
his peculiarities of character, but the
bumane,and kindly side was strange
ly in the ascendant. .V
He leaves an estate variously v esti
mated from 830,000 to 850,000. His
sheep ranch in the lower county com
prises several thousand head, run
ning on leased land. His realty, com
prising the slaugtber-house ranch,
partly within the . city - limits, . is a
valuable tract, upon which the Bright
mine is located, which is a promising
quartz prospect. He leaves no
children. It' is generally believed
that he made no will. Besides his
wife, the heirs > are a nephew, a
brother's child,' Herbert Brignt of
Oakland, and relatives in the eastern
states.
We take the following from his
biographical sketch published some
years ago : |§§|| "
He was born in Massachusetts, on
the 27th of May, 1831, .'and is of Eng
lish lineagel ■' Hi 3 grandfather, Jesse
Bright, w«s a native' of England and
became the progenitor of the family
iv the United States. - Mr. Bright was
the eldest of six children, was educat
ed in the publio schools of his native
town and there learned the two
trades of shoemaking and.- butcher
ing. In 1851 he took passage on the
Philadelphia, bound tor California,
and by way of the isthmus route
came to this state, landing at San
Krauciseo on the 10th of. December
of that year. tie made his .way
direct to Mokelumne Hill, and* on
the 20th of the same month began
mining on his own account, but not
meeting with the success he had
anticipated, he turned his attention
to the dairy business, owning twenty
cows. He did the milking and then
sold the milk" among~the Tpeo'pleTof
the locality, receiving, three dollars*a
gallon. Corn; meal ' then the
principal mill product that could be
obtained, arid twenty-five cents : a
pound -was paid for it. vMr Bright
continued in the dairy • business for
two years, and then began butchering
at West Point, in Sandy . Gulch.v It
was a rice gulch, where many miners
were engaged in the \ search for the
precious metal, and he there conduct
ed three shops, meeting with excel
lent success. He also ~ became ' con
nected/with mining interests,' employ
ing others, however, ■to do the prac
tical work.: In 1858 he '__ sold his
butchering business and for two years
gave bis attention to quartz-mining,
in 1860 he came to Jackson' where he
purchased the meat ■ market of the
Wiley '• Brothers and\ for forty years
be was the conductor ot that shop,
enjoying a large and profitable trade,
selling to Geo.' Thomas 10 years ago.
He has 'a -very wide acquaintance
among the old settlers of this section
of the state .and , has through u long
years ' supplied their ' tables . with
choice . meats > at . reasonable- prices.
His honorable business methods and
his earnest desire to please has secur
ed for him a very '. liberal . patronage
and he derives therefrom a comfort
able competence,* He has been con
nected with mining - interests' from
the time he located here and is » still
the, owner J of j considerable, mining
stock.' ' He has also made judicious
investments in "real estate and 'now
owns a number of business blocks and
dwellings in Jackson, being account
ed one of the well-to-do citizens of
the place. In 1862,' when a disastrous
fire swept : over the town, his ' losses
amounted to four thousand dollars,
for he had no< insurance upon his
property. This did not distourage
him, however, for with renewed effort
he continued his work and soon re
gained all that ho had lost.' , In
December,' lß6l,' Mr Bi'ight was united
iv marriage to Miss Martha '£. Brad

They have' lost their; only child, a

immediate cause of death was an
attack of pneumonia. She had, how

Burglary and Robbery.
A daring burglary and : robbery was
perpetrated on Saturday; evening last
at the residence of James Harris on
Broadway. The' party i who did the
crime is thought to be well acquaint
ed with the premi ses, and ; the - place
where the money and other valuables
were kept. : iMr and Mrs ~ Harris at
tended the dramatic entertainment in
Love's hall that : evening, and the
absence ' of . the occupants was; seized
as the opportunity, to enter ; arid per
petrate the robbery.' Alt was the cus
tom - of . Mrs . Harris', to : leave what'
money was in the^bouae in a tin cash
box left standing on a bureau, which
was also the repository ' for valuable
papers, such as "■ insurance : policies,
stock certificates, also a lady's gold
watch.. Fortunately ; she took the
precaution this time to take with her
the cash that was usually kept therein
and also another and > more | valuable
watch; '^The burglar entered through
a window on the "south 'side r *of. the
house,* and' made off with the box
with whatever it contained. Upon
returning from the show .Mr and Mrs
Harris were : unaware, that the pre
mises had been : burglarized ■ until an
hour or so after arriving home. '.When
about to retire, it was noticed: that
the box was missing. The sheriff's
office was notified and sheriff Gregory
and deputy jConners were promptly
on hand to investigate. The traces of
the burglar, about the window were
plainly discernable, but no other
traces were left. ' The window was
left unfastened, so that' the intruder
bad merely to raise the sash to get
in,' closing it when he made his
exit. There was nothing else disturb
ed about the ' house. The burglar
seems to have made straight - to the
cash "repository, and immediately
left without searching for anything
else. The papers in the stolen box,
while valuable to the rightful owner,
are of no use whatever to anyone else.
They can be duplicated,, although
this may involve some expense.^ln
stead of being of any use to the
robber, they are >in the j nature of a
white elephant on his hands.' •"■ The
lady's watch > was. the only article
stolen that had any money value, and
it would be a dangerous experiment
to attempt to conveit this into cash.

AUKUM.
Dec. 9.— ln your issue \ the Ledger
of Nov. 2ath, you mention that Ama
dor county has bad her share- of
tragedies. It is a noteworthy fact j
that Amador county has not had a '
neck-stretching since so long ago that
I don't distinctly remember. It was!
1 tbink in 1859, some Chinamen were :
hung for killing a ditch tender near j
Jackson Gate. If the gallows had'
been made of lignum vita it would
have rotted down, ere this. Uz.
Fiencb, who killed Pete Wells at
Oleta 24 or 25 years ago, was afraid
of Amador, and got a change of venue
to San Joaquin. - The mistake cost
him his life, for he wa3 found guilty
there, and was hung. This state of
affairs is mostly attributable to the
able criminal lawyers that 'Amador
has had. Among the most conspicu
ous wasS. B. Ax tell, James F. barley
and a lot more.
•When Dr. Stone killed Bell in the
lobby chamber of the capital in the
early 00's, S. B. Axtell, then - of this
county, received the sum of SSOO for
simply selecting and impanelling the
jury to try the case. Dr. Stone was
cleared by A xt ell's action in the case,
although he (Axtell) acted no futher
in tbe case than merely to select the
jury. On thinking once more of
Axtell, I see a smooth shaven faced,
wiry little man, spare in build, quick
in motion and speech, with a pierc
ing black eye looking out under dark
comely eyelashes, with the Keenness
of a hawk. His speeoh,p]ain, forcible
and logical, and bis burst of elo
quence, was certain to \ arouse the
lethargic - inditfer'enco of his hearers
and quicken them into "burst, of
vociferous applause. Many times he
would tone his.voice to a low melodi
ous strain till it dropped almost to
that of a whisper. Then, as if im
pelled by some terrific force within,
would invectives : against
undue evidence and make the very
court - room ring with' rounds '■ of
applause. Once he was defending a
criminal with 'K. M. Uriggs as his
opponent. Briggs was district attor
ney, and he was making .one of bis
laborious pleas for which he was
noted. .It was anight session, and
the jury was tired, and some were
nodding in a momentary slumber.
The judge was looking vacantly down
at the stand' before him and seemed
.ill;. at ease in listening to the dry
logio of the attorney. ."Axtell nerv
ously twitched in his seat, and moved
about uneasily as if worried at the
dryness of his opponent's plea. When
finally Briggs was through, Axtell
sprang to his feet like a cat, and said
in ' a smooth, modulated silvery
tone:' "ilay it please the court,
gentlemen of tne. jury, the accom
plished district attorney's plea re
minds me of the fiery logic of an 'old
negro preacher that it was my fortune
to hear preach a sermon a long time
ago. It was summer time and one of
those star bedecked nights that is
characteristic of a summer night near
Oberlin, Ohio. The old ' negro there
fore from' choice, preached out in
open air. The congregation was an
intermixture of blacks and whites,
and the black divine broke out with
all the rural eluqueuce he could com
mand, "Bredren, he said, "de good
Lord am wid us in all his dory. See
de sta's twinklin' in ac hebens. We
ought ter gib tanks tc de Lode fur
all dis beauty roan? us." Then sud
denly, raising his hand aloft and
looking at the broad rimmed moon
peering over the tree tops, exclaimed
with negro enthusiasm, "Ain't dis er
gloris night ter kill skunks." The
jury aroused Irom the lethargy iv
which BrSgg's plea had brought them
ana roared with laughter. The judge
turned his face to the wall to hide
his levity. Axtell had the jury witb
him from then to a finish and easily
won his case.
Mrs Isaac McClary died at her resi
dence in Oleta Tuesday morning last.
Her maiden name was Jane Woody,
end she was born in Dearborn,
Michigan, in 1834. While yet in her
teens she married Isaac McClary and
shortly afterwards cam* with her
husband to the gold fields ot Cali
fornia settling in biddletown in 1853.
A half century, with its long, tedious
spinning of time, fouud husband and
wife faithfully and lovingly at their
post. Only one interval broke the
p.hain of their residence in Fiddle-
town, when Mr McClary conceived
the idea of going to New Mexico to
, engage in sheep raising, the venture
of which proved disasterous financial
ly. When he returned with his family
once more to Fiddletown, where he
re-engaged in blacksmithing, _ which
he kept up until old age of recent
years caused the two old people to
settle down in quietude and ease in
the declining years o£, their existence.
It is not an innovation to state in
tins article that the old man himself
has passed his four score and two.
The two are'linked in the inevitable
chain of fortune that held them so
long in tbe old mining camp of
Fiddletown, now Oleta. They were

BANK OF AMADOR COUNTY

Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises an area of
648 square miles. ■■' It ; lies on the wes
tern slope of Sierra Nevada mountains,
and embraces within its territory all
the diversity of valley, foothill, and
high mountainous lands.
• Climate.— The climate of the popu
lous portions of tbe county is as genial
and healthful as can be found anywhere
in California. As climate is one of the
most 'valuable assets of this favored
state in attracting* population, Amador
stands second to no county in this re
gard. It should, and no doubt will in
timei when its climatic advantages are
more thoroughly Understood and ap
preciated, become a health resort " not
only I for those in less favored states,
but for the residents of other parts of
California./ The temperature alone the
central portion rarely falls below 30
degrees ' above zero in winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees in the sum
mer. Snow seldom falls in the settled
districts, . and . never remains on the
ground for more than a few hours. Of
course, in the high j mountain regions
of eastern Amadbr the snowfall is very
heavy— which is characteristic , of the
entire Sierra Nevada ranged The sum
mer season is alway accompanied with
cool 1 nights; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs are, rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
infrequent.
' Gold Mining.— The county, although
rich in other, sources of, wealth, com
paratively untouched, is .'noted prin
cipally for:, her quartz mines. The
deepest gold mines in America tire lo
cated here. "The Kennedy mine is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
2000 feet below the surface, with every
Indication that tho pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold/ the county has contrib
uted fully $100, 000000, t0 the world's
supply of theYprecious metal. .The
mines are still yielding . at the rate of
about . two | million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
eight or ten mines operating on what
is called the "mother lode.!' stretching
clear across the county in a north-east
erly ..•direction a distance of twenty
miles. -■. The mines' aggregate between
400 and 500 stamps, and furnish^em
ployrnent for over .' 1000 miners: This
industry is 'still; in its infancy: The
unexplored 'territory,' even along the
main gold belt, is far in excess of tbe
ground ■ that". has^actually beeu i worked
•or prospected . ■ The county offers (.to
day one 'of the .most inviting fields to
i be found anywhere in the world tor the
investment of capital in the fascinating
'. business of gold mining, notalone aloug
the mother lode, but also in the almost
untouched mineralized country of the
•east belt, some ten or. twelve miles from
the main lode. -
Besides gold, .we. have copper, de
posits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
limestone, ! granite, and soapstone or
talc — all undeveloped ; !
| Agricultural Capabilities. — Theagri- 1
•cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral' riches. The valley lands
will produce anything ; that can 'bo
grown in- the most favored sections:'
la the foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetable are raised where irrigation
is practicable along the numerous water
courses. Furtherupin the mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2-500 feet, the
soil is admirably : adapted for apples
and potatoes. A ready market for
many times the quantity now raised of
these commodities can be found tin the
M^-ious mining towns.
f WLape culture and winemaking are
tiflping Important industries, 1 both I
|.y,|yg rapes and wine commanding a

Re secured for one-fourth the price
current in some places. Unimproved
lands can be had from $5 to $10 per
acre. It does not require a fortune to
buy a small ranch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agriculural pop
ulation. <-^*st tracts 'now devoted to
caUigpjttnges might be made the homes

-v Amador has a populasion of less than j
12000. Three fourths of this is concen-j
tt-ated in a strip of three miles above l
■ and below the mineral belt. .
Jackson, the County seat, has about
2-500 inhabitants, and isan incorporated
•city of the sixth class. Other towns
•are Sutter Creek, Amador City, Drv

. His friends declared that Herbert
Wyndham would one • day be recog
nized as a great artist. "Genius will
out," they insisted, grieving secretly
over the undisgulsable poverty which
clung to man and studio/ • .
j They -were jubilant ! in this' declara
tion . when Miss Ruth Greville . sat to
him for a portrait. She. was the first
butterfly who had drifted .from the
gilded realms of society unto ' the ob
scure studio in Herkimer street. \ With
her came a breath of luxury from a
■world which had long become a stran
ger to. Wyndham. ;' T ■' ■ • ' :
Her parents arranged with the artist
for her sittings. Now .and ; , then * all
three turned and looked at her, settling
between them ' : the pose in ■ which she
was to be painted. The girl herself
said little.' She appeared sweetly anx
ious to have the portrait painted ex
actly as her parents pleased. Of per
sonal vanity she seemed to have none.
Wyndhanr stirred with .keien pleasure
as he noticed her appreciative scrutiny
of his pictures. '. ' She evidently , under
stood something of Tart. . Wyndham
saw behind. the roses and lilies of her
face in its framed of curling hair a
mind' to be explored. He: was eager
to begin the ! portrait. .'
v When he did his hand was, unsteady.
To the excitement of a first profitable
order jof the kind he J had longed for
was added the excitement of painting
a face whose kindling beauty baffled
while it enchanted him. . ! .fi ■\ ;
. Some unformed . Idea .of delightful
chats about art ■ had lingered in his
mind, to be brushed aside like. a cob
web at her first sitting.". She was cold,
with a calm j serenity .which : held him
aloof as effectually as some impassable
barrier.' Nothing of haughtiness tinged
her manner. It seemed merely not to

occur to her that any social intercourse
could exist between an aristocrat of
Elmwood avenue and a dweller in this
small studio at the tbp of three flights
of dingy stairs. Her very youth took
off the sting of this Insolence of
wealth, she was so j entirely . uncon
scious of it S . '
■ , Perhaps this impalpable barrier of
reserve might have been brushed aside
to some extent had ■ Wyndham . been
less sensitive to it. | He ' met her unre
sponsiveness with like reserve, her un
communicativeness with silence.
But as he painted in the lines of her
graceful figure and the bloom of her
face grew under his hand, upon the
canvas . he was \ acutely conscious of
every lovely contour and tint, madly
rebellious that this girl, with her wide,
intellectual brow and soft, sympathetic
eyes; never vouchsafed him n . single
unnecessary word, never looked his
way with an even momentary sym
pathy. . <: ,
"Tour hair baffles me!" jhe declared
one day, ■ laying down his . brush.
Something in his tone startled her.
"Are artists always so intense?" ■ she
asked herself.
She raised her hand to the ripples of
her pale brown hair, where -golden
lights shifted and changed with j a
warm glow as alluring as it was im
possible to express. Her violet eyes
widened.
"Shall I change my position?" she
asked.
He rushed into an explanation of the
difllculty of painting light In hair. : She
looked Interested, but made no com
ment. .f. f
Wyndham caw what her observant
eyes noted every makeshift in the
studio. It hurt him to feel that she
comprehended every particle .of the
poverty of his life. This hurt the more
when, toward the last, he thought that
he surprised a look of pity in her. eyes.
He hardly expected her to tell him
at parting that she meant to send all
her friends to him to be painted be
cause he did it so beautifully. But
She did. and she kept her word. Wynd
aiam's friends said that luck had come
to him in a golden spoon. ...
To Wyndham, sitting alone in his
studio poring over a delicate sketch of
a beautiful girl with eyes of tenderest
sympathy and golden > lights in her
curling hair, luck seemed to have de
parted. All that was left to those
weeks of poignant emotion was this
AMADOBiLEPfiEB: CALIFORNIA
secret sketch of a girl whose soft eyes
looked into ■ his ' with/unVexpresslon
which the living eyes had never" worn,
this and a leaf of 'rose geranium which
she had dropped upon the floor. She
had missed it when she left, for he
saw her glance at her dress and then
about . her,; as though ' seeking some
thing. In a • little memorandum book
in an inside pocket he kept it, ', where
he could peep 'at it" whenever he jotted

zaar ' was to ,be | held, and she had
charge of the art table. . She .wanted a
picture j for , it, and she he
might contribute some little sketch. | He
promised more than that. He would
superintend [ the j erection of her stall
and decorate it himself, i She wondered
at his enthusiasm. '.When he refused
payment for, the work she was embar
rassed. •'" This had not been; what she
intended. Nor did she realize till long
afterward that a busy, artist could not

tion and decoration of the most beauti
ful booth in the bazaar, without some
pecuniary loss.' '. ■"; ■.',.' •,■-■; ;\

' Because he read her thought so well

her, he told hlmself.'.'He did not suc

upon his stairs made his heart pound

Slightly Mixed.
An Australian traveling In Japan fell
into a mixed company in which were
an English girl and an American wo^
man. He made himself agreeable to
the American at the start, she relates
in her account of "A Woman Alone In
the Heart of Japan," by remembering
that Americans are accustomed to ride
over Niagara j falls in tubs. Then he
switched to the. war of the Revolution.
"The whole thing was," he said, "that
the colonies refused to send England
troops to aid her in a foreign war, so
the motherland resolved to subdue her
naughty children."
"I guess you have confused it with
the war in Africa," said the American.
"The Boer war has been so long drawn
out you thought It was the same as the
American Revolution."
The little English girl saw there was
a misunderstanding somewhere.
"There was something about stamps
in it," she suggested meekly, "that
caused spme of the trouble."
"Something about stamps cause a
revolution?" demanded the Australian.
"Do you mean a stampede or merely
postage stamps? Did the rage for col
lecting exist in those days?"
But no one enlightened him on this,
and he was left to assort history to
suit himself. - :

\ A uniqne : monument Ito a French
astronomer's daring iucenuity is that
crowning the summit of Mont Blanc,
at ya ; height . of 15,780 feet. [ Tho
observatory of Prof. Janaseu, ' finish
ed in 1893, :ia a twc-story ; truncated
pyramid, with a base measuring 11 by
s>s yards and . double walls of ' wood
and canvas, and the structure—weigh
ing 50 tons— has no foundation/; ex
cept the permanent: snowcap of the
mountain; which is at least T.i yards
thick. To guard against settling a
rigid sub-base ; was - provided with
jaoksorews for leveling. " The ' latest
inspection' has shown a slight move
ment of the building, with practically
no settling,', and ■ the ; success J of the
remarkable experiment ■ has put , to
shame the prophets of disaster. The
observatory is visited ■ only at inter
vals of many months. ■ It nas a fine
telescope, with a two-foot mirror, for
astronom ical : work, and. a registering
meteorograph automatically | records
the barometric pressure, temperature,
humidity, and .velocity and direction
of the wind for periods of eight or
nine months at a time.', A meteoro
graph to g'ire a 'continuous record for
a much longer time 'is now being
worked out. '■' ■:. ■; ',; '■ : ,
'As an illustration of how chemistry

H.A. V Webber cites the production of
beet sugar, which has grown from a
hopeless beginning into one of the
world's; chief industries, .'yb'or one
ton of sugar, 18 tons of beets, were
required in 1836, .but roots have been
so developed by selection and analyses
that only 7^o tons were necessary ;in
189J, : and even less will suffice now.
Of the 13,000,000 tons; of sugar pro
duced in the world ) in 1905, beets
supplied 7,000,U00 tons.
Steel shot so hard, as to take the
place of diamonds for some kind of
drilling are made by spraying molten
steel into cold water, chilling, it in
stantly. * ■
When a , glass '.'cylinder! of pond
water with a' wisp of; pressed hay at
the bottom is placed iv sunshine : for
afew weeksV a reddish-violet deposit
begins at the bottom and slowly ex
tends upward.' . This deposit is marie
up' of purple bacteria, which grow
.best when a film of oil -on the water
keeps "out air, 'and , are specially re
markable for requiring much light
and little oxygen. In a recent study
of both moving and inort organisms
of this kind, Piof. H.JVlolisch has
found that if a! colony of an active
species, is placed on a microscope
slide in strong light, the. bacteria
scatter in all directions when the
observer places on the center, ot the
slide a single alga— about 1-0000 of an
inch in diameter— from the green de
posit on trees. ' Brought into the
shade, the bacteria fill the center of
the slide within half a minute. The
repulsion is due to j exhalation of an
iutiuitessimal amount of oxygen by
the alga in sunlight and serves as an
extremely delicate test for a traces of
oxygen far too minute for chemical
detection. The sensitiveness to light
as well as ' oxygen .. is marvelous.
Corkscrew-shaped bacteria brought
under . a magnifying power of \ 3UO
diameters are seen to rotate and -dart
to and fro in strong light, but cutt
ing off the illumination for a fraction
of a second ..' causes a frantic and
astonishing reversal of motion.'' ■
The to.tal number of patents taken
out in tho world since the Leginning
of patent laws is found by A. Filch,
from French statistics, to reach '2, -
500,100, of which 2,200,000 have been
granted in the last fifty years. The
government, fees have amounted to
8146,000,000, of which the United
ytates has ieceived S56,000,000; but
publication, legal study,, etc., bring
the cost up to at least 81, 000,000, 000.
Unsuccessful inventions have pro
bably brought a loss of 82,500,000,000.
.Losses from infringement suits, pro
moters, etc., are estimated to have
reached $15, W0, 000, 000 in sixty years,
and 90 per cent of patentees have
reaped little profit.
. Special schools for backward pupils
now exist in 116 German cities.
Berlin has 31 of the 203 schools, and
the total number of pupils enrolled
is not less than 13,100.
Synthetic camphor, the production
of which has been a problem among
chemists for many years, seems to be
at last a commercial product,' but the
high price of turpentine oil may .pre
vent it from coming quickly into use..
At least four processes have been de
FTinJAY. DECEMBER 13, 1901
vised for making .this . product from
pineue, which forms seventy per oeut
of turpentine oil. Hy ohemical treat
ment (and oxidation, the pinene is
given the . chemical structure and
chemical properties \of the , natural
camphor, but with different reaction
in polarized light and somewhat less
fragrance/ About ninety per cent of

ing celluloid, for which the synthetic

1 Tho visible trails left- by meteors as
they shoot across the sky have been
investigated by /Prof. C. C. '.Trow
bridge, who concludes ' that they are
clouds of Relf-lummous gas combined
with very minute particles of meteoric
dust. , As' these,; trains are usually
sent heights of 50 to 60 miles— seldom
or never above. (35 or below 45 miles,
—it : ■ appears that their formation
must depend - upon . encountering /a

GRAND JURY WORK.
The grand jury of Amador county was impanelled yester-
day, and concluded its labors the same day. There is a
feeling abroad that it is high time for this body to
make a thorough and exhaustive examination of the financial
affairs of the county; that the session will be something
more than the perfunctory affair that the people have been
accustomed to for so many years. The grand jury is a use
less appendage to our govermental system unless it acts the
part of guardian over the financial interests, and probes into
the official acts of those who have been elected •to look after
county matters. There is .no other official body directly
charged with this vitally important duty, and failure in this
respect serves to deepen the impression ' in the public mind
that the annual meeting of this body is more of a farce than
anything else. The truth is, every official body becomes a
■ farce— or something worse than a farce^ an actual peril— if
its work be left undone. The grand jury is the saving clause
injected into our system to exert a wholesome influence over
the entire machinery of local government, by indicting wrong
doers in officialdom, . and placing the seal of condemnation
upon extravagance and dereliction of duty in all its manifold
forms. From this standpoint the expense that it entails
cv.en by a thorough-paced session, is not worthy of compari
son with the good that would be accomplished ,by faithful
service. We believe there never has been a time when a gen
eral shaking up of county affairs was more in order than
now. Further, the people are practically a unit in demand
ing that a move in this direction be made, free from partisan
ship and governed by disinterested motives. Arid from one
end of the county to the other the inquiry is being made:
•' Will it be done ?".. Wo<
Though the columns of the Ledger there has been pointed
out from time to tiine'some things that savor very strongly
of misgovernment— to use a mild term. They might with
advantage be made the subject of investigation, which might
lead the way to other matters that require probing and. con
cerning which, perhaps nothing has come to light. The
members of the grand jury could hardly.be expected to carry
on such an examination alone; probably few of their number
are qualified for the task, and that is saying nothing in dero
,gation of their competency las grand jurors. It takes some
thing more than an expert accountant to do the work as it
should be done. Indeed, to compare the receipts and expenses
and to ascertain that the suihs received and paid out ■ and on
hand balance, is not the most important part of the work.
No one would expect that any grave discrepancies would be
unearthed as the outcome of such financial experting. As a
rule, the slight clerical errors or oversights which are usu
ally brought to light by the up-to-date accountant, and the
long-drawn-out report in which they are set forth, are not
not worth the monej' expended in their, elaborate unravel-^
merit. But it by uo means follows that because the books of
account are fairly accurate, that therefore the local-govern
ment as a whole is without blemish. It requires a man posted
in the law, and not a mere figurer, to dive into -the by-paths
of ccunty ■ management and adequately size up the situation.
What is wanted at this time is an investigation into the bills
allowed, to see whether they conform to established rates or
not; to look into the peculiar manner of fixing up proposals
for bids for supplies which have prevailed .for many years;
of the failure to call for bids at all where the law provides
"that a contract for certain supplies must be made with the
lowest bidder; of the consequent allowance of claims in open
defiance of law; of the ringing in of salary claims month
after month and year after year, when the law provides that
the same should be per diem charges at so much for eight
hours work and properly itemized; the mode of procedure in
road word and the payment of claims therefor; the absence
of any local law providing for the keeping of a proper record
book relating to one of the most important branches of county
revenue, and how a wholesome provision on the subject came
to be wiped from the ordinance. We venture to say that
these and doubtless other topics might furnish a chapter of
much interest to those who have borne, and are still bearing
the financial burden of government on an apparently endless
scale of progression. Oh, no; the grand jury is -anything,
but a fifth-wheel-to-a-wagon affair.

District attorney Langdon, and his voluble assistant Fran
cis J. Heney would appear to much better advantage in their
efforts to purify San Francisco if they would attend strictly
to their official duties, instead of lecturing all over the coun
try trying to prejudice the public mind against the graft de
fendants. A blabbing district attorney, denouncing a de
fendant from the rostrum, is hardly in accord with the Amer
ican idea of fair play. Civic righteousness is greatly to be
desired, official righteousness is equally desirable. A public
prosecutor endeavoring to create a prejudice outside against
one awaiting trial, advertises himself in the role of a perse
cutor.
The republican national committee has selected June 16th
as the time for) holding the national convention, and Chicago
as the place. That Chicago ]won easily against Kansas City is
interpreted by some,as a set-back to the administration forces,
but it is improbable if any issue was joined on that score.
President Roosevelt has again announced that under no cir
cumstances will he be [a candidate.

Beware of Ointments for Catarrh that
contain Mercury .... -
as mercury will surely destroy thesense
of smell and ■ completely derange the
whole system when entering It through
the mucous surfaces. Such articles
should' never. be used except on pre
scriptions from reputable physicians, as
the damage they will do is ten-fold to
the good yon can, possibly derive' from
them. Hall's Catarrh Cure, manufac
tured by F. J. Cheney & -Co., Toledo
0., contains no mercury, and; is taken
internally, acting directly upon^ the
blood and mucous surfaces of the sys
tem. In buying Hall's Catarrh Cure
be sure you get , the genuine.' It is
taken internally, and made in Toledo,

Train Went" Back
Eight Miles.
An incident occurred on the Ama
dor branch /ailroad between Gait and
lone last week, that has been various
ly interpreted, . and Which it is not
out •■• of place to . explain. >. xhe -up
train on Wednesday started ou its
trip to lone, and on reaching Conley,
the ilrst station from Halt, and fully
seven miles out, was, halted and on
receipt of a dispatch . went all the
■way back to Gait for . half a dozen
passengers that had beeu left at the
terminus there. Three passengers
happened (to be Japanese, who were
bound tor lone. /The idea got abroad
somehow that the fourteen or fifteen
mile extra trip was made in defer
ence to these Japs, and that it was
another case of America bowing - be
fore the little hrgwn .men ot the
Orient, but it was nothing, of the
sort.' 'l'he return trip was not made
in consideration of them particularly.
I'he truth is, 'the train pulled out of
Gait without stopping at the passenger
waiting room; 'as is . required to be
done. -The ., six passengers were left
behind in that way. One .of : the
passengers was a brother ot one of
the victims' of the Fremont mine
disaster, ■ who had come' all the way
from Utah and wanted .'■ to , reach the
scene of the accident ;as i soon 'as
possibe. Another passenger was a
lady/ who, was "on her ■• wayto~ ( Oleta
to attend the funeral ot ' her mother.
Now when.. they ; found v themselves
left at Halt, without as they claimed
any fault of their,' own," they . said
they would report the matter to the
tieaquarters -of the railroad, unless
the matter was -set right. :„ To
straighten/ the atfair out, the con
ductor, on reach iug Cotiley, ; conclud
ed to travel f buck ' to the ,'etaiting
point, and pick up the six passengers
who had come on the west' bound
train from 1 Sacramento, 'and were
waiting for : the lone train to take
them aboard.". That is all there is to
it. It is not another- example of
falling before the Oriental race.

Mrs. Boyson Dies
From Meningitis:
Mrs Boyson, wife of .". Dr. , Thomas
Boyson of Plymouth, died early "yes-|
terday morning at their home in that
place .; after an illness '. covering '* a
period ,of about seven weeks'. *;*; * The
immediate cause of l " her Jdeath was
cerebel meningitis, or iuflamation of
the membranes of ■ the brain. ;! She
was taken with this disease . about
two weeks ago. and was expected to
pass away at almost any minute, but
the iuflamation went down slightly so
that she was somewhat improved, but
the - strain had been altogether too
great. She had taken 110 nourish
ment to speak of during the entire
time.
A great many hearsay, reports have
been current iv Plymouth as to the
cause bt hex. illness. ' It seems that
they had a quarrel about .the '^ tenth
of October and the next 'day she ;ap'^
peared "on; the; streets ; with ;a',tery
swollen and discolored eye. v " ./.She .is
reported as laying to;a neighbor, thajt
he had struck her. Besides' this there
are many other rumors afloat.;
Dr.- Boyson being an eye specialist
treated his wife until; she became so
ill,' when he called in. Dr. / Norman*,
a practicing physician of Plymouth.'
When 'sheriff Gregory and district
attorney Vicihi ; spoke to? him [at the
charge that had been *oade':by^ some
of the people of that", town,^botb
doctors insisted that they^oall inT the^
county physician, which 4 was ; done."
This was a we^ek' ago Monday." .But
doctor Endicott could -'plainly; see.
that it was cerebal meningitis, but it
was not for him to say what the cause
of it might he,- for this oomes from
various reasons. Yesterday afternoon
an inquest was held;; but it was not
thought necessary to bold an autopsy.
Testimony was Haken ; in , the after-,
noon, and an evening cession was
held, while they came together, again
this morning, the jury fringing
verdict about noon L of . death .; from
causes unknown. Seven or eight
witnesses were called.
