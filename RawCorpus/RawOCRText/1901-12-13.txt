Preparing For a Journey.
JerouiP K. Jerome recalls, vrith
reverence, a habit of his iir.-tlin.cUra]
uncle who, before packing for a jour
ney, always "made a list.'". This -.vas
the system which he followed, gather
ed from his uncle's owu lips:
Take a piece of paper nnd put down
on It everything you can possibly re
quire. Then go over It and sec tliai it
contains nothing yon can possibly <lo
without
-Imagine yourself in bed. What have
you got on? Very well; put it -down,
together with a change. , You K«'t uj>
What do you do? Wash yourself.
What do you wash yourself wlih?
Soap. Put down soap. Go on (ill you
bave finished. Then take your riot lies.
Begin at your feet What do you w-cnf
on your feet? Boots, shoes, socks Put
them down. Work up till you gel to
your head. What do yon want licsldes
clothes?; Put down everything. _._-...

ways pursued. The list made, be would

Borrowing Habits of Poets.
: On Tennyson's habit of failing to
recognize clearly his own borrowings
from the classical poets, Mr. Lang ob
serves that the poets have always had
a kind of ' regal Indifference to their
own lighter productions. Mr. Laug
says: "Scott did not care; no, not when
be found that he had unwittingly taken
a line from a poem by the valet of a
friend. In the preface to a little col
lection of verses from the novels he
frankly declares that be cannot pretend
to bo certain which are of his own com
position and which are not
j "To take an example from the level
at the foot of Parnassus, I once redd,
in an American paper, some lines at
tributed to Mr. Austin Dobson. 'Not
bad for Dobson,' I said freely to a
friend. But it was proved on me that
the rhymes were my own! A bard who
forgets his own verses may be par
doned for remembering those of other
people and mistaking a half line of
somebody else's for his own. . I dare
say that Tennyson did this occasion
ally, but he could hardly say that 'the
sun sets' without being accused of un
conscious borrowing."
George's Father.
Augustine Washington, the father of
George Washington, was engaged in
1732 in making pig iron at Accokeek
furnace, in Stafford county, Va., about
fifteen miles from Fredericksburg,
when his famous son was born. This
furnace had been built by the Princl
pio company, composed of English cap
italists, as early as 1726, on land owned
by Augustine Washington, aggregating
about 1,600 acres and containing Iron
ore, Mr. Washington becoming the
owner of one-sixth of the furnace prop
erty in consideration of the transfer of
his land to the company.
In my opinion t!" man who kills his
fellow is the hero of barbarism; tbe
man who risks his own life to save
the lives of others is the only hero that

'.'Many years ago," says the Provi
dence Journal, "in a village not 20
miles from Providence a revival was in
progress. A young man, one of Indis
tinguishable twin brothers who had
previously been observed, as was sup
posed, in an attentive attitude nt the
meeting, rose for prayers,' walked to
the anxious seat, and there walled and
n-.oa.ned to such good purpose that the
deacons were sure he was on tbe high
road to salvation.
The next day he was overheard In
the back yard at home chopping wood
and swearing painfully at a refractory
leg. When remonstrated with for bis
sudden backsliding, be merely said.
"Oh, brother Jim couldn't go to the
meeting last night, so I went and hol
lered for him."

ANCIENT UMBRELLAS
THEY FIGURED IN CHURCHES JN THE
. EARLY CHRISTIAN DAYS. ■
When First Adopted by the Pnbllc,
1 They Seem to Have Been Utilised
Solely; cs Snn Protectors— Once an
Attribute ol Dignity.
In the early Christian churches a
large umbrella usually hung over the
priest, and -it• is said that from this
custom it became one of the attributes
of cardinals appointed from basllican
churches. For . years . the doges of
Venice carried umbrellas of state, and
in 12SS Pope Alexander 111. declared
that these should be surmounted by
golden statuettes of the annunciation.
: Michael Moroslni was the first Vene
tian layman to carry an umbrella,
which consisted of a small; flat square
of green stuff, over which was a cop
per spiral. Soon after the umbrella
was. adopted by -fashionable Venetian
dames. According to Coryat's "Crudi
ties" (1C11), the Italian umbrella was
a small canopy and was made of leath
er extended by a series of wooden
hoops. He says umbrellas were used
by horsemen, who, resting the handles
on the thigh as they rode, bore them'
so that they should "minister shadow
unto them for shelter against the
scorching sun."
In the Hiirleian manuscripts, now in
the British museum, there Is In manu
script . No. GO3 a crude illustration
showing the figure of a yoeman hold
ing an umbrella over his lord, which
leads me to infer that umbrellas were
known In England even In the early
Anglo-Saxon period.
Beck, as quoted in the Draper's Dic
tionary, asserts that at the time that
Stephen usurped the crown of England
(twelfth century) umbrellas were in
common use among the English. The
first mention of the umbrella In Eng
lish literature is in Florio's "World of
Wonders" (1598), where It is described
as a "kind of round fan dr shadowing
that they use to ride with In summer
In Italy; a little shade."
In 1C56 an umbrella was exhibited in
tbe "Museum Tradescantlanum; or,
Collection of Rarities Preserved at
South Lambeth, Near London, by John
Tradescant," which was known as
"one of the wonders of the ark."
In the church of Cartmell, In Lanca
shire, England, there was preserved
until a few years ago an umbrella said
to be over 300 years- old, which was
used chiefly to protect the host
References to the umbrella are to be
found also in Blouut's "Glossographla"
(1C74) and Phillips' "New Worlde of
Words" (ICVS). In the first the refer
ence reads: "Unibrello, a fashion of
round and broad fans) wherewith the
Indians (and from them our great ones)
preserve themselves from tbe heat of
the sun,- aud hence any little shadow,
fan or other thing wherewith the wom
en guard their faces from the sun."
The second runs: "Umbrello, a screen
against the sun's beat, used chiefly by
the Spaniards, among whom it Is known
by tbe name quitasole."
The imaginative Dean Swift In the
"Tale of a Tub" (1C0C) depicts Jack, an
ever resourceful type, making use of a
parchment copy of his father's will as
a nightcap when he went to bed and as
an umbrella in rainy weather. Did
the worthy Hanway take his cue from
this or from Kersey, according to whom
the umbrella was a "broad fan or
screen commonly used by women to
shelter them from rain?" The last ref
erence, made In 1709, Is the first men
tion of it as a protector from the rain.
Later Bailey, who in his dictionary
(1737) called it a parasol,' defined it as
"a sort of small canopy to keep off the
rain." . .
Small, light umbrellas came into
fashion among the ladles of the French
court In 1675, and these were carried
by attendants. Richelet tells us that
they were made of oilcloth or leather
and had ribs of whalebone. A century
later they found favor with the men,
who carried red umbrellas, with edges
fringed with gold lace.
The precise date when Jonas Han
way, who died in 1786, introduced the
umbrella Into England Is not recorded
in any of the encyclopedias I have at
hand, but they all state that he wag
popularly known as Its Introducer.
.With the Dutch, as with the Indian
grandees, the umbrella was first an at
tribute of dignity, and well it might
be, for the prices paid for them at The
Hague in 1600 ranged from $75 to $120
each. The Dutch colonists who settled
at the Cape of Good Hope were not
slow to insist on preserving the dignity
of the umbrella, for Ryk van Tulbagh,
governor of Oape Colony in 17.12. en
acted that "No one less in rank than
a junior merchant or those among the
citizens of equal rank, and the wives
and daughters only of those who are or
have been members of any council
shall venture to use umbrellas, and
those who are less In rank than mer
chants shall not enter the castle lv fine
weather with an open umbrella."—

THE VARIED RESULTS OF REARRANG-
ING THE FURNITURE.

Mrg. Blnnk'n Mania For ChunKins

Drought Trouble to the Mule Con-
tingent and Sorrow to Herself.
"Do you change the position of the
furniture when you clean a room?"
Inquired housewife No. 1 of a friend in
the course of a heart to heart talk.
"Do I? Why, yes, indeed! I don't
feel as If the room Is cleaned unless I
change the furniture a little bit. Do
you?"
"Well, I usually change the orna
ments around nnd so forth, but in the
spring and fall I like to change every
thing In a room— completely alter the
whole appearance of It. Then I fancy
the things are all new, and they seem
to look prettier somehow. But, do you
know, my husband doesn't like It at
all!"
"Neither does mine! Isn't that singu
lar? Men are so peculiar!"
"Yes, iudced they are!"
- So many housekeepers share the
views of these two that a story with
a moral will not be out of place.
It was the other night only that Mr.
Blank went unsuspiciously up stairs to
bed at an unusually early hour, leaving
his wife reading In the sitting room.
He had a headache and carried a gob
let of water In bis right hand. Fear
lessly advancing into the dark bed
room Mr. Blank suddenly felt both legs
violently cut from under him. He
clutched wildly at. the air and -said
several tilings of an exclamatory na
ture, but there was nothing to save
him. He went down.
"Good gracious, Henry!" ejaculated
Mrs. Blank, hurrying to tbe scene of
disaster. "What is j tbe matter?
Where are you? Why don't you light
the gas?" Suiting the action to the
word, she beheld her husband sprawl-
Ing across the bed; the glass he bad
carried had discharged Its contents
across the pillowshams and shivered on
the floor.'
: Mr. Blank did the talking for the
next ten minutes. He said that of nil
the blankety blank folly of which the
mind could conceive this of changing
furniture around was the worst. He
said it was a pretty thing for a man to
walk Into his' own room and have to
fall over thugs In the dark. He said
he wouldu stand It; the "furniture
must be replaced where it formerly
stood.
"1 shan't do anything of the kind,"
replied Mrs. Blank. "It looks very
much nicer where It is. Why don't
you feel where you are going when you
get into a dark room?"
"S'pose you'd like me to crnwl In. on
all fours!" snarled Mr. Blank. "I
couldn't feel where the bed was unless
I happened to touch the footboard. I
thought I could walk clear over to the
bureau. 1 tell you It's a confounded
crank yon have on this subject. Some
day you'll precipitate "a "serious acci
dent."
"If any one precipitates, it'll be you,
I should think," retorted Mrs. Blank
icily. And the furniture remained
where it was.
It was the next evening that Master
Blank undertook to carry a pile of
schoolbooks from the dining room to
the sitting room. He had a bottle of
ink in his hand, and he thought he
knew exactly where the center table
was. In the course of his peregrina
tions in search of It, however, he came
into vloieut collision with tho glass
door of the bookcase, which he broke.
There were also inky traces discernible
on the carpet when Mrs. Blank came
in. This time there was some balm for
her feelings. She could spank Master
Blank and did it with tbe best will in
the world.
Her own downfall was not long In
coming, however, although for 1 a few
days only minor inconveniences were
met with, such as the abrasion of an
kles against chair rockers and slight
bruises received by means of sudden
contact with unforeseen obstacles. Last
evening Mrs. Blank undertook to trans
fer the cage of her pet parrot from the
window where It spends the day to tbe
snug corner where It passes the night
She did not trouble to light the gas, and
by some unaccountable mental lapse
she had forgotten the precise point at
which a tabouret, on which stood a Jar
diniere, was stationed. She charged
into the tabouret with considerable
force, was overbalanced by tbe weight
of the cage in her arms and took a
header with a resounding crash. The
parrot shrieked, and, unable to distin
guish friend from foe, inflicted a severe
bite on her mistress* finger. Mr. Blank
came In hurriedly, picked up his wife
and assisted in making an Inventory of
sundry contusions. Then they lifted
the parrot cage, badly bent, and tbe
jardiniere with a piece chipped out of
It and the tabouret somewhat scratch
ed, and then Mr. Blank observed quiet
ly:
"I have just one thing to ask you,
Mrs. Blank. Was I right?"
"No, you were not!" retorted Mrs.
Blank savagely. "Serious accident?
What's serious about this, I should like
to know? For goodness' sake, Henry,
don't stand there trying to look like a
martyrt If you must have the furni
ture moved back, I'll move It!" And
she did.— Philadelphia Record.

"Why do you speak so slightingly

"I didn't mean to speak slightingly

Health and Beauty.
A poor complexion is usually the re
sult of a torpid liver or irregular action
of the bowels. Unless nature's refuse
is carried off it will surely cause impure
blood. Pimples, boils and other erup
tions follow. This is nature's method
of throwing off the poisons which the
bowels failed to remove. De Witt's
Little Early_ Risers are world famous
for remedying this condition. They
stimulate the liver and promote regular
and healthy action of the bowels but
never cause griping, cramps or dis
tress. Safe pills. Kerr's Pharmacy,"

AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY.
A Series of Order* That Rejuvenated
the Ailing Slaves.
A correspondent sends the following
story of an old Virginia gentleman:
Some years before the war a gentle
man of large landed Interests counted
among his possessions a plantation on
the James river, an estate of consider
able dimensions. Other Interests kept
him away from the old place for some
years, during which time there was a
marked decrease In the revenue. Upon
his return to the plantation he discov
ered that many of the slaves were laid
up with "rheumatism and other miser
ies, the farming implements were in
bad order and the old homestead was
fast going to rack and ruin. Calling
his overseer he said:
I "Anderson, I notice a great many old
wagons, plows and harrows about
the place. Have them brought and
piled In front of the house, and on
Monday next order all the niggers on
the place to be present"
At the .appointed time they came.
The pile was set on fire and the Imple
ments destroyed. The following week
he called the overseer's attention to the
sick and infirm horses, hogs and cattle
and gave the same order. When the
negroes had assembled all the animals
were knocked in the head. The Fri
day following the landlord again called
his overseer.
"Anderson, I see a great many sick
niggers around here— many who seem
to be laid up with rheumatism and are
good for nothing. Give orders that on
Monday morning nt 10 o'clock they all
appear in the front yard."
The effect on the slaves was magical.
On Saturday men who had been un
able to walk were skipping around like
children; the sick grew well suddenly,
and from that time on the plantation
was most prosperous. — Exchange.

FOOD OF AMERICANS.
An English Woman Tells of the
Strange Things She Ate Here.
An English woman who visited Amer
ica a short time ago'has been telling
her country women about the "strange
food across the water." Of course she
discovered green corn, but she had been
prepared for that. Oyster crabs were
quite new to her.
'•They look like-Boston baked beans,"
she explains, "but they taste much bet
ter."
An oyster cocktail filled her with awe
and enthusiasm. She tried it at Del
monico's and thought it was soup. Of
course In England one didn't serve
soup in a glass; but, then, neither did
the English serve boiled eggs in a
glass. One could never be sure of
Americans.
Of canvasback duck she has v poor
opinion, but thinks she might like it
better if Americans would have it cook
ed or even warmed. As for terrapin,
she sings Its praise. She found It much
like calf's bead, and she always liked
calf s head. Shades of Maryland gour
mets, what a slur is there!
"All the puddings in America are pie
or Ice cream," she says, but It must be
understood that pie does not mean
game pie. The Yankee pie is a tart
and is übiquitous, she explains.
She sat next to an American man
who ate a lump of cheese with his
strawberry pie and turned a plateful of
ice cream over both, but she doesn't
know that that is a general custom.
The oysters were good, buUhad most
impossible names, and the cockles
(meaning clams) are excellent. On the
whole, Yankee food and cooking are
good, but there Is too much of the food
011 the table at one time. — New York

Letter From Alaska.
Circle City, October 22.
Editor of the Ledger: —
Slow but sure! here I am at last
writing a few lines to my many Jack
son friends through your paper. After
having met my partners, Peter Zellor
and Carl Mack ie, in San Francisco, we
immediately proceeded to buy our three
years' outfit for Alaska, and decided
that one of us should accompany the
freight— of which we had six ton— via
Seattle, Nome, St. Michaels, and up
the Yukon to Circle City, and the
other two to go by rail to Seattle, and
from tfiero, via' Skagaway, Dawson,
down the Yukon. I was chosen to ac
company the freight and take the
longer routo, via Nome. So after a
stormy voyage of six days, arrived
in Seattle on the 6th day of June, 1901.
On going ashore, I did not walk half a
block before I met my Jackson friend,
S: Pauloy, also on his way to Circle
City, but delayed there on account of
his hydraulic outfit not having arrived
from San Francisco. Wo spent a
pleasant evening together. Next
morning I met my partners, French
Pete and Charley Mackie. They hav
ing arrived the day before my arrival.
The steamer St. Paul, of which I was
a passongor. had to call at Seattle for
passengers and freight, I was astonish
ed at tho business activity in Seattle.
For its size, it almost beats San Fran
cisco, and some things are cheaper than
in B'risco. We left Seattle at noon;
Pauley and my partners were at the
wharf to bid me adieu.
On the 16th of June we arrived at
Unalaska to take a supply of coal, and
the 24th of June found us anchored
within one mile and a half of Nome.
We arrived at 6 o'clock in the evening,
but most of the passengers were not
landed until the next day. Shortly
after our arrival I sat down to write
letters, which I intended to mail in
Nome the next day. When I had fin
ished writing I looked at nay watch; it
was a few minutes after one o'clock in
the morning, and I was writing all the
time without any light, as it is day
light for weeks about that time of the
year. As I left the smoking room,
whore I was writing, a surpriso awaited
me In the shapo of a sunrise. In all
my life I never saw such a beautiful
sunrise as that just coming up behind
tho mountains of Nome. Tho sky was
a mass of burning gold, horo and there
shaded with brilliant colors. I forgo!)
letters and everything, and just stopped
there for 10 or 15 minutes. And this
was about tho only attractive and beau
tiful thing I'vo seen in Nome. I made
up my mind to have a good look at the
town after breakfast. At 9 o'clock I
stepped ashore in Nome, and found the
streets crowded with people and cover
ed with deep mud. Weather was cold
and windy, and about noon a drizzling
rain came, which made it even more
disagreeable. Apparently everybody
was busy, as they were rushing by each
other in a hurry. Gambling houses
and saloons were also doing a little
business, but I could see only a little
mining, and that I found as I was
walking along the beacK.
■ About a mile apart were two men
with rockers and one group of three
men with one rocker, which was stand
ing in a holo about 10 feet deep, where
some water had gathered. At the
rocker stood an elderly gentleman with
pleasant and friendly manners. His
two partners were about 15 or 20 feet
away, shoveling some fine sandy gravol
into two buckets, which they carried
to the rocker when filled. The rocker
had amalgam plates, and as I could
see no ri files nor canvass I asked him
how he managed to save his coarse
gold, and he said there was none.
What little there is left in the beach
sand is as fine as flour. 1 asked him
how it paid. "Well!" he said, "yes
terday we made $10 between the three
of us." I thought to myself, there are
better diggings In Amador county. ■ I
went back to the crowded streets again,
trying to find somebody from Amador
county, probably Dan Murphy or Geo.
Poggi, but Nome Is big and I did not
succeed in finding anybody. I was told
that they expected the ground to thaw
out in two weeks, when everybody
would rush to the creeks, but it was
longer than two weeks before It thawed
out, as It was freezing In Nomo on the
fourth of July. \ \''"
And what a barren country around
Nome; not a tree in sight, not oven
enough wood to cook a meal on the
trails. The good ground is all staked
within 250 miles of Nome, and If a now
comer really would find anything
worth having, he'd be swindled
out of it, as so many have been. To
wards evening I went aboard the St.
Paul again, glad to get away from
Nome. Even business is overdone in
all Its branches.
We sailed the next morning, accom
panied by a strong and cold wind, and
rain. Although it is only 18 hours
travel from Nome to St. Michaels, we
were not landed there until the sth of
July, having ran across a lot of float
ing ice, and within 5 miles of St.
Michaels everything was frozen solid.
St. Michaels is an island under U. S.
military rule, and the only business
places there are the steamphip com
pany's wharves, warehouses, stores,
and hotels. The military barracks are
put up neat and comfortable. During
my stay In St. Michaels I met Dr. and
Mrs. Hatch, and we had quite a long
chat about Jackson. The doctor was
attired in army surgeon's uniform.
There was also a sad accident jlu ring
my stay there. [On the trip from San
Francisco I goj acquainted with -a
party of six men!; 011 their way to Nor
ton . Sound, sixty miles from St.
Michaels, amongst whom was a young
man, Hershel Elder, from Vlsalia, Cal.,
a very pleasant fellow of 25 years.
The only fault he had was that be
gambled once in a while on the steamer
Ten Cents Per Copy.
St. Paul. We all had uTwait in St.
Michaels ior our freight to be unload
ed, and these prospectors put up their
tents withinji mile from the town. On
Monday, the Bth of July, whenjEldeTs
partner (a Mr. Hitchcock", also from
Visulia) returned to the tent in the
evening, ho found Horshel Elder on the
ground with a bullet hole in his head,
and dead. Whother it was suicide or
accident no one could tell. He left a
mother in Vhalia, who thought more
of that boy of hers than of her life.
His partner, Hitchcock, wont to the
military authorities to have him buried,
but they would have nothing to do
with it as he was no soldier. Finally,
after much running around, he got
permission from the deputy marshal to
dig a grave in the burying ground, so
Hitchcock told us about it, and four of
us borrowed picks and shovels from
tho Alaska C. Co., and went the fol
lowing "afternoon to dig the grave.
We dug in a solid mass of frozen
ground and ice, four feet. It took four
of us all afternoon. In the evening
at 8 o'clock, a small party of about
twelve of us assembled, and we carried
the poor follow to his cold resting place.
An elderly gentleman by the name of
Cone, also from Visalia, held a short
but impressive service, and as we stood
there, with our hats in hand, saying a
short prayer, I thought, that was one
of tho saddest funerals I've ever at
tended. On our way we picked up a
post 12x12, painted white. This we
put at the head of the grave, and I
printed with an indelible pencil,
"Hershel S. Elder of Visalia, Cal., died,
July 8, 1901, aged 25." I heard since
that his remains will be taken to
Visalia this fall.
St. Michaels was another place I
was glad to get away from. Every
thing is very dear. Hotels charge $4
per day; coffee and doughnuts, 50
cents, etc. So just as soon as they put
my freight on board of the "Susie"
(it cost a lot of urging) I took my ticket
for Circle City, and left St. Michaels
on the 11th "of July.
The trip up tho Yukon was very
pleasant, and the scenery is beautiful.
The further up the river we went, the
warmer the weather got.
I was landed in Circle City, freight
and all, on the 22d of July,' where my
partners had boon waiting for me
nearly a month. This is a typical
northern mining town, and the~*build
ings'are all built of logs. Wagon
roads, we have none, and the trails are
all wet and swampy in summer, and
mosquitoes as thick as the dust in July
on tbe lone road. Traveling and haul
ing provisions are better in winter,
when the s tramps and everything is
frozen solid. We had the . first snow
fall on tho Ist of October, and it gets
quite cold now.
On tho 12th of September the steam
er "Susie" arrived on one of her trips
from St. Michael, and whom should I
see on her but George Poggi, on his
way from Nome to Dawson. He look
ed well, and as happy as a lark. He
said that his next trip will be to South
Africa.
We wont out on a week's trip int«
the country to look at a place where
wo intond to sink to bedrock this
winter. We packed about 35 lbs each
on our backs, slept out in the open,
and did our own cooking all the way.
I found the trails very hard to get
over, and we did an awful lot of pre
spiring. When we came home I found
my pants about throe sizes too large
around the waist. ' On our trip we shot
17 ducks, two grouse, two tree squirrels,
and caught about two dozen -big trout.
This was in the early part of Septem
ber, and still in the mornings when we
woke up we found quite heavy frost on
our blankets.
To tell the truth, since I have been
here several times I have been real
homesick after my little Jackson candy
factory. This lifo i 3 rougher than
what I thought it was, but then I am
here now, and will try my hardest "to
stick it out the three years, and when
I leave here and after landing in Frisco,
my first trip will be to Jackson, where
I hope I will find my many good friends
in tbe best of health. Will make tha
old lone stage stop in front of the
Sanguinetti building. Meanwhile I
wish all Jackson a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year.
My partner, Peter Zellor, and also S.
Panley wish to be remembered to their
Amador county friends; and I remain,
Yours truly,
Ferdinand Mayeb.

R. WEBB - '•''-'- Editor and Manager
FRIDAY DECEMBER 13, 1901
A CURIOUS PROPOSITION.
Some of our democratic exchanges
are making a despairing effort to
show that the republican "party is
veering round to the principles of
the democracy in r<\ j ird to the tariff.
Because some republicans, in view
of the surplus revenue, and the uni
versal prosperity of trade condi
tions, favor a readjustment of the
tariff, therefore they argue there is
practically little difference between
this proposed revision and the demo
cratic doctrine of a "tariff for rev
enue only, with incidental protec
tion. " Democratic editors are chary
about enlarging upon this pet phrase
and telling in plain language what
is meant thereby. Any duty, no
I matter how small, levied upon im
ported manufactured articles, is to
the extent of that duty a protection
to the home manufacturer in the
same line of goods. The protection
is an incident of, and inseparable
from the tariff. If wages were as
low, and other costs of production
the same, as in the country from
which the dutiable articles are ship
ped, the freight charges and the
duty, however snail, would consti
tute a sufficient margin for the suc
cessful competition of the American
manufacturer. To provide revenue,
however, is the only justification for
a tariff, according to democratic no
itions. A' horizontal tariff, so much
per cent of the value of the articles
imported, is their simplest and most
ideal method of a tariff system, re
gardless of whether the incoming
goods become a disturbing factor in
home industries or not. Under this
system', as importations increased,
the lower the tariff was -reduced,
because the revenue from this source
would correspondingly increase with
the growth of the imports. So the
competition between the foreign and
home made products would grow
keener, to the disadvantage of do
mestic manufacturers and the dis
tress of American labor. Thus a
tariff for revenue with incidental
protection, means no protection at
all. It has been tried repeatedly,
and tried long enough to thoroughly
test its inapplicability to the indus
trial conditions in this country. It
has always resulted in business ca
lamity, making capitalists shrink
from investment owing to lack of
confidence. . A . depleted treasury
has ever been the result, as vast
sums were annually driven out of
circulation iv payment for foreign
made articles. True, the importa
tions under this system never reach
ed the proportions that might be ex
pected, as compared with importa
tions under a strictly protective
tariff, because the working classes
being distressed from scarcity of
employment, were without the means
■ to buy, and were compelled to forgo
many things within their reach in
mofe prosperous circumstances.
Incidental protection with a tariff
for. revenue only is a democratic
phrase designed to tickle the ears of
the laboring masses with the idea of
cheap living. In practice, however,
it depletes the pockets of the toilers,
and leaves them stranded in a land
of plenty as the penalty of bad
On the other hand* the republican
policy is to discriminate in tariff
duties; placing, heavy imposts on
articles that are or can be made
here, and light duties on such as
cannot be produced here. Under
this system the trade of the country
has grown enormously, until it now
ranks first among the nations. Not
only bur domestic consumption, but
our foreign commerce has developed
amazingly, competing at the present
time in the markets of free trade
Great Britain. It may be asked,
how is it that a tariff intended to
keep out importations from the
poorly paid labor countries, enables
the United States to compete in
many lines with those very countries
on their own ground. This is not
such a formidable question as it ap
pears, but it would take too much
space to answer it at this time. We
reserve it for a future occasion.
The painted hands -upon the paint
ed wooden clocks imd watches used
as jewelers' signs throughout the
United States with few exceptions
point to 8:18 o'clock. It is not gen
erally known that this is the hour
that President Lincoln was assassi
nated and that this almost universal
custom of painting clocks is in com
memoration of the life and death of
the martyred president. A move
ment is now on foot by the Jewelers'
Association of the United States to
have this changed to the hour and
minute when President McKinley
received the assassin's, bullet, name
ly, 3:55. This will probably be ac
complished. — Ex.

AUKUM.
- AUKUM, Dec. B.— Tho entertainment
given at the Pigeon Creek school on
tho closing of the turm was a decided
success. The program was well sus
tained by the actors, both juveniles aud
adults, and was received with appreci
ation by the large audienco. After tho
entertainment a dance was given, tho
net proceeds to go towards paying for
a school organ. The net sum made
paid the balance due on tho organ, a
portion having already been paid from
the proceeds of a similar entertainment
last fall. The dance was well attended,
and passed off pleasantly and in an
orderly manner. Miss Vogeli. the pop
ular teacher, retires for the winter,
going to the homo of her mother in
Sacramento. We compliment the
Oleta boys on their generosity in at
tending the ball in quite a good num
ber, thereby aiding the laudable pur
pose of tho dance. ~

Grand Jury ■ Seport.
To the Hon. R. C. Rust, judge of the
superior court of Amador county, Cal.
We," the grand jury of Amador coun
ty, impanelled on the 6th day of Decom
bor, beg leave to submit the following
report:
Tho iirst thing wo did was to iuquire
from tho district attorney of any crimi
nal cases for tho grand jury to 'investi
gate., but found that all were properly
attended.
We counted tho money in tho treas
ury, tho same being $09840.90, which
amount corresponds with the report of
the county auditor.
We have examined as close as pos
sible in such short tirao, the books in
both the clerk's ami recorder's office,
also tho sheriff's office, and found them
to be kept in tho most neat and busi
ness-like manner, and all correct.
We found the county hospital kept
iv a most creditable condition. The
patients are fifty-eight, and all aro sat
isfied of the treatment of tho present
manager.
Wo also visited tho county jail, and
found it as clean as tho place can bo
kept, and_ believe that the sanitary
condition is very good; there are at
present eleven prisoners.
We visited the basement used for
the purpose of keeping trial juries at
night, and found it entirely inadequate
for the purpose intended.
In regard to the proper protection
and preservation of the county build
ings, which is ono of the important
duties of the supervisors, wo urge upon
that body the imperative necessity of
having • tho ■ court house and hall of.
records painted on tho outside, as a
moans of protecting the valuable prop
erty from further damage by'the'ele
ments. -;..t!
The concrete walks and grass plots
that have been constructed in front of
tho court house and hall of ■•records,
under the directions of our sheriff, are
both a benefit and ornament to 'the
buildings, secured at a very small cost.
In conclusion, we give our most sin
cero thanks to the different county of
ficers for their kindness in giving us
cheerfully, all the information wo ueod
ed in the transaction of our business.

The U. S. civil service commission
will hold examinations at several places
in each state, during March and April,
to secure young men and women for
the government service. 9,889 persons
secured positions last year through
these examinations. Probably 10,000
appointments will be made this year.
All appointments are for life, and for
most positions only a common school
education is required. Salaries at ap
pointment vary from $660 to $1200 a
year, with liberal promotions after

affords a good opportunity for people
between 16 and 45 years of age. Those

A report has been circulated that the
Native Sons have definitely concluded
to build a hall over their property on
Court street. The matter has been
hanging fire since the property was
purchased, there being a decided dif
ference of opinion among the members
as to the suitability of the site for that
purpose. Upon inquiry we find that
no- decision has been yet reached on
the subject. A committee has been
appointed to look into it and report.
A plan of a building has been prepared
by A. H. Knhlman, the architect, but
this was done entirely of his own mo
tion, and not at tho request of the
order. The construction would not
for obvious reasons be entered upon in
the winter season, and there is np
reason for a decision at this time.

Goldsworthy— Pense Wedding.
Last evening, at 8 o'clock, Richard
A. Goldsworthy and Miss Emma Maj
Pense were united in marriage. The
ceremony was performed at the resi
donce of the bride's parents, Mr. and
Mrs. F. M Penso, on Broadway, Jack
son, in the presence of a large number
of the relatives and intimate friends of
the contracting parties. • Rev. G. H.
Van Vliet of the M. E. church, per
formed the ceremony. The bride —
generously endowed by nature with
personal charms and grace of manner —
was elegantly and becomingly attired
in white silk, with a bridal veil of white
tulle. Miss Alma Mounter attended as
bridesmaid, and Eugene Devan as best
man. The parlor was tastefully deco
rated for the occasion. After the cere
mony tho company partook of a
sumptuous supper. The happy pair
were showered with congratulations
and well wishes of those present, and
were the recipients of a number of cost
ly and useful presents. They have
taken up their residence in their own
homeo.T Broad wa3', opposite tho resi
dence of Dr. Herrick.
The bride is the eldost daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Pense, a native of Jack
son, and is conceded one of the fairest
and sweetest belles of Amador county.
The groom is a young man of excellent
character, and steady habits, employed
at the Zeila. The Ledger extends its
greeting to the happy couple, and
trusts that the union so auspiciously
begun, will continue to be one of
unalloyed happiness and prosperity.
Italian Immigrants.
Twenty-four Italians, direct from
Italy, arrived in Drytown last Satur
day night. They were domiciled at the
hotel that night, but next day found
quarters with an Italian family in the
town. Most of the new comers are
able bodied young men. There were
three or four women and a like number
of children. None of them was able to
speak a word of English. . They come
as bona fide settlers, intending to make
a new home for themselves. They are
laboring men, and a number of them
have already scattered to various parts
of the county seeking employment.
We understand that ten more of these
immigrants were expected to reach
Drytown on Monday night. Areport
is current that these arrivals constitute
the advance guard of a far more for
midable army to follow from Italy for
Amador county. One said there were
about a thousand destined for this sec
tion, but this was doubtless not intend
ed to be taken literally, but simply to
indicate an extensive movement of
Italian home-seekers toward Amador
county. .

The regular meeting of the Jackson
republican club was held in the Ledger
office on Monday evening. After the
transaction of routine business, a very
enjoyable time was passed in cracking
jokes and giving reminiscences of early
days. Judge Davis gave an entertain
ing talk. The veteran, Thos. Green

ally to the fun of the evening. As the
state campaign approaches these
monthly gatherings will grow in inter
est. The Jackson club is the only po
litical club in the county tnat has kept
up its organization by regular monthly
meetings. It has accomplished this in
the face of difficulties incident to the
lack of interest in political club moet
ings when no campaign is in progress.
The new roll of the club has - between
70 and 80 members, which number will
bexapidly increased from now on.
Charged with Insanity.
Constable Scoble of Plymouth,
brought over last Monday a man,
whose name is unknown, to be examin
ed for insanity. He was wandering
about the country north of Oleta, scar
ing the residents of that section by his
strange antics. He cannot talk," and
was only half clothed. He is confined
in one of the insane wards at the
hospital — the first patient to occupy
the new insane quarters. As the su
preme court has just knocked out the
lunacy law, there is some question as
to the proper course to pursue in such
cases. The doctors think that the
man's mental condition may be partly
due to exposure and lack of nutriment,
and will see what a few days' liberal
board may dp in his case. He is
not dangerous nor violent. All that
can be learned from him is that ho has
been in the county jail in Solano county.

THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSON, CAIiIFOKJtfiA, FRIDAT. DECEMBER 13, 1901.
A TYPICAL CASE.
How a Drunk and His Honey Farted Com
pany.—The Story as Developed in the Trial
of Eugene McPherson.
The case of the people agaiiisl Eugene
McPhorson was commenced in the su
perior court last Wedtiefilay morning.
Defondant was cbargud with stealing
and converting to bis own use two
checks, the property of oue Joseph
Hawkins. The scone of tho light-
Bn gored transaction is ItiM in the pic
turesque village of Pi no! Grove, and
the story shows that amid the music
of tho pines tho wolvji )f human shape
who toil not and still contrive to live
and dress well, are ever on the alert as
well as in tho crowded cit.k'>, to pounce
upon the unwary, and relieve him of
his wealth.
Hawkins, the victim of tho plot just
unraveled before a jury, knows no other
way of making a living than by the
sweat of his brow. His besetting weak
ness is a taste for strong waters, and
his taste in this direction lasts so long
as ho has the wherewithal to gratify it.
With money in his purse work is not
to be thought 'of. After working for
for so mo time at the Standard Electric
Company's camp at Bear river — in the
wilderness of pines and away from tho
enticements of civilization — he wan
dered forth in tho latter part of Octo
ber to mingle once more in the haunts
of business. On the 2sth of that month
he struck his old stamping ground of
Pine Grove, his pockets loaded with at
least two company's checks — one for
$50.85, the other for $43.75— and some
coin. He had scarcely resumed his
residence in the pretty hamlet bofore
he became loaded up with something
besides money, unloading his cash at
the same time. Ere long he had a
full-fledged jag on— in that line there
is no half-way measures with Hawkins;
it is either 'a dead calm or a cyclone
with him. And those who know him
say that when the spirits" are in full
force and effect, ho is= practically ob
livious of passing events. He took the
precaution to speak for a bed at the
hotel. Thereafter, the defendant in
vited him, in the spirit of a good
Samaritan of courso, to share bed and
board with him that night, in a cabin
near tho postoffice occupied by him
and one Butternut. After supper, so
one of the witnesses for the defense
related, Hawkins strolled into a saloon,
and there bought from a peddler who
was staying there overnight, $3 worth
offish. He had partaken of fish for
suppor ,and was so enthused over his free
bill of fare that ho proposed to barbe
cue the town. But this is a side-light
from the main issue. Hawkins finally
went to bed with Butternut as a bed
fellow; the defendant occupying the
other bed by himself. Ho had his two
checks in a cartridge box in his coat
pocket. About 12 o'clock he woke up
somewhat recovered from his booze,
and in his strange surroundings be
thought him of his money. He exarn
ed his coat; the box was there, but
the checks wore gone. He asked Mc-
Pherson if he had them, and be said,
No. Hawkins said he had not indorsed
the checks either with his name or a
cross. ■ V-*
McPherson got up at 4 o'clock next
morning, boarded the stage and came
on to Jackson. He presented one check
bearing Hawkins name on the back, at
Coset's saloon, and got it partly cashed.
Mr Coset subsequently got wind that
there was something wrong, and got
back his money and returned the papor.
McPherson took the other check to H.
Weil's, bought a bill of goods and re
ceived $19 in money. About this time
constable Kay took a hand in tho
game, . arrested McPherson, and took
both cheeks in tow as evidence; both
papers were now mutilated where the
indorsements had been made.
McPherson took the stand in his own
behalf, and in trying to patch up an
ugly case utterly ruined' his:' cause.
He said that Hawkins gave him the
checks, told him to indorse them for
him, and get them cashed in Jackson.
At first he denied that Hawkins woke
up in tho night and inquired for his
missing checks. Then he weakened,
saying ho was not sure on that point.
Finally he admitted, under cross-ex
amination, with the cold sweat stand
ing in beads upon his face, and which
he kept wiping away, at the same time
calling for water— that Hawkins did
ask him if he had his checks, and he
said, "Yes." It was the most dramatic
and abject breakdown of a defendant
upon the witness-stand seen for many
years. His attorney, C. H. Crocker,
was dumbfounded by this unexpected
turn. The following jury sat on the
case: S. Isamjnger, D. T. Kerr, R. M.
Ford, J. W. Kirk. W. A. Gregory, J.
W. Loomis, C. A. Cramer, I. N. Chit
wood, T. C. Stowers, M. Hammer, W.
H, Blakely, and Robert Brown sen.
They were not long in reaching a ver
dict of guilty. Sentence will be pro
nounced Dec. 19.
Suit Against A. 0. V. W. of lone.
Morris Jones, as guardian of Bernard
Isaacs, has brought suit against the
Grand Lodge of A. O. U. W. to recover
the sum of $2000, alleged to be duo on
certificate of insurance in the order is
sued to M. Murray. Matt Murray was
a former sheriff of Amador county. In
1889, he borrowed from Isaacs $1200,
giving his insurance in the order as se
curity, the payment of which was
transferred from Mrs. Murray •to
Isaacs. Both Murray and his wife are
dead, and Isaacs wandered off in an un
sound condition of mind, and Jones
was appointed guardian to look after
his estate. The heirs of M. Murray,
being unaware of the transfer of the
insurance, applied for the benefits.
The order refuses to pay until the
question is decided in the courts as to
who is rightfully entitled to the insur
ance. Hence the suit by Jones to de
termine the issue. A. Caminetti and
D. S. Hirshberg are attorneys for the
plaintiff. The case is not of record in
this county.
Accidents.
A few days ago Martin Frasor, while
working in the blacksmith shop at the
Oneida mine, had the 'index finger of
his left hand badly crushed between
two pieces of iron, necessitating a lay
off jor some days.
Last Monday Jos. Isola had a finger
amputated at the Oneida mine by get
ting it caught in some manner by the
skip while in motion. Dr. Gall is the
attending surgeon in both cases.-

Mining Rotes.
Upton & Wheeler.— The Upton
mine, situated about seven miles north
eiHt of Plymouth, just over the border
in El Dorado eouuty, lias bi-en pur
chased by eastern capitalists! princi
pally of Pennsylvania. Under tho
name of the Western Pennsylvania
Mining Company, the owners are push
ing work with a view to tho early re
sumption of active work upon the
property. S. C. Wheeler has taken a
contract, to remove, tho 10 stamp mill
from Quartz Mountain and erect the
same on tins Upton claim. Men are
now at work taking it down and re
building it on the new silo as Fast as
the material arrives. Some work was
done on the mine years a>fo. and from
tho prospects obtained it is expected
that tho rock- will go from $10 to $15
per ton. Some estimates place it con
siderably higher than this. Although
the property is in El Dorado county,
all its business is transacted through
this county, Plymouth being its center.
The same company has purchased
the Wheeler mine near Plymouth, but
are doing nothing in the way of active
mining, except cleaning up around the
works, -
PEERLESS. — Operations at this mine
were suspended temporarily on the Ist
instant. The engineers are at work
keeping the water out. At the direc
tors' meeting held in San Francisco re
cently, it was decided to discontinue
work for a time. Word was sent up to
discharge all the miners. Those inter
ested say that work will be resumed
soon. There is a difference of opinion
as to the best method of conducting
further prospecting operations. There
is no doubt, however, that the prop
erty will be further explored, when a
plan of operations is agreed upon. .
Del Monte. — The superintendent
reports that the vein encountered in
running the drift has widened out to
three feet, of fine looking rock. No
assay of the ore has been made, but its
appearance justifies the opinion that it
is of a good paying quality. Work is
progressing slowly. A machine drill is
expected to replace hand d rilling in the
near future, and with additional means
which the sale of largo blocks of the
stock in tho eastern states will put in
the hands of the management, the
work of pushing the long tunnel, and
placing the property on a solid work
ing basis will be greatly expedited.
Keystone.— The renovated hoisting
works were started up Monday morn
ing, and- works smoothly and satis
factorily. The entire mine is again in
full running order.
Plymouth Notes. -F. A. Orr
writes us that another rich strike has
been made north of Plymouth, this
time on the Wyona quartz mine, owned
by Dr. Boyson, and which adjoins the
Orr ranch on the north. Hearing of
the developments on the Orr property,
Dr. Boyson started prospecting on his
own claim, with the result that be has
uncovered the vein in two places, about
250 feet apart. The fissure is 20 inches
wide, with gouge and some quartz.
Some quartz mortared by John Gordon
of Plymouth, on Tuesday laat, ran as
high as $40 per ton.
The Bay State mine has been sold to
San Francisco parties.
Buena Vista Mine.— The Buena
Vista Copper Mining and Reduction
Company is making excellent progress
at its mine. Within the past month a
boarding house has been built and a
road graded to the mine. Other nec
essary improvements in the way of
sheds for 'machinery and hoist are
rapidly ncaring completion. We are
informed that the many tons of sur
face rock on the company's property
contains fair values in gold and silver.
Ore from the old dumps assay from $27
to $38 per ton.

A Thanksgiving Wedding.
[From Ventura Free Press, Nov. 29.]
The wedding of H. F. Sheldon and
Miss Inez Tarr was solemnized at Con
gregational church on Thursday' aftor
noon (Nov. 28) in the preseuce of a large
number of friends and relatives. The
little church bad been beautifully dec
orated by the young friends of the
bride for the occasion. Before the
altar an arch had been erected, twined
with smilax and decorated with pink
flowers and bows of white ribbon, while
from its center was suspended a white
dove. The other decorations wore in
keeping with the occasion.
To the strains of the wedding march
from Lohengrin the bride, accompanied
by her mother, came .up the aisle of
the church, proceeded by two little
ushers, Sheldon Geary and Phoebe
Sheldon, and the ring bearer, little
Mildred Reese. Under the floral arch,
before the altar, they were met by the
groom and Rev. Queen, and the brief
but impressive ceremony was perform
ed which made them man and wife.
The bride wore a gown of white
chiffon trimmed with Valenciennes lace,
and over it were the misty folds of a
tulle veil caught with orange blossoms.
She carried a beautiful bouquet of
white carnations.
" After the ceremony, bride and groom
repaired to tho alcove of tho church
where a reception was tendered them!
The little church was well filled with
friends of the happy couple, and all
hastened to extend congratulations and
best wishes.
Amongst the young people of Ven
tura none are more popular, nor more
deservedly so, than Mr. and Mrs.
Sheldon. Both have resided hero for
some years, and both have made
friends without number. Mr. Sheldon
taught in the Calonea and Montalro
schools, and later attended the State
University. Mrs. Sheldon has also en
gaged in educational work in the coun
ty, her career in the Ventura schools
being most successful.
Mr. and Mrs. Sheldon will reside in
Fresno, where Mr, Sheldon has charge
of the science department of the high
school. They departed on Thursday
evening's train for Los Angeles. A
large number of their friends were at
the depot to bid them God speed, and
a number accompanied them as far as
Montalro.
In Los Angeles last evening a recep
tion was tendered Mr. and Mrs. Shel
don by the teachers of Monrovia,
where she was exceedingly popular.
[Mrs. Sheldon is one of Amador's
prettiest and brightest native daugh
ters, and resided here until she began
teaching in the southern portion of tho
state. She has many warm friends
here who would join those of Ventura
in very best wishes for her continued
happiness. — Ed.]

The Gotow Case.
The trial of Wm. Gotow, accused of
grand larceny, committed on or about
the 26th day of July last in. stealing
from the Stono Company at one of
their camps at Tabeaud reservoir a lot
of harness, was commenced in the su
perior court on Monday morning.
Little difficulty was experienced in se
curing a jury from the regular venire.
The following jurors were sworn to try
the case:
O. E. Martin, Lee Martin, J. C.
Rador, Thomas Simmons, Walter Dent,
T. K. Norman, W. C. Littlefleld, H.
N. Dickerman, Andrew Winter, J. M.
Kirk, Jos. Noe, W. H. Blakely.
The case presented some peculiar
features. Six sacks of harness were
missed from the camp, and hid in the
brush near the road side. Gotow and
another employe named Fred Christen
son, were arrested on the 29th of July
and charged with the. crime. Some
time thereafter Christenson pleaded
guilty, under the impression conceived
by himself that it would be better for
him to do so. Gotow, however, denied
any criminal participation in the affair,
and resolutely determined to stand
trial. Ho- has been confined in the
county jail since the 29th of July, being
unable to furnish bonds. Twice the in
formation filed against him on this
charge has been quashed on demurrer,
on technical grounds. He was rear
rested immediately after each dismissal,
and the third information was held to
be valid, and upon that the trial was
had. Christenson was brought up
from San Quentin as a witness, at the
request of the prosecution, but instead
was used as a witness for the defense.
It was brought out that this convict
witness was not interviewed by the at
torney for .the defense, Neil Mac
quarrie, prior to his taking the stand;
and also that he was interviewed by
the district attorney on the evening
prior to his taking the stand, and told
what the defendant himself had testi
fied to on that day. f His testimony
given at his own preliminary examina
tion, was utterly inconsistent with that
given in the Gotow case. In tho former
he implicated Gotow as the prime
mover in the crime; in the latter he
seemed to exonerate him. The story
as told by the prosecution was that as
Mr. Palmer, the book-keeper, was re
turning to the camp late at night, he
overtook Christenson and Gotow on
the roadside. They were hauling some
sack.3. They told him they had quit
work. Tho next morning the harness
was missed, but both men were at work
with their teams as usual. Remember
ing the incident of the night before it
naturally suggested itself that the two
men and the sacks were connected with
the missing horse clothing. Investi
gations resulted in Christensoa admit
ting the theft, and he took the officers
to where the six sacks had been con
cealed on the south side of the road.
Reaching the spot, they found only
three sacks. Gotow revealed where
the other three sacks had been re
moved to the north side of the road.
He was the only one who knew the
whereabouts of these sacks. Gotow
had a couple of horses and a spring
wagon in the neighborhood of SJab
town. He told a somewhat plausible
story that he had boon roped into the
affair innocently. He had been asked
by Christenson to help him move some
sacks, and did so, not knowing what
they contained; but he did know that
his companion had been in state prison.
Christenson corroborated his story to
the extent that Gotow did not take the
harness from the barn, and did not
know what the sacks contained. The
theory of the prosecution was that the
two men conspired to steal the prop
erty and divide it between. That the
three sacks removed to the north side
of the road constituted Gotow's por
tion, and the three left where originally
concealed were his co-worker's share of
the plunder. The jury got the case
about five o'clock, and in about an hour
arrived at a verdict of guilty as charged.
He will bo sentenced tomorrow.
A Woman's Awful Peril.
"There is only one chance to save
your life and that is through an opera
tion," were the startling words heard
by Mrs. I. B. Hunt of Lime Ridge,
Wjs., from her doctor after he had
vainly tried to cure her of a frightful
case of stomach trouble and yellow
jaundice. Gall stones had formed and
she constantly grew worse. Then she
began to use Electric Bitters, which
wholly cured her. It's a wonderful

Learning the Game,
Vhen that great piulnsiuan J. B.
Hickok, better known as "Wild Bill,"
came east on what he called a "redhdt
trail to learn something,", he stopped
one Saturday uight at a hotel in Port
land, He.
When he went to his room to seek
rest, he found that the adjoining room
was occupied by a company of fashion
able and rich young sports of Portland
■who, it did not take him long to dis
cover, were playing an Interesting
game of poker for high stakes. In vain
did he try to sleep. He could not do
so, and after au hour . arose, dressed
himself and knocked on the door.
Instantly all was silent; but he in
quired politely that as they would not
let him sleep would they let him come
in and watch the game?
They did so and were impressed with
the appearance of the man and asked
if he would Join them* '' : .\-'-'Z
"I will if you will post me; but, you
know, ' I'm a tenderfoot east." he re
plied.
They were willing to "post" him,
and, playing awkwardly, making blun
ders and asking questions, but seem
ingly greatly interested, he continued
to play until daylight, when he put his
winnings, some $1,500', in his pocket.
"I thank you, gentlemen," he said,
"and I'm rather glad you would not let
me sleep. I'll be here until tomorrow,
so keep me awake some more."
But the players did not appear again.

Greek and Roman Stoves.
Warm as Greece and Rone and
Egypt are, stoves were made there In
the dim and misty vistas of the past
It was not Just the pattern used at
present, but was a ' metal basin in
which charcoal, was burned. It sat In
the middle of the room, and as the re
sulting smoke. was of the slightest no
opening in the roof or elsewhere was
necessary. The same Implement, still
called by its old Greek name of bra
zier, is now employed in many portions
of continental Europe, where it is util
ized for heating as well as cooking.
 But the progressive Romans Im
proved on that and made a hypocaust.
It was the germ of the present fur
nace. It was made under the house in
a. little cellar prepared for it, aud the
heat was conducted to the rooms and
baths through crevices left in the floor
and lower portions of the wall. Later
flues were provided, conducting heat
to any portion of the house. In some
of the old Roman villas in England the
remains of these old time furnaces aro
still found. .
The Primary Planets.
The primary planets are those which

called secondary planets, satellites or

Happy Thought of a Han In a Plx.
An operator for a western railroad
who had served his company long and
well was called Into the office one day
and asked if he thought he could hold
down the Job of night dispatcher. He
promptly replied that he could and was
told to report for duty that night, and
his chief instructed him In what ho
was to do. Just after the chief left the
office it began to blow and snow, and
tho trains commenced to run late. The
new night dispatcher soon had develop
ed a bad case of "rattles" and almost
cried. He did not want an accident,
and he could not handle the trains. . So
a happy thought struck him. , As fast
as a report came in he replied, directing
the conductor to take a siding and
wait for orders, and it was not a great
while until he had every train on the
division sidetracked. Then he took a
book, lighted his pipe and sat down to
wait for daylight. In the morning the
chief appeared w.ith anxiety written all
over- his face.
"Any accidents, Johnny?" asked the
chief.
"Not an accident. I've got 'em all
on the sidetrack, snowed In and wait
ing for orders, and you will have to
get 'em out. lam going to blow this
job." It took the chief and his force

False Tails For Horses.
False tails are extensively made for
horses, old favorites especially, whose
caudal appendages present a woruout
and moth eathen appearance, like Pe
truchio's "old mothy saddle," and his
prodigiously mothy get up ("Taming of
the Shrew," HI, 2). They are also worn
by funeral horses, and by other horses
of exquisite outline selected for a par
ticular kind of work, but which are
somewhat spoiled in appearance by
the posses. *J .. .' .i rat tall (bald, like a
rat's). These useful appliances, how
ever, are not constructed exclusively
for harness horses. I have seen rows
of bogus tails, artistically joined on to
the crupper, hanging up in a cavalry
barracks ready for instant service, be
ing slipped on just like a finger stall.
The "fine ends" or false tails used
by nobody but "horse copers" or low
swindlers are most ingeniously fastened
on the animal's bare back by invisible
means. A dealer in horses never looks
at a horse with a bad tall, and he al
ways goes to the best market only.—
Chambers' Journal.
Robins Play at Being Dead.
One morning a well known naturalist
was greatly surprised to see a robin
lying on his back evidently dead, being
rapidly pulled round and round by an
other bird of tbo same species.
The naturalist at once came to the
conclusion that he had come in time
to witness the end vof a deadly en
counter, and that the live robin was
indulging in the cruel triumph of drag
ging his victim's lifeless body over the
stones. >-l:;-
But he was mistaken, for suddenly
the live bird went down upon his back,
his wings and legs were stiffened, and
he gave every appearance of being
dead, while the other robin who had
been sliamming death hopped on his
legs and proceeded to serve his com
panion in the same way as he bad
done him. Finally the two birds flew
away together to a neighboring tree.
low the People of Sangtr Keep Time,
The people of Sangir, an island of the
Malay archipelago, keep time by the
aid of an hourglass formed by arrang
ing two bottles neck to neck. The sand
runs out in half an hour, when the bot
tles are reversed. Close by them a line
is stretched, on which bang twelve
sticks marked with notches from one
to twelve, with a hooked stick, which
is placed between the hour last struck
and the next one. One of these glasses
keeps the time for each village, for
which purpose the hours are sounded
on a gong by a keeper. \
Four Kinds of Pupils.
The Talmud says there are four kinds
of pupils— the sponge and the funnel,
the strainer and the sieve. The sponge
Is he who taketh up everything, and
the funnel is he who taketh in at this
ear aud lctteth out at that; the strainer
is he that letteth go the wine and re
talncth the dross, and the sieve is he
that letteth go the bran and retaineth
the fine flour. The student who be
gins at least to wish to belong to the
last named class will not have been
sent to college in vain.

"No; but an ugly looking tramp came

"Great Scot! It must have been the
same tramp I bought him of."

SPRINGS IN THE SEA
FRESH WATER STREAMS THAT BURST
FROM THE OCEAN'S BED.
The Origin of the Cnderarronnd lUv
ern T'.tat Hare an Outlet Under the
Persian Gulf Has Never Been Satis
factorily Explained.
Along the shallow bottom of the
ocean, not very far from the land, a
number of openings have been discov
ered In various parts cf the world
through which water as pure and fresh
as that of nny bubbling spring mingles
with the salt water of the sea. Anoth
er remarkable class of fresh water
springs Is those that sink out of sight
or perhaps never come to the surface,
but follow hidden channels under the
land and under the sea until they final
ly come to the open air on an Island.
Both of these types of . underground
rivers are perhaps most remarkably Il
lustrated near and on Bahrein Island,
In the Persian gulf, a place that is also
noted as one of the chief sources of
pearls.
Bahrein Island, the largest of the
group of Islands bearing that name. Is
about twenty miles off the coast •of
Arabia In the Persian gulf. As the Is
land has almost no rainfall It Is a
dead level of sandy desert relieved only
by palm groves and patches of vegeta
tion where water springs to the sur
face from the mysterious underground
channels. In many places the water
does not reach the surface, but 1b found
by sinking wells, the water being rais
ed to tho surface by donkeys and bul
locks and poured Into :the channels
from which the date palms and other
crops are Irrigated, j These springs can
not possibly, be derived from the island,
and It is no more likely that they come
from the sandy wastes of neighboring
Arabia. The Arabian shore as far as
can be seen is low and devoid of water
except at El-Katif where similar
springs are found.
Arabs say; that these streams come
straight from the Euphrates river
through an' underground channel by
which the great river. In part, flows be
neath the Persian gulf. Geologists,
however, have dismissed this theory.
Though the origin of the springs has
not yet been satisfactorily explained,
the most favored theory Is that they
come froni the well watered slopes of
the Persian mountains far to the north.
If this theory Is correct,' lt means that
the rainfall sinks into the earth's crust
until It ' reaches impermeable rock
strata along which It Is carried for a
great distance to the south out under
the sea until the rock, sloping upward,
again brings -the- water near the sur
face on Bahrein island. Some of the
weils that are thus supplied are enor
mous, and one of them, the Adarl,
serves for the irrigation of many miles
of date palms through a canal of an
cient'construction. The Adarl well is
one of the great sights of Bahrein, be
ing a deep basin of water , 22 by 40
yards in size. . The fact that It comes
from a far higher source Is shown by
the force with which It enters the welL
Divers, driven back by the strong cur
rent, are unable to reach the bottom.
There being no wells within miles of
some of the coast towns of Bahrein,
they obtain water from springs that
issue from the bottom of the gulf not
far from the shore. These springs of
course have the same origin as -the
wells. Divers, with goatskins under
their arms, dive through the salt water
and fill the skins with the cold, fresh
liquid at the bottom. The water ob
tained in this . way usually contains
a slight admixture of salt water, so
that the mixture is Just a little brack
ish. At some of these openings at the
sea bottom the head of water entering
the < sea is so strong that when hollow
bamboos are pushed down into it the
water rises through the tubes, deliver
ing the fresh water dlrectlj* into ves
sels that are held by men and women
who are sitting in the boats that
brought them from the land. The
force of some of the streams as they
come from the earth Is so considerable
that It pushes back the salt water, and
the spring Is not mixed with the sea
water for quite a space around the
place of entrance.
It has been practically determined
within the past few years that the wa
ters of a small river In West Africa
which . disappeared in a fresh water
swamp that has no visible outlet find
their way by an underground channel
Into the Atlantic and mingle with the
sea through an opening in the bottom
that has been discovered a few miles
from Cape. Verde. A channel has been
found on the sea floor which, appar
ently, was cut by some fresh water
stream. During some soundings that
were made In 1895 for the purpose of
finding and raising a broken cable the
vessel engaged in the work was sur
rounded by swamp vegetation that was
continually rising to the surface. It
was evidently brought through the un
derground channel from the swamp.
- The breaking of a cable off the mouth
of the Rovuma river Jn East Africa
has been attributed to the destructive
action of a strong current of sweet
water entering the sea level several
miles from the land. Another remark
able example of a submarine river Is
found to the north of the city of Arlca
on the Pacific coast of South America
A river from the Andes that is grad
ually swallowed up in the sand has
been found to make Its way invisibly
Into the sea, with which It unites some
miles from the land.— New York Sun.
Brain Weight.
|It is stated by an authority that the

tion of climate, not of Intellect. The
colder the climate, the greater the size
of the brain. The largest heads of all
are those of the Chugatshes, who live
very far north, and next come the
heads of the Lapps.

&trlkli}4 a Light With a Popgun.
The inhabitants of the countries bor
dering on India have their own meth
ods or making fire. A Burmese mes
senger recently brought a note to an
English official, and the latter observed
something resembling a boy's popgun
hanging by the messenger's side. Cu
riosity prompted him to ask the native
what it was, and he was surprised to
find that it was a machine for making
lire.
The native exhibited the. apparatus
and explained the working, concluding
with a practical demonstration. It
was a tube, closed at one end and fitted
with a piston. At the end of the piston
was a groove or cavity, smeared with,
wax, which was used for making
thread or Inflammable material adhere
to It The tinder, to keep the old name,
Is pressed on the wax when a light Is
required and is not kept therealways. ■
Placing the wisp of . cotton on the
wax, the native Inserted the tightly
fitting piston in the tube, then forced
It along the latter by giving It a sharp
blow. On withdrawing the piston the
cotton was found to be alight, having
been ignited by the concussion with the
compressed air.— Pearson's Weekly.
Guisot, Thiers and Bismarck.
One day I was invited to dinner with
the Count of Enzenberg at the resi
dence of Prince yon Bismarck in Ber
lin. . The count, a former charge d'af
faires in Paris, was a great collector
of autographs. After a repast the
count exhibited a sheet of paper on
which Guizot and Thiers had affixed
their signatures. "It Is very interest
ing," said Prince yon Bismarck. "Al
low me to show this to my wife." (She
was sick in bed at that time.) In a
few minutes the chancellor returned,
and, returning the sheet of paper to
the diplomat from Wurttemberg, he
added, "I hope that I did not spoil it
by writing something on It" (
Here follows what was written on
the paper:
My long life bu taught me that it is necessary
to forgive a good deal and forget nothing. .
% Goizot.

cerity of forgiveness. Thiehs.

Blnnt Judge Morris.
On one occasion, in trying an abduc
tion case, Lord Morris, once chief jus
tice of Ireland, addressed the jury as
follows: "I am compelled to direct you
to find a verdict of guilty in this case,
but you will easily- see that I think It
Is a trifling thing, wMch I regard as
quite unfit to occupy my time. It Is
more valuable than yours. At any rate,
it is much better paid for. Find, there
fore, the prisoner guilty of abduction,
which rests, mind ye, on four points—
the father was not averse, the mother
was not opposed, the girl was willing
and the boy was convaynlent"
The Jury found the prisoner guilty,
and the judge sentenced him to remain
in the dock till the rising of the court
Hardly had he delivered sentence than,
turning to the sheriff, Lord Morris
said: "Let us go," and, looking at the
prisoner, he called across the court,
"Marry the girl at once, and God blesa
you both."
Wow High Birds Fly.
.A Strassburg aeronaut says he has
seen an eagle at the height of 3,000
yards, and again a pair of storks and a
buzzard 900 yards above the sea level.
On March 10, 1890, some aeronauts
observed a lark flying at a height of
1,000 yards. On July 18, 1899, another
balloon met a couple of crows at an
altitude of 1,400 yards. These, how
ever, are exceptions. Birds are hardly
ever seen above a height of 1,000 yards;
even above 400 yards they are not fre
quent
A Relic of Peter the Great.
The cottage where Peter the Great
dwelt when he was learning the trade
of shipbuilding in Zaarndam, Holland,
still exists, though somewhat dilapidat
ed. It contains the rude furniture
which the great Peter used— a bed
stead, table and two chairs. It is In
cased in a building erected for the pur
pose, and over the mantel Is a tablet
erected by Alexander of Bussla in 1814.
Pacing a. Natural Gait.
The pacing habit Is common among
animals, says a writer In Scribner's
Magazine. .Many animals pace— cattle,
for Instance; and, among dogs, setters.
I believe pacing to be a' rather more
natural gait than trotting. Trotting,
as it exists In oar fast horses, is scarce
ly a natural gait, but Is rather the re
sult of breeding and education. :', :':
A Night Light.
. Some people make It a point never to
retire without a light burning in the
house. A bit of information worth
knowing Is that a small even light may
be obtained from a small piece of can
dle all night If fine powdered . salt is
piled around the candle until the black
part of tho,wick Is reached.
Work For It.
Nothing that is of real worth can be
achieved without courageous working.
Man owes his growth chiefly to that
active striving of the will, that en
counter with difficulty, which we call
effort; and it Is astonishing to find how
often results apparently impracticable
are thus made possible.
Clean as a Whistle.
The origin of the saying "as clean
as a whistle" Is ascribed to the "whis
tle tankard" of olden times, in which
the whistle came into play when the
tankard was emptied or "cleared out"
to announce to the waiter that more
liquor was required.
Under the mogul emperors extensive
systems of roads were constructed to
India connecting all leading points In
the peninsula.
