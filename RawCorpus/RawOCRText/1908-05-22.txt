Mary Mine, JJliiir, Nev.,
May 16, 1!H)8. •
Mdltor Lodßor:—
Dear Hir-Whllo nitxJitatlng of old
Amudnr county it occurred to mo to
writo v linn to your viduabln papor,
which 1 nm glad to say, wo have th'u
pleasure of reading regularly ovory
week. And it conies jih a hitter from
homo to niynrlf, an well m tho rest of
nil tho Amiulnr county buys which
are hero, aud ' thero are many of
them horo. At times it makes
ono think ho was oithor iv Jackson,
Butter, or tho great city of An.ndor,
mill a more jolly whole soul crowd of
niGii and yonngstors it would be
dillicult to find. And as for their
work you can't boat them. Andrew
Noce, whom most everyone in Anindor
county hs well as adjoining counties
knows ;ih n mining man of ability, has
'"ad chnrgo of this property for v year
»r more, has achieved somo of tho
most economical mining known in
South Western Nevada, and 1 venture
to nay in tho state. Aud lam proud
to be able to write since the cora
mouciug of this short opistlo of Nev
ada, Noce has been put in full chargo
of tho property as superintendent.
Tho I'ittsburg Silver Pouk Mining
Company is now one of tho best
equipped mining properties, iv the
state, aud perhaps one of tho greatest
minea on the coast. The Mary Mine,
with many nioro minea in conjunction,
is giiniily a mountain of ore. The
mill which is 8 Stunted at the town of
lilnir, a distance of two and ono-half
miles by tho way of tho cable tram
way, doing a 100 slump mill running
full capacity, und supposed to bo one
of tho best in the state. Tho oro is
transported from the mine to the
to tho Head Jlouso ut tho top of the
train a distuueo of a mile or mom by
an electric locomotive, carrying v
train of oight cars, aud ono-half tou
to tho car. Tho mine at this timo,
and 1 would say lor years to . uorno,
will bo a tunnel proposition, making
it a miiiit of good ventilation and de
sirable working. •■ 'Xliis -.company is
now installing a three hundred hon-o
powor compressor, tho latest of the
lugereoll type, supposed to bo the
host. CJeo. O. Uradley, a very able
uiiniii" man, is widoly known us
general mauager of this property.
AmouK tbo Amudor county boys 1
will mention a few which 1 think
most of you know: We find Long
Rail be Ford, Karl Liversiidge, John
Noce and liradshaw us shift bosses.
Wo take a look in at the blacksmith
shop door, und find tboro Major
Lathleuu, an old timo Sutterito of
Wildman-Mubouoy fame, handling
tho tongs as of old, also we sea the
smiling luce of Johnnie Kedpatb, one
of Sutler's merry good, boys iv full
charge of the Wood Drothers drill
sharpener. He turns out drills liko
hot cakes on a hot stove. Then we

A now tent has benii purchased for
tho forthcoming Italian picnic. The
tent has already beeu received ut tho

tho middle of uoxt week. Tho tent is
in tho form ot a parallelogram 75x05
feet, and made something after tho
fashion of v cirutis tent. It will bo
much more convenient und cosy thau
the old affair, arrangements are being
made for shutting out wind mid
storm it necessary. The old tent had
become useless to withstand the

MINING NOTES.
Mine is Bonded.
3!ho Dane and Mitchell quartz mine
und mill, which is located near Pine
(irovc, has been bonded by tbe ownor,
John F. Davis, to John J. Orunmer of
thut place. Cranmer is to tako pos
session on tho first of tho mouth, and
must start operation ut once. Ho
agrees to sink tho shaft 100 feet below
the present levol wituiu the- next
year,|aud ouo-tourth of the cloau-up
each month is to go to the present
owner to be applied upon the pur
chase price. 850UO must be paid by
this time next year, and an equal
amount the following year, when a
deed will be given for the property.
Tho ton stamps on *ho property are
to be tunning within tho next couple
of weeks. The ledge on this claim is
known to carry good values, ami with
tho proper management will probably
become v large producer.
Argouant— This (uunpiiuv has start
ed the sinking of a new prospect
shaft about two thousand feet south
of the old one. It is tho intention of
the management to prospect their
ground thoroughly. It they do not
strike tho ore body in one place they
will try another. At the .lUOO level
tho values show up very well, aud it
in hoped that thoy can strike tho
snme body fiom a new shaft, liesides
which, this would give them better
ventilation throughout the mine.
Whether tho shaft started within the
pust few days will be the permanent
uiio is not determined; this will de
puud upon circumstances. Sinking
nitrations are being pushed along as
rupidly us possible. The mill has
buuu kept going, but not to its full
oapaolty. It is exnoctod that milling
operations will bo curtailed during
tin) development operations now in
progress. Thorn is little doubt, how
over, that this mine will come out all
light. It is almost a certainty that
good valuos will be opened up below
the present workings. The trouble
hasi beeu that prospecting and de
velopment work wore allowed to lag
behind, until the ore bodies in the
opi-nod levels were almost exhausted.
This applies only to tho vicinity of
the shaft, where practically all tho
ruck that haa Huppliod tho mill has
oonie ftom. The central aud south
poitlou of the Argonaut ground, as
well as the 1 1 olf man field, which is
also the property of the Argonaut
company, is virgiu ground. And
there ia every reason to believe that
pay rock will be touud iv this laige
extent of uuoxpored territory. It is
to this end that the euifuee operations
have been started iv this field, uo as
to tocate a desiruble point to sink a
permaueut shaft. Another shaft will
greatly improve mutters from a
ventilation standpoint.
Fremont— The work of clearing the
shaft ot the debris ouueod by the tire
is almost completed. They have
reached boyoud the 1100 level. The
skip was found ut about 1150 feet. It
bad', become detached from the cable
either by the effort to raise it or tho
fire had burned tho rope, it had
fallen some SO feot from where it
got cuught. No human body or re
mains were found near tho skip,
which tends to dispose of the reports
concerning a man being caught under
tho skip. The work of clearing bos
progressed much more rapidly than
was anticipated, and tho expense,
although great, has not been any
thing like so heavy as it was feared it
might be. It is "hoped to have the
full number of stamps in operation
by tho first of July, and also ttiat tho
era of dividends will uguiu be in
augurated <□ a short time thereafter.
Defender. — F. li. Joyce was down
from this niiuo Wodnesday, bringing
the output of bullion for the past
mouth for shipment to tho mint.
The iniuo is looking well, und tbe
product continues to ho satisfactory.
We understand tbe yield last month
averaged over SG per ton in free gold.
The cost of mining aud milling is
about four doliais per ton, so that at
the present rate tbe stockholders
have fully one-third of the product,
excluding sulphurets, as net profits.
Shot a Bear From Train.
The Yoaemito tourists on ttio train
Sunday nigbt bad some excitement
which 801110 saiil gave them their
mouoy's worth without going on to
Yosomite. It was not a holdup,^but a
genuine beur hunt. The train Jwua
proceeding up the canyon when con
ductor Monet saw a large brown bear
in the lirat gulch above Sweetwater
meek on the opposite side of the
Merced river from the tarin si i 300
ynnls distant. He quickly signalled
the engineer to stop and renohed for
hia 25-36 high power Winchester. iJy
tiiia tiaie the tourists had their eyew
on the bear aud the conductor and
bis gun. With the ornck of the rifle
Mr Hear lunged his full length into

clump of bushes, the bullet having
Htini'k him in the back aud passed
through the body. Evidently he had
just come out of bis wiutor quarters,
fpr his hair was Jong aud bleached,
it is in this gulch that the travelers
ou thiArain have been treated to the
sight of a herd of deer every evou

iJe seemed to run things with a
higher hand than the erstwhile loader
ever darod to do. I'he point on
which it is said McNab was unhorsed
was the matter of ■ instructing the
delegates. I'he forces marshaled
under Hell were in lavor of instruc
tions for JJryan lor president, in
accordance with the wishes of the
man from Nebraska. MoNab, on the
other hand, favored an uuinstructed
delegation.

EVERYTHING POINTS TO TAFT.
All delegates to the republican national convention having
been elected, it begins to look that Taft is destined to receive
the nomination on the first ballot. A clear majority of the
delegates are under instructions to vote for the man from
Ohio, and that settles it, unless something extraordinary
happens to change the situation, which is too remote a con
tingency to be considered. It is hinted that La Follette of Wis
consin, who is himself among the list of dark-horse candi
dates, will try to stampede the convention by placing Roose
velt in nomination. The move is said to aim at booming
himself into line for the presidential nomination four years
hence. But perhaps the object is to stampede the pend ng
convention to himself, after the fashion of Bryan's cross of
gold speech in the democratic convention twelve years ago.
A studied plan of that character would have not the shadow
of a chance, no matter what eloquence was brought into play
in the effort to carry it into effect. It is not probable that all
opposition to Taft will melt away before the convention meets.
Whatever opposition there may be to Taft, it is based solely
on the ground that he is believed to be backed by the strength
of the administration. Nothing can be said against him per
sonally. That he is in every way qualified for the high po
sition is conceded by all. As a cabinet officer he has shown
statesmanship of the highest order. He has been the right
hand man of the Roosevelt administration. He is heartily
in sympathy with the reform policies inaugurated by Roose
velt, but not an extremest. Of course, he is committed to the
republican principle of protection, although in favor of tariff
revision where it can be applied without attacking the pro
tective principle or endangering the home industries. With
Taft and Bryan as candidates — and that is how events seem
to be shaping — the main issue would be protection versus
free trade, or a tariff for revenue only, as the democrats pre
fer to call it, which really means the same thing. In such a
campaign the outcome is not doubtful. With the long period
of prosperity as the result of republican ascendancy under
the flag of protection, which every section of the country has
enjoyed, Taft will be picked as an easy winner. The talk of
the disaffection of the labor unions toward Taft will cut little
figure. Even if there is any truth in such talk, which is
questionable, the laboring men are not going to embrace
the heresies of Bryan, which mean a lack of employment and
a sweeping cut in wages for them. Debs will probably head
the socialist ticket, and may attract some votes from the
ranks of labor. This will be likely to hurt Bryan more than
Taft. With Taft nominated, all dissension in republican
ranks will at once disappear, and he will be carried to victory
by an overwhelming vote.
AMADOR BANK STATEMENT.
The official statement of the condition of the Bank of Ama
dor county on the ist of this month, which we publish in
another column, is a very satisfactory showing, in view of the
prevailing financial depression. The amount due depositors
in round numbers is $487,000, with cash on hand $224,000.
The available cash in proportion to the deposits is in the
ratio of 45 cents on the dollar. This is an unusual per
centage of the assets to be represented in money. Few if any
banks in the state can make an equal showing. For months
banking institutions as a rule have been complaining of a
shrinkage of cash on hand. The local bank, on the other
hand, has its vaults overflowing with coin. This conservative
management at this time must have a tendency to increase
public confidence in the bank. Indeed, the financial state
ment in itself is conclusive proof of the implicit confidence
felt in the soundness of the Amador bank.
The California delegation will be solidly for Taft, the state
convention having passed, without opposition, a resolution
instructing the delegates to vote for him.- Lincoln-Roosevelt
leaguers and the regulars should bury all petty quarrels, and
work harmoniously for the success of the party in the com
ing campaigu. Of course they will do so. Iv a national
canvass no true republican would dream of doing otherwise.

Wasps readily succumb before the
increasing cold of autumn. The few
that escape the merciless scourge of
mortality are the queens of next sea
son. They pass the whiter in some
warm cranny, nnd when the fiprlng
arrives each comes forth from its hid
ing place and seeks a suitable place
for tho nest that 1h to be. This found,
the queen repairs to n fence or tree
trunk and with her jaw rasps off n
bundle of wood fiber which when
moistened with saliva nnd kneaded
forms the paperllke substance of which
the nest Is entirely constructed.
Just as bees have Invented a peculiar
nest building material in wax. so
wasps havo prepared a special durable
paper for the same purpose. The queen
mother lays tho foundations of the
city with her own jaws. Sho attaches
a sort of stalk of wood paper to a
chosen support This may be the
branch of a tree, a root In a cavity
below ground or n beam in n garden
shed. The stalk prepared, the queen
builds a few shallow cells, in each of
which she lays an egg. As these ma
ture, hatch and develop into worker
wasps the labor of the little colony is
turned over to them, nnd thus n vast
nest with thousands of cells is evolved.

Tho Wrong Noll.
Nell Is a girl who lives up on Capi
tol hill. On Mondays v woman comes
to Nell's house to wnsh clothes. The
woman's name Is Nell too. One Mon
day Nell, the girl, was In the sitting
room reading when the telephone rang.
Nell, the washerwoman, answered the
ring. Nell, the girl, then heard Nell,
the washerwoman, say:
"Yes, this is NelL"
Silence.
"How's that?"
Silence.
"What! Am I mad because you
kissed me last night? Look here, man,
you're too fresh. Who are you any
way? I never kissed" —
Just then the telephone receiver was
wildly snatched from her hand. Nell,
the girl, blushing furiously, had grab
bed it She hung It on the hook.
"He wanted me," she said. "lie al
ways tries to tease me that way.' I— l
never kissed him in my life."
As she disappeared up the stab's the

A Ghost Under the Sea.
The story Is told of a diver who saw
two ghosts "full fathom five" under
the surface. He had gone down to the
wreck of a large steamer and was
crossing the main saloon when two
gray shapes of enormous size came
shambling toward him. He did not
wait to make notes for the Psychical
society, but gave the danger signal and
was at once pulled up. Told In the
cheerful light of day, It seemed rather
a lame story, and another diver went
down to see what he could make of It.
Toward him also came tho shambling
gray shapes. lie stood Irresolute for a
moment and then, going boldly for
ward, struck his hatchet through— a
mirror! The ghosts were only a dim
reflection of his own legs, much en
larged, of course, as everything is that
a diver sees through the great frontal
eye of bis helmet.
Hooded Snskes.
The hoods of snakes were unques
tionably intended by nature to act as
weapons of intimidation, for when sud
denly opened, as they are during the
excitement of a contest, these give
their owners an apparent and formida
ble enlargement. Hut the hoods which
have been bo useful nt some period in
snake history have now become so en
larged as to tend toward the extinction
of their owners, just us the overde
velopment in the tusks of prehistoric
animals led straight to their destruc
tion. During a light the hooded snake
in the act of striking his foe suffers
from the outstretched and weighty
hood— he 'overbalances himself and top
pies forward. His assailant, the mon
goose and some birds specially, seizes
him when prostrate und, ripping up
the back of the neck, speedily dis-.
patches him.
Badly Joined.
Mr. Itusscll In his "Collections nnd
Recollections'.' tells this story of an In
appropriate quotation: The leading cit
izen of a seaside town erected some
Iron benches on the sen front and, with
a view to combine tho commemoration
of his own beneficence with the giving
n profitable turn to tho thoughts of the
public, inscribed on the backs, "These
seats were presented to the town of
Shlngleton by Joseph Bugglns, Esq..
J. P. for this borough— 'The sea Is his.
and he made it' "
Ths Secret of Content
If men today actually possessed the
acres on which they toll, they would
be in no hurry to leave them; they
would be effectively chained to the
soil by the sense of independence and
proprietorship, as is the case among
the rural population of France, who do
not rent but own the land.— W. J.

Jackson, Cal.Amador County
Descriptive Article
Am ad or county comprises nn area of
'548 squaro miles. It Hos on the wes
tern slopo of Sierra Nevada mountains,
•nnd embraces within Its territory nil
tbo diversity of vnlloy, foothill, and
'high mountainous lands.
Climate— Tho climate of the popu
lous portions of tho county is as ponlnl
and healthful tucan bo found anywhere
In California. As cllmato Is ono of tho
most valuablo assets of this favored
stato In attracting 1 population, Amador
•stands second to no county In this ro
gard. It should, and no doubt will In
■time, when Its climatic advantages are
morn thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, become a health resort not
only for thoso in loss favored states,
but for tho residents of other parts of
California. The temperature alone the
•central portion rarely falls below 30
•degrees abovo zero In winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees in the sum
mer. Snow soldom falls In the settled
districts, and never remains on tho
ground for more than a few hours. Of
•course, In the high mountain rofiions
of eastern Amador tho snowfall is very
heavy— which Is characteristic of tho
entire Sierra Novadu range. Tho sum
mor season is alway accompanied with
•cool nights; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs aro rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
Infrequent.
Gold Mining.— Tho county, although
rich in other sources of wealth, com
paratively untouched, is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. Tho
deepest gold mines in America tiro lo
cated here. The Konnedy mine Is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
2000 foet below the surface, with every
indication that tho pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold, the county has contrib
uted fully $100,000000 to the world's
supply of the precious metal. The
mines ure still yielding at the rate o(
about two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
eight or ten mines operating on what
is called tbe "mother lode," stretching
clear across the county in a north-east
erly direction a distanco of twenty
mileß. The mines aggregate between
400 and 500 stamps, and furnish em
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
Industry is still In its infancy. Tho
unexplored territory, evtsn along the
maiu cold belt, Is, far In excess of tho
ground that has sictually been worked
or prospected. The county offers to
day one of the most inviting fields to
bo found anywhere in tho world for the
investment of capital in the fascinating
business of gold mininrj, not alone along
the mother lode, but also in tho almost
untouched mineralized country ot the
east bolt, some ten or twelve miles from
tho main lode.
Besides gold, we havo copper, do
posits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
limostone, granite, and soap3tono or
tale— all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities. — Tho agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. Tho valley lands
will produce anything that can bo
grown in the most favored suctions.
In tho foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetablo are raised whore irrigation
is practicable along tho numerous water
courses. Further up iv tho mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2.j00 foet, tho
M>il is admirably adapted for npples
und potatoes. A roady market for
many times tho quantity now raised of
these commodities can bo found lin the
various mining towns.
Grape culture and wlnemaklng aro
becoming Important industries, both
tho grapes and wine commanding a
bettor price than" itho product of tho
lowland.
Land is cheap compared with othor
•California lands. Improved farms may
be secured for one-fourth the price
•current in some places. Unimproved
lands can bo had from $o to $10 pur
acre. It does not require a fortune to
buy a small ranch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agrlculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts now devoted to
cattle ranges might bo made the homes
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amador has a population of less than
12000. Three fourths of this is concen
trated la a strip of three miles above
and below the mineral bolt.
Jackson, the county seat, has about
2500 Inhabitants, and Isun Incorporated
city ot the sixth class. Other towns
are Sutter Creek, Aimidor City, Dry
town, Plymouth, Volcano, Pine Grove
and Oleta. lone City is the metropolis
of the valley section, a thriving 1 town
of 1000 inhabitants.
The community Is law-abiding. Edu
cational facilities are excellent. A
school house is within easy reach of
nearly every family. There is one high
school, located at lono.
The assessment roll for 1007 is $•",.
£00,703, and the tux rate for both stato
and county purposes $2 on tho $100.
The Southern Pacific has a branch
railroad running to lone. From this

The Heart After Death.
Jiygienischo Zoitselnift bas an in
teresting art.iclo on tlm luecbainsm of
tbe action of tbe beart by Prof. Jlor
ing. He cays tbat doatb is never
iustantaneouH, (or many ot tbo differ
out tissues of an aniinnl oontiuue
tbeir activities long atter tbe organ
lain as a whole may be eaid to be
dead. Thin is specially noticeable in
some of tbe lower auimals. And tbe
heart of many animals will cuntiuuo
to beat long after its removal from
tbe body. Tbe heart ot the frog will
beat for hours, and tbat of tbo turtle
or Bnake for several days, or perhaps
a week, after tbe animal is killed.
From previous experiments made
on the rabbit, oat, dog and monkey,
Piof. lleriug found tbat tbe mam
malian heart can be uuoovored and
its workiugs observed, as well as tbe
effects of tbe stimulation of its
nerves, if it is kept supplied with
physiological salt solution. In these
investigations the heart was not cut
out after killing tbe animal, but iu
stead all superfluous fluid was remov
ed, and the heart, without tbe lungs,
was left in communication with the
rest of the body by means of tbe great
blood vessels and the nerves.
When the auriole of the beart has
been out away as fat as the wall
separating it from tbe ventricle, the
ventriole will respoud, powerfully to
the action of stimuli. If tbe auriole
is out away from a beating heart, tbe
ventricle is still for a time, and
after this pause begins to beat again.
If a solution of potassium chloride
is injected into tbe blood vessels,
tbe heart parts begin to beat rythini
oaliy together again. Potassium in
jected in this way, acts directly upon
tbe heart muscles.

If tho kidneys are well and strong,

Dorm's Kidney Fills make strong,

was in n miserable condition when
Drum's Kidney Pills were brought to

Added to those uiliictious was a too
frequent action of tlie kidney secre

EVERYBODY SWEARS.
Swearing is another name for Im
precation, aud imprecation is of two
kinds— profane and improtane. Never
heard of improtane swearing? Why,
it is with us every minute of the day,
and its vocabulary has no limits. Its
range is as wide aa that of expression,
nnd it is coextensive with every form
of life. It is common to animals and
to human beings, to both Boxes, and
to all peoples of every clime and
time. It is as natural as bad temper,
ancient as anger, and as universal as
lite itself.
■A dog swears when yon try to steal
its boue, a monkey when it is pinched
by a mifichievious comrade, and a hen
when you disturb its ohiokons. Cats
are territlo swearers. A cut will emit
a string of oaths as long as Uraadway.
Its range of expressiou is very limit
ed, but the cat gets out of it all thnt
is felinely possible. The parrot is a
rara avis among birds for vehemence
of speech, but, alnsl for fluent and
Jurid profanity it would be difficult
to find its equal. A parrot, has been
known tn swear even in tho presence
of a clergyman.
F.ven fishes swear. The evidence is
not sufficient to bring before a jury,
because fishes are very reserved; but
there is not tbe slightest doubt of the
fact itself. Imagine the feelings of a
shark just balked of its prey, or of a
trout tbat has swallowed the hook
under the impression that tho book
was a fly, and then ask yourself what
you would do in like huso. Aud as we
ascend the scale of fife we still find
tbe same habit surviving. Children
swear hy smashing their toys when
they can't have all their own j^way,
and by yelling aud lnokiug tbe door
when they have beeu put outside for
being naughty.
Women swear with a look when you
tread on tho'ir new dress and tear it;
they swear by knocking the cat over
when it has stolen a fish; they sweur
by slamming tbo door because some
thing has gone wrong.
Men swear by banging tbeir fist on
tbe table or stamping tbeir foot on
tbo floor, or kicking tbe unoffending
dog out of the way. And— tell it not
in ' : iilh— olorgymuu swear decorously
aud on special occasions. They
swear when, finding, say, a brass
button in the offertory, they pitch
tbe eleemosynary fraud out of the
window. And yet again on arriving
at the vestry aud finding they have
brought the wrong sermon they swear
by slamming It down on tbe vestry
table. All these varieties of objur
gation, (the parrot's exoepted) con
stitute a mode of swearing which is
inarticulate, but offensive. In con
trast with this Is the opposite method
—the method which la articulate, but
inoffensive.
"liothor HI" says a woman when
her sewing thread breaks, or "con
touud it!" when tbe baby spills a
cup of coffee over the tablecloth.
"What the dickens" eaya a man, or
"Well, I'll be banged 1" or if he be a
rufluod up-stater, he adds to the
gayety of bis cousins of tbe city by
such a phrase as "Uol duru it!"
ihis kind of objurgation bears the
game relation to swearing proper as
temperance beverages bear to malt
liquors.
For improfane swearing in its most
killing form one cau be commended
to tho prophets anoieut aud modem.
All other modes ot malediction are
ns wator and wine compared with
their volcanic outbursts of white-hot
Java, their scorching blasts of impre
cation that would shrivel up an ice
berg. Hot as tbe llarmattau, san
guine as the simoon, terrible as an
army with banners, is the prophet
when he gets ptopeily wound up.
"Woe unto the wicked, it shall be
ill with him; for the reward of his
hand shall be given him."
"Woe unto them tbat draw iniquity
with cords of vanity and sin as it
wore with a rope."
"Woe unto them that call evil good
and good evil; that put darkness for
light, and light for darkness; tbat put
bittor for sweet and sweet for bitter."
And bo is quite rignt.

With every year tbe unemotional
logic of statistical figures seoms to
show thnt the French rnce is really '
passiDg— slowly, to bo sure, but none
the Jess nctually. The population of
Franoe, whoso thirty millions formed
the most numerous national mono
lingual group in Kurnpo at the open
ing ot the last century, has increased
only i!G per cent during tho past one
hundred years, as agaiust Kngland'a
IJSO per cent, and America's l,(iO0 per
cent. The total population ot France
is now 38,300,7:18. The female sex ex
ceeds the male in number, the figures
being, respectively, 19,533,809 and
18,818,889. On the other hand, an
excess in the number of the uumarried
is shown on tho masculine widow*
and divorced women, as against 1,005,
884 widowers aud divorced men. The
number of French families according
to Harper's Weekly, is 9,781,117, of
which 1,314,733 aie without ohildren;
2,219.33J have but one child; ii,OIB,GUS
bavo two; 1,240,204 have three; 748,841
have four; 429,790 have five; 218,159
have six; i:JS,7!)() have seven; 71,811
have eight; and 33,917 have nine
children. These figures continue to
represent, iv a rapidly decreasing
proportion, the number of families
having a larger number of ohildren.

FROM OUR
CORRESPONDENTS
AUKUM.
Mny IH— Quite n good deal nf rnin
has f n lion in l.hnao partn since 1
wrote you lust. On Suiidny iil«ht
last the rnln fell- constantly and
henry nil night long. Where once
wiia unoaaitießa on the putt of evory
oue us to tho failurn of crops, 11, .haw
now been dispelled. On Alondny
bight about '2 o'clock we were trontod
to n thundorstorm. Tho rain fell for
about ati hour In pel feet torrents.
About two nud one-half miles from
Aukum on Hobett Jamcrann'a place
the lightning struck n cedar,' ttee
shivering it to atoms. The thuudor
burst with torrillo force and eepinod
to be tenrlug through the flrmnmont
as if desirous of ripping the ethereal
forces asunder. Many a little one
hovored closely, to It's mother
brmist, as tho great lumbar wngon
wont thundering on its way. Many a
mother, too, shivotod with iuvohiu
tary toar as the Rront roaring clnpa of
tbundor burst ovor their heads. Ono
man enid to me, "It Boomed my
house had tlirned'iuto bursting wholla,
and I conldn't help from jumping
when tho terrific chips of thunder
burst around mo. "
The cry of hnrd times abend is be
ing prophesied by n good many. The
money crush that always procedes a
presidential election is responsible
for the greater part of tho hard times.
Political economists will toll you in
glaring ilgurcs that it is an overplus
.of cxertioiiH or tbo adaptation of
capital in various branches of specula
tive industry. Hut the Tact is, thero
Is a liii; scheme in the background,
with tho manipulator at the wheel.
The political forces poiut to Tnft ou
the republican si Jo. Bryan is named
as the coming mau on the democratic
side. Hul, there is a serious doubt in
my mind whether some dark horse is
nut ridden into tho ling on both
sides. As tho late (J. i\ lluntington
said in an investigation before aou
gress onoe, "I have always regarded
everything uncertain till I know it to
be a certainty." Xaft is popular nud
unpopular. His popularity is not for
any thing great bo baa done himself,
but ho is simply tho protege of the
president. As to Uryau he has run
too often to be n real successful
candidate in tho race. Tho principles
ho has enunciated upon the stump are
too well known to bo commented up
on. The great mass of" wealth is
opposed to either Taft or BryaD. No
matter whether ono likes or dislikoa
their altitudo tliey will remain tho
factor of all factors. JSrains can't
copb against money or capital and
starve. Money c:iu Jio idlo nnd
laugh. The tie up of money is the
knots they have mado and will con
tinue to make. When tho timo coiuoa
they will indorse tlio man that will
indorse thoni. As to patriotism it is
simply fud^e. Jt is a matter of
practical business with them, first
last and all tho time. Wo need not
look for thing to brighten before tho
close of tho presidential election
next fall nnd even not then it com
bined capital does not indorse the
successful candidate. Theso are the
stern facts in tlio matter in a nut
shell. In my opinion tho republioau
convention will try to runominnte
Koof-evclt at tho start. As to the
democratic outlook it appears JJryan
again, if so, ho will in my opiniou !je
solidly defeated. lie cut his throat
as lloury Clay did to become presi
dent by writing aud saying too much.
Thero was a picnic at Wrigglea

Importance of Sanitation.
" rim splendid achievements of
polcntiflo medioine in civil life in the
prevention of disease, should be even
•nore effectually obtained In nn army,
where only healthy men are accepted,
and vigorous outdoor namp life
should keep its units, who are subject
to strict military discipline, in per
feot physical conditiou. Health
alone, however, is no guarantee
against tho iußidlous attack of the
silent foe that lingers in every camp
and blvouao," says a surgeon in the
April Appleton's "It is this foo, as
the records of war for the past 200
yoars have provod, that is responsible
tor tour times as many deaths as the
guns of the enoaiy, to say nothing of
tho vast number temporarily Invalid
ed or discharged as unfit for duty. It
is this dreadful unnecessary sacrifice
of life from preventable dineaso that
constitutes the hell of war today. In
tho Husso-Turklsh war the deaths
from battle casualties were 20,000
while those from disease were 80,000;
in our great civil conflict of the
nearly IXIO,OOO men who perishod on
both sides, about 400,000 were sacrific
ed to disease to 100,000 from battlo
casualties. In a recent campaigu of
tbo French in Madagascar 14,000 men
were sent to the front, of whom 29 were
killed in action and over 7,000 perish
ed from preventable diseases. In the
Hour war in South Africa the J^ugltsh
losses wore tea times greater from
disease than from the bullets of the
ouemy. In our recent war with
Spain 11 Jives were needlessly sacri
ficed to ignorance and inoompetency
for every man who died on the firing
line or from tbo result of wounds.
The difference between the martyr
and the victim, between the soldier
who falls on the field ot honor, and
the man who meets a miserable death
from preventable disease, for which
his government is criminally respon
sible, is as wide as the celestial diam
eters. The one meets death compen
sated in the thought that bis life is
given iv the protection of his
country's flag and honor, the other is
ignominiously forced to his grave
through the neglect of the government
that shamefully failed to protect the
life bo offored in its defense. .This
man represents the victim of the hell
of war. That the monstrous, sacrillno
of 80 per cent is almost totally uu
nocossary, was'ubuudiiuMy proved in
the records of tho Japanese war,
whore 1,200,000 men were sent to the
front, in a country notoriously un
sanitary, and ouly 27.000 men died
from disease to D'J.OOU who fell in the
legitimate Hue of duty on the Held of
honor. This because the Japanese
had a properly equipped medicul and
sanitary deportment, whose ■ottJoers
were empowered to enforce proper
sanitation and hygiene. In tho army
of the United States in 'IHOB, 1,2,649
picked soldiers died in three months
in the pest camps of their nativo land,
without leaviug the country, or evei
havingTbeard tho hum of a bostilo
bullet. These men ropreseut tho hell
of war as it would exist again in our
army it we wore suddenly called upon
o face au mutiny who is prepared to
meet us."

AMADOU LEDCfETJ: JACKSON, CAL
The Ghost Spy.
[Original.]
"General, we bring you a spy. While
at work on the breach the enemy mnde
yesterday we discovered this man or
boy. whichever lie may lie, at times
working with us, at times looking
about him nt the appronches, th«
mote, the walls, as If searching for a
weak point. He did not 'remove his
armor, as we did, for freedom to work
and kept Ills visor closed. Suspecting
him, we seized him."
"Ah, ha!" exclaimed the general.
"Take him to the parapet and hang him
in view of the* prince who Bent him."
A gibbet wns erected, a ladder placed
In position and the prisoner taken onto
the parapet for hanging. He begged
that he might offer his last adoration
to his God In his own way, and when
permission wns given him, facing to
the west, where the sun was sinking,
he bowed low threa times.
"He's worse than a heathen," cried
the captain of tho execution party.
"He worship* fire. Send him to hell,
where he belongs."
The youth wns forced to climb the
ladder, the noose was put about his
neck, and tho ladder was kicked away.
There were n few Jerks and all was
quiet.
The night wns dark. The sentry who
guarded that pnrt of the parapet where
the spy hui'.;: was obliged to pass and
repass the grewsome object on his beat.
At flr3t he would not look nt It. Then
In passing lit* turned his eyes toward
it, as though compelled by a dread fas
cination. There was nothing of the
body to be seen within the armor ex
cept a lock of hair that hung below tbo
helmet
"It doth amaze me," muttered tho
sentry, "bow long these cavaliers wear
their locks. Mayhap It serves for a
rope whereby Satan lowers them into
the burning lake."
Encouraged by the thought, he gave
the corpse a poke with his pike. As !t
swung back toward him ho thought
he hoard a low moan. Darting to the
end of his beat, he hid behind a stone
projection and could not Induce him
self to again walk past the body.
While he stood shivering in his corner
a wind sprang up, swaying the dread
ed object and occasionally knocking
tho steel armor against tho gibbet. To
shut out the sound he put his fingers
In his cars.
When he heard the relief coming he
took up his pike and resumed his beat.
There was the ghostly thing still sway
ing in the wind. The sentry was re-:
licved, and his successor, a braver
man, marched to and fro on his beat
without fear. Once when passing It
occurred to him to strike It with his
pike. What was his surprise to bea.r
it emit a hollow sound. Ho struck it
again, with tho same result. Then he
put a hand under one foot and lifter!
it without any more exertion than
would be required to lift 'an empty
suit of armor.
"Captnlu of the guard," he cried,
"the devil has flown away with tlis
spy's body!"
The captain came, examined tin.
armor and stood aghast. Then hs re
ported the fact to the general. Tlio
general came, saw and was conquered.
They were, superstitious in those days,
and he believed that the spy was n
supernatural being who had come to
find out how best the stronghold could
be taken. The ghost had seen that
but a handful of men defended It. Be
sides, It had seen a circuitous path
that led to the roar, over which a force
might come and lire into the works
from a greater height. The general
went trembling back to his quarters.
The next morning he saw the forces
of the enemy drawn up prepared to
climb the heights and a detachment
moving toward tho path leading to his
rear. lie ordered a white flag display
ed on tho battlements.
Later a party carrying a litter came
up the declivity. In the litter wan a
girl, pale nnd languid. A yotrag knight
who accompanied her stated that sbe
had been sent to receive the surren
der. The general gave It, saying:
"I can fight men, but not spirits.
Yesterday a mysterious stranger wan
observed npying on our works. He had
neither the fnce of man nor womr.n,
but a creature* betwixt the two. We
hanged him on the parapet that five
prince might be deterred from sending
others. In the night that which seem
ed to be a body vanished.
A smile came upon the girl's wan
face. "General," she said, "I was this
supernatural creature. I volunteered
to come and get tho Information re
quired for your defeat. Before the ex
ecution I bowed thrice to the west,
which, by a code agreed upon, told the
prince your weakness and the best
route of procedure. When I was hang
ed my hair was loose under my hel
met nnd protected ray throat from the
noose, which, too, caught In a projec
tion of my armor, I remained uncon
scious till"— Sho looked at her com*
panlon: He said:
"Seeing the body of my affianced
bride hanging on tho parapet, I resolv
ed to secure It or die. A party brought
ladders, by which I crossed the moat
and by another climbed the battle
ment. As I was about to cut tho body
down I heard a moan. I loosened the
noose, took the burden to the other
side of tho moat and sent a man back
with the armor to hang it up, thinking
to conceal the theft till we could take
counsel. Our bravo girl was brought
back to consciousness, and the prince
gavo her the right to receive your sur
render."
The girl who had achieved this great
work and nerved herself to complete
It as soon as the story was told faint
ed. It la one thing to do the work ot
a its, another to be hanged.

When a mother wnlrus percelvea a
sea wolf, she endeavors to throw her
cub on to au Iceberg If one Is near.
Fnlllng this, sho gets It on top of her
head and swlras with It above water.
But this Is vain. Diving far below, the
fish of prey comes up with tremendous
force, striking the frantic mother a
terrlflc blow and jolting the cub off
her head Into the water. Here It falls
an easy victim to the assailant and Is
soon devoured.
In Its work of destruction the sea
wolf Is frequently aided by the thrash

blow with Its tall.
Got Something For Nothing.
Mark Twain told how he got some
thing for nothing one day In the early
sixties when he needed the money. He
walked Into a hotel and was petting a
strange dog. General Nelson A. Miles,
who chanced to be present, offered him
$10 for the canine.
"To be frank," said the- humorist to
General Miles, "I haven't really got
,any right to sell you this animal, but if
you'll give me $3 you may take the pup
away when I'm not looking, and I'll
not tell who took it."
The bargain was closed, and General
Miles took the dog to his room. A mo
ment later the dog's owner Inquired
for his pet, and Mark Twain offered to
find the animal for $3. The humorist
then went to General Miles' room and
explained all. had the dog returned to
him. gave the army officer back his
money and returned the canine to its
original owner, thereby making $3.
How to Gat Poor Quick.
Do not try to save your loose' change.
It Is too small an amount to putln the
savings bank. It would not amount to
much anyway, and there is great com
fort In spending it. .lust wait until you
get sufficient worth while before you
deposit It.
Do not try to economize. It is an in
fernal nuisance to always try to save
a few cents here and there. Besides,
you will get the reputation of being
meun und stingy. You want everybody
to think yon are generous.
Just look out for today. Have a good
time us you go along. Just use your
money yourself. Don't deprive your
self for the sake of laying up some
thing for other people to fight over.
Besides, you are sure of today. You
might not be alive tomorrow.— Success
Magazine.
Helping the Pootoffice.
In a history of the great advance in
postal methods accomplished by Sir
Uowland Hill is given this anecdote:
To the postotneo of at that time tiny
Ambleslde came one day a well to do
man to buy a stamp to put on the let
ter he was about to post "Is this new
reform going to last?" ho asked the
postmaster. "Certainly," was the re
ply. "It is quite established." "Oh,
well, then," said the man, resolved to
give the thing generous support, "give
me thre« stamps!"
His Bachelor's Degree.
"I'm so huppy," said Mrs. OldcasMe.
"My son is to get his bachelor's degree
this year."
"Is he?" replied her hostess. "Well,
I can't blame you for feelln* as you do
about it. I never thought much of that
snippy Wilson girl he's been goln'
with. How did you get the match
broke off?"— Chicago Record-Herald.
Smoothing the Way.
"My lawyer told me he thought I
would have a bard time establishing
my claims under the will."
"What did you say?"
"I asked him how much more money
be wanted."
When They Art Quiet.
"I like to go to church."
"Why?"
"Well, it's comforting to see a man
keep a hundred women or so quiet for
an hour."— Bohemian.

Collections of these plants now beiug
made in London und New York are to
begin v system of weather obsor
vatones. The Bystem is to be soon
extended to Kuu KrnnolKCO, JSomluiy
and Tnkio, aud from tbe ll vn stations
it is expected that tbe northern
homispbere will be' efficiently served
with the following weather plant fore
casts: i. Special charts, i!i to 29 dnys
in advance, showing tbe "critical
barometric ceuters, with atmospheric
aud eutthquake disturbances and i isles
of firedamp explosion. '2. A daily
general chart showing the movements
of tbe ctitical barometric centers for
28 days ahead. 3. A • daily chart
showing lines of equal barometric

A daily chart showing areas of rainy,
fine and foggy weather 2 to 7 days in
advance. 5. Daily local details of
weather within 60 milea 48 to 72 hours
in advance.
The greatest known daily range of
temperature is found in Arizona,
where a change of 80 degrees in 12
hours frequently occurs, and wheie
Ihe mean annual temperature is 45
degrees in the notth and 69 degrees in
the south with 120 degrees as a fre
quent summer maximum. The most
equable olimate, on tbe other hand,
ii claimed by Honolulu. Tbe maxi
mum tempAruturo in 1907 was 80 de
grees on September 3, the minimum
was 58 degrees on March 13, and the
yearly average was 73.82 degrees. The
yearly rainfall, 2.81 inches at Yucua
and '24.65 inohes at Flagstaff in Ari
zona, has averaged 30.25 inches for 10
years in Honolulu, with a minimum
of 10.04 and a maximum of 50.30

Psychotherapy, or mental healing,
is not now. lint mind treatment may
be of scientific aud well-ordered kind,
applied with some understanding of
I:a physiological effects and limifa
tions, or it may be the mystic
medicine of the savuges, the oracles
aud the religious zealots. In a receut
discussion among Pennsylvania medi
cal iuhu. Dr. Chas. K. Milla, pointing
nut that faith is often essential iv
medicine as iv religion, gave these as
tbo psychotherapeutio methods accept
ed by the scientific physician: (1)
Tbe use of hypnotic procedures; (2)
suggestion in the wakiug state; mil
(3) education or appeal to reason.
Miuil stimulutiou, oven in blind aud
hupbazurd way, may do much to cure
disordered nerves. -Mind treatmeut
by clergymen and other noiiinodioiil
peruous is always to be condemned,
because indiscriminate reliance upou
this loads to fulse security, and brings
ucgloct wheu prompt phyßicul treat
ment by the trained physician is
uuoossHry to savo life. Dr. Chus. \V.
liarr finds that there is rapidly grow
ing up iv America an unaccountable
HupoVstition, comparable with witch
craft and other delusions of the past.
Holf-atyled haulers claim to ooutrol
some occult lorcu out&ido of them
bovloh, and frojit tbo physician's
limited power known as suggestion
they make an exaggerated aud cou
torted showing of mysterious results.
The chief evil, us iv a unintelligent
mind treatment, is that medical aid
will bo too loiik withheld in critical
stages of disouHC.
Khlmuh is it I'ik morn commou dis
ease than is generally admitted, so
that Dr. K. C. Hhroeder, of the
bureau of uuimal industry, uigita.con
stuut observation of dogs and thoir
muzzling in public pluces. Keoent
p: ogress lain greatly lessened its
effects, for, since Negri's dibooeery iv
1903 of tbe distinguishing micro

(Original.]
when the Spnnlsh-Amerlcan war
enmo on Milton Forester tvns n lien
tennnt In the national gtiiml. 110 re-
ceived n captnlncy In the volunteers
and marched nwny with his regiment
■Old the plaudits of tin throngs who
Unod the streets. There wns one face
nt nn Upper window which nbsori>ed
fill the young soldier's attention, the
fnco of hlf, flnncee. Mnry Mills. The
look of pride In him nnd love for him
that beamed In her ores might hnve
cxhllnrated another, but Forester was
n peculiarly sensitive man— a man to
dread a possible failure, lie knew
thoro were certain men whose coustl
t!onnl mnkeups unfitted them to be
soldiers, nnd no man can tell whether
ho Is one of these till he comes to face
Kliot nnd shell. lie dreaded lost ho
might prove unworthy. Should ho
falter under the terrible strain of but
tle ho would never see Mary again.
Forester thought too much of this.
It Is well for oiie to realize obligations
he has tnknn upon himself, but he
Should not permit himself to brood
over tho matter. Forester worried all
tho way to Florida, from Florida to
Culm and during the campaign until
tho final fighting, which was tho first
time he was under fire.
It -was during this contest about San
t!s?o that his regiment was ordered
forward In the face of a terrible fire.
One's llrst fight is the most trying of
nil. It Is then that tho soldier for the
first time hears the ugly stinging sound
of ballots, the rattlo of machine guns
and tho screech of shells, to till of
which thoro Is tbe background of In
cessant roar of cannon. Forester looked
n little pale, but pressed resolutely on.
All of a sudden he became conscious
of a dizzy, nauseating sensation, his
foot struck something— or he thought
it did— and he pitched forward. The
regiment pushed on. Another line of
battle came up and was pressing for
ward when Forester was awakened,
as It were, by the sound of a voice.
Nathan Burge, an old and tried friend,
had seen him, recognized him and
stopped to succor him.
"Nate," said Forester. "I've fallen
out of the ranks. I hadn't the physical
ability to go on. Write to Mary Mills
and toll her that I'll never see her
again. She has loved a coward!"
"111, you. there! Move on!" cried an
officer who was marching In rear to
drive on stragglers. Without a -word
Burge hurried forward, leaving his
friend to his own regrets.
When the fight was over Burge
sought Forester, but, not finding him,
supposed that he had hidden his
shame by desertion. He waited for a
time, thinking that the coward might
turn up, but he did not. Burge's regi
ment was ordered to the coast at the
close of the war and was one of the
first to embark for home. When he
reached Montauk Point the first per
son ho met was Mary Mills. She had
come as a nurse. She inquired eagerly
for her lover.
Burge provnrlcatcd. He could not
bear to deliver tbo message with which
he had been charged. But Mary, with
a woman's quick eye where love la
concerned, saw that he was concealing
something and assumed that her
fiance had been killed. Burge would
much rather have broken such news
to her than that ho had turned out a
coward. At last he told her the truth.
Mary Mills went homo bowed down
with grief.
The noxt morning she heard one of
her sisters reading from newspaper
dispatches from Santiago. She was
about to leave the room, dreading lest
Mho should hear that her lover had
been ordered before a court martial to
bo tried for cowardice, when his name
was mentioned, but in a different way
from what slio had expected:
Milton Forester, wounded In tho stom
ach. Operated upon nnd expected to re
cover. Promoted to bu captain, vice John
KelloEg, killed.
Forester after being left by Burgo
tried to rise. Ills object was to push
forward with a view to getting himself
killed. But he found himself too weak
to rlso. At that moment a surgeon
with an ambulance corps came hurry
ing on, making hasty examinations of
tho wounded lying on the Held. Com
ing to Forester, ho saw blood on his
clothing, tore open his coat and said:
"A bad wound."
"I? Wounded?"
"Yes; In the stomach."
"Thank God!"
The surgeon looked at him with a
puzzled expression, but there was no
time for words, and after ordering a
rescue party to take him to a hospital
pushed on.
When the boys of '01 were shot In
tho stomach there was nothing left for
them but to pass the dark portal. Not
so In the Cuban war. By that time
such progress had been mada in sur
gery that Forester's stomach was laid
Imre. tho wound Bowed up. the stom
ach put back in place, and in time tho
patient was ns well as ever. As soon
as It was safe be was put on a trans
port and sent north. When as a con
valescent he walked slowly down the
gangway to tho dock his friend Burgo
and his fiancee. Mary Mills, were there
to meet him.
"What did you mean," said the for
mer, "by putting up a Job ou me like
that?"
"Well, I'll toll you, Nate. I ouoe ask
ed my father, who commanded a bat
tery In the civil war, how he felt on
going Into a fight. He said It made
him sick at his stomach. I felt sick,
nud I dldu't know I'd been struck."
Mrs. Mary Mills Forester, vow a ma
tron of thirty-two, says she believes
tbero Is a good deal of humbug about
"the fearless heroes of war."

As a sample of democratic wisdom and statecraft, we pre-
sent the following chunk, taken from the platform adopted at
the state convention held this week at Fresno. Democrats
are in their glory when they are hammering the industries
of the country and shutting off the revenues of the govern*
incut by their free trade proclivities:
We favor an immediate revision of the tariff by
the reduction of the import duties. Articles enter
ing into competition with articles controlled by
trusts should be placed upon the free list. Material
reductions should be made in the tariff upon
the necessaries of life. We demand ■ the
immediate repeal of the tariff on lumber, wood aud
wood products, whicli tariff operates as a premium
upon the destruction of our forests aud the destruc
tion of our water sources.
The protective tariff — which constitutes the very life blood
of the unexampled prosperity we have enjoyed for the past
ten years — is pictured as the crowning evil, aud its abolition
the greatest blessing that could come to the nation. True,
this is iv accord with democratic preachings of. long ago.
But political parties as well as individuals are expected to
learu something from the teachings of history. Democracy
is not built that way. It is inseparably joined to its idols,
which are strewn in wreckage along the pathway of history.
Articles competing with such as are manufactured by trusts
or combinations of capital are to be placed upon the free list.
The vast aVmy of employes represented by the trusts are to
bs brought into competition with the low-priced labor of
Europe and the Orient. The trusts are to be busted by kill
ing their business, thereby throwing hundreds of thousands
of men out of work. Then, again, the necessaries of life are
to go on the free list. Also lumber and wood products, be
cause it is better to get these things from abroad than to con
tinue to draw upon our native forests. What would become
of own workmen if these tariff reform notions ware carried
into effect democracy sayeth not, and doubtless careth not.
Furthermore, with about everything transferred to the free
list or on a low tariff basis, where is the money to come from
■ to meet the ever-iucreasiug expanses of the national govern
ment. Republicans favor tariff revision, but always along
protective lines. Democrats would slash the tariff regardless
of protection, aud under the plea that our natural resources
should be kept for future generations. If there was the least
idea that such a system of frenzied finance was likely to be
ratified at the ballot box, there would be a period of panic and
distress inaugurated in comparison with whicli the recent
commercial flurry would be insignificant. But there is no
danger that the American people will invite such a dire

MINING BILL PASSED.
We are in receipt of a telegraphic dispatch from congress
man W. F. Englebright, dated Washington, May 21st, stat
ing that the " bill to establish a mining bureau has passed
the house." This outcome is largely due to the indefatigable
efforts of the congressman from this district, who has worked
devotedly to secure this recognition of the miniug industry
at the hands of the national government. There is no doubt
the bill will become a law at the present session of congress.
It will prove a great, benefit to the mining interests through
out the Union.
A dispatch says that the jury in the Rtief case have been
discharged. From this we infer that they failed to asrree
upon a verdict.

SUBSTITUTE FOR DOGWOOD.
Tho supply of dogwood mid per
simmon shuttles in tho Southern
Htates Is nouly exhausted. This
statement will not nppeur signiHcaut
to tbo average man when bo tlrst
hears it. lint when he is told that
(ho entire supply of ehuttlci?, bobbins,
and spindles used in the cotton and
woolou mills in nil parts of tho
country is furnished by tho dogwood
and peisimmou growing in tbo south
ern statos, the soriousnees of the
situation is apparent. The texiJe
mills of the country represent a
capitali?utiou of nearly a billion
dollars, and bobbins, -shuttles and
spindles are just as necessary parts of
theso mills as the throttle is to the
locomotive.
Fortunatoly tho shuttle manu
facturers have found another source
of supply in tho dogwood stnnda in
the far northwest part of the country.
Two large companies manufacturing
spin riles, shuttle's, aud bobbins' have
erected plants in the Cascades in
Oregon, whoso dogwood forests are
the groatest In tho world, tbo tree
often attaining a height of 75 feet and
a diametor of one" to two feet. The
southern dogwood is rarely more than
G inches in di'iinotor. Extensive
stands of dogwood are also found in
California nnd Washington. Up to
tho proseut time, lumbci usors in tbo
Pacific northwest have found dogwood
valueless except for fuel, and its
utilization tor the manufacture of
shuttles will bring about a consider
able increase in stumpage values of
this tree. • *
Theso companies, at their Oregon
plants, will not only manufacture tho
articles named but will utilize ovcry
part of the tree, turning to account
the waste wood aud pioduoing such
by-produols as pyro'igueous avid,
acetic acid, protacetate of iron'
acetate of lime, methylated spirits,
solvent naphtha, wood tar, wood
pitch, and various forms of charcoal.
Dogwood is indispensable in the
manufacture of shuttles, bobbins aud
spindles because it is the only wood
which takes a high polish aud woais
perfectly smooth by friction under
water.
The discovery cf tho adaptability of
the I'acilio dogwood, bowevor, has
not aided tho eastern manufacturers,
and they have been obliged to look
tor substitutes nearer home. Tho
most promising of these are mesuuite
aud tupelo gum. The wood ot the
mosquito is heavy ami very bard,
close grained, and has a compact
structure. It is probable that it
would he emiueutly adapted for tho
manufacture of shuttle blocks, as it
appears to have all the requisite
qualities of weight, hardness, aud
susoontibility to a hlu'li smooth pol
ish. Already it has proven well fitted
for the inanufautiiro of spools and
bobbins for which white birch is now
bo largely used. The tupolo gum is
medium bard und heavy, aud baa a
compact IH.rouH structure. it has
not yet beeu utilizud to much oxteuc
in the textile industries, though it is
quite probable it will play an impor
tant part in tho future, since it com
bines with several necessary qualities
the exacting property nt wearing
smooth by friction.

There is only one way to euro deafneii,

Deafness Is cuused by un inllaini-d con

Good Ctiuso For Tsars.
A certain mediaeval BUltnn had nil tho
mirrors removed from hla palace, so
that he might avoid tho pain of see
ing his o-.vn fnco. This sultan called
on hit) grand vizlo? ono day and by nc-
Cldont happened to patch Bight of his
reflection. Ola bldeousnesu overpow
ered him, and lie broke Into violent
Bobbing, In this outburst tho vizier
Joined, Finally the sultan calmed
down, wiped hla eyes and got ready to
Diao!:a and talk. Bat not so the vizier,
lie gobbed on ijrid on. Illy master, tap
pins hl3 slipper .impatiently on the
cushions, waited lor him [to caase. At
length tiie sultan got angry and ex
claimed:
"Why do you Aveep longer tjian I,
vizier V"
"Alas," the grand vizier relied, "you
wept, O commander of tho faithful,
because you saw your face but for an
Instant, but I see It all day and every
day."
A Dubious Compliment:.
"It looks well, but I am afraid It is
dubious," said a financier, speaking of
a proposed scheme. "Yes, it is dubious.
It reminds me of the Turkish pasha
and his wife.
"A Turkish pasha lay dying. lie
summoned to him the youngest and
fairest of his forty-six wives and said
to her In a low, weak voice:
" Tut on your richest costume, your
most brilliant jewels. Deck your hair
with pearls and brighten your Duger
tips with henna.'
"The young wife blushed. Even in
her grief she was flattered.
" 'And why, my lord,' she said, 'do
yon desire me to make this sumptuous
toilet?'
" 'So that death when It comes,' tho
man replied, 'seeing you so beautiful,
may perhaps carry you off instead of

Motion of tho Sun.
Owing to tho revolution of the earth
the sun seems to rnal;e its dally cir
cuit around us, which of course Is not
the case. But tho sun Is revolving
about Its center quite as truly as the
earth Is. It was one of the conceptions
of that most remarkable man, Sir John
Ilerschel, that the whole solar system
had a motion in space and was ad
vancing toward a point In the heavens
near the star Hercules. Sir John's con
ception—as bold an idea as ever en
tered the human mind— ls now gener
ally accepted by astronomers, and the
opinion is qolto universal among them
that tho entire system is tracing out a
curvilinear path in space, a course
around some mighty center, probably
nt Hercules.
Good Enough to Charge For.
When William 11. Scott was man
aging clerk in the early sixties for the
Qrra of Cleveland & Titus, a client
came in and wanted an opinion right
away. No member of the firm was in.
Accordingly, Mr. Scott, ■with some hesi
tation, wrote the opinion. When his
principal, Mr. Cleveland, came in, he
explained the circumstances and show
ed him the opinion. Mr. Cleveland
looked at him with n smile and then
read it with care. "Humph," said lie;
"pretty poor opinion, but It will do to
charge."— New York Times.
A Caustic Reply.
A gentleman once said to n harrister,
"That was a very good sermon of your

"Yes. lie must havo cribbed it from

this remark and reminded him that the
