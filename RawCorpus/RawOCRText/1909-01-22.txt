JACKSON. AMADOU COUNTY. OALItfOUtfl A, FRIDAY. JANUARY 22, 1Q09.
GRAND JURY REPORT
Jaokaon, Amador Co., Calif.,
•lanunry 20, 1909.
To the Hon. Fred V. Wood,
Judge of tbe superior court of
Amador county, State of California—
We the members nf the grand juiy
duly impaneled at Jttokson February
'21th. 1908, respectfully submit tbe
following report:
We have visited the various oounty
oillcora, and looked over and examin
ed their books to the best ot out
ability, for the limited time at onr
hands, and inquired Into the general
affairs ot tbe county.
We find tbe books ot the various
offices kept in a neat and systematic
manner.
We find' a total of nionov balanoe
on hnud In . the county treasury
amounting to 851)01*2.21, ou January
20th, 1909.
We have investigated criminal
matters and have found 'indictments
as follows for arson :
Ist. Domenico Manzo,
2nd. Agostino Uoiello,
3rd. (ilovHimi liuttiste Marco
Borello,
4th. C. Lepori,
all of which was reported to tbe
judge.
Tbe board tben adjourned to meet
again- on pall of foreman.
On September 21. 1908 the grand
jury met by order of the foreman, all
tbe members present, except T. A.
Cbicbizola, who was excused ' on
account ot sickness. Ou investi
gation we found three indictments
against Jackson Dennis for embezzle
ment, and two Indictments against
fetor Dabbovich for embezzlement.
We have examined the county jail;
we find therein six: persons, two of
who have been convicted of feJony,
whose cases ate pending on appeal.
Three are serving sentences of mis
demeanor, and one has been arrested
for felony, and awaiting examina
tion; and we find tbe jail in a sanit
ary condition.
Tbe grand jury as a body, and a
oommitte which was appointed to
investigate tbe condition of tbe
ooiuty hospital, made their report
to this body, and we Un'd from the re
port* of said committee,' that there
are 47 patients in that Institution, 42
of whom are males, and 5 females;
and that everything is neat and
systematic, and running in good
order. „
We recommend that our representa
tives in tbe California legislature, bo
requested by the county board of
sujgprvis'ora, to so change tbe county
government act, tbat in this county,
gaand and trial jurors be allowed
33.00 per day and their regular mile
age, the same being Uecessary to
cover tbeir expenses.
We also recommend tbat tbe board
of supervisors erect a suitable room
and toilet for tbe exclusive use of
ladies, joining tbe bridge tbat leads
from tbe court house to the hall of
records, and extending to tbe rear of
tbe hall of records; tbls has been a
long .needed necessity, and we oaunot
conceive how tbe people have done
without it.
We renew tbe recommendation
made by tbe grand jury of this, oounty
in tbe year 1905, tbat tbe board of
supervisors investigate and inquire
into the cost of steam beating ap
paratus, or any other, adequate to
beat tbe jail, court house and ball
of records; that it they . find that
safety, convenience and money sav
ing will warrant the expenditure,
tbat they proceed to install the same.
We approve tbe action taken by the
board of supervisors at its regular
general meeting held in January,l9o9,
when it ordered tbe books and ac
counts of tbe various county officer
exported for four years past, and tbe
appointing of a competent acoountant
to do tbe work, who is, we under
stand, experienced in every respeot,
to carry on tbe work to a just solu
tion of the financial and clerical con
dition of tbe affairs of tbe county..
We further recommend tbe purchase
of a maobine for book typewriting;
it would save the cost of a maobine
In a very. short time in ■ books alone,
for the use of tbe recorder's office.
In conclusion, we cannot refrain
from saying a word of respeot to the
memory of our late judge, the honor
able K. C. 'Kust. We mourn his
departure of this life, and reooguized
in him mi able, oapahle and honor
able jurist, h kind and loving father,
and a dear and attentive husband;
one that was never wanting in any of
tbe duties of good oitlzeuship; oiie
tbat bore the respect of bis fellow
man; and one that will ever be missed
by those who oanie in oontact with
him. We extend our coudolenoe to
his bereaved family.
Itespeotfully submitted,
JAB. MKKIIAN, Foreman.

THE SUITER CREEK BANK ,
CRIMINAL CASES.
In our report of tbe proceedings in
the embezzlement obargea againat
Jackion Dennis, as president of -the
broken bank, we unwittingly fell Into
an error. We stated that Indictments
were dismissed on nccount of tbe
arraignment not being had within the
time limit of sixty day* from . tbe fil
ing ot the indictments. This point
was not raised in tbe Dennis cases at
all. It was in the Dabovloh cases,
and as stated waa sustained by the
court in tbe diamissal of those suits.
But in tbe Dennis charges demurrers
Interposed by the defense, alleging
tbat the indictments were Insufficient,
were sustained in two out of tbe three
cases. ■ ' . rf\
It la understood that tho district
attorney will proceed by preliminary
examination in tbeae matters, instead
of calling a grind jury to consider
them. .
Dennis ia still in tbe oounty jail,
having failed so far in procuring tbe
necessary bail bonds for his libera
tion.
Peacemaker Fatally ,
Stabbed In Kennett
Redding January 16.— Caesar Siri, a
bartender in a Kennett saloon, was
seriously and perhaps fatally weqnd
ed In a fight wbiob took place in bis
place of employment to-day. In
striving to seperate two men engaged
in a quarrel be was stabbed over the
heart. In tbe excitement wbicb fol
lowed, bis assailant, who was a total
stranger in tbe town, escaped. Sin
is in a very serious condition.—

The wounded man was formerly a
partner of Quilici in tbe saloon busi
ness in this city. After leaving here
some years ago, be went to Sacra
mento, and there engaged in tbe
saloon business for a while. Tbe
venture was not a success. He is a

Secretary Wilson says: "One of the
objects of tbe law is to inform tbe
consumer of tbe presence of certain
harmful drugs in medicines." Tbe
aw requires that; tbe amount of
chloroform, opium, morphine, and
other babit forming drugs ho stated
on tbe label of each bottle. Tbe
manufacturers of Chamberlain's

tbat tbeir remedy did not contain
any of tbese drugs, and ibe truth of
this claim is now fully proven, as no
locution of them is made ou tbe label.

tbat the cause of death was to them
uukown. When tbe body was receiv
ed at Oakland tbe authorities refused
to issue a burial permit owing to tbe
absenoe of any certificate showing the
oause of death. Mr Potter notified
tbe authorities tbat be was not
authorized to bold an inquest in Oak

•VIHOiIiSIVOGRAFT STILL ON TAP.
Last month the Ledger took occasion to expose a clear
case of graft committed by the Dispatch in a printing bill
presented to the board of supervisors at the December meet
ing. The bill was allowed in full by the board as presented,
notwithstanding its fraudulent character was obvious to any
one with the least knowledge of the printing business. The
charge was for publishing a notice from the tax collector's
office and read in this wise:
Oct. 31 Publishing notice to taxpayers, 18 sq., it - $ 4.50
Nov. 31 " " " " 18 sq., 4t ■ 18.00
Total $22.50
As a matter of fact the advertisement as it appeared in the
columns of our cotemporary measured 4^ squares, and the
legal charge against the county for the same should have
been $4.50, and at that price there would have been a lot of
needless space charged against the county. The exposure of
this barefaced robbery of the taxpayers was met by our
democratic cotemporary — the organ which the last democratic
convention traveled outside of its pathway to boost as worthy
of the support of all democrats —by a screed against the
editor of the Ledger, the purport of which was that the ex
posure in the Ledger was prompted by personal motives of
jealously and spleen; and intimating that when the county
printing was done principally by the Ledger there was no
cry about cutting of rates and all that sort of palaver. There
was no square clear-cut denial of the charge of graft; there
was no disputing the !facts as stated in the Ledger. But
the Dispatch tried to wiggle out of a tight place by endeavor
ing to sidetract and befog the real issue. The claim, like all
other claims against the county, was sworn to — at least so it
appears on its face. The gravamari of our article was to the
effect that the man who put in that bill in that shape, in order
to filch a few dollars out of the county treasury that he was
not entitled to, swore to a statement which he knew to be un
true.
One would think that after such an exposure of grafting
methods, the guardians of the county — the board of super
visors — would be on the alert, and see that the county was
not robbed in the same manner again. Ignorance might pass
muster the first time; they were unacquaintedi with the print
ing business, and were caught napping; but it cannot be
pleaded a second time in extenuation of illegal raids upon the
county treasury. In the face of public attention being call
ed to the very subject, to allow identically the same bill to go
through a second time, and at the very next meeting of the
board, seems to us to assume a more serious aspect than
carelessness concerning the welfare of the county. And this
is what has actually occurred. At the January meeting of the
board, this bill for advertising — the self-same advertisement
from the tax-collector's office — bobs up serenely for the same
grafting sum, but in a slightly different wording. Among
other items of printing the Dispatch bill contains the follow
ing:
Publishing notice to taxpayers, 4t - ■ - $18.00
Now this difference in the wording between the two charges
for precisely the same work is significant. It will be noticed
that in this last bill, while the amount pocketed in dollars is
the same, nothing is said about the. number of squares con
tained in the advertisement. There is no sworn statement
about a measurement of 18 squares. This omission is a
virtual confession of the uubenability of the claim. It avoids
liability for perjury in swearing to a statement known to be
false. It puts the bill on the basis of an overcharge alone, a
demand for $18 when only $4.50 was due, acoording to the es
tablished rates. The ultimate end is reached just the same,
the graft of $13.50 over and above what the printer was legal
ly entitled to. And the officers concerned in this transaction
are placed in the position of allowing a claim without any
statement as to the measurement thereof. They went it
blind, and that too after public attention had been directed
thereto. That is the way the business of Amador couuty is
conducted under the existing regime. It may be a democratic
method of doing things for partisan ends. It cannot be said
that it is safeguarding the interests of the taxpayers. The
advertisement! is still running in^the columns of the Dispatch,
notwithstanding the fact that a legal opinion has been given
to the effect that the law does not require its publication for
such length of time. It will be interesting to watch how far
this expensive farce and tragegy combined is permitted to
proceed.
Congressman Boglebright II being criticised in gone
q latera for introducing a bill requiring that in future Jill
proposed extensions of the forest reserve areas and irrigation
lauds shall be'first submitted to congress, and become opera
tive only upon the approval of thef national legislature. We
see no cause for adverse|eounnent on this proposition. As
far the forest reserves fare concerned, his position is in line
with the views of his constituents in tin's section. We see no
thing out of place in congress^ having the deciding voice in
all such matters.

Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises an area of
648 square miles. It lies on the wes
tern slope of Sierra Nevada mountains,
andemoraces within Its territory all
the diversity of valley, foothill, and
high mountainous lands.
Climate.— The climate of the popu
lous portions of the county U aa genial
and healthful as can be found anywhere
In California. As climate la one of tho
most valuable assets of this favored
state In attracting population, Amador
stands second to no county In this re
« gard. It should, and no doubt will In
time, when its climatic advantages are
more thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, become a health resort not
only for thoso in less favored states,
but for tho residents of other parts of
California. Tho temperature alone the
central portion rarely falls below 30
degrees above zero In winter, and as
rarely rise 9to 100 degrees In tho sum
mer. Snow seldom falls In the settled
districts, and never remains on tho
p round for more than a few hours. Of
courso, In the high mountain regions
of eastern Amador the snowfall is very
heavy — which Is characteristic of tho
entire Sierra Nevada range. The sum
mer season Is alway accompanied with
cool' nlght9; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumbor. Fogs are rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
Infrequent.
Gold Mining.— The county, although
rich in other sources of wealth, com
paratively untouched, is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. The
deepest gold mines in America lire lo
cated here. Tho Kennedy mine Is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
3000 feet below the surface, with every
Indication that tho pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold, the county has contrib
uted fully $100,000000 to tho world's
supply of the precious metal. Tho
mines are still yielding at the rate of
about' two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
eight or ten mines operating on what
is called the "motker lode," stretching
clear across tho county in a north-east
erly direction a distance of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate between
400 and 500 stamps, and furnish em
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
industry is still in its infancy. The
unexplored territory, even along the
main gold belt, is far in excess of tho
ground that has actually been worked
or prospected . The county offers to
cuyoneof the most inviting fields to
be found anywhere in the world for, the
investment of capital in the fascinating
busiuess of gold mining, not alone along
the mother lode, but also in tho almost
untouched mineralized country ot the
east belt, some ten or twelve miles from
the main lode.
Besides gold, we have copper, de
posits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
limestone, granite, and soapstone or
talc— all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities.— The agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce anything that can be
grown in the most favored sections.
In the foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegettiblo are raised where irrigation
is practicable along the numerous water
•courses. Further up In the mountains,
atari attitude of 2000 to 2">00 feet, the
soil is admirably adapted for apples
and potatoes. A ready market for
mauy times tho quantity now raised of
these commodities can be found tin the
various mining towns.
Grape culture and wlnemaking are
becoming important industries, both
the grapes and wino commanding a
better price than .the product of the
lowland.
Land is cheap compared with other
California lands. Improved farms may
be secured for one-fourth the price
current in some places. Unimproved
lands cun be had from 85 to $10 per
acre. ■ It does not require a fortuno to
buy a small ranch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agriculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts now devoted to
cattle ranges might bo made the homes
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amudor has a population of less than
12000. Three fourths of this Is concen
trated in a strip of three miles above
and below the mineral belt.
Jackson, the county seat, has about
2500 Inhabitants, and 1 8 an Incorporated
city ol the sixth class. Other towns
are Suttor Creek, Amador City, Dry
town, Plymouth, Volcano, Pine Grove
and Oleta. lone City is the metropolis
of the valley section, a, thriving town
of 1000 inhabitants.
The community Is law-abiding. Edu
calionul facilities are excellent. A
schoolhouse is within easy reach of
nearly every family. There is one high
school, located at lone.
The assessment roll for 1007 U •*•">.
800, "it, 1 !, und the tax rate for both state
ami county purposes $2 on the $100.
The Southern I'acilio has a branch
railroad running to lone. From this
point the lone and Mas torn railroad ex
tends 14 mill's further to the mining
section.
The various religious denominations
and fraternal orga nlzations uro well

THEIR LAST MEETING.
CY WARMAN
Every morning for a month or more
tho man had come to the gate In the
outer offlce and asked to see the gen
eral manager. Every morning the of
flce boy had given him a blank form to
fill out:
"Mr. A.
"Wishes to seo-Mr. B.
"Business— prlvnte."
As often as the boy went In with the
slip of paper ho came back with the
answer, "Tho general manager is too
busy to see you."
In time the employees learned to
look not at the clock for tho hour of
10, but to the gate that swung In the
low fence. When he had come and
gone thlrfy-seven times, leaving thirty
seven neatly filled requests behind
him, thomannger Instructed tho boy.
"Mr. A.," said the boy and closed the
door of the private offlce, leaving tho
two men alone. The general manager
was embarrassed. Instead of a long
haired, hollow eyed crank, with soiled
linen covering his concaved chest, his
caller was a well dressed, intelligent
looking gentleman.
"Delighted, delighted, Mr. 8.." said
the stranger, advancing with out
stretched hand. "So good of you to see
me! Yes, I did call the other— yes, yes,
I know how busy you are! Just so,
Just so! Ah-h!"
Tho men shook hands hurriedly, ey
ing each other precisely as a pair of
prizefighters enter the ring.
The manager noticed for the first
time a peculiar look in the man's eyes.
"Sit down," said tho stranger, and the
railway man sank back into his swing
ing chair. "I shan't take much of your
time— this time," said the visitor, hook-
Ing one leg over the corner of the table
and sagging into a comfortable; pose.
The manager felt fidgety under the
stranger's soul searching eyes.
"I've got a good thing," said the
man, keeping his eyes upon tho mana
ger's conscience.
"I was afraid of that," said the man
ager half playfully, but the man did
not smile.
"You have some heavy grades on
your line."
"Yes," assented the manager.
"You have doubtless observed that it
is almost invariably upon a mountain
that the air plays out. Just when they
are needed most Is when tho brakes
refuse to work. You know that, don't
you?"
"Yes."
"Well, I've spent sleepless nights
working out a system that will always
work and save millions of money now
lost In wrecked rolling stock and thou
sands of useful lives."
"What is your scheme? My time Is
limited."
"First of all, you shall build for me
a mammoth windmill on the banks of
the Missouri. The ceaseless winds that
come crying across Colorado and Kan
sas vrlll push the paddles in the big
wheel, which, revolving, will drive a
great pump that will force nil* through
ii small pipe to bo laid along tho Hue
under tho ties. Beneath each water
tv::!: upon the mountain side we shall
build an nir tank, so .that while the
firoraan 'takes wator tho brakeman can
take air, filling the air drum with good
valley air, and then there will be no
[rouble. It Is because the ftountain air
b too light to hold that the trains get
away on tho hills. Knowing this, the
Llccd of innocent men, women and
children will be upon your head if you
fall to protect the lives of your pa
trons."
"I'll see you again about this," said
the manager, putting on his hat and
lending the way out through a private
door. All tho way out the man kept
close to the manager. The elevator
dropped them to tho ground floor. The
manager called a cab. As the door
closed the man reached through the
open window into the carriage, press
ed the manager's hand and said sig
nificantly, looking deep into the rail
road man's soul, "You won't lose me!"
The inventor continued to call upon
the manager, every day at first, then
twice a week and later only three or
four times a month.
One evening the general manager sat
In a box at the theater. Between acts
a gentleman who sat almost directly
behind tho railroad man left the box
for a moment. Presently the general
manager became aware that his friend
had resumed his seat and, with his
gaze still on the audience, remarked:
"I lose half tho pleasure of tho play
because of an innate dread of fire. 1
wish somebody would invent some
thing that would put out fire without
drowning people."
"I can do It," said the man at the
manager's olbow."
"How?"
"How do you put out a candle?'
"Well, I would blow it out."
"Exactly. First I would lay a sys
tem of air pipes umler tho building."
Tho manager felt a chill creeping
slowly over him. Somewhere he had
heard that voice before. Ho began
slowly to turn his head, but his neigh
bor put a band upou his shoulder and
bade him listen. "You tremble when
your own life Is In danger," said the
man, '"but you do not tremble for the
hundreds of lives that nro constantly
endangered by your carelessness, nar
rowness and stinginess. On yonder
mountain side tonight people play at
the open door of death as"—
"Abciu!" said the manager's friend,
returning to the box. The wind crank,
teeing that he held the gentleman'!
neat, arose, smiled, bowed and walked
awny.
Always after that the manager cm
rled about wltb him n haunting dread
tit the wind crnnk. He would turn a
corner In a crowded street and meet
him fnce to face, and for the briefest
moment the man would search the
soul of the manager. Once In the city
that was headquarters for the compa
ny they held a great exhibition, and
the general manager was chosen to
welcome tho president of the United
States. The moment he came to the
edge of the platform and faced tho
waiting multitude, waiting not to bear
the railroad man, but the president, ho
became embarrassed. "Ladles and gen
tlemen," he began, "I see before me"—
llere tho speaker paused awkward
ly, like a schoolboy who has forgotten
his lines. Before him rose the gaunt
face of the wind crank, who stood In
the front row, towering above hla
neighbors.
I'ulllns himself together, tho rail
road man went on. Ills friends began
to tremble for him. What he said hnd
nothing to do with the exhibition, the
president or the people there assem
bled. "The company has always en
deavored to keep abreast of tho times.
We have adopted every, safety appli
ance that has been Invented, but so
long as human hands, guided by the
brain of man"—
At that point a man who was Intelli
gent when he was sober broke in on
the orator, "Oh, come offen th' perch
an' let sora'on' talk 'at can talk sense!"
Blushing to tho very roots of his
hair, thl3 local orator, the man who
had been called "the Demosthenes of
the west," stumbled from the stage.
At last the long winter came to'an
end, and the Inventor went away with
the snow. At all events, the manager
had been rid of him for a long while
when one day his special stood upon a
short spur near the mountain top wait
ing for the eastbound overland ex
press. Presently the party were made
aware of the approach of the opposing
train, but instead of the low singing
of the rail, for which they had been
listening, they heard suddenly the roar
of a runaway train and the frantic cry
of a locomotive for brakes. The flag
man who had opened the switch to let
the special back in on the spur stood
there waiting to let them out again
when the express should pass. All the
people had climbed down from the
waiting train to stretch themselves.
The engineer was oiling his engine. The
fireman had climbed up a bank to gath
er some wild flowers that grew where
a little stream of clear cold water gur
gled from the rocks. Seeing the flag
man still holding to the switch, the
general manager ran toward him, call
ing to him to let go and stand back.
What might have happened If the
manager had remained quiet no man
knoweth, but when the flagman saw
him coming and heard him shouting
without understanding what he was
saying he glanced nervously in the di
rection of the approaching train. The
wild engine at that moment rounded a
curve and headed down a short tan
gent straight for the switch. The flag
man was seen to glance back again at
his own train, which stood well in the
clear, then throw his weight on the
switch lever. Over -went the rail for
tho spur, and across It went the flying
train.
An air hose had blown off just as
they tipped over the top of the hill
(this was before the days of tho self
acting, self adjusting automatic air
brake), and the few hand brakes at
the crew's command had served only
to steady the train. They could not
hold the big mountain engine, and now
she shot in on the spur, wide open,
spitting fire and screaming like a wild
fiend. She hit the special with a crash
that shook the very hills. Tho special
train, with Its lighter locomotive, was
driven back three cars or more and
crushed like an eggshell against the
rock cliff that rose perpendicularly at
the far end of the spur. Tho heavy,
3leepers crushed tho mail and express
cars against tho wrecked locomotives.
There were the old familiar shrieks of
the broken engines, the moans of tho
mangled and the excited shouts of tha
rescuers. The general manager had
succeeded In dragging a man from the
ruins and placing him In an easy posi
tion. The man appeared to be quite
dead. As the manager was about to
turn away something tugged feebly at
his sleeve. Tho manager stooped down,
put his ear to the man's breast, peered
into his face and then stepped back
with a startled expression. Now, with
the superhuman strength that some
times comes to dying men, tho wreck
lifted his head and looked with
strange, wild eyes into the face of the
manager.
"Oh, you murderer! Do you still
argue that you can hold a train with
mountain air? Now, with a system of,
air pipes— running up from the valley,
—all this wreck— and— death"—
The general manager put his ear.
down again, but the troubled heart
was hushed. ••"H.-ii,;. ■

AUKUM;
Jan. 18.— Tu the last week a great
storm raged over this region raising
the south fork of the Cosumnea near
ly as high as it was any time during
the winter of 1907. Tbe rain was
warm and vegetation seemed to thrive
beneath tbe sweep of water that de
luged tbe earth everywhere. Tbe llt
tlebridge spaning Salt Creek, about a
mile and a half from Auknm, was on
Thursday last condemned. Super
visor Grilio bad a new one put on by
instructions through tbe telephone,
and new stringers were put in the
place of tbe old ones that had nearly
rotted away. So yesterday evening
teams were again running over' it] as
usual.
On Wednesday evening at about 4
o'olookLizlze Bell Upton, nee Lizzie
Andrews, a former resident of Mt.
Aukum prior to her marriage to. Mr
Upton, died at her residence in the
upper part of Sbenandoah Valley.
For over two years Mrs Upton had
been an invalid, being amost constant
ly under the doctor's care. For
several months she was down at Oak
land undei'.the onto of Drs. Tiffany
jarid Percy of .that city. They found
• sue had tuberculosis of tbe spinal
'marrow, 'which notwithstanding the
'combined 'efforts of the doctors con
torted her limbs and rendered her a
helpess cripple during tbe last days of
her life. Under tbe shadow of this
vicinity she was born, reared and
died. She was born at Diving Bell
Rar on tbe Cosumnea river, and about
one mile and a hallf below what is
know as the Forks, Marob 12, 1863.
Her father having received injuries
upon a baling press, fromw hicb be
died, the family moved up to Mt.
Aukum, where her, mother married the
late John Buckner, of that place. She
lived there, until she. had., passed out
of her 'teens, when she went to live
with her married Bister, tbe wife of
tbe latejllugh H. Bell, of Sbenandoah
valley. While there she met Mr Up
ton, and a little more than eight
years ago married him To them was
born two children, two boys, aged re
spectfully six and five years old.
She was a' good wife and a devoted
mother. She was laid to rest in a
beautiful, white oasket in the Shen
andoah cemetery. Besides her hus
band and two children, she leaves
a mother, two brothers John and Hoi.
Andrews: a half brother Wailliam
Burns and a half sister Nellie Bell,
two nephews and a neice to mourn
her (loss. Notwithstanding tbe in
clemency of tbe weather her funeral
was largely attended. Quite a num
berof Odd Fellows were in attend
ance, her husband being a momber of
that order and she a Rebekah.

ROSS DISCHARGED
ON HABEAS CORPUS
Full Text of the Court's Decision
la the Superior Court In nml for
tbe County ot Amador, State of Call*
fornla.'
Xx parte, William Hoes, on habeas
corpus.
Tbe petitioner rihl one Mary Koss,
were held to answer by a magistrate
of this county upon a charge ot grand
larceny in that they did feloniously
steal a certain deed executed by one
J. I). iMnHiiri to Mary Hiiiliimt, bear
ing date Doc. nth, l!l<)8, conveying
oertnln lots in Han Joaquln county of
tho value ot 8100, belonging to said
Musou.
The. petitioner in default of bail
naa oommitted to tbe custody of the
Hlmrill 1 of ttils county and is now re
httiiined of his liberty by that ottlcer
by virtue of such commitment. It
Is now claimed that tbe petitioner* is
entitled to bis release upon habeas
corpus because he was held to answer
without reasonable or probable cause,
aud iv support of bis contention t he
haa produced tbe testimony taken up
on the examination of the charge.
The grantee in the^deed, Mary ISril
liant is the same person held to
nuswer witb tbe petitioner under tbe
name, Maiy Koss. There is no direot
testimony to show whether she is tbe
wile of tbe petitioner and no object
ions were made to the introduction of
statements made by her npon sucb
grouud. It does appear from such
statements that she referred to the
petitioner as ber husband, nod that
prior to or at tbe time ot drawing up
tbe deed she said ber name was Mary
lirilliant. Whether tbe testimony
proves that she is or is not the wlte
ot petitioner is not necessary upon
this bearing to determine.
In ascertaining whether the peti
tioner should be discharged or re
ojauded to tbo custody of tbe sheritf,
tbis court iti restricted entirely to
the testimony bad and taken before
tbe committing magistrate and that
testimony shows:
That on or about Deo. C, 1908," Mr
Mason delivered to tbe petitioner
aud bis co-aefeudaut Mary Koss or
Mary Jirilliaut, tbe deed in question,
und In payment received trom this
petitioner liis übeok for 810(1. (JO. drawn
on the Bunk of Amador County, and
payable on Deo. 11, 11)08. There is
beursay evidence by Mr Mason stat
ing that two or three days after tbe
delivery of tbe nheck aud before it
became payable he was informed by
an oilicer of tbe bank that there was
no money of petitioner in tbe bank;
that it bad been diawn out; (whether
drawn before or after making the
check does not appear). Mr Mason
nover piesented the check at tbe
bank tor payment either before or
after it became due, because be cays
be was informed by Mrs Koss that
there was no money there.
Subsequently (tbe exact date" does
not appear) Mr Mason says, that
Mary Ross complained to him that
people were saying; be had sold pro
perty that was a duck pond and that
she was crazy. Thereupon be (Mason )
ottered to return the check and take
buck the deed. In pursuance of this
otfer which was accepted by Mary
Koss, Mr Mason sought tbe petitioner
and together they went to the office
of Mr Snyder, whereupon Mr Mason
surrendered tbe check to tbe peti
tioner aud received back tbe deed,
took it home and placed it in a tin
box.
Afterwards and on Deo. 18th,
according the testimony of Mr
Mason, be was offered £300 for tbe
property by tbe petitioner herein—
which otfer was^refused.
It appears from tbe testimony of
the county recorder of San Joaquin
county, that on December 21st he re
ceived by mail from Mr Suyder, a
letter witb the deed in question,
which deed was on the same day re
corded.
Mr Mason never removed tbe deed
from his box nor did he kuow what
had become ot it until be ascettained
it had been tiled for record, nor did
be have auy information as to who or
by whom it bad been taken from tbe
box until Dec. iMth, when Mary Koss
confessed to him that she baa taken
it.
So far tbe only evidence tending
to oouuect tbis petitioner with the
transaction, is: That he gave a cheok
in payment tor the deed to Mary
Brilliant; that at the same time be
aud s Maiy Lirilliant or Mary Koss,
whatever her name may he, received
such deed; that subsequently after
Mary lioss had made complaint to Mr
Mason, that people said she was
crazy, aud that the property was a
duck pond, petitioner went with Mr
Mason to the utilise ot .Mr Murder and
thorn re-c<elivered tbe deed to Mr
Mason and received back his check;
tbnt afterward* and before tha deed
was recorded ho ottered Mr Mason
B'.VM for tho property. In addition
thorn is the hearsay testimony of
Mr Mason to tho effect thut two or
three days before the chuck became
due ho waa told there was no money
there; that it had been drawn out,
aud L in (Mr Mason) testimony that
Mrs Koss had said to him that, tbe
check would not be paid, there was
no moupy there.
It will be observed that Mr Mason
never presented the check to the buna
after It became due, and there is no
showng but what petitioner had
money in tho hunk ou aud at tor Dec.
11th HiiCii'iuiil. to buuor the check. If
he bud uu money ou deposit ou Eaid
day or thereafter it was the duty of
the prosecution to prove it.
Tboro is no testimony to show that
the petitioner had any thing to do
with recording the deed, or that he
even had possession ot the miuih ufter
its delivery tv Mr Mbhou or knew thut
Mrs Koss hail again obtained tho pos
session or that he over performed auy
act In relation to tho deud or Mm pro
perty or ever Bpoke about either BUb
sequent to his otter of 8:i00, tor the
proporty. Outside of the hearsay
testimony of Mr Mosnu aa to what
Mrs Koss livid niul what, the ottloec of
the bunk suld prior tv thu maturity
o( the check, übout theie boitog uu
money there, there is i;ot up td this
time even tbo shadow ot v auspioloft
against this petitioner ot auy mm it I
turpitude, much less his couuectiou
with the commission ot a crltnu.
It wus sought by the people to show
hit participation In tbe offense oharg"
ed by tbe introduction In evidenoe of
tbe oral admlalon or confessions of
hia co-defendant, Mary Koss made on
the 24th day of Ueoember and subse
quent to tbe date of the taking tbe
deed by bet, and subsequent to tbe
dnte of tho reoording of the same.
Tbe question Is not whether the
sworn testimony of Alnry Koss, an
alleged co-consplrator would have
been satllclent to conneot this de
fendant witb the crime as an acaom
pllce— but whether ber statements or
ber confession of tbe orime mid this
petitioner's complicity therein made
to other persona, by her when not un
der oath, nor In the presenoe of t this
petitioner, and after the commission
of the ci line are competent testimony.
Jt appears from tbe testimony that
over the objeotlon of petitioner's
counsel as to its competency and ad
mlHHiliillty witnesses were permitted
to testify; that on tbe 21th of Doceni
ber, and subsequent to the date of re
cording tbe deed, and not in the pre
sence of this petitioner, his co-defend
ant Mary Koss while under arrest for
tbe offense upon which she and this
petitioner were held to auswer said:
"That she took tbe deed out of Mr
Mason's house; that she paid Mr
Mason no consideration; that she
would give him 8100, or she would do
anything If he would get ber out of
trouble; that »he gave tbe deed to her
husband (this petitioner jand told him
to take it to Mr Snyder and have
it recorded; that sbe told her bus
band that she bad paid no money;
thut.hu.know she bad no money and
that all the money they bad was in
tbe Bank of Amador County.
In tbe case of People vs. Opie, 123
Cal. page 295, It appears Cbat the
defendants were charged witb steal
ing gold ore. William Opie was upon
trial and the court allowed evidence
as to tbe appearance, conduct and de
clarations of Edward Opie after tbe
commission of the offense upon the
ground that tbe conspiracy was not
ended because the stolon property
had not been distributed betweeu tbe
tbieyes. The Supreme Court revoked
tbe judgment of conviction upon the
ground that there waa no evidence
that it was ever intended it should
be distributed, or that it. had not
been distributed ut that time.
In this cape at page '2'JU tho supreme
court say: " This court bas bad
occasion many times, aud recently,
to advert to tho error ot similar
judicial action "(People vs. Moore
45 Cai. 19: Poople vs. DilwoodJ \<i
Cal. 89; People vs. Oldham, 111 Cal.
652.)
In People vs. Oldham, 111 Cal. 652.
Tbe supreme court make use of tbis
langauge quoting from People vs.
Moore." it was never competent to
use as evidence against one on trial
for an alleged crime tbe statements of
an accomplice not given as testimony
iv tbe case, nor made in tbe presenoe
of^defendant, nor during tbe pend
ency of tbe criminal enterprise and
in furtherance of its objects. To
bold sucb testimony admissible would
be to ignore the rules of evidence,
settled and everywhere recognized
fioin the earliest times.
in People vs. Winter, 125 Cal. at
page 331 we find the court saying
"Declarations made by liaymond (a
co-conspirator) subsequent to tbe
killing,* not , in the:, presenoe of de
fendant were tbe purest hearsay aud
clearly inadmissible."
From the foregoing authorities it
appears that tbe declaration and
admissions of Mrs Kosa were incom
petent and inadmissible as evidence
against tbis petitioner; that there is
under the testimony no reasonable or
probable cause to commit him upon
the criminal charge, and he is entitled
to bis discbarge irom custody.
Let mi order be entered in accord
ance herewith. ■,

A Hot-Water Market Garden Culti-
vated Near Arctic Circle.
What la perhaps the most remark-
Able farm id the world Is located In
Alaska, on n small tributary of the
Xanana Klver, only 125 miles south of
tbe Arctic Circle. It Is owned nud
managed by J. Il'.I I . Knrshner.
Karsbner n few years ago wan engng
«d in hunting gold when be came
across something which astoutsbod
him very much, it was a littlo stream
of hot water.
lie traced the stream to n eprluj?,
which was likewise hot, aud It pro
setitly became obvious that quite n
considerable armi whs underlaid by
uch spring*.
I'romptly deciding thul this was 11
discovery more profitable tiinn n gold
mine, Kurebuer nnxe up prospecting,
'ml obtnlued a quantity of vegetuble
shml.-i of vHi'ioii.H Kimls.
The tem[ eniture In that region
sometlmo* fulls to 05 degrees below
zero iv winter, but a natural system
cf hot-water limiting, free of cost, was
just tbe thing tor truck gardening
near tbe Arctic Circle, where pota
toes burn a market vnluo of '25 cents
a pouud aud other vegetables briug
prices hi proportiou.
The Knrshuer farm occupies a flat
area with a convenient slant toward
the south. Hot water, oozing out of
the ground, forms three small steams
which empty iuto the near-by river.
The warm spring extends over a
distance of about; a mile, and, as the
owner sayt, "the heat in the ground
has to be felt to bo believed." He
adds: "1 have never seen vegetables
grow as they do here. The place has
a climate of its own. Often there is
no frost when it Is freezing every
where else."
The hot-water farmer has eeveuty
hens. He has also six lino pigs. His
crop ot potatoes this year will be 100
tons, at 350 bushels to the acre.
Tobacco has made a great giowtb.
i'omatoes are a success. Squashes ot
several kinds are grown, some 'of
theiii weighing as much as ~>-i pounds.
Karsbner gets 81 apiece for his musk
jnelons, which are particularly Juicy.
This hot-water market garden must
be a wonder in its way, but it is
donbtful whether its owner deserves
as much credit as belongs to Frank
D. Howard, United States oomiasionar
at Coidfoot, Alaska, sixty miles north
of the Arctic Circle, who in tbe raising
of potatoes and other vegetables tor
market gets over tbe difficulty of
crimate by starting them In tin cans
in the house. When the weather be
comes warm enough he transplants
them to the open.
Mr Howards-market garden is tbe
most successful to be found anywhere
north of the Arctic Circle. tie pro
tects his young cabbages from trott
on cold nights by coveriug'them with
beer bottles, the bottoms and necks
of which have been knocked off. In
these "jackets," as he calls them,
they flourish, and by June 10, when
they have grown sufficiently to fill
tbo bottles they are uncovered. In
the first week of September they are
harvested.
.Mr Howard grows potatoes and
celery very successfully. His lettuce
produces an abundant crop ot large
aud exceedingly tine heads, tender
and aweet.
Last year be sent to the t.gricullural
station at Sitku, by regißt<Mt>d mail,
at a surprisingly early date, a box
containing a oucumber.a sulk uf rhu
rb, lad potatoes and a carrot.
These wore to show what be could do
in tbo truck gardening line. Acoom
panying them was a letter which
said, apologetically:
"1 can not send by mail an H-pound
bead of cabbage or IG-pouud turnip."
It will thus be seeu that tbe busi
ness of market gardening in Alaska,
though conducted under difficult ins,
is not unsuccessful. Some of tbe
finest vegetables are grown on the
loot's of houses, overlaid for the pur
pose with a foot or so of earth.
Ju Central Florida pineapples are
largely grown nowadays uuder sheds,
of lattice. These sheds, elevated on
posts at a height of about 7 feet from
tbe ground, usually, in some in
stances cover as much as ten aores
of land. Their main object is to
protect the growing fruit against
frost, though it is claimed that pine
apples raised under them are more
delicate in texture and of superior
flavor.
| lv Hawaii there is a mountain over
11,000 feet high, along whose side
there gathers every morning a cloud
bank formed by the meeting of air
ourreuts of different temperatures.
This batik remains until late iv the
afteiDoou and affords a shade which
bag beeu made use of in the growlug
of tobacco.
The same Idea has been {utilized iv
this country aud iv Porto Kloo, hun
dreds of aores of tobacco being grown
under cheesecloth stretched over
frames supported by poles.

Wimtlior bee-etlnga are tin effective
ronimly for rheumatism, as baa been
bo otten asserted, seems to be a mutter
of widespread curiosity and unuer
tdlnlty. Dr. A. Walker, of Oxford
University, baa been lately collecting
facts trorn pbyflioiaus anrt others,
and, in addition to popular reports,
be bas obtained some very precise
evidence tbat bee poison really cures
rheumatic pains. Perhaps tbe most
conclusive! report Is tbat. of Dr. Tore,
of Marburg. Styrin. In twenty years
this pbyslnian has used bee stings la
more than 700 oases, and bas found
tbat three or four operations give
immunity to tbe pain and swelling
from tbe btiugs, and tbat a single
treatment may sometimes cure rheu
matism, although old oases may re
quire hundreds ot stiugs. Relieving
that fortnio acid is tbe Hctive ngent,
Dr.' LamarchH bas tried hypodermic
injections of this substauce on rliou
ruatiojpatieuts witb good results. As
this theory does not soem to be con
clusively establisbed, bowever. Dr.
Walker is inclined to attribute tbe
curative action to a neutralizing of
tbe rbeumatia poison by some special
toxin introduced by tbe bees.
Tbe view has Jbeou advanced by a
number ot (Jermau pbysiuians tbat
most people in large cities pass tbe
winter months in a state of chronic
intoxication trom carbonic oxide. J.
P. Laugloia, a French authority, is
inclined to accept this tbeory, and
condomus as unbygienio tbe practice
of beating by bot-air stoves and tbe
use of.gas tor lighting.
The acetylene-lighted buoys of tbe
Swedisb coast keep in action 71) days
without renewal of the single tubes
of 50 liters of dissolved acetylene.
Ingenious automatic lighting makes
this possible. A bright reflecting sur

gas, but at night tbis action ueases,
tbe valve opens, and tbe gas, auto

The now tunnel-boring machine of
X b\ Terry of New York, and O. S.
Procter of Denver, is a kind of gig

chisel-headed hummers. It is expect
ed to prove capable of doing some
thing like 2UO times the work of an
ordinary air drill, with one-tenth of
the proportionate power, and a reoent
test indicated tbat an 8-foot tunnel
could be driven through granite 72
lineal feet in 20 hours. The cost ot
removing 5,000 oubio feet per day is
estimated at S3OO. Tbe machine de
signed has au 8-foot dull head, with
25 hammers, which are arranged to
cut in concentric overluppiug circles,
so tbat tbe lock will be clipped away
over the entire face ot the excavation.
The rock fragiueuts are caugbt in
steel pockets andearriod to the rear
by a conveyor. The frame of the
machine is mounted on two trucks,
the forward one of the two wheels and
the rear one ot the four, the latter
running on a 22-iuch gauge truck,

drives the whole machine forward.

FRIDAY JANUARY 22, 1900
LOCAL EDITORIAL COLUMN.
A BILL TO REGULATE MINING.
Assemblyman Rutherford of Nevada county has introduced
a bill iv the assembly providing for the appointment of an in
spector of mines, with the alleged object of securing the better
protection of persons employed in underground operations.
It was introduced January 12, and referred to the committee
on mines and mining. By the favor of assemblyman Moore,
we are in receipt of a copy of this proposed law for the regula
tion of the mining industry. We do not believe from a curs
ory examination of its provisions that the bill will meet the
approval of those engaged in the business of mining. Its main
object appears to be to provide snug berths for three more
state officials, namely, an inspector at a salary of $2400 per
year, and a couple of deputies at $1500 each, with all travel
ing, and incidental expenses besides. The 'purport of the
a'c£ seems to be'humauitarian, namely, to see that every mine
employing not less than five men is properly equipped with
machinery, properly ventilated, and competently handled as
far as the protection of the lives of employes is concerned
This is truly a praiseworthy motive, but the question is would
the measure accomplish this end, or would its tendency not be
to retard rather than advance the business of mining in this
state. It is a false assumption that mine owners are careless
or indifferent about the safety of the underground workers.
0n the contrary, they are fully as careful to provide against
accidents as . railroads or other large .employers of labor.
Mining is a hazardous business anyway, but the risks in
separable therefrom are rarely augmented by indifference or
heartlessness on the part of the owner. This' bill provides
that upon receipt of a complaint in writing, vertified and
signed by three or more persons—presumed to be employes —
a miue is dangerous in any way, or the machinery inadequate
or dangerous, or any person in charge of any machinery as
engineer or otherwise, is unskilled or incompetent, the in
spector is required to visit such mine, and make a thorough
examination into the charges. If in his opinion the charges
are 1 valid he' must notify the management to make the neces
sary"changes" without delay, or discharge incompetent em
ployes within ten days after receipt of a written notice to that
effect. In case of an accident within three months after the
receipt of such notice, failure to comply with the inspector's
demands shall bz construed as prima facie evidence of gross
neglect in any action for damages that may be, brought
against the mine .owner.
The inspector is required to visit once a year as many
mines as possible in each county, and is empowered of his
motion to order such changes as he may deem advisable to
insure the safety of the workman.
In case of a serious or fatal accident the inspector must be
notified, and visit the scene, and inquire into the causes there
of.
These are the salient features of tbe proposed law. Our
assemblyman is no doubt anxious to know the sentiments of
his consituents iv regard to the measure. And we take this
opportunity of explaining its provisions so that those con.
earned may take prompt action in stating their views to the
representatives^ this assembly and senatorial diatrict.
Congressman Englebright has introduced a very important
bill bearing on hydraulic mining, the tendency of which will be
to foster that system of mining in places where the anti-debris
law has proven an insurmountable barrier. This bill provides
that the quantity of debris likely to be deposited in a naviga
ble stream by a mine applying for a permit to commence
operations shall be ascertained by a United States commis
sion, and the company or individual seeking permit to mine
shall have the privilege of removing from said stream a quan
tity of debris equal to the quantity assessed by the commission
as the estimated amount that would reach the stream, or the

Calling n Muff isn't always the he

Good advice Is
a most excellent

It is nlwnys wnll to etart an investi
gating committee to work when the
hitherto negligent small boy develops
a sudden love for school.
It-all depends whether It pn.vs to be
tactful or not. If you are a grent big
brute you probably get your results by
walking right over everybody else, and
It delights your selfish soul a grent
deal more to take them that way.
If you are go

ber that you will
have to pay it
back with inter

your enemies and
not your friends.

In going through a busy street
Or down a quiet place
It's nice to meet a pretty girl
Who has a smiling face.
For, though you know your chance is

To win her as a flame, .
It sort of brightens up the day
To meet her Just the same.
There may be pictures on the wall.
There may be sunsets rare,
There may be landscapes stretching
wide
And to the eye most fair.
But as for sights that really please
, A creature In a frock
With winning ways has all of them
, '• Pushed neatly off the block.
See as she trips along the way
With light, elastic tread '
Bhe turns the neck of every man
And likewise turns his head.
Though for appearance sake the stiu«
Is modified a bit.
■They'd like to follow her away
Did custom but permit.
There's nothing In the world can lenrt
Rich color to the scene
JCor brighten up a dreary day
Lilt.! dainty Miss Sixteen.
She comes and tosscu back her head
In challenge pert, though prim.
And man confesses to himself
That she looks good to him.
Seemed Far From Home.
"How did you like the restaurant?"
"It was just tolerable."
"I am surprised to hear you say It
They spare no expense there in getting
