When Frogs Are Best.
Frogs' legs are sold In Paris daintily
threaded on little willow wands. Peo
ple buy them for the home table in
stead of, as is the practice In this coun
try, eating them exclusively in restau
rants. They make a most palatable
broth for invalids and convalescents,
but ordinarily the legs are prepared by
removing the skin, rolling them In.
flour, adding salt pepper and butter,
with a pinch of parsley, and cooking
them gently In a frying pan or on the
griddle. By Parisians it is considered
that the frog is best in the fall of the
year, when it Is fattest and most deli
cate. However, large numbers of the
batrachlans are caught In the spring,
when they are said to be more .easily
captured.— Saturday Evening Post
Thought It "Was Bargain liny.
Mr. Closefist had been out walking.
He returned home tired and cross.
"Just what I might have expected," he
whined. "I gave the only 10 cents I
had in my pocket to a beggar, and it
started to rain, and I had to walk
home. Don't ever talk to me about
the rewards of Providence."
"And did you suppose Providence
would postpone a shower of rain," his
wife asked, "because you gave 10 cents
to a beggar? You weren't expecting
much for your money, were you?"—
New York Commercial Advertiser.
An Ariatocratlc Grain.
Could plants lay claim to aristocratic
position, as representing an old family,
rice might safely claim to be of tbe
most ancient pedigree. It is the earliest
cereal known. Originally a native of
India, it has crossed the ocean and
made a home for itself where heai
and moist soil could be found. It grows
in all warm portions of the globe and
furnishes the principal food of nearly
one-third of the human race.
This would be a much more peaceful
world If lots of grown up people as well
as children could only be seen and not
heard.— Chicago News. '
Forests cover one-tenth of the sur
face of the earth and one quarter of

Ton Taste With Your Throat.
The idea that the sense of taste has
any connection with the throat appears
peculiar at first thought We have been
possessed with the notion that the
sense of taste lies in the tongue and
the palate. We all speak of a fine pal
ate, and many persons express aston
ishment that they can enjoy a delicacy
as well after having had a plate fitted
to their mouths by a dentist as they
could before they paid a visit to that
clever gentleman.
The sense of taste is not confined to
the tongue and the "palate, but is more
widely distributed. You taste also with
the epiglottis, that little valve at the
base of the tongue, and the larynx., to
which the epiglottis acts as an assist-,
ant also takes part in the process.
Concerning the palate, it is noteworthy,
that we taste with the soft part which
is at the back of the mouth, but not
With the hard or front palate. That ex
plains the mystery of the dental plate.
The tonsils do nothing for the sense of.
taste, nor does the uvula."
What the Indian Eats.
The typical Indian, home of today
consists of a mud chinked log shack, a
tepee or two, usually a hay bnrn and
sometimes a corral. As a genual" rule,
they live in squalor, yet many Indians
possess nice homes and enjoy well
cooked meals from neatly set tables. 1
But the ordinary Indian . eats meats
largely of questionable character. He
delights In dog stew and other savory
dishes. He has excellent teeth and an
envied digestion.
Indian children are shy and close
mouthed to strangers, but the squaws
are often loquacious. Their doors are
always open to visitors. The red man
has an aversion for soldiers and frank
ly tells them that he does not fear
them. Although he possesses an excel
lent constitution, disease finds in the
Indian an easy victim.— Detroit Free
Press.
"Jiinnc Giggle" Falls.
"Some years ago I visited an old
friend of mine in Minneapolis," said a
well known Milwaukee railroad man,
"and he spent considerable time taking
.me about to show me the many inter
esting places in that interesting city.
One day he took me out to see the fa
mous Mlnnchaba falls, and after I had
feasted my eyes on this beautiful work
of nature he invited me to accompany
liim down the gulch through which the
little stream flows— at least half a mile
—and there called my attention to a
little cascade that is an exact minia
ture of Mlnnehaha falls.
"'What do you call this cascade? I
asked of my friend.
" 'We call this Minne Giggle. 1 "—Mil
waukee Sentinel.
The Artist and the Critic
Sidney Cooper,' the English artist'
happening one day to visit the Royal
academy, where some of his works
were on exhibition, while a couple of
critics were examining the pictures,'
strolled up to where they were stand-
Ing. At that moment the younger of
the two critics exclaimed, "Any ma
chine could turn out sheep like that!"
Mr. Cooper put his hand in his pock
et, produced his card and, handing it to
the newspaper man, said, with gravity,
"If you will kindly send that machine
to this address when completed, I'll
send a check for $1,000 to the institute
for decayed journalists!"
Soup by the Pound.
In China liquids are sold by weight
and grain by measure. John buys soup
by the pound and cloth by the foot A
Chinaman never puts his name outside
his shop, but paints instead a motto or
a list of his goods on his vertical sign
board. Some reassuring remark is fre-:
quently added, such as "One word
hall," "A child two feet high would not
be cheated." Every single article has
to be bargained for, and it is usual for
the customer to take his own measure
and scales with Mm.
The Heat of Australia.
Australia is the hottest country on
record. I have ridden for miles astrido
the equator, but I have never found
heat to compare with this. Out in the
country in the dry times there appears
to be little more than a sheet of brown
paper between you and the lower re
gions, and the people facetiously say
that they have to feed their hens on
cracked Ice to keep them from laying
boiled eggs.— Sydney Telegraph.

Censnre and Criticism.

THE DESTRUCTIVE TEREDO.
A Curious and Fragile Worm That
Digs Tunnels Iv Timber.
It was In 1731 that Holland narrow
ly escaped Inundation along its coast
because the timbers of the sea dikes
In many parts were discovered to be
quite unsound. : The timely discovery
of the real condition of the dikes saved
the country from an awful catastrophe,
the full extent of which was com
prehended by only a few Dutchmen.
The timbers had been honeycombed,
by the teredo, or shipworm. This
creature burrows Into any wood Im
mersed in sea water. It makes an en
trance when young and digs channels
along the grain ' of the wood, living
and often dying in the timber. Tbe
worm grows ,-rln some localities to a
length of twelve Inches, Its girth be-J
Ing one and a half Inches, and the'
curious thing about Its whlpllke body?
Is Its exceeding tenderness. It cannot
bear Jts own 'weight. It will bix~a!« 'If*
subjected to any strain. .. , :
\lt will burrow straight along .the
grain of the wood unless turned aside
by a knot or nail, and, no matter how
many of these worms may be burrow
ing In the same piece of wood, -they
never run their channels Into one an
other. By some marvelous Instinct
they keep clear of each other's pre
serves. We have recently seen a cross
section of a log eighteen Inches In
diameter, and we counted no fewer
than SOO distinct burrows.
The Saving Sense of Humor.
Some of the world's greatest humor
ists unite with that sprightly gift a
deep tenderness and broad sympathy.
Their lips smile at a spectacle of the
absurd at the same instant that their
eyes overflow In recognizing the pathos
that Is Its so frequent accompaniment
It Is this quick perception of a situa
tion as a whole, this power to see' all
Its aspects at once, that gives us just
judgments tempered by me'rey, severity
lined with leniency, that acts as a sav
ing grace to culprits. }. ..
The world would be better and hap
pier If everyone In It who Is Invested
with authority over his fellows had
this peculiar sympathy with wit, which
makes It Impossible for oue to be a
bigot and a tyrant. Humor and cruel
ty do not go together, although there
Is a kind of counterfeit humor, some
times mistaken - for tbe real thing,
which Is essentially oppressive, be
cause It finds enjoyment in looking
upon that which Is at tbe same time
grotesque and horrible. But this Is
far removed from the gentle humor
which mellows their judgments and
humanizes actions. — Florence Hull
Wlnterburn In Woman's Home Com
panion. .
Old Saws and Sayings.
A few old sayings on the subject of
food come to us rather as a surprise
in our age of daintiness and refine
ment yet they have their ralson d'etre
notwithstanding. "Meat is much; man
ners are more;" "Cease your chatter
and mind your platter;" "The ass that
brays most eats least;" "The wing with
the liver to him who's the giver;" "He
can give little to his servant who licks
his own trencher."
Apropos of this remark, it Is amus
ing to note that "manners" was the
name given to the remnants of a meal.
These came to the servants as official
perquisites; hence l our well worn ex
pression before emptying a dish,
"Leave the last 6lice (or whatever It
may be) for manners," though If votes
were collected on this point It Is hardly
likely that any of us would have taken
It as it stands In the original.
Ko Thanks Due.
A minister went from Kansas City
down Into the country to preach. Be
fore going Into the pulpit he asked if
any one Interrupted with "amens" and
other ejaculations, as he could not
stand such Interjections. He was told
of one old woman who always made
herself heard at all good points. Slip
was asked on this occasion to desist,
and she obliged for once. At the end
of the sermon the minister met her
and 'warmly thanked her for holding
her tongue.
"No need to thank me, no need to
thank me!" she exclaimed. "You said
nothing whatever to make me shout!"

JACKSON CAL
LI HUNG CHANG'S WIVES.
The First One, Though Alive, Was
Looked Upon as Dead.
5 The one romantic complication in the
life of the late Machlaveill of. China,
LI Hung Chang, Is amusing or tragic
according as one may choose to look
at It
Earl LI early in his distinguished
career took a wife. During the Tat
plng rebellion his wife had to fly to tht>
Interior for safety, where she lived for
many months without communicating
with her husband. The Chinese states
man meanwhile, thinking his wife bad
perished with other victims in the mas
sacre, enllstetl the sympathies of tbe
emperor, who ordered a , magnificent
funeral. The empty coffin was follow
ed to the grave with all pomp and
ceremony of state by LI Hung Chang
and;. representatives of the emperor..
After a period of mourning LI Hung
O'umr took unto himself another wife
aud settled down again" to domestic
felicity.
: Then the first. wife appeared. She
had narrowly escaped ,the massacre
and had been living with her family.
Mrs. Chang No. 1 took exception to
Mrs. Chang No. 2 "and wished to be
reinstated as principal wife, for the
law of China does not allow polygamy.
Li Hung Chang was In a great stew.
In despair he applied to the emperor.
The emperor said Mrs. Chang No. 1
had been accorded a state funeral.
Therefore, to all Intents and purposes,
she was dead, and he advised his min
ister to Ignore her, which be did. As
women are treated as mere chattels In
China, the first wife did not demur,
but went buck to her family, among
whom she died.— New York World.
"Stuffing a Cold."
The man who originated the oft
quoted maxim, "Stuff a cold and starve
a fever," either did not understand
what he was writing about or he has
been . widely misunderstood, to the
great Injury of multitudes who have
acted upon the absurd maxim.
Presuming that the author of It was
a physician who knew something of
the nature of colds and the action of
remedies, he must have spoken sub
junctlvely and not Imperatively, and
then it would read thus: "If yon stuff
a cold, the consequence will be that
you will be thrown Into a fever as a
result of the stuffing treatment of tbe
cold, and then yon will have to starve
the fever."
This is a true and sensible Interpreta
tion of this commonly received maxim,
which has done as much barm as any
of the thousand aud one popular er
rors which prevail on medical subjects.
Without dwelling on the nature or
causes of colds or on what physicians
call tbe pathology of these disorders,
we will say that a low or even starva
tion diet for a few days, with the free
drinking of warm, mildly stimulating
teas, is better for a cold than any drug
or combination of drugs.— London Fam
ily Doctor.
Wheat Does Not Grow Wild.
The existence of names for wheat in
the most ancient languages confirms
the evidence of its great antiquity and
of its cultivation In the more temperate
parts of Europe, Asia and Africa.
From the evidence adduced by botan
ists of high standing. It seems highly
Improbable that wheat has ever been
found growing persistently In a wild
state, although It has often been as
serted by poets, travelers and hlsto
rlans.
In the "Odyssey," for example, we
are told that wheat formerly grew In
Sicily without the aid of man. Dlodo
rus repeats the tradition that Osiris
found wheat and barley growing pro
miscuously In Palestine, but neither
this nor other reputed discoveries of
wheat growing wild seem at all
credible, seeing that It does not ap
pear jto be endowed with the power
of persistency, except under continued
culture.
How Kan and Nature Use Oases.
Man uses the same elementary gases
as nature does, with others that she
does not employ with the same Inten
tion. Both use oxygen for sustaining
combustion, but nature nses It system
atically for construction, which man
does not Man uses hydrogen for com
bustion, as nature does, but not for
construction. Man takes advantage of
nitrogen for concentration of energy.
Nature takes the same advantage, by
which nitrogen, though negative, be
comes the most important of vital
structures. But she does more. She
makes nitrogen constructive as well
as concentratlve, an art man has not
attained.— Longman's Magazine.

The complexion always suffers from
biliousness or constipation. Unless the
bowels are kept open the impurities
from the body appear in the form o!
unsightly eruptions. De Witt's Little
Early Risers keep the liver and bowels
in healthy condition and remove • the
cause of such troubles. C. E. Hooper,

The Birth of the Cicada.
Even ; when warm weather comes
again and other cicadas sing gayly
from their trees the subterranean exile
remains within tbe ground, daily grow
ing larger and stronger until a second
winter has come and. gone. Then a
stranger restlessness possesses him,
and, burrowing steadily upward, he at
last emerges from his long retirement
on some warm, moist August morning.
A rough, horny, earth colored creature
he is, with strong hooked feet and
bulky body. Clumsfr Is he also, and,
staggering along, he . gropes blindly
about for some perpendicular, object
up which he laboriously begins to
climb.
Presently a slight quiver shakes his
form, and a little crack opens a-down
his back. It seems almost as if his un
wonted exertions had actually burst
his horny shell as the gaping wound
reveals a mass of damp material with
in. Slowly the split widens, and a
broad and massive head equipped with
two great shining eyes pushes upward
through the opening, and we realize
that the birth of a cicada is taking
place.— Frank Leslie's Monthly.
Cat Both Ways.
A farmer's boy In Scotland was
charged with attempting to steal an
article from a shop door. In pleading
his case he said he didn't steal the
tiling— "he was only gaun tae dae It"
Whereupon the judge informed him
that to do It and going to do it were all
the same and that he would have to
pay a fine of 10 shillings or go to jail
for ten days.
The boy, not having the money, was
allowed to go and get It from a friend.
In a little while he was seen standing
In the court, and when asked if he had
got the money to pay his fine he an
swered:
"Na, but I was gaen tae dae it, and
ye said that gaen tae dae It and dae it
were jlst the same. I'm thinking you
and me'll be aboot clear noo."—Pear

Superstitions of Today.
There are villages near the Universi
ty of Oxford where no notion of med
ical science has penetrated and where
charms are the only recognized cure
for disease. A woman who has lately
been lecturing in the neighborhood on
sanitation found that whooping cough
was always treated by spider. The
spider was sewed Into a piece of mus
lin and hung on a curtain rod, and the
death of tbe spider meant the end of
the cough. Not long ago a child was
seized with the illness, and the doctor
ordered "poultices on the chest" "When
he returned, be found that the mother
had carefully laid the poultices on the
oak cheat which stood by the bedside.
The remedy appeared to her perfectly
natural. . •
Conscience Stamps.
The postoffice department has a "con
science fund" of its own. Not at all un
usual is it for people to use a poorly
canceled stamp and then to regret
cheating the government out of 2 cents.'
In order to secure peace of mind the 2
cent culprit will send a good stamp to
the department with an anonymous ex
planation. This stamp is turned over
to an official of the files and mails di
vision, who pastes it on a large card
and . draws a couple of pen marks
across it The effect would be just as
good if the repentant canceled the
stamp himself.
The Rantuekvet Dialect.
A family circle in Nantucket was
once discussing the use of nautical
phrases when the mother said, "Girls,
I never use them." \ ■
"Yes, thee does, mother." ,

Thumb Rings.
Men's thumb rings are no rarities to
collectors. Some of the Roman speci
mens must have been cumbrous wear,

ing the" bust of Trajan's consort, Plo
tlna, measuring over three inches
across. Medlseval churchmen of high
degree did not allow "the largest first
and shortest of the fingers" to go una
dorned. A massive gold ring was found
upon the thumb of the supposed skele
ton of Hilary, bishop of Chichester,
who died In 1160, and the recumbent
effigy of Bishop Oldham in Exeter ca
thedral is remarkable for the pressed
together thumbs being inclosed by a
single ring.

Becket was robbed of its treasures, the
famous archbishop's thumb ring, given
to him by the king of France, graced
with a ruby the size of a hen's egg,

Building Superstitions.*
In remote times a sacrifice of some
kind was always offered at the comple
tion of a building, either public or pri
vate. Sacrifices were not only offered
at the completion of structures of all
kinds.' The foundations themselves
were usually laid in blood, whether the
structure was a castle, bridge, cottage
or'church. Originally— tracing the sub
ject back to heathenish times— the sac
rifice was offered to the god under
whose protection tbe building was
placed. In Christian times the bloody
rite was retained, but was given anoth
er significance. In .those days it was
generally believed that no edifice would
stand unless the cornerstone was laid
In mortar mixed with blood. Usually
the blood was obtained by sacrificing
a dog, a pig, a wolf, a black cock or a
goat, and not unf frequently some male
factor's blood was poured out to make
the ceremony more Impressive. ■.
' Clark Russell's Start.
When a young man of one and twen
ty, Mr. Clark Russell,- the well known
novelist, was present at the trial of a
dozen seamen who had mutinied be
cause the food provided for them was
of the most abominable description. He
was disgusted to find that the muti
neers were actually sentenced to sev
eral weeks' Imprisonment for refusing
to be poisoned with the provisions dealt
out to them. From this sprang the idea
of a story of mutiny caused entirely by
the shipment of bad food for the crew.
The result was "The Wreck of the
Grosvenor," by which Mr. Clark Rus
sell made his name. ,
A Corkscrew Steeple.
The steeple of the parish church at
Chesterfield, England, Is often called
the "corkscrew" steeple, for It has got
quite a big twist This is dne to the ac
tion of the sun on the wooden and iron
materials, and the warping is more pro
nounced in the case of Chesterfield
church than in any other church in
England. Barnstable and Bristol and
one or two other places have leaning
steeples, but their tendency is decided
ly, to "lean" and not to "twist"! The
church at Chesterfield is the nearest
rival In the United Kingdom to the
leaning tower at Pisa.

Deafness Cannot Be Cored
by local application, as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear.
There is only one one way to cure deaf
ness, and that is by constitutional re
medies. Deafness is caused by inflam
ed condition of the mucous lining of
the Eustachian tube. • When this tube
gets inflamed you have a rumbling
sound of imperfect hearing, and ' when
it is entirely closed deafness is the re
sult, and unless the inflamation can be
taken and this tube restored to its nor
mal condition, hearing will be destroy
ed forever; nine cases out of ten are
caused by catarrah, which is nothing
but an inflamed condition *of the
mucous surfaces. '■•■.'■ ••-***

Things He Didn't Understand.
At the table on an Incoming liner on
a recent trip one of the first cabin pas
sengers found in an oyster one of the
tiny seed pearls ; which look almost
exactly like bird shot Apparently the
formation of pearls was a mystery to
him, for he examined the thing curious
ly, picked It up gingerly and laid it on
the tablecloth for further Investiga
tion.
Now, It Is a habit of cooks at sea to
carry fishhooks In their] pockets, and
on this trip, by a curious coincidence,
part of a small hook got caught in a
piece of beefsteak that was served to
this particular passenger. As soon as
his knife encountered the hard object
he started, picked it out carefully and
laid it beside his other find on the
cloth.
Then he beckoned to the waiter and
confidentially whispered in his ear.
"I don't want to be impertinent" he
said, "but would you mind telling me
where you shoot your oysters and why
you catch your steaks with a hook and
line?"— New York Post
Famous Abductions.
Marriage by abduction was by no
means uncommon In the . early ages.
The daughter of . the king of Argus
was ' abducted by a Phoenician. . The
Greeks carried off. Europa from Tyre
and Medea from Colchis.
Next to the abduction of the fair
Helen, perhaps the most remarkable
In Its political consequences was the
King of Leinster's taking away of the
wife of a neighboring petty sovereign,
O'Rourke of Breffni.
The king of Connaught avenged the
Insult and drove from the throne his
brother of Leinster, who appealed to
Henry 11. of England for aid ; to re
cover his lost sovereignty." The Nor
man conquest of Ireland followed, with
long centuries of war and devastation.

you live elsewhere than In his city.

too much Chicago. A New Yorker pub
licly proclaims.lt that when you get a

you really cease to live and are simply
camping out That Is the result of too
much New York. A Bostonlan says
nothing, and you understand his mean-
Ing perfectly.' You realize that he la I
not saying whole volumes to you, and
you are powerless to dispute a word
of It. Yon have a feeling that he is
pitying you because you do not know
that Boston is all there Is.— Nixon

Tortoise, Shell.
What Is known as "tortoise shell"
consists of the thin outer scales which
overlie the shell of a species of . sea
turtle. The shelling process consists
In spreading dried leaves or grass even
ly over the back and then setting them
on fire. The heat causes the shell to
separate at the Joints, but does not in
jure It A large blade Is then inserted
horizontally between the. laminae,
which are gently pried from the back.
Many turtles do not survive the proc
ess, but most of them live and get a
new covering, Just as a man will grow
a finger nail in place of one he may,
lose.

CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
A number of constitutional amend
ments will be submitted to the
voters at the next election. Every
legislature brings to the front a
formidable array of would-be con
stitution menders. Most of the
proposed changes go into the waste
basket by the short route; and the
majority of those submitted are
relegated to oblivion at the ballot
box. As a rule the people are
averse to changing the fundamental
law at the bidding of every incipient
statesman who aspires to the place
of law-giver. While {here is 'ample
time to look into the merits of the
pending amendment to the organic
law, it is not amiss for the voters to
post themselves early on the subject.
One amendment proposes to take
in the high schools in the division of
the state school money now devoted
exclusively to the support of the
common schools. This is an insidi
ous movement, and one that de
mands serious thought. At first
blush, it will perhaps be hailed as a
step in behalf of more liberal educa
tion, and therefore worthy of sup
port. Closer investigation, how
over, is apt to change one's mind as
to its merits, and brand it as one of
the most radical measures ever sub
mitted. We herewith publish the
proposed amendment in full:
Senate Constitutional amendment
No. 4 amends section 6of article 9, to
read as follows:
The public school system shall in
clude primary and grammar schools,
and such high schools, evening schools,
normal schools and technical schools as
may be established by the- legislature
or by municipal or district authority.
The entire- revenue derived from the
state school fund and from the general
state school tax shall be applied ex
clusively to the support of primary and
grammar schools; but the legislature
may authorize and cause to be levied a
special state school tax for the support
of high schools and technical schools,
or either of such schools included in
the public school system, and all
revenue derived from such special tax
shall be applied exclusively to the sup
port of the schools for which such
special tax shall be levied.
What effect will the passage of
such an amendment have upon our
school, system? From its wording
there seems to be no limit to the
number of the schools that might be
organized in conformity with this
provision. The tendency to extrav
agance in expenditures when it
comes to dealing with state funds is
well known. Every little district
having sufficient census population
to constitute a common school, would
want to be in the swim and have a
high school department. They
would want to have the educational
advantages of the cities, on a smaller
scale of course., As the law now
stands the community having a high
school must support the same by a
special tax on the assessable prop
erty in the district. This is a whole
some law. It curbs the disposition
to multiply these schools beyond
actual requirements. The danger is
that with high schools supported by
state tax, these .institutions- will
become as common as the common
schools. In fact they will become
part a.nd parcel of the common
school system. Probably not more
than two per cent of the children
attending the public schools take
the high school course. The majori
ty of those who do so have no
definite end in view in so doing.
The passenger department of the
Southern Pacific Company has just
issued a little booklet entitled,
"California for $25." It contains
short articles from t.he best writers
of the state, setting forth the varied
resources of the state, with the view
of attracting immigration. The
railroad company is doing splendid
work in advertising California.
Hundreds of thousands of these
booklets will be circulated in the
east, more particularly in the states
that furnish the bulk of the settlers
coming to the Pacific coast. After
all that has beeu said of the beauties
of our favored state there still exists
in the mind of the average citizen in
the older sections of the country, a
dense ignorance concerning Cali
fornia. The impression seems' to
prevail that it is a good place for
the health-seeker, but not for" the
wage-earner or the man who is
ambitious to make a home. The
truth is California has inducements
to offer in every department of
human industry not excelled by any
other state in the union; and the
foothill region, of which Amador
county is a fair sample, is the equal
of any part of our favored state.
We want more people. Population
means wealth. No matter how rich
a country may be, without the pop
ulation necessary to open up its re
sources, it must remain poor. The
organized effort to_ advertise the
northern and central portions of
California marks the dawn of a new
era, which cannot fail to leave a
lasting .impress for good upon
this matchless land.
OILING ROADS.
The question of the use of oil on
the highways has been freely dis
cussed in Amador county . as else
where, but after all there are points
in connection therewith that are
still unsettled. In some places it
has been pronounced a success, and
failure has marked experiments in
other localities. The supervisors of
Yolo county recently took a trip
through San Joaquin, over the oiled
roadways there, and the result of
their^investigation is thus reported
in the Yolo Mail: ••""■;
"Of course, in 60me parts of the
State the experiment has not been sat
isfactory, but in all of thoso instances I
think the failure was due principally to
the lack of proper conditions, especially
so in Sacramento county. The San
Joaquin board has demonstrated % be
yond a doubt that, at least, on some
soils splendid results are obtained by
oiling roads when"conditions are right
In the vicinity of Stockton oil has
been applied on roads of sandy soil and
adobe. The best results were obtained
on the former. The oil saturates the
surface to a depth of a few inches,
forming a solid compact coatin" not
unlike asphaltum." Mr. Hoppin here
exhibited a sample of road crust he
brought with him from Stockton,
which is like, what he described, a
piece of asphalt. "On tho adobe soil
the experiment has not been so satis
factory, but is successful, and a first
class road can be made.
"The supervisors of San Joaquin are
so thoroughly pleased with the experi
ment — so far they havo only experi
mented — that this summer they will do
more of it, or thoroughly finish the
work partially done, and will take off
several water sprinkling carts. They
will also oil roads for a stretch of thirty
miles. When considering the fact that
San Joaqiiin gets its water cheaper— it
is pumped with windmills— than most
of the other counties of the State and
that they will practically abandon water
sprinkling in favor of oil, it shows con
clusively that there at least the sprink
ling with oil is considered better and
more economical."
Tub Amador Record tries to con
sole itself over the defeat of the in
corporation scheme in Sutter Creek
by saying that the result was due to
the fact that the non-property hold
ing class voted against it, while the
taxpayers were in favor of it. If
such was the case, it is just the re
verse of the conditions that existed
in Jackson when the same issue was
settled here a year ago. We are in
clined to think that our cotemporary
is mistaken in the staiement. We
believe the bulk of the property
owners in Sutter Creek fought and
won the battle in Sutter Creek as
they did in Jackson. It is uphill
business to make the people believe
that by increasing the machinery of
government in such towns as we
have in Amador county, the cost of
government will not be increased,
or that 'the efficiency of the govern
ment will be increased. Experience
is all against both propositions, and
experience is a better guidfe than
prophetic utterances.
A nice point has cropped up in
Stockton in connection with the
position of health officer. They are
just recovering from an epidemic of
smallpox in the slough city. The
law allows the health officer a salary
not to exceed $50 per month. The
question has arisen, what duties are
required of him for this salary. . It
is conceded that he is required to
diagnose a case, and see that quar
antine regulations are enforced.
But the Stockton health officer
claims that it is not within his of
ficial duty to treat the cases', and' if
he does so— and he has done so in
many instances — the city is re
sponsible for. his fees. Suits are
about to be commenced to decide
this question.

FINAL HEARING 'NEAR
Argonaut-Kennedy Cue' Goes Before Fed
eral Supreme Court. •
■- - - . *- . ■ o
Tho extended and important litiga
tion between the Argonaut and Ken
nedy mining companies will soon come
up for final hearing before the United
States isupre'me court.- Curtis n. Lind
lej has'iilready I'eft for Washington to
deliver the 'argument in behalf of the'
ArgonautJ' and John Garber is expect
ed to depart in a few days in order to
present the Kennedy's side of the dis
pute to tho august tribunal. The com
panies are coterminous mining proprie
tors upon the same vein or ■ lode, v tho
top or apex of which passes through
the Pioneer or'-Argonaut mino into the
Kennedy mine in Amador county. . In
addition the Kennedy company Owns
property in the vicinity known as the
Silva mine, and the controversy has
grown out of the mining of ore by the
Kennedy* company below I the surface
of this part of the Kennedy possessions.
The question is a very nice one in min
ing law, asr it involves the questions of
end lines and extralateral rights. ■■It is
further complicated by the fact that
the end lines of the Argonaut property
are not" parallel. :, Reduced \o its closest
limits, the case presented to the United"
States "supreme court is "this: ■'The
Argonaut, as the 'proprietor 'of a' pat
ented mining claim having withrt its
boundaries the apex of a vein, insists
upon its ownership of that vein
throughout its entire depth 'within
vertical planes drawn through its end
lines, and those lines produced in
definitely in the direction of the dip, as
against the "Kennedy, which owns a
part of the apex of the same vein, • the
end line between thorn being a common
one, but which has crossed beyond and
out of the common' end-lino boundary
and taken and reduced the ore, assert
ing its right to do so by virtue of its
ownorship of the Silva mining claim.
The decisions thus, far rendered haVo
been in favor of the Argonaut' Mining
Company.— S.F.' Chronicle. ; '

'When you are about to buy a suit

to a carpenter's shop. When in

on the blacksmith to prescribe for

appear that to buy a ; suit there is
but one place, and that is the tailor
shop,' where your suit can be fitted
on you before being made up; and
where you can select your goods,
not from a piece of scrap on paper,
where in nine cases out of ten when
your suit arrives it isut at all what
you selected. If you buy it home
you can select your goods from a
large assortment of piece goods, and
can see what you are getting for
your money. .Your ready made
suits are pressed and remodeled with
no extra charge; 4his I guarantee.

immediately, however, and while not
having sufficient capacity for the num

THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MARCH 14, 1902.
Jackson Republican Club.
The regular monthly meeting of the
Jackson republican club was held in
Webb hall last Monday evening.
There was an attendance of between 20
and 30 members. It had been an
nounced that a "smoker" would be'
the attraction of the meeting, but at
the eleventh hour, owing to the ab
sence of several who were depended
upon to furnish entertainment for the
evening, the social part of the program
had to be postponed. The committee
appointed to make arrangements had
exerted themselves in every way, and
the failure was owing to. matters be
yond their control.
A motion was therefore carried
unanimously that the "smoker" be
held on Monday evening, March 24, in
the usual place of meeting. -
The particular business before the
club was the selection of delegates to
attend the state convention of repub
lican clubs to be held in San. Jose on
April 14. The apportionment of dele
gates was one delegate at large for
each club, and one for every 25 mem
bers. With a membership of 190 this
would give nine delegates for the local
club. Nominations were declared in
order.
R. Webb nominated Senator John
F. Davis as delegate at large. There
being no other nominations the sec
retary cast the ballot of the club ac
cordingly, and he was declared elected.
For the .eight other delegates the
following were elected: Dr. A. M. Gall,
R. Webb, J. B. Francis, Neil A.
Macquarrie, B.F. Taylor, C. H. Free
man', A. C. Barrett, J. S. Garbarini.
Alternator— J. W. Caldwell for dele
gate at large, A. L. Stewart, Web
Smith, C. F. Parker, W. E. Kent,
Fred Eudey, W. M. Fuller, Rule
Parker and S. G. Spagnoli.
If any member of the club who was
uot present at the' meeting, would like
to attend this gathering of the repub
lican chieftains in the garden city, ■he
has only to make his wishes known to
be accommodated, as but few of those
elected will be able to attend in person,
and they would be pleased to give
place to others who would go.
A communication was received from
S. M. Shortridge, one of tLe selected
orators of the coming, convention, in
acknowledgement of an official letter
from the secretary of the club.
Bun Over by the Train.
A fatal accident occurred last Satur
day morning as the train was about to
leave the lone depot. A man named
Peter Lavella, whose home is said to
be in San Francisco, was endeavoring
to.secure a ride by the cheap route —
by tackling the brake beam. It proved
the last and costliest ride of his life;
the price he paid was life itself. In
trying to get on the beam while the
train was in motion he fell, and the
cars passed' over both legs, mangling
them in a terrible manner. Surgical
aid was promptly summoned from
lone, and amputation was resorted to.
The shock was too much for the system
to withstand, and the victim died
before the operation:. was completed.
He had boen working in the livery
stable of J. Muldoon in lone for a
while, and report has it that he quit
and was about to come to Jackson to
seek work, but changed his mind and
concluded to go to San Francisco. He
was a young man of about 25 years of
age, and was highly thought of by
those who knew him. No inquest was
held, as the case was too plainly an ac
cident due to the victim himself. The
remains were taken to San Francisco.
• Mischievous ' Boys.
The small boy gets in his mischievous
work not only on telephone and elec
tric light wires, but also on the water
supply of the canal. He is a factor
that has to bo taken into consideration
by the water company and the ditch
tenders. Some time ago j one of the
largest mills in the county was brought
almost to a standstill by his enterprise.
The millman finding his supply of
water reduced to almost nothing, tele
phoned to the ditchtender to know
why he did not turn on a full supply;
The ditch man answered that the full
complement of liquid was passing
through the gate under his control.
Thfs led to an investigation, and it
was found that some meddlesome
youngsters had shut off the water by
stopping up the overflow at the gate
from the reservoir with rocks. For
years the canal company have been
compelled to have the gates regulating
the flow of water to the various mines
chained and padlocked, to insure a
steady and adequate supply. ■ Prior to
this precaution the boys, in the
thoughtlessness and recklessness of
youth, would tamper with the gates,
to the annoyance of the company and
loss of the mining companies. With
chain and padlock however, this
source of amusement to the small boy
is shut off.
The New Bridge.
, The new bridge spaning the Middle
fork of Jackson creek on Pitt street,
was placed in position Saturday and
Monday. As^aras a novice in such
matters can judge it is a neat and sub
stantial structure, equal in every re
spect to bridges put up by firms who
make a specialty of such business. It
was all made in Jackson. Of course
the steel had to be imported. It is
from the Carnegie works at Pittsburg.
The floor of the bridge was all laid by
Monday evening. Considerable work
remains to be done in the way of filling
in the approaches. Indeed the piers
and filling in are- more expensive than
the bridge proper. Eight or ten feet
had to be filled in on either side. No
travel can be had over the bridge until
this work is completed.

Superintendent Hyner of the Mitchell
mine has secured a twenty stamp mill,
which will be added to the present
milling capacity as 800*11 as* possible.
This will make 30 stamps in all. This
speaks well for the mineral outlook of
this district. Mr. Hyner is a careful
manager, and it is a safe conclusion
that the underground developments
fully justify this large increase of
stamps. The mill has been crushing
rock for 18 months, with gratifying re
sults. Improvements in the shape of
additional machinery are continually

NEW PROCESS FOR REFRAC
TORY ORES.
An Immense Step Forward if Fracti-
N. W. Mahaffey of Stockton has
been in Jackson for the past week, for
the purpose of demonstrating the prac
ticability of the Wiest process for "the
extraction of gold from refractory ores.
The claim for this method is, that re
bellious ores too poor to pay for ship
ment to sinulter, may be treated by
this process on the ground at a cost of
$3 or $4 per ton, with an extraction of
gold and silver of over 90 per cent.
It will be readily seen that if this claim
can be substantiated by actual working
test, it will prove an incalculable boom
to the mining industry of almost every
gold producing country. The ores of
the mother lode are principally of a
tree milling character. But in the
mining belt to the east, especially in
the Pioneer district and around West
Point, gold ores are met with in abund
ance which cannot be successfully
treated by the ordinary mill process.
The cost of shipment' to smelters and
the charges' for treatment would under
present conditions absolutely shut out
all ores carrying less than $30 per -ton.
Now if such ores can be treated on the
ground at. an expense little if anything
in excess of the free milling ores of the
main belt, many mines now idle would
start into activity, and become profit
able to th,eir owners. ' r .\'i.
The inventor of the process is a Colo
rado, man, but Stockton parties are
said to have secured the right for Cali
fornia. . A smelter of this pattern has
been erected in Tuolumne county, and
is about ready to start up. W. G.
Phipps, of the Stockton Metallurgical
Works, will take charge of this smelter.
He is in Jackson now for the purpose of
assisting in the tests of the process here.
THE METHOD EXPLAINED.
The process may be briefly explained
as follows: The ore Is first j crushed to
an - impalpable powder by the dry
method. About an equal weight of
clay is added, mixed with some chemi
cal, the cost of which is about 30 cents
per ton of ore. The secret of the in
vention lies in the nature of this chemi
cal. 'After roasting for 'two hours
only, all the refractory materials which
would prevent free amalgamation are
either driven off by heat or absorbed
in the clay, and from 90 to 95 per cent
of the assay value saved. The econ
omy consisting* in the reduction of
labor and fuel in the treatment as com
pared with the chlorine process with
sulphurets. That method requires
roasting for 24 hours, whereas the new
method will admit of 12 treatments
within the same time, or six times the
quantity of gold bearing material
operated upon. While for the main
belt the process is adapted for sul
phurets only, as we have stated before,
the refractory ores of the eastern belts
can be treated, provided however, they
are rich enough to warrant the reduc
tion charges of $15 per ton, which must
be admitted is a pretty steep tariff,
almost as prohibitive as shipment to
smelters outside the county.
Oh Wednesday afternoon Messrs.
Phipps and Mahaffey conducted a series
of tests at the Zeila assay office, which
was kindly placed at their service by
Mr. Detert for these experiments. A
number of gentlemen were present, in
cluding George Gates, Mr. Hoover 'of
Amador City, Mr. Meikljohn of Sutter
Creek; J. A. Greenwood, Dr. P. B.
Aiken and others. Five or six tests
were made ou different ores; silver ore
from the claim of Dr. Aiken at West
Point, also sulphurets and' tailings
from the Zeila, also ores from the
neighborhood of Pine Grove, submit
ted by T. C. Barrett. None of the
samples were roasted for more than an
hour. Gold and silver were liberated,
but whether the percentage claimed
was secured could not be ascertained
from the necessarily imperfect nature
of the tests.
The only smelter of this kind in the
state is the one just erected at Sonora.
It is not yet in operation, but will be
in a few days. Those interested talk
of putting up a small furnace ' in Jack
son, and show the applicability of the
method for sulphuret ores. If a suc
cess it would dispense with chlorination
works, as the sulphurets after being
roasted can be dumped into the, mill,
and the gold caught on the plates or in
the batteries. - -

MINING NOTES.
Central Eureka.— The addition
of 20 stamps to the mill is making sat
isfactory progress, but it will 'be some
time yet before it is ' ready to start.
They have to wait for the installation
of a larger electric motor of one hun
dred horse power— double the capacity
of the present motor. Electric power
for the Central Eureka is found to be
more economical than water. There
is little water pressure available as the
works are located near the summit of\
Sutter hill, and at 20 cents per inch
the water power runs up into money
fast. Electric energy Is just as steady,
and reliable as water, and will no
doubt be the motive" power for all
mines started in Amador county. The
ore is being extracted from the 2000
foot level, and there is plenty of it to
keep a 40-stamp mill in motion. '
Bunker Hill.— At this mine pros
pecting operations continue with little
change to report. At the 800 level
fairly good ore has been uncovered in
the bottom of the drift. How much
there is of it cannot be told from the
work that has been done. Since the
present company started work they
have expended $90,000 in development
work, besides paying $30,000 for the
property, making $120,000 in all,.
Nearly all this money has been fur
nished by local investors.

The Wildman Mining Company.
, On the 13th instant there was filed in
the co\inty clerk's office a certified copy
of the articles of incorporation and
other documents relating to the Wild
man Mining Company, operating at
Sutter Creek. The company was
organized under the laws of Maine in
1886, with a capital stock of 24,000
shares at $10 each, with the following
list of stockholders: I. O. Whiting,
Boston, Mass.; J. Tregloan, Alameda,'
Cal.; A. R. Mitchell, Newton, Mass.;
J. F. D. Garfield, Fitchburg, Mass.;
and W. H. Emerson, Cambridge, Mass,
all having one share each. In Decem
ber, 1886, the stockholders voted to
increase the number of directors from
5 to 6, and in October, 1892, stock, was
reduced to 25 cents per share, and the
number of shares increased to 30,000.
According to the documents filed the
product of the mine to October 13,
1892, amounted to $54,426.40 from mill,
and $22,509.88 from the sulphurets.
The object of filing theee documents
in the county where the real estate is
located, at this late date— sixteen years
after the organization of the company
is probably to meet the requirements
of the state constitution, which de
clares that no foreign corporation shall
do business in this state under more
favorable conditions than companies
1 organized under state laws, and all state
incorporations are required to file
articles of incorporation in the county
where the property is situated.
A Bad Break.'
The worst break in the ditch that
has occurred this season took place on
Wednesday in the vicinity of Slaughter
house gulch. The heavy rains have
loosened the top soil, and in places
where the canal is built with the steep
side-hill above, disastrous slides have
taken place. JThe company have done
their utmost to mininize the danger.
They have gone to the expense of
planking the top of the flumes for long
distances at exposed points, and also
of bracing the sides. On Wednesday
a large portion of the side-hill slid,
destroying both" upper and lower
ditches, and effectually shutting off the
water. The mines and mills depending
on water power were brought to a
standstill. Lights were also out Wed
nesday and Thursday nights. A strong
force of men is at work repairing the
breaks, and everything will be in run
ning order again in a short time. The
company intends to guard against these
slides in the future as much as possible
by slucing off the loose dirt from the
steep banks over the line of the canal.
A Sad Affliction.
We have to chronicle the death of
Mrs Ellen Bailey under peculiarly sad
circumstances. She gave birth to a
child on the 9th instant. Mother and
child appeared to be getting along
nicely. On Thursday evening Mrs
Bailey was seized with a severe vomit
ing spell, and death resulted in three
hours thereafter. In the opinion of
Dr. Endicott, who attended the case,
death waa caused by Internal hemor
rhage due to the rupture of a blood
vessel by the strain of the vomiting
speli. The husband and other rela
tives have the sympathy of all in their
sad affliction.

Volcano, March 8, 1902. '
Editor of Amador Ledger: —
By your permission I 'will . con
tribute a few thoughts on the above
subject. My remarks are not intended
individually, but simply, in a general
way, and without any personal feeiing.
There has been a good deal of dis
cussion on the matter of - good roads.
It will be remembered, not many years
ago, the road work was in the hands
of officers known as roadmasters, and
the people got sorely vexed at the
manner in which the roadmaster did
his work. As soon as he was elected
he would, it was said, begin election
eering and planning to hold his job.
After discussing the matter pretty
thoroughly, it was thought a reform
was possible by dropping the road
master and leaving the roads in the
hands of the supervisors. The people
were led into' a snare. It was.never
supposed that the supervisors wouJd
have full sway at the road funds, but
would superintend the work; would
contract for the work and after it was
done, if it was found up to the stand
ard, they would simply order the bills
paid, not even being allowed to handle
the money. What is the result. Sad;
wo have jumped from the frying pan
into the fire. Many believed we would
be benefitted, but we have consolidated
supervisor and roadmaster and created
an office coveted by all— an office Xh&t
is considered worth spending consider
able money to win. So I contend that
there should be a guard rail placed
round the county's strong box. There
is one little guard that should be torn
down, thrown over the fence, and
trampled under foot. That is the
Caminetti electioneering expense law.
The intention might have been good,
but it accomplishes nothing. It looks
as though some of the officers would
blush with shame when they see their
expense report put in print, so I think
it should be pulled down or put up in
some shape that will prove effective.
The board Vof supervisors have too
much power. There is nobody to
question their . road bills. They are
simply audited. -No one knows from
the published proceedings where the
money goes to. The supervisor draws
it, but he is not the beneficiary, as the
law distinctly prohibits that.
In regard to the proposed new • road
of the Amador Lumber Company. I
have traveled the country over and it
is the opinion of nearly every one I
have talked with that the company
should have a right of way. They
should have the right to build the road
with their own money also, as they
comprise some of the wealthiest men
of the county. lam told by soipe of
the men living in the section where the
road is to pass through, that the coun
try is, and has been opened with roads
for years, but good roads are a . boon
to any county, and the' horrible con
dition of our roads is more for lack of
a proper system than anything else. I
believe if the people had their way
they would build roads with some of
the money that has been squandered in
times past for Native Sons' celebra
tions, mining engineers, printing great
register, and settling technical points
in school laws. The people have a well
paid official to look after their legal
business. The district attorney i -is
quoted as saying the . bill. for
attorney fees in the school
tax case . was illegal. Now
what are you going to do with this?
Give it a good coat of grease I suppose,
and have the people swallow it. I
believe most of our officers are too well
paid. You may ask why. Because
there is such an anxiety for office the
list of candidates on all sides go all over
the county throwing money like mud.
Do they do it because they love their
country or isit because t»ey love votes?
The system builds up a big saloon
business and tends to lower the moral
tone of the community. This practice
is a disgrace to be very much regretted.
Is there no remedy? I say. there is.
Let every man constitute himself a
committee of one and stamp it out.

Death of J. K. Sibbetts.
J. K. Sibbetts died in the county hos
pital during Wednesday night. He
was taken to that institution about two
weeks ago. He was then in the final
stages of consumption. He had been
around Jackson for several months,
struggling to earn his own living in
spite of the inroads of the dread disease,
which were only too apparent to every
one who saw him. As long as he was
able to keep on his feet he refused to
go to the hospital, and after entering
there he was anxious that his serious
condition should not be made known
to his relatives, on account of the
anxiety it might cause them. Of
course the authorities notified relatives
in San Francisco of his illness, and a
brother cape up a few days thereafter
to take him home. His weak state,
however, rendered It unwise to make
the trip, and his brother left last Sun
day morning without him, hoping that
he would regain sufficient strength to
undertake the journey in a short time.
But he steadily lost ground, and died
as above stated. The body was shipped
to his relatives in the city.
Amador Postoffice Burglarized.
The postoffice at Amador, which is
kept in J. R. Dunlap's drug store, was
burglarized last night. The burglar
effected an entrance through the cellar
door in a shed in the rear of the build
ing. From the cellar there was no
difficulty in getting into the store
proper. The cash register of the drug
store was ransacked and robbed to the
tune of several dollars, but no other
valuables were taken. There is no
clue to the perpetrators.

HYPNOTIZED. •
An Exhibition of the Ocult Science in
Jackson.
Professor L. M. Lamott, an exponent
of palmistry, hypnotism and clairvoy
ance, has been in Jackson during | the
past week, and has given . some re
markable exhibitions of , his power
along these mysterious lines. He ia
from Chicago, and while palmistry—
the science of reading a person's char
acter and past and future life from the
lines on the palm of the hand — is his
principal business, he is also an adept
in hypnotism and kindred sciences.'
j He held a private seance in the Na
tional hotel parlor on Tuesday evening
and also on Wednesday, both occas
ions being attended by a number of
invited guests. On both occasions
attempts were made to hold communi
cations with the spirits of departed
persons; but without success, which
result Prof. LaMott attributes to the
skepticism of several participants.
Hyynotism was then tried with a
number of persons with more or less
success. A number partially responded
to the efforts of .the" professor, assisted
by Dr. Endicott, but the trouble seem
ed to be in their inability to concen
trate their mind for a sufficient length
of time, or a voluntary resistance to
the influence, which in either case will
cause a failure. The best results were
secured with Messrs. Mahaffey, Head
and Smith, who endeavored to make
the meeting a success and allow a num
ber of people to witness a practical
demonstration of hypnotism. Of the
three named subjects the latter prob
ably gave the best response. While
under the influence he gave a very
convincing explanation of the principles
and merits of Tontine Saving Associa
tion's contract, which company he
represents. After convincing a profes
sional gentleman present that the in
vestment was' a good one, he wrote a
contract . for him and demanded the
payment, which was however deferred.
He also gave a repetition of the work
in his former days of teaching school,
rendered a selection on the piano, imi
tating Padereweski. Next he exercised
his horse Dick, putting him through
his . paces to the amusement of the
crowd, and obeyed the instructions of
the professor in many ottier interesting 1
performances. Mr. Mahaffey was
equally successful and amusing in as
many different ways. Mr. Head res
ponded very readily on the first even
ing but declined to take part on the
second. All present seemed well satis
fied with the professor's work in hyp
notism. On Prof. LaMott's return to
Jackson, one month hence, he will jive
a hypnotic entertainment in the hall.
Mesmerism and hypnotism, although
closely allied, and manifestations of the
same mysterious force, are terms used
to distinguish different methods of pro
ducing the same result. In mesmer
ism the operator passes the hands over
the forehead and before the vision of
his subject, and brings him under the
influence by actual contact. In hypno
tism the mental forces alone are
brought into play to bring about the
result. And while mesmerism may be
exerted upon an unwilling subject,
hypnotism, on the other hand is in
variably brought about with the con
sent of the subject, who can in every
instance, if he so wills, defeat all efforts
to bring him under the hypnotic spell.
Again an idea prevails that both
mesmerism and hypnotism are mani
festations of the power of a strong
mind over a weak one. This is an
error. They depend upon concentra
tion of the mind, and "concentration in
itself is an element of mental strength.
Professor LaMott frankly admits that
he cannot explain the power. He
knows he has it, and that it is a real
force, with nothing of the fake about
it; but beyond this he knows no more
about it than the subject who readily
responds to the subtle influence.
A Horrible Outbreak.

ter's head developed into a case of scald

Obituary.
Zachariah Stephen Kirkwood, a pion
eer of Amador county, died at his
home, three miles south of Jackson, on
Thursday night, March 13. He has
been a sufferer for many years from
kidney troubles, but until within a few
days of his death, was able to get
around and attend to his business. He
was a native of Ohio, aged 72 years.
In his departure another well-known
landmark has been removed from our
midst. He was one of the early set
tlers, and was known by all tourists in
the mountain resorts of Amador and
Alpine counties as the genial host of
the Kirkwood hotel on the border of
Alpine county. For the past thirty
years or more he has conducted this
resort every summer, and established
a reputation as an entertainer that
made his place famous as a resort of
pleasure and recreation. He was a
man of strict integrity and honor, and
a host of friends will sincerely mourn
his death. He leaves a widow and
three children — two sons, George and
Walter, and one daughter, Alva, the
youngest of the family, aged about IS
years.

Useful Men.
A well known Philadelphia society
woman said the other day:
"I have come to separate the men of
my acquaintance into three classes.
There are the dancing men, the dinner
men and the corner, men, and each has
his own place on my list. For instance,
I would never think of depending upon
dancing men for a dinner. The danc
ing man is generally callow, and he
iloesn't know much else besides danc
ing. On the other hand, the dinner man
seldom dances, but he is a good talker,
is superficially informed upon the light
er topics of the day— the opera, drama,
the latest novels— and can more than
hold up his epd. He doesn't allow con
versation to lag, and consequently he
is an important factor at a dinner. Men
will accept dinner invitations quicker
than invitations of other kinds, but
ilon't think from this that they are all
dinner men. Par from It.
"The corner man? Oh, he is the one
who has the knack of making himself
generally useful and is quite in a class
by himself. He looks after the comfort
of the chaperons, runs handy little er
rands and can even be depended upon
at afternoon teas. The other men don't
think much of him, but he has_ his own
value from the feminine point of view."

Emperor Honors a Dragon Fix.
The oldest extant poem about a drag
on fly is said to have been composed
1,440 years ago by the Emperor Yuria
ku of Japan. One day, while this em
peror was hunting, say, the ancient rec
ords, a gadfly came and bit his arm.
Therewith a dragon fly pounced upon
the gadfly and devoured it Then the
emperor commanded his ministers to
make an ode in praise of the dragon
fly. But as they hesitated how to begin
he himself composed a poem in praise
of the insect, ending with the words:
Even a creeping Insect
Walts upon the great Lord;
Thy form It will bear,
O Yamato, land of the dragon fly!
And in honor of the dragon fly the
place of the incident was called Aklt
suno, the moor of the dragon fly. —

which accounts nor Its universal adop
tion In Turkey, | and Constantinople In
particular, is as* follows:
Philip of Macedon laid i siege to the
city, in the year S4O B. C.\ He chose a
night of unusual darkness) for theypro
posed^ssault, out was foiled byHhe
moon suddenly; breaking ifrom behind
a cloud. In, commemoration of , this
providential < deliverance the crescent
was adopted/ as the symbol of the city.
The Mohammedan sultans -^ere slow
to assume rthis emblem' until some one
mentioned^ that it was the. symbol of
increasing/ greatness, power changing
as rapidly/as the phases of the moon. ■;

"You can never tell what a Jury will
do In the way oft awarding damages."
said a lawyer. "Some ; years ~ ago I
happened to be fpresent at a meeting
between a man ftijured In the big rail
road wreck on the Lake Shore, at Ash
tabula, and representatives of the road.
The man asked $25,000, and the rail
road had offered $17,000. The man
told his story, and' lt was a , terrible
one. It seems; that he was caught In
the wreck and/held by one foot, which
was plnionedjtlown. The wreck caught
fire, and the /flames crept toward him.
Firemen and; others around saturated
his clothing with water and placed
wet blankets over him, but he 'was not
released until his foot was burned off.
It was a grewsome story.
"One of the directors of, the road was
present. He took the claim agent aside
and said: 'Give that man $25,000. If
he tells his story In court, he will get
damages enough to put the road Into
the hands of a receiver.' He got the
money."— New York Tribune.
Comes That 'Way.
A young minister who was naturally
of a shy disposition was rather embar
rassed at .his first marriage ceremony
and unwittingly reversed the usual
order of the service, thus making the
bridegroom promise to love and obey
his blushing bride. . The error passed
unnoticed at the time, but shortly aft
erward it dawned upon the father of
the bride that a mistake had occurred,
and he said to the minister: •
"I believe, Mr. , you have made
John promise to love and obey my
daughter. Ah, well," he added after
a pause and with a sly look at his bet
ter half, "I suppose It won't matter
much. It generally comes to that any
way."—Pearson's.

A Story of Stevenson.
Robert Louis Stevenson was \par
tlcularly attached to the "v" in' his
name and utterly averse to the "ph"
form of spelling. Letters of admiring
autograph hunters did not often draw
him, but one day in Samoa a letter ar
rived containing praise so judicious
that he said, "That I must answer."
Then his eye caught the envelope, ad
dressed to R. L. Stephenson. "Step
hence, Step-hen-son!" he cried and,
crumpling the offending missive, flung
it on the fire. * I

Flora—What a lovely ring!. And it's

Some Remarkable Beliefs.
There are naturalists in this day and
age who. believe that horsehairs will
turn to living snakes, that toads will
live for thousands of years In the cavi
ty of. a rock without food or water,
that the barnacle goose wasideveloped
from the shellfish of that name and
that the bird called sora Is atspecies of
winged frog. "^
A Killer.
Maude— Gaskell thinks he.is a regu

Esther— l shouldn't wonder. I had to

MARITIME EXPRESSIONS.
Cued In «. Metaphorical Sense, The?
Are Quite Common,
Maritime , expressions, used meta
phorically, are, In fact, very- common.
We say a couple are "spliced," a young
man Is the "mainstay" of his family,
an Intruder "puts his oar in," the mem
ber from WayJ^ick "steers through,"
a man Is "hard up."- sometimes "taken
nback" or has "the wind taken out of
his snlls," a toper Is "slewed," a loafer
"spins a yarn," sometimes "tries the
other tack," and a ruler '.'steers the
ship of state" through troublesome
times.
■ This last metaphor Is extremely an
cient, by the way. Horace refers to
Rome as a ship at sea, and Plutarch
says the • Delphic oracle referred to
Athens in the • same way. A Tamil
saying embodies a like metaphor, "The
soul is the ship, reason is the helm,
the oars are the soul's thoughts, and
truth Is the port." An old collection
of English proverbs contains this one:
"The tongue Is the rudder of our ship."
A Malay maxim says, "The boat which
Is swamped at sea may be balled out,
but the shipwreck of the affections Is
final.". A>;
Aristophanes, Plautus and others use
an expression which comes down to
us as an English saw, "To row one
way and look another." An old Eng
lish proverb (1614) was, "It Is not good
to have an oar In every one's boat"—
United Service.
"Lifting the Kin*."
One of the picturesque English coro
nation j ceremonies^ which j have . been
discontinued Is that of lifting the king.
In. the old days the monarch always
slept at the palace of Westminster on
the night before the coronation. The
regalia, j which are still, technically
speaking, in the dean and chapter of
Westminster, were brought by them to
Westminster hall in preparation . for
the ceremony. These • were arranged
on a long table, the crown, the scepter,
the spurs, and so on. .The king when
he descended from the palace to West
minster hall was lifted by his nobles
on to a marble chair. . ;• . ...
The lifting of the king Into this chair
was a survival of the old Saxon custom
of carrying the king on his shield. The
custom survived up to the time of the
coronation of , George IV. When the
monarch was seated In the chair, he
at once directed by pointing his finger
which . of his nobles should carry the
various parts of the regalia to the ab
bey, and the procession began.—Lon
don Tatler. ; '
Whir He Waa Rejected.
The soul of a rajah who had been
released from the cares of this world
and an uncongenial . wife presented
himself at the gates of paradise.-. '
! "Have you been in purgatory yet}"
demanded Brahma. ' •
"No, but I have been married."
"Enter then. It is the same thing."
At this moment another soul arrived,
who begged Brahma to allow him also
to enter. • . • • \<
"Softly, softly. Have you been in
purgatory yet?" , •  .
"No, but neither has that other fel
low. He died the same day I did."
"Very true, but he had been mar
ried." <•*;; '--
"Married, indeed 1 Why, I have been
married three times." : ■ ' -
"Away, then, to the lower regions!"
said Brahma sternly. "Paradise is not
made for Imbeciles."
A Man's Sneeesa. *
Ever think what "success" in life
means to a man? That he work like
a dog as long as he lives and send his
wife abroad and his children away to
school. Then when he dies he must
leave a ; competence for > his "loved
ones," In order that they may con
tinue to live without work. Ever hear
of a man's loved ones being criticised
for failure to do their duty toward
him? But from the 1 time the boy is
eight years, old to the time the man
is tottering with old age he never picks
up a book, newspaper or magazine
without seeing something with refer
ence to his duty. But did you ever
hear of any one owing a duty to man
or boy?— Atchison Globe.

The female wasp spends the winter
in a torpid condition, and when spring
arrives she hunts up ' some sort of
sheltered spot appropriate for a nest.
Having selected the retreat, she pro

not serve her turn. The substance of

Fine China.
Fine china needs care In washing
and drying and should never be placed
In nervous or Indifferent hands. Treat
ed lovingly, china will last for, years
and . even generations. ' Only a piece
should be put In the tub at one time,
the soap should be made Into suds be
fore putting anything In, and the wa
ter must be very warm, not hot Fi
nally rinse In .water that's Just the
same— warm. A good supply of fine,
soft towels Is a necessity, and, thus
equipped, the washing of china is not
a hard task. China will shine beauti

there are excitable people who set out
to see everything, tire themselves out,
see only half of anything and are dis
satisfied in the end.

on a pillow and its body covered with
a white lace counterpane.
