CLARENCE MURPHY TRIAL
The Evidence Up to the Time of Going to Press-
Will Probably End Tomoi row
The trial ot Clarence Murpby,
charged with tbe murder of Mrs.
Phoebe A. Williams in Lancha Plana
on the night of June 11, was commen
ced in tbe superior court last Mon
day morning. The town was filled
with trial jurors and witnesses sub
poened en both sides. Probably
never in the history of the county has
so many witnesses appeared in a
criminal trial. Tbe number of wit
ness for the defense, from outside the
county, is in excess of one hundred.
Many of those, it is said, know
nothing whatever of the merits of the
case, but have been brought here
probably as witness on character.
The prosecution is represented by
district attorney Vicini alone: and
the defendent's case is conducted by
W. R. Jacobs, an attorney from
Stockton.
Defendant's wife, daughter of W.
Crail of Lancha Plana, was present in
the court room from tbe commence
ment of tbe trial; also a brother of
tbe defendant was inside the rail.
Altogether five or six brothers have
been brought here for the defense;
Tbe first day was consumed in tbe
effort to secure a jury of impartial
and unprejudiced men to try the
case. Tbe questions' propounded by
the attorney for the defense, touching
their qualifications as jurors, were
very searching. The outcome of
Monday's proceeding was the secur
ing of five jurors, who were sworn in
to try tbe case. ' This was the result
of the examination of only 12 tales
men, most of whom were excused for
cause, three premptoriiy.
On Tuesday tbe selection of the
jury was resumed, and at tbe adjourn
ment of court on that day four more
jurors had been secured, making
nine, with about sixty names in the
original venire left from which to
select the remaining jurors.
On Wednesday morning tbe work
of getting the jury was completed.
Between 40 and 50 talesman were
examined in tbe process of securing
tbe jury,' and most of those rejected
were peremptorily excused by one
side or tbe other. The jury sworn to
try the case is composed ot tbe
following named persons, S. J. Pearce,
W. S. Alford, Geo. Chisholm, Chas
H. Courrier, E. C. McCormick. Myron
S. Matson, T. Bloom, Geo C. Kefter,
John Rader, John Andrews, T. J.
Higbtower, G. C. Jennings. -
Mrs. Annie Yoak and LI W. Maker
were the first witnesses called. Their
testimony was to the effect that the
murdered woman, was Phoebe A.
Williams, their .mother. Deceased
was 76 years old, and had reise'ed in
Lancha Plana 45 years.
Alonzo Murpby, brother of the de
fendant, was called and testified
about a certain borse— a black stal
lion weighing about 700 lbs— which
animal is believed to have been
used by defendant and Swearingen in
driving to and from tbe Murpby
ranch on tbe night of tbe murder.
Witness testified that he resided at
Clements. Swearingen worked for
him, and left his employ on the*l''ri
day preceding the murder. Defend
ant and Swearingen left his ranch
together. They took the team to
Lockford. Defendant returned, but
Swearingen did not, as be stated he
was going to San Francisco to get his
head fixed, he being rather bard of
hearing. Witness drove the horse to
Clements on the night following tbe
murder, to get a doctor, as his wife
was sick; he remarked to tbe doctor
that tbe borse seemed sick. Witness
found two photographs in the manger
of his barn, and tbe next day be tele
phoned to sheriff Norman, but could
not get him; he then telephoned to

attorney had conversation in front
room ot couuty jail, district attor

Ledger Scholarship Awards.
After a very interesting and hotly
contested race, the voting contest tor
the two- free scholarships in the
Stockton Business College offered by
the Ledger, came to a close on Tues
day last at noon. ] The rivalry for the
honor of the first prize was intensifi
ed from the tact that the sum of §100
in cash— sufficient to pay all ex
penses during a six months 1 ' course,
was attached to the scholarship. The
two successful candidates are Miss
Mary Heath, and Lewis Love: each
wining a free course of six months in
the college and . the first named re
ceiving $100 for expenses. Both
candidates did valiant work for the
Ledger, as the number of votes' re
ceived by each sufficiently demon
strates. We are free to say that both'
have fully earned, "by hard and
effective work, the full price ot the
rewards. This office has been fully
repaid in the number of new sub
scribers added to the list, and' the
receipts from old'subscribers for any
outlay it has been put to on account
of this contest : and we hereby thank
all the contestants for the valuable
aid they have afforded .. us in bring
ing the Ledger subscription list' to a
paid-up standard. The last day of the
contest was exciting, both leading
candidates keeping back thousands of
votes to the last hour. Indeed more
votes were put in the last day than
all the votes counted prior thereto.
The score as finally made up is as
follows : -
Miss Mary Heath, Jackson 40,000 votes
Lewis Love, Jackson - 30,475 "
Jas Pengelly jr. Sutter Ck, 8,650 "
Francis Bryant, lone - 3,650 "
William Graynge, Volcano • 250 "
Elmer Dicken, Jackson - 250 " :
Total number of votes 83,225

BADARACCA MURDER CASE.
Allowed to Plead Guilty to Man
slaughter.
A. Caminetti, attorney tor Antone
Badaracca, who is confined in the
county jail of Alpine county, on a
charge of murder, in the killing of
John Pendola near Kirkwood, in
September last, returned from Maike
ville last Satuiday. He went there
to attend the arraignment of the de
fendant. He brought Dack word
that his offer to allow the defendant
to plead guilty to manslaughter was
accepted by the authorities of our
neighboring county. Thereupon
Badaraooa entered a plea of guilty of
manslaughter, and was sentenced to
10 years in the state prison. The
news oame as a great surprise to the
people of this county. Thi-j action
was explained that Alpine county is
poor, and a hotly contested trial such
as the Badaracoa case would likely
be, would cost a large sum— far more
than the county was able to stand.
Under the circumstances it was
thought best to accept the offer, and
avoid a costly trial. The defendant
and the victim were but sojourners in
Alpine at the time of the crime.
That county was called upon to foot
the expense of a prosecution that did
not arise from its own permanent
population. The feeling in Amador
is outspoken in disapproval of the
outcome. The crime, according to
all reports, was beyond the grade ot
manslaughter. Had he pleaded
guilty of higher degree and receiv
ed life imprisonment, little could
have been said against the result.
Badaraoca if he behaves himself, and
gets the full credits, will be free in
six years and eight months.
Caminetti says that it was not alone
the expense that led to the accept
ance of the offer. There was a doubt
as to the possibility of securing a
jury in the county. A chance of
venue to any other conuty meant a
heavy additional expense.
Badaracca asys that tiie fatal shot
was fired while Pendola and defend
ant were struggling for possession of
the pistol. On arriving at the barn
Badaracca wanted to know the reason
that Pendola had left the others.
Pendola after starting to unsaddle
the horse, saw the pistol sticking out
of Badarcca's pocket, and made a
grab for it. A struggle ensued, dur
ing which the weapon was discharged.
It is a Leuger pistol, and is very
easily discharged so defendant con
tended. Again Badaracca is subject
to %piliptio fits, and it would be
necessary to have a medical expert to
pass upon his mental condition, and
there is not a qualified practitioner
within the limits of Alpine county.
Badaracca was to be taken from Al
pine county to San Quentin some
time this week.

Incorporation.
Last Saturday a mooting of th£
committee representing the petition
betore the super visors requesting
the calling of an election to deter
mine the issue of the incorporation
of Jackson as a city, of the sixth
olass was held in tbe supervisors
room, to see if an agreement could
not.be reached amicably, without
throwing tbe responsibility of fixing
the boundaries upon the supervisors.
W. F. Detert was present. But no
agreement could be reached, as tbe
members of the committee held that
they had no authority to reduce the
bondaries by discarding the Zeila
mine or in any other way.
Tbe matter came up before the
supervisors last Monday, and was dis
cussed at some length. J. .W. Cald
well, selected by the committee to
present the matter to the boaid was
unwilling to take upon himself tbe
authority to call a mass meeting to
pass upon tbe boundary question.
The members of tbe board felt averse
to taking arbitrary action in 'the pre
mises. They wanted tbe people oi
Jackson to first tell them what . they

Mrs. Zappetteni Returns From Her
Race With Death.
Mrs. Marie Zappetteni, who raced
from Fruitvale to Amador county in
an automobile to be by the" bedside
ot her father as it was supposed in
his dying hour, is back at her home
again. Her father, who was stricken
with apoplexy, has now practically
recovered. When Mrs. Zappetteni
received the message announcing his
illness she found that to wait until
the following day fora train would
as she believed be too long to permit
her reaching Volcano in time to see
her father alive. She tried to hire an
automobile, but could not do so from
any of the regular automobile places,
as the trip was regarded as too
hazardous, J. V. Matteson, a real
estate dealer of this place, hearing of
the woman's desire, volunteered to
take her in his machine and notwith
standing a number of mishaps landed
her at her destination three hours
ahead of the time she would have
arrived.bad she traveled on the train.
Mrs. Zappetteni in speaking of her
experience d*eclares that it was a hor
rible one in that she was laboring
under the double strain of tast riding
and the dangers incident thereto and
the thought that she might arrive at
the bedside of her father too late to
gratify his desire to see her before
his death.— Oakland Enquirer.

and also next morning when he got

ingen, a good worker, quick strong,
at night he would work apparently
the same as he would in tbe morning,
a fast worker, first employed him on
first April, while he was there he
used Murphy's bay stallion and his
cart and harness, he used them after
the 11th of June: he left to take the
horso to a neighbor's for breeding
purposes. Kept his vehicles out iv
the open between the house and the
barn, his house stands higher than
the barn, about 4 or 5 or 6 feet pro
bably. Swearingen knew where he
kept hU bay stallion, on 9th ot June:
also where he kept his cart. Love had
hitched up stallion before: had seen
two persons ride in a cart: by pull
ing a board across prior to June 9.
lie never knew defendant to Own,
carry or use a pistol : defendant was
never arrested before : defendant was
born near Clemments.

ingen at their ranch. On Tuesday,
June 13: witness and Swearingen
worked ou well digging it out: saw
Young at tbe well, came out of the

Mr Uocke was at witnesses place be

Monday after June 9th for the first
time: never saw defendant p eparing
food to put in bucket to be lifted up

ing ot Monday, coming up tbe yard.
Ue first walked up and said hello and
asked if any officers had been there,
they said "no," he said has Jack
Kelly been there: he said the officers
were after him in Sacramento, he
walked up and had swam tbe river,
and then went back of picnic ground
to Murphys: he took his shoes off
went and bad supper, and acted as
though he was tired.
That night his wife, defendant's
wife, Henry Crail and bwearingen
and Duffy was there at time when he
came, and Swearingen stayed there
until be as arrested. First heard of
murder of Mrs Williams on Wednes
day, 14th, toward evening, defendant

spoke of. the murder at the ranch
iSweuiiugeu hung his head, looked up
under his eyes. After meals would
walk out of house: when the family
would speak of the murder he bud
nothing to say. Officers came to his
place, Sherilf Norman, Kelly and
Kainey, be had told tbe officers that
he was suspicions that Love wad con
nected with tbe murder, by his
actions, and that is the reason the
officers came. He did not hesitate
to tell officers all he knew, be assist
ed tbe officers all* be could, he did
not try to throw off suspicion in
regard to defendant. The kuife was
then shown to him, he recognized it,
and said be had seen Swearingen
sharpen it. He did not know whether
the little bay stallion had left tbe
barn or not.
Cross-examination : It was the only
time defendant had slept down in
tbe haysiack, and never had slept
there after that night. On the 13th
of July, went to Wallace, about ten
o'clock, and stayed until after dark :

close on to noon. When the officers
came he told them of tbe actions of
Love, and did not refuse to tell them
ail be knew, showed where Love took
bis shoes off: first told Henry .Poke
and Mr Kainey that be suspected
Swearingen, a couple of days before
hia arrest : never suspected l''red
Miner ot tbe crime, but said he heard
he was suspected; did not say to JUr
Kaiuey that if they hunted the house
of Norman Stidsou, tbny would find
the watch: took .Matt Duffy because
he had bis hand broke, and could not
drive.
Mrs Murphy wife of defendant

she saw Sunday evening in her sister
in-law's bedroom, un a shelf: took

never asked her to wash any knife,
she milked . one cow night of 11th.-
Walter Murphy was expected to

were gone quite awhile, after they
finished with the milk seperutor,

bedroom talking, sat in defendant'^
lap: it was 12 o'clock, and " she told
them it was time to go to bed. . lie
asked her if she had lifted tbe bed
out, she said she hadn't: weather was
warm and they were troubled with
fleas, defendant wanted her to go out
and sleep in haystack, but sbe would
not go; so he aud Henry Crail slept
out tbere. He came back nfter be
went down to get some crackeis:

not notice anything- unusual, be was
also at borne the Saturday- uigbt
before, slept in bouse with her, and
her little brother was sleeping with
them. Saw Swearingen Monday night
coming up tbe bill, south. ."
Sbe did not prepare any food for
her husband and did not see her bus
band preparing any meal or lunch;
never beard ot any meals being passed,
up to barn by means of leius. When
Swearingen ate supper- she had pre
pared for him, bo seemod very tired
and sat at tbe table barefooted.
Mrs Alonzo Murphy was then
swoin: was born near Lodi: was May
Carter, before marriage. She got up
from bed on Monday, ten days after
confinment, saw defendant aud
brother pass the door on June 11 th,
they returned about half past ton;
she and little Homy Crail came into
the house very much frightened, and
defendant's wife took pistol down
from shelf, and said she would dare
anyone to come in to the house, wit
ness said there were no shells and
barrel was busted, but she would run
a bluff anyway, aud defendant's wife
laid pistol in bureau: saw it in same
place next morning. Swearingen had
two grips at their house, one a brown
oner He left the house on Friday.
When he came back 'he stayed and
worked for her husband. Her atten
tion was called to the pistol, and she
said it was hers, that Earnest Murphy
gave it to, her shortly after she was
married. ' The officers came to her
home atfer June 11 and took a state
ment from her, a shorthand reporter
took it down. Officers Norman,
Sibley and Kainey were there. Mr
Norman came to the house after tbe
pistol, Mrs Annie Murphy went to get
it for him, Norman followed her into
the house, and witness told Norman
and Vicini sbe did not think it had
been used because the barrel was
broken and it was dirty; did not
know about telling the district attor
ney on July 7th that defendant went
to bed at half -past eleven; think
her husband had his supper and was
about ready to feed hia horses when
Swearingen arrived at their bouse
Monday evening.
J. L). Farkut* stated that defendant
and brother gave him tbe pictures,
which he identified, also some letters
and an ordinary diary book, letters
were in book. He handed them over
to constable Kelly, looked through
tbe book but did not find any -plan
of Western hotel in it, Mr Kelly look
ed through it with him. The book
was shown him, but he could not re
collect about the plan.
Mrs Murphy recalled said she saw
Annie Murphy give tbe pocket bouk
to her husband; sbe never took the
diagram of Western hotel : had seen
book before, Love bad shown them
letters in it. - . .
Mrs Annie Murphy recalled, bad
never taken a diagram from tbe book
that was found, could not tell bow
many times sbe had seen the book,
Swearingen always kept it iv is
pocket.
Henry Mnrphy, brother of Annie
Murphy, remembered the Sunday
when Alonzi) and defendant went
way. He slept with Clarence at
baystack that night. Woke up dur
ing night, as some horses were trying
to get to hay. Clarence was there
when he woke up. bad seen the boys
go out witb spring wagon aud ttow { o
horses Sunday afternoon. Saw dis
trict attorney at lone and talked with
him in Crabtree's stable in presence
of sheriff Norman, since that time
had been down at Murphy's ranch.
Hemembers tolling him he slept
with defendant in bay stack on Sun
day night, he said be went to bed at
12 o'clock : said be did not tell dis
trict attorney that be had to pull
and tug at defendant to wake him up,
and he got up and helped him mil lc.
Said he heard horses walking, and
they woke him up. Had talked to
Mr Jacobs several times. Murphy's
folKs never spoke to him of the case:
never drove tbe cows that Monday
morning. Mr Jacobs wont over the
cate several times with him. Mr
Jacobs told all his (witness') folks
not to speak of the caso in Henry's
pieserice.

Wednesday afternoon after the recess
of court. Said he was 24 years old,
born in San Joaquin county. Lived
moat of bis life in San Joaquin
county, was three yearsin Calaveras
county: knew Swearongen: remembei
ed night of June S). On that day
went to Lockford witb Harry -Love,
took a mare aud colt with him: colt
had a lump on ankle, aud took him
to horse doctor, who would not per
form an operation as animal wa3 too
young. Swearingen took small
satchel with him, put it in wagon.
Knew Mrs Williams also Chosler
Maker: never counted money tor
Mrs Williams: never told any person
that he had done so. Had no con
versation with Love at Clements
picnic in regard to i robbing Mra
Williams the day before picnic. Did
not know or say to him that
she had eight or ten thousand doll
ars. Never mentiuned such a matter
to him on way to Lockford. Did not
say anything to any person in regard
to robbing any one. While gping
from ranch to Lockford never hand?
Ed Love a diagram ot . Western hotel
in Sacramento* never made a diagram
of Western hotel : never told him to
go to Western hotel so he would be
recognized, aud did not say he would
send a man to hotel' on Saturday' and
Sunday uigbt so that he couid prove
an alibi. When he left . Murphy's
place 9th June thought be was going
to San Francisco to have an operation
perfoimed b"h his head. " iNever saw
him Saturday night after* he went
away : did not go to baystack to meet
him; did not go tbare about 11
o'clock: did not; taue him any
thing to eat: did not tell him to go
to hollow until he came; did not
take him to Laucba l'luiui, nor agree
to meet him there Sunday night; did
not give him any onious or bread,
nor take him to culvert in a cart.
Witness was not there tuui. night, and
never told him to stay in woods till
defendant came: did not tell him to
stay there uutil 11 o'clock and if he
did not come to come back: did not
go iv hoise and cart Sunday niglit to
Foster's bridge to nioet Sweariugen.
Diduot drive ou any such trip: never
told Love to stay out iv yard while
be took Chester Maker out, and while
be robbed the houso. The pistol was
shown him: be said he never gave
same to Swearingen that night: was
not at Williams' home with Swear
ingen, and -never assisted Love in
murdering Mrs Williams and Chester
Maker. The witness' testimony in
chief was in fact a clear cut denial of
all the statements made by Love
connecting turn in any way with the
tragedies enacted in Laucha Plana on
that fatal Sunday night.
The cross-exauiiuation was rigor
ous. It brought out that defendant
did not know the exuet time he went
to bed on June 11, at the haystack;
it was a lneie estimate; never slept
tbere before; but slept outside every
harvest soason'since ne could remem
ber; shook his clothes to snake fleas
off. iSrother Alonzo was first person
he saw next morning; got up about i
o'clock. -On Monday Sweariugen
called defendant and asked if officers
had been there: said thoy were after
him in San Francisco aud Sacramento :
that be came across countiy to Mur
phy ranch. The pictures were re
cognized by witness, aud the spot in
the barn where. they were found was
pointed out : gave constable Parker
pictures at Wallace never, took them
from Williams' place: was arrested at
Mrs Hill's place July 5 by sheriff
Norman and deputy Kay: never
arrested before; did say to officer
that there was no pistol on : Murphy
ranch: that he never owned one: his
counsel did not want him to talk:
said he did not want to meet Swear
ingen but would like to aiuet him
outside : found tbe photos on June 25,
Alonzo found one the day before: his
wife had a dream that money was
buried by tbe well, aud Monday he
went to search : looking around barn
found a pnoto: kept looking and
found another, with bis brother took
tiiem to house, and showed them to
Alonzo's wile: she did not know
them: showed, them to defendant's
wife, she recognizod them as tnose of
Carrie Williams. He batched in
Luncha Plaua quite a wbile, about
100 yards from Mrs Williams' house:
went to her house twice: very friendly
witb Chester Maker: .never stole
chickens, but shot to scare those who
were going to steal, was about 30 feet
from chicken houso: told Kelly to
search Love and he would find the
knife: Love said if officers asked for
him to whistle to him as if whistl
ing for a dog. Witness would not
swear that he had never rented room
22 iv Western notel, Sacramento
prior to murder, he never handed
papers to Love or Swearingen with
diagram of hotel. Tbis closed case
for defence.
In rebuttal sheriff Norman again
took the stand. Said Chester Maker's
body had on a black shirt, with small
white stripes in it: made a search of
the Williams' home," did not find
auy nightgown: there was a shotgun
in corner, and books on table, shoes
under the bed : at Crabtree's stable
heard Henry Crail. say ho slept in
haystack witb Clarence .Murphy : that
he did not wake" during the uignt,
and iv morning could not wake de
fendant up: that he got up himself
and drove cows in. While in vicinity
of Murphy ; ranch, Alonzo Murphy
followed officer around. Alonzo said
qe did not know where Clarence
slept on June 11, that on June 12 bo
couid not get the horse out of a
walk in driving to Clo r> :ents.
L. W. Maker made a thorough
search of Williams' house after the
funeral with sheriff Norman and con
stablo Kelly. The room had been
cleaned out to make a neat appear
ance.

Pro. Meyer's Conclusions.
Prof. H. R. Meyer of the University
ot Chicago reaches these conclusions
in his book on "Government Kegala
tion of Kailroad Rates:" "The ver
dict of the experience of the countries
of continental Europe and of Austra
lia, as well as the verdict of the ex
perience of the United State?, under
both the Federal interstate commerce
commissions and the several State
commissions, is unmistakable. It is
impossible for the state to conserve
and promote the public welfare ny
intervening in the regulation of rail
way rates, beyond the point of seek
ing to abolish soeret personal dis
criminations, guaranteeing 'that all
rates shall be reasonable pre se, and
providing that those rates which in
volve the question of relative reason
ableness shall embody compromises
which were made with intelligence
and in good faith."

Every Ounce Yon Eat
Every ounce of food you eat that
fails to digest does a pound of barm.
It turns tbe entire meal into poison.
This not only deprives the blood of
the necessary tissue building material
but it poisons it. Kodol Dyspepsia
Cure is a perfect digestant. It digests
the food regardless of the condition
of the stomach. It allows that organ
to rest and get strong again. Ke
lieves belching, beart burn, sour
stomach, indigestion, palpitation of
the heart, etc. Bold by City Phar
macy.

A NIGHTHARE
Gives point to tho fact that excessive or
irregular eating disturbs the digestion.
Nightmare or r.I/ht hag has its day time
correspondence in the undue fullness
after eating, with tho belehings and sour
or bitter rising so often experienced after
too hasty or too hearty eating.
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery
cures dyspepsia or bad stomach. When
the weak stomach is strengthened and
invigorated the whole body shares in the
increased strength derived from food
properly digested and perfectly assimi-
lated.
"I was a victim of sleeplessness and ex-
treme nervousness Induced by chronic lncll-
eestion and I felt heavy, tired and worn out
continually," writes Miss Mary Smith, of 1013
No. Wahsatch Street. Colorado Sprines. Colo.
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery was
tho only medicine which relieved me. With-
in a week after I began using It that heavy
oppressed feeling after meals had left me,
ajnd I found that I was able to sleep better
than for months previously. My appetite
was gradually restored, general system was
toned up, nervousness became a thing of the
past and I have now been In splendid health
for over nine months."
Sometimes a selfish dealer tempted by
the little more profit paid on the- sale of
less meritorious medicines will offer the
customer a substitute as being "just as
good" as the "Discovery." It may be
better for him because it pays better, but
It is not as good for you, if you want the
medicine tliat has cured others, and
which you believe will euro you.

A Voice of Approval.
Tbe following letter from a sub
scriber is a fair sample of what tbe
Ledger is receiving in approval of
the course of this journal on county
matters. It is also . pleasing to
know that the magazine section just
added is appreciated.
Oleta, Amador Co., Cal.
Editor Ledger — 1 have received the
first number ot your magazine sec
tion. It is certainly a great addition
to your reading matter, and very in
teresting.
You have published tbe tax rate
of a few counties higher than Amador.
Let us have some that are lower, at
your convenience. Our taxes are too
high by one-half, and if we send any
more legislators of the same kind,
they will be higher still.
We can but thank you tor watching
over the finances of the county, and
the interest of the taxpayers.
I am your respectfully.

HOW UNCLE SAM
PAYS HIS DEBTS
By IIOX. ELLIS If. ROBERS
(Formerly Treasurer of th? United States)
Why should' Undo Sam, rich as he
is, be in debt at all?
It cost a largo sum to set up for
hitnselt, oven it he did fail to pay
some of the continental currency
issued to carry on the Revolution.
tie had to defend the frontiers from
Indians, and to protect sailors' rights
on hifih seas by the war of 1812. To
keep ii is states together strained his
muscles and his iesources, and the
Civil Wai closed with a debt on his
shoulders monstrous in its magnitude,
and with a buiden of pensions to be
measured by the beneUcence of the
triumph. :.-':•;..
iiesides, he bought land, a vast em
pire from France, some irom Mexico
besides spoils of war, Alaska from
Kussia, and Florida, Porto Rico and
the Philippines from Spain. Nor
was Hawaii annexed without expense.
He lost money by depositing funds
with the states. He recovered with
interest the credits he advanced to
the Pacific railioads, and now hu is
on the Central American isthmus,
starting in ias a canal-builder on a
grand scale. The years have been
few in which he has let his outlay
run ahead of his income, and these,
with rare exceptions, were during
war times. • ■".
When he first started business for
himself under the Constitution, in
1789, Uncle Sam assumed a debt ot
§71,<X)0,508 for the cost of the Revo
lution, and he had not a cent in the
treasury. Necessity compelled him
to borrow at once for current use,
so that he owed in 1791 §75,463,477.
This burden was reduced t0515,209,738
in 1812, before the second war with
Oreat Britain. Hy 1816 it had been
carried' up to 8217,334,934. This
whole debt was wiped out by 1836,
when it stood at the nominal figures
of 837,513. There was gradual in
crease to 832,742,922 in 1843.
WHAT THE WARS COST.
The war with Mexico soon came,
and the figures with fluctuations ran
as high as 568,304,79t> in 1851. Our
maximum net indebtedness was lifted
by the Civil War to 82,756,431,571 iD
August, 1H65.
Theu reductions were made year by
year with occasional variations, so
that the amount, less cash in treasury,
was 51,175,168,675 in 1887, and 8838,
969,475.75 in 1893. A period of ad
dition followed, and betore the war
with Spain, in April, 1898, the figures
became 81,018,432,652. For that war
a loan ot 8200,000,000 was iesued,
which raised the debt, June 30, 1899,
to 81,155,320,235. By payments this
soon began to grow less, and June 30,
190b, it was 8909,147,625.
These formidable figures prove
that Uncle Sam does actually. pay his
deJbls. He had practically settled in
full all nis accounts up to 1836. By
1891 ho had canceled a billion and
three-quarters of the gigantic expend
itures for the Civil War. The echoes
of the guns at Santiago and Manila
had not ceased betore he began to
buy his own bonds in advance of
maturity. He is ready to pay tor the
Panama Canal and ihe equities to
Columbia out of his savings, and to
go on with the great work of connect
ing the two oceans nefoie he borrows
an additional dollar.
Great Britain has at different
periods made temporary reductions
in its indebtedness, only to add again
to the magnitude. France heroically
canceled its war indemnity to Ger
many- Yet no one of the govern
ments of the Old World expects ever
to balance its books free from debt.
The financial obligations ot every one
of them are planned to be perpetual.
This must be so, because the debt of
European countries bear so large a
ratio to their wealth and populations.
For each of its inhabitants France
in 1903 carried a debt of 5151.60,
Spain of 8108.84; the United King
dom of 896.29; Russia in Europe,
831.35; Austria-Hungary, 824.32; Ger
many, because France paid the cost
of the war of 1870, 810.51. Of British
colonies, Australia owes 8250 for each
person, and Canada 850. By contrast
the United States is indebted only
511.38 for each person.
Measured by the estimated woith
of its property, the debt of France
was 11.9 per cent, of its wealth; of
Gormany, 7.73 per cent. ; Russia, 10.4
per cent. ; of the United Kingdom,
6.25; of Australia, 4.18 per cent., and
of Canada, 5.09 per cent. ; but the
ratio of tbe debt of the United States
to its wealth is only ninety-seven one
hundredths ot one per cent.
If Uncle Sam were to draw on the
savings-banks, their deposits in the
single state of New l'ork,. or 44 per
cent, of their deposits in the country
as a whole, would pay all ho owes,
and 36 per cent, of the deposits of
tbe national banks would perform tbe
same task. It would take only 29per
cent, of the value of farms to offset
all his bonds.
The exports of agricultural pro
ducts for a single year are enough to
cancol all his obligations. The public
lands which belong to him, unappro
priated and outside of the reserv
ations, not including the Philippines,
would, if sold at 81.03 an acre, pay
every dollar of his Indebtedness.
Thus tbe burden of Uncle Sam's
debt is light by every comparsion.
Ho collected revenues in 1866 amount
ing to 815.73 to each person ot the
population. If he should collect in
the samn ratio now, he could cancel
all bis bonds in sixteen months, be
sides meeting all expenses, and so
wipe his slate clean. \.*V

A PRESIDENT'S CABINET.
SOME SECRETARIES HATE AT*
TAINED GREATER FAME THAN
THEIR CHIEF.
While Appointments Are Political,
the Cabinet is Usually the Presi
dent's Closest Adviser.
James S. Henry,
According to the old saw "It takes
nine tailors to make a man," so in the
Government of. the United States it
takes nine Cabinet officers to make
an administration. Primarily Ameri
can cabinet officers are selected to be
come the heads of the nine great ex
ecutive departments of the Govern
ment. As one star differeth from an
other star in glory so one cabinet offi
cer differs from another in opportun
ity, ability and the power to make a
lasting impression upon the history of
the country. These nine heads of de
partments are chosen by the Presi
dent and although the approval of the
Senate of the United States is required
to make their appointment legal and
constitutional, the preference* of the
Executive is invariably respected and
the nine Cabinet officers represent his
personal choice, so far as politics
leaves him a free agent.
To be a member of the President's
Cabinet has filled the ambition of many
statesmen. It is a place only one re
move from that to which all native
born citizens of the United States have
a right to aspire — the Presidency it
self. If there Jiaye been disappoint
ments and unrealized ambitions on the
part of the great men who have been
President the world has not heard of
them. The disappointments, the dis
couragements, the disillusionment, the
restrictions that have been experienced
by statesmen who had hoped to
achieve glory and fame as Cabinet offi
cers can be read in the national rec
ords from the foundation of the Gov
ernment to the present time. Fail
ure to accomplish great plans and to
realize hopes of a lasting place in his
tory has sent many Cabinet officers

embittered and disappointed back into
private life. ■".;■ .-
May Not be Personal Friends.
While the President of the United
States is entitled to choose the nine
gentlemen who shall sit about his
council table as his Cabinet advisors,
the political system in effect in the
United States often robs this selection
of its personal character. A newly
elected President may know of nine
men in his circle of business, social and
political acquaintances whom he would
like to have around him as counsellors
and whom he believes would make ef
ficient heads of departments in the
administration' of Government laws
and business. The exigencies of poli
tics, however, usually compel him to
choose his Cabinet officers from differ
ent sections of the country and in ac
knowledgement of certain potent influ
ences, sometimes commercial, some
times economic, sometimes religious,
and often purely political that helped
make his election sure. The Chief
Executive before deciding upon the
composition of his Cabinet inquires
carefully into the qualifications, ability
and character of the men whom he will
invite to sit at his council table, but
it often happens that the first time he
has come in personal contact with his
future . advisor is when he meets him
to extend the invitation to him to en
ter the Cabinet.
In the economy of Government and
in the social life at the nation's Cap
ital, an American Cabinet officer oc
cupies a commanding position, but in
the accomplishment of great deeds of
statesmanship and as a power in fash
ioning the policies of the nation, the
Cabinet minister's own personality, his
ability and genius can alone make
success. There are conspicuous ex
amples in the history of the United
States where Cabinet ministers hava
dominated the Executive and carved
their names higher on the pillar of
fame than the Presidents with whom
they served. The impress made on
national affairs by such men as Daniel
Webster, John C. Calhoun and James
G. Blame, as ministers of state, if
greater than that of many Presidents
of the United States. It is not neces
rary to refer to musty history for ex
amples of Cabinet ministers who have
yon international fame. The late John
II?.y, Secretary of State under Presi
The Amador Ledger.
dent McKinley and President Roose
velt, seems yet a living actual per
sonality in the affairs of the world. If
no other monument had been establish
ed by his long public service, the "open
door" policy for which he obtained rec
ognition in the Far East would mark
his statesmanship for all time. With
his colleague, Elihu Root, who is now
his successor, he shared the glory of
the late President McKinley's admin
istration in which both men were su
perlative influences.
■ ;'• Sherman's Earlier Fame.
Going back a little further we find
the late John . Sherman standing as
the monument of sound finance and
marking the otherwise colorless Hayes
administration from 1877 to 1881 as an
epoch in the financial history of the
country. In the days of the Civil War,
Stanton, at the head of the War De
partment, earned the name of being
the greatest Secretary of War the
United States ever had and was the
mainstay of the immortal Lincoln in
the latter's heartbreaking experiences
with, traitors, politicians and self-seek
ing army officers. The 130 years of
nationaMife of the United States fur
nished many brilliant examples of
what a Cabinet officer can accomplish
and the influential part he can play in
the achievements of an administration.
It depends largely upon the Presi
dent of the United States to what ex
tent a Cabinet officer may achieve
prominence in national affairs. Dur
ing the last generation most of the
Presidents of the United States have
been men of iron will and command
ing personality. Most of them, how
ever, have depended upon, members of
their Cabinet for expert' advlcs on
great national and international issues.
In the administration of Grant, Cleve
land, Harrison, McKinley and Roose
velt certain of their ministers were
pre-eminent in the direction of affairs
of state and domestic policies. These
Presidents were and are strong men,
but ever ready to listen to the advice
and appreciate the statemanship of the
strong men V" b y had chosen for their
Different T < catment of Cabinets.
Each President has had his own
conception of the functions of a Cab
met o nicer. Each one has adopted
his own method of Cabinet consulta
tion. President Roosevelt might be
said to have a Cabinet of specialists.
He has selected men whom he believed
peculiarly fitted to administer the af
fairs of the different departments. At
the bi-weekly Cabinet meetings, which
are held when the President is in his
executive office in Washington, each
Cabinet officer presents a short re
sume of the condition of his depart
ment. If there is any matter that has
arisen, under his jurisdiction that is of
a widespread, general character it is
reserved for discussion by himself and
the President, and perhaps one or two
other members of the Cabinet who re
main after the formal meeting. Great
questions of national and international
policy are not matters of general dis
cussion in Mr. Roosevelt's Cabinet.
They are taken up and debated by the
President and those Cabinet officers
whom he believes are specially quali
fied to give expert opinion upon them.
The late President McKinley had an
entirely different method and ■ the
meetings of his Cabinet were actual
state councils. Every matter affecting
the nation at large or bearing upon our
international relations was brought up
at these meetings and each one of the
President's advisors was requested to
submit his opinion. The Secretary of
Agriculture was asked for his views
on the advance on Pekin, while .the
opinion of the Secretary of State on
the type of battleships to be adopted
by the Navy was welcomed. Mr. Mc-
Kinley believed in this way that he se
cured the best results and it also gave
his cabinet officers an opportunity to
exhibit whatever of talent or genius
of statesmanship they possessed.
To Remove a Tight Ring.
A very simple way of removing a
very tight ring from the finger is to
take a piece, of small cord or wrapping
thread and push one end of it under
the ring. Then, taking hold of the
other end of the string, begin winding
around the finger from close up against
the ring to the very tip of the finger.
Then, to remove the ring, take hold
of the end of the cord that was slipped
under the ring and unwind the cord.
As the unwinding progresses the ring
will be carried along with it and re
moved without difficulty.

session of Congress introduced a bill
providing for government supervision.
It was passed by the Senate, but
when it came up for consideration
at the hands of the Representatives,
Delegate Rodey of New Mexico,
smarting under the sting left by the
failure of his statehood plans, charged
that the provision in this bill which
planned to locate a leper colony on
some abandoned military reservation
was, in fact, a . plan to foist the
"unclean" upon New Mexico, as there
are several abandoned reservations in
that territory. - .
The bill failed to pass the House.
It is believed that Senator Crane pro
poses to again introduce this bill ear
ly in the next session. It will be in
troduced in a somewhat different man
ner from the old one. It will provide
for a "Lepers Home" instead of
"Leprosarium", as this latter term
conveyed the impression that the dis
ease was more prevalent in the Unit
ed States than it really is.
To Search For Cure.
Leprosy was regarded by the Israel
ites as incurable. In fact the records
of ancient times show the great fear
in which it has always been held.
Medical science has learned little or
nothing regarding leprosy. One of
the strongest arguments for the care
of the "unclean" is, that such an insti
tution would make possible a careful
study of the disease and, perhaps, in
time result in the discovery of a
cure. There is a government institu
tion for the care of lepers in Hawaii,
LEPER AT WALLS OF JERUSALEM.
at Molokai, where often a leper is sep
arated from his family by forcible
means. Fathers and mothers are tak
en from their children, a child from
its parents, a friend from friend — and
all this at a time when the afflicted
is to all intents and purposes perfect
ly well. iGovernment officials state,
however, that is not the idea in the
establishment of this new institution
under the Crane bill, to take any leper
from his family by forcible means.
The plan will be merely to isolate all
cases.

One morning last spring there ap
peared in the London papers graphic
descriptions of the arrival' at South
amptou of the "Cullinan," the 3,032
carat (25 oz.) diamond found j in ;-the
Premier mine, Johannesburg, in> Jan
uary. —Details of the appearance of
the two agents from South Africa, the
black .bag carried by the older i and
said to contain the biggest diamond in
the world, the crowd at the docks, the
detectives sent from Scotland Yard,
filled a column. As a matter of fact,
the Cullinan made the trip from
Johannesburg to London in an ordln
This necklace took the highest award at the Saint Louis Exposition.
Its value is $230,000. It contains French Crown Diamonds presented
by Naiolean to Josephine on their divorce, and, which later passed
through many hands, including the notorious Mme. Humbert. It ha*
always brought disaster to the possessor. It also contains two big
stones which served as cuff buttons for " Boss " Tweed of New York ;
three diamonds from Lady Hope's (May Yohe) collection ; Alvinjoshn
gems and Maximillian diamonds. Exhibited by Maurice Bower of

aty, inconspicuous package through
the registered mail, postage two shill
ings. It is not impossible that the
Southampton romance was conceived
and paid for at advertising rates by
the owners or underwriters to divert
attention, for the diamond was valued
at four million and insured for two
and a half million dollars.
Two more large diamonds have since
been found in the same mine, one
weighing 334 carats and the other 460
carats. One wonders who can afford
to buy these stones. It will cost enor
mously to put them on the market.
Most diamonds are sold outright by
the miner to the cutter, and one of the
biggest South African diamond kings
has said that the margin of profit up
on which the entire diamond industry
is carried on ic but little larger than
the percentage ' of gain in any other
line of business.
The jewellers of Paris claim that in
proportion as the value of the dia
monds in a necklace decreases, so does
the cost of setting increase. A dia
mond necklace that sells for $14,000
has cost the jeweller $000 in mount
ing, while one that sells for $200,000
will require an expenditure of only
ifHOO in the mounting 1 . From, the
$109,700 remaining in the latter case,
still further deduction must be made
for the expense of preparing the
stones. The figures obtained on a
.$200,000 necklace in a Paris shop indi
cated that the diamonds composing it
were valued at much less than $89,000 j
when rough. The woman who buys
such an ornament contributes more to 1
the actual prosperity of the working
class than many of the so-called
social reformers who rave at her ex
travagance.
How Diamonds are Cut.
So far. Europe has been the center
of the diamond-cutting industry. In
Amsterdam there are more than 15.000
cutters, in Antwerp 3,000, in the Jura
Mountain district GOO, in Paris 200
and in London only 150. They are
divided into three classes, cleavers,
shapers and polishers. The cleaver
examines the rough diamond, and if
he finds a Haw cuts i. into as many ,
perfect gems as the grain of the car
bon will permit. For this purpose tiie
rough stone is set in r. mold to which
it is securely attached with aluminum,
and then applied to the cutting tool—
a circular saw about 5 inches in diam
eter, made of soft copper, with a mix
ture of oil and diamond dust rubbed
into the edge. The saw rotates at a
tremendous speed, being turned by a
leather belt running from an engine.
An expert cleaver, if paid so much per
diamond cut could make from $00 to
$SO, and .as one cleaver furnishes
work for 50 or CO shapers, would
quickly work himself out of a job.
Consequently, he prefers to go slowly
and receive a monthly wage of $120.
The shapers' or . "bruteurs". outline
the form in /which the , diamond will
ultimately appear. In this operation,
the "bruteur" takes two stones of sim
ilar size and hardness, fits each into
a metal ■ cap, sets one in a machine
that resembles a carpenter's lathe, and
as it revolves the second stone is
pressed against it The dust caused
by tfie friction is caught In a tiny box.
Uofore the invention tlf •this machine,
the "bruteur" held the diamonds . be
tween the thumb and forefinger, of
each hand and rested the little fingers
on the sides of the tank, which is
made of brass. In ; time the constant
pressure on the brass wore the sides
of the box intq grooves* while the
'continued effort of rubbing the dia
monds against each other brought on
a nervous jerking of the forearms,
and the strained attitude of the head,
always bent forward to watch the
shaping of the gems, caused great
swellings at the back of the neck.
Usually the "bruteur" spends three
days on the shaping of a stone and
makes from $2.40 to $3.00 a day. ;
The -polisher who makes the facets,
uses a machine which carries a metal
disc placed horizontally and revolving
at the rate of 2.500 revolutions per
minute. The disc is of steel with a
preparation of diamond dust and puri
fied olive oil rubbed into the surface.

Three Hundred Diamonds In Necklace
In the $200,000 necklace mentioned
there were 300 diamonds. Allowing
three days' brutage (rough shaping),
and three months' polishing on-each,
the sum expended for these two items
alone amounts to $110,700.
After the stones arrived at the jew
eller's, they, had, of course, to/ be
mounted. To this end the big shops
of Paris employ a staff of designers,
goldsmiths, silversmiths, setters and
polishers. Usually, the designers are
men who have come into the shop in a
less important' capacity, shown talent,
been sent by the firm to an art school
and put through a course of instruc
tion. According to his ability, a de
signer earns from $G0 to $100 a month.
He may work for months without pro
ducing a single sketch that goes to the
studios, then in a week he will turn
out two or three that meet the diffi
cult taste of the employers Designs
are done -in water colors. ■'
In Paris., the real jeweller is not the
owner of the shop, but the craftsman
who fashions the gold or platinum In
to the skeleton that holds the precious
stones. ' .In America he is called a
gold or silversmith. Each separate
clasp or gem-holder, goes first to the
polisher. Then to a jeweller who
assembles, or joins together, the entire
frame for the . necklace, tiara, -or
whatever ■the' design may call for, and
again to the polisher.
The setter, as his name indicates,
fastens or sets the diamonds.. into the
framework, and sends it on a last visit
to the j _ .
Polishers are Women.
The polishers are usually women.
As a rule they work in groups of five
or six under a patroness, who keeps
a little apartment in a narrow street
of Montmartre, Gaillon, Mail, or some
other cheap and crowded quarter of
Paris. With good luck the patroness
makes from $1,000 to ?1,200 a year.
The polishers are taken as apprentices
at 14 years of, age. At 16 they may
get forty to sixty cents a day, and at
18 a dollar to a dollar twenty.
The labor of all these craftsmen on
the necklace in mind amounted to
about $300, which added to $110,700
for preparing the diamonds, aW
deducted from the selling price of
$200,000 left only $89,000 to'cover cost
of rough stones, incidental expense of
handling, etc., could not have left
any phenomenal profit for the mine
owner who dug and delivered them to
the cutter. Such a necklace is said to
furnish work enough to support 400
families for a year. .Of course, this
does not take into consideration the
workers in the mines, nor the heavy
staff of clerks and officials necessary
to carry on the big diamond producing
fields. The business of finishing .the
raw diamond for the final purchaser
offers the best paid labor to be found
in Europe. Owing to the duty on cut
gems brought into this country, Amer
ican dealers are building up a similar
industry in the United States, and it
is rational to suppose that the crafts
men employed in this country will
receive even still higher wages than
those paid abroad.

city in the largest Congressional dis

To the Easterner who first visits this

ity which its citizens know so well
how to extend, the question is upper
most, what makes a city here? After
journeying more than 500 miles across
-Western Kansas and the Panhandle of

it is all one vast cattle range, down
into the adobe hills and sage brush
wastes of eastern New Mexico, there
is a reason for asking thi3 question.

-tions long held and regretfully let go

border is the land of manama, of to

not yet come. Well, wake up! Life
is just as ieal, just as earnest and as
strenuous in El Paso as in New York
or Chicago, and when you rub up in
business against the El Pasoan you
need all your shrewdness and business
acumen.
The Old and The New.
El Paso is old— very " old, and El
Paso is new, too — very new. This de
lightful paradox is full of surprises
and charms. Right up against the old
Spanish dwelling of adobe with long,
low windows, heavily barred, and ita
patio in the -center, you are likely to
find a modern office building with ele
vators and electric lights.
Something of a feeling of living in
the past comes, over you when you en

— churches erected more than 300 years
ago. The solemn silence of these
shadowy halls has been broken by the
orisons of countless thousands and

Dam. .
Saxon /had looked upon Plymouth
Rock.
In the first half of the Sixteenth
Century the Spanish. Conquistadores
seeking new fields of conquest for the
glory of Spain, swept up .the Bio
Grande Valley. They found pastoral
settlements of Pueblo Indians prac
ticing agriculture through the aid of
irrigation, carrying the precious waters
of the Rio Grande out upon the desert
and reaping harvests from fields which
bad been in cultivation beyond the
traditions of the oldest members of the
tribe. Spanish settlements followed
the conquerers. With the ready adap
tability of the early explorers they
utilized the old irrigation systems.
Thresh by Trampling of Goats.
The unprogressiveness of the Span
iard is no where more strikingly re
vealed than in the Rio Grande Val
-ley, where the descendents of the early
Spaaiah explorers are to-day engaged
in> apiculture in just the same man
net ag their forefathers practiced it,
and iadeed with methods strangely like
those im the days of Abraham. You
can see them reap with the sickle and
thresh by the trampling of goats.
Progressive Americans settling in the
upper reaches of the Rio Grande in
later years, showed small regard for
the settlers ia tho lower valley. Soon
their long lines of broad canals began
to make sad inroads in the water sup
ply which was needed for the old
canals. Mexico, Texas and New Mex
ico were arrayed against Colorado
which, robbed them of their priceless
heritage and threatened .to transform
thousands of' acres of fruitage and
bloom into its original state — that of
the desert. As the water grew scarce
there sprang up hostilities between the
citizens of the whole Rio- Grande Val
ley. Neighbor began to be arrayed
against neighbor; there were even fam
ily rows over the water. For years
these conditions prevailed. Mexico
made respectful protest against the use
of the waters of the Rio Grande in
Colorado which deprived the ancient
canals of the Republic of their rights
long established. The Comity of Na
tions was threatened, "i;
To Build a Huge Dam.
It was the passage of the National
irrigation act which wrought a- won
drous change in the conditions and
knit together in one brotherhood all the
citizens of the lower valley, imbuing
them with a spirit of co-operation and
enthusiasm. The Reclamation Service
took hold of the project and worked
out a plan to store the vast Rio Grande
floods which were- annually a source
of much loss to the valley and which
were wholly unutilized. This plan the
people have accepted as a salvation.
One hundred miles above El Paso the
Rio Grande flows through, a deep nar
row canyon. A dam 255 feet high
across its lower end will create the
largest artificial reservoir in this coun
try. It will make a lake 40 miles long,'
1% miles wide and from 100 to 175
feet deep. It will contain water enough
to cover 2,000,000 acres a foot deep.
Into this "" vast reservoir the greatest
flood the Rio Grande has ever known
will quickly disappear and later when
needed by 200,000 thirsty acres in the
valley below will be released and led
through . a net work of canals and
ditches through New Mexico into Tex
as, clear down into Old Mexico.
The Settlers Pay tHe Cost.
It will cost millions to do this work,
$7,000,000 is the figure, but what of
that? The settlers will gladly pay for
it. Under the magic of irrigation Me
silla, La Palomas and El Paso val
leys, now only dotted here and there
with green verdure, will spring into
full fruitage, producing harvests unri
valled in. quality and quantity. Ten
thousand new homes will cover the
desert plain, and El Paso, the central
point for transportation and the great
est market In the valley, will wax into
a city of 100,000 souls. Twenty thou
sand acres of irrigated land support a
splendid city now. What shall it .be
when 200,000 acres are added to the
crop producing area of El Paso terri
tory? .
THE INTELLIGENCE OF ANIMALS
An English Naturalist Believes That
It May be Far Greater
Than Imagined*
Sir John Lubbock has brought more
popular attention to the subject of tbe
mental capacity of animals than any
other writer. He has conducted many
careful investigations on the senses, in
stincts and Intelligence of animals and
insects. An interesting query pro
pounded by the English scientist re
lates to the existence of other organs
of sense than ours.
"We find," he says, "in animals com
plex organs of sense, richly supplied
with nerves, but tbe function of which
we are as yet powerless to explain.
There may be fifty other senses as dif
ferent from ours as sound is from
sight, and even within the boundaries
of our own senses there may be end-
Jess sounds which we cannot hear, and
colors as different as red from green,
of which we have no conception. These
and a thousand other questions re
main for solution. The familiar world
which surrounds us may be a totally
different place to other animals. To
them it may be full of music which we
cannot hear, of sensations we cannot
conceive. To place stuffed birds ■ and
beasts in glass cases, to arrange in
sects In cabinets, and dried plants in
drawers, is merely the drudgery and
preliminary of study; to watch their
habits, to understand their relations to
one another, to study their instincts
and intelligence, to ascertain their
adaptations and their relations to the
forces of nature, to realize what the
world appears to them— these con
stitute, as it seems to me, at least, the
true interests of natural history, and
may even give us the clue to senses
and perceptions of which at present
we have no conception."

COMMERCIAL DISHONESTY.
AN ACKNOWLEDGED TRAIT OF
JAPANESE 3IERCHANTS.
They Have No Regard For a Con
tract — Striking Contrast With
Chinese Traders. • C".'
With the treaty of peace, Japan has
seen the accomplishment bf a task
that has been the ambition of the em
pire—to hold front rank in the fam
ily of nations.. This has been brought
about through such military achieve
ments as have evoked the admiration
of the civilized powers, but now it
seems that Japan has still before her
a problem which means harder work
and a greater task than that which
she had before the commencement of
the Russian-Japanese war.
That task, is to redeem the commer
cial reputation of her traders, a repu
tation which is not enviable. Joseph
Walton, a member of the English par
liament, a man Vho has spent much
time in travel and knows the people of
the East thoroughly, says in his book
on the Orient:
"Japanese traders are not special
ly distinguished for honesty, particu
larly in their business, relations with
foreigners. We have in this a »ost
striking proof that. the character of
the people is largely formed by. the
nature of their surroundings. For hun
dreds of years the trading class in
Japan has occupied a very low place
in the social scale. In the last thirty
years, siace the feudal system has
oeen abolished, the position of the
traders has greatly changed, and now
some of those who were nobles are en
gaged in trade; and I am told there
is reason to hope that shortly busi
ness affairs in Japan will be conducted
on more honest lines."
Peculiar Business Dishonesty.
The progress which the Japanese
have made in the past fifty years
shows them to be • a people self
reliant and determined to keep on ad
vancing towards the highest plane at
tainable, yet travelers in. the East
have been surprised that the traders
of the Occident are so notoriously dis
honest, for while the Japanese are far
superior to the Chinese a's regards
achievement of national strength and
perseverance, yet the reverse is true
in the matter of commercial honesty.
It appears that the Japanese mer
chants have no regard for a contract.
It is said that the most prosperous
commercial houses of Japan are man
aged not by Japanese but by Chinese.
The average Chinese merchant is high
ly esteemed the world over for his hon
esty; in fact a president of one of the
.argest corporations of the United
States once said that he would not be
afraid to ship a barrel of gold coin to
a Chinese merchant with instructions
to make use of It in trade, but at the
end of the year he would receive a de
tail statement of where every coin
went, but if this were dona to a Jap
anese merchant, be would consider
himself lucky to get back tbe empty
barrel.
It is believed that the bard task
accomplished by the Japanese in the
war just happily brought to an end
will be a begianing to bring out the
genius for which the Japanese have
been noted in war to a utilization of
peace and commercialism.

TEE MEERSCHAUM PIPE.
Almost Impossible to Select a
Genuine One.
'A story is told of a smoker who spent
eight of the best years of bis life trying
to color a meerschaum pipe, keeping it
enclosed most of the time in a case so as
to prevent it getting scratched and its
finish being dulled by the oil and moist
ure from his bands, only to find at the
end of that period that he had been
tenderly nursing an imitation instead
of the genuine "ecume de mer." The
best imitation is composed of the par
ings of genuine meerschaum, combined
with a mineral clay. These composi
tions can usually be determined from
the genuine meerschaum by their
greater weight, but there is no abso
lutely certain tost for distinguishing
the counterfeit. One method of test is
to look for slight imperfections. Com
position bowls never exhibit these
slight blemishes, which result from the
presence of foreign bodies in tbe natur
al meerschaum ; however, as tbe blem
ishes do. not usually manifest them
selves until after the bowl has been
used for some time, the test is not of
much value in buying new pipes.
Meerschaum is a silicate of magnesia,
and preparatory to carving it is soaked
in a composition of wax and oil. Tbe
wax and oil absorbed by the meer
schaum are the cause of tbe coloring
of the pipe due to smoking, and in con
nection with the further absorption of
nicotine. Where meerschaums have
been smoked for some time without
having acquired a good color, they can
frequently be improved by rubbing,
when warm, with beeswax.

AN ENGLISHMAN WITH HUMOR.
How He Held His First Job and More-

Herbert Kelcey.ipne of the leading
actors of the present time, is an
Englishman, but, unlike the usual type
from tbe Island has a deep sense of
humor. In speaking of his first visit to
this country, he • describes his exper
ience something like this:
"Yes, I was a bit green when I came
over to this country, and I 'ad to tike

Pretty soon a ; lidy walked up and
asked me where she should tike the

and she went aw'y. I looked at the

WANGLED SKEIN
She was sitting astern, in a pretty
frock of blue and white, and a big
hat shading her eyes from the sun.
She was reading a book: while waiting
for the boat to start. The Spray, a
small pleasure steamer, tugged at her
mooring ropes off Brighton pier.
The Honorable Geoffrey Mannering
watched, from the deck of the West
Pier, this fragile figure of a girl. There
was something more than admiration
In his gaze.
"I've been caddish enough," he mut
tered. "The girl is scarcely more than
a stranger to me. The loan of an um
brella In a soaking downpour made us
acquainted. I should not have presum
ed upon such a triviality, but — but" —
he broke off as the siren of the Spray
shrieked" impatiently — "but I fell in
love with her upon the spot" he added,
"and that's the plain, sweet, madden
ing truth."
A band commenced to play softly
under the bridge of the boat. Verna
Moore glanced up at the sound, and
Geoffrey turned away swiftly, moving
off with long strides.
. "I must not"go; I must not, really."
he told himself. Heaven forbid that
I should win her heart! "
Verna had seen Geoffrey as he
turned away. A glow of color swam
into her cheeks, followed by a look of
disappointment
Verna Moore was a governess. She
had been sent to Brighton to recover
from the effects of an illness. She
had met Geoffrey Mannering there for
the first time.
-*'Yes, I'm in love; but, having made
the confession to myself, I must forget
it drop this affair like a hot coal,"
Geoffrey told himself. "It is just mad
ness, and Claire . coming down to
Brighton to-day!" "■
Madness, it was. For the Hon. Geof
frey Mannering was engaged . to be
married to Claire Ashberry, a baro
net's daughter, and an heiress. It had
been an early attachment; it had grad
ually developed into an engagement,
partly because everyone expected that
it would, and Society insisted upon it
Yet now, Geoffrey remembered certain
"IT WAS NOT GOOD-BYE— AFTER ALL!"
words which Claire Ashberry once
spoke to him.
"I have always liked you," she had
said, "and am willing to become your
wife; yet I must tell you that anoth
er^ — you need not know his name —
awoke a feeling deeper than liking, and
claimed my heart. But there were ob
stacles in the way; my parents came
between us, and he went abroad, prom
ising never to see me again."
Again the Spray shrieked for more
passengers for her trip to "Worthing.
She would start in five minutes. Geof
frey hesitated.
A hand was laid npon his shoulder,
and a voice said, speaking in a low
tone:
"Why, Mannering, is it you?"
Geoffrey turned. He was face to
face with an exceedingly, handsome
man.
"Molyneux — yon!"
"Hush! for heaven's sake!" expostu
lated the other, turning pale.
"Ah! You are watched — as usual?
Still playing your deep and perilous
games? j
"Yes, yes. I'm in a bad fix, a tight
corner, I must hide for a spell."
"What— in England? In Brighton? I
could understand it in Vienna — where
we met last six years back. A political
spy who steals a secret from the Aus
trians might as well be in Vesuvius
as on Austrian soil, and "
"No, yon are wrong, I'm wanted In
England. Certain papers I obliged the
German Government with. You under
stand?"
- Geoffrey drew back, his face flushed
with anger. "What!" he exclaimed,
you stooped so low as that?"
"A fortune was in it"
"You traitor!"
"Curse it! Speak quietly. I belong
to no nationality. I serve all who ask
me. You know that. Come, hide me
somewhere! For old times' sake!"
A bell clanged on board the Spray.
Geoffrey snatched at his card case,
scribbling a line. "There," he said,
"go to the Hotel C — , give my man
that card. He'll look after you until
I come."
"A thousand thanka. Geoffrey. If
tver— " The- sentence was left nifli
ished. Mannering's resolution had
broken down at the last moment He
would make the trip to Worthing after
all.
"Put your hands higher up, Verna,
nearer to my neck. W* are safe if
you keep still."
The swimmer rose on the crest of a
long green swell, travelling shoreward.
A terrible explosion had occurred in
the engine room of the Spray. She
had sunk in less than fifteen minutes,
■with her return journey but half ac
complished. There had been no panic,
but her two boats were filled to the
very gunwales with their human
freight. Six men were venturing to
swim to meet the boats, putting off
from the shore. Geoffrey Mannering
was one of them. He had assured
Verna of his ability to save her if she
would trust herself to him rather than
to the overladen boats.
Verna kept perfectly still. Her feet
trailing in the water gave her a terri
fying sensation as of floating upon in
finite depth.
The strong frame of the swimmer
supporting her moved forward with
its steady strokes. How calm he seem
ed; how confident! At that moment she
loved him most; yet at that moment
she knew that she might never be
his.
On the return journey to Brighton,
Geoffrey had told her all; had made
his confession. He had said: "I love
you; loved you from the day that we
met. "That is all my defence."
There had been a long and dreadful
pause, while she wrestled with her
pain, with her temptation. Then she
had answered: "We must say goodbye.
We must never meet again. When we
land, we must shake hands, for the last
time. You could not help loving me
any more than I could help loving you.
Yes, I love you; but this is a barrier
which we cannot overcome.".
And then, almost immediately after
wards, the accident had occurred. The
sea was very cold; the warm suns of
summer had not yet penetrated its
chilly bosom. He was becoming stiff
with cold. The girl's weight, which
had felt so light at first, now pressed
him lower and lower . The sea kept
washing over his face. Onward he
swam, though drawing now upon that
strength which despair will give. At
a furlong from the shore he was seen.
A boat turned his way. Then came
a final struggle to keep afloat. He was
dragged on board with his burden
when at the point of utter exhaustion.
The journey shoreward gave him
time to recover strength. With hia
own hands he lifted Verna into a cab.
They were driTen to taer lodgings in
Old Steyne. He took her in his arms
and gave her one long, passionate kiss.
Then, with a repressed sob, he left
her. He waa never to meet Verna
again. She had pointed his way of
duty, and he must follow it
Geoffrey turned his steps toward his
hotel.
It was afternoon. A procession of
every conceivable kind of carriage
rolled along the King's Road. By the
Brunswick lawns, tearing along the
front at a mad speed, came a powerful
motor car. The driver was a man, and
at his side, closely veiled, sat a lady.
Scarcely perceiving the rushing car,
Geoffrey crossed in front of it. A loud
shout and a furious bellow from a horn
made him look up as he dashed for
ward.
Surely he knew the driver? And that
veiled lady? Something in the poise of
her body suggested a name — but no,
he told himself that he was half silly,
nearly dropping with fatigue.
Geoffrey staggered into his rooms.
His valet met him just in time to save
him from falling. For at that mo
ment his senses left him. and he lost
consciousness. .
It was an hour before the accident
which sank the Spray in six fathoms
off Brighton beach.
Richard Molyneux, ex-army officer,
gamester, spy, duellist, waited In much
perturbation in Geoffrey's private sit
ting room at the Hotel C .
Molyneux noticed that the space be
tween the portico grounds and the
distant sea was patrolled by a gen
tlemanly-looking fellow.
"Again!" growled' Molyneux. "I seem
unable to give that brute the slip."
Through the open window he heard
the roar of a motor-car. It ceased as
it drew, near to the building. Up and
down paced the fugitive, fuming and
fretting.
Suddenly he turned swiftly. *. The
door was open, and he heard the
voice of Geoffrey's servant:
"No, he will not be long," madam;
and if you will wait — ah, I had for
gotten."
A well-dressed and beautiful figuro
entered the room. Seeing Molyneux,
she uttered a sry of astonishment.
Molyneux, whose feelings never be
trayed him, turned to the servant and
dismissed him with a couple of words.
Then he faced the newcomer; he took
her hands; he looked long and ardent
ly Into her face, which paled, then
burned with crimson. - "•
"Claire! You here? After all these
years!" —
The woman trembled. In a moment
the deeps of a passion she believed she
had sealed forever, broke forth. She
clung, almost fainting, to his broad
shoulders. Richard Molyneux it waa
whom she had loved in the past. Ho
exercised an extraordinary fascination
over Claire Ashberry. . : ,,'
"I came to see Geoffrey," she ex
plained hurriedly. "I am staying at
Hastings., He expected me at Brigh
ton to-day. I came over to tell him
that I must defer my visit That is
all. And yyoyou — you — what are you do
ing here, in this room? Geoffrey's
room?" • .
"Didn't you know that he was a
friend of mine?"
"A friend — to you?" Claire disengag
ed herself from those strong arms.
"I mi him two hours back. He
promised to'hide me."
"To hide you?" The voice rang out
in alarm. "True enough."
Molyneux laughed bitterly. "Come
here," said he, drawing her to the win
dow. "You see that man — ah, there are
three of them. Trapped!"
Forgetful of everything save his
dasher, Claire Ashberry clung to MOI7.
neux's arm. "Who are they, Richard?
Who are those men?" she demanded
imperiously.
"Police officers. Let me go, dear one.
Yes, the old game. State papers; a se
cret sold. You'd better let me go. I
must escape. . •
"You must escape; you shall!" cried
Claire, wildly. t,
"How?" The thing's impossible. If
I had a fast car — " - '
You have! There is mine; it is wait
ing for me. Come — oh, come quickly ! "
she implored.
For an instant Molyneux stood irrea
solule; then he said quite calmly:
"I will. And you?"
"I go with you," said Claire steadily.
"I shall strike northward into the
Dover road, if possible, and quit Eng
land to-night," he answered.
"Where you go, I go also," said
Claire. _
They ran from the room. The car
waited at the rear of the hotel. A
minute later they were flying like a
gale down the King's Road.
"You mean to tell me, Clarkson, se
riously, that I have been in bed thr«e
days?"
"Three days, sir" answered Geof
frey's servant. -
"A queer yarn, this, that you tell me
about those two visitors." went on
Geoffrey, thoughtfully. "They went off
together, you say? Geoffrey broke the
seal of the letter which had just ar
rived, and which bore a foreign post
mark. He sat as if stunned, while his
eyes read again and again one passage
in the communication:
"Call my conduct madness, or by
whatever term you will. I cannot fight
against fate. I have married Richard
Molyneux: We shall live abroad. He
has promised me many things. Forgive
me, Goeffrey; or if you cannot forgive,
forget me."
Geoffrey rose after a long silence.
He turned his steps toward the Old
Steyne, but he had not covered a hun
dred yards before he saw her — Verna— -/
sitting on a chair on the Brunswick
lawna. She was looMng out to sea. A
gorgeous sunset had purpled the wa
ters of the channel.
Geoffrey went up to her, softly, slow
ly, so that she did not hear his ap
proach. And, leaning over her chair,
suddenly, he whispered in her ear:
"Verna, it was not good-bye — after
all!."
LION AGALSST TIGER.
Greater Bravery Shown By the
Smaller Animal.
The owner of a one-ring circus trav
eling through the West this summer
found himself in sore straits through
the death of a much advertised lion
which was the star attraction of the
show. With a fertility born of ne
cessity he advertised in the nearby
papers for a "brave man." A good,
strapping Irisnman applied for the po
sition. . ■
"My pet lion has just died," said the
showman, "and I will give you $5
a day if you will robe yourself in his
skin and go through his tricks. All
you have is two performances a day;
cash money." The Irishman Teadily
assented to the proposition and being
of bright wit and intelligence soon
learned all that was required of him.
The first afternoon of the show he
went through the paces well, enclosed
in a large iron cage and occasionally
emitting a roar to startle the guileless
countrymen. In the evening the man
ager thought he would cap the climax
by announcing to the audience that lie
would place the lion in the tiger's
cage. On hearing this the son of Erin
was terrified beyond comprehension.
However, with trembling steps he went
into the tiger's cage, but at once crept
up into a corner, praying to himself.
"Faith, God help me in this terrible
trouble," he moaned. "Kape away
from me the scratches of the big cat."
"G'wan," replied the tiger, "phwat

meself too a wearer of the green?"

Experience of an Old-Timer in
the Wilds of Idaho.
"In the wi»ter of '07," said an old
miner, now in Uncle Sam's service,
at Washington, '■' I was living in a
cabin by myself in the mountains of
Idaho, about seven miles from Idaho
City, my nearest and only, neighbor
the postmaster, an Irishman and
bachelor, who-kept the toll house be
tween Idaho City and the adjoining
mountain towns.
"My cabin was about two miles
to the East, directly among the
mountains. The snow which had
been falling at intervals for several
months, lay about 10 feet on a level
around my cabin, and my only
method of travel was by snow shoes.
"I had made my tri-weekly run to
see if the stage had brought any let
ters to the toll house -for me; and
while adjusting my snow shoes, pre
paratory to starting back, I heard a
bellowing and pawing. A Texas
steer, which had separated - himself
from the herd which had ■ lately
passed toward the town, was angrily
shaking his head at me about 100
feet distant He had run past the
house from the road up the little
stiaight path which Pat had kept
open to his spring, and after drink
ing and turning around, had become
bewildered, the snow being at least
eight feet deep on either side of the
path. . .
"This was my direct route home.and
although, if I had kept on top of the
snow, he could not have pursued me,
the spirit of my school-boy days re
vived, and I removed my snow shoes
and immediately made two little Icy
snow balls. . At right angles with
the path to the spring another and a
similar path had been cleared to a
cabin about the. same distance from
the toll bouse. As I fired the two

balls in rapid succession, striking
him with one in his eye, and with
the other on his forehead, the steer
again. bellowed with rage, and lower
ing his read, made a rush for me.
Of course I could have simply turned
and gone in the toll Hurase, but I
thought to prolong the excitement,
and so made a dash for the cabin.
As I neared it, I saw with dismay
that it was unoccupied and fastened
with chain and padlock on the out
side. The path ended at the cabin
with ten feet of snow piled at my
left and in fronCthe walls as smooth
and perpendicular as a house.
"One thinks quickly at such mo
ments, and the ridge pole which usu
ally extends from miners' cabins a
foot or more beyond the main build
ing on which to hang meat and game
proved my salvation. I do not know
how- high a jump I made to grasp it,

WHEN LOST IN THE WOODS.
If You Have an Axe, You May Not
Have a Bad Time.
To get lost "in the woods is not an
uncommon occurrence, and what to do
under the circumstances is so well told
by Horace Kephart in "Field and
Stream" that readers fond of camping
and woodcraft will be interested :
"The first thing that one should do
when he realizes that he has lost his
bearings in a wild country is to stop
and sit down. Don't take one more
step until you have recovered your wits
so that you can trace on the ground
with a stick your probable course
since leaving the camp, and mark on it
the estimated location of such water
courses and other landmarks as you
have passed. Then make up your mind
that if you -must stay out all night,
alone in the woods, it is no killing
matter, but likely an interesting ad
venture. . Having recovered your men
tal balance, take note of the lay of the
land around you, the direction of its
drainage, the character of its vegeta
tion, and the hospitalities that it offers
to a night-bounditraveler, in the way
of drinking-water, sound down wood,
natural shelter and browse. Then
blaze a tree on four sides— make big
blazes that can be seen from any di
rection. Do this even though there be
several hours of daylight ahead, and al
though you have no present Intention
of staying here; for yon do know that
this spot is only so saany hoars from
camp by back trail, and that yon may
have good reason to return to it
"Now' try to get an outlook over the
surrounding country. In flat woods
this will be difficult If you can risk
climbing a tall tree do so. Select one
that you can climb, and having gained
your outlook, note the compass direc
tion of watercourses and other land
marks, mapping, them on a bit of
paper, for a lost man's memory is
treacherous. The courses of small
streams show where the main valley
lies. Decide where to go, take the' com
pass direction, note how the sun strikes
it, and descend.
"Now, as you travel, make -bush
marks by making blazes on trees or
breaking a shrub here and there along
the trail, so yon will easily follow your
way back should you have to pass the
night in the woods."
Americans Going to Mexico,
During the last two years over 1,500
immigrants from Oklahoma and other
parts of the Southwest have located
in the single State of Tamaulipas,
Mexico. They hare made a settlement
known as the Blaylock Colony, just
west of Eseandon on the Gulf Rail
way, and have built churches, school
houses and stores, and enjoy the
fullest liberty at action. So it seems
that Americans are crossing the
southern boundary as they are the
northern one to Canada.

7 Monroe Street Chicago, IIL. U. S. A.THE PICTURESQUE DAIRIES
OF EUROPE.
Government Investigation Shows
Them Below the American Standard.
We often hear of the model dairies
of Europe, co-operative dairies into
which a speck of dirt is never allowed
: to lodge, of Danish butter that is in
truth a dream and brings a fabulous
price, of eggs guaranteed fresh and
country-like, and other reports of the
way they do things on the fine old
farms of Europe until one begins to
think that one can not be more than
half living in this country. But how
much of this sort of thing will bear
investigation and close analysis?
The Dairy Division of the United
Sates Department of Agriculture is a
progressive and useful institution and
has done several things to destroy
prevailing fallacies and incidentally
establish the fact that American meth
ods as a whole, in at least some phases
of agriculture, are as far if not farther
advanced than those of any other coun
try.
Not the least interesting of such in
formation gathered was that collected
by the late Henry E. Alvord, for many
years the chief of the Dairy Division,
in a tour of the countries of Europe
SELLING MILK IN DENMARK.
for the purpose of looking into the
dairy industry of the continent
Major Alvord stated first, upon his
return home, that while the United
States has never evolved a strictly
dairy cow of its own, it has now noth
ing to gain through the importation
of new blood from Great Britain, the
Channel Islands, the Netherlands, Den
mark or France. There are many pic
turesque and useful breeds of milch
cattle in these countries but they do
not compare, he stated, with the adapt
ed American breeds. For . instance,
Holland Cheese
Market.
Danish Prize
Winners,
Brittany, in the north of France, has
within its borders pretty, active little
black-and-white cattle with marked
dairy characteristics, producing often
an astounding quantity of milk for
their size, but they are believed to be
useful in the United States only as
playthings. *• '■• •-:
American Cow Stables Up to Average
In the stabling and general care of
dairy cows no foreign country shows,
in general practice, any methods or
conditions better than our own. While
the average conditions throughout the
country are undoubtedly far from
what they should be, the United States
MODEL CO-OPERATIVE FRENCH
CREAMERY
farmer and dairyman are making as
rapid strides forward as can be found
anywhere.
Major -Alvord found comparatively
few places in Holland and Switzerland
where there is such close relationship
between the dairy cows and families
as the occupancy of connecting apart
ments, so often described in poetic
fancy by European travelers. These
GUY ELLIOTT MITCHELL
conditions do exist abroad— where the I
cow is taken in as a member of the
family — as they do in no place in the
United States, but they are the excep
tion. Stables which in summer are
converted into conservatories ' and
rooms for weaving and cheese curing
are the unusual and show places. The
construction of cow stables generally in
the dairy countries of the Old World ,
is of a substantial nature, with little'
regard paid to light and ventilation,
COMBINED DWELLING AND COW STABLE IN DENMARK-STABLE IN FRONT
conveniences of arrangement or ease
in cleaning. While much attention is
paid to cleaning cow stables, it is ap
parently more from an appreciation of
the value of the manure than from an
effort to have sanitary conditions in
the dairy.
Foreigners Provide Good Feed.
There is one thing where Europeans
may be ahead -of Americans. They
seem to **c better versed in the feeding
of cattle. Even the poorest > peasants
do not hestitate to purchase concentra
ted cattle foods where necessary, yet it
appears that the only reason the na
tives can give for this practice is the
stereotyped answer: — "My father did
so." . :^
The American farmer. Major Alvord
thought, has undoubtedly a much more
intelligent knowledge of the principles
of feeding, but there is probably more
carelessness and waste in feeding ani
mals of all kinds in America than any
where else in the world, ; •
The most astonishing feature of Eu
rope in the care of milk on the farm is
the entire absence of refrigeration in
France, and the general ignoring of
the value of cold in dairying. In the
matter of dairy appliances and equip
ment, the United States is surpassed,
by no other country, although Den
mark and parts of Great Britain stand
about as well.
In most big cities of Europe there
are a few well-conducted milk delivery
establishments, such as are usually
found in our smallest cities, while in
some localities dairy animals are
driven through the streets and milked
at customers' doors. Milch cows are
managed in the same way even in the
best streets of Paris -J and of, Rome.
Paris probably has the poorest milk
service of any of the large cities. Dur
ing the Exposition at Paris in July,
1900, a special show of perishable dairy
products was held as an annex to that
exposition..
Paris Milk Exhibit Very Poor.
While the French producers had
every opportunity of exhibiting their
goods in the best possible shape, the
only samples of natural milk and
cream, absolutely free from chemical
preservatives and uncooked, which
were sweet and palatable after noon
of the exhibition day, were from the
dairies in New York and New Jersey,
then eighteen days from the cow! The
American products had been preserved
solely by cleanliness and cold. Major
Alvord made the statement on his re
turn from Europe that no milk-supply
company in Europe could duplicate this
performance.
In butter-making, while there is am
pie room for improvement in our coun
try, the only foreign country from
which the United States can possibly,
learn anything. is Denmark. There the*
best creameries are models of cleanli
ness, good order, and systematic man
agement But all these details are ac
complished only through a lavish ex
penditure of labor which would appal
an American creamery manager. It is
not an uncommon thing for six or
eight <■ persons to be constantly em
ployed for six or eight hours a day,
turning out a quantity of butter which
is ordinarily made in this country by
a man and a boy whe have all the work
finished daily at 3 or 4 o'clock in the
afternoon.
Major Alvord found it impossible to
draw any comparisons between the
methods of cheese-making and the re
sults in this country and those abroad.
It is believed that the American ' fac
tory system, common to the United
States and Canada, is superior to any
thing elsewhere. In variety and fancy
cheese this continent' can not yet at-
tempt to compete with the Old World.
In order to learn the bottom facts
about making any of the famous spe
cialties in cheese, it is necessary to go
to the locality where they originate.
Making Dairy Work Popular..
Americans find novelty in Europe in
the "fairs" and "markets" where prod
ucts of the dairy are sold to the highest
bidder. In Normandy the wives and
daughters of farmers and peasants as
semble by the hundred in the parks or
along the streets, selling their
"mottes" of butter. The cheese fairs
of Frome, England, and Kilmarnock,
Scotland, and the street markets of
Alkmaar, Hoorri; and Utrecht, Holland,
also present lively alid interesting
spectacles in connection- with the sale
of dairy products.
Major Alvord's observations show
that while too much can not be said
of the industry, frugality and thrift of
Europe's dairymen, a close comparison
leads one to feel that the conditions of
the industry in the United States are
decidedly more satisfactory in almost
every particular.
Wholesome Cider Vinegar.
In an ordinary cheap restaurant the
safest thing tojdo if you wish to use
some vinegar on~your food is to try and
get half a lemon. Then you will know
that you are not eating out the lining
of your stomach with caustic chemi
cals. Vast quantities of "pure cider
vinegar" "are quite innocent of the
meaning of apples and are distinctly
injurious, being purchased by the re
tail dealer in barrels, at seven to ten
cents a gallon, which every apple grow
er knows is a prohibitive price for
cider vinegar.  However, real ci-Jer
vinegar is a good condiment. The rea
son it can not be sold for the prices at
which chemical vinegar is offered' is
that it takes from one to three years
to make properly.
The cider first must go through the
process of alcoholization, and then be
changed into acetic acid. There are
methods of artificially hastening this
process, but the product is not first
class, and it can only be done on a

large scale. The ordinary big green
cucumber pickles are , usually quite
free from cider vinegar. The only way
to make them edible is to soak the
pickles in strong brine, to extract the
acid, then to soak them in water to
get out the brine, and finally pickle
them in real vinegar. . -
Pure vinegar can be made as well
from other fruits as' from -apples.
Grapes,- plums, and other fruits which
contain a considerable - proportion of
sugar, which is converted into alcohol
and then into acetic acid, make good
vinegar.
The Department of Agriculture has
in press a short bulletin on vinegars,
which can be had upon application to
members of Congress. It is known as
Farmers' Bulletin No. 233 and is com
