; Talk With Mr.' Gallup Abont Whom
j He Should Select For Hla Second
Wife.
[Copyright, 1900, by C. B. Lewis.]
After supper Mr. Gallup had gone
over to the store for a whetstone and a
paper of. carpet tacks, and as he went
Mrsl Gallup was "washing up the dishes
1 and singing "The Home Over There"
! with ? great feeling. .■■; He , returned in
half an hour, and as he . reached . the
kitchen door the sound of sobbing met
■ his " ears: ;He looked in ; to ' find ; Mrs.
Gallup weaving back aud forth on a
chair. with her check apron at her eyes.
Something . had happened. He didn't
Inquire what it was, but turned about
and sat on the doorstep and in an ab
sent way began sharponlus a sickle
with the stone. he had bought. It was
five minutes before Mrs. Gallup volun
teered an explanation. When she saw
that he had neither anxiety nor sym
pathy, she hitched her chair Into tlie
doorway, used a fresh . spot on the
apron to wipe her eyes and finally said:
"Samuel, when you've got that sickle
sharpened you might go over to Mrs.
Bebee's and tell her that I shall be a
dead woman before tomorrer. You
"GIT READY TO BE AN ANGEL I"
needn't beat around the bush at all,
but tell her right out. She'll rather be
.. expectin the news. She was over here
this afternoon, and she said I was lia
ble to git my summons at any time.
' I've got It all arranged with her about
the funeral."
Mr. Gallup did not look around. With
calm deliberation he spat on the whet
stone, and with calm deliberation he
drew it back and forth across the
blade.
'. "Yes, Samuel, my time, has come!"
. sobbed Mrs. Gallup after waiting a
reasonable time for him to speak. "A
few hours hence and you will be a
widower, and a few days hence you
will be wearing a red necktie and can
terin around after a second wife. When
you started over town, I was as happy
as a lark and hadn't the slightest idea
of dyln. Ten minutes later when I
went to carry the butter down cellar
there came seven knocks on that emp
ty cider bar'l, and as I stood there
shakfn I heard a whispered voice a-say
. in, 'Hanner Gallup,' git ready to be an
angel!' ; It was my summons, and I've
got to go. Nobody kin hold back agin
a summons. What kind of a second
wife shall you marry, Samuel?" «
■■■ Mr. Gallup had paused in his labors
and was looking absently at a robin in
a cherry tree.
"You needn't feel at all dellkit about
talkin it over with me," said Mrs. Gal
lup as she dabbed at her eyes 1 with the
■ iaprpn v ''I've allus s'pected you'd. git
k J married * agin if I should A\e, and I
shan't howl and squeal sb'out It. Mrs.
Bebee says if her husband marries
agin she'll haunt him, but you needn't
bo afraid of me. I'd 'rather you mar
' ried agin. If you didn't, you'd be goin
to circuses and dogfights and candy
pulls and become as wicked as Silas
Johnson. S'pose you've kinder ' had
your eye out,-* hev'n't you, Samuel—
that . is, you've kinder made up your
mind about what sort of a woman
you'd marry 7"'" § # •\. \
Mr. Gallup .withdrew big gaze from
the robin and returned to his work of
sharpening- the sickle, and Mrs. Gal
lup' 6 nose had grown very red with the
pulling- when she continued: .
''There's the Wldder Lapham, Sam
uel, and everybody says she's wuth
$2,000, but I wouldn't want you to mar
ry, her. She's {oo hity tlty for a man
of age. 'While she was swingln
in a hammock she'd let the bread burn
up In the oven. -She'd want you to go
off to a picnic every day in the- year,
and if you had any soft soap In the
house you'd hey to buy it. And there's
the Wldder Davis. She's a good bouse-
, keeper,' Samuel, as I'll admit, but they
Kay kli» gits streaks on. One day she'll
be laughin and gigglin all day long, and
■ the' : next :! day i ''Bhe'li : 'be : 'as u sulky as a
mule. She kin' make* a pound of tea
go as fur as I kin, but" she told me
jvith her own mouth that she had four
pairs of stockin's last year. Could you
put up with slch extravagance as that,
Samuel? Wouldn't you be thinkln of
how I allus got along on two pairs a
year?"
Mr. Gallup whistled softly to himself
as he felt of the edge of the sickle with
jtijs' ftfnnib. 1 The wbis£Jfr : conveyed no
direct information, but was a whistle
In the abstract Mrs. Gallup looked at
the back of his neck for a moment and
worked up andT cb.oked~D*ack "a sod aSu
j then said: : : ■  . ■ ■,: -

the shoulder or poked me in the ribs.
I— i"- ■ ■- .. . • . j ■; ■
The remembrance that there ha(i
been no shoulder patting or ear pulling,
during all those long years brought : a
fresh outburst of emotion, and* for two
'minutes' Mrs. Gallup sobbed bitterly.
Mr. Gallup laid down the whetstone
and the sickle and picked up the paper
of tacks and balanced it on the point
of his finger, but he was oblivious of
his surroundings. . ■
. "I— l don't complain, Samuel" said
Mrs. Gallup when she could control her
voice again. : "When I saw that yon
j was no hand to pet, I let it go. . I'm old
arid wrinkled and scrawny, and I can't
look . fur pettin. It will be different
with a gal, however. If you don't pull
her ear at least once a week and call
her angel, she'll git sulky and finally
run away with" -'a*,' tin. peddler. Mrs.
Bebee was sayln that Bertha Williams
would make a Rood gal wif&,fur you,
and Mrs. Williams says that you conld
not do better than to marry Mary
Hawkins, but I ain't goin to pick out
nobody fur yon nor find fault wltb
your choice. All I'm goin tor do Is -to
die rand become an angel and let you
do* jest, as you want to. ' I've got Jest
one leetle favor to ask." '." ■ '■'- -■• .
The lump In her throat and the |ears
In her eyes checked her speech for
lialf a minute, and during that time
Mr. Gallup put the tacks down and
lifted up the sickle again.
"It's only this. Samuel.' You needn't
do no weepin fur me when I'm gone,
and you needn't bang over the gate
and try to look all broke up over my
loss. You kin go right to playin check
ers as soon as the funeral is over, but
some night, later on, when you are all
alone in the. house and the crickets
are singin. I want you to remember
'hat I had my good p'lnts as well as
my bad. I want you to remember that
I used a clothes bller with seven holes
in the bottom fur nine years without
niendin and that I hain't had a new
corset fur 'leven years. Our teakettle
is over 0 years old, and I've made one
set of cups and sassers last us since
we, was married. That's all. Samuel,
and now I'U go In and die, and yov kin
be lookln around fur your second
wife!" ,:;',-;
She rose up with a sob and retreated
into the house, but Mr. Gallup knew
nothing of it. He hung the sickle on
a nail near the door, put the whetstone
and tacks on a shelf In the wood shed,
and then walked down the path and
closed ; the - henhouse door and cast a
look into the pig pen. When he re
turned to the house. Mrs. Gallup was
looking at her bowl of emptyings under
the stove and humming the air of "I
Want to Be an Angel." She had had
her lamentation and got over it and It
would be three or four days before she
would break out again. M. Quad.
WHY HE LIKES MUSIC.
A Pbyalclan Whose Reputation an a
Critic Was Blaatefl.
There's a physician in Baltimore who
adores music. His taste, to be sure,
runs rather to "Old Black Joe," "Su
wannee River" and such classics, but
still any sort of music will do, and he
listens to it all ecstatically and with a
properly Intelligent look on his face.
It was therefore believed that he had
a fine taste for harmony, and.his.repu
tation as a critic was established and
grew apnee as reputations will, good or
bpd.
The other evening as his daughter
approached the house In which this:
physician lived she heard the strains
of "Home, Sweet Home," proceeding
from the library.
"Father's at It again," she said to
herself softly. "I wonder who he has
coerced lnjto playing for him now?"
.A glance disclosed the fact that he
had bribed three street musicians, two
violinists and a harpist Into "giving
him a private recital. They finished
Jhe air just as the young woman enter
ed, 'and the physician turned to her
with a beaming face. "That 'Nearer,
My God, to Me,' Is a beautiful thing.
Isn't It T" he asked.
It was the first time he had commit
ted himself on the subject of "tunes,"
and his glory began to diminish from
that moment, for his daughter told the
Incident as what she considered an ex
cellent Joke.
Now the worthy man says that he
likes music solely as an Incentive to
thought and listens to it when he wish
es to solve some knotty 'problem of ar
tery or twnes. Just as those who sijter
from Insomnia 'go' tb cfaurch'and listen
to the sermon to be put to sleep.—Balti

book on the 'Descent of Man?' " "Yes,
I have," said the bishop, whereupon
the young man continued: "What non
sense it is talking of our being de

see the use of such stuff. I can't see
what difference It would make to me If
my grandfather was an ape.;' ' ■ ••
': "No,* the b'ishdp v repllect;'^l don^t see
that it would. But It must have made
an amazing difference to your grand

JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY. CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. JANUARY 4. 1901.
ELECTION . DAY.
How It Came to Be Tuesday After
Ftrat Monday In November.
j The designation of the day for" hold
ing the presidential election Is left to
congress. The first act passed by it re
lating to that subject was In 1702. It
provided that presidential ■ electors
should j be appointed "within -84 days
before the first ; Wednesday In Decem
ber.". This left each state free to select
a day to suit itself within those limits.
Pennsylvania chose electors on the last
Friday In October. Other states elect
ed theirs on different days between the
beginning and middle of November.
- When Harrison was elected in 1840,
the Democrats asserted ' that his suc
cess was due partly to fraudulent vot
ing, which was made possible by the
lack of a definite election day.' It was
alleged that Kentucky and Ohio Whigs
had voted in both states, the election
being held on' different days. So in
1845 the Democrats passed the law
now on the statute books making the
first Tuesday after the first Monday
election day: vf.Tv* 7 ""
At that time but five of the 26 states
had . their elections In November. : In
Michigan and Mississippi voting was
carried on through two days— the first
Monday and the following Tuesday.
New York had three election days— the
first Monday, Tuesday and Wednes
day—but had finally confined voting to
the middle day, or the first Tuesday
after the first Monday. Massachusetts
chose state officers on the second Mon
day In November and Delaware on the
second Tuesday. So congress selected
the first Tuesday after the first Mon
day to consult the convenience of three
states out of five, one of the three be
ing the Important state of New York.—

A FAST BALL PLAYER
HE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE PLAYED
WITH THE ROARERS.
Steve j Speed, Who Con Id Bent | 818
Own Throw to First and Who Conld
Get Behind the Plate In Ttm» lo
Catch Hla Own Pitching.
"The fastest base runner I ever saw,"
said the fat ex-mascot of the Lightfoot
Lilies In comparing baseball of the
present with that of the old days, "was
little Sammie Salmon of the Lilies. But
the fastest base runner I ever heard of
was,' or wasn't, as the case may have
been,' Steve Speed, who played, or who
didn't play, I don't know which, with
the Ringtail Roarers. At any rate,
whether he ever played with the Roar
ers or not. he was certainly the fastest
that ever came ' over the ' crossways.
You don't understand? Well, I'll tell
you all about him. B : . ...
"One afternoon about a month before
the last game wo evfer played with the
Ringtail Roarers the boys were all sit
ting round in the postofflce discussing"
our chances for the big contest. Cap
tain Slugger Burrows, who was tend
ing postoffiee that day, was over in the
corner reading the ball news In a Jones
County Courier that had accidentally
slipped Its wrapper before delivery.
Suddenly he clutched the paper tight
ly and sprang to his'feet. For heaven's
sake, boys, listen to this: *We have it
from a. high source,' he began to read
breathlessly, 'that the Roarers have
unearthed a phenomenal base runner,
with services they feel confident
of wresting . the ■ Jones county laurels
from the' erstwhile Invincible Lightfoot
Lilies. The newcomer's name is Steve
Speed. His extraordinary ability was
first discovered while he was in the
box one day last week. He stopped an
easy grounder | and tossed It over to
first to catch the runner. The ball had
no sooner left his hand than, to his hor
ror, he discovered that first was uncov
ered. Without a moment's hesitation
he made a dive for the bag and suc
ceeded In reaching it just In time to
catch the ball that he had thrown but
an instant before, thereby scoring a
put out and an assist unassisted.'-
" 'Boys,' said the Slugger, crumpling
the paper savagely In his fists, 'to Lily
park, with you. Practice begins at
once. Hustle!'
' "Well, sir, that week we practiced.
In the morning the boys would all go
down to the station and race the trains
as they steamed out of town. After
noons they'd ease up a bjt and just in
jlu,lge in short sprints paced by the
town troller car. At night the daily
practice would conclude with a brisk
cross country run around the town
ship. The work began to show. A|
the end of the week we began to have
pome hopes of beating the Roarers aft
er all. And then came a. second copy
of The Courier knocking pur hopes
higher than tnxes.
I! (The wonderful baseball feat per
formed by Steve Speed,' the article
said, 'which was published exclusively
by The Jones County Courier, has been
eclipsed by an even more astonishing
performance by the same player. We
pare It from the same high source from
which we obtained our former news
that Speed has. now become so .proQ
clent In running that he Is able to
pitch the ball from the box and by an
incredibly quick start reach the plate
|n time to catch the ball behind the
bat. The Roarers jjave released thelv
catcher. 1 Wouldn't that hasten your
pulse? It did ours.
"And the next week's accounts were
even worse. The Courier got straight
from their own private high source
that this guy Speed was even better
than the week before. He T^as now so
super «t the game that he not only ran
down behind the plate and caught the
i>alls that he pitched, but In case the
flatter knocked a fly Ije darted out In
the field and caught it himself. The
Roarers had, according to The Courier,
released their whole outfield. When
We read that, Bull Thompson wanted to
Cancel the game, but the Slugger
wouldn't hear of It 'The Lightfoot
Lilies,' he said, 'may be made to look
like tarheel thistles, but we won't
wither before we're picked.'
"When the big game finally djd cp,me
off, $c Ro.arers certa.ln,ly had us on' the
. for three Innings they piled up
runs almost at w^. But then we be
gain to get wise. Where was this fast
running phenom? Cy Priest was still
\n the pitcher's box, and the whole out
field seemed to be In their usual places.
Perhaps he was sick. The thought
gave us courage, and we began to pick
up a bit. You all know how we finally
pulled the game out of the fire in the
fast half of the tenth. That's a mat
ter of history now. Well, after It was
ever the Slugger went up to Cy Priest
" 'Say.' he asked, 'Where's that hot
base runner of yours, Cy?"
'"You mean Steve Speed?" replied
Cy, with a funny look In his eye. 'Oh,
we couldn't pay the salary be demand
ed and had let him go.. The la'st'l
of him he was touring the north

''Yes, sir; he was the best that ever
was— lf he was. As I said, I don't real

■ An employee of the Chicago Tribune
once found the fact that his face was
familiar to the late Joseph Medlll de

years of his life Mr. ; Medill did not
spend much time in Chicago and took
no active part in the management of
his paper, but when he was in the city
he went to his office pretty regularly.'
; He knew all the old faces, but few of
the new ones, and It was too late In life
for him to accustom himself to them.
He never knew to whom to give "copy"

editor happened to be absent. On one
occasion he handed some to a repre

SALT WATER BLOOD.
An Operation That la the Saving of
Many Human Lltcb,
Transfusion of blood Is a procedure
that must have been employed by phy
sicians in very early times. Ovid tells
of Medea bringing back youth to the
aged by the Injection into their veins
of the blood of young men, and doubt
less the same means was employed by
physicians for less fantastic objects.
The Injection of the blood of one per
son Into the veins of another was until
recently done to save life. after severe
hemorrhage and in various forms of
blood poisoning. Sqmetlmes a direct
communication .was made between the
veins of the donor and of the recipient
by means of a tube. At other times the
healthy subject was bled Into a bowl
and the blood was beaten to' remove
the fibrin before It was passed into the
blood vessels of the patlen{.
The procedure {a a dangerous one,
however, although many lives have
been saved by It, and it has now been
almost entirely abandoned, a "much
safer plan being used.
It Is found that the blood, when de
flbrinated is no' longer a living fluid,
and the corpuscles It contains serve no
useful purpose when Injected, but rath
er act as foreign matter which must be
got rid of. Accordingly physicians now
use distilled water in which a definite
proportion of common salt and other
chlorides have been dissolved. This sq
lution Is. warmed and Is Injected slow
ly Into a vein at the bend of the elbow,
about a quart being used.
Often it is not even necessary to pour
the fluid into a vein, but simply to In
ject It through one or more hollow
needles Into the tissues beneath the
skin of the abdomen or the thigh.' .
This Is done not only to supply an
equivalent for fluid lost In hemorrhage
or cholera, but also In certain diseases
In which blood poisoning exists. In
this latter case a large a.mounT of fluid
Is injected slowly, and being taken UP
by the blood Is almost Immediately
excreted through the kjfljipy?, carrying
with' it much pi the poison which the
blood was unable to rid itself of un
aided, a '
This operation has been felicitously
called "blood washing," for this is
what it really Is, and to the process hu
" inanity owes the saving of many lives.

laundry where she had left a shirt
waist, bvi{ \\ could not be found, as
there was no entry In the book of hiero
glyphs corresponding to her pink slip.
After a half hour's search the China
man found the entry.; A mistake had
been made, so the entry was crossed
out and a new set of hieroglyphs In
tiny characters placed below. - She was
told tliat the waist would be laundered
Immediately, ancj she could get it the
next day.
The next day the young woman call
ed for^it, accompanied by three other
young women. At the seashore the ex
citement of a visit to the Chinese laun
dry Is not to be despised. The China
man to whom the pink slip wa» pre
sented was not the laundryman of the
day before, and he experienced, the
same difficulty In, finding the identify

The girl answered calmly, "I can find

Women can keep secrets, pTHMnvj '
They often keep secret for KJ(C.\^aS
a long time the fact that •lU/^j^SI
they are suffering from 'v/S\)»il
drains, inflammation, nicer- nJ'vJLxVA
ation, or female weakness. . v jwl0^flUTl
But they can't keep th,e m* kQzJUSs\
cret very long, because the CyfTrjUj
hollow eyes,' cheeks that 7\.Aj>*£yJl
have lost their freshness, and j£y|vy£Jn
the irritability which comes Jr4rrTjZ\|
from sorely tried nerves, all Cj-fSv
conspire to publish the sto- Q^VfTj
ry of suffering. The usual rr^ci^Sl
motive for such secrecy, * *ir£
dread of indelicate questions and offen- •
sive examinations, is removed by Dr.
Pierce's methods. Diseases of the wom-
anly organs are perfectly cured by the
use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription.
Sick women can consult Dr. R. V.
Pierce, Buffalo, N. Y., by letter free.
. "Your wonderful medicine, 'Favorite Pre-
scription,'" writes Mrs. C. N. Anderson, of Rock-
bridge Baths, Rockbridge Co., Yo , "is a God-
ftenato weak and sickly women, restoring good
bcaltb without subjecting their weak nerves to
(he shock of an examination. I was all run
down in health; could not work but a short time
without resting. Was very nervous and had a
very poor appetite, / decided to write to Dr.
Piet.t and slate my case, and am thankful that I
did, for I received a favorable reply. I took six
bottles of ' Favorite Prescription,' one of ' Gold-
en Medical Discovery," and one vial of "Pellets,*
and I can now work as well as I could before I
was taken sick. I think Dr. Pierce's medicine
the best in the world for sick and nervous

WILL ORGANIZE NEXT MONDAY.
On Monday next, January 7, the new Board of Super
visors of Amador County will hold their first meeting. The
personnel of the board will be as follows: ",_ s .
— — — „ . m * f J
M. Newman.
Every member of the board is a prominent, successful
and highly respected citizen of the county. All are men of
stamina; all have the courage ©f their convictions, and all
rank as business mtn of sound judgment. These five men
will have the welfare, to a certain extent, of Amador county
in their hands. In entering upon their respective official
duties they jointly and severally assume an important trust
one of the most important that the people of this' county can
confer upon a public official. "~
The citizens of Amador county will expect the faithful
performance of every duty entrusted to them, and each and
every one of them will be held strictly ; responsible for any
lack of faithful service. There are some changes in the ad
ministration of affairs that the people confidently expect,
and they will be dissatisfied if such changes are not speedily
The Ledger extends greeting to the incoming board
and pledges its hearty endorsement of every act of that body
so long as each act is based upon the principle of the greatest
good to the greatest number of our people, regardless "of po
litical or any other influence. The Board of Supervisors of
this or any other county, represents_ the whole people, ad
ministers for the whole people, and will be held responsible
by the whole people, and the Ledger insists that impartiali
ty, so far as possible, should obtain in each and every official
act of said board.
For many years the board has been composed of at least
three Democrats, thus giving to that party the political ad
vantage that always accompanies the majority vote. The in
coming board, however, will be exactly the reverse, three 'of
•its members being Republicans, and, of course, it is just and
right that some of the "loaves and fishes" heretofore enjoyed
by the "Democratic faithful" should be passed around to the
"Republican faithful." For instance, for "lo these many
years" the Amador "Dispatch" has been the official organ of
the Board of Supervisors, and has received a large volume of
business on that account to the exclusion of other papers in
the county. This was considered right and proper because it
was the chief organ of the party in power. At the same
time, although greatly benefited and financially strengthened
by such patronage, it does not appear that it did any more
.for the general development and upbuilding of the county
than the other papers less favored. As a matter of fact, it
was not expected to do. more. The official patronage was
simply an honor and reward conferred upon it because it was
the chief organ of the dominant party. In view of these facts,
the Ledger confidently expects to be honored and rewarded
in the same way. In short, to be made the official organ of
the new board, which has a Republican majority, just as the
"Dispatch" has been for the old board, which had a Demo
; cratic majority.j ority .
In closing, we desire to wish the members of the new
board the compliments of the season, and bespeak /or them,
one and all, a successful and pleasant term of office.

The Rational Strong Box.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury to the House of Representa
tives shows Uncle Sam well to do. The
total receipts for the fiscal year ending
June 30th were $669,595,431.18, while
the outgo from tho treasury was $590,
068,371, leaving a surplus of $79,527,
060.18. i -;-- -•>:. '
As compared with the receipts for
the preceeding year the United States
took in $58,613,426.83 more in 1900 and
the expenditures decreased $117,358, -
399.14. A pretty good showing that,
for ~ the administration of President
McKinley. *X\-t"
For the fiscal year 1901 the estimates
as officially made are: Income, all
sources, $687,773,253.92; expenditures
for the same period, $607,772,253.92, or
a surplus of $80,000,000. It is esti
mated by the Secretary of the Treas
ury that the revenues for 1902 under
existing laws will be $716,633,042. The
total estimated appropriations as sub
mitted by the several executive depart
ments, exclusive of the sinking fund,
will be $690,374,804.24, or an estimated
surplus of $26,258,237.76.
. The resources of tho treasury being
greater in 1900 than the calls and needs
of the Government, the surplus .was
largely restored to circulation by pay
ment of nearly. $10,000,000 interest in
advance of maturity, on an offer to
purchase $25,000,000 of 4 and 5 per cent
bonds of 1904-1907; nearly $20,000,000
was taken at a premium of, $2,373,502.
40; by redemption of $23,139.50 of out
standing 2 per cent. Government
bonds, and the conversion of threes,
fours and fives into the new 2 per cents,
of 1930 to the extent of $34,388,342.44,
by which the Government saved or
profited $8,685,618.
The deposits of domestic bullion at
the mints and assay, offices wore: For
the year, $203,553,813.88 in gold, and
$35,201,922.36 in silver. In the year
the coinage was: Gold, $107,937,110;
silver, $33,364,850.36, besidel 50 t OOO
Lafayette souvenir dollars. In addi
tion, at the close of the fiscal year,
there was on hand in the mints and as
say offices silver bullion for the coinage
of silver dollars 83,740,690.96 standard
ounces of the cost value of $68,224,
562.31. During tbe year the Govern
ment manufactured gold bars, $95,
267,169.02, and silver bars, $8,649,307.
14. ' The net exports of gold during
the fiscal year were $3,693,575, . against
the net imports of $51,429,099 for the
fiscal year 1899. . ;
The value of gold and silver con
sumed in the industrial arts by tbe
United States during the calendar year
1899 was: Gold, $17,847,178: silver,
coining value, $15,677,663— a total of
$33,524,841. There, was consumed in
new -material' in. the manufacture of
bars, gold, $15,112,193: silver, $13.
630,079. The amount of new material
consumed in the industrial arts in the
world was: Gold, $72,658,500, and sil
ver, coining value, $52,990,500. The
total metallic stock in the United States
on July 1, 1900, was: Gold, $1,034,
439,264; silver, $647,371,030.
. The above presentation of totals
speak to the point and ■ are emphatic
and reliable witnesses.-

A few miles from Pittsburg, Pa., a

Wheeling. W. Va., a well is 4920 feet
deep. At Spereriberg, near Berlin,
Germany, a hole in gypsum beds is
4559 feet deep. At Schladebach, near
Leipsic, salt is taken from a well 6265
feet deep. The Red Jacket shaft of the
Calumet & Hecla mine, in the Lake
Superior copper district, is a mile deep,
and men work in tho shaft. Near by,
the Tamarack mine has a shaft nearly
as deep as the Red Jacket. At Par
uschowitz, in Eastern Silesia, there is a
well 6700 feet deep. They are still bor

An Interesting Negro.
Judson W. Lyons, the Register of
the American Treasury, holds tbe most
important office ever filled by a colored
man. With Secretary Gage i and
Treasurer Roberts be forms a triumvi
rate that controls the money stock of
the republic. Not a dollar can be paid
from the Treasury without their as
sent, and the smallest greenback and
the imposing new fifty-thousand-dollar
consols alike require the name of this
interesting 1 negro to make them other
than mere paper. Of course Mr.,
Lyons can not personally sign every
note Issued by the Treasury at the
bureau of engraving and printing,
Therefore his signature is cut into the
steel dies from which the bills are
struck. It is different, however, with
the registered bonds, on which the
faith of tha gpvernment is pledged.
The register has to sigrj .each of them
by hand. This is a tremendous task,
for Mr. Lyons is often compelled to
handle near five thousand bonds a day.

Union:" , ;7j . r : ;.'??;
"It was a notable . convocation, and
its proceedings were history making.
It was composed of. representative men,
unselfishly giving their .time 'and* 'the
best product of their brains to' tho su
premest good of the entire State and of
all the people In It. They stood for
the' scholarship, the public spirit, the
productive industries, the business, the
commerce, the journalism, and the sea
and land transportation interests of the
'.The transactions of the , convention
suggest themes for debate for a year
until the commission, to be so formed
as to represent the Nation, .the State
and the association, shall have studied
and reported upon, the whole subject
of the status of tho laws relating to
forest conservation and water storage."
I ' 'No assault was made j upon Vested
Interests, and yet no concession that
these must forever, stand". in "this \way
of the supremer Interests, of V the State
and the Nation. Such conclusions' : as
were reached upon these suibjectfe^ were
mainly tentative and declaratory ' of
present belief and hope concerning' the
permanent policy th'aVm'ust be Adopt
ed." •'■' '■■-■■\ :''_'*■■ '-"^- ' : .,:-,,
'The convention realizedi' however,
that something could be donedefinitely
now, and needs to be done at' onpe. It
therefore, resolved very properly that
to carry on the work of the association
and Its examination's and surveys, there
must be Use of public moniy, hereto
fore all its outlay having been met by
private contributions. It, /therefore,
resolved to call upon Congress and the
Legislature for sufficient appropria
tions to enable the work in hand to be
actively prosecuted. It likewise agroed
upon an important measure of legisla
tion, namely, that by immediate law j a
stop shall be put to the' wasteful, care
less or wanton destruction of growing
timber." , ■ v ■.;. ..,.
"The convention realized ; that the
problems It has in hand are "if exceed
ing gravity and relate not soi much to
the present as to the future. . The State
Is to be congratulated upon the exist
ence of the association, upon the lofti
ness of its purpose, and the public spirit
of those engaged more prominently in
its promotion. ?'..-. - - ■ ..' ' .
The Twentieth Century's Dawn.
The first people to live in the twen
tieth century will be .the] Friendly
Islanders, for the date line as it may be
called lies in the Pacific ocean just to
the east of their group. At that time
although it will be already Tuesday to
them, all the rest of tho world .'will' be
enjoying some phase of Monday, the
last day of the nineteenth century (De
cember 31, 1900.) At Melbourne, Aus
tralia, people will be going to. bed, for
it will be nearly 10 o'clock; at Manila,
Philippine Islands, it will be two hours
earlier in the evening; at Calcutta, In
dia, the English residents will be sitting
at their Monday afternoon -dinner, "for
it will be 6 o'clock; and in London the
clock in the tower of the' House of
Commons will be striking the hour of
noon. In Boston, Now* York and
Washington half the people will be eat
ing breakfast on Monday morning,
while Chicago will be barely conscious
of the dawn. At the same moment San
Francisco will be in the deepest sleep of
what is popularly called Sunday night,
though really the early, dark hours of
Monday morning, and half ; of the
Pacific will be wrapped in the dark
ness of the same morning hours, which
become earlier' in the West, until at
Midway or Brooks Island it will be but
a few minutes past midnight of Sunday
night. ■ . -■ .-.."■ ■ . ' ' :•: • :■

A New Mining Enterprise
ii Near Jackson.-?
till FOUND WHILE DOING ASSESSMENT WORK
Miners' Strike in Toulumne Declared
Off.— A New Stamp-Hill for
the Rosebud.
AMADOR COUNTY.
A Hew Mining Venture.
A new mining venture is on hand just
on the edge of Jackson, which promises
to develop another producing mine,
partly within the limits of the townsite.
The property referred to is the Plem
ing, lying imnxMiately north of and ad
joining the Zeile. It was bonded two
months ago to B. A.; Ogden,, who is
also engaged in developing the Sargent
mine at Middle Bar. Mr. Ogdon took
the bond to San Francisco and found
but little difficulty in interesting cap-
ital in the undertaking. A company
under the name of the Jackson Consoli
dated Mining Co. has been organized
with the following directors: Max Gold
berg, Pres.; C. Rich, .Vice-Pries.; A. J.
• Rosborough, Sec.; E. A. Levy, W.
Geist, W. K. Slack.
The ' capitalization, as seen by the
prospectus, is for 300,000 shares of
stock, at a par value of 81 per share.
Of this amount 100,000 shares consti
tutes the treasury stock, 100,000 shares
are to be used for promotion purposes,
and 100,000 shares fur the active work
ing and development, of th<- property.
The stock in sold on the installment
plan, practically identical with that of
tho Peerless and Kirk wood, which has
been found so successful wherever tried.
Of the 100,000 offered for sale for de
- velopment purposes a large portion has
been taken already by San Francisco
people. Considering the recent issue of
the stock, about two weeks since, the
subscription is almost unprecedented.
It is probably .true that the great
Zelle vein traverses the Plemingr prop
erty from end to end. The surface in
dications are favorable, and its proxim
ity to the Zeile on the north will doubt
less give, the Pleminp an additional
value in the minds of those who remem
ber the Argonaut and Kennedy.
For the benefit of any local capitalists
who may desire to obtain stock in this
enterprise, the Ledger will state that
it may be obtained by applying to either
J. L.' Sargent at his office ou Court st.,
Jackson, or to Claude M. Smith.
Hitchell Mine— Fine Grove.
The Mitchell mine, which has re
mained idle for about 30 years, is sho w-
Intr well under the management of
Supt. L. C. Hyner. nephew of the
owner — Dr. Decker. It is a quartz
proposition. The new management
sunk a shaft north of the old works
and struck a pay shoot of ore. A ten
atamp mill is in operation.
Christenten— Volcano.
The Christensen mine, a gravel prop
osition near Volcano, is proving re
munerative to the owner as well as
those who are working it -on shares.
It is said that about $8 a day . per man
Is being taken out": : ' " . "., ';'. :■-
CALAVERAS COUNTY-
'Prospect: Thomas Dolan, who is
doing the assessment work on the
Morning Star mine in Salt Spring Val
ley, has opened up a six-foot vein of
very rich' rock. The ore carries galena
and some of the prospects dhow almost
fabulous richness. The Morning- Star
lies between the Lost Boy and Addison
mines, the property of the Buffalo
Mining Company, on the big Royal
lode. ■ The strike was made about 600
feet south of the point at which the
Buffalo Company is running a tunnel to
tap the vein on the Addison, and is a
part of the same vein. The Morning
Star is owned by Thomas Dolan, N. J.
Hart and the Dormer 8r05., . and now
becomes one of tho very promising
mince on the lode. . ■ >--■;
The shaft at the Ophir mine at Car
son is now down 320 feet and a full force
of men Is now engaged in drifting both
north and south. Some excellent rock
has been cut into this week and the
prospects in the mine look better than
ever. Superintendent Miller is now in
the city on business connected with the
mine. : ■'"!"'
Considerable difficulty has been found
in getting pipe sufficiently strong to
stand the pressure necessary in convey-
ing water to the Cross shaft. A heavy
iron' 'V,' 26 inches in diameter was pro
cured from tho city for the purpose,
but burst soon after the water was
turned on. Another one weighing 66oo
* pounds was cast at tho Altaville
foundry, but that did not stand the
pressure. Probably the next attempt
■ will be successful, I.'-, ■'■■ "; ■'■;

TUOLUMNE COUNTY
Independent: T. A. Hender has
purchased from Messrs. Birney, Wain
wright and Munroe, the fine gold
specimen which was one of the hand
somest taken out at the recent strike
in their mine, the price paid being $57.
Mother Lode: The Feciliana pros
pect recently discovered by a French
man, H. Varott, on the south side of
the Tuolumne river about 2 miles east
Qt Stevens Bar, has been bonded by a
party of Sonora men of which A. M.
Duval is at the head. The ledge is 13
feet wide showing free gold throughout
and gives every indication of being a
bananza. A force of men are now at
work developing the property. S. E.
Ball is In charge.
The mines In this vicinity are In a
most promising stage of development.
The Republican Company having fin
ished its tramway, is conveying rock
from (She mine to the ten -stamp mill on
the Mammoth property at a great sav
ing In transportation compared with
former seasons. At the Clio develop
aunt W 9rk U being carried ahead. Tbg
shaft is now nearing the 300 foot level,
and three eight hour shifts are em
ployed in this work. The Willetta,
which is destined to be one of the big
properties of this section is now ready
for the mill test which the Company
have been preparing for during the
paat month.' Oil is being used at both
the Clio and Willetta with every Indi
cation of proving an economical and
handy fuel.
Superintendent Long of the Tri Color
has matters in fine shape at this prop
erty. . They are in about 80 feet on the
ore shoot struck on the 200 level and
as there are no indications of a break
as yet be evidently has a big thing. ; A
tunnel is being run from the mill to
wards the hoist. A rock crusher will
be placed at the foot of the gallows
frame. The rock after going through
the crusher will fall into an ore bin in
the tunnel and will then be carried in a
car to the mill.
W. T. Muller, who is operating the
New Year mine on the eastern lode,
took hold of the property without any
prospect although there was . a shaft
down 300 feet. In sinking to a greater
depth, he, last week, struck a body of
Ligh grade ore on the hanging wall.
It is rumored that some parties are
trying to bond the Street mine and if
successful the mine will be reopened
next month.
The Atlas Company has several men
employed doing assessment work.
Tbo disagreement between the miners
at Big Oak Flat and their employers
has been amicably arranged, and the
men went back to work Thursday.
The strike was ordered by the Sierra
Gorda Union because of what was be
lieved by the miners to be an attempt
to cut the wages of the employes 25
cents a day on underground workers.
The trouble was at the Longfellow
and Nonpareil mines, which are owned
by the same company. The explana
tion is made by a friend of the mining
company that two young men acting as
carmen desired- to try underground
work and were accommodated. As the
men were without any . experience the
management thought it dealing very
liberally with them in paying $2.75 per
day, which is 25 cents less .than the
usual compensation. An agreement in
writing is being arranged between the
company and the men to prevent any
reduction of wages.
EL DORADO COUNTY.
Nugget: The five-stamp mill on the
St. Clair mine was completed last
Thursday and the stamps set in motion.'
Wm. Spargo and W. Roberts i are the
mill men. The mine has every appear
ance of proving a fine piece of property.
The test run at the Gopher-Boulder
mine, near Kelsey, was completed yes
terday and a clean up is ' being made
today. 7': vr
It is said that the Eureka Slate Com
pany have been having surveys made
lately and contemplate the building of
a wagon road down through Kelsey
Canyon to connect with the County
road at Chili Bar bridge or will con
struct an electric railroad to convey
the product of their quarries to' the
railroad depot at Placerville.
It is reported that M. L. Smith has
purchased a five-stamp mill near Mos
quito and will move it to the Rosebud
mine, near Fairpiay. It is also stated
that a steam drill will be operated on
the Rosebud property.

Followed By A Lion.
[ . About 3 o'clock on Monday morning,
Dec. . 24th, Willis E. Hoss -left his
father's ranch, 'in Antelope, district,
with a load of potatoes which he was to
deliver to a purchaser in Jackson.' He
had proceeded about five or six miles,
when, the road being so rough and the
morning so dark, be decided to halt
until daylight. During the stop he fell
into a slight dose from which he was
aroused by a succession of blood
curdling screams from a mountain lion.
He whipped up his team and got out
of that locality as soon as possible, but
the lion followed him for several miles
making the morning ring with his
frightful yelps. At one time, ,_the lion
came up abreast of the team, at a short
distance to one side, and uttered a
number of screams, but he approached
no nearer. Young Hqss says he' wants
no more company of that kind through
the woods on a dark morning. .

late James Smith, and is a sister-in-law
of Charles Smith of Sutter Creek. Her
only son, Thpmas Jf.f is a noted ex

day of next month, he will bo ninety
seven years old. He was born in the
state of New York pn February 25,
1804: His mind is as plear as it ever
was, and his memory of recent events,
as well as those of the long ago, is re
markably good. Every week he walks
to the barbershop to get shaved, and
is as slick and tasty in his dress as
ever. This winter, ho, weyer, he has
not been quite as string as usual, but,
on the whflle, is in remarkable health
for one of his age.
A Wean Trick.
A farmer in Angels tpwnship played
a mean triok on a Copperopblis hunter
last week. The granger had killed a
squirrel, skinned him and stuffed his
hide with leaves, then climbed a tall
tree and nailed the dummy to a limb.
Soon a hunter came along and spied
the squirrel. The hunter S&P,t at the
squirrel until his ammunitipn was all
gone and his gun-barrel hot enough to
fry spit. He then climbed the tree
and discovered the deception and then
he was bo hot that he burned a hole in
his pants sliding down. But he did not
take the bait down. He just left it
there for some other fool hunter to
shoot at. — Citizen.

STANDARD ELECTRIC COMPANY GAMP REIOVED
The Bucket and Cable Farted in the

one Was Injured.
Skagway, Alaska, Dec. 15, 1900.
Dear Ledger:
. Election being a thing of the
past, I wish to say a little about the
conditions, under which this thinly
settled, Isolated but rich' region, is
struggling toward the .position it de
serves as part of a great nation. And
no party has any* right to accuse the
other on this subject, for both have
covered themselves with discredit . in
their management of Alaskan affairs
for more than 30 years. . i >
Instead of encouraging and assisting
the hardy pioneers who were braving
hardships unknown to those who j went
to California 50 years ago, the Govern
ment has treated them more like the
people of a conquered province, Indeed
far worse than it treated the men who
surrendered their arms at Appomattox.
The officers are appointed from Wash
ington as personal favors to the ap
pointees without regard to their fitness
or the wishes of the people. For in
stance, last spring a practically ' unani
mous request was sent to President
McKinley from the Republicans of
Alaska that Governor Brady should
hold his office no longer. .'By return
mail came Gov. Brady's re-appoint
ment for two years. Petitions for a
Territorial form of government are
not even replied to. Another abuse
most maddening to the sons' ■ of those
who fought in '76, is the oppressive
taxation without representation,
carried on all over Alaska. Last year
Skagway alone paid nearly forty thou
sand dollars In taxes to the TJ. S., a
thing unheard of since the thirteen
colonies risked everything in a seven
years war rather than submit to such
tyranny. Had England succeeded in
collecting all the taxes sho tried to
exact in 1770, the amount would have
been less than Alaskans are paying
now. A ' few blocks from j here,' a
woman who ' was supporting her four
children, all under ten years, by taking
boarders, had to take down her sign
because she was unable to pay the fifty
dollar tax our great free government
exacts from all who feed the hungry In
this Arctic region where all eatables
except fish and game, have to, be
brought a thousand miles or more.
This year some of the best mining -dis
tricts have been given a disastrous set
back by the power-of -attorney loca
tions now held to be legal, Instead of
allowing each district to manage its
: own affairs as in early days in Cali
fornia. At Nome one man located
more than eight hundred claims of 20
acres each, none of which were worked
and nobody can touch them until Jan.
1, 1902. Such wholesale tying-up of
claims was the main cause of the slow
development of Nome and other places.
The Porcupine district, less than
fifty miles west of here, promises to be
very rich, but most qf that has been
given over to Canada through the
shrewdness -of ' Brstish diplomacy,
which has cut the thirty-three mile
atrip the U. S,. bought frpm Russia,
down to less than eight and thus gives
England , more than two thousand
sqnare miles of rich territory for two
years with the advantage that possess
ions always carries. A Canadian Cus
tom House stands, at the. water front
in Skagway and the officials take.no
; pains to conceal their contempt for the
weakness of Uncle San) in allowing
such infringement. ' An American doc
tor or lawyer Is not allowed to practice
in Canada but Canadians or any one
else may freely practice here and these
facts are often quoted as evidence of
Inferiority of American Institutions.
(Can this be the case?)"
The past season several prominent
officials were in Skagway and when
their attention was called to, these
abuses they, prqruised to, use their in

Two ships have been wrecked be

Ing. A cable between the . Pacific
Coast and the Philippines is a necessity.
The distance from San Francisco by
the Sandwich Islands and Guam is
much greater than Seattle, touching
several points alonj* the cpast qf Alaska
Russia, Japan and Ch,ina. To, prove
this take a globe and a string and see
for yourself. The Alaskan route would
also have the advantage qf shorter
spans so that a smaller cable would be
sufficient, the expense would be much
less, and the local traffic and strategic
importance would be great advantages.
The promoters of the Sandwich Island
route ask a subsidy of ($400,000) four
hundred thousand dollars yearly, those
of the Alaskan rqute ask no subsidy at
all, but simply the government pat
ronage. The subsidy ltotn accounts
for the milk in. the epeqanut. and the
"push" & straining every effort to
crowd the job through before the sub
ject is fully understood by the country
In general. Watch and see if they suc
ceed. I believe that Is all I have to

Preacher Defends Lynching.
At the weekly meeting In Chicago
last Monday of the Methodist ministers
of the city, Rev. W. B. Leach, of
Wicker Park, .caused a sensation by
defending the recent lynching of a
negro, Preston Porter, of Colorado.
Resolutions denouncing the lynching
were under discussion when Dr. Leach,
after reviewing the affair, said:
"If such a deed were committed on a
member of my family I would be tho
first to apply the torch. " ■
Hisses, long and loud, greeted this
statement. Several ministers sprang
to their feet to reply. ■ .
Rev. Mr. . Level declared the min
ister's remarks did not surprise him,
for he had heard Mr. Leach utter simi
lar sentiments several years ago. Rev.
Mr. Crawford declared that if such
sentiments were circulated by the pul
pit there would be no laws; that ■ min
isters had no right to condemn Judges
and juries if they themselves did not

It Into a Comedy.
"One of the most laughable sc«".v>* I
ever witnessed during the repre^-i:;.)
tion of one of Shakespeare's tt£x*
dies," said a well known theatrical
manager to the writer the other day.
"happened to the late Tom Keene
when he was performing in a northern
New, York town. The company was
playing 'Julius Caesar,' and at the
last moment It was found that the
property man had failed to send up the
regular throne chair used in the sen
ate scene, and an old rustic chair was
hastily procured from the left of the
theater and, after being covered with
draping, was pressed Into service. In
the midst of the scene a large wasps'
nest was discovered attached to the
chair, and its . Inhabitants, becoming
indignant at the disturbance they I had
suffered, began to swarm about: the
stage, seeking revenge upon the Ro
mans in . their low necked and short
sleeved dresses. The wasps seemed to
be particularly offended with Caesar,
and It is doubtful if Caesar's death
scene was ever acted with more feel
ing, for at the moment be was being
pierced by the conspirators' daggers
the wasps were most Industrious in
their work. '
"In the tent scene where Caesar ap
pears to Brutus one might almost have
doubted Its being the real Caesar. It
was the same In form and dress, j but
the face was no longer the same. In
the last act Brutus had one eye closed,
Antony a swollen lip. Casslus an en
larged chin, Lucius an inequality In
the size of bis hands and Octavius
Ca?sar . a nose that would have done
service as the famous nasal organ of
Bardolf In -Henry IV.'
"The tragedy came very near. becom
ing a roaring comedy when Mr. Keene,
as Cassius. said. 'Antony, the posture
of your blows Is yet unknown but for
your words; they rob the Hybla bees
and leave them honeyless,' and the
actor who was doing Antony replied,
'Not stingless too.' "—Washington Star.
A Cnrlona Combat.
■- <-A traveler In South Africa •witnessed
. . not long since a singular combat ]He
, was musing one morning, with his eyes
on the "ground, when he noticed a cat
erpillar crawling along at a rapid rate.
Pursuing him was a host of small
r ' black ants.
Being quicker In tbelr movements,
[ the ants would catch up with the cater
pillar, and one .would mount his hack
; and bite him. Pausing, the caterpillar
would turn his head and bite and kill
his tormentor. , After slaughtering a
dozen or more of his persecutors ,the
caterpillar : showed signs of fatigue.
The ants made a combined attack. 'Be
taking himself to a stalk of grass, the
, caterpillar climbed up the tree tail first
I followed by the ants. As one approach
i ed he seized it in his Jaws and threw it
"off the stalk.
The ants, seeing that the caterpillar
had too strong a position for them to
overcome, resortefl to strategy. They
began sawing through 'the grass stalk.
In a few minutes the stalk fell, and
hundreds of ants pounced ! upon the
fallen caterpillar. He was killed at
once, and the victors marched off In
great triumph, leaving the foe's body

Forrest aa a Negro Hlnatrat.
From almost the beginning of Ameri
can stage history there were negroes ol
the minstrel variety Impersonated on
the stage, though it was not until aboul
1840 that thny were organized Into
bands. Some of the greatest actors ol
later days had their experience as min
strels, , among them; Joe Jefferson and
Edwin Forrest
Forrest was given a negro "song and
dance" v act to do when he # was very
young, and after he had studied It up
he asked where' was the '"old negro
lady" that was to act his assistant In
the piece. The management tried sev
eral of the, women who were members
of. the company, but none of them
would consent to blacken up, and, In
fact, they were very Indignant over the
proposition. The actor, however, was
not easily discouraged, and on the
night of the first performance he black
ened up and went around the corner to
an old negro woman who did his wash
ing.
"Hello, Dinah," he said on entering.
"How yo' be er feelin dis bery fine
ebenin?"
"Hello, yo'." replied the African lady.
* 'Pears to me yo' am er bery fresh nig
ger." .
"I'ze no nigger," answered Forrest
and then, time being rather short, be
assumed his natural voice and told Di
nah, much to ber surprise, tbat he was
Forrest the actor, and tbat he wanted
her to go on the stage with him that
night and laugh loudly at frequent In
tervals, which was all the female part
called for. The two made a great hit
and were kept on for some time, which
goes to show that Forrest might have
been a good minstrel had he been of an
ambitious nature.— Saturday Evening

Olive oil should be found In every

In time of croup It can be given fre

effective In building up the system and

who was once a leading merchant
there. In the early days of the city
he walked Its streets, out of work and
money. He was poorly clad, but neat
and clean. He sought employment
from a prosperous grocer and said he
was willing to do anything. The mer
chant at length sent him Into his cel
lar to clean out a room so foully dirty
that many a common laborer had re
fused to enter it When the young
man appeared in the evening, he was
as neat in his appearance as be had
been In the morning. Of course the
merchant thought be bad done little or
nothing. But when he saw the cellar,
clean and fresh, he said to the young
man:
"You've not only shown that you are
willing to work, but also that you have
some respect for yourself. I guess I'll
give you a Job."

BEST GAMBLING SYSTEM.
The One That Will Snrely Beat Faro
and Roulette.
"Every confirmed gambler In the
world has spent more or less time try-
Ing to figure out some system to beat
the game," said a well known northern
sporting man. "The commonest and
most plausible scheme is the one known
as 'progression.' It is simply a dou
bling of bets until a winning occurs,
and theoretically It Is perfect but the
trouble Is tbat ail gambling games
have a limit and the doubling process
Increases n wager with such enqrmous
rapidity tbat It is apt to get over the
stipulated amount before the winning
takes place. ■ :
"I was at Monte Carlo last spring."
continued the speaker, "and was sur
prised at the number of touts who in
fested the grounds peddling 'sure
thing' systems to break the bank. The
ludicrous part of It was that most of
the peddlers were seedy and poverty
stricken In appearance, yet they pur
ported to sell secrets which would in
fallibly enrich any purchaser. I asked
one, fellow. why he didn't try his sys
tem himself and buy a new bat and
he replied very glibly that he was
'working for a syndicate! and under
bonds not to play.
"Nearly all of these systems are
based on progression and would be im
possible In high play owing to the ca
sino limit - Nevertheless I saw a num
ber of small progression players at the
tables and was told that they have
been a fixture there for many years.
They were nearly all horrible. looking,
bloodless old women, who began with
the smallest possible wager and quit
when they won 20 francs, or less than
$4. - A house official Informed me tbat
they were tolerated about the place on
account of age and Infirmity and tbat
their daily winnings. were regarded In
the light of a pension.
"In the days of open gambling In
New Orleans I remember there used
to be several broken down sports who
were said to make a living off the
games by 'progression playing.' I have
my doubts about It, however. The
best system and the only system tbat
will beat faro and roulette is to stay
away." — New Orleans Times-Demo

A Jamaican Experience.
For some years after my marriage I
lived at Old Harbor, a small place
about 20 ' miles from Kingston. One
day when a visit to my Kingston dress
maker was a necessity I ordered a
young negro boy to get upon the rum
ble and drive me to the town.
I paid my visit to the dressmaker,
and, receiving my frock, a light sum
mer thing, from her, I placed It In the
box beneath the buggy seat and drove
on to my sister's, where I went in to
escape the heated part of the day, giv
ing my boy sixpence and bidding him
see the sights and return at 4 o'clock.
He turned up punctually, with the
grin still on his face, and in due time
we reached Old Harbor once more.
- When I went to take out my crispy
muslin, I found, to my consternation, it
was a wet, sloppy mass. No rain had
fallen, and even then— .
I turned to the boy: "Solomon, what
In the world does this mean? How"—
But the look of utter helpless amaze

The steelmaker wanted to ask a

The lawyer said he had an Important

conld not get away.
"Come over now, then," Mr. Carnegie
said.
"Can't get train," answered the law

"Hire a special," was the answer
which came back from Pittsburg.
So the lawyer engaged a special
train, went to Pittsburg and saw Mr.
Carnegie. !
The steelmaker asked the lawyer's
advice as to whether the question trou
bling him called for "yes" or "no."
The lawyer answered, "No."
"Thank you," said Mr. Carnegie.
"Good night."

The Unique Horn of the Unicorn.
The horn of a unicorn was shown at
Windsor castle and In 1508 was valued
at over £10,000. Lewis Vertomannus,"
a gentleman of Rome,' saw with his
own eyes two unicorns presented to the
sultan of Mecca by a king of Ethiopia.
They were in a park of the temple of
Mecca and were not much unlike a colt
of 30 months of age. This was In 1503.
The animal became extinct about the
end of the seventeenth century.
The unicorn is represented in the
ruins at Pprsepolis, and It was adopted
by the Persians as the emblem of speed
and strength. In the middle ages It
was the symbol of purity. The unicorn
hated the elephant, and it used to whet
Its horn on a stone before it struck the
foe In the abdomen. No family, by the
way, should be without one of these
horns, the average length of which is
four feet. They defend from witch
craft Thus Torquemada had one al
ways on his writing table. Further
more, a drinking cup made from one
will be a safeguard against poison, as
will the ground powder put in drink,
and Indeed the wells of the palace of
St. Mark could not be poisoned in the
good old days of adventure because
these - beneficent horns - had ■■' been
thrown Into them. Unicorn's horn was
formerly sold by apothecaries at $120

No Uae For the Water.
"They tell a good many Jokes about

Her Sacrifice.
The Rev. Cyrus T. Brady says In his
book of missionary reminiscences: "I
was once preaching about missions,
urging the congregation to make some
sacrifice for the missionary cause and

which they could follow my advice.
Among other things I suggested that
they refrain from purchasing any book
which they very much desired and do
nate the money to me Instead for my
missionary work. . I. happened to hove
perpetrated a book myself.
"You will therefore understand my
feelings when a very bright woman in
the congregation came up to me and
handed me $1 with the remark, I had
Intended to buy your book and read it,
Mr. Brady, but I have concluded to fol
low your advice and give you the mon
ey for missions instead.'
"I accepted the situation gracefully
and told her I would lend ber my own
copy of the book to read. She smiled
and thanked me, and as she did so I
voiced my thought In this way, 'But
after all Mrs. R., there does not seem
to be any sacrifice on your part in this
transaction, for you have the happy
consciousness of having given the mon
ey for missions and yet have the book
as well.'

my tip, he grew serious.

presidential election,' he said, Trat re

Fat Policemen.
"Have you ever noticed that nearly
all policemen get fat?" asked a man
who keeps his eyes open. "This would
seem to disprove the theory that walk-
Ing in the open air is a means of reduc
ing superfluous weight I have known
new policemen to start on their beats
weighing no more than 125 pounds. In
six months they would tip the scales at
150 and in a year reach the 200 mark.
It must be the slow sauntering In' the
open nir that does It, for I have noticed
that while policemen grow fat 1 the
house sergeants, who are confined to
the stations, are Invariably thin. Those
who patrol the streets gain the maxi
mum weight in about three years. The
muscles then harden, and despite their
apparent burden of flesh the men usu
ally develop great activity. One of the
best runners and jumpers I know Is a
policeman who weighs nearly . ■ 300
pounds."— Philadelphia Record. . '

Bark.
Now a large, dark vessel was ■ de
scried In .the Bosporus, belching fire
and waking the echoes of those histor
ic shores with the thunder of her guns.
"What bark is that?' asked the sul
tan.
"That, I take It, »s the bark of the
dogs of war." said the grand vizier wit
tily. .
This sally was followed by a strict
party laugh, the opposition groaning.—

Appropriate Shades.
A party of Americans were sitting
on the upper deck of a Rhine river boat
enjoying the charming scenery. One
was reading aloud from a guidebook
about the various castles as they came
Into view. Just as the boat was pass
ing one of the finest old buildings a
woman In the party exclaimed to ber
companions: "Why, that old castle Is
Inhabited. See, there are blinds at the
windows."
"No," said a man standing by her
Bide; "those are the shades of their an
cestors."
