The size, of the_heart in different
animals is found by Prof. Hesse to
vary with the activity of the chemical
changes that supply, the body with
nutrition and remove waste, it is
largest in birds, .. is larger among
young warm-blooded animals than in
the mature, and is very small in
sluggish cold-blooded creatures.
Stated in thousandths of the body
weight, the highest relative heart
weigth is 24. 1, that of" the sandpiper,
while among mammals the highest is
11.4 in a dwarf bat. Among fishes
the relative heart weight of a member
of the mackerel family is as high as
2.1, but the smallest relative heart
weights known are 0.15 and 032., in
Sphageobranchus and Ophisurus, two
eel-like sand fishes. The relative
heart weight ot a young Greenland
whale was 5.7, equal to that of tho
camel, man and the mole. ' The re
lative heart weight of the blind worm
is l.b; water frog 1.9; toad, 3.2.
The illuminating engineer is a sci
entific specialist whose early appear
ance is predicted by L. Uastor, an
English electrician. The production
of artificial light is wasteful, and
much of the light produced is lost —
often one-half^or even two-thirds— by
improper placing, reflecting and shad
ing. It is asserted that better illumi
nation could be given, with a. saving
of at least ten per cent of the 8180,
000,000 annually spent for lighting in

in a research to determine accur
ately the effect of sunlight on germs,
Dr. K. Wiesner, a German bacteri
ologist, has made some important dis
coveries. He has found that the dis
ease germs and harmless parasites of
men and animals are weakened or
killed on exposure to sunlight, while
open-air bacteria are little affected;
also that disease germs do not lose
their virulenco until their dead
bodies are entirely destroyed. Ultra
red rays, like the ultra-violet, havo
especially powerful germicidal effect,
■.'he action of sunlight is in direct
proportion to its intensity, varies
with season and time of day, and is
lessened by moisture and cold, but at
midday during half of tho year it
seems to be sufficient to destroy most
bacteria in two or three hours. Pneu
monia, bronchitis and "colds" in
general are probably diminished in
summer by the greater power of sun
light. Diffused in houses, the sun's
rays are enormously reduced in in
tensity and they lose all disinfective
power. '.-;■
A curious mishap has. given us a
very delicate test for hydrochloric
acid in tho atmosphere. In a north
of England locality many houses nave
curtains of the cream color produced
by metanil yellow— popularly known
as "dolly" cream dye, and to science
as "the sodium salt of meta-amido
benzene sulphonic acid-azo-diphenyl
auilne." Some of those cream-colored
curtains suddenly changed to helio
trope. Investigation showed that an
accidental escape of hydrochloric acid
from a neighboring alkali plant had
discolored the curtains, and the dyo
became a most useful test.
A new safeguard for collieries is

Iron being the most abundant metal
of the basic rocks and constituting
nearly five per cent of the earth's
crust, it is difficult to realize how
rapidly the supply contained in the
ores now smelted is being exhausted.
Mr liennett 11. lirougb, in his iiritish
Association paper pointed out that
every inhabitant of the United States,
the United Kingdom and Germany
requires about a quarter of a ton of
iron yearly, in 1905 the world pro
duced a total of 60,000,000 tons from
120, 000, 000, tons of ore, the production
of Great Uritaiu having been 14,590,
703 tons, while that of the United
States exceeded 42,500,0u0 tons, the
highest output ever recorded. The
woild's known supply of iron ore yet
to be mined is estimated at 10,000,
000,000 tons. Of this Germany has
2,200 million tons; Frauce, 1,500
millions; Kussia, 1,500 millions; the
United States, 1,100 millions; Great
britain 1,000 millions; Spain, 500
millions, and the rest belongs to the
non-producing countries. There are
still enormous stores of unknown ex
tent in Australia, South Africa and
elsewhere. Ere these are exhausted,

AN OLD TEAMSTER
INSTANTLY KILLED,
Henry Dorray Found Dead on the
West Point Road.
The Calaveras Chronicle gives the
following concerning the accidental
death of Henry Dorray:
Wednesday last a fatal accident
happened on the West Point road,
about three and " a ' half miles frem
this place by which Henry' Dorray, an
old and respected citizen of Hich
Ijiulcb, was instantly killed. The
-particulars of the sad affair are "as
follows:
About six o'clock on the morning
of tho accident Mr Dorray left his
ranch near Kich Gulch driving a6
horse team loaded with logs for the
Gwin mine. A little after seven
o'clock the driver of the West Point
stage John Sterling, and his passenger
John Cook, met Dorray 's team about
half way up the Lancell grade,' which
was over two miles -from the sceno of
the accidont, without a driver. Mr
Cook at once jumped out of the stage
and stopped the team while Mr Ster
ling went ou with the stage. About
1 mile from Mineral station, Sterling
discovered Dorray lying in the mid
dle of the road. He called to him a
couple of times and recoiving no
answer he whipped up his team and
started for Kich Uulch, a distance of
two miles, where upon his arrival he
told J. P. MoTernan, the proprietor
of thehotel, that he believed Henry
Dorray was lying dead in the road.
A number of men at oucojtarted out
but in the meantime Juhn Cook had
taken his saddle horse, which he had
hitched behind the stage, and started
back to find Dorray, whom he be-
Jieved had met with somo accident,
aad when the men from Kich (Julch
arrived John was standing guard over
the body. Tho unfortunate man was
lying on his left side, with his head
down hill aud -his legs drawa . up
nearly to his chin. An examination'
of the body was made when it was
discovered that the left ear was
nearly severed from the head and
that tbo left 'tomplo was crushed in
and there was also a sevore bruiso on
the left shoulder. It is believed that
the unfortunate man was suddenly
seized with a fainting spell and fell
from the wagon to the ground, and
that the hind wheel of the vehicle
crushed in the temple. Acting
coroner Hurco held an inquest aud
the jury after hearing the evidence
adduced rendered a verdict of acci
dental death. ',
The remains were removed to the
family residence near Kich Gulch
from which place the funeral services
were held Fi iday last, and the re
mains interred in the family plot on
the rauch, Key. l-'rank Z. Twole.
officiating, aud the funeral was large
ly attended.
The deceased was an old resident of
Kich Gulch, having resided in that
immediate vicinity for ' the past
thirty year 3. A hard working man,
honest and upright in his dealings, a
good citizen, a kind neighbor and an
indulgent lather, he will be missed
from tho daily walks of life by a
large circle of friends. The deceased
was a native of Massachusetts and at
the time of his death was 6:2 years of
Hge.
He leaves to mourn his untimely
death a bereaved wife, three sons and
five daughters and to ' whom the
sympathy of the ontire community is
extended in this their hour of sorrow.

Origin of Yankee Doodle.
There has beon much discussion on
the origin of Yankee Doodle without
fiixng it with entire certainty. The
air can be traced back in England, it
is said, to the time of Charles T., and
the doggerol verses that are sometimes
sung to it are said to be 'nearly as
old. In the old English song the
name used was "Nankee Doodle,"
and it is said that this name was ap
plied in derision to Oliver Cromwell.
Nowjmtiquarians claim that the word
"Yankee" was derived from the
Indian pronunciation of the the word
"English," which they called "l'eng
hees," but that the English soldiers
in the French and Indian war applied
it to the colonials in derision. What
is known as the original "Yankee
boodle" song beginning with the
words :
Father and 1 went down to camp,
Along with Capt. Goodwin,
And there we saw the men and boys
As thick as hasty puddin'— '
was written by a British officer while
his army was yet in Boston in the
summer of 1775. The word Yankee
does not occur in these verses, but
they were sung to the tune known as
"Yankee Doodle." Now, as to the
tune. It is identical with the air
known in both England and America
long before the revolution as "Lydia
Fisher's Jig," to which the words of
an old nursery song were adapted :
Lucy Locket lost her pocket,
Lyddy Fisher found it; -
Not a bit of money in it,
Only binding around it.
In 1770,> when the colonial troops
joined tho British regulars under
Gen. Johnson near Albany, prepara
tory to their attack on the French
post at Niagara, a British surgeon,
who was a clever musician and some
thing of a wit besides, arranged this
old air and commended it to the
officers of the provincial militia as a
well-known piece of military music.
The joke was successful, the air
pleased the soldiers greatly and bo
came very popular iv the Colonial
army, says the Housekeeper. This
was unquestionably the incident that
made "Yankee Doodle" our national
air. A far more remote origin, of
this air has also beon claimed.
Kossath, whon in the United States,
said that tho Hungarian distinctly
reconsized tho tune of "Yankee
Doodle" as an old national dance of
their own. A Spanish professor of
music has also identified it as the
ancient sword dance of tho biscayans,
and a German has declared it to bo
an air traditionally known in his
country. Dr. Uombaugh, antiquarian
and literaiy student, asserts that both

Moving Slowly.
The agitation of the gcafting that
has been, and still is, in progress in
connectiun with our county govern
ment, is not, as perhaps many may
be led to think from superficial
acquaintance, without result. The
leaven is working slowly, but surely.
It requires time to break up customs
• which have been tolerated for long
years. Those who are interested iv
the continuance of illegal methods
will use their utmost endeavors to
maintain the statu quo. .Neverthe
le.-is, in spite of all adverse influences,
the system is crumbling in the glare
of the publicity that has been thrown
upon it through the columns of the
Ledger for several . mouths past. In
proof of this we call attention to the
following facts:
Ist. The method of ordering blank
books for county officers has been
moditiiid. It will be noticed, from
the minutes of- the. board of super
visors that-bflls for blank books and
stationery from the wholesalo houses
of tho city have disappeared. The
custom which prevailed before the
Ledger's agitation was for eanh
« county officer to order direct from
the city supply houses, and the firm
furnishing the supplies would then
send in the bill for the same direct
to the board. This was in . the
absence of any contract with the
lowest bidder, or rate established by
the board, as the law expressly pro
vides. The firms were left, to charge
their own prices, and the door was
thrown - open for abuses. it is a
. pretty safe conclusion that where the
| opportunity is given, and maintained
for a long series of years, abuses
. will almost invariably creep iv. The
invitation in that direction is rarely
unaccepted.
In the bills pro&ented and allowed
by the board last month, the San
Francisco blank book manufacturers
have no standing. The orders for
these supplies were given to local
"~ dealers. These local dealers get the
supplies from the city houses, and
are allowed a commission— usually
from 15 to i! 0 per cent -from regular
rates. Thus, the county pays no
more than under the former system,
but the local business men reap the
benefit of the commission; whereas,
formerly, either the wholesale houses
pocketed the whole thing, or. some
one got the commission who had not
the shadow of right to it.
* Last month the items of blank
books amounted to about 8100, divid
ed between two local dealers, Vela &
}Piccardo and the City Pharmacy.
These two firms were benelitted to
the extent of about §20. These items
amounted to three or four times as
much as all other stationery items
combined. "While this plan of order
ing is infinitely preferable to that
heretofore in vogue, it has no legal
basis. Tho bills presented in this
way are still open to the charge ot
illegality. The law requires thai
such supplies be contracted for
annually with the lowest bidder, and
the printing rates established annual
ly. The Ledger does not propose to
stop in this work at the half-way
station. We are pleased to announce
that a vitally important point has
been gained, but the end is not yet.
. Another notable improvement is
noticed in the stationery bill. Last
month, after a careful comparison
with the schedule, we detected but,
one slight departure from- the con
tract rates. This was a charge of SI
for a Smith-Premier ribbon, wherea?
the contract price is 70c. This is an
important gain on the record cf the
past. It is conclusive that the ex
posures of the Ledger are having t
salutary effect, notwithstanding the
apparent indifference of the super
visors in regard to this vital subject.
It is public opinion that is forcing
the issue, and slowly compelling
obedience to legal provisions and the
solemn obligations of a contract.
Russell Estate Contest.
The probate case of J. A; Orchisor
vs. G. M. Huberty, public adminis
trator, was decided by Judge Kust
last week. Wo give herewith the full
text of the decision, which denies the
legal right of Elizabeth Jane Symons.
—who claims to be a daughter of tut
deceased, and the claim stands undis
puted,—to act as administratrix her
self, or to nominate an administrator.
The basis of the refusal is that she
is not, and was not at the time oi
nominating Orchison as adminis
trator, a bona fide resident of Cali
fornia. She was an actual resident
of this state; came out from EnglaDd
no doubt mainly for the purpose of
looking after her interests in thf
estate. The public administrator iv
the meantime had been granted
letters of administrator, and the con
test arose as to which of the twe
possessed the legal right to conduct
the affairs of the estate under th<
circumstances. The court decided
in favor of the official. The full text
will be found in another column.

form their functions properly, the
secretions being unnatural and the
passages too frequent, greatly dis
turbing my rest at night. 1 used
many remedies but did not succeed
in finding relief until I heard of
Uoan's Kidney PiJla and procured a
box. They gave mo such relii-f in a
short time that 1 continued their use
and received a cure. I was seveuty
t'our years old at the time this cure
took place and 1 think this is even
more reason that 1 should consider
Doan's Kidney Pills a marvelous
remedy."

Monument Unveiled.
Sunday afternoon the monument
placed over the'grave of Tina L. Kauo
was unveiled by Ursula Parlor No. 1,
N. U. G. W. with mo3t impressive
exercises. ' About two o'clock the
Native Dauhgters formed iv front of
the lodgo room, and matched slowly
to tho cemotery to the beat of rnuliled
drums. In a few words Lenu Burgin,
president of Ursula Parlor, stated
that they had assemblod to do honor
to the memory of Tina L. Kune, past
grand president of the Native Daugh
ters, and to unveil tho monument
placed over her grave by tho order.
Following a chorus by tho ladies, and
prayer by Mary Dempsey, grand trea
surer. Emma G. l''ol«y, grand presi
dent, spoke of the great work deceas
ed had done na a member ot the
Native Daughters," and how much her
kind words and counsel were missed
by her friends. Sho then removed
the American ilag with whjch the
monument had been draped.
In eulogy, Hon. K. C. Kust touched
upon her life in general and her
character in particular, lie 6ald that
she was always a very earnest worker,
devoting most of her timo^to the
betterment of others, as a lodge mem
bor and as a teacher, in tho public
schools, and that sbo had passed to
the great beyond to prepare a paiior:
where there would be no parting.
Tho first parlor of .Native Daughters
was founded in Jackson September 0,
18PC, and Tina L. Kane was tne first
grand president, being oleeted in San
Francisco shortly after and held offioo
for one year. She lived in Jackson
the greator part of her life, teaching
school here up to the time of the
death of her parents, when she went
to Ventura and taught school for six
years up to the time of her death on
October 25, l'JOl. At that time Ella
E. Camiuctti was grand president of
the order, so she immediately • ap
pointed as a committee, ■ Anna Mo-
Laughliu, Dooley Sanguinetti, Carrie
Tifiauy and Teresa Muldoon, with
herself as chairman, ; to arrange for a
monument to bo placed over tho grave
of their dead sister. The dedication
Sunday was the result of their efforts.
A Pioneer Passes Away.
Thomas Dennis Madden'one of tho
pioneer settlers of the state passe"d
away Wednesday evening about live
o'clock at the home of his son Thos.,
at tho .New York JKeservoir. His
health had been failing for several
years so that his death did not come
as a very groat surprise to his re
latives and friends. . He leaves throe
sons, John L., Thomas and Dennis to
mourn his domise.
The deceased was a ' native of J re
land, born in 181!9, coming to this
country when quite a boy. The Cali
fornia fever took him, as it did with
many others, and he came to this
state in 1852, and mined all through
th's section, particularly iv Calaveras
county. About forty years ago ho
settled 1u Amador county and has
remained here practically ever siuce.
For many yoars he was ditch tender
for" the Amador Canal Company, con
tinuiug in that service until the iu
crcasing infirmities of age rendered
him incapable of attending to the
arduous duties in connection there
with.
Decoased was highly respected by
all who were acquainted with him.
He was a man of strict integrity, up
right in all his dealings. His wife
died some years ago, also a married
daughter, Mrs Emma Daughorty.
He was a mom her of Jackson Lodge
A.'O.-U. W., and carried an insur
ance of S2OOO, in that order. Tho
funeral will' take place to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock, interment in
the Catholic cemetery.
Sale of the McCutchen Store.
The stock of boots, shoes and
goueral dry goods, belonging to the
bankrupt estate of J. McCutcheu,
took place before th 9 referee, Chas'A.
Bliss, in Sacramento ou Saturday
last. From Jackson thore were pre
sent U. S. Cregory,' the trustee, and
W. G. Sriyder, the latter representing
K. Webb, the heaviest creditor. It
was expected that the examination of
the bankrupt would be taken up on
that day but this matter was postpon
ed until the 15th of October. At the
time for opening the sealed bids for
the purchase of the stock, no bids
had been put in. Several • parties
wore in attendance, however, for tho
purpose of bidding. Finally a sealed
proposal was put in otl'oriupr to puf
chase the stock at 87,0G0. This v.-as
only a trifle over 50 cents ou tho ap
praised value under the second ap
praisement, which was calculatod at
75 per cent of the original appraise
ment, or cost prino. Dealers who
make a business of buying up bank
rupt estates of this character were
there, and there seemed an under
standing among them to get th 9 pro
perty as low as possible. Attorney
Snyder, however, was prepared to bid
outside of any combination, for the
sole purpose of seeing that the goods
were not sacrificed. The bidding
soon simmcreil down between Suydor
and Mr Gollober of San Francicso. It
was run up from S7UOO to ?yOSO, at
which sum it was finally sold to
iiollober. Them is no doubt that the
presence 61 Mr Snyder was tho means
of saving tho estate over 82000.
S. Wollf, representing the Gollober
Syndicate, arrived in Jackson Mon
day evening. lie will go over the
stock to S9O that it coiresponds with
the inventory.
The checkiug up of the stock was
completed yesterday. It was all gone
over carefully by S. Wolf, represent
ing the purchaser, and J. L. Glaviuo
vich for the trustee. It was found to
tally with the invoice "within 610, and
rather than go over it again, tho pur
chaser concluded to take it at the
invoice list. Tho stock was formally
released by the trustee to Mr Gollaber
to-day. Iv another column it is
offered for sale to tho merchants of
Amador county. In rase it cannot
be disposed of in that way, it will be
sold at retail, due notice of which
will be given hersafter.

Teachers' Institute.
Tho next Amador toaehors' in
stituto will be . held iv .Sacramento
somotimo this month. Superintend
ent Greeuhalgh has decided to hold it
iv tho capital city for good and
sufficient reasons. The teachers of
several northern counties will assem
ble at tho same timo, and an inter
change of views by an assemblage of
some of the brightest minds in the
stato who are actually engaged iv
educational work iv tho public
schools of Calitornia can bo . bene
ficial to a greater extent than if the
gathering wore confined to the
teachers of Amador county alouo.
All the county teachers are favorable
to tho plan of holding tho institute in
Sacramento. Another point in re
commendation of this plan is that it
is economical. Usually it is more
expensive to go abroad, than to re
main at home. But in this case it
will actually cost tho county less by
fully fifty per cent to havo tho
institute iv Sacramento than if it
wore held wilhin the county.
The Clarich Case.
by an oversight the Ledger stated
last week that Mrs Clarich shot and
killed Yojetich as he slept in a room
at the imperial hotel. This was a
mistake. Tho shooting did not take
place at the hotel, but in an Austrian
boarding house, near by. We are
pleased to make the correction. •
The release of the accused on pro
liuiiuary examination is a matter
of general comment. , It is admitted
on all sides that ' under the circum
stances as detailed by tho woman,
and corroborated iv a great measure
by others, there was not the faintest
hope of. a conviction, had the matter
been pressed to a jury trial, Why
then put th» county to the expense of
a^trial? oiioh is the process of rea
s'oning'from that side. . On the other
hand, it is claimed that it establishes
a. very bad precedent^ that a man
should bo murdered in his bed while
asleep, and the slayer not even sub
jected to the formality of a, jury trial.
Tho majesty of tho law demanded
some vinUication. Human life is too
sacred to bo deliberately takun. even
under the exceptional circumstances
in the ca3o under discussion, without
somo attempt at legal atonemout.
That the slayer had the sympathy of
the community is admittod, and tho
opinion was strongly entertained
that a trial would have been fruit
less of result. But tho condonation
of tho crimo by legal process, with
out a trial, is a very sorious matter.
While Mrs Clarich was offered the
hospitalities of the hospital in her
trouble, she concluded not to remain
there, and left for Oakland last Mon
day morning.
Married at San Rafael.
On the. ISth of .last month Ainbor

upon returning the young lady told
her mother, while some of hor friends
got'on to it through a nowspaper from
below. Mrs Meek has been omployed
for some time past by John Strohm
as bookkeeper, but will give up that
position in a few days to take, up
household duties.

Argonaut mine en Thursday of last
svfiek. Ho was employed in the
stopo, and in somo unexplained
manner missed his footing, and start
ed on a fall of 45 feet to ths bottom.
In hia descent, after going about
fifteen foot, he managed to grasp an
iron pipe, and held on. In this way
tho forco of tho fall was broken, and
he reached the hottom comparatively
uninjured. ,By contact with 'the
pipe, the skin was poeled from his
hands, and he has been compelled to
place himself under the doctor's care.

DECISION IN THE RUSSELL ESTATE
Letters of Administration Denied
the Daughter on the Ground ot
Not Being a Resident.
This is an application by John S.
Orchiaon, nominee of. Elizabeth Jane
Sywons, who claims to be the ille
gitimate daughter of the above Will
iam Ueury Kussell, deceased, and hia
heir at law, for the revocation ol
letters of administration of said
estate heretofore granted to George
M. H uberty as public administrator
of Amador county, and for the issu
ance to him of such letters.
Section ISGS of the code of civil
procedure of the state of California
specfles wh v o are entitled to admin
ister and the order of their priority,
tho children being in the second
olass, and the public administrator in
the eighth class.
Section 13ti3 code of civil pro
codure, under which this application
is brought, reads as follows:
1 "When letters of administration
have been granted to any. other per
son than the surviving husband or
wife, child, father, mother, brother
or sister cf the intestate, any one of
them who is competent, or any com
petent person at the written request
of any one of them, may obtain the
revocation of the letters, and be en
titled to the administration, by pre
senting to the court a petition pray
ing the revocation, and the letters
may be issued to him."
Section 139 d code of civil procedure
provides as follows:
No person is competent or entitled
to serve as administrator or adminis
tratrix who is not a bona tide resi
dent of the state.
- According to the construction
placed upon the provision of section
13G5 code of civil procedure by our
supreme court, the surviving husband
or wife, is the only person not a bona
fide resident of the state who has the
right to request the appointment of
sonio other person.

Counsel for respondent claims that
in order to entitlo her to nominate or
request the appointment of petitioner,
Mm Elizabeth Smyons, must have
been v bona fide resident of the state
at the time of the death of William
11. liussel], while counsel -for peti
tioner contends that there is no time
fixed or determined under our statute
when the residonce ot a person com
ing from another state or country to
re9ide in this state begins, but it
would appear to be a proper conclus
ion to draw from* all these sections
that she leust be a bona fide resident
at the time of exercising the right of
nomination, which in the case at bar
was February 27, lUO7, the date of
filing the nomination.
Was Elizabeth Jane Symon a bona
fide resident of California on Febru
ary 27, 1907.
Uesidonce is to be determined from
the intention of the party, and that
intention is to be gathered mainly
fi-cm his acts. Estate of Uordou, 142
Cal., 125. • '
Tho evidence upon this point is in
substance as follows: Eilzabeth Jane
Sytnon is 47 years of age. She was
born, reared, married, raised her
t.imily and lived in the immediate
neighborhood of Ulackwater, Corn
walj, England, until she came to
California in January, 1907. Her
mother lived all hbr life there, and
died and is buried there; her grand
mother, who lived with her, and who
is a very old lady, she left there ex
pecting her to return. She left her
two ' sous there with her married
daughter, and expected to return to
take charge of her daughter's child
when her husband returned from
South Africa,' so they could be to
gether as much as possible. . : She left
the house in which she had been
living for fifteen years- with her
furniture in it, and paid the rent in
advance for the quarter ending in
March to the Lords, to whom it had
Reverted on the death of her father
in-law, in ■ whom had been vested
a liie estate, and with whom she had
ilved. She did not come to" Cali
fornia when informed of the death of
William Henry Kussell, nor until she
was sent for by her son and Mrs .Lena
Clements, who sent her the money to
pay her passage. Upon her arrival in
California she went to the residence
of Mrs Lena Clements and stayed
four days, and in conversation with
Mrs Lena Clements, Miss Edith
Clements, Mr Sidney Clements and
Mrs Cowden,' stated that she wished
to liuish her business and return to
Kngland as soon as she could. In a
oouveisatiou with her uncle Matthew
Trudgen, at Mrs Clement's house, he
testilicd us follows:
1 told her it was far better for her
to stay in this country with her boys,
and 1 could do better for her than
what she could in England. And she
said she would study over the matter,
and so far as she has gone she has
oome to like tte country very much."
Sho then went to Oakland, and
stayed for about three weeks at the
residence of Mrs Orchison on Valdez
street ; then . Mr and Mrs Greaves,
who came out from England on the
same steamer, and with whom she
became acquainted on the way, pro
cured a house, and she went to live
with them,— took rooms from them.
She testified that she bought furniture
for. two rooms,' and uses Mrs Greaves'
kitchon and bath room, but tho evi
dence shows that Mrs Oreaves took
654 from her and used it, but did not
pay for any furniture with it, but
bought furniture on the instalment
plan; that the contract for it is in
Mr Greaves' name, and he is paying
for it in monthly instalments; the
furniture used by Mrs Symons being
part of it.
On January 2G, 1907, on Valdez
streot in Oakland, she, stated to Mrs
Lena Clements' and Edith Clements
in reply to a statement by them, that
she would feel the cold in Oakland
next winter; that she would not be
there next winter.
On February 5, 1907, at the resi
dence of Mrs Lena Clements, in a
conversation with Mrs Clements, Miss
Cleuiouts and Mrs J. i). Cowden, she
stated her uncle wanted to take her
back with him to Seattle in a weelr or
two, but that her son Willie would
not hear ot it; but that she would go
back to Eugland by way of Seattle
and visit her uncle and his family.
On January 31, 1907, she filed in
this court her petition for letters of
administration to be issue to her, and
for au order revokiug the letters
theretofore granted to the public
adtniuistrator on October 2G, 1906,
alleging that she was the daughter of
deceased and a resident of Oakland.
She appeared in court with her wit
nesses ou February 11, 1907, and de
muuded that a hearing be had at
once; but after demurrer to her peti
tion was filed and disposed of, the
hearing was continued, and the public
administrator given to February 18,
to file his answer. This answer was
Gled on that day, and denied that she
was a resident of Oakland, and
averred that she was not a bona fide
resideut of the state of California,
but a resident of England. She
therenpon.on February 27, 1907, with
drew her petition, and filed a written
nomination nud request for the ap
pointmont of Johu S. Orchison as
such administrator, accompanied by
his petition, upon which this bearing

was had. She then in the latter part
of March or the first of April wrote
to her daughter enclosing a note to
the Lords terminating her tenancy of
the honse, and instructing her to re
move tho furniture, which she testifi
ed was sent to Kedruth, an adjoining
village to be sold, but has not been
sold. She also testifies that she sent
for her youngest son to come to this
oountry. On April 12, 1907, in a
conversation with Mr E. A. Free
man, who called npon her and en
deavored to sell her some real estate,
she stated that she was not in a posi
tion to talk about buying real estate
at present, because she had not yet
determined to remain here. She
testified at the hearing that she had
intended coming here for a long
time, and intended to stay if she
liked it. but admitted on cross
examination that she had never
mentioned this intention to anyone,
or expressed it in any of her letters
to Mrs Clements, or her son Willie,
or any one else. She further testifies
that she likes this country and in
tends to remain, and is a resident of
California. She and Mrs Greaves
deny the conversation of April 12,
1907, testified to by Mr Freeman, and
relate a different conversation, but
Mr Freeman denies that Mrs Greaves
was present at the conversation. .
From the evidence only partly
stated above, this court is called
upon to draw its conclusions.
Counsel for petition contend that the
evidence of Mr Freeman falls to the
ground, and needs no notice by rea
son of the testimony of Mrs Symon
and Mrs Greaves. It is not the
quantity but the quality of the testi
mony that should govern the court.
Mr Freeman is a reportable member
of the bar of this county and state,
and has been for many years, was dis
trict attorney of this county for four
years, practicing before this court.
To adopt the verison of his testimony
urgedvby 'Counsel for respondent,
would be to find that be had volunt
arily committed perjury in order
that the public administrator and
his counsel might receive the fees
and commissions of this estate, and
to base this finding upon the testi
mony of one seeking- to inherit the
estate of the deceased as his illegiti
mate daughter properly legitimated
under our statutes, and her frieud
both strangers to our country, our
customs and our laws, and further
more Freeman was entirely disinter
ested.
A careful examination of all the
acts, declarations and conduct fo the
said Elizabeth Jane Symon from the
death of William Henry Kussell to
the time of the hearing forces tho
conclusion that she never intended to
change her residence, and that she is
not a bona fide resident of the state
of California, and was not at the
date of the nomination of petitioner.
This conclusion renders it un
necessary for the court to pass upon
the other issues tendered, as this is
decisive of the application. They can
be properly and fully determined
when the estate is ready for distri
bution and all parties will then be
bound by such determination. To
decide them now might hamper the
court in its final determination, and
might also be detrimental to Mrs
Symons.
The public administrator has had
charge of the probating of this estate
for nearly a year, and the interests of
the estate will be : best subserved in
bis continuance.
It follows that the petition of John
S. Orchison should be denied.
Counsel for respondent will pre
pare findings and order accordingly.
Done in open court, September 27,
1907. R. C. Rust Judge.

Charged with Killing Stock.
Nick Eadovich . a few duys ago
found one of his cows lying dead on
the roadway by his ranch two miles
north of Jackson. An examination
disclosed the fact that it had been
shot with a rifle, of 32 caliber. An
other cow belonging to him was also
found to have been shot and severely
wounded, whether mortally or not
remains to be seen. Kadovich came
to town and laid tho matter before
the sheriff's office,, expressing his
belief that one of his neighbors, with
whom he had not been ! on friendly
terms, was 'the author of the mis
chief. Sheriff Gregory went up to
the scene thereafter, and upon in
vestigation discovered evidence which
tended to show that the animal had
been shot in the orchard of W. E.
Speer, • an adjoining land owner.
There was but a slim wire lecce
dividing the holdings of these neigh
bors, and the frequent trespass of
stock from one ranch to the other has
been a source of trouble for a long
time. The sheriff found a rifle that
had recently been discharged in the
Speer dwelling, and thereafter accus
ed Spear of committing the crime,
who finally acknowledged that he
shot the animal to be rid of the
annoyance. Kadovich . swore out a
warrant of arrest, and Speer will
be arrested to-day.
Under the law it is a felony to kill
cattle. But it is likely the matter
will be settled without a resort to a
trial. : ; <

Chinese Music
The Chinese hare eight instruments
for making their ritual music— the bell,
the flute, the drum, the sonorous stone,
the fife, the plume, the shield and the
ax. The last three make no music, but
are used as decoration or emblem in
the musical ceremonies and are enu
merated as musical instruments. In
every ceremony there are always two
.Instruments of each kind, sometimes
as many as four or six, never an odd
number, in order to emphasize the
duality of the Chinese people. For in
stance, one drum announces the be
ginning of the music, and its mate
strikes the last note; one bell calls,
and its counterpart answers.

Toads' Hatching Places.
Every tiny toad lays a stupendous
number of eggs. A scientist received
11,545 eggs from one toad, a necessary
fertility, since the chance 3of an egg
developing into a toad are lass than
one in a thousand. Within two weeks
after the eggs are laid the young tad
poles begin to appear arid feed first
on their gelatinous envelope. Next the
slimy deposits common to ponds and
swamps are attacked.^ Steadily grow
the young wrigglers until their bodies
enlarge to the size of thumb nails by
the end of June. The long tall now is
absorbed and the legs develop. Tftey
begin to hop on the bank and disperse,
never to return save In the breeding
season. It is at the spring of the year
that the toads awake from their win
ter sleep below the rocks and scrub.
They often have been literally frozen
stiff, but they return to life as healthy
as ever and on the firs"t balmy night
migrate toward the nearest breeding
pond. Usually this is the old home
stead where they were born, for the
toad is a domestic animal and will
travel a mile or more for the sake of
returning to the place of its hatching.

When you go to buy a suit of furni
ture nowadays in one of our depart
ment stores you don't have to specu
late as to how It will look In your room
nor whether it will fit In or not. As
soon as the salesman sees that a par
ticular suit has met your fancy he calls
for a porter or two and turns^ them
loose in one of several rooms fitted up
around the main showroom, setting
them at work removing all the furni
ture in it Then the suit that you seem
to be hankering after is placed in ap
propriate positions in this room, and
you can see at a glance just how the
bedroom or parlor or dining room will
look if you buy that particular suit
There are a dozen of these smaller
rooms around the main showroom, and
as each one is decorated in a different
manner it is easy to pick one out that
approximates the scheme of your room
at home. Like many modern ways of
selling goods it is expensive in the be
ginning, but It pays in the end, for this
plan of showing goods seldom fails of
its intended effect— New York Press.

says Lipplncott's Magazine. St Peter
refused him, however, telling him he
was too great a sinner to enter there,
and bade him go away. The man
went a little distance from the gate
and then crowed three times like a
rooster. St. Peter at once threw open
the gate and cried out: "Come in, Pat!
We'll let bygones be bygones!"

Took It Literally.
It !s told of the late Chauncey Sha
fer, who bears tho same relation t«*
New York's "anecdotage" that Sydney
Smith does to London's, that he em
ployed In his law office a stunted youth
of very tractable temperament.
One day Mr. Shafer returned from
lunch in a lively mood and, by token
of the madeira he had consumed; sum
moned Billy into his private office. .
"Boy," he said carelessly, "go over
to the special term and see what in
they're doing up there."
The late Judge Brady was presiding
over the trial of an action involving
many interesting questions of substan
tive law; hence the courtroom was
empty save for the litigants, their coun
sel and the necessary witnesses. Judge
Brady's kindliness toward women and
children was proverbial, and when
Billy stood against the railing of the
inclosure, his face barely reaching the
balustrade, the judge noticed him im
mediately. He Interrupted the argu
ments of counsel and turned to Billy.
"Well, my lad," he said In suave,
judicial accents, "what can I do for
you?"
"I'm from Mr. Shafer's office," Billy
replied, "and he wants to know what
in you're up to over here."— Success

From Out the Grave.
'In the little village of Tewin, Hert
fordshire, England, there are five large
trees growing out of a single grave,
and thereby hangs a curious story. On
the slab | that marks the grave was
carved the inscription:
"Here lyeth inter'd the body of the
Right Honorable Lady Anne Grime
stone, wife of Sir Samuel Grimestone,
Bart, of Gohambury, in Hertfordshire,
daughter of the late Right Honorable
the Earl of Thanet, who departed this
life Nov. 22, 1713, in the sixtieth year
of her age."
The village story says that Lady
Grimestoue, persisting in a lifelong de
nial of the existence of a God, on her
deathbed declared in answer to the
exhortations of her friends that if
in the other world she -found that there
was indeed a God five trees would
grow out of her grave. The woman
died and was buried. Shortly after
the interment the five little shoots be
gan to appear, growing constantly un
til they split the masonry and wrecked
the railing about the tomj>.— New York

A foreign tourist who had received
permission to visit one of our large
asylums for the insane was surprised
Ot the neatness, quietude and good or
der that prevailed within the institu
tion. He asked if it was always like
that, and the polite attendant who was
showing him through the buildings
said it was.
"We have what we call our ■ violent
wards, of course, but I presume yon
(Would not care to see these."
"I think not."
- "It Is just as well, perhaps. They
are rather noisy, although, of course,
we exercise the same care in providing
for the welfare of the inmates that
you see in this part of the institution.
We also have, a section where we keep
the 'incurables.'"
"These Inmates, then, are considered
curable."
"Their cases are at least hopeful."
"I am greatly interested," said the
visitor, "but I will not take up any
more of your time. You have other
duties to attend to, have you not?"
"Yes, sir. This is merely one of my
recreations. In one of the rooms in
the main building I am engaged dur
ing most of the time in pursuing what
may be called my life work." j
"Your life work? May I ask. what
that is?" , -•; . . •

For Shakespeare's Sake.
There is something remarkably at
. tractive for an actress in the rolling
cadences of the Bard of Avon, and I
do not wonder that so many players
dream of playing his work. I think it
was in Los Angeles some years ago
that a young actor who was then be
coming popular decided that the time
was ripe for him to do Ilamlet What
his mental process was in arriving at
this decision I have of course no
means of knowing, but an apocryphal
anecdote was told of him the morning
after his first appearance as the mel
ancholy Dane. It seems a friend ap
proached him and said:
"How do you feel this morning?" :
"I have failed to get my whole mean-
Ing Into the character. I shall never
play Hamlet again," was the reply.
"Oh, but you must play the part once
again," remonstrated the friend.
"And why?" asked the young actor
despondently.
"Shakespeare turned over In his cof
fin last night. You will have to do It
once again, for you can't leave the poor
chap in that position," said the friend.

Racing at Ascot.
Racing at Ascot dates back a great
number of years, and it is recorded that
Queen Anne was the first royal person
age to patronize the fixture, in 1711.
The first and second Georges were not
great patrons of the turf, but they
bred race horses on a largo scale In
order to encourage their subjects, and
George 111. gave a plate of 100 guineas
to be competed for. Ever since those
times the great annual festival on the
famous Berkshire heath has met with
Study of Man.
The only school for the study of
human nature is the world. The only
text books are the works of men like
Shakespeare, Hugo, Cervautes, Sterno
and other students who learned In
ttat school. But the effectual study
of human nature demands from the
student a vast fund of love and sym
pathy. You will never get admitted
into the heart of a fellow creature un
less you go as a friend.— Kobert Blatch
fpsd.in Clarion.  ■_*-. '. j
Tha Ruling Passion.
A celebrated musical critic was mar
ried In church some years ago, and i'
after the ceremony, as the wedding |
procession marched down the aisle, the j
organist played the wedding march
from "Lohengrin." When near the 1
door, the bridegroom stopped In the {
march and addressed the wondering
assembly thus:
"I know I am committing a breach
of etiquette as well as propriety in |
doing this, but I am not to blame. It
is my mental organization which has
become Ineffably sensitive by reason
of the critical nature of my duties?'
Then he drew from the pocket of his
dress coat a well thumbed copy of the
score of "Lohengrin." Opening It at
the march, he went over to the organist .
and said:
"What offended my ear was the fact
(hat In the seventeenth bar of the da
capo passage you flatted very badly,
and in the andante movement you
Blurred the appoggiatura. Now," put
ting his finger upon the passage, "let
us try that again."
Once more the organ pealed forth,
and this time the player, conscious
that the great critic was listening to
him, accomplished hi 3 duty with credit
to himself and to the great satisfac
tion of the critic— London Standard.
The Sick Chinaman.
Perhaps 'nowhere in the world is
family affection stronger than among
the Chinese, yet their method of deal-
Ing with the sick Is pitiable to the
more enlightened world. When a fa
vorite son falls ill his life depends
largely upon a package of Joss sticks.
The grieving father seeks a joss house,
pro-ures a handful of these sticks and,
taking them home, -lights them. He
shakes them gently. Soon one falls.
Is It lighted? Eagerly the father
watches it. Will it burn to the end
or go out? If it is entirely consumed
the son will survive; if it goes out he
will die. It goes out!
The Chinaman reasons thus: His son
was chased by a devil and .when the
devil touched him he became 111. The
devil demonstrated by means of the
joss sticks that his son must die. Had
the joss sticks burned to the end it
would have signified the future recov
ery of the' patient. Joss men would
have been' called In, a most fearful
din would have followed, and the dev
il and all his lower imps would have
been driven away.— New York Herald.
A Life Sentence.
Said Mr. Joacker, who was reading
the paper, "Another poor wretch has
been given a life sentence at hard
labor."
Said Mrs. Joacker, who was embroid
ering blue roses: "Probably he de
serves It What is he guilty of?"
"Fraud and no visible means of sup
port. He obtained clothes and a fine
turnout with no money and nothing
collectible. He seems to be larger
and stronger than most of that class,
yet it is plain that he has never done
a tap of work, though he has managed
to live well so far. But. the poor fel
low takes his sentence hard and cries
piteously, protesting his innocence." ■
• "The wretch! He must have dealt
with perfect fools!"
"No; his victim is our own friend,
Jack Smith.""

"Shouting."
Early Australian gold diggers . made
many contributions to the slang of
that commonwealth. One of these
was "shouting," or standing drinks for
everybody within hall, a practice of,
which the lucky digger was very fond.
To refuse to drink .with a digger who
had "struck it rich," or turned up a .
big nugget, was a deadly insult. A
critic quotes from J. F. Hogan's "His
tory of the Irish In Australia:" "Shout
ing was at one time almost universal i
To shout in a public house means to
insist on ' everybody present, friends .
and strangers alike, drinking at the ',
shouter's expense. It frequently hap- i
pens that each one 'shouts' in succes
sion." ; .
The Rosetta Stone.
The Rosetta stone was found in 1709
by a French engineer officer In an ex
cavation made near Rosetta. It has
an inscription in three different lan
guages, the hieroglyphic, the demotic
and the Greek. It was erected 195 B.
C. in honor of Ptolemy Eplphanes be
cause he remitted the dues of the priest- •
ly body. The great value of the Roset
ta stone lies in the fact that it- fur
nished the key whereby the Egyptian
hieroglyphics were deciphered. j

Willed Away the Laundry.
When a perfectly strange woman
came for the soiled clothes the mis
tress of the house came to the conclu
sion that her own laundress had sim
ply employed a new messenger and
made no comment on the circum
stances.
But when two weeks had gone by
and still the old laundress, known as
Susan, no last name having been men
tioned, did not appear the mistress of
the house felt that she would be lack
ing in her duty if she did not make
some inquiry about her. ._'
"Where is Susan?" she asked the
tall and bony structure who came for
the clothes.
"She has gone to Pennsylvania to
live, yessum," returned this person,
with composure. "She went to Penn
sylvania some time ago, an' she lef
goodby fer yah, but s' long es yuh
didn't seem tub notis I didn't say

Satlafled Har Curiosity.
A certain south side lady, has com*
to the conclusion that curiosity can no
longer be indulged In with any degree
of safety. One . night she entertained
a group of friends and at the moment
of departure, when conversation al
ways lags a trifle, her eye fell idly on
a package carried by one of the men.
"What la It you have there r ehe
asked, with hardly a thought of what
she was saying.
"Well," said another guest, springing
forward, with mock indignation, "If
he's going to be searched, I feel that
all of us should be subjected to the
same indignity.'.'
"Oh, I," commenced the hostess, her
tecs flushing— "l give you my word
that"— _ • :
"I can prove the ownership of this
watch," cried one man.
"This was my mother's ring," ex
plained another. And so it went down
the line until the laugh came just
in time to save the life of the hostess.

account the manager noticed all meals
charged at 50 cents.
"Look here, Charlie; I see you have
charged us 50 cents per meal on your

it is Impossible to get a meal for more
than 25 cents in your entire territory.
