OLDEST CLOCK IN ENGLAND.
Ejected In 1320 In One of the Towen
of Peterborough Cathedral.
Peterborough cathedral has the old
est working clock in England. It was
erected about 1320 and is probably the
work' of a monastic clockmaker. It is
the only one now known that is wound
vp over an old wooden wheel. This
wheel is about twelve feet In circum
ference, and the galvanized cable;
nbout 300 feet in length, supports" a
leaden weight of three hundredweight,
which has to be wound up daily.
The clock is said to be of much more
primitive construction than that made
by Henry de Nick for Charles V. of
France in 1370. The clock chamber
is in the northwest tower, some 120
feet high, where the sunlight has not
penetrated for hundreds of years, and
the winding is done by the light of a
caudle.
The gong is the great tenor bell of
the cathedral, which weighs thirty
two hundredweight, and It is struck
hourly by an eighty pound hammer.
The going and the striking parts of
the clock are some yards apart, com
munication being by a slender wire.
The clock has no dial. Tbe time is
shown on the main wheel of the es
capement, which goes round once in
two hours.— London Chronicle.
THE TOV»¥r OF HUNGER.
A Famous TVison of Pisa Lone Stace
Destroyed.
"The Tower of Hunger" was a name
given to the tower of Gualandi, in
Pisa, celebrated because of the refer
ence made to it In Dante's "Inferno."
Ugojino. count of Gherardesca (1220
89), was the head of a leading Ghi
belllne family in Pisa, Deserting the
Ghibelllnes, he went over to the
Guelphs. Afterward he returned to
his own side and Joined that uncom
promising faction which regarded
Archbishop Ruggieri as their head, un
til dissensions arose between him and
them after he had killed the archbish
op's nephew In a quarrel.
In the; summer of 128S Ugollno was
seized by the Ghibelllnes and sent a
prisoner to f:he tower of Gualandi,
with his two sons, and two grandsons.
Here they were kept till March, 1280,
when. the door of the tower . was fas
tened, the keys thrown into the Arno
and the prisoners left to die of starva
tion. ; The tower, which was ever after
known as the "Tower of Hunger," was
in ruins at the end of the fifteenth cen
tury and was finally destroyed in 1655.
AFRICA.
The Way That Name Was Bestowed
I'pon the Continent.
The name Africa was given by the
Roman conquerors, after the third
Punic war, B. O. 146, to the province
which they formed to cover the terri
tory of Carthage. It was most prob
ably adopted from the word "Afry
gah," the Carthagenian term for a col
ony.
This original Africa was limited in
extent. Its borders reached, according
to Pliny, from tlie River Tusca on the
west, which divided it from Numidla,
to the bottom of the Syrtis Minor on
the southeast, though Ptolemy carries
It .as far east as. the bottom of the
Great Syrtis, making It Include Numl
dia and Tripolltana.
In later days the whole African con
tinent took Its name from this part,
which In Its narrower limits corre
sponded with the modern regency of
Tunis and was called by the Greeks
Lybia. Africus, the stormy southwest
wind, was so called in Italy because it
blew from Africa.
Implements of Warfare.
There is a story of a privateer's
crew of forty to fifty men capturing a
Turkish galley with 500 seamen and
soldiers on board by means of a swarm
of bees judiciously thrown among the
unspeakable ones. However this may
be, there are enough authentic In
stances of strange methods of attack
to provide amply sufficient material
for the casuist in deciding what is fair
and what unfair In war. Burning
naphtha, boiling lead, birds, carcases
of men and horses, Chinese stinkpots,
besides the implements already men
tioned, have all been used for offensive
or defensive purposes in actual war
fare.
Prank ot the Lightning;.
In 1844 a fishing smack off one of the
Shetland Isles was struck by light
ning during a fierce storpi. The bolt
first struck the mast, which It splin
tered completely. It then passed to a
watch in the pocket of a man sitting
close* to the mast and completely melt
ed it. The man not only was unin
jured, but he did not know what had
taken place till he took his watch from
his pocket and found it fused into a
mass.
Windmill*.
"I never knew till now why this was
such a windy country," said the bright
little girl traveling through Illinois.
"And have you discovered why?"
asked her father.
"Of course.^ See all the windmills oa
these farms we're passing."—Philadel

A LOGICAL SAVAGE.
The Way Be Silenced a Mlaaiouar?
In an Argument.
"I used to know in Australia aa in
telligent and interesting missionary,"
said an English nobleman. "He and I
were talking one day about the na
tives of New Guinea, and he told me
bow one of these natives had stumped
him in a certain argument* It seems
that he had accosted the native and
urged him to let himself be civilized.
" 'But what good,' the native asked,
'will this civilization of yours do me?*
" 'Well,' said the missionary, 'yon
will cease, for one thing, to [ Idle . all
your time away. You will learn. the
delights of honest labor.'
" 'What good will the labor do ine7
" 'Through It yon will gradually ac
cumulate money, and in time, with
frugality, you will possess much stow
of honestly acquired riches.'
"The native was still unconvinced.
'What good will the riches do me?' wai
his next question.
"'They,' said the missionary, *wiH
enable you to cease from work at last
and to spend the rest of your days in
well earned rest.'
"The native laughed.
" 'It seems to me,' he said, 'that if I
did as you say I would be taking a
mighty roundabout course to get to the
place I started from,' "
INDIA RUBBER.
Its Form of Structure Which Permits
It te Be Elastic.
Modern physics teach us that the
molecules of all bodies are in a state of
incessant motion; that the Intimate
structure of matter Is, in fact, a repro
duction on an infinitely minute scale of
the revolving suns and planets,
. In gases and liquids this motion Is
most extensive In range, but in solids
the movements of the molecules are
more restrained, and they merely os
cillate or rotate about a certain mean
position, the range of motion being
strictly governed by the attractions
producing it
If by the pull of an outside force the
molecules are drawn out beyond the
limit of their mutual attractions the
body is broken, b'g't within this limit It
will recover Itself when the pull ceases.
We may regard the particles of rubr
ber as revolving in circles. When it Is
stretched these orbits become elliptic,
returning to the circular form when
released. As then this substance pos
sesses a very wide range of variation
of molecular distance without rupture
it is eminently elastic.
DOCTOR OF DANCING.
This Title Was Given f o Peanchntnni
by Louis XW.
In France during the reign of Louis
XIV. dancing took a very prominent
position among court festivities, and
. many members of the royal family
took part In the complex ballets of tba
time. Louis himself, no mean perform
er, took lessons for twenty years from
Beauchamps, who was called the far
tber of nil dancing masters and upon
whom the king conferred the title doc
tor as a special mark of favor.
Beauchamps had the honor of ap
pearing ns partner with the king in the
minuet, a dance which was introduced
in 1050 in France, and no court ball
was opened in Europe for a century
and a half without It.
About the ygar |661 a royal aead
ejny of dancing was formed under the
auspices of Beauchamps, Lull!, Mollere
and others, the object of which was to
elevate the art and check all abuses.
Of this academy Beauchamps was
chief, with the title of director.— Lon :

A Story of a Scholar.
Theodor Mommsen, the famous his
torian, had not only the appearaqct
t>ut the manner of a scholar. Once
during the half hour's drive from Ber
lin to Charlottenburg the car In which
the professor rode went badly off the
track. The rest of the passengers
alighted, the horses were removed and
the stranded car was left until help
could be found. Mommsen remained,
reading his book. An hour passed, and
the sound of levers and Jacks and the
plunging of horses' hoofs aroused h!n>
from his reverie. With no sign of dis
composure he arose from his seat and
went to the door. "Ah," said he, "we
seem to have come to a standstill."
Maine Counties,
The three original counties of Maine
had good old English county names,
York, Cumberland and Lincoln. Onty
two, Oxford and Somerset,- have been
similarly named since, all the rest hav
ing good American appellations. For
the names of Androscoggln, Aroostook,
Kennebec, Penobscot, Plscataquls and
Sagadahoc find their origin among the
aborigines, while franklin, Hancock,
Knox and Washington bear the names
of distinguished Americans of the
white race.
A Peat lv Growth.
"I lost my foot In the war," said the
tramp, "and I'm trying to raise enough
money to get out to California."
"What do you want to go to Califor
nia for?" asked the woman at the door.
''Oh, I've heard that there are things
which grow a foot in a day out there."

Dragging Pains
2825 Keeley St.,

I suffered -with falling and con-
gestion of the womb, with severe
pains through the groins. I suf-
fered terribly at the time of men-
struation, had blinding headaches
and rushing of blood to the brain.
What to try I knew not, for it
seemed that I had tried all and
failed, but I had neyer tried Wine
of Cardni, that bletied remedy for
sick women. I found it pleasant
to take and soon knew that I had
the right medicine. New blood
seemed to course through my veins
and after using eleven bottles I
wm a well woman.
Mrs. Bush is now in perfect
health because she took Wine of
Cardui for menstrual disorders,
bearing down pains and blinding
headaches when all other remedies
failed to bring her relief. Any
sufferer may secure health by tak-
ing Wine of Cardui in h,?r home.
The first bottle convinces the pa-
tient she is on the road to health.

When Kol Floats In Japan.
When the kol floats from its bamboo
pole It means trouble is brewing— in
Japan. The kol Is a paper fish brave In
purple and gold, orange and black, so
skillfully made that the wind, Inflating
It, sets It swirling and' swerving as if
alive with' an energetic flapping oX its
fins. A fisherman wijl tell you that it
represents the carp, that mighty swim
mer which makes its way upstream
•against all obstacles. A poet will af
firm that the kol typifies predominance.
It Is all one and the same. When the
fish floats over a Japanese dwelling Jt
announces the birth of a maje child,
but when war Is Imminent or in prog
ress the streets of the cities are gay
with 'the polychromatic emblem flaunt
ing and flashing before the door of
every loyal household. This Is equlva.
lent to the display of bunting in the
Occident when troops go forth to war.
Mongolian Sheep Killers.
A recent traveler In Mongolia writes:
"On arrival In camp a sheep is killed
for the stranger's benefit. It Is worth
going to Mongolia to eat mutton, which
Is unlike any other in my experience.
No traveler who has written on the
country falls to mention it Mission*
arles, Protestant and Catholic alike,
refer to Its succulence. The method oi
killing sheep is curious and unpleas-j
ant. The animal Is thrown on Its back,
when the butcher makes an Incision inj
Its belly, Into which he thrusts hit
hand, where he presumably severs an
artery, as death ensues and the car-,
cass Is suffused with blood. He then
takes a ladle and transfers the blood
to a receptacle at his side. No drop ia
spilled."
Memory.
■ The different kinds of memory are
described in an extended article In Coa
mos, Paris. It Is noted that some ch\V
dren, . when they learn a lesson, hay*
only to read It over a few times; others
will not remember It unless they hava
heard it recited; others must repeat it
aloud to themselves. These are the
three kinds of memory— visual, audi
tive and motor. Those who need to lo
cite the lesson aloud to tbeniselves are
at once auditive and motor. Certain
persons retain a passage well only aft
er they have copied It out. These have
a combination of motor and visual
memory.
The Manner* Breath.
The old fable of the siren has its
duplicate in one of the most deadly ot
modern weapons. The whistle of a
bullet ought to be a deadly sound; it
I? surprising to be told that it is a
beautiful one. Mr. H. F. Trevost Bat
tersby snys in his South African notes
vailed "In the Web of n 'War:"
The Mauser's most melodious period
In from 800 to 18,000 yards. Over that
distance its note is the most exquisitely
lovely of single sounds. "The silky
lireath of the Mauser" is a phrase that
adequately describes it,
But there is something more about it
than its beauty, something strange and
baleful. It goes by like the singing of
a wondering soul that can find rest on
ly by bringing death to another. It is
t sighing so Indescribably tender and
lad and sweet that every sound of hu
man lips seems without charm beside
It
After lying for a time under that
silky breath, one has even j£ resist a
desire to lift his head and take the
pest puff cf it jn Ms fagj.

Salt pork is a famous old-
fashioned remedy for con-
sumption. "Eat plenty of
pork," was the advice to the
consumptive 50 and 100
years ago.
Salt pork is good if a man
can stomach it. The idea
behind it is that fat is the
food the consumptive needs
Scott's Emulsion is the mod-
ern method of feeding fat to
the consumptive. Pork is too
rough for sensitive stomachs.
Scott's Emulsion is the most
refined of fats, especially
prepared for easy digestion.
Feeding him fat in this
way, which is often the only
way, is half the battle, but
Scott's Emulsion does more
than that. There is some-
thing about the combination
of cod liver oil and hypophos-
phites in Scott's Emulsion
that puts new life into the
weak parts and has a special
action on the diseased lungs.

DO IT TODAY.
Tomorrow May Be Too Late and Then
Tea Weald Be Sonr.
If you have a flower to give, give it
today. One thwb of gladness is worth
more to the living heart than a wealth
of costly blooms laid, however tender
ly, above the dead one.
If you have a kindly visit to make,
make it today lest another step In and
lay his quiet hand upon the. longing
heart and still forever its fret and pain
and power of glad response. In the
city of the dead. In the silence of the
•grave, hearts are never ■ lonely any
more. Tney have no heed or need. •
If you have kisses to bestow, let the
dear living lips their sweetness know
today. ■■::'.,):: ' ■ £+?;';
If you've smiles to give, give them
today. Living eyes are often hungry.
Though their gajse be seemingly - so
calm, so quiet and mayhap so proud,
the smiles may be a touch of heaven
for them. If they are closed In death,
tomorrow your fondest smile would
matter naught. ■': • • • - > i-.
If you have a helpful, hopeful, loving
word to say, say It today. It may keep
some heart from breaking, some soul
from falling. No word or cry can
break the seal tomorrow— lf death
whispers then— to ears that hear today.

A I'seful Tiger.
"Snakes nnd hyenas are strange pets,
but strangest of all Is a full grown ti
ger, and such a pet lmd Major Mansell-
Pleydell," says A. Mervyn Smith in his
book. "It used to be chained up just In
front of the dopr of his bungalow. The
major had a method of rnnnlng up
bills with local tradesmen, tint there
was great difficulty in getting pay
ment, as none of the bill eollrctors was
venturesome enough, to cross the
guardian at the door. It was a great
joke of the major's when asked to pay
his bill to reply: 'Ilnre you sent your
bill? Your man hits never presented It
at my bouse.' Brutus, as the tiger was
named, seemed to know what was re
quired of him. When chained before
his master's door he would He with bis
head between his forepaws and watcb
the gate/ If a stranger entered he
would lift his head and breathe heav
ily, and this was enough to scare the
most venturesome of bill collectors."

Jokal's Joke.
At a banquet held In his honor In the
town of Torda, Maurus Jokai, the Hun
garian writer, was called upon to pro
pose the toast of "The Ladles." He
made an excellent speech, during which
he continually toyed with the brown
curls upon his forehead. • Finally he
said: "I raise my glass in honor of the
gracious ladles of Torda. May they all
live until my hair grows gray." •. His
audience drank to the toast, but it was
easy to see by the faces of the ladles
present that they did not think much
of the compliment Jokal rose again
from his seat and took from his head
a magnificent brown wig, showing an
entirely bald head beneath it v "My
hair," he added, "will never grow
gray." And the ladles, who had not
known of his baldness, were more than
pacified.
Two Headed Symbols.
Both Russia and Germany display
two headed eagles on their standards.
Yet this symbol is considered by some
heralds to be 'merely the result of the
heraldic practice of "dlmidiation." Thla
was simply a child's way of impaling
two coats of arms on the same shield
by the primitive method of cutting
each in half and taking the dexter bait
of one and the sinister half of the other
and placing them back to back, as it
were. Strange two headed beasts nat
urally resulted, as, -for instance, when
a lion and an eagle were halved and
Joined together. The griffin is sup
posed to have been evolved from two
lions rampant by dlmidiation. It robs
the two headed eagle of half its ter
rors to know that It owes its origin
to this sort of child's play.
Childish Cariosity.
Little Florence, aged Biz, had been
spending the afternoon with a neighbor
who had just lost a near relative, and
who was working very hard to get
some mourning gowns made. Florence
had been very good and asked no ques
tions, but when she returned home ber
tnquisltiveness asserted itself. Her
mother, explained as clearly as she
could, and for a few moments Florence
sat In deep silence. Then:
"Are all her gowns going to be black,
"And Is she going to wear black
nightgowns?"
"No, dear.'!
"Well, doesn't she feel Just as bad
in the night as she does in the day?"

"Sacred Ladybirds."
Among the Insects that can be claim
ed aa friends of the market grower
probably none are more useful than
the ladybirds. It Is said that in
mediaeval times this Insect was sacred
to the virgin, hence Its popular name.
"Although In these prosaic times we
may," says the Fruitgrower, "have got
over. the superstition regarding the In
sect's sacredness so far as the virgin
Is concerned, for the good they do they
should be sacred to every market grow

FRIDAY NOVEMBER 11, 1904
THE ELECTION.
The result of the national election
' is so overwhelmingly in favor of the
: republicans that it presages the dis
'- integration of. the democratic party.
Never in the political history of the
country has such a crushing defeat
overtaken a great national party.
It was a foregone conclusion that
Roosevelt would be elected, but few
believed the victory would be of
such a sweeping character. Every
northern and western state has been
swept by the republican tidal wave.
There is nothing left for the demo
crats but the south, and the solidity
of that section has been broken.
Parker has made . a much poorer
showing than Bryan did four years
ago. No doubt the tact that the
democratic standbearer in the iast
days of the campaign, in the bitter
ness of impending defeat, lost his
temper, and made public charges of
a slanderous nature against the
president, lost him the support of
many self-respecting democrats, f. It
was a thing unheard of before in a
presidential campaign, for one nomi
nee to stoop to making serious
charges against his opponent, and
especially when there was nothing
brought forward to substantiate
them. It will take the democrats
four years to gather the broken
fragments of their party together
for the next campaign. They are so
utterly routed that they will prob
ably seek some more alliances before
challenging the verdict of the ballot
box again. The American people
cannot be flim-flammed by demo
cratic sophistries. They know when
. they are doing tolerably well, and
• have resolved, in the most emphatic
manner, to "let well enough alone."
California has contributed its
quota to the republican tidal wave.
■She has given the largest majority
■ for Roosevelt ever given for a presi
■ deritial candidate. It looks like a
" congressional delegation has
been elected. • V;
- Amador county has scored heavily
on the republican side. The Roose
velt electors have a plurality of
; 370. Only four precincts in the
county were carried by the demo
crats.and these by very slim margins.
Of the local candidates, Caminetti,
for congress, made a gallant fight,
and won his home county by a hand
some majority of over 500. He was
expected to do this. .The other
heavy republican counties, however,
: swept him to defeat with the rest of
his party aspirants for congressional
honors. ■'■'-■'
t - .C. H. McKenney, republican for
assemblyman, ran behind his ticket
in nearly every precinct in the
I county. Of course he is carried to
-victory by the sheer popularity of
-the party ticket. However, the
Jpeople have not failed to register
■ ■ their protest at the course pursued
"by him in the last legislature, in at
tempting to override the constitu
tion which he was sworn to respect
and obey. " The rebuke is all the
more striking when it is remembered
that his opponent never entered the
• limits of Amador county during the
canvass. He was in the east from
the time he was nominated until a
few days before the election. . Con-
Isequently he was not able to do any
electioneering whatever. What
-would have occurred if an active
campaign had been made in his be
half can only be surmised. , ,'V-
The supervisor contests have
brought about a peculiar situation.
Wesley M. Amick has been re-elected
by a decisive majority. M. Brinn,
I the republican candidate in town
ship 4, has been defeated by Fraser,
democrat.. In township 1 John
Strohm has won a victory as an in
dependent candidate. This makes
the board stand two democrats and
two republicans, with John Strohm,
the independent member, holding
the balance of power. :^.'.v^
THE RIGHT SPIRIT OF WORK.
Some people work to live, and
being in consequence indifferent to
success, do not win it. Many live
to work, and desiring success, secure
it. No one can succeed who does
not love the work in which he is en
gaged. Those who regard work as
irksome, to be done as a necessity,
who work only in order that they
may live, never advance, and cannot
appreciate and understand the suc
cess of the man who engages in work
for the pleasure and satisfaction it
gives, as well as the living it affords.

RIGHT TO VOTE
Some discussion has been indulged
in of late on account of'the fact that
some, persons, not now actually re
siding in Amador county, continue
to claim a residence here]! and come
here to vote at each election. In
some cases they have no interests
whatever here, and they evidently
desire to retain their voting place
here for the purpose of miugling in
the local affairs of -the . county. We
do not pretend to discuss the ex
pediency ,«f this course. Whether it
tends to help or injure the cause or
the candidates of their choice is not
for us to say. There seems to be an
erroneous impression abroad that
some who vote here are not en
titled to . this ritfht on account
of their former identity with Ama
dor; that the provision that a per
son does not lose his residence by
virtue of being employed in the pub
lic service, applies only to the fed
eral service. The provision of the
codes on this poiut reads as follows:
Section 1239 subdivision 2 of the
political codes reads:
2.— A person must not be held to
have gained or lost residence by reason
of his presence or absence from a place
while employed in the service of the
United States, or of this state, nor
while engaged in navigation, nor while
a student at any institution of learning,
nor while kept in an almshouse, asylum
or prison. *< ;■:£
This clearly shows ' that a person
holding either a federal or state
office, the duties of which demand
his residence elsewhere,, may retain
his residence in the county and pre
cinct in which he formerly lived.
The policy, however, of officious in
terference in behalf of any local
candidate by the office-holding class
who have no material interest in the
county may well be questioned.
It is more apt to injure than help
the cause espoused.

NEW SUITS.
C. W. Randall vs. James and Eliza
beth Toman— Suit for the specific per
formance of contract. The complaint
sets forth that about October 12, 1901,
plaintiff and defendants entered into a
certain agreement in writing,' whereby
the defendants agreed to sell to plaintiff
50 per cent of all mineral beneath the
surface of certain lands situated east of
the Summit mine,' near Sutter Creek.
Two certain actions, were pending in
the superior court at that time, affect
ing, the title to said property, therefore
it was agreed to ' employ "C has. W.
Slack and Van". R. Paterson as at
torneys to represent the parties to the
agreement referred to irrsaid actions
without cost to the Tomans. C. W.
Randall agreed to repay to the Tomans
on or before Nov. 10, 1901, all expenses
incurred or paid out by them in the
trial of said " actions, not exceeding.
$1000. * It was further agreed that the
party of second part ( Randall ) should
have 50 per cent of all mining proper
ties embraced in agreement, including
the ore taken, therefrom by any person
or corporation. The party of the
second part was to pay to the first part
on or before Nov. 1, 1902, $2000 of the
$70,000 purchase price, and upon failure
to' do so his right to "purchase a one
half interest therein should be forfeited.
Plaintiff claims that he has duly per
formed all conditions of said agreement
on his part, except that he has not
exercised his option to purchase the 50
per cent interest on said property, and
is able and willing to perform all other
conditions when the time for the per
formance thereof arrives, but that de
fendants have repudiated the agree
ment, and unless restrained by tho
court will dispose of said property.
Wherefore . plaintiff prays that the
agreement referred to which is not of
record, be adjudged in full force; that
defendants be required to execute a
deed to plaintiff for interest in said
property in accordance with said agree
ment, and that they be enjoined from
selling said property, and for costs.

Daniel Maunder, a young man 18
years of age, brother of Mrs. Arthur
Stone of Amador City, a native of Eng
lami, and a recent arrival from that
country, fell a victim of typhoid about
six weeks ago, and after successfully
battling- with the dread disease, pneu
monia developed while in a very weak
ened condition, and on November 2,
despite the efforts of skilled physicians,
he passed peacefully away; surrounded
by relatives and friends who had
ministered to his every wants during
the last days , ol his illness. Mr.
Maunder was'highly respected by the
many friends he had acquired during
his brief stay in Amador City. His
aged parents reside in England, and
they reluctantly gave their consent for
him to come to America and reside
with his sister after the death of her
husbaud, the late Arthur S.tone. . :
His remains were followed to their
last resting place, in the Sutter Creek
cemetery, by a brother, sister and
many sorrowing friends.

Catting Scrape.
A cutting affray occurred near the
Piccardo saloon, on the Jackson Gate
road, on Monday afternoon. The
parties were H. Bradley, who is en
gaged in the lumber business in the
mountains, and W. Gardiner. It seems
that Gardiner had been working for
Bradley in getting out logs and lagging
during the summer. When they met
Gardiner wanted a settlement for the
balance due him, amounting it is said
to something like $90. It does not ap
pear that there was any dispute about
the amount due, but Bradley wished
to defer tbe matter. Thereupon
Gardiner became belligerent, and the
pair came to blows. Bradley had his
pocket knife in bis hand at the time,
and used it, cutting Gardiner across
tbe abdomen, inflicting a gash that
would have penetrated tbe cavity had
it, not been for striking a rib. He also
slashed him on the right side of the
face. Bradley Yeceived a bruise in the
hand and also about the breast,
thought to have been caused by a rock.
Bradley gave himself up and was placed
in jail. It is not thought, however, that
the case will be prosecuted. Bradley,
who is a man well along in years,
claims to have acted in self-defense.
Bystanders interfered and prevented
the encounter being fought to a more
serious conclusion.
Bradloy was released yesterday, no
charge being made against him.

THE STAPLES' CASE.
Coroner's Jury ' inds that Mrs. Staples'
Death was laused by Arsenic Poisoning.
The coroner's jury impanelled to in
vestigate the circumstances of the
death of Mrs. Edna May Staples, as
sembled in Sutter Creek on Wednes
day last. Mrs. Staples, as has already
been stated in these columns, died in
Amador City on August 31, and was
buried two days thereafter,- uo sus
picion at the time being aroused that
death was due to other than natural
causes. Tbe doctor's certificate gave
internal hemorrhage as the cause of
death. When the husband, Dr. F. N.
Staples, left Amador, after hurriedly
closing his business affairs, and also
Mrs. Hoxie, the following week, ugly
rumors became rife that thn death was
perhaps caused by criminal means.
The body was exhumed, and the
stomach sent to Thomas Price, the
well known analytical chemist, for
analysis. The jury consisting of the
following persons. Jack Simons. C. E.
Richards, W. H. Hancock, E. E. Riehl,
W. S. Smith, H. R. Higgins, V. Brig
noli, L. Nixon and L. Katz, was sworn
and viewed tbe body, but tbe inquest
was adjourned to enable the chemist to
make a report of his analysis. This
report was -received from San Francisco
early this week, so the inquest was
held Wednesday, district attorney
Vicini being present in behalf of the
people.
The report of the result of the chem
ical analysis was not submitted tp the
jury, but the district attorney stated
that it was to the effect that arsenic
had been found in the stomach. In
what quantity was not stated, nor
whether the amount revealed by the
analysis was sufficient to cause death;
the simple fact that arsenic was present,
and that the drug veratrum viride was
not detected. The report was deemed
incomplete, and hence the district at
torney before taking further action
awaits more light on important points
from tbe chemist.
Four witnesses were examined. Mies
Minnie Hinkson, who waited on the
sick woman at the time of dissolution,
stated tbe circumstances of the death.
She was not present at the moment of
death. She was sent almost as soon as
the breath left the body to notify the
undertaker to come over from Sutter
Creek and embalm the body."
J. Danerl, the undertaker, testified
that he injected the embalming fluid
into the femoral artery as soon as he
arrived, which was not more than an
hour or so after death. Dr. Staples
told him that he had given the corpse
a good cleaning out befpre his arrival.
Dr. A. M. Gall testified that the em
balming process would not account fpr
the presence of arsenic in tbe stomach,
unless a bloodvessel had been ruptured
by the injection of the fluid. There
was no indications of this revealed by
the autopsy; no signs of internal hem
orrhage. The vital organs were
healthy.
L. B. Hoxie, the husband of the
woman with whom Dr. Staples is
thought to have eloped, testified to
certain circumstances bearing on the
case.
Tbe jury brpught in a verdict that
Mrs. Edna May Staples died from the
effects of arsenic administered by some
unknown person.
It has been ascertained that Dr.
Staples did not gq tp New yprk as 'he
announced his intentipn pf doing. . He
and Mrs. Hoxie went to San Francisco,
and were passing there as man
and wife. He started to practice medi
cine in the city. The pair appear to
have been wholly ignorant that sus
picions were entertained as to the cause
of Mrs. Staples' death, and the action
of the authorities here tp'prqye fir dis
prove these si|B[)iciqns. ' 'J\U<i\ -an item
appeared in the San Chroni
cle, stating that tbe body of Mrs.
Staples had been exhumed, and the
stomach forwarded to a chemist for
analysis. Dr. Staples and his companion
fled from tbe city. They left in an un
cermonlous manner. The doctor's
sign was not taken down, and one
trunk was left in the apartments oc
cupied by the pair. Efforts have been
madp tp locate ttimr whereabouts, hut
so far they (WYP proved, unavailing.

Another Catting Scrape.
Tho only disturbance deserving of
mention on election day in Jackson,
occurred on Broadway street on Tues
day evening. -It was not the outcome
of any discussion or dispute over elec
tion matters either, but was caused by
imbibing too freely of liquor. A wagon
load of voters from the electric plant
had been to Clinton to vote. It is one
of the absurdities— and certainly not
the least — of our local arrangements
for conducting an election, that voters
living at Electra, although within three
miles of a polling place, have to travel
from 12 to 15 miles to vote. In travel-
Ing half this distance they have to pass
within a quarter of « mile of two other
voting places. But. this is digressing
from . our . subject. The returning
voters passed through Jackson jon
their way home, aod stopped in front
of the Chicago hotel a few moments.
Some of them went inside. On re
appearing they found several others,
bound also for Electra, had taken pos
session of the wagon. There was not
room for the new arrivals. They were
ordered out, and forced out. A fight
ensued, and in the scrimmage a man
named Sidney Carter, an engineer at
the plant, was stabbed in the hip with
a pocket knife in the hands of Carlo
Luperani. Carter was also cut in the
back,, and a piece bitten out of one of
his fingers. The knife thrust it} the
hip cut a bloodvessel, and the blood
spurted out in a stream. He would
have speedily bled to death but for the
timely, arrival of Dr. Gall on the scene,
who .secured the ruptured vein and
stopped the outflow pf blood. The
wounded niqn was taken tp the Globe
hotel. H e U getting along nicely, « and
no serious consequences are anticipated.
The assailant, Luperani,' was arrested,
and is now in jail awaUipg examination.
Sheriff wept tp Electra yester
day and brought another man to jail,
charged with taking part In the affair.
Final Republican Bally.
The final meeting on the republican
side was held in Love's hall on Monday
evening. A fair sized audience greeted
the occasion, the seats being occupied
principally by the ladies. The Jackson
band was out to awaken enthusiasm
apd som,e giant pqwder wa_s exploded
pn th,o hill to create a furore and draw
the crowd. I, t hfts been pretty much
of an uphill work to get up any interest
in a political gathering this year, and
the final- whoop-up was no exception to
the rule. The meeting was presided
over by E. C. Voorheis as chairman,
who was introduced by C. A. Herripk,
the chairman of the cqu.nty cQtflmiitee.
One noticeable departy're fronj recent
pustom. was" the absence' of the usual
array of vice-presidents pq the platform
in the rear of the speaker. Phis was a
step'inthe right direction. The idea
of naming 15 or 20 persons to take seats
behind a speaker is one that might be
surrendered with grace.
After a few remarks by the chair
man, C. H. McKenney, present as
semblyman from thjg diatrlct, and
candidate for ' re-efectiori| was intro
duced. ' His speech was very brief. He
seemed much embarrassed, and came
to a standstill once or twice, and frank
ly stated tb,at he did qqt believe he was
making: much Qf an. impression^ la
conclusion h.e said he stood squarely on
the record he had made. He did not
mention the tnuch-talked-of justice and
constables' salary bill, but promised to
work faithfully for the district if elected .
J. F. Davis was next introduced as
the attraction of the evening. He
started in on the pp J qs,tl,tu,tiqnal amend
ments, andlgaYe his views as to which
sftoujd be voted up and which voted
down. He said a local paper had dis
cussed the matter in a wlshy washy
way, and his speech on the whole sub
ject matter was voted by a big majority
of his audience of a like slip-shod
superficial character. H.e, urged, them,
especially to. ™\e for the courts
o.f i^ppetjl, and against the extension of
the legislative session and limitation of
attaches.' His argument for th.a Jatter
was that It was unwise t£ take the ap
pointment of attaches from' the caucus
pf the'party in the majority, which se
cured absolute exclusion o;f unworthy
men, und confer the appointive power
on the Individual member. It was
nothing more than the argument of
the politician to be left alone In doling
out the patronage. The congressional
election was slightly touched u,p.qn, and
the assembly con^t defended
McKenßay in passing" the salary grab
bill, by saying that the board of super
visors and prominent taxpayers peti
tioned for the measure. ( The same
old story of "the woman beguiled me
and I did eat.")
The quietest, most spiritless na,tlo,nal
campaign ever \vitneisefl fn Amador
county was brought to a close with
cheers for the national and district
tickets. ..-,;'.

THE jIMADQR LEPqETI; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 11, 1904.
TRAINING VOICES.
Qnnrlc Mnslc Teachers and the Hun
They Do Pnplls.
"Ninety-five per cent of all vocal
teachers are quacks," said an old mu
sician. Few singers would doubt the
assertion. Probably in no other kind
of work can a man who knows practi
cally nothing about a subject do so
quickly a lucrative amount of teach
ing. There are many common types —
the piano teacher who cannot get
enough pupils to make a living, the
broken down old time singer, the dere
lict of the concert halls, who never
could sing himself, and many more.
Their half hour lessons may be said to
consist one-third of chat and gossip,
one-third of scales and exercises and
one-third of the singing of the pupil*
favorite songs, all interspersed with
just enough commendation and criti
cism to keep the pupil's good opinion
of both himself and of her teacher.
There are teachers whose training haa
not only ruined voices, but temporarily
harmed general health as well. Over
against* these charlatans of the profes
sion there are conscientious men and
women who. can detect faults in a
voice and knpw how to correct them
and who work carefully and enthusi
astically for each individual pupil.
It is not easy to tell the good teacher
from the quack, and you will find bit
ter early experiences in many a suc
cessful singer's career. — Leslie's Month
ly, i. >__
AN ARBITRARY TYRANT.
This Autocrat Exists Solely by th«
Will of the People.
And it came to pass that in the very
height of modern times an arbitrary
tyrant ruled over a great country call
ed America. The name of this tyrant
was Everybodydoesit, and all the in
habitants of the land bowed themselves
to his will. .. • . ";f;r:..
Terror of the autocrat caused grown
men and women to cast aside every
dictate of common sense — sometimes
of honesty as well. Children over
studied, wearing out precious eyesight,
cramping growing organs, yet mothers
whispered under their breath the name
of Everybodydoesit and the evil went
ou. Men bought houses and European
passages, automobiles and other ex
pensive luxuries, the cost of which was
out "of all proportion to their income.
"Evorybodydoesit" was the explana
tion they gave. _
Sorriest of all was the case of the
young girls. They patronized un
wholesome plays, read books produced
by diseased minds, they overdressed,
abandoned the gentle ideals of their
mothers' day and grew old before their
time. "Everybodydoesit," they said.
And thus it was in all classes of soci
ety throughout the broad land. All
men and women, young and old, recog
nized the sway of Everybodydoesit and
bowed their necks to his yoke.—Phila
delphia North American.
An Accommodation Train.
In the lake district of England there
Is a tiny railway which has only one
train run by two officials, one of whom
is managing director, ticket collector,
guard and porter and the other chief
engineer, engine driver and stoker. The
train stops anywhere. It frequently
goes off the line, but crowbars are car
ried, with which the train is persuaded
to return to its proper position. When
a friend of either ofllclal is observed
the train Is brought to a standstill. At
one time, when the managing director
was courting the daughter of a farmer
through whose lands the line ran, the
young lady would take her stand at a
certain gate every evening, the train
would be stopped, •and the young man
would kiss her good night
I.diik Widowhood,
In 1753, in the ninety-sixth year of
her age, died Jean Countess of ltox
burghe. She was not a very remarka
ble woman, but her memory is pre
served on account of her long widow
hood, which lasted seventy-one years.
Her father, the first Lord Tweeddale,
fought at Marston Moor in 1C44.
This Countess of Roxburghe's long
widowhood is insignificant compared
with that of a certain Agnes Skinner.
According to an inscription in Camber
well church, this worthy woman died
in 1400 at the age of 110 years, Tiaving
survived her husband only eight years
less than a century.
Be Just a Man.
Don't be a gentleman. Lincoln was
a man. Who ever spoke of the "gen
tlemanly Shakespeare?" Think of de
scribing Grant as a gentleman! How

INVESTING MONEY.
Be Sure or Tour Scheme Before Yos
Risk Your Saving*.
Don't tie yourself or your money up.
Don't risk all your savings in any
scheme, no matter, how much it may
promise. Don't invest your hard earn
ed money in anything . without first
making a thorough and searching in
vestigation. Do not be misled by those
who tell you that it is "now or never"
and that if you wait you are liable to
lose the best thing, that ever came to
you. Make up your mind that if you
lose your money you will not lose your
head and that you will riot invest in
anything until you thoroughly under
stand all about It. There are plenty
of good things waiting. If you miss
one there are hundreds of others. Peo
ple will tell you that the opportunity
will go by and you will lose a great
chance to make money if you do not
act promptly. But take your time and
investigate. Make it a cast iron rule
never to invest In any enterprise until
you have gone to the very bottom of it,
and if it Is not so sound that level
headed men will put money In it do not
touch It. The habit of Investigating
before you embark in any business will
be a happiness protector and an ambi
tion protector as well. — Orison Swett
Marden in Success.
BITING THE THUMB.
It Used to Be Considered a Pledge of
Mortal Revenge.
In "Romeo and Juliet" the servants
of Capulet and Montague begin a quar
rel by one biting his thumb at the oth
ers. Commentators have regarded this
act as an Insult, quoting the following
passage from Decker's "Dead Term:"
"What swearing Is there, what shoul
dering, what Jostling, what Jeering,
what biting of thumbs to beget quar
rels!"
Sir Walter Scott, however, In a note
to the "Lay of the Last Minstrel," says,
"To bite the thumb or the glove seems
not to have been considered upon the
border as a gesture of contempt,
though so used by Shakespeare, but as
a pledge of mortal revenge." >It 'was
thus accounted to be a solemn assur
ance that at the proper time tbe.sword
should settle the dispute or purge the
offense.
Something of the sort may have pre
vailed among the Romans, for it is
thought that the Latin pollieeri, to
promise, is derived from pollex, the
thumb.
PRISONS OF SILENCE.
Where Convicts Ever Wear Shronda
and Sleep Beside Coffins.
Entombed in a grim castle on the
outskirts of Lisbon are some of the
most miserable men on earth. These
are the inmates of Portugal's deadly
prisons of silence. In this building ev
erything that human ingenuity can
suggest to render the lives of its pris
oners a horrible, maddening torture ie
done. The corridors, piled tier on tier
five stories high, extend from a com
mon center like the spokes of a huge
wheel. The cells are narrow, tomb
like, and within each stands a coffin.
The prison garb is a shroud. The at
tendants creep about in felt slippers.
No one is allowed to utter a word.
The doors are unlocked, and the half
a thousand wretches march out, cloth
ed in shrouds and with faces covered
by masks, for it is a part of this
hideous punishment that none may
look upon the countenances of his fel
low prisoners. Few of them endure
this torture for more than ten years.
A Five Days' Love Story.
At the present time we are always
talking about the rush and hurry of
the twentieth century. Are we really
so rapid as we think we are? Cer
tainly few girls of fourteen have any
thing ■ like the amount of experience
and emotion in many weeks of life that
Juliet, Shakespeare's heroine, had
crammed into five days and a half.
The time is thus apportioned: ' On
Sunday the ball took place, and on
Monday Romeo and Juliet were mar
ried. On Tuesday Juliet took the
draft, and on Wednesday she was
placed in the tomb. On Thursday Ro
meo returned, and on Friday the hap
less pair committed suicide.
The Japanese Bnby.
The Japanese baby's head is shaved
in a curious fashion, and never, under
any circumstances, does the mother or
baby wear a hat or bonnet. Nor "does
he wear shoes, even in the coldest
weather, but his shaven head and his
pink toes peep out from the mother's
garments, and he rides pickapack,
strapped on tightly, happy, chubby,
smiling always and dressed, when he
ia allowed to get out of the binding
garments, in the most dainty of kimo
nos, all embroidered and painted and
decorated with the designs which *re
supposed to typify the final trade or
occupation of the infant.
Amusing a Boston Baby.
Mrs. Beanster— Mr. Johnson, won't
you please amuse the baby for about
five minutes? Mr. Johnson (not of Bos
ton)—l'm afraid I don't know how,
Mrs. Beanster. Mrs. Beanster— Just
talk a little. She always finds your
western grammatical peculiarities so
amusing. — New Orleans Times-Demo

His Mistaken.
"I pity the man who can't learn any

"Ah! You're always learning some
thing then, aren't you?" replied Knox.

FATE [OF A BIG OHIO TREE.
Slme of This Great Sycamore Was tha
Cause of Its Destruction.
The greatest tree ever seen by white
men in Ohio is believed to have been
the enormous sycamore, or, more prop
erly, buttonwood, which stood In what
Is now Valley township, Scioto county,
In the rich bottom lands of the Scioto
river.
tt was so prodigious in bulk that as
J*rly as 1810 It was described In th«
Cincinnati Almanac as one of the natu
ral wonders of Ohio. In June, 1808, at
cording to what seems reliable test"
mony, a party of thirteen persons, all
on horseback, rode into the hollow
trunk of this sycamore and found thai
room enough remained for two mow
horses and their riders. The tret
forked about eight feet from the
'ground, and It was hollow when flrsi
Been by the white settlers. The circum
ference of the trunk was about sixty
three feet at the base, and five fed
from the earth It was forty-two feet In
girth. These figures remind the reader
of the famous big trees of California.
The opening into the cavity within the
trunk was ten feet wide at the bottom,
nine and a half feet high, and the hol
low was about fourteen feet In diame
ter.
The account which has been pre
served of the fate of this enormous tree
Is very odd. It Is claimed that the gi
ant buttonwood was kept uninjured at
a great curiosity until the farm on
which it stood was used as a stock
farm by one Thomas Dngan. This
stock breeder turned several valuable
bulls into the fields where the huge
tree stood, and two of them fought in-
Bide its trunk. In that small space foi
a bull ring the victor was able to pre
vent the escape of his rival, and th«
weaker was killed. This affair con
vinced Dugan that the largest tree in
Ohio was a menace to his stock, and
he cut It down. Later hogs kept In the
same field were attacked by cholera,
and the owner reasoned that their hab
it of lying Inside the hollow stump was
bad for their health, and so he had the
stump removed. It may well be doubt
ed whether any other Immense tree
was ever destroyed because of a fight
between two bulls.— Cleveland Leader.

How He Protected the Seals.
Some years ago a Russian warship
was on special duty in Bering sea
guarding the seal fisheries, preventing
the slaughter of the seals during the
closed season. The admiral of the sta
tion in -the course of an inspection of
the vessel invited any of the sailors
who had any complaint to make to
step forward. One of the men, as
spokesman for the whole crew, com
plained that the "seal money" prom
ised them had not been paid. On the
astonished admiral Inquiring what he
meant it came out that the ship's com
mander had been doing a lucrative
trade by killing the seals placed under
bis protection and sending the ikina to
London and had taken the crew into
partnership. He was duly transferred
to Siberia.
A Hearty Farewell.
The old friends bad enjoyed their
three days together In spite of the fact
that tact was not a conspicuous qual
ity of either of them.
'Tft>u have quite a pretty place here,
John," said the guest as he took a
final look about him on the morning of
his departure— "quite a pretty place,
though it looks a bit bare as yet."
, "Oh, that's because the trees are so
young," said the host comfortably. "I
hope they'll have grown to a good size
before you come again. Then you'll
see how much Improved the place will
be." And they shook hands with mu
tual affection and good will.
He Knew the Natives.
A tourist, after visiting the Bine
grotto at Capri, was approached by a
fisherman who demanded 15 cents ad
mission. The tourist, • having no
change, gave him a five franc note
and got back a handful of coins. Look
ing them over, he said, "Padrone, why
haven't you given me at least one good
coin?" The fisherman laughed, took
back his Greek, Roumanian, Argentine
and. other outlandish coins and gavo
the tourist Italian money.

(bravely) — I knew it. But of course
you know the world doesn't know any
