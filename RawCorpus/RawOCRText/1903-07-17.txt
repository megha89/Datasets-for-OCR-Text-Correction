Immediately after the adjournment

On motion, the meeting adjourned to
Tuesday evening, July 7, at 7:30 p. m.
At the adjourned meeting of the di
rectors, the board considered the pol
icy of the operations at the mine "
The .secretary's annual report" was
taken up, and it was found that some
indebtedness had been incurred during
the time the company has been endea
voring to force the tunnel through the
exceedingly hard formation encounter
ed three months ago." This was not in
conformity with the settled policy of
the board. Letters were also read
from stockholders in the east, asking
reasons for not running the mill. These
were duly considered, and after full
and complete discussion of the situa
tion, and in view of the shortage of the
water supply, it was unanimously de
cided by the board to divert the ex
penditures from the cross-cut tunnel
for the time, and to start the mill on
what ore reserves were available; also
to clear up all outstanding obligations
of the company. The diminishing in

come from stock- subscriptions making
it impossible to run the tunnel econom
ically and do any other work.'it was
deemed that this course* would not only
satisfy the stockholders and" subscrib-^
ers, but would enable us to clear up our
obligations, and if possible, accumulate
a cash reserve sufficient vo enable us to
resume I the operations !at j the tuunel
later on, without, rendering, the 'com-;
pany liable to incur added indebted
ness.
The superintendent was therefore in
structed to begin at once the milling of
such ores as are in sight, and to stop
work at the cross-cut tunuel until the
water supply shall have increased, or
until instructed to resume by the board
of directors.

A COMMON CUSTOM.
Man's Habit of Rnnnlne His Finger s
Through His Hair.
| "Why does a man always run his
hnnd through his hair when he takes
his hat off?" asked an observant man.
"Did you ever notice that man will in
variably do this very thing? Is it just
a nervous habit? Is it vanity? It Is
an old habit. I liave never known a
man who did not indulge tills habit.
Even men who have no hair to run
their fingers through, . men whoso,
heads are as bald as billiard balls, will
brush their, hands over their heads
when they lift their hats. If the uieii
simply wanted to smooth their touslrd
hair, of course this would afford ample
explanation of the habit. But wliy
should a man who has no hair on his
head do the same thing? It Is not a
sufficient answer to say that such n
man may have liad a full suit of hair
at , one time and that it is simply a
matter of habit contracted under dif
ferent conditions. As n nile.nion are
unconscious of the fact. They do not
know why, how or when they run their
hands over their heads.. But they all
do it just the same. Go into n court
room or at any place where men cou
gregate and where it is necessary for
them to remove their hats nml watch
them. You will observe that every
man will go through the same perform
ance. It seems to be a perfectly natu
ral thing for them to do. , My own con
clusion is that it is an evidence of van
ity.- | A man wants his hair to be just
so. • Originally probably it was simply
a matter of tidiness. But it has grown
into an act of vanity. The lawyer, for
instance, if he has enough hair for the
purpose, will want his head to have a
tousled appearance. It gives him a
studious appearance and leaves the im
pression that he has been struggling
with the books. . Whatever the reason,
the ; habit Is a curious one and one
which seems to be deep rooted in the
masculine nature." — New Orleans
Times-Democrat.
Shipping; Cinnamon.
Cinnamon is so extraordinarily sen
sitive that great care has to be taken
with regard to its surroundings on
board ship, as a bale of very fine cin
namon will lose much of its delicate
aroma if packed among bales of coars
er bark. , Various expedients have been
tried to remedy this. The Portuguese
and Dutch isolated the bales by pack
ing them in cocoanut fiber or in cattle
hides, but it is, fouud that the only
real safeguard is to pack bags of pep
per between the bales.— "Two Happy
Years In Ceylon."
Just the Reverse.
"Th' boss don't allus keep his word,"
remarked the office boy.
"What's he been doln' now?" in
quired the stenographer.
"He told me when he went out this
mornin' . that he'd call me up on - the
telephone.' ' 'Stead of that he called me
flown for not answerin' " it when he
come back from lunch." — Cincinnati
Commercial Tribune.
Her Ultimatum.
Railway Surveyor— We are going to
run a railway line right through your
barn. - , .
Farmer's Wife— All right; I don't
mind. But you remember that I will

I have no intention of getting up after
that to open the door for the trains to

THE TOBACCO PLANT.
Its Orta-in, According to a Qnaiat
Legend of the East.
The prophet was taking a stroll in
the country when he saw a serpent,
stiff, with cold, lying on the ground.
He compassionately took it up and
warmed it i« his bosom. When the
serpent had recovered it said:
■ "Divine prophet listen. I am now
going to bite thee."
VWhy, pray?" inquired Mohammed.
"Because thy race makes perpetual
war on mine," said the serpent
i "But thy race, too, makes perpetual
war against mine," was the prophet's
rejoinder. "How canst thou, besides,
be so ungrateful and so soon forget
that I saved thy life?"
is no such thing as gratitude
upon this earth," replied the serpent,
"and if I were now to spare thee
either thou or another of thy race
wruld kill me. By Allah, I shall bite
thee?" ...,.: .... .
"If thou hast sworn by Allah I will
not cause thee to break thy vow," said
the prophet holding his hand to the
serpent's mouth. The serpent bit him,
but he sucked the wound 'with his lips
and spat the venom on the ground.
And on that very spot there sprung up
a plant which combines within itself
the venom of the serpent and the com
passion of the prophet.- Men call this
plant by the name of tobacco.—"To
bacco In Song and Story."
Win* and Temperature.
The wind does not affect the ther
mometer, as any one may find out for
himself by a simple test. Take two
dry bulb thermometers of exactly the
same kind and hang one of them where
it will be exposed to the wind and the
other where it will be sheltered— say,
on two sides of the corner of the house
—and after allowing^ them to hang
thus foria few minutes you will find
that they. register the; same. And yet
the person who stands near the ther
mometer that hangs in the wind will
feel the cold more sensibly than the
person who Btands near the sheltered
One. ■> r . '.■ iTJ . ■-■ .;. ■ ;- .-'
The wiSd is simply air in motion,
and air in motion is no colder than the
same air in a state of rest We feel
colder In the wind simply because- its
blowing over us takes the heat away
from the body by causing a more rap
id evaporation from the skin.' There is
no evaporation from the dry bulb of a
thermometer,' and therefore the wind
does not affect it . .
Thomas Carlyle and; His 'Wife.
As a ■ married couple : they were i in
deed to be pitied if the world ; had
known it. They Were childless, and
therefore half the world was dark to
them. 1 1 No man can be a "sage" who
has no children. A barren woman is
like half a story.-- Let her be ever 60
clever, so literary, so I witty, when it
comes to the essentials of life she is
open to the retort, How do you know?
And. .so )t was wlth-the_Carlyles in
their unsatisfying world of literary
eminence. Pity them, gentle reader!
When they shut the doors of their sev
eral bedrooms at night a mouse might
not squeak or a fly buzz but they
must start full awake in the blessed
dark and moralize, the one on eternity
and the other on ' Thomas. — London
Outlook.
Wagner as an Acrobat.
Ferdinand Praeger related an inci
dent of a visit to Wagner at bis Swiss
home. The two men sat one morning
on an ottoman in the drawing room
talking over the events of the years.
Suddenly Wagner, who was sixty
years old, rose and stood on his head
upon the ottoman.
At that moment Wagner's wife en
tered. | Her surprise and alarm caused
her to run to her husband, exclaiming,
"Ah, Richard, Richard!" Quickly re
covering himself, he assured her that
he was sane and wished to show that
he could stand on hia head at sixty,
Which was more than Ferdinand could
do.'
Frog* and Snakes.
The common snake is very fond of
water. Its food consists exclusively of
frogs and fishes. All snakes eat either
living food, including eggs, or creatures
they have themselves killed. When
pursued by a snake the frog seems to
be half paralyzed with fear, leaping
less and less powerfully as the snake
approaches it more nearly and uttering
feeble cries. If a stick be so pushed
through the grass toward a frog as to
imitate the movement of a snake the
frog will exhibit the symptoms of ter
ror just noted.
Contradicted.
"1 never -waste words on a fool," said
the pompous person.
"That doesn't correspond with your
wife's statement," replied a member
of the skeptical faction.
"What did my wife say?" queried
the P. P. ;
"That you were in the habit of talk-
Ing to yourself," answered the other.
True Gratitude.
At Wichita a woman passing along
the street with an armful of packages
dropped her purse, containing $750. A
gentleman found the purse and return
ed it to her. "Oh, how grateful I ami"
she exclaimed. And then she impul
sively opened one of her packages and
said, "Won't you have a cookie?"—

WILD ANIMALS.
Tbe Dealers Get Most of Their Llonj
\ From Nubia.
Dealers in wild animals get most of
their lions from Nubia. There the na
tives search for a lioness with newborn
cubs, kill the mother and bring up thfl
young beasts on goats' milk. When
Uiey are two months old they are taken
to the coast on the backs of camels and
shipped to Europe. Lions are also ob
tained from Abyssinia and Senegal.
Formerly the Atlas mountains tarnish
led the finest lions, but the species now
no longer exists except a few speci
mens ,in menageries. Adult Nubian
lions are worth $1,000 apiece, while
Senegal lions range in price from $500
to $750.
Tigers vary in price from $375 to $1,
500 apiece and more, according to the
variety and rarity of the animal. Si
berian tigers, for instance, sell at the
latter figure. They are large, beauti
fully striped creatures. In the winter
they grow a long, woolly winter coat
Some full grown tigers are captured in
pitfalls, but most specimens of these
animals are caught while small cubs
and raised on milk.
The hippopotamus, the rhinoceros
and the giraffe are difficult to secure.
It is practically impossible to capture
a full grown beast of these species, and
the young ones are hard to rear. 7 A
baby hippopotamus will drink thirty
pints of milk a day and a baby rhi
noceros almost as much. Thus it re
quires the presence of a large herd of
goats in the wilderness to snpply milk
for such creatures. A hippopotamus Is
worth from $2,500 to $3,000, a rhinoc
eros slightly more, while giraffes sell at
$2,500 or more, according to size, age
and condition. ~-i\~.
Jamaica Crocodiles.
«- There are a good many crocodiles in
the more distant reserves of Kingston
harbor and at the mouths of the Ja
maica rivers, but they are exceedingly
wary, and a most cautious approach is
necessary if one wishes to get close
enough for an effective shot
i Just as the lion has his jackal and
the shark his pilot fish so the crocodile
is almost always accompanied by -a
small plover, which perches upon the
scaly ridge of its back and is just vis
ible above the filthy water in which its
big patron loves to wallow.
■?" On the approach of man or any other
danger this tiny bird flutters into the
air and utters a shrill cry to warn its
"chum."
The crocodile dives, and you may sit
in your canoe and nurse your rifle for
an hour without a chance of a shot.
The Jamaican crocodile is shyer of
man than most of its kind.— Chicago
News.
The Dinner Honr.
The hour for dinner has undergone
several changes. About 1400 it was
10 a. m. Henry. VIII. dined at this
time and supped at 4. In the six
.teenth centurv.dinner_was atlLhreak
fast at 7 and supper at sor 6. In the
following century meals were an hour
later.
Disraeli tells us that in the reign
of Francis I. of France folks rose at 5,
dined at 9, supped at 5 and went to
bed at 9, which, according to a popu
lar saying, made them live to the age
of ninety-nine. Louis XII., it is said,
hastened his death by altering bis
hours to please his young wife. In
stead of dining at 8 a. m and going
to bed at 6 p. m., he took to dining at
noon and often sat up till midnight

pector. "I never saw the creature my
self, but he is described as hunch
backed, with a short body, large head
jfnd enormously long and powerful
arms. In fact, ' he I resembles an ex

is climbing the ladders by means of

raising himself with his long arms,

The Rattle as a Decoy.
That the rattlesnake uses his tall to
decoy birds has been observed a num
ber of times by a correspondent of the
Scientific American, who says: "The
snake hides himself, in the tall grass
and imitates the buzzing of a bee. The
insectivorous birds, such as the phoebe
and kingbird, are attracted by the
sound and become an easy prey for his
snakeship. I have seen rattlesnakes
concealed in the dense foliage of trees
twenty feet from the ground practicing'
the same deception on the birds and
getting the bird every time."

The Minister Finally Got the Source
of His Text Correct.

pulpit: "My tex' is 'Let de woman I'arn

mention of an unknown epistle a good

then again faced the audience. ' "In
spite of de interruption," he said, j"1
repeat de tex' am from de secon'. chap

the coat tails were plucked, and the
minister glared at the plucker, only to
turn once more to the congregation.

Real Doctoring:.
Doc Judson had never taken so much
as a. single course in medical' study,
but he was in greater demand than the
regular practitioner of Crowville, who
had a degree and a framed "dlplomy"
in his office.
"I'd ruther trust to Bill Judson's doc
toring than any that's learned out o'
medicine books," said Old Lady Sim
mons.'
When pressed for a' reason for this
preference the old lady had one unfail
ing answer. ' ; : " ■-■■■
"When Doc was away one time-I was
took with rheumatism in my side, an' 1
had to let daughter Jane send for the

an' said the rheumatism would give

weak as a rag. '-. -

FRIDAY JULY 17, 1903
COSTLY GOVERNMENT.
From official figures furnished by
state controller Colgan jt appears
that it has cost the taxpayers of the
state $10,446,773.36 to conduct the
business of the state during the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1903.
Beckoning the population at 1,500,000, 500,000
this gives us $7 per capita for the
cost of maintaining the state govern
ment. California has easily held the
lead as the most extravagantly gov
erned state in the Union. It is not
only maintaining its unenviable dis
tinction in this regard, but it is
steadily pulling further away from
all competitors. Without attempt
ing to give exact figures, we shall be
quite within the mark in saying that
this is fully three times the average
cost per capita throughout the
Union. • Truly, California is a big
hearted state. She prides herself
on doing things on a grander and
more liberal scale than other por
tions of the commonwealth. The
financial intoxication born of the
flush pioneer days has held sway in
governmental affairs through all
the years of statehood. The disease
has become chronic, if not incurable.
What hope of reform can be reason
ably entertained, when sessiou after
session our representatives are sent
to the legislature imbued with the
idea that their reputation as states
men will be measured by their suc
cess as raiders of the public treasury
for the special benefit of their con
stituents? That retrenchment is
the crying need of the hour they all
admit, but each member is fully de
termined that the cutting down
process must begin elsewhere than
in bis own political household ; in
fact, his particular locality needs ad
ditional financial bracing from the
public treasury to insure its sturdy
health, and the statesman's political
fortune. _. "v ;■ \
Our whole system is permeated
with the same prodigal spirit. To
the state rate must be added nearly
ten dollars per head as the average
cost per year in Amador county for
the support of the local government.
We have a total of $17 per head an
nually for government in Amador
county. The per capita for federal
purposes would materially increase
these figures, but this we will not
consider here, for the reason that
it bears equally upon all sections of
the country. Instead of applying
the brakes to this carnival of ex
travagance, the evil is growing more
acute year after year.
California is making strenuous
I efforts to gather population. There
is room for millions of additional
homes within her borders. Promo
tion committees are at work to in
duce emigrants to settle here. And
every argument of climate, produc
tiveness, and healthful surroundings
can be truthfully urged to induce
settlement. There is but one thing
that we cannot honestly claim —
namely, an economical administra
tion of public affairs. Is this the
one thing needful? * Notwithstand
ing the work of immigration com
mittees, the state is not growing in
population as rapidly as her re
sources would seem to justify. Many
homeseekers come, a large percent
acre do not settle. The question of
taxation is our vulnerable spot. The
head of a family seeking a location
is not apt to overlook this vital sub
ject. And the prospect of being
held up at the rate of a dollar and a
half per month per head for local
government is something new to the
general run of immigrants. 'Califor
nians are used to this style of living,
and think little of it. New comers
are not used to it, and probably do
a whole lot of thinking about it.
There is no gainsaying that the
most effective work that can be done
for California today is to climb down
from the top-lofty perch, and get on
common ground with other states.
Progress in this direction must nec
essarily be slow, but to make a
beginning is the hardest part of the
work.
LICENSE COLLECTIONS.
There is one branch of the county
revenue system that promises this
year to loom up well by comparison
with former years. We refer to col
lections from county licenses. Tax
collector Norman has been in office
six months. He has made two quar
terly settlements as license collector.
The total paid in for the half year
is considerably in excess of the sum
received from this source for a like
period in the history of Amador
couoty. For the first quarter the
receipts were $2433, and for the sec
ond quarter quarter $2553.50; mak
ing a total of $4986.50 for the half
year. This showing indicates a rev
enue of $10,000 for the year. Prior
to September, 1899, the license col
lections never reached $2000 in any
quarter. For Jhe last three years
of the preceding administration the
receipts, including the ten percent
commission allowed the collector,
were.-- as follows :^ 1900, $9102.50;
1901, 1 59521.50; 1902, $8818.50. ,Tbe
first half of the current year shows
an average of nearly $100 per month
over tbe collections of the preceding
year. This is a gratifying record. It
shows that the collector is diligently
and faithfully attending to this im
portant : branch of c- his duties as a
public officer.
The surpervisors will meet next
Monday as a board of equalization,
to raise or lower individual assess
ments as each case may require on
a proper presentation thereof. From
unofficial figures published in an
other column, it will be seen that
the .taxable property in : Amador
county has increased to the extent
of nearly $300,000 over the figures
of last year, t This is very gratifying
assuming that the raise is based 'on
an actual increase . in -'^property
values. We do not know what class
of property is chiefly concerned in
these augmented figures. We give
elsewhere a list of tbe principal tax
payers of .the county, which may
be of practical .value at this' time.
The smaller property holders, upon
whom the task of contributing their
semi-annual quota toward the ex
penses falls heavily, we are unable
to reach with such information.
This is the time for every property
holder to look up his standing on
the assessment roll, so that any
grievance he may have on this parr
ticular score may be presented with
in the statutory time to the proper
authorities for adjustment.
Board of Supervisors.
«", Jackson,- July 13. :
The board met as a board of super
visors, all members being present.
W. J. McGee presented a petition,
signed by the residents : of Jackson
Gate, ■ praying that the liquor license
of V.Gbilino be revoked, stating there
in that Ghilino conducted a disorderly
house, which was a disgrace to the
community. A. Caminetti represented
V. Ghilino. Several witnesses were
called and examined for and against
the petition. After listening to the
arguments of the attorneys the liquor
license was revoked by a full vote of
the board.
W. L. Fortner was granted twenty
working days further time in which to
complete his contract on the court
house and hall of records.

THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSO^ CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, JULY 1?, 1903,
A VOICE FROM THE TAXPAYERS.
Editor Ledger: — Will you kindly
give a small space in your paper to ex
press what I believe to be the senti
ments of a large majority of the tax
payers of Amador county. Maybe it
takes but little space to tell what tbe
ordinary taxpayer knows. In fact, he
is not supposed to knowanythingabout
county affairs, except to pay his taxes
when they become due. This is the
limit of his utility from an official field
of ...view. All the same, he is doing
some thinking, and the trend of his
thoughts is anything but compliment
ary to those who are responsible for the
present state of affairs. lam aware,
Mr. Editor, that it is getting to be a
little risky to think aloud; liable to
call for an involuntary visit to the po
litical house of correction, so to speak.
Conscious of this daDger, and yet
giving you full liberty to mention my
name to any inquiring frieods as your
judgment may dictate, I rise to remark
that unless there is a more economical
management of affairs by our county
fathers and other officials, there will be
ere long "only a fow of us left," out
side of our county officers, who will be
able to supply pap in the shape of
property taxes to meet the evor-grow
ing demands of Amador county. Some
thing has to be 'dono or this county
will be bankrupt.
X I was looking over the expenses in
curred and tbe bills allowed last month.
It made me feol like selling what little
property I own in this county, and em
igrating to some part where county
officials pay more attention to the in
terests of the taxpayers, and have some
regard for the people's monov.
.It seems to me that the offices of
county physician and health officer
ought to include all medical services
for the county, such as the examina
tion of insane persons,
Another thing, taxpayers don't like
to be called on to pay the traveling ex
penses of officials who draw a big salary
from the county every month, and can
well afford to pay their own expenses.
Another complaint that is in every
body's mouth is that tho supervisors
ought to produce sworn vouchers cov
ering every dollar they pay out for road
work. People want to know from the
published records the name of every
man that works on the roads, tho num
ber of days and wages per day. Let
every man receipt for his own pay, the
same as the employe of any other cor-
■ In conclusion let me say that all we
want is for our supervisors and other
officers to manage county affairs on
the same strict principles of business as
are applied to any well governed public
or private institution.

There is more catarrh in this section
of the country than all other diseases
put together, and until the last few
years was supposed to be incurable.
For a great many years doctors pro
nounced it a local disease, and prescrib
ed local remedies, and by constantly
failing to cure with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable. Science has
proven catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti
tutional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
Cure, manufactured by F. J. Cheney
& Co., Toledo, Ohio, is the only consti
tutional cure on the market. It is taken
internally in doses from 10 drops to a
teaspoonful. It acts directly on tho
blood and muscous surfaces of tho sys
tem. They offer one hundred dollars
for any case it fails to cure. Send for
circulars and testimonials.

An Unpleasant Experience.
Last Sunday evening Eugene Devan
and Arthur Roberts, two of Jackson's
popular young men, hired a swell horse
and buggy from Kelly's stable and
started toward Sutter Creek for a
moonlight ride. But their plans were
"upset," or rather the buggy, on the
grade a few yards south of the north
shaft of the Kennedy mine. The boys
do not give a very clear version of the
affair. They were either run into by
another rig or carelessly drove off the
grade. However, the buggy was turn
ed over a time or two, and the top and
body smashed beyond repair. In the
mix-up tbat ensued the horse's legs
became fastened between the spokes of
one of the hind wheels, which necessi
tated the sawing out of some of the
spokes in order to release the animal.
The boys luckily escaped injury, but
are rather "upset" over tbe unpleasant
ending of their evening's enjoyment.
Kelly was obliged to telephone to Sac
ramento for a new buggy top and
body. Of course this was done by re
quest of the young men in question.
Early Morning Fire Alarm.
At half-past 1 o'clock this morning
the night watchman, Matt Joy, discov
ered that the inside of L. Costa's black
smith's shop, near the National hotel,
was in a blaze. He at once shouted
"Fire," and fired his pistol to give the
alarm. The fire alarm system was ap
pealed to, and failed to respond, until
some one went to the fire house and
rang the bell. By this time the peril
was over. Jas. Mortimer happened to
be around at the critical time, climbed
through the front window of the burn

Getting Along Nicely.
Emanuel Garibaldi, who recently re
turned from a visit to his son Tony,
who is under treatment at the Chil
dren's hospital in San Francisco for a
very serious gunshot wound in the leg,
says that the boy is steadily progress
ing toward recovery. The X-ray was
called into service in determining the
condition of the wound. On June 27th
the main operation was performed by
Dr. Sherman, who cut out a portion of
the bone. The patient stood the ordeal
well, and has been slowly but steadily
gaining ever since. The father was
told that there was doubt that the leg
would be saved, although he will be
more or less crippled for life. The
surgeon says if he is able to get him
off his hands # in a year from now he
will be well satisfied. Tony bears up
choerfully, and has a good appetite.

FOUND DEAD.
A Miner Wanders Off into the Mountains
and Perishes Alone.
Will Bloom, while out looking after
cattle on the mountain range of tbe
Allen estate in the neighboorhood of
Wiley's station came across a ghastly
find. It was last Sunday morninsr,
about 11 o'clock, in the bed of the
south fork of the Cosumnes river, tbat
he discovered the partly decomposed
remains of a man. The circumstances
surrounding the case pointed to a sud
den snapping of tho thread of life from
natural causes. It was a wild and un
frequented spot, on the edge of the
river, about two and a half miles north
of Wiloys. Tho man had evidently been
attracted to this out-of-the-way spot
by the presence of water, and for the
purpose of slaking his thirst. He bad
divested himself of coat, vest, hat and
shoes, which article lay. by bis side.
The face was partly immersed in a pool
of water, and the position of the body
indicated that the death stroke seized
him while in the act of stooping down
to drink. Hunger played no part in
his taking off, for cheese and crackers
were found in his pockets, also $2.75 in
money and a bunch of matches. The
condition of the remains indicated tbat
death had taken place three or four
days prior to the finding of the body.
Coroner Huberty was promptly noti
fied of the discovery, and that officer
repaired to the scene the following day
and held an inquest over the remains.
The body was soon identified as that of
Frank Carveth. a miner, about 40 years
of age; The jury reported that da
ceased came to his death from natural
causes; probably heart trouble, as the
eyeballs were bulging from their sock
ets. The remains were conveyed to
Wiley's station and buried in that vi
cinity. Deceased has no relatives in
this county. It is reported tbat he has
a brother in Nevada county, also a
brother in Montana.
A brother arrived from Nevada City
on Tuesday, who had the remains taken
up and re-buried in tbe Amador City
cemetery on Wednesday.
The victim wasknown to many around
Jackson and other parts of tho county.
He had worked in the Zeila and other
mines. It is said that the last place he
worked at was the Sbenandoah mine,
beyond. He was addicted to drinking
at times. What led him to start off
into the mountainous where he met his
sad and lonely end is merely a matter
of conjecture. It is said that he had
worked in the mines across the moun
tains. - In taking his last tramp it is
thought his motive was to reach the
mines of Alpine county, or the works
of tho Standard Electric Company at
Blue Lakes. He was in Amador City
on the night of July 3, and was seen
around Plymouth on the 4th.
A False Report.
It was rumored about the county last
week that Gus Leverone and Vie Rocco
had resorted to the use of powder dur
ing their fishing trip to Silver Lake a
few weeks ago. The report became
current owing to the fact that several
dead fish were found In the lake after
the boys had left. This coupled with
the large catch that they made gave
rise to the rumor. County game war
den Chez. Arditto has carefully inves
tigated the subject and finds that there
is no truth in tbe report. He ascer
tained that several fish were carelessly
thrown into the lake by parties that
had been fishing at about the same
time as the boys from Jackson. The
fish had spoiled after having been
caught and were thrown into* the
water without thinking as to what the
result might be. Anyone acquainted
with Messrs. Leverone and Rocco
knows they would not be guilty of such
unsportsmanlike conduct, and their
friends are pleased that an investiga
tion was made, well knowing what the
result would be.
• The Ledger for Job Printing-
We wish to impress upon business
men and the public that tbe Led
ger office is far better equipped for job
printing of every description than any
other print shop in the county. Our
stock of poster type enables us to turn
out anything in this line up to a three
sheeter in a style and at prices that
cannot be discounted in the cities. For
commercial work of all kinds we can
not be outdone either in quality or
price. We buy our paper stock direct
from eastern manufacturers, and hence
are in a position to furnish billheads,
letter heads, envelopes, and such like,
for a very slight advance upon what
the blank stock would cost you else
where. There is absolutely no neces
sity, to send outside for any class of
printiug. We have this week added a
perforator to our office— the only ma
chine of the kind in the county/ This
enables us do stub work, such as checks
and receipts, as neatly and cheaply as
Uie same can be had anywhere. We
Hope business men and others will bear
these facts in mind, and get our figures
before placing their orders for printing.
To Owners of Mining Claims and Mineral
Lands.
The State Mining Bureau is at pres
sent gathering the necessary data for
a map of the mines and mining loca
tions of Amador county, and a register,
giving the owner, post-office address,
location by section, township and
range, amount of development work,
improvements, such as machinery on
mine and mill site, character of ore,
walls, and power used, depth below
outcrop, number of veins, width, strike
and dip of veins, whether patented,
area, elevation, and such other infor
mation not prejudicial to owners' in
terest. ■ ■■"•'■
The field work is now being done,
and it is quite essential that all infor
mation be sent in at as early a date as
possible. In covering the county it is
quite possible that some claims may be
pverlooked, and if owners will kindly
communicate with me at Amador City
I will be pleased to forward them the
necessary blanks to be filled out.

Sprionslr Injured.
Ed. Mills of Pigeon Creek met with
a severe accident last Tuesday and is
now under the doctor's care. While
doing chores about the place, he slipped
and fell, breaking the hip bone. Dr.
Tiffany of Plymouth was called and set

as possible, but it was a bad fracture
and it will be a long while before Mr.

misfortune.

Nourishment is the foundation of
health— life— strength. Kodol Dys

that enables the stomach and digestive
organs to digest, assimilate and trans
form all foods into tbe kind of blood
that nourishes the nerves and feeds the
tissues. Kodol lays the foundation for
health. Nature does the rest. Indi
gestion, Dyspepsia, and all disorders of
the stomach and digestive organs are
cured by the use of Kodol. Sold by

AMADOU'S HEAVY TAYPAYERS.
From tbe assessment roll of the cur
rent year we have compiled the follow
ing list of all taxpayers in the county
who are assessed for $1000 and over.
Where the individual or company is
assessed for this amount in more than '
ono township, tbe valuation in each
township is given. Whero it requires
property listed in more than one town
ship to make up the amount, the tax
payer is credited to the township where
the bulk of tbe property is situated.
In the hurry of going over the entire
assessment- roll, some errors have no
doubt been made. For all practical
purposes and comparison, the list will
be found substantially correct:

SUPEBIOB COURT DECISION -• *
ON THE JUSTICES' SALARY CASE.
The decision rendered by Judge Rust
last Friday in the mandamus suit
brought by James McCauley, as justice
of the peace, against C. L. Culbert, as
county auditor, to compel the latter to
draw his warrant in favor of petitioner
for $35 as salary for criminal business
for one month, under the provisions of
the county government act passed by
the last legislature, is a lengthy docu
ment, embracing twelve pages of type
written matter. We have no space to
give tbe full text of the decision in
the Ledger. We give, - however, the
leading points made in granting the
writ. The suit was contested on con
stitutional grounds; Ist, that the act in
question violated the provision prohib
iting increase of salary of any state,
county or township officer during his
terra of office. 2d, it is special legis
lation, in that it classifies the townships
according to population for the'pur
pose of grading salaries of township
officers: Tbe court saysi
That the legislature has the power to
change during the term of office the
compensation of township officers from
fees to a stated monthly stipend there
can be no question. Vail vs San Diego,
126 Cal. 35. Counsel in this proceeding
makes no contention against this rule.
In support of the issue of fact raised
by his answer that the salary provided
for by the legislative enactment under
consideration is an increase of compen
sation after election and during the
term of office of petitioner, respondent
offered in evidence the criminal re
turns of the justice of the peace of
township two, together with the bills
presented by such justice for fees for
criminal cases and charges allowed un
der the statute prior to the amend
ment, and for the months from June,
1900, to and including February, 1903,
and in connection therewith offered
the testimony of respondent as county
clerk and ex-ofiicio clerk -of the board
of supervisors thereof. These offers
were all objected to upon the ground
that they were irrelevant, immaterial
and incompetent.
In passing upon the constitutionality
of a statute the court must confine it
self to the facts appearing upon the
face of the law, and the facts of which
it can take judicial notice, and if the
law, as then considered, does not ap
pear to be unconstitutional, the court
will not go bohipd it and receive evi
dence to establish facts which-would
tend to impeach and overthrow the
law.
On tho other hand section 1090 of
C. C.P., reads: "If an answer be made
which raises a question as to a matter
of fact essential to the determination of
the motion, and affecting the substan
tial rights of tho parties, and upon the
supposed truth of the allegation on
which the application for the writ is
based, the court may, in its discretion,
order the question to be tried by a juryi
and postpone the argument until such
trial can be had. and the verdict certi
fied to the court."
Here we have an apparent conflict in
our law, but a close reading of the cases
cited in the rule in favor of petitioner's
contention satisfies me there is no con
flict, but that these are casos where the
legislature has clearly acted beyond its
authority in amending claims in the
nature of gifts prohibited by the consti
tion.
In the proceeding at bar the issue of
fact raised by the answer is deemed
controverted, and how can the court
arrive at a solution of the issue without
hearing evidence. If I could avail my
self of tho objections of counsel, it
would be an easy way out of the dil
emna, for it would end the case, but
such objection, in my judgment, can
not be sustained. The objections to
the evidence and offers of proof, so far
as they apply to the bills filed and al
lowances made to petitioner as said
justice of tho peace for the term begin
ning on the first Monday in January,
1903, and extending to the date of the
commencement of this proceeding, are
overruled, and the evidence is admit
ted. All evidence of these facts prior
to that time is objectionable, and the
objection as to that is sustained.
It is the plain duty of the court in
passing upon a statute to endeavor to
give effect to the expressed will of the
legislature, and uphold the laws en
acted- by it, rather than search for
means of evading it. It is not for the
court to question the wisdom or exped
iency of the enactment; that is the
province of the legislature, and the
law presumes, that body in the first in
stance passing the act, and the chief
executive in giving it his sanction and
the force and effect of a law by affixing
his signature, have fully performed
their duty, and given due considera
tion to such questions and also to the
constitutionality of tbe act.
Courts are not to review or revise
the ' legislative action, but to enforce
the legislative will; and it is only when
they find that the legislature has failed
to keep within its constitutional limits
that they are at liberty to disregard
its action.
In regard to the second objection the
opinion, after referring to cases cited,
concludes: I am therefore satisfied that
this act is not subject to the objection,
for the act is clearly a regulatiou in
proportion to duties of the compensa
tion of all township officers within all
counties of this class, and the legisla
ture was not prohibited by the consti
tion from so enacting.
The final question for discussion then
will be, Is the act an increase of com
pensation of the township officer after
bis election and during his term of
office. The evidence introduced at the
hearing shows that the bills presented
by petitioner to the board of supervis
ors for criminal foes during 1903 was,
$9.50 for month of January, nothing for
month of February, and no bill pre
sented for March. So for a period of
tne first three months of his term of
office petitioner only claimed as full
compensation for all services in crim
inal cases the sum of $9.50. And coun
sel for respondent contends that I am
to average the next three years and
nine months of petitioner's term of
office from these first threo months,

and from lit draw the legal conclusion
that the sum of $35 per month provided
by the act is an increase of compensa
tion, and declare the statute uncon
stitutional and void. In view of the
rules of construction heretofore set
forth, how can I draw any such con
clusion. How can I find tbat :the jus
tice fees for the next nine' months of
the year might not far exceed the Sum
fixed by the statute. -
The county government act of 1901
under which we are now . acting fixes
the compensation of justices of the
peace in a criminal action at $3 per
day, and in addition allows him for de
positions and transcriptions 15 cents
per folio. It can readily be seen how
few cases a justice would need to have
in a month to bring his fees above the
amount fixed as a salary by tbe act.
Twelve cases that took one day each to
try would be more than the amount.
Six cases that took two days each to
try would more ; than equal it. Four
cases that took three flays each, or
three that- took |four* days each would
exceed it. And add to this the fees for
transcription, and the compensation
under the fee system might double the
salary. , Under the fee system there is
no limit -to the amount he might re
ceive and retain, while in the act under
discussion the sum of $33 is in full com
pensation for all services of said justice.
A reasonable doubt of the constitu
tionality of a statute must be solved in
favor of the legislative action, and the
act be sustained. The constitutionality
of the law must be presumed. -...•• . „
Apply these rules to the above facts
and the conclusion is inevitable that
the statute in question does not conflict
with section 9 article 11 of our constitu
tion and is valid and within tbe power
of the legislature to enact. Let the
writ issue as prayod for. • ■
No action has yet been taken toward
appealing the case. The district attor
ney has been away for several days,
and when he returns the course of ac
tion will probably be decided upon.
We refrain from comment, other than
to say, that considering the interests at
stake, and the piece of transparent
special pleading against an appeal con
tained in this week's Amador Record,
we believe that public interests demand
that a question of such moment be tak
en to the court of last resort for final
settlement. '

THE SOUP PLATE.
A Seventeenth Century Cookbook
Telia Wlij It Was Invented.
A valet of Loiiis XIV. published a
cookbook in 1G55 in which be gives as
follows the reason for the invention of
the hollow soup plate:
The plates of the guests will be hol
low in order that they may help them
selves to as much soup as they may
want without being obliged to take it
spoonful by spoonful, because of the
r.isgust they may have for one another
on seeing the spoon go from the mouth
to the tureen.
Guests, it will be seen, used their
own spoons to fill their plates, the large
spoon to be used for serving the soup
not being invented till some time later.
Yet even a hundred years after the in
vention of the soup plate (1740) a work
on civility advised that all the dishes
should be so placed on the table that
every one could reach them with his
spoon and that If the soup was served
in a dish (tureen) every one should
help himself with his own spoon with
out seeming to be in a hurry. A work
on manners that appeared Just before
the French revolution deemed It best
to advise its readers that it was impo
lite to pnss the spoon' back and forth
between the mouth and the tureen.
A Plea For Descriptive Titles.
Setting aside the flood not to be
counted as literature, the naming of a
book that is worthy of a name Is a
matter of real moment. Two methods
seem to have been followed— that of
using the name of a leading character,
as "Jane Eyre" and "Rob Roy;" the
other that of giving some hint of the
nature of the book, as in "Vanity Fair"
and "The Cloister and the Hearth."
The first method has no justification.
What we plead for is that a title shall
contain the soul or the keynote of the
book. Then the author and reader
start on fair terms, i Jane Austen, a
consummate artist, understood this
well, as in "Pride and Prejudice," but
forsook her advantage in "Emma" — a
better book and susceptible to as tell
ing a title. It is difficult to estimate
what would have been the loss to lit
erature if "The Scarlet Letter" had
been labeled "Hester Prynne" and
"The House of Seven Gables"— a tltie
that has worked its way into architec
ture—had been called "The Pyn
cheons."—Dr. Theodore T. Hunger in
Booklovers' Magazine.
WeiKhtngr a Field of Turnips.
The English farmer makes use of
mathematics in his work, says a Lon
don paper. Suppose, for example, that
he wishes to know the weight of bis
turnip Crop while It is still in the
ground, which is sometimes a matter
of importance, a simple calculation
will give him the information.
It is the custom in England to plant
turnips in ridges twenty-eight inches
apart; this makes ninety ridges to the
acre. The farmer selects a row where
the crop seems about the average and
pulls up all the turnips in a measured
yard of the row and weighs them.
Assuming that they weigh ten
pounds, a simple calculation shows
that the crop averages a little more
than twenty-eight tons to the acre. If
they weigh eleven pounds, the average
will be about thirty-one tons to the
acre.
A Famom Emerald,
The emerald is mentioned by St.
John in his Apocalypse. An emerald
of inestimable value ornamented the
bezel of the ring'of Polycrates, king of
Samos. That monarch, having been all
his life favored by fortune, determined
to put his luck to a severe test He
threw the ring into the sea. The next
day he went fishing.
The record of that day's sport still re
mains unbroken. His majesty caught
a fine fish, and in the inside of the fish
he found his ring. That happened in
the year 230 of the foundation of Rome,
and the ring, considered as a talisman,
was placed among the royal treasures
of the Temple of Concord.
America's Largest Snake.
The largest American serpent is the
anaconda, which may attain a length
of thirty feet. It Inhabits tropical
America and Is a handsome animal,
with dark round spots scattered over
Its whole body on a groundwork of
rich brown. It is very fond of water
and haunts the banks of rivers, lakes
and streams, there lying in wait for
any deer or peccary which may come
to the margin of the water to drink.
Flower* and Scents.
Some flowers appear to change their
scents at different times. The com
mon Jasmine flowers when first
opened have a delicate, fresh perfume
which, after a time, becomes grosser
and attracts bluebottle files. Flowers
of the orchid Odontoglossum hebraicum
have a cinnamon fragrance and a haw
thorn scent at different periods of their
bloom.

PAYING TELLERS' ERRORS.
Those Officials Are V finally Heady to
Rectify Mistakes.
A bank officer, referring in a recent
address to the responsibility of paying
tellers, declares that the idea that such
officials were rarely willing to rectify
mistakes had little basis in fact. He
added: "How is it that there exists in
the minds of many the idea that pay
ing tellers are inclined to resent even
the suggestion that they make errors
in counting money? % I have never
known one who made the slightest
claim to infallibility. Who has not
heard the ancient and oft told story of
a teller who was asked by a person for
whom he has cashed a check if he had
not made a mistake? As the narrative
usually runs the self satisfied money
counter behind the desk is inclined to
become indignant and replies in a
pompous and abrupt manner that he
never makes mistakes. The consider
ate party then states that the amount
paid him exceeded that named in the
check, but j the teller still maintains
that there can be no error either way,
as he never makes mistakes. .
"Where is the teller who upon being
told he had made an error would fail
to politely inquire as to the nature of
the same? The inference is that tell
ers are possessed of so much vanity
and conceit that they lose the amount
said to be overpaid rather than ac
knowledge an error. How; unlikely
and ridiculous!" — New York Post
JnntTM yon Lleblg.
: Yon Lleblg was skillful In correcting
popular delusions en scientific subjects.
A notable example of this may be
found In the overthrow of the once
much discussed theory of "spontane
ous combustion," a comparatively mod
ern error, dating, it seems, only from
the year 1725, but which persisted long
after Lavoisier had explained the real
nature of flre, which was from time to
time put forward with success in the
defense of persons on trial for murder
and received its last support from
Charles Dickens. His success in this
direction throws a pleasant light on
the progress of civilization. One won
ders what would have been the fate of
Yon Liebig had he opposed himself to
such an error in the sixteenth century
when Kepler could only save his moth
er from going to the stake for witch
craft by satisfying her judges that she
possessed none of the signs essential
to a witch. In those days Kepler did
not dare to say that there were no
such things as witches.— W. A. Shen
stone in Cornhill Magazine.
Pnrenologry.
Phrenology is usually thought to
have been first expounded by Gall and
Spurzhelm and to be a comparatively
modern so called "science." But it
can be traced back to the sixteenth
century at least, for in a book pub
lished at that time by "Mayster Jhe
rome of Bruynswicke" is a profile of
a head on which are most distinct
ly marked' phrenological attributes.
"Imaginativa" occupies the place now
given on the charts to "Ideality,"
"fantasia" takes the place of the mod
ern "marvelousness," "estimantia" of
"constructlveness," while "cogitan
tla" is given instead of "hope." The
author states that the brain hath cells
or chambers, and each cell contains a
part of the understanding, and that
these parts may be expressly seen in
the figure of the head. Phrenologists
can at least disclaim against their
beliefs being newfangled. — London
Chronicle.
Hat Etiquette.
Tipping the hat is a rare thing among
men when there are no women around.
A few fine old fellows cherish the habit
of tipping to each other and to stran
gers when introduced, but ordinarily
the hand never touches the brim. In
business offices there is no sort of eti
quette. Men in the sweep and rush of
business have no time to give thought
to hats. But certain decencies should
prevail. On entering a private office
look at the head of the occupant. If
he has his hat on, keep yours on; If his
hat is off, remove yours. The removal
of your hat is a compliment and a
courtesy and does not indicate that you
are inferior or subservient.— New York
Press.
Her Age.
"Madam." replied the judge sternly,
"you must answer the question. What

"Gentlemen, have you any further use
for the witness? You may stand aside,
madam." V; ;■'
A Typographical Error.
"I've come," said the visitor, "to see

"I regret that error of the types

"Ah! Then you didn't mean to call
me that?"
"No, sir. I wrote 'robber* very dis
tinctly."— Philadelphia Press.

ROMAN HOT BATHS.
"They May Have Caused the Dovrn-
fall of the Imperial City.
When Rome was in her glory and
men were strong and women beauti
ful, they set first importance . upon
the bath. There were 800 public baths
in imperial Rome.
Before taking a bath the Roman took
a little exercise. In the later history
of Rome the room in which he un
dressed was heated, and after undress
ing he was anointed with oil. Then
came the scratching and rubbing of
the skin with the strlgil. Following
this perspiration was promoted by
heated air or a hot bath. The bath
was completed with a cold douche or
cold plunge. Finally the body was
anointed again. :"^i
It Is believed by many writers that
the Introduction of the hot bath in
the place of the cold bath among the
Romans' was the principal cause of
their downfall. The luxury of the hot
bath was weakening and destroyed
that personal valor and hardihood for
which, the Romans were notorious in
their earlier history.
. Little by little the enervating influ
ence of the hot bath gradually sapped
away the vitality of the Roman soldier
until the more hardy men of the north
found them . very easy foes <to con
quer.—Medical Talk.
Paaslnar of tbe Aristocrats.
The Revolution, in giving us a sepa
rate nationality, had not destroyed
time honored traditions. Our manners
and customs were English, bred in the
bone; our point of view that of the
mother country. Freedom and equal
ity were political terms that no one
dreamed of applying to social life.
What gave position at that time was
inherited distinction. Its possession
was free from self consciousness—sim
ply an advantage of birth, which that
Providence who had always shown an
affinity to hierarchies saw fit to bestow
on a favored class. The community
was divided by the grace of God into
gentlemen — and others; perhaps it
would be more exact to say gentlemen,
their servants and others. The privacy
of these gentlemen concerned them
selves only. There were no "social
happenings" heralded in their newspa
pers to force notoriety upon family life.
How It would have astonished those
early aristocrats if they could have an
ticipated the fictitious Importance later
days would attach to their privileges!—
Elizabeth Duer in Smart Set.,-, ,;
Oriental Jncrglerr.
An eyewitness of a celebrated feat
of oriental jugglery tells the following
story of what he. thought he saw a
band of Indian fakirs accomplish:
"They produced a chain seventy-five
feet in length and in . my presence
threw one end of it toward the sky,
where it remained as if fastened to
something In the air. A dog was then
brought forward and, being placed at
the lower end of the ' chain, immedi
ately ran up and, reaching the other
end, disappeared in the air. In the
same manner a hog, a panther, a lion
and a tiger were successively sent up
the chain, and all disappeared at the
upper end. At last they pulled down
the chain and put it in a bag, no one
ever discovering In what manner the
different animals were made to van
ish." :
Spanish Brides.
There are no bridesmaids at a Span
ish wedding, but Instead a madrlna
(literally godmother) is present with
the witnesses. There is no bride cake,
but there is a reception and very often
a feast after the ceremony. Before
the wedding takes place the bride's
new home is made ready for her : re
ception, for the boneymooners do not
start on their travels until the day
after their marriage.
Before their departure they pay a
polite visit to their respective parents.
On their return dainty sweetmeats in
pretty boxes are sent round to their
friends. No visits are paid till little
cards have been sent "offering their
house."
A Lightning Change Artist.
The rapidity with which chameleons
change their color Is marvelous. You
gather one from an outdoor shrub and
It immediately becomes dark, almost
black, hissing and with its mouth wide
open, threatening to bite. Meanwhile
it Is never still, but continues to crawl
upward whenever possible— up you, up
your sleeve, always upward. By de
grees the angry black changes Into
whatever color is nearest. If one's
dress Is of a brownish color so is the
chameleon's. . .

"Don't you think that people pay too

TIMING EXPOSURES.
A Work In Which Photographers
Become Remarkably Accnrate.
The photographer was about to take
a picture of a young woman. "It's so
dark here," he said, "that I guess I'll
give you about thirty seconds," and,
drawing out the slide and removing
the cap, he began to count in a meas
ured and mechanical tone, "one, two,
three,, four, five," ; and so on. When
the exposure was finished the sitter
laid: "You gave more than thirty sec
onds to that plate. You counted very
slow— l'm sure it took you a full min
ute to count thirty."
The photographer handed his watch
to the young woman. He said: "I'll
count thirty again. Time me." And
he made the count exactly as before
and he was just twenty-nine seconds
making it. "One second off— not so
bad. Near my old record, in fact,"
said ■ the photographer. "Ten years
ago, when I made more pictures than
I do today, I could by counting make
exposures up to live minute's without
being more then a second off. Usually
I'd be a second under; but, over or un
der, it was only by one second that
I'd be out of the way. .But," he added,
"this gift Is not remarkable. Nearly
every photographer has it. Nearly
every one of us can guess spaces of
time running from a half a second to
five "or six minutes with .what is for
all practical purposes perfect accu
racy."—Philadelphia Record.
Nature the Only Healer.
Medicine never did any person a par
ticle of good except by digestion, as
similation—going into circulation, etc.
No salve contains any healing prop
erty/except as a protection to keep
away the effect of oxygen in the air,
dirt or any foreign substance from
coming in contact with the part af
fected. The natural powers of our be
ing possess the only power to heal.
Anything that may be done to assist
in a natural way .is good— contrary,
bad. Give good food to make good
blood. Breathe good air, rest and not
overexercise to the extent of fatigue.
Then the body will recuperate. Then
the wound" will be healed by healthy
serum that is secreted to heal all
wounds, not the salve. The salve pro
tects from outside influence, while the
machinery within goes on with its
