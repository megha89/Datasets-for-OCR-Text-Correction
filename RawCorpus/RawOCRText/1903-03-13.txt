THE QUEEN OF SPICES
CINNAMON, DELICIOUS AND SUGARY.
AROMATIC ANP PUNGENT.
The DUcorery of Its Valuable Prop
crtles Antedates Recorded History.
Something of It* Uses and the Way
In Which It Ia Produced.
Cinnamon is in Itself unquestionably
the most delicious of all spices, being
sugary as well as aromatic and pun
gent Many thousands of pounds are
consumed annually In every civilized
country, and it Is also highly appreci
ated by even semlcivilized and bar
barous nations where culinary art and
medicine have as yet made little prog
ress. :-
Its uses In sweet cookery are innu
merable. There are very few fruits
which are not Improved In preserves,
pickles and pastries by the addition of
more or less of this delicate bark. It Is
an essential flavoring in all spice cakes
and In many varieties of pies and pud
dings. ■ In chocolate, confectionery,
candles, cordials and liqueurs cinnamon
contributes an Incomparable flavor.
Its medicinal .value is well known
as an antlepasmodic and carminative
and tonic. Its use Is recommended as
a preventive and remedy for cholera,
and In seasons when stomach troubles
prevail cinnamon drops are recom
mended as the most wholesome form
of candy for children.
The discovery of the valuable prop
erties of cinnamon antedates recorded
history, as It is mentioned in the Bible,
in the book of Exodus, as one of the
ingredients of the sacred oil with
which the priests were anointed. So
highly was the sweet bark esteemed
by the ancients that even a small piece
was considered a fit gift for a king. It
Is always mentioned as, an especially
choice substance by Greek writers pre
vious to the Christian era. It Is said
that the Arab traders, who first
brought it to Egypt and western Asia,
surrounded its history and production
with special tales of mystery, and
magic.
The clnnnamon tree Is a member of
the laurel family, which In the tropics
Is represented by a large number of
aromatic and medicinal trees and
shrubs.
There are several closely allied cin
namon trees, but the finest bark is pro
cured from a species native to the is
land of Ceylou, distinguished by bota
nists as Cinimmonium zeylanicum. In
a state of nature this grows to be a
tree from twenty to thirty feet in
height with rather large, oval, entire
margined leaves and yellowish flowers
succeeded by small, brown drupes re
sembling acorns In shape.. The grayish
brown bark is internally of an orange
color, which changes upon drying to
the characteristic brown which is the
recognized name of a particular shade.
Almost every part of the tree yields
some choice substance and Is especial
ly rich In oil. The roots yield camphor
and' the leaves an oil resembling the
oil of cloves and often substituted for
it while from the fruit a substance
called cinnamon suet is manufactured,
.which Is highly fragrant and from
which in former times candles for the
exclusive use of the king were made.
In the latter part of the eighteenth
century, wliile England was for a time
In possession of the spice Islands, cin
namon plants were among the choice
products that were imported Into vari
ous other tropical regions, including
the West Indies, where in Cuba and
several other islands It has become a
considerable article of commerce. Un
der cultivation It is not allowed to
grow into a tree, as the richest bark ia
taken from shoots of from two to four
years' growth. The young tree Is,
therefore, cut and shoots from the root
are encouraged to grow. The majority
of these are cut when about ten feet in
height and the bark Is detached in ten
or twelve inch lengths. After lying in
bundles for a few days the bark 13
scraped by hand, both outside and In,
until reduced to a thin sheet These
sheets arc then made up into compos
ite "quills" by placing the narrower
and shorter pieces inside and rolling
tightly, forming flrmrods, which after
further drying are made into bundles
weighing about eighty pounds and
wrapped for shipping. Grocers divide,
assort and j very neatly combine por
tions of these quills into small packets
for the convenience of their customers.
The oil of cinnamon Is made by
grinding the coarser pieces of the bark
and soaking them for two or three
days in sea water, followed by the
process of distilling. Two oils, one
heavier and the other lighter than wa
ter, are the product both possessing
similar properties. The color varies
from cherry red to pale yellow, tba
latter being preferred by most pur
chasers.
The work of distilling is ligbt, and
an oil equal to the best Ceylonese is
now produced in Trinidad and various
other localities in Cuba and other West
India islands.
As cinnamon commands a good price
and Its uses are continually multiply
ing, there is every inducement for ex
tending the area of its cultivation, both
in the eastern and western hemi
spheres.—St Louis Republic.
A Crisis Met Half Way.
There were Btrlct orders in the Phil
ippines regarding looting, and one day
a lieutenant's suspicions were aroused
by a private whom he saw peering ea
gerly under the piazza of a house on
the outskirts of Manila, writes Dixie
Wolcott in Harper's Magazine.
"What are you doing there?" he de
manded In his gruffest tones.
"Why, sir ' said the soldier, saluting,
"I'm only trying to catch a chicken
which I've Just bought"
Lieutenant K. stooped and caught
sight of a fine pair of fowls.
"There are two chickens under
there," he exclaimed excitedly. "I
bought the other one. Catch 'om both."

MENTAL TENSION.
Bard to Realise the Difficulty ot
Keepina; a Natural Pose.
We never know how active our im
aginations van be till we let them out
or till they get the better of us for
some reason. ' A major in the army
recently admitted that when he went
into action for the first time be was so
scared that lie did not know which
way was north, but be had an over
whelming desire to reach it, wherever
It was. Yet, after six or eight battles
and after being won:: J-.\l a couple of
times, he regarded battles very much
08 people berealKMit regard the evening
fight at the Manhattan end of the
bridge, says the Brooklyn Eagle.
■ Cases of wanting to run when bullets
fly are by no means difficult to find.
But a young soldier In Brooklyn con
fesses to n more queer experience. His
regiment was in camp and had been
ordered out for dress parade, as usual.
When lined up for inspection, every
man as stiff _ as a ramrod and not a
white glove moving, this young man,
'a lieutenant, began to ask himself:
"Suppose I should slip, or anything, to
break the quiet? Suppose I should
fall?" Tho idea of falling kept grow
ing In his mind till before the Inspec
tion was over and the regiment was
allowed to use Its feet once more he
could hardly keep on his legs and was
in a great sweat of agony from the
dread of tumbling over and making an
exhibition of himself.
People who have never tried it do not
realize how hard it Is to stand abso
lutely still and yet appear interested
and at ease. Artists' models succeed
nt it, especially those in Italy, and will
hold a pose not too difficult for an hour.
Actors, when they group about the man
In the center of the stage, who is en
joying all the limelight— and how they;
hate them for it— are required to keep
still, so as not to distract attention from
the great man's sayings and motions,
and because they must group in such a
way as to form a picture and keep It
till It can be realized by the eyes in
front But this enforced statuesque
ness Is hard on the supes. They are
not used to It When they are put un
der the strain, and when as Roman
warriors they must stand at the back
without winking while Brutus or Vir
ginius or some other ponderous person
unbosoms himself respecting love . or
politics, they are In a small torture.
One such last season who could no lon
ger abide it to listen to the soliloquy by
the head man pitched over on his face
and had to be lugged out by the arms
to the spoiling of the scene.
BabipN Never Get Senaick.
"Babies never get seasick. I have
carried thousands of them In my time,"
said an American line steward, accord
ing to the Philadelphia Record, "and
In rough weatlier I have seen their fa
thers, mothers, brothers and sisters
keel over like soldiers before a cannon
ball; but not so with the babies.
Whether It be rough or smooth at
sea, a baby_is alwnys ,nn. excellent
sailor— rosy, Jolly and with the appe
tite of a horse. ; Do you know tne ex
planation of this singular fact? It is
ns simple as the fnet is strange. Ba
bies don't get seasick because they are
accustomed to the rocking of the cra
dle. That movement is"much like the
rocking of a ship. A baby aboard ship,
therefore, is merely a baby In an un
usually big cradle, and there is nothing
odd to him about the rocking, for it is
what he has been accustomed to all
his life."
Capacity of Boxes.
A box 4 inches square and 4 1-5
inches deep will contain one quart; 8
Inches long by 4 Inches wide and • 4

Rainwater Good if Yon Like It.
"When a man gets used to drinking
rainwater," said a New Orleans man to
the Washington Post, "there is no other
water in the world that tastes so good.
Most of the people In New Orleans
have cisterns in their yards which hold
an abundant supply of water caught
from the clouds, the purest and best
in the world, according to my notion.
The winter rainfall alone is used, the
summer catch not being desirable. It
la somewhat curious that in northern
latitudes the cistern water does not
keep wholesome and sweet as it does
in our country."
Had No Time.
The Boy's Father — Madam, let me
ask if your daughter knows how to run
a house — can cook, for example, and
nurse the sick, mend clothes and, in
fact, is familiar with all the multifari
ous details of domesticity?
The Girl's Mother— Certainly not sir!
Why, If sbe had learned all those
things, her education would have been
negjected.— Judge.
A I'll ii line.
"Well," said Noah as he hunted for
a dry spot on the top of Ararat, "a lot
of people came down to the pier to Josh
us when we started, but I don't see
any of them around to poke fun at our
home coming."— Life.
How It Happened.
Judge— How did you come to club
this man so severely?

LOST HIS NERVE.
Wtr It Waa That Big- Pete Failed to
Hit the Sheriff.
There were thirty men in the White
Wolf saloon when the sheriff of Silver
connty sauntered in to arrest big Pete
Thompson for murder. Pete was play
ljifi a hand in a game of poker, and
after nodding to him the sheriff stood
up at the bar and called for a drink.
His j back was scarcely turned when
Pete laid down his cards, pulled hla
gun and fired six shots as fast as his
fliger could pull the trigger. Thesherifl
never moved. When the smoke bad
nlled out of the open door and we
epuld see, the sheriff stood in the same
position and wore the same smile. One
bullet had burned bis cheek; a second
hnd grazed his ear; a third had cut
through his shirt collar under the left
etr.; Big Pete was a dead shot, and
yit he had missed his man at fifteen
feet" .
•^t through, Pete?" asked the sher
iff, 'breaking a silence that was posi
tively painful.
"And you— you are not heeled!"
gasped Pete as his arm sunk slowly
down.
"No; come on." '"
. "You didn't bring your guns?"
"No; if you are through shooting,
we'll go."
Pete laid his two guns down on the
table before him' and walked to the
door and out into the street His horse
was tied to a post a block away. He
reached the horse, mounted and then
headed down the long street after the
sheriff, who was giving him not the
slightest attention. In five minutes the
pair were out of sight.
"What ailed Pete?" was asked of
{he barkeeper, who had come to the
door of the saloon.
"Lost his nerve," he brusquely re
plied. - -
"How do you mean?"
"Why, the sheriff coming withont a
gun and standing there to be shot at
took all his sand away and made a wo
man of him."
"Suppose the sheriff had had a gun?"
The man jerked his head toward the
field wherein fifteen or twenty victims
iiad been buried and said:
"He'd 'a' bin over thar."
"And will big Pete get clear?"
"Likely; but he'll have to leave here.
The boys have already put him down
as N. G." •

Not All Reformed.
At a dinner given by a philanthropist
to the Society of Reformed Criminals a
gentleman complained to his host mid
way through the festivities that he had
lost his watch. The host was a man of
great Ingenuity. He caused all the
lights to be turned out Then he ob
served: "Some one here has a watch
that does not belong to him. If by the
time I have counted a hundred it is not
.placed on the floor in the middle of the
room, the police will be sent for." He
counted a hundred, and the lights were
turned on again. Thirty-three hand
some watches lay in the middle of the
room.
It Was Bad.
The other day a young London street
arab, having found a bad sixpence,
was trying to make use of it at different
places, but to no purpose. At last he
went Into a tobacconist's and asked for
a threepenny cigar.
Ilavlng got the cigar and also the
change, he was leaving the shop when
the man called out:
"Come back here; it's a bad one."
"Never mind, sir," replied the young
ster. "I'll smoke it if it makes me ill."
And he bolted out of the door. — Pear

Girls Help Waiters to Cheat.
Among hotel employees sex does not
appear to make any difference so far
as honesty Is concerned, says the
Brooklyn Eagle. Certain young women
who act as checkers in hotels work
with certain waiters. Whenever one of
the girls obtains a position the men
soon follow her, and the hotel proprie
tor is victimized accordingly. The wait
er who is in league with the checker
makes a small private mark on the
check with which he desires to cheat
She sees It, and Instead of stamping
the prices against the articles ordered
she puts her fingers over the figures on
the die so that a slight blotch is all
that is recorded in the place for figures.
The waiter does the rest She. keeps
her account against her confederates,

the Idl. Bon.
It is human nature to take it easy
when we can, and with most people a
big bank account will paralyse effort
and destroy ambition. Who can tell
what would have been the , effect on
our national blsfory bad Abraham Lin
coln been born In luxury, surrounded
with great libraries, free to the multi
form advantages of . schools, college*
and . universities, the manifold . oppor
tunities for culture that wealth be
stows? Who shall say whether the ab
sence of all incentive to effort might
not have smothered such a genius?
What wealthy, city bred youth of to
day, glutted with opportunities for ac
quiring knowledge, can feel that hun
ger for books, that thirst for knowledge
that spurred Lincoln to scour the wil
derness for many miles to borrow thi
coveted "Life of Washington" which
be had heard that some one In the
neighborhood owned? ■
What young lawyer of our day goes
to a law school or library with such a
keen appetite, with such a yearning f oi
legal knowledge, as this youth had
when be actually walked forty-foui
miles to borrow Blackstone's "Commen
taries?" .„; ■.._ , - ;
Where is the student In college or
university today who experiences that
satisfaction, that sense of conquest,
which thrilled Lincoln .while lying on
the floor of his log cabin working out
arithmetical problems on a woodes

enthusiastically devouring the contents
of a j borrowed book, , as If his eyes
would never rest on its pages again? . .
On. reading Lincoln's Gettysburg
speech and his second Inaugural ad
dress foreign readers exclaimed,
"Whence got this man his style, seeing
he knows nothing of literature?" Well
might they j exclaim, but their aston
ishment would have been still greatei
bad they known that those j eloquent
utterances that thrilled the nation's
heart had fallen from the lips of one

LAY UP YOUR TREASURES.
Wo Han Should Spend the 'Whole of
His Income.
la anyone too poor to save? la an Im
portant problem which the readers of
a London dally are at present attempt-
Ing to solve.- .The question la not by
any means a new one. It is one which
has troubled past generations, Just as,
in all probability. It will affect the gen-,
erations yet to come. .We cannot say
that this latest discussion of the sub
ject Is throwing much, if any, fresh
light upon It . .
In the first place, there is a diversity
of opinion regarding the term "poor."
One man, who derives an Income of
91.350 ' a year from private property,
fancies he comes under the category,
while another does not consider any
one poor who has an Income of $500 a
year, says a' writer In Leslie's Weekly.
It is manifestly Impossible to fix any
limit in a matter like this. Very much
depends upon the locality and the con
ditions and surroundings of the indi
vidual. An Income that would be
amply sufficient to Insure a family a'
comfortable home, excellent social ad
vantages and a good living In a coun
try village would mean many priva
tions and sore discomforts in any large
city.
On the whole, however, we are In
clined to believe that Max-O'BeU's
views on the point . under discussion
come nearer the safe and common
sense rule than anything we have seen.
"I do not care," he says, "how small
the Income of a man is, he should never
spend the whole of it, especially if he
has a wife and children. He should
at least save enough to pay every year
the premium on a good life policy. No
man is worthy of the name who does
not do this, at least, at the price of
whatever privations ha has to submit
to. .Some pleasure may be derived
from high living, but certainly no hap
piness."

REPEALING THE LAND LAWS.
The senate committee on public
lands has recommended the passage
of a bill now before congress repeal
ing the timber and stone act, the
desert land act, and the commuta
tion clause of the homestead law.
This wholesale restriction of exist
ing methods of disposing of the
public domain has been prompted by
the alarming rate of alienation of
land from the government of j late
years. The startling statement is
made that for the first three months
of the present fiscal year over six
million acres were filed upon. This
rate means thirty million acres per
year. Continued for five years this
rate would exhaust all the land suit
able for settlement now in the hands
of the United States. It is esti
mated that the total area of public
land at present embraces five hun
dred million acres, only a small por
tion of which is available for the
home seeker. Much of this is com
posed of rugged mountain land unfit
for cultivation, or large tracts of
desert land requiring a vast outlay
in providing irrigation to bring it
into arable condition. Under these
circumstances it is contemplated to
repeal all laws providing for the
alienation of public land, except the
homestead law, imposing residence
and cultivation for five years before
patent can be applied for.
Officials who are looking for a
jump in their salaries as the out-
come of the proposed new county
government bill, are likely to be dis
appointed. It is reported that Gov
ernor Pardee is likely to veto it if
it reaches him. Many of the coun
ties, like Amador, have provided for
an increase of compensation of vari
ous county officials, with the clause
inserted that the act shall take effect
immediately. This is done for the
benefit of present incumbents. The
governor, it is said, is not inclined
to brush aside a plain constitutional
provision by affixing his signature
to a measure so defiantly in opposi-
tion to the restrictions imposed upon
i the legislative body by the funda
mental law. It is really amusing to
note how interested parties chafe
when mention is made of constitu
tional barriers to this salary grab
business. For Amador county, it is
urged, that if the bill passes, inas
much as the taxpayers of the county
are the parties in interest, the mat
ter should be left in the hands of the
supervisors, without a recourse to
the courts. This is rich. It means
that the tribunal established by the
people to interpret the laws should
be ignored in this case, and a body
whose business is on an entirely dif
ferent plane should be left to decide
the issue. The proposition is richer
still, when it is remembered that a
petition has been circulated and
signed by the members of the board
of supervisors of Amador county,
approving the provisions of the bill
as far as they concern this county.
Our esteemed and scrupulous demo
cratic cotemporary also comes to
the rescue of the salary-expansion
program, by branding the McKen
ney bill as a good one, using the
stereotyped argument that increase
ed pay necessarily means better ser
vice and more competent officials.
; He swallows the "take-effect-im
mediately" clause also. ' So that his
■ better-service plea falls of its own
weight as far as the next four year's
are concerned. The officers are
already elected for that length of
time; the competency is fixed by the
moral and mental characteristics of
incumbents. How increase of com
pensation is to command better ser
vice under these conditions we leave
our logical cotemporary to explain.
The mere changing from a fee to
a salary basis in the payment of
township officers is not the most dis
couraging feature of the proposed
law. Viewed in the light of an ex
periment it does not amount to
much. But for our lawmakers to
arrogate powers which the people
have in express and positive terms
reserved, is a serious matter. And
to endeavor to urge them on in this
course by trying to create a wave of
popular approval in defense of such
unconstitutional methods is deplor
able. Well may we ask,' "Whither
; are we drifting?"
For a good potatoe try Caminetti's

| One law passed by the present
legislature, on the recommendation
of the sheriffs' organization, will
meet with universal approval. It
provides that all sales under fore
closure of mortgage must be made
by the sheriff of the county in which
the real estate is situated. This was
the system in vogue formerly. But
for a number of years, the law has
left it discretionary with the su
perior court to appoint a commis
sioner to do this j work, \ and J pocket
the fees. If the sheriff does the sell
ing, the fees must be paid into 'the
county treasury. In the course of a
year the aggregate of such fees will
run up to a considerable amount.
In the case of the Moore mine sale,,
the commissioner was allowed some
thing like $1500, and the county
treasury was not enrichsd to the ex
tent of one dollar. Had the sheriff
made the sale in his official capacity,
the whole of the fees would have
gone into the public treasury. It is
refreshing to be able to cite this new
law as indicative of a tendency to
reform the practice of diverting fees
that properly belong to the "county,
to the pockets : of private individuals
as a reward for political favors. l
COMMUNICATION.
Sacramento, Cal., Mar. 10.
Dear Sir:—
There haying been some criti
cism of Assembly Bill No. 846,
creating a salary for the payment
of justices of the peace and con
stables in Amador county, in crim
inal cases, I beg to call your at
tention to the following statement
of facts:
The bill was prepared and intro
duced at the request of a large num
ber of the leading citizens of Ama
dor county., I received a petition
from the county board ot super
visors signed by them unanimously,
in which the following statement "is
made: *
"That after a full examination of
your measure, Assembly Bill No.
846, reference to fixing a salary for
justices of the peace and constables
of the various townships of Amador
county, we do hereby endorse the
same, and trust that said bill will
become a law, as we deem it just and
reasonable."
. A petition signed by one hundred
and fourteen voters and taxpayers
of Sutter Greek has been received.
Among the list of names was that of
E. C. Voorbeis, Jackson Dennis,
Morris Brinn, and other well known
and prominent citizens from Amador
county.
From Amador City a petition con
taining thirty-two . names was re
ceived, including the leading citizens
and taxpayers:* -;-••-"»•■*•■■•
Without giving ' a lonfc list of
names or any further quotations, [the
extracts from private letters we
deem it advisable to omit in the
absence of any definite request for
the publication of this article. — Ed] I
think it is evident that there has
been a general demand that the jus
tices and constables should be put
on a salary. In arranging these sal
aries I have put them extremely low,
lower than those of any other coun
ties in the state.
I beg to call your attention to the
fact that out of the fifty-six coun
ties of the state, not including San
Francisco, twenty pay their justices
and constables .salaries in criminal
cases. In ' every one of them the sal
aries paid are nearly twice what
they are in my bill for Amador coun
ty, and if the difference in popula
tion in the several townships is taken
into consideration, the economy of
my rates is even greater. Taking
only the five counties with smaller
population than Amador which pay
salaries, Kings, Stanislaus, Merced,
Colusa and Glenn, under the Act of
1897, we find the rates for Kings, in
townships having a population of
four thousand, justices get $75 a
month, and constables as much. In
Stanislaus, townships having a" pop
ulation of over 2800 pay their jus
tices $70 a month, and their con
stables $90; in townships having a
population of from 2400 to 2800, the
justices get $50 and constables $80;
in townships ranging from 1600 to
2400, the justices get $40 aad the
constables $60. In Merced county,
justices in townships having more
than 3500 get $100 a month, and con
stables the same; in townships hav
ing a population of from 2000 to
3500, the justices get $75 a month,
and the constables $75. In Colusa
county, the justices get $75 a month
in townships having a population of
over 900, and constables as much.
In Glenn the salaries are the same.
Compare those figures with the
$40 given Amador justices, and the
$60 constables receive in townships
having over 3000 population, and the
$35 justices get, and the $55 given
constables in the other townships of
the county. The other provisions of
the new law are identical with those
of all the other counties in the state
paying salaries in criminal cases to
their township officers. '
I may add that a large number of
bills have been introduced this
session by the representatives of the
different counties which do not, as
yet, pay their justices and. constables
salaries, the object being to create
salaries for those officials. : '
1 In every one of these, bills the sal
aries are very much larger than
those I proposed. In San Bernar
dino county, for instance, in town
ships having a population of 2000;
and less than 6000, justices are to re
ceive $75 per month, and the sal
aries that I propose are to be paid
to justices and constables in town
ships of between 800 and 1000 inhabi
tants. In estimating the expense of
this new bill, it is only fair that the
present fees paid the justices and
constables, should be deducted from
the amount which they would re
ceive in salaries.
If this is done, I am satisfied that
the increased expenditure will be
very slight, while the increase in the
service rendered, and the character
of men who would be called upon to
accept the positions will be very
great, and will more than offset the
increased expenditure.
Iv preparing, introducing, and
passing these bills, I have sought to
carry out the wishes of the vast
majority of my constituents, and I
have endeavored to look after the
best interests of Amador county,
and to keep.tbeexpenses as low as
possible consistent- with-the''firsll

class service. The letters of endorse
ment which I am receiving from the
citizens all over the county, endors
ing these bills and approving of the
principle they represent, convince
me that I have made no mistake iv
supposing that it was the wish of
the people of Amador county that
their justices and constables should
receive salaries in criminal cases.
The other provisions of the bill in
relation to the transportation of
prisoners, arid the duties of the con
stables when sent out of his town
ship, are exactly similar with ihe
provisions affecting township officers
in the other counties of the state
where salaries are paid them.
'I therefore invite the closest
scrutiny of the bill, feeling that it
has .been carefully prepared, and
meets the wishes of the vast majority
of the citizens of Amador county,

Tom Clark, who has been living near
Middle Bar for some time, left for
Stockton last week, which city he in
tends to make his home in future. His
wife and family left Monday morning
to join him. Mr. Clark has been ap
pointed agent of the International
School of Correspondence of Scran
ton, Perm. His territory covers the
counties of Amador and Calaveras.
This school by a system of correspond
ence gives practical instructions in
almost every department of science and
art. Its ramifications extend to every
jitv and county of importance in the
j # jf. J^irkland, a commercial travel
er from San Francisco, and formerly of
Amador City, . was a passenger on Tues
day's "stage. He was sitting on the
rear seat inside, furthest the driver.
His position precluded hi'jn from seeing
the robber, as the shooting commenced
after the stage had passed the point in
the road opposite to where the high
wayman was concealed. He knew not
what the shooting meant until the
horses were whipped into a gallop,
about the time the last shot was fired.
The case of Jack Adams, arrested
for burglarizing the Jackson bakery,
remains unchanged. Although the
justice returned last Monday, no com
plaint has been sworn to yet. We are
told* that a complaint is in the hands of
justice Goldner, and that Mr. Cade
martori has been notified of the fact,
And that if he wished to sign it ho
could do so. He has not signed it.
What the charge is we have not learn
ed, as the complaint is not filed, and
therefore not a public record. A ques
tion has arisen as to whose official duty
it is to make complaint in the event
that the owner of the stolen property
declines to do so. Does this duty do
jolve upon the sheriff or district attor
ney, that is the point. It is well to
. have this point definitely settled at the
-outset. There has been a great deal of
talk about this case, not alone in Jack
son but in other places, and the pro
.ceedings are being watched with
jjoterest.
Argonaut-Kennedy Case.
The long drawn out legal battle be
tween th.' Argonaut Mining Company
and thi- Kennedy Mining Company,
which Kn3 been K-fore the stato and
United Slates courts for the past fight
years, was brought to a close last Mon
day. Tho questions involved has been
before tho United States supreme
court for final adjudication for several
mouths, and a decision ha-= been ex
pected nt any time for several weoks
past. Monday uflurnoon W, F. Detert,
who is the largest stockholder and
presidei-tof tho plaintiff corporation,
recciveil a brief dispatch from C. H.
Lindley of San Francisco, the leading at
torney for the Argonaut, substantially:
Argonaut-Kennedy decision affirmed.
Chief-Justice ivuderod opinion. Only
two dissenting. White and McKenna.
Congratulations. ~
Tho news soon spread all over towp,
and general satisfaction was expressed
that this protracted struggle was at last
ended. The vital point involved in this
controversy was concerning the extra
lateral rights of the Argonaut. The
mine.was located under the old law,
which did not require tbe end linns of
a mining location to be parallel. The
Argonaut north end line, and the Ken
nedy south end line are not parallel to
each other, and the Argonaut contend
ed that it was entitled to follow the;
ledge in its" eastern pitch by drawing
the surface lines downward in their
own direction. This, under the peculiar
circumstances, would make the Argo
naut claim widen out with depth.* It
would givo the plaintiff considerably
more ground at the depth of two
thousand feet than it had within its
surface boundaries. Actual mining at
the Kennedy developed the fact that
the richest spot of the mine was con
tained iv a piece of wedge shaped
ground involved in this dispute. The
Kennedy had taken ore from this dis
puted ground, and tbo Argonaut sued
for heavy damages for trespass. 'In
the Calaveras court the Argonaut won,
and was awarded about $60,000 dam
ages. In the supreme court of the
slate this decision was affirmed. The
United States supreme court was ap
pealed to for final decision. That
court has now settled the matter de
cisively in favor of the Argonaut.
Eight of the nine justices participated,
six being for the Argonaut. The
money judgment including interest now
foots up something liko $85,000.
' Tbe early resumption of work at tbe
Argonaut mine is looked forward to as
an important factor in the revival of
business in Jackson. It is not likely

Wine Shipment.
G. B. Arata, who lives several miles
east of Jackson, has made this season
about 2000 gallons of wine. The entire
product was shipped this week to Pat
terson, New Jersoy. It is found to
realize a much better price by sending
it direct to the east. The price paid,
free on board at lone, was 45 cents per
gallon, which leaves a fair margin of
profit. Indeed, wine-making at these
figures can be made quite a profitable
Industry in those foothills. He has
also distilled this year about 200 gal
lons of brandy from grape cheese, the
refuse left from wine-making. Two
barrels of this liquor he expects to send
east, where it brings about $2.50 per
gallon, which is from 50 to 75 cents per
gallon more than it can be sold for in
tho borne market.
Bobbery.
The residonce of Mrs. Anativio at
South Jackson was robbed last night
of $7.75. Two men were implicated.
The men knocked at the door. Mrs.
Anativio opened the. door, and the two
men entered. One took a seat on a
box and the other on the bed. She
said they had whiskers over their
faces, might have been a disguise, as
6he could not recognize them. They
talked for a few seconds, when' one
said "We want your money." They
then broke open two trunks and from
these took the money, and left, extin
guishing the lights before leaving. The
officers are endeavoring to run down
the robbers.

THE AMADOR LEDGER; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1903.
HIGHWAYMAN AT WORK
Attempt to Rob the lone-
Jackson Stage.
One Horse Killed— Bobber Escapes.
Messenger McConnell Fails to Get
a Crack at Him.
A determined attempt to loot the
lone s,tnge on its up trip was made
Tuesday afternoon. It was guard day,
11. E. McConnell, the well-known
messenger of Wells, Fargo & Co.,
being on the outside, sitting by the
driver. A large amount of coin was
aboard in the express box, bound for
Amador City, as the following day was
pay-day at the Keystone mine. The
exact amount wo do not know, but it
was probably in the neighborhood of
$10,000, as tho Keystone has probably
the largest payroll just now in the
count y — running 80 stamps. . The stage
was full of passengers, ten or twolve
inside. Dave Phillips, who has been
doing service during the illness of
Chris Hansen, was driver. Tho bag
gage wagon was ahead about fifty
yards with one passenger,, and a
heavy load of baggage. An ' extra
stage also well loaded was some distance
behind the four-horse stago. The
point selected for this exploit in high
waymanship was near the junction of
the Buena Vista and lono roads, about
a quarter of a mile below Miller's
station. There is a bend in the road,
also a culvert, and the driver gave a
crack of the whip starting the horses
to a brisk pace, just as a ritle shot was
heard — which was the first intimation
those on the outside hud that anything
was amiss. A lady passenger declares
however, that she saw the man on the
right of the road before a shot was
fired; that he called "Halt" twice be
fore firing. She said he rose from be
hind some loose brush. The discbarge
of the weapon bad the effect of start
ing the team to a furious gallop. Those
on board looked to find out the mean
ing of the firing. A short interval
elapsed between the first and second
shot. The highwayman was in plain
view standing in the open, on the right
hand side, about fifty yards from the
stage, wit.h his gun to shoulder, when
the second shot was tired. This was
proof positive that an attempted hold
up was in progress, and tho passengers
were anxious thereafter to keep out of
sight of tho man with a gun. Mc-
Connell waa armed with a sawed-off
shotgun, and as he was seated furthest
from tho would-be robber, with the
driver between, he was unable to bring
his gun into play. He saw the road
man after tho second shot, who then
had his gun down, as if in the act of re
loading. Realizing that-he was haudi
capped by position, he told the driver
to whip up the animals, which he did.
At least five shots were fired, two bul
lets striking the off wheel horse. One
shot took effect in the hip, and the
other- believed to be the last shot - pass
ing through the neck. Blood spurted
in streams from these wounds, but the
wounded horse kept going, until Mil
ler's station was reached, where the
stage pulled up, and a" messenger dis
patched to lone to convoy the news of
the crime to the authorities, and also
to bring up another horse to continue
the trip. The wounded horse diod
during the stay at Miller's station.
The news of the crime was sent by
telephone from Duf rune's station, over
a mile from the scene of the hold-up.
It was quarter past five o'clock when
the sheriff's office received the notice.
Sheriff Norman and deputy Jackson
immediately started out, and in one
hour were at Buena Vista— fourteen
miles distant. At the scene of the
shooting, Jackson pickod up some
shells, supposed to have been discarded
by the road agent. They were of
30x30 size, the improved Winchester
weapon, of great penetrating power.
Smokeless powder was used in the at
tack, those on the stago perceiving no
smoke during the shooting.
No clear description of the shooter
can be given. Mr. McNichols, one
of the passengers, says he had a
good view of him as he stood with
his gun to his shoulder as he was
about to fire the second time. He
wore a black mask over his face. It
looked similar to those used at mas
querades. He thought he was under
rather than over medium height, and
from general appearance was quite
young. Others say he was covered to
his waist with a black covering. In
the excitement and peril of the moment
no ono was disposed to take a critical
view for the purpose of identification.
While the fusilado of shots was in
progress, ho kopt running, following
the horses, till they were out of sight
by the turn of the road. The fact that
the stago was not stopped was bwing
to the driver lashing the horses into a
rapid pace before tho shooting. Had
they been going slow, it is argued, tho
wounded animal would have dropped,
in which event a duel between the
guard and the bandit would have been
fought to a finish. The shotgun
carried by guard McConnell was useful
at short range, two or three hundred
yards. The pace of the horses put him
out of range in a few seconds, while as
far as carrying power is concerned, tho
rifle in tho hands of the desperado
would carry a mile.
Mrs Soboy and her 13-year old boy
were on the front seat inside, with
backs to tbo driver. Their position
commanded the best view of the out
law's operations.
It was discovered Wednesday morn
ing that one of the lead horses was
struck by a bullet, the misslo just
grazing the top of his neck, producing
a slight flesh wound. Also, both bridle
reins of wheel horeo that was killed
were pierced by a bullet; the check
rein between the two loaders was per
forated. All these marks on the bar
might possibly have been made by one
rifle ball. The shooter may be a green
horn in stage-robbing, but his work
speaks for itself as to his expertnoss
with a gun. The first shot, It is now
thought, was aimed at the nearest
horse's head, and it parsed through
the reins only an inch or two below the
mark.
There is considerable chapparel on
the low hills iv the vicinity of the shoot
ing. It was probably on this account
that the particular spot was selected.
It reaches away toward Buena Vista r
and affordod near shelter. A man
hiding therein could not be easily fol
lowed. All the circumstances point to
a novice in the. hold-up line being
the perpetrator. It was a bright
moonlight night, which added to the'
risk of capture.
Some spom to think that the first
shot was aimed at those outside, as the
driver heard the whiz of the rifle ball
Four discarded shells were found in
the vicinity. They were soveral yards
apart, the distance between the first
and last shell was about fifty feet. Sher
iff Norman and deputy Jackson found
foot tracks from where the outlaw shot
to the top of a hill nrur by, which com
manded a view of -the road as far as
Miller's station. From there the tracks
led through the brush in a southerly
direction toward Jackson valley. .The
tracks were followed by the officers for
miles. Boyond the empty shells, tho
robber, left nothing behind him, and
there is nothing to indicate that more
than ono man is implicated in the
affair. Sheriff Norman returned home
Thursday night. . Deputy sheriff Jack
son and constables are still actively en
gaged in the work of- trying- to run
down the perpetrator.

tion. Formerly it was worked princi
pally for silver, and whon tho freo silver
campaign was on, the peoplo of that
region wont in for tho white metal with
as much vim as anywhere. But the
defeat of the free silver craze has
proved a great blessing. Tho mining
interest is in a much better shape than
ever before. They have turned thoir
attention to the gold in the ores,' with
the result that tho country is moro
prosperous than at any timo beforo in
its history. Fifteen or twonty» years

road taps this country, and has made
it what it is. This was Mr. Johns'
first visit to Amador county, and what
impressed him more than any thing else
was the fact that such a centro of pop
ulation and industry as Jackson should
be without railroad facilities. Mr.
Johns left Tuesday morning.
LOCAL MINING NEWS
Notes From Amador County Mines.
Miners Busy at Volcano.
Kennedy. — Twenty stamps of, the
new mill are completed, and ready to
start up at any time. Wiring the mill
for electric 'power and lighting has
been in progress this week.- Rock is
being dumped into the ore bins. It is
expected that the twenty stamps will
be set In motion early next week.
Volcano Gravel Mines.— There
is an abundance of water for mining
purposes around Volcano. The miners
are taking advantage of this, and push
ing hydraulic work. Three claims are
in operation, under the management of
tho Baroni Bros., Gillick &Canvln, and
Marsino Bros, respectively.
Sargent.— The parties who were
working this property ' under a bond
have surrendered.it to tbe owners. It
is understood that nothing more will
be done under the bond. The cause of
the quitting was probably due to an
unwillingness to meet the obligations
of the bond on the developments made.
' Zeila.— This mine is expected to 're
sume mining operations early next
.week. Some delay has been caused by
making some needed changes to hoist
ing machinery. The large flywheel,
which has done service ever since the
reopening of the mine, has been super
seded by one of smaller dimensions.
The discarded wheel weighs three tons;
the new wheel weighs one half that
amount. A new clutch and now pinion
have also been put in. .The shaft and
machinery is in better shape now than
at any time for many years. It is
thought that several years of steady
working will elapse before a shut down
for shaft repairs will be imperative.
The machinery was expected to be in
running order last Wednesday night.
It will take a couple of days to take the
water out of the shaft. - ' The beginning
of next week the mill will probably be
started.
Edinburgh.— The new hoist on this
property is completed. Sinking oper
ations will be started at once, and con
tinued night and day until 200 feet is
attained.
Important Point Involved
Judge Rust went over to San An
dreas Monday to try an important
mining case, involving the title to the
Fellowcraft mine in the townsite of San
Andreas. The point in issue is whether
a townsite patent can under any circum
stances give any title whatever to a
known mining claim existing within the
boundaries of the townsite. The
Fellowcraft mine, it is alleged, • was
located as a mining claim prior to the
townsite. The locator, however, inter
posed no ' objection to the townsite
covering his property, and accepted the
title under the townsite location. The
annual assessment was not kept up,
and : the claim, ; was jumped for non
performance of assessment. The con
test Is now on to decide whether' the
original locator or the relocator shall
hold the property. Eminent attorneys
have.jbeen engaged on each side, and it
is believed that whichever way the
court holds, the case will bo appealed
to the, higher courts for final decision.

THE OLD RELIABLE
POWDER
Absolutely Pure
THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE
The Miners' Union.
A special meeting of Jackson Miners'
Union No. 115 was held in their hall on
Court street on Thursday evening of
last week. A committee was appointed
some time ago to endeavor to obtain
recognition of the union by the various
mine owners operating in Amador
county. This special meeting was
called to receive the report of this com
mittee. The statement was made that
an agreement had been entered into
with M. J. McDonald, the owner of the
Keystone mine at Amador City, to the
effect that no distinction would be
made either for or against union men
in that mine. An arbitration com
mittee has been appointed to endeavor
to arrange with other mine owners in
the county. What effect this will have
upon the mining industry of Amador
county remains to be seen. The fact
of it is, this union was organized in a
spirit of hostility to employers. It
started out on the theory that the
mine owners were legalized robbers,
and by the sheer force of numbers they
proposed to change the condition of
affairs. .JJow, they have wisely
changed their tactics, and hold out the
olive branch of peace. Threats and
intimidation have not worked as they
anticipated, so the attempt is made to
conceal the claws under the velvet
paws.
A committee of the union, consisting
of Messrs W. P. Evarts, H. Gobish
and Rattovich, .waited upon superin
tendent W, F. Detert at the Zeila office
last Monday, presumably, to secure
recognition of the union in some way.
Mr. Detert stated that he could not
speak for the companies in which he
was interested, but individually he was
opposed to coercion in any form. The
meeting left the situation unchanged. \
Champion Egg Eater.
The attaches of the Louvre restaur
ant were treated to an eye-opener in
the way of gormandizing one day last
week. " A fish peddler, having a load
of catfish for sale, appeared in town.
He was a stranger in this section. He
walked into the restaurant with a sack
containing eggs, which presumably he
had received in trade for fish. He
gave the sack to Tony Lubimar, the
proprietor, and told him to fry them.
Tony sized up his appetite i from ap
pearance as nothing out of the normal,
and thought he would give him ample
leeway, so he started to take half a
dozen eggs from the sack to cook them.
The stranger stopped him, and told
him to cook them all. Tony opened
his eyes in astonishment at this. He
was curious enough to count the eggs,
and found 74 in the bag. He handed
the entire stock to his cook, who pro
ceeded to dump them into the pans.
They filled two large pans. The
stranger got outside of the whole out
fit, besides side dishes in proportion.
He was not working for a wager either,
but simply eating for the love of eating.
Tony has been in the ; restaurant busi
ness for a number of years, and during
that time has witnessed some tall deeds
in the eating line, but this experience
far eclipses them all. After demolish
ing this feast, the man took his de
parture unconcernedly, as though he
had taken aboard nothing more than
an ordinary meal. -

Obren Spalch, a young Austrian 25
years of age, employed as skiptender
at a mine near Jamestown, Tuolumne
county, was killed in some unaccount
able manner on Tuesday last. The re
mains were brought to Jackson on
Wednesday, and the interment took
place yesterday under the auspices of
the Slavonian Benevolent Society, of
which order the deceased was a mem
ber. The brothers of the order, over
fifty strong,' accompanied the body to
its last resting place in the Greek
church cemetery, the funeral ceremony
being performed by Rev. S. Dabovicb,
who came up specially for that purpose.

PINE GROVE.
The adage that people who live in
glass houses should not throw stones,
taken in. its figurative sense, may. or
may not be true, but considered
literally, even philosophers will agree
as to its correctness. True as this may
be, there are good citizens among us
who do not always reckon the conse
quences of a fracture of this maxim —
nay, who do not hesitate to cast ivory
spheres with force at the object, or
objects of their wrath, and that, too,
in a place crowded with human creat
ures bent on whiling away a happy
hour around the green cloth with
cinches at 25 c
Moses said in substance — "If a dis
putant cast a billiard ball at ye be un
moved and let him cast twain."
But sportdom in Pine Grove declares
with emphasis that the means of retali
ation is to go out into the street,
gather an armful of rocks and clean
out the house.
The lights in the business section of
Main street were turned out early and
abruptly Sunday evening.
One of our citizens is going about
with a sore head, but with regular
hours and plenty of open air he will
soon be all right. It is said that
another was seen to ride into town
early this week with rocks tied to his
saddle strings — presumably for ballast.

The Stomach la the Kan.
A weak stomach weakens the man,
because it cannot transform . the food
he eats into nourishment. Health and
strength cannot be restored to any sick
manor weak woman without first re
storing health and strength to the

digest enough food to feed the tissues
and revive the tired and run down

Malicious Mischief.
\A Volcano correspondent writes:
For some time past some malicious
person or persons in the town of Vol
cano have, for the want of something
worthier to do, been using the windows
of the Catholic church .as targets,
thereby breaking' the glass and de
stroying the property. We want an
end put to such base disorder, and if
such parties will not take heed of this
fore-warning, sterner means will be
brought to bear, and the place of wor
ship protected by those who are in
terested in keeping up the property.
A Bemarkable Cue.
One of the most remarkable cases of
a cold, deep-seated on the lungs, causing
pneumonia, is that of Mrs. Gertrude E,
Fenner, Marion, Ind., who was entirely
cured by the use of One Minute Cough
Cure. She says: "The coughing and
straining so weakened me that I run
down in weight from 148 to 92 pounds.
I tried a number of remedies to no
avail until I used One Minute Cough
Cure. Four bottles of this wonderful
remedy cured me entirely of the cough,
strengthened my lungs and restored
me to~my normal weight* health and
strength." Kerr's Pharmacy, Jackson.

A MONTE CARLO LEGEND.
The Story the Cronplers Tell of the
Wnnderlnjj Jew.
All gamblers are superstitious, and
some of their pet superstitions are now
ao old as to have acquired the respec
tability of venerable traditions. The
croupiers of Monte Carlo have an In
teresting set of traditional supersti
tions of then: own, most of which are
entirely unknown to the many thou
sands of visitors who toy with the
"tiger" in that gilded court of chance.
The most striking of these is the
story of the Wandering Jew, which the
croupiers believe as fervently as they
do that the bank will down any "sys
tem" that ever was invented. There
la one day, and one day only, in the
year on which the rooms of the casino
at Monte Carlo are closed— that is on
Good Friday. When the rooms are
opened on the following day, they say,
the first person to enter the "Grand
Nouvelle Salle de Jeur" is an old man
of venerable appearance. He wastes
no time; but, walking straight to one
of the tables, he places with the trem :
bling fingers of extreme old age a
piece of money upon a certain number.
The wheel is turned, the croupier's na
sal cry falls upon the ear, announcing
that the number selected by the old
man has won. With a bitterly savage
exclamation the aged man seizes his
winnings, throws them about him and
hurries from the room to disappear, no
one knows where
He la the Wandering Jew, and until
he can lose a bet at Monte Carlo he
must continue his wanderings. Get on
the "blind side" of any of the old crou
piers of Monte Carlo, and they will tell
you this legend. Have they seen him?
Of course they have and are fully per
suaded that the aged and mysterious
stranger is none other than the man
condemned to perpetual earthly wan
derings nearly 2,000 years ago.

A FEAST THAT FAILED.
The Story of it Raccoon That • Was
Not Served For Breakfast.
It Is* within the memory of many
people that the custom* of schoolteach
ers "boarding around" was the usual
thing In country districts. Although
a custom which teachers seldom liked.
It Is doubtful if many of them had as
hard a time aa a young schoolmaster
who described his experience in the
New England Galaxy for 1817. The
irticle was written by Leonard Ap
thorp, then an undergraduate of Bow
floin college.' The young schoolmaster
was to receive $15 a month and his
board.
From the flrst day I perceived that
I was at board on speculation and at
the mercy of a close calculation, he
writes. One day the whole dinner, con
sisted of a single dumpling, which
they called a pudding, and five sau
sages, which in cooking shrank to the
size of plpestems. There were five of
us at table.
A few days afterward, on my return
from school, my eyes were delighted
by the sight of an animal I had never
seen before. It was a raccoon, which
the young man, Jonathan, had killed
and brought home in triumph.' When
skinned, he seemed to be one entire
mass of fat and of a most delicate
whiteness. I was overjoyed and went
to bed early to dream of delicious
steaks which the morrow would bring.
Long before daylight I heard the
family stirring, and the alacrity of
quick footsteps and the repeated open
lug and shutting of doors all gave as
surance of the coming holiday.
I was soon ready for breakfast, and
when seated at table' I observed that
the" place of Jonathan was vacant
"Where Is Jonathan?" I asked, j
"Gone to market," said they. ■;
"Market! What market, pray? I
did not know there was any market
in these parts."
"Oh, yes," they said, "he Is gone to
, about thirty miles to the south
ward of us."
"And what has called him up so
early to go to market?"
"He is gone," said they, "to Ben hie
raccoon."- - ;■
An Obstacle to Piety.
A story told by a western congress
man Is about two brothers, Ed and
Jim, who dealt in wool at their home
in lowa. Jim went to a revival meet-
Ing (unthinkingly, the congressman
says) and "got religion.". In his first
burst of enthusiasm he told his brother
of how much better he felt since his
conversion and urged Ed to come Into
the fold. The latter pondered gravely
for a tune and then said: "Ain't any
doubt but what religion's a good tiling,
and I'm glad yon've got It, Jim, but I
guess you better let me alone Just
how," he continued reflectively. "You
see, Jim, one of us has got to weigh the
wool."

STEERAGE PASSENGERS.
Immigrants For America Are Looked
Upon as Cargo.
One or the biggest liners sailing out
>r France, with 800 steerage passen
jers aboard, was selected for observing
the manner of handling steerage pas
sengers bound for America.
A firm conclusion reached after the
experience of that trip is that an Immi
grant of this class has to put up with
uuch unnecessarily unpleasant treat
ment—first simply because be Is an
Immigrant and therefore in judgment
meriting It and, secondly, because, be
ing what he Is, he baa not yet learned
10 protect himself. The picture con
jured up by the term 'Immigrant" In
the minds of those who have their core'
m route is not at all the color of the
Hslon that arises before us with the
word. Here In America we have* a
notion of a band of earnest and, It may
be, if we are uncharitable, worn and
unwashed men and women with fam
ilies, though the family and the wash
ing are really outside for the moment
Uurrying from hard conditions of life —
leant underpaid labor, ignorance, op
pression, misrule—pressing on to what
they must conceive to be a bright land
of promise or they would not be rush-
Ing here; to a glorious young country,
where all men are free and equal and
all that sort of thing. But the man
who has to see that these Immigrants
are given food and bunk and that they
do not fall ' sick below has no such
fancies. His sympathy, he will tell
you, Is not for the Immigrants, but for
the country that Is to get them.
Those In charge of the Immigrant
from southern Europe will tell you thai
he is not a desirable creature. They
have handled many, many thousands
of his kind, and they should know
something of him now. The company
transports him, It Is true, but as to
that be Is freight; freight of good
profit The company would take freight
to the highest degree distasteful if so
be the rates were paid. Indeed, yes. It
is a business. There is a large profit in
the Immigrant— oh, yes— but as a fel
low passenger he Is— oh, well, repul
sive, repugnant or whatever you say In
your language.— James B. Connolly In
Scribner's.
CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.
A German Hotel Keeper's Opinions
on . Hotheaded Peoples.
"I think that the Americans are alto
gether too quick to pick a quarrel,"
said a German hotel keeper In Harlem
who had Just had a petty tussle in put
ting out an unwelcome customer.
"They are not to be compared with
the French," said an American lawyer
who happened to drop In. "Why, you
know about those French apprentices,
how they are always ready to fight
and often lose their lives over a few
wordst." • -vv.':.~
"I've heard about theso apprentices,"
said the German. "We have them In
our country. They roam around the
country. But what of that?'
"Yes," was the answer. "A party of
them, with a leader and representing
some craft will, for Instance, meet an
other party of apprentices. They are
organized into different societies, each
intensely jealous of the other, and If
two such bands are different societies
there is a fight in an instant. First the
leaders come to blows, and then the
melee becomes general. They fight
with flsts and sticks until the road is
Uttered with the wounded and some
times the dead."
The German, not to be outdone by
the French, said before he had thought
twice:, "That's nothing. Why, our stu
dents In the - universities have fights.
They belong to different societies and
fight with sabers. Because of some lit
tle Insult often one will have his head
fairly cut open."
"And yet yon complain about the
Americans!" said the lawyer as he
laughed to see how the German had
stepped Into his own trap.— New York
Tribune.
A True Friend.
It takes a great soul to be a true
friend— a large, catholic, steadfast and
loving spirit One must forgive much,
forget much, forbear much. It costs to
be a friend or to have a friend. There
is nothing else In life except mother
hood that costs so much. It not only
costs time, affection, strength, patience,
love— sometimes a man must even lay
down his life for his friends. There Is
no true friendship without self abnega
tion, self sacrifice.

PAROLES NQ-T REVOKED.
General Grant Laid Down the Law
to President Johnson.
Daniel R. Goodloe, for many years a
flistinguished resident of Washington
nuil chairman of the commission to free
the slaves of the District once told this
story:
"One morning soon after the surren
der at Appomattox I was one of a
group of gentlemen standing on Penn
lylvanla avenue, discussing the mo
mentous questions of the day. As we
talked General Grant rode toward us,
imoking his usual cigar. Recognizing
several of us, he dismounted and joined
us.
" •What's the news? 1 he asked.
"I answered, 'We are discussing a
piece of news which comes to us di
rectly from the White House and
which gives me no little concern.'
•What is it?' asked the general
"'I understand that President An
drew Johnson Intends to revoke the
parole of General Lee and other gener
als of the late Southern Confederacy.'
" 'Who was your informant?' asked
General Grant.
"I gave him the name of tho gentle
man who had given the information.
"General Grant quietly said. Thank
you, gentlemen,' remounted his horse
and rode rapidly ■ away toward the
White House. ~ . • ■ ,
"We leisurely turned our steps In
the same direction, and as we entered
the portico we saw Grant coming down
the steps looking more excited than I
had ever seen him before. I went up
stairs and met a friend ..who had been
In conference that morning with Mr.
Johnson on the subject above men
tioned. He said to me: If you have
any request to make of the president
this morning, keep it until some othejr
time. He is angrier than I have ever
seen him. A moment ago General
Grant strode into his presence and per
emptorily demanded, "Do you intend
to revoke the parole of General Robert
E. Lee and other officers of the lato
Confederacy?"
" ' "I am considering the subject^*
Johnson replied. "You need not consid
er It Those paroles were signed by me
as general commanding the army of
the United States. My promise to them'
shall be kept In good faith If It takes}
the army of the United States, plua thd
army of the late Confederacy, td enK
force it" -■
" 'Saying this, Grant retired and left!
Johnson white with rage.'
"We never heard any more of tEU
revocation of the paroles."— lndiana^)"

Carefulness of Surgeons.
It is an object lesson in godliness tfl
see a surgeon washing his hands after
performing an operation, says the Chi
cago Chronicle. He works of course
with sleeves rolled up to the elbow, so
that the washing extends from the cra
zy bone to the tip of the finger nail
First there is a hard scrubbing wltli,
plain soap and sterilized water. This 1$
followed by. a swabbing with tlncturs.
of green soap and sterilized water.
Then comes a genuine scouring with
equal parts of quicklime and soda in
sterilized water and finally a rinsing in
a solution (1 to 2,000) of .bichloride of
mercury. Without these four separate
washings no surgeon would think of
venturing out to scatter germs of dis
ease.

" If women would pay more attention to I
their health we would have more happy I
wives, mothers and daughters, and if they
would observe results they would find
that the doctors' prescriptions do not
perform the many cures they are given
credit for.
" In consulting with my druggist he ad-
vised McElree's Wine of Cardui and Thed-
ford's Black-Draught, and so I took it and
have every reason to thank him for a new
life opened up to me with restored health,
and it only took three months to cure me."
Wine of Cardui is a regulator of the
menstrual functions and ia a most as-
tonishing tonic for women. It cures
scanty, suppressed, too frequent, irreg-
ular and painful menstruation, falling
of the womb, whites and flooding. : fi
is helpful when approaching woman-
hood, during .pregnancy, after child-
birth and in change of life. It fre-
quently brings a dear baby to homes
(that have been barren for years. All
druggists have $1.00 bottles of Wine

the sewing" Machine.
Unsuccessful Inventions That Pre-
ceded Howe's Patent Id 1946.
The technical beginning ot the sew
ing machine Industry In this country
was Sept 10, 1840, when Ellas Howe,
Jr., obtained a patent for what grew
Into the first really practical sewing
machine. Only three of the flrst Howe
machines were made, however, and
one of these was deposited In the pat
ent office in Washington as a model.
It was not until after 1850 that a fac
tory for the making of sewljjg nia
chines was built bo the enormous busi
ness of today has grown up in a short
half century.
While Howe's invention marked the
beginning of a successful Industry, he
was by no means the pioneer in ef
forts to substitute mechanical for hand
sewing. As far back as 1770 Thomas
Alsop patented in England a macWn§
for embroidering. Another njapjjfne
for embroidering in a loom was tijyj§nt
ed by John Duncan In ISO 4, an^weTj
ty-five years later another Englishman
named Hellman patented still another
embroidering machine.
■ The flrst recorded attempt at mg.
chanlcal sewing was the invention' o£
Thomas Saint who took out a, patent
in England in 1700 for a machine jwhlgij.
executed tho old crochet stitch. |£
was not a success, but some of the
features of the Saint machino appear
in the perfected machine of today._ i
Bartholemy Thimonnier patepted. iis
France in 1830 the first sewing CJ.aa
chine put to practical use. Eighty. o|
his machines were in use fof.'sewjpß
army clothing in 1841, when a mbb^do^
stroyed them because convinced, they;
would drive seamstresses out of, em/
ployment. Thimonnier built new'^AO.d;
better machines, but all his work"*:wjasi
again destroyed by angry artisans in
1848.::^;- ?i.vv : ... :
John J. Greenough took ont the first
patent for a sewing machine issued in
the United States in 1542. It was la
tended to sew leather, but was of no
practical use.
Walter Hunt of New York built a
sewing machine in 1834, but faded to
protect it by a patent After Howe's
machine appeared Hunt declared It
embodied the Ideas of his machine of
1834, but he was unable to establish
his claim.
A small army of Inventors appeared
after Howe's patent had proved suc
cessful, and then- genius was devoted
to perfecting every part of the ma
chine. How well they have succeeded
Is shown in the 8,500 patents for sew
ing machines and attachments issued
by the United States since ISSO and in
the fact that the American sewing ma
chine leads all others in every country
In the world.— New York Herald.
Care In Choosing; Glasses.
A dealer in optical instruments de
clared that it gavo him real pain to
note the careless manner in which half
the persons in New York wear glasses.
"It Is a wonder to me," he said, |that
they don't bring on blindness. In the
first place, the frames should always
be fitted to Individual faces instead of
being picked up indiscriminately with
out regard for facial peculiarities. The
size- of the lenses is another important
consideration. Most of the glasses I
see on the street are too small. They
should bo ns large as the face of the
wearer will permit, for a lens of good
size not only affords better, protection
to the eye, but is more becoming^than
a smaller one. Another tribulation "of 1
tho weak eyed is due to the reflection
from the edges of unf rained glasses?
The eyelashes should be attended .to" in
order to get the best results from a'
pair of spectacles. Many lashes .are
worn so long that they brush against
the glass. This is decidedly injurious*-!

A Lesson In Hospitality.
A curious Instance of provincial hos
pitality In a small Tuscan town is re-~
corded by Luigl Vlllarf in "Italian Ufa
In Town and Country."
A lady of very noble birth and of
considerable wealth was giving a mu
sical party— lt was the flrst time she
had invited friends to her house that
season. The entertainment began at
2 p. m. and lasted till 7. No refresh
ments were provided for the guests^
but at half past 4 a servant appeared
and solemnly presented a cup of choco
late to the hostess and one to her moth
er. This, of course, would only be pos
sible in a very provincial town. In the
more civilized spots excellent refresh
ments are always offered to the guests.
A Scriptnral Weapon.
Children tumble Into strange morass
es when they grapple with theology.
They trip over words. For example,
the other day a teacher at Stepney took
for the Bible lesson the story of Sam' (
son. At the. end of the lesson questions
were put to test the understanding of
the scholars. "With what weapon did
Samson slay a thousand Philistines?"
was the question. For a space there
was silence; Then a little girt spoke
up. "With the ax of the apostles," ehe
