JACKSON, AMADOR COUN^;QALI^ORNIA, FRIDAY, JULY 5,1901.
POLLY LARKIN
I'il tell you what it is, boys and girls,
that makes the success in life — it's
sand — and it must be the right kind of
sand, too. Sand that is made up of en
ergy and determination to succeed in
doing whatever you start out to accom
plish in the face of all obstacles. This
sand will help you to tide over many a
rough place smoothly, and again if you
have found a place in life when the
wheels of perseverance have slipped so
many times from pure disappointment
that they just simply move round and
round m an aimless sort of fashion
without 'making any headway, throw
out a little more sand, put on a little
more steam, and you will be off like a
locomotive on a well-sanded road and
heading straight for the goal of success.
Really, come to think about it, it is the
grown up folks 'who need this sand
more than the boys and girls. Youth,
although it slides from the top of a hill
to the bottom, will climb, panting and
blowing, to the top of it, just for the
fun of sliding down again. They can
more readily bear the disappointments,
for they .are only jnst beginning the
ascent of the hill of life; but those who
have reached the top and are going
down the other side slowly but surely
and reaching out to grasp the prize
of success, when the wheels move round
and round aimlessly, making no head
way, they are the ones who want more
sand on the track of life that will ena
ble them to grasp the situation. Put
on more sand, throw off the breaks of
despair and hopelessness and -you will
be very apt to s;\itiS into the station of
success. You may be sidetracked ou
the road sometimes/buf you" will event
ually accomplish your purpose.
When I am writing or doing any
hing else, that requires particular, at
tention, I disiikVt6;haye my train of
thoughts flagged, don' t you? And yet
it depends a gobd deal on the one who
flags the train of thought whether the
annoyance^lasts xi only for the moment.
I have been flagged and told to stop at
a station called ''Indefinite. Length of
Time" 'by a wee, "hazel-eyed golden
haired sprite, who wanted me to take
her on v my_ lap -and give her a long,
long ride.": I have taken her to "Ban
bury Cross to see an old. woman ride on
a brown horse," also to see "Little Boy
Blue," and. l get that far and she fin
ishes it, "come blow your/ horn, the
sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in
the corn." "More," she says, and oft
we go to see "Little Bopeep who lost
her sheep and couldn't tell where to
find them," etc., and she wants to
know who gave Bopefep all her sheep,
and answering her own question, says
she guesses "it was Dod." "More,"
she says sleepily, "ride faster." So we
climb the hill with "Jack and Jill,"
and she is elated because "Jack fell
down and broke his crown and Jill
comes tumbling after," and says "it
most killed 'em." We areon the home
stretch now. We have got as far as
'^By baby bunting, fathers' gone a
hunting to get a little rabbit skin to
wrap his baby bunting in." "Like
that," she lisps. The sand man is al
most here, the ride is not so lively as it
was in the beginning. "Rock-a-by
baby on the tree-top, when the wind
blows the cradle will rock; when the
bough bends! the cradle will fall, down
comes rock-a-by baby and all." "Good,"
she whispers. The ride is almost over.
"Mo- — ." "Sleep, babyi sleep. Thy
heavenly Father keep -" .No. need
to finish it. The sand man has come.
The dainty white' curtains with the
silken fringe has fallen over the bright
eyes, the little tender, loving arms are
untwined from my neck, and laying
her down in. her little white bed I tuck
her in snugly arid say, "God bless the
little golden head that flagged me be
fore she got to Good-night town.
Let me see: where did I get off my
train of thought? I remember, now.
It was somewhere near the place where
you must put more sand on the road
when you are at a. standstill and the
wheels merely turn round and round.
An old friend says, "It's not so much
sand you want, Polly, but pure grit.
Mix them — sand and grit, I mean— and
you'll get there every time. I've been
there," he goes on to say, "and I know
what I'm' talking about, j I've been
that low-spirited, discouraged and dis
gusted that I have actually been stand
ing' on the ragged edge of nowhere. If
you know where that is Polly, it's
more than I do. But that's where I
was — didn't know which way to move.
Guess I depended a little too much on
myself. Finally I would remember
that I had forgotten my Pilot, who
moves the universe. Then the wheels
would begin to turn, and then would
come the supply of sand and grit that
I needed, and the first thing I knew I
had pulled out oT the Gulf of Despair,
and with the star of hope for a headlight
and faith for a brake to stop before I
got to any such dangerous place again,
I was accomplishing all J had set out
to do.. I've got a little verse I can
quote that will express my sentiments
betterthan I can do, Polly, it's likethis:
"If you strike some frigid weather, anil discover
to your cost.
That you're liable to slip on a heavy coat of
frost.
Then pome prompt decided action will be called
Into demand,
And you'll slip way to the bottom if you haven't
any sand."
"There's more truth than poetry in
that, and I feel every word of it. Wish
I could impress it on every boy and
girl and every man and woman, and
the track through life could be kept
pretty clear. There s isn't much that's
flowery about me, Polly— just sand.
I'm rough, and say some things that
are pretty hard sometimes, but really
I don't mean to be unkind. It's just
my way." Good advice, and it comes
from the heart. Don't you think so? ■'.' |
Is there anything more cruel than
slander? If there is Polly would like
to know it. Slander flies like the
winged arrow tipped with its deadly
poison. It is fleet as the wind and as
treacherous and wicked as sin. It scat
ters its venom as it flies and sows it
broadcast just as the wind does the
down of the thistle. ' The slanderer is a
coward of the first water. He never
comes out openly and says what he has
to say, but throws out insinuations in
quarters to those who love the tooth
some morsel and will delight in passing
it with a little addition to the unwhole
some narrative. The slanderer is also a
falsifier. Truth has hidden her fair
face from him and he is reveling in the
joys of falsehood and deceit. With
them he is at home and in his element.
Every city, town and "village has its'
slanderer, raore's the pity, and he luiks
among the high and the low, the rich
and the poor. . ■' "■ *
BRIEF REVIEW.
Our Vast Mineral Resources.
A chart published by the Geological
Survey gives a summary of the mineral
products of the United States for the
past ten years. The aggregate values
have increased by more than one-half
in that period and the figures for 1899
are greater than in any previous year,
footing up the enormous total of $976,
000,000. The value of the metallic prod
ucts of the year is given at $527,218,084
and of the non-metallic at $447,790,862.
The latter class, includes, of course, the
coals— sl6B,ooo,ooo in bituminous and
$85,000,000 in Pennsylvania anthracite
— $64,600,00O*4n^petrpleum, §20,000,000
worth of natural gas and large value in
stone, brick clay and cement, with va
rious other minerals. Of the metals
our pig iron is worth almost as much as
all the others together, the value of the
product in 1899 being given at $245,
000,000.. Copper comes next, with $104,
000,000, and the $71,000,000 in gold
is third. The market .value of the sil
ver produced in "1899 i ;-'wss about $33,
000,000 and the lead and Jzinc together
were worth about as much... Quicksil
ver, aluminum. ' antimon^;nickel and
platinum are the othgr metals that fig
ure in the table. : . : '. il/ ■>
National Gallery lor Washington.
There is talk among, artists aud per
sons interested in art of the establish
ment in Washington ,pf an American
national gallery, which 'shall do for this
country what the National Gallery
does in London and the Louvre in
Paris. In spite of the fact that the
American capital is not the American
metropolis, Washington seems to be the
inevitable home of such a gallery when
it comes, and it is surely coming. The
present movement is credited by the
newpapers with the support of many
of .the ablest American painters and
sculptors. A committee which has it
in charge- includes in its membership
Sargent, Whistler, La Farge, Dielman,
Alexander," Macmonnies and many
others. That there is a great future for
art in America no one can doubt, but
due appreciation is still lacking in this
country for the work of our own men,'
and the highest success in art does not
yet bring in this country rewards in
reputation or in money comparable to
those attainable in Europe. : New York
still runs after foreign painters, some
what to the neglect of men as good and
in many cases better at home. ■ .
Thomas Jefferson as an Inventor.
According to William E. Curtis of
the Chicago Record-Herald • Thomas
Jefferson was an inventor of considera
ble genius. He invented a folding
chair, a revolving chair, a copyingpress
and a hemp break. His most important
invention was a plow. Mr. Bacon, his
overseer, says: "He was very ingen
ious. He invented a plow that was
considered a great improvement 6n any
that had ever been used. He got a
great many premiums and medals for
it. He planned his own carriage, build
ings, garden and fences and a good
many other things. He was nearly al
ways busy upon some plan or . model."
Jefferson's plow received a gold medal
in France in 171*0.
Britons Scooped in Making Carbons.
Carborundum and artificial graphite
are products which England ought to
manufacture,' says a London newspa
per. The works in Niagara and in
Vienna for the manufacture of these
substances have never been able to keep
pace with the demand;; though the
manufacturer fixes his own price for
the finished material. A correspondent,
traveling in Germany, calls attention to
the huge industry involved in the man
ufacture of carbons for electrical light
ing, the cathodes and anodes in electro
chemistry and other purposes. The
raw material for these are chiefly ex
ported from Grrat Britain, which reim
ports them in their manufactured form.
Sir Henry Johnston, British Com
missioner in Urganda, has discovered a
variety of giraffe having five horns. It
if named hLlladotherium, is part ox,
part giraffe, and was thought to have
been extinct for centuries.
The emerald mines of Colombia,
which are the chief mines of the kind
in the world, have been owned by the
Government for fully 200 years, and
concessions to work them have been
granted from time to time, resulting in
large profits to the contractors.
Our learning is so long in getting and
so very imperfect that the greatest

■ Vineyardists of Santa Clara county
are : experiencing the greatest loss of
vines in the history of the grape indus

it has practically destroyed all the
older vines of the west side of the val

gives it that the cause is not a disease,
but is due to three excessively dry years
in succession. This year's abundant

000,000) by July Ist, on the basis of the
cash down and the adoption by the
powers of the bonds. Japan now con
tends that she has lost 8,000,000 yen,
approximately, owing to the deprecia
tion of her 4 per cent bonds, since May
18th, and her Minister has therefore
been instructed to demand 57,942,247

mined that each nation will destroy
these forts now occupied by its troops,
but the Ministers find that the respec

destruction of Chinese forts not occu

AMADOR'S ASSESSMENT ROLL.
The assessment roll of Amador
county for the year 1901, was turned
over by Assessor Marchant to the
board of supervisors, sitting as a board
of equalization, last Monday. By the
courtesy of the county assessor, we are
enabled to give the following figures
touching the assessment values. The
total value of- all property, as shown
by the roll as It left the hands of the
assessor, is $4,555,844. To this must
be added the. -value of railroad prop
erty, the assessment of which is made
by the state board of equalization.
Last year the assessment was $84,000,
which added to the above figures,
gives a grand total of $4,639, 344. This
shows a gain over last year of $250,000
— a much more substantial increase
than was anticipated. Of course the
figures are subject to change by the
county board of equalization, which
will meet next Monday. It is hardly
probable that any material reductions
will be made.
The assessment by townships for 1900
and 1901 is herewith given for the pur
pose of comparison :
1900 1901
Township 1 1,516,546 1,610,017
Township 2. ..... .989,450 1,027,655
Township 3 425,493 402,944
Township 4 867,740 939,575
Township 0. : . . . .586,832 577,153
From this it will be Been that town
ships 3 and 5 show a small decrease,
while all other sections show sub
stantial gains. The gain in township
is not fairly represented in the above
table, as the railroad valuation is yet
to be added to the total for 1901, which
will make the increase foot up nearly
$100,000 for the valley region.
CHANGES IK THE CODE.
The recommendations made by the
Commission for the Revision and Re
form of the Law which were adopted
by the last Legislature became opera
tive July Ist.
There are over 500 of these amend
ments, but they relate principally to
Court practice. A few, however, affect
the body politic and are of Importance.
The present system of collecting
money through collection agencies will
be abolished. At present bills are as
signed to the collection agencies by
firms and individuals and suit is
brought in the name of the collector
or tho agency represented by him.
Under the new order of things col
lectors will be debarred from suing in
their name on assigned claims.
Heretofore • the practice of profes
sional men in assigning claims to col
lectors while not general, has not been
uncommon. • -.• - ■•■: ■ . .
The Code Com mission will also do
a-way with what is known as the pro
fessional juror, as the revised section
of the Coda requires that a juror to be
eligible, must not have served within
one year on a regular panel before bis
name is offered as talesman.
After July Ist instructions to juries
will be handed to them instead of being
read.
.Married women may sue or be sued
alone, without being joined by their
husbands.
A letter press copy will equal in tbe
eyes of the law the original copy.
The words "So hfilp you God," will
be eliminated from the oath as now ad
ministered in the Courts.

PINE GROVE
Pine Grove.— One day last woek
your rat-respondent look a flying trip
to the old mining camps of- Rancheria.
While there I visited the gravel . claim
of Evaus and Fitzgerald, . which is
under bond to a San Francisco Com
pany. The company are preparing to
work the mini.- on a large scale. There
are 15 men at work now, and they in
tend to put on more as soon as they get
the mine in shape. The company have
built a two-story boarding house with
all tho up-to-date improvements, and
are building a bunk house Out of. the
old stone building that was once a
hotel in the early days of Rancherie,
and I understand they will commence
work on their mill in a few days. T.hej
are to put in a roller mill to crush lie
cement gravel. iV
Ben Ross of Volcano, is reported
very sick at this wi-iting. 'Ho was
taken with a paralytic stroke!
I am informed that the men working
for tho Standard Electric Company at
Slaughter Houst? camp, struck' for
better hash laht Tuosdav- . .
Last Friday was tho liolle.it. day of
the season so far. .102 in the shade.
J: B. Dille ami Goo. Stevenbon of.
"Camp Douglas, 'J have gone to Mill
creek to work on their placer claim.
They report good prospects.
John klamann and Frank Berg of
Pioneer, have about, 30 tons of quartz
out, ready to mill. .'. It looks very
promising. i ■

"Self Shooter"' For Placer Claim.
E. Kuoheubecker is- operating the-
Strickland gravel mine, situated in
Vick's gulch on Rancberia creek,
about seven miles east of Sutter Creek.
He is operating on the old tailings and
some new ground, having an embank
ment 60 teet high, in which there are
immense boulders mixed with the
gravel. With 75 inches of free water
at his command, he has constructed a
machine for working the claim, which
is a novelty in its lino, and does effect
ive work. He calls it tbe "self shoot
er.* 1 It consists of a self-acting gate
for turning on and shutting off the
water. The reservoir is fllled every
two hours. When the water rises to a
certain point tbe gate opens automati
cally, and the deluge is directed upon
the auriferous bank. It takes only one
and a half minutes to empty the reser
voir. The effect of such a body of
water turned loose upon a bank every
two hours may be imagined. In winter
the process of filling and emptying is
repeated every half hour. * Great
boulders are tossed about like play
things, and the wash of ' debris is
enormous. The inventor claims that
the invention does not fall under the
ban of the law against hydraulic min
ing. Mr. Kuchenbeckor says he is
fully . satisfied with the yield of the
claim under this process. .Ho says it is
no trick to get $50 per day.. The ox
pense is trifling. He attends to the
operations alone.. Where, fi-ee water
is available this invention is well worth
a trial. Mr. Kuehenboekeri* about to
apply for a patent for hi.s ".self

The knife and drugs are no longer factors in the treatment of diseases; they belong to an-
other age, and to-day the up-to-date specialist, who is sclentillcally advanced In* X-Ray applica-
tions in connection with Static and Faradlc Electricity, is a master of his art.
Consumption is no longer to. be feared. The medical' faculty of'Paria, France, has fully en-
dorsed the latost cure for tuberculosis, as specilic, and we have treated hundreds of cases suc^
cessfully during the past year. The treatment consists of the Tmankfusiojj of Micbobe De-
stroying Rays by muans of static and faradic currents, passing through the patient's chest
and lungs (see endorsed editorial in San Francisco Chronicle, page 'i. Sept 3, WU).
■ So thoroughly painless and harmless is this method of cure that the subject experiences no
discomfort whatever under tbe Ray. • ■ .
CA CER— I', is now an accepted fact, universally acxnowledged among the medical pro-
fession, that Canceb is Positively Cubed and Absolutely Ehadicateu by the application

■ ..-■' -. 1
The most disastrous hut tbat lias .
isited Jackson for many years occui red t
bout midnight, on Sunday last. Ai (
hat hour tbe town was wrapped in'j
lumber, : save a few whose business ;,
Alls them to be around late at night! I j
The alarm was given' by those on tin; :
treet crying "Fire," folloivei! by font 1 :.
ir five loud reports wbich sounded like ; j
he discbarge of firearms, hut which in ; ■
act, were caused by Niglitwatchuian !,
'arker firing his pistol to give tbe ! ,
•larm, as tb« electric tire alarm refused i ,
o work. The BCtme, of tbe H-« was 111 1
Chinatown, at thf» north end of Main
treet, the most closely packed and in- ;■
lammable district of tbo town. The;
lames bad obtained a t;ood headway j
iftfore any water could bo brought to '
>ear upon them. It was at oncu rea- : ,
ized.tbat a conflagration of a most |
langerous character was in progress, ' '
hreateniag the whoV' of tb« wost sid j . '
if Main street.. ■'■ Fortunately tboie was j ;
io wind blowing. The llauies and | '
J parks shot straight upward, and to.'
his fact is due tbat tbo destruction pf ) '
iroperty was "confined to Cliiuatowti ;'
nd its immediate neighborhood." * ':\\
HOW. THE FIRE STARTED.
Notwithstanding the wildest rumors j
rare afloat for a while, there is now no { i
incertainly as to how tbe fire origi- ;
ated. It started in the Chinese store, <
be southernmost building of Chii.a
own proper, fronting on Maiu street,
'he storekeeper says hi; took a lamp ;
D his hand to look for some article, ! ;
nd the lamp exploded, scattoriug tbe j
tames all about the store, in which
here was a lot of stuff of a highly ■•om
>U6tible nature. It was at once beyond ,
he control of the Chinese residents. .
n a few minutes tbo whole of China- !
own was ablaze. Tim vacant- lot in { -
ront of the joss house, ami tietweuuji
be Chinese store, and Mrs. Parker's ji
esldence, was the meau? of staying the i i
narch of the flames southward. As it
ras, tbe firemen hu'l all Mu-y could do <
O cave the Parker dwelling. H was t
blaze on the roof and Dort.li side, for v '
uarter of au hour, and the battle with >
he devouring element- was watched
ritb feverish iut*nest, a.- it was realized <
hat upon its outcome hung tbe fate of ]
he business portion of th« town. For '
time the water was very scarce. The i •
re hoses 'throw a feebie stream. !'
rhether owing to an insufficient j
lead, or to so man,\ small hoses boing
irought into requisitioti, we are tiot
irepared to-say. The fa'-.t remains, at
he critical moment there was very
ittle water with which to dope with
he fire, and this has been t.he subject
f much comment amonsj the property
olders.
On the north the tire made a clean
weep to the bridge across tbe creek,
estroying not only the four Chinese
ilaces fronting on Main street, but also
V. S. Gilbert's 'store and dwelling
ouse; Thomas Lemiu's «a!oon. owned
y Hank Tallon, ami a small fruit
tore kept by Lasswell & Bonnefoy, and
wned by Gilbert.
On the west bank of the creek, tho
ig joss house was consumed, also tbe
Chinese sleeping bouse and a; small
uilding in the rear of this used for
ambling. Mrs. Sanguinetti also, lost
dwelling house on the west side of the
reek. ■
When the firo was at its hight, the
eat was co intense that the windows
f the business houses on . the opposite
de of the street flew into fragments.
Tot a whole window can be found,
'he buildings mostly frame, also had
close call. They caught fire repeat
dly. A squad of men were kept on
he roof with water buckets and hose,
nd succeeded in preventing the flames
etting the mastery.
The old Gould school house was
ived. It took fire in a dozen places,
ut the bucket brigade managed to
aye it, although considerably dam
jjed.
LOSS OF LIFE.
It was rumored while the fire was
mrning that one Chinaman was miss
■g, and it was feared he had perished
i the flames. This proved to be too
rue. The victim was known as
reorge. He was employed as a cook
i one of the fast bouses near the gas
r orks. He was getting along In years,
nd was addicted to drinking too free
r. He slept in the building adjoining
he joss house, on the west bank of the
reek, fully 100 feet away from the
oint where the tire started. It is be
ieved that he had retired, and was
leeping off his booze, when the flames
aught him in their fatal embrace.
Us remains were discovered in a posi
ion which indicated tbat he had fallen
ut of his bunk, when the flames bad
onsumed the supports.
LOSSES.
It is impossible to secure a correct
stlmate of the loss sustained by the
;hineee. -They lost everything. They
ad uo time to get their money and
aluables. We estimate the loss by
he destruction of the eight tenements
ccupied by tho Mongolians, including
ontents, at fully 912,000; no insurance.
.W. S. Gilbert saved about $500 worth
>f stock and ; furniture. He lost all
te possessed, stock of notions, dry
foods, etc. He figures bis damage at
1500. The fire has left him homeless
nd penniless, with a large family do
lendent upon him. His case is by far
he saddest in connection with this un
ortunate occurrence. Ho had not a
ollar of insurance.
H. S. Tallon. sufforod to tbo extent of
11600 in the loss .of tho building occu
>ied by Thos. Lemin as a saloon, lie
ras insured for $400. Thos. Lemin
lad no insurance. His loss in liquors,
urniture, etc., .is estimated at $600.
Lasswell & Boonefoy, dealers in fruit,
ucupying a small building adjoining
jetqin-'s saloon on the n.Qi-th,lp,st about
couple of hundred.
Mrs. J. Sanguinetti, in the destruc
ion of a dwelling house west of Jack-
OB creek, lost about $800. It was
iccupied by her son Lawrence and
amily, who also lost considerable in
lothing and furniture.
Mrs. Parker estimates the damage to
ler residence at $500. Insured for $500
n tbe National.
The old Gould school house, used for
. dwelling, alt.o suffered considerably.
)n the east side of Main street, the loss
>y broken windows and scorched
ornices and porches, will foot up in the
rundreds, : if not thousands." The total
ossf will not fall much short of $20,000;
t may possibly exceed these figures.
NOTES.
The fjre alarm had been out of order
pr two months. It had refused to do
!uty at the grass fire in Mason tract a
:ouplq of weeks before. It seems only
;n expert can fix it when it gets'out of
teltor, and the expert lives in Suiter
3reek, and could not attend to it
>rpmptly. Such a system cannot be
;hinged tpo qiiickjy. ■' ' . v ' '■ "'■
'.'A^^oon as tbo ashes permitted, men
tod' b6ys 'got searching among the
! titns. for valuables. It was reported
;hat a quantity of money was lost by
Jaluamen and others. The search was
cept up for some time, and was con-
Jettined by tpwhsmon geDerally, 1 Jt is
no less etoaling to take valuables from
the ruins of a firo than to take the
same from a building standing.
Finally, the sheriff appeared and
ordered them to desist.
H. S. Tallon, while the ruins were
still smoldering, started to rebuild the
saloon, so as to have some place of
business ready for the fourth celebra
tion.
The morning after the fire a singed
cat, evidently caught napping by the
blaze, was a pitiable object on the
street. The hair was all burnt off, its
eyes closed, and scars all over its body.
What became of it we know not; prob
ably some one kindly rdie.Vfil.it of its
misery by killing. -*•'.-:
Two dogs belonging to the Chinese
perished. ; They wen.' kept chained,
and the owners were too ranch con
cerned about thuir own safety to tuiok
of releasing them.
A brick fireproof baseio«i>t stood in
tho center of the burned district, and
passed through the ordeal compara
tively untouced with all its contents.
Chinamen tried to create the impres
sion that the tiro started in tho Chinese
laundry from an overheated stovepipe.
This report, however, was evidontly
started from a fear that if the truth
were told, there might be some feeling
aroused against the carrier of the latep
that exploded.
Mining Kotes
Moon— This property is situated In
the Boone ranch, on Stony creek,
about six miles from Jackson, on the
raogu of the Campo Seco copper belt.
A coinDany was organized in Valley
Spring* for the purpose of working it
at* a copper property, or at least pros
pi'cting it to determine its value in that
direction.' An incorporation was form
•••i with a capital of $75,000 in the same
number of shares at $1 each. The
principal stockholders are residents'- of
Valley Springs, with several from lone
and Jackson valleys. The mine is be
ing run on the installment plan, the
calls being three cents per share per
month. The promoters appear to be
very much pleased at the develop
ments. The uhaf t is down 90 feet, with
a seven foot iedge. Contrary to all eX
jM'otal.ions, the ore carries more vajuo
in irold than copper. Assays have been
made, and vre arc informed the returns
gave Mattering results in both gold and
copper. There is quite an excite
ment in the vicinity of the strike, apd
the further exploration of tho district
is awaited with interest. The copper
indications can be traced fora consider
able distance.
Upper Uancheria Gravel Claim— The
company operating the gravel mine in
this district, formerly known as the
10 vans and Fitzgerald claim, are fixing
up in good shape, uitli the intention of
working it on a scale that will thor
oughly test its value. They are em
ploying from 10 to 15 men. Repairing
the tunnel has been finished. Ma
chinery has beeu sent for from the east.
The KoH is contained in a cement
which has to be run through a mill,
the same as quartz. It is the intention
to erect a mill with a crushing capacity
of 250 tons per day.
Crushed By A Log
Tho particulars of the fatal accident
which occurred at Chichizola's sawmill
on the 27th of June, were brought out
at the inquest held by Coroner Gritton
un tbe 28th: It appears that Antono
B 'sMgliini, the victim, who had been
working around the mill, was sent that
morning to take the place of Frank
GiUete. the swamper, who was sick.
Bessighini was inexperienced in that
capacity. In handling a log with Peter
Karalli and W. H. Deaver, endeavor
ing to load it on the truck, the chain
gave way, probably owing to faulty
booking. The log fell or rolled on
Bessighini, crushing the life out of him
instantly. He was dead before his
companions could get to his aid to re
move the log. The coroner's jury re
turned a verdict of accidental death.
Deceased was a native of Italy, about
38 years of age, and a single man.
Early Apples.
Supervisor LeMoin left at our office
this week, a sample of early cooking
apples, grown in the orchard of Mrs.
S. J. Worley on Dry Creek, near the
Cosmopolitan mine. They were picked
from a tree only six years old. The
tree is literally covered with fruit, and
bad to be relieved of some of its load to
avoid breaking down. Many of' the
clusters have from 10 to 12 apples on
them. They are of the cooking vari
ety, and of excellent quality. It serves
to show what can be done with the soil
along the mineral belt in the way of
horticulture. The time will come
when the lands of this region will be
sought after for fruit culture, as well
as for the wealth that He* buried in
the rocks.

Seriona Brush Fires.
A fire started one day last week >n
Chris Meiss' ranch on the Plymouth
and Carbondale road. By sundown it
had burned over a part of Mtiss" land ;
about 800 acres of A. Whittle's sheep
range; between 400 and 500 acres of E.
S. Barney's; all of Loomis' 160 acres;
all of Hardenburg's 480 acres, with 120
cords of wood; Vicioi's 160 acres; all of
the Martin Brother's ranch and nearly
all of tho.Frank Green ranch. On the
following day it broke out afresh,
sweeping over the ranches of Frank
Hill, J. Touhey. Kirk, Laughton,
Joscs and others. In all about 9000
acres of pasture was destroyed. Two
houses were at first reported burned,
but this has since been denied. Some
cattle are also reported lost.
A firebug in the vicinity of the Cos
mopolitan mine started five brush fires
on the road from New Chicago to Ply
mouth last Sunday. The fires were
from 200 yards to half a mile apart.
By timely efforts of the Plymouth,
Drytown and Quartz Mountain firo
brigades no great damage was done.
Tbe firebug managed to elude those
who were anxiously looking for him.
Had he been caught, it would have
gone hard with him.
While. rushing to one of these fires,
ahorse on which Peter Fopiano was
riding fell and rolled on the rider, bad
ly injuring bis left leg. No bones were
broken, but he will be laid up for some
time. .'.'.. •

Their horses returned home a few days
ago alone. It is presumed that., the
animals were turned out ou pasture, as
one bad a bell on." No word had been
received from the campers up to Sun
day evening. But no doubt they are
all right. They intended to go about
six miles above Grizzley' Flat. . ■■'■:'■

BLUE LAKES DAM BREAKS.
Hokelumne Hiver Flooded —No Damage
Done.
The lower dam of the Blue Lakes
reservoir' system gave -way abo-it ten
o'clock Monday morning. As tbis
dam represented' a' considerable por
tion of the storage waters of .the
lakes, the breakage was sufficient to
pour an immense body of water into
the Mokelumne, causing the. river for
a distance of 40 or, 50 miles below to.
reach the highest point ever known."
The cause of the disaster was the "col
lapse of .the old wooden gate, which had
done service ever since the dam was
built, and which the company intended
to replace this .summer with an iron
structure. Indeed,' it is claimed on be
half of the Standard Electric Com pan v
that the water was intentionally turned
out preparatory to making the change,
but that the force of the water carried
away considerable of the embankment
on either side of the gate, thereby caus
ing a much quicker outflow than was
contemplated. The gate was about 40
feet from the top of the dam, and the
lake was no doubt pretty well filled
with water. The company notified the
residents of Middle Bar and other ex
posed points that a big volume of water
was coming, and for them to protect
themselves in advance. This was about
1 o'clock p. m. The wildest reports
were current, some expecting to see a
wall of the liquid element twenty feet
or more high sweep down the Mokel
umne river. But there was no wall of
water. . About 2 o'clock the river rose
very rapidly, and came within a few
inches of the abutments of the Middle
Bar bridge, the first waters being black
with logs and drift wood of every des
cription. High water was maintained
for an hour, and at 6 oclock the river
had receded but little. We have not
heard of any damage of consequence
being done by the flood in this county.
The less to the company and the
effect upon the water supply is vari
ously estimated. The officers figure the
damage at from $4000 tp $5000. The
broken dam was the main dependence
for the storage of water. Disinterested
parties think the damage cannot be re
paired for much less than $30,000.

A Cuning Contest.
A professor of languages some years
ago on returning from India remarked
upon the paucity of objectionable
phrases among the British working
classes when compared with the abun
dance supplied by the orientals of sim
ilar rank. To prove this he gives r
case which came under his own notice
He had dismissed a manservant for
dishonesty, and the next morning at 6
o'clock he sought an Interview with his
former master. He. flourished a carv
ing knife, with which he plainly in
tended to emphasize his remarks.
When he found it impossible to gain
admission, he sat under the window,
and the "s.wearing" process began. He
cursed the professor along the gene
alogical tree back to the first ancestor
of his race. Then he dwelt upon every
detail of his anatomy, from the top of
his head to the end of his toes. "For
three consecutive hours he sat there
and swore," says the professor, "with
out once repeating a phrase."
While traveling on the underground
railway in London a party of working
men entered the same compartment
and interspersed their remarks with
the commonest forms of "swearing."
The professor politely asked them to
desist, whereupon he was told to mind
his own business. Heat once com
menced to translate into English some
specimens of eastern oaths which he
had heard a Calcutta merchant's serv
ant useito a missionary's servant. The
men sidled from him as if he bad the
plague and at the next station sought

Twenty Lost Gold Mines.
There are at least 20 lost gold mines
In various parts of the world. Many
of. them have yielded rich ores and
then have been deserted and entirely
lost, i- " " : -
There' Is -one -in the north of' the
Transvaal, for instance, that was dis
covered' by accident in the eighties by
two Englishmen. The finders had en
camped one night and had, as they
thought, securely tethered their horses
when they suddenly heard a loud neigh
from one of the animals and a moment
later saw them both racing away ap
parently In the greatest terror.
Soon after dawn they were up and
after an hour's tramp found one of the
poor beasts lying on the ground with a
broken leg. In its struggles it had
kicked up the ground and had exposed
rich gold quartz only a few inches be
low the surface.
The two men marked the spot and
returned to the district a month later
to start work on the mine. But in
spite of all their efforts they could not
find the place, and to this day the mine
has not been rediscovered.
In the late seventies there was tre
mendous excitement in California
when a prospector described a gold
mine he had found. A party soon pre
pared to set out, with the discoverer of
the mine as guide, but the mine has
never been discovered, though thou
sands of dollars have been spent in
prospecting for It— Stray Stories.

TIRED OF THE TRIP.
SO HE GOT OUT OF THE BALLOON
BY THE JUMP ROUTE.
And Then When He Told the Eng
lishmen He Met What He Had Done
They Considerately Carried Him
Off to an Insane Asylum.
"I went up in a balloon once, and I
never want to mate such a trip again,"
«aid Colonel A. Noel Blakeman. "My
experience as an aeronaut was in Lon
don,", he continued, "and it would
never have occurred. but for a friend I
chanced to meet there. ■ He was going
to make an ascent, and he persuaded
me to accompany him.
"The balloon was a feature of some
big exhibition, and every day it was
Inflated and made an ascent with four
or five passengers, in charge of an ex
perienced aeronaut There were about
five in the party the day I took the trip.
We got into the basket, which was
boxed in quite high, then let the rope
go, and we shot up about 3,000 feet It
was Interesting to look down on the
world and hear tbe noises of London
streets coming from so far below. The
balloon sailed along smoothly, and we
drifted for about eight miles. ,.
"It was when we tried to descend
that the trouble began. The ', method
was to throw out anchors as the bal
loon settled toward ] the j earth. . The
aeronaut said that when one of these
anchors caught firmly he would haul
the balloon *lown to the tree In which
the anchor was expected 'to become
fastened. This would be done by wind-
Ing In the rope on a winch In the car.
We would be expected to climb out of
the balloon into the tree, he said, and
he would then take hold of the valve
rope- and. standing a safe distance
away, open the valve, let the gas es
cape, and the big affair would collapse
and sink. lie Informed us that we
must get clear of the siuking folds, as
they would come down fast, and If
they caught and covered us we would
be in an atmosphere of most poisonous
gas. . .
"All this was very Interesting, but
we did not seem to be making very
much progress toward the poiut where
we would have to look out for the de
scending folds of the collapsing bal
loon. The anchors caught in a whole
lot of trees, but they did not bold. One
would get tangled in a tree, and then
the balloon would sway far over, tilt
ing the basket In which we were until
it seemed that we would be spilled out.
Then tbe anchor would break loose,
and we would shoot up again.
"I became very tired of this and told
the aeronaut that I thought it was time
to bring the voyage to a conclusion,
he told me if 1 did not like it I could
jump out. At first I thcught be was
simply resentful of my remark, but he
said he meant what-he said.
" "When the car tilts over again, you
climb out on tbe edge,' be said, 'and let
go. It will probably be a plowed field
underneath us, and you won't get hurt'
"Well, I did as he suggested. When
the anchor caught again, I climbed out
and hung to the edge of the car. When
I saw that the car was as low as it was
likely to get. I let go. I dropped about
12 feet and. as be expected, a plowed
field was below us. --_■'.
"As soon as I dropped out the bal
loon, relieved of my weight, shot up in
the air again and soared off. I walked
to tbe nearest road and continued along
it until I came to an Inn.
"I asked the landlord how far it was
to London, and he told me it was eight
miles. I ordered a carriage to take me
there, and while I was waiting the
landlord asked me where I bad come
from.
"I took him to the door of the Inn,
and, pointing to the balloon, which was
then sailing along about a quarter of a
mile above the ground, I said, '1 jump
ed out of that.'
"The man looked at me In alarmed
fashion, and after I had returned to the
sitting room I noticed that several peo
ple peered through tbe window at me.
"Finally my four wheeler was ready,
and I set off for London. After we bad
driven along for half an hour or so the
coachman suddenly turned the horse In
through a gate, and we drove into a big
courtyard. I yelled to him and asked
him what be meant, that I wanted to
go straight to London, but be paid no
attention and slowly circled the court
When be stopped on tbe other side, a
man wearing glasses stuck his bead In
the carriage, scrutinizing me closely,
pulled- back, said something to the
coachman, and we drove on to London.
"Finally we reached my lodgings,
and when we did so the coachman
Jumped off the box. ran up the steps
and as soon as his knock was answered
asked if Mr. Blakeman lived there.
The maid was just answering that I
did when I reached the top of the steps
and collared the fellow.
" 'What was that place you drove me
into on our way to London?* I asked
bim. .:
" 'It was a blnrqne basylum, sir,' he
replied. "When you said you had jump
•d out o' that balloon, we thought you
was crazy and maybe you was a es
caped patient from tbe basylum.'"—

Tlie Common Froer.
If a traveler were to announce that
he had discovered in some remote part
of the globe an animal whose tongue
was rooted in the front of Its mouth,
the tip pointing down the throat, and,
further, that the creature's manner of
breathing was so peculiar that the sur
est way of suffocating it was to keep
its mouth fixed open, there would be
some little curiosity about the "find."
If the discoverer went on to say that
the creature began existence as a fish,
breathing by means of gills and hav
ing a heart of only two chambers, but
had undergone transformation, discard
ing gills and gradually acquiring lungs,
adding a third chamber to Its heart,
and so in^tbe truest and most literal
sense passing from the order of fishes
to the order of reptiles, the public
might even become excited about this
extraordinary animal— until It came out
that it was uo other than the common
or garden frog. Then probably 10 per
sons out of 20 would instantly cease to
take any interest in the subject if they
did not feel some resentment against
the man who had contrived to draw
their attention for a time to such a
common reptile.

"Well," said he, "I think 1 could

"Well," replied Mr. Carnegie, "1
could hardly afford to do it for less
than $5,000,000." He smiled a little at
sight of tbe editor's face and then went
on: "No; I must withdraw that. What
I should put into it has cost me much
more than that, and of course you
would not expect me to sell it to you at
less than cost." ■ *

PECULIAR NAMES.
The Queer Way Ten Million Children
Were Designated.
"In a loug experience in the treasury
department I have come across a very
large number of names, many of which
are rather peculiar." explained. an old
official, "but I think the list of names
In connection with the subscription to
the 3 per cent bonds surpasses any
thing In the way of peculiarity that I
have ever observed: Of these the one
that struck me most was a man who
signed himself Ten Million and who re
sides out In Oregon. We thought the
name was an Imaginative one and
wrote the man that it was desired that
the bonds sbould be registered In real
names only and that no further atten
tion would be paid to his subscription
until ho was heard from. He replied'
that his name was Ten Million, i His
letter was written on the printed letter
head of the firm of Million & Million,
two brothers. . -V-v-
"Then followed' au explanation that
bis father and mother were unable to
select names for their children that
were mutually satisfactory and that as
a result though they had had ten chil
dren, none of them was ever christened
formally. The flrst~ child was a girl,
and she was known only as One Mil
lion. The second child, also a girl, was
known as Two Million. . .Thus they ran
along until Ten Million was reached,
and be was the writer of the letter, the
other member of the firm being a
brother whose only name, as far hs-the
family was concerned, was Seven Mil
lion, the seventh child. He added that
One Million had afterward called her
self Una Million, that the third girl was
known after she had grown up as Trio
Million. The others bad taken on addi
tions to their uames. and he bad adopt
ed the name of Tenis Million, but bis
real name was Ten Million and nothing
else. The bonds were issued .to him
and on the books of the department
were registered In the. name of Ten

there is a lot containing only two
graves, and the headstone of each is
marked 'Father.'
"The woman who is buried here was
married twice, and the two graves in
that lot are the graves of her two hus
bands. She tried her best to treat her
second husband as she did the first,
and even .when he died she had no idea
of showing any preference. But she
was sick when the funeral service of
her second husband was held. She di
rected that the partner of her second
matrimonial venture be laid by the
side of the first, but that enough space
be left to bury her between the two.
"By some hook or crook- a mistake
was made, and when she visited the
cemetery she found that they were
buried side by side, with no space l.c

The const of Japan, notwithstanding

be used in feeling its way. No invad

HINTS FOR FARMERS
The Grass Crop.
The cool weather cf. April and May
has caused tho .grass to grow slowly,
aud Ifluis made -a thick growth at the
bottom rathei; than a rank growth. As
a result ninny are prophesying a heavy
hay' crop, good pasturage and a plenti
ful supply of milk and milk products.
We hope they will not be disappointed,
but it is well to remember that many
grass fields were severely, injured by
the drought of last year, and even copi
ous spftes rains cannot restore life to
dead roots. Such fields will produce
but light < : - ops. and those will not be of
the better quality of hay. The coarse
and comparatively innutritions grasses
will live, while many of the better va
rieties will have disappeared or "will
make but a scanty and feeble growth.
Again, so much surplus moisture in the'
first four months of the year is very
likely to be followed by a dry season
later on. The total rainfall In- a" year
varies but little from one -year-to' an
other, and a wet spring usually- rs a
forerunner cf a dry summer and fall.
If this proves true this year, wip cannot
hope for a heavy second crop upon' the
mowing lands and may find ; pasture9'
furnishing but Tittle late .feed. The
farmer who Is not in haste to clean out
all the old hay in his barns or the ones
who' provide forage crops to help the
cattle when they do not getenough In
the pasture will be the lucky ones/
Early Garden Vegetables.
Thece was a time when the'gardener
who"had his produce ready for the mar
ket earlier than his less enterprising
neighbor was well repaid for his care
and trouble by better prices for the.
products. Then the early bird caught
the wealthy consumer. Now the early
worm in the northern states finds his
profits If not himself picked up by
those In a southern climate, who can
plant, grow aud put on the market a
crop before the plow can penetrate the
frozen soil of the northern states. "We
are inclined to think the chance for
profit today for market gardeners in
I lie north, fays American Cultivator, Is
in growing such crops as will not ma
ture until southern produce no longer
fills our markets and perhaps Jn put
ting that in cold storage that It' may
not lie brought out until there are indi
cations that it is much wanted by those
who are willing to p:iy liberal prices
for it. Let early crops puss by and
strive to grow cro;is of such quality as
will suit even those who hnve been
using the earlier products of the south

Striped Cncumber Beetle.
We have seen cucumbers and squash
es protected from the striped bugs by
putting over cacli hill a box covered
with mosquito netting and have also
seen a square of netting fastened to
four small sticks which met in the cen
ter running to the corners and project
ing far enough to be stuck in the
ground, forming a sort of pyramidal
tent. And we have seen many of them
and of the black or stinking squash
bug killed by putting a shingle or bit
of board at tbe side of the hill and be
fore sunrise in the morning visiting
them and killing those that had found
shelter under it. Those who are trou
bled with these pests may take their
choice of the above methods. Many
cannot or do not like to visit the field
or garden at or before sunrise every
morning, yet the 'lnsects will not re
main under the shingles much later, or
If found there will not wait to be killed,
as they will fly as soon as warmed up.
Loss off Ammonia.
: In all decomposition there Is a re
sulting production of ammonia, which
becomes a total loss or evaporates in
the atmosphere if not absorbed by
some substance which has the power of
absorption. Land plaster has that pow
er, mid it is i-aid that kainit has even
more of it. Dry earth is also' a good
absorbent, and the drier it is the better
It Is as an absorbent, as water alone,
while holding a certain amount of am
monia in solution, does not readily ab
sorb it, but rather parts with it to the
surrounding, atmosphere. Lime and
ashes liberate ammonia, the ashes or
any material containing potash more
than the carbonate of lime. They there
fore should never Ge mixed with nitrog
enous manure until tbe latter is mixed
with earth or some other absorbent of
nitrogen.' •
Spraying to Kill Charlock.
Dp to this time all the experiments

periment by M. C. Dasserre which has
proved even more so. He used a2O per
cent solution of nitrate of soda, or 200

acre. Not only was the charlock de
s'royed at once and very thoroughly,
but the wheat received the full value of
the fertilizer in the nitrate and was de

AFTER THE BATTLE.
A VETERAN'S STORY OF A TASSELED
TURKISH FEZ.
The Gnmoiue Incident In Which He
Participated at the Second Battle
of Manannnx— A Brave Boy and His
Dying Request.
"Whenever 1 see a tasseled Turkish
fez," said a Confederate veteran whose
attention had been attracted by a
smoking cap of that pattern In a Canal
street window, "I am reminded of a
curious and rather grewsome incident
of my campaigning days. It was on
the morning after the second battle of
Manassas," be continued In response to
a request for the story, "and several of
us from my company had gone over to
tbe field in the hope of picking up a
few things thav we badly needed and
for which the dead had no further use
—waterproofs, for instance, and sound
canteens. • . : ■ : ' •
"During the previous day's engage
ment you may remember that a regi
ment of freshly ' recruited New York
zouaves held the crest of a hill and
were charged and almost annihilated
by Hood's brigade. They were mowed
do.wn like ripened grain and fell so
thickly that their .corpses literally car
peted the earth. I dare say it was us
awful a. slaughter, considering the
number engaged, as occurred anywhere
In the course of the war. >_,:J
"Well, we hadn't gone very far when
we came to tbis,,hlll and began to get
anuing the dead men. The poor fellows
had been : mustered into service less
than aweek before, and they'were said
to be the most gorgeously uniformed
military troop ever organized. They
wore ' scarlet Turkish trousers, blue
jackets embroidered with gold bullion
braid and purple fezes with long pend
ent tassels.
"Being just from the outfitters, nil
this fine regalia- was perfectly fresh
and new, and somehow, or other it
added to the gbastliness of the specta
cle on the hillside: The. corpses were
in all sorts of strange postures, and
their fantastic costumes gave them an
air of horrible grotesqueuess that I
couldn't begin to describe in words.
. . "However,' to come to my point 1
had picked up a fez to carry away as a
relic and was about to leave tbe spot
when I happened to notice a much
handsomer specimen on tbe bead of a
little zouave, stretched out, stiff, and
stark, a few yards away, with a band
kerchief over bis face. 1 stepped up to
make a 'swap.' but had barely touched
the tassel when a low, sweet toned
voice under tbe handkerchief said,
'Please don't!'.-
"For a moment." continued the veter
an, "that unpleasant protest, coming
from what I bad supposed to be a
corpse, made my hair bristle on my
head. . Then 1 lifted the handkerchief
and was shocked to see tbe delicate,
refined feat urn of a boy not over 15.
He was pale ifs death and evidently
desperately wounded, but he looked at
me calmly. '.My God," 1 exclaimed,
•wLat a lad yon are to be here!' .'l'm
afraid I'm dying unless I have help.'
he replied. 'Do you think the surgeons
will lie around pretty soon?' The Lord
knows!' 1 groaned, for. tbe boy's cour
oge touched me to the heart. ' 'Your
surgeons have all run away, and we
only, have a few, with more wounded
than they can attend to." 'Then I guess
all I can do is to lie here quietly and
die,' he said -.ln the same gentle voice.
"Can you get me a little water before
you go?' . . . •
"1 took his canteen and hurried down
to a branch at the foot of the hill,
where the first thing I saw," by the
way. was the corpse of a zouave float
ing in a pool. 1 went up the stream far
enough to get out of the horrible death
zone, filled the canteen with pure wa
ter and was soon back at tbe boy's side.
I gave him a drink, and be thanked me.
"Is there nothing else I can do?" 1 asked
awkwardly, because I knew our com
pany was under early marching orders
that morning and that It would be im
possible for me to linger much longer.
'Nothing at all, thank you.' he replied.
"No message to anybody? 1 .'No; noth
ing, thanks.'
"I turned away most reluctantly and
had gone only a few .yards when, 1
heard hi 3 thin voice calling me hack.
'Excuse dip,' he said, "but 1 want you
to accept this as a present,' and be
handed me his fine purple fez. 'Xo. no,'
I exclaimed, 'greatly embarrassed: '1
couldn't think or taking It. When I
started to a little while ago. 1 thought
you— you'— Thought 1 was dead, of
course,' he Interrupted. "Well, 1 soon
will, be, and that other fez will do me
just as well. Please put it on my head
and take mine.' I saw that he would
be hurt unless I did as he desired, so 1
took tbe fez and went away. ■•'

pany was on the march, and. needless,
to say, I never heard anything more of
the little child zouave. He was badly
wounded and undoubtedly died where

Costly Wtnea.
Our millionaires think $75 a gallon
for rare old Madeira an utterly impos
sible price simply because their tastes
are blunted by champagne, and they
care no more for a bottle of Welsh Re
serve, Newton-Gordon or Chillings
worth-Oglethorpe than for a cheap
sherry. In the famous cellars of the
Hotel de Ville at Bremen there are a
dozen cases of holy wine which have
been preserved for 230 years. A mer
chant figures out that if the cost of
maintaining the cellars, payment of
rent, interest npon the original value of
the wine and other Incidental charges
are considered a bottle of this choice

is worthless on account of "starvation." \

me that it is very human and require* )
