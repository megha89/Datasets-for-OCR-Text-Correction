Uncle Rastus, who was seeking In
formation concerning mushrooms, had
been referred by a preternaturally sol
emn student to the professor of botany,
and, with hat In hand, be was address
ing that dignitary.
"Would yo' mind tellin' me, MisUh
Mandrake," he said, "how to 'stingulsh
a musharoon f m a toadstool?"
"Willingly," replied the professor.
"In the first place, you must remember
that the Amanita phalloldes, or deadly
agaric, closely resembles the Agaricus
campestris, or edible fungus, which is
our common variety and absolutely In
nocuous. Next It will be necessary -.to
fix firmly in your mind the distinguish
ing marks or characteristics of the
Agaricus campestris, which are these:
A pilous riot covered with excrescence
like scales; gills of a brownish purple
when mature; stalk solid and approxi
inataly cylindrical; ring near the mid
dle of stalk; base not bulbous and not
sheathed by membrane. The distin
guishing characteristics of the! Amanita
phalloldes, or deadly agaric, are these:
Plleus destitute of dtstlnot excres
cences; white gills, hollow stalk; large
ring and prominent bulb at base, with
membranous upper margin. Bearing
these points of differentiation fully In
mind you will never be at a loss to
determine which variety you encounter
in any given case."
"Yes, euh," said Uncle Rastus, turn
ing his hat round and round in his
fingers. "I un'stan" dat all right, but

Her Prayer.
The Buffalo News tells a story of a
four-year-old girl who was spending a
night away from home. At bedtime
she knelt at her hostess.k nees to say
her prayers, expecting the usual prompt
ing. Finding Mrs..B. unable to help
her out she concluded thus: "Please,
God, 'scuse me; I can't remember my
prayers, and I'm staying with a lady
that don't know any." :

Barnum's
Monkeys
"AH well — all happy — lots
of fun". That is the regular
report from the monkey cage
of Barnum's Circus ever since
the keepers began dosing the
monkeys with Scott's Emul-
sion. Consumption was carry-
ing off two thirds of them
every year and the circus had
to buy new ones.
One day a keeper accident-
ally broke a bottle of ScottV
Emulsion near the monkey
cage and the monkeys eagerly
lapped it up from the floor.
This suggested the idea that it
might do them good. Since
then the monkeys have received
regular doses and the keepers
report very few deaths from
consumption. Of course it's
cheaper to buy Scott's Emul-
sion than new monkeys — and
that suits the circus men.
Consumption in monkeys
and in man is the same disease.

HIS NOSE WAS SAFE.
But His Nerves Were In a State of
Cold Chill Collapse.
"I was sitting on the veranda of a
far western hotel one afternoon," said
the Boston drummer, "and was lazily
smoking one of the nicest meerschaum
pipes you ever saw when out of the
tall of my eye I saw that a native down
at the other end of the. veranda had his
gun sighted at me. They were a wild
lot around there, and I couldn't tell
whether he meant to shoot me or. the
pipe. The chances were In favor of the
pipe, however, and It seemed a good
chance to test my nerve. I made up
my mind to let him shoot and to pre
tend a careless air, but I'm telling you
in the ten or fifteen seconds of waiting
the sweat came out at every pore and
my heart pounded my ribs sore. I felt
a sort of tick at the bowl of the pipe,
heard the "crack of the gun and knew
that the bullet had passed through the
pipe. I got a brace with my hands and
feet and waited for a second bullet,
and it went through the bowl after the
first I sat there until his fourth bul
let had hit the pipe and knocked the
bowl off the stem, and then the shooter
sauntered up to me and laughingly
said:
" 'Excuse me, stranger, but I thought
It was Imitation.' . .
" 'Same as yon are,' I replied.
"My gibe hnrt him, but he was man
enough to tell everybody about 'my
nerve, and the boys chipped In suffi
cient nuggets to buy me this fifty dol
lar smoker. Say, do you know what
happened to me when I made an ex
cuse to go up stairs after my old corn
cob? I had no sooner got into my room
than my knees gave out chills galloped
up my spine, and I'll be hanged If I
didn't faint away and He there for ten
minutes. It had suddenly occurred to
me that the bowl of that pipe was only
six Inches from my nose while the fel
low was doing his shooting, and I have
not yet got over touching my nasal
organ now and then to see If It Is
safe."
NDIAN PRAIRIE DOG HUNTS
The Little Animals Are Deemed a
Dainty Dish by the Narnjoen.
The Navajo Indian, while he cannot
be prevailed upon to eat a rabbit, 1b
greedily fond of fat prairie dogs. Large
communities of these small animals
abound ou the western plains, and the
Navajo has resorted to many ingenious
methods for trapping his coveted dain
ty. One of them is by the aid of a bit
of mirror placed at the entrance to a
burrow. When the animal ventures
from his bedroom, deep under ground,
he sees a familiar Image mocking him
at the front door, and he hurries out to
confront the Impudent intruder, when
Jie is pinned to the ground with an ar
row.
But the most effective method is
what the Indians call the rain hunt As
soon as the steady downpour of sum
mer rains begin every Navajo who can
walk repairs to the prairie dog village
with hoes, sharp sticks or any digging
Implement. With these they hollow
out trenches that will lead the storm
water into as many burrows as possi
ble. Soon a little stream is pouring
down each small home, and the inmate,
much disturbed, pops out to see what
the matter can be. Many of the ani
mals remain under ground until they
are drowned, and their bodies float to
the surface.
After such a bunt. In which many
pounds of prairie dogs are generally
secured, there Is a feast for many days
in the Navajo huts.— New York Com
mercial Advertiser.
The Time For Planting Bulbs.
There Is no definite rule to be laid
down as to the length of time in which
bulbs should be left In cold storage.
As a general thing, top growth will not
begin until root growth is completed.
This nearly always takes from six
weeks to two months. It Is therefore
generally safe to begin bringing Octo
ber planted bulbs to the living room In
December. Those desired for later
flowering can be left in cold storage,
where they will remain dormant as to
top growth. By bringing bulbs to light
and warmth at Intervals of a week or
ten days we secure a succession of
bloom which makes It possible for us to
brighten our windows with their beau
tiful flowers during the greater part of
winter.— New Lippincott

ON THE VERGE OF SUCCESS
The Easy Steward and the Anda
clons "Grafter."
A man walked Into one of the up
town college clubs one morning aud sat
down in the smoking room. . His air of
assurance was hardly in accord with
his tattered clothes. It was early, and
none of the members was al.out Ho
rang the bell, and the steward re
sponded.
"It seems good to get back into the
club again," he remarked."
"Yes, sir," said the steward.
"I used' to be a member hero, but I've
had hard luck and can't afford It any
longer."
"Yes, sir; I'm sorry, sir." said tho
steward.
"By the way, I'm a little short of car
fare this morning," said tho nervy
stranger. "Could you let me have ten
cents until I call here again?" .
The surprised steward reached Into
his pocket and handed out a dime.
"Thank you," said the man. . . "Now,
I'm also a little hungry, having bad no
breakfast Do you suppose you could
gather me up a little luncheon?"
The steward was stupefied by such a
display of nerve.
"And a little whisky with a dash of
bitters would not go badly with the
food."
The steward fled as one ot the mem
bers entered. The stranger saw the
new arrival and rose hastily.
"I am too parly for my friend." he
said as he walked toward the door.
"I will return later." Then he added
In an undertone, which the doorboy
heard: "Too bad, too bad! . That stew
ard was ensy. He'd given me the club
If I'd asked for It. It's a wonder those
members wouldn't stay away." The
man of nerve walked down the street
with his head bowed In deep thought.

paying for It" was his theme.— New

The Terrapin Disease.
The terrapin Is thought to have much
influence in causing sickness, and the
terrapin disease is either a rheumatic
aflliction about the chest and ribs or
possibly some pulmonary trouble. The
association of the terrapin with diseases
in this portion of the body doubtless
originates from the fact that the ribs
of the terrapin are not free, as In the
case of most of the higher animals, but
are united Into one piece.
i An Indian who was 111 applied for re
lief to a shaman and was asked, "Did
you not when a boy tie strings to the
terrapin's tail and worry the creature V"
The patient admitted that he did.
"Well," said the medicine man, "that
Is what is the matter. It Is the terra
pin's turn now, and the terrapin is pay
ing off old scores. You have the terra
pin sickness, and all your ribs have
grown together and to your breast
bone."
The shaman administered the proper
remedy prescribed In such cases— l for
get what it was— and the man thought
he was cured.

"Yes, sah, too airly. An' was yo'a

A FISHING FICTION.
THE "MAGIC EYE" OF THE SAULT
STE. MARIE INDIANS.
An Old Guide's Explanation of the
Inillan Whlteflsh Hunter's Method
of Getting Ills Glistening Catch
Prom Under the Rapids.
"The first time I fished in the Sault
Pie. Marie rapids," said a well known
Lake Keuka sportsman. "I landed in
an hour twenty-one brook trout that
weighed forty-flve pounds; so I was
ready and willing to believe anything
I heard or read about the possibilities
of those waters or the astounding
things that men who fished In them
weii' able to do.
"Consequently I believed what they
told me about the marvelous feats the
Indian fishermen of the Sault Ste.
Marie could perform In the way of
setting wbltefish. Few who have tour
ed the great lakes have not heard of
those same feats, witnessed them and,
of course, could do nothing but go
away believing that they were «11 they
seemed to be.
' "Particularly will they marvel, as I
did, at the Indian whlteflsh fisherman's
magic eye with which he seems to
look down through ten feet or more of
foaming, rushing water and see white
fish that to the white man's eye would
be Invisible five inches beneath the
surface. It would have been strange
if I had not marveled at It, having
witnessed more than once manifesta
tions of its alleged power. That was
before I talked with old Guide Gnrron.
'The astounding feats of the Indian
whiteflsh netters of the Sault Etc.
Marie that the guidebooks and the
hotel keepers and steamboatmen Insist
on telling tourists about are performed
by two Indians In a canoe. One occu
pies the stern and manipulates the
paddle to keep the canoe's bead point
ed up stream. The Indian In the bow,
standing upright, uses'a pole to aid in
propelling the canoe or in keeping it
steady..
"Lying ready to his hand is a dip net
four feet In diameter, fastened to the
end of a pole perhaps fifteen feet long.
The fishing Iv done at the foot of tho
rapids, where the water bolls and tum
bles furiously. With his pole the In
dian In the bow keeps the boat moving
about In the rapids and gazes constant
ly Into the water, which Is often teu
feet or more deep. i\ ■, ;
-^"Suddenly the Indian In the bow will
seize the net handle 'with one hand,
never ceasing to manipulate the canoe
with his pole in the other nor for an
instant removing his staring gaze from
the water. The net is not more than
in his hand before he has plunged it
perhaps teu feet distant from the boat,
thrusting It at the same instant to the
bottom. Then be gives it a peculiar
twist, draws it up and, surrendering
the care of the canoe for the moment
to the Indian with the paddle, he
draws the net up, never without from
three to half a dozen glistening white
fish In It. frequently weighing five
pounds each.
"The wondering spectator, seeing
nothing but the boiling water, the sud
den start of the Indian and his quick
and dexterous plunging and drawing
up of the net with its invariable load
of whitefish, can do nothing but ac
knowledge to himself the necromancy,
of the Indian's piscatorial art I know
that I did, and for two seasons gave
myself away to the fascination of that
mysterious fishing. Then one day I
marveled at It greatly to Guide Garron.
the shrewd and cunning old French
man who knows every rock and eddy
and whirlpool of the rapids and all the
wiles and tricks-'that any other guide
knows and a whole lot that no other
one does know, and Garron's little
black eyes twinkled.
" 'Ah!' he chuckled. 'Zat mageeck
bye. He yon gr-r-rand homboagl* >
"Then he explained in his voluble
find picturesque patois the apparent
mystery of the Indian whiteflsh fisher
man's magic eye. Whitefish are natu
ral denizens of the still, silent wate-i
of the great lakes. To get from Lake
Huron, to Lake Superior these .'fish
must fight their way up the fierce and
stubborn Sault Ste. Marie rapids. . In
doing this they travel by easy stages.
They can brave the rapids but a short
distance at a time, when, almost ex
hausted, they drop Into the shelter, of
the friendly rocks that pile the bottom
of the rapids.
"Huddled sometimes by the score be
hind these rocks, getting wind, as '*
were, to overcome another stage jof
their Journey, the whlteflsh, if the wa
ter is not too deep, can be lifted out
by the hand of the fisherman, they are
so nearly exhausted. The Indians, as
well as the white fishermen know, this
and, knowing well the location of these,
sheltering rocks, have only to thrust
their nets dowu behind them and draw
them up filled with fish.
"The cunning of the Indian led blm
long ago to give visitors the impression
that he could penetrate the troubled
depths of the rapids with his gaze and
discover the whitefish ou the bottom.
The wonder of It spread, aud It has
been one of the fondest and best pay
ing fictions of 'Susan Mary,' as the na
tives give you the pronunciation of the
Sault Ste. Marie."— New York Times.

THE WAY OF A TORNADO.
One That Was Remarkable Both In
Appearance and Action.
"A tornado that was remarkable both
In appearanoe and In action was one
that traveled from Texas across Okla
homa and Indian Territory In May,
18IXV says Bart W. Mayo In Alnslee's.
"A man in Sherman, Okla., wbo had ex
ceptional opportunities for observing
the storm, inasmuch as he was caught
up In It and carried several hundred
yards before descending to earth again,
is certain that It was not funnel
shaped. He says of It:
" It looked to me like a great ball of
vapor rolling over and over toward
me. When I first saw it distinctly, It
was at a hill perhaps an eighth of a
mile away. It seemed to be about 250
yards wide and 100 feet high. The mo
tion was that of a ball rolling over and
over, not spiral, and it came on rather
Blowly, perhaps thirty miles an hour.
Whatever the ball of cloud struck was
lifted right off the ground.
" 'I saw It pick up house after house
between the hill and me, and the cloud
seemed to be full of flying boards and
timbers. When the ball reached Mrs.
C.'s, the house nearest me, It went
straight up oS its foundations. The
house remained intact until It was
about twenty or twenty-flvo feet from
the ground, then it burst open and the
fragments flew in all directions. It
looked like an exploding bomb. The
corn and cotton standing a hundred
feet on either side of the storm's path
were uninjured, but whenever the
cloud struck the higher ground It
spread out, covering a wider strip of
the surface.
" 'When the cloud struck me, I went
up lightly and easily and the sensation
was. not unpleasant, bnt I came down
hard and was badly shaken up, al
though not seriously Injured. On the
highway north of Sherman fence wires
were torn from the posts and pounded
into the hard surface of the road a dis
tance of two or three Inches.' "
THE WOMAN WHO FAINTED.
A Lesson on Courtesy In a Crowded
London Theater.
Here is an example of the courtesy
and good feeling of the twentieth cen
tury.. How are we to account for it?
The worst of it is that In such a case
the Innocent suffer for the guilty. When
a woman does really faint there will
be some hesitation before she receives
a seat consolation and brandy. '
In an overcrowded pit of one of the
London theaters the other night a lady,
who was standing, suddenly became
very faint, and another lady sitting
near kindly offered her her seat Not
only this, but, seeing that she did not
recover quickly, she went and fetched
some restoratives from the refreshment
room, whereupon the lady quickly re
covered and began to thoroughly enter
Into the spirit of the play, apparently
quite oblivious of her benefactress.
As time went on she was asked by
her benefactress If she would object to
her sitting down again. But the other,
would none of It. "Now I have a seat
I mean to keep itl" she replied. Where
upon her benefactress gently reminded

The Necessity of Bait.
Although in treaties on dietetics salt
figures as a condiment, it is universally
recognized to be something more; in
deed It Is an indispensable element of
the food of man and animals. A well
known authority asserts, says The
Medical Press and Circular, that when
ever the annual consumption of salt
falls below twenty pounds per head of
population the public health is likely
to suffer. The deprivation of salt does
not produce a definite disease, but re
duces the vitality of the organism as a
whole, so that the victims of adminis
trative measures which restrict the
consumption of salt -more readily fall
prey to prevailing epidemics, as well
as to endemic maladies.

tle Influence.
The atmosphere plays its part In geo
logical operations. Its corroding pow
er, backed by rain and wind, helps to
decay and disintegrate those rocks
which ore exposed to its influence. Rain
completes the work thus begun. Wind
blows dust, sand and volcanic ashes
over large tracts of earth— in fact,
over the whole of it
It is only of late years that geolo
gists have discovered that fine vol
canic dust is carried over the whole of
the earth's surface and plays a very
Important part in the deep sea depos
its. On deserts and nearly rainless re
gions blown sand will wear away the
hardest rocks by beating against
them. Some sandstone formations ap
pear to have been piled up by winds.
Winds cause ocean currents, waves
and storms. The great denuding
power of the sea is largely due to the
atmosphere. Some parts of . the Eng
lish coasts are being rapidly washed
away. Plants and animals have their
distribution considerably affected by
winds and ocean currents. Again,
whether living in water or on land,
animals live on the oxygen supplied
from the atmosphere, and land plants
absorb carbonic acid from the same
source. • ■■ . . . .«
Rain acts in two ways: (1) chemic
ally by dissolving certain substances,
such as lime, out of the rocks, and (2)
mechanically by wearing down their
surfaces as it flows over them. Any
old building— a ruined castle or cathe
dral, for instance— shows a "weath
ered" surface resulting from the ac
tion of rain and wind. .In sandstone
structures the details of carving are
often lost, and on old tombstones the
lettering can hardly be deciphered.
Springs are due to rainwater collecting
in rocks and rising to the surface.
Rivers are fed by rains and springs.
A river is a very powerful geological
agent. In the hardest rocks rivers
gradually carve out a valley or. gorge.
This is accomplished partly by chemic
ally dissolving certain mineral sub
stances, but chiefly by mechanical
erosion; the stones, sand and mud
wearing away the bed .of a stream as
they run and tumble over it
The finest examples of river action
are the famous canyons of Colorado,
which in some places are gorges 5,000
or even 6,000 feet deep, with vertical.
sides. But as already pointed out
rivers have a constructive action quite
as important as their destructive ac
tion. Bj bringing down their burden
of sediment Into lakes, estuaries and
seas they build up great piles bit rock
and "sow the dust of continents to
be." *
Glaciers are rivers of Ice fed by the
"eternal snows" of high mountain
ranges such as the Alps. They wear
out their own valleys as rivers do;
they transport mud, sand and stones to
great distances, In some cases sending
them scaled up in Icebergs to float far
out to sea and on melting deposit their
burdens on the sea floor. Off the coast
of Newfoundland northern icebergs
are depositing a great mass of "gla
cial drift"
The sea Is a great denuding agent;
but its work is more constructive than
destructive. It Is the workshop where
nearly all the stratified rocks have
been accumulated and ranged In layers
or strata. The rivers and ocean cur
rents continually bring in fresh sup
plies of debris even for hundreds. of
miles. . ■ .
Man, compared with the lower ani
mals, produces but little effect as a ge
ological agent Still the human race
has considerably modified the distribu
tion of plants by cutting down forests
and by cultivating certain*- plants to
supply food. So with animals. Cer
tain useful ■pecles have been cultivat
ed and enormously Increased. at the
expense of others which prove useless
or harmful. ■ .' . : 
But plants and animals have, had,
and still have, far more Influence .geo
logically. Coal seams are made up of
vegetable remain's of former ' periods.
Forests have an Important influence
on climate and on animal as well aa
plant life. , In the comparatively un
known world of the ocean marine
plants doubtless have important func
tions. . -:..-.
Marine animals accomplish a vast
amount of, geological constructive
work. Great deposits ' thousands of

Coral reefs afford the most .familiar

The force known as heat Is of great
Importance. The earth is hotter below
the surface and probably has a "very
high temperature toward Its center.
Iv oouiu places nut very far below its
surface It contains highly heated rock,
which occasionally flows over the sur
face during volcanic eruptions. In
other places we find hot springs in con
nection with volcanic action.
Heat exercises a powerful Influence
on rocks deeply burled below the
earth's surface, chiefly by means of.
heated .water and steam. In this. way
rocks have been very much altered
or "metamorphosed." The crystalline
schists have thus been brought to their
present state by a series of chemical
changes due to heat and there is no
doubt that they were ' once ordinary

Habits of Seals.
The habits of seals are very Interest-

in the water until he Is taught by his
mother to swim. , She takes him Into
the "water dally, on her fin and dumps
him In, and when he , gets tired of
floundering about places him on her
fin again and returns to her camp.
When the young seals are well grown,
they suddenly disappear with their
mothers and the bull seals. No one
knows where they go, and their return
is equally as sudden as their departure.
The bulls are the first to put in an ap
pearance at the camping ground.
When they arrive, they commence at
once to prepare a camp for their mates,
which they stake off, and for which
they fight until they die. In the mean
time the female seals remain -quite a
distance from land, floating lazily on
the water and seemingly having a good
time.

A CORRECTION.
Our attention has been called to an
error in our article last week touch
ing the fees for legal services in the
school tax case. We stated that
while the case was started Septem
ber, 1899, and decided in the superior
court in October following, it was
not until February, 1901, that the
board of supervisors, upon the writ
ten request of the respondent, C.
L. Culbert, county auditor, ratified
the employment of W. J. McGee as
9pedW counsel to attend to the case
in the supreme court, the matter
being then on appeal before that tri
bunal. This latter date' should have
been February, 1900.. We are free
to admit that this apparently trivial
error changes the situation mater
ially. As the first bill for legal ser
vices, amounting to $250, was al
lowed in April, 1900, it will be seen
that this claim was presented after
.. — and not before, as our article
stated — Jhecase was appealed. Mr.
McGee says the services rendered by
him and associate counsel in the
higher court up to that time, and
included in the first bill, consisted
in a motion to dismiss the appeal on
some technical ground, which mo
tion was denied. To this extent,
therefore, we are willing to modify
our article of last week.
- When the second bill of $500 was
presented, the supervisors found
themselves in a dilemma, not of their
•own creation, but a legacy bequea ted
to them by the slipshod methods
adopted by their predecessors on the
board. A difference of opinion arose
as to the scope of the first bill.
The total of $750 seemed a large
?um for legal fees in a simple man
damus suit. It appears so to us,
• and we have no doubt the majority
of our readers will view it in that
light also. This $500 claim lacked
the approval of the district attor
ney; it was also minus his disap
proval. They were therefore left to
their own discretion. An examina
tion of the records failed to elucidate
the matter in the least. The minutes
told the simple fact that four month's
after the commencement of the ac
. tion the supervisors ratified the em
ployment of special counsel. There
,was absolutely nothing to show what
the amount of his fee should be in
the event of the case being won or
the' case being lost. Is it surpris
ing that misunderstanding should
result from Such a loose way of do
ing things. , A contract involving
the payment of money by the coun
ty should not only be in writing, but
be definite as to the amount. There
was no reason why it could not have
been made so in this case. When
the last bill for $500, therefore,
came before them ■ for action, the
supervisors' were "up against lit."
Without anything to guide them ex
cept individual memories of a discus
sion of two years ago, the super
visors had to face the ' issue squarely
by either allowing the bill, or reject
ing it and thereby assume the re
sponsibility of a lawsuit against the
county for its collection. fjnder
these circumstances the supervisors
probably took the wisest course by
allowing the bill. • If the fee is
regarded as heavier than would have
been the case had a more careful
policy been adopted at the outset,
the blame must fall upon those who
failed to fix the terms of employment
on a definite and certain basis.
We might notice another peculiar
feature of this litigation. The two
fees paid by the supervisors foot up
about twelve per cent of the total
amount involved in the suit. But
this is not all. The suit was to set
tle a dispute between two branches
of the local government. So that
each side was backed by public
money. It has been stated that the
school trustees in employing attor
neys to represent their side of the
controversy agreed to pay them
$1500 if they won the case, and a
small fee— slso it is said — if they
lost. In one respect, therefore, the
school fathers were wiser than the
county fathers— they did fix the fee
schedule definitely, and also od an
exceedingly liberal scale provided
the battle terminated in their favor.
So that if the trustees won, the fees
and expenses on both sides would
have agregated about $2000, or
nearly one-third of the sum involved.
We cannot assume that the suit was
started with any risk financially on
the part of those who started it.
The county treasury— the school
funds on the one side, and the cur
rent expense fund on theother— must
bear the burden of both the winning
and the losing side. Let us hope we
have seen the last for a long time of
the disastrous game of playing one
fund against theother, with the tax
payers in the comical role of footing
all the bills.
THE ROAD QUESTION.
A petition is pending before the
board of_supervisors for the opening
up of a new public road to provide
an outlet for the timber and other
resources in the neighborhood of the
Amador Lumber Company's mill in
the eastern • section of the county.
The company is willing to bear a
large proportion of the cost of con
structing this thoroughfare! and ap
peals to the county to furnish the
rest. Curiously, this very reason
able appeal has raised a great hue
and cry in opposition. It is de
nounced as an unheard-of proposi
tion; as unjust, because it proposes
to use the public money to promote
the business interests of a corpora
tion; that this corporation is coYn
posed of wealthy individuals who are
well able to bear the entire expense;
that from the early days of Amador
county the lumber aien have been
compelled to shoulder the entire bur
den of road making to get their
product to market, and therefore
the same policy should be continued
indefinitely.
It seems to us that all these posi
tions are untenable, and inapplicable
to the conditions existing in this
county to-day. We are not sufficient
ly acquainted with the conditions ex
isting in the country through which
the proposed new road must pass,
and hence we are not prepared to say
whether or not the circumstances
warrant the county in shouldering
the expense of several miles of ad
ditional roadway. But we have no
hesitation in saying that if this road
is necessary to the development of
the lumber industry in a heavily
timbered country, and that the im
proved transportation facilities to
be thus created will alone enable
our local lumber men to compete
with outsiders for the trade of the
mineral belt, the assistance asked
is but a small matter compared with
the advantages to be gained.
It is the business of the county to
provide roads. The county cannot
injustice, either in whole or in part,
shift that duty upon private parties.
To say that a few private persons or
a corporation will be benefitted by
thenew road is not a solid objection.
The same might be said of every new
road that has ever been opened at
public expense. Indeed, that is the
very object of road building— that
private or corporate enterprises may
be encouraged, and individuals bene
fitted. In proportion as this result
is secured the county is also bene
fitted by the increase of taxable
wealth. And that is the only way
in which the county, as a county,
can receive benefit from roads. As
an abstract proposition, a county as
such has no use for roads. The only
use it can make" of them is to keep
them in repair; and this is done for
individual convenience and profit.
It makes no difference so far as
the principle is concerned whether
the individuals be few or many; in
their aggregate capacity they are
termed the public/ .•
To revert to the experience of early
days is not in order. Then the local
millmen monopolized the local mar
ket. To bring lumber from the out
side was out of the question. The
profits of the business might then
justify the sawmill owners in making
roads at their own expense. They
had to do this or lose the trade, for
the county was too poor in taxable
property to build the highways re
quired. In those piping times' of
private road building the county was
a network of tollroads. Every few
miles the traveler would run up
against a toll gate. These are
times to be remembered, but not to
be patterned after.
One point more. It is said that
the stockholders of the lumber com
pany seeking this new outlet, are
wealthy, and able to bear the entire
cost. Admitting this to be true,
what of it? They pay taxes accord
ing to the value of their taxable
property. If they have more than
others, they are called upon to pay
more, not only for roads but for all
other purposes of government. To
force them to bear, in order to do
business in our midst, additional
burdens not contemplated by law is
a system of oppression under which
no community can hope to thrive. '
We repeat, we are not advocating
the granting of the lumber com
pany's request, because we are cot
sufficiently acquainted with the tim
ber region involved to form a fairly
correct estimate of the possibilities
of trade that might be opened up
thereby. As a rule, the .Ledger is
opposed to multiplying roads in well
settled sections of the county. But
we know that a different rule must
apply to the undeveloped eastern
portion of the county. If the mag
nificent forests of pine, now virgin
and silent, can be made a hive of in
dusty, giving employment to hun
dreds of men and imparting new
life to the entire country between
the forests and the mining belt, and
distributing among our own people
for [many years to come tens of
thousands of dollars annually that
now go to enrich outside dealers, the
assistance asked from the county
is unworthy of mention when com
pared with the business revival in
sight.

Prospecting,; in [ Alaska.
On the 3rd of ' July last, five pf us in
party, started on a prospecting tour,
heading for' Hasting creek. We had'
an option upon two claims there- as a
lay, agreeing to give 20 per cent of the
gross proceeds, to the owner 'of* the
claims, If we found anything to justify
us in taking hold 'of them. The place
was eighteen miles south from Nome.
We had amongst us a boat capable of
carrying a ton's weight, besides the
oarsman. But not a mother's son of
us kuew anything about boating. One
of our partners, j. E. Stone, had some
business to attend to at Nome and
could not go for a day or two, so he
hired a sailor to go in his place, which,
figuratively speaking, "pTitusin town."
Our provisions, tools, bedding, etc.,
were put into the boat and we wore
ready to launch her, it beinjf impossi
ble to put anything in a boat even in
the calmest time that can ho found and
let it stay in the water. The surf came
rolling gently scroll like inward and
all bands took hold of the boat to push
it into the water. The sailor, and one
of our party, got into the boat, oars in
hand, ready to push out into the sea
whenever we could force it beyond the
inrolling surf, columns that came with
a periodical," momentary splash upon
the smooth sandy shore. ''Pull for the
sea, you sky -lark, " Stone shouted, as
he helped to launch the boat. • The
two men leaned with all their strength
on the- oars, and over the inrolling
surf she started with a dive seaward,
and she was now properly en tho wave.
The sailor pushed seaward beyond the
inrolling surf and headed, bird like,
southward. The other three of us,
considering that a sandy shore was
better than a watery grave or a good
ducking, "hoofed" it along the shore,
following the boat. • Earneatly speak
ing-, the Behringe sea is so treacherous
that raon in small boats are too often
in the power of a merciless \*ave, that
may swallow them up forever in a sec
ond. At times the sea, like a huge
leviathan, lies for a short period so
still as to appear to be resting in deep
est slumber; then, without warning, it
awakens as if disturbed from a peace
ful rest, and in its fury lashes the waves
into wrathful columns of furious waves
and seething foam, sending everything
upon it unprotected to destruction and
death. On the Ist of Ju'y last two
sailors with their- row boat was upset
and one of them drowned. A woman
and her fourteen year old son were
foolish enough to venture out for a
pleasant ride along close to the shore.
Suddenly tho sea grew rough and in
its wrath swallowed up the boat and
left two corpses to drift and be thrown
—God knows where— beneath the
surges of the furious waves. A half a
hundred, without a doubt, have lost
their lives in the last two years in this
treacherous sea by being out in row
boats.' No wonder, then, we watched
with solicitude our tiny craft, freighted
with our belongings and two human
souls, as she skipped . like a. sea-bird
over the treacherous deep.. "Look at
her!" said Stone. She. was now a mere
speck, and as she followed the troughs
of the sea she disappeared and seemed
momentarily to have " dived beneath
the waves; 'but way out upon the crest
of the rolling surf we saw her reappear
as a tiny spectral form, fleeing liko
some hunted shadow. Gone! she was
lost to our sight in the distance. Along
the shore we followed our departod
craft. About two and a half miles
from Nome a whale lay dead upon' the
shorn. It was thirty or forty feot
long, and some men jnrere cutting, great
slabs out of it for food for two or tttree
hundred dogs housed in a great pen a
half mile back of Nome. "Look there"
said one of my partners, as we traveled
onward. I looked; a long, bright new
oar was being rolled back and forth
upon the beach by the actions of the
waves. We secured the oar, and nat
urally .enough scanned the ocean, in
search of some derelect tiny craft that
we thought might be wandering aim
lessly at sea; but nothing could we see
save the wide expanse of the ocean, or
the transport Warren as she lay at
anchor, opposite the government bar
racks nearly ten miles away. Just
above the barracks that are situated
on. the beach, beyond the- mouth of
Nome river, I picked up at the water's
edge nearly a new shoe that was yet
wet with ocean surf. It doubtless was
connected with' the oar and went to tell
the tale of horror and death. It is
known to be a fact that a drowned-at
sea man will be stripped of his boots or
shoes by the action of ■ tho waves. A
little further up the beach I found a
new buckskin purse that- had caught
on a buried stick and was fluttering as
if trying to get away from the almost
spent wavelets that played about., All
that it contained was some ocean sand
that had forced itself within. I emptied
the sand out of the purse, washed it,
and now retain it as a souvenir.
Two of us stopped to talk to a sol
dier and the others walked along.
After leaving the soldier we walked for
some time along the sandy beach with
steady, worried tread. On suddenly
looking up we saw our two partners
ahead grabbing at" something, then
springing out of the way of the incom
ing surf. As we got a little closer we
saw they were fishing. Hastening for
ward we saw such a sight of fish as we
never saw before. There were billions
of them. If I had only possessod a
common garden rake I could have se
cured a barrel full iv ten minutes. The
rolling columns of water that rolled
and scrolled backwards and forwards
was a living mass of struggling smelt.
Luckily, I had a. gold pan carrying
that had not been put in^the boat,
which we filled and went^ trudging on
ward." A quarter of a mile ahead a
man was seen coming toward us. When
we got close enough we saw it was the
sailor, the pilot of our craft. When in
speaking distance, in chorus, we asked
in the deepost anxiety, "What's the
•matter!" "Nothing," ho answered,
with a smile, "tho boat is at the mouth
of Hastingcreek, and your things safely
laid on shore. Good bye, boys, and
good luck to you, I must go back to
Nome to-night." With a . steady,
swinging tread, he passed on toward
Nome. When we got to Hasting creek
we were surprised to find that our part
ner and the sailor had stretched the
tonts. and everything was beside thorn
ready to be taken in. Hasting creek
is a loiig flat creek whose serpentine
windings twist its way toward the clear
blue mountains to the north. Iv the
Uoop gaps of the mountains, glacial ice
sparkle and scintillate in the sunlight.
Tho tundra on iv sides welter in water
and as one's foot is set down upon it
tdo water spurts with a sissing sound
from under. A good deal of wood lay
upon the beach, thrown into inconceiv
able shape together. This wood had
come down the great Yukon, and car
ried inward by the sea; is driven by
high tide up Hasting creek, and left
upon the shore by the receding waves.
Close to our tent, a man, his wife
and two children had stayed the long
cold winter. The little boy, five or six
years old, was soon at the tent. His
loquacity run to overflowing.- He could
ask more questions in one minute than
a criminal lawyer could ask in the most
desperuU) uivsti examination in ton.
I smiled at the boy's interlocutions, for
his tongue was a veritable chatterbox.
"Was it cold here this winter?" I
queried. "Don't know, " he answered,
"Mom didn't let me out to see."
"Much ice?" I asked. "Golly! yes, all
ice around here." As he finished, his
mother's voice saner out clear and dis
tinct in the distance, summoning him
to. supper. Ho sprang like a deer to
his feet, and with boyish delight he
bounded along the sandy beach home
ward. We now proceeded to "cook
supper. We fried a great mess" of fish,
and when I tasted them I said to my
partners that they equaled the moun
tain trout of California. If I had had
that school of smelt close to Amador, I
would f have turned fish monger and
supplied Amador county with a surfeit
of fish that would have sent the price
of mountain trout down in the scales
with a jerk. The next morning was
the 4th of July. No guns boomed out
with joyous greeting; no happy voices
rang along crowded, streets. We were
in the wilds of Alaska with a heavy
rain pattering down upon the tent. A
heavy fog hung like a mantle o'er the
ocean, shutting out the. sight of the
waves that, bellowed • with continuous
roar in our ears. .
Putting on our gum suits we started
up Hasting 'creek. Half a mile from
our camp "we found the creek bedded
in ice The water had cut a channel
through it in places six or eight foot
deep. We did not feel as cold as might
be supposed. We met the fresh pure
air without a shiver or a shudder, and
looked o'er the' vast ice bed with de
light. The earth- close to the creek
was frozen hard as a stone. Tho stream
with its tributaries were so flat as to
appear to be almost level, and little
lakelets stood in silvery sheets every
whore. Not an atom of life matter did
we see, save a solitary duck winging
his way southward. To dig; as well
try to dig in pig N iron as the hard
frozen ground on the creek. We turn
ed back to camp satisfied that no pros
pecting could bo done here for a month.
The rain had fallen heavily all day,
and we were glad to be beneath the
shelter of the tent. We lit a fire in'
our Yukon stove and cooked our
evening meal. The rain continued to
fall heavily all day and without a mom
ent of intermission. Wrapt in our
wolf skin robe we fell into a deep,
peaceful slumber, while the storm
played in all its fury without.

Splendid Attraction Coming.
"A Trip to the Circus" is one of the
attractions which has made a hit in
the East during the past season. It is
now touring the Pacific Coast under
the direction and management of
Homer E. Guilbault, one of the most
successful and enterprising of the pres
ent generation of actor managers, and
whose name is a guarantee of its being
a high class attraction.
The play is one of rare fascination
and its dramatic features are well in
terspersed with natural comedy and
character humor. The latest of spec
ialtios are introduced. The company
is composed of fourteen people, in addi
tion to which it carries its own band
and orchestra, and full settings of scen
ery and stage mountings.

Successful Operation.
Will Korr of Sutter Creek, an enter
prising young livery man, returned to
Suttor Monday evening from a trip to
San Francisco, where he underwent an
operation on his left eye on February
10th. Dr. Gall, after making an exam
ination of the trouble, advised Mr.
Kerr to seek the skill of Dr. Powers,
one of the noted oculists of the city.
The operation was highly satisfactory
to all concerned, and though still suffer
ing somewhat from the effects, the
affected organ is rapidly improving.
Painful Accident.

upon, by the infuriated beast. Dr.
Tiffany was called to dress the wounds.
Mr. Clark is in a serious condition,
rendered more so on account of his
advanced age.
School Closed.

cases of measles have developed in
Drytown, one of which is the case of

Remarkable Mortality Coincidence.
A singular fatality coincidence, con
cerning two brothers, young men born
and raised in Amador couuty and well
known in Sutter Creek and Jackson,
was telegraphed from Los Angeles last
Friday. On that day Roy Watkins of
Sutter Creek received a message from
a married sister, in Los Angeles that
his brother George, . more generally
known as 'Buz,' died In that city
that morning; and also that a younger
brother, Bert, died in Arizona the
same day,' the two deaths occurring
within about an hour of each other.
Buz Watkins loft Jackson three weeks
ago last Monday. He was then suf
fering from consumption in an ad
vanced stage of that dread disease. He
had been in the county hospital for
about a week, and made tbe journey to
the southern city on the invitation of
a married sister to make his home with
her, and in the hope that the change
of air might prove beneficial. It was
evident to his friends when he left here
that the end was not far off. The re
mains were forwarded to Sutter Creek,
where the funeral took place last Sun
day, the body finding its last rest in
the family plot where his parents are
buried. Of the death of Bert, Watkins
we have been informed that be was run
over by a train and instantly killed at
Gila, Arizona. His remains reached
Sutter Creek Tuesday evening, and
were buried by the side of his brother
on Wednesday afternoon. "• :; ":-'_
Both were single men, and were born
and spent thoir boyhood days together
on the old Watkins homestead on Sut
ter hill.
The Report Abont a Mew Bank.
A statement has been published to
the effect that there was a movement
on foot for the organization of another
bank in Jacksou. We are in a position
to state that such a report has no foun
dation whatever. A proposition was
started to buy out the bank of Jackson
Dennis in Sutter Creek, and Jackson
parties were willing to subscribe to the
movement provided Jackson was in
cluded. The idea was to buy both the
Jackson and Sutter Creek financial in
stitutions, and still continue both banks
under one strong corporation, with a
capital or at least $100,000. Such a
bank, with the backing of the principal
capitalists of the county behind it,
would, it was thought, command the
utmost confidence of the business com
munity, and practically control the
banking business of the county. The
idea of starting an opposition bank at
the county seat was never seriously en •
tertained. The Jackson bank has been
ably conducted, and has done, and is
still doing, a very profitable business
considering the amount of capital em
ployed. But it was argued that the
business might bo materially increased
under the same management by in
creasing the capital stock. For rea
sons which we are' not called upon to
explain, the arrangements could not
be effected at present, so the matter
remains .in abeyance for a time, but
cannot be said to have been dropped
altogether. -

Those Water Tanka and Pipe.
A meeting has been called of the sub-,
scribers to the fund for sprinkling the
lone road, to meet in the supervisors'
room in the Hall of Records, Jackson,
on Wednesday evening next, at eight
o'clock. The object of the meeting, as
we understand it, is to ascertain the
wishes of the subscribers as to what
disposition shall be made of the pipe
and watering tanks now strung along
the lone road. Shall they be permit
ted to remain where they are and de
teriorate in value, or shall they be sold
and the money realized therefrom used
for the permanent betterment of tho
road. While the supervisors have full
power over the matter, still it is only
natural that they should seek to keep
iv touch with the desires of their con
stituencies. It should be borne in mind,
however, that the property belongs to
county, and* the supervisors have full
power to take such action as they deem
proper to protect tho interests of the
county. If the property is allowed to
become valueless, they Slone will have
to shoulder the responsibility.
A New Concentrator.
George Gates returned to Jackson
Wednesday night after'an absence of
six months, during which time ho has
been in San Francisco perfecting a new
concentrator. The new'machino bids
fair to out-class all present contriv
ances for the work for which it is de
signed. Mr. Gates is an authority on
the sulphurets question, and the untir
ing efforts put forth by him in this
direction deserve reward. Owing to
the superiority of the sulphurets of
that district_the first plant equipped
with the new machines will be built
at Salt Lake, Utah. Mr. Gates brought
with him the model of the invention,
which is designed to produce the ma
chine motion. At the National Hotel
he exhibited it to a few of his admiring
friends. It is indeed unique and appar
ently complete in every particular.
He was accompanied to Jackson by
his son.
Rainfall.
The rainfall, as measured by the
gauge kept at the Ledger office, is as
follows:
February 13 0.30
February 14...... 0.32

Same period last year 20.41
The rainfall, although considerably
below that of last year, has been time
ly and seasonable. The outlook for
feed and crops of all kinds was never
better at this season of the year. The
snowfall in the mountains, however, is
reported unusually light.

THE SMALLPOX SITUATION
The Board of Supervisors
'Take Action.
They Meet in Special Session and Ap
point a Health Officer—Quaran
tine Established.
', A special meeting of tho board of
supervisors was hold iv Jacksou last
Fridaj, for tho purpose of taking some
action in relation to the epidemic of
smallpox in ■ Sutter Creok. All tho
members were present.
A communication was read from Dr.
W. J. Hanna, representing the state
board of health, touching tho condi
tion of affairs ii\ Sutter Crock.
Senator John F. Davis appeared as a
citizen and addressed tho board.
District Attorney Vieiiii, also Drs. E.
E. Endicott and A. M. Gall stated the
situation as they found it. ■*
It was moved and seconded that Dr.
A. M. Gall bo appointed county health
officer for Amador county at a salary
of .SSO per month for tho purpose of
taking charge, of all contagious dis
eases. - • " ';
Dr. Gall at first declined the honor,
and suggested that some physician in
Sutter Creek bo appointed.
A vote was thereupon taken on tho
motion for the appointment of Dr. Gall
with tbo folio wiug result: Ayes — M.
Newman, F. B. LoMoin, and A. B. Mc-
Laugblin; noes, VV. M. Amick and E.
B. Moore. - ' ■ .
Dr. Gall was thereupon declared duly
elected, said appointment to take effect
immediately. '
Dr. Gall withdrew bis objections and
accepted the appointment. :.',.-
Supervisors Moore and' Aralck ex
plained their votes on this mailer by
stating that they wanted a health
officer .for each township.
Moved and seconded that no claims
against the county iv relation to con
tagious diseases will be allowed unless
the same are authorized and approved
by the county health officer and dis
trict attorney. Carried by a unani
mous vole of the board.
THE SITUATION IN SUTTER CREEK.
• Dr. Gall went over to Sutter Creek
as health officer on Saturday morn
ing, and quarantined eight or nine
residences. Others who had been ox-
posed to the disease were subjected to
a thorough fumigation. • School has
been temporarily closed, and every
precaution has been taken to guard
against tho further spread of the dis
ease. The cases are all of a mild txpe.
There is little doubt that with ordinary
precaution tho contagion will be con
fined within its present narrow limits.
There is no outcry for harsh measures
of non-intercourse with the afflicted
town. Persons circulate between Sut
ter and neighboring towns on business
almost the same as before. The truth
is there is no longer . that exagger
ated dread of this disease in tho
public mind that existed a few years
back. In a short time we ox poet to bo
able to announce that the county is
again rid of this unwelcome visitor.

MINING NEWS.
California has never paid much atten
tion to Alpine county; but that does
not alter tho fact that this little corner
of tho Golden State is going to be hoard
from very shortly. With the promise
of a sixty -stamp quartz mill to be
pounding away rup there next summer,
t hero is likely to be a surprise in store
for those who have not counted upon
Alpine county as a possible bullion
producer. — Gardnervillo Record.
Kennedy.— They_ have finished cut
ting stations and building chutes at the
2400 and 2500 levels of the east shaft.
The chutes are huge affairs, estimated
to hold about 1000 tons* of rock each.
Crosscutting toward the north' shaft
has been started from both 2400 and
2500 levels, the latter has been ad
vanced about 25 feet The total depth
of the east shaft is 2630 feet —by
far the deepest on the mother lode.
About 30 men are employed in and
around this shaft. The talk is that
a new 60 stamp mill will be started
the coming summer. The Kennedy is
a great mine, and promises to be a
still greater bullion producer and em
ployer of labor in the future.
The suit of the Argonaut against the
Kennedy Mining Company will be heard
in tho United States supreme court in
April next. J udga Lindley will argue
the case for tho Argonaut company and
Judge Garber is expected to appear for
the Kennedy. The suit has been pend
ing in the courts for eight years.
MISCELLANEOUS.
G. A. Douet is again able to be
around and has cleaned up the bed
rock which he had previously washed
off before he was taken sick. The re
sult of tho clean-up was seven pounds
of gold; value $1500.
The Edinburg tunnel is now in 100
feet in ore, which gives returns of $10
in freo gold. and 3 per cent of sulphur
ets that assay $55 per ton. The com
pany has decided to continue driving
ahead on the ledge 200 feet further.
The Amador-Phoenix mill is shut
down for tho purpose of reconstructing
tho boiler furnace, with a view of econ
omizing wood. -The improvement, -it
is contemplated, will effect a saving of
75 per cent in fuel consumption.
The Mitchell mine at Pine Grove is
still sinking and keeping ore ahead for
the future. Development of this prop
erty has boon slow but sure, inexpen
sive and profitable, without the com
mon desire to make a mine before a
claim has been prospected, which in
almost every case results disastrously
and gives our mining industry an un
justifiable black eye. Now that the
Mitchell is a long way ahead of the ex
perimental stage and giving handsojne
returns on the capital invested, numer
ous inquiries are being made about
mining property in the district. .

NEW CASES.
E. C. Long, J. M. Kile and J. A.
Plummer, vs. Zenith Mining and Devel
opment Co., W. L. Morrow and others.
— Suit for anullment of contract or to
compel performance of - same. Com
plaint alleges that plaintiffs own an un
divided two-thirds interest in the Alli
son mining claim in Plymouth district.
On the 17th of May, 1808, plaintiffs
and I. K. Garrett, by an Instrument in
writing granted to W. L. Morrow the
privilege of reducing the ore on the
dump of said mine, and the option of
purchasing the property by payment
of the .following sums: I. K. Garrett
$2000, J. M. Kile $2500, and J. A.
Plummer $2500, and allowing said Mor
row six months in which to organize a
company for that purpose. On Octo
ber, 4, 1899, Morrow assigned to the
Zenith Mining Company all interest in
said agreement. Defendants erected a
ten stamp mill on the ' property and
crushed a small quantity of ore. For
more than a year past they havo bailed
to prosecute work, and have permitted
the mine to fill with water. The mill,
completed two years ago, has been op
erated not over 40 days. On the 6th of
January plaintiffs tendered to the de
fendants' a deed, and demanded pay
ment according to contract, and they
refused to pay. Judgment is therefore
asked that the agreement be declared
void, and plaintiffs released from the
terms thereof, unless the payments are
made within such reasonable time as
the court may determine, and for costs
of suit.
The Last Heard Of It.
"My little son took the croup one
night and soon grew so bad you could
hear him breathe all over the house,"
says F. D. Reynolds, Mansfield, O.
"We feared he would die, but a few
doses of One Minute Cough Cun quick
ly relieved him and he went to sleep.
That's the last we heard of the croup.
Now isn't a cough cure like that val
uable?" One Minute Cough Cure is
absolutely safe and acts immediately.
For coughs, colds, grip, bronchitis and
all other throat and lung troubles it is
a certain cure. Very pleasant to take.

Success Due to Advertising .
The Philadelphia Record tells an
interesting story about the success
of a large general store in Wash -
iugton state. The proprietors be
gan business iv a small w»3 r , lived
economically and saved every
dollar to buy space in the news
papers. Now their advertising con
tracts call for an aggregate space of
107 pages a year. The manager of
the concern says they would as soon
think of going out of business as of
reducing their advertising space.
The experience of that firm is the
common experience of all advertis
ers. A man might as - well take
down his business signs as to stop
advertising, as might a firm.

Clerk's Wise Suggestion.
"I have lately been much troubled
with dyspepsia, belching and sour
stomach," writes M. S. Mead, leading
pharmacist of Attleboro, Mass. "I
could eat hardly anything without suf
fering several hours. My clerk sug
gested I try Kodol Dyspepsia Cure
which I did with most happy results.
I have had no more trouble and when
one can go to eating mince pie, cheese,
candy and nuts after such a time, their
digestion must be pretty good. I en
dorse Kodol Dyspepsia Cure heartily."
You don't havo to diet. Eat all tho
good food you want but don't over
load the stomach. Kodol Dyspepsia
Cure digests your food. Kerr's Phar
macy, Jackson. ,

BEAVER" TAFL SOUP.
Alllohlffan Limber Cunp Delicacy
That Amazed a Marylander.
"Although I am a Marylander and an
Eastern Shore one at\thnt," said an epi
cure from that state, "and consequent
ly know what good things to eat are, I
want to tell you that Til have to take
off my hiit f to the lumber camp cook of
the upper -Michigan peninsula ns the
discoverer, \fabrlca tor and dispenser of
a dish that! knocks the Eastern Shore
cuisine silly. And that rare lumber
camp dish is beaver tall soup.
"I was .with Colonel Park of Colum
bus, 0., dleer hunting In the Rainy lake
region of; Michigan one fall. We lived
at a lumber camp boarding shanty.
"ThereJwere signs of beaver at the
upper end of the lake, and a trapper
succeeded in trapping one of the wily
dam builders.
"When the beaver was brought into
camp, thelcanip cook went nearly wild,
and so did the lumbermen when they
heard the news, all because they had
been trying to trap a beaver for weeks,
not for its fur, but for Its tail, ns they
■wcrejpining, they said, for beaver tail
soup.
"The cook: took that broad appendage
of thp beaver, mailed like an armadillo,
tookffromMt the underlying bone and
meat, andtfrom it made such a soup as
never caine^from any other stock at the
beck of {thei most expert and scientific
chef tha* cwr put a kettle on.
"We could do the same thing and
perhaps better on the Eastern Shore,
but we lackione thing. ,AYe haven't got
the beavers ito yield us\ their tails."—

The Morals of Animal*.
It may be questioned whether ani
mals have any conception of morals
as we understand the term, but In a
general sense it would certainly seem
that they have. In the social sense
there Is no doubt as to the answer. To
take a well known Instance, the ant
family have evolved a most complicat
ed social system which apparently
works to perfection, and that la more
than can be said for any human sys
tem. In order, cleanliness, care of off
spring, provision for future wants and
military discipline no civilized society
can compare with theirs. They are
slaveholders, It is true, but they treat
their slaves with every kindness and
consideration, and the warrior ants dfr.
fend them in time of danger. .
Another excellent example is fur
nished by the beaver. During summer
it leads a solitary life, but at the ap
proach of winter communities are
formed, building operations commence,
stores are laid up as soon as the dwell
ings are completed, and every Individual
of tho wnitn'unlty recognizes clearly
that the interests of the family and
the colony come first In their family
life they, In common with many other
animals, offer' an example which might
well be copied not only by savages, but
also by civilized communities.
Beecber's Open Band.
An old member of Plymouth church
who knew Henry Ward Beecher and
his family tells a story about the
great preacher. "No one ever knew
what he did with the vast sums of
money he earned as a lecturer," he
said. "He used to give money away
with both hands, and he was as likely
to give a street beggar a twenty dollar
bill as a dollar; but bis salary from
Plymouth church went direct to Mrs.
Beecher intact. He never drew any
money from the church until the end
of the ye:-.:. ""'>r-i he received a check
for $20,000, his mil year's salary, and
handed It to his wife. When he died,
he did not leave much of an estate, al
though be had earned millions of dol
lars in his life, but Mrs. Beecher had
always received her $20,000 a year, and
she lived In comfort and even luxury
in Brooklyn till she died. He was a
great man was Henry Ward Beecher."
An Oddltr of Lost Caste.
It is not necessary to go to India to
bear curious stories of caste. In a pro
feepfonnl man's household' recently a
ajWdservam fell ill of diphtheria. Her
mistress nursed her herself through a
tedious illness until she was quite well.
When that happy result was establish
ed, the maid immediately informed the
mistress that she intended to leave her
service. The reason of the maid's de
parture was this— "l could not live -with
a mistress who has been waiting on
me herself." Quite evidently this is not
mere Indifference to kindness or in
gratitude. The girl was the slave of
that mysterious influence ■ of ; caste
which splits up into minute sections
every modern society, as it split up ev
ery ancient society, and seems likely to
split up any future society that it is
possible to imagine.— London Saturday
Review.
Lemon Extract.
A lemon extract that one is sure is
pure can be easily made at home. Grate
off enough of the outside peel of lem
ons to fill a small bottle; taking care
that none of the white part of the rind
gets in, as this will give a bitter taste.
When the bottle is full, cover with pure
alcohol and set away for three weeks.
At the end of that time the contents
of the bottle should be strained, and
the extract is ready for use. An even
teaspoonful of this preparation will
flavor a quart of custard or other sim
ilar dish.— New York Post
Their Blbl*.
A Btory is told in which the late Lord
Iddeslelgb figured when as Mr. Staf
ford Northcote he .was appointed a
magistrate for Devon. At the castle of
Exeter, where he attended to be sworn,
he was' handed a book tied round with
what had once been red tape. Not lik
ing the appearance of it, Mr. Northcote
took out his knife and cut the tape and
on opening the book discovered that !t
was a ready reckoner, on which magis
trates bad been sworn for about thirty
years.
Precious Hair.
When the crusaders returned from
the Holy Land in 1099, they were load
ed with relics of holy personages who
had previously been unknown in the
west Bohemond, one of their leaders,
divided between Anselm and certain
churches a dozen hairs which the pa

A bird of immense wing power is the
tiny stormy petrel, the smallest web

it breasts the utmost fury of the storm,

Idly over their enowy "crests. Petrels

Artist and Ploirr.mii,
Artists have many amusing and some
unpleasant experiences when trespass
ing in pursuit of subjects for their art
■\Yhen Mr. Bought on once saw a man
plowing in a field, he climbed the di
viding wall and began to sketch him.
This was too much for the involuntary
model, who strode up to the artist and
said, "Do you know what L,could do
with you?" "I haven't the* slightest
idea," Mr. Boughton answered, with a
smile.
"Well," the burly plowman said, "I
could chuck you into the road." "You'd
better not do that,". Mr. Boughton re
torted. "Why not go back to your
plow, and I'll whistle for you in half
an hour?" .
To Mr. Boughton's surprise the man
obeyed and half an hour later was duly
summoned to inspect the finished pic
ture. "How much will they give you
for that?" he asked after critically
surveying the sketch. "Oh, about
f 10!" the artist answered. "Well,
I'm hanged!" the astonished plowman
said, scratching his head in perplexity.
"I have to plow two months before I
can earn as much as that."— Tit-Bits.
When Cnrates "Were Wanted.
When one learns that curates are in
creasing so much more rapidly than
benefices, wonder is excited as to the
condition of affairs in the eighteenth
century, when enterprising ladies of
fered livings to clergymen willing to
marry them. An advertisement to this
effect appeared in the London Chroni
cle in March, 1758. The lady was rath
er particular too. The curate was to
be young, have a small fortune, be well
recommended ns to morals arid good
temper "and be firmly attached to the
present happy ' establishment." • The
living was not rich— below £100 per an
num — but the fair one was young and
agreeable. There seems a touch of
humility in the direction that answers
"may be left at the bar of the Union
Coffee House, Strand, ' directed to Z.
Z." Confidence was created by the as
surance that "the utmost secrecy and
honor may be depended upon."—Lon
don Chronicle.
'Where the Color Line Ends.
There may be mulattoes, quadroons
and octoroons, but the eighth blooded
negro is the last possibility in that pro
gression. No one has' ever seen, as far
as we can learn, a human being of one
sixteenth negro blood. No pure blood
ed Caucasian and octoroon have. been
known to have issue. Many years ago,
just after the close of the civil war,
when Bishop Newman was advocating
the amalgamation idea in New Orleans,
one of the most famous physicians and
ethnologists of that city offered a re
ward of $1,000 to any person who
would bring to his knowledge a human
being of one-sixteenth negro blood. No
one ever claimed the reward. That
particular product no man has ever yet
found on earth. From the^ octoroon the
reversion to type is the only available
direction.— Atlanta Constitution.
Excessive Politeness.
There is a man who is always apolo
gizing, and some say: "How courteous
he is! How thoughtful! A born gen
tleman!" . Know that he is a thorough
and aggressive egotist He runs against
you, he steps on your foot, he tries to
pass you on the left, he knocks your
hat as he hangs by a strap in the car,'
he sits on your coattail— what does he
not do to call attention to his own
breeding? Sometimes he throws the
accent on "beg," sometimes on "par
don." The speech is merely a rhetorical
flourish, and he has practiced all the
variations.— Boston Journal.
Consumption and Sulphur.
A German physician recommends to
consumptives the sulphur treatment
This consists in the patient living in
rooms where one or two drams of sul
phur are melted daily on a hot stove.
The first ten days there will be felt in
creased irritation and cough. These
soon decrease, and improvement is
rapidly felt, and complete cures are of
ten effected If tie disease is not too far
advanced. .

A BUDDING HUMORIST>~-*
Slerry Memories of a Pint meeting
With Aitemm 'Ward. -
On going Into the Cleveland Plain
Dealer editorial rooms one morning I
saw a new man, who was introduced
to me as Mr. Browne.
He was young, clfperful in manner,
tall and slender, not quite up to date
in style of dress, . yet by- no means
shabby. His hah* was flaxen and very
straight; his nose, the prominent fea
ture of his face, was Romanesque—
quite violently so— and with a leaning
to the left His eyes were blue gray,
XVith a twinkle in them; his mouth
seemed so given to a merry laugh, so
much in motion, that it was difficult
to describe. . "-
It seemed as though bubbling In him
was a lot of happiness which he made
no effort to conceal or hold back.
When we were introduced, he was sit
ting at his table writing. He gave his
leg a smart slap, arose, shook hands
with me and said he was glad to meet
me. I believed him, for he looked glad
all the time. You could not look at
him but he would laugh. He laughed
as he sat at his table writing. When
he had written a thing which pleased
him, he would slap his leg and laugh.
I noticed that George Hoyt and
James Brokenshire at their tables were
pleased with his merriment and in
dulged in broad smiles. As I bade him
and the others good morning he said,
'.'Come again, me liege.". I thanked
him, said I would and went my way,
thinking what a funny fellow he was.
Within a month thereafter appeared
in the columns of The Plain Dealer a
funny letter signed "Artemus Word."
The writer said he was in the show
business, had a trained kangaroo, "a
most amoosln' little cuss," some
"snaix" and a collection of wax fig
ures, which he called a "great moral
show." As he was coming to Cleve
land to exhibit he made a proposition
to the proprietor that they "scratch
each other's backs"— the publisher to
write up the show vigorously and the
showman to have the handbills print
ed at his office and give him free tick
ets for all his family. So I found my
young friend of the gurgle and hay
colored hair to be an embryo humorist
Just bursting into bloom. Artemus, as
from that time he was best known,
soon had a city full of friends, myself
and family among them.— James P.
