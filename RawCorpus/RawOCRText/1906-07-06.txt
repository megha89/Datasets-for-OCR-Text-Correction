What Rusts Iron.— Spectacular Bubble
Blowing.— One Atmospheric Fertil
izer.—Color Distinguishing Glasses.
—Puzzling Horns.— Firing Mines by
a Whistle.— Radium Tinted Gems.—
Not Artificial Life.— Odd Skull
Mending.
So familiar a process as the rusting
of iron appears to have been mis
understood. The presence of moisture
and oxygen has been regarded as the
condition necessary, and the old idea
that carbonic acid plays a part has
been quite generally discarded. A
different view has just been brought
before the London Chemical Society
by Mr Gerald Moody. In very care
ful experiments, a piece of polished
iron was exposed to distilled water
and a continuous current of air
freed from carbonic acid and the
metal continued untarnished at the
end of six weeks. When air with
the normal carbonic acid was drawn
ovei the sample, however, and was
covered with deep red rust in seventy
two hours.
The bubble fountain is an English
scientiUc novelty, said to be capable
of blowing 20.000 soap bubbles per
minute. Coal gas may be used, anil a
very striking effect can bo obtained
at night by firing the gas at the
fountain, when the flame will run
up the stream of bubbles. Inter
mittent groups of bubbles are suggest
ed for gun practice, as they are
cheaper than bales of glass or clay,
and their use is more humane than
the murder of live pigeons.
Calcium cyanamide, known to the
Germans as kalkstlckoff, is one of the
aritUcial fertilizers that is expected
to take the place of Chilean saltpeter
and Peruvian guano. It is a com
pound of calcium carbide with atmos
pheric nitrogen, and is msde by
liquefying air, distilling off the
oxygen, and introducing the nitrogen
into lime and coke at high tempera
ture.
In two years French florists change
the violet into a two-foot tree, carry
ing 25 to 300 flowers throughout the
year.
While glasses cannot tit the color
blind for observing signals at sea or
on railways, HerrPicbon, of Cologne,
finds that much assistance may be
given in distinguishing between
colors. Persons having the common
form of color blindness require red
and green glasses, as the led glass
absorbs green rays and causes red
objects to appear lighter than to the
naked eye, and the green glass ab
sorbs ied rays and adds to the- bright
ness of green objects. Those who are
color blind to yellow and blue can
be similarly helped by glasses of
yellow or blue. In cases of color
blindness to all colors, three ditteieut
glasses— red, green and violet— aie
necessary, and these can be combined
in pairs so as to give twelve different
shades, making possible very accurate
determinations. In a special kind of
color blindness, disease of the retina
causes utter inability to distinguish
blue, and an affection of the optic
nerve makes it impossible to see red.
A recently acquired abnormality of
the British museum is the skull of
an English horse, showing a pair of
rudimentaiy horns on .the forehead.
Older specimens are a portion of a
similar skull with the horns and
models of the foreheads of two [thor
oughbreds also having horns. The
skin extends uniformly over the
horns, with no sign of thickening or
hardening. Just what these horn
like growths signify is perplexing
naturalists, as none of the ancestral
horses or immediately related species
were horned animals, and if there is
no hereditary influence it is remark
able that so many freak appendages
should appear in the same place.
A curious new device for exploding
mines at some distance is operated by
waves of sound. In the interior of a
cylindrical resonator a disc is so
mounted es to be free to turn about
its diameter, and when a certain note
is founded this disc will place itself
in a plane perpendicular to the
cylinder. iiy causing the turning
disc to complete an eloctric circuit,
a mine can be exploded by means of
a signal given by warships' siren
tuned to the same vote as the re
sonator.
Many precious stones show a re
markable change of color in the pre
sence of radium. In late German ex
periments a colorless diamond from
Borneo became pale yellow after an
exposure of eight days to impure
radium bromide, deeper yellow in
eight days more, and was not wholly
restored to its original colorlessness
by heating to rudness. The light
blue of a sapphiro turned to green in
two hours, then to yellow, reddish
yellow, and after fourteen days, to
yellowish brown. The color dis
appeared on heating, a light yellow
invariably reappearing, however, when
the stone became cold. The rays did
not affect the color of the amethyst,
ruby, blue topaz, or chrysoberyl; but
a tourmaline with a green end became
green at any other point on which
the rays acted.
The radiobes of Mr. J. B. Burke
have proven a scientific puzzle, even
if they have not been widely accepted
as living organisms. The explanation
of Sir William Ramsay that the
JACKSON, AMADOU COUNTY. CALIjrOirNIA, FRIDAY. JULY 6, 1906.
forms growing and dividing in
gelatine are helium bubbles from
disintegrating radium is far from
convincing. A new theory from Mr.
W. A. D. Rudge, another British
physicist, is that the growths form
only when sulphuric acid is pioseut
and as a result of tbe diflusion and
precipitation of barium or other
element forming insoluble sulphates.
Most radium preparations contain
much barium. Tbe new experiments
have shown that when the gelatine is
freed from sulphuric acid no growths
are produced by other elements, but
that even water from the street mains
contain sulphates enough to. start
radiobes in gelatine containing rad
ium salts.
A novel bone-grafting operation is
reported from Egypt by Dr. Voronotf.
The removal of a tumor left a large
hole in the rear of the skull, and
iustead of inserting the usual metal
plate the surgeon decided to try a
piece of the shoulder-blade of a live
sheep. The wound healed promptly,
when the accurately-fitted graft was
found to be perfectly joined to the
suirounding skull.
Exaggerated Reports.
Never has California loyalty and,
we may add, good seuse — been so put
to test as by the catastrophe that has
torn the very heart of the Golden
State, and. sad to say, it was her
youug men who were i' mud wanting,
because they were "bone of her bone
and flesh of her flesb," they were
clever euougb to do the dastardly
things they have done, and blindly
they straggled to show just how
clever they were, regardless of the
fact that every sensational untruth
was another blow to a city already
stricken, aud a smirch on California's
fair fame Every college-bred youth
with literary aspirations saw in this
earthquake a chance to wield the
muck-rake of sensational English,
and tho stench stirred by these young
pen-farmers has not yet abated. It
will be long before California re
covers from the fire that laid San
Francisco low. But it will be longer
before she can recover fiom the
elfects of the bombastic untruths of
her adolescent literary sons.
One Oakland chap, of whom better
things might have been expected,
wrote a description of the Han Fran
cisco disaster for a New York journal.
He has since been given a position
on the staff of the great eastern daily,
and in his eagerness to show himself
sufficiently equipped for the then
coveted position he made little of the
lire — which, though the greatest in
history, was only a fire— and took for
his trial theme the earthquake,
more susceptible to distortion, its
very uniqueness adding to its inter
est. In tho midst of an awful inferno
he saw nothing but the effects of the
earthquake; to his sensation-seeking
eye every fallen chimney was a wreck
ed building, every tiny crack a vast
chasm. As his young mind thrived
on yellow matter, he sought for
buildings worthy ot his mettle, to
tear down; so he took a tilt at tbe
Call building and lo! it quivered and
swayed like some grand old giant
oak, and then, powerless against so
strong an imagination, measured its
length across Market street, burying
thirty or forty people in its ruins!
Uf such as these is the kingdom of
heaven not made, but tbe Loid loveth
them just the same, when they work
cheerfully.
For tbe benefit of the stranger
whose eyes may rest on these columns
it is stated that tbe beacon light
whioh has glowed nightly tor years
from the dome of the Call building,
still shines like a star of hope from
early dark to dawn, and that the
floors are being rapidly replaced on
the steel girders that were bared by
the fire, but undistrubed absolutely
by the temblor.— Oakland Once A

A Unique Invention.
Arthur Mills aud E. F. Smith of
Mt. Aukum were in Placerville
Tuesday, and expected to remain for
a few days. They are preparing to
organized a company to manufacture
and introduce the gasoline wagon
recently pateuted and tested by Mr.
Mills, which has been briefly de
scribed in these columns.
Mr. Mills has a blacksmith shop
in Amador county, near our bound
ary. He is the inventor of a wagon
having four wheels, all of the same
size and revolving on axles, the
machine being driven by an- ordinary
gasoline engine. The machine was
successful at the first trial, making a
trip to Sacramento and back, sur
mounting very easily the grades on
ordinary mountain roads, and getting
around the curves with ease, pulling
a load equivalent to that of from
tour to six horses at an expense of
about $1.50 per day. The machine
was coupled so that it was about
twenty-one feet long, and carried
loads as well as pulled them, but in
spite ot its great length it could be
turned in any space where a two-horse
wagon can be got around.
Nothing liko this vehicle is to be
found in the United States, or pro
bably in the world, at the present
time, and it ought to have a great
field of usefulness. — El Dorado Ke

Washington
Letter.
(From Our Kegular Correspondent. )
Washington D. C. June 30, 1906.
Now that the type of canal to be
built at Panama has been settled, it
would seem that there is nothing in
the way of quick action. The presi
dent is reported to have told the
commission, "Mow out loose and
dig." This is what the whole
country will be expecting of them,
and with all the money that has been
spent in preparation, and this
country has not been niggardly, it
would eeem that the real work ought
to go on. There is one serious con
tingency. The railroad interests are
as much opposed to the canal as ever.
They cannot hope to defeat it in the
long run, but there are wayß still in
which they can obstruct and delay.
They may be depended on to hamper
appropriations whenever they can,
to gouge the government all they can
when it comes to selling supplies,
for the same men who control the
great trans-continental roads are the
dominant factors in the great indus
tries from which the canal commission
will have to draw its supplies. They
will also be on the lookout always
for the least breath of scandal in the
management or the disbursements in
Panama. And if they could only stir
up a scandal and a long-winded
ofllcial inquiry into doings on the
isthmus, it would suit their purpose
and hinder the work more effectually
than anything else. Little doubt is
expressed at the war department,
however that the work is in such
shape that it can now be pushed
effectually. And it is believed that
the organization is such that it will
produce the best results from a rea
sonable expenditure.
In all probability the interstate
commerce commission's investigation
into the coal and oil carrying roads
is concluded tor the summer. After
hearing the last of this week Mr. Jas.
G. Gardner of the Erie railroad, the
commission adjourned the hearings
without fixing a day tor resumption.
This was taken to mean that there
would be no more hearings till fall,
for the past three months the com
mission has had to largely neglect its
regular work while carrying out the
mandate of the Tillman-Gillespie
oint resolution, and it has accumul
ted plenty ot evidence to keep it
busy all summer collating and arrang
ng it in form for a report. Some of
the conditions that have been reveal] \
ed have been scandalous. Tbeie has ,
been all sorts of graft and crooked- |
ness discovered among officials both j
high and low.
But the last witness heard, Mr.
Gardner, said a word for the rail
road ownership of. coal lands that
was one of the most important said
on that side during the entire hear
ing. He pointed out that the veiy
existence of a railroad depended on
its fuel snpply, first on having a
steady supply, and then on getting
it at the lowest figure so as to curtail
the heaviest of all its operating ex
penses. He added some "hot air" on
the subject of the public getting
the benefit of the saving in this
direction, but that question is
rather beside the mark. What he did
point out, however, was that the
road he represented as a coal expert
owned and operated four coal com
panies, and made no secret of it.
They were able to draw from these
mines about half ot the three million
tons used annually. He said j that
without them, the road would be
almost crippled, and that they were
looking tor more coal lands, and
would* buy them as soon as they
could get hold ot them. He pointed
out further that the roads' coal con
sumption was growing all the time
and that if it kept up at the present
rate, they would in the course of the
next generation, be usiug ten million
tons of coal yearly, and that by this
time the present mines would be
about worked out. He said, there
fore, that the ownership ot coal lands
by railroads, for fuel purposes at
least, was justifiable, and that it was a
necessity that would have to be
reckoned with in framing any law on
the subject.
Beside the coal and oil report that
the president and the next congress
will have on their bands, there will
be also the question of what shall be
done with or to the Standard Oil
Company. The whole of a long
cabinet meeting toward the end ot
this week was devoted to the con
sideration of this problem. It has
been known for a long time that the
department of justice had been tak
ing steps in view ot commissioner
Wai-field's oil report looking to the
prosecution of the Standard under
the Elkius law or the Sherman law
or both. It was generally expected
when the cabinet meeting was over
that the attorney general would have
some statement to make on the sub
ject of the expected prosecutions,
that is whether he would or whether
he would not prosecute. But he
said that he would have to give the
matter further consideration before
making a statement, and the matter
had to go over.
It has been definitely settled that
the president will leave for Oyster
bay within two days after congress
adjourns. He has bad a strenuous
winter, and a more strenuous spring,
and he is about tired out, or as near
it as such a glutton for work ever
gets. The Koosevelt children are
already safe at the summer home
under the care of the governess and
the servants, and the president will
follow them with Mrs. Koosevelt as
soon as he can get rid of the national
legislature.
The appropiation bills are nearing
completion, but the house persistent
ly stuck to its resolution not to
sanction the new §10,000,000 battle
ship till it had more deHnite informa
tion on which to proceed. And the
matter has been allowed to go over
till next year, when the secretary
of the navy will present detailed
plans for the great fighting machine.
From Our Exchanges
The parties interested in the Valley
Spring railroad extension have been
actively at work this week, and all the
signs point to an early commence
ment of the work. Last Wednesday a
party comprising Mr. Brunuer, the
big banker who is behind tbe financial
end of the enterprise, Mr Solinsky
and several others who are heavily in
terested, came up on the train to Bur
son, where they took carriages and
drove to Mokelumne Hill. At that
place they were joined by H.S. Blood,
who is also one of the leading men in
the enterprise, and the party went
over the proposed line ot the road.
We are promised further details of
the plans of the company in the neai
future. —Prospect.

Last Sunday afcernoon a couple of
Indians, John Powell and Oscar
Sprian, known as Oscar Miller, got
into a row at the China vegetable gar
den, during the progress of which
Sprian was cut in tho back with a
knife. Both Indiana had evidently
been drinking. The knife wound was
superficial, the blade having struck a
rib under the right shoulder blade,
inflicting an incised wound a little
•ess than thiee-tourths of an inch
long. The Indian, John Powell, who
is charged with doing the cutting, had
a jug partly tilled with beer, which it
is claimed the old Chinaman, Lock
i'ai, bought for him at the brewery.
Constable Kelly was at once uoMHed
and went to the scene of the row, but
when he got there the tight was over.
He placed John Powell under arrest
and took him to the calaboose. Powell
had his preliminary hearing before
Justice McCauley Tuesday, and was
bound over to answer before the su
perior court, under §1000 bonds. Not
tieiug able to give bonds, constable
Kelly took him to the county jail

Last of Indians.
When on March 4, 1900, the tribal
organization of the Cherokees, Clioo
taws, Creeks, Cbickasaws and Semia
oles is dissolved, and their members
diffused in the mass of the country's
citizenship, the final chapter in the
Indian's annals as a distinct race will
have been written, says C. M. Harvey,
in Atlantic Monthly. These are very
far from comprising all the red men
in the country. They number a little
over 86,000, while the total Indian
population of tin: United States, ex
clusive of Alaska, is about 270,000.
They do not even include the entire
Indian inhabitants ot their own lo
cality, the Indian Territory, in the
territory's noitheast corner there are
fragments of the Peonas, Shawnees,
Quapaws, Wyandottes, Seneoas, Mo
docs and Ottawas, numbering in nil
about 1500.
Numerically, however, the five civ
ilized tribes are more important than
any other aggregation nf red men.
They are of immeasurably greater
consequence socially than all the rest
of the Indians in the United States
put together. The middle term of the
dsignation given to them here means
just what it says. They are civilized
Indians. In each tribe for itself, for
two generations, they have been con
ducting their own affairs in their own
way. They have their own legisla
tures, oxeoutives and courts. Also
thoir own churches and school system.
Subject to the requirement that they
must keep within the limitations of
the United States and must recognize
the United States government's para
mount authority, they have been su
preme in their own domain.
This ascendancy ends with the dis
solution of the tribal governments on
March 4, 1906. United States laws will
then be immediately extended over
the Indian territory, the terms Semi
uole, Cherokee, Choctaw and the rest
of them v/ill vanish, and their bearers
will gain the same privileges and be
subject to the same responsibilities as
their white neighbors in Oklahoma
and the rest df the territories. Very
soon after that date they will probab
ly, jointly with Oklahoma, eutor on
the larger privileges and penalties of
statehood.

A Hundred Years to Come.
Oh, where will be the birds that sing
A hundred years to come?
The flowers that now in beauty spring
A hundred years to come?
The rosy lip, the lofty brow,
The heart that beats so gayly now?
Oh, where will be Love's beaming eye.
Joy's pleasant smile and Sorrow's sigh
A hundred years to come.
Who'll press for good this crowded
street
A hundred years to come?
Who'll tread yon church with willing
teet
A hundred years to come?
Pale, trembling age and fiery youth
And chilhood with its brow of truth.
The ricn and poor, on land and sea—
Where will the mighty millions be
A hundred years to come?
We all within our graves shall sleep
A hundred years to come.
No living soul for us shall weep
A hundred years to come.
But other men our land will till,
And others then our streots shall fill,
While other birds shall sing us gay,
As bright the sunshine as today,
A hundred years to come.
—William Goldsmith Brown.
Letters of Long Ago.
"Antiquarians are now engaged in
the fascinating task of searching the
waste paper of antiquity— that ot
Greece and Rome- and muoh new light
is being shed uoon the every day life
of those wonderful people," said Dr.
Moses Emanuel Cassanowitz of the
Smithsonian institution to a New York
Sun correspondent.
"We find," he continued, "Ircm
the relics thus garnered from rubbish
that human nature was then very
much what it is at present. "Here,
for instance, is a letter written by a
boy in the country, in Egypt, to his
father, contemplating a trip to Alex
andria, eighteen centuries ago. It is
on papyrus but as you see, when new
muoh resembled the modern sheet of
note paper. It reads thus, in very
good Greek.
" Theon, to His Father, Theon,
Greeting— You have done a tine thing
not to take me with you to the city.
If you won't take me with you to
Alexandria 1 won't write a letter or.
speak to you or say good by to you,
and if you go to Alexandria 1 won't
take your hand nor ever greet you
again. That is what will happen . if
you won't take me. Mother said to
Arcbelaus: "It quite upset him to
be left behind" It was nioe of you
to send me presents . . on the 12th,
the day yon sailed. Send me a lyre,
please. If you don't, I won't eat, 1
won't drink. There, now! Good
by."
"It is just beginning to be recog
nized that these sources ot informa
tion on the life ot the ancients are
full of human interest, to say nothing
of their value in the eye of the anti
quarian. It is only recently that ex
plorers have undertaken to sift the
rubbish heap of antiquity tor those
memorials contained in letters, busi
ness papers, official documents, etc.,
eloquent as telling what manner ot
people they emanated from and their
social and political environment.
"The Egyptian exploration fund has
been productive of much that has been
done in that direction, and the lower
valley of the Nile has yielded a vast
wealth of papyri, written in all pos
sible languages and separated in time
by thousands of years. Unlike the
literary find of previous exploiations,
such as that undertaken, for instance,
in the valleys of Mesopotamia, these
papyri do not represent the remains
of royal and patrician libraries or
temple archives. They are the fugitive
remains that have survived from the
discarded rubbish ot long vanished
centuries old, minute books and led
gers from public and private offices,
second-hand and worn-out books.
" These finds are of unquestioned
value to the historian of the future.
No district has yet yielded so plenti
ful a supply ot documents of this dis
cription as the Fayum, situated west
ot the Nile and south-west of Cairo,
aud in ancient times containing the
famous Lake Moeris and the Laby
rinth.
"The great mass ot these papyri is
of a nou -literary character, and their
contents of the most varied descrip
tion — love letters, leases aud loans,
bills and discbarges, marriage con
tracts and divorces, proclamations and
notices of penalties, minute? of law
proceedings, assessments and receipts,
beside school exercises, magical tests,
charms aud horoscopes, day books,
etc.
"Tho3e in Greek, numbering many
thousands, cover a period of about a
thousand years. The oldest go bock
to the time of the early Ptolemies or
to the third century B. C. while
others are of tbe Byzantine era. A
lesser source of supply has been found
in the padding and wrapping of mum
mies for which inscribed papyri were
often used especially in the Fayum.

BKYAN STICKS TO SILVER.
Bryan is making a vain attempt to
dodge silver. In the latest issue of
his Commoner the leading editorial
bears the ominous title of "In the
Spirit of 1896." Several things are in
the editorial which also call up un
pleasant associations for his party.
"Democrats have no disposition to
forget the Chicago paltform," it says,
" for that platform represented in
1896, even as it docs to-day, the real
conservatism of the country. Owing
to tbe unprecedented production of
gold, the money question is not and
will not be discussed in detail, as it
was in the Chicago platform, but the
underlying principle of tiimetallism,
the quantitative theory, has been
amply vindicated, and is now general
ly recognized."
This talk about "the spirit of 1896"
will check that rush of gold demo
crats over to Bryan's 3ide. His devo-
tion to what he calls "the underlying
principles oi bimetallism" shows that
he has recanted nothing. He stands
just where he stood in 1896, except
that be intimates that for the moment
it will uot be expedient to make any
open declaration in favor of throwing
the minto -wide open to tbe coinage of
silver at the 16-to-l ratio. He takes
back nothing ot what he said in favor
of the debased dollar ten years ago or
six years ago. He merely concedes
that the republican party and tbe gold
miners have taken the money issue
out of politics fur tbe time.
But the rise in silver is likely to
give Bryan and bis friends courage to
renew their battle for 16-to-l. Silver
has recently averaged 66 cents an
ounce. It has gone up 10 cents an
ounce in a few months. The Bland
coin is no longer a 45-cent dollar.
It is now a 51-cent dollar. Silver to
day is about where it was ten years
ago when Bryan began his wai in fav
or ot throwing open the mints to it at
the 16-to 1 ratio, without waiting for
tbe aid or consent of any other na
tion. The Bland-Bryan coin may be
a 52-cent or a 55-cent dollar by 1908.
If the present rise is maintained to
that time there will be a strong pres
sure on Bryan's party to renew its old
warfare in favor of silver free coinage,
in principle Bryan is, as he show? in
his paper, a free silverite. Despite
bis* dodging, his nomination in 1908,
if it takes place, will put the silver
issue at the front, and make the third
battle more disastrous for Bryan and
bis dupes than was the second battle
or the first. — Globe-Democrat.

Mr Wood a few years ago iiad a short
but meteoric career in this county.
He practiced law at Angels, and forced
himself upon the republican conven

in the demoralization of tbe party
which took place that year. Soon
after his defeat he left Angels, and

The Greatest Gem
Mine in the World.
The sapphire workings at Yogo
Gulch, Montana, are being gradually
developed into a great and permanent
mining industry, says George F. Kunz
in a forthcoming report on precious
stones, published by tbe United States
Geological Survey. Taken as a
whole, the Yogo dike is perhaps tbe
greatest mine in the world. It is
about four miles long on the surface,
and being a true igneous dike, de
scends to an indefinite depth. It is
estimated that tbe entire content of
workable sapphire-bearing rock would
approximate 10.000,000 cubic yards.
A mining plant is now being erected
here which will quadruple tho pre
vious output and make Montana
sapphire mining a very important
factor in American gem production.
The stones obtained are not of large
size. They range from "culls." used
for watch jewels and other mechanical
purposes, to gems aver&ging, when
cut, from half a carat to two or three
carats aud rarely up to five or six.
As gems they are brilliant, tree from
flaws and of good color, ranging from
light shades to the rich, deep blue
of oriental sapphires. Ihe Y'ogo
crystals have an advantage for
mechanical uses over East Indian
stones in their form, which is laigely
short prismatic or rhombohedral with
flat basal terminations, and hence
they need much less cutting for such
purposes as watch jewels. Tbe gems
are sent to Amsterdam tor cutting,
and yield rrom two-fifths to one-half
that weight of finished stones.T THE AMIDOR LEDGER

O Official Paper of Amador co.
F FRIDAY JULY (i, 1906
AFTER STATE FUNDS.
In the report of the board ot super
visors published elsewhere, will be
seen one items tending to explain the
reason of the high tax rate in this
county. The supervisors at the meet
ing this week were called upon to act
upon applications for the support ot
orphans and half orphans, under a
state law passed several years ago,
but not enforced in this county until
the last few years. Tuo money
allowed tor the support of these or
phan children, comes from tho state
treasury, and this fact really con
stitutes the weakness. The applica
tions are acted upon by the super
visors of the respective counties, and
the allowances are paid out of the
county treasuries, but the bills are
finally sent in to the state authorities,
and thereby the counties are ieim
bursed tor the sums so paid out.
Under this insidious arrangement,
the argument is used with effect, in
considering the application for main
tenance, "ihe money does not come
from the people of Amador county
in particular, but from the state at
.large." Aud the managers of the
counties are imbued in a great
measure with the spirit that pervades
the ordinary state legislator, namely:
"Get all you can out of the state
treasury for the benelit of your local
ity. " On this proposition hangs the
reputation of the representative. If
be gets his hands into the states
strong box very slightly—no matter
how conscientiously — he is estimated
as a poor stick. On the other hand, if
be dives deep into the state funds,
and has money galore scattered over
his district, he is all right— just the
kind of a man to send to the law
making body. "(Jet appropriations"
is the popular cry; "don't haggle
about methods or actual needs get
money for your district." So it is
more or less with subordinate bodies
clothed with the power to appropriate
money trom the state treasury. They
do not pause to reflect, that with every
county in the state actuated by the
same spirit, the ultimate outcome is
precisely the same as if every county
was called upon to support its own
orphans and halt orphans out of ils
own treasury. Amador county at
its last meeting passed claims for this
purpose aggregating Sl7B per month
or 52130 per year. This money comes
from the taxpayers of this county
eventually. It may take a round
about course, but all the same the
citizens ot Amador have to foot the
bills eventually, and all other bills
based upon similar foolishly-framed
laws. We have to pay our proportion
for the support of these wards
throughout the state; and in the
final outcome, we have to pay fully
as much, it not 'more, than it' we
stood upon our own bottom, and sup
ported these children by a direct
drain upon our local treasury. There
is this vital difference. Ji the super
visors were passing such claims,
knowing them to be a purely local
charge, they would be apt to look
into the merits of each application
more thoroughly than they now do
under the existing system. There
would be no "doing politics" at the
expense of the state treasury about it.

AN ACQUIRED SIGHT.
A New York negro has established
in the courts his right to wear the
emblems of secret orders to which he
does not belong. The Elks disputed
his right to sport their insignia. In
some quarters his victory seems to be
taken as promoting the rights of black
men. Not to our notion. Why does
any self-respecting, honest man,
white or black, want to wear the
e:ublems of orders to which he does
not belong? Ho is plainly nailiug
under false colors, trying to deceive
peole as to his social status. He muy
have a legal right to be a fraud and
a pretender, but his moral right will
have to be established by a higher
tribunal than a New York court ot
justice.— Oakland Tribune.

Assessment Figures of County.
Tho following table complied trom
the assessor's hooks, shows the assess
ed value ot property by townships, in
Amador county for the years 1005 and
11)00.
11)05 100G
Township 1 - §1,722,798 $1,905,553
Township 2 - 1,074,060 1,085,225
Township 3 - 734,09(5 550,130
Township! - 1,136,620 1,139,822.
Township 5 - (556,392 075,764
50, 524, 572 50, 35(5, 800
Gain 31,228
These Ugures are of course subject
to change by the county board of
equalization; although it is not pro
bable that any matei lal changes will
be made. The assessment of railroad
property is yet to be added, which
will not bo less than 8120,000. As
they stand, it is gratifying to Und
that every section of the county has
increased iv taxable property, with
the exception of township three,
where apparently a tremendous slump
h^s occurred, the loss being $184,260,
or 25 per cent of total valuation.
This falling off, however, is merely
in figures, not in actual value. It is
accounted tor by the fact that a
mortgage on some mining property in
that township was included in the
assessment at its full face value of
5200.000. It was an unreal value, and
the obligation has since been can
celled, thereby reducing the assess
ment roll to that extent. The value
was never there, so that has been no
decline, but simply a return to
uormal and actual, instead of fic
titious values.
Making due allowance for this over
valuation, every township shows a
gain, in most cases the increase is
small. The biggest increase is shown
in township one, which has added
8184,2(50 to the figures of 1905. This
is a good showing. Township tour
makes a^ain of 53, 202, notwithstand
ing the depression in mining circles
incident to the shutdown of the
Wildmsß Mahoney for a greater part
ot the year. Township five rolls up
nearly 520.000 more than last' year,
and township two a trifle over $10,000.
While therefore the net gain, from
the figures presented is only 931,228,
the gain iv revenue will be on an
assessment roll of more than $200,00U
in excess of last, year, which means
about 54,000 more than was collected
in 1905 from direct property tax.
Demagogic Appeals.
Wiltord Dennis, of Sutter Creek,
who is an independent aspirant for
the olb'ce of assessor, has formulated
a sort of platform of principles, or
rather a declaration ot policy, upon
which he appeals for the support ot
the voters. Here is the gist of his
published platform:
The present tax list of Amador
county amounts to a trifle over five
million dollars. If 1 am elected 1
will immediately proceed to assess
the wealthy mining corporations
for practically what they are worth
in the open market, but in no event
would 1 assess them for less than live
million dollars. This will double the
amount of taxable property inAmador
county, and as we do not need any
moie money to ruu the county govern
ment than we have used in preceding
years, the buard of supervisor will be
able to give a one dollar rate per hun
dred, and in this way cut the taxes of
the farmer, small merchant, property
holders and working men practically
in halt.
It is hardly possible to take such a
declaration seriously. It is douLtless
the wildest piogram ever laid down
by a local aspirant. We do not quote
it because ot any danger ot the voters
grasping at such a bait, in the hope
of relief from taxpaying. A few
voters who like dreamland as a place
of abode, may imagine there is some
thing worthy of consideration in it.
but these are few and far between,
and are difficult to reach with sound
argument. But the object aimed at
is plain. Xhe mine owners are few in
number, as compared with the voters
generally. Now by proposing to
cinch the few min6 owners for the
benefit ot all other taxpayers, the
masses will be tickled into voting for
the new departure. We do not deem
the program deserving of discussion.
Property owners are not to be caught
with such claptrap utterances, know
ing that the plan is utterly impractic
able and thoroughly disnDnest.
Furthermore the conclusion reached —
the actual benefit to the taxpayers
generally by the doubliug-up process
against the mining industry— is fai
| fetched and a delusion. It is a fatal
error from a governmental standpoint
to imagine that a boosting of the
: assessment roll means a correspond
j ing reduction in the tax rate. The
j history of Amador county for the
past decade is a refutation of such
an idea. As a matter of fact, we
have nearly doubled up on our assess
ment roll, as compared with twenty
years ago, and the tax rate is much
higher today than it was then.
Arbitral ily stuffing the assessment
roll affords no remedy; it invariably
tails of its object. We shall never

get relief until the opposite end of

vagauce, and so remodel the reveuue

BELLS IN CHURCHES.
FIRST USED BY PAULINUS, BISHOP
OF NOLA, ABOUT 400.
T The Early Brltixh Christians Used
W Wooden Unities to Call the People
T Together For Worship — Bolls and
T Thunder and Lightning.
C Church bells are of ancient origin.
T The ancients had bells for both sacred
f find profane purposes. Strabo says
t that market time was announced by
t their sound and Pliny that the tomb
o of an ancient king of Tuscany was
h hung round with bells. The hour of
b bathing was made known in ancient
R Rome by the sound of a bell. The
n night watchman carried one, and it
s served to call up the servants in great
h houses. Sheep had them tied about
t their necks to frighten away wolves,
o or, rather, by way of amulet.
Paulinos, bishop of Nola, is general
ly considered the first person who in
troduced bells into ecclesiastical serv
ice about the year 400. Historians say
that in CIO the bishop of Orleans, being
at Seno, then in a state of siege, fright
ened away the besieging army by ring
ing St. Stephen's church bells, which is
a clear proof that they were not at that
time generally known in France. The
first large bells are mentioned by
Bede in the year 6SO. Before that pe
riod the early British Christians made
use of wooden rattles to call the con
gregation of the faithful together.
Hand bells probably first appeared at
religious processions and were after
ward used by the seculars. The small
bells were not always held in the
hand. They were sometimes suspend
ed upon a stake and struck with ham
mers.
The arrival of kings and great per
sonages was anciently greeted by ring
ing the church bells. luguiohus, abbot
of Croyland, who died about 1109,
speaks of them as being well known In
his time and says that "the first abbot
of Croyland gave six bells to that mon
astery—that is to say, two great ones,
which he named Bartholomew and Bel
adine; two of a medium size, called
Turketulium and Bettriue; two small
ones, denominated Pega and Bega. He
also caused the great bell to be made
called Gudla, which was tuned to the
other bell and produced an admirable
harmony not to be equaled in Eng
land."
The bells used in the monasteries
were sometimes rung with ropes hav
ing brass or silver rings at the ends
for the hand. They were anciently
rung by the priests themselves, after
ward by the servants and sometimes
by those incapable of other duties, as
persons who were blind.
The doctrine of the Church of Rome
concerning bells is that they have mer
it and pray God for the living and the
dead; second, that they produce devo
tion in the hearts of the faithful. The
dislike of evil spirits to bells is well
expressed by Wynken de Worde in the
"Golden Legend." The passing bell was
anciently rung for two good purposes,
one to bespeak the prayers of all good
Christian people for a soul just depart
ing and the other to drive away the
evil spirits who stood Bt the foot of the
bed or about the house. Such was the
general opinion respecting the efficacy
of bells before the reformation, but
since that period "it has been the usual
course in the Church of England that
when any sick person lay dying a
bell should toll to give notice to the
neighbors that they might pray for the
dying party, which was commonly
called a passing bell, because the sick
person Tvas passing hence to another
world, and when his breath was ex
pired the bell rung out that the neigh
bors might cease their prayers, for that
the party was dead." It is now only
tolled after death.
The saint's bell was not so called
from the name of the sain* that was
inscribed on It or of Uie church to
which it belonged, but because it was
always rung out when the priest came
to that part of the service, "Sanctus,
Sanctus, Sauctus, Domine t>eus Sab
baoth," purposely that these persons
who could not come to c-t vch might
know in what a solemn olfit'c the con
gregation were at that instant engag
ed and go, even in their absence, bo
once, at least, moved to lift up their
hearts to him who made them. Bells
at one time were thought an effectual
charm against lightning. The frequent
firing of abbey churches by lightning
confuted the proud motto commonly
written on their bells in the steeples,
wherein each entitled itself to a six
fold efficacy — viz:
Men's death I tell by doleful knell;
JL-ightning and thunder I break asunder;
On Sabbath all to church I call;
The sleepy head I raise from bed;
The winds so fierce I dost disperse;
Men's cruel rage I do assuage.
It has anciently been reported, ob
served Lord Bacon, and is still re
ceived that extreme applause and
shouting of people assembled In multi
tudes have so rarefied and broken the
air that birds flying over have fallen
down, the air not being able to sup
port them, and It is believed by some
that great ringing of bells in popu
lous cities has chased away thunder
and also dissipated pestilent air.— New

INCENDIARY TALK.
Every reader ot this paper, and
every friend, neighbor and sbopmate
whom he can influence, should at once
write a letter to Judge Frank i J .
Smith, of Caldwell, Idaho, aud re
quest that he release on bail comrades
Moyer, Haywood aud Pettibone .
Iv addition to this, take it up iv
your union and socialist local, and
pass resolutions to the same effect,
aud forward them to Judgo Smith.
The above is taken trom the last
issue of the Appeal to Reason, tho or
gan of the Western Federation and
socialists, published at Uirard, Kan
sas. A more brazen attempt to intimi
date the judicinry has rarely come
under our notice. If this does not
come within the law of contempt of
court it is hard to tell what does. It
is plauly aimed to overawe the judge
in the discharge of his duty by the
sheer weight of numbers. Such are
the ideas of governmental reform held
by the socialists. Moyer aud his com
rades are held for murder, an offense
of an uubailable kind.
Here is another excerpt trom the
same source concerning the proceed
ings of the receut annual convention
of the Western Federation.
"lioldly and fearlessly, like the
brave, manly men they are, the dele
gates to the miners' convention threw
craven conservatism to the winds and
unsheathed their swords in mortal
combat with plutocracy for the social
and economic rights ot those who
toil. They have decreed that there
shall be no baltiug, no compromise,
and no retreat iv the struggle. It is
a fight between the working class and
the capitalist class. Every delegate
to the convention pledged himself to
make it a finish fight until one or the
other of the contending forces shall
stand untrammelled and supreme.
The weapons will be agitation, organ
ization, education, ballots, and if
necessary, bullets."
This means that armed rebellion
will be the ultimate appeal in carry
ing out their program, if pencefui
methods fail of success. And this
inciting to rebellion is tolerated
under our laws. Furthermore, the
United States mails are resorted to
and used in this propaganda to under
mine the existing order of things.

TUF AMADOR LEDfiEK: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, JULY G, 1906.
The Fourth in Jackson.
Notwithstanding that the county
seat inado no elfort to publicly cele
brato the fourth, giving way in this
respect to other towns in the county,
au impromptu rrogram of small
attractions, was arranged in the after
nocu. A few citizens went round
and raised between 830 and 810 among
the business houses to furnish prizes
for racing contests and fireworks.
Tho fireworks part ot it was not
countenanced by many, as the city
ordinances prohibiting explosives of
any kind iv the street had only just
gone into effect. It was generally
voted a wise and beneficial provision;
and one tbat should be strictly en
forced; but unfortunately it was not,
to the serious weakening in tbe
popular mind ot the law enforcing
authorities. It tbe ordinance was
not intended for all times and all
persons, it should not have been
passed, on the contrary, if so intend
ed, all should be made to comply
with it on fourth of July or any other
time.
The amusements commenced about
three o'clock in the afternoon, and
consisted ot as great a variety of lac
mg contests as is usually given at a
regular celebration, and certainly
furnished as much amusement to the
crowd. While many of our citizens
departed for other points— many to
Plymouth, and not a few to lone,
there were enough left at home to
furnish a big crowd to witness the
amusements.
The winners of the various contests
were as follows :
Donkey race, won by Johnny
Ferenzi, S3.
Potato race— Lewis Love, 81.50;
second price, 50c, Leon Schwartz.
Girls' rac«, won by Violet Love, SI.
Boxing match between John Dela
hide and Dan Dragolovioh, called a
draw, 75c each.
Men's foot race— P. L. Cassinelli
and C. Eustis entered. Eustis stum
bled at a critical point and thereby
lost ther race and tbe prize.
Not satisfied with the outcome the
friends of Eustis backed him for a
match with Cassinelli tor ten dollars
aside. This event created much
interest, and partisans backed their
favorite with considerable money iv
side bets. Eustis won.
Boxing match between Xat Simcich
and Arthur Andrews, draw, 75c each.
Drilling contest for boys, won by
John Delabide and Virgilo Boro.
Drilling contest tor men, won by
Mode Fortuer and Daiporta.
Bicycle race— First price 82, Arthur
Parker; second prize 50c, Arthur
Andrews.
Several private matches were arrang
.d, and furnished a fund of enjoy
ment, for the crowd. P. L. Cassinolli
aud Frank Valvo bet 510 each on their
sprinting qualities. They proceeded
to decide the issue, and Valvo won.
Cassiuelii was not yet satisfied, and
made another match with the victor
for a like amount. This time Cassi
uelii won. They concluded to let
the question of superiority stay right
there — each victor and vanquished.
Another footrace was gotten up
between K. 1. Kerr aud Frank Burgin
for SlO, a side, Kerr won by a slender
margin.
A collection was taken up amount
ing to 85, and a lot of firecrackers
purchased and suspended from a
string from the Globe hotel porch
across the street, a la Chinese fash
ion, aud lighted. The din reminded
one of the old-fashioned celebrations
of Chinese Aew Year. After this
breaking down of safeguards the
youngsteis thought they had an equal
right to set off fireworks, and they
did so without hindrance for several
hours, roniau caudles, bombs, sky
rockets.
A drill by the members of Uniform
Kank K. ot P. took place on Main
street in the evening, which was
witnesed by hundreds who lined the
str»et ou either side. This was
followed by a grand ball in tbe even
ing iv Love's hail, under (he auspices
ot the same organization. This drew
an immense crowd. In spite ot the
fervid weather, the hall was packed
to overflowing. Dancing was kept up
till near daylight, aud al! who
participated unite in voting it a
pleasurable affair.

are expected to meet in their respec
tive districts next Saturday for the
purpose of organization for the ensu
ing school year. The school year com
mences on the first ot July. At the
first meeting the trustees are required
to organize by the election of a clerk.
It is the only meeting that gives them
the opportunity; as, if they tail to
meet or neglect to select a clerk, the

superintendent. It is also customary
for the teachers ot tho ensuing school
year to be selected at the July meet
iDg. This is not compulsory. They

quent meeting. It is probable, how
ever, that most of the teachers will be
appointed at the coming meeting.

MINING NOTES.
Wildman— A clean-up of the teat
inn on ore from this mine was made
a few days ago. According to reports
wuicb nave leaked out the yield was
very satisfactory, leaving a good
margin of profit over all workiug
expenses. This outcome ought to
materially aid in the disposal of the
mine, or at least in getting the pro
perty started on a permanent basis.
Gold lop— The clean-up of this
gravel claim at Pine Urove is nearly
finished. It bids fair to be sufficient
to pay all outstanding claims at least.
bunker Hill— The cleau-up at this
mill fell a little behind the unusually
good yield of the previous month,
still it was highly satisfactory,
amounting, we are informed, to
between 312,000 and 813,000 for the 20
stamps. Tho pressing need of the
company is a new hoist of greater
capacity, and the directors are taking
preparatory steps to that end. The
present hoist has answered for the
depth of 1500 feet, to which the mine
has been prospected, but to explore
the property to greater depth will
involve a more powerful hoist.
Obstruction Removed.
i'he city ordinance relating to
obstructions ou the sidewalks went
into effect Monday morning. On that
morning there was not a chair to be
seen on either side ot Main street,
nor any goods obstructing the foot
way. Steps were at once taken to
remove the bootblack stands, hereto
fore standing on the edge of the
street. These have also disappeared,
either taken inside, or abolished
entirely. Wnore the enforcement of
this ordinance will work a hardship
is in keeping everbyody within doors
or standing in front of his premises.
He cannot be seated in a chair on the
sidewalk, as has heretofore been the
custom. Aud this applies not only
to Main sheet, but to ail other
streets. In the hot summer it is next
to impossible to remain indoor." all
the time. And yet for business
olaces this is made imperative under
the ordinance. There can be no
lounching about in chairs on the side
walks. Citizeus will have to get
accustomed to the new order of
things.

wistful little face ami the bright Silver
collar she wore quite well, but she was
never to be seen by daylight. It was
only on tbe sixth evening, half starveil
and weak with waiting, that she al
lowed herself to be captured aud taken
to tbe dogs' home at Battersen, where
she was eventually claimed by her
owner.— St. James' Gazette.

Restoring Forest Reserve Land.
For some days the Land Office in
Sacramento has been besieged by let
ters asking just when and where the
land in the temporary forest reserve
iv the Sacramento district was to be
opened up for settlement.
Registrar Armstrong and receiver
Newcum said today that they had no
definite knowledge as to the actual
sections, townships aud ranges to be
restored, and that the order making
tho restoration had not yet been re
ceived from Washington and pro
bably will not be for some weeks to
come.
In 1902 the secretary of the interior
withdrew large areas of the public do
main in California from settlement,
entry, sale or other disposal under the
public land laws pending the determi
nation of the question of the advisa
bility of including those lands within
a forest reserve. The lands are main
ly in the high Sieira range and em
brace the headwaters of the many
watersheds which form the streams
aud riveis of our state.
As soon aa practicable after this
temporary withdrawal. Gifford Pin
chot, forester of the forest service of
the agricultural department, put
crews of his most capable assistants at
work on the necessary investigations,
and within a very short time the re
port and recommendations of tbe
forest service were in the bands of
the secretary of the interior. Those
who reported on the subject were in
structed to recommend the inclusion
within forest reserves of only those
portions of the withdrawn area which,
when included within n permanent,
forest reserve, would meet all the
requirements of re forestation con
servation of water and increased graz
ing capacity.
The people of the state did not take
kindly to the establishment of new
forest reserves, and the departments
at Washington were besieged with
petitions asking that the lands with
drawn be restored to entry. To all of
these thoy gave no serious heed and
on their recommendation, the presi
dent by hia proclamations has estab
lished the following reserves:
Santa Barbara, Dec. 22, 1903; War
ner Mountain, Nov. 29, 1904; Modoc,
Nuv. 29, 1904; Plumas/Mareh 27, 1905;
Trinity, April 26, 1905; Klamath, May
6, 1905; Lassen Peak, June 2, 1905;
Diamond Mountain, July 14, 1905;
Sierra, July 25, 1905; Shasta, Oct. 3,
1905; Tahoe (additional), Oct. 3,
1905; Yuba, Nov. 11, 1905.
The establishment of the above
mentioned forest reserves loft without
the boundaries thereof many thou
sands of acres of the lands originally
temporarily withdrawn and tho people
are now more than anxious to have
that restored to eutry which it is
settled will not be needed tor any
permanent reserve.
Representative Giliett, realizing the
importance of this restoration to
many of his constituents, took up
the matter with the forest service of
the agricultural department and with
the interior department, and accord
ing to recent published advices from
Washington, they are now preparing
the maps and orders necessary so that
the restoration ot the lands in the
temporary reserves adjacent to that
which has been made permanent may
be accomplished in the near future.
The lands to be restored upon the
request of representative Gillett are
in Mariposa, Tuolumne, Amador, El
Dorado, Placer and Nevada counties.
In El Dorado the restoration is to be
north of the line between townships
10 and 11 north. Restoration of land
south of this line in El Dorado
county will in all probability not be
made until a permanent reserve js
created connecting the Tahoe with
the Stanislaus reserve. The matter
of the restoration of the temporarily
withdrawn lands in Sierra, Yuba,
Butte and Tehama counties will be
taken ud at a later date. —Sacramento

Art by «h<- Ton.
An American city once asked Mac-
Monnles, the sculptor, to enter a design
for army aud navy groups for a sol
diers' aud sailors' monument, He de
clined to compete. Then the commis
sion was tendered to him outright. He
submitted sketches of his idea for the
groups. The committee In charge ol
the monument wrote him, asking,
"How many tons of granite do you in
tend to use in the base?" Hfs reply
was: "If you are in the business of
buying granite you may use as lnucli
as you want, one ton or 100,000 tons.
1 am an artist, and I never yet heard
of art being bought by the pound."
The question was dropped until the
contract for the commission was
drawn. When Mr. MacMonnles re
ceived it he discovered in it a clause
providing that in case the bronzes were
ever thrown down from their base, by
any cause whatever, and any person
or property should be injured, he and
his heirs forever should be liable foi
the damage sustained. He returned
the contract without comment, uusign
cd. When the committee wrote him,
asking the reason, his brief reply was.
"Your lawyers are too sharp." — World's
Work.
The Itnliugr Passion Strong In Death,
The ruling passion of Edward I. ol
England was undoubtedly the pursuit
of his ideal of uniting all the Britist
islands under one rule. His great ob
staclc was Scotland, and the couquesl
of Scotland, therefore, became a pas
sion with him. Stronger than years, II
sent him to the head of the army when
he was fit only for a sick bed, anil
when he was at last compelled to
yield he sought to make this passion
spur on his son by ordering that tbc
flesh should bo boiled from his bone.
and that his skeleton should be car
ried at the head of the army and re
main uuburied till Scotland was con
quered.
This is the most conspicuous instance
of "the ruling passion strong in death"
on record, though many others would
be worthy of quotation. William Pitt's
patriotism endured to his last gasp and
inspired his last utterance, as did Nel
son's lifelong determination to secure
the command of the sea. while Napo
leon's last dream was one of battle.
Pennant and I'ifCx.
A clever smuggling trick has beeu
played on a customs officer on the
Uusso-German frontier. Au innocent
looking peasant reported to the officer
a plot for getting a large number ol
pigs across tho frontier. The method,
he said, would be to drive across at in
tervals of half an hour, 3. G, 12 and 200
pigs, the smugglers arguing that if the
first three lots could be sent over there
would be no trouble with the 200.
The officer was naturally on the alert.
In accordance with tlie peasant's state
ment three pigs were driven over, then
six, followed by twelve. All were al
lowed to pass, and preparations were
made to receive the 200. But no niore
pigs appeared, aud tlio twenty-one ani
mals admitted had in tho meantime
been lodged In safety.— Berlin Cor.

Rudimentary Hind Limbs.
Snakes are not the ouly animals
which exhibit the possession of rudi
mentary hind limbs. In the whale
tribe there is no evidence externally of
hind limbs. The fore limbs In them
are converted into the "flippers," or
MWlimniiig paddles. Yet when the skel
eton Is examined traces of a haunch
aud attached rudimentary thigh bones
are found. There is developed in cer
tain kinds of wllales a bony piece rep
resenting the haunch. The thigh bone
Is distinct, but there is a mere rudi
ment attached to it, representing the
shin bone or tibia of other auimals.
Ancient licmcil !•■- For Hiccoughs.

The "Giant" Bell.
Russia is famed for the manufacture

NO MAN IS STRONGER THAN
HIS STOMACH.
Lot tim greatest athlete have dyspepsia
and his muscle* would soon fail. Physi-
cal strength i.; derived from food. if a
man has insufficient food ho lonea strength.
If be has no food ho dies. Food is con-
verted into nutrition through the stom-
ach and bowels. It depends on the
strength of the stomach to what extent
food eaten is digested and assimilated.
People can dio of starvation who have
abundant food to eat. when the stomach
and its associate organs of digestion and
nutrition do not perform their duty.
Thus the. stomach is really the vital or-
gan of the body. If the stomach is"weak"
the body will be weak also, because it Is
upon tho stomach the body relies for its
strength. And as the body, considered as
a whole, is made up of it's several mem-
bers and organs, so the weakness of tho
body as a consequence of "weak" stom-
ach will be distributed among the or-
gans which compose the body. If the
body is weak because it is ill-nourished
that physical weakness will be found in
all tlie organs heart, liver, kidneys, etc.
The liver will be torpid and inactive,
giving rise to biliousness, loss of appetite,
weak nerves, feeble or irregular action of
heart, palpitation, dizziness, headache,
backache and kindred disturbances and
weaknesses.
Mr. Louis Pare, of Quebec, writes: "For
rears after my health began to fail, my head
grew dizzy, eyes pained me, and my stomach
was sore all tho lime, while everything I
would eat would seem to lie heavy like lead
on my stomach, "flic doctors claimed that
It was sympathetic trouble due to dyspepsia,
and prescribed for me. and although I took
their powders regularly yet l"felt no better.
My wire advised mo to try Dr. Pierco's Golden
Medical Discovery— stop taking the doc-
tor's medicine. She bought me a bottle, and
we soon found thai I began to improve, to I
kept up the treatment. I took on flesh, my
stomach became normal, the digestive
worked perfectly and I soon it-can to look
like a different person. I can never cease to
be grateful for what your medicine has done
for me and I certainly five it highest praise."

*Only Me;"
There may be a world of pathos and
even of rebuke In a very few words,
nud so the rather thoughtless wife of
a contributor of ours discovered recent
ly. She has two sweet little children,
both girls, and, almost without know-
Ing it, she made a pet and favorite
of the younger and prettier child.
"Sweet," as she called her, had every
care and attention lavished upon her,
and good natured neglect was more or
less the portion of the elder.
The mother was sitting in her bed
room quietly reading recently when the
soft patter of tiny feet soaaded on the
stairs.
"Is that you, Sweet?" she called.
"No, mamma," was the sad reply;
"it isn't Sweet— it's only me!"
That pathetic little "Only me!" haunt
ed the wife of our contributor for long
er than she would have cared to admit,
but a change has since marked her
treatment of her eldest born.— London
Tit-Bits.
Toughness of the Ant.
Ants are really very long lived, con
slderlng- their minuteness. , Janet had
two queens under observation for ten
years, and one of Sir John Lubbock's
ant pets lived into her fifteenth year.
Ants are very tenacious of life after
severe injury. Following loss of the
entire abdomen, they sometimes live
two weeks, and in one case a headless
ant, carefully decapitated by aseptic
surgery, lived for forty-one days. A
carpenter ant after being submerged
eight days in distilled water came to
life upon being dried, so that ants are
practically proof against drowning.
They can live for long periods without
food. In one case the fast lasted near
ly nine months before the ant starved
to death.— Scientific American.
Dice From Billiard Balls.
"What" becomes of the wornout bil
liard balls 7" said an idler In a billiard
room.
"Well," the man at the desk replied,
"when a ball is only a little off it is
sent to the factory to be trued up. We
get our balls trued up until they be
come too small for use. Then we sell
them at so much per ounce.
"After their sale they are carved into
various small trinkets, but in the main
they are made into dice. Of the forty
or fifty balls rolling and clicking busi
ly here this evening it Is safe to say
that 90 per cent of them a few years
hence will be working just as hard in
the form of dice."
CnriuuN Astronomical Calculation.
A European astronomer has recently
made some remarkable calculations.
He figures that if all the living repre
sentatives of the human race were
strung out in space and separated froai
each other by intervals of a mile the
line would only reach one-third of the
distauccto the planet Neptune. If sep
arated by distances as great as that be
tween London and Constantinople the
line would only roach halfway to the
nearest star.

"How did you find out you could

teacher on the blackboard, and the
marks came from the teacher's cane."

ous. One of the old family retainers Is
a Scotchman named William, who does
not believe in glossing over the truth
for tho sake of sparing his listener's
feelings. The woman in question, al
though possessed of considerable charm
of manner, is not a beauty and knows
it. Her husband, recently deceased,
was a remarkably handsome man, and
his wife was one of his sincerest ad
mirers. One day when she was looking
at her husband's picture on the mantel
in tho sitting room William was fuss
ing around tho grate, and in a moment
of impulse she asked:
"William, what do you think made
such a handsome man as Colonel S.
marry such a plain woman as me?"
William looked from the portrait to
the speaker, meditated a second and
answered:
''Must have been heaven's will,
ma'am."
Tbe African Drum.
The Africa* drum appears in varied
and often picturesque forms. The na
tives make drums out of shells, tree
trunks or earthenware, covered with
the skin of some wild animal or some
times with India rubber. Of the origi
nal calabash drums there Is probably
only one specimen in Europe. Some of
the drums am highly ornamented
either by painting or carving. One
specimen, indeed, has puzzled travelers,
for there is depicted on it unmistaka
bly a cross and also a head of European
type. A drum found In upper Lualaha
lias a unique peculiarity in the way of
a "sympathetic cord," formed by means
of a small tube Ingeniously inserted In
the side of the instrument, which
causes, when the drum is beaten, a vi
bration resembling that of the reed
pipe.— Southern Workman.
A Plea For Soap,
A learned doctor, pleading for soup
on every dinner table, says: "A person
comes to dinner weary and hungry
and needs first something to stimulate
the secretions of the stomach. The
first course, hot soup, does this by its
action upon the nerves which control
the blood vessels. Taking the soup
slowly is an aid to digestion, and if
not a favorite dish fish or oysters can
be substituted, serving the same pur
pose. The joint or roast can then be
taken with benefit to the system, and
the game, vegetables and sweets
should follow In their order, not nec
essarily in courses for the plain fam
ily dinner, however."
A Dilemma.
A well known college professor offers
the two horns of a dilemma to advo
cates of coeducation.
"If you lecture to twenty boys and
twenty girls in the same room," he
asks, "will tho boys attend to the lec
ture or to the girls ?"
Of course the coeducatlonist, to be
consistent, must say that they will
listen to the lecture.
"Well, if they do," replies the dean,
"they are not worth lecturing to."—

CLEVER LADY NAVIGATOR.
MRS, UOSB WATKIXS GRANT
BD PHOT'S LICENSE ON
ILLINOIS RIVER.
A Model Housekeeper and Expert
Cook— Assists in Painting Engines
of Steamer— Husband is Engineer
of Boat of Which She is Pilot.
In the early spring of this year
when the Steamboat Inspectors began
their examinations at Chicago of tue
various applicants for license to handle
steamers on the Illinois River, they
were somewhat startled over the ap
pearance of Mrs. Rose E. Watkins in
the class, and only after a most thor
ough test as to her ability to handle
a steamer was she issued a license.
Mrs. Watkins is the wife of Cap
tain George T. Watkins and they own
the boat with which they navigate the
waters of the Illinois. For the last
eight years Mrs. Watkins has made
her home on her husband's boats.
Their home was originally at Peoria,
where Mrs. Watkins spent her girl
hood days and before her marriage to
Captain Watkins had taught school.
EXPERT IN RIVER NAVIGATION.
For the last four years they have
put in the summer conducting an ex
cursion business between Chicago and
the scenic points down the Illinois
River, including Starved Rock and the
ravines and canyons surrounding it.
Mrs. Watkins has been for years an
expert in navigating these waters, but
not until this spring did she formally
apply for a pilot's license. While
classed as a navigable stream, it has
generally been regarded that the navi
gation of the Illinois ended at La Salle,
but in spite of this, the Watkins and
one or two smaller craft have been
regularly plying the upper reaches of
the river. Last winter the steamboat
men were notified that the boats on
this section would have to comply with
all the government regulations to
carry regularly licensed pilots and
engineers.
A few weeks later Inspectors Mans
field and Peck came to Ottawa to in
spect the Watkins. Since Mrs. Wat
kins has secured her pilot's license
there have been all sorts of stories in
circulation as to that inspection. One
romance reads that the inspectors
found her seated at a table in the
pilot house poring over a chart look
ing up the location of a recently dis
covered rock. It is a pity to spoil
such a beautiful romance, but these
are the hard, utilitarian facts in the
case: The pilot house of the Watkins
is too small to hold a table and Mrs.
Watkins is much too busy to pore
over a chart at this season of the year.
Then the only really dangerous "snag"
in the river at Starved Rock is the ad
mission fee which the corporation that
owns It charges before the sightseer

is permitted to set foot on the shore
at that beautiful and historic spot.
The plain facts in the case are. that
■when the inspectors made their offi
cial visit to the boat Mrs. Watkins w •
engaged in painting the engines. Dur
ing the winter months the two Cap
tains Watkins were engaged in over
hauling and renovating their boat —
no small task when one remembers
that the boat can carry GOO passengers
on its two decks.
As a result of the examination
which they recently underwent at
Chicago, _ Captain Oeorge Watkins
holds an engineer's and a master's
license, while his wife holds a license
as master and pilot which entitles her
to pilot any craft up to ion tons bur
den upon the waters of the Illinois

and its tributaries. Mrs Watkins is a
modest and relived woman who is not
given to boasting of her exploits along
lines into which women seldom ven
ture. But she takes a pardonable de
gree of pride in the fact that she is
not an amateur pilot but is the real
thing in that line.
DISPLAYS UNCOMMON ABILITY.
When the excursion season closes
the Watkins not infrequently seek
other business in the ,ate fall and
early spring on the lower reaches of
the river and it is while engaged in
this work that Mrs. Watkins has the
opportunity to display her real ability
as a navigator. She has brought the
boat up the river in all conditions of
wind and current and that, too, when
it was Handling a great barge piled
high with props for the Spring Valley
mines or with great walnut logs for
a piano factory at Chicago.
As to her ability to handle a crew
of deck hands there is a determined
glint in her eye which indicates that
she can do that also, and she can cook
for them as well as she can direct

their labors on board. There is noth
ing mannish or strenuous or new wom
anish about this lady master of the
steamer Watkins — she is a model
housekeeper and is household guard
ian angel for all the crew who dwell
upon the boat. This is the plain
story of a good woman, refined,
pleasant and energetic, who does the
work that comes to her thoroughly and
who is surprised that her ability to
handle a fair-sized fresh water craft
should have attracted the attention
that it undoubtedly has.
Interstate Commerce Commission.
An opinion at one time prevailed
that the members of the Interstate
commerce commission had an easy
time. A place on the board was char
acterized in the slang of the day as
a "soft snap." However f his may
once have been, it is not true now.
The dispatches show that not only is
the commission a very busy body, but
that its activities are yielding much
important information. Its inquiries
into the methods of the railroads in
terested in coal, and into the practices
of the Standard Oil Company in ab
sorbing or freezing out opposition, are
in the highest degree valuable to the
public, and should lead to the redress
ing of many abuses. If the board
were composed of twenty members, all
could find work at this time in the
field which as yet has been but
scratched.

Alfonso killed twenty-throe birds out
of a possible twenty-nine. There has
been some improvement in Spanish
marksmanship in recent years.
JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY, CAL., JULY G, 1906.
CONGRESSMEN ARRESTED.
TWO DOZEN OF THEM GATHERED
IN AT BASEBALL GAME BY
OFFICIAL OF HOUSE.
President's Son-ln-Law Among Those
Corraled by Sergeant-at Ai ins. -
Trouble Caused by Minority reader
Williams.
That the Members of Congress are
fond of a ball game was evidenced a
few days ago -when a call of the
House — a ■ desire to obtain a quorum
of the members — caused the Sergeant
at-Arms of that body to send out his
deputies to arrest whatever members
his squad could corral. Twenty-two
Congressmen were gathered up from
the grandstand and bleachers of the
Washington Baseball Club, Mr. Nich
olas Longworth and his wife being
brought in from the President's box.
It was a delightful spring afternoon
and the House was droning along
through its business, with John Sharp
Williams filibustering and forcing roll
calls on everything possible, including
the question of a quorum. The
weather, as heretofore stated, was
fine, and the "call of the ball game"
.was strong upon the fans of the
House. They heeded it and went, and
then Mr. Williams became unkind,
there was a call for a quorum, and the
Sergeant-at-Arms went after the de
liquents.
The officers rounded up stray mem
bers from all parts of the grounds,
and in the executive box found the
popular bridegroom from Ohio, witli
his wife. They are both lovers of the
game, as well as otherwise, and the
humor of the situation was slow in
dawning on them. But they could
not resist or argue with constituted
authority. They gave parole to pro
ceed at once to the Capitol. They had
come in Mrs. Longworth's pretty auto
mobile, and on the return trip they
took with them Representative Games
of West Virginia.
Representative Sibley, of Pennsyl
vania, with a party of eight members,
also went back to the Capitol in an
automobile and on the way was held
up by a bicycle policeman for exceed
ing the speed regulations, but when
the situation was explained to the of
ficer, they were allowed to proceed.
A few moments later the auto party
was filing in at the door of the House.
The roll call was awaiting them.
They marched in, voted, turned on
their heels and went straight back to
the machine. Before the authorities
could get busy they were again speed
ing toward the ball park.
HORSES WERE TOO SLOW.
A number of the statesmen who
were hustled back to the Capitol in
carriages were not so fortunate as the
Sibley party. They arrived so late
that it wasn't worth while to return
to the ball park.
A number of the truants are dyed
in-the-wool fans, some making regular
but not daily excursions to the ball
park, while others can afford to es
chew the affairs of state every day to
see a game. On the occasion of their
arrest, a number had made their first
visit to see the ball thrown around.
Before the House was called to order
the next day the delinquents gathered
about to hold a consultation meeting.
"It was too bad that we had to
leave just when there was a chance
for Washington to tie the score, with
three men on bases," wailed Repre
sentative Sherman, of New York,
chairman of the Republican Congres
sional campaign committee.
"Oh, go on," added Congressman
McKinley, of Illinois, "our Chicago
team is too strong for the Nationals.
Their pitcher struck out the next two
men up, leaving your three still hang
ing on their bases." ,
"Of course it was up to that Cali
fornia recruit on the home team to
make the star stunt of the day," added
Representative McKinley, who hails
from Santa Rosa, Cal.
Others in the gathering seemed to
assail Representative Sibley for coax
ing them to leave the House for a
ball game, as they considered it a

Wellman and the Pole.
As the time draws near for Walter
Wollman. the newspaper correspond
ent, to make his proposed "dash for
the North Pole" by means of an air
ship, the world at large is waking.' up
to the vast daring and importance of
the attempt. The scheme cuts adrift
absolutely from all other of the time- !
honored methods of traveling over the i
eternal ice of the Arctic zone. Mr. I
Wellman is no novice in arctic travel, I
as he has already made one attempt '
for the Pole, in the old fashioned way. I
Fr,om Spitsbergen, Wellman, to- j
gether with Maj. Henry 1!. Hersey,
representing the United States
Weather Bureau, and M. J. Smith, a
wireless operator, will start in the i
biggest airship ever constructed on the
600-mile journey toward the goal of
so many men's desires. ' If the air
ship works and the winds remain true
to the analysis of them made by the
Nansen expedition, the thing h done. >
The North Pole is a terribly illusive
sort of nonentity, and a thousand un
foreseen calamities may be ready to
pounce upon Walter Wellman and his
plucky associates. Yet the quest is
not an absolutely forlorn hope. To the
American newspaper man may yet be
given the honor of locating the North
Pole, just as to a British newspaper
man was given the glory of cut ■
Africa in twain.
The Princess" Bridal Dress.
( Princess Ena's wedding dress at
tracted great interest in Spain, as it
is truly a Spanish product, In fabric
and finish, except for the wonderful
Brussels lace, which was brought to
adorn it. It was a fancy of the
King and of the Queen-mother that
the wedding dress should !>e made in
Spain, and the Princess Ena graciously
fell in with this patriotic sentiment.
The dress X therefore, one of the
special presents from the King and is
a marvel of elegance.
The silk was manufactured from a
special pattern in one of the large
Spanish silk establishments. It was
made up with all the artistic skill of
the court dressmakers. The silk is
heavily overlaid m ith wonderful silver
embroidery, with soft frills of the
finest Brussels lace, said to have cost
$50 a yard. The laces were publicly
exhibited before being put on the
dress, and excited the admiration and
astonishment of even the aristocratic
ladles of Madrid. Orange blossoms
were profusely used with the silver
embroideries and laces for the corsage.
"THERE WAS NOT A BATTLE BUT SIR NIGEL WAS IN THE HEART OF IT.
and even in dainty clusters along the
train, which is four yards long.
According to Spanish traditions, the
bride must afterward present this
wedding dress to the Virgin de la
Paloma, the popular protectress of
maternity.
"Naive" Questions.
Mrs. Alexander, the novelist, lives in
Florence. There a young American
woman recently interviewed her.
"Mrs. Alexander was delightful," said
the young woman. "She amused me
very much. I, too, amused her — ehe
thought me naive.
"Once, when I asked her a certain
question about the financial side of
novel writing, she declared that my
question was as naive as that of a
little Florentine child's that she had
heard about the day before.
"This child, at dinner with her par
ents, turned to her mother and said:
" 'Mamma, where were yon born?'
" "At Padua, darling.'
" 'But I was born in Florence, wasn't
I?'
" 'Yes, dear.'
" 'And father, where was he born?'
" 'In Venice.'
"The little girl looked gravely from
one to the other.
" 'Isn't it funny,' she said, 'that we
should all have met like this.' "

CHAPTER 111.
Though it was an autumn evening
and somewhat warm, a huge fire of
heaped billets of wood crackled and
sparkled in a broad, open grate, some
of the smoke escaping up a nule chim
ney, but the greater part rolling oat
into the room, so that the iJr was
thick with it, and a man coming from
without could scarr catch his breath.
On this fire a great caldron bubbled
and simmered, giving forth a rich and
promising smell. Seated round it
were a dozen or so folk, of all a.^-es
and conditions, who set up such a
shout as Alleyne entered that he
stood peering at them through the
smoke, uncertain what this greeting
might portend.
"A rouse! A rouse!" cried one
rough-looking fellow in a tattered jer
kin. "One more round of mead or
ale. and the score to the last comer."
" 'Tis the law of the Pied Merlin!'
shouted another. "Ho. there, Dame
Eliza! Here is fresh c-istom come to
the house, and not a drain for the
company."
"I will take your orders, gentles: I
will assuredly take your orders," the
landlady answered, bustling in with
her hands full of leathern drinking
cups. "What is it that you drink,
then? Beer for the lads of the forest,
mead for the gleeman, strong waters
for the tinker, and wine for the rest.
It is an old custom of the house, young
sir. It has been the use at the Pied
Merlin this many a year back that the
company should drink to the health
of the last comer. Is it your pleasure
to humor it?"
"Why, good dame.'' said Alleyne, "I
would not offend the customs of your
house, but it is only sooth when I say
that my purse is a thin one. As tar as
two pence will go, however, I shall
be right glad to do my part."
"Plainly said and bravely spoken
my suckling friar," roared a deep
voice, and a heavy hand fell upon
Alleyne's shoulder. Looking up, he
saw beside him his former cloister
companion, the renegade monk, Hordle
John.
"By the thorn of Olastonbury! ill
days are coming upon Beaulieu,"
said he. "Here they have got rid in
one day of the only two men within
their walls — for I have had mine eyes
upon thee, youngster, and I know
that for all thy baby face there is the
making of a man in thee."
While he was speaking the landlady
came in again, bonring a broad platter,
upon which stood all the beakers nnd
flagons charged to the brim with the
brown ale or the ruby wine. Behind
her came a maid with a high pile of
wooden plates, nnd a great sheaf of
•poons. one of which she handed round
to each of the travellers. Two of the
company, who were dressed in the
weather-stained green doublet of for

estei=. lifted the big pot off the fire,
and a third, with a huge pewter ladle,
served out a portion of steaming col
lops to each guest. Alleyne bore his
share and his ale-mug away with him
to a retired trestle in the corner, where
he could sup in peace and watch the
strange scene, which was so different
from those silent and well-ordered
meals to which he was accustomed.
Three or four of the men round the
fire were evidently under-keepers and
verderers from tha forest, sunburned
and bearded, with the quick restless
eye and lithe movements of the deer
among which they lived. Close to the
corner of the chimney sat a middle
aged gleeman. clad in a faded garb of
Norwich cloth, the tunic of which was
so outgrown that it did but fasten at
the neck and at the waist His face was
swollen and coarse, and his watery,
protruding eyes spoke of a life which
never wandered very far from the
wine-pot. A gilt harp, blotched with
many stains :ind two of its strings
missing, was tucked under one of his
arms, while with the rther he scooped
greedily at his platter. Next to him
sat two other men of about the same
age, one with a trimming of fur to
his coat, which gave him a dignity
which was evidently dearer to him
than his comfort, for he still drew n
round him in spite of the hot glare of
the fagots. The other, clad in a dirty
russet suit with a long sweeping doub
let, had a cunning foxy face with keen
twinkling eyes and a peaky beard.
Next to him sat Hordle John, and be
side him three other rough unkempt
fellows with tangled beards and
matted hair — free laborers from the
adjoining farms, where small patches
of freehold property had been suffered
rto remain scattered about in the
heart of the royal demesne. The com
pany was completed by a peasant in
a rude dress of undyed sheepskin,
with the old-fashioned galligaskins
about his legs, and a gayly dressed
young man with striped cloak jagged
at the edges and parti-colored hosen,
who looked about him with high dis
dain upon his face, and held a blue
smelling flask to his nose with one
hand while he brandished a busy
spoon with the other. In the corner
a very fat man was lying all asprawl
upon a truss, snoring stertorously, and
evidently in the last stage of drunken
ness.
Alleyne listened to the talk which
went on round the fire.
"Elbow room for Floyting Will!"
cried a woodman. "Twang ua a merry
lilt."
"Aye, aye, the 'Lasses of Lancas
ter,' " one suggested.
"Or 'St. Simeon and the Devil.* "
"Or the 'Jest of Hendy Tobias.' "
To all those suggestions the Jong
leur made no response, but sat with
his eye fixed abstractedly upon the
ceiling, as one who calls words to his
mind. Then, with a sudden sweep
across the strings, he broke out into
a song so gross and so foul that ere
he had finished a verse the pure
minded lad sprang to his feet with
the blood tingling in his face.
"How can you sing such things?"
he cried. "You, too, an old man who
should be an example to others."
The wayfnrers all gazed in the ut
most astonishment at the interruption.
"By the holy Dicon of Hampole! our
silent clerk lias found his tongue,"
said one of the woodmen. "What is
amiss with the song, then? How has
it offended your babyship?"
"A milder and better-mannered song
hath never been liearu within thesewalls!" cried another. "What sort of
talk is this for a public inn?"
"Shall it be a litany, my pood
clerk?" shouted a third: "or would a
hymn be good enough to serve?"
The jongleur had put down his harp
in high dudgeon. "Am I to be
preached to by a child?" he cried,
staring across at Alleyne with an in
flamed and angry countenance. "Is a
hairless infant to raise tongue
against me, when I have sung in every
fair from Tweed to Trent, and have
twice been named aloud by the High
Court of the Minstrels at Beverly? I
shall sing no more to-night."
"Nay, but yon will so," said one of
the laborers. "Hi! Dame Eliza, bring
a stoup of your best to Will, to clear
his throat. Go forward with thy song,
and if our girl-faced clerk does not
love It he can take to the road and go
whence he came."
"Nay, but not too fast," broke in
Hordle John. "There are * words
in this matter. It may be that my
little comrade has been over-quick in
reproof, he having gone early into the
cloisters and seen little of the rough
ways and words of the world. Yet
there is truth in what he says, for as
you know well, the song was not of
the cleanest. I shall stand by him,
therefore, and he shall neither be put
out on the road, nor shall his ears be
offended indoors."
"Indeed, your high and mighty
grace," sneered one of the yeomen,
"have you in sooth so ordained?"
"By the Virgin!" said a second, "I
think that you may both chance to
find yourselves upon the road before
long."
"And so belabored as to be scarce
able to tfrawl along it," cried a third.
"Nay, I shall go! I fehall go!" said
Alleyne hurriedly, as Hordle John be
gan to roll up his sleeves, and bare
an arm like a leg of mutton. "I would
not have you brawl about me."
"Hush, lad!" he whispered, "I
count them not a fly. They may find
they have more tow on their distaff
than they know how to spin. Stand
thou clear and give me space."
Both the foresters and the laborers
had risen from their bench, and Dame
Eliza and the travelling doctor had
flung themselves between the two
parties with soft words and soothing
gestures, when the door of the Pied
Merlin was flung violently open, and
the attention of the company was
drawn from their own quarrel to the
new-comer who had burst so uncere
moniously upon them.
CHAPTER IV.
He was a middle-sized man, of most
massive and robust build, with an
arching chest and extraordinary
breadth of shoulder. His shaven face
was as brown as a hazel-nut, tanned
and dried by the weather, with harsh
well-marked features, which were not
Improved by a long white scar which
stretched from the corner of bis left
nostril to the angle of the jaw. His
eyes were bright and searching, with
something of menace and of authority
in their quick glitter, and his mouth
was firm-set and hard, as befitted one
who was wont to set his face against
danger. A straight Rword by his side
and a painted long-bow jutting over
his shoulder proclaimed his profession,
while his scarred brigandine of chain
mail and his dinted steel cap showed
that he was no holiday soldier, but one
who was even now fresh from the
wars. A white surcoat, with the Lion
of St. George in red upon the centre,
covered his bjroad breast, while a
sprig of new-plucked broom at the
Bide of his head-gear gave a touch of
"HORDLE JOHN HURLED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM SO THAT HIS HEAD CRACKED AGAIN ST~THB WALL."
gayety and grace to his grim, war
worn equipment.
"La petite is frightened," said he.
"Ah, e'est I'amour, l'amour! Cur?e
this trick of French, which will stick
to my throat. I must wash it out
with some good English ale. By my
hilt! camarades, there is no drop of
French blood in my body, and I am a
true English bowman, Samkin Aylward
by name; and I tell you, mes amis, that
it warms my very heart-roots to set
my feet on the dear old land once
more. When I came off the galley at
Hythe, this very day, I down on my
bones, and I kissed the good brown
earth, as I kiss thee now, ma belle, for
it was eight long years since I had
seen it. The very smell of it seemed
life to me. But where are my six ras
cals? Hola, there! En avant!"
At the order, six men, dressed as
common drudges, mat Ued solemnly
into the room, each bearing a huge
bundle upon his head They formed in
military line, while the soldier stood
,1n front of them with stern eyes,
checking off their several packages.
"Number one — a French feather-bed
•with the two counterpanes of white
Bandell," said he.
"Here, worthy sir," answered the
first of the bearers, laying a great
package down in the corner.
"Number two — seven ells of red
Turkey cloth and nine ells of cloth of
gold. Put it down by the other. Good
dame, I prythee give each of these
men a bottrine of wine or a jack of
ale. Three — a full piece of white
Genoan velvet with twelve ells of
purple silk. Thou rase J, there is
dirt on the hem! Thou hast brushed
it against some wall, coquin!"
"Not I, most worthy sir," cried the
carrier, shrinking away from the fierce
eyes of the bowman.
"I say yes, dog! By the three kings!
I have seen a man gasp out his
breath for less. Had you gone
through the pain and unease that I
have done to earn these things you
would be at more care. I swear by my
ten finger bones that there is not one of
them that hath not cost its weight in
French blood! Four — a incense-boat,
a ewer of silver, a gold buckle, and a
cope worked in pearls. I found them,
camarades, at the Church of St. Denis
In the harrying of Narbonne, and I
took them away with me lest they
fall into the hands 'f the wicked.
Five— a cloak of fur turned up with
minever, a gold goblet with stand and
cover, nnd a box of rose-colored sugar.
See that you lay them together. Six—
a box of moneys, three pounds of Li
mousine gold-work, a pair of boots,
silver tagged, and, lastly, a store of
naplng linen. So, the tally is com
plete! Here Is a groat apiece, and you
may go."
"Go whither, worthy sir?" asked one
of the carriers.
"Whither? To the devil, if ye will.
What is it to me? Now, ma belle, to
supper. A pair of cold capons, a mor
tress of brawn, or what you will, with
a flask or two of the right Gascony. I
have crowns In my pouch, my sweet,
and I mean to spend them. Bring in
wine while the food is dressing. Bu
vons, my brave lads! You shall each
empty a stoup with me."
Here was an offer which the com
pany in an English inn, at that or
any other date, are slow to refuse. The
flagons were regathered. and came
back with the white foam dripping
over their edges. Two of the wood
men and three of the laborers drank
their portions off hurriedly and troop
ed off together, for their homes were
distant and the hour late. The others,
however, drew closer, leaving the
place of honor to the right of the glee
man to the free-handed newcomer. He
had thrown off his steel cap and his
brigandine, and had placed them with
his sword, his quiver, and his painted
long-bow, on the top of his varied
heap of plunder in the corner. Now,
with his thick and somewhat bowed
legs stretched in front of the blaze, his
green jerkin thrown open, and a great
quart pot In his corded fist, he looked
the picture of comfort and good-fel
lowship. His hard-set face had soft
ened, and the thick crop of crisp brown
curls which had been hidden by his
helmet grew low upon his massive
neck. He might have been forty years
of age, though hard toll and harder
pleasure had left their Brim marks
upon his features. Alleyne sat, star-
Ing with open eyes at a type of man
so strange and so unlike any whom
he had met. Men had been good oi
had been bad In his catalogue, but
here was a man who was fierce one
Instant and gentle the next, with a
curse on his lips and a smile In his
eye. What was to be made of such a
man as that?
It chanced that the soldier looked
up and saw the questioning glance
which the young clerk threw upon
him. He raised his flagon and drank
to him, with a merry flash of his white
teeth.
"A toi, mon garcon!" he cried. "Hast
surely never seen a man-at-arms, that
thou shouldst stare so?"
"I never have," said Alleyne frank
ly, "though I have oft heard talk of
their deeds."
"By my hilt!" cried the other, "if
you were to cross the narrow sea you
would find them as thick as bees at a
teehole. Couldst not shoot a bolt down
any street of Bordeaux, I warrant, but
you would pink archer, squire or
knight.
"And where got you all those pretty
things?" asked Hordle John, pointing
at the heap In the corner.
"Where there is as much more wait-
ing for any brave lad to pick it up.
Where a good man can always earn a
good wage, and where he need look upon
no man as his paymaster, but just
reach his hand out and help himself.
Aye, it i* a goodly and a proper life.
And here I drink to mine old comrades,
and the saints be with them! A rjuse
all together, mes enfants, under pain
of my displeasure! To Sir Claude La
tour and the White Company!"
"Sir Claude Latour and the White
Company!" shouted the travellers,
draining off their goblets.
"Well quaffrd, mes braves! It is for
me to fill your cups again, since you
have drained them to my dear lads of
the white Jerkin. Hola, mon ange,
bring wine and ale. How runs the old
stave?"
"We'll drink altogether
To the gray goose feather,
And to the land where the gray goose
flew."
He roared out the catch in a harsh
unmusical voice, and ended with a
shout of laughter. "I trust thit I am
a better bowman than a minstrel,"
said he.
"Methinks I have some remembrance
of the lilt," remarked the gleeman,
running his fingers over the strings.
"Hoping that it will give thee no
offence, most holy sir"— with a vicious
snap at Alleyne— "and with the kind
permit of the company, I will venture
upon it."
Many a time in the after days Al
leyne Edrickson seemed to see that
scene, for all that so many which were
stranger and more stirring were soon
to crowd upon him. The fat, red-faced
gleeman, the listening: group, the arch
er with upraised finger beating in time
to the music, and the huge sprawling
figure of Hordle John, all thrown into
red light and black shadow by the
flickering fire in the centre— memory
was to come often lovingly back to it.
At the time he was lost in admiration
at the deft way In which the jongleur
disguised the loss of his two missing
strings, and the lusty, hearty fashion
in which he trolled out his little ballad
of the outland bowmen, which ran in
some such fashion as this:
"What of the bow?
The bow was made In England:
Of true wood, of yew wood.
The wood of English bows;
So men who are free
Love the old yew-tree
And the land where the yew tree grows.
"Whnt of the cord?
The cord was made In England:
A rough cord, a tough cord,
A cord thnt bowmen love;
So we'll drain our jacks
To the English flax
And the land where the nemp was wove.
"Whnt of the shaft?
The shaft was cut In England:
A long shaft, a strong shaft.
Barbed nnd trim and true;
So we'll drink all together
To the gray goose feather
And the land where the gray goose flew.
"What of the men?
The men were bred In England:
The bowmen — the yeomen —
The lads of dale and fell.
Here's to you — and to yon!
To the hearts that are true
And the land where the true hearts dwell."
"Well sung, by my hilt!" shouted the
archer, in high delight. "Many a
night have I heard that song, both in
the old war-time and after, in the days
of the White Company, when Black
Simon of Norwich would lead the
stave, and four hundred of the best
bowmen that ever drew string would
come roaring In upon the chorus. 1
have seen old John Hawkwood, the
same who has led half the company
into Italy, stand laughing in his beard
as he heard It, until his plates rattled
again. But to get the full smack of
It ye must yourselves be English bow
men, and be far off upon an outland
soil."
"It passes mp," he cried, "how all
you lusty fellows can bide scratching
your backs at home when there are
such doings over the seas. Look at
me — what have I to do? It is but the
eye to the cord, the cord to the shaft,
and the shaft tn the mark. There Is
the whole song of it.
"And the wage?" asked a laborer.
"You see what the wage brings," he
answered. "I eat of the best. I treat
my friend, and I ask no friend to
treat me. I clap a silk gown upon
my girl's back. Never a knight's lady
shall be better betrlmmed and be
trinketed. How of all that, mon gar
con? And how of the heap of trifles
that you can see f»r yourselves in
yonder corner? They are from the
South French, every one, upon whom
I have been making war. By my hilt!
camarades, I think that I may let my
plunder speak for Itself."
Though there may be peace between
our own provinces and the French,
yet within the marches of France
there is always war, for the country
is much divided against itself, and la
furthermore harried by bands of flay
ers, skinners, Brabacons, tardvenus,
and the rest of them. When every
man's grip Is on his neighbor's throat,
and every flve-sous-piece of a baron Is
marching with tuck of drum to fltrht
whom he will, it would be a strange
thing if five hundred brave English
boys could not pick up a living. Now
that Sir John Hawkwood hath gone
with the East Anglian lads and the
Nottingham woodmen into the serv
ice of the Marquis of Montferrat to
fight against the Lord of Milan, thf^re
are but ten-score of us left; yet I may
be able to bring some back with" me to
fill the ranks of the White Company.
By the tooth of Peter! it would be a
bad thing if I could not muster many
a Hamptonshire man who would be
ready to strike in under the red flag
of St. George, and the more so if Sir
Nigel Loring of Cristchurch, should
don hauberk once more and take the
lead of us.
"Ah, you would indeed be in luck
then," Quoth the woodman; "for it is
said that, setting aside the prince, and
mayhap good old Sir John Chandos,
there was not in the whole army a
man of such tried courage."
"It is sooth, every of it," the archer
answered. "I have seen him with
these two eyes in a stricken field, and
never did a man carry himself better.
Mon Dieu! yes, ye would not credit it
to look at him, or to hearken tn his
soft voice, but from the sailing from
Orwell down to the foray to Paris, and
that is clear twenty rears, them ws
not a skirmish, onfall, sally, bushment,
escalado, or battle, but Sir Nigfl wns
in the heart of it. Igo now to Christ
church with a letter to him fn teir
Claude Latour, tn ns=k him if hp will
take thp place of Pir John Hawkwood;
and there is the more chance that he
will if I bring one or two likply men
at my heels. What say you, woodman:
wilt leave the bucks to loose a shaft at
a nobler mark?"
The forester shook his head. "I hai'e
wife and child at Emory Down," quoth
he; "I would not leave them for such
a venture."
"You then, young sir?" asked the
archer.

"Nay, I am a man of peace," said
Alleyne Edricson. "Besides I have
other work to do."
"Peste!" growled the soldier, strik
ing his flagon on the board until the
dishes danced again. "What, in the
name of the devil, hath come over the
folk? Why sit ye all moping by the
fireside, like crows round a dead horse,
when there is man's work to be done
within a few short leagues of ye? Out
upon you all, as a set of laggards and
hang-backs! By my hilt! I believe
that the men of England are all in
Prance already, and that what is left
behind are in sooth the women dressed
up in their paltocks and hosen."
"Archer," quoth Hordle John, "you
have lied more than once and more
than twice; for which, and also be
cause I see much in you to mislike, I
am sorely tempted to lay you upon
your back."
"By my hilt! then, I have found a
man at last!" shouted the bowman.
"And, 'fore God, you are a better man
than I take you for if you can lay me
on my back. For seven long years 1
have found no man in the Company
who could make my jerkin dusty."
"We have had enough bobance and
boasting," said Hordle John, rising and
throwing off his doublet. "I will show
you thnt there are b«tt?r mon l"ft in
England than ever -went thieving to
France."
"Pasques Dieu!" cried the archer,
loosening his jerkin, and eyeing his,
foeman over with the keen glance of
one who is a judge of manhood. "I
have only once before seen such a
body of a man. By your leave, my red
headed friend. I should be right sorry
to exchange buffets with you; and I
will allow that there is no man in the
Company who would pull against you
on a rope; so let that bp a salve to your
pride. On the other hand, I should
judge that you have led a life of ease
for some months back, and that my
muscle is harder than your own. I
am ready to wager upon myself
against you, if you are not afeard."
"Afeard, thnu lurden!" growled big
John. "I never saw the face yet of a
man that I was afeard of. Come out,
and m shall see who is the bettet
man."
"But the wager?"
"I have nought to wager. Come out
for the love and the lust of the
thing."
"Nought to wager!" crl d the soldier.
"Why, idiot, you have that which I
covet above all things. It is that big
body of thine that I am after. See now.
I have a French feather bed there,
which I have been at pains to keep
these years back. I had it at the sack
ing of Issodun, and the king himself
hath not such a bod. If you throw me,
it is thine; but, if I throw you, then
•ou ars under a vow to serve the White
Company as long as we be enrolled."
"Then you may bid farewell to your
bed, soldier," roared Hordle John.
"Nay; I shall keep the bed, and 1
shall have you to France in spite of
your teeth, and you shall live to thank
me for it How shall it be, then, my
infant? Collar and elbow, or close
lock, or catch how you can?"
"To the devil with your tricks!" said
John, opening and shutting his great
red hands. "Stand forth, and let me
clip thee."
"Shalt clip me as best you can, then,"
quoth the archer, moving out into the
open space, and keeping a most wary
eye upon his opponent. He had
thrown oft his green jerkin, and his
chest was covered only I. a pink si'k
jupon, or undershirt, cut low in the
neck and sleeveless. Hordle John was
near stripped from his waist upward,
and his huge body, with his great
muscles swelling out like the gnarled
roots of an oak, towered high above
the soldier. The other, however,
though near a foot shorter, was a man
of great strength; .T.d there was a
gloss upon his white skin which was
wanting in the heavier limbs of the
renegade monk. He was quick on his
feet too, and skilled at the game; so
that It was clear, from the poise ot
head and shine of eye, that he counted
the chances to be in his favor. It
would have been hard that night,
through the whole length of England,
to set up a finer pair in the face of
each other.
Big John stood walt Trig In the centre
with a sullen, menac" g ,c, and his
red hair in a bristle, while the archer
paced lightly and swiftly to the right
and the lelt with crooked knee and
hinds advanced. Ther. with n sudden
dash, so swift and fierce t^at the eye
could scarce follow it, he flew in upon
his man and locked h leg around
him. It was a grip that between men
of equal strength would mean a falls
Bnt Hordle John tore him off from him
ts he might a rat, and huWed him
across the room, so that his head
up against the wall.
"Ma foil" cried the bowman, pass
ing his finpprs through his curls, "you
were not far from the feather-bed
then, mon gar."
Nothing daunted, he approached his
man once more: but this time with
more caution than before. With a
quick feint he threw the other off his
guard, and then, bounding upon him
threw his legs round his bull neck'
in the hope of bearing him to the
ground with the sudden shock. With
a bellow of rage Hordle John squeezed
n \Z< \, n hls huge arms; and th en,
Picking him up, cast him down upon
the floor with a force that might well
have splintered a bone or two, had not
the archer with the most perfect cool
ness clung to the other's forearms to
break his fall. As it was, he dropped
upon his feet and kept his balance
though it sent a Jar through his frame
which set every joint a-creaking. He
bounded back from his perilous foe
m_n; but the other, heated by the
bout, rushed madly after him, and so
gave the practised wrestler the very
vantage for which he had planned. As
big John flung himself upon him, the
archer ducked under the great red
hands that clutched for him, and,
catching his man round the thighs,
hurled him over his shoulder— helped
as much by his own mad rush as by
the trained strength of the heave. To
Alleyne's eye, it was as if John had
taken unto himself wings and flown
As he hurtled through the air, with
giant limbs revolving, the lad's heart
was in his mouth; for surely no man
ever yet had such a fall and came
scathless out of it. In truth, hardy as
the man was, his neck had been as
suredly broken had he not pitched
head first on the very midriff of the
drunken artist, who was slumbering so
peacefully in the corner, all unaware
of these stirring doings. The luckless
limner, thus suddenly brought out from
his dreams, sat up with a piercing yell,
while Hordle John bounded back into
the circle almost as rapidly as he had
left it.
"One more fall, by all the saints!"
he cried, throwing out his arms.
"Not I," quoth the archer, pulling on
his clothes. "I have come well out of
the business. I would sooner wrestle
with the great bear of Navarre."
"It was a trick!" cried John.
"Aye was It! By my ten finger
bones! It Is a trick that will add a
proper man to the ranks of the Com
pany!"
"Oh, for that," said the other, "count
it not a fly; for I had promised myself
a good hour ago that I should gro with
thee, since the life seems to be a goodly
and proper one. Yet I would fain have
had the feather-bed."

ADDRESS OP GEORGE H. MAX*
WELL, DEAN OF THE HOME
CROFTERS GILD OF THE
TALISMAN.
Before the Biennial Convention of
the General Federation of Women's
Clubs, at St. Paul, Minn., June
Fourth. 1906.
MADAME PRESIDENT AND DELE
GATES—LADIES AND GENTLE
MEN:
When I received the invitation to be
with you here to-day and speak upon
the subject "Forestry and Home
crafts," as it is announced on the
program, I felt that the occasion was
one of so much importance, and the
opportunity one which I so greatly ap
preciated, that I ought to do some
thing which I rarely do, and that was
to at least think out a speech in ad
vance. I was asked for a manuscript
of it for the press, but I felt that it
was unsafe to give it because I never
did that yet that something tlidn"t
happen that made me lay aside my
speech and talk about something ol*e.
I have a speech ; epared which was
planned to last for half an hour, and
there it is (holding up a card). Now,
I have fifteen minutes to speak, and
I am going to save that speech for
some other occasion, in some other
place, and talk to you about something
which has been suggested to me here
this morning by the address we have
just listened to from Mr. Mills.
I was born in California and spent
my life there (applause from the Cali
fornia delegates) until within a very
few years when my work in the Na
tional Irrigation Movement took me
away from my native state. But I
want to. take advantage of this op
portunity to stand here and make a
plea for the preservation of those
Temples of God — the Big Trees of
California. (Applause.)
I question very much whether those
who are here to-day realize the power
that Is yours, in bringing about rig"it
action, whether it be in congressional
or state legislation. We often say
that this is a government cf the peo
ple, and that it is controlled by their
votes. So it is. But behind the vote
is the thought of the people. It is
public opinion which controls this
country. The vote is merely a regis
tering of that opinion; and the thought
of the people which precedes that
opinion and brings about reforms, is,
In my judgment, often a tiling that
springs from the minds of the women
of the country rather than from the
minds of the men of the country.
I am free to say that In my earlier
years, and before I had a wider ex
perience and opportunities of ob
servation, I was not a believer In giv
ing the ballot to the women. I am
not here to make a plea for that to
day, because I am not so much im
pressed with the importance of it as
others who think that the ballot Is the
main thing. It is the conversation of
the home circle and the thoughts that
spring most often from the minds of
the mothers of the country that con
trol this country. (Applause.)
And although I believe to-day that
the status of the man and the woman,
so far as their rights of citizenship
and rights before the law are con
cerned, should be the same, I want
to lay that conclusion before you
simply as a basis for the broader
statement that women can control
this country by the power of thought
without the ballot. If the women who
are here to-day and those who are af
filiated with you in this great organi
eation, would take up one or two
things as the result of this conference
and go hence and agitate it in every
home circle, and in every women's
club, and in every village and city,
and through the columns of every
newspaper in the land, and by cor
respondence, you could accomplish
within the next twelve months two
great things which would be a record
of accomplishment sufficient for one
year of bard work for your organiza
tion, and that is, first, to save the big
trees of California (Applause); and,
second, to secure the passage of the
bill providing for fprest reserves in
the White Mountains and on the Ap
palachian Range. (Applause.)
If those great trees in California
were once destroyed they could not
be replaced in centuries and probably
never. They were there when Christ
walked the earth. They were there
when Rome shone resplendent jn all
her glory. They were there when
Carthage nestled amid green fields
and. vineyards on the southern shores
of the Mediterranean. They were there
when Palmyra, with all lier magnifi
cence, was the meeting place of the
caravans traveling between Asia and
the Mediterranean country. And to
day they stand there pleading with
their out-spreading branches agaiiwt
ruthless,, destruction to satisfy the
greed of man.
We may go back through history,
and ruined city after ruined city
shows how ephemeral is everything
that man builds. Did is never occur
to you, has it never occurred to those
who are interested in uplifting and
increasing the power for good <>l the
church, and in carrying its missionary
work into the cities and iuto the slums
and into the tenements, where, God
knows, it is needed most of anywhere
on this carth — lias it never occurred to
you that a child nurtured in the tene
ments and in the slums and in the
City flats, and seeing nothing around
It but bricks and mortar and asphalt
and trolley-cars and things that man
has made, lives wh« re there is nothing
to create a conception of a higher
power, and lacks the influence of the
splendid manifestations of nature,
which are the most convincing revela
tion that we have that there is a
Creator, and that there is a God, and
that there should be a faith in reiigion
in the heart of every man.
If you want to make this a religious
nation, as you must if it is to be pre
served, you must get the children of
the cities back to nature, and under
the spell of its influence, or at least
rear them in an environment where
they can see and be convinced by the
miracles of nature's mysteries that
there is "a God who Rules the world
and Rolls the ages on." (Applause.)
And so through you I appeal not
only to the women of the country, but
to the churches of th« country, to put
forth every influence, not only to save
those great trees in California, but to
aid this whole great movement for the
preservation of the forests we have, by
their right use, for the planting of new
forests, and for the scattering through
this great nation, in every state and
territory, of forest plantations that,
when they come to maturity a genera
tion from now, will supply every state
with wood and timber of every kind
for every purpose from Forests and
Tree Plantations within its own bor
ders.
I have no time today to go into de
tails, but if you will go into the South
and see the actual conditions with ref
erence to the water supply on the
streams flowing from the Appalachian
mountains, and study the beauties of
that country, you will be converted
in an instant to the necessity for the
creation of the Appalachian Forest re
serve; and the same thing is true of
the proposed Thlte Mountain Forest
Reservation in New "ngland. Those
Reserves are comparatively small
things in the amount of money in
volved. If we can throw money to the
birds, as a manure spreader throws it
out of the back of a wafcon into thi
field, to build the Panama canal and
manage the conquest of the Philippine
Islands, and' to build huge battleships,
I maintain that we can at least spare
money enough to perpetuate the for
ests that God gave us and for the pres
ervation of all the Internal Resources
of our country at home. (Applause.)
I maintain another thing, and that
is that if the women who are here to
day would go to their homes from this
convention, and take up and study the
possibilities of the development of
Arizona and New Mexico under a
policy -which will reserve for national
control the forests and the water sup
ply which are the only things that
keep that great country from going
back to the desert, you would save
this nation from the infamy of join
ing Arizona and New Mexico in the
bonds of joint statehood. In the face
of your opposition that great wrong
could never be accomplished. All
women in the land should rise up and
protest against it, because it is
abandoning the destiny and develop
ment of the foundation of all the re
sources for horuemaking of those ter
ritories to the unrestrained legislative
control of a legislature which will be
dominated by the most evil political
influences that ever existed in any
state — the offscourings of the worst
political rottenness that ever pre
vailed in Pennsylvania, coupled with
the iniquities that will prevail by
reason of the fact that so large a pro
portion of the population of New
Mexico cannot even speak the English
Language. The joint statehood bill
proposes to give to the control of such
a legislature as that, without any pos
sible check r hinderance, a land grant
of about twenty million acres to
grab and speculate with and graft on
and practically to do with as they
please. (Applause.)
I only want to say in closing: If
you find crime anywLere; If you find
a man gone wrong anywhere; if you
find political corruption or anything
going wroi-j in our political institu
tions, you will fl d, if you trace it
back, that the fault lies In its original
source, at some place or other, in the
fact that there was not the right
kind of a home and the rit'ht
kind of a mother. If you find a
man of strong and sterling character
(or a woman either) you trace it ba'
and you will find that it was because
there was the right kind of a mother,
and the ight kind of a home.
We have heard a good deal lately
about the "man behind the gun and
the ''man behind the pick" and ''the
man behind the ballot" and the "man
behind" a great many o.lier things,
but I want to tell you that you can
pile them all one upon another like
Ossa upon Pelion and all of them to
gether are not of as much importance
as the "Mother behind the Home!"
(Applause.)
If you are to have the right kind of
homes and the right kind of mothers
everywhere throughout ne length and
breadth of this great and beautiful
country of ours, you must make it
easily possible for every man who
works and lives by his toil to have a
home of his own on the land — a
HOMECROFT, hovever small.
You must train every child In
garden schools to know how to plant
seeds and make things grow and get
food directly from the bossom of
Mother Earth. You must so train all
boys and girls that their first great
ambition will be to get a home of
their own with a piece of ground
around it large enough for a garden.
The Good Book tells us that "God
planted a garden eastward in Eden;
and there he put the man whom he
had formed. And out of the ground
made the Lord God to grow every
tree that is pleasant to the sight and
good for food."
God intended that every man and
woman and every child should live
next to nature and on the L.nd, and
every man who marries a woman
should put her in a home in the midst
of a garden.
The great movement which is now
fairly under way, known as the
HOMECROFT MOVEMENT, pr o
pusi's to do that V \v thing, and the
Creed and Platform c" the Houie
crofters tella how it may be done.
The «Wigan of the Homecraft Move
ment N:
"Every Child in a Garden — F.very
Mother In a Homecroft — and Individ
ual Industrial Independence for Every
Worker, in a Home of his Own on the
Land."
Is not that a Cause which should
have the ardent and enthusiastic sup
port and co-operation of every man
and woman, and especially of every
mother in the land?

We believe that the Patriotic Slogan
of the Whole People of this Nation
should be "Every Child in a Garden —
Every Mother in a Homecroft — and In
dhiilual Industrial Independence for
Every Worker in a Home of his Own
on the Land," and that until he owns
such a Home, the concentrated purpose
and chief inspiration to labor in the life
of every wage worker should be his
determination to "Get an Acre and
Live on it."
We believe that the Slums and
Tenements and Congested Centers of
population in the Cities are a savagely
deteriorating social, moral and polit
ical influence, and that a great public
movement should be organized, and
the whole power of the nation and
the states exerted for the betterment
of all the conditions of Rural Life, and
to create and upbuild Centers of So
cial and Civic Life in Country and
Suburban Towns and Villages, where
Trade and Industry can be so firmly
anchored that they cannot be drawn
into the Commercial Maelstrom that
is now steadily sucking Industry and
Humanity into the Vortex of the
Great Cities.
We believe that every Citizen in
this Country has an inherent and
Fundamental Right to an Education
which will train him to Earn a Liv
ing, and, if need be, to get his living
straight from Mother Earth; and that
he has the same right to the Opportun
ity to have the Work to Do which will
afford him that living, and to earn not
only a comfortable livelihood, but
enough more to enable him to be a
Homecrofter and to have a Home of
his Own, with ground around it
sufficient to yield him and his family
a Living from the Land as the reward
for his own lalior.
We believe that the Public Domain
is the most precious heritage of the
people, and the surest safeguard the
nation has against Social Unrest. Dis
turbance or Upheaval, and that the
Cause of Humanity and the Preserva
tion of Social Stability and of our Free
Institutions demand that the absorp
tion of the public lands into specula
tive private ownership, without settle
ment, be forthwith stopped; and that
the nation should create opportunities
for Homecrofters by building irriga
tion and drainage works to reclaim
■
l land as fast as it is needed to give
e every man who wants a Home on the
L Land a chance to get it.
W We believe that, as a Nation, we
s should be less absorbed with Making
M Money, and should pay more heed to
r raising up and training Men who will
b bc Law- Abiding Citizens; that the wel
ffare of our Workers is of more con-
s sequence than the mere accumulation
o of Wealth; and that Stability of Na
ttional Character and of Social and
B Business Conditions is of greater im-
p portance to the people of this country
a as a whole than any other one ques
ttion that is now before them; and we
b believe that the only way to Preserve
s such Stability, and to Permanently
M Maintain our National Prosperity, Is
t to carry info immediate effect and
o operation the Platform of the Talis-
m man, which is as follows;
E EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT AND

THIS remarkably interesting and stimulating book has
been ev«rywh«re welcomed as a most valuable con-
tribution to the thought of the present day.
THERE IS IN IT THE INSPIRATION OF
HIGH AND PATRIOTIC IDEALS
It sheds a new light, bright, clear and convincing, in its
common-sense optimism, upon the conditions that confront the
nation to-day. Everyone who reads it will go forward with a
clearer vision of the future of our country and with renewed
courage and faith in the cause of the people.
Theodore C. Williams, late Master of the Hackley School,
New York, in a San Francisco paper, declares that "it gives the
profoundest thought with a transparent simplicity and charm
that make it universally readable. It speaks as a friend to a
friend. It has the rare eloquence of perfect ease and clearness."
The London Spectator calls it "a healthy and virile essay."
The Bradford (England) Observer, speaking of its reality
and reasonableness, says it is " a very revelation."
These are only a few from hundreds of encomiums com-
mending the book for its timeliness.
It should be read by all who feel the pressure of

But we are doing it because the magazine
speaks for itself and tells its own story.
Here is what one ot our subscribers at Crockett, Texas,
writes:
"The March number of your excellent magazine is before
me. It is certainly filled with helpful articles, and I would be
glad to know that every family in Texas had the benefit of its
teachings. The first article in this number, • A Homecrofter's
Garden," should be preserved for reference. The Article
' Health in the Home,' if carefully followed, would save
sickness in every family. Anything that I can do to assist
you in extending your circulation in Texas will be gladly

UNITED OWNERSHIP OF LAND

8. That it shall be the law of every
state and of the United States, that
beneficial use is the basis, the meas
ure, and the limit of all rights to
water, including riparian rights, and
that the right to the use of water for

purtenant to the land irrigated, so that
the ownership of the land and the
water shall be united, and no right to
water as a speculative commodity
ever be acquired, held or owned.
EIGHT OF APPROPRIATION FOR
BENEFICIAL USE.
9. That it shall be the law of every
state and of the United States, that
all unused and unappropriated waters
are public property, subject to appro
priation for a beneficial use, first in
time being first in right, and that on
all interstate streams, priority of use
shall give priority of right, through
out the entire course of the stream,
without regard to state lines, and
that in each drainage basin the irri
gators therein shall control the distri
bution of the water.Senator Beveridsre presented a rad
ical amendment to the agricultural ap
propriation bill the other day which
was passed promptly. Back of the
ease and celerity with which this ac
tion was accomplished is a story. It
is an interesting one too, for it shows
how the President for once, at least,
was able to bold the big stick over the
Senate, and the great packing inter
ests and forced the amendment with
which he was in accord.
The rider that was tacked on to the
$7,800,000 appropriation bill in the
Senate at the last moment without
discussion, provides for the same sort
of an inspection of meats for home
consumption that is provided for those
which are sent abroad. It will cost
the great packing house industry sev
eral million dollars eacli year, for
they will have to pay for the inspec
tion. When the question came up be
fore Congress as to who should as
sume the expense of this work the
packing house lobby objected stren
uously to putting up any money for it,
notwithstanding the fact that some
months ago when there was an in-
THE ORIGINAL SWIFT MEAT-PACKING PLANT, CHICAGO.
sufficient appropriation for foreign in
spection, a number of large packing
bouse concerns voluntarily offered to
defray the cost involved.
CONSUMER PATS COST ANYWAY.
It Is stated that, of course, the pack
ing house people, otherwise the beef
trust, will pass the cost of the Inspec
tion along to the consumer; but as it
will only amount to about 5 or 6 cents
a head on each carcass the increase
will not be appreciable in the individ
ual beef steak, at least it ought not to
be, but the combination of packers,
dealers, wholesalers, retailers, etc.,
will doubtless make an excuse for put
ting up meat at least a cent a pound,
and thus make an investment of many
hundred per cent, off the amount
which they pay for the Government
Inspection.
HOW THE TROUBLE BEGAN.
Some time ago Upton Sinclair pub
lished "The Jungle." It was a novel
and horrible. It showed that the in
spection service at the Chicago pack-
Ing houses was wholly inadequate. It
was proved that the Government in
spectors passed on the conditions of
the carcasses when the animals were
killed; but after that there were no
Inspections and the conditions wore
Incredibly revolting. Presici nt Roos^
velt read the book and is stated to
have 'been outraged at the statements
made. Were they true or were they
exaggerated? He made some inquiri s
and found that the statements wore nil
well founded. Then he was genuinely
angry. Secretary Wilson sent a comm
ission out to look into the condition
of affairs, but the President was ap
parently not satisfied with the Govern
ment commission, so he sent his close
personal friend, Mr. J. B. Reynolds, a
prominent social worker and a man of
means, and Mr. Charles P. Xeill, the
United States Commissioner of Labrr,
on a purely personal inspection tour.
The expenses of the two investigators
were paid by the Government, but the
men received no salaries and the in
quiry was, in a way, unofficial.
There has never yet been any writ
ten report made public from these two
Investigators; likely there will not be;
but the President knows all they
found out, and the packers know it
too. Both the I*resident and the
packers were horrified; the reasons
were different. The story around the
Capitol regarding this investigation
runs something like this: The packers
said, "If this sort of a story gets out
It will ruin our business abroad." The
President remarked in effect, "If ill
that I know gets out, it will ruin
your business at home too."
"Now," said the packers, "make any
sort of an inspection law you want,
pass it and we will stand for it, and
promise to ho good in thp future, but
do not make a public scandal of this
matter."
FOR A STIUCT INSPECTION I,AW.
The President is reported to hnve
intimated that he was willing, and the
Inspection law will be passed, with- 1

GUY ELLIOTT MITCHELL
out scandal if it can be, but with
scandal if It must. He recognized that
there were many innocent interests
which would be severely damaged by
the publication of this report What
he was after principally was results
for the future.
There is another peculiar feature
which is having some weight in the
ease with which the inspection law
gets past what would ordinarily be an
almost insurmountable barrier. It
seems that Mr. Sinclair is writing an
other book. It will be more damaging
than the Jungle. It is to be an expose
of the whole packing business from
the report of the "Embalmed Beef
Commission" down to the present time
— and the combination of official docu
ments and statements of eye wit
nesses. When this book appears the
packers are very anxious f o be able
to say that the practices alluded to
therein are a thing of the past "and
that no such conditions can exist un
der the present Government Inspec
tion."
The new act provides an inspection
that does not stop at the gate of the
packing house, but follows the animal
through all departments until it
reaches the can or the cooler.
There is some antagonism presented
to the bill in the House, on the
grounds of constitutionality and other
excuses, but if any actual opposition
should develop it will mean a thor
ough hearing in committee on both
sides of the question and it is pre
sumed that this is about the last thing
the packers actually desire.
Seldom, if ever, has the public been
more aroused over any public question.
The fact that the meat consumption
entered vitally into every home,
coupled with the terrible charges,
made not only in the "Jungle," but
through many other credible sources,
has aroused a state of public senti
ment which is akin to revolutionary.
On the whole, in the face of an in
tensely suspicious public, an aroused
Congress and a determined President,
the beef trust is now up against the
fight of its life. While the President
intended to use his private report as a
club to force legislation, and to with
hold its publication unless it was
found necessary to bring the packers
to terms, the overwhelming current

of aroused public Indignation will
likely force its publication. Indeed
the amount of damaging and disgust
ing details which are being mnde
known dny after day in the daily
press, from information given by
various people who are in a positkn
to know the facts, would seem to In
dicate that but little additional dam
age to anybody could be accomplished
through the publication of the report.
GOVERNMENT HOLDS TRUMP
CARDS.
Commenting on the question of the
constitutionality of the amendment if
it should become a law, in that it in
terferes with state rights, a prominent
Government official remarked that in
any event the packers could be forced
to terms. They are very anxious over
their great foreign meat trade and
this is largely dependent upon Govern
ment inspection of carcasses. Abroad
the Government inspection tag Is
looked upon as a guarantee, and with
out it foreign meat trade would suffer
inestimably. Should the packers re
fuse to allow the Government to in
spect food for home consumption, the
Government could In its turn refuse
to inspect meats for export
NEILL REPORT PUBLISHED.
After some consideration of the wis
dom of publishing ttie Neill report and
yielding to the public clamor of all
sections of the country for a knowl
edge of its contents, the President
sent a message to Congress transmit
ting it for the consideration of the
national legislature. The story as
told by the Neill report shows revolt
ing conditions in a number of the
packing houses and in many cases
upholds all of the stories told in the
Sinclair novel. The Neill committee
;did not consider affidavits of wit
nesses to any great extent in arriv
ing at is conclusions, but paid more
attention rather' to conditions as wit
nessed by the three members of the
committee. The message of President
Roosevelt that submitted the report
characterized the conditions found by
the investigators as "revolting" and
r.rged immediate legislation "in the
interests of health and decency." He
not only recommends the passage of
the so-called Beveridge amendment to
the agricultural appropriation bill but
threatens to destroy the foreign busi
ness of the packers should congress
fail to provide for federal inspection
of meats at all stages of preparation.
In the event of such failure, the Presi
dent says that he will 0e "compelled
to order that inspection labels and
certificates on canned products shall

not be used hereafter." Without these
labels the products will be excluded
from European markets.
One on the Professor.
Prof. Barrett Wendell, of Harvard,
lightened with an anecdote an English
lecture.
"There was a certain instructor," he
said, "who was always impressing up
on his students the need of perspicuity.
"A young man came to him one day
to get back an essay that had been
submitted.
"'A very good essay,' said the in
structor, as lie returned the paper,
'but Mr. Smith, you should - -ite al-
ways so that the most ignorant per
son can understand every word you
s:i v.'
The young man looked up anx
iously.
" 'What part of my essay was not
clear to you, professor?' he asked."
CAUSED PACKERS' PLIGHT.
Interview with Author of the Now
Famous "Jungle "—Expose of Meat
Packing Methods.
Upton Sinclair, the author of the
"Jungle" which has in reality started
the entire packing house scandal, is an
advocate of municipal slaughter
bouses. He believes that this is the
only effective solution of the problem,
although he says tha^ the Beveridge
amendment is good so far as it goes.
Interviewed recently, he said, "There
ia no doubt that this amendment will
become a law; but a few months
after its enactment it will be forgotten
and former conditions will be resumed.
I say former conditions, because the
Chicago packers have cleaned up
house and are now able to make a
show of virtue which they never pos
sessed, but it is impossible for them
to conceal the fact thai : >ey have sent
out millions of cans of 'potted chicken'
made of bob, or day-old veal, millions
of cans of roast beef made of cow
udders and gristle, and that all this
vast output has been treated with
chemicals to conceal putrefaction
and to preserve the stuff sold under a
false name.
GOVERNMENT SLAUGHTER
HOUSES IN EUROPE.
"Every slaughter house in England,
Germany, and Belgium is owned by
the government There is no chance
to graft, because the slaughter of cat
tle and the sale of meat is distinct and
separate. The government kills for
anybody, and charges so much a head.
Twelve samples are cut from each
animal and subjected to a microscopic
examination. If the meat is unhealth
ful It is condemned and destroyed.
The slaughter houses are as cleanly as
modern hospitals, and not to be com
pared in any way with the filthy
shambles we entiure here.
ANSWERING A HOWL.
"As an additional precaution against
graft, it Is provided that the loss in
cident to condemnation shall fall on
the breeder or seller of the cattle and
not to the buyer. This compels the
cattle breeder to care for his stock
in a scientific and sanitary manner.
That answers the violent protests of
the Western cattlemen, who were
forced by the beef trust to inundate
President Roosevelt with telegrams of
objection to the Beveridge bill, until
it was discovered that the making pub
lic of the Reynolds-Neill report would
work more damage to the business of
canning dyed bob veal and selling it
as chicken.
"The opposition to the bill was not
because the packers feared it would
interfere with their fraudulent prac
tices, but because it would impose up
on them a tax of $2,000,000 a year, to
pay for the inspection, which is noth
ing more or less than advertisement
for their bogus goods in foreign
countries.
MR. SINCLAIR'S SOLUTION.
"Every city in ( the United States
should have municipal slaughter
houses. All private slaughter houses
should be abolished. The result of
such a condition would be to break
the power of the packers' trust. They
would have to sell out at cost the
slaughter houses fit for the killing of
food animals, and destroy those that
are unfit. That is the only solution of
the problem, which is now recognized
as of huge importance to the people
of this country, and the only way that
public opinion can be enlightened is
to permit the commissioners appointed
by President Roosevelt to make pub
lic the full story of the horrors they
found in the head center of the great
depot of reception and distribution in
Chicago.
"The packers know that their very
life depends upon the approval of
foreign nations, and they know that
the stamp of governmental approval
abroad is regarded as the hall mark
of excellence. They know that the
millions in Europe understand official
indorsement to be an absolute and
unassailable guarantee and they re
gard official indorsement by agents of
the United States government in the
same light and with the same con
fidence."
POINTS OF BEVERIDSE MEAT
INSPECTION BILL.
Provides for rigid postmortem In
spection of all cattle, swine, sheep,
and goats killed for human consump
tion. All meats found healthful shall
be tagged, and all meat found un
healthful shall be destroyed.
All slaughterers anC packers and
all others engaged in preparation of
meat products must admit inspectors
to all parts of their establishments.
All canning, rendering, salting, and
packing products are included, and
any products treated with dyes or
deleterious chemicals or presevatives
shall be condemned.
All establishments must be main
tained in a sanitary manner, accord
ing to rules and regulations prescribed
by the Secretary of Agriculture.
After January 1, 1907, no railroad or
any other common carrier can trans
port any meat product not inspected
or passed, and no ship with such
articles on board shall be given clear
ance papers, nor can any common
carrier transport any meat product
that is prepared in an establishment
where specified sanitary conditions do
not prevail.
All canned, potted, or canvased
meat products shall be labeled as in
spected and passed and shall not be
offered for sale until so labeled.
Signals on Rural Mail-Boxes.
The Fourth Assistant Postmaster
General has issueu an order providing
that after July 1 next, rural delivery
carriers, when making their trips, will
visit and examine only those boxes for
which they have mail for delivery and
those on which the signals are dis
played to indicate that there is mail
for dispatch.
Those patrons who are now main
taining mail boxes on which there are
no signals will be required to procure
some sort of device which will serve
as a signal to carriers.
By this new arrangement it is ex
pected that the delivery and collection
of mail along rural free delivery
routes will be greatly facilitated.
In the Bank of England there are
ingots of silver that have been there
since the seventeeth century.

WHY DOES PAINT PEEL OFF
— o
Some will tell you there is no good paint any
more. Others that there are no good painters. Both
statements are incorrect. The trouble is, years ago
you could scarcely go wrong in painting, for there was
little paint used but pure white lead and oil. Nowadays
there are almost as many alleged "paints" as there
are rival dealers to sell them, and as many so-called
white leads which are not white lead, as there are pro-
prietary paints.
Yet good white lead and linseed oil paint is as
good as it ever was— and better. If you are in real
earnest about getting paint which will look well and
last— the good old kind of other days — let us tell you
about our pure white lead.
