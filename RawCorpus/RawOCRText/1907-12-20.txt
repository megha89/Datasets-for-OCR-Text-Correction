Retort Exploded.
At the Valparaiso mine last , Friday
there was witnessed the unusual 'oo
currence of a retort, containing a
large quantity of almagam,' exploding
in the process- ot purification. The
mine is being ' operated by Manuel
Garabaldi and- three others, "in 'part
nership. | It» was ■ the first ' effort - on
their part in retorting gold amalgam.
It is reported that the value ot the
■amalgam was in the neighborhood of
BllOoO— a, very nice sum, tde outfiut of
a claim by 'the interested
parties' alone. The furnace was built
in tbe open air. Those in charge had
seen tbe thing done' by others, and, it
seemed an easy matter,. '.which' they
believed they could handle with safe
ty. . Quicksilver when heated j sends
forth gases ot great explosive force.
The first thing they knew the lid was
blown to smithereens, and one-half the
'contents of the retort was scattered
over the. country.' .-.."■: Fortunately: no
one was strnck by the flying pieces or
the . melted ; metal. , ' In- spite of all
efforts to "recover, the spilled , gold,
there is bound to be considerable of
it lost. It requires a man experienc
ed in such matter to do that kind of
work. Dan Boro, who is employed -at
tbe Kennedy has beretofore 'retorted
the'gold at j the [ Valparaiso^:; but : the
boys thought they oould do/^it i also.
They were thoroughly scared by their
first venture in that-' line,' and 'will
not essay the job again in a hurry, v!
';A Serious Fall
Monday morning Miss Mary.' Demp-j
sey, grand ; treasurer of i the .Native
Daughters, fell from the second story
porch of the Frakes' home In Suttei
Creek, and broke her back just below
the shoulders. , ■ She had 'just finished
making her', toilet/ and had stepped
out on the porch to throw- the water
out. . There was .:• still j frost? on ■; the
floor, so that she slipped. There'be
ing no railing around the porch'/ she
slid off it andjto the fgAund.'^fi djsj
tanoe of more than twenty feet.' Miss
Laura Frakes went up' stairs to< call
her for ' breakfast, '. but "rieceiving"' no
resjiouae, bti»-rpada a search for her,
and found her lying; where'she'.had
fallen,' in an unconscious ..condition."
,She regained consciousness ou Tues
day, ■'. Uut was ,' suffering -great •' pain.
No hope was held out forjher recovery
at any time.' .All: the lower "part of
her body was paralized;t,*<- -V ■■■;p J ;
■Miss Dempsey has been- grand treaj
surer of the Native Daughters jEor ; the
past live years, j and 1 is^ held 'in., the
highegt esteem by everyone.,- Sbe was
a great friend of Miss Frakes, spend
ing a great part of her time, in Sutter
Creek as a guest. She was there for
the benelit of her health,' as she was
suffering from pulmonary . trouble,
and . the climate of the foothills
agreed with her much better^than
that of the coast. She was a charter
member of Minerva Parlor No.U.,

Funeral of S. W. Bright.
The funeral obsequies of Samuel
W. Bright took place on l'riday after
noon at two o'clock. Services were
held at the residence on Pitt street;
the Key. J. B. .Nicholas officiating.
The remains were not taken into the
church. Ihe Native Sons and Daugh
ters'turned out in respect for the
memory of one of the pioneers of
this section, and a large- number of
other j citizens followed the proces
sion to the Protestant cemetery where
the remains- were deposited in the
family plot. • . V
Strike Settled.
The new strike at Angels was amica
bly settled early in the week. The
mine owners conceded the claims of
the union employes, by allowing that
the nine hours' working dHy. should
commence from the time of. lowering
into, the shatt and terminate;- on
emerging from the shaft. At first the
owners insisted" upon the full ■ nine
hoi us at actual -underground .work,
TheriJiffereiice-is v about a ' quaVterrof
an hour.- '■■■■ It ", is" j general ly ~_ conceded
that the employes were ; rigfit frf their
contention, this time. Everything
will, move along smoothly in-, this
famed mining camp hereafter, and no
further hitches will occur between the
owners and ! employes. Angels (Jamp
has had its surfeit of labor troubles,
and miners and tradesmen want, a
long rest. ' ' ' , v ;,'^

Conditions at
the Fremont.
.Work at tbe Fremont-Gover mines
is stilly going on with as / much* expe
dition as possible, though' they fare
still; working, under a great -many
difficulties. Two divers were' brought
up from the city last .week to start
the pumps iv the. Gover. The water
in this shaft is above the lowest level,
which is the 'connecting drift ; with
the Fremont, so that in order to start
the draft between; the two mines as it
was originally, .. down , the Fremont
and up the Gover, it is necessary to
get the water below this bottom level:'
The pump is set on this level 'so' that
it also was under water, and the only
way to start it was to get . roen. pre
pared to go j into ' water.*- They \ buo
ceeded in starting the pump, ;. and in
fixing it so that it can now be started
from above the water. It was report
ed, that- they were going downntbe
Fremont to bring but the bodies, but
this was . not the purpose of bringing
them from the city, so, they returned
when their task was completed. The
skip. is also hoisting water, bat it
leaves the track very often on account
of the great amount of debris floating
on the water. No bad gas can be de
tected in the Gover .at apy time. J .lt
will take a number of days before the
water in the Gover " can ;be lowered
auttlciontly to allow tbe men to take
out the bulkheads in tbe lower drift.
The' fire in the " Fremont is 'supposed
toj ■ be entirely ; t out ■:: by.t this :t time,
though it is only: guess work, but by
the time that; the' bulkhead on. the
13Q0 foot level can be removed,' there
will be no danger from that source.'
Steam has : bean ' forced through
air pipes into the shaft of :i tbe Fre
mont since the fourth. These pipes
were broke by the intense heat/^ lt ?.^3
; : As soon as the Fremont can be
entered > with '•-- any r degree i/'bf * safety
from being suffocated, 'men will go
into it and bulkhead Teach drift fas
they pass it, so as to insure that' the
fire will n.ot . break .< ont j above § them
after they have gone down into the
■mine. I'be greatest care' will hare to
oe exercised for there is no telling at
what moment tbe track will give -way,
besides, the: fire , : might'- start again,'
which, would place , the . men in 'the
same fix as those that lost their lives.
From Hunting Trip.

roue'and.Chub'Ureen retained home
last Friday evening from a bunting
expedition to Coluaa county. Ihey
put .in a week roaming over the
marshes of that region in quest of
ducks, and other water fowls. Ducks
were rather "scarce, although they
managed to bag a few. lieese were
more plentiful, but they were much
harder' to capture. . From a sporting
standpoint the trip was disappoint
ing, bat the outing did the quartet a.,
world of good.
The Modesty of Women
.-Taturally makes them shrink from th«
indelicate ' questions, the obnoxious ex
aminations, and unpleasant local treat
ments, which some physicians consider
essential in the treatment of diseases of
women. • Yet,' if help can be had, it is
better to submit to this ordeal than let
the disease grow and spread. The trouble
is that so often the woman undergoes all
the annoyance and shame for nothing.

THE SAME OLD THING.
The outcome of the grand jury meeting; is h a.\ sore disap
pointment to the taxpapers generally. ',: \ \ In" ' face of revelations
of county matters which have come to light: during the past
year, it was hoped they would make some effort' to get behind
the 'curtain, and out of the beaten path of predecessors Avhich
has been traveled so anciently that it ,has become a standing
But instead of, this that body has distanced all com
petitors ,in; the unseemly haste i \yith .whicti, it got through
with its; labors/: It seems to have been actuated by the desire
to do as little as possible . for the money—anything but a
commendable spirit anywhere, and more particularly with an
official body charged with a grave public duty. I The report
is the same old song of books;. neatly, kept.'t ;6_f. the number of
patients in the hospital and prisoners in the county jail; and
molasses for every body, ;which . has become sickening by re
iteration-year after year ' v >A 1A 1 California^ judge once adminis
tered* a timely rebuke to a grand jury for presenting a report
that consisted mainly of ; taffy ta- Qounty; officials for having
attended to their work properly^ He told them a grand j ury ,'s
chief business was to find out 'anything. that was wrong and
report all cases of dereliction .of duty. '■•■■■ The law presumes"
that a.public officer will; faithfully discharge ; 'th^v, duties i' of
his office. He takes a solemn oath so to do, and he is entitled
to no special praise for doing that which ht was elected to dQ^
To slobber all over an for. having done that which, he
was under legal obligation to do smacks too much like . plac
ing public integrity at a premiun. : A;man, whether ;in pub
lic or private life, is expected to be faithful and honest ; ' that
is the rule, not the exception. When a servant of the people
departs from the rule, and betrays |the trust reposed in 1 him;
it is then he should | command the notice of a grand jury.
The reversal of -this order of things, r which .has been the
practice in Amador county for years past^ evidently under
the theory that it is more congenial to praise than to blame,
is anything but a commendable feature. The; closing send
off of the report, is good enough to repeat: v
We have had no complaints presented, nor do we
find any by inquiry that require our consideration, '■>"■
and take it as evidence of faithful a,nd cpnscientious v
work in the varied county departments. _ " V '
Doesn't that' jar you?. It would be interesting to know how
many inquiries were made in search of grounds of complaint,
and in what direction. 'Surely they must have done a whole
lot in this line, whan their, labors began and ended in one
brief afternoon. It is pleasing to note that the report does
not state that the members of the jury had heard of no com
plaints. .- -
In face of this fiasco it is difficult to say what should be
done. It was the business of the grand'j ury to know—and
doubtless some, if not all, of the members did know — that
the gravest charges of mismanagement had been circulated in
the most explicit terms. It was due to all concerned to have
a full ventilation. If the utateinents^were not sustained the
parties concerned are entitled to vindication by an official
inquiry. On the other hand, if found to be true, the people
are entitled to have the facts officially determined, and mea
sures of redress adopted for the salvation of the future.
But the whole vital subject is ignored. Even the customary
counting of the money in the treasury seems to have been
overlooked, probably on the same plane of logic as the conclu
ding sentence: No complaint being filed, we take it as con
clusive evidence that everything is o. k. We believe Amador
county will move along just as well if she is saved the in
fliction of auy more grand juries of the same do-nothing and
do-it-quick stamp for the next fifty years.
The sixteen huge battleships comprising; the backbone of
the .United .States navy, started \ from - Hampton Roads last
Monday for San Francisco, a distance of over 14,000 miles.
It is the longest voyage ever undertaken by such a formid
able fleet of war craft. They will steam at the rate of ten
miles an hour, which, if maintained continuously, would re
quire two months to complete the trip. But stoppages will
have to be made for coaling, so that if the fleet- reaches its
destination in less than three months it will do remarkably
well. It will pass through the straits of Magellan — one of
the stormiest and most dangerous passage ways in the world
—in the midsummer of the Southern Hemisphere. The
transfer of the bulk of the navy from the Atlantic to the
Pacific seaboard is pregnant with meaning. It does not spell
war, but it does mean that the Pacific coast demands the pro
tecting arm of the navy to guard against eventualities more
than the Atlantic side.

Ohio, July 17, 1836, and spent his
boyhood at the . family home, near
Johnstown, in that state. In 1860 he

Story of Lincoln.
In connection with the discussion
regarding . the omission of the motto
"In ' God We Trust" from the golden
eagles, a correspondent of the St.
Louis Post-Uispatcb is reminded of
the story told of Lincoln at the time
the greenbacks were issued during
the Civil War. It was then proposed
by the secretary of the treasury and
others ■ that \ some jjj scriptural text
should be placed on the bills, and
the president was asked for a sugges
tion. He replied, proposing "Silver
and gold have I none, . but such as I
have give I thee." It may well be
understood that this closed the dis
cussion. The story appeats to be
even more apropos of the issue of
clearing house certificates.

Beating the

LESTER CORNING
Copyright, 1907, by C. H. Sutclifte.
,'That woman is back again," snap^
ped ■ Mrs. ' Pnulding. \ Iler son smiled.
"That" woman could be } noue Qther
than ■ Mrs. Bryan, the only person in
Glendale . who dared -challenge Mrs.
Paulding's pretensions to social leader
ship. ; ' . ■ . . ,
• "They got in: last night," said Fred
mildly. ■ "They, had three weeks at the
shore, two weeks In the mountains and
a month in New York. They brought
back a lot of things from there.";" Y. >'.
''Ana where did you' get all this in
formation?" demanded Mrs. Paulding
In icy tones."
"Nancy," said Fred promptly. "I met
hsr down at the postoffice and walked
part of the way home with her." ■: :
"I, wish you would remember that I,
do not like to have you speak to that
loud person," said Mrs. Paulding fret-,
fully. "Mrs. Beeman had the audacity
to ask 'at the sewing circle the other
afternoon If ; you. were engaged to
Nancy."- \v ;; -
."■ "There, doesn't seem. to be a chance
for . such ' luck," said Fred gloomily as
he rose from the table. "Every time I
ask her she reminds me how our .re
spective mothers-iu-law would love us."
"Every time?", echoed his astonished
mother. ; "May I ask how many times
you have lowered your dignity by\ pro
posing to that impudent girl?" 1';
"About a hundred," was the easy re
sponse. "One of these days I'll catch
her off her guard and she'll say .'Yes.' ".
-."I hope I may never live to see the
day," said his mother dolefully. •;>; > r■>
"I ' hope I you do,'" he ! said. . with ' a
laugh, as he .beat arid kissed the tightly
compressed lips. "You'd like her, mum
sey, if you didn't hate her mother so."
■ Fred slipped out of the room, and his
mother ] could hear . the rumble ; of his
"NANCT AND I TrERE 5f AItHIED HAX>P AN
HOCB AGO." ■
laughter as he crossed the broad hall.
For a time she sat with compressed
lips as she_ pondered the situation. Un
til two years before she had queened
it over the Glendale set both by virtue
of her husband's business and political
importance and i because of her own
skill as an entertainer. Then the new
pulp mill had been started at the upper
dam, and Eenf ew Bryan has brought
his family to live in Glendale.
From the first the , two women had
crossed swords. ~ Mrs. Bryan, who had
humbly followed other leaders in the
city, now asserted , her j right to the
title In the small \ town, and by the
brilliancy of her entertainments she
had very nearly wrested social su
premacy from her established rival be
fore ; Mrs. J'aulding had realized what
was going on.
Her ' own entertainments became
more ambitious, and for the last year
the advantage had lain first with one
and then the other. : To have Fred fall
a victim to Nancy Bryan was the
worst blow she had sustained, and
had she known that Nancy's mother
was as furious as she at the turn af
fairs had taken she would have de
rived small comfort from that fact. In
blissful ignorance of Mrs. Bryan's
state of mind, she elected to believe It
a move of that designing woman. . :
To add to the discomfort of the situa
tion, she heard during the day that
Mrs. Bryan was to celebrate her re
turn by a garden party of unusual pre
tentiousness. '
. A number of her city friends were
to make up a house party, and there
was to be dancing on the lawn to the
music of an orchestra famous through
out the state.
In her calmer moments Mrs. Pauld
lng would have waited for revenge,
but Fred's admission of his love anger
«d her so that she lost her usual cau
tion and announced a party for the
same afternoon and evening. She en
gaged a brass band for the promenade
music and arranged for a troupe of
Arabian acrobats to perform on the
lawn.
Glendale society was shaken to Its
foundations, and as each move was
communicated to the other contestant
through the medium of officious friends
some new feature was added as an oft
set until it seemed that nothing short
of the engagement of ja \ circus could
definitely, settle the honors.'.
It .was In this frame of i mind that
Mrs. Paulding approached her son. ;
J^'Tlou I know that . ': automobile /; you
wanted,"! she began at the breakfast
table. "I'll get it for you if you can de
vise some feature that Mrs. Bryan can
not'possibly get for her party. That
woman has copied every idea I have
originated so far."
"Do you give me carte blanche?" he
demanded.'
_ "Spend as much as you like," she
murmured^ \ ■; ■
■ "And you won't ask what it is until
I spring it?" he stipulated. ; . > ■ \
;"I' promise," she said. , "I may, rely
upon you, Fred?".'
/'For the sensation "of the season," hie
assured, ! "take heart of grace, mother
mine.'- 1 am J planning to . shake Glen
dale to Its very foundations." . ,- h
Much relieved, Mrs. Paulding hurried
to confide to her dearest friends that
she would have a sensation that could
not be equaled. -. This in due course was
communicated", to j-Mrs. Bryan, L . who
'worried much; but, since Mrs.* Pauld
ing did not herself know the nature of
the • surprise, she could not | betray
Fred's plans.  . ' .- \ ',_ ■■• . •
.The. day. of the ."double header," las
Paulding Irreverently referred , to it,
dawned bright and beautiful, and l>y 2
o'clock the festivities were under way.
There j were c Ircus performances }on
both 'lawns,' and honors seemed fairly
even..; Mrs. Paulding went about with
a smile of, confidence upon her j face
and with skillful references to her sur
prise kept curiosity" up to^ pitch. The
afternoon* passed L without lthe appear
ance of the surprise; and the dusk had
gathered before Fred disappeared,' and
word was passed that he, had gone to
engineer the great event. '; An hour lat
er the Paulding butler sought' his mis
tress,'and she vanished Into the house.'
; , She, found j Fred In the library, ; and
with him was Nancy Bryan; - (v;./: ■
■ "I .want to introduce you to the sen
sation,",, said Fred, with a laugh, as he
led -the girl forward.: : "Xancy\ and I
were married half an hour ago.'.' : ' ;,'.
■■ ' "And this is ■ your* surprise ?" I she
gasped. 'v *'■'; '\.. /•'; '. /
fe"Could you have a greater one?" he
asked. "Every 'one knows of the rl
jValry between you and Mrs. Bryan.' ;' If
you. turn your party into'a wedding re
ception. you'll J beat : Mrs. ■■ Bryan '-,_ to a j
standstill. . You've been bragging about
your surprise.' You pretend you knew
It was coming, all along; and the laugh
Is on ■ Mrs. Bryan." .■\--. ■. .iK' •.'■'..
/■;;For?a ! moment Mrs. • Pauiding hesi*
tated. '.; In someways it was a bfiter

shown her. ■1 1 was ; necessary . to make
the best of the situation. ; , She stepped
forward and took the bright faced girl
In her arms. '-. [.!' 5
I "My dear," she said sincerely, "I ' am

- \ She i turned toward the door, \ but
paused as down the street there came
the sound of a marching band.- •
"What is that,", she asked— "more of
the, surprise?" V.\
.' Paulding nodded his head. ; "It's the
people from the Brj"ans coming to. con
gratulate vthe j bride!" he exclaimed.
"Mr. Bryan ! was j with us, . but >. went

,',Mrs. ' Paulding patted the curly head.
"You have kept your promise," .' she
agreed. ; "You have shaken . us ■ all ; to

on her best smile, she led the way. to

Genesis of the Hailstone.
If" it were not for the countless tril
lions of dust particles that float, sep
arately, invisible, in , the atmosphere
there could be no raindrops, snow crys
tals, or hailstones. From I a perfectly
dustless atmosphere the moisture would
descend in ceaseless : rain < without
drops. ; The ( dust particles serve 'as
nuclei about which the. vapor; gathers.
The snow crystal is the most.beauti
ful creation of the serial .moisture,
and the hailstone Is the most extraor
dinary. The heart of every hailstone
is a 1a 1 tiny speck of dust. Sucl^ a
speck, with a little moisture condensed
about It, is 'the 'germ 'from which may
be formed a hailstone capable of fell-
Ing a man or.smashing a window. But
first It must be caught up by a current
of air and carried to the level \ of the
lofty cirrus clouds, five or six or even
ten miles high. • Then, continually
growing by fresh accessions of mois
ture. It begins its long plunge to the
earth, spinning through the clouds and
flashing in the sun like a diamond -bolt
shot from a rainbow.
Still He Wouldn't Reform.
■ This curious. tale of old time spirit-
Ism is taken by Defoe from Baxter's
(1615-1091) "Historical Discourse on
Apparitions:" "There is now in Lon
don an understanding, sober, pious
man, oft one of my hearers, who has
an elder brother, a gentleman of con
siderable rank, who, having formerly
seemed pious, of late years does often
fall into the sin of drunkenness. He
often lodges. long together here In his
mother's house, and whensoever he Is
drunk and has slept himself sober
something knocks at his bed head, as if
one rapped on the wainscot When
they remove his bed it follows him.
Besides . other loud noises on. other
parts where he is, that all the house
hears, they hare often watched him
and tied his hands lest he should- do
It himself." But his 'mother declared
that she had seen his shoes under the
bed taken up and "nothing visible to
touch them." The drunken sinner re
fused in spite of these solen n warn
ings to abandon his evil ways

While attending high school -he was
very prominent in athletics^ especial
ly on the foot-ball field. During his
junior and senior, years, vhe attracted-
Ihe attention of. the" two leading uni
versities of the state, and both ' in
stitutions gave him '^inducements j for
his athletic ability. During his first

school with full : university ; recom

V Thereupon he was at 'first inclined
to enter the -university of^California,
but later changed his plans and enter
ed Leland Stanford Junior University.
During bis four years at- Stanford 'be
was very prominent, 'both in social
circles and athletics. .During his
first year at college, . he , made the
freshman team, being : a formidable
pillar at center. The teata defeated
the University /of ' California by . a
score of 25-o.' . He was a likely candi
date lor the varsity; team, but owing
to an injury which resulted in.- break
ing bis collar bone he had to retire
from athletics. for the ■ year.]i? During
hia second year, the .athletic situation
at Stanford was confronted with the
problem of who 'could fill ■ the posi
tion of center for the famous machine
that defeated the. veteran team of the
university of California by a score of
12-5..:; Coach Lanagan solved the pro
blem by intrusting £ the ..important
position to Mr Molfl no. ."Although
outweighed •60 lbs. ; by his opponent,
he played rings around the latter, and
again covered himself with l glory, i
During his last yeai at* college, I he
played in the , front : ranks iof the
victorjiouß Kugby team,' again holding
his own. It is rather singular, that
during his four years at college -this
energetic -athlete^ never ':.<•' had - the
chadce to know the; bitterqess of de
feat.; Besides ' "his • jjreat .athletic
pareer on the gridiron, he has taken
a prominent part in other kinds of
atheltics,' doing justice to bis univer
sity.. , .
In the days to come he will , be re
membered as one of the old patriotic
Stanford men, . who always came to
the rescue. of hfs . alma mater when
she was in need.
Since leaving college he has enter
ed the law office of, Cleveland L.
Dam. and .George Appell, attorneys
for the State JUuilding Trades. Coun
cil. , While in the attorneys' .office,
Mr. MolHno put everything, aside,
and devoted his whole ; time .to Jthe

and diligent J study he was able to go
before the court . of . appeals of the
third district of California. and pass

he was under, the influence of liquor

Deo. 18.— The rain of the last two
weeks is making the farmers smile
around back of their ears. v They can
now put in; their summer 'fallow as
well as plow their : winter fallow.
The rains shut off >so suddenly lat>t
spring that there was no , dry grass to
fall back on during the dry,-, summer,
and it was dry so long that every
thing was eaten up - clean, .and now
there is neither dry. nor green feed.
The green feed is j just starting up,
but the chances are that it will be so
cold that we will not have any good
pasturage until midwinter,; and stock
must be fed or suffer, and a great
many will die if not fed. " .'; . ."■ "
Madame Rumor has . it that the old
Pacific mine is going to . start up
again, ' but the people about here
have heard that story so long that it
has become the old thing, .-aucL! they
pay no more attention to the rumor.
When we see them go to work in
'earnest we will begin .to think that
there is something going to be done.
, It seems that the coroner's jury in
Mrs Boysou's case were unable to
ascertain the cause of her death. - By
tbe way, what were the doctors call
ed for if not to get their opinion as
to the cause of death, so as . to help
tbe jury make a comprehensive ver
dict. ,
(In regard to this matter we will
state that the ambiguity of the jury's
verdict is responsible for tbe differ
ence of opinion that exists on tbe
subject. • As we are informed, there
was no doubt whatever , as to the
cause of death. ' The metlical men
were a unit, so far as wb have heard
on that point. Death- was caused
from cerebral meningitis. 'If the
verdict had so stated it : would have
been incapable •of being j miscon
strued. ' But the point that could
not be determined — or rather was
not determined— was as to the cause
ot the' fatal disease. It might have
resulted from many causes, so that
the jury, as a matter of fact, even
with the expert medical testimony
before them, they were unable to say
whether or not anyone was blamable
for that death. And an autopsy
-would probably not have aided them
on this point iv the least/ We have
not read the testimony taken at the
inquast, but this is probably the dbr
"reot version. A little' more" care in
iraming -the verdict . would no doubt
have avoided the misunderstanding.

Last Saturday evening the lone
high school basketball team defeated
the team of j tbe ' Sonora high by a
score of 15~8, in a game that was full
of exciting ; plays ' from 'the very
moment the boys went on tbe floor.
At llret it :was 'proposed to hold tbe
game on the school ground, but this
was changed, -so they met in the
skating rink. Our boys are not used
to playing on wood, having played
only one game this .'season indoors,
and this was in Stockton with the
business college^ who defeated them,
thou'gh'the lone boys bad defeated
them when they played in the open,
on their own grounds. So the visitors
went into the game with a few mis
givings, though they. were, proven to
be groundless, as \is - shown ' by the
score. This was thefirst game that
tho Sonora high- played '^with"-"out

BANK OF! AMADOR COUNTY
JulitVs Chichizola, President
C. li. Culbert, Cashier ... ;.;-
Ledger & Chicago Inter-0cean, U2.5.0 'Amador County
Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises an area of
- 548 square miles. It lies on the wes
tern slope of Sierra Nevada mountains,
and embraces within its territory all
the diversity of valley, foothill, and
high mountainous lands.
s^^ljn^a^jjTJje climate of the popu
lous portions of the county is as genial
and healthful as can'be found anywhere
in California. ■ As climate is one of the
most valuable assets of : this favored
state in attracting 1 population, Amador
stands second to no county in this re
gard. Bit should, ■ and no doubt .will in
time, when its climatic advantages are
more ' thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, become a health resort not
only for . those in' less favored states,
.but for the residents of other parts of
■ California. , The temperature alone the
central' portion rarely falls below 30
degrees abrfvte zero in winter,; and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees in the sum
mer.;' Snow seldom falls in the settled
districts, arid never i remains on the
ground for more than a few hours. Of
course, in the . high* mountain regions
of eastern Amador the snowfall is very
heavy— which is characteristic of the
entire Sierra Nevada range. The sum
mer 1 season is al way accompanied .with
l cool nights; permitting, of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs are rare, cy
' clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
infrequent. '■ . , ■'■'•
. Gold Mining-. — The county, although
rich in other sources, of wealth, com
paratively untouched, -'is v noted" prin
cipally j for ' her quartz mines. The
deepest gold j mines in' America are lo
cated here.* The Kennedy mine is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
2000 feet below the surface, with every
indication that the pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. 'Since the dis
covery of gold, the county has contrib
uted fully $100,000000^ t&*;the' world's
supply of the i; precious Vmetal^ . .The
mines are still yieldAngVatfthe'rate of
about "two : million 'dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is .produced by
eight or ten mines operating on what
is called the "mother lode,'' stretching
clear across the county in tf'north-east
erly . direction ' a distance of twenty
miles. The mines '^aggregate between
400 and 500 : stamps, and furnish* em
ployment for over 1000 'miners'. This
industry is i still' in its -infancy.' The
.unexplored territory,'; even along the
main gold belt, is far in excess. of the
ground that has actually been worked
or prospected: .The county; offers to-
r dayone" of the most: inviting' fields to
be found anywhere in the world for tho
; investment of capital in the fascinating
| business of gold mining, not alone aloug
■ tbe'mother lode/b ut also in the almost
! untouched. mineralized country of the
east belt, some ten or twelve miles from
the main lode. ' v^
■ Besides gold, we .have copper, de
posits of pdttery, coal, imarbe, slate,
limestone, . granite, and. soapstono oi:
talc— all und3velop«d , ■■: . /
I; Agricultural Capabilities. — The agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The- valley lands
will produce anything that ; can : be
gi'osn in the most favored sections. I
In the foothill lands all kinds of decid
!'uous / f rnits\ thrive", also all kinds :of
vegetable are . raised , where irrigation
'is practicable along the numerous water
courses. Further up in the mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet, the
soil is . admirably, adapted , for apples
and potatoes. A ready' market for
many times the quantity now raised of
these'eommodities can be found fin the
various mining towns. ..
11 Grape pulture, and winemaking are
becoming important industries, both
tbe grapes and wine commanding a
better price than the product of the)
lowland. j
, Land is cheap compared with other I
California lands. Improved farms may i
be- secured for one-fourth the price]
current in some places. Unimproved |
lands can be bad from $o to $10 per
acre. : It does not require a fortune to
buy a small ranch.. There is room for
a large addition to our agriculural pop
ulation. .-Vast tracts 'now devoted to I
cattla-itinges might be made the homes |
oMifindreds of prosperous farmers. j
Amador has a populasion of less than >
12000. Three fourths of this is cpneen- 1
trated in a strip of three miles above J
below' the mineral belt. . . . ■
. Jackson, the county seat, has about
2500 inhabitants, and isan incorporated
"city of : the sixth class. Other towns
are Sutter.Creek, Amador City, Dry
town, Plymouth, Volcano, Pine Grove
and Oleta. lope City is the metropolis
of the valley section, a thriving town
of 1000 inhabitants. >
Tho community is law-abiding. Edu
cational facilities are excellent. A
schoolhouse is within easy reach of
nearly every family. There is one high
school, located at lone.
The assessment roll for. 1907 is $5.
800,793, and the tax rate for both state
x-andx -and- county purposes $2 on the $100.
! The Southern Pacific has a branch
railroad running to lone. From this
f| point the lone and Eastern railroad ex
tends 14 miles furihor to the mining
section.
: ,' The various religious denominations
■ and "fraternal organizations are well
represented: ' • ' '<

LETTER FROM
WASHINGTON
r^ ■.•.■"
Washington, D.C.; Dec. G, 1907.
'The sixtieth congress convened last
Monday .with the ' customary quiot
corernonies. Thero ' were ; luuuy new.
faoes'iu both bouses, so that it was
noticeable that the. prosent congress
has a . new element, whose legislative
course will be watched with interest.
As to the organization of the house,
it was at no time doubtful that Mr
Cannon would be speaker.' His emin
ent abilities aud the manner in which
be has guided trio body over which be
has so long presided practically .ex
cluded any other .choice.' , His firm
ness and conservatism will, it is be
lieved,* .bo specially/ needed during
the coming session.;, ' ;
, The .great -.questions which ', have
been discussed .by.^ members of con
gress as they arrived in Washiugtion
have been the financial situation and
the probable candidate of the repub
lican party for the presidency.
The monetary stringency being so
acute and affecting as it does, practi
cally everybody,,' was, naturally the
principal topic. ; It seemed to' be the
universal opinion that the' cause of
the ditticulitiesi- was pri
marily : the loss of confidence by the
public In financial institutions and
the great .' business .'.'corporations^
Opinions differed somewhat as to* the
cause of this loss ,of v public confid
ence, but it seemed to be conceded
that at least 'one very potent' influ
ence has been the almost constant
hammering : which has beon given
vested capital: during the past, few
years ,by writers of a 'sensational
character who ' have oarried tn* the
extreme . ideas underlying the
prosecution. by the : government of
corporations , accused" of .. '/having
violated the iaw.
■Added to this was the pretty gen
eral suspicion that the good times' of
the past six years have so stimulated
business and encouraged speculation
that obligations '■-. rjad perhaps' over
stepped the ; ability -to -'meet them.
This . still further ; weakened .confid
ence iii the financial stability 'of the
country."
•■ The effect of this lack of confidence
began to be; seriously manifested a
year ago, when -great industries faud
enterprises commenced; to experience
difficulty in securing money, for need-,
ed improvements and . extensions ;to
take care ol increasing business. '''; Ex
penditures of all kinds by these great
interests were in consequence curtail'
edj-'which further influenced I . 'the
public idea as to future prospects,
andy there came to ;} be developed : a
pi etty general loss of confidence .-im
pairing the general credit. \ : ;
"l'he mass of the people wereiu this
state pf uncertainty and tension when
the failure of a weak - concern pre
cipitated a panic,' which would not
have occurred during what wa3 one of
the most prosperous years of o:u his
tory had not the credit of nearly' all
enterprises been weakened. ."
, This loss of publia conlidaneo has
led tv that hoarding of money which
still further aggravated the difficulty,
, Without tha : prompt and 'vigorous ]
action of J., P.; Morgan and hia associ
ates, to whom later . , the secretary of
th 9 treasury leaned his aid, the-dis
aster would' havo been appalling. As
it is, the people have had time to soc
that they themselves, through v with
drawal of confidence in fundamental
ly sound institutions and enterprises,
are for tue most part to blame for the
present, situation, and that a renewal
of the old confidence is all that '■■ is
needed to bring about the old con
dition of prosperity.
. The crisis is now well passed, and
I time will bring further relief,
i tiy many members of congress it is
{held that some kind of legislation' is
I necessary to give us a more flexible
currency, ,and it is certain that such
I legislation will be discussed in both'
houses. .
Hut the ideas as to what is -needed
are, so varied aud are hold with- such
tenacity that it will be a difficult
' matter to agree upon any plan. But
| there can be no doubt that the dis
cussion will develop important data,
| and that it will be serviceable to the
[country at large. It is almost too
i much to expect that a bill of the
character indicated will bo speedily
passed. ■. ■
'- i;he ;" other '"great ~:i question— the
nomination of a candidate for presi
dent—is being debated very earnestly
in all quarters, and everywhere is
heard the question, "Is Roosevelt a
candidate?" thus apparently justify
ing Justice Brnwer's famed reference
to a game of hide and seek in which
the president takes part.
There are aspirants enougth, . but
the problem is to pink the winner.
It is regarded as certain that the bold
action of senator Foraker will weaken
the chance of secretary Taft. who, it
is now thought, may not- got the un
animous support of his own state.
Senator Foraker may be relied upon
to wage as vigorous a war as even a
I strenuous opponent may desire, and
,I as there depends on the outcome far
I more than his nomination as presi

dent or his return to the senate, . the
contest iu,.Obio will be intently
watcbed by all.who realize what bus
been the drift of affair. • !
The booms of vice-president Fair
banks, and ; speaker -Cannon are ex
tremely . healthy, though how they
will develop is what the niosti experi
enced ( politician /.^an not tell. That
there will be other booms launched
is vory /likely ''and- it is regarded as
quite certain" that: secretary of the
treasury Corteiyou will he put for-;
ward at some stage of the game. But
the; mention of the niioies of cabinet
officers for tbe high position is hard;
ly taken seriously : by those who con
sider themselves wise onpolitics, for
they simply believe that ' any cabinet
name means only the president.
. However, the situation may perhaps
clear up as time elapses, so that there'
may. be a clearer idea of '.'who's whoj'
in •■ the somewhat . exclusive society
composed of presidential candidates.'
'/_ The president's 'message at the as-J
sembling of congress contained noth
ing very startling outside of the very
remarkable recommendation that con ;
gress shall ,' make! appropriations for
the campaign [expenses ; of' the great
political parties during' presidential
year 3 .,;, This is looked upon as- an
entirely new 'departure in the, art of
self-government. ; - , : i-'- '
: ' The excellence •of the work of the
department 'of agriculture is -being
more and ' more , appreciated, parti
cularly in California, and those .of
our peope who are^ interested in the
productions of the state ate realizing
more and more fully its': importance."
Ihe^ bureau | of soils. has been actively
engaged"- in'v its particular /line ; ,of.
work on the Pacific coast,, and the
facts '. discovered ' , and suggestions
based thereon .have' been of very
great value to all producers! "'Com
mercial and agricultural organizations
are alive to the bearing "of these in
vestigations on j the -prosperity iot
California, and are on the .watch ?'for
new directions in .which- the energy
of the bureau of soils 'may bo direct
ed.:;.- .,; : ;/ -.:
, ihe Stockton chamber of commerce
has teen specially impressed with the
promptness and efficiency of the work
of the bureau iv that part of the San
Joaquin valloy.'aud has thought itself
more than justified in suggesting that
the appropriations for this service he
increased so the scope, of -the 'work
may, be eularged. It has therefore
prepared and sent to Washington a
memorial to .enngress asking that a
more liberal allowance be granted.' to
the department of ' argiculture,t- and,
particularly, to the bureau of soils.-;-
This will he presented to \ the senate
by senator Perkins, who will ask that
it be referred ' to' : tho committee on
agriculture; and will endeavor to Jse
eure on incmase in the appropriation
for the purposes mentioned. '
, ; The pinch of: the i existing money
stringency is felt in the most unex
pected places.' Apparently no, class
of people is exempt. Communications
to members of the delegation from
different parts of California show
that the holders of mining claims are
not exempt, and they are now asking
for relief. , The Loaf Angeles chamber
of mines-has, forwarded to "senator
I'eiki'ls resolutions suggesting con
greSsioaal action, waiving during the
year 1907 "and 190 a j the , provisions | cf
the mining laws requiring the perfor
manca; of assossraent work .on all
mining claims. ":
. This seems to be nec9ssary, as -.the
impossibility of raising money to
prosecute tbe prescribed work will in
many instances lay ; claims operi to
"jumpers" who would thus steal the
results of* tbe labor. 'of the original
locators. ' . ■ •. •
' During previous periods of string
ency action of this kind was taken,
and there is little doubt that congress
will now take similar action. "'A
well-known firm of: lawyers in San
Franoicso, tnoroughy conversant with
the needs of our mining population,
has propared a bill covering this
point, and has submitted it to senator
Perkins, who has introduced it in the
senate, and will work for its pasasge.
The growing coastwise commerce of
California, particularly of tbe ports
north of ■ San Francisco, demands
many improvements to navigation,
which the California delegation will
urge during the present session. The
Ferndale chamber of commerce is
early in the field with a request that
a canal be constructed to connect the
Eel river valley with Humboldt bay.
It would apparently cost comparative
ly little to cut a canal frum Eel liver
across the marsh land to Hum bolt
bay, and tbe chamber asks that an
appropriation for a survey be made
by congress. - Congressman Kngle
brigbt has the matter in hand, and
has personally examined - the route.
The delegation' will heartily co
operate and as the cost of tbe survey
will be inconsiderable^ there is little
doubt that the necessary appropria
tion will be made.
Congressman Hayes has announced
that he has prepared and will intro
duce a bill to limit Oriental immigra
tion, and that the movement will
have tbe support of the entile. con
gressional delegation from California

Peat Gas for Power.— Ancient Coin
age.—An Old Nature Fake.— Drill
Tempering ..by Electric Furnace.—
Picture . Telegraphy.— A". Sensitive
Photometer— The Modern Alchemy.
-—Wire Gauze ' for Stopping Vapor.
Just as the conversion of peat into
coke and valuable by-products seems
to have become a practical success in
Ireland, the use 'of peat for producer
gas gives promise of transforming the
moors of Germany into centers of in
dustry. .Feat taken out ie excavating;
the Macard canal is to be used first in
Dr. -N. Garb's plant for gasifiyng peat
and waste coal in a mixture ot air and
superheated steam, and it is calcu
lated tbat one ton of crude wet 'peat
will yield .66 pounds of ammonium
sulphate, worth 51.7&, and 88,250 cubic
feet of gas, suitable for driving gas
engines and capable of producing 600
horsepower: of energy. ;, Drying and
pressing the^ peat will ' be avoided,
while the production of ammonium
sulphate— valuable as a fertilizer
will ensure alone a fair return on the
outlay." Removing the peat will not
convert a fertile region into a wilder
ness, as coal mining often' does, but
stripping the barren 'moors will
change them into fine farming land.
While ancient coins and medals are
numerous, ;■« the only genuine antique
die known seems to be that found at
Tel El Athrib, Kaypt, in 1905. Prof.
C. Zenghelis ; reports ;' that this is of.
bronze, 2 inches high and six ounces
in weight, dates from 43 to 322 8.C.,
and the base is engraved with the owl
of the Athenian tetradiachma pieoes.
The alloy seems to have consisted of
about 75 per cent of copper "and' 2s of
tin. The die is : evidence i of great
metallurgical skill— the unusual pro
portion of . tin being necessary 'for
hardness, while the extreme purity of
the two' metals gave the necessary
malleability. 1 . .
Another old belief has been dis
proven—great pythons and other ser
pents in the .London Zoological Gar
den being no longer given live food,
but eating with avidity dead rabbits,
pigeons, fowls and goats. ■ , v ..:• -
'- I'he v underground electric furnace
pxomises to work quite a revolution
in mining.  As made f or. > the gold
mines of t the Kand, in South Africa,
the furnace consists of a tank lined
with heat-proof > material, with an in
terior iron crucible similarly lined,
and .tbe crucible contains neutral
salts that are instantly fused by the
ourrent and f orm ' a bath in which
metal oau be heated to a high degree.
Two electrodes on each side, con
veying monophase. current, are con
nected with a special transformer tbat
gives precise regulation of tempera
ture to any point between 750 degrees
and 1400 degrees. C. The fnrnaoe is
designed for drill sharpening, and it
offers important advantages, not least
of which, it is believed, it that of
permitting the best grades; of , steel,
which ordinary sharpening ' affects
injuriously although not acting upon
cheaper steels. There is little loss of
heat from radiation and great gain in
rapidity of working, and the appar
atus is useful for annealing as well
as hardening. The fused salt not
only does not attack the metal but it
forms a coating that resists oxidation.
In transmitting pictures by wire.
Prof. Eorn, of Munich, seems to have
been the first to achieve practical
success, but other inventors are aid
ing in bringing the art to a high
stage of development. Already Prof."
E. Uelin, a French, engineer, claims
better definition, sending tbe image
of a carbon priu't in relief. The
photograph is mounted on a rotating
cylinder, and a finger following its
contour introduces resistance into
the line circuit and thus shifts an
oscillating mirror at the receiving
end. The mirror focusses light on- a
hole 1-150 of an inch in diameter in
contact with a sensitive Him on a
second cylinder rotating synchron
ously with the first. The light is
varied in intensity by the shifting of
the mirror, and, aided by a screen of
graduated tone, gives variations on
the film corresponding to the " varia
tions in relief • of the carbon print.
The scale of tones may be reversed so
as to produce either a positive or
negative at will.
The new selenium photometer of a
German firm of instrument makers Is
claimed to indicate the candle-power
of lamps with ten times the sensitive
ness of any light, measuring device
hitherto used, while it is free from
the defects of other apparatus, and
avoids the errors due to personal
differences of estimate and the diffi
culty of rating tbe brightness of
different colors. A selenium cell is
made to oscillate so that it is alter
nately lighted by a standard lamp
and by the lamp under test. The cell
is in an electric circuit /with a milli
FRIDAY. DECEMBER 20, 19O"i
amperemeter, and; the variations in
the 'current due to differences in the
light are indicated by tbe pointer of
tbe measuring scale. When the two
illuminations are equal, no variation
of current results, the pointer re
maining stationary. , By moving one
lamp the illumination can be balanc
ed in the usual way, and the strength
of the tested lump compared with th«
standard is estimated from tbe . re
lative distances Vof the two lamps
from the photometer.
The transmutation of elements is as
eagerly sought now as in tbo time of
the ancient alchemists,and the appar
ent : decomposition of platinum by
Theodore Grosse, a German chemist,
is a new result encouraging ito the
seekers. .Potassium carbonate in a
platinum . vessel was subjected for
many hoars to an alternating current
between - platinum electrodes potas
sium nitrate being occasionally, add
ed. The platinum vessels and . the
electrodes lost weight, the electrodes
became coated with needle-shaped
crystals resembling charcoal, and the
contents of the vessel became ' chang
ed to a brown powder.' The poivder
proved to be free' from ' potassium
and carbon, while no platinum was
found in crystals or powder. ' ' \
A mask of aluminum wire to absorb
mercury vapors is the suggestion of

ing poisoning in mercury "mines,

A MERRY CHRISTMAS.
Before our next issue another Christmas festival, with its
Santa Claus, laden with gifts for the little ones — the tangible
evidences of goodwill and generous impulses — will have
passed into history. There is no reason why it should not
be a season of rejoicing and merriment to the people of Ama
dor county. The stores have made arrangements in the
bountiful supply of goods for holiday presents on a scale
never before surpassed, and the people generally are happy
and prosperous, prepared to welcome the' advent of the sea
son by shedding gladness upon all around. The little ones
are looking forward to Christmastide with joyful expectancy
ready to gratify their faculty cf
Turning to mirth all things of earth,
As childhood only can.
The Ledger extends greetings to all its readers, sincerely
wishing them a
MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR.
THIRD TERM BOOMERS.
./.. In spite of the clear statement of president Roosevelt tha
under .no circumstances will he again /become a candidate, 1
there is still a disposition in some quarters to refuse to ac
cept this 'declination as absolute. No man has 'a right . to
refuse the nomination, they claim, when the same is tendered
by the unanimous choice of the convention. And if the con
vention, after fruitless balloting should stampede to Roose
velt, these third term apologists contend that he could not do
otherwise than accept. We take no stock in this sort of talk.
We believe the president means just what he says, and would
not accept the nomination no matter in what shape it might
be tendered. The talk of forcing Roosevelt anyhow is un
wise. .His name will go down in history as one of the great
est presidents this nation has produced. He has nothing to
gain by venturing upon the untried experiment of' a third
term. The idea is repugnant to the masses of American
citizens, nor is it likely that the \ personal \ popularity of
Roosevelt would be sufficient to outweigh their scruples.
Probably no one is better aware of the public pulse on this
score^than the president himself. For the republican party
to attempt to establish a precedent inj opposition to the un
written but well-recognized anti-third-term law would simply
invite disaster. / It is the enemies of the party, and not its
friends, who are urging this, reckless course. , The most ar
dent admirers of president Roosevelt are ; not prepared to ad
mit that he is the only man possessing the requisite qualifi
cations to head the republican ticket in the coming campaign.
Democrats, who are bankrupt both in principles and voting
strengh, are the preachers of that doctrine/ They have
, nothing else to bank on except a possible blunder on the
part of their opponents. . But the republican convention is
not apt to fall into the trap of ''doing exactly the wrong
thing at the right time." \- ' : J , j " ri ,. ' .

.. Governor Gillett .is credited with favoring an, increase in
the number of bank commissioners as a -. safeguard against
a recurrence of such rottenness in banking methods as has
been brought to light by the collapse of the California safe
deposit and trust company. It may or may not be true that
three commissioners are- inadequate to keep track of the
1 standing of all the banking institutions of the state. The
policy of scattering responsibility among a larger number of
individuals- has never been found to, work well in actual
practice. ..There is no guarantee that there would not be as
many lapses with a score of commissioners as with three.
Concentration of v - responsibility as a rule secures the better
service.. . That a radical reform is necessary in the manner of
protecting the public against wildcat banking is evident, and
a good starter in that direction would be the ousting of the
present commissioners who ,have allowed the defunct bank
to fleece depositors for years under their official sanction.
The special holidays are to be discontinued after to-mor
row. The banks have recovered from the financial scare so
as to justify a return to normal business conditions. The
people too have about gotten over their temporary and per
haps needless fright, and are trotting back their hoarded
money into the customary channels of trade. Any serious run
onthe banks consequent upon the lifting of the blockade inci
dent to forced - holidays is improbable; ■'■> The volume of busi
ness throughout the country has been materially curtailed
by the stringency, and the causes contributory thereto, and
the process of getting back to the high plane of pre-panic
times will be slow. Here in Amador county business has
moved along satisfactorily throughout, almost unconscious of
the monetary stress that was raging outside. We have main
tained without effort a gold-cash basis all through.

Amador's Gold Product;
Ihe output of gold for Amador
county for IUO6 is very gratifying.
It is one of the heaviest yields for
this section of the mother lode that
we have had since early days. It is
iigureil in the bulletin just issued
from the office of the state mineral
ogist, L9wiß<§. Aubrey, at 52,260,376.
That is nearly an average o£ SIBO,OOC
per month. **We leaii all other coun
ties of the cjpartz mining class, ex
cept Nevada, and Nevada leads us by
less than $100,000. We are far ahead
of our near neighbors of the mother
lodo belt, as the following official
figures will show.
Amador - - - 52,2G0,H7G
Ualaveras - - - 1,014,234
Xl Dorado - - - 431, 74 d
Tuolumne - - - 1,039,675
So that we contributed mote than
twice as much gold as the once fam
ous Tuolumne, and over 8600,000 more
than Calaveras, which a fen years
back outstripped us in bullion pro
duction. In total mineral output, we
are still outpointed by Calaveras,
owing to the heavy yield in^copper
of that county, which last year
amounted to nearly a million dollars.
Amador at present contributes very
little in either silver or copper.
However, as a gold section it ought
to command a great deal more atten
tion from capitalists on the lookout
for profitable investment than it is
receiving at present. Uur foothills
carry the gold. There is no disput
ing that fact. And the gold bearing
quartz is proven to go much deeper
into the bowels of the earth than has
been proven at any other point in
California.

goes without. saying. The influx of

; Itiis certain that this question will
be one of = the most Important ones
coping before this -congress. But
that any • attempt by- the California
delegation to place Japanese on the
same footing ivith Chinese in the
matter of immigration, . will be: op
posed by the administration is made
certain by the president's 'announce
ment to congressmen Hayes and Kahu
that he" is decidedly opposed to auy
bill exolnding Japanese laborers. .' <
Ihe . Washfngton < "Post 1 ! regards
it as a very significant that five min
utes after the departure of the' Cali
fornia congressmen, the Japanese am
bassador ! arrived for a conference
with, the president. -Later, the an
nouncement that the ambassador bad
been recalled to Japan gave rise to
rumcrs of diplomatic difficulties on
the Japanese immigration j question,
which is complicated by the orders to
our big Beet to proceed to the Pacific.
But there is yet no authentic infor
mation as to any diplomatic difficulty
having arisen.
Ihe chamber of commerce of San
Francisco is making an effort to se
cure for the merchants of that city a
part at least of the supplies' for the
Panama canal work. Senator Perkins
placed the ' matter ■ before the ■ canal
commission and has . requested that
Sail Francisco dealers be recognized.
Lieutenant H: b\ Hodges, the general
purchasing officer, of the commission,
has stated to \ the'. senator. '.that : pur
chases of provisions^^hi'dh ithe cham
ber of commerce particularly referred
to, are made through .the purchasing
agent of the ;Pauama : Kailroad Com
pany in New York, ,who makes con
tracts covering six months. /The pre
sent contracts; willr expire in Feb
ruary, when Lieutenant Hodges .pro
mises that opx'ortuoity'will. bo -given
to San Francisco dealers to make bids
for.the ensuing, six months. ' It has
been the custom, be says, to invite
bids from all parts of .the > country,
and to award contracts in accordance
with ■ the price 1 and • quality • ot.'the
goods. At the last, letting ;of ; : con
tracts, after the bids were opened and
classified, samples were requested
from the three lowest "bidders," and
the award given to that Mine of the
three ■. bids ;, which .- seemed most ad
vantageous to the government. : . San
Francisco merchants will ■do well,
therefore, to '; give consideration v to
this matter and prepare themselves to
make bids for the^ supplies to /be ad
vertised for in February. next.
. Notification has been received by
Senator Perkins ' that - the ' dedication
at San' Diego of the monument to the
Bennington 's dead,, originally ■: fixed
for December 12th, : has been : postpon
ed, but no later date has yet been
determined upon. ■'
A vigorous effort will be made dar
ing the session to - secure \ the estab
lishment of a naval station somewhere
on San Francisco bay, and others at
San ; Diego and San : Pedro. . Such
stations ; will . become '.absolutely
necessary by reason ot the increase in
the strength of the United States fleet
in the Pacific.; That the navy depart
ment will ' recommend ', the
ment of : a station* .'can ; hardly > be
doubted, the only question being its
location.' The people of Oakalnd "are
alive to the importance of the pro
