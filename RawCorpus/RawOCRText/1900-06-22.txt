Mid Ocean, May 20, 1900. ,
Americans must traverse a thousand
leagues of sea in order to roach the
Paris Exposition, for the Trans-
Alaskan Siberian Russian Route is not
open. But in spite of the distance the
water and the expense of it, it is safe
to say there will be three times as
many Americans at the Paris Exposi
tion as there were Europeans and Asi
atics together at the Chicago Exposi
tion.- Next to the English, we Ameri
cans are the greatest travelers in the
world and since we and the English
speak tho same language and spend
more money than all the rest of the
globe-pacers of the world, the language
spreads and spreads. It is far- more
spoken and printed and read than any
other two languages. It is no longer
necessary to know French, German!
Spanish or Italian in order to travel in
those countries, though it is of course
more convenient to do so and will add
greatly to the pleasure and education
of travel. Our language is spoken in
all the leading hotels and shops of
Europe. Even the French, so imper
vious to anything that has not origi
nated in Paris, have begun in the last
ten years to learn English and are now
able to cajole and cheat us in our ver-
These reflections came to me at sea
on my fourth trip to Europe and my
second trip to a Paris World's Fair.
In 1878, twenty-two years ago in this
month of May, I sailed on a steamer,
The Swevia, of this same Hamburg
American line. The Swevia was a boat
of about 3,000 tons. This boat is 12,
000 tons. It took us then twelve days
to cross; we expect now to make the
passage in less than seven days. These
improvements are suggestive of recent
progress in ship and engine building.
Ihave crossed in four ships of this line.
Ihave a preference for these German
manned boats. Their martinet disci
pline which is seen in. the crew and in
their attendants, whether on deck, in
cabin or in the dining saloon, affords a
sense of security and protection that
one does not feel with the lax, go-as
you please management of some other
lines. It may be that if we collide with
something and our boat should start in
a vertical bee-line for tne nearest land
at the bottom, these machine-like Ger
mans would imitate the French sailors
in the recent wreck of the Bourgogne,
jump in the boats themselves and beat
off the first-class ' passengers with the
oars. But men and sailors have .been
known in deadly peril to think of others
before themselves and I believe there
is something of this Berkinhead spirit
in the seaman who man the Hamburg
boats. The danger of sinking has
" been reduced until it is no longer possi
. ble except from collision or fire, and
the dangers from these sources have
/.been minified almost out of sight by the
selection of safe ocean routes and by
fire-proof construction.
The three distinct achievements of
the twin-screw system, are increased
speed, regularity in the arrival of ves
sels, and, most important of all, a high/
degree of safety at sea. By this system
the vessel is divided into two parts en
tirely separated from each other by a
..strong steel wall or bulkhead, running
the whole length of the ship. Two
non-communicating parts having thus
been established each one is equipped'
with an engine shaft and screw, work
ing independently of and wholly un
affected by the movement of the other.
. The advantage gained by this principle
is obvious, for. a derangement of. the
engine on one side in noway affects the'
other which will continue its work with'
. but little loss of speed. . Each half of
the ship is further divided by trans
verse bulkheads into numerous water
tight compartments and a double bot
tom Insures from injury- from ' below.
.Another advantage of the twin-screw.
, Is the control held over the direction of
' .the ship. In case of accident to . the
.rudder the vessel can be accurately
; steered by driving one screw ahead and
reversing the other. We are half way
over to-day and there is no lack of sea
air. The ocean fronts everywhere.
No land breeze, and no mosquitoes.
These conditions cannot be had every
day . at Atlantic City. These boats
have* become so luxurious that many
' people sail merely for rest and recrea
. tlon. But the cost is about 320 per
day. My ticket was 8125, war revenue
tax »5, tips $5, total $135. Mr. Armour
the Chicago multi-millionaire, is aboard
and his single passage costs him 8300,
but he has a physician and a valet "and
the ralet has his wife and two children
—probably $1,000 or $1,200 out of his
pocket. He can stand it. He was
heard to say that he was living better
and more comfortably than at home,

FROM SKAGWAY.
Dr. C. ■ H. Gibbons i Hu Moved from
Junean to Skagway.
Skagway, Alaska, May 27, 1900.
Dear Ledger:
Last week we bade adieu to
Juneau and came northward a hundred
miles. The trip was delightful. All
the route was through scenery peculiar
to Alaska. , The channel is from one
half to six miles in width, and the
mountains and sea join so closely there
is not room for a clock shelf between.
The water is not blue, but black like
that down through which the Norse
man's ship reeled according to Long
fellow. , ' "
Glaciers are frequently in sight and
icebergs -are common. Haines is the
only town along the route and only
small boats stop there.
Skagway is a very different town
from Juneau. It is built on a plain
between two mountains and is about
half a mile wide and two miles long.
So flat is the land that the wharves, of
which there are four, are nearly half a
mile in length as short wharves could
not be reached by ships. The White
Pass and Yukon Railroad starts from
the eastern wharf and runs along the
base of the mountain to the upper end
of the valley, and then strikes into the
mountain. With a thoughtful mod
esty characteristic of railroads, it also
runs a lino the whole length of Broad
way and starts its passenger trains
from the foot of that street. The two
lines are about 500 feet apart. Three
years ago there was only one cabin in
Skagway. That summer the great
rush was about equally divided with
Dyea, five miles west. In 1898 a tram
way was built from Dyea over Chilcoot
Pass and' promised to take all travel
that way, but the advent of the W. P.
&~Y. R. R., changed the situation, and
to-day Dyea is nearly deserted and will
likely so remain.
Skagway is now a hustling town of
about 3000 population. It is regularly
laid out, has two daily papers, five
churches, electric plant and water
works. The railroad shops are located
here, U. S. and Canadian custom
houses, two companies of U. S. soldiers
(colored) and /is the gateway of the
Atlin, White Horse, Klondike and
Jack Wade districts, and probably a
better way to Nome than via. the
ocean route. Yesterday the money
was raised for ground for U. S. Bar
racks. A general spirit of "get there"
prevails in the place.;
The houses; are mostly one story.
There are a great many log cabins, and
the streets, yards, lots and alleys are
full of stumps and decayed logs with
here and there a tree. A popular style
of roofing is tarred paper. Many are
living in tents. Tho busy season is
just beginning as the ice has gone out
of the lakes and the rivers were report
ed open, to Dawson yesterday. The
railroad is nearly, completed to a point
just beyond White Horse Rapids where
steamers connect for Dawson. A tele
graph line runs from Skagway to
Dawson. On the' Queen's birthday an
excursion ran from here to Bennett
where a big celebration was held, one
feature of which was a baseball game
where Ska'gw.ayites worsted the Ben
netatians by a score of 16 to 14. .
Skagway is an Indian word meaning
"bad wind." The name is correct for
it uejariy always blows here, but I much
prefer it. to the. never ceasing Vain of

United BUtM Mineral Production.
The Engineering and Mining Journal
of June 9th will publish. the full tables
of mineral and metal production of the
United States in 1899 as prepared for
the Mineral Industry, Volume VIII.
This production, valued at the mines or
furnaces, amounted to 81,211,361,881,
the largest amount on record' for the
United States or any other country.
Deducting certain necessary duplica
tions,, the net value of the mineral pro
duction in 1899 was $1 , 118, 780, 830,
! against 1799,518,033 in 1898 showing an
increase last year of $319,262,797, or
39.9 per cent. This great amount came
partly from the increase in quantities
and partly from general advances in
values. The United States last year
was the greatest producer of coal, salt,
iron, copper, silver and lead \in the
world; also of many of the less import
ant metals and minerals.
The extent of our production is shown
by the figures, which include 252,115,387
short tons of coal, 13,400,735 long tons
of pig iron, 581,319,091 pounds of cop
per, 217,085 tons of lead, 129,675 tons of
zinc, 57,129,834 ounces of silver, and

A light has gone from our presence,
There Is a grave where the violets blow,
But a radiance lingers with us.
Like the sun-set's after glow.
He went forth in the morning,
A noble, ambitious boy.
With hopes and plans for the future,
This life to improve and enjoy.
Christ Jesus called him early,
Come unto my fold dear Lamb,
And Charlie answered bravely,
Dear Lord "Just as I am."
He followed in His footsteps,
Though but* child he seemed,
There was great rejoicing in Heaven,*
For one more jewel redeemed.
Though we miss him and sigh for his footsteps,
While he sleeps beneath the ground,
We have this blessed assurance.
Only his "body" was drowned.
His spirit on wings of promise,
Has only gone before,
Though a light has gone from our presence.
It shines on the other shore.

ninatratlon ot ■ Diplomatic Attltad*
In tho . "Life of Archbishop Benson"
by his sons occurs the entertaining
and extremely suggestive passage: ,
. I -shall never forget a conversation
between the embassador of a foreign
power and my father. The former was
dining at Lambeth, a genial,' intelli
gent man, very solicitous .to be thor
oughly In touch with the social life of
the country to which he had been ac
credited. ■ After dinner the embassa
dor, in fall diplomatic uniform; with a
ribbon and i stars, sitting next to my
father, said politely:
"Does your grace reside much in the
conntry?"
. My tether said that as archbishop he
wu provided with a country house and
that he was there as much as possible,
aa be preferred the country to the
town.
"Now,' does your grace go to! church
In the country?" with an air of genial
Inquiry, turning round in his chair.
"Yes, Indeed!" said my father.-. "We
have a beautiful church almost in the
park, which the village people all go
to." . .
"Yes," said the embassador medita
tively, "yes, I always go to church my
self In the country. It is a good thing
to show sympathy with religious feel
ing; it Is the one thing which combats
socialistic Ideas. I think you are very
wise, your grace, to go."
My father said that he felt as if he
and the embassador were the two au
gurs as represented in Punch, j
"I did my best," said my father, "to
persuade him that I was a Christian,
but he listened to all that I said with a
charming expression, Implying, 'We
are men of the world and understand
each other.' lam sure that he thought
that I was speaking diplomatically and
In purely conventional language, and
that if we had known each other better
I should have thrown off the mask and
avowed myself as freß a thinker as
he." '■■
BATTLE COURAGE.
In Action the Animal Nature Takes
Full Possession of Man. .
At home, In a progressive communi
ty, a man may be a coal heaver or a
bank clerk; but, whatever his station,
the environment of civilizing Influence
is strong upon him, and most of his
chances for - the j display of courage
come to the moral side of his nature.
But out in the open, with most of the
trammels cast off and the enemy In
front, | with J the ripple of the colors
about him and, more than all, the feel-
Ing that comes from companionship In
a common danger with many of his
fellows, , it Is the animal that gains su
premacy. And man, being by nature a
brave and fearless animal — the most
fearless of all the animal species—sim
ply remains true to his birthright and
goes through the ordeal In the natural
way. ■ > . • , ;• • ,
What. can be the deduction? There
Is only one.. It is that battle gallantry
and battle. brutality, springing as they,
both do from tho Eamc source, must
necessarily be allied. You cannot slip
the leash of a bloodhound and stop him
half way to his scent If any proof
were needed to make the, fact of in
herent bravery and— the other thing
certain It Is to be found in the marvel
ous change in face, manner and even
speech that comes over nearly every
man when he Is engaged In battle.
It may be urged that the excitement
of being under fire would be sufficient
reason for this callousness, but such an
explanation will not account for the
entire subversion of a man's whole life
training. The real reason is that at
such times It Is the animal nature that
takes full and* complete possession of
the human body.— Chicago Times-Her

Tie Public and Opera.
There Is a general opinion that the
stockholders support the opera, and
that the general public may consider
Itself highly privileged to be admitted
at all to the sacred precincts. As a
matter of fact, If the opera depended
for Its existence upon the support of
the stockholders, the doors of the
Metropolitan Opera House would never
be open. The bottom would drop out
of the whole enterprise. The parquet
and the galleries are the manager's
chief reliance. Opera Is not a social
function; It Is a public Institution, and
without the public's support would col
lapse like a house of cards.— Alnslee's

Why Americans 'Win.

competing In foreign markets is to be
found In the following episode which
occurred recently: An American man

iting an English firm which made sim
ilar goods. A certain article which
both firms made was under discussion.
"What Is your price on this thing?"
asked the American.
"Well, in your money, about $19,"
replied the Englishman. "What does
it cost you?"
"I'll deliver at your . door all you
want at $7 apiece," said the American.
"How In the world do you do It?"
"Well, I'll illustrate," answered the
American. "Look out of that window
and across the street. See that man
painting a sign?"
"Yes."
"He's on a ladder, isn't be?"
"Yes."
"See that other man sitting on the

"Yes."
"Now, in America we have ladders,

To Hare Good Teeth.
All persons, old and young, should
have their teeth examined once every
six months by a competent dentist.
Decay will be present and tartar form-
Injf which nothing but a thorough ex
amination will reveal. Professional
service rendered In time means high
class work, less pain and great econo
my. A tooth filled when decay Is slight
will not be sensitive, the operation not
long and the filling lasting, because the
operator has more and better structure
to work on. He is enabled to make
the walls of the cavity thicker and
stronger and with slight danger of ex
posing the nerve, the dread and fear of
all when having teeth filled. Have
your teeth attended to In time. Do not
procrastinate. Give the dentist good
tooth structure to work upon, and he
will render you excellent service. One
person In a hundred has good teeth;
09 persons In 100 could have good teeth
with the proper attention.— H. G. Vor

THB VACANT CHAIR.
When the little family circle' is broken
and we sit sadly looking upon the vacant
chair, we think of the things that perhaps
we might have done to keep the loved one
with ns. Why not think of these things
now before it is too late ? la it a kind, lov-
ing and hard-working mother who is giving
all her strength and efforts for the family
well-being and happiness ? Is it a delicate
fragile sister; or a weak and ailing wife*
Try to give her the tender care she needs.
Do not let her fade away for want of ear-
nest effort to preserve and restore her.

P. BUFFIN6TON : : : : Editor and Manager
FRIDAY JUNE 22, 1900
FOR PRESIDENT
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio.
FOR VICE-PRESIDENT
THEODORE ROOSEVELT, of New York.
The result of the Philadelphia Convention is gratifying
to every Republican in the country. A more thoroughly
harmonious National Convention has seldom been held by
any political party since the birth of the Republic. There
were some, among them Roosevelt himself, who believed he
could better serve the party by succeeding himself as Gov
ernor of the State of New York than by becoming Vice-
President, but popular will demanded that he take second
place and he will, if he lives, be the next Vice-President of
the United States. It is to be hoped that in electing his suc
cessor as Governor, nothing will -arise to endanger the Na
tional ticket. Such a thing is possible but hardly probable;
nevertheless, where there is even a shadow of danger due
caution should be taken, and no doubt will be. The ticket is
lion-like in strength and will sweep the country. The next
President and Vice-President of the United States will.un
doubtedly be William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.
f. .China is defying the whole world. When her forts
opened fire on the international fleet at Taku the gauntlet
was thrown down, at least such is the interpretation of the act
by English and German newspapers. The Chinese opened
fire unexpectedly. The casualties to the mixed force were:
Killed— British i, German 3,-Russian 1, French 1. Wound
ed—British 4, Germany, Russian 45, French f. The forts
began firing in obedience to orders from Peking, conveyed in
the personal edict of the Empress Dowager, by advice of
* Kang Vi, President of the Ministry of War. The actual news
of the situation in China was received by the United States
Navy Department in two cablegrams, the contents of which
were as follows: "The department has received a cablegram
from Admiral Remey at Cavite, dated June ißth, that informs
the . department ' that Commander Taussig cables that the
Taku forts at the mouth of the River Pel-Ho fired on the
foreign war vessels and -surrendered to the allied forces on the
morning of the 17th. The department has instructed Ad
miral Kempffto concur with the other powers in taking all
steps necessary to protect all American interests." The
British Consul at Kiu Kang has ordered all of the foreigners
to leave Ku Ling and Nau King Chang. The powers are
taking prompt action. Four thousand German troops have
* been ordered to China, 10,000 French troops are waiting to
embark at Saigon, capital of French Cochin China, and from
3000 to 5000 more Russians have beeu ordered from Port Ar
thur to Taku. That the United States will be drawn into the
trouble is, of course, a foregone conclusion as our people. and
rights in China must be protected. What the outcome may
be no man knoweth, but war seems to be the business of the
world at this time. There are many diplomats in Europe,
■ however, who do not consider that war was declared by China
when the Taku forts opened fire, and take the view that noth
ing world-wide will come of it. Clouds are gathering never
theless and the nations of the earth are evidently anticipating
serious trouble. ■
The Democratic National Convention, when it meets in
Kansas City, will, it is said, declare for bimetallism, with the
silver coinage to be fixed at 16 to i. The issuing of paper
money by banks will be opposed, and a policy for handling
the Philippines will be presented which is absolutely opposed
to the present policy of the Republicans. An independent
government for the Filipinos will be declared for. As to the
Vice-President, Bryan's running mate will perhaps be Wil
liam Astor Chanler of New York, as it is believed he would
add great strength to the ticket.
The next affair of note slated for Amador county is the
Fourth of July celebration at Sutter Creek.' From all ac
, counts, our enterprising neighbors of the other valley are
making extraordinary preparations for the celebration, and if
the plans are successfully carried out, the occasion will rank
with the best celebrations this county has had and possibly
eclipse all others. Our people will no doubt attend ia force,
THE*bugabo© about accepting the Vice-Presidency for
fear of prejudicing the candidate's chances for the presidency
is not bothering Theodore Roosevelt a little bit. John
Adams was inaugurated Vice-President in 1789 and became
President in 1797; Thomas Jefferson was Vice-President in
1797 and President in 1801; Martin Van Buren was Vice-
President in 1833 and President in 1837.

Congress Favors Irrigation
Surveys.
DOOBU THE AMOUNT ILLOWED LUST --'THR
0
Friends of Irrigation Made a Strong
:.„ and Successful Fight In
-« •.- Congress. %^'
Always alert in the interests of the
arid West, Senator Carter made an
able defense of tho item in the Sundry
Civil bill of -$250,000 for irrigation sur
veys, dyring the -closing days of Con
gress. Last year's appropriation for
this work was $50,000 and when it was
proposed to increase this amount this
year, first to $100,000 and then to $250,
000, it of course raised a ] storm of ob
jections from Senators who fail to com
prehend the vital importance of irriga
tions to the great arid region. After
strong urging by western Senators, the
$250,000. was voted by the Senate, but
unfortunately -this vims Vjufaown • by
the House to the brigtnalincreasa pro
posed of $100,000, which amount will be
expended by the Survey, during I the
coming year, on this .much needed
work. The action of the House, how
ever, shows the necessity' for the West
to stand' together, and , '■ present one
solid front and be bold and aggressive
in its demands if it is desired to get
rightful recognition from eastern Con
gressmen on these questions of supreme
importance to the arid region. ..
' 'This question is, '" said Senator Car :
ter, in the course of his remarks, "does
this appropriation go to .the acquisi
tion of information on some subject of
consequence to the people? Let us see.
A THOUSAND MILLION. ACRES.
. "There are 17 States and Territories
in the arid and semiarid region of the
United States. Those 17 States and
Territories to-day have a population of
about three million and a half. .In
those States and Territories there are
992,617,600 acres, of land".. Of that
acreage but 30 per cent has passed into
private ownership; the Government of
the United States is the owner of 70
percent. The extent to which these
lands can be reclaimed is dependent
upon tho water supply. The manner
of reclamation is dependent upon a
knowledge of the' volume of water
available. No intelligent system of de
velopment can bo prosecuted until we
know the water available for irrigation
purposes. The facts are of supreme
importance to the people living now
and to live hereafter on two-fifths of the
American continent.
SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.
J'Mr. President, while we are voting
here $65,000,000 for. various -purposes,
all of them national, all of them proper,
raising certain appropriations to i con
siderable limits, making additions for
i-iver. and harbor appropriations in . tho
aggregate of over. $12,000,000 in the
bill, and Senators from the arid regions
acquiesce in these appropriations be
cause they arc national and beneficial,
does it seem the right comprehension
of a great situation to challenge an
item in the bill intended to secure need
ed and adsolutely necessary informa
tion in order to deal with problems in
volving the very lite of the country it
self? We have reached the point in
that arid region where we can not now,
without the investment of a very large
capital, invite any large increase of im
migrants to settle upon our soil.
"Hundreds 'of ' people are passing
each and every day upon loaded • trains
over as fertile land as ever the sun
shone upon, going over the s Rocky
Mountains and off to the humid regions
ofthe Pacific coast. Why? Because
in the State of Montana where we have
146,000 square miles, people have taken
out nearly all of the water and reclaim
ed nearly all of the land that individual
effort is capable of reclaming.
NEED OF OFFICIAL SURVEYS.
"There are instances in. California
where large enterprises went in and
constructed heavy canals and subse
quently found that the water Supply
was wholly inadequate to supply the
canal. This has been discouraging to
investment in this line. What we need
with reference to this matter Is specific,
authoritative, substantial information,
vouched for by the public records of
the United States. !-*>'i
"It is said, 'Let private individuals do
it. ' According to that suggestion the
farmer living put op the Yellowstone is
to build a gauge for the benefit of
humanity, and is to determine the flow
of water that runs down j that stream
in twelve months. Why ;., not, on the
same principle, ,let sailors survey the
coasts and establish light-houses for
their own guidance? To ''suggest that
is to declare that nothing shall be done
at all.' • - .•-. :'-.. ■ v
."Are the new struggling States,
wherein the Government of tho United
States owns 70 per cent' of the soil, and
is the great land owner of the country,
to be charged with the expense ot\ ac
quiring information which is of equal
to Missouri, lowa, Nebraska, and all
the States below? 1 think npt. ft is
a Government enterprise, looking to
the creation of conditions which will
develop a superb population where
waste places n.ow exist."
EASTERN OPPOSITION.
Senator Turner of Washington whp
strongly favored the increase struck a
responsive chord, when he asserted
that some eastern Senators were prone
to antagonize measures because ap
parently they wore intended to benefit
tho West. ' ' . "

CALAVERAS COUNTY-
Chronicle: A recent crushing in
Jos. Heinsdorff 's mill of some loose
boulders gathered on the side of Cen
tral Hill channel, yielded $27 per ton.
How far these boulders journeyed with
. the tide in the southerly flow for ' the
ages passed ere a resting-p lace was
/ found, Is a matter yet to bo settled. ' ;
I The fame of the old Central Hill is
not extinguished,' but rests- for; the
revelation yet to be made of the whys
and wherefores of its escapade west
ward in the mysterious depths toward
Six Mile. A company con templates'
the purchase of the old river bed and a
bunt for the lost portion.
Progress on the DeLay tunnel is
most excellent. Several hundred feet
have yet to be run ere the May Day
lode, the terminal point, will be pierced.
Over 1200 feet of a tunnel have t been
credited to the diligent workers, and it
is to be hoped that reward will be
meted out to the company for ; the en
ergetic manner of carrying out the
great undertaking. : ' ;
At the French Union mine in Poor
man's Gulch, work is being carried on
steadily though not on a very extensive
scale, only four men being employed.
The mill is kept running about two or
three days in the week on gravel taken
from the east rim of the channel at a
depth of 1700 feet from - the mouth of
the tunnel. ■ At that point the gravel
Is about six feet in thickness' and; it is
all new ground. The gravel prospects
well and we understand the yield from
the millings is very satisfactory. The
property, which is under the superin
tendency of Frank Bernardi, Is being
worked in a careful and economical
way.
Prospect: The Ford mill started up
Tuesday forenoon, this week, crushing
rock from the mine*. The mill will be
in charge of H. C. Tyler and John Mc^
- Quig, two thoroughly experienced mill
- men and we understand that rock from
the various levels will be thoroughly
tested. The rock taken out lately has
been looking much better, and it is ex
pected that good. results will be shown.
TUOLUMNE COUNTY
' 'Independent: The stamps are. again
dropping at the Kanaka mine, and it is
to be hoped that the mine will be open
ed up and keep the mill pounding rich
ore.
The mill at the Mt. Jefferson Is run
ning day and night and no doubt that
the mine will show Its richness in the
■ clean-ups. * ■• ■ '['■:' ■ , : :'.- : ' /
The Longfellow mine put on a force of
men last Monday and work has begun
ftgain in full blast.
The Rhode Island mine is putting up
a new hoisting - works, and .will soon
commence to open up the mine in first
class shape, and no doubt the mine will
turn out all right.
New Era: The Croesus is still lying
idle though not from lack of merit on
the mine's part. All that stands in the
way of resumption is a private row
among the owners, one of whom Is re
ported so stubborn, that he won't ac

The Texai Fly.
A little fly possessed of great zeal and
a piercing bill, and unceasing activity
day and night, is just now the bane of
beast and man. This little pest is
known as the Texas fly, and this is the
first season California has been afflicted
with the nuisance. Stock dealers and
raisers say that stock is prevented
from feeding on ranges by the pest,
the cattle becoming frenzied to such a
degree that they cannot graze, and in
some instances have actually stampeded
from the range.

A Rmart Fellow.
Tuesday a brilliant chap, represent
ing an astute firm of Sacramento, ar
rived here en route to Mokelumne Hill
where he intended to transact business
with a person who has been dead about
two years. The expense of the trip is
fully $30. The shrewd firm and keen
representative could have ascertained
the facts by telephone for 50 cents and
saved $29.50. The 'young man did not
complete the journ.ey, turning back
from this point, having pumped
enough mountain air into his system to
give him the requisite business vim to
inquire about the Mokelumne Hill per
son he had made the expensive journey
to see. Now all this is'preliminary to
the real gist of the stftry. This cute
representative of a outer firm, took ex
press pains to state that a person who
would bury himself in a small town like
Jackson would know less every~year
he remained here, - and much more
nonsense of the same sort. In fact he
relieved himself, being aided and
abetted by another stranger of equal
brilliancy, of considerable worthless
wind. If he and his firm represent the
average shrewdness of the large valley
towns, give us the common sense of
common mining camps by heavy odds.

THE NATIONAL CONVENTION
McKinley and Roosevelt Are
Nominated.
A VAST ENTHQSIJISTfG REPOBLIGAN ASSEMBLAGE
William McKinley Nominated Thurs
day at Noon By Accla
mation.
The reception of delegates to the
National Republican Convention at
Philadelphia last Sunday^gave the
staid old Sunday-observing ' Quaker
City a jolt toward hades, the like of
which was never experienced before in
all its history. The oheering, horn
blowing, bomb-bursting, ear-splitting
din drowned the church bells and the
Lord's day was turned over to pande
monium and politicians. All night
long and all day Monday and up to
12:36 p. m. Tuesday the racket was
continued.
At 12:36 precisely, Tuesday, June 19,
the Convention was called to order by
Hon. M. A. Hanna, Chairman of the
National Republican Committee. At
12:53 p. m. Chairman Hanna designat
ed Hon.\E. C. Wolcott as temporary
chairman, and thus was opened, on the
forty-fourth anniversary of the day on
which General John C. Fremont was
nominated by the first Republican Con
vention, held in Music Fund Hall on
Locust street, Philadelphia, the Na
tienal Convention of 1900.
There amid memories of half a cen
tury, in the presence of men who saw
the sanguinary clouds He across the
sunrise di the party, the Republicans
met in the high tide of their glory 1 to
name their national candidate and
enunciate the platform for the coming
campaign.
The cymbals of a conquering army
never clashed ■ with more vigor than
they did there that night. Amid the
thousands of warriors there is but one
choice for leader. His face is engraved
upon banners and buttons; it is framed
in flowers and in ivy on the walls; It
adorns the windows of the shops and
looks down upon the swarming crowds
from every conspicuous place. McKin
ley again will lead the gray beards and
the young men in the November bat
tle. Banners are dipped before his por
trait and the mention of his name
arouses enthusiasm. When Senator
Foraker concluded hy peroration in
the convention on' Wednesday, a storm
wild and tempestuous, shook the great
hall.
It was not a riotous convention. There
were no wild outbursts of enthusiasm
from the frenzied partisans of rival
candidates; no entrance of delegations
with banners to set the multitudes
cheering; no fierce skirmishing and
clashing ' of candidate managers over
rules of procedure and contesting dele
gations. The chieftain in the coming
battle had already been selected by the
unanimous vote of the Republicans of
the country. The man who had stood
at the helm of the ship of State for
four years was their unbroken choice.
The platform was the record of his Ad
ministration. The only question re
maining for the convention to decide
was the Vice-Presidency, and It was
not a sufficient bone of contention to
produce the tumult which usually at
tend the assembling of a national con
vention.
Many notable groups could be seen
among the delegates. Immediately in
front sat Senator Fairbanks of Indiana
with Governor Mount of that State
just behind him. Governor Shaw of
lowa ran over to greet his executive
colleague, and say that Dolliver's flag
was still flying. Across the aisle Sen
ator Platt waited, while Cornelius N.
Bliss was earnestly assuring Mr. Payne
as to some controverted point. Mr.
Odell sat with Mr. Quigg, and all the
New Yorkers kept turning their heads
to see when that broad-brimmed som
brero made its appearance. Governor
Taylor of Kentucky came in with Gov
ernor Bradley of that State. Just
across was Senator Foraker, with his
hair tossed, looking as though he bad
been having hard conferences, while
General Grosvenor paced the aisles and
grasped hands.
Senator Allison of lowa was among
earlier arrivals. Among the other
members of the Senate on the stage
were Hawley of Connecticut, Burrows
of Michigan, Deboe of Kentucky, Cul
lom of Illinois and Shoup of Idaho.

The grand ball "given by Excelsior
Parlor, N. S. G. W., last Friday night
in honor of the delegates to the Grand
Parlor, N. D. G. W.; eclipsed anything
of the kind ever before attempted in
the county. The dancing " platform
was one hundred feet square and every
inch of space was needed to accommo
date the dancers.
Owing to the delay in finishing the
work of the Grand Parlor, the grand
march did not take place until eleven
o'clock, but it was a most superb affair
when it did materialize. Judge R. C.
Rust, Grand President of the Grand
Parlor N. S. G. W. and Mrs. Ema
Gett, Grand President of the Grand
Parlor N. D. G. W., led the brilliant
throng. Next to the leaders were C.
B. Arditto, President of Excelsior Par
lor No. 31, N. S. G. W. and Miss Daisy
V. Llttlefield, President of Ursula Par
lor No. 1, N. D. G. W., and then came
a gaily dressed multitude of ladies and
gentlemen until there was no space left
on which to turn. It was an inspiring
and pleasing sight, and one ' not often
seen In Interior towns, and probably
will not be seen here again In many
years to come, if ever. . .-.
The night ■ was ' rather cool for a
moonlight dance, but nevertheless the
attendance was large, and the dancing
continued until nearly five o'clock in
the morning, supper being served by
Ferdinand Mayer, in Love Hall, at
12:30 a. m.
Many costly gems and elegant ball
dresses were worn, especially by some
of the delegates, and the myriads of
electric lights threw ,a ' lustre on the
scene that was enchanting. The Jack
son Band furnished the music, and Mr.
Batchelder, a member of the band,
filled the difficult position of caller.
From opening to closing the ball was
a success, and reflects great credit on
those who had it in charge.

The Burglars' Terror.

"Why, you black rascal," returned
the colonel, "some of these Houston

Btwica and Hl»' Veal Cutlets.'
| Absentmlndedness was j a marked
trait In Bunsen's character, and many
amusing anecdotes are told of the diffi
culties it brought him. The statement
that he remained a bachelor because
he forgot his wedding day is of course
apocryphal, as is the other about his
putting on a suit of garments on the
top of others that he had forgotten to
take off, but the following came under
my personal observation: . . ,
Bunsen used to dine every day at a
little table reserved for him in a res
taurant connected with the hotel In
which I lived. One spring he fell into
the habit of ordering veal cutlets and
asparagus, as 'the chief item for his
meal, and without reflection or feeling
that a change of diet would be agree
able he continued to order "kalbs
cotelette and sparger daily for several
weeks until one day the kellner grave
ly informed him that asparagus was no
longer In season and could not be sup
plied.
Bunsen seemed to be immensely tak
en aback and to realize for the first
time that he had been dining on one
dish for a long period". He soon re
covered himself, however, and asked
the waiter for the bill of fare, from
which, after careful examination, he
ordered mutton chops and peas, and
this was his daily diet up to the time
I changed my hotel.— Science.
Her Pet Superstition.
It Is Inconvenient at times, to cay the
least to be the superstitious woman.
No matter how hurried she may be, she
feels obliged to take time to dispel the
hoodoo. And, as if there were not
enough signs and superstitions already
well known to keep the ordinary per
son busy, those who traveled down
town on the west side elevated train
the other morning learned of another.
Somewhere up town a woman came
Into the car and walked its full length
before she found a vacant seat At
Twenty-third street she absentminded
ly fell In line with the other shoppers
and started toward the door. She was
almost out when the thought of what
she was doing flashed Into her mind.
The idle passengers, ready to be Inter
ested In anything, were surprised to
see her right about face and start to
ward the other end of the car. She
reached the door just as the guard
closed the gate. A little verbal per
slflage ensued.
"Let me out! Let me out!" she com
manded. But the guard stood firm.
"Why didn't you get out the other
door?" he said. "I will go out the same
way I came In," she said, "with great
dignity. And down she rode, to the
next station, all on account of her pet
superstition.— New York Sun.
The Courage of Rawki.
One female bird in her first season
took 32 rabbits, 3 hares and 2 magpies,
and In the next year 210 rabbits, 2 lev
erets, 11 partridges, 4 magpies and 2
squirrels. A goshawk will go on catch-
Ing rabbit after rabbit or take five or
six birds In succession, for they do not
tire like falcons. Nothing comes amiss
to them. Hares, landrails, pheasants,
rabbits, waterfowls, ducks, rats, stoats,
weasels, mice, even a hedgehog is not
despised.
Their headlong courage Is simply as
tonishing. They will charge Into a
quickset hedge till they have to be cut
out or dive among rocks and bowl
ders. Captain Bland of Draycott, near
Stoke-on-Trent, had a goshawk which
stuck to a hare till It twice rolled head
over heels. Then the hawk flew after
It again and was shaken off, while the
hare escaped Into a flock of sheep. The
same bird, pursuing a rabbit flew right
down a large hole In the side of a
quarry and dragged the rabbit out of
it The "smash" with which a big hen
goshawk goes into an evergreen tree

How Helena Won.
"Let me tell you something funny
about the capital of Montana," chats
Victor Smith. "In 1892 the competition
rested between Helena, . Anaconda,
Butte City, Bozeman, Great Falls, Deer
Lodge and Boulder, without a decision.
In 1804 it was reduced to a match be
tween Helena and Anaconda. W. A.
Clark was for Helena. • Marcus Daly
was for Anaconda. Anaconda seemed
to have the best of It, when the genius
of Clark prevailed. He made no at
tempt at bribery. He just said to
every voter he could lay hands on:
" 'If you want a dead cinch, I'll
give it to you. Go and bet $5,000 at
even money or any odds you please
that Helena will be the capital. If you
•lose, I'll make good the $5,000. If you
win, you return my $5,000 and keep
the winnings.'
"Needless to say, Helena was chosen.
And the arrangement did not cost
Clark a cent"— Kansas City Journal.

Fish I.lvlne In Hot Water.
There is a pond at Golconda which is
fed by the waters from the hot springs.
This pond has an area of two or three
acres, and the temperature of the wa
ter is about 75 degrees, and in Some
places where the hot water bubbles up
from the bottom the temperature is al
most up to a boiling point. Recently a
discovery has been made that tills
warm lake is literally alive with carp,
some of which are more than one foot
long. All cfiorts to catch them with a
hook and line have failed, and they
will not touch the most tempting bait.
A few of them have been shot, and,
contrary to the general supposition, the
flesh was hard and palatable.

DO NOT BAND TOGETHER.
There Are \o Such Thins* aa
"Gangs" of Criminal*.
"The 'gang' Idea us applied to crim
inals is a ridiculous blunder," said an
experienced detective. "There are no
such things except in story books.
There seems to be something about the
Inner Jiature of confirmed crooks that
Forbids them to band together. Honest
folks Instinctively drift toward each
Other and form societies and combina
tions for self protection and mutual
Interest, but criminals are exactly the
reverse.
"Safe burglars generally work in
parties of three, but that is because
three men are necessary to the average
'Job'— two to manipulate the drill and
other tools and one to 'pipe' or watch
the outside. Whenever it Is , possible
for a burglar to 'turn a trick,' as they
call It single banded he is certain to
go alone. It is the same with all other
thieves.
"You read of a 'gang of pickpockets'
descending on some country fair. They
do their work in pairs, so in that case
It would simply mean that six or eight
of the crooked couples happened to
strike the placn at the same time. The
detective novel theory is that criminals
are organized Into great societies with
regular heads and cast iron laws and
bylaws, to violate j which means sud
den and mysterious death.
' "That is all rubbish. If such an or
ganization was formed, the police
would know it ten minutes after the
first meeting adjourned. One of the
things that keep thieves apart is their
horrible treachery. I have been a de
tective for over a quarter of a century,
and I never knew a single crook who
would not betray any other crook
merely to curry favor with the ofHeers.

SOLDIERS IN BATTLE.
The Peculiar Way Some Men Act
When They Are "Wounded.
If you take a dozen soldiers as like
each other as peas so far as height,
weight, strength, age, conrage and
general appearance go and wound them
all in precisely the same way, you will
find that scarcely any two of them are
affected alike.
One man on receiving a bullet in his
leg will go on fighting as if nothing
had happened. He does not know, in
fact, that he now contains a bullet.
But perhaps in two or three minutes
he will grow faint and fall.
Another man, without feeling the
slightest pain, will tremble all over,
totter and fall at once, even though
the wound is really very slight.
A third will cry out in a way to
frighten his comrades and will forget
every thing in his agony. A fourth will
grow stupid and look like an idiot
| Some soldiers wounded in the slight
est manner will have to be carried off
the field. Others, although perhaps
fatally injured, can easily walk to the
ambulance. Many die quickly from
the shock to the nervous system.
■ A very curious case Is recorded in
the surgical history of the American
civil war, In which three officers were
hit just at the same time. One had
his leg from the knee down carried
away, but he rode ten miles to the
hospital. Another lost his little finger,
and he became a raving maniac, while
a third was shot through the body
and, though he did not shed a drop of
blood externally, he dropped dead from
the shock.— New York Telegram.
Origin of the Boat.
Only lately has the original boat been
found in use and among the savages
of the south sea Islands. There the
natives take the stump of a tree whose
roots offer a good seat and, launching
this primitive craft, they paddle around
as contentedly as if there was no such
thing as a European steamer, and, to
tell the truth, they do not suspect its
existence. .
There can be no doubt whatever that
In this stump boat we have the original
method of transportation by water.
Accident certainly contributed to this
discovery.
A tired swimming savage found a log
floating near him. He grasped it and
found that it held him above water.
He mounted his log and used a floating
branch to propel the log.
It was but a step from the log to the
more comfortable root of a tree and
another step from the branch propeller
to a shaped paddle.

In this too often fatal malady.
Usually three or four applications
will be sufficient, but continue always

This simple remedy was formulated
many years ago by one of the best phy
sicians New England has ever known,
who never lost a patient by this dis
ease and won hte renown by saving
persons by simple remedies after the
best medical talent had pronounced
their cases hopeless. Personally we
know of three persons who were saved
by the remedy last winter In Boston
after their physicians had given them
up to die, and if a record was made of
all similar cases during the last six
years it would fill a good sized vol

A Savacre Publisher.

Zurich publisher and author, was a
shrewd business man, an excellent lin

the most savage publisher who .ever

memoirs of Count yon Arnim, he wrote
on the postal card with the acceptance
the proviso, "I reserve the right to cor

To an aspiring poet who had sub

postal card: "I refuse to be disgraced

Ancient Cattle and Butchering.
The earliest records of Egypt depict
a butcher cutting up an ox, exactly as
it Is done today outside of the great
slaughtering establishments, with a
knife that he sharpened upon a steel
that bung at his side and providing
cuts of meat precisely like ours.
They used leather, and they did better
tanning than we do; the blood. Instead
of being processed into fertilizing, was
used for cooking purposes, and ' our
Spanish friends never see a better bull
fight than was dally purveyed for the
delectation of those ancient "sports."
A little later in the world's history
we find records of tricks being played
In the cattle trade, for do not some
historians aver that Jacob exercised
undue Influence upon the. cows of La
ban's herds as well as upon the ewes
of his nocks? And others tell us that

course, was not known in the deal

"Are you sure she Is as gentle and
patient and amiable as she seems?"
asked the friend.
"Not quite sure," answered the young
man who is In love, "but I'm going to

"How?".
"I'm. going to get her to call some
body up over a long distance telephone
and then watch her." — Indianapolis

A little social life is good for one. As
time goes on and the. old friends have
gone to their promotion It is well to
keep up one's interest in the world of
today by cultivating friendly relations
with those about us.— Ladles' Home

It may. tn» good for us to remember,
as an English novelist tells us, that
the shade of each departed day falls on

"up at my camp near th«' Fonr
Peaks," told Jim Bark, the well known
cattleman, "the boys are ail handy
with a rifle. We've a lot of guna up
there. Moet of the new" gun* | were
bought during the Spanish war, when
we would experiment all day with tree
trunks and rough trenches, learning
the art of war at . home. We found
that a bullet from oae of the new Win
chesters, driven by smokeless powder,
was good for fonr feet and more of
pine timber and for more than an Inch
of Iron. - ■,>-,,, 1 1
. "I thought the boys bad done about
everything In the shooting line that
could be done long ago, but I was mis
taken. I sent them up a wagon. In
hauling down some firewood they
broke the bolsters all to flinders. The
bolsters hold up the wagon bed, you
know. Well, the boys figured out -all
right the rebuilding of the wood parts,
but came near being stumped on the
Iron fixings. They got some old Iron
wagon tires and cut them In proper
lengths, but hadn't a way that they
could see to punch the necessary bolt
holes. Finally , the question wa» solv
ed. Obe of the boys carefully marked
the places for the bolts, stood the piece
of tire against a tree and put a bullet,
Sfi caliber, through the tire at each
place marked. It was a novel' sort of
blacksmlthlng, but. It worked."—Ari

Garlanfl and the Tlvartnfan.
■ Cleveland's first attorney general.
Garland— a specimen of what Lincoln
called the plain people— was born In
Arkansas and "raised" in blue jeans.
One day, at the department of Justice,
he received a visit from a Virginia gen
tleman of aristocratic manner, - who
bored him horribly with talk about
"first families.". i
"It seems to me, nib," said the visit
or at last, "that there an Oyarlands In
No'th Ca'lina. I once met a ! gentle
man named Henry Gyarland, from
that state. May I ask, sub, If Jie was
a relative of yours?" ' »-^.-,- ■
"First cousin," replied Mr. Garland
shortly. "He was hanged for horse
stealing." ; '''■■:.•,
A look of ill conceived horror and dis
gust came overxthe visitor's counte
nance. Then, drawing on bis gloves, he
rose to his feet took up his hat and,,
waving a hand toward the walls of the
room, said: "A fine collection of por
traits you have here, Mr. Gyarland.
Your predecessors 'In office,- I pre
sume?" . :. .
"Yes," grunted Mr.; Garland.' The
Virginian stalked out, evidently) glad
to make his escape, and the attorney
general, turning to • his chief clerk,!
grinned and remarked: ?
"He'll never bother me any more."—
