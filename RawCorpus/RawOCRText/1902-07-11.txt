JACKSON, -AMADOU COUNTY. CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. JULY 11. 1902.
The Education of the Parrot.
To teach a parrot to talk It is never
fcecessary to place the poor bird in a
darkened room or to starve him. Com
mon sense would suggest that he
should be made as happy as possible
in his surroundings. Give him good
food— hemp, maize, oats, biscuit. As
a slice of fruit is always beneficial, a
bit of apple, of pear, of banana or of
carrot will do very well. Also see that
your pet has pure drinking water, a
large cage, some soft wood to gnaw,
with plenty of coarse grit on the floor
of tbe cage, for he needs the small
stones to aid hie digestion. A parrot in
th«se comfortable circumstances may
then be left alone in a room while his
teacher conceals himself in another.
The teacher, who should be heard, but
not seen, should repeat, wltb infinite
patience, over and over again the word
or words he wishes his pet to learn.
The female parrots do not talk— the fe
male of the song birds, it should be re
membered, is not a singer— so that ef
fortE of education in that line are Quite
throvn away.— Our Animal Friend*.
Cicero.
Cardinal Newman was a muter in
the art of writing English. In one of
hie published letters be expressed the
following 1 opinion: '
- "As to patterns for imitation, the only
master of style I ever had is Cicero. I
think I owe a great deal to him and, co
far as I know, to no one else."
Bishop Wordsworth of St Andrews,
another masterly writer of English,
says in his autobiography : <■
"So far as I have derived benefit
from any one In the matter of compo
sition it has been from Cicero. I do
not underrate tbe advantage of a com
bined study of authors such as Addl
eon, : Swift, Bolingbroke, • Johnson,
Burke, Hume, Gibbon, Macaulay and,
I may add, Horace Walpole, but I
must repeat that I believe I got more
good, not only in writing Latin, but
for writing English, from reading
Cicero and learning him by heart than
from any other source."

Lack of Clothing- In T trondn.
A lack of clothing was and probably
etill is tbe most salient characteristic
of the Wa-Kavlrondo. "I am afraid

missionary to me on tho borders of
their country, and so we-did; nothing
could have been uakeder. From their
walled villages they issued in swarms
and crowded round the tents t{> gaze
upon us, monsieur, madame and bebe.
without a rag to their names nor a
clout between them, unless indeed' a
bead necklace or a hippopotamus tooth
Etuck behind tbe par could be account
ed clothing. An airy, buoyant folk,
verily, and to missionary eyes a cad
contrast to the semicivlllzed Waganda,
with their greasy draperies of bark
cloth.-Cornbill.
Mcdagascar'4 Tiro Climates.
The island of Madagascar has two
distinct climates, two classes of natives
and two classes of fauna and flora.
The island is about tbe size of France.
Along the coast it Is tropical and ma

tableland and mountainous. There the
climate Is cooler and tbe natives small

coast. But in the Interior they aw

HcSwlney's Gin.
Near Horn Head, County Donegal,
Ireland, there is a bole in the rocks
called McSwlney's gun. It Is on tbe
eeacoast and Is said to have connection
with a cavern. When the north wind
blows and tbe sea Is at half flood, tbe
wind and the waves enter the cavern
and tend up jets of water from the
"gun" to a height of more- than 100
feet. The jets of water «r* accom

heard for miles.

JACKSON ....... CAU
RICE WATER NUTRITIOUS.
Cartons War Some- British Ofleers
•Dlscorered This Fact.* ;
"It is probable ' that few occidental
cooks who prepare rice in various
forms for diet are aware that in dis
carding the water in which it is boiled
they are wasting what is regarded- by
the oriental as the most nutritious part
of the food. This fact was curiously
proved some years since when a de
tachment of Europeans and > native
troops in India found th'emselvea be
leaguered In a fort with Insufficient ra
tions, even of rice, to enable them to
hold out until a force could march to
their relief.
It was when tbe officers wero eerl
ously debating this problem tbat the
natives approached them with what
was regarded &s a curious solution of
the difficulty. If, proposed the latter,
the Europeans took all the rice, they,
the natives, would be quite content
with the water in which it was boiled.
The suggestion. In place of any better,
was adopted, when it- was remarked
tbat while the Europeans found it dif
ficult to maintain their strength on full
rations of rice the natives lost none of
their stamina by several weeks' diet on
the water. When the proposal was
made, the action of the natives was
praised as one of great devotion to
their superiors, but the sentiment was
somewhat mollified when the discov
ery wa6 made that the natives were
quite aware that the principal nourish
ment lay in the water.
Since that time Europeans in tbe ori
ent, following the custom of the na
tives, have given rice water to pa
tients, particularly In cases of cholera,
as a last resort when no other food can
be retained in tbe stomach and usually
with good results. But the natives al
ways value this water so highly that it
Is never thrown awoy.
In fact, It would surprise many cooks
to discover how much may bo done
with this apparently worthless stock.
If the rice is cooked In the oriental
fashion— that Js, boiled only so long
that each grain comes out of the pan
separate and not as a sodden mass—
the water wheu strained off and per
mitted to cool will become a jelly ap
proaching the consistency of
mange. To suit the occidental 'palate
the water should be flavored with an
extract or otherwise the jelly may
have rather an insipid taste.
Skrcp In Varied Clothing.
One of the results of the investiga
tion of a special committee of the So
ciety of Arts Into tbe question of.book
bindiuß goes to show that sheepskin
Is often used by bookbinders under
very different names. They found
books bound nominally in Levant mo
rocco, hard graiu morocco, straight,
grain morocco, pigskiu, calfskin, croco
dile aud alligator leathers, all of which
on close microscopic examination were
found to be th« ordinary common
aheep&klu on which, had been stumped
thejspecial grains and markings of tbe
skins they were got up to imitate. The
committee, ! however, were satisfied
that in many cases botb tbe book
binders and the librarians bad bought
these leathers under the Impression
that they were buying the genuine ar
ticle. — London Globe.
Hott Rniiilas Peasants Live.
Most of the Russian peasants pass a
great deal of their lives In workshops,
where they work, eat and sleep, tbe
6ame room sheltering a number and
probably a pig in the bargain. There
are few beds. Instead, all around the
four walls of the room is fixed what
may be literally described as a bench.
It Is made of wood, and at this works
the peasant by day, and on it he sleeps
by night, each man at his own spot
The conditions of the Russian work
shop or factory and the Russian prison
and military barracks, so far as In
terior arrangements are concerned, are
akin. ' Chairs there will also be and a
table, rudely fashioned, as a. rule, by
the' men ■ themselves.— Saturday ' Re

Twentieth Century Medicine.
The twentieth century has almost a
free field in medicine. Although much
has been accomplished in the treatment
of dleeascs, the science Is still largely
experimental,' and there is room for a
host. of. discoveries. . Perhaps by the
time this century is ended there will be
a lymph or an antitoxin or some sort
pf treatment for every ill the flepu ia
heir to, so that a few . vaccinations and
other treatments will guarantee immu
nity for a long period. Then centena
rians will ho as common as blackber

TRE ; SIERRA EXTENSION.
It W'll Be Completed to Aogeli in s
Month.
Work on the Sierra Railway Com
pany's branch line to Augels Camp
is progressing rapidly! Last week
the .Antjels Record published the
follctviug 'information concerning
the read:
"At present tbe rails are laid to
Carscn Hill, andin6tde of one mouth
tht> company will be hauling freight
here."
'iT..S.' Bullock, in company with
Chief Engineer Newell, were in
town, this week, aqd informed the
Record that arrangements will be
made i to build the road to the Ghost
aiine; at which point they will land
all. frMght;"- pending the finishing of
tb&.3it tWrotigh tie hill at that point
to the grounds selected for the
station and freght yards. The cut
to be made there is the heaviest on
the line, as it will necessitate the re
moval of about 6000 yards of dirt
aud rock, and will take about two
mouths to complete it.
''It is tho intention of the Sierra
company to run their trains here so
that a great deal of v the Yoseniite
Valley travel will come this way en
route to the Big Trees aud tbe Mur
phys cave. They estimate that dur
inp the next scasou from 1500 to
2000 visitors will be sent through
town, the trip from here to the
other points being made by stage.
Thi* will mean that Angels will reap
a groat beuufit from this travel, and
that the visitors will also learu what
Angels has to offer in the way of in
vestment in mines. It will adver
vise this town to the whole world
aud do a ifrcut e'eal of £ood.
"The Sierra company is having
two new coaches and a combination
coach and smoker built especially
for travel between here and Stock
ton. Tbe coaches will _be of tfie
latest pattern, with double windows,
so that they will virtually be obbor
vatiou cars. This mute is conceded
to be one of iht" sei-uie-' roads of the

travel.
"Messrs. iiulluck anuNewell weut

the former jreDtlenian will take a
couple. of weeks rest. It is quite
likely that the ■ Biy Trees hotel will
be taken charge of by the Sierra
company after tliisscason^ being run.
in conjunction with the road."
Don't Be a Knockar.
A Sacramento mercantile firm has
the following primed on the reverse
side of its business cards:
"If there is any chance to boom busi
ness, boom It. Don't be a knocker.
Don't pull a long face and get sour in
your stomach. Hope a bit. Gut a
6mile on you.. Hold up your head.
Get a hold with both hands. Tbeu
pull. Bury your hatchet. Drop your
tomahawk. Hlde-your little hammer.
When'a stranger drops in tell him this
is tho greatest town on earth. It is.
Don't ' get mulish. Don't roast. Be
jolly. Get popular. It's dead easy.
Help -your sslf along. Push your
frlonds with you; Sooq you will have
a whole procession. Be a good fellow.
"No man ever helped himself by
knocking other people down. No man
ever got rich trying to make people
believe he w&s the only good on earth.
You can't ollmb the ladder of fame by
stepping on other peoplo's corns.
They're tholr corns.' Not yours. And
they're tonder. Keep off the corns.
"All men are not alike. Ouco In a
while you may find one who 'is very
much alike. But borne uro different.
You're not the only shift in the <vttbh.
If you don't like their style, lot 'em
alone. Don't knock. You'll. get used
to It. There's no oud of ~ fun in uilud-
Ing your own business. And it. makes
other people like you better. Better
have others etude on you than get
stuck ou yourself. Nobody gets stuck
on a knocker. Don't be one, or two.
Bo gooii, and If you would succeed,
don't bo a knocker."

The Forarotten Dot.
A wedding took place a short time
back In- a large town in the north of
England, the service being conducted
by a rather eccentric vicar. Two days
after the ceremony be called at the
bouse of the bridegroom's mother^ but'
she happened to be out, so he said h»
would call again, which he did later on
in tbe day, carrying two large green
bags nnder his arm. --■:•;
This time he found her in. So he be
gnu by asking them to clear the table
a little. Then' he' opened the green

The Checltretn.
The overcheck bears about the same
relation to the horse as the county jail
does to human society. . In case of the
trotting horse it seems tbat some de
vice must be used in order to compel
a horse to carry Its head out almost in
a line .with its neck, so that the curv
ature of the latter at the throttle will
not cramp the windpipe or shut off
the horse's wind. In case of the run
ning horse it naturally extends the
head and neck without artificial aid.
This is because^the gallop Is the horse's
natural gate, while the trot is artificial
when it comes to extreme speed.
Hence the overcheck is needed." In the
utility horses the checkreln is never
needed.— Field and Farm. ■
The Greenland Shark.
The Greenland shark is well known
as a foe to whalers. It will follow a
dead whale to the ship and Bhow'no
fear of the men while they are engaged
In cutting up the prey, biting out lumps
from it as big as a man's head. Some
times it happens that a man will fall
off tbe slippery side of tbe whale close
by the shark, but the latter never at
tacks him, being intent upon gorging
Itself with the flesh of the cetacean.
The most severe wounds from thrusts
ef the whalers' knives will not per
suade it to desist This species of shark
Is often partly or wholly blinded by a
parasitic worm three Inches long which
fastens itself at the corner of the eye
and lives on its fluids.
Right Dolnff.
One's rightful work is often halted
by fear of what others will 6ay about
it. This may be e^eu more a' barrier
to tho work than tbe feaft>f not doing
the work at all." It takes courage to
do what we believe we ought to do,
when we think we shall be criticised
or misunderstood or scorned. But the
real calamity, lies in not doing what
we ought. Of this it Is well to have
so strong a- fear that we shall have
courage to face whatever others may
sar of our right doing.

R. WEBB ■ ■ . Editor and Manager
FRIDAY JULY 11, 1902
FOR THE OFFICES.
The time is approaching when
county officials— those who hold the
offices in connection with
"the county government — will be re
• quired io give an account of their
• stewardship. The .sovereign people
■ who elected them lo positions of
: trust will scrutinize the record of
.each servant, and if need be call
back the delegated authority, and
place the same in other hands. It
can be taken for granted that every
.county official is anxious to succeed
himself. It matters not how long a
. man has been in office, he is never
satiated. There is something about
the business of office holding, that
when the average man is fairly em
barked therein he is rarely willing
-to let go. He becomes fascinated
• with place and power, and too often
~hugs the delusion that the people
are also infatuated^ with him. When
■_ election time comes round he makes
• the plea that if the dear people
whom he has, from his own interest
ed standpoint, served so faithfully,
will only give him one more term,
he will be satisfied, and give some
other good man a chance. But just
as sure as election time rolls round
again, the chronic fever asserts
itself as strong as ever, and he
wants "'one more- term." The
truth is he wants a life-long lease.
The love of power dominates every
other passion, and absolutely dic
tates the individual's life. The
longer this appetite is gratified, the
more imperious and domineering it
becomes. It is a wise arrangement,
under a republican form of govern
ment, that at stated intervals, the
power returns again to the people of
either reelecting their public ser
vants, .or relegating them to the
ranks of private life. The con
sciousness of this reserve power
tends to exert a salutary influence
upon official conduct. It ought to
put the office-holder on his best
behavior. When by long-continuance
in public life, or from whatever
cause, this wholesome influence be
comes relaxed, the people may de
pend upon it that a change is de
sirable. The time has come when it
is their duty to themselves and to
■ their country, to move for a read
justment of the political machinery.
We are not now speaking from a
party standpoint. The Ledger is
republican, and its editor is a repub
lican of the stalwart kind. We are
not hide-bound in our partisanship.
We do not believe that it is for the
best interests of our county to have
all the offices filled by republicans
all the time. As an individual and
as a journalist, we have sometimes
deemed it our duty to aid in defeat
ing nominees of bur own party.
Whenever we have pursued this
path of divergence, we have done so
regretfully, moved mainly by a de
sire for the public weal. Selfish
motives may also come into play.
Human nature is a curious mixture
of good and bad. No man is moved
solely and absolutely by noble in
spirations. There is ever present a
strain of clay that interferes more
or less with the ring of the true
metal. While this is true as a
psychological fact, it does not de
tract in the least from the value of
any act the mainspring of which is a
desire for the public weal. We must
take human nature as it is, not as
our ideality has pictured it. v
We deem it not out of place at this
early period of the campaign, to call
attention to an anomalous feature in"
connection with our county gov
ernment. The anomaly is probably
matched by no other county in Cali
fornia. We refer to the fact that
the entire judiciary and executive
branch of the county government is
in the hands of the adherents of one
party — the democrats. To be more
explicit, the superior judge, the
'sheriff, the district attorney and the
county clerk are all in the hands of
democrats. Let the voters ponder
over this fact, and the further fact
that when most of these officials
were last elected four years ago, the
county was republican. Find if you
can a parallel to this peculiar condi
tion of , affairs in any other county iin
the state. We ask the voters to
discuss among themselves the causes
which brought about this anomaly.
Let them analyze the political drift
for the past eight years, and they
will probably find that the evil
herein complained of has been
created in a measure by the very
desire to prevent the concentration
of power in the hands of a few of the
same party, or of members of differ
ent political organizations acting in
concert for mutual benefit. Have
we,' in trying to correct one wrong,
conjured up a greater? Ga no sub
ject within the range of our local
government are tbe citizens, inde
pendent of their party affiliation, so
jealously alert as the formation; of
governing cliques, whether, confined
to one or more political organization.
They will smite a combination form
ed to perpetuate individuals in
power every time they get a chance
at the ballot box. No doubt we
shall hear much about the official
records that have been made; some
will refuse to see anything that calls
for change- in the situation as \we
have presented it. The voters, how
ever, will, we trust, give just about
the weight to these t and other state
ments of a more radical character,
that tbey-are en titled to. A change
is in order, and it is for the repub
lican party to present a ticket that
will justify citizens in accomplishing
the needed change. . - . • 2
Mare it a point to get registered.
See that your friends and neighbors
are also registered. Don't leave it
till the last moment. Every citizen
in Amador county will want to take
a hand in the uomiug election. The
man that loses his vote by neglect
will be inclined to kick .himself for
his folly. ••••'-. -
We know not what conditions ex
ist in other state . institutions on
account of Governor Gage's appoint
ments, but we do know that the
Preston reform school, under super
intendent Reddick. runs smoothly
and efficiently, without the slightest
intimation of wroDg-doing. Under
D. H. Hirschberg's regime, under
Budd's administration, there were
constant complaints of bad manage
ment and discontent! Since Red
dick has assumed control under
Gage's appointment, the school is
looked upon as one of the best con
ducted institutions of the kind to be
found in the United States.
In order to set at rest misleading
reports which are in circulation, we
are authorized to state that Hon.
Fred L. Stewart will not be a candi
date for either district attorney or
the assembly. The assembly dis
trict of which Amador county now
forms the smallest part, was not
constituted as it now stands without
his persistent opposition. He op
posed this unjust apportionment in
every way, and only when his views
were overwhelmed in caucus did he
cease opposition; and even then ex
plaiued his position and had the ex
planation spread upon the assembly
journal. Mr. Stewart will serve the
republican cause if it is so desired,
by taking the nomination for superior
judge, for which office he is emi
nently qualified. < In this connection
we are free to say that the editor of
the Ledger has made no special ef
forts to bring about this situation.
As a republican we desire that a
suitable candidate be found to con
test for every office within the peo
ple's gift. Let those who want to
hug the idea that some office-holders
of long standing ought to be left in
undisturbed possession of their fat
berths. We refuse to acknowledge
any such claim, and believe that
there is just as good — we might use
a stronger term— material within
the republicau ranks for every
position now occupied by the tniuor
ity party. In common with
other republicans— and only in
concert with them — we have exerted
ourself to the end that uo office
shall be permitted to go by default.
We have no apologies to make for
this course. In years past we have
refused to sanction the placing on
the republican ticket of a candidate
for superior judge whom we could
not indorse as suitable for the place.
But when a man appears who meets
the requirements of the office in
every respect, we propose to give
him our cordial support, and earnest
ly recommend him as worthy of the
support of every republican.
ASSESSMENT ROLL.
A Blight Decrease From the Figures of
Last Tear.
The assessment roll of Amador coun
ty for the year 1002 is completed, and
has been turned over to the board of
supervisors. Assessor Merchant has
kindly furnished us with the following
figures, showing the total values for
'the current year:
Real estate, other than town
lots $2,250,572
Improvements on real estate. 642,745
Value of tow.n lots 269,380
Improvements on same 722, 800
Personal property . • . ; 590,408
Value of mortgages 403, 463
Money on hand J9.300
There has been collected by tbe as
sessor on personal property unsecured
by real estate, the sum of $2943.36.
The assessed value of property in the
respective townships for the years 1901
and 1902 is presented herewith for
purpose of comparison:
1901 1902
Township 1 1 , 610, 01 7 1, 540, 954
Township 2 1,027,655 1,005,182
Township 3 402,944 387,798
Township 4 937,575 - 970,998
Township 5 577, 253 590, 273
Totals $4,555,444 $4,495,205
The figures for the present year are
subject to slight changes, but they may
be taken as substantially correct. They
§how a decline of property value in the
county as compared with last year of
$60,239. This falling off is In town
ships one, two and three. In township
one the reduction is wholly accounted
for in the reduced valuation of the
Oneida mine. A year ago the mine
was running 60 stamps, whereas only
40 are kept in motion today, necessi
tating a sweeping reduction In the as
sessment.
In township two the falling off is ac
counted for by the transfer of 1000
bead ol cattle to Sacramento county,
that were assessed in this county last
year, and also tbe double assessment of
a mortgage of $10,000 last'yfiav.
Townships 4 and 5 show substantial
gains, owing to tho development of the
mining industry around Amador City
and Plomoutfe,

LANCHA PLANA SENSATION
A Chapter of Violence Shakes the Little
Burg.-J. B. BUekman the Victim
_ : . .of a Benous Assault.
The small village of Lancba Plana
has been convulsed within tbe past
few week 6by a series of misdoings,
which have rent the little population
Into two angry faction*. The story is
a strange one, and while the facts have
not drifted far beyond the border
town, they are of sufficient Importance
to demand notice In print. Mrs. Black
man, who has been a resident of that
place for nearly twenty years, was In
Jackson Monday, Interviewing the
officials, and gave the story of her
trials'. If one tithe of her statement is
true — and we havo no reason to doubt
any part of H— lt shows a state of
society in the hamlet of Lancha which
Is deplorable In the extreme. ■..
. It appears that some "' months ago a
gravel claim known as tho Sheridan
mine was started up by hydraulic
power. It is a rich claim, and as far
as worked paid well. But the law re
quires that no mine can be operated by
hydraulic process without first obtain
ing a permit from the debris commis
sioner. Mr. Black man spoke to the
operators,. Messrs. Sheridan and Ad
ams about tbe 'matter in a spirit of
friendliness, soit is claimed. The over
tures were disregarded, and thereupon
Mr. B'.ackman notified tbe commis
sioners of the fact. Shortly thereafter
notices were sent up by the commis
sioners, setting forth what owners of
hydraulic mines "were required to do
before ooinmencing operations'. Five
of these notices were posted up by Mr.
Blackmail, and were torn down.
Thereafter the commissioners took a
hand in* the - game, -and the hydraulic
operations were stopped, until a permit
could be applied for and granted in
compliance .with. law. There was no
reason why permission could not be
obtained, after some simple precau
tionary measures had been taken. The
owners, we understand, have since se
cured a license to operate, but work
has not yet recommenced.
On the 14th of June a social dance
was given In Lancha Plana. The
hotel Is owned by Mrs. Blackman but
rented to Mr. Ruhl, under restrictions
concerning the salo of intoxicating
liquors. On the evening In question,
some of the guests managed to get
liquor and became boisterous and quar
relsome. Blackman was seated In front
of the hotel . about ten o'clock, and a
Eersonal encounter occurred between
im and James Crail and Wilson Crail.
Blackman was severely beaten and In
jured. He had a small cane in his
hand, and this he used to defend him
self as best he could. He has been
confined to his bed ever since. He was
In feeble health before the assault, and
was only able to' get around a short
time before this occurred. Dr. Marsh
has attended him, and the case was of
such gravity that Dr. Adams was also
called in consultation. The Cralls
were arrested on a charge of battery
preferred by Mrs. Blackman, and were
taken before Justice McCauley, who
held them under bonds of 350 each.
The trial was sent for June 28, but at
tbat time Blackman was still unable to
be present, and tbe case was postponed
Indefinitely. A charge of using threat
ening language was also preferred
against Wilson Crail, the object being
to have him bound over to keep the
peace. The matter was heard before
Judge McCauley last week, with the
result that tbe testimony was deemed
Insufficient to hold the accused, and he
was discharged. . • rs

Deafness Cannot be Cured
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear.
There is only one way to cure deafness,
and that la by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous lining of tbe Eus
tachianTube. When this tube is In
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it Is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can' be
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of tbe
mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars
for any case of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot be oured by Hall*
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free.

The B. V. C. M. &R. Co. has gone

sight, and the wtiol» thing collapsed.
The operators of the gravel claim
have made two clean-ups, but refuse to

TREr. TILE BEATS GUS RECORD
Was Much Lighter, But Put Jackson
-Han to Sleep in Three Bounds.
• Jitu- Tremble, who defeated l)av«
Barry a week ago at tho Old Pavillion,
added another victory to his record by
defeating Gus Record", a heavyweight,
in three rounds at Jackson Thursday
night. • Tremble was at least twenty
pounds lighter than Record. The lat
ter has- had several contests around
Jackson, and was never defeated until
he met Tremble. The sporting men at
Jackson stated it was the best contest
ever seen there, and are trying to se
curo some good man to meet Tremble.
We take the above, headlines and
all, from the Record -Union of Friday
last.. Those who were present at the
boxing entertainment in Jackson will
smile upon reading such a distorted and
absurd ivrvr ;. evidently given by the
boxers from the capital city who took
part in tbe affair. The fact is the
Tremble-Record affair, was simply to
fill up the time. The difference in
weight was in 'favor of Tremble. - It
was never intended for anything more
than an exhibition of skill, and the
local man know, as every one' else
knew, that he was no match for the
outsider. There was no knock-out,
and it was never intended there should
be one. It serves to show what ab
surdly exaggerated stories are cir
culated sometimes for effect.

A case of smallpox was discovered at
the Central hotel last Sunday. The
victim is a man named James Fleming.
He had been in Jackson only a few
days. Hp had been working at Carter",
in Tuolumne county, and oa leaving
there wont to Stockton. It is supposed
that he contracted the disease in that
city. He had been complaining for
several days, but Sunday the well
known pustules of smallpox were plain
ly marked, and thereupon he was .re
moved to the Kelly place, a mile or so
north-east of town. It in a mild case.
The delivery team of W. E. Kent,
driven by Willie Nettle, ran away last
Monday afternoon on Broadway.
Eunice Going, a girl of eleven years,
was also in the wagon. The Jrjver lost
control of the team, and was unable to
keop them in the middle of the road.
Consequently the wagon collided with
great force against one of the telephone
poles, a deep Indentation in the pole
appearing where the wagon tire struck.
Nettle was throwu out with great
violence, the girl being thrown in
another direction. The latter escaped
injury. Nettle was badly shaken up.
He was carried to his home and medi
cal aid summoned. It was at first
feared that the spinal column was in
jured. This, however, proved incor
rect. Beyond a severe shock, no seri
ous injuries were sustained, and he is
expected to be around again shortly.
George Ellis, the cattleman, while
en route from his mountain raoge on
Tuesday last, was thrown from his
spring wagon, and severely injured
about the head. The accident hap
pened in the neighborhood of Tragedy
Springs, and he lay on the road help
less for five hours, until one Ferrari
found him, and attended to him as best
he could, and he proceeded to Wiley's
station, where he remained until yes
terday, on which day he came on to
Jackson, and had his wounds dressed
by Dr. Gall. An ugly gash in the head
was the principal injury. He remain
ed in Jackson last night, and to-day
proceeded to bis home in the valley.
The mishap was caused by dropping
one of the lines, which frightened one
of the horses, and resulted in running
against a log, overturning the wagon,
throwing him out and pinning him in
a way that he could not extricate
himself,
THE AMADOR LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, JULY 11, 1902.
THE FOURTH AT JACKSON
Not Allowed to Pasß Un-
observed.
Literary. Exercises, Foot Races, Don-
key Eaces, Barrel Races, etc.,
and Dance at Night.
The time-honored fourth of July
was not permitted to pass in Amador
county without some recognition, and
to Jackson must be accorded the honor
of redeeming this holiday of holiday*
from utter neglect. It would have ap
peared incongruous to have celebrated
the 9th. of September— the anniversary
of the admission of California into the
Union — with great pomp and cere-
mony, and allowed the day of days
cherished and honored by the Ameri
can people— the nation's birthday— to
have passed by unhonored by the citi
zens of Amador county.
Thero was nothing elaborate in the
celebration. The exercises were con
fined to the afternoon. It was ex
pected that open-air exercises would be
held, but this program was chauged,
and the exercises were held in Love's
hall at 2 o'clock. The hall was well
filled, but not crowded; many of our
citizens having left for Paloma. J. \V.
Caldwell called the meeting to order in
a short address, followed by music by
the Jackson band, after which the
Rev. Geo. H. Van Vliot offered prayer.
Geo. ,A. Gordon then read in his usual
effective style, the declaration of inde
pendoncc. Tbo chairman then intro
duced tho orator of the day, Hon. F.
L. Stewart, who gave a brief, eloquent
and appropriate address, which *vas
listened to with breathless - interest
throughout. He spoke of the work of
tho founders of the nation, of the trials
and difficulties that were encountered
In enrolling the United States among
the list of nations, how the country
had grown and prospered. The ex
periment of a government by and for
the people had proved successful beyond
the utmost dreams of its founders.
With increase of area, and commerce,
and population, and influence as a
world power, has come increased re
sponsibility, but the nation would, in
the future as in the past, be found
equal to every v emergency, and face
every duty in the spirit of progress and
human rights. The oration was well
delivered, and met with frequent ap
plause. -Mr. Stewart is au. easy, tiueot
and •graceful speaker, and every one
who heard him was impressed with the
conviction i.h at he is a man of much
mental force and ability .
In the afternoon a fetv amusements
took place on Main street, in the pres
ence of a crowd of spectators. The re
sult of the contests for prizes was as
follows: . • .
Glove contest— Between W. Chirm
and V. Borro. The two youngsters
sparred for a fow minutes and created
lots of amusement, without causing any
damage to themselves, by throwing
pillows in the shape of boxing gloves
at each other. The contest was de
cided a draw by the referee, Gus
Record, and the money, $2.50, was
divided equally between the two.
Boys' foot race, under sixteen, for
$2.50, was won by Phil Roberts.
For the girls' race there were no
entries, so a boys' race, for those under
12 years, was substituted. Dave Mat
tley succeoded in capturing the prize.
Sack race— Six youngsters started in
this race: one half of them fell by the
wayside. The prize, $2.50, fell to the
lot of Dave Mattley, the winner of -the
preceding race. x :
Barrel race— This was a source of
lots of fun. Two barrels with the
heads knocked out were placed in the
course, and through those the contest
ants had to crawl. The scramble came
at the first barrel. Rugno managed to
reach It first, and scrambled through
without much trouble. Those behind
him, however, In their anxiety, pullod
the barrel Into kindling wood. Rugae
won first prize, $2.50, und Dudley
Laughton second, 81.
For the donkey's race there wore
two entries. V. Bonnefoy on the white
and Johnny Delahide on tho dark nag.
The white won the money easily, $2.50,
with $1.50 to the second.
Bicycle race— First prize $3, second
$2. Four started. Dave Oueto won
first place and Gus Record second.
In the evening a social dance was
given in the hall, by the Jackson baud.
The admission price was $1, and the
hall was packed with patrons, who
danced until between 2 aqd J| pVlock.
The financial end of it was' In every
way satisfactory. ' The proceeds wore
for the benofit of the baud,- who gave
their services free during tho day, tor
the privilege of giving the ball at
night. •
Poisoning the Bycteiq.
It is through the bowels that the
body is cleansed of impurities. ConstU'
patlon keeps these poisons in the sys
tem, causing headache, dulness and
melancholia at first, then unsightly
eruptions, und finally serious illness
unless a remedy is applied. De Witt's
Little Early Risers prevent this trouble
by stimulating tho liver and promote
easy, healthy action of the bowels.
These little pills do not act violently,
but by strengthening the bowels enable
them to perform their own work.
Never gripe or distress. Kerr's Phar
macy, Jackson.

his parents in Oakland, and afterward
to Woodbrldge, where the funeral took
place on July 4, from the residence of

Sensational Suit at Mokelumne Hill.
John McLeou, of Mokelumne Hill,
has commenced suit in the superior
court of Oalaveras county against his
nephew, R. N. Mague, to cancel con
veyances and transfer mado by McLeoD
to Magee about a year ago. The prop
erty involved '19 the Leger hotel,
Davidson's store, . several ' dwelling
houses at the Hill, besides various uottss
and' mortgages, and $0000 in a Stockton
bank, all of the valuo of about $20,000.
About a year ago McLeoo, who is 78
years of age, aud who was formerly the
town baker, was sued by Sauio Me;
Carthy of West Point for breach of
promise. McLeon, who was very much
attached to his nephew, und who in
tended to make him his heir on his
death, promptly conveyed all his prop
erty to his nephew. Young Magee
had been oaring for McLeon a . great
many years. A few weeks ago the
breach of promise oaso was dismissed,
it is said on McLeon's promise to the
woman that he would get his property
back and marry her. But the nephew
thought it against the welfare of his
uncle to marry at his great age, and
especially to such a young woman as
Miss McCarthy, she being only about
110 year!- of agej and declined to return
all of the property unless the undo
would givu up the marriajie notion.
The undo thereupon brought the suit.
Solinsky & Wehe and 1. McSorloy ap
pear for the plaiatiff, and Wm. J. Me-
Gee has b^ou retained to defend the
suit for the nephew. A sensational
and bitter contest is expected .

Purse of SSO.
A game of baseball was played un
the Plccardo grounds last Sunday,
between a Jackson nine and a team

rangement of a match game for $25 a
side. Several of Fackson's expert
players, however, were enrolled with
the boys from the plant, Arditto and
Cademartori being among them, and
against this combination, the Jackson

White Man Tamed Yellow,
Great consternation was felt by the
friends of M^ A. Hogarty of Lexington,
Ky., when they saw he was turning
yellow. His skin slowly changed color,
also his eyes, and he suffered terribly.
His malady was. Yellow Jaundice. He
was treated by the best doctors, but
without benefit. Then he was advised
to try Electric Bitters, the ' wonderful
Stomach and Liver remedy, and he
writes: "After taking two bottles I
was wholly cured." A trial proves its
matchless merit for all Stomach, Liver
and Kidney troubles. Quly 50c. Sold

Killed a Bear.
Wilbur Balsley, the fifteen year old
grandson of James Avlse, who lives
near Jackson, had a hunting, experi
ence last week that he 'will remember
all his days. Balsley is employed by
some cattlemen, who range their stock
during the summer season above West
Point, in Calavera l county. While out
hunting the stock ho ran across a she
bear with two cubs. They were of the
cinnamon species. The old bear waxed
hostile at once in the presence of man, :
being jealous of the safety of her off
springs. Before Balsley had time to
consider what was best to be- done
under the circumstances, -the animal
made for him. Fortunately, . Balsley
had his Winchester rifle with him, ; as
the cattle hunters usually 'take that
precaution when roaming over these
wild mountain ranges. Seeing thai
escape was impossible by running, the
young hunter stood his ground, and"
when the brute was within a few feet
of him he gave her the contents of a
cartridge. His aim was perfect, and
the boar fell dead at the first shot. It
weighed over 400 pounds.' It is need
less to say that Balsley is proud of his
achievement. The cubs got away.
He is now trying to catch them ' alive
by means of traps.

Period of Growth.
Children born between September
and February are, some authorities
state, not so tall as those born in the
summer- and spring, months, and the
growth of children is much more rapid
from March Oil August. The extremi
ties grow rapidly up to the sixteenth
year, then there ls a slow growth till
the thirtieth year. . The legs chiefly
grow between the tenth nnd seven
teenth year. .
Comparing the general results, it ap
pears that there are six periods of
growth. The first extends up to the
sixth or eighth year and is one of very
rapid growth; the second period, from
eleven to fourteen years, growth ;Is
slow; tbe third period, from sixteen to
seventeen; the fourth period shows a
slow growth up to the age of thirty for
height, up to fifty for chest girth; the
fifth period ls one of rest, from thirty
to fifty years; tbe sixth period is char
acterized by a decrease In all dimen
sions of the body.

It has been discovered that the hu

steadily moving toward the left of the
face, which will In time bring it some
where In the neighborhood of the left
ear. . All the fire great races of man
bare an uncontrollable tendency to eat
only with the teeth which grow from
the left jaws. This wears out the left
teeth more rapidly than those on the
right side of the mouth, and this in
turn gives the upper and lower jaws
an Inclination toward the left.

scientists who are foremost iv the

In the course of time the mouth from
causes above mentioned will have com

COFFEE ADULTERANTS.
The List Rnns Throagh the Alphabet
From A to W.
If all of the substances that paE6
through a coffee grinding machine dur
ing the year should be written in al-,
phabetical order, "a" would begin the
list with acorns, and "w" would end it
with wormwood, sprouts of which are
sometimes used to give the debased
coffee a Blight aromatic bitter taste.
Adulteration occurs largely in the
coffee that ls sold in the ground form.
Several coffeo berry factories have
been discovered in Europe which wore
doing a large and profitable business
by molding an admixture of tanbark.
etovc rust, clay, sawdust, chicory,
coffee sediment and coffee moal into
a neat berry by the aid of some agglu
tlnant, and these berries were so well
made that the deception was not dis
covered for a long time. This produc
tion had a large sale among the lower
classes of Rusteia and Poland," nnd.
mixed with the genuine coffeo berry,
Its sale was quite lively in otlirr parts
of Europe. ■ •
Unroasted coffee berries are often
made from oat and rye flour and corn
meal. The' natural aroma of these
grains is destroyed by Borne process,
and after the proper amount of coffee
aroma ie added the berries are formed
and caused to maintain their shape by
Borne adhesive substance. The test
usually employed to discover this de
ception is to place the beans' in n re
ceptacle containing. warm water, which
will dissolve them In a few hours.—

HARD TO GET STARTED.
Things Which 0-re.rcome a. Writer
Whan Beginning an Article.
There is a feeling of timidity that
oftentimes overcomes a writer when
beginning an article. As In writing- a
letter, it is getting started that puzzles.
It is the custom to begin with slow
moving piston and work gradually into
full speed until the flow of words ls
free, and then the difficulty with some
of us is to find the brake valve. Again,
a writer sometimes discovers that bis
beginning 1b a more fitting ending, and
vice versa. The newspaper style is to
throw general conclusions up strong
under tbe headlines, while the sermon
ixer reserves them nctll bis final cli
max. .
Thackeray remarked once that be
could never tall exactly what be was
going to say until his pen was in hand
and under motion and then did not fully
realize Just what be was saying until it
was written. .There is. a Bubconscloui
ness that shapes writing as it does
speaking. This. I know, disturbs some
well known theories of speaking and
writing— as to weighing everything and
then measuring it out as a druggist
compounds a prescription— but my ob
servations are that tbe preparation is
more in getting full of a subject and
then letting tbe mind work free under
tbe Impulse of the dominating idea.
;There are as many ways and meth
ods in writing and speaking as there
are individuals, and yet the fundamen
tal law in the transmission of thought
and speech runs largely in the same
groove, whether it be the Jargon of tho
Hottentot or the polished periods of
the scholar. Human nature has its:
own primitive impulses that defy all.
rules of rhetoric and the power of ex
pression—that le, the power, mind you
—is deeper seated than any artificial
formula of stylists. — National Maga

Imitating the Mnalo of a Cascade.
Certain tribes on tbe Amazon have
been fascinated by the music of the
waterfall. Musical Instruments were
found in use among them consisting of
a complicated mechanism by which
water was poured from ono bowl into
another, in imitation of the cascade,
and then returned by tho receiving
bowl into the vessel which had poured
it, co that by a repetition of this mech
anism a constant uiurmur of a cascade
could be kept up bo long as the audi
ence desired or the player was able to
perform it.

Gnests Pass With Glaciers.
Hotel keepers in the Alps bave a new
trouble and are complaining of the loss
of patrons, who are moving away trom
the glaciers. Yes, the attractive gla
ciers are actually ~ passing from the
landscape, and as they recede the ho
tels along their borders find that their
registers are shortening.
These glaciers arc not running away
by any means, but they are deteriorat
ing slowly with a. persistency that
means their final annihilation. Hotels
that a few years ago stood very near
to a great river of slowly moving ice

tance away, SEi the attractiveness of
the site is lessened.
Tho famous glaciers of the Rhone
bave shrunk 8,000 feet in the last twen
ty years, or about 110 feet a year. .A
number of tbe well known glaciers ap

entific fact ls established that these re
minders of the great glacial period are
surely disappearing.

conquer or die, promised his soldiers
that if they secured the victory those
who fell should 'din* that very day

combat with alacrity, but rinding that
the cardinal was careful not to expose
himself, "How is it," said one of them,

H«'Wu ■ Financier.
Two members of the Chicago Stock
Exchange went to a restaurant for
luucheon, ami after a hasty glance at
the bill of fare each announced what
he wanted.
'Tni for a fried bass," said one.
. "Ditto," eaid the other. "Waitress,
two fried bass, please."
In a few minutes, the two bass on a
platter and two plates were placed on
the table. One bass was larger than
the* other, nnd the financier ■ before
wbom the platter had been placed
raluilj- passed the smaller bass to his
companion.
"Now I call that a downright mean
trlcki" said th. man who received the
smaller bass.
"What ls a mean trick?"
. "Why, to give me the smaller bass
nnd keep the big one for yourself."
"What would you have done if you
tad been serving the fish?" .
"I vsnould certainly have given you
the larger one."
"Well, in that case 1 should have had
the larger one. I've got it now. What
more do you want?"

A Sacred Chinese Coin.
One of the coins of the Chinese Em
peror Kanghl Is very much sought aft
er by the Chinese, who use it in mak
ing rings for the finger. It is slightly
different from the other cash Issued
under the same emperor in the form of
one of the characters that indicate the
regnal period. The Chinese call it "Lo
han cash," the word Lo-ban being a
transcript In Chinese characters of the
Banskrlt word Arhan, "venerable,"
the name applied to the eighteen at
tendants of Buddha, who are frequent
ly seen ranged along the two sides of
the principal halls in Buddhist tem
ples. ..
The tradition ls that while the em
peror was intimately associated with
European missionaries be became im
bued with a feeling of contempt for
Buddhism and illustrated this phase
of his faith by having a set of eighteen
brass Lo-ban images melted down and
cast into cash. This brass is said to
contain a considerable portion of gold;
hence the demand for tbe cash.
She Had to Diet.
Doctors sometimes give their direc

tragic, but more often amusing, mis
takes occur thereby. _ Judge tells one
of the amusing kind, although it might
have been uncomfortable at least.

The Force of Example.
When we read the life stories of men
and women, we ourselves participate
to some extent in their own experi
ences. Insensibly we place ourselves
in the situations in which they found
themselves, and the problems -which
confronted them seek their solution in
our own brains. Their difficulties, their
stumblings, their triumphs, become
personal lessons by which we may
get a wider experience of life than
comes to us in our ordinary avoca
tions, so that when the tinio conies
when we are called upon for some mo
mentous decision or to pursue some
special line of conduct we have a prec
edent to guide us to the right course.—

The Spaniards are the most expert

takes a heavy pull at his cigarette, in
bales it, takes up a wine skin or wine
bottle, pours_ a half pint down his
throat, holding the vessel a foot from
bis mouth and not spilling a drop, and
then with a sigh of satisfaction closes
bis eyes and exhales tbe smoke from
bis nose and mouth in clouds. He will
also inhale the smoke, converse for a
few minutes in a natural manner and
then blow out tbe smoke.
