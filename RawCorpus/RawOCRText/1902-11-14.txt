REMARKABLE LAKE.
A Body of Water With a Roof of
Solidified Salt.
A lake with a Bait roof Isn't frozej?
salt aud it Isn't underground. On tho
contrary, this remarkable lake may be
seen at any time during the year, fully
exposed, being even at its best when
the sun Is shining directly upon It,
This wonderful body of water Is one of
the saltest of the salt lakes and Is sit
uated near Obdorsk, Siberia. The lake
Is nine miles wide and seventeen long
iukl within the memory of man was
not entirely roofed over by the salt de
posit Originally evaporation played
the most prominent part hi coating the
lake over with salt, but at the present
time the salt springs which surround
it are adding fast to the thickness of
the crust
In the long ago rapid evaporation of
the lake's waters left great salt crys
tals floating on the surface. In course
of time these caked together. Thus the
waters were finally entirely covered.
In ISTS the lake found an underground
outlet Into the river Obi. which low
ered Its surface about three feet The
salt crust was so thick, however, that
it retained its old level and now pre
sents the curious spectacle of a salt
roofed hike. The salt coat increnses
sis inches in thickness every, year. The
many islands with which tht> lake Is
studded are said to net ns braces and
to help keep the arched salt crust in
position.

Mrs. C. was horrified to discover that
her little seven-year-old daughter was
acquiring ' tbe habit of alluding very
freely to the devil, and at last she told
her determinedly that a repetition of
the obnoxious word would bring severe
punishment ■
The child knew that her mother was
in earnest, so she set a seal on her lips.
At last she seemed to have forgotten
It, but one Sunday Mrs. C. who had
been too ill to go to church, asked her
If she could tell what the minister had
preached about in his sermon.
"Oh, yes'ru," she answered. "He
preached about our Lord going up into
the mountain and being tempted by—
by — by the gentleman who keeps hell!"

refusing to touch alcohol in any form.

ly adhered to In the face of cold, hun

excitement of ceremonial rites. What

The late Dr. Talmage once called on
his lawyer and found two of his pa

private nature.
; "Ah, doctor," called the lawyer in
greeting, "good morning! Here are two
of your flock. May I ask without Im
pertinence if you regard them ns black
sheep or. white?"
"I don't know as yet," replied Tal
mage dryly, "whether they're black or
white, but I'm certain that if they re
main here long they'll be fleeced."
Very Sad.
"Yes, it's very sad."
"How is that"
"Why, he always held that to train

AN ENGLISHMAN'S WIFE.
(he Is Really Her'Haaband'a Bnalaeaa
Partner and Acta It.
"In England," says Ainslee's Maga
tlne. "a man's wife Is In renlity his
partner, and whether or not the two
are In harmony with each other In af
fection In all material things they rec
pgnize that then? fortunes are Irrevoca
bly bouud together, that the interests
of both are quite, identical and that
each lias just as strong a motive for
making things go well as has tbe other,
since they share equally the labor and
the reward therefrom. They may have
then- private disagreements, but they
front the world together. The wife
takes tbe keenest interest In the most
minute details of everything that af
fects her husband's welfare. She
knows his income to a penny. She
manages her household as a chancellor
of the exchequer manages the nation's
outlay, so that the annual budget shall
not only avoid a deficit and shall accu
rately' balance, but so that it shall
sbow a surplus. She will practice a
rigid economy if necessary, and in do
lug so sue will feel tbat she is merely
carrying out her share of the marriage
contract It is tbe man's part to make
money; It is her part to help' him save
It She pliius nothing for herself apart
from him. She cannot think of him as
in anything apart from her. If he -Is
In political life, she enters Into his am
bitions with intelligence and zeal. She
will write his letters for him and en
tertain his constituents. She will study
the bluebooks and teach herself to un
derstand the public 'questions with
which be has to deal, so that she may
discuss them with him and follow his
career intelligently. She belongs to
him, in fact as he belongs to her.
There Is not much display of sentiment
in an English household after the first
year of married life has ended, bnt
there is tbe bond of a common interest
which grows stronger every day and
every year and which gives to man
and wife a unity of purpose and of
feeling that will beyond comparison
outlast the cobweb tissues of emotion
alism."
He Was a Butcher.
"Now, 1 rather pride myself on my
ability to read character," said the
man who was given to buying detec
tive tales, "and yet why should I? It
Is really a very simple thing; requires
nothing but close observation. For In
stance, It Is easy to tell a man's occu
pation. His facial expression, his ac
tions, even his dress, are stamped by
his dally work. You see that man sit
ting opposita us? Well, I am just as
sure as though he bad told me that he
is a barber."
"You are mistaken," replied his friend.
"That man Is a butcher."
"Impossible!" exclaimed the amateur
detective. "You never saw a butcher
with slim white hands, like his."
"Perhaps not" admitted the other,
"but he is a butcher Just the. same."
"How do you know he Is?"
"How do I kuo,w? Why, the scoun
drel shaved me once." — Household

Burial Alive.
Though it is possible that cases of
burial of living persons may still occur,
fortunately they are more rare than in
former times. Even the doctor's orders
against Interment were not always
obeyed, for the Gentleman's Magazine
of 1751 relates the case of Richard
Carson of Hay, Herefordshire, Eng
land, who was supposed to have died,
but a doctor declared that Carson still
lived and ordered that he was not to bo
buried. His relatives paid no heed to
the injunction, and the body was com
mitted to the grave next day. A per
son passing through the churchyard
beard a noise and prevailed on the
clerk to open the grave, where the
supposed corpse was found in a pro
fuse sweat and bleeding at the nose.
Unfortunately the man was beyond re
covery and soon died.
The Llama.
In Bolivia, one of the highest inhab
itated countries on the globe— La Paz,
the capital, being 12,000 feet above the
sea level— much use is made of that
graceful and invaluable pack animal,
the llama, which will travel farther
and with even less food than tbe burro,
but will not carry more than 150
pounds. The llama in some respects re
sembles the camel, kneeling In camel
fashion to receive its load, and it will
not rise if more than 150 pounds are
placed on its back; moreover, the
weight must be evenly distributed over
its back and sides. ' . .
Grapes.
"Grapes dissolve and dislodge gravel
and calculi," says the doctor. They
bring the stomach and bowels to a
healthy condition. Even the consump
tive finds new life in them and should
take grape juice by the tumblerful
daily, as it makes new, rich blood. It
builds up the tissues and feeds starved
nerves. It Is also cleansing.
Ughtnlns Rapidity.
It Is absolutely impossible for us to
conceive of the rapidity and brilliancy
of lightning. It has been estimated
that a flash occupies less than one-mil
lionth part of a second. -As one-tenth
of a second is needed for the fnll effect
of any light upon the eye, we get oily
a very faint Idea of the brilliancy of
the flash.
Canse For tne Condition.
"You don't shine so brilliantly ns of
yore," remarked the oil.
"No," said the wick; "I have been
turned down by Miss Maude becausa
that young simpleton Is coming"—

CHOATE'S ADVICE.
M ted n Choleric Client Into th«
Patha of Peace.
It seems always to have h«in within
th» power of the distinguished lawyer
and humorist, Rufus Choate, to lead
a choleric client from ways of anger
into the paths of peace. Just before
the war a southern gentleman wa»
dining with a friend In one of the best
hotels of Boston. He was of French
Creole extraction, and his name was
Delacour, says a writer In Lippincott's
Magazine. The waiter was a colored
man, and the southerner gave his or
ders in a very domineering fashion,
finding fault freely with what was put
before him and the way In which it
was served. Finally the waiter became
Incensed and told Mr. Delacour to go
to a place warm and remote. The lat
ter /sprang furiously to his feet and
would bave shot the offender dead If
he ihad not been restrained by his
wiser friend, who said:
"You can't do that sort of thing here.
You will have to remember where you
are." :
"Do you suppose that 1 am going to
put up with such Insolence and not
be revenged?" said the enraged man.
"Certainly not But do it by process
of law."
The landlord was first Interviewed
and the waiter discharged. That was
not sufficient to satisfy the wounded
feelings of Mr. Delacour. He asked
who was the best lawyer in the city
and was told it was Rufus Choate.
"Making his way to his office, he said:
-, "Mr. Choate, I want to engage you
in a case. What will your retaining
The check was made out and handed
over.
"Now," said the lawyer, "what are
the facts of the case?"
He was told. Said Mr. Choate
thoughtfully:
"I know the United States law on
the subject well, and I know the law
of the commonwealth of Massachu
setts, and I can assure you, sir, that
there is no power on earth strong
enough to force you to go to that
place If you don't want to go. And If
I were you I wouldn't"
"Well," said the southerner, accept
ing the situation, "I think I'll take your
advice." And they parted good friends.
POULTRY 'POINTERS.
Supply plenty of gravel to fowls that
are being fattened In confinement
Chickens should never be allowed to
go on the roosts until ten or twelve
weeks old.
Lime is a purifier and should be used
as a wash on the coops, perches and
nest boxes. '...
' If a hen lays soft shelled eggs, give
her plenty of gravel, oyster shells and
crushed bone.
Ducks should be allowed as much
liberty as possible. They are not par
tial to confinement
Flat eggs, eggs within eggs, double
yolked eggs and other unnatural for
mations are due to the hens being over
fat
Geese may be fattened on any kind
of grain if fed all that they will eat for
about ten days before sending them to,
market Corn, peaa and barley are'
best.
Young chicks of fancy breeding
should not be permitted to rooet on
perches until after they are eight
months old, as it often causes crooked
breast bones.
Accumulating filth Is a prolific source
of disease, especially gapes. After the
poultry yard is cleaned up sprinkle It
well with diluted carbolic acid and a
little copperas.

She had just handed him the frosty

"If you are ever in trouble," he said,
"do not hesitate to lift up your voice,
and you will find me 'Johnny on the

"I'm in trouble now," answered the
human refrigerator, with a sigh long
drawn out
"And, behold," exclaimed the unsus
pecting youth, "I am here."
"Yes," she said, "that's the trouble."

Bnlldoo; Kinder Than Child.
- An Incident related by George Eliot
{troves that kindness and devotion are
characteristic of the bulldog breed.
The distinguished author was on a vis
it to the house of a friend where a
bulldog and a child, each of the age of
six. were among the household posses
sions. During dessert after dinner,
while all were absorbed in conversa
tiou, they were startled by a loud howl
of palu from the dog, evidently pro
ceeding from under the table. An In
vestigation .immediately made discov
ered that the child, equipped with a
pair of scissors,' was under the table
also and trying to cut the dog's ears
with them. From one ear of the bull
the blood was running, and yet the
dog was making not the slightest ef
fort to escape or defend himself. The
host and father, outraged by the evi
dence of such cruelty on the" part of
the child, determined on immediate
punishment. But when he undertook
to carry the punishment into effect the
dog Interfered, pushing himself be
tween the master and the child and
licking the face of the latter. *
His Revenge.
M. Colombies, a merchant of Paris,
had his revenge on a former sweet
heart, a lady of Rouen, when he left
her by will a legacy of $6,000 for hav
ing some twenty years before refused
to marry him, "through which," states
the will, "I was enabled to live inde
pendently and happily as a bachelor."
Strangers Now.
"You ought to see the lovely letters
my husband writes," said the bride of
a month to one of her girl friends.
"Oh, I've seen a few," rejoined the
dear girl friend. "In fact I've got near
ly a trunkful of them in the attic."—

Salt pork is a famous old-
fashioned remedy for con-
sumption. "Eat plenty of
pork," was the advice to the
consumptive 50 and 100
years ago.
Salt pork is good if a man
can stomach it. The idea
Behind it is that fat is the
iooj the consumptive needs
most.
Scott'sEmulsionisthemod-
ern method of feeding fat to
the consumptive. Pork is too
rough for sensitive stomachs.
Scott's Emulsion is the most
refined of fats, especially
prepared for easy digestion.
Feeding him fat in this
way, which is often the only
way, is half the battle, but
Scott's Emulsion does more
than that. There is some-

A BANK'STORYo
Am Incident That Startled the Old
Lady of Throddnoedlo Street.
Some years ago the directors of the
Bank of England were startled to re
ceive an Invitation to meet axi un
known man in the strongroom of the
bank at midnight "You think you is
ail safe hand yon bank bis safe, but
I knows better. J bin hinslde the
bank the last 2 nite hand you nose
nufun about it But lam nott a theaf
so hif yer will mett mcc in the great
squar room,. with all the moneiys, at
twelf 2 nite, He explain orl to you, let
only thor 2 cum down, and say uuffln
to nobody." The strongroom was
guarded the next night In spite of a
disposition to regard the letter as a
hoax by police and— nothing happened.
The next phase of the mystery was
more astonishing than ever. A heavy
chest of papers and securities taken
from the strongroom arrived at the
bank, with a letter complaining that
the directors had set the police upon
the writer, and that he had therefore
not appeared as he promised,^ but to
prove that he was neither a thief nor
a fool he sent a chest of papers he had
taken from the bank. Let a few gen
tlemen be alone in the room, and he
would join them at midnight, said '":e
writer, and to cut short a long and
strange chapter of bank history, a man
with a dark lantern burst into' the
strongroom of the bank at midnight
after calling from behind ' the stone
walls for the directors to put out the
lights. He was one of a strange class
of men who gained a living by search
ing the sewers at night, and through
an opening from a sewer he had found
his way Into the richest room In the
world.— St. James Gazette.
The Strain on Parents.
"What Is mohair, mammy?" asked
Sally Peterson Jones, looking up from
her slow perusal of the newspaper and
keeping her place on the page with a
dusky forefinger.
Mammy Jones began to rock "faster.

you?" she Inquired.
"Oh, yas'm," responded Sally prompt
ly. -
"Well, den, does you know wat a mo

faster.
"No'm," admitted Sally with great
reluctance. •
"Well, chile, you can't 'spec' me to

ly, allowing the rocking chair to slack

There Is one lawyer in Brooklyn who
will never again make use of Latin
phrases in writing business letters. A
short time ago he had to write a letter
to a client in a neighboring city regard
ing an important lawsuit tha_t_was to
come up before the court in the course
of a few days. The information he so
licited was highly essential to his case.
In writing this epistle he made use of
a letter head with his printed address
at the top. In closing his letter he sign
ed himself thus, "John Langdon. ad
dress ut supra."
After waiting several days for the
reply, which did not come, he again
wrote his procrastinating clieut aud
asked why he had not sooner answered
his first letter. The next day he re
ceived a reply in which the clieut said
that he had answered the letter and
addressed it to "John Langdon, Ut
Supra, N. Y."

Nothing can move her. Perhaps it was
on this account that when she returned
from the celebration of the one hun

to Influence her.
"I've been there, and it's over with,"
she said, "and now I'm home safe aft

horses and crying children and men
making speeches, I want to tell you

'A MONTANA BLUFF."
now Four. Troopers Undo Sovonty
flvo Filipinos Flee.
What Is regarded as one of the tallest
bluffs on record furnished Captain Ed
gar Russel, chief signal officer in the"
Philippines during the Insurrection,
with a story which he told as an exam
ple of western nerve.
"We were outside of Manila In some
little scrap," said the captain, "and
about' seventy-five natives were lying
In a trench ahead of us, shooting away
merrily, but not hitting anybody. By
and by I noticed a little disturbance in
our front Presently four Montana
troopers trotted out of our lines and
started straight for the Filipinos. Ev
erybody looked at them with wonder
and waited to see them all killed. Bul
lets whistled all around them, but they
never halted. Slowly, just at a trot,
they jogged on toward the enemy. The
natives fired and fired, but for some
unknown reason did not hit. On and
on went the quartet, disdaining cover.
At last there was a shout, and to our
utter astonishment we beheld the sev
enty-five Filipinos suddenly jump out
of then* trenches and take to their
heels In mad flight The nerve of the
Montana troopers was too much for
tlH<ro. When they had all fled, throw
ins their rifles away as they ran, the
troopers came back, their arms full of
guns. That is what the army called 'a
Montana bluff.' It's the sort of nerve
that lets a man open a jackpot on a
pah- of deuces."— New York Tribune.
The Women -of Lansam,
Woman supreme— without the ballot!
And this feather which London An
swers sticks in the cap of woman is no
less brilliant because she is allowed to
wear it only in the town of Langum.
In that little Welsh village man
neither is nor pretends to be. In other
villages he sometimes pretends to be,
but In this sequestered nook on the
Pembrokeshire coast he is simply An
nie Williams' man or Mary Jones'
man and recognizes himself as such.
In Langum woman is the dominating
force In the market; she is the house
hold financier, the family accountant,
and in fact fills all the positions which
in any other community, civilized or
barbaric, are established by precedent
given to man. Whether he of Langum
has resigned or been divested of all re
sponsibilities of life is no part of this
story. ,•?.,
There is another important fact In

TALK OF CONTEST.
A howl is being made all over the
state on account of the throwing out of
ballots stamped opposite the words
"No nomination. " There is no ques
tion that both parties lost heavily from
this cause. ' The supreme court, has
held that a cross so placed is a dis
tinguishing mark within the meaning
of the law, and that ballots so marked
should be rejected. In nearly every
county in the state there were vacancies
on the ticket, designated in this man
ner. In some counties the republicans
were at a disadvantage in this respect,
while in others the democrats were the
losers. In Amador county the repub
licans had one unfilled space of this
character on the county ticket, in the
office of recorder, while both republi
cans and democrats had one or more in
each, township for township officers.
Outside of Jackson, however, we have
not heard that any votes were rejected
because of their being stamped in either
of those spaces. The matter was
brought to the attention of several
election boards, j(nd they decided to
count such ballots. In North Jackson,
East Jackson, and West Jackson a
number of ballots were rejected on this
score, amounting in all to about 30.
They were all republican tickets, as
the democratic ticket had no unfilled
place in township one. In rejecting
them, the boards acted at the request
of democratic attorneys, who appeared
before them and urged them to take
this course, on the strength of a de
cision of the supreme court to that
effect. The republican vote on the
head of the ticket would have been 'at
least 40 more had it not been for this
action. We do not believe in disfran
chising: a citizen on such frivolous
grounds. If such technical construc
tions of the law are to govern, it is not
surprising that the repeal of the Aus
tralian voting system is being agitated.
In a number of precincts in this coun
ty the number of ballots counted for
governor fell 15 per cent short of the
total number of votes cast. This is a
serious discrepancy, and out of all pro
portion to the lost votes under the : old
system. With all its faults, however,
the present ballot law is an improve
ment on the old-time method. The
cry for its repeal will meet with scant
favor. In the end, the discussion which
has resulted from the '.'no nomination"
feature, will probably lead to a more
liberal interpretation of the law in re
gard to distinguishing marks, or ' a
modification of the law, so that such a
simple mistake on the part of the voter
shall not warrant the throwing out of
the entire ballot. The talk of contest
ing the election of Pardee on this score
is moonshine. The democrats fully
believed they were going to land their
man in the governor's chair, and they
found a morsel of comfort in the de
lusion that had the rejected ballots
been counted the outcome would have
been different, They kicked in both
directions. They were loud in demand
ing that ballots so marked should be
thrown out in Amador and other coun
ties; they are now equally loud in say
ing that such votes should, have been
counted in other counties where their
candidates were the chief sufferers.

Walnuts in Amador ' County,
[Communicated.]
It used to be thought that the so
called English walnut counld not profit
ably be grown anywhere in California
except on certain deep rich soils near
the coast in the southern part of the
state. It is still true that the most
productive walnut orchards are found
in that locality; but repeated trials and
the introduction of new varieties have
proved that softshell walnuts can be
grown to advantage in other localities
with quite different climatic conditions,
notably in the foothill region of central
California, of which Amador county
forms a part. The success of Felix
Gillet of Nevada county, and of other
pioneer growers in the introduction of
new varieties, hardier than the old Los
Angeles nut, has greatly extended the
area of walnut culture in the state, and
demonstrated that the softshell walnut
may be successfully grown wherever a
moderate depth of soil and adequate
moisture may be had, coupled with
reasonable freedom from late spring
frosts. >
Such situations may readily be found
in Amador county,' as is shown by the
results obtained at various points in
this neighborhood, particularly at the
Agricultural Experiment Station,
where a number of the best varieties
are now in bearing.
Early plantings of walnut trees in
this county were made on' the creek
bottoms, where they have seldom borne
fruit, the blossoms being usually nipped
by frost. The trees at the station are
on a hilltop, or, to be more exact, on a
high saddle between two summits, at
an elevation of nearly 2000 feet above
sea level— a location much less subject
to frosts than the low lands along' the
creeks, but no more favored in this re
spect than many other places in the
foothills of this county. Here, there
were planted in 1889, the following soft
shell varieties: The Common English
or Madeira nut, Santa Barbara soft
shell, Dwarf Prolific or Praeparturiens,
Mayette, Franquette, Vourey, Serotina
or St. John, Chaberte, Kapbazi (Per
sian) and Bijou. These began to bear
in 1896, though Bijou and Santa Bar
bara softshell bore a little the previous
year. Madeira and Chaberte have
never borne more than a few nuts until
the present year, but the other varie
ties have gradually increased their
crops as the trees grow older.
Bijou, a variety of French origin 1 ,
has so far proven the most productive,
and also bears the largest nut- The
nut is peculiar in shape, oval, pointed
at both ends, in size about 2} inches by
1§ inches. The shell is much cor
rugated, and is very soft, so as to be
easily broken by the fingers. It does
not fill perfectly, and consequently the
kernel is not as large as one would sup
pose from the size of the shell, but it is
nevertheless much larger than that of
any other variety. The tree is a vig
orous grower, and so far a regular and
heavy bearer. Its crop this year was
115 pounds.
Next to ■ Bijou in productiveness
comes the Santa Barbara softshell and
Praeparturiens (Dwarf Prolific), both
good growers and regular bearers of
good crops. The nuts of each are of
medium size and excellent quality.
Each bore about 50 pounds this year.
None of the other varieties approach
those trees in growth or bearing, but
it should be noted that these are on
deeper soil than the others, -and 're
ceive some irrigation by seepage from
the garden, as also does the Persian.
The other varieties have so far had no
irrigation, and . have borne but small
crops, in no case exceeding 16 pounds
to the tree. The best of them are the
Franquette, Mayette and Vourey, all
French varieties of much promise,
bearing nuts of large size and the finest
quality, the flavor being particularly
delicate. Franquette, the largest of
them, has a shell naturally so light
colored as to need no bleaching. May
ette and Vourey also are noteworthy in
this respect. Considering the size and
quality of their fruit, and the import
ant fact that these varieties put forth
their leaves three weeks later thai>
those previously mentioned, and are
thus mnch less likely to be caught by
spring fro3ts, they undoubtedly deserve
wide trial in the foothills. On deeper
soil with more moisture than they have
had hitherto at the station they would
probably bear better; indeed, it is not
unlikely that they may improve in this
respect at the station as the trees grow
older.
Serotina and Chaberte also leaf out
late in the season, but so far they have
not berne well enough at the station to
merit recommendation.
Astounding Discovery.
From Coopersville, Mich., comes
word of a wonderful discovery of a
pleasant tasting liquid that when used
before retiring any one troubled
with a bad cough always ensures a good
night's. rest. "It will soon cure = the
cough too," writes Mrs. S. Homel
burger, "for three generations of our
family have used Dr. King's New Dis
covery for Consumption and never
found its equal for Coughs and Colds."
It's an unrivaled life-saver when used

No sideboard is quite complete with
out a bottle of "Jesse Moore" rye or
bourbon whisky. It is better than the
kind you have always considered best.
Miss Bertha Samuels Icame up from
the city Wednesday evening, and will
remain in Jackson until the closing-out
auction sale of her father's stock of dry
goods is concluded.
Deafness Cannot be Cared
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion- of the ear
There is only one way to cure deafness,
and that is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con->
dition of the mucous lining of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can be
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars
for any case of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free.

There is some talk of starting a

lave been started, but whether the
cherae will ever develop beyond the
alking stage is problematical.

W. C. Ralston managed to pull
.hrough as state senator by the narrow
nargin of fifty votes. This is not a
creditable showing in a district with
ully 500 republican majority. It was
Jalaveras that downed him. * Our
ister county has a faculty of knocking
ts own candidates on the republican
ide. This disposition to scalp rcpub
icans is more pronounced there than
n Arnador county, and it is bad
inough to be disheartening here. With
republican majority of 250, the party
nanaged to elect one lone county of
icer—-treasurer — and a majority of the
ward of supervisors.
-There is some talk of contesting the
loction of Ralston as state senator. It
s claimed that enough republican bal
ots having the cross stamped opposite
he words "no nomination," were
ounted in Am'ador and other counties
o change the result. As far as the claim
tself is concerned it is probably true.
Jut whether Ralston would be unseated
m such a showing is altogether a
llfferent question. We do not believe
, republican legislature would under
ake to throw a republican put on. any
laid technicality of that character,
fhe members of the minority party
vill doubtless conclude, when <the bit
«rness of defeat has subsided, to leave
.he matter severely alone. ''
August Maron camo down from El

Tuesday, on foot. He is the man who
las written to the Ledger about the
Lester cattle-stealing case. Some one
nailed him a, copy of the campaign
;ircular issued by U S Gregory. The
etter was post-marked at Pine Grove.
[Jpon receiving the same, and reading
.he complimentary notice therein con.
serning himself, he concluded to come
» Jackson, with the intention of com
nenelng proceedings, on account of
.he defamatory matter contained in the
drcular. He called upon Justice
Soldner for that purpose, and was told
to see the district attorney. That
jfficial was out of town at the time,
md the outcome of his visit we have
sot learned.
The Passing of Benny Boss.
Benjamin Rot-s jr. depavted this life
at the Clara Barton hospital, San Fran
cisco, on the 28th day of October, after
an illness of nearly two years. All was
done for him that could be done by the
best medical skill at his home in Vol
cano, aud also in ADgels Camp. At
one time the disease from which he
suffered seemed to have yielded to the
treatment he received, and his rela
tives and friends had hopes of his ulti
mate recovery, but it proved to be only
temporary relief. It was then thought
advisable to remove him to San Fran
cisco, in order that he might bavo the
skillful nursing that his case demanded.
It was soon known that the disease
from which ho suffered (malignant
cancer) must prove fatal. Ho lived
only about a week after reaching the
hospital. Ho kept on his ;foet till the
last, having walked four blocks only a
few hours before he died. His sister,
Miss Grace Ross, was with him in his
last moments. The news of his death
cast a feeling of sadness over his many
friends in iVoleano, and brought tho
deepest sorrow to his widowed mother,
whose grief over the death of her hus
band, tho late lamented Benjamin
Ross sr., the hand of time had hardly
softened. After the death of his father,
young. Benny, although not strong,
bravely and cheerfully assumed the
duties of bread winner, and for months
persevered in the most laborious work,
cheerfully and without complaint. On
the very day he died he had a smile
and a pleasant word for everyone.
Everybody liked Benny Ross, and
deeply regret his untimely death.
Benjamin Ross jr, was born in Volcano,
Amador county, Cal., on tho 24th of
Sept., 1881. \
He lett us in Autumn, when flowers were fading,
T'was the springtime ot life whun bo bade us
adieu,
And left us to mourn o'er thu grave wbcre they
laid him,
For the loved ono whose heart was so tender
and true.
That dear form will be missed from the family
circle,
That dear face we will sco on earth never more.
Though we must go on in sorrow and trouble,
Let this thought console us, his sorrows aro
o'er. . *
For Deputies.
It is generally understood that Fred
Jackson of Sutter Creek, a detective of
unquestioned ability, and state-wide
reputation in tho ferreting out of crime,
has been selected as chief deputy by
sheriff-elect T. K. Norman. Air. Jack
son has been a deputy in tho sheriff's
office of San Joaquin county, while the
official himself was around making his
canvass for votes. The election over,
Jackson returned to his home in Ama
dor county. A. report has been cir
culated that Jackson had accepted a
deputyship in San Joaquin, and con
sequently could not bo deputy in Ama
dor county: The explanation is, 'that
his engagement in San Joaquin was
merely temporary, and terminated with
tho election, so that be was then free
to accept a position at the hands of
Amador's newly elected sheriff. For a
second deputy Mr. Norman has selected
H. E_. Kay, present constable of Jack
sou. These appointments will give
general satisfaction.' Both meu are
capable and energetic, and their selec
tion is an augury that tho incoming
administration of the sheriff's oltice
will be thorough-paced in every respect.
Rainfall.
One of the heaviest rainstorms we
have had for years was experienced in
Jackson during Sunday night. Satur
day and Sunday slight showers oc
curred, but Sunday night the rain de
scended in torrents. For over an hour
the water fell in one continuous stream.
Tho storm seems to have been general
throughout the county. In the eastern
section, it is reported, the precipitation
was even greater than in Jackson. It
was a warm rain; little snow fell except
far up in the mountains. The rainfall
according to tho Ledger gauge, is as
follows:
Nov. 8 0.09
Nov. 9 0.12
Nov. 10 1.75
Nov. 13 0.3S
Total for week 2.34

Wedded in San Andreas.
The Calaveras Prospect chronicles
the wedding of Gustavo Guerard, the
only son of Mr. and Mrs. Gueiard of
Jack sou, to Miss Agnes Fillipini, which
took place at the home of the bride's
mother in San Andreas on Sunday,
November 2. Mrs. Norma Cassinelli
played the wedding march, as the
couple attended by Miss Amelia Zwinge
as bridesmaid and Yancy Do Witt as
best man, took their places before the
Key. Father, and the solemn ceremony ,
was said. Music, both iustrumental
and vocal followed, after which a boun
tiful supper was served.
Tho bride is the "youngest daughter
of Mrs. V. Fillipini of San Andreas,
and is a very popular young lady, and
a prominent Native Daughter, she has
a wide circle of friends in this vicinity.
The groom has been living for some
time at Quart? Mt., Tuolumne county,
where the couple will make their home.
Wednesday ev'ng the Native Daugh
ters of tho local parlor called upon
the newly wedded pair, and tendered
their congratulations. They wore
most hospitably received, and cake and
wine were served. Thursday morning
Mr. ■and Mrs. puerard left for San
Francisco on their wedding tour. The
bridal pair wore the recipients of a
number of useful and handsome presents
from their many friends.

ness in Jackson, I will offer fqr sale at

Examination of Owen Fallon.
The preliminary examination of
Owen Fallon, charged with the murder
of Ray Meeha.n, on the morning of
August 17, was ' held before Judge
Goldner on Monday last. The district
attorney represented the people, and
W. J. McGee the defendant. The tes
timony for the prosecution was con
fined to the circumstances of the shoot
ing. It was intended merely to intro
duce sufficient testimony to warrant
the court in holding the accused for
trial. The defense Introduced some
testimony, probably intended as the
basis of an application for bail. The
court held Fallon to answer without
bail. V •
Mrs D. Maher met with a severe ac
cident last Tuesday. She fell down a
stairway- of eight or nine steps in the

on the head and fracturing one rid on
the left side. Dr B. H. Schact is at-
tending the case, and the patient is
getting aloug nicely toward recovery.

The Traction Engine.
The Gwin Mining Co. has commenced
hauling lumber from Valley Spring to
the mine with its big traction engine.
The engine started up this .week on
Wednesday, and has caused some con
sternation among the horses along the
road,. Tho Gwin people though take
uvory precaution to avoid accidents.
They send a man on horseback ahead
to warn teamsters, and come to a full
stop on meeting any horses that show
a disposition to be frightened. — Cala

Smallpox Notes.
A family named Clark, living at
Lamb's bridge, on the Latrobe road,
has been quarantined on account of
smallpox. Dr. Gall went there two
weeks ago to look into the nature of
the eruption that had appeared in the
family, and discovered that it was
smallpox. There were several in the
family suffering from it. A strict
quarantine was established, and the
disease has disappeared.
Another case has broken out in the
family of James A. LaugLton, the yicr
tim being a boy of tender ypars.
Also L. Spinetti of Jackson Gate,
was found to be afflicted with this
malady. -The discovery was made a
week ago. The patient is about well
by this time.
Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign.
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. Fop
weak digestion, for defective nourish

Emulsion. It restores tlesh because it
strikes at the cause of the loss.

tunnel run of 125 fees at an expense of
$176.75, or $1.40 per foot. The average
width of the ledge is 18 inches, and it
is approaching t'ue intersection with
the Del Monte ledge. Construction
work in October, $75.
The work on the upraise iv tho west
chute of the old tunnel shows Haltering
results. The ledge at a height of 50
feet came in with v two fool or.' body,
which has widened to rive feel at 79
feet; this ore body is solid quartz, with
several indies of black gouge. The
average value of quartz and gouge is
about $68, by assay tests, the gouge run
ning $120 to ; the ton. The ore body
opened up is quite extensive, and will
keep the mill running for several
months. . All is in readiness for milling',
and the stamps will be dropping,' under
the supervision of our competent mill
man, B. C. O'Neil jr., on Nov. 10.
The Monte Del lead is approaching its
intersection with tho Del Monte, where
exceptional values should bo found.
The cross-cut tunnel is being steadily
advanced, aud the large quantity of
water recently encountered indicates a
near approach to tho second ledge. ■
At a recent meeting of the board of
directors, a proposition was received
from B. C. and C. O'Neil, trustees,
offering to surrender their 25,000 shares
of trustee stock, held as security for
part of the purchase price of the miue,
and place the panic in the treasury for
sale in order to enable them to pros
ecute tlio work with greater vigor.
This proposition, which was accepted
by the board, places the control of
operations at the mine in tho hands of
tho stockholders at large, aud will fur
nish them with the means for rapidly
pushing the work on all lines oi de
velopment. Secretary Geo. I. Wright
is now iv the east on business connected
with this and adjoining properties, and
will, while there, place upon the mar
ket this surrendered trustee stock.

Sudden Death.
: Thomas D.' Valentine, employed at
the Wildman mine in Suiter Ciwk, dieil
in that town on Tuesday last, after a
short illness. I He was seized suddenly
the previous day with v complaint
which was thought to be appendicitis.
Thp medical attendants) realized that,
thfi attack was of the gravest char
acter, and necessitated a surgical opera
tion to afford any hope of relief. The
operation was performed, but too late
to effect a cure. The complaint was a
strangulation of the bowels. The
patient died about 24 hours after the
first serious symptoms appeared. De
ceased was 32 years of age, and highly
respected by all who knew him. He
leaves a young wifo to depiore his un
timely end. The body was forwarded
to San Franoisco on -Wednesday for
interment. . •

These famous pills do not gripe, but
move the bowels gently and easily,

When -things are "the best" they
become "the best selling." Abraham
Hare, a leading druggist of Belleville,
0., writes: "Electric Bittors are the
best selling bitters I have handled in 20
years." You know why? Most dis
eases begin in disorders of stomach,
liver, kidneys, bowels, blood and
nerves. Electric Bitters tone up tho.
stomach, regulates liver, kidneys and
howe'.s, purifies the blood,' strengthens
the nerves, hence cures multitudes of
maladies. It builds up the entire sys
tem. Puts new life and vigor into any
weak, sickly, run-down man or woman.

Astronomy Before Christ.
About 600 B. O. Anaxagoras of lonia
was born. When he "grew up in wis
dom," he was the first to teach the
course and cause of both solar and
lunar eclipses and to give his follow
ers rules whereby they could distin
guish planets from fixed stars. He
was punished for declaring that the
sun was not a god.
A Bee Line.
The directness of the bee's flight is
proverbial. The shortest distance be
tween any two given points is called a
bee line. Many observers think that the
Immense eyes with which the Insect Is
furnished greatly assist, if they do not
entirely account for, the arrowy
straightness of its passage through the
air.

When Jackson Dlnedt
While the dinner hour still clings to
the noontime among country people it
has advanced in the cities until now it
occurs at any time between noon and
midnight And that reminds us, says
the Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser, of
one of the many stories about Colonel
Davy Crockett. While he was a mem
ber of congress and was at his home in
Tennessee some one asked him about
the dinner hour In Washington. He
said the common people ate dinner at
12, the next above them at 1, the mer
chants at 2, the representatives at 8,
the senators at 4, members of the cabi
net at 5 and the vice president at 0.
"But when does the president dine?"
"WUat! Old Hickory?" said Crockett,
anxious to fix a time that would suit
his idea of Jackson's greatness. "WelL
he don't eat till next dayl"
Women In Paris Streets.
It is quite a feature of Paris to see
streams of open carriages, private and
hired, taking folks for an after dinner
drive along the grand boulevards,
which are thronged with promenaders
and groups of people Bitting outside
cafes talking. Now and again a car
riage will stop to deposit its burden In
front of a cafe and return later, either
to this or another to which Its occu
pants have migrated.

He Wouldn't Split.
The tramp in the green goggles stood
before the door.
"Yes,'.' said the housewife kindly;
"you can have a good meal if you split
that wood."
"Madam," said the tramp in a pre
cise grammatical manner, "I was born
and raised In Boston— But stop, shall
I tell you the sad, sad story of my
life?"
"Yes, yes."
"When a youth In Boston, I was dis
inherited for splitting an Infinitive, and
since then (his voice broke) I have
vowed never to split anything, not
even the wood!"
"Sick 'Im, Tige!"— Baltimore Herald.
No Consolation For Cracked China.
How many housekeepers there are
that can sympathize with the old Vir
ginia lady who said to her friend on
finding a treasured old cup cracked by
a careless maid, "I know of nothing to
compare with the affliction of losing
a handsome piece of old china." "Sure
ly," said the friend, "it Is not so bad
as losing one's children." "Yes, it Is,
for when your children die you do
have the consolation of religion, yon
know."

Noah Left the Ark on April 20.
Saturday, April 20, is the day marked
In all ancient calendars as being the
one upon which Noah and his family
quitted the ark after having withstood
the siege of the great deluge. The day
is marked in all ancient calendars, es
pecially British, as egressus Note de
area, the 17th of March, the day upon
which Noah, his family and their great
floating collection of natural history
specimens set sail, being designated In
the same class. of early printed litera
ture as lutroltus Note in area, "the day
of Noah's entrance into the ark." Why
these days were chosen as the ones
upon which the supposed embarkation
and debarkation were made are enig

Instincts That Lead to Death.
Professor Mlvart proved that there
are "Instincts" that lead to death by

used to find a comfortable winter re

with gralnfields. If we shall credit

A MAN'S BLUSHES.
Bo Will Fly the Red Signal Mora
Quickly Than a Woman.
"If there is any one thing that makes
ni'-» want to get up and talk right out
in meeting it Is to "hear It said of a
man that 'he blushes like a woman,' "
said the social philosopher to a repre
sentative of the New York Times.
"How women ever gained the repu
tation of having- run up a corner in
blushes is beyond my comprehension.
The report does her a grave injustice,
for as a matter of fact she not only has
no monopoly in -blushes, but does not
make use of the share that properly
belongs to her. There are some wo
men, of course, who blush if you even
blink an eyelid in their direction, but
ac a general thing men blush much
more readily and more violently than
women.
"This Is not a random statement that
I am making for the purpose of hear
ing myself talk, but a sober deduction
founded on careful observation. For
years I have made it a point to study
the sexes in moments of embarrass
ment, and the statistics I have Jotted
down prove that In nine cases out of
ten the average man will fly the red
signal of distress much more quickly
than the average woman. This holds
goodjn all sorts of situations.
"Crack a joke at a man's expense,
he blushes; ply him with awkward
questions, he blushes; subject him to
some humiliation or let some ludicrous
accident befall him in public, and he
straightway rivals the boiled lobster
in hue. A woman may redden slightly
under the same circumstances, but her
blush *is diluted and perfunctory com
pared with the brilliant, sunlit glow
that suffuses the countenance of man.
"I don't attempt to explain the phe
nomenon—physiologists and moralists
may do that If they can — but merely
give the f.nio iVr what they are worth
in the hope that the next time n story
writer has a crop of blushes to dispose
of he will ring a few changes on the
old phrase that has done duty for gen
erations and say of .the heroine that
she 'blushed like a man.'"
FIRE ALARM BOXES.
The System In New York and How It
Is Operated.
Greater New York is thickly studded
with lamppost flre alarm boxes. The
directions on each box, which is paint
ed red and Is surmounted at night by a
red light, are:
"Turn handle to right until* door
opens; then pull Inside hook once and
shut the door." The opening of the
box rings a large bell in the door,
which alarm is intended to notify any
one in the neighborhood, especially the
nearest policeman, that the box has
ben opened. The policeman will then
make sure that this was not done out
of mischief by some one who wanted to
see the engines arrive or, as recently
happened, by a raw maidservant who
wanted to mail a letter. When the in
side lever is pulled down and let go. It
sets in motion a certain clockwork that
ticks out the number of the box three
times In succession at headquarters In
Sixty-seventh street Not only that
but it makes a record upon a tape,
showing the number of the box and the
exact second at which the lever was
pulled. .
A clerk who sits night and day be
side the headquarters instrument notes
the number and selects from a drawer
a certain. disk which when inserted in
the proper apparatus causes the alarm
to be rung in the station houses of the
district in which that firebox is situat
ed. The average time required to se
lect this disk and send out the alarm is
ten seconds. There are always two
clerks and sometimes three in this de
partment Not a word is spoken. An
outsider would hardly know that an
alarm is going out. In order to prevent
several alarms coming at the same
time from people who see the same fire
and run to different boxes no two
neighboring boxes are on the same cir
cuit—Scrlbner's.
Who Told the Flbt
The bell rang, and the occupier of
the apartment started to tho window
to see who the visitor might be. To
his annoyance he saw a persistent
creditor who had evidently called
again fof ' payment of his long out
standing account The Impecunious
one instantly called to his youthful
son and said: ■ *
"Tommy, go to the door at once. I
don't want to see that man. Tell him
I'm not at home."
"Oh, papa, I thought you never told
fibs," remarked Tommy.
"I don't, my boy. It's you that's go-
Ing to tell one. Now run off."— New

FCRCING A FASHION.
Bow Uats -Were Introduced t» tM
South African Savages.
Audrles De Villiers, a Boer, was thft
person who first introduced hats among
til.- South African natives, says the
Hatters' Gazette, and profit- not phi
lanthropy, was his motive. One morn-
Ing many years ago he chanced in Port
Elizabeth to come across a consign
ment of damaged hats offered for a
un re song. He bought the whole lot,
packed them away in his wagon and
started for Kaflirland.
When he reached Tembulaud, he un
loaded his stocl-. aliened his kegs of liq
uor, without which no trade was made
Iv those days, aud began business. But
he found his venture likely to prove an
unprofitable one. The natives did not
want hats. They wanted blankets and
beads and looking glasses ■ and 1 above
nil liquor, but they looked askance at
hats. . Then a bright Idea came to An
dries. He wanted to* lntroduce those
hats, ne did Introduce them. His sim
ple expedient was to refuse to sell any
thing to a Kaffir unless he bought a
hat too. -The Kaffirs wanted his goods,
sathey bought the hats.
When a Kaffir buys anything, he
feels bound to make use of it The na
tives therefore donned their head gear
and returned to their kraals. Now ap
peared the brilliancy of the trader's
Idea. Fashion rules the world. It is as
strong In Africa as in America, and
when those who had stayed at home
saw the travelers return In all the glo
ry of this strange covering they felt
behindhand and old fashioned. Their
desire to possess the latest" thing In
hats became intense. They paid An
dries a visit, and his stock no longer
hung heavy upon his hands. The hats
were soon sold. "
This happened some time ago, and
now every trading store keeps a supply
of hats constantly on hand. They are
said to be manufactured expressly for
the natives, and no one who glances at
the show will doubt It -
A JUGGLER'S TRICK.
CleTer Feat of Illnsion Performed by
an Bast Indian.
The wonderful feats of East Indian
jugglers have formed the theme of
many* a letter from ■ travelers In. the
orient, but none is more* surprising than
that for which an old seadog vouches.
Wlille he was an officer on board a
P. and O. steamship two natives came
aboard at Madras, be says. They were
a juggler and his assistant. After they
had performed ■ a number of minor
feats and gathered ' quite a crowd
around them they called for a sack
and a piece of sailcloth.
These' having been provided, the
chief juggler made a small tentlike
structure with the canvas and some
stools.. He then placed his assistant
in the sack tind allowed a sailor to tie
the knot which bound him a fast pris
oner. This done, the chief carried the
sack into an open space, warning the
people to stand back some distance,
and then carried on an animated con
versatiou with his assistant, whose re
plies could be distinctly beard coming
from the svek. Suddenly the chief
rushed forward, picked up the sack
and dumped it overboard, where, to
the horror of the passengers and crew,
it sank out of sight '
Immediately the captain rushed for
ward and seized the man, under the
full belief 'that he had murdered his
companion, but the juggler only
smiled and, pointing to the canvas,
asked that it be raised. This * was
done, and the supposed drowned man
was discovered squatting on the deck.
So realistic had been the throwing
overboard, however, that it was some
time before the surprised passengers
could realize a murder had not been
committed.
Church and Workmen.
It would be an exaggeration to say
that all working people feel antago
nistic toward the church. Their general
attitude is rather that of indifference.
The thinking poor are well enough
aware that there is nothing unnatural
in the situation and that if the tables
were so turned that world advantage
shifted to their side it would probably
remain unchanged. At times their feel
ing, especially toward the clergy, is cu
riously sympathetic. "Say," remarked
a labor leader of vivid mind to the
writer— "say, I'm awfully sorry for
ministers. Most of them are real good
men. They know well enough what
Christ meant, and they'd like first rate
to preach If they dared. But, liord,
how can they? They've got to draw
their salaries; they've got families to
support" All this quite without a
touch of irony.— Vida D. Scudder la
Atlantic.

country on a visit On her return eihm
urged her mother to let her keep •
cow.
"But, Susie," said the mother, "there
Is no one here to take care of the cow
and milk it"
"Oh, yes. I'll do that, mamma."
"Can you milk a cow? How do yo«
flo it?"
"Oh, I know how. I'll just pull the
pegs out like the man does."—Lippin

A TRUE HERO.
One of the Kind That Gets Little
Recognition Here Below.
Did you ever know a hero real well?
I know at least one and quite intimate
ly. .Who? I am afraid you would hard
ly recognize his name, and besides it
would not be just right to give it here.
He is only nn old bachelor who works
in a shop. lie has been at one bench
for something like— well, from this you
may judge: When he began, he was
fresh from school. He lives in a little
frame house, with an absurd little
back yard hardly more than big enough
for the syringa bush aud the ash bar
rel. .
"The Qrst morning I started for the
shop," he once told me, "I cut across
the back yard and climbed the fence.
I have been doing It ever since, and it
has been a long tlnie." In the tiny
lawn is worn a deep footpath. The top
rail of the back fence is smoothly pol
ished. His feet wore the path. His
hands polished the rail. And all these
years he has worked at the same
bench, doing the same work.
Not that he lacks Intelligence or that
he never had an ambition. Intelligence
he most certainly has, no mean lore of
books and a wide, generous grasp of
affairs and the drift of things. Ambi
tion he had, too, but that was before
his • feet had worn' a path across the
back yard. I am quite sure that he
once loved. In fact, I suspect that I
know the one he loved,' and that she
loved him. | But he never married. She
did, though she has been widowed for
a dozen years.
■ But why, you ask, with intelligence
and ambition, did he stick to his
bench? In an upper room of his little
cottage Is a' window blind which is
never opened. Behind that blind, peer
ing out through the shutters with on
recognizing gaze, sits one who bears
the outward form of manhood, yet
lacks manhood's mental qualities. The
one behind the blind is his brother.
Downstairs, puttering feebty about and
speaking only in high, thin, querulous
tones, is a wan and bent old woman—
his mother. For the sake of these two
he has worn the path in the lawn; for
them he put away ambition; for them
he stifled the love that once stored
within him. *
He is past middle age now, thin as to
hair, stooped as to shoulders. Yet is
there a tenderness in his voice, a cheer
ful sweetness In his smile, a patient
resignation in his pale blue eyes, that
make his manner of such mild gentle
ness as you might expect in a saint
From him comes never a word of com
plaint; about him is no trace of dis
appointment, no hint of bitterness.
And so, though few know his name,
though he wears no glittering gauds,
though he goes his way unhampered
by pomp or circumstance and all un
recognized by church or state, I can
not help but count him one of earth's
true heroes. Don't you?— Sewell Ford
in Brandur Magazine. :
Moses and His Horns.
Did Moses have horns? Certainly
not, but if you have ever had the
pleasure of examining a copy of Mi
chael Angelo's great picture of "The
Lawgiver" you have wondered why
the groat painter surmounted the pa
triarchal face, gray beard and becom
ing priestly gown with a pair of horns
much resembling those of a two-year
old animal of the bovine tribe. The
reason Is this: Jerome's Bible, the
Latin Vulgate, tells that when Moses
came down from the mountain top his
face was "radiant" (rayed) with the
great light shining from his pure soul.
In the Greek Septuagint the transla
tion said it was "cornua," meaning
"radiant" Jerome used this later ver
sion in making his Latin Vulgate and
translated "cornua" as "cornuta," the
last meaning horned. Angelo made
his picture accordingly.
Soil Is a Living Organism.
Formerly the soil was regarded as
mineral matter, simply decayed rock
mixed with dead organic matter, says
an exchange. Now we know that the
soil is a living organism whose life
Is as important as that of the animal
or the plant itself. If the soil be killed,
it Is absolutely sterile. In other words.
If the life of organisms which make
soil fertile are destroyed the soil is
Incapable of producing a crop. Plants,
as a rule, eat only mineral food, such
as phosphoric acid, potash and nitric
acid, but animals usually eat only or
ganic foods, such as fats, sugars and
protein matter.
Ills Case Not So Bad After All.
"Ah, It's a sad old world," sighed the
man who had been cheated out of $20.
"Tes," assented, his neighbor. "One
of my horses got his head fast In the
hayrack last night and broke his neck.
I was offered $200 for him less than a
month ago."
"Pshaw! That's too bad. Looks as
though It was going to brighten up,
doesn't It?" And he .went on his way
whistling cheerfully.- T Chlcago Record-
