remarked, "Rather a" small model. Miss

One advantage accrues to the respec
table member of the community from
the minuteness with "which the Dres
den police look Into the affairs of every
Inhabitant of the city. If he Is a care
ful man 'and always carries papers
which may serve to establish his iden
tity he Is practically Immune from the
huliguity of being arrested and march-
Xl off to the police station unless, ln
ileed, he commits some especially hei
nous crime. Does be drive faster than
the law permits, does he cross a bridge
on the left hand side, he is stopped by
the guardian of law and order and re
quested to'give'hls name. <lf he has
his papers with him thf policeman may
then and there Impose a fine of from
1 to 8 marks. If then he admits that
he is in the wrong and pays the fine
the Incident is closed.' If, however, he
wishes to appeal from the policeman's
"Vlecislon lie; may "da »o. ; < Even In that
case he ' is not arrested, but a . day or
two , later he is notified ] to appear in
court and answer to the charge against
him. But then If he is found guilty
the lowest fine that can be Imposed
is 3 marks. That this custom of per
mitting the policeman personally to im
pose small fines is little understood by
foreigners is shown by a remark made
to me by a gentleman who bad lived
In Germany the greater part of his life
and in Dresdoa for a number of years.

The Tailor Bird.
The brilliantly plumed birds of "the
tropical forests are exposed to many
dangers, and if they were not gifted
with peculiar yet useful instincts they
would fall ready victims to their ene
mies' Chattering . monkeys and big
snakes steal and eat their eggs, while
their offspring are preyed upon . by
foes on every side. But it takes a sly
monkey o* snake to 'get ahead of the
tailor bird, a small East Indian sing
ing bird. She hides her nest so skill
fully that her enemies cannot find it
no matter how hard they try. This
she does by using .her long, slender
bill as a needle. : With the tough fiber
of a parasite plant abundant - in—the
tropics as a thread she sews a dead
leaf . taken from the ground to a liv
ing one near the end of a slender and
hanging branch, and between these
leaves she builds her nest, where nei
ther monkey nor snake can approach,
because the branch will not bear their
weight.
The First Lexicographer.
Dr. Johnson, even if we except his
predecessor, Bailey, was not the father
of lexicographers. In a volume issued
by the historical manuscripts commis
sion on manuscripts In the Welsh lan
guage it is stated that the idea of illus
trating the meaning and correct use of
words by "actual quotations from the
literature of a living language seems to
have been first put in practice by Grif
fith Hlraethog, the herald bard- of
Wales, who died In 1564.' It was not
till the days of Dr. Johnson, 200 years
later, that a similar Idea took root in
English soil. An abbreviated copy of
Griffith Hlraethog's Welsh Dictionary
was made by his pupil,' William* Llyn,
between 1507 and 1578 and is now in
the free library at Cardiff.— London

Growth of the Human Heart.
A scientific analysis of the growth of
the human heart demonstrates the fact
that the increase is greatest and -.most
rapid during the first and second years
of life, its bulk at the end of the sec
ond year being exactly double what It
originally was. . Between the second
and seventh "years it is again doubled
In size. A slower rate of growth then
sets in and continues during the period
of maturity of other portions of the
body. After the fifteenth year up to
the fiftieth the annual growth of the
heart is -about .001 of a cubic inch,
the Increase ceasing about the fiftieth
year.
The -Delate*.
In answer to a correspondent a news
paper snys: "The deluge mentioned In
the Bible was' threatened in the year
175G B. C. and began on Dec. 7, ICSC
B. C, and continued 377 days. The ark
rested on Mount Ararat on May 0,
1055, but Noah did not leave it until
Dec. 18 following." Any reader who
imagines that it would be an easy task
to figure* these details from a Biblical
account can find a basis for his calcu

A boy was charged at a London po
lice court the other day. with blowing
a whistle in such a way as to cause
three policemen to come toward him.
The fact that such a thing is possible
suggests the questions: How do" the
police distinguish between a cab whis
tle and a police whistle? ; What Is there
to" prevent any,, one from: blowing; a
whistle in such a way as to call a po
liceman? ■-■-.'
:' : A. representative of the Graphic who
put these' questions to a high official
of the city police learned that in the
matter of attending to whistles, as with
his many other duties, the policeman
uses his discretion. Any shrill whistle
will attract ' a . policeman, but . such j a
, whistle blown at night outside 1 a res
taurant or any place where people con
gregate and cabs are wanted would hot
bring a policeman to" the whistler/ The,
same whistle blown in precisely ' the'
same way in the middle of the city at
midday would bring a policeman on
the scene at once. — London Graphic. '.
Lakes of Blood.
The name Lake of Blood or its equiv
alent has been given to' places as far
apart as England and South America.
; "Sanguelae"— i. c., the Lake of Blood
.. — was the name given by the victo
rious Normans to the battlefield at Hast
ings, where the jj Saxons were over
thrown and slain with terrible carnage.
For a similar reason Lake Trasimene
has borne the name "Sanginetto" be
cause its waters were reddened during
the second Punic war by the blood of
some 15,000 Romans who fell before
the troops of Hannibal. , v
Yet another Lake of Blood, - called
also "Yaguar Cocha," is situated in
the state of Ecuador: It is one of a
series of lakes formed by the extinct
craters of volcanoes on the towering
heights of the Andes range, of moun

afterward the Americans turned on the
English and, with the aid of France,
ejected them. In 1812 we again fought
the English !tb defend , the national

from Mexico by the sword. To consoli

FRIDAY DECEMBER 18, 1903
EDITORIAL PERILS.
The prevailing idea that an editor
and publisher, is such, can be held
criminally responsible only for the
appearance in the columns of hjs
paper of a malicious and libelous
article, must be revised, according
to the march of events in Amador
county within the past two weeks.
Newspaper men throughout the
state will do well to take heed to the
new legal- snags which have been
planted for their particular benefit,
and which their enemies may use in
an emergency for their undoing. A
country editor without enemies is a
man who is without convictions, or
who lacks the courage to express
them. One who tries to do his duty
is bound to have a few evil-wishers
ou the alert to entrap him on any
flimsy pretext that may present it
self. This may be taken as a com
pliment, and almost invariably does
work to his advantage in the long
run; all the same it is a source of
annoyance and expense for the time
being. The powers that be iv Ama
dor county have laid down the
principle that any item published in
a newspaper, whether on personal
knowledge or on second-hand infor
mation, has all the force of a sworn
statement, as far as the responsibili
ty of the editor is concerned. A
copy of the paper itself containing
the article, can thereafter be made
to do duty in a criminal prosecu
tion, in lieu of the corpus delicti;
also as absolute proof of the identity
of the writer, and conclusive evi
dence of the truth of the statements
contained therein. This far-reaching
legal effect of a news item is a phase
of journalism never before contem
plated. If universally adopted it
would be a bombshell in the ranks of
the fraternity never before exploded
in this country since the declaration
of independence. Such is journal
istic life in the far west, as practi
cally exemplified in Amador county.
This is about the funniest proposi
tion of the legion of funny happen
ings in local jurisprudence in many
years. The deer case in its other
phases will come within the purview
of the press shortly. At present it
would be out of place to discuss it,
but we have no doubt it is, in its
many-sided features, commanding a
full share of public discussion
throughout the county.
CHANGE OF POLICY.
A sudden and ' radical change or
policy affecting the revenue or social
status of county, state or nation, is
to be deprecated.' The ..country at
large has been discussing for several
years past the advisability of modi
fying the tariff laws. It is admitted
that such laws need changing from
time to time to meet the require
ments of changing circumstances.
A tariff schedule, wisely arranged
and beneficent iv its operation to
day, may be out of joint and op
pressive in the altered conditions of
a year hence. This is admitted.
There is no fixity of such laws that
will apply with equal force to all pos
sible conditions. They: are merely
temporary policies, intended to ap
ply to certain conditions; when the
conditions change,^- a revision or
modification of the policy becomes
imperative. But even when this
necessity arises, it is the path of
wisdom to avoid - any sweeping
change. To avert a violent disturb
ance of financial affairs, the modifi
cation must be gradually and almost
imperceptibly -, accomplished. The
country passes from the old to the
new order of things without serious
detriment to any material interest.
When the democrats succeeded in
electing a president and congress, a
radical departure in fiscal policy was
inaugurated. From a high protect
ive tariff, the administration pro
posed to drift to tariff for revenue
only, withdrawing the protective
feature under which many infant in
dustries were struggling to a sound
bash. We know the result. A panic
and financial crash spread through
the country. The threatened in
terests, in seeking cover, went tot
tering to the wall. Years of fam
ished industries and hard times, for
the laboring classes intervened, and
continued until the jj policy of pro
tection was again triumphant at the
polls. . .; . . .
The idea herein conveyed of dis
aster incident to a violent change of
policy, is applicable to county af
fairs. • A movement is on foot to
make a sweeping change in local
policy. The movement, we doubt
not, .is prompted by the, best p of
motives. It' aims to promote J the
moral and, material welfare/ of^the
county. >The object is to control the
number of saloons. ,No one*will dis
pute that' the number ' is ' f«r in ex
cess of a reasonablejimit. .The sys
tem has grown up, however, under
the fostering care of the local gov
ernment. ■ It is the outcome of a low
license system which has always held
sway ...'No doubt it would have been
better- if a different policy had, been
adopted at the outset/ But the dif
ficulty now facing us, is how to
remedy the evil' without' bringing
upon the community other evils, per
haps. not 1 one whit less disastrous
than those now existing. It is well
to consider the matter, in all its
bearings before taking acfton. What
would be the probable effect if a
sharp turn were taken? How would
property, interests f be affected?
What might happen in'; the; way of
the principal^ towns Cof the county
adopting self government, thereby
taking. the regulation of such mat
ters out of the hands of the county
authorities? If this. were done, how
would it affect . the income for the
support of the county organization
While recognizing, therefore, the
need of reform, it behooves those in
charge to make haste slowly, taking
a broadside view 5f the situation
before moving at all. j
The strike at the Royal mine at
Hodson, in Calaveras county, has
assumed a threatening aspect.' The
strikers have resorted to violence, to
prevent non-union men from taking
the places they have vacated. This
is the last resort, when the contest
from the strikers' standpoint is mov
ing onward to a losing game. And
yet in adopting violent methods they
ought to know that they are only
contributing to their own defeat.'
Labor unions cannot win by declar
ing war against law and order. The
same tactics have been followed in
Colorado, and while that hitherto
flourishing state has ' been, sadly
crippled industrially by the strife,
the labor organizations have been the
principal sufferers. They are strong
when they keep within legitimate
lines; ihey are weakness itself when
they defy established authority. :

One Minute Couch Cure gives immed
iate relief in all cases of Cough, Croup
and LaGrippe because it does not pass
immediately into the stomach, but
takes effect right at the seat of the
trouble. It draws out the inflamma
tion, heals and soothes and cures per
manently by enabling the lungs' to con
tribute pure live-giving and lire-sus
taining oxygen to the blood and tissues.

THE AIvrADOR LEDGER: JACKSOK, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. 18, 1903.
FEOM; ALASKA.
'. Rampart, 'Alaska, Oct. 10, 1903
Neglected but not forgotten Ledger:—
The prospecting season being over
foi^tbis year, you may expect. to hear
from me twice a mouth, ■ unless ordered
to the contrary: At the end of my last
letter we were at White Horse, Y. T.j
ready to start down the river.-: June
18th, having stowed our goods in the
barge, aud domicilod tho two : cows in
their small but ulegant statoroom, a
little .'.'abaft of amidships" we all j went
on board.'and an obliging frieiid throw
off the lino. Our party was composed
of 10 persons, two miners bound- for
-Oiiwson, a womaiTwith her mother and
daughter going to Rampart, a Swede
woman who was taking twe inilcli cows
to the interior, a photographer and two
doctors, one with' his i) year old son.. lt
was just 7 in the evening as wo j drifted
past the town of White Horse, one of
our party playing a banjo, friends on
the bank waving goodbye, tourists on
the docks of two steamurs about to
start for Dawson, regarding us with
looks of interest, whotbor of pity or
derision 'wo worried not. Our barge
was 9 foot- wide and 30 foot long, with
five footoulriggers»»for a groat oar,
called a swoop at each end, makin" the
whole length 40 feet, and fitted with a
24 foot mast carrying a sail 12 by 18
feet. The current was about 4 miles
an hour, and" very little work was nec
essary to keep the channel; the even
ing was such as only Alaskan summers
furnish, the sun did not set till after 9,
and it was past midnight before any one
felt like going to sleep. Wo had plenty
of provisions and bedding, and by being
good natured, plenty of room. Two
remained awake to steer the barge, but
the work was easy and full of "interest.
Fifteen miles below White Horse we
passed tho mouth of the Tahkina, a
stream entering Fifty Mile river from
the west, and large enough for steam
boats. From here to the head of Lake
Lebarge, 13 miles, the current is less
than two miles an hour, and it was 6 in
the morning when we reached the jetty
built by the Canadian government, to
make a channel deep enough forsteam
ers, through the shoals at the head of
the lake. ; This was done two years
ago at a heavy expense. Thoengineers
in their excess of wisdom, made a new
channel for the jetty, which the water
refused to follow, but broke the barrier
and continued the old course, which
the steamers are now obliged to take,
and have more trouble than before. the
improvements were made. The.' wind
was blowing from the north, so *c tied
up and spent the -day hunting rabbits
and watching the two steamers that
had loft White Horse the evening; be
fore, and were stuck on sand bars near
by. . The mud was too soft to give any
support to the steam levers with. which
all river boats are provided, and the
only practical resource left was tho free
use of, energetic and intensely blas
phemous language.- In the afternoon
a boat from Dawson arrived, and at
taching a cable to the stranded boat,
and putting all engines under full
steam, soon cleared the bar. - About
4 o'clock the wind began to change to
the south, so we drifted down the chan
nel and out into the lake, which is 32
miles long and from 4 to 10 miles wide.
Soon a smart breeze favored us, and
the sail carried us at a good rate for a
couple of hours, when the wind changed
again and a thunder-storm drove down
from the north. > We succeeded in
reaching a 6inall cove on the east side
of the lake, and as the wind continued
after the rain had passed, we wont
ashore, built a great fire of drift wood,
dried oursolves, and tried to imagine
how Eneas and his followers felt after
their shipwreck. The women were
comfortable under a tarpaulin on board
the barge. It was 4 the next after
noon before tho lake was calm enough
to venture further, but we feasted on
rabbits and milk, and wore happy.
The wind being contrary wo kept close
to the shore, two men walking alon"
the beach and pulling a line, while the
others stayed on board, and with' long
poles pushed the craft forward. About
midnight we were all tirod, and went
to sleep. The next day a strong breeze
from the south favorod us, and we set
the sail. The wind increased and wo
made splendid time, but a few miles
from the foot of the lake we were driven
back by another thunderstorm and had
to run ashore again. On the evening
of the fourth day on the lake we reach
ed its foot, ' and wore drawn into the
head of Thirty Mile river as though
there was no such thing as delay. The
places where I had been stranded or
wrecked three years . ago seemed like
old acquaintances, but not dear enough
to merit a call. Our craft was so easily
managed that the 18 miles of rapids
were almost like shooting the chutes
At 11 we called at Hootalinqua, and
learned that some idiot had reported
that wo were all drowned. Wo sent a
message to our friends in Skigway, Ss
suring thorn, a la Mark Twain, that
the reports of our death had boon
greatly exaggerated, and on* we went..
For a gigantic picnic this sort of a trip
cannot bo surpassed. The rapida of
Five Fingers, Rink and Hell Gate, wore
just exciting enough to be interesting,
nothing more. Our only accident oc
curred when rounding a bend in the
Lewes river. An overhanging tree
caught out mast, but the stout fir stick
was so strong it stopped tho boat. One
man was knocked off the upper deck
and somewhat bruised, one woman
sprained her ankle in trying to get out
of his way, and a stove was swept off
into the river, whore it still remains.
We made no stop at Selkirk or Ogllvie,
and arrived at Dawson on the morninff
of the 26th..- ,

StriVe Off at South Eureka-
The strike- at the-" South' Eureka,
which has been on for several ' weeks,
was declared off last Tuesday 'by "the
Suiter Crtii'k Miners ' Union. It lasted
just four; weeks, during which time
nothing but the hoisting of water 'has
been done. 'The terms upon which the
strike was terminated were satisfactory
aU round. The two men, whose re
instatement the union insisted upon in
the first place,' and which precipitated
the trouble, announced that .they did
not want, to return to work.;". - w Tbiß
paved the w>y to an understanding, as
the company never had , any.> objection
toihe return '>. of > the other employes.
So the men applied for work £ Wednes
day morning, and. operations were re
sumed. Many of tho old hands had left
for other parts, or had secured employ
ment elsewhere. There was no trouble
about getting men. Indeed, there were
more applications than they had places
to fill, as there - has . been an influx of
miners to this ' section from Colorado
and other labor troubled states. * This
settlement of the strike is hailed -with
pleasure throughout the county;*" It
will tend to : re-establish confidence
among mining investors, as showing
that the unions realize that radical
measures will not be tolerated; .. that a
conservative and conciliatory course,
recognizing : to the .fullest exteut the
right of employers to take on or.' dis
charge men without dictation from any
source, is tbe only safe path to pursue.
Tax Payments. 'X.
. The payment of tlie first instalment
of state and county taxes for the cur
rent year is above the average. .While
all the townships show up exceedingly
well, township two is entitled to .the
banner for the smallness of Its delin
quent list. The sum of $14,417.59 has
been received from that section,
through J. W. Surface &. Son. This
includes $3146 received on account of
the special high school tax. This tax
is all due on payment of the first in
stalment. ; The semi-annual payment
feature does not apply to special school
taxes. Not more than $300 remains
outstanding on this high school tax.'
This is a trifle less than 10 per cent of
the whole amount, and is a flattering
shpwing at this stage of lax collodions.'
Notwithstanding the.: heavy lax- rate,
the eollijivilous show up above the aver
age throughout the I county,- and the
outlook is favorable for a much lower
rate nnxt year on account of tho heavy
payments made on the reilomption of
delinquent property. . Tim amount re
ceived from this source is far in excess
of the aggregate amount received ; dur
ing a.l the ; preceding years since the
present law went into effect. ?*!..,.? * ! .. ,. .; .

->■.:.-';.'': -;.;>S reeln . ent - ; - -f. XX : '
The weighty case of people vs. Rich
ard Webb accused .of having deer meat
in his possession in -closed .season,, was
heard before Justice Goldner on . Mon
day last. v-The • trial ..-was- held ■ in ; the
supervisor's room in the hall of records,
as the interest taken in the proceedings
was such that the usual' justice* court
room was '■ too ' contracted* to'accom
modate the spectators. •";' A' r yenue was
issued for 30 jurors." .The entire . mor/n
ing session was occupied in securing! a
jury.;. ' Finally ; the following named
twelve. men were sworn to try the case;
Geo.; Kirk wood, P. ;L. Cassinelli, A.
HamrfcW, W.E:;Speer,;T,' Schwartz,
A.' H: Kuhlman; W/ E." Kent," R: W.
Ketcham, J. Wilson, J. D. Mason,' and
F. Burgin. " .
..The district attorney, C. P.'Vicini,
was on hand to conduct the prosecu
tion,' and C.- H. Crocker appeared for
the defendant. The proceedings "wore
of tho most farcical nature, i" Probably
never in the history of Amador county
—and we believe the remark will apply
to the state— wassuch a case yen til a ted
before a jury! or. 'the rules of evidence
cast aside with such scant considera
tion, t Not onco ' in v the . course , of the^
whole trial was an objection to tbo in
trodudtiod of testimony as -irrelevant,
made in behalf of 'the defendant, sus
tained by tbe'eourt. '. Everything tveut
in. [We may hereafter comment upoc
some of the . features of r this remark
able case — remarkable . in .more., ways
than one— but for the present we- shall
content ourselves with a brief narration
of thVTacts. :••■..*-• j v. ..-
L. N.. Kercheval, a state deputy, was
the Best witness. ;: He, it was who swore
to the complaint, and made the arre-t.
He traveled 200 miles for this purpose.
And he swore to the complaint | not, on
information, but of his own knowledge.
The complaint charged that defendant
had deer meat in his possession on or
about the 20th of November/.?? Jn'testi
fying, however, v he admitted that' he
never saw the defendant until' the" 4thi
of December when he made, the arrest.
That all he knew was what , he saw in
the Amador Ledger of , Nov. 27. •He
first saw the paper {n the -office of, C.
Vogelsang," the: chief ; deputy,'; in" San
Francisco. SHe never* saw' any 'deer
meat in defendant's possession,' and did
not know whether he ever had any 5 or
not. 7 He was not.undor, bonds. :w;
O. H. Reichling; was^ the next wit
ness. ■, He said, ho; went to tho ranch of
A. Jones, a couple of miles west of Pine
Grove, in company with C- B. Arditto,
the local game warden. 'He was secre
tary of the Jackson ! game association,
and also deputy game warden tinder
Arditto. When asked to detail a "con
versation he hacLwith A. "Jones, Wie de
fense interposed an objection that such
was ■ iuadmissable, .unless it . was . first
shown that tbe defendant was present.
It is a well-settled principle of law. that
a defendant could * not be bound by
statements of other parties made not in
his presence. The objection was brush
ed aside without ceremony. . He then
said that Jones told lain that ho tpok
a piece of venison to Jackson, and left
it with ; Mrs. Webb. 'That he saw > Mr.
Webb afterwards and told- him about
it; that ho had killed 'the* deer on 'the
28th of Octobor. That he had 'omitted
to tell Mr. Webb tiot to _say anything
in the paper about it. . Witness never
saw deer meat in the possession of,de
fendant: ' ' -. ,:;-, >:-■..;.,,•
J. S. Garbarini was I next examined.
He said he had a conversation with de
fendant on the evening of Nov. 27, at
his living rooms.' Mrs.'- Webb \yas~presr
ent. He started to josh about the arti
cle In the Ledger. "Wanted. to know if
it was put in to tost tho game associa
tion. He said *it was not. -■ It was | a
simple mistake on his part as ■ to . when
the deer was killed; he 'had no doubt
that the animal was' kl\Jed io tho open
season,. and ho neglected to look at the
law as to when the open .season ended..
Mrs. Webb spoke up and said that she
received a parcel from Mr. Jones; that
she did not ask any questions,' and did
not know what \V was; that she was
sorry on Mr. Jones' account.'- Never
saw any " venison in possession \of de
fendant. ," . '. \.; .' .."..'!
.A copy .of I the Ledger of November
27th, containing the five or six line
article r acknowledging the receipt by
tha Ledger .office of a sample of
venison, was 'thereupon -admitted .in
evidence, against the objections of de
fense. 1 This w'Ss the only, material ob
ject introduced in (evidence during the
trial.' It had to do service as occular
demonstration that a deer was actually
killed, and also that the defendant had
received a portion of it. :: . ;
. C. B. Arditto then related his story.
He is game warden of Amador county,
and a deputy under the state ■ board.
He gave a somewhat different* version
of the ; conversation^ith !A. Jones:
He said Mr. Jones tokrthem he had de
livered a piece of venison at the Led
ger office to Mrs! Webb, for Mr. Webb.
That he afterwards met the defendant
on the street and told him about leav
ing it, and also told him the deer
weighed over 100 pounds; Left some
for him last year, but he did not pub
lish it. He had . never seen any deer
meat in defendant's possession, and did
not know whether he had any or- not.
This closed the case fqr the- prosecu
tion. - Mr. Crocker addressed the court,
and asked that the court instruct tho
jury to give a verdict of acquittal. The
prosecution had utterly failed to make*
out a prima <facie ■case. ; The corpus
delicti had not- been established. No
deer meat nor vestige of deer had been
produced, or traced to the defendant
or any one else. From beginning to
end it was nothing but a tissue of
hearsay testimony. The court of course
denied the motion.
The defense then put. In some testi
mony. Mrs. Webb, wife oi defendant,
took the stand, and stated that A.
Jones called on tho 21st of November,"
(not the 20th as named in the com
plaint) and left a parcel, saying, ''Here's
something for you and -Mr." Webb."
He did not mention venison, and of her
own knowledge she could not tell what
it was. The defendant never bad it in
his possession; never saw it, and neve?
partook of any,' On tho following day
in tho afternoon she cook-yl ; the ' meat,"
tbe defendant twingf absent, and' r par
took of a small pioce, in'rtcognition of
tho kindness of thiv donor, and know
ing 'that defendant 'did not care for
such delicacy,' she ciit up the real of it
and fed it to seven, cats. * She supposed'
it was venison. .
" The defendant Jtook' the stand, and
testified that at no time was he in pos
session of any deer.' meat.*- The; parcel
was never delivered to .him; he never
saw it opened or unopened; of his own
knowledge he coiild notr ; tell that any
venispn had been received "by anyone
connected witVthe Ledger; he could
not tell deer, meat ~ from bear meat or
any other, kind of meat. '.The article
in the Lodger was based entirely on
hearsay — statements made by others —
like the vast majority of news items.
The item itself did not say that the
editor received any venison. He had
never admitted to any one that he had
received deer meat, lie did not know
what became of it, except what he had
been told .
Th»» <^-'- : ct attorney tried to make

MINING NOTES.
 Bunker Hill.— The 40-stamp . mill
is being pushed tv completion: with- all
possible speed, f onsistont with thorough
work. It Is expected to have tbe mill
ready to start about the first of Feb
ruary.
Oneida. — This, mine .coutiDues at
tbe same satisfactory pace it has main
tained for some montbs past. . Much of
the ore is taken from below 2000 feel.
A winze is being sunk from the 2000 to
the 2200 feet. The mill is crushing the
usual quota of , rock, : 'and everything
about the works indicates a prosperous
and well-managed mine. :
,-S Argonaut. — The repairs of the
Argonaut shaft are down . close to the
water line, about the 1600 level. It is
not the intention we understand to un
water the shaft entirely, but only so
much as is necessary to enable tho two
lower levels at 1400 and 16Q0 feet to be
worked. The shaft work may bo said
to be nearly completed. : There will no
doubt be considerable ;>' work -in - the
levels before the milling of ore can be
started.
; Kennedy. — Everything . is running
smoothly at this mine.'. The new hoist
is i .now .working, satisfactorily. The
expert machinist, representing the
builders, AHis, : Chalmers &. Co.", of
Chicago, Is still on the ground,' making
needed changes to ensure the highest
efficiency. Some trouble was experi
enced on account of the \ uneven wind
ing of tbe cable around the cylinder.
This has been fixed,". and , everything
seems to be running as smoothly and
evenly as could be wished.
Valparaiso. —At this property,
which lies north of the Mammoth mine,
near Middle Bar, . Ross Morgan has
been surveying for the past two months.
The mine itself is a patented claim, but
there is neither dumping > room nor
ground for a mill in connection with it.
A small irregular piece of land, thrown
out in the. ; mineral • surveys of all the
neighboring claims,' was left at the out
let of the Valparaiso tunnel. It is this
ground that has just been surveyed for
a mill site. It is the intention to apply
for a patent. V Tbe company ; will then
be in a position to work the property
to advantage. It has been operated on
a small scale on lease heretofore. The
lessees followed thel rich stringers. of
black metal, heavily " freighted ; with
gold, and made good wages. But tho
leasing system proved unsatisfactory
to the owners of the property. 'A large
ledge is believed to exist , to the v west,"
and when the title has been perfected
to the strip of unpatented ground, it is
believed that something may be done
toward starting up the mine on a good
working basis. • ->;:;'-..''

, An accident "of a serious character

were returning home in the afternoon,
and _withlnfaVbalfjV!miie of? Jackson
when the unfortunate affair" occurred."
Pietro was ahead? In • descending i'a
hill in this order, Americo slipped; and
his weapon was discharged. . The ; con
tents—a full charge of bird'shot— struck
Pietro in the fleshy part of the left leg,
just below the .hip, making'a severe
wound," from which the blood flowed in
a stream.'*' His cousin took his' shirt off
and w ! tn lt m ade a temporary bandage
to stop the loss of. blood as much as
possible. Young Fortner happened to
be near at the time, and he made haste
to ; got >j doctor."; Dr. Lonigo was
speedily on the ground ; the injured
man was [conveyed \to . town, and the
wound'properly dressed. The wound
is a bad one, and will take some time to
heal. | Had the charge entered a few
inches higher, it would probably have
resulted fatally.' At last; accounts : the
man was doing ; nicely. His complete
recovery is only a question of time.

A ROYAL BOOK BUYER.
The : Purchase of 'Diderot's ' Library
by Catherine 11. of Russia.
Empress Catherine 11. of Russia was
a great reader "and a lover of books.
One of her services to letters in Russia
was the purchase . of the libraries of
Voltaire and Diderot. She was a warm
friend' and 'admirer of these French
philosophers, "and their work interested
her because, she was eager to learn new
theories of politics' and government
Voltaire's library . of about 7,000 vol
umes Is now a part of the Russian im
perlal library in the Hermitage palace
and In the hall devoted to it is Hou
don's statue of Voltaire.
The story of Catherine's purchase o>
Diderot's library is interesting, r It i»
creditable to her tact and her generos
Ity. Diderot named £15,000 as , th«
price of . his library. Catherine 11.-.of
fered him £10,000 and named as a con
ditlon of the bargain that her purchasi
should remain with Diderot until . hit
death.' Thus Diderot, without leaving
Paris, became Catherine's librarian ii
his own -library. v As her librarian b<
was given a yearly salary of V. f KXJ.
One year this salary was no,, paid
Then Catherine wrote to her librariat
that she could not have him or her li
brary suffer through the negligence "ol
a treasurer's clerk and that she should
send i him the sum that she had sel

The Literary Chap In Finance.
"I know a literary chap, good writer
and all that, but . with j absolutely ' no
business sense, who suddenly decided
the thing for him to do was to start a
bank account*" said the secretary of a
financial institution. ' "He came in to
see me about it. I asked ' him how
much he had, and he sold he had saved
$59. I told him 'we rarely started ac
counts on', such small deposits, but
would make an exception in his case
to encourage thrift and school him in
business. V: •-.'■-- ■ .- ■ . -
. "He went through the preliminaries
nervously, , signed the signature card,
put his money. in and got a nice_new
bank book. By, that time he was all
flustered. They gave him a^fck book,
and he decided he»would have to have
some money for present use. The re
ceiving, teller Introduced him to the
rpaying -teller, and -he Inquired, the
procedure of checking out money. The
paying teller explained at length. Then
my literary friend went over' to. the
desk and wrote a check for his entire
$59, got the money and went out."

Dog and Cat.
The effect of a dog on a cat's tail is
well worth. study. When a cat encoun
ters a strange dog the tail immediately
assumes an upright position, the back
becomes highly ; arched, and the . fur
stands out straight all over the body.
This sudden change dismays the dog,
who brings himself to a halt, and the
two regard each other steadfastly. : .
But if the dog should turn his gaze
away for a fraction of a sqf ond there is
a swish and a bound, and the cat lias
disappeared over a fence or up a tree.
Stimulated by the presence of a dog,
/cats have been known to climb to such
heights'- that they were unable to de
scend the way they went up.

A DOG OF UTILITY.
The Pointer's, Evolution . From the
.' Bloodhound Type. :"
:•; The evolution of the pointer, from
what may be described as , the . blood
hound type to the modern English
foxhound kind has • taken, perhnps,
close on 150 years. He is essentially,
above all others, a dog of utility * and
as the pointer has always been looked
upon as one of the chief helpmates of
Che man who loves to take his pleasure
behind a well broken brace of dogs, a
pair of barrels and straight powder, lit
mauds to reason that that man has
called in all his Ingenuity and all his
knowledge of breeding to provide him-:
self with a sporting dog that is best
adapted for the sport that is provided
for him. Therefore in some places in
America, where the plains are so vast
a very fast and wide ranging pointer
Is required— one, too, with "bird sense."
Where true ranging, a good nose and
stanchness on ' game are to be found
embodied in one single dog,' there, per
haps, have we found the perfect ani
mal, and a retrieving pointer at that.
! As in other breeds of dogs, there are
all 'Sizes and sorts of pointers. The
short headed, , cloddy ; shouldered and
often weak thlghcd and cow hocked
pointer has gone by the board. It
stands to reason that, although the
cart horse can gallop, he cannot gallop
with the thoroughbred, the clean neck
ed,'oblique shouldered, deep hammed,
live racing machine. ■ - Half . a day of
real . going will knock ■up the | heavy
headed,- loose throated pointer. . He has
had to give way to the more elegant
quantity; but even such as he should
not be too small.— lllustrated Sporting
News/v ,- , Sig&Msl

The leaves of a green plant are chief
ly useful as feeding organs, which util
ize'sunlight in building-up plant sub
stance from water, carbonic add gas
and simple salts. Deciduous forms and
evergreens have been evolved on dif
ferent lines as regards foliage.
On the approach of autumn the for
mer withdraw all nutritious substances
Into their trunks and branches. A layer
of cork Is then developed across the
base, of -each leal .which afterward
falls off, leaving a neatly covered scar,
which excludes air and germs.,- '- ' .
These changes do not take place in
evergreens, for these possess tough,
leathery leaves capable of ; resisting
frost, which are shed gradually all the
year round as they become old and ef
fete. Such plants use | sunlight | year
out, year in, while deciduous trees and
shrubs ; do . during ; the warm season
only, though they work very vigorous
ly in summer, getting ready 'the buds
which open the next spring and stor
ing up starch and the like to serve as
food till the new leaves are unfolded
and ready for work. ;
On the Wrong Tack.
A young man In New York was deep
ly Impressed with the beauties of Free
masonry and after considerable effort,
mental ; and otherwise, had fitted him
self for the ceremony of initiation into
the order, r He had heard of the "goat"
and the "gridiron" : and many other
things connected with the first degree
and was prepared to be surprised at
nothing. . In the course of his first even
ing at the lodge he stepped on a tack,
which stuck Into his foot and gave him
considerable pain. lie said ' nothing
niul made no effort to remove it, pain
ful though It' was.'' "Two* hours later,
when It swmed to him that there was
nothing more to come in . the way of
initiation, 1 he nsked if he might tnke
the tack out of his foot. His sufferings
wore ' not ameliorated ; when j he . was
told that the tack bad nothing to do
with the ceremonies.— New York Post.

Oldest Fire Engine.
The original fire engine, the first ma

Dartmouth, England. It is only 4 feet
long and 4 feet C Inches In height. The
car rests on four small wheels, and the
hose is attached to the top." A clumsy
lever placed at the back of the car sets
the machine in motion. The stream
thus forced through the pipe was very

SOCIETY IN IRELAND.
A Person Is Judged There Entirely
Vpon His Merits.
.An English' scribe gives a delightful
picture of Irish society,. in which, 'she'
says, there are "no millionaires' and no
nouveaux* riches.'' .Titles . there are in'
plenty, but position counts for : noth
ing : unless ! the persons in question are
"good . sorts" 1n • themsehra. Whereas
in England one is tolerated principally
for one's wealth, in Scotland for one's
birth, In Ireland It would appear one
is Judged entirely on one's merits. ;.:'.•
"The average Irish household differs
from the English, in, being less stiff,
more ' amusing and more hospitable.

■Where They Were Appreciated.
The government has with great lib
erality distributed public ■ documents
from Washington to the remotest parts
of the country. In his book on ■"The
Overland . Stage to ■ California" Mr.
Franklin Root tells how the overload
ed mails were sometimes relieved.
Before the dally mail went into oper
ation and when a stage went to' Salt
Lake City only once a week some of
the boys on the line used to despise a
coach almost wholly loaded up with
public documents, but such mail mat
ter came quite handy at times. .
Occasionally the drivers, as they
themselves said,* would get stalled go
ing through a bad slough \ In- rough
weather and would be unable to move.
In that case they were obliged to take
oat Back after sack of the "pub. docs.,"
open the bags . and pile the massive
books from the government < printing
office Into the slough and by. building
a solid foundation with them were en
abled to pull the coach out of the mire.
The Old Jewish Wedding Ring.
The old time Jewish wedding ring
was quite a ponderous affair of filigree
gold, enameled in colors. A dome or
temple in miniature, which rose from
the middle of the hoop, was a favorite
device. Sometimes the hoop was about
three-quarters of an inch wide and had
raised edges.
One ring of this kind is described by
an authority as having five elevations
on the upper part, the center la hex
agonal tower, with penthouse roof slop
ing down to the hoop, the gables and
sides pierced with , fourteen holes,- or
windows, and the roof scored to imi
tate tiles. On either side of this was a
smaller tower without windows. No
other ring could find room on a wom
an's finger besides this.

"I think he's the most ? intelligent
hunting dog in this country," said the
owner of the animal, proudly exhibit

and asks as plainly as if he spoke it,

to may doctor's medicine I ever used
and I know whereof I speak. ■ I suf-
fered for nina months with suppressed
menstruation which completely pros-
trated me. Pain* would shoot through
mj back and sides and I would have
■ blinding headaches. My limbs wonld
■well up and I would feel so weak I
could not stand up. I naturally felt
discouraged tor I seemed to be beyond
the help of physicians, bat Wine of
Oardai came as a God-send to me. I
felt a change for the better within a
, week. After nineteen days treatment -
I menstruated without suffering the
agonies I usually did and soon became
regular and without pain. Wine of
Cardui is simply wonderful and I wish
that all suffering women knew of its
good qualities.
