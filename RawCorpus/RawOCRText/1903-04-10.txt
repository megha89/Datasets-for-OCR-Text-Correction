JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY. CALIIORNIA, FRIDAY. APRIL 10. L 903.
A BIASED SON OF ERIN.
Hla Original Snifareation For En-
larging O'Sulllvan Caacade.
In his "Becollectiops" Aubrey de
,Vere tells of an Irishman be met in
Switzerland with whom patriotism was
so truly a mania that every word hi
praise of the scenery about him seemed
a distinct aspersion on the land of his
birth. "What can you compare here,"
he demanded, "with the mountains of
iWicklowr .
"Perhaps," Bald a traveler, "one
might name the "mountains of the Mont
Blanc range." - .
"Oh," he replied scornfully, "they're
out of all reason I lam after walking
nlong the Chamounl valley for three
days and I saw only four of those
mountains.- Sure, In Wicklow I'd have
counted as many as eight of them in
three hours."
"Have you seen this wonderful wa
terfall within half a mile of usr
"1 have not seen It, and I am not go
ing to see It. Didn't I Bee the CSulll
van cascade at Klllarney? Down It
comes from such a height -that you
don't know where it comes from. Down
it plunges, thundering and bellowing,
sometimes black as ink and sometimes
white as milk, dashing itself against
the right band rocks and smashing It
self against the left hand ones. What
Is your Handeck fall compared to
that?"Jv : . - .  ,
"Some persons would say," was the
reply, "that the waterfall here is about
ten times as high and six times as
broad."
"Ah, then," said he, with an added
note of scorn, "then Utp O'Sullivan cas
cade is not big enoufh for you? And
tell me this now: Couldn't you take a
magnifying glass to it?"
Chinese Engagemeiita.
A Chinese engagement dates its be
ginning from the exchange of red cards
between the parents of the contracting
parties. These cards in many districts
are immense documents, almost the
size of a horse blanket They are im
portant for the reason that they are
used as evidence in case of disagree
ments in the future. We seldom bear
hi China of broken engagements. Yet
If a quarrel cannot be settled peaceful
ly recourse is had to the law, and the
Judge usually Imposes* a fine upon the
party who has broken the contract '
g The chief incident in a Chinese mar
riage is the arrival of the bride in her
bridal clothes before the bouse of her
chosen one. That is a de facto fulfill
ment of the contract The wedding day
Is determined by the parents of the
groom. The imperial calendar names
the lucky days, and on such days the
so called red celebrations take place,
both in the cities and country.
The Leverage In n Screwdriver.
,- It is sometimes supposed by persona
Imperfectly informed in mechanics that
a long screwdriver gives grenter lev
erage than a short one. This, - bow
ever, is Incorrect The action of a
screwdriver, the pressure on which is
direct, is not in any way analogous to
that of a lever. The superiority of a
long screwdriver rests simply on two
facts— first, you can generally get a
better grip on a long screwdriver than
on a short one and can bring the whole
weight of the body and strength of the
arms to bear on it, and, second, the tor
sion of the iron in a long screwdriver
comes in to supplement the force em
ployed. The only way in which lever
age can come in is In connection with
the breadth of the point of the screw
driver, and even this counts for noth
ing beyond the breadth of the head of
the screw.
An Irish Sqnlre'a Advice.
.. An upstart Irish squire went to an
old squire for advice as to sending a
challenge.
1 "Healy of Loughlinstown," said he,
"has threatened to pull me by the nose
whenever he meets me. What would
you advise me to do?"
"Has he really used that threat?"
asked the squire.
"He has."
"Well," said the squire, "I'll tell you
what to do— soap your nose well and
It will slip through his fingers."
Perhaps. the most contemptuous dec
lination of a challenge was that of an
Irish gentleman of the old school.
"Fight with him!" he exclaimed. "I
would rather go to my grave without
a fight!"— Kansas City Independent.
Maalca and Facet.
Masks are of very ancient origin. In
a tomb 3,000 years old at Mycenae, Dr.
Schliemann found two bodies with
faces covered by. masks of g01d.. -One
of the masks represented the head of
a lion. Among ancient Greeks the lion
mask was a sign of distinction. With
the Peruvians of old it was a mark of
royal lineage. In a grave of considera
ble antiquity in Peru a silver mask
was "found on the head of a mummy.
The mummy of a prince who lived in
the reign of Barneses 11., discovered In
a small vault at Memphis, In Egypt,
had a mask of gold leaf over the face.
Qnlclilr Arranged.
A Chicago mother, on hearing that
her sister had received a j new little
rlrl sold to Lillian, her little daughter:
"Lillian, auntie has a new baby, and
now mamma Is the baby's aunt. Papa
Is the baby's uncle, and you are her lit
tle cousin."
"Well," sold Lillian wonderlngly,
"wasn't that arranged quick?"
He "Was.
"What's the matter, Bill? You look
kind of weather beaten this morning."
"That* s exactly what I am. I bet $5
It would lain yesterday, and it didn't"

ODD RUSSIAN CUSTOM.
Am Annual Assembly For the Promo-
tion of Matrimony.
In compliance with an ancient Kus
lian custom all the young men and wo
men of the mercantile class in St Pe
tersburg assemble on Whitmonday, the
former to stare and the latter £o be
Btared at The young girls, dressed as
richly as their' means will allow, -are
arranged in long rows by the sides of
the flower beds in the summer garden.
With their mammas standing behind
them. The wardrobes of their mothers
and grandmothers :ire laid under con
tribution, and everything bright and
gaudy is carefully brought forward to
enrich the drapery, the headdress or
Ihe girdle.
Some of the young ladles are so cov
ered with gold and Jewelry on these oc
casions that their natural charms are
altogether concealed; Indeed the lu
dicrous excess to which this sort of
decoration . is sometimes . carried goes
beyond what has ever been attempted
elsewhere. Thus bedizened the blush
ing damsels are drawn up in mute
rows, while the papas, In flowing
caftans and curling beards, parade
their sons up and down. Here and there
the papas and mammas try to lead the
young folks into conversation with one
another, in the course of which certain
little looks and emotions may arise,
pregnant with future circumstances.
Eight days or so after this bridal ex
hibition private family meetings take
place,- at which those whose hearts
are captivated at the grand show are
more formally affianced to one another
by their parents and relatives.—
"Sketches of St Petersburg."
Kindergarten and Cltlaenanlp.
The kindergarten offers a special ad
vantage — namely, the opportunity for
practice of citizenship before real civic
duties present themselves. Theory Is a
necessary preliminary to performance,
even when the doer is not sufficiently
enlightened in hla work to be aware
that he holds a theory. But practice is
the test of theory. Right here In the
kindergarten our six-year-olds are un
consciously testing theories of life
through problems which will arise,
willy nilly, even in a child's life, as
soon as that child begins to come in
contact with other children. The chil
dren solve these problems for them
selves. But the wise eye is upon them,
the suggestive word awaits their need,
the helping hand adjusts conditions and
provides the material for the children
to act against The master mind of the
kindergarten — for such it ought to be—
permits mistakes, it is true, but at the
same time It prevents the fumbling ap
prentice from the discouragement of
the unnecessary stumble.— Gunton's
Magazine.
'Wonderful Thing* In Heredity.
It is a fact well established by stu
dents of heredity that children are apt
to inherit not only the physical, mental
and moral traits of their parents, but
to be influenced by their age as well.
Children born of very young fathers
and mothers never attain so vigorous a
growth of mind or body as those of old
er men and women, while children of
old people are born old.
One of the most surprising cases in
medical history Is that of Marguerite
Cribsownn, who died in 17G3, aged 10S
years. When ninety-four, she was mar
ried to a man aged 103. Three children
came of this union, but they had gray
hair, no teeth, were stooped, yellow
and wrinkled, decrepit in movement
and could eat only bread and vegeta
bles.
A Tery Old Bat.
Among the treasures in the safe cus
tody of Corpus Christ! college, Oxford,
is an old, old hat .which was found in
an Egyptian tomb and must date back
at least 5,000 years.
Its simplicity of make has been its
safeguard, for it has no nap or perish
able trimmings, such as moths might
corrupt It is closely akin to what Is
now known as a panama straw hat and
is of such excellent quality that it can
be folded or crushed without any barm
to its appearance. It is also quite on
well adapted for practical use now as
it was in the days of the pharaobs.

A LONG BENTENCE.
One That Dlaeonnted the Lonareat
One ESvarta Ever Uttered.
Abram 8. Hewitt had a very nimble
wit and dearly loved a joke. He was
once a guest at a dinner which Includ
ed Recorder Smyth and Senator E varts.
The recorder was poking fun at the
senator and read from a newspaper
clipping what purported to be a sen
tence from a recent speech made by
the senator, but which was in reality
wholly fictitious, as the senator knew
quite well. At its conclusion the laugh
was long and hearty at Mr. Evarta' ex
pense, and no one laughed longer or
heartier than the senator himself.
! As soon as the laughter had subsided
Mr. Hewitt suddenly leaned across the
table and, looking rather sternly Into
the smiling face of the recorder, said in
a well assumed tone of reproach:
J'That certainly Is a remarkable sen
tence^ your honor, but criticism of It
does not come well from you if today's
newspapers are to be believed, for they
contain aya v sentence of much greater
length which is attributed to you."
"Why— why, how Is that, Mr. Hew
itt?" inquired the recorder, with con
siderable confusion.
"Because," said Mr. Hewitt with the
utmost gravity and that grim smile
which always accompanied his best
sayings, "you are there quoted as ut
tering a sentence that was to last
through the whole life of the prisoner."
—Philadelphia Ledger.
The Uanal War.
A man had a piece of news.
A reporter heard of it
The reporter called on the man.
And asked him about the news.
The man played balloon with the re
porter.
He swelled noticeably and said:
"You fellers never get anything
right. So I won't tell you."
The reporter did not get angry.
He. knew the man was a fool.
He had seen htm before.
He knew the real facts could be had
from no one else.
Yet the reporter did the very best ht
could to get at the truth.
And published the story as he got it
Then the man who had refused to
give the facts arose early and bought a
paper to see if the facts were distorted.
They were.
And be said:
"I told you so."
Query.— With whom should the public

Anlmala and Rain.
It seems strange that no animal, un
less It be the squirrel, seems to build it
self a shelter with the express object
of keeping off the rain, which they all
so much dislike. Monkeys are misera
ble in wet and could easily build shel
ters if thpy hnd the sense to do so. "As
the creatures hop disconsolately nlong
in the rain," writes Mr. Kipling in his
"Beast and Man In India," "or croucb
on branches, with dripping backs set
ngalust the tree trunk. as shelter from
a driving storm, they have the air of
being very sorry for themselves." But
even the orang outang, which -builds
a small platform in the trees on which
to sleep at night, never seems to think
of a roof, though the Dyaks say that
when it Is very wet it covers itself with
the leaves of the pandanus, a large
fern.— London Spectator.' , * j
No Miner a In Burma,
When a Burman has earned a littla
money, he immediately i proceeds |- to
spend it all, for the Burmese have no
ambition to be rich and never hoard.
Consequently there are no large land
owners, and, there being no aristocracy,
the people are as near being on an
equality as possible. Poor people an
quite as rare as rich people, and the
only beggars to be met with are the
lepers, who sit on the steps of the pago
das. Should a Burman find himself in
possession of a large sum' of money he
builds a pagoda and possibly a zayat,
or restbouse. If any money still re
mains, he gives a theatrical perform
ance.
An Advantage From Foara.
In speaking of fogs a medical Journal
draws some consolation from the fact
that even fogs hare one compensating
advantage which has often been over
looked. "It is," It says, "reasonable to
suppose that a fog effects a partial
purification of the atmosphere. This ii
borne out by the fact that when a fog
subsides the deposits contain the car
bon, sulphur, organic bases and other
Injurious and irritating particles which
formerly existed In a state of suspen
sion in the atmosphere."

RELIGION. IN CHINA. *"
There Are Three State Sratema, Oobv
f uclanlmu, Buddhism anil Taoism.
In theory Confucianism is the re
ligion* of the state. The state officials
are the literati who have secured theli
positions through the study of the
classics— L c., the "Sacred Writings oi
Confucius." The Confuclanlst temples
are protected and honored by the state,
•ml the worship of Confucius is carried
)n at the expense of the state. In a
limited sense, too, Buddhism can also
claim to be a state religion. The same
is also true of Taoism, since deceased
generals and statesmen are assigned
their corresponding ranks .with the
Toolstic king of the lower world In
hades. In this role they are worshiped
In Taoistic temples. In this way it ll
possible for a Chinaman to make use
of all three religions without getting
Into conflict with the distinctive prin
ciples of any of them. Their officials
worship together. In funeral service!
monks of both orders are fonnd per
forming functions on different days.
The public temples are usually In
control of the Taoists, but sometimes
are in charge of Buddhists. Not rarely
Taoistic gods are found in Buddhist
temples and vice versa. Sometimes
they differ only in name. The Bud
dhist goddess of mercy is the Taolst
goddess of heaven. The pearl king of
the Taoists is the imperial ruler of the
Buddhists. Both systems teach the
same ten princes in hades, and even
a reproduction of the Buddhist punish
ment in hell is found in the Taolst tem
ples.
A Powerful River.
"Should one be asked at random to
name the most powerful river in New
England— that is, the river yielding the
most water power and doing the mos<
work— he would be likely to name the
Merrlmac," said M. S. Edgar of Port
land, Me. "He would have In mind
the great manufacturing city of Low
ell, and the answer would be a natural
one. It is surprising, \ therefore, to be
told by the United States geological
survey that the most powerful river in
New England is the Androscoggln.
Yet the surprise abates when the fact)
are recounted. There are nine or ten
developed water powers along the riv
er,' and it appears that they furnish to
tal power equal to 73,000 horses. The
falls at Brunswick yield 7,700 horse
: power; at Lisbon Falls, 1,925; at Lewis
ton, 12,000; at Livermore Falls, 3,000;
! at Otis Falls, 8,000; at Jay's, 3,700; ai
' Peterson's Hips, 0,000. At Rumford
Falls there Is a potential of 30,000
horsepower when the resources at thai
place are fully developed, and that le
altogether the greatest water power Is

If is neglected consumption
that is so often incurable.

THE KESWICK STRIKE.
How it wsa Inaugurated, and the Forces
« ; . , it Behind It ;
; The Redding Free Press publishes
the following statement, signed by 146
employes of the Mountain Copper Com
pany of Keswick, giving the inside his
tory of the ' strike which "has been in
progress at that point, and 'which is
now in the throes of dissolution.' ' It is
an object tewon worthy of considera
tion by the business interests of Jack
son at this juncture, j It shows what
harm can be done by a few irresponsible
and hot-headed ~ men, when they get
the notion that they have the backing
and financial aid of a powerful organiza
tion. The signers have been I employes
of the company from one to 7} years.
To The Public:— As a committee
representing the • old - employes of the
Mountain Copper Company, we issue
this statement covering the relations of
the Mountain Copper Company with
its employes as we have seen them dur
ing our time of service as . set opposite
our names attached hereto. '
The Mountain Copper Company ■ has
never,' to our knowledge, discrimi
nated against any workman on account
of his affiliations. It has been at all
times just and courteous in its dealings
with the employes. r Union men, who
in the past . have been thrown . out of
employment by . reason of industrial
disturbances/ have found the smelter
and mine havens of refuge. About . SO
per cent of those working on the com
pany 's local railroad ' were strikers ' in
the gigantic strike of 1894. During the
trouble in San Francisco two years ago,
hundreds of men of various affected
trades came here seeking work and
found it without questions being asked
about their sympathies or labor, con
nections, .'i - K-\K -\ : '. ■ ?<*.: ''
A - few months ago the Western
Federation of Miners of ■ Denver'or
ganized a union. This local association
elected as . its president a common ,
drunkard who had been twice In the
hospital for treatment for injuries re
ceived In saloon frays. It had for vice
president and secretary two non-em
ployes of the company, the former a
barkeeper, the latter a barber and re
porter on a county paper. One of its
executive committeemen I was, accord
ing to his boast, a "floater,'? and an
other was a man who , worked • but a
couple of months . in . the smelter and
who openly stated that he joinod for
what was in It; that he was out for. the
job of organizer at $5 per day. . .- '
1 These drunkards, grafters and non
employes gathered together a motley
crowd of men who were for the most
part of Latins, Slavs and boys. Subse
quently five men were discharged for
neglect of duty . They had been on a
continuous spree. | The ''union" with
out consulting the "allied interests,"
or the big majority of company's em
ployes, demanded the immediate rein
statement of those habitual drunkards
and the recognition of its order. Both
demands were refused. The "union"
was not a representative body either
in the quantity or quality of its ; mem
bers. . It had but a quarter of the em
ployes of the company. In this minori
ty was only a very small number of the
skilled or "old time" employes. We
say that this body was neither respect
able nor responsible, and that what
ever It would do would be the voicing
of the mind and sentiments of the
radical, ignorant foreigners.
On January 31st this strike ended.
On February the 19th the "Union 143"
took up the question of reopening | the
strike but voted it down by a 58 to 41
vote.
T. J. Lewis, member the Executive
Board of the Western Federation of
Miners and its sole representative in
this district, declared at the meeting
that be was opposed to another strike
because there was not sufficent cause for
one; that the Western Federation of
Miners would not tolerate or support
it. -
Three days later, February 22, 1903,
the Western Federation of Miners of
Denver ordered a strike without con
sidering the recent vote or further con
sidering the local "union.'.' . ... .-.:
The company was not in any way
hindered ob hampered in its operations.
Only 87 members obeyed the order. On
the other hand there are over 500 men
working at the smelter and mine.
In their propaganda the leaders and
organizers made bitter attacks upon all
other labor organizations, belittling
their power and influence and benefits,
casting slurs upon the ability and sin
cerity of the respective officials. They
tried every means to force conscientious
union '• men to destroy - their time
honored cards and to join this federa
tion which has no standard of . admit -
ance. It takes in all kinds and classes
of men, employes or non-employes,
skilled or unskilled workmen, anybody
and everybody.
The stronger this society grows the

Ancient Proofreading.
The editions of books printed 200 or
200 years ago are almost entirely free
from typographical errors, which may
be' attributed to the fact that early
publishers were generally eminent
scholars, and themselves gave much
.attention •to the revision of their
proofs. After reading the proofs they
frequently turned them over to other
scholars with the request to revise and
correct, and as .the printer's time was
then deemed a matter of small conse
quence a perfection was attained which
is seldom equaled by modem printers.

FRIDAY APRIL 10, 1903
THE SALARY GRAB SCHEME.
The effort to place the present
justices of the peace and constables
under the provisions of the salary
bill passed by the last legislature
has assumed two diverse phases dur
ing the past week. Last Monday
these township officers put in their
claims before the supervisors for
services in criminal matters up to
the 19tb of March, that being the
date on which the new law went
into effect. For services since the
19th it was contended that they
were entitled to pay under the sal
ary act, and the allowance of sal
aries was clearly outside the prov
ince of the supervisors. Thereafter
W. L. Rose, elected justice of the
peace of township 4 on the demo
cratic ticket, served a written
notice upon G. L. Gulbert as coun
ty auditor, requesting him to forth
with make out and deliver to said
petitioner a warrant on the couuty
treasurer in the sum of $17.33} in
payment of salary as justice of the
peace from March 19th, 1903, to
March 31st, 1903, both inclusive, ac
cording to the provision of the act
approved by the governor March 18.
The auditor refused to draw the
warrant. The next step on the
program will be a mandamus suit in
the . superior court to compel the
auditor to issue the warrant. This
is one phase of the salary problem.
It must be borne in mind that Rose
is a democrat. The board of super
visors is republican. The only hope
of himself, and his brother demo
cratic officials of collecting under
the provisions of the bill, lies in a
straight out contest on the constitu
tionality of the law.
But an entirely different phase
crops up before the supervisors. It
will be seen that J. E. Kelly, con
stable of lone, and D. F. Gray, con
stable of Sutter Creek, have resign
ed as such officers. It may be asked,
what is the meaning of this action.
If the salary bill holds, the con
stableship is an office that will, not
go begging. The resignation busi
ness is simply a move to secure the
benefit of the salary without a con
test in court. We were apprised
several days ago that a scheme was
afoot to have the township officers
resign, and be reappointed by the
supervisors. They would on their
reappointment be relieved of all
obligations laid upon them by their
election to accept the compensation
as fixed by the then existing law.
It is argued that the law in force at
the time of appointment would
govern in such cases. It is a shrewd
move to reap the benefit of increas
ed pay. The two officials who have
resigned occupy different positions.
Kelly is a democrat, and was elected
at the last election to succeed him
self. Gray on the other hand is a
republican. He declined a renomi
nation, on the ground that the pay
was inadequate. He continued to
hold the office as a hold-over
upon the failure of the one elected to
qualify, and the office was forced upon
him against his will. There is there
fore some reason in his resignation,
with a view to reappointment to bring
him under the provision of the new
law. With Kelly it is somewhat
different. In case of his reappoint
ment would be, having been elected
under the old law, be entitled to the
increase of pay provided by the new
law. 'If so, nothing becomes more
simple than the evasion of the con
stitutional provision that salaries
shall not be increased during the
term for which an official was elect
ed. Beside this, the board being re
publican, would Kelly bo reappoint
ed anyway. Is it not likely that a
republican will turn up for appoint
ment, and get away with the plum?
Altogether, the situation is comical
enough, and tangled enough to re
quire more than one day in court to
straighten it out.
AT SEA AS USUAL.
Judging by what is heard on the
streets and what is published, tho Led
ger editor, who poses as the leader of
republicans, but who ia in reality so
politically blind that he cannot with
safety lead himself, will endeavor to de
feat the aims and objects of the new
salary law as pertains to this county.
As it will be up to the supervisors,
people are wondering whether the
would-be dictator can control that body
The Echo says no.— lone Echo.
The above serves to show how
hopelessly the literary genius of the
Athens of Amador county flounders
in misstatements whenever he ven
tures to strain his intellect by writ
ing an editorial of a couple of sen
tences in length. In trying the
smart act he airs his own ignorance,
on a subject which he is expected to
be posted. A man who misleads his
readers, when the means of correct
information is withi^ his reach, is
nothing more than a perverter of
the truth because he prefers to be
such. If the distinguished Athenian
scholar had taken the trouble to
hunt up a copy of the codes he would
have found the following section
therein concerning the permanent
powers of the board of supervisors:
' 12." To examine, settle and allow
all accounts legally chargeable
against the county, except salaries
of officers.
In faceof this wholesome provision,
the new salary law is not "up to the
supervisors."" Its interpretation
and enforcement never can be up to
that body. It is a matter outside of
their jurisdiction. Official salaries
are fixed t>y a higher power than
supervisors, and it would be the
hight of absurdity, after adopting a
salary schedule, to refer the matter
to supervisors for final determina
tion. The bugaboo created by the
over-burdened brain of our-cotem
porary is thus effectually disposed
of. Furthermore, the editor of the
Ledger is not posing, never has
posed, and never ■ will pose as the
leader of the republicans. He is
dead set against all leadership in
the shape of bossism in the republi
can ranks. The republican party is
not in need of leadership of that
character. It can get along much
better without the aid of self-ap
pointed dictators. It will always be
the policy of the' Ledger to oppose
such schemes of leadership.' With
this declaration, the balance of the
statements in the above quotation
falls by the wayside. We trust our
amiable cotemporary.will not again
endanger his mental balance by ven
turing beyond his depth.
COUNTY PATRONAGE.
. Unpleasant though the subject be,
we feel constrained to refer to the
action of the board of supervisors
this week in declaring the Amador
Record the official paper — that is,
the medium through which advertise
ments ordered by the board shall be
published. For two years the Led
ger in a nominal way has enjoyed
this distinction. The patronage of
the board of supervisors of Amador
county is probably less than any
other county of equal wealth and
population in the state. Small as
it is, the Ledger has never received
it all. Whenever a notice had to be
published which concerned some par
ticular portion of the county outside
of the county seat, such notice has
usually been published in the paper
published within the boundaries of
the affected territory. The proposed
incorporation of Sutter Creek may
be cited as a case in point. That
notice — as profitable a one as any
published during the past two years
—was ordered published in the Rec
ord, notwithstanding thejact that
the paper voiced neither the views
of the majority nor those of the su
pervisor of that district. To this
policy the Ledger never raised a
word of protest, notwithstanding it
was a radical departure from the
course followed by the board during
the long period of democratic ascen
dancy.
April is the month when the ad
vertising for proposals for supplies
of court house and hospital is or
dered. Ordinarily the adverising for
that month amounts to as much as
for all other months combined. It
has never before been selected as the
time for making any change in the
official newspaper, and not the
slightest intimation of any contem
plated change, or any movement to
that end, reached the editor of the
Ledger from any source. The whole
scheme was hidden away in the minds
of its concoctors, and those who lent
themselves so meekly in carrying it
into "execution." There was no op
portunity given to offset the move
ment in any way. It was a star
chamber proceeding from its con
ception to its consummation. We
mention this fact not merely in jus
tice to ourself, but to show what ex
alted ideals some people cherish
regarding the proper conduct of pub
lic business. .
The proprietors ot lone Echo and
Sutter Creek Record, no doubt in
pursuance of a preconcerted ar
rangement, each forwarded a com
munication asking that his publica
tion be declared the official paper.
Tuesday afternoon the chairman of
the board announced that an "exe
cutive" session was in order. This
was an intimation for all spectators
to withdraw, that a secret conclave
was on tap. This closed-door custom
is an innovation of recent years
— one that would be far more hon
ored in the breach than in the keep
ing. Who or what was executed at
this secret gathering we do not
know. Upon again assembling iv
open session, the democratic mem
ber from Plymouth, if you please,
moved that the Record be declared
the official paper. Think of it. No
question of a closer partisan charac
ter can arise than giving the county
advertising to the paper or papers
supporting the candidates of the
dominant party. Such matters ought
to be settled by. caucus of the.mem
bers of the party of the majority.
Democrats would not invite repub
licans to participate in a caucus in
volving their party interests. But
here we have a democrat naming be
fore a republican board the official
paper of Amador county. What a
spectacle for the stalwart republi
cans of Amador county to contem
plate. If a democrat should nomin
ate other than a member of his par
ty for United States senator in a re
publican legislature, that act would
either be deemed sufficient to read
him out of his party, or be viewed
with such suspicion by the members
of the majority party that they
would consider it their" duty to fight
shy of such nominee. They would
not only revolt at the idea of a man
outside their party lines assuming
to lead them on a political question,
but they would argua that the can
didate that was satisfied with a
democratic send-off under such con
ditions, was not the right kind of
material to command republican
votes. But the republican super
visor from township three played
the amiable role of seconding the
motion. This was in accordance
with the eternal fitness of things.
It was in keeping with the hybrid
policy mapped out, and the go-be
tween sheet they had mutually
decided upon as their- mouthpiece-
W.M. Amick of Tone, to his credit
be it said, had sufficient appreciation
of the situation to keep aloof from
THE AHABOB LEDGER; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FftIDAY. APRIL 10 1903
unseemly alliance. The Record sig
nalized itself in the last campaign
by not merely failing to support
every candidate for a county offlce
ou the republican ticket, but opeuly
advocated the opposing candidate?.
The present proprietor of that sheet
has not been in the editorial harness
long enough to participate in a politi
cal campaign. The success of the
plot was celebrated on the streets of
Jackson the same afternoon over the
convivial glass and the congratula
tory handshake, but republicans were
conspicuous by their absence from
the jollification.
The Ledger has been the unfalter
ing advocate of republican principles
and policies from the days of Lin
coln until vow. It will contiuue to
support them, not because such, a
course has been profitable, but be
cause it is right.. Ten thousand in
stances of political ingratitude would
not cause us to veer one iota from
the path which we believe to be
right. We look for nought else than
misrepresentation and abuse from
political opponents. But we did not
expect to be wounded and belittled
in the house of our friends. We ex
tend our congratulations to the su
pervisors — regardless of their party
affiliations — for their latest achieve
ment iv unwittingly crowning sore
head ism and personal spleen as the
moving springs of political action.

A Sweet Breath
Is a never failing sign of a healthy
stomach. When the breath is bad the
stomach ia out of order. There is no
remedy hi the world equal to Kodol
Dyspepsia Cure for curing indigestion,
dypepsia and all stomach disorders.
Mrs. Mary S. Crick, of White Plains,
Ky:, writes: "I have been a dyspeptic
for years— tried all kinds of remedies
but continued to grow worse. By tho
use of Kodol I began to improve, at
once, and after taking a few bottles am
fully restored in weight, health and
strength and can eat whatever I like.
Kodol digests what you eat and makes
the stomach sweet. Kerr's Pharmacy,

A Good Woman Gone.
The funeral of the late Mrs. Christine
Hoffman took place from the family
residence in Jackson at 2 p. m, Wed
nesday, April 8. The servico at the
house was conducted by Rev. G. H.
Van Vliet of the M. E. church. Jack
son Rebekah Lodgo No. 53, I. O. O. F.,
of which -ordor tho deceased was a
worthy member, attended in a body,
and escorted tbo remains to tho grave,
administering tbo last sad rites which
tho living can render to the deuTl. The
esteem in which Mrs. Hoffman was
held by the people . of Jackson and
vicinity was manifested by the many
friend:, who came to pay tribute to
her true character known to all. "The
Qorul offerings wore many and beauti
ful, and the grave was entirely covered
with those tokens of love and respect.
The pallbearers were W. F. Dotert,
J. H. Langhorst, Jas. Meehan, Chas.
Meek, L.Poggi, and L. J. Fontenroso.
Mrs. Hoffman, whose maiden name
way Christine Klamn, was born in
Bavaria, .- Germany, March 2, 1836.
She came to California direct from tho
country of her birth, in May, 1861, and
was married at Diamond Springs Sept.
17th of the same year to Frank Hoff
man, who was a well known liveryman
of Jackson at that time, and who now
mourns the death of a good, true and
loving wife. Those who knew Mrs.
Hoffman during the many years whiob
she has lived in Jackson, can speak :of
her in words of kindnoss only. Not
only was her home lifo an ideal one,
but her gentle influence caused all to
know her and to love her. The acts of
charity which she rendered to the poor
and neudy will ever bo remembered by
the many to whop she has given aid,
and yet her charity was so modest tbat
her acts of benevolence were unknown
to many of hor dearest friends.
' Mrs. Hoffman had been a member of
Jackson Rebekah Lodge No. 53 a good
many years, and had always been inter
ested in the welfare of the lodge, but
attended their gatherings very little of
late. Mrs. Hoffman had been in feeble
health for several months. - She has
not been out pf her house since the 9th
of September, when she came in town
to witness tho Native Son's celebration.
Heart failure was the direct cause of
her death, and while it was known that
her sufferings - were intense at times,
she was never known to utter one word
of complaint. While her death was
not unexpected it was a shock to her
husband and relatives. She paused
away peacefully and quietly at her
home at 4:30 p. m. Sunday, April ' sth.
Mrs. Hoffman leaves a fond husband
to mourn her death, also a sister and
brother in Germany, a brother in
Cleveland, Ohio, three nieces in Jack
son, Mrs. Dr. Schacht, Christina Klamn
and Christina Rickert, and three
nephews, Anton Rickert, Will Kesler,
and Jacob Griesbach.
A Sadden Mix Up.
Sunday morning tho lone stage' was
spinning along at a Jjyely clip, and just
as the Morrow grade was reached 'one
of the lead horses went off his feet and
fell to the ground. The trick was
turned so quickly that Chris didn't
have a chance to gather up the lines,
and in an instant the horses were all
piled in a heap. The stage was filled
with passengers, and they bad a good
scare, thinking another hold-up was
the cause of the sudden halt. When
the surprise of the moment was passed,
it was found that three of the horses
were down, and the fourth, a colt,
quietly standing, and evidently wonder
ing what it all meant. With the aid of
tho passengers and "Deacon" Peek,
the driver of the baggage wagon, the
team was unhitched, and after a few
niiuuto's delay were ready to start.
Chris is unable to explain the action of
the horse that caused the trouble, as
he fell without stumbling pr giving the :
least warning that he was going'oiit of
business. Strange to say, there wasn't
as much as a scratch on any of the
horses, and noue of them seemed to be
any the worse for their experience.
The Case Against Adams.
Jack Adams was arrested over a
month ago for burglarizing the store
of F. Cademartori, and stealing there
from over $5 in small coin. There was
a general indisposition to proseGUte pn
the grave charge of felony, this being
his first offense. Mr. Cademartori de
clined to swear out a complaint on the
subordinate charge of petty larceny.
Sheriff Norman, if compelled to take
action, would only make complaint for
the graver charge. In this dilemma
the matter .has dragged along-, until
the sheriff notified parties interested
that action would have to be taken
inside of three days, otherwise he
would take up the matter. This
brought things to a focus. On Tues
day A. Caminetti swore to a complaint
for petty larceny. The defendant
ploaded guilty before Judge Goldner
the same day, and was fined 8100 or
100 days in jail. He is still in jail.
* Give He a Smoke.
A few days ago we heard a child of
tender ago say to a business man of
Jackson, "Give me a smoke," The
juvenile was dead in earnest, as was
evidenced by his manner as he begged
repeatedly and piteously for the weed.
When asked his age, he said he was
eleven years old, and had been In the
habit of smoking for three years. "The
habit had taken such a strong hold of
him, that he seemed actually suffering
for the wherewith to satisfy his crav
ing, as much so as a confirmed smoker
of adult years. He was pale faced and
apparently delicate as might be ex
pected in one who had been a victim of
the health-destroying weed from in
fancy. He said he attended school at
Jackson Gate, but his teacher had no
authority over him except during
school hours. How a boy of such years
manages to secure material to indulge
to such a degree in smoking is beyond
comprehension. No doubt this is by
no means a rare occurrence. It is a
sample of scores of cases that exist
hereabouts. It shows a lamentable
lack of parental control. No wonder
so many of our young men grow up
without ambition or aim in life when
such pernicious habits are permitted to
sap the vital forces' at so early a period.

Local Reporter and Collector.
We are pleased tq announce that we
have i secured the services of F. H.
Duden as local reporter, collector, and
general outside man for the Ledger.
Mr. Duden is well known not only to
the people of Jackson, but throughout
the county. He has lived among us
several years, and his reputation for
integrity and attention to business is
well established. We commend him
to our patrons, as worthy of their full
est confidence and support, and any
business entrusted to him will be
promptly attended to and duly appreci
ated. The Ledger intends to make a
thorough canvass of every section of
the county during the next few months,
for all classes of work connected with
the newspaper and job printing busi
ness. Mr. Duden is the right man for
this mission. We want to see the Led
ger in every home in Amador county,
It has already by far the largest circu
lation of any paper In the county, but
we want to extend its circulation and
influence. Our arrangements with Mr.
Duden are such that he is just as much
interested financially in the success of
the Ledger as Its proprietor. We be
speak for him favorable considerations
and a liberal share of patronage.

A False Humor.
: A rumor was circulated on the streets
of Jackson last Sunday evening that
Fred Lebhardt and Ed. Turner, both
Native Sons and well known through
out this county, were killed by natives
in Central America, where they were
employed in a mine. Senator E. G.
Voorheis of Sutter Creek is the pur
chasing and forwarding representative
of the mine In question, and has in
formed the Ledger that ho has re
ceived no such uews, and cannot under
stand how such a report started. For
if there was any truth in the matter he
would be the first to hear it. The last
word that was received by him from
the mino was oarly in March, and
everything was poaceful and quiet.
Sashed With Work.
Garbarini Bros. blacksmith and
machine shop is a busy place these
days. Last week they had a rush job
from the Kennedy mine, and all hands
were kept busy until 11 p. m. on Satur

Jackson Union Makes Demands.
Friday afternoon a delegation con
sisting of five members belonging to
JacHson Minors' Uulon No. 115, waited
upon the superintendents of the several
mines around Jackson for the purpose
of presenting the formal demands of
this organization concerning the con
duct of the mines. The delegation
consisted of H. Gobish, Sam Radovich,'
W. D. Ould, Geo. Thomas an.d Q. J;
Peters. These were chosen as repre
senta,tivo men pf the underground toil
era. Not a single one is an employe of
either of the companies opera ting here
abouts. They waited upon superin
tendent W. F. Dotert of the Zella, J.
H. Hampton of the Oneida, and Web
Smith of tho Kennedy. With each of
these superintendents they left a state
ment in writing as follows:
Jackson Miners' Union No. 115,
Western Federation of Miners.
Jackson, Cal., Anr. a l«03.
Supt. Mlnp . -ii-i
Etear Sir; "
• '•■"We, the members of Jackson
Miners' Union N,o. 115, through our
representatives, submit to your con
sideration the following demands:
■}st. Non-dlsorlmlnation against mem
bers of the Western Federation.
gnd. Reinstatement of all miners
discharged for affiliating with same.
3rd. Establishment of an eight hour
day for all underground work at the
present scale of wages.
H. Gobish.
Sam Radovich.
Signed— W. D. Ould.
Geo. Thomas.
C. J. Peters.,
The superintendents, were given to
undorstynd that ah answer would be ex
pected to these demands in ten days.
The ten days will expire next Sunday,
On the evening of that day the regular
meeting of Jackson Union will be held,
and the report of the committee re
ceived and action taken thereon.
Explanatory of , the circumstances
which led up to this move on the part
of the labor organization we ! may state
that a special meeting of JaeUsonUnion
was held Thursday night. What tran
spired at. that gathering we do not
know. It is safe to say, however, that
the action taken the following day was
the outcome of the decision reached at
that meeting. According to street ru
mor, about 60 members responded to
the call for the meeting, and gathered
in the hall on Court street to discuss
the weighty problenga involved. The
question pf a etrlke was brought up.
The conservative element was against
such action, but thoy were In the min
ority. We are told that the rules of
organization require a three-forths vote
to order a strike. They managed to
muster just tho number. So in the
event of the " demands " being refused
a strike of some sort is imminent. W hat
it will amount to remains to bo seen.
Citizens generally look upon it as ' a
bluff. The temper of the people Is any
thing but friendly to the disturbance
of our main industry; although many
express relief that the labor question
has reached a crisis, and its determina
tion is in sight,
Wednesday evening Mr. Detert, the
superintendent, addressed the men
while they were changing shift, and
requested that "those who intended to
go out on a strike on Monday, if so
ordered by the union, to step to one
side, in order that the company might
know the amount of money that would
be required to pay them off, as It was
the desire to pay every man in full to
date." The subject of union or non
union men was not mentioned. Seven
men declared their intentions, and
stepped out as requested. One of the
number remarked: "I don't see why
the other three don't come out, " from
which it might be inferred that there
were that many more members of the
union in the mine. " The men that
stepped out wore all Slavonians, and
some of them had worked a Jong time
at the Zeila,
Mr. Hampton, superintendent of the
Oneida, informed the Ledger that the
committee who waited upon him last
Friday were given to understand that
they could expect no recognition from
him, adding further that he informed
them that one member of the com
mittee had been discharged from
the Oneida not on account of his
affiliations with the union. It was for
other reasons, and under no circum
stances would he be reinstated. Mr.
Hampton also stated that as far as he
know his men were all satisfied, and he
expected no trouble.
The Kennedy has discharged no men,
and none have quit, although a rumor
was current that nineteen men had been
given their timo. We have heard of
no action being taken one way or the
other at this mine.
As a aftermath of the proceedings
above related, it was announced early
in the week that W. P. Evarts, the
editor of the Minors' Union, had closed
his brief career in journalism, and de
parted for other fields. The paper has
doubtless been run into the ground,
and stowed away for good. F, M.
Whitmore, who owns the printing ma
terial, was informed Tuesday that the
outfit was left on his hands. Whether
the demise of tho organ and tho de
mands made upon the mine owners
are related to each other we are unable
to say.

CHINESE FESTIVALS.
Blx Curious Feast Days That Usher
In tbe Ifew Year.
The first day of. the Chinese New
Year's feasts is called Bird's day (Kay-
Vat) and is supposed to bring to mind
the utility jf the feathered tribes as
food. On this day all orthodox Chinese
abstain from eating flesh, and they
sometimes observe it as a day of fast
big. The second day is Dog's day (Ku
fat). This day is especially held sa
cred to the canine hosts of tbe. Flowery
Kingdom. The Chinese, notwithstand
ing the fact that they eat the flesh of
the dog and esteem it a great delicacy,
honor their dogs more highly and take
better care of them than any other race
of people. In every large Chinese city
there is a workman whose sole trade is
that of making coffins for departed
canines.
The third day, Hog's day (Chen-Yat),
is celebrated in honor of a hog that
onco drew a valuable manuscript out
of a bonfire of trash. The fourth feast.
Sheep's day (Yaong-Yat), is honored in
memory of Pun Koon Venga, a shep
herd 'who _ clothed himself in leaves,
grass and bark of trees, refusing to
make use of any part of the sheep, ei
ther for food or clothing. The fifth day
Is Cow's day (New-Vat). This day Is
consecrated to the cow that suckled the
orphan who afterward became rich and
built tbe celebrated Temple of Cows.
The sixth day is Ma-Vat, or Horse day.
and is set apart to call to mind tbe use
fulness of that noble animal.
Notable Paintings.
Probably the smallest painting ever
made was the work of the wife of a
Flemish artist It depicted a mill with
the sails bent, the miller mounting the
stairs with a sack of grain on his back.
Upon the terrace where tbe mill stood
was a cart and horse, and on the road
leading to it several peasants were
shown. The picture was beautifully
finished, and every object was very dis
tinct, yet It was so amazingly small
that its surface, so the story goes,
could be covered with a grain of corn.
In contradistinction to this the lar
gest painting, exclusive of frescoes and
panoramas, is Tintoretto's "Paradise."
It is hung in the grand saloon of the
doges' palace at Venice and is 84 feet
wide and 34 feet high.
Michael Angela's fresco in the Slsttne
chapel of the Vatican completely cov
ers the vaulted roof, which measures
183 feet In length and 43 feet In width.
This painting delineates the creation of
man, 'his fall and tbe early history of
the world, with a reference to man's
final redemption and salvation.
Reassuring.
"Oh, Harold," wailed the lovely maid
en, in whose expressive features grief
and Indignation seemed to be strug
gling for the mastery, "how can I be
lieve you in the face of all this evidence
of your perfidy and double dealing?
The letter to Blanche, in your own
handwriting; her photograph, found in
your possession; the fact, as told me by
a dozen witnesses and tacitly con
fessed by you, that you kissed her the
other evening when you were together
In the conservatory — how can you rec
oncile these things with your contin
ued professions of love for me?" .
"All these things, darling," said the
hero of the story, the light of truth
shining in his dark brown eyes and the
Impress of sincerity stamped upon his
noble forehead, "will be satisfactorily
explained In the next chapter I"—Chi
cago Tribune.
No Time to Read.
"Pause, O youtli or maiden," wrote
Andrew Lang In tbe Windsor Maga
zine, "before yon accustom your lips
to this fatal formula, 'I have no time to
readP You have all the time which
for you exists, and it Is abundant
What are you doing with it— with your
leisure? Mainly, gossiping. Our mod
ern malady is gregariousness. We
must be In company chattering.
"To be always with others, always
gregarious, always chattering, like
monkeys in treetops, is our ruling vice,
and this is tbe reason why wo have no
time to read and why you see so many
people pass their leisure when alone
In whistling or whittling. They have
time to whittle." .
Leonardo da Vlncl.
Leonardo da Vinci, the celebrated
Italian painter, sculptor and architect,
died in 1510. He was born in 1452 and
became well versed In all the sciences
and arts of bis time. His most famous
picture is "The Last Supper," painted
on the wall of a convent at Milan. He
la said to have anticipated Galilei,
'. Kepler, Copernicus and others In their
; astronomical theories and also some of
[the discoveries of recent geologists,
though his views are expressed In
somewhat vague language.
BREAKING IT GENTLY.
lie Showed the 'Widow Why It Was
Too Late to Mourn.
After the ship which had come from
Xt>w Zealand was tied up at the wnurf
Larry O'lirien was told off by his ship
mates to call upon Mrs. McCarthy and
break the news of the death of her hus
band, which had occurred on shipboard
the preceding summer. The Brooklyn
Eagle tells how he did it:
"Good morning, Mrs. McCarthy I"
laid he. "Is Denny in?"
. "Denny V said the surprised woman.
•My Denny? No, he's not in. Is the
i bjp here?"
"Sure it is. And Denny's not got
home yet? That's quare— unless some
thing has happened him."
"What would happen him?" Mrs. Mc-
Carthy asked anxiously.
"There's plenty of thugs can happen
a man," said Larry delicately. "He
might have got hurted or he might
have took sick with the fever. But
there's one comfort, as Father McGin
nls said once, and that is that time
heals iv'ry grief."
"What do you mane, Mr. O'Brien?"
"I mane that if anything happened
to Denny you wouldn't feel . as bad
about it a few [ months after it hap
pened as you would right at the time,
would you?"-'
• "I suppose not," Bald Mrs. McCarthy.
"I mind whin I lost me first husband I
thought I'd never get over it But, as
you say, in a few months it was alsler
to bear."
"Then, Mrs. McCarthy, you'll be glad
to know that it's now four months—
nearly five— since' Denny died. Sure, it
can't grieve you now as much as It
would if you'd known It at the time."
Spain's Migratory Sheep.
There are about 10,000,000 migratory
sheep In Spain, which each year travel
as much as 200 miles from the plains to
the mountains. They are known as
transhumantes, and their march, rest
ing places and behavior are governed
by special regulations, dating from the
fourteenth century. At certain times
no one may travel the same route as
the sheep', which have the right to
graze on all open and common land on
the way. For this purpose a road nine
ty yards wide must be left on all in
closed and private property. The shep
herds lead their flocks, which follow
after and around. The flocks are ac
companied by provision mules and by
large dogs to guard against wolves.
Tbe merino sheep travel 400 miles to
the mountains, and the total time spent
on the migration there and back Is
fourteen weeks.
Bribery In Elections.
Bribery in elections is an ancient 11
not an honorable custom. This is shown
in the case of Shrewsbury, England.
An extract from Parry's "Parliaments
and Councils of England" of a cajse of
bribery, with its punishment,' in 1571
shows how long the pernicious custom
has been in practice: "Thomas Long, 'a
very simple man and unfit' to serve, is
questioned bow he came to be elected.
*He confesses tbafc be gave tbe mayor
of Westbury and another £4 for his
place. They are ordered to repay this
sum, and a fine of £20 is to be assessed
on the corporation and Inhabitants, of
Westbury for their scandalous at
tempt." One can imagine the indigna
tion of those Inhabitants of Shrews
bury who rocelve<l no bribe having to
pay a fine for those who did.
Qaeer Looking Worm*
New Zealand, Australia, the Samoan
and the Solomon islands, as well as
portions of the Hawaiian group, are
the homes of various species of worms
with thick, heavy bodies and with a
well defined neck connecting the body
with a head that Is a startling remind
er of that of the monkey. ' In the Sand
wich Islands they are called "me-ta-ln
kl," which means "creeper with a
child's head." An old New Zealand leg
end say 8 that at one time they were
of Immense proportions and threatened
the extinction of all human life on the
Islands.
Prudence and Prevention.
The following quaintly worded notice
is posted outside the offices of one of
the street car companies of Paris: "We
beg to Inform burglars that we do not
leave money or valuables In any of our
depots during the night. You are re
quested to make known this fact
among the confraternity, so as to avoid
unnecessary trouble and loss of time."
The newspaper which publishes the
above adds, "Prudence and prevention
are the two mothers of safety." ■
A Natural Mistake.
He had recited to bis class the story
of Abraham entertaining angels una
ware. Feeling that the children might
not know the meaning of the word "un
aware," he asked them if they did. One
little band went up promptly, and the
smallest girl in the class said: .
"The thing you wear next your skin."

Retort.
Husband (irritably) — It isn't a year
Elnce you said you believed our mar
riage was made In heaven, and yet you
order me around as if I wasn't any
body.
i Wife (calmly)— Order is heaven's first
law.— New York Weekly.
You will find that the mere resolve
to be useless and tbe honest desire to
help other people will, in the quickest
and most delicate ways, also Improve
yourself. < ?

DOING THE GRAND ENTRY.
Doty a Circus Horse Enjoys His Part
of the Performance.
j ' ; experiences of a farm horse that
i: • -eetedly Joins a wagon show circus
in described by Sewell Ford in "Horses
Nine." Calico is the name of the horse.
At night he has a hard time pulling the
baud wnpon over the country roads, but
ho thoroughly enjoys his part in the
performance under the main tent The
enthor describes Calico's feelings .as
follows:
Ah, that grand entry! That was
something to live for. No matter how
bad the roads or , how hard the hills
hml b«eu. Calico forgot It all during
thos9 ten delightful minutes when, with
his heart beating time to the rat-tat-tat
of the snare drum, he swung prancing
ly around the yellow arena.
It all began in tbe dressing tent with
a period of confusion in which horses
were crowded together as thick as they
'could stand, while the riders dressed
ard mounted in frantic haste, for to be
late meant to be fined. .At last the-rtng
master clapped his bands as a sign that
all was in readiness. There was a mo
mentary hush. Then a bugle sounded,
the flaps were thrown back, and to the
crashing accompaniment of the band
the seemingly chaotic mass unfolded
into a double line as the horses broke
into a sharp gallop around the freshly
dug ring. ,
Tbe first time Calico did the grand
entry he felt as though he had. been
sucked into a whirlpool and was being
carried around by some irresistible
force. So dazed was he by the music,
by the hum of human voices and by
the unfamiliar sights that he forgot
to rear and kick. He could only prance
and snort. He went forward because
the rider of the outside horse dragged
him along by the bridle rein. Around
and around he circled until be lost all
sense of direction, and when he was
finally shunted out through the dress
ing tent flaps be was so dizzy he could
scarcely stand.
The Candle Fish.
One of the piscatorial curiosities of
the north i Pacific coast, especially plen
tiful along the shores of British Colum
bia, is the fish known to Indians, whites
and half breeds as the "candle fish."
To. the scientists he Is the eulachon
(Tbalelcbthys paclflcus), and Is highly
esteemed for two reasons. The fish it
self is about fourteen inches long, re
sembles the smelt In general appear
ances and is caught In large quantities
by .west coast fishermen during tbe
months of February, March and April.
It is the fattest of all fishes, for which
reason large' numbers of them are
dried and smoked to be used as a warm-
Ing food during the long rigorous win
ters so common in that region.
- Large numbers of them are also run
through crude presses, which extract
the oil. This is preserved in skin bags
and used much in the same manner as
whale's blubber is used by the Eski
mos. This "candle fish" gets its com
mon name i from ; tbe fact that when
dried it burns with a bright white
flame until entirely consumed. It is
much used by. the "coasters" both of
Columbia and Alaska, either with or
without a wick passed through Its
body. J-v.;- .;\;:
An Ancient Colt.
One of Mrs. Grant's favorite stories
was of an experience In camp some
where in the Adirondack^, when her
husband, then president for the first
term, wanted to get away from Wash
ington officialdom. Mrs. Grant was
bothered about the washing. A guide
recommended a woman who had seen
better days, who lived a little way
down the lake. Mrs. Grant engaged
her. Two days afterward she saw a
scene that, as she expressed it, re
minded her of ■ "Elaine." It was her
washerwoman paddling in a dugout be
hind a heap of snowy linen.
"Less 'n a year ago," said the woman
apologetically, "I wouldn't had to 'a*
used the boat. I brung it by the colt
But one day he jes' got colic or some
thin' and rolled over on the grass and
died. My, how we miss that colt! We'd
had him for twenty years."
The Cat and the Doughnuts.
This is a true story,- says a writer,
that my grandmother told me about
her cat and dog. She used to find the
cover off her doughnut jar, and also no
ticed that her doughnuts disappeared.
One day she beard a noise and found
that the cat was on the shelf where the
doughnuts were kept Then it put Its
paw in the jar and drew out a dough
nut and pushed it off the shelf, and the
dog, who was looking up at the cat,
caught the doughnut in his mouth and
ate it When they found they were
caught, they acted very guiltily.' :
Why Frenchmen Are Small.
It is said that the under size of the
French and their physical shortcom
ings as a nation are due for tbe most
part to the heavy drain made upon the
race by Napoleon. All the ablebodied
men were enrolled in his service, leav
ing none at domestic or business pur
suits except the extremely youthful or
the aged. From this drainage of the
blood and destruction of the sinew of
the race France has not yet recovered.
