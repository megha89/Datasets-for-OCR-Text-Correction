TRICKS OF THE TRADE.
Cups, Brushes and Sponges That Are
Left In Barber Shops.
"What becomes of all the old shav
ing mugs?" was the question asked the
barber.
"What becomes of the owners?" was
the response.
Neither side seemed disposed to an
swer the query, and there was an awk
ward silence. The barber slapped his
razor on the strop, smeared some extra
lather on the victim's mouth so he
wouldn't be; lnclined to interrupt and
said In a stage whisper:
"Now, I'll tell you, but I don't want
It shouted from the housetops. We
use the mugs again."
He paused and sighed as he tossed
the questioner's head the other way. .
"Yes," he continued, "we use them
ngaln. We don't like to lose custom
ers; but. if we must lose them, why, we
don't mind If they leave their cups,
etc., behind. It's surprising how many
do; but then, barbers do mostly a
'shifting trade. 1 It's no secret that we
urge customers to have their own cup
Most of them are satisfied if they have
a private cup, brush and sponge. We
supply them with the man's name on
the cup for $1.50, and our profit on the
transaction is 50 cents. When a man
has a razor and comb and brush be
tides the other tools, he generally takes
the whole' lot away when he's leaving,
but countless cups, brushes and
sponges are left behind In every barber
shop.
. "The cups are always good. Many of
them contain such common names as
John Smith, William Jones, etc., and
when some other John Smith or Wil
liam Jones orders a cup we simply sup
ply him with the cast off one. Some
times they need a littlle touching up
with gilding; but on the whole. It's
very profitable.

use them on the transients."— New

HE SAVED THE SCOW
A CLEVER BIT OF STRATEGY IN AN
ENGINEERING JOB.
How a Young American Engineer
Brought His Spirit of Invention to
Aid In Solving a Wreck Problem In
South America.
"It Is easy enough for an engineer, to
•how ability In New_York or In other
big towns where be can get about all
the tools and conveniences ever devis
ed. It is when an engineer finds him
self In the wilds of a Jungle or up In
the mountains, hundreds of miles from
civilization, that his own natural in
genuity and Invention count," said a
veteran engineer to a youngster who
had been admitted to the ranks of the
Engineers' club.
"Down In Surinam, Dutch Guiana,
where the arrival of a sailing schooner
causes a sensation, where a mall
steamer enters the muddy harbor once
In two weeks to tarry two hours to get
rid of Its' mail and to take on a few
passengers, there was once a young
American engineer who showed that
he had the proper spirit of invention' to
advance him to the front ranks of the
profession. Like all the best Inven
tions, bis was the simplest one, and it
was one that was widely talked about
among the profession to the credit of
the Inventor.
"To understand the story properly
you Seed a trifling insight into Suri
nam and its habits. Here Indians may
be seen on the streets wearing only a
breechcloth. The white population |is
so scarce that all are thrown together
as if in one large family. Englishmen,
Americans, Germans, Dutchmen and
Frenchmen all combining together and
forming clubs and society to keep
themselves from dying of sheer lone
someness.
"In this primitive town there was a
man who held the splendid monopoly
of owning a large scow. That, up
there, seems a remarkably small thing
to be proud of, but the value of even a
scow depends entirely upon where the
scow Is and what It will cost to replace
it This particular scow bad been built
by American' ship carpenters sent es
pecially from the United States at
great expense. There was not another
scow in the entire harbor, and about
all of the heavy river work to be done
for the city and plantations and min
ing companies was done by this one
vessel. Its loss, therefore, would have
been not only a severe one for the own
er, who bud a monopoly of the busi
ness In those days, but it would have
been little short of a national calam
ity. "
, "One day, while the scow was an
chored *In midstream, * one of those
smashing black squalls for which the
tropics are famous broke over the riv
er, and for twenty minutes you could
not see ten feet away or bear a man
shouting at your elbow. When the
storm finally abated, the scow was not
to be seen, and It was found she bad
gone down, deck load and all. To most
of us there seemed about as much
chance of raising the vessel as there
would be to raise an oceau steamer
sunk in the middle of the Atlantic.
"It was about this time that the
young engineer took a hand la the
problem. He asked the dimensions of
the scow and was told that It was 1 12
by GO feet, and then he announced that
If the owner would provide him with
four men he would raise the scow for
a certain sum of money. The bargain
was made, though the contractor re
fused to say how he would go about
the Job.
"Now, you must know that aside
from the ebb and flood tide, which al
ternate eyery six hours, there Is also
what Is known as a spring tide. This
comes with the full of the moon, and it
has the effect of making a higher flood
tide than any during the month. The
opposite to the spring tide is the neap
tide, and that happens at the dark of
the moon, with the effect that at no
other tide during the month Is the ebb
tide so low as It Is at that time. The
difference in the height of water be
tween the ebb at neap tide and the
flood at spring tide is considerable.
"The engineer waited until neap tide.
On that day he towed a number of logs
down the river. These' be anchored
over the scow and sent men below to
fasten chains to one side of the scow,
and these be fastened to the logs on
the surface. Then he waited patiently.
As the spring tide approached he tow
ed other logs down the river until be
had enough to make quite a rnft. and
on the day of the highest tide all the
logs were tied together and fnstened.
The tide rose steadily, and the more it
rose the more the raft went down un
der the strain of the pull on the chains.
At last, just as it seemed that the raft
was unequal to the occasion. It was
seen to bob up violently, and n moment
later there was a commotion in the
water, and the scow appeared. What
had happened, of course, was this: Thp
chains pulling upward on one side of
the scow tilted It more and more until
the deck load began to slide off. and
finally, wheu all the stones bad slid in
to the river, the scow came up under
Its own buoyancy. The remainder was
simple. The vessel was towed to the
shore, where it was hauled up on the
sand, and when the water receded
holes bored into the bull caused the
scow to empty. Later the holes were
plugged up again, and the old ship was
as fine as silk."— New York Times.

He Cansht the Car.
The man dashed down the street aft
er the retreating State street car.
Every muscle was strained; his
breath came In quick gasps; the beads
of moisture stood out upon his ■ fore-^
head. His feet were working like the*
pedals on a bicycle. He only touched
the ground iv the more nltitudinous
places. >'i*s**
"I'll— catch— that— street— car." he
gasped, "or die."
Faster' went the street car. Faster
went the man.

He collided with a baby buggy. The

pointed a finger at the disappearing

hissed through her clinched teeth.

Ate fZS.OOO Worth of Lifer.
Among the many poker stories afloat
a good one Is told concerning Dutch
Hank, a well known player of Roch
ester, N. T. Hank went Into Daly's
place. In New York city, one day and
sat In a game, winning $25,000 with
very little trouble. Then he rose to
go, thinking It was time to stop. Daly
shook bands with him nnd asked him
what was his hurry. Hank said, he
would have to go to a Dutch restau
rant he knew where they always cook
ed liver In a way that he particularly
liked.
"Oh, If that's all." said Daly. "Just
stay here. We can serve the liver Just
that way, and you can go right on
playing."
Dutch Hank had left some friends
outside waiting, but he said he would
stay and eat the liver. He sat down
and ate and played. His $25,000 soon
went back to Daly In a turn of luck.
Hank went out without a cent
"What kept you so long?" his friends
demanded. -^ '■■"■■;»■ .:
"Well, you don't suppose a man can
eat $25,000 -worth of liver In a minute,
do you?" was the retort of Hank.
The Tempter Won.
When the late Baron Nordenskjold
was at Ceylon on the way home from
his Journey along the northern coast of
Siberia, he received a telegram from
the Russian government asking him
whether he would accept from the czar
a certain decoration as an appreciation
of his services to Russia. For many
days the famous explorer wavered, as
he was a member of Bjorsterno Rjorn-
Bon's Antidecoratlon club, whose mem
bers were solemnly pledged never to
accept any decoration from anybody.
Nordenskjold, however, could not re
sist the temptation, so he replied to the
telegram In the affirmative.
It is not hard to Imagine his disap
pointment when, upon reaching home,
a friend of his, a high official, tokl him
the following: "The Russian govern
ment was well aware of your antago
nistic views In regard to decorations
and had, therefore, placed In readiness
300,000 rubles to be paid you In the
event of your refusing to accept the
Insignia, but before paying that sum
they wanted to try your firmness. Rus
sia Is certainly grateful to you for your
failure to live up to 'your pledge."
The Lamps of the Son.
Many kinds of Jellyfish are phos
phorescent at night and present n won
derfully beautiful appearance when
slowly moving through the water, and
It Is this phosphorescence which lias
given them the poetic title of "the
lamps of the sea." They are not less
beautiful In the daytime, for most of
the species are striped or tinted, some
being melon shaped, with rows of
fringes dividing the sections. The ten
tacles are often plumed, and, while
waving- about In graceful curves, at
tract or gather In the food of the ani
mal. The "Portuguese man-of-war" is
probably the best known, as well as
most attractive In form, of the whole
family.

"Did it have your name on It?"
"Xes, and my husband's name too."
"That's just like selfish men. He
must share the gift with you."
"But he didn't"
"What was his name doing on it
then?"
"It wouldn't have been any good
without it' It was a check."
What's In a Name!
Voltaire under a fictitious name of
fered to the Comcdie Francaise a play
entitled "Le Drolt dv Seigneur.?' It
was promptly rejected as badly
ten and poor In rhyme, but when he
offered the same manuscript a second
time under the tlUe of "L'Ecueil dv
Sage" and signed with his own name It
was accepted with enthusiasm and uni
versally declared admirable.

QUAINT COLLEGE LAWS.
ttnlea Prescribing the Dress of Har
. yard Students la Bygone Days.
The curious laws regarding students'
Iress which prevailed at Harvard up to
the middle of the last century are lllus
rated by two eighteenth century waist-
Mats which are among the collections
i>f the Boston Art museum. One was
tvorn by a member of the class of 1740
»nd the other by his son In 1784.
The latter waistcoat Is olive green In
tolor, conforming to the college regula
tions, which required either blue gray,
plain black, "nankeen"— a kind of buff
-or olive. The coat and breeches which
originally went with It, as one may
read in the old time Harvard "Law«,J
tvere blue gray. Freshmen of that date
were allowed only plain buttonholes,
sophomores leaped to the dignity of
kavlng buttons on thei» cuffs. Junior*-
Uight have inexpensive frogs to their
auttonholes except that they might not
jiave them on their cuff buttonholes,
"and the senior enjoyed frogs, button
aoles and buttons complete. Seniors
md Juniors were permitted also to
wear black Oxford gowns, such as are
svorn at graduation today, and a "night
jown," or dressing gown, was per
missible on certain unimportant occa
sions. It cost "not more than 10 shll-
Jngs" for every appearance of gold or
silver adornment.
The rules of costume were changed,
3f course, from time to time. In 1828»
for example, the prescribed dress con
sisted of a black mixed coat, single
breasted, "with a rolling cape square
at the end and with pocket flaps, the
waist reaching to the natural waist,
with lapels of the same length." It is
explained that "black mixed," called
nlso Oxford mixed, was black with not
more than one-twentieth nor less than
one-twenty-fifth part of white. The
senior was allowed to support his dig
nity with three "crow's feet" of black
silk cord on the lower part of hip coat
sleeve. Two crow's feet were permitted
to the Junior, one to the sophomore nnd
none at all to the freshmau. The waist
coat was of black mixed or of black or,
Then of cotton or linen fabric, of white;
single breasted, with a standing collar.
The pantaloons were of black mixed.

A Rattlesnake* Fnngs.
You ofton hear of rendering a rattle
snake harmless by pulling out Its
fangs. Then, again, you read of cases
where a serpent so treated has bitten
persons fatally. The reason for this Is
that a poisonous snake Is deprived only
temporarily of its veriomous powers by
the extraction of the two incisors In
the upper jaw, at the bases of which
are the poison glands. Of course you '
know that the fangs are hollow, so
that when the animal strikes the veil-
om gushes through them Into the flesh
of the person struck. Now. by draw
ing the two teeth . the snake may be
rendered harmless for a few weeks,
but after a short time the two teeth
just behind the original fangs move up
and take their places,' making connec
tion with the poison glands and thus
becoming poison' fangs as good and ef
fective as the old ones.
Horses and Cold.
Colonel Sir T. H. Holdlch; writing In
The Indian Borderland" of the terrible
storms and wind and snow which over
take the traveler on tbe high' passes of
the Herat mountains, remarks on the
superior power of tbe horse to ', with
stand cold. In one such Btorm "over
twenty men perished and many mules.
All the dogs with the caravan t were
lead, but, so far as I can ■ remember,
no horses. Yet some of the chargers of
the Eleventh Bengal lancers got slowly
aii their legs tbe day after the blizzard
literally sheeted with Ice as an Ironclad
s sheeted with steel." It Is a fact worth
aoting that the horse will stand cold
ivhere a mule or a camel will not and
where a d^K will die.

Value of Education.
Once upon a time a crow t sat on a
high branch of a tree with a' large bit
of cheese in his mouth when an envi
ous and hungry fox came prowling
along and spied the choice morsel.
"You are a beautiful bird," said the
cunning fox, "and yet your great beau
ty Is not equal to your marvelous voice,
which charms all of the beasts of the
forest. Pray, Mrs. Crow, do let me
hear you sing."
The crow turned her head to one
side, as Is the habit with such birds,
and looked at Mr. Fox. Then she de
liberately ate the cheese and after
clearing her voice spoke. - :
"Thank you for your compliment
Mr. Fox," she said. "If you will wait
a minute, I will sing for you. I never
speak or sing until after dinner since
I have been reading ancient fables."

"shrewd, persistent fellows who are al

CLAIM FOR LEGAL SERVICES.
By the minutes of the board of
supervisors published in another col
umn, it will be seen that a claim for
$500 was allowed "W. J. McGee for
legal services rendered in the case of
Jackson School Trustees vs. C. L.
Culbert, auditor. The suit was
brought to decide the issue whether
the supervisors had discretionary
powers in fixing the tax for school
purposes at a lower rate than would
be necessary to raise the sum of $6
per census child, which the law es
tablishes as the minimum limit. Suit
was brought over three years ago.
It is the duty of the district attorney
to attend to all civil litigation in
which the county is interested. He
was elected for that purpose, and
is paid a salary for such services.
Whether the supervisors have any
authority to employ another attor
ney at public expense we are not
prepared to say. It is only reason
able to suppose that such power — if
vested iv them at all — can only be
exercised upon the request of the
district attorney for assistance in
any particular case. However, Mr.
McGee conducted the suit in both
the superior and supreme courts, and
won out. The decision in the su
preme court it appears turned on a
technicality, so that the real merit
of . the controversy remains undeter
mined.
Now for the claims for legal ser
vices. Over a year ago the follow
ing bill was presented by Mr McGee:
To legal services rendered and
expenses incurred in Jackson .
school district vs. C. L. Cul
bert, auditor — superior and
supreme courts $200 00
Money paid in above case to
assistant counsel 50 00
$250 00
Although the separate charge for
associate counsel is remarkable, still
the claim as a whole cannot be said
to be extravagant. It was promptly
passed and paid. No doubt the sup
ervisors in allowing the bill consid
ered it a settlement in full of all de
mands arising out of that suit. It
is not usual to present bills of that
kind in sections. There is nothing
in the bill itself to indicate that it
is merely a partial settlement. But
at the December meeting of the
board of supervisors the follow
ing claim bobs up serenely for con
sideration:
To legal services rendered in the
supreme court in the case of
Jackson school district et al vs.
C. L. Culbert, county auditor,
expenses incurred and fees paid
associate counsel $500 00
The same ground apparently was
covered by the previously allowed
claim. The law as it now stands re
quires that claims against the coun
ty be first submitted to the district
attorney for his indorsement as to
whether or not the same is a legal
charge. This $500 bill is not in
dorsed in any manner by the district
attorney. The plain inference is
that he could not recommend it as
a legal demand. True, he did not in
express words disapprove it. • Nor
does it appear from the minutes that
he appeared before the board and
opposed the bill. The law imposes
this duty upon him in regard to all
claims which in his judgment are il
. legal. But the fact that it was not
indorsed by the proper officer ought
to have raised a sufficient presump
tion to have caused its rejection, un
less that presumption was overcome
in other ways. The bill was with
drawn at the January meeting, but
was brought forward again at the
meeting this week and passed, and
. in a few minutes thereafter the war
rant was cashed in the treasurer's
office. A protest would inevitably
have involved a' suit in court for its
collection.
Thus the sum of $750 has been paid
for this litigation. Not only special
counsel, but an assistant special
counsel, whose name does not ap
pear, has drawn money from the
county treasury for legal services on
account of this suit. To say that
the whole affair shapes itself as ex
traordinary from our view-point is
putting it mildly. We cannot ex
plain it. The offer to defend other
suits that may be brought hereafter
involving the same issue free of
charge, serves only to intensify the
extraordinary features of this re
markable proceeding. It is our duty
to lay the facts before our readers
as far as we understand them. This
we have dome. There may be others
who are able to throw additional
light on this 'subject, and thoreby
help to explain some of its features;
if so we shall be pleased to hear from
them.
THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR.
The strenous efforts that are being
made to secure the friendly offices of
other nations to bring the war in
South Africa to a- close, indicate
the Boers have about reached the
limit of their resistance. That they
have put up a gallant fight against
the might of the British empire must
be conceded by all. In a conflict
between two nations, the sympathy
of outsiders is usually enlisted, often
regardless of the merits of the con
troversy, in behalf of the weaker
side. There is no doubt that the
Boers have now, as they have had
from the start, the moral support of
the masses in both Europe and
America in their struggle for. inde
pendence. While the independence
of the two republics was not in issue
prior to the clash of arms, the firing
of the first gun immedjately raised
that issue. The Boers understood
that victory for them meant the ex
tension of Africander ' sway over the
whole of South Africa, while defeat
meant the wiping of the two repub
lics from the list of nations. ThesucU
den wealth that came to the Trans
vaal as the result- of the discovery
of the greatest gold-bearing reefs in
the world, made the ruling class
ambitious. Dreams of supremacy
took possession of them. Success
having crowned their efforts in two
or three minor clashes with British
troops, they believed they were able,
on their own veldt and kopjes at
least, to withstand the whole might
of the empire. But they were mis
taken. They risked their all in the
terrible game of war, and lost. Their
country is devasted, their homes are
in rums, and most of their people are
in captivity. A few roving bands of
desperate men still make a show of
resistance, but the end of even this
kind of senseless warfare is evidently
not far off. The few fighting men
still in the field realize this, and
hence the efforts of sympathizers out
side the theatre of war to bring
the conflict to an end. Great Brit
ain is more than anxious to close the
war. Considering the forces arraj'ed
against each other, it is the most
costly war of history. Tt has proved
beyond question that the pace of
war between civilized people in these
days is too costly for the wealthiest
nations to maintain for any length
of time. But too much blood and
treasure have been poured out to
admit of peace except on a stable
and lasting basis. Concession — na
turally interpreted as indicative of
weakness — has been the bane of
South Africa from the standpoint
of British diplomacy. The vascil
lating policy of years ago is respon
sible for the present life and death
struggle. "Peace at any price," is
not now the watchword. When peace
comes it must definitely settle the
race problem in South Africa. Nor
is it probable that the war will trans
mit to posterity a legacy of undying
hatred between Boer and Briton.
When the question of paramountcy
is reaioved, the two races will no
doubt work harmoniously in the
development of one of the richest
mineral regions of tlie globe. The
sacrifices which have been made oh
either side will create respect one for
the other. Both sides want peace,
but while this is true, it is also clear
that the British government is more
concerned that the terms of peace
shall be such that the terrible bap
tism of blood through which the
dark continent has passed shall not
have been in vain.

Clerk's Wise Suggestion.
"I have lately been much troubled
with dyspepsia, belching and sour
stomach," writes M. S. Mead, leading
pharmacist of Attleboro, Mass. "I
could eat hardly anything without suf
fering several hours. My clerk sug
gested I try Kodol Dyspepsia Cure
which I did with most happy results.
I have had no more trouble and when
ones can go to eating mince pie, cheese,
candy and nuts after such a time, their
digestion must bo pretty good. I en
dorse Kodol Dyspepsia Cure heartily."
You don't.havo to diet. Eat all the
good food you want but don't over
load the stomach. Kodol Dyspepsia
Cure digests your food. Korr's Phar

Saved Him From Torture.
There is no more agonizing trouble
than piles. The constant itching and
burning make life intolerable. No
position is comfortable. The torturo
is unceasing. Do Witt's Witch Hazel
Salve cures piles at once. For skin
diseases, cuts, burns, bruises, all kinds
of wounds it ,is unequalled. J. S.
Gerall, St. Paul, Ark., says: "From
1865 I suffered with the protruding,
bleeding piles and could find nothing
to help me until I used De Witt's
Witch Hazel Salve. A few boxes com
pletely cured me." Beware of counter
feits. Kerr's Pharmacy, Jackson.

Several evenings this weeks a few
persons might have been noticed on the
streets of Jackson, grotesquely attired
and masked. The explanation is that
it is the carnival season, which includes
the week before Lent. In Italy and

Gras is the festival of the year from a
fun-loving standpoint, and those who
have participated in these frolics in the
older countries, have a yearning to re
new the pleasure whenever the season
rolls round.
As Dr Endicott was proceeding to
lone on horseback Saturday night he
met with an accident which fortunately
was not attended with any serious re
sults. The night was dark. When
near Ke'-r's station, his horse stumbled
and fell. The doctor's foot was some
how wrenched, but he was able to con
tinue his journey. Next morning, how
ever, be was unable to bear any weight
upon the injured foot, and riding back
to Jackson was out of the question.
He returned in a buggy Sunday, and
on reaching here the soreness had al
most entirely disappeared. Next day
he was able to move about as well as
before the accident. . '
The meeting that was announced to
be held in the supervisor's room last
Saturday to consider the proposition
of taking up the water pipe laid along
the lone road for sprinkling purposes
last summer, did not materialize.
There were not enough present to do
any business, so the whole matter
went by the board. Nevertheless, the
sentiment at this end of the line at
least, is strongly in favor of selling all
the sprinkling outfit. It is thought
that the money can be SDent to better
advantage in improving the road in
other ways.
William H. George was in Jackson
the latter part of last week and the
early part of this week. He represents
the Realty Syndicate of ' Oakland, a
company that controls all the street
car lines of Oakland, and owns vast
tracts of real estate near that city.
His mission to Amador county is. for
the purpose of selling certificates or
bonds of the company bearing six per
cent interest. The company is work-
Ing with the Santa Fe people in secur
ing an outlet for their road along the.
water front of Oakland, and is con
structing a ferry slip parallel to the
Southern Pacific opposite Goat Island.
Mr. George was very successful in plac
ing blocks of certificates in this county.
Those, who have invested heretofore
speak in high terms of the business
methods of the management and the
value of the securities.
Collection of Deer Antlers.
Sheriff Gregory has secured from a
party recently from Oregon the finest
collection of deer antlers ever brought
to this county, and probably ever seen
in the state. The collection shows the
antlers in every stage of development,
from the infant sprout of the now horn,
showing a mere lump on the head, to
the period when the animal is on the
point of shedding its horns. Such a
collection ought to be quite valuable
from a scientific point of view. The
deers which furnished this collection
were all killed in Oregon. The portions
of the skull carrying the antlers are.
nicely mounted, and preserved in ac
cordance with the best methods. The
party from whom he bought the set,
which embraces 27 pieces, was pressed
for money and sick, and hence offered
his collection for a small amount, and
Mr. Gregory boughLtho same for tho
novelty of the thing, and without hav
ing any use for the same himself. It
would certainly be a fine assortment
for a museum.
The Rainfall.
Rain fell during Saturday night in
Jackson to the amount of .68 of an
inch, making the total for the season
to date 12.79 inches, against 19.41 for
last year, and 11.77 for 1899-1900,
While the rainfall is considerably below
the average so far, we have had seasons
in which the precipitation has been
less. Up to February 28, 1899, the
rainfall for that season was 11.09, but
in March the same year over 12 inches
fell.
A Malicious Act.
[Calareras Chronicle, Jan. 25.)
On Friday night of last week some
evil-minded miscreant shot and killed,
with a rifle bullet, one of George
Bowser's best horses, at his ranch, the
Kenross, at Whisky Slide. The animal
was a beautiful Morgan mare and
worth at least $125. She was in fine
condition, as sound as a dollar and as
fine an animal as one could wish to see.
Mr. Bowser believes it was done with
malice pretense and that the devil in
human form picked out the very best
animal in the band upon which to vent
his spleen against the owner. If that
is the case the act is certainly abomin
able and the miscreant is deserving of
the severest retribution.
THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSON, CAIiITOKJSIA, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1902.
THE PRODUCERS OF GOLD
Full Force the Order at
v the Zeila.
Entire Works of the Keystone to be
Ban by Compressed Air.— The
Kirkwood at a Standstill.
Kirkwood. — We reported last week
that steps had been taken to reorganize
this company, under a new manage
ment, and proceed to do considerable
development work to the west of the
shaft. E. H. Harrington and others
were willing to invest in the undertak
ing, if satisfactory arrangements could
be made to secure the necessary ex
tension of time. It was shown that in
order to carry out tbo plans proposed,
it would be necessary^ to get a bond for
five years. This the owner of the
ground seemed unwilling to give; four
years was the utmost time he was pre
pared to concede. In this shape the
matter stands. It is hoped that the
property will not be allowed to lapse
into idloiiess for the sake of one year's
time. Those behind the movement
has the utmost confidence that the
ledge will be found to the west. Too
much money has been expended already
to let the mine drop without further
prospecting. -..'* ■ >'
We have since learned that a five
year bond has been secured and opera
tions will be resumed shortly.
„ Lincoln. — In conversation with E.
C. Voorheis, the president of this com
pany, we were informed that the shaft
is down 1830 feet. It is the intention
to sink to 2000 feet before drifting. It
will be throe months before sinking is
finished.
Keystone.— lt is the intention to
run the entire works by compressed
air, and use electric energy to compress
the air. A fine equipment is being put
in place for this purpose. The addi
tion to the mill is making satisfactory
headway. Everything is being done
in the most substantial manner,' with
cement floods and concrete battery
blocks.
Bunker Hill.— The drifting opera
tions have revealed a large amount of
low grade ore,, but too poor to mill.
The rock looks well, but carries little
gold. It is tho intention to run several
hundred feet further on the vein in
tho hope that the ore will improve in
Saenandoah. — At the Shenandoah
mine work is progressing very satis
factorily under the able management
of superintendent S. K. Thornton.
After sinking to a depth of 500 feet a
drift was run south a distance of 1000
feet, then a raise to the surface. Here
a hoisting plant has been erected with
capacity for sinking 1500 feet, air com
pressors installed, and all in readiness
to sink to a depth of 1000 feet (500 feet
deeper than the bottom of the raise)
with all possible speed. The location
of the mine and the quality of the ore,
together with the management and
backing of tho company, is good as
surance that in the near future the
Shenandoah will become a dividend
payer, which will exert an influence
over the Plymouth mining district
that will tend toward placing the min
ing properties of this district upon the
same plane as in former years.
Zeila. — The repairs to the shaft are
about completed, and both mine and
mill will resume operations with a full
force in two or three days at the
furthest. This is by long odds the
quickest repairing work ever done to
the Zeila shaft, involving a shutdown
of only a couple of months. On other
occasions the work has taken at least
four or five months, and sometimes
much longer.
A Serious Accident.
A serious misfortune befell John
Fopiano on the lone road last Satur
day. He was accompanying the 10
mule team of A. Piccardo, loaded with
50 sacks of sulphurets, and bound for
lone. John Cupps was driving the
team, while Fopiano was riding one of
the wheel horses. The driver threw a
rock at one of the mules, and in the
stampede caused thereby, Fopiano was
thrown off, and one of the wheels pass
ed over his right ankle, crushing the
ankle badly, and breaking both bones
above the ankle. The accident occur
red near the junction of the Buena
Vista and lone roads. The victim was
brought to tho hospital as soon as pos
sible, and his injuries were attended to
by Dr. Gall. Every effort will be made
to save the foot. So far he is getting
along nicely. Fopiano has been em
ployed for years around Miller's sta
tion on the lone road. Under- the
most favorable circumstances months
must elapse before he will be able to
get around again.'
Views of Standard Electric Works.
We were shown this week by Geo.
McMillan, the well known photo
grapher of Jackson, an album contain
ing 50 views of all the points of interest
on the line of the Standard Company's
works. The scenes embraces bird's
eye view of Jackson from Kennedy
heights, also of the Zeila works, and
then from the power house at Electra
clear up to the head of the ditch at
Mill creek. The pictures are Bxlo
inches in size, and were taken express
ly for the company, and give some idea
of the immensity of the undertaking
that has been pressed almost to the
point of completion within our borders.
They are taken in the best style of the
photographer's art, which may be
said of all work turned out by this
artist.

Obituary.
Catherine Harker died in tho Ama
dor county hospital last Friday morn
ing. She had been bedridden for some
time. Friday morning assistants went
to raise her up in bed, when she was
stricken with death, passing away in a
few minutes. Deceased was well-known
in the eastern section of the county,
having lived at the old Harker station
on the Amador wagon road for many
years. She was born in Germany in
1825, and emigrated to California in
1851, first residing in Placerville, where
she remained until 1855. In the latter
year she moved with her husband to
Amador county, on what has been
known so long as the Harker ranch,
where she remained until her husband, '
John Harker, died. Although possessed
of means, she became an inmate of the
hospital, as a paid patient, not long
after her husband's death. She leaves
three children — one son and two daugh
ters — one of the latter being a resident
of Portland, Oregon. The remains
were taken to Volcano, where the
funeral took place last Sunday.
A Good Appointment.
Dr. C. A. Herrick, the woll known
dentist of Jackson, was notified Tues
day, that he had been appointed by
Governor Gago as membor of the Stale
Board of Dental Examiners, vice F. J.
Bethel, resigned. The appointment
came as a surprise, and all tbo more
gratefully accepted on that account.
Certainly, the appointment was not
made with a brass band accompaniment. >
No petition whatever had been gotten
up in this behalf. It was simply made
known through private channels that
our townsman would like the placo and
was well qualified to fulfill its duties,
and he was promptly appointed. The
office is an honorary one. No salary is
attached to it. The graduates of the
dental colleges are required by the law
to pass a strict examiuation at the
hands of the state board of examiners
before being entitled to practice their
profession. The examiuation is held
either annually or semi-annually, and
requires the attendance of the members
in San Francisco for about a week.
We congratulate the doctor on this
recognition of his standing in his pro-,
fession, and also because of his services
in the republican ranks, he having ably
filled the office of president of the Jack
son Republican Club for several years.
The Veerkamp Ranch.
The Veerkamp ranch of 360 acres,
on the road between lone and Sutter
Creek, has been purchased by the
Allen estate. Mrs. Veerkamp and her
father, Charles Neips, became involved
some time ago and the place was
turned over to Hiram Deacon of Sut
ler Creek as security. Mrs. Veerkamp
had until January 27th to pay Mr.
Deacon $4000.
On that day W. J. McGee, attorney
for the Allen estate, advanced the
money for Mrs. Veerkamp and took
title for the Allen estate.
Mrs. Veerkamp will continue to oc
cupy the place for the present. — Echo.
The foreclosure suit of Hiram J.
Deacon vs. Leona G. Veerkamp was
dismissed on the 25th of January.
Coroner's Inquest-
Coroner Gritton held an inquest on
the 24th of January on the body of
John Henry Shealor, who was found
dead in his cabin, about four miles east
of Sutter Creek, on the preceding day.
Deceased was a single man, and lived
alone. A nephew, John Lawrence
Shealor, visited tho cabin on the 23d
to see if be was all right. Ho had seen
him threo days before, and he appear
ed in his usual health. On the last oc
casion he found tho kitchen door open,
and saw the body lying on the floor.
No marks of violence were found, and
nothing to indicate that ho had died
from other than natural causes. He
had complained of a pain in tho region
of the heart. It is believed that he
died on the afternoon of tho 21st. The
jury, which consisted of the following
settlers, Grant Shealor, John Savage,
W. C. Rice, H. C. Hamrick, T. A.
Rice, and J. H. Weddlo, roturnod a
verdict that he died from natural
causes.

We hereby tender our heartfelt
thanks to all relatives and friends, and

Tho last Heard Of It-
"My little son took the croup one
night and soon grew so bad you could
hear him breathe all over the house, "
says F. D. Reynolds, Mansfield, O.

doses of One Minute Cough Cure quick
ly relieved him and he went to sleep.
That's the. lpt we heard of the croup.
Nqw isn't a cough euro like that val
uable?" One Minute Cough Cure Is
absolutely safe and acts immediately.
For coughs, colds, grip, bronchitis and
all other throat and lung troubles it is
a certain cure. Very pleasant to take.

Strange Facts About Animals.
Have you,ever noticed that all ani
mals whlcbjchewjthi'^i'ud are cloven
footed? Also that most of those which
drink water by Yuction are herbivorous,
tbp carnivorous variety lapping it with
the tongue, like the cat. dog. tiger, etc.
Sheep have:-no/ teeth In the upper jaw;
and -tortoises fand ' turtles are : without
altogether.' ~""* '- ~' t
Unlike most animals, horses have no
eyebrows, "and , bares /are minus 'eye
lids^ Consequently the eyes of the lat
ter cannot lie shut, and a thin mem
branous ■ substance -coders them * when
asleep.'-The eye of the owl Is also very
peculiar, swing that It is Immovably
fixed In its socket and cannot stir In
any direction. To compensate for this
seeming disadvantage it can turn its
head almost completely round without
moving Its body. If you were to keep
a frog's mouth open many minutes. It
would soon die, as owing to Its peculiar
construction It can only breathe with
the mouth closed.
On the other band, fishes arc com
pelled to keep opening and closing their
mouths In order to give their respira
tory organs full play. It Is also a
strange fact that the deer has addi
tional breathing places besides the nos
trils, as If nature had foreseen bis
great need of .free rosplratlon when
forced to flee before* tbp hounds. Snakes
usually have their teeth in the head,
but one variety in Africa, whose prin
cipal food Is eggs. Is- provided with a
substitute for them In Its stomach.
POULTRY POINTERS.
Ducks and geese need no grain when
they have plenty of grass.
Chicken fatten faster on cooked food
than on raw because It is more easily
digested. . . • •
Wlien soft feed is given to either
young or old fowls. It should never be
thrown on. the ground. :
When closely ■confined, the loose grain
fed to fowls should be scattered among
litter of some kind, so that they can
scratch It out . . •< .. ■■
-There is nothing 60 bad for the health
and well being of poultry as confining
them In close quarters and preventing
them from taking needed exercise.
One of the most important items to
Insure success in the hatching of chick
ens in winter Is to get the eggs from a
flock of healthy and vigorous fowls.
There is better health among roving
fowls because they get the food that Is
best for digestion and get the necessary
grit to help the gizzard do its work.
When necessary to administer medi
cine by placing it in the drinking wa
ter, keep the birds from drink for sev
eral hours. They are then thirsty and
more apt to get a good swallow..
The Laat Execution at Tybnrn.
The last execution. on a permanent
gallows in "London took place at Ty
burn on Nov. 7, 1783, the malefactor
being one John Austin, condemned for
highway robbery with violence. For
centuries .Tyburn had beeu the scene
of executions for criminals condemned
in Middlesex, and before the erection
of the permanent gibbet occasional
hangings had taken place, record exist-
InjJ of tlie hanging of Judge Tri'ssilian
and Nicholas Brembre at that place as
far back as 13S8.
The gallows consisted of tlirw |xists.
and around it were open galleries, re
sembling race stands, in which seats
were let. On account of the disgrace
ful scenes on the road, executions were
transferred In 1753 to the area in front
of Newgate, despite the objections of
residents, and on Dec. 3 of that year
the first hanging took place there,
when no less than ten were executed.—

The Cook's Cannonade.
The first thing that a lands-,
man; on a man-of-war Is the rigid
discipline every where. On
some, of. the ships' belonging to the
tropical countries, however, discipline
Is very la*.
. The Defense, a Haitian man-of-war,
was lying in i the harbor of Port au
Prince. One day a mess cook for
sonio reason cleaned nbout a peck of
knives and forks on the gun deck, and
being suddenly called away and no:
to spend time "to go to th«
galley.; heselzed tbe mers pot full of
knives' and forks and stuck it in tb<
muzzle of the ten inch gun, putting tht
tampion in after it.
About an hour afterward the admiral
came aboard, and as the gun was
loaded with blank cartridge they used
It to fire a salute!
It happened that the gun was aimed
toward the town, and almost point
blank at the Grand hotel. The guests
assembled on the porch to witness the
ceremonies, when they were Wluted
with a rain of knives and forks,
which stuck against the wooden walls
like quills on a porcupine.
Fortunately no one was hurt, al
though there were many narrow es
capes. \
How the Mistletoe Comes to Be.
The story of how the mistletoe gets
on the trees is a most interesting one.
Covering the mistletoe twigs are pearly
white' berries. These come in the win
ter season, when food is comparatively
scarce, and hence some of our birds
eat them freely. Now, when a robin
eats a cherry he swallows simply the
meat and flips the stone away. The
sded of the mistletoe the bird cannot
flip. It is sticky and holds to his_bill.
His only resource is to wipe It off, and
he does so, leaving it sticking to the
branches of the tree on which he is
sitting at the time.
This seed sprouts after a time, and,
not finding • earth— which, indeed, its
ancestral habit has made It cease want
ing—lt sinks Its roots Into the bark of
the tree and bunts there for the pipes
that carry the sap. . Now, the sap In
the bark is the very richest In the trc«,
far richer than that In the wood, and
the mistletoe gets from its host the
choicest of food. With a strange fore
sight It does not throw Its leaves away,
as do most parasites, but keeps them
to use In winter, when the tree Is leaf
less. — Professor S. O. Schmucker in
Ladies' Home Journal.

Connecticut Mythology.
Once upon a time— to be more pre
cise, In the latter part of the eighteenth
century— thre lived a worthy Connecti
cut divine named the Rev. Samuel
Peters. Peters was a picturesque per
sonage in his way, but his fame rests
entirely upon the fact that he wrote a
book. This is one of the most mar
velous works ever issued from the
oress.
It was Mr. Peters, for example, who
Srst discovered and made known to
the world that the founder of Yale
roliege was a Rev. Thomas Peters,
evidently one of his own ancestors;
that at Bellows Falls thp water flowed
30 fast that it became as hard as mar
ble, making It possible to float a crow
bar upon It; that two most marvelous
quadrupeds, the "whappermocker" and
Ibe "cuba" (evidently the ancestors of
Ibe jabberwock) roamed wild In the
Connecticut forest's, and It is also from
Mr. Peters that we first learn of the
famous Incursion of the Windham
frogs.
But it was in the early Jurisprudence
of Connecticut that this expatriate
made his most interesting discoveries.
He Informed his English readers— and
most of them believe the story de
voutly to this day— that the citizens
of the state were forbidden by law
to make mince pies, to play on any In
strument of music except the drum,
trumpet or Jewsbarp, and that every
male must have his hat cut round, "ac
cording to a cap," the model preferably
being the hard shell of a pumpkin.—

Folding; Beds.
AH purchasers of folding beds do not
buy them solely for tlie sake of saving
room. According to a manufacturer,
some people with ample bouse room at
command buy them, for one reason, so
that the roons in which they are placed
can be put t j oi: :-r uses than as bed
rooms.
This manufacturer mentioned one
New York family In whose house are
eleven fine folding beds. Any room In
the bouse designed for and equipped as
a sleeping room could easily be trans
formed from a bedroom to one that had
no appearance of a sleeping apartment
whatever.
There are produced nowadays folding
beds of one kind and another that are
sold at low prices, but the most costly
of the finer folding beds may easily be
pretty dear affairs.
The manufacturer told of one elab
orately designed and finished folding
bed that cost $1,000, the cost of the
carving alone having been ?300.— New
York Sun.
Oar Unit of Valve.
The real, actual nnit of value In the
United States Is the silver quarter.
The dime is out of place. In the bar
you get two drinks for a quarter; you
buy two cigars for a quarter. One ci
gar for 10 cents seems plebeian, so you
take two for a quarter. In the restau
rant you are ashamed to give the wait
er a 10 cent tip and cannot afford to
give him a quarter, but moral coward
ice drives you to let him have the
quarter. The quarter is the most beau
tiful silver coin in the world. It Is of
the njost convenient size. Mix up a
lot of dimes, nickels and copper cents
in your pocket and your sense of touch
balks at distinguishing between them.
Tou must haul out a handful of "chick
en feed" for visual identification. A
quarter you can tell from anything by
the "feel."— New York Tress.
Delaware.
Delaware has been called the Dia
mond State, for, though small in size,
it formerly was of great political im
portance. It also enjoys the nickname
of the Blue Hen State, this having been
bestowed on account "of a gentleman
named Caldwcll, who made the state
famous in sporting annals by the qual
ity of his gamecocks, which he always
bred from the eggs of a blue hen, be
lieving that this was the best color for
the mother of a gamecock.
The "Angry Tree."
The "angry tree," a woody plant
which grows from ten to twenty-flve
feet high, and which was formerly
supposed to exist only in one state
in the Union, Nevada, has been found
both in eastern California and in Ari
zona. If disturbed, this peculiar tree
shows every sign of vexation, even to
ruffling up its leaves like the hair on
an angry cat and giving forth an un
pleasant, sickening odor. *
Batters.
There are pour batters, drop batters
and doughs, all depending on the quan
tity of flour used with the liquid used.
Generally speaking, one full measure
of flour to a scant measure of liquid
makes a pour batter, two full measures
of flour a drop batter and three full
measures a dough. Something, of
course, depends on the liquid and the
quality of the flour.
Brass.
Brass Is an alloy of tin and copper,
and analysis of the earliest existing
specimens demonstrates that It was
formerly manufactured In the propor-
tions of one part of tin to nine of cop
per. A notice in Genesis fixes the dis
covery and use of both these metals,
according l to the Bible, at between
4,004 and 1,635 years before the Chris
tian era.

Chicago— Bustle and Slouch.
•In general, we live beneath a sky
within a sky, and our funereal pall,
while it occasionally lightens, seldom
lifts altogethet Whether the newcomei
approaches along the bluffs and ravines
of tlie north or through the swamps
and marshes of the south or over the
wide stretching prairies of the west
tup dun trappings of the great horror
show from afar. As he rattles along
through perky suburban settlements
or houest truck farms or half dried
swales and disheveled swamps tb€
horror grows.
Across the wide fields— gay with this
year's flowers or somber with last
year's weeds— separating the raw hud
dles of workers' cottages, tangles of
telegraph poles and of trolley wires,
lead on the eye toward ugly, shape
less hulks looming above the dingy
horizon— foundries, elevators, machine
shops, breweries, factories, icehouses
detached notes that preclude the great
discord to come. Then" avenues of
tracks, shut In by the shameless backs
of things and spanned by grimy via
ducts: arrays of, mean streets doggedly
curtained against the sun and resolute
ly fighting off the sweet country airs.
The heart sinks, the etomach re
volts as, through dirt, dust grime, soot
smoke and cinders the trembling neo
phyte bumps and jars along toward
the besmirched shrine of the two faced
goddess of Bustle and Slouch.— Henry

Absurd Fashions.
Some of the fashions in France dur
ing the reign of Queen Marie were ex
ceedingly absurd, particularly hair
dressing and hats, which were trim
med with such an extravagant wealth
of feathers that the coaches had to
have their seats lowered. According
to lime. Campan. "mothers and hus
bands murmured, and the generalru
mor was that the queen would ruin the
French ladies."
One day Louis XVI. decided to for
bid the court In a body "to follow the
royal hunt In coaches. In order to be
freer he wished only to permit real
sportsmen to attend. The noble la
dies immediately rebelled, and tha
Princess of Monaco criticised the deci
sion by means of her headdress, upon
which arose a miniature royal coach,
followed by two gentlemen on foot in
gaiters. On the left of this was dis
played a cypress garnished with black
tears, the large roots being formed of
crape.
More absurd still wa» the halrdress-
Ing of the mother of Louis Philippe,
upon whose head every one could ad
mire her son, the Due de Beaujolais,
in the arms of his nurse as well as a
parrot pecking at a cherry.
A Blatter of Opinion.
She had been having fun with Dude
kins-a long time, and he made up what
mind he had to get even. It took the
form of a brilliant and cogent conun
drum, whose answer Dudekins thought
was locked In his manly bosom.
"I have a conundrum for you, Miss
Fannie," he said, when he saw her
next.
"Ah," she replied, "what is It? Who
gave it to you? I .'
"I made it up myself," he asserted,
bridling somewhat:
"Indeed? What is It?"
"Why are my clothes like the moon 7'
She hesitated for a moment and
Dudekins began to look triumphant
"You may think," she said slowly,
and Dudekins somehow felt the sand
slipping from under him, "it is be
cause they have a man In them, and
you have a perfect right to think as
you please, but Mr. Dudekins, opinions
differ."— London Tit-Bits.
Zeno's Paradox.
Many persons will recall the famous
paradox of Zeno by which he sought
to prove that all motion Is Impossible.
"A body," he argued, "must more
either in a place where It Is or in a
place where It Is not Now, a body In
the place where It Is is stationary and
cannot be In motion, nor, 'obviously,
can it be In motion in the place where
it Is not Therefore It cannot move at
all." *
Bodies do move, however, and that
Is a sufficient answer to the ingenious
philosopher.
Had a Better Story.
"Did you see the account of -that
flash of lightning that burned the hair
from a boy's head without otherwise
hurting him?" -"
"I did," answered the cheerful liar,
"and I was pained to note the Incom
pleteness of the story. Now, I happen
to know of a case that Is really re
markable; The llgntnlng entered a bar
ber's shop and not only undertook the
task of singeing a man's hair, but it
rung up the proper amount on the cash
register."— Exchange.
Beads Turned Red by Eating;.
Mocking birds are great epicures In

they eat so freely the bright red prickly
pears that grow on a kind of cactus
that their bills, heads and throats be
come dyed as if with vermilion. ~

Urban Stupidity.
"Henry," said Uncle Amos from Up
creek, who was visiting his city neph
ew, "who's that man in the house on
the other side of the street? Every
morning he stands in front of a win
dow an* shaves himself. He's done
It now for three days hand running."
"I suppose that he has done it every
morning for the last ten years, ancle,"
replied Henry.
"Has he lived there all that time?"
"Yes, and longer than that, for all I
know. I've been here only ten years
myself."
"Who is he?'
"I don't know."
"What does he foller?"
"I haven't the slightest Idea, uncle."
Uncle Amos put on his hat and went
out - . ; .
In an hour or two he returned.
"Henry," he said, "that chap's name
Is Horton. He runs an insurance office
down town. He's wuth about $27,000,
owns that house an* lot, belongs to the
Presbyterian church, has three boys
an' one girl, an' he's forty-six years

He Watched Them.
The following is one of the stories
told about Eugene Field:'
There were visitors In prospect one
afternoon in the Field household and
a strike in the culinary department
Mischief was at flood tide, and Mrs.
Field was vainly endeavoring to be
everywhere at once, when the man of
"sharps and flats" appeared in the
kitchen doorway with a folio In his
hand.
"Oh, won't you watch those pies for
me while I run upstairs an Instant?"
his wife exclaimed. "Be sure not to
let the meringue scorch— lt would ruin
them; you'd better give me that book
or they'll be burned to a crisp." With
mock meekness Mr. Field allowed her
to carry off his treasure. On returning
she was horrified to find the oven door
wide open and the rich, fluffy meringue
flat, tough and leatherllke.
"They're rained !" she exclaimed in
dismay. "Why didn't yon keep the
oven door shut?"
"Keep the door shutl" . Mr. Field
repeated In very genuine amazement
"Why, you told me td watch them ev
ery instant and I'd like to know how
I could do that with the oven door
shut!"— New York Times.-
Sable Sheep.
Sable sheep are not frequently seen
in England, but ebony lambs are plen
tiful hi the Australian commonwealth.
A colonial fiockmaster had quite ' a
number of black lambs, and he folded
them iij a range by themselves. He
found that black lambs might not re
cur in a flock In generations and then
recur suddenly. For example, where a
black ram was used in a flock of white
ewes the product was white lambs,
with few exceptions, and where sire
end dam were ebony colored the lambs
were mostly white. And so the Aus
tralians gave up the attempt to found
a sable flock. Where wool is dyed a
deep color sable wool absorbs less dye
and makes a more durable color. Still
black fleece absorbs more sun rays; than
white, and Dlack sheep are more seri
ously-affected by heat— London Live
Stock Journal.
Speaker and Speakers.
There A a tale to the effect that while
Hon. Thomas Brackett Reed wielded
the gavel a gentleman took his little
boy to the gallery of the house of repre
sentatives. Looking down upon the
more numerous branch of the federal
legislature the child asked, "Father,
who is that large man sitting In the
pulpit with a mallet in his hand?" '
"He, my son," replied the fond par
ent, "is the house of representatives."
"And who are those other men sitting
in semicircles around him?" Inquired
the tiny chap.
"They are the speakers of the bouse
of representative^," answered pater
familias. — Champ Clark in Leslie's
Weekly.
Hlstorieal "Bulls."
Grave historical writers are occasion
ally guilty of what are called "Hlber
nicisms." The following passage oc
curs in a popular history of France:'.
"It is extremely doubtful whether
this prince, Merovseus, ever existed at
all, but he had a son, Childeric. whose
existence is well authenticated."
The following is also from a historic
al work:
"Like Samson of old, who,, armed
only with the Jawbone of an ass, put
1,100 Philistines to the sword."

Good Cough Sirup.
The following is said to make a
