Thousands of women who have suf-
fered from backache, headache, and
other consequences of womanly disease,
have been made . well women by the
use of Dr. Pjerce's Favorite Prescripr
tion. It establishes regularity, dries
unhealthy drains, heai-i inflammation
and ulceration and cures female
weakness. .
« I cannot say enough in praise of Dr. Pieree's
Favorite Prescription as it has done me so much
good," writes Mrs. Henry Harrell, of Tarboro,
K. C, Box 109. « I was swollen so I could hardly
walk when I began taking the ' Favorite Pre-
scription.' I also had uterine trouble and could
neither eat nor sleep only as I took morphine.
Tried four different doctors and they all failed
to do me any good, so one of my friends recom-
mended your ' Favorite Prescription ' to me and
I took only three bottles and am now well aod
hearty. Can do almost any kind of work."

Almond Culture in Amader County.
It has been demonstrated by S. C.
Wheeler of Plymouth that tlie almond
industry is a profitable business. Mr.
Wheeler's farm is located two miles
east of Plymouth, < at the foot of the
ridge before entering Shecandoah Val
ley. He has 220 bearing alnjond trees
of various varieties. They are ten
years old, and commenced to bear the
fourth year. Last season two tons of
nuts were harvested from this orchard,
and were readily sold at terj cents a
pound to a local market; thus realiz
ing $400 off of two and one half acres of
land. This crop was produced without
irrigation. The trees have never been
irrigated at any time since they were
planted. The trees never have re
ceived any extra care such as spraying,
etc. Pruning and plowing twice in a
season has been all the attention that
the orchard has received. It is well
known that almonds find a ready
market at. any time, 'and are easily
packed and shipped.
■The soil on which these trees are
grown is in common with the land in
that portion of the county, and thou ,
sand ot acres of such land could be put
to a profitable use. $160 an acre is
what this orchard is paying its owner
every year. What industry can make
a better showing than this? We' hope
the farmers of Amador will profit by
Mr. Wheeler's example and experience
by taking up this important industry,
and share in its revenue and the com
forts incidental to a well filled purse.

Eeport of the De) Monte Mines for
Hay and Jane, 1903.
JACKSON, Cal., June 3, 1903. } j
To the Subscribers and Stockholders:—
The Supt. reports for the two months
ending May 31st as follows:
Total cross-cut tunnel run in two
months, 67 feet.
Total cost, $977.64.
Cost per foot, $14.74.
Total working time, 42 days of two
shifts.
- Total length of iiiunel June Ist, 788 ft.
Upraise and drifts in old works/
$122.20.
Roads and ditches, $70.00.
Water for two months, $100.
Superintendence, general, $100.
Work on the cross-cut tunnel has
continued in extremely hard formation
for the last 75 feet, the rock proving so
refractory that with our Utmost efforts
we have at times almost despaired of
being able to penetrate it. Our New
Ingersoll drill, 'which represents* the
highest efficiency of piston drill, was
unable to meet the requirements in the
hard rock, so we made a test of the
new 5 Model Water Leyner drill. Upon
securing proper equipment for operat
ing this drill, we believe that we will be
enabled to secure greater efficiency and
at reduced expense.
The high footage cost shown by the
last two month's work is explained by
the increasing difficulty in dealing with
rock of extreme hardness, at a con
siderable distance under ground; the
greater distance required to tram the
waste causing an increase of fuotage
cost.
The superintendent reports that, the
last shifts, operating with the Leyner
drill, made encouraging progress,
owing to the higher efficiency of the
drills and the improving character of
the rock, which in the. last eight feet
has become lighter and more easily
worked.
The consensus of opinion among
miners here is that the hard reef of
quartzite just passed through is an en
couraging indication, and that good
values should exist back of such a
formation. The appearance of the
rock in the last eight feet shows the
laminations of such a trend as to indi
cate the approach to a ledge. The
same conclusions may be derived from
the increasing moisture at the face.
We regret to be obliged to report
the destruction of our blacksmith shop
and A considerable portion of its con
tents by fire, on the night of June 30th
about 12 o'clock, while the night shift
was on duty. The cause of the' fire is
unknown, but it was probably due to
the igniting of waste from a candle
snuff left by one of the men. The loss
will not exceed $500. .
The regular meeting of the stock
holders of the company will be held on
Monday, July 6, 1903, at 2 o'clock p.m.
Respectfully submitted,
Jas. Jay Wright,
%&}•■. Asst. Secy.

Men Repeat, but Do Not Copy.
Grant— lt is easier to say a good
thing than to do a good thing.
Henderson — Very true. But when
you say a good thing you are flattered

have few copyists when you do a good
deed.— Boston Transcript.

ACTION DEFERRED.
At the special session of the
board of supervisors held last Sat
urday the application of the Ameri
can Electric Company to erect pole
lines through Amador county was
: deferred until the July meeting. We
do not know what led to this post
- ponement. The company is prepar-
I ing to put up a line through this and
I adjoining counties for the purpose
Zof supplying light and power. It is
'in a measure a competing line.
| There is no fault to be found with
the Standard Electric Company.
That corporation has spent money
with a lavish hand in adding to the
1 taxable wealth of the county, and
• the utilization of its resources. It
; is deserving; of all praise for what it
has already accomplished, and for
I what it is still doing. It is by all
odds the heaviest taxpayer in the
county, and is therefore entitled to
, due consideration at the hands of
the authorities. The postponement
of action was probably to enable the
supervisors to investigate the mat
ter more thoroughly. If so, no' one
will question the wisdom of the move.
We cannot think for a moment that
the delay was prompted by any hos
tile feeling toward the new enter
prise. Every onward movement
awakens opposition from some
source. It is bound to be so, because
: every step in advance disturbs the
old order of things. It causes a re
arrangement of business to conform
with new conditions. It is only
natural that those whose interests
i are injuriously affected — temporarily
_ only it may" be— should not take
■ kindly to the innovation. We do
not believe that any governing body
will be swayed by such motives. The
world is moving. Old things are
passing away. We canont stay the
onward march of progress even if
we wanted to. We do not want to,
; however. Rather let us encourage
' every effort in this direction. Even
the Standard Electric Company at
the inception of its vast schemes in
this county, was looked upon with
misgivings. And yet no one need
to be told what an immense benefit
it has been to the development of
our industries. It is the province
of government to give all enter
prises a fair field and no favor.
Every enterprise adds to the tax
able wealth of the county, ; and
brings revenue to the public
treasury. From this standpoint
alone the American company should
be encouraged. -
AS USUAL.
Eeferring to the recent robbery of
Neil Hamm's place in this city the
, Ledger, with its usual degree of
fairness, says: "Sheriff Norman and
Deputy Jackson at once repaired to
the scene, and Young was soon
placed under arrest." Wouldn't
that jar?
The truth is that Constable Kelly
made the arrest, secured the con
fession and the coin before the sheriff
and his deputy arrived.
Isn't it in you to play fair? — Echo.
We beg to remind our cotem
porary that the Ledger reports an
item of news in strict accordance
with the information which it re
ceives. Perhaps the Echo man is
able to improve upon this policy.
We leave the public to judge as to
that. - Sometimes our information is
incomplete and inaccurate, but it
does not follow that the item is
written from ulterior motives. To
insinuate, as our Athenian friend
does in the above extract, that
facts were deliberately suppressed,
only serves' to exhibit the jaundiced
character of the critic. Fairness
is conspicuously absent apparently
i in his make-up.
THE SCHOOL POPULATION.
The returns from the school cen
sus marshals which we publish in
another column afford room for
grave concern. If they are to be
taken as presenting the juvenile
statistics in their true light, they
are positively alarming. The school
population is falling off year after
year, according to the official figures.
This falling off, however, was never
before brought out so alarmingly as
this year; We have been accus
tomed to fluctuations of population
within the county, incident in a
great measure to the changing for
tune of the mineral industry. But
from the standpoint of the county at
large we have usually managed to
average up fairly well in the number
of school children. This year the
statistics show a heavy falling off all
along the line. Not more than half
a dozen districts show an increase,
and in no case is the gain large. On
the other hand, the loss in some dis
tricts is very serious. One of the
most populous districts in the county
has been cut down one-seventh of its
school strength. Every township
shows a diminishing youthful popu
lition. For the whole county the
loss is about seven per cent. Such a
rate of decline continued for 14 years
would wipe out our local school sys
tem. This seems all the more sur
prising when we consider that the
year has been remarkable for the
number of borne-seekers flocking
into California. Instead of gaining
by the influx,' we have been unable to
hold our own. It is well to look the
situation squarely in the face. If
our school population is declining,
the conclusion is inevitable that our
adult population is decreasing in the
same ratio. Population represents
wealth. If -we are losing population,
the inference is that our taxable
property is suffering ivi v value also.
In this connection we must mention
one fact that may to some extent
tone down the reported decrease of
children. la accordance with a
change made in the law relating to
the school census, the marshals were
required this year to furnish a list
showing the name of.-, every census
child. This was not required ."under
the old law; simply the number of
children in each household was re
ported, without giving the names.
[t was much easier to fall into error
in reporting a larger number of
childreD than were actually in the
district under the old than the
present law. Indeed, where the
names have to be given, it is a hard
m»tter to stuff the roll to any ex
tent. In the opinion of school super
intendent Gordon this change in the
law accounts largely for the decrease
reported. Be believes the decrease
is more apparent than real;' that
there are as many school children in
the county to-day as there have
been in any previous year. ;" -"
Do Ton Enjoy What Yon Eat?
If you don't your food does not do
you much good. Kodol Dyspepsia
Cure -is the remedy that every one
should take when there is anything
wrong with the stomach. There is no
way to maintain the health and strength
of mind and body except by nourish
ment. There is no way to nourish ex
cept through the stomach. The
stomach must be kept healthy, pure
and sweet or the strength will let down
and disease will set in. No appetite,
loss of strength, nervousness, head
ache, constipation, bad breath, sour
risings, rifting, indigestion, dyspepsia,
and all stomach troubles arc quickly
cured by the use of Kodol Dyspopsia
Cure. Sold by City Pharmacy, Jack

Deafness Cannot be Cured
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear
There is only one way to cure deafness,
and that is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous lining.of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
flamed you have a rumbling 'sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can be
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars
for any case of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free

A new pipe has been placed this week
.0 supply the hospital with water, or
•athor the old pipe formerly used to
iprinkle the lone road has been taken
ip to the extent necessary to furnish
.he new line. The old pipe had been
vorn to such an extent that it was
tractically worthless. No water could
>c got through it at times, it had be
some so choked with rust. The new
tipe is i\ inches; the pipe line aband
med is 2 inches in diameter. The ser
vice is much more satisfactory, as the
lew line will be kept exclusively for the
lse of the hospital.
The lone road is being treated to a
iberal coating of. oil. The treatment
s confined to that portion of the road
vay from lone to within a mile
)f Mountain Springs— five miles in all.
The oil is being spread cold. A dis
;ussion is now on as to the relative ad
vantages of cold and heated oil for road
naking purposes. By means of brush
.he Loose soil is stirred immediately
if tor the oil is sprinkled, so as to insure
i. good mixture of tho oil with the
jarth. The traction engine is expect
)d to make its appearance over the
•oad in a few days.
Tha Ledger hereby announces that
»utside of the simple announcement of
sburch services on the Sabbath, no
rce advertising- will hereafter be ad
nitted to these columns. The distinc
ion between a legitimate news item
mil an advertisement is clearly marked.
\Dy social event in the future, whether
or the benefit of the church or aqy
senovolent or other cause, and for
which an admission fee is charged, is
m advertisement, and cannot be an
lounced gratis. It has come to pass
that any social function that comes
aJong, no matter if the raising of funds
>y an admission price is the main object,
s looked upon as entitled tp free notice
n the local papers. In many instances
this free laudation is depended upon ex.
slusively to make the affair known. In
future we shall cut out all such notices,
unless the intention is clearly expressed
to pay for the same at regular rates, or
unless some business in the shape of
job printing or other patronage is re
ceived in connection therewith. The
Ledger has been played— we might say
preyed— upon to the limit in this re
gard. Hereafter the line will be strict
ly adhered to, regardless of the course
pursued by our cotemporarfea.
Frank Hoffman's Estate.
The safe of the late Frank Hoffman
was opened last Friday, in the presence
of the heirs principally interested, and
attorneys and several citizens who had
been invited to be present. ,The value
of the personal property proved some
what of a disappointment. There
was $4360 in gold coin. Most of this
coin was rusted, indicating that It had
been burled for a considerable time,
and had but recently been rescued from
its depositary and placed in the safe.
There was also over $5000 in interest
bearing bonds, and certificates of stock
in the Argonaut and Bunker Hill mines.
The total value of the personal prop
erty will foot up to about $22,000. The
real estate consisting of several lots and
dwelling houses, was disposed of by tes
tamentary deeds, and the deeds placed
on record last week. Miss Christina
Rickert was deeded the old homestead;
E. Fisher received the house and lot in
which he was living, and to A. Rickert
was deeded the corner dwelling at the
junction of the Sutter and Stony creek
road, which he and his wife have oc
cupied for some time. The estate is
disposed of by will, and the will has
been filed for probate. An old will
made thirty years ago was discovered,
with the signature torn off, to indicate
its annulment. The latest will it is
said, was made only a few weeks ago—
since the death of Mrs. Hoffman.
A peculiar feature of this affair is
that the deceased's body was the first
to find a resting-place in the costly
vault which he had ordered as the final
repositary of the remains of himself
and wife. A few weeks back he made
a contrast with A. Frauatovicb, the
local sculptor, for a vault and monu
ment to cost $1700. At the time of the
suicide the vault had been excavated,
and the floor and walls finished, and
temporary covering provided. After
the funeral services, the casket contain
ing tbe remains of Frank Hoffman was
deposited in this vault. The same
evening tbe grave of Mrs. Hoffman
was opened, and the casket containing
htir remains was removed therefrom,
and reve?ent)y laid by the side of that
of her life companion.
Board of Supervisors.
A special meeting of the board of
supervisors was held Saturday, June
6, present all the members.
The matter of the application of ths
American River Electric Company for
a franchise was brought up for con
siaetitkjg. Proof of publication of
notice for bids ;n tho Stockton Mail
was read. Bid of electric company was
read, offering $100 and 75 free lights
for county buildings.
A motion was thereupon made that
further consideration be continued
until next regular meeting in July.
The motion was carried. A motion
was subsequently made to reconsider
said action, and the motion was lost.
In the matter of the raising of the
shed across the public road at Miller's
station near lone. J. Miller appeared,
and made a statement es^ng forth the
condition of said shed, whereupon phe
matter was dismissed. »
Adjourned until first Monday in July.
Skipped Off Without Permission.
W. D. Ould, deputy constable during
the temporary absence ot A. Laverone.
who is off on a fishing expedition to
Silver lake, went to Yuba county last
week for the purpose of bringing back
Frank O'Connoll, who was wanted on
a charge of beating a board bill. It
seems that O'Connsll ha<} been arrested
by a constable in Yuba county £t a
point some VI miles from Marysville.
Tiiwt jvas no calaboose in the place,
and the local officer had to guard him
the best way he could uatil the arrival
of the constable from this county tp re-
Hove him of bis charge. A/te.r reach
ing Marysville, Ould proceeded to his
destination. On his arrival he found
that he was too late. The prisoner
had taken advantage of the parole
privileges allowed him by the officer,
and departed for parts unknown. Ould
returned Saturday alone, and related
tho story of the discomfiture of his
initial effort in the man-hunting line.

nected with t/he American Federation

Stage Horse Drops Dead.
Last- Saturday one of the horses
which was being driven to the baggage
wagon running between lone and Jack
son, dropped dead on the road between
Martell's and the Kennedy mine. It is
supposed that the horse was overcome
by the intense heat that prpvailed at
the time, although the animal showed
no signs of being sfpk. He fell dead
without the least warning. Dave
Phillips telephoned to Jackson, and
another horse with which to. complete
the trip was sent out 49 soop as the
news was received.

GOVER MINE ACCIDENT
Superintendent Purington Killed by
Bursting of Air Compressor.
A terrible accident occurred at the
Fremont Consolidated mine early Sat
urday morning, resulting in the instant
death of C. E. Purington, the superin
tendent, who has been in charge of the
works ever since the present company
was organized, and the injuring of
Wales Palmer, the foreman. The acci
dent occurred at the air compressor,
close to the Gover shaft. The air com
pressor was used to operate the power
drills underground. It was run by
electric power. It is a massive piecoof
machinery. Ever since it was installed
it has been a source of more or less
trouble from the heating of the boxes
or bearings.
On Saturday morning engineer Rule
noticed that the air compressor was
not working satisfactory. He sent a
boy to notify Mr. Purii.gton of the fact.
The superintendent, who was a practi
cal machinist, was on the scene In a few
minutes thereafter. He started in to
try and fix the machine. He had not
been there more than five minutes
when tho explosion occurred.
At the time of the explosion both
Purington and Palmer were close to
the machinery. Palmer was engaged
In working at the machine, j but- some
what out of line of the force of the ex
plosion. Purington was standing in
front, adjusting the machine. Sudden
ly the compressor burst, the cylinder
being blown into fragments. One piece
caught Purington squarely in the
bpdy, and drpve him cfear tjirpugh the
side of the galvanized iron ' building.
The force was such as to almost cut
him in twp. Of course, he was killed
instantly. He probably had no time
to realise' what had happened..
' The concussion was so great as to
throw Wales Palmer against the build
ing with" sufficient force to fracture two
ribs and disable one arm. HU was
almost a miraculous escape from death.
The news of this terrible disaster was
at once telephoned over the county,
and produced a profound impression of
sp>rpw. deceased #as 54 ye^rs pf age.,
and leaves 'a wife and se£ era! childi'en:
The body was taken to Auburn for
burial on Monday.
For about 10 years the victim, had
devoted his time and means toward
bringing tho Gover and Fremont mines
to their present condition. In face of
discouragements that would have dis
mayed the ordinary man, ' he worked
on. He had the utmost confidence in
the mineral resources of this particular
section of the mother lode, and was
suthciently influential with capitalists
to induce them to invest in these claims.
With the mill in process of erection
it was believed that he was on the
verge of the realization of his fondest
hopes in bringing" the prop?rty to a
paying basla. Everything he had, he
had invested in the stock of the corpora
tion, thereby evincing his good faith.
In the scheme which he prevailed upon
others to invest in, he staked his all
himself. He died at his post, when the
attainment of bis ambition was appar
ently in sight. '" ' '
The air compressor that caused this
lamentable fatality, had ' given con
siderable trouble ever since it was
started up about a year ago. The de
ceased was himself a practical electric
ian and machinist. i?he machine itself
and its setting.iip was in a great meas
ure under his direction. But it did
not work smoothly. The boxes were
continually heating, causing appre
hension on the part of those employed
about the works. Some time ago
mechanics from San Francisco were
employed to practically rebuild it. Still
it kept up its record for kicking; ' J.
Eudey was employed for a while there,
and quit on account of the premonitions
of disaster which the machinery gave
tortk,
THE CAUSE OF THE DISASTER.
The precise cause of the explosion is
not very clear. The air compressor
was of the Ingersoll-Sergeant type. It
was put up under the direction of Pur
ington himself. The escape valve for
increasing or diminishing the pressure
was placed $ few inches abpve' the air
chamber, within easy reach pf the at
tendant. This arrangement was a de
parture from the ordinary and stand
ard method. Whether it had anything
to do with the fatal denouement we are
not prepared tg say. James Rule, the
engineer, noticed a slight leakage
—a dripping— around one or two of the
bolts in the front part of the' com
pressor. It was doing its work all
right. Puringtpn's son, a ypung man
of about 19, was attending the com
pressor. The signs of distress were
sufficient to cause the engineer to send
a boy of Wales Palmer, who happened
to be near, to tell Purington. In a few
minutes bpth Superintendent Puring
tpn and Fpreman Palmer appeared to
gether. 'Tho former seeing the trouble
remarked, "We'll fix that." Rule
withdrew to the engine room, leaving
the two officials there. Purington
reached for the valve over the cylin
der. Whether he shut off the escape,
thereby increasing the pressure, is not
positively known. Immediately the
front and top part of the air" cylinder
blew out; It was made of heavy cast
Iron, fully an inch thick. The impres
sion is that the manipulation pf the
valve increased the pressure, and the
explosipn resulted. Fragments of iron
were hurled into the engine room. The
concussion from the sudden release of
pent-up air wrecked the 'side of the
building, breaking the studding, as
well as blowing off the iron sheets fas
tened thereto.
A machinist frpm San Franciscp is
up to repair the machine. Mr. Good
all, of the firm of Goodall, Perkins &
Co., is on the ground, and will remain
in pharge fpr a time.

Proposed High School District.
lone is first in the field tp organize
fo.r a uniph high sphppl dtgtript fpr the
purpose of recelying'tp.e 'pepe'fit of the
law passed by the last legislature
authorizing a tax of j£ cents on all
taxable property in tbe'state for the
support of high schools. An election
has been called in the school districts
in township two to vote on the proposi
tion. The election will be held on Sat
urday, June 13. ' The districts to be in
cluded in the proposed high school dis T
trlqt are as fpllqws: CamV Qpra, Car
bondale,' lone', Mountain Springs,
Mt. Pleasant, Mt. Echo, and Lancha
Plana. This arrangement omits Buena
Vista, Jackson Valley and Julian school
districts, from the scope of the high
school. Outside of lone, the districts,
left put are tte jnosji" populous, fr&m
a juvenile point of view, in the town
ship, having 98 census children while
the seven districts included in the elec
tion call outside of lone, have a school
population of 128. It may appear
strange that the largest districts out
side of lone should keep alqpf from the.
movement," especially when ' ]t ' is con
sidered that the territdry 'covered by
these districts is within easy reach of
the probable location of the school.
We assume that in the three districts
excluded, a majority pf tho heads of
families declined tp jqin in the petition
to submit the question to a vote. That
is the preliminary step in the formation
of a high school district. A majority
of the heads of families — not a majority
of the qualified voters — in each school
district must sign a petition to, submit
fhe question tp a vpte. This is riot
pnly the initial step, but the most vital
step in the whole proceeding. Con
sent to submit the high school question
to a vote, carries with it the consent of
each district to be governed b.y the
majority ygte pf entire high, sphopl
fJistricf as pr£pp.sed. ' After agreeing
to call an electipn, the several c|Utr|cts
lose their individuality in the matter,
Thejr become merged in f.l» e proposed
district as a whple. Jn th,e coming
electipn a majority vpte pf the qualified
electors is decisive of the question. It
matters not whether Lancha Plana or
any other small district votes over
whelmingly against the proDositjon. if
the vote on tlje whflle is T favorable,
Lanqha Plana its swept in with the rest.
It is presumed of course, that in voting
to call an election those signing the
petition will also vote to establish the
high school. Nevertheless, it is proper
to explain the matter as far as possible.
There is a possibility that the subject
may be misunderstood. Wp have not
noticed any discussion' of this partipular
point. Itisnb mpre than r|ght that
those interested §hpuld' ; ho fully in
formed on a matter of such importance
as the subjection pf their property to a
special tax for an indefinite, period.'
We do npt argue the justice or injus
tice of the law. In this particular case
the preponderance of votes Is with lone
City. Should lone vote solidly for,
and the outside districts, vfita aqlidly
against >he pcopp|it(pn, 'still the
high school district . would' carry, not
pnly for lone but for all the other dis
tricts named. True, tljat is an extreme
view. The prpbability is that a Majori
ty of the heads of families In all 'the
districts having joined in the petition,.
a majprity of voters In each district
will be found ranging themselves under
the banner of "for the high achqq}."
Such, hqwever, {a tyvv., ' and It is.
right that those concerned stiquld lose
made it.
Shocked by Electricity.
Md Sanman, pne o.f the linemen em
ployed by the Sunset Telephone Com?
pany in reconstructing the network of
wires in Jackson, had a narrow escape
from serious Injury last Mflnd'ay. He
Ws9 standing 'qn the ro.of of Lane
hp.rst a pp.rch;eng'^ged in hauling a loose
wire over the electric light wire. The
loose wire must have com*) in contact
with a bare spo* in the power line— a
spot where the insulation was worn off.
All at once Sanman was knocked dowq
by a charge. He fell backward on the
roof. The wire he was puljiqg at was
melted with the fierce heat, the ends
falling to, thp ground. The fuse of the
incandescent lamp in the show window
of Langhorst's store was burned out.
Fortunately everything was dry.
Sanman s unpleasant experience only
lasted for a few minutes. He was able
to go right on with his work 50.00 after
the shock. IJad h,a been o,p the ground,
With, tha street (rash, sprinkled, the
stipple wpuld have been much more
serious, and probably necessitated a
lay-off for several days,
Tho Garabaldi boy, who is under
treatment at the Children's home in
San Prancisoo for a gunshot wound in
the hip, Is improving steadily. The
outlook is favorable Tor his complete
recovery. Another operation will have
to be undergone to ascertain %h* exact
condition of the bone at the point
affected. The medical men of the city
are. not unanimous on this point.

Animals Are Sensitive.
. "The fact that a horse Is sensitive to
ridicule," said a student of the biolog
ical department of the University of
Pennsylvania, "may easily be demon
strated. Take, for instance, the case of
a horse that is eating out of a nosebag.
If you stand In front. of such a horse,
attract his attention, and then, with
loud , laughter, mock his way of feed
ing, -he will stop, with a look of em
barrassment and shame, and he will
not resume his meal until y6u are gone
away.
"Dogs also object to being laughed
at. Make fun of them and they will
cease whatever they are doing. It is
only when they are in a fight that they
will remain impervious to the shafts
of mockery."— Philadelphia Post.
The Hnman Body.
' A pupil in a village school who bad
been requested to write an essay on
the human body handed in the follow
ing: "The human body consists of the
head, thorax, abdomen and legs. The
head contains the brains, in case there
are any. The ' thorax contains the
heart and lungs; also the liver and
lights. The abdomen* contains the
bowels, of which there are five— a, c, 1,
o, v and sometimes w and y. The
legs extend from the abdomen to the
floor and have hinges at the top and
middle to enable a fellow to sit when
standing or to stand when sitting."
'Worth More.
Customer (in art gallery)— Ten dol
lars is a high price for that picture.
It's nothing but a man smoking a
pipe.
Dealer— Yes, but look at that pipe,
my dear sir. It's genuine meerschaum,
beautifully colored and extra large
size. You couldn't buy that pipe alone
for less than $15.— Chicago Tribune.
How Handle Gets Experienced.
Irene— ls Maud really going to marry
that sappy youth?
\ Enid— Mercy, no! She is only en
gaged to him. You see, poor, dear
Maud has never been engaged before,
and she thinks she ought to practice a
little before entering Into it seriously.

" BRUTTSfCCTL'T TRAiNTNG.
How Farmer Perldns Used Strategy
and a Ball Whip.
There Is a right way and a wrong
way of breaking * colt to halter. The
latter method is described by SewelJ
Ford in "Horses Nine." Blue Blazes,
the colt In the story, was owned by a
Michigan farmer. He had been fright
ened by the first attempt to bridle him
and had broken away. He was prompt
ly declared to be a vicious colt
"We'll tame hlmr' said Farmer Per
kins. Under his coat he bid a stout
halter and a heavy bull whip. Then,
holding a grain measure temptingly be
fore him, he climbed the pasture fence.
■ In the measure were oats, which he
rattled seductively. Also he called
mildly. and persuasively. Blue Blazes
was suspicious. Four times he allowed
the farmer to come almost within
reaching distance, only to turn and bolt
with a snort of alarm just at the cru
cial moment At last he concluded that
he must have just one taste of those
oats. v
"Come, coltle! Nice coltie!" cooe<J
the man in a strained but conciliating
voice.
Blue Blazes planted himself for a
sudden whirl, stretched bis neck as far
as possible and worked his upper lip
Inquiringly. The smell of the oats
lured him on. Hardly had he touched
his nose to the grain before the meas
ure was dropped, and he found himself
roughly grabbed by the forelock. In a
moment he saw the hated straps and
ropes. Before he 'could break away
the halter was around his neck and
buckled firmly. , : I. -T;
Farmer Perkins changed his tone.
"Now, you ugly little brute, I've got
you! [Jerk.] Blast your wicked bide!
[Slash.] You will, will you? [Yank.]
I'll l'arn you!" [Slash.]
Man and colt were almost exhausted
when the "lesson" was finished. It
left Blue Blazes ridged with welts,
trembling," fright sickened. Never
again would he trust himself within
reach of those men; no, not if they of
fered him a whole bushel of oats.
WOMEN'S HATS.
Men, Sara a , Milliner, Are Ke«a
Judges of Becoming Effects.
"Don't think for a minute that men
know nothing about women's hats,"
said a milliner. "I don't refer, to men
who can describe feminine friljs with
the fluency of a floorwalker. I mean
the average specimen, who doesn't
know the difference between a toque
and a Gainsborough. They are keen
Judges of effects— better than their
wives. Men often come In fiere with
their wives.' The woman begins to try
on all the hats In the shop. The man
grows nervous. While madam 'will
pirouette before the mirror and view
the creation from every side before
passing Judgment the man gives his
opinion without a bit of hesitation.
" 'Take It off!' he will say." 'You look
like a Sioux brave with his war bon
net on!'
"He doesn't know why he disap
proves. He couldn't describe the trim
ming if he tried, but he does know that
It doesn't suit his wife. Without wait
ing a second he gives his decision;' and
his wife fe almost in tears as she sees
him turn down some of the prettiest
models. But he doesn't care how they
look in the window or on the. head of
Mrs. Jones or Mrs. Brown. He wants
something that is becoming to his wife.
"At last she tries on the hat he
wants. He knows It even before she
has had a chance to glance at herself
in the mirror. And I would say that
his Judgment usually coincides with
ours."— New York Press.
Driving: ' Twelve Horses.
Here Is an arithmetical problem for
you: If it is great fun to drive one
horse, how much fun is it to drive
twelve horses? It is quite a -natural
answer to say twelve times as much
fun, but if you were to ask me I should
say divide ane by twelve, and you will
have a more correct answer. Think of
It— twelve horses to manage at once!
That is a sight I saw a few days ago,
however, in the crowded streets of
New York. The driver showed such
superb horsemanship that people In
the streets stopped to admire his dex
terity. The horses were drawing im
mense steel girders to be, used in erect-
Ing a skyscraper. Two men went ahead
of this cavalcade to warn the cars to
stop at convenient places for passing
and to clear the street generally. Es
pecially where a corner was . turned
was there much admiration expressed
for the driver's skill. There he sat, as
calm and cool as if driving an old nag
down a country lane instead of twelve
sturdy horses down New York's busi
est thoroughfare, Broadway. — New
York Letter in Pittsburg Dispatch.
It Did Him Good.
'"I am sorry, doctor, you were not
able to attend the snpper last night It
would have done you good to be there."
"It has already done me good, mad
am. I have just prescribed for three of
the participants."
