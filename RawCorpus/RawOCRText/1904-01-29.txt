The Amador Ledger.
Why an Alias T
One afternoon, when the Duke of
Edinburgh and Sir Arthur. Sullivau.
having finished a duet, were sitting
down to a homely "dish of tea" pro
vided by Mrs. Sullivan, the composer's
mother, it suddenly occurred to her to
start the subject of family names and
titles, which puzzled the good lady con
siderably.
"Sir,", she said, "your family. name Is
Guelph."
"My dear mother," began Arthur.
"But it is, isn't it?" she persisted.
"Certainly,"- replied -the duke, much
amused. "What's the matter with It
Mrs. Sullivan?" ~
"Oh, nothing," returned the excellent
old lady musingly. "Only I can't un
derstand why you don't call yourself
by your proper name." ■ :. . ; .
Arthur wanted' to explain to her, but
the duke would not allow him to.
"There's nothing to be ashamed of in
the name of Guelph, Mrs. Sullivan." he
said gravely.
'.'That's exactly what I say," persist
ed \ Arthur's mother; | "nothing /what
ever as far as I know, and, that being
so, why you should not call yqurself by
It I can't understand."— F. C. Bur
nand's "Records and Reminiscences."
At the Opera.
"Why do you insist on sitting near
the bass drum and cymbals at a grand
apera performance?"
"I don't mind telling you as an oKI
friend," answered Mr. Cumrox. "It's
the only way I can make sure of uot
disgracing mother and the girls by
staying asleep through the entire per
formance."—Washington Star.
Freedom.
We talk largely of freedom, and yet
the widest freedom we may enjoy in
this world Is not a whit greater pro
portionately than , that enjoyed by a

The Kiss.
An American humorist once said that
"the only way to define a kiss Is to take
one." Oliver Wendell Holmes called a
kiss the twenty-seventh letter of the
alphabet— "the love labial which It
takes two to speak plainly."
■It cannot be too often repeated, . "To
tinovate is not to reform."— Burke.
WEEDS
Consumption is a human
weed flourishing best in weak
lungs. Like other weeds it's
easily destroyed while young;
when old, sometimes im-
Strengthen the lungs as you

The best lung fertilizer is

The time to treat consump-
tion is when you begin trying
to hide it from yourself.
Others see it, you won't.
Don't wait until you can't
deceive yourself any longer.
Begin with the first thought
to take Scott's Emulsion. If
it isn't really consumption so
much the better; you will soon
forget it and be better for the
treatment. If it is consump-
tion you can't expect to be
cured at once, but if you will
begin in time and will be
rigidly regular in your treat-
ment you will win.
Scott's Emulsion, fresh air,
rest all you can, eat all you

that's the best treatment.

"Fifteen dollars."
"I'll take that Instead of this one, if
you don't mind." '
"Certainly."
A day or two later he came again.
"How good a watch have you got
for $25?" he inquired. .V c -. . .' : • .
."Well, |25 will get a pretty good
timepiece," said the jeweler, handing
one out. "Here's one with a gold filled
case and full jeweled. The movement
is warranted."

He paid . the difference, took the
Watch and went away.
After the lapse of a few days he

"Have you got a first class watch

That" a the one I really wanted at first
but I hated to pay out all that money
at once." ■
A Roman Meet.
Rome has a delightful climate tbe
whole year round, and from the end
of November to the middle of March
is an ideal time for hunting. Then the
hounds meet twice a week. On such
mornings the riders leave Rome or the
villas roundabout in time to be on the
field and ready by 11 o'clock, for the
hunt' Is always several miles from
Rome, sometimes on the rolling, partly
timbered land to the northward, but
more often on the level, plain. Such a
meet is to Rome what a Aleadowbrook
meet Is to New York. It means a
morning gathering of fashionables,
with time and money and distinction
to its credit. Swift moving, motor cars,
lumbering ; drags and ; four-in-hands,
smart phaetons, barouches, victorias
and dogcarts hurry out from the city.
From the estates of nobleineu ' In the
vicinity of the hunt come more car
riages, and men on the huutcrs which
they will ride in the day's chase.— P.

The nrnth Substitute.
"I had in my employ," says one of
the missionaries to China, "a very valu
able-Chinese servant, upon whom I
leaned with implicit confidence. One
day he came to me and said, '1 shall be
obliged to ask you to find somebody to
take my place, as in the course of a
few weeks I am to be executed In place
of a rich gentleman, who is to pay me.
very liberally for becoming his substi
tute.'
1 '"I asked what possible inducement
there could be to forfeit his life for any
amount of money.' He replied: 'I have
an aged father and mother, who are
very poor and unable to work," and the
money I am to receive will make them
comfortable as long as they live. 1
think it is my duty to give up my life
to accomplish this.' "
Expert Sandwich Cutters.
"Men who cut sandwiches must have
just as much knack and experience hi
the business as men who open oysters
on the river boats." said a New York
man who on one occasion supplied 75,
000 sandwiches at two days' notice.
"It took seven men to do that job in
the time allowed," he said, "and they
hadn't any time to spare at tliat. I
paid them by the hundred, the man
who did the most work getting the
most pay. When they were all through,
there weren't enough scraps of bread
and meat to fill a tin pail. That is the
secret of cutting sandwiches— to avoid
waste."
The Spit Snake.
There Is a snake belonging to the
small family causidse, inhabiting Afri
ca, that is said to have the power of
ejecting its venom to a short distance.
This snake is called by the Dutch
Boers "spuw slang," or spit, snake.
When this snake erects its teeth the
pressure of the maxillary bone on the
gland causes the venom to flow in
drops, and it may be quite possible that
by discharging air from its mouth the
poison may be blown some distance. •
Stagnation Is Death.
The sun would be consumed by its
own ardor if it did not shine. Nature
knows nothing of hoarding. The sun
gives away Its gold without ostenta
tion. The ocean gives its vapors to the
clouds, the clouds return them to the
earth, the rivers to the sea. There Is c
constant exchange between lungs and
leaves. Stagnation is death. Give to

A TIRELESS WORKER.
The Marvelous Energy That Was »
Part of Mnranlny.
No life was ever lived at higher pres
sure than 1 that of Macaulay. He was
not only "like a book in breeches," |as
Sydney Smith said of him; he was also
like an intellectual' steam engine.' f. His
thirst for knowledge was only ; equaled
by his amazing capacity for retaining
knowledge and by his passionate inter
est in all the aspects of- life. "I wish
I knew; as much of anything, as Ma
caulay knows of evrryiliing," said Mel
bourne, and, though the epigram may
have been intended as - a gibe. It ap
proximated to the truth. To the aver
age dullard of the world it must have
seemed that this tempestuous man was
literally omniscient" He plunged into
Italian like a boy rejoicing in a new
toy; he took up Spanish with an appe
tite growing by what it fed on, and
then he returned to Greek with a Joy
which he found indescribable. . ifc
amused himself in going to India . by
learning German and mitigated the dis
tress of a. voyage across to Ireland by
committing "Paradise Lost" to mem
ory, claiming, doubtless with truth,
that if by any inconceivable mischance
the great epic were to be utterly de
stroyed he could from the tablets of his
memory give it back .to the i world.—
London News.
A Highland Dinner.
"The highland dinner is a very smart
affair, and one that is never seen south
of the Tweed," says the London Queen.
"The laird wears his full dress kilt ev
ery night, and every one with any
claim to a clan does the same, so that
often there are more kilted men around
the table than black coats.
"The full kilt dress is splendid, and
a man to the manner born looks far
better in It than in any other clothes.
It gives width, height and dignity to
the wearer, with its shayd/ sporran and
brooches. Not only does the laird wear
his highland dress, but toward the end
of dinner his piper, who has played in
the hall outside during the meal, comes
into the room and marches around the
table. The pipes are a little deafening,
but the player looks so fine that one is
glad to see him. Most of the pipers In
the more noble families have inherited
the position from their ancestors '■ and
are rightly proud of the post. After
dinner, if there is a big house party,
there is often a dance. Then the piper
Is at his best, as he plays his pipes for
the lightsome reels to be danced, beat-
Ing time with his foot the while."
The Value of Politenesi.
If those who. are doubtful as to the
correct course to pursue in any given
situation will remember that even tbe
wrong tiling is overlooked If one is but
absolutely polite in the doing of it. their
relief might be great i
A gentleness of demeanor and a cour-'
teous response or question enn never be
out of place. A man may wear a busi
ness suit of clothes to an evening wed
"ding" less noticeably than a truculent'
air of insolence. If he be perfectly well
bred as far as behavior goes, it matters
not so much what his outward garb,
although by an uuwrltton law of social
observance certain clothes are the cor
rect thing for certain occasions.
•Politeness is never wrong. Its prac
tice goes nearly all the way toward the
goal of the right thing in the right
place. We hear of polite insolence, but
insolence is never polite, and it is never
under any circumstances polite to be
Insolent" •" ■
Clock Plant.
The clock plant is a native of Borneo,
and in that country even it is said to
be rare. The plant derives its name
from its peculiar habits, which are
known to but few who have not studied
It from a scientific standpoint. The
plant has leaves of two sizes, one
of which acts in the capacity • of a
minute hand, which keeps moving un
til 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and the
other keeps going until morning. The
larger leaves act as the hour hands!
Starting in a position when alltlio
leaves lie close to the stem, with the
points banging down, they rise gradu
ally until they turn .toward the top,
and then they drop to their former po
sition. It takes the smaller leaves
about one minute to go through this
performance and the longer leaves just
about an hour.— Melbourne Times.
A Bornean Weapon.
The Bornean mandau, or "head tak
er," Is a modification of the Burmese
dah. It is a heavy, thick bladed cat
lass, from twenty to thirty inches loug,
and the edge is ground from the right
side only, the left side being forged
slightly concave.^^ — The blade is also
slightly curved to the right, so that the
cutting action of the weapon is like
that of an enormous gouge. Only two
strokes can be dealt with the mandau —
from right to left downward and left to
right upward.— Chambers' Journal.
Indication of Interest.
"Teacher Is interested in you, pa."
"How so?' 1 *
"Why, today, after she told me seven
times to sit down and behave myself,
she said she wondered what sort of a
father I had."— Cleveland Plain Dealer.

A friend whom you have been gain-
Ing during your whole life you ought
not to be displeased with in a moment.

ruby. Take care that you do not de
stroy it In an instant against another

A PLAGIARIST.
The Sort of a Thief That Charles
Reade j Pronounced Himself.
, The novelists who aspire toward ab
solute originality of plot might think
once In awhile of , the sources from
which certain masters drew their In
spiration and of the calmness with
which those great workers picked up
whatever would serve them at their
trade. ': Charles Reade depended on the
newspapers as the living record of life
as it Is. One day in the week he de
voted to his scrapbooks. Passing events
seemed to him of vital Importance, and
the result of his collating appeared in
novels whose "purpose" told. "''
;/- In "Never" Too Late to Mend" he ex
posed the cruelties^ practiced in the
prisons before the reform was success
ful; in "Hard Cash" he attacked the
abuses of private lunatic asylums; to
"Put Yourself In His Place" he opened
on trade unions. "He was a modern cru
sader. One. day. be. found In a newßpa

of work. His rage was instant and vio
lent
"Plagiarist!" he roared, crushing the
paper. "Of course I am a plagiarist

except those idiots who are too asinine
to profit by the works of their supe

The thief of all thieves was the War

Fiscalitla Is Old.
Fiscalltls is a disease that flourished
hi England as far back as the four
teenth century, only the tax that was
then Imposed upon foreign goods was a
broken head to the maker of them. . .
When Wat Tyler's people entered
Southwark In 1371 their anger was so
great against the Flemish weavers and
other workers that they made the pro
nunciation of "bread and cheese" a test
of the honest home worker, and who
ever failed to pass it was deemed a
Fleming and put to death. A century
later Cade's Kentlshmen had for one of
their cries, "The foreigners forestall
the market, and so Englishmen want
and starve I" •
About 1585 England was called the
Asylum Christi, so many were the for
eign weavers, brewers, silk workers
and jewelers who settled there, and a
popular saying In Henry VIII.'s reign,
"The French teach us how to make
hats and how to take them off," shows
the importance of foreign made goods
at that time.— London Standard. ,
The Old Time Pepper Mill.
' A pepper mill is a piece of silver not
often seen on tables nowadays. Eng
lish housekeepers, however, still use
the pepper mill, and American silver
smiths sometimes keep it to meet the
demands of old fashioned families who
prefer to grind their own pepper rather
than risk the chance of adulteration.
The pepper mill dates back to the time
when pepper was a scarce commodity
and was always ground at the table
from the peppercorns. Pepper was so
valuable In those days that rents were
often paid in peppercorns, and the high
prices they brought were among the
incentives that induced explorers to
brave the dangers of j the unknown
deep. If a short passage. could be dis
covered to the Indies, it was agreed by
all that" a wealth of pepper could be
easily brought to Europe. ,
The Visible and Invisible.
The wisest Indian philosophy has
never boggled, like ours, over that silly
word "supernatural." The Upanishad
Bays, "What is In the visible exists also
In the Invisible, and what Is In Brahrn'B
world Is also here." The ultimate, al
beit unreachable, Is as real to the Asi
atic mind as rice, and In the Bhagavad-
Glta.ArJuna Is actually permitted to
behold the embodied infinite. Indeed
it is rather this present existence which
India regards as the Illusion, the maya.
To see the stars we must wait for
night, and to live we must die. Nor Is
it uninteresting to note In Hindoo clas
sics how these large and happy sereni
ties of oriental view have Softened per
sonifications of death.— Sir Edwin Ar
nold.
Old and Good.
Many young men fail in life because
they don't know a chance when tliey
have It and only "know what is lost
when it Is too late. These youngsters
who want to be masters over the men
who are educating them, and to whom
they owe the inspiration of their lives,
all wind up by being slaves. One les
son for all leaders— learn to obey till
you are able to command. This Is old
and good.— Schoolmaster.
The Celtic Affirmative.
In the speech of so highly developed
a people as the Celts there Is no equiva
lent to "yes." Thus It happens that
you shall never hear an Irish waiter
pronounce the shibboleth "yesslr" of
bis English confrere, for he invariably
expresses an affirmative by some such
phrase as "I snail, sir," "It is, sir."—
Blackwood's Magazine.' I
"Pleasant."
Nohead (as he prepares to . take bis
leave)— l can assure you, Miss Nicer,
the time has passed very pleasantly
this evening.
Miss Nicer (absently)— Yes; It Is a
pleasure to know it ; has passed.—
Scraps.
Everybody knows the phrase "All
tjbe world loves a lover," but very
few people know that Emerson said It
and that he said It In a slightly differ
ent way— "All mankind love a lover."

Genlns In the Bud.
A 'lady who was "Aunt Kate" to
James MacNeill Whistler all his life, al
though not a relative, gives in a Lon
don journal a glimpse of Whistler the
boy. She had known him ever since he
was a child of two years. She was a
neighbor of the Whistlers, and after a
long absence from home she called up
on them and asked at once:
"Where is Jemmie?"
. "He was in the room a few minutes
ago;", was the answer. ."I think he
must be here still."
Presently Jemmies tiny form was
discovered stretched on the undershelf
of a table. The . visitor went to secure
the prize and asked:
"What are you doing there, Jem
mie?" ; 7 .
"I'se dworin'."
In one small hand was a pencil, per
haps two inches long, and in the other
a morsel of paper about three inches
square. Yet in these tiny proportions
the little artist was even then doing
work that showed an exquisite prom
ise.
New and Old Wonders.
The seven world wonders of antiquity
were:
The pyramids, Babylon's gardens,
Mausolus' tomb, the temple of Diana,
the colossus of Rhodes, Jupiter's statue
by Phidias and the Pharos of Egypt,
or, as some substitute, the palace of
Cyrus.
The seven wonders of the middle
ages were: ' r .
The coliseum of Rome, the catacombs
of Alexandria, the greafewall of China,
Stonehenge, the leaning tower of Pisa,
the porcelain tower of Nankin and the
mosque of St Sophia at Constantinople.
The seven wonders of the new world,
are:
Niagara falls, the Mammoth cave.
Old Faithful, the tireless geyser in
Yellowstone park; the big trees (se
quoia) of California, the Grand canyon
of the Colorado, the great fresh water
lakes and the Great Salt lake.
Damp Weather and Health.
The Influence of damp weather upon
sensitive people is remarkable. If there
Is a-sore spot anywhere It hurts more.
Latent weakness of any of the organs
Is brought out by congestion and irreg
ularity of function. Suppressed coughs
Btart Into activity and neuralgic nerves
speak out. Old chronic rheumatism re
news Its life, while corns are aggra
vated. The pulse is slow, the heart
weak, the blood vessels lack tone, the
muscles are flabby, the venous and
lymphatic systems become engorged.
The mind Is languid and clouded.
There Is a general depression of vital
ity.
Men In Petticoats.
It will probably be a matter of sur
prise to the general reader to .learn
that the petticoat was first worn ex
clusively by men. In the reign of King
Henry VII. the dress of the English
was so fantastic and absurd that it was
difficult to distinguish one sex from the
other. In the Inventory of Henry V.
appears a "petticoat of red damask,
with open sleeves." There is no men
tion of a woman's petticoat before the
Tudor period.
Real Work.
"I've just been reading Gladstone's
life and the work he did. He gov
erned the nation, wrote several books,
studied two languages, saw a hundred
people a day and answered all bis mall,
besides sitting up all night reading
Homer."

CROWDED -THE HOUSE.
The Successful Scheme ot a Theat-
rical Press Agent.
An agent who was hi despair owing
to his failure to get, any ; advertising
that had not been paid for found him
self in a big, western city with his at
traction playing to strong competition
and something | desperately j needed to
attract public attention to his show.
In one scene of the play a pah? of hand
cuffs . figured. The agent had an ln-
Bplration. He had the star snap a
handcuff on her wrist, and then the
agent concealed the key, saying It had
been lost The star was compelled to
finish the act wearing the handcuff
dangling from her wrist The audi
ence knew it should not be there, and
comment, was aroused. Between' the
next two acts the agent drove the ac
tress swiftly to police headquarters,
near at hand. The police captain was
mysteriously called out Ho was in
formed that the actress must have the
handcuff removed at once and secretly,
as she did not wish news of her pre
dicament to get out The chief brought
out a big bunch of keys, and finally the
handcuff was removed, but not until
a dozen alert reporters had snuffed a
"story" and were plying the reluctant
press agent with questions. Finally
the whole story was pumped out of the
agent, the star, having returned', to fin
ish the play. Next morning the first
page of every local, paper had a fine
story, descriptive *of the plight of the
actress who had .accidentally fastened
a handcuff to her wrist. The public
was interested and flocked to see the
play, and the resourceful agent went
on to the next town wondering what
new thing he could spring on the sen
sation lovers there.— William. Lof tus in

A Haitian Glass Ere.
Some years ago a Haitian general
wrote to a Paris optician to supply him
with a glass eye. The optician, flatter
ing himself that a successful eye would
secure for him a Haitian decoration, de
voted his utmost Intelligence to the pro
duction of a splendid glass optic. '" Six
months elapsed. A small box reached
him from Haiti. A cross glittered in
his .imagination; but, to :■ his - horror, :
within folds of cotton, wasi his original
eye, accompanied by . the i following
note: "Sir— The eye you _f orwarded to
me is of a tint that resembles that of
I the Spanish flag, and I am too patriotic
to wear any but the color of my. coun
try."' The optician proceeded ' at once
to the admiralty, there ascertained th«
colors of the Haitian flag and then man
uf actured a scarlet , and I green eye,
which he forwarded.' :
Successful Reminder.
A small church was sadly In need of*
repairs, and a meeting was held with a .
view to raising funds for the purpose.
The minister having said that | $500
would be needed, a very wealthy and
stingy member arose and said he would
give $1. Just as he sat down a large "
piece of plaster fell from . the celling
and struck him on his head, whereupon .
he jumped up hastily and said that he ;
had made a mistake, , that he . would ■
give ?50. This was too much for an en- :
thusiastlc deacon present, who, forget
ful of everything, called out fervently:
"O Lord, hit him again! Hit . him
again I"— Mount Morris (111.) Index.
St. Martin and the Dictionary.
St Martin when he divided his cape
with a naked beggar at. the gate of
Amiens gave also two words to ' the
English language. The oratory In which
this torn cape was preserved aa a sa
cred banner acquired the name of "cha
pelle" (from the French "chajje"), , the
custodian being termed "chaplain," and
thus our English ■ words "chapel" . and
"chaplain"., are derived.— Westminster
Gazette. ...
Transformation.
An English farmer had a number of
guests to dinner and was about to help
them to some rabbit when be discov
ered that the dish was cold. Calling
the servant, he ' exclaimed, "Here,
Mary, take this rabbit out and 'eat It
and bring It back a little 'otter!"

TYPHOID GERMS. ;
SB9>pi .'•'#* ■■<■"■■ k
mi in
The microscope shows that in the blood
of every person suffering from typhoid the
little germs can be found as shown above.
They are supposed to get into the water or
milk we driuk. The germs multiply so
that one germ is capable of producing
about one hundred trillion germs in twen-
ty-four hours. That is why if they eter
get into the water supply of a town they
multiply so fast that nearly everybody
drinking the water comes down with the
disease. There are exceptions, however,
and they are the persons whose health is
perfect, whose blood is pure, and liver
active. When the germs get into a healthy
body they are thrown off with the other
poisons. Recent Chicago statistics show
that one-eighth of all the deaths in the
past two years in that city have resulted
from pneumonia.
The best advice we can give is to put the
body into a perfectly sound, healthy condi-
tion. Be assured that you have nch, red
blood and an active liver.
Many years ago Dr. R. V. Pierce, who is
consulting surgeon to the Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute at Buffalo, N. V.,
found certain herbs and roots which, when
made into an alterative extract (without
the use of alcohol), seemed to be the very
best means of putting the stomach, blood
and vital organs into proper condition.-
This seemed to him as close to nature's
" way of treating disease as it was possible
to go. For over a third of a century Dr. [
Pierce s Golden Medical Discovery has had
a wonderful sale and the cures resulting
from its use are numbered by thousands..-
It is a tissue-builder, better than cod liver
oil because it does not sicken the stomach,
or offend the taste. It strengthens or
renews the assimilative or digestive pro- -
cesses in the stomach and puts on healthy
flesh when the weight of the invalid >a
reduced below the normal.
Accept no substitute for "Golden Med-
ical Discovery." Nothing else is "just aa
food."

GOOD ROADS.
To the rural inhabitant, especially,
and the urbarrite generally, thefore
; going headline is of more than pass
ing interest. While it is not especi
ally intended to mean that this is
the proper cognomen of the thor
oughfares with which our county is
blessed, it is simply a hint as to what
might be. While we, of the county,
are possibly doing all in our power
to bring about such a desirable state
of affairs, without the assistance of
outside aid, there now appears a
chance for the national government
to not only become interested in the
improvement of Amador county's,
or even California's roads, but those
•of the entire commonwealth. At
least it will have the opportunity to
become interested, and no little re
sponsibility as to whether it does or
not re.sts with the people them
selves. The federal government
takes care of its rivers and harbors,
protects its manufactures, helps to
; build cities, -but has never come to
consider the interest of
the man who supplies all these en
terprises with the actual necessities
of life — the farmer — to the extent
of improving his facilities for mar
keting his produce. However, at
this session of congress Messrs.
of Tenuessee, and Gal
linger of New Hampshire, have in
troduced in the house and senate
respectively, a bill which has for its
object the alleviation of the bad
road difficulty. The text of the bill
provides that, along with the others,
congress appropriate for the use of
road improvements the sum of $24,
000,000, available in instalments of
$8,000,000 a year for the years 1904 -
5-6; that the amount be apportioned
to each. state according to popula
tion, provided that no state receive
less than a minimum of $250,000,
and that in order for any state,
for county in same, to receive its
share of this money, a like 'amount
be raised for the purpose, where it is
to be used. In New ' Jersey, Con
necticut, Massachusetts, New York,
and Pennsylvania the state legis
latures have provided a law for state
aid for roads on something of the
same principle as the foregoing, and
the results have been far-reaching
and beneficial, and there is uo doubt
such a. move on the part of the na
tional government would not only
prove a blessing, but is a matter of
justice and humanity to those who
contribute more to the prosperity
and stability of the nation than- any
other class— the tillers of the soil. If
you. are interested in this matter
write your congressman to vote and
work for the passage of the bill.
SUPREME COURT DECISION.
We are in receipt of the full text
of the supreme court decision in the
case of E. H. Sanchez vs. E. Fordyce
and Thomas Ruiz. As the decision
touches one ef the vital points in
volved in the justices' and con
stable's salary cases now on appeal
to the supreme court from Amador
county, a brief statement of the
issue decided will not be without in
terest to our readers. The litigants
were rival candidates for constable
: in. Ventura township, Ventura coun
ty. Sanchez was an independent can
didate, nominated by petition. The
republican and democratic parties
each nominated two candidates for
r cons table; as the election proclama
tion of the board of supervisors
called for the election of two con
stables'in that township, notwith
standing that the county govern
ment act of 1901 provided that in
township having a population of less
than 6000 there shall be but one jus
tice and one constable. It was con
ceded that Ventura township con
tained less than 4000 people. In the
recount Sanchez was found to have
received the greatest number of
legal ballots, and was elected, the
court refusing to count any ballot
on which more than one candidate
for constable was voted for. The
supreme court sustains the lower
court in this view. In the course of
the decision the court says.
The additional point is here made
that, as sec. 5 art. 11. of the constitu
tion authorizes the legislature to "reg
ulate the compensation of all such
officers (county officers) in proportion
to duties, and for this purpose may
classify the counties by population,"
therefore it cannot directly or indirect
ly, classify the counties for any other
. purpose than the one purpose of regu
, lating the compensation of county offi
cers. We agree with appellants' coun
sel that under this provision of the con
stitution, the legislature can classify
countios but for the one purpose,, of
regulating the compensation of county
officers. It has been so held by this
court, Pratt vs. Brown, 135 Cal. 650.
It cannot classify townships for the
purpose of regulating compensation.
This part of the decision is taken
to be plainly indicative of the fate of
the salary cases from Amador coun
ty. .The last legislature did classify
the townships of Amador county ac
cording to population for the pur
pose of fixing the compensation of
township officers. In so doing, the
supreme court says the law-making
body exceeded its authority. This
point is .clearly placed in issue in
the Amador cases, so the outlook is
bright that the county will win iv
this important suit. Several other
counties have appealed i>n the same
proposition, but Amador has* takeu
the initiative, and will probably be
the first to get a decision.
In our article on hospital finances
last week, we overlooked the point
that the allowances for outside pa
tients aggregated nearly $300 last
year, and this system of supporting
outside patients was not inaugurated
until after the- present administra
tion .took charge. This reduces the
difference in.' the cost of hospital
maintenance for the years 1900 and
1903 to something over $600 as
against the latter period. This is a
really creditable showing, consider
ing the enhanced price of supplies
and the increased .number of inmates.
The Ledger again reiterates its
settled policy that, outside of the
regular Sunday services in the
churches, no free announcements in
advance of entertainmeuts for the
purpose of raising funds, no matter
for what object, will be made in
these columns. All such notices are
advertisements, and can only ap
pear as such.. ._•';.

THE OTAPOB LEDGER; JACKSOK, CALIFORNIA, FBIDAY, JAKUABY 29, 1904.
The Frederickjon— Yager Suit.
As this case has awakened much in
terest in lone and the valley section,
and is also of interest, owing to the im
portance of tho law points involved, " to
business men everywhere, we deem it
proper to explain its status. Yager
and the late Thomas Fredorickson were
partners in the cattle business in lone
valley. The affairs of tho co-partner
ship were attended lo and managed by
Geo. Yager. Frederickson died on the
23d of August, -1903. Iv April preced
ing, Frederickson deeded . bis interest
in the property embraced in the ■co
partnership to his wife, Adelina Fred
eriokson. "This deed was placed on
record in the recorder's office in Sep
tember following, a month after tho
death of Froderlckson. The recording
of the deed was the first intimation
that Yager, had of the transaction. Ho
had never boen noli God by his partner
that he had transferred his interest to
his wife. It ia contended on tho one
side that the; deod from Fredorickson
to his wife dissolved tho partnership of
Yager and Fredericksoif. It is con
tended on the other band, however,'
that a_ co-partnership cannot ho ;dis
solved in this one-sided manner; that
ono partner cannot substitute a person
of his own choosing to take his place in
tho firm without tho other partner's
consent. Furthermore, it is held by
the Yager side that the death of. Fred
erickson, not the deed to his wifo, I dis
solved the partnership. On the 12th
of December Mrs. Frederickson com
menced suit in the superior court j for
an accounting of tho partnership prop
erty, and asked for the appointment of
a receiver to take possession of the
property and wind up the affairs. : On
the 14th of December the court ap
pointed Thomas Clifton as receiver, fix
ing the bund at $2000. On the same
day a copy of the complaint and sum
mons, also of tho order appointing a
receiver was served upon defendant
Yager, who promptly took steps to
sustain his side of the controversy.
By his attorneys, Messrs. Bole and
Vicini, a motion was promptly made to
have the order appointing a receiver
vacated, on the ground that the ap
pointment was wrongfully procured,
and that ho was incompetent. The
hearing was had on the 23d of Decem
ber, and a mass of affidavits read in
support of each side. The main con
tention is that the surviving partner is
of right tho proper person to wind up
tho partnership affairs. The court re
fused to vacate the order appointing
Clifton as receiver. • From this order
the defendant proposes to appeal to the
supreme court. He has filed a bond in

FATAL ACCIDENT AT ZEILA
John Silva Struck by ".a r Bock and In-
stantly Killed.
About four o'clocVon Tuesday after
noon a pall of sadness was thrown
around the home of Jahn Silva when
tho announcement came down from the
Zeila mine, where he was employed, of
his having been killed. In fact, the
expressions of sorrow over his untimely
end were on the lips of tho on tiro com
munity as the news of .the tragedy
spread.- It seems that' Mr. Silva and
his partner had about finished up the
stopo at the 1200 level, in which they
were " working, arid preparatory to
leaving it were cleaning up all the
stray patches of ore to be found. In
his search for scattered bits of ore,
Silva had found quite a slab on the
hanging , wall over his J head, -i He so
cured a bar and sot about to pry it off.
For some little time the rock resisted
his efforts, and he, possibly thinking it
more secure than was really tho case,
ventured too near, when, without a
moment's warning the rock came down
with a crash, pinning his head between
it and one of the outer posts of a set of
timbers. The fatal result was almost
instantaneous, as the victim was only
hoard to utter two words afterward,
those being the name of his partner.
The alarm was given immediately, but
before the other miners in the vicinity
reached the spot, life was extinct, and
John Silva had finished his last shift.
As soon as possible the remains wore
taken out of the mine, and the coroner
notified, • who conveyed the departed,
loved one to the homo of his grinf-"
stricken wife.' An inquest was held
Wednesday morning, at which the facts
as above stated wore brought out. i M.r.
Silva was a native of Portugal, having
come to this country early in life. He
had livod in Jackson for more than ten
years past, where as a man and miner
he was known as one of the best. He
had been in the employ of the Zeila for
almost a year, and Manager Detert
pays him great tribute not only for his
skill as a miner, but for his sterling
character as a man. He is survived by
a wife, one child of his own, and four
step-children, his wife being a widow
at the time of their union. While his
demise is a severe and irrepar
a_blo loss to Mrs. Silva,' from an in
cident in their lives learned from an
acquaintance just after the fatal catas
trophe, it was the sad fulfillment of a
constant fear which was over present
in her heart. As the story goes, Mrs.
Silva bad accompanied her husband to
the shaft at the Kennedy mine, whore
he was then working, on one occasion,
and just as he was about to step into
the skip to go down, as was her usual
custom she kissed him "good-bye."
Tho incident brought a smile to the
countenance of a witness standing by,
and she explained to him that each
time Mr. Silva loft her to go into a
mine she was possessed of the morbid
fear that he might never return alive,
and that this was an invariable token
of a last farewell. The decedent was
an honored member of tho local lodges
of Knights of Pythias, A. O. U. W.,
Foresters of America, and the Miners'
Union, all of whom contributed their
share in making the burden of sorrow
as light aa "possible) for tho grioving
lovod ones. The funeral occurred from
the homo of deceased, and was con
ducted under tho auspicos of tho
Knights of Pythias, assisted by all tho
other fraternities of which he was a
member. i

A DETERMINED SUICIDE.
Katie Thompson Takes a Fatal - Dose of
Carbolic Acid.
Miss Katie Thompson committed
suicide early Sunday morning at the
residence of her sister, Mrs. Williams,
on Water street, Jackson, by swallow
ing a large quantity of carbolic acid.
The young lady was a cripple from
childhood. She was able to get around,
and hired out as a nurse whenever she
could. It was pitiful to soe her walk,
and there was no hope of any improve
ment. She came here from Seattle a
few years ago, and we are informed she
had made ono or two previous attempts
to end her life bofore coming to Jack
son. Within the last few days she had
complained of sickness, and appeared
more than usually despondent. Indeed
she had intimated to a neighbor that
she felt like ending it all. . That she
had contemplated suicide for a long
time is evident from the fact that the
poison had been in her possession for a
number of months. She waited on
Thos. Greonhalgh during his last ill
ness, and she had occasion to get a two
ounce vial ol carbolic acid. One half of
it was used; the remaining half is bo
lieved to have remained in her posses
sion ever since,' and was the means of
her taking off. On Ihe fatal morning
she got up about seven o'clock. Mrs.
Williams was preparing tho breakfast.
Miss Thompson came down .from, her
room, and took a seat . in the room'
where her sister was at work. .At
length Mrs. Williams was attracted by
a gurgling sound, and looking up, at
once saw that something serious was
the matter. Miss - Thompson had
swallowed the entire contents of the
vial of acid. The fiery fluid had scorched
her mouth, and left its mark upon her
chin and throat where it bad trickled.
She was unable to speak and it is prob
able that she was unconscious from al
most the moment that she swallowed
the draught. Medical aid was sent for
at once. Drs.' Phillips and Schacht
were on hand within a quarter of an
hour, but it was too late to avert a fatal
termination. The victim left no note
to throw . any light on the tragedy.
Tho cause was evidently a despondent
frame of mind, owing to her life-long
deformity. Her ' friends had noticed
some time ago the bottle containing
the poison, and thinking she had self
destruction in mind removed the bottle.
This she at once noticed, and demand
ed the restoration of the bottle, and it
was surrendered. This was some time
ago, and the deceased must have hid
den the acid away from that time, as
those in the house never saw it until
the fatal morning.
Coroner Huberty held an inquest the
same day, with the following named
persons empaneled as a jury: E. W.
Kelley, J. F. Mora, B.F. Gilbert, W.
H. Carley, W. J. Love, C. M. Meek,
Frank Burgin, J. R. Smalllield, L.
Vandament, C. F. Kochlor and J. Bar
ton. The above facts were elecited at
the inquisitiou. The only witnesses
examined were Dr. B. H. Schacht and
Mrs. Emma Williams. The jury re
turned a verdict of death by carbolic
acid poisoning, administered by her
own hand.
Miss Thompson was born at Mokel
umne Hill. Her parents are both dead ;
the mother being buried at the Hill,
and her father at San Andreas. She
lived in Jackson several years ago, but
was away in Washington for some
years, and returned to Jackson from
that state about two years ago.
The funeral took place Tuesday, and
was largely attended, the remains be
ing interred in the protestaut cemetery.

If the merchant or business man of

Supt. Web Smith of the Kennedy mine,
he will readily bo convinced of the
error of his way.- In last Friday's issue
of the Ledger an attractive ad for
mules for use in the mine appeared.
The ad called for animals weighing not
less than 800 or 900 pounds. The ink
had hardly dried on the papor before
an enterprising mule owner, who reads
a good -newspaper, was on the scene
with an animal that seemed as big as
an elephant. : However, owing to the
cost of enlarging skips, tunnels and
drifts in order to operate with so
large a variety of animal locomotion,
the offering was declined, and the
paper hastily notified- to change the
words "notlessthanßooor 9oo pounds,"
to "not more thau 800 or 900 pounds."

MINING NEWS HERE
AND ELSEWHERE
News from Mines of the Eastern Sec
tion of Amador County. — Defender
. Still in a Prosperous Condition.
Old Gold.— While all prospects da
not make mines, it goes without say
ing that, as a rule, the latter has never
been obtained before the former. The
largest and best paying mine on the
mother lode in this county was at one
time a mere prospect, and no doubt, in
years to come, the same will be said of
the country off the mother lode,' in the
eastern ' ! part of Amador county.
Among the promising prospects there
are the Old Gold and New Discovery,
located about 2 ai[\isa north of Pine
Grove, and owned by the Cranmer
Bros. This property has been develop
ed to the extent of a shaft, 100 feet
deep, which is tapped by a tunnel 300
feet. The values are found in an iron
atained quartz, and also in talc. The
owners are taking out a little pay rock
right along, which is treated in a small
mill' equipped with two 1000-pound
stamps. At present, as. only develop
ment work is being done, the mill' is
not kept going steadily, but as progress
is made the ore is sorted and milled.
The mill will handle 8 tons of ore every
24 hours . .
Elephant Placer. — As the prin
cipal industry in Amador county, of
course the lode mines hold the large
part of the balancn of power, but in
summing up the output of the county
the gold taken from its beds of gravel
cuts no insignificant figure. This
particular part of tho industry is for
the most part located along the streams
in the vicinity of Volcano, where, al
though the gravel was washed li f ty
years ago, the pay dirt is as rich as
when first discovered. Just recently
Messrs. Bradshaw, Santirfoand Baroni
have leased a strip of ground, contain
ing 4 acres, on the Elephant placer,
that was left untouched wlieu the prop
erty was last operated. They expect
to operate with one hydraulic pipe,
equipped with a 6-inch nozzle. The
gravel ranges in depth from 1 to 5 feet,
and as it prospects well they anticipate
a good clean-up. Owing to the state
law requiring tho permission of the
debris commission before any mining
of this character can be undertaken,
they cunnot commence work tiil ''that
body passes upon tho same, which is
Being looked for now daily.
Marsino Bros. — Among tho oper
ators in the placer industry, probably
those gentlemen are the largest. at tho
present time.' They are now, and have
been for some time, vvcrkingon 45 acres
of ground right on the edge of the town
of Volcano, in what is known as the
"lava beds." The "lava beds"- are
large areas of gravel completely cover
ed with a heavy layer of lava. Owing
to this lava covering it is impossible to
work with the hydraulic process. In
addition to this covering of lluty like
rock over the gravel, it is streaked
through at intervals with thin stratas
of cement. This latter contains much
good pay, and after coming in contact
with the open air slakes so that wash
ing is possible. Sometimes, however,
it is stored till a quantity sufficient has
been acquired, and crushed in a stamp
mill and the gold saved on plates. The
Marsino boys now have a two hundred
foot tunnel in on their ground, and are
now running cross-cuts in order to
easily work the gravel. In working
this ground the gravel is taken out in
cars and stored till sufficient has ac
cummulated to begin sluicing. After
the tunnels have been driven, a cross
cut is run on either side at its breast,
and work is commenced toward its
mouth. In this way the waste is thrown
behind the miner, while nothing but
pay dirt is taken out. Owing to the
nature of the lava covering no timber
ing is necessary in the tunnels', and, in
fact, very little timber is used in min
ing the gravel. Where dirt has to be
mined at so great a disadvantage, it is
needless to add that it must necessarily
be very rich to make pay. But, ac
cording to T. A. Marsino, there. is
good pay in thoso beds all tho time,
and occasionally a streak is encpunter
ed that runs to a handsome figure in
deed. Thirty-t}ve cents is no un
common thing, and 75 cents is quite
frequent.
Christenson Claim. — This old
property, which has in tho past pro
duced a large amount of placer gold,
has recently passed into the hands of
the Grillo Bros., and last week James
Grillo and another man began the eon-:
tinuation of the 500-fqqt tunnel, with
the view of qpening up new territory.
This property is supplied with a Hunt
ington mill and a good water right, and
it is expected when.- sufficient pay dirt
has accummulated to run most of same
through this mill. In addition to this
placer enterprise tho Grillos own a
quartz claim, known as the Columbus,
located about 3} miles south of Vol
cano, which they will likely take up
and give spme attention to this spring.
As yet the Columbus is only a prqs
pect, but of so good a nature as to al
ready justify the erection of a 5-stamp
mill by the former owners. However,
the only development so far done is a
240-foot tunnel on the ledge, which cuts
it at about 90 feet. With the showing
tho property has already made, they
believe it will require only a small
amount of sinking to put it in condi
tion for steady production.
THE DEADVVOOn.— WhiIe the theory
that where gold is found in the gravel
deposits its source of supply is to bo
found in ledges in the vicinity has in
many instances been disproved, it cer
tainly seems to be an established fact
in the hills around Volcano and Pe
fendor, where pno soes proof aftor
proof of its o-ertainty. At present
Kirn ball Bros, are operating tho Dead
wood, located about one milo north of
Defender, They are working the prop
erty by shaft, whjjjh is now down
about 60 feet. At this point water was
encountered to so great an extent that
further work was impossible without
an improvement on the windlass and
bucket hoist. In consequence of this
they have just recently purchased a
plant of machinery, consisting of a
boiler, pump, . and small hoist, which
will enable them to sink to a depth of
200 feet. This machinery is now being
installed, and it is expected not later
than this week to continue sinking.
iThe ledge is well defined between walls
of granite, ranging'in width from 6
inches to 2 feet, and the development
work being done is not all dead by any
means, as the pay streak is sufficiently
good to make the expense very light
on the operators. This is proven by
the fact that a run of 19 tons of this
ore through the Sturnaraan mill at the
old Belden mine, gave a clean-up of $32
to the ton. As a prospect, nothing is
more promising than the Dead wood,
and the Kimballs have . the staying
qualities to fully determine its merits.
Defender.— lf there are any skep
tics in this county or elsewhere relative
to the merit of the mineralized ledges
in the Pioneer district, they certainly
are proof against argument made of
absolute facts. The Defender mine,
employing about 19 men and constantly
producing good pay rock, seems to the
writer sufficient evidence that this part
of Amador county is yet to make its
mark as a gold producer. The De
fender also proves the fact that the
Pioneer , district offers good induce
ments to the small operator — the man
who is unable to pay for large plants of
machinery. The greatest depth so far
obtained on this property is 320 feet,
but at the 100 and 200 levels much
drifting has been done on either side of
the shaft, and between these two about
half the ground opened up has been
stoped. At the 300 level the ledge is a
width of about 16 feet, and here about
140 feet of drifting has been completed,
but as yet but little of this ground has
been stoped. For the present the en
tire force of the. mine will be devoted
to taking out this large body ' of min
eral, and a little later in the spring
manager Joyce, who is the principal
owner, intends starting down again.
The ore in the ' Defender consists of
both a mill and smelter product. The
former, of course, is a clear quartz
rock,' while the latter is an iron pyrites
heavily stained with copper of the pea
cock variety, and is almost identical in
appearance to the ore produced in the
Glacier and Revenue tunnel mines in
Ouray county, Colorado, . one of the
largest properties in that part of the
state. The mill ore, Mr., Joyce tolls us,
runs as high as $35 to the ton, although
the average is $10. His smelting pro
duct, of which he had about 3 tons
sacked ready for shipment last Satur
day, averages about . $70 to the ton.
The mine is equipped with a hoisting
plant,' Hendy rock breaker, and ton
stamp mill. The hoist, though small,
will sink to a depth of 900 feet. The
ore is sorted at the collar of the shaft;
that for the mill being trammed a dis
tance of about 100 feet, when it is
dumped on a grizzly, the fine stuff pass
ing to a 25-ton storage bin below, the
large dropping to a reserve bin above
the crushor, into which it is fed auto
matically. As yet no plan for conten
traling the tailings from the plates has
been adopted, but Mr. Joyce, has con
cluded to save the tailings from now on
for future. treatment. While he does
not impress one as an optimistic dream
er, Mr. Joyce does not hesitate to say
that the Defender is a good paying in
vestment now, and he believes is the
making of one of Amador county's
biggest and best producers. '
Argonaut. — There are between
30 and 40 men now employed at this
mine. At the 1600 level the station
has been cut, and drifting toward the
ledge is how in progress. Everything
is moving along nicely.. While the
new levels are being opened, it is the
intention te sink the shaft another 200
feet. ■ . •
MISCELLANEOUS.
Ross Morgan has been surveying the
past week the boundary line between
the Zeila mine and the Pleming prop
erty, recently purchased by Fred
Eudey. -
While in Volcano recently, the Led
ger man was informed that not an idle
man was to be found in that camp.
And, too, the boast was made that
they were all working for themselves.'
This speaks well for any community.
The old McLaughlin placer claim,
Volcano, is being worked by the San
tirfo-' Bros. They have made some
good clean-ups in the past, ' and are
getting good gravel now.' 7
As soon as the weather conditions
improve, Wm Bellderain expects to
continue sinking on his Caslota claim,
located about 2 miles south of Defender.
He has a well defined ledge on the
property, and has gotten good returns
from ore treated in the past. So far,
though, the ore has been pocketty, but
he thinks very little more depth is nec
essary to make the ledge more regular,
and of sufficient size to pay. While at
his place we were shown some, of the
most beautiful specimens of free gold
quartz one can find anywhere.
Which Is It?
When one frequently hears the ex
pression that "so and so thinks he
owns the earth," the remark is treated
as a joke, but when an individual in
business, regardless of ita oharacter,
actually assumes that he is the abso
lute owner of all business of the general
public in his community, in his line, he
is either a dreamer, an egotist, a fool,
or afraid of competition. Such a man
hasp't the slightest conception of what
business principles are. He is simply
trying to get and retain a h.old on the
community through sentimentality
pure and simple. Business men, as a
rule, consider well their ability to hold
their own against any and all competi
tion, in thuir line, in. the community
they select for the investment of their
capital, and when legitimate competi
tion comes they meet it like men, not
by whining that because of their hav
ing happened t,o cast their lots in any
certain place, its people owed them a
debt of gratitude, which should be re
paid by indignities to an individual
with an equal amount of enterprise to
whom, as far as sentimentality goes,
as much regard ia due as to any other
goqd citizen, Of course, it isn't often
one comes ia cQntaot with this class of
business(?) men, but when he is en
countered people wonder if he was al
ways the baby boy of his father's
household.

Shenandoah Valley, Jan 19.
To-day mother earth is clad in a
beautiful white robe — a very : suitable
kind for. the season.'. But for the thin
ness of the robe and the lack of sleigh
bells we could almost imagine we had
been transplanted to another clime, . so
great is the change in a few days.
However, as .''Variety is the' spice of
life" we enjoy alittlesnow occasionally.
The majority of the farmers in this
vicinity have finished their j seeding.
The crops' are looking very well con
sidering the cold nights.
The holiday season is now a thing of
the past, and we > are all back to the
old routine of life again, working with
the same object in view — the almighty
dollar. ■ .
; School has re-opened and work' is
going on smoothly under the I supervis
ion of Thos. Davis as teacher.
Mrs. Service, who has been the guest
of Miss Maude Brown for the past two
weeks, has gone to Amador City for a
few days, and from there will return to
her homo near Modesto.
Mr. and Mrs. S. H.* Phillips expect
soon to move to Plymouth, where they ■
will make their home. ..... «'. ■ '

A FAMOUS PERFUME.
Delicious Attar of Roses Is Chiefly
Made In Bulgaria.
The far famed otto (or attar) of roses
Is chiefly, made in Bulgaria. Kasanllk
Is the center of the rose growing coun
try. Red roses only are used in mak
ing the perfume, but white roses, which
grow more freely, form the hedges of
the fields.
The trees, which grow to* a great
height, are separated by paths nine
feet in width to allow the oxen and
plow to pass. The perfume is obtained
not only from the petals, but also from
the stalks and leaves. These give a
peculiar scent, which adds greatly, to
the delicacy of the perfume of tho
petals.
October, April and June are the
months for planting branches of the
old trees. Weeding, pruning and digging
are necessary for three years, when
they are full grown and repay the labor
(spent upon them by bearing for twenty
years.
The discovery of the delicious attar
was quite an accident and took place
three centuries ago. The Persian Prin
cess Nour DJlhan was strolling through
the splendid galleries of her palace
with ■ her betrothed (the Mongolian
Prince DJihanguyr) and noticed in the
rosewater - basins about the passages
an ugly, yellowish oil floating on the
surface. Orders were instantly given
to remove the unsightly fluid, when it
was discovered the perfume. was also
removed. Thus the virtue of the essen
tial oil was found out, which Is still
called in Persia "Attar DJlhan."
Culture and Riches.
If one-tenth as much attention were
devoted to the fools among the middle
and working classes as is devoted' to
the fool sons of the rich, we should be
ln danger of believing with . Carlyle
that the people are "mostly fools." It
is true that the culture of the suddenly
rich Is cruder and narrower than the
culture of those who have had genera
tions of wealth and leisure, but culture
Is relative. The culture of the most
cultured classes in the old world is the
result of large wealth possessed for
generations. Culture is a matter of
growth, but it never grows in poverty.
The cheapness of the culture of the
very rich In this country as compared
with that . of the aristocracy of old
countries Is simply, the difference be
tween youth and age, a difference of
experience. There Is a comparative
cheapness in the culture, bearing and
manners of the people of the west
as compared with those of the east,
and for the same reason. The aristoc
racy of the south and of New England
have a refinement quite unlike that of
the newly made rich in New York and
Chicago and the west They have been
longer ln the making.— Gunton's Maga
zine. '
SlinviiiK the Bridegrroom.
The shaving of the bridegroom on his
wedding day is a Bulgarian custom
which, handed down from pre-Chris
tian days, Is still observed j with due
formality, especially in country dis
tricts. While the barber Is at his
task a dancing crowd of young folks
surrounds him and the bridegroom.
As the tatter's hair is cut the snippings
are carefully collected by some of the
girls for preservation in one of the
bride's chests. The barber, when his
work is done, receives a small white
linen cloth as a present and also a
trifling sum of money from each person
there. ■ Then the bridegroom kisses the
hands of the girls, washes his face and
dons his' wedding dress, which must
first be carefully weighed three times
by one of the boys.
Highland Makeshifts.
A few years ago accommodations In
the highlands of Scotland were very
primitive. It Is related that the young
Duchess of Gordon, on Inquiring how
the late duchess managed to entertain so
much company at Klnrara, where there
seemed no room, was told by the butler
that for weeks at a time be had slept
on the top of the kitchen dresser. A
niece and two other young ladies were
known to have slept in the duchess'
bedroom, which probably was not large,
for they were sent out to wash in the
neighboring brook. Miss Macdonell of
Glengarry, who told this, said also that
there was a waterfall near Ochtertyre
which the late Sir William Murray and
his brothers used as their shower bath.
Creaaes In Draninga.
Creases In drawings, engravings, etc,
may be leveled out by following these
Instructions: Fasten the engraving or
drawing by drawing pins on a board,
face downward, on a sheet of paper; on
the back place another sheet of paper
which retains a very slight quantity of
moisture. Over this place flannel or
blotting paper, and, taking a hot iron,
pass it carefully over the part where
the creases have been made until thfty
disappear and then submit the draw
ings or engravings to pressure between
printer's glazed boards.

"Well, Frederick," said the caller,

VORACIOUS CANARIES.
Appetite of a Bird Much Greater
Than Avejasre Man's.
When an old fashioned hostess
urges her guests to eat, after the con
ventional manner of showing hospi
tality and remarks, .'fWhy, you haven't
the appetite of a bird," she really
speaks the truth, though she dees not
Intend to. . --.
The average man, if he had a bird's
appetite, would devour from thirty to
thirty-one pounds of food a day, which
would be a tax on the larder of his
hostess.
Recent experiments have proved that
the average bird manages to eat about
one-fifth of his own weight dally with
ease, if he can get so much food, and
in a wild state, though the bird has to
hunt for his daily provender, he is eat
ing a large part of the time during the
day and manages to get his full ra
tions.
The smaller the bird the more vora
cious seems to be its appetite and its
power of absorption. -
* A German scientist ' recently kept a
canary under observation for a month.
The little creature weighed only j six
teen | grams, but ln the course of the
month it managed to eat 512 grams
weight of food— that is, about thirty
two times its own weight The bird
must therefore have eaten . its ' own
weight in food every day. . '
An ordinary man with a canary's ap
petite would consume 150 pounds of
food a day.-
But the canary is an extreme case.
The ordinary bird, in good health, will
be satisfied with one-fifth of its weight
a day by way of food.— Answers. . ■ .
Laat British Lottery.
I have ln my possession, writes a con
tributor, a notice bearing date Oct 17,
182G, inviting persons to take part hi
the last state lottery which was held ln
this country, says a writer in the Lon
don Chronicle. This Invitation is a
very elaborate affair. It Is printed in
green and yellow. At the top are the
royal arms, while below, in the center
of the paper, -is the announcement:
"Positive! By order of the lords of his
majesty's treasury, on Wednesday
next, 18th October, lotteries close for
ever ln this kingdom. Six prizes of
£30,000 will be distributed on that day
as the parting gifts of Fortune." The
advertisement concludes with a foot
note to the effect that Slvewright Is
selling lottery shares and ! tickets at
37 Cornhill, London.- This man Slve
wright was a well known stock and
share broker of the day, who made a
specialty of lottery tickets. He was
very fond of attracting clients by the
publication of doggerel verses, mostly
of the simplest character, of which the
following is a fair example:
Then gallop on gayly;
The fault is your own
If you don't get a good share
Before It's all gone.
One of Japnn'a Jewels.
The great attraction . of Kamakura
and one of the jewels of Japan is the
Daibutsu, or great bronze Buddha. We
approach it through a tree lined ave
nue and get the first and best view of
it at a distance of some 200 feet It is
a sitting figure, 49 feet 7 Inches high,
97 feet 2 inches In circumference. The
face is 8 feet 5 inches long and from
ear to ear 17 feet 9 inches wide. The
eyes, which are pure gold, ore nearly
two feet long. The circumference of
the thumb is three feet. Those figures
give some idea of the size, and the fig
ure is elevated on a stone platform
some twelve. to fifteen feet above the
person approachiug it. But no descrip
tion can convey an idea of the majesty
of the face. It is bent gently forward
as if in brooding contemplation of the
infinite. It represents perfect peace—
the repose of the attained Nirvana.
Fortunes In Picture Frames.
Some splendid picture frames may be
seen every year at the Royal academy
exhibition, but the finest and costliest
frame ever made for a picture was that
which incloses the "Virgin and Child"
in Milan cathedral. It is made of ham
mered gold, with an inner molding of
lapis lazuli. The corners of this valu
able frame have hearts designed in
large pearls and precious stones. Some
Idea of its value may be gained when
it is stated that the frame is eight feet
Song and six feet wide. Its estimated
worth is £23,000. One of the pictures
in the Vatican at Rome is in a frame
xtudded with jewels. The picture is
a'valuable one, but the frame nearly
equals the value of the painting.
Flat? ' Pole*.
With proper care a flag pole ought to
last a great many years in spite of the
Incessant exposure to the elements. Of
course the best preservative of wood is
puint, and a man who has a flagstaff
which has cost him a good sum of
money should see that It is painted at
least once every twelve months. Flag
poles generally rot at the bottom first
and then have to be taken down to pre
vent them from falling of their own
weight

OBSOLETE TERMS.
Some Bta; Words That . Have Becit
j Consigned to Oblivion. . -
The number of obsolete words that
are to be found in a complete diction
ary of the English language Is consid
erably larger than the people have any
idea of. The following letter, written
by an alleged poet to an editor .who
had treated his pdetry with derision.
Furnishes some Idea of them:
"Sir— You have behaved like an im
petlginous scrogle — like those who,
envious of any moral celsltude, carry
their unglicity to the height of creating
symposlcally the fecund words which
my polymathic genius uses with über-
Ity to abligate the tongues of the weet
less! Sir, you -have crassly parodied
my own pet words, though they were
trangrams!
" "I will not coascervate reproaches. I
will oduce a veil over the atramental
Ingratitude which has chamfered even
my indiscerptlble heart. I am silent
on - the ■ focillatlon which my coadju
vancy must have given when I offered
to become your fantor and adminicle.
I will not speak of the llppltude, the
oblepsy you have shown ln exacerbat
ing me, one whose genius you should
have approached with mental discal
ceatlon. So I tell you, .without super
vacaneous words, nothing will render
ignosclble your conduct to me. I
"I warn you that I would vellicate
your nose if I thought that any moral
dlarthrosis thereby could be performed
•—if I thought I should not iinplgnorate
my reputation. Go, tachygraphic scro
gle, hand with your, crass, inquinate
fan torsi Draw oblectations from the
thought if you can of having synchron
ically lost the exlstlmaOon of the great
est poet since Milton."
And yet all these "words are to be
found in the dictionary.— Tit Bits.
The Bridal Veil.
The origin of the bridal veil is a dis
puted question that will probably never
be settled. Some j see in It nothing
more than a milliner's substitute for
the usual flowing tresses which half
concealed and half revealed a bride's
beauty as she knelt at the altar. This
opinion is countenanced by the fact
that Elizabeth Stuart was not thought
to require an artificial veil, as nature
had given her an affluence of hair.
Others see its origin In the veil of the
Hebrews', marriage j ceremony or the
yellow "flammeum" " of old Roman
brides.
A third source is the old "care cloth"
of, the Anglo-Saxons, a square vestment
held over both bride and bridegroom
till they received the nuptial . benedic
tion. So runs the use of the church of
Sarum and the Hereford missal.
Lastly, it has been held to be merely
an amplification of the coif which medi
aeval brides wore between the garland
and their hair. . Margaret Tudor wore
this under her coronet on her marriage
to the king of Scotland.
Evolution of the Bed.
Bedstead originally meant "the 'bed
place." The truckle bed was the first
advance on the bench, and then the
tester suspended from the roof. Then
came ln the Arabian bed — a name per
haps derived from the crusades, j The
four poster came from Austria in the
fifteenth century. The late Queen Vic
toria always carried her bedstead about
with her, and so did the nobles ln the
middle ages. The coverlid or counter
point, whence comes counterpane, was
often splendidly embroidered. Yet the
beds at this time wero often only sacks
of straw. Feather beds came from
France In the fourteenth century, but
straw was in general use long after.
Blankets' of wool were not introduced
by Blanket of Bristol, who made them,
for the word, in the sense of a coarse
woolen fabric, existed before.
Very Abaentmlnded.
The celebrated German historian
Theodor Mommsen was the -most ab
sentmlnded of men. Once wnile going
from Berlin to Charlottenburg, a half
hour's journey, the" trolley car in which
he rode went off the track. . The rest of
the passengers took another car and
went ahead, and the stranded vehicle
was abandoned till help could be found.
Mommsen remained reading his book.
An hour or two later the sound of
Jacks, levers, derricks, etc., aroused
him.' Rising from his seat, he went to
the door and, with the most complete
unconcern I imaginable, remarked, "I
suppose we have come to a standstill!"
The Polite Germans.
We Germans are not only the most
polite, but also the most ceremonious
people in the world. Without ceremony
it Is not possible for us to present a
friend, to take a seat in a restaurant or
to drink or even to utter a single word.
Consequently a people like the British,
which ignores and utterly disregards
these customs, must appear to us a herd
of lubbers.— Frankfurter Zeitung.
A lilne ot Action.
"You see," said the young, lawyer,
"my client Is accused of bigamy, and
he's guilty; so I hardly know how to
defend him."
"Why, that's easy," said the old law
yer. "Defend him on the ground of
Insanity and get a few henpecked hus
bands on the jury."— Puck.
Cause For Worry.
■ She— Why do you look so worried,
Bertie? Did papa object?
Bertie— No. But he said: "It's all.
right You'll soon find out It's useless
to object when Nell is set on anything."
Invitations.
Archie— See how I am run after. All
these are Invitations.
friend— <}ood gracious! All invita
tl6nsl Invitations to what?
Archie— To call and settle accounts.

His Satanic Majority.
During the American Revolutionary
war the colonists 'had 'great trouble
with women who were determined roy
alists. "The sex," wrote the rebellious
governor of New Jersey," "are mis
tresses ;of Infinite craft and subtlety,
and I never read of a great politician
who did not employ petticoats to ac
complish- his designs. Certain it is that
the greatest politician on record (I
mean the devil) . applied himself to a
female agent to involve mankind in sin
and ruin." '"',
Dean Plgou tells in his book of anec
dotes the story of the little "girl who
was much upset by a maiden aunt and
posted in a hole in the garden a letter
ln these terms:
Dear Mr. Satan— Will you kindly come
and take away Aunt Jane? She i 3 a very
fussy ■ person and does worry ■me so.
Yours affectionately, [ ALICE.
Cariosities of Cat Glass.
The process of glass cutting requires
great skill and care. A design is first
lightly copied on the glass, and the
cutters take it in hand. A fine stream
of sand and water falls continuously
on a rapidly revolving steel wheel. To
this" the glass is applied, and the cut
ting is really accomplished by the fric
tion which the sand sets up. Then an
other workman with another steel
wheel and plain water brings the cut
ting up to a sharper edge. A third
workman with a soft wooden tool takes
off the cloudiness caused by the fric
tion of the steel, a fourth polishes the
glass, a fifth with a preparation of ox
ide of tin gives to it that iridescent
luster which makes us value cut glass
so highly.
A Compliment.
-Mrs. Hersey was unhappy ; over the
stern severity of her new photographs.
"Norah," she said to her pretty wait
ress, "do you think this photograph
looks like me?"
Norah's warm Irish heart came to tlw
rescue. "Shure, Mrs. Hersey, dear."
she replied quickly, '.'if you looked like
that would I ever have two af ternoorw
a week?"— Christian Register.
Feeding: on Souls.
' A certain minister \ applied to l»l«
church for an increase of salary.
"Salary!" cried one of tbe membera
"Salary! Why, I thought you worked
for souls."
"And so I do," meekly replied the im
pecunious minister, i'but I cannot 'eat
souls, anil, if I could, it would take a
good mrjiy souls the size of yours to
make c decent meal."
Not Hl* Experience.
Mrs. Henpeck— Let me see, is it "big
amist" or "polygamist?"
Mr. Henpeck— What are you talking
about?
Mrs. Henpeck— Why, a man who has
one wife too many is a "bigamist,"
isn't he? .
Mr. Henpeck— Not necessarily.—Phil
adelphia Press.
An Unreasonable Fellow.
"Oh, if s no fun being engaged to
him," she said bitterly.
"Why not?" asked her dearest friend.
; "Why, when you stir up a little quar
rel just to drive away the ennui : h*
takes it seriously and keeps you wor
ried for fear you've really lost him."—
