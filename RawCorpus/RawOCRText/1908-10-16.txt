which took place at the First Presby

Silas Penry on His Canvassing Tour
It appears from the following ac
count of a meeting of the democratic
candidates in Sacramento, that Silas
Penry, formerly of Jackson, is having
a strenuous time in his candidacy ou
the democratic ticket for .Assembly
man against that veteran republican,
Grove L. Johnson:
Penry was introduced by Chairman
Sullivan, Penry^took occasion in the
course of his speech to call attention
to tho record ot his opponent, Grove
L. Johnson, who has always been sub
servient, he said, to organization
interests. After declaring Johnson is
not a man who serves the best in
terests of the people, Penry said :
"And nowjl askfyou for your votes.
1 want tho votes ot all tho people.
"No," said the candidate tor the
assembly, after a pause, "1 don't
think 1 do; 1 don't want tho vote of
the chief editor of The lice, and 1 am
inclined to put the chief editor of the
Union in the doubtful column also."
"Then where do you expect to get
your votes from?" inquired suine in
dividual from the audience.
"From the people," replied Penry,
promptly.
"Well, you'll get it in tho neok,"
returned the man who had put the
question.
A GOOD nEASON.
Jackson People Can Tell You Why
It Is So.
Doan's Kidney Pills cure tho cause
of disease, and that is why tlio cures
are always lasting. 'This remedy
strengthens and tones up tho kidneys,
helping them to drive out ot tho body
the liquid poisons that cause back
ache, headache and rlistrutiding (Sid
ney and urinary complaiutß. Jackson
people testify to permanent cures.
Mrs J. Cook, living on Hroadway,
Jackson, Cal., suya: "1 nau vouch
tor tbo merits of Doan's Kidney Pills.
1 suffered from kiduey trouble for a
long time and nothing helped me

LE DOUX CASE
RE-SUBMITTED.
The Stookton Independent of yes
terday says :
Emma LoDoux, oonvloted of the'
murder of Albert N. MoVlonr In the
famous trunk myslery case, and'
sentenced by Jadge Nutter to be
hanged after one of the mast note
worthy criminal trials that has ever
been conducted lv this section of the
state,' ia among the happiest of
women. £»*ijj •'";*£!
It has been ordered by the supreme
court that her case be re-submitted
tnr oral argument before the court
sitting en bano nt Saoramento. The
death of Justice MoKnrlnnd made
necessary the order. No date has
been set for the bearing.
The case attracted unparalleled .at
tention throughout the country at
the time and the successful prosecu
tion of the case by District Attorney.
McNoble, owing to the unusual cir
-cumstanoea of the murder and the
lack of seemingly the main essentials
to bring about a conviction, was
heralded as one of the most brilliant
achievements by. way of prosecutions
that has been recorded in this section.
It will be recalled that Km run Jjo
Doux and Albert N. McVicar visited
Stockton and took up apartments at
the California house. Later a- big
trunk was brought to their apartments
by an expressman. The trunk, sup
posed to be tilled with dishes, was
removed from the room and taken to
the Southern Pacific depot. It re
mained there several days, until
peculiar odors from tho trunk aroused
the suspicion of agent Thompson,'
who .was then in charge, and the
oftlcials were notißed. The trunk
was opened and the teet ot MoVioar
shot upward as though released by a
spring. It was demonstrated during
the trial that MoVicar had drunk
chloral in some whiskey. Mrs Le
Doux was sentenced to be hanged.
An appeal was taken by Attorney C.
U. Fairnll. Mrs Le Doux is still in
the local jail.
Short Allowance for Power.
JJecauae of the continuance of dry
weather, and the shortage of water,
everything ""dependent upon electric
and water power ia running on short
shift. For weeks the mills running
by electricity have been bung up
between the hours of 7 and 9 every
evening, I that : being the time the
heavy tmlllc is ou in San Francisco.
The street lights have been shut otf
from Jackson. During the daytime
no electrio lights are permitted atter
U o'clock in the morning. This
policy is to eoonornizo water as much
as possible for the benefit of the
mining industry. The mines will be
kept going so long as the power sup
ply holds out. JMost of the power ia
now coming from outside the county.
If the rains do not come within the
next two weeks the famine will . be
come serioua for all interests.
For Chronic Diarrhoea.
"While id the. army in 1803, 1 was
taken witb chronic diarrhoea," suys
(ieorge M. Felton of South Gibson,
Pa. "1 have since tried many
remedies but without any permanent
relief, until Mr A. W. Miles, of this

Cattle Getting Out.
The Plasse brothers started yester
day morning to bring down the bal
ance of their stock cattle from tho
mountain ranges. All stockmen who
have stock still in the mountains are
driving out as fast as possible. Tho
lack of water in the home ranges in
duced them to continue as Jong as
possible in the mountains. The
advent of rain hns relieved the situa

the end of this week or the beginning
of next. 'J he mine is looking well,
as well, bo we are informed' as at any
period in ' its history. Dividends
have not been resumed, but the .sur

Amador's Mineral Output
For Last Year.
State mineralogist L. E. Aubeiy
has just lesued the bulletin showing
the mineral production lor the
various counties of the state for the
year 11)07. Aooordiug to this the
total mineral product of Amador is
given as follows:
Gold - - - - 82,110,182
Sliver - - - 8.9G7
Copper ..-- 1,020
liriok and pottery clay - 13,992
Limestone - ... 1,200
Total value 82,145,009

The total mineral output of our
neighboring counties is given as
follows: Calnveras, 81,789,012; Tuo
iumne, 0U8.119; El Dorado, 8113,113,
These figures show the ngßrogato
valuo of all minerals produced. It
will be seen that Amador oouuty
holds up its output much better than
most of the other counties on tho
mother lode. We stand third in the

A BIG BALL CAME.
Jackson Wins From Sacramento.
The basbeall game last Sunday
between the regular team of tho Jack
sou social aud athletic club, and a
nine from Sacramento, was the
biggest event in that line that has
been played in tho county for years.
It drew an immense concourse to the
grounds just beyond the Zeila mine,
lilveiy town in the county was repio
seuted, and many came from beyond
the Amador boundaries. The visiting
team arrived about 11 o'clock Sunday
morning in two automobiles, and
were greeted royally by the local men
in true sportsmanlike fashion. They
came full of confidence in their
ability to win easily. Indeed, they
were under the impression that they
were up against novices in the game.
At the outset a bet of 8100 was staked
on the outcome, Sacramento made
the bind', and it was quickly called
from the Amador side. The Jackson
boys were in tine form for playing.
They were conscious that they were
pitted against good players; and re
solved to give the visitors the best that
was in them. They acquitted them
selves well. Jn the first innings the
Jackson team scored two runs. This
was the only score made during the
game.' The Sacramentos did their
best to score, but without [avail, aud
at the close of the ninth innings the
score stood 2to 0 in favor of the
home boys. This is the [[biggest vic
tory scored by Jackson yet. The
Sacramento team has been defeating
everything they went against right
along, and expected to do the same
here. The line-up was as follows:

We may state that the difference between the higher and
lower rates shows the amount levied for road purposes in the
respective counties. For instance, in Amador couuty the
outside rate is $2, and the inside rate, or the rate for the in
corporated city of Jackson is $1.55; the difference of 45 cents
represents the levy for road purposes, which is not collect
able within the city limits. There are fourteen counties in
the above list which have a higher tax rate than Amador,
five other counties having the same rate, and thirty-two with
a lower rate. Yuba has the distinction of being the heaviest
taxed county in the state, $2.70. Siskiyou enjoys the repu
tation of the lowest taxed community, $1.45. This is re
markable for a sparsely settled and to a great extent unde
veloped border county of large proportions. As a rule the
mining counties are pretty well loaded up with the exactions
of the toll gatherer, while the agricultural sections are com
paratively lightly taxed. As cempared with last year the
rates are slightly lower, owing chiefly to the reduction of 4^
cents in the state tax. Twenty-six counties have managed
to reduce the tax levy, while thirty- have imposed higher
rates than for the preceding year. The average rate for the
58 counties iv 1907 was. 1.5364 and for 1908 it is $1,5153.
So that the average reduction throughout the state is less
than the reduction of 4^ cents on the state tax. From this
the conclusion is inevitable that while the rate for state pur
poses has been reduced, the saving thereby effected has been
more than offset by the advanced rates for county purposes.
The average rates herein given are for the county funds only,
leaving the state tax out of the calculation. The tax rate in
Amador county is about 3A Jcents on the $100 higher than
the average throughout the state. On a basis of a total as
sessment of $5,500,000 this amounts to a trifle less than
$2000 per year that Amador property holders are called
upon to contribute for local purposes over and above the
average county rate. No solid' reason can be advanced why
this county should be above the average at all. In a small
territory like Amador, with the population concentrated
within comparatively narrow limits, and without any in
terest-bearing indebtedness, the tax rate ought to be below
rather than above the average.
The unprecedented quietness of the present presidential is
somewhat of a poser for the political wiseacres. It is equally
hard to explain the reason of it. or what it portends. Neither
side has any advantage in this respect.
Every voter should turn out to hear congressman Kngle
bright, who is scheduled to speak in Jackson on the 24th
inst. Let it be the meeting of the campaign, as a fitting
recognition of a faithful and able representative.

According to this eatimate, which
appears to us to be a reasonable one
at this time, 'lutt and Sherman will
receive just twice the number of
electoral votes^that will be oast for
Kryau aud Kern. The campaign has
been devoid of enthusiasm, brags
bauds, marching clubs aud red ike
up to the present time, but the press
throughout the country reflects a
fixed aud sturdy determination to
contiuue the Roosevelt policies of
applying tho laws of our country to
the rich and the poor alike, giving to
every person, corporation, or associa
tion a squaro deal. This sentiment
will grow stronger as election day
approaches, aud many independent
and couseivative men who entertain
a frieadly feeling for Mr Urjiin will
go to the polls ou the 3d of .November

"Lot well enough alone," aud cast

Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises an area of
648 squaro miles. It lies on the wee
tern »lopo of Sierra Nevada mountains,
and embraces within Its territory all
the diversity of valley, foothill, and
high mountainous land*.
Climate.— The climate of tho popu
lous portions of tbe county Is as gonlal
and healthful as can be found anywhere
In California. As climate Is one of the
most valuable assets of this favored
state In attracting population, Amador
stands second to no county In this re
gard. It should, and no doubt will in
time, when Its climatic advantages are
more thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, become a health resort not
only for those in less favored states,
but for the residents of other parts of
California. The temperature alone the
central portion rarely falls bolow 30
degrees above zero In winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees in tho sum
mer. Snow seldom falls in the settled
districts, and never remains on tho
ground for more than a few hours. Of
course, In the high mountain regions
of eastern Amador tho snowfall Is very
h ea vy — which is characteristic of the
entire Slorra Nevada range. The sum
mer season is alway accompanied with
cool nights; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs are rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
Infrequent.
Mining.— The county, although
rich in other sources of wealth, com
paratively untouched, is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mine 9. The
deepest gold mines in America tire lo
cated here. The Kennedy mine Is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
3000 feot below the surface, with every
indication that tho pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold, the county has contrib
uted fully 8100,000000 to the world's
supply of the precious metal. The
mines are still yielding at the rate of
about two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
eight or ten mines operating on what
is called tho "mother lode," stretching
clear across the county in a north-east
erly direction a distanco of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate between
400 and 500 stamps, und furnish em
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
industry is still in its infancy. The
unexplored territory, even along the
raaiu gold belt, is far in excess of the
{.'round that has actually been worked
or prospected . The county offers to
:lay one of the most inviting fields to
be found anywhere in the world for the
investment of capital in the fascinating
business of gold mining, not alone along
the mother lode, but also in the almost
untouched mineralized country ot the
east belt, some ton or twelve miles from
ihe main lode.
Besides gold, we have copper, do
posits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
limestone, granite, and soapstono or
talc— all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities.— The agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce, anything that can be
ijrown in the most favored sections.
In the foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetable are raised where irrigation
is practicable along the numerous water
courses. Further up in the mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet, the
soil is admirably adapted for apples
and potatoes. A ready market for
many times the quantity now raised of
these commodities can be found lln the
various mining towns.
Grape culture and wlnomaking are
becoming Important industries, both
the grapes and wino commanding a
better price than .the product of the
lowland.
Land is cheap compared with other '
California lands. Improved farms may
be secured for one-fourth the price
uurrentin some places. Unimproved
lands can bo had from $5 to $10 per'
;icre. It does not require a fortune to
buy a small ranch. There Is room for
:i largo addition to our agrlculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts now devoted to
cattle ranges might bo made the homes
uf hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Araador lias a population of less than
12000. Threo fourths of this is concen
trated la a strip of throo miles above
nnd below the mineral belt.
Jackson, the county seat, has about
MOD inhabitants, and is tin Incorporated
;ity ot the sixth class. Other towns
ue Sutter Creek, Amador City, Dry
bown, Plymouth, Volcano, Pine Grove
nnd Oleta. lone City is the metropolis
uf the valley section, a thriving town
if 1000 inhabitants.
The community Is law-abiding. Edu
cational facilities are excellent. A
ichool house 19 within easy roach of
learly every family. There Is ono high
school, located at lono.
The assessment roll for 1007 is 85.
500,793, and the tax rate for both state
md county purposes $2 ou tho $100.
The Southern l'aclllo has a branch
•uilroad ruunlng to lone. From this

ends 14 miles, further to the mining
oction.

An Old English Law
We came aoroas a queer little item
In an exchange a few 'days ago. It
wna an old Ktigliah law passed during
the reign of Queen Ulizabetb. Parlia
ment solemnly enanted, "that any
woman who from that date, would
deceive or cajole into matrimony any
of the subjects of ber majesty by tbe
use of false hair or any other thing
false iv connection with the body, or
by tbe use of cosmetics, would be
punished as for fraud' aud deceit,
with intent to cause harm."
It was said this law was designed
for the protection in England of the
persecuted male box, and no man bad
ever had tbe courage to revoke tbe
law, and it now stands on the statute
books of England.
It is very well to try and protect
poor, persecuted men, but the men
in our country don't need such a law,
for they marry with their eyes wide
open, and now almost every woman
they meet in fashionable society is
'made up"; nnd on tho woman's part
there is no effort to deceive and she
goes about her adorning quite openly.
Ihe "rats" and "mice" that adorn
ber head are very peroeptible, ' tbe
paint on her faoe shows for itself.
Une day you meet a woman with dark
hair; the next it is {bright red or
golden, just as the fashion of tbe day
calls for, and so on with tbe body
false bust, false hips, and anything
else false that adds to tbe looks. So
if such should be tbe law in our
country, few women would marry,
it seems a pity women could not
realize how much more attractive
tbey ,'aio as Uod made them, and
should be content to stay so, for
such aids do not add at all to
their good looks, for all wbo look
upon them know tbey are false. It
has been very truly said—
"Ihe woman neglects her heart
Who studies her glass."
"Uoan's Ointment cured me of
eczema that bad annoyed me a long
time. The cure was permanent."—

Taking Care of the Feet.
To keep tbe feet in good oouditiau
it is ueoesaary to batbe them three
times a week and to look after tho
□ails onoe a week. If they perspire
a great deal, dissolve borax in the
water, wash them thoroughly, keep
ing them in the water fifteen minutes,
aud wipe dry. This may be done
every night before retiring. Dust
them in tbe morning with a powder
composed of four parts talcum powder
aud one part boraoio noid thoroughly
mixed. This checks perspiration aud
adds greatly to oue's comfort.
Corns are very painful, and when
they aie new may be removed by
rubbing with pumice stove. If of
long standing, make a poultice by
soaking light bread iv vinegar Bye
minutes aud bind it to the corn at
night, lv tbe morning keep the foot
iv warm water tun minutes and tbe
oorn will be easy to remove. Wearing
one pair of shoes iv the morniug nnd
another in the afternoon rosta the
feet wonderfully. Nothing is more
restful to tired feet than the salt
water bath. Tbiß is prepnrfld by
adding a tableepoouful of coarse suit
to a quart of watrn water. After
they are removed from tho water,
wipe dry with a coarse towel.

and relatives for a few days.

lieasb, is in attendance at tbe store
during her father's illness.
(Jilenn Ullbert paid Jackson a flying
visit the first part of tbe week. He
claims be was over to see ' Mr Strobm
about road work, but the loads as a
general rule don't interest tbo young
men. I think there must be far
better prospects in or around tbe city
for him than road work, at least it
looks that way.
The brush fires were raging above
Oleta last week, but no damage was
'done except, the loss of some tences.
Miss Katie Sohroeder is reported
notto.be so well for several days
past.
Henry Nelf 'a family are talking of
moving above Indian Diggings, where
Henry. is employed as ditch tender.

DEMOCRATIC RALLY.
Walter McArthur Addresses Citi
zens From a Labor Standpoint.
Toe first politloal gun in Amador
county for this presidential campaign
was flied by tho democrats on Wed
nesday evening, it was announced as
a detnooratlo rally, and Walter Me-
Arthur, was billed as the centre
attraction. In faot, be was solitary
speaker, except the preliminary small
talk by locals. Tho weather proved
anything but propitious from a
political outlook. The rain was
descending in torrents when the time
for opening the meeting drew near.
The Military band played in front
of Love's ball to gather the crowd.
Somehow there was a noticeable
failure to respond by a .gonoral out
pour of citizens, as was wont to bo
the ense in years gone by. The
attractive force of campaign oratory
has been on the wane for years. The
enthusiasm of hand-clapping and
cheering, and brass bands and pro
cessions have id a great measure
ceased as the necessary nocompoui
ments of the spell-binders.
When the hour for opening the
meeting came, the hall was a Jong
way from being filled, indeed the
empty spaces were as conspicious aa
the tiled seats. Dr. Endicott, as
chairman of the county central com
mittee, opened tho meeting by a brief
speech, in which he jokingly said
the democrats were certain to elect
(bree candidates, namely, Utruhm, as
supervisor, Judge liiist tor superior
judge, and William Jennings liryuu,
as president.
H. C. Bole waa elected chairman of
the evening,' and spoke briefly, and
announced eight or nine vice-presi
dents, among them being James Mee
han, C. L. Culbert, T, tiedgepeth, C.
(Jiovannoni and L. U. Ulnvinovich,
who were called to the platform to
grace the background of the meeting,
and do the lion's share of the hand
clapping and cheering in a perfunc
tory way, at any pointed remarks of
the speaker. *
Waiter McArthur was introduced.
He is president of the Seaman's
Union and editor of the Pacific Coast
Seaman's Journal, the organ of that
union. He said he had been identifi
ed witb the labor movement all his
life, and was there to talk from a
labor union standpoint. ' lhat if the
issues of the campaign were oontlned
to tariff or financial matters, he
would not be taking part : in the
canvass. He admitted plainly' that
the vital question to him and others
associated with him <n unionism, was
the stand assumed in the platforms of
the two great parties on the question
of injunction and the judiciary. He
then went on to explain the labor
movement, claiming that workingmen
could not get a square deal from their
employers unless they were organized,
and worked as a unit. Unions had
different ways of enforcing their de
mands for improvement of their con
ditions of employment. There was
the strike and the boycott. 'ibey
appealed to the publio through a free
press, tho light of assembly and free
speech. They depended upon tbe
sympathy of the publio for their
rights. If tbat sympathy was on
their side they would win, if other
wise, they would lose. The evident
drift of tbe argument was that publio
opinion should be tbo oourt of appeal
without any interpolation of tbe
iirocesuns of the courts, by injunc
tions. In other words mob law
should prevail. Tbe democratic plat
form advocated radical changes in
the judicial branch of the govern
ment by curtailing the power of tbe
courts to issue injunction in labor
disputes. He contendod tbat the
stand ' of tbe judiciary in such
matters, if continued, would destroy
the labor union movement. Hence,
he was in favor of Bryan and demo
cracy, because of tbe curbing of the
judicial branch in the interest of
labor disputes.
lie was also in favor of the liryauite
proposition of government guarantee
of deposits in banks. The present
banking system was about tbe worst
that could bo. Any change must be
In tbe direction of improvement. A
change could not possibly be for the
wdi'ho, and with this lucid exposition
of this financial question, be retired,
and tbe meeting was at an end.
A a soon as he quit talking .there
was a scramble of those perched on
the platform to get down from their
conapiouous position as quickly as
possible. In their haste to retreat,
they forgot all about JJryuu and
deruooraoy. So that not a solitary
cheer went up tor the peerless one.
It waa a cold wind-up, prelude to
the chill blasts that will roll from
tbe ballot boxes In November against
the fantasies of iiryan in li is third
and last campaign to capture the
presidency.

A Pioneer Lady Passes Away.
Mrs Wildman of Sutter Creek, died
In tbe Children* Hospital of Han
Francleoo. on Wednesday evening
last, atter n long Illness. Ueoeaeed
was one of the pioneer women of
Amrt'ior county, having arrived here
In the early fifties with her husband,
W. T. Wildman, and settled in Sutter
Creek. Her hnsband preceded her to
the grnve about nine years ago. l)n
ceaaed waa a woman of enteemnble
Qualities, and liked by all with who
she became acquainted. She leaves
two daughters, Mrs W. <l. Modee of
Sntter Creek, and Mrs J. Kirklaurl of
Los Angeles; also a slater,* Mrs C.
C. Holding, of Oroville, formerly of
Butter Ceek. The remains will be
forwarded to Sutter Creek today, mid
tbe funeral will take place In that
town at 2 o'olock tomorrow.' .
Tho Prig and Hit Cane.
In the number of the Tatler for Oct.
0. 1700, it Is observed lhat "n cane i*
part of tho dress of v prig" (this, b.v
tho way. shows the erroneous notion
prevalent that "prlgglsliness" la fl
ir.otlorn word) "and always worn jlfjoa
v button. Tor fear lie should bot boil gilt
to have an occasion for It or bo csteo:u
nd really nnil not genteelly a crlppJc."
In the number of Nov. 18 v rural
squire In tnwu Is sketched who I;} the
prototype of one of the puvouiont nui
sances: "illy arms naturally swung at
mi unreasonable distance from his
skies, which, with the iidvautage of v
CUD.B that ho brandished lv a great va
riety of irregular motions, made It un
safe for any one to walk within sev
eral yards of him."
And under date of Dec. r» there is nu
amusing sketch of "a lively, fresh col
ored young man" who was iiinong the
applicants to Isaac Blck'erstuff's court
of censorship for license to use "canes,
perspective glasses, suufTboxos. orange
flower waters and the like' ornaments
of life." This young man had his cane
hanging- on his fifth button and. was
"an Oxford scholar who was just en
tered at the temple."
.A Wedding Superstition.
It has been considered unlucky to bo
married In May ever since the days of
Ovid, and those people who have spent
their time in - looking up roots and
reasons have given what they consider
to be the origin of the superstition as
follows: .
In ancient Home there was held in
Hay a festival called the Lemuria, or
feast of the liemures, which was a
ceremony In honor of the speeches of
departed eonls. It became with tbe
Romans what we should call "bad
form" to have matrimonial feasts at
the season of a solemn ritual, being no
doubt thought io toe an Insult to the
dead to marry at such a time. From
this n number of stories grew of the
revenge made by the outraged ghc«ls
upon .those "who dared to disregard
them! and lf anything unfortunate hap
pened to a couple who had been mar
ried in May it would, of course, have
been put down to retribution. So the
tradition of ill luck nrose, and its in
fluence . has lasted ever since, even to
our time.
Towed by a Halibut.
About the mouths of the streams on
which salmon camps are situated tho
Indian dogs and children amuse them
selves catching the fish. Some of the
youngsters are so small that after they
have succeeded in cornering a fish
the combined efforts of the party are
often required to dispatch it and carry
it to camp. I have watched dogs run
ning about In a rift snapping at the
salmon and apparently having the time
of their lives.
One of the most amusing sights that
I saw during my stay in Alaska was
two Indian boys being towed about
the harbor at Kadlak by a huge hali
but they had just hooked. Utterly un
able to land the fish, they had fastened
the line to the stern of the boat, and
while they pulled with all their might,
each one at an oar, they rallied each
other for not exerting more strength
and shouted loudly for help. Finally
an Indian put out in a boat, and tbe
fish was landed.— Forest and Stream.

Great Lovers of .Water.
The Slatrit'L'o are more di'vcti'il to the
water than any other nation lv the
world. They are nearly always bath-
Ing, gonemlly with their clothes on,
find they never go auywhere by land
If they caa possibly go by water. Tho
streets of ltangkok are lite those of
Venice, and tbo luliabltuuU say that
their Idcn of paradise would be n town
with cauals where there were currents
In both directions, io that they might
bo spared tbo effort of rowing.
The Sorrow of It
"It's too bad." observed tut! man who
seemed to bo thinking aloud.
"What's too bad?" queried tho party
who had overheard tho observation.
"That our neighbors always know
when wo havo fried onions for nupper,
but never get next when wo havo
strawberries and Ice cream," explained
tho noisy thinker.— Chlcugo News.

Democratic Political Tactics.
At the McArthur democratic meet
ing Wednesday ulgbt, everyone that
went inside the bail was handed a
four page sheet professing to show
that tbe republican and democratic
presidential oandidates occupy ex
treme opposing views on tbe question
of Chinese aud Japanese immigra
tion; that while Urymi is in favor of
a strict exclusion law, the republi
cans favor tbe admission of Asiatics.
Such political tactics are reprehensi
ble. They appeal to prejudice from a
false foundation. Everyone knows
there is no division of sentiment on
this question; that republicans end
democrats alike do not want to admit
Asiatics. Hooaevelt, wheu the ex
clusion of Japanese from tliu schools
on San Francisco was a vital mutter,
bundled it delicately aud diplomati
cally, thereby avoiding unnecessary
friction. His views expressed at that
time wore distasteful to tbe Paoitin
coast dweller.-*, but he afterwards
acknowledged that he was mistaken;
and has done his utmost sinoo lo
settle this matter in favor of the ex
clusion policy with the Japanese
government. As a matter of tact
Japanese luboritH are no longer ad
mitted to tho United States. Knui
their admission to tbe Hawaiian
isjaods, where they constitute tho
major part of the labor element, is
beiug debated. To say that either
Knoseevlt or Tuft, or the republican
party favors Asiatic laborers id utter
ly fulse. These lying shouts do more
barm to tbe democratic cuuse Minn to
the ropubliniius. They indicate Low
hard pressed the iiryauite men ure
tor caiupuigu ammunition. Iho ex
clusion of Asiatics is a dead issue as
far as party policy is coucerued.
The screed circulated ou this subject;,
printed by order of the democratic
state central committee, mid bearing
the uames of John K. Itaker. chair
man and John Il'.I I . Murray, secretary;
concludes "liryau and safety, Taft
and danger, .what in your choice."
What an insult to tbo intelligence ot
American voters, tbo vast majority of
whom have mude up their tniuds tbat
the reverse would be about correct.
"Taft aud nufaty, liryau aud danger."

one precinot to another that were
not completed wheu this computation
was made, but that will not change
the total result. The total number
of names on tbe (Iront Register is
2583 against 3105 in 190U, or a loss of
522. Shu Andreas township is tbe
only one that shows a gain, it making
a gain of three names. Mokolumne,

BRYAN AND THE JUDICIARY
Wliiln Mrllrynn'H policies, flnnnolnl
and economic, are dangftrous enough
to alarm the entire business com
munity, they are really lest ominous
than hla attitude toward tbe American
judiciary. Mr Bryan's perpetual
candidacy la a protest, not only
Against established laws, but against
the rules and procesaea by which the
laws are Interpreted. , lie proposes a
radical curtailment of tbe powers of
our courts whereby those tribunals
would be shorn of prerogatives which
are essential to the correct and ex
peditions administration of juatlce.
The inevitable effect of bis soheme
for jury trials In cases of Indirect
contempt would be to destroy the in
dependence of the bench and deprive
It of a function wbiob ia a vital ele
ment of judicial authority. To hold
that an order id a case of contempt
should be enforced only after it has
been approved by a jury Is as absurd
as It would be to insist that a
sentence imposed upon a defendant
convicted of grand larceny should
also be suspended until it bad been
reviewed by a jury. The analogy ia
clear aud exact. Mr Bryan seeks to
strip the judicial otfloe of an import
ant function and transfer it to tbe
Thic, however, is the' least perilous
feature of Mr lirynu's program to
impair the judiciary. His Influence
as an agitator has been exerted to ex
cite publio distrust of our courts, to
undermine tbe abiding confidence of
tbe people in their integrity and to
inculcate tbe base belief that their
great powers have been exorcised for
the advantage of tbe few at the ex
pense of tbe many. He has insinuated
that justices of our highest tribunals
are appointed wltb a view to their use
fulness to great private interests and
in disregard tor tbe publio welfare,
tie has hinted that their decrees on
important consitutioual quostious
have boon controlled by improper in
fluences and ho has made it reason
ably clear that iv the event ot his
election he would appoint us judges
of the federal courts none but men
upon whom he could depend to up
bold bis discredited policies if
ocoasiou should arise.
Mr Bryan scott's at the popular com
pact which stipulates that our courts
shall be kept sacred from partizan
criticism. He cares nothing for tbe
fact that tbe people have, almost from
the birth of the republic, agreed that
our legal tribunals shall be held
above the rivalry of party contro
versy. Tbe whole tendency of his
utterances Jhuu been to belittle the
integrity and wisdom of our courts
In tbe respect of tbe people. Instead
of touching that our Ipgal tribunals
should be kept above suspicion he
has subjected them to irresponsible
partiznn criticism and contention.
In the event of bis election to the
presidency Mr Bryan probably would
have to appoint four justices of the
United States supreme court and ot a
much larger number of judges for
tbe lower branches of the federal
judiciary. % To entrust him with a
power of such grave import in its
possible consequences is a proposal
from which thoughtful citizens will
shrink in alarm. It would place in a
position of vast influence over our
highest legal tribunal a political
agitator of immature judgment and
untried doctrines who baa dono more
to impair popular confidence iv tbe
American judiciary than any other
man of our times.

A Great Work
The new Oxford dictionary, bagun
in 1888, has gone as far as Pieraious
and the editors hope to complete it
by 1912. It acoouuta are credible, it
is a meritorious work. The total
number ot oolumns already published
is 2k!,27£, each 10 1-2 inches long.
Placed end to end, 2 1-2 inches wide,
these oolumns would stretch 4 miles,
911 yards, 2 feet. t?o arranged and
placed upright the column would rise
nearly 24 limns as high as the tiitfel
Tower and about 5:5 times as high as
the Great Pyramid. The number of.
words main and subordinate is 224,01b.
According to careful estimates, there
are 34,351,081) words In the volumes.
A work of this magnitude thus de
scribed In terms ot Bpace and number
is, in no figurative sense, a monu
ment to its makerH. It is literally a
great work, and it should be added
that it is a noble worn of scholarship,
to which science, art and literature
are indebted in no mean degree.— St.

Why Colds are Dangerous.
Ijcchuso you bave contracted ordin
ary oolds and recovered from them
without treatment of any kind, do
not for a moment imagine that colds
are not dangerous. Everyone Knows
that pneumonia and chronic catarrh
have their origin in a common cold.
Consumption is not naused by a cold
but the cold prepares the system fcr
the reception and development of tbe
germs that would not otherwise bave
found lodgment. It is tne same with
all infeotious diseases. Diphtheria,
scarlet fever, measles and whooping
oouch are much more likely to be
contracted when the child has a cold.
You will see from this that more real
danger lurks in a cold tban in auy
other of the common ailments. The
easiest and quinkest way to cure a
cold is to take Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy. The many remarkable oures
effected by this preparation have,
made it a staple article of trado over
a large part of the world. For sale by

SILAS McBEE FOR TAFT
Keßardlesfl of imHtJulJiliutionp, stud
ents of affairs, delvers 'and tbinkers,
are last lining up for Judge Tuft. A
recent example is that of Silas Me-
Uee, editor of the "Churchman," of
New York. In an interview be says:
"1 am a North Carolinan by birth
and lifelong democrat. 1 snail vote
for Mr Tuft because he has it in his
heart to tiring my people of tbe .South
buok iuto absolute union witb tbe
national life i.ml to their historic
place as a controlling force in tbe
nation, and to do wbicb would
immortalize him as a statesman.
"1 shall vote for him boonusu be
more nearly represent:.! my ideas of
government, of soaial order and
economic policy tban any living
demoorat. or any man before the
people today, save alone Theodore
Koosevelt, who is tbe only republican
president 1 bave ever voted for. Mr
Tuft has administered every trust
committed to him |by the nation
with an eye single to tbe nation's
good and for the highest interests of
the people that compose the nation."
Will Not Seal Divorce iPapers.
When au interlocutory decree of
divorce wus granted today by Justice
Aspinall iv tbe JJrooklyn supreme
court to a wealthy man, 11. tiartol
Hull jr., an attempt was made to hiive
tbe papers sealed ou tbe ground that
wbile tbe co-respondent, Key.
Benjamin Deubam, former pastor of
the First Church of tbe Disciples of
Curist of this city, had eloped with
Airs Hall, be "bud a good reputation
otherwise."
Justice Aspinall rui'ueerl to seal tbe
papers. "1 am in favor." eaid thn
court, "of full publicity in all court
proceedings. Jt is au outrage that
millionaires cau have their divorce
papers sealed from tbe public, wbile
people ot small moans cannot."
■ J'be lawyer asked secrecy for tho
woman's tmke aud argued that [tliin
was a Case which tbe newspapers
wonid gloat ov«r, as Uev. Dr. Deu
bam is still preaching, being now in
Missouri.
U"1 hope," replied the justice,
"that rhi.s preacher gets all tbe dia
graoe and publicity that's coming ro
him. The newspapers don't fgloat
over a case of tbis kind. It is a
public duty for tbe newspapers to
advertise the disgraoa of lawbreakers.

Governor Cummins' Prediction
That Jiryan bus a place Iv the

That is ono reason why Oovoiucr

LOCAL EDITORIAL COLUMN.
The opening of the campaign in Amador county from the
Bryanite side must have been decidedy disheartening to the
supporters of the peerless one from Nebraska. In almost
every respect the gathering was in painful contrast to the
political meetings of years gone by. It may be true, that
republican meetings nowadays suffer also by comparison with
those held during a presidential canvass of bygone days. The
general enthusiasm that found vent in torchlight processions
blazing bonfires, and and outpouring of citizens from far and
near, is largely lacking. But the democratic whoop-up this
week was remarkable for its shortcomings in other ways,
as showing the steady decadence of a once powerful national
party. The one speaker of the evening introduced himself,
not as an expounder of distinctive democratic doctrines, but
as a special pleader in the interest of organized labor, He
candidly admitted that were it not for the sop thrown out in
the democratic platform by the insertion therein of the anti
inj unction plank he would not be addressing them. This
was his strong suit. To strike down the power of the courts
in the issuance of writs of injunction in disputes between
employes and employers was just the sort of milleuium the
ultra wing — the paid agitators — of the labor movement were
praying for. It would place the strike, the boycott, picket
ting, aud kindred discredited methods to the fore in the set
tlement of labor troubles. The trend toward anarchy involved
in this proposition is self-evident. It was remarked by some
of the hearers that the speech would have sounded less dis
cordant if delivered in the hall of a labor organization, in
stead of au appeal for suffrage of American cittzeus for class
legislation of the most dangerous stamp. The significant
feature is the straits to which democracy is reduced iv its
despairing efforts to trap votes. The party seems to be work
ing on the theory that in the labor organizations there ai-e
enough votes to bring enough doubtful states to the demo
cratic fold, provided they can be had fairly solid, and hence
they are bending their energies iv this direction. Gompers
in the east and Me Arthur and other paid officers of the
union are out stumping for Bryan, proclaiming doctrines
which are subversive of the very principles of good govern
ment. It is the same spirit that joined hands with populism
and other delusive fads, under which the democracy has been
wasted to its present skeleton form. "Anything to win,'' is
the slogan, directed this year in a frantic effort to muzzle the
courts in labor troubles. This course tends to the disrup
tion of both the labor organizations and the democratic party.
Intelligent workingmen refuse to be dictated to in politics
by officials of their labor unions. On the other hand the
conservative element of democracy cannot approve of the
drift of the party from old-time moorings, toward ultra radi
calism. The sacrifice of principle for expediency is rarely
a winning game. As for the masses of independent voters
who train with no party, they are apt to take no chances with
the heresies of Br3'an. They will prefer republican rule,
and a continuance of prosperity which that party's suprem
acy has never failed to insure for the American people.
The city trustees at their meeting held last evening, by a
unanimous vote,passed an ordinance raising the liquor license
within the city limits from $15 to $30 per quarter. The
liquor men opposed the increased, employing A. Camiuetti
as before to look after their side. It was evident from the in
troduction of the new ordinance following so closely on the
defeat of the previous measure, that the board was resolved
to put a heavier toll on this traffic. The only departure from
the original intention was in making the increased license
go into effect in February, 1909, instead of November next,
giving the saloonmen three month's grace to prepare for the
new deal.

SERVANTS' SIGN LANGUAGE.
Peculiarities of Employers and Tour-
lit* Noted by Marks,
Servants and hotel porters in many
cities of Europe have n sign language
as complete an that of the American
tramp.
"It is not generally known," said a
courier, "that servants are In tne hnbit
of giving useful tips to their succes
sors and to tlio man who delivers the
groceries and meat by marks on the
back entrance. In most of the big
Paris fiats and npartments, such an
Americans like to take for the season,
the back door Is literally covered with
barely perceptible signs which nobody
but tho initiated can understand.
"A freshly engaged domestic knows
exactly what to expect, whether bis
masters are easy or hard to please,
whether It Is 'monsieur' or 'madame'
who Is hard to get along with. Other
signs tell whether the food is good or
bad, whether the work is difficult or
not, otc.
"Tho boy from the grocer's or the
baker's or tho butcher's will also be
informed whether he can expect a big
tip or not.
"The system is even more developed
among hotel servants. A family arriv
ing from Italy, after having refused to
give what somo Italian porter consid
ered a sufficient tip, will have the fact
advertised In every hotel he visits in
Switzerland or Franco. A little mark
on the trunk is all that is needed."—

AMERICAN FRENCH.
The Struggles of a New Yorker In a
Paris Ros';aurant.
He gnzed coniplacicitly at the gay
labels on his trunks. "Funny bow you
boar In Paris"— so he continued his
reminiscences of travel— "our thin
American accent struggling with the
sonorous French tongue. You hear
queer mistakes, too— uo end of 'cm.
The queerest I came across was made
by a New York man.
"This tourist at the Chatham wanted
to say, 'I am hungry.' He should have
said, 'J'ai falm. 1 Then the waiter
would ■ have brought him a meal at
once. What he did say was:
"Me suls fameux. garcon.' He said
there, 'I'm famous, waiter.' And the
waiter, impressed, bowed and smiled.
'Congratulations, sir.'
"No food came. Ho must have made
an error, so he tried again:
" 'Garcon, J'ai une femme.' That
meant he had a wife. The waiter said
ho was sure she was a' winner.
"Rather red now, he took a third
dive:
"'Je suis femme.' This time the
Now Yorker said he was a woman.
" 'And madam dresses hi this way
for comfort's sake?' the waiter in
quired, with a gallant smile.— New
York Press.-
"Chuck It, Duke!"
While the Duke of Connaught was
in Cairo he went for a stroll one morn
ing, and on his way back to his quar
ters he came face to face with an old
Englishman wearing the ribbon of the
Indian mutiny on his breast. The
duke stopped and spoke to tbe man
about his military service for some
little time. Presently tbo man said,
not knowing, of course, to whom he
was speaking, "Are you in the army
yourself, then, sir?" Tho duke smiled
and admitted that he was. "Getting
on all right?" was tho next question.
The duke smiled again and said that
he had not very much to grumble at,
on the whole, though perhaps he was
not doing quite so well as he could
wish. "No, and you never will, my
boy," was the surprising retort of tho
veteran. "What you want In the army
today is either brains or a tremendous
amount of Influence behind you. You
may take my tip, old chap, and chuck
It:"— London T. P. O.
Fencing With Umbrellas.
Recently a French publication print
ed a picture of some American girls
fencing with umbrellas and stated that
they were trying to acquire thus the
necessary skill and assurance to parry,
with a simple gesture, an attack of
Apaches.
It also stated that this sport was not
born in America; that lor several years
In France a noted fencing mistress.
Mine. Guillemot, at the same time that
she taught fencing with the sword for
byglenle reasons and for personal de
fense, also taught her pupils to "play"
with the umbrella.
The article finishes by saying that It
Is certainly "piquant" that thia modern
application of an ancient sport was
taught by a Parlslenno long before
America claimed the original idea.

The Lost Town of Indiana.
I''nr more than three-quarters of a
century Salisbury Ind., has bceii a
lout town.
Where once was a flourishing city
In embryo in Wayne county, not a
vestige of litunim habitation remains.
Usually, when a town retrogrades,
tbeie is at least a remnant of its pros
perity lot't. Not so, with Salisbury.
Not a building stands to show tbat
troni 1810 to 1820 it was a prosperous
community, which bad evolved from
framo to brick buildings, and which
had aspirations of becoming a inland
metropolis. Only a crock and a
country road remain of what wav
once Salisbury.
When Salisbury ceased to be the
county seat it went into a rapid de
cline. Conturvillu robbed Salisbury
of its birthright. And horn 1820,
when tbo brick courthouse became
useless, Salisbury rapidly succumbed
to the blow.
In six years there were hnrdly a
dozen families left. Then silently
one by one, they too, stole away.
Salisbury expired without a gasp,
and the rest of the thriving world
knew not tbat it had gone.
As the years went by Cencervilie
lost her honors also. Richmond
became the county seat. But that
didn't help Salisbury. Nothing re
mained of tbat ill-fated burg but a
low buildings. And gradually even
they succumbed to tbo general de
cline Ono by one they rotted or
were carted away. Not even a shed
remained to mark the poor town's
site. Salisbury was oil' tnu map.
All that is now left of Salisbury is
a legend. A pretty legend it is,
though; ono that goes for beyond tbe
modern bustle and thrift that brushed
Salisbury oil' tbo map.
At tbe beginning ot tbe nineteenth
century, so the tradition runs, a band
of pioneers came upon two Indian
lovers at their trystinc-place. L.ike
tbe told young brave that he was,
tbe redskin valiantly det'emlod lnm
self and bis sweetheart from capture,
and in tbo struggle both were killed
and went to tho happy bunting
grounds together. ,
After tbe struggle the pioneers bo
came charmed with the beauty of Ibe
spot. They decided to settle there
and Salisbury was born.
JSut it was a luckless birth, attend
ed, so tbe legend runs, by the curso
of the red maiden's old mother, who
declared tbat tbo town would not
live, hut would disappear from tbe
face ot tbe earth.
It was tbe first; settlement in Wayne
county. Aud among its noted sons
was Oliver P. .Moiton, the war gover
nor of Indiana. Jiut, though fortune
seomed to smile at first, it soon begnn
to frown, and now Salisbury is but a
memory.
