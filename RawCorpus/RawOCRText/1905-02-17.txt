Why Leaves Turn Broirn.
The greeu matter in the tissues of a
leaf is composed of two colors, red and
blue. When the. sap ceases to flow in
tbe autumn the natural growth of the
tree Is retarded, and oxidatiou of the
tissues takes place. Under certain con
ditions the green of the leaf changes to
rod. Under different aspects it takes
oil a yellow or brown hue. The differ
ence in color is due to the difference in
combinations of the original constitu
ents of the green tissues and to the
varying condition of climate, exposure
and soil. Maples aud oaks have the
brightest color.

The Change of n Name.
How family names change In the
course of many years is illustrated by
the conversion of "Botevile" into
''Thynne." An English deed bearing
date in the closing days of the fifteenth
century shows three brothers then
nourishing— John Botevile of Botevile
and Thomas and William Botevile.
Tho trio are distinguished from all oth
er Boteviles by the explanation "of the
Inne," or family residence, the title to
which had come to their joint posses
sion. John's grandson was known as
Ralph Botevile-of-the-Inne, from 'which
the transition to Ralph Thynne Is easy.
His descendants have been Thynnes
ever since.

"Then why study it?"

"Well, I've just been looking over the

that if I study hard from now until
the lease expires I'll have a glimmer

have to sign another. What the agent

MARRIAGE IN MEXICO.
Bow tbe Gngiigemnit and Wedding
Arv Celebrated.
The Mexican people are hospitable to
a fault, always welcoming their friends
even though they have not enough to
*at themselves. And they religiously
visit the sick, including those who
have contagious diseases. They are nl
so addicted to public social functions,
the invariable mode of entertainment
being the dnnce. They are fond of mu
sic, .though not proficient in the art of
making it, probably more from lack of
opportunity than from lack' of capac
ity.'. The violin and guitar are the usual
instruments of music, the repertory of
the local musicians being usually lim
ited to a few tunes which are in equal
demand for the dance and for the fu
neral.
One of the most interesting and beau
tiful of the social functions is the pren
dorio.' When a young man wishes to
rr.u^-y he asks for the girl of his choice
of the parents, not of the girl herself,
and if she is given the prendorio at
once follows, ushered in by shooting
nnd, demousf rations of joy. The bride
and* bridegroom are publicly presented
to their future parents-in-law, after
whjch the company pass in procession
In front of the couple, each one drop
plug a piece of money into the hands
of the bride. Then follows the inevita
ble dance. This public betrothal is con
sidered almost as binding as marriage,
and I have heard of but one instance
In which the compact was not kept, the
recreant bridegroom in that case being
visited with ostracism. The betrothal
is usually followed by marriage just as
soon as the services of the priest can
be secured. The marriage ceremony is
followed by a feast more notable for
the abundance of things to drink than
for things to eat and by the usinil
dance. Indeed the festivities are often
prolonged for several nights after the
wedding.— Southern Workman.
THE AGE OF STARS.
Color. Aids the Astronomer In Mak-
ing HU Calculation*.
As a star contracts from the sur
rounding nebulous matter from which
it was thrown off its temperature rises,
and with this augmented heat occurs &
change both in the star's spectrum and
color. Redhot iron Is not nearly so hot
as white hot iron. By observing the va
rious changes in tint which the metal
undergoes the foundryuian is able to
tell with considerable accuracy its de
gree of heat. A somewhat similar
method of -gauging a star's temperature,
and therefore its age, is relied upon by
the astronomer. Color, then, and spec
troscopic analysis enable the astrono
mer to estimate the age of orbs that
are only beginning to exist as stars
and others whose light is fast fading.
After having coagulated, as it were,
from a nebulous mass, a star assumes
a color that may be best described as
an intense bluish white, much like that
of the electric arc. Stars of that hue
are, therefore, in their infancy. Then
comes the white stage, followed by the
yellow, orange and red, each succeed
ing hue indicating greater celestial an
tiquity than the last. Up to the yellow
period the star as it contracts grows
hotter and hotter. Then a gradual cool-
Ing takes place. Accompanying the
changes in color are changes in the
spectrum of the star— changes that In
dicate a modification in physical struc
ture. In tbe bluish white period of a
star's infancy the characteristic wide
lines of hydrogen gas predominate in
the spectrum. As the color changes,
the lines of eqleium, magnesium and
iron appear, the hydrogen lines gradu
ally becoming thinner and those of
calcium broader. — Booklovers Maga

Influence of Salnte-Bcnve.
Sainte-Beuve is the foremost literary
critic of the nineteenth century in the
Influence he has exerted upon his fel
lows. In a very real sense Matthew
Arnold in England and Tame in
France are his disciples, or at least he
Is their literary ancestor. They de
rive from him, and the doctrines they
have niade explicit are often implicit
in him. The part of Talne's critical
theory which has withstood the test of
time is that which Tame acquired from
Sainte-Beuve, and not a few of the
points which Arnold pressed insist
ently on the attention of all who read
English he took over from his French
predecessor. There are no real critics
of literature of our time, from Mr.
Janies in America to M. Brunetiere in
France, who have not cqme under his
spell at some period of their own de
velopment and who have not sharpened
their own vision by a more or less de
liberate application of tho methods
of Sainte-Beuve.— Brander Matthews in
Century.
Unit or Tuo-ti'ilnln.
The bishop of Kensington at a prize
distribution recently told of a case In
Which a boy got the better of the ex
aminer. "Suppose," asked the exam
iner, "I offered you half an oranjre arjcj
two-thirds of an orange, which ptec^
you take?" 'Tlease, sir, the
half." shouted the lad. "Stupid boy!"
exclaimed the examiner. "I shall put
a black mark against you for that,"
Subsequently a deputation of scholars
waited on the examiner to convince him
that he was wrong. "Why am I
wrong?" he inquired. "Because Tom
my does not like oranges at all," was
the conclusive answer.— St. James' Ga

FAMOUS ENGLISH WELLS.
Some Whose Water* Are Churned
■\Vlth Magic or Miraculous Power.
Though there are hundreds of wells
supposed to possess magical " powei
scattered all over England, the general
public is ignorant of their locality oi
the romantic stories connected with
eacli one. There may be a possible ex
ception in the well of St. Keyne, irj
Cornwall, for'Southey has made It fa
mous in a witty little poem The mag
ic of its waters Is such that the hus
band or wife who. drinks first from ii
after leaving the altar will have the
upper hand over the mate for their
joint lives. The bride of whom Southey
tells uh did not wait till after the mar
riage ceremony to pity a visit to the
well, but took the precaution of taking
abottle with her to the church.
Another well, in Monmouthshire,
which has a peculiar fascination for
the unmarried- maidens is known is
the "virtuous well." For generations
the maidens of that locality have ac
credited it with marvelous powers in
forecasting their futures. They have
only to drop a pebble into Its water
and count the resultant bubbles, for
each bubble represent? a month of
waiting for the day which will make
them brides. In order to propitiate
the genius which presides over the well
It is necessary to decorate the bram
bles which shade it with bits of white
cloth.
Then there are the so called holy
wells which have many medicinal vir
tues. Such a one is St. Winifred's, at
Ilolywell, which is accredited with
cures that are almost miraculous. The
legend of its origin is a very pretty
one. It is said that twelve centuries
ago St. Winifred, the winsome daugh
ter of a Welsh chief, was wooed by
Prince Caradoc, a prince of ill repute.
She declined his persistent advances,
and at last he killed her in a fit of
rage. From the spot on which St.
Winifred's lifeblood fell there gushed
forth a stream of crystal water which
has worked miracles in her name for
so many centuries.
Practically all the ills to which the
flesh is heir can be cured by one or an
other of these wells. St. Nlnan's, In
Cornwall, is said to restore lunatics to
sanity, but the patient must be Im
mersed in the water and held there un
til the breath has nearly left his body.
This seems a heroic measure. But even
this is not so severe as the treatment
which must be endured if a madman is
to be cured at Llaudegla well, in
Wales, for after the victim is nearly
drowned he is trussed like a fowl and
laid under the communion table of the
neighboring church for 1 the night.

Copuright, 1901,, by Ethel Harrington
Deep in the heart of each man and
fc-oman lies some unfulfilled ambition
toward which his efforts tend as a
goal. With Myra Darling It was a
gold watch. * •
Her days were passed behind a
counter where a variety of neckwear
was displayed. The remuneration was
small and served only to provide her
with a "home" and the simplest of
gowns. The watch for which her soul
hungered might have been the moon
or the Roc's egg. But more, trying
than the privations she endured was
the cheapness, the narrownesa of her
life, so different from the gentle sur
roundings of her girlhood.
It was her birthday, her eighteenth
year, and Sunday— a dry free from the
aisle walker's espionage, a happy com
bination which Myra enjoyed to the
full. A long afternoon In the crisp,
cool air of the park was a happy cli
max.
It was turning dusk as she left the
park. The city lamps already shone in
a long line down the avenue. On the
side streets the shadows fell black
and ugly, causing a few buildings to
stand out in bold relief. Suddenly a
flash from a passing automobile struck
a small, round object that glittered
near the curbing. Myra bent over to
pick Hup. Had some beneficent tairy
godmother thrown the gift at her feet?
It was a watch, and on, her birthday!
She seized It rapturously and, looking
neither to the right nor left, fled up
the steps of her boarding house, never
pausing until she stood In the hall room
she called her home. She lighted the
gas and drew down the shaire, then
breathlessly examined her new found
treasure. The small hunting case was
of gold, with no mark to identify it,
and set in diamonds.
"You little beauty," whispered the
girl as she caressed it with her fingers.
Then, with woman's curiosity, she tried
to open the back. It was difficult, but
at last Myra gasped with surprise. The
face of a young man, with honest eyes
and kindly mouth, looked into her own.
"I wonder if he owns the watch?"
she thought. "Xo, it's a woman's trin-
TOM HAD PRESENTED MTRA VH'HH A GOLD
■WATCH,
kct. He must have given it to the
girl—and if so he"—
Myra abruptly closed the case. But
she could not shut out the face from
ber mental vision.
She passed her evening rocking slow
ly in her chair, ■with a magazine be
tween her fingers, the gentle ticking of
the watch counting the passing hours.
That night she dreamed not of the
watch, but of a life which the watch
typified, and through the dream stalked
a man who.se face was the face in the
watch.
She awoke a little after G to revel
in the delight of knowing the exact
hour and turning luxuriously over for
another fifteen minutes.
All day she thought about her won
derful acquisition and smiled happily
to herself. The other girls noticed it
and twitted her in their good natured
if rather coarse way.; Slyra laughed,
but guarded her secret and hurried
home to pass another evening of tle
lightful possession. Three days passed,
and, though the watch itself was :\
never failing source of delight, as the
actual realization of her dreams It was
the picture that crept into her heart.
She told her secrets to those honest
eyes and called him "dear friend." lie
seemed somehow to understand her
every whim.
"The whole world could trust you,
and— l'd trust you absolutely," she told
him one night very softly. "The otlier
girl trusts you too? The other girl!
How sorry she must be to lose your
picture!"
Then suddenly, without any warning,
Myra awoke to the truth. The watch,
the picture, were not hers! She had no
right to keep them. She turned to the
window and looked drearily out over
-the roofs of houses.
"I never thought of it, not once.
They're not mine. They are hers. Hers,
and I kept them, it's the same as
stealing. 1 never thought."
•I'btit "iioou she spent half an hour
nflining over newspaper A\ea in tho
library. She fotynd thp description la
the "Lost and Found" column anil
made note of ' f he " address with eyea
grown misty.
She put oft! the evil day until Sunday
and decided^ to enjoy to the full her
last day of the fairy gift which was to
vanish 60 soon. She slipped a narrow
blaijk ribbon on the. watch and reck
lessly wore it all day. She did not
dare to look at It or exhibit it to the
girls, but the knowledge that it was
ticking steadily in her belt brought
;omfort.
"Can I see the lady— the one who
lost her \vatchjr"' she aafred. nnd_she

was at once snown into' a room wnn
luxurious appointments. There was a
log fire in the grate, with comfortable
lounging chairs and books hi every
available space. It carried Myra back
to those other days now dim in her
memory.
"You have found my watch? How
glad I am!" The speaker came close
to Myra, with outstretched hands and
eager smile. She was as beautiful as
any of the women whom Myra served
during business hours.
The girl laid the watch In the other's
hand. Surely with all Miss Shepherd
possessed she could have spared this
toy, but It was hers, and she must have
it
"It was my mother's," . said Miss
Shepherd softly. "That is why I can
not thank you enough. And you will
accept this little acknowledgment?"
she said, trying to press a roll of bills
into Myra's clenched hand.
"No," "said Myra. "It's yours. L* I .
want nothing."
"But I promised a liberal reward." i
"And I had it— all the week. The
watch was such good company." She
did not mention the picture.
And to all Miss Shepherd's argu
ments and entreaties Myra reiterated
"No." The picture held her firm. She
could not take the money for that.
In the end she allowed herself to
be persuaded to remain until the rain
ceased and to drink a cup of tea.
• "Here's Tom. You must meet him!"
exclaimed her hostess proudly as the
door swung open and there entered the
original of the photograph.
One look from Myra, and then her
lashes drooped in embarrassment The
others discussed the watch and its re
covery. At first Myra could scarcely
follow what they said, but they were
so kind, so full of interest about her
and her little . experiences, that she
soon found herself chatting freely and
laughing at Tom's funny sayings; still
she rose hi trepidation to find how
late it had become.
Tom (she had not discovered his oth
er name) insisted that as his automo
bile was at the door he would take her .
home, i
"Oh, no!" gasped Myra in distress,
turning to her hostess. "I'd rather
take a car."
"Don't you like motors?" questioned
Miss Shepherd kindly.
"I've— l've never tried one," admit
ted Myra.
"Then that settles it," exclaimed
Tom, and Myra found herself hurried
to the door, with Miss Shepherd exact
ing a promise that she would come
again.
"Yes, do!" urged Tom as they'went
down the steps. "She really means it
Isn't she jolly?"
"She's very kind. How happy she
must be— so pretty and such a beauti
ful home, and— and you"—
Myra had not meant to say that at
all. It just slipped out.
"You bet. She's the best sister that
ever a fellow had." .
"Your sister?" stammered Myra, and
somehow in her surprise she nearly
missed the step of the motor car, but
Tom caught her.
"Of course. What else did you
think?"
Myra felt her face flush hotly. She
trembled a little, but she did not say
just what she thought. In fact, Bhe
did not tell him until the following
Christmas. Tom had presented Myra
with what had once been the desire of
her heart, a gold watch.
"I can't take anything 8o hand
some," she had said, shaking her head
earnestly.
Tom only laughed. The case flew
back, and there was the one face in all
the world for Myra. ' : ; V
"Sweetheart, 1 claim a liberal re
ward," said Tom. "Please take me
too."

pers of the tea trading ships.
After the chrysanthemum is potted
leave it for a little time in the shade.
Then give it all the sun that is possible.
The chrysanthemum was introduced
into England 200 years ago from Chi
na. It was grown first in Holland aft
er its emigration.
The chrysanthemum is one of the
easiest of garden flowers to grow, but
it needs careful tending after it is
brought into the house in pots when
the frost comes.

THE SENATORIAL BOODLERS.
• Whatever the result of the pros
ecution of the senatorial quartet —
Bunkers, French, Emmons and
Wright — through the criminal
courts, public opinion has already
pronounced a verdict of guilty. They
have betrayed the trust reposed in
them by a too confiding people; for
the paltry sum of $350 they have
sold themselves, and brought dis
grace upon the state. California
has been hard hit by legislative scan
dals heretofore, but nothing so de
grading has defaced her history as
this latest story of boodle. In the
presence of the facts adduced will
the senate expel the unworthy mem
bers. That is the question. Noone
contends that they should be con
demned unheard. They might have
had their say before the special com
mittee, but not under conditions that
would have precluded their punish
ment through the courts. They
have no cause for complaint that
they were not allowed to meet sworn
testimony against them, by their
own testimony under oath. If they
were able to show, as they claim,
that the whole affair is a conspiracy
to ruin them, the mere refusal to place
them under oath would not have
caused them to remain dumb. They
were figuring to tie the hand of justice
in the courts. They did not succeed.
But the question of expulsion or
whitewash must be passed upon by
the senate before the trial in court
can be had. Let us hope for the
reputation of the state that senators
will manfully face this issue. Let it
not go forth that California, through
its chosen representatives, is in sym
pathy with boodle and boodlers.
Russia is determined to win a vic
tory before quitting. She will listen
to no peace overtures until she has
whipped the Japs ia one stand-up
fight. And if she were lucky enough
to win one battle she would want to
gain another and another, until she
had crushed her valiant foe. The
prospect is slim for a reversal of the
story of misfortune and disaster in
the least degree. She has had such
an unchecked career of conquest for
centuries that it is hard to reconcile
herself to the thought that her pol
icy of expansion must be abandoned.
Like the inveterate gambler, who
stays with the game until his ability
to do so is exhausted, so Russia
hangs on to her dream of world con
quest, until her military arm is para-
Ilyzed by defeat abroad and revolu
tion at home. Japan, is doing noble
service for the world's peace by
soundly thrashing this over-grown
bear, and throwing back her frontier
from Manchuria and the whole Pacific
, coast.

lone vs. the Railroad
[Communicated]
That many of the lone people feel a
little sore over the extending of the
railroad further eastward, no one will
deny. The beautiful little valley city
had been the terminus so long that
many of her citizens had grown to be
lieve that it should always be thus.
Enterprises that were calculated to be
of lasting benefit to the place are now
being characterized as next to worth
less, and the blame is being laid at the
doors of the railroad extension pro
moters, lone is too stable a town to
be materially injured by the railroad
passing beyond her borders. She is
situated at the head of one of the most
fertile valleys in the state, and in close
proximity to another equally as good,
whose products must be marketed with
her business men. Large holdings in
these fruitful valleys must be sub
divided, population increased, now in
dustries fostered, and it will be but a
matter of a few years before the enter
prising portion of the people of lone
will be reaping a benefit from this new
order of things. If we were the owner
of property in lone today, we would
placo just as groat a value upon it as
formerly. The blacksmith may not
have so many horses to shoe, but he
will have more plows to sharpen. The
hotel proprietors may lose a quarter
now and then from a teamster, but
they will take in a dollar occasionally
from the farmer who has brought his
family into town to buy a month's sup
plies. The livery man may miss hiring
his teams to a drummer occasionally at
$2.25 per day, but the improved condi
tion of our public roads will enable him
to get $4.00 por day for tho same team
from one. of the well-to-do young farm
ers in the community, *and so on
throughout every line of business,
lone by koeping her grammar and high
schools on a high piano can and will
become the center of education in the
county. Nothing will induce fond par
onts to locate in a community quicker
than superior oducational " facilities.
Let the people of the valley town look
to nothing but her educational interests
during tho next few years, and every
dwelling that, her wealthy men will
erect can be readily filled with desirable
tenants. On the other hand, neglect
the educational interests and many of
those already there will be driven away.
From our point of view the future of
lone is in the hands of her own people
and not tho railroad. What is for the
best interests of tho many is always, in
the end, beneficial to the few. Let the
road be extended to the extreme east
ern portion of tho county, and the
beneficial results will reach beyond its
westorn borders. z
VOLCANO ITEMS.
Peace, happiness and contentment
reign supreme in our quiet little town.
No grumblers, no knockers, but with
everyone living and willing to let others
live we move quietly on, waiting for
the noise and bustle that is sure to be
ours when the railroad comes, and
when some of our valuable quartz leads
are opened up in proper shape and
made to yield up their hidden treasures.
Grillo Bros, have added a large stock
of goods to those recently purchased
from tho Clute estate, and now have
one of the neatest and best eauipped
stores to be found in any mountain
town. It requires two clerks and a de
livery wagon working early and late to
supply the demands for goods that are
continually pouring in upon them.
Cassinelli Bros, report business better
for this time of tho year than for many
years past. They are the owners of
several quartz claims, and expend quite
a sum each year doing assessment
work. Several of their claims are
showing up well.
T. J. Quinn, our blacksmith, says he
is the busiest man in Amador county.
He has made more wagons and carts
during the last 18 months than any
other one man could make in that time,
and cannot keep one on hand long
enough to exhibit his workmanship.
All agree that T. J. is a wonderful
worker, and the grocery men, butchers,
and baker are willing to wager their
all that he has the biggest appetite
that can be found any where in the state.
Jack Giannini, the town shaver,
closed his doors Sunday at 11:30 a. m.,
and tried to form a combination with
his chair, mug and razors not to do
any work on tho Sabbath day after
that hour. His razors had such a keen
edge for business, however, that Jack
was overruled, and continued to lather
and shave until his pockets contained
30c for his day's work.
This ought to bo a great summer re
sort. The near-by natural scenery is
wonderful, and if properly advertised
the St. George ought to be filled with
tourists from the first of May until the
last of November.
Our school is well attended. Prof.
Davis finds no difficulty in managing
his 45 pupils and giving them proper
instructions in tho nine grades, as re
quired by the course of study.
Sam C. Trayner, of San Francisco,
was here last week, interviewing some
of our prominent mine owners.
Mrs. Clute and daughter Ella expect
to leave for San Francisco in the early
spring, where they will reside per
manently.
The post office -has "been removed
from Grillo Bros. store to the tele
phone office. Miss Mary Delucchi
makes a competent and obliging post
mistress.
Much interesting mining news might
be gathered here at present if one could
take tho time to visit the various claims
now in operation, but thus far we have
been unable to do so. and will reserve
this class of news for some future time.

Seeking Office.
Editor Wood, of the Slitter Creok
Record, is again mentioned for office.
The editor seems to be a standing:candi
date for some public position, and does
not appear to be particular as to place.
This time he is out for the clerkship of
one of the new courts soon to be put
into operation. It is an appointive
office, and if he can show to the gov
ernor by facts and figures that the
Record was instrumental in bringing
about the governor's election two years
ago (before Wood owned it) he may se
cure the appointment. If not, we
would advise the office-seeking editor
to smother his ambitions until the next
county election and take a chance
among his home people. He owns a
paper, and through its columns can an»
nounce himself for any position from
superior judge to pound master, and
"Willie"-like, proceed to annihilate

Adjudged Insane.
W. B. Vandament, of Oleta, was
brought to Jackson Saturday by con
stable Lessley and adjudged insane by
Drs. Gall and Endicott. He was at the
county hospital boing cared for by
superintendent LeMoin until Tuesday,
when he was taken to t # he state institu
tion at Stockton by deputy sheriff Kay.
. This case is peculiar.^ The patient
is 72 years of ago, and his affliction has
been coming on for the past two years,
gradually growing worse. His mania
takes on the form that he imagines
that he is afflicted with microbes, and
all his energies are concentrated upon
trying to free himself from them. He
thinks ho can catch them, tries to dig
them out of his skin, pulls his hair out
under the same impression. He would
pack his bedclothes outside and beat
them day after day under the same de
lusion. Everything to him is infected
with microbes. As a matter of fact he
is cleanly in his habits; the microbes
exist in his imagination; for all that
they are terribly real to him. He thinks
others are afflicted in the same way,
and hence is dangerous, inasmuch as
he is liable to resort to desperate meas
ures to rid others of the imaginary
nuisance. Onco he attempted to set
fire to a lady in order to destroy the
microbes. On other subjects he is per
fectly sane. When the witnesses de
tailed his actions hetold the judge that
they were perfectly correct in their
statements. The doctors hold out little
hope of his restoration to a normal
condition.
Fined SSO For Refusing to Assist an
Officer.
Ignorance of the law sometimes gets
good men into trouble. This was the
case with James Bodlnar of Amador
City last week, when deputy sheriff D.
S. Gray asked him to assist in placing
the handcuffs upon the wrists of a man
under arrest. No one will dony the
fact that Mr. Bodinar is a peaceable,
law-abiding citizen, and would in no
wise violate the laws of his country if
he properly understood them. It is
the duty of every able-bodied male citi
zen to assist a peace officer in the per
formance of his duty if called upon to
do so. This Bodinar flatly refused to
do, and deputy Gray took advantage
of the occasion to give him an import
ant and rather expensive lesson on the
duty of American citizenship. A war
rant was secured for his arrest and he
was taken before justice Rose, where
ho plead guilty and was fined $50, which
he promptly paid, feeling that a know
ledge of the law sometimes comes high,
but it is worth tho knowing at any
price.

The Staples Case.
No word has been received direct
from Sheriff Norman as to when he is
likely to reach Jackson with his prison
ers, Dr. Staples and Mrs. Hosie, who
were arrested in Lower California on a
charge of murder, in taking the life of
Mrs. Dr. Staples at Amador City last
August by means of arsenical poison
ing. The sheriff left for Ensenada over
two weeks ago with extradition papers
for the accused pair. From the chief
of police of San Diego, deputy sheriff
Kay has received word that Sheriff
Norman with his two prisoners was
expected to arrive in that city by
steamer from Ensenada on Wednesday
last; that they had been detained in
Ensonada on account of tho rough
water preventing landing, whether of
passongors or freight was not said.
From San Diego tho trip will be made
by rail. Being alone in charge of the
prisoners, the sheriff may havo to re
main in San Diego one night in order
to gain needed sleep. Allowing for
this, ho may be looked for in Jackson
to-night or to-morrow. Much interest
is manifested ia tho arrival of these
prisoners. Last Saturday a crowd of
50 to 100 persons were at the lone depot
in anticipation of catching a glimpse of
the eloping couple, upon whom tho ter
rible charge of a revolting murder la
resting.
Later — A telegram was received by
Deputy Kay last night from Sheriff
Norman, dated from San Diego, stating
that ho would not be home for ten or
twelve days; that a letter of explana
tion would follow. This letter is ex
pected here to-night. What has caused
the delay is not stated, nor whether or
not the prisoners aro with him. All
sorts of rumors aro afloat to explain
the delay. It may bo that a hitch has
occurred with tho Mexican authoritios,
and that the defendants will not be
surrendered except on extradition
papers in legal form.

John Werly Set Free for Attacking Clough.
A dispatch from Oakland dated Feb.
14th says: A jury decided to-day that
it was no crime for John Werly to at
tack Fred R. Clough with a pickhandle
one night last November when he found
Clough in the company of Mrs, Werly.
It was a murderous .looking weapon
Werly used, but Clough, it was ex
plained, was a much bigger man.
Though Werly did not want to kill
Clough, he wanted to inflict sufficient
injury to impi i.cm : i:o idea of a vigorous
protest. ' After committing the assault
he was arrested on complaint of Clough,
who charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. The jury was not out
more than long enough to cast ono bal
lot. There were no dissenting voices.
The testimony showed that Woriy,
who is a middle aged man, had been
made miserable by the attentions paid
his wife. He followed the couplo down
town on the night of November 12, and
waited outside while they had supper
in a Ninth street restaurant. While
waiting Policeman Morrison came
along his beat, and seeing Werly in a
doorway asked him what he was doing.
Werly thereupon told him his story
and asked Morrison what he would do
in tho circumstances, especially if the
man were bigger than he. Morrison's
reply was, "1 would whittle him down
to my size and then go for him."
Werly followed the "cop's" advice in
his own way.
The parties to this affair are all well
known in the neighborhood of Pine
Grove, in which region their early
years were passed.

The lone road between Dufrone's
station and lone is in such a terrible
cut up condition that the passenger
stage and baggage wagon make a detour
tothe right after leaving Dufrene's,
and travel over tho old road, which
has been abandoned for years. This
route necessitates the opening and clos
ing of half a dozen gates. In spite of
this drawback it is found that better
time can bo made, with less strain upon
the horses than by the regular traveled
road. Freight teams of course have to
continue to travel the public highway,
tho condition of which, especially (rom
Mountain Springs to lone, is somothing
awful. It is feared that heavy rains
for the balance of the winter will ren
der it impassablo for heavy teams.*
Light teams are now going by way" of
Buona Vista and Stony crook road, in
order to avoid tho fearful strains upon
horsellesh in going by the regular rpad.
Tho distance is several mjlos greater,
but the trip between Jackson and lone

BLEW HIS HEAD OFF.
Thomas Blatzer Commits Suicide in Jack
son Valley by Shooting Himself. •- ;■
The body of Thomas Blatzer was
found dead in his cabin on the ranch
of Geo. Yager in Jackson valley under
circumstances which indicated suicide.
It is thought the act of self-destruction
was committed on Sunday, as the
neighbors bad not seen him around
since Saturday last. Deceased was a
young man about 28 years of age, and
for the past year had been employed in
cutting wood on the Yager place near
Buena Vista. He lived alone, and from
what transpired at tho inquest gave
not the slightest hint by word or dis
position that the idea of suicide pos
sessed him. Geo. Yager and a helper
went to the ranch Tuesday morning
for the purpose of catching up some
stock. Yager repaired to the dwelling
of Blatzer for the purposo of getting a
piece of rope. There he found Blatzer
lying on the floor dead, the top of his
head blown off by the discharge of a
shotgun., A double-barreled shotgun
lay by his side, one barrel of which was
empty, the other loaded. A stick had
been tied to the trigger in such a way
that the weapon might be discharged
by foot pressure. The charge had evi
dently.' struck the victim about the
bridge of the nose, shattering the
skull and spattering brain matter about
the walls of the cabin. No cause can
be assigned for the deed." Yager said
no trouble had occurred between them.
A note or memorandum,' supposed to
have been written by deceased, was
found. It bore neither signature nor
date. It was written in German. There
were but a few words, which were in
terpreted to mean: "You have got
my meat, now you can have my hide."
No pne was abje to. throw any light on
this note, and it was all that was found
to convey the idea that the victim was
brooding over' something. Coroner G.
M. Huberty held an inquest on 'Tues
day, the jury finding a verdict of sui
cide. Deceased was a stranger, with
out relatives so, far as known in the
state. He was not known to have re
ceived any letters by mail. The re
mains were brought to Jackson and
interred at the county's expense,
. Our Gamp Opra correspondent gives
the following additional particulars:
The dead body was lying on some
barley sacks spread on the floor, the
head resting on a sack of salt. ; His
hands grasped a gun barrel. The whole
upper right side of his head was blown
off, his brains were spattered all over
the. wall, and a great pool of blood had
formed beside h.ln». 'The gun rested
across his body. Hiß legs were stretched
out straight, so it is supposed that Lo
placed his knees against a stick which
he had whittled to fit against the trig
ger, and holding the muzzle against
his eye socket straightened out his legs
and so discharged the gun. Qnly last
week the unfortunate man told one of
the neighbors that in the spring he was
going back to the old country to visit
his aged father and mother. After the
inquest one man, Roy Healy, remained
with the body over night, holding lone
vigil in that desolate cabin with the
unfortunate man. The suicide was
never known to drink liquor, aqd w*ts
very' industrious during the whole time
he has been here.
The Railroad.
The progress of the railroad for the
past two weeks, although considerable,
hardly justifies the hope that the line
will be in running order to Martell's
within the next month. Track laying
has advanced some distance beyond
Kerr's station, or Ranlett, as the depot
will be named. Freight is being re
ceived as far as this point. Several
cars of freight stood on the track at
the time we passed there Saturday.
The depot building is being erected,
and in a few days everything will be in
good shapo for business to this point.
The heavy filling in the neighborhood
of Cyclone station, where the railroad
will cross the wagon road, still lacks a
good deal of completion. And nothing
has been done in grading on the north
side of the road. However, from
Cyclone to Martell's the grading work
is insignificant.
Struck S4O Bock.
Fred Greisbach and Owen Gillick, of
Volcano, recently bonded a mine of
Cassinelli Bros, in the Pioneer district.
They had barely commenced operations
on the claim when they encountered a
rich ore body. We have not heard full
particulars, but learn that a seam 8
inches wide is easily $40 rock. These
men are good prospectors, and will
make a thorough examination of their
find before they make any hurrah
about it. We only hope that the en
tire ledge matter will develop into $40
rock', run' the entire length flf. the
claim, and go dowq beyond the $)0Q
foot mark.

MINING NEWS.
Gwin.— Immediately following the
report that 50 men were let out at the
Gwin, comes another that- a fabulously
rich strike was mado in the north drift
of tho lower level. If the half that we
hear is true, the mine will soon be able
to make a showing equal to that made
during its palmiest days.
Treadwell. — Some thorough pros
pecting is being done under the super
intendency of a man who has spent a
lifetime in quartz mines. So far the
results are satisfactory, and operations
will continue indefinitely.
A report was received Monday that
the mining outlook at and near the
Defender was most flattering. The
rock at the Defender is looking better
than at any time for months, and
Superintendent Joyce is congratulat
ing himself that he did not sell when
opportunity offered itself some time
The Newman Miles claim is showing
up splendidly. Each day's work shows
the ledge to a better advantage. These
men no doubt have a second Defender.
The Railroad Situation.
■A corps of surveyors, having com
pleted the survey of the route from
Martell's to Sutter Creek aqd^ Amador
City, has been engaged for the past
three days in making a survey of the
line into Jackson. The engineering
difficulties in bringing the road to Jack
son are trifling in comparison with
those connected with the northward
extension. By way of Jackson Gate
the grade is easy. The location pf the
depot is not definitely settled, '" The
talk that it would not come nearer to
town than Bright's field was premature.
It is now claimed that two available
sites are under consideration, either of
which would be satisfactory to the
business interests. There is no desire
here to have the depot located close to
the business center, nor in the midst of
a residence district. A site in the
Eudey field, near the junction pf'tbe
forks of the- Volcano road, is under
consideration. Also at the Ginocchio
lot on the north side of Court street,
which would invplve a portion of the
Barton lot. At either of these places
ample room for depot purposes can be
secured.
H. P. Hoey, who has been identified
with the Clark road from §alt J-ake to
Los Angeles, arrived in Tone "on Tues
day last, to assume charge of the new
road. The opening of the line for pas
senger traffic will rest upon his judg
ment. It is likely that passenger trade
will be delayed until the line is com
pleted to Mountain Springs, which will
be in a few days. They are now put
ting in the two trestles at the bend
from Kerr's to Mountain Springs, aqd
these will take perhaps a week to com
plete, after whlob. track laying' to the
depot site at the latter place will be
speedily completed.
The lone and Eastern Railroad Com
pany have bought the Rabb stage line;
also McCall's traction outfit, horses,
wagons and oil tanks, together with
the hauling contracts for the various
mines. Mr. McCall will have charge
of the freighting from Ranlett to the
mines, in behalf of the railroad com
pany. It is understood that Fred Rabb
will continue to operate the stage lines
at present, or until the railrqad is in
condition to dispense with that mode
of transportation.
Ranlett is now a bustling freighting
point. A score of teams start out from
there with freight every day for Jack
son and other points. It has greatly
relieved the situation, as twice the load
can be hauled from this point with the
same number of animals that have
been heretofore required from lone,
and the trip to the mineral belt can be
made in one half the time.
LATER— A meeting of those repre
senting the 'company was held yester
day afternoon, Superintendent Hoev
being present. The propositions were
discussed and the meeting adjourned.
No question was raised about a bonus
from the people for bringing the road
to Jackson. Before leaving town, how
over, a memorandum was. left with
Wilford Dennis, witli directions to
make known the contents to the towns
folks after tho railroad magnates left
town. Mr. Dennis loft for lone this
morning, so we were unable to see him
personally, but a citizen took a copy of
this document in writing as follows:
Towns of Jackson and Sutter Creek
must each furnish depot site 200x2500
feet and right of way from Oneida
grounds to depot site'; also must pay
$10,000 in cash as soon as line and de
pot and yards are completed, and an
other 810,000 within some reasonable
time therefrom, say one year.
We could not verify by personal
interview this ultimatum to the citizens
of Jackson and Sutter Creek, but we
have no doubt of its correctness. It
has changed the situation materially.
The feeling }s. struuglv expressed in
Jackson at "east, not to "submit to this
hold-up business. If presented in the
form of an investment in the road to
the amount stated, it might be con
sidered, but as a gift to the company
bidding for the trade of Jackson and
vicinity, we have not heard a soul raise
a voice In defense of this big stick
proposition.
A. Marcucci has taken the boot and
shoe repair business in connection with
the Jackson Shoe Store. •Parties hav
ing renair work will find him always
on hand for prompt attention to work
in the rear part of the shoo store.

Moving Element.
For several days past the tramp or
moving eloment of some community
ha? b^een passing through Jackson in
large numbers. Some of these men
have money, and seem to take delight
in getting brim full. Most drinkers
are satisfied when carrying a small load,
but these fellows want to find the gut
ter before they are satisfied. Quite a
few of them are saucy fellows, and are
bent on making trouble. They seem
to bo looking for a few days' free grub
at Norman's boarding house, and are
not satisfied until they get It. If the
peace officers of one town give them
the gOby they raise a more serious
disturbance in the next town," and are
brought back for a short time. It is
expected that this will continue as long
as the construction of tho railroad is
kept up in the county. By passing
these people by without comment or
molestation may save trouble and
expense,
Nothing will please an invalid as well

will be a beauty, and with the blacks
well groomed and Mike up for driver it
will no doubt be the most attractive
outfit that ever passed through

THE AMADOR LEDGER: JACKSQU, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 17, 1905.
BREAKING THE
RECORD
Jeanne Caldwell
....Copyright, 1904, by T. C. McClure....
The man grasped the lever of the
French touring car, and the crimson
demon stopped so suddenly that it
fairly sprang backward. The lane waa
narrow, and the girl who stood directly
in the path of the machine had the im
perious carriage of one who felt she
held the key to the situation. When
the dust had subsided, the man saw
that above the imperious figure rose a
face of singular charm, surrounded by
an aureole of copperish gold. AH this
he saw in a flash despite his leather
visor and ugly goggles.
The girl came to the side of the ma
chine.
"You are Mr. Benedict's chauffeur?"
The man nodded his head and made
a motion as if to raise his cap. The
girl put one foot on the step.
"Yes, I recognized the car. I want
you to take me to Barrington as fast
as you can make the machine go."
The man stirred uneasily.
"But I am meeting some people at
the 11:30 train"—
"That makes no difference," said the
girl, sweeping away his objections with
"wniii xou please thank him fob sib?"
true feminine finality. "I will answer
to Mr. Benedict for your disobeying or
ders. A woman is dying in that cot
tage. To save her life the doctor must
have certain things from his office In
Barrington, and you must take me for
them." \;
Even before she finished the sen
tence he had thrown open the low
door, and she sprang up beside him:
As she settled Into her place the
mighty car swung round in a circle,
and they were off. She unfastened the
veil from her big flat hat, tucked the
latter behind her and tied the tulle
over her hair, which refused, however,
to be confined by such gentle measures.
The man saw all this from the tall of
his eye despite the goggles.
The " road stretched before them,
smooth and level as asphalt pavement.
No teams were in sight.
"Faster!" cried the girl impatiently.
"You can surely make better time than
this!"
"Against the law," said the man curt
ly.
"Very well, break the law. I'll pay
the fine if you are arrested. Oh, don't
you understand? I've never seen any
one die, and we've got to get back in
time to save herl"
The car sprang forward. The girl
closed her eyes suddenly. She had
never ridden so fast
"Accident?" hissed the man's voice
in her ear.
"Yes; 'she fell and cut herself. I waa
driving by in my pony cart when I
heard her groan. It was dreadful. I
bad never seen blood before, you know.
Just then Dr. Herron drove along. He
said something about an artery and
went to making bandages. I—l don't
think I was much good—l turned sd
faint Then he wanted to drive back
to Barrington for some things, and—l
—I was afraid to stay alone with her.
He wrote the list on a paper, and 1
was Just starling with the pony cart
when I heard your machine. The doc
tor says she has just one chance in a
hundred. You were the chance."
The car stopped at the top of the bill.
"Brace yourself," said the man curt
ly. Then came the plunge downward.
It seemed to the girl as if the wheels
did not strike the ground as they
passed through space. When they,
reached the foot of the hill she realized
suddenly that the chauffeur had been
holding her in the car with an arm
firm and unflinching. He did not apol
ogize when he removed Its support.
They were turning into the village.
"Which street?" he demanded. And
she pointed to a white gabled cottage.
He.was evidently a well trained chauf
feur of a multimillionaire bachelor.
He knew enough to keep his place and
not to take advantage of an awkward
situation.
The doctor's wlfo followed her to the
car, talking volubij.
"Now, don't you stay around that
place, fretting your soul out, Miss Carle
ton. The doctor will get some neigh
bor to stay with her."
Tbe car panted up tbe hill.
•Isn't this dreadful?" asked the girl
nervously. "Oh, excuse me; I know
yott are making good time, but it
seems as It we were crawling. That

woman has the dearest baby. She can
oot die and leave the poor little thing
ill alone."
"Did you ever think, Miss — Misa
Carleton," said the man, watching her
curiously, "that the baby might be bet
ter off if the mother died? The wom
an is poor. You or some other rich
woman might adopt the child end give
tt n better home than the mother ever
could."
"No, you don't understand. So many
men say such things because they do
not understand women — and babies.
It isn't the home; it's the love." She
had forgotten that the man beside her
was a servant She was thinking only
of the baby that had cooed confidingly
in her arms while the doctor worked
over its mother. "I've seen it curled
in her arms. If she died, no arm would
encircle it in just the same way. No,
you can't understand, because you are
a man. But I— l've felt always that I
was cheated out of something—some
thing that every other girl I knew had
— a mother. There's a loneliness — I
can't Just tell you what it Is. Some
times it comes in the dark when you
are alone and sometimes when you are
among other people and see other girls
with their mothers. I can't describe
my feeling, but I Just felt as if I must
save the mother to that baby."
The man did not answer, but the ma
chine did. It gave a despairing groan
and shot up the incline in a way .that
would have made Its makers proud.
The touring car stood outside the
humble cottage until the girl came out
again. Her eyes shone like stars.
"We got here in time. She is alive.
I thank you very much. Is Mr. Bene
dict coming home today?"
The man nodded and put a hand on
the lever.
"Will you please thank him for me?—
and I will do so in person when we
"Mr. Benedict, if you are very good
you may take Miss Carleton out to din
ner," said his hostess. "You know she
has developed into a haughty Berkshire
beauty."
"Little Mame Carleton?" he mur
mured. . V-V'
"Yes; only since she is old Charley
Carleton's heiress they spell it with a
•y'— 'Mayme.' "
They crossed the room to where Miss
Carleton was chatting with her host
She extended her hand cordially.
"I am glad to see Mr. Benedict home
again, and' especially glad to have this
early chance to thank him for his tour-
Ing car, which I borrowed so uncere
moniously this afternoon."
"And my chauffeur?"
At sound of his voice Miss Carleton
looked around as if for support, but
host and hostess had drifted away.
"I-I thought"—
"Of course," he said, with a quizzical
laugh, "it has heen five years since last
we met— and then there were the gog
gles." He was looking at her hair. "I
think I like It best tied down with a
veil," he remarked Irrelevantly.
"Please send your carriage away and
let me take you home in my car," he
urged. She hesitated, then gave the
order, and they went back over the
Barrington road.
"We broke the record. right here," he
said gleefully as they slowly climbed
the hill. Then his voice turned serious.
"I like to. break records— and yet here
I've wasted five years away from you,
wandering the world over. I never real
ized until this afternoon why it was
that I was lonesome too. I've been
wanting just you— and I didn't know
it." ■■.;;■;.
And then the big car shot Into the
dun shadows of the narrow lane, and
not even the night birds and the stars
could see the answer he read in her
eyes.
A Difficult Caae to Core.
Once I was assistant to an elderly
doctor in Ontario, who also ran a drug
store. He was as peppery as a cay
enne pod, and from time to time cus
tomers and patients sprang jokes on
him just for the fun of hearing him
growl. On one occasion a well dressed
young fellow called at the shop and
asked the doctor to prescribe for a
breaking out and a rash on his left
arm. The doctor examined the limb
and pronounced It to be a bad case of
eczema. . . • *■' V't
"I suppose, doctor, you can cure itT'
said the patient
"Why, certainly," repliedstbe doctor.
"How long will it take to get well?"
"Oh, I guess about two months."
eald the doctor.
"Quite sure, sir. Is it a bad case?"
"Positively the worst I've seen."
"Then I will leave it with you and
call for It again when cured," solemn
ly said the patient, slowly unfastening
his arm, which was an artificial one
and painted for the occasion.—Pear
son's Weekly.
Klnl the Oldest of Bird*.
In New Zealand is found the kiwi, »
strange bird of the ostrich family. Os
triches have two toes, but the extinct
moas had three toes; so also have the
existing emus, cassowaries and rheas,
Dr South American ostriches. The kiwi,
however, differs from the other stru
thious birds in having four toes. Fur
ther, the kiwi cannot be said to bo
quite ostrlch-llke, for In size it is not
larger than an ordinary barnyard fowL
It has a small head, with a large and
muscular neck and a long slender bill,
with the distinguishing feature that
the nostrils are placed close to its tip.
The legs are short, but the muscles on
the thighs are well developed, and the
feet are strong and powerful and pro
vided with sharp claws. The kiwi is «
bird devoid of any external trace of
wings, and there is no trace of tall vis
ible, while it is covered with long, nar
row hairllke feathers, and on the for»
part of the bead and sides of the face
are straggling hairllke feelers.—Chica

I WAYS OF THE MOOSE
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NOBLEST
OF ALL WILD ANIMALS.
Tlie Lai-Kent of the Deer Family, LIT.
Ing or Extinct— The Alnakiui Bui
Moose nave the Greatest Antler*
The Cow and Her Ungainly Calf.
Now and then In wanderings througt
the mountain and forest one comes up
on a gigantic blackish brown dcci
which by reason of the great length ol
its yellowish gray legs stands highei
than a tall horse. It is clothed ii
coarse, bristly hair, longest on the neci
and shoulders, and it has a rather uglj
overhanging nose which distlnguishei
it at once from all other kinds of deer
From the throat of the male hangs t
long hair covered appendage known as
the "bell," and in the fall and wintei
he has also a pair of widespreading
antlers, very heavy and much flattened
or "plamated." He stalks the forest
through undergrowth and over fallen
trunks like a king of giants, or, ii
alarmed, he speeds away at an amaz
ingly swift swinging trot and with a
crashing which resembles the sound o!
falling trees! Such is the moose, th«
largest of all deer, living or extinct.
The moose is chiefly an animal of the
northern woods, the southern limit ol
its range being the head of Green riv
er, ' Wyoming. It is also found Id
northern Maine, New Brunswick,
southern Canada, Idaho, British Colum
bia, Alberta, Athabasca, Yukon and
Alaska. It is strictly a dweller of the
forest, seldom venturing to treeless
plains. It lives for the most part by
browsing on the leaves, twigs and bark
of trees," particularly young trees. In
order to reach the tops of tall saplings
the moose rears up against them, strad-,
dling them with his long legs and lit
erally riding them down. He is fond
est of birch, hemlock, alder, aspen, wil
low and maple. He also eats mosses
and lichens.
In May the "cow," as the female
moose is called, gives birth to a long
legged, ungainly, tawny colored calf,
to protect which the mother will fight
any woodland creature to the death.
She has no antlers, but she can use
ber great sharp hoofs with the skill of
a prize fighter and has been known to
pound to death a large black bear and
fairly trample his body into the
ground. The calf stays with its moth
er for two or three years, or until he
wanders off to seek a mate for him
self. One day last summer I came sud
denly upon a coyr moose standing knee
deep in a shallow pond, while from
beneath her neck ber grotesque looking
calf peered out at me with eyes wide
open, as if with astonishment I hur
ried home and returned with a camera,
but when I reached the spot they were
gone.
. Like all American deer, the "bull"
moose sheds and renews his antlers
every year. They become full grown,
hard and sharp about the Ist of Octo
ber, the beginning of the breeding sea
son. At thistime of year the bulls are
very savage and not only fight furious
ly among themselves, but are apt to
attack anything or anybody who comes
In their way.
The call of the bull is a long drawn
bawl with several loud grunts at the
end. If there is a cow within hearing
she will answer with a low cry, and
the bull will come forward to meet
her. Hunters often take advantage of
this fact and attract tbe bull by an
Imitation of the call of the cow, exe
cuted on a cone shaped horn made of
birch bark. Lying concealed on the
bank of a lake or stream, they give
out the call, and when the bull comes
Within range they shoot him. But as
this trick Is usually played at night
and as the bull sometimes never gives
any warning of his coming until he Is
almost on the spot the sport is apt to
be dangerous. The bull at such a time
Is in no mood to be trifled with, and
unless the hunter is cool headed and a
good shot the moose Is not only willing
but very able to kill him and a dozen
like him if they happen to be on the
spot
Probably the largest moose of which
there is reliable record was shot by
Carl Rungius, the animnl painter, in
New Brunswick in 1901. This great
beast stood seven feet high at the
shoulders, and the length. of its head
and body together was nine feet seven
Inches. The Alaskan moose have the
largest antlers, and one pair from an
animal shot on the Kenai peninsula
lias a spread of seventy-eight and a
half inches and has thirty-four points.
With the dry skull to which they are
attached these antlers weigh ninety
three and a quarter pounds, a weight
which nothing but an animal of gigan
tic strength could carry at top speed
jver the roughest ground and through
thickly wooded country.
In the winter, when the snow is deep,
the moose, sometimes several families
together, will gather in a certain sec
tion of woodland and be breaking out
paths for themselves over a space of
perhaps several acres from what is
known as a "yard," where, if not dis
turbed, they may stay for weeks to
gether. But the moose is able to travel
(veil at all seasons, and even in deep
jnow his long legs enable him to move
it a pace which astonishes any hunter
ivho tries to run him down on snow
shoes.
A wild, frc% life is the only one on
which a moose can live and thrive. In
taptivlty it is much less nervous than
most deer and is disposed to be gentle
md affectionate. But, as a rule, it will
live but a short time, even though It
jets the same food which it had in its
aative woods. It may apnear to relish
Its food, but it will grow to no great
size and in a short time will probably
|le of inflammation of the stomach.
This is one of the noblest wild ani
mals in the world, and it should he glv
su adequate protection throughout Its
range. — Bangor Commercial.
