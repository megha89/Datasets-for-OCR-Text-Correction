Prospect, San Andreas, March 10, 1000.
Michael Owens, who has long resid
ed near Milton, j has had a varied and
romantic life, but an incident that hap
pened to him this* V«ek,* as related by
the Stockton- Independent,, was prob
ably as interesting as any r> single hap
pening of his 'whole 'life. ;' Forty-four
years. ago he taft ~ his home in Illinois
for Australia; and from that time up
to a few months ago no, single link
bound him to old associations. He had
long been given .up for dead by his
friends and relatives, and .he had evi
dently taken no ' pains to learn any
news of them. ■.:_
After various wanderings he found
himself located at his present home,
and as the years crept upon him there
, came a desire to . know the fate of his
relatives, apparently ko long forgotten.
He accordingly wrote to the Sheriff of
Cook, county, Illinois,* asking for in
formation regarding his brother. He
received a reply that his brother was
dead, but that a son survived him, of
whom he gave tho address. A corres
pondence sprang up about six months
ago between this uncle and nephew
who had never seen each j other, and as
a result the nephew determined to visit
the uncle in his California home. .He
arrived in , Milton this week [ and the
meeting, between the two can be
' imagined better than described.

way he lost ' his ' balance and fell back
ward down into a chute.. He went
down fifty feet, striking a timber in his

at the bottom of the chute. He was
considerably injured in the small of the
back, while '•. he ' sustained numerous

TUOUUMNE COUNTY.
Independent, Sonora, March in, lirno.
The blood-thirsty fiend who so vic
iously slashed Joe BerliV throat with
a razor, Wednesday, morning. of last
"'•week, at Cherokee, wa^ captured "the
following Sunday evening and that
n'ght lodged in the Sonora jail. •,
Ever since - receiving notice of the
I murderous assault. Slim-ill' Prico has
worked indefatigahly on the case, fol
lowing dew after clew,, and resolved to
nail the fugitive at all hazards. He
had men posted at intervals along
every road in; the county, armed with
accurate description of the would-be
assassin. A little time was all that was
necessary, and the hunted man showed
up exactly according to the Sheriff's
calculations.", - . "
At 3 o'clock Sunday afternoon,
Sheriff Price received a telephone raes-
I sage from T.; H. (May of Sugar Pine
, stating that bis man had passed down
the road. The officer at once answered
to come on to Sonora, ' via Yankee Hill,
and if he camo up with the Italian to
keep him in sight. \ Price then saddled
his horse and struck out.- He passed
the Peterson place on Yankee Hill,, and
three miles beyond saw a man walking
rapidly along the ', road toward him.
The fellow wore blue overalls, a course
blue shirt and a cheap^ cloth j summer
hat. As the pedestrian drew near the
Sheriff studied him sufficiently to know
that bis search had ended. When but
a - few feet of space separated them,
Price jumped from bis horse and in a
jiffy had the handcuffs on his prisoner.
The latter tried to feign indignation,
but seeing that he couldn't bluff off and
(knowing that the game was up, said he
would accompany the officer. At first
he denied having cut Bertior ever hav
ing been in Cherokee, but finally con
fessed that Berti had befriended him.
"What did you try to kill him,
for, then asked Price. ' '■ \
"I don't know," was all the reply
the Sicilian would give. - ••-.• -• ' ■
The prisoner said his - true name was
Philip Cavalero; that he was 22 years
of age. He claimed not to know which
direction he had taken after cutting
Berti's throat, as he was a stranger,
but said he avoided all roads until he
reached a cabin in the mountains near
where an old couple lived, and that he
made his headquarters there until -the
the day of bis arrest, at which time he
was heading for Calaveras county, j
The aged couple . he mentioned were
Dwight Wheeler and wife •■■- and ' the
" cabin he bad occupied is ' situated be
tween their place, and ; Long Barn,
about 18 miles east of Sonora. - 1 '
He refuses to ' talk of the attempted
murder and robbery, an elaborate ac-
I count of which appeared in last week's
issue' of 'the 'lndependent, and asserts
that he knows nothing regarding the
whereabouts of his pals.
I After getting the handcuffs safely on
Cavalero, the Sheriff attached a long
rope to them and thus led his prisoner
to Columbia. The remainder of ' the
journey to the county seat jail, was
made in the buck board of Tom May,
who arrived in Columbia in time to
have his rig transformed into a crimi
nal transport with himself as com
mander.

Cars Painted in Ten. Minutes.
A number of American railways now
paint all their cars by machinery, and
the apparatus used is very curious and
interesting. The paint is first mixed
to about the consistency of cream and
then poured into a small steel tank
connected with a' reservoir containing
compressed-air." When the valve is
.opened the* stuff is forced up into a
flexible tube about as big- around as a
man's thumb, and comes "out of a brass
nozzle in the form of a fan spray, thin
as a knife blade. All the operator has
to do is to wave the' nozzle to and fro,
using it exactly' like a brush.- -The
spray at the top is not more than an
inch broad, so if he wants a narrow
stroke he has merely to bring it near,
and. vice versa for a wide one. It is
claimed that the apparatus deposits a
paint film of exactly the same thickness
throughout, which is, of course, im
possible to do ! with | a brush, and that
its work is consequently more durable
and a . better protection from the
weather. Be that as it may, there is
no denying its superior speed. The
rapidity i with which painters using
compressed air work is marvelous.
They stand .on movable platforms,
which are pulled forward' and back
before the cars, and they literally paint
them on the run. The time occupied
for each averages about fifteen minutes
and the men claim that they can even
do an entire car in ton at a pinch. —

TALK OF VICE-PRESIDENTS
Republicans and Democrats
for Second Place.
IRE REPUBLICANS NAME HOT EXCELLENT IEN
Democrats Will Strive for the Vice-
President's Chair and Discuss
.' Probable Candidates.
'It te not beyond reasonahle expecta
tions that both of the nominees for the
second place on the great, party tickets
may be representatives of. the same
State— New York. . The accredited
Administration spokesman, Senator
Hanna, has expressly '■' favored, the
claims ;of : New York ' : in a recent
declaration and Democratic calculation
would naturally oppose a Kepub
lican nominee ; from New ' York with a
rival whose nomination would directly
contest the Republican hold on -this
great "pivotal" Stale through its par
ticular share in the ticket. ' .
It is known, however, that Admiral
Schley is strongly favored ; for a place
on the ticket by .influential Democrats,
and bis prominence in the late war and
alleged persecution by Administration
prejudice are ; counted, upon ■to ; score
heavily for the ticket in Maryland and
in other States to a considerable ex
tent. -Judge Augustus Van Wy.ck,
who ran so close a race to Thead'ore
Roosevelt for the Governorship of New
York, is , also seriously" considered,
though his boom for the Presidential
nomination was apparently still-born."
Hon. John W. Keller, Commissioner
of Charities in New York City, and
President of the Democratic Club, is
being strongly but quietly urged for
the place. ! He is a man known to be
one of the most trusted associates of
Richard Croker. He is a man of such
undeniable ability and wide-ranging
friendships that the active assertion of
his candidacy would . command very
powerful backing. Oliver H. P. Bel
mont, who has lately taken so active a
part in the national politics, is another
prominent figure in the list of possible
nominees. Elliott Dan forth, - chair
man of the Democratic State Commit
tee of New York, Congressman Will
iam Sulzer and Mayor Robert A. Van
Wyck are other New Yorkers ' who
have been included in the list of possi
ble aspirants for the nomination. < :
: In New England,' Hon. George Fred.
Williams,, the present Democratic
leader in Massachusetts, | . would < be
strongly supported for the nomination,
if be was ' disposed to enter the. field
of candidacy, and his known intimacy
with Mr. Bryan would doubtless make
such a' connection peculiarly welcome
on the score of personal relations, but
this consideration will - hardly be
ranged in the balance against the pre
pondent weight of political advantage
in strengthening the ticket in a doubt
ful State. For the same reason, Judge
Henry C. Cald well of Arkansas, an
otherwise strong ; favorite from his
high personal standing . and known
agreement with ' the Federal courts
plank of ' the Chicago platforn, is less
likely to be pushed as a candidate. I
Jn the Republican list of possible
nominees Governor Roosevelt would
unquestionably stand first, if he want
ed the nomination, and there appears to
be a resolute movement on the part of
some of his ardent friends to lift him
into the second place on the ticket, re
gardless of his own wishes and calcula
tions. In New York State, at present,
however, among his friends, the Gov
ernor's determination is generally re
garded as fixed, and he is looked upon
rather as a possible choice for the head
of his party ticket in 1904 and . a cer
tain rumor for re-nomination as gov
ernor than as a man who can be pushed
into a place that he does not want. -
Cornelius N. . Bliss, ex-Secretary of
the Interior, : is regarded as a ' "recep
tive" rather than an active candidate.
The Wimberly faction or the Republi
can party in Louisiana met February
sth at New. Orleans and endorsed Mr.
Bliss' candicacy. The Howell-Herwig
faction held a convention at Alexandria
on February 6th and is understood to
favor the nomination of Governor
Roosevelt or Lieutenant-Governor
Timothy L.- Woodruff of New York.
Hon. Elihu Root, Secretary of War,' is
a man of such exceptional ability and
standing that he would be a formidable
rival to anyone in I the field, if he had
not postively - withdrawn his name
from consideration. General Francis
V. Greene, ex-President of the Barber
Asphalt > Company, and a prominent
figure in the Spanish war, has influential
friends, and Congressman James S.
Sherman, New York; Chairman of the
House Committee on Indian Affairs, is
also spoken of. •' . . . : ".
But none of these New Yorkers men
tioned, outside ' of Governor Roosvelt,
has the present prominence in the cam
paign today- of Lieutenant-Go vernor
Woodruff. He has been, for some
time, an active, ambitious candidate,
relying on his wide-ranging business
connections, personal friendships, and
political associations to secure for him
the practically unanimous support
of his own. State delegation. He is as
sured already at the solid and energetic
backing of the ten delegates of his own
Kings County, and his influence in the
State is such that he would be more
likely than any one else named to se
cure a majority at least, of the State
delegation, if Senator Platt does not
exert his conceded Influence as the Re
publican party leader, against his can
didacy. ■ "
Governor Crane of Massachusetts has
been mentioned as a possible choice.
In the west, ex-Congressman E. O.
Standard, of St. Louis, President of
the National Board of Trade, has been
prominently brought forward and his
candidacy has been very strongly en
dorsed by Hon. Henry C. Payne, Re
publican National Committeeman for
Wisconsin.
Governor James A. Mount, of In
diana, and Governor Leslie M. Shaw,
of lowa, have also been suggested as
strong nominees, and there is some
talk of Senator Cushman A. Davis, of
Minnesota. Hon. Webster Davis, of
Kansas, Assistant Secretary of the In
terior, and ■ Governor Edward Scho
field, of Wisconsin, Attorney -General
John W. Griggs, Governor William A.
Stone, of Pennsylvania, and Senator
Stephen B. Elkins, of West Virginia,
appeared to be the only candidates
thus far presented from the Middle
States outside of New York. All
these are unquestionably strong in
their own states, but Senator Elkins is
the only one thus far whose friends are
making an active canvass in his behalf.
Other candidates, of course, are
likely to enter the field, and second
place on the two tickets is obviously an
open chance, for. as yet,' no one, speak
ing with authority for the Administra
tion of Mr. Bryan, has defined their
preference or rot-shadowed their inten
tion to 1 throw their influence in
favor of any particular candidate. 'i' r .
It is : reported by prominent Popu
list leaders that ' their ; convention will
endorse Mr. Bryan's candidacy, and it
is asserted by some that the convention
will present a candidate for Vice-Presl
dent with the hope that tlnl-ir nominee,
may be acceptable .to the Democratic'
National Convention. It is likely that
these matters will be virtually decided
at the meeting of the- Populist Na
tional Committee at Lincoln. Nebraska,'
on February lUth.

Hardy's Helpful Wife.
Thomas Hardy, author of "Tess of
the d'TJrbervilles," has found In his
wife a literary "helpmeet" n I most as
gifted as himself. Many of his earlier
novels she recopled and dispatched to
the publishers, and there Is no novel
which does not bear some trace of her
literary Judgment Mrs. Hardy keeps
constantly in touch with the literature
of the day, and her husband vows that
she Is an encyclopedia In petticoats.
She is also a clever artist and has
painted many pictures In Illustration
of her husband's novels.
Curing a Pernicious Habit.
The plan of arresting people who

Any one guilty of that offense ought to
be sent either to the Detention Hospi

Senator Bard received his committee assignment last
Monday and, considering the fact that he arrived so late in
the session, he fared remarkably well. To make room for
him Senator Kean withdrew from the Public Lands, Senator
Thurstou from the Railroads, Senator Wetmore from the
Manufacturers'/ Senator Mcßride from the select committee
to investigate the condition of the Potomac water front at
Washington and Senator Foster from the select committee on
woman suffrage. Last Tuesday morning Senator Bard and
Representative K ah n visited the office of the Geological Sur
vey to induce Professor Newell' of the hydrographic bureau
to recommend an appropriation of $20,000 to continue the
work already inaugurated in California by that bureau. Pro
fessor Newell stated that such amount could be advantag
eously used and that if he was . assured the support of Con
gress he would make such recommendation. Later, Senator
Bard and Representative Kahn visited the Agricultural De
partment, where Secretary Wilson informed them that he had
decided to recommend an : appropriation of $50,000 for the
continuation of the work of irrigation in California. Senator
Bard is already deep in his labors for California and his
ability is highly appreciated by the great statesmen at the

..The Second Bi-Ennial Convention of the California
State League of Republican clubs has been officially called to
meet at Los Angeles, Friday, April 27, 1900. The League
' Convention promises to be the largest political gathering ever
called together in California, and its deliberations will be
watched with intense interest by Republicans all over the
Union. Every town in the State should make arrangements
to send delegates, and to this end the Republican Clubs
should work. They should reorganize and recruit their
membership for the larger the club the greater will be the
. number of its representatives, hence the greater influence of
the Republican party. The various transportation lines will
make a low rate of fare for the occasion. A Convention Com
mittee of sixty Republicans have been selected by the several
party organizations to make the necessary arrangements.
.The local committee at Los Angeles assures the visitors of a
warm welcome and will leave nothing ..undone for their com
fort and entertainment. Now is the time to organize local
clubs. Our clubs should not be in a dormant state. Let us,
The Division of Forestry has decided to investigate early
next summer the extreme eastern distribution of the Rocky
Mountain trees." The information will be for the benefit of
tree planters on the western plains, for the success of plant
ing in those regions must largely depend upon introducing
the trees which are naturally adapted to them. Heretofore a
large proportion of the trees planted upon the plains have
••been eastern species, the effort of planters having, been grad
ually to force the eastern species westward. There is reason
to believe that a number of Rocky Mountain trees, accustom
ed to an arid environment, will be apt to succeed better in the
more western plains region than the eastern species. This
is particularly true of trees which grow naturally on lower
elevations and which follow the streams for; some distance to
the plains. The work will be done largely by collaborators
of the Division who are familiar with the region. To each
will be assigned a certain area, in which, following the trees
eastward, he will study their habits of growth in varying
President McKinlEy's trip to New York, to attend the
annual dinner of the Ohio society, from which he returned
March sth, was a pleasant break in a protracted season of
very hard work. Mrs. McKinley accompanied him and both
expressed themselves as having had "a' very enjoyable time.
The congratulations offered the President on afl sides on the
able and timely speech he made at the Ohio dinner were
received With his usual modesty. That speech answers many
of his critics.
Lord Roberts, commander-in-chief of the British troops
in South Africa, succeeded in entering Bloemfontein and rais
ing the British emblem over the Presidency, the late official
residence of President Steyn, who has fled to Kroonstad, last
-Wednesday, March 14th. All England is highly excited
over this triumph, as this movement practically concludes
the first half of thecampaign, with success to the British.
While in caucus last Tuesday the Republican Senators
reached a partial agreement on Porto Rican legislation. Sen
. ator Foraker was compelled to be on the floor the greater part
of the day to answer the interrogations, and laid great stress
upon the effect of the different provisions of the bill. It was
intimated that the bill could be amended if not satisfactory
•and Senators opposed to a tariff on Porto Rican products said
there would not be the least objection to passing the bill.
THE AMADOU LEDGER; JACKSON, jjAJ^IFORyiA, FBIP AY, MARCH 16, 1900.
I The most significant feature of the meeting of the Dem
ocratic National Committee, in Washington, was the power
exercised by Ex-Senator Gorman. It was his influence that
knocked out the plan, fathered by Mr. Bryan, of holding the
democratic convention in advance of the republican conven
tion, and it was also his influence that caused Kansas City to
be chosen for the convention after Milwaukee seemed to have
a cinch. Mr. Gorman's powerful and unexpected influence
in the committee is not relished by the Bryan worshippers.
He has publicly said that he would support Mr. Bryan if he
was nominated, but he has not .said that he will help get him
nominated. Mr. Gorman is one of the slickest and most
slippery politicians in the country, and there is very little
doubt that he will keep Mr. Bryan out of the nomination, if
he can find a way to do it. ,
Secretary Hay will not discuss, the report that this
Government has threatened Germany with a commercial war,
if the Meat bill reported to the Reichstag becomes a law, but
from other sources it is learned that representations by Am
bassador White to the German government, caused 'assur
ances to be given that the features objected to by this govern
ment, will not be in the bill when it becomes *a law. No
uneasiness is felt in Washington. Germany has more to
lose' than we have by tariff war, and will not be likely to
invite one. It is believed that the German Emperor is mere
ly playing a little game of home politics in order to get
support for some of his pet schemes, including a large appro
priation for the increase of his Navy.
Representative Ketcham of New York has presented

The Shaft at the Jumper Mine Down
Twelve Hundred Feet — Good
Ore at the Ribbon Bock.
AMADOR COUNTY.
Gristly Hill— Volcano.
Operations are still, in progress at
this mine and the owners are well
pleased with the results.
Crocker ft Casey— Volcano.
The Crocker & Casey property is be
ing hydraullcked with two giant noz
zles.
Beward— Volcano.
Active operations at the Reward
mine have been suspended. The 10
stamp mill is being used by the Mitchell
Company to crush their rock. -
Modoc— Volcano.
There has been a recent change of
superintendents at the Modoc mine in
Volcano. Work at this mine is pro
gressing satisfactorily, tunneling being
the order.
French— Volcano.
Murphy, Gilllck and Abeau are work
ing the French mine. The tunnel Is In
about one hundred feet in cement
gravel. Their old tunnel caved In and
in order to get at the golden treasure
of mother earth it was deemed neces
sary to make another tunnel. The
proprietors of this claim aredolng well.
Mitchell— Volcano.
The Mitchell mine has been reopened.
The confidence of the operators in this
mine is shown by the late activity on
it. Last week 103 tons of rock were
taken out and crushed in the .Reward
mill. The returns from this rock went
- far beyond the expectations of those
interested and it .has added much to
the importance of the Volcano mining
district.
Gritton— Volcano.
The Gritton mine, owned by Gritton
and Keffer, is fast becoming a "big
thing." The main tunnel, which is
run in free washing gravel, is in about
1000 feet and will be driven farther.
Last week George Gritton and J. A.
Keffer made over one hundred dollars
on this property. Another tunnel run
in cement gravel is in about 500 feet
with excellent prospects of great re
sults. Two men are at work In this
tunnel. Nearly all of the tunnels in
the Volcano mining district are leading
to the old channel.
Peck Property— Volcano.
P. N. Peck, one of Volcano's oldest
residents, has a forty-acre tract of
gravel mining property at China Hill
Gulch, adjoining the Crocker & Casey
mine on the north. Mr. Peck informed
a Ledger representative this' week
that the property was rich, but owing
to the scarcity of water, it has been im
possible to work it. He has built a
reservoir near by which is supplied
from a spring, but even that is in
sufficient. Crocker & Casey have
promised to convey the water they use
over Mr. Peck's property and thus
give him a much needed. factor in bis
mining facilities.
Peerless— Jrckson.
At the Peerless mine sinking is the
order and the shaft is now down 140
feet. The good prospects continue.
South Eureka— Sutter Creek.
Wednesday afternoon the mill at the
South Eureka mine, which, since the
destruction of the Standard Electric
Company's power-plant on the* Mo
kelumne river from which the mill re
ceived its power, has been idle, was
started by water power. The hoisting
machinery is being operated with
steam. -
Freemont Consolidated— Amador.
At the Freemont ' mine the three
compartment shaft is being sunk, and
is now down 200 feet. In a short time
the old Gover shaft will be reopened
and worked. The rock is filled with a
high grade sulphurets.
Keystone— Amador.
. ■ At the -Keystone mine in Amador
City everything works smoothly and
satisfactorily. It Is understood that
the rich ledge that was struck some
time ago is being worked a little at a
time and mixed with the low grade
rock before being milled. '
Bunker Hill— Amador.
The Bunker Hill mine is still a cen
ter of interest to local mining parties
and all who are connected therewith
are confident of good returns from this
"old-timer." Superintendent Downs
installed a large steam pump last week
weighing about thirty tons. The shaft
will soon be unwatered and after the
most dangerous places are made safe
and the workings put in good condi
tion, prospecting will begin. Without
doubt good prospects will be found and
within a year the Bunker Hill property
will have a large mill which will be fur-
nished with as high grade rock as can
be found in any of our Mother Lode
gold producers. Success to the under
taking.
Amador Queen, No. 2— Jackson.
Superintendent John R. Phillips of
the Amador Queen mine, No. 2, is well
pleased with the present prospects.
The 'shaft is being sunk from twelve
to fifteen feet a week with four. men on
a shaft. The shaft is now down 1100
feet. Over fifty feet has been sunk by
the contractors, who will sink nearly
130 feet more, the contract being let
for 180 feet. After this is sunk it is
not definitely known what will be the
order.
CALAVERAS COUNTY.
Prospect: Last Sunday as W, A.
Koch of the Ro3e Hill placer mine, near
El Dorado, wa* standing n^ar the tall
race of the mint-, his attention was at
tracted lo a peculiar piew of rock being
washed ilown tho race. He made a
grab for the rock, and was ' rather sur
prised at his find. The piece pioved to
be almost entirely gold, and was found
to weigh five ounces, of which at least
three ounces are believed to be gold.
The man was lucky to see it as he did
for in another moment It would have
been hopelessly buried in the debris.
Hon. Frank E. Dunlap, of Stockton,
president of the Oriole Mining Com
pany, has been in Angels for the past
week, making arrangements for the
extensive working of the mine.'. A
ten-stamp mill has been ordered and
will be put up at once, and the main
shaft will be sunk fifty feet further,
making 500 feet In all. There is now
on the mine a gallows frame with all
the necessary machinery for sinking
1000 feet. '
The St. Lawrence is still pumping
water, and will have the mine clear in
a short time. By the time the water is
out the mill will be ready for operation
and work of taking out ore will be vig
ously pushed.
At the Jones mine they are taking
out good rock tfcat will pay well for
crushing. The outlook for this mine
is most encouraging.
Citizen: H. F. Whirlow, superin
tendent of the Lightner mine, at Ang
els, was In town In the early part of
this week. He reports the Lightner,
which Is largely owned by enterprising
Stocktonians, is doing splendidly.
The forty stamps of the new mill are
banging away day and night on rock
that averages at least $8 a ton, and the
future of the property never looked
more hopeful.
The Ford assessment has been ex
tended to the 20th instant. It is under
stood that this is done to accommodate
Mr. Gutmann, and local holders are
somewhat worried over the matter.
The company has paid off the $2000
second mortgage which was held by
.lames Casey 1 made Juno 14, 1899, by
banding over to Mr. Casey $2144 on
i.he 4tb instant. Work on the mine
continues with the usual force.
TUOLUMNE COUNTY.
Mother Lode Magnet: The incline
shaft at the Jumper mine is now down
nearly 1200 feet at which depth they
will crosscut to. cut the vein. The
stopes in the mine are looking well and
there are large ore reserves In sight.
The mill is dropping sixty stamps con
stantly, fifty on Jumper and . ten on
Golden Rule ore. The ore from the
latter, while not up to the standard, is
of fair grade, the 'vein being twelve
feet wide and the shoot 240 feet long.
Toney Ennis and Lee Bowen are
steadily at work on tho X-Ray mine in
the neighborhood of the famous Dens
more. A two and one-half-foot vein
has been encountered at a depth of
thirty-five feet which looks exceedingly
well.
Ed. Hill is once more to be seen in
our busy burg. He arrived herein
company with Manager Terry of the
California Marble Company and. will
run the Burleigh which has been re
cently installed at tho quarry.
Independent: A rich strike has been
made in the old Clio mine, Dear Jackson
ville, in a drift at the 100-foot level of
their new shaft. The vein is nearly six
feet wide, showing free gold in consider
able quantltity.
At the Gladstone and Stanley mines
in the Jacksonville vicinity, heavy rich
gold is being found which promises to
develop in something important. '
Preparations are being made for
sinking a new incline at the Over mine
on Bald mountain. Said shaft will be
started from the surface and will tap
the main and other shoots at a suffic
ient depth to work the property in
"apple pie" order. The gasoline en
gine heretofore used in the tunnel will
be placed in position to operate the
hoist. ' This mine has been a good pro
ducer and holds out every indication to
continue as such.
Mother Lode: The old mill at the
Seminole mine is being overhauled and
put in condition to commence dropping
stamps. Superintendent Safley is
pushing preparatory work on the mine
and will soon be extracting ore.
: The Fleming mine, near Coulter
ville, owned by 'J. H. Rogers, now of
Carters, has been bonded to a strong
company headed by James M. Meighan
and A. P. Dron. Work will be com
menced and crosscutted vigorously.
The machinery for the new mill at
the Temescal mine at Sugar Pine is
now at the depot here, and will be re
moved to the site as soon as possible.
Superintendent J. W. Brown informs
us that delay is caused by his inability
to get his lumber, which is at Hlatt
Bros, yards.
Democratic Banner: It is rumored
hereabouts that the mill on the Jeffer
son mine, near Groveland, was started
up a few days ago.
Sinking still continues at the Poison
Oak, situated a short 'distance south
west of Carters, and the ore is reported
as being of an extraordinary high
value.
John L. Tonkins, superintendent of
the Rising Sun, was in town Wednes
day and reports development work as
progressing satisfactorily at the mine.
The mill will be in operation soon.
The report that the Croesus mine
had resumed operations is, "we regret
very much to ' say, untrue. We have
no knowledge as to when it will be

The Croesus is undoubtedly a good
piece of property, and to obliterate the
false impression, which seems to have
been made by some notbing-else-to-do

work was entirely due to a dlsrgree
ment among the bond-holders. We
are satisfied the Croesus will hold a

HIS REMAINS WERE FOUND
William Reedy Perished
Near Oleta.
THREE WEEKS OF WANDERING ENDS IN DEATH
The Body Was In Good Condition.—
... The Ghastly Find Was Hade
By Arthur Stairm.
. The mysteries surrounding the sud
den | disappearance of William Reedy
from the home of his son-in-law, Ern
est Downing at Sutter Creek last
month have been cleared away. The
remains of the aged wanderer have
been found.
William Reedy arrived at Sutter
Creek from Pleasanton, on Satur
day evening, February 17th, to visit
the family of his son-in-law, Ern
est Downing. He stayed over' night
and the following morning (Sunday)
told his daughter he was going up to
the Lincoln mine where her husband
was at work. Hour after hour passed,
but Reedy did not return, and when
night came he was still absent. Search
was begun Immediately, but without
avail.
On Monday morning, the 19th, a
systematic search was begun. The
old man was traced through Amador
City to within a short distance of
Oleta. Constable D. F. Gray was
thorough in his search, but Reedy had
a thirty-six hours' start and the track
ing was difficult. At one time Gray
was within a half a mile of him, the
foot-prints being lost on a stretch of
ground of a lava formation.
He was seen by a Chinaman between
Volcano and Oleta, who gave a good
description of the demented wanderer.
Last Sunday morning, upon receipt
of a message that the body of the miss
ing man had been discovered by
Arthur Starns, near Oleta, .Constable
Gray and Undertaker E. Roberts of
Sutter Crek, departed immediately for
that place. The Coroner was notified
and loft Monday morning also.
Arthur Starns discovered the body
Saturday afternoon at four o'clock
about two miles above Oleta, and not
ified Constable Gray.
Upon the arrival of the authorities
the body and its surroundings were
minutely examined, after which the
body was placed in a coffin brought for
that purpose, and carried about a
quarter of a mile to the nearest road
and placed in a conveyance. -Coroner
Gritton then held an Inquest, the
Constable and undertaker . having to
serve on the jury in order that it
might be complete. After a careful in
vestigation it was found that William
Reedy came to his death on or about
the 20th day of February while wand
ering in the woods while partially in
sane. The Coroner's jury consisted of
D. F. Gray, E. Roberts, James R.
Vose, R. ,'D. Jones, Joseph Putt and D.
Hutchinson.
'Reedy was described as follows:
Height, five feet and three Inches;
weight, 105 or 110 pounds; age, 73 years;
complexion, sandy; chin whiskers two
and one-half Inches long, red and
slightly mixed with gray. Deceased
had on a suit of dark* clothes, a white
shirt, but no collar and wore a black
derby hat, on the inside of which his
name was written. In his pockets
were found $13.50 in coin, a pocket
knife and an old style stem- winding
watch.
The body was brought to Sutter
Creek Sunday and was shipped from
lone to Pleasanton for interment, Tues
day, accompanied by his son-in-law,
who came up Sunday night, and Ern
est Downing.
The remains were in good condition,
neither exposure nor animals injuring
them. No bruises or wounds were
found upon the body.
A reward of $40 was offered for the
recovery of the body by Ernest Down
ing, also $100, the latter being sent
to Arthur Starns Monday by Constable
Gray.
Squire Breese Passes Away.
Squire Breese passed away at his late
residence in Sutter Creek at 2 o'clock
on Saturday morning of last week,
after more than three score years and
ten of this life. He had been up all day
Friday and retired about 8 o'clock that
evening. In the morning about 2
o'clock he expired. Death is sup
posed to have resulted from feebleness
brought on by old age.
Deceased was born In St. Lawrence
county, New York, November 15, 1828.
In 1855 he came to California, locating
in El Dorado county, where he re
turned to New York for his wife and
only son, Raymond Breese. Ho re
turned with his family to El Dorado
county in 1859 and remained there un
til 1862 when they removed to Sutter
Creek, and resided there up to the
time of his death.
Mrs. S. L. Breese, five grand chil
dren and a daughter-in-law, all residing
in Amador county, and also three
brothers, residents of New York state,
survive him.
Interment took place at Sutter Creek
on Sunday.

MURDER AT SACRAMENTO
■ .■. ■ . ■■
Mrs. M. E. Brouhard One of
the Suspects.
I R. WATT'S BODY FOUND IH THE TULES
The Skull of the Murdered Man Was
\« Crushed by a Large Stone,
Which Was Found.
Mrs. Martha E. Brouhard is again
in trouble being mixed up in the Watt's
murder case at Sacramento. - . . . • ■ .
On Wednesday of last -week the
body of R. R. Watts was found in
the brush and water beyond the north
levee, at Sacramento by some boys.
This was the first inkling of a dark and
mysterious crime.
Letters . addressed to 626} I street,
Sacramento, were found on the person
of the deceased. This gave the officers
a clue. This place was visited by the
officers and found to be an employment
office kept by Mrs. Martha E. Brou
hard. At the time of the officers' visit
Mrs.' Brouhard, her clerk,' George ,W.'
Odell, and a young man named Charles
Bowen, wore down town to their supper.
As the parties left the restaurant they
were taken into custody and escorted
to the Sheriff's office.
Bowen said he had been employed in
Mrs. ' Brouhard 's mine in Amador
county, where, since last December,
Watt's had worked - at times. He
stated that he understood Watts had
borrowed some money and left. town
the day before he (Bowen) arrived, on
February 28th.
Watts' skull had been crushed with
a large jagged stone, which was found
nearby covered with hair and blood.
Mrs. Brouhard said Watts had been
hanging about her place of business
and that she had given orders to have
him thrown out.- He . tried to get her
to buy mining stock from him for $50,
and threatened her that if she did not
buy the stock he would lujure her in
her case in San Francisco.' She also
admitted that Bowen was her ex-hus
band and that the signature on the
pawn ticket was not really his own.
Watts was evidently not murdered
for the sake of robbery as so far as is
known he had no money, and Bowen
may yet be held responsible for his
dtath. .
Mrs. Brouhard was a few years ago
a resident of Amador county. She
was married to Daniel K. McManus,
who had an express wagon in Sacra
mento, his stand being in front of D. O.
Mill's bank. They then kept a lodging
house at Seventh and M streets, but
owing to the liquor habit contracted by
McManus, the place was closed, his
habit being distasteful and annoying to
guests. They afterwards came to
Amador connty and leased the place of
H. H. Page, near Forest Home," but
always had -trouble with the owner of
the property which was settled in the
courts.
On Sunday, October 7, 1894, some
difficulty arose between McManus and
his father-in-law, J. D. Maxwell, at
the latter's home on the Cosumnes
river, about three quarters of a mile
above the Wisconsin Bar bridge on the
road between Plymouth and ; Latrobe.
During the trouble Maxwell shot and
instantly killed McManus, his son-in
law, the ball entering the left side
about four inches below the nipple and
severing the main arteries of the
heart. Death resulted . from internal
hemorrhage.
Mrs. Brouhard was at that time well
known in that part of the county and
had many friends.
Sheriff Mclnnis of Reno, Nev., and
Deputy Sheriff J. J. Hinters of Sacra
mento, effected the capture of Mark
Westlake, who has been directly ac
cused of killing R. R. Watts, last Tues
day. The suspect arrived in Reno two
weeks ago and registered at a hotel
under an assumed name. He bad se
cured work with a section gang, and
was working on the track a mile west
of Reno when the officers approached.
He attempted to hide in the brush
but was quickly found and handcuffed.
His valise and the shoes he wore were
said to have been the property of the
murdered man.' The prisoner was
taken to Sacramento by the deputy.
It has since been found that there is
strong evidence against Westlake and
his brother. The suspected persons
had their clothes covered with mud
and Wattb was slain at a muddy spot.
Mrs. Westlake is angry and will testify
against her husband. Mrs. Brouhard
is the arch-conspirator.
Granted An Injunction.
Judge Morrow of the United States
Circuit Court yesterday gave a verdict
in favor of the plaintiffs in the injunc
tion suit brought by Percy L. Shuman
and Gustave Banmann vs. Isaac M. de
Witt. The defendant is tho owner of
the Haley mine in Amador county,
and sometime ago he entered into a
contract with the plaintiffs to run a
tunnel 1,000 feet long in" the mine,
plaintiffs to bear all the expenses
and have all the gold and silver
they extracted from the tunnel. ; They
were also privileged to sell the mine,
and, failing to do so, were to pay de
Witt one-tenth of what they took out.
De Witt prevented the plaintiffs from
carrying out their contract, and a re
straining order was asked for to pre
vent him from further interferring
with their operations. — Examiner.

MIDNIGHT VISITORS.
They Inspected the Back Door of the Su-
perior Candy Store.
' On Friday night of last week, while
W. T. Cain was sitting in the back
room of his candy store about 11 o'clock
some one walked up to the door and
gave it a bang as though he wanted to
get in. Mr. Cain jumped ' up and ask
ed,."Who's there?" He received no
answer. Cain then rushed through
the store and down the street to get
the nightwatchman. He found Night
Watchman Parker in front of the
Snug saloon, and together they went
back to investigate, but no trace of any T
one could be found.
At the time the unknown person at
tempted to enter the store everything
was lighted up. There are two win
dows in the back room through one of
which the interior of the room can be
viewed.. It was rather a peculiar way
to try to break into the place.
. On the same night an attempt to en
ter both the Fuller and Driscoll resi
dences at j Scottsville, and also James

A Broken Arm.
Herbert Palmer had his arm broken
yesterday afternoon at the Argonaut
mill. He and his partner, D. Boro,
were hoisting about 1500 pounds of
sulphurets from the floor to
its position from which the sul
phurets is recleaned by a concentrator.
The hoisting was done by a windlass
and they bad raised the truck of sul
phurets a few feet when the crank
slipped and as it came around caught
Palmer between the wrist and elbow on
the right hand breaking the radius.

. . i
i
How . the Remotest Stars Have
Been Seen by Unman Bye.'
Those of us who have always clung
to the belief that this plant of ours has
Its position in <:. ■ .
An aerial universe
. Of unlimited expansion, at which the soul
' Aches to think, intoxicated with eternity.
will be startled by the announcement
that the limits of the universe have
been reached by human vision, says
the Philadelphia Record. This astound
ing information comes from no less an
authority than Professor • Newcomb,
who is recognized as one of the great
est of living astronomers, , if Indeed he
Ye not the most eminent of them all.
According to Professor Newcomb, evi
dence In accumulating which points to
a probability that the small stars
which our powerful modern telescopes
have brought Into view do not | look
small by .reason of their distance from
this earth, but because they are really
of Inferior size. Beyond . them he be
lieves it probable that there are no oth
ers. In other words. If Professor New
comb's theory be correct we are actu
ally able to see the boundaries of our
universe.
The general form of this universe
has been described to us. * It is an enor
mous disk, the solar system being not
far from the center. This disk, so In
conceivably vast, bas a diameter four
or five times Its thickness, but as to the
length of the diameter we cannot
speak with accuracy, because we are
not acquainted ' with the ' precise i dis
tance of many of the stars. Fifty or a
hundred years hence a great deal more
will be known on that subject than
we of today know. It* has been esti
mated, however, that the distance
across the disk from one side of the
universe to the other' Is 20,000 (or may
be 30,000) "light" years. In this esti
mate there is naturally a wide margin
of guess. A "light" year Is the distance
which a ray of light will traverse in
one of our years. The speed of light
being 180,000 miles a second, a "light"
year is equivalent to 5,869,588,980,000
miles. The distance across the disk in
question would therefore be this stu
pendous number of miles multiplied by
20,000 or by 30,000. Again, It takes a
little over eight minutes for light to
come to us from the sun, 93,000,000
miles away. The light by which ; we
are able to see a very distant star
through a telescope may have started
from that star 25,000 years ago. 'As
suming that to be the case, It is 25,000
"light" years away from us.
With the naked eye we can see about
5,000 stars, with a very powerful tele
scope we can see about 50,000,000, and
there Is no telling how many millions
more there are unobserved. The radius
of the earth's orbit, -a line 90,000,000
miles In length, not only vanishes from
sight before we reach the distance of
the great mass of stars, but from that
distance becomes such a mere point
that the most delicate appliances fail
to make It measurable.
Character of Thorite.
I . Brigadier General A. ' D. Burlington,
chief of the ordnance department of
the army, in his annual report for tbe
fiscal year ended June 30 speaks In
terms of commendation of tbe new 'ex
plosive, thorite. All the tests of thorite
have not been made, but those that
have been carried out, he says,' were
very satisfactory and were designed to
show that the mixture could not be ex
ploded by friction or by shock and Im
pact. Tbe last tests were made 1 by
mechanical means and by firings made
from cannon of various calibers, some
of the firings being against plates. | In
the experiments | against plates the
shells penetrating were recovered with
out material deterioration. Tests were
also made to show the Insensibility of
this substance to heat and its strength
as shown by the fragmentation tests of
projectiles. General Buffington says
that as regards stability but little can
be said at present, but a quantity of
the mixture in storage for some time in
an ordinary < shed at the proving
grounds, during which it absorbed
considerable moisture, showed no dete
rioration. The subsequent drying jof
the substance Indicated that Its quali
ties when damp had not been Impaired.
In view of the results obtained In the
tests of thorite the ordnance board, un
der whose supervision tbe tests have
been made, reports that It Is of the
opinion that It is superior to any other
material for adoption In service, at
least pending the development of any
better material for tbe purpose. It re
mains, however, to secure a good de
tonating fuse.
Dates In Arizona,
While able to \ withstand considera
ble frost in winter the date palm must
have a very dry and exceedingly hot
climate at the time of the ripenlug of
the dates. .The sandiest and, general
ly speaking, the poorest soils produce
the best dates. While it will yield in
any soil It takes most kindly to other
wise almost worthless land, even that
which is white with alkali suiting it.
Still, an abundance of water Is at cer
tain periods of Its maturing quite nec
essary. Arizona Is thought to be a
eood field for late, growing. - T ■
Graduating Thermometer*.
According to the usual practice, the
graduations on the thermometer scales
and levels are marked by scratching
the surface of the glass In some way
at each point where there Is to be a
graduation, says Popular Science. But
the glass Is weakened in each of these
points and Is apt to break,- which Is
dangerous In the case of boiler levels.
It Is evident that this could be avoided
by softening slightly the surface of the
glass at the desired points and mixing
some coloring matter with it An
American firm asserts that It has ob
tained this result under the best con
ditions by passing over the tube where
a graduation Is to be marked nu Iron
disk turning at the rate of 2,400 revo
lutions a minute. The friction causes
a rise of temperature sufficient partly
to melt the glass, and at the same time
small particles of iron are detached
from the wheel and become Incorporate
ed in tbe softened class.

DentUta Show Why the Habit Should
Be Abolished.
"Decay of the teeth, or, as we call It.

ter how fine a set of teeth you have, if
you kiss a person who has decayed

A young woman ; whom -I know and
who by inheritance possessed a mar
velously perfect set of teeth, was ro
bust and of extremely cleanly habits
used to come to me and have her teeth
cleaned when only the closest scrutiny
could detect the stains which she wish

never needed a filling. About that time
nlie brought to my office a young man
whom she Introduced as her nance.
He wished my professional services,
and I gave to him an appointment. An
examination disclosed a filthy mouth.
It jvas necessary, to use corrective
agents before I could tolerate him.
Had it not been that he was engaged
to marry a girl whom I knew to be
ideally hygienic, I should not have giv
en to the cleansing of his teeth the
amount of attention which I did, be
cause I recognized in him a man care
less of his teeth and breath, who would
be unapprcciative of my efforts. It re
quired three sittings to get his teeth
Into a semblance of cleanliness, j and
then he refused to have the gaping
carious caverns filled. I remonstrated.
I spoke of the perfect teeth of. his in

asked what difference it made to' her.
I explained. I could do no more. They
were married, and before a year elaps
ed I was obliged to Insert seven or
eight fillings in her teeth. She now has
a full set of artificial teeth.
"I knew a young man who had his
teeth ruined by keeping company with
a girl who had unclean teeth. She was
good looking, but he did not marry her

not decayed since."

provements in the mail boxes and mail
pouches, proposed methods of picking
up and delivering mail from flying
railroad trains, etc. Andrew L. Henry
of Ladoga, Ind., has hit upon a star
tlingly novel arrangement In this al
ready overworked field, but, like many
of such inventions, it is probably im
practical. It is a system of receiving
and delivering mail for use In towns in
conjunction with horse and wagon col
lections and is designed to enable the
postman to make his rounds accom
plished by attaching the mail boxes to
their supports with a yielding fasten
ing of some kind, such as a chain and
weight. The box Is" shown in the illus
tration attached to a post by means of
chains and is provided with a counter
weight and a handle for greater con
venience. The postman, it is supposed,
drives up, reaches out his hand, grasps
the handle and lifts the mail box into
the wagon, where its contents are re
moved. It Is then locked and gently
lowered into its original position on the

The Life of Timber.
Oak piling in salt water sometimes
lasts no longer than nine years, but It
has been known to survive 40 years.
In fresh water Its life ranges from 8 to
30 years, with an average of 20; In
dry land oak lasts from 8 to 20 years,
with an average of 12 years. Cedar
Is good for 20 and chestnut from 12 to
40 years. One may ask why it is there
is such a difference. One answer is
the mineral ingredients of the soil af
fect the timber. In bridge timbers
which are kept free from dirt accu
mulations oak has been known to last
as long as- 50 years. Yellow pine. If
unprotected, runs all the way from 8
to 20 yeacs, white pine from 8 to 18
years, Norway from 8 to 10 years,
spruce from 5 to 10 years, fir from 10
to 20 years. Vertical timbers are found
to last nearly twice as long as horizon
tal timbers.
How to Hake Hair Grow,

fitted -with a time fuse, which is "'set"
to fire the bursting charge at a given

Sotkern'a Recitation.
Sir Edward Russell knew E. A . Soth
ern, the actor, lutiinately and In his
book, "That Iteuiinds Me." tells many
stories of him.
He was dining at Portsmouth or
somewhere at a regimental mess -to
which the officers had asked him with
every show of the highest' admiration
and with no appearance of social su
periority. ,;■ After dinner, as the party
sat at wine, one of the officers asked
Bothern to give them a recitation. Now.
Bothern abominated that kind of thing.
He wouldn't tolerate being treated
us an entertainer when he was by way
of being treated as a gentleman. He
coldly declined. They pressed him.
He hotly declined. Still they pressed
htm. He expressed his feelings. Per
haps the officers were a little affected
by. wine. At all events they "persist
ed. They would take no denial.
At last he said in a manner which
showed that he was nettled, but yet
yielding: "Well, if you won't let me
off ' I must. I'll give you the dinner
scene from 'David Garrick.' "
He did. He had never acted it bet
ter. They were delighted until, spring
ing to his feet, be made his wild, tipsy
exit, just as he did on the stage, and
dragged the cloth off the table and
with it all tbe regiment's prized, des
sert china and decanters and glasses,
etc. Great was the smash. The actor
did not, wait to be applauded or to im
prove the occasion. The lesson was,' in
deed, a rough one, and probably only a
man with some roughness . in his dar
ing humor would have given it, but it
was quite .deserved.
How Hard Bees Work.
Darwin after close observation found
that a bee would often visit as many
as 27 Sowers in tbe course of a minute,
though with other plants in which the
honey was difficult to extract the aver
age would be as low as seven. Strik
ing a moan between these two figures,
one may say that an ordinary working
bee visits 15 flowers a minute, or 000
n n hour. Considering tbe late hours to
which a boe works. It Is probably no
exaggeration to say that It Is busy for
olghl hours a day. allowing for Inter
vals of rest. This would make It visit
7,'J00 flowers a day. or 648.000 In a pe
riod of six months.
Mr. A. S. Wilson In a recent paper
showed the enormous amount of labor
gone through by bees In making even
a small quantity of honey. He found
that approximately 125 beads of red
clover yield 15 grains of sugar, or 125,
000 beads about two pounds. As each
bead contains some (iO florets. It fol
lows that 7.500,000 distinct flower
tubes must be sucked In order to ob
tain two pounds of sugar. Now.' honey
contains, roughly speaking. 75 per cent
of sugar: therefore the bees must make.
In round numbers, 2.500,000 visits for
one pound of honey.
Question Is Unansn-ered.
A certain grocer on the bill bas for
some days been looking for the owner
of a voice that claimed bis attention at
the telephone one busy morning. When
he finds the man, the meeting will fur
nish material for an Interesting item,
and the following dialogue explains it
self:
Tbe Voice— Hello, tberel Is that you.
Tbe Have you any salt fish?
The Voice— ls It fresh?
Grocer— Yes; came In this morning. '
The Voice— Cod or pollock?
Grocer— Got both: Which do you
want?
The Voice— Well. 1 don't know. Is
the pollock good and dry?
Grocer— Yes.
The Voice— Well, .why don't yon give
it a drink, then?
At this point the grocer brought ibe
colloquy to a sudden termination with
a remark that would be out of place in
polite society and therefore unfit for
publication.— Portland (Or.) Argus
Mice as Food In China.
The first thing which strikes the
traveler In China upon his entrance In
to any of the many cities of the Coles
tial empire is the strings of dried mice
which bang from the roofs of the
bouses suspended by their tails, just as
sausages are hung In front of buti.-her
shops In France.
The Chinese bunt these mice with a
long, sharp pointed knife, which they
plunge Into the animals' throats. Then
the mice are suspended-by the tails un
til the blood has dripped out, when
they are skinned, drawn and smoked.
