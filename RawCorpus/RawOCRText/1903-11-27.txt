TWO STOCK EXCHANGES.
Differences Between the New York
and Berlin Institutions. :
If any member of the New York
Stock Exchange who is entirely unac
quainted with German speculation
should visit the Berlin bourse he would
find at every point the most striking
divergencies from his home experience.
He would be surprised to see the
bourse attended by quite 2,000 persous,
including clerks of banks, newspaper
laen and even visitors like himself.
Also, he would be Interested in the Im
mense size of tbe hall— 3oo feet long, di
vided by colonnades into three sections,
one of which is assigned to tlie Produce
Exchange. On one side of the hall sev
eral doors open into a grassy court,
shaded by trees and surrounded by a
pillared lobby, where brokers sit in dull
summer days and float their latest
stock of anecdotes.
That shaded court is suggestive of
etcipper differences between the New
York Stock Exchange- and the Berlin
institution. In New York the number
of members is fixed and is small in pro
portion to the Immense volume of busi
ness done. In Berlin there Is a great
horde of small dealers, and the amount
of trading is much less than In New
York. Owing to the easy terms of ad
mission, the bourse becomes a mere
place where traders meet to effect their
transactions. There is no sale of seats.
In fact, no membership fee exists, but
only a small yearly tax is collected,
which varies from time to time as the
expenses of tbe organization require.
Contrary to New York practice, mem
bership is largely held by companies
and firms. Nearly all the banks of the
city, for example, are members, and
the more important ones keep above a
score of their employees on the floor.
Thus the individual New York broker,
as a rule, counts for vastly more than
a member of the bourse. New York is
concentrated, is intense. Berlin dis
perses its energy, and is comparatively
dull. It knows nothing of those great
days of triumph or disaster that render
the annals of Wall street picturesque.
And it lacks our large daring operators
who startle the country with their bold
schemes.— William C. Dreher.in Cen
tury.
A Water Test.
It is one of the easiest things in the
world to tell pure water from the im
pure. If you want to test the color of
the water just fin a colorless glass bot
tle with tlu* whter and look through It
at some black object, and the distlnc
tiveuess with which you can see the
object will give you an idea as to the
amount of clay or sand there is in the
water. Then pour, out one-half the wa
ter, cork the bottle tightly and spt It
la a warm place for about twenty-four
hours. Remove the cork and smell the
nir in the bottle. If there is an olIVu
■lye odor, even the slightest, the water
is unfit for domestic- uses. Well water,
no matter how bright and sparkling, is
nine times out of ten putreseent. Then,
as a matter of course, decomposition is
sure to set in in a day or two if you
put the bottle In a warm place.
The Real Force.
"Man does bis best when he Is hard
put to it. Necessity, you know, is the
mother of invention." said the observer
of men and things.
"Yes," replied the benedict, "but If
necessity were Invention's mother-in
law then you'd see how invention
would Lave to hump itself."—Philadel

DOUGLAS
Copyright, 1903, by T. 0. Mcdurt
Rufus, or, to give him his title cou
pled with tbe name bestowed upon him
■ by his sponsors in baptism, Cadet Lieu
tenant James Woodward Sims, U. S. N.,
was in love.
That it was an attack of cadet love
his classmates emphatically denied. At
Annapolis the accepted proverb is "ca
det love is akin to calf love," and they
could not detect symptoms of the latter
malady In Rufus.
The fact that he was in love was
evinced when Reardon, his roommate,
came suddenly upon the young man in
a reverie of which tue luside boards of
bis locker door seemed to be the object.
Reardon coughed and otherwise made
bis presence known. If Rufus had been
caught in the act of scaling tbe wall he
could not have exhibited a more guilty
expression. For the first time in their
acquaintance Reardon saw tbe big lieu
tenant blush like a schoolgirl. His color
rivaled the auburn of his bair, from
which he derived his sobriquet
A photograph of a girl bung on the
inner side of the locker door. The usual
array of athletes, family portraits or
footlight favorites was absent. This
picture alone adorned the space.
Reardon looked at the picture for a
minute. "Studying glrlology, Rufus?"
he asked to break tbe awkward silence.
"Looks like it, doesn't it?" Rufus'
embarrassment was evident
"It needs study, old man. A fellow
must study it carefully, and even then
he often 'flunks' when the test comes."
"This species needs it," admitted Ru
fus, looking up at the face In the pho
tograph.
"Yes," said Reardon in a slightly in
terrogative tone. He did not want to
seem curious.
"She— it's Bess, you know— writes me
that she will be unable to come to the
farewell hop. She has a previous en
gagement, she says."
"Perhaps she has," Reardon suggest
ed by way of consolation, although the
idea seemed ludicrous to him. A previ
ous engagement when the Annapolis
farewell hop was In question!
"Well, but she couldn't, man— that Is,
we have talked of It the whole year—
and when I was at home on the last
leave we— well, Reardon, we sort of
fixed things up, you know," confessed
Rufus, the deep red dodging through
his skin again. "And she said she
would be down for the hop and to our
graduation. I suppose it's her wom
an's prerogative to change her mind,
but"— Rufus hesitated.
"I understand, old man. It's a bit
rough on a fellow. She may explain
later." Reardon felt awkward in the
role of sympathizer. It was such a for
eign element in his relation with Ru
fus.
"There's one little thread of possibil
ity in some nonsense which has passed
between us that might explain matters
to me; but, oh, it is such an absurd,
such an utterly impossible, reason, that
I would not suggest it to her."
Rufus was silent Should he put in
to words the; foolish little matter which
had been weighing upon his mind?
Reardon looked nt him expectantly.
"You know, Reardon, how we fel
lows always joke and laugh about the
necessity of naval officers marrying
money. You realize that on every oc
casion we give vent to. the time worn
declaration that we must have a girl
with capital. I, like the rest of you,
have done It, and— well, Bess was qual
ified in that direction, though it never
occurred to me at the time.
"Recently her father met with re
verses — not serious," you understand
but, oh, hang it, don't you see? She
might have taken all that nonsense se
riously," finished Rufus. He did not
look up at Reardon.
And Reardon did just the wrong
thing at that moment. He laughed. It
all seemed so far out of the limits of
possibility.
"Forgive me, Rufus," he said, put
ting out his hand, "but I could not help
it Cheer up. And, I say, Rufus, don't
you think perhaps overstudy has affect
ed your head?" he said, significantly In
dicating his head.
Rufua smiled in spite of himself and
srasped'his roommate's band.
"Perhaps," he said, closing the locker
door and taking up his cap. "Going to
Mrs. Butler's?"
The latter question was quite unnec
essary, for Mrs. Butler was the wife of
Lieutenant Commander Butler of tbr
Naval academy, and her teas were gen
erally considered the last torments of
the first class man, not that (lioy wen
unpleasant, but they were a duty, n
part of their education for the life of 0
naval officer.
Personally Rufus considered them
les3 of a duty than v pleasure) for hp
had spent several pleasant hours with
the gracious hostess.
As they pulled the old fashioned
knocker of the house in Blake row Ru
fus pulled himself together as if to cast
all sentimental thoughts from his mind.
If Bess had a "previous en^agemout"
she might keep it.
"Mr. Sims, how do you do? And Mr,
Reardon?" snid Mrs. Cutler, from be
hind the tea table. "Perhaps i was ju«t
looking for you." ; ' ■■: - >-.'ii'-
. "We will give ourselves the. benefit
of the doubt, eb, Rufus?" Reardon said,
glancing about the raom. Here and
there were little groups of cadets.
"Very well. Which of you is at liber
ty for the farewell hop?" Mrs. Butler
laughed with the consciousness of hav
ing asked a preposterous question.
Both cadets causrht the infeetioiw
laugh, but neither sjjolic for a minute—
Reardon because be must say be was
engaged and Rufus. because he could
not quite make up his mind to offer bis
services for the evening.
"Strange as it may seem, Mrs. But
ler, I am not escorting any one and am
at your sen-ice," Rufus said after a
minute. "You have a guest?"
_"I will have. She writes me today
that she is coming. She is not aware
of the fact that tbe hop Is that night,
I believe, and I was at a loss for some
one to attend to her dance order. Mr.
Sims, let me give you another cup of
tea to thank you."
Reardon, looking on, thought he de
tected a twinkle in his hostess' eyes.
She was unusually frivolous, he
thought; but, then, it was the end of
the term.
"You may only thank me by permit
ting me to escort you as a chaperon."
Rufus was nothing if not gallant.
But when Rufus was again In' his
quarters he felt less pleased over the
responsibility he had assumed for the
evening. What an effort he would have
to make to be even civil to tbe strange
young person.
The chaperon had not yet made her
appearance after the introduction. Sho
had been summoned to the telephone
or something.
Cadet Lieutenant Sims was doing un
military things with his arms and say
ing anything but the platitudes he
would be expected to utter on first ac
quaintance with a pretty young wom
an.
"It's only a little joke of mine/ and
Mrs. Butler helped me out," Bess was
saying In strangely smothered tones.
VI knew what fun it would be to see
you when you camp here for the strange
girl and found me. Yes, I'll admit it
was the fact of papa's losing a little
money that suggested It all. I could
not resist it. Yon had your little joke;
I had mine."
"But yours was cruel, wasn't it— just
a little, dear? You"— Rufus stopped
suddenly, and Bess became interested
In a large painting of the lieutenant
commander.
"You seem to be getting acquainted
very quickly," laughed Mrs. Butler in
the doorway. "But our cadets have a
reputation in that direction."
Preaching and Practice.
Spellbinder— Yes, my friends, eternal
vigilance is the price of liberty. Be on
your guard. A word to the wise is suf
ficient.
Voice (from the audience)— Then you
must take us for gol darn fools! You
have been talking for an hour and a
half.— Kansas City Journal.
A Slap at Whistler.
A young San Franciscan, the owner
of a large and valuable collection of au
tographs, once wrote to James MneNeill
Whistler, politely requesting his signa
ture. The letter was sent in care of
the London Royal academy, with which
the famous American painter was at
outs. After four months the letter was
returned to the San Francisco address
from the dead letter office in Washing
ton. Covering the envelope was tbe
word, repeated numberless times, "Un
known."
COURTING IN IRELAND.
Lovers and Lovemaklng In the Land
of the Shamrock.
The Jrlsh way of courting in the old
days a'ud In quiet country places even
to the present day was and is very dif
ferent 'from that style of thing whlcb
makes the subject of many finely paint
ed romances. There were no stolen in
terviews, no twilight walks, no thought
of kisses or even hand clasps— in short,
tio lovemaking whatever. But if they
tvere at reaping or haymaking Peter
took hfei place next to Rosie, helped to
bind bpr sheaves when his own were
done and at noonday took his share of
soda cak« nnd his draft of milk from
her hands. Then in the quiet evening,
when the work was done and the even
ing tuealwas over, Peter would rise
and look out of the door and say to his
father or sisters: " 'Tis a fine night. I
think I'll go for a bit of a stroll." And
the bit of a stroll inevitably ended on
tbe nuyyw path through the whin
buslieV-u'p" to the stile, over which it
was but three Bteps into Alec McCros
san's haggard, and then across to where
the firelight shone welcoming through
an open door.
Around the fire the family circle was
widened to make room for him, as a
matter of course. Maybe he took a
draw at the pipe, and maybe he didn't.
Anyhow he would sit there quiet and
contented for long enough, talking all
the time to McCrossan or the neighbor
men, but with quiet, happy eyes watch
ing Rosie, tbe loved and cbosen one, as
she sat in the flickering light or moved
about the room. And there was a gleam
In her eyes and a smile on her lips
which told him he was welcome and
bade him stay long and come again
soon, and in his heart- was a firm re
solve, as soon as ever he saw his way
to marrying, that he would have Rosie
and no other.
This, In spite of all that is written In
story books and silly .' romances or
shown on the stage, is the recognized
and seemly Irish way of courting.—

The Sun Makes Rooms Dusty.
There is more dust in the places il
luminated by the sun's rays than in
those which we call shady.
If you look along a beam of light as
it streams through a window or a chink
in the door, you will see innumerable
dust particles dancing about in the
light You will be told by most per
sons that there is just as much dust In
the nonilluminated parts of the room
as in the more favored spaces, but you
cannot sco the particles because the
rays do not fall directly upon them
You will think that this is eminently
plausible, but It is not the case.
The sun falling upon the air creates
irregular currents, and these currents
stir up the dust and collect it In lay
ers along the line of light; hence there
Is more dust where the sun shines than
elsewhere.
A curious experience in a museum
gave proof of this. It was noticed that
there was always more dust on the
glass cases exposed to the sunbeams
than on those which were never touch
ed by the rays of the great orb, and
this led to an inquiry, with the above
result
It will generally be found that It
takes longer to clean the sunny parts
of a large room than it does to wipe
up the dust particles from the shady
•nooks.
An Overworked Woman.
I stopped to get a glass of milk the
other day at a New Jersey farmhouse,
said the commuter, and the female
head of the establishment, who had
six .children playing around, was in
clined to repine at her bard luck in
having so much work to do.
"I run this whole farm," she re
marked in a tone which Indicated that
she was ready to resign.
"How many acres have you?" I In
quired.
"A hundred and forty."
"Got any stock?"
"Ten head of cattle, two cows, six
hogs and work horses for the place."
"And you run the whole business?"
I asked.
"Indeed, I do; every hide and hair of
it," she sighed.
"Don't you hire some help?"
"Of course, but 'taint hired help that
takes the load offen one's body." There
was some in that, and I
paused. a minute. •_
"Haven't you got a husband?" I then
asked sympathetically.
"Yes," she said sternly, "but, you see,
I have to run him too."— New York

Judges on Circuit.
It was the genius and foresight of
Henry I. that saw the necessity of cre
ating a close connection between the
central king's court and the local
courts up and down the land. It was
Norman and wandering, going where
the king went They were Saxon and
stationary; hence, to link them togeth
er, in 1124 a special deputation of
judges was for the first time sent on
circuit in the country, of whom it is
recorded that they "hanged so many
lhieves as never was before, being in
that little while altogether forty-four
men."
This vigorous administration of jus
tice by royal authority gained for Hen
ry the title of "the lion of justice" and
paved the way for the permanent insti
tution in his grandson's reign. These
traveling judges were called justices
in-eyre—i. c., in itinere, on journey.
Their head, the justiciar, is still seen in
our title, the lord chief justice.
Henry 11. in 1173 fixed these circuits
at six — the home, midland, eastern,
western, northeastern and northern,
which correspond roughly with those
that still exist— London Standard.
American Grit.
"I'm used to being drowned," writes
a Kansas City merchant, "but It is
crowding the mourners to have the
price of beef rise because the Missouri
river does." That humorous Btream,
which now takes away your farm in
the night and transfers.it to your neigh
bor, now annexes his holdings to your
own, now overflows you altogether, is a
good symbol of American fortune. Bury
the dead, get a new suit of clothes on
credit, and to work again! — Every
body's Magazine.
So Nice and Sympathetic.
A. gentleman whose one glass eye
has served him for years had the mis
fortune to drop It. It smashed to
atoms. This happened when he was
far away In the country. He Inquired
of a friend where was the nearest
place for him to go and get refitted.
"Why don't you call upon the girl
you were flirting with all last night?"
his friend Inquired. "She has a first
class reputation for making eyes."—

A south sea Islander at the close of
a religious meeting offered the follow
ing prayer: "O God, we are about to

The Valne of ft Vacation.
A vacation pays as much from the
standpoint of character as from any
other point of view. Just as "every
man is a rascal when he is sick," so the
best intentloned man in the world may
be a brute when he is worn out phys
ically and working and planning ot
trying to do so with a fagged, weary
brain. The brutal qualities in a man's
nature come to the surface when he
has drained his vitality to the dregs.
He loses his self control and his pas
elons get the better of him. He does
things which in his soul be condemns
and says' things for which he after
ward hates himself, and all because he
lacks physical stamina. The long strain
of the year has made him so irritable
and exacting that the merest trifle up
sets him. He goes all to pieces over
little things which he would not even
notice if he were In good bodily condi
tion.—Success.

Is the old Jewish cemetery. It is in the

THE PANAMA IMBROGLIO.
The isthmian canal at Panama is
a commercial necessity. Its con
struction is demanded by the 'senti
ment of the civilized world. It is
equally manifest that the United
States, owing to its paramount in
terests, and its boundless resources,
is the proper power to build it. The
effete Colombian government, and
the newly organized state of Panama,
lack the push and means to under
take the task. Destiny inevitably
points to the United States govern
ment as the source through which
this boon to commerce must come.
The nation has set the seal of ap
proval upon the project. This does
not imply that methods involving a
departure from time-honored princi
ples, and the sacrifice of national
honor, will be indorsed in the attain
ment of this end. Better the canal
remain uncut for another generation
than that it should be undertaken
as the outcome of intrigue and revo
lution, countenanced or fostered by
the United States.
The law of self-defense is applicable
to nations as to individuals. Forty
years ago the United States gov
ernment was engaged in the bloodi
est civil war of history to maintain
its territorial integrity. We pro
tested against-ahy recognition of the
belligerent rights of the seceding
states. The world looked on, with
out interference, and saw the strug
gle fought to a finish, with the
national domain unimpaired at the
close. The lapse of years cannot
change a, principle. The fact that
the United States has guaranteed
that traffic across the isthmus of
Panama shall be uninterrupted, can
not be pleaded as an excuse to pre
vent the United States of Columbia
doing today what this government
did in 1861— employing its military
forces to coerce a seceding state.
The government of Columbia cannot,
owing to the mountainous nature of
the country, send troops by land to
recover its territory, and it is claim
ed that the United States will not
permit any troops to be dispatched
by sea. This simply means that the
power of this government will be
exercised if necessary to prevent
the forcible return of Panama to the
sisterhood of Columbian states. No
doubt the South American govern
ment tried to drive a hard bargain
with the United States in demand
iug an outrageous sum for the privi
lege of digging the canal. It was in
the nature of a hold-up. But it
must be admitted that Columbia was
acting within her national rights.
It was her privilege to sell or not to
sell, and to fix the price. The price
was higher than anticipated, but
this affords no pretext for encourag
ing revolt and disunion. The atti
tude of the United States in this
matter — if her attitude is correctly
gauged by current reports — will
hardly meet the approving verdict
of history.
SEEKING FOR AN ALLIANCE.
The Hearst papers are clamoring
for an aliiauce of the democratic and
labor parties for the presidential
campaign. They point to the munic
ipal election in San Francisco as an
example of the folly of independent
action. By unitiny the parties it is
argued that they would have made a
clean sweep. The application of this
advice is intended to have a much
wider range than state and munici
pal affairs. It is nothing less than
an intimation for the democracy and
the labor union vote to pool their
issues, and show a united front for
the campaign of 1904. Beyond this
it is a boost of \V. R. Hearst for the
presidential nomination. No doubt
-Hearst has some strength with that
element of the laboring men who
favor dragging the unions into poli
tics. He is weak with the straight
out democrats. By inveigling both
parties to join hands, he hopes to se
cure the place of standard bearer,
with a chance to win out. Hearst
is putting forth every effort to
ingratiate himself with both parties.
A few days ago he forwarded a
check for $500 to help the street car
strikers in Chicago. The gift was
heralded in the newspapers, all for
political effect. Such tactics with
the presidency as the ultimate prize
in view, are nauseating to the
American people generally Hearst
may capture the nomination, but he
will never win his way to the con
fidence of the voters thereby. The
truth is, Hearst has nothing to rec
ommend him but his wealth. Wealth
is powerful in many ways, but it has
never yet proved much of a factor-in
placing a man in the white house.
Democracy is hard pressed indeed,
if it takes up Hearst on the double
face proposition.
ASSESSMENT OF POSSESSORY
RIGHTS.
There seems to be considerable
difference of opinion regarding the
collection of taxes levied against
land held under possessory right,
and prior to the issuance of final
proof. It has been the cust"m in
this county, and doubtless the same
rule has been followed in other coun
ties, to assess not only the improve
ments but the land itself from the
time of the homestead filing all
through the five years' period of set
tlement prior 10 the offering of final
proof. During this period the title
is vested in the United States, and
inasmuch as United States and state
and county property is not subject
to taxation, it is claimed by some
that a possessory right cannot be
legally assessed. This question has
led to much discussion, and not a
little misunderstanding. The law
perhaps is not well settled on the
proposition, and whether the ques
tion has ever been definitely settled
by the courts we do not know. We
do know, however, that property
holders in this county who have
come into possession of lands re
cently patented, have been surprised
to find that taxes of many years
standing, are clamoring for payment
before the title can be cleared. We
do not attempt to discuss the legal
phase of this matter. But for all
practical purposes, it may be well
to state that when possessory claims
have been assessed, and the property
has been allowed to be sold for de
linquent taxes, and where a patent
to the land has been subsequently
secured by the party who held the
possessory title, the state authori
ties hold that such taxes become a
lien against the property, and must
be paid. Of course, where the
possessory title is not followed by a
patent, and another claimant files
upon the land, the taxes assessed to
the prior, settler cannot be collected.
To avoid misunderstanding, and the
consequent piling up of penalties
upon lands held under this kind of a
title, homestead settlers upon gov
ernment land will save trouble by
paying the small taxes assessed
against their holdings during the
five years probationary period.^ That
is the safest and easiest, and in most
cases the most economical course to
adopt.

Deafness is caused by an inflamed con

flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is tho result,
and unless tho inflammation can bo
taken out and this tubo restored to it*

SOCIALISTIC TENDENCY.
To the fanatical doctrines of the
socialists is attributed much of the
labor troubles that have affected the
country during the past decade. To
understand their tenets is a difficult
matter for an outsider, because they
reject every accepted theory and
maxim of political ethics and politi
cal economy. Without any mis
representation it may be truly s:iid,
that the cornerstone of the system
is the maxim that "might makes
right" in nil matters pertaining to
the distribution of property. With
this as its fulcrum and universal
suffrage as its lever, the propaganda
proposes to turn the world upside
down. It thus appears that force
and power are the substitutes for all
the old-time ethics of property rights
and that the doctrines which our
forefathers used in taking possession
of the lands of the Indians are adopt
ed by the socialists in their claim
for the public, appropriation of all
private property. The fact that the
organization is so fanatical renders
it all the more dangerous, for there
is too much method in its madness
to excite the laughter and derision
which it justly deserves. — Pacific
"Coast Miner.
The Royal mine at Hodson has
been closed down because of demands
made upon the owners by the union
miners. Is it not about time ' that
the . truth dawned upon the labor
unions that this shutting down of
one enterprise after another must, if
continued, bring about a period of
depression in mining activity, and
consequent hard times for those- de
pendent upon such industry for a
livelihood. Three properties have
been closed in the mother lode reg
ion within the past month, throwing
out of work between 300 and 400
men. The tendency for months past
has been to shut dowrn, rather than
to startup. The drift therefore is
in the direction of stagnation and
idleness, instead of a healthy ten
dency to open up new avenues for
the employment of labor. A re
action must come, otherwise the
working men will be face to face
with serious conditions in the labor
market ere long. It is easy to say,
if work cannot be found in one place,
it can in another. The field is large,
but where the same influences are
at work aJJ over the country, and
the same contraction of operations,
this process of reasoning is delusive.
Gompers advice to unions to quit
aggressive measures was sound, and
the members will consult their own
interests by giving heed to it.

in a peculiar way one day last week.
He was suporiutonding the placing of
a heavy timber in tho air compressor
room. Ono end had Inieu hoisted in
place, resting temporarily on a support
pending the securing of the other end.
While looking up, a movemorit of the
employes caused tho end to be dis
lodged, and it fell, striking Mr. Lynch's
right foot, breaking the bone and
crashing the foot badly. He was at
tended by thy local physician, but early
tins week went to San Francisco for
treatment.
While working in tho stopes at the

of tho law passed by the last legislature
affecting the compensation of justicos
and constables in this county, which is
now on appeal before Jbo' '.supremo
court, the following clauses form a part
of the findings of facts:
7th. That the salary provided for in
said act of legislature is not an increase
of the salary of petitioner after his
election and during his term of office,
but is merely a different mode adopted
by said- legislature of compensating
said ollicers, and is not in conflict with
Sec. 9 and 11 of the constitution of the
state of California.
. And the court further finds from tho
evidence introduced that respondent
has not proven that said act of tho
legislature increases the salary of peti
tioner after his election and during his
term of oßice. . ■

Alleged Fraudulent Mining Transaction.
Mrs. M. E. Odell, of 462 Twelth
street, San Francisco, is charged with
defrauding Arthur Lee of Kansas,
George W. Kent of Oregon, and George
~H. Horn of Nebraska, by false repre
sontation roncurninjj the valuo of some
alleged miuing ground in Amador
county. They were induced to invest
in property to the extent of $4500, as
follows: Lee $1100; Kent $1200, and
Horn $2200. The so-called mining
ground consists of 120 acres, in the vi
ciuity of Lock wood's station; indeed a
portioji-oT it was formerly included in
•ttteLockwood homestead, and pur
chased by Mrs. CXI oil from the home
stead claimant after Anal proof had
been offered. The land was filed on
for placer mining purposes after notice
of final proof had been given, and suit
was threatened against the homestead
settler. It was not considered of any
value for mining purposes by those who
ought to know, and the controversy
was settled by purchase for- a small
sum. The tract, consolidated with a
like tract held under the mining laws
constitutes the mining claim, the riches
of which so Sited the imaginations of
the throe men from three different
states as to get them to invest their
all in it. It is needless to say the mine
is a myth. The tenderfooted trio vis
ited the property and tried to uncover
its hidden treasures; but no matter
how hard they worked, or where they
worked, the gold failed to materialize.
The truth finally dawned upon them
that they were the victims of a gold
brick scheme, and have commenced
suit in San Francisco in a despairing
effort to get their money back.

Burbank Convicted.
The trial of Jack- Burbank for the
murder of Dora Streuber was concluded
in Redding last Friday, and resulted in
a verdict of murder in the second de
gree. It was a compromise verdict,
some of the jurors being in favor of the
higher crime. He was sentenced on
Monday. It is reported that Burbank
had everything arranged to hang him
self in his cell In the event of a verdict
of murder in the first degree. The
rope necessary to do this business was
found in his cell.
On Monday the judge sentenced him
to the extreme penalty provided by
law for the crime of which he was
found guilty — imprisonment for life;
the judge at the same time remarking
that the jury might under tho circum
stances have found him guilty of mur
der in tho first degree — without fixing
the penalty, which would have meant
hanging.

John Bonn, employed at the Zeila
mine, had a fall of 15 feet last Friday
while working in tho shaft. He was
engaged in landing timbers, when in
some way he went down the shaft.'
Fortunately, he landod on a board 15
feet below, otherwise the accident
would probably have had a fatal end
ing. As it was, he was considerably
bruised about the chest, and had to
place himself under the doctor's care
for several days.
Several weeks ago we published as a
part of the records in tho recorder's
office, an estray notice of certain hogs
in the possession of G. Tqnzi. The
Tonzi family live at Mt. Echo, and no
notice of tho kind having been sent to
the recorder's office by them, they
were at a loss to understand the mat
ter, or how to answer inquiries that
were made in relation thereto. The
explanation is that the name was in
correctly printed — it should have been
G. Tozl, not Tonzi.
William C. Johns, night boss at the
Zeila mine, went to San Francisco Mon
day morning, to go to a sanitarium
there for treatment for a badly injured
hand. While in the mine two weeks
ago, a piece of rock struck him on the
right hand, breaking and crushing the
little finger, and severely bruising the
hand. After some local treatment ho
was advised to go to tho city to have it
attended to. It is thought probable
that he may lose the little finger, but
the hand itself will most likely be saved.

THE SOUTH EUREKA STRIKE.
The following notice has been posted
up in Jackson and Sutter Creek, and
other points in tho county. Tho notice
Miners Take Notice. — You are here'
by notified that the South Eureka
mine has been declared unfair by the
Sutter Miners' Union, 133, W. F. of M.,
and you are requested to keep away.
Strike is now on. A. C. Malatasta,
Secretary; J. Pengelly, Pres.
No effort has been made by the com
pany to resume underground opera
tions. The mill is running, and there
is rock^on hand to keep it going for
another week or more. Tho engineers,
who are members of the American Fed
eration, are at work, keeping the prop
erty free from water. How long they
will be kept at work will depend upon
circumstances. It is said to be vital to
the working of tho Central Eureka" to
keep tho South Eur 1,.i drained. This
is where the seriousness of the proposi
tion comes in.
Tho correct story of how the strike
was brought about is given about as
follows, and differs from the accounts
heretofore published. It seems that
the skip tender is required to send up
water during the lunch hour. The
foreman, R. Mounter, noticed on the
day of the difficulty, that this was not
done, and upon speaking to the skip
tender about it, received a reply that
caused him to discbarge him then and
there. A few minutes thereafter, on
his return from some other duty, Mr.
Mounter found that water was being
sent up, and inquired who was doing it.
He found that the skip tender had re
sumed work, notwithstanding his being
notified to get hi.-- lime. Thereupon,
he bad to maintain his authority by
insisting upon his quitting. This
brought on the discharge of two others.
Tho union took up tho matter, and
wanted to know tho reasons, resulting
in all tho men being called out.
We understand the Sutter Creek
Union gave the company until Wed
nesday last to 'reinstate these men.
The company, we are told, refuses to
comply. It stands firm upon the prop
osition of its right to discharge with
out giving reasons therefor. It is not
to be assumed that an employe would
be discharged without reason: still it
is not advisable at all times to state the
reason. So the matter stands at present.
The kink-in thocable, and the refusal of
the men to be lowered in the compart
ment where this cable was used, were
incidents in the trouble. There were
also one or two other grounds of com
plaint by the men, but tho main cause
that led up to the shut-dowu was as
above stated.
The employes' version of the inci
dents leading up to the strike is ' some
what different. Several things, out
side of the discbarge of tho skip-tender
are brought in. It is said that the re
instatement of the skip-tender is not,
and was not, requested, but only the
other two men— who interceded iv bis
behalf at the time, and were discharged
by the superintendent. It was iv be
half of these that the union took up
the matter, claiming that there was no
sufficient reason for their dismissal.
Other side matters are also brought in
as grievances. It is fearod in some
quarters that the trouble may spread
and involve other mines in this sec
tion. This may coma in two ways,
either from a sympath«!tic action on
the part of the union employes of the
other mines, or the mine owners.
On Wednesday the strike situation
shifted somewhat. In the afternoon of
that day, we are reliably (informed, the
president of Sutter Crook Union, W.
F. M., called on Superintendent Geo.
W. Moore, at the office, and stated that
the men were ready to return to work.
Attached to this information was a
statement to the effect that the com
pany would be expected to deal with
the union hereafter and not directly
with the employes. To this proposi
tion the superintendent replied that he
would do nothing of tho kind;. that the
three discharged men would not be
taken back in any event. Also that all
the men on strike might consider them
selves discharged. If they desirod re
employmont, they must make applica
tion in their capacity as individuals and
not otherwise. This is how the matter
stood at last reports. It is hopod that
tho troublo will bo settled, and the
mine be placed' on a working basis
again.
New Safe at Amador Bank.
A now fire proof safe has boen in
stalled in the Bank of Amador County.
It was brought up from loao Wednes
day. It is of the Marvin- Hall make,
and weighs 4900 pounds. Tho safe
that has been doing service in tho bank
sinco its inauguration, is an old ono,
used in the Pacific Bank before its in
troduction hero, and whilo perfectly
good as far as its fire and burglar re
sisting qualities are concerned, its ma
chinery was worn and therefore it was
decided to secure ono of a more up-to
date pattern. The old safe will be
taken out of the vault, and sent below
in part exchange for the now ono.
Another Turn in the Frates Estate.
Another complication in the admin
istration of the estate of Frank Frates
has arisen this week in the application
for letters of guardianship of tho per
sons and estates of tho minor heirs by
Laura K. Mullen, aunt of the children.
This makes three applications now
pending for letters of admiqistration.
Besides this the administration of the
estate of Mrs. Frates— wife of tho do
ceased—is yet unsettled, and tho valid
ity of deeds issued under a suit to
create a trust in connection with that
administration, has been called in
question by a guarantee company in
San Francisco. All in all, the matter
is decidedly mixed,

MIXING NOTES.
Zeila.— The Zoila moves along at
its old-time gait. The mill is kept at
work steadily to its full capacity, and
everything about the mine and mill
runs smoothly. The mill produces
fully five tons of sulphurets per day.
The capacity of the chlorination works
is a trifle under four tons per day. So
that a large surplus of sulphurets has
accummulated — enough to run the
chlorination works for some weeks
without any further crushing of ore.
Kennedy. — The construction of the
additional stamps to the mill is making
satisfactory headway. The building is
being pushed ahead as rapidly as pos
sible, with the view of getting It cover
ed before severe weather sets in. Over
tho concentrator portion the roof is
covered," and in a few days it is expect
ed to start covering over tho batteries.
No machinery has been placed in posi
tion as yet, but the foundation work is
all completed. The new hoist is giving
some trouble. A stoppage of three
days was found necessary the latter
part of last week, to* fix some part
thereof. It was started again last
Monday. The expert machinist, rep
resenting the . Allis Chalmers Co., of
Chicago, the manufacturers of the
hoist, is still here, supervising the run
ning of the hoist.
HORN.— A meeting of this company
has been called for December 29, at the
office in San Francisco to consider the
proposition of increasing the capital
stock from $25,500 to $50,000, increas
ing the number of shares at the same
time from 100,000 to 200,000, the par
value* to remain the same— 2s cents per
share. The property is at a standstill
for lack of funds, and this increase of
capital stock is to raise money by the
sale of shares, to enable work in the
tunnel to be resumed, as it is believed
that another 100 feet at the outside will
carry the tunnel to the ledgo as reveal
ed by the outcroppings.

Uniform Bank Ball.
The second grand ball given by
Uniform Rank, K. of P., was held in
Love's hall last evening. It proved a
success from every, view point. There
was a large attendance; the weather
was all that could be desired; the
music was exceptionally good, being
furnished by Bowers' orchestra of
Stockton. The receipts were entirely
satisfactory, although theexact amount
is not yet known. The introductory
drill by the members of the organiza
tion was admirable, and helped to make
the affair the unqualified success that
it proved to be.

THIEVES AND OMENS.
Criminal* am a Rule Are the Sluvt-«
of Superstition.
Some of the most notorious criminals
who, it would hardly be thought, paid
the slightest attention to omens, good
ur bad, have the greatest faith in su
perstitions of all kinds.
The burglar Is a believer In the sig
nificance of dreams and has been
known to relinquish a big burgling feat
If a dreum the night before has warned
him that be will be In danger should he
disregard the warning. If he saw a
rainbow he would consider It to por
tend that, however reckless he may be,
he is not likely to fall into the hands
of the policy -for. a space of three
months. Burglars have been known to
carry a donkey's shoe In their pocket
before turning out, believing that this
will protect them from danger, while
others pin their faith to a piece of coal,
which they will carry in their pockets
throughout their career and afterward
bequeath it to a confederate.
The pickpocket Is equally supersti
tious. It Is said be will not rob a per
son who squints, this being accounted
a sign of disaster, and if it happens
that the purse he robs contains foreign
coins It is believed to augur that he
will travel a good deal In the immedi
ate future, whether in the company of
a couple of officers or not there is noth
ing to show. s
Weddings and funerals are pregnant
with meaning for the professional thief.
To pick a pocket at a funeral would be
to court immediate disaster, whereas if
a purse stolen at a wedding contains
gold it portends the best of luck for
the thief during the ensuing six months.
Some pickpockets have a favorite
pair of boots that they wear as long as
they can keep them on their feet, and
If they are not arrested while they are
wearing them they cut the boots up
Into little square pieces and give them
away as "lucky tokens" to their pals.
THE EYES.
Black or very dark eyes denote a ca
pacity for extreme ardor in love.
Greenish tints in blue or hazel eyes
are the signs of wisdom and courage.
Steel colored eyes usually denote a
cold nature, also deceit and treachery.
Russet brown eyes, untinged by yel
low, mean an affectionate and gentle
disposition.
Dark blue eyes, while Indicating af
fection and purity, do not represent in
tellectuality. '. .\
Variable gray eyes are highly intel
lectual and Indicative of an impulsive
and impressionable temperament.
Clear light blue eyes, especially If ac
companied by steadfastness of expres
sion, denote cheerfulness, amiability
and constancy.
Tawny eyes denote fickleness. Eyes
of no particular color, only feeble
shades of gray, and blue, go with lym
phatic dispositions, characterized by
coldness, selfishness and Ilstlessness.
A Vat* Sapper.
A very steady and serious country
gentleman had joined a newly estab
lished London west end club which of
fered the advantage of bedrooms for
country members temporarily in town.
When next the squire visited the mod
ern Babylon he put up for the night at
the club, which had In the meantime
become extremely fashionable and its
hours correspondingly Irregular. The
squire went to bed at an early hour,
when all was quiet and decorous. If
there were a racket in the night he
slept through it.
Next morning he came down to
breakfast at his usual hour, 8 o'clock,
but was surprised to find the room In
the middle of the dusting process and
not a cloth on the tables. While be was
gazing helplessly around a sleepy eyed
waiter came up to him.
"I beg your pardon, sir," he said apol
ogetically, "but no suppers can be
served after half past 7."— London Tit-
Bits.
Our Animals.
A dish of fresh water Is a constant
necessity where there Is a dog or a cat,
even though they never appear to touch
It Offering them water now and then
doesn't answer at all.
Those who suppose a cat requires only
meat and milk should offer it a bit of
nicely cooked vegetable, especially as
paragus, corn, green beans or potato. :
It Is criminal to keep caged pets un
less one Is sure to remember their
needs, not when one "thinks of It," but
constantly.
The man who has no tender feelings
for his horse should remember that
this faithful servant will last longer
and serve better while he does last if
he receive consistent treatment.

IN THE WAKE OF A
SIDE COMB
SYLVIA LEE
Copyright, 1003, by T. C. McCliire
When the girl one loves as one has
never loved before throws her arms
about one's necfe and says, "And I
think it would be so lovely to have
diamond side combs instead of a soli
taire, if you don't -mind, deaf," and
blushes-
Well, one buys the side combs with
out a question, and later perhaps one
reflects. But then It's too late.
It thus befell with Harkness, and
Leda wore the two starry bands so
deftly posed amid the knotted tangles
of her sunny curls that they suggested
a diadem and in nowise led any man
to the conclusion which time honored
custom has drawn from the solitaire.
In fact, before the betrothal was a
week old Harkness himself began to
wonder.
And when, at a dance at the Lake
side club, young Wrycroft, the very
famous half back, invited Leda to go
out for a moonlight row around the
pier with him and Leda accepted and
went Harkness not only wondered, but
grit his teeth as well. No man who
has spent ten years dancing attend
ance on other men's fiancees and other
men's wives is going to enjoy life
while his own personal fiancee and
future wife is off with a fellow whose
namu lias headed newspaper columns
and whose chest can hardly find space
for all his medals. The couple were
gone an hour and seven minutes by a
watch which had come down through
three generations of the Harkness fam
ily, and when they did reappear the
owner of the watch stood at the head
of the wide stair and claimed the
young lady for the next waltz. Wry
croft, happily oblivious to his crime,
strolled off, and Harkness led the girl
around the wide promenade to a place
which was quiet and retired enough
for private conversation. He was boll
ing within, but nothing" could have
been more sweetly calm than the way
In which he put his arm about her and
asked with careless placidity:
"Did j-ou row far, dear?"
"I didn't row at all,'.' said Leda. "He
rowed."
Harkness kissed her with exceeding
gentleness. ' "Did you land anywhere,
darling— on the Point, for Instance?"
"N-u-u-o," said Leda. .
Harkness passed his finger over her
pretty hair in silence for a few min
utes, and then he suddenly gave a
sharp exclamation:
"Good God, Leda, you've lost one of
your combs!"
Leda put both hands to her head and
almost shrieked as -she realized the
truth.
'Terhaps you forgot to put one in?"
said her lover.
, "No; I had them lwth, I'm sure."
She began to cry. Harkness scratched
matches, and they both looked all over
the floor, but not a diamond glittered
in the general gloom of the hour.
Very much later in the evening while
Harkness was twostepplng with Mrs.
Lancaster a sudden turn showed him
Leda speaking earnestly .to Wrycrcft
Wrycroft looked terribly used up, and
Harkness smiled grimly.
"Oh, what a smile!" said Mrs. Lan
caster. "It's both impressive and
frightening. You make me afraid of
you, and yet the smile."
Hark ness \vondered if he wasn't a
fool to be contemplating the addition
of another wife to the assemblage.
"You look like a cross between Meph
istophelcs and Machiavelli," went on
Mrs. Lancaster, who was slender and
never lost her breath. "Which do you
favor?"
"I can't spell either," replied Hark
ness shortly, ne felt inclined to join
the next expedition to the north pole.
The dance endured exceedingly late.
It was quite 3 "when the last woman
retired, and a half dozen men were
still lounging on the piazzas when the
first gray streaks of dawn appeared
above the Point. Harkness sprang up
when he perceived them and yawned
vigorously.
"I'm going to bed," lie declared, "and
I shall not tarry long upon the order
of my sleeping, either."
Young "Wrycroft stood up, too, and
passed his hand over his forehead..
"I don't feel very fit," he said slowly.
"I believe I'll go for a little row and
maybe take a dip from the Point."
Ho went down the steps as Harkness
entered the h«use. Later curiosity led
the latter to wander to the window and
look to see if Wrycroft was really car
rying out his purpose.
A rowboat lay on the sandy stretch
opposite, and the rosy light of the ris
ing sun illumined a figure which paced
restlessly up and down the rustic paths
skirting the shore.
"I shouldn't callthat exactly swim
ming?" said Harkness to himself a lit
tle grimly. He pulled down the shade
with a violent jerk and got Into bed.
It was quite noon when he awoke.
The day was glorious, and the bosom
of the lake was dotted with sailing
parties. He gave the bell two punches
for hot water and twfsted the dressing
case toward the window as a prelimi
nary to shaving. The mirror reflected
the Point, and as Harkness started to
tip it he saw a girl disembarking alone.
He unhung his field glasses.
Yes, it was Leda!
He threw the glasses on the bed and
went on with his toilet
Bvery one was at luhcheon when be
went down, and as he stopped by
Leda's chair to remind her that she
was to drive out with him at 3 he

could not help seeing how .wretched
she looked. Her hair bore no sign of
side comb.
When they went out later there
seemed to be a species of shadow mix
ed with the preliminary silence.
The man spoke first (and he waited
a good while).
"You haven't found it, have you?"
"Oh, dear, no."
"Don't you think perhaps it. t ell out
in the boat?"
"Why, there was nothing in the boat
to loosen it" x
Flarkncss felt the corners of his
mouth suddenly give way even while
his temper rose. \ He looked off to the
right for a long minute and then asked
severely:
"Was there anything at the Point to
loosen it?"
Leda's mouth flew open in undis
guised fright
"Who told you we were to . the
Point?"
"I knew it all the time."
She began to cry.
"I never will again, truly."
"How could you behave so?" said the
lover, launching himself suddenly into
the full tide of his righteous wrath.
"You put me beyond all patience; go-
Ing off like that with Wrycroft when
you know perfectly well that you be
long to some one else, and then actually
letting him"—
Leda seized his arm.
"Only once," she protested earnestly,
"only once."
"Once is once too often," said Hark
ness, a great and exceeding bitterness
welling up In his tone. "Once is a great,
great many times too often, consider
ing the situation. Now, Leda, listen to
me," he continued sternly. "Either
promise me that you will never, never
again do anything in the slightest de
gree questionable or we'll call it all off,
and you can give, me back the comb -,
that you still have.". .
"Oh, I'll promise!" said Leda, with a
submissive choke. "I'll never, never do
so again. Truly, truly. Upon my word
and honor."* -. • . V,
Harkness looked to the right and
left and behind. Then he leaned down
and kissed her. . .
Leda smiled happily, almost . forget
ting the side comb. -.."-.. .
. "She's a dear little girl," said her
lover, and,' taking all the driving appa
ratus into his right hand, he thrust the
left into his breast pocket and drew
forth the missing comb.
Leda screamed.
"Oh, where did you find it?"
"I didn't find it anywhere," he said
coolly, as he adjusted the reins again.
"I took It out of your hair myself last

A' Dog's Fidelity.
- In the upper part of the famous Se
quatchlc. valley," in east Tennessee, a
man and his wife settled when the
country was new and wild. One of the
first crops that they raised was a con
siderable Aeld of cotton. When it was
ready to be. picked, they went out to
gether, prepared to make a holiday out
of this pleasant labor. Their one baby
was left in a cradle at the edge of the
field, and the faithful old dog was
instructed to watch the tiny sleeper.
After a considerable time they looked
toward the cradle to see If all was well
there. They were startled by the dis
covery that the little couch had been
turned completely over. The dog was
making queer dives underneath and
yelping as if in anger. As they hasten
ed to the place they were horrified to
find the animal's jaws covered with
blood and instantly came to the con
clusion that he had been rending the
child with his teeth. ;
The angry father hit the animal a
deathblow with a cudgel and then
hastily turned the cradle right side, up.
There was the baby all unharmed, and
there in the bedding was an enormous
rattlesnake, killed by the faithful dog
after a fierce fight in which both com
batants had received many wounds.— •

dans That Saved Lives.
Guns have plenty of uses apart from
killing. For instance, the signal gun
of a ship is intended solely for an
nouncing her arrival on a coast. Again,
in desert countries, where water Is
often difficult to collect out of a mere
dampness of sand, a gun barrel, sunk
Into the ground will collect moisture
in the bore, and many a life has been
saved by a timely suck at the muzzle.
Minute guns are fired ■ for • public
mourning, and national rejoicings take
the form of a royal salute.
A slaver captured with" a cargo of
slaves in the tropics was put in charge
of a prize crew. On her voyage the wa
ter ran short, and the slaves, slavers
and prize crew were dying of thirst.
This set one of the marines, a sergeant,
thinking, and he hit upon a brilliant
Idea.
After ' regaining reluctant consent
from the captain he took all the availa
ble gun barrels, plugged up the breech
ends of a few of them, filled their bores
with sea water and set them end up
among the coals of the galley fire. As
the steam rose he ran it through other
gun barrels until it got cool. The cool-
Ing steam collected in the shape of ex
cellent fresh water, of which he pro
cured a steady though small supply.—

WHALES AS THEY DIVE.
Something About the Habits of the
Ocean Monatcrx.
Both whalers and naturalists have
usually held that when whales "sound"
they descend to great . depths, says
Knowledge. One writer on the subject
estimates that the larger members of
the group dive fully a thousand yards.
In a memoir published In Belgium Dr.
Bacovltza challenges this belief and
states that In his opinion 100 yards is
the maximum depth to which any
Whale can dive and that many species
cannot reach anything like that limit
Says the writer: '-^_
" Why should whales want to "ga_to
such depths? AH whales sound for the
purpose of obtaining food, and In the
profound darkness of 1,000 yards what
• food could they get? Those species
which feed on animalcules might, per
haps, obtain what they want But how
about the species which feed on fishes
and cuttles? At a depth of 1,000 yards'
they certainly could not use their eyes
to detect nonluminous species, and we
have no evidence whatever that they
feed on the self luminous deep sea fish
and cuttles, If, indeed, there be any of
the latter. On the contrary, the available
evidence indicates that they feed on
ordinary light dwelling fishes and cut
tles which live In much shallower
zones. But this is not all. It is known
that the effects of a pressure of more
than three atmospheres prove fatal to
human life; and, although we may be
lieve that whales can stund treble this
pressure, or nine atmospheres, which
would occur at about ninety j yards'
depth, is it. conceivable that could
resist the effect of ten times the latter
pressure, or ninety atmospheres? More
over, does it seem possible that a whale
whose body is only slightly . heavier
than water at ordinary pressure could
exert the muscular force necessary to
propel that body to a depth of 1,000
yards? • • ;
COLD WAVES.
They Purify the Atmosphere and
Benefit the Hainan System.
The cold wave, so much dreaded by
most people, is really a blessing in dis
guise. It charges the atmosphere with
fresh oxygen and a - surplus of free
electricity, which produces a most ex
hilarating ■ and beneficial effect upon
mankind. Torpid energies are aroused,
physical vigor and resistance increased,
by the advent of a cold wave to sucli
an extent that any Incidental damage
is more than made up for.
The American climate has always
been recognized as a strong factor In
causing the aggressiveness and enter
prise which have lifted our people intc
the first rank among nations and made
us commercially supreme.- The cold
wave, with Its results of increased en
ergy and vigor, Is a meteorological phe
nomenon peculiar to this country. Tin
chief of the weather bureau at Wash
ington explains the origin of this wave
It appears that with a high pressure
system, rotating with great velocity
large volumes of cold air are drawt
down from above the clouds, so thai
the cold wave is v "homemade," beinf
simply a product of motion. The sys
tern of motion originates in the north
west but the cold air comes fron
above the clouds.
The cold wave is not only useful foi
its beneficial effect upon the humai
system, but as a cleansing and purify
ing agency. It dissipates the deadly
carbonic acid gas, the product of respi
ration and combustion, and the foul ef
fluvia of decaying matter, Increasing
atmospheric circulation generally am
thereby relieving stagnation.— Medica
