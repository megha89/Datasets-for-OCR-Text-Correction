INGENIOUS TORTUREB.
Craeltlea of Panlahnirnt Inflicted o»
Offenders In Morocco.
In Morocco the torture of offenders,
real and suspected, has been and is
Btlll much practiced. Much ingenuity
is shown In the infliction of pain— such
devices as the rubbing of red pepper in
to the eyeballs, tying np the wrists at
a height from the ground, etc.
At the death of the late sultan a pre
tender proclaimed himself the rightful
heir to the throne and had a certain
success. When presently overcome by
the legitimate authorities, he was
seised, thrown down, when chillies
were applied to the inside of his mouth
till -It swelled with pain, and he was
desired to shout out his titles and qual
ities as much as be pleased, being of
course unable to utter a word. After
that be was thrown into Jail to rot there
till he died.
A refinement of cruelty Is the torture
of the "iron glove," as it is called. A
lump of quicklime is placed in a man'B
hand, which Is closed up 'lnto a fist.
Then the flat is tightly ■ bound with
leather thongs and plunged Into a tub
of cold water.
• The agony soon becomes extreme.
The torture is continued for eight or
ten days until in the end mortification
ensues and probably death. Again, a
form of "lying up" is to chain or fasten
a man to a wall, with his arms extend
ed so that he can only escape strangu
lation by standing on tiptoe.— Kansas
City Independent
A Ral'i Teeth.
The rat Is remarkably well equipped
for the peculiar life he Is ordained to
lead. He has strong weapons la the
shape of four long and very sharp
teeth— two In the npper Jaw and two
in the lower. These teeth are wedge
shaped and by a wonderful provision
of nature have always a fine, sharp
cutting edge. On examining them care
fully the Inner part Is found to be of a
soft, lvoryllke composition, which can
easily be worn away, and the outside
is composed of a glassllke enamel
which Is exceedingly hard.
The upper teeth work into the under
so that the centers of the opposed teeth
meet perfectly hi the act of gnawing;
hence the soft part is being continually
worn away, while the hard pnrt keepa
a hard, chlsel-Ilke edge all the time, and
at the same time the teeth are con
stantly growing up from the bottom, so
that as they wear away a fresh supply
is ready. Should one of these teeth be
removed by accident or otherwise, the
opposing tooth will continue to grow,
and there* being nothing to wear It
away it will project from the mouth
and be turned upon Itself, and if Jt be
an under tooth it will often grow bo
long as to penetrate the skull.

turned to parliament as would prove
submissive to the royal will of King
James I. The three chief undertakers
of 1614 were Lords Bacon, Somerset
and Neville. They undertook to bribe
the chief speakers and men of influ
ence in parliament that year over to
the side of the king, with but partial
Biiccess. Then there were undertakers
In Ireland in 1008. They were English
and Scotch colonists sent to north Ire
land and were each allotted 2,000 acres
of land. They were men of capital and
undertook to pay a mark a year for
every six acres and to admit no recu
sant for tenants. Hence the name as
applied to them. But neither the his
tories nor the dictionaries give any rea
son for calling the men who bury our
dead undertakers.
Almost Lived There.
During a burglary epidemic In the
country an Inspector of the police force
one nlgbt made a tour through the bur
glarized district. Considerably after
midnight he saw a young man emerge
noiselessly from a substantial home
stead and made after him.
"Did you Just come out of that cor
ner bouse?" the Inspector asked, over
hauling him.
The young man, while of respectable
appearance, was plainly 111 at ease and
confused.
"I did," he said.
"Do you live there?" demanded the
Inspector. ; . ■•^.'..
"Well, almost," was the embarrassed
answer. "But I can't see that it's any
of your business as long as her father
doesn't object"— London Tit-Bits.
'Where Gannets Swarm.
One of the most remarkable sights In
the world is Bird Island, In South Afri
ca, for the reason that during some
months of the year it Is literally cov
ered with gannets. Not a foot of ground
Is to be seen anywhere. Day after day
thousands of gannets strut around, and
they are so close to each other that the
jvliole Island seems actually ' alive.
Those who have seen this sight say
that It Is one which can never be for
guiten.

BOER LANGUAGES.
The Different Klnda o« Dntch Spoken
In Sonth Africa. ,^ -..
It seems a strange thing to say, but
there are " three 1 Dutch' j languages In
South Africa. The earliest Dutch set
tlers at the Cape were largely Dutch
sailors and others belonging to the low
er orders of Amsterdam, Rotterdam
and other Dutch seaports. Their lan
guage was a low Dutch" dialect to bfr^
gin with, and although the sprinkling
of Dutch officers at the Cape their
best to preserve the lnngtsige of the
Netherlands they, couiil ; .not prevent
the dialect of the settlers from v still
further degenerating Into a mere collo
quial, patois. Its degeneration was
doubth-sM largely brought about by do
mestic servants and slaves—Hotten
tots, Malays and Mozambique ICalUrs—
who spoke it very Imperfectly and in
troduced into it m«fiy strange words
and idioms. This, then, is the genesis
of what Is variously known as "Cape
Dutch," "Kitchen Dutch," "Patriot
Dutch," "Afrikaans" and "Afrikander
Taal." Its basis Is Dutch, but the
nouns have lost their declensions and
the verbs their conjugations, while
grammatical gender and syntax gener
ally have gone by the board. To the
educated Hollander of today it Is a lit
erary atrocity, and he cannot away
with it, but to the Afrikander it is his
mother tongue, the language of his
home and his childhood, the exponent
of all that he knows of humor and
pathos. It is full of expressive idioms,
pithy proverbs and pawky expressions,
like those so dear to the lowland Scot,
and yet It is not a language, for it has
no literature.
The second of the three Dutch lan
guages referred to might be called "ec
clesiastical Dutch," or, if you like, Af
rican Dutch. It is the language of Hol
land as that language was ; written
about 200 years ago. It is the language
of the Dutch Bible and very much re
sembles our, own authorized version in
its simplicity ■ and directness of style.
It Is the language of the Dutch psalm
and Gesang books and of. the devotion
al works of old Dutch divines, which
make up', the balance of the Dutch
farmers' literature." In it are also writ
ten many tracts and a few. devotional
works by living ministers of the Dutch
Reformed church. To the Boer wherev
er you find him it is the language of
his church and of his religion. This is
the Dutch language which the leaders
of the Dutch Afrikander party are de
termined to preserve. It Isiiever epo
ken by Afrikanders among themselves,
however, and it Is never written gnun
matically by them In their correspond
ence. The Boer has no fear that his
"Huls-taal," Cope Dutch, will die out,
but fears that his children will forget
or neglect to learn the language of his
church and of his forefathers.
The third Dutch language might be
called modern literary or "high Dutch"
— that---""-*- 1 --'-'
"spoken by educated Hollanders of to
day. It is florid, Involved in construc
tion and very artificial in style as com
pared with the language of the Dutch
Bible. . Its pronunciation has also
changed considerably In the interval,
and even an educated Dutch speaking
Afrikander listening to a voluble Hol
lander can hardly make head or tail
of what he is saying. — Scotsman.
A Legend About Cat*.
The ancient Greeks thought that all
creatures except cats had souls and
that that animal lost Its soul through a
bargain made between a bridge archi
tect and the devil. The architect had
besought the devil to get his help in
constructing an exceedingly dangerous
bridge structure, and his Satanic maj
esty only consented to lend aid on con
dition that the first creature to cross It
should lose its soul.
This was agreed upon, the bridge
finished in due time and the devil sent
to the opposite aide to await his prey.
The shrewd architect took good care to
send a cat over before any human be
ing was allowed to cross. On learning
of the bargain the cat recrossed the
bridge and scratched the architect's
eyes out
Naming a Town.
According to a local tradition, proba
bly Invented, Sayville, N. V., received
its name In a peculiar fashion. The
settlers were gathered In debate upon
the shore, trying to agree upon a name
for the place, and one after another
proposed his suggestion with, "Say,
how '11 this do?" After many sugges
tions had been rejected some one bar
ren of imagination but sensitive of ear
proposed that the oft repeated word
"Say" be made the first syllable of the
name and that "vllle" be added as the
second syllable. The Idea took, and,
says the legend, then and there the
settlement .was christened Sayville.

CHARLOTTE . CU6H MAN.
Bitter Undies; of tie One Love Affair
of the Famous Aetreaa.
V Charlotte Cushmon, the actress, was
in lore but once In her Mfe. She met In
Cincinnati, wbe^e she was playing, an
actor named Clark, with whom she fell
In love. Through her efrorts Clark was
advanced to leading man In the com
pany, and the course of" true lore ran
smoothly. ;■ .
One nlgbj the actress met a strange
woman behind the scenes between the
acts. ;vi^ ■•"
The woman came up to her and ad
dressed her thus:
"You an Charlotte Custiman, the
great actrwc Haven't you got enough
men to admire you without coming be
tween man and wife and robbing me
of my husband?" =-, ;
; "Your husband r cried Miss OUBh
nwn, getting excited.
'• -^Tes, and you have taken or you are
trying to take him from me," contin
ued the ragged woman, looking Miss
Cushman full In the face. " v
"Who is your husband?"
"Conrad Clark," replied the woman,
"the father of this child." pointing to a
half starved, thin little child in her
arms.
Miss Cushman started as If she had
been shot
She went through her part that night
as usual—acted It splendidly— brought
down the bouse; then, after the per
formance, she sent for Clark to come to
her dressing room. Clark knocked and
then opened the door. She brought for
ward to him his wife and baby, who
had been waiting In the dressing room
to receive him.
. Such a reception! Charlotte Cushman
never looked or acted so grandly on the
stage In all her life as she did that
night In her dressing room. She waved
Clark away with a greater majesty
than ever as Queen Catherine she
wared away Cardinal Wolsey, and then
going to her hotel probably she had a
good crying spell.
- But she never loved again.

Pedigree* of Arabian Horaea.
The Arabs have no - written pedi
grees. It. is all an, affair fof. memory
and of notoriety. In the tribe. Certain
alleged pedigrees of Arabian horses,
couched in romantic language and rep
resented as carried in a small bag and
hung by a cord around the anlmaPs
neck, have been published, but these
are forgeries got up probably by bone
dealers, Egyptian, Syrian or Persian.
The breeding of every horse is a mat
ter of common knowledge, and It
would be Impossible for his owner to
fabricate pedigree so as to deceive the
natives, even if he were so inclined.
The . Bedouins, It seems necessary to
admit are in general great liars, and
they will He (to a stranger) about tha
age, the qualities or the ownership of
a horse, but they will not lie about his
pedigree, even .when they can-do so
with impunity. To be truthful on this
subject Is almost a matter of religion,
certainly a point of honor in the des
ert—Atlantic.
Animals That Deltuht to Play. '
In animals the faculty of amusement
awakes very early. Our four footed
friends seem to be aware of this and
make it a part of their parental duties
to amuse their young. A ferret will
play with her kittens, a cat with hers,
a dog with her puppies. A mare .will
play with her foal, though the .writer
has never seen a cow try to amuse her
calf nor any birds their young. If their
mothers do not amuse them, the young
ones Invent games of their own.—Lon

The Coldness of Space.
Away out In space is a cold so intense

beyond our atmosphere. And night and
day, summer and winter, this insati
ate space Is robbing us of our heat and
fighting { with demoniac power to re

IN BORROWED PLUMAGE.
Well Dressed Women Wko Wear
Goods Seat on Approval.
When the ways of some women are
considered, it Is less remarkable that
such numbers of women dwelling Is
the large cities dress extravagantly
than before their methods of securing
rich costumes for all occasions hay©
been scrutinized.
There are women, and many of them
very wealthy, who make a regular
practice of having elegant garments
sent to their homes on approval, wear-
Ing them once and then returning them
to stores or costumefB. Some women
will wear a dress or a cloak to the
opera and send it back next morning.
Or they will get a hat or wrap and go
driving or visiting in it The average
person would be astonished to know all
the things, from handsome umbrellas
a<id fans of great beauty to Jewelry
and clothes, that some women bor
row from the shops.
Of course all of these women are not
well off, but they all dress well and
go out a great deal, and although the
shopkeepers often discover the manner
in which they are being deceived, they
do not always like to make a fuss for
fear of losing a good customer. Besides
they know that if they incur the enmi
ty of such impostors the women are
quite capable of abusing their goods
and robbing them of other and more
honest customers. Strange as it may
seem, these women generally mingle la
pretty good society, or the fringes of It
and have some Influence in the matter
of dress, since they have won the repu
tation of always dressing elegantly and
In the newest things.
This sort of Imposition had been car
ried on so often by a customer of a cer
tain large firm that its members deter
mined to put a stop to her flaunting
about in borrowed plumage, at least
when the plumage belonged to them.
One Saturday this woman had a splen
did wrap sent home on approval, and
on Sunday one of the head clerks of
the firm who knew Mrs. Blank as the
offender stationed himself near her
pew in the fashionable church which
she attended. When she sailed down
the aisle after service, resplendent in
the borrowed cloak, this man stepped
up to her and said:
"How do you do, Mrs. Blank? I am
delighted to see that you like our cloak
well enough to keep it."
Of course after that she could not re
turn the cloak.
8011, with all the efforts put forward
by shops and costumers to break up
the pernicious habit of forcible borrow
ing on the part of sundry feminine cus
tomers, the practice goes merrily on,
and many a fair dame with an envi
able reputation for exquisite dressing
appears but once In garments and hats
that when next seen are bedecking an
other woman or hanging In the show
room of eome smart shop—Washington
Barred Out immigrant!.
Uncle Sam has a black list of birds
and quadrupeds which it is absolutely
prohibited to introduce into this coun
try, says the Chattanooga Times. The
mongoose, the flying fox and the star
ling are on the list The mongoose Is a
species of ferret a native of India,
where It is domesticated as a sort of
animal rat trap and snake destroyer.
It was Introduced Into Jamaica to get
rid of the sugar cane rats. These ex
terminated, however, the mongoose

1 cents
Eight cents a pound is
what a young woman paid for
twelve pounds of flesh. *
She was thin and weak and
paid one dollar for a bottle of
Scott's Emulsion, and by tak-
ing regular doses had gained
twelve pounds in weight before
the bottle was finished.
Eight cents a pound is
cheap for such valuable ma-
terial. Some pay more, some
less, some get nothing for
their money. You get your
moneys worth .when you buy

WHEN BTARCH WAS NEW.
It Csed to Be Made In Colors So as to
Tint the Fabric.
"A package of starch?'; asked the In
telligent and learned grocer, and as he
wrapped the package up be talked.
"Starch originated," he said, "in
Flanders. It ,was Introduced into Eng
land, with the big ruff, in the time of
Queen Elizabeth. It was like our starch
of today, except that it was made in
colon— red, yellow, green, blue. Tb#
effect of this was to tint delicately the
white linen to which the starch might
be applied.'; -. r . - , s -^ » •> -r.a^'.j ■!. .■■_.--:.•.
"Before Queen Elizabeth's time ruf
fles and raffs iwero made of fine hoi
land,' .which required . n0 ... stiffening.
Then the raffs of cambric enrne, and
these must of necessity, be starched."
The grocer, consulting his memoran
dum book, resumed:
"It is recorded that '.when the queen
had ruffs made of. lawn and cambric
for her own princely wearing there was
none in | England could tell how to
starch them; but the queen made spe
cial means. for some women that could
starch, and Mrs. Guliham, wife of the
royal coachman, was the first starch
er/
"In 1664 a Flanders woman,' Frau
Van der Flame, came to London and
established . there a school for . the
teaching of starching. The school suc
ceeded, j . The , Flanders frau got rich.
She charged £5 a lesson. and an extra
20 shillings for a recipe for the making
of starch out of wheat flour, bran and
roots. ■• •- — ■ •■ -■ -• ■ ■
"Yellow - was the - most fashionable
color In starch among the nobility. The
Puritans used blue starch, though at
first they had been against the stuff al
together, dabbing it 'a certalne kinde of
llqulde matter which they call starch,
.wherein- the devil hath willed them to
wash and Ulvo^ their ruffes, which,
when they be dry, will then stand stiffe

The reason why the sheriff of New
York cannot be elected to two succes

duty to carry out the process of courts
against official delinquents during trial
and after conviction. Should a sheriff
endeavor forcibly to bold j over i for . a
second time after having been defeated
for re-election he. would be. the instru
ment of the court's process 'against
himself, a paradoxical position which
the law avoids by making him ineligi

RUSSIA'S MARCH TO THE SEA.
Russia's determination, as evi
denced by recent diplomatic cor
respondence with China, to retain
its grip npon Manchuria, will cause
a protest from i the several powers
interested, and that is about all.
Manchuria is a large province form
ing the north-eastern portion of the
Chinese empire. It embraces an
area of 370,000 square miles. A
better idea of its extent may be
gained perhaps by saying that it is
as large as California, Arizona and
Nevada combined. And this vast
territory the insiatiable Russian
Bear proposes to gobble up with
little ceremony. During the Boxer
troubles in China Russia took ad
vantage of circumstances, and
placed strong military guards at
strategic points throughout Man
churia under the plea of protecting
its railroad lines— then in course of
construction through that land.
Manchuria lies in the direct line of
Russian expansion south and east.
Russia wants it not merely because
-it is an important step . toward se
curing an open port on the Yellow
sea, but also because it is contiguous
to her vast Siberian possessions. For
hundreds of years this latter reason
has been sufficient to cause the great
northern power to annex territory.
It matters not whether the land be
a desert, inhospitable and uninhab
itable, if it borders on Russian terri
tory that in itself is deemed suffici
ent cause for its absorption. And
wherever Russia plants its standard,
a'npop— iwtor," n iidß kftk 1 ttnrpov&Vj
abode, but to stay. Only once since
she started out in her wonderful
. career of conquest and expansion
has she parted with territory. That
was in the case of Alaska, which she
disposed of to the United States. It
was separated from her other pos
sessions by Behring sea. Alaska
was outside her sphere of influence;
in a different world as it were. She
could not reach it by land, and to
protect and develop it by sea was
not in accordance with her tradi
tions. So she surrendered it for a
price. Since then, however, she has
added to her dominions an . area
many times the extent of her former
American possessions. This latest
grab of Manchuria is more than half
as large as Alaska. The United
States with other commercial nations
is interested in this Manchurian
seizure, inasmuch aa it violates the
open door policy guaranteeing equal
trade privileges to all. Russia is
an adept in overcoming, such dif
ficulties. She will pacify these
countries by promising special trad
ing concessions. A narrow strip of
Corea now remaius between Russia
and the seaboard facing Japan.
Japan takes this latest move of
Russia to heart more than any other
nation. It affects her more than
any other power. It means, Russia
as the paramount power on the sea
board fronting Japan. This is not
to the liking of the latter nation,
which is not enamoured with Russia
as a neighbor. Japan is a naval and
military power not to be despised
even by the Colossus of the North.
Single handed, she is no match for
.Russia, at any rate not in a military
sense. From a naval standpoint
Russia is vastly superior also in
battleships. Neither nation has
much history in the way of accom
plishments on the sea to boast of.
Japan, it is true, acquitted herself
well, both on land and sea, in her
recent contest with China. Russia
is absolutely without a naval record
with modern war vessels. Without
assistance from one or more of the
great powers, it is hardly probable
that Japan will do more than pro
test against the pushing of the
Russian frontier to the sea coast.
The Calaveras Prospect thinks
Amador county is making a great
ado about a trifle in the prominence
given to the change made by the last
legislature in giving constables and
justices of the peace a salary in
place of fees in criminal business. A
similar law was passed relative to
Calaveras county, but our cotem
porary says it is generally under
stood that the law does not become
effective until after the present of
ficial term expires. With that
understanding the main cause for
objection, is removed. The constitu
tional barrier falls, and the only ques
tion that remains is the wisdom of
the change. We do not know how
it may strike the taxpayers of Cala
veras county, but the citizens of
Amador are not disposed to look at
a law which imposes »n additional
burden of $20,000 in four years as a
small matter. It is just such "small"
matters that make the aggregate of
taxation burdensome. The lax rate
in our sister county is now 20 cents
less than in Amador. The question
therefore has not reached that acute
stage there that it has with us.
However, if laws which tend to
jump the running expenses thous
ands of dollars a year are treated as
of little interest to the press or to
the taxpayers, even though the in
crease takes effect four years hence,
our rich neighbor will "get there"
in due time.

ger and Ross Moon stood up with the
couple and added grace and dignity to
tbe impressive ceremony. The bride
was handsomely attired in a beautiful
dress of white crepe de chene trimmed
in peau de soie and aplique. The newly
married couplo are very popular among
the young people of Jackson, and both
are prominent in the local parlors of Na
tive Sons and Daughters of the Golden
West. The bride is president of Ursula
Parlor No. 1, and the groom is tbe first

Good cheer was the sentiment of the
hour, - enlivened by music and song.'
Light refreshments were served. The

Break in the Wire.
Last Wednesday afternoon the elec
tric wire of the Standard Company
was cut near the substation just below'
town b.y a flying; rock from a blast, set
off by the rjosd .ereiir. The broken
wire carrying 10,000 volts fell to the
ground and for a few moments made
things lively. The pole was set on fire
and the rock and earth about the fallen
wire were quickly melted into lava and
fused into a solid glassy substance.
The telephone was affected and most
of tbe fuses burned out. Word was
telegraphed to the plant, and the cur
rent shut .off as soon as possible. There
was no wire in town to repair the line,
but Thos. Burrow drove py.er from
Sutler Creek in two hours with the
necessary supplies. The line was re
paired and the lights on about nine
o'clock. — Calaveras Prospect.
Improvements.
The Ginocchio residence is being
decorated with a coat of paint. W.
W. piummer, assisted by Dick Angove,
is doing tha work..
S. Myers is having the front of b. is
store titivated with paint.
W. Tarn has made a decided improve
ment at his residence. He got tired of
repairing the picket fence in front of
the dwelling, and has had a substantial
concrete and stone wall built, with con
crete steps and walk to the front door.
Upon the concrete wall will be built a
neat fence. The change adds much to
the appearance of the property.
The Freeman Estate Company have
made an excavation in the rear of their
store the past week, in order to pro
vide room for the storage of oils and
other articles.
Hotel Netherland.
The advertisement of the Hotel
Netherland of San Francisco will bo
found in another column of the Ledger.
We do not hesitate to recommend this
popular hotel to the people of Amador
county who make occasional visits to
tho city. The proprietors, Chris
Schmidt and Chas. A. Phillips, are well
known young men of Sacramento, and
are personally known to the Ledger,
and we can vouch for the treatment
received from them, and hope they
will receive a liberal patronage of our
people.
Improvement on the Line.
T. A. Marsino, the owner of the
Jackson- Volcano stage line, has added
a new stage to the run, having brought
it up from Stockton on Tuesday. The
rig was made to order, and is a model
of neatness and durability, and will add
much to the pleasure and convenience
of the patrons of the route.
Visiting Canada.
Thomas Carley, who has a position
at the sulpherets works at the Ken
nedy mine, returned Wednesday even
ing from a two month's trip to his old
homo In Canada. He visited all of the
principal cities of Canada as well as
those on this side of the line, and while
the trip was a pleasant one, Tom was
more than glad to get back to Cali
fornia once more.

Mrs. Chas. Ginocchio, his sister, who
brought him home. Since then his
health has gradually failed, until death
relieved him of all further suffering.
He leaves to mourn his death, a widow
and two little girls, a father', mother,
three brothers and two sisters, all of
whom have the heartfelt sympathy of
the entire community.

A Fish Story.
Frank Burgin, Frank Johnson, Chez
Ardltto, Billy Hess and Ed Kelloy,
piloted by ;l Billy" Blue, left last Friday,
on a fishing trip to the mountains.
They returned on Monday, and if all
reports are true, enough fish were
caught to supply all of Jackson. No
one doubts the boys' words, but where
are the fish?
Fire at Fine Grove.
The house of Will Hipkins at Pine
Grove was burned to the ground about
midnight on Tuesday night. The
house and contents were a total loss,
and it was with difficulty that the
family escaped without injury. The
house was insured for $400 and the
furniture for $100 in a company repre
sented by L. J. Fontenrose.
Expansion.
Dr. A. M. Gall has enlarged his of
fice in the Marelia building by adding
another room, which will be used for
operating purposes and such treatment
necessary in a well arranged doctor's
office. The improvement is a move in
the right direction, and the doctor is
now provided with quarters second to
none.
Natural feed is remarkably short in
this section considering the unusually
favorable season we have had. Rain
fell at just the right time, and it was
thought that grass would be very
plentiful. It is not so, however, and
the reason is not easy of explanation.
Grain is also short, although healthy
and vigorous in appearance. Timely
showers will bring it out all right, and
I ensure a good crop.
THE BIG STRIKE OVER
Both Sides Satisfied— Mines Getting
Into Banning Order Again.
The big strike came to an end Fri
day night. At that time a special
meeting of Jackson Union was held. It
was evident throughout the day that
important business was on hand. M.
W. Moor, of the Western Federation,
had visited Paloma during the day,
and the superintendents of all tho
mines bad also bad a meeting during
the day. From these things, it was
surmised that the special meeting was
called to consider some proposition
toward ending the struggle. As soon
as the members gathered in their hall,
David McCluro, superintendent of the;
Gwin mine, was invited to make a state
ment in behalf of the mine owners, em
bodying what they were disposed to
grant. He diseu^i'U ■at some length
tho points in dispute, and thereafter
presented the following propositions in
writing as the final stand of the mine
owners:
(1) No discrimination against union
men as such.
(2) Substitution of nine hours for
what is now ten hours underground
with same rate of wages.
Explanatory:— Said shift to begin
when first.. men start down from collar
of shaft, and to end when first men
start up shaft from station after quit
ting work, with time taken for lunch
added. In other words, time required
to get to work and time to get to sta
tion after work to be on companies'
time, and time required to get out of
shaft at end of shift and to eat lunch
on men's time.
(3) That reinstatement be left to the
discretion of the mine management.
(4) Union not to bo recognized.
Mr. McClure, after making his state
ment, withdrew, and the union deliber
ated over the matter. The discussion,
however, was brief, and in a short time
he was informed by M. yV. Moor
that his proposition had been accepted,
and the strike had been called off. It
was getting along toward . midnight
when the result was.' known., / The
union. men showed their gratification
Qypr the.', end pt J,b.e .pgntrßyersy by
rounds of pheers, and everybody scorned
happy that the termination came as
soon as it did,- without that serious
disturbance of business "; conditions
which a prolongation of the conflict
was bound to bring about. V . "
. The terms of settlement regarding
the working hours are so plainly stated
that it is hardly possible that they cau
be I misunderstood. - The , new system
means a substitution of nine' working
hours in the place of \en. Jn other
wgrds a cgncejjsion by the sunerjntend
entß of one full hour in working time.
The miners, however, while they fully
understand the language, claim that it
means 1J hours less per day to them.
So that under these circumstances, the
reformed time table gives the utmost
satisfaction to the men, and at the
same time concedes a reduction qf the
working hours underground which had
long before tbe strike been under seri
ous consideration of the mine managers.
It is confidently expected that the
minus will lose nothing by the change.
That the same amount of work will be
done in nine hours that has heretofore
been done in ten with the same num
ber pf njon. fndeed th.o men them
selves are not backward in saying that
they will show by actual results that
tbe nine hour day will be a saving all
round.
Sunday afternoon the union miners
had a grand parade in commemoration
of the settlement. It was distinctly
understood that it was not designed as
a glorification on their part over the
outcome. It was not In the spirit of
oxultatipn, but simply an orderly turn
out to express the general feeling of re
lief over the ending of the trouble.
The procession started from the hall
on Cpurt street, headed by the Jackson
band. By actual count' the parade
numbered a little over 300. In front of
the Central hotel a halt was called,
and addresses made from the balcony.
W. D. Oulds as president of the Jack
son organization introduced the speak
ers. Brief addresses were made by Dr.
Lonigo, R. C. Bole and It. Tadich, the
latter addressing them In English,
Italian and Austrian.
Monday morning the Zeila mine re
sumed work. Several days must elapse
before a, full force is put on. The Ken
nedy will take several days to drain
the mine and get in fix to employ a full
complement of men. The new mill
was started Monday on ore from the
dump. There Is plenty of this on hand
to keep the mill going for some time.
As might be anticipated some dis
sension at once arose in setting the new
time schedule into operation. At the
Kennedy and Oneida, the time allowed
for dinner did not suit some. These
mines pursued the same course in this
respect that was in vogue before the
strike- namely one hour for dinner.
The miners, or some of them, wanted
half an hour, and to eat underground.
This would reduce the work-day half
an hour. Another bone of contention
arose in relation to a few men who were
not taken back to work. Although
this point is covered by the terms of
settlement, leaving the question of
reinstatement In the hands of the
superintendent, tho men wore under
the impression that all who went out
on strike would be restored to employ
ment; that tho reinstatement related
only to those who were discharged
before the strike. Notices were posted
up Monday calling a special meeting
of Jackson Union for Tuesday evening.
That meeting passed, however, with
out any action in regard to these ques
tions. As soon as the Kennedy man
agement became aware of the kick
about lunch 'hour, the half hour ar
rangement was promptly conceded.
There Is no doubt that all the man
agers took the course deemed best to
faithfully carry out the terms of the
agreement, and to satisfy their em
ployes.

Henry Bradley, the shakemaker,
bought a horse some five months ago
from a person in the mountains. The
animal proved a fair saddle horse, and
Bradley was congratulating himself on
his bargain, whon the matter assumed
a phase that he little anticipated.
Monday he rode to lone on the horse,
and was told on the way that he was
riding a stolen horse; that it belonged
to the Bonnefoys. He came on to
Jackson, and sure enough the horse
was identified as one that had been
missed from the Bonnefoy pasture sev
eral months ago. Bradley was perfect
ly innocent in the matter, and was the
victim of a poor bargain. There was
nothing to do but to surrender the
animal to its owner, and seek redress
from the party from whom It was pur
chased. He turned over the horse
Tuesday morning. He had made ar
rangements to go to his mountain place
that day, but this turn of affairs left
him without any way of traversing the
thirty miles except on foot. Bradley
says this Is just about the sort of luck
that has attended him In his trading
enterprises..

SUICIDE OF ARTHUR M. SCOTT
No Canse for the Act Other than De
spondency.
Coroner Huberty held an inquest in
lone on Friday last over the body of
Arthur M. Scott, who was found dead
in the park near the race track on
Thursday evening. The bo<iy was
discovered by Michael Scully, who lives
at the track, about 6 o'clock Thursday
evening, who immediately reported the
matter to the authorities. It appears
from the facts developed at the investi
gation that the deceased repaired to
the park a short-time before the
tragedy. The report of a pistol was
heard by W. Sutherland between 5 and
6in the evening. A hammerless re
volver of 38 calibre, with one empty
chamber, lay by his side, and a bullet
wound in the head, told the story of
the end. Two unsealed letters were
found on the body, both dated April
22, the day before the shooting. One
was addressed to Miss Grace Westfall,
and the other to Mrs. R. R. Scott,
mother of deceased.. Each letter, was
written on a half sheet "of note paper,
with lead ponoll. These documents
throw no light on the cause of self de
struction, other than to show that the
act was pre-medltated, and that a
brooding melancholy disposition was
the moving cause. . In both letters he
stated that he had had no trouble with
any one. He requested that the letters
be not published, and that the one to
"Grace," having a two-cent stamp at
tached, be sealed and deposited in the
postoffice. The jury returned a verdict
in accordance with the above facts.
Deceased was born at Kennedy Flat,
October 12, 1875. Most of his child
hood days were passed at lone, 'At
the age of six he was severely in
jured by a wagon wheel passing over
his head, and was subject to attacks of
headache from that time. For the
last three years these attacks became
more frequent and severe. He worked
much of his time for the railroad com
pany, land was a sober, steady and in
dustrious young man. Besides father
and mother, he leaves four brothers
and two sisters to mourn his sad ' and
untimely end. ■• ■■ "5 V-^ *=■
| The . funeral took place Saturday
under the auspices of the Foresters; of

MINING NOTES.
Emmons. — The Cranmer brothers
have cleaned out the old shaft on this
property at Pine Grove and taken out
ten tons of ore from a drift near the
surface. This rock they expect to
crush within the next few days.
Kennedy.— The water was all out of
the west shaft Wednesday morning.
Tools wore replaced in the mine and
some men put to work to fix things for
the resumption of mining. At the east
shaft the water is nearly drained. In
a few days this great property will be
in full working order. All the mines
are a little short handed at present,- as
during the strike it " is v estimated that
nearly 200 men left the camp. Men
are coming here, however, and the
shortness of help In any capacity is not
likely to be of long duration.
Fkemont Consolidated.— At this
mlno signs of a prosperous future are
In evidence. The grading for the new
forty stomp mill ; has been completed,
and on next Monday work will be com
menced on the concrete foundation.
The lumber and other materials are on
the ground, and it is expected to. have
the mill. finished and ready for work
early in the fall.
Zeila,— Both mine and mill are In
operation, and both will : have a full
working forcein a few days. The em
ployes are more than satisfied with the
working shifts. One shift goes to work
at 5 p. m. and gets out at 2:00 a.- m.;
the other shift commences at 7 a. m.
and gets out at 4:30. This arrange
ment works to the satisfaction; iufact
the miners are not ' backward in'ex
i pressing their gratification at the man
agement thereof.

HOW DOGS FIND THEIR WAY
evidence Tbat They l'oaaena Pecul-
iar Power to Guide TUcni.
lii the old days of tbe James river
canal a fine setter was taken by his
master on a packet boat which was so
crowded that the dog was put la tho
captain's cabin to be out of the way,
says the New York Mall and Express.
Ills owner reached his destination aft
er nightfall and had taken bo much
wine by that time that he waa carried
off the boat, and no one remembered
liis setter.
Next morning the captain took the
dog on deck with him, but was much
afraid he would Jump off to the tow
path and try to return that w nyi and so
handsome an animal would have been
in danger of being stolen.
Carlo, however, lay perfectly quiet,
but with an air of listening that at
tracted notice. Toward noon he heard
the sound of the born of a packet com
ing from the opposite way, and as the
boats passed each other he made a leap
and was next heard from as having
got off at the place where his master
had stopped and as having gone at
once to the house where he was a
guest.
Could human Intelligence have sur
passed that?
This same dog lay on his master's
grave and refused food until be 'died
from starvation. But I do not give this
as a case in point.
A gentleman who lived a hundred
miles from a city moved there with all
his possessions, including a bulldog
which bad been raised at his father's
home, where he had hitherto resided.
He was locked up In the CBr with the
furniture and in the bustle of unloading
disappeared, and two days afterward
he reached his former home, coming by
an inland route, as was known by par
ties who recognized him, so that he evi
dently marked out his own path with
out reference to the railroad on which
he had been carried away.
THE OMNIBUS.
It Vu Introduced by BlsJse Pascal,
tbe Noted Mathematician.
No less a personage than the famous
mathematician, Blaise Pascal, Is said
to have Introduced the vehicle which
we call the "omnibus." Unlike most
other men of learning, Pascal was more
or less Interested In the affairs of prac
tical life. He was the Inventor of the
pushcart that now perambulates our
streets, says the Scientific American. .
In 1001 he had largo wagons built
for regular traffic In the heart of Paris.
He allied himself In- this undertaking
with several influential friends, ameng
whom was the Duke of Roannes.
In 1002 Louis XIV. granted letters
patent to Pascal, In which It was said
that these carriages were Intended for
the comfort of poor people who had to
go to courts of Justice or who were
sick and so poor that they could not af
ford to pay the two plstoea exacted by
the chairmen anfi the drivers of
coaches.
At first the use of the vehicle was
not generally permitted. A royal de
cree forbade Its use by soldiers, pages,
lackeys aud other liveried servants, as
well as artisans and porters.
Pascal, In spite of the fact that he
only lived to be thirty-nine, is said to
have made no inconsiderable sum out
of his Invention. :
After the vehicle had been in use
some sixteen years it was abandoned
for various reasons! It was not until
1812 that It was again Introduced, this
time in Bordeaux, which city was fol
lowed In 1821 by Nantes and in 1827
by Paris. The vehicle was Improved
and rapidly became popular. Now it
has been almost displaced by the tram
way.
In modern times the vehicle was
called an omnibus simply for the rea
son that it was intended for the car
riage of all, without any restrictions as
to lackeys, pages or footmen.
His Mistake.
"Once at a party," sold a Scotch cler
gyman, "there was a crusty old Scot
seated at a whist table playing pas
sionately, and his partner was a young
woman, the daughter of a neighboring
laird. You are to" Imagine this young
woman's surprise In the heart of the
game when the old fellow threw down
his cards and bawled at her:
" 'What kind of a game are ye play-
In", ye darned auld'—
"And then, recollecting himself, he
bowed and said humbly to the aston
ished girl:
"'Yer pardon's begged, madam. I
took ye In the excitement for my aln
wlfo. 1 "
Marriage an* Crime.
It is said that statistics prove that in
every 1,000 bachelors there are thirty
eight criminals, while in every 1,000
married men the criminals number only
eighteen. If this is go, it surely proves
that the present day members of the
Bex labeled coy and hard to please have
at least an immense capability for
keeping men out of mischief, sufficient
to outbalance perhaps even the unkind
reputation handed down the ages by
Mother Eve.— London Tatler.

STANTON'S IRISH STEW.
A Story of the Great War Secretary
a.;. Told by His Bodyguard.
An attempt by Secretary of War
Stanton to cook an Irish stew while
holding the war department office
against the removal order of President
"Andrew Johnson is one of many anec
dotes related by Louis Koerth, at the
period mentioned the great war secre
tary's bodyguard.
Feb. 21, 1808, President Johnson ap
poiuted General Lorenzo Thomas sec
retary of war ad Interim, but the pow
er of removal having been taken by
the tenure of office act from the presi
dent, Mr. Stauton refused to resign or
to vacate the office of secretary.
He camped in the office, determined
to hold it until the result of the Im
peachment proceedings against the
president, which were then pending in
the senate, should be determined. For
sixty days Mr. Stanton heid "the fort."
and during that period his faithful
bodyguard, ex-Sergeant Louis Koerth,
then In the United Btates general serv
ice, assigned to the war department,
kept him company.
On the day In which Mr. Stanton re
ceived the official notification of his
removal by the president he made Im
mediate preparations for a siege. He
dispatched. Sergeant Koerth to Mrs.
Stanton for blankets and pillows, but
that lady refused to send them, Insist
ing that the secretary should come
home aud give up the office.
Mr. Stanton smiled on receiving her
message and simply said:
"Koertb, go to your own house and
bring blankets, pillows and such cook-
Ing utensils as we may need."
The Irish stew was the first effort
of the secretary and his bodyguard.'
Koerth, being a German, needed in
structions in the mysteries of prepar
ing the savory stew, and the secretary
named the various ingredients, which
he ordered the servant to purchase. ;
Both men had spent a busy and la
boriously exciting day, and both were
tired out when the pot was put on the
fire to cook the stew.
The consequence was that the great
war secretary and his bodyguard fell
asleep. The secretary was tbe first to
be awakened by the smell of the burn-
Ing stew.
"Koertb, Koerth I Wake up, man!"
shouted Mr. Stanton. "Tbe stew Is
burnlngP'
Koerth sprang to his feet, but, alas,
too late to save Mr. Stanton's Irish
stew. It was burned and smoking,
while the pot was a glowing red. Rue
fully the secretary rolled himself up In
his blankets on the sofa and went to
sleep for the night supperiess.—Wash
ington Post.
POULTRY POINTERS.
A healthy fowl will drink fifteen or
twenty times a day.
Sharp gravel should always be sup
plied to fowls that are fattened In close
confinement.
Box nests are all right If made large
enough, the size depending upon the
breed of fowls.
Linseed meal is excellent as an egg
producing meal, but it should be fed in
connection with coarse or bulky foods.
Soft eggs laid before the shell has
formed are caused by overfeeding. Give
less food and more pounded shells oi
Ilmewater.
A varied diet for poultry is a neces
sary help to their general health and
has much to do with their value aa
breeders. ■.>;-'
If disease appears and resists reme
dies, It Is better to begin with new
stock than to breed from those that
have been sick a long time.
A light, sandy soil is always best for
a poultry yard. A heavy clay soil is al
ways damp and, unless care is taken,
will cause roup, while a sandy soil, be
ing dry, will promote warmth.
Appreciated Himself.
A little boy while playing near the
Serpentine fell into the water. An
Irish laborer who was passing at the
time courageously jumped Into tbe wa
ter, clothes and all, and rescued the
boy, says Spare Moments.
A lady who had observed the bravo
deed went up to Pat and, shaking his
hand, said:
"I feel It on honor, my brave man,
to shake hands with you. Many a
worse man than you had been present
ed at court."
"Faith, you're roight, mum/ replied
Pat as he proceeded to wring the wa
ter out of his coat "Tb* last tolme dl
waa preslnted at court Oi only got one
month, wholle me mate got two, begor
ral"
Saved I>y the Soloist.
An old lady who at the best was cer
tainly not very musical attended
church one morning a little while ago.
During the service an anthem was
sung by the choir, during which a cer
tain Mr. Wood rendered a solo. When
returning home, the old lady remarked
to a friend:
"Dear, dear! What a mesa they made
of that anthem, to be sure. Why, if it
bad not been for Mr. Wood they would
have broken down . entirely in one
part"— London Standard.
Matched.
Towne— Met Gabble and Perkins at
n smoker last night and introduced
them to each other.
Browne— Oh, say, It's a shame to In
troduce a bore Uke Gabble to anybody.
Towne— lt's evident you don't know
Perkins or you'd see the humor of It
Criticising His Own.
"But, my dear husband, It really Is
Unjust of you to abuse mothers-in-law
«o. There are good ones."
"Well, well; never mind I haven't
paid anything against yours. It's only
tnfne I'm grumbling about.'.' — Boston
