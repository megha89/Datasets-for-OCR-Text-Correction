SASH WINDOWS.
fr*w>ba: i Dutch Invention of the
««. venteenth Century.
The history of sash wiodows is some
what obscure, but : probability is
that they were a Dutch invention and
that they were introduced into. Eng
land soon after the revolution of 168&
The derivation of the word "sash" In
♦ills sense is the Dutch "sas," a sluice
old Euglish "sasse." In Queen Anne's
reign they were yet so comparatively
uncommon as to be mentioned as a
special feature of houses that were
advertised as "To let" In the Tatler,
for instance, No. 178, May 27-30, 1710,
there is this advertisement:
"To be lett, in Devonshire Square,
near Bishopsgate, a very good Brick
House of 3 Rooms of a Floor, and a
good Hall, with very good light and
dark Closets, the whole House being
well wainscoted, and snsh'd with 30
Bash Lights, a very pleasant aud con
venient Office below Stairs," etc. /
Prom England they passed into
Prance, where the first to put them up
was Marshal de Lorge at his new
house at 1 Montmartre. Speaking of
this. Lister in 1C99 writes in his "Jour
ney to Paris:" "We had the good for
tune here to find the marshal himself.
He showed us his great sash windows,
how easily they might be lifted up and
down aud stood at any height which
coutrivance. he said, he had out of
England by a small model brought on
purpose from thence, there '.icing noth
ing of this poise In windows in France
before."— lx>ndon Standard.
Fresh Clothing.
Go to bed in fresh clothing every
night Never think of allowing your
self to sleep in the cloth Ins worn dur
ing the day— not a stitch of it Take
everything off. Put on nisht clothing
that has been thoroughly aired.
When you get up in the morning,
take off everything again. This Is the
time to take a cold bath, very quickly,
with vigorous rubbing. If for any rea
son you dp not take the cold bath, rub
your skin" all over thoroughly with a
rough toweL Don't be afraid of being
naked a little while.
There Is no better tonic for the skin
than nakedness. Take off everything.
Give yourself a little hand massage.
Exercise the muscles. Rub your skin
with a coarse towel, anything, so as
to spend a little time naked. Then
put on fresh clothing. ■
People who wear the same clothes
every night and day get 'themselves
surrounded by an atmosphere of their
own bodily emanations tliat Is very
unhealthy. Neither faith cures nor
drug cures are of a particle of use to
dirty people. Cleanliness.- is the first
law. of health. If this law be broken,
it will be very little use to try any
remedy.— Exchange.
How Water Freezes.
It used to puzzle all thinking people
why ponds and rivers do not freeze be
yond a certain depth.- This depends on
a most curious fact— namely, that wa
ter is at its heaviest when it reaches
10 degrees P.— that Is, 8 degrees above
freezing point On a frosty night as
each top layer of water falls to 40 de
grees it sinks to the bottom; therefore
the whole pond has to drop to 40 de
grees, before any of it can freeze. At
last ft is all cooled to this point, and
then ice begins to form. But ice is a
very bad conductor of heat; therefore
it shuts off the freezing air from the
big body of comparatively warm wa
ter underneath. The thicker it gets
the more perfectly., does It act as a
great coat and that is why even the
Arctic ocean never freezes beyond a
few feet in thickness.— Marine Jour
nal.
Hani to Get.
A certain young fellow received a
government berth, for which he had
to undergo a very strict examination.'
One day a friend of his who had been
noticing how little work he did to earn
his salary tackled him.
"I say, Walter, my boy," he began,
"you don't perform a great deal of la
boi* do voiiV"
"No, I don't have to."
"Aren't you expected to work?"
"Of course not" was the candid re
ply. "It takes so much hard work to
get a job like this that the authorities
haven't the nerve to ask a man to do
anything more to earn his salary after
he gets it"
Am Enterprising Burglar.
A professional burglar in Bertlu
found a new and original way of add
ing tothe ordinary profits of his pro
fession. After each burglary he senr

PURE SUNLIGHT AND AIR.
flnces Here WliU-h Shame the Old
AVorld'it Fnvorv:' OimfM.
, We- have ofteu heard of "sunny Ita
ij" or the "clear light" of Egypt, says
the Desert; but, believe tne, there is no
vunlight- there compared with that
, which falls upon the upper peaks of
the Sierra Madre or the uninhabitable
wastes of the Colorado desert.
Pure sunlight requires for its ex
istence pure air, .and the old world has
little of it left. When you are hi
Rome again and stand upon that hill
where all good Romanists go at sun
set look out and see how dense is the
atmosphere between you and St. Pe
ter's dome. That sanie thick air is all
over Europe, all around the Mediter
ranean, even over in Mesopotamia and
by the banks' of the Gauges. It has
been breathed and burned and battle
smoked for 10,000 years.
Hide, up nnd over the high tablelands
of Montana— one can still . ride ; there
for days without seeing a trace of hu
manity—and how clear and scentless,
how absolutely intangible, that sky
blown, sunshot atmosphere! You
breathe it without feeling it, you see
through It a hundred miles, and the
picture is not blurred by It. Once
more ride over the enchanted mesas of
Arizona at sunrise or sunset, witli the
ragged mountains of Mexico to the
south of you and the broken spurs of
the great Sierra around about you, and
all the glory of the old shall be as
nothing to the gold and purple and
burning crimson of this new world.
Movable Dropa In Dlanionilx.
It has loug been known that dia
monds, especially the class known as
"rose diamonds," are likely to explode
if subjected only to what would seem a
very ordinary degree of heat such as
strong rays from the sun, etc. It is
now believed that the explosions are
the result of the rapid expansion of
certain volatile liquids inclosed in cavi
ties near the center of these precious
stones. A great many diamonds, even
though cut, mounted and worn as gems
of perfection, are still in an unfinished
condition— that is, the liquid drop from
which the stone is being formed has
not as yet deposited all of its "pure
crystals of carbon." These movable
drops may occasionally be seen with
the naked eye.
When this Is the case, a strong mi
croscope will give the drop the appear
ance of a bubble in the fluid of a car
penter's level. It is also highly prob
able that besides the liquid mentioned
these cavities may contain gases under
great tension. This being the case,
one may readily comprehend how a
very small amount of heat would
cause the liquid and gas to expand to
such a degree that the diamond would
give way with all the characteristics
of a miniature explosion.
Something He Had Forgotten.
"So you enjoyed your continental
trlp/dld you?" Inquired the simple old
gentleman. "I haven't been over In
fifty years, but my recollections are
still vivid. I remember once standing
on Mont Blanc, watching the sun sink
behind the blue waters of the Mediter
ranean, while to my right the noble
Rhine rushed onward to the Black sea, 1
and the Pyrenees, still holding the
snows of winter, were on the left. I
remember while standing there"—
"But Mr. Grey," feebly Interrupted
his listener, "I was on Mont Blanc
myself, and really — you'll excuse me —
but -you really must be mistaken in
your geography."
"Mistaken?" returned the old man
lightly. "Not a bit of it. But I for
got; it's different now. You know, my
dear boy, that since my day the entire
map of Europe has been changed by
these awful wars, and so of course you
can't appreciate what it was fifty years
ago."
Ancestry of Shoemaklng.
There is nothing vulgar about the
ancestry of the. shoeniaking trade In
the United States. The first shoemak
er came over In the Mayflower. His
name was Thomas Beard, and he had
an income from the London company
of $100 a year and received fifty acres
of land on which to settle. Seven
years later the city of Lynn was
founded, and ever since it has been
making shoes for the world. Philip
Kertland, a native of Buckingham
shire, was the first ' shoemaker of the
city of Lynn. In George Washington's
day Lynn had 200 master workmen
and 600 journeymen shoemakers, turn-
Ing out every year no less than 300,000
pairs of fine shoes.
KavlKutiiie the Elbe.
A curious means of moving boats Is
employed on the river Elbe— a chain
890 miles long at the bottom . of the
stream, which is too swift to navigate
In the usual way. The boats are ISO
feet long and provided with 200 horse
power steam engines which turn a
drum fastened on the deck. The chain
comes In over the bow, passing along
on rollers to the drum, around which
It is wound three times. The chain Is
then carried to the stern, where it
drops back into the water. The steam
ers tow five barges containing 1,500
tons.
Logical.
"J could have married either Whip

both of those men whom I refused
have since got rich, while you are still
as poor as a church mouse."

you all these years. They haven't

BHE HAD HER WAY.
Vhe Story of m Tmuii Racket and a
Sarcaattc Maiden.
She was a demure looking girl, young
and Blight, and her hair clung to her
forehead in babyish little rings. . In
her hand fiho held a tennis racket.
Three of 'the strings were J'sprung.".
She explained to the salesman In the
big sporting goods house that the rack
et was an expensive ope; tnat It had
broken at the first trial; that the fact
of its having done so Bad caused h«r
much annoyance, as she had bought It
for a birthday present r In conclusion
she was here to return it
The salesman noted the ' babyish
curls, and, adopting the manner of a
bored but rather good natured cat to
an irresponsible kitten, he promised to
have the racket restrung. jj
"But I don't want It restrung," said
the girl. "I want a new one."
"Olvbut I can't give you a new one,"
said the clerk reprovingly. "This one
has been used."
"Yes," said the girl meekly; "it has
been used, and. therein was my mis
take. You see, I fancied I had bought
a tennis racket and so described it to
the recipient He foolishly, believed
me and used It Had we both known
that your firm was charging $7 for pa
pier mache souvenirs fashioned after
the form of a racket, why, he Would
have put it upon his wall as a decora
tion. Yes," she continued politely; "I
admit we erred in using it." Ana she
smiled prettily. ■ .
- Then she gave her address and
walked out' The next day the firm
sent a new racket— New York Times.
The Rainbow.
When a ray of sunlight falls on a
raindrop. It is refracted; 'then part of
the light Is reflected from the internal
surface and again refracted on leaving
the drop. The white sunlight is not
only refracted when It enters and
leaves the drop, but dispersion also
takes place. The eye sees bright cir
cles of light for each kind of light, and
since sunlight is made up of different
kinds cf homogeneous light we get a
series of circular arcs, showing the
spectrum colors, the red being outside
and the other colors following In the
order of descending wave length. The
whole constitutes a primary rainbow.
A secondary bow is sometimes seen
outside the 'first. This is formed by
the light being twice reflected Inside
the raindrops. The less refrangible
rays are on the inner side. Rainbows
due to still more internal reflections
are too feeble to be observed. It Is
possible to get a white rainbow If the
sun is clouded or If there is a mixture
of raindrops of very different sizes. I
liiKhtning Precaution..
An electrical engineer declares that
the center of the room is the safest
place from lightning.
"There is a constant tendency on the
part of the electricity in the sky to
reach the ground," he says. "To do this
it must have a conductor. Atmos
pheric electricity always follows the
outside of the conductor or agency
that leads it to the ground. That's
why the middle of the room is safest
during an electrical storm.
"I know of a number of Instances
where a bolt of lightning followed
the walls of a room, burning it on all
four sides, while the people In It being
away from the walls, were only slight
ly shocked. That Is the only safe pre
caution known to science." :
A State Dinner In Venice.
In 1552 the patriarch of Aquilela
feted RanucclO' Farnese, the pope's
nephew, in the palace on the Gludec
ca. The rooms were decked with ex
traordinary sumptuousness, doth of
gold, paintings and Illuminations add
ing to the effect produced by the patri
arch's cooks. Among the guests were
twelve gentlemen In fancy marine cos
tumes of green satin with red lining,
wearing caps of the same colors and
each accompanied by a lady dressed In
white. This repast lasted four hours,
varied by music and the professional
entertainers of the day. It ended with
the cutting up of certain large pies
from which live birds flew out Into the
room. The guests strove with each
other to catch these birds.
Discourteous Courtier.
Once upon a time the prime minister
went to the king and complained that
a certain courtier, who was very hard
of hearing, had been making very un
complimentary remarks about his sov
ereign. >
"Your majesty should apeak to him
about It," said the minister, "that it
may cease, but you must needs speak
loud."
."I will speak so loud," answered the
king, "that I guarantee the offense will
never be repeated." .
He then sent the offending courtier
to the guillotine.

THE BUYER OF BEEP.
He la • Man /Of Oona«a*aao« About
the Stockrarda.
The buyer occupies a position of con
■equence In the stockyards community.
Ho Is an expert, usually a man of mid
dle age, who has obtained bis educa
tion and technical ability partly in the
packing houses and partly on the ranch.
An experienced buyer Is likely to re
ceive, a salary of fi,ooo to |5/ *0 a

his ability to tell by a moment's in
spection what quality of beef will be
produced by a steer that be never be
fore laid eyes on depends primarily the
excellence of the product Issued by his
house and hence the Increase of Its
business.
The buyer's work is not arduous, and
to all appearance his task 1b a simple
one. He walks along -the flat board
laid along the top of the fence, glanc
ing keenly at the cattle in the. different
pens. Some he passes by without a
pause, others he stops to Inspect more
closely, and occasionally he displays
his Interest in a group by asking a
question or two of the man in charge.
Long experience enables him at a
glance to distinguish between a grass
fed steer and a corn fed steer, to de-.
cide whether an animal is entitled to
be classed as "fancy," "good" or "com
mon" and to guess within a few pounds
of an animal's exact weight by glanc
ing at him. The. buyer makes his pur
chases "on the hoof," paying the mar
ket price ruling for the day for the
grade in which it Is decided each group
of cattle' belongs. In a few words the
transaction Is completed, and the buy

An Anecdote of Bach.
The Duke of Soxe-TVelmar once invit
ed John Sebastian Bach, the Nestor of
German music, to attend a dinner at
the palace. Before the guests sat down
to the feast Bach was asked to give
an Improvisation. The composer seat
ed himself at the harpsichord and
straightway forgot all about dinner
and everything else. He played so long
that at last the duke touched his shoul
der and said,- "We are very much
obliged, master, but we must not let
the soup get cold."
Bach sprang to his feet and followed
the duke to the dining room without
ottering a word. But he was scarcely
seated when be sprang up, rushed back
to the instrument like one demented,
struck a few Chords and returned to
the dining room, evidently feeling much
better. ■ "I beg pardon, your highness,"
he said, "but you interrupted me in a
series of chords and arpeggios on the
dominant seventh, and I could not feel
at ease until they were resolved Into
the tonic. It is as if you had snatched
a glass of water from the lips of a man
dying of thirst. Now I have drunk the
glass out and ani content."
Falcon* In Japan.
In the olden times in Japan. all the
daimlos (similar to the old English
lord) had great sport with falcons, aa
they went out to the field to catch other
birds with falcons. The falcons were
tamed well and used to catch large
birds, mostly cranes." When people now
go out hunting with falcons, the men
In charge hold them upon their fin
gers. As soon as one sees any bird
he lets the falcon rush at the bird; as
soon as the falcon reaches the bird he
bites at the throat and throws the bird
down to the ground. Meanwhile the
holder runs to the place where they are
and catches both of them.
Falcons are not large birds; but, as
they belong to the eagle family, they
are strong and brave and never afraid
to go at any bird to kill it, but the men
In charge of falcons of course take
great care In feeding and taming them.

snowball* Brought Water. .
"Speaking of drinking water," said
one of a group of men waiting for
a shower to pass over, "the best I ever
drank was on my uncle's farm.
"We lived on top of a clay hill and
had a well very deep, sixty feet ' I
reckon, but it never had any water in
it until ten years ago. - A heavy snow
fell that winter, and uncle filled the
well with snow. He rolled up balls
until they were large enough to go into
the well cleverly and then dumped
them in until it was packed to the
top. They were packed so closely that
they did not melt until late the fol
lowing summer, . but when they did
they produced a supply of water I
never saw surpassed for purity, soft
ness or coolness. ' It was delicious. -
"Strange to say, this well, always
dry before, has produced a plentiful
supply since. The water, while not as
good |as that from the snowballs, is
still excellent and celebrated through

Gall, Not Heart, In China.
The Chinese, says the Shanghai Mer
cury, lay stress on the amount of gall
a man has and not on the amount of
heart Thus we read of Hou King;
who was governor of Honan in the
sixth century, that he once captured a
rebel named Li Cheh, brought him into
the market, chopped off his hands and
his feet, ripped up his heart and cut
out his vitals. The victim, however,
continued to Jest with his features un
distorted and his countenance un
changed. His gall bladder was then
seen , to have the capacity of a pint
measure, which completely accounted
for his stocisin. In 1045, when the ar
mies of the Mantchoos were gradually
overrunning China, one Wu Han Chao
made head against them in Annul, b v t
he finally fell into their hands. The
historian records that his gall was
three inches long. -
After the Strike.
He tried the door with his key, but
the thing was locked on the inside —
locked and bolted.' And just as he
was about to apply the knocker a
voice, stern and admonitory, reached
him from above:
"Hello! Who are you? What do
you want?"
"My dear," he called, "isn't that a
trifle gratuitous? 1 want to come in.
D'ye see?"
"Where have you been till this
•hour?"
"Club, my darling. Been down dis
cussing the strike."

back and. discuss the lockout Does It

FRIDAY : NOVEMBER 21, 1902
THE COUNTING OUT PROCESS.
In Tuolumne county at the late
election the hottest fight gathered,
as in Amador county, around the
contest for sheriff. The outcome at
the polls was that 'A flams, the re
publican nominee, d u-ated Sweeney,
the democratic incumbent and candi
date for reelection, by a slim margin
of two votes. On this slender show
ing the political schemers resolved
themselves into a committee of ways
and means to defeat the choice of
the people as expressed at the bal
lot-box. At the canvass of the re
turns by the democratic board of
supervisors, it was found that the
election officers of one small pre
cinct, Springfield, had failed to send
in a tally list with the returns, and
objection was made in behalf of
Sweeney to the counting of the vote
of the precinct on this ground. The
officers of election were summoned,
and the missing tally sheet was re
covered. Still the" cry to throw out
the vote would not down. The tally
list did not accompany the sealed
package containing the returns. The
district attorney gave his opinion in
favor of counting the vote, but in
face of all this the democratic
majority voted to reject the returns
in toto, and thereby declared Sween
ey elected by a majority of one vote.
That is a nice sample of justice, to
gain a partisan end. It is the most
barefaced fraud perpetrated by an
official body that has come under
onr notice for a long time. It is
safe to say that it will fail of its pur
pose. Of course, Adams will contest
the matter in the courts. How in
dignant the sovereign voters of
Springfield must feel at the thought
that they can be disfranchised be
cause of the simple error of an elec
tion officer in neglecting^to inclose
a tally sheet with the returns. If
this action is to be sustained, people
will begin to think that the right of
suffrage in free America rests on au
extremely insecure basis. We ven
ture to say that the democracy of
Tuolumne county will be the princi
pal sufferer by this insane move.
Citizens, as a rule, regardless of
partisanship, love fairness and right
dealing above all things, and they
will not tolerate a reversal of the
choice of the voters on such a barren
technicality as the absence of a por
tion of the election returns in the
sealed package. Such high-handed
proceedings will come to nought.
Later reports show that this
scheme was speedily frustrated.
The superior court on mandamus
proceedings ordered the supervisors
to count the vote of the precinct,
thereby giving the election to the
republican candidate, and placing
Sweeney in the position of con
testant.
INTEMPERATE ADVICE.
In our democratic cotemporary
last week there appeared an article
signed Frank O'Connell, President
Jackson Miners' Union No. 115.
It berates the workingmen because
they do not flock in a body to join
the infant organization, which prom
ises to introduce the millenium for
the workingmen of Amador county.
It is not the province of the Ledger
to urge men to join, or refrain from
joining in this movement. The toil
ers of Amador county are as a rule
intelligent men, and ought to be
able to judge, each one for hiaiself,
as to what course he should pursue,
without advice from any one, and
especially without the assistance of
agitators from the outside. We do
deem it a duty we owe to the com
munity to protest against the in
cendiary utterances of the article in
question, which have no other object
in view but to make the working
men dissatisfied with their lot, and
the conditions under which they
have lived happily and contentedly
for so many years. The writer
intimates that the present system of
employment is "legalized robbery."
That is a very indefinite expression,
notwithstanding that it is emphatic
and intended to catch the ears of
the unwary. Of course, the writer
does not attempt to explain what he
means by such inflammatory lan
guage. The proposition is simply to
kindle the fires of dissatisfaction; to
array the wage-earners against the
wage-payers. This seems to be the
primary object in view: and with the
display of such a spirit we believe
the bulk of law-abiding, peace-loving
citizens will conclude that it is best
to leave such apostles of mischief
severely alone. The only clear-cut
idea that we can find in the com
munication is that miners are to
join hands with those who are "bat
tling for the abolition of the wage
system, and the emancipation of
the wage taker from the grasp of
corporate oppression." So this agi
tator aims not to raise the price of
labor, but to wipe out the wage sys
tem entirely. He would pull down
the whole fabric of wage earning.
That means the abolition of all dis
tinction between employers and em
ployes. The end in view, therefore,
is not reformation, but revolution.
The era of the workman being worthy
of and receiving the just value of his
hire is to be replaced by the era of
socialism and all things in common.
Such is the laboring man's paradise
toward which these visionaries are
trying to steer the "magnificent
vessel 1 ' they have recently launched.
No wonder the dreamers meet with
scant encouragement in a sensible
community like the people of Ama
dor county. It would be just as
well to take a small tumble, and get
down to earthy and practical things.
FREE-TRADE A POOR REMEDY.
The president is sincere in his cru
sade against the - trusts — there can
be no doubt of that. . But the presi
dent is statesman enough to know
that the tariff neither gave birth to
these enormous aggregations nor
largely fostered them after they
came into existence. The shallow
theory of those who would assail the
trusts by removing the protective
tariff from the goods which they
handle is that foreign goods would
then come into the country and drive
down the prices. It is true enough
that foreign goods would come into
the country if the tariffs were re
moved. Foreign goods are already
coming into the country in spite of
high tariffs. But foreign goods are
trust-made as well as our own, and
if they once command our markets,
driving our own factories out of ex
istence, the prices will rise higher
than they ever were before. This is
not guesswork, but the lesson of ex
perience. While we are shouting
against the oppressions of American
trusts", let us not forget that when
the manufacturers of Great Britain
commanded the American markets
the prices were much higher than
they are now.
If the anti-trust crusaders wish to
punish the trusts they might be able
to do something in that line by re
moving the protective tariffs." But
in punishing the trusts what will
happen generally to our country?
In the first place, the tariff protected
trusts do not monopolize a single in
dustry in the United States. We
hear much of the steel and iron
trust, and it is the biggest one on
the American continent. But the
fact remains that about one-half of
the total output of manufactured
iron and steel is the product of small
and independent factories. Of the
total production of iron ore in 1901
the steel trust produced only 43 per
cent. Of the Bessemer the trust's
share was 58 per cent: Of the steel
rails the trust's share was 59 per
cent. Of all rolled products the
trust's share was 50 per cent. For
the year 1902 the production of the
independent concerns will show a
larger per cent. It is proof that
the small concerns are growing and
that the trust cannot monopolize the
situation. But whatever of situa
tion there could be remaining after
our markets had been opened to
foreign goods would most certainly
be commanded by the trust, for it
can live longer in the face of such a
competition. .
In punishing the trusts we would
destroy the smaller industries. Fur
thermore, we would take from
American workmen an amount equal
to the labor performed in the pro
duction of all imported goods.. One
does not need to delve in history and
study the laws of political economy
in order to form a conception •of
what this would mean to our coun
try. We need only hark back to
the gloomy days of 1893 4-5-6, when
3,000,000 willing American laborers
were_out of employment. Far better
would it be for the United States to
put up with the evils which we have
with us than to return to those
greater ones of seven years ago. —

The intimation of the Examiner

doubtless without the least founda
tion. Mr. McKenney was an enthusi
astic advocate of the cause of the
senator before nomination. There
was no issue on that score what
ever. The resolutions passed in the
county convention favored Perkins'
reelection, and the delegates sent
from Amador to the senatorial and
assembly district conventions were
instructed to nominate candidates
favorable to. Perkins. Under these
circumstances, it is out of the ques
tion that Mr. McKenney could do
otherwise than give senator Perkins
his loyal and hearty support. Fur
thermore, we do not believe that our
assemblyman is now, or has been, in
clined to waver in his allegiance to
the senator's cause. It is not prob
able that any other name will go

sentative in the United States

LABOR AND WEALTH.
In ihese times of labor prosperity,
and, as a result, of labor, agitation
and unrest,-a number of stereotyped
phrases are being handed around,
intended to intensify the fealing of
dissatisfaction with existing condi
tions. We are told that the work
ingmen are the creators- of all the
wealth of Amador county, and the
inference is that having created it,
they should also be the possessors,
if not of the whole, at least of
the major share, thereof. As an
abstract proposition,' the statement
is far from the truth, g Man' Is: not
the creator of anything. He can
imitate, make and fashion put of pre
existing materials an almost infinite
variety of articles, but he cannot
create. The wealth that has been
developed around us lay dormant in
nature long before, by the handicraft
of man, it was brought to its present
condition to minister to the comfort
of human kind. But the main
trouble is that the word labor when
applied by these agitators in con
nection with weal th is used in the
restricted sense, as meaning mere
manual labor. There is no denying
that labor is king in this world of
industry and activity. But there
are various kinds of labor. In fact,
all men are laborers. It is an en
tirely mistaken idea that the men
who do the commonest kiud of work
are the only toilers that deserve con
sideration. Those who work with
the brain are entitled to as much, if
not more, honor in the advance
ment of wealth and progress, than
those whose energies are confined to
the exercise of muscle and strength
alone. It is in the line of mental
activity— the invention of labor
saving machinery and the harness
ing of the forces of nature to the
cause of human advancement— that
the march of progress is mainly due.
All labor is equally . honorable.
There is nothing dishonorable in any
kind of labor directed in legitimate
channels. The worker that delves
in the mine is just as ■ much honor
ably employed as the man that de
signs a locomotive. But when it
comes to the recompense of labor
that is another question. The price
of labor, like the price of every other
commodity, is governed by the law
of supply and demand. That kind
of labor., which is scarcest is the
highest priced; the grade of labor
that is commonest or the most
plentiful is always the lowest priced.
Genius — and by that term we mean
an abnormal expertness in any de
partment of human activity— always
commands, and as a matter of right
should command, a higher, compen
sation than mediocrity. This law —
bearing as it does the royal sign
manual of nature's approval — has
always held supremacy in human af
fairs. It is in accordance with that
fundamental law of self-protection
which leads every man to secure the
highest possible price for his capital
— labor. Let agitators try as they
may by organization and the force
of numbers to break down this rule,
they can never succeed. Under
exceptional conditions the law may
be disturbed temporarily, but in the
end nature will assert its supremacy
by a return to normal conditions.
WHY THEY COME.
Senator Harris of Kansas visited
Europe' during the summer and, on
his return, takes the stump and de
nounces' the protective tariff be
cause he bought in Europe a pair of
shoes made in Massachusetts for
less money than he was asked for
the same make of shoes in Boston.
According to official returns 648,745
people .. came from foreign lands to
make homes in • the United States
during the past year. It would be
interesting to know how many more
stayed at home because the price of
American shoes is less in Europe
than is asked for the same shoes in *
the United States. It is absolutely
certain that 99 per cent of the immi
grants to the United States come
because they know that it is easier
to get the price of a pair of shoes
here, than it is in Europe, even if
they had cost twice as much here as
there.— Seattle ' 'Post-Intelligencer.
The democrats were for a while con
soling themselves with* having saved
one man on the state ticket from the
general wreck, namely E. C. Farns
worth, candidate for associate justice
of the supreme court. Later returns,
however, rob them of even this crumb
of comfort. Shaw is elected by fully
8000 plurality. Republicans generally
will be gratified at this outcome. Not
that they have any feeling against
Farnsworth. Indeed, in Amador coun
ty he is well-known and highly re
spected, having served the county as
district attorney for one term. He ran
away ahead of his ticket in this county
on account of the personal friendship
and esteem of many republicans. But
Shaw suffered throughout the state,
not because of a lack of qualifications,
but simply because he occupied a
smaller space on the ticket than his
running mate Angellotti. Farnsworth
on the other hand held the vantage
position on the democratic, as Ange
lotti did on the republican ticket.
Hence he ran for ahead in some coun
ties, while Shaw fell far behind. It is
pleasing to be able to state that not
withstanding the adverse circum
stances over which he had no control,
the party strength was sufficient to
pull him through in spite of his tre
mendous loss of votes.

THE REAL MOTHER OF TRUSTS.
-"While the leading topics that!
President Roosevelt will discuss in
his forthcoming message to Congress
will be the tariff and the trusts, it
is- said that he "will discuss them
separately, because he holds with
other republican leaders that the
tariff is not responsible for the
trusts." This is not, however, a
mere party. view, adopted because
of party exigency. It is a truth
that is readily apparent. The catch
phrase of democratic orators is that
the "tariff is. the mother of the
trusts." It would be much nearer
the point to say that prosperity is
the mother of the, trusts. When it
is declared that the. tariff is, the.
mother of trusts the demand is that
the tariff be killed. When it is said;
that prosperity is tbpir source, who
wants to kill prosperity? If there
were no capital there -"would beno
trusts, but who" wants, to "rid the
country of capital? _The'tarjff 'bearer

There was a total of 2806 votes
cast in Amador county at the recent
election, against 2833 polled at "the
election for governor four years ago;
showing a falling of twenty seven.
X)f this number there were 2699
votes counted for governor. There
were more votes counted for tde
bead of the ticket than for any other
office on state or local tickets.
And still there was a loss on this is
sue of 107 votes. - This- loss repre
sents ballots rejected on the score
of being improperly marked, and
perhaps a few that failed to vote for
governor. On this showing it ap
pears that four per cent of electors
failed to register their preference
for governor. A much larger per
centage of failures is shown for
other, candidates. . . For associate
justices of the supreme court the
loss is enormous. Two candidates
were to be voted for, and the total
number of votes recorded is 4280,
which represents 2140 persons vot
ing. Assuming that all who voted
on this issue voted for two candi
dates, we have 666 persons who
failed to record their wishes at all.
This amounts to nearly one-fourth
of the voting strength of the county.*
On the county ticket, the largest
number of votes cast was for the
rival candidates for sheriff.. This
contest drew out 2689 votes- : -only
ten short of the vote on the govern
orship. This shows the keen inter
est taken in that fight. It dwarfed
all other local issues. Even the con
gressional ticket paled before the
interest" taken \a this absorbing
county contest. Only 2588 ballots
were counted for congressmen, more
than 100 short of the vote for sheriff.

Heavy eating is usually the first
cause of indigestion. Repeated attacks
inflame the mucous membranes lining
the stomach, exposes the nerves of the
stomachj producing a swelling after
eating, heartburn, headache, sour ris
ings and finally catarrh of the stomach.
Kodol relieves the inflammation, pro
tects the nerves and cures the catarrh.
Kodol cures indigestion, dyspepsia, all
stomach troubles by cleansing and
sweetening the glanda of the stomach.
Kerr's Pharmacy, Jackson.
We understand that circulars have
been sent from Jackson to outside
points, advising those in search of em
ployment to keep away from Jackson
for a while; and holding out the prom
ise that in the outcome it will be to
their interest to take this course. This
is intended to make labor scarce in this
vicinity, but is really calculated to
bring laborers here instead of keeping
them away. The idea is to get them
to stay away while plans are perfected
to strike for. higher wages. We ven
ture to say if that time ever comes un
der present conditions it.will prove the
most disastrous move for the people, of
Jackson — business men and .laborers
alike — that could possibly overtake the
town. The mines here .would, close.
They Would close not only 'from choice,'
but from necessity. ' Our, mines are
low-grade propositions, and any at
tempt to revise the scale of wages
now existing', would be promptly re
sisted by a complete paralysis of the
mining industry. Now if the business
interests of Jackson want to invite a
calamity of that kind, which means
their own undoing, they can do so by
giving aid and encouragement to the
mischief breeders and agitators who
are now seeking to disturb .the rela
tions of employers and employes.

Deafness Cannot be Cured
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear
There is only one way to cure deafness,
and that is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous lining of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can be
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine. cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.
We will give Odo Hundred Dollars
for any case of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free.

A Popular Appointment.
Fred Jackson, ono of the best known
peace officers and detectives in the
state, is to be one of the deputies under
sheriff-elect T. K. Norman of Amador
county. Mr. Jackson took an import

who terrorized the lower portion of the
San. Joaquin valley for weeks. He was
badly wounded during one of the bat
tles with the outlaws. For years he
has been In the Wells, Fargo & Co.

ning into the mountains, and has
always proved himself a cool, clever
man in holdups. Of late Mr. Jackson
assisted in sheriff Sibley's office while
there was a vacancy owing to the in
jury received by Jailer Robert Hanks.
The appointment of Mr. Jackson as a
deputy sheriff in Amador county is a
very popular one, as the gentleman has
a host of friends not only in the mining
country but throughout the state. —

THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA* FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1902.
SUIT TO RECOVER INSURANCE
Speer Bros. Sue the Scottish Union and
Sational on Four Policies, on Which '
Payment of Loss Was Refused. .
The suit of W. E. Speer and Arthur
Speer against the Scottish Union and
National Insurance Company to re
cover the sum of $1819.32 with interest
at seven per cent was commenced in
the superior court on Monday morning.
A jury trial was waived by both par
ties, so that the court alone is to de
cide the issues involved. The case has
been pending for over 18 month?.
Plaintiffs' side of the case is looked
after by W. J. McGee and John F.
Davis, while defendant's attorney is
J. W. Goodman of San Francisco, an
attorney who is evidently a specialist
in insurance cases, and who is also as
sisted by C. P. Vicinl. The plaintiffs
were owners of Granite station, near
New York Ranch,, and outbuildings
connected therewith, consisting of
dance hall, barn, blacksmith's shop,
and personal property contained thora
in. On this property they took out
four separate policies of insurance, in
the Scottish Union, covering all the
property liable to damage by fire. The
policies wore written by L. J. Fonten
rose, and signed by Mrs. L. J. Fonten
rose as agent for the Insurance corpo
ration. During the night of the 11th
of November, 1900, a fire occurred, re
sulting in the total loss of the build
ings and personal property, comprising
hay, barley, liquors, \ furniture, etc.
The origin of the fire was wrapped in
mystery. The agents of the company
were promptly notified, and au ad
juster appeared on the scene of the fire
about a week after the occurrence in
company with L. J. Fontemose to esti
mate the loss. The policies provided
that in no case should the company In
case of loss be liable for moro than
three-fourths of the value of the prop
erty at the time of the fire. Appraisers
were appointed and an umpire to fix
the value of the loss and the amount
the company should pay -uuder the
three-fourths clause. They reported,
but still the company declined to put
up, and finally suit was brought to re
cover the sum above named, being the
amount awarded by the arbitrators.
Every legal obstacle was resorted to
by the defendants, and twice the com
plaint had to be amended before it was
found proof against demurrer. It
seems that plaintiff had previously insu
red a dwelling on the Speer ranch, two
miles distant from the station, in the
same company, and this. property was
destroyed by fire a few months before
the fire occurred which swept the sta
tion property. The loss on the ranch
dwelling house was promptly paid by
the company. The second fire follow
ing so close upon the other, awakened
suspicion and led the company to in
vestigate closely, resulting in a de
termination to contest. The company
tries to avoid payment on the ground
that It was a fraudulent fire.
W. E. Speer was the first witness, and
was on the stand Tuesday morning and
all day Wednesday. It was brought
out on cross-examination that no
one slept on the premises on the night
of the fire; that no one had lived there
steadily for three weeks preceding the
fire. That his brother was in the habit
of going to the station in the morning,
working in the blacksmith shop and
tho saloon, and returning to the ranch
home at night. That on November 3
a dance was held in the hall, and both
Speer boys were there all that night,
but from that time until the fire no one
bad slept on the premises, except his
brother for one night and he was not
positive about that. He claimed there
was 451 tons of hay in the barn at the
time of the fire; no horses, harness or
wagons', the hall had nothing therein;
two stoves in the dwelling and a quan
tity of barley, flour, liquor and cigars
in the saloon and store, all of which
was destroyed. The witness was sub
ject to cross-examination, but stood
the ordeal without any material Im
pairment of his ovidence in chief.
Arthur Speer, A. C. Barrett, T. Bar
rett, and one or two others testified,
and the plaintiffs closed their case
Thursday afternoon. The defense
introduced no testimony. A number
of witnesses had been supoened, but
were not called. The case was not
argued orally, but will be submitted on
briefs; plaintiffs wavering the opening
brief; defendant to have 10 days to file
brief, and plaintiffs 10 days thereafter
to file answering brief.
There is no doubt, whichever way
the matter is decided, that it will be
appealed to the higher court. The
defense seems to rely upon the failure
of the insured parties to send in proofs
of loss within the time allowed by the
policies, and also on the fact that the
promises were not occupied at the time
of the fire.
Bad Indeed.

ment, for consumption, take Scott's

MINING NEWS.
Keystone!— We understand that C.
E. Bunker has resigned as superintend
ent of tht» Keystone mine at Amador
City; the resignation took effect last
Saturday.
Bunker Hill.— A large ore body,
525 feet in width, has been encountered
in the 1400 foot level of this mine,
which is reported to be of fair grade
milling rock. The property looms up
full of promise of becoming one of the
most substantial bullion producers of
the county. The ledge has been sim
ply crosscutted so that its extent in
length is unknown. It is estimated to
average in value $G per ton. This dis
covery is an entirely distinct ore body
from that encounterod on the 800 level.
Geo. W. Horn, superintendent of the
Horn mine, in Defender district, loft
for San Francisco Sunday morning, ex
pecting to return in one week. He has
tapped the ore body with- the tunnel,
and took down specimens of the rock.
It is of high grade, estimated to go at
least $50 per ton. Tho ledge is two
feet wide. Tho work of takieig out
tullliiig'om will be pushed ahead, aud a
mill, distant only a quarter of a mile
from the mine, will be put in readiness
at once for crushing.
Sargent —At this property the
work on hand consists of running a
drift along the ledge at the 200 level,
to prospect the quality of thi. 1 oro body.
A contract, was let a few days ago to
John Kitto and others to do this drift
ing at $4 per foot.
Argonaut-Kennedy Case! — The
reargument of this famous suit before
the United States supreme court has
been set for December 8. How long it
will take after submission to tho court
before a decision is reached is uncertain,
but it is expected that the 'dual judg
ment will bo rendered within a month
or so.
Rhetta.— W. W. Worthing, gen
eral manager of the Bay State mine,
over in Plymouth district, wont to
Jackson yesterday accompanied by
Charles Krutcher, to whom he made
the final payment on the bond of the
Rhetta claim, adjoining the Bay State.
Mr. Worthing's people bonded the
Rhetta mine some time ago for $15,000
and tho balance due paid yesterday was
nearly $10,000. This transaction no
doubt marks quite an important epoch
in the mining field of that portion of
the mother lode. The Bay State has
at present about twenty men on the
payroll and the mill is crushing steadily
on good paying ore. The acquisition
of the Rhotta adds much to tho value
of. the company's holding-, and judging
from the present outlook the Bay Slate
will soon be a fine paying property. —

Work Suspended.
(/. R. Renno, who hold a responsible
position at the Blue lake camps of the
Standard Electric Company during the
summer, came down from those alpine
regions early last week, and has' taken
a position at Electra until the com
mencement of next season's operation?.
He reports that all work about the
dams of the upper system has been
suspended for the winter. Five men
have been left in charge to look after
the works during the winter months.
Next year, and indeed for several years
to co mo, it is intended to do consider
able work In that locality. In fact,
the improvements contemplated by the
company are merely beginning. The
dam at Deer valley has not been fairly
commenced, only the preliminary work
having been started this year. It is
claimed that millions of dollars will be
spent in increasing tho storage capacity
of the company. A shortage- of water
was threatened just before the starting
of the heavy rains last month, but for
tunately the crisis was tided over by
the timely arrival of a copious rainfall.
The works of the company are running
full force. The recent heavy rains did
no damage to the ditch or the works.
Everything appears to have got down
to a good working basis. This is a well
earned reward. The company has ex
pended a mint of money in this vast
undertaking, and deserves to reap a
substantial harvest for the pluck and
energy displayed in conducting the
enterprise to its present state of
efficiency.

Church Blown Sown.
The high wind of last Sunday week
toppled over the new M. E. church
that was in course of construction in
Pioneer district. The building was
roofod and the siding all on, but lacked
doors and windows. It was mounted
on supports on a side hill and stood
about five feet from the ground. Un
fortunately the supports were not
braced sufficiently/and when the gale
struck tho building it tilted over, and
stands now in such an oblique position
that it is thought it cannot be righted
without taking it all apart, and doing
the work all anew. The cost of this
will be considerable, nevertheless the
community are nothing daunted by
this mishap, but will go ahead and
repair the damage as soon as possible.
Captured a Bear.
W. H. Blakely of Drytown, who
drives his stock every summer to his
mountain range In the neighborhood
of Tiger creek, not far from the saw
mill of the Standard Electric Company,
reports that during last summer he
caught by means of a trap, a black
bear, weighing about 300 pounds. This
is the first bear of that species he has
ever captured in that region. He has
generally caught one or more of the
cinnamon variety every season, but a
black bear is a -rarity. Bears were
more plentiful than usual last summer.
He caught sight of five or six, but
trapped only the one in question. The
bears are caught by a strong steel trap,
the trap itself being usually fastened to
a log. t

Candidates Expenses.
Under the purity of election law, all
candidates are required to file with the
recorder a statement of moneys re
ceived and expended in their canvass
for public office. There is perhaps no
provision of the election law that
amounts to such a howling farce as
this. The law is applicable to all can
didates, whether successful or not.
But in practice only the successful can
didates make any pretense of compli
ance. The candidates are not required
to swear to the statement. Some are
accompanied with, an affidavit, others
are without the force of the oath.
These statements are required to be
made within not more than fourteen
days of the election. This limit ex
pired last Wednesday/so that the
officers elect were careful to have their
statements in the hands of the re
corder before the close of that day.
These statements of expenses show the
cost of being elected to public office in
Amador county as follows:
D. A. Patterson, as county ..recorder
without opposition, spent $75; $50 of
which went to the county committee as
assessment; $20 to the printers for ad
vertising, and $5 to the nominating
convention. '
Geo. A. Gordon, school superintend
ent, paid $40 as' political assessment,
$7.50 for buggy hire, and $32.50 for

of the peace in Sutter Creek,. spent
$7.50, and the printers monopolized it
all. '■■ ' " . .■ ■ - ;-. . ■ :. ... .

$36 of this went to committee, $35 to
the printers, and the balance for hotel,
livery bills, etc.
Fred L. Stewart seems to be the only
defeated candidate who has filed' a
statement. His running expenses were
$123.75. Of this $50 went to county
committee, $10 for printing, and the
balance for traveling expenses.
A. Grillo, supervisor in township 3,
made a winning run on $43; $16.50 for

THERE !S NO SUBSTITUTE
A Serious Time.
There was a serious cave in the
Oneida mine, ln Amador county last
Monday, by which two former Cala
verai men had a close call for their
lives. , Hosea Allen, son of H. G. Allen
of this place, and Jack Stroud, : also
well known- here,' were the ' victims!
They were- at work in an up-raise,
when the ground began to give way,
and sought refuge under a cap. .The
ground continued to fall, nearly crush
ing the men, and cutting off their re
treat from the outside world.
A crew of rescuers was at once put to
work, but the ground was bad to
handle, and despite the hardest and
most courageous work it was fifteen
hours before they were reached. When
at last they were relieved from their
perilous position, it became a question
of how to get out. The ground was
falling all about them, and it was about
as dangerous to attempt to get away as
to stay. .
At length young Allen made a break
and succeeded in getting away safely,
just as the ground fell again, burying
Stroud from sight. It took about
another hour of strenuous work to get
him out.. Both men finally reached
the surface, but little the worse from
their long imprisonment. — Calaveras
Prospect.
The cave above referred to occurred
two weeks ago at the 1850 foot level.
The men were put to work to secure a
dangerous-piece of ground, that gave
timely warning of falling. Before
they could get the timbers in place the
mass of loose debris fell, completely
shutting them in. So thoroughly was
the opening filled that all air was shut
off. The men were thus imprisoned
from 11 o'clock at night until 9 the
next morning. They kept their candles
burning during this anxious time, and
this was a source of danger, as a burn
ing candle will consume as much air
vitality as a living man. The victims
of this perilous adventure escaped with
out a scratch, but with an experience
that will; be remembered by them
through life. ; •

President of State Board.
At the meeting of the state board of
dental examiners held in San Francisco
last Monday, Dr. C. . A. Herrick of
Jackson, was chosen president of said
board. 3 Dr. Herrick was made a mem
ber of the board less than a year ago.
The present meeting is the second he
has attended since his appointment by
Governor Gage. He left Jackson last
Sunday to attend the gathering. His
merits not only as a dentist, but also as
a presiding officer, were at once recog
nized by his election as president, ' ap
parently without opposition. The
honor is well deserved, and the new
president will amply justify by his
ability and tact the confidence reposed
in him. \He is expected home next
Sunday.

Words of Cheer.
Congressman Jas. McLachlan, who
addressed the citizens of this couuty at
Amador City during the political cam
paign, has written to J. B. Tregloan
expressing his pleasure at the visit he
made to this county. He says:
"I remember with a -great deal of
pleasure my trip to your city. It was
one of the most interesting experiences
that I ever had in campaign life. If
the republicans all over the state were
as united and as much in earnest as
the people of Amador City wore, Par
dee's majority would have been much
larger, and we would have had a solid
congressional representation in the
lower house."

A FAITHLESS LAWYER.
l.ccepted a Retaining Fee and Then
Played Ills Client False.
A lawyer tells how he once played a
client false. "I shall have to make a
lawyer out of that boy of mine. I
don't see any other way out of it," de
clared the well known attorney, with a
laugh. "He came into my office on his
■ray home from school and laid a nick
el down on the desk before me. 'What
is this for, son?' I asked. 'Retainer,' he
answered soberly. 'Very well,' said t,
entering into the joke. 'What have I
been retained upon?' My boy dug down
into his pocket and produced a note
from his teacher and placed it before
me without comment. It was to the
effect that he had been 'cutting up' and
advised a whipping. 'Now, what would
you advise?' asked he in a businesslike
voice after I had read the note and
saw the trap that young rascal led me
Into. 'I think that our first move should
be to apply for a change of venue,'
said I. 'Very well,' he answered.
'You're handling the case.' Then we
will turn the note over to your mother,'
said I. I saw the young imp's face fall
at this, but he braced up and said,
'See here, pop, you're bound to see me
through on this, 'cause you've accepted
my retainer, you know!' 'I'll argue
your case before the court,' I answered,
'but'you'll have to accept the decision.
I would not dare to attempt to influ
ence the court.' Well, I pleaded the
boy's case, promptly had it thrown out
of court, and the boy got what ho de
served, a good whipping. It was the
first time I ever played false to a
client."— Detroit Free Press. .
A Gluttonous Boy.
A merchant died at Ispahan in the
earlier part of fast century who had
for many years denied himself and hip
son every Bupport except a crust of
coarse bread. On a certain occasion
he was overtenipted to buy a piece of
cheese; but, reproaching himself with
extravagance, he put the cheese into
a bottle and contented himself and
obliged the boy to do the same, with
rubbing the crust against the bottle,
enjoying the cheese in imagination.
One day, returning home later than
usual, the merchant found his son eat
ing his crust, which he constantly rub
bed against the door.
"What are you" about, you, fool?" was
his exclamation. "It is dinner time,
father. You have the key; so, as I
could not open the door, I was rub
bing my bread against it, as I could
not get to the bottle." "Cannot you go
without cheese one day, you luxurious
little rascal? You'll never be rich."
And the angry miser kicked the poor
boy for not having been able to deny
himself the ideal gratification.
Kind Words .Mean Much.
Cultivate kindness of heart, think
well of your fellow men, look with
charity upon the shortcomings inthetf
lives. Do a good turn for them as
opportunity offers, and, finally, don't
forget the kind word at the right
time How much a word of kindness,
encouragement or appreciation means
to others sometimes and how little it
costs us to give it!
We do not need to wait for some
special occasion. When calamity over
takes a friend, words of sympathy and
encouragement are offered sincerely
enough, yet in certain respects, as a
matter of course. Such an occasion
calls for expression on our part, and
we naturally respond. But why wait
for occasion? Why not speak the kind
.word when there is no special occa
sion?— Philadelphia Ledger.
When the Keys Rattled.
"Ha, ha!" laughed the white key.
"You are fearfully 'sharp' today."
"Well," retorted the accused one,
*Td rather be 'A sharp' than 'B flat.' "
"Good gracious," shrieked the string,
"keep still! I'm highly strung, and my
pedal extremities are affected. I know
I shall break in 'pieces.' "
"So I note," murmured the bass.
'I'm cleft In twain," moaned the staff.
"My trouble is trebled since young
hopeful began to play," said the book
for beginners.
"It's all right while he Is o:«ly 'A mi
nor,' but wait until he begins to be 'A
major. 1 "
And they all started to have a good
"time" with the ' metrouome. — New
York Times.
*Welltni?ton as nil Art Connoisseur.
In his "Ueminisceuces" Frederick
Goodall tells a story of Wellington aa
an art connoisseur. He paid Wilkle
600 guineas for his "Chelsea Pension
ers" and laboriously counted out the
amount In cash. When the artist sug
gested that it would be less trouble to
write a check, the great duke retorted
that he would uot let his bankers
know "what a blank fool I have been
to spend 600 guineas for a picture."
FILTHY MECCA.
Tlie Holy City Is the Dirtiest Spst la
All Islam.
Mecca, the holy city of the faith,
is called by many names. Some call
it "the Mother of Purity," "the Cita
del of Arabs," "the Holy Mosque."
Others speak of It as "the Mother of
Compassion," "the Supreme Sanctity,"
"the Guardian Angel of AJem." The
devout never utter the" word Mecca
without adding to.it some adjective
of praise, suctf as "the blessed," "the
"exalted," "the great," "the highly es
teemed," and so on. The town Itself
is about two miles in length and one
mile In breadth.
The dirtier the pilgrim keeps himself
the more respected he is as a pious
Moslem. Consequently Mecca, being
as it is the most sacred city of the
faith, is literally the filthiest In Islam.
The most Important streets measure
about ten yards in width. The rest
are mere lanes," wonderfully and pic
turesquely crooked and some six feet
wide. The streets were crowded with
tents, camels, mules, asses, horses,
pariah dogs and a motley crowd of pil
grims, unspeakably disheveled and un
washed, while the lanes were abso
lutely filled with every kind of offal
and refuse. Mecca, wlilch lies In a
hollow, would be a regular cesspool
were it not for the pariah dogs, lean,
snarling brutes of a bright yellowish
color, that serve the purpose of scav
engers, and the fierce, dry, Arabian
sun that is the sole sanitary inspector
In the country. The din the dogs make
at night is Indescribable. A pack of
jackals would be quiet in comparison.
Hair Needs Exercise.
One reason why so many men are
bald, according to a foreign medical
Journal, is' because they allow their
hair to die through want of exercise.
Under the skin which covers the head
are several muscles, It explains, and
these; are never stirred into activity,
the result being that they do not per
form their proper function, and conse
quently the skin Js insufficiently nour
ished and the hair gradually dies.
"Women," It continues, "do not be
come bald, and the reason is because
they spend much more time combing
and arranging their hair than men do.
During this operation the skin on the
head is stirred into activity, and as a
result the muscles remain active and
the hair flourishes.
"It is evident, therefore, that the best
way to prevent baldness is to rub the
skin frequently and vigorously, for un
less this is done the muscles' will be
unable to supply it with the proper
amount of nourishment."
John Randolph* Appearance.
Washington Irving when secretary
of legation in London was much
amused at the rollicking good humor
with which William IV. began his
reign, and he once tried to give a les
spn to dignity to the Duke of Sussex.
He had to accompany an eccentric
friend of meager and limping figure,
who persisted in wearing an extraor
dinary nondescript garb instead of the
prescribed court dress to St James.
The ushers demurred; the foreign min
ister smiled. The Duke of Sussex
stopped Irving as he passed and whis
pered, moving his thumb jerkingly up
and down, "Who's your friend Hoky
Poky?" "That, sir," replied Irving em
phatically, "is John Randolph, United
States minister to llussia and one of
the most distinguished orators of
America." It was all in vain. Some
time afterward Irving was dining with
the duke, whose first laughing inquiry,
was; "And how is our friend Hoky
Poky?"— Temple Bar.
Macfcay and Florence.
On one occasion William J. Florence
at the end of a not very prosperous
engagement In San Francisco an
nounced a benefit for himself and his
wife. John W. Mackay happened to
be- 1 in town at the time and wrote to
Florence for one orchestra seat ,It
was duly sent, as a matter of course,
and Sirs. Florence remarked to her
husband that, considering the friend
ship existing between the two men,
she thought Mr. Mackay might have
taken a private box at least "Wait"
said Florence, "he has not paid yet
and I am In no hurry." The benefit
took place, Mr. Mackay came from
Virginia City to occupy the seat he had
taken, and a day later he sent Florence
a check for $1,000.
Kindly Disposed.
The man who had dropped In to see
him was smoking a cheap cigar.
"I think you will find it comforta
ble," said Uncle Allen Sparks pleasant
ly, "If you'll sit over there by that open
window. There Is no draft from It, as
you will see from the fact that the
ptnoke from your ' cigar ■ goes out

about three inches from a hollow straw
(such as is used to suck lemonade) and
to push the needle Inside the straw.
The straw will float and carry the nee
dle. Now observe what happens.' The
floating needle will slowly swing round
till . it points north . and south. The
straw, will behave in the same way.
Push it in any other direction, and the
moment it is free it swings back again.
We do not know who first observed
the fact tlv ' n floating magnetized nee
dle will point io ;iie north. Nor do we
know precisely when or ' where some
unknown Inventor used this idea to
make a compass. All we know Is that
the Chinese made and used compasses
more than 2,000 years ago.
When men began, perhaps 10,000
years ago, to sail upon the water, they
used marks upon the shore to guide
them on their way. Long years after
they observed that a certain star kept
at all times the same place in the sky,
and they used this pole star as a guide.
In steering their ships. Today a steam
ship starting down the Hudson river
for Europe is guided by the pilot and
be uses the buoys, beacons and other
guide marks to steer the ship down the
bay. | Off Sandy Hook be gives up the
ship to the captain; who instructs the
helmsman to steer northeast by east
east by north or whatever course he
selects, and the helmsman, watching
the compass, keeps tho ship headed in
that direction.— Dallas News.

Moral Suasion and a Strap.
"She seems to have abandoned her
moral suasion ideas relative to the
training of children."
"She has?"
"How did it happen?"
"Well, I was largely instrumental in
bringing about the change. You see,
she has no children of her own, and I
grew weary of her constant preaching
and theorizing, so I loaned her our Wil
lie."
. "Loaned her your boy?"
"Precisely. She was to have him a
week on her solemn promise to confine
herself entirely to moral suasion."
"Did she keep her promise?" '■
"She did, but at the expiration of the
week she came to me with tears In her
eyes and pleaded for permission to

THE BALKY HORSE. %
'A Little Trick That, It Is Said, WIU
Start Him Every Time.
For the benefit of those who have
been caused a great deal of anxiety by
a balky horse, lost trains as well as
tempers and sometimes even ruined
th.> liorse, the next time they have the
errrorieuce to ruu across a balky horse,
no matter how bad he Is, let me tell
.you how to start him ninety-nine times
out of a hundred. 7~-'l
Of course it may fall one time in a
hundred. When a horse balks, no mat
ter how badly be sulks or how ugly he
Is. do not beat him. Don't throw sand
in his ears, don't use a rope on bis
fore legs or even burn straw under
him. Quietly go and pat him on the
head a moment Take a hammer or
even pick up a stone in the street
tell the driver to sit still, take his lines,
hold them quietly while you lift up
either frou^foot' give each nail a light
tap and a good smart tap on the frog,
drop the foot quickly and then chirp
to him to go. In ninety-nine cases out
of a hundred the horse will go right on
about his business, but the driver
must keep his lines taut and not pull
or jerk him back.
. If I have tried this once, I have tried
it 500 times, and every time I have
suggested it people have laughed and
even bet 55 and bottles of. wine that I
could not do it. So far I have won ev
ery bet. This may make yoH smile, but
a horse has more common sense than
most people are willing to give him
credit for. The secret of this little trick
is simply diversion. I am a firm believ
er that with kindness and proper treat
ment a -horse can be driven with a
string.— Horse Shoers' Journal. .
The Little Finger Kail.
Forty years ago in certain parts of
the United States it was the custom to
grow long nails. I well remember
some of the swells and puffers who
devoted more attention to their little
finger i nails than they did to then:
teeth, aud often have I seen the fifth
digit with a claw on it an inch and a
quarter In length. The nail was car
ried in a stall, and on occasion was
split after the manner of a steel or
quill pen, so that its wearer could sign
his name to a check with it says a
Writer in the New York Press. . The
trimming of nails today Is an art
which gives employment to many pret
ty women who style themselves mani
cures. Nearly every first class, up to
date barber shop has its manicure,
who delights the man needing a shave
or hair cut with an innocent flirtation.
She dresses garishly and has a strut on
her that would arouse the envy of a
saddle astride fox chaseress.
Where Women Propose.
In the Ukraine, Russia, the. woman
does all the courting. When she falls
in love with a man, she goes to his
bouse and Informs htm of the state of
her feelings. If he reciprocates, all is
well, and the formal marriage is duly
arranged. .If, however, he is unwill
ing, she remains there, hoping to coax
him to a better mind. The poor fellow
cannot treat her with the least dis
courtesy, nor has he the consolation of
being; able to turn her out, as .her
friends in such a case would feel bound
to avenge the insult His remedy,
therefore, if determined uot to marry
her. Is to leave his home aud stiy away
as long as she is in it. A similar prac
tice to that in the Ukraine exists among
the Zuni tribe of Indian^ The woman
does all the courting and also controls
the situation after marriage. v To her.

Unique Venice.
Venice is unique and always as long
as she exists will be unique. The city
is built on 117 islands connected by be
tween 350 and 400 bridges. There are
streets, all very narrow except in the
neighborhood of St Mark's, but the
gondola is the universal means of
transportation. When you leave the
station, you find the Bait waves of the
Grand canal lapping against the mar
ble steps and gondolas drawn up
agalust them like cabs and buses. If
you .wish to keep all the illusions you
have cherished about Venice, enter it at
sunset, at the full of the moon— on San
Marco's night if the calendar permits—
and depart before daybreak. Then yon
,will retain in your mind a picture of
the Venice of song, story and tradition
—the ideal Venice.
She Cornered Him.
The city editor, was troubled, not to

"Hang It all," he exclaimed, as he
read the letter addressed to his depart-,
ment, "my wife has been asking me
that question for the last week, and I
refused to be bothered"— He looked at
the letter again and jumped out of his
chair. "Thunder and guns," he cried,
"it's her handwriting too! Now that
she has learned the trick she'll' make
me settle every social, household and
historical question that comes up, and
I'll be right on hand to take the blame
if I make a mistake."
For a long time he remained buried
in thought Then he resigned.—Brook

PATH OF OCEAN CABLES.
,tibraarlne Tablelands That Stretch
Across the Atlantic.
There seems to be no logical reason
why cables cannot be laid across any
section of the oceans of the world, no
matter how great the depth. Some por
tions of the Atlantic cables are three
miles below thesurface, and this is not
necessarily the extreme depth, for the
cable may .and probably does, pass
from the. top of one submarine hill to
another without drooping
into the deep valleys between',^ says
Llpplncott's Magazine. The greatest
known depth of the sea is 40,036 feet,
or 7 3-5 miles, found in the south At
lantic midway between the island of
Tristan da Cunha and the mouth of
the Rio de la Plata. Soundings have
been made to the depth of 27,480 feet
in the north Atlantic south of New
foundland, and about 3-t,OOQ feet, or
nearly «V 4 miles, is reported south of
the Bermudas. • Even such enormous
depths as these need not hinder cable
laying so' far as the theory is con
cerned, but in practice, for reasons of
economy in maintenance and other
wise, It Is found best to take advan
tage of favoring conditions in the
ocean's bed. To illustrate, all of the
cables between the United States and
Europe run up along our coast until
they reach the neighborhood of New
foundland before starting across to
their destination in Ireland or France.
The reason for this is found in the
range of submarine tablelands, form-
Ing an ideal cable bed, which lies be
tween the three latter countries. - -
The Sea Tront.
The gamest of salt water fish, after
the striped bass, is the weakfish, or sea
tront. The sport of angling for them
is generally enhanced because, feeding
as they genera '!y do near the surface,
it Is possible to fish for them with light
tackle. The best places to find them
In the vicinity at New York are 'Ja
maica bay, the southwestern shore of
Stnten Island and the mouth of the
Shrewsbury river. . While they have
been caught weighing upward of twen
ty pounds, a six or ten pounder is a
good size, and the average will only
run from one to two and a half. There
Is never any doubt when a weakfish
bites. He does not nibble around the
hook, but takes the bait at one fan
swoop and then starts off with it like
a limited express with time to make
up. He is a shy fish, and the man
who uses a small line, light leaders
and snells to his hook and keeps quiet
while fishing is the one who is apt to
have the best luck. — Country Life In
America.' ■ . .

doctor famous for his skill and also his

shopkeeper. This old lady was terribly
rheumatic and unable to leave her
sofa. During the doctor's visits she
kept a one pound note In her hand,
.which duly went into Dr. C.'s pocket
One morning he found her lying dead
on the sofa. Sighing deeply, the doctor
approached, and, taking her hand in
bis, he saw the fingers closed on his
fee. ...
