The" Tranquil Hind.
Who does not love a tranquil heart, a
■weet tempered, balanced life? It does
not matter whether It rains or shines
of what misfortunes come to those pos
sessing these blessings, for they are al
ways sweet, serene and calm.
That exquisite poise of character
which we call serenity is the last lesson
of culture; it is the flowering of life,
tho fruitage of the soul.
It is as precious as wisdom, more
to be desired than gold— yea, than even
fine gold. How contemptible mere
money wealth looks in comparison
with a serene life— a life which dwells
In the ocean of truth, beneath the
waves, beyond the reach of tempests.
In the eternal calm!
: How many people we know who
Bour their lives, who ruin all that is
sweet and beautiful by explosive tem
pers, who destroy their poise of charac
ter by bad blood! In fact it is a ques
tion whether the great majority of peo
ple do not ruin their lives and mar
their happiness by lack of self control.
How few people we meet in life who
are well balanced, who have that ex
quisite poise which is characteristic of
the finished character! — Success.
Taking a Chance.
He looked happy enough as he
walked up to the postoflice box, set a
huge bundle on the floor and began
taking pretty square envelopes there
from, dropping them by twos and
threes into the box.
"Big lot of letters," remarked the
policeman. "Nice day too."
"Letters!" said the happy man. "My
dear fellow, these are not letters.
They are wedding invitations."
A stern look came over the face of
the hitherto friendly policeman.
"My friend," he said, "I am sorry to
disturb you, but I must do my duty.
Come with me."
"On what charge, sir? This is an
outrage."
"Not at all. You arc advertising a
lottery through the post"
The man went along.— Kansas City

The Bnbble Reputation.
The Governor— Colonel, don't you
know Judge Blank? Shake hands with
him.
The Colonel— Ah, you are Judge
Blank of Biankville? ' v; >
The Judge— Yes; Biankville is my
home. .""
The Colonel— Of course I know you
by reputation then.
The Governor— Colonel, don't you
know It always makes me feel mighty
uncomfortable when a man says that
about me— that he knows me by repu
tation?
The Colonel— How is that governor?
Why should it make you feel uncom
fortable?
The Governor— Because, by jingo, I
always wonder which reputation he
means.
A Simple System.
Teacher— ln what year was the bat
tle of Waterloo fought?
Pupil— l don't know.
Teacher— lt's simple enough If you
only would learn how to cultivate arti
ficial memory. Remember the twelve
apostles. Add half that number to
them. That's eighteen. Multiply that
by 100. That's 1,800. Take the twefve
apostles again. Add a quarter of their
number to them. That's fifteen. Add
what you've got That's 1,815. That's
the date. Quite simple, you see, to re
member dates if you will only adopt
my system.
Making; Sure.
This huutiug story comes from Scot
land: When the beaters came out of
the covert, one of the guns said to the
keeper, "Have you got all your beaters
out?"
"Aye," said the man, astonished.
"Are you sure? Have you counted
them?"
"Counted them?" said the keeper.
"Aye, they're all right"
"Then." said the shooter, with a sigh
of some relief, "I have shot a roe."
The Splttlns Snake.
A snake found In Africa Is called the
spitting snake by the Boers. It is be
tween two and three feet long and is
especially bold and active, readily at
tacking every one who approaches it
In confinement It is very savage, open
ing its mouth and erecting its fangs,
from which the poison may be often
observed to drop and even sometimes
to be forcibly ejected; whence the
name given it by the Boers.
Sourcea of Alcohol.
Some terribly potent liquors, it is said,
cau be distilled from the innocent look
ing banana and also from the milk of
the cocoanut The Japanese make a
beverage from plums and from the
flowers of the motherwort and the
peach. The Chinese produce several
qualities of spirit from rice and peas,
all of them intoxicating, besides which
they can make an alcoholic drink from
mutton.
Same Old Thins.
Tom— Did you call on that pretty tel
ephone girl?
Dick— Yes, but I guess there was
another fellow there ahead of me, or
maybe it was only force of habit
Tom— How do you mean?
Dick— My card came back with the
message: "Busy. Please call again." -

WORKING IN THE DARK
Discomforts of RHning Before the
Dny Lamp Was Lit.
The difficulties under which • coal
mining operations were carried on be
fore the scientist Davy had Invented his
Safety lamp must have been very great.
In many times the only alternative the
mediicval miner had to pitch darkness
was the phosphorescent gleam from
dried fish. The miner's Implements,
originally of stone or hard oak, gradu
ally Improved, but he was forced to
work-in almost complete darkness until
81r Humphry Davy by his remarkable
Invention enabled him to light his way
through the tunnels he had excavated
with comparative safety.
Agricoln, nn author who wrote about
the middle of the sixteenth century,
has left an elaborate treatise on coal
mining as it was practiced during the
middle npres. From this we learn that
the horse which survives to the
present day in some of the mining dis-.
tricts of Great Britain and northern'
Europe, was the engine chiefly em
ployed both for lifting the coal and for
getting rid of the water. This latter
object was also sometimes effected by
means of pumps turned by windmills
or by tunnels driven with great labor
to an outlet at a lower level.
Tombs ok tlie Ancient Prophets.
There exist in parts of Islam many
tombs of the prophet Daniel. Of these
one of the most celebrated is at Cairo.
This fact need not astonish us. The
Mussulmans admit without hesitation
the duplication or even indefinite mul
tiplication of the bodies of holy per
sons without their veneration for each
of the remains being diminished in the
least. It is worth noting that the na
ture of the honorary qualifications ac-.
cordod to the same saint varies in dif
ferent countries. Thus, for example,
Daniel has at Cairo the name of Neb
bi-Danlel—that is, they give him the
title of prophet, as being at the same
time that which suits him best aud is
the most honorable they can confer. In
Algeria or Morocco — feudal countries—
tho title they give to saints is sldi,
which signifies lord, which is also the
title there of military and political
chiefs. In central Asia' they give to
those canonized persons whom they re
spect most, as to the prophet Daniel,
the title of khodja, which means In
Arabic writer or lettered.
Making Blarble Out of Chalk.
In nature marble is made out of
chalk by water which percolates
through the chalky deposits, dissolves
the chalk particle by parties and
crystallizes it mountain pressure-solid
ifying it It has been found that simi
lar results may be accomplished by
chemical means. First slices of chalk
are dipped in a color bath, staining
them with tints that will imitate any
kind of marble known. For this pur
pose the same mineral stains are used
as are employed in nature. For exam
ple, to produce counterfeit "verde an
tique" oxide of copper Is utilized. In
like manner green, pink, black and
other colorings are obtained. Next the
chalk slices go into another bath, by
which they are hardened and crystal
lized, coming out to all intents and
purposes real marble.
A Good Policy.
The Dry Goods Economist says of
one store with which it is familiar:
"Every employee in it seems to be
good natured. Why should there be
any difference In this respect between
this establishment and the average
store? Is not human nature about
the same the world over? True, but
there Is a difference. The proprietor
of this store is not only a merchant
but a gentleman. He treats his em
ployees with marked courtesy and con
sideration. As a consequence they
feel so kindly disposed toward him and
bis business that their good will is re
flected In their treatment of his cus
tomers." Some storekeepers never find
out why It Is that so few of their
casual customers become regulars.
Leigh Hunt's Breakfast Bouquets.
Leigh Hunt that early day aesthete,
declared breakfast to be the meal of all
others when the poetic influence of a
table posy was to be desired. He would
bring in a few clover heads or sprigs
of grass culled from beneath the pro
tecting bars of a park railing or city
square if he could find nothing more
beautiful, and with these to look at his
fancy took him roaming out into bound
less green fields and pastures new.
Gave Him a Start.
"Now, then," said the auctioneer,
holding up a pair of antique silver can
dlesticks, "give me a start"
■"Twenty-five cents," came from a
voice at the back of the room.
"What!" exclaimed the horrified auc
tioneer.
"Ah," said the bidder in an under
tone and with a chuckle, "I thought
that would give him a start!"

"How do you get the reputation of

Z ' She 'Repudiated the Charge.
.;At the men's service In a Yorkshire
parish the vicar tried to convey the les
son that the truest heroes and heroines
are Uiose who do noble deeds in the
secret corner of the home, where none
can see or applaud.
"Few of you seem to think," he con
cluded, "that your wives staying at
home uncomplainingly to mind the chil
dren and prepare the meals are
heroines, and yet their touching devo
lion to duty proves them to be so."
r It certainly hadn't struck one old
.fanner In this way before, aud as soon
as he got home he promptly told his
wife that the vicar had called her a
heroine.
}\ "Whatever does that mean?" asked
the good lady.
';; "Oh, it means n woman who stays iv
t' house instead of goin' art to show
hersen." explained the farmer vaguely.
■s,'Then I'm not a heroine, an' I'll

Mark Twain's Plrst Earnlnm.
Mark Twain was once asked by a
friend if he remembered the first
money he had ever earned.
"Yes," answered Mr. Clemens, puff
ing meditatively on his cigar, "I have
a distiuct recollection of it. When I
was a youngster, I attended school at
a plnce whore the use of the birch rod
was not an unusual event. It was
against the rules to mark the desks in
any manner, the i»ena!ty being a fine
of $5 or public chastisement
"Happening to violate the role on
one occasion, I was offered the alter
native! I told my father, and, as he
seemed to think it ■would be too bad
for me to be publicly punished, he
gave me th;- ?5. At that period of my
existence $5 was a large sum, while a
whipping was of little consequence,
and so"— here Mr. Clemens reflective
ly knocked the aslies from his cigar—
"well," he finally added, "that was
how I earned my first $5."

"Well, my man," said the visiting
physician of a Dublin infirmary to a
patient, "how do you feel this morn

"Purty weil, sost," was the reply.
"That's right I hope you like the

"Indeed and 1 do, sorr!" said the
man. "There's only wan thing wrong
in this establishment, and that is. I
only set as much mate as wud feed a
sparrow."
"Oh. you're getting your appetite,
are you?" said the doctor. "Then I'll
order an e^K to bo sent up to you."
"Arrah, ilocther," rejoined the pa
tient "would you be so kind as to tell

The Privilege of Possum.

"Not dis season, suh," was the quick
reply. "Dey roostin' too high."—At

temporarily allaying the pain: Cleanse
and dry the hollow tooth with a bit of
cotton. Then put In a small cotton

Cover this with another bit of dry cot

BESTED THE PARSON^
A Case Where the Wedding Ring
Went on the RiKht Hand.
A clerical correspondent of the Lon
don Express tells of a wedding cere
mony in which he officiated and In his
zeal for rubrical observances laid him
self open to a comical and crushing
retort.
"I was then curate of a small coun
try parish in Somersetshire, and one
day .a couple presented themselves
after due preliminaries for marriage
in the village church.
. "Ail .went well until the moment
came when It Is directed by the rubric
that the man shall place the ring upon
the fourth finger of the woman's left
hand, but then trouble began. The
yokel, apparently from nervousness or
Ignorance, laid hold of the right hand
of his expectant bride and placed the
ring there ivsolutely.
; " 'No,' I said, with quiet firmness,
'you must put the j ring on her left
hand.' To this his only reply was a
stolid stare. Thinking he had not un
derstood me, I repeated my words, but
with no belter effect.
"With as much warmth and in
sistence as was justified by the occa
sion I now took firmer ground and
said, 'If you do not put the ring on
her left baud, I must stop the serv
ice.'
"And then the climax came. With a
complacent smile, that seemed to show
his satisfaction at having for the mo
ment 'bested' the parson, the bride
groom settled the point for all time
with the words, 'Please, sir, she ain't
got none!' "
How Billiards Were Invented.
The English are very fond of tho
game of billinrds, and a letter iv the
British museum gives the origin of the
sport It was invented by a London
pawnbroker, whose name was William
Kcw. Kcw not only lent money, but
he sold cloth, and for the latter pur
pose had a yard measure, with which
he used to compute the amounts. One
day to distract himself he took the
three round balls which are the em
blems of his trade— they may still be
seen in front of certain shops in Lon
don — and, placing them on his counter,
began to hit them about with his yard
measure.
- He found it made a pretty game. He
got a kind of skill in making one ball
glance "off the other, and his friends
who saw him thus employed called the
game Bill's yard. It was soon short
ened into billiards. But the yardstick
was the instrument with which the
balls were knocked about, and difficul
ty arose as to what to call it They
called it after the name of the pawn
broker—a Kcw.— Paris Figaro.
A Bacneldr's Cost of Living.
If the average bachelor, with a mil
lionaire's Income, not the fellow who
goes in for extravagant fads, but the
man who maintains good. social posi
tion and who entertains liberally, were
to balance up his personal account for
the year, it might contain these charges
without comparative extravagance:
House or apartment and service $10,000
Valet 600
Clubs
Restaurant and entertaining 12,000
llothing 3,000
Automobiles 5,000
Chartered yacht 10,000
Cards 5,000
Bad loans 3,000
Horses, coach, grooms, etc 10,000
Total $59,500
These are the more or less fixed
items of expense, and any one who
has ever attempted to keep a personal
account knows that when you have
put down the necessary expenses you
may add almost as much for the
thousand and one things that may be
grouped conveniently under the head
of "incidental expenses." In a gen
eral way it may be said that the mil
lionaire bachelor who spends from
$75,000 to $100,000 a year is living his
life in accordance with the demands
of the time on men of wealth.—Ains

Why the Audience Laughed.
At a public entertainment recently a
conjurer had an experience which was
highly comical, though quite disastrous
from a professional point of view.
Having produced an egg from a pre
viously empty bag, he announced that
he would follow up this trick by bring
ing from the bag the hen that laid the
egg. This little arrangement he left to
his confederate to carry out He pro
ceeded to draw the bird from the bag,
but what was his surprise on finding
that the alleged hen was an old rooster,
which strutted about the stage with
ruffled feathers and offended dignity
and set up as vigorous a crowing as if
it had just awakened from its noctur
nal slumbers.
The whole audience shrieked with
laughter, and the unfortunate conjurer
made a bolt for the dressing room, jg
The Tnnibleweed.
The tunibleweed is a curious plant,
indigenous to the western prairies. It
grows in all directions from a central
stem, making a large flat head, close
to the ground. In the fall, after being
touched by the frost or dried, by the
weather, the stem breaks off, the head
becomes the sport of the wind and Is
driven oft across the prairie, scattering
seeds as it goes and finally bringing up
against some obstruction which arrests
its progress. These weeds have been
seen piled ten feet high against a
fence, driven there by the wind.

Turn round, and, with your back to
the table, ask somebody to throw the
dice. Then tell the person who threw
them to double the number of the spots
on the die on the left and keep the
number to himself. Tell him to add
five, then multiply by five. 'To this fig
ure have him add the number of spots
on the die in the middle and -multiply
the product by ten. ."- -\/-'"-
Then ask him to multiply the number
of spots on the third die and give you
the aggregate sum. From the amount
subtract mentally 250, and the remain
der will show in the three figures the
number of spots on each of the three
dice. For instance, take three dice.
Their numbers are three, five and two.
Double the one on the left— five plus'
five equals ten. Add five, equals fif
teen. Multiply by five, equals seventy
five. Add the number of spots on the
die in the middle, three, equals seventy
eight Multiply by ten, equals 780.
Add number of spots on the third die,
two, equals 782. Subtract 250 and 532
remains, which are numbers on the
dice.

WOULD ABOLISH TARIFF DUTIE{».
Our democratic cotemporary, in
line with traditions of the political
party to which it belongs, comes out
•flat-footed in favor of the abolition
of the tariff. The democratic party,
about election times, is
apt to deny the impeachment that it
is the party of free trade. But as
soon as smoke of battle clears away,
with the democracy in its customary
role of defeat, the writers of that
persuasion throw off the mask, and
"show themselves in their true colors
—as the advocates of free ; trade.
Tone it down as' they please, by call
ing it under various names, such as
tariff for revenue only, raw material
: and the necessaries of life free, and
. a lot of similar hair-splitting distinc
" tions, the predominant idea of free
' trade is unmistakably present, and
the controling factor in shaping their
views. Last week the Dispatch pre-
sented the ideas of one Hazard Stevens
on how the tariff ought to be re-
formed. The article contains nothing
new. It is the same old song that
, has. been sung over the drooping
fortunes of democracy for lo! these
many years, but it serves to show
that notwithstanding all their trim
ming to meet the popular sentiment,
at bedrock, they cling to the played
out doctrine of free trade. This
eminent writer on the dominant po
litical question, claims that customs
duties ought to be abolished on the
following articles, because in some
cases American made goods are sold
abroad cheaper than at home: Iron
and steel, copper, lead and paper,
boots, shoes and leather. On the
following mentioned articles the
tariff ought to be removed for the
reason that they are classed as raw
material: Wool, hemp, flax and jute;
hides, furs and hair; coal, ores, lum
ber, wood pulp, salt, borax, chemi
cals, paints and oil. This is certain
ly a rich schedule of raw materials.
Just fancy, chemicals, paints and
oils being placed in this category.
Then again fish, animals, meats,
sugar, also tropical fruits, and all
kinds of agricultural products are
. also to be transferred to the free
list according to this apostle of re
form. It is not a reduction of tariff
that he wants, because, as he says,
the lowering of duties tends to in
crease rather than reduce the rev
enue. It is the wiping out of the
duties altogether that he coatends
for. With this formidable list ex-
empt from tariff exactions, it "is
difficult to see what products of con
sequence would remain for the rais
ing of any revenue worth speaking
of. The occupation of the army of
customs officers would be gone.
Notwithstanding all their double-
faced professions about election
.'times — and it will be remembered
.that during the last election we had
a sample of how democratic stump
speakers can preach republican doc
trine of protection to suit circum
stances — democracy is the same on
- this vital issue as it was in the day
of Cleveland, Mills, and other tariff
tinkers of the free trade combine.
Tariff smashers have been in the past
the smashers also of industrial pros
perity, and we believe it will be a
long time before the people of the
United States will give them an op
portunity to ply their ruinous call
ing in the halls of congress or
executive mansion again.

UPHOLDING THE BOYCOTT.
Of all tho resources of organized
labor, tho boycott is one of tho most
effective retaliatory measures. Of
course it is regarded as a most iniqui
tous measure by those who aro not
amenable to reasoning, and are made
to feel tho force of that silent, forceful,
cogent expression of popular feeling.
The right of one person to abstain
from patronizing an individual, firm or
corporation, cannot bo denied. That
same right is enjoyed by one hundred
persons, or any other number, tho
Amador Lodger to tho contrary not
withstanding.
Thus speaketh the Tuolumue Pros
pector. No doubt this advocate of
the boycott — the most cowardly de
vice ever conceived to enforce the
barbaric doctrine of "might is
right" — imagines the argument is a
clincher, and effectually disposes of
the question. The reasoning, how
ever, is fatally defective. The right
of one individual to patronize one
tradesman exclusively, or to refrain
from patrouizing auother, is not
denied. When an individual wants
to buy an article, he must of nec
essity single out some particular
place to purchase. He cannot be
stow his favor upon every business
house in towu dealing in that line.
He is compelled therefore to exercise
his right of showing preference for
oue place, or go without the article.
This right is part and parcel of Iris
individual liberty. It cannot be
taken from him without sacrificing
those fundamental principles of
freedom guaranteed by the consti
tution. One man in the exercise of
this inalienable right gives prefei
eoce to oue business house; another
in the exercise of the same right,
and uninfluenced by any outside
considerations, confers his favors in
the shape of patronage upon auother
tradesman; and so the business
world moves, and all manage to get
along. We do not dispute the prop
osition that this same right of indi
vidual preference is enjoj'ed by one
hundred or more persons. We go
further than that and say that it is
the privilige of every man under a
free government. He cannot get
away from this condition if he want
ed to. There is no merit in the
exercise of his choice to deal where
he pleases; there is no demerit in
his passing by a score of business
houses, and his selection of one
favorite. He can't help himself.
Any law that would attempt to sn
fringe upon this right of preference
would be tyranny of the worst kind.
But this is teetotally different from
the spirit of the boycott. It is not
true as a legal proposition that what
one man has a right to do as a unit,
one hundred persons have the same
right to do in concert, especially
where the predominating motive
underlying the concerted action 5s
to either ruiu a fellowman in his
business or coerce him into compli
ance with the wishes of the con
spirators. This is the spirit of the
boycott. It aims to deprive a man
of his right to "Hfe liberty and the
pursuit of happiness." It says vir
tually, you must do business accord
ing to our notions, or you will not
be permitted to do business at all.
It is just as criminal in its spirit as
though it were decreed in secret
council to kill or maim the individual.
If there is no law to reach this sort
of conspiracy, it is high time a
statute was placed on the books to
that end. But it has already been
declared illegal, and only extremists
pf the ultra type will now undertake
to defend the obnoxious business.
Labor unions will have to move off
this dangerous ground if they w'sh
to command the respect of enlight
ened opinion.

"I stuck to my engine, although
every joint ached and every nerve was

As I was about to give up, I got a bot

it I felt as well as I ever did in my life."

We have received a copy of the
census returns of 1900, according
to which Amador county is credited
with a population of 11,116 against
10,320 for the census of 1890, being
a gaiu of 796 in ten years. This is a
slow rate of increase; by no 'rneatis
what it should be considering its re
sources, and advantages in other
ways. Calaveras, out- southern
neighbor, has fared much better in
this respect. She has outstripped
us in population in the last decade,
having 11,200 in 1900 against BSB2
in 1890— a gain of 2418— 0r over 25
per cent. ' i
Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign.
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. For
weak digestion, for defective nourish
ment, for consumption, take Scott's
Emulsion. It restores flesh because it
strikes to the cause of the loss.
The great strike at Keswick is a
thing of the past, and both sides are
jubilant and apparently satisfied.
The truth is the company resumes
work on the terms they laid down
to the striking workmen in the first
place. Union men will not be dis
criminated against, and non-union
men will be employed if the company
pleasesto employ them The whole
trouble has ended in both parties to
the contest assuming the same posi
tion they occupied before the strike
was inaugurated.

THE AMADOU LEDGER; JACKSON, CALIFORmA, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 6,- 1903.
MOVING FOR REFORM.
Supervisor Grillo is "anxious to
brt'ii'. away from the method of put
ting in bills for road work which has
prevailed in this county for years,
and which the Ledger has repeated
ly called attention to as being in
conflict with law. We refer to the
practice of lumping all items for
road work in one bill, and allowing
the same to the road commissioner
iustead of to the parties actually
performing the work.. This week
Grillo presented his first bill for
road work. Ho wanted the items
entered ou the minutes, which, how
ever, was not done, for the "reason
we presume that the account iv the
aggregate was sworn ■to by super
visor Grillo aud not by the parties
themselves, ln fact his bill differed
in no respect from the other road ac
counts, and hence it followed the
course of the others. We trust,
however, that he will follow his ac
tion up by putting in his itemized
bills hereafter sworn to by the
claimants themselves, and we have
no doubt they will, then go on
record in the minutes and be pub
lished as a part' thereof. It is
worthy of note, that the bills for
road work under the system in vogue
iv Amador count}', are allowed and
paid without the district attorney's
indorsement thereon. He does not
indorse them as legal, neither does
be brand them as illegal. Another
peculiar feature is that the warrants
against the road funds have not
been cancelled by the supervisors
the same as other warrants. In our
statement of warrants conceited in
connection with the supervisor's
proceedings, the road funds do not
figure at all. So we are informed it
has been right along. Why this
exception ?
Amador county contains 632 square
miles of surface area. It is one of
the smallest counties in the state.
San Francisco, with 47 square miles,
Santa Cruz, 424; San Mateo, 434;
Marin, 549, and Sutter with 622
square miles are the only counties
with a less area than Amador. The
largest county is San Bernardino,
with 19,947 square miles, being 2J
times the size of the state of Massa
chusetts.

It would seem that the people of all
Northern California are our friends.
Sympathy and regret for the recent
loss by fire have come to us from all
sides. We appreciate it all deeply We
hope that we merit it.
Fortunately our great stock of new
spring goods is but just beginning to
arrive. We have engaged the Pavilion,
Sixth and M Streets, Sacramento, as a
temporary store and will open there in
a few days.
We are filling mail orders as usual.
There is little or no interruption in that
part of the business. ■
Though the liberal and enterprising
spirit of Sacramento financiers, who
have promptly come to our aid, we
shall soon have a finer store building
at 400 to 416 X Street, than we had be
fore.
Again thanking our out-of-town
friends and customers for their count
less expressions of good will, and with
the assurance that we shall spare no ef
fort to attend to their wants quickly
and well,
We are respectfully,

Touching Tribute to Hathaway ■
Our Sacramento letter, which is un
avoidably crowded out this week, con
tains the following touching incident:
A beautiful tribute to the memory of
B. F. Hathaway, who died at the
Oneida mine near Jackson, occurred as
his body passed through Sacramento
on its way to Nevada City, whore it
was interred. Mr. Hathaway had sung
at a numbor of tho rallies in Amador
county during the recent campaign,
and a beautiful floral pioce was sent by
Governor Pardee,' Senator Ralston and
Assemblyman McKennoy, to be placed
on his coffin. It showed that they -did
not forget the services the deceased
had rendered them and their party
whilo alive.
More Accidents.
A slight cave occurred at the 1500
level at the Oneida mine about 7 o'clock
Thursday evening, when an Italian who
is familiarly known as Italian Johnny
was severely crushed by the falling de
bris. He was at once removed to his
lodgings at Ghiglieri Bros., Jackson
Gate,and medical assistance summoned.
Dr. Gall found that he had sustained
serious internal injuries. Hopes are
entertained of his recovery.
Grant Boyd, agod 35, an old employe
of the Standard Electric Company,
while working on the main pipe near
Electra Wednesday morning, slipped
and fell, fracturing his knoo-cap. Ho
was brought to the Globe hotel, where
Dr Gall dressed his injuries.

Editor Ledger: —
Noticing what has recently been
said in the papers in rolatjon to increas
ing tho salary of judges, while I think
it would be a large increase for some
coutitiu*, I am certain there is a very
much lowor, - though very important
otHco, that should receive a decided in
crease of~ salary in souw way best
kuowu to law-inakors. -1 refer to the
office of constable. Here in this pros
porous township 4 we. were unable to
fiud a proper person to take thu ollico'
of constable and attend to thu .busi
ness, simply because there was not a
decent living iv it. Our very efficiont
constable of tho last term, David Gray,
of Sutter Creek, who gave entire satis
faction to everyouu, and who attendod
to his business to the satisfaction of
alfc— just the man for the office — but
who frankly said "ho could not take
the office becauso there was not enough
in it to support a man of family." And
I understand there was considerable
business transacted in his ortico during
his term. Now why not urgo the
"powers that bo" to correct this, and
soe that tho fees are increased to some
decent amount. It is not a pleasant
office. Oft times there aro very dan
gerous matters to bo attended to, and
we expect our peace officers to bo ready
at any timo and placo, and thoy are
roady and willing to bring law-bruakurs
to order. No matter what is done, for
others, something should bo done to
mako tho constable's office worthy of

THE AMADOU LEDGER; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1903.
PIPE BREAKS AT ELECTRA.
Entire System at a Standstill
Early this morning one of the main
pipes leading from the mouth of the
reservoir tunnel of tin- Standard tilec
tric works near Electra, was found to
be cracked and leaking, to a consider
able extent. The place wbero the l.ak
occurred is a little above the Page
residence, and about 1000 feet up the
hill from the plant. As soon as the
break was discovered the water — which
at the point of breakage carries a
pressure of 650 pounds to the square
mch — was immediately shut off at the
mouth of the tunnel, near the top of
tho hill. A force of men have bei-n
sent to the scene, and are now busily
engaged in removing the damaged pipe,
otc. In the meantime the entire elec
tric system of the Standard Company,
from Electra to San Francisco, is at a
standstill, and likely to remain so for
several days. Jackson, Sutter Crock,
and other places have been notified of
the break, and citizens will be com
pelled to use gas or oil lamps until the
repairs to the pipe are fully completed.
The monetary loss to the company,
not allowing for the inconvenience to
its various patrons, will run into the
thousands.
Additional Locals.
Gcorgo Tucker has resigned his posi
tion as foreman of the Kennedy mine.
John Hosking, who was foreman of tho
mine some time ago, has taken charge

John Clute, Ed Santifo, and the
Grillo brothers of Volcauo had a royal
time noro last Friday afternoon. They
had driven into Jackson in the morn
ing in several rigs, from Defender, with
a gang of men from the Standard Com
pany's ditch near there. During their
brief stay in Jackson they visited sev
eral old friends, and had a jolly time
in honor of the 35th anniversary of
John Clute. They returned late in
the evening.
Stevo N. Hughes, a well known citi
zen of Mokelumne Hill, and proprietor
of a livery stable and hall in that town,
was oxamined before the superior court
of Calaveras county last week on a
charge of insanity, and committed to
the Stockton asylum. He was stricken
with paralysis several months ago, and
has since been unable to speak. His
mind also gave way, aud his friends
concluded that be would bo bettor in
the asylum for the insane. The un
fortunate man was an old resident of
the Hill, and well known in Jackson
and other parts of this county.
The first snowfall of the season visit
ed Jackson Sunday aftornoon. It was
barely sufficient to cover the ground,
and not enough to afford the youngster
any sport in the pastime of snowballing.
To the east of us, however, there was
a heavy fall. The entire country above
New York Ranch -was wrapped in a
mantle of white. Six inches fell at
Pine Grove on Saturday, and as much
more on Sunday. Butte mountain re
ceived its first baptism of snow for the
year on Saturday and Sunday. .

bibed somewhat freely, commenced a
disturbance in front of the National
hotel, which eventually developed into
a general mix-up. Subsequently they
had another melee by the Globe hotel,
and as a result three of them were ar
rested, but released later on after
sobering up. The crowd left this
morning for lone, en route .to San
Francisco.

Whereas, it has. pleased Almighty
God, in the fullness, of the year, to 're
move from our midst our brother at
torney aud former judge of the county
court of this couuty, Hon. Armstead
C. Brown.  .
And whereas, wo desire to pay a lil
ting tribute to the memory of our late
departed friend, anil to \ make a ■ per
manent record of our appreciation of
his sterling character, therefore bull
liesolved, that iv bis demise ire
mourn the loss of one who, after serv
ing with the state of Wisconsin, in the
halls of legislation, came in tho Hush
of his young manhood to California,
and helped to lay the foundation of this
common wealth.
That as a pioneer of Shasta and
Ainador couulies he was one of the
creators of the heritage bequeathed us
by that immortal band of empire
builders. That as a member of the
legislature of this state ho for three
terms raised his voice in behalf of good
government in the plastic days' whon
participation in public life meant' so'
much for good or • evil. That as a
judge upon the bench iv this county' he
for three years presided in our county
court aud' had not only the wisdom but
the courage to dispense justice without
fear or favor. That as a mem I mi- of
the bar ho aimed to maintain the best
tradition of the profession,' aiding the
court by his ability, and scorning to
mislead it in the least degree, courteous
to his brother attorneys, faithful to
his clients, stronger to avert litigation
than to promote bitterness and strife.
That in him was exemplified the kind
husband and father, tho loyal and
steadfast friend, the honest and up
right man.
Resolved, that we commend these
thoughts to his family, and we invoke
for them tho consolation which the
memory of his useful and stainless life
will bring them in the coming years.
Resolved, that these resolutions be
spread upon the minutes of this court,
and that the clerk send an engrossed
copy thereof, under the seal of this
court, to the family of our deceased
trjthor. Respectfully submitted,

• . . . new suits.
Dave Mattley vs. George L. Thomas
— Plaintiff claims a right of way over
the lands recently purchased by the
defendant, known as the Clark ranch.
His complaint alleges that for forty
three years he has had an outlet
through this ranch for himself, his
employes, and for wagons and stock.
On the 20th of January defendant ob
structed said right of way by building
and maintaining a fence across it, and
refuses to remove it. Suit is brought
for $500 damages, and for writ of in
junction to prevent defendant from
interfering with said alleged right of
way in any manner.. Citation issued
for defendant to show cause February
3 why said injunction should not be
issued. On that day tho matter was
argued on both sides and submitted to
the court.
First Recruit for State Prison.
Sheriff Norman made his first trip
with a prisoner sentenced to serve a
term in the state penitentiary last Sat
urday. On that day ho took down to
Folsom prison James . H. Hoskins, to
serve a term of 14 years for burglary of
the Mint saloon in Sutter Creek on the
morning of January 21st. He pleaded
guilty to the charge, and received the
above stated sentence. Tho penalty is
differently regarded— some being in-
dined to look upon it as somewhat
severe. It was an exceptional case,
however. He had just been liberated
from the county jail, and bad scarcely
got settled down to. his recovered
liberty when he made this new break
in crime. Although young In years —
being about 20— he showed clearly that
he was criminally inclined, robbing his
own home when he found that the
booty from tho burglarized saloon "was
not equal to his ependthritt inclinations.
The fact that be pleaded guilty, to the
charge did not tell in mitigation of the
offense. All things considered, .wo
think it will have a salutary effect in
doaling out punishment without stint
to those who are disposed to adopt a
criminal career. The young man took
the sentence without showing much
feeling. lie hardly realized the life he
had before him for tho next decade.
With all credits for good behavior, he
will have to spend the next ten years
at hard labor for the state.

..• Benjamin .Hathaway, thtj. young
miner who was caved on in the Oneida
mine about two weeks ago, died at four
o'clock Saturday morning at the resi
dence of superintendent Hampton near
the mine. The attending physicians
entertained little hope of his survival

and other vital organs were seriously
injured. The remains were taken to
lone Sunday morning for transporta
tion by rail to Nevada City, Cal. The
deceased's mother, brother, and sister

on as soon as material can i bo brought
from the city. A circuit between the I '
Zeila mine and the Sutler Creek power- 1 i
lino will be commenced in the near i j
future, and also one connecting the i
Fremont miue with the Ainador power- j
line. The work at tho Sutler Creek

Foreclosure Sale.
.On Saturday H. .D. Emerson; as
commissioner, sold under a decree of
foreclosure, tho Vogt tract of 140 acres
near Electra; The mortgagee was Bolle
Lesslie, the amount duo boiug some
thing over $500. The property was
sold to V. Podesta for the sum of
$G72.92. It is tho impression that the
property was purchased for the Stand
ard Electric Company, as the land joins
tho company's property. The pur
chase price was paid over Monday
morning. The; judgment debtor has
one year within which to redeem.
He has some tuiniug claims in the

time to loosen his grip his hand was
crushed in a : pulley. Dr. Gall was
called, and amputated the iujured fin

While tho rainfall is more than two

probable that the precipitation of last

It must be remembered that February
of last year was the wettest month of
the season, over eight inches falling
that month, with fifteen days of rain.
It was the longest spell of continuous
rains we have experienced for many
years. Over seven inches fell after the

likely that such a record will be equaled
this year, especially after the heavy
rains of tho past month.

Glncli In n Frenzy.
When Gluck composed his Immortal
works, a bottle of champagne was al
ways placed on either side of the piano,
and its effervescence helped to inspire
the great arias of "Iphigenia," "Armi
da" aud "Alceste." When the final re
hearsals were held of the "Iphigenia,"
Gluck liad not yet written the melody
to the "Dance of the Scythians.',' Na
verre, the ballet master, becoming un
easy over tlie delay, went to him one
morning to urge him to hurry |it up.
As he entered the composer's anteroom
be heard unusual and terrific noises
emanating from Gluck's library. He
approached stealthily aud through a
crack in the door saw Gluck in shirt
6leeves, his face as red a& fire and dis
torted by horrible grimaces, singing,
gesticulating and jumping about like a
madman. Xa verre, frightened by the
extraordinary spectacle, pushed the
door open. "Ah, there you are," ex
claimed Gluck. "I am just finishing
your dance and will let you have it
right away." It was then that Gluck
had composed that grand orgy, of the
savages which created such a profound
sensation on the stage.

their patrons go to them for treatment.

Tons of Food For the Atlantic
Commenting on the tromeudons
amount of food consumed ou the aver
age Atlantic liner nowadays, a writer
In the SprtngtJeld Republican says: "At
S comes the monumental breakfast; at
11 the deck steward fills up the coma
tose figures in the morgue with their
•beef tea from those thick, obese Eng
lish cups; at 1 the magnanimous lunch
oou; at 5 the sleepers assaulted by the
(leek steward again; at 7 the awesome
English dinner; at 0:30 a trilling lunch
to ballast you for bed. Besides this bar
baric mounds of sandwiches, olives,
cheese, crackers, perpetually stare you
in -the face in the smoking rooru. Rood,
food, food; the sight and smell of it
pursue the unwilling stomach in every
corner of the place; food tasted, wast
ed, thrown away. There is one port
hole ou the steerage deck, from the
galley apparently, which belches it
forth in a continuous stream— half
loves of bread, great remnants of meat:
we have left a trail of it across the At
lantic. If some one would only esti
mate the tons of wasted food which
are annually thrown into the Atlantic
or could calculate how much cheaper
these steamship companies could give
us our travel if they substituted plain,
self respecting fare for this gilded glut
tony, it would certainly be interesting
and worth while.
The Guillotine and Its Inventor.
One of tlr.> most widely disseminated
of popular errors is that Dr. Guillotin
invented the grim machine which still
bears the name. The real inventor of
this sinister contrivance was Dr.
Louis, a well known medical man and
permanent secretary of the Parisian
School of Medicine, or Academic de
Medicine. ,v."
Dr. Guillotin, who died in 1814, ener
getically but vainly protested against
the use of his name in connection witli
this disagreeable subject — an evidence
if one were wanted, of the great difli?
culty there is of correcting a popular
error. Needless to say that the legend
that Dr. Guillotin was among the vic
tims of his friend's ingenious and mer
ciful instrument of destruction ■is
wholly apocryphal. He died at a good
old age ami in his bed, surrounded by
his children, who, however, obtained
permission to change their name.
Ontn-nrd Show In Italy.
All over Italy social life is character
ized by a great love of outward show.
Here is an anecdote which Mr. Luigi
Villari relates in "Italian Life In Town
and Country" to illustrate this national
feeling:
An American gentleman who was
spending the winter in Naples had
taken a flat in a palazzo, the first floor
of which was occupied by a noble fam
ily in somewhat reduced cfrcum
stauces. He noticed to his surprise that
every day he met a servant going up
or down the stairs carrying a pair of
carriage doors. At last the mystery
was explained. The said noble family
shared a carriage with some other peo
ple, but each had its own doors with
the family coat of arms, to make their
friends believe that they both had
carriages.
Moqnl Village Criers.
Among the picturesque features of
life in tlio Moqui villages are the town
criers, who take the place of the daily
newspapers in civilized communities.
There are two of these functionaries,
one representing the '•hostilea" and the
other the "friendlies," the opposing po
litical parties in the Tusayan villages.
Twice a day these officials ascend to
the housetops and, wrapped in their
scarlet blankets, their figures outlined
against the clear blue sky, call out in
long drawn, resonant tones whatever
announcement or record of town hap
penings may be in order.

Sliver In Potstoes.
In peeling potatoes It Is often ob
served that the outer fleeh of the tuber
contains brown slivers extending from
the surface inward to the depth of
about one-eighth of an Inch. These silv
ers do no harm except to slightly injure
the appearance of the cooked potato.
Usually then* location is Indicated ex
ternally by a minute puncture In the
skin. In some cases each silver %s sur
mounted by a pronounced elevation,
and tubers so affected are called pim
ply potatoes. .
The silvers aud accompanying pim
ples are caused by minute white
worms, the larva; of the common flea
beetle, which bore into the tubers while
they are growing. Naturally silvers
are most common In potatoes in locali
ties where flea beetles are most abun
dant. It is likewise plain that to pre
vent the appearanco of slivers In the
tubers it Is necessary to prevent flea
beetles from attacking the tops. This Is
best accomplished by spraying the
plants very thoroughly with bordeaux
mixture containing parts green at the
rate of about twelve ounces to flfty gal
lons c£ bcivvaux. The same treatment
prevents blight and the ravages of po
tato bugs.— P. C. Stewart in American
Agriculturist.
Chinese Anatomy.
Chinese physicians have some curious
notions In regard to human anatomy.
The truth Is they know nothing about
aimtoniy ns that word is understood by
American physicians, their principal
authority on the subject being a work
entitled "Neitjlng," of which Huang
Ti, who lived from 2007 to 2597 B. 0.,
is said to be the author.
According to Chinese physicians, the
human heart occupies almost the same
position as Is assigned by European
and American physicians to the stom
ach, and bile, they maintain, has Its
origin in the back of the head. They
also claim tlmt a human being has 365
bones, v.'.... . < rrespond to the 3C5
days of the year; that a' man has
twelve ribs and a woman fourteen and
that a man's skull is composed of eight
and a woman's six pieces.
Moreover, they say that In every hu
man body there are twenty-two parts
which are important and fifty-six
which are unimportant, and they lay
great stress on the necessity of taking
good care of the Important parts.

gathers his flock around him In the
most fatherly manner and deals out
justice with an unsparing hand. The
scholars ore dressed in their best, but
must study without their shoes. These
latter are kept In sight of the master
at all times. The course of study Is not
very extensive to look at, but when it
comes to studying the Korean language
through the medium of Chinese it must
be confessed that the beginning of a
course Is difficult. The scholar is first
taught the name ami meaning of Chi
nese characters and then their meaning
in Korean, just as though he were
obliged to Inarn English through the
medium of the Greek alphabet Stu
dents keep up a steady droning noise
as each one goes on repeating his por
tion of the tasks aloud, regardless of
what is going on round him.
Ant**' Magnetic Nests.
Port Darwin, in South Australia,
boasts of some of the most remarkable
ants' nests in the world. They are
known as "magnetic" nests, for the
simple reason that they are without
exception built in a due north and
south direction. Consequently a trav
eler journeying through the district in
which they abound may readily direct
his course by their aid. No living man
knows why these tiny architects build
them in this way. They are merely one
out of the many marvels of the great
land "down under." It seems, how
ever, "probable that instinct leads these
tiny' creatures to so construct their
dwellings that the fierce noonday sun
shall have the least possible effect upon
their interiors.
Tnlkins Through the Body.
To talk through a human body, or a
row of human bodies, for the matter of
that, is one of the weirdest of the elec
trician's feats. If a telephone wire be
severed and the two ends be held by a
person, one in each hand, but far
apart, it is quite possible for two Indi
viduals to carry on a conversation
through the body of the medium as
readily and as distinctly as if the line
had been properly connected.
A Woman's Ileart.
Let men tremble to win the hand of
woman unless they win with it the ut
most passion of her heart. Else It may
be their miserable fortune when some
mightier touch than their own may
have awakened all her sensibilities to
be reproached even for the calm con
tent, the marble image of happiness,
which they will have imposed upon her
as the warm reality. — Hawthorne.

ALMACK'S OF LONDON
A Fuiuouh Woman's Club of a On-
tary or So Ago.
About a century ago the- seventh
heaven of the fashionable world of
London was a club known as Almack's,
of which the patronesses were Lady
Cast k-reagli. Lady Jersey, Lady Cow
por (afterward Lady Palnierston), Lady
Sefton, Mrs. Drumuiond Burrell (after
ward Lady Willoughby), the Princess
Esterbazy and the Countess Lieven.
Their smiles or' frowns consigned men
aud women to happiness or despair. It
Is hard for us to conceive the Impor
tance wbich was attached to getting
admission to Almack's. Of the 300 onl
cers of the Foot guards not more than
half a dozen. were honored with cards
to this temple of the beau monde. The
government was a pure despotism, as
every government by woman is bound
to be, and a host of intrlgnes was set
set in motion to get an invitation.
Very often persons of rank who had
the entree anywhere were excluded
froir. the club. Such as were admitted
had to dress in conformity, with the
edict of the tyrants, no gentleman be
ing allowed to appear at the assemblies
except In Unee breeches, white cravat
and crush hat. On one occasion the
Duke of Wellington was about to
ascend the stairs to the ballroom
dressed In black trousers when the
guardian of the establishment stepped
forward and said, "Your grace cannot
be admitted in trousers," whereupon
tho duke, who bad a great respect for
orders, quietly walked away.— New
York Press.
A Pun That Failed.
At a public dinner a careless waiter
stumbled when bringing In a boiled
tongue. The tongue slipped over the
edge of the dish Upon the tablecloth.
"Never mind," said the chairman
cheerfully, "it's only a lapsus linguae"
(slip of the tongue).
The joke was received with a burst
of laughter. A gentleman present,
who had no knowledge of Latin, yet
saw what boisterous merriment It
caused, secretly determined that he
would repeat the whole performance
at his next little dinner party at home
and give his guests a great laugh at his
wit ' .
The occasion arrived. There was to
be a leg of mutton, and the host bad
instructed the waiter to let it fall when
coming In. • The waiter did so, to the
great dismay of the guests.
, "Oh, never mind," " cried . the host
cheerfully, "It's only a lapsus linguae."
To his great disgust and astonish
ment, however, nobody seemed to sco
it, and now be Is suspicious that some
thing must have gone wrong some
where—Pearson's.
Appenled to the Powers.
The late Joseph Medill, editor of the
Chicago Tribune, besides being an In
defatigable editor, had a decided vein
of humor In his composition.
During the last years of his life, as
his strength permitted, he watched
over his paper as zealously as in his
younger days, and it was his custom to
scan the columns of certain favorite
exchanges and clip from them ex
tensively, marking them on the mar
gins, "J. M. — Must," meaning that the
extracts must go in. It was one of hia
great griefs that there was not always
room for all of them, even when col
umns of live editorial matter had been
crowded out, as they were sometimes,
to make room for them.
One night he went up to the room of
the night editor with a bundle of clip
pings In bis hand. .
"Mr. Ransom," he said to that orß
clal, with a twinkle in his eye, "I .wish
you would use your influence to. have
these printed in the paper tomorrow
morning." — Youths Companion.
A Nourishing: Drink.
The whites of raw eggs are very
nourishing. A good way to prepare the
drink, according to one who knows. Is
to break the white Into a jar with
what milk is desired and shake the two
thoroughly together. A pinch of salt
should be added. An English special
ist recommends to .adult patients suf
fering from anrcinic condition the daily
consumption of eight or ten egg whites.
They can be taken clear and with ease
if the ''eggs are kept very co! 3, broken
Into a cold glass and used at once.
Another excellent drink is made by
beating the white of an egg to a froth
and adding a tablespoonfuf of. rich
cream and a spoonful of brandy. This
Is a very nourishing cordial for an In

. J. B. BELSHER, St Louis, Ma
Sick stock or poultry should .not
eat cheap stock food any more than
sick persons should expect to be
cored by food. When your stock
and poultry are sick give them med-
icine. Don 't stuff them -with worth-
less stock foods. Unload the bowels
and stir up the torpid liver and the
animal -will be cured, if it be possi-
ble to cure it. Black-Draught Stock
and Poultry Medicine unloads the
bowels and stirs np the torpid liver.
It cures every malady of stock if
taken in time. Secure a 25-cent can
of Black-Draught Stock and Poultry
Medicine and it will pay for itself ten
times over. Horses work better. Cows
give more milk. Hogs gain flesh.
And hens lay more eggs. It solves the
problem of making as much blood,
flesh and energy as possible out of
the smallest amount of food con-
sumed. Buy a can from your dealer.
RELIGION OF THE BLANKET
How the Nnvnjo Squaw Prays as Site
Spins and 'Weaves.
It is a religion to make a Navajo
blanket Through the kinky, bristling
twine of the warp are woven the hopes
and aspirations of an immortal soul.
In the warm colors are expressed the
ardors of passionate hearts, 'the sand
storms they have faced, the cloudbursts
uuder which then- backs have bent, the
smiling sunshine that has dried their
ft-ool ; all the adverse and the good for
tunes that have befallen are wrought
into the Intricate designs. The squaw
prays as she pushes the wool card, and
she prays as she twirls the distaff in
her band or rolls It on her thigh; she
prays as she arranges the bealds; sbe
prays as she lustily pounds down the
woof strands with her scrub oak bat
ten.
A blanket Is all a prayer, a human
document, a biography bright with the
joy tints of canary yellow, dark with
the olive green of pain. One is drawn
to it because one's heart Is moved by
its ineffable, inti^gible humanness.
One is strangely moved to both laugh
ter and tears by its exquisitely variant
colors, each expressing an emotion by
its warmth of blended fibers, eacb
throbbing to a note of triumph or of
woe.— Southern Workman;
His Compromise.
Mr. Potter was giving his son a few
words of fatherly counsel as to his
treatment of his young wife. "Now,
when you have any little differences
of opinion," said Mr. Potter In bis most
judicial manner, "if yon can't per
suade Margaret that yon are in the
right, you must compromise, my boy —
compromise with a good' grace."
"I'll try to," said the son respect
fully.
"I well remember a little experience
I had with your mother the summer
after we were married," continued
Mr. Potter. "I wanted to spend six
weeks at Saratoga, and your mother
preferred to spend the time in taking
a trip through Canada. It's thirty odd
years ago, but I well remember the
arguments we had before I compro
mised."
"How did you do it? 1 asked the son.
"We spent five weeks and a half In
Canada," 6aid Mr. Potter, "and from
Friday night till Monday morning Is
Saratoga."
No Need to Adjonrn,
The legislature of a certain state wae
tardy in adjourning one session, al
though there seemed to be no Impor
tant business under consideration.
Judge Jones, one of the legislators,
was met by a friend in the street one
hot morning, and the two stopped to
talk under the shade of an awning.
"Goin 1 -to clear out pretty soon,
ledger.
"I suppose so," answered the states
man, mopping his brow.
"Anything much goin 1 on down at
the capitol?"
"No."
"Why don't they wind up, then?"
"Well, that" s just the trouble: There's
nothing but a lot of petty business to
bother us, and we don't mind that. I
Wish something important would come
up, and then the motion to adjourn
would be In order." .
English In England.
"Yon must learn the shop language
before you can go . shopping in Eng
land," says a girl who has just re
turned from tbere and has many sto
ries to tell of the difficulties met in the
shops. "Shoes are not shoes unless
they are slippers, all boots are high, and
you can't to save your life get a spool
of thread because there is no such
thing— only a reel of cotton.- If you
wish cotton, sheeting for Instance, you
ask for calico, and the tape needle to
run the. ribbons in your gowns Is a
bodkin. There Is not such a thing as a
shirt waist to be bad in all England,
for they have nothing but blouses, and
one would go continually with wet feet
If : she did not learn to ask for ga
loches." I .
Chemical Effects of Lightning.
Lightning works chemically. It has
the power of developing a peculiar odor
which has been variously compared to
that of phosphorus, nitrous gas and
most frequently burning sulphur. Wa

Darien which diffused such a sulphur
ous stench through the atmosphere
that he and his marauding companions
could scarcely breathe, particularly
when they plunged into the wood.—

"Yes, sir," said the commission mer

"Well, If you sell commissions I'd

for my son. I want a lieutenant's com
mission in the army, for my son wants
to be a soldier, and he's too lazy to go
