TOOL THAT ALMOST TALKS
Yet Its Complicated Mci Uanlam Can
Be Tended by a Girl.
The most highly developed of ma
chine tools is the automatic screw ma
chine, and, like many another con
trivance for saving labor, its home Is
New England. It Is a development of
the ordinary steel working lathe, the
Intermediate step being the monitor
lathe. In which the various cutting
tools protrude from the side of a steel
turret like thirteen Inch guns from a
battleship turret In the nonautouiatlc
screw machine the turret is revolved
by the operator so as to bring each tool
Into play. Just as the on the old
Monitor was revolved to bring one gun
after another Into. action. But In the
automatic machine the work is done
without human guidance.
In making screws, nuts, bolts, studs
and other small pieces that must be
turned, drilled or threaded for watches,
docks, typewriters, electrical Instru
ments and other mechanisms all the
operator has to do Is to -feed the
"6tock"— a long, thin rod of steel or
brass— to the machine. The feeding
mechanism carries the rod slowly for
ward Into the field of action. The tur
ret advances and puts its first tool at!
work on the end of the rod. When this
tool has done its task, the turret with
draws it, turns and advances a second
tool into action. Each cutting tool
around the turret has its distinct work
to perform— one cutting a thread, an
other shaping a head, another putting
on a point another drilling a hole, still
another putting on knurling. The tur
ret automatically brings each of per
haps six tools into action, and when
the work Is finished the completed
screw drops Into a pan, while the
"stock" Is automatically fed forward
to begin the complex operation again.
A stream of machine oil pours contin
uously on the work to carry away the
heat and the little metal cuttings coU
lect in a heap under the machine.
Hour after hour this wonderful au
tomaton goes through its cycle of oper
ations, the turret clicking every mo
ment as It brings a new tool forward,
Small brass pieces, on which but one
tool cuts, are dropped at the rate of
four a second. Large screws of com
plicated design upon which a whole
turretful of tools must work are cut
from a steel rod at the rate of one or
two a minute. So perfectly are these
screw machines constructed that an un
skilled workman can operate a row of
them. All he is required to do is to keep
them fed with "stock." In some shops
girls tend the machines.— Success.

fSffectlvo, hut Dangerous.
To cleanse glass vases, carafes as botr
ties of any sort nothing is better than a
little' muriatic add. A tablespoonful
rinsed slowly around In a vase or de
canter will cleanse It thoroughly, re
moving from the glass every particle of
foreign matter. The add can then be
poured into another vase to perform
the same office and even then returned
to the bottle of supply for 'service oii
another occasion. After the add is out
of the vase or bottle the latter must
be rinsed inside thoroughly first with
hot soapsuds and then in several clear
waters. Muratic add is a deadly poi

tion and only by an Intelligent adult.

Paper limiting:.
One of the most exciting of all rid
ing games is paper hunting, or follow
ing a trail made by dropping pieces of
paper. It can be made as dangerous
as.'steeplechaslng or no mure so thaty
an ordinary gallop over the fields. The
danger ls^ln the fences to be ridden
over, says Country Lifa In America.
There Is no limit to the pace but the
speed of the leading horse and the ng;
cessity of keeping the trail. The "bare,"
as the man a-horseback who lays the
trail Is called, Is expected to foil his
pursuers, the "hounds," as often as he
can by the arts of the fox or by his
own Ingenuity, only restricted by cer
tain rules of the game.

The American climate, with its ex

turers have hit upon the expedient of
leaving a space between glass and
frame in order to. allow for contrac
tion and expansion. ,

CUTTING HIMSELF OFF;
B»e Slant Way In Which rtmpljrta
;c. Cannon Refused a Fortune. 1 "^
; The Rev. Edward Cannon, a ' chap
lain to King George IV., was a dog
gedly independent man. On one occa
sion he refused to compliment his roy
al master on hie singing and for. a
time fell into disfavor. . His .manner
.waa high handed and not alivaja too
courteous, but his actions' were always
on the side of right and justice. .The
biography of his friend Barham, the
author of the "Ingoldsby Legends,"
contains, among -other anecdotes of
Cannon, the story of how he disinher
ited himself.
A silly old lady summoned him to
her house and pretended to be declin
ing in health. She told him she had
made her will, by which the whole of
a considerable fortune was to be leti
to him. ' • ■ - ." ■■• .
j^"l.don't Delieve it," said Cannon aft
er a pause, in which he eyed her
doubtfully. The lady assured him that
the document was lying In a desk in
the room. •
"I won't believe It," persisted Can
non, "unless I see it"
Smiling at his Incredulity, she placed
the will in his hands. Cannon read it
"Well," he said deliberately, "if I
had not seen it In your own hands, I
could not have believed you were such
an unnatural brute."
Thrusting the paper between the bars
of the grate, he continued In a severe^
low voice: "Have you no one more
nearly connected with you than I— no
one to whom your money should go,
who has a right to be provided for
first and best? Pooh! You don't
know how to make a wllL I'll send
for a lawyer, and he shall make your
will. You shall leave me a^egacy.
There's no harm In that, but I'm not
going to take It all to please you.

ELECTRIFIED HOUSES.
Tlie Simple Explanation of a Very
Ordinary Phenomenon.
An Instance of nonfamillarity with
simple scientific facts is illustrated by
an article that goes the rouuds of the
press once or twice annually— namely,
the story of the electrified house. The
article usually states that some one
has discovered that ' everything he
touches in his house — the radiators,
picture frames, banquet lamps, etc.—
gives him an electric shock; hence he
fears there Is some connection between
the arc light wires and the water pipes
near his residence. The electric light
inspector Is therefore summoned and
reports that the wires of his company
are intact and that the electricity must
come from some other source.
It does not dawn on any of the peo
ple consulted that the discoverer of
the phenomenon is unconsciously per
forming one of the simplest and oldest
of electrostatic experiments, the shuf
fling of his shoes over tlie pry carpet
raising the potential of his body to
several thousand volts, which discharge
at every opportunity. One may even
get ejeptric discharges from his knuc
kles against the brass lock of a hand
bag which he may be carrying while
walking on a stone pavement during
cold, dry weather.
But, dismissing newspaper science,
it Is somewhat astonishing, in view of
the many ways In which In cold, dry
countries electricity is unintentionally
developed and manifested by spark
ing, that the first knowledge concern
ing this phenomenon did not come to
the ancients In this way rather than
by the attraction of light substances
by amber. The explanation of this,
however, may be that the scientists of
bygone days did not reside in cold, dry
countries.— Cassler's Magazine.
When to Bat Krnlt.
t
The question is often asked, At what
time of day should fruit be eaten? In
tropical countries, where fruit is the
chief article of food, the rule appears
to bejthat the earlier in the day It Is
taken the better and the later the
worse. In hot weather many wjse
people will eat none after noon, alleg
ing that the digestion then declines In
power with the decline of the day and
the fruit, instead of digesting, decom
poses owing to the presence of the sac
charine matter. The objection to fruit
and certain kinds of vegetables late in
the day, be {he expjanaflqn what ft
may, la certainly Justified by an ample
experience, though some persons can
eat fruit at all hours without feeling
any Inconvenience. — Table Talks.
A Plea For Courtesy.
We have lost the old flowery forms
pf politeness, and now ye never i?aste,
"Thank ybu!"on a fellow creature who
is not of our own immediate circle. A
tradesman does, but he knows it will
be charged In the bill. I wonder what
will bring us back to the old sweet
ness of manner? Why should not the
customer In the teashop or the custom
er in the postofflce say "Please" when
he gives his order and the other spare
a "Thank you!" when he has paid his
bill? It makes life run so much mare
tasily.— Girl's Realm.

The Shortest lived City.
Which of the large cities of the world
had the shortest life?
In the ancient world the answer Is
Palmyra. The period of Its prosperity
extended only from 117 to 273^A. D.,
156 years. In the fifth century B. C.
PersopoUs was the capital of the Per
sian empire for thirty years only, but
this was merely an accident of war
and politics. Carthage was the shortest
lived seat of empire, for it only en
dured about 500 years. In modern times
the answer would be Amarapura, the
former capital of Burma. Founded in
1783, it had In 1800 a population of
175,000. Sixty years later the seat of
government was transferred to Man
dalay, and Amarapura is now repre
sented only by a few ruined temples
and bamboo huts.— London Answers.

PLACEBO PRESCRIPTIONS.
An Old Doctor Tells a Secret of Hla
Proxesalon.
"Never tell a patient that there Is
nothing the matter with him," said the
old doctor, who was revealing the se
crets of his profession. "If you do, you
make a lifelong enemy and lose your
patient, who sends for another doctor.
Give him something, if it is only flavor
ed water. If the disease is only imagi
nary, cure the imagination ! with a
harmless dose, and your , patient gets
well. In the profession we call such
prescriptions "placebos,' and more won
derful cures are effected by placebos
than the world wots of. So, also, when
you run across a patient who an
nounces the first thing that he cannot
take certain sorts of medicine, don't
tell him he must. Agree with him and
give him the medicine, -if he needs It,
hi a disguised form.
"There are thousands of people who
labor under the conviction that they
cannot take quinine and will tell you
that they have never taken It in their
lives, while at the same time they may
be taking large doses of It. The taste
of quinine is hard to disguise, but- if
administered in a pill the patient can
be made to take it and never suspect

Seven thousand years ago there were

man's work was strictly defined, and
even the number of hours that he was
allowed to work; was stated in the
charter of his guild or union. Later

isted in Pompeii, and inscriptions have
been discovered stating j specific »p>

to have been that of the Fishermen's

GEORGE C. PARDEE, of Oakland
Congress, J. N. GILETTE, Humboldt
SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT.
Our attention has ! eon called to
an iuaccurancy in cur article pub
lished last week on the caudidacy of
Geo. F. Mack. The article conveys
the idea that Mr. Mack's / salary for
the time he was school superintend
ent, was $600 per year. The law
provided that if the superintendent
devoted his whole time to the duties
of the office his salary should be
$1200; otherwise $600. In August,
1893, Mr. Mack attended to the
duties of his office exclusively, and
from Aug. 21, 1893,,t0 the end of his
official term in January, 1899, he
drew $100 per month, the same as
the present superintendent's salary
for the current term. The office of
superintendent of schools is not a
bonanza. Considering the amount
of work involved, it is by long odds
the poorest paid office in connection
with the county government. The
Ledger has"no complaint to make
against the gentleman now filling
that position. We are free to admit
that he has been painstaking and
scrupulously conscientious in the
discharge of his duties. We have
never intended any remarks iv these
columns advocating the support of
Geo. F. Mack as reflecting in any
way upon the present incumbent.
While we differ from him on party
issues, we trust we are not so blindly
partisan as to be incapable of recog
nizing a capable democratic official.
We willingly concede that. Geo. A.
Gordon has lived up to the strict
letter of the law, according to his
interpretation thereof. More than
this, we give him credit for holding
aloof from cliques or combinations,
and running his office according to
the dictates of his own judgment.
But while admitting all this, we be
lieve that Geo. F. Mack possesses
all the requisites of a faithful and
successful head of ; the educational
department, and therefore we are in
duty bound to support and to
urge upon every republicau to sup
port him by vote and influence. ■' -C.
HOW CONSISTENT.
v - Many voters now in the county
have a distinct^ recollection of the
first canvass of U. S. Gregory for
sheriff ten years ago. In that cam
paign he told the people substan-.
tially as follows: "I have nothing to
: say against my opponent, R. J.
Adams. He is a gentleman. The
only trouble is, he has been in office
too long. I promise you when I
have held the office as long as he
has, I will not ask for your support
again." After a term of two years,
he was a candidate for re-election,
and again informed the people that
a term of four years more would ap
pease bis thirst for office. An in
dulgent public gratified his ambition
again. After the lapse of four years
he comes to the front with his mod
esty unruffled, asking for four years
more of the fattest berth connected
with the county government — con
siderably fattened too by legislative
manipulation since he has filled the
position. Of course, that would be
the last time he would ask for their
suffrage. A confiding people grant
ed this favor, owing to very excep
tional circumstances existing at that
time. So that Mr. Gregory has
filled the sheriff's office for a much
longer period than any other man in
the history of Amador county. But
even ten years of continuous service,
at a princely salary, has failed to
convince him of the advisability of
a much-needed rest. He is stump-
Eing for another four years — which
would make more than double the
official term of his predecessor —
which he denounced as too lengthy
ten years ago. And the peculiar
phase about it is that this prolonged
career has been the most arbitrary
and unpopular the county has ever
known. Citizens — republicans and
democrats alike — have about come
to the conclusion that the only effec
tual way of suppressing this peren
nial craving for office is to beat him
at the ballot-box — and beat him
badly.
• The legislative ticket ; has special
claims for support. Party principles
are an issue in the election of state and
national legislators.' The continuance
of the present era of prosperity, is de
pendent upon the continued supremacy
Of republican policies. On no specious
plea whatever should any republican be
lured from voting for Gilette for con
gress, Ralston for state senator, and
McKenney for assemblyman.

HOVy IT GROWS.
We have heretofore called atten
tion to the practice, which may
almost be said to have grown to a
settled policy, of having defendants
in criminal cases plead guilty. The
only object a person accused of crime
could have in makiug a plea of
guilty, is to get a lighter sentence.
And the only argument that has or
can be urged from a public stand
point in favor of the "plead-guilly"
system, is that. -the expense of a
trial is thereby avoided. It. is as
sumed that this manner of disposing
of criminals without trial, is popular
with taxpayers because of economy.
We have no hesitation in expressing
the opinion, that it is neither
economical nor popular, and further
more that it is unjust and agaiust
the spirit of the law. To show how
this'business has grown to serious
proportions hi Amador count}' of
late years, we have taken the trouble
to examine the records of the su
periorjeourt for the past eighteen
years.^ Dividing this time into two
periods-*-one covering from January,
1885, ufitil January, 1893, eight
years; the other extending from
January, 1893, to the present time,
nearly ten years. The latter repre
sents the term of office of the present
sheriff, U S Gregory. In the tirst
named" period we find 32 criminal
cases entered on the register. CJf
these 24 stood trial, and S pleaded
guilty. Of those included in the
latter, one case is in doubt, because
the outcome is not^teted in the
register; but we let it stand as a
case of admitted guilt. Of the 8
cases two were Chiuamen and one
an Indiau. Of the remaining five
cases, two were represented by at
torneys, leaving ouly three instances
of white men being sent to state
prison without the benefit of an at
torney to look after their interests.
Now let us turn to the other
period. From January, 1593, to the
present time, the criminal calendar
shows a total of 83 cases — an
average of Si per year against four
per year for the precediug eight
years. Of these, 39 defendants
availed themselves :of their legal
right to a jury trial by a plea of
not guilty; while 44 v were led to
plead guilty. As compared with
the first named period, the trial
cases increased about 50 per cent,
while the confessed guilt cases in
creased at the rate of over 450 per
cent. _In other words, under the
present regime, from some cause
or other 4J times as many per
sons~are punished on a plea of guilty
than was the case prior to 1893. It
is also interesting to note that in
nearly all these cases 'of "guffty"
from the lips of. the defendant, the
accused has been unrepresented by
an attorney. In this regard we have
not had time to segregate them.
Nor can it be truthfully said that
this increase of criminal cases is due,
not so much to iucreased crime, but
to greater diligence and success on
the part of the peace officers m the
ferreting out of crime. If anything
the reverse of this proposition would
be nearer the truth. It is always
the case, that a large percentage of
crime goes' undetected aud unpun
ished. This will coutinue no matter
who is in office. All that can be de
manded is that the, peace (officer do
his utmost, without fear or favor, to
unravel crime, and convict the
offender in accordance with law.
It is inconceivable that the radi
dal departure in criminal procedure
which we have outlined "has come
about without cause. It is beyond
our province to look into the secret
springs of the change between the
administration of the present and
the past. ' All' we can do is to point
to the record, and let our readers
draw their own conclusions. It is
undeniable that a difference is made
in the degree of punishment meted
out to one who pleads guilty and one
who stands trial. To illustrate this
we cite one instance. Christenson
and Gotaw were charged with grand
larceny committed at Tabeaud reser
voir. They were both involved in
the same affair. Christenson was
looked upon as a hard character, and
the head and front of the offense.
But he pleaded guilty, aud was given
two years. His companion Gotaw,
concluded to stand trial. He was
convicted. He got seven years.
It is not for us to discuss motives.
The object of this policy appears to
be either a morbid desire to popu
late state prisons, or to encourage
defendants to plead guilTy-and there
by save expense of prosecution. The
first is unworthy of notice. The lat
ter is fallacious. Instead of beiii"
< o
economical, it is the most costly, as
well as unjust system that could be
adopted. In Sacramento county a
self-confessed convict is dealt with
on the same plane as one whostauds
trial. The result- is Sacramento is
pretty well rid of the criminal class.
The chronic law-breaker steers clear
of the county where he knows if de
tected he will receive adequate pun
ishment. He prefers to operate
where he will be lightly punished;
even though he has to plead guilty
to secure it. He can thereby commit
three crimes and get the punishment
of one, with the chance of escaping
detection altogether. In this way
Amador county by the procedure
outlined, offers an asylum for those
confirmed in crime, and judging from
the increase of crime siuce the policy
has been started, they are making
use of its territory as «a place of
refuge. Voters of Amador county,
it is for you to say whether this
peculiar system shall'take deeper
root here, or be eradicated by dis
solving the political combine" that
has fostered it.
THE AMADOU LEPGKEB: JACKSON, CALrFORNIA, FliTf>AY, OCTOBER 24. 1902.
A PAGE FROM THE PAST.
It is being said, in" some quarters
that the office of county clerk: is a
non-political one." Those of that be
lief must be ignorant of Amador's
history in rocent years. The fact is,
every elective office in the couuty —
froi-n ]udge to constable— is a politi
cal office, and all are used more or
less in a partisan spirit. Perhaps
it is unfortunate that it is so. But
every county official is expected to
bestow favor or patronage upon his
party friends, and there can be no
valid objection to this course so long
as it is confined within reasonable
and legal limits. There is more
politics in the clerk's office to the
square foot than all otner offices
combined, the sheriff's office alone
excepted. The case of Dwyer vs.
Garbarini is still fresh in the public
minds 1 . V. S. Garbarini was de
clared elected by the official board of
canvassers as supervisor iv town
ship one, in November, 1896. He
won by four votes. He was the re
publican nominee, and by taking his
seat the complexiou of the board of
supervisors would have been changed
from democratic to republican. He
was given a certificate of election by
the county clerk. The margin was
too small to forgo a contest. Suit
was commenced., and at the trial 24
Garbariui voles were thrown out as
illegal, aud Dwyer was declared
elected by 9 votes. It is too long a
story to go into details of the many
reasons why votes were rejected.
Garbarini filed a notice of appeal,
accompauied by a bond of costs.
On the 4th of January, 1897, V. S.
Garbarini appeared before the board
and asked the clerk to place his name
on the roll call, as he had a right to
do pending the result of the appeal.
Here is what occurred, and we ask
all fair-minded citizens to ponder
over the record here given, and the
reason assigned for refusing to place
Garbarini's name on the roll. The
minutes of the board of that date
read as follows:
. P. Dwyer instructs the clerk to call
his name as a member of the board,
which the clerk refases to do.
V. S. Garbarini asks the clerk if he
has in his possession a certificate ol
election issued to him, said V. S. Gar
barini as supervisor of township one by
said clerk in pursuance of the order of
the board of supervisors made Nov. 9,
1596, whereupon the clerk answered
that he had, and identified the certifi
cate of electiou of said V. S. Garbarini.
He stated that it was returned to him
and filed Nov. 17, 1896. V. S. Gar
barini asked the clerk to read said cer
tificate of election, together- with the
endorsement thereon, and then taplace
his name on the roll of the board of
supervisors, and to call his name as en
rolled, and to recognize said certificate
of election; whereupon the clerk read
said certificate of election together with
the oath thereon, of said V. S. Gar
barini, and tho endorsement thereon,
and thereafter refused to place said
name of V. S. Garbarini on said roll,
or to call the same, or to recog
nize said certificate together with said
oath and endorsement thereon, and
stated his reasons for the same.
seven o'clock on the evening of
tho same day, V. S. Garbarini presents
again the certificate of his election and
official bond, and his qualifications as
supervisor, together with the ondorse
mout thereon, and demands that the
clerk recognize the same, and place his
name upon the roll as a member of the
board of supervisors elected at> the
election of November 3, 1896, which
the clerk refuses to do, and states his
reasons for so doing, to wit, because he
believes P. Dwyer should hold over
until V. S. Garbarini is declared duly
elected by the supreme court of the
state of California.
Judgment in case No. 1338 Dwyer vs.
Garbarini, the certificate of election
and qualifications of P. Dwyer and his
official bond is offered in evidence to
the board of supervisors by W. J. Mc-
Gee, attorney for P. Dwyer.
The notice of appeal in the case of P.
Dwyer vs. Garbarini filed January 5,
1597, and the undertaking for costs and
damages on appeal is offered in evi
dence to the board, by John F. Davis,
attorney for V. S. Garbarini.
After due consideration by the clerk
the name of P. Dwyer is placed upon
the roll of the board, and his name is
called as a member of the board of
supervisors, retaining said office as a
hold-over.
A person can continue in office as
a holdover only when a vacancy oc
curs by reason of failure to elect, or
of the person elected to qualify. It
is^not contended that either. of these
conditions arose in this supervisor
case. It will be noticed that the
clerk would not recognize the Gar
barini certificate as valid, neither
did he take the position that the
Dwyer document, issued by order of.
the superior court, entitled the con
testant to the seat pending decison
by the appellate court. Both cer
tificates were ignored, on what legal
grounds we do not know. But
Dwyer's name was called as a hold
over,- which from the standpoint of
practical politics amounted to the
same thing. Garbarini was kept
out of the seat, the board was kept
democratic aud one of the main ob
jects of the appeal was thereby de
feated: The record is submitted to
the voters for their. calm considera
tion.
Caldwell for District Attorney.
. J. W. Galdwell is energetically push
ing his claiccs for support for district
attorney, and meeting with strong en
couragement. He is a level-headed,
conservative man, and a legal pract
itioner of several years' standing. No
office in the local government demands
firinnessNand self-reliance to a greater
degree than the district attorneyship.
In his speech of acceptance, Mr. Cald
well, without intending any reflections,
said if elected ho would be district at
torney. That is, he would be gov
erned solely by the law, and the best
interests of the county. That is the
right spirit. Vote for Caldwell. He

How is This.
By the statement of the license col
lector for the quarter ending Sept. 30,
1902, which was presented to the board
of supervisors at its last meeting, and
published in the Ledger last week, it
will be noticed that no revenue from
theatre or show licenses of any kind
was collected during that quarter. No
licenses of this kind were received from
the auditor, none sold by the collector,
and no unsold licenses roturned to the
auditor. We are not aware that the
license ordinance has been amended, so
as to place traveling shows on the free
list. ■We do know, however, that for
the month of Sept., theMorell Com
pany played in Plymouth, Amador
City. Sutter Creek, Jackson and lone,
staying about a week in each town. By
the ordinance, the license for shows is
$2.50 per night or slo per week. If the'
ordinance is a dead letter in this re
gard, why not wipe it from the book?
The company played only five nights
in Jackson, giving up the Saturday
night on account of the democratic
meeting.
F. L. Stewart is entitled to the unan
imous support of republicans for super
ior judge. It has not been, and cannot
be said that he is not qualified in every
way. He is too young, they say. He
is now 33, and getting older every day.
If the judgment is not mature at that
age it never will be. The greatest lifo
work recorded in all history was under
taken at that age. That effectually
disposes ol the 'too-young' objection.
Dr. B. T. Freshman of Amador City,
nominee for coroner and public admin
istrator on the republican ticket, is
making the tour of the county with
the other candidates. He is a medical
practitioner of standing, which of itself
is a strong recommendation for the
position of coroner. He asks the active
support of every man in his party. .
Tom Norman is making a phenomi
nal canvass for sheriff and tax
collector. He has tried to see every
voter in the county. If there • are
any in the county who are not per
sonally acquainted with him, we
hope they will make it a point to see
him. They will find him a plain,
honest, industrious, common-seuse
business man, in the prime of life,
qualified in every way for the office
he seeks, and a gentleman at all
times. The duties ot the combined
offices of sheriff and tax callector
could not be entrusted to better
hands than his. _j
It is needless to remind the peo
ple that Johnny Glute of Volcano is
an aspirant for the county clerk
ship. Clute is making a clean,
earnest, and thorough canvass, and
meeting with encouragement. No
one can truthfully say that he is not
as well qualified for the place by edu
cation, business experience, and in
tegrity as any man in the county.
He is young and ambitious. He ac
cepted the nomination at the earnest
request of republicans, who were
anxious that this place on the ticket
should be filled by a strong and
active candidate. No man on the
ticket is more deserving the solid
support of his party than he. The
personal worth of thecaudidate, the
exceptional circumstances under
which he entered the list of nomi
nees, and the thoroughness with
which he tobk up the task, ought to,
and we believe will, secure the loyal -
ty of all republicans, and also of
-those who think that a change is in
order anyway. By electing Clute
for clerk the people. will make no
mistake.
A. Grillo is making a gallant fight
for supervisor in the third district.
He is entitled to the support of every
true republican. Nothing can be
said against his fitness for the office.
He is energetic, and of good busi
ness qualifications. The voters of
that district should stand by him,
and elect him by a majority that will
forbid any contest in the courts.

Judge Rust has navor neglected any I
duty sinco he has been a public servant '
and the Lodg-or well knows it. — Anui-I
dor Record.
Our cotemporary would better
confine its attention .to what it
knows itself, without presuming to
know wlki' \-.\- -s know. The Led
ger makv. l s no preteusiou to mind
reading. The editor of the Record
has been absent from the county the
greater part of the time sinco R. C.
Rust became superior judge. He
has been in San Francisco running a
mining paper. And yet he assumes
to know not merely all that has
transpired in official circles in Ama
dor county during his absence, but
also that those who- tf ere on the
scene,, and speak from personal
knowledge and the, records, have
wilfully misstated the facts. -At
the same time in another portion of
his paper, the Sutter Creek editor
publishes a statement, intended as
an exoneration' of the judge's ab
sence, which read between the lines
and in the light of law, is- a confes
sion of negligence. ; Will our cotem
porary explain why Judge Rust in
1900 absented himself during the
closing days of naturalization in a
presidential year, and in 1902 in a
state and county election, and when
he himself was about to appeal to
the voters for indorsement at the
polls, remained at his post of duty
to naturalize those entitled to nat
uralization. A vacation at the re
quest of the bar association was ■on
duriug both periods. Why the dis
tinction.' ' The reason is obvious.
Our cotemporary is not talking
about what he knows, but what he
does not know. No doubt he has
reason for his conduct.
111 the triangular battle for super
visor in the fifth district, Fred Le-
Mom, the present republican incum
bent, who has made a creditable
record, is straining every nerve to
win out. He ought to win. Tho
people of that district cannot afford
to turn him down/ It would be in
terpreted as a refusal to recogn ize
fidelity in office by a re-election for
a second term even.
That Jack Marchant will be the
next assessor to succeed himself is a :
foregone conclusion. He is the only
man in that office withiu our recol
lection who has made a systematic
and general effort to equalize assess
ments, and hunt up property that
had escaped taxation in order to put
it on the list. So well has he suc
ceeded, and so generally are the tax-,
payers satisfied with his work, that
not a single application was made
this year for reduction or increase
of assessments. He ought to be re
elected by a larger majoi-ity than he
had four years ago.
S. "G. Spagnoli has made a de
servedly popular treasurer. ' No
better man" for that office cau be
found within the limits of the coun
ty. -We are aware that his opponent
is also a popular man. . Let republi
cans stand by their nominee for
treasurer. He deserves their sup
port.

BEWARE OF POLITICIANS.
It is current talk on the streets of
Jackson that efforts are being made
in the interest of certain candidates
for re-election to secure the support
of the newly organized miners' union
iv this couuty. Such a course can
only be construed as a dernier re
sort in the face of impending defeat.
The union men, whatever be their
numbers, will display- their good
sense in' refusing to be drawn into
any such snare in behalf of any
candidate. In view of the history
of tho past, it becomes them to keep
clear of politicians. It was the fact
that,- office-seekers arlfl politicians
held sway jin • the organization of
thirty years ago, that led to the
terrible scenes that were enacted in
those days. The memories of that
period of "strife and industrial panic
are still fresh in the minds of many
now living, and the causes which set
tho country back for a decade are
well known. As an abstract propo
sition — the right of miners or any
other class of workmen, to organize
for mutual benefit can be questioned.
But when the support of such unions
is sought for political ends, with im
plied promise of return support if
elected, the matter at once assumes
a serious phase, and the foundation
for trouble is laid. By all means
keep out of politics. Bar from your
order any man who would lead you
iv that direction. He is not a friend,
but an enemy. If the politician
gomes around, coquetting for your
aid, shuu him, and vote against him.
He seeks you out only to make use
of you for his own political prefer
ment. His touch means not life,
but death. His honeyed words are
not nourishment, but poison. More
over, iv the condition of affairs now
existing in Amador county, persons
seeking to form an alliance with the
infant organization, for his own
political aggrandisement, should, be
taboved at the ballot-box not only
by tho union men themselves, but
uon-uuiou men also, and by the mine
owners and employers " generally.
He ought to be beaten badly, as an
example that such tactics will not
be tolerated under present conditions
in Amador couuty.
THE ELDER SOTHERN.
* Couple of the Celebrated Come
dlan'a Practical Jokes.
Many stories are told of Sothern's
original methods of entertaining his
friends at dinner, and possibly the
most amusing.- is that of the belated
guest \ When, late In the dinner, this
friend waiTMnounced, Mr. Sothern ex
claimed, "Lqt us nil hide^ under the
table," and down they all went save
Mr. Sothern himself, who remained
seated. When the tardy guest entered,
Mr. Sothern rose and received him
with exquisite courtesy, saying, "When
your name was announced, my guests,
for some unaccountable reason, all hid
under the table." After a few mo
ments of discomfort one. by one they
crept out and back to their seats.
I heard from both Mr. Sothern and
Mrs. Vincent this account of an out
burst of fun at a dinner given by him
la his parlor at the Revere House: As
the guests, ten in number, were gath
ered about the open fire before dinner
a stout, pompous waiter, afflicted with
short breath, added the last touches to
his dinner table, already spread. Ten
large, square pieces of bread were
placed with mathematical precision
pne at each plate, and then he left the
room to bring the wine. Mr. Sothern
saw his opportunity and, calling his
dog>cried: "Tiger, the bread! Quick,
Tiger!" And the nimble little gray
hound bounded lightly upon the table
again and again as he heard his mas
ter's imperative "Fetch the bread!' 1
until each piece had been removed to
a dark corner near the fire.
Upon the waiter's return all was si
lence. The expectant look upon" Mr.
Sothern's face showed only that dinner
waa awaited. Standing for a moment,
bewildered, the waiter, seeing no bread
upon the table, hesitatingly turned to
the door, then retraced his 'steps to
the table, examined It carefully and
hurriedly left the room. He soon re
appeared with a fresh plate of bread,
and again at each plate a piece was
carefully placed, and he "retired with
the empty plate. "Quick, Tiger! Fetch
It again I More bread! More bread!"
And once more each piece was re
moved before the grave waiter vreap
peared, and all were again silent. 'One
look at the table and one at the
guests, and there remained no doubt.
Those po.or, hungry actors had eaten
it! With a look of contempt he an
nounced dinner, and after all were
safely seated at the table he brought
a third plate of bread and with a fork
placed It, with a gesture of scorn,
piece by piece for. each person and for
the hosf. The merry scene soon dis
armed his hostility, and before the
evening was over the bread In the cor
ner was revealed.— Mrs. Lucy. Derby

A friend has kindly furnished the

peech made by Hon. L. It. Tulloch at

ocal papers said, he devoted consider
ible time to editor Webb of Jackson.
We find that this distinguished heavy
veight orator,- whose speech is such a
lopeless muddle of words, that we are
inable to find therein a single idea in
diligently and concisely expressed, has
bold the Placorville folks tho same old
frayed out stuff he got off ten years
igo in Jackson, about editor Webb.
He told his hearers in that campaign,
as he is telling them now, that his
ancestors built the Pyramids of Egypt,
when Webb's ancestors were clinging
to trees by their tails. It is comforting
to know that we belong to a race that
Ls on the lino of progress. We beg to
remind this eminent philologist that
he is "clinging" to tho saino old tune
he sang ten years ago. We have
placed his speech in our gallery of art
as a literary curiosity.

it is gone into the better it will be fyr

Rainfall.
The first rain of the season com
menced Tuesday afternoon. Not for
many years has iho starting in of the
rainy season been delayed so long.
Except a slight sprinkle in August —
not enough to measure— we have had
not a drop of rain for the season until
this week. Our weather records do
not show a parallel to such a late com
mencement of winter, although in the
season 189S-9 there was less rain up to
November 1 than we have had this
week. The rainfall has been sufficient
ly heavy not only to lay the dust, but
to start the grass. It will no doubt
start the streams in the eastern part of
the county which help to feed the Blue
Lakes canal, and thereby stave off all
fears of a scarcity of water this season.
The rainfall for the week as measured
by the Ledger gauge is as follows:
Oct. 21.. 0.98

AN ASTOUNDIN6 STATEMENT.
Details of a Border Crime Never Before Pub
lished—A Remarkable Instance of
the Flead-Guilty Business. /
On the 11th instant we received a let
from A. Maron, post-marked El Dor
ado, conveying the startling- informa
tion that a crime, the scene of which
was alleged to have been laid in El
Dorado county, was taken in hand by
the officials in Ainador county, atid the
perpetrator sent to the penitentiary on
a plea of guiliy. 'FBe article was in
tended for publication in the interest
of good government, with full ivrmis
sion to append the author's name there
to. The case was entirely now to us,
and while realizing- at a glanco' the
gravity and importance, of the com
munication, the facts were so moagerly
stated that wo decided to await fur
ther particulars. Accordingly, wo no
tified our corespondent— who is a por
fect stranger to us— to that effect. In
the meantime we made inquiries of par
ties from the mountains who were ac
quainted with the neighborhood of
the crime — which -vas said to bo about
three miles froraWiley's station, where
the boundary line between the two
counties is unmistakably marked by
the Ainador wasron road. The infor
mation thus gained socmod to tally.
with the main facts in our correspon
dent's letter. In a few days wo received
the following reply to our request for
further particulars:
El Dorado, Cal., Oct. 20, 1902.
A mad or Ledger: — Yours of the 17th
ult., is at hand, and hasten to answer.
I give you herewith all I deem nec
essary in the cattle-stealing case of
Lester,
On the 1 18 th of September, .1900, in
the evening, a shot from a ritle was
fired in a westerly direction from where
I then lived, on a homestead claim
situated on Clear creek, better known
as the south fork of the middle fork of i
Cosumnes river, about 2A miles north I
of the Amador county line, in El Do
rado county, on what is known as tho
Bridget Barney place, owned by James
L. Barnoy.
On the morning of the 19th of Sept.
I left my place to find the cause of a
calf bellowing all the night befo'ro. As
I neared the Barney place I saw W. H.
Lester walking toward his home with
a load of something in a sack on his
shoulder. I measured his track, aud I
found it tallied exactly with the tneas
urments ■ I had taken before. ' The
smell of blood attracted my dog's at
tention, and I followed him to the spot
where a beef had been cut vp — hide
and hair and beef. I found the same
tracks there again; ' the heaviest track
or trail led into J. L. Barney's barn.
The door — or at least where the door
had once been — had been heavily bar
ricaded previous to the butchering,
but on the morning in question there
were only a few- boards in tho place,
and a few sacks .hung over thorn. My
dogs entered the barn, and I came to
the conclusion it was safe for me to
look in. On looking in I saw what
looked like a front quarter of a beef
lying on one of the mangers. I left
the Barnoy promises after I had noted
the scene of tho butchering, and started
for the Lester place, about a .', of a mile
distant, in a north-westerly direction.
When I reached his place I found him
coming from the spring with a pall of
water, with which I saw him after
wards trying to cloan tallow that was
all soiled with dirt and blood. T-le
told me he bought a front quarter of
beef from the Pleasant Valley butcher,
and that ho bought the tallow in ques
tion: but no butcher would sell tallow
in such condition. I know that I had
one of the parties who butchered a cow
belonging to Allen, or the estate of
George Allen. n
As I had seen all 1 needed, I pre
pared to find the herder of Allen, to
find out from him what to do. I did
not get to speak to him until the after
noon of September 19, 1900. After I
told him (George Joses) all I knew of
the case, we wont together to J. L.
Barney's barn and found some of the
beef hid away in the mangers of the
barn, covered over with hay taken
from the barn. Joses left me in charge
of the barn and beef, while he rode to
Sutter Creek to see the boss. That
party was gone, so he told me after
wards. I cannot tell who gave orders
to Sheriff Gregory to arrest Lester,
but on the next day, the 20th of Sept.,
Gregory arrested W. H. Lester for
cattle stealing in El Dorado county, in
the presence of myself, G. Joses, and
another cattleman, and took him to
Jackson, and landed him in jail there.
I claim that Gregory took the law. in
his own bands when be kept Lester
there, to get him to plead guilty. It
was Gregory's duty to notify the of
ficers of Et Dorado county-to come and
get the prisoner. Instead of that,
Lester was shipped to San Quentin
from Amador county.
Gregory appointed me keeper of Les
ter's place. 1 was thereby tied hand and
foot. A few days after Lester's arrest I
sent a letter to Gregory, telling him of
the finding of some more beef and hides
in the possession of Lester, as well as
some corn beef undoubtedly killed the
summer before. I told him in the letter
that it would be wrong to have Lester
plead guilty, as that would allow his
partner to escape unpunished. I am
satisfied that Gregory got my letter ero
he shipped Lester to the penitentiary.
Letters which Lester sent from the
Jackson jail tended to prove that ho
was urged to plead guilty, for what pur
pose others are hotter able to answer
than I am. It is no hard matter to
prove that at least one other person
not far from'the scene of the crime was
anxious to prevent Lester from stand
ing trial, as he was afraid of exposure
It seems to me this is enough, \yill
also give witnesses in the case if need
be. ..-. .....
Very respecifullv, '
A. Marox.
Upon this showing the case became
sufficiently interesting to lead us to
pursue it further. \Ve decided to look
up the records. The register of actions |
shows that an information was filed
against W. H. Lester on September
25, and arraignment same day. This
is all. The superior court minutes
show that on his arraignment defend
ant declined to have an attorney; that
he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to
two years in San Quentin. It does not
appear that any testimony was taken
either to show the grade of the crime
or to prove jurisdiction. We next ex
amined the judgment roll, and found
that the only witness indorsed on the
information or complaint as having ap
peared before the committing magis
trate was "U S Gregory." That the
crime charged was cattle stealing com
mitted on the 18th of September; 1900,
in Amador county. We thereupon
wanted to see the testimony upon
which the accused was held for trial in
Amador county, but in this we were
disappointed. The deposition in this
"sole witness" case was not on file.
The examination was held before Jus
tice Goldner of Jackson. Upon exami
nation of the justice's docket, we found
'that the rrniplaint— the substance of
j which, is siH out in the docket— was
i sworn to on the 24th of -September by
i U S -Gregory. It charp» positively
' and directly that W. H. Lester, of the ;
j county of El Dorado, oti the 18tli day
' of'Srtptoniber, 1900, at Shake Ridge, in ;
I tho.couoty of Amador, state of Cali- j
i forula, committed the crime of felony,
|to wit, grand larceny. The said Wil
j Ham H. Lester, at the time and place '
I aforesaid, feloniously, did- kill, sleal,^
I take and carry away from the moun- j
i tain cattle range of the estate of George I
; Allen, deceased. . otic ; iiiw, tho
; beinc theu and thorp th» property of,
! the estate of Gro. Alleu, deceased] ' i
i Tho defendant was asked whether he
i wautud an attorin'.v. and 'replied thai
jho did not. ; Tho taking ilown of the
testimony in short luiuil, whi«;h .is
j usually dono iv f- toiiy cases which <ro
; i.> trial, was waivud, aud this is tho ex
planation of there being no deposition
on tile. The law says that' with the
consent of all parties— the district at
torney, defendant, and court — reducing
of the testimony to writing may ' be
waived. So it was satisfactory all
round that the testimony in this case
should not be perpetuated. The ex
amination was hold on the 25th— tho
same, day that the matter canto up in
tho superior court. U S Gregory was
the-, sole witness. The. law* provides
that' 'a preliminary r examination in
felony cases' cannot bo waived.
These aYe the facts from the records.
It is needless to comment upon them.
No doubt the man killed the. cow. But
if tho statement of our correspondent
is correct — and he gives the only cir
cumstantial account of the matter that
has appeared in writing— the crime be
longed to El Dorado county, to look
after. This case is a signal illustration
of the dangerous tendency of the"* 'plead
guilty" policy which has grown tto be
such a prominent feature of the courts
of "Amador county. '

The Worst Form.
Multitudes are singing the praises of
Kodol, the new discovery which is
making sp many sick people well and
weak people strong by diffesting what
they eat, by cleansing and" sweetening
tho stomach and by transforming their
food into the. kind of pure, rich, red
blood that makes you feel good all
over. Mrs, Cranfill, of Troy, I. T.,
writes: Jp6r a number of years I was
troubled with indigestion and dyspep
sia which grew into the worst form.
Finally I was induced to use Kodol and
after using four bottles I am entirely
cured. I heartily recommend Kodol
to all sufferers from indigestion and
dyspepsia. . Take a dose after meals.
It digests what you eat. Kerr's Phar
macy, Jackson.[MISCELLANEOUS ADVERTISEMENTS.

love because Lincoln poured out his blood
for It; no one but must feel his devotion
for his country renewed and kindled when
he remembers how McKinley loved, re
vered and served It, showed In his life
how a citizen should live and In his last
hour taught us how a gentleman could
die. .
Blame's oration on Garneld ended
with this famous passage:
As the end drew near ,hls early craving
for the sea returned. The stately man-
Bion of power had been to him the weari
some hospital of pain, and he begged to
be taken from his prison walls, from Its
oppressive, stifling air, from Its home
lessness and Its hopelessness. Gently, si
lently, the love of a great people bore the
pale sufferer to the longed for healing of
the sea to live or to die, as God should
will, within sight of the heaving billows,
within sound of Its manifold voices. With
a wan, fevered face, tenderly lifted -to
the cooling breeze, he looked out wistful
ly upon the ocean's changing wonders, on
Its far sails, on Its restless waves rolling
shoreward to break and* die beneath the
noonday sun; on the red olouds of even
ing, arching low to the horizon; on the
serene and shining pathway of the stars.
Let us think that his dying eyes read a
mystic meaning which only the rapt and
parting soul may know. Let us believe
that in the silence of the' receding world
he heard the great waves breaking on a
farther shore and felt already upon his
wasted brow the breath of the eternal
morning.
THE PARADISE FISH.
One o( the Wonderful Piscatorial
Rarities Found In China.
The oddest of all piscatorial rarities
is the paradise fish of China. Like the
German canary and one or two other
species of bird and fish, this little finny
beauty is the product of cultivation
only, there being no place In the world
where it is found in a wild state. In
the land of the dragon they are kept
and cultivated in 'ornamental aquari
ums, each succeeding generation of the
little oddities exhibiting more diver
sified colors. The male is the larger of
the two sexes, measuring when full
grown three and a half Inches. The
body is shaped very much like that of
a common pumpkin seed sunfish, its
color surpassing in brilliancy any flsh
heretofore cultivated for the aquarium.
The head of macropodus (that's his
generic name) is ashy gray, mottled
with Irregular dark spots. The gills
are azxirine blue, bordered with bril
liant crimson.
The eyes are yellow and red, with a
black pupil. The sides of the body and
the crescent shaped caudal fln are deep
crimson, the former having from ten
to twelve vertical blue stripes, while
the latter is bordered with blue. The
upper surface of the body is continual
ly changing color — sometimes "it Is
white, at others gray, black or blue.
The dorsal and anal fins are remarka
bly large, hence Its generic name—
macro, large; podus, fin or foot. Both
fins are shaped alike and are striped
with brown aud bordered with a bright
blue. The dull colored ventral fins are
protected by a brilliant scarlet colored
spine, extending three-fourths of an
inch behind the body of the fln. The
pectoral fins are well shaped, but trans
parent and colorless.
Mounting: a Horse.
. A careful bicyclist learns to mount
from either side of the wheel, since the
emergency may arise at any moment,
says the London Chronicle. Ope would
think that the horseman would be
equally careful to provide for possibil
ities and accustom himself to mount
ing indifferently from the off side and
the near side. But if he were to ven
ture to mount on the right side— which
is the wrong side — in a hotel stable
yard the hostler would probably de
mand -the. price of a gallon as the
statutory fine, and the horse would col
lapse with surprise. What Is the
meaning of this convention? It ap
pears in odd places. Not only doea
the trick horse, in the circus canter
from right to left, but the after dinner
wine passes the same way. "The way
of the sun" is the current explanation,
which is absurd.
