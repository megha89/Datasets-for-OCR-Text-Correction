A BORN LAWYER.
A lawyer advertised for a clerk.
The Dext' morning his office was
crowded with applicants, all bright,
and many suitable. He bade them
wait until all should arrive, and then
ranged them in a row, and said he
would tell them a story/ note their
comments, and judge from whom he
wouid chose.
"A certain fanner," began the
lawyer, "was troubled with ; a red
squirrel, that got. in through" a hole
in bis barn, and stoic his seed corn.
He resolved to kill the squirrel at
the first opportunity. Seeing him
go in at the hole one noon, j he took
his shotgun aud fired away. The
first shot set the barn on fire."
"Did the barn burn?" said one of
tho boys.
"The lawyer, without answer,
continued: "And, seeing the baru
on fire, the farmer seized a pail of
water, and ran to put it out."
"Did he put it out?" said another.
"As be passed inside, the door
shut to, and the barn was soon in
flames. When the hired girl rushed
out with more water"'
"Did they all burn up?" said an
other'boy. >".
"The lawyer weut on without ans
wer:
"Then the lady came out, aud all
was noise and confusion, ; and every
body was trying to put out the fire."
"Did auyouc burn up?" said an
other.
The lawyer said: "There, thatwilf
do; you have all shown your interest
in the story." But, observing one
little bright-eyed fellow in deep
silence, he said: ''Now, my little
mau, what have you to say?"
The little fellow blushed, grew un
easy, and stammered out: "I want,
to know what became of that squir
rel: that's what I want to know."
"You'll do," said the lawyer;
"you are my man. You have not
been switched off by a confusion,
and a barn burning, and the hired
girls, and water-pails; you h^ve
kept your eye on the squirrel."'

Children's
Fertilizer v
That's a good, name for
Scott's Emulsion. Children
are like young plants. Some
will grow in ordinary soil.
Others need fertilizers.
The nature of some children
prevents them from thriving
on ordinary food Such chil-
dren grow right if treated right.
All they need is a little fer-
tilizer — a little extra richness.
Scott's Emulsion is the right
treatment
Fertilizers make things grow.
That's just what Scott's Emul-
sion does. It makes children
grow in flesh, grow in strength,
grow rich blood, grow in mind,
grow happy. That's what we
make it for. • r-~-..r -~-..

MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION.
A Case of Well ' Derelope* tlerrm.
Coupled Wit* -Wit.
•There is absolute wit In some men's
nerve," Bald a 'business man to a re
porter. "My partner and. l, with the
intention of expanding ' our business,
about a year ago decided to send a rep
resentative through the south. We
looked I over the field carefully and
finally picked out a young man who
was possessed of good' address and
who, we felt sure, would do the work. '
. "He : Bad been convivial In former
days, but his deportment bad I been
such for a year that It made us feel
confident he would do the proper thing.
He was given $400 for. expenses and
was started out on the mission. It was
the understanding that he was to make
11 daily report of his efforts. . V/ '■"■
"Two months passed by, and we-nev
tr heard from -him. We telegraphed
repeatedly to different towns that were
on his Itinerary, but not a word could
be learned regarding his whereabouts.
Finally one day a hurried telegram,
collect, came. It read:
-".'lnmnot selling many goods, but
am making a fine Impression. Wire
$100 quick.'
"The nerve of the fellow got our
nerve, and, do you know, we wired him
the $100, and afterward be made good.
We have never asked him what he "did
during the two months, and be has
never broached the subject to us. -It
was the wit that pleased us."—Wash

Nature's 'Wonders.
The common flea leaps 200 times its
own length. To show, like agility a
man six feet tall would have to leap a
distance of 1,200 feet The cheese
mite is about one-quarter of an inch
in length, yet it has been seen to take
the tip of Its tail in Its mouth and
then, letting go with a jerk, to leap out
of a vessel six Inches in depth. To
equal this a man would have to jump
out of a well from a depth of 144 feet.
And equally strange things are found
among the plants and vegetables. A
well known student of nature once
tried the growing force of a squash.
When It was eighteen days old and
measured twenty-seven inches In cir
cumference, be fixed a sort of harness
around it, with a long lever attached.
The power of the squash was measur
ed by the weight It lifted, tho weight
being fixed to the lever. When It was
twenty days old, two days after the
harness was fixed on it, It lifted sixty
pounds. On the nineteenth day It lift
ed 5,000 pounds.
Mnch Ado Altnnt an "S."
The printing of the Bible Is the most
strictly guarded work in existence,- a
fact which appears strange until we
reflect on the mischief an inaccurate
Bible might bring about. The king's
printers and the two universities of
Oxford and Cambridge give to the
world all the Bibles printed . in the
United Kingdom except some printed
by special license. A few years ago
the question arose whether the word
"spirit" in Matthew iv, 1, and Mark 1,
12, should have a capital "S," it having
been previously printed with a small
one, and, although the word was obvi
ously wrongly printed^it was not until
after the ruling powers at the universi
ties aud the king's printers had met in
solemn council that leave was given to
use the capital letter.
Nothing sanctioned by authority In
1011 'may be changed without creating
something akin to revolution in the
places where Bibles are printed.—Liv
erpool Post •".■■■
Verdi and HU Admirer.
Verdi was once traveling in the samp
railway carriage with General Tour
non, : commander of the Ravenna dis
trict. They '.got Into conversation,
which soon turned on the subject of
music, and the general, who did not
know his companion, expressed a most
enthusiastic preference for that of It
aly. "I can hardly go so far with you,"
replied the other. "For me, art has no
frontiers, and I give German music
the preference over Italian."
"Indeed, sir," said the general testi
ly. "For my part, I would give all the
German operas In the world for one
net of 'RlgolettQ.' "
"You really must excuse me from
following you any j further on this
ground," replied the composer, blush
ing a little. "I am Verdi."
The Chief Sense.
All the great families of living things
have a dominant sense. We load our
life by. sight and make nrtiiioi.il lights
to render darkness tolerable. But the
creature whom next to ourselves we
prefer, the dog, lives in a very different
universe. His dominant sense, like that
of many other quadrupeds, is the very
one we most neglect, the sense of smell.
The dog will (pack his master, never
lifting up his head to search the dis
tance; often with hair falling bver his
eyes he follows on, not troubling him
self to shake It aside.
Goldfish.
It may not be generally known that
there is cruelty in the keeping of gold

How Messenger Boys Are Utilised pa
Awak«nen In New York. >..
At 1 o'clock the other morning a well
dressed man strolled into one of tho
uptown messenger offices. lie had been
dining out and evidently, from the rak
ish tilt to his opera hat, the dinner had
been a success. ..;" :
"I want a messenger boy to come and"
waken me in the morning."
"What hour?" ; The clerk ; was all
business, for the request was not un
usual. | . ; >
"Seven o'clock. I've got to catch a
train," he explained.
"All right, sir; 7 o'clock," assured the
clerk. . . ,
The man turned as he was going out
of the door. "Have the boy hammer
tho door hard," he cautioned. "I'm a
'dead one' when I get to sleep, and I've
got to catch that train." Then he went
home and went to sleep with absolute
confidence.' .;V ;
The whistles were blowing 7 o'clock.
A small boy in uniform hammered
with , a club, t his "wakener," on the
door of the man who had dined the
night before. •' "Get up in therel" he
cried. "Get up, you old sleepyhead!"
"You go away from my door." comes
in sleepy tones from the room. "It's a
mistake. I 'don't want to get up."
"Oh, yes, you do, my dodo bird," Is
the fresh reply. And the tattoo on the
door goes on with redoubled strength.
"All right, boy; I'm awake nowH
howls the man who has been sleeping.
"You can go away now."
. "Not till you've signed . this receipt"
the boy insists. «
The man has to crawl out of bed and
come to the door. I The boy has a paper
ready, and as. he Is a careful man t he
reads before signing. It certifies that
he has been thoroughly wakened by
Messenger No. 432 and that he is not
going bock'to bed again that day.
"Is this a Joker he asks the boy. V'
"Naw, Hain't no Joke," replied the
messenger through his teeth. "If we'se
didn't make you'se do this, you'd be
down to de office about noon j^-howlln'
dat we didn't wake you'se. Now/lf

COOKING FISH IN ENGLAND.
The Method Used There Renders the
Flesh Flakr and Juicy.
John Bull certainly knows how to
cook, fish, to prove which fact one has
only to notice the Juiciness and good
flavor of the first bit of fish, served
perhaps at a little out of the way Inn,
that one tastes In England. We Amer
icans have at command many fine va
rieties of fish, but too "often find It sent
to table in a "woolly," tasteless condi
tion. 7 •
An American cousin visiting in an
English family made bold to ask what
method of cooking "sea food" was
prevalent In England and found that
there the Importance of the thorough
cooking of fish as a safeguard against
ptomaines Is as much regarded as with
us. Our old country friends, however,
assure us that there is not the slight
est occasion to render flsh dry and
tasteless In order to insure thorough
cooking if proper attention is given to
basting. One cannot well imagine any
thing hotter than boiling fat, and lav
ing plentifully with this Is to make use
of the surest ammunition possible for
the routing of deadly bacteria.
Instead of warning amateurs against
underdone flsh, let copious basting with
sweet boiling fat be Insisted on, and in
place of a woolly, flavorless result
there will be the opposite— fiakincsa
and Juiciness. Overboiling will pro
duce woolliness as surely as overfrying
or bating. To insure tender, solid
flakes in, for instance, boiled cod or
halibut and- to avoid dissipating the
flavor make sure the water boils when
the fish Is put in; keep at a gentle
boil; allow only ten minutes to the
pound and tie carefully in cheesecloth
that has been washed and boiled be
fore using. Cod well ba"sted with hof
olive oil or any good fat will be almost
gamy to flavor, as will cod steaks
cooked in deep fat— Washington Star.

SPRINKLING SINGAPORE.
The Solemn Procenslon That Accom-
panics the Watering Cart.
Poultney Blgelow In his description
of the marvelous progress made by the
city of Singapore under English 'rule
gave a quaint picture of the manner In
which the streets are watered:
The watering cart was drawn by lit
tle white bullocks and driven by Ma
lays with turbans. " It seemed to take
five Malays to do this driving." One
roosted aloft on tup of the barrel for
the purpose of controlling the outgo of
water. He seemed very proud of his
appointment Another native In a big
turban roosted on the pole and con
trolled the little cattle.
Then there was n man In thin brown
legs and much turban who walked sol
emnly behlud enjoying a footbath. He
was obviously a government function
ary, although his exact sphere of use-,
fulness I could not discover. He ap
peared to be something In the nature
of a rear guard.
Then there was a "foreloper," or ad
vance guard, for the purpose of clear-
Ing the way. There appeared to be an
Idea that the little bullocks might sud
denly go mad and rush ahead. At any
rate, it gave congenial employment to
one more native, and that was some
thing. /
These was yet another, who bent
down now and then to pick up a plecft
of stone or brush away some Irregular
ity unseen by ordinary eyes.
This outfit was a treat to me. It was
solemn; it was full of self conscious
ness; It was magnificently oriental.
I have seen men In sublime moments;
I have seen the red capped station mas
ter of Germany strut up and down his
platform when on Imperial train was
about to arrive, but even that impress
ed me less than the watering cart of
Singnporp. with its municipal hierarchy
of Malay ministers, each earning per
haps 2 cents a day.
Doves and Coronation!.
At the ancient ceremonies of corona
tion of the French kings, after the
anointing had been performed, some
white doves were let 'loose In the
church. This was supposed to symbol
ize the power of the Holy GhostMn di
recting the king's actions. A similar
Idea seems to have inspired all early
kings, for among the English regalia
is the rod of equity or the scepter with
the dove. This Is simply a golden rod
with a mound at the top, which sup
ports a cross. On this cross Is a dove,
fashioned of white enamel, with ex
panded wings. Some fine diamonds
ornament the rod In various placet.
No Exctme This Time.
"It was a new gun, your honor," pro
tested the prisoner* "and I did not
kuow it was loaded."
"But," argued the Judge, "the dealer
has Just told us that you did not pay
for the weapon."
"What has that to do with It?"
"Well, if you didn't pay for it the
dealer must have charged it for you."
And the Judge tried to look as much
like the pictures of Solomon as he
could.— Baltimore American.

DIAMOND BACK TERRAPIN.
Formerly Despised, : They Are Wow
Considered a Delicacy.
. naif a century or so ago diamond
back terrapin were fed to slaves an 4
hogs. Today they are the rarest deli
cacy known to the epicurlan world,
says the Philadelphia North American.
Then they sold for ?1 a barrel, %nd
iaborern, .when hiring out, specified
that they must not be compelled to eat
terrapin more than twice a week. To
day a barrel is cheap at $800, and mil
lionaires travel hundreds of milea for
a chance to feast on this most deli
cious of all meats.
Of course thiß means genuine dia
mond backs. There are many Imita
tions. . i^.*. ; . :r: r
Every first class restaurant . In the
country features "terrapin a la Mary
land" on its menu, "but in not one case
out of a hundred is the real terrapin
served. The diner regales himself on
what he believes to" be Maryland's
choicest dish. Instead he is merely
eating fresh water turtles, "sliders" or
"North Carolina goldens."
-The reason la simple. Restaurateurs
don't serve real diamond backs fce
cause they can't get them. The world's
total terrapin population does not ex
ceed 25,000 of legal size, and these ate
confined to the shores of the Chesa
peake bay, -the only place that produces
them.
Baltimore, Philadelphia and New
York enjoy a monopoly." These three
cities get practically the entire output,
but few ever find their way across the
Blue Ridge. The epicure unfortunate
enough to be born iv Chicago or St
Louis must either come east or forego
the Joys of terrapin.
To select a real diamond back ama
teurs should be guided by these dlstta
guishlng and characteristic markings:
It is of a greenish, dark olive crjor,
sometimes running .to spotted gray,
yellow on the plate which surrounds
the shell and has concentric dark
stripes along the plate on both shells.
The sides of the head are a dirty whtye,
sprinkled with small black spots. Thd
bottom shell Is of whitish yellow.

THE MEXICAN EDITOR
It Is Veiy Easy For Htm to Get Into
Serious Trouble.
The newspaper laws of Mexico are
very stringent. If any person I*B men
tioned in a newspaper article and feeto
offended about it, he can easily send
the ediWr of the paper and the writer
of the article to prison. The state
ments may Ij^ve been far within tQ9
limits of truth and Justice, but that
makes no difference. The editor In
communicado has a chance to think
about the law, and the aggrieved per
son smiled pleasantly. After awhile
the law gets in its work, the case is In
vestigated, and the editor is punished,
for even the truth Is libelous, and libel
Is one of the offenses most severely
condemned.
According to the theory of the Mexi
can law, every person has a right to go
about entirely free from annoyance by
other persons. If the person violates
the law, the newspaper has no right to
say so. It can lay Information before
the courts if It wants to, but It must
not say in its columns that it has done
so. Then the law will step in and take
charge of the offender, but the repre
sentatives of the paper will not be al
lowed to attend the trial, and only the
bare result, after weeks, of waiting,
can be told to the public.
If the offense charged against the ed
itor is regarded by the first magistrate
to whom the complaint is made as be
ing especially grave, the paper is gen
erally suppressed. The complaint has
been received and passed upon. Then
a squad of police descends upon the
printing office. Sometimes all the em
ployees . are arrested, sometimes only
the editor. Then the r doors of the
building are closed, official seals are
placed upon them, and a guard is sta
tioned to see that no one tries to en
ter. For three days the editor can do
.nothing. The laws under which he Is
arrested are modeled after those of the
code Napoleon, and for three daya he
Is held incommunicado, while the au
thorities hunt up evidence. Then he
is given" a hearing, j In the meantime
his paper has been suppressed, and In
many cases it never comes to life again,
even though the editor may eventually
clear himself of all blame.— Plttsburg

PETROLEUM.
Probable Life of the v Prodnct Discussed.
Human foresight is at best only 7a
very imperfect vision and sees er
rors quite as often as it sees truth.
Twenty years ago the then experts
in petroleum predicted that the end
of, the production in the United
States on a large scale was io sight.
Now they are confronted not only
with a steady yield of oil much
greater than any known at the time
when they | so confidently asserted
that the oil fields were pretty well
exhausted, but they have to face 'an
expansion in the petroleum output
of the United i States which is al
together beyond precedent. Recent
additions to the former capacity of
the oil regions are far' greater than
the entire flow of the Pennsylvania
fields in their best estate.
The rapid increase is not confined
to the wonderful new fields in Texas.
The Indiana petroleum region is the
scene of much work in the way of de- J
velopment, and there are many new
wells- of good capacity. - . Even in
Pennsylvania the supply of petrole
um holds out far better than it
seemed likely to many years ' ago.
Nor is any expert in petroleum as
sure now that the limit of discovery
has been reached as many authori
ties were before great deposits of
oil had been fouud in Western Ohio,
Indiana, California arrd Texas.
There are still some, however, who
predict now, as formerly, that the
exhaustion of coal and petroleum de
posits is sure to result from the <
present prodigal waste of - those
natural stores. They say that, how
ever prodigal nature may have been
in bestowing such wealth upon the
American people, and impossible -
though it is to set limits to the de
velopments of the near future in
such directions as is evideut that in
the long run the progress of the
human race toward ideal fuel, light
and power must be in other direc
tions.- The v coal will be' exhausted
in time, and the petroleum far
sooner. Experiencehas taught that
natural gas can be depended upon
only a few decades, at best, in any
locality. The stores of distant ages,
accumulated ' through vast cycles, :
are used up in a few years or cen
turies. \
Such sorrowing souls should quiet
their fears. Long before the cen
turies roll around to the time when
the coal beds and petroleum de
posits shall have become exhausted
science will have perfecred other
methods of providing heat and light,
and the present prophets of evil "will
have been sleeping the long sleep
for hundreds of years.— Plant, Oil

OLD IDEAS ABOUT GEMS.
Pearls Were Thought to Be ' Dew-
drops Caught by the Shell.
The Indians called rock crystal an
"unripe diamond," and until the begin
ning of the eighteenth century India
was thought to be the only land which
produced that precious stone. It wais
not, therefore, until the discovery ot
India that the diamond was known to
us. Yet as far back as 500 B. C. a
"didactic history" of precious stones
was written, and in Pliny's time the
supply must have been plentiful, as he
wrote, "We drink out of a mass of
gems, and our drinking vessels ay?
formed of emeralds." We are also tojd
that Nero aided his weak sight by,
spectacles made of emeralds.
But Is very difficult to determine
whence all the gems cftnie, as discov
erers took care to leave no record. The
nations who traded in them were
afraid of their whereabouts being
known, and even the most ancient mer
chants would not disclose any definite
locale. All sorts of myths have ac
cordingly sprung up concerning the
origin of gems. "Diamond", was tha
name given to a youth who was turned
into the hardest and most brilliant of
substances to preserve him from "tliQ
ills that flesh is heir to." Amethyst
was a beautiful nymph beloved bT
Bacchus, but saved from him by Itt
ana, who changed Amethyst into a
gem, whereupon Bacchus turned Ule
gem into wine color and endowed u&
wearer with the gift of preservation
from Intoxication.
.The pearl was thought to be a dew.
drop the shell had opened to receive.
Amber was said to be honey melted by
the sun, dropped into the sea and con
gealed. According to the Talmud, Noah
had no light in the ark but that which
came from precious stones.—Gentle

GET REGISTERED.
The question of registration is a
serious one. Its importance in the
coming campaign dwarfs all other
matters. The apathy in this regard
is phenominal. Not only in Ama
dor county, but throughout the
state this indifference is noticed, and
is the subject of discussion by politi
" cal bodies. The all-important con-
sideration in Amador for republi-
cans is to jret tho. voters of that
party in the voting line. We have
no fear of the result at the polls pro
viding republicans do not lose any
greater percentage of votes by
reason of non -registration than the
democrats. Republicans not only
have the numerical strength to
break up the ruling clique that has
held sway for these many years, but
there is the disposition to do so, and
this tendency is not confined to the
republican party. There ought to
be ample opportunity afforded .by
the officers concerned to get citizens
registered with the least possible in
convenience. It does not look well
to show the partisan spirit too plain
ly in this matter. We observe that
the notice in regard to re-registration
is being published in one solitary
democratic paper, and in lone. In
that advertisement it is noticeable
that the deputies for registration
purposes are composed exclusively of
members of the democratic party.
It is also noticeable that such im
portant towns as Amador City and
Plymouth have no resident deputy
authorized to register voters. This
is entirely out of joint with the
practice in other counties. In
Contra Costa county for instance,
towns like Crockett and Antioch are
given three and four deputies, and
it is not to be assumed that they are
all of the same political faith. This
is as it should be. The official that
performs his duty in this respect in
a broad and liberal spirit, with the
sole view of getting every qualified
voter on the great register is far
more likely to intrench himself in the
good opinion of citizens, regardless
of party, than the one who endeavors
.to use his office in the interest of the
democratic party, or any other
political organization. A broad
gauge policy in registration busi
ness is the only one that will com
mend itself to American citizens.
The republican county central com
mittee" should take a hand in this
matter without delay. That com
: mittee, into whose hands the inter
ests of the party are confided, can
perform no greater service to their
. party than by taking some steps to
see that republicans are registered.
If necessary, it should hire a suit
able man to go all over the county,
clothed with authority to register
voters, and call on them personally
for that purpose, paying all his
traveling expenses while on this
mission. The question of the small
registration fee should be allowed to
cut no figure in this arrangement.
Let the fee go to the clerk. -All re
publicans want is to have the same
opportunity, on a smaller scale per
haps, to register their men that the
democrats have. If democratic of
ficials are disposed to place a
stumbling block in the way of mak
ing an amicable arrangement of that
kind, le.t them show their hand, and
let the voters pass judgment upon
their conduct at the polls. .
THE ROAD BILLS.
The practice which has been fol
lowed in this county for years,
namely of the supervisors present
ing bills in their own name for road
work done in their respective dis
tricts and drawing the money there
for in a lump sum, is up to the dis
trict attorney for his legal opinion.
The Ledger has on several occasions
railed attention to this system. It
has contended, and still contends,
that it is contrary to plain provision
of the statutes, and that the bills
so allowed by the supervisors them
selves, are liable to protest by any
citizen; that if an appeal were had
to the courts, the chances are that
the claims would be declared illegal,
not because they do not represent
value received, but for the illegal
method of their presentation. In
no other county in the state can we
find a similar system prevailing.
The practice was adopted in Ama
dor under democratic rule. No pro
test was made against it for a num
ber of years, although it gave birth
to considerable adverse comment by
the people, particularly those who
have come here from other counties,
and who at once noticed the differ
ence between the course followed
here and the procedure in such mat
ters in the counties from which they
came. The law is mandatory —
nothing-more so in connection with
the county government — that a full
and complete record must be kept
in the minutes of the proceedings
of the board of supervisors. Not
only must a record be kept, but it
must be published in full. The pur
pose of this is obvious. Through
the county papers the citizens are
informed of every dollar paid by
order of the supervisors, and to
whom paid.^ The idea cannot be
tolerated for a moment that the law
is less exacting in such matters,
than a private corporation would be
in the transaction of its business.
What would be thought of the
directors of a mining corporation
who, under the plea of saving cleri
cal labor of book-keeping, should
lump all the claims for wages of em
ployes, and allow the bills in lump
form in their own names, draw the
money therefor, and then distribute
the cash to the individuals who
actually did the work. Would such
a> wage-paying system be tolerated
by any company? And yet that is
precisely the method that has been
followed in Amador county for years
so far as road expenditures are con
cerned. The names of the parties
who do the work and who finally get
the money have no place in the of
ficial records. The taxpayers are
kept in ignorance of the men em
ployed and the amount paid to each.
Look at the record in the minutes
published this week. Between $3000
and $4000 is allowed the supervisors
for labor on roads. Where else in
the state of California — or any other
state for that matter — will you find
a record like this. Who gets. the
benefit of this money? We know
the supervisors themselves do not,
for that is contrary to the spirit and
letter of the law. Why then is it
made to appear on the face, of the
minutes that they are the real bene
ficiaries. Why are scores of names
of claimants suppressed, and one
county official, who does not and
cannot under the law receive one
dollar for road work outside of sal
ary for overseeing the same, sub
stituted in their place? Why are
the taxpayers— who are the real em
ployers and wage-payers — kept in
the dark, when the law says they
shall be kept posted on such matters
by publication of itemized accounts.
If the system is meritorious as re
gards the road funds, why is it not
also applied to the current expense
and hospital funds? Why not allow
the superintendent of the hospital
to lump all the bills for hospital sup
plies and services in ona bill in his
own name, and draw the money, and
act as paymaster himself for that
institution? That would also save
clerical labor. Why not have the
county clerk put in a claim each
month for the sum total of all the
bills for current expenses, and pay
off the respective claimants? That
would save nine-tenths of the labor
involved in the present method of
keeping books. And it would be no
more out of ioint with legal enact
ments than the present" method of
auditing road bills.
The only reason that has been
urged in defense of this system,
apart from the mere saving of cleri
cal labor, is that to require each
wage-earner to put in a separate
bill would entail hardship and ex
pense upon them, inasmuch as every
bill has to be sworn to, and_this
would necessitate an appearance
before a notary or justice of the
peace. There is no merit in this ob
jection. We are informed the super
visors have been given to under
stand that they have no authority
as supervisors to swear the claim
ants to road bills. As a matter of
fact we know this has been done in
the past history of Amador county.
What is the meaning of this section
of the Political Code.
4028. Any member of the board (of •
supervisors) may administer oaths to
any person concerning any matter sub
mitted to them or connected with their
powers or duties.
Who will say" that this does not
confer authority to take the nec
essary oath of a claimant to a bill
against the county for road work or
any other 'service for which a de
mand is to be presented before the
board of supervisors. The opinion
of the district attorney on this ques
tion will be awaited with interest.
The divorce mill of Amador coun
ty has been running at an unusually
lively gait during the past year.
Between May 1, 1901, and May, 1902,
twenty divorce suits were started in
the superior court. In the same
period there were 80 marriage li
censes issued by the couuty clerk.
So .that the proportion of marriages
annulled by decree of the court to
the total of marriages solemnized is
one to four.

OFFERING REWARD.
SUnff Gregory appeared before
the* board of supervisors last Mon
day and urged that' body, to offer a
reward of 1250 for the apprehension
of young Gates, who he positively
asserts committed the Piccardo rob
bery. The board, after carefully
considering the matter, refused to
comply with the request by a unan
imous vote. •We believe they acted
wisely in so doing. Whila the crime
referred to stands out in boldness of
design and nerve of its execution
without a parallel '< in the criminal
annals of the county, it would be
stepping outside of the beaten track
of precedent for the county to offer
a reward for the apprehension of
the supposed perpetrator. Rewards
have been offered by this county in
cases of capital crime, but as far as
our recollection serves us, for noth
ing less. To offer a reward for. a
lesser offense would virtually throw
wide open the doors of the treasury
to appeals of the same import in. all
felony cases. Every lover of good
government will rejoice to see the
bold offender in this particular case
within the grasp of the law; at. the
same time, few would uphold the
supervisors for offering a big reward
in the matter. The reward system
in criminal cases is not without
grave objections. We have had ex
perience of its pernicious influences
in connection with crimes committed
in this county; crimes the enormity
of which justified the offering of a
reward— if the system is justifiable
at all. The cause of justice would
not be promoted by extending the
head money system, neither will it
be materially injured in this or any
other county by adhering to the
policy of refusing to apply it to
cases below the grade of murder.

The readers of this paper will be
pleased to learn that there is at least,
one dreaded disease that science has
been able to cure in all its stages and
that is Catarrah. Hall's Catarrah Cure
is the only positive cure now known to
the medical fraternity. Catarrah be
ing a constitutional disease, requires a
constitutional treatment. Hall's Catar
rah Cure is taken internally, acting
directly upon the blood and mucous
surface of the system, thereby destroy
ing the foundation of the disease, and
and giving the patient strength" by
building up the constitutional and as
sisting nature in doing its work. The
proprietors have so much faith in its
curative powers, that they offer one
Hundred Dollars for any case it fails to
cure. Send for list of testimonials.

NOTICE-^
When you are about to buy a suit
of clothes, it would be absurd to go
to a carpenter's shop. When in
need of medicine, you would not call
on # the blacksmith to prescribe for
you. To reasonable people it will
appear that to buy a suit there is
but one place, and that is the tailor
shop, where your suit can be fitted
on you before being made up;. and
where you can select your goods,
not from a piece of scrap on paper,
where in nine cases out of ten when
your suit arrives it isn't at all what
you selected. If you buy it home
you can select your goods from a
large assortment of piece goods, and
can see what you are getting for
your money. Your ready made
suits are pressed and remodeled with
no extra charge; this I guarantee.
Remember mine is the only place in
Jackson where you can. have this
done free of charge.
Have just received a brand new
line of spring and summer goods all
ready made and to be made up to
order. Men's, Youth's and child-
ren's clothing of the latest styles.
Trusting to receive a call from
you, and thanking 3'ou for your past
favors, and soliciting the same in
the future,
Max Ladar, the Tailor.

aped serious injury by an attack from
i hog. The child's parents wore at

viciously. Luckily Mr. Calvin's at

There was an exciting discussion
wfore tho supervisors last Monday
>rer the bill presented by Drs. Adams
itwl Frary for the sum of $250 for am
mtating the legs of Peter Lavella, who
vas run over by the cars, and who died
ihortly thereafter. The only peg that
vas relied upon to hold the county re
sponsible for the fees was that the
unstable employed the surgeons to
.ako charge of the case, after com
nunicating with the district attorney.
Che board, however, very properly it
eems to us, hold that neither thocon
it&ble nor the district attorney could
jind the county in such a case. The
listrict attorney strongly opposed the
illowance of the claim, and repudiated
;he idea that any word or act of his
:ould be construed into an authoriza
tion of the claim as a county charge.
The bilj was rejected by a unanimous
vote. ;. i

J. Mortimer, the decorative artist of
Jackson, was in Amador City all last
week employed in fixing up some offices
and business places there. He has also
been working there this week, and
talks of opening up a permanent place
of business in that lively town. He
says there is plenty of work around
there to keep a painter steadily em
ployed.

The funeral of Mamie Tarn, which
took place last Saturday, was one of
the largest witnessed' in Jackson for a
long time. Services were held in the
Catholic church, Iby the Rev. Father
Gleason. The floral pieces, of which
there wore fully 150, were marvelous in
design and workmanship, and testified
to the affectionate ' remembrance in
which the-young lady was held in this
com'tnunity,'* and' tho deep sympathy
for the bereaved family.
A call was issued for a meeting to be
held in Jackson last Saturday to con
sider the matter of having a fourth of
July celebration at the county seat.
The attendance was small, owing it
was said, to its being a busy evening,
so the meeting was postponed until
Wednesday evening. On that evening
no one attended. This lack of interest
has thrown a cold bath over the pro
ject. Probably the business men will
do something later on, when the time
becomes so limited that nothing can be
done effectually.
The Sacramento street fair will open
next Monday. It promises to eclipse
everything in that line ever witnessed
at the capital city. An attendance of
at least 40,000 people from the outside
is looked for. The hotels and restaur
ants have agreed not to increase rates
of board or lodging during the week of
festivity. ■ All the space on the midway
has been taken. No doubt there will
be a liberal attendance from Amador
county at this celebration. The peo
ple of Sacramento have simply outdone
themselves in their efforts to cater to
the pleasure and entertainment of
visitors.
Sunday Closing Movement.
We, the undersigned merchants of
Jackson, dealing in groceries, hard
ware, furniture, boots, shoes, clothing,
dry goods and millinery, do hereby
agree to close our respective establish
ments every Sunday, beginning on
May 11, 1902, and continuing up to and
including the sth day of October, 1902:

Thomas, V. Giovannoni & Co., Kelley
Bros., .S. Axelrod,- There are two
other firms to be added to the above
list. If these names can be obtained,
this laudable movement will be crowned
with success. If they decline to join,
of course the whole thing will be drop
ped. It would never do for one or two
business places to remain open and all
the rest agree to close. That would be
unjust to thoso willing to close. The
Ledger hopes all will fall in line, as no
merchant will lose any business if all
houses are closed on Sunday. Tho
same amount of business done In sevon
days, would be done in 6ix, and the
merchants and employes would have a
day of rest, which they are certainly
entitled- to.
Big Fire at Oleta.
The news reached Jackson Monday
morning that tho business portion of the
town of Oleta was practically wiped out
early that morning. The fire started
in the United States hotel, about 5
o'clock that morning, while preparing
for breakfast. Tho facilities for fight
ing fire are meager, there being a scant
supply of water. The flames spread
rapidly, and jumped across the street.
In a brief space. the town was literally
wiped out. Wo have been unable to
get the full particulars, but aro in
formed both hotels, United States and
Townsend House, two saloons, drug
store, and three dwellings, with all
their contents, wero destroyed. All
tho buildings were frame, and disap
peared in smoke very quickly. The
loss is hard to compute. It will prob
ably amount to between $15,000 and
$20,000. The aggregate insurance
amounted to less than $2000. The fire
is a serious blow to the struggling town.
It has been in a depressed condition for
a number of years, and this heavy blow
coming after a prolonged siege of dull
ness, makes it doubtful if the burned
district will \» speediiy restored.
THE AMADOB LEDGEB; JACKSON, CALIFOBNIA, FBIDAY, MAT 9, 1902.
THAT PICCARDO HOLD-UP
On the Trail of the Sup
posed Perpetrator.
His . Present Whereabouts Unknown,
General Impression That He
Has Left the State.
It is generally known, because it has
been freely circulated throughout the
county during the past week, that sus
picion strongly points to George Gates
jr, as the perpetrator of the hold-up at
Piccardo's saloon on the night of Fri
day, April 11. A chain of circum
stances has been forged that has so im
pressed the opinion of his guilt in the
minds of the officers, that no effort
whatever is now directed in any other
channel for the unravelment of that
bold crime except the discovery of the
whereabouts of that individual.
At the time we went to press last
week, Sheriff Gregory was on his way
back from Alaineda, whither he went
to locate Gates, and confirm or disse
pate the suspicions that had been
created respecting him. He left here
Thursday morning of last week, and
i expected to get back Friday. His
mission to the bay was only revealed
to one or two persons, with instruc
tions to tell no' one about the affair.
During Friday, however, the report
was all over the county that the sheriff
had caught his man, and would bring
him back that night. But he returned
alone, and repudiated the stories that
wore floating around, and was very in
dignant that his name had been con
nected with them as author. . It was
true that ho wont to Alaraeda, with
the expectation of bringing back the
accused. This expectation was basod
on information received from official
sources in that city, and which proved
to be false. Hence the dissapointing
outcome, and the circulation of the an
noying stories referred to.
From Sheriff Gregory we have ob
tained a full history of this remarkable'
case, rendered doubly notorious on ac
count of the ease with which the alleged
criminal has managed to slip through
the hands of the officers who have been
so eager to land him in limbo. The
facts show a lamentable lack of co
operation among the peace officers,
which is tho main cause of this
miscarriage of justice. ."; ;
The robbery was committed on the
11th of April, Friday, between 8 and 9
o'clock at night. For several days
previous to the robbery young Gates—
who was stopping at Nixon's hotel in
Sutter Creek— had appeared on the
street having a bandage on his hand,
one finger of which had been injured
while working in the Central Eureka
mine. He worked in the mine long
enough to earn $36. He was a frequent
visitor in Jackson. The morning after
the robbery he showed up in his room
at the hotel, and meals were taken to
his room by the waiters. It is also
claimed that his wounds were dressed,
and that bird shot was actually, picked
out of his arm by attendants, and all
these suspicious facts were kept from
the knowledge of the officers until long
after the accused had left the county.
Instead of being seriously wounded, as
was at first supposed by inspection of
the bloody duster found at the Bell
wother mine, Gates was around as
usual. There was uo lameness observ
able. No bandaged hand or arm was
In sight, according to tha orthodox
version. All this tended to avert sus
picion from him. A day or so after the
hold-up, Constable Kay saw him in
Sutter Creek, and Gates greeted him
with this remark as he held out his
hand in recognition: "Well, I suppose
you are after me. ' ' Others from Jack -
son saw him and drank with him dur
ing two or three days following the
crime, and if they saw anything that
aroused suspicion they kept their
thoughts locked up in their own minds.
On tho 14th he paid a month's board
at the hotel to landlord Nixon, amount
ing to $24. This was not in full. At
the same time he said he intended to
stay another month. This was the
last that Nixon saw of him. He left
Sutter Creek on the 15th, in the after
noon. It is believed that he took the
train at Valley Springs.
From a letter received by Sheriff
Gregory from the sheriff of Stanislaus
county, it appears that young Gates
was at a ranch near Modesto on the
20th, wounded in the wrist, and told
parties that the officers had his pistol;
that it was a cinch against him; that
he had been shot in the wrist.
On the evening of the 22d of April]
George Gates sen. arrived in Sutter
Creek. He inquired of the barkeeper
of Nixon's hotel where his son George
was, and was told that he was at
Paloma. He then asked, "Do you
know he is there." The barkeeper
suggested an inquiry direct by tele
phone, but Mr. Gates said: "Never
mind, I am going over there myself. "
He was given young Gates' room. He
came down early next morning, and
went off by stage, taking with him
young Gates' trunk, filled with all his
belongings found in the room.
The knowledge of Gates' visit to
Sutter Creek was known the same
night to at least one peace officer.
Constable Kay says he was In Sutter
Creek that evening, and saw him get
down from the stage, but he attached
no particular significance to the fact.
On tho 25th Sheriff Gregory was in
Sutter Crock, and heard for tho first
time about this brief visit, for tho sole
purpose as it seemed of taking away
the effects of young George. This fur
nished tho looked-for clew. He at
once communicated with the chief of
police of Alameda, to know if Gates
was at his home, and was answered
that ho was, but that there was noth
ing the matter with hjm. Not satisfied
with this, he determined to go In por>
son and invostigato for himself. Ac
cordirjgly he left Thursday of last
week, and on arriving in Alamoda,
went to Gates' residence in company
with a police officer of that city. Who
should open the door but George Gates
sen. The sheriff plainly told him his
unpleasant mission, and said that his
son was accused of the Piccardo rob
bery. The father said he was sorry,
that' he did not learn that business
from him; that the accused was not
there, neither was his younger son,
Vernon. He had no objection to the
searching of the premises, but said on
his honor as a man the officers' would
find nothing of an Incriminating nature.
The trunk which he had brought from
Sutter Creek was pointed out and ex
amined. It was empty. The new suit
which it had contained, wad missing.
The father manifested a sorely grieved
spirit over the affair, but not a sur
prise as if the sad tidings were heard
for the first timo.
Sheriff Gregory was completely
baffled, and returned home the next
THE RECOVERED OUTFIT.
It is more than probable that the
pistol, hat, bolt and duster recovered,
shot-pitted and bloody— the unmistak
able earmarks 'of this crime— were
stolen from a closet In Dr. Endicott's
office. Tho revolver is an old-fashionod
one, and was put in the closet loaded.
It was never used, and he did not miss
the articles until, after thoy were re
covored. He could not swear posi
tively that they aro his property, but
they are like articles of liko character
that he kept. It was not unusual for
young Gates to visit his office, and ac
cess to the closet was not difficult
either day or night. Dr. Endicott had
treated him for his crushed finger a
week or two before tho robbery. On
the night after tho robbery the doctor
and Charley Freeman were' in Sutter
Creek to get the paraphernalia for the
athletic club, and while there saw
Gates, shook hands with him, and went
up to his room, but nothing out of the
way was noticed either in his walk,
manner, or appearance generally.
The general impression is that the
accused has left tho state, If not the
country. -- . . ■
Back Broken.
Dr. Gall was called to Bear river
camp again last Sunday, on account of
a serious accident that occurred there,
by which a man named Vie Ferrara
received injuries that will probably
disable him for life. Ferrara was em
ployed upon the dam that is being
built at that camp. In hoisting by
means of a derrick an immense rock
that had been blasted from the quarry,
one of the guy ropes broke, and the
boom or pole fell, striking Ferrara
below the shoulders, injuring the spinal
column. The victim was paralyzed
below the hips. He was tenderly cared
for as far us possible, at the camp, and
preparations wore at once made to con
vey him to Jackson. The soft snow
between' Bear rivor and Ham's station
precluded the possibility- of conveying
him by sled. Tho only alternative was
to carry him on a litter over this stretch
of fourteen miles. This- was done.
Twelve men were needed for this ser
vice, six at a time changing at short
intervals. It took them only five hours
to reach Ham's station. From Ham's
he was brought down by conveyance,
and reached here about 5 o'clock Mon
day afternoon. Tho Standard Electric
Company are setting a noble example
In cases of accident to employes. In
this instance they bore all the expense
of surgical attendance, conveying tho
patient to Jackson, and will pay for
nursing, maintenance and medical at
tention here. The patient stood the
ordeal of tho trip remarkably well.
Dr. Gall reports that ho was much im
proved Tuesday morning. The sense
of feeling extended at that time to his
knees. Hopes are entertained for his
recovery.

Want a Hew Voting Precinct.
Harvey Calvin, of the Calvin Sta
tion, was in Jackson Monday on busi
ness with the board of supervisors.
He and others in Pioneer district are
endeavoring to get a new election pre
cinct created, to be carved out of
Antelope and Pine Grove precincts.
He says there are 60 names of residents
and voters in the proposed new pre
cinct signed to the petition in its favor.
As it is now some have had to travel
as far as eight or nine miles in order to
vote. This is a hardship that shoujd
not be tolerated whore fully 50 voters
can bo gathered in a much smaller
precinct. Some of tho old timo voters
of tho upper section are tired of this
self-sacrifice in order to exercise the
right of suffrage, and say if they are
not granted a new precinct, which will
relieve them to some extent from this
inflation, they will not vote. But, of
course, they will got over this when
the compaign warms up. You can't
keep ah American citizen from voting
on account of a trifling walk of ten or
twelve miles to get to the ballot box.
Anyhow their request under the cir
cumstances is not an unreasonable one.
Shudders At His Past.
"I recall now with horror," says Mail
Carrier Burnett Mann, of Lovanna, 0.,
"my three years of suffering from Kid
ney trouble. I was hardly ever free
from dull aches or acute pains in my
back. To stoop or lift mail sacks made
me groan. I felt tired, worn out, about
ready to give up, when I began to uso
Electric Bitters, but six bottles com
pletely cured me and made me feel like
a new man." They're unrivaled to re

Obituary- Notice.
Ida Ethel Avise, youngest child of
Mr. and Mrs. James Avlse, died at her
home near Jackson, May 6th, at the
age of 11 years 1 month and 27 days.
Little Ethel was never a robust child.
For the past two years she has suffered
from heart disease, and for months she
has been unablo to lie down, her par
ents often holding her in their arms so
she could rest. She had been ablo to
be around the house until Thursday,
when she was stricken down never to
get up again. Her sufferings at times
were revere as she would struggle for
breath, and often she would want to bo
taken up; again she would grow
weary and want to lie down. On Tues
day it became apparent to all that her
hours wore few. Several times during
her last illness she called for two of
her playmates from South Jackson.
On Sunday they wont to see her, but
she failed to recognizo them. On Tues
day afternoon thoy again went to see
her. Sho was sleeping. When she
awoke sho was asked if she • wanted to
see them, and she said "Yes." They
were called into the room, and to her
bedside. She looked at them with eyes
already dim, and asked that they
should kiss her. Then she called for
her box of candy, and with little fingers
already stiffened in death she tried to
take some for each of them. When it
was placed in her hand she opened her
eyes and asked: "Where is Cynthia
and Ethel, I can't see them." After
she had given them the candy they left
the room, and in a short time she laid
her head wearily on one side and said:
"Good-by. I'm going .to sleep for an
hour." Alas, it was the sleep that
knows no waking, and in a few
moments sho was no more. She was
the idol of tho home, and will be greatly
missed by all. Her chair at the table
by her father's side is vacant, and the
sound of her voice through the house
will be heard no more. Brothers and
sisters will come and go, but no little
sister will spring to welcome them.
Dear ones, do not grieve, for she has
only crossed the dark river a little
while before you, and is waiting with
sister and brother to welcome you to
that land where parting 3 never come.
She has left to mourn her loss, father,
mother, four brothers'and four sisters.

Stricken With Paralysis.
Stephen Hughes, the liveryman of
this place, was stricken with paralysis
on Friday of last week at Clements,
while returning with his son, Charles
Hughes, from a business trip to Stock
ton. This is the second stroke he has
had within the past year. The first
time he was stricken was nearly a year
ago, while he was at Lockeford on his
way home, but he soon recovered com
pletely, the paralysis being in his
lower limbs. This time his vocal
organs are attacked and he is unable
to utter a -vord. He is under the care
of Dr. Stuckey, A speody recovery is
the sincere hope of all our townspeo

MINING NOTES.
The Bay State Mining Company set
tlod for delinquent state and county
taxes last Monday. Tho taxes bave
been allowed to go delinquent for sev
eral yoars. The sum of $996.90 was paid
on account of delinquent taxes, and also
the amount due " for taxes for the
current; making considerably over
$1000 paid by this company. This is
an augury that tho outlook for the
mine is encouraging, and the intention
of the present company to complete i&s
purchase.
Keystone.— The first full monthly
clean-up of the Keystone since the ad
ditional stamps were added was made
recently and the result was highly sat
isfactory. Five thousand tons were
crushed during April. The yield
averaged about $4 per ton. This is a
low grade, but still a good paying
proposition under the improved con
ditions of mining that now exists at
the Keystone. It was expected to
start the air compressor to run the
hoisting machinery yesterday. An
other economical move under con
templation is to have all drilling ma
chines of the same make, and the Rand
drills have been j selected as the most
efficient. Six of these machines will
bo installed. The ore is taken from
the 900 levol and levels above, and the
ore bodies aro so vast in the . east voin,
upon which the present prospects of
the mine are based, that there is no
likelihood of searching below the
present works for a long time. About
100 men are on the pay roll; the use of
machine drills having reduced the
working force to some extent.
Bunker Hill.— The pay ore en
countered in this mine as stated last
week, has widened out. It Is now re
ported that' the ledge of high grade
rock is two feet .thick.
Argonaut-Kennedy.— Tho case of
the Argonaut Mining Company against
the Kennedy Mining Company, which
has been dragging its slow pace through
the courts for the last seven years, was
argued before the United States Su
preme Court in Washington on May
Ist, and submitted. A decision may
be rendered in a month, but it may be
six months before the matter is de
cidod. -'

FAD BECAME A MANIA.
fTempted by Harvard Book Plate*, m
Doctor Tnrned Tnlef.
It would seem from the experience
of the Harvard college library that
book plate collecting may sometimes
develop into a dangerous and expen
sive mania. A few ycars^ago theJSar
vard library fount] that the engraved
labels which it pastes on the inside of
the covers of its books as marks of its
ownership were disappearing from
some of the less used volumes. Th*
older book plates, it appears, are high
ly prized by collectors, and some^of
them are particularly valuable for.tfieir
artistic merit as well as foe interesting
associations with early book collect
ing in this country. These were natu
rally the special prey of the thief.
Detectives took the matter in hand,
and the offender was discovered with
full evidence of his guilt upon him.
He confessed to stealing the library's
property and to having it in his pos
session. By the time the matter reach
ed the courts the greater part of tHe
book plates had been restored, the thief
having settled satisfactorily with the
persons to whom he had sold or given
them, and, as the prisoner had repali}
the expense to 'which the library had
been put, the college consented to leave
the matter of sentence with the court,
which imposed a fine of $150 on ope
count and put the other count on flfe,
to be brought up again later If it should
be desirable, meanwhile placing i^e
offender under $1,000 bonds for his fu
ture appearance if he should be want
ed.
A striking point in the case Is that
the guilty man is ln_ no .way a^comiapri
criminal. His education (he ua's a 2e
gree of doctor) and his tnste seem onlj
to have made Jiis thefts more Intelli
gent and discriminating, however. He
knew the value of his peculiar botitiy,
and he knew how to dispose of fKilJjj
very personality being a protection to
him in that part of his mlsdemeonof.
Apparently the fad developed to a"|pa
nla and that to kleptomania in his
mind.
A number of the stolen plates have
not yet been traced at all, and collect
ors have been warned ngainst accept
ing Harvard plates of the older en
graved varieties unless there is unmis
takable evidence that they came hon
estly Into the possession of the person
who offers them.

A WONDERFUL ESCAPE.
Terrible Experience of s Hunter
- With an Indian Band.'
Oue of the most remarkable iastan^f a
of the escape of a white man from \m
Indians was that of John Colter, a S
mous hunter and trapper. On the qajr
in question he and his companion wQre
surrounded bj 600 savage warriors,
The companion was Instantly killed,
and Colter was captured. His foes ha 3
no intention of saving his life, Ijo^r
ever. They wanted' the sport of Ma
ting him to the torture or at least qj
playing with him as a cat plays wljjj a
mouse. The chief asked him if he
could run. • He said, "Not much."
He was released and told to save his
life if he could.
Colter darted away at high speed,
and most of the 600 savages set off ajf<
er him. There was a plain before hljfc
six miles wide, bounded on the far side
by a river fringed with trees. Colter
hud always been famous as a runnen
and his practice now stood him in gooq
stead, lie, made straight across tije,
plain for the stream, and the yells of
his pursuers lent him wings. His foes
had removed every shred of clothing
from his body, and the plain was cov
ered with prickly pears, so that his un
protected feet were lacerated at every
stride. J -;X
Half way across the plain he glanced
back and saw that only a few Indiana
were following him. Again be ran on
and soon realized that one of his pur
suers was nearlng him. He redoubled
his efforts, and blood gushed from hjs
nostrils and flowed down over ' his
breast.
The fringe of trees was near, but a
hasty backward look showed him the
pursuing brave close upon him with
spear raised. Moved by a sudden Im
pulse, Colter stopped, turned and faced
the savapo *vlth outstretched arms.
The Inui:..i \v::3 so taken aback at
this • unexpected movement that he
stumbled and fell! This was. Colter's
opportunity. He ran back, seized the
spear and, pinning his antagonist to
the ground, ran on. s' •''.'
Other savages came on, fiercer than
before at the death of their comrade,
but Colter reached the trees, plunged
into their midst and then into the river
and swam to a pile of driftwood that
had lodged. He dived beneath it and
stuck his bead up between two logs
covered with smaller timbers and
brush. . - -.--i'
The Indians came up and searched
for- several hours, but failed to find
him. Again and again tbey walked
over the driftwood. ' Luckily they did
not fire it. as he feared they would.
At last they went away. Then Colter
swam out and fled through the forest.
Seven days he went on, living on
roots and berries, with po clothing, un
til at lns»t he reached a trading post on
the Bighorn river. He never fully re
covered from the effects of this terrible
experience.— Youth's Companion.
IIIb Bonk Signature.
A case for a handwriting: expert was
noticed at one ot the downtown banks
the other dny. A treasurer of one of
the many charitable organizations of
this city' had received a check to be de
voted to that certain charity, and . he
was desirous o£ acknowledging it, but
could not read the signature. He took
the check to the bank on which It was
drawn and questioned one of the clerks
as to the signature and was told that
it was genuine, but could not get the
desired Information. It was next tak
en to the paying teller, who- also de
clared that it was genuine, but even he
could not make out who it was and
had to consult the card catalogue.
There was not the slightest resem
blance between the signature to the
check and the real name.— New York

It is a popular joke to say that there
rro but six horses In Venice, four over
tlic'iiortlco of St. Mark's cathedral and
two bronze animals of heroic size, one
bestrode by Victor Emmanuel and the
other by General Colleone. But this la
a mistake. There . are four other
horses, also of bronze,' ln the Church
of St. John and St. Paul, and quite a
lininbcr of. plaster and marble In the
different public buildings, making alto
gether at least fifteen or sixteen. Rus
kiu and other competent critics have
decluivd the statue of Colleone to be
the best equestrian monument ever
cast in bronze. It was designed and
cast by Andrea .Verrocchlo, painter,
sculptor, jeweler, engraver, poet and
musician, a man of infinite .genius,
whose greatest . fame lies in the fact
that he was the Instructor of the great
est artists of all centuries— Michael
Angelo, Raphael and Leonardo da Vin
ci. " The statue of Victor Emmanuel Is
not so highly thought of.
The horses on the top of St. Mark's
are famous and have had a trying ex
perience. They date back to the pre
historic age and ure supposed to be the
work of a Greek artist named Lysslp
pus and designed for a sculptured char
iot. They were taken to Rome during
the empire aud first used as ornaments
upon a triumphal arch erected by Nero
nnd afterward by Trajan. " The Em
peror Constautine took them from
Rome to Constantinople, where the
Doge Imndulo seized them as loot and
brought them to Venice. When Napo
leon entered the city in 1797, he had
them taken down from the roof of the
cathedral and shipped them in wagons
over the' Alps to Paris. . They served
as ornaments upon the triumphal arch
in the Place dv Carrousel till 1815,
when Emperor Francis I. of Austria
redeemed them, .and they were replac
ed, at his expense, where they now
stand. These ponderous animals are
of pure cupper, and each weighs about
"two tons. They were formerly gilded,
but the gold has been worn off by the
weather, nnd the verdigris which has
accumulated . upon the coppter gives
them a rich green tint— William E. Cur
tis in Chicago Herald. ■
OUR PRESIDENTS.
Only One Impeachment and bat Two
nesolutlontj of Censvre.
. Andrew* Johnson was the only presi
dent of the United States - ever im
peached, aud on the trial before the
senate he was acquitted, the vote in
favor of conviction barely falling short
of the necessary two-thirds.'. :
Two resolutions of censure on the
president have been passed, once by
the senate and once by the house, on
occasions when the ■ hostile majority
was not large enough either to pass
measures over the president's veto or
to impeach him.
The tlrst was passed by the senate on
March 28, 1 1534, censuring President
Andrew Jackson for alleged violation
of the constitution and laws by his re
moval of the government deposits from
the United States bank. The majority
of the senate was opposed to Jackson
in his war upon that bank, and this
vote of censure was the only thing
they conld do about It .. Jackson pro
tested- against this resolution as a
charge to answer which no opportunity
could be afforded him. The senate re
fused to receive the protest Finally,
on Jau. 10, 1837, the resolution of cen
sure was expunged from the Journal
of the senate.
The second resolution of censure was
in a report adopted by the house from
the house committee to which Presi
dent John Tyler's message vetoing the
tariff bill of 1842. had been referred.
This report censured the president for
alleged Improper use of the veto power.
Tyler protested against this, as Jack
son had done before him, but he had,
as a member of the senate, voted
against receiving Jackson's protest,
and In answer to his protest the house
sent him a copy of the senate resolu
tion on the former occasion.
Maklnar Errors.
A Massachusetts business firm prints
this paragraph at the top of its letter
heads: "Errors— we make them; so* does
every one. We will cheerfully correct
them if you will write to' us. Try to
write good naturediy if you can, but
write to us anyway. Do not complain
to some one else first or let the matter
pass. We want the first opportunity tQ
make right any Injustice that we max
do." The little sermon deserves a wide
audience. Few people have not had oc
casion at some time in their lives to re
gret the sending of a harsh or hasty
note of complaint It may be necessary
to assert one's rights in subsequent let
ters, but there is no better rule of cor
respondence than to make the first one
good natured.— Youth's Companion.
A Care For Scald Head.
. I have heard my grandmother say
she had cured many a scald head by
taking pure pine tar and enough lard
to make an ointment when melted to
gether so the tar won't stick, then keep
the head as clean as possible and oil
with the ointment. She said she had
seen it cure beads when the matter had
eaten seams In the neck,— Detroit Free

Animals and Salt.
Among certain people there is a
strong idea that nothing is worse. for
dogs than salt, but as a matter of fact,
when administered in small quantities,
it materially assists the process of di
gestion. There is no doubt, however,
that to give dogs or any other animals
broth or pot liquor In which salt pork
or bacon has been boiled would be al
most equivalent to giving them a small
dose of poison. The use of salt among
horses, cattle and sheep is advocated
by the highest veterinary authorities.
Pigs, on the contrary, arc extremely
susceptible to the' poisonous influence
of the agent, and experiments have
been made which had, after small
doses regularly administered, fatal re
sults. Habitually, as a matter of course,
all animals consume a certain portion
of salt, as it exists in certain propor
tions In most articles of food.— London

HARD TO GET STARTED.
Thlnstn Which Overcome a Writer
When Beginning An Article.
There is a f eeUng of timidity that
oftentimes overcomes a writer when
beginning an article. As In writing a
letter, it is getting started that puzzles.
It is the custom to begin with . slow
moving piston and work gradually Into
full speed until the flow of worfls Is
freej and then the difficulty with some
of us Is to find the Jbrake valve. Again,
a writer sometimes discovers that his
beginning Is a more fitting ending, and
vice versa. The newspaper style Is to
throw general conclusions up strong
under the headlines, while the sermon
lzer reserves ■ them until his final cli
max.
Thackeray remarked once that he
could never tell exactly what he was
going to say until his pen was in band
and under motion and then did not fully
realize Just what he was saying until It
was written. There is a subconscious
ness that shapes writing as it docs
speaking. This, I know, disturbs some
well known theories of speaking and
writing— as to weighing everything and
then measuring it out as a druggist
compounds a prescription — but my ob
servations are that the preparation Is
more in getting full of a subject and
then letting the mind work free under
the impulse of the dominating idea.
There are as many ways and meth
ods in writing and speaking as there
are individuals, and yet the fundamen
tal law In the transmission of thought
and speech runs largely In the same
groove, whether it be the Jargon of the
Hottentot or the polished periods of
the scholar. Human nature . has ■Us
own primitive impulses that defy all
rules of rhetoric and the power of ex
pression—that is. the power, mind you
—is deeper seated than any artificial
formula of stylists. — National Maga
zine.
SOME WRITERS.
Locke is said to have spent over six
years in the preparation of his essay,
"On the Human Understanding."
■ Lamartlne, the great French poet,
was happily married and received
great aid from his wife in all his un
dertakings.
The great Dante was married to a
notorious scold, and when he was in
exile be had no desire to see her, al
though she was the mother of his Six
children.
Wolfe is said to have written "The
Burial of Sir John Moore" In one even
ing directly after news had been
brought of the defeat at Coruna and
the death of the gallant British officer.
A friend of the late Walter Besant
relates that the novelist always kept
on his desk before him a list of the
characters of the novel he happened to
be at work on, their relationship and
appearance.
Hans Christian Andersen formed his
style by narrating his stories to vari
ous groups of children before he wrote
them down. His one thought was to
become famous, and he was very care
ful not to make Any enemies.
Dickens says In the introduction to
"David Copperfleld" that he spent two
years in the composition of that novel.
He did not usually require so long a
time, many of his novels being finish
ed in less than a year and most of his
shorter stories in a few days.
