- RARE HONOR BESTOWED ON PRESIDENT WHEELER
Hearst Hall to Be Opened January
'• ' 6th-7l)cgreßß That^ Have 'C
Been
- Uniyeksity.v'.vOf.; California,
Berkeley, January 3.— Enrichment
■of Western, scholarship _ undoubtedly;
j will result from the organization of the
new ! Philological . Association of the
Pacific Coast. Every university and
college of importance in California and
in Oregon and many schools and acad
emies sent representatives to the con
vention which was heldjast Friday and
Saturday in. the '■ Mark Hopkins Insti
tute of Art at San Francisco, for the
formation of the new society. The
first annual address was delivered ■by
President Ide Wheeler of , the. Univer
sity .of California. His address was
1 'Thel Place of Philology. V He said
that the study of language and litera
ture cannot be divorced, that litera
'.. ture is man's completes! self-expression,
and that literary^ appreciation and his
torical research should be inseparably
.interwoven with; the 'study of lan
guages. He protected against barren
formalism and pedantic absorption in
technicalities. ,~
"Chinese has many claims to be con
vsidered better adapted than any other
■tongue'' to- become the universal lan
!guagei" wiid Dr. John Fryer, Agassiz
jPcofessor of Oriental Languages in the
• University of California, in his address
to the philologists. Dr. Fryer declared
Chinese the most comprehensive and the
most expensive of languages. He said
that it is a language without a gram
mar, without punctuation, without
moods, tenses, cases, or persons, vet
possessing immense -flexibility of
adaptation and wide scope for expan
sion.
Scholarly papers on the Greek,
Latin, Semitic, German, Fi-ench, and
English literatures and languages weie
raad by philologists from Leland
Stanford Junior University of Cali
fornia, the University of Oregon, Whit
man College, Wash., and .by repre
sentatives of. a number of. other col
leges and high schools. The associat
ion adjourned at the end of a two
days', session, atyer electing . permanent
officers, arranging for regular, meet
ings hereafter, ami adopting a constitu
tion similar to that of tho American
Philological Association. Life mem
bership can be secured for a !©! of $50.
The expenses of the active member
ship will be small. .The publications of
the society promises to be of Impor
tance. The organization will un
doubtedly prove a powerful stlmulous
to original scholarships.
One of the greatest honors . which
can fall to the classical scholar has
been bestowed upon President Benja
min Ide Wheeler of the University of
California. Dr. ...Wheeler has been
made a ' corresponding member of the
Imperial Archaeological Institute of
Germany, a learned society conducted
under the auspices of « the ; , German
Government, which supports schools
of classical studies at Rome and at
Athens, and conducts excavations and
explorations in Greece, Italy, Asia
Minor, and other parts of the ancient
world. It is only with extreme rarity
that the honor of membership is con
ferred upon foreign scholars.
The ■ celebrated French, symbolic
poet, Henri de Regnier .Of Paris has
completed arrangements with the Uni
versity of California for a series of five
lectures, to be delivered at 3 o'clock on
the afternoons : of April 17, 19, 21, 23,
and 25, 1900, in Hearst Hall,' Berkeley.

His subjects will be jas follows:' '.'Par
nassians and Symbolists:' Origins '-. "of
Contemporary Poetry;" "The New
Poetry; School;" "The Poets of To
day—Future of Poetry;" "Alfred de
Vigny— A Precursor, " and ' 'Jose-Ma
ria" de Heredia."- The generosity of
Prince Poniatowskl has made it possi
ble for. these lectures to be. free of
charge for admission.
Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst will, Satur
day afternoon, January 6th, for the
first time welcome the students of the
University to Hearst Hall. Her hos
pitable doors will be thrown open for
all the members of the University and

largest Plant in the World.
It is not tho earth but the sea that
has produced the largest plant in the
world. That distinction is held by a
gigantic seaweed, known as the nereo
cytis, which frequently . grows to a
height of more than 300 feet. The
stem of tho plant is as strong as an or
dinary rope, and large quantities of it
are dried and used as rope by the in
habitants of tho South Sea Islands,
where the curious vegetable ropes are
found. This seaweed usually grows to
a depth of from 200 to 300 foet. As
soon -as the : plant takes root a spear
shaped balloon is formed, which grows
with the stem toward the surface of
the water. This balloon frequently has
a diameter of six feet or more. It has,
of course, an upward tendency, and
therefore keeps the stem growing until
it floats on the top of the water. This
enormous weed grows in such quanti
ties that large meadowlike islands are
formed, which lyo often so big as to
impede navigation. The ropes made
from the stems of the plant are used
for building purposes, and the balloons,
when dried, make very serviceable
vessels.
Young Mothers.
Croup is the terror of thousands of young
mothers, because its outbreak is so agonizing
and frequently fatal. Shiloh's Cough and Con
sumption Care acts like magic in cases of
Croup. |It has never been known tp fail. The

Life is not so very stagnant in North
Carolina if we may judge from those
items in a recent issue of a rural North
Carolina paper: "Major Williams
has. had his leg cut off in a sawmill.
Colonel Short happened to the acci
dent of having his head blown off 'by
a boiler explosion. Our new preacher
had his house burned down recently.
Five Morman Elders were tarred and
feathered yesterday. The new town
hall was struck by lightning on Tues
day. A circus mule kicked one of our
leading citizens on Saturday evening
last. The new Coroner was run over by
a railroad train Wednesday. There is
no news of importance in town."

It worked like a charm." ' Tb^e only' harmless

yesterday for assault, on a warrant
sworn out by Tom Irvine. V. His case
came up -in Justice Carpender's court
this morning, and in half an hour Bur
rell was acquitted. . ,
A day or two ago Burrell went to
Sacramento, leaving the bar of the ho
tel in charge of Irvine, who, as soon as
he was left alone, commenced to fill up
on ali the good things which "Happy
Tom's" place affords, until he was "un
fit for publication. " In response to a
telephone message, telling of the : state
of affairs, . Burrell hurried home, and
the first . thing he did upon entering
the hotel was to order Irvine'out. j Ir

hotel and.'.'Happy Tom, " employing
his usual method ol ridding himself of

Another accident happened in the
Lightner "mine last Wednesday fore
noon. An Austrian named John Kos
tovich attempted to step' off the skip
while it was in motion, with the result
that the bonnet of the skip struck
him. He was badly i cut on the head,
side of neck and breast. It is said that
it is impossible for him to recover. ' ;■:
Of course nobody could be blamed
but the unfortunate man himself, as it
was undoubtedly a piece of gross care
lessness on his part, unless he was
obliged to do so in order to save him
self from going into the sump, or to
avert some other fatal Occident.
E. E. Wood, the Angels attorney,
filed another action in the Superior
Court last Wednesday against C. R.
Beale of San Francisco, proprietor of
the Calaveras Citizen, and C. O, Zieg
enfuss, the editor and publisher of the
paper, to recover $5000 ■, damages
claimed to have been sustained by him
by reason of certain alleged libelous ar
ticles which appeared In the issues of
the paper between the 11th of Novem
ber and the 23d of December of the
present year. As will be remembered,
Wood commenced suit against that
paper shortly after - the publication of
November 11th, asking $2000 damages,
and also Instituting proceedings under
the Morehouse signature law, which
which imposes a fine of $1000 for a viola
tion of its provisions. The case finally
came up for hearing and was dismissed
on demurrer. \n the meantime and
between the dates above named that
paper retorted in rather caustic criti
cisms of the plaintiff, so the latter tiled
a new complaint on the first charge,
also bringing in the matter contained
in the later • publications as additional
counts to his complaint, and asking the
the Court to award him damages in the
sum of $5000,' costs of suit and such
further relief as the Court may deem
agreeable to equity. In this complaint
nq action is taken under the Morehouse
law.

It has been the custom from time im

roads to carry, in ' flasks and bottles,
samples of the " jira-jam ': producing

representative of the New Era ■ Was a
witness to a very < funny transaction
one day during the early part of the
week, while at the ■ depot ■ in : Sonora.
Just as the evening train pulled jin at
the station from Jamestown, one of two
gentlemen seated in the smoker] pro
duced a flask of the article, and,' pour
ing out a generous drink, handed it to
his companion, who, probably remem
bering a promise he hsd ' made his best
girl before leaving ; home, not to drink
while on - the journey, : held it in ; his
hands a few moments, then threw the
contents of the glass out of tho win

standing on the platform, conversing
with a friend. ■

A new. advertising scheme was re
cently employed by - a firm in a South
ern city... The junior partner of the
firm swore out a warrant for the arrest
of the senior partner on the ground
that he was selling goods below cost,'
and that the firm was constantly losing
moDey thereby. ~
The case came up in court, and the
counsel for the senior partner asked
for. a postponement in order to have
more time to prepare , his case. The
Judge granted the request, bail was
fixed, and the senior member released.
As he left the courtroom the junior
partner arose aud exclaimed, "If he is
released the sacrifice will go on!"
The news soon spread and the firm
did a better business.
When the case was again called no
plaintiff appeared and the charge was
dismissed. ■ The firm had succeeded in

Found a Petrified Canoe.
While hunting a short time ago,
John Barrett and Frank Brockliss
found a petrified canoe about one- third
of the way up to Job's Peak. It is
about sixteen feet feet long and four
feet wide. A petrified oar lies across
the top of the craft. About 100 feet
higher and directly back of the canoe
is a cave which extends into the side of
the mountain- about 100 feet. The
average width of the cave is about
twenty-five feet and it is about fifteen
feet to the ceiling. The) place shows
many signs of having inhabited. The
boys will - explore further ~as soon as
the snow will permit and bring the

MISCELLANEOUS.
CURIOUS CUCKOOS.
The_ cuckoo is^, generally known only"
as a bird with a very monotonous note :
a continuous cry of "cuckoo, cuckoo"
over and over again. Among naturalists,
however, the cuckoo is known as a bird
that never builds a nest for itself, but
takes advantage of one already built by
some more industrious bird. : ' -
There is a good deal of the cuckoo
about these advertisers who, instead of
making a success of their own, seek to
profit Dy the success which some one
else has made .with ...much effort and
labor. It is so with those imitations of
Dr. Pierce'a methods, by which free
nit Jical advice is offered, although those
who make the offer are without qualified
medical ability or experience. And the
cry raised in some cases of "woman,
woman, woman write to woman " makes
the resemblance ; to the cuckoo even
stronger.'
There is as far as known no qualified
woman physician connected with any
proprietary medicine establishment, and
none therefore competent to give medi-
cal advice. It is certain that there is no
one, man or woman, who can offer free
medical advice backed by such knowl-
edge and experience as is possessed by
Dr. R. V. Pierce, chief consulting phy-
sician to the World's Dispensary, Buffalo,
N. Y. For over thirty years Dr. Pierce
has made a specialty of the treatment
of diseares peculiar to women. In that
time heias treated over half-a-million
-^»otn«jt,-nii»«ty-eiglit-|>er-ccnt. of -whom
have been perfectW cured: Every sick
woman is invited to consult Dr. Pierce
by letter absolutely without charge or
cost. I Every letter is held as strictly pri-
vate and sacredly confidential, and all
answers are mailed securely sealed in
perfectly . plain envelopes bearing uo
printing whatever upon them.

CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP.
The Amador County Publishiug Company has bought
the Amador Ledger, and will edit and publish this paper,
discontinuing the publication of the Amador Republican,
which it has owned and published for some years.
, That the publication of two Republican papers in Jackson
has been unwise from a business standpoint, always has been
realized by every one in , the community, except R. Webb,
who was instrumental in establishing the Republican. No
one has realized this more vividly than the editors of the two
papers. For two years past matters pertaining to a consoli
dation of the Ledger and the Republican or a purchase of
one by the owner of the other has been discussed and con
sidered, while the advisability of such a course has received:
the attention ., of many of the leaders in business and in
- politics throughout the county. On January 2, 1900, the
matter was settled to the satisfaction of all parties con
cerned by the consummation of the sale of the Ledger to
the Amador County Publishiug Company, which company
has. decided to discontinue the publication of the Republican
and devote its energies to increasing the glowing influence of
the Ledger for the betterment of Amador county.
With this change in ownership comes my retirement
from the newspaper business in Amador county after seven
years as editor and proprietor of the Amador Ledger.
The ups and downs of a newspaper man's experience
were never better illustrated than by the experience of the
Ledger during the last seven years. During, it all the
LEDGER and its proprietor have come up smiling after every
knockdown, and he, by the exercise of a little pluck and
energy, has managed to keep the paper in the front rank of
journalism along the Mother Lode.- During the seven years
it has set the journalistic pace for the county, and its owner
and editor has a right to feel proud, and does feel proud of its
The Ledger, has made - many friends by its upright and
honorable course in its dealings with all men and measures,
and is proud of them. At the same time it has incurred
the ill will and enemity of some people from whom it has
pulled the mask, exposing them to the broad light of day
through its columns. Some of these, aye, many of them,
have taken the course of the LEDGER as a personal matter,
'..but, as all honorable and respectable papers and their editors
are proud of their enemies, the Ledger is doubly proud of
those it has made. . .
fl ■•'•'■The s writer hereof could fill a book with his experiences
as a journalist in Amador county, but as all of the con
temptible, connubiating and infamous intrigues directed
against him have been exposed by this paper and thoroughly
understood by its readers and friends, they have signally
failed of their intention and thus have come to naught, and
on this occasion further reference thereto is unnecessary.
The course of the Ledger in the future will doubtless
be upward and onward. • The conditions are ripe in this
community for a powerful Republican newspaper, which it is
- the intention of the present owners to make it, as well as to
keep it the leading newspaper and the leading advocate of all
of the material interests of Jacksoa and of Amador county.
That they will receive the hearty assistance of the people in
the matter- of subscriptions and advertising, which are so
necessary to make, a successful newspaper, there can be no
doubt, and with these the future success of the Ledger is
And, now, knowing that my newspaper experience in
Amador county has closed ; believing that with its close I will
leave a congenial association with the other newspaper men
in the county ; fearing that with its close will come changing
scenes and other climes ; and forever mindful of the many '
favors for which I am under the greatest obligations to ad
vertisers, subscribers and other patrons and friends, I bid the
newspaper world of Amador county farewell.

DESERTING THE SINKING SHIP.
'■:• P°Pg un organs of the Democracy are. still telling
the people that Bryan and sixteen to one is the proper slogan
for the party in 1900. They are, on the average, using syn
dicate editorials issued by the Bryan information bureau and
sent broadcast throughout the land in the hope that the lazy
or tired Democratic editor will incorporate them in theedito
rial columns of his paper to save labor, and thus become
responsible for their publication. Almost daily some paper
comes^to this office whose editorials wear the earmarks of the
syndicate. In the light of the fact that the leading men of
the Democratic party throughout the United States are. fall
ing away from Bryan and his cause these syndicate editorials
are, to the minds of thinking men, the veriest rot. That
they are leaving him and his cause like rats leave a sinking
ship there is no doubt. The latest Bryauite to catch' the
infection is W. S. McComas, editor of the Democratic Maga
zine, published at Chicago, who concludes an article entitled,
"Breakers Ahead" in the current number of that magazine
with the statement that the nomination of Bryan.' against
McKinley in 1900 "means foregone disaster to Iris jparty."
Mr. McComas has been, up to this" time, an advocate ttij-ough
good and evil report of the Chicago. platform, silvety. knd
Bryan-^always Bryan. •
I He says also that he, in common with others, has been
deterred by a feeling of delicacy and by a desire to avojd giv
ing offense from speaking the plain truth. Then he sets
forth that the belief has grown up throughout the laqd that
Bryan cannot lead to victory this year; that the party must
remain divided while he is the leader. The philosophy of
that belief is dismissed with the reflection, illustrated by the
citation of Henry Clay and James G. Blame, that popular
idols are not often elected President. The leaders of the
party, it is explained, "realize this, but seem x to' choose defeat
rather, than encounter hostility that is as unreasoning as
it is pitiless. Mr. Bryan is asked- to sacrifice himself this
time with the certainty of nomination and election four years
article, concludes : " The discussion of the. ques
tion of Mr. Bryan's successor would be premature. Though
many names are being mentioned, privately, it is certain that
their eligibility should not be canvassed until the general ques
tion of leadership has first been settled. They are" agreed
that Mr. Bryan's renomination would mean a repetition of
the disaster of 1896 and in a worse form. It is for the party
jto choose between certain defeat and possible victory,"
WRECKED THE OFFICE.
An attorney, E. E: Wood of Angels Camp, who 'had a
grievance agajnst the Calaveras_Citizen of San" AtKJreas_jen_
tered the office of that paper and wrecked the forms which
were almost ready to be put to press for the last current issue
of the paper. The act was committed by Wood while enraged
over a number of articles reflecting upon him as an attorney
and citizen, Which .appeared in different issues of the Citizen,
and because of which he^_had brought suit against the man
agement of that paper for damages. .'Just prior to the <'act
Wood met C. O. Ziegenfuss, the editor, on the street ; and
demanded to see what was in the paper about him that week.
Ziegenfuss calmly denied the request and slowly walked
away. Wood went directly to. the office, and, finding the door
locked, forced it open and did the job. As he was leaving
the place, he remarked to a bystander that he guessed
nothing would be in the paper about him that week, or words
to that effect. The only legal steps possible, under the cir
cumstances for Ziegenfuss, in. the matter, is to prosecute
Wood for malicious mischief and a civil suit; for damages.
The latter, however, is hardly feasible, as Wood is said to be
judgment proof.. Everything considered, Mr. Wood is ex
tremely fortunate even though he receive the full penalty of
the law for his crime, as there are but few newspaper people
in the country who would not go "gunning" for him under
the circumstances. i ■• !; -.
i ■ Various amendments and changes have been made in
the county ordinances since they were published a few months
ago. It would be \yell at this time for the District Attorney
to have the license ordinance, No. 91, so amended that. it' will
be clear to all, whether saloon men who were in business
when the ordinance was passed have to secure a licence by
the prescribed course this year or not. The ordinance' reads
so it is subject to either interpretation, and it should be made
clear enough to be understood by all who read.. License
Collector Gregory says it is necessary to get a new licence,
while the District Attorney says it is not. -jlvf:*
By noting the proceedings of the Board of Supervisors
it will be observed that the contract to make maps was
awarded to John Brown, the supervision thereof being made
the duty of the County Surveyor. This should cause no
delay in the prosecution of the suit to recover on the bond
of .the ex-Assessor,
In the news columns of the LEDGER this week will be
found an editorial from the San Francisco Post, the title of
which is "The Love of Dirt." Attention of the citizens of
Jackson is called thereto. Comparisons are "odorous," and
at the same time unnecessary.
The way people are asking for saloon licenses it would
seem that there is a growing belief that there are not enough
saloons in Jackson.

Indisposition of Manjtind Generally to Sub-
Jig mit trf Sanitation. 9§ •. £
I An Eastern newspai»6r, conamen'ting
upon the indisposition ofimanfeAid gen
erally to submit to sanitary innovation,
refers to tho population of Havana,
Cuba, as the most incorrigible on earth.
The American, military authorities who
have been running that city for some
time have- insisted upon sewering,
scrubbing, deodorizing and sterilizing
tho town, and on alP sides ithe pe6[iki
aro objecting to the process and mak
ing invidious comparisons between tho
methods of tho Araercan health officers
and ...the tyranny of 'tho Spanish tax
gatherers.. .Evidently; they, think it
was easier to get along- with tho Span
iards than It is now with tho Ameri
cans, since thoy aro being made tho
victims of cleaning-up processes, | whigh
thoy rogard j with holy horror, j In
deed, -one. newspaper openly declares
that they prefer to be left undisturbed
with their Dlth and death rate.
But this attempt to force cleanliness
upon tho people of Havana is not being
.met with any less hilarity than the
American civilizing methods are being
received in tho Philippines. A Manila
correspondent for.: an Eastern news
paper wroto the other day that General
Otis had made tho people of Manila a
great deal cleaner than they cared to
be made, and ho predicts' that if. the
American General porsists in his sani
tary plans, he will soon have tho na
tive population in rebellion.
These things sound* exceedingly
funny, but it will be remombored that
tho population of Bombay a few years
ago persisted in dying of tho plague
rather than submit to sanitation.
But are the barbarian tribes of tropi
cal countries the only people : who re
sist cleanliness? We remember ' that
when Colonel Waring took : charge of
tho New York Street Cleaniug Depart
ment his sanitary .schemes j were re
sisted with great strength by Tam
many Hall, and . when he ' was finally
turned out of office by Boss Croker,
the people rojoiced .that .they could
freely return to their muddy streots
and foul-smelling sewers. This sounds
funnier still.
The. antipathy which most people
have to cleanliness is one of the mar
vels of history. It can be explained on
no theory except that it is natural for all
animals to be dirty. — San Francisco

The Good Hope Mine Wasn't
Jumped.
SOME RICH ORE STRUCK IN THE COMMODORE
Strike Made at the Schneider Mine
in £1 Dorado County— Activity
in Tuolumne.
AMADOR COUNTY.
Good Hope— Jackson.
Last Sunday, just after midnight, an
attempt was to have been made to jump
the Good Hope mine. It had been sup
posed that the assessment work for
1899 had been performed, when Judge
Davis, who has lately become inter
ested in the mine, returned from San
Francisco Saturday night he gave or
ders that tho company resume work
upon the mine beginning at 6:30 p. m.,
Sunday, and continue assessment work
until a full $100 worth of work should
have been completed in 1900. This
was done as a matter of precaution.
Just before the shift began work it de
veloped that parties who had gained
considerable notoriety in this commun
ity, by certain kinds of mining opera
tions had made elaborate plans to jump
the mine just after midnight. Their
"gun fighter" had been picked out but
was of the class of men who "talk too
much" so the plan miscarried.
Judge Davis is entitled to the thanks
of the mining community for defeating
the scheme of the would-be jumpers.
EL DORADO COUNTY.
Placerville Nugget: A strike has
been made at the Schneider mine near
El Dorado. This mine is bonded by
Seymour Hill and C. F. Bryant., Last
summer a tunnel was run 750 feet and
it was crosscut to the east. Yesterday
a cut was made forty feet into the vein,
showing plenty of free gold, the vein
being three feet in width. This mine
adjoins the Griffith and Coleman.
Placerville Democrat; Superinten
dent Edward Bind of the Blue Gouge
mine, returned from a business trip to
San Francisco, Wednesday. He re
ports improvements at the mine as
progressing very satisfactorily. The
frame work of the mill proper is up
and enclosed, and. with the machinery
all on the ground, Mr. Bind hopes to
have the mill running within two

Eighty stamps are dropping at the
Gwin mine. There are about 170 men
on the payroll.
The work of sinking &t' the Vorlan
der has been stopped, and preparations
are now being made to crosscut the
lead.
San Andreas Prospect: Some very
rich rock was struck last week in drift
ing north on the 300-foot level of the
Commodore mine, which is situated
about one mile west of San Andreas.
The rock is of an excellent character
and will go between $5 and $6 to the
ton. Mr. Clary, the superintendent,
informs us that he has already twelve
feet of this rock, but tho full width of
the vein has not yet been determined.
Twelve men are employed at the mine,
work is going ahead in an active and
systematic manner; the present outlook
for this property is very good/
San Andreas Prospect: The Golden
Eagle mine, situated near Lloyd's
ranch, is thought by many who are
" familiar with its. history to be one of
the best outside mines in the Sheep
Ranch section. Years ago the' rock
was. worked from it an*d was rich
enough to pay all expense of sinking.
The ground was somewhat . of "a loose
nature, requiring much timbering 1 arid
extra expense when considerable depth
was made. Lack of capital on the part
of the owners was the only reason that
caused suspension. It is hoped that
this property will be reopened jin the
□ear future.
TUOLUMNE COUNTY.
The mill on the Arbon started up
again on the Ist. The force in the
mine will be increased.
Work on the north extension of the
Mt. Jefferson has commenced. A
shaft will be sunk 500 feet, more or
less, until striking the vein. ; • """ ',
Tho forty stamps at tho Rawhide
mine are dropping regularly. r /The
work of sinking the shaft was discon
tinued upon reaching tho 1700-foot
level. Sixty-five employes constitute
the present working force.
Carters New Era: The Progressive
Development Company, incorporated
last wees with a capital stock of $100,
000, divided into" 200,000 shares at 50
cents per share. At present the com
pany is directing all attention to the
Ida Dell mine, situated between Car
ters and Confidence, and the prospects
are encouraging in the extreme. We
understand that the stock is not on the
market.
Sonora Union Democrat: Crosscut
ting to the hanging-wall, drifting to
the west and sinking the shaft are
the present points of operation in tho
Little Wonder at Big Oak Flat. The
main shaft has reached a depth of 150
feet, the vein averaging four feet in
width and the milling ore givea a re
turn of $8 to tho ton. In one of the
crosscuts to tho hanging-wall a rich
shoot of high-grade ore was struck.
About 100 feet east of this crosscut the
same shoot was cut and another cross
cut is being run seventy-five feet lower
down, with tho object of tapping tho
same ore body. Preparations are un
der way for tho erection of a ten-stam p
mill.
Machinery for Union Copper Mine.
Stockton Mail: The Globe Iron
Works this morning received on the
steamer T. C. Walker a sixty-two inch
coabioatiga radial drill of tho latest
improved pattern, 1 which..^ was pur
chased in Cincinnati, b'y\E, i/ P.,Cadle on
his recent trip to'theiKaft.^The drill
is a fine piece of work mauship and con
tains buvuial impiovemeuld that will
enable it to do faster and botter work
than drills of tho old patterns can do.
Last Saturday the same firm gent
two seven-foot V gears and pinions to
the Union copper miuo at Coppor
opolis. This is the mine which is
being pumped out in order to get the
shafts clear for working. In hoisting
water some of tho machinery was
cracked and the gears and pinions sout
/iom here were intended to replace de
fective pieces.

CULLINGS FROM PINE GROVE
Pine Grove, January 2.— The
weather in this section has been great
for ducks and gravel mines.
The roads hore are in a deplorable
condition, but, owing to the frequent
rains, it would be a waste of money to
attempt to repair them.
Merhants of Volcano are paying
freighters 1 cent a pound for hauling
goods from lone, and very, few of the
teamsters a'reTwilfingj to ti aul/evon at
those figflrete. 1?J g is\s
Manuel Santifero, while".atjirork in a

Clara gulch, .mot , with a. very. painful
acefdont Monday. '"^Whrle other em
ployes of tho claim wore pitching wood
over an embankment, one of the pieces
struck him on the leg, inflicting a very
painful wound. It will be a number of
days before Mr. Santifero will be able
to resume work.
C. B. Calvin, William Southard and
Captain J. Miller are gulch mining in
Calaveras county, near Railroad Flat.
Clarence Bradshaw, the genial super
intendent of the McLaughlin ditch, is
kept busy these days catering to the
wants of the many patrons of the ditch
company.
C. C. Luttrell, an amiable merchant,
made a flying trip to the valley last
week, returning Sunday.
From parties just returned from the
Bear river camp of the Standard Elec
tric Company, I am informed that
there is at present about eighteen
inches of snow, and that there is no
snow below Ham's station. At, one
time this winter there was about five
feet of snow at the camp and it took
fifty men about five days to clean eight
miles, of road, to enable the taking in
of supplies. It is said tho animals in
there were four days without hay.
There are at present about sixty men
employed at the camp and all seem to
be getting- in. almost full time. It is
stated by well-informed people that the
work on this dam is equal, if not su
perior, to anything in the State. *-;
Work on the Manuel Santifero claim
is progressing, and such praise is due
to the Messrs. Watkins for tho way
they are operating this mine. What
we want in this section is a few more
men like r * operators of this prop
erty^ / *■*;*,- '
The Pine Grove Hotel is once more
open .for > business. This time it is
under the' management of Otis Web
ster and his estimable wife. The en
tire building has been cleaned and ren
ovated and* new furniture supplied
throughout. I predict for the new
management success in the now ven
ture. > < ? • ":»'" :»'-
James Lowry has reopened the
Olympia .Exchange. He has a lease of
the building" formerly occupied by the
Tennessee Mining Company as an office.
Clarence. . Bradshaw. and Frank
Biakeiey have fenced in a number of
acres in the rear of the Bradshaw res
idence, and intend sowing it to grain.
The fencing in, of this land closes, up
what is known as the "Ranch Hall
cut-off. U — WhJo it_is- iL_clctrhnent__to
the teamsters, it is a good thing for the
ranchers along the road, as the teams
passing back and forth cut up the road
so thatit was almost impassible.

The Jackson Gate Shooting.
Investigation reveals the fact that
the party at Cassassa's place, which
broke up so unceremoniously New
Year morning by tho attempted mur
der of Mrs. Cassassa and the sulclJo of
Louis Cassassa, had completed a dance
and gone to the bar to drink. Louis
Cassassa hung back and refused to go
up to tho bar, though repeatedly in
vited to do so. When the others had
reached tho bar ho shot at the lamp in
the room and hit tho ceiling. Ho then
fired a second shot, which hit Mi's.
Cassassa in tho arm, after which it en
tered tho baby's thigh. Tho fourth
shot went through tho bar. The fifth
penetrated tho shooter's brain and
produced death.
The suicide had threatened to take
his own life many times sinco he came
to this county about three years ago.
Only a month ago he met a young man
on tho road and told him he was going
to ask the young man's sister to marry
him and if she refused he would kill
her and then suicided.

YIELD OF GOLD FOR 1899
Experts Estimate the State's
MINT OFFICIALS PREPARE PRELIMINARY REPORT
Showing an Increase of Over One
: Half a Million Dollars Over
the Product of 1898.
S While it is yet too soon to expect a
complete account of the value and dis
tribution of the bullion product for
1899, Frank A. Leach, superintendent,
and Charles G. Yale, statistician of
the United States' Mint in this city,
have prepared a preliminary statement,
based on receipts at tho United States
Mint and other bullion depositories on
this coast, which shows that California
produced in 1899 gold to the amount of
$15,000,000 and silver $636,000. As in
the previous year the " State on the
same basis of estimate, only showed a
product of $14,438,601 and silver $415,
394, there has been an increase in 1889
of $561,406 in gold and $220,606 in sil
ver, or a total of $782,012 for the year.
This increase in the bullion product
is somewhat unexpected in view of the
record "dry year" through which the
State has just passed. During the
summer of 1899 numbers of quartz
mills throughout the mountain coun
ties closed down for some months
through lack of water. Tho gravel
mines as well as those of quartz were
seriously incommoded, tho river-bed
miners alone being benefited. In' Kern
and other southern counties, however,
where no dependence is placed on water
power for mills, all being equipped
with steam-power plants, thero has
been an increase of gold produced.
According to these experts, however,
the lack of water has been taken ad
vantage of to repair, onlarge and ex
tend water courses and strengthen res
ervoirs throughout the mining regions
to an extent that will appreciably in
fluence tho supply for 1900.
Messrs. Leach and aYale have also
prepared a corresponding estimate of
the output of Alaska mines during 1899,
which shows that the Territory has
doubled its gold product over the pre
vious year. The record for 1899 is:
Gold, $4,917,821, and silver, $82,680, as
compared with an output of gold of
$2,517,121 and of silver of $49,152 in
1898. This shows an increase for the
year of $2,400,700 in gold aud $33,728
silver, or a total of $2,434,428.
An attempt has been made in con
nection with the Alaska output to
segregate the amounts of gold re
ceived'so as to approximately deter
mine the yield of - tho gold fields at
Cape Nome, about which many con
flicting statements have been made. It
is found that of the total output of
Alaska, $2,408,830 gold and $3935 silver,
-came from the - beach and tundra
placers of Capo ' Nome and vicinity.
This is a remarkable record for a camp
only in existence one year, to double
the output of its territory in that short
time. The Nome placers have in 1899
apparently practically equaled in gold
product the combined output of the
quartz mines of Douglas and Unga
islands and Southeastern Alaska, and
of the placers of Manook, Circle City,
Forty-Mile and other Yukon river dis
tricts.
The gold product of tho Klondike
shows a large increase for 1899, for tho
yield is tho greatest of any year si nee
the discovery. The Klondike gold out
put for the year is $16,110,129 aud tlu
silver $114,617. In the year 1898 tho
gold yield was $11,038,478 and silver
$80,498, so an increase of Klondike
gold is shown of $5,071,651 and of sil
ver $34,119, the total increase being
$5,105,770. The Klondike annual gold
yield thus for the first time eclipses
that of California, and by about a
million dollars.— San Francifco Chron

IN REGARD TO TIDE LANDS
Decision Which Affects the
Mines at Cape Nome.
LUHSTBEBIR»« POSITION THEY HOW HOLD
Can Work the Claims Only So long
as They Are in Actual Oc
cupation Thereof.
A question of much local importance
has just been decided by Commissioner
Hermann of the General Land Office,
regarding placer mining on the beach
of the Behring Sea off the coast of
Alaska at and near Cape Nome, the
new goldfield. The decision a.iocts
mining and locations embracing tide
lands below the lino of ordinary high
tide. Numerous applications are
pending before the Interior Deparmont
as to locations on such lands, which
have been demonstrated to contain
gold. Individuals or associations of
persons, and incorporated mining com
panies are seeking concessions from the
Government, by which they may ac
quire exclusive mining rights and priv
ileges pertaining to such tide lands.
The commissioner decides that tide
lands in tho District of Alaska are not
public lauds subject to disposal to in
dividuals under any of tho existing
land laws of tho United States, and that
the department has no statutory author
ity to make concessions to individuals of
any mining rights portaining to such
tide lands.
A citation is made by tho Commis
sioner to the case of Shiveley vs.
Bowl by, decided by the United States
Supreme Court, in which it was held
that the United States on acquiring a
territory, whether by cession from one
of the States, or by treaty with a for
eign country, or by discovery and set
tlement, takes the title and the do
minion of lands below high-water mark
of tide-waters for the future States to
be created out of the territory, and it
was further held that Congress has not
undertaken, by general laws, to dis
pose of lands below high-water mark of
tide-waters in a territory, but unless in
case of some international duty of pub
lic exigoncy, has left the administration
and disposition of tho sovorign rights
in such waters and lands to the con
trol of the States, respectively, when
admitted into the Union.
This decision leaves the beach miners
at Nome and vicinity in the same posi
tion thoy now hold. They can work
the claims only so long as they are in
actual occupation. So far there has
been a general agreement among the
miners which seems to have worked
very well; especially as the gold-bear
ing sands are of small depth and it does
not take long to work out a claim. It
is easy to see, however, that dissen
sions and serious trouble might ariso
over the possession of a claim.
The decision will also prevent tho
holding of any large section of the
beach by a company, and will very
probably prevent the use of machinery
for working on a largo scale, since
there will be hesitation about spending
large sums for machinery when tho
possession of a large territory is doubt
ful. It will probably leave tho beach
mines open to individual prospectors
and miners, as now.
Of course an appeal may bo taken
from the Commissioner's decisions,
but it seems to be founded on law, and
will probably stand unless Congress
should take some special action in the
matter. — Engineering and Mining

LITIGATION
Litigation —
To the lawyers brings elation,
To the clients consternation,
To the counsel animation,
To the "devil" reputation.
To the usher agitation.
To the jury aggravation,
To the witness indignation,
To the judge consideration,
To the reporters expectation,
To the loser lamentation, -
• . To the winner exultation,
To the public information. — London

POST WANTS IT MORE EXPLICIT
Several scientific papers in New York
are at present engaged in an animated
discussion as to what portion of the
human anatomy nature intended should
be subjected to spanking. The con
troversy loses nearly all interest from
the fact that it is eminently scientific
in the language employed.
TWO ON THE TOURIST.
Tourist— Is there an echo here?
Guido— You just call out "Two pots
of boor."
Tourist (doos so)— I don't hear any
thing-.
Guide (pointing to a waiter who ap
pears on tho scene)— No, but here comes
the beer.
THE ONLY "PEBBLE"
Tourist— What's the name of that
noblo mountain?
Native— Dunno as it's got any; we
call it "the mountain."
Tourist — No name for that grand
eminence?
Native— Wot's the use of it's havin'
a name? It's the only mountain here.
SOMETHING WORTH KNOWING.
Book Agent— If you'll buy this book,
sir, I'll guarantees that you'll learn one
thing that will savo you lots of money.
.Man of the House— I'll take it.
What will it teach me?
"Never to buy another book from a
book agent. "—Harlem Life.

is shown by the following letter from Mr. N.
H. Andrews, a prominent resident of Spring-
field, Ohio, who writes :— .
" W. II. Hooker <£• Co., New York :
"Gentlemen. affords me a great pleasure
to assure you that I have received both im-
mediate and permanent relief from throat,
bronchial and asthmatic troubles by using
Acker's English Remedy, taken strictly ac-
cording to directions. It is a blessing to
