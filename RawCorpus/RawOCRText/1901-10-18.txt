Apple Pie Order.
To feel in apple pie order is a phrase
which dates back to Puritan times— to
a certain Qepzibah Morton. It seems
that every Saturday she was accus
tomed to bake two or three dozen ap
ple pies, which were to last her family
through the coming week. These she
placed carefully on her pautry shelves,
labeled for each day of the week, so
that Tuesday's pies might not be con
fused with Thursday's nor those pre
sumably large or intended for washing
and sweeping days eaten when house
bold labors were lighter. Aunt Hep
zlbah's "apple pie order" was known
throughout the entire settlement and
«rlginated the well known saying.

SAVAGES IN JAPAN.
THE HAIRY AINOS AND THEIR RESER-
VATIONS IN THE EMPIRE.
Oild Custom* Practiced by The**
Aboriginal People - of Japan.
I'nlqne Styles In Baby Sunn.
Their Reaemblance to Oar Indiana.
The Ainus, generally known to Amer
icans and Europeans as "the hairy
Amos," are the only aboriginal people
now living In Japan. They are called
•'hairy" .In contradistinction to the
smooth faced Japanese, Koreans and
Chinese. Their present home Is In Hok
kßido, or Yesso, the most northerly part
of the empire, although It Is supposed
that in earlier times they occupied
most of the entire country. Ancestors
sf the Japanese of today found them in
possession and by force of superior
arms and civilization gradually drove
them to the north, much in the same
way as the savages were driven back
toward the Pacific by Ihe early settlers
in America. .
The Ainus live today pretty much as
the Indians on their reservations In the
west They are still for the most part
half savage, and the Japanese name'
for them, "Yesso," means barbarian.
They are-very skillful in hunting and
fishing, which are their chief occupa
tions. They are under the. protection
of the imperial government and are
entirely separated from the Japanese.
The latest census showed that they,
number very nearly 17,000/ Z<^-
Among tbe many curiou§-« lS toms of
the Ainus peihapstho-4iifi>ntest is their
method of ngjv«g«ieir children. They
obseryp^t'Tieculiar economy in giving
, v » I nes. The Infant must go without a
name until it shows itself worthy of
bearing one. If it is sickly and not
likely to live, it is not considered worth
while to waste a name upon It. As
each child must by immemorial custom
have a brand new name. ' used by no
oue in the community, names are scarce
aud must be guarded. If the child
should be given a name borne by some
oue else, the ghost of tbe former pos
sessor of the name may come back
from tbe underworld to avenge the
slight : . ,
It is customary to take a name from
some Incident tßat occurred at the
child's birth or it Is left to the parents
afterward to choose one for It Should
the infant come into the world with a
smiling face it might be called Iklshi
maburu, which means a smile, or fond
parents may call it Kamolssage (a
pulling rope of the gods) if they wish
their child to be in the special care of
the gods.
From the age of 7 to 10 Ainu children
of either sex have their heads shaved,
but after 11 they are allowed to have
long hair and wear the same clothes
as grown persons. They wear no cloth
ing unless the weather Is very cold.
The favorite and almost exclusive or
iiameut is the earring, usually made of
metal. What clothing Is worn is made
of straw. They never wear shoes or
other covcring'Tor the feet except as s
great luxury and mark of distinction
on ceremonious occasions.
The men carry small knives and to
bacco pouches, and the women carry
small looking glasses and knives. The
knife Is used as symbolic The maiden
wears it with tbe blade bare, but when
she marries it is worn in a sheath. The
women also paint their faces, using a
kind of ink for the purpose.
The Ainus live mostly by fishing and
hunting. They hunt the bear and deer,
catch salmon and other fish and grow
potatoes and millet Whenever they
can get it they eat rice, which they re
gard as the best food, though they do
not raise It themselves. Both sexes
smoke tobacco and drink liquor. '
The marriage customs differ widely
from those of tbe Japanese. The ques
tion Is first settled between the youth
and maiden, who then refer the matter
to their parents through a mediator,
who should be a relative of the pro
spective bridegroom. The man must
send a present of lacquered ware,
which is regarded by them as one of
the most precious things in the world.
This, however, Is reclaimed by him If
his wife afterward seeks a divorce.
Alnus live In dwellings of about the
same class as those of the American
Indians. The rude hut has two win
dows, one of them for ordinary earthly
uses, the other reserved for the en
trance of the gods.
Woman is fairly treated and held in
deep respect The man is not allowed
to enter the house when tbe woman Is
In it alone, and he Is not permitted to
walk behind a woman. When a man
meets a woman, he must salute first,
by smoothing his beard and rubbing
his hands. Then she responds by
touching her nose' with a finger of her
left hand.
During October the Alnus hold a re
ligious fete, which is called the bear
festival, because they sacrifice a bear
which has been carefully fostered for
three years.
Judicial punishment among tbe Alnus
consists of a severe beating with a
stick administered to the culprit. The
crimes are generally theft— stealing ar
ticles or the wife of a neighbor. As
there are eight men to one woman the
majority of the males are not married,
and jyifje stealing Is very common. The
accused is subjected to a long examina
tion by the chief of the community and
Is then compelled to resort to the ordeal
of lire. He must take a stone out of
boiling water. If Innocent, the Ainus
think he will not be Injured. If tbe
.question cannot be settled In this way,
the principals ip the dispute must fight
itout ' ■ •
1 Tbe Afnus are polytbelsts, though
they limit their gods to two, a god of
fire and a god of water. The first Is
called Kabekamoi and the latter llato
ksmpL They, also, like most peoples
who have a religious system, believe In
some sort of heaven and hell.— Japan

Going; to Canoim.
The saying "going to Canossa" refers
to the ' humiliating pilgrimage made
by the ' Emperor Henry IV to Italy In
the year 1077. Henry had objected to
the claims advanced by Gregory Hllde
brand and, refusing to submit, was ex
communicated by that pontiff. The
emperor at first laughed at the sen
tence, but took a more serious view
when he found himself "deserted even
by his personal attendants and resolved
6n a Journey to Italy to make his peace
with the pope. The latter was then at
the Castle of Canossa, a fortress of the
Countess Mathilda and situated in the
mountains of Modena. Thither the em
peror hastened, but the pope refused
to see him save under the most degrad
ing conditions.
The desperate situation of Henry
compelled him to submit, and for three
flays and nights, barefooted and bare
headed, clad only In a hair shirt, the
raiment of a penitent, he waited at the
gate. At* tbe end of this fearful pen
ance, which was undergone in the
month of January, he was admitted to
the piipal presence, was absolved and
received his dominion as a gift from
the pope. The expression has ever
since- been current as Indicative of
abject submission on any terms im
posed by the conqueror.
They Weren't Fed.
"Some years ago.'L-eald a San Fran
cisco man, "a.etfobe trotting English
man came_J»ito the city by the Golden
Gattv-an'd It fell to my lotto entertain
him. So one night I took him to dine
at the far famed Cliff House. It was
a beautiful moonlight night, and from
where we sat upon the porch we look
ed out upon the broad bosom of the
Pacific ocean. The moon's light made
a path across the waters, and in Its
center the Seal rocks lay like a black
patch. The Englishman inquired what
they were and upon my informing him
said: 'Bah Jove, are those the Seal
rocks of which I have heard? I'd very
much like to see the seals. I say, my
man,' turning to the waiter, 'caun't I
see the seals? Don't you feed them at
night?'
" 'Oh, yessir,' replied the waiter, who
was of Hibernian descent, without
blinking an eye. 'At 9 o'clock we al
ways gives them their ham and eggs,
sir.'
"The Englishman accepted this sur
prising piece of Information without
turning a hair and announced that he
would surely be on hand at the time
mentioned. He was; but, needless to
say, the waiter was not."
Knocked. Her Oat With a Look.
While talking of the many notable
people he met during his pugilistic ca
reer John L. Sullivan said one day In
New York: "Once when I was In Syd
ney I had a suit of rooms directly over
Sarah Bernbardt I never met the
lady, and I didn't much care. She was
Jabbering French all the time and was
rehearsing constantly in her room. 1
heard so much of It that I pretty near
had the willies. Oue uight 1 happened
to follow Sarah Into her majesty's thea
ter In Sydney, and I had a good chance
to size her up. She was a feather
weight all right, and there was so much
powder on her face that I thought she'd
made a mistake. She got a look at me,
and because I had been so much annoy
ed with her jabbering I scowled at her
—gave her the look that used to scare
the dubs who tried to stay four rounds
with me. Well, sir, Sarah gave one
long, mournful howl and fainted away.
After that she didn't jabber any more,
for she'd found out who was living up
stairs."
Not Clipped.
A naturalist says that the squirrel
tribe Is increasing all over the wooded
districts of England and in the Scottish
lowlands. In some parts of Scotland,
notably In the north, the little creature
is unknown.
It is not so long ago that a Scotch
Judge was trying a case which had to
do with the escape of a squirrel from
Its cage and the question as to whether
It bad been stolen.
"Were Its wings clipped?" he asked a
witness.
"But, my lord," Interposed the coun
sel, ''it Is a quadruped/
"Quadruped or no quadruped," said
his honor sternly, "if its wings had
been clipped It could never have es
caped."
Vat of a liOns Breath.
When chilled by exposure to cold,
take a long breath, with the mouth
firmly shut Repeat this several .times
until you begin to feel the heat return-
Ing. It requires only a very short time
to do this. The long breath quickens
the pulse, and this causes the blood to
circulate faster. The blood flows into
all parts of the veins and arteries and
gives out a great deal of heat It is
stated that a long, deep breath, held as
long as possible, will close tbe pores of
a heated skin, and the danger of taking
cold, on stepping outdoors, may be thus
guarded against.
Drop* of Ink,
"A drop of Ink may make a million
think," quoted McSwilllgen.
"So I have heard," added Squlldig.
"It may provoke language too. A few
drops of Ink that I inadvertently drop
ped on my wife's new carpet brought
forth about a million 'words, and all
energetic words too."
Boiled Clotheslines.
When I buy a new clothesline, I boil
It for half an hour before putting It up.
This toughens it, makes It last much
longer, and It does not snarl when put

Grazed In (he Fogr.
It Is not usual for a ship on the high
seas to elect to cast anchor on the deck
of a passing steamer, but that Is what
a four roasted^ schooner did once In tho
Atlantic. The two vessels grazed in
the fog, and tho "catted" port anchor
of the schooner caught iv the steamer's
deck "by a flukes" It fastened to an

as to bar his exit; but, fortunately, the

Cleaning the Crock.
A farmer has an ambitious son, 12
years old, who, being left alono for a
few hours the other day, tried to clean
the clock. He easily got the clock to
pieces, but his difficulty lay in putting
them together again altar cleaning.
At this task he was only partly suc

Stevenson's Cop of Misery.
R. I* Stevenson, writing in 1593 to
George Meredith, in an epistle quoted
In a new edition of his "Letters." says,
with heart touching pathos:
"For 14 years I have not had a day's
real health. I have wakened sick and
gone to bed weary, and I have done my
work unflinchingly. I have written in
bed and written out of It, written In
hemorrhages, written in sickness, writ
ton torn by coughing, written when my
head swam for weakness, and for so
long, It seems to me, I have won my
wager and recovered my glove. I am
better now— have been, rightly speak
ing, since first I came to the Pacific—
and still few are the days when I am
not In some physical distress. And the
battle goes on— ill or well is a trifle so
that it goes. I was made for a contest
aud the powers have so willed that my
battlefield should be this dingy, inglori
ous one of the bed and the physic bot
tle. At least I have not failed, but I
would have preferred a place of trum
petings and the open air over my
head."
The Life Ltne In One'a Band.
There are three prominent lines In
the palm— the line of life, that of the
bead and the heart line.
The line of life begins on the inner
boundary of the palm, about midway
between the thumb and the forefinger.
If we Imagine the left hand to be a
map, with the fingers pointing north,
this Hue runs toward the southeast
then curves toward the south and In
some hands curves finally toward the
southwest It thus skirts the base or
"uprise" of the thumb, known as the
uprise of Venus. If It is deep, broad,
of good color and extends nearly or
quite to the wrist and If the rest of the
haud indicates vitality and cheerful
ness, the subject maybe expected to live
to a green old age; he has a good dispo
sition and the qualities which good
health and good temper usually create.
Crane Island.
In Lake Minnetonfc*. «Jv«*^l)ta, there
is a picturesque island which takes its
name from the fact that it is unin
habited by man and given over to the
cranes. Generations back these birds
decided upon this spot for a summer
resort. As times went on and the sur
rounding islnuds populated no man
burl the heart to disturb them, until
now Crane island Is pointed out from

Shave* and Colds.
It Is not generally known among men
tbat close shaving is apt to bring on a
cold. Barbers, however, are acquaint

account of it tjian through any desire
to bring their patrons back soon again
that they do not, unless ordered to, ad-,

A WORTHY SUCCESSOR.
"Something Hew Under The Snn."
All Doctors have tried to cure
Catarrh by tho use of powders, acid
gases, inhalers and drugs in paste form.
Their powders dry up the mucuous
membranes. causing them to crack open
and bleed. The powerful acids used in
the inhalers have entirely eaten away
the same membranes that their makers
have aimed to cure, while pastes and
ointments cannot reach tne disease.
An old and experienced practitioner
who has for many years made a close
study and specialty of the treatment of
Catarrh, has at last perfected a treat
ment which, when faithfully used, not
only relieves at once, but permanently
cures Catarrh, by removing the cause,
.stopping the discharges, and curing all
inflammation. It is the only remedy
known to science that actually reaches'
the afflicted parts. "This wonderful
remedy is known as "Snuffles the
Guaranteed Catarrh Cure," and is sold
at the extremely low price of one dol
lar, each package containing internal
and external medicine sufficient for a
full month's treatment and everything
necessary to its perfect use.
"Snuffles" is the only perfect
Catarrh cure ever made and is now
recognized as the only safe and positive
cure for that annoying and disgusting
disease, It cures all inflammation
quickly and permanently and is also
wonderfully quick to relieve hay fevor
or cold in tho head.
Catarrh, when neglected, often leads
to consumption — "Snuffles" will gave
you if you use it at onco. It is an ordi
nary remedy, but a- complete treat
ment which fa positively guaranteed to

Chinese Landlords Must Cultivate or

As among the oldest living nations
China has the right to claim paternity
for a few important modern ideas at
least, and, strangely enough, an ap
proach to of the theories of Henry
George on the land question is among
them. There no land is permitted to
be idle or unproductive. If a landlord
allows his ground to go out of cultiva
tion or attempts to hold it for a rise in
price, he is told to do otherwise.
Should he fail to comply it is taken
from him and managed and owned by.
the stato. Moreover, the soil is
equitably divided among the people.
Each family is said to have its patrimo
nial field that has been its inheritance
for ages. The largest farms, as a rule,
are not more than thirty acres, and.
throughout the whole empire there are
few landholders who own more than
fifty acres. Most of the farms, or lots,
are from three to nine aevos in extent.
These family farms, can never be sold
out of the lino of succession so long as
one of the blood wants to buy them.
All land Is taxed at a rate varying ac

THAT EMERGENCY BRIDGE.
It is a matter for regret that the su
pervisors have s-een fit to let the con
tract for the bridge at Carbondale
without first calling for bids, and
especially so under the flimsy excuse
of being a case of great emergency.
The truth is, the plain, provision of
the law requiring work of that char
acter to be subjected to open com
petition, after public advertisement
for proposals, has been brushed
aside without scruples, and a pre
ferred contractor selected to do the
work, without any effort, so far as
we know, to ascertain whether the
price charged, or the plans and
specifications submitted, were fair
and reasonable. Is this method of
bridge building to be taken as a
precedent? Whenever a bridge
needs reconstruction, all that the
supervisors have to do hereafter is
to pass a resolution that the re
building of the worn out structure is
a case of great emergency, and that
the necessities of traffic do not ad
mit of the matter taking the usual
course of calling for bids, and there
upon they are invested with all
legal authority to proceed according
to their own preferences, and let the
contract to whomsoever they may
select, and at the contractor's
own price. The supervisors are
absolutely the masters of the situa
tion, according to this novel and
strained construction of the law.
The point is so important that we
trust some citizen will file a protest
with the clerk or treasurer against
the payment of the contract price
of the bridge, the contract for which
has been let, in our judgment, in
open defiance of the law. If our
laws, framed for the purpose of
guarding against favoritism in the
letting of public contracts, and to
protect the taxpayers from ex
travagance, can be evaded by a
simple resolution passed by the
board, it is time the people under
stood it, and the courts were called
upon to clearly define the law on
this proposition. We do not believe
the statutes are such a rope of sand
on a proposition so vitaljy -affecting
the public welfare, as the ! action :of
the supervisors indicates.
THE NEW CODES INVALID.
California is having a hard time in
its endeavor to recodify its laws.
Up to 1873 we had no codes. The
laws of the state were embraced in
the statutes passed at the various
sessions of the legislature. In 1873,
Creed Haymond, John C. Burch and
C. Lindley were appointed code
commissioners, and without much
ado or expense wrote our present
codes, which we're adopted by the
legislature. -In 1895 Governor Budd
appointed Messrs. Wallace, Baldwin
and another to revise the codes.
This commission served two years,
drew $24,000 for their services, $16,
000 for expenses, and accomplished
nothing. Two years later, Messrs.
Bulla, Caminetti and Shanahan were
appointed. They served two years
at a like expense, but failed to get
the legislature to adopt their work.
In 1899 Governor Gage appointed
Messrs. Van Fleet, Freeman and
Dennis. They wrote a' set of code
amendments, which were adopted
by the legislature, but which have
been declared invalid by the supreme
court. The point upon which the
court has knocked out the new codes
is that the legislature in passing the
amendments failed to comply with
section 24 of the constitution, which
provides that "no law shall be re
vised or amended by reference to its
title, but in such case the act re
vised or section amended shall be
reenacted and published at length
as revised or amended." The law
makers bumped up against this
plain constitutional requirement,
and hence the result. It is a mis
take to say that the entire work of
the commissioners has been rendered
abortive by this decision. If the
commissioners have done their work
wisely and well in revising and re
arranging the codes, their work can
be.utilized by the next legislature in
passing an act in conformity with
the constitution and the supreme
court's interpretation. It delays the
adoption of the amendments, but
does not wipe out the labors of the
commissioners.
The decision is far reaching. One
of the changes attempted -to be
made related to the : publication of
notice to creditors in probate cases.
Claims had to be presented to the
clerk of the court instead of the ad
ministrator. It is now probable
that new publications will have to
be made in all estates where the new
codes were followed. The laws re
lating ■to ■ the disqualification of
judges, making it a felony for a
notary to indorse an acknowledg
ment or oath on a document in the
absence of the party executing the
same, and authorizing police judges
to solemnize marriages, all fall to
the ground.

THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSOfr, uALTFOKKIA* FKIPAY, OCTOBER 18. 1901.
Mmder and Retribution
The Garduerville Record of Douglas
county, Nevada, gives the following ac
count .of the latest escapade of the
famous Indian outlaw:
Joe Pete, who was sentenced to be
banged for the murder of young Will
Dangberg, has added another victim to
his list of crimes, this timo, his own
father-in- law, who has harbored him
for the past year.
Pote entered the camp of old Monitor
George, near Woodford's, last Sunday
night, and asked for his mahala. The
old man promptly ordered him away.
Pete raised his Winchester rifle and
shot the old man, causing almost in
stant death. The old mahala, in at
tempting to interfere, was battered
over the head" with tho stock of* tho
rifle, and left for dead. •'V
Consternation struck the Indians in
and about Woodford's, who hurried to
the stores for firearms and ammunition.
It is thought that the fugitive will now
be captured or killed, as tho Indians
aro afraid to harbor the murderous
outlaw any longer.
As a result of his last . murder, the
Indians held a consultation, and Pete's
own brother was choson to mete out
punishment to tin- man. Tuesday he
found his man in hfc hiding place iv
Alpine county, and shot him to death.

Mountain Climbers.
Last Saturday morning a party of
girls went for a walk to the top of
Butte mountain. Contrary to the pre
diction of parents and friends they
reached the top, where a dainty lunch
was thoroughly enjoyed. Some time
was spent in viewing the scenery, find
ing strange geological .formations, and
gathering the early red berries. The
party rested at the Ruffner home, and
enjoyed their hospitality for a short
timo. Of course the girls saw . tho
usual snakes, ants, spiders, etc. As a
result of this tramp a J. G. club has
boon organized by tho girls. The
members are Miss Morrow, Eva Leak,
Agnes Dwyer, Eloise Freeman, Olivo
Gordon, Agnos Grimshaw, Vivian
Kent,- Oral Angove, Susan Laughton,
Emily Angove and Maud Fortner.

Another Snake Story.
In its latest issue the Calavoras
Chronicle tells about a "snake in a
cart wheel." Tho writer of that
journal says:
Mrs. A. F. Gourley of Pino Grovo,
while on her way to Valley Springs in
a cart, heard the rattle of a snake.
The horse was walking slowly, and
while she could toll from the sound
that the snake was close, sho was un
able to locate it until she glanced at
one of the cart wheels, and there she
saw wriggling among the spokes, near
tho hub, a huge rattler fully four feet
in length. Sho struck tho horse,
and tho rapid revolution of the wheel
threw tho reptile off. The wheel had
probably passed over it and it coiled
around the spokes and was no doubt
carried around many times before it
was noticed by Mrs. Gourloy.
A Fiendish Attack.
An attack was lately made on C. F.
Collier of Cherokee, lowa, that nearly
proved fatal. It came through his kid
neys. His back got so lame ho could
not stoop without great pain, nor sit in
a chair except propped by cushions.
No remedy helped him until he tried
Electric Bitters which effected such a
wonderful change that he writes he
feelslike a new man. This marvelous
medicinq. cures backache and kidney
trouble, purifies the blood and builds
up your health. Only 50c at Spagnoli's
Drug Store.

A BIG MINING CASE
Suit Involving the Rich Ledge of the
Central Eureka.
Central Eureka Mining Company vs. East
Central Eureka.
The important mining suit of Central
Eureka Mining Company vs. . East
Central Eureka was commenced in the
superior court last Monday morning.
The importance of the suit, judged
from the interests involved, which
amount to no less than the ownership
of the remarkably rich ore body en
countered in the Central Eureka mine,
on the summit of Sutter hill, has
naturally drawn a number of promi
netit outside attorneys into the case.
On the side of the plaintiff corpora
tion, there appeared Warren Olney,
C. H. Lindley and W. J. McGee; and
for the defendants, A. E. Bolton, of
the firm of Galpin and Bolton, and
Judge C. W. Slack, both or San Fran
cisco. Two shorthand reporters, one
for each side, are taking the testimony.
Besides the attorneys, the principal
officers of the company are attending
the trial, among them being E. B. De
Golia, president; W. A. Van Bokkelen,
secretary; J. H. Grady, director, J Van
Horn and Chas. Wagner, stockholders.
For the defense there were present,
Jas. Toman and C. W. Randall.
The object of the suit is to quiet title
to that portion of the Central Eureka
ledge which runs under the surface
boundaries of the agricultural claim of
James Toman. The Central Eureka
commenced operations, as far as the
present company is concerned, about
six years ago. An old shaft had been
sunk to the depth of 700 feel, en
countering little or no pay ore. The
present company continued this^pkaf I
down, and at the depth ot^-tOoO feet
pay ore came in, and-^ofif that point
to the bottopv-<^the shaft, which is
2000f»» <rtf eep, the pay shoot continues.
trrllts have been run north and south
at various depths following the vein,
but these had all been filled up with
waste to the 1060 level; below that
point they were open. The company
bonded the Toman ranch, which lies to
the east of the mining claim, and run
crosscuts at various points to prospect
for new ore bodies. AH these, how
ever, proved fruitless; the rock en
countered was hard greenstone, and
the company allowed the bond to be
forfeited, the ground being considered
of no value for mining purposes. From
the 1060 to the 1850 level in the 6haf t,
the gouge was found on the hanging
wall, instead of the foot wall. But
from tho top clear to the bottom of the
shaft, the testimony of W. R. Thomas
and the surveyor, W. E. Downs,
showed the fissure was clearly defined —
with smooth hanging wall and gouge,
indicating one continuous vein.
Tho contention of the defendant is
that the ore body, not only extends in
its eastern pitch into the Toman
ground, but also that its outcrop is
within tho agricultural- land. Of
course, if this is correct, the ore body
is part and parcel of the Toman ranch.
If on the other hand,'' the ledjre out
crops within the boundaries of the
Contra! Eureka mining patent, and
the ledge is found to be continuous,
the mining prftent would hold it, no
matter how far it extends in its eastern
pitch beyond the surface boundaries of
the mining claim, and into the agri
cultural ground claimed by Toman.
The suit is therefore instituted to en
join the defendant from setting up any
claim to any portion of the Central
Eureka ledge. This ore shoot is the
richest for its size to be found in the
county. The company is paying
regular monthly dividends, and the
outlook for the property is very
promising.
Nearly all the experienced mining
men of Amador county were called as
witnesses for the plaintiff, and testified
from actual examination of the condi
tions found in the Central Eureka
shaft, and the various drifts and
crosscuts. Among the witnesses be
sides the superintendent, W. R.
Thomas, were John Truscott, J. F.
Parks, John B. Tregloan, and W. F.
Detert. All were yery decided in ex
pressing their opinion of the unity of
tho Ceutral Eureka vein, and Its
identity with the regular mother lode.
The remarkable smoothness of the
hanging wall and the regularity of its
pitch eastward was also a noticeable
featuroof the mine. The regularity
of pitch enabled them to secure a good
working shaft by following the vein
from tpp to bottom. One noticeable
feature brought out upon cross-exami
nation was that between the 1060 level
and the 1240 level the hanging wall of
the shaft was formed by quartz which
had not been blasted out in process of
sinking. At the 1060 station this
quartz was 18 inches thick at the roof
and tapering to nothing a few feet
above. The weight of the cross-exami
nation seemed to be to establish the
probability, from these left patches of
quartz on the east or banging wall of
the shaft, commencing as they did at
the point where pay rock was first met,
that this vein of ore entered the shaft
at this promt from the east, and that
two ore bodies i#et at this point, the
one from the east constituting the rjcb
ledge of tho Central Eureka. All the
plaintiff's witnesses stoutly disputed
this theory, and contended that the
oneness of the vein was as fully dem
onstrated by theconditionsjin the shaft
and drifts as though those adhering
masses of quartz were blasted from the
shaft, revealing the smooth hanging
wall from top to bottom.
Tho plaintiff's case was closed Thurs
day afternoon. Tho defense moved for
a nonsuit, which was denied. - .■ujj
The defendant offered in evidence a
deed from the Central Eureka Com
pany to James Toman and wife, which
purported to convey a certain triangu
lar piece pf land lying east of the Cen
tral Eureka" niiriing grpupd,. It was
apparently intended to convey the sur
face right to a strip of land along the
eastern boundary of the mine. The
contention of the defense seems to be
t;>at inasmuch as the deed makes no
reservation, It parries not only the sur
face, but also everything beneath the
surface! which' would Include the eu
tire pay ore shoot. Counsel for plain
tilt strenuously objected to the intro
duction of this deed, claiming that by
its terms it conveyed no portion of the
mining ground, surface or otherwise.
The case is still on. trial.

Mining Notes.
Dooley.— A pocket containing $800
was taken from this mine last week by
the owners, the Dooley boys. The
mine is on the old Kinne place on the
lone road. .:";
Central Eureka.— This property
has paid monthly dividends regularly
for the past eight months, including
October. There are 400,000 shares in
the company. Six dividends were paid
at the rate of 2J cents per share, ag
gregating $60,000, and two dividends at
the rate of 2 cents per share, aggregat
ing $16,000, making a total of $76,000.
The shaft is down to, a depth of 2000
feet, and the mine opened to tho 1860
level, from which ore is now being sup
plied to the mill. The company gives
employment to 80 men. The mine is
in excellent shape under the able euper
intendency of W. R. Thomas, who has
had charge of the mine since the
present company started operations.
Mitchell. — At this mine, situated
one mile north of Pine Grove, the ten
stamp mill is kept running steadily on
good ore. The mine is looking better
than it ever did. A new ore body has
been opened on the 200 foot level, from
which tho mill is being supplied. The
ore is reported to be of better grade
than ever. The success of the Mit
chell ought to encourage the develop
ment of other mines in that vicinity.
There are many ledges around Pine
Grove which are deserving of con
sideration. Several of them have been
bonded for one year, among them be
ing the Tellurium and Reward. The
parties having the bond have held out
hopes of starting development work
several times, but live or six months
have elapsed, and nothing whatever
has been done.
Wildman. — Work was resumed at
this mine early this week. Spokane
capitalists, who are also largely inter
ested in mining operations in Idaho,
have taken hold of the property. It
is the intention to explore tho mine to
a greater depth, and if possible keep
the mill running at the same time.
Bunker Hill.— The shaft has reached
a depth of 1300 feet. The drifts at the
800 foot level have encountered small
patches of ore.
Gover.— The drift from the 600 foot
level of the Fremont has been run into
the Gover ground, and developed an
ore body 110 feet wide. It is a low
grade proposition, as might be expected
from a ledgo of that size. Still it is
claimed to bo milling rock, some esti
mating it at between $4 and $5 per ton.
It is reported that a 60-stamp mill will
be erected in tho spring. This discov
ery drill no doubt impart a new stimu
lus to the mining industry in the nor
thern part of the county.

A Bad Accident.
Last Friday afternoon while the
stage— an extra— driven by Cleve Jones,
an employe of Muldoon's livery stable
at lone, was rounding the curve near
the foot of the grade just beyond the
Copper mine, on the lone road, a bolt
that fastened one side of the pole to
the axle, broke, and let that side of the
pole drop to the ground, causing the
stage to swing around and turn com
pletely over on its side. There were
five passengers aboard, and among
them was -our townsman, William
Tarn, who was quite painfully injured.
In some way Mr. Tarn's left foot and
lower part of his leg was caught, and
one of the small bones of tho ankle
was broken. It is yery painful, but
not at all serious, and under the skill
ful treatment of Dr. Lonigo he is doing
as well as could be expected. Fredrick
Puteke, a German, was another of the
passengers that was seriously hurt in
the knee. 'He was .brought to the
Central hotel by the stage people, and
later he was sent to San Francisco for
hospital treatment. We understand
that Puteke was settled with by the
stage owner. ' :
Habeas Corpus Case.
A writ of habeas corpus was issued
out of the superior court early this
week, commanding Mrs. May V. Good
man, to have the body of Naomi Maud
Goodman, a child of four years, who
the writ alleged was being illegally re
strained of her liberty, before the su
perior court on October 14. It seems
that the mother of the child, the
divorced wife of Dr. Goodman, of Sut
ter Creek, appeared in our sister town
late last week, for the purpose of giv
ing the father an opportunity of seeing
his child prior to the departure of the
mother and child on a visit to Indiana.
The doctor considered that tho trip to
Indiana ut this season of the year
would be injurious to the child's health,
and hence employed D. L. Donnelly' to
commence habeas corpus proceedings
to enjoin the mother from taking the
child there. The writ was heard last
Monday, and the court dismissed the
same, thereby permitting the child to
accompany its mother on her long«trip,
but at the same time requiring that
the absence of the child from the state
should not occupy over three months.
C. M. Phelps, Forestdale, Vt., says
his child was completely cured of a bad
case of eczema by the use of De Witt's
Witch Hazel Salve. Beware of all
counterfeits. It instantly relieves piles.

The New Train Service.
There is a rumor current to the
effect that there is some opposition to
the new schedule and extra train re
cently inaugurated on the Amador
Branch railroad between lone and
Gait. The old combination train that
formerly carried passengers and freight
has been changed to afternoon, leav
ing lone about 3:30, and returning to
lone same evening. Passengers ac
commodation is provided either way
on this train, but of course it is the
slow service. The morning train, how
ever, is for passengers exclusively, and
leaves lone 40 minutes later, and re
turns to that town 30 minutes earlier
than formerly. I It goes through with
out the long stoppages 'that usually
occurred under the old time table.
The new arrangement has proved a
great convenience to the traveling
public. It may entail additional labor,
and also some extra expense upon the
corporation, but it is unquestionably a
decided . boon ito passengers, j It is
hoped that the present arrangement
will be continued ..indefinitely, as the
benefits to the many far outweigh the
slight inconvenience to the few. The
efforts of the railroad company to meet'
the wishes of their patrons, as
exemplified in this double service, are
thoroughly appreciated. .

BIG PRICES FOR ANIMALS.
A. Small SUed Fortune Needed to

Because of the difficulty of getting It
to America and of keeping it alive aft
er it arrives a good giraffe Is quoted at
$7,000. -.•;.
Next to the giraffe in the aristocracy
of cost come the rhinoceros and the
hippopotamus, worth from $4,000 to
fcJ.WO each. If a dealer could breed
these animals, he could get rich, but
the big. mammals rarely breed in cap
tivity. About the only place in America
where hippopotami have been known
to raise their young is in the menag
erie in Central park. New York.
A chimpanzee of size is worth $5,000,
and when one reaches the intelligence
of the late Mr. Crowley, Chico or Jo
hanua lie Is beyond a fixed price. The
monkey kind are most uncertain prop
erty. The animal man says they are
certain to die. But the ordinary ones
can be bought very cheaply.
One '.:-'\ buy a nice young baby ele
phant for Jjii.tOO at times,' but a really
good animal is worth from $t,SOO to
?3,000. An elephant does not command
the maximum price t because of the
beauty of his countenance, the ele
gance of his figure, his Intellectual en
dowments or his size, but because of
a si£Sit r sunny disposition. A mean
elephant is about the most evil of liv
ing things. Sooner or later he has to
be . killed, usually after he has slain
Jwo or three keepers and done more
ilamage than he is worth. Of two ani
mals of equally good disposition the
larger and finer commands the higher
price, of course, but the most magnifi

THE HOME GOLD CURE.
An Ingenious Treatment by which Drunk
ards are Being Cured Daily in
Spite of Themselves. :
No Noxious Doses- No Weakening of the
Nerves. A Pleasant and Positive Care
for the Liquor Habit. •
It is now generally known and under
stood that drunkenness is a disease and
not a weakness. A body filled with
poison, and nerves completely shatter
ed by periodical or constant use of in
toxicating liquors, requires an antidote
capable of neutralizing and eradicating
this, poison, and destroying the craving
for intoxicants. Sufferers may now
cure themselves at home without Dub
licity or loss of time from business by
this wondorful "HOME GOLD CURE,"
which has been perfected after many
years of close study and treatment of
inebriates. The faithful use according
to directions of this wonderful dis
covery, is positively guaranteod to cure
the most obstinate case, no matter
how hard a drinker. Our recordsshow
the marvelous transformation of thou
sands of drunkards into sober, industri
ous and upright men.
Wives cure your 'husbands! !
Children cure your fathers! !
This remedy is in no sense a nostrum
but is a specific for this disease only,
and is so skillfully devised and pre
pared that it is thoroughly soluble and
pleasant to the taste, so that it can be
given in a cup of tea or coffee without
the knowledge of the person taking it.
Thousands of drunkards have cured
themselves with this priceless remedy,
and as many more have been cured and
made temperate men by having the
"Cure" administered by loving friends
and relatives without their knowledge,
in coffee or tea, and believe to-day that
they discontinued drinking of their own
free will. Do not wait. Do not be
deluded by apparent and misleading
"improvement." Drive out the disease
at once and for all time. The "Home
Gold Cure" is sold at the extremely
low price of One Dollar, thus placing
within reach of everybody a treatment
more effectual than others costing $25
or $50. Full directions accompany
each package. Special ad vice by skill
ed physicians when requested, without
extra charge. Sent prepaid to any
part of the world on receipt of One
Dollar. Add ress Dopt. E 174, Edwin

--GRANT'S RETREAT.
The General- went When a Police,
man'a Clnb l'oii, V(1 tne Way .
Speaking of nightstlcks-*»« u juds me
of seeing General Grant in nis^io..,^
mind greatest hour, the only time lie~
was ever beaten, and by a policeman.
I told his son, Fred Grant, of it when
he became a police commissioner in the
nineties, but I do not think he appre
ciated It. He was not cast In his great
father's mold. The occasion 1 refer to
was after the general's second term in
the presidency. He was staying at the
Fifth Avenue hotel, when one morning
the Masonic temple was burned. The
fire line was drawn half way down the
block toward Fifth avenue, but the po
lice were much hampered by the crowd
nnd were out of patience when I, stand
ing by, saw a man in a great ulster
with head buried deep In the collar, a
cigar sticking straight out, coming
down the street from the hotel. 1
recognized him at sight as General
Grant. The policeman who blocked
his way did not. He grabbed him by
the collar, swung him about and, hit
ting him a resounding whack across
the back with his club, yelled out:
"What's the matter with you? Don't
you sec the fire lines? Chase yourself
out of here and be quick about it."
The general never said a word. He
did not stop to argue the matter. He
had run up against a sentinel and when
stopped went the other way. That was
all. The man had a right to be there;
he had none. I was never so much an
admirer of Grant as since that day. It
was true greatness. A smaller man
would have made a row, stood upon his
dignity and demanded the punishment
of the policeman. As for him, there
was probably never so badly frighten
ed a policeman when I told him whom
he had clubbed. I will waraut he did
not sleep for a week, fearing all kinds
of things. No need of It Grant prob
ably never gave him a thought— Jacob

HIS START IN LIFE.
"DOC HARTMAN AND HIS WONDER-
FUL GREASE ERADICATOR.
With Soap Candles and Bottles of
Rainwater He Fooled the Public
and Laid the Foundations of a.
Substantial Fortune.
"Talk about your self made men,"
B«id an old timer among a party of
horsemen gathered in one of the speed
way Inns, "I don't think any of 'em
can equal the early experiences of Tim
Ilartman, who died in St Louis many
years ago, leaving nearly a million dol
lars to be fought over by his heirs. lie
made his first good sized pile on pat
ent medicines, then he picked up a
preat deal more on real estate, and at
last he rounded out with in
Montana copper, but he was known as
'Doc' Hartman to the time of his dL-ath
by his few intimate friends.
"But the story that I'm going to tell,
and the one which he often told him
self, concerns his very earliest experi
ences in the accumulation of money.
Tim Hartman started life with $1. He
kicked around as a barefooted boy—
and a pretty mean one. too — in a little
iowu •In Connecticut until he was IS
rears old, and at that time he had be
come so fresh and so full of wind and
general cussedness that his father one
Jay told him he was no good, never
had been and never would amount to
a picayune. The old gentleman, just
to carry out the bluff, told Tim that he
had a good mind to cut him off with a
dollar and make him earn his own liv
ing. Tim straightened up and called
the bluff. lie told the old man that he
would take the dollar and get out then
and there and hustle for himself. Tho
old man handed him a crisp $1 bill and
told him that he'd be glad to see him
make a fortune with it.
"The first thing that cuss did was to
go about in a'few back yards that he
knew of and gather together a lot of
empty bottles which were of no use to
anybody. Then, for 10 cents, he bought
a large cake of a kind of white soap
that was then, and still is, on the mar
***-^He melted this soap and, after
borrow^^jn,, ancient pair of candle
molds t roin^ old gra in the ne , h .
borhood. made tv^, beautUul looki
candles of soap. He neAv« lled bis bo £
ties full of choice rainwater. "Itj*.,.^
made for himself one of those little"
three legged tables like the chuck-a
luck and shell "game «en use outside
the circus, and struck out on foot for a
county fair that was being held about
• 40 miles away.
"When he got there, he put up his lit
tle table outside the grounds, where
the crowd was pretty thick, lighted one
of his soap candles and began to extol
the virtues of 'Dr. Hartman's Famous
Grease Eradicator,' contained in the
bottles set before him.
" 'Now, ladies and gentlemen,' he
would shout In a stentorian but plausi
ble vyoice, 'this marvelous liquid, so
harmless that it can be drunk with im
punity by the smallest Infant and yet
so penetrating that it will seek out and
destroy stains and discolorations from
the most refractory substance, was dis
covered by accident by the famous sci
entist, Dr. Ilartman, the eminent schol
ar, while he was wanderius o'er the
wilds of Patagonia. It Is colorless, you
see, as the waters from heaven, and
yet observe the e.ffects of its startling
properties!'
"At this point Tim would reach for
his soap candle and, inverting it, would
smear a lot of the grease over the
sleeve of his coat .
'"Now, every one of you knows, la
dles and gentlemen,' he would continue,
reaching over and uncorking a bottle
of his rainwater, 'that there is nothing
so penetrating and. lneffaceable as the
grease from a candle, and yet it is a
stain that we are all likely to suffer al
most every evening of our lives while
toying with that common article of the
household, the candle. You will ob
serve that my sleeve is smeared with,
the annoying substance. Behold'—
"Here that country bred fakir would
spill a couple of drops of his rainwater
on • the soap and with a rub or two
would produce a beautiful lather. An
other swipe and the soap would have
entirely disappeared from the^sleeve,
leaving not a trace.
. " 'Now, we make this famous eradi
cator In such enormous quantities,' Tim
would continue, 'that In order to Intro
duce it Into every home hi this broad
land we will dispense with It at. the
absurdly low price of 5 cents, a nickel
a bottle. Step right up! Step right
up!'
"Then, when the public was surging
forward to purchase the rainwater,
Tim would pause occasionally to drink
a bottle of it, just to show that it was
absolutely harmless.
"Well, the stuff went like hot cakes.
When Tim's bottles were all exhausted,
he bought more, and when the fair was
over he went to another and another
until he had traveled all over the coun
try. Then, in some way or other, I
don't know how, he got bold of some
old patent medicine, and, being a gen
ius, of course he made a big go of it
So that's the way Tim Ilartman almost
became a millionaire." — New I'ork
Times.

tened to add, "Although you have lau

Eggshell Flowerpots.
Eggshells may be used to advantage
In starting delicate plants for trans
planting. The half shells are filled
with earth and set in a bos also con
taining dampened earth. A hole is
made in the point of the shell to allow
drainage. A single seed is then plant
ed in each shell, which Is easily broken
when transplanting is done without the
slightest disturbance of roots. This
use of eggshells is the discovery of a
French gardener, who claims that they
are vastly superior to the little pots
generally used for the purpose by flor
ists.

THE ISLAND OF TAHITI. 4
It Moj lie nightly Termed the Far*.
dUe of the Pacific
riot mi- an island set in a reef of cor&J
of myriad hu;..--the lagoon of a light
green, outside the white foaming break
ers the vast ocean of intense blue. On
shore are great bunches of coeoanut
palms lifting their plumes in stately
magnificence, then there are lanes of
trees blossoming in red and yellow flow
ers, and nestling in their midst are the
low thatched houses of the natives.
The delightful and healthy climate of
the island brings to maturity all the
products of the tropics, which arc-no
where found in greater fullness - and
perfection than here. The wayfarer la
soothed by the fragrance of sweet
smelling flowers and delighted with the
abundance of oranges, bananas, bread
fruit and coeoanut which give a peren
nial supply of food to the natives. '
Tahiti may be rightly termed the
"paradise of the Pacific" or even the
world, as in no other place Is there bo
much variety of scenery. At every
turn the constant surprises keep the
traveler In a delirium of delight Some
times the sea lies before him, the
waves wreathed in . a foam of white
breaking the silence in a continuous
roar; on the other side the high, steep
mountains in forms of towers, domes
and steeples pierce the clouds. Now
and then a silvery band of water falls
from perpendicular heights to the tur
bulent stream below. Then you pass
under the sheltering shadows of tall
interlacing trees which excel even the
grandeur of our elm. Farther on you
pass through lanes lined with bananas,
mango and groves of cocoanut— Over-

But For All That He Had Traveled

"Have you spent all of your life right

seated on a rail fence whittling in front
of a log aud slab cabin In one of the
back counties of Arkansas.
"Not by a derned sight!" was the
terse reply. "I been hyar. the better

Tbe Giraffe's Timidity.
A giraffe is very timid on hearing
slight sounds, but is indifferent to loud
ones. A writer in The Leisure Hour
says: "Noisy sounds, like a man walk
ing by with hobnail boots, it does not
notice, but a lady^oming in with hard
ly more sound than the rustling of her
dress makes It start, with pricked ears
and eyes distended. We remember
well, after a terrible explosion of gun
powder on a barge on the canal, ask- ■
Ing the keeper of the giraffes of that
day how they had taken it, and he said
he was surprised how very little notice
they took. They, jumped to their feet,
but almost at once lay down again
when they found nothing happened.
"But," he added; "if I were at night
time to creep along that gallery In my
socks they would be so scared that I
believe they would dash themselves to
bits." They fear the lurking foe, and
a bing bang scares them less than a
faint, rustling sound. They are In that
respect very deerlike."

Power Without Heat.
As we watch the world famous plunge
of Niagara we are offered an impres
sive lesson as to the small value in
heat of much motive power. In so far
as the descent is perpendicular, so that
the water leaves the foot of the falls
with comparatively little current, tho
effect of the concussion is simply to
warm the water through but one-sixth
of a degree F. To heat the water as
much as one degree the falls would
have to be 777 feet in height— George*
