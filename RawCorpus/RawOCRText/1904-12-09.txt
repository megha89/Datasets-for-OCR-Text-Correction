BALANCING RESULTS
THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCES AND
THE PROBLEMS OF LIFE.
Good or Evil in Things la Discovered
by Observations of CanHcquencen,
Morals Are Determined by the Con.
sequences of Human Actions.
A reaction is the consequence of an
action; an effect Is the consequence of
a cause; a result is the consequence of
an- antecedent. - It. Is evident that the
words reaction, effect, result and con
sequence express different manifesta
tions of one law, usually called the
law of causation, though it would be,
I believe, more correctly named the
law of consequences.
AYe shall understand more clearly the
interactions in human affairs when we
recognize that the meaning of the
words reaction, effect and result is in
cluded In the word consequence. We
may doubt the importance of reaction
in our affairs, but we shall not doubt
the importance of consequences.
We are compelled to give considera
tion to consequences in the most triv*>l
affairs. One has consequences in view
when lie strikes a match, sets a pot
to boil, plants a seed, pulls a weed,
sharpens a pencil, mends a fence. Shall
I take an umbrella? I balance the
danger of rain against the annoyance
of the umbrella and decide accordingly.
Shall I change my coat? Take another
cup of coffee? Walk or ride? Each
question will be decided in accordance
with my estimate of the balance of re
sults. In considering possible advan
tages or disadvantages, gains or losses,
we are balancing consequences, en
deavoring to anticipate and weigh the
results of our actions.
Regret is usually a reminder of a
neglect or misjudgment of conse
quences, while repentance and reforma
tion indicate a waking up concerning
consequences. Our interest, curiosity,
anxieties, fears, hopes and ambitions
are concentrated upon consequences.
We seek advice when we are doubtful
about consequences. Precepts and ex
amples elucidate consequences. We
work and rest, eat and drink, scheme
and plan, spend and save, for conse
quences. .;,':■
The lesson of consequences which
the individual often learns slowly and
imperfectly the sound business organ
izations acquire, quickly and enforce
by discipline. The salesmen in a suc
cessful store are characterized by tidi
ness, promptness and a desire to please;
the employees of the important rail
roads are not even permitted to an
swer Insult with Insult. The industry
that is Intelligently managed will
avoid misrepresentation and decep
tion, knowing that a reputation for
truth and fairness Is vital to continu
ous success. The shrewdest maxims
of trade are built -upon the observation
pf cpnsequences.
That mind Is the strongest which hag
the clearest judgment of consequences.
The fools are those who know little
about consequences. The child must
be guarded because it is ignorant of
consequences. Wha{ we know of nar
cotics, stimulants, antidotes, hygiene,
surgery, chemistry, agriculture, me
chanics, commerce, culture, we know
through the observation of conse
quences. The best razor, plow, sani
tary system, plan of social betterment,
Is that which produces the best results.
Knowledge, learning and experience
deal wholly with cause and conse
quence. The science of astronomy
seeks to comprehend the heavenly bod
ies and their Influences upon each oth
er. The science of chemistry explains
the consequences of chemical action.
The science of political economy aims
to distinguish and mark the good and
evil results of different systems of Jand
tenure, taxation, trade and finance.
The science of government would de
termine what political system is best
for a people. The science of war seeks
to know what arms,' equipments, forces
and maneuvers will inflict the great
est Injury upon {he enemy with a m.|n
imum of expenditure. The science of
language deals with the utility of
words, pronunciation and forms of ex
pression. And so on through the whole
of human experience knowledge seeks
to distinguish that which has the best
results from that which has inferior
or evil results.
Our ideas of right and wrong are due
to the nature of the responses to hu
man actions. How do we know that
truth is better than falsehood? Be
cause we are better pleased with our
selves when we speak truthfully than
when we He; because truth Is essential
to understanding; because we despise
lying in others; because lying leaSs to
confusion, uncertainty, chaos, enmity
and to other evil consequences. And
so also we have formed a judgment of
loyalty and treachery, cruelty and
kindness, virtue and vice, by their co.n :
sequences.
Our laws, customs and command
ments would not prove to us that truth
1? better than lying if our own experi
ence did not confirm it. The Decalogue
Is effective only so far as nature cor
roborates it.
Our common conceptions of morality
are the results pf the pbservation of
human actions and their consequences
—of cause and effect, of action nnd
reaction. We know that certain ac
tions are right and others wrong, ns
we know that bread Is good nnd straw
bad for food; that light clothing is
more useful in summer than in win
ter; that cleanliness is better than
filthiness; that the way to walk is for
ward, not backward; that mirth is
pleasanter than grief.
As the value of a machine or imple
ment is shown in its working and the
value of a tree by its fruit, so the mer
it or demerit of food, drink, medicine,
acts and thoughts Is determined by
their results, reactions or effects- by
their consequences,— From "Balance:
the Fundamental Verity," by Orlando

ALPINE GUIDES.
The Trouble They Sometimes Bam
With Reckless Climbers.
The Alpine guide frequently risks his
health, strength, even his life, for per
sons who may have been themselves
the cause of the peril . encountered.
The qualities of a first class guide,
saya the author of "Adventures'on th«
Roof of the World," iuclude not only
skill in climbing, but the ability to
form sound conclusions in moments o\
danger. A certain climber tells an an
ecdote which bears on the importance
of the guide's powers of Judgment.
A member of the Alpine club was
ascending a peak in company with an
Oberland guide. Part of their courst
lay over a snow field which sank grad
ually on one side, stiarply ended by a
precipice on tbe other. The two were
walking along not far from the edg€
of this precipice when the. English
man, thinking that an easier path
might be made by going still nearei
the edge, diverged a little from his
companion's track. To his surprise,
the guide Immediately caught hold oi
him and pulled him back with more
vigor than ceremony, well nigh throw
ing him down in the operation. Wrath
ful and not disinclined to return tht
compliment, the Englishman remon
strated. The guide's only answer was
to point to a small crack, apparently
like scores of other cracks in the neve,
which ran for some distance parallel tc
the edge of the precipice.
The traveler was not satisfied, but h€
was too wise a man to argue while a
desired summit was still some distance
above him. On the descent when th«
scene of the morning's Incident waa
reached the guide pointed to the crack,
which had grown perceptibly wider.
"This marks," he said, "the place
where the true snow field ends. I feel
certain that the Ice from here to the
edge is nothing but an unsupported
cornice hanging over the tremendous
precipice below. It might possibly
have borne your weight, though I don't
think It would." Thereupon he struck
the neve on the farther side of the ice
sharply with his ax. A huge mass
immediately broke* away and went
roaring down the cliff.
The traveler was full of amazement
and admiration and thought how there,
on an easy mountain and in smiling
weather, he had been very near to
making himself into an avalanche.
SYMPATHY.
Sympathy is food to a starving heart,
Sympathy is two hearts pulling at
one load.
Sympathy is the staff on which trou
ble leans. '. ■ >
Sympathy Is the cream that rises on
the milk of human kindness.
Sympathy in sorrow's hour is like the
gentle rain to drooping flowers.
Sympathy is the least the rich, may
give, the most the poor pan offer.
Sympathy is the blossom grown from
tbe costly bulb called personal suffer?
Ing. ~" f %
Sympathy Is a well toned instrument
that readily responds to notes of weal
or yfm.
Sympathy is the most powerful hu^
man magnet far attracting and holding
friendship.
Sympathy is perfect forgetfulness of
oneself in true feeling for the unhap
piness of others.
Sympathy is love's healing balm
spread by pity's tender hand on sor
row's heart wound.
Artificial Beauty In Rome.
Personal artifice is at least as old
as' the. Roman empire, for, speaking of
the artificial beauty of a coquette, llar
tiol says: "Gollu, you are but a com
position of falsehood. While you were
living at Rome your bolr was growing
on the banks of the Rhine. At night
when you lay aside your Silken robes
you lay aside your teeth also. Two
thirds of your person are locked up in
boxes for the night. The eyebrows
with which you muke such insinuating
motions are the work of your slaves.
Thus no man can say, 'I love you,' for
you are not what he loves, and no one
loves what you are."
A Lord Bold Into fSlnveo .
Charles Rgade found the hero of his
novel, "The Wandering Heir," in the.
person Qf Lord Altham of Ireland, who
was sold as a "redemptloner" at Phila
delphia In 1728 and who served for
twelve years in effect as a slave to one
or more masters in Lancaster county,
Pa. The young nobleman was recog
nized by two Irishmen who came by
accident to the house where he lived,
and Admiral Vernon afterward took
him back to Ireland. Reade laid the
scene of Lord Altham's servitude in
northern Delaware, but it is pretty well
established that this was an error.
The SnvlMK Light.
We boast our light; but, If we look
not wisely on the sun itself, it smites
us into darkness. The light which we
have gained was given us not to be ev
er staring on, but by It to discover on
ward things, now remote from ajl
knowledge.— Milto.n ;

CAYENNE PEPPER.
Try a Sandvrlch of It if Yon Aio
Troubled With Insomnin.
"Did you ever try a cayenne peppet
sandwich?"
This question was asked a lady to
whom sleepless nights were growing
to be an almost unendurable burden.
■ "Not that, but I have tried about
everything elde," was the discouraged
answer. "I d»n't suppose, however,
that it woulc> do me any more good
than the thousand and one things I
have tried."
• "I .have suggested the remedy to a
great many people similarly afflicted,
and in every instance good results have
followed. I wish you would let me
make you one."
The haggard face of the sleepless
; woman told its own story. * She lan
guidly assented to her friend's request,
with little or no faith in its efficacy,
yet willing, like the proverbial drown
ing man, to "catch at a straw" that
promised any relief.
• A' cracker was forthwith produced
and quite generously buttered. A lib
eral sprinkling of cayenne pepper was
then added, the two halves put togeth
er and the patient requested to par
take of the spicy concoction.
Strange as it may seem, but little
inconvenience was experienced. The
slight smarting sensation in the mouth
was soon over, and no unpleasantness
w*B felt in the stomach. The crackei
was eaten Just before retiring, and
very soon after the patient was sleep
ing peacefully.
The pepper acted as a stimulant to
the stomach, drawing the blood from
the excited brain and inducing a night
of more refreshing sleep than had been
experienced for a long time. The rem
edy was repeated the next night, with
the same result. A cayenne pepper
sandwich is much less harmful than
drugs and when taken in small quan
tities is a good tonic for a weak stom
ach.
Sick headache has also been known
to yield to a cup of hot water to which
have been added a generous pinch of
cayenne pepper and a nip of soda as
big as a pea.— Table Talk.
TRICKS OF THIEVES.
Clever Schemes That Aid In the Per-
petration of Crime.
"Thieves resort to clever methods in
order to get away with the goods," gaid
an old police officer, "and I am firmly
convinced that if the criminals of the
world would devote tbe 6ume amount
of time, talent and patience to think
ing out uplifting and advantageous
schemes for humankind they would
in a short while revolutionize the world
in many useful ways. But somehow
the mind of the criminal seems to
be sharper, if I may say it, ami bright
er and quicker than the mind of the
honest man. The fact maj r be ex
plained in any number of ways. In
the first place, the criminal has noth
ing to do but think out some plan,
of getting something that doesn't be
long to him. That is his special busi
ness. Quite naturally the plan he
works out under those circumstances
will often startle even the oldest men
in the police departments of the coun
try. Who would have thought of the
wire saw, a thing so small that it can
be slipped In between the layers of the
shoe sole, but the criminal who found
in it a ready, convenient and unfailing
means of escape? He Is constantly
thinking up some new scheme. Here
we find a man and woman In a Jewelry
store. The woman carries a parrot with
her. The bird suddenly gets away and
begins to flutter around in the store.
The Jeweler is afraid the parrot* will
break something. He tries to catch it
and succeeds after a short while. A
small purchase Is made. The man and
the woman leave. Result, several hun
dred dollars' worth of Jewelry gone.
It was stolen during the excitement
over the bird. Good scheme, eh ? Yet
it is but one out of a million worked
by the clever degenerates of the
world." — New Orleans Times-Demo
crat
The Spinning Wheel In Ireland.
The spinning wheel and the flax
Wheel are still found in the Irish cot
tages, where many a girl has her wed
ding dowry of linen and homespun
made at home. Although It is more
the task of the older women, there are
still girls who do their spinning stint
and lay by a certain amount for their
wedding outfit. A pleasant sight It is
to see the elderly women outside their
cottage doors spinning the flax or the
wool. As long as the weather Is warm
the sturdy Irishwoman, old or young,
scorns a roof except to sleep under.
The free air and sunshine are her
choice, and the sweet sky is the fairr
pst roof.
Politics and Humor.
In the world of politics the man who
would obtain political preferment must
be serious. No man who cultivates hu
\mor to the exclusion of his other gifts
can hope to attain to the highest places
In the political arena. The American
citizen reserves the inalienable right to
Vote for whom he wills, and the serious
man who suppresses his sense of hu
mor rather than the man who culti
vates it is honored with his preference.

WEEDS
Consumption is a human
weed flourishing best in weak
lungs. Like other weeds it's
easily destroyed while young ;
when old, sometimes im-
possible.
Strengthen the lungs as you
would weak land and th.c
weeds will disappear.
The best lung fertilizer is
Scott's Emulsion. Salt pork
is, good too, but it is very hard
The time to treat consump-
tion is when you begin trying
to hide it from yourself.
Others see it, you won't.
Don't wait until you can't
deceive yourself any longer.
Begin with the first thought
to take Scott's Emulsion. If
it isn't really consumption so
much the better; you will soon
forget it and be better for the
treatment. If it is consump'
tion you can't expect to be
cured at once, but if you will
begin in time and will be
rigidly regular in your treat-
ment you will win,
Scott's Emulsion, fresh air,
rest all you can, eat all you
can, that's the treatment and

OUR TREASURE IN KEATS.
Bis Poetry of Three Dimensions-
Height, Breadth and Solidity.
In reading Keats one is struck with
the wealth of his equipment, the solid
qualities of his art, his soaring Imagi
nation, his rare sense of beauty, his
range of emotional response, his rich
resources of language, and, not the
least noteworthy, his capability of
growth In taste. To consider what a
poet thus endowed might have given
to the world had he lived to the age of
Shakespeare or Milton excites the
mind almost to pain, so little short of
miracle was his actual achievement
We believe there Is no evidence that
he wrote a line of verse after his twen
ty-fifth year, and he probably wrote
little after his twenty-fourth, and yet
what a glorious body of life and Inspi
ration he has left! It Is poetry of three
dimensions— height, breadth and solid
ity: And yet, withal, it has arrowllke
intensity— a quality of which he him
self said, "The excellence of every art
is its intensity, capable of making all
disagreeables evaporate from their be
ing in close relationship with truth and
beauty.", ;.;:>,:;
His transcriptions of tbe classic into
modern speech in "Hyperion" and "La
mia," the wonderful music and coloi
of "The Evo of St Agnes," the deft
and eerie handling of ballad theines'lD
"La Belle Dame sans Merci" and "Isa
bella; or. The Pot of Basil," the over
flowing dreaminess of midsummer in
the "Ode to a Nightingale," the depth
and lyric directness of such lines as
"Iv a Drear Nlgnted December," and a
who!e antholojry of noble sonnets in
terpreting life and nature— these *are
but a' moiety of the overflowing stream
of his passionate imaginings, for hi
him the intellectual and the emotional
were kindly mixed. In tbe face oJ
such a record of quod work the faults
of his earlier manner are not worth
consideration.— Century.

A PICTORIAL DRAMA.
How Tweed Was Identified In Spain
by a Nast Cartoon.
No very strenuous effort had been
made to ]find Tweed, but it became
known at last that he was somewhere
in Spanish territory. As early as Sept
30 Nast cartooned the "boss" . as a
tiger appearing from a cave marked
"Spain." Now, suddenly, came anoth
er report— a cable— that one "Twid"
(Tweed) had been identified and cap
tured at Vlgo, Spain, on the charge of
"kidnaping two American children." £
' This seemed a curious statement, for
whatever may have been the boss' sins
he had not been given to child stealing.
Then came further news, and the mys
tery was explained. Tweed had been
identified and arrested at Vigo through
the cartoon "Tweedle-dee and Tilden
dum," drawn by Thomas Nast The
"street gamins"— to the Spanish office,
who did not read English— were two
children being forcibly abducted by the
big man of the stripes and club. The
printing on the dead wall they judged
to be the story of his crime. Perhaps -
they could even spell out the word fre
ward" hi an upper corner. '
Absurd as it all was, the identifica
tion was flawless. Tweed, on board
the steamer Franklin, came back to
America to die. When his baggage
was examined it was' found that he
had preserved every cartoon Nast had
drawn of him, save the few final ones
published after his escape, one of
which had placed him again behind
prison bars. On Oct. 1 Harper's re
published this picture with the story of
the boss' capture. The pictorial drama
was complete.— Albert Blgelow Paine

A REFORM MOVE.
The Direct Legislation League,
with headquarters at Los Angeles,
has entered upon a campaign to se
cure from the next legislature the
passage and submission to ' the peo
ple of a" constitutional amendment
providing for the initiative and
referendum in state, county and*
municipal legislation. Much may be
truthfully said against the proposi
tion to have laws, before goiuj* into
effect, submitted to a direct vote of
the people. It is no doubt a slow
and round-about way of passing
laws. But many thoughtful men
are coming to the conclusion that it
affords the only plan of checking the
passage of wild and immature
measures with which the state is
flooded every two years. It must be
confessed that many laws now cum
ber the statute books of the state,
and ordinance books of every coun ty,
which would probably never have
become laws if the final approval
thereof had been required of the
people. When laws are. referred
back to the voters, it secures dis
cussion of the merits or demerits of
the measures, the advocates and
opponents get to thinking and talk
ing, and the newspapers ventilate
the points in issue, so that before a
vote is taken the people are enabled
to form an opinion intelligently. As
it is now, laws are passed without
any such opportunity being given.
The referendum would relieve the
honest legislator of much responsi
bility which he now has to shoulder.
At the same time it would be a
stumbling-block in the path of the
unscrupulous lawmaker. It is only
the political schemers, who can work
out their own selfish ends under ex
• isting conditions, that would be
■ shorn of their streogth by the pro
posed plan of law-making. The peo
ple of Amador can readily see how
they might be benefitted, by the
referendum. Take the justices' and
constables' salary law for instance.
Will any one contend that that
measure would pass the gauntlet of
a popular vote. Furthermore, does
any one suppose that it will be
speedily wiped from the statute
book's under the present system?
Another case in point might be men
tioned — our present road system.
It has been the law for many years.
The system of a supervisor holding
the paid office of road commissioner
has never worked satisfactorily. It
is conceded that it never will be
satisfactory. And yet no effort ' is
made to change it. How long would
it stand if the people had the power
to demand that it pass muster at
the ballot box, or be declared void.
In our own law-making body in
Amador county, we have an example
in the present license law. The ver
dict of the people at the last election
clearly indicates that the changes
effected in this direction by the
supervisors this year would not be
upheld. The requirements exacted
are irksome and oppressive, without
any corresponding public benefit.
The referendum would tend to check
such ill-digested efforts at law
making. The legislative bodies have
drifted to the extreme of making
laws to suit their owu notions. The
people are beginning to realize that
it is about time they asserted their
own right to have a final voice in
the matter. 1 s .
THE WORKING OF UNWISE LI
CENSE LAWS. V.
The ultimate object of all laws
should be the benefit of the mass
es. All enterprises of an educational
character, and all tests of skill of a
harmless nature should be encour
aged as much as possible. If the
mere raising of money were the main
object of government, that could be
attained perhaps by a much less
complex and expensive system than
our present revenue laws. But the
■welfare of the community at large is
the main thing to be kept in mind
in the enactment of all laws. Any
scheme of getting money into the
treasury that in its practical opera
tion tends to keep out capital, or
prevent the starting up" of new
avenues of business, should be avoid-
Ed, whether by state or county legis
lative bodies it matters not. The idea
that a county government should
be shaped to restrict business to
actual resideuts of the county is
pernicious. It may and does work
well when applied to the nation at
large, in the protective tariff system
of the republican party, but to at
tempt to erect a barrier in favor of
the insider and against the outsider
of any town or county, by clapping
on an unjust license, is bound to be
in the long run detrimental to the
county's welfare. Business pros
perity consists in the active circula
tion of money in a community
through ths customary avenue of
trade. The more the dollars change
hands, the better it is from a busi
ness standpoint. When the artisan,
the laborer, and the professional
men cling to their earnings, from
whatever cause, business is dull, and
hard times prevail. There may still
be plenty of money in the com
munity, hut the fact that it is kept
idle, afraid to in vest, or prohibited
from investment by unwise enact
ments, is just as detrimental as
though there were an actual im
poverishment of the people. Hence
the need of legislation to encourage
investment in every legitimate
manner.
A few days ago Henry Chapman
made arrangements to open up a
shooting gallery in Jackson. He
rented premises, and spent several
days in fixing up for business. He
made a trip to the city, and pur
chased his outfit. All this was done
under the impression that a moder
ate license fee would be demanded
for such an enterprise. There cer
tainly is nothing immoral, nothing
that ought to be discouraged, in a
shooting gallery. Indeed, from the
viewpoint of national defense, such
enterprises ought' to be liberally
dealt with by the local managers.
Our national and state governments
spend millions'of dollars annually in
efforts to keep citizens up to a high
standard of markmanship. What
would it matter if the proprietor of
a^ gallery managed to pack away
several hundred dollars from the
town as the outcome of his venture.
The profits would be fairly earned,
and no harm would be done to either
individual or county. But Chapman
miscalculated the spirit of our local
government. On applying for a
license he found that $25 per" month
was the price for doing such a busi
ness. He figured the pros and cons
of the proposition, and reached the
conclusion that Amador county was
not a good field for his enterprise.
He pulled up stakes and departed
for some other place where the pow
ers that be are satisfied with a more
reasonable fee for the privilege of
trying to earn an honest livelihood.
By overdoing the license Amador is
out aud injured to the extent of a
living license rate, some property
holder is out for rent, hotels are out
of the price of board and lodging,
business houses lose the profit on
ammunition and other supplies, and
the boys are deprived of the pastime
of trying to improve in the direction
of target practice. We grabbed for
too much, and lost the whole cheese.
The president's message presented
to congress this week is a state
document of more than ordinary im
portance. It is rather lengthy, but
deals with all matters of national
moment in a vigorous and states
manlike manner. There is hardly a
question of any consequence before
thepeople that it does not discuss.
It takes firm grounds for the up
building of the navy, contending
that a strong fighting force on the
sea is the best and most economical
way of guaranteeing peace. It takes
up the naturalization and registra
tion laws, holding for a more uuiform
method of regulating such questions.
No radical changes are advocated in
the tariff, nor in the treatment of
the Phillipines, nor in the isthmian
canal question. It does recommend
a sweeping cut in the printing of
public documents by the govern
ment. It claims that one half of
this expense might be- dispensed
with without any injurious effect,
thereby effecting a saving of hun
dreds of thousands of dollars of use
less expense. There is no doubt that
this view will receive popular in
dorsement, and it is to be hoped
that it will be favorably acted upon
by congress. Altogether the mes
sage is an able paper, and is highly
spoken of by the press generally.

OLETA ITEMS.
Nover before, according to the mem
ory of our oldest residents, have
Oletaites enjoyed spring weather dur
ing the months of October and Novem
ber. On some of the near-by cattle
ranges the wild flowers seem to be get
ting ready to bloom. The greater part
of the summer fallow has been sown,
and the grain is growing rapidly, and
from present indications haying ought
to bogin about the first of February or
March.
Grant Shroeder, youngest son of H.
Shroeder, our old reliable merchant, is
expected home from Gait in a fow days.
Grant has been clerking for Whitaker
& Ray in their largo department storo,
and is considered a first-class salesman.
We'understand it is his intention to
purchase a half interest in his father's
store and take unto himself a life partner
from among our choice selection of
girls, and settle down permanently in
Oleta. We hope all rumors concern
ing the young man's intentions aro
true, for he is a worthy son of highly
respected parents.
Owing to sickness Miss Mary Billalon
was compelled to remain at home dur
ing the late teachers' institute at San
Jose, thereby missing what she con
siders the opportunity of a life-time.
Tho mining industry seems to have
taken a new start during tho last
month, and preparations aro boiug
made on several claims to work quite
extensively during tho wintor months.
The Pigeon Bros, have moved all
necessary machinery and supplies onto
their claim one mile northwest of town,
and will put on a good force of men in
a few days.
Clark & Mayon aro running a 1200
foot tunnel to tap a largo gravel bed,
and they expoct to reap a golden har
vest by early spring.
S. K. Thornton, who forraorly
operated a mine in Shonandoah valloy,
has purchased a claim near, town, and
has quite a crew of men working at
present. They have already taken out
some very rich ore. From prosent in
dications Mr. Thornton seoms to think
that he has found a little bonanza.
Taking everything iuto consideration
our little town seems moro choerful
than for several years past. With
grass in abundance, employment for
all the men, and a ready sale for every-,
thing that can be produced, wo would
consider it unreasonable to complain,
and selfish to ask for more. Oleta.

of Mrs. A. Sanguinetti of Mokelumne

Mokelumne Hill, where in the evening
a reception was held at the residence
of the bride's parents on Marietta
street. ' TShoro was a large number of

Tho bride is one of Calavoras' fairost

MINING NEWS
Kennedy.— The new forty stamp
addition to tho mill was started up last
Monday.' Like all new machinery 'of
this kind, it will take a little time to
get it into smooth and satisfactory
working order. The mill is working
as nicely as could bo expected, and
probably before these lines aro read the
100 stamps will be in steady operation,
crushing to their full capacity. The
working force is being added to, but
the maximum limit will no doubt re
quire a considerable increase to the
underground workers.
Argonaut.— We are pleased to be
able to announce that the 40stamp mill is
being put in readiness for active opera
tions, after a period of idleness extend
ing over a number of years, consequent
upon the litigation between tho Argo
naut and Kennedy. J Since the suit was
finally decided by the supreme court of
the United States in favor of the Argo
naut, the work of sinking the shaft and
opening up tho ore bodies in lower
levels has been steadily prosecuted. In
the sinking the shaft has been carried
down to a depth 0f. 2580 feet, and the
last set of timbers will probably be
placed next Sunday. Levels have been
opened at 1500, 1600, 1700 and 1800 feet,
and a good ore body encountered in
each, and from these levels tho rock
to keep the mill in steady operation
will be taken. Something like 2000
tons of ore has been accumulated on
the dumps. In two weeks more the
sound of tho stamps is expected to be
heard once more. This addition to
Jackson's mining industry, together
with the additional milling capacity of
the Kennedy, ought to insure lively
times in this camp for years to come.
Wendling Lumber Company Not Interested.
A statement was made in the Ledger
November 18, on the authority of a
notice to that effect that appeared in
one of our exchanges, that the Wend
ling Company of San Francisco was
behind tho lone and Eastern Railroad
Company now engaged in building a
railroad from lone to Martell's station.
Tho Lodger has received a letter from
the Wondling Company saying that
that company is not interested in the
movemont, and we gladly make the
correction accordingly.

The copper mines are still being

- The machinery for the Emma mine

about 75 men now employed, and the
force will bo increased as the mill nears
completion.

THE AMADOR IiED&ER; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1904.
DARING HOLD-UP.
A Stranger Enticed Into Woods Near
Kennedy and Bobbed of $180.
One of the neatest pieces of work in
tho hold-up line that Amador count;
has known, was perpetrated iv tho
vicinity of the Kennedy mine on Friday
evening last. An Italian named Ven
cenzo Marbitto arrived in Jackson on
Wednesday of last week. Ho had re
cently come down from British Colum
bia, having about $200 iv his possession.
He stayed at Sacramento at a board
ing house on Second street, and there
became acquainted with the three
countrymen who were instrumental in
relieving him of his cash. One of the
men accompanied him to Jackson,
Marbitto paying his fare, and at his
own solicitation giving or loaning him
$10 on reaching loae. Both reached
Jackson Wednesday, putting up at the
California hotel. On Thursday two
others, with whom he had become ac
quainted during his brief stay in Sac
ramento, arrived at the same hotel.
It is said they did tho walking act to
reach here. It is supposed they met
by prearrangement to do up the
stranger. Friday afternoon the four
men started out to look for work at tho
Kennedy mine. Marbitto was no doubt
in earnest in applying for work. They
went to the east shaft, and thence took
a trail over the hill toward the Oneida
mine. It was dark, and reaching a
spot favorable for their purpose, the
three men pounced upon Marbitto, and
took $180 in cash and his nickel watch,
valued at $5. He had $100 of the
money in a belt around his waist, and
$80 tied around tho calf of his leg.
After relieving him of his valuables,
according to ono story, the men tied the
victim's hands and foot, leaving him
just 20 cents as his own share in the
division of the money. He was liber
ated by some miners returning from
work. The sheriff's office was notified
at once, and officers started out in
different directions.
It has been learned that the name of
one of the gang Is Matteo Traverso.
He is 22 or 23 years old, weighs about
155 lbs,, curly chostnut hair, black suit
and black hat, wears shoes. The other
two, whose names are yet unknown,
are described as follows. One is 5 feet
6 or 7 inches in height, weighs 190 lbs,
reddish complexion, smooth shaved.
The other is 5 feet 9 or 10 inches in
height, weight about 180 lbs., about 30
years of age.
Sheriff Norman, deputies Jackson
and Kay, and constable Leverone and
others got the trail of the robbers the
following day. It seems they must
have camped somewhere about the
Fullen picnic grounds. One of the trio
was sent Sunday morning to Barsi's, at
Martell's station, for something to eat.
Two of them are thought to have
reached Amador City or near there
Sunday night. The officers are confi
dent of catching the criminals.
Shooting Affair.
W. H. Hancock, a saloon keeper of
Sutter Creek, went on the warpath
against a brother saloonman. D.
Odgers. on Thursday evening of last
week. The two men are brothers-in
law, although Hancock is a widower.
The origin of the trouble we are unable
to give. Hancock shot three times
through the front glass door of Odgers'
saloon. Odgers had been apprised of
the intended attack, and as a pre
cautionary move locked his saloon and
escaped by the back door. There was
no one in when the shooting occurred.
Hancock was arrested, and held for
trial for assault- with intent to commit
murder. He was let out on bonds in
the sum of $1500. He was also bound
over to keep the peace with $2000 bonds.

Moved to Copperppolis.
Supervisor E. B. Moore moved from
Sutter Creek to Copperopolis yester
day, with the intention of making his
future home there. His term as super
visor expires at the next meeting pf tho
board. He expects tp be in Jackson on
that occasion, and close up his official
business. Mrs. Moore has been in
Copperopolis since last September, con
ducting a boarding house. Copper
opolis is on the up-grade. A large
smelter is being erected, and the eppper
mining Interests are very promising.
Amador county regrets to lose such
citizens as Mr. Moore and family, and
earnestly wishes thorn abundant -uc
cess in their new field. We may state
that Mr. Moore has property interests
in Copperopolis, and lived in that
vicinity before' coming to Amador
county, about eight years ago.

WAGON GOES OVER GRADE.
Two Horses Killed and Driver Severely
Injured.
Saturday last Frank Tabeaud, em
ployed in driving one of Piccardo's big
ten-animal teams, met with an acci
dent which came near ending fatally to
him. His wagon was loaded with a
heavy mortar from the Baliol mine,
which he was in process of hauling to
the Hambley mine in Calaveras county,
proceeding by way of Hunt's gulch and
Middle Bar. At a point in Hunt's
gulch, near where tho old Kelly mill
once stood, there is a sharp bend in the
road, and the roadway is very narrow
also, making it a dangerous place for a
big heavily loaded team. Tabeaud
had traveled the road frequently, and
is one of the most careful drivers. . The
load weighed several tons, and the
truck on which it was mounted was
above the average size. At the point
named, Tabeaud tried to make the turn
with six animals, ■ hitching the other
four behind the wagon, aud himself
seated on one of the wheelers. The
wheel approached to the edge of the
gulch, and the ground being unsup
ported, the wagon tilted, and before
Tabeaud was awaro that anything was
amiss, the whole outfit was precipitated
into the gulch, forty feet below the
road. The four animals behind broke
the halter and managed to escape. The
six in front were carried with the
freight into the gulch. Another team
chanced to 1)6 a short distance behind,
and when he came to the spot hastened
to the rescue, with what assistance he
could get.. Tabeaud was found pinned
underneath his riding animal, which
was killed outright. The driver was
extricated, and conveyed to bis home
in Jackson, where he has been confined
to his bed since. No bonos were broken,
but he is suffering considerably, and
may have sustained internal injuries.
One of the other animals was severely
hurt, and died soon afterward. The
wreck lay in the gulch several days.
Piccardo's loss by this misfortune will
foot up in the neighborhood of $500.
The Railroad..
The large locomotive for the love
and Eastern railroad arrived in Loili a
few days ago. After undergoing a
little needed repairs it will be forwarded
to its destination at lone, and engage
in the construction work of the road.
Some 275 men aro now at work on the
railroad, with about 200 horses. It is
now claimed that when Martoll's sta
tion is reached, the road will bo con
tinued, without delay, both toward
Sutter Creek and Jackson. Tho talk
of the new enterprise, said to bo backed
by the Western Pacific, from Sacra
mento to Sutter Creek, will act as a
spur to this company to extend its line
along the mineral belt in order to tap
the large and growing trado of that
section. It must depend upon this
trade for its financial success, and can
not afford to let any portion slip from
its grasp for,a few additional miles of
road.
The project of extending the railroad
to the timber country has been revived
by the visit last Sunday of a number of
business men to spy out the country
to the east. The party consisted of
D. A. McCall, Ben Holt and W. H.
Braden of the Holt' Manufacturing
Company of Stockton, T. A. Chichi
zola of the Amador Lumber Company,
and A. B. Buer of the A. B. and A. L.
Stone Company of Oakland. This visit
is heralded by some as the forerunner
of railroad construction. By others it
is regarded as a preliminary stop to
the introduction of the traction engino
in the hauling' o'f lumber in the eastern
section of Amador.

The Sr. Staples' Case.
Tho country has been flooded with
descriptive circulars of Dr. F. N.
Staples and Mrs. Hoxie, who fled from
San Francisco lately on tl:e appearance
of an item in tho papers there that the

Amadur county on a charge of murder.
So far nothing has boon heard of thnir
whereabouts. They have dropped out
of sight. The sheriff's office a few da ys
ago received a communication from a
constable in a small lowa town, inclosing
a clipping from the Dubuque Telegraph
of November 20, 1904. The paper gives
an account of a divorce suit in which
Dr. Staples is plaintiff. It does not
give the initials of the doctor in the
extract, but the constable In the ac
companying letter does. It seems that
the divorce case is a contested one,
Mrs. Staples having filed a cross com
plaint, which soon after its filing was
taken away, and has not been, and, it
is said, will not be returned. It appears
that Mrs. Staples left her home in lowa
last spring, and thereafter wrote her
husband that she would not return.
She went to Bauff, Alberta, Canada.
She alleged that incompatibility of
temper, inability to agree on household
affairs, and other matters prevented her
returning. On the receipt of this letter,
suit for divorce was commenced. The
article conveys the idea that there is a
good deal of secrecy about the case; the
attorneys refusing to discuss any of its
phases. The matter of contest appears
to be in regard to alimony. Steps are
being taken to ascertain if the Dr.
Staples, who is suing for divorce, is the
same person who is wanted in this
county on the murder charge.
Inquiry leads to the conclusion that
the Dr. Staples concerned in this suit is
not the fugitive from Amador. We
this week received a marked copy of
the Farmington Chronicle, Maine, re
publisbing the articles from the Ledger
bearing on this case. Farmington is
near Templo, where Dr. and the late
Mrs. Staples formerly lived. The
people there, judging from the local
paper, are greatly exercised over the
sensational developments.
I A Great Surprise
There appeared last week on the
awning in front of Miss M. A.
Gass' Millinery Store a large sign
which means considerable. This
is a treat for the people of Jack-
son, as in her store is to be seen
the most beautiful doll ever dis-
played in town, and on which
every purchaser buying $1 worth

Big Freight for Standard Electric.
Tho first load of the heavy electric
machinery for the new power line of
tfne Standard Electric Company at
Electra passed through Jackson Wed
nesday at, noon. It consisted of one
piece, weighing 9* tons, comprising one
of the three transformers. This mas
sive ironwork stood 7 feet high and about
4 feet square. It was mounted on one of
the heavy trucks, with sqlid lumber
wheels imported by the company for
this special work. It required 18
animals to move it as far as Jackson,
and would probably need more leverage
before it reached its destination at the
plant. The veteran driver, Jack
Duf rene, with his best team, undertook
the hauling. Hundreds,' of people
gathered pn Main street to witness
making the sharp turn at the junction
of Wator and Broadway streets. No
hitch occurred. It made the turn as
easily as an ordinary log team. The
team, load and drivers were photo
graphed by Geo. McMillan on Main
street. This is only a bagatelle com
pared to other loads yet tQ come. It
is said that'pieces of machinery weigh
ing between 20 and 30 tons are expected
shortly. This 9$ ton piece was sufficient
to break one of the solid granite blocks
in tho crossing in front of the Ledger
office building.
A Dog-Gone Case.
A jury was impaneled in Justice
Gold tier's court last Wednesday to
wrestle with a dog case. The dqg is
dead, and therein lieq the cause of the
trouble. The defendant was a man
named Coleman from Campo Seco, and
the complaining witness George Green
wood... It seems in August last Cole
pan, his wife and a child, were driving
in a surrey from Campo Seep tp_ ffaclt-:
son. This side of Middle Bar,' acbo'rd
ing to the version given by the defense,
the buggy was stopped, and occupants
alighted for a brief space. Then the
dog came into tho story, barking and
scaring the child. Coleman tried to
drive it away by snapping his whip.
The dog kopt up his yelping. Coloman
then got a rillo from the buggy and
blazed away twice, aimlessly, to scare
away the animal. Still he" persisted.
Finally Coleman fired for business, and
the dog went away howling, and after
ward died from the gunshot wound.
The prosecution contended that the
killing was done malicipusly; that tho
firing occurred while the buggy was in
motion; that it was witnessed by two
boys, who testified to that effect.
Greenwood wanted the shooter to pay
the value of tho dog, or give good
reasons for shooting it. Defendant
would do neither. lie nee the suit for
malicious misobiof. The jury after a
brief deliberation rendored a verdict of
not guilty. C. H. Crocker appeared
for the defendant, while the district
attorney conducted the prosecution.
No More Suffering.
If you are troubled with indigestion
get a bottle of Kodol Dyspepsia Cure
and see how quickly it will cure you.
Geo. A. Thomson, of Spencer, la., says:
"Have had Dyspepsia for twenty years.
My case was almost hopeless. Kodol
Dyspepsia Cure was recommended and
I used a few bottles of it and it is the
only thing that has relieved me. Would
not be without it. Have dootcired with
local physicians and also at Chicago,
and even went to Norway with hopes
of getting some relief, but Kodol Dys
pepsia Cure is the only remedy that
has done mo any good, and I heartily
recommend it. Every person suffering
with Indigestion pr Dyspepsia should
use it." Sold by all druggists.

Bitten by a Dog.
Paul Guerard, who lives in the south
part of town, was severely bitten by a
dog last Friday. A brace of dogs — his
own and a neighbor's— started in to
chaw each other near Guerard's house.
Guerard went to separate them, and in
the mix-up one of the dogs seized
Guerard's left hand, lacerating it badly,
requiring three stitches to close the
wound. Guerard had been unable to
work for several weeks on account of
rheumatism, and this additional mis
fortune will further delay his return to
his employment.

THE jIMADOR tEPGEIt; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. DECEMBER 9, 1904.
THE NEGRO DIALECT.
Some Comments on Paul Laurence
Diiiitmr'H Efforts to Sustain It.
"As a rule the negro who has grown
out of the dialect of his race makes an
extremely poor showing in an effort to
mimic the negro's talk," said an ob
servant man, "and his efforjs to write
it are even more pronounced faHures.
But Paul Laurence lumbar, the negro
poet, has written at least one thing In
which lie sustained the dialect of hie
race. In the 'Death Song* Dunbar got
closer to the talk and the nature of the
negro than in any other effort It is
worth recalling, so here It is:
"Lay me down beneaf de wlllers in de
grass,
Whah do branch '11 go a-singln' as it pass.
Au' w'en I's a-layln' low
I kin hyeah it as It so
Slngln', "Sleep, my honey, tek yo' res' at
las'.'
"Lay me nigh to whah hit meks a little
pool.
An' de watah stan's so quiet lak an' cool,
Whah de little birds In spring
Ust to come an' drink an' slug,
An' the chlllen waded on dey way tc
school.
"Let me settle w'en my shouldahs draps
dcy load
Nigh enough to hyeah de noises in de
road,
Fu' I t.'lnk de las' long res'
Gwine to soothe my sperrit bes'
Ef I's layin' 'mimg de things I's allus
knowed.
"You will observe here that he shows
the negro's strong devotion to the 'i,'
and it is interesting because of the
tendency on the part of writers of ne
gro dialect to force the T out by the
substitution of 'a.' Dunbar's use of 'Is
for the improper 'I is' Is genuine. Most
negro dialect writers of today would
write it 'Ah's,' for they nearly always
use 'Ah' for 'I.' So he shows the same
preference for 'i' in the lines- 1
"An' w'en I's a-layln' low
I kin hyeah It as it go
Slngin', 'Sleep, my honey, tek yo' res' at
las'.' J • . •
"Here we have T's' and T kin,' both
showing the negro's devotion to the
sound of 'I.' So he uses 'gwine' for 'go
ing,' probably errs in the distinctive
'gwin to,' for the negro, as a rule, will
make one word out of the phrase, giv
ing it more the sound of 'gwinter.' But,
on the whole, the dialect is good and
Is well sustained." — New Orleans
Times-Democrat.
POINTED PARAGRAPHS.
One-half the stuff you buy does you
no good.
Don't carry a lot of keys to private
drawers. Burn papers you don't want
seen. ;■. -
A dollar is a large amount to pay for
bread, but it is mighty insignificant in
a poker game.
When some people haven't any great
trouble, they smile as much as to say,
How brave I am!
Many a good man fusses a great
deal about nothing and makes himself
unnecessarily disagreeable.
There is this in being a parent: They
get the abuse if their children are bad
and no particular credit if they are
good.— Atchison Globe.
Fife Thousand Distinct Languages.
Mr. J. Collier is authority for the
statement that there are no less than
5,000 distinct languages spokeu by
mankind. The number of separate dia
lects is enormous. There are more
than sixty distinct vocabularies in Bra
zil, and in Mexico the Nahua language
has been broken up into 700 dialects.
There are hundreds in Borneo. The
complexities are beyond classification
in Australia, and generally the num
ber of dialects decreases with the in
tellectual culture of the population. If
there is an average of fifty dialects
to every language we still have the
enormous total of 2D0.000.
Burying the Inn Sign.
In some parts of England when a
public house loses its license the sign
board is solemnly buried. On the last
night it is removed from over the door
and "waked" in the bar by the old
customers. When the clock points to
closing time and the house ceases its
career as an inn the signboard Is car
ried out in procession and interred
with an appropriate burial service,
which ends with watering the grave
with a gallon of beer or a bottle of
whisky.
Nothing: to Fear.
Judge Rockwood Hoar, brother of
Senator Hoar, was noted as a wit as
Well as a jurist. Shortly before his
death, as his daughter entered his
room in the morning, he said: "My
dear, I had a dream last night, and in
it I saw the angel of death sitting at
the foot of my bed. At first I was
horribly frightened, but as I gazed at
toy visitor my fears vanished. He
wore a fur cap."— Brooklyn Life.
The Opportunity.
It was night.
They— he and she— were sitting on
the porch looking at the stars.
"You know, I suppose," he whis
pered, "what a young man's privilege
is when he sees a shooting star?"
"No," she answered. "I haven't the
slightest Idea. There goes one!"— Ch
icago Tribune.
Soup.
"Who goes there?"
"Godfrey— Godfrey— Godfrey de Bou
iljon," stammered the young actor with
his. first two line part.
"Supe, supe!" yelled the unfeeling
gallery.— Plttsburg Post.
Even Worie,
Mrs. Hoyle— I hear that your hus
band died Intestate. Mrs. Doyle— Well,
I don't know what his trouble was, but
lie had to have an operation.— Town
Topics.
Malice eats up^the greatest part of
her own venom and therewith poison
eth herself.— Montaigne.
GREAT THOUGHTS.
Tber Have the Gift of Immortal
Youth und StreiiKth.
Tbe Influence of tlie law of action
and reaction can be traced more clear
ly in those everyday buuian affairs
which come under our individual ob
servation than in the greater aiove
ments of mankind which are often im
perfectly recorded. We act and are
acted upon. The people we meet make
an impression on us; the impression
may be for the moment or it may last
through life. Bloom, fragrance, grace,
harmony, beauty, majesty, affect U3
agreeably; deformity, imbecility, dis
tress, cruelty, affect us unpleasantly.
The plea of the unfortunate, the
thought of our visitor, tho opinion in
the newspaper, the Issues of the time,
Impress us in accordance with our
moods or natures. Certain words, tones,
eights, awaken echoes within us of old
happiness or pain.
There are words and tones which
produce beautiful reactions— the lulla
bies of the mother, tho endearments of
the lover, the voice of sympathy, the
enchantment of music, the messages
of the poets, the trumpet calls to hon
or-and duty. And there are words
which produce misunderstanding, con
fusion, aversion, anger— the words of
whining, complaining, fault finding, of
envy, jealousy, slander, of malice, in
tolerance, brutality.
The response to the public speaker is
reciprocal to his power. If he bo dull,
the hearers are wearied; if he be con
vincing, courageous, forceful, the au
dience will kindle, and he may rouse
them to laughter or tears, to indigna
tion or fury, to generosity or sacrifice.
He may change the opinions and con
victions of some and the course of the
lives of others; he may even save a
city from slaughter or make a state.
If his thought be really great, it may
live through many ages, stirring gen
eration after generation. The reaction
of moral effort may be prolonged; it
may even gain force with time, indi
cating its connection with some stu
pendous primal energy. The echo of a
great physical convulsion dies quickly,
but the echo of the words of Confu
cius and Buddha, of Plato, Seneca and
Christ, still lives. The voice of Socrates
before his judges kindles men whose
ancestors were untamed savages when
Socrates spoke. Buildings decay,- mon
uments fall, rivers run dry, races de
cline, but a great thought suffers from
no impairment or decrepitude; it -has
the gift of immortal youth and
strength.— From "Balance: The Funda
mental Verity," by Orlando J. Smith.
Why Some Folks Go to Europe.
When New York society doesn't know
what else to do it goes abroad. An
ambitious woman gets wind of some
rival's intended function. Not to be
invited or not to be seen among the
guests means a slight easily endured
If the world be not cognizant of tho
fact, but Intolerant If it is; therefore
the .ambitious woman sails away to
Europe. She may not be gone six
weeks, but her absence is thus to be
accounted for. In other cases it la
known that society takes this absent
treatment to cure heart troubles, to es
cape social obligations that weigh too
heavily on tho income or, again, from
sheer ennui it departs. This restless
ness of certain sets in society would
be dangerous were it. not for the safety
valve which that really overworked
Atlantic* ocean has become of lato
years. When all else falls, go to Eu
rope.—Boston Herald.
The Beautiful.
Beauty prevails in spite of all we
do. We may build ugly buildings, we
may think ugly thoughts, we may
wrinkle ourselves in worries or the
contemplation of ugliness, we may
even worship ugliness 'under the name
of utility, but lightly, without an ef
fort, the gentle • hand of beauty de
scends upon all. Seauty may do her
subtle work in many ways. Sun, moon,
fog and rain are alike her servants.
The fresh red houses, garish eyesores
in the sun, become wonderful as they
loom blood red before the man in the
mist, or in a few years the red Is
quieted, and the searching light only
makes it more beautiful.— Arthur Kan
some.
A Conversion.
A country circus advertised that "at
12 o'clock the cannibals will be fed."
A large crowd assembled, but to every
body's disappointment the savages ate
potatoes. In reply to some indignant
questions the manager said': "But, gen
tlemen, don't you see that their diet
is evidence of my skill? I have con
verted, them into vegetarians."—Flie
gende Blatter.
The SelllHli Man.
A bachelor one day set the table in
his lonely abode with plates for him
self and an imaginary wife and five
children. He then sat down to dine,
and as ho helped himself to fooU he
put the same quantity on each of the
other plates and surveyed the prospect,
at the same time computing the cost.
He Is still a bachelor.
The Game of Life.
Life is a queer game of blind man's
buff, played In a mist on a mountain
topi nnd the players keep dropping over
" o precipices. But nobody heeds be-
Miise there are always plenty more,
and the game goes on forever. — H.
Rider Haggard.
Good to Have and Dad to Lose.
"A man, like a razor, must have
some temper to be any good at all."
"Yes, temper Is a good thing to have,
but a very bad thing to lose."—Phila
delphia Press.
An Impudent fellow may counterfeit
modesty, but a modest man can never
counterfeit Impudence.— Goldsmith.

THE HOTEL BREAKFAST.
how the American Bleal Appears an
an Englishman.
The American hotel breakfast is
representative of the general delight Id
good living. The length of the menu
and the variety of the dishes bespeak
an appetite that in the early morning
can relish a meal little- less substantial
than a dinner.
The hotel breakfast begins with fruit
—grape fruit if it happens to be in sea
son, the bitter sweetness of which
seems designated by nature to awaken
the appetite. And there Is really a be
wildering problem when next you are
asked to choose among the cereals—
from the old fashioned oatmeal to all
kinds of predlgested preparations.
Cooked oysters in every style are of
fered on the menu, and even In the best
restaurants a plate of oysters cobts
only a shilling. The choice of fish can
*be made from a long list— of kinds un
known In England, Including weakfish,
blueflsh and shad, with its delicate roe.
It must be out of compliment to Eng
lish travelers that herring and haddock
are imported. You see them very sel
dom on an American breakfast table.
When boiled eggs are eaten they are
opened by the waiter* into a glass, no
small quantity of butter being added—
salt butter, for "sweet" butter Is sel
dom served. With chops or steak the
American, who never eats cold meats
at breakfast, usually orders potatoes,
and the meal may be brought to a close
with pancakes. These hot cakes, which
are made of wheat, buckwheat, rice or
cornmeal, are eaten smothered In ma
ple sirup, a delicious treacle obtained
from the sap of maple trees.
The . American drinks coffee for
breakfast— such a coffee as you may
find in Paris, but not in London — and
that he does not prefer tea would need
no other explanation than the failure
to understand the art of making It-

THE FIRST PIE PLATES.
They Were Hade by the German
Fottera of Philadelphia.
The first pie plates were made early
In the eighteenth century by the Ger
man potters who settled In Philadel
phia.
After the clay was prepared It waß
cut Into small pieces by means of a
brass wire and taken to the work
bench to be made Into plates.
The clay was roughly beaten Into a
flattened form looking like a colossal
buckwheat cake. This was rolled out
into a thin sheet with a roller much
like a rolling pin, and then a disk
cutter was used to cut It Into circu
lar pieces of the required diameter.
This bat, as It was called, was then
laid on a board until partly dry and
was then decorated.
The slip decoration was applied by
means of a slip cup, an earthen vessel
with goose quills Inserted Into the
openings, through which the liquid
slip was made to trickle over the ware
in a variety of patterns, just as icing
is applied to cake at the present time.
The slip mixture was of a creamy col
or made of white clay and water.
Favorite motives for decorations
were flowers, fruits and scenes, tulips
being a special pet.
A Lutheran minister asked his potter
to dine with him to discuss designs for
a set of plates he wished to order.
As the potter was accustomed to dine
at 12, he was almost famished when
the clergyman's 2 o'clock dinner was
served. When the set of plates came
home, each with a pious sentiment In
terwoven among the marginal decora
tions, the minister laughed to find an
extra plate, bearing this Inscription: "I
have never been at a place where
they dine so late." So much for Penn
sylvania-German humor.— Philadelphia
Ledger.
A Rebellions Actor.
Frederick Lemaltre, the French ac
tor, was playing ltobert Macalre in a
town of France where two soldiers of
the garrison represented the policemen
who had to arrest him. In the spirit
of his part he gave one of them a vig
orous kick. "Ha, we must see to this!"
cried the Infuriated soldier and prompt
ly knocked Lemaltre Into the orchestra.
At this there was a terrific din, and
the soldier began to see that the vin
dication of his uniform was not popu
lar. But Lemaltre, when he regained

Hats, Boots and Hearts.
Mrs. Nolan had made some disparag
ing remarks about the costume of her
husband's bosom friend, Mr. Herllby,
and they were promptly resented.
" 'His hat Is turning green wld age,'
Is It?" said Mr. Nolan, with fine scorn,
"and 'his boots Is rusty and cracked
lookin',' did I hear ye say? Listen now
to me, Mary Nolan. If lvery man's hat
nn' boots covered as warrm a hearrt as
Phellm HerMhy's there'd be more proud
wlmmln In the worrldl"
