THE MAGIC NUMBER.
A Suggestion by the Cynic That Set
the Others Thinking;.
"I often hear of the magic number,"
said some one. "What number Is it?"
"Why, nine, of course," replied some
one else. "Tliere are nine muses, you
know, and you talk of a nine days'
wonder. Then you bowl at ninepins,
and a cat has nine lives." .
"Nonsense!" broke in another. . '.'Sev
en is the magic number. Seventh
heaven, don't you know, and all that;
seven colors In the rainbow, seven
days in the week, seventh son of a
seventh son— great fellow— and"— |
"Tush, tush!" remarked a third.
"Five's the number you mean. . A
man has five fingers on his hand and
five toes on his foot, and be has five
senses, and"—
"Three is undoubtedly the magic
number," interrupted another, "because
people give three cheers, and Jonah
was inside a whale three days I and
three nights, and if at first you don't
succeed, try, try again— three times,
you see!"
This was received with some con
tempt by the company, and a soulful
youth gushed out:
"Two, oh, two is the magic num
ber — oneself and one other, the adored
one— Just two!"
A hard featured individual, who bad
been listening to the conversation hith
erto unmoved, here remarked in a
harsh \olce:
"The magic number is number one
in this world, and If you want to sue:
ceed never forget it."

JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY. - CAIiIJTOItSIA, FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 14. 1902.
Bp-otUm of Genlm.
A writer in the London Standard de
clares tbe idea that genlue is usually
modest to be a popular delusion. On
the contrary, he alleges egotism to be
the very essence of true genius and
quotes many amusing examples.
When Wordsworth, Southey and
Coleridge were walking together and
Coleridge remarked that tbe day was
so fine "it might have been ordered for
three poets," the gentle Wordsworth
promptly exclaimed: "Three poets!
Who are tho otli er two ?" v
Disraeli, then a mere youth, wrote to
his sister that ho had heard Macaulay,
Shell and Grant speak, "but between
•ourselves I could floor them 'all," And
again he said, "When I want to read a
good book, I write one."
Our own Joaquin Miller wrote to
Walt Whitman: "You and I are over
the head of the rabble. We know we
aro great, and If other people don't
know It It is their own fault"
It was President Grant who, being
told that a certain senator, an admit
ted genius who was very hostile to
him, did not believe the Bible, ex
pressed his estimate of the senator's*
egotism by rejoining: "Why should he?
He didn't write it, you know."— New
York World.
Buying a Ruor.
"I need a new razor," said the man
who shaves himself.
"Better let mo get It for yon," sug
gested the reformed barber, who, now
that he Is a trolley car conductor,
regards himself as a distinguished
member of society. "All cutlery stores
are filled with razors of the class
known as 'dead ones.' When a barber
buys a razor, he takes it with the un
derstanding that he is to try it out, and
if it doesn't work well he takes It back
and gets another one, keeping this up
until he gets one that suits him. Buy-
Ing a razor, you know, is a lottery In
which tho prizes' are" few and far be
tween. When the ordinary ciUzen goes
to a cutlery store, he picks oufVhat he
thinks Is a good razor, pays for It and
takes his chances. He picks one out,
.tool from the bunch of 'dead ones' that
barbers have tried and found wanting.'
That's why I advise you to let me get
It for you. Then if you don't like it I
can keep exchanging it until you get a
good one. They needn't know I've quit
Ithe business."— Philadelphia Record.
The Woolsack.
- Back during the time of Queen Eliza
beth an act of parliament was passed
prohibiting the exportation of wool.
This product was one of the great
sources of the natural wealth of Eng
land at that time, and in accordance
with the economic notions of the age
the authorities attempted to keep it In
the country, Imagining that if it went
abroad, even though something more
valuable or desirable were exchanged
for it, the country would be the poorer.
In order to hold the Importance of
this commodity before the minds of the
national legislators woolsacks were
placed in the house of lords, where the
Judges sat. Hence the lord chancellor,
who presides over the house of lords,
"sits on the woolsack." The woolsack,
according to a printed description, is a
"large square bag of wool without
back or arms and covered with red
cloth."
"Faints."
Fusel oil, or "faints," as It Is com
monly called about the distilleries In
England, according to the London Lan
cet, Is a primary nmji alcohol mixed
with primary and secondary propyl al
cohols. In England it can be obtained
gratis at some distilleries. It is used
locally as an external application for
rheumatism. It Is obtained from fer
mented grain or potatoes by continu
ing the process of distillation after the
ordinary spirit has all "come over." It
Is. an oily liquid, with a burning, acrid
taste and an odor', said to resemble
Jargonelle pear. It has intoxicating
and poisonous properties considerably
more powerful than ordinary spirits.
Hast Give a Horseshoe.
An old manorial rite exists at Oak
ham, In Rutlandshire, England, where
every peer of the realm Is bound the
first time he enters the town to present
a horseshoe to be nailed on the old por
tal, which is well nigh covered with
these tributes. It is said that In case
any contumacious peer should refuse
to pay this tax the authorities have a
right to stop his carriage and levy
blackmail by unshoeing one of the
horses. To avert so serious an annoy
ance the tribute shoe is generally ready,
some being of enormous size and In
scribed with the name of the donor.
Harsh Neighbors.
"How do you like your neighbors?"
. "Not a bit," said the woman who was
tying a little boy's hat on. "You see,
they don't like children."
"How do you know?"
"They hurt Reginald's feelings dread
fully. When he throws stones at their
dog or plays the hose on their window,
they look real cross at him!"— Was
hington Star.
The Unpleasant Boarder.
"You do not often get better steak
than that," said the landlady, hoping

The Blow Landed.
She doesn't go to her clubs and eu
chres half as much as she did. Peo
ple used to say. this charming woman
spent most of her time at these gather
ings. One day she called on a dear
friend to reprove her for her slacken
ing interest in the club. I believe it
was a club^or reforming the gas met
er or something— anyhow it was a re
form affair:
"Look here, Lizzie," said the enthu
siast, "why on earth don't you come
to the meetings? Here you are paying
your dues and uever showing up. You
owe it. to the club to take an interest
in the work."
"But ■ I can't come," explained her
friend. "There's the baby, and Henry
doesn't come home sometimes till late,
and supper must wait, and if he wants
to go out I can't go away and leave
the children. I would worry myself
to death."
"Well, I must say Henry Is inconsid
erate," said the caller. "Why, there's
my -husband and children too. They,
give me no trouble. Every tlruo I want
to go to the club Charlie says he will
be glad to stay at home with Bridget
and keep an eye on things till I come
back. He never objects."
"Maybe," retorted the amiable host
ess, "If I had a housegirl as handsome
and young as Bridget Henry would be
glad to stay at home, too, but mine Is
black and goes home at nights."
The blow landed, and Charlie hasn't
been asked to look after Bridget and
the house since. — Louisville Times.
Length of Dreams.
Three physicians were discussing the
matter of the length of dreams a day
or two ago. when one of them related a
strange experience.
"Yesterday afternoon," ho said, "I
called to see a patient, and. much to
my satisfaction, I found him sleeping
soundly. I sat by his bed, felt of his
pulse without disturbing him and wait
ed for him to awaken. - After a few
minutes a junk dealer's cart with dis
cordant ringing bells turned into the
street, and as their first tones reached
us my patient opened his eyes.
" 'Doctor.' he said, 'I'm glad to see
you and awfully glad that you woke
me, for I have been tortured by a most
distressing dream that must have last
ed for several hours. I dreamed that I
was sick, as I am, and that my boy
came Into the room with a string of
most horribly sounding sleighbells and
rang them in my ears, while I hadn't
power to move or speak to him. I suf
fered tortures for what appeared to be
an Interminable time. I'm so glad you
woke me.'
"The ringing of those bells for one
second had caused all of that dream
and Just at the waking moment."—
New York Herald.
Hairbrushes.
No amount of washing of the hair
will keep it clean if dirty brushes are
used, yet persons otherwise fairly neat
are careless in this respect A special
ist Bays that " hairbrushes should be
washed once a. week and, if used on
hair In which there is much dandruff,
twice a week is not too often. The
brushes should be washed in cold, not
hot, waterj to which cloudy ammonia
has been added in the proportion of a
scant tablcspoonful to a quart of wa
ter. Care should bo taken not to wet
the baaks of the brushes, and when
washed and rinsed— a good way to
rinse them properly Is to use a shower
spray on them — they should be put on
edge to the air to dry. Dress combs,
too, should be frequently cleaned, a
comb cleaner being used for the pur
pose.
"A Nine Days' Wonder."
The memorable reign of Lady Jane
Grey Is said to have given rise to the
phrase, "A nine days' wonder." Lady
Jane was proclaimed queen of England
July 10,' 1553, four days after the death
of Edward VI. After the lapse of a
period of nine days, on July 10, she re
linquished her title to the crown, thus
terminating her reign in the short space
of a week and a half. A noted Eng
lish historian says, "Thus we come to
the end of the diary of that short and
troubled reign that from Its length is
said to have given rise to the now
(1G20) popular phrase, 'A nine days'
wonder.' " ,
Recklessness.
"Inherited wealth," exclaimed the
blase young man, with a dreary yawn,
"is a cur.se!"
"Then why don't you try to get rid of
It" asked the youth who hadn't Inherit
ed any wealth.
. "I am doing the best I can," rejoined
the other. "I keep a yacht, run an au
tomobile, belong to a swell golf club
and lend you money."— Chicago Trib
une.

will you do to earn it?"

Passing a Bargain.

a big bargain In a diamond ring!"
queried the Boston drummer as be
heaved a sigh and his face went

"Yes, several times," laughed the
Pullman conductor. ?'. ■:■
"I was in Plttsburg," continued the
drummer, "and while standing on a
street corner a chap came along and
offered me a shiner as big as a bean
for $50. lie was a stranger, hard up
and all that. It looked to be a ring
worth $350."
"And you gave him $50?"
"Xo. He hung on for half an hour,
but I turned him down. I'm no man to
be roped In that way."
"Then what— what"—
"Oh, another fellow bought the ring."
"And he was out his fifty?"
"He was in $300. That ring. sir. was

A Savage BlnrJay.
A sportsman camping on one of the
lakes of Sullivan county, N. V., offered
to bet $10 to $1 that nobody In bis par
ty could guess how be had received an
Injury to a finger which lie held bleed-
Ing before the spectators. No one guess
ed, and the man went on to explain
that while standing by tbe lake be bad
seen a bluejay flying over so close
above his head. that he Instinctively
threw up his hand to stop it. The bird
neither stopped nor swerved, but. In
stead dashed straight for the hand,
striking It with such force that the bill
penetrated to the bone and isent the
blood spurting as though the man had
been struck by a knife.
This sort of action Is In line with tbe
general conduct of tho Jay. It is one of
the most aggressive birds on the con
tinent, robbing the nests of other birds
and sometimes even killing young squir
rels. The chief good thing that can be
said of it Is that it often robs the nest
of the English sparrow.
The Maori and the Witness.
Captain Hayes In his book, "Among
Horses In South Africa," tells several
amusing stories. A friend of his In
New Zealand had been a government
inte»preter among the Maoris and had
many stories to tell about these people.
On one occasion a native chief, who
was under cross examination in court,
on being asked why he had not brought
a certain man with him replied: .
"I have brought him."
"But," said the barrister, looking In
vain round the court, "I don't see him.
Where is he?" .j
"He Is here," chuckled the Maori
proudly, stroking his massive chest
Peculiar Taxation In Holland.
Some of the most peculiar of taxa
tions recorded are to be found In the
archives of Holland. In 1701, for In
stance, there was In existence -a tax
Imposed on all passengers traveling In
Holland. In 1874 a duty of 2 shillings
was levied on each person who entered
a tavern before noon, on those who en
tered a place of entertainment, on mar
riages and deaths and on many other
things. If a person was burled out of
the district to which he belonged, the
tax was payable twice over.— Plttsburg
Dispatch.
The Horses and Saddle.
A man bought three horses and ' a
saddle for $220. If he puts the saddle
on the first horse, they cost as much
as the other two horses; if he puts the
saddlo on the second Lorso, they cost
two times as much as the first I and
third, and if he puts the saddle on the
third horse they cost three times as
much as the first and second. Find
the cost of each.— Mathematical Puj

The Discovery of Borax In Death
Valley by Aaron Winters.
The greatest discovery of borax In
the United* States was made In the ter
ribly hot region known as Death val
ley and In a most romantic way. The
Chicago Record tells the story.
In 1880 Aaron Winters lived with his
wife, Rosle, In a gulch known as Ash
Meadows, not far from the mouth of
Death valley. : He was so fond of
big wife that he would not allow her to
be long absent from him, although
their little hut on the side of the moun
tain was a hundred miles from the
nearest neighbor. In a wild, rugged,
forsaken country.
One day a desert tramp came along
and spent the night at the Winters
home. He told the hunter about the
borax deposits of Nevada. When he
went away, Winters thought that he
had seen deposits of the same kind on
his explorations Into Death valley.
Accordingly he and his wife went to
gether to make the search, having pre
viously provided themselves with cer
tain t<wt chemicals, which when com
bined with borax and ignited would
produce a green flame.
Having procured a piece of the sub
stance which he believed to be borax,
Winters and his wife "waited for night
fall to make the test How would It
burn?
For years they had lived like Plutes
on the desert, entirely without luxuries
and often wanting for the very necessi
ties of life. Would the match change
all that?
Winters held the blaze to the sub
stance with a trembling band, then
shouted at the top of his voice: "She
burns green, Rosle 1 We're rich! We're
rich!" •
They had found borax. The mine
was sold for $20,000, and Winters took
his Itosie to a ranch in Nevada.
Slandered Into It.

When Children Smoked.
Jorevln de Rochefort, who published
in Paris In IC7I an account of his trav
els in England, 'tells the following:
"While we were walking about the
town (Worcester) he asked me If It was
the custom In France as hi England
that when the children went to school
they carried in their satchel with their
books a pipe of tobacco, which their
mothers took care to fill early In the
morning, it serving them Instead of
breakfast, and that at the accustomed
hour every one laid aside his book to
light his pipe, the master smoking with
them and teaching them how to hold
their pipes and draw in the tobacco."
In England at the time of the great
plague It was reported that no one liv
ing in a tobacconist's house fell sick of
the disease. This caused a great de
mand for tobacco. Hearne says In his
diary, "I remember that I heard for
merly Tom Rogers, who was yeoman
beadle, say that when he was a school
boy at Eton that year when the plague
raged all the boys of that school were
obliged to smoke every morning and
that he was never whipped so much In
his life as he was one morning for not
smoking."

THOSE FEES FOR LEGAL SER-
We have taken the trouble to ex
amine more closely into the matter
of the claims of W. J. McGee, as
special counsel in the case of Thomas
Conlon, trustee, et al, vs. C. L. Cul
bert, county auditor. It will be re
membered that mandamus proceed
ings were started to compel the
county auditor to add such an
amount to the tax levy for school
purposes as would, when added to
the levy already made by the board,
make up the sum of $6 per census
child. The further we look into
. this affair, the more its remarkable
and peculiar features come to the
front. Indeed, the whole history of
the case serves to show how uncere
moniously the provisions of law are
ignored by officers whose duty it is
to see that they are respected. Tbe
mandamus suit was commenced in
the superior court September 29,
1899. The district attorney is the
legal adviser of all county officials,
and it is his business to defend all
suits in which the county is made a
party, and wherein county money is
involved. The district attorney,
however, says he was not consulted
on the subject of taking charge of
this case. The auditor, seemingly
on his own motion and without first
securing the sanction of the board
of supervisors, employed W. J. Mc-
Gee to represent him in the action.
There was no time of course, to ap
peal to the supervisors for a special
attorney before the superior court.
It would seem to us therefore the
auditor in employing other than the
district attorney, assumed the re
sponsibility for the payment of
special counsel himself. It certainly
cannot be contended that any coun
ty officer may hire any attorney
whom he pleases, and shoulder the
payment of his fee upon the public
treasury. In October, 1899, the
writ of mandate was dismissed by
the superior court, the auditor
thereby winning the suit. Then
followed a long pause in the pro
ceedings. Nothing more was heard
of the case until April, 1900, when
the following bill was presented to
the board of supervisors by Mr.
McGee:
To legal services rendered
and expenses incurred in Jack
son school district vs. C. L.
Culbert, auditor — superior and
supreme courts $ 200 00
<. Money paid in above case to as
sistant counsel 50 00
This is the first intimation con
veyed to the board of supervisors, so
far as we caa ascertain from the
minutes that such a case was pend
ing against the county. No steps
had been taken to appeal the suit to
the supreme court. No sanction of
the employment of special counsel
had been made by the supervisors up
to this time. Mr. McGee was about
to start for a tour of Europe. Of
course no services had been render
ed in the supreme court, because the
suit had not reached that tribunal.
The only way we can understand
this is that the higher court was in
cluded, so that in case an appeal
was taken the fee was to be inclusive
of services in that court also. The
district attorney — who by the way
did not indorse this first bill as a
legal claim — says this was his clear
understanding of the matter at that
time. The bill was passed by unani
mous vote of the board. Nothing
further was heard of the case until
February 5, 1901, when C. L. Cul
bert, as county auditor, notified the
board that he had employed Mr.
McGree to represent him in the case;
and that plaintiffs having appealed,
he had requested Mr. McGee to rep
resent him in the higher court, and
asked the supervisors to ratify his
action in the employment of Mr.
McGee, so that the county would be
responsible for his fee. From this
we are forced to the conclusion that
although a fee of $250 for services in
superior and supreme courts had
been paid ten months before, there
had been no employment of a special
attorney by the county up to this
time. It is difficult to understand
what fee the county was asked to be
come responsible for. Was it the
one already irregularly paid, or one
to be demanded thereafter? No
wonder that first bill lacked the en
dorsement of the district attorney
as a legal claim. The board, how
ever, without a dissenting voice,
ratified the action of the auditor in
his selection of counsel outside of the
district attorney. £, . -^
: The next heard of the matter was
in June, 1901, when Mr. McGee ap
peared before the board and report
ed that be had argued the case before
the supreme court on the 15th of
The final step was referred to last
week, when the second bill of $500
for services in tbe supreme court —
already specified and paid for before
hand in the first bill — was presented
and allowed.
Tn regard to this claim- we have
been informed by the district at
torney that he told. the board of
ficially and privately that it was an
improper demand, and should not be
allowed.
We cheerfulty give place to the
communication of Mr. McGee which
appears in another column, and
which presents his version of the
matter. We can see nothing there
in to cause us to modify our views
already expressed. We are as much
in the dark as ever regarding the
payment of a fee both before and
after employment by the county.
We cannot understand what services
were rendered for the respondent
in the supreme court prior to April,
1900, when the supervisors were not
notified that an appeal had been
taken until February, 1901. We fail
to see that a special attorney, even
when regulary employed by a coun
ty, has any authority by virtue of
such employment to hire additional
counsel, and thereby saddle an ad
ditional fee upon the public treas
ury. We have failed to mention a
number of the sidelights referred to
by our correspondent, for the reason
that in our opinion they are not
material to the issue. Finally, we
may remark, that from beginning to
end of this school tax case one all
important fact seems to have been
overlooked by all the parties who
aided in piling up this double
shotted cost bill for legal services —
namely, that Amador county em
ploys a district attorney at $1800 per
year to look after its legal business.
Tf this one living fact is indelibly
impressed upon tbe minds of county
officials for their future guidance,
this ventilation of an unpleasant
subject will not have been in vain
Richahd Webb volunteers the
statement that at the age of sixteen
years he was ordained as a preacher.
— Dispatch.
Our cotemporary seems to be so
constituted tnat he cannot tell the
truth. The above contains two bare
faced falsehoods. We defy him to
produce any statement made in the
Ledger that will sustain his prevert
ed assertion. In the first place we
never volunteered any statemeut on
the subject. If the truth-inflationist
of the Dispatch does not know the
difference between an ordained and
unordained preacher, he had better
quit airing his ignorance. The ef
fect of misrepresentation is equally
bad whether it springs from ignor
ance or depravity. But when, as in
the above instance, the truth is
placed before him, and he wilfully
distorts it into a lie, he thereby
brands himself as a moral outlaw.
The lone board of trade is agi
tating for the appointment of a
health officer for lone. Just why
lone is entitled to a health officer
more than any other town in the
county does not appear. If the val
ley town needs a special officer to
look after its sanitary affairs at the
expense of the entire county, the
board of supervisors would be in
justice bound to grant the same pro
tection to at least five other towns,
namely, Jackson, Sutter Creek,
Amador City, Plymouth and Vol
cano. That method of trying to
scatter health germs — or dissipate
disease germs — has been tried and
voted a dismal failure. The truth
is there is no law authorizing the
board of supervisors to appoint a
health officer for any particular
town, in the absence of a general
health officer for the county. With
a county health officer, assistants
might in cases of emergency be ap
pointed at various points, but not
otherwise.
$250 00
The vagrancy law, in its most
objectionable features at least, has
been declared unconstitutional. The
idea that a man who is found roam
ing from place to place, and having
no visible means of support, is a
proper subject to be landed in jail,
has proved a lucrative proposition
for constables and justices, and a
costly one for many county treas
uries. To be an idle roamer is not
a very honorable profession, but it
is not in itself a criminal one. It
is a source of satisfaction that this
odious law, so out of joint with the
spirit of our free institutions, has
been knocked out by the courts.

THE AMAT>OR LEDGER: JACKSON » uAIiTTORNIA. TTtIPAY, FEBRUARYS 14, 1902.
COMMUNICATION
Jackson, Cal., Feb.- 8, 1902.
,To the editor of the Amador Ledgor,
Sir:— . .- . "
.. In the .issue of your paper of
February 7th you do the board of
supervisors and myself an injustice,
and in your article entitled "Claim for
Legal Services," you did not fully and
fairly publish the true facts.
The first claim presented on April 2,
1900, for $250, was for legal* servicos
rendered, expenses Incurred, and
money paid associate counsel up to that
date. These sorvices included the trial
of the case in the superior court, and
some preliminary services in the su
preme court, and also expenses incurred
in a trip from Jackson to San Fran
cisco. All I individually reseived out
of this $250 was about $150. There
after the case went through the su
preme court, covering a period of
nearly two years, and a subsequent
bill of $500 was presented for services
rendered from April 2, 1900, up to the
decision of the case, to wit, the latter
part of 1901. , ■. ;i
You failed to state in your article
that W. Q. Willis of the law firm "of
Freeman & Willis, who were attorneys
for tho school districts, testified before
the board that under the contract thoy
had the firm of Freeman & Willis
would have received from their clients
the sum of $1500 had they won tho case.
You also failed to state that the board
of supervisors called^n Hon. John F.
Davis and Hon. A. Caminetti, and
asked them if in their judgment the
charge was a fair one, and they both
replied in the affirmative. You also
failed to state that the reason of the
offer on my part to defend other suits
growing out of the same matter free of
charge was because Judge Davis sug
gested to the board that it was barely
possible another suit might be brought,
and although the attorneys for tho
school districts said that thb matter
was ended, at the request of the board
I agreed to make no further charges if
there was any further litigation.
You also failed to state that the Dis
trict Attorney was present throughout
tho hearing, and that before tlio board
passed the claim they asked his advice
on the same.
You also failed to slate that in ex
planation of the employment of assist
ant counsel by myself I was authorized
so to do. by Supervisors Dwyer and
Brinn.
You intimate in your article that
when the first bill was rendered it was
"supposed" to be in full, and yet the
bill as published by you shows on its
face that it was for services and ex
penses up to that time, to wit, April 2,
1900, as the wording of the bi'l is— "To
services rendered and expenses in
curred. "' You say, "there is nothing
in the bill to show that it is merely a
partial settlement;" I submit there, is
nothing in the bill to indicate that it
was to cover future services and ex
penses. * Both bills were fully explained
to the board at the meetings in Decem
ber, January, and February, and the
board had the latter bill under consid
eration for three months, and under
stood it thoroughly, and knew the* bill
was withdrawn in December and Jan
uary under the statement that it would
be presented again. The bill was with
drawn by me to avoid its being laid
over at" the December and January
meetings, the board being desirous of
further time to consider it.
You pay that apparently the same
ground was covered by both claims,
but in this you are mistaken as previ
ously shown in this communication.
You say that the name of the special
counsel does not appear on the bill, but
I repeatedly stated his name — Mr. F.
S. Brittain, attorney for the Hibernia
Savings and Loan Society of San Fran
cisco—to the board, and, if I mistake
not, in your presence.
Finally you fail to state in explana
tion of the claim that the litigation in
volved a large amount of money, em
bracing for the three years nearly $20-,
000, which was saved to the taxpayers
of the county, and when the case was
in the supreme court I agreed with tho
supervisors that if the school districts
won tho case I would make no charge
for my services in the supremo court,
but, if on the other hand, the suit was
decided in favor of the Auditor, I would
ask for a fair fee.
You intimate that the warrant was
cashed at once because I was fearful
some one would protest against its pay
ment, but in answer to this let me say
that if you or any other taxpayer want
to contest the payment at your own ex
pense and not at the county's I will
freely return tho money to tho treas
urer so that you may havo an oppor
tunity to do.so.
Very respectfully yours,
Wm. J. McGee.

District ' Attorney's Opinion.
The district attorney has, at the re
quest, of C. L. Culbert, county clerk,
given the following opinion in writing
in reference to certain points raised by
the calling of a special election in Sut
ter Creek to vote on the question of in
corporation. The gist of the opinion
is stated as follows:
Any person may vote at said election,
whose name appears upon the great
register used at the last general elec
tion, and all persons who have resided
in the state one year, in the county 90
days and within the"exterior boundaries
of tho proposed corporation for 30 days
next preceding the date of said election
and who have been enrolled upon tbe
new register now in progress, 15 days
before election.
The more fact that the board of
supervisors canceled tho great registor
used at the last goneral election does
not cancel it; whore a new registration
pursuant to law is not completed in
point of timo sulliciont to permit of its
use at a special election or the next en
suing election, then tho registor used
at the' last general election in any coun
ty in the state may be used.
' The clerk must, before the day of
election, transmit and cause to bo de
livered to tho board of election in each
precinct, a book of registration which
shall constitute the register to bo used
at such election; ho shall also cause to
be delivered at the same time fi vo copies
of the index to said book.
There is ample timo for every person
who desires to voto at said election to
bocorao enrolled upon the new register,
who is not enrolled upon the old reg
ister, as you terra it, and I hereby ad
vise you that it is your duty to post
notices of the purport of this opinion
in the town of Setter Creek, and ap
point sutlicient deputies in said town so
that each and every porson residing
thoreiu may bee jme enrolled upon the
register, and which will enable thorn to
vote at said election.
Respectfully submitted.

The estate of John Eagon, which has
been pending in the superior court of
this county for nearly 10 years, was
finally closed yesterday. The delay
was caused mainly by the difficulty in
settling up some real estate matter con
nected with the estate; and also because
Judge Rust, being a partner of the de

lected by the governor to settle the
affairs of the estate.

Julius, the oldest son of E. S. Pitois,
started out last week to carve his own
way in the world. He is sixteen years
of age, and has helped his father in
bis work for several years. Latterly,
however, the notion that he could do
butler for himself by striking out an
independent course has taken a strong
hold upon him. He did not run away
from home, as some boys foolishly do
when the idea of being self-supporting
seizes them. But he communicated
his wishes to his father, and he thought,
all things considered, that it would be
bettor for the boy to carry out his
plans. So Wednesday of last week he
left the parental roof with a small
bundle of his belongings. He made
his way to Sacramento county, and a
few days after his father received a
letter from him stating that he was at
Mills station, and had secured employ
ment at a farmer's place there, and ex
pected to get $10 per month and board,
and was perfectly' contented with his
prospects.
Wedding Bells.
At nine o'clock last Sunday morning,
in tho Catholic church of Jackson,
Amadeo A. Massa and Miss Mary J.
Ratto were united in matrimonial
bonds, the Rev. J. J. Gleason officiat
ing. The bride, richly attired in white
satin, was attended by Miss Jennie
Ratto, sister of the bride, as brides
maid, who was prettily dressed in pale
blue organdie. Antone Massa, brother
of the groom, acted as best man.
Immediately after the ceremony the
newly married couple repaired to the
residence of the bride's parents, Mr.
and Mrs. M. Ratto of Jackson Gate,
and partook of the wedding breakfast.
Shortly after twelve the happy pair
departed for lone, and remained there
that night. The following morning
they took tho train for San Francisco,
and will also visit other places of
interest. After their honeymoon they
will return to Jackson Gate, where
they will make their future home.
A Successful Event.
Notiwthstanding the inclemency of
the weather, the fireman's ball held in
Jackson Friday evening, February 7,
was well attended by people from the
various towns of the county. The San
Andreas orchestra played in its usual
excellent style, affording entire satis
faction to both dancers and spectators.
Tho grand march, led by U. G. D.
Spagnoli and Miss Amolia Cademartori,
began at 9:30. At midnight the merry
makers repaired to the Central and
Louvre restaurants to partake of the
good supper served at either place.
The dance lasted until half past three.
Many of our prominent firemen were
present. The ball was the event of the
season, and .an entire success both
socially and financially, due very largely
in both cases, to the untiring efforts of
some of the firemen's wives.
Three Years For Aldrich.
W. F. Aldrich, the young man who
in November last uttered, published,
and attempted to pass a forged check
on F. M. Jones of this city, was ar
raigned before Judge Shields, acting
for Judge Hart, entered a plea of guilty
to the charge, waived time, and was
sentenced to servo three years in tho
state prison at Folsom.
Aldrich raised $25 on a bogus check
on tho National Bank of D. O. Mills &
Co., for the purpose of gambling, as he
afterward confessed. He lost the sum
and asked for an additional $25. The
district attorney made a plea for
leniency, which accounts for the light
sentence imposed. — Record Union.
Aldrich was arrested in Jackson two
weeks ago on tho above charge. Ho
had been in this town since November,
his occupation being principally
gambling.

been the coldest known in years.
Water in watering troughs has been
frozen to a depth of from 4 to 8 inches.

An unknown man came near being
cremated one night last week at Camp
Contreras. He had been drinking dur
ing the day, and at night went to bed
in the old Duncan Robinson bouse.
About 9 o'clock a fire was seen biasing
through the windows by Mrs. Bel
derin, who notified her husband.
Belderein ran to the building and dis
covered the bed on fire where the fel
low lay. He pulled the sleeper out
just in time, for had he remained on
the bed another minute he would have
been burned to a crisp. As it was he
was well scorched. •

A Grand Serenade.
At 9 o'clock Monday evening a well
organized crowd, armed with all the
various instruments for creating a
racket that the ingenious Jacksonite
could conceive, ranging from horse
fiddles to cowbells, assembled at the
residence of Mr. and Mrs. C. C.
Glnocchlo, and headed by the Jackson
band, proceeded in silence under the
guidance of grand marshal O. H.
Reichling, aided by Capt. Freeman and
C. B. Arditto, to a position immediate
ly in front of the Chicago House on
Broadway, the temporary residence of
P. L. Cassinelli and wife. At a signal
from the marshal the din began, sur
passing anything in our history. A
passing celestial remarked that even
China New Year "isn't in it." When
the noise had subsided Pete gave a
smiling welcome to all his friends, and
to the ladies a more emphatic demon
stration of his good will. The bride,
charming as ever, acted her part well,
and nothing was left undone. Re
fresh monts were sorved in royal style.
Sandy (Mr. Greenhalgh) proposed a
toast, tho band played several approp
riate selections, more refreshments
were served, and the crowd departed,
wishing the bride and groom a long
life of happiness and prosperity.
Republican Club Meeting.
The regular meeting of the Jackson
republican club was hold last Monday,
about 15 members being present. A
committee consisting of two members
from each precinct in Jackson, was ap
pointed to look after the registration
of republican voters in their respective
precincts. The object is to see that
every person entitled to vole is not only
registered, but registered in his right
ful precinct.
A committee of three was also ap
pointed to draw up and forward to
Governor Gago a resolution expressing
the thanks of tho club at the appoint
ment of C. A. Herrick, president of
the club, as a member of the state
board of dental examiners.
A communication was read concern
ing the forthcoming convention of re
publican clubs to meet in San Jose in
April next. At the next meeting of
the local club, the delegates to attend
this convention will bo elected. The
club is entitled to send nine or ten
delegates.
It was resolved to have another
smoker at the next regular meeting of
the club, on the second Monday in
March. The members will be notified
of this gathering by postal card. A
full attendance on this occasion is
especially requested.
That Pipe Line.
At a meeting held In lone last week
it was decided to oppose the dismantling
of the plant for sprinkling the lone
road, and selling the pipe and water
tanks. What use is the material where
it lies? Was the experience of last
season in the sprinkling business of
such a character as to justify its con
tinuance at public expense next sum
mer? If the pipe remains where it is,
it will be fit for nothing but junk in
another year or so. The money that
might be realized from it now might be
of some service in the permanont im
provement of the roadway. The pipe
and sprinkling plant belong to Amador
county. The fact that privato citizens
contributed toward the purchase does
not change the ownership, nor give the
contributors any more say in its dis
posal than any other taxpayers. The
board of supervisors ought to take
some action. To allow it to rot in the
ground is anything but a business
proposition.

DOCTORS AT VARIANCE
As to the Character of a
Disease in Sutter Creek.
It is Pronounced Smallpox by Some.
The State Board of Health Called
Upon to Decide.
Sutter Creek has been shaken up and
greatly agitated for several days
touching the charactor of an eruptive
disease which has been epidemic in that
town for several weeks. The mildness
of the disease has boon tho moans of
allaying apprehension. Children have
been running around and attending
school with their faces covered with
blotches. The result Is that the
disease— which, whether smallpox or
not, is certainly of a highly contagious
nature— has had a free field in which
to spread. It is estimated that at least
25 cases exist in our sister town. It
has obtained headway in exactly the
same way as the outbreak in Jackson
about two years ago. The symptoms
had certain well-defined characteristics
of smallpox, but then again those
afflicted felt little the worse for the
disease, attending school and joining in
play as usual, so that the people were
naturally loath to believe that the
much dreaded smallpox had taken
quarters in their midst. The local
physicians, who were attending the
patients, were opposed to that opinion.
District Attorney Vicini was in Sut
ter Creek Tuesday afternoon, and the
prevalence of the malady was brought
to his attention. By this time several
adults were Buffering from the com
plaint, including Mrs. Morris, who suc
ceeded to Mrs. Mails' business, and a
Mrs. Williams. Tho district attorney
thereupon called upon Dr. Lewis, who
was the attending physician in most of
the cases, and told him of the reports
that were afloat. It was then decided
to send for Dr. Gall of Jackson, who
had much experience in such cases dur
ing the outbreak here. He went over
to Sutter Crook, and upon visiting one
of the cases, unhesitatingly pronounced
it smallpox— the same that prevailed
at the county seat two years ago. Still
the local doctors would not accept this
verdict, Dr. Goodman strongly pro
testing against such a diagnosis.
Dr. E. E. Endicott, who was health
officer when the county seat was visited,
was summoned, and he said it was
smallpox.
The judgment of two physicians who
had passed through the ordeal at the
county seat, ought to have settled the
question, but it did not.
Finally the district attorney docided
to appeal to tho state authorities. He
called up W. P. Matthews, secretary of
the stale board of health, and request
ed that a medical officer of tho state be
sent to Sutter Creek to determine the
nature of the outbreak. He was ex
pected to arrive in Suttor Creek last
night. His verdict will bo taken as de
cisive. In the meantime, no rigid
quarantine was established. The pre
caution was taken to prevent thoso suf
fering from the eruption from attend
ing school; Mrs. Morris' business was
closed temporarily, but no guards were
appointed to watch tho infected places.
Tho laundry wagons from Sutter
Creek visit the neighboring towns de
livering and gathering up clothing the
same as usual.
The prevailing opinion of those who
have had experience in such cases, is
that a mild type of smallpox — such as
has appeared more or less in almos t
every part of the state— exists in Sut
ter Creek. Nearly all the casos are
simple and comparitivcly harmless
types of varioloid. Two casos of con
fluent smallpox are said to exist. There
is no need to be alarmed, however.
With ordinary precautions, the epi
demic will soon disappear, as it has in
every place as soon as protective
measures have been taken. The cir
cumstances do not call for any harsh
or severe restrictive methods against
the afflicted town. We have been in
the same predicament not so long ago,
and while it is" wise to -take all reason
able precautions to guard against ex
posure, still there is not the slightest
necessity for the interruption of every
day business relations with Sutter
Creek.
Dr. Hanna, of Sacramento, a repre
sentative of tho state board of heath,
arrived in Sutter Creek last night, and
pronounced the disease smallpox. This
is decisive of the whole matter. An
effectivo quarantine has been estab
lished, and everything done to confine
the contagion within its present limits. 1 '
The fling at the Jackson doctors con
tained in .the Amador Record is very
untimely and uncalled-for. The county
seat physicians have learned to know
smallpox when they soe it. Sutter
Creek medicos will probably know it
hereafter.
Big Landslide.
A bad break occurred on the line of
the old canal below the Petty reservoir
last Sunday. The managers started
to fill the new reservoir, known as the
Petty reservoir. This is a small affair,
compared with the Taboaud reservoir,
being 1000 feet long, 60 feet wide, and
15 feet deep. The work of filling an
earth reservoir has to bo vory care
fully and gradually done. Seepage
and breaks incident thereto are not
uncommon occurrences in connection
with now reservoirs, and it is usual to
raise tho water very gradually at first
to guard against those mishaps. Tho
banks of the reservoir at Petty did not
give way in any place, but the seepage
therefrom weakened a portion of the
old Amador canal below, filling it up
for a distance of 60 feet and also causing
quite a break. A force of men was at
work Sunday night repairing, and also
during Monday. The eloctric lights
were shut off about 8 o'clock Monday
morning, but Monday night every
thing was in running ordor again.

MINING NEWB.
Kirkwood. — Last evening a meeting
of those interested in the Kirkwood
mine was held In Judge Davis' office,
when all obstacles in the way of the re
sumption of work were overcome.
Papers wore drawn up giving the com
pany a five years' bond, and also the
mineral right to additional ground on
the west. Also an ironclad pooling ar
rangement was entered into binding
the promoters not to enter into any ar
rangement that would benefit them
selves until all the other subscribers
have received their stock. New life
has been Infused into the company,
and operations will start up in a few
Kennedy.— While in Washington
recently Senator John F. Davis suc
ceeded in getting the land office author
ities to advance the hearing on the un
patented portion of the Clyde quartz
mine, which is owned by the Kennedy
Company, and is a part of the mine
now being worked. The application
for patent has been held up In the land
office since 1873. Last weeks instruc
tions were sent to the Sacramento
land office to receive the entry money
and issue the receipt. This practically
settles the controversy, as there Is now
no conflict of interest between the
placer and quartz claimants, which
was the original cause of the delay.
AMADOR CITY.
The following item was received
from our correspondent too late for
last weeks' issue:
Stillman F. Kelley of Boston, the
managing spirit of the South Spring
Hill, paid our little town a visit in the
interest of the company. If Mr.
Kelley has his way, the mine will be
reopened and equipped equal to any
mine in the county. The majority of
the company are financially well able
to do this, and Mr. Kelley has paid the
mine a visit in their interest. Supt.
Tregloan has been trying to get them
to come out for over a year. While
here he visited the principal mines in
the county.
Mr. Charles Gerard of San Jose, has
accepted the position of principal in
our school.
Mrs. Blair left Tuesday tor a visit
with her parents at Mariposa.
The memorial service for the late
Rev. Jab. Jeffery was held .Sunday
evening in the M. E. church, and was
conducted by "Mr. Burchett. The A.
O. F. order, of which Mr. Jeffery was
a faithful member, attended church in
a body.
A shadow of gloom was spread over
our town last Saturday evening when
tho very sad news came telling of the
death of W. H. Coleman,- formerly
principal of our school. When he re
turned, after spending the holidays
at his home in Gilroy, his health was
quite poorly. However, he succeeded
in teaching a week, but finally had to
give up entirely. . He was 6ick here
for two weeks, and as ho continued to
fail he decided to go home, which he
did two weeks ago Tuesday. He
breathed his last on B'riday morning,
and was buried at Gilroy on Sunday.
Mr. Coleman was highly esteemed by
all with whom he came in contact, and
the trustees of the public school, in
order to aid him to retain his position,
closed his room for a week, and hired
a substitute for two weeks longer. Mr.
Coleman, as a teacher, had won the
love of all his students, for whom he
often inconvenienced himself, and many
tears were shed when they heard the
sad news. The pupils of his room im
mediately draped his desk with beau
tiful flowers, and the trustees ordered
the flag over the school building. to be
half-masted for thirty days.
PINE GROVE.
On Tuesday, February 3, a literary
and debating society was organized by
the young folks of this burg. The of
ficers elected are as follows: President,
H. Griffin; Vice Pres., Miss Lillis A.
Bradshaw; Secretary, Miss Barstow;
Treasurer, Chas. Ludekens. The first
debate was held last Tuesday, the sub
ject being, "Resolved, that woman
exerts a greater influence as a civilizing
agent than man." The affirmative
side was presented by W. Wilson and
Lottie Luttrell, and the negative by
Miss Lillis Bradshaw and A. Jones.
The meetings are held in the church,
although the society itself is non
sectarian. These meetings are likely
to prove not only Interesting, but in
structive and profitable. They are
just what is needed in a small village
community, and tend to promote soci
ability and develop the literary and
oratorical powers of the members.
A valuable horse belonging to W.
W. Stewart fell into a prospect bole
about 12 feet deep while running on

prompt assistance of neighbors, the
horse, after considerable trouble, was
extricated without serious Injury.
A child of R. Luttrell has been
dangerously sick with pneumonia, but
is now pronounced out of danger.
Mrs. Hammond and daughter from
Idaho, are visiting near Pine Grove,

In Memoriam.
Miss S. M. Page was born in Liver
pool, England, September 19, 1828, and
died at the home of her daughter, Mrs.
Augusta Fleming, in Jackson, Feb
ruary 9, 1902. The subject of this
notice spent most of her girlhood days
in London, England. At 18 years of
age she came to America in a sailing
vessel. The journey was accomplished
in about 6 months' time. She came by
the way of the Gulf of Mexico to New
Orleans, and then up the Mississippi
river to St. Louis. In 1858 she, in
company with others, crossed the
western plains and located at Virginia
City, Nevada. Five months' time was
consumed in this overland ox-team
route. Indians were numerous and
hostile at this time in the different sec
tions through which these emigrants
were obliged to travel. After 4 years'
sojourn in Virginia City, she moved to
California and lived for the most part
in Sacramento, Tuolumne, Alpine and
Amador counties. In the year 1850,
she married John F. Davis, who died
in 1864. By this union one son, who
died in childhood, and one daughter,
Mrs. A. Fleming of Jackson, were born'
unto them. Sho married her second
husband, Tom Bastian, brother of
James B. Bastian of Amador City, in
1868. He was accidentally killed after
scarcely one year of a happy married
life. She married John Nightingale
in 1873, who died July 4, 1892. Among
those who mourn her demise are her
daughter and family, Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Fleming and grand-daughter
Eileen Fleming, of Jackson; also her
stepchildren, Mrs. Susana Perry and
Mrs. Mary E. Sperry of Stockton, and
Mr. M. J. Nightingale of Oakdale, Cal.
At the age of 12 Mrs. Nightingale
gave her heart to God, and since that
time has beon a firm and devout be
liever in salvation through Jesus Christ.
Her benevolent heart sympathized with
and her willing hands were extended
in aid to the suffering and destitute.
Want went smiling from her door. She
sacrificed her owa comforts in order to
aid others whom she felt were less
fortunate than herself. Her interest
and devotion in her own family circle
was beautiful and wholesome. The
spirit of the Master was practically
demonstrated in her life work. In her
last sickness she was a great sufferer.
She felt that if it was God's will, she
would like to enter her heavenly home.
"I have a desire to depart and to be
withiChrist, which is far better." She
said to her daughter, whose gentle
ministrations were in abundance, ' 'You
are praying that I may get well. Pray
that I may pass away and be at rest. ' '
Notwithstanding the efforts of trained
nurses, and skillful physicians, and the
ministrations of friends, she quietly
and peacefully passed to the inner cir
cle of loved ones gone before.

A TRIP TO ALASKA.
Going Through the Ice.
On the 15th of June, 1901, the S. S.
Valencia steamed put of Unalaska har
bor for the north. For one week prior
thereto, we had laid still at the wharf
at the aforementioned place, as the in
surance companies in which the Va
lencia and her cargo were insured had
forbidden in their stipulations for the
boat to proceed northward before the
15th of June as a precaution against
the danger of the ice they knew full
well would be ahead. For one day and
night after leaving Unalaska we
steamed through the cold, blue, Iceless
sea that dashed with a continuous
splashing sound against the iron sides
of the Valencia. Not an object of in
terest had we seen up to this time, and
only the broad expanse of a restless
ocean standing out with dull monotony
before our view. Occasionally a whale
would send a shaft of spouting water
far Into the air, and all eyes would be.
turned in that direction. Only a
glimpse of the whale could be seen as
he threw his tall upward and dived
beneath the dark blue waves of the sea,
and was seen no more. The tireless
seagull followed the vessel continually,
feeding from the garbage thrown from
the vessel; and when tired they lit with
half folded wings upon the crest of a
rolling wave, touching the water with
their feet and seemed .to be walking
upon it, then suddenly their wings
would drop to their sides and with the
lightness and ease of a cork in a pail of
disturbed well water would be carried
along by the waves. '";-". ~
On the 17th of June, just as the - sun
was rising through the cold dim mist
that hung like a shadow before it, I
came out on deck and looked toward
the north. A sea of floating ice stood
before the vision. A solitary iceberg,
half as big as a block in a city, glided,
suail like, a few hundred feet past us.
A cerulean tint of azury blue appeared
to be painted at its base, and as the sea
gently dashed upon it, seemed that
some invisible artist was painting upon
it for the gaze of the gods. The cor
rugated surface of the iceberg sparkled
with the glitter of a diadem, and sent
a thrill of ecstatic delight through me.
The Valencia was slowly approaching
the great ice floe ahead. I climbed up
behind the smoke stack to get a better
view of the immensity of ice that stood
like a great ocean itself before us. Ice!
ice! ice! masses large enough in body to
have acted as a base for the city of San
Francisco. The ocean was calm and
the great mass moved slowly onward,
bobbing, nodding, and bathing itself
in the cold blue waves of the rippling
sea. Upon its uneven surface seemed
to spring spires, domes, pyramids,
turrets, and ancient citadels. The
captain in the lookout 60 or 80 feet
above us was critically surveying the
sea of floating ice with his glass. The
Valencia steamed up within a half
mile of the floe when her engines were
stopped, and we awaited the floe to
show an opening. We dare, not ap
proach too close lost the great mass
might jam or wrench the vessel. The
trip to the Valencia was not a new one
as she belonged to the Pacific Whaling
Company and had faced the ice more
than once before. After an hour or so
a break appeared in the ice, and be
yond it was a space of open sea. The
engines on the vessel were started up,
and we ran at full speed for the open
ing. Detached pieces of ice occasionally
struck the vessel with a rasping, grat
ing sound, then thrown back by the
momentum of the vessel, moved on
ward after the great floo as a weary
migratory bird following a great flock.
Wo again stopped, after passing
through the opening, for beyond us
was another great body of moving ice.
The captain was cautious and wary,
and watched with solicitude and eager
ness as a prize fighter would for an
opening, and whenever one showed
itself the engines were put at full speed,
dodging here and there among the
great detached floating icebergs of the
sea. Therefore we stopped, we moved,
we moved, and we stopped until the
impatient passengers were eager for
the boat to buck the ice. One day
while waiting for a chance to proceed,
a little boy of 5 or 6 summers ap
proached the captain, and raising his
little face to that of the officer's, said
in an emphatic, boyish tone: "Captain,
are we stuck in the mud?" Had the
interlocutor been aught but a child or
a woman he would have turned upon
him with a snarl, and shouted in
stentorian tones, "Go to " but as
it was he turned, and with a bland
smile walked slowly away. One day
while lying still off the coast of St.
Lawrence island, some one shouted,
"See the Esquimaux!" Sure enough,
two Esquimaux Indians in their deli
cate cigar shaped kiacks were coming
toward us. When they were close to
the vessel's side they halooed,
"Powder, whiskey," but the boat
officials concluded that powder and
whiskey were antagonistic agencies in
the hands of an Indian and refused
their request. On tho morning of the
19th of J uno the clear cut, blue out
lines of Sledge Island arose bold and
clear out of the ocean. The Ice was
now gone. The anvil mountains back
of Nome arose snow-capped in the dis
tance. The shore line, hazy and in
distinct, broke upon tho* vision cold
and dreary, and tho olty of Nome
seemed to be hiding behind the cold
misty haze that hovered o'er the city.
The whistle of the Valencia sounded,
the anchor dropped, and the tug
boats answering call told us our
journey was at an end. Two hours
afterward we were walking along the
muddy streets, among tho thousands
of strange faces we had nevor seen
before. Chas. S. Bell.

CAMP OPRA.
Report says that the Buena Vista
Copper Mining and Reduction Com
pany are now prepared to rush the
work of cleaning out the old-time shaft
on their property. It is thought by
those who are supposed to know, that
the work of cleaning out will take two
years at the present rate of progress.
However that may be, the company
offers good wages and a fine chance to
buy stock.
Mining and woodchopplng are im
portant branches of industry in this
part of Amador county at present.
Everything is looking fine here
abouts from the standpoint of agri
culture since the last rains.

A Fireman's Close Call.
"I stuck to my engine, although
every joint ached and every nerve was
racked with pain," writes C. W.
Bellamy, a locomotive fireman of Bur
lington, lowa. "I was weak and pale,
without any appetite and all run down.
As I was about to give up, I got a bot
tle of Electric Bitters and, after taking
it, I felt as well as I ever did in my
life." Weak, stokly, rundown people
always gain new life, strength and
vigor from their use. Try . them.

III* Foot Wai In the Way.
A gentlemanly chap riding* In an ele
vated j car permitted j the sight of . a
man's foot In the middle of the aisle to
exasperate him to a most unreasonable
degree. Women tripped over It.' Men
stepped over it. A few folk purposely
dragged their feet against It as a bint
But its owner calmly read his paper
and moved not. Finally, "1 beg your
pardon, my friend." said the gentleman
ly chap, leaning down, his face sot ami
teeth clinched, "but don't you think; }~ou
are taking up more room than you are
entitled to? Your foot has been In ev
ery one's \cay for half an hour. I pro
test, slrr*
The man folded his paper, remarking
without the least show of anger: "Ah,
thank you. I had not noticed It" With
that he reached down, picked up his
foot, gave It a violent twist and pushed
It partly under the seat To accomplish
this he had to move bis body to the
edge of the seat
On discovering that the leg and foot
were wooden our gentlemanlike chap
blushed In confusion, muttered a sort of
apology and hurried off at the next sta
tion, while the car tittered.— New York

Very Trying:.
. "Johnny," said a provincial grocer to
the new boy, "what kind of butter did
you send over to the Hendersons?"
"Some of the rolls here," said the new
boy respectfully.
"Oh, great Csesar!" groaned the gro
cer. "Sent 'em some of that good butter
Just after I have got 'em down to this
here in the barrel 1 Sent 'em the best
butter in the shop Just as I finish a two
years' course of getting 'em down to
the barrel butter! Gave 'em a taste of
good butter after I have got 'em to
think this barrel butter was the best in
the world! And still you say you hope
to own a grocer's shop some day! The
taste of that butter you sent 'em will
awaken all their old slumbering desires
for good butter, and I'll have to work
another two years getting 'em down a
little poorer each time before I get 'em
where there's any profit on 'em again!
You might Just as well put on your
coat and go. Groceries ain't your line!"

The Oldest Tree on Earth.
The oldest tree on earth, at least as
far as any one knows, Is the boo tree
In the sacred city of Amarapoora, Bur
ma. It was planted, the record says,
In the year 288 B. O. Its great age Is
proved according to historic docu
ments, says Sir James Emerson, who
adds: "To It kings have dedicated their
dominions in testimony of a belief that
it is a branch of the identical flg tree
under which Buddab reclined at Urum
elva when he underwent his apotheo
slsi" Its leaves are carried away by
pilgrims as relics; but, as it Is too sa
cred to touch with a knife, these leaves
can only be gathered after they have
fallen.
