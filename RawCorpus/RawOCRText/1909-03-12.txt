THE TRIAL OF
JACKSON DENNIS.
On Bank Embezzlement Case.
Tbo trial of Jaukaou Dennis, on a
charge of embezzling from tbe Sutter
Creek State Hmik the mini of 8500,
wiia commenned In tbe superior court
on Monday morning. A venire of 70
jurors waaualled from which to select
tbe jury. It waa at first reported that
Hiram Johnson, tbe well-known iittor
ney of Sau Franotaoo, was engaged to
conduct the case for tbe defendant.
This announcement, however, proved
premature. Mr Johnson did not ap
pear, and the defendant's attorneys
were Homer W. Wood of Sau Fran
oisco, and K. C. liolu of Jackson.
District attorney Viciui was alono on
the side of tbe prosecution.
It was anticipated owing to tbe
wide publicity of the bank failure,
aud so many persona interested there
in, tbe selection of a jury would
prove a long and tedious tusk, lint
tbe twelve impartial jurora were no
cured by tbe adjournmeuC of court
on Tuesday afternoon. Three per
emptory challenges were used by the
prosecution, und nix by tbe defense.
Only two or three were excused for
cause. Upon tbe complotiou of tbe
jury panel at half past four Tuesday,
the court adjourned until Wednesday
morning. The following named per
sons comprise the jury: James
Muahett, John Going, Ci. W. Smith,
Joseph Dufreue, J. 1). Carpenter, W.
H. Vela, Cnas. Boro, J. C. Clifton,
O. W. Kiuebart, K. -J. Dieold, S.
Bloom and J. 11. Wooltord. ,'•'
On Wednesday morning the taking
of testimony was commenced. After
showing tbe incorporation of tbe
bank and the election of Jackson
Dennis as president on July JO, 190U,
by the introduction of tbe articles ot
in'ooporation aud tbe entry in tbe
minute book,*
Fred Kabb was called. He testified
that on the '20th of July, 1906, be
signed a note for $500, made outin
lavor of defendant, in accordance
with ■ a previous arrangement. Do
fendant'eame to him a day or so be
fore, and wanted him to take five
shares ot stock iv the Sutter Creek
State IJiink. Ho told him be did not
want to buy stock; tha*: be bad no
money for that purpose. He was told
that he didn't have to pay tbe money,
that be could givo a note, aud if be
was not satislied at tbe expiration of
three months be could give back tbe
stock and take back tbe note. On that
understanding be signed the note,
and that the interest for three months
was credited on tbe note. There
was no money passed in this trans
action: but be received a certificate
of five shares ot stock from defendant.
Toward tbe close of 1907, be requested
Dennis to take tbe stock back, and
surrender tbe note; that it was draw
ing interest. Defendant replied that
be need not trouble himself about
interest, as be would see that no in
terest was charged up against him;
that it was a time of financial
stringency, aud be bad been unable
to plaoe stock, but wbeu tbe banks
re-opened he would be able to give
baok tbe note. On January 20, li'UH,
be bad another talk, in wbioh he said
be bad given back tbe stock to tbe
cashier, P. Daboviob, aud tbe note
waa roturned to him. There waa no
money passed at any time in con
nection with tbe trausaction.
Peter Daboviob. tbe cashier, was
then reoallod and testified sub
stantially that tbe note forSsoo signed
by Frod tiabb was placed iv tbo
bauk as au asset by defendaut, ou
July 22, IDOIi. As cashier he put tbe
bauk stamp on tbe hack of the note.
It waa nidoi'Nud by Jackaou Dennis.
The counter oasb book of tbe hank
waa shown to wHuokh aud recognized.
After considerable spurriug tbe vvit
uesa was permitted ; to testify In re
gard to tin outry made July JW, l'JUli.
He made the nutry ut deteudaut's
direction. On tbo -'-!, tbe note was
banded in as a loan, and tho amount
placed to credit of defendant's person
al account. Tbero waa nothing to
show that the hook waa the cash hook
of bank. Name of Sutter Creek State
IJank did not appear uuywhere upon
it. Finally the entry iv cash buok
was admitted iv ovideuce. It rend,
"July 22. Loauod Fred Kabb SIKH)."
A deposit slip or tag relating to this
transaction wua identified by wltueus.

in?. Did not remember teeing her
make entry, and did not know nt
whose request it waa made. Did not
know of defendant ever depositing
9500 on July 'A 1900, or at any otber
time.
Mies lloitann was tbe witness Thurs
day morning. Nbe waa the assistant
cashier from January, 1000, ■ to : Jan
uary '29. 11)08. Shown the ledger und
the page of oredlts and debits of
Jauksou Dennis, she caid nhe made
the entries therein. The page show
ed in pencil "ifIUG" written ut Mm
top, wbioh was not Iv her handwrit
ing. It was the oustom of : tbe bank
to enter credits and debits tbe morn
ing following tho deposits and pay
ment of checks from tbe deposit • 1 i pa
and checks. She could not tell Irom
tbo entries in the book in what year
they were made: but could determine!
date from tbe deposit slips,, and
checks. Tbo deposit slip were shown
witness, and ehe testitled that they
woro neither in her hand writing nor
that of tbo defendant. Tbo .deposit
tng9 were kept for reference as a pint
of rouords of hank. The deposit of
SSOO on July 22, IDO6, in favor of
defendant, waa credited in tbe 'ledger
to bia aocount July 21!.
A surprise ohiud yesterday atter
noon, when Dabovioh was oo' ] tbe
stnnd aud adding up the credits' and
debita ot defendant's account from
pages of tbe ledger shown him. The
result was a credit balance, in favor
of Dennis of 1707.07. .;'--..vV*l,i-.
It was afterwards discovered that
tbe witneaa was being examined from
the books of tbe old bank before it
was obanged to the Sutter Creek State
Bank. All the time consumed on this
matter was lost. The district attorney
moved to have all testimony relating
to the pagea of the private bank of
Jnckson Dennis stricken out, and it
was so ordered. Tbe testimony was
thereupon taken ou tbe correct ,page,
showing Jacksou Dennis account with
the Suttsr Creek State Bauk. "
The distriot attorney apologised to
tbe couit for this mistake in getting
in testimony, that had no bearing on
the oasa. Tbe blunder, notwithstand
ing the Meompetent matter' 'was
stricken from tbe record, .mixed up
thing in the minds of all who beard
it.
K. C. Bole !s conductiiiß tbe case
for defendant, lie objects to about
every question propounded, and
where the objeotion is overruled,
notes an exception.
This morning P. Dabovicb waa on
tbe stand, footing up tbe debits and
credits of defendant's account with
the bank, tbe object being to show
that defendant bad about exhausted
bis account at tbe time tbe bank was
closed, and thereby seeking to prove
that be had embezzled 8500 credited
to him on account of tbe note of
Fred Kabb, withdrawn from the hank
assets.
This morning P. Daboviuh footed
up tbe account of Dennis, with the
result tbat at the closing of the bank
there remained a balance of $30.47 to
the credit of defendant.
The case is not likely to be finished
this week.

MINING NOTES.
Argonaut. — It is understood that
affairs at this mine will be moving
apace ere long. A good deal of ma
chinery at the present shaft is to be
replaced by more powerful machinery.
Tbe air compressor ia to be replaced
by one of 150 horse power, and the
one now iv use moved to another por
tion of tbe claim, possibly for tbe
sinking of a shaft on tbe Hoffman
ground. JCngineera from tbe east
have been here for tie past two
weeks, busily engaged iv looking over
the'Jleld. to decide upon tbe future
operations. Everything indicates
lively times. It is reported that tbe
full milling capacity will be in opera
tion soon, aud the era of dividends
return to gladden the hearts of tbe
stockholders.
Original Amador.-At this mine at
Amador city machinery is being iu
stalled for tho purpose of putting tbe
property on a good working basis.
Nothing has beeu done as yet, in
uuderground mining, but the surface
works are being pushed abead .with
all possible speed to that end. Tbe
prevailing opiuion is that this mine
will develop iuto another dividend
payer. It is between two good pro
ducers, tbe Keystouo and liuuker
Hill. Tbo parties who are developing
it are conlldeut that the mineral
value ja witttin the claim to justify a
liberal expenditure of money to reach
it.

:.• Iv prewlnes fonnoriy ooouplod by
:Mux:J^udur, Juckbuu, Cal. , ■ ,HE DIDN'T VOTE.
The report of the proceedings of the city trustees at their
meeting last week, shows that trustee W. M. Penry sen. de
clined to vote on the letting of the contract for the city print
ing. This may shape itself to some minds as a commendable
act under the circumstances. To others, it will squint in an
entirely different direction. The question will be asked,
"Why did he not vote:" and it will be a difficult matter to
answer that query in a way that will reflect credit upon the
official refusing to vote. The Ledger believes that persons
holding a position of public trust, no matter whether it ba a
remunerative or unretnunerative office, should scrupulous
ly comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the law.
W. M. Penry, notwithstanding his published statement
when the city was incorporated, to the effect that he had
turned over the Dispatch to W. M. Penry, jun., in order as
he imagined to evade the law prohibiting city officials from
being interested in any contract with the city, or in the
furnishing of any supplies to the city, is to-day as he has
been all along the proprietor of the Amador Dispatch. There
has been no change of ownership. The first issue and the
last since the incorporation of Jackson shows the same
ownership. W. M. Penry jr. is posted in the Dispatch
columns as the editor, which by no means carries the idea
of proprietorship, and as a matter of fact is not used in any
such sense in this case.
Now here is the law governing contracts and furnishing
supplies to cities of the sixth class. It is clear cut. We
cannot conceive how anyone can misunderstand its terms:
886. No officer of such city or town shall be m
terested, directly or indirectly, in any contract with
such city or town, or with any of the officers there
of in their official capacity, or in doing any work or
furnishing any supplies for the use of such city or
town, or its officers in their official capscity; and
any claim . for compensation for work done, or
supplies or materials furnished in which any such
officer is interested, shall be void, and if audited
and allowed shall not be paid by the . Treasurer.
Any wilful violation of the provisions of this section
shall be a ground for removal from office, and shall
be deemed a misdemeanor, and punished as such.
Now Penry jr. fathered a bid of the Dispatch for. doing the
city printing. The Ledger also put % in a bid. These bids
are published at length in another column. We will not at
this time inquire in^to tne merits of the respective bids,, nor
the method by which the Dispatch was figured out to be the
lowest by five cents. We have no hesitation in saying the
•county printing under the Dispatch bid will cost scores of
dollars more in the course of a yearthan it would under the
Ledger schedule. But Peury, sen. thought it would be un
becoming on his part to vote on the question. Why. If it
was legal, there was certainly no harm in helping his own
son to secure a contract from the city. It cannot be assumed that
parental concern influenced him in dodging the question. If
the truth must be told, he was more anxious than the rest of
the trustees to have the contract awarded to the Dispatch,
and would no doubt have so voted if his vote had been neces
sary to that end. But he was the owner of the Dispatch
concern, and claimed to have no interest in the printing
contract. He doesn't according to his peculiar theory, get
any benefit from the business of the Dispatch. The increase
or curtailment of that business makes no difference to
him, notwithstanding that he is now and ever since has been,
to use the legal phase of his own adoption, the owner of the
plant and the appurtenances thereunto belonging.
The fact is the refusal to vote is in itself a dead give away.
He was conscious that he was the most interested party — not
merely indirectly but directly interested, and he thought to
tone down the affair to some extent by wiggling out of the
voting line, leaving his brother trustees to bear the burden
of the illegal act. There is no other reasonable interpre
tation. Furthermore, the opinion of the city attprney was
not asked on this proposition. It would seem that in a
matter involving both civil and criminal penalties the
written opinion of an attorney would be sought before com
mitting themselves to any doubtful proposition. The city
attorney was not present at the meeting of the board, and the
board concluded, although, as we are informed, the legal as
pect of the question was discussed, that the advice of their
own legal adviser was not wanted in this particular case.
These are the kind of breaks that bring local government
into contempt. The disregard of the plainest provisions
when self-interest is at stake, is among the greatest menaces
of our political system. The parties to the carrying out of
this scheme assume that the sum involved is not worth a
contest in the courts, that no one is going to spend his own
money for the maintenance of the sanctity of law. And
hence they imagine that after the first blush of shame, the
thing will be forgotton, and the booty will be diverted into
illegal channels according to programme.

BANK VAULTS.
Precautions Fop IH« Purpois of Foil-
ing the Cracksmen.
Mnny bunks, especially those in
cities, fmvn their vaults protected by
an elaborate nystem of concealed
wires connected to n centrnl ofllce not
so fnr nway, ro thnt tlie lcnst tnm
perlfyt wllh tho combination lock or
any attack upon the door or walls
will rlvo the nlnrm nt the central of
fice, where men nre waiting drty and
night to run to the rescue. The esnet
method and devices that are used nro
kept rather secret, for fenr the bur
glars themselves might learn too much
about them, but It mny be explained
that one part of the apparatus Is an
'extremely sensitive relay located nt
the central ofllce. This delicate In
strument closes n local circuit which
pounds the alarm the moment there
is the slightest disturbance of the hid
den wires nt nnd near the vault, so
that a gnng of burglars could hardly
get to work with their drills and their
nitroglyccrln before tho officers of the
law would be upon them.
In addition to protecting vaults and
safes from the direct nttacks of rob
bers, electricity affords another safe
guard by furnishing light which floods
the premises with Its searching beams.
Indeed, many bnnks, stores and ware
houses rely mainly upon the electric
light, without which the thickest walls
and the strongest and most compli
cated locks would be useless. They
turn it on at night nnd leave their
window shutters wide open, so thnt
the Interior may be in full view of
the policeman or watchman passing;
the windows all night. This makes it
practicafly Impossible for lawbreakers
to work unseen.
To protect the money windows of
banks the teller behind tho window
has a concealed push button at band,
oftentimes placed under the counter
where he can touch it unobserved. If
any one tries to steal nny money, the
teller can call an officer instantly in
this way. The circuit is sometimes ar
ranged to close the bank doors also by
an electrically operated mechanism be
fore the thief has time to get to them
and escape.— Harper's Weekly.
WHERE RICH MEN ARE FEW.
They Are as Scarce a« Black Swans
In Bulgaria.
Bulgaria is the nearest approach to
a peasant commonwealth which the
world ban known in modern times.
There Is not a Bulgarian Slav who is
not the owner of a plot of land upon
which he lives and out of which he
gets his own livelihood by his own
labor.
Large landowners nre almost un
known. The few men of wealth in
the country arc mostly of foreign birth
or descent, and even they would' not
be counted as wealthy according to
the standard of other European coun
tries.
The small landowners, who form the
vast majority of the population, are
peasant born and peasant bred. They
are extremely thrifty. They are con
tent with very plain food. They wear
the same sheepskin garments from
ye:ir to year, only turning their coats
Inside out with the changes of the
season.
Wholo families, even of well to do
peasants, sleep In the same room upon
mats stretched out on the floor. T'jey
live tinder conditions of dirt and dis
comfort which no British or. German
or French laborer would tolerate for
n week. Yet. notwithstanding their
disregard of the simplest sanitary ar
rangements, they grow up singularly
strong and healthy.
Moreover, they nre free from the ir
ritation caused among other laborers,
overworked If not underpaid, by the
spectacle of neighbors living in afflu
ence and case without any necessity
to curtail their expenditure. Rich men
nre black swans In nnlgarla. I was
told by a foreign banker in Sofia who
had traded for many years in the
country that he doubted greatly
whether there were fifty men in nil
the rural districts who had net in
comes of $5,000 n year.— London Illus
trated News.
Faults on Both Sides.
He was a mild and meek' kind of
husband, but at length his patience
and good nature gave out, and he went
to his lawyer to get him to draw up n
deed of separation from his exasper
ating better hnlf.
"Ah, well," said the luwyer thought
fully, "perhaps there may be faults on
both sides."
"You're right!" shouted the angry
client. "She has a hump on her back
and a wart 011 her nose."— New York
Times.
Her Kick.
"I don't mind finding a gray hair or
two In ray own hair," sighed the
bachelor girl, who shows some few
signs of the sear and yellow h-uf, "but
when I pay $3 for n nice bunch of
lovely Urown curls and have to pick
them out of those, too, it Isn't fair.
Do you think It is?"— Chicago Inter

"Say," queried tho would be humor

A County Investment
The board ot supervisors at their
last meeting passed an order tor the
purchase of a typewriter that baa
according to the minutes performed
service in the district attorney's
office for the past ten years, paying
the sum of «100 therefor. At the pre
vious meeting, it seems, it waa re
solved to purchase au up-to-date type
writer for uae "in the district attor
ney's office, tbe same of course to be
the property of the county. Ihia
action, however, was rescinded at the
March meeting, uud the program
changed so tnat the county gets tbe
tou year old typewriter for tho pnoo
of a new one. Tbe reason given for
tbis action is, according to tbe ro-
Bolutiou itself, tbat the typewriter
has beeu used on county business by
the oflicials fur tho past tou years.
ibe iufoieucH is, tbat because it has
boau practically worn out in the
public service tburofor the county
should pay tor it at its first cost on i
tho strength nf its past usutuiuess,
and without regard to its present or
future ollicieucy. Tiuly, tbat will j
strike tbe averugo reader as wonderful
logic. A socoud - hand typewriter
can be bought; for from 820 to 825,
thoroughly overhauled and repaired;!
why tbo couuty should pay 8100 for
such a machine is beyoud compre
hension. Tbe fact tbut it has been
wholly or partially worn out by a
county official is anything but a
valid argument. Tbe cHleiuls are
paid a salary widen is in full com
pensation for all services rendered.
Ibe reasoning process is just about
ou a pur with tbe notion tbat because
tbe material in a printing office bas
been made second-hand by county
work, therefore, the couuty treasury
ought to be called upon to furnish a
uew outfit.

sets forth that plaintiff is the owner
ot the Last Chance quartz mine; that
the property has beeu advertised by
the defendant, in connection with
the Kclinso and Kclipt-e Extension,
to be sold, for delinquent taxes' of
1890, down to 1903 a total ot 52074.21;
it is alleged that tbe assessment lor
seven years from 18'J(i to 1902, is
erroneous and iiisutiicieut ; that tho
Lust Chance miuo is illegally assess
ed, beiug an unpatented mining
claim, aud thu titlo is vested iv the

Jacoby for $1L),OOU, waa at tbe tim»
aud has ever since been a void instru

I property; tbat the estimate of taxes

in tbe notico ot sale includes pro
perty not authorized to bo sold: viz.
lot 19 block '2, of Amador (Jity; that
it includes a tax ou property exempt

state, namely for the years l!>04 and
1005; tbat tbe assessment roll for IB9S
does not show that any amount of tba

troller, inasmuch as tbe tax collector
says be will sell the property in orts
parcel, and the controller authorizes
him to sell in separate lots or parcels.
Plaintiff prays that tbe court deter
mine tbe amount of taxes justly due
against said property, and that tba
amount thereof be paid into the trea
sury of Amador oouuty iv full pay

ROOSEVELT'S HUNTING TRIP.
Theodore Konaevelt, fifty years of
age, having, on March 4, with hla re
tirement aa twenty-sixth president of
tbe United States, completed over
twonty-flvo yeHra of public service,
has decided to take a rest and recrea
tion In a two-years' trip abroad, half
of which will be spent In Afrlon
under the British ling as a faunal
naturalist and tbe other half In
Europo visiting at least three of tbe
big capitals. At tbe bead of a sainn
tlflo expedition outfitted by the
Smithsonian Institution ot Washing
ton bo will, witb his son, Kermit,
and tliruo other Amerlcnu naturalists
of note — Major I'Jdgnr A. Mearns, .1.

makn a collection of maininiils, hit dp,
reptiles, Insoots and botanical speci
mens of Central Africa, which will be
doposited in the United Statos
National Museum at Washington.
Tho party loaves Now York City
about tbe middle oC t Maich, going by
tlni Mediterranean route to Gibraltar
and Naples. At Naples the members
of tho expedition will board a steamer
of the (Jertnnn East Africa lino for
Kiliudini harbor, Mombasa island.
They will arrive at the tiast African
port toward tbe ond of April, proceed
by the Ugnnda railway to Nairobi,
spend six motitba tliove. tben cou
tiuue by rail to Port l'loreuca, Lake
Victoria Nyariza, making a total dis
tance of bB4 mile 3by rail. Thu ex
pedition will ,oross Uganda by
caravan, and finally pass down tbe
whole length of tbe Nile, reaching
Khartoum about April 1910. Much of
the hunting and specimen collecting
will be done In Uritiab I-Just Africa,
where tbe Uganda railway will be
used as a menus of ready transpor
tation from Nairobi, which will be
tbe base of supplies. At Khartoum,
it is expected, the president and bis
son will be joined by Mrs Uoosevelt,
who will Hucoiupauy thorn on their

tbe party will proceed direct to tbe
United States from Egypt. Mr Roose

The Tanner's Wife
I* very careful about her churn. 8h«
scalds it thoroughly after using, and give*
it a sun bath to sweeten it. Sho knows
that if her churn is sour It will taint the
butter that is made in it. Tho stomach is
a churn. In the stomach and digestive
and nutritive tracts are performed pro
cesses which are almost exactly like the
churning of butter. Is it not apparent
then that if this stomach-churn is foul it
makes foul all which is put Into it?
Tho ovli of a foul stomach is not alone
tho bad taste In tho mouth and the foul
breath caused by It, but tho corruption of
tho pure current of blood and tho dissem
ination of disease throughout the body.
Dr. Plerce's Golden Medical Discovery
makes the sour and foul stomach sweet.
It does for the stomach what the washing
and sun bath do for thochurn— absolutely
removes every tainting or corrupting ele
ment. In this way It cures blotches,
pimples, eruptions, scrofulous swellings,
sores, or open eating ulcers and all
humors or diseases arising from bad blood.
If you have bitter, nasty, foul taste In
your mouth, coated tongue, foul breath,
are weak and easily tired, fool depressed
and despondent, have frequent headaches,
dizzy attacks, gnawing or distress in stom
ach, constipated or irregular bowels, sour
or bittsr risings after eating and poor
appetite, theso symptoms, or any consider
able numbf-r of th«m, indicate that you are

OUR MYSTERIES.
We know not what it is, dear,
This sleep to deep and still;
Ibe folded bands, the awful oalm—
Ibe obeek so pale and chill;
The llda tbat will not Jitt again.
Though we may .mil and call;
The strange white solitude of peaoe
Tbat settles over all.
We know not whnt, it means, dear,
This deaolato hontt-pnin;
This dread tv take our daily way,
And walk in It u«nlu;
We know not to wlmt other sphere,
The loved who lenve us go,
Nor why we'ro loft to woudor still,
Nor why wo do not know.
Hut this wo kumv;our loved nud dead,
If (hey should come this diiy—
Should uotno aurl ask us— "What of
lilo?"
Not mm of us could say.
JLifo la a mystery ns deep
. Ah I'vnr death can lus
Yet, oh, bow dear it In to knnw—
This life wo livo mill sou.
Then might they say— thoso vanquish

And tilossed ia tho thought:—
Ho death is swoet to us, neloved,
Though we may show you naught;
Wo may not to the quick reveal
"i'he mystory ot death —
Vo oiinuut tell us, if y*i would 1 ,
The mystory ol breath.
The child who enters life comes not'
With knowledge or intent,
To those who en'ers death must go
As little children sent.
Nothing is known. Hut I believe .
That Hod is over limn!;
And aa life ia to the living,
So death is to tbe doad.

In the new nebular hypothesis of
Prof. T. J. •). See, it is assumed that
a spiial nebula was formed by two or
more streams ot cosmic dust, which
met In sucb n way as to produce
n whirling motion about it central
vortex. I'his' nebula wits much larger
than the present solar system, and us
it ooiled up under its own gravitation,
the spirals wore gradually drawn
nearer togetner.and the nuclei formed
in tbe coils gathered more cosmic
dust, beginning tbe planets, which at
first moved in elliptic paths of great
eccentricity. Tbe resistance of tbe
nebula reduced tbe orbits in size,
giving their present remarkable
roundness. Tbe limits of tbe Holar
System may be still unknown, for tbe
orbit of Neptune Is almost circular,
and this indicates that, even at this
great distance from the center, tbe
nebula offered much resistance ot
moving bodies, and must have bad
sufficient density to form several large
planets beyond those now known.
Tbe new process announced by
Consul Ollvares, of Managua, is de
signed to make soft wood proof
against the ravages ot the termites, oi
white ante. — which in the tropics
often destroy tbe finest buildings in
six months, — and is specially recom
mended to makers of furniture and
woodenware intended for use in tropi
cal countries. Of untreated woods
only eucalyptus and teak resist tbe
termites. Tbe treatment consists in
boiling the newly out timber in a
saooharioe solution which extracts
tbe air and coagulates tbe albumen
in tbe sap. and then rapidly drying
at fairly high temperature. Tbe hard,
homogeneous product— which does
not shrink, warp or split— resists tbe
dry rot of temperate lands as well aa
the tropio termites.
Titanium is said to be the only
metal suitable for tbe bearings and
hxloh nf certain modern gasoline
motors, whiob run at speeds as high
as 3,000 revolutions per minute. Tbe
metal is obtained from rutile, or
titanium dioxide, a miueral of little
commercial importance hitherto.
The fogpbone of K. 11. Marriott, of
Brooklyn, ia designed to prevent
oollisious at sea by a combination of
wireless telephony and tbe ordinary
fog bell or tbe submarine bell, and
its action depends upon tbe fact that
the souutt of tbo bell travels in air
about 1,000 feet per second, or elight
ly faster in water, while the trans
mission of tbe same sound by tbe
wireless telephone ia practically in
stantaneous, or at the rate of light—
about 180,(100 miles n second. As the
man in the pilot-bouse catches tbe
sound of the. bell in the telephone
recoiver, be presses the button that
starts tin instrument resembling n
stop watch. When tho sound of the
bell arrives by uir or water, waves he
slops I. lie instrument ami the dial —
instead of indicating seconds likG tbo
watch— shows tbe miles and feet the
sound bns traveled. At tbe distance
of two mi led tbe air sound would bo
heurd about ten seconds after that of
tbe telephone. When tbe tiell is next
heard, the indicator shows whether
the distance has iucroased or diiuiu
iihed, nud thus tho navlgutor is noti
lii'd if there ia danger ot collision.
It was decreed by tbo convention
of 1818 aud tbe treaty of Washington
of 1816 that Ibe boundary batween tbe
United States und Cauuda from the
Lake of the Woods to the PaoitJo
a distance of 1270 milos-Bbould
follow the forty-uiuth parallel. 'Iho
surveyors who have lately completed
the locatiou of the boundary have
found that the astronomical parallel
varies horn a direot circle around the
earth, and Prof. Otto Klotz explains
tbe curious fact that tbe linn, instead
of using straight, is at one point 800
feet south of tho direct oirole aud at
another place 000 feet north. It whs
decided that the astromonical parallel
—or Hue through places where tbe
Pole is 41 deg. from tbe zeuitb —
should be tbe accepted boundary.
This decision was followed, but looal
attraction in some places deflects tbo
plumb line and tbetefore tbe zenith
and tbe Hntioniouic«l torty-ulutb
parallel proves to be a quite irregular
line.

Tbe daylight brightness of an ordi
nary room, into which the sun is not
direotly shining, is found by J. K.
Woodwell to be commonly not more
than 1-10 oandle-power and sometimes
as low as 1-100 candle-power per
square inch. Most artificial lights
have a much greater intrinsic bright
ness, and this accounts for tbelr in
jurious effects when tbe eyes are not
shielded from their full glare. He
concludes that a diffused light of 1-5
to 1-10 candle power per square mob
is best. Strain and injury to tbe eye
have been attributed to ultra-violet
Jigbt, but such light is less in various
incandescent illnniinauts than in
direct or even reflected sunlight.

High Handed Diplomatic Methods of
the Seventeenth Century.
Indignities to which foreign envoys
were formerly subjected in China were
mild in comparison with those occa
sionally meted out to them In Constan
tinople. M. Julian Klnczks in his
"Etude de Diplomatic Ooutemporaine"
relates that In 1073 the grand vizier,
having intercepted some French dis
patches, tried to force Del la Haye.
first secretary to tbe French embassy
and son of the ambassador, to give
him tbe cipher of the embassy. The
young diplomat indignantly refused
and was in consequence bastinadoed,
struck In the face with such force that
bis teeth were broken, and he was
thrown into prison. No attempt .was
made by Louis XIV. to obtain redress
for the wrongs Inflicted on his repre
sentative.
Until the beginning of the eighteenth
century Christian envoys te the porte
were forbidden to visit one another or
even to confer with one another on
neutral ground. They were not al
lowed to drive in public with their
wives, and at one time It was pro
posed to prevent them from importing
wine for their own consumption. A
compromise was effected on this point.
on the understanding that tbe accurs
ed liquor was to be conveyed from the
harbor to the embassies, at night and

tions In the gift of the king of Sweden.
Originally it was instituted by Magnus
IV., some COO years ago, to commemo
rate the siege of T'psala, the ancient
capital of the Swedish kings, and Its
statutes bound the recipients of the
order to fight to the death for the main
tenance of their religion and to consti
tute themselves the special protectors
of the widow and the fatherless.
When it was revived about the middle
of the eighteenth century by King
Frederick the obligations laid upon the
members were somewhat less onerous.

Verse 39-Should a Christian al
ways be ready to go to tbe home nf
sorrow, to render help and impart

CITY OFFICIAL PAPER.
FRIDAY .' MARCH 12, 1909
LOCAL EDITORIAL COLUMN.
DIRECT PRIMARY.
The direct primary bill has been amended in the senate so
that the party vote expressive of preference for Uuited States
senator, shall be taken by districts, aud not by the popular
vote throughout the state, and that the result be of an ad
visory character upon the legislators of the respective dis
tricts. We are inclined to think this plan is preferable to
taking the vote •of the entire state as a whole upon the
question. The latter method would give an overwhelming
advantage to the large cities, where the voting population is
concentrated. By the arts well known to the professional
politician, a strong vote might be brought out in these cen
ters in favor of a particular aspirant, while the 1 vote in the
sparsely settled interior districts would be necessarily light.
We cannot see that the senate's amendment is in derogation
' of the direct nomination principle. There is no doubt the
choice of all state, county and municipal officers will here
after be by direct vote of the people. It will be a far more
expensive plan than the one it supplants, both to the counties,
who will have to foot the bills for the primary election as
they now do for the general election, and also to the candi-*
dates, who will practically have to make two canvasses, one
to secure a party nomination, and thereafter a general can
vass to secure election.
We do not believe the system will prove a panacea for all
our political ill; but it is worth trying, and will perhaps
break down the power of the bosses.
The committee of congress working on the revision of the
tariff, propose sweeping reductions on lumber, hides, wood
pulp, leather manufactured goods, etc. The proposed re
vision on the down grade is having a depressing effect upon
the commercial and industrial interests generally. The
special session promises to be a long and lively one. But
the republicans are determined to retain the protective fea
ture of the tariff, and that idea will be uppeimost in every
change proposed. With that policy adhered to little harm
can result to the home industries.
