FATAL DISCOVERIES.
INVENTIONS THAT BROUGHT THEIR
ORIGINATORS TO THE GRAVE.
Scientific Secrets That Hare Been
Buried With the Men Who Pos
■ettsed Them and That Wer» the
Causes of Their Tragic Taking O».
The maxim which states that silence
is golden has cost the world some of
the greatest discoveries of modern
times, for not a few of the inventors
whose names would have been handed
down to posterity us public benefac
tors have been killed by their secrets
before. they would consent to divulge
them to their fellow beings.
In 1595 all Europe was startled by
the discovery of a new explosive called
fulminite, which, it was believed,
would revolutionize modern warfare.
It was the Invention of an Exeter
scientist named Sawbridge, and sam
ples of thfi explosive which were test
ed 1 by the government revealed the fact
that its power was three times greater,
than that of cordite and In conse
quence it would treble the range of a
rifle bullet The German government
offered Sawbridge £20,000 for his in
vention, which he patriotically refused
until the home authorities had had the
first' option of purchase. But just as
the latter were about to seal a con
tract with him the news came that his
laboratory had been blown up and him
self with it Unfortunately he left
no records whatever, and although
some of the leading experts of the day
minutely examined the debris they
failed to discover the secret, which is
probably lost forever.
' About half a century ago an Italian
priest named Luigi Tarantl discovered
a method of making stained glass, the
coloring of which was declared equal
to that made by the ancients, whose
secret has been lost. Taranti aban
doned holy orders and set to work to
execute the hundreds of commissions
he received in the secrecy of his work
shop at Ostia, near Rome. The finest
stained glass windows In Italy were
made by him, and he guarded his se
cret well, for when a year la,ter he was
found dead of blood poisoning, set up
by the pigments he employed, it was
realized that he had carried his secret
with him. The cleverest workmen
were called In to examine the ingredi
ents, but they on§ and all failed to
penetrate the dead man's secret i
The person 'who could, make compo
sition billiard balls equal to those of
Ivory would quickly qualify as a mil
lionaire, and It Is not an impossible
task, . for It has already been done.
Some years ago a Scotch manufactur
er put composition billiard balls on the
market which were as good at but
only a third of the price of those al
ready In use. He refrained from pat
enting his Invention and. made all the
balls himself, even his family being
prohibited from sharing his secret
But just as he was beginning to taste
the fruits of his experiments he- was
one day mortally wounded by an acci
dent In his workshop and died before
he could make any statement Ex
perts were given specimens of the balls
to analyze, but In spite of the fact that'
they succeeded In tracing the materi
als use,d they have long since given up
all hopes of being able to discover how
they were put together.
The only man who has yet been suc
cessful In taking photographs in color
was a martyr to his discovery, the
secret of which is lost. Some years
ago Dr.. Herbert Franklin of Chicago
submitted a number of colored photo
graphs — of a somewhat crude nature,
It is . true— to the leading American
scientific' institutions, and the encour
agement he received was such that
he built himself a laboratory, proof
against the wiles of spies, at a cost
of f 12,000, wherein to perfect his in
vention. In the preparation of his
plates he used a charcoal fire, and one
day when at work he omitted to open
fhe ventilators and was found asphyx
iated. He had refrained from divulg
ing his secret to any one, and in con-
Bequence, although some partially fin
ished plates that hid the secret re
mained, the way they were prepared
Is a problem that has baffled scientists
to this day.
Another victim to his secret was
Adams, the inventor of tallium, the
greatest discovery in the metals of the
age. Adams was confident that a metal
pould be produced which, although as
bard as steel, was only half its weight
and price, and after five years' experi
menting with an electrical process tal
lium was the result- The Invention
was taken up throughout America, and
orders for thousands of tons of the
metal began to pour in from the lead
ing railway companies.
But It was too late. The enormous
mental strain he had undergone,
coupled with the sensation of finding
millions within his grasp, took away
his reason, and ho was confined in an
asylum. He left no records to explain
the process, and no amount of per
suasion drew the secret from bin),
Which perished locked up in his brain
when two years later he died a help

A NEWSPAPER SCOOP
HOW IT WAS OBTAINED WITHOUT

Sources of Information 4 Tof " Wate*'

spondent Is' Always Ready to Tokt
I/egttlinate Advantage.'
"Every once In awhile one reads iv
the newspapers of the determination
»f some one of the high j government
officials to discover the source of 'the
leak' of a piece of news which it vu
not desired should be given out at that
particular time," remarked. ''an old
Washington correspondent, "and with
out giving the solution to the secret
escapes of public information, •as they
vary, I 'will tell you of one instance
whiali > -mr ves to slow how news., ap-;
pears Jin print in what is considered by
all coScerned to he a very mysterious
manner. ' Like all mysteries, "when un
raveled it is wondered that It was not
thought of before. . My stof y Is en
tirely a part of the secret sources Of
information which all correspondents
have more or less at their disposal
and which often comes from the out
side and not from the inside of th«
departments.
"Some . time ago— the precise time is
"not essential to the story— a very im
portant public matter was up for de
termination by the president All of
the larger metropolitan dailies were
particularly Interested, : as It "did not
have to do especially with Washing
ton, and the entire correspondents'
world at the capital. was on the'qul
vive to 'get it,' including myself. All
channels which were usually tapped
by the initiated were found to be as
barren "as a desert stream In midsum
mer. Telegrams from the home offices
poured into our various ' bureaus here
couched .in Imperative language that
the news 'must' be obtained, evidently,
in the belief that all correspondents
have to do is to go out, ask. officials
for the desired . information ' and re
ceive i,t, coupled with a good cigar and
a bottle of wine. As a matter of fact,
when officials; wish to, keep secret a
piece of information, all possible loop
holes of escape are securely padlocked,
and.it Is the exception that' it gets out.
"I had about given up hope of secur
ing a 'beat' in this particular Instance,
though I was, of course, as vigilant as
ever. The time for the maturing of the
project was close at hand, and any day
it might by official announcement be
come public property, j One night as I
was sitting idly In the lobby of an up
town hotel, half dozing in my chair,
waiting for the appearance of a senator
with whom I had an appointment on an
Inconsequential matter, I overheard one
of two gentlemen who were sitting be
hind me drop the words the president,'
The high backs of "our . chairs nearly
touched, and by instinct my # drowsy,
senses became clear and I woke up."
" 'The president,' remarked one of the
gentlemen, 'said that it was his inten
tion to adopt that course irrespective
of the consequences either to himself or
the party.'
" 'Bat you pointed put to him what it
meant to vs — that he was clearly In er
ror?' replied the other gentleman.
" 'Elaborately,' responded the first
speaker, 'but the president said that he
was convinced that accruing results
would prove that we, and not he, were
In error.'  t ...
■ 'VThen we may as well go back to
New York tomorrow,' was the answer,
and both gentlemen arose and walked
toward the_ cafe, apparently In a very
despondent' frame of mind.
"I was an Involuntary listener to this
scrap of conversation, in which, it will
be observed, not a single word was
dropped as to the subject matter there
of. I at once jumped to the conclusion
that the government, through the presi
dent's actiou, intended to take -the af
firmative oi the proposition, the news
side of which the "correspondents had
So lopg iind earnestly endeavored to
ascertain. With a straight tip as to the
course of j the, government the corre
spondent could do the rest, while with
the wrong tip he could not only make
his paper ridiculous, but would in all
probability lose his position; hence the
care in making a scare head, page wide
story. .
"In U»e furtherance of my conclusion,
my paper had the 'beat' of the season
the following morning, as I stated the
facts as though they came from official
sources, as, Indeed; such I considered
them. To my mind, as n correspondent,
it was as clear as if the president him
self had given me the information. Two
days after a . member of the cabinet
gave out officially what I had wired
over and with it the announcement that
the 'leak' had occasioned much 'annoy
ance, and its source would bo Investi
gated thoroughly.' It Is here given cor
rectly for the first time."— Washington

What the Hair Tells.
Women who are the possessors of
fine black hair are. emotional and of
very sensitive nerves. Coarse black
hair is said to denote great energy,
but an unenviable disposition. Wom
en who have brown hair make the
best wives, for they are almost invari
ably full of sentiment, impassioned,
"high strung," loyal and easily af
fected. Bed haired people are nearly
.always keen in business transactions,
quick of perception, high tempered and
witty. The woman who has blond
hair is impulsive and loving, but usu
ally fickle, although an agreeable com
panion.— Pittsburg Press.

Death and the Philosopher.
A certain philosopher .was in' th«
6a bit of saying whenever he heard thai I
tn old friend had passed away: "Ah,
well, death comes to us all. It is no new -
thing. . It is - what we must expect l
Pass me the butter, my dear. Yes, I
death comes to all, and my friend's
time, had come." . . v . •.
, Now, Death overheard these philo
sophical remarks at different times,
and one day he showed himself to the •
philosopher. '
"I am Death," said he simply.
"Go away,", said the man, in a panic.
"I am not ready for you."
"Yes, but it Is one of your favorite
truisms that Death comes to all, and I;
am but proving your words." t
"Go away I You are dreadful!",
, "No. more dreadful than I always
am. But why have you changed so? \
You have never feared the death that
has | come ;to your friends, j I never j
heard you sigh when I carried off your
old companions. You have always said,
•It is the.way of all flesh: 1 Shall I
make an exception In favor of your
flesh?" . :
"Yes, for I am not ready."
'.. "But I am. Yonr time has come. Do
not repine. Your friends will go on
buttering then- toast They will take
it as philosophically as you have taken,
every other death." " .v; .
j And the philosopher and Death de
parted on a Jong'journey together.—

An English Sanctuary.
Beverley minster," 180 miles north of
London, is the shrine of St John of
Beverley, who died in the year 721.
In 038 Athelstan, king of England,
gave several privileges to the "monas
tery, one being the privilege of sanc
tuary. This was not merely for man
slayiug; It was open^to all wrongdoers
except those who bad been guilty of
treason. For ordinary offenses, such
as horse stealing) cattle stealing, being
backward in accounts or being in re
ceipt of suspected goods, a man cam*
Into sanctuary about a mile from the
monastery or church. There used to be
four crosses on the main roads leading
to Beverley marking, the limit of the
area. In cases of manslaughter and.
murder it was not sufficient to be with
in one of these crosses. Before the
fugitive could claim sanctuary he must
enter the church and seat himself in a
stone chair known as the "frid stool"
or "freed cbairV' To this place many
fled for. refuge from all parts of the
country.

"Yes, he's suffering ' from ' rheuma
tism," said the woman.
| "Yes" and I can cure him, lady, If
you will let me have six fancy plates,
but you must be sure they are nice." ;
"Oh, anything to get him well," said
the woman. "I'm willing- to do any
thing," and she fetched a half dozen
fine, china plates that had been her
pride. '. ' I •' ,: ; -.: ; ,
- The gypsy set them out in a row, one
after the other,' placed her hands on
the , four center ones, mumbled some
words over them and said: 
\ "Now, If you will let me take these
plates a way. with me to destroy them
your boy will, be cured of rheumatism.
No more aches and pains for him, lady;
nothing but good health,' lady, j Let me
take them, lady, and cure him.'.' .
: And the curious part of it is the wo
man did give the gypsy those plates.
, ■ Tlic Love of Mother*.
■ Among the lower, animals the moth
er's love" for her offspring lasts -only
until the . offspring ■Is able tp shift
for Itself. The hen will fret and
fight for her downy chicks, but when
they become feathered and commence
to do their own foraging the mother
hen becomes Indifferent to them and
thinks only of hatching another brood.
The mare loves her foal and the cow
her calf only during the suckling pe
riod. Canine dams cease to show af
fection to their progeny after the pyp
py age, says the San Franciaco Bulle
tin. So through "the entire animal
kingdom below the human species the
maternal instinct endnres only while
the young ones are helpless and ceases
when they have grown up.
•How different is the love of a human
mother for her children! That love
never dies and seems to grow more In
tense according as the children become
less and less worthy of It. The black
sheep Is often the best beloved.
A Voracious Spider.
It is a curious study to watch the
little white, brown specked spiders
which hover . among . plants seeking
what they may devour. It seems al
most incredible that they will conquer
and carry off to their dens insects
twice their size, but this is just what
they do, capturing flies of the largest
kind. They will. hide under the petals
of the flowers, and when Mr. Fly comes
buzzing along they will spring out at
him, and the next thing he knows be is
being dragged off to. be sepved up at a
spider luncheon. They grip the fly by
the neck, if he has n neck, and dart
down the leaves, skip to the grass and
away, sometimes taking flying leaps of
a foot and a half, then disappearing no
one knows where. - It's the old story of
the spider aud the fly, only the spider
doesn't stop to cods, but boldly carries
off his booty without saying, "By your
leaye,"
Priina Donna and Her Voice,
Once upon a time there was a fa
mous jirlma donna who made a con
tract with a noted impresario to sing
in concerts for him at a price which
made each of her notes of about, the
value of $1.
All went well until the prima donna
found a dressing room assigned to her
that did not meet with her approval.
Then she complained that she was en
tirely too hoarse to Bing, and the im
presario had to make polite remarks to
his audience and dismiss it after re
funding the money paid for admission.
The remarks that he made out of the
hearing of the audience were not so
polite. .

For Governor.
-GEORGE C. PARDEE, of Oakland
Congress, J. N. GILETTE, Humboldt
to Voters.
. Voters are cautioned to use the
utmost care in stamping their bal
lots. There will be several, places
on the ticket marked "no nomina
tion," indicating that the political
party whose heading appears at the
top of that column has made no
nomination for the officedesignated.
Such a case occurs in the republican
column for county recorder, and
also in both republican and demo
cratic columns for subordinate town
ship officers. ' It is necessary to
leave the blank squares to the right
of these places thus marked "no
nomination," untouched. A cross
in any of .«ucli squares will be apt to
cause trouble. Don't monkey with
these "no nomination" spaces in any
way. Let every republican voter
who does not fully understand how
to mark his ballot, take his sample
ballot to some trusted person and
get him to mark it just the way he
wants to vote. He can then take
the sample ballot into the booth with
him, and mark his regular ballot in
exact conformity thereto. Let
every voter also remember that if he
accidently stamps bis ballot wrong
ly — that is if be puts a cross opposite
a name or proposition he does not
wish to vote for — he can return the
ballot to the clerk as a spoiled bal
lot, and get another in place there
of. The greatest danger consists in
putting a cross _in a square which
does not represent a candidate to
be voted for. With this point safe
guarded, there need be little risk of
marking the ballot so as to give
room for quibbling.
Another point we wish to impress
upon republicans, namely! that a
citizen who in"his affidavit of regis
tration has stated that he is able to
mark his own ballot, must not call
for assistance. In an election con
test in Amador county, within recent
years, votes have been deducted
fronTa candidate because it was
shown that the voter had received
assistance, when his affidavit showed
that he could make out his own bal
lot. This ruling may seem extreme
ly arbitrary arid unjust when ap
plied to all cases. For instances
there are scores of persons in Ama
dor county who cannot see without
spectacles. It would be risky for
such to attempt to mark a ballot
without glasses. With glasses, how
ever, they can stamp a ballot easily.
Some voters have a considerable
distance to go to the polling place?
Now in case a citizen of this class
accidentally leaves his glasses at
home, and for that reason calls for
aid in making his ballot, is it just
and right that his vote should be
thrown out on a contest. Or if a
person able to make out his ballot at
the time of making the affidavit of
registration, becomes disabled sub
sequently, and before election day,
and consequently is compelled to
call for help, is there any reason
why his vote should be rejected.
However, it is well to impress upon
citizens the necessity of taking their
artificial eyes with them to the poll
ing place, if their natural sight is
not sufficient to enable them to mark
their ballots. Try to steer clear of
all these little legal snags, and vote
the republican'ticket as straight as
your conscientious scruples will
permit.
J. C. Camp*bell, the well known re
publican orator, in a speech de
livered recently, had the following
to say in reference to the democratic
nominee for governor. It is in keep
.ing with the silence he maintains
about the democratic platform: He
will taik about anything and every
thing rather than the policy mapped
out in the platform. Here is his
picture politically:
"What are Mr. Lane's politics?
Has he any? At the time we found
him, when an editor of a paper in
the state of Washington, he was
vigorously attacking the tariff laws
of our land and particularly the Mc-
Kinley bill. Again, in 1899, at the
opening of the campaign, he is quot
ed as saying that he was no partisan
and that it was the duty of all good
citizens to uphold the Philippine
policy of President McKinley. In
1902 we find him nominated upon
and indorsing (for a very short time)
a democratic platform, again de
nouncing the American tariff and
arraigning the republican party
upon the Philippine policy. Then
again we find him abandoning plat
form, abandoning party, abandon
ing those who are nominated on the
ticket with him, and announcing
himself as a Roosevelt democrat.
What a Roosevelt democrat is God
in his infinite wisdom alone can tell.
I assure you Ido not know. Hencei
I repeat, what is Mr. Lane's politics."
In some quarters an effort is being |
made to prejudice the candidacy of
S. G. Spagnoli, because, as one of
the bondsmen of J. P. Thomas, trea
surer of the Knights of Pythias lodge
of Jackson, he declined to make good
a deficiency of $1500, which Thomas
at the time of his death owed to
said lodge. The idea is intended to
be conveyed that Spagnoli was un
willing to meet a financial obligation
solemnly entered into as a surety for
Thomas, and that suit had to be
brought to compel him to pay. This
is an unmerited reflection upon Mr
Spagnoli, and we hasten to place the
matter in its true light. S. G; Spag
noli and- A. Perovich were on the
bond of Thomas. At the time the
lodge required the bondsmen to
make good the $1500, and brought
suit against the bondsmen alone for
its recovery, without including the
estate of Thomas in the suit, there
was*a sum^of money amounting to
$5013 73 lying in the county treasury
to the credit of the Thomas estate.
Knowing this, the bondsmen natur
ally took the ground, that the estate
being primarily liable, should have
been sued first, or at least coupled
with the bondsmen in the suit which
was commenced agaiust them. Un
der these circumstances they deter
mined to stand trial? with the view
not of evading the obligation, but
to get them to look to the estate as
well for the collection of the short
age. Judgment, however, was re
covered against the bondsmen alone
for the full amount and interest, and
thereupon the judgment was prompt
ly satisfied by the two bondsmen.
Thereafter the. bondsmen, Spagnoli
and Perovich, commenced suit
against G. A. Gritton, administrator
of the estate of J. P. Thornas,~and
in July, 1901, obtained a judgment
for $1760, which was the sum they
had already paid to the lodge as
bondsmen, wijh interest and costs
added. This judgment was at once
paid out of the funds of the Thomas
estate. This roundabout way of col
lection cost the bondsmen $400 for
attorney fees and other expenses.
The outcome is a complete vindica
of the ■ position assumed by the
bondsmen, that the Thomas estate,
with ample funds to pay, should have
been sued in the first place. Mr:
Spagnoli acted as any reasonable
man would have acted under the
circumstances. He did not want to
shirk payment. If the estate had
been without funds, the bondsmen
would have paid without a murmur,
and without suit. No man can
blame Spagnoli, and no voter can
withhold support from him as treas
urer on account of this affair.
- A story has been circulated to the
effect that Mr. Detert and others
have furnished the funds with which
T. K. Norman' has made and is now
making the canvass for sheriff. This
canard was started early in the cam
paign, and is being revamped in the
closing days, as a last desperate ef
fort to stem the current which has
been setting in toward Norman from
the start. We have been authorized
by Mr. Norman to deny the report
in toto. No man, and no body of
men, has put up one cent toward his
campaign expenses. He has made
the fight on his own financial re
sources entirely. Even if the story
were true, we cannot see that it
would amount to a very serious
offense either in the eyes of the law
or of strict morality. But as a mat
ter of fact there is not a scintilla of
truth in it. Mr. Norman will pay
five hundred dollars to any one who
can prove that one dollar of his ex
penses in making- the canvass for
sheriff and tax collector has been
contributed by any one other than
himself.
.The candidacy of F. M. Angelotti,
on the republican ticket for associate
justice of the supreme court, appeals
strongly to the voters of Amador
county. He has held the position of
superior judge in Marin county for
many years, and so acceptably has
he discharged the duties of that of
fice, that he was selected as emi
nently qualified for the supreme
bench. His strongest recommenda
tions come from the neighborhood
where he lives, and it is safe to say
that he will run far ahead of his
ticket in Marin. Members of the bar
in the city are so well satisfied with
this nomination that they have
formed a special organization for the
purpose of aiding in his election.
The candidate is a native of Cali
fornia, of Italian parentage. As a
jurist he has few equals in the state.
That he will run away ahead of his
ticket is a foregone conclusion.
Amador county is expected to give
him a substantial majority. His
associate nominee, Lucien Shaw, of
Los Angeles, is also a strong candi
date, and in every way worthy of
the solid support of his party.
It is the running expenses of the
local government which have helped
to cause the taxes to mount up from
$1.50 in 1888 and other years, to the
present rate of $1.95. This cause
has come about in face of an in
creased assessment roll of half a
million.

TIIE AMATHTB LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FT?TDj\TV OCTOBER 31, 1902,
A SAMPLE APPEAL.
M . Uutler is an Englishman, the
son of a Cornish miner, and will speak
principally to the miners.
We find the above statement on a
poster issued by the democratic
county central committee, announc
ing meetings for Jackson and Sutter
Creek at which Samuel Butler Esq.,
was to be one of the speakers. Why
Mr. Butler's nativity and parentage
should be paraded in the poster can
only be surmised. Of course there
was a definite and special object in
view in so doing. He is said to be a
labor union man from Grass Valley,
and it was thought that by bringing
him to Amador county to address
the miners, many of whom are
Cornish, his words would have
greater weight because he claimed a
common birth place with them. This
is another straw tending to show
the desperate' straights to which the
local democracy is reduced. The
implication conveyed in that state
ment is an affront to every English
born citizen. Voters of this class
resent the idea that they can be led
like a flock of sheep by a glib talker
because he happens to claim a cer
tain spot of earth as his birth-place.
We beg to inform these blundering
politicians that considerations of
this nature enter not into the make
up of their political faith. Such
low-down appeals are more apt to
repel than to attract them. Citizens
of English birth will yield to none in
love of native land, but in matters
pertaining to the exercise of politi
cal rights iv their adopted country
they will look with disfavor upon all
appeals that are not addressed to
them simply and solely as American
citizens. The individual thus select
ed for this kind of missionary work
realized the hopelessness of such
methods, if his employers did not,
and discreetly kept mum about his
or his hearer's nativity from begin
ning to end of His speech.
An Illegal Contract.
? District Attorney 'C. P. Vicini in
timated in Sutter Creek at the demo
cratic meeting, that he had never been
a party to the fleecing the county out
of $900 by recommending or sanctioning
an illegal contract, as be said had been
reported by one in the audience. Now
the facts of the transaction referred to
are about as follows: '"
In January, 1900, the board of super
visors of Amador county let a contract
to John A. Brown to map for the use
of the assessor the 600 sections of land
in the county at $3 per section amount
ing to $1800. This act of tho board
was illegal, but in spite of that the
present district attorney, C. P. Vicini,
who is now seeking re-election, advised
said board that this mapping belonged
to the assessor's office. The assessor
told the board he wanted the maps,
and did Dot care who made them. The
board then, upon the advice of the
district attorney, illegally let the con
tract for the map-making which-be
longed to the surveyor's office. The
law on the subject is as follows:
Section 139 of the county government
act of 1897 reads: The county sur
veyor shall plat, trace, blue-print, or
otherwise make all county, township,
road, district, and all other maps, and
all assessor's block books, for the
county of which he is surveyor.
Also subdivision 12 of section 189 of
the same act, in fixing the compensa
tion of county officials, says: The sur
veyor, such fees as are now or may be
hereafter allowed by law; provided he
shall be given all work for the county
in which the county employs one sur
veyor or civil engineer.
John A. Brown sublet said map mak
ing to Geo. I. Wright, who made the
same, and was pleased at that time to
get the job. At the time 4he board let
this illegal contract, they passed a
resolution that the maps should be
made under the general supervision of
Übe county surveyor. This was no
doubt for the purpose of pacifying the
surveyor for the diversion of the work
from his office. The maps were made
and accepted and paid for by said
board, but without the approval or
consent of the county surveyor. Mr.
Wright and his assistants who made
said maps, received for the same from
$900 to iIOOO. . The maps are not worth
one cent more than Mr. Wright re
ceived for them. John A. Brown in
dividually did not make a single plat
or map for which he had the contract.
Where did the balance of $800 or 8900
go to? Presumably towards paying
part of John A. Brown's shortage to
the county as assessor.

A LAME PLEA.
After long delay, and under the
pressure of public opinion, the Dis
patch and allied papers, came out
recently with an -article in defense
of Judge Rust in leaving the county
during the summer of 1900, and other
times, mention of which absence h'us
been made several times in the Led
ger. This defense, in short, is that
it is customary for the superior
court in all counties of the state to
take a vacation during the summer.
That the bar association of Araa
dor county, on the 30th day of June,
1900, presented a petition to the court
signed by all the members, request
ing the superior court to grant a
vacation of six weeks, from July 20
to September 10, ■ 1900. In compli
ance with said petition, a vacation
was accordingly ordered. Similar
action has been taken, on similar
petitions, both before and since 1900.
This in brief is the plea in justifica
tion of the action of the judge of the
superior court in absenting himself
from the county during the critical
period of nearly two months in the
summer of 1900. It simply amounts
to a plea of guilty as charged. Does
our cotemporary contend, will any
lawyer in town contend, that the
presentation of a petition by the
members of the local bar for a sum
mer vacation, will justify a superior
judge — who is an officer in the era
ploy of the state, and whose duties
are clearly defined by law — io ab
senting himself from his office for
six weeks at one time. The attor
neys comprising the bar were peti
tioning for themselves— not for the
salaried officers of the court. They
merely asked that no cases should be
tried, or set for trial, during the
period covered by the vacation.
That their appeal for a- vacation
should be twisted into a release of
the judge also from his duties is the
wildest kind of logic. It would be
just as reasonable to say that the
entire court — comprising judge, dis
trict attorney, sheriff and clerk— are
liberated from their sworn duties by
the same simple. process. The prop
osition is too absurd for discussion.
It is uot true that superior judges iv
other counties are accustomed to
absent themselves as was done here
in 1900 and at other times. In cities
having more than one super
ior, judge, and where the judges
are pressed with business all; the
time — which is not the case here — a
rest may be absolutely needed, but
never is the city left without a su
perior judge ready to transact busi
ness. In a county like Amador, it
is absolutely necessary for good gov
ernment that the judge of the su
perior court be here, ready for the
transaction of business. Individual
and property rights are, liable to
crop up at any time, and demand
immediate attention. 'Let us see
what the law says on this question.
Article VI sec 5 of the Constitu
tion of California says:
The superior court sha'.l
be always open (legal holidays and non
judicial days excepted.)
To make it still more emphatic, if
that were possible, the same idea is
incorporated in the codes. Sec. 73
of the code of civil procedure reads:
The superior courts shall be always
open (legal holidays and non-judicial
days excepted) and they shall hold their
sessions at the county seats of the sev
eral counties or cities and counties
respectively.
And yet in face of this obligation,
enthroned in the constitution and
reiterated in the codes, and accept
ed by every superior judge "before
entering upon the duties of his office
with all the solemnity of an oath, we
are told that the law was violated,
and has been violated for years, be
cause the bar of Amador county
asked for a vacation. This line of
argument, pressed to its ultimatum,
means that the superior judge an
office created by law, and the officer
sworn to obey and enforce the law —
is himself superior to the law; that
to suit his convenience or pleasure,
he can suspend or nullify the pro
visions of the constitution, or of the

A proposition so revolting to com
mon sense it is needless to discuss.
We will now state the facts. In
July, 1900, the smallpox was raging
in Jackson. The disease at that
time was regarded with ten-fold
more terror than now. People were
leaving by scores, and business was
paralyzed. Moreover a presidential
election was pending, and less than
a month remained in which persons
entitled to citizenship could get
naturalized in time to vote at that
election. The sacred right of suffrage
was dependent upon the judge stay
ing at his post of duty. The pres
ence of an appalling pestilence was
an additional reason why every pub
lic official should remain with his

people and allay the widespread,
apprehension. Rut Amador coun
ty's judge joined in the exodus, and
did not return until over a, week
after the so-called vacation had ex
pired. Men eu titled to naturaliza
tion were 1 laired of their rights
because of his ulwence, and lost their
votes.in a presidential year as a con
sequence,thereof. If other county
officers had followed this example—
aud they had just as much legal
right to do so as the judge had—
Amador would have been left with
out a government, and chaos would
have prevailed in a time of panic
and plague. Will the voters iudoi'se
this low estimate of the claims of
official duty. "A public duty is, the
most sacred trust that can .bo con
fided to man. Its claims are higher
than the demands of personal pleas

ties of home or kindred; aye, strong

A Significant Straw.
A small item has been brought to our
attention this week which is worthy of
ventilation in these columns, as serv
ing to show how taxpayers are called
upon to boar needless expense. The
matter, it is true, is a small one, and in
itsolf amoants to a mere trifle in the
affairs of government. . The principle,
however, is of vital importance. The
old saying; "Take care of the cents,
and the dollars will take care of them
selves, " is as true to-day as it was one
hundred years bacl? It is jusf as ap
plicable to "public affairs as to private
affairsi An officer is bound to exorcise
the same economy in the transaction of
pnblic business as he does in his own
private concerns. There can be no
question as to the correctness and the
necessity of a rigid adherence to this
rule. Wheuevor a. county officer,
whether for political or -personal
reasons it mattors not, departs from
this line, it is time the .taxpayers for
their own interests made a revision of
their employes. Now every voter dur
ing tho past week has received through
tho mail a sample ballot. The law re
quires tho county clerk to mail one to
every voter before the election. These
ballots, were" sent out in common
stamped envelopes; Issued by the
authorities at Washington. They were
specially ordered through the local
postmaster, and something like 3500
wore required. Of course it was a sav
ing of time to get them ready stamped,
as ta affix a one cent .stamp on that
number of envelopes would consume
considerable time. Besides which it
was cheaper. The ready stamped
envelopes could be purchased for less
than tho envelopes and stamps could
have been bought separately. So far
so good. But on the outside of these
envelopes was printed the official ad
dress of C. L. Culbert, as county clerk,
whichin itself was right and proper
This printing was , done in Amador
county, presumably at the Dispatch
office, and the envelops were ordered by
the proprietor of the Dispatch, who
was informed of the facts hereinafter
stated' by. the local postmaster, but we
do not know whether the information
was communicated to the county clerk
himself. It is in this little printing
job that tho sacrifice of the taxpayers'
interests comes in. This printing done
in a local office, according to established
rates, cost about $10 or $12. Now it is
well known, that where a quantity of
envelopes are specially ordered from
tho postal department; the printin" of
tho address on tho outside can be done
without extra chargo. Those envelopes,
therefore, might have boon secured all
ready printed as well as stamped, for
the same price as without the print
ing. Therefore the $10 or $12 in
curred for printing was so much money
thrown away. It was a plum thrown
to the printer at the expense of tax
payers. Would any sensible business
man act thus in the transaction of his
private affairs? From the taxpayers
standpoiut it amounted to a free gift of
that much money from" the public
treasury. Taxpayers have been called
upon to pay one-third more than they
ought to havo paid. For what? Is it
any wonder that the tax-rate is on the
ascending scale when county funds are
tossed about in this reckless fashion.
It is right and proper that printing
should bo done in tho county if pos
sible, • where no serious difference in
cost would be entailed. If we mistake
not, however, the sample ballots them
selves were printed outside tho county.
\\ hy? Certainly not because they
could not have been printed equally as
well in the county. The law requiring
all job printing to be done in the coun
ty if practicable, appears to havo been
wiped from the statute books in recent
years. Nevertheless the policy is a
wholesome one, and taxpayers will not
favor tho diversion of public business
to outside offices when the same might
have been dono at the same price with
in the county. The printing of the
ballots will cost at a rough estimate
over $100. Some months ago affidavits
of registration were gotten outside the
county at a cost of something like $80,
if we remember rightly. That work
might havo beon done for less money
at homo. Is it not time for a change
when such things are taking place in
our midst.

nence of the speaker, Congressman Mc-
Lachlan, that attracted them, but also
a determined, organized effort to make
this affair one of the most momorablein
point of numbers and enthusiasm. It
was intended as a show of strength. To
the efforts of the Sutter Creek and
Amador City Republican Club the suc
cess of the gathering was mainly due.
J. B. Tregloan took the matter in
hand, and strainod every nerve, and
to his energy and personal attention to
every detail, the gratifying result is
largely attributable. Tho Jackson
and Plymouth bands were in attend
ance/ also the Oneida glee club and
Plymouth glee club added to theonter
tainment with campaign songs. Tho
meeting was held in Taylor & Allen's
hall, which, thoqgb large, could not
hold one-third of the throng that
sought admittance. John R. Tregloan
called the meeting to order, and read a
long list of vice presidents, who were
requested to take seats on the platform.
This list was a show of strength in
itself, inasmuch as it embraced the,
principal mining, business, and • pro
fessional men of the county. Tho pres
ident of the meeting, S. K. Thornton,
superintendent of the Shenandoah
mine of Plymouth, was introduced,
and made a brief speech. The county
candidates were next introduced, each
one making a short address touching
his own candidacy. O. E. Martin, the
resident candidate for justice of the
peace, and T. S. Tuttle, nominee for
constable, also addressed the meeting.
C. H. McKenney, i candidate for the
assembly, gave an able speech, fully
demonstrating his ability to look after
the interests of the district in the lower
branch of the state legislature.
. W. C. Ralston, nominee for state
senator, spoke at some length, touch
ing his record in the last legislature.
He "was in hia happiest vein, and his
remarks were greeted with frequent
bursts of applause.
After another song by the glee club,
the speaker of the evening. Congress
man MeLaehlai}, of Pasadena, address
ed the gathering. His discussion of
national topics showed what the repub
lican party had done for the country;
how democracy had retarded its de
velopment whenever it had been* given
an opportunity to carry out its mis
chievous tenets. It was a masterly
exposition of the issues of the campaign
from the republican side, and listened
to with breathless interest fr6m begin
ning to end.
During the ..evening "the following
telegrams were read, and greeted with
rounds of applause:

At the close of the meeting threo
rousing cheers were ' given for the
whole republican ticket.
A ball was given by the band boys
after the speaking, also a supper at the
hotel which was liberally patronized.
Many of the visitors from outside towns
came straggling homeward long - aftor
sunrise.
A Gun Bursts.
West Point was the scene of a seri
ous accident last Saturday by the
bursting of a shotgun. Grovo Brupe
and a boy named Nixon were out hunt
ing with a muzzle loading shotgun.
The shotgun burst in Bruce's hand,
literally tearing his left hand to rib
bons. Some 40 shots were lodged in
young Nixon's thigh. Dr. Wells of
West Point was called, and realizing
the serious character of tho injuries,
telephoned for Dr. Roberts of Volcano.
Aftor consultation, they administered
an anaesthetic, and amputated the
middle finger back to the wrist joint.
Nixon's leg- was also attended to, and
at last accounts both patients were
doing well.
Bad" Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign.
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. For
weak digestion, for defective- nourish
ment, for consumption, take Scott's
Emulsion. It restores flesh because it
strikes at the cause of the loss.
Hooked by a Cow.
While Mrs. Mazzera, an old and re
spected resident of Volcano, was in the
act of taking the bell off a cow last
Monday morning, the animal, which
hadalways appeared docile and harm
less, suddenly hooked her with her
horn in a savage manner. The point
of the horn caught the lady in the
groin, and penetrated the abdominal
cavity. Her sons heard her screams
for help, and hurried to her assistance.
Dr. Roberts was promptly on hand,

THEAMADOE LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 31. 1902.
The Interpretation Thereof.
As a reply to the expose in last
week's Lodger of the official action in
the case of W. H. Lester, and also of
the charge of non-colltrtion of licenses
from the Morroll siiow company last
month, U S Gregory, as sheriff and
license collector has issued a circular,
and scattered the. same broadcast over
the county. We quote the circular in
full, bo far as the explanation of these
transactions are concerned:
In the Lester cattle stealing case —
the burden of the Ledger's song — one
of Allen's cattle was butchered in El-
Dorado county and as the owner of the
cow lives in Amador county and helps
to pay my salary, and fearing the ras
cal might escape before the El Dorado
sheriff could reach the scene, I went
over into El Dorado couuty and ar
rested the thief. After his arrest I
discovered that part of the beef had
been brought into Amador county and
sold. The law provides that where a
theft has been committed in one coun
ty and any part of the stolen property
has been brought into another county
and disposed of. the offense is triable in
either county. The man begged to be
given a chance to plead guilty in this
county, probably knowing the feeling
against cattlo* thieves in El Dorado,
and fearing a more severe sentence
there; out of mercy for the poor un
fortunato fellow, I consented. The dis
trict attorney aud superior judge knew
all the circumstances in connection
with the matter, and the man was
given a fair and legal trial and sent to
San Queutin, whore he paid the penalty
for his crime and is now at large, i The
editor of the Lodger knows perfectly
well that the right of habeas corpus is
still in vogue, and if there was . any ir
regularity the convicted man could
have availed himself of his legal rights
and have been released from prison at
any time. The editor Of the Ledger
admits that the man who wrote tin;
letter in connection with the case is an
entire stranger to him, and still is will
ing to besmirch tha character of a pub
lic officer on such testimony. I could
have iuforined him that the fellow is
an irresponsible, worthless vagabond,
if he had taken the pains to ask me,
and I do not think that any honorable,
upright man would charge an officer
with -vrong-doing upon such informa- '
tion from such a source.
As to the charge that no lk'euse was
collected from the Morrell Show Com
pany, it is a most unjustifiable mis
statement. The company did not
leave the county until the 4th of
October and settled with me at that
time. Had the editor of the Ledger
been fair and honorable ho would have
ascertained the truth by coming to my
office and seeing the stub forthelicense
which was paid after my settlement,
which was made on the Ist of October,
aud which will be paid into the county
treasury iv my next quarterly-settla
ment. The . fact that since my as
sumption of the duties of license col
lector that I have collected and paid
into the treasury of Amador county
more than double as much as any other
license collector ever did in a like per
iod of time, should be a complete
answer to this malicious falsehood.
U S Gregory.
We give place to the above, not at
the request of Mr. Gregory, but of our
own free motion, and for the purpose
of showing the hollowness of tho ex
planation. It is no explanation at all;
indeed, it brings into stronger relief if
possible, the damaging facts of the Les
ter case, as sot forth in the .Ledger last
week by our correspondent. Let it be
admitted that the law provides that
where personal property is stolen in
ono county, ami afterwards removed,
in whole or iv part, into another coun
ty, the case may be tried in either
county. Mr. 'Gregory says that he dis
covered* that part of the beef was
brought iuto Amador couuty and sold.
That fact is not al'eged in the com
plaint, nor is it proven or stated in any
manner in the records of the case.
Why was this fact kept in the back-,
ground. Who bought the stolen prop
erty. Why was he, to, not prosecuted
as a party to the criminal transaction.
Section 4i)tj of the penal code reads:
j Every person who for his own gain,
or to prevent the owner from again
possessing his proporty, buys or re
ceives any personal property, knowing
the same to have been stolen, is pun
ishable by imprisonment in tho state
prison not exceeding five years, or in
the county jail not ;■• exceeding six
months.
j Now, ono of the main points in our
correspondent's lbttor was that the
railroading of Lester to state prison in
the uncerinoniou* fashion adopted, was
the means of allowing an accomplice in
crime in Amador county to go unpun
ished.- Not a syllable is vouchsafed in
ventillation of this vital point. How
came it that the ono in Amador county
was not molested, but the El Dorado
man yanked into Amador county, and
sent to state prison at a2.4ogalt. "The
man begged to be given a chance to
plead guilty in this county," and so
compassion came to the rescue of tho
poor unfortunate, and he got two years
for a crime without any extenuating
circumstances that we can see, the
punishment for which is from one to
ten years. It is admitted that he would
probably have got a much heavier
sentence in El Dorado county. That is
$ho way the cattlemen of Amador coun
ty, who holp to pay the sheriff s salary,
are protected, and why the Ei Dorado
authorities were not allowed to attend
to tho case. The culprit gets almost a
minimum of punishment, and the cost
aid odium of a . crime that properly
belongs to El Dorado, are thrown upon
Amador county.
But again. Tho record shows that
U S Gregory was the only witness in
this remarkable case. Ho made the
complaint, be took the stand, and the
man was held to answer on his bare
testimony. He was at least thirty
miles away from the scene of tho crime.
What evidence— other than hearsay-^
could he give touching the essential
facts constituting the crime; such as
tho actual killiug, the ownership of the
cow.- Is this the correct precedent to
establish in criminal procedure. But
the most amazing, give-away state
ment of all is this; "The district at
torney and superior judge knew all the
circumstances in connection with the
matter." How did they know? How
could they know, except by the sworn
testimony of ' eye witnesses to the
material facts? There was no • testi
mony introduced in tho superior court,
and the evidenco of U S Gregory in the
preliminary examination was not re
duced to writing. What, then, does
he mean when tie aays, Tho district at
torney and superior judge knew all the
circumstances? We leave our readers
to solve that conundrum. Does this
not serve to prove, what the Ledger
has contended for from the outset, that
it is high time that this political com
bine was jlissolved b y t* 16 decree .of
the voters registered at the ballQt-box.
To cap the whole,' the people are told
that If illegally convicted, Lester had
a remedy by habeas corpus. What of
it? Does that excuse excess of author
ity on the part of an officer? Lester
was not kicking- He was chuckling
over his good fortune in being run into
Amador county to get a term of two
years for a crime of great enormity in
the the eyes of all cattlemen — namely,
cattle stealing. We havo yet to hear
from the cattle men how thoy relish
this merciful intervention by Amador
authorities in behalf of one caught in
very act of preying upon their business
interests. . The personal flings at tho
editor of tho Ledger we deem unworthy
of notice. Also, the hard names hurled
with/- questionable taste at our corre
spondent, A. Maron, we pass by in si
lence. But to set at rest all insinuations
as to the correctness of the facts, wo
herewith publish, a certified copy of the
record in the justico's court:
In the Justice Court of Township No. One.
County of Amador. State of California.
The People of the State of California, Plain
tiff, vs. William H. Lester, Defendant.
Action, felony, to wit, grand larceny. C P.
Vicini, attorney for plaintiff, state of Cali
fornia, county of Amador, s s. ! Personally ap
peared before me on this ill li day of September,
191X1, U S Gregory ot township No ou«. in the
county of Amador, state of California, who first
Being duly sworn, on oath, deposes, complains,
and says, the said William 11. Lester or the
county of El Dorado, state of California, on tho
18th day of September A. I>, hum. at Shake
Ridge, in the county of Amador, state afore-
Bald, committed the crime of felony, to wit,
grand larceny. The said William 11. Lester,
at the time and place aforesaid, feloniously did
kill, steal take and carry away from the
mountain ranee of the estate of George Allen,
deceased, one cow, the same being then and
there the personal property of the said estate
of George Allen, deceased, and a warrant of ar
rest having been duly issued on said 24th day
of Septcmlier, 1000
September 25, 19 ft), said defendant, William
H. Lester, having been duly arrested thereon,
and brought before this court by P. Kelly, con
stable, and after being informed of all his
rights, was duly arraigned, said his truu name
is William H. Lester, and ready for examina
tion. C. P. Vicini, district attorney, appeared
on the part of the people. The defendant did
not desire an attorney, and did not care to have
■ilie evidence to be taken down in writing. U S
Gregory was sworn, aud tostinod on the part of
the -people. The defendant did not oare'to
cross examine tLe witness. People rest. The
court asked the defendant if he has any wit
ness to introduce, and wants to make any
statement. The defendant answered that he
has no witness to introduce nor wants to make
any statement. Examination closed, and. sub
mitted to the court without argument. It ap
pearing to me that the iillcnso in the within
deposition mentioned, fclonv, to wit, grand
larceny, has been committed, <iml that there is
sufficient cause to believe the within named
William H Lester guilty thereof, I order that
he be held to answer to the same, and that he
be admitted to bail in the sum of ono thousand
dollars, and is committed to tho sheriff of. the
county of Amador. until he elves such bail.-
Dated this 25th day of September, 19W)
H. GOLDNKR,
Justice of the peace in and for said township.
I hereby certify that the withiu Is a true
copy of my docket. H. Goldner.
Now, about the show licenses, which
he says were collected after Oct. 1. and
will be reported in the next quarterly
statement. Section 9of the licenso or
dinance reads: _,
Whenever tho rate of license tax by this ordin
ance imposed is fixed at a sum for a quarter of
a year, or any other period, the liceuse tax for
the whole of such quarter of a year, or other
period, must be paid in advance.
Another part of the ordinance fixes
the license for show as follows: .
For traveling minstrels, shows, traveling dra
matic or theatrical performances * * * ja'so i>er
day, or $10 per week. . .
How comes it that this pay in advance
provision — so essential to the vitality of
the ordinauce — is no longer regarded
as obligatory. The license tax that
should have been collected f rom the
Morrell company alone boforo Oct. 1,
amounted to $40 at the weekly rate,
and considerably more at the day rate.
And yet not a dollar was reported for
the whole quarter preceding October 1.
Why were th»- interests of the county
jeopardized by a deliberate departure
from the law for the benefit of outside
license payers? To give the same ratio
of concession to resident business men
liquorllicenses would have to be collect
ed yearly.after each individual had run
up a bill of $b"0 due the county. Of
course after this ventilation, the' show
licenses referred to will figure* in the
pext statement. We were under the
impression that the Morrell company
played in lono several times after Oct..
4.' Wo could give tho reasons why rev
enue from licenses has increased. It is
due to increase of busiuess houses and
businesses subject to license. Citizens
will conclude that where such looseness
prevails as herein indicated, the fullness
of time has come to make a change.
Attempted Suicide.
A man named William Parsons was
taken to the hospital on Wednesday by
J. Tonzi of near Mount Echo. He was
suffering from a self-inflicted wound in
tho throat, made with suicidal iutent.
It seems that Parsons was formerly a
resident of near Amador City. Some
years ago he held a responsible position
at the Kennedy mine. Latterly he had
been working at the copper mine at
Camp Soco. He left there three weeks
ago,"and was journeying toward Ama
dor City. It is reported that he had
been drinking heavily, and this was
the cause of his attempt upon * his own
life. He was found wandering around
below Amador, between Amador City
and Drytown, with his thrqat cut, and
in a kind of dazed condition. The
wound had no doubt been inflicted sev
eral days before. When able to
convtM-se, he told his attendants that
.he had used a razor to 'do the work;
that he wanted to get out of the world
anyway, as he had lived long enough.
The wind-pipe was entirely severed,
but fortunately tho jugular voin was
not touched. Had that vein boon cut
he would have bled t.q death in a few
seconds. When brought" to the hos
pital ho was very weak from exposure,
lack of nourishment and loss of blood.
Dr. Gall promptly attended to his
wounds. It required" 16 stitches to
close the cut. The wind-pipe also had
to be stitched to its place. The victim
is by no means out of danger, as the
wind-pipe is njuch slower in uniting
and healing than ordinary tissue.
Parsons, notwithstanding his weakened
condition, displayed great nerve under
tho operation. He was so reduced in
strength, that it was deemed danger
ous to administer chloroform.. So the
wounds were stitched without any
anaesthetic whatever, tho patient
scarcely flinching under th.c pajnfp}
operation. ■ •

DEMOCRATIC RALLY.
A I Qua^et : of Speakers '„. Furnish _ : Oratory
I for son • and ~ Butter Creek 0 the «i
' v ' Same . Right. '. ■< i\-
The democrats made an extra effort
Tuesday night for a big "rally in; both
Jackson atfd Sutter Creek. They; ;had
to" do something-to offset' the fact' that
Lane, their nominee for governor, had
given Amador county tho" go-by, while
Pardee' had taken the trouble^to get
away from the railroad line, and visit
Jackson. So they arranged a double
meeting for Jackson and Sutter Creek
the same night, with four talkers who
were to alternate between^ the two
towns. The orators announced fur tho
occasion were James. V. : Cpleman, a
wheel-horse v of ;■ democracy, Samuel
Butler,' whuwas "billed as a member of
tho miners', uniou, also an' "Euglish
;aau, the son of a Cornish miner, who
would speak principally to tho minors."
Also Thomas J. Geary,"- former con
gressman, and author.- of the Geary
Chinese, exclusion bill, rand? hist of all
L. R. Tiillooh, nominee for state sen
ator. Bonfires, the booming of guns,
tho Jackson baud, and every effort
was made to awaken some enthusiasm.
Thero was a fair-sized crowd gathered
on:th'Bstrt?ot,"tho hall was. well filled';
but nothing' like the . mass of people
that greeted some ol the republican
turnouts at Jackson and Amador City.
There were few persons 'from "outside
the town noticed in the crowd.
James Moohan was selected as chair
man.' Half a dozen vice-presidents oc
cupied 1 seats: on -the platform. .The
first speaker was Samuel Butler of
Nevada county, who is said to be presi
dent of the miners' union there, and
whose visit ; hero was ■ intended to in
lluence.tho miners of this region to a
favorable 'regard ; for the democratic
cause. ■He is a' 'common-place " talker,
monotonous in his style, ' and : with no
claims to eloquence or oiiutory; - His
address was simply a statement of his
campaign experience,' and' a sketch' of
Lane. He showed common-sense in
omitting all reference to his being an
Englishman, and ukuUJ no mention of
the Cornish miner, as he. was evi
dently exuected 10 do by the demo
cratic managers. He' was no doubt
much* better posted on tho. character of
these miners than the politicians were,
and knew that any 'claim of influence
over them by reason of nativity would
bo resented. He said the laboring men
were interested in the campaign more
than any other class, j It was a cam
paign of local issuos, -the main issue
being the liberty of the. working man
to organize for his own protection. Ho
forgot to say tliut no ' party aud" no
candidate has uvii; taken the negative
of that proposition., •H e said ne was
glad to be informed that the miners of
Amador county had at 'last organized
for their own protection, thereby refut
ing his own statement that the right to
organize was an issue in the contest.
He wished God speed to the miners'
union of Jackson. He . had seen the
benefits of industrial organization. " He
made the broad assertion that there
was not a solitary- Chinaman in tho
city of Tacoma owing to the opposition
of Franklin K. Lane. 1 ' Mr. Bullor is
not particular about the truth. He
further said that Pardee was an enemy
to the laboring man, and rehashed a
lot of lies about the railroad strike
years ago., Butler's talk from begin
ning to end was' an effort to stir up
class prejudice; to array the employes
against the employers; -to represent
that their interests are and must be
antagonistic; and that it was necessary
for the laboring raau to keep on a war
fooling as it were by organizing against
>he employers.- He appealed . to the
miners that whatever the action, of
those above them might be, to stand"
firm.' Just fancy the gall of the man
agers of the democratic party, in their
desperation to hold on to the local of
fices, in importing men to Amador
couuty to talk in this strain to intelli
gent working men, : .'
Jas. V. Coleman was the next speaker,
and he evidently was not favorably im
pressed with the remarks of his prede
cessor, as he started out by saying that
•he thought it was a mistake to divide
people iuto two classes — laborers and
capitalists or employers. He talked
against . the modern . king called
monopoly. The democratic party was
not opposed to combinations of capital.
It is the party of progress. Its policy
was well rounded, while the republican
policy was lopsided. The danger was
in vicious combinations. • The demo
cratic, party proposed to deal even
handed justice to all, so that there
should be no more strife. The revolution
will be aucompllshod peacefully, and
the settlement will bo for. all time. He
claimed that the democracy was the
friend of the people, and republicanism
the friend of trusts and the foo of the
people. .'
Thos. J. Geary, ex-congressman, was
next called. The people had to wait
for some time, until he could get here
from Sutter Creek, and the band
played, and Cpleman afterward started
in to toll a dream to consume the time,
in the midst of which the speaker put
in an appearance. Geary is a man of
considerable intellectual force. He
made by far the ablest speech from a
democratic standpoint heard in the
county in this campaign. Ho discussed
the tariff, and maintained ■ that the
democratic party is not a free trade
party, never was, and never will be.
It was not the enemy of industry, and
did not propose to do anything to inter
fere with the prosperity of the present
time. Ho claimed that American goods
could be bought much cheaper in
foreign countries, than in the United
States, and from this reaspnod that the
protective tariflf was unnecessarily high.
They proposed to take the duty off of
trust' made goods, and the necessaries
of life, leaving what are called luxuries
to bear the burden of furnishing
revenue. He told his hearers that the
working men would never have a better
friend than the democratic party; that
it would never desert them, but failed
to shpw at any time that tho policy of
the democrats had ever resulted in
good times and prosperity.
The meeting closed with an address
by L. R. Tulloch, candidate for state
senator: To say that he astonished
his hearers is putting it mildly. . His
wild and incoherent talk was utterly
unintelligible. If he had the least Idea
pf what he was talking ' about, his
listeners certainly did not. The audi
ence was. giggling from beginning to
end of his harangue because of tho ab
sence of a clear-cut idea. It was really
pitiable.

MINING NEWS.
Zeila,— The Jioisting of- rock was
suspended the middle of this week, and
the work of repairing- the shaft has
been fairly inaugurated. The ore bins
of the mill were full of rock when ■• the
shut-down occurred,' tho ore being suf
ficient to run a week or more.*' While
the work of shaft repairing will be
prosecuted with all vigor, it is im
possible to tell accurately how long it
will take to complete. . It is thought,
however, that three months will-be
sufficient to see the work. through..
Horn.— C. M. Meek visited the Horn
mine, near the Defender,' early this
week. He reports that the work now
in hand consists in making a turn in
tho tunnel so as to connect with the 80
foot shaft. This was expected to be
finished by the first of November; after
which taking out ore for milling will
be in order. The ore body is reported
from 6 to 8 feet wideband runs from

Narrow Escape.
Jack Marchantand C. H. McKenney,
republican candidates for assessor and
assembly respectively,- had a close call
of meeting with serious injury Satur
day night. They were returning from #
the meeting at Amador City. . Tho*
night was dark, aud when opposite the
South Spring Hill hoisting works, one
of the wheels of the buggy ran over
the embankment of tho oreek. The
buggy was capsized. McKenney man
aged to jump out, but Marchant went
down with the ship into the creek. bed.
Fortunately both men escaped unhurt,
except a few slight scratches. They
were able to make the homeward trip
the same night, notwithstanding the
mishap.'

The Worst Form.
Multitudes are singing the praises of
Kodol, the new discovery which ■is
making so many sick people well and
weak people stroflg by digesting what
they eat, by cieansing and sweetening
the stomach and by transforming their
food into the kind of pure, rich, red
blood that makes you feel good all
over. Mrs. Cranfill, of Troy, •I. T.,
writes: For a number of years T was
troubled with indigestion and dyspep
sia which grew into the worst form.
Finally I was induced to use Kodol and
after using four bottles I am entirely ■
cured. I heartily recommend Kodol
to all sufferers from indigestion and
dyspepsia, Take a dose after meals.

DON.'T GET MORBID.
I». "a Not a Difficult Blatter to Thin*
Yonrself to Deatb. .
■ Thousands of people actually think
tlK mselves to death every year by al
lowing their minds to dwell on morbid
subjects.
As a rule, the thought that kills re
lates to something the individual
dreads more than anything else in the
\rcrld. There is the germ of fatal
thought in ninety-nine persons in every
hundred, and the exception Is . only
proof against the thought disease by
having been inoculated with the lymph
of optimism or philosophy.' "
| The idea that one has some incipient
disease in one's system, the thought of
fliituici.il ruin, that one is getting on hi
life without iuiproviqg prospects — any
of. ' them or a thousand similar
thoughts may carry a healthy man to
a premature • grave. A melancholy
thought that fixes itself upon one's
mind needs as much "doctoring" as
physical disease. It needs to be eradi
cated from the mind or It will have
just the same result as a neglected
disease ■ would have. The thought dis
ease sometimes cures Itself after run
ning its course; so does smallpox. But
who would settle down to suffer from
smallpox and chance recovery, as thou
sands of foojish persons settle down to
let the tßought disease, which has at
tacked them, do Its worst?
Every melancholy thought, every
morbid notion and every nagging wor
ry should be resisted to the. utmost,
and the patient should be physicked by
Iphecrful thoughts, of which there is a
store in 'every one's possession, bright
eomiKiniorifc— cheaper than drugs and
pleasanter. . .
■ ' There have occurred scores of dozens
of oases where healthy persons have
thought themselves into having rumors
and cancers— cases which admit of no
doubt whatever that the diseases re
sulted from constant morbid fear.
There might possibly be fewer cases
of cancer if some great doctors could
assure tho world that it is not a hered
itary disease, but morbid minded per
sons on hearing that there Is cancer in
their families generally jdo the very
worst thing they can <lo under the cir
cumstances — they conceive an awful
dread that they will be afflicted with
it. JThey dwell upon the fear constantly,
aud every trifling aliment which trou
ble's them. is at first mistaken for the
premonitory symptoms of cancer..
.The morbid condition of mind pro
duces a morbid condition of body, and
if the disease does happen to be in the
system it receives every j encourage
ment to develop.
POULTRY POINTERS.
The best eggs are the result of a
meat diet.
Weak legs come from forced growth,
high feeding and close confinement.
. Use no deformed or weak fowls for
breeding and do not keep the same
cock more than one season.
A molting hen seldom lays. She can
not, be supplying eggs while the strain
of growing new feathers is upon her..
A very fat hen seldom lays anything
but soft shelled eggs. Apoplexy and
egg bound are the result of excessive
fat
Leaves and hay chaff make excellent
litter for the floors, and by throwing
grain among it . fowls are often kept
busy scratching.
Keep the fowls away from the barns,
stables and carriage houses. In such
places they are nuisances; besides they
are more comfortable In a place by
themselves.
.liens must have carbonate and phos
phate of lime for' their shells, and these
will be found in old plastering, broken
oyster shells and bones, with some of
the meat and-'gristle attached.
A Persian Dinner.
A traveler in Persia thus, describes a
dinner j served in the household of p
wealthy Persian: "The chief dish con
sists of a fowl boiled to rags, surround
ed by a toothsome mass of rice, hard
boiled eggs, fried onions, almonds and
raisins. There Is a Shiraz wine, clear,
golden red liquid that has traveled
over the mountain passes on muleback
in a huge glass carboy. Among the
dessert manna has a conspicuous place.
This delicacy is somewhat akin to
nougat; it is studded with walnuts and
almonds and is jaw I sticking to the
last degree. Like the mango, it ls best
eaten in private, for it renders the mas
ticator speechless. It is made of gum
that exudes from a tree and is said to
bo engendered by a worm."— Chleago
Fertile Cuba.
In Cuba cabbages .frequently weigh
as much as twenty pounds. All vege
tables do well. Radishes may be eaten
from fourteen to eighteen days after
sowing, lettuce in five weeks after
Bowing, while corn produces three
crops per year. Sweet potatoes are
,-perpetual. The natives dig "up the
tubers, cut them off and plant the old
vines, which produce a new crop In
three months. All sorts of fruit, hortl
rultural and greenhouse plants and
bulbous stock are also grown.

sick persons should expect to be
cored by food. When your stock
