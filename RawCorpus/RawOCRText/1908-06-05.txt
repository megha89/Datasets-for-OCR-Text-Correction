Narrow Escape.
M. M. Niohol met with an adven
ture last Monday, which fortunately
was unattended witb serious conse
quences, lie was working on bis
brother J. J. Niohol's place near
Pine (Jrovo. The two were engaged
In harvesting operations, hauling hay
from tbe Hold. The hay wagon was
loaded on a steep hillside, which re
quired a band on tbe upper side to
prevent it from capsizing. When tbe
load was ou, tbe horses pulled the
wagon beyond the steadying band on
tbe uppou side, and in au instant tbe
wngou turned a somersault down tbe
bill. M. Nichols was on tbe wagon
at tbe time, and jumped to save bim
self. He roiled some twenty or
thirty feet down the declivity, but
esbaped with a few bruises. The
horses went clean through a barbed
wire fence, breaking down several
posts, and strange to say they also
escaped witb slight injuries. ' The
wagon was somewhat demoralized,
and will take about 915 to restore',
it to former condition.
Masonic Band Concert.
The concert and dance to be given at
dove's hall on Wednesday, June 10th,
by tbe boys' band of the Masonic
Home at Deooto, under tbe auspices
of tbe Masonic fraternity and Eastern
IStar, is In tbe nature of au outing for
the boys, as well as a means of re
plenishing the band fund. As tbe
cause is iv every way a • worthy oue,
we trust tbat the lovets ot musio and
of tbe terpsicborean art will be well
represented, so as to show that we
know how to appreciate a good thing
and a good time when they come our
way.
Ball Game Sunday.
Last Sunday a baseball team from
Volcano and the Jaokson nine met on
the local grounds with the result that
the visitors went away witb very
soreheads, for they were beaten by
the close soore of 8 to C. ' From the
first few innings it looked that the
game would bo very much closer than
it was. Fryer of Electra pitched for
the Volcano team, and with exception
of oue inning, he'd the Jackson boys
down very well. Sockoy played his
usual game but lacked tbe support of
his team. The Volcano team had
been gathered from various places, so
that they wore tbe hardest proposi
tion that tbe local team has run up
against this season. Every little
thing whh contested by both toams,
the result being that the game was
full of wiangliug. ln«the last inning
tbe score stoqd li to 0 in favor of
Jackson, but tbe Volcano boys got a
move on themselves aud piled up
three more In short order. Tbe score
was «Q close that there is talk of rais
ing a purse of $100 or more, for tbe
tennis to piny on some outside
ground, probably lone. lliia gives
promise of being oue of the best
games ot the seasou.
Thoro is moro catarrh in this section
of the country than all other disuuaos
put together, and until the lust few
years was supposod to be Incurablo.
For a great many years doctors pro
nounced It a local disease, and proscrib
ed local remedies, and by coDstuntly
falling to euro with local treatment,
pronounced It Incurable. Science has
proven catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and tlmrofi.ro requires consti
tutional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
Cure, manufactured by F. J. Cheney
& Co., Toledo, Ohio, is tbe only consti
tutional cure on the market. It Is taken
Internally In doses from 10 drops to a
teaspoonful. It acts directly on thu

now operating the Defender Aline
under agreement with the (Jold Kldge
Mining Co., is very well satisfied
with the ptospeots at Defender. It is
always pleasing to us to road local
items about tbe property, which we
believe will bear writing up. A
good many Amador people are Inter
ested in this proporty, through owner
ship of Cold Kldge stock. lam en

gives an abstract of Turner's and
Wolfe's reports on the property.
Kinco then a practical consolidation
of tbo properties has taken jilmio,
although separate organizations are
maintained. We are now studying
conditions, and plan to install proper
equipment as soon as we are able to
determiue what tbat may be. In tbo
meantimo we are employing a dozen
men at the mine, aud hoisting and
milling upwards of ton tons a day.
It is our opinion tbat the combined
claims will justify th 9 erection of a
forty stamp mill.

have been laid before tnree of tbe
best known mining engineers in
America, one of whom has a groat
record in California, who have not
hesitated to pass very encouraging
and satisfactory commeuts upon tho

Baseball— lone vs. Jackson.
The baseball nine composed of

last Sunday and played a game there
with tho business men of that town,
heating (hem them by tho score of 20

team were Uoo. Endicott, who twirlod
tbe ball, while Charley Vicini caught
them, Mcl Ford held down tbe first
cushion, Frank Arata second, Kinil
Maroucoi on third, and Bob Korr a
short, in the Hold were Gilbert Voor
heis and Uua Liaverone, in left aud
right field respectively, while John
Gaibarini was in tbe center., Uoo.
developed into quite a pitcber,
throwing a slow ball which the lones
tound rather hard to hit, but his
iirm gave out and needed a rest, so
Voorheis was culled in trom the Held
and giveu tbe ball. During that inn
ing the louos piled up sevon runs,
which accounts for tbe score beinu so
closo at tbe end of tbe game. A re
turn game will probably be played
here in a couple of weeks.

MINING IS A BUSINESS, NOT A GAMBLE.
Notwithstanding that mining is an industry as old 'as hu
man civilization,it is* strange what crude and ofttimes errone
ous impressiono n are entertained, even at the present time,
•outside of the communities where the industry is carried on,
concerning the business of gold mining. It is probable that
a vast majority of those living in non-mining communities
who are accustomed to invest their surplus capital in gold
quartz mines, are densely ignorant of nature's methods
of operation in the deposition of gold in its native matrix —
quartz: — and the processes invented by man for the extraction
of the precious metal from its rocky bed. The vast difference
between placer mining and quartz mining is not fully un
derstood by many who live in manufacturingcenters but who
are in the habit of investing in gold ventures because of the
immense returns they hold for the amount of capital in
vested. Men have been made rich in an hour by stumbling
across a pocket of gold hidden away sometimes in gold-bear
ing gravel and sometimes in quartz. These are facts that
strongly appeal to. the uninitiated, and induce them to get in
on some highly colored ground-floor proposition engineered
for the express purpose of extracting money from the pockets
of these over-credulous people. This is the gambling, the
speculative side of the gold-mining industry, and must be
classed as distinct from the business aspect. It is by appeal
ing to the speculative spirit that the wildcat schemes of new
mining fields are made to flourish. They are designed not to
extract gold from the earth, but to delve into the hard-earned
savings of persons far removed from the ground by inducing
them to buy stock in gold-mines* that exist mainly in the im
agination of unscrupulous promoters. As a rule, it is much
easier to make money by this sort of fake mining, than it is
by the actual exploration of the earth's crust in a honest
search after buried treasures. Very few persons conversant
with the practical side of mining are caught by these wild
cat propositions, except as a gamble. They speculate in the
expectation of making money in the buying and selling of
stock in such concerns, and not by the hope of dividends de
clared from the output the claims.
It may be questioned whether this wildcatting in the long
run is any real help to legitimate mining. The discovery of
of a prospective gold mine in a new field is always attended
with more or less excitement, and the consequent inrush of
prospectors and adventurers. The field is pretty thoroughly
exploited. For every claim staked out for actual mining,
there is usually a score or more taken up for wildcatting pur
poses. The losses incurred by the swindling operations of
the latter tend to discourage investment in the legitimate
business, not only in the newly discovered regions, but also
in the old fields which have been surrendering gold for gen
erations past, and which are not afflicted to any extent with
. the methods of the wildcat operator.
• Amador county is not attracting, at the present time, the
interest from investors which her proven mineral riches
should entitle her to receive. Prospecting operations have
lagged behind for several years, although the extent of the
mineralized virgin territory is admittedly large, and the pros
pect of finding rich ore bodies therein is 3s encouraging as
can be found anywhere. Moreover, the fact that our gold
ledges penetrate to greater depths than has been proven else
where on the American continent should act as a spur to de
velopment work here. In the Kennedy mine gold is being ex
tracted in liberal quantities at a depth of over 3000 feet from
the surface, with no signs of exhaustion even at this gr,eat
depth. There are other mines producing gold from below
2500 feet. Such permanence in gold deposits is found no
where else on the globe, so far as actual experience has dem
onsstrated, unless it be in the goldfields of the Transvaal in
South Africa. This wonderfully rich belt is bound to com
mand its due share of attention sooner or later.
Congress has adjourned, after passing a compromise cur
rency measure, in spite of the fillibustering tactics resorted
to by Senator La Follete of Wisconsin, who succeeded in
making the longest speech on record in his effort to defeat
it.

PLUG HATS OF JAPAN.
Cherlrtied Tile* of the Vintage of Fifty
Yeari Ago.
"There 13 one s!«ht whirli you mtißt
Hot miss when you pro to Tokyo." suld
tbe seasoned trnveler to n New York
Sun reporter. "Thnt la the rnre dis
play of anthropological p'"tf hats.
"Some iwople nrrnnge to get to Japan
In cherry blossom Reason, nnd others

"When Jr.pan began to get civilized

ilization that Kngland did not want
any more. England sold her old fash
ioned, out of date, narrow gauge rail
road stock, antiquated tram cars and
other secondhand Junk, including tho
then current styles of plus bat.
"The tile of those days hns remain
ed the ruling fashion In Japan up to
the present. Japan may build Dread
noughts, but the plug bat of fifty
yeara ago still reigns supreme.
"Only on such ceremonious occasions
«b the New Year's festivities, the em
peror's birthday or possibly the racing
meets at Ncgishl, near Yokohama, does
tbe Japanese gentleman bring forth
from his camphor wood chest his plug
tint, a heritage from his forefathers.
It may be warped with twenty sum
mers, damp or green with the shine of
nntiqulty, but that matters nothing.
. "Once this superstructure of his
wrinkled frock coat and bagged trou
sers is added the Japanese gentleman
feels that no dignity short of a decora
tion of tho Order of the Rising Sun
can be added to his person. That
crowning glory of a plug hat may set
tle around his ears or it may perch
upon his head like half a peanut shell,
but no matter. It Is therhat of civiliza
tion and the badge of respectability.
"He trots out of his house looking
like one of the ancient dalmios, stiff
with tbe dignity of two swords. All
that fearful day he wears this hat of
ancient vintage like a crown, and In
the end he stows it away in his damp
proof chest, awaiting another festal
occasion or held as an asset in his es
tate after death."
AN INDIAN GREETING.
Tho Salutation a Canadian Heard on
the Columbia River.
Telling about the Indians of the Pa
cific coast as he found them in 1840,
Paul Kane, the Canadian artist, tried
to give an idea of their language as he
found it at that time. The example
which he quotes would have delighted
Max Muller, and It may interest some,
readers in this country. In his "Wan
derings of an Artist" he seems not to
recall any particular individual of the
name of Clark who might have iui
•pressed the Indians of the Columbia
river, but American readers will at
once think of the comrade of Major
Lewl3 in the famous expedition of
1803.
I would willingly give a specimen of
the barbarous language of this people
were it possible to represent by any
combination of our alphabet the hor
rible, harsh, splattering sounds which
proceed from their throats, apparently
unguldeil either by the tongue or lip.
say.s Mr. Kane. It is so dillicult to ac
quire a mastery of their language that
none have been able to attain it ex
cept those who have been born among
them.
They have, however, by their inter
course with the English and French
traders* succeeded in amalgamating
after a fashion some words of each of
these tongues with their own and in
forming a sort of patois, barbarous
enough certainly, but still sufficient to
enable them to communicate with the
traders.
This patois I was enabled after some
short time to acquire and could con
verse with moat of the chiefs with tol
erable ease.
Their common salutation Is "Clak-hoh
ali-yah." originating, as 1 believe, in
th6lr ancestors having heard In the
early days of the fur trade a gentle
man named Clark frequently addressed
by his friends, "Clark, how are youV"
This salutation Is now applied to ev
ery white man. for their own language
affords no appropriate expression.—

Jackbou, Gal.Amador County
Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises an area of
US square miles. It lioa on tho west
torn sloiro of Sierra Novacio. mountains,
nnd embraces within its territory all
tho diversity of valloy, foothill, find
liinh mountainous lands.
Climate.— Tho cllinato of tho popu
lous portions of tho county Is as genial
and healthful as can bo found anywhere
In California. As cllmato Is ono of tho
most valuable assets of this favored
stnlo in attracting 1 population, Amador
stands second to no county in this re
gard. It should, and no doubt will in
time, when its climatic advantages an;
more thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, become a hoalth resort not
only for those In loss favored states,
but for tho residents of other parts of
California. Tho temperature alone tho
central portion rarely falls below 30
degrees above zero In winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees in the sum
mer. Snow soldom falls In tho settled
districts, and novor romaing on the
ground for more than a fow hours. Of
courso, In the high mountain regions
of eastern Amador tho snowfall is very
heavy— which Is characteristic of the
entire Sierra Nevada range. Tho sum
mer season is alway accompanied with
uool nights; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs are rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
Infrequent.
Gold Mining.— The county, although
rich In other sources of wealth, com
paratively untouched, Is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. Tho
deepest gold mines in America are lo
cated hore. The Kennedy mine Is now
taking gold in llboral quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
2000 feet below tho surface, with every
indication that tho pay-ore extends to
■a much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold, tho county has contrib
uted fully $100,000000 to the world's
supply of tho precious metal. The
mines aro still yielding at the rate of
about two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
eight or ten mines operating on what
Is called the "mother lode," stretching
clear across the county In a north.-east
erly ' direction a distance of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate betweon
400 and 500 stamps, and furnish em
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
Industry Is still in Its infancy. The
unexplored territory, even along the
main gold belt, is far In excess of tho
ground that has actually been worked
or prospected. The county offers to
day one of tho most inviting fields to
' be found anywhere in the world for the
investment of capital in the fascinating
business of gold mining, notalono along
the mother lode, but also in the almost
untouched mineralized country ot the
east belt, some ton or twelve miles from
the main lode.
Besides gold, wo have copper, de
posits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
limestone, granite, and soapstone or
talc— all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities.— Tho agri
cultural possibilities equal, If not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce anything that can be
grown in the most favored sections.
In the foolhill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetable are raised where irrigation
is practicable along the numerous water
courses. Further up In tho mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2000, feet, the
soil is admirably adapted for apples
and potatoes. A ready market for
many times tho quantity now raised of
these commodities can be found lin the.
various mining towns.
Grape culture and wlnemaklng are
becoming important industries, both
tho grapes and winu commanding a
better price than (the product of tho
lowland.
Land Is cheap compared with other
California lands. Improved farms may
be secured for one-fourth the price
■current In somo placos. Unimproved
lands can be hud from $5 to 810 pur
-acre. It does not require a fortune to
buy a small rapch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agrlculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts now devoted to
cattle ranges might bo made the homes
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amudor has a populasion of less than
12000. Three fourths of this is concen
trated in a strip of three miles above
and below the mineral bolt.
Jackson, the county seat, has about
2500 inhabitants, and isan Incorporated
city ol the sixth class. Other towns
aro Sutter Creek, Amador City, Dry
town, Plymouth, Volcano, Pine Grove
and Oleta. lone City is the metropolis
of the valley section, a thriving town
of 1000 inhabitants.
The community Is law-abiding. Edu
cational facilities are exeellont. A
echoolhouse Is within easy roach of
nearly every family. There is ono high
school, located at lone.
The assessment roll for 1007 isss.
800,703, and tho tux rate for both stute
and county purposes $2 ou tho $100.
The Southern Pacific has a branch
railroad running to lone. From this
point the lone and Eastern railroad ex
tends 14 miles further to tho mining

Dimmer. Her dowdlnoss Is n thing to
make elegant elderly ■ Amcrlcnn women

pared with her French prototype.
From being a plump, silver voiced
enchantress she changes to nn un

ness.
This elderly Frenchwoman mny be a
dowager duchess from the Faubourg
or tho cherished spouse of your grocer.
The typo Is the same.
The fact Is that the French nre nn
eminently prnctlcnl. not to sny mate
rial, race, nnd tho Frenchwoman Is the
very embodiment of these nntlonal
idiosyncrasies.
"What Is the use," they would argue,
"of running up bills for dresses and
whnt not when there Is no chnnce of
any longer pleasing? Why not enjoy
the pleasures of the table, even If your
waist assumes alarming proportions,
when they nre the only pleasures left?
Why try to speak In dulcet tones when,
as everybody knows, it is the grand
mother who has always the final word
in the French family and, whatever
the timbre of her voice, her family will
be sure to listen to it?"
This frank acceptation of old age
and all that It implies Is not without
its advantages, nnd. Nt any rate, you
are spared In Parisian society tho spec
tacle thrtt Is too familiar In other lands
of grandmothers still dancing la span
gled tulle.— London Sketch.
THE CAPTAIN'S PLAN.
His Rule For Fighting Seasickness
Didn't Work Both Ways.
A young woman who recently made
a trip to Europe decided to consult
the captain of the ship as to the best
preventive for seasickness. Having
armed herself with v letter of Intro
duction to the officer, she waited until
the ship had cleared Sandy Hook, says
a writer in the Bohemian, and then
approached him. She described her
fears and begged for a remedy.
"My dear lady." replied the captain,
with an amused smile, "you will not
be troubled with any Illness if you will
do what I tell you. Most Indies con
fine themselves to their staterooms and
thereby incur the very thing they fear.
Now, If you will stay on deck, get all
the fresh air you' can. walk up nnd
down, take good physical care of your
self and try not to think of trouble you
will never be seasick."
The lady thanked him. She followed
the directions faithfully, and when the
ship ran into the tail end of a heavy
northwest gale she never felt a qualm.
She appeared regularly at meals and
enjoyed herself thoroughly.
As the gale was abating she be
thought her that it was due the cap
tain that she should thank him for his
good advice and, approaching the deck
steward, intrusted him with a message
asking for an interview. In due time
the steward returned, saying that the
captain was unable to grant her an
Interview.
"Why not?',' she questioned. "Why
won't he see me?'
"Captain's compliments, miss," said
the steward, "but he's suffering with a
bit of seasickness which 'as lasted
two days now, an' he ain't in shape to
talk to you."
Saluting the Quarter Deck.
Ono of the oldest customs in th«
navy nnd one that Is often puzzling to
the landsman is that of "saluting the
quarter deck." Many have the hazy
Idea that the national colors are its
object and that It Is merely a naval
fad. While to a certain extent It Is a
fad. it is one of hoary antiquity, be
ing a survival of the days when a cru
cifix was placed on tho stern of a ship
and was always saluted as a matter
of course. When the crucifix was taken
away the old feeling still remained,
and men continued to salute the place
where It had been. The younger gen
eration imitated their elders, and the
salute became a habit and continues
until this (Jay.— Los Angeles Times.
A Cold Night In China.
One of the facts that lneffaceably
cut into my memory during my first
winter In Newchwaug was the fiudlng

was a good bit below zero. The men

they had been enjoying themselves.

THE NEWEST NEW HAT
My scat!
Where did she get that bat?
Who ever ■ ,
Invented a lady's lid
Like that?
Who had the nerve to roll it out
And stretch it more and more.
From centerpiece to rim, until
It spreads from shore to shore.
And likewise litta its summit up,
On birds' and other wings,
Above the earth until it scrapes
The clouds and other things?
Who added to its wondrous width
Of brim, so that the space
Could easily accommodate
An automobile race?
Hay, who done that?
Who built her hat?
Who made it something never seen
On earth or in the sky.
A flat ot wide-extended plain,
A mountain towering high?
Cut wider doors for her to get
Inside of any place,
And put the ceiling on the roof
To give her nodding space,
J'nali up the clouds to let her stand
Ktoet upon the ground,
And shove the wide horizon back
To let her turn around.
Ob, weirdly witobing, woozy hat
That Hattens out and towers—
Who ever saw a thing like that —
A pancake tilled with flowers?
A hat contagious— spreading? Yes.
That names the Merry Wid. ;
And she who fails to catch it should
Hiip out and change her lid,
(Joe whizl
What a wonder woman ist
And my scat!
Wheie did she get that hat?

E. B. MOORE FOR THE ASSEMBLY.
We are pleased to announce nuthora
tively that W. U. Moore of Coppero-
Dolis, will be a candidate for nomina
tion tor the assembly, before the re
publican district convention of the
eleventh assembly district, composed
of the counties of Amador, Alpine,
Mono and Calaveras. This will be
good news to those who wish to see
this district ably and honestly repre
sented in the- assembly, ijo far as we
have been able to learn there is no
other candidate and Mr Moore will
most probably be the nominee.
To those who know Mr Moore per
sonally and of his honorable reoord
of forty years in this and Amador
counties there is no need of any ex
tended recommendation at our hands.
And probably there are few men
within the limits of the assembly dis
trict who are better known or who
have more personal friends than Mr
Moore. He is a man of the people,
with that sturdy integrity and rugged
honesty that characterized the pio
neers who made California. No man
would dare approach jEd. Moore with
an unworthy proposition and no one
would presume to impose on his
credulity a hidden purpose with a
plausible surface. His wide experi
enoe with men of affairs, has given
him the right kind of training to
meet on equal terms the men who
make the laws, both in the legis
lative halls and in the lobby.
Calaveras will be proud to'give to
this man a loyal support, for he has
always been a loyal friend to the
county, believing in its people and
its capability for development always
ready to lend his support and give of
hin time and means to any project
that promised to the betteiment of
the county or the prosperity of the
people, and we can ask our neigh
boring counties to join in this sup
port, feeling that with confidence
we (iau promise them they will make
no mistake and have no occasion to
regret his election to the assembly.

How to Keep Healthy.
Keep obeerful. Hunting trouble
ruiijH more nurvuu tlsan trouble when
it is touud.
Keep alert minded. There is noth
ing like getting in a mental rut to
nmko one a hypochondriac
Keep cleuu. The close connection
of the pores of the skin and good
health in beiug better understood
yeurly.
Keep active. The inert, lazy woman
who won't exercise is usually the one
who is always growling about her
health.
Keep your feet warm. More cold is
tauen through the ankles than in any
other way, so do not wear low shoes
all winter.
Keep out of debt. If there is any
thing warranted to worry one to
death it is money troubles. Care will
even kill the nine lived oat mid what
gives more care than a luincli of debts
with no iiionoy to pay tbemr
Keep awuv from drugs. The fond

ration is v meuaoe to the health of
the race. We deserve everythlug bad

AUKUM.
June 'I— There is but little news
that has transpired here that would
make interesting reading.
Harvesting is now in full blast.
The crops are a fair average.
Your correspondent paid Placerville
a visit for a few days last week. The
city appears to be in normal condi
tion. While there I met my esteemed
friend the editor of the Republican,
who was born, reared and educated
near here. When be took hold of tbe
Kepublioan, be oanie from the school-
room as a teacher. The paper wa^a
then run by a man named Selkirk,
whom I knew in Auburn in 1870. lie
was then editing a paper there, the
name of which has escaped my mem
ory. The Republican when Mr Kicb
ardson took bold of it was practically
ran down. Mr Kiobardson took
charge of it as an amateur, and has
come out as an expert, and the paper
is on a paying basis, his hair is
turning a little silvery,, and time in
its ravages - is creeping on to make
him a veteran editor. Besides giving
bis patrons a clean sheet, he has
prospered financially. Me has a tint)
home and a prosperous business. So
much for perseverance and push.'
in a conversation with a man who
had previously been a miner of El
Dorado county, be said that iv bis
.tramp in portions of tbe state that a
great many men wero out of employ
ment, lie also said that the railroad
company allowed men out ot emploj
nieut to ride free upon box aud flat
cars when they desired to leave any
locality. £Of course this applies
principally to what are denominated
.tramps, and perhaps thoso men mil,
having families hunting work, i/l'bis
then is a political dodge, which bids
for patronage iv the way of votes.
Taft may have a walk-over, but I
'.doubt it. it is a still hunt by com
bined capital. It would not surprise
me to see a general break-up in both
conventions. The unaccountuble^may
occur. In 1859 Lincoln would not
have been elected if it had not heeu
for tbe split up generally of parties,
if Douglas bad stayed out of tbe race
brickentidge would have been presi
dent. If lirickenridge hud stayed out
of the race Douglas would have been
president. There would have been no
chance for either Bill or Lincoln.
So tbe unexpected occurred aud Lin
coln was elected. The discontent and
defeat of tbe southern democracy pre
cipitated tbe civil war. Kesults may
be expected both in and out of the
conventions. It is v war to tbe hilt
of combine capital against tbe admin
istration or its policy.

After speuding sovernl ' years In a

As the plans aud specitlontlona of
the projected building are not yet
made public, it la not possible to

from what has been learned by the
writer, it is to be built in a com
bination of Komtin and Swiss styles,
and tbe grounds will be laid out In
such a manner that each of tho
twelve families occupying the ap
partments may bavo its own private
garden.
The plan of Edward iiellamy will
bo followed by tbe occupants, and
all will cooperate iv one large
kitchen, which will be situated iv
tbe basement. The ladies of each
apartment taking turn in presidium
over the culinary department. Mr
Waltensplel expectH to pay Jaokson ti

of tbe plan into operation.
There are many more details of tbe
building which have leaked out, but
as they are not verified the writer
will wait until later to give the
Ledger readers a ' more complete de
scription of Mr Waltenspiel's philan
thropic scheme.
Gus is pretty busy these days, and
can be seen daily on the streets with

Shooting Scrape.
A shooting' affair took place last
.Sunday on the old Clark ranch one
mile south of town. The place
belongs to Geo. Thomas, who had a
negro named Charles . Lindsey, who
occupied tbe dwelling house tboreon
with bis wife. It seems that another
negro named Williams bad been visit
ing tbo place at times, and -a feeling
of jealousy arose between the men.
Sunday morning Williams called
again, and was told to leave by
Llndsey. According to report Lind
sey was undei the influence of liquor.
Williams did uot leavo as promptly
as the tho man wanted so Liudsey
brought out a rifle, and fired one or
two shots, to Hcare him, "us bo says, at
a distance of several hundred yards.
Tbe shots went wild. Moth men
were arrested, aud a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon was lodged
against Lindsey. He was without uu
attorney and without money. He did.
cot deny tiring. Ho conoluded to
plead guilty Thursday morning, and
will "be sentenced Monday. The
penalty for tbis offense is from one
to five years in the penitentiary.

Mr Wilson recently purchased for
an eastern company of promoters the

It is the iutontiou of tbe company

THE LOST
BAG OF SILVER
M. B. Thrasher
A man walking along a shaded
country road which led down to the
Vermont bank of the Connecticut
rivet stopp'cd beside n post from
which a rusty .tin dinner horn waa
hanging. He took the horn trom its
hook and blew it, loud nud long, the
blast wtllob he set out ovor the rcntor
being echoed back frr>m the New
Hampshire bills.
Thoro was a little brown bouse on
the opposite sldo of tbe river, shaded
by elm trees, and sot well up tbe
bank, so as to he abovo high water
mark when tbe spring aud tall freshets
flooded the vnlley. This was the
l'nrrymnu'ri borne, aud the tin horn
was his telephone.
A young man came out ot the
House, ian down to the WHter's edge,
and stepping into a stout, flat
bottomed river boat began to row
across the river. The current was no
strong he beaded tbe small boat
diagonally up stream to counteract
its force. Tbo man who had blown
tbe horn came down to tbe river's
edge on that side and waited for him.
The boat had just started on its re
turn trip when tbe passenger, sitting
in the stern of- the boat, said, looking
aoroas the liver: "There's more bual
ness for you."
Tne boy who was rowing twisted
arouud in bis seat to look. A man
and shepherd dog were driving a flock
of sheep down the road past tbo ferry
man's house.' Another man walked
behiud them, leading a borso hitched
to a Concord wagon.
"My," said the boy, "I'm glad 1
didn't get that job. Sheep are tbe
worst things to bring across. They
are always getting soared and jumping
overboard. Father baa run tbia ferry
for thirty yours, and I've heard him
say many times that he bad rather
take over twenty teams than one flock
ot sheop. Tbe pay don't amount to
anything eitbor; only just a cent a
head."
The big ferryboat, a flat, shallow
scow, lay against the bank beneath
tho house, just where the road seemed
to disappear in the rivur. The ferry
man coming down from the house,
helped to get tbe sheep on board.
One of tbe men went ou board first,
shaking a wooden measure of oats.
A fat cosset jumped after him, and
then, one having gone ou board, all
the other sheep scurried after - their
leador. Once on board they huddled
close to each other. in the front end of
tbe boat, tbe man watching them on
one side and tbe dog on ' tbe other.
The other man led the horse on board
still hitched to the wagon. The ferry
man fished up trom tbe river bed a
atout wire ropo.firmly fasteud to each
bank, aud slipping it over some pul
leys at tbe boat's side began to pull
tbe load across the stream.
The two boats would have patsed
each other in tbe middle of tbo river.
The boy was keeping the rowboat well
up stream, so that it should not come
near enough to tbe large boat to
frighten the dumb ■ passengers on the
latter. ,
Suddenly there came tbe sound of a
"souze" in tbe water.
"There," the boy said, "1 told you
BOl"
One of tbe sbeep bad takeu fright
and jumped overboard. The uurrent
of the river boro her down stream, aud
eaob minute put her further from tho
ferryboat.
"She won't drown," said the boy.
"A sheep cau swim for quite a dis
tauue, aud besides their wool keeps
them afloat at first. I suppose I shall
have to go out iv a small boat aud
catch her," he udded, "aud tow her
ashore."
"Uo now if you want to," said the
passenger, "I'm iv uo hurry."
"Shall I row after her, father?" the
boy shouted across tbe water.
"I suppose you might us well," was
the answer.
The rowboat dropped down stream
Bwiftly under the united furce of tbe
oars and tbe current. Just as it swept
past tbe bow of the large boat tbo
Jiorse on board the latter threw up his
bead with a snort of tear and backed,
until tbe hind wheels of tbe wagon
went over tbe low side of the shallow
boat into tbe water.
The man who bad been holding tbe
horse when they first came ou board
tha boat had left him when tbe sheep
bad jumped overboard. Now he sprung
to tho horse's boad, and seizing hold
of the bridle kept tbe animal lroni
going further. The man who bad been
helping tend tbe sheep sprang to help
tbid man bold tbe horse. In the ex
citement two more sheep jumped over
board. Tbe hind wheels of the wagon
and half the body were dragging iv
tbe water.
"Save my bug I" tbe man who had
been holding the horse cried, aa ho
Bpraug back to tbe animal's head.
"My bag under tbe waguu seat I" he
said, adding, "It has got a hundred
dollars iv money iv it!"
The ferryman let the wire fall into
tbe pulleys aud rushed to the wagou.
Tbe boy in the rowboat, who had
stopped Iv his ohase after thu sheep
as Boou us tbe trouble on the boat be-
Ran. towed up to the ntern of the big
boat. Doth worn too late. The bng
had been in the bottom of the wngon.
Jhe money had been silver. It naa
gone now, out of night beneath tie
water of tho Connecticut river.
It wiih nn 3 . hour before the sheep
buyer had his flock brought together
again. Wltli the help of theboy and
the man in the small boot the wagon
waa got^baclc into tho scow, nod In
timo the throe swimming sheep wore
captured inul returned tn the flock.
Hnfore the man started thu Hook up
the road leading from tbo ferry ou tho
Vermont aide nf the river, he turned
to the boy who had been rowing.
"Can you swim," he naked.
"Yoa, sir," snld the boy.
"Aud dlvoY"
"Yes.'-»*
"Woll, if you cao llnd that bag of
mino I'll divide the money in it with
you. How deop ia tho river here?"
Tbe boy turned to hla father.
"Nigh on to twenty feet out there,
1 reckon," tho ferryman eaid.
"Humph," said the man, "1 gueas
you won't find it. If you do, though,
keep halt the money, and sond tbe
rest to ii.d. My address la ,"
giving the name of a town in tho wes
tern part of tho state. ',
"Father," said the boy. as be helped
pull tbe scow hank across tbe etieam,
the rowboat trailing behind, "can you
tell just about where the boat was
when that wagon tipped up and the
bag went out?"
"lguo.su so," the man aaid, and a
few minutea later added, "it was nigb
about here."
The boy marked the spot by making
a scratch ou tbe rope aa it ulid through
"You going out to try and find that
bag?" the ferryman naked, aa the
scow's square end slid up on the
Bandy bank below the house.
"Yes," said the boy, "I'll look
out."
"1 guess I better go with you then.
Go get ready, and I'll wait here."
The boy scrambled up the path to
tbe houHP. In a few minutes he ciirne
back, stripped, except for a pair of
light breeches .such aa divers weur.
Horn there by the .liver, aa John
Wright had benn, and brought up to
spend half his time, when the river
was not frozen, upon its surface, the
boy swam and dove like an otter.
. "Here's the place," he said when
tbe Boratch on the wire rope slid into
The bout was halted, and tbe boy
poised' himself on the stern with hia
handa above his head, as nearly as he
and hid father could reckon juat over
tbe spot where the bag had been lost.
"Us cateful you don't come up
under the boat," his father said.
"Yes, suid the boy, "I'll look out.
The slim whito body doubled in the
air. There was a splash, aud he was
out of sight. When be came up, blow
ing, the cm rent had carried him sev
eral feet dowu stream, tie swam back
to tbe scow and climbed on board to
get breath for another dive.
Again and again be went down, the
boat being moved a little each time,
and eaob time he came back empty
banded, except that once he brought
up a handful of gravel, to show that
he had reaohed tbe river bottom.
"It's no use," he said at last. "The
current Is too strong. Even with all
that weight in it the bag has gone
downstream. Do you suppose it would
stop anywhere? Do you suppose it
would stop in that eddy down there?'
be added, pointing to a plane near tho
bunk some little distance downstream
where a piece of driftwood waa slowly
circling arouud and around.
"Maybe. You can't tell anything
about tho undercurrents here. Want to
try it down there?"
"Yes," said the boy.
Tbe scow was pulled ashore, and the
two rowod down stream in the small
boat to tbe eddy. 'I be boy dove two
or throe times, but without success.
The water wus not so deep there.
That night after supper John went
out. and sat on tbe bank and looked
at the rivor and thought. Suddenly
ho got up aud wont to tbe bouse, to
where the ferryman nut on the door
step reading.
"Father." bo said, "what else did
that drover say waa in tbe bag be
sldos the money?"
"Pair of sheepßbears. "
"Did you see tbo bag?"
"1 just noticed it, sitting in the
wagon there, uh be led tbe team to
tbe boat. It was a brown leather hand
bag, about as big as that old ono your
brother bid left here."
"Do you know how much a hundred
dollars In silver weigh?"
. "Ob, nothing. 1 was just thinking."
A few minutes later tbe young man
might have been heard turning over
old ecrapirou in tha opeu chamber
over the woodshed. When he came
down he had a worn loatbei satchel m
one hand, a pair ot rusty shears in the
other. Leaving these in the woodshed
be mouutod his wheel aud rode otl in
the direction of the village.
Kd Wright, John's older brother, was
a Klerk in tbe village store.
"Kd," his brother said, waiting until
there wan no oue else iv the store, "1
want to know how much a huudred
Uollura iv silver would weigh."
AMADOU JiEDGEHt JACKSON, CAL.
"No matter what for, I Just want to
know."
Tho older brother opened tho money
rlrawet and counted out ton dolls?*
in halves and uunrleni, and dropped
tho money Into the ecoop of t.lin scales
which tested -on tho counlor. "Weigh
tboHe," he said, "and then multiply
it by ten."
John weighed Ihn silver, ami tbon
llgured fur a minute on a pleco of
wrapping paper on the counter.'
Them wns a set of fnioior's scales in
thn back kitchen of the fferryman's
luiuse. After John reached home ho
piled old Ihillh, nuts, anything, into
tbe scoop of these scales until ha had
got a maaa that would weigh in
weight the hundred dollars in silver.
This lot of old iron he slid into the
leather satchel which he had found,
and theu put the shoop-shoars In on
top. Aa tbe . luck on tho bng wiih
broken, he tied tbe mouth of tbe bag
together soouroly, so that it could
not I) v any obaoce coino open. Then
ho tied thirty ot forty foet of stout
fish line to tho handle of the bag,
and fasteuod a olonti uew sbinglo to
tbe opposite end of the lino.
It was night by this time, but nut
dark, for tbore waa a full moon" and
tbe long .Inly twilight had faded irn
perceptidly into moonlight, which
made tbe surface of tbe river and the
banks, except whore tbo shadows of
tbe trees fell black upon them,
almost as plainly visible aa in the
day-timo. ;
John slipped up to bis room, n
little cbambei under tbe eaves ot the
house. He had hung tbo bathing
breeches out of the window to dry,
after be had taken them oft' earlier in
tbe day. They were dry now, and he
put them on again, and put bia
trousers and coat on ovor them,
buttoning his coat up to his throat.
The ferry waa bringing a team
across in tho big boat. John could
hear tbe men talking, their voices
coming in distinctly over tbo water.
Tbe man in the wagon was a neighbor,
and tbe ferryman was telling him
about the accident on tbe river that
afternoon. The bny waited until the
boat bad reapbed tbe bank and the
man had driven off up tbe road.
When the house was quiet he took
bis bag of iron, with tho string and
shingle tied to it, and slipping out
the back door went down to the river.
Stepping into one of the rowboats ho
pushed otf, and rowed out into tho
stream. •■':•»
Once in tbe middle ot the river tbe
young man rowod back and foith,
and up aud down, for several minutes,
until he was satisfied that he. was
very near the place where the large
boat bad been when tbe horse bad
backed tho wagon overboard.
Then, taking tbe bag from the boat,
be dropped it into tho river.
The bag sank out of sight instantly.
The shingle swirled in tho water tor
a moment, and then slowly floated
down stream.
Tho boy let the boat drift, oheoking
it with the oars if it went too fast.
The shingle buoy floated down slow
ly, more slowly than the current,
held back as it was by the drag at the
bottom of the river.
In the bright moonlight tho shingle
showed distinctly on the water. It
did not go into the eddy at all. Just
before it was abroast of this place tho
buoy swerved diagonally toward the
opposite side of the river, and then
waa dragged down stream again.
Evidently the currents at tha bottom
ot thu river ilowed differently from
those at tbe surface.
John turned tbe boat's head up
Btrenin and rowed home. Uefore he
wont to bed he looked into an
almanac and found that sunrise the
next morning would be at quarter
before 5 o'clock, and theu placed an
alarm clock eet to go otf half an hour
before besido tbe bead of his bed.
Wbon tbe clock woke him in the
morning, and he dressed and went
dowu to the boats, tbe whole Con
uectiout valley was a. mass of fog.
The water looked black, in contrast
with tbo white wreaths of mist rising
from it.
A tew strokes of tbe oars sent the
boat out into the chanuel aud down
past the eddy to tbe place where he
had seen the last of the shingle the
night betote. From there ho let the
boat drift, scauning tbe water close
ly on both sides of bis buoy. Drift
ing in this way, turning from side to
side, and now aud then rowing out
of tbe channel to explore some cove
over which the brunobos of tbe trees
which grew ou tbe bunk bung, John
Wright went down the river nearly a
mile before be found what he was
looking fir. The shingle was floating
lazily in an eddy where the ourreut,
after sweeping around a sharp bend
iv tbe liver, sheered off to a high,
lie rowed the boat into the eddy,
aud getting hold of the shiugle pull
ed on tbe string, carefully at first, so
as to liiul out just wbero hiu dummy
bug lay. Then, that this might be
out ot the way, he pulled the water
soaked bag of scrap-iron up, aud put
it in tho boat.
It seemed juut a little bit lonesome,
diving dowu through all those feet of
dark water, aloue there, with all tho
r-'Ht nf the world except a oirole of n
fiuv rods nrounrl him blotted out In
fop. .lust, tlieu there came Ilmniuli

Gold Found By Chance.
The'roceut sensational diaoovory of
a rloh gold Held through tbe accident
of digging a grave in an old ceme
tery near ballarat adda another
chapter to tbe romance of mining
which never loses Us freahnoss and
allurement. Marshall's find ot gold
in tbe tail race of Suiter's mill is an
often told story.
Among tbe tens of thousands of
gold-sookera whom Marshall's dis
covery lured to California were two
miners Martin and Flower, of whom
the following story is told: Foi
months these two men had prospect
ed for gold without seeing a , single
trace of tbe preoious metal, until,
worn out by terrible hardships and
fatigue, Flower succumbed. To bury
hia fallen comrade was a pious duty
wbicb Martin, although himself re
duced to tbe last extremity ot weak
ness, could not omit; so he proceed
ed to dig his grave at the foot of an
adjacent tree, lln had not proceeded
far in bia task when bis pick struck
something hard, which proved to be
aa enormous nugget, weighing nearly
15) pounds, which he sold for $36,270.
1 it was an equally trivial accident
wbicb opened to tbe world tbe rich
I'ilbara Held in West Australia. A
boy iv au idle moment picked up a
stone unaccountably heavy for its
size, tbe lad, instead ot throwing it
at tbo bird, examined it closely aud
found that it was full of glittering
yellow specks, which, even to his un
trained eye, suggested gold. He put
it into tbe bands of an expert, who
pronounced it to be a particularly
rich specimen of gold-bearing quartz.
Just fifteen years ago two miners
Messrs Ford and Hayley, started from
Southern Cross on what seemed to be
a hopeless quest of gold in tbe barren
Australian busbland. Weeks and
months of weary wandering passed,
and still tbe ; precious metal seemed
more distant and elusive than ever,
until in despair they turned their
horses' beads toward I'ertb, deter
mined to return home.
Oue dark night Hayley wan aroused
by tbe restlessness of his horse, which
was pioketed outside his tent, and,
going out to see what was tbe matter,
he tripped in tbe darkness over a
boulder, which, on examination,
proved to be almost entirely gold.
Tbe next day a claim was pegged out;
within a month tbe prospectors had
unearthed 350,000 worth of gold; and
on tbe Bite of this lucky stumble
there sprang up the world famous
town ot Coolgardie.
Fivo years later tbe frozen wastes
of Alaska were tbe xcene of an equal
ly romantic accident. Ono day
George Carnack, a trapper was idly
stirring tbe ashes of hia dead camp
fire when be noticed a strange yellow
oolor which he could not account for.
Chancing to mention the fact at a bar
in the neighboring Forty Creek, sus
picion' was aroused, au inspection
was made, and tbe oolor which bad
puzzled tbe half-breed trapper was
declared to be gold. Within au hour
ecorea of meu were, digging hard in
the neighborhood of tbe tire and each
spadeful brought up gold.

.Like worlds, animals and plnnts,
some elements nl, lonst, as we have
Inlnlr coino to know, are bom, Jlvo
and din. We know little of their
Hfe-porlods, but A. X. Cameron
points out that tho nativity of radium
emanntiou falls to one-halt in four
days, to one-oighth in eight days, and
so on, but will not completely dis
appear in an inlliiitu time. The half
life period of a radio-active sub
stance, or period when halt a Riven
quantity disappears, can be deter
mined, the time varying from lour
seconds in the ouse of actinium
emanntiou to millions) of years in the
case of uranium. Sir William Ram
say states thiit infinity in this con
nection may menn simply a longer
time than we can measure, and tbat
it Is very probablo that the atoms of
radium and other elements may have
a definite and mensurable life-period.
Experiments indlonte tbat the radium
atom baa a very regular decay, being
little intluenced by external condi
tions. In a given mass some atoms
are being born, some may be thou
sands ot years old and some may be
dying, and from the rate of disappear
ance we are justified in assuming an
averuge life of a radio-aotive atom,
and tbat average will probably be the
actual life of an atom of that ele
ment.
The Uannert gas, the new German
illuminnnt for small towns, is made
trom oil and coke, and is muoh
cheaper than water gas, which it
somewhat resembles. The coke used
in its production is less than a third
of tbat consumed for a like amount
ot coal gas. The new gas yields a
bright flame, and as there are no by
products, the process of manufacture
is simple.
In the process of Leon Dion, partial
decomposition of water by a weak
electric current yields oxygen and
ozone that purify the water for drink

Glass mirrors for the searchlights
of battleships are liable to break nnd

stitute metal for the glass seem to
have been unsatisfactory until the

Uowper-Coles, the British metal
lurgist, overcome the difficulty of
making true parabolic mirrois ot
metal, liy this method a thin reflect
ing film of silver is first deposited on
v convex glass mold, then copper is
deposited on the back until this Is
sufficiently strengthened. Such mir
rors have came into extensive use,
but nn improved type, in which altoi

be given the texture of the fluent

A DOLEFUL DILEMMA
The Tearful Tale of the Per
plexed Princess.
HER UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM.
A Most Puzzling end Lamentable Sit
uation That Fortunnloly For the
Poaco of Mind of Womankind I* Not
at All Liablo to Recur.
Now, when It wns tho thousand and
third night, said Dunynzrul to her sis
ter, Bbflhrassfldi "Allah upon me, O my
Sister, recite to us some new story, de
lightsome nnd delectable, wherewith to
v!ille away tho waking hours of our
lnttor night."
"With joy nnd goodly will," answer*
<d Shahraznd, "If this pious and nuspl
cloua king permit."
"Tell on," quoth the king, who had
frooly partaken of the dish termed by
the Franks "the rabbit of Wales" nnd
Avns sleepless and restless. So Shnhrn
eatl, rejoiced with the prospect of talk
ing, thus began on the thousand and
third night "The Tale of tho Perplexed
Princess:"
Afar In the realm of Gurlcund, which
lies within the hind of Hindustan, once
reigned a mighty king who had ono
daughter of such exceeding beauty
Iliat all who beheld her became poets
nnd warriors, which was well for tho
national fame, but ill for the royal
treasury.
Now, the loveliness of the princess
being such, it may seem strange that
she had attained her eighteenth year
unmarried, yet so It befell, for in his
hesitancy because eff the groat multi
tude of eligible suitors the king-, who,
though otherwise respectable, was a
vilely devout heathen, made a vow
that he would give his daughter hi
marriage only to that man who should
receive the indorsement of his Idol, on
image of exceeding ugliness housed In
n golden temple adjacent to the palace.
So It was thot- ninny princes from
many lands enrae to bow before the
idol, offering splendid sacrifices and
rich gifts of treasure for the desired
sign of favor, yet ever the idol re
mained silent.
At length there came from the Is
land of Lanka a prince of great power,
and so deeply smitten was he with love
for the princess that he bowed before
the Idol, saying. "Great lord, grant
but that the princess may become my
bride, and then shall I without delay
return to thee and cut off -my own
head ns a thank offering!"
And the next day when the king and
all his court came to worship In the
golden temple the evil spirit that was
within the Idol caused the hand of the
Image to stretch forth and point to the
prince nnd caused the stone lips to
open and say to the king, "Behold thy
son-in-law!"
Forthwith was the wedding of the
prince and princess celebrated with
great pomp In tho palace, and straight
way thereafter. In fulfillment of his
vow, the prince hastened to the tem
ple, bowed before the Idol and cut off
his own bend.
Then entered the priest of the tem
ple and In his Brief, horror and fear
for what had chanced and for what
might well come to him in conse
quence likewise cut off his head. ■
Then entered the princess, seeking
her husband, and, seeing but the two
headless bodies, raised the prince's
sword and was about to sever her own
lovely head when the Idol spoke again,
Baying: "Hold! Take tho bends and
eet them upon the men's shoulders!"
And the princess did even so. And
the heads grew fast to the bodies, and
the bodies rose upon their feet.
But now it appeared that in her
haste and tumult of mind the princess
had set the priest's head upon the
shoulders of the prince nnd the
prince's head upon the shoulders of
the priest, so that in a way each was
the other, yet neither was either, and
each claimed her as his bride, and
each head, being a wise head, spake
many shrewd arguments one way and
the other, yet could neither prevail.
And so wns tho princess sore perplex
ed, und. in truth, never have I learned
how logically to conclude the tale.
"In sooth." said the klnp. "'might she
not have ohtulned a divorce?"
"Nay, sire." replied Shahrazad, "for
from whom? And which must she
then have married In accordance with
the word of the, ldol?"
"Then," proposed the king, "why
might they not have matched dinars to
decide which should have her?"
"Ah. my lord." said Shahrazad, shak
ing her head, "that would have been in
nccord with tho easy, unscientific
method of the far west, which would
still have left the problem unsolved."
"Surely, then," urged the king, "they
might have fought for her."
"And would thnt have determined
the truth?" rwpoudml Shahrazad. "and
would not the victor have been either
or both a murderer nnd a suicide?
Alas, my lord, the insoluble perplexity
of this fair princess hath caused me
much sorrow, and glad am 1 only that
such sad dilemmas do not often occur."

LOCAL EDITORIAL COLUMN.
To the subscribers of the Ledger 111 the northern part of
the county, who for the past two weeks have not been receiv
ing this paper as early as they formerly" did, a few words of
explanation is due. Before the advent: of the I. and H. rail
road between lone and Jackson, the mineral belt from Jack
son clear through to Plymouth was blessed with a direct,
prompt and efficient daily mail service, A letter- posted in
Jackson in the morning in time for this stage would reach the
northern end of the route in about three hours, enabling an
answer to be returned the sender the same day. The county
seat paper in those days reached all the northern towns on
Saturday morning. The residents all along the route were
perfectly satisfied with the mail facilities then afforded. The
extension of railroad facilities is usually attended with im
provemeut in the mail carrying business; certainly it should
not cause a deterioration in auy part of the service. But this
has actually been the case with regard at least to that portion
of the mineral belt north of Amador City. The through
mail route from Jackson to Plymouth was dropped, and in
lieu thereof a route from Jackson to Amador City, via Mar
tell, was' instituted. As far as Sutter Creek and Amador
City are concerned, and their communicition with the county
seat, the arrangement is tolerably satisfactory, although, less
so than the old-time service. Drytown and Plymouth, how
ever, were hit hard by this new-fangled deal. To' illustrate
itsabsurdity we may state that Drytown is less than three
miles distant from Amador City by the main county road.
A letter mailed in Amador and addressed to a party in Dry
town, traveling by the established mail routes, goes first to
Martells by stage, 5 miles; thence by I. and E. railroad to
lone, I 4 miles; thence by Amador branch railroad to Gait, 27
miles; thence back over the Amador branch railroad to Car
bondale, 20 miles: thence by stage to Central House, 10
miles; thence by stage to Drytown, 1 mile. Total distance
traveled 78 miles; time, 12 hours. An equally roundabout
route is taken by matter mailed from Jackson or SutterCreek
bound for the northern towns. And the same of course
applies to newspaper, or second-class mail matter. But
Steiner's stage line, without a mail -contract, has continued
right along to make daily trips to and fro between Jackson
and Plymouth on the old time schedule adapted for passenger
travel. The post-office department failed to renew a mail
contract over this route on the ground that the price asked
was too high. On the other hand the stage owner explains
that the change of time required to meet the railroad time
at Martells would have been fatal to the passenger traffic
over the stage line, and hence the increased price asked for
carrying the mail. The residents of northern Amador have
been greatly inconvenienced by this failure to secure a direct
service with the county seat. Methods were resorted to by
friendly arrangements with the stage line to tone down the
inconvenience as much as possible. One of these concerned
the delivery of the county seat papers to the towns along the
mining belt early Saturday morning. By the circuitous mail
route the papers could not reach Dry town and Plymouth un
til night, after most of the farmers from the outlying country
had called for their mail and gone home. ' But by the kind
ness of the stage driver the county seat papers were left at
the various postoffices along the route in ample time to reach
the subscribers the same day. It was an accommodation
much appreciated by both publishers and subscribers. And
it worked no hardship upon any one. Newspapers, under
second-class rating, are sent through the mails free of charge
to any poiut within the county wherein they are published.
So there was no loss of postage by the government in sending
the papers by the stage line; on the contrary, the postal de
partment was thereby relieved of some gratuitous transporta
tion.
But the arrangement has recently been tabooed by orders
from the postal department, instructing postmasters not to
accept the newspaper bundles except through the regular
mail channels. However arbitrary and uncalled for this ac
tion may seem, all concerned have to submit, and take steps
to secure a better postal service.
As a result the Ledger is put to press earlier Friday after
noon than heretofore so as to catch the mail for Sutter Creek
and Amador City, which closes at half-past three o'clock.
For Drytown and Plymouth the papers for time being have
to take tbe long-distance route herein set forth, with all its
needless inconvenience, until the restrictive order can be
repealed, or a more satisfactory mail route can be established.
It seems to us there should be little difficulty in re-establish
ing the through mail stage route if the facts were fully and
squarely laid before the authorities.
The board of supervisors at their meeting this week passed
an order directing the clerk to notify all county officials to
get stationery required in printing letterheads and enveloyes
from the stationery firm having the contract for the same —
Vela & Piccardo. This .is designed to stop the grafting
practices shown up by the Ledger last week eveu under the
newly-established priuting schedule. We shall watch how
it works. It seems us the more effectual plan would be to re
fuae paymeut for such illegal items.

The Story of a Medicine.
Its namo— "Goldon Mod leal Discovery"
was sugßcstod by ono of Its most Import-
ant, and valuable Ingredients — Golden
Seal root.
Nearly forty years ago, Dr. Pierce dls«
covered that ho could, by tho uso of puro,
trlplo-mflned glycerlno, aided by a cer-
tain degroo of constantly maintained
heat and with tho aid of apparatus and
appliances designed for that purpose, ex-
tract from our mostvaluablo native mo-
dlcinal roots their curative properties
much better than by tho use of alcohol,
so gonerally employed. So tlio now world-
famed "(lolden Medical Discovery," for
the euro of weak stomach, indlgostlon. or
dyspepsia, torpid liver, or biliousness and
kindred derangements was first made, as
it ever slnie has b\en, without a particle
of alcohol In Its maKc-up. .
A glanceVaJMtojuYl list of Its Ingredi-
ents, printed^ oh^Cverv bottle-wrapper,
will show that It Is niacU) from the most'

ATlittlebooKof these endorsements nas
been compiled by Dr. R. V. Pierce, of
Buffalo, N. V., and will bo mailed free to
any one asking same by postal card, or
letter addressed to the Doctor as above.
From- these endorsements, copied from
standard medical books of all tho differ-
on t schools of practice, It will bo found
that the ingredients composing tho "Gold-
en Medical Discovery" aro advised not
only for the euro of tho abovo mentioned
diseases, but also for the euro of all ca-
tarrhal, bronchial- and throat affections,
accompained with, catarrhal discharges,
hoarseness, sore . throat, lingering, or
hang-on-coughs, and all thoso wasting
affections which, If not promptly and
properly treated aro liable to terminate
in consumption. Take Dr. Pierces Dis-
covery in time and persevere in Its uso
until you give it a fair trial and it Is not
likely to disappoint. Too much must not
be expected of It. It will not perform
miracles. It will not cure consumption
in Its advanced stages. No medicino will.
It will cure the affections that lead up to
consumption, If taken in time.

AN AUDACIOUS PLAN.
H«w Captain Haraden Bluffed th«
Dri>;isher Into Surrender.
A fight Is n fight for 'n tlmt, anil
just ns nn example of early American
'•norve" n hldi'.v unearthed liy Itnliili
)). Pulne In the old Beit logs nt Ksnok
institute, in Bale til, Is of much inteftiJtt
It Is told liy Mr. I'nlne us follows In
Outing Alngnzlne: ' 'i. ■ '■■•
Tlio king's packet was a fo«? to tost
Cnptnln Ifiirndon's mrttlivniid he
found he hml n tough niHiifconist. Tuny
fought four full honrn; •■ "or four
glasses." as flic log records It. after
which Captain Ilnrmlon found tlint ho
must haul out of tlio notion nnd repair
damages to rigging nnd hull. Ho (!!«•
covered nlso that he had used nil the
powdor on hoard except one charge.
It would have hoen n credltnlile con
clusion of the matter If he had. called
the action n drawn hattle and gone- on
his way. ,
It vrna In his mind, however, to try
nn Immensely audacious plan which
could succeed only hy means of 'the
most cold blooded courage on his part.
Hamming home his last charge of pow
der nnd double shotting the gun. lie
ranged alongside his plucky enemy,
who wns terribly cut up. but still un
conquered, nnd hailed her:
"I will give you five minutes' to haul
down, your colors. If they are not
down nt the end of that time. I will
fire Into and sink you, so help me
God!"
It was n test of mind, not of metal.
The British commander wns n brave
man who had fought his ship like a
hero. But the sight of this infernally
Indomitable figure on the quarter deck
of the shot rent Pickering, the thought
of being exposed to another broadside
at pistol range, the aspect of tlio blood
stained, half naked privatoersmen
grouped at their guns with matches
lighted, was too much for him. Cap
tain Haraden stood, watch in hand,
calling off the minutes so that his voice
could be heard aboard the packet:
"Three."
But he had not said "Four" when
the British colors fluttered down from
the yard, and the packet ship wns his.
WONDERS OF WATER.
Extent to Which Fluid Mingles With
Bodice Apparently Solid.
The extent to which water mingles
with bodies apparently solid is won
derful. The glittering opal which
beauty wears as an ornament Is only
flint and water. In every plaster of
paris statue which an Italian carries
through our streets for sale there Is
one pound of water to every four
pounds of chalk. The air we breathe
contains five grains, of water to each
cubic foot of Its bulk. The potatoes
and turnips whiqh are boiled for our
dinner have in their raw state the one
75 per cent and the other 90 per cent
of water.
If a man weighing ten stone were
squeezed flat in a hydraulic press
seven and one-half stone of water
would run out and only two and one
half stone of dry residue remain. A
man is. chemically speaking, forty-five
pounds of cqrbon and nitrogen diffused
through five and a half, pallfuls of
water. In plants we find water thus
mingling in no 'less wonderful a man
ner.
A sunflower evaporates one and a
quarter pints of water a day and a
cabbage about the same quantity. A
wheat plant exhales in 172 days about
100,000 grains of water. An acre of
growing wheat, on this calculation,
draws and passes out about ten tons
of water per day.
The sap of plants Is the medium
through which this mass of fluid is
conveyed. It forms a delicate pump
by, which the watery particles run
with the rapidity of a swift stream.
By the action of the sap various prop
erties may be communicated to tbe
growing plant. Timber lv France is,
for instance, dyed by various colors
being mixed with water and poured
over the root of the tree. Dahlias are
also colored by a {similar process.—Lon
don Tit-Bits.
Making It Clear.
A very young child was saying his
prayers at the bedside In his grand
father's house. The grandfather, aux
tous to hear the boy. stood at the room
door, which was sufficiently open for
him to see and hear the child. After
the usual asking God to bless his par
ents the child reached "God bless
grandma and grandpa." At the men
tion of the last named, tbe boy's eye
catching sight of bis grandfather, be
stopped and, pointing his little finger,
said. "There bo is!"-Philadelphia In
quirer.
An Easy Job.
A schoolmaster set as an essay sub
ject to a class of bis young hopefuls
"What I would like to be," and one
pronouncement, delivered in a bold
half text, was as follows: "I would like
to be a horse driver. When you are
driving 11 horse you sit and do nothing.
You do that all day and feed tbe horse
at night and your work is done for
that day. Then when Saturday comes
you get your pay. and then you get all
Sunday to yourself." — Kansas City
Newsbook.
A Long Wait.
"Did you and your wife take n long
trip on your honeymoon?"
"It seemed long to me. Her fntber
had promised to settle a snug sum of
money on us as soon as we got back."
