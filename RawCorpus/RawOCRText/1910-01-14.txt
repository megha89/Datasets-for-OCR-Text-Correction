True Story of This Great
Tragedy
In the fall of 1855 a young Mexican,
not more than I(i years of age, ap
pioached Joe Gilbert of Drytown and
said. "1 am the friend of the Americans
and I have something to tell you of vital
importance to you and your, countrymen.
All I ask is your sacred promise as a
friend, as 1 know you are, to keep my
secret. If my name is known in this
connection in any manner with this
matter my life would pay the forfeit."
Gilbert, who talked the Spanish
language very well, assured the boy that
his name should not be used and be
faithfully protected.
Then, "said the boy." prepare to
protect yourself and your people, for I
overheard some Mexcans talking last
night, and to-morrow night they intend
to murder and rob the people of this
town."
With an assurance to the boy not to
use his name in any manner in divulg
ing of the secret of murdering and sack*
ing of the town, which would certainly
leave much blood in its trail,
with an adio left the faithful young
Mexican to go and confer with his
fellow townsmen. Among the most
prominent of them was a man by the
name of Bell — a half blood Cherokee —
who then was the proprietor of the hotel
now owned and run by Florence Gian
nini. Gilbert knew Bell to be a fearless
man— a gun-fighter as we now denomi
nate them — ready to face any crisis in
any wav or any manner. Bell had more
than once tracked Mexican cut-throats
to their lair and brough them up to face
the law. They were afraid of him.
Bell listened to the recital of Gilbert
telling of the contemplated racking,
murdering and robbing of the people of
Drytown. The ' keen, piercing hawk
eyes of the Cherokee flashed fire at
Gilbert's recital.
"Intend to murder and rob the people
of this place, do -they? If they do
there will be many a dead Mexican to
tell the tale, for I'll crack more than one
Mexican's skull, with my revolver, and
there is more than one man here besides
me that will do the same 1 ."
As he finished he whirled on his heel,
followed by Gilbert. The two sought
hastily the men they knew could befaith.
fully relied on for pluck and determina
tion, and the town was soon armed to
♦he teeth for the coming combat.
At that time the . street leading at
right angles from the main'street stretch
ing out toward Jackson, and heading
toward where Plymouth now stands, was
almost solidly blocked with Mexican
houses. Among the most prominent
therein was a dance house thronged by-
Mexican senoritas— the very hell hole
of the place in general. It was 8
o'clock and the pale moon in its first
quarter was dropping stolidly behind the
dense fringes of the trees on the hill in
the west. Twenty well armed men had
gathered at the dance house, for it was
here the faithful young Mexican had
told Gilbert they would be first seen. A
few took a drink at the bar to ward off
suspicion that their appearance was any
thing else than social. As they sat
waiting on the long benches on the out
side with keen expectancy, shadows
played in effigy before their bewildered
senses. Each shadow seemed to rise in
phantasm in mockery of murder, but
still no Mexicans came. Suddenly the
clatter of horses' hoofs struck audibly
upon the ear. Nearer and clearer came
the tread of the horses. As the horse
man approached the iingling of the great
spurs of which all Mexicans took pride,
told that the horsemen were only a few
yards away. Instinctively each man
drew his hand close to his revolver that
hung in the holster at his side. A
moment more and 18 well armed Mexi
cans, with their bread sombreros hiding
their swarthy faces from the glinting
moonligh.t halted before the door. Not
a word was spoken by either party, but
the keen treacherous eyes of the
murderous throng took in the situation.
Instantly almost the leader of the gang
gave the reins on his horse a twich,
sank the rowels of his spurs into his
flanks and rode off toward the great
white Catholic church that stood on the
hillside a little east or south of this
place, and ' on a direct line of Lower
Rancheria. In' 1 unison each horseman
followed his leader—a renegade white
man by the name of Porter. A stalwart
negro, black as ebony, rode by his side.
The others, low-browed treacherous
looking Mexicans, characteristic, of the
peonage type of mendicants that 'are
so prevalent in old Mexico. In council
the Americans concluded they were only
making away in order to attack- the
place from a different standpoint. They
watched the murderous band of horsemen
until darkness swallowed them up in its
Intensity. The Americans walked brisk
ly now to the main street of the town.
They had barely arrived there when
bang! bang! bang! came the report of
the revolver.
"They are murdering the people of
Rancheria shouted a dozen voices ex
citedly, "Let us go to their rescue"
"No," said Bell, "for their bloody
deed will be over before we can reach
them, besides they might wheel round If
we kave this place unprotected and
murder our own women and children."
In one sense Bell was right, for a few
minutes only had left devastation and
much blood in the little hamlet of
Rancheria.
Old man Dynan, father of John Dynan
now of Amadnr City, was shot through
the fleshy part of the arm. He was a
quick-witted man, and seeing he had
but one chance for his life, fell back
ward behind the warming stove. As he
did so he threw his arm across his
breast. The blood spurted out from the
pistol shot and saturated his entiro
bosom with blood. Porter approached
him, held for an instant - his cocked
pistol uponhis breast, and said, "There
is no use to waste another shot on him,
for he is deader than hell." All this
time, Dvnan lay without a quiver or a
motion of any kind. His nerve had
thwarted the murderers and saved his
life.- His wife, who attempted to es
cape by flight, was shot dead as she
sprang through the window and fell a
lifeless corpse on the outside. Her
ltttle tot of a girl, 2or 3 years old was
thrown bodily through the window,
breaking the sash and falling in a heap
just beyond the sill.. She had no bones
broken, and she is now the wife of
Charlie Enns, now of Fresno, who is
well known to old residents of Amador
City. A half dozen men lay weltering
in their own gore— among them was
Dvnan 's partner, who was shot dead as
he raised up behind the bar with a
pistol in hand to defend himself. Morse
Taylor, hemmed in, fled upstairs pur
sued by a. Mexican who fired half a
dozen shot at him. He jumped out of a
window twenty feet from the ground and
was pursued by Mexicans on the out
side. He Hed up the old road leading to
Amador, and which now is known as
Culberfs grade. Shot after shot ploughed
the dirt around him. In his flight he>
passed an Indian coming to the town.
In the darkness they took the Indian for
Taylor. The Mexican levelled his
pistol and shot the Indian dead. Taylor
escaped, but the shot that killed the In
dian brought destruction to many a
Mexican.
A few days later the Indians were in
vited to help hunt the murderers down.
But Indian-like they made no fins dis
tinction between Mexicans. They were
supposed to arrest and bring them in for
the law to deal with. If they told a
Mexican to halt, it only gave "Mr ln
gun" a better shot at him, if he didn't
they shot him on the "wing."
It was no ' uncommon occurrence the
following season to find the bones of
supposed Mexicans whitening under the
rays of noonday's sun. The vengence of
the Indian had overtaken no doubt many
an innocent Mexican that had nothing
whatever to do with the massacre.
After the murderers had completed
their slaughter they built a fire .in the
center of the street with dry good box
for fuel. The lurid glare of the Sanies
shot its light across the street and upon
the ghastly scenes of carnage and blood
within. A half hour only elapsed when
all their crime was completed. The
murderous band then mounted their
horses and rode off into the deep shadow
of the night. CHAS S. BELL.

Inquiries from Amador
County.
Inquiries are frequently received for
information regarding the possibilities
of this county for various branches of
industry. One was addressed to the
chamber of commerce this week, asking
for information about dairying, and for
any literature bearing on the subject.
There are certainly fine opening in this
line, where all the conditions required
by the inquirer are met. Unfortunately,
we have no literature on that or any
other subject pertinent to homeseekers
to send. We are slow to get a move on
ourselves, and cannot expect outsiders
to ' move our way under the circum
stances. We seem to be indifferent
about Inviting them to come.

CENSUS MATTERS
The supervior of census of the sixth
district of California, which Includes*
Amador county, is gathering Informa
tion relative to the county. He says
the last census gave to township No 1,
a population of 3550, Township 2, 1772,
Township 3, 1694, Township 4, 2047,
Township 5, 1453, He says in deter
mining upon the number of enumera
tors, it is desirable to have some idea
as to the present population.
In a city one enumerator will be able
to take from twenty-five hundred to
thirty-five hundred names in the month
to which the taking of the ceusus is
limited. In country districts where
farm statistics are also taken, the enu
merator prohably will not be able to
handle more than one half that many,
nanies. " |
In the division of the county he has
given Jackson one enumerator, and to
the remainder of the township one enu
merator, and to each of the other town
ships except Sutter Creek, one enumer
ator and to Sutter Creek township (4)
he has given two enumerators. What
he would particularly like to know is
where would be a good dividing line
that would cut Sutter Creek township
in divisions about equal as to the
amount of work required.
The dividing line should be so clearly
defined as to avoid so for as possible
the danger of enumerators trenching on
each others territory. A county road, a
creek or river, a flume or ditch line, or
some natural boundary of that kind is
preferable, although of course it is not
always practicable to be obtain such
clearly define lines.
Census supervisors are having diffi
culty on account of the failure of ap
plications for positions as enumerators
that is, those who will do the actual
work of taking the census. Applicants
are required to pass an examination,
which is not a serious matter, as any
one with an ordinary common school
education can easily get through.
Applications must be Hied with the
supervisor of the district on or before
the 25th instant, and the examination
will be held at Modesto, for this dis
trict, on the sth of February. Up to a
few days ago only 25 applications had
been filed in this district, and fully 30
more will be required for the work.'
The census taking must be done in one
month, and the compensation is $60 for
each. No doubt this latter fact is the
reason of the slowness of workers ito
come forward. The pay is not a
sufficient inducement in California,
whatever it may be in other states.

A Valuable Invention
Angelo Marcucci and Virgilio Belluo
mini received a U. S. patent for an im
provement in a monkey wrench last
Saturday. One would think that the
end has been long ago reached for any
device on tools of that class. Every one
knows that to adjust a common wrench
to a nut of any size it is necessary to
turn a screw thread to slide the movable
jaw to the required distance, requiring
a little time and some patience. In the
device patented a small upright pin is
placed in the handle and with the pres
sure from the thumb releases a bar
notched like a saw. That gives the user
a chance to adjust the jaws to the nut,
and when the pin is released, the
notched block engages with a similar
one effectually locking it until a change
is desired. While it apDcars to be and
is a simple mechanical movement, it
has taken both young men six years to
bring it to its present state of per
fection. There was no interference in
the patent oHice ; the application had a
clear Held and the patent was granted in
about one month after the application
had been made. A. Marcucci went to
the city Monday in the interest of the
new wrench. He is to have some made
for exhibition purposes and it is their
intention to immediately place it on the
market and have it manufactured in the
east.
Saved At Death's Door
The door of death seemed ready to
open for Murray W. Avers, of Transit
Bridge N. V., when his life was won
derfully saved. "1 was in v dreadful
condition," he writes, "my skin was
almost yellow ; eyes sunken : tongue
coated; emaciated from losing 40
pounds, growing weaker daily. Viru
lent liver trouble pulling me down to
death in spite of doctors. Then that
matchless medicine-electric bitters
cured me. 1 regained the 40 pounds
lost and now am well and strong."
For all stomach, liver and kidney
troubles they're supreme. 50c at Spag

MINING NOTES
Bunker Hill.— The north drift at the
1750 level has encountered a strong How
of water, which is considered an in
dication of the proximity of the main
ore body. Bodies of ore have been
struck on this drirt, but not the main
ledge, which is calculated from the
workings above to be some distance
further north. As soon as the main
ledge is reached, work will be com
menced in drifting for the ore body at
the 1950 level.
South Eureka.— The clean-up at this
mine for last month was over $42,000,
averaging about $1150 per stamp. This
is not up to the record of the i preceding
month, but is still a very flattering
showing. The stock is said to be held
at over $4 per share.
Argonaut.— Cutting a station at the
3300 foot level was started early this
week. The mine is moving along very
prosperously, and the monthly output of
the mill continues to be more than equal
to the payment of the regular dividend
of 5 cents ocr share, which calls for a
distribution of $10,000 per month to the
stockholders.
Miscellaneous.— ln running a pros
pecting tunnel on the old Wiley ranch,
near Aqueduct, a quartz ledge said to
be nine feet wide has been struck, the
ore being of good milling quality. John
Strohm and others have been furnishing
the funds for the prospecting operations,
which have been going on for a long
time, the tunnel having reached several
hundred feet in length. Indications are
bright for developing a paying mine on
this property.  ,

City Politics.
Candidates for city officers begin to
be talked of, although the election is
three months ahead. ' Inquiries are be
ing made as to the method of candidates
securing a place on the ticket, as there
is an impression that the direct primary
law changes the situation materially.
For the information of those concerned,
we will state that unless, party action is
taken to nominate candidates— which is
unlikely— the primary law does not
affect the situation at all. If an aspir
ants wants to run as a republican or
democrat, he must circulate a petition,
signed by three per cent of the party
voters, to have his name placed on the
primary ticket.
This, petition must be filed at least
fourteen days before the primary elec
tion, and the primary must be held on
Tuesday at least three weeks preceding
the regular city election. Independent
nominations may be made as heretofore,
by petition of three per cent of the
electors, filed not less than 15 days prior
to the election. Candidates for marshal
and clerk are already cropping up, but
there is no anxiety manifested l for the*
berths of city trustees.

PINCHOT'S DISMISSAL.
President Taft has summarily dismissed Gifford Piuchot,
chief of the U. S. forestry service. This action has stirred
up a lot of controversy, as no man iv the public service
has commanded more attention than Piuchot, because of his
advocacy of the conservatiou policy in regard to natural re
sources of wealth in forests and water power sites. Piuchot
was 1 ea*lly the originator, of the conservation policy inaug
urated by the Roosevelt administration, and, in this work he
has accomplished an imestimable service for the benfit of the
country. As the father of this great reform he will ever
occupy a prominent place in histor3'. It is to be regretted
that circumstances of his own making rendered his dismissal
imperative. He wrote a letter to senator Dolliver criticising
the administration for not taking his extreme views on some
questions, and this letter was made public iv congress. Of
coarse there remained but one course open to the president,
namely to dischargg the indiscreet official for insubordination
PiriOaoi: is evidently afxlicted" with swell-head". 1 Me has been
lauded and pampered to such an extent that he had conceived
an overwhelming idea of his own importance. He was a
"bigger man than Taft" in his own estimation, and doubtless
imagined he could criticise his superiors, and carry the ver
dict of the people with him. We take no stock in ' the ex
planation that Pinchot realized that he was inviting his own
discharge. On the contrary, he imagined he was intrench
ing himself in public opinion by his mutinous letter, and
that he could thereby promote the adoption of his extreme
views. His address to his subordinates in the service upon
his retirement partakes of the .same spirit of insubordination,
in telling them that the claims of the people were higher and
more sacred than the clafms of the administration — a truism
of course, but inopportune, and another covert slap at the
"higher-ups," and an incentive to rebellion. Without de
tracting from the important service rendered by Pinchot, we
believe the cause of conservation will not suffer by his re
tirement. A radical reform cannot be effected at one step.
It must be brought about slowly, step by step, as the people
'become educated in the matter, and so avoid any" violent
interference with vested interests.
A THRIVING BUSINESS.
The amount paid out for bluejay bounty this month was
$100 — a jump of one-third over the sum drawn from the
treasur on that score last :zionth. Truly, the supervisors
have managed to develop a lively business in bluejay
destruction in the space of two mouths. Scalp bounty on
other predatory pests, so-called, footed up $100, making $200
as the toll upon Amador taxpayers iv one mouth. This is
only a starter. The demands will no doubt climb apace,
until the county managers will be compelled to wipe the
bounty from ordinance book. There is no valid excuse for a
county bounty law anyway. The abuses that grow up iv the
wake of such laws is more than an offset to any real good they
can accomplish. Beside which the housewife is just as
much entitled to protection from the ravages of rats and mice,
flies and so forth, as the farmers and stockmeu. Where is
the public treasury that could withstand the drain of a con
sistent policy on tills bounty proposition.
Mayor McCarthy is not creating a favorable impression for
a successful administration of the affairs of San Francisco.
On the eve of taking his seat he publicly declared that he
owed allegiance first and above all to the trades unions — a
most unpatriotic utterance from a private citizen, and in ex
ceedingly bad taste from a mayor elect. In taking office he
launched out into a bitter tirade of abuse of the outgoiug
administration — another evidence of unsound judgment.
Again, he has declared his unswerving opposition to the
bonds for the acquisition of the Spring Valley water system,
a going and paying business, at the same time working for
the impracticable Geary street car lino. All this does not
augur well for the new administration.

FITS OF PURE ANGER.
How to Know and Check This Dan-
gerous Tendonrcy.
There is many a young mother wlio
admires secretly the. little outbursts
of auger Unit baby gives vent to imd
thinks they are funny and cute until
by the time the child is two or three
years old she awakes to the sad real
ization that her baby has grown into n
willful and spoiled child who is thought
unytliing but fovable and cute by utl>
i;r people. She theu begins to see
what lack of discipline has done for
the baby. Every mother, out of jus
tice to the child as well as to h«';;elf.
should check these outbursts of singer
when the child first shows au inclina
tion to indulge in them. But when
the mother finds that the outbursts
have taliou a firm hold on the child
and seom to occur periodically she
should set about the tedious task of
overcoming them.
The little one should be punislioil.
but her will must not be broken by
repeated "spankings." for these seldom
fail to give the child a moody, sulky
disposition. It takes times and pa
tience to effect a cure. The best euro
for these fits of angor is to shut the
child In a room by itsolf whenever
they occur. A particularly successful
method of making a naughty ehiSd
good is to divert its attention from un
pleasant things. .Children often have j:s
much to make thorn irritable and cross
as a grown person, and when a moth
er notices that a child is fretful it
takes but a minute to find an unused
toy or a new book or to suggest a new
arid interesting occupation that will
brighten the child's mood and prevent
an outburst of auger before the child
r-an be aware of its. existence.
Hew to Maks a Lily Pond.
.Aquatic plants for the home garden
nre not grown as much as they should
be. Amateurs who hesitate for fear
of failure are wrong, for water lilies
'require far less care than tender bud
ding plants and nre less expensive.
Any swampy or boggy ground can
easily bo converted into ttn .aquatic
garden. Flowering shrubs, trees and
ferns will Krow luxuriantly uear a
pond. When you decide on the loca
tion of your pond, which should bo at
the lowest point of the garden, (11?
out tliu !-' ( )il from eighteen Inches to
throe feet deep, depending on Hie
severity of the winters in your local-
ity. The lilies must be planted deep
enough to prevent them froPKlng. An
Inexpensive way to m:»ke the pond
bold 'water is to line It with common
e'.ny. Cover Ihe bottom ami Bldea of
the pond with this clay thvo or four
inches thick and boat firmly t::>til solid
and even. The best method !■•» to plant
the water lilies in boxes or, tuba. Use
very rich soil, as coarse as possible.
Rough pieces Of sod and lumps of
earth should be mixed In. Boxes hold-
Ing five or fl* cubic feet will nceom
modate strong 'growing plants, and
others bolcUffg Ualf that much will ,b«
largo enough for the weaker srowlDS
plants. If t ho pond Is large the soil
[bay bo placed on t lx> bottom and tho
plants set out in it. but in smaller
nonda under this method, the roots of
the ttrenrer plants will quickly cover
the bottom, crowding out tho weaker.

An examination into the physical con

The examination was conducted by

radiographs of the prisoner's lungs were

suffering from a slight pharyngitis, or

A Pioneer
Of Five States
The man who lived to be 84 years old
is apt to hays some unusual adventures.
He is sure to. If he spends much of his
time on the outer edge of things. Such
n man is John A. Johnson of Everest.
He whs born a pioneer, having first
seen the light In Shelby county, Ken
tucky, February 10, 1825, at a time
when that state was wilder than it is to
day, although it has never acquired a re
putation for meekness and domestricity.
He moved with; his parents In 1827 to
Davies county, Kentucky, where he
grew to manhood. The early move may
have made an impression on the child
mind, or springing frUhi pioneer stock
may have been natural that he should
go and do likewise when yean turned
loose the wandering foot. At any rate,
he started when nineteen years old, and
didn't stop for good until he had seen
more of the world than most men do in
a .lifetime; more of the wild places
than one could find in these days of
spreading civilization. With the Rev.
George Pickel, a Baptist minister, he
went to Texus in 1843. Near Dallas,
which then contained but one house, the
wandering feet tarried to try farming for
two years. But before him always lay
the long trail, and in 1815 he followed
it back to the boyhood home in Ken
tucky.
It was natural that Johnson should
feel again the call of adventure when the
Mexican war broke out, and he did.
But the fates that have carried him far,
played him false on that occasion. The
Mexican war, like the Spanish Ameri
can war, saw more young men anxious
for service than the government could
use, and Johnson's company was never
ordered out. But in 18!9 he wandered
again, this time going to Buchanan
county, Missouri, which was then, be
fore the days of Kansas settlement, the
border land. He farmed there a year,
but in ISSO he was on the road again,
following the long trail of gold seekers
to California. The company he joined
crossed the river at the present site of
Atchison. Of the wagon train which he
joined, many of the teams were oxen,
and painfully slow for a man going to
pick up a fortune. So lohnson, and
several of his companions, who had
swifter beasts, and were in a hurry,
went on. Seventy-rive days out of Atchi.
son they reached Placerville,Cal Seven
ty-five days, and they were in a hurry!
Now it is a scant three days' journey on
comfortable cars. There have been some
changes in a half century.
Placerville was then known as Hang
town, and it didn't get that name with
out earning it. The California which
Johnson knew was the California of
Brete Harte. A land of gold camps, and
gamblers, bad men, and vigilantes to
make them be gocd. If they wouldn't
be good, they were hanged, and there
were other Hangtowns besides Placer
ville. For eight years Mr Johnson
dabbled in mining as it was done in the
early days, without becoming a bonanza
king. Then he hit the long trail again,
coming home a longer route than he took
going out. From San Francisco, he
went by ship to the Isthmus of Panama,
which he crossed on a train which re
quired two engines to lift it over the
narrow Isthmina divide. The ride over
that ridge made a lasting impression on
Mr Johnson; so strong an impression
that to-day he is among the doubters as
to the ultimate success or the Panama
canal. Hej says the government will
never get enough water in the big ditch
to float a ship.
From the Carribean terminal of the
Panama railroad, Johnson took ship- to
Cuba, then and for years after a Spanish
colony. But he tarried there only long
enough to catch the next ship to New
Orleans. From New Orleans, he came
up the Mississippi and Missouri rivers
to Atchison, which had been growing
into something of a pioneer city in the
meantime. But, while he came to Kan
sas in time to be a pioneer, as he had
been in Kentucky, Texas, Missouri and
California, as on the long route which
joined them, this state proved to be
what he was looking for. It has proved
that for many others, as those who have
left only to return, can testify, and it is
proof of their wisdom that they linger
here, after wandering far in search of
something better.
Perhaps it was the California ex
perience which caused Mr Johnson to be
a leader in a movement to organize a
vigilance committee, which helped to
promote order in this then somewhat
disorderly region. Oh one occasion in
the early days in Kansas, Mr Johnson
and Nat Kimbirlin, his brother-in-law,
had returned from driving a herd of
hogs to market, and had considerable
money with them. They received a hint
to look out for robbers that night, and
concealed themselves in front of their
log house, under a work bench. They
were armed with shotguns and revolvers.
They did not wait long before two men
came, whose actions were decidedly
suspicious. But before the bandits had
time to enter the house, the men in
ambush opened fire with their shotguns,
and the robbers tied, leaving a trail of
blood through the cornfield ; also leaving
their hats, horses, saddles and bridles.
The next day Johnson and a friend
called on a neighbor near by, and, on
entering the house, found hlood all over
the floor. They thought the robbers of
the night before had found refuge there,
but Hie blood proved to be that of rabbits
which had been thrown on the l!oor, ond
the robbcis were never located.
F ; or a number of years Mr Johnson
has lived a retircJ life in Uvercst. Two
yearn ago lie suffered a stroke of paraly
sis, which left him nearly helpless, but
mind and memory arc still as bright B9
ever. The interesting story lie might
tell, or the many interesting stories, are
merely hinted at in this brief sketch.
Eight years in California's early gold
camps ; a pioneer of five states ; a dwel
ler on the outer rim for more than the
normal span of life. Surely there are
books and books, but not all of them
have been written. And there is one
worth while under "Uncle Johnny"
Johnson's hat at Everest.
The Probation Case
Since the publication in the Prospect
last week, of the conditions of the pro
bation in Amador county case, we have
been surprised at the wide interest ex
presed In the nutter. We believe this
was the first time in any of the neigh
boring counties, that the new law has
been applied in a serious case, and the
general opinion seems to be that a gract
step has been taken in the way of re
forming criminals. It seems to be par
ticularly fortunate that Judge Wood, in
this case should make tha terms of the
probation so explicit, and at tha same
time so binding that there is no pre
mium offered for the commission of
crime. The young man in this case,
cannot consider himself a free man till
the term of his probation expires. He
is in the hands of the law as he should
be for his crime. B.;t instead of being
herded with confirme I criminals there
to complete his education, and come out
a curss to society and himself, he is
given a chance to reform, . and lay tha
foundation for an honest life. When
his term expires, instead of stepping
forth naked, and poverty stricken, ready
for the first criminal job at hand, with
which to secure the means of susten
ance, he will, if he has well followed
the conditions of his probation, find
himself with a comfortable little sum o
money saved up, a habit of labor
formed, and will be in condition to con
tinue in honest employment, with his
record cleared of all shame and infamy.
There ia something worth looking
ahead to. To be sure he must work, but
he works with the promise of reward.
In prison he would \vork«too, and with
nothing to show for it at the end of his
term, but a blasted name and a crimi
nal record.
COMFORTING WORDS

happened to read about Doan's Kidney
Pills and procuring a box, I began their

made a trip to Bellville.
John Doyle, our groceryman, is doing
poor business. His store is dirty and
dusty and noxiously odiferous. How
can he expect to do much?
Reverend Styx preached last Sunday
on charity. His sermon was very punk.
Dave Sliunkey died at his home in
this place. The doctor gave it out as
heart failure, but the truth is he was
drunk and whiskey killed him.
Married— Miss Sylvia Rhodan and
James Canahan last Saturday at the
Baptist parsonage. The bride is a very
ordinary town girl and knows no more
about cooking than a rabbit, and never
helped her mother more than three days
in her life. She is not a beauty by any
means, and has a gait like a duck.
The groom is a well known up-to-ditc

folks all his life and doesn't amount to
shucks. They will have a haid life.

Jan. 6— Editor Ledger: Your corres

years the parties mentioned had lived in
California. It was continuous residence
Mr Greg; claimed. Robert Jameson
raised his family in El Dorado county,'
and 1 think claims that for his residence
yet. W. Sharp and the Deaver brothers
have all been out of the state for some
time. Mrs Erauw lived in Sacramento
quite a while. Ido not know about the
others he mentioned. Mrs B. Satch
well and her stepdaughter came the
plains across, and arrived in Fiddle
town on the first day of September and
have lived in Amador county ever since
1853. The younger one of the party,
who was in her twelfth year, could not
think she was in California. She ex
pected to see gold knockers on the door,
but instead she saw nothing but little
shanties that reminded her of stables
which she saw in Chicago, and she did
not hear a fiddle.
That paper directed to Penry and Son
was quite a feather in the cap of the
Ledger. A party a short time ago went
into the Dispatch office, (they were
strangers to one another.) He inquired,
'who is boss here.' They looked at
each other, but finally caught on and the
young man made out the receipt. We
are waiting to hear from you about that
raise in the county expenses from twenty
thousand to a hundred thousand. 1 fcr

What Sheriff Gregory
Went to Texas for
In answer to your question "where
were you and upon what business during
your absence" my answer is:
I went to San Angelo, Texas, in the in
terst of the prosecution in the case of
the state of Texas vs. H. B. Knowles,
charged with perjury. The facts in the
case are as follows . In the year ISM
Knowles sold a valuable jack to one
Vrooman, and soon thereafter Knowles
stole the same jr.ck from a large pasture
where Vrooman had put the animal and
run the ja:k off to another county and
sqld it. Knowles then came back to
San Angelo and took h common burro,
worth $8 or 810, and^ killed or crippled
it, and then placed it on the railroad
track. Knowles then informed Vrooman
that the train had run over and killed
the fine jack that he (Knowles) had sold
him. Vrooman sued the railroad, und
on trial Knowles swore that the jack
that was on the railroad track was Vroo
man's—the valuable one that Knowles
had sold to Vrooman. The railroad
detective afterwords found Vrooman's
jack in Jones county, where Knowles
had sold it, and Knowles was indicted
for perjury by the grand jury. Knowles
gave bonds in the sum of $4000, which
he forfeited, and ccme to West Point in
Calaveras county, Cal. where he kept a
saloon for a short time. He then went
to Nashville, in El Dorado county, and
engaged in the same business under ths
iiame of J. N. Padget.
On the night of September 1, Padget
murdered John Smith, a 17 year old half
breed Indian at Nashville, and escaped
and fled to Alaska, where he went under
the name of Alanley. Last year, Know
les was taken back to Texas from
Seattle to answer to the old perjury
change. He gave bail again, and again
forfeited it not, appearing for trial at
the May term of this district court, but
he showed up again in fan Angelo just
prior to the December term of court and
demanded a trial.
In Texas the indictment expires in
three years if the defendant is in the
state and can be brought to trial.
Knowles claimed to have been in Texas
all that tt me, whereas in truth and in
fact he was in California, and it was
necessary to prove that fact, aiid the
witnesses from California were taken
there for the purpose of identifying
defendant. Upon seeing him they
positively recognized him as the man
Padget who was here in 1894 and 1895,
and as the man who murdered Smith on
the 12th day of September, 1895, at
Nashville.
The trial came on, the jury was im
paneled and the prosecution had ample
testimony to secure a conviction, but
fortunately for Knowles and unfortunate
ly for the state the defense discovered a
clerical error in the indictment, and
after three days argument the judge
ruled against the state, quashing the
main counts in the indictment and in
structed the jury to acquit the defendant.
I thereupon wired to the authorities of
El Dorado county, asking them if they
wanted the man, but received no reply.
Since my return home I have been in
formed that the district attorney of El
Dorado county has the matter under ad
visement, and will soon determine
whether he will extradite Knowles for
the El Dorado crime.
I found while in Texas that Knowles
has a previous bad record, being charged
with the murder of an old Mexican
sheepherder in 1890 in Schleicher
county, Texas, and suspicioned of
various other crimes. It seems too bad
that such , a criminal should go un
punished, and I hope and believe that
he will yet be compelled to face trial for
some of his crimes."

The Da! Porta brothers are putting a
new galvanized iron roof on the court
house. The building has been covered
heretofore with tin. and' malthdid- paper
roofing, but the weather manages to get
through both. Now it is proposed to
reinforce these materials with galvanized
iron. Studding is placed over the old
roof, and the iron fastened thereto. This
method ought to fix the building water
tight for a few winters anyway.
W. F. Detert some time ago bought
the New London Aline from the state, to
whom it had been deeded for delinquent
taxes. It was afterward discovered that
all the back taxes had not been included
in the notice of sale, as the property had
been assessed under another name— the
Lucille. So to make the title straight,
the prooerty was again advertised for
sale for the delinquent taxes omitted
before, and Mr Detert again became the
purchaser, thereby perfecting his title to
this promising mining ground, which
lies immediately north of the once
famous Plymouth Consolidated mine.-
The weather for the past week has
continued unusually cold. The self-regis
tering thermometer of the Ledger office
have not marked higher than 58 degrees

date of 13.21 inches.

The "government stroke" a phrass
applied to tin work, shirking which is a

work, was strikingly exemplified in the
vicinity of Jackson the other day. A
couple of men supposed to be at work
&.i the public road were noticed seated
by the roadside about half-past nine
o'clock in the morning. They had a
fire lighted in the roadway, and were
leisurely preparing coffee. It was a
keen frosty morning, and they evidently
needed something stronger than the
"governent stroke" to warm the phy-.

taxpayers are paying their money for

Alining Location
Some commotion was created in, min
ing circles early this week by the loca
tion of a piece of mineral land im
mediately south of the Muldoon claim,
now known as the Kennedy Extension.
It was not generally known that any
government land existed along the main
mineral belt in that vicinity, although
it is said the ground in question was
located nine or ten years ago, and al
lowed to ; lapse for non performance of
assessment work. Lately, W< 'f;E.
Downs was' surveying for the Argonaut
company, and in running his lines dis
covered that a tract of about 60 feet
along the lode line was unclaimed. Jos.
Phelps, the assayer of the Argonaut
company, thereupon posted location
notices calling for 60x600 feet, and had
the same recorded in the county re
corder's office.

The Expert Business
The expert engaged to examine the
books of county officers was appointed
one year ago, at a per diem of 85. The
report has not yet been made. The
salary still goes on, for all that has ap
peared to the contrary. The authority of
the supervisors to create an office in
that fashion is ooen to serious question.
It has been decided that they have no
power to create a salaried office, and if
their action in this matter does not
press the line to the limit we are much
mistaken. The total sum already paid
out on this expert we will give at an
early date. The matter is becoming a
topic of comment throughout the county,
and taxpayers are inquiring how much
longer this drain is to continue. The
grand jury has not finally adjourned.
That body may be called together at any
time. This matter would seem to be a
very appropriate subect to take up and
act upon. Between bounty laws and e.\
perting the burden of the taxpayers has
been increased at the rate of fully 5
cents on each 8100. That is doing fairly
well.
You'll feel better after taking DeWitt's
Little Early Risers, the safe, sure,
pleasant, gentle little liver pills. If you
would be sure of good results insist on
DeWitt's Ccrbolied Witch Hazel Salve;

First Payment in
The Probation Case
One of the conditions of the proba

Walker was to the effect that out of his
first earnings he should pay to the
county treasurer the costs of the crimi

81G. On the 12th instant, after receiv
ing his first pay from the Kennedy
Company he paid that amount to
treasurer Gritton, so that he his repaid
to the county the costs incurred in the
prosecution. He is employed steadily at
the Kennedy.

LANDES SHEPHERDS.
French Peasants Who Are Experts In
Walking on Stilts.
There is a vast district in France
where the entire community goes
about and transacts Its business on
stilts. This district is called "Les
Laudes." /•//
The inhabitants, who are aviong the
poorest peasants in France, gain ttieir
subsistence by fishing, by such little
agriculture as is possible and by keep
ing cows and sheep. The shepherds
make use of their stilts for two pur
poses—first, because walking is quite
impossible on account of tbe sage nud
undergrowth of brush, and, second.
fDecause the height of their stilts gives
them a greater range of vision.
The stilts generally nre about six or
seven feet high. Near the top there is
a support for the foot, which has a
strong stirrup and strap, and still
nearer the top a band of leather fas
tens the stilt firmly to the leg just be
low the knee. Some stilts, especially
those made for fancy walking and for
tricks, are even higher than seven
feet, and the man who uses these—
and ho must be an expert— can travel
as fast as ten miles an hour. The
lower end of this kind of stilt Is
capped with a sheep bone to prevent
its splitting.
Some of these Lnndes shepherds are
wonderfully clever in the management
of their stilts. They run races, step
or jump over brooks, clear fences and
walls and are able to keep their bal
ance and equilibrium while stooping
to the ground to pick Tip pebbles or to
gather wild (lowers'. They fall prone
upon their faces and assume their
perpendicular without an ulToi&. and
in a single moment after they have
thus prostrated themselves.— Technical

but he Is just as far from it as when
a boy.
I believe this condition has all come
from the habit of unliappiness which
lie formed during his hard boyhood
and which he has never beeu able to
overcome. He has learned to look for

Vulture and Rattler.
An odd battle between n California
vulture !ind a rattlesnake wns wit
nessed In rhe Cocopuft mountains of
Lower California. It was In tlie early
morning. The bis bird hud seized the
snsike behind the head and was strug
gling upward with Its writhing, deadly
burden. The snake's captor appeared
aware that its victim was dangerous.
The burden was heavy, sis the reptile
was nearly tive feet lonjr.
The fjrjp «'f the bird on the snake's
body, wiis not of the best. The snake
seemed In he sipiirmln^; from its cup

It did rhis once or twice, nnd then
with a shriek the vulture dropped Its

or so iilxive th* % observers. The as
tonished lii.Mi wer*» then treated to a
spectacle seldom seen. Few birds but
a vultuiv t-oiiitl accomplish such a font.
Tin 1 instant the Hiiiike escaped from
rhe bird's clutches it dropped earth

bird dropped after it. witching It in
midair wlrh a grip that caused death.

Amador County
Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises an area of
648equa.ro miles. It lies on the wes
tern slope of Sierra Novaek 1 nountalns,
nnd emuracoa within it? territory all
tho diversity, of valley, foothill, and
hitfh mountainous lands.
Climate.— The climate of tho popu
lous portions of Ibo county is as genial
and healthful an can be found anywhere
in California. As climate is one of the
most valuable, tisae.ts of this favored
state. In attracting population. Amador
stands second to no county in this re*
gard. It should, and no doubt will in
time, when Its climatic advnntiiges are
more thoroughly understood nnd ap
preciated, become a health resort not
only for tlioso in loss favored slates,
but for the residents of other parts of
California, Tho temperature alono tho
central portion ■ rarely fulls below 30
degrees above zero In winter, and as
rutely rises to 100 degrees in the sum
mer. Snow Miloom fulls In tho settled
dlntrictP, and never remains on the
pround for moro than a few hours. Of
course, in tho higrh mountain regions
of eastern Amador the snowfall is very
heavy— which is characteristic of tho
entire Sierra Nevada range. The sum
mer season is alway accompanied with
cool nights; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs are rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
Infrequent. .
Gold Mining.— The county, although
rich in other sources of wealth, com
paratively untouched, is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. The
deepest, gold mines in America lire lo
cated here. The Kennedy mine is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from'
quartz extracted from a depth of over
3000 feet below the surface, with every
indication that tho pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold, the couuty has contrib
uted fully $100,OOOOCO to the world's
supply of the precious metal. The
mines are still yielding at the rate of
about two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
eight or ten mines operating on what
is called the "mother lode," stretching
clear across the county In a north-east
erly direction a distance of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate between
400 and 500 stamps, and furnish em
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
industry is still in its infancy. The
unexplored territory, even along the
main gold belt, is far in excess of tho
ground that has actually been worked
or prospected . The county offers to
day one of the most inviting fields to
be found anywhere in the world for the
investment of capital in the fascinating
business of gold mining, not alono along
the mother lode, but also in the almost
untouched mineralized country ol the
east belt, some ton or twelve miles from
the main lode.
Besides gold, wo have copper, de
posits of pottery, coal, -marbe, slate,
limestone, granite, and soapstone or
talc — all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities . — The agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce anything that can be
grown in the most favored sections.
In the foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetable are raised where irrigation
is practicable along 1 the numerous water
courses. Further up in the mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet, the
soil is admirably adapted for apples
and pDtatoos. A ready market for
many times the quantity now raised of
these commodities can bo found in the
various mining towns.
Grape culture and wlnemaking are
becoming important industries, both
the grapes and wine commanding a
better price than the product of the
lowland.
Land Is cheap compared with other
California lands. Improved farms may
be secured for one-fourth the price
current in some places. Unimproved
lands can be had from $5 to $10 per
acre. It does not require a fortune to
buy a small ranch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agriculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts now devoted to
cattle ranges might bo made the homes
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amador has a population of less than
12000. Threo fourths of this is concen
trated in a strip of three miles above
and below the mineral belt.
Jackson, the county seat, has about
2500 inhabitants, and isan Incorporated
city ot tho sixth class. Other towns
are Sutter Creek, Amador City, Dry
town, Plymouth, Volcano, Pino Grove
and Oleta. lone City is the metropolis
of tho valley section, a thriving town
of 1000 Inhabitants.
Thecommunlty is law abiding. Edu
cational facilities are excellent. A
schoolhouße is within oiwy reach of
nearly every family. There is one high
school, located at lone.
The assessment roll for 11)09 Is $">..
800,703, and the tax rate for both state
and county purposes $2 on the $100.
The Southern l'acilie has a branch
railroad running to lone. From this
point the lone and Eastern railroad ex
tends 14 miles further to the mining!
section.

lng before my Uliti'rlUtfe wljile explor

1 came upon a trunk, which I opened
and found to contain sundry UuieU-
Uiiiii-ks. all evidently very old. * One
was a diijLiue.rreot.vpi! of a filrli anotb
er n pasteboard box tied with a faded
ribbon. I opened the box and found a
small piece of wedding cuke, dried to
a orlsp. Girls, yon know, sleep with
wedding cake under (heir pillows to
Intlueiice their dreams. I took die
piece I found away with me and that
night slept with it under my pillow.
"1 dreamer] ibis dream:
"I was walking In otic of those old
fashioned gardens still common in old
New lOunlaiifl. and more so In the
southern states. Inclosed by a htyh
wall. Through a vista of trees and
(lowers I could fee the rear of a house.
Thi'oujjh a door opening on to a porch
cami 1 a young man and a girl. The
man wore a frock coat with brass but
tons, a profusion or neckwear and
trousers strapped beneath his shoes.
He carried a cane. The k'u'l's dress
was covered with flowers, and her
hair, parted in the center of her head,
was plastered down over lior temples.
The two came toward me over a walk
bordered, with boxwood, and as t|iey
drew near I recognized the girl wliose
daguerreotype 1 bad seen in the trunk
in the f;iirret. The man's face looked
familiar, but I could not place It.
"They were talUliis excitedly, but
what they said I did not hear. Indeed.
I didn't hear their voices: I only knew
they were discussing some subject of
vital importance to them. Suddenly
it wooden door in the garden wall open
ed, and another man entered. He. too.
was, .voting and dressed in the same
fashion as the man walking with rhe
;;li'l. On his entrance she save a cry.
and tho two yoiiny men stood and glar
ed at each other. There \v;ts some con
fusion in my dream from this point
for awhile, and the next feature I re
member distinctly was seeing the ivan
who had come out of the house with
the girl pull his walking stick in iwo
pieces, separatiiiin' it Just below, the
handle. The upper part was a lonj*;
thin piece of steel. With it he rusbed
upon the man who had entered last
and stabbed him. The steel with

conditions produced by had dreams.
Had mine been the consequence of
some internal ailment like Indigestion
1 might have quieted down and gone
to sleep. But my seeing In the £irl the
person whose likeness 1 had found in
the trunk convinced me that I had
been carried back to some scene en
acted in the past. Consequently 1 pu/.
z!ed over It till morning and arose on
my wedding day. having slept only it
few hours. At breakfast father, notic
ing my appearance, looked at me aux
iously and asked me If 1 were ill. 1
(old him my dream.
"After my return from my honey
moon father told me the family se
cret. My grandmother, his mother,
was a New Orleans creole. A coo,uetto.
she had encouraged two suitors. The
scene I had dreamed had been enacted
in Ihe garden behind her father's
house in that city. My grandmother
had chosen life young man who had
entered the garden with her. Ills

When the narrator ceased t lie In

she wished to know If I had any the

transported her back to witness what
had occurred more than sixty years
before. 1 said thlH tojier:

I-'rcczing with carbon dioxide is a
novel curative process, the exact value
of which is not yet known. When the
compressed gas is allowed to escape
from a cylinder some of it condenses as
snow, and this is rammed into a tube of
metal or vulcanite, forming a solid
round or square rod. With a piece of
lint one end of the rod may be held in
the hand, while the other end may he
pared to any shape with a knife. On
applying the free end to the skin, the
surface is at once frozen by the intense
cold, and striking effects follow the
usual application of 30 to 00 seconds.
Little or no pain is felt. Thawing takes
place promptly, and swelling follows in
two .or three minutes, while a blister
often appears within an hour. So far
the freezing has been applied with good
results in such skin affections as birth
marks, warts and some moles. ■
Recent evidence tends to show that the
soil has sterilizing as well as the
fertilizing bacteria. At the Rothamsted
Experimental Strtion in England, Drs.
E. J. Russell and H. B. Hutchinson
have partially sterilized soil by heating
to about 200 deg. F. , or treating wiih a
volatile antiseptic like carbon disul
phide, and have found that productive
ness becomes greater for a time through
increased production of ammonia, due to
rapid increase of bacteria. This remark
able effect of incomplete sterilization is
attributed to a destruction of competing
organisms. The discovery of some
means of suppressing the undesirable
soil organisms would appear to be an
important advance, and this problem is
now receiving attention.
The naturai food of the New Zealand
kea is fruits, roots, honey, worms and
insect?, and the strange stories of sheep
"killing by this parrot have been serious
ly doubted. G. K. .Marriner, curator
of the museum at Wanganui, has found
the bird convicted by the most positive
evidence. With horrible cruelty this
extraordinary bird tears out the kidneys
o* its victim wh'le clinging to the only
foothold it can keep during the tortured
animal's struggles, and sheep-owners
lose five per cent of their flocks yearly.
A new' region of wonders, quite un
known to our unaided perceptions, has
been opened up by a combination of the
ultramicroscope and the cinematograph.
The former is an ordinary microscope
using a powerful ray of light from one
side, and, while it does not accurately
reveal sizes and shapes, organisms and
other soild particles far too small to be
even detected by ordinary observation
are raade to appear as bright points on a
dark background and their, position and
movements are clearly shown. With
great care and patience, Dr. Comandon,
a French investigator, has photographed
upon moving films both microscopic end
u'.tramiscopic scenes, adapting for each
the illumination of an intense pencil of
light from an electric arc. In the cine
matograph the films throw upon a screen
moving pictures and the objects thus
reproduced may be magnified as much as
10,000 diameters,— ar. enlargement that
would make a flea as big as a six story
bouse if so Immense a creature could be
shown entire. The movements, in the
blood, of corpuscles and disease germs
are among the instructive views that can
be brought out. One set of moving
pictures shows the blood of a mouse in
fected with a trypanoscme similar to
that of sleeping sickness, and the or
ganisms—actualiv 1-1250 to 1-250 cf an
inch long— appear as swift-moving giant
caterpillars a foot or mcra in length. In
another scries of pictures, a tadpole's
tail is a mass of cells travcised by a
riv:r of blood, which whirls the oval
blocd corpuscles along like 'pebbles in a
mountain torrent.
Portland cement lias been produced
from iho waste slag of blast-furnaces,
end a new process — now being tested in
Liverpool— .makes another useful build
ing material by adding sand and guplhale
of scda, sometimes wiih a little lime to
convert the slag into glass. With or
without inclosed wire, this glass 'may
be cast or rolled into artificial slates,
paving blocks, building blccks, bricks
slabs or tiles. Much is expecied from
the sing roofing slate which costs less
thin hall' it much as the "natural slate
of Wclcs, is translucent, can be made of
any size or shape and in eny one of
i:everel colors and is absolutely rain
proof.
CliJs3-hsrd steel rods at Brown Uni
versity lirvc lost 20 per cent in electrical
rcsistf.r.cos in IMS. It is infer:ed that,
ct oidinary temperature?, glass-hard
nieel would become completely softened
in 250 years.
Building-walls of cley reinforced with
wiremesh, as devised by W. Paetz, of
Harburg, Gernmny, are claimed to have
proven very satisfactory, and a two
family house with stable is said to have
been built at a cost of but $2,(K)!). The
reinforcement consists of inner and the
outer sheets of wire fabric, with hori
zontal sheets at intervals not exceeding
the thickness of the wall. If heavy loads
are to be borne, a layer of cement mortar
is placed between successive courses of
clay. Window openings arc framed with
cement mortar dovetailed with the clay
work. The exterior is given a coating
of neat cement mortar with such ad
ditional plastering. and dressing as may
be desired; and the inside wall surfaces,
after being first well dried, receive also
the coating of neat cement mortar and
arc then plastered. Timber studding is
usad for wall-plates, floors, roof fram
ing and partitions. Sheets of metal
fabric are nailed on each side of the
partition-studding, and the space be
tween is Filled with clay,, well tamped.
As used for buildings the clay has little
moisture— just sutticient to permit it to
be tamped into a soild mass.
Estimates of tree-ages from the so
called annular rings appear to be of
doubtful accuracy. H. N. Thompson,
conservator of forests for southern
Nigeria, has found reason for believing
that mahogany trees show three or four
well marked zones of growth in a year—
instead of only one, — and he suggests
that a new ring is formed each season.
The same observation has been made
both on forest trees and on those grown
in the botanical garden. The town oi'
Ijaye was destroyed sixty years ago, and
on its site lias grown a forest containing
mahogany trees with trunks more than
ten feet in circumference.
The statement that gas engines are 50
per cent less liable to breakdowns than
steam engines has aroused a discussion,
from which it appears that many insur
ance engineers regard'the small gascngine
as more reliable than the small steam
engine, but consider the reverse to be

The Woman With
The FooSish Tongue.
She's sometimes old— and sometimts
young,
The woman with the foolish tongue;
The pratting voice, the glinting eye,
The things she's got to tell— or die!
Who chatters with a vacant noise,
Just listening to her own sweet voice,
Who corners you in some dim nook—
And then runs on— just like "the
brook."
In mournful numbers, be she sung,
The woman with the foolish tongue,
Who to her conversation clings,
Until you cry, "Lord, give me wings
That 1 somehow from her may fly,
For she will never say goodby !"
Siie talks, and talks, and talks all day,
With ne<'cr anything to say.
She fancies she's a fascinator,
But just like some steam radiator
She buzzes on with tireless lung,
The woman with the foolish tongue.
Lord, grant that never such as she
May hunt me down and marry me !
I'd be a raving maniac,
With not a chance to answer back.
Lord pity him who weds when young
A woman with a foolish tongue!

"DIXIE'
The southern song " Dixie" lias been
proclaimed as the greatest in patriotic
popularity" among American songs and
music. The decision ,'s by O. G. T.
Sonncck, chief of the division of music
of the iihrarv of congress, who has just
issued 'from the government presses a
volume giving a:i exhaustive Report oi)
American national nirs. "Yankee
Doodle" got necond place. A remark
able thing nbnut "Dixie" is that it was
written by a native of f lic North, Gen.
Albert Pike. He was born in Mas
sachusetts In 1809 and became teacher.
In 18.M he visited the southwest with a
company of trappers and afterwards
settled at Little Rock, where ho edited a
paper and practiced law. He served
In the Mexican war and at the outbreak
of the civil war enlisted with the
Confederates. It was early in the war
that he wrote the lines. pu^ft islicd in the
Charleston Courtier in 1801. The song
immediately became popular throughout
the South. There is sonic, question as
to the ori;;in of the air, but the words
and music are said to have been inspired
by an old negro melody which was sung
by Daniel Hmmc't, of Emrriett & Bryan's
minstrels just before the civil war.
"Yankee Doodle" is claimed by
several nations. The air, it is said,
was popular in the south of France two
centuries ago, and the reapers of Hol
land sang it as they worked. In the
reign of Charles 1 in England, it was
sung by the cavaliers in derision of
Cromwell, who had entered Oxford on
an exceedingly small horse. It first ap
pcard in America in 1755, when Gen.
Braddock assembled the .colonists near
Albany to attack the French and Indian?.
Dr. Richard Shuckburg, a wag and
musician with the English soldiers,
wrote out the music for the poorly
trained colonial musicians, and turned
it over to them as the latest martial
music from England. The joke proved
a poor one, for twenty-five years later
the air was played when the British
marched into the lines of the colonists
to surrender.AMADOU LEDGER.'

GUN COTTON.
A Peculiar Ch«r«cteri«tie of ThU T«r-
riblo Explosive.
Many njid odd iiru the tnnteflflla en
tering Into thu iiiiintifiu-tur« of inodcrn
explosives, but i)Pi'li.'ip« the most imor
estlng of all those olfinents of destruc
tion ns well us the simplest Is nun cot
ton. Tbe gnu cottou nuniufoctui'lng In
dustry li larfre. uh enortnuuit quantities
ore usou In the charging of torpwloos
and for similar purposes.
The uuse of gun cotton la pure raw
cotton or even cotton waste, mich us U
used to clean machinery. This Is steep
ed In n solution of one part of nitric
and three p.-irta of sulphuric acid. It Is
the former Ingredient thut renders tin
mass explosive, the sulphuric acid lie-
Ing used merely to übsorb nil moisture,
thus permitting the nitric ncld to com
bine more readily with the cellulose of
the cotton.
Aflor being sonl;«l for several hours
in the solutlou described the cotton
Is passed between rollers to expel
all nonabsorbed acid, a process curried
to completion by washing the cottou In
clear water. This washing process Is a
long one. requiring machinery which
reduces the cotton to a mass resem
bling paper pulp. Should any uonub
sorbed acid be allowed to remain v
■would decompose the cotton.
If the explosive Is to be used after
the manner of powder It Is Ntill fur
ther pulverized and then thoroughly
dried, but If Intended for tr-^ ciloes It
Is pressed Into cakes of various shapes
and sizes-disk shapod. cylindrical, tjiil
squares and cubes. When not com
pressed gun cotton Is very light, as
light as ordinary batting.
A peculiar characteristic of this ter
rlbli' explosive is that a brick of It
when wet may be placed on a bed ol
hot coals, and as the moisture dries out
the cotton will flake and burn quietly.
If dry originally, however, the gun cot
ton will explode with terrible force at
abntit 320 degrees of heat.
In general it is the custom to ex
plode gun cotton by detonation or an
intense shock Instead of by heat, in a
torpedo the explosive charge is wet.
this wet cotton being exploded by
means of dry cottou in a tube, this
hating been tired by a cap of fulmi
nate of mercury, the cap Itself having
been fired by the linpnct of the torpedu
against tlie target.— Harper's Weekly.
UNDER THE OCEAN.
Things That Happen at the Bottom
of the Sea.
Naturalists dispute as to tlie quantity
of light at tlie bottom of the sea. Ani
mals from below 700 fathoms either
have uo eyes or faint Indications of
them, or else their eyes are very large
and protruding.
Another strange thing is that if tbe
creatures in tbe lower depths have any
color it is orange or red or reddish
orange. Sea anemones, corals, shrimps
and crabs have tliis brilliant color.
Sometimes it is pure red or scarlet,
and in many specimens it inclines to
ward purple. Not a green or blue fish
is found.
The orange red is the Osh's protec
tion, for the bluish green light iv the
bottom of the ocean inalses the orange
or the red tish appear of a neutral tint
and hides it from its enemies. Many
animals are black, others neutral In
color. Some ttsu are provided with
boring tails, so that they can burrow
•in the mud.
The surface of the submarine mount
taiu is covered wltli shells, like an or
dinary seabeach. showing that It Is the
feasting, place of vast shoals of car
nivorous animals.
A codfish takes a whole oyster Into
its mouth, cracks tlie shell, digests the
meat and ejects the shell. Crabs crack
the shells aud suck out the meat. This
accounts for whole mounds of shells
that are often found.
Not a tishboue is ever found that
is not honeycombed by the boring
shellfish and falls to pieces at the
touch of the hand. This shows what
destruction is constantly going on In
these depths.
If a ship sinks at sea with all on
board It will In* mitmi by lish. with the
exception of Hie nietnl. and that will
eorrpda and disappear. Not a bone ot
a human body will remain after a few
days.— Philadelphia North Amertcau.
