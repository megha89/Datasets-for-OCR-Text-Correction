THE RAILROAD SCARE
ODD EFFECTS OF THE FIRST SIGHT
OF A LOCOMOTIVE.
iojue of the People of the South Hid
Behind Trcos In 1883, 'When the
Iron Hone Went By— The Casntry'a
Earliest Railroad.
America cannot lay claim to the first
locomotive or the first railroad. { That
pi-eat honor lies . with England. Yet
Yankee genius was not very far behind
her, for, when George Stephenson
launched his first real locomotive, the
Rocket, on the Liverpool and Manches
ter road hi IS2O, the first spike had been
driven on tbe Baltimore and Ohio' rail
road, July 4, 1828, by Charles Carroll
i>f Carrollton, tbe last surviving signer
of tbe Declaration of Independence.
This -was the first road started In the
United States, and In 1830 it bad reach
ed Elllcott Mills. 13 miles from Balti
more. " ;•*': '■ y
But tbe south can claim the honor of
completing the longest railroad In tbe
world at that date, being the old
Charleston and Hamburg road, now a
part of -the South Carolina and Georgia
system, which was begun in 1830, and
by October, 1833, it bad 137 miles of
track in operation. In a letter from
Mr. Samuel C. Clarke of Georgia, a
kinsman of the writer, who attained
tbe extreme age of 01 years and who
bad seen tbe beginning and the comple
tion of this road, he thus gives his ex
perience upon first sight of a locomo
tive:
"One day while going down to
Charleston with a party of gentlemen
to attend the races as we approached
the city we saw In the distance the
new railroad, finished some 10 or 12
miles out of Charleston. It was built
upon piles, longer or. short, according
to the nature of the ground. Sometimes
In crossing a ravine the rails were 20
feet from the surface. Our track ran
uear this elevated road, and soon a
horrid shriek as from 20 panthers was
beard In the woods. By this time we
were nervous. Elephants and lions
we had heard of, and some of us had
seen them, but what monster was this
whose screams we heard? Presently
It came in sight, flying aloft through
the air and breathing fire and smoke,"
and our frightened steeds became un
manageable, and In fact I think that
some of our parry were as badly fright
ened as tbelr horses. If any of my
readers nre old enough to remember
rbe Introduction of locomotives and
how they felt at first sight of them,
they will perhaps understand our sen
sations that day in the pine woods. *
"A mile or two farther on we came
to a broken wagon by the side of the
road, and near it sat a Georgia cracker
smoking bis pipe.' On being asked
what was his trouble he replied, 'Well,
stranger, I've often beam tell of nulli
fication, and now I reckon I've saw It
for true.' "
It is somewhat amusing now to read
of tbe superstitious dread with which
the Inhabitants looked upon the build
ing of these first railroads. Borne
thought the smoke of tbe continual
passing trains would cause a pestilence
or destroy all the crops along tbe road.
Others were afraid to ride on the cars
for fear of having tbelr breath taken
away, and the people In tbe cities ob>
jected to the railroad being. built be
cause they feared the smoke from tbe
engines would soil the clothes which
were hung out to dry.
Many are yet living who looked npon
the terrible, screeching iron monster
with awe and trepidation. Mr. Nat Me-
Gee of Ivy, Albemarle, tells a joke upon
himself that when he heard the train
coming be jumped from his horse and
got behind a tree, where be viewed it
for fear of being run over. Mr. W. ,T.
Prout, who was taking, a wagon load of
produce to Richmond, when he reached
Gordonville heard tho whistle and ter
rible noise of the approaching train,
and be and bis companions were 'so
scared that they sprang out, leaped the
fence and ran across the field to a safe
distance, leaving the wagon and team
to Its fate, but when tbe train appeared
't was only an engine and one coach.
Tho first roadbeds were formed, as
has been stated, by driving piles In the
ground,' upon the top of which were
placed wooden Etrlngers, in which were
cut a groove for the wheels to run.
These were called "wooden railroads"
and at a distance appeared like tbe ele
vated railroads In the cities of the pres
ent day. Tbe honor of this invention
was contested between John Harttnan
of Scottsville, Va., and John Williams,
an engineer of Ohio, but It did not
prove a bonanza to either, for tbe
wheels were constantly bouncing ont of
the groove, and tbe piles soon after
gave-place to solid dirt embankments,
and strap Iron rails were substituted
for tbe wooden groove. But the grad
ing -was very Imperfect and uneven,
which made riding on one of these
primitive railroads like going over a
corduroy road In a sprlngless wagon,
with tbe cars bouncing over these
rough rails to the jingling mnslc of the
windows.— Richmond Dispatch.
Do Carpets Shorten Life*
Jnst think what a horrible receptacle
of unclean things the carpet Is In the
rich English or French housel Where
there are carpets, people should on en
tering be given slippers, as In the Neth
erlands, or the footbath, as at a Turk
ish mosque. Making servants sweep
carpets la another proof that evil Is

"Something New Under Tbo Sun."
All Doctors huvn triod to cure
Catarrh by tho u*o of powders, acid
gases, inbalergaud drugs in paste form.
Their powders dry u;> tbe mucuous
membranes causing thorn to crack open

the same membranes that their makers
have aimed to cure, while pastes and
ointments cannot reach tne disease.'

Catarrh, has at last perfected a treat
ment which, when faithfully used, not

stopping tho discharges, aud curing all
inflammation. It its the only remedy
known to science that actually reaches
tho afflicted I parts. This wonderful

"Snuffles" is the only perfect
Catarrh cure ever made and is now
recognized as the only safe and positive
cure for that annoying and disgdsting
disease. It cures all inflammation
quickly and permanently and is also
wonderfully quick to relieve hay fever
or cold in the head.
Catarrh, wLen neglected, often leads
to consumption — "Snuffles" will save
you if you use it at once. It is an ordi

suaded him to try Electric Bittors, and
he was coon much bettor, butcoulinued
their use until he was wholly cured.
I am sure Electric Bitters saved his
life." This remedy expels malaria,

A Miller's Monument.
A big millstone monument over a
modest miller's grave is a unique sight
near Graytown, O. The millstone is lo
cated in the center of an old burying
ground and can be seen a mile away,
coming down the hill.
It marks the last resting place of a
happy miller of the old school, who
knew not the cares or worries of a ris
ing or falling grain market, but who
ground his corn and wheat for his
neighbors and lived contentedly on his
small profits. -
Chiseled on the back of the monu
ment Is this poem:
' A MIXER'S MONUMENT.
[A millstone taken from bis mill.]
Beneath this atone a miller lies,
Who left the world before the rise
Of modern waya of making flour
And bence passed many a happy liour.
He was not forced to speculate
Her on Chicago's movement wait.
Be did not care for foreign trade,
But sold his neighbors all he made.
Cables and telegrams were rare;
The markets did not make him swear.
Small was his mill, his profits round ;
Clear was his bead, his slumbers sound.
He envied none, he was envied not
And died contented with his lot

How To
Gain Flesh
' Persons have been known to
gain a pound a day by taking
an ounce of SCOTT'S EMUL-
SION. It is strange, but it often
happens.
the ounce produces
the pound; it seems to start the
digestive machinery going prop-
erly, so that the patient is ablg
to digest and absorb his ordinary
food, which he could not do be-
fore, and that is the way the gain
is made.
A certain amount of flesh is
necessary for health ; if you have
not got it you can get it by
taking
fteoirs ppision
You will find it fust as useful in sumrnei
as in winter, and if you are thriving upon
It don't stop because the weather is warm.

A VERY CURIOUS BIRD.
The One Tonns; Mark Twain Spring
Upon the Scientists.
Mark Twain's father was an ornithol
ogist. He had several friends who
were also enthusiasts on the subject of
birds. Whenever any one of them dis
covered a rain avis it was the custom
to have a consultation. Mark had been
a witness of several of these bird in
quests and bad noted the delight the
old men took In discussing a new
found specimen. One day It occurred
to him to provide the Hannibal orni
thologists with a real circus In the
form of n bird. He killed a crow aud
clso a barnyard rooster. Plucking out
the tail feathers of both the crow and
tlie rooster, he substituted the rooster's
tail feathers for those of the crow, pro
ducing a unique effect. When he had
the specimen nicely prepared, he went
to bis father and, handing It to him,
«rld: .- ■■' " .
"Here, father, Is a very curious bird
I shot. I thought you would be inter
ested In it."
The old gentleman gazed upon the
specimen with astonishment That
evening the ornithologists of Hannibal
were assembled In Mr. Clemens' par
lor. The rare specimen was put before
them. The discussion was long and
learned. The opinions expressed were
various. One thought the bird was an
offshoot of the bird of paradise fam
ily; others bad equally ridiculous no
tions as to Its ancestry. But there Tvas
one who refused to be swerved by the
peculiarity of the bird's tail from the
judgment that it was of the crow fam
ily.
"Why, just look here," he said, lift-
Ing the bird by Its tail feathers. He
got no further. The feathers came
out. There was a quick closing of a
door. Mr. Clemens started to leave
the room.
"Gentlemeu," he said, "please excuse
me a few moments. I will see Samuel
first and explain later." : . • .
EATING FISH.
It Is not good form to ask for a sec
ond helping of fish. %.;«".'
It is considered extremely bad form
to use a knife In dissecting fish.
A little modern fish knife, with an In
genious fork arrangement on one side,
Is now made. ,
A bit of lemon is served with broiled
find baked fish, and it is in correct form
to use tbe fingers in expressing the
juice.
Potatoes are considered a proper ac
cessory to the fish course.
Sliced cucumbers, with plain French
dressing, are also served.
With a boiled fish the. potatoes are
also usually boiled, cut Into bits or
scooped out and garnished with a little
melted butter and chopped parsley.
Never use the fingers to separate tbe
bones from tbe eatable portion of fish.
The bones must be evaded with such
dexterity as one can command without
other aid than such as a bit of bread
held in tbe left hand may furnish.
Gambling.
The -writer once spent a Saturday
afternoon In the study of a dignitary of
tbe church while the ecclesiastic strug
gled hi vain to frame an argument
against gambling to be presented to tbe
congregation on tbe morrow. He aban
doned the attempt Far be It from a
literary journal to assert powers tbe
possession of which tbe professionally
religious are fain to disclaim, yet with
submission we even venture to believe
that at least one cogent and effective
argument lies against all forms of gam
bling—one, namely, based on the truth
that wealth, great or small, is a trust
and therefore may not be put in risk.
Tbe moralist may declare that the
gambler gets, or at least wants to get,
something for nothing. Men will laugh.
They know better. Tbo. winner gave
bis chance to lose for bis winnings.
For his losses the winner got bis
chance to win. But ask tbe speculator
whether be would gamble with trust
funds held by him for orphans and
then suggest to him the one great truth
that is seizing bold of men's conscience,
tbe most hopeful sign in these perplex
ed days of social unrest, that. men are
trustees of all that they call theif'own.

Life Insurance.
It Is an interesting fact that, -what
ever the reason may be, life Insurance
Is much more popular In the United
States than in any other country. In
proportion to their numbers the Amer
ican people carry twice as much life
Insurance as tbe Britishers, five times
as much as? the Germans and eight
times as much as the French. . ■
This Is partly explained by the lai-pe
number of American policies issued to
serve other purposes than mere provi
sion for the families ,of the insured.
The scope of what may be called busi
ness as distinguished from family In
surance is constantly enlarging. A nov
el and interesting recent development
of It is tbe Insurance of the lives of
Protestant ministers for large sums
which are made payable at their deaths
to their churches.— New York World.

sally condemned, bnt when Eome one
proposed "Conscious as we are of each

CARD PLAYERS' CRAMP."
What Ouoe Happened to an Old Faro
Deolac's Hand.
"Were you ever paraly2ed?" said the
old timer.
"No, and may the"— began the other.
"Well,- you see that right hand? It
/ooks pretty good and strong and it is,
but for about three days once It was
deader than a frostbitten tomato plant.
"You know ef course that I used to
makemy living playing cards, chiefly
dealing bank.; There wasn't a day I
didn't deal bank or in other games six
to eight hours a day. • Many a time I
have dealt or played longer.
"One night ; I was dealing bank. It
was a good, big game. . All at once
when I went to slip a card this old
right refused to work. I- looked at it
and the fingers were kind of twisted
Inward and the hand from the wrist
was bent downward.
/This stopped the deal for me, and I
told .'the, lookout. 'to get"busy,'. for tue
players were getting a little 'queered.'
He took my. place, and I watched the
bets.
"I rubbed my right, but it wouldn't
straighten out and it kept this way
until tho next day, and then I went to
a doctor.. lie didn't know me as well
es you do, but the first question he
asked was: .
" 'Deal cards a great deal, don't you?'
" 'Yes.'
" 'Do you deal with an elbow move- ;
ment or with finger and wrist move
ment?'!. ■ . .. ..- • . ,-. ■■
" "Why, I don't work my elbow.'
"'That explains it You . have card
players' paralysis.'
"This hit me center, and 1 showed it.
but the doctor was good and said:
" 'Now, don't get flurried. . ; I'll
straighten you up. Just quit dealing
awhile; and I'll give your hand a few
doses of electricity, and you'll be all
right.'
j "He did It, and In about three days
my hand was straight as a string. But
I haven't dealt so much since. There's
many an old timer whose dealing hand
has quit him. '. And you say you were
ne ver paralyzed ?" '
"Well, you ain't played cards much."

When 'the civil war ended, tho little
town of Pulaski, . Tcnn., welcomed a
band of young men who, though they
were veterans . of . hard fought fields,
were for the most part no older than
the mass of college students. In the
general poverty, the exhaustion, the
lack of heart, naturally prevalent
throughout the beaten south, young
men had more leisure than was good
for them.
A southern country town, even In the
halcyon days before the war, was uot
a particularly lively place, and Pulaski
In ISGG was doubtless rather tame to
fellows who had seen Plckett charge
at Gettysburg or galloped over tbe
country with Morgan and Wheeler. A
group of them assembled in a law office
one evening iv May, 1866, were discuss
ing ways and means of having a live
lier, time. Some one suggested a club
or society. An organization with no
very definite aims was effected, and at
a second meeting, a week later, names
were proposed and discussed. ■ Some
one pronounced the Greek word kuklos,
meaning circle. - :
From kuklos to kuldux was an easy
transition^-wboever consults a glossary,
of college boys' slang will not find it
strange— and klan followed kuldux as
naturally as "dumpty" follows "hump
ty." That the name meant nothing
whatever was a recommendation, and
one can fancy what sort of badinage
would have followed a suggestion that
in six years a committee of congress
would devote 13 volumes to the history
of .the movement. that began in a Pu
laski law office and migrated Inter to a
deserted and half ruined house on the
outskirts of the village. — Atlantic

Mr. Beddard of the London Zoologi
cal society calls attention to a pecul
iarity of the ears of tigers which he
thinks may be classed under the bead
of "protective markings." On the back
of each ear is a very bright white spot,
and when the cars are directed for
ward these spots are conspicuous from
the front Mr. Beddard suggests that
when the tiger Is sleeping in the dim
light of a cave or thicket the spots on
its ears may appear to an enemy, look
ing in, as the gleam of its watchful
eyes, and thus save the sleeper from an
unexpected attack.

Ten Cents Per Copy.
THE HONEYBEE.
It* Carious Jaws and IU Woaaerfml
Little Tougae.
With the closest scrutiny It becomes
evident that the bee does not, like
other creatures, house Its tongue In its
month, but neatly folds it back beneath
its head. Bumblebees, when disturb
ed, have a way of threatening with
their Jaws, while the honeybee -has
the more direct method of settling in
truders with her sting.
The Jaws cf the bee are -very credit
able organs and can give quite- a for
midable nip. . Catch a bee In a net and
see how viciously It will bite at the
meshes, working Its Jaws sideways in
stead of up and down.
We call this wonderful implement of
the bee a tongue, but In reality it is >
more than this, for the whole arrange
ment consists of two slender filaments
called maxillae, the under Up and the
actual tongue. If a drop of honey lies I
near the surface, of a flower, the slen
der, active tongue, darting out from
the case formed by the maxillae, licks
it up with the same ease that a dog
licks a plate. Should the tube of, the
flower be elongated the bee has' at
command another length of tongue,
which Is shot out from within and
shuts up like a telescope when no
longer wanted.
To appreciate fully this . delicate
organ you should watch the bee sepa
rate It Into Its component parts -and
clean It out. Tbe lengthening process
of the proboscis, as the tongue and Its
allied parts are sometimes called, la
accomplished by a series of springs and
hinges. In addition to this telescoping
power, the. tongue Is a hairy member,
the hairs arranged in rings, the longest
ones toward the center. They assist In
lifting In the nectar and In pumping it
into the mouth. Thence It goes to the
honey sack.— Chautauquan.

An Undesirable Boarder.

Ing houHe retired from business after
having acquired a comfortable com

During that period her house became
well known hi the city and among the

herself.' '- ; \V- - >: : : ;

been through the same experience sev

that she was not wanted In the estab

reputation for keeping a fine boose was
too much for the other women,, who
did not want to submit to the scrutiny
of a former boarding bouse keeper who
bad made a reputation and a fortune In
the business. ■ ' ' '
She learned, after going to a botel
where her record could not be used
against her, that she was not the only

NOT ACCORDING TO THE
BOOKS.
The Amador Record of last week,
in an articlo advocating the in
corporation of Sutter Creek, says:
It may be news to many of our
I readers to know that the townsite of
Sutter Creek embraces more tax
able property than almost any town
of the same inhabitants in Cali
fornia. We have double the prop
erty valuation Jackson had in her
proposed corporate limits and much
more than Sonora or Placerville —
incorporated towns of double the
population of Sutter Creek. The
reason of this is simple. Five min
ing properties in our townsite are
assessed for over $200,000. Having
double the value of property than
most, towns of our size, this in
itself is a strong argument in favor
of incorporation, for we could raise
the same amount of money as such
towns with one-half the rate.
; We do not propose to enter into a
discussion of the merits or demerits
of the incorporation question as far
as it relates to Sutter Creek. The
residents of that town are better
able to pass on the general proposi
tion than we are. We simply rise to
the point of order that Jackson,
either as a townsite or a school dis
trict, is not behind Sutter Creek in
taxable wealth. We do not desire
to detract in the least degree from
the wealth and importance of our
sister town. All we ask is that in
asserting its importance, due regard
be paid to Jackson, which is not only
the most populous but the wealthiest
town, acre for acre, in Amador coun
ty. Notwithstanding the fact
that Sutter Creek has $200,
000 worth of taxable mining prop
erty within its townsite, we venture
to say it still falls short of having
the heaviest tax roll of any town in
Amador county.
When the incorporation of Jackson
was under discussion some months
ago, the writer took occasion to
examine the assessment roll of Sut
ter Creek twenty five years ago—
when that town was trying to sup
port city airs. We found that the
amount of taxable property at that
time within its limits was between
$370,000 and $380,000. The Central
Eureka has developed into a divi
dend paying mine since then; the
town has also grown considerably.
We are not in a position to judge as
to the value of this additional prop
erty, but we think §100,000 would bo
a fair estimate.
But we have the official records
from which to get an accurate idea
of. .property valuations in Jackson
and Sutter Creek school districts.
Both districts are bonded, and hence
a segregation of the property in
each is made for assessment pur
poses. According to last year's as
sessment roll the valuation of these
districts was as follows:
Jackson $820,203
Sutter Creek 608,209
Jackson school district is probably
the most limited in area to be found
in the county, while Sutter Creek
district embraces a much larger ter
ritory. Fully two hundred thousand
dollars of mining property in Jack
son district falls outside the town
limits, beside much other property.
From this it will be seen, that al
though Jackson has nearly double
the population of Sutter Creek, the
property valuations are about equal,
owing to the fact that all the pro
ducing mines of Sutter Creek dis
trict' are within the town limits,
while those of Jackson district fall
outside the townsite.
We {lave RO m.eau* of, a6C?r
tainin^ the property valuation
of PlacervilJe. As to Sonora,
it was stated in a public meeting
beld in Jackson a few months ago,
on information yivon by one of the
trustees of that incorporated city,
that the taxable property amounted
to $900,000— just about double the
valuation that either Sutter Creek
or Jackson would have to draw from
in maintaining a local govornaieut.
So that Sutter Creek; on the score
of taxable wealth, falls a lonij way
short of being as well equipped for
the responsibilities of self-govern
ment as some other towns mention
ed, and which, from a brief experi
ence, begin to wish they had not
been so hasty in voting to incorpo
rate.
THE TAX LEVY.
The state tax rate has been fixed
by the state board of equalization at
48 cents on each $100. This is the
lowest rate for many years, being
1.8 cents less than last year's levy.
The rate for county purposes will
be fixed by the board of supervisors
at a special meeting to be held on
the 16th instant. From the fact
that the assessment roll of Amador
county for the current year has been
increased .to the tune of over two
hundred thousand dollars as com
pared with the figures of last year,
there is reasonable ground to look
for scne reduction in* the tax, levy.
The increase of property valuation
on the basis of last year's levy would
yield a revenue of nearly $5000 more
than we bad in 1900. With such a
handsome margin, in addition to the
lowering of the state tax, there
ought to be a substantial reduction
in the total tax levy for state and
county purposes. While such a result
might be looked . for under ordinary
conditions, there are exceptional
circumstances which seem to militate
against the hope of any material cur
tailment of the tax-collector's de
mands. The special road fund has
been heavily overdrawn. The sum
of $2000 was ordered transferred
this week from the current expense
funds U> meet the claims already al
lowed for work done this season on
the lone road. This money will
haye to be paid back when the
taxes for the current year arc col
lected. " A general election takes
place next year, and tbis always in
volves considerable extra expense.
Tt is really beyond tho power of the
board of supervisors to accomplish
much in the way of reducing the tax
rate under existing laws, however
much disposed they may be in that
direction, and at the same time deal
justly with the various interests of
the local government. The evils we
are suffering from are tho outgrowth
of many years of monkeying ,with
the laws for individual and political
benefit. When our road system is
placed on a sound business footing,
instead of its present political basis;
when tho fees collected by county
officials are readjusted ou lines more
in conformity with reason and a re
gard for the public interests; and
when the salary schedule is placed
on a more equitable footing, and the
tendency to boost them is stayed;
the taxpayers may then expect a
substantial reduction in the tax
levy, and not till then. If the
Republican administration will di
rect its energies not only toward the
utmost economy under present con
ditions consistent with efficiency, but
also urge such radical changes in the
laws as experience has shown to be
essential to a more equitable distri
bution of the burden of government,
it will earn the gratitude of the
people of Amador county generally,
and at the same time do much to
ward establishing republican ascen
dancy on a permanent footing.
GETTING INTO SHAPE.
As will be seeu from the receipts
published in another column, the
subscription list of the Ledger is
fast moving to a paid-up basis. We
believe there are few country week
lies in the state tliat can show a
larger pay-roll. We do not claim
this to be an average collection.
The sums received show that in some
instances four and five years have
been settled for, in some cases repre
senting a compromise for subscrip
tion dues extending over a much
longer period. It is a very easy
matter to get a large circulation by
sending the paper to any one. and
every one who will accept it as a
free gift. That policy is ruinous as
a business proposition. We believe
the Ledger to be worth its sub
scription price to every voter and
taxpayer in Amador county who
desires to keep posted on matters
pertaining to the local government, ;
and we shall adhere strictly to the
rule to send it to those only who
propose to pay for it either in cash
or its equivalent in services. As a
rule, our subscribers have been will
ing and anxious to settle their in
debtedness. That many of them
have run so far behind has been due
to neglect on the part of the Ledger
office in not making an effort to col
lect. Our collector, Mr. F. G. Head,
will visit all towns in the county
during the next few weeks, and we
trust our subscribers will continue
to show the same disposition to set
tle their indebtedness as they have
manifested in the past.

But the stream is always there, •
For the weary marks of travel to
defile you.' r

And ne'er had changed, nor wished

The nephew of deceased, Fred Werner
of Sutter Creek, recoived one-third of

and her children, in Germany, the
balance. The state university received
out of the legacies 5 per cent, or about
$1450, under the collateral inheritance
tax law. All tho property of the estate
was sold by the executor at good prices,
and the estate closed in ten months,

known in the superior court of this
county of an estate of over $10,000.

tbo earliest day allowed under the law.

expenditure receipts, all of which wero

Not Decided.
The Native Sons of Jackson are un
decided yet as to the erection of a hall.
They have several sites under con
sideration, among them being- Butter
field's planing mill. A meeting of the
Parlor was held Wednesday evening,
but no decisive action was taken. It is
not probable that anything will be
done toward building this year, as the
tirao is too short to admit of the erec
tion of a brick building before the
winter rains set in.
Hurt in a Runaway.
Two small boys, David and Phillip
Oates, sons of Wm. Oates of Bunker

feet when tho shafts struck a tree and
broke, releasing the boys; Phillip
was badly bruised and shaken up.

BLEW HIS HEAD OFF.
A Laborer Under the Influence of Brink,
Suicides in gutter Creek-
John Coombs, a laborer by occupa
tion, committed suicide in Allen's
lumber yard in Sutter Creek, on Sat
urday morning last, while in a state of
mental depression, brought on by in
dulgence in liquor. Coroner Gritton
held an inquest the same day, before
tho following jurors: V. Brignoli, E.
Shealor, P. H. Grady, Paul Guillani,
D. Tarr, C. H. Potter.
Only two witnesses were examined,
the evidence being conclusive that it
was a case of suicide.
H. R..Higgins, a clerk, stated that
he bad a talk with the deceased on the
morning of the 31st. He had left his
gun with him, but returned to get it;
also got a piece of string, and produced
a shell, remarking that he was going
to fix himself.. When he left the store,
he went toward Allen's lumber yard.
Higgins followed him a short distance,
and tried to persuade him to go back.
Coombs, however, told him to go back
and attend to his own business, or he
would kill him also. The witness re
turned to tho store, 'got on a horse a
few minutes thereafter, and followed.
He heard a shot, and proceeded to a
shed in the lumber yard, and found the
deceased lying there dead. A bottle
of wine was found on the wagon tongue
near by, which deceased did not have
when he left the store. The circum
stances showed that the deceased had
fastened a string to the trigger, placed
the muzzle of the gun to his head, and
discharged the weapon by pulling- the
string with his foot.
Joseph Dower testified that deceased
was bis stepson. He last saw him
alive on the evening of the 29th August.
He then made three attempts to end
his life by hanging himself. Deceased
was a 6ingle man, 30 years of age, and
a native of California.
The jury returned a verdict that de
ceased came to his death by a gunshot
wound in tho head, inflicted by his own
hand, while suffering from mental de
pression.
The remains were attended to by his
friends, and buried in the Sutter
Creek cemetery.
Only A Hat Pin.
A few days ago Dr. Lonigo was called
out to attend a man who was supposed
to have broken one of his ribs, and who
was suffering greatly. He had been
examined by somebody, who had used
the X Ray on him, and who advised
him to apply to a surgeon and have
the broken rib extracted. So he sent
for Dr. Lonigo, who found his patient
in great agony; in fact, the poor fel
low was in so much pain that he could
not be induced to sit still for examina
tion until he had been given a glass of
whiskey, which enabled him to be in
different to tho surroundings. Finally
the doctor, having his patient in the
desired position, and getting his surgi
cal instruments ready, proceeded to in
vestigate the broken rib. He found
his side somewhat inflamed, and con
cluded that no rib was broken, but
that something was wrong. So he
made an incision in the flesh, and with
his forceps ho brought forth, not a rib
nor a bone of any kind, but a real up
to-date hat pin, such as is used by
ladies in fastening the hat to their hair.
The pin was broken, and had evidently
been thrust into the side of the man
and then broken off. No doubt the
fellow will have a wholesome fear of
hat pins in the future, and will realize
that a hat pin, in the hands of a plucky
woman, is quite a formidable weapon
of defense.
Johnnie Kerr Injured.
Last Saturday three boys from Ama
dor City went to the country with a
four-horse team for a load of water
melons. The names of the boys were
Johnnie Kerr, aged about sixteen
years, Charles Pratt, and Harry
Taylor. On the return, young Kerr
went out on the tongue of the wagon,
between . the wheel-horses, to strike
one of the lead-horses which was not
keeping up with the others. After he
had succeeded in making the horse go
ahead all right, he stepped back along
the tongue to the wagon, but instead
of climbing back onto the seat, he
made a spring for the ground, and
caught his foot in the lines, which
threw him in front of the wheels and
the wagon passed over him, breaking
one arm and both legs. The latest
information received at the Ledger
office was that ho wa3 doing as well as
could be expected.
Successful Operetta.
The beautiful spectacular operetta
entitled "Golden Hair and The Three
Bears," in five scenes with a chorus of
30 voices under the direction of Mrs.
Carrie Clare last Friday and Saturday
evenings at Love hall, was a success,
and was witnessed by a fair sized audi
ence which, though not so large as it
should have been, was very appreci
ative. The singing of Miss Mac
Fontenrose and Mrs. Carrie Clare was
a feature that was well worth listening
to. The escape of Golden Hair (Miss
Amy Tuson) from the bears, relieved
the distress occasioned by her perilous
situation, and the end was as it should
bo, the wicked queen deposed, a new
king proclaimed, and the operetta
closed with stories of "long live the
king."
Notice-
The rector of the Episcopal church
desires to return many thanks to all
those who took bo great an Interest in
the operetta last week.

FROM ALASKA.
Cabin in the Wilderness, Ten Kiles From
Camp, Fifty-five Miles From Post-office.
Dear Lodger: —
At present wo, that is my brother
and I, are leading a somewhat retired
life. We are prospecting for gold in a
deep canyon of one of the tributaries of
the Chilcat, and enjoying the novelty
to its fullest extent. The mountains
are very steep, and generally covered
with timber and underbrush to the
height of sevoral thousand feet, above
which are snow, lava, rocks and
glaciers. Somo of the peaks are> over
12,000 feet in height. Wo have abund
ance of delicious berries, currants, fish,
and game. Peddlers and book agents
seldom molest us, and we have few
callers except bears and porcupines,
who are sometimes inquisitive, but
never obtrusive. We go to the town
of Porcupine, 10 miles distant, on Sat
urday, when the weekly mail is brought
up from Haines by a carrier, for which
wo each pay a dollar a month. Our
glorious government will not give ns a
post office, although it exacted more
than twenty-six hundred dollars ($2600)
in taxes from the people of the town
this year. The Canadians are taking
steps to get a post office at the edge of
town on the north side of the "movable
line," as the modus Vivendi provisional
boundary is called.
Have just seen the new map of
Canada.; It puts the line 30 miles
further south than they ever claimed
before, which will leave Skagway 20
miles ' inside the King's dominions.
British diplomacy has already driven
tho stars and stripes away from more
than two thousand square miles of rich
territory that we bought from Russia,
and this new claim will make the total
area, bulldozed from Uncle Sam,
greater than all the gold fields of Cali
fornia. The English flag was actually
hoisted in Skagway'a- few weeks ago,
but was promptly cut down by George
Miller, a brothor of Joaquin, the poet.
We are all wondering whether Ameri
cans must be kicked out of the rest of
Alaska, or will Uncle Sam finally show
a little of his old-time spirit.
This U a rich region, and the ground
is most profitably worked by the
hydraulic plan. There is a great
amount of wasteful and unskillful work
done. I have not seen an ounce of
quicksilver in camp, and only the
coarse gold is saved. The largest
nugget found this year was worth
$36.40.
I get the Ledger regularly, and note
with pleasure that tho old editorial
warhorse is again on the turf. While
often differing with you, I always re
spected your independence and fear
lessness. Expect to be here until about
Nov. Ist, and then go to California for
the winter. Hope to have the pleasure
of a set-to with the Jackson chess
champions before spring.

been afflicted with spasmodic asthma for tho past 12 years. Having exhausted
my own skill as well as many others, I chanced to see your sijiu upon your

My wife commenced taking it about the lirst of November. I very soon noticed
a radical improvement. . After using one bottle her Asthma has disappeared
and she is entirely free from all symptom*. I feel that I can consistently rec-
ommend the medicino to all who aro afflicted with this distressing disease."

A Beaver's Toilet.
It Is an Interesting sight to watch tbe
outlaw at his evening toilet. To begin
with, instead of sitting up with his
largo, flat, ' ribbed tail protruding be
hind iiiru, lie tucked it forward bstween
his hind legs and sat upon it. ; Then
with his hand he carefully combed his
long hair, using both hands at the same
time. There were many places, how
ever, that could not be reached in this
way; for bis arms are very short aud
his body very large, so he combed these
otherwise inaccessible places with his
hind ftet, using first one and then the
other. The entire operation was'per
formed wiHi the utmost deliberation
and caiii i.'.i occupied more than a
quarter of r.a hour, so that by the time
it was completed daylight .had almost
vanished.
My pre'st'cee did not appear to dis
turb him in the least, though 1 sat on
the ground within three feet of him
time I might the belter noto his various
attitudes, for It is not often ono has

The Military Salnte.
All Fnlutcs, from takiug off tbe hat
to presenting arms, originally Implied
respect or submission. Of military sa
lntk's, raisins the right baud to the
Isead is generally believed to have orig
inated from the days of the tourna
ment, when the knights. filed part the
throne of tbe queen of beauty and, by
way of compliment, raised their. hands
to their brows to imply that her beau
ty was too dazzling for unshaded eyes
to gaze upon.
The officer's salute with tbe sword
has n double meaning. ' The first posi
tion, with the hilt opposite the lips,
is a repetition 'of the crusader's action
in kissing the cross hilt of .his sword
in token of- faith and fealty, while low
ering the point afterward Implies ei
ther submission or friendship, meaning
In either case that It is no longer nec
essary to stand oa guard. Raising the
hand to the forehead has also been ex
plained as a sign that tbe weaponed
hand is empty and in an inoffensive po
sition, but this reason does not seem
so convincing as the. others ■'""'
Ancient Skyscrapers.
The idea prevails that skyscrapers
are of modern American origin, but
Professor Lancianl declares that in an

gustus, build logs 10 or 12 stories high
were common. Later they are believed
to have been much higher, rivaling our
most modern apartment building ;in
size and height. It is well known that
at Constantinople the Emperor Con
stantino found his view of, the water
cut off by tbe skyscrapers erected be

Pmins as a Model.
A curious feature of a model's occu
pation i 3 her posing for an artist who
is painting some one else. Wealthy
people are capricious and often do uot
care to give long sittings. Therefore,
after the artist has caught the expres
sion of tbe face, he will call in a model
to pese for the figure. Some models
<Io not care to do this, as part of their
enjoyment of their occupation consists
in seeing . themselves reproduced cv
canvas, but there are others who are
luite willing to help fill out.
Various incdels have various points
of excellence, and often a painter will
employ at different stages in the prog
ress of Ills work from three to four
models for oue figure on his canvas.
Oue model is known for her coloring,
another for her hands, another for her
hair. An artist generally notes in his
address book the characteristics of a
model after her name. These quota
tions are taken at random from an
artist's address book: - "Fine young
Jewess," "English, tall and slim, blond,
costume;" "Good back," "Good figure,
short legs, ivory tone."— Cosmopolitan.
Shoving the Queer.
The game of counterfeiting in this
country Is played by people of all na
tionalities, and, although some women
and children are used as tools, men
take the principal parts. After having
made the coin the great problem Is bow
to convert it into good money. The
maker rarely takes part in that opera
tion. It is the business of gangs, which
consist usually of two persons, known
as the ."holder" and the "shover."
The holder carries a stock of the
counterfeit money, and the shover has
oue piece. This La takes to a store or a
saloon and buys something for a small
amount, and when he comes Into the
street the holder sees him from his po
sition a. block away, joins him, receives
the good money and hands him another
counterfeit. .;.-. •• ■ - - . : .
The object is to work so that the
shover, if detected, may plead Inno
cence and prove that the piece is the
only one that ho has and that be has no
other money. Some clever operators
go so far as to mix good coin with the
bad.
To Gauge Bin Wife's Temper.
"I heard about a peculiar case of ben
pecked husband recently," said a young
woman the other day.
"What was it?" her friend inquired.
"There is a man who has some diffi
culty in gauging his wife's temper. At
times she is considerate of his welfare
and at other times— well, . he rather
thinks that married life is a failure.
"He has a peculiar manner of finding
out the state of his wife's feeling to
ward him. In the evening when he re
turns home from work he never steps
into the house without going through a
sort of ceremony. First he throws hi 3
hat in the house, and then be -seats
himself on -ie steps and waits.. If five
minutes pi ? without the hat being
thrown out again, he enters and gener
ally finds his wife very agreeable.
However, f the hat is thrown out
again the unfortunate man seeks hos
pitality for the night somewhere else
rather than brave the anger of his help
meet."—Cleveland Leader. '

TALK OF MARRIAGE.

If a man wants to marry, he can mar

Swallowed Two Pounds of Stone.
Stones do not form part of the rec
ognized diet of tbe cormorant, but on«
of these birds in the National Zoolog
ical park in Washington had a craving
which could be satisfied only by eat
ing two pounds of stones. The keep
er's attention was attracted to the bird
because after having once sat dowi
it couldn't get up. He was picked up,
and then the stones were heard rattling
Inside of him. An official connected
with the park decided that something
must be dene, and he promptly cut th<
cormorant open and relieved him of his
burden. One of the stones, of irregulai
shape, was SVs Inches long. Tho In
cision was sewed up, and for five dayt
*the bird got along all right, the -wound
healing finely, but at the end of thai
time the cormorant grew restive and
pulled out the stitches with bis booked
bill. As a consequence of opening up
the wound he died.
Artificial Stone.
Quarrymen and stone, dressers will
probably.be gradually cro\rded out of
their occupation by the use of artificial
stone. In the manufacture of this stone
the sand is heated and the cement add
ed to the amount of 12 per cent of the
mixture. The steel molds are j filled
with the dry. material and moved Into
on immense cylinder, which Is closed
and bolted. Boiling water is then
turned in under pressure sufficient to
force it all through the sand In the
molds. The cement slacks, but the
steel molds do not permit any expan
sion to occur, and the stone Is formed
and dried under an immense pressure.
The result is a very hard stone, which
can be supplied In shapes desired and
much cheaper than the natural stone.
