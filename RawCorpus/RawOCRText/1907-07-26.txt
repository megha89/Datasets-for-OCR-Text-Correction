Tree-Growth in Grass.— Science as a
Hobby.— Stellar Tin.— Canse3 ot
File.— Solid Building Foundations.
—London's Smoke.— Plating With
Cadmium. — Suggestion in Skin
Disease.— Antimony Painting.
The effect of grass on tree growth
has been studied in England, at tbe
Woburn Experimental Farm, for
seventeen years. Spencer Pickering
reports that in general various grasses
retard tbe growth of Uuit and otrmi
trees over whose roots they may be
growing, and in the case of freshly
planted trees the action is decidedly
injurious or even fatal. Experiment
has shown that the effect cannot be
due to abstraction of food or moisture
from the soil, nor to influence on soil
temperature or on the gases contain
ed, nor to tbe formation of acid or
clkali. Some poison produced by the
grass— directly or through bacteria
may affect the tree root", but tbe
latest experiments make it appear that
tbe real influence is due to tbe kill
ing by tbe grass of tbe root bacteria
that in some way promote the tree
growth. The roots seem to owe their
function to bacteria action— a con
clusion of great and tar-reacbing
aignitlcance, if verified.
Vary tbe routine of daily labor by
cultivating a scientific bobby, is tne
advice of Prof. S. P. Thompson, who
reminds us that much of the world's
scientific work bas been done by
amateurs. For instance William Hei -
scbell, tbe astronomer, was a music
teacher; William Oibbert, author of
L)e Magnete, was a medical man, Dr.
W. H. DalJioger, authority on the
microscope, was a clergyman; ana
William Sturgeon, inventor of the
electromagnet, was a shoemaker.
Observations of the spectrum of
Alpha Scorpii made at tbe Cape of
Good Hope, have shown a puzzling
line that an English astronomer has
attributed to tin. If this proves to
be correct, it is the first discovery of
tin ever made in the atmosphere of a
star.
Keturns by tbe London Fire Brigade
show that tbe careless practice ot
dropping matches and other lights is
tbe most prolific source of conflagra
tions, more than 21 per cent of the
3843 tires which ocourred in tbe
county of London last year having
been due to this cause. Not less than
257 fires arose from unprotected
lights, 148 from oil lamps, 67 trom
improperly set up stoves, 98 from hot,
ashes, and 235 from sparks from
grates. Gas leaks and tbe reckless
search tor tbem with lights resulted
in 131 fires. Defective wiring for
electric circuits led to 100 fires, some
ot them quite disastrous, but it is
believed that tbe new regulations and
safeguards urged upon architects by
electrical engineers will make quite
safe sucb wires as may j be placed in
future.
The "compressor" method of mak
ing foundations, which bas been
under test for six or seven rears in
Paris, consists in forcing a tapering
ram down to hard pan and then
ramming into the hole successive
layers of stones and rubble. 'The pro
cess thus forms a solid conglomerate
pile of tbe shape of an inverted mush
room, with a base four to six feet in
diameter. For ordinary foundations
one sucb pile takes tbe place of five
•ji six wooden ones, and it will sup
port an enormous load without sink
ing or collapsing. In wet earth, day
is introduced around tbe hole to make
the sides water-tight.
Half of tbe smoke cloud that tbe
London County Council is trying to
suppress is believed to bo due to tbe
ordinary domestic grate. In winter
on days when most business places
have been closed— tbe smoke of a
million domestic chimneys has been
seen to rise in a solid bank 3000 or
1000 feet and drift with the wind to a
distance of 50 miles in such density
as to hide tbe sun. Dr. Shaw's esti
mate is that one-half of London's
sunshine is cut off by smoke in
winter and one-sixth in summer.
The difficulties of electroplating
with cadmium have been recently
overcome, thus opening up an
important use for the metal, which is
now obtainable at a moderate price.
Tbe best results have been obtained
from specially prepared cadmium
carbonate, carefully purified, although
tbe commercial salt has Droven fairly
satisfactory, i'tie oadmium carbonate
is dissolved in a solution of potassium
cyanide, forming a clear, bright
yellow plating bath, and a cadmium
plate is used for tbe anode. A per
lect deposit is had with eitber a hot
or a cold bath, a temperature ot about
125 degrees F. being preferred. Tbe
coating, though soft, is harder than
silver, and the color is as white as
tin, but not so white as silver. The
surface, which takes a very high
polish is not readily tarnished by
sulphuretted hydrogen or other
vapors.
One of tbe surprises of the time is
the conservatism of medical science
in leaving chiefly to charlatans and
imposters such powerful healing
agents as electricity and mental
effort. A German , report mentions
tbe remarkable experience of Dr. Yon
Szoelloesy with a case of multiple
neurotio gangrene of the skin in a
young woman aged twenty. An ulcer
on tbe baok of the left band had

recent ulcers were present on tbe

suggestion while the patient was in a
hypnotic sleep.
Antimony pigments are being favor

Reports on City Ownership.
The investigation of public owner
ship of public utilities in Europe and
this countiy by the National Civic
Federation's commission bas resulted
in two reports, one by Prof. John K.
Commons of Wisconsin University
favorable to tbe proposition and the
other by J. W. Sullivan of the Cloth
ing Trades Bulletin disapproving.
Prof. Commons says they found tbe
privately owned utilities in England
dividing surplus for civio better
ments because of tbe prevailing tend
ency toward public ownership and its
example in cities where it had been
adopted. Many have shrewdly ar
ranged copartnership plans and bave
recognized tbe labor unions. He is
oonvinced that the recognition of the
unions is tbe safeguard against polit
ical corruption in public ownership
and tbat private ownership otters no
escape from politics.
Editor Sullivan says that in all but
tbe most poorly paid forms of laboi
public ownership has not raised or
improved conditions of work. He
contends tbat in England no street
car business bas ever been a private
enterprise, in the sense that tbe word
is used in this country, thus making
comparison with American conditions
unfair. Taking Syracuse, Allegheny
and Wheeling as tbe best samples of
American municipalization ottered.
they found conclusive evidence of
political rottenness in each case. lie
regards it as "a project to restrict
men in tbeir activities by methods
foreign to tbe American genius."

Final proof though technically
complete, is not always received.
Kuady -made proof submitted before

BABYLONIAN LETTERS.
All deductions made, however,
these epistolary records of the age of
tbe Jewish exile are well worth read
ing, says the London Saturday Re
view. They serve to enforce the
lesson that human life is much the
same at all times and 'in all places,
provided it is led in a civilized com
munity. Human wants aed even the
expression of tbem do not vary much.
the letters, like all others in tbe
caueiform script, were written on
clay tablets, wbich were inclosed in a
day envelope bearing the address.
There were already complaints that
work was insufficiently paid. A
brewer, for instance, writes to say
that "after 1 have made forty -one
cases of 1-year-old beer and twelve
cases of old beer in four months in
the cellar adjoining tbat of Kimut-
Bau, onemana of silver is too little."
Another writer protests: "In the
matter ot the money which my father
has sent, tbe money which has been
paid for tbe dates is too little. Let
my father speedily send two manas of
silver in addition, or 1 shall gain
nothing on tbe transaction." Ihe
workmen were frequently paid in
kind; sometimes, however, a lump
sum of money was paid down, out of
whioh the artisan was expected to find
bis own tood. One letter oasts a
rather lurid light on tbe relations
between the employers and employed.
The writer states tbat a workman had
gone blind, and tbat consequently
his pay must be stopped and his place
taken by some one else. Between tbe
atate of society reflected in this letter
and the workmen's compensation bill
tbe distance is considerable. In
another letter we are told tbat a
strike is threatening, and for the very
efficient, but very oriental, reason
tbat tbe workmen bad not received
tbeir pay. 'Ail tbe stonemasons," it
is said, have been uttering discon
tent, saying. 'He oppresses us; none
gives us our pay for tbe months Sivun
or Tammuz, ' Let my Lord command
that they be paid, for they are grow
ing very threatening. "
Ladies, as might be supposed, ap
pear among the correspondents. One
of tbem was .a careful housewife who
impresses upon her husband to "put
tbe meat which bas been scut you
into salt; but if you are not ready to
do so give it to Nazir, after tbe ninth
day." Another is equally character
istic. Why, pray, am 1 and my
daughters to pass tbe time thirsting
tor a letter from you? Now gather
your wits together and then, by
Samas, observe! Why, pray, has Uul
uballit taken away all my dates?
When I spoke to Bel-upahbtr about
it he answeied, 'See, your dates be
long to Bel-üballit, but Bel-nballit
bas not given me back a single one.
When 1 told tbem tbat the dates were
oar own product* they said to me,
'(Jet you gone and speak to tbe son of
Dakura about it.' When 1 spoke to
them a second time they said, 'Go
away and call on the gods."
Some Editorial Difficulties.
President Koosevelt, In his James
town speech, advised the newspaper
editors of the country to be temperate
in their expressions.
The temperate expression is a fine
ttnng, we admit,
And the sanctum's always better for
a wholesome lot of it;
But suppose some gentle poetess of
forty years or more
Brings in her latest poems and sits
down and reads them o'er?
And suppose some old subscriber
brings a column letter in,
And in trying to unroll it you are
skewered with a pin?
Pleae tell us, Mr President, among
such dreud killjoys,
Just bow is any editor to Keep his
mental poise?
Suppose a cub reporter has stirred up
the office ire
By falling down completely on the
story of a tire?
Or some compositor has knocked an
article sky high
By carefully inserting there a line of
printer's "pi"?
Suppose a wreck or war breaks loose
and photo there ie not —
The editor's "official" was not there
with bis gun.
While his bated rival's picture man
was Johnny-on-the-Spot —
How's an editor to bold himself from
writing things red hot?
Suppose the umpire from our team
hat stolen one whole game,
And the sporting editor sits down to
call that ump a name;
Do you think he's going to seek a
term of mild and soft reproof,
Or will he jump upon the man with
spikes in verbal hoof?
But these are just a few small things
that drive the press man wild;
i'here are others where it can't be
hoped he'll draw his language
mild.
But still, to words intemperate he'll
strive ne'er to give vent,
And he as mild a ciitic as— well, cay
our president!

From Our Exchanges
At the time of bis death, in Febru
ary, 1906, Antonio Chiohizola, a
large property holder in tbe North
End and in Chinatown, was reputed
to have left an estate valued at about
8700,000. Ihe fire occurred, however,
before the settlement of his estate,
wbich was placed under the scrutiny
of appraisers, who yesterday filed
their Inventory with tbe superior
court. Aooording to this inventory,
tbe value of the Chichizola estate bas
shrunk since the tire ot 1906 to 5157,
505, consisting principally of stocks,
bonds and real estate. It is reported
that the improved property burned
was but partially insured, and much
ol the insurance was placed with
welching companies.— S. F. Chronicle.
J. Newman has decided to retire
from tbe mercantile business in

that be can do better for himself and
tbe community by branching out
more extensively in that line.— Echo.
We learn with regret that tbe
famous Sheep Hanob mine bas closed
down, and present indications are
that tbe suspension will be for an
indefiuato period. Financial difficul
ties are at the bottom of tbe suspens
ion, and several attachments hnvu
been placed on the property. This
mine, though a small one has been
one of the famous producers of the
world. For about forty years it bas
been a producer, and bas paid from
tbe "grass roots" down. It is said
to have had tbe longest pay shoot of
any known mine. i'hongb the vein
was never wide, the rook was always
exoeediugly rich, thousands of
pounds ot tbe rook sold at its weight
in gold for specimens. Another
peculiar feature of tbe mine is, that
no true extension bas ever been found
at eitber end. The closing of this
mine will be a severe blow to Sheep
Kaocb, as it was tbe main dependence
of tbe town. We understand that tbe
pumps nave been taken out of tbe
mine, and if that is tbe case it is
doubtful if the mine ever starts again.

A Bee Special dated Fallou, Nev.,
July 22.— Because his sick wife re
fused to get out of bed and cook him
his breakfast on Friday morning, Ben
Davis, a local saloon man, pulled her
from tbe bed by the hair and beat her
until both her eyes were closed. Her
mouth was cut and bleeding and her
body was a mass ot bruises and cuts.
Tbe unfortunate woman weighs only
lUU pounds and has been ill for
several days. She begged with her
husband for mercy, but the infuriated
man whipped her until she was unable
to plead with him. She then crawled
under a bed and endeavored to avoid
his blows but be grabbed her by tbe
hair and pulling her out into tbe floor
began to kick her bead and shoulders.
Tbe neigbbors heard the woman's
moans and cries and ran to tbe house
while Davis was standing over her
about to deliver another kick. He
was immediately arrested and taken
to jail and Dr. Uasoall dressed tbe

lond Union High School.
Correspondence.
It seems that tbe only thing that at
present claims the attention of every
tbinking man, woman and child ol
Amador county, is the controversy
in tbe matter of tbe lone Union High
School.
Will it survive or perish? That is
tbe question. What is the reason
that the districts composing the
Union district became dissatisfied so
quickly with tbbir school? Time
alone will anwser the first question,
but if some of us who have studied
the question of high schools were
permitted to answer that question,
our answer would be: Let it perish,
that a different and better institution
supported by tbe whole county may
be ereoted to take its place. Of wbich
more hereafter.
The sceond question is more easily
answered, in the first place tbe
burden of taxes imposed on tbe tax-
payers of tbe Union district was so
much in excess of what they were led
to believe it would be. This caused
in a measure by tbe efforts of tbe
trustees to pay tor an expensive
building and equipment in too short
a term of years, and by those same
trustees being too free to spend
money for labtatory expenses, which
should properly have been paid (as
elsewhere) by tbe students who use
the labratory supplies.
Mo tuition was charted at first to
outside students, and that imposed a
very unjust burden of snpport on tbe
taxpayers; for though each student
dues help to draw more money from
tbe state tor the school, yet if no
tuition is charged outsiders, amount
of state aid is not enough to counter
balance tbe extra expense. Tbe Union
district objected to "no tuition,"
and last term tbe other extreme was
inaugurated, "maximum tuition." A
happy medium would perhaps buve
been a better policy.
Again a high school such as was
established in lone is not the kind of
high school Amador county needs.
Why? Because it unfits rather than
fits tbe majority of its graduates for
ibe struggle of lite. There may be
one in one hundred probable high
school students of Amador county
who want to be fitted to enter tbe
Academic courses at tbe universities.
The other 99 will probably never
enter any other place of learning
after having completed tbe bigb
school course. Those 99 should be
ready to face tbe problems ot citizen
ship and of life when they complete
tbe high school course. What good
will a smattering of Latin do the boy
who wants to be a mining engineer,
a surveyor, an aesayer, book keeper,
stenographer, merchant, farmer, fruit
grower, stockman, banker or what
not.
It seems to me what we need here
is a commercial and polytechinc
county high school, centrally located;
built and equipped by tbe sale of
bonds bearing a low rate of interest
and running for a term of years sup
ported by a light tax on tbe 5%
million dollars worth of taxable

Business Moving Too Fast.
Chairman Gary of the United States
Steel Corporation, before sailing for
Europe, gave it as bis opinion that
there would be a falling oft in tbe
volumne of business during the
second halt of this year. One factor
in this condition, he said, was the
approach of tbe next piesidential
campaign, which always bad tbe
effect of curtailing orders. Another
point, he said, was that people bad
been doing too much business tor tbe
amount of money available, and that
railroads had found some difficulty in
scouring necessary capital. Tbe in
crease in the volume of money in tbe
world bud not kept pace with tbe
increase in the volume of business.
He bad seen signs, also, of a decrease
in tbe amount ot building activity,
and he thought that tbe numerous in
vestigations and exposures and radical
agitation of tbe last year or two bad
a tendency to make investors timid.
If violent agitation should continue
there would be more and more money
drawn out of productive employment.
Nevertheless, Judge Gary believed
that the exposure of financial corrup
tion would prove beneficial in tbe
end. A contraction in business
would not be wbolly'undesirable, be
concluded, as tbe country has been
going at too bigb speed, factor im
running over time that they might
fill their orders.

FOR EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT.
The crying need of Amador county
is efficient aud economical govern
meut. it is little use to talk about
attracting irnmigartiou thitherward
mtil we mend our ways in local
management. We must have govern
ment tor tbe people, not for a clique
and favored tew, otherwise our terri
tory is not likely to forge ahead as it
should do considering its natural
advantages. We have no hesitation
in saying we are not getting efficient
government. On tbe contrary, we
are gettiug wretchedly inefficient,
recklessly extravagant government.
The samples of misgnverument al
ready pointed out iv these columns
recently are conclusive proof of this
statement. If the abuses cited were
knowingly tolerated by tbe supervis
ing board, they constitute good
grounds for investigation by a grand
jury with a view of indicting tbe
officials responsible tberefor. If tbe
abuses have been going on without
the knowledge of officials who are
elected for tbe purpose of guarding
tbe people's interests in such matters,
they reveal a system of carelessness
uud inefficiency which is equally re
prehensible, aud demands judicial in
vestigation. Tbe Ledger is (irmly
committed to the task of doing what
it can to redeem this fair county from
the withering blight: ot misrule.
Whether the change comes speedily
or alter a protracted struggle, it
matters not to us. There will be no
final let-up to tbe pulicy until a
better state of affairs prevails in
local management. There is no
partisanship iv this fight. We can
not hope to prosper as a county un
less there is a reasonable share of
diligence and efficiency shown in the
conduct of public business.
Amador Style vs. Elsewhere
Last month the Ledger devoted
considerable space to discussing tbe
peculiarities of tbe system adopted in
tbis county in calling for and award
ing coutract for supplies of stationery
and printing for county officers, and
also to tbe absence of all contract
arrangements in regard to tbe main
items of stationery, such as record
books. We presented to our readers
some of the absurdities of the
stationery list as adopted for tbe
basis of tbe bidding for such sup
plies, and also tbe fact that after the
contract was let it was of little prac
tical vali c in regulating the prices.
In other words, tbe thing was so fixed
up that it mystified instead of clari
fied the subject. In striking contrast
with the method that by some process
to us unknown bas crept into Amador
county affairs, we are now able to
pieient a list of prices adopted in
Monterey county for ordinary station
ary supplies, as awarded to the lowest
bidder. The people of Amador
county can see tbe difference. We
simply compare at tbis time tbe one
item of paper, as space forbids us to
print and comment upon tbe entire
list at this time. The Monterey
fchedule is clear-cut; there is no
deadweight tor ulterior purposes at
tached to it. On the other hand tbe
Amador list is absurd upon its face;
impossible of being carried into
actual practice. The Monterey list of
paper supplies ia as follows.
Willamette legal cap, plain or
numbered, any weight, ream - 82.00
Back parchment cap, per ream - 2.00
Golden Gate cap, per ream - 1.50
Letter tablets, 100 sheets, each - 0.15
Manila. 100 sheets - - - 0.15
Blotting paper, per pound - 0.10
The Amador list comprising such
supplies reads as follows:
No. 1 best quality legal oap,
16 lbs per ream, Royal Mills - 82.60
No. 1 best quality foolscap,
16 lbs, per ream - - - 0.90
No. 1 best quality bill cap,
16 lbs., per ream - - 0.65
No. 2 legal cap, 16 lbs., per ream 0.12
No. 2 foolscap, 16 lbs., per ream 0.12
No. 2 bill cap, 16 lbs., per ream 0.12
No. 1 best quality letter cap,
12 lb?., per ream - - 1.10
No. 2 letter cap, best quality',
12 lbs., per ream - - - 0.09
No. 1 best quality note paper,
5 lbs., per ream - - - 0.09
No. 2 note paper, 5 lbs., per ream 0.07
Manila legal tablets, 7%x12^,
Blaokstone, per doz - - 1.40
Blotting paper, sheets 19x24,
extra heavy, 120 lbs., per ream 1.7u
l.'o tbe uninitiated tbe Amador list
may seem mucb the more advantage
ous to tbe taxpayers than tbe other
schedule. But those who understand
such things, will say differently.
The Monterey list is simply based on
articles that are culled for, and in
quautites that, are actually needed.
There is nothing of tbe "No. 2 best
quality 16 lbs. " about it — meaningless
expressions used in suoh connection.
Sunh supplies cannot be had, lor they
are not made. So the tbreo items
(ailed for are legal cap at 32.60,
against 82 for tbe Monterey schedule.
Manila tablets, 150 each for Monterey
and 31.40 per dozen for Amador, a
slight difference in favor of the
latter. But tbe blotting paper item
sbow3 tbe difference in the motives of
tbe two lists. Monterey calls for 10
cents per pound, and doubtless orders
by the pouud. That ia the Way paper

of all kinds is sold by the manu
facturers. TSut Amador county cafls
for bids by the roam, and gets & rate
ot 51. 75 per ream of 120 Its. Now we
venture to say there never bas been
a ream of blotting paper, full sheets,
delivered to uuy one house in tbe
history of Amador county. So in
stead of ordering in ream lots, at
31.75 per ream the county gets blotters
by the dozen, cut up into ordinary
size, and charges at the rate ot $65
per ream, 01 over 50 cents per pound.
We will in a future is3ue coutinue
the comparison of enumerated articles
and rates, aud demonstrate that all
through tbe list the same discrepancy
against Amador is iv evidence. We
close tbis by remarking, that who
ever is responsible for originating tbe
schedule list in Amador county ought
to be awarded a medal as tbe cbampi
ou boodwinker in his special Hue in
the country. We venture to say, there
is nothing that will begin to compare
with it in this or any other county in
tbe United States. And for a little
county like Amador that is saying a
good deal.
County Telephone Bills.
A A bill was allowed at the last meet
iing of the board of supervisors in
f favor of the telephone company for
5 32.80, representing the cost of tele-
p phoning . by the county officials
l located in the court house and hall
o of records tor the month of June. It
d does not represent the total cost of
t the phone business to the county as
a a tew scatteiing charges of this
c character are included in other
c claims from outside the county sent.
l lt may be interesting to Know how
t this telephone bill is distributed
a among the different offices. The com-
p pany presents an itemized bill of
c charges, complete in every particular,
a and hence it is an easy mutter to
s segregate the charges to the various
o offices.
In addition to the regular charge of
51. 50 for each phone, 7in all, making
a total of 810.50 per month, the June
bill figures out as follows:
School superintendent - 3 3.60
District attorney ... 4.95
'Sheriff 2.00
County recorder ... v.GO
Superior judge ... *i.45
Assessor ----- 1.25
Auditor and clerk - - - 4.05
Fixed charges - - - 10.5U
Total 82; i SO
It would be a noteworthy exception
to the rule, if a legislature tailed to
give a boost in some directiou to the
salaries or compensation of county
olliceis. The last legislatuie was
not an exception in this regard. At
tbe meeting of the board ot super
visors this month a bill was present
ed and allowed tpr tbe sum ot S3O, for
compensation of tbe county auditor
in preparing a report and necessary
data for the past six months in regard
to the monthly allowances foi
orphans, half orphans, and abandoned
children. This is tbe first bill of
this nature that bas been allowed,
and of oouise the people generally
will be glad to know tbe basis ot ihc
charge. The bill itself refers to Sec.
101)9 of the statutes of 1907, being a
part ot the new county government
bill. Turning to that section we
Uud it reads as follows:
4099.— it shall be and is hereby
made tbe duty of every county audi
tor iv tbe State of California to keep
all tbe books and necessary account?
with reference to payments made by
tbe county of which be is auditor for
minor orphans and half orphans, and
abandoned children, and to prepare
tbe necessary data and make out all
claims against tbe state for such pay
ments, and the board of supervisors
may allow tbe auditor a reasonable
compensation for performing the extra
duty herein provided.
According to tbis section it is not
mandatory upon tbe supervisors to
allow extra compensation for the
work named. Tbe fixed salary is
supposed to be tbe compensation iv
full for all services that aie or may
be hereafter required of the official.
The strict reading ot tbe new section
leaves it to the discretion of the
board of supervisors to allow a fair
compensation for the extra work.
But a more serious objection to the
allowance at this time arises fro.n
tbe constitutional provision, es
follows:
Sec. 1). The compensation of any
county, city, town, or muuicipal
officer shall not be increased after
bis election or during bis term of
office; nor shall tbe term ot any such
officer be extended beyond the period
for which be is elected or appointed.
Experience shows that even tbe
fundamental law is brushed aside
with little ceremony when the ques
tion of compensation is concerned.
The restraints in this directiou im
posed by the constitution do not
count for mucb. As it now stands, if
the action ot the supervisors is tbe
criterion for tbe future, the iutro
duction of this new provision amounts
to a permanent addition of sixty
dollars per year to the compensation
of the auditor in Amador county.

Amador County s Heavy Taxpayers.
In accordance with our usual cus
tom, no publish this week a list ol
taxpayers who are on the assessment
re II for 51000 au<l over. Tbis year ou
account of tbe many changes iv
valuations for assessment purposes
tbe list will have especial inteiest.
Of course it is not absolutely correct,
laud some property boldeis have pro
perty iv all townshios, and others
have mortgages as well as real estate.
!We have endeavored to get them all,
but no doubt some items have been
overlooked. it will be seen that tbe

the lion's share of the burden ot

Tbe passenger steamer Columbia
was crashed into by tbe steam
schooner San Pedro between midnight
and 1 o'clock Sunday morning oft
tbe Mendocino coast tbe former sink-
ing in ten minutes after being struck.
Both vessels seems to have been gointt
at full speed, notwithstanding a
dense fog prevailed at the time.
There were 219 souls aboard tbe
Columbia, and or these between 90
and 100 are reported lost. It was one
of tbe worst botrors of tbe sea that
has ever happened on tbe Pacific
coast. Captain Doran of tbe Colum-
bia went down with his vessel, blow-
ing signals of distress to tbe last in
the hope of thereby attracting passing
vessels to tbe rescue of tbe drowning
passengers. It is hardly possible, if
tbe rules governing coast navigation
were strictly followed, that sucb a
disaster could happen. One or other
of the vessels must have been out ot
her course. A strict investigation
will no daubt be field, and the blame
located.

Last Monday a horse belonging to

gaged in tbe hauling ot logs to the
sawmill on Tiger creek, was killed in
a singular manner. It was attached
to a loaded truck hauling logs on the
tramway up bill to tbe mill. Another
truck was a short distance further up
tbe grade. In some way this truck
got started on the down grade, and
bumped with fearful velocity against
the animal lower down, breaking its
legs, and inflioting other injuries that
it was deemed advisable to shoot it.

In looking over tbe bills allowed by

more caution in making out the

the disciepancy between the prices

not so glaring as before this matter

there is ample room for criticism,
and improvement. Negligence is still

TRAPPED A BEAR.
An Exciting Experience of Hunting
Party at Bear River.
The party of hunters who spent teu
days hunting and fishing in the
vicinity of bear river got baok from
their trip last Saturday. They report
one of the most exciting times in the
history of hunting in that region.
There were six in the party : John
Garbarini, Frank Voorbeis, Jack bar
ton, all of Jackson, E. G. Amick of
lone, Jas. Langdon of Sutter Creek,
and Fred Johnson of New Hope.
The spot selected for their camp
was at the bear river dam of the
Standard Electric Company— an ideal
place for angling and hunting It is
between forty and fifty miles from
Jaokson. Two men — Fred Otis and
Whiteman, are keepers cf the dam,
remaining winter and summer to look
after the company's interests.
> When the Jaokson party reached
there the snow in places was piled up
six or seven feet deep, but tbe warm
weather since has reduced it to the
liquid state.
Fishing was not as good as it might
be, although the boys caught plenty
for their own consumption. Some of
the trout captured weighed over two
pounds.
Amick, the lone representative,
carried off tbe honors of tbe trip.
He succeeded in shooting a couple of
deer, and the monarch of the forest—
a cinnamon bear— was corraled in big
trap, with tbe bait of bis furnishing.
The method adopted in capturing this
brute alive is worthy of extended ex
planation.
In preparing for this excursion,
Amick took tbe precaution of taking
with him an old horse. Arriving at
the hunting grouuds, this animal
was shot at a spot selected. Then a
powerful steel trap was brought into
play, it was fastened by means of a
chain to a long loose sapling, sonic
twenty feet in length. The trap itself
weighed sixty pounds, and with log
aud chain fully two hundred pounds.
It was provided with teeth, so that
when its jaws came together with a
snap, the spikes would bold with the
grip of a vise anything that came
within its grasp. Ihe approach was
tlxed up by means of logs placed in a
slanting position, so that bruin could
only get to the feast prepared for him
by stepping across the narrowest part
ot the V formed by these logs. On tbe
other side of tbe sticks was -secreted
the trap, carefully covered up with
brush and earth. It was designed
that the first paw that Mr bear placed
over tbe dead live would spring the
trap and cause tbe foot to be clamped
tightly by the trap, the attachments
of chain and log being intended to
impede his movements after capture.
Oa Saturday, July 13, fonr or five
days alter arranging the trap, Amick
and Garbarini repaired to the spot to
see how matters were progressing. It
was a mile aud a half distant from
tbe camp by the dam. before reach
ing the place, they heard the distress
ed_cries of bruin, bellowing like a
calf, and they were satisfied that tbe
decoy had worked to a charm. It
was shortly after day light that they
oatne up to him. He bad evidently
only been trapped a short time,
although considerably fagged out by
bis efforts to release himself from bis
novel attachments.
As soon as they realized the situa
tion, tbe two men hastened baok to
camp to get ropes and further help,
with the view of tailing him alive to
vamp. The boys at camp were all
astir when told the news, and repair
ed en masse to tbe scene to assist in
Ibe capture.
The animal had not traveled more
than a hundred feet from the point of
capture. The long stick had become
jammed against the trunk of a tree
so tbe brute was pretty well tied up
and exhausted by bis efforts to
escape. After several attempts, two
topes were attached — one to a fore
foot, the other to one of tbe hind
lugs. A strong man was assigned to
the charge of eaoh rope. Fred John
son assumed tbe front plaoe, and
Johnnie Garbarini took the hind
tether, by teasing him aud other
devices he was finally led into camp
alive and well. Occasionally he
would make a vicious lounge to reach
bia tormentors, but tbe men at tbe
ropes, together with the trap and log
him kept under fair control.
He was a big specimen of his tribe,
weighing about 350 pounds. He was
not in plump condition, having but
recently emerged from his winter
torpor. What to do with him after
getting him safely in camp was tbe
next question. It was useless to
think ot bringing him to town. It
was too big an undertaking, and bo
sides he would be only a soruco ol
trouble here as elsewhere. So it was
wisely determined to kill him. On
Wednesday of last week he was shot
at the camp on bear river. The boys
had lots ot bear meat, and brought
plenty tc distribute among their
friends. Amick, as the owner of the
trap, and tbe furnisher of the bait
that turned the trick, kept the hide
as a trophy of one ot the most re
markable hunting achievement in
Amador connty.

AN EXPLODED STORY.
Johnny Burke all right in Blair.
A foolish story was circulated here
to tbe effect that Johnny Burke, wbo
for some time was employed in tbe
Jackson Shoe Store, had gone insane
in Nevada, and was sent to tbe insane
asylum at Carson; that he made his
escape from that institution, and
wandered off into the desert aud had
not been heard of sinue, the supposi
tion being that he perished in the
sagebrush wastes. The story seems
to have started irom letters sent from
Nevada, but without any authentic
data upon which to base the reports
of disaster. He left here several
months ago, and went to Blair, a
bew mining camp in the Tonopab
country, and found employment in a
mine over which A. Nooe, formerly
ot the Oneida, was superintendent.
The tales of bis mental breakdown
came to tbe ears ot his relatives here
abouts. He is a nephew of Mrs Perry
Lepley, whose husband works at the
Kennedy. Mr Lepley was worried
over the tidings of evil, and deter
mined to find out tbe truth. Last
week he telegraphed to A. Nooe,
requesting him to answer by telegram
what be knew about the matter.
Last Saturday he received a dis
patch in reply, not from Nooe, but
form uurke himself, saying briefly
that he was alive and well, and that a
letter would follow by tbe next mail.
The letter came to band promptly,
and shows that there was not a shred
of truth in the whole story of in
sanity. The young man explains that
atter working in blair for some time,
he left that camp, aud proceeded to
Goldfield— supposed to be the Mecca
of the hosts of labor, where abund
ance of work at top notch wages i.
ready for all comers. He was sadly
disappointed, and found everything
overdone, with a dozen men waiting
to grab every job in sight. He next
went to Tonopab, and hoped to get
employment in some store. Places
of this kind were scarce. So finally
he drifted back to Blair, and at the
time of writing was waiting on table,
enjoying good health, and earning
better wages than he formerly got at
the mine, and not nearly such hard
toil. His many friends through Ama
dor will be pleased to hear of the
absolute denial of the alarming re
ports that were started concerning
him.
A Double Celebration on the Tapis.
Jaokson is threatened with a pletho
ra in tbe celebratoin line. The Native
Sons of Excelsior Parlor is taking
Bteps to celebrate admission day,
September 9. At the same time the
local miners' union is thinking of
celebrating labor day on the 2d ot
September. It is admitted on all
sides that it would be suicidal to
bave two demonstrations so close
together— the one would inevitably
interfere with the success of the
other, both sides have been canvass
ing for subscriptions during the week.
For the admission day affair the sum
promised amounts tv between 8500
and 8600. It is claimed that they
must have at least 8800 before they
would be justified in going ahead;
some olaim 81000 is necessary. It is
doubtful if the list can be swelled to
tbe minimum amount.
Ihe labor union folks have also
canvassed tbe Held. They have a
smaller amount on their list, but it
seems their ideas in the celebration
line are on a more moderate scale.
It is reported that they are resolved
to go ahead anyhow.
Why not both orders unite, and
have a joint celebration, sharing the
profits or losses as the case might be.
Was Jared Not Boxed
Dick Ramuzzotti a miner employed
at the South Eureka mine, while
holding a long iron pipe upright and
scraping tbe rust therefrom, accident
ally brought the pipe against a couple
of electric wires overhead, producing
a sboit circuit. The result was that
be received a shock which reminded
him abruptly that "something was
doing" above and to "look out
below." Although badly jarred he
will nut be "boxed" as- his injuries
are slight, but ha will not only look
out but also look up while working
around electric wires. — Amador

BASEBALL.
Professionals vs. Business Men.
Tbe attraction at the base ball
grounds of tbe Jackson Athletic club
last Sunday was a game between a
picked nine of professional men
against a team of tbe business men ot
this city. The same teams played a
game in May last, which resulted in
a draw. So this decisive contest was
arranged to determine the question
of supremacy. It was further an
nounced that a stake of 8100 a side
was dependent upon the result, also
a champagne supper. We cannot
vouch for tbe coin issue, but every
one within a reasonable distance of
Main street was made aware of the
faot that tbe champagne programme
was carried out to the letter during
tbe evening. The line-up of tbe
players was as follows:
business Men. Professionals.
M. W. Ford c C. P. Vicini
F. Valvo v E. E. Endioott
Paul f»oggi Ist b C. A. Herrick
Robt. 1. Kerr 2d b J. W. Caldwell
Vie Rocco 3d b A. M. Gall
Jos. Ratto ss C. W. Scbacht
Tony Prato If Henry llayden
G. Voorbeis cf J. t. Wilson
John Garbarini rf Wm. G. Snyder
Tbe attendance was not as large as
was expected, but the game was a
source of infinite amusement to both
onlo'jkers and players.
'The score was 31 to 17 in favor of
the professionals. it was a great
game all round, aud drew forth lots
of fun if not good playing.
In tbe evening victors and van
quished fraternized in having a good
time, with a banquet and champagne.
The roystering and jubilations were
continued for several hours, everyone
having a surfeit of merriment.
Card of Thanks.
To tbe many friends who so kindly
assisted us in our late bereavement,
we wish to extend our sincere thanks.

a weird'tale of crime.
A terrible story of crime comes
floating baok from Austria, involving
one who was well known throughout
this county, named George Gregovicb.
He waa known as "tall George,"
being one of the tallest men in the
county, lie stood 6 feet 4 inches.
He had worked in tbe Keystone,
Zeila and other mines of Amador for
tbe past twenty years, and might have
accumulated considerable money, but
for an inveterate habit of dabbling in
stocks. He bad a sister, so tbe story
goes, whu was married to a wealthy
Russian, and who was living in
Kussia. During the revolutionary
troubles of that distracted country,
this rich linssian was killed. Tbere
atfer the widow gent money to her
brother George, then in Jackson, for
him to return to bis native land,
bosnia, and visit bis sister in
Russia. .
With this Unaucial incentive, be
left here about six months ago, not
intending to return. Whether be
visited his sister in Russia we oannot
say. At any rate he got back to bis
oid home in a town called Paatovicb,
bosnia. Here his aged mother lired.
She was between 70 and 80 years old.
His tat her died many years ago.
George tell in love with a young
woman there, and they were engaged
to be married. The prospective bride
did not command the approval of tbe >
mother, so it is claimed.
Sam Savicb, wbo keeps a boarding
bouse on Broadway, was well ac
quainted with Gregovicb. A few days
ngo he received a paper printed in
New York id the Slavonian langnage,
which contained sn account of tbe
tragic climax of this love affair. He
informs ns that tbe paper stated that
on tbe 17th of Jane tbe mother, aa
George afterward explained it, made
some remarks about tbe girl which
greatly incensed Gregovicb. A quarrel
ensued, tbe upshot of which was that
Gregovicb got an nx with wbicb he
stiuok bis mother three blows on tbe
bead, killing her almost instantly.
The matricide at once surrendered
himself to tbe officers, and told tbe
story of tbe homicide. He is in jail
awaiting trial. It is not probable
that a trial will be necessary, as be
admits tbe awtul deed. Tbe indigna
tion of tbe people was such that the
matricide would have been torn to
pieces bad they been able to lay
hands on him when they first learned
of tbe tragedy. It is believed be will
be given lit« imprisonment, as tbe
death penalty is not favored in ttat
country.
Gregovicb was not considered a
man of violent passion by those best
acquainted with him in this county.
He is between 50 and 60 years of age.
It is said be bas a brother living in
this state.
We cannot say with certainty that
tbe slayer referred to in tbe paper ia
the surne man that left this county;
but the general belief among those
who were well acquainted with him
hero is that he is the man.

DISPERSING A MOB.
Efficacy of a Fire Hose or a Stout
Rawhide Whip.
"A good stout rawhide whip in the
hands of a policeman would be one of
the most effective riot breakers I can
readily think of," said a police inspect
or. "There Is nothing the average
crowd of roughs fear more than a raw
hide in the bands of an expert unless.
Indeed, it is a stream of water from a
fire hose. Before the stinging lashes
of a rawhide there is no crowd which
would not cringe and fade away. Then
where there are children in a mob a
cop does not want to nail one of
the little ones on tbe head with a
night stick. A crack of the whip
would be less cruel and quite as
effective. It is usually the sharp
crack of the lash that does the trick, as
much so as the sting. In Russia the
clout Is used with more deadly effect
than the rawhide or blacksnake whip
could ever be used. Of course there is
danger of putting out the eyes of some
one with tbe cracker of the whip, but
then, too, there Is danger of breaking
some heads when the night stick is ap
plied:
"Did you ever see a crack driver
from the rural district handle a long
whip? He has it down so flue that he
can flick a coin out of your fingers
twelve feet away. A policeman could
become equally proficient with prac
tice. It would be just the wrinkle in
many cases where there is a mob to
handle. A whip and a fire hose would
make a great battery. The fire in many
a rioter has b^en extinguished by the
cold stream from one of those two inch
nozzles."— New York Times.
Fear and the Hair.
That fear will cause the hair to stand
on end has been known through the
centuries, ever since a spirit passed be
fore the face of Job's comforter, Eli
phaz, the Temanite, and "the hair of
my flesh stood up." At the execution
of a horse steaier in 1825 the man's
spiritual attendant noticed that when
his bands were tied "his hair— long,
lanky, weak iron gray hair— arose
gradually and stood perfectly upright
and so remained for some short time
aud then as gradually fell down." Car
dinal Pacca saw Pius Vll.'s hair stand
erect from anger, and Eccleslasticus
records that "the talk of him that
sweareth much maketh the hair stand
npright."
A* Others Saw Him.
A day or-two ago it fell out that an
actor with a purpose was cinemato
graphed on the stage and was vastly
pleased with the result.
Said he gleefully to a prominent dra
matic critic, "It was the most extraor
dinary experience I ever went through
— actually to see myself acting."
"Now," said the prominent dramatic
critic, "you understand what we have
- to put up with."— Pall Mall Gazette.
Reached the Limit.
A Providence girl, who has been
married about six months, had wed
ding cards a short time ago from an
old school friend who had given her a
wedding present, which, of course, de
manded oue in return. Among her
welding presents the Providence girl
had duplicates in the shape of two sil
ver card trays, and in a spirit of econ
omy she decided to give one of these
to her friend. It was marked with her
own initials, but it would be ouly n
matter of a few minutes to have them
removed and the proper monogram cut.
She took it to the jeweler aud explain
ed what was to be done. He picked up
the tray, looked at it closely and
smiled.
"Madam," said he, "it will be im
possible. I have already changed tho
Initials on this same tray five times,
and it has worn so thin that I cannot
do it agaiu without cutting 1 through the
bottom."— Providence Journal.
His Fears Realized.
For years the old country couple had
looked forward to spending a holiday
in London, and one day they found
themselves In the very busiest part of
the city. Together they stood watch-
Ing the traffic, to which there seemed
no end. They did not know how to
cross the street.
"Whatever you do, Liza, don't git
separated from me," said the old man
to his wife, "and, whatever you do,
don't cross the road without me."
Then a kindly constable came along
and, seeing the old woman hesitating,
took her by the arm and commenced to
pilot her to the opposite side.
"Dang my buttons," cried out the
old man In alarm, "I allus told 'er that
some one wud take a fancy to 'er, but
I didn't think any one 'ud 'aye the im
perance to take 'er afore my very
eyes!"— London Tit-Bits.
Had a Slow but Sure Gait.
There have been numerous disap
pointments in the outcome of some of
the boys. We remember one boy in
particular who was the butt of all ridi
cule from the boys of his age, and he
took it good naturedly. He seemed to
have no particular friends and herded
by himself. His clothes always looked
funny, and he had that awkward swag
ger over which the rest of us had
much sport No one ever thought that
that plug would ever get anywhere or
have anything. But today tbat plug
is drawing a better salary than any
two of the old gang. He has more
money, more influence and more
friends than any of the rest of us. The
plug had a gait that was slow, but it
was sure. He didn't appear to be a bit
bright then, but he had a surface that
took on a polish.— Westphalia (Mo.)
Times.
Yet He Didn't Need Them.
He had been calling on a young lady
for many moons; but, being backward,
his suit progressed slowly. Finally she
decided it was up to her to start some
thing, so the next time he called she
pointed to the rose in his buttonhole
and said:
"I'll give you a kiss for that rose." A
large, open face blush meandered over
his countenance, but the exchange was
made. Then he grabbed his hat and
started to leave the room.
"Why, where are you going?" she
asked in surprise.
"To the— er— florist for more roses,"
he exclaimed.
Dangerous Ignorance.
If his son came to him and said, "I
want you to show me on a piece of pa
per how this house is drained and why
such traps are used," could the average
citizen satisfy that son? Of course he
could not. A. few might be able to do
so, but the average man Is an ignorant
person on all questions of hygiene.— G.

LIVING IN PARIS.
The Way One Rents an Apartment In
the French Capital.
An apartment should be .seen ou a
sunny day ljefore engaging, and it Is
not legally secured until papers are
signed. The lease is ou a quarterly
basis. Payments are made in advance
the 15th of January, April, June and
October and occupancy given up to
these dates. But when intending to
leave the tenant should give his three
months' notice before the first day of
these months. Failure to do this and
neglect cf the governmental tribute of
a stamped paper hold him to a further
three months' liability, as many a rue
ful American can Witness. To avoid
this it is merely needful to buy a
stamped sheet of paper for 8 cents of
the tobacconist, legal vender of all
Stamps, write the notice thereon and
give it to the landlord personally or
send it to him by registered letter.
The concierge, although he collects the
rent and has full charge of the house,
is neither authorized to let the apart
ment nor to receive notices. In the
paper signed by tenant and landlord
the former guarantees to return the
apartment In good condition, and if it
is freshly papered, painted and waxed
there will doubtless be something to
pay on leaving, but care and economy
in nail holes make the damages slight.

VENUS OF MILO.
The Famous Ancient Statue In the
Louvre at Paris.
The Venus of Milo In the Louvre.
Paris, ia supposed by some to be the
work of Alexandras, one of the Asiatic
Greek sculptors. It is said that tho
base of the statue bearing the artist*
name was destroyed lor the purpose of
causing the king of France to believe
tbat the work was more ancient than
it really was.
It was discovered ou the island of
Milo In 1820 by a peasant. It was in
a niche In a wall which had beeu
burled for years. The Marquis of Itl
vere bought it and gave it as a present
to Louis XVIII. of France. It is made
from two blocks of marble joined above
the drapery which envelops the less.
As it now stands It has two blemishes,
which have been repaired by modern
artists. The tip of the nose was bro
ken when it was found and also the
foot which projects beyond the dra
pery.
In point of fact, It has a great deal
more resemblance to a goddess than
to a beautiful woman. At one time it
was dressed in clothes of a modern
sort, and the effect was anything but
pleasing. The figure of the statue is
not at ail adapted to modern clothes.—

TKt'AIR BRAKE.
It Was Ushered Into Actual Use In
Most Dramatic Fashion.
The air brake was ushered into actu
al use in most dramatic fashion. The
trial trip occurred in April, ISCO. The
train selected was the Steubenville ac
commodation, running between Pitts
burg aud Steubenville, O.
When the train was going at full
speed, suddenly as he came around a
sharp curve the engineer saw a stalled
wagon in the middle of the track dead
ahead. With only hand brakes noth
ing could have prevented a terrible
smashup. The formal time for the
trial of the air brake had not come,
but the brake was there, and iv des
peration, not believing for a moment
that the thing could possibly avail, the
engineer threw on the air. But it did
avail.
The observers in the rear were al
most catapulted out of their seats by
the shock of the sudden stop. But
when they saw the engine fairly pok
ing Its nose into the wagon bed, so nar
row had been the margin between
safety and disaster, they forgot all
about their shock and stood iv awed
silence. The air brake had jeome into
its own. — Everybody's Magazine.
Keyhoid Tenure In London.
The curious custom of keyhoid ten
ure still prevails at Crowlaud, the fa
mous abbey town in the Lincolnshire
fens, where there are a number of cot
tages which are neither copyhold, free
hold nor leasehold. They were origi
nally built on waste laud, and in each
case the possessor of the key holds au
undisputed tenancy. Although some of
the occupiers have replaced the mud
and thatched dwellings of antiquity
with brick and slated buildings, they
have no power to sell or will them
away, for they have no deeds. On a
tenant dying the first person to cross
the threshold takes his place if he so
desires. Mauy devices have been re
sorted to to obtain the keys. The prop
erties carry a county vote, but the poor
law guardians always refuse to grant
relief to the tenants. — London Globe.
A Vegetable Freak.
California has one tree which is the
personification of mystery. Found no
where else in the world, it had n mys
terious origin and thrives in a region
of mystery. The Mojava yucca is a
vegetable freak which has developed
Into a species. It has the characteris
tics of several plants, to which no re
lationship can be traced. It is an ca
dogeu, yet its bark shows concentric
rings such as characterize the exogen
ous stems. It lives and thrives in
great numbers iv a region nearly de
void of vegetation.— P. E. Magazine.
Elephants.
People who really know nothing
about it used to say that elephants
never lie down to sleep. This is not
true at all, says one writer. They have
been known to stand for twelve
months without lying down to sleep.
This is regarded as want of confidence?
in their keepers and of longing to re
galu their liberty, for when they are
perfectly at ease and reconciled to
their fate they will lie down on their
shies and sleep peacefully.

Running Down a
Forger.
[Copyright, 1907, by P. C. Eastment.]
I was with Detective Hogan the day
he first saw the little widow Carson.
He had a case on in court, and she
was a witness for vthe defense. Her
testimony cleared his prisoner, al
though he had a good case, but he did
not hold it up against her, as would
have been natural.
For long weeks I kept tab on Hogan
as a citizen. He acted just as another
man would. His admiration for the
little widow impelled him to seek an
introduction. After that he was hard
hit. He became a frequent caller, and
in time we all came to know that he
was one of her suitors and the favored
one. It seemed funny that he aheuld
send her bouquets and don a dress suit
and accompany her to the theater.
One day I was surprised out of my
boots by the detective sitting down
with me aud giving me his confidence.
Dou't imagine It was about any offi
cial case. It was as a man that he
wanted to talk with me about being in
love with the widow. A very young
man or an old bachelor will often do
that. She. hadn't accepted him in so
many words, but he wns sure that his
love -was reciprocated. He was lov
ing her as a man, but he had sized her
up as a detective. From bis reading
of her character she was close upon
the "order of angelic. He had looked
for a Haw in vain. He was satisfied,
and more than satisfied, and naturally
he wanted all others to be so. I could
tell you here that I differed with him
in many respects, not orally, but men
tally, and thus make out that I was
possessed of superior acumen, but 1
am not posing in that direction. To
some one else I might have said my
say, but not to Hogan. He would have
been down on me at the first word.
The case in which the widow had
been a witness for the defense was
one of forgery. About the time Hogan
gave me his confidence three banks
were victimized the same day. Signa
tures of depositors were counterfeited
and over $3,000 hauled in. In each
case .the check was presented by a
woman, a fairly tall woman, wearing
glasses and supposed to be over mid
dle age. As her identity was vouched
for, the teller had to count out the
money. The case was given to Hoggn,
aud he took it up with the utmost
ardor and confidence. A week passed,
aud there were two more forgeries.
Then, a few days later, two or three
checks were kited. It was all done
by the same woman, aud yet Hogan
hadn't struck a clew. He was so hot
on the trail, however, that she changed
her tactics. She intrusted the checks
to an old man and raised $10,000 in a
day. "What's the matter with Ho
gau?" was being asked at headquar
ters; but, bestir himself as he would
aud did, he could not advance his case.
By forgery and check raising the gang
scooped in nearly $30,000, and not one
of them was spotted.
Then occurred what some of us call
ed a laughable thing and made merry
over. Hogan was a thrifty man. He
had saved money from his salary, and
he had speculated, aud his bank ac
count stood very close to $20,000. He
was a depositor at a state bank, and
one day the same old man presented a
check for $15,000 and drew out the
money. It was Hogan's signature as
plain as day, and he had not only
vouched for the signature of the oth
er, but had sent along a brief note.
The teller tried to reach him at head
quarters, but failed to get the con
nection, aud tbe check was paid. Two
hours later Hogan was roaring around
that bank like an angry lion. He had
been done for. It was only natural
that he should call on the widow that
evening to relate his loss, and, her
sympathies being aroused, the climax
came — that is, she leaned her head on
his stalwart shoulder and murmured
that she would be his. She was sorry
for his loss, but she had enough for
both.
Two evenings later he went up to
make sure of the date of the wedding
day, and she was out. He did not go
again for a week, being busy on his
case, and when he next appeared the
house was empty and had been for
several days. His petite fiancee had
fled. For a day or two the man fought
hard against the belief that he had
been duped. Then the man took a
back seat, and the detective came to
the front, and it did not take him long
to figure out things. The cute little
widow was no widow at all, but the
wife of an adventurer. She had been
an actress, and she knew all about
makeups. She had been driven to ev
ery bank in a carriage in shoes that
increased her natural height by six
Inches. Pencil and paint had put on
wrinkles and lines, and she had taken
care to dress for the occasion. Hogan
himself would not have known her on
tin' sn-pot. Her husband had been
just aa artfully disguised, and when
the ;.-oint of safety had been reached
(he iioid had been abandoned.
Tha thing must have come hard on
the man, but he was full of grit, and
lid braced up. He was given carte
!>l;i:icb.3 as to his movements for a
year, and h3 drew out the balance of
his money and crossed tho ocean ou a
trail he had picked up. For ten months
!:? fallowed tiio couple over Europe,

Medicine In Ancient Egypt.
There is much evidence in inscrip
tions and. manuscripts that the ancient
Egyptians practiced medicine and sur
gery extensively. Probably their prac
tice was based on little knowledge of
anatomy. Each physician treated only
one or two diseases. The sick were
exposed in public places so tbat others
who had suffered similarly might tell
them of helpful remedies. Diseases of
the eye were best understood and re
ceived both medical and surgical treat
ment. The most important medical
manuscript found in Egypt is the

In a Fog.
Nothing has such a bewildering ef
fect as fog. Only animals which find
their way by scent can get about in it
with any certainty. Birds are entirely
confused by it. Tame pigeons remain
all day motionless and half asleep, hud
dled up, either in or just outside their
pigeon houses. Chickens remain' mo
tionless for hours during heavy fogs.
No bird sings or utters a call, perhaps
because it fears to betray its where
abouts to an unseen foe. During one
very thick fog a blind man was found
wandering about a certain district Ot
tomlon. This man was in tile habit of
coming up every day from a suburb,
carrying notes and parcels, and had
scarcely ever lost his way before. Ask
ed why he had gone astray (for he was
quite blind, and It was supposed that
weather would have made no differ
ence), he said that in a fog the ground
"sountled quite differently." — Chums.
Entranced.
The happy couple dashed through the
showers of rice and old shoes and
reached the train.
"Oh, George," whispered the blushing
bride, "do you hear what they aie
shouting?"
"No," replied George, trying to loosen
a white ribbon that had been attached
to his silk hat. "What are they shout
ing?"
" They're off! They're off!' "
George smiled broadly as he helped
her aboard the parlor car.
"Oh, that's all right, my dear," he
assured. "All couples are a little off
when they are starting on their honey
moon."
And then began the rainbow tour per
sonally conducted by Hymen.— Chicago

THE ODOROUS ONION.
A Word or Two In Favor of the Pun-
gent Vegetable.
The onion need have no fears. Its
position is secure. Born of the lily
family, probably in Asia in the faroff
centuries, it grows all over the .world.
It was well known to the ancient
Greeks and Romans. It is mentioned
in ancient Egyptian writings and in
the Pentateuch. When the Israelites in
the wilderness grew weary of manna,
they sighed for the good things they
had left behind, and they distressed
Moses when they lifted their voices in
weeping and cried: "We remember the
fish which we did eat in Egypt freely,
the cucumbers and the melons and the
leeks and the onions and the garlic,
but now our soul is dried away. There
is nothing at all, besides this manna,
before our eyes." It was not so much
the fleshpote of Egypt that they sighed
for as the succulent leek, the pungent
onion, the odorous garlic. The onion
is the Welsh national emblem. In
Spain and Italy garlic, which is mere
ly a condensed onion, enters into near
ly all dishes of both the rich and poor.
The onion thrives in Siberia and in
Honduras. It flourishes on the Nile
and on the Mississippi. It was a fa
vorite with the Ptolemies of ancient
Egypt, and it finds favor with the
highest and the lowest hi Macon and
Charlotte. The lady of Shalott died
of a broken heart because she had to
give up either onions or her lover. Her
lover was one of those finicky fellows
who objected to the odor of onions,
and she would not give up the shallot
The onion is all right. It never seeks
to conceal Itself. It is about the only
thing in hash in which one can have
confidence.— Nashville American.
Poll Parrot a* a Game Bird.
While the parrot Is a bird of beauti
ful plumage, as a table deliciyy It Is
not to be recommended, as I know
from sad experience. My first essay at
eating a parrot was attended with mod
ified success. The bird must have been
comparatively young, and after several
hours' boiling became soft enough to
masticate and finally swallow, leaving
behind It an Impression tbat we had
lunched on the sole of a rubber boot. —
