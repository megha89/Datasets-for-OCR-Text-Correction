Amador and El Dorado Stockmen's
Association Holds an Interest*
Ing Meeting.
The annual meeting of tbo Amador
and El Dorado Stockmen's Associa
tion was held in tbe court tooni in
Jackson on Tuesday last. On account
of the weather, and the bad state of
the loads, tbe attendance was smaller

represented, but tbe memberß from Jiil
Dorado county failed to respond.
C. L. Culbert, president of the or
ganization, presided, and W. E. Finn
was secretary.
Officers for tbo ensuing year were
eleoted aa follows: President, C. Li.
Culbert; secretary, W. E. Finn;
treasurer, Geo. A. Kirkwood. An ad
visory board was appointed as fol
lows: John W. Joans ot lone, O. C.

A. Kirkwood.
Tbe chief ranger of the Tnlioe forest
reserve, in which Arnador and El
Dorado counties are situated, was
present at tbe meeting.
A general discussion concerning tbe
cattle interests was entered upon;
also in relation to tbe grazing ou tbe
government reserve. Applications
for permits to graze were made by
nearly all of those present who de
sired to have stock within the Tahoe
reserve. Those driving stock upon
Alpine public lands will have to
make application to tbe forest range*
at Gardenerville. Nov., as that coun
ty is included within the Mono
reserve.
.It was deoided to hold the next
annual meeting in Jackson on the

The Pure Food Law
Secretary Wilson Bays: "One of the
objeots of the law is to intorm tbe
consumer of . the presence <of certain
harmful drugs in medicines. " The
aw requires that the amount of
chloroform, opium, morpbioe, and
other habit forming drugs bo stated
ou the label of each bottle. The
manufacturers of Chamberlain's
Cough Kumody have always claimed
that their remedy did not contain
any of tbese drugs, and the truth of
this claim is now fully proven, as no
mention of them is made on the label.
This remedy not only one ot tbe
safest, but one of the best in uso for
coughs and colds. Its value has been
proven beyond question during the
mauy years it has been in general
use. For sale by Jackson Drug Store

Prisoners in Jail-
There are six prisoners confined in
the county jail. One was lodged
therein from lone last Monday to
serve a sentence of one bundled days
for misdemeanor. Another is Kiley
Aleck, tbe Indian, awaiting trial on
a charge ot beating his wife. Another
Jackson Dennis, who is charged with
embezzlement of tbe funds of the
Sutter Creek bank, and has been un
able to furnish the necessary bonds
for liia release on bail. Then there
Is tbe Italian who pulled" a gun on
'another' in a saloon just beyond
Amador City, who has been sentenced
to several months in tbe county jail
for simple assualt. ' Ibo other two are
A. Borello iiiui D. Manzo, who have
been tried and found guilty of arson
in connection with the burning of
tbe Summit hotel on Sutter hill, and
sentenced to imprisonment; in tbe
state prison. They are detained in
tho county jail on a writ of probable
cause, pending tbe result of an appeal
to' tho appellate court. It is over six
months since they were convicted,
and the commencement of the
sentence will not begiu until their
recoption in tbo state prison. So
that in tbe event of the judgment be
ing affirmed, they will lose all tbe
time they have been in tbe county
jail. It will take at leust six months
before a decision of the appellate
court is likely to rendered in these
cases, as statement ou appeal has yet
to be settled.

The Sacramento valley develop

colouista rates will be put into effect
thiß year. Daily during March and

will be sold to main lino points ou
the Soutborn I'ucillo m California
Kor instance, the into Irom Umuliu

This is 85 Jess than the colouists rtitos

apply on all tickets from all points in
the oast to California during this
period.
The large traots of good land whioh
are being subdivided and sold in the
Saorameuto Valley will need theso
settlers. The ooloniet tiokots sold to
tbo iSaorameuto vulle.v during 1008
was an increase over previous years,
although the aggrcgato of colonist
tickets sold to Ualitoruia probably
was not an largH us other years on

RAVAGED BY A WORM.
A Menace to Stockmen.
Stockmen In the valley section are
becoming alarmed on account of a
bug or worm that la attacking the
grass, materially interfering with the
capacity of the land for grazing pur
poses. Tbo matter waa a topic of
discussion nt the meeting of the
atockmen'a association held in Jack
son lost. Tuesday.The ravages of this
pest bave so far been confined to tbe
low lends of Jackson and lone valleys
bo fat hs Amador county is concern
ed. The same trouble is reported
from otber counties in the Saora
monto and San Joaquin valleys. It
ia said that a larue area has been do
vaatated by the peats to the serious de
triment of tbe grazing lands. It ia
thought to be a new Insect pest, not
encountered before, or at leaat to
such an extent aa to monace an im
portant industry. While the evil is
principally confined to tbe valley,
the bug is slowly invading ttie foot
hills, it has been met with as fat up
aa the mineral belt. On the Froelich
landa near Martell it has been
noticed. Keporta say it is similar m
appearance to an angle worm. Its
mode ot operation ia eating tbe grass,
or attacking the roota so as to greatly
diminish tbe crop. A specimen of
this bug was on exhibition at tbe
gathering of tbe stockmen this week.
So important is tbe subject deemed,
that tbe sample was left with C. L.
Culbert, tbe president. ot the associa
tion, so that it may be sent to
government experts in San Francisco
for critical examination, with a view
of determining the best method for
its extermination, it was forwarded
to the authorities this week, and a re
port may be looked for in the course
of two ur three weeks.
Stomach Trouble Cured
If you have any trouble with your
stomach you should take Chamber
lain's Stomach and liver tablets. Mr
J. P. Klote of Edina. Mo., says:
."1 have used a great many different
medicines for stomach trouble, but
find Chamberlain's stomach and liver
tablets more beneficial than any. other
remedy 1 have ever used" For sale by

Free From Smallpox Again,
Dr. Endicott, . county physician,
went over to Urytown on Tuesday,
and released from quarantine tbo last
of tbe smallpox pationts there. The
afflicted one was a boy named
Uonovao. It was one of the worst
cases that has developed in that sec
tion. All of those afflicted with the
complaint recovered speedily. There
is not a case of the disease in tbe
county at present, so l'nr'as the health
officer knows. Drytown was tbe last
place of refuge for this dread plague.
A number of cases occurred in that
village.
Keports are current that a newly
married couple from this county,
while on their wedding tour, got as
far as Sacramento, where tbo groom
was quarantined ou account of small
pox, tho eruptions having broken,
out after he got started on the honey
moon tour. We have not been able
to verity the report. Tbe incident
shows the mild character of this once
fearful plaguo. Often the stricken
one moves about as usual, suffers not
in the least, at the same time carry
ing the unmistakable pustules that in
variably accompauy the fully de
veloped disease.
Prehistoric Vegetation.
On the Uaribuldi gravel claim near
Volcano, at a depth ut nearly III) feet,
they came across the trunk ot a tree,
and otbar remnants of vegetation of
prehistoric times. These relics of
forest growth of the distant past were
round in a solt deposit of cluy aud
cement, not in hard bed rock. liiit
the peculiar feature is that nearer tbe
surface was a lava cap. indicating
thut tho trees wore overwhelmed
prior to the ovurllow of luva; pro
bably they wore thrown down and
covered up by tbe very couvu-siou
that caused tho deposit of lava.

MINING NOTES.
Garibaldi Placer Claim.— The Gari
baldi placer claim m lioardmau
gulcb, near Volcano, la in full opera
tion by hydraulic process. It started
up nearly two weeks ago, and has
been running steadily since. This in
the mining ground about which there
has been considerable controversy,
and seems to have escaped tbe argus
eyed prospectors of early days. By
an accident its auriferous character
was discovered by tbe Garibaldi
brothers. Of course tbe operations
have not progressed tar enough to
tell anything about how it is likely
to yield, still the owners are very
confident about tbe outcome.
The tremendous' rains of the past
month has added immensely to the
flow of water in tbe mines. At the
Zeihi it requires tbe baling of water
fully one half the time to keep tbe
water down. At one tirno the water
rose in the shaft eight or ten feet in
the course of an hour.
Grazing Permits.
A notice has been posted up to tbe
eft'eot that applications for grazing
permits in tbo Move forest reserve
which , .includes^ Mono, Alpine, and
other countries, must be filed in tbe
offie ot acting supervisor J. C. Wells,
at Gardinerville, Nevada,' on or be
fore tbe Ist of March next. The
seoretary of agriculture has authoriz
ed the grazing of 3875 head of cattle
and 45,000 sheep on this reserve. The
rates established are:
From April Ist to October 15, cattle
35c, horses 50c, per head.
From May 15 to October 15, cattle
'Ma. borses 40c per head.
Sheep from June 15 to Oct. 15, 7}>je

Ran Off the Track.
On Wednesday tbe freight train be
tween Cult and lone got oil tbe track
at a point some twelve miles from
Gait, and two miles from Clay
station. One box car got astride of
the rails, and caused all the trouble.
There was not a wreck, no overturn
ed car, and no particular damage
done to track or cars. Nevertheless
it involved a great dual of work and
much delay to get the car righted.
A wrecking train had to be got from
Oalt. with all tbe necessary appli
ances to lift the displaced (tar in posi
tion. This took several hours. The
■lackson stage did ii"t reach its
destination: until midnight— about
seven hours behind time. The mail
was not distributed until tbe follow

Bea's tbo /^to Kind You llsva Always BaugtitPOLITICAL RECREANCY.
The vote of senator Caminetti, a democrat, for Gco. C. Per
kins a republican, for United States senator has elicited con*
siderable comment pro oud con. It strikes one as a most in
congruous spectacle for a legislator to vote against his party
principles in that way. It is a vote to overthrow the party
that elected him. It is doubtful whether it can be success
fully defended from any standpoint. A man running on a
party ticket, and depending mainly on the votes of those be
lieving the same way politically as himself, is supposed to
keep in line with the doctrines of his party 6n all party ques.
tions. The fact that at the polls he received a good many
votes from members of the opposite party, should not absolve
him in the least from his allegiance to the party of his choice.
Neither has he any right to promise on the hustings that in
the event of his election he will be governed in his voting on
strictly party matters by anything that will tend to break up
the organization to which he belongs. To hold otherwise
means the dissolution of party ties. There is no doubt that
the choice for United States senator so far as the senatorial
district which Caminetti represents is concerned was and is
Geo. C. Perkins. This fact cannot be pleaded in extenuation
of the representative traveling outside of his party iv casting
his vote. Neither can any promise that he made from the
stump justify such action.
AFTER CONSTABLES.
A bill is before the legislature to abolish the office ot town
ship constable. It proposes in its place to clothe the sheriff
of each county with the power to appoint as many deputies
as may be needed. The change is evidently in the direction
of making the sheriff the grand sachem politically of the
county. It would greatly enlarge the scope and political in.
fluence of that office. While the present law, giving constables
a salary, instead of being paid by. fees, as formerly, is bad
enough, this plan to concentrate all the business in the
I sheriff's office would be infinitely, worse. It would largely
swell the revenues of that official, and is not calculated to be
of any advantage as far as the detection and punishment of
crime is concerned. The constables throughout the state,
who have a fat thing as the law now stands, are gathering at
Sacramento to fight the proposition that aims to knock them
t completely out of business. No doubt the law regarding
township peace officers needs amending. It is decidely one
sided. But the scheme to raise the sheriff to a position of
"; political bossism is not likely to command public approval.
We presume this bill is one of the results of the organization
formed recently by the sheriffs of the state, with the avowed
object of protecting the interests of these officials.
HARRASSING THE PRESS.
In every legislature, there crops up some wise ones who
are actuated by a grudge against newspapers. They have
run up against the press at some time in their public career,
and got worsted, and in a spirit of vindictiveness they ima
gine it would be a good thing to change the present libel law
so that the publishers might be more easily harrassed by
malicious suits. They want to repeal the law requiring a
bond of $500 as a preliminary to the starting of a suit against
a publisher. It is true that a few publishers abuse their posi.
tion, but the vast majority of those papers which exert a
wholesome influence in shaping public opinion are governed
by conscientious motives. The present state legislature has a
sprinkling of these would-be press reformers. We are sur
prised that a man like Grove L. Johnson should be arrayed
among the number. He is an able man, and should know
better than to embark in a enterprise that holds out nothing
but disappointment and vexation. Savage is another reform
er who would take a fall out of the press. He believes that
God had nothing to do with the making of the modern news
paper anyway. We think he would be nearer the truth had
he asserted that God had nothing to do with the make-up of
the average legislature. However, the press will no doubt
survive these biennial assaults. Not one of the cinch measures
stands the ghost of a show to become a law.
Senator Caminetti has introduced a bill for the state to
build railroads, which shall be used something after the fash
ion of the present public highways. From the brief outline of
this proposition given in the press, the scheme seems to be
on the free-for-all, go-as-you-please system. Our represent
ative thinks it is just as feasible for the state to construct
railroads, and farm them out to patrons, as to build wagon
roads. It is now in order for some other visionaries to pro
pose the taking over of stage lines, factories, stores, news
papers, and every other department of industry, by the
government. Surely the milleuium dreamed of by socialists
is close at hand, when such impracticable schemes are trotted
out in all seriousness before a legislative assembly.

Fortune* For Anim»li.
Dr. Christians of Venice left CO.OOO
fiortiia for the maintenance of his tares

"young black cnt," and o Frenchman
named Souchnt left his entire fortune
to his tortoise.
Watchmakers' Oil.
Watchmakers' oil Is from ttao Jaw

The Starfith.
The starfish, netted, commits suicide.
It dissolves itself Into many pieces,
which escape through the meshes of
the net. Then a kind of resurrection
takes place, each piece growing into a
perfect starfish.
A Scotch Custom.
In many parts of Scotland It used to
be the custom to place on a man's
tombstone the symbols of his trade.
Thus a sugar cane would decorate the
grave of a grocer; an ax and saw,
with hammer and nails, would be
found on that of a carpenter, an awl
and v hammer on a shoemaker's grave,
and so on.
William Perm.
William Perm is buried at Jordans,
England. He was seventy-four years
old when he died.
The Sorvians.
The Servians are of the Slavic fam
ily and came from Gallcla In the sev
enth century. Their language Is also
Slavic, but Is distinguished from kin
dred languages by the predominance
of vowels, which render it soft and
melodious.
Tho Trick of Thieves.
A mastlir was trained to assist
thieves in Paris. It was in the habit
of bounding against old gentlemen and
knocking them over in the street. A
"lady" and "gentleman," owners of the
dog, would then step forward to assist
the unfortunate pedestrian to rise and
while doing so would ease him of bis
watch and purse.
Bangkok.
Bangkok is a city of waters. It Is an
Indo-Chinese Venice. More people live
In floating houses on the Menam, "the
Nile of Slam," and the many canals
than in permanent buildings.
Trimming Trees.
In trimming trees the wound made
by cutting off a limb close to the trunk
will soon heal over, while the wound
made by cutting off the limb two or
three inches from the trunk leads to
decay and sometimes causes the ulti
mate losa of the tree Itself.
Gold Coma.
The United States never coined gold
pieces of a higher denomination than
$20. Some years ago a jeweler at San
Francisco struck gold pieces of the
value of $50, but that was on private
account.
The War of 1812.
Many historians assert the United
States' declaration of war against Eng
land in 1812 was duo almost wholly to
the desire of the UnL.J States to an
nex Canada.
A Valuable Bible.
i A very valuable book is a Hebrew
Bible of the Vatican. In 1512 the He
brews tried to buy It of Pope Julius 11.
for its weight in gold. It is so large
nnd heavy that two men can hardly
lift It, and it would have brought
$100,000.
Coal Mines.
The oldest German coal mines were
flrst worked In 1195. They are near
Worms. England did not begin to
mine its coal until the fourteenth cen
tury.

Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises an area of
648 square miles. It lies on the wes
tern slope of Sierra Novad" uountalna,
and emoraces within It? errltory all
,tho diversity of valley •oothlll, and
high mountainous lands.
Climate.— The climate of the popu
lous portions of the county is a 8 gonlal
and healthful as can be found anywhere
In California. As climate Is one of the
most valuable assets of this favored
state In attracting population, Amador
second to no county in this re
gard. It should, and no doubt will in
time, when its climatic advantages are
more thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, become a health resort not
only for thoso in loss favored states,
but for tho residents of other parts of
Cullfornla. Tho temperature alone tho
central portion raruly falls below 30
degrees above zero In winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees in the sum
mer. Snow seldom falls In the settled
districts, and navor remains on the
pround for more than a few hours. Of
course, In the high mountain regions
of eastern Araador the snowfall is very
heavy — which Is characteristic of tho
entire Sierra Nevada ran^e. The sum
mer season Is alway accompanied with
cool nights; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs are rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
Infrequent.
Gold Mining.— The county, although
rich in other sources of wealth, cotn
. paratively untouched, Is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. The
deepest gold mines In America tire lo
cated here. The Kennedy mine Is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
3000 feet below the surface, with every
Indication that tho pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since tho dis
covery of gold, the county has contrib
uted fully $100,000000 to the world's
supply of the precious metal. The
mines are still yielding at the rate of
about two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth Is produced by
eight or ten mines operating on what
is called the "mother lode," stretching
clear across the county In a north-east
erly direction a distanco of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate betweon
400 and 500 stamps, and furnish em
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
industry is still in its infancy. The
unexplored territory, evon along tho
muiu gold belt, is far In excess of tho
ground that has actually been worked
or prospected. The county offers to
day one of the most inviting fields to
be found anywhere in the world for tho
investment of capital in the fascinating
business of gold mining, not alone along
the mother lode, but also in the almost
untouched mineralized country ot the
east belt, some tenor twelve miles from
the main lode.
Besides gold, we have copper, de
posits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
limestone, granite, and soapstone or
talc — all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities.— The agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce anything that can be
grown in the most favored sections.
In the foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetable are raised where Irrigation
is practicable along the numerous water
courses. Further up In the mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet, the
soil is admirably adapted for apples
and potatoes. A ready market for
many times the quantity now raised of
these commodities can be found lin the
various mining towns.
Grape culture and wlnemaking are
becoming Important industries, both
the grapes and wine commanding a
better price than .the product of the
lowland.
Land is cheap compared with other
California lands. Improved farms may
be secured for one-fourth the price
current in some places. Unimproved
lands can be had from $5 to $10 per
acre. It does not require a fortune to
buy a small ration. There is room for
a largo addition to our agriculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts now devoted to
cattle ranges might be made the homes
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amador has a populasionof less than
12000. Three fourths of this is concen
trated in a strip of three miles above
and below the mineral belt.
Jackson, the county seat, has about
2500 inhabitants, and loan Incorporated
city ot the sixth class. Other towns
are Sutler Creek, Amador City, Dry
town, Plymouth, Volcano, Pino Grove
and Oleta. lone City Is the meiropolis
of the vulley section, a thriving town
of 1000 Inhabitants.
The community Is law-abiding. Edu
cational facilities are excellent. A
school house Is within euay reach of
nearly every family. There is one high
school, located at lone.
The assessment roll for 1907 Is *•">.
800,793, and the tax rate for both stute
uud county purposes $2 on the 8100.
Tho Southern Pacific- has a brunch
railroad running to lone. From this
point the lone and Kustern railroad ex
tends 14 miles further to tho raining
section.
The various religious denominations
and fraternal organizations two well
represented.
The power plant of the Standard
Kleotrlo Co — one of the largolt In the

PATIENCE. V H|«
I stood within tho halls of Joy
And asked If one could point the way
To Sorrow's house. With manner coy,
Impatiently, each answered, "Nay."
I knocked upon tho door of Tain.
"Can tell whero Sorrow lives?" I cried.
But there, too, I had sought In vain.
"Joy Is my mother," Pain replied.
Then met I one whose face serene
Was as a light upon the earth.
"Sorrow," Bhe said, with gentle mien—
"Ah, yes! 'Twas sho that gave mo
birth."
—Beth Slater Whltson In Metropolitan
Magazine.
He Was Admitted.
A fussy mllitnry official once devised
a system which compelled every one
who went on business to General
Banks to procure a ticket from a mem
ber of the staff, the presentation of
which at the door gained him admis
sion. One day a burly colonel came to
tho door of the private office at head
quarters and requested that his name
be given to tho general.
"Have you a ticket?" ho was asked.
"A ticket!" echoed the colonel, with
scorn. "Xo, sir, I haven't."
"You can't enter hero without one,"
was the reply.
"Sir," said the colonel, "when Gen
eral Banks becomes a puppet show
and I have 25 cents to spare I'll buy v
ticket to see him, not before." He was
admitted.
Tom and Jerry.
Tom Reed nnd Jerry Simpson, the
noted l'opulist congressman, were
great friends. Their good relationship
came after this incident:
"Say, Jerry," said Iteed one day,
"why are you a Populist?"
I "For the same reason," said Simp
son, "that you are a Republican. A
majority of the people of our respec
tive districts are of our way of think
ing."
Tended to His Part.
Some years ago the Yankee schooner
Sally Ann, under command of Captain
Spooncr, was beating up the Connecti
cut river. Mr. Comstock, the mate,
was at ills statiou forward. According
to his notion of things the schooner
was getting a "leetle" too near certain
mud tints which lay along the larboard
shore. So aft he went to the captain
aad, with his hat cocked on one side,
said:
i'Cap'u Spooner, you're getting a lee
tle too close to them flats. Hadn't
you bettor go abeout?"
The captain glared at him.
"Mr. Comstock, Jest you go for'ard
aud tend to your part of the skuner.
I'll toad to mine."
Mr. Comstoek went for'ard In high
dudgeon.
"Hoys," he bellowed out, "see that
that er mud hook's all clear for lettin'
go!"
"Aye, aye, sir!"
"Let go, then!" he roared.
Down went the anchor, out rattled
the chains, and like a flash the Sally
Ann came luffing into the wind and
then brought up all standing. Mr.
Comstock walked aft and touched his
hat.
"Well, cap'n, my part of the skuner
Is to anchor."— Everybody's.
The Difference of a Letter.
A professor in the University of Ber
lin who came to this country a year
ago was much surprised when he
traveled in a sleeping car to be asked
by the porter for his berth ticket
"My birth ticket?" he said. "I hare
my passport, I have my letter of cred
it, and I have even in my trunk my
certificate of vaccination, bnt why the
railroad should want my birth ticket I
do not see."
"But," said the porter, "I must know
whether you have upper or lower
berth."
"Tipper, of course," said the German.
"Look at my passport. Does it not
say, 'Well and highly born?' "
Practical Economy.
If you would succeed In business
never spend a cent more than yon
earn. No matter how small your
earnings, you should master this art.
I use the word "art" advisedly, as so
many young men appear to fritter
away without so much as a thought
all their earnings.— Marshall Fleld. v
Journalistic Entorprito.
While stopping at a little Hoosier
hotel in the course of a hunting trip in
his native state Booth Tarklngton lost
one of his dogs.
"ITave you a newspaper in townT"
he asked of the landlord.
"Right across tho way, there, back
ot the shoemaker's." the landlord told
him, "the Dally News, best little paper
it its size lit the state."
The editor, the printer and the tjriut
«r*i devil were all Jmsy doing Juetlc*
to Mr. TVirklngton with an "In out
midst" paragraph when the novelist
arrived.
"I've Just lost a dost," Tnrklngton ex
plained after he lind Introduced him
self, "nnd I'd like to have you Insert
this nd for me: 'Fifty dollars reward
for the return of a pointer dog answer
ing to the name of Ilex. Disappeared
from the yard of the Mansion House
Monday night.' "
"Why, wo were Just going to press,
sir," the editor said, "but we'll he only
too glad to hold the edition for your
ad."
Mr. Tarklngton returned to the hotel.
After a few minutes he decided, how
ever, that It might bo well to add "No
questions asked" to his advertisement
and returned to the Pally News ofllce.
The place was deserted savo for tho
skinny little freckle faced devil, who
sat perched on n high stool, gazing
wistfully out of the window.
"Where Is everybody?" Tnrklngton
naked.
"Gawn to hunt th' dawg," replied tho

D'Ennery'e Wit? ' -
The Empress Eugenic ouceasked
D'Ennery, tho French dramatist, after
the performance of one of his plays at
thoTufierles, "llow did your heroine
get tho poison that was so necessary
for the denouement?" "Ah, your maj
esty," said D'Ennery, "that's Just what
I've never succeeded In getting her to
tell."
Another time the directors of a the
ater where his drama, "Tho Two Or
phans," was being rehearsed asked
him what he was dissatisfied with.
"Oh," he replied, "It's only that each
of you has got an Imbecile for a part
ner."
Wigwams and Snakes.
An American had been seated at a
Liondon dinner table next a rosy cheek
ed, gray eyed English girl who af
fected an absorbing and flattering in
terest In the United States, about
which she seemed to have imbibed the
usual extraordinary Ideas of some
Britons, especially with regard to tho
perils to be encountered In the more
sparsely settled regions of the west.
She tried her best not to be incredu
lous when assured that things were
not really so bad as she imagined.
"It's reassuring to be told that there
are not rattlesnakes In all the gar
dens," she said, with a dazzling smile,
"but my cousin wrote me not long
since that ho had seen over twenty
wigwams in one little village. Per
haps," she added as her companion
made no Immediate response, "per
haps the wigwams are not as veno
mous as rattlesnakes."
A Sartorial Reflection.
A young clergyman en his first ap
pearance In the pulpit made a faux
pas in a sermou directed against the
very human fault of vanity. "Many a
good woman comes into God's house
to show off (perhaps she doesn't quite
realize it, but the fact Is unchanged)—
to show off her best clothes." Then
he glanced across the crowded pews
and added, "I am thankful, dear
friends, to see that none of you has
come here for so unworthy a reason."
When God Lets Looso a Thinker.
Beware when the great God lets
loose a thinker on this planet. Then
all things arc at risk. It Is as when
a conflagration has broken out In a
great city, and no man knows what Is
safe or where It will end. There is
not a piece of science but Its flank
may be turned tomorrow. There is
not any literary reputation, not the so
called eternal names of fame, that may
not be revised and condemned. The
very hopes of man, the thoughts of
his heart, the religion of nations, the
manners and morals of mankind, are
all at the mercy of a new generaliza
tion. Generalization Is always a new
Influx of the divinity Into the mind;
hence the thrill that attends it.— Ralph
Waldo Emerson.
Easily Wakened.
When Dr. Blomfleld was bishop of
London he received several letters
complaining that tho architect of a
new church In bis diocese bad disfig
ured the Interior and exterior with
"useless gewgaws." Consequently the
bishop went down to the little town to
make an Inspection of the building
and summoned the architect to meet
him there.
The bishop could find nothing amiss
with the exterior of the church nor
with the Interior until just as he reach
ed the chancel he looked up and saw
four wooden images apparently guard
ing the pulpit.
"What do those figures represent?"
he Inquired.
"The four evangelists, my lord," re
plied the architect.
"They appear to be asleep," said the
bishop.
"Do you think so, my lord?"
"That's the way they look to me,"
said the bishop decidedly.
"John," called the architect to a
man who was at work on one of thu
pews, "bring your chisel and open the
eyes of the evangelists."
To Benefit the Poor.
A lot of minstrels went to an Eng
lish country town and advertised to

The Flood at Angels.
A prlvute letter published in tbe
Stockton Rucui'd gives the following
particulars of tbe disaster at Angles
Camp:
Altavillo, Jan. 22, 1909.
Dear Sister— We weut down to sco
the Angels Hood ruius yosterd(\.v. It
wns a sorry-loolsiug eicbt. We, had a
qerrible storm Wednesday uight. Thu
rain came down in tot-ronts all night
long. 1 negan to tbink tbat tbe time
had come lor us to pass in our checks.
The Angels creek wipod out China
town completeiy.and ono poor China
man lost his life. Dr. Pacha's house,
wbich stood on tbe creek, a black
smith shop and a bnrneES shop were
carried down stream. You would
never know tbat a bouse bad stood
there. The front steps of Dr. Pacbe's
present residence were taken off. The
bridge was wiped out and George
lirodie's bouse was washed about
eight feet down tbe side of tbe, creek.
Tbe water was a foot and a bait
high in Wesley Richards' . livery
stable. They thought tbat building
was going, too, so they turned all of
tbe burses loose. j
,1 The Stickle mill sustained con
siderable damage. Kin^sley's folks
were living in Dr. Pacho'a house on
the creek. They lost everything' and
baroly got out witb their lives. They
may consider themselves fortunate.
'J'bo house was battered to pieces
aud carried down with tbe currant.
There is not one stick of it. Mi.
Another poor man, who- bought the
blacksmith shop only a shoit time
ago, paid 8100 for it, arid olut overy
tbing. Gnu uf his sous slept in the
shop and very nearly lost his life.
The flood camo between 3:30 and 4
o'clock iv the morning and the lights
\vert> all out. it was as dark as»could
be and tbo raiu was still tailing iv a
continuous downpour.
Tliu train did not get to' Angola
Thursday night. The Milton stage
did not leave Angels at all yesterday.
Tbe bridges between Angels aud
Jamestown are washed away and will
be some time before trains can begin
running again.

burglary was committed iv on the
third Uoor, with a window over the

was a perilous feat, as tho intruder
had to climb over the banister, aud
then open tho window, and climb
into tbo room, running the risk of
falling into the stairway opening and
bicuking his neck. A man under the
influence of liquor would be wary
about taking the ohauces. Darling
got in that way, the marks of his feet
being left on tho window sill. The
accused admits tlie deed and also that
he bas served a torm in the state

News was received bore Thursday
of tbe most disastrous effects ot the
heavy rain of that morning at Angels.
It would appear that something in
tbe nature of a cloud kurat struck
that vioinity between tbiee and four
o'clock In tbe morning and for a
time the sight was appalling. Angels
cieek was quickly a ragging torrent
sweeping over its banks and carrying
everything before it. Chinatown was
Hooded and many of tbe bouses
were washed bodily down tbe stream,
"ibe bridge on tbe road to Carson was
carried away, but tbo upper bridge
stood fast. It is impossible at this
writing to get tull particulars, but we
/earn tbiit one Chinaman was drown
ed and that many of tbe residents of
Chinatown barely escaped with their
lives, some having to cut tbelr way
through tbe roofs of bouses. Tbe
blacksmith shop near the bridge was
carried away and a hardware store
■croia tbe creek shared tbe same fate.
Water stood 18 inches deep In Rich

Story of a Case
of Sharp Practice.
"1 once came over ou tho same boat
with Charles W. Morse, "said a
Cbiaßgoau. "in a talk about finance
over a bridge garue one afternoon Mr
Morse told us a story of sharp prno
tlce.
"lie snkl there wus a couch that
used to run between »Noln Ctiucky
and Paint Kock, a matter of some ten
miles. For lunch tbo coach stopped
at a half-way house In Tin Can, and
boro a good f>O-uent meal was put out
— cake and pie, coffee and tea, and
all the cold moots you could mention.
"Hut the landlord of the half-way
house had n moan little secret dicker
w|th tno driver whereby, as soon as
tbo travelers liiul paid lor tueir luncb
and got faitly sottled to It, a call
would come tor an immediate start.
So oft they'd nil go, grumbling.
They'd paid tor 50 cents' worth of
food aud only eatcu, you see, about
5 cents' worth.
"lint along came one day a traveler
with a sharp, right eye. The land
lord found this chap, acme ten minu
tes after tbe coach had started on
again, still tucking pie and ham at a
terrible rate.
"Why, man, he said, you've let tbe
coach go without you.'
"1 know it, said tbe traveler, calm
ly, 1 wus too blessed hungry to stop
eating.'
"Suddenly the landlord's face
paled.
"(Jooil gracious!' he said, 'all my
sliver's gone!'
"It whc, too. Not a knife, fork or
spoon was left except tbe sharp-eyed
man 7.
"He said, as he kept ou eating,
that he hud noticed a suspicious
looking character among the passeng
ers--a man witli a. red beard, a hump
and a limp— ob, very suspicious.
"Tho landlord sent a hostler on a
swift motooyoie off to overtake the
coach and bring it back. ;
"Well, in about forty minutes tbe
coach returned. Then the sharp-eyed
man came forth, wiping bis mouth.
But be made no effort to identify tbe
suspicious-looking passenger. Instead
he got aboard tbejeoaen, took his seat
and said, coolly:
"Thanks, landlord, for the good
feed. You'll find them spoons and
things in tbe coffee pot. Now, driver,
ol we go again."

AN EXPERT'S REFLECTIONS
A Santa CruzOrand Jury That Goes
After Things.
I'be Hnntn Ctuz grand Jury's expert
reported yesterday, severely criticiz
ing the supervisors nf that county.
He finds that 814,000 were paid ont
ou over 500 warrants for labor with*
out stating where the labor was per*
formed and tbut mad sprinkling
amounting to 815,!ft2G whs performed
by days' work iustead of by contract,
lie also called nttetitiou to npparent
discrepancies between the 1008 In
ventoiles of county uroperty In pos
session of the supervisors and the ID;
ventorles of 1!)00, allowing for new
purchases in 11)08. The expert report
ed that iudlgonta should he required
to give receipts for all supplies furn
ished and that such supplies should
be purobnsed at wholesale and not
retail rates. The export nlso recom
mended that tho superintendent of
tho county hospital let tils employes
sign their own salary warrants, in
stead of signing them bimeolf. That
graud jury decided to remain In ces

that tho laws are obeyed.
LARGE INCREASE IN CUT
OF GOVERNMENT TIMBER.
Washington, Jan.— Uncle Sinn's
national forests yielded an increase
of 102 per cent in timber last year
over tbe rocoid lor lEO 7, giving re
turns of 8849,027.24 to the govern
ment. Twenty-five per cent of this
amount went back to tbe states' in
which tbe forests are located in lion
of taxes, in accordance with tbe pro
visions of tho law. This revenue will
be added to the state's fund for tbe
support and maintenance of roads
and public schools.
The amount of timber cut from all
tho national forests was 392,792,000
feet, board measure, as against 194,
872,000 feet in tbe prei ious year.
This figure for 1908 does not include
the 131,482,000 feet given away to
settlers, schools and churches under
"free use" permits. This increase ot
102 jier cent shows a far better uso
and increasing productiveness of tho
forest under conservative methods of
cutting. There was a marked increase
in small sales lost year insulting in
an increase of 236 per cent in tb«
number of sulee, notwithstanding tbe
fact that tbe timber contracted for
was tar less in the aggregate than in
1907.
In making timber sales the forest
service seeks small in preference to
large sales, and aims to Bafeguard a
supply for future needs rather than
to swell the immediate receipts.
Were it desired, the "present receipts
from timber sales could be quickly
doubled. During the year it was
found necessary iv the interest of a
continued supply to restrict sales on
many forests. Nevertheless, use of
the natioual forests as a source of
timber supply was more general than
ever before.
The total receipts from timber sales
each year have been as follows: 1905,
Sb'o,l3<i.G2; 1906, 8245,013.49; 190",
8668,813.12; 1908,8840,027.24.
Payment for timber is always re
quired in advance. In large sales,
however, and in small sales on occas
ion, payment is made in installments
so arranged as to protect tbe govern
ment against loss without imposing
unuecesaarily severe burdens upon
the purchaser. Thu3 the receipts of
each year represent substantially, but
not exactly, the value of tbe timber
sold and removed during tnat year.

Tho quarrying of lithographic atone
is the unique industry of the little
German town of Solenhofen, about 45
miles south of Nuremberg. The
material ia a compact limestone of
peculiar texture and a yellowish-gray
or bluish-gray color, hard bluish
stones being the moie valuable, and
Coosul 11. W. Harris, of Nuremberg,
reports that the known area contain
ing tboso stones is not more than 4
or 5 miles long by 2or 3 wide. Ibis
little spot baa supplied the world's
litbograptiio stones for more than a
oeutuiy, while the supply promises to
lust at least oue or two centuries
longer. The deposit is in layers of
half an inch to ti or 7 inches thick,
extending from the surface to a
depth of 100 feet or more, and much
broken and worthless rook is uontain
ed. Not more than one-twelfth of
the stone removed is marketable,
much of this having small valuo on
acoount of the small sizes of the
clear pieces. Tho industry employs
1200 men, and the product goes to all
the civilized countries, the leading
buyers being Germany, France, Italy
and tbe United States iv the order
named.
The curious toy motor of Lucien
Kournier, lately awaided the grand
prize at a French exhibition, seems
at first to furnish energy from noth
ing. Over a shallow vessel is mount
ed horizontally an axle, with a heavy,
ioose-Utting rod passing at light
angles through it, and the ends of
axle and rod are connected by cords
of hemp. When liquid is poured into
the vessel, the two lower cords are
soaked and shrink, forcing tho rod
up. This raises the oenter of gravity,
and tbe upper end of- the rod falls,
turning the axle and immersing the
other pair of cords. Evaporation re
laxes tbe top cords, so that tbe rod is
again pushed up. Hlow rotation can
be thus kept up, and with several
rods and sets of oords, it can be made
fairly regular and continuous.

must be gauged accurately, nothing
serves like tbe hour-glass witb the

CITY OFFICIAL PAPER.
FRIDAY ..JANUARY 20, 190!)
LOCAL EDITORIAL COLUMN.
THE JAPANESE QUESTION.
The anti-Jnpanese bills before the California legislature are
stirring up a lot of discussion, aiid engendering some feeling
on both sides of the Pacific ocean. The bills aim to prevent
Japanese from owing laud in this state, and to prohibit them
coming here in future, at least as settlers. The Japanese
government regards this as an affront to that nation, inas
much as it denies to Japanese rights which other aliens en
joy. For instance, Europeans are allowed to buy and sell
real estate., whether naturalized citizens or not. why then, it
is argued, should the little brown men be made an exception.
No doubt there is some force in this argument. President
Roosevelt, realizing the seriousness of any hostile legislation
iio the direction proposed, has appealed to governor Gillett to
use his influence in preventing the enactment of these
measures into law. They are calculated to breed trouble, and
defer rather than facilitate the settlement of the Asiatic
problem. It is urged that the Japanese government is doing
jts utmost to stop the further immigration of Japanese to the
Pacific coast. On the other hand, it is said, the invasion of
the Japanese continues, in spite of .the government's efforts
to suppress it, and this fact is pleaded as the reason for the
proposed enactment of more severe restrictive laws.
It requires no particular gift of foresight to predict that the
Mongolian races whether Chinese or Japanese, must eventually
be excluded from America. This will be done not in a feel
ing of hostility to these people, but in the spirit of self-protect,
ion. Admitting the marvelous developement of Japan in late
years, and its formidable character as a competitor in com
merce or war, still they belong to a non-assimilative class,
whose presence here in large, numbers should audjmust even
tually be prohibited at all hazards. President Roosevelt is in
favor of accomplishing this diplomatically, without stirring
up friction between the two countries, and this is undeniably
the better way to proceed, even if it does require a few more
years to reach the desired goal. Governor Gillett will cooper
ate with the federal authorities in this direction. The hostile
measures will doubtless be withdrawn or strangled in ; some
way. Still they serve a purpose, inasmuch as they .demon
strate the determination of the American people, in those sec
tions where the Asiatic peril is fully appreciated by actual
contact with the Mongolian races, to get rid of the evil, even
though it should eutail a breach of the good feeling existing
between the two nations.
The special session which is to be called immediately upon
the adjournment of the present congress for the expres pur
pose of revising the tariff, will be a lively affair. The rival
interests are gathering data, and making all necessary ar
rangements to safe guard their respective sides. It will prove
a very dificult and complicated task to change a tarriff sche
dule which has prevailed for so many years, in a manner that
will fair to all concerned. Of course, in any revision
it is impossible to please all the contending parties. The ob
ject aimed at is to so reconstruct the tariff rates that no injury
will result to domestic industries, at the same time prevent
the factories from collecting enormous and extortionate rates
for their goods, to the detriment of the home consumers.
