I Sjil surveys., we a bjgin in- the
United States in 13JJ,~anJ by June
30, 1906, according to J. A. Bonateel,
an aggregate of 118, 636 square miles,
or 75,959,8(35 acres, bad been mapped
in. 43 states and four territories,
this being about one twenty-Qf th .of
the whole country and a little less
than one tenth of the land actually
in farms. Tho field work of survey
consist in determining the texture,
structnre.quantity and distribution ot
organic matter, internal natural
drainage and topographic relief of
the soils. Closely similar areas are
classed in the same soil type, several
types differing only in texture or
degree of coarseness or fineness from
a series, and several series of similar
origin and climatic and other condi
tions conatitute a province. .At present
13 great soil provinces, 58 soil series,
and 461 soil types have baen recog
nized. The Norfolk sand, a warm,
porous soil adapted to truck crop?,
has been mapped over 2660 square
miles in 34 areas of 14 Eastern' States;
and the Marshall silt loam, neatly
all -specially suitable for coin, has
been mapped over 6123 square miles
of 22 areas in 9 States— a great area
being still unmapped.
| A new intoxication ' menacing
society ' has been brought to notice
through Dr. MoKendrick of the Uni
versity^, of Glasgow. Carbon tetrack
lorde, a colorless, non-inflammable
liquid differing but slightly from
chloroform in composition and hav
ing similar anaesthetic etfect. is! a
safe clothes-cleaning materal, and cf
late has been used as a "dry sham
poo." Its danger has been made
known by a lady who struggled to
keep consciousness under the sham
poo. The hairdresser affirmed that
the effects are liked, and a carbon
tetrachloride habit seems to be de
veloping.
An estimate of-Maroh and November
bird-food near Washington has shown
1,216,880 animal objects, and 2,107,

One of the strangest as well as most
costly articles of commerce ia snake
venom, for which there is a growing
demand in medicine and other
branches of science - The supply
comes from Australia, and a recent
Sydney quotation placed the market
price at 20 to 25 shillings per grain,
or about $30,003 per pound troy, no
attempt seeming to have been made
hitherto to distinguish between the
poison of snakes whose bite is usual-
ly fatal and that from reptiles that
S9ldom kill. Dr. TideweU, of the
New South Wales Health Depart
ment, states that the venoms are now
bjing classified. Laboratory experi
ments place the tiger-suake venom
first, as it is 16 times as deadly as
that of the black snake and tour
times as powerful as that from the
brown snake or the death-adder. In
average yield at a bite, the death-ad
der supplies three times as much as
the tiger snake and 17 times as much
&3 tho brawn snake. So far the
snakes have bean mostly captured by
hand, to avoid Ins 3of poison, and, at
even greater personal risk,, have bseu
held iv tho hand while bain^ euragad
and made to bite through a -rubbar
banJ, ejecting upon a glass plate the
venom from the two poison-faugs in
the upper jaw. Each snake has sup
plied tha. material from one bite,
averaging about a grain. A naw
discovery ia that the supply in the
fang 3is renewed, and in the future
snakes farmers may 'milk' tli3 poison
from well kept reptile 3 every two
days for an inlofinite period.
A serious risk of tuberculosis from
pet birda is alledged .by Dr. Tucker
Wise of Moatreux, who records 33
case 3of apparent infestion, with
other evidence froai e'a.neat physi
cians. The lifo of caged birds like
canaries, pigeon 3 and parrots—es
pecially favors tuuberculous disease,
and the fluttering of their wings and
the action of flies readily convey in
fection to tba family. As 400,000
canary birds are sold in England
yearly, the iufluoaej upon public
health is believed to bo important.

There is an organization known ns

of the (J olden West. Its members are
exclusively Chiuosa torn in this state.
And to their credit be it said that
they aro trying to do and . probably
will do etTectively, what; the- state
and federal government have "utterly
failed .to accomplish, 'namely, des
troy tho slave trade ' among the
Chinese. This they wilijlo, by means
ot a seroret service all over the coast.
The organization has also, adopted
resolutions to destroy the tongs, thus
doing away with the tong wars and
many of the things which among
Chinese are abhorrent to " the white
people. May they bo successful. ,. v
His Class.
The head of a large mercantile bouse
received not long go a letter from a
millionaire banker in the west,asking
that the letter's son be placed in
some business bouse where he could
learn "things from the bottom up."
The writer explained that his off
spring was no good at home."
Soon aftor, according to Harper's
Weekly, the western millionaire re
ceived the following reply from his
New York friend: . -.•' '■■"•' .
"Dear Blank— Your hopeful has ar
rived, j I have given him employment
in my establishment 'at 86 a week,
with others of his classs. One of
these young men bas just bought a

Ottis E. Stevens, living at 52S Fair

bad beou troubled for two or three
years from kidney complaint and a
dull heavy pain across the small of

form their functions pioperly, the
secretions being unnatural and the
passages too troqaent, greatly dis
turbing my rest at night. 1 used
many remedies but did not succeed
in finding relief until 1 heard of
Doan's Kidney Pills and procured a
box. They gave me such relief in a
short time that 1 continued their uso

The state prison directors met at
San Quentin yesterday and discussed
the case of William Evans,- the con
vict who claims that he was railroad
ed to the prison in 1891 by men who
desired to win the reward offered for
the capture and conviction of the
perpetrator of the murder of Mike
Tovey committed in Amador county.
Evans is imprisoned under a life sen
tence. Affidavits, including the
deathbed confession of one of the
prosooutors of Evans, wero presented
as proof of his innocence. Many of

imprisoned unjustly and : praotioally
robbed of 13 years of bis life, aud
are of the opinion that everything
possible should be done by the state
in the nature of a reparation. Action
on tho matter was not taken yester
day, however, as the directors said
that they desired proof of the abso

on Evans now declares that he is in

TAX RATE, THROUGHOUT
THE STATE f OR 1907
The State Controller's olfloo ha 3
compiled and will issue shortly j the
annual sheet of assessment and tax
ation figures, which, includes amorg
other thing 9, the county tax rate for
every county in the state. In tho
following table appears the inside and
outside tax rate ot all the counties
with the exception of Imperial which
has not yet been reported officially.
By insidn rate is meant the county
tax. rate (not including stata tax)
which is paid inside of incorporated
towns and cities; by outside rate is
meant the county rate outside of
such incorporated places. ■- • ;
Although in most counties the road
tax ia 40 cents, there are counties in
which a larger aggregate of road taxes
is paid in the incorporated districts;
thus Los Angelea pays 60 cants road
tax and Santa Cruz pays an equal
amount, la one or two other counties
the aggregate of road taxes is 50 cents.
Most of the oountie3 have a larger
tax rate than last year, although in
all bat two counties the assessment
roll was increased. Indeed, there
are only sixteen out of fifty-seven
counties in which the outside rate is
not higher in 1907 than it was in'lUOS.
Th-330 sixteen are Alameda, Del Norte
Fresno, Mariposa, Mendoaino, Mer
ced, Napa, Placer, Sacramento, San
Bernardino, San Diego, Stanislaus,
Toh'icuA, Trinity. Tuolumno : and
One reason for .increased taxes
which, applies to a number of coun
tio3 is the. necessity of replacising
brid^oa and roid3 which were de
stroyed in tha great storm 3of last
winter. . •-••

FR1DAY........ :.OOTOBER2S, 1907
Compared With Other Counties.
We publish iv another column a
statement compiled in the state con
troller's offloe, snowing the tax rate
iv - the reapeotire - counties - for the
year 1907. The figures give only the
total levy for county purposes, and
do not include the levy for state pur
poses. These statistics are always an
iuteieiing study.-. The people of each
county want to know how their gover
nmental ' expenses ' compare with
their sister counties. Do we 'manage
to get along in tho housekeeping bus
iness' as economically as our neigh
bor! ' Does it take more or less per
capita tax to maintain ourjlocal estab
lishment than other communities that
are similarly situated. A critical ex
amination of the list -awakens sur-.
prise in several respects. ■ The lowest
•rats, Cor instance, is inSaoramento
county, ;which carries off. the banner
with a l«vy $1,015: Contra Coata,
■Mar in and . Yolo come next, with
>■' 11.105. I'he heaviest . rate is in Mono
OOQHty, : with; $2,555 just Jl more
than Amador. % county. Next oomea
Madara with 82.335, and Yuba with
92.25j. There are fourteen counties,
out of a total of 57 in the state, with
a higher tax rate than Amador. ■ These
are " Alpine, i ■ Butte, Lake, M adera,
Mariposa, : ■ Mono, San Diego, Santa
Cruz, Shasta, Sierra, Solano, Trinity,
Ventura and, Yuba. There are six
counties having . the same rate as
. Amador, namely, Inyo, £1 Dorado,
Plamas, San j tienito, Santa Barbara,
and iulare. This leaves 35 counties
with a less rate than Amador. .
The difference in the table publish
ed elsewhere between- the inside and
outside rate 3, . shows the amount
levied in the respective counties for
road purposes. A few of the coantibs
have dd incorporated towns, and in
these of course tbe Inside and out
- side figures are the same, and hence
* the amount levied for road * purposes
is not revealed. There are only seven
counties in this list. Owing to the
severe storms of last winter, involving
the wieok*of bridges and the tearing
up of the roadbeds far beyond "the or
dinary, the-; road .taxes--' throughout
the state were expected to be abnor
mally high. And ..this expectation
is fulfilled probably beyond all pre
cedent. Sacramento county enjoys
the distiction of getting along with
the lowest road tax, 'JO cent Kern
comes next, with 25 cents. Only 10
counties missed the' opportunity of
-patting the road tax below the limit
of. 40 cents. Twenty-one 'counties
reachod the limit. Eleven exceeded
the limit, These are Amador, Lake,
Los Angeles,' Merced, Riverside, San
Bernardino, San Diego, = San Mateo,
Talare, Tuolumne and Sierra. 01
. these high graders, in only two in
stances is the Amador rate of 52 cents
eclipsed. V These ' counties are Los
Angeles and San Diego, with 60 cents
each, it would be absured to com
pare the • conditions in these two
counties with Amador. Los Angeles
| is full of incorporated cities, and is
notable forthe.excellont character of
her roads. She takes a pride in keep
ing her highway up to a high state of
efficiency; more so probably than
: any other county in the state. They
bare something substantial to show
for the heavy outlay. Her 'mileage
is far greater than that of our own
... county, and the cost of maintenance
falls exclusively on the country dis-
tricts. It is "not to be wondered at,
therefore, that her managers boost
the tax' file -cp to^bablcite^limit—
with 40 oents for regularrleyy,' and a
special of 20 cents for .'maTnf; through*
fares. San Diego has a vast territory
to cover, and the tax falls on sparely
settled districts. All things consid
ered, dmdor is entitled to the palm
for the heaviest road taxet. ; If to
this oould be added the .best kopt
highways, it would be some consola-
tion. But we must draw the line on
that proposition. The inference does'
not hold good by a lona shot.^? - ' ;
• San Francisco Politics.
-^ City politics in San Francisoo were
/never so mixed up as at present, in
< regards to the pending election for
"municipal officers, farty lines are
•~- _ewept away,and it is more of a contest
. betwheen rival factions than any
, thing else. Kach faotion is trying to
impress upon the voters that the sal-

For the

To succeed these days you

MoCarthy. This appeals to the labor
organizations, contending that' the
union movement is in issue. They be
lieve that w>th a united front
at the polls they can elect their
ticket, and hold on to the city pat
ronage.' lint a largo proportion of
union men are opposed to mixing up
in politios, and will refuse to vote tbe
ticket. It is conceded by the busi
ness and financial interests generally,
that the success of the labor party
vvould be a calamity to San Fran

building of tho stricken city The
contest seems to be narrowed down
between ' Ryan and Taylor, . and tbe
outcome depends largely upon which

The Indian Reservation.
Geo. O. Grist, who has charge of
the Indian reservation about three
inles northeast of here, says he has
11 Indiana on tbe reservation all
told. This includes children, as
well as tbe aged and inßrm. There
are a score or more scattered through
lhe county, who would be pleased to
find a home on the reservation if they
were provided with means of support.
Most of those left tbe home which
tbe United States in its bounty made
for them, they were left
without support. They concluded if
they bad (o depend upon charity of
neighbors for maintenance they oould
do better in otber sections, because
the settlers in vicinity of the reserve
are and have been for years;": pestered
almost beyond endurance with the
beggars of the Digger tribe. How
ever , we are pleased to state that tbe
lot of those remaining is -improved
to what it used to be. They hare
ouitivated a nice garden '.'and raise
considerable of- what they need in
the, way of food stuff. The govern
ment has made no better, provision
for maintenance than in years past.
In faot there is practically no appro
priation for rations, so the wards of
the nation must shift for themselves—
hunt their own living. This is all
right for the vigorous among them,
but for the aged and infirm its jars
sadly with the obligations of the
nation toward those in whose in
terest they have moved by ostensibly
setting aside a home where they are
supposed to be taken oare of, in a
manner befitting a generous govern
ment.

She. has been -in. a semi-conscious
condition since, though at present
she is thought to be ont of danger.
The parties | were returning from

ed down tho hill, at Kennedy Flat,
decided to -turn around and go back
for something: ThY road' is lather
narrow there, ■; so ,;the carriage went
over the end of the culvert that
crosses the road at this point, spill
ing all of them out. The horses bo
came frightened and started toward
Sutter, but turned A own the lone road
at Martells. John Hose, who'hap
pened to be there when they passed,
jumped on his horse and caught them
a short distance down the road. The
vehicle was not very badly damaged.

field Consolidated Mining Company,
which company: is controlled by the
Nixon-Wingfleld interest. It was
only last week that he had any in
timation that he was being .consid
ered for the place. At that time he
received a letter from the company
offering him the place and asking
him to get there as soon as conven
ient. W. •R.-j/IJhomas, who ran the
Central far so long . a time, will re
lic re Mr " Hampton as a. favor to
him until the - company can get an

Mr. Hampton- is a man deserving
of the best in the mining field.
Since a boy he has been, working in
the; mines and by close, application
and' study, has fitted himself to ac
cept one of the best jobs in the coun
try .in the ... mining . business. . The
people of Amador county know him
Drat as superintendent of the Onieda,
which place he held for about five
years up to the time it closed a short

In Nevada he will have charge of
operations at the five mines compris
ing the Goldfield Con. 
If Mr. Hampton finds that the
schools there are goodhis family will
join him as soon as be finds a place.

Harrow' Escape,
W. C. Hos'a of^ Pioneer, and .the
scrfoolmarm of that district, met with
antoxciting e^perence last .Saturday
morning. The schoolteacher, Dr.
Alice Bradley, wished to go by the
morniug train for ", Sacramento, and
Mr. Hoss undertook the task of con
veiug her with his team to MarteH's
; ini^time ,to 'catch: the ; trainj^ which
leaves '.about B : o'clook. Aa the dis
tance from Hoss' place to MarteH's is
fully twenty miles, they had to start
about^three '"o'clock," ano^'make' the
greater part of the journey in dark
ness. /At d point, ou the foad above
Aqueduct, -Miss Bradley noticed that
the mules were leaving the road, and
that the wagon was on the point. of
going- over | the bank. ; She- jumped
off ion the lower aide, > landing- safe
ly. Mr. Hoss Was not so fortunate
He was struck on the head as the
wagon capsized and remained uncon
scious for five minutes. The school
teacher '-was equal to the emergency,
she never lost her presence of mind.
At puce she caught hold of the mules
and thereby prevented, a* runaway.
Mr. Hoes was only stunned fora brief
space, and when he recovered the
two managed to get the wagon on its
foot 'auaki, and continued the trip,
making the depot in time to catch the
train. '

HOW I CAME TO
BE A FARMER.
[Orisinal.]
•' When" I ;was a. young man, having
iread a great' deal about the failure oi
officials .to find and bring to justice
£ illicit distillers in "Tennessee, I was
seized with a desire^ to try my hand at
the business. Polk county swarmed
with moonshiners, and to Polk county
I went. Reaching the locality that 1
sought, I began operations by pump
ing the inhabitants.' Passing. a farm
faouse I saw a good looking young wo
man on the porch taking care of a
wuple df little children. I dismounted,
■went in and asked for a drink of wa
ter. The woman pointed to a gourd
hanging in a well house, and I helped
myself. Then, before asking any ques
tions, I played with the children with
a view to opening a way to the moth
er's confidence.
"Sorry your husband isn't at home,"
I said. "I'm looking* out for timber
lands. Perhaps he might know of
some to sell."
"I haven't got a husband," she re-,
piled; "I'm a widder." v
She went on to tell me that it was
hard for her to get on since her hus
band's death. The country was ruined
by the illicit distilling that was goin»
on. Instead of farming, everybody was
making whisky, and that kept respect

"Would you," I asked, "be willing to
do something to get rid of the moon
shiners?"
"Well, I don't like to git my neigh
bors down on me."
"But supposing you could make a
nice thing of It." \ '
.."What d'y' call a nice thing?"
I named a sum I was willing to pay
for the information I desired.
"Look a-here, - stranger," she said.
"You hain't after lumber; you're
a-huntin' stills. Now, if you double that
.what yo' said, if s a go." '
J; I complied with the terms, and she
gave me minute Information as to
•where I could find a half dozen secret
whisky manufactories, with the name?
of persons who knew all about 'them
and could testify to their existence
and ownership in court ;
| Having kissed the children— l want
ed to kiss the widow, too; she wa«
ver y tempting— l mounted my horse,
confirmed the information given me
by pretending to stumble on the stills
■while hunting timber lands, then rode
to the county seat and swore out war
rants for the persons whose names
had been given me as the owners ans
subpoenaed the witnesses.
Some time was required to serve the
papers, and It was several weeks be-
i fore we were ready for trial. Mean
■^^.Tvhllel called frequently on the widow,
•^'becoming quite at home In her house.
taking tbe children out to walk with
me while their mother was busy with
v
Her household duties. I feared that
my being so much at her home would
lead those whom I was prosecuting to
suspect that she had given me Un
necessary Information, but they didn't
seem to trouble her. I began, to feel
that I would not mind settling in Ten
nessee with a view to ministering to
the widow and the fatherless.
When the case carco up for trlal.it
became apparent that the stills I liatl
seen were small ones, the main stills
where the bulk of the whisky v was
made remaining undiscovered. Tho
fees paid the witnesses — whose testi
mony was worthless — cost the state a
round penny, and the amount paki
the widow was a dead ; loss to me. I
was riding away from the courthouse
much discomfited when one of my
witnesses overtook me.
"Stranger," he said, "what'd you uns
give for some more information?"
"Nothing." •„,•■
"Well, I'll give it to you anyway.
The widder that put y' on to 'em owned
the hull kit. Her husband owned all
the big stills about hyar, and when he
was shot a year ago by a revenue offi
cer his widder tuk the property and
has been runnln' it ever since. Hyar's
a paper she writ you uns."
He handed me a missive from the
widow inviting me to take supper with
her that; evening. I thanked the man
for his Information and, turning, rode
to the widow's home.
."Stranger," she said, "I hain't no
great lover fer still hunters, seem' my,
husband was shot by a 'revenue,' but
I hain't got over your takin' a shine
to- Tommy and Maudle. Here's the
money you uns paid me fer puttin' you
nns on to the stills. I own 'em, and
the witnesses I give y' air all hi my
employ. Reckon it wouldn't be right
to take pay. fer that. The state can
afford to pay the witness fees."
We were soon seated at a table on
which was a delicious supper of ham
and eggs, biscuit, corn bread and eof
fee. The widow did everything she
could to make me forget my failure to
break up moonshining in Polk county,
and by the time I had finished my sup
per I was in a very contented frame
of mind. While I smoked she put her
children to bed, and during the time
rhe was "doing" the dishes I -went into
the room where the little tots lay and
played with them till she had finished
When they were asleep the widow sat
down beside me and said:
"I want to git out o' this moon
shlnin'. I'm a lone woman, and, though
I'm no fool at turnin' off 'revenues,' I
hain't got the head fer turnin 1 my
property Into money." _ ■
"You're a rough diamond," I said,
drawing her to me. "I'll help you
out on one condition."
"What Is it?"
"That you marry me."
She consented, and in a short time
I had turned her stills Into cash, with
which I stocked the farm. Meanwhile
we were married, and I make a much
better farmer than detectjve.
ROGER PERKINS.
ARCTIC COTTON PLANT.
The Climax of Nature's Irony In the
Far North. V
. j The climax of nature's irony in the
arctic is the cotton plant, says the Cir
cle. Wherever cotton blooms, declares
the miner, ice is not far below. One
may trudge for miles through fields of
cotton, the white, silky tops swaying
defiantly in the ' arctic breeze. The
blossom is silky, dainty,. illusive as the
down of our own yellow dandelion.
From the beginning of June on until
August the tundra is white with the
cotton plant. Unlike the cotton of the
southern states, the fiber is short and
soft, having moro vt the texture of silk
than of cotton.
The cotton plant will in all probabil
ity some day be the means of develop
ing an Alaskan industry giving em
ployment to thousands. Today, howev
er, the cotton fields are purely decora
tive—a splendid sweep of immaculate
bloom in a bleak, timberless landscape
guarded by hills ever hung in veils of
deepest purple. In great bouquets it is
occasionally met In a miner's shack,
while not a few housewives gather the
cotton for pillow'filling.
Throughout the cotton fields flowers
bloom in abnormal splendor, as be
comes a country in which the sun
shines continuously during summer's
voluptuous reign. It is an intoxicating
joy for the' flower hunter to gather
great armfuls of purple larkspur, blue
bells, monk's head, primroses, sweet
peas, beautiful purple and red asters
large as the most cultivated, lilies of
the valley, baby. breath, yellow arrow,
sage rose, pink and white arctic gera
nium, crimson rhododendrons and gi
ant flreweed, all growing on the hill
sides. To enumerate further is 'to re
produce a florist's catalogue.

After the
Storm.
LULU
JOHNSON
Copyrighted, 1907,' by C. H. Satellite.
Brooks raised the shade and looked'
ont, saying things softly to himself.
▲ sodden landscape merged into lead
en skies, and a fine, driving rain veiled
but slightly the misery of the scene.
Across the road ' a score of ducks
waddled contentedly- through the mud
dy field to a puddle that had formed
In a corner of the lot, but half a dozen
bedraggled hens squawked dolefully as
they, picked up the angleworms driven
fo the surface by the continued rain
and rushed back to shelter. The cows
iv the. side pasture huddled . under the
dripping- trees, and the dog trotted
across the road with his tall dragging
almost in the mud as he made for the
protection of the barn after being driv
en from the inviting kitchen door.
Brooks had come to Centerville for a
purpose— a purpose that was not best
served by confinement in a country
boarding house for seven day 3 • and
nights. Once or twice there had come
a break in the steady, rain, but iv an (
hour or so it only came down the hard
er, as though to make up for the time
It had lost. v~ . .:■
; He had wanted to take Bess over to
the Big rock, -where they had first
met- th° summer before, and there
make the avowal of love that had hung
.trembling upon his" lips ever since. He
had been able to take a whole month
the year before— four golden weeks fill
ed with sunshine aud love. ' ;>-.
Then Bess had gone to Europe as
companion to a rich relative, and Just
as she returned Curtis Brooks had been
called to South America on a matter of
great importance. They had corre
sponded with such regularity as their
uncertainty of ' movement permitted,
but there had been no opportunity for
a proposal, and now their waking time
was divided between the parlor and
the dining room of the old farmhouse.
Seven days of rain had got on
Brooks' nerves. With his whole en-
IS A MOMENT HE WAS ON BIS XNEE3 BB
SIDB TTTTR.'
Kgy bent upon taking back to town
Bess' promise, the dreary round of
parlor life irritated him. ■ .
Dickie Langdon, who had been the
life of the stormbound party, had re
christened Willow farm the Ark, with
an allusion to the animals that went
two by two. The landlord was Noah,
tbe colored servants Ham and his
wife, and, with a sudden \ switch to
"Pinafore," Langdon has Insisted that
Brooks was Dick Deadeye because of
his disposition, and Brooks had not be
lled his nickname. It was not easy
even "for a patient man to sit quietly
and . see the hoped for opportunity
pass, and Curtis Brooks was not a
patient man.
All through those last weeks in Co
lumbia he could shut his eyes and see
the Big rock with Bess and himself
standing beside it just as tWt-y had
done the summer before. Now that he
was here he could not even see it from
the windows because of the curtain of
mist and rain. Tomorrow he would
have to return to town, and then there
was another long trip to Caregena.
The frown was still on Brooks' face
when he went down to breakfast.
Langdon's jollity irritated him, and
when they went back to the parlor
after the meal he was gloomy and
dispirited. Even Bess could not win
him out of himself, and finally he went
to his room to write some letters, he
announced.
Writing consisted in sitting before a
table with pen and ink and paper near
at hand and staring at the drenched
landscape before him. Even the ducks
had sought cover, for now the rain
was coming down in sheets. He could
scarcely sec across the yard, and, with
a groan at the lost vacation, he let hid
head sink forward upon his arm.
A light knock at the door had to be
twice repeated before he heard it
Bess stood in the hall, smiling as
though there was no such thing as
rain.
"Don't you want to go up and have
a look at the. Big rock this rt'ternoon?**
she asked. "I think it's going to stop
raining at last Anyway, I can wrap
up well. It would be a shame not to
see the old place before you go back."
"Bess, you're an angel," was all ho
could say. She laughed at the remark.
M lt would be more seasonal le to call
tt.e a duck," she reminded. "I'll be
ready at 4 o'clock."
She darted away, and Brooks, with
a new hope in his heart, caught. up a
pen and wrote the letters that he had
been trying to compose all the week.
Bess was prompt, and at 4 o'clock
they met on the piazza. The rain had
gone back to a light drizzle, but Lang
don affected to take a last farewell of
them and promised to try and recover
their bodies after the flood.
Boss gave him a saucy reply, and
they started down the road. It was a
hard climb up the steep side of the
mountain at the foot of which Center
ville nestled, but after the stuffy at
mosphere of the house the wet earth
filled the clean air with a fragrance
peculiarly Its own.
Bess drank deep drafts down into
her lungs. "I'm glad that we came,"
she declared. "It isn't so very wet,
and I did want to have you see Big
rock again."
"I was afraid that It would be wasb
«d away before we could get up here,"
he said, with a smile. "This has been
a nightmare week, Bess. What can
you think of the way I've been acting?"
"I don't blame you," she said softly.
"It must be horrid to have your only
week spoiled. But there is Big rock,"
she added as they came In" view of a
huge bowlder, relic of some glacial pe
riod.
. In clear weather they could see far
down . the " valley from . the ledge on
which the rock stood. Even now they
were given a glimpse of. green fields
and the darker tint of the wooded sec
tions, though the silver thread of the
river had become a leaden reflection of
the cloudy skies.
Brooks leaned against the rock, while
Bess seated heaself upon a smaller
stone. : . For a moment neither spoke;
then Brooks turned to her.
"It was my one wish to come np
here,'! he said. "Do you remember last
summer meeting me here?" /
. "As though it were yesterday," she
answered. "I. had been «lay dreaming
In the shade of the rock, and you came
crashing through the bushes. I was a
little frightened, I remember."
"I wanted to come back here," he
said reflectively. "I had a foolish no
tion that r should be more fortunate If
I spoke In the shadow of the Big rock.
I wanted to ask you to marry me, Bess,
but I don't suppose you would dare
marry a chap who had shown such a
temper as I have In the' past few
days."
"Why don't you ask and find out?",
she suggested demurely. ' •-';/»-
In a moment he was upon his knees
beside her. He had given up all hope
as the long wet days wore upon his pa
tience. He had, not supposed that she
would trust her future to him. Now
that she had spoken he poured out' his
love In a torrent of speech, oblivious
to all else. For a quarter of an hour
he gave heed to nothing save the sweet
face before _ him, looked at J nothing
save the; tender eyes, now so full , of
love. ' Then she gently, disengaged her
self and pointed across the valley.
Far In the west the sun was showing
through a rift in the clouds, lighting
with prismatic splendor the arch of a
rainbow. "Life Is like that, dear," she
said f gently. "There must . be some
stormy days that we may better ap
preciate the sun." ' :;
"And you are not afraid— even of my
temper?" :. .
"Of course not, you foolish, boy."
"Bess, ' he said impetuously, "I'm go
ing to try and have very few storms.
I know how hideously unpleasant they
ore. All this week I've been growing
more and more certain that you would
never have me, and all the time yon
were looking for the rainbow."
"Love Isjthe pot of gold that Is burled
at the foot of that sort of a rainbow,"
she said, with a smile. .
"And, unlike the others, we have
found the gold,", he exulted. ,

DOGS IN BAGDAD.
Why They Do Not Loot the Pond
Bazaars of the Town-.
Bagdad Is alive with more or less
hungry dog 3. How is it that such
packs of furies do not loot the bazaars
of the town? The explanation' is as
simple as it is ' Interesting. The Bag
dad shop fronts are absolutely open.
'The goat and mutton carcasses are
hung where every dog that runs can
reach them. But time out of mind
the first glance of a dog's eye toward
forbidden- dainties has been .visited
with the swift descent on him of a
cudgel or r a hatchet. ~/.' :
On.one, 4 of, a series of marches paral
lel with the Euphrates I chanced to
meet a desert horde whose greyhounds
are In high repute. Buying a brace
of saplings, I took them on with me,
lodging them in the tent and doing
everything that was possible to make
them feel at home.
Surprising to relate, they obstinately
refused both food and water. The re
mains of a venison pasty seemed at
once to attract and repel them. A pan
of water appealed to them even more
strongly, but they would not go up
to it
j After a time a Persian muleteer ex
plained the mystery In a twinkling.
No sooner did he upset the water and
toss the viands on the ground before
them than the silky eared ones ran in
like Trojans and made up in a few
moments for a day's fasting.
Accustomed to lap from ! the' river,
from lrrigatlonal channels and from
sheots of surface water and reared
among people who do not use tables,
they had been taught by many a buffet
to keep their noses out of cooking pots
and vessels of every description.
In Bagdad man and beast alike drink
of" the great river, j which also forms
the arterial common sewer of the city,
the place w.here clothes are washed
and the "Stygian wave" into which is
dragged every beast of burden when
It is not left to lie where it has-fallen.
The muddy bottom, with the water
ever receding, the' exposed surfaces
thick with impurities and the tropical
sun "sucking up all the Infections,"
must be a regular hotbed of miasma
and pestilence.
And yet, mlrablle dlctu, Bagdad is
not, as eastern cities go, unhealthy.
But let the reader imagine to himself
what the Bagdad of the foregoing
slight description would be like with
out the dogs that scavenge It. Refuse
animal and vegetable matter is largely
disposed of by the dogs, In situ.—Nine
teenth Century.
Concerning "Christian Names."
May cne hiterject a gentle protest
against tbe use of the phrase "Chris
tian name" in this connection? The
Romans said praeuomen. the French
say prenom. and we have used the
word "forename" for the last 365
■years. It is as Incorrect to speak of
the Christian name of a Jew, for ex
ample, as it would be hopeless to ex
pect ii Christmas card from a Jewish
rr.bbi. Again, the middle name of a
Roman was his gentile name— that of
his gens. On the surface, what a pret
ty confusion of ideas It would have
been to have spoken of the name as at
once gentile aad Christian!— London
