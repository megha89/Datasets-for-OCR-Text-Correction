TUOLUMNE COUNTY.
Independent. Sonora. April 14, KM*.
Had it not: been for the presence of
miod exhibited by the engineer of th«
Dead Horse j mine. Summersville,"' last
Sunday, the country's long; list of un
derground tragedies would have been
added to by six. As it was, two min
ers wore considerably hurt, thougti
both feel satisfied to get off as they
did; and are certain . that all bands
would have gone whizzing through the
thousand feet intervening' between
them and the bottom of the shaft had
it not been that tho man at .the brakes
showed the stuff a' hoistings engineer
should be made of.
The day shift was being hoisted but
of the mine as rapidly as possible jafter
6 o'clock in the . afternoon and the un
lucky trip was made when, five miners
were on the skip and one more, Ben
Moffatt, riding the cable directly
ahead of it.
All was going well and the .400 foot
station had just been- passed, when all
of a sudden the big reel ' shaft snapped
like, a pipe-stem, and the skip with its
human cargo darted . back, i The sud
den jerking of the cable threw Moffatt
from his position, and he pitched down
the incline after the disappeared skip.
C. D. Hitchcock, one of the. miners, re
alized at once that an accident had hap
pened and reaching out seized tho bell
cord with both hands, jHe bad failed,.
however,' to take into consideration
tho frightful speed at which the run
away was making the descent, and as a
consequence the flesh was torn from
the palm of both his hands clear to the*
bone. Engineer C. Dunning was hoUt
lnjr t.V)ft fTT* n — ""'•afiilly^ — as — iKu^i hiw *:u*~
tom, when the shaft gave way. The
cable had been given such a jerk that,
it was ■ unwinding from the drum at a
rate which meant that unless some
thing was done quickly, the miners
would soon be in candle-boxes waiting
for the Coroner. Instantly he
slammed on the brakes, when both
clutch and auxiliary worked despite
the disarrangement of the machinery,
and in just fifty . feet the . skip was
.brought to a dead stand-still. A mom
ent later Moffat banged up against it.
Both the injured men are under the
care of a physician, - Moffatt being con
fined to his bed. iHe is bruised from
head to foot, with the possibility that
his injuries may develop into some
thing serious. Hitchcock is apparent
ly the worse hurt of the two. Where
he seized the bell-cord for six feet it is
coated with the flesh from bis hands.
The shaft in which the accident took
place is over 1500 feet deep. Werk at
the Dead Horse .is suspended until the
machinery can be repaired.

CONVENTION PREPARATIONS
Republicans to Meet at Los
Angeles.
SATISFACTORY ARRANGEMENTS ARE GUARARTEED
The Convention Is to Be Held In the
Hazard Pavilion Which Will ,
Seat Five Thousand.
Los Angeles, Cal., April 12, 1000.
When the Bi-ennial session of the
Convention of the California League of
the Republican Clubs that meets in
Los Angeles April .27th and 28th t;ball
have' closed, the hands of the Hepubli
can party of the State will have been
strengthened. So much * enthusiasm
exists in this Presidential year through
out California, and. so gratifying are
the reports that come to the Los Ange
les Executive Committee that has the
arrangements for tbe. Convention in
charge, that the prediction long since
made this Convention would prove the
largest club gathering in the history of
of the State and the most successful
Convention of the League, will be veri
fied. - ,--
In order to meet this emergeucy in
response to the request for the Repub
lican workers to come to the Conven
tion City of the Southland, the Execu
tive Committee has devise"! every
method of entertainment that will con
duce to tho pleasure of the 7500 dele
gates, with families, that, are expected.
The citizens of Los Angeles, without
regard to party, have patriotically re
sponded to the- call for funds to meet
the necessary outlays that a conven
tion of this magnitude entails. There
fore, the Executive Committee is able
to say that every item of expense for
Convention Hall, music,' decoration,
headquarters, badges, etc., will be
in«t. and that delegates will not be
called upon for a single dollar to meet
any exponst* l , much lerfs a deficit. '
The Convention will b« held in Haz
ard's Pavilion, that, is capable of com
fortably •„ seating S,OiM) persons., .The
decorators, using as adjuncts the trop
ical growths and flora of tbis section,
with Old Glory, bunting and shields,
have been instructed to turn the inter
ior into -a.- uiinature pagoda of colors.
1 For the convenience of. the working
force of . the Convention, two official
headquarters have been secured. The
Westminster Hotel/ will be devoted to
the needs of the State Executives,
while the working ■ force . of the local
Executivos and general headquarters
for all visitors, will be in the rooms of
the League, 180 South Spring street,
within easy reach of every hotel and
public building.
Too much' stress cannot be placed
upon the special railroad rate that has
been granted by the : railroads. ' This
rate is a one and one-third faro for the
round trip from any part of the State
to Los Angeles. The tickets for the
going trip may be purehai-ed north of
Mojavo and Ellwood on the certificate
plan from on and after April 12th. AH
railroad agents are fully informed as to
the provisions of the special rate, and
they will give all information when re
quested. In Southern California the
rate is an "open rate" and goes on sale
April 24th to April 28tb. These tick
ets can be secured by delegates and
their families as well as by their friends.
No distinction is drawn; the rate is
open to every one.
One guarantee is given that all dele
jrates and their friends will find ample
hotel accommodations. Los Angeles
pbsesses beyond 350 lodging houses and
hotels on the European plan. Accom
modations can be secured- from $1 a
day to as high a figure as one cares to
expend. Los Angeles, as a Convention
City, has never been taxed, and she is
well able to handle any crowd that may
come within her gates in response to an
invitation. This feature of, . material
welfare to man is no small element con
ductive to his pleasure; hence, the
convention management " feels that
nothing will be lacking in the way of
creature comforts.
As all clubs have received the neces
sary blanks for delegate representation;
the '-need is apparent that early re
sponse be made that the vast details of
the "convention may be ."speedily ad
justed. Any information desired can
be procured by addressing Major M.
T.Owens, Chairman Executive Com
mittee, Los Angeles, California.

An "American" Dnel.
During my residence in Heidelberg a
lanivntabli' and terrible • affair took
plaw that threw a profound gloom
over! the university and ■ the entire,
town. Two German students, having
quarreled, decided the earth was not
large enough for both of them to live
In and resorted to the . diabolical prac
tice called the "American. duel."
In a darkened room the two young
men drew lots, having sworn that he
who drew the black ball would commit
suicide. The , unhappy loser went to
his room and discharged a bullet Into
his breast but missed bis heart and
lingered for several days on his death
bed. His parents were summoned by
telegraph and besought him on their
knees to disclose the name of his an
tagonist but he steadfastly refused
and died with the secret In his breast
;. The students not only excused his
'conduct but praised his courage, and
■when his remains were taken- to the
railway station to be transported to a
distant city they accompanied the fu
neral cortege. with torches and. music.
The students claimed he was not a sui
cide, for be was killed In an. honorable
duel, and they maintained that his op
ponent was not accessory to his death
because he shot himself. I had many
arguments with them and never could
convince them of . their extraordinary

been ascertained that another stream
which rushes from the side of a bluff
eight miles distant in altogether an
other section of the country Is a con
tinuation of Lost river. This disap
pears In another sink, runs through an
underground passage a mile or more
In . length and finally empties Into
White river. ..'
It Is claimed the subterranean
streams do not follow a single channel,
but that the entire section Is honey
combed by a complex system of mains
and leads.
Lost river was evidently a surface
stream thousands of years ago. There
Is a well defined/deep rock bed leading
from sink hole to sink, and In freshet
season, when the volume of water be
comes too great for. the subterranean
passageways to carry, the overflow fol
lows the old river bed and Joins the
subterranean streams at : the "rises."
The old surface course Is overgrown
with I trees and briers and some of
these Indicate that the surface course
has not been used for at least cen
turies. Another evidence of its long
habit of following underground sinks
Is shown by the mound builders' earth
works thrown up at various points
where the river sinks away. Some of
these mounds are the finest found
north of the Ohio river.
Of the surface tributaries to Lost riv
er the most remarkable Is known as
Stamper creek, which gushes forth
from the sides of a bluff near Millers
burg. It has a rampant little current
which carries everything with It to a
sink hole a mile distant No one knows
exactly where.lt comes out but some
claim it makes its appearance at Spring
Mills. > six miles south. Here Lick
creek bursts out of the base of a hill,
Just in the rear of the mill. Farther
down stream Lick creek sinks away
from view, and then comes up and
flows to New Prospect where It emp
ties Into Lost river.
There are several other surface feed
ers which are quite as freakish. Near
them are found caverns through which
subterranean streams. flow. They are
filled with eyeless fishes and water ani
mals. In some the streams have a
swift current and are evidently part of
the Lost river system. At certain points
in tbe county the surface has caved in
and shows Lost river running under
ground to the depth of 100 feet How
the water Is again elevated to the sur
face is not known. The passageways
are through white rock, worn smooth
and white by the_water. % •.-/£.-
Those who have made a study of the
subterranean streams of Indiana and
Kentucky have advanced the theory
that away below the surface of In
diana—in at least the southern portion
—there is a secondary great system of
waterways and subterranean rivers.
Some geologists of note have concur
red in this theory. It Is known that
such streams do exist In the extreme
southern section. Wyandotte and oth
er caves owe their origin .to these
streams. Some years ago a subter
ranean stream was found running un
der Rush county, almost 70 miles
northeast The water can be heard
roaring through the passageways and
at times the course seems to be over
taxed. It evidently flows a great dis
tance from the northeast and probably
has Its source In the St Lawrence
river system. At English a flood re
sulted In the discovery of another lost
river. A new cavern was opened by
the water in Crawford county.
The attractiveness of Lost river and
its tributaries Is enhanced greatly by
the weird, wild scenery of Orange
county. There Is no section of the
state where the scenery Is more strik
ing and diversified.
Near the mouth of the river are the
famous West Baden and French Lick
springs, which throw off a water
brackish in taste and green cast In
color, which has become noted over
the entire world.— lndianapolis Press.

for over two years and that during that
time he got more out of my garden

Severe Punishment.
Sterling Is derived from the name by
which the dwellers In eastern Germany
were known in the twelfth and thir
teenth centuries. They were called
Easterlings v The purity not only of
their money was yery famous, but that
of their silver specially 'so, and coiners
and jj silversmiths were . fetched from
those parts to improve the quality of
our own manufactures.
So far back as 1597 two counterfeit
ers, who sold spurious silver articles
bearing a simulated royjil lion and the
goldsmiths' marks, were sentenced to
stand In a pillory at Westminster, with
their ears nailed thereto and with pa
pers above their heads setting forth
the nature of the offense for which
they were so disgraced. After this
degradation they were publicly march
ed to Cheapslde, put In the pillory
there, and had each one ear cut off,
finally being conducted back ,to the
Fleet prison and having to pay a fine
oif 10 marks each. '
It seems that In recent times the rec
ord price for Elizabethan silver was
£70 10s. per ounce. For old articles in
this metal the sum usually obtainable
ranges from £ 5 to £17 per ounce, ac
cording to the artistic workmanship

But for a niimberof years the Republcau party has met de

Peter, what kind of political sagacity do you call that. The
Republican battle line in the Second Congressional District
is strewn with 'wrecks 'caused by the egregious mistakes of

result in somethiug more than lip labor, and that steps will
bet aken then- and there which will lead in the direction of a

Secretary Gage does not pose as a humorist, hut the
manner in which he outwitted the New York newspaper,
which sought cheap advertising by bringing a Porto Rican
laborer under contract to that city, was a bit of official humor
that was relished the country over. Knowing the only object
in bringing the man from Porto Rico was advertising for the
paper, Secretary Gage exercised his authority and ordered
■ that the man be permitted to land in New York, and to work
under his contract until further notice, instead of refusing to
Sallow him to land and giving the paper the opportunity to
take the case into court. There is already a case before' the
VlL',3-. Supreme Court involving the question of whether the
Constitution extends to Porto Rico,- and if the decision in that
case is not conclusive, others can easily be made without' ad
vertising any private business. Secretary Gage deserves
credit for heading off that advertising scheme. The courts
are not maintained for advertising purposes, eveu though
theatrical stars do sometimes succeed in utilizing them for
self-advertisement. .

Horace Greeley expected the same thiug and he got it, but it
proved to be the most disastrous thing that ever, happened
to him. It will result the same in Dewey*s cas>e if he should
receive the* nomination.' In our opinion Dewey has no more
chance of being nominated by the Kansas City convention than
Grover Cleveland has. Admiral Dewey has taken advice
that will end in bringing him great humiliatiou. Bryanites
. are already adding gall to that humiliation by suggesting
that Dewey may possibly be given the nomination for Vice-

to reduce the internal revenue taxes, which were imposed on
account of the war with Spain. Our Democratic friends who
have been -predicting a deficit in the Treasury should pocket
the chagrin this excellent . showing causes them with good
grace. It is a bitter .pill, but they must swallow it. This is
a grand showing for Republican statesmanship and adminis

A GAUNT FAMINE IN INDIA
Reminds Us of the Needs of
Our Natives..
THE SAD PLIGHT OF THE RRIIONA INDIANS
Friendly and Industrious Arizona In
dians Are Destitute and Starv
ing.—lrrigation.
• Tho cry of distress has gone up from
famine stricken India and the civilized
world is about to reach forth a helping
hand to relievo in part tho misery
caused through lack of rainfall. Amer
ica as usual is foremost in such work,
and already many subscriptions have
been started and many contributions
received, v Probably every religious
journal in the land is receiving money
from generous Americans who have
been stirred to pity by the accounts of
the terrible wants existing in the far
eastern peninsula.
Yet, while ■ tho.-*e noble men and
women who assist the wretches of In
dia are putting a hand down into a
far distant land, they might probably
with the other hand draw forth a con
tribution or exert their influence in be
half of a people in our vory midst who
are reduced to want starvation, and
this, too, through the fault of the
great government of the ' free United
States. Sh
On the Gila Indian Reservation^ at
Sacaton, Arizona, Hive eighVthousand
Pimas and Papago Indians and here
they are known to have lived four
hundred years, probably, however,
owning the land farming it before the
white man set foot in America, their
annual crops of maize and vegetables
assured by the waters which they di
verted from the Rio Gila. Yet today
they stand robbed of their natural
birthright and reduced to starvation
through the rapacity of the white set
tler in draining the Gila above the Reser
vation, and the crimality of the Amer -'
ican nation in neglecting to provide for
them — Its wards.
Nor have these Indians been trouble
some to the government. On the con
trary they have always been real
friends of the whites and have render
ed invaluable service to our troops in
their campaigns against the treach
erous Apaches. Today ono thousand
of the Pimas have given up thoir sav
age customs and are educated mem
bers of Christian churches. By long
residence, occupation and use they
have a prior right to the water from
the Gila river wherewith they have al
ways irrigated their little farms. Does
not their case appeal strongly to every
American who is preparing to assist
the destitute of far lands? Is it not
the part of every citizen of this Repub
lic to use his influence In the direction
of making provision for these faithful
Indians.- A demand by American citi
zens to see simply justice done them
would be no expression of a slickly
spinless sentiment bewailing the cruel
treatment of the American Indians,
such as has overtaken treacherous and
murdering bands of Red men; for as
stated these natives of the soil have al
ways been friendly to the whites, their
boast being that their hands have
never been stained with whito men's
blood. '
The destitute condition of the Pimas
is no new story. Their poverty has
been increasing year by year and the
authorities have stood by and allowed
their irrigation water taken from
them. The Government Engineer
Corps has pointed out the solution
of the problem through the construc
tion of a storage roservoir on the Gila
which will supply water not only for
the Pimas and the Papagos, but for

government could then move to this
reservation and commence the process
of education and agricultural civiliza
tion. ■:':'•"
For years Congress has been urged
to authorize the construction of this
reservoir according to the otJioial sur
veys made, but yet no action has been
taken. Should Congress take this
question up now and act on it, the re
lief would be .immediate, for these In
dians are industrious and could be at
once employed on the work of con
struction. The government of India,
during famine years, provides "Relief
work." Why should not Congress in
this little instance pursue a liko meth
od?
The suffering in India touches the
generous American's heart, the pitiful
condition of the Cuban reconcentranos
set on foot measures for their immed
iate relief. Shall the condition of the
Arizona' Indians, brought about
through American injustice, go un
heeded, or will statesmen in Congress
take a rightful action? .

not new, this will be the first one given

teenth street, from Lto N streets. B<i
ing thus located in the center of the en
tire exposition, and all cross streets be
ing for the week closed, visitors, to
reach the Midway, will be compelled to
pass the booths of exhibitors. While it
is impossible at this early date to give
the exact nature of the different Mid
way attractions, the following area few
of the features that it is expocted will
ba secured. The Streets of Cairo with
Turkish and Arab gun spinners, sword
lighters and acrobats in games and
sports of the Oriental races; a German

specialty acts, singing, fancy dancing,
band concerts, etc. •■
RAILROAD EXCURSIONS.

CALAVERAS COUNTY-
Chronicle: S. E. Redmond, late of
the Metropolitan .Hotel at San An
dreas, and Mike Rigney went to El
Dorado last Monday where they will
engage in prospecting the Ritter mine;
They took a good supply of provisions
along and will "batch it" in a cabin on
the mine. They have some fine rock
in sight, and, as these j gentlemen are
full of push and energy, ' operatious will
be crowded as rapidly as possible. A
piece of rock from this mine that had
been left at the Metropolitan Hotel in
San' Andreas, was thrown out this
week by the present proprietor, as
only a slight speck of gold could be
seen on the outside. It was afterward
picked up and broken - open by L. S.
Pelton who was suprised to find that it
contained a large quantity of free gold.
The boys undoubtedly . have a good
thing and we wish them every success.
J. E. Burton, who is largely inter-,
ested in mining in these parts, has se
cured from Lee Vandel and S. C. Peek
a working bond for one year on their
"* property, the Nigger Hill quartz mine,
within this townsite. This mine is be
lieved to be an extension of the Moser.
The lead is in porpbpry formation and
- the rock is of a very high grade.
There is no doubt that ! the early-day
placer diggings on Nigger Hill came
from this lead. It is said that opera
tions will commence soon and that a
crosscut tunnel will be run to tap the
lead. . ,
The Eudora, situated below the Cal
averas grade, about one mile from the
West Point bridge, is owned and oper
ated by George J. Congdon." ' This
mine of late years has been known as.
the Hadler & Guy but since coming
Into the possession of Mr. Congdon it
resumed the ancient name Eudora,
under which it was worked in early
days by the Mexicans. The main tun
nel is in 210 feet and the face of it shows
a ledge a trifle over two -feet in width,
being of both free milling and rebell
ious ore. The free milling will be'
ground here and the rebellious — which
will 'yield about $35 per ton— will be
shipped to Selby's. Mr. Congdon is a
lucky prospector, and the Eudora is a
promising piece of property. .
Several men are at work clearing the
tunnels and putting things in shape on
■ the Lone Star mine, with the view of
that property resuming work at an
early date. This mine is too well
known in the history of Calaveras
county, to rewrite it at this time.
Until a few years ago it was the prop-
erty of the Hurley C?olO Mining com
pany of Wisconsin but lias sin^e passed

Prospect. Another rich strike has
been made in the Finnegan mine at
Carson this' week, and the indications
are good that another, big pocket will
soon be uncovered^ *.  *
At the Harris mine all is activity.
A sump is being sunk below the 400,
and next week a station will be cut at
that level j and the work of drifting
commenced.
: Reports from tho Demarest are very
encouraging. Good ore is being taken
out all the time and the quality stead
ily improves. Though not much work
is being done, save development work,
still the rock j takf n out and run
through the mill more than meets the
monthly expenses, leaving something
in the treasury for future contingencies.
Citizen: Two hundred tons of ore is
being taken I out of the Commodore
mine for a test run, which will be put
■through the mill of the Ford between
now and tho Ist of May. The result is
anxiously looked j forward .> to, ;and
should it turn out as expected a mill
will be immediately erected at the Com
modore.
The Kentucky mine has temporarily
closed down- pending the : arrival of a
new pump, the one In use now, not be
ing adequate for the amount of water
to be lifted. The work will go ahead
again as soon as the new pump is
plactnl.
TUOLUMNE* COUNTY.
Independent: The Jumper is said to
be turning out more gold than during
any other period of tho famous bullion
producer's history. The mining at
mosphere is loaded with prophesies
that a $500,000 clean-up can be expect
ed from ther- present run. This esti
mate may bo a shade high, but not
enough to seriously (interfere with the
figures when given approximately. |
Orders have been received from the
Goldwin Company to go ahead with
the new flume, and Captian ' McClin

He has since gone' to Lost Fox for the
purpose of making the necessary prep
arations for the resumption of work.

Tom and Phil Donahue are doing
very extensive development work on
their mine near ■La Grange. This

The Black Oak mine is looking better

Kibble is now making a scientific test of

Eatter Observance.
. A day of delightful weather followed
the brilliant dawa of Easter morning.
Regular and occasional church-goers
of Jackson attended divine worship,
and the Catholic, Methodist and Epis
copal services, were well patronized.
The season being well advanced flowers
were plentiful and the floral decora
tions were very elaborate. The music
was excellent, the best . talent in town
having been called into service. ' ' '
The sermons, as usual on such oc
casion, dealt with the crucifixion and
sufferings of the Savior, his death and
burial, and his final rise from the tomb
and ascension into Heaven. ■ • ■ '.-
Easter Sunday was as well observed
in Jackson, probably, as in any camp
along the Mother Lode. The various
ministers were in good form and deliv
ered effective and interesting dis
courses, and the large congregations
entered into the solemnity of the oc
casion with due religious fervor and
zeal. ' '•

Last Monday Mrs. Dr. Aiken and
Miss Madge Rust, while enjoying a
walk on the hill southwest of town,
encountered a huge rattlesnake near
the water ditch. This monster lord of
the grass and rocks was stretched at
full length on the rocks taking a sun
bath. The ladies, at first glance,
thought the old descendept of the
tempter of Eve was dead, but Mrs.
Aiken took a closer view, counted
nine rattles and a button, and saw the
lazy fellow's tongue in lively motion,
and reported the discovery to her com
panion. A retreat in good order was
at first decided upon, but the plucky
Indies reconsidered the motion and
opened battle with good California
nerve. If their aim had been a little
truer the enemy would have been
brought into camp. They made it
pretty lively for him, however, as it
was.

ploded in their camp fire .that was al
most deafening, and Lee Stevenson was
hit just back of the right ear a terrific
blow. The blood flowed so freely that
he mounted one' of the horses and came
to town, followed by his companion.
Dr. Endicott dressed the wound, which
is slight, and the young men returned to
camp. It is the opinion of Stevenson
that a giant powder cap was in the
wood they were burning and that It ex
ploded, a piece of it hitting him.

The Singular History of a, Peculiar
Q Character Who Located Wells For
Missouri Farmers and Juggled
V; With Trained Snakes. " " «: C
■■' -'Rev.-' Bill Scroggins was a character
'Itan border county of Missouri In 1844.
How he acquired the ecclesiastical pre
fix and : what be did under the title
•'were stories which used to be told in
•the farmhouses of what Is now known
• a« Cass county. ■<-
.They said he . had been! a snake
.. charmer when he was a young man,
that he' traveled about the country as a
sort of magician and that he showed
'farmers with his divining" rod where to
dig" wells?
7' The people of what was then a fron
tier country assembled once a year In
their respective communities and held
camp meetings. On one of these reli
gious occasions Bill followed the crowd
, with his bag of reptiles. The minister,
an old man whose face was like that of
a patriarch, told the story in a sermon
of Moses lifting up the brazen serpent
in the camp of Israel under the com
mand of Jehovah. The Missouri farm
- er who used to entertain travelers with
the recital' said that the congregation
was not particularly moved by the ap
peal, but after its delivery Bill Scrog
gtns got up and announced that he had
a bag of real, crawling, hissing reptiles
which he would exhibit after dinner
Just outside the camp ground, and he
claimed that be would show the people
some snake i tricks which would beat
the Mosaic story they had just heard, i
. In spite of the protest of the minister
the people turned out to the live snake
show, and Bill gave them an exhibition
which wan a great success. It is said,!
or it used to be said, that there wasn't 1
a snake t trick which Bill Scroggins' I
serpents didn't do. When the exhlbl-i
tion was over. Bill told the people that:
be. was a sort of missionary himself hi '
connection. with his business of locat-
Ing wells and that he would call on
each member in the evening and advise
.with them as to their spiritual and
worldly wants.
When he called, his first question
was, "Have you got a well? I . If the
reply was In the negative, and wells
were scarce, Bill informed the member
that be must have one located, and
then he opened his bag of snakes and
as they began crawling BUI lifted up
his voice and called the people to re
pentance. He told them the snakes
would do no harm If they (the people)
would give him the Job of locating
wells. r*~
It was a tax on human belief, but
the ' Missourlan who told the story
vouched for the truth of his assertion
that the people gave Bill more orders
than bo could fill In one season and
that -he broke up the camp meeting.
He, was the first heretic in the west,
although the word was unknown In
that country then. He became famous
and was In demand. Wherever he trav
eled he had his bag of trained snakes,
and he waxed fat and became Inde
pendent. ■ :
. Whenever there was any doubt about
the success of any movement the word
was passed that Rev. Bill Scroggins
should be summoned, i
' People In that section believed in
ghosts, as many more enlightened peo
ple believe in them In this day. There
was one ghost which had done a lively
business along the highway between
the county seat and a river known to
this day as Bear creek. It was the
custom of this ghost to chase belated
horsemen over the highway until the
ford at Bear creek was reached. There
the' chase stopped.' The ghost never
crossed the stream.
When the fame of Rev. Bill Scrog
gins had spread abroad, it was sug
gested, that he travel over the Bear
creek road and try his hand on the
spirit Bill accepted the call. He
made a number of Journeys before the
ghost materialized, and there were
people who began doubting the exist
ence of the ghost, while others cited
Rev. Bill as one who could overcome
anything, and by that token he bad
made the ghost take to the woods. The
community was equally divided.
However; the ghost showed up one
night In the midst of a storm and chal
lenged Rev. Bill to ride for his life.
The' snake ecclesiastic refused, and
there : was a contest in which Bill's
horse was killed, and he was left afoot.
The ghost got the bag of snakes and
escaped to the ford, where Bill over
took him on the following day, and the
contest was renewed. The ghost un
dertook to turn the snakes on Bill, but
they refused to act Bill got possession
of them and turned them on the spirit.
They drove the spirit into Bear creek
and across it, and the spirit fled, and
that was the end of the ghost In that
country.
' BUI returned in triumph to the coun
ty seat and told the story. It was re
ceived with some doubt but as years
slipped by and nobody was | chased
people began to believe Bill, and apol
ogies came In rather late. But BUI was
vindicated. Then he mysteriously dis
appeared.
Some years later a den of snakes was
discovered in what Is now Bates coun
ty. Mo., the adjoining county on the
south to Cass, and In this den was dis
covered the skeleton of a man. In the
opinion of many the skeleton was none
other than that of Rev. Bill Scroggins.
So well was his memory revered that
the . bones were collected from the
snake den, and when the first court
house was built in Cass county. It Is
said, they were placed In n box under
the cornerstone and were found there
years after when the old courthouse
was demolished.— Brooklyn Eagle.

SCIENCE OF DREAMS.
Results of si Series of Experiments
by m German Professor.
Sleep la not "the brother of death,"
as the poets have said from , Homer
to Shelley; but, oh the contrary, "sleep
1b the brother of life." '.So Professor
Baschlde asserts, -who, In' an article
In the Uaturwlssenschaftllche Runds
chau, gives an. account of his "experi
ments upon 36 dreamers." His sub
jects were of various ages, from 1 year
to 80 years.
In some cases his observations were
continued during the whole night and
In others for a great part of the night
He watched and • recorded every
change of physiognomy, every move
ment of the limbs and every speech or
sound -* uttered by the unconscious
dreamers. The depth of the sleep was
also carefully measured, while from
time to time the dreamers were awak
ened, but without their own percep
tion that the awakening was Inten
tional.
The professor obtained, as he writes
at length, the following results: (1)
We dream throughout the whole of our
sleep, even In that deepest sleep which'
we Imagine to-be . "dreamless." (2)
There Is an Intimate connection be
tween the depth of our sleep and the
character of our dreams. The deeper
the sleep the further back travels the
retrospect Into the past experiences of
life and also the more remote are the
contents of the dream from reality. In
a light sleep, on the contrary, the sub
ject of the dream. relates to the expe
riences and excitements of the day
and has a character of probability. (3)
In a comatose sleep the professor
thinks there may perhaps be no dream-
Ing. (4) Persons who assert that they
do not dream "are the victims of phys
ical delusion." . (5) Dreams of a moder
ate character remain longest In the
memory. The wilder the dream the
sooner It Is forgotten.— London News.
THE STONE OF GRATITUDE.
An Ola Roman Legend That Treats
of the Topaa.
The topaz Is called the stone of grat
itude, and the old ICo man books record
the foUowing legend from which the
stone derives this attribute: : /
The blind Emperor Theodosius used
to hang a brazen gong before his pal
ace gates and sit beside it on certain
days, hearing and putting to rights the
grievances of any of i his subjects.
Those who wlstied for his advice and
help. had but to sound the gong, and
Immediately admission Into the pres
ence of Caesar was obtained.
One day a great snake crept up to
the gate and struck the brazen gong
with her colls, and Theodosius gave or
ders that no one should molest the
creature and bade her tell him her
wish. The snake bent her crest lowly
in homage and straightaway told the
following tale:
Her nest was at the base of the gate
way tower, and while she had gone to
find food for her young brood a strange
beast covered with sharp needles ha"d
Invaded her home, killed the nestlings
and now. held possession of the little
dwelling. Would Csesar grant her Jus
tice?
| , The emperor gave orders for the por
cupine to be slain and the mother to be
restored to her desolate nest Night
fell, and the sleeping world had forgot
ten the emperor's kindly deed, but with
the early dawn a great serpent glided
into the palace, up. the steps and into
the royal chamber and laid upon each
of the emperor's closed eyelids a gleam
ing topaz. When Emperor Theodosius
awoke, he found he was no longer
blind, for the mother snake had paid
her debt of gratitude.— Exchange.
Doesn't Travel For Fun.
; Far from being the great autocrat,
the arbiter of things of magnitude, the
president of a railway system, be ii
great or small. Is a dealer In trifles,
with a consideration for everything.
Every accident large or small; every
occurrence by which the road is to lose
a dollar or to make a dollar, comes tc
the notice of the president The suc
cessful head of a railroad is the one
who considers the details. ' He Is the
man who makes the profits, and he ia
the man who has to face the music at
the directors' meeting.
I When you see the bright smooth
running traveling palaces of the rallr
way president trailing along behind
the long string of passenger coaches,
you can be safe In the opinion that the
occupant has not the softest snap on
earth. You can also rest assured that
if he is a success in his sphere he is
not traveling for fun.— Omaha World-

A Model of Joy.

finest and plumpest young pullet in the

JA grin overspread the shiny face of
Uncle Ephralm, but the artist was dis
appointed. The result was not quite
what he had expected.

morning," he went on, "I saw the fat

A PLUNGE TO DEATH.
SAM PATCH'S FAMOUS JUMP OVER
THE GENESEE FALLS.
The Last of a Sensational Series of
Darlns; Feats Which Might Have
Resulted Differently but For a Bot
tle of Brandy.
Nov. 13, 1829, Sam Patch lost his life
in jumping - from ! a scaffold 25 feet
above the brink of the Genesee falls
into the abyss below. He undertook
to Jump In all a distance of 125 feet
Of ■- course the whole \ population of
Rochester as well as the farmers from
neighboring villages were upon the
Bcene. The " fame of Patch had for
several weeks been a topic of conver
sation among the early settlers.
■ j Patch was born in Rhode Island In
1807. Soon after he removed to Pater-
Ban. N. J., at which place In 1827 he
was seized - with the jumping mania.
After giving several daring exhibitions
In New Jersey. he decided to try his
luck at Niagara ' falls two years later.
In October, ; 1527, he Jumped from a
shelving rock between Goat Island and
the gurgling waters many feet below.
A few days. later he startled the na
tives by Jumping from the old Fltz
hugh street bridge at dawn. He swam
under the water to a convenient hiding
place, where he had much amusement
in watching . several boats crowded
with people dragging for his body.
They were startled when he called
merrily to them, joking them for their
wasted efforts in his behalf.
On another mornlnfr he startled a
Rochester lad by jumping from the
brink of the falls to the rapids below.
If Patch had not reassured the boy, he
would have had half of the population
of Rochester dragging the water for
his dead body.'
With such a record It is no wonder
that on the morning of Nov. 13 aU the
muddy roads leading to Rochester
were thronged with people desirous of
seeing the wonderful Jumper. Even If
farmers were unusually busy la'secur
ing the last of their harvests they
found time to take a day or two off In
order to witness the feats of Sam
Patch. Several boats brought hundreds
of visitors In holiday attire from Can
ada. Oswego and Lewiston. Buffalo,
Canandalgua and Batavia were almost
depopulated on account of the exodus
to Rochester. The few taverns In the
city turned guests away, and many
had to camp out overnight.
Notwithstanding the raw, cold weath
er throngs of settlers lined the banks
below the falls. Although Sam said he
did not feel the cold weather, he was
pleased to fortify himself with a drink
of brandy tendered to him by his
friend, William Cochrane. Several of
the spectators contributed a unique
uniform. Dressed In white trousers
decorated with a black silk handker
chief tied around his body, surmounted
by a light woolen Jacket and skullcap,
Sam must have presented a grotesque
appearance.
After taking another drink from the
flask Sam made the following spt-ech
to the thousands of breathless specta
tors: "Napoleon was a great man and
a great general. He conquered armies,
and he conquered nations.. But he
couldn't Jump the Genesee falls. Wel
lington was a great man and a great
soldier. He conquered armies, and he
conquered nations, and he conquered
Napoleon, but he couldn't jump the
Genesee falls. That was left for me to
do, and I can do it and will."
Although Sam Patch could Jump the
Genesee faUs when he was sober, he
could not do it when he felt the effects
of the brandy. Owing to this fact he
met bis death when he took the jump.
When the thousands of silent and hor
ror stricken spectators saw Sam strike
the water, they did not see him come
to the surface. His descent was so un
like his previous efforts, when he shot
like an arrow from a bow, that the
spectators were certain that he met his
doom when he reached the water and
the Jagged, piercing rocks beneath.
The spectators searched In vain for
the Jumper. The torches of the search
ers along the river bank and those of
the searchers who dragged the river In
boats lit up the river during the long
night hours. Amid the roar of the
cataract the sorrowing multitude shed
tears for the Jolly good fellow who,
like many others, loved bis bottle on
occasions.
Notwithstanding the rumors that
Sam Patch had been seen alive in
Rochester nothing was heard of him
until St Patrick's day, when his body
was found In a cake of Ice near the
mouth of the Genesee. His remains
were buried In the cemetery at Char
lotte. Although it had been the ambi
tion of his life to Jump London bridge,
he met his death In the Genesee. The
feats of Sam Patch filled the newspa
pers for weeks, and although such
poets as Mrs. Slgourney wrote poems
dedicated to his memory no monument
has been erected In commemoration of
his feats.
Indeed, the event produced a pro
found Impression upon the people of
those days. On the following Sunday
the preachers In Rochester and neigh
boring towns could not say enough
against the evils of Jumping. Some
even went as far as Joslah Blssell, who
told the pupils of the Third church
Sunday school that because they saw
the fatal leap they were accessories to
his death and were murderers in the
sight of God.— Rochester Herald.

NEVER ATE FOREIGN MEAT.
It Doesn't Pay to Be Too Sure Until
One Knows All the Facts.
A certain Major Brownjonea, who
made It his boast that he never allowed
American or colonial meat to be served
at bis table, recently • visited an old
comrade In Liverpool. One night at
dinner a most delicious saddle of (ap
parently) Welsh mutton appeared, to
which the major did ample Justice.
"Ah," he observed, "I wish that my
butcher In London would send me stuff
like that and yet he deals only in the
best British meat"
"Well," said his friend, "as a matter
of fact you have been eating New Zea
land mutton. But it's only fair to say
that I get it from a friend who Is a
large wholesale Importer."
"By Jove, . you don't say boY ex
claimed the guest "I wish he'd tell
me where I can get the like in town."
"We'll go and see him tomorrow,"
said the host The visit was duly paid
to the meat monger, who smiled when
he heard the Londoner's eulogy and
explanation.
"Tell me," he returned after listening
to the epicure's remarks, "In what part
of London you reside, and I dare say I
can give you the address of a retail
butcher who will supply you with ex
actly the same sort of mutton as that
which you like so much." The major
handed him his card.
"Ah," observed the Importer, "there's
the very man within two streets of
your house. We supply him with all
his meat Here's his address," he add
ed, handing a slip of paper to the seek
er after succulent joints.
The major read, the major started,
the major frowned, the major, truth to
say, cried vengeance, and no wonder,
for the address was that of bis own
butcher, who dealt only in home prod

The Bottle at Ship Launches.
Down to Charles ll's time It was cus
tomary to name and baptize a ship aft
er she was launched, sometimes a week
or two after. The old Tudor method
used for men-of-war was still in use.
Pepys' "Diary", shows that. The ship
was safely got afloat after which some
high personage went on board with a
special silver "standing cup," or "flag
gon" of wine, out of which he drank,
naming the ship and pouring a libation
on the quarter deck. The cup was then
generally given to the dockyard ship
wright as a memento.
When did the present usage of nam
ing and baptizing a ship before she is
sent afloat come In? 1 trace. the last
explicit mention of the old method to
166-1, when the Royal Katherine was
launched (see Pepys). The first men
tion of smashing a bottle of wine on
the bows of an English man-of-war
that 1 have found Is In a contemporary
newspaper cutting of May, 1780, de
scribing the christening of H. M. S.
Magnanime at Deptford, but nothing is
hinted that It was then a new custom.

To Fly In loir Dreams.
There Is a peculiarity about the flying
dream that seems to be constant. Of
all those whom I asked about the mat
ter and 'who are conscious of the flying
dream at all not one has ever known
himself to make any high flights In his
dreams. One always flies low, with a
skimming manner, slightly, but only
slightly, above the beads of pedestrians.
' And one's critical attitude in a dream
toward one's own performance is al
ways interesting to note, both in re
gard to this particular class of dream
and e»en more toward one of the other
classes. It is an attitude that Is well
brought out in "Alice In Wonderland,"
where Alice Is made to exclaim or to
think while she is falling, "How brave
they wIU all think it of me at home not
to mind a great fall like this!"— Lon
gman's.

"Maria, did you read about that Phil
adelphia woman who was cured of her
mental troubles by fasting 45 days? I
believe such a treatment would cure
that unhappy temper of yours."
"Yes, it would make an angel of me.
Is that what you would like, John Bil
lus?"—Exchange.
