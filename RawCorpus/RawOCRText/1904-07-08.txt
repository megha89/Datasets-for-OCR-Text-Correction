The Amador Ledger.
A WOMAN'S REASON
[Original.]
There was enough of incident con
centrated in the wedding day of Dr.
Dmitri Urbanieff and Katharine. Tons
kol, two young Russians of the mid
dle class, for a whole lifetime. Ur
banieff had returned from his medical
studies in Paris with a light heart, for
Katharine was expecting him, and they
were to be married soon after his ar
rival. :-? f* >
He found domesticated in the home
of .Katharine's father Count Alexie
vech, who had some months previous
appeared in the village near by and
*who had brought a letter of introduc
tion to Tonskoi. For what he came
and how long he proposed to stay he
gave no information. Dmitri, when he
found the young man so intimate with
the family of his sweetheart, was trou
bled, but he soon made the discovery
that Katharine did not like the count
and this reassured him. Why she did
not fancy her father's guest was a puz
zle, for the doctor could see plainly
that the count seemed to desire her fa
vor. When Dmitri asked Katharine
for a reason for her prejudice she gave
him no better one than that Alexievech
was "cross eyed." Dmitri laughed at
this feminine reason and thought no
more about the matter.
The morning of the wedding day
brought a shock to the community. A
Sozen persons in the vicinity were ar
rested, and the most harrowing fea
ture was that the young doctor, who
was to have been married in the even
ing, was among them. The prisoners
instead of being given a trial were hur
ried off to Siberia^ Count Alexievech
appeared to be as surprised and indig
nant as any one and volunteered to
start at once for St Petersburg, where
he claimed to have Influence, to pro
cure the doctor's release. Dmitri was
earnest in his gratitude and begged
the count to. strain every nerve to free
him before It should be too late. Kath
arine could only cling to her lover, de
spairing of ever seeing him again.
After her lover's departure she passed
a few hours in an agony of despair.
Then suddenly a desperate resolve took
possession of her. She distrusted the
count's promise. Shortly previous to
the wedding day he had left her fa
ther's house and taken rooms in the
village. Katharine ordered a drosky
and drove. to his rooms. Instead of
sending for him to come down she ran
upstairs and knocked at his door. She
found him walking the floor, j
"Why are you not on the way to St.
Petersburg?" 9he asked.
' "I was too late for the 10 o'clock
train. There is no other till tomorrow."
I "There is a train on the other road at
4 this afternoon. You have only to
drive five miles to it to catch it."
"Eh? Are you sure? I don't believe
there is time."
"There is. time. Come. I have a
drosky below. I. will drive you my
self."
. The count began to busy himself
with preparation, making a great deal
of fuss while doing very little. Katha
rine saw his revolver lying on a table.
"You will need this," she said, taking
it up and thrusting it in a pocket of
her dress. "Come, we have no time to
spare." ,:. .;
Alexievech, cramming some brushes
Into a bag, accompanied her downstairs.
They got into the drosky. Katharine
seized the reins and drove away as
fast as the horse would carry them.
; As they were ■ passing through a
wood Katharine complained that her
fingers were numb and asked the count
to take the reins. He had no sooner
done so than he felt something hard
pressed against his neck and heard the
click of a pistol.
"Fiend," said Katharine, "I know all.
You are one of the chiefs of police and
have been ferreting out this plot. You
have implicated Dmitri to get him
out of the way the better to get me
into your clutches. I hate you, and I
am going to kill you."
■ '.'Katharine! For heaven's sake, of
what are you accusing me?"
"Write an order for the release of
Dmitri or I fire."
"But I have no authority."
"Write."
The count who had by this time
caught a glance of the girl's desperate
face, took out his notebook, tore out
a leaf, wrote the order and gave it to
her.
"Drop the reins and get out of the
drosky," she , said. He obeyed, and
Katharine, whipping up the horse, was
soon out of sight
She knew that k the route the prison
ers had taken was the one she was on,
their conductor Intending to take them
on the train she had proposed to the
count to take, She soon overtook the
party, produced the order, which was
respected, her lover got into the drosky
and they drove homeward. When ap
proaching the village they saw the
count ahead of them. He was walking
with his head bent down on his breast.
When they came up to him he looked
up as though in a dream. Dmitri got
out of the drosky and demanded satis
faction for the wrong that had been
done him. The count looked at Kath
arine with a hopeless expression, ask
ed her to give Dmitri the revolver
and bared his breast Dmitri turned
away, got Into the drosky and, without
a word from him or Katharine to the
count, drove on.
At the hour that had been announced
for the wedding the bride and groom
were ready, and, as the news of Dmi
tri's release had spread like wildfire,
the guests were assembled. The cere
mony passed as quietly as had been
expected.
When the bride and groom were
alone together Dmitri asked:
"Katharine, how did you know the
man was the cause of my arrest?"
"I didn't like the squint in hlfl eyes,"
was her confident reply.

PREJUDICE
KEITH GORDON
Copyright, 1903. by T. C. McClure
"No," said Constance in a tone of
unshakable conviction as she lay, hei
chin propped upon her hands, amid
the subdued richness of the oriental
pillows. "No; I might love a convict 01
I might love a Hottenot, but a widow
er, never!"
Her cousin, Mary Singleton, a prac
tical young woman more given to Jests
than sentiment, eyed her curiously, but
did not speak.
"Just fancy," Constance continued,
with scornful derision, "being a man's
second choice, listening to a rehash
of his first lovemaking! Gracious!".
Her tone implied that the thing was
well nigh unimaginable, but her cousin
only laughed a bit skeptically and took
the other side of the question.
"Do you mean to say that because
a person has loved once he — or she,
for that matter — cannot love again
without feeling that it is a rehash of
the old love?" she asked, with a yawn!
"My dear girl, you're all wrong! The
second love is simply a different mat
ter."
"The average human being," she
continued shrewdly, "is capable of a
good many loves. I don't at all believe
in these one love individuals — the sort
who mourn forever, you know. That
sort of . thing is simply emotional
poverty." , : \0;
Having delivered herself of this
worldly observation, she glanced at the
clock and began to coil up her loosened
hair in a .way that signified that it was
time that she went to her room to dress
for dinner.
"Soulless creature!" taunted Con
stance, with an indulgent but gently
superior air. "Defend widowers if
you choose, but none of them for me!"
"You girls with fine sentiments,"
Mary retorted teasingly, her hand on
the doorknob, "are just the ones to
look out for." And she passed out,
smiling, into the hall. A moment later
she opened the door again and, thrust
ing her head into the room, said in an
enigmatical manner:
"By the way. Con, be sure to tell
Douglas Stane that when he asks
you!" Then, before her cousin could
reply, she vanished, slamming the door
behind her. . :■■;•-
Constance stood In the middle of the
room for a moment perfectly motion
less, wondering if she could have heard
aright Douglas Stane a widower!
For of course that was what Mary
ment. Douglas Stane a widower! And
in the four months in which they had
been growing daily fonder of each oth
er she had never before heard the fact
mentioned.
With a quick movement she glided
toward the door and locked It. Then,
with her hands clasped with painful
tightness, she stood in the middle of
the room and repeated with growing
Incredulity: "A widower! Douglas
Stane a widower!"
"It can't be true— it can't be— it
can't be!" she protested, with a moan.
His likeness .rose before her — tall,
broad and a bit stern of face. Then,
going hot and cold by turns, she sank
down upon the divan once more and
burled her head in the pillows.
"Her lover!" That was what her
heart cried out, and, thougrL,she would
not permit herself to say iv there was
a wild, sweet bliss in the thought
Subtly she had known it almost from
the first But a widower!
She shivered now at the very remem
brance of things that had once thrilled
her— the unconscious softening of his
keen eyes when they met hers, the
elusive but unmistakable tenderness of
his tonch when he helped her over a
rough place or held her wrap. Time
was when the caress of his glance
made her blood tingle. Now she re
membered it with a sort of loathing.
Had his eyes not softened for some
other woman?
Thus she wrestled with love and pain
until the striking of the clock reminded
her that the dinner hour was at hand-
Jumping up, she began to dash cold
water over her flushed face and wet
eyes, while she tried to steady her
surging emotions.
"Everything went wrong," she apol
ogized when she appeared at the din
ner table rather flurried and breath
less. "Couldn't get my hair up right,
hooks wouldn't hook, and buttons
wouldn't button."
Her cousin smiled.
"Methinks the lady doth protest too
much," she thought to herself.
"Dick Just telephoned," she announc
ed, feeling rather small and guilty as
she noted Constance's flushed face and
feverish eyes. "He and Douglas Stane
are coming up after dinner to take us
down to the Spouting Rock."
• Constance opened her lips with the
evident intention of declining, but be
fore she could speak her cousin con
tinued glibly:
■ "I Just accepted for both of us be
cause I knew you would like to go."
Then she continued under her breath:
"Poor old Douglas! Wouldn't I like to
hear what she says to him! How shall
I ever make my peace with them. I
wonder?"
When, the dinner over, they sat on
the broad piazza in the twilight she
half regretted her prank and decided
fo speak, but before her good inten
tion crystallized into words Constance
spoke to her, and at the studied indif
ference of the latter's voice and the
marked ennui of her manner all her
love of mischief returned.
"I never before heard you mention
that Mr. Stane in a widower," she said,

patting her lips with one of her fingers
to discourage a yawn. ..'
It ','Didn't you?" queried Mary Inno
cently.' ' "Perhaps I never did mention
It" Then at the sound of footsteps on
the gravel she added rather; hurriedly,
"Don't lay It up against the poor fel
low, though. 1 ! v : v: - : ~
I ' Two dark figures were approaching
from the foot of the lawn. If Con
stance jumped at the conclusion that
•Douglas Stane was a widower just be
cause she had said, "Tell that to Doug
las Stane when he asks you," it was
her own fault
- Meantime that young lady's greeting
to Mr. Stane was a trifle stiff, but no
one but her tormenting cousin noticed
it. * The gentleman himself seemed ut
terly unconscious. He had determined
to learn his fate, and In the grip of
that mighty resolve all minor things
escaped his notice.
Mies Singleton seemed bent upon aid
log him, for she and her fiance were
lost to sight around a bend of the road.
Stane "Hoo-hooed!" after the manner
of the cottagers in the neighborhood,
but no answer came back.
"Deserted us already," he laughed,
his vplce a little shaken by the great
question that trembled on his lips.
"Let's hurry and catch up with
them," suggested his companion. '
"How extremely unflattering!" came
his answer. "I was Just longing to
have you all to myself."
He tried to speak lightly, but eager
ness vibrated in his voice. They had
emerged from the grove and stood at
the edge of the rocks.
"My dear, dear lovel" He took both
of the small bands in bis own and
stood looking down at her, struggling
to speak calmly.
"You know — you must know," he
went on eagerly, "that you are the only
woman on earth to me. How, I've
lived all these years without you I 'do
not know. I can't face life without
you any longer. I never knew what
It was to live until I met you."
A quick change came over Con
stance's face; even In the dim light
he saw it and wondered, and she
wrenched her hands away.
"For shame P she said hotly. "For
shame! Do you think any woman will
love you better for ignoring her— that
other— the one who in other years was
.'all the world' to you?" :
She stopped,' unable to go further,
because the tears were choking her.
A- look of blank amazement over
spread Stane' s face, and be stared at
her with eyes that were a concentrat
ed interrogation.
■ "Oh, It seems to me," she went on
passionately, "that If I were a man
and 1 bad once loved a, woman well
enough to marry her, and she had
died, I'd be. a little bit true to her
memory! If I wanted care, compan
ionship, whatever It is j that men re
marry for, I'd say so, Instead of pre
tending that I had never really, loved
before I"
Had she been less wrought up by
her feelings, she might have noticed
that during this tirade several expres
sions fluttered like shadows across her
lover's face. Astonishment gave way
to understanding, and that in turn to
a grim determination.
"I ■ see," he said slowly, but in a
voice whose ring mnde her look up nt
him with the conviction tlint he was
no longer a suppliant for her favor.
"You reject my love because"—
"Because you have been married be
fore," she finished stubbornly.
"Jenlous of a dead woman," he
mused, looking at her through eyes
narrowed to a mere silt. "All, me!"
Then, as tf the episode 'were closed,
he nskp'l i;uie>tl.v. "Shall we return to
the bouse?"
Slio felt suddenly terrified, bereft.
She had expected something very dif
ferent— expostulation — self justifica
tion. A mij itiy struggle was going on
within her. But above the din of con
tenrtln;: filings she board one clear
cry. "I lovo him! I love him!" and
slie held out her hands as beseechingly
as a child.
"You poor, silly little girl!" he
whisperod in a voice of great content
as.be swept her up In his arms, "Who
ever told you that absurd tale? But
I've proved to you that you would
have loved me even if I had been!"
Once There Win n Man.
Once there was a man who complain
ed that unworthy men were too fre
quently elected to office,
"Do you attend the primaries?" asked
Ills liPflrors
"Then you have no right to kick,"
they told him. "It is the duty of every
good citizen to attend the primaries and
see that the best men are chosen as
candidates."
Whereupon he began attending the
primaries.
He worked faithfully for the nomina
tion of sober, honest and reputable can
didates.
But it did no good. .
The other fellows turned out in great
er numbers and outvoted him, and bad
men were nominated and elected to of
fice as before. |
He felt that he had a right to kick
this time, and he complained again.
"Do you attend the primaries?" his
hearers asked him.
"I do."
"Then you ought to keep your mouth
shut," they said. "You are a part of
the crowd that nominates these bad
men, and you are responsible for them."

A favorite plant with the old herb
alists was satyrion, a name applied to
several species of orchis. As far back
as the days of the Roman empire it
was commonly supposed that the roots
of the satyrion supplied the satyrs
with food and prompted them to com
mit those excesses for which they be
came proverbial. Klrcher relates the
case of a youth who, whenever he vis
ited a certain corner of his garden, be
came so lovesick that he mentioned
this strange circumstance to a frfend.
On examining the spot It was found to
be overgrown with a species of saty
rion, the odor of which alone had the
effect of inspiring love.— Chambers'
Journal.
The Orchid.
The orchid is a peculiar plant, for,
strange as it may seem, there is no
distinctively orchid odor. One smells
like the violet, others like the rose, the
hyacinth, the daffodil. Orchids are the
monkeys, the mimics of the vegetable
world, in odor as well as form and
tint. No other flower resembles an or
chid, but orchids are forever aping but
terflies, pansies, boots, spiders, pitch
plants, birds and what not And they
are not absolutely certain to look Just
the same twice in succession. -
Photography.
Photography was discovered in this
way: Daguerre was lying on a couch
in his attic abode and saw a sunbeam
fall upon a spot in the darkened room.
He was startled to see the objects on
the street vividly portrayed in all their
colors— ln fact, a. panorama of the
incidents outside. He studied the sub
ject, and his search in the mystery
was the beginning of all that is beau
tiful in photography today.
Plenty of Rest Is Necessary.
The besf work, however hard, is al
ways methodical enough to permit of
timely rest and regular nutrition, and
the full recognition of this fact Is a
mere question of public utility which
•we hope to see more and more widely
admitted into practice. — London Lan

'The Aristocracy of "" Birth.
Why did the aristocracy of parent
age fall to hold Its own? Why did tt
die out in America : anA practically
speaking, in all the British colonies?
It had every advantage at the outset;
it held the Inside track. It failed be
cause two great laws of the universe
were against ' it-^flrst, the j laws of
arithmetic, and, secondly, the laws of
physiology. It violated the principles
of arithmetic because it required that
each individual or household should
have a distinct line of ancestors, and
it would thus be discovered in a few
generations that there were not nearly
enough ancestors to go round, leaving
people in the position of Mark Twain,
who declared that he had "no parents
to speak of, only a tether or mother
or so." It was contrary to the laws of
physiology, as shown by the deteriora
tion of one royal family after another

What the Jap* Call Japan.
A certain Japanese who has been for
some years a resident of Philadelphia
and who has many friends here was
speaking the other night of his own
people.
"Of course," he said, "we do not
call our country Japan. Ouz name for
it is 'Nippon,' or 'Sun's Origin,' indicat
ing its position in the extreme east
But when we speak of the entire em
pire we call It 'Dai- Nippon,' which
means 'Great Nippon. 1 "
The Jap's eyes twinkled.
"It is not," he meditatively conclud
ed, "uninteresting to ■ reflect that off
the eastern and western boundaries of
the greatest mass of land in the world
there should exist an Insignificant
group of islands inhabited in each case
by a people of very mixed origin and
very mixed characters, each of whom
expresses its defiance of its geograph
ical insignificance by the same means—
'Dai Nippon' and 'Great Britain.* "-

A good story of an old crofter who
appeared before the commission to ap
ply for a reduction of rent was recently
told at a meeting in Glasgow. The
number of cattle on the farm led Sher
iff Brand to observe that surely the
croft could not be In such a bad way
as Its owner would seek to show.
"Och," replied the old fellow, "you
should see the bit beastles." "What
like ore they?" queried the sheriff.
"They're as lean, sir, as Pharaoh's
klne." "How lean was that?" "asked
the sheriff, doubtless thinking that he
had cornered the applicant. But had
he? Not a bit. Like a flash came back
the answer, "So lean, sir, . that they
could only be eaten in a vision."
Shocked the Court,
A writer in "Law Notes," speaking of
the late John MacMahon, says: "Mac-
Mahon's style was painfully heavy, his
utterance a little thick, and he was en
tirely devoid of humor. His hearing at
times was not of the best, and for that
reason he thought it was the best poli
cy to agreejvlth any remark that might
be made-By??he Judge before whom he
was appearing, even though he did not
happen to hear what had been said.
On one occasion he was appearing be
fore a master of the rolls, who thought
that MacMahon was | arguing rather
elementary law for such a court as his.
'You are speaking as if I were a mere
tyro in the law, Mr. MacMahon,' said
the master of the rolls testily. 'Quite
so, my lord,' said counsel airily, pro
ceeding with his argument, oblivious
to and regardless of what the judge
had said."

HOW TO WIN A HUSBAND.
Woman's! sphere in this 20th century is
not limited any more than is man's. She
can occupy almost any business position
or profession, and yet the popular view of
womanhood is that she best fits the posi-
tion of wife and mother and head of the
household. Every girl should know her
heart and also know that her womanly
system is equal to the strain of marriage.
If a girt is nervous and irritable ten chances
to one it is due to some trouble peculiar to
womanhood.
Cupid has no place in a girl's heart if
she is nervous and irritable, feels dragged
down, worn out for no reason that she can
think of. The weak back, dizzy spells and
black circles about the eyes are only symp. ,
toms. Go to the source of the trouble and
con-ect the irregularity. Stop the drains
on the womanly system and the other
symptoms will disappear. This can be
done easily and intelligently. So sure of
it is the World's Dispensary Medical Asso-
ciation, the proprietors of Dr. Pierces Fa-
vorite Prescription, that they -offer $500
reward for women who cannot be cured of
leucorrhea, female weakness, prolapsus, or
falling of the womb. All they ask is a fait
and reasonable trial of their means of cure. 5

FRIDAY JULY 8, 1904
FISH AND GAME LAWS.
"It is*' not our intention in this
article to recite the Fish and Game
laws, neither do we intend to say
that there should be no laws for the
partial protection of fish and game.
But we are going to say, and say it
honestly, that rnaDy of the present
fish and game laws of this state and
county should never have been en
acted. Their provisions are un
reasouable and should never have
been adopted by a legislative body
iv a country where the fundamental
law of the land declares for life, lib
erty and the pursuit of happiness.
The dove law. is a farce. It was
gotten up .wholly in the interest of
the few as against the many. That
was demonstrated iv Jackson and
every other town\in the county on
the first day of July. One out of
every 25 men in Jackson was out
before sunrise and many of them
were the men who have been so
anxious to see that innocent boy or
man punished who was ignorant
of the exacting provisions of the
law, and went forth perhaps to pro
cure game with which to feed a hun
gry family or provide an appetizing
broth for an invalid sister or mother.
lit was just as cruel, just as inhu
man to kill a dove on the first of
July as on the first of June, for the
nests are full of young ones even at
the present time, and if the mother
bird is destroyed on July Ist the
helpless young ones will perish just
as quickly as though the parent bird
had been killed on June Ist. At no
other time during the summer sea
son have the hunters of the large
cities a better opportunity to hunt
than the first of July. : All work is
generally suspended on the 4th and
there was no more opportune time
for the open season to begin than on
the first of July when the profes
sional hunter can kill or cripple
them all within a few days. The
fish law is even worse. Fish are a
luxury, especially mountain trout,
but unless you can spare the time
and money to go and catch them
yourself you must do without. It is
not safe to even beg a dozen from
your friend who has them to throw
away. Your pockets may be full of
money, your children may be crying
for trout and your eyes may be rest
ing upon a hundred dozen or more
that may be thrown to the dogs; but
if you ask to buy a dozen, and suc
ceed in getting them, you as well as
well as the seller have committed a
crime that may. send you to the
state's prison for the remainder of
your natural life. No person can
buy or sell a trout that weighs less
than a half pound, and not one in
1000 that are found in our moun
taiu streams are above that weight.
The game laws are for a certain
class. Not the rich against the
poor but the professional hunters
against all others. Those who are
sworu to enforce the laws must do
so, but those who have the power to
create laws should scrutinize them
closely before putting their stamp
of approval upon them.
California at St. Louis.
From all accounts if one wants to
know something of California and her
wonderful resources he had best go to
St. Louis and observe the grand ex
hibit. It is 'said that the Governor of
the state knew nothing of his state un
til he went east and assisted in dedicat
ing the various departments of our
wonderful display. Some of our coun
ties have even surpassed our sister
states. Our wines, grains, fruits, etc..
are attracting the attention of visitors
from every quarter. Designs of all
kinds made of the products of our soil
are in evidence everywhere. Prune
horses, orange houses, wine and olive
oil monuments, raisins in every con
ceivable figure, marble . slabs, hewn
logs and logs in their natural state all
go to add to the varied resources of our
golden state. California never does
anything by halves, she knows how to
do, she has the resources to do with,
and we will not be surprised to hoar in
the end that she has not only fairly
outstripped every other state and re
ceived the first prize, but also a far
greater prize by adding to her popula
tion some of the most substantial farm
ing, elements of the world.
There is more catarrh in this section
of the country than all other diseases
put together, and until the last few
years was supposed to be incurable.
For a great many years doctors pro
nounced it a local disease, and prescrib
ed locai remedies, and by constantly
failing tocure -with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable. Science has
proven catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti
tutional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
Cure, manufactured by F. J. Cheney
'& Co., Toledo, Ohio, is the only consti
tutional cure on the market. It is taken
internally in doses from 10 drops to a
teaspoonful. , It acts directly on the
blood and muscous surfaces of the sys
tem. They offer one hundred dollars
for any case it fails to cure. Send for
circulars and testimonials.

Will Display California's Wealth.
The display of California's vaßt and
almost inexhaustible resources will form
one of the most attractive features of
the Triennial Conclave. Coming from
every part and section of the State, the
immense variety and wealth of the pro
duct will astonish the visitors from
abroad and be a revelation to many
Californians who have but scant know
ledge of the resources of the State out
side their own section. . Each county
and section will install .the exhibit of
its resources at the headquarters of the
Commandery stationed within its
boundaries, either some large hall or
in the parlors and reception rooms of
the hotel where the Commandery
makes its headquarters. In «ome cases
two or more Commanderies stationed
at distant places will share headquart
ers and exhibit and entertain jointly;
while in several instances Commander
ies stationed at distant places will share
headquarters and exhibit and entertain
jointly. While the display of Califor
nia fruit, flowers, grain and other pro
duce of field and farm, orchard and
vineyard, must prove very interesting,
for California leads the world in that
respect, the mineral exhibit from the
mother lode and other mining regions
will be not less attractive, especially to
those who have never seen the precious
metal wrested from the bowels of the
earth.
The Conclave is to be made the oc
casion for a general reunion of Sir
Knights who dwell far from their for
mer home, where they have been orig
inally knighted, and many interesting
meetings, after years of separation will
take place. :
There are thirty-nine flourishing
Commandries in the Grand Jurisdiction
of California, with an aggregate of 5,000
members, and nearly every one of those
will attend the Conclave and bring his
family with him. Thousands of others,
outside the Order, will take the advant
age of the low rates and go to San
Francisco, because they will be able to
see more in the metropolis of the
Pacific during the Conclave week than
they could possibly see during a year
at any other time. Californians roalize
that it is safer to show the wonderful
things which grow in California, when
telling strangers about them, and as
long as the strangers can not visit every
part and section of the State, will bring
the proofs of California's wealth right
to San Francisco that all may feast
their eyes upon them and go back to
their respective home to tell what they
have seen, and show the souvenirs they
will carry home with them.

N. S. G. W. Dance.
On Saturday evening, June 25th,
the Jackson Parlor gave a grand anni
versary ball, the order having been in
existence in Jackson 20 years. The oc
casion was a most enjoyable one and
was conducted in a manner that reflect
ed great credit upon those who had
the affair In charge. Not a man was
allowed to pass the outer door without
first procuring a ticket, and not a per
son who entered was allowed to smoke
without passing out beyond the outer
door. Tho rule was Btrictly enforced
and we are free to say that it was the
first time we ever attended a dance in
a mountain town where we did not see
congregated in some corner a lot of
boys or menpuffing away at cigars and
cigarettes. The time between dances
was taken up by the home boys in in
troducing the many strangers present
to the young ladies. One young man
from Lodi remarked in our hearing
that he was surprised at the unusual
attention paid to strangers. The music
was all that could be desired, j The
Stockton orchestra has the reputation
of furubhing nothing but first-class
music and they fully satisfied every one
present both as to quantity and qual
ity. The affair was not gotten up as a
money making scheme but simply to
cemmemorate the lodge anniversary.
The most that was hoped for was to
come out even. This the boys did and
are overjoyed with the congratulations
they have received upon the excellent
management during the entire evening.

Big Rattlesnake Held up a Stage.
A great big rattlesnake with body
coiled, rattles buzzing, head erect and
fangs sticking out in a threatening way
held up the southbound Redding and
Weavorville stage on Niagara hill Wed
nesday and Stage Driver Dick Heath
was compelled to climb down from his
seat and kill the rattler before the
stage could go by. It was the biggest
snake Heath had ever seen and- meas
ured four and a half feet in length, with
a body larger than a man's arm and
with eleven rattles and a button. The
rattles now ornament the desk of the
city editor of the Free Press. This
makes the sixth snake Heath has
killed on Niagara hill, but this is by far
the biggest of the lot.— Redding Free

NOTES FROM
GOLD MINES
Fremont-Gover. — The property
still remains idle and many of the men
who formerly worked there have found
positions elsewhere. We have not
heard just when the company contem
plate starting up.
Central Eureka. — The > June
cleanup was the largest reported .in
the county for months. $47,000 in one
month is good enough for any mine.
South Eureka.— We hear that the
mill started up last Monday and will
make an extended run on good milling
ore. '
WILDMAN-MAHONEY.— The work of
taking the water out of the Lincoln
shaft is progressing rapidly. Work
will begin on the tunnel as soon as the
IV'lldt 1 jc (lilt
water is out.
Kennedy.— The addition to tho mill
is being pushed forward with all possi
ble haste. Mr. H. G. Murray has
charge of the construction work.  •
ZeilA.— Aboout 60 men were laid off
last Wednesday, and tho remaining
crew will be put to work repairing the
shaft. There is some talk of their
sinking a short distance. ■
Treadwell Mine. — A correspoud
ent of the Ledger while on his way
from Sutter Creek to Volcano Saturday
stopped a short time at the Treadwell
miue and through the courtesy of fore
man Joseph Capella was shown through
the mill-building and taken to the re
cently uncovered ledge about 150 yards
distant where we saw one of the nicest
looking formations that we have ever
seen in many a day. The foreman is a
good practical miner and pronounces
this one of the most perfect ledges that
he has ever seen. During our stay we
were introduced to the owners of the
property who had arrived on the
strounds just a short time before. They
are Judge M. J. Gordon, of Spokane,
H. Eaton and Sidney Drake, of Seattle.
Superintendent Schenck was busy
showing these men the recent develop
ments in the mine, and they expressed
themselves as more than pleased with
tho property. The 5-stamp mill start
ed up on Tuesday, in the presence of
the owners who had come from Wash
ington State to witness the dropping of
the stamps on the first crushing to be
made under the present management.
The mill is a substantial one and re
flects great credit upon the person who
had charge of its erection. The com
pany congratulated superintendent
Schenck and foreman Capella upon the
amount and character of work done in
so short a time, and after witnessing the
starting up of the mill left Friday morn
ing for Washington ' feeling that they
had made no mistake by investing
their money in Amador County.

The 4th in Jackson.
No attempt to publicly celebrate the
nations birth-day t was made by the
citizens of Jackson. - Every person
who could secure any semblance of a
rie', riding pony or jack, went either to
Plymouth or to Mokelumne Hill. Some
even walked to attend the dance. Those
who remained in town spent the day
socially. All places of business were
closed in the afternoon excepting those
that had fire works to sell and the
saloons. During the day the children
kept the town noisy by tho burning of
firecrackers, aud in the evening many
of the oliii-r ones leDt a patriotic hand
and kept the bombs exploding until
quite a late hour. We noticed that
the foreign population of the town spent
a considerable sum in the purchase of
fireworks. By doing this they taught
their children a lesson on patriotism
that will not soon be forgotten. In
terest in an historical question must be
created in some unsuspecting way.
The roar of cannon, the sound of the
bugle, the waving of Him Hair and the
shouts of assembled niulu'.uries create
in the minds of the younger generation
a desire to know what it all means.
The history of the Revolution is taken
down and and the reader at once be
comes filled with his importance
as a successor to one of thoso who
sacrificed so much for us and at once
becomes a true patriot, and a teacher
of patriotism to those who follow after
him. Jackson should celebrate July
4th 1905. The young people of the town
need the inspiration that it would give
them. The matter should be. taken
up in earnest early in the spring and
pressed to a successful isaue.
Volcano Small-pox Case.
Quite a number of bills were present
ed to the Board of Supervisors Monday
by parties who assisted in one way or
another in taking care of, or furnish
ing supplies to John Harker Jr. While
suffering from small-pox in Volcano.
Most of the bills had been O. K'd. by
the county health officer, and the
District Attorney passed them up to the
supervisors without his signature.
Some members of the board first re
fused'to sign, not being able to under
stand how it was that it took two white
men and a chinaman to care for the
patient. County clerk Culbert finally
suggested that it took the chinaman to
watch the sluk man and the two white
men to watch the chinaman. This
1 cleared matters a little and most of the
bills were signed. There wore two bilh
for similar articles one from Clute's and
one from L. Crssinelli & Bro. but sup
ervisor Grillo explained that one was
for the Chinaman, the other for the
patient and they were allowed. Mr.
Frank Clute of the St. George hotel
furnished the food the patient and at
tendant ute and his bill was also scru
tinized. The sum total was between
$75 and $100 which at first glance seem
ed to be exorbitant, but as the disease
was kept from spreading it may be
very reasonable after all.
The 4th in Plymouth.
The 4th in Plymouth was a decided
success. Every person who went from
Jackson speaks in praise of the satis
factory manner in which the program
was carried out to the letter. The
amusements pleaded old and young
alike, and tho people of the town
showed by their every endeavor that
it was carried out on patriotic lines and
not as a money making scheme.
Although the crowd was larger than
expected the church ladies and hotel
proprietors had prepared for just such
a surprise, and found no difficulty in
feeding all. The oration by Hon. U. C.
Rust was full of patriotic sentiment and
evoked frequent applause from the at
tentive listeners. The singinsf was
greatly appreciated and the band kept
playing from early morn till late at
night. The horso-race was one of the
best ever seen in the county. A Plym
outh horse won by a scant margin from
Greenback, owned by Mr. Reeves of
Amador. The fire-works, horribles
and balloon ascension made the early
evening an enjoyable one. The dance,
from a financial standpoint, was the
greatest success of all, but the" hall was
so crowded that it was almost impossi
ble to dance. We regret that the
scarcity of conveyances prevented
many of our patriotic citizens from
being present. We are unable to give
the names of winners of the principal
event. May Amador county have
many such celebrations that her peo
ple may become better citizens thereby.
Death of I. IT. Neeley.
Mr. Isaac Newton Neeley, who for
merly conducted the Enterprise livery
stable in Jackson, but of late years a
resident of Milton, died at his home
Friday evening. surrounded by friends
and relatives. The immediate cause of
death was a rupture of a blood vessel
on the brain. Mr. Neeley was born in
Pennsylvania 73 years ago, and came
to California and settled in Volcano,
Amador county, in 1850. During his
stay in Volcano he married and from
that union he leaves a son and three
daughters to mourn his loss, his wife
having dlod several years ago. Later
he married Mrs. M. F. Walker, mother
of Mrs. A. Caminetti, who survives
him. He was interred in the Milton
cemetery by tho local lodge I. O. O. F.,
of which he was an honored member,
Mr. and Mrs. Caminetti and their son
Drew attended the burial services.

THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSOff, CALIFORNIA, FBIDAY, JULY 8, 1904.
A TRIP TO THE
WORLD'S FAIR
At the Fair.
Have been here a week and visived
the exposition every day. I shall not
attempt to give an account of the
sights in this letter, but Instead will
'confine myself to general topics. Many
erroneous ideas prevail as to the con
ditions here which ought to be ex
ploded. Before coming I heard much
about the heat of St. Louis, and the In
convenience therefrom in June and
July. Newspapers have publlcy pro
claimed St. Louis the hottest large city
on earth in July. That may be so, as
I am not prepared to say what July
may bring forth. Judging from the
last week of June, it may be set down
as a slander. Eighty-six is the highest
temperature recorded since we arrived.
Tbere is a peculiarty in the heat, ow
ing to the humidity in tho atmosphere;
at the same time a cool, refreshing
breeze is always present to temper the
sun's rays. Visitors from cold coun
tries might feel the heat, but certainly
those from Central California will suf
fer little therefrom.
Another thing may be mentioned
here: tbere is no lack of rooming ac
commodations. The fair has brought
an enormous influx of people; but the
accommodations have more than kept
pace with the demand. The city could
take care of twice the number of tran
sients than are now within its limits.
Naturally, rents have advanced, and
rooming charges have advauced like
wise. The spirit of gouging is not
missing, and unless the visitor is cau
tious he is apt to fall a victim. Charges
of $3 per day upwards for each person
for room alone is common, and often
the accommodations are of the poorest
character. I have reached the conclu
sion that those bouses sending out cir
culars to induce persons to secure
rooms in advance, and offering reduced
rates if so secured, are mostly frauds.
The "cheaper rate" is held out
simply to entrap the unwary. By look-
Ingaround the visitor soon finds that he
might have gotten better accommoda
tions for less money elsewhere. Stran
gers will do well to steer clear of these
tie-up concerns under whatever guise
they are operated. The better plan is
to secure a temporary place the first
night, and employ the first hours in
the city in looking around for suitable
quarters. It will not take long to do
this, unless the taste be of the extreme
fastidious order. We are domiciled in
the residence part of the city on Del
mar boulevard with a private family,
at $1 per day each, which la reasonable
under the circumstances.
On the fair grounds everything in
the eating and drinking line is high.
The grab-all spirit is there in all its
glory. There are exceptions, but tney
are few and far between. A drink of
water costs 5 cents; a meal cannot be
had for less than 75 cents or $1; straw
berries and cream 30 cents— fully
double the cost of edibles outside the
grounds. Why this extortionate sched
ule is tolerated is not clear. Certainly
it militates against the restaurants on
the fair grounds— and they are thick as
leaves in autumn. Many visitors de
cline to be held up in this way, and
pack their lunches with them. They
would not do so if reasonable prices
prevailed. As a rule people expect to
pay an extra price for things, but tney
draw the line on extortion. Two young
fellows from Pennsylvania came to
spend a week at the fair. At the expi
ration of two days they packed up and
left. When asked tho reason, they
said they would like to have stayed,
but they were "soaked" and "stuck,"
as they expressed it, all along the line,
and were thereby compelled to curtail
their visit. Maybe the concessionaires
have paid so much for tbo privilege of
doing business within the fair grounds
that they have to charge skyward
prices. If 60 the policy was a mistaken
one as far as applied to eating and
drinking necessaries. To us it seams
that the management might have reg
ulated these charges at least.
As to the exposition itself, it is grand
beyond all precedent. That which im
presses the visitor on taking a tour of
the world's fair is its immensity.
Everything is on a scale of greatness
never before attempted. The buildings
are of immense size, and scattered over
1240 acres. One has to do a heap of
walking to get even a feeble idea of this
wonderful exhibition. The next im
pression is the beauty of the buildings,
considering they are merely temporary
structures. The agricultural building
— the largest on the grounds— covers
21 acres. To walk through all its'
aisles, one would have to travel seven
miles. It Is needless to say that it is
impossible to get more than a hasty
view of even a small portion of the ex
hibits from a stay of two weeks. To
do the fair fully would require months.
It is beyond human endurance to see it
all, or even the major part of it. It is
a marvelous collection of the works of
nature and of man, dwarfing all pre
vious efforts in the same line. It shows
the development in all branches of
human activity, from the crude prod
ucts of primitive times to the amazing
achievements of tho present.
In conclusion, we may say we have
seen most of the buildings, the Philli
pine and Indian villages, and the prin
cipal sights on the Pike. The most
wonderful piece of machinery on the
ground, to my notion, Is connected
with the printing trade, and consists
of a type-casting and setting invention
called the Monotype. It may be seen
In actual operation, setting matter
from copy made by a type writer de
signed specially for Monotype work,
producing an exact duplicate In type of
the characters impressed upon the
type-written manuscript. It is the
nearest approach to infusing brains
Into a mechanical device that we hare
yet seen. R. W.

The Assessment for 1904.
The following figures show the as
sessed valuation of property in Amador
county for the year 1903-4:
In township No. 1 there is an appar
ent decrease of $60,316, while in all
the other townships there is a substan
tial gain. In township No. 3, there is
an apparent gain of $135,610. This is
accounted for mainly from the fact
that heretofore all the property belong
to the Standard Electric* Co. was as
sessed in township No. 1. The work is
now so nearly completed that the as
sessor has been able to seggregate the
property and give to township No. 3
what rightfully belongs to it. The
property in township No. 1 has in
creased in value just the same as in the
other townships, but the surrendering
to No. 3 its portion of the Standard
Electric property makes the apparent
decrease. This will add materially to
the road fund of No. 3 and will enable
Supervisor Grillo to do much more
work during the coming year. This is
the first time in the history of the
county that the assessment has reached
the $5,000,000 mark. There are 266,
809 acres of assessable lands in the
county.

A Sorry Speotacle.
Imagine such distinguished men as
D. M. Delmas, W. J. McGee and M. F.
Tarpey, dressed in knee pants, stand
ing In the corridor of one of the largest
hotels in St. Louis singing at the top
of their voices, the following silly little
conglomeration of words, thinking that
by a certain emphasis of a particular
word a candidate of meager ability
could be fostered upon the democratic
party as a fit personage to become
president of the United States.
THE SONQ.
Boom! Booml Boom!
First! First! First!
California, California,
Hearst! Hearst! Hearst!
At first it was considered a great bis
joke gotten up by some wag as a take
off on the prominent men who com
posed the State delegation, but the
next issue pf the Hearst papers repro
duced it in glaring type on the first
page and heralded It as the battle cry
that would down all others. So often
was it reprinted that people began to
think that "Willie" wrote it himself
and many heralded it as the greatest
of his recent productions. It proved
no joke but a reality. A part of the
California delegation actually assem
bled in one of the corridors of a large
hotel, braced themselves firmly and let
off a blast at the top of their voices.
No one shouted; another, and a death
ly silence prevailed ; a third, and the
dry bones of Willies latest effusion
lay prostrate upon the floor. In a
short time Delmas was looking for a
vacant lot in which to nominate Hearst.
McGee was interviewing a native Ha
waiian as to the probable eruption of
the Island volcanoes, and Tarpey was
looking for a Cuban representative to
ascertain if possible whether Roosevelt
was actually at the battle of San Juan
and how he thought Hearst would run
in the Island Republic.
Such methods of creating enthusiasm
are things of the past. Such frosts
should never be placed upon the shoul
ders of delegates. Let candidates do
as W. J. Bryan did in 1896, come be
fore the convention and by word and
action show to the convention that
they are worthy and capable and they
will receivesupport. Hearst is a dead
issue, acknowledged to be so by all
save himself, and we will say in justice
to our townsman, W. J. McGee, that we
will bet he was not in hearing distance
of that hotel at the time of the song
fiasco.
Quite Seriously Injured.
Judge M. J. Gordon, of Spokane, re
ceived 73 wounds in attempting to jump
a barbed wire fence in the dark near
Volcano Sunday evening. Dr. Frei
man found it necessary to stitch sov

he was being pursued by a rattler and
was not aware that the fence was near.

Eagle Eeady to Fly.
The golden eagle which has been
kept in a cage some two months at the
Irish Tavern, .corner of Seventh and
I streets, was to have been given flight
yesterday at 3 p. m. - A great crowd
assembled to see the bird of freedom
spread his wing? and soar in the vasty
blue.
But the expectant onlookers were
sadly disappointed. The eagle, when
released, spread his pinions, but was
unable to rise more than a few feet
from the ground and then fluttered
helplessly to earth i Three times it es
sayed flight and then gaspingly gave it
up and was restored to Its cage. Con
finement or injury at the time of its
capture incapacitated the eagle, but it
is believed that if given a run in the
open a few days it would be able to fly.

Gov. Geo. C. Pardee of California,
who has been spending some time at
the World's Fair, has become an ar
dent supporter of the great exposition.
Upon being Tasked as to what he
thought of the fair he said:
"I find the World's Fair In all ways
beyond my expectations. Its immen
sity at first appals one, but as the
homogeneity of the plan of arrange
ment unfolds itself, the visitor finds
that he can, in the space of a few days,
review the products, the manufactor
ies, and the peoples of the world. Pass
ing through the various buildings one
is struck with the greatness of our
country; and personal and official mod
esty does not forbid me saying that
California need not be ashamed of her
self. ' ' Even the Govenor of the Golden
State, who has spent all his life within
her borders, finds that he knew only a
little about his state until he went and
saw all her varied products assembled
together.

THE OPIUM CIGARETTE
[Original.]
"What's the meaning of this crowd?"
I asked of a railroad official at tie
Charing Cross station, London.
"The Russian, sir."
"What Russian?"
"Don't know, sir. He's some big
man In his country. These people are
to see him off, sir. He's going home."
I stepped into the compartment
Where I had engaged a seat. There I
found two elderly women with several
children, all of one party. Beyond, by
a window, sat a. young woman whose
appearance interested me at once.
Never have I seen such an expression
on any human face. The only descrip
tion I can give of It is that it reminded
me of a picture I had once seen of an
early Christian' martyr who had nerved
herself to be burled alive. But this
gives only a vague idea of the woman's
whole appearance. She was well
dressed, and her features and bearing
indicated one of the highest class.. It
was impossible for her to conceal a
mental restlessness that showed itself
especially in the eyes, which were
constantly moving.
The train made but one stop between
London and Folkestone, where the
party of women and children got out,
leaving only me and the woman I have
been trying to describe in the com
partment
"Thank heaven," she said to me In a
contralto voice, "they are gone! I am
sure you will not object to my smoking
a cigarette in this compartment,
though it Is not a smoker." •
"Certainly not, madam."
V'You speak French?" she asked in
that language.
' I assured her that I did, and after
that we conversed in the French lan
guage. I took out some cigarettes and
lighted one to keep her company, but
she Insisted on my smoking one of
hers, which, she said, had been made
expressly for her from a recipe fur
nished by a member of the suit of the
sultan of Turkey. I threw mine away
and took one of hers. I knew at once
that it contained opium, but how much
or what other drugs I did not know.
One thing I did know. I was rapidly
passing into a delightful trance, which
every whiff seemed to make still more
delightful. I saw the woman watching
me, and when she was satisfied that I
was powerless she opened a hand bag
beside her and took out. something
rolled in brown paper, opened it, took
out a wedge shaped piece of wood and,
seizing my chin, opened my mouth and
gagged me.
. This done, she took out a timetable,
which she scanned, looked at her
watch, cast a glance out of the win
dow, then momentarily gave way to a
terrible depression. I judged that she
was obliged to wait for something, and
on the eve of some move — one involv
ing life and death, 'for< instance— there
Is nothing like delay to break one
down. I noticed that we were passing
through a thickly settled district and
that as Boon as we had passed again
Into the country she nerved herself
and prepared for something she was
about to do.
Her first act was to disrobe. But in
stead of displaying the undergarments
of a woman she lay bare a man's out
er clothing. Her woman's attire was
merely a covering, which she threw
out of the window. Next she took a
glass globe about two inches in diam
eter from her satchel, and the satchel
followed the clothing. Then she— or
rather he, for by this time I had made
up my mind that the person was a
young man— cast a glance at me which
seemed to satisfy him, took another
look at his watch, peered out at the
passing landscape and after casting up
bis eyes and muttering a prayer
climbed out of the window and let him
self down on the footboard.
Had I not been under the influence of
opium I should have been profoundly
moved by all this. As it was it seem
ed but a part of my dream, and the
moment the singular being passed out
of it he was forgotten. I remember be
ing jarred by an explosion, but did not
at the time connect it with the young
man.
Whatever occurred was hushed up.
When we reached Folkestone a guard
was obliged to carry me on to the
channel boat, and I did not come to
myself again before we reached
Boulogne. I did not get an oppor
tunity to interview any of the passen
gers, and the whole affair was to me
something of a mystery. Indeed I fan
cied I had dreamed it under the influ
ence of an opium cigarette. If a bomb
was really exploded with a view to kill
ing the Russian official in another com
partment, It failed. My theory, based
on the view that it was a real occur
rence, was that the assailant dropped
the bomb before he was ready to ex
plode it in or under the compartment
occupied by the Russian.
Two years afterward I was in St.
Petersburg standing In a crowd watch-
Ing for the smperor to pass on his way
to review some of his troops. Among
the members of his staff I saw a face
that astonished me. I never forget
faces, and I certainly could never for
get this one. It was the face of the
young man who had drugged me on the
train between Boulogne and Folke
stone. Happening to glance down upon
me, he caught my astonished glance,
which doubtless helped him to recog
nize me. The cavalcade passed on, and
I returned to my hotel.
That night I was trying vainly to
sleep, for I was troubled about being
recognized as a nihilist and been rec
ognized by hip in the czar's suit, when
there was & knock on the door, and a
man entered.
"There is a midnight train for the
border," he said. "Get up and take
it"
In an hour I was on the train with
my visitor, who saw me Into another
country. GEORGE A. PARKER.

An Order
For Diamonds
[Copyright, 1904, by C. B. Lewis.]
The house of Sloane, Saunders & Co.,
London, had received a letter from Sir
James Blankton, living about a mile
out of the village of Morpeth, asking
them to send down a man with dia
monds for nlarriage presents. It was
Hided that his carriage woind meet
the man at the station at C o'clock in
Ibe evening. I was the one selected to
go, and I reached Morpeth on time
ivith £5,000 worth of diamonds con
cealed about my person. '
A carriage awaited me, but 1 had
uardly taken a seat in it when I had
queer feeliugs. The outfit was too
common to be owned and publicly
used by such a man as Sir James
Blankton, and the two men on the box
didn't appear at all like servants. I
made bold to say:
"See here, men. 1 think there is a
mistake. I think I have got Sir James
Blankton mixed up with Sir James
Dashton. It is the latter who owns
a large interest in a Manchester cot
ton factory, isn't it?"
"It may be, but I dunno," replied the
man who was driving as he pulled up
his horses.
"Well, you see, I wanted to show
him some of these new dyes for cot
tons."
"Is that your line, sir?"
"Yes. 1 liuve ten new colors just out
I am sorry for the blunder, but I am
willing"— ivfr'-c
"Then what the bloody blazes did
you get into this turnout for?"
'•To see Sir James Blankton, of
course. I got it in my head" —
"Oh, blow your 'cad and your 'eels
too! Jim, turn about and drive the
bloomln' ass back to town!"
"I'll be shot if I does!" replied Jim.
"He can get right out 'ere and take
'isself back on his own legs and be
blowed to him!"
When I had walked the two miles
and reached town, I went to a hotel.
Inside of five minutes I had learned
that Sir James Blankton lived in the
opposite direction to that I had taken.
Further, th::t the gentleman and his
wife had boon in Scotland for several
weeks. It did not take me long to
figure it out to my perfect satisfaction.
It was a put up job to rob the London
house through me, and it had been put
up with the aid of some one at Sir
James Blankton's house.
I started for London by the 9 o'clock
train. The night had come on dark and
stormy, and there were but few pas
sengers from Morpeth. There were
two plain women ticketed to Durham
and a man about forty years old of
pleasing address and genteel appear
ance. The four of us were ushered
Into the same compartment. As soon
as we fell into conversation the man
gave me to understand that he lived
at Beverly, a town about fifty miles
down the line, and from certain words
let fall I gathered that he was a prom
inent public official of the place. I
didn't exactly reply that I was In the
dye line, but he probably inferred as
much from what I said. I was glad of
his company. He was well posted, a
fair talker. - "„
The women got out at Durham and
left us alone. We passed Darlington
and . were still the sole occupants of
the compartment. Mr. Arnold, as he
had given his name, had been sitting
opposite me for an" hour. As the train
cleared Darlington, however, he rose
up and yawned and said:
"I am sleepy, and yet I can never
get a wink of sleep on the train. By
the way, I found a curious coin on the
street at Morpeth today. Can you make
anything of it?"
He had a coin in his fingers as be
stepped over to me. I reached out a
hand to receive It when he seized me
by the throat with both hands and had
me on my back ln a second. I was no
match for him in strength. He gripped
my throat so suddenly and so fiercely
that I was deprived of all powers of
resistance. Bending over me, with his
knee on my chest, he finally let up on
his clutch and said:
"Don't be foolish now! I know you
and am after those diamonds."
He drew a wicked looking knife and
held It in his teeth, while he used some
stout cord to tie my hands behind my
back. Why didn't I resist? Simply
because his clutch on my throat had
almost paralyzed me. When he had
taken the key of my Gladstone from
one of my pockets he turned me over
and said:
"Now for the sparklers. I know you
shifted them to* the bag when you were
at the hotel. A deuced fine layout, and
the cash value must be close to f 10,000.
It's a pretty haul indeed, and no risk
attending it."
He placed the jewel case in his pock
et, lighted a cigar and pleasantly con
tinued:
"Take it easy, my boy. The next
stop is North Allerton, and I shall gag
you and leave the train there. You'll
be discovered at Leeds or sooner."
I was so mad and my throat hurt me
bo much that I made no attempt to re
ply. After a couple of minutes the
train slackened speed, and in sixty sec
onds more it had come to a standstill.
"Special stop, is it?" growled the rob
ber as he took a gag from his pocket
and bent over me. "Well, here goes to
keep you quiet while I get away."
'Just then the guard opened the door
to admit two passengers, and I began
to yell at the top of my voice. The
robber made a bolt for it, and he would
have got off temporarily at least but
for an accident. He caught his foot
and fell heavily on the platform, and
before he could rise the guards had
him secure. The job had been put up
between him and the two men who
d/ove me, assisted by a maid in Sir
James Blankton's house, and I had the
satisfaction of seeing the quartet sent
to prison for long terms. M. QUAD.

A WILY LAWYER.
The War He Made Hl* Opponent Win
a Cone For Him.
Lord Brampton, a famous English
cross examiner, told a story of how he
once won a case on a technical ground
when he had no defense. He forced a
magistrate's clerk to be put into the
witness box by; the prosecution to
prove a purely formal matter. Now,
having got him there, he cross exam
ined him and made him practically
admit that he "led his magistrates by
the nose;" to admit also that they had
refused ball by his advice and that a
judge at chambers had afterward
granted it, although the witness had
come up all the way from London to
oppose It. Then, asked the cross ex
aminer, "You were in the room, sir,
and did you not hear the learned judge
say there was not a rag of a case
against my unhappy client?" The
prosecuting counsel objected, and It
was ruled out. But the Jurors had
heard it and had heard the answer
stopped. The dissatisfaction thus ad
duced ln their minds made them acquit
the prisoner. Leaving the court that
day, the prisoner's counsel asked his
opponent, "Why did you object to that
question 7' The latter indignantly
protested that his adversary . when he
asked It must have known that It
could not be put. "Yes, I did," was the
answer; "but I knew you, too, and
felt sure that you would object at. the
right time. But you should have wait
ed for the answer, as It would -have
been 'No!' "
An Oriental Sherlock Holmes.
A book on India tells of a native de
tective ■whose methods were anything
but scrupulous. One Important matter
Investigated was a robbery of about
half a lakh of rupees' worth of silver
Ingots (about $25,000) that was sent
down on camels with an escort of fif
teen armed men from Indore to Kotah.
The escort was killed by Dacoits and
the silver taken. Isrl Pershad, the ori
ental Sherlock Holmes, rasseldar major
of a native regiment, made it his busi
ness to bring these men to justice and
when asked ln after years how he ob
tained his proofs remarked, smilingly
stroking his beard, that if a man was
judiciously strung up, spread eagle
wise, by his thumbs, much useful In
formation might be extracted, and,
having no marks of 111 treatment to
show to the sahibs, he generally held
his tongue. Of a certain witness in
this case he wrote that he had "given
'awfully good evidence' at the trial, but
as there was 'Just a little discrepancy'
between this and his previous deposi
tions before the political agent, when
the original files were called for by the
higher court, 'It would be better to
omit this one and say It had been eaten
by white ants. 1 "

for Health
' 222 South Peoria St.,
Chicago, 111., Oct. 7, 1902.
Eight months ago I was bo ill
that I was compelled to lie or sit '
down nearly all the time. My
stomach was so weak and upset
that I could keep nothingr on it
and I vomited frequently. I
could not urinate without great
pain and I coughed so much that
my throat ana lungs were raw
and sore. The doctors pro-
nounced it Bright 'a disease and
others said it was consumption.
It mattered little to me what
they called it and I had no de-
sire to live. A sister visited me
from St. Louis and aaked me if
I had ever tried Wine of Cardui:
I told her I had not and she
bought a bottle. I believe that
it saved my life. I believe many
women could save much suffer-
■ ing if they but knew of its value.
Don't you want freedom from
■ pain? Take Wine of Cardui
and make one supreme effort to
! be well. You do not need to be
a weak, helpless sufferer. You
I can have a woman's health and
do a woman's work in life. Why
not secure a bottle of Wine of
Cardui from your druggist to-
day?

THE MAN WITH
THE BROWN BEARD
tOrUflaaJ.!
At the first station after crossing the
Itussian border a man got into the
compartment, took a seat directly op
posite me, pulled out a newspaper and
began to read. I. was reading too.
Presently, probably actuated by
thought transference, probably by co
incidence, we raised our eyes to each
other at the same moment The man
turned quickly and looked out of the
window. I resumed my reading. .When
I looked up again his eyes were fixed
upon me. .'''J-
I carefully noted the man's appear
ance, lie wore a brown beard, while
his hair was black and sprinkled with
gray. He was tall and slender, with
a slight stoop. He looked more re
spectable than his clothes, which were
very shabby.
That evening while at supper at my
inn I suddenly felt an Inclination to
look up. My eyes met those of the
man with the brown beard. This time
there was a slight scowl on his face,
but he lowered his eyes to his plate
and went on with his supper.
In the morning I proceeded on my
journey, stopping again the next even
ing. While sitting In the office smok
ing who should come in but this man,
who I was now fully convinced was
shadowing me. As he passed me he
started, but whether his surprise was
real or feigned I could not make out
He put down his belongings, except a
morocco covered box. A servant who
gathered up the traps • attempted to
take the box as well, but the man held
on to It nervously.
I am something of a detective, and
the Incident, though trifling, interested
me. Was not the box an Infernal ma
chine, and did not the man take me for
a high Russian official traveling incog?
The next day I took a train for St
Petersburg, not needing to stop over
night, for the distance was but a hun
dred miles. On entering my compart
ment I noticed that there was but a
single person In it besides myself. Tak
ing my seat, I let down p window for
better air, arranged my belongings,
then, while taking a book from my
satchel, glanced at my fellow passen
ger.
He was the man' with the brown
beard. .'•-' : '
A moment later, though I was not
looking directly at him, I saw him tug
ging at something under his overcoat
as though he were getting a revolver
into a position where he could use it
expedltlously. My conscience was so
clear of any intention that would call
his weapon into service that' l simply
gave him a contemptuous glance, then,
* opening my book, began to read. After
awhile I dropped It on my lap and
sank into a light slumber. But before
losing consciousness I saw my shadow
er nervously reaching under his seat
to feel for his box and casting suspi
cious glances at me.
I was awakened by something strik
ing heavily against me. Opening my
eyes, I saw the man with the brown
beard . trying to regain his balance,
having evidently been thrown upon me
by a lurch of the coach. But what
was my surprise and, I will admit con
