ROPES AS FIRE ESCAPES.
An Experience Which Shook One
Mnii'n Confidence In Them.
"Yes, I know that most of the boys
carry a rope around with 'em," said
the commercial traveler, "and the time
was when I would not have taken the
road without one, but I gave mine to
my wife for an extra clothesline three
or four years ago. I read occasionally
of a rope saving somebody from a
turning hotel, but I don't care to be
saved that way."
"But you don't want to be burned
with the hotel, do you?" was asked.
"Of course not, but if I can't get
down by the stairs or the iron fire
escape I'll take my chances on a mat
tress or a firemen's ladder."
"But what's the matter with a knot
ted rope?". : >v:
, "I didn't think anything was the
matter for many years. I used to go
to bed feeling as safe as-'a baby in
his crib, and if I found a traveler who
didn't carry a fifty foot rope in his grip
I set him down as a very reckless man.
One day when I was in an Indiana
town a lot of us got to talking about
ropes and burning hotels, and a wall
eyed bluffer offered to bet me $5 to $1
that I couldn't slide down my ' rope
from a third story window and not
half kill myself. Of course I jumped
at the bet, but he knew what he was
talking about. I hadn't lowered my
self six feet before the rope burned
my hands and I let go and broke a leg.
The . trick was tried by three \ others
and though they escaped broken bones
they were badly shaken up and tongue
bitten. After my leg mended I bluffed
everybody I met on that rope business,
and I never found a chap who could
slide down two stories and feel good
for a month after. A sailor could do
it, of course', but I'm no sailor,- and if
ever I'm cut off by fire I'll take a head
er for the sidewalk and hope to hit a
fat man as I come down."— Exchange.
PAPERING. THE PINS.
An Insenions Operation That Is Per-
formed by Machinery.
The first plus made in this country
were very crude indeed, merel}' a bit
of wire twisted into a knot for a head
at one end and sharpened to a point at
the other. Their successors of today
undergo a surprising variety of opera
tions before they are considered fit for
use. ■""
In comparison with the size of the
object manufactured the operations
seem bewilderlngly numerous, but If
there be one process more remarkable
than another it is "papering the pins."
The papers, having been passed
through an ingenious machine which,
at regular Intervals, according to the
size of the pin, pinches up a fold and
pricks a hole In it, are ready to receive
the pins.
For this purpose there is another ma
chine, worked by two children. One
feeds the pins, the other the papers.
The first part of the machine is a box
about twelve inches long, six broad and
four deep. The bottom is composed of
small square steel bars, sufficiently far
apart to let the shank of the pin fall
through, but not the head. These bars
are Just as thick as. the space between
papered pins. The lower part of the
bottom of the box Is made to detach it
self as soon as the row of pins is com
plete." Row after row, at regular in
tervals, Is received and passed down a
corresponding set of grooves until it
reaches the ready pricked paper. By
the nicest possible adjustment these
pins come exactly to their places and
are pressed into them. By this method
two little girls can in one day put up
many thousands of papers.— Kansas

WISE MEN'S MISTAKES.
Some of tht; Queer Blunders Made
by Fnmnua Writers.
Now and then one meets with pas
sages in the works of the most cele
brated authors which display an ig
norance of. things that every schoolboy
is supposed to know.
Sir Walter Scott in his "Heart of
Midlothian" speaks of j his heroine as
having "the merit of those peacemak
rrs to whom It is pronounced as a
benediction that 1! •?>■ s'lall infterit tiit
earth." Born and bred and passing
his life In Bible reading Scotland, Sir
Walter wns yet ignorant of the fact
that it was to the meek that the. in
heritance of the earth was promised,
and the benediction of the peacemakers
.was that "they shall ba called the chil
dren of God."
Dickens in his "Tale of Two Cities"
says "the name of ths strong man of
old Scripture descended to the chief
functionary who worked the guillo
tine." One does not have to.be a pro
found student of the French revolution
to knoiv that the notorious executioner
who chopped off heads in the Place ile
la Revolution was named Sanson and
not Samson. ''/. ;;■
The lowest pupil in the lowest class
in history in the public schools knows
that it was Balboa who discovered the
Pacific ocean, yet Keats in his im
mortal sonnet "On First Looking Into
Chapman's Homer" makes Cortes the
man who stood "silent upon a peak in
Darien" nnd saw the great "south sea"
stretching away before him.
The great Gibbon, who was so intol
erant of the errors of other men,
speaks in his "Roman Empire" of "the
Oxus and the Jaxartes, two rivers of
ancient renown which descend from
the mountains of India toward the
Caspian sea." Yet every school geog
raphy shows that the two rivers flow
into the sea of Aral, and the Jaxartes
most certainly rises In no "mountains
of India." '-■ ■
Shakespeare wrote of "the coast of
Bohemia," and in his "Gertrude of
Wyoming" Campbell had tigers prowl
ing through the jungles of Pennsylva
nia! Such "ignorance in high places"
cannot be excused, for, with ordinary
ease, Gibbon, Shakespeare and Camp
bell could have ascertained the facts.

JOCKEYS IN TRAINING
KEEPING THE WEIGHT DOWN IS NOT
A DIFFICULT PROBLEM.
Fattening; Foods Are Avoided, and
Judicious Exercise Is~ Courted— As
a Rule, Riders Last a Doien Years
and as a Class Are Not Saving.
is a popular belief," a well known
trainer said to a reporter recently,
"that a jockey has to resort to all sorts
Of injurious practices in order, to keep
Us weight within required limits. The
idea, however, is a far stretched one.
Of- course a jockey has to go through
certain exercises each day and has to
be very much more careful regarding
what he puts in his stomach than moat
people in order to keep his weight down
a&Vfrpm' acquiring a superfluity of
ttesh, but he certainly does not starve
himself, as is generally supposed. If
be did so he would break down entirely
In a very short time. A jockey. must
also be in the best possible physical
trim and have his wits about him be
fore a race, and to attain that he must
be careful how he uses his constitution.
"There are two very important things
a jockey has to consider in studying his
dietary. He must see to it that his food
is of the best quality and that it con
tains practically no flesh forming prop
erties. All such fattening foods as, for
Instance, soups, beef, pork,' potatoes,
puddings and pastries a jockey must
deny . himself. Coffee, - tea or other
drinks are only taken very moderately,
as all liquids help more or 'less in put
ting on flesh.
"Although a jockey has to eschew
such foods, there are many other varie
ties which' he gets just as much pleas
ure in eating and which at the same
time are equally as good and strength
ening for his constitution. A few days
before a race a jockey who has a
mount in it will not stint himself—pro
vided he has no fear of overlapping
his proper weight for the race— ln any
thing which he thinks will not inter
fere with his digestive apparatus.
"Some jockeys, of course, take on
and lose flesh quicker than others. I
have known one or two who were par
ticularly anxious to ride In certain
races, but for which they were perhaps
as much as eight or nine pounds too
heavy, who reduced that weight in the
same number of days. To accomplish
that, however, they have to resort prac
tically to a 'starving diet,' leaving as
little as the strain on the vitality will
permit without breaking down and try-
Ing to reduce their overweight by cer
tain sweating exercises. It is needless
to say that no jockey could stand too
frequent repetitions of such severe
measures to subtract from his weight
without danger of permanently injur
ing his health and even sacrificing his
life; still, many willingly resort to such
'get light weight quick' methods where
they see good opportunities of making
a name or a pile of money for them
selves.
"It must be remembered that by na
ture Jockeys as a whole are not of sub
stantial physique or imposing in height,
although they are as tough as whlp
cosd. If they were, therefore, to in
dulge every day in the heavy bill of
fare that the average business or work
ing man partakes of It Is not probable
that they would Increase much in
weight or height. You often see jock
eys in the big hotels and restaurants
at the various racing sections after a
race tucking in big and expensive din
ners with a gusto and relish that
would give a chronic dyspeptic an ap
petite for hard tack.
"Walking, running, cycling, punching
the bag and hurdle jumping are favor
ite exercises among jockeys to keep
their weight down. On going out for
a walk or run they wrap themselves in
the thickest of woolen sweaters and
other heavy clothing, no matter how
high the temperature may be, and the
exercise Is kept up for a distance per
haps of eight or nine miles, or, as we
say, until you are 'drowned in sweat'
Turkish baths are also frequently in
dulged In by many, and they must
wear excessively warm clothing after,
and also when going for a gallop, no
matter if the weather be boiling hot
"I should say that ten or twelve
years Is the average of a jockey's ac
tive turf life. The length of his career,
however, depends a great deal on his
riding ability and luck.
"Jockeys are not of a saving class,
and with but few exceptions I know
of none who has ever managed to put
enough money away to keep him in
even half decent comfort after retiring
from the turf. The majority, however,
succeed in scraping up a bank roll of
sufficient dimensions to start In some
business. Like .retired pugilists,' they
have a fondness J for the liquor . busi
ness, and I know a few one time Jock
eys who are prospering in that trade in
different parts of the country. Others,
again, become 'bookies,' poolroom keep
ers and enter into such' businesses as
enable them to gratify their Inveterate
love for gambling. • I know "of only one
ex-Jockey who Is an exception to this
rule. He retired some years ago with
$60,000 to his credit, and he immedi
ately went into the real estate business
in New Jersey. Today he is doing well.
He was fortunate enough, however, to
receive a good common school educa
tion in his early boyhood days— and
that's a thing jockeys very rarely get
Outside of their knowledge of horse
manship the great majority are as
ignorant as red Indians."— New York

CARE FOR SLEEPERS
A CLUB WHERE DOZING MEMBERS
ARE NEVER DISTURBED.
There Is a Good Reason For This
Custom, Which Is' Not Allowed to
Be Violated— A Short Sleep Which
' Culminated In a Tragedy.
There is an exclusive club in upper
New York where the employees are for
bidden from awakening any member
who drops asleep in his chair in the li
brary or sitting room. If a' visitor in
quires for him he Is "out" Other mem
bers, if they see him, carry on their
conversation In low tones or go' to the
smoking room or cafe. ...Very few new
members are admitted to the club, but
those who are fortunate enough to get
in or those who bring visitors are re
minded of this custom.
A physician who belongs to the club
explained the reason of it. "It is
wrong . under any circumstances," he
said, "to awaken a man who has fallen
into a natural sleep. How do you
know but it Is the first time he has
been able to sleep for hours or even
days? This phenomenon of sleep is a
very complicated one. There are many
grades of sleep, and they affect differ
ent men in different ways. Dreams
are the result of defective or partial
sleep, and their y common occurrence
in the lighter varieties of the state
shows that the rest taken by most per
sons is not profound or continuous
even while it lasts. '
"Don't you know that scores of per
sons in New York take a long trolley
ride in the evening simply to produce
a feeling of sleepiness? If a man lookß
straight ahead of him or reads a news
paper his ride will do him little good.
He might as well remain at home on
his front stoop. But If he looks about
him, constantly shifting his gaze from
one scene to another, be gets into a
state of drowsiness such as is brought
about by artificial means when It Is
called hypnotism. That is why bo
many men feel like dozing in the club
after they come In from a ride or a
drive in the park.
"Sleep Induced by overeating is not
natural. That brought about by stimu
lants is nothing but blood poisoning
and stupor. It may be desirable and
even necessary in some cases to pro
duce this stupor. But the state Into
which the brain is thrown is not sleep.
If natural sleep follows, it Is a con
tingency and not the effect of the
stimulant. But I was going to tell
you a story, not deliver a medical lec
ture. I must not mention names, but
many old club men of New York will
remember the tragedy.
"There was a man who was quite
prominent, both in a business and so
cial way, In the life of this city. A
dreadful family misfortune brought on
Insomnia. He would sometimes go
forty-elght hours without sleep; then
after a normal night or two he would
not be able to sleep for a week. All
his life until his trouble 'came upon
him he bad been habitually a heavy
sleeper. After two or three months of
this insomnia attack his health began
to give way. Physicians tried all the
usual means of overcoming the diffi
culty, but failed. He was prescribed
sleeping drafts until 'it became dan
gerous to continue them longer. : .
"Then he went to Europe, taking a
competent young physician of my ac
quaintance as companion. Specialists
abroad prescribed walking and moun
tain climbing, but they discovered that
there is nothing to be gained by in
creasing the fatigue of the body when
worry of mind will not allow the re
pose to which the limbs are entitled.
The man came home little the better
for his trip. He retired from business.
His strength wasted away.
"Finally by one of those curious
freaks of nature we occasionally
caught him dozing at the club. All
who knew his misfortune sympathised
with him. We moved about as though
in a sick chamber until he awoke. He
seldom slept more than twenty min
utes and told us that bis restlessness
at night continued. One afternoon he
came in positively drowsy: To a friend
he said:
" 'I feel as though I could sleep for a
week, but I can't sleep in my own
home— no. Find me a bed here.'
"We got him upstairs to a room and
put a man on guard at the door, with
Instructions to see that no servant was
allowed to disturb him or make a noise.
An hour or so afterward an accident
in the kitchen brought the fire engines
up to the door. There was really no
danger, but before a ladder could be
raised poor Blank's body came tum
bling into the area.
"He was killed. Suicide? No. It
was the opinion of all of us that sud
den awakening from the first sound
sleep he bad enjoyed for more than a
year upset his mind and that when he
was awakened by the noise he did not
realize where he was. In a frenzy he
leaped from the window."— New York

and offering their services to amuse
the lady of the house. This offer ac

is based on the belief that words of
Anglo-Saxon origin are more simple

Latin. In point of fact some Anglo-
Saxon words are obscure and long, and
many of our commonest most simple
words are from the Latin. The Lon

The Vision of Birds.
Birds have very acute vision, per
haps the most acute of any creature,
and the sense is also more widely dif
fused over the retina than is the case
with man. Consequently a bird can
see sideways as well as objects in front
of it. A bird sees, showing great un
easiness in consequence, a hawk long
before it is visible to man. So, too,
fowls and pigeons find minute scraps
of food, distinguishing ' them • from
what appear to us exactly- similar
pieces of earth or gravel. - . v;
Young chickens are also able to find
their own food, knowing its position
and how distant it Is, as soon as they
are hatched, whereas a child only very
gradually learns either ! to see or to
understand . the : distance . of ' objects.
Several birds, apparently the young of
all those that nest on the ground, can
see quite well directly they come out
of the shell, but the young of birds that
nest in trees or on rocks are born blind
and have to be fed.— Chambers' Jour

FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 25, 1903
STILL CARPING.
Our cotemporaries continue to be
. flooded with a lot of stuff anert the
appeal of the justice's salary case to
the supreme court. The shades of
Ceasar and Alexander have been
appealed to in tbe frenzied effort to
stay further proceedings We pre
sume before the sluices are finally
exhausted, the rest of the worthies
■of ancient history will be called upon
"to interpose in this high behalf. II
the same tactics which have been
resorted to in this salary matter bad
been tried in any other litigation,
they would have called down upon
: the would-be obstructionists the con
demnation of an outraged public.
The amazing part of it is, the jus
tices and constables are held up by
our cotemporaries and editors pro
tern as martyrs. The supervisors
will not pay them their fee bills, and
the auditor will not pay them sal
- aries, until he is satisfied by tbe de
cision of the highest judicial tribunal
- that be is justified in so doing.
" Even if this were true — which it is
not, as the offer bas been made to
allow them their fees on account,
and the offer refused — they have
themselves to blame for the plight
in which they are placed. Were they
not in high glee when tbe salary bill
was before the legislature? Were
they not hand in glove working for
its passage? It was common talk at
that time that its constitutionality
was a matter of serious doubt if tbe
present incumbents were made the
.. beneficiaries of the measures. But
notwithstanding this, they were
more than anxious to line up under
its questionable provisions. Were'
there not at tbe time it was before
tbe lawmakers, petitions circulated
with the view of booming it into
popularity, even in spite of its ap
parently contraband character.
Were not articles published at that
time by its supporters urging that
the law be left in the hands of tbe
supervisors, and not be taken to
the courts for interpretation? Tbe
methods that have been following
since the mandamus proceedings
were started have been op a par with
- these initiatory steps. Everything
had been done to create an im
pression that it is an act bordering
on treason to think of taking tbe
case to the supreme court. To such
an extreme has the appeal been
fought, that a wide-spread suspicion
is creeping over the public mind of
wheels working within wheels in this
program of hindrance. Blunder has
succeeded blunder; folly piled on
folly to close up the pathway of ap
peal. But all in vain. The Alex
ander has not grown so great as to
be able to dictate absolutely tbe
policy of Amador county in such
matters. The weakness and vas
cillating course of the no-appeal side,
is in striking contrast with the firm
and resolute stand of those whose
business it is to do what they can to
protect the public interests. In the
face of a great deal that calls for
censure; in the preseuce of abuse
alike uncalled for and unmerited,
the one redeeming feature of this
comedy of errors is the fact that the
district attorney and county auditor
remain immovable as rock in place,
determined to carry the controversy
to the tribunal which has been insti
tuted specially for the ' final settle
ment of such questions.
COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTEND
ANCE.
Parents may not be aware that by
a law passed by the last legislature
the attendance of children between
the ages of 8 and 14 upon the public
school is made compulsory. Every
child is required to attend for at
least five months durinjf the year,
and at least eighteen weeks of the
attendance must be consecutive.
Any parent or guardian failing to
comply with this law is guilty of a
misdemeanor. For the first offense
the penalty is not to exceed $10 fine
or imprisonment not exceeding five
days. A subsequent offense is pun
ishable by a fine not less than $10
nor more than $50, or imprisonment
not less than five nor more than 25
days, or both. It is the province of
constables in their respective town
ships to see that this law is complied
with. The percentage of children
failing to take advantage of the
liberal education provided by the
state is large. Our free school sys
tem — tbe most liberal and thorough
vouchsafed by any government — is
not appreciated as it should be. It
is to correct the growing evil of
non-attendance that this stringent
law was passed.

THE ISSUE EXPLAINED.
As interested parties are doiug
their utmost to create a false im
pression regarding the issue involved
in tbe township officers salary bill,
which is moving up to tbe supreme
court from this county, it is not out
of place to state the case plainly at
this time. The idea is given out
that justices and constables are be
ing unjustly denied any compensa
tion either under the old fee law or
tbe new salary bill, by the arbitrary
action of the auditor. That they are
compelled, on account of his stand,
to either work for nothing, pending
the decision of the matter on appeal,
or resign their offices. This is not
the case, and never has been tbe
case. Tt is nothing more than an
effort to awaken sympathy, and de j
ceive the public as regards tbe real
issue. No one denies that the jus
tices and constables are entitled to
compensation; if not under the sal
ary law, they are still entitled to
pay under the fee system. This ;is
conceded. There is no dispute, on
this proposition, and any attempt to
sow a different impression is prompt
ed by ulterior motives. A bill was
passed by the 'a«t legislature chang
ing the pay of township officers from
fees to a stated salary. Bills of a
similar character bad been passed
for other counties it is true: but as
far as we have been able to ascertain
the constitutional provision pro
hibiting an increase ot compensa
tion of "any official during his term
of office," was respected in all of
them, and tbe act was made to take
effect at the commencement of the
next term. But the bill boosting
the compensation of township offi
cers in Amador county took a dif-
Terent course. It was by the terms
of the bill itself made to take effect
immediately. All tbe then existing
township officers, elected under an
entirely different schedule of com
peusation, were at once clamoring
to be taken in under its liberal folds.
The bill itself was deliberately and
wilfully designed to 6et aside the
constitutional restriction bearing on
this question. Had the advocates
of the bill been content with making
it applicable to the next official term,
no question would have been raised
as to its validity. Tbe wisdom of
the law even then may have been
doubted, but the constitutional ob
jection would not have been raised.
We venture to say that neither the
county auditor nor the district at
torney _ has the slightest personal
feeling in the matter. They are both
as anxious for the justices and con
stables to get what they are legally
entitled to as those officers are them
selves. The offer has been made
that their bills under the fee system
be allowed by the supervisors as
heretofore, and paid by the treas
urer, pending the outcome of the ap
peal of this case. If the auditor wins
on appeal, they would then have re
ceived all they were entitled to; if
the township officers win out, they
would then be entitled to additional
pay sufficient to make up tbeamount
of salary due under the salary bill.
Why this arrangement has not been
made we are unable to explain. The
fault for its miscarriage does not
rest with the appellant side of this
controversy. Realizing, however,
that the salary bill, with the "take
effect immediately" clause tacked
thereto, strikes down one of the
vitally important provisions of the
state constitution, the auditor and
district attorney deem it their duty
under the solemnity of their official
oaths, and for the protection of tbe
county and their bondsmen, and in
fact of all parties concerned, to have
the controversy solved by the higher
court. That is all there is to it. In
stead of wailing at the coun ty of
ficers for taking this course, the jus
tices and constables, and their
friends, ought to hail with satisfac
tion tbe prospect of a definite and
complete settlement of the points
involved.
The Dinner Roar.
It is a curious fact that with almost
every generation the dinner hour has
undergone a change, the principal meal
of the day being eaten at different pe
riods, from 10 o'clock in the morning
until 10 o'clock at night. The author
of "The Pleasures of the Table" points
out that In England 400 or 500 years
ago people took four meals—breakfast
at 7, dinner at 10, supper at 4 and liv
ery at 8. In France in the thirteenth
century 9 In tbe morning was the din
ner hour; Henry VII. dined at 11. In
Cromwell's time 1 o'clock had come to
be the fashionable hour and in Addl
son's day 2 o'clock, which gradually
was transformed into 4. Pope found
fault with Lady Suffolk for dining so
late as 4. Four and 5 continued to be the
popular dining hours among tbe aris
tocracy until the Becond decade of the
nineteenth century, when dinner was
further postponed, from which period
It bas steadily continued to encroach
upon the evening.

TIIE OIA-DOB LEDGER: JACKSON, CALirORyiA, FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 25, 1903.
THE TAX LEVY.
The board of supervisors has fixed
the tax levy for the current year at
$2 on the $100. While this is five
cents in excess of the rate last year,
it is not so hitfb. as was expected
several weeks ayo. The increase is
attributable entirely to the jump of
18 cents in the state tax. Two
things have contributed to keep
down the levy, namely, first the
enormous increase of taxable prop
erty throughout the state, and the
furtfrer inflation of values in many
counties by the arbitrary action of
the state board of equalizers; sec
ond, the increase of tbe county's
assessment roll as returned by the
county assessor. In 1902 the assess
ment roll of Amador county was
$4,618,830; in 1903 the figures are
$4,916,533, or an increase of nearly
$300,000. Last year the total rev
enue from property taxes, assuming
that all dues were collected, was in
round numbers $90,000, while this
year the amount is $98,000. The in
crease of $8000, however, is entirely
due to the raise of 18 cents in the
state rate as compared with last year.
All the local funds show a slight
decrease of probable revenue when
compared with the levy of 1902, ex
cept the hospital and school fuuds,
both of which demand and are al
lowed enhanced revenue. To show
the changes in the tax levy for the
various purposes,"we herewith give
for the sake of comparison, the rates
levied in 1902 and 1903, as follows:
1902 " 1903
State 38.2 56.1
Current expense 60 51.9
Hospital 15 17
School 32 32
General road 35.8 33
Special road 14 io
Total $1.95 $2.00
To enable our readers to have a
clear idea of the sum required for
tbe different funds, we submit the
following table showing the revenue
by, the tax levy for the several funds
for 1902 and 1903:
1902 1903
State fund 18, 483 27, 581
Current expense 27,712 25,117
Hospital 6,928 8,357
Schools 14,779 15,732
Roads 16,534 16,223
Special road .. 6,466 4,916
In the estimated needs for the en
suing year, upon which the rates
were fixed by the supervisors, the
proposed change in the mode of com
pensating township officers, from
fees to salaries, does not figure ■ It
was calculated that the increased
expense, in the event of the salary
idea prevailing, would not affect the
forthcoming year, as the case in the
supreme court will hardly be decided
until far into next year. This must
be born in mind. If that expense
was a certainty to be reckoned with,
it would have made a difference of
10 cents additional in the levy.

Board of Supervisors.
The board of supervisors met Mon
day last for the purpose of making the
tax levy for the current year. AH the
members were present.
The railway mileage within the
limits of Amador county was establish
ed at eight miles.
A communication from the state
board of equalization was read, stating
that tho assessment of railroad property
was -fixed at $120,000, or at the rate of
$15,000 per mile.
A communication from George A.
Gordon, superintendent of schools, was
road, stating that the sum of $15,000
would be required for tho county school
fund for the ensuing year.
The trustees of the lono high school
reported that they estimated the cost
of maintaining the high school at
$2400, as follows: Salary of teachers,
$1750; rent of building, $200; janitor,
$50; furniture and incidentals, $400.
The financial report of the auditor
was received and approved, showing
the total assessment roll to be 34,916,533.
The board thereupon established the
tax levy on the various funds for the
year 1903 as follows:
State fund 56.1
Current expense fund..... 51.9
Hospital 17

to correspond with the court room.
Geo. Troin. who was struck on the

the outcome of the injuries received
that day. His jaw was swollen to such
an extent for several days after the oc

could not be made until the swelling
had somewhat subsided. Dr. Gall was
ovor in Amador City last Sunday, and
was called in consultation. The lower
jaw was found to be fractured; two or
three teeth were removed. Altogether
he was severely shaken up, but is get

Garbarini was through Calaveras coun
ty week . before last examining the
bridges, and found several of them to
be badly in need of repairs, and so re
ported to the board.
W. T. Robinspn, the veteran mining
man of Mokelumne Hill, was in Jack
son Saturday. He is at present operat
ing the Stockton hill gravel claim near
Mokelumne Hill. This was very rich
in early days, but has not been worked
for years. Several companies have
tried to work it since, but did not suc
cood in making it pay. The Colonel is
sanguine of the outcome of the present
operations. He says if the yield aver
ages one dollar per tpn there is big
money in it, as the auriferous gravel
and cement deposit is of vast extent.
The Colonel is an indefatigable worker,
and it is the sincere hope of his many
friends that he will "strike it rich."

THE DRYTOWN HOMICIDE.
Preliminary Examination of M. Ferrari
for the Killing of Antonio Sampio.
The preliminary examination of M.
Ferrari for the killing of Antonio
Sampio was held before Justice H.
Goldner in Jackson on Wednesday, in
the sheriff's office. District Attorney
C. P. Vicini conducted the case for the
prosecution, and A. Caminetti appear
ed for the defendant. The only eye
witness of the fracas which led to the
death of Sampio was A. Gazzero. The
encounter took place at the boarding
house of M. CavaleroinDrytbwn, about
midnight. After the evening meal, the
witness stated, half a dozen men
were gathered round a table on the
back porch of the boarding house, en
gaged in playing a game of cards,
called three sevens. Four played at a
time. Tho two principals in the quarrel
that ensued, were in the game from
start to finish. As the night wore on,
some of the players retired, leaving
Ferrari and Sampio in the game, with
Gazzero as the only onlooker, who
waited upon them, bringing them a
bottle of wine: Other bottles stood
upon the table. The night was dark,
but a solitary candle furnished illumi
nation. Sampio was a taller and larger
man than Ferrari. The witness stated
that toward midnight Sampio became
angry, and made a remark, striking
the table with his fist in an excited
manner. Ferrari said he had a sore
foot and did not want to quarrel.
Sampio raised from his seat and called
the other man ad — fool. Ferrari then
put in a remark which seemingly raised
the ire of the deceased to the breaking
point, saying, that "his shirt was
cleaner than his." At this Sampio
jumped up, and passed quickly to the
side of the table where Ferrari was,
and attempted to strike him with his
fist. Ferrari threw himself back and
dodged the blow, and took up a bottle
from the table and struck Sampio with
tbe thick part of it over the left eye.
Gazzero took Sampio home after re
ceiving the blow. He was able to walk,
although he assisted him home to some
extent. On his return to the Cavalero
boarding house, Sampio also reappear
ed there a few minutes afterward. The
victim did not go to work the day fol
lowing the midnight row. Hesawhim
that day with his head bandaged. He
went to his work at the Fremont the
second day after the affair. Witness
could not tell tbe date of his death or
when the doctor was called.
The examination was continued until
next week, owing to the defendant's
attorney having to leave for the city
for a few days.
Blue Bock Shooting.
Last Sunday on Dwyer'6 hill there
was blue rock shooting during the
afternoon for prizes. At tho miners'
picnic on labor day there were two bar
rels of blue rocks left over, so the shoot

son Miners' Union to dispose of them.
Two prizes were offered. First prize,
a carving set of three pieces; second
prize, a silver hunting cup. No en
trance fee was charged. The affair at
tracted a large number of sports, and
the shooting was kept up from two
o'clock until noarlysix. Herbert Meeks
captured the first prize, with a score of
21 out of 25 birds. For the second
prize there Were three ties, C. Valvo,
A. Grainger and M. Nixon, each making

FATAL ACCIDENT
AT ZEILA MINE
Joseph Gregor Falls 700 Feet in the
Zeila Shaft. — Gloom Cast Over the
Whole Community at Tragic End.
An accident which sent a thrill of
horror through the community hap
pened at the Zeila mine on Thursday
evening, causing the instantaneous
death of one of the oldest and most
efficient employes. About 5 o'clock the
skip was ascending tho shaft, full of
employes who were through with their
day's work. Among them was Jos.
Gregor, shift boss and timberman.
Gregor with two others was standing
on the edge of tho skip, holding on to
tho cable, while the *kip was filled with
employes. This is the usual way of
lowering down or hoisting men from
the mine. About half way up, on this
particular trip, it was noticed that
something was amiss with the bell wire.
This wire is a small cable, about a
quarter of an Inch in diameter, and
composed of a number of strands of
small wires. It is the only means of
communication between those in the
shaft and the engineer. Even while in
the act of ascending the shaft it is pos
sible in case of emergency to signal to
the engineer by means of the bell wire.
Above the 700 level it was realized from
the amount of slack that the wire had
parted some distance above. It became
at once a source of danger to those rid
ing on the skip. While there is a
pliancy about the cable, there is also
sufficient stiffness about it to cause it
to remain in the shaft and coil up as
the skip continued to ascend." There
was the bell wire in the other compart
ment, but this was beyond reach.
There is no doubt the unfortunate vic
tim realized the situation, and tried to
avert the disaster which followed.
The precise way he lost his balance
and fell is not known. lie was riding
on that side of the shaft where the
broken wire would cause tho most dan
ger. Whether in trying to push the
slack wire away, or whether he en
deavored to escape by the centre brace,
we cannot say. He was noticed to fall
backward, and disappear in the shaft.
The shaft is an incline, over 1300 feet
deep. Death, or at least unconscious
ness, probably ensued before the victim
had fallen many feet. The body went
Into the sump, which contained con
siderable water. The skip was lowered
as soon as possible. Some articles of
clothing belonging to deceased were
found at the 900 level. The work of
un watering the sump was prosecuted
with all possible speed, and about nine
o'clock tho body was recovered. The
news of the sad event spread over the
town in a few minutes, and at the time
the body was brought to the surface, a
crowd of people, estimated at several
hundred, gathered at the mouth of the
shaft, mournfully watching the pro
ceedings. The remains were mutilated
sadly, especially about the head. They
wore taken to tho deceased's residence
on Stump street, near Marre's hotel.
Deceased was 39 years of age, a native
of England. He leaves a.wife and two
children, the oldest a girl of ten years,
the other a boy five years old. Mrs.
Gregor was distracted with grief when
the terrible news was broken to her.
For some time she was hysterical.
Deceased had been working at the
Zeila for over sixteen years. He was
an expert workman, and one of the
trusted employes of the company. He
was moreover universally esteemed by
his fellow workmen. His untimely and
tragic end has cast a gloom over the
community such as has not been ex
perienced for years.
Coroner Huberty is holding an in
quest this aflornoou as we go to press.
The jurors were out this morning to
view the body, and also at the mine.
Some of them went down the shaft and
examined tho bell wire. To all out
ward appearance the wire was sound,
and its defective character could not
be detected until revealed by a break.
The funeral is announced to take
place to-morrow afternoon. Deceased
was a member of tho K. of P. and A.
O. U. W. organizations. He was also
a member of Jackson Miners' Union,
W. P. of M., of which organization he
was elected a. trustee at the electioq.
held last month-

Superintendent Riddick Resigns.
The San Francisco Chronicle says
that J. B. Riddick, who for the past
four years has filled the responsible
position of superintendent of the
Preston Reform school at lone, has
sent in his resignation, to take effect in
December next. With many who de
sire the welfare of this institution, this
action on the part of the superintend
ent will be regretted. The place is an
arduous one; not every good man can
manage a reformatory of this kind with
credit. It must be admitted that under
Dr. Riddick's care the school has been
free from the rumors of scandal and
mismanagement that havo marked it
in previous years. The boys have been
contented and happy; tho attempts to
escape have been few. That he has
not pleased everybody is not to be
wondered at. That feat is beyond the
reach of human accomplishment. Pub
lic interests will be well served if his
successor proves as capable and efficient
in tho management of the school as the
retiring superintendent has proved
himself.

Distress After Eating Cored.
Judge W. T. Holland of Greensburg,
La., who is well and favorably known,
says: "Two years ago I suffered great
ly from indigestion. After eating,
great distress would invariably result,
lasting for an hour or so, and my
nights were restless. I concluded to
try Kodol Dyspepsia Cure and it cured
me entirely. Now my sleep is refresh
ing and digestion perfect." Sold by
City Pharmacy, Jackson.
Burned by A Live Wire.
This morning, about 10 o'clock, Jas.
M. Stamps, employed as a lineman by
tho Standard Electric Company, was
severely and perhaps fatally burned by
coming in contact with a live wire. As
far as we can learn from the meager
particulars received, the victim was en
gaged in soldering, and came in con*
taot with a live wire carrying 2000
yolts. He was terribly burned about
the arm and leg and one side. Dr.
Endicott repaired to the scene. We
learn that the victim will be taken to
the city today for treatment. Hiscaso
is a critical one, and recovery is doubt
ful. Stamps is a single man, about 30
years of age, and has been in the employ
of the Standard Company for about
three years.

A Complimentary Send-off.
The Rev. Dr. Phelps, the newly ap
pointed pastor of the M. E. church, for
the past throe years has had charge of
the church at Reno, Nevada. That he
ha 3 given the utmost satisfaction in
that field is evinced by the flattering
testimonials he has received not only
from the press but from Individual
members of the church. The Reno
Gazette of Sept. 6, speaking of the rev.
gentleman's departure from that place
says:
"Under the administration of Dr.
Phelps the Methodist church has had
an era of the greatest prosperity and
upbuilding.
In this short time over two hundred
have been taken into the church— the
membership more than doubled. The
parish has been in perfect harmony at
all times, as the healthy financial con
dition will indicate.
During the pastorage of Dr. Phelps,
funds to the amount of $8000 have been
raised in the parish, and the last year's
funds alone amounted to $3,277.50.
Dr. Phelp's earnest work has been far
reaching, and the results of his efforts
can never be defaced. r»5-"S
Especially among' the younger mem
bers of his church he has created a de
sire for advancement in the church
work. The Junior League has a mem
bership of thirty-seven, the Boys' Club
has thirty-two members, and the Ep
worth League has a membership of one
hundred enthusiastic members. ■ • i
Dr. Phelps seemed to have many re
grets at leaving the people he has
labored among for the past three years,
but for domestic reasons he has decided
to go."

DOCTORS' BLUNDERS:
What Legal Methods Applied to Mcd-
leal Practice Would Uncover.
"Now that I am through with medi
cine 1 can speak of the profession in a
fashion that I would not if I was still
in the practice," said a gentleman who
has been known as a successful physi
cian in Xew York for years as he sal
at luncheon in toe Lawyers' club.
"Of course I don't care to have my
name mentioned, for I have lots of good
friends in the profession, but the fact
Is that the profession of medicine would
be nearly ruined if it had to be con
ducted aR you gentlemen of the bar
practice your calling.
"We have a great advantage over
you, for you in your cases are subject
ed to the extremest publicity, while we
in our cases have the utmost conceal
ment. Just suppose that in our cases
we had a judge who knew as much as
or more than we did presiding over our
actions and, worse than that, had an
other physician, whose interests were
not ours, watching and criticising us
at every step and blazoning every er
ror that we made. Dear me, such a
prospect as that would frighten the
best physician who ever lived the mo
ment he entered a sick, room, and yet
that condition is just what you men
of the law have to face in every caw
that you try. :;'■-.. ; : ..
"What sort of a figure would a law
yer cut floundering around in court
without any knowledge of his case?
But a physician can flounder mentally
In a sick room without a second person
being the wiser, though the patient
may suffer; but, then, 'dead men tell
no tales.'
"Under such circumstances of doubt
which is usually ignorance, the physi
cian can look wise, put something Into
the patient's stomach, go to his office,
decide what line of experiment he will
follow, return the next day, hoping to
find that nature is working the cur«
that he doesn't know how to effect, and
being ready and willing to take all of
the credit that comes his way.
"Why, the very first thing that nurses
are taught is to observe the utmost se
crecy about doctors' blunders. If they
told what they know there wouldn't be
much confidence in physicians where
they are heard. Ask a nurse of expe
rience about this when you have the
opportunity.
"Yes, sir, I repeat that the publicity
and chance for criticism in your pro
fession, if applied to medicine, would
result in the discovery of a small
amount of science . as compared with
the large amount of empiricism."— New
York Herald.
FRUITS AND FLOWERS.
It never injures an orchard to ma
nure it.
Judicious annual pruning is essential
with the peach.
Low headed trees resist the wind
better, and the fruit is more easily
picked. - ":>
In grafting a large tree it is best not
to try to graft the whole tree in one
season.
Budding on certain slow growing and
somewhat incongruous stock ' is the
best way of dwarfing.
In most cases the cause of moss ap
pearing on the stems of apple and oth
er fruit trees is wet, cold, undralned
land.
■ The soil for roses should be rich and
of such tenacity that it will hold to
gether when pressed. Sand and clay
mixed is good.
All wood that is more than two years
old should be cut out from the currants
and gooseberries. They will produce
more fruit, even if the vines are not to
large. >-;
An Economical Mother.
Small Katherine, who had been for
bidden to touch the Ink bottle, had ac
cidentally spilled Its contents not only
all over her mother's desk, but on the
rug, several chairs and her own apron.
Her mother, on discovering the state of
affaire, had expressed more surprise
than pleasure. When the father of the
family returned at night his little
daughter met him at the door and
asked :
"Papa, how much does a- bottle of ink
cost?"
"Oh, about 5 cents."
"Five crnts!" exclaimed the aggrieved
youngster in a tone of deep disgust
"And to think that mamma would
make all that fuss about one little bot
tle of ink!"— Lippincott's.
"Arc Ton Ready T Go!"
Mrs. John Peters was the mother of
a family of restless children, and she
found difficulty in reducing them to
quiet when the moment came for ask
ing a blessing at the table. So her
course of procedure was something in
this fashion:

SAFE OPENING TOOLS.
Implements of Which Burglars Se-r.
er Even Get a Glimpse.
"We have tools for opening safes,"
said the foreman of the machine room
of a safe factory, "that no burglar
could Imitate even if he got them. But
it would be one of the most difficult
things in the world for him to get even
a sight of them. The tool room is
guarded as closely as a bank vault A
watchman stays in it all night. We are
Tery careful about employing our men.
They must give bonds and have the
best of references. The chance of a
burglar getting into our employ for the
purpose of learning our methods is
scarcely worth thinking about.
"Very frequently we have hurry calls
for a man to open a safe where the
time clock has gone askew or where the
clerk has forgotten the combination.
You can readily imagine that with a
bank or trust company it is an essen
tial thing to have the safe open before
business begins. When we send a
man out he takes a wagon load of tools,
for he must open the safe without ruin
ing the lock, and he does not know pre
cisely what the trouble is. He carries
a photograph of himself with our cre
dentials on it. Nor will he open. the
safe while alone. Some bank official
must remain with him, no matter how
long the job takes. That is for our own
protection. Some very queer alleged
robberies have been charged to men
sent out to open safes. .
"To mechanics in our business it is
laughable to read that a full kit of bur
glars' tools has been found beside a
safe. As I have said, it would require
an express wagon to carry them, and
burglars don't work that way. If they
care to take chances by blowing up a
safe with dynamite it is another mat
ter; but those fellows nearly always
get caught. .
"A police officer told me that burglars
make their own tools. The big crooks
are all spotted and are afraid to go out
and buy the material for them. Some
of them send their wives and children."
—Philadelphia Ledger.
POULTRY POINTERS.
The best way to feed corn to young
chickens is cracked or crushed.
A good dust bath will go far toward
keeping fowls in good condition.
Clear, raw corn meal wet with water
is not a good feed for young ducklings
at any time.
Destroy the nest of a sitting hen as
soon as the chickens are a day old.
Give her a new nest and burn the old
one.
Separated early and raised up by
themselves, pullets are worth at least
25 per cent more for use than if al
lowed to run with a lot of cockerels.
On the farm if more than one breed
is kept it is necessary that they be
kept separate, and one or the other
must be kept confined part of the time.
It is important to keep the young
turkeys dry until they are about eight
weeks old, and even then they should
be strong and well developed. Damp
ness is almost always fatal to young
turkeys.
Religions Training; of Japanese.
Little or no importance is attached
to the religious training of Japanese
children. Whether the parents be
Buddhists or Shintoists it matters not,
for in either case the children rarely
take any part in the religious life of
their parents or elders, and indeed
usually grow up in blissful ignorance
as to what it is all about True, they
may occasionally be taken to the tem
ple and taught torub their palms to
gether, clap thrice and incline their
heads toward the shrine as they tons
their offering of rin through the wood
en grating of the huge money till.
They may have some vague notion
that there is something meritorious in
all this, but nothing more, although
every ' Japanese home has a latticed
niche, or kamidana, dedicated to the
service of the household Lares and
Penates, or Dalkoku and Eblsu as they
appear in Japan.
No Reptiles In Newfoundland.
Everybody knows that there are no
snakes in Ireland, but very few know
that Newfoundland is just like Ireland
in that respect, and there is no record
that Newfoundland had a St Patrick
to drive the snakes off either. There
Is plenty of game in Newfoundland,
but not a reptile of any kind — snake,
toad, frog, lizard or even turtle. An
other queer thing about the province is
that while some wild animals are
abundant there no one ever saw a
squirrel, porcupine, mouse or lynx any
where within its boundaries. This is
all the more singular because the ad
joining provinces of Nova Scotia and
Cape Breton have all these animals
and many kinds of snakes and other
reptiles.
An Achievement.
"I don't see wny you should be so
proud of winning that case," said the
intimate friend. "You were plainly In
the wrong."
"You don't understand these things
at all," answered the lawyer. "That's
the very thing . that makes me so
proud."— Exchange.

YELLOWSTONE CANYON.
At First Its Blsness and Barbaric
Color Are Overpowering;*
Imagine, if you can— but you never
can— a mighty cleft in the level earth
a third of a mile wide, its brinks sharp,
precipitous, reaching over 1,200 feet
downward, sometimes almost perpen
dicular, sometimes banked with huge
heaps of talus or buttressed with spin
dling pinnacles and towers often sur
mounted wfth eagle nests, and all
painted, glowing with the richest color
—vast patches of yellow and orange,
Btreaklngs of red and blue, with here
a towering abutment of red and there
another all of yellow. At the bottom
flows the gleaming green river, and at
the top the dark green forest reaches
to the canyon edge, and sometimes
even rugged and gnarled pines, the van
guard of the wr-ri, venture over the
precipice to find footing on some ledge
or to hang, half dislodged, with angular,
dead arms reaching out into the mighty
depths, a resting place for soaring
eagle or hawk. The sides of the can
yon being - not of solid rock, but of
crumbling, soft formation, have fur
nished plastic material for the sculp
turing of water and wind, which have
tooled them into a thousand fantastic
forms. One's eye traces out gigantic
castles, huge dog forms, bird forms, ti
tanic faces— all adding to the awful im
pressiveness of the place.
For miles the canyon stretches north
ward from .the lower falls. From
numerous well guarded outlooks the
spectator, grasping hard upon the rail
ing lest the dizziness of these heights
unnerve him, may. behold a hundred
varied views of the grandeur, looking
either toward the falls, which seem to
fill the canyon end like a splendid white
c-olunin of marble, or off to the north
ward, where the stupendous gorge
widens out, loses some of its coloring,
admits more of the forest and finally
disappears among rugged mountains.
Everywhere the view is one that
places the seal of awed silence upon the
lips. It never palls, never grows old.
One soon sees all too much of geyser
and paint pot; of this, never. At first
the sensation of savage immensity is
bo overpowering that the spectator
gathers only, a confused sense of big
ness and barbaric color, but when he
has made the perilous descent to the
canyon bottom below the falls, when
he has seen the wonder from every
point of view, he begins to grasp a
larger part of the whole scene, to form
a picture which will remain with him.

Wine of Cardui reinforces the organs
of generation for the ordeal of preg-
nancy and childbirth. It prevents mis-
carriage. No woman who takes Wine
of Carclui need fear the coming of her
child. If Mrs. Unrath had taken
Wine of Cardui before her baby came
she would not have been weakened as .
she was. Her rapid recovery should
commend this great remedy to every
expectant mother. Wine of Cardui
regulates the menstrual flow.
