Hallcy's Comet and —
Eclipse a Pretty Sight.
Monday night the total eclipse or the
moon and Halley's comet presented an
astronomical attraction to the sight seers
that has never been witnessed before by
any living being. In Jackson the night
was beautifully clear. The clouds that
hung in the amtosphere the greater part
of the day, oil disappeared as night
came on, leaving a clear sky for the
observation of this striking phenomena.
And everyone in town took advantage of
the occasion to get to some point where
comet and moon could be seen. As the
face of the moon became obscured, and
darkness gradually grew deeper, the
comet loomed up a strinkingly beauti
fully object. The nucleus was not bril
liant as when seen in the eastern sky,
stlil it beamed out as a star of the first
magnitude, while Its tail seemed to
stretch over one fourth the firmament.

INJURED MINERS
GO TO ENGLAND
Rickard of Argonaut and
Donahue of Zeila
Leave Jackson
Sam Rickard and John Donohue left
Jackson Wednesday morning bound for
their native land, England. They were
both miners, the first named employed
at the Argonaut and the other at the
Zeila mine. They were both crippled
severely while engaged in the mine a
few months ago. Rickard had the calf
of one leg badly torn about three months
ago. Gratfing had to be lesorted to in
restoring the damage. He was laid up
for many weeks, and at the time he
left he was able to get around without a
cane, but the effects of the injury are by
no means entirely removed. A collec
tion was taken up from the employes,
amounting to over $250, and all ex
penses of surgery and nursing etc.,
were paid.
Donohue was treated in an equally
liberal manner at the Zeila. His fellow
workers came to his aid and contributed
a shift for liis benefit. The company
also dealt with him liberally, and after
reaching his destination he will have a
snug balance. Donahue lost his right
arm while at work in the stope. After
firing a blast ha and his partner went to
the face, neglecting to see that the over
hanging roof was sound. A rock fel
en his right a r m, crushing it so badly
that it hud to be amputated. The acci
dent happened in March last. He re
turns to relatives in the old country.
Impressive Services
for Memorial Day
Memorial day will be observed on
Sunday, May 29, under the auspices of
Rathbone Lodge, K. of P. The pro
cession headed by the Jackson Military
band and Uniform Rank, will form In
front of the National hotel at 2p. m.,
and march to the cemetery, where ap
propriate exercises will be held and
graves decorated. All fraternal orders
are invited to participate.
Memorial day exercises will be held
next Sunday afternoon at lone, under
the auspices of the Foresters. Superior
Judge Fred V. Wood will deliver the
oration on that occasion.
W. G. Snyder will deliver the ad
dress in Jackson next Sunday at the
memorial day exercises under the aus
pices of the Knights of Pythias.
Funeral of A. Grillo.
The funeral of August Grillo was held
last Sunday morning at Volcano. The
body was conveyed from Jackson to that
town Saturday evening, quite a number
of citizens accompanying the remains to
the deceased's former home. Services
were conducted in the Cathoilc church
at Volcano by Rev. Father Traverno
There was a very large attendance, citi
zens from every part of the county as
sembling to pay the last tribute of res
pect to the deceased, who was cut down
in the prime of manhood, and zenith of
his usefulness. The Native Sons of Ex
celsior parlor, of which parlor deceased
was a member, was largely represented
at he ceremonies. The floral offerings
were numerous and of the most elabo
rate character in design and artisic
effect. Amid the tears of the bereaved
relatives, and the deeply felt sorrow of
the community in general, the mortal
clay was deposited in its final rest in the
Volcano cemetery.
REPUBLICANS
HOLD MEETING
Consider Vacancy On
Board of Super-
visors
A meeting of republican county cen
tral committee was held in the office of
the chairman, Dr. A. M. Gall in Jack
son on Tuesday evening. The principal
object of the meeting was to consider
the supervisor question in township
three, a. vacancy being created by the
death of August Grillo. There were
present at the meeting the following
committeemen. Dr. A. M. Gall, W.
D. Durfene, H. E. Kay, from township
one, Clarence Bradshaw, township 3,
and C. E. Richards, from townhis 4.
Claud Wilson was represented by proxy
held by C. Bradshaw.
L. H. Cook and F. B. Joyce were
present from township 3, as aspirants
for appointment to fill the • vacancy in
the supervisorship. It was also reported
thatW. E. Smith and Geo. Miller had
also been mentioned in connection with
that office.
The matter was discussed, the pre
vailing opinion being that it would be
unwise for the committee as a whole to
take any action at this time. The ap
pointment concerned primarily the citi
zens of township 3, the rest of the
county having merely an indirect in
terest therein. Tiie voters of that town
ship would be called upon to elect a
supervisor nt the general election in
November; it would therefore be un

Italian Picnic
To be Big Affair
All arrangements have been made for
the celebration of the annual Italian
picnic to be held at Fullen's Grove near
Martell station on June 5, next. A
game of ball will be played between
Sutter Creek and Jackson and many
other interesting fetures have been pre
pared. The committee in charge have
the minor details all cared for and pro
mise all who attend, a day of pleasure.
Cherries Plentiful.
Reports from farmers in the surround
ing country say that cherries are abund
ant this year. Whole wagon loads are
shipped to the small towns and sold and
many shipped out to the county. The
selling price on the streets are 5 cents
per pound, and the demand for them
seems to be good.
Next week the large white specie will
be on the market. They are considered
the best for canning, the supply is re
ported as being extremely good this
MINERS UNION
GOES TO WALL
Membership Falls Away
And Expenses Pile
on Charter
Jackson Miner's Union, No. 115, W.
F. M., is no more. After a stormy
birth, and a struggling existence for
seven or eight years, it was compelled
by force of adverse conditions to surren*
der its charter, and close up its affairs.
In the prime of its power there were
500 members in the organization, with
other unions in the county, bringing up
the strength of the federation members in
Amador county to fully 1000. Rut after
the first impetjs of the movement lead
ing to the strike about seven years ago,
interest commenced to wane. The
membership began to fall away, and the
revenue to decline. The unions in
other parts of the county, at Sutter
Creek and Amador City, were disbanded
several years ago, the one at Gwin mine
was disrupted by the closing down of
that mine several years ago. Jackson
union held out to the last. This, how
ever, was being slowly but surely
sapped away by a combination of un
toward circumstances. The last disas
trous strike over the intepretation of
the eight hour law, hastened the in
evitable end.
The membership dropped off so rapid
ly, that the receipts were no longer able
to meet the expenses. The payment of
dues to disabled or sick member became
uncertain, and this helped along the
disorganization. At the last it is re
ported that less than 20 members were
in good standing, and this was unequal
to keep up dues to the parent orga
nization, pay the secretary and rent of

New Band Master
May Locate Here
Prof. T. F. Erman, a musician of ex
ceptional ability is stopping in Jackson
for a short time, looking over a field of
work which is held out to him, by the
local band. Erman wss in charge of the
band at the Preston Industrial School at
lone, about 3 years ago, and since has
been employed by a musical house in
San Francisco as an agent, and to take
care of piano tuning departments, etc.
It is claimed that the professor is an
artist in each instrument he teaches,
which includes all the instruments in
the band and orchestra. The band is
asked tojjguarantee a nominal amount in
order to warrant him to leave his pre
sent employment and come here. This
we learn is not made possible as yet,
owing to a lack of scholars to be had on
piano, etc.
The fact that Jackson band" needs a
good band leader cannot be questioned
if the oragnization wishes to be rated
anywhere, and it is to be hoped some
means will be found to warrant a teach
ers coming here.

Amador Co.
Argonaut
This company paid its customary
monthly dividend of five cents per share
on the 20th, amounting to $10,000. The
company is having surveys and maps
made for the approaching trial of the
suit brought by the Kennedy Extension
for trespass and damages to the tune of
$700,000. The date of trial is not vet
fixed, but the defendant corporation is
anxious to have the issue decided as
early as possible. The 40 stamp mill is
kept running steadily, the prospects of
the mine are as bright as ever, the ore
surrendering gold in gratifying quantity.
Keystone
The conditions at the Keystone mine
remains about the same. The tie up by
legal proceedure looks as though it will
mean sometime before the old standby
will again turn its wheels and crush ore
for bullion. The effect of the shutdown
is greatly felt in Amador, as the small
revenue paid into the town each month
was badly needed. ■;;;■<
South Eureka.
Everything above ground is a bustle
and rush at this mine. The new mill
under course of construction is fast near
ing completion, and will be equipped
with the very latest machinery. The new
foundations for the powerful hoist
be installed are finished and the machine
is on the ground ready to be erected.
Concrete pillars have been set upon
which will rest the new gallows frame
soon to be erected. The new frame
will tower more than a hundred feet
higher than the present scaffold.
The Mokelumne Hill correspondent of
the Calaveras Citizen says*
It is confidently believed here that the
Hamby mine will soon start up with
Amador county capital.
Tarn Has 111 Health
Wm. Tarn left yesterday morning for

HOSPITAL GETS
NEW PLUMBING
Building In Bad Need for
Repairs at Present
Underway
Much needed repairs at the county
hospital are under way, and the institu
tion will undergo a complete overhaul
ing under the management of the present
supt., D. J. Burke.
The pipes furnishing the institution
with water were all found to be in the
most filthy condition inside, and short
pieces of inch pipes were so clogged
with mud that it was impossible to see
through them. Much of the piping was
laid over 20 years ago and never cleaned,
and conditions were so bad that but a
small quantity of water could be forced
into the building. The tanks in the
toilets were half full of mud. and all
badly leaking. These have also been
relined and put in working order. The
new piping is all being so placed as to
be accessable for any emergency.
Many needed repairs have been allowed
to go unfixed in order to keep running
expenses down. This brings the pre
sent management under expense, which
must be faced, and supt. Burke, is as
far as can be noted, using excellent
judgment in the work of replumbing the
building. The contract has been let to
George Weller, and special attention is
paid to the repiping, by placing stop
cocks etc. at places where they can be
conveniently reached, instead of crawl
ing along rafters under porches, as was
heretofore the case. This makes the
chances of a disaster by tire less pos
sible, and insures better sanitary condi
tions in Mushing pipes.

ENGLEBRIGHT FOR CONGRESS.
W. F. Englebright, who has represented the first district
for the past four years, is a candidate for renoinination ou
the republican ticket. Superior judge John L. Childs of Del
Norte county is also announced as an apiraut for this office
on the republican side. He is highly recommended by the
press of his home county, and we have no doubt he is every
way fitted for this position of responsibility and honor. Ad
mitting all this, we see no reason why the republican
party should make any change of candidate at this time. No
flaw can be found in the official record of Englebright. He
has V made good in every sense of the phrase. Throughout
the district his contituents are perfectly satisfied with his
work. He has been a faithful servant in all things. Men
of more brilliance in oratory have graced the halls of con-*
gress, but a more tireless worker for the interests of his dis
trict, or of sounder judgment in directing his efforts toward
the desired end, than W. F. Englebright,"has rarely if ever
been seen in the national legislature. The passage of the
bill creating a mining bureau was mainly due to his efforts.
He has lost no opportunity to favor- the mining interest,
which is the paramount industry of his] district. It is poor
policy to change a congressman frequently. It takes one
term to initiate a representative ginto the ways of congress,
and a veteran member can accomplish far more for his dis
trict than a novice. The older states are fully alive to this
fact. When they secure an able and faithful member of con
gress, they aim to keep him in office, knowing his influence
as a rule grows with each successive term. This is a policy
that California will do well to pattern after. We believe the
voters of the first congressional district £are content to let
well enough alone, and will retain Euglebright in the office
he has filled so well for the past years.
The agitation for government ownership of public utilities
is pressed to. the extreme of absurdity. The conservation
policy in behalf of which so much is being said and written,
is the outgrowth of the government ownership question, and
the drift of the whole matter is strongly toward socialism.
To prevent the undue waste of national resources by the
creation of vast forest reserves, where the spoiler's ax is not
permitted except under strict protective regulations, is a
move that no one can object to. But when mineral lands,
water power sites, oil lands, are proposed to be withdrawn
from private entry, with the object in view of the general gov
ernment either renting these resources or opening and operat
ing them for the benefit of the people, that seems like drifting
far out to sea. Even in private enterprises along these lines
the failures are many, while the successes are few. True,
stupendous fortunes have been piled up by a few individuals
in such enterprises, but if the truth were fully known, the
unfortunate adventures outnumber the successes. This rule
applies' to every branch of business. The world is so con
stituted that it must ever remain so, because the inequality
arises mainly from the differences in human* 'nature. Now
the government is but an aggregation of individuals. Its
ability to score financial success must be measured by the
capacity of the individuals charged with its management,
with the powerful incentive of self-interest supplanted b3' a
vague desire for the general welfare. It is contrary to all ex
perience that governmental affairs be carried on with the
same regard to economy as under private management. The
notion tbat all the people will participate in the profits under
government ownership, as against the few beneficiaries of
privately owued concerns, is a dream of impracticable re
formers.
We have reason to believe that a few voters have, from
indifference or other causes, failed to get on the great
register as party meu, when as a matter of fact they are such.
As the date for the primary election draws near, they will
regret their action, inasmuch as unless rectified, they will be
barred from the opportunity of helping their party friends by
their vote. We believe that oversights of this kind may be
corrected upon a proper showing within the prescribed time.
We hope all republicans who are not registered as such, will
make early application to have their party affiliation inserted
in the record.

The tides, rainfall, annual snows and
varying nir pressure are constantly
shifting enormous weights, and the
earth's crust is bent and deformed under
ths strain to a degree that is just be
ginning to be appreciated. Some years
ago Prof. John Milne, the veteran seis
mologist, showed that valleys are made
wider by day than at night through the
expansive action of the sun's heat. By
seismographic records of the Snide ob
servatory, he also proved that the Isle of
Wight is alternately moved forward and
backward by the tides, and that it is
tilted up from the English Channel side
at high water by the greater pressure on
that side. His latest observations have
been made with an extra-sensitive
seismograph placed underground nt
Bidston Observatory near Liverpool,
about two miles from the water. The
records obtained with a photographic re
corder prove that the sides of the basin
are drawn closer together at every high
tide by the sagging of the bed of the
Irish Sea, and the action can actually
be ' watched in the movement of the
seismograph pendulum. A collection of
about one inch in 16 miles is produced
by the weight of the tide off the mouth
of the Mersey.
There is discord in the bells of the
British houses of Parliament, and it
is protested that this is not in keeping
with the progress of science. In a
late Koyal Institution discussion, it was
stated that, taking the nominal tones
only, Big .Ben and the third quarter
bell are perfect octaves, as they should
be. The first-quarter bell is 20 vibrations
sharp; the second-quarter bell, 8 vibra-
ions sharp; and the fourth-quarter bell
s slightly flat, not more than 3 vibra-
tions. The humming and the striking
notes in all the bells are never less than
a semitone — sometimes a whole tone —
sharp or flat. In the last ten vcars
England has made great improvement in
the tuning of bells, and it is urged
that the national bells— which could be
tuned for 6,ooo— 'should be the very
best.
The projectile of the 12-inch gun
penetrates 22- inches of armor plate,
and has pierced a 20-foot concrete wall

The feeble sounds made by our body
engine at work have much significance,
and new importance has been given to
them by the telephone-stethoscope,
which the other day enabled a number
of physicians in the Isle of Wight to
listen to the heart- beats "of a lady in
London. In ordinary practice, tapping
over the region and other near-at hand
observations are depended upon in ad
dition to the indications of the stethos
cope. The intensified sounds are made
very distinctly, audible in the tele
phone, however, so that any irregulari-
ties are easily detected, and medical
men have expressed the belief that with
proper training of the ear it will become
practical to diagnose heart disease at
a distance. There is very little inter
ference from extraneous noises. Other
sounds can te transmitted, and it is
probable that examinations of the lungs
can be made as well as those of the
heart. The new instrument gives the
busy physiciau a means of watching a
serious pneumonia or ' typhoid case
without leaving his home, while country
patients may be enabled to consult the
heart specialists without the expense of
a trip to the city.
The chilled iron produced by the pro
cess of E. A. Custer is reported to be
a greyish iron and not the usual white
chilled iron. It is made from common
foundry iron— fairly high in silicon
ond low in sulphur and phosphorus —
which is run direct from the foundry
cupola into a chilled mold. In a few
moments, as soon as soildified, it is
quenched in water or other suitable
bath. It is claimed that the casting
makes a cutting tool of excellent
quality. It is suggested that the chilling
produces a fine and uniform structure,
and that the quenching fixes it.
By meuns of a box divided by a par
tition of porous porcelain, Dr. A. Di
Legge, an Italian physicist, indicates
the presence of light or heavy gases in
the air of mines, chemical works or
submarines. When the air or gases in
the two chambers have different den
sities, the gas diffusion from one com
partment to the other is irregular, and
the irregularity operates a small mer
cury index, which closes an electric
contact and rings a bell.; With two bells
jf different tone, the apparatus will in
jicnte the side on whic'.i the disturbing
causa is acting.
Hy the automatic electric mechanism
of a Scotch mariner. Bailie ,1. C. Bogle
of Falkirk, the compass is placed In
control of the steeting gear, and keeps
a vessel on a predetermined course
withnut aid from the* helmsmnn. A
finely-adjusted insulated lever, called
the contrator, has one end connected to
the compass card, and is so constructed
that the opposite end may make contact
with either of two terminals, or con
tractor rods connected with reversing
electric motor that moves the steering
apparatus. As the ship swerves from
its direction, the contractor makes con
tact t'n.it completes an electric circuit
giving port or starboard helm as may be
required. The ordinary steering me
chanism is retained unchanged, and the
controlling attachment can be promptly
disconnected when necessary, as when
the vessel's course must be changed to
avoid an obstruction or another vessel.
The "lobster pearl" found in a lobster
at Orient Point, L. 1., In July, 1907,
has been preserved by Alfred Eno, of
Jamaica, N. Y. It is a quarter of an
inch in diameter, neurlv round but not
smooth, has a light'buff color resemb
ling the shell, and lacks the laminated
structure of the ordinary pearl. Its
luster is not greater than that of becs_
wax, while it has a waxy fracture— not
brittle nor cbnchoidal. After careful
examination, a New York dealer decided
it to be really a kind of pearl, and ns
good a one as a lobster can be expected
to make. Making a more scientific in
vestigation, Prof. F. H. Herrick, of
Western Reserve University, has
reached a different., conclusion. He
finds that the substance was attached to
the shell, and decides that it is in no
sense a pearl, but was an ingrowth of
the shell due to some injury.
The Illinois tests of Prof. S. W. Parr
and W. F. Wheeler seem to have shown
that the chief losses in the storage of
large quantities of coal are due to break
ing up into dust and to fires from spon
taneous combustion. The maximum
loss from weathering was not more than
3}- 2 ' per cent in Illinois coal stored a
year. Other experimenters have
differed, and have • reported a loss in
calorific power from weathering as high
as 25 per cent.
Dies as Result of
Motocycle injuries
Oakland, May 9.— \V. H. George, a
well-known real estate dealer of this
city^rted from injuries sustained, when
he was struck by a motocycle at East
Fourteenth street and Seminary avenue.
George was a native of Canada, and
until he came west several years ago
was connected with the railroads at
Chicago. He leaves a widow and one
daughter. He was the son-in-law of
Judge VC. S. Williams of 489 Orchard
avenue and the brother-in-law of Rupert
Whitehead and Robert ' Mills, both of
this city. He was 51 years old and
was a prominent Elk and Mason.
The deceased was well known
throughout Amador county. He was
formerly connected with the Realty Syn
dicate of Oakland and a number of
Amador people were led to invest in
the securities of that company through
his instrumentality. Only a month ago
he was in Jackson and other parts of
the county, inviewing the holders of
Realty Syndicate certificates for the pur
pose of exchanging these securities for
stock in the Oakland Traction company.

Roscville Sends
Bts "Peeping Tom.
Kosevillc, Placer Co.— Roseville has a
"Peeping Tom, " but no sooner was his
presence discovered than he was prompt
ly apprehended, and sentenced to fifty
days on the Auburn chain gang by Judge
Clark.
The "Peeping Tom" was no less a
personage than a negro bearing the
name of Lindsay, and he was arrested
following upon the complaint of a resi
dent on Grant street that he was peering
into her windows/
Lindsay was discovered in the act of
peeping into a bathroom window, and
was let off with a few well administered
cuffs, but his arrest was not made until
this morning. When hale before the
court he pleaded guilty, and was prompt
ly sentenced to fifty days.
Several months ago he was givn a
sentence of 100 days on the chain i ing
on a petty larceny charge, but was re
leased on parole on the requests of
friends.

friends of 40 years ago. A man whom
I had thought dead in the long lapse of
time that has passed since I last saw
him. He was one of the jurors that
gave Alma Bell her freedom after kil
ling her lover, Joe Armes. By this
means, I found that he was still alive.
1 wrote him and received an answer
soon. He invited me over to see him,
and he wanted me to examine 840
acres of mineral land that he was lately
interested in. I withold his name
for the essential reason, that 1 am
going to give the readers of the Ledger
a chance to read two black hand letters
that were wrtten to the gentleman while
he was sitting on the jury. Sheriff
McCuley received one also. But before
proceeding with the letters, I will take
up my journey which may interest
many of the readers of the Ledger.
On the 11th day of this month I
started from the Caldor sawmills, where
they saw and ship 75,000 feet of lumber
per day. A narrow-sauge railroad. 32
miles in length, runs from, Diamond to
the mill, and is owned by the same com
pany. At 12.40 p. in. 1 seated myself
in the caboose car that was headed for
Diamond Springs. At 4.15 we were
standing at the Southern Pacific depot in
Diamond. Here 1 waited for two hours
and a half for the passenger train to take
me on to Placerville. The next morning
just as dawn was breaking over the hilis
and all Placerville was asleep, I seated
myself in the stage to take me on to
Auburn. The driver was a young man
of genial companionship, probably just
out of his teens. He drove a spanking
span of spirited horses that champed
with fiery spirit against the bits. The
road proved to be smooth, but it wound

its way in a labrynthine course over
lidges, across flats, and past farmhouses
scattered like birds through this moun
tainous country,
An hour brought us to the world-famous
town of Coloma, where Marshall discov
ered gold in the old mill tailrace in 1848.
The town of pioneer days has tumbled to
ruins. A few old houses, torn and dilap
idated, stand as the dpcaying relics of
bygone days, when a cosmopolitan popu
lation coming from all points of the com-
Dass trod its streets.
Off to the left of the town a few hun
dred yards distant upon a low round
knoll stands Marshall monument. The
statue stands in solitude facing the old
town, where the scorching sunshine of
summer strikes upon it, aud the winter
winds whistle mournfully around the
image of the man wlio in spirit has
Dassed to that bourne from whence no
traveler returns. He stands in a slightly
stooping posture holding in his left hand
an image of nuggets and pointing with
his ;long attenuted linger to the gold he
seems to be excited over. As I look
upon him a reflection comes over me.
Here is only the image of the man that
stands as sentinel overlooking the Amer
ican river and the historic town that has
gone to decay. Sutter, the mainspring
of all this discovery, has long since
crossed ;he divide. The pioneers have
wilted into insignificance. A few years
more all of them will be a thing of the
past. Then only can the native sons and
daughters look to the monument as a
relic of all this primitive greatness that
has swept into an everlasting past.
In this town McFiee was hung, who
had killed, according to his dying state
ment upon the scaffold, 17 men. Here,
too, Jeremiah E. Grain was hung for
killing Susan Newingham,a young school
girl, one of his pupils, whom he was
madly in love with, although he had a
wife and two baby girls in his faraway
home In the east. He was a school tea
cher, and a man of more than ordinary
ability. If 1 remember rightly, just
prior to the killing he was a candidate
on the Whig ticket for the legislature.
The stage stop here was of short dura
tion, and soon we were whirling on our
way down the American river on toward
Lotus. This place is merely a hamlet. It
might be named Store more appropriately
for there are two stores and not more
than half a dozen houses insight. Here
we got breakfast. The country from here
on is rough and mountainous generally
speaking. Like all other mountain coun
try, it is interspersed with small plateaus
upon which are nsat farm houses.
We are now nearing Pilot Hill, a town
that is old and dying with the pioneers.
All around is their work of the pick and
shovel. The graveyard on the little knoll
to the left doubtless claims some of
those sturdy miners of more than half a
century ago. Here, too, a girl, weak and
fragile, yet in her early teens, while
picking flowers witnessed a deadly com
bat between two brothers, one of whom
killed the other. This was in the early
50's.
The next place we came to was named
Cool. 1 suppose it was name in winter,
for the shale creeps from the soil in
many places, and in summer 1 take it to
be a place a few degrees cooler than the
place we are told of in the Bible. Here
too, is the junction of the wagon road,
one leading to Auburn the other to
Georgetown. We changed stages here,
taking the one coming from Georgetown,
while the other returns to Placerville.
From Cool we descended the steep
mountain side that lies on the .south
side of the middle fork of the American
river. As we start down the grade the
glistening waters shine upon the surface
as a burnished sheet of silver as it
winds its way, snakelike, through the
canyons below.
After a tedious ride we reach the old
suspension bridge— the oldest perhaps
in the state, for it has stood there in
tact for more than half a century. Up
the grade now we go where the suburbs
of Auburn sit like ancient citadels upon
the mountain top.
I now. reproduce the Black Hand letters
written to my old-time friend while he
sat upon the jury verbatim et literatim.
The superscription upon the envelope
Children Cry
FOR FLETCHER'S
CASTORIA
was thus ; .
"Mr Juror for WlsS Alma Bell,
Auburn, Gal."
.. They were postmarked San Francisco,
with immediate delivery stamp upon
each There is no date, no place desig
nated from whence they came, only the
postmark upon the envelope. My friend,
who is <* native of Canada, and American
by adoption, honest in his convictions
and firm in his determination, assured
me the letter cut no figure in his ver
dict. I leave now the readers of the
Ledger to form their own conclusions
as to tenor of the warning epistles. In
mv next letter I will describe the mining
country I went to visit and will also
compare the stretch of country now oc
cupied by well-regulated farms and fine
villas, with Amador county, which ranks
head and shoulders above it in my esti
mation.
Clins. S. Bell.
First Letter.
We let you know that if the Alma Bell

MAXIMS OF
MARK TWAIN
Full of Homely Wit and
of Deep and Good
Wisdom
Mark Twain selected this one to adorn
the page following the title of one or
his books:
"These wisdoms are for the luring of
youth toward high moral altitudes. The
author did not gather them from practice
but from observation. To be good is to
be noble; but to show others how to be
good is nobler and no trouble." Some
of the other maxims read :
"Noise proves nothing. Often a hen
who has merely laid an egg cackles as
if she had laid an asteroid."
"Training is everything. The peach
was once a bilter almond; cauliflower is
nothing but a cabbage with a college
education.
"The autocrat of Russia possesses
more power than any other man in the
earth ; but he can not stop a sneeze."
"Habit is habit, and not to be flung
out of the windows by any man, but
coaxed downstairs a step at a time."
"One of the most striking differences
between a cat and a lie is that a cat has
enly nine lives."
"When I reflect upon the number of
disagieeable people who I know have
gone to a better world, I am movel to
lead a different life."
"The true southern watermelon is a
boon apart and not to be mentioned with
commoner things. It is chief of this
world's luxuries, king by the grace of
God over all the fruits of the earth.
When one has tested it he knows what
the angels eat. It was not a southern
watermelon that Eve took ; we know it
because she repented.
"Begnod and ytu will be lonesome."
"Few things are harder to put up
with than the annoyance of a good ex
ample." %
"It were not best that I we should all
think alike; it is difference of opinion
that makes horse races."
. "Even the clearest and most perfect
circumstantial evidence is likely to he
at fault, after all, and, therefore ought
to be received with great caution. Take
the case of any pencil sharpened by any
woman; if you have witnesses, you will
find she did it with a knife; but if
you. take simply the aspect of the pencil
you will say she did it with her teeth."
"April I. This is the day upon whicn
we are reminded of what we are on the
other 304."
"The English are mentioned in the
bible; blessed are the meek for they
shall inherit the earth."
"Adam and Eve had many adventures,
but the principal one was that they es
caped teething."
"There is no character, however good
and fine, but it can be destroyed by
ridicule, howsoever poor and witless.
Observe the ass for instance ; his
character is about perfect; he is the
choisest spirit among all the humbler
animals, yet see what ridicule has
brought him to. Instead of feeling
complimented when we are called an
ass, we are left in doubt."
"Consider well the proportions of
things. It is better to be a young June
bug than an old bird of paradise."
"Why is it that we rejoice at a birth
and grieve at a funeral? It is because
we are not the person involved."
"All say, 'How hard it is to have to
die' — strange complaint to come from
the mouths of people who have to
live."
"It is easy to find fault, if one has
that disposition. There was once a
man who, not being able to lind any
other fault with his coal, complained
that there were too many prehistoric
toads in it."
' When angry, count four; when very
angry, swear."
"The holy passion of friendship is of
so sweet and steady and loyal and en
during nature that it will last through
a lifetime, if not asked to lend money."
"Classic," A book which people
praise and don't read."
The man with a new idea is a crank
until the idea succeeds."

One Dose for Coughs
Children cough at night? Give them Ayer's Cherry Pec-
toral. Often a single dose at bedtime will completely
control the cough. Good for any one with a cohl or cough.
Good for easy cases, hard cases; good for acute cases,
chronic cases. Ask your doctor to tell you, honestly and
frankly, just what he thinks of this old standard remedy.
No alcohol in this cough medicine. jrcAyerCo.,Lowell,Mass.

Miner Receives
a Slight Injury
Arthur Jones was stuck on the head
with a small rock while working in the
Zcila mine yesterday morning. The
injury was a superficial scalp would,
which did not interfere with his em
ployment. He consulted Dr. Endicott,
so as to prevent possible complications
arising from the presence of foreign
matter in the wound. After examina
tion and dressing, he was told that there
was no liklehood of danger from this
source.

HOLD MEETING
Continued from PaSe 1
wise for the whole committee to recom
mend any one for appointment;
it was for them, if any action were to
be taken, to simply indorse the choice
of the people of that district.
Clarence Brashw, the committceman
for the district concerned thereupon,
moved that the candidates for appoint
ment be advised to circulate petitions in
their respective interests for republican
signatures in township 3; it being
understood that the candidate receiving
the strongest indorsement in the shape
of signatures would receive the com
mittee's indorsement also. This plan
was satisfactory to all present.
Other matters relating to the ap
proaching campaign were also talked of,
incidentally.
The committee then adjourned to meet
rext Sunday, at which meeting a full
attendance of the committee is re
quested.
It is expected that the petitions from
the citizens of township three will then
be presented in behalf of the several
claimants for the vacancy. Also efforts
will be made looking to securing de
sirable candidates for various county
and township offices, for which aspir
ants are apparently slow in announcing
themsevles;.
VISITS JACKSON
GETS SURPRISE
Continued from Page 1
and once inside everything was so up
to-date that I could have broke my
pocket book without a sigh. I really
wanted to buy a dainty blue silk cap,
that 1 saw on display. It was just a
trifle too elaborate for me, but Mrs
McGary, the lady whom I trust you will
try to meet some day, soon fixed it ex
actly as I wanted it, and Alary, they
have a plan under way here to induce
new customers to come in, that surely
ought to make many friends. The plsn
is to gite a set of dishes away free
every Saturday afternoon at 3 o'clock.
You only purchase 81.00 worth of goods,
and they give you a card with a certain
time of the day stamped on it, and if
the clock stops nearest the time stamped
on your ticket you get the whole set of
dishes entirely free. They don't raise
prices on certain goods as some people
might think, they value a good customer
too much to cheat him, to pay another,
this plan simply means they are sacri
ficing a certain amount of their profits
to make friends.
AT BIERCE'S KOMFOKT STORE.
Well 1 wandered into a shoe store
next, and mabye it wasn't a cosy little
room, and well stocked. Mr. Biercc is
the manager, and is doing all he can in
his business to boost the city. He
carries an elegant line of shoes and
my new 54.00 pair are certainly easy
on mv feet. 1 expect to use them for
the next dance. 1 feel so graceful in
them. You know what the Regal shoe
is back east, well this store carries ull
sizes and at standard prices, so you cm
believe me when 1 say I'll never s?nd
below for any more shoes.
MYKR'S GENTS' FURNISHINGS.
Jack stopped old Bell in front a gent's
furnishing house managed by a man
named Myers, and said he would go In
just for a minute to price a pair of
trousers. Veil Alary, what Jack didn't
buy, a man don't need. He got the
trousers, a new suit of clothes and the
most beautiful shirts lie ever owned.
Truly, he couldn't Finish bragging about
his bargains, and his suit is strictly the
latest thing in tut and Hush. Socks and
handkerchiefs and what not, 1 all for
get. I wonder that more people don't
try and follow Myer's footsteps, his,
business certainly must boom if he
treats all as Jack suys he was treated.
You know Mary, that helps Jackson
wonderfully, and it won't be long before
the people know there i? a Meyer's
store in Jackson, and Amador county in
California.
VELA AND PICCARDO.
jack iust felt like cutting louse and
spending us much money as he could,
and he halted the old horse in front a
sporting goods house- and went in to
examine a rifle. Well he bought a
magnificent gun, 1 tiled it several times
myself.and Jack is so jealous and peev
ish about it, that he dont't want anyone
to even look at it. And you have often
heard of those keen kutter knives, well
Jack bought one for each of his small
cousins,- and is going to mail 2 or 3 for
presents, you know how much a child
loves a knife, and Jack says he re
members how he felt over the first pre
sent of a knife which he received, these
knives remember are strictly hig"n grade,
and were awarded gold medals at the
world's fair, and with all that ccdigiee
to them you can buy them as low as 25
cents. Now you know that is as cheap
as any city store can sell them, and
maybe you can't buy them for less than
35 cents in the city, as they carry
cheaper grade, which they advertise for
a quarter of a dollar.
PETER PICCARUO HARNESS SHOP
Poor old Bell, she didn't have a new
harness for years, and the last one
bought for her never tit and cost S3U.
You remember we shipped air the way
to Kansas City for it. Well right
across from the Jackson post oltice is a
harness shop that certainly ought to
carry a big trade. Why think of it, a
$15 harness, honestly that is all we
paid 815, and then a fat fellow that runs
the place just laughed all over when he
saw how astonished we were at this
cheap harness, and he said, I'll tell you
what I'll do, you try that harness, and
if yor don't like it bring it back and
I'll make it good any wav you want me
to. jack told him that was fair enough,
and after a bit of fixing, the harness fit
like one made for old Bell, who locks
funny to everyone but ourselves, on ac
count of her high hips. Why Piccardo
told Jack that he sold one harness each
day, the week previous, 6 harnesses in
6 days, and 1 think that means that
Jackson is going some at that rate. Of
course the man has a heavy expense, as
his store room is heavily stocked Vith
everything a man could wr.nt to furnish
any team with, and he uses the best of
material in his harness. You bet old
Bell feels good herself
VISITS JACKSON FURNITURE CO.
You remember that old kitchen cabi
net that you shipped from .that Chicago
catalogue, you remember how long it
took you to get it up there, and then you
had to ship it back because it was all
smashed, well the Business Directory in
the Ledger carries an ad for the Jackson
furniture company, and thought 1 might
as well pay that store a visit while in
town, and see how near they came to
city prices. Well Mary, believe me i
not, I could buy that same kitchen cabi
net here for 34.00 less than you paid for
it in Chicago. Now this does not seem
possible, but come here yourself and
find out. I had 2 rooms that needed
furnishing badly because I was always
crowded when 1 had company, so I just
ma^e up my mind I would furnish
them, and 1 did. Rugs, furniture pic
tures and all, and 1 could not be better
pleased for goods nor prices, no matter
where 1 bought it. You know Mary Mr
White the propneror has been working
around furniture for nearly 40 years,
and won't buy anything but what is
strictly first grade, this beats mail crder
houses a mile.
LANGHORST JEWELRY STORE.
I wandered into a jewelry store to
look for a clock that would please mv
ear and iust as 1 opened the door the
different clocks started to strike :hj
eleventh hour. I could hardly believe it
whs so late, but my, the music those
clocks mode, I'll never, forget after
telling their time in the most sweet
and soft tones, the sharp hoarse stroke,
the busy clocks went on tick locking
while 1 made a purchase of one of the
time pieces which I fell in deep love
with, because of the rich mellow tons it
had.
Sending best regards to all the folks,
1 am your loving Cousin.

Last Sunday a party consisting of

Prosser, Miss W. E. McCaskey and
Miss Julia Badaracco, drove to Clinton
for a day's outing. Miss tocCaskcy,
who is census enumerator for township

the information that could be gotten
from the foreign element iv that section
for the census bureau.
Miss McCaskey expects to finish her
work this week and says she had no
trouble whatever in securing what in
formation she asked for.
Miss McCaskey, census enumerator
for township one for all the territory
lying outside of the limits of the city of
Jackson, was allowed ten days furtner
time, in whicn to complete her census
work. Owing to the fact that she was
teaching school in Aetna district during
the time originally allowed for census
work and had to do the work outside of
school hours, it was next to impossible
to get through on schedule time.
School in that district closed last veek,
and by de/oting her entire time to cen
sus work, she will be able to complete
her task in as thorough a manner as
cossible. Everything indicates that in
this township the census will be re
ported fully with few omissions.

Saved from the Grave
"I had about given up hope, after
nearly four years of suffering from a
severe lung trouble," writes Airs M. L.
Uix, of Clarksville, Term. "Often the
pain in my chest would be almost un
bearable and 1 could not do my work,
but Dr. King's New Discovery has
made me feel like a new person. Its
the best medicine made for the throat
and 'ungs. " Obstinate coughs, stubborn
colds, hay fever, la grippe asthma,
croup, bronchitis and hemorrhages,
hoarseness and whooping cough, yield
quickly to this wonderful medicine.
Try it. 50c and 8100. Trial bottle free.

Deafness Can not be Cured
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear
There is only one way to cure deafness
and that Is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucoua lining of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can be
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
aro caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces. .
We will give One Hundred Dollars
or any case of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free.

Stiffened Bodies Found
By Rescuing Party
Seward, Alaska. — Details of the loss
of the codfishing schooner Stanley at
Sanak Island have been brought to
Steward by the mail steamer Dora.
When a rescue party reached the
wreck the bodies of Captain Koshler
and mates Bauers and William were
found frozen stiff in the rigging. The
cook was swept overboard and drowned.
Five who survived— Seamen Hart,
Legeer, Bjornsen, Kandi and Roberts —
jumped overboard the day after the
schooner went on the reef and were
picked up by dories that put out from
the shore.
The rescuer made valiant attertiDt-s to
save the lives of the three men who
were lashed to the rigging, but they
were unsuccessful. Captain Koshler
died just before the rescuers reached
him.
The bodies were buried on Sanak Is
land and the survivors were taken to
Unga.
The vessel and its cargo were des
troyed, the loss being $30,000. In ad
dition, the loss of tbe season's busi
ness will be heavy at several stations,
which will be unable to operate owing
to the loss of supplies aboard the
schooner.

Great men have had . wondrou9 nnd
lengthy careers,
Have thrilled us by actions sublime.
Have written their deeds on tho page of
the years
And carved on tablets of time
The record of striving and struggling
and stress,
Of driving ahead till they drop-
But this is the sum of the great and the
less:
There's always a tombstone on top.
Through ages the sages have, delved into
lore
And sought for the secrets of life.
Have traveled the paths that were trav
eled before,
Have pondered on peace and on strife,
Yet after we study the work that they
did,
Their musings and dreamings we lop,
Until at the last this one truth we find
hid:
There's always a tombstone on top.
Humanity struggles for wealth and for
place,
It labors for silver and gold
And when it has come to the end of the
race
Must leave all it has in its hold.
The ship may sail on and the wheels
still may turn,
The throngs seek the store nnd the
shop,
But this is the lesson that all of us
learn !
There's always a tombstone on top.
Pair ladies have led in the ball and the
court,
The belles and the beaus had their day ;
They smiled on through good and
■through evil report,
Content with their pomp and their
sway.
But where are they now? This we learn
from the belle
And the roysiering blade and the fop :
The whole of life's story these few
words will tell —
There's always a tombstone on top.
'Tis limned in the glittering bauble of
fame,
'Tis breathed in the sight of defeat,
'Tis clicked in the dice that are thrown
in the game,
'Tis seen in fair play or deceit;
The rush and^the struggle, the deed and
the dream,
Must all at one tense moment stop.
No matter what else in this world there
may seem,
There's always a tombstone on top.

gave entire satisfaction in my case and
consequently I do not hesitate to endorse
them. Nine yenrs ago 1 began to suffer
from pains throughout my body. My
kidneys were disordered, the secretions
being' distressing iv passaee and my
back was so lame und painful that I
coulJ not get up from a chair without
using mv hands as a support. When
suffering in that way, 1 began taking
Doan's Kidney Pills and they went
directly to the root of my trouble, re
storing me to good health. I wus ex
amined by a physician not long ago and
was told that there was no symptom of
fault with my kidneys. Doan's, Kidney

Scientist Tries to
Prove Darwin's Theory
Philadelphia.— Dr. Edward Tyson
Relchcrt, investigator and professor of
phychology at the University of Penn
sylvania has published his observations
made in a series of experiments with
blood crystals of animals and men, and
has, he believes, a strong argument in
favor of the Darwin theory of evolution.
His conclusions are based on a study
of 2POO photomicrographic negatives.
These negatives were obtained from the
blood of virtually every species of ani
mal.
Evolution observed from chemical
standpoint is so vast in its possibilities
that it will require the combined efforts
of a hundred investigators working in
cessantly for several generations to com
plete the task, according to Dr. i»'ci
chert.
Not only will the experiments have an
important bearing on the evolutionary
theory, but the ability to distinguish by
comparison of crystals between the
different types of man will be of Im
mense importance in the examination of
blood in murder trials. By Dr. Rei
chert's method it is possible to estab
lish definitely whether the blood is of
man or animal, and to say with a de
gree of positiveness whether it is the
blood of a negro or a white person.

Counterfeit Coins
In Circulation.
Los Angeles— Counterfeit silver money
believed to amount to thousands of
dollars is in circulation here. Hair and
quarter dollars by the hundreds have
been turned in by conductors on all the
trolley lines, and the otticcrs have ob
served that whenever the fare collectors
took in the spurious coin in any parti
cular section of the city, storekeepers
there have also been victimized, in
dicating systematic operations by ex
perts. When the town had been literal
ly flooded with the worthless money,
the smaller daces were worked, and the
interban trainmen began taking in the
imitations, which are the best ever seen
here.
Bulletins of. warning have been issued
by the railway officials, detectives
placed oi' cars and the secret service
operatives notified in vain. The bogus
stream continues flowing in, The
police believe they have traced the
crooks to the Emeryville race track,
where similar coins have been foisted
on patrons of the racing game. The
counterfeiters are supposed to have had
quarters there".
