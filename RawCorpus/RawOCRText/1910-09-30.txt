Sutter Creek Among
Progressive Ranks
County superintendent of schools,
W. fi. Greenhalgh. and F. A. ■Rail,
principal of the Sutter Creek grammar
school, met with the Woman's im
provement club high school committee,
at the residence of ■ Mrs Bayliss C.
Clark on Monday evening last, and
discussed the ways and means of con
ducting the coming compaign /or the
high school.
A mass meeting has also been
called, and will be held in Sutter
Creek on tha 13th of October. Many
prominent speakers will be called on
to address the meeting irom various
towns throughout the county. And
leading educators from different parts
of the state will be on hand to urge
the proposition.
After the mass meeting, a grand
ball will be held for the purpose of
raising funds to defray the expense
necessarily incurred by the campaign.
Many interesting ideas were ad
vanced on the kind of a high school
best suited for the practical education
of the children of this county.
A polytecnic high school seemed to
be the most favored by the committee
considering the matter, including a
business course for the students. This
important question is to be decided by
the trustees of the coming high school.

THE DELECTABLE
LICENSE BUSINESS
The mix-up of remission of libility
for back licenses of John Katto ad W.
11. Glenn, and granting , of! free
licenses to them for future protletion
against any demand on the part o\ the
license collector, has made little ead
way toward unravelment during the
week. The grant of freedom ia at
tempted to be bolstered up by this
clause in the license ordinance! as
passed by the board of supervisors!
Sec. 16. The board of supervisor of
the county of Amador shall have the
power to order a free license issue! to
any person who may apply therenr,
whenever in their judgment the saie
may be necessary to enable any ip
plicant who may be poor and unablefto
pay his license, to earn a livelihod.
What this joker was injected into ne
revenue ordinance for we know nt.
It is about on a par with lawmakers if
the state injecting into a penal statue
a provision to the effect that 'tie
legislators reserved the right to male
a certain criminal offense not a crine
whenever in their judgment  tfe
offender was entitled to such mercif 1
intervention. If boards of supervisop
are granted power to monkey with . o|
finances of their own making, so as j>
build up a system of favoritism, it il
about time the people of Amador werl
made acquainted with the fact. . W
do not believe the clause imparts t
the board any authority of the kinc
nor is any instruction based on sue
clause of any . binding force upo
officers charged with the enforcemen
of revenue laws. Supervisors are em
powered to pass ordinances hot in con
flict "with state laws, and they cai
amend or repeal them, but with thes
acts their authority in the matter i
exhausted. They cannot say to thj
collector, "Collect the license tax in
this case, and don't collect in thai
case," according to their whims and
personal feelings, whether backed
with an application from the in
dividual to be favored or not. id
Sutter Creek at the present time the
anomaly is presented of one showman
claiming exemption from license by
the grace, of the supervisors, S and an
other showman" in *' the same business
being made to pay $10 per week fox
the privilege of running his show.
It is vital to the welfare of Amador
county to find out definitely whether
such proceeding will stand the test of
the courts. In this spirit the editor of
the Ledgtr waited upon the district
attorney last Wednesday and inquired.
if he had looked up the law on the
subject, and what action could be
taken to recover the back licenses
from Ratto, estimated at §500, and al
so to compel him to pay the prescribed
license in the future. He said he was
prepared to make a criminal com
plaint, or start civil suit to determine
the issues involved. The legal adviser
waxed angry, and declined to take any
action whatever. He claimed that no
individual taxpayer but only the board
of supervisors, could require him to
act in such proceedings.
So that the remedy for the injustice
herein stated must be sought else
where. We may say that the matter
is by no means settled by this rebuff.
It is simply clearing the way for other
action. To grant a free license to the
other showman will not meet the is
sue. He is oppressed not by paying
his license tax, but by the favoritism
shown the other by not demanding
payment'from him. We want to khuW
whether we have got a county worth
living in from a governmental point of
view. And we are going to find it out
if possible. •
Farewell Party
A pleasant farewell surprise party
was tendered Misses Helen and
Winnifred Nicholas, daughters or the
Rev. and Mrs Thos. H. Nicholas of the
Jackson Methodist Episcopal church,

JOHNSON GETS
FINE WELCOME
Brilliant Orator Holds
Hearers Spellbound
With Speech
(By\V. S. Thoma»)
Jackson was unusually active on
Tuesday morning last, as a result of
the announcement that the republican
candidate for governor was to visit
Amador's county seat, and deliver an
address. Dr. Schacht and Ed. Kay,
two hardworking, as well as loyal re
publicans, were busily engaged early
in the day, making final arrangements
for the proper reception of so distin
guished a visitor.
A large American flag was draped
beneath the National hotel balcony,
forming a beautiful background, and
large portraits of president Taft and
vice president Sherman were attached
to the flag. The porch in front of the
hotel was used as the rostrum from
which the brilliant orator delivered an
address fired with such patriotism and
sound doctrines as will forever live in
the memory of those who heard him.
On the pillars of the porch were
tacked portraits of the next governor,
the balcony pillars and front of the
building were profusely decorated with
small American flaps.
The Volcano stage brought a full
load of passengers, representing all
the leading politicians from the upper
part of the county, democratic as well
as republicans, and the Plymoutn and
other stages all carried crowds, who
were bent on hearing the peerless or
ator delare his policies.
Other teams from all over the
county came into the town throughout
the morning completely crowding all
the local liveries.
Benches had also been supplied and
were placed in the street facing the
hotel, all of which were crowded with
men, women and children of every
poetical faith.. The large automobiles
bearing the party had a delightful ride
in tie trip from Plymouth to Jackson.
Plynouth was reached on scheduled
time at 10 a. m., and after a short ad
dres the cars rolled on towards Jack
sno, stopping at Drytown, Amador,
Sutter Creek, enroute, and speaking at
each place.
Atlhalf past twelve, the party con
sisting of three automobiles were
brought ■to a halt at Main street
bridgft in north Jackson, by Dr. A. M.
Gall, chairman of the Amador county
central committee, and Dr. Schacht,
who welcomed the party to our city.
Jackson Military band had also as
sembled there, fully uniformed and at
a given signal. The band struck up
"Rally Round the Flag," and
"Marching through Georgia," and the
march down Main street was made.
The band halted in front of the
National hotel, and continued their
music, while the party disembarked
from the cars.
The entire party took dinner at the
National hotel, a special dinner being
served for the guests. The table was
also beautifully decorated for the oc
casion with flowers.
The first automobile carried Hiram
Johnson, the candidate, and his son,
Hiram junior, who is familiarly known
as Jack, and who pilots the car, John
■F. Neylan, press representative of
the San Francisco Bulletin, and W.
Rassell Cole, representing the San
Francisco Call, C. H. McKenney of
Sutter Creek, and J. W. Caldwell of
Jackson. The second automobile
carried Edgar Deacon, Leon Stinson
John Davis, Webb Smith and Fred
Werner, and the third auto carried
Alex Gordon, candidate for railroad
commissioner from this district, Paul
Herriott, press representative of the
San Francisco Examiner, followed, the
party in a team.
Attorney Wm. Snyder opened the
meeting promptly at 1 :30 o'clock, and
presented the Hon. Fred V. Wood as
president of the meeting, and the fol
lowing vice presidents all of whom
were present, and seated on the porch
from which the address was delivered :

THE SHERIFF'S
BIG SALARY LIST
Few in Amador county have any idea
of the amount of money that has been
drawn by U. S. Grexory, tne present
incumbent of the sheriff's oflice and
candidate for reelection, from the
county treasury and other sources on
account of the emoluments of office.
It is natural for a man to want to hold
on to a fat job as long as he can, and
no official can be censured for receiving
all that is coming to him under the
law. If he is paid too liberally for his
services, that is somebody else's look
out more than his. At the same time,
a monopoly of a good thing in the way
of office-holding should not be en
couraged.
U. S. Gregory was elected sheriff
for the first time in 1892, and took his
office in January, 1893. He has been a
candidate for re-election on the demo
cratic ticket at every election since,
and has held the office continuously
ever since, with the exception of one
term of four years, when defeated at
the polls by T. K. Norman. So with
the end of the present term he has held
this office for fourteen years. A close
examination of the record shows that
during this time he has drawn from
county treasury as follows :
Salary as sheriff, 14 years, at
84250 per year - - 859,500
Salary as tax collector, SSOO yr. 7,000
Commissions, etc., as license
collector - • - - 7,732
Traveling expenses, board of
prisoners, etc. - - 12,391
Total - - • - 586.623
This is a fairly good haul for one
man from Amador taxpayers, but it is
not all of the official emoluments.
The sheriff is paid $5 per day and trav
eling expenses for conveying prisoners
to the state prisons, and compensation
taking insane persons to the asylums.
He also collects fees for serving papers
sent from outside the county, and also
commissions in insolvency and other
matters. We have no means of ascer
taining definitely the amount of income
from these sources, but believe we
shall be within the mark in estimating
it at 81,000 per year, average. This
gives a total,income of 814,000 for the
entire period. Added to the amount
from the . county we have the grand
total of 8100,623, with four months
revenue, outside of salary, vet to be
counted.
Isn't it high time to give another
man a chance judging from this view
point.
Expresses His Opinion
Editor Ledger— Your criticism of
the board of supervisors was certain
ly to the point. Everybody this way
is now saying that the supervisors are
up against it sure this time ; also the
sherilF for his insult to the press re
presentative befoie the board.
Mr Gregory is a servant of the
people, and in no way whatever had
he the right to make the remarks he
did while in the performance of his
duties. It looks like a sure case that
some one has shown and is showing
favortism. Certainly the board of
supervisors may wake up some day in
the near future and find that they
have been asleep ; that its up to them
now to redeem themsevles and the
promise they gave when they ran for
office that would do all in their power
to give the "people a square deal."
I had a very interesting talk with
the manager of Richards electric
theatre, and he said there must be
something wrong somewhere, as after
the decision of the board of supervisors
clearing Mr Ratto from paying licence,
and right after the meeting the
sheriff came to Sutter Creek and col
lected the firßt week $10 and the
second week another $10, This seems
an unjust piece of business. In closing
the manager of Richards theatre said
he has made a protest in paying $10
for a license, because of the fact that
Ratto is coming to Sutter Creek to
start a show in opposition, and if he
can show free and Mr Richards not,
why then Mr Richards will certainly
have to close up shop.
Mr Kichards wants it known that
he is no tax dodger, that he is willing
to pay his share. That since he
started his new place in Sutter Creek,
he has had only four nights which weve
advertised two weeks that gave vaude>
ville performance, that he is willing
to pay the county for that— but $20
license is outrageous under the circum
stances. Mr Richards thinks that
some-one has made a mistake and at
the next meeting of the board matters
pertaining to this question will be
setted satisfactorily to all parties.
Yours for a square deal.

MINE NEWS
ALONG LODE
Interesting Accounts of
Mines Located In
Amador Co.
Kennedy
They are cutting a station at the
3450 level, preliminary to opening up
another working level at this depth.
With the sump the shaft is down 3550
feet perpendicular depth. Last week
a machine drill sharpener was started,
and works to a dot. It is a big job to
keep machine drills in good working
order for 100 stamps, employing 300
men. By the new device— which by
the way is the only one of its kind in
the county— the output is GO drills per
hour. And the machine sharpened
drills have the advantage of being of
uniform size, which is also an im
portant factor in actual working.
Bunker Hill
Grading for' the additonal 20 stamps
is about completed. Material for
machinery and building is being ac
cumulated on the ground, and it is ex
pected that the stamps will be pound
ing away by the first of the year.
The 1950 level is being pushed in as
fast as possible. Some trouble has
been encountered here on account of
the extraordinary increase of water,
which indicates the presence of open
or porous ground.
South Eureka.
This mine is looming up as likely to
take the first position among the
dividend-paying mines of the county.
The clean-up of the past month is re
ported as phenomenally large — in the
neighborhood of $90,01)0 for the 60
stamp mill. Probably an extra effort
was made to secure an exceptionally
good clean-up, on account of the tem
porary suspension of the mill soon to
enable necessary repairs being made
to the shaft, a work that will require
several months to complete. It is the
intention to continue the payment of
dividends at the rate of three cents
per share during the period of the
mill's idleness, and the surplus in the
treasury was augmented by the big
clean-up so that there should be no
stoppage of the monthly distribution
to the stockholders. It is reported
that another streak of high-grade ore
has been discovered, making .the out
look very favorable.
Defender
This mine was started up again the
first of the month on rock from the 100
foot level. Both mine and mill had
been idle for many months. It is
working a small force of men, but is
more than paying expenses. The
shaft is clown 300 feet, and levels
opened at that depth, but the machi
nery at present on the mine is unable
to cope with the water and do the
other work. More powerful machi
nery must be installed. Mr Joyce,
who has charge of the property, and
who is one of the principal stock
holders, is operating on a small
scale, until something definite is de
cided upon. There is said to be a
good ore body at the bottom of
the shaft, and the utmost confidence
is expressed that with adequate
equipment it would prove a good pay
ing mine.
Central Eureka
This property is advancing again to
the dividend paying position. A fine
ore body has been encountered in the
2800 level. The ledge is supposed to
be identical with that worked in the
old Eureka mine in its bonanza days.
It is east of the shaft. Preparations
are being made to put the mill in
readiness for crushing ore. An as
sessment of four cents has been levied
upon the capital stock, which it is
thought will carry the company
through to the paying standard, as
this will realize 16,000. The stock has
stiffened in price; from 80 cents two
weeks ago it has advanced to $1.05,
with little to be had at such figures.
Services Well Attended
St. Augustine's church was crowded
to its capacity on Sunday evening to
hear the rector Thos Shea. This was
an elegant opportunity to hear the
Episcopal minister for the faithful
who attend the Methodist services, as
their pastor, the Rev. Nicholas, is at
Pacific Grove, attending the annual
conference held there.
Both the parishes at Jackson and
Sutter Creek are reported to be in
nourishing conditions, under the head
of the new clergyman.p.Nrßnr.n at Tbi postoitich AT jacksoh a» sboojid-oi-ass mattk?.

THE TAX LEVY
The tax rate of $1.85 on each $100 of taxable property as
against $2 on the $100 for last year seems on its face to be
a substantial reduction of 15c in the burdens of the people.
Taking the special taxes and the increase in the assessment
roll into consideration, the relief becomes more apparent than
real. As a matter of fact just about the same amount of
money will be raised from property taxes this year for carry
ing cm the local government as was raised by the higher rate
of last year. The difference in assessment of the current
year as compared with 1909 will be seen from the following
"figures:
Total assessment of 1909 |||| - ; - - $5,361,119
?i"S~j ■' t *': igio - • - 5,676,605
Increase for current year - - - $315,486
This increase comes largely from the [enhanced value of
mining property, rather than a general advance of all classes
of realty. There is no disputing the fact that the mining in
dustry has improved wonderfully during the past twelve
months, and the increased output and generally bright out
look for the mines warranted the boost in valuation. Now
the amount that should be raised from property taxes for the
'two years may be stated as follows:
1909 '•''-'.■ - - ■ $107»222
1910 - v ■/ - ■ - 104,907
Showing that the sum that will be actually turned into
the treasury this year will be short of last year's revenue to
the tune of $2315. In this article we have taken no notice
of the exemption of property within the corporate limits of
the city of Jackson from the road and bridge fund levies be
cause it is immaterial, inasmuch, as the amount is repre
sented by the city tax levy. Now of this $2315 lopped off,
•over $600 is due to the reduction of 1.1 cents in the state
•levy. The repeal of the bluejay and skunk bounty will come
close toward making up the balance of the apparent saving.
This bounty ordinance has been fought through the columns
•of the Ledger from the outset as impolitic and extravagant.
The action of the board in wiping out this expense, even
.at the eleventh year, is simply an indorsement of the stand
taken by this paper all along — and the only paper adverse
.to this bounty project.
To show tbe levy for the various funds for the two years.,
and the amount of revenue that will be raised for each fund,;
we submit the following table for purpose of comparison:
1909 1910 1909 1910
State - - - - 36.4 35.3 Amount raised 819,514 $20,030
Current expense - - 60.6 54.7 " - 32,487 32,050
Hospital .-- 22.0 22.0 " - 11.794 12,488
Road • - - v 33.0 30.0 " - 17,691 17,029
School - - , - - 33.0 30.0 " - 17,691 17,029
Special bridge - - 15.0 12.0 ;«' - 8,191 6,811
Advertising - - - 01.0 •" - — &Bt\
/Total - - -• «2.00 81.80 j
From this it will be seen that the current expense fund,
with the bonnty law eliminated, suffers no diminution. Thei
school fund is cut down $630. The road fund, which really;
includes the special bridge, is curtailed over $2,000, but is 1
still at the maximum. The hospital £und is increased $700,
and this is inexplicable in view of tbe conditions as we un
derstand them. We will take an eacly opportunity of in
quiring into this matter further. The creation of the adver
tising fund by a levy of one cent is a new departure. With
the expenditure of the fund adequately safeguarded we do not
believe amy serious objection would be made. But it is re
ported that an understanding was reached that the money
so raised was to be 'turned over to the chamber of commeice
that was organized in Jackson some fifteen months ago, and
that seems to have died in the process of birth from sheer in
anition. Au organization in name only, without meetings
or active membership, is not apt to command confidence in
the boosting Hue.
The articles is last week's Ledger on the discrimination
in the county license business were something of an eye
opener to the people. No one is bold enough to uphold the
supervisors in tryiug to give clearance papers on over $500
back licenses, and a free permit for the future to John Ratto
and at the same time instructing the collector to exact pay
ment from another in the same line of business in the .'same
tovvu. The incident serves to show how liberal some can bo
when they themselves don't have to fcot the bills. The notion
of inviting newcomers to cast their lot among us, while at the
same time handicapping a stranger just starting in business
by the discrimination route, is comedy and tragedy combined.
SCIENTIFIC
MISCELLANY
Reported wetkly for the Ledge \
Measuring Bullet Flight— The Gas-
Weighing Balance— Carrying Science
Over the Empire— Sprayed Metal
Films— A Powerful Motor— A Novel
Lightning Arrester— The Work of
Smoke Using— The Century Clock-
Waterproof Concrete.
The speed of rifle bullets can bo de
termined by the improved method of
Crantz with such precision that the
error la estimated not to exceed one
foot per second. A series of electric
sparks at the rate of 5,000 per second
lights up the bullet as it passes a hori
zontally pivoted rotating drum covered
with a photographic film, and the dis
tance apart of the images formed on
the film show the bullet's velocity,
the frequency of the spark and the
rate of the drum's revolution being
known. To make measurements easier,
a glass rule divided into millimeters is
photographed with the bullet at each
spark. The reduction of speed by air
friction] is shown from the lessened
space apart of images of the bullet on
a second drum, and the lag of the
image of the second drum gives the
time of flight between the two.
bpecial arrangement is made for
synchronizing the drums and identify
ing the images on each. A pendulum
contact-breaker closes the electric
circuit that fires the rifle, and cuts off
the current except during the minute
fraction of a second in which the bul
let is passing the drum.
The super-sensitive balance of Sir
William Ramsay nas a short beam and
slender supports of silica and the tray
is supported by a hair of silica. The
instrument is kept in a special metal
lic case in an underground^ chamber.
A tiny mirror reflects a point of light
to a black scale six feet away, and the
slightest deflection of the beam is
made perceptible by movement of the
light along the scale. The release
from a tiny tube on the tray of xenon
gas known to weigh only 1-7,000,000,
000 of an ounce was registered on the
scale. The limit of possible smallness
in metal weights seems to be reached
in Sir William's aluminum strand,
finer than a hair, and 1-25 inch lost;,
weighing 1-1,400,003 «f an ounce. 1
The British Association for the 'Ad
vancement of Science has met tviee
in Canada, and once in South Africa.
Its 1914 meeting is to be held in Aus
tralia.
The new spraying process of deposit
ing metal films, the invention of U.
School) of Zurich, seems to be adapted
to a wider range of applications than
any other method of producing protec
tive coatings. The electrolytic 'pro
cess coats iron and other metals with
a covering of gold, silver, nickel,
copper or zinc, and has come into ex
tensive use for plate goods and for
electrotypes used in printing. Iron is
also protected from the atmosphere t\v
galvanizing, or dipping into molten
zinc, and by tinning in a bath of mol
ten tin. Sherardizing is the improved
process of Cowper-Coles, and gives a
beautifully adherent deposit of zinc on
heating iron articles in contact with
zinc to about 200 deg. C, or more
than 200 deg. below the melting point
of zinc. In the Schoop process, the
metal for deposit is liquefied and
sprayed as a fine mist upon the surface
to be coated. Compressed nitrogen
'Or other inert gas may be used to pro
duce the fine spray, and, while the
molten metal must come from the
nozzles at a temperature of several
hundred degrees, the mist itself is
found to be not hotter than 40 deg.
to 60 deg. C. The projected particles
strike with such force, however, that
they are welded together into a
homogeneous coating. Various metals
may be deposited, and the coolness of
the mist makes it practicable to coat
inflammable substances, such as
paper, wood, cellul&id and wax. The
coating is harder than films produced
by rolling. Among numberless ap
plications suggested .are the coating
of wooden aeroplane propellers and of
balloon envelopes, it being possible
to cover the latter with a gas-tight
aluminum film scarcely more than 1
1000 of an inch thick.
The hugo electric motor made at
Stafford, Eng., weighs nearly 200 long
tons, has a ventilated commutator 25
feet lung and 2 feet in diameter, and
with a direct current of 930 volts will
yield 10,000 horse-power. The voltage
can be raised to 14,000, when 15,000
horse-power will be developed at 90
revolutions per minute. The machine
is designed for a 36-inch cogging and
finishing mill, and for rolling 5,400
pound stud ingots into rails at one
operation.
A carborundum block is tho latest
lightning arrester applied to truin
dispatchinjr circuits. The resistance
is enough to prevent leakaga of tho
ordinary telegraphic current, but the
charges induced by lightning pass
freely to thq ground.

The era of smokeless cities is found
b ! Peter Fyfe, chief sanitary in
sjector of Glasgow, to be almost in
sght. If the smoke came chiefly from
fctory chimneys, as has been sup
psed, remedies are already at hand,
tit experiments last year showed that
fie waste gases from 40 household
equal In cubic feet those of
ti average factory chimney, and to
jrevent this loss some new fireplace or
pme smokeless fuel must be awaited.
The saving of factory smoke is an
iconomical as well as sanitary gain,
jomplaint having been made of Bmoke
from four boilers of the Glasgow Sew
jge Department, well-known smoke
breventing plant was applied to three
jf the boilers in October, 1908, and for
comparison the same kind of fuel
was used in the next seven months as
iad been used in the corresponding
months of 1907 and 1908. The actual
3aving of money for the seven months
was ?1,100. All smoke was pre
sented, all steam required was raised
n three boilers instead of four, and
here was an increase of 240,000.000
gallons in the sewage pumped. The
Smoke-consuming apparatus cost about
$1,000 for each boilers, requiring
practically no repairs. A cheaper
fuel is now used, and this increase is
the saving.
Perhaps as near an approach to per
petual motion as is likely to be made
in any mechanical device is the time
piece of a clockmaker of Buiton-on-
Txent. It was originally claimed that
the clock would go 50 years without
winding or other interference, but it
is now asserted that it can be depended
upon to run without interruption for a
century. An electric current is ob
tained from two wires inserted in the
eartn and connected with the clock.
The little concrete house at the
Brussels Exposition is reported to
have been of especial interest on ac
count of its practical submergence to
test its waterproof qualities. It is on
a hillside, and a large volumne of
water is turned upon its roof and flows
continually down its sides, except at
the entrance. No sigß of leakage is to
be seen. The concrete appears to be
about four inches in thickness, and
was treated with ceresit.
DEEDS. NOT WORDS.
Jackson People Have Absolute
Prool of Deeds at Home
It's not words, but deeds that prove
true merit
The deeds of Doan's Kidney Pills,
For Jackson kidney sufferers,
Have made their local reputation.
Proof lies in the testimony of Jack
son people who have been cured to
stay cured.
Mrs Eliza Hobbs, Newmanville,
Jackson, Cal.. says: "I cheerfully
re-endorse Doan's Kidney Pills and
confirm all I said in their favor over
two and a half years ago, when I public
ly recommended them. My back was
lame and painful and I was obliged to
walk all Htooped over. In the morning
I was stiff and lame and I did not
have a moment's freedom from pain.
My ambition and energy left me, and
I was distressed by headaches and
dizzy spells. One of ray friends had
taken Doan's Kidney I'MJs with satis
factory results and on this person's
advice, I was induced to try the
remedy. I procured my supply from
the City Pharmacy, and by tho time I
had taken the contents of two boxes,
not a symptom of my trouble re
mained. I have been free from kid
ney complaint during the time that
hat; since passed."
For sale by all dealers. Price 50

Rancheria Oance
The old stone building on Rancheria

as the scene of the revels of the

last Saturday night to the notes of
violins, and the feet of festive

The occasion was the celebration of

Stowera.
Meeting some distance away, the as
sembled friends to the merry accom
paniment of old tin cans and kettles,

ASPARAGUS CULTIVATION.
How to Make a Bed of the Edible
Young Shoots.
■ Asparagus is a perennial, herb eultl
vatocl for Its edible young shoots, it Is
a'rujijied plant and will thrive under
adverse conditions, but to obtain the
succulent stalks needed for culinary
purposes \vell drained, rich soil Is ab
solutely necessary. The soil should be
well mixed with rotted manures 'con
taining much uitrogeu and potash.
Prepare the bed by plowing or spad
ing deeply, beginning the work early
and looking after the drnlnnge prob
lem carefully.; Pluuts at least one year
old should be obtained for this bed.
They can be raised from seed, which Is
sown outdoors lv April In drills One
foot apart, the seed being covered
about une-unlf inch. Plants suitable
for transplanting the followlug spring
may be easily Brown thla . way. or
roots may be obtained from one to
three years old. ' '
Set the plants. in the permanent liod.
in furrows eighteen inches apart, the
plants being the same distance apart
in each furrow. I Be careful to spread
the roots out naturally and set each
plant on a little mound of earth In the
furrow. Cover at first to n depth of a
few inches, gradually B|linjt in as the
season advances. 'In the fall cut back
all the stocks to a level with the
ground for the winter.
In the second year loosen the soil by
shallow spadlug. Wheu the tirst shoots
appear the rows may be billed up
somewhat. Cut sparingly until the
third year, as the plants will be more
productive afterward.
1 How to Overcome Oily Hair.
!il 'A ''young woman who has tried all
sorts of remedies to keep the oil out ot
her hair says she gets best results by
Using a shampoo made from pure olive

been mixed. Cut a cake of soap Into a
quart of bolliug water to make tliicU
jelly when cold. This is bottled 11 nd
kept for future use. Before shampoo
ing take a couple of spoonfuls of this
Jelly, mix It with a plncb of soda and
rub it well into the scalp, which nas
uret been wet with hot water. Anoth
er way to apply the shampoo mixture
to the scalp Is to part the hair in
strands and rub it on with a tooth
brush or small nailbrush. After the
scalp and long hnlr have been well
washed they should be rubbed vigor
ously with the linger tips and thor
oughly rinsed.

The Hunting Nuisance
The farmers and stockmen between
Jackson and Lancha Piana are deter
mined to put n stop to hunting on
their lands. Some months ago, when
a number of imported game birds were
turned loose within a few miles of
Jackson, a game reserve was declared,
prohibiting shooting on certain lands
froth Butte mountain to Stony creek.
The effect of this was to throw sports
men in their travels for game to
other ranches outside the prescribed
limits. Below Stony creek and clear
to Lancha Plana, the hunters have
become an intolerable nuisance, not
withstanding the fact that notices have
been posted on most, of the ranches,
forbidding hunting. Horses and cattle
have been shot by intruders. One firm
reports the loss of several hundred
dollars in this way. The menace from
grass tires has also been great. They
have resolved that hunting must be
stopped. An advertisement appears in
this issue, signed by about all the
ranchers and stockmen of the Jackson
valley region, cautioning hunters,
against further trespass, and that tres
passers will be prosecuted to ' utmost
extent of', the law. The landowners
have combined in this movement, and
are determined to make an example of
the first one caught hunting on their
premises. This action wipes off the
map of the happy- hunting grounds all
the lands southwest of Jackson clear
to the Mokelumne river, a distance
of nine or ten miles.

Find Aged Man Dead
Yesterday morning, when Daniel
Massa went to inquire how Claro Es
conor was getting along, he found the
old man dead in his cabin. Esconor
was a native of Mexico, but has fol
lowed mining in this county for many
years. He has been confined to the
county home on several occasions,
but each time insisted on going back
to his old cabin, which lies, along the
creek, just beyond Jackson Gate.
He always expressed the desire of
spending his last days in his cabin,
and his wish was gratified. However,
his death was of a most pitiable
nature, as the coroner's jury all
agreed that the oI H Mexican virtually
starved to death.
The board of supervisors had fixed a
monthly allowance for him, and he
was allowed to make his purchases at
Chichizola store. But old age and ex
treme weakness prevented him from
preparing what little food he had on
hand, and as a result he expired some
time between Wednesday and Thurs
day.
Coroner Potter was notified of the
man's death, and on Thursday evening
empaneled a jury composed of Jas J.
Wright, foreman, 'J. S. Garbarini,
Jo's. Datson, J. V. Belluomini, Row
land White, A. L. Meek, E. E. Huey,
R. O. Ball. Frank Simcich, C. Mur
ton, Q. O- Wrigglesworth.
After hearing the testimony of
several witnesses including a relative
named Frank Questo, a verdict was
rendered to the effect : ' 'We find that
Claro Esconor, nged 84 years, came to
his death by reason of old age, and
extreme weaknpss, and consequent in
ability to prepare his food and care
for himself. The remains were taken
by undertaker Huberty and prepared
for burial, the funeral being held on
Friday morning, interment in the
Catholic cemetery.

Gravel Aline Bonded
W. H. Greenhalgh has secured an
option of purchase on the Hadley
gravel mine, owned by Messrs. Geo.
Hadley, W. Dent and J. Vose. It is
situated several miles east of Oleta,
and consists of 80 acres of placer held
under location title. . It is the inten
tion to organize a company to operate
the claim. A party of four from
Jackson, namely, W. H. Greenhalgh.
E. V. Zumbiel, K. I. Kerr, and R.
Webb, also two from Sutter Creek-
Edward Allen and H. Deacon, visited
the property last Sunday. It is a drift
proposition, and a tunnel has been
driven several hundred feet into the
lava capped gravel, the worK thus
done indicating that an extensive and
rich gravel channel exists there. The
gravel is of free character, and
yields up its precious contents by
the simple washing process. Some
1400 or 1500 car loads of pay gravel
is on the dump ready for washing.
Samples from different points in ths
breast of the several prospect drifts
were taken out and washed while the
■visitors were there, and gold to the
value of over $3 was obtained, repre
senting the output of ten pans of
dirt. This result is considered some
thing extraordinary. Prospecting
operations will be prosecuted on a
more definite method during the next
three weeks, and upon the outcome
will depend whether the deal will be
consummated. It is practically a new
gravel claim, being the first instance
ot the lava capped gold bearing chan
nel being penetrated in this vicinity.
Chamberlain's colic, cholera and
diarrhoea remedy is today the best

equally valuable for children and

Another Card
The political card of A. Caminetti
appears in the proper column. He is
running on the democratic ticket for
re election as state senator. We hope
he will not be elected, although we
must admit he is a rustler in politics.
As far back as 1877—33 year3— we can
lemember him as running tor office,
and he has been a standing candidate
ever since, and it must be confessed he
has generally ' 'got there. ' ' Caminetti
should be wary of running once too
often.

POLITICAL COMMENT
John Merchant
Republican candidata for assessor,
needs no introduction to the people of
this county. He is well known to all
voters. He has served the people as a
supervisor and also as assessor, and
hia official record in every public posi
tion he has filled is one of fairfulnesH
to the public interest? and fairness to
all. The Ledger has nothing to say
against the present incumbent of the
assessor's office. We cannot concede
that the welfare of the county woufd
not be equally as well protected by the
election of John Marchant as it has
been during the last four years. The
office requires a sound judgment in the
valuation of property, a disposition to
deal fairly and impartially with all
interests, and a willingness to listen
to the fact 3 before deciding upon the
assessable value of property. We
have no faith in that policy that de
cides beforehand that property values
should be increased all around, no as
to secure a proportional lower tax
rate. Disappointment has invariably
followed whenever the assessment
figures have been arbitrarily raised
in that spirit, without a correspond
ing increase in actual values. The
people have been called upon to pay
more in actual cash than before when
ever that policy has been tried. Any
arbitrary jump in values should he dis
couraged as inimical and oppressive to
all taxpayers.
In John Marchant everybody will
get a square deal, after a careful and
attentive examination of the facts.
H E Potter
Is the republican candidate for
coroner and public administrator, and
present incumbent of that office. As
an official it cannot be disputed that
he has attended faithfully to the
duties of his position, devoting his
time and energies thereto to an ex
tent that deserves indorsement at the
hands of the voters. Ho has been in
office one term, and it is due to him,
in recognition of his services, to re
elect him. As an example of the
scuruplousness with which he has met
every call of duly, we may cite the
Fremont mine disaster. The remains
of the unfortunate victims were col
lected with care, and buried in neatly
arranged graves in the Plymouth
cemetery, and the mounds marked aa
far as it was possible to identify the
victims. He did not stop here, and
was not content until by general sub
scription he raised sufficient money to
secure an appropriate monument, in
scribed with the names of those who
perished in that mine horror— the
greatest disaster that has marked the
history of Amador \ county. This
monument was dedicated only a few
weeks ago. Mr Potter has earned,
and we may add has received— the
gratitude of all surviving relatives of
that calamity, and of the public
generally, for his noble actions in this
matter. That he will be reelected to
the position is a foregone conclusion.
Will Work Claim
Wm. Ross, a mining man. was in
Jackson in the early part of the week,
having business with the recorder's
office. He has invested in gravel
claims in Oleta district. He has
secured over 300 acres of the Houdy
ranches, for mining purposes. It is
believed that a gold bearing deposit
runs through this land under the lava
cap. He has secured a ditch and
water right, and intends to carry
water to the claims and operate the
coming season. Mr Ross has great
faith in the gravel mining possibilities
around Oleta. 'He has spent consider
able time in a thorough investigation.
Goes to Marysville
A telegram was received from Rev.
Thos. H. Nicholas, who closed his
pastorate with the Methodist church a
week ago, and who is at present at
tending the Methoidst conference,
which is in session at Pacific Grove,
announcing that he has been assigned
to a charge in Marysville, Üba county,
to which place he will move his family
immediately.
Word was also received that Rev. J.
C. Duncan, formerly of Melrose,
California, has been assigned to' the
local parish, and will take charge on
Sunday next. The many friends of
Rev. Nicholas will be pleased to learn
of his new appointment to Marysville,
which city will be able to provide him
with the necessary high school advan
tages which the clergyman so desired
for his children.

Died at Hospital
• Domenico Gazzera underwent a
major operation at the county hospital
on Monday morning last, and on Tues
day evening at 8 o'clock the patient
Gazzara had been feeble minded for
the past, several yenrs, and was com
mitted to the care of his mother, who
resides on n <rth Main street.
Of late he complained of Buffering
considerable pain, and as a result the
operation was decided upon. He was
removed to the hospital where Dr.
Endicott assisted by Dr. Gall per
formed the operation. The abdomen
was opened und much foreign matter
removed, the appendix was also re
moved, other of the internal organs
were found to be badly affected, and
were given treatment. The victim,
however, was too far beyond med'cal
assistance to recover, and died without
recovering from tho ordeal of the
operation.
Gazzara was laid to his final rest
from his late residence on Stacel Aye.,
on Friday morning. Mass was con
ducted by Rev. Father Laffan of St.
Patrick's church, interment in the
Catholic cemetery.
Don't Break Down.
Severe strains on the vital organs,
like strains on machinery, cause
break-downs. You can't overtax
stomach, liver, kidneys, bowels or
nerves without serious danger to your
self. If you are weak or run down, or
under strain of any kind, take Electric
Bitters the matchless, tonic medicine.
Mr 3J. EJ. Van de Sande, of Kirkland,
111., writes: "That I did not break
down, while enduring a most severe
strain, for three months, is due wholly
to Electric Bitters. " Use them and
enjoy health and strength. Satisfac
tion positively guaranteed. 50 cents

Returns from Hospital
Steve Matich, who has been to the
city since June 7th, receiving treat
ment for an affected ear, returned to
Jackson on Sunday evening greatly
improved. Matich, who is a miner,
suffered a severe attack of la grippe
last spring, and the doctors who at
tended him claim this trouble was
the result of his previous sickness.
Matich is a first cousin to Michael
Rugne of tliis city.
Killed by the Cars.
Francis Si bole, son of Martin Sibole
of lone, was instantly killed on Thurs
day of last week near Merced, by be
ing run over by a train. How the
fatal mishap occurred is not clear. As
far as we can learn the deceased, who
was a young man of exemplary charac
ter, was employed by the railroad
company. He wa3 lying in the track
with a train approaching. Whether he
fell on the track through a dizzy spell,
or fell accidentally and stunned is not
known. As the trap- approached, he
endeavored to get out of the way, but
was too late, and was run over and
killed. His father went to Merced
Friday last, and brought the remains
to lone, and the funeral took place in
that town on Sunday last, under the
auspices of the local parlor of Native
Sons, of which order deceased was a
member.
Cache of Rich
Rock Discovered-
Recently some children living close
to Sutter Creek happened in their
playful mood to roll over a large
boulder, and uncovered a quantity ofi
quartz rock that had evidently beerc
secreted there from some motive not)
commendable. The children took thq)
rock or portions of it home, and upor?
examination by parties posted upon
gold bearing ores it was pronounced
bonanza rock, carrying very high
values. The parents repaired to the
spot where it was found, and upon
further searching they stumbled across
a lot more of the same stuff. Alto
gether the find yielded about $400 in
gold. It had evidently been hid away
by high graders working in the mines,
and for some unknown reason the
parties were unable to convert it into
coin. It is supposed that the ore came
from the Central Eureka mine, when
that property was in its bonanza days
some years ago.

FROM OUR
EXCHANGES
John Sauve and Frank Bernardi of
Mokelumne Hill gave a demonstration
here to-day, Friday, of their new
safety fuss or spitter. We have tmly
space for a brief account of this in
vention, which i 3 likely to be widely
adopted and be the means of greatly
reducing the accident li3t in* mines.
In bnsf the invention does awr.y with
tha " Inst man in the shnit," to spit
the fusa and taks chances of getting
hoisted out before tho explosion. The
invention consists of a small device
Which is attached "to tho fuss just
above the cap and which does the spit
ting, the length of fuse between the
cap and the device regulates the time
of firing. The device is connected by
small wires that lead to an electric
battery, that may be located on the
surface or in a .level, where the
operator can in perfect safety, with
a single touch spit all the fuses, the
charges exploding as in any case,
according to the length of the fuse.
This little device about an inch and a
half in length, and but little larger
than the inclosed fuse to which it lit*,
will work under water with equal
facility as in dry rock. The interval
between tie shots, can be easily regu
lated so that counting is possible or
they can all be made to go at once.
The main feature is that all tho fuses
can be spitted at once by the operator,
who, may be any distance *way in a
position of perfect safety,— Prospect
C. W. Brown, a ditch-tender for the
Mokelumne River Power and Water
Company, has quite a record as a
rattlesnake exterminator. During
the past summer he 'has secured the
scalps and rattles of fourteen of the
reptiles. Recently >in hunting for a
bee- tree he felt something strike his
leg, and upon investigation found a
rattler banging <to his pants by one
fang. During a forest fire recently
he found a couple of rattlesnakes en
twined about each other in mortal
combat, and he got them both with
one stroke of his hoe. Last winter
while burning brush, he found an en
tire colony of snakes in a log, having
entered through a knothole. - Citizen.
A young man, Geo McAulitfe, who
burglarized Wlliam's drug store a
couple of weeks ago, was brought
down from Jackson by sheriff Gregory
last Saturday and had his preliminary
examination before justice Gartin
He was held to the superior court for
trial on the charge with bail fixed at
$1000, which he was unable to fur
nish, and he was remanded to the
custody of sheriff Gregory.— Echo.
Kitchen Shower
The local lodge of Rebekahs' ten
dered Mrs Stanley James a surprise
party on Friday evening, in the shupe
of a kitchen shower.
Seventeen members uere in the
party, and every imaginable kind of
kitchen utensils were presented to J the

bride.
Refreshments were served. and
music rendered, and the party voted

Raker's Eligibility.
The following constitutional pro
vision makes it doubtful whether
ud»e Raker, the democratic nominee
for congressman in this district, is
eligible for that position. Ho holds
the position for supsrior judfle of
Modoe county, and the state constitu
tion says a judge of the superior court
must not be a candidate, for any other
office while holding that position. I .
is up to him to resign tho judgeohip,
or withdraw from the congressional
fight. But he evidently wants to hold
on a judge, so that in the event of his
defeat for congress, he would not ba
shut out entirely from the public crib.
He is parading through the district
making the canvass instead of at
tending to his judicial duties. This
dual office holJing or office seeking
business is anything but commendable.
When electeJ, he by implication
agreed to serve as judge for the full
term. Let judge Raker stay where he
is, at least until the term of his en
gagement has expired. W. F. Engle
bright has served the district well, and
should be relected by a large majority.
Article 5, Section 20— The governor
Shall not, during his term of oth'ce. be
elected a senator to the senate of the
United States.
Article 6, Section 18— The justices of
the supreme court and judges of the
superior court sshall be ineligible to
any other office or public employment,
than a judicial office or employment,
during the term for which they have
been elected. i
Young Wife Dies
Mrs Chester O'Neil, wife of Chester
O'Neil, formerly of Jackson, passed
away at the Sutler Creek sanitarium.
on Saturday at midnight, as the result
of a severe attack of typhoid fever.
The deceased was a bride of six
months, and only 17 years of age.
She was a native of San Andreas,
Calaveras county, where her remains
were taken and interred on Monday
last.
O'Neil and his young wife had taken
up a homestead at Railroad Flat,
several months ago, and were getting
along nicely when sickness overtook
Mrs O'Neil. She was able to be
about, however, and nothing serious
was anticipated, the husband visiting
Jackson and obtaining what necessary
medical attention he thought was pro
per. The condition grew worse, and it
was finally decided to remove her to
the sanitarium. After two days treat
ment with Dr. Goodman, hopes were
entertained for her recovery, but a
relapse occurred, and she died very
suddenly.
Successful Operation
Florence Dufrene, tiie eight year old
daughter of Jack Dufrene, who resides
near the Copper mines, outside of
lone, was hastily brought to Jackson
on Sunday evening, and placed in the
county hospital, where she underwent
an immediate operation for appendici
tis. The little girl suffered intense
pain and the operation was considered
the one thing to save her life.
Dr. Endicott assisted by Dr. Gall
performed the operation, which is re
ported in every way a complete sue
cess. The patient's condition is tine
and her recovery will only be a matter
of time.
Tariff Revision
The sound protectionist is no op
ponent of tariff revision at the proper
time, nnd has always approved such
changes in schedules as conditions
SDom to warrant. But he never has
and he naver will join In the cry for
tariff revision in the interest of for
eign as against home industries, and
that is what very much of the demand
for lower duties means. A case direct
ly in point is furnished by the present
situation in the cotton manufacturing
industry. Owing to the high price of
raw material, due partly to anticipated
shortage injthe cotton crop and largely
ti speculation, mills are operating on
short time or suspending entirely for a
season. There is not a cent of duty
on cotton, and the rates on cotton
goods have been almost unchanged.
How can the responsibility for the
trouble in the cotton-spinning and
cotton-cloth-making industries be laid
to the tariff? Fibre and Fabric sug
gests this question when it says.
We find that the years under the for
mer tariff were the most prosperous in
the history of our country. Labor
was fully employed, and wages ad
vanced ten to twenty per cent. The
present tariff is almost identical, so
far as the wool and cotton schedules
,are concerned, yet the people are being
urged to send men to Washington to
deliberately open the way for foreign
manufacturers to serve America the
came r.s Canada textile mills and
throw tnousands of operatives out of
their chosen occupations permanently.
It is well to have tariff revision
when needed, but a revision that will
put American manufacturers out of
business and American wage-earners
out of work to aid foreigners is not the
kind to commend itself to the thought
ful American citizen.— Troy Times.
Cloudburst at Yosemite
Presumably from a heavy cloudburst
back in the high Sierra September
14, the Yosemite falls, which have
been dry for several weeks, sprung a
sudden and unexpected leak this eve
ning at 6 :45 o'clock when the advance
wall of a raging torrent of water
leaped over the tails landing twenty
six hundred feet below with a rear
that was heard for miles, bringing the
diners at Sentinel hotel, near the foot
of the falls, to their feet in fright.
For two hours the volume of water
pouring over the falls exceeded all
past records, and has now settled back
to the average springtime run. Why
the cause id not known as yet, the
sudden flow is thought to be clue, to a
cloudburst although some advance the
theory that a giant slide back in the
mountains dammed up a canyon and
formed a lake, the waters being forced
over the falls.

Continued from Page 1
semblage, convened to listen to a dis
tinguished California citizen, His stay
in Jackson is necessarily limited, so
without wasting any time in prelimi
naries, I will proceed to introduce to
you the gentleman whom you have nil
come to see and hear ; the man who
for the lost four years' is destined to
be the foremost citizen of this great
empire state of the Pacific coast. It
is with pleasure that 1 now introduce
and present to you the Hon Hiram W.
Johnson, the next governor of Call
forina.
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you
for the kind hospitality shown me this
afternoon, in coming here to listen to
what I have to say about our present
campaign.
You are showing your appreciation
by your presence here on this ' occas
sion, and I wish to tell you I feel
very grateful and from the bottom of
my heart I wish to expres3 to you my
heartiest regards.
I very much regret that I was un
able to hold a night meeting in your
city, and am sorry I could not visit
you before, but pressing exigencies
rendered it utterly impossible. The
state central committee made the
schedule, and I was compelled to ad
here strictly to it.
I began campaigning six months
ago, because of the fact that many of
us thought that there wa3 much im
portant work to be done. We thought
that the direct primary election law
might help the people select f heir own
candidates, and so rid the state of
much corrupt politics.
Last March, setting our teeth to the
task, we began to preach doctrines
and policies that would enable us to
restore to the people their rights, and
'assist this glorious state in which 1
was born, and the party with which I
am affiliated, in accomplishing many
undertakings which are greatly
needed.
We began advocating our policies,
and found that throughout the state
there was a great sympathetic feeling
with us. :'
So great was the faith of our ad
herents, that on the 16th of August,
102,000 votes were piled up for our
cause. I take no part of the credit,
and I trust you will not consider me as
trying to bring to myself one particle
of credit. But that vote,, tremendous
and emphatic as it was, means to you
and me a chance to again come into
the rights of that which belongs to us.
It is now up to the people to say
whether the rapuhhean or democratic
party will rid the state of its bosses
and grafters.
The republican party decreed that
there could be but one main issue, and
that issue I am fighting for today.
. The, sole object, of this campaign
was, and is now, to make clear to
: you, that upon this one great problem
hinges much success for our state, and
the republican party as well..
There will be no hesistation or vas
cillation with the members of our
party in fighting this battle for our
rights, and we are going to struggle
until we have the government of this
state back in full control of the
people, and then we will kick out Wm.
£V Herrin and the Southern Pacific
railroad company. lam telling every
one that we will not hesitate nor com
promise in our duty. We shall not
reach out for unpopular votes, ! nor
swerve in any way from the original
line 3 marked out at the opening of the
campaign.- We will follow our policies
until we are successful, regardless of
any ridicule or scorn that may be
hurled at us. Should Bell be elected,
1 trust he will follow out the policies
he claims to be following.
There is one -subject I wish to
speak about, whicn is causing con
siderable comment in the opposite
ranks. It is thesquars deal proposi
tion. They claim that if they are
successful, the;/ will accord the rail
road companies a square deal on the
one hand and the people a square deal
on the other hand.
Now to be sure, a square deal must
be given to the public at all times.
Why this is our very policy, a:id no
just man could act otherwise than to
grant to all the full benefit of their
rights. You need not waste time or
efforts in arguing the square deal pro
position, for the Southern Facific rail
road company have uhvays taken the
square deal and more too, and various
means are being advised at the present
time to give such people as Jim 'Hill
and other railroad offlcials a square
deal. Ido not hostitate to say it will
be found in nearly every instance,
that the square deal pretense is noth
ing more than a schema framed up to
falce the people and enricn the rail
roads.
The character of this contest is not
planned in such a way that we will be
obliged to go out and tear up railroad
tracks or destroy rolling stock. I
shall not bother any honestly vested
business interests. But we shall say
to the Southern Pacific .railroad com
pany."carry on your business in a legi
timate way, and_ we will not disturb
you," but we will also tell Herrin and
the Southern Pacific, "you must keep
your dirty hands out of politics, or we
will kick you ou£."
My constructive policies as outlined
seem quite obvious and unnecessary for
lengthy discussion.
The important state features of ' my
policies are as follows : I believe in
the election of United States senators
by direct vote of the people. At pre
sent this important part of the govern
ment is ruled by the state legislature.
1 confess it will be nigh impossible for
us to change our constitutional laws,
but, with the direct primary law, we
are going to change the law so aa to
be able to elect our United States
senators by direct vote.
I believe in the Australian ballot
system, I firmly advocate Asiatic ex
clusion, and I shall fight hard for the
direct legislative law. That this state
can be governed properly there is no
question in my mind, and I believe
the people should have some right to
discharge 'all incompetent and corrupt
officials, and fire them out of office.
This is the recall act that receives
so much prominence in our platform.
I shall strive hard to see nn ad
equate employers' liability law. Ger
many and France take care of their
, injured employes,- and several of our
states have already adopted such laws
that will make liable the company for
any risk that the employee might be
subject to, and make the employer
responsible for negligence that might
■ cause injury to any employee.
p Now hs to our conservationism,
Pinchot and Garfield blazed the path
way in which we are traveling. 1
1 absolutely,, maintain that all men
should stand in absolute equality be
, fore the law, and most emphatically
1 endorse a non-partisan judiciary, so
1 that judges shall never be compelled
' to be responsible to any clique or set
of bosses, for favors that may be
needed, or that may be forced upon
them, rendering them unfit to pass
sentence that would otherwise receive
different consideration. County judges
as a rule are not facing this problem,
as seriously as do the judiciary candi
dates in the larger cities.
Many minor things have been ad
opted in our platform, of which you
will be able to learn through the liter
ature now being prepared, and which
will be spread among you shortly.
All good citizens, regardless or party
politics, certainly wish to see some of
mv policies carried out. It goes with
out saying, that the next legislature
of the state of California will surely
be overwhelmingly republican and the
conclusion is immediately reached that
if my reforms are to be carried out,
the party which is dominating must do
it, the party with the greatest strength
surely must be looked to for success
ful reform. Ido not wish to be mis
understood, and have you think that I
imagine alt political virtues lie within
our own party ranks. Oh no. the
democratic party has many virtues
that are illustrous, but the problem
which we are facing is, where can
we best have thess undertakings ac
complished?
1 tell you friends, the aspect of
California republicanism was never
brighter than at the present time.
Never in the history of the state have
we held such a prominent position in
the political field as we now hold. We
are now on the political map of the
nation, our platform was wired all
over the United States, and received
the heartiest approval in every state
in the union. Vve are in the foreground
of the fighting progressive states of
the union, with our demands, which
are : government by the pedple, and
not government to satisfy the interests.
La Folette pioneered the policies in
the Middle West, and today we are
marching side by side with New
York's peerless leader, a man who has
principles and who expressed his poli
cies fearlessly in what is termed in
surgency; a man who made it possible
to make the insurgency fight in this
state a crowning success, a man who
is loved and honored by all, Theodore
Roosevelt. Now whether you call it
insurgency, or whatever other name
you care to invent for it, we are sim
ply demanding the rights for the
people, and I. assure you we will be
successful in our fight. Insurgency
really stands for true and honest pur
poses, and I claim it is our duty to
fight the monopolies as long as they J
attempt to run our government.
The interest of our government must
be considered before any special in
terests, the struggle of the freeman
: must be heard before the clamor of
corporations for power.
I am in this fight to help these little
ones assembled here, by helping to
give them an equal footing, an equal
opportunity with that of the rich man,
in preparing for them a future such as
they will be compelled to face. This
is our aim and for tnis purpose I am
struggling now.
■ We appeal to you in this fight, . that
all who desire to see a reform move

At the conclusion of the address,
Judge Wood invited the large as
semblage to'come forward and shake
hands with the next governor. ' But
he added, before you do it, I ask you
all to give three cheers for Hiram
W. Johnson. Three cheers were
given, and the crowd then began
surging on to the hotel porch .where a
hearty handshake was given every
extended hand, and a formal intro
ducction made by Dr. A. M. Gall,
who was standing to the side of. the
speaker. '
The band played the Star Spangled
Banner, which concluded the meeting.
At 2:30 p. m., the party again
seated themselves jh the autos, and
the run for Mokelumne Hill vvaq be
gun. The party spent the nigrht at
Angels Camp.
The crowd assembled; to hear the
speaker was estimated to be between
five and six hundred all told. The
schools of the city were dismissed
for the occassion, and the 'pupils
marched from the building to the
seats arranged in the street in front
of the National hotel.
This was without a doubt an excel
lent move on the part of the- school
principal, as it gave his pupils a
chance of hearing one of the most bril
liant speakers of which the state can
boast,'

Base Ball Enjoyed
Sutter Creek and Placerville base
ball teams crossed bata on the Sutter
diamond last Sunday, and Placerville
was defeated to the tune of 9 to 3.
Sutter Creek received a victory
which Jackson can feel proud of, as
five of the nine players were from the
county seat, and wore Jackson uni
forms.
Ilcding Boro ttitched for the Sutter
team, and it can be safely said his
balls are growing more puzzlcsome
each game he plays. Mis ball is easily
hit, but its peculiar twirl when in con
tact with the bat, becomes dead, and
seldom is struck into the outfield. A
largo buss carrying 14 Jackson fans
went over to the game, and every
available carriage also journeyed to
the busy town for a good game of ball.
Among Jackson players in the game
were Love, t s short stop, who received
a bad jolt on the neck while sliding to
a base Skelly, who played third base,
also received a bad injury to a to*
on the right foot; Will Boro, first
base. Walter Steel, right field. What
a pity that Jackson is not making a
better showing on her' own diamond,
which is one of the best grounds in the
foothills.
The new manager is everything that
can be desired, but the team has been
so badly managed by its old regime
that it will take a great deal of hard
work to again place Jackson on the
good ball line.
That the players are here, there is
no question. Cromer is, always re
liable, and as good a player as will
ever visit this section for first base.
Love 12 excellent material for second
base or short stop. Brown as catcher,
Steele, Brown, Coster as pitcher ;
Skelly, Jackson's popular third base
jnan on the third sack, Arditto, Fort
ner, the Vela boys can be placed in al
most any position on the team.
Jackson certainly should hold in
with the new manager, who has the
backbone to make a strong team pay
well, and furnish good games.
