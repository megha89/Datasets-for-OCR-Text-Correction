It is a suggestive fact not always
sufficiently considered that "as soon as
any organ or faculty falls into disuse
It degenerates and Is finally lost alto
gether." Through all the ages that
man has had the power of speech this
power has not been fixed in us in any
degree whatever by heredity. It is re
garded as definitely proved that if a
child of civilized parents were brought
up in a desert place and allowed no
communication whatever with man it
would never make any attempt at
speech.
Up to the last century it was not un
common to find persons living in a
wild state in the woods and forests of
England, France, Germany and Rus
sia who were- utterly incapable of
speech, though they could make sounds
in imitation of the cries of wild ani
mals. . Certain parasitic insects have
so completely degenerated that they

VOUGHIOGHENY.
Tbe Proper Way of Pronouncing This
Indian Name.
Perhaps the most difficult geograph
ical name in the United States is
Youghlogheny, or geny, as it Is some
times spelled, the name of "a creek in
western Maryland and Pennsylvania.
Few besides natives of the region pro
nounce it with the chief accent on the
penultimate and who so essays it with
the accent elsewhere finds his mouth
filled with a meaningless confusion of
vowels and consonants. The first syl
lable is "Yougb," pronounced "Yo,"
with a short "o." The second is."i"
short, the "o" following is almost if
not quite unheard in the mouth of the
native, while tbe last two syllables are
those made familiar la "Alleghany,"
though there is even here a question of
"a" long or "c" short.
The pronunciation of Youghiogheny
is, however, a simple matter with the
modern spelling compared to what it
must have seemed to the stranger who
met it with the old spelling. On an
ancient map of the region the name Is
spelled "Yogbyyoyghgania." Doubtless
this spelling came nearer than that
now in use to indicating aptly the In
dian pronunciation of the name.

""Why do they call it the palm room?"

Eggs In the Neat.
All birds have a systematic arrange

The Wins of a Bird.
The typical vertebrate limb, various
ly modified in the arm of a man or the
fore limb of a cat or frog or bird, has
one bone in the upper arm, which gives
support to two in the forearm, which
similarly yield to four at the wrist,
and from these five digits can just
comfortably be extended. The bird,
however, decided to fly rather than
grasp with its hand, so that three and
a half fingers are all it has retained of
the five which its reptilian ancestors
bequeathed to it

"A SECRET."
One great secret of youth and beauty for*
the young woman or the mother is the
proper understanding of her womanly sys-
tem and well-being. Every woman, young
or old, should know herself and her phys-
ical make up. A good way to arrive at
this knowledge is to get a good doctor
book, such, for instance, as the "People's
Common Sense Medical Adviser," by R. V.
Pierce, M. D., which can readily be pro-
cured by sending twenty-one cents in one-
cent stamps for paper-bound volume, or
thirty-one cents for cloth-bound copy, ad-
dressing Dr. R. V. Pierce, at Buffalo, N. Y.
The change from maidenhood to woman-
hood is one that involves the whole body.
The strain at this time upon the blood-

orders of the functions peculiarly feminine
are nearly always dependent ■ upon de-

Pierces Favorite Prescription is just the
vegetable tonic for the female system.
"I cannot express my thanks for the benefit I
have received from Dr. Pierces medicines,"
writes Mrs. Julius Wehrly, of Cambridge, Dor-

Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription was

NOTES OF DISCORD.
. The unsatisfactory- condition of
the industrial world, incident to the
frequency of labor strikes, is a prom
inent topic of conversation wherever
one goes. On a trip to San Fran
cisco the other day, two women
were relating their experience. Both
were married and had families. The
husband of one was a machinist,
who had been thrown out of a good
job by the strike on the Santa Fe
road. With his family he was visit
ing friends, waiting for the settle
ment of the trouble between the
great railroad corporation and its
"striking employes, and hoping that
the adjustment would soon be made
that he might return to his work.
The other lady was a miner's wife.
Her husband had worked in
Cuer de Lene district in Idaho, and
also in the Colorado fields. The
wages were good, and in the course
of a few months they managed to
save $600 or $700. A strike came
along and they had to move to seek
work elsewhere, and their savings
were dissipated in a few weeks. This
sort of experience had been repeated
several time's. No sooner had they
got settled, and were getting a little
ahead, than a strike was precipitated,
compelling them to make a fresh
start in life. It was evident from
tbe conversation indulged in that
the toilers were weary of this busi
ness; it was not to their taste. They
began to realize that an organiza
tion instituted for their benefit,
whicb is the fruitful source of in
augurating war instead of peace, is
detrimental to their interests. The
instances cited occurred in a small
railroad depot among tbe few pas
sengers therein awaiting transporta
tion to their respective destinations.
They serve to illustrate how wide
spread is the feeling, even among the
army of organized labor, that the
despotic methods of unionism to ad
vance the cause of the workingman
have signally failed to secure the
promised industrial millennium.. It
is a moot question to-day if the real
sentiment of the toiling masses were
allowed free expression, whether it
would not be found overwhelming in
favor of the old-established system
of every man's right to sell his labor
wherever and for whatsoever he
pleases, without let or hindrance of
any organization whatever. The
history of labor unions has been,
and doubtless will continue to be, a
never-ending round of organization,
disruption and re-organization.
The governor of Pennsylvania has
appointed Attorney-General P. C.
Knox successor to the late Senator
Mat Quay. The attorney-general
has signified his intention to accept,
which will necessitate the placing of
a new man in the cabinet. Presi
dent Roosevelt will no doubt secure
the right man for the place.

Excitement in Amador.
A report was started in Amador
Wednesday that 50 non-union men
were to be brought to the Fremont-
Gover from Placerville that evening.
Excitement ran high, and rumors
spread thick and fast. Trouble was
scented from a distance, and a deputy
sheriff was sent to prevent hostilities.
It proved to be the usual boomerang.
No one came, no trouble was had, and
the deputy came home a sleepy man.
Perhaps some one thought he was soon
to lose an easy job.

ARCTIC TEAVEL
[CONTINUED]
On the 12th of Feb., at 8 in the morn
ing, the Etage left Eagle for Dawson,
distance 102 miles, fare $25. Four
big horses drew a 4-6eated sleigh with
plenty of robes and eight passengers.
Jack Downing, the driver, is an old
"sour-dough," very proud of his team
and reputation for getting in on time.
The route is on the river, and great
skill is required to avoid hummocks
and crevices, the latter being especi
ally dangerous. After the first freeze
the river falls several feet, and the
cracks, chasms, and sloping slabs of ice
make travel quite risky. The ice that
comes floating down before the freeze
up, sometimes piles up in the river
bends more than 10 feet high.
We came 12 miles and crossed the
141 st meridian into Canada. Ten miles
further and we came to a road house,
where we warmed, changed horses and
had a good dinner. Just at dark we
reached Forty Mile, where we passed
the night and the custom house. At
7a. m. were again on the road, with
the same horses and three more pas
sengers, who had come down from
Jack Wade creek en route to the "out
side." The thermometer showed 38°
below zero, and our driver and. three
passengers had their faces frozen. Half
way to Dawson, where we stopped for
dinner and fresh horses, the body of a
man had just been brought in who had
frozen to death on the trail two miles
away, but less than 80 rods from a
woodcutter's cabin. ' v -
ITT , .
We arrived in Dawson at 7 in the
evening. The following day, Feb. 14th,
I celebrated my birthday by resting in
my room in the hotel, only going out
for meals. Feb. 16th I started on a
bicycle for White Horse. The route
lay up the Klondike for eight miles,
then up Hunker creek 19 more, to the
summit, beyond which is the head of
Dominion creek. Nearly the whole
distance placer mines are being worked
every 500 ' feet or less. Seen from a
short distance the great "dumps" of
pay dirt resemble hay stacks. All along
the route are saloons, stores and road
houses, and the whole region is "hum
ming." I stopped over night at the
Summit hotel. Next morning six
inches of fresh snow showed that the
wheel was out of business for a week at
least, so I put it on a stage that was
just leaving for White Horse and took
a seat by the driver. Dominion creek
is 38 miles long, and just as lively as
Hunker. These are two of the best
creeks in the Klondike district. They
have several towns, each having a few
hundred people, with stores, churches,
repair shops, etc. The next day we
had left the mining region and entered
the forests that cover the hills. The
third day we crossed the Stewart river,
which is navigable for steamboats, 265
miles from its confluence with the
Yukon. Crossed the Pelly river, four
miles above its mouth at Fort Selkirk,
where it unites with the Lewes and
forms the Yukon proper. Fifty miles
further up we crossed the Lewes, and
did not strike it again until we reached
White Horse, which is 330 miles by
stage route from Dawson, fare $75, ex
clusive of meals and lodging, which
average $5.50 per day. Three regular
stages leave each end of the route every
week, besides several extras. One day
a strange object showed up in the dis
tance, a square tent on a sleigh, with
smoke coming through a hole in the
roof. It was a cargo of fresh eggs en
route to Dawson, which the owner ex
pected to make money on if he could
keep them from freezing." Several dogs
followed our sleigh, and it was great
sport to watch them chase rabbits,
which were very plentiful. The light
snow was over two feet deep. Rabbits
could run on it, but the dogs would
sink almost out of sight. Their hunt
ing instinct would make them start
after every rabbit they saw, but after
floundering a few rods they would slink
sheepishly back to the road, only to re
peat the process the next time a rabbit
appeared. The latter seemed to roally
enjoy the fun.
On nearly every stage we met I no
ticed one or more bicycles, but did not
try to buy them although the owners
were willing to sell. When the road is
good a man can easily make 80 miles
a day with a wheel.
After eight days of staging I reached
White Horse, and never had a railroad
look so inviting. Travel to the interior
is the heaviest ever known at this sea
son. Every day one or two stages
start for Dawson, each carrying 11 pas
sengers. A stampede is on to the
Elsek diggings, 160 miles west of here,
said to rival the Klondike but not yet
so proven. Not more than one in ten
of these stampedes profit any except
the hotel and transportation men. Still
it is not reasonable to suppose that
Nome and the Klondike are the only
very rich places in the north, and more
bonanzas are liable to be struck any
time.
On Feb. 28th I arrived in Skagway
not much the worse for wear, and glad
I had made the trip, but like the boy
after a dinner of pusley greens, who
liked what he had had but didn't want
any more. Sincerely,
C. H. G.
For a Hundred Years.
For a hundred years or more Witch
Hazel has been recognized as a super
ior remedy, but It remained for E. C.
DeWitt & Co. of Chicago, to discover
how to combine the virtues of Witch
Hazel with other antiseptics, in the
form of a salve. De Witt's Witch Hazel
Salve is the best salve in the world for
sores, cuts, burns, bruises and piles.
The - high standing of this salve has
given rise to counterfeits, and the public
is advised to look for the name "De-
Witt" on the package, and accept no
other. Sold by City Pharmacy.

Camp Fires.
Campers should be very careful this
season about fire. The unusual growth
of grass during the spring has left a
heavy covering of dry straw on the
ground. A spark from a camp-fire or
the burning embers of an unextinguish
ed fire may cause the loss of thousands.
It only takes a few minutes to cover
the fire with dirt or throw on a few
pails of water. Take the time. It
means peace of mind to you, and may

by locai applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear
There is only one way to cure deafness,
and that is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an iniluincd con
dition of the mucous lining of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in-
Qamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can be
tuken out and this tube restored to its
normat condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars
for any case of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free.

Interesting Conrt Proceeding
In the Superior Court last Monday a
petition was presented to set asido a
decree of distribution entered some
time ago in favor of the widow of E. R.
Hanford, deceased. The petition was
argued by Attorney F. J. Solinsky and
testimony in support of same was given
by Wm. M. Nuner, Jr. The matter is
a little out of the ordinary and a simi
lar case has not before appeared in this
court. According to law, when an es
tate is valued at less than $1500 is
directed that the Court award the same
for distribution to the widow. This was
done in this case, but the widow again
married before distribution was made
and the children seek to have the order
set aside. The matter was submitted to
the Court for a decision.— Calaveras
Chronicle.
A 5400,000 Damage Suit.
The damage suit fors4oo,ooo brought
some time ago by Gilbert E. Gould
against J. J. Schmadeke and the Libra
Mining Company was disposed of in a
short space of time in the superior
court last Tuesday. The complaint
claimed that Schmadeke, as represent
ative of the Libra Mining Co., executed
to J. P. Clapp a bond for the sale of
the so-called Blair mine at Angels, and
that the company failed to keep the
agreement to convey the property, and
sued for a breach of contract. Defend
ants appeared Tuesday represented by
Attorneys. F. J. Solinsky and F. B.
Shea, but the plaintiff and his attor
neys failed to appear. Defendants in
troduced evidence, and the court
directed that a decree be entered to
the effect that plaintiff get nothing and
that defendant get judgment and costs
of action. —Citizen. .
Off for lone-
Prof. Williams aud his grammar
grade pupils hired two .rigs Friday
evening and started on their way re
joicing to atteud the commencement
exercises of the lone union high school.
The party arrived in lone and suc
ceeded in taking in the town before the
evening's exercises began. The pro
gramme proved to be a most interest
ing one, and so delighted the young
people from Jackson that they con
cluded to attend the dance that had
been arranged to take place after the
entertainment. The Prof, objected at
first, but being only one but of a dozen,
and all of them grammar grade grad
uates at that, he was finally overruled
and had to submit gracefully. Being a
man who is not only heavy set but rather
set in his way, he landed iv the surrey on
the homeward trip with a solidity that
boded ill for those who sat on the op
posite side. All the occupants noticed
how tbe vehicle tipped his way, and
remarked that they believed they
would tip over. Williams only grinned
and awaited bis opportunity. Finally
the horses shied and Williams, so the
driver says, threw his ponderous weight
on the lower side and over went the
rig with all its occupants. The pro
fessor got up laughing, thinking that
he had at last played even with a lot of
them at least. When daylight appear
ed it was noticed that his hair was
almost white, showing that he himself
had been badly frightened. No one
was hurt, and the class agreed to pay
all damages if Williams would agree
not to tell the reporters.

Governor Pardee Commutes Several Sen
tences Before Going East.
Governor Pardee has announced the
granting of the following commutation
of sentences:— John Bryan of Sonoma
county, to expire July 11. Bryan was
sentenced to twenty years for. burglary
and has served twelve years. Commu
tation recommended by justices of the
supreme court.
Richard Dalton, sentenced to six
years for taking a bicycle while drunk
and giving it to a stranger. Dalton
has served five years.
J. J. Thornton, of Solano county,
sentenced for life for robbing a trunk
for a small sum of money will be set
free June 27, by recommendation of
sentencing judge and justices of the
supreme court.
Douglas Berry, doing 100 days in the
county jail ofAlameda county, com
muted for ill-health.
A conditional commutation has been
granted in the case of Jack Brooks,
sentenced for life, murder in the second
degree, from Fresno county. Brooks,
in company with "others, made a run
ning fight with a man named Donnelly,
who was killed. After Brooks' con
viction Ardall. a saloonkeeper, and
Rice, a police officer, were tried on the
same charge, and it was proved that
Brooks did not fire the fatal shot.
Rice was cleared on the ground that
as a peace officer he was justified in
shooting. Brooks will be free in 1906,
and the governor holds that according
to the supreme, court he demonstrated
a vindictivenesb in pursuing and shoot
ing at Donnelly that was not warrant
ed, and he should be punished to some
extent.
Celebration at Plymouth.
Plymouth has a clear field this year
so far as celebrations are concerned in
Amador county. That she will be
equal to the task she has undertaken
no one doubts for a moment. Her peo
ple are enterprising and never do things
by halves. All that is on tho program
will be carried out to the letter. It
will be worth your time and money to
see the three curios spoken of in the
Ledger some time ago, two of which
are at Coster's drug store and one at
Norman Wheeler's residence. It will
undoubtedly be one of the grandest
celebrations ever held in this county.
The game wardens made three ar
rests during the week for shooting
doves out of season. One in Jackson
and two in Amador. One $25 and one
$50 fine was paid. The other case is
pending.

Shooting Affray.
Oc Friday of last week, at the Rich
Gulch hotel, six miles above Mokel
uruno Hill, a shouting affray occurred
that will long- be remembered by the
citizens of that place, resulting in the
killing of one man and the badly
wounding of another. Mr. Lench,
proprietor of the hotel, had some dif
ficulty in settling with one of his board
ers by the name of Jahns, or better
known as the "Crazy Dutchman."
After a wordy dispute Mr. Jahns se
cured a horse and rude to San Andreas,
where he imbibed freely and told of his
troubles. la the afternoon he obtained
a rifle ami asserted that he was going
back to the hotel at Rich Gulch and
even up mattnrs by killing Mr. Lench.
With the matter weighing heavily
upon bis mind he proceeded to carry
out his threat. Arriving at the hotel
the first person be saw was bartender
Evans, a relative by marriage of the
proprietor, and raisin £ his gun he shot
Evans squarely in the forehead, killing
him instantly. Mr. Lench hearing the
shooting seized his shot gun and ran to
the relief of Evans, where he beheld
Jahns trying to get another cartridge
into the rifle. Taking in the situation
hie raised his gun ai.rl shot Jahns
through the right shoulder, inflicting
an ugly and painful wound, but not
necessarily a fatal one. Dr. Endicott
of Jackson was called in consultation
with a Calaveras doctor. They care
fully dressed the wouod, and the
authorities took the wounded man to
San Andreas on Saturday. Mr. Lench
is a highly respected citizen- of his lo
cality. Evans was about 27 years of
age, a good citizen, and esteemed by
all who knew him. He leaves a young
wife to mourn his untimely death.
Whiskey exciting an already addled
brain is said to have been the principal
cause of the tragic affair.
Lodi vs. Jackson.
Sunday will be the first time that the
people of Jacksou have had the oppor
tunity of witnessing two games of base
ball in one day under the same roan
agement and by the same teams since
the introduction of the game into the
county as a Sunday pastime. Mr.
Burgin, manager of the Jackson nine,
has iuducod the Lodi team to be pres
ent on that day and play .twp games
with the best team that it is possible to
gut together in this part of thecounty at
the present time. He is sparing neither
time nor money to make the stay of
the visiting team a pleasant one, and
at the saitin Lime be has put forth every
effort to secure a home teanj tfoat it
will be next to impossible to defeat.
Both games ought to be interesting.
The Lodi boys are good players and
every man of them understands the
game. The blue rock shooting is also
an attractive feature and will help to
swell the crowd. The following is the
line-up of both teams and is a sufficient
guarantee that both games will be
hotly contested and prpbably witnessed
by the greatest number of people that
ever assembled on Dwyer's hill:
Lodi. Jackson.

Xbe American Eagle.
Sheriff Norman has added another
to his extensive collection of curios in
the shape of a real American eagle.
The bird was killed by C. H. Page pf
the Standard KlecU-ip Company, apd
presented to Mr. Norman, who sent it
to W. J. Hackmeier, taxidermist of
San Francisco, and had it mounted,
showing J,he bjrd in a pqsjtiqn ready tp
battle with an enemy- It measures
six feot from tip to tip, and is beauti
fully feathered, making it a rare speci
men of its kind. Jt will occupy a
prominent ppsitiqn in the office, and
will no doubt be the main attraction of
the court house for some time, not
withstanding the popular county of
ficials. The doer head showing the
moss covered antlers is said to be one
of the finest specimens ever mqunted in
San Francisco. The sheriff and bis
deputies take pleasure in showing the
curios to persons who visit the office.
A Becord Breaker.
Last Sunday was a record breaker
for matrimonial ventures in Jackson.
Four couples were joined for life or
otherwise, and set sail on voyages that
may he smooth and profitable or roclfy
and turbulent,, as they phopse tq make
them. Marriage licenses have been in
great demand so far during leap year,
and if tho ratio continues the revenue
from this source will be greater than
for many years. This ought to show
to the marriageable ypupg men that
the girls are willing to make a venture,
and arc not afraid to say so when it
comes their turn to have the say.
Farewell Party.
Friday evening a number of the
young people of Jackson gathered at
Love's hall on invitation of a com
mittee who had arranged a farewell to
Miss Mary . Hall, whq left th.c next
morning fqr an extended visit with an
uncle in Seattle. Singing, dancing,
and social chat made the evening pass
pleasantly. At a late hour the young
folks wished Miss Hall a pleasant jour
ney and a safe return tq tho home of
her friends.
Gone Eait.
J. H. Lowry, of Pine Grove, who has
lived in Amador county for fifty years,
started for Utah last week to visit a
brother whom he has nqt seen for
many years. After a short stay in
Utah the two brqthers will go tp their
old home in Illinqls, and frqm tfyece to
tho world's fair at St. Louis. Mr.
Lowry expects to be gone about three
months. He will resume his business

Notes By the Way.
June 19—1 send a few notes dotted
down while traveling on the train be
tween Cheyenne and Denver. It .was
nearly midnight before we got fairly
started on the trip to the World's Fair
from the Sacramento depot, the delay
of nearly an hour being occasioned by
the congestion of passenger traffic in
cident to the excursion rates to St.
Louis. The increased travel and the
confusion necessarily arising from the
stopover privileges allowed to tourists,
are the terror of the conductors all
along the line. The remark is freely
made by railroad employes that they
hope there will never be another
world's fair. From start to finish this
cry of distress is more or less heard.
Having ample time during the seven
hours' stay in Sacramento, I did not
order tickets in advance. It took the
agent one and a half hours to make out
the two tickets for mvsi-lf and Mrs.
Webb. It was not owliig to delay in
deciding upon the route. That was
soon settled, going by the Central Pa
cific and Union Pacific, by way of Den
ver, and return by way of New Orleans
and the Sunset route. The tickets are
frequently a yard long, and the map
ping out of the route by the sections of
the tickets is a study for the agents.
The ticket holder often gets mixed as
to the course of procedure on the route,
and the conductors and other officials
get puzzlod at every turn to unravel
the mysteries of these wonderful ex
cursion tickets. '.•'XV*
Through the Sierras in night time
and the sagebrush state in day light
the trip was without special interest.
The writer passed through Nevada
thirty years ago, and while towns along
the railroad have grown, in several
cases, beyond recognition since the
early 70's, the geueral characteristics
of the treeless, sagebrush waste re
mains the same. That this uninviting
desert possesses vast agricultural possi
bilities is evident from what has been
accomplished in isolated spots. The
valley of the Humboldt, now surrend
ered to stockraising, awaits but the
magic touch pf irrigation to, transform
it into smiling fields of grain and gar
den, equaling in fertility the watered
regions of Utah and Colorado.
Reaching Ogden early Thursday
morning we took a side trip to Salt
Lake City, remaining there until next
morning. This preatjpn qf the Latter
Day Saints— founded in 1g74 by Brig
ham Young and his fellow religious
zealots under the impression that Gen
tile ways would not reaoh their wilder
ness home for a century— is conceded
at this day tp be a raadel pjty'. Those
Mormon piqneers^-whatever may be
said of their doctrinal teaching—plan
ned wisely and well as regards their
temporal Zion. What impresses the
visitor with admiration are th,e living
streams flowing pn either side of the
streets. These advantages are not
possessed to anything like the same ex
tent in any other city of its size in the
United States. Jn the center qf tftese.
thorough fares are placed the electric
poles fqr power and light— another
feature peculiar tq Salt Lake. On
either side tho street, car lines are
operated, one side for the qutgqing and
the other sjdo for- th,e inclining, cars.
There js. no, cpnfus.ion, and no danger
in getting on or off the cars of colliding
with passing cars. Such an arrange
ment of course would not be practicable
were it not for the unusual width o.f
the streets, thqrq heing ample room
for other vehicle traffic outside the car
lines. It is never found necessary to
cross the car lines by drivers of buggies
or wagons. Salt Lake is growing
apace. Her business if,en p,ru.dlpt 4
population of IQQ.QOq in 1906.
A mpre detailed account pf sights at
Salt Lake and also at Denver we must
reserve fqr a futu.ro qceasiot). We are
now in Denver, Sunday noon, and
about to start for St. Louis, both in
good health and enjoying the trip
thqrpnghly. R. W. '

NOTES FROM
GOLD MINES
The Bunker Hill, Keystone, Central
Eureka, Oneida, Kennedy and Zeila,
are running with full crews both night
and day.
Fremont-Gover— The sand ques
tion is now retarding the starting up
of this property. It is to be hoped
that the owners of the town lots will
look to their own interests and not ex
pect exorbitant damages for fancied
injuries.
Empire-Pacific— Rumors are afloat
that the E mpire or . Pacific, and . prob
ably both, will be operated again in
the near future. The unsettled con
dition of labor has been taken into con
sideration by the owners.
Bay State— This mine In Plymouth
district is said to be running with the
usual number of men. The prospects
are growing more favorable every day
of this mine developing into a good
paying property.
Wildma'n-Mahonev— A few men
are doing top work preparatory jto
operating these mines: Superintend
ent Ross is in San Francisco on busi
ness connected with these properties.
South Eureka— The mill .is
silent and mining operations are virtu
ally at a standstill. For some reason
unknown to many of the stockholders
active operations were suspended after
a $15,000 clean-up for the last month's
run.
Argonaut — Operations are pro
gressing favorably at this mine. The
stockholders a.re looking forward to the
time when this will' again become the
most famous bullion producer in the
county, > ? .'~r. '■•".;-■' .•■•-. •■*■
Bohool Entertainment-
We unintentionally omitted the
school entertainment last week. The
affair was a most creditable one, and
young people wb,Q wqrk qnd make a
success of such things bo early in life
should be given every encouragement
to stimulate them to greater efforts.
There was no feature of the entertain
ment that did not bring credit to those
who took part. The singing was ex
ceptipnally good, while the instrumental
music and recitations were all that
pould be expected from pupils of Aeir
ages. The farce was well rendered and
greatly pleased the parents and friends
present. Great credit is due those
who assisted the young people in
hecoming so proficient in their work.
.Typhoid-
Typhoid is quite prevalent In Jftck
eon, aqd (s rsgiflg in. the Pioneer sec
tifli}. It came apparently without a
cause, and is spreading in both places.
Those towns and localities not yet af
fected hy it sh.qu.ld. ta,k.e every pre
pau,t,iqn to, ajgid *&£ dreaded malady.
Those who have any symptoms of the
disease should not hesitate to consult
their family physician. If taken in
time it may be checked, hut if neglect
ed, at first it m^t W US POWraq- .One
(ady in piqnegr ha^ been down 50 days.
Jf she recovors it will leave her in an
emaciated condition, and perhaps im
pair her health for years to come.
Now is the time to be careful, and pre
vent its further sp,r.ead if possible.
Stop Piping.
A few days ago one of the debris
commissioners arrived) jq Yp,lcanp, and
made $n }nsp,ec.tip,n p,f Yftrious
hydraqlic qines. IJe visited, the Ele
phant claim and expressed himself as
perfectly satisfied, with, dams, etc, and
tuld the men to jro ahead. A few days
after his return to Sacramento the
company received word to stop piping.
Just what it all means no one seems to
know. It would be a grea,t }n]us%o to
these i men, aj fear. bavins worked so
faithfully to uncover the gravel, not to
be allowed to clean up properly. There
must be something wrong with the re
port that we received, or else some
underhanded work hqs. has^ s^ing on.
?aid the Penalty.
Francesca Qcho# who, murdered
Marie B,arr}e at Bakersgeld. \n 1899 was
executed Friday morning last, June 10,
at 0:30 o'clock at the San Quentin
Prison. Ochoa ascended the scaffold
and when the noose was brought to
him he thrust his head through the
loop. Such an act wqs, gayer before
seen "gt th,e prison. The trap was
sprung at U:2B but Ochoa was not pro
nounced dead until 9:46.' This is the
longest time that any one executed at
the prison has ever lingered. Oc.hoa

Oo Visiting.
A score or more of Jackson's fairest
Rebekahs went to lone Wednesday to
visit the valley lodge and meet one of
th^e gran,d officers, who is giving in
structions in the secret and drill work
of the order. They were a jolly com
pany before starting. We have not
seen them since their return.
Republican Convention.
The republican national convention
has been in session all the week, but up
to the time of going to press no nomina
tions have formally been made. The
nominee for president was selected by
the people of the United States months
before the convention met, and there is
nothing left for the convention to do in
that respect but to ratify the people's
choice. Senator Fairbanks seems to
be alone in the fight for the vice presi
dency, and the next republican ticket
will undoubtedly be Roosevelt and
Fairbanks. The convention is com
posed of the ablest men of the nation.
Ex-Secretary Root was temporary
chairman, and Speaker J. G. Cannon
is permanent chairman. The framing
of the platform and appointing of com
mittees has occupied the time so far.
The California delegation has received
favorable consideration in the selection
of committees. The platform as out
lined is a strong one, and it seems to be
the prevailing opinion of all the dele
gates that the republican nominees wili
be chosen by the largest majority ever
given to presidential candidates since
the organization of the republican
party. W&&
Baseball at the Hill,
The Jackson team went to Mokel
umne Hill Sunday and took part in a
close and exciting game, the score at
the close standing 9 to 10 in favor of
the Hill boys. Tell us a different story
next time boys. - We would like to
chronicle something new.
Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign.
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. For
weak digestion, for defective nourish
ment, for consumption, take Scott's
Emulsion. It restores flesh because it
strikes to the cause of the loss.

Seventh Grade Promotion Diplomas
have been printed at the Ledger office,

Preston School Contracts.
We notice that many of the contracts
let by the board of trustees for the fur
nishing of supplies for the Preston
School were given to local men. This
is a move in the right direction. So
long as the business men of lone can
furnish the supplies at reasonable rates
they should be allowed to do so. The
success of any new institution depends
largely upon the good will of the peo
ple in the community wherein it is lo
cated. At the present time the school
U receiving stronger support from the
citizens of lone than it has received for
years. The letting of these contracts
will tend to strengthen rather than
retard this feeling.

Mokelnmne Hill Will Celebrate.
I The citizens of the town have dug
down in their jeans and put up the
necessary wherewith to have a grand
celebration on the coming Fourth, and
the necessary preparations are now go
ing on under the charge of a competent
committee. The town will be decorated
from top to bottom, and the day will
be ushered in by the firing of a salute
and the rendering of national airs by
the band. Jacob P. Snyder of San An
dreas will deliver an oration, and . Miss
Maud Day, daughter of F. H. Day of -
this place, will read the Declaration of
Independence, also singing by a glee
club. During the forenoon there will
be athletic sports of every description
held on the plaza, to the winners of
which good prizes will be given. At *
two o'clock in the afternoon a match
game of baseball will be played on the
Juri diamond for a purse of $50 between
the San Andreas and Jackson clubs.
Then there will be a flag drill by
twenty young ladies, and a 20-round
glove contest for a purse of $100, the
whole to conclude with a grand ball in *
the evening. — Caiaveras Chronicle.

An exciting runaway occurred on
Broadway Tuesday, in which Charley
Tarn and a frightened horse were the
principal actors. Charley was thrown
from the cart and bruised a little. The
cart, which belonged to Pete Cassinelli,
was somewhat demolished, and the
horse when caught was tied in a near
by barn to let him cool off and get over
his fright before taking him home. A
defective bridle caused the trouble.

THE BAD RUPEE.
Bahrain Got Rid ot It, bnt Not the
War He Intended.
"There lived in Rampur, India, a
vender of sweetmeats named Bahram.
whose wife had weak eyes," said the
story teller. "One day this man went
to see a friend at the bazaar, and he
left his stiill in the woman's charge.
'Be careful, mind you, about the
change,' he said to her. But neverthe
less when ho returned home he found
that she had taken In a bad rupee
piece. He could hardly sleep that night
for rage aiul sorrow. In the morning
he arose early, and, determined to get
rid of the bad rupee, he set out through
the town, yoon he met a boy. •
" 'Boy,' he said, 'do you know the
sweetmeat shop of AH?' (AH was a
rival vender.) 'Well, take this rupee,
go to All's shop and spend a pice for
sweetmeats there. The sweetmeats
you may keep; I want the change.'
"The boy departed merrily and in a
little while returned with his mouth
full.
" 'So you got the change without trou
ble, eh?' said the man as he counted it.
'And did All make no examination of
the rupee?' v\ ■
"'Oh,' said the boy, 'I didn't go as
far as All's. I got the sweetmeats at
Bahram's shop.' "—London Modern So

ROCK FORMATION.
In One Sense Stones Do Grow, and
In Another They Do Not.
Rocks do not grow in the sense that
plants do. They may increase In size
by means of accretion, and they may
also undergo other changes. Old sea
beds, lifted up and exposed for ages, be
come stratified beds of sandstone or
limestone; volcanic ashes and lava
strewn over hills and plains become
tufa, hard enough for building stone,
and the pebbly shores of rivers and
smaller streams may sometimes
change into conglomerates. The simple
mineral, however, does grow, especial
ly when it takes upon itself the form
of a crystal. A sparkling prism of
quartz increases from an atom to
monster crystals of varying length and
size by what geologists know as a
"process of addition aud assimilation."
this process is wonderfully slow, but
with a mathematical exactness that is
a surprise to persons even "well up"
in the science of geology. In one sense
6tones grow; in another they do not.
The crystal may become longer and
larger, but the bowlder on the roadside
will not increase a hairbreadth in
length or width in the next 10.000
years.
Moat Horrible of All Dreams.
No words are strong enough to point
out the danger of slow poisoning by
drugs which are often taken to procure
sleep, whether it be an alcoholic night
cap, morphine, opium, chloral or any
other. The medical man has recourse
with reluctance to these as a last and
temporary resort, and only he enn tell
how many lives are wrecked by the
ill timed use of them and their subse
quent abuse. Of all horrible dreams
none is so awful as those which assail
people who habitually use these false
comforters. Better than all the drugs
In the world for procuring sleep are
simple food, a regular life and a calm
mind.— Cassell's.
Its Hurtful Sedentary Habit.
"I think," said the meditative boy,
"that a wasp would be all right if it
didn't get tired."
"Eh?" replied his father. "Where did
you get that idea?"
"Why, one day I got a wasp on my
hand, and while he was walking
around* he was all right He didn't
hurt till he stopped to sit down."—

CURIOUS WORSHIP.
The Custom of Throwing Prayers At
an Idol In Japan.
Along the sacred road of Nikko, in
Japan, Is an idol about which centers
one of the most curious worships in
the world. Upon the surface of the
statue are seen little pieces of what
appears to be dried paper. If you stand,
by the Idol for awhile and wait for a
worshiper to come along, you will see
what these bits of paper are. The dev
otee halts in front of the image, then
scribbles a prayer on a bit of the pa
per. The wad he then chews up Into
a ball and hurls at the god. If it
hits the face and sticks, the prayer is
sure to be granted, and the pious pil
grim goes away happy. If the ball
sticks to some portion of the body, the
omen is not quite so propitious, and If
it falls to the ground there is absolute
ly no hope.
Such a mode of prayer is even more
curious than the praying wheels of the
Buddhists, who set the wheel revolving
and reel off prayers by machinery. As
John L. Stoddard, the lecturer, said:
"One sees, of course, numberless
strange rites connected with religion
In traveling about the world, but
Japan Is the only land I have ever
visited where deities serve us .targets
for masticated, prayers!"

out doing so Is a marvel, but somehow
or other they do. Some eyes are nntu-:
rally more moist than others, and the
very moist eye does not so much need
the assistance of the lids to keep the
eyeball bright. It Is a constitutional
matter, for winking, though under the
control of the will, Is done so quickly
that It is practically an Involuntary ac
tion. Men wink when they feel that
the eye Is uncomfortably dry, and
when It does not become dry the neces
sity for winking Is not felt.
To Preserve the Color of Floivera."
A way to preserve the colors of flow
ers when pressing them is to immerse
the stem of the fresh plant in a solu
tion of 31 grains of alum, 4 of niter and
186 of water for a day or two, until
the liquid is absorbed, then press the
plant ln the usual way, sift some dry
sand over the flower and. submit to a
gentle heat for about twenty hours.
The Funny Bone.
A most unpleasant sensation is caused
by the violent excitation of the ulnar
nerve due to a blow on the elbow. This
nerve passes down on the inner side of
the arm and then ratheV inconsiderate
ly bends round and enters the forearm
at the 4tack of the elbow Joint. Any
one who has felt his neighbor's elbow
sticking into his ribs knows that the
elbow is remarkably deficient In flesh.
The nerve is therefore at this point
very near the surface and has little to
shield it from a blow. If we are bo
unfortunate as to give our elbow a
smart tap we obtain a practical con
firmation of the fact that the ulnar
nerve is the principal sensory nerve of
the forearm and hand.
Nature and Woman.
"Nature never grows old," said Bar
low.
"Yes, she docs," said Hawkins, "but
she is enough of a woman to be able
to conceal her age effectually."

I For nearly four years I suffered H

strongly objected to an operation. R
My husband felt disheartened as |

him to get a bottle of Wine of §3

"DARAMOUNT is one of the handsomest

the very best. Those who raise colts by thjs
beautiful young horse can consider themselves
fortunate. A tougher, more hardy, or better
formed horse never lived. His sire "Old Alta-
mont" was the greatest sire of extreme speed
in his day, having seven in the 3:10 list. There
are but two or three of his sons in the State,
and Paramount out-classes them all in beauty
and breeding. Paramount's dam, Nancy, by
Engineer, son of the Great Electioneer, was a
beautiful mare with extreme speed but never
was raced,
