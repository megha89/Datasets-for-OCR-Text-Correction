JACKSON. AMADOU COUNTY. OAUJfOKNIA. tfIUIJAY. MAY 28, 1909.
Organization of
Board of Trade.
A mnsi meeting wns hold mi Moo
day nfteruoon In the superior court
room, callori for the purpose of
consldoring the question of forming
an organization for the promotion
of the interests of Jackson aud Ama
dor county generally. Tho city was
canvassed tbe latter port of last
week, resulting In nn nlmost unani
mous pnntimont in fnvor nf the im
medlate organization for" Unit pur
pose. 11. I'J. Kay took nn active part
in this preliminary work. At tbo
hour appointed tho business com
munity generally turned out iv
innss. aud poured into the court
room, crowding it to tbe doors. Tbo
JuukßOU Military hand, voluntoered
its aid iv rendering music before
and during tho meeting.
Promptly at 1:80 p. bi.'J C. P.
Violul was elected chairman or tbe
gathering, and W. 11. Ureeubalgn
was chosen secretary, aud both
officials made some well choanu re
marks setting foith tbe need of a
movemeut ot this kind, und tbe
various nays iv which it could be
made to promote tbe interests of tbo
city and the county.
K. Webb said tbat bid idea was that
this was merely a preliminary
meeting, preparation to tbe forma
tion of a permanent organization.
Tbat the officers now selected were
merely temporary— the officers of tbe
proaont meeting. That tbe proper
time for the selection of permanent
oHioere was when tbe committees to
be appointed, had reported, setting
forth the objects and aims of the
association.'
Dr. Endioott moved that tbe
officers already named be made tbe
permanent officers.
H. Webb thought this was unadvis
alile at this time, before tbe rules
and regulations for tbe guidance ot
the sooiety bad been adopted. He
believed It was necesasry to keep the
movement aloof from politics, and
from otlJce holders, or office .seekers;
business men were otiiefly oonoerned,
'and they should have the manage
ment of its affairs, lie complimented
the. people of. Jackson in ■ taking
aotlon toward organization, ■ and
trusted it would be the beginning of
an era good feeling and earnest work
for tbe upbuilding ot tbe city and
county. However, realizing tbat tbe
feeling was toward making the
officers named the permanent
otileials, he withdrew opposition
thereto.' .
Alfonso (Jinocchio waa thereupon
elected treasurer.
'It was then moved and carried that
a committee on constitution and
by-laws be' appointed,- consisting of
tbree person's, to be named by the
chairman. '
The chair thereupon named as
such committee: K. Webb, 0. M.
Kelley, Alfred Uoldner. It was then
moved and carried that a committee
of five, be appointed by tbe chair to
take ' charge ot tbe affairs of the
organization pending tbe adoption
of constitution and by-laws to be
reported by that committee to tbe
meeting to be hereafter called.
L'his committee was selected as
follows: Dr. Wilson, V. 8. Uarbarnii,
N. Marelia, Dr. C. Sobaobt and J.
A. Laugbtou.
W. J. McUee moved that a roll of
membership bo opened forthwith,
and that each member pay an initi
ation fee of SI. Carried.
The roll was then opened, and 82
members signed, planking down 91
each as a financial starter.
A vnte of thauks was tendered to
the Jackson Military band for its
voluntary and valuable aid in fur
thering tbe meeting. Tbe following
persons signed tbe roll of member

ing before tbe strike occurred.
Tbey speak very favorably of the out
look fur tbo copper mine, and believe
it will develop into a good paying
mine, ibe ore carries copper, - gold
and silver; tho gold alone being
sufficient to pay expenses. It is on
tbe same lead as tbe Camp \ Heoo
mine, aud tbat is considered a' very
handsomely paying mine.' Ibe lone
mine is tunning on a small scale,
with less tban 20 men. For testing
purposes there is a. tbree stamp mill
on tbe ground. A boarding aud
sleeping houso are connected with the
miue, and tbe employes all board
on tbe premises.

MINING NOTES.
,\ll the mines are fast getting
eibwu to a full working basis. The
Argouaut mill was expected, to re
start some time this week. The
damage caused by tbe cessation of
work in -tho shaft • und drifts was
considerable, and involved a week or
more to repair. There is no trouble
in getting all the men needed. The
Zeila mill was also started again this
week with tbe full number of stamps.
The Kennedy mill is running full
banded as before tbe recent trouble.
At the Bunker Hill, the management
expected to be able to start tbe mill
tbe middle ot tbe week. Tbe straight
ening out of tbe shaft, which nos
contemplated if tbe labor troubles
bad continued, will not be under
taken at present. This would have
necessitated the stoppage of milling
operations during tbe continuance
of this work. It has been deemed
best-to postpone it, so tbat tbe mill
is no doubt ere this running to its
full capacity. At tbe Fremont sink
ing is in order, so tbat only a com
paratively small force is employed.
A letter lrnm Camp Seco nays:
"After a shut down for eighteen days
we started the miue up again with a
half a orew, although we expect to be
running with v full force in a few
days as tbe men are coming back on
every stage."

D. A. PATTERSON
DIES SUDDENLY.
County Recorder and Pioneer ot
' Amador County.
A shook was giveu this community
Tuesday rooming by the report that
David A. Patterson, who baa been
county recurder for the past sixteen
years, bad passed away at bis Lome
on Hamilton traot. Tne report came
as a surprise as well as a shock,' for
few outside of the family knew that
he was dangerously ill. He has been
sufferer from cbrouio rheumatism
for many years, and was crippled by
tbat aflection, as well as by.. a fall
which be sustained some six years
ago from the steps of the ball of re
cords. In consequence of his ail
ments be bad to be wheeled to and
from between bis borne and bis oliioo
tor the past six years, and for a long
period during tbat time be was toe
ill to leave the house. For the last
year or two, he appeared to Improve
and was able to attend the office
daily, and take a part in the woik of
recording documents. Up to Mon
day of last week, be was well enough
to do this. This was his last day iv
the office. He started to record a
deed for Volz to Victor that day.
He got through the deed proper, and
started in on tbe acknowledgement,
but left it unfinished. Ibe following
day he was unable to leave the house.
On Krldny he was much worse. No
regular medioal praotitioner attended
him in bis last illness. He was a
believer in tbe new cult— Christian
Science, and a healer of this sect
came up from l.odi to treat him,
staying until Monday morning, when
she left for her home. At this time
he seemed much improved, and ex
pressed his belief tbat the uext day
bo would be able to get to the court
bouse.
Tuesday morning, he said he felt
bettor. He wanted something to eat,
and Mrs Patterson, shortly before
eight o'clook, started to - prepare
breakfast for him. After doing this,
sbe returned to the sick obamher,
utul found a noticeable change. His
eyes were rolling aud glassy, and be
was uuoonsclous. His Bon-iu law,
Dr. Wilson was hastily summoned,
also two daughters, Mrs liierce and
Mrs Wilson. Dr. Cull was sent for,
but when he reached tbe soeue tbe
patient had passed from life to death.
Tbe end cam* altogether unexpect
edly, ami was a great shook to the
family aud the community in general.
As no qualitled ptaolitloner bad at
tended him iv hia fatal Illness, the
alarming pbysloial oouditiou of tho
patient waa unknown, even to bis
relatives, lie euterod the shadow ot
death with the expressed belief upon

his lips that he was decidedly better.
The question of furnishing a
medioal certificate of the cause, of
death became a pernloxiCß. Dr. Oall
had not attended him professionally,
and so could not. certify as his
medioal attended. Of course, the
Christian Scientist.- healer who did
attend was not qualified to issue a
certificate. The matter was referred
to the state board of health, and the
reply was, tbat under tbe circum
stances it would be necessary to
hold a coroner's inquest.
Coroner Potter came over Tuesday
evening, and held a coroner's in
quest. It was a formal affair, tbe
object being to seoure a burial per
mit by an anthoritative statement of
the cause of death. After hearing
the evidence showing that deceased
in his last sickness fluttered from
hemorrhage, a verdict was reached,
tbat be came to his death from con
jection of the lungs. No autopsy
was held.
David K. Patterson was one of tbe
pioneers of Amador county. He took
a part iv the war with Mexico, and
thereafter in tbe midst ot tbe ex
citement incident to the gold dis
covery, settled in this county. He
was a genial, whole souled man, and
honored and respected by all who
came witbin the circle of bis ao
quaintanoo. , Prior to his election to
tbe office of recorder, he served two
terms as supervisor of township five.
He was a member of tbe Masonia
fraternity, aud under tbe auspices ol
tbat order the funeral services were
held yesterday.
Deceased was a veteran of tbe war
with Mexico, and was drawing a
pension for services rendered therein.
As this war ooourred in 1318, he was
at tbat time, aocording to tbe most
authentic data that can be given of
bis age, between 15 and 16 years old
when he enlisted; bis ago at tbe time
of bis death being given as 77 yours 7
months and '21 days. Ijittle authentic
data can be gathered of bis early
hintory after coming to Amador
county. Mo biographical sketch of
his life baa been printed either iv the
Amador County History or tbe IHo
graphioal History of Nurtbein Cali
fornia.
He was married to Mrs Alice Vance
May 24. 1000.
The funeral services were conduct

THE BOARD OF TRADE MOVEMENT.
The preliminary steps toward the establishment of a
board of trade iv Jackson, have awakened considerable in
quiry on the part of the residents as to the objects to be
attained thereby. It is a new thing here, and naturally all
sorts of conflicting ideas are entertained concerning the pur
pose of the movement. Coming on the heels of a labor
strike, it is apt to be viewed wrongfully on that account.
Some may think that it has an auti-labor union design.
But this is entirely erroneous. It is not a citizen's alliauce,
as that organization is commonly uuderstood. It has no
special mission in the settlement of disputes between labor
and capital — mine owners and employers. The truth is, it
is nothing more thau an organization of business men and
other citizens who feel disposed to join for mutual benefit
and protection, and to encourage in every possible way the
upbuilding of the city of Jackson and the county of Amador.
We have been dormant in these respects for, 10, these many
years, and to our own detriment: We have indulged in no
boosting; while other communities have engaged in that line
quite extensively, and have reaped the reward in adding to
their population and material wealth. A good deal of our
energy has been expended in fostering petty jealousies, in
backbiting this and that individual on some frivolous ex
cuse, and in most cases those aimed at have been the pro
gressive element of our population, the individuals who haye —
blazed the way in adorning the city or helping in enter
prises tending to increase our population by providing em
ployment to wage-earners.
If rightly conducted the organization will work beneficially
in many ways. Through it several evils the business men
have suffered from- may be corrected. Working together they
can save themselves every year many times over what the
membership dues will cost them. The directions in which
this can be done will readily suggest themselves to those con
cerned. Moreover, it will enable some concerted effort to be
made toward setting forth the advantages of this county as a
desirable place for the homeseeker. Every member should
constitute himself a boosting committee of one in contradis
tinction to the knocking spirit that has heretofore been too
much in evidence." The board of trade, or promotion society,
or whatever name it may be given, is simply a move to get
in line with those progressive communities which have
"reaped and are still reaping substantial benefit from well
directed organizations of this nature. The people of Jackson,
and also Sfesident^inreveryparr'of-the-county, should en
courage the plan. Whatever helps Jackson will more or less
help the county at large. On the other hand, when outlying,
sections are prosperous, the county seat must of necessity
secure a portion of the boom. Let us all get in on the boost
ing plan. We can boost without indulging in any exaggera
tion whatever.
AN APPEAL FOR HISTORICAL MATERIAL.
r
The California State Library/through its California
Department, is making a systematic effort at this time to
gather in material regarding the history of the state. It is
known that large quantities of data such as diaries, manu
script narratives autograph letters of early settlers and
prominent citizens, old ballots, scrapbooks, early account
books, pamphlets, official documents, maps, California
-magazines and newspapers, pictures of pioneers and historic
landmarks, etc., are now in the possession of individuals all
over the state. This material is of very little value to the
possessor, but when incorporated in a collection is of untold
value to the student and writer. The state should be the
custodian of these records. It is therefore asked that all
public spirited citizens, having anything that will throw
light on the history of the state, will donate it to the, state
library, where it will be preserved for all time, and be of
benefit to the general public.
It 'Kindly communicate with the California department,
state library, Sacramento if you know the location of, or have
in yonr possession any of the above mentioned items of
historic interest.
At the city election [in Stockton held last week, the
democrats made a cleau-s weep, electing their entire ticket,
with the exception of two unimportant offices. This result
was brought about by a division of the republican forces on
the liquor issue. The democrats were arrayed against the
closing of saloons on Sunday for resubmission. The
straight republicans favored a resubmission of the question"
to the popular vote. A third party, christened the Good
Government League stood for the continuance of the closing
ordinance. Aud they polled enough to defeat the regular
republicans by 800 plurality, thereby giving the city over
to the control of the anti-reform movement.

—Judge.Amador County
Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises an area of
■548 square miles. It lies on tbo wes
tern slope ot Sierra Nevada nounUlnn,
• and emoraces within itr territory nil
the diversity or valley, foothill, and
high mountainous lands.
Climate.— The climate of tho popu
lous portions of the county is as genial
and healthful as can be found anywhero
ln California. As climato Is one of the
most valuable assets of this favored
" state ln attracting population, Amador
stands second to no county in this re
gard. It should, and no doubt will in
time, when its climatic advantages aro
more thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, become a health resort not
only for those in less favored states,
but for tho residents of other parts of
California. The temperature alone the
central portion rarely falls below 30
degrees abdve zero In winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees in the sum
mer. ' Snow seldom falls In the settled
districts, and nevor remains on the
ground for more than a few hours. Of
coursu, In the high mountain regions
of eastern Amador tho snowfall Is very
lioavy — which is characteristic of the
entire Sierra Nevada range. The sum
mer season is alway accompanied with
cool nights; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs are rare, cy
" clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
infrequent.
-Gold Mining.— The county, although
rich in other sources of wealth, com
paratively untouched, is noted prin
cipally- for her quartz mines. The
deepest gold mines ln America tire lo
cated here. The Kennedy mine Is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
3000 feet below the surface, with every
indication that tho pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold, the county has contrib
uted fully 8100,000000 to the world's
supply of the precious metal. The
mines are still yielding at the rate of
about two million dollars annually.
-Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
■eight or ten mines operating on what
is called the "mother lode," Btretching
•clear across the county in a north-east
erly direction a distance of twenty
•miles. The mines aggregate between
•400 and 500 fitamps, and furnish em
.ploymeat for over 1000 miners. This
•industry is still in its infancy. The
.unexplored territory, even along the
•main gold belt, is far In excess of the
.ground that has actually been worked
or prospected. The county offers to
day one of the most inviting fields to
be found anywhere In the world for the
investment of capital In the fascinating
business of gold mining, not alone along'
the mother lode, but also In the almost
untouched mineralized country ot the
east belt, some ten or twelve miles from
the main lode.
Besides gold, we have copper, de
posits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
■limestone, granite, and soapstone or
talc — all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities.— The agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce anything that can be
grown in the most favored sections.
In the foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all klnds~of
vegetable are raised where Irrigation
ie practicable along the numerous water
•courses. Further up In the mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet, the
soil is admirably adapted for apples
and potatoes. A ready market for
many times the quantity now raised of
these commodities can be found lln the
various mining towns.
Grape culture and wlnemaking are
becoming Important Industries, both
the grapes and wine commanding a
better price than the product of the
lowland.
Landis cheap compared with other
California lands. Improved farms may
be secured for one-fourth the price
current in some places. Unimproved
lands can be bad from $5 to $10 per
acre. It does not require a fortune to
buy a small ranch. There is room for
a large addition to our agnculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts now devoted to
cattle ranges might be made tbe homes
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amador has a population of less than
12000. Three fourths of this is concen
trated in a strip of three miles above
and, below the mineral belt.
Jackson, the county seat, has about
2500 inhabitants, and Is an incorporated
city ot the sixth class: Other towns
me Sutter Creek, Amador City, Dry
town, Plymouth, Volcano, Pine Grove
and Oleta. lone City is the metropolis
of the valley section, a thriving town
of 1000 inhabitants.
Tho community Is law abiding. Edu
cational facilities are excellent. A
school house is within oiwy reach of
nearly every family. There is ono high
school, located at lone.
The assessment roll for 1007 lsss.
800,703, and the tax rato for both state
and county purposes $2 on the 8100.
The Southern Pacific has a branch
railroad running to lone. From this
point the lone and Eastern railroad ex
tends 14 miles further to tbe mining
section.
The various religious denominations
and fraternal organizations aro well
represented.
The power plant of the Standard
Electric Co— one of the largelt In the
world— lslooated four miles from Jack

Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition.
The Alaska-Yukon-Paciflc Exposition- at' Seattle, occupying 250 acres
of the campus of the University of Washington, will result In benefits for
Washington's seat of learning that the University could not have hoped
to secure ln many years, had not the great fair of 1909 been planned. So
the exposition that will exploit Alaska, Hawaii and the Philippines and
emphasize the importance of the growing trade with the Orient will leave,
after Its gates have closed, a large number of permanent structures to'
constantly remind the people of the Northwest of the Alaska-Yukon
. Pacific Exposition and the place it will occupy In the history of the Pacific
as the medium through which one-half of tho world was brought in such
close touch with the other and a tremendous impetus to commercial in
tercourse given.
Seven buildings on the exposition grounds will be left for use of the
University and the auditorium, one of the finest of this group, cost the
State of Washington more than $300,000. While the exposition Is In
progress this building will be used for conventions, congresses and con
ferences, and its hundreds of seats were In place and the building turned
over to the exposition management three months before the opening date
. of the fair.
ORIENTAL PALACE AND MANUFACTURERS BUILDING.
The Palace of Oriental Exhibits and Manufacturers Building have a
frontage on Cascade Court and Geyser Basin and look across at Foreign
Exhibits and Agricultural Palaces; Yukon Avenue separates these mag
nificent display buildings, and in the back ground the state buildings of
Oregon and California are located. . > . .
Construction work on these bulldlrffes was completed last year and
•xhiblts are being received and placed in position. The Oriental Palace
■will house the most valuable collection of Far Eastern art that has ever
been sent from the Orient, and will present displays from Japan. China.
India, Ceylon, Straits Settlements, French Indo China, Borneo, Java and
all the eastern countries of Asia.
The Manufacturers building encloses a vast amount of exhibit space
and every foot of this has been engaged for display purposes by domestic
and foreign manufacturers. The interest manifested in this department of
the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition is world-wide and competitive dis
plays will be general and comprehensive. Exhibits are being dally re
ceived and the heavy work of installation is rapidly being accomplished.
THE END OF THE WORLD
AN ETERNAL PROBLEM.
The terrible cataatropha in Italy
which caused the inhabitants of the
ill-fated city of Messinn to believe
that the end of the world had come is
only a pretaste on a email scale of
what many eminent scientists believe
will be the end of tbe world. The
eternal problem of bow the world will
end ia in the opinion of many a
matter for scientific investigation,
and it is curious that the majority
believe that tbe earth will open up
and fly to pieoea in the most gigantic
earthquake ever kuowu, an earth
quake that will wipe all life from the
globe before tne actual destruction
of the earth ia complete, says Uua
seU's Saturday Journal.
The late Giant Allen ilnnly believ
ed that the wqrld would end by the
crust of the earth eventually giving
way beneath the colossal weight
above it; and Abbe Dupln, one nf the
greatent scientists of France, believes
that doomsday will begin with a war
that will envelope tbo greatest nations
Id Europe, this being followed by a
plague the like of wbiuh has never
been known, culminating with an
earthquake that will praotioally
shake the world to pleoes.
11. U. Wiills, whose scientific pro
phecies are well known, in however,
of a different opinion. The world
will cud, he declares, by its beoom
lug entirely frozen over. It is a well
known fact that every year more 100
accumulatea arouud the poles; in
abort, ruauy millions of tons of Ice
in exoess o( that of the year previous
settle about tb6 earth's extremities
each year, aud in Mr Well'a opinion
tbla will gradually extend until the
whole world ia frozen over aud every

tbing 1b thus destroyed.
Several scientists are of opinion that
we shall perish by fire, and this old
world of ours with us. Nikola Tesla,
the great American, is convinced that
the atmosphere of the world being so
fully charged with eleotrioity, tbe
result will be a gigantio explosion
by spontaneous combustion, when the
world will be entirely enoiicled with
Hamea which In tbe space of a lew
seconds will destroy all life.
Two of tbe world's greatest scient
ists firmly aver that tbe end of tbe
world will be brought about by
astronomiottl conditions. Take Prof.
Marlenberg, tbe noted Austrian
student. In bis opinion tbe earth
will fly from its orbit and come in
contact with one of tbe other planets
that may chance to be in direct line.
"I he earth, being comparatively small,
will of course, get tbe worst of it,
and split into fragments at the colli
sion. Hut, of course, directly tbe
world swerved from tbe orbit all
living things will die, and suub au
earthquake take place as would com
pletely put tbe Italian natastropbe in
tbe shade.
Just uh interesting ia tbe prognosti
cation.of M. Camille Flammariou,
one of the greatest living scientists.
After many years of study he has ar
rived nt the conclusion that tbe
world will in tbe twenty-llttti century
oome across tbe path of tbe comet
Uoilii, which crossed our line a tew
years ago. On this occasion, bow
ever, a collision will take place, and
lieila being infinitely greater than
tbe eartb, a shock may be expected
wbiob, he oaloulatea, will be HtiS
times greater than tbe shook caused
by tbe oollialou betweeu two traluc,
eaob traveling at sixty-five miles au
hour.

LOST CITY EXPLORED.
Details of the first exploration of
tbe lost "City of the Jnoae" by other
than Peruvians were brought to New
York Wednesday by Dr. Hirman
Ltingham, lecturer on Latin-American
history at Yale Univeaity, an author
ity on the history of tbe South
American oontinent. He arrived on
tbe Prince August Wilhelm of tbe
Hamburg-American line's Atlas ser
vice.
Dr. Bingnam, in a trip across
South America, completed only a few
weeks ago, was the tlrst foreigner to
reach Choqquequirau, which until a'
few months ago no man, according
to legend, bad seen in 400 years. His
journey occupied seven months, lie
traveled 1000 miles on mule-back and
made a side trip to Valparaiso, where
be attended tbe first Pan-American
solentißo congress as a representative
of the United States and of Yale.
"The Dame 'Choqquequlrau' means
'cradle of gold." said Dr. Bingham,
"and the legend saye that it was the
plsoe wtmre tbe rulers of the Inoas
hid their treasures when they tied
trom tbe Spaniards in tbe time of
Cortez. They formed a company
down there lust year which waa dig
ging for buried treasure.
"To get there required a week's
hard travel from Cuzoo, the anoieut
capital of the Inoao empire. Most of
tbe time we were hanging on to tbe
side of a mountain almost by our
eyelids. We had to descend into, a
valley 0000 feet deep, cross an other

bridge made of four telegraph wires,
wade through a jungle for sixteen
miles and then olimb up COOO feet.

Have all those who, with loving
hearts, aro engaged in good works,

they are members of the church or

Have any, who attend church regu •

are barsb with the poor, give nothing

Have those got saving faith who

Verses 19, 20 -Is tbere any moral
merit in mere orthodoxy, or is there
any essential moral blame in mere
heterodoxy.
(.ranted a man with the spirit of
Jesus, engaged in good works, what
does he lose by being heterodox, and
what does he gain by being orthodox.
Verses 21-26- When God told Abra

the clerk, ou<:b party answering the
questions us regard age; nativity,
whether married before, nauio ot
futber mother, und other questions.
ibis cvi tuicatu is giv'eu la the Bp*
plioants, aud rtauded to the minister
performing tbe ceremoiiy, und by
him tbe date of performing the
ceremony is filled in and alter sign
ing, is tiled by him witb the county

answered are precisely tbe Bame as
before, only tho duty of tiling in the
answers devolves upon tbe° county

cover the liulmicu of S)IZQ, with in
terest at 7 per cent, aud tor costs.
The answer sets forth that the justice
court had uo jurisdiction to try said
cuuse of action, as the debt whs not
incurred or made payable in the
county of Amudor; thut neither of
the dotoudauts resided in this
county, but have their place of busi
ness and residence in ban Kraucisco;
aud furthermore that the ijluiutiif
for the last live years past has been
3 resident of Hun. l''rnDoi?aO| and has
during that time voted in said city.
Furthermore, the answer alleges that
in May, 1007, plaintiff made a bet
with defendant A. M. Uergeviu, that
a cortaiu wining stock would not by

tain quotation, aud that if said stock
did not reach said quotation vtilue
defendant would forfeit bis check for
$500, whioh was left with a stake
bolder ohosen by the parties to bold
tho Bame iv furtherance of said bet.
The said check was drawn on the
California t?ufe Deposit and Trust
Co., wbiub was then supposed to be
solvent, but before January Ist, 1008,
the bank fulled, and beoame bank
rupt; thut the milling stuck referred
to was uot quoted ut the figure named

DOING THE DOGS.
Marysville Sets an Example Other
Towns Should Follow.
At (he regular weekly meeting, of
the board of trustees of tbe city ot
Mnrysville Monday night, a new
ordloanoe was passed relative to tbe
keeping of dogs In tbat olty. for
merly tbe license on dogii was SI. GO
per year for males and ?2 on females,
with only a small percentage of tbe
owners paying the tax. The result
was tbe same as it is In I'lncnrvilln, a
multiplicity of worthless cure, Tbe
merubauts of Marysville and their
patrons united in a demand tbat
existing conditions be remedied, aud
tbat tbe number of dogs banging
around tbe businoss part of town be
greatly reduced* The new law for
bids the running at large or any
canines in certain presonbed bual
neas limits of tbe city. Tbo license
ia raised, being 87.50 on female and
83 on male* dogs per annum, and tbe
penalty to recover unregistered dogs
is 83 and 81 respectively. To save
bis dog from tbe poundmaster in
tbe restricted district the owner
mast keep him tied up, and go out
with him in leash when tbe dog is
on tbe street. Tbe trustees of Plaoer
ville would relieve tbe . business por
tion of thin oil? of. a. disgusting
nuisance by adopting and euforoing
a similar ordinanoe, aud tbe green
grooers aud tbeir customers would
have oooasion to rejoice* and be
thankful.— Kepublicau.

In Blackstone's Time.
Those pessimists wno bolleve iv tbe
retrogression of tbe world should
study the laws of the past centuries.
Man is at least more merciful now
than then, and probably better iv
other particulars. When tbe much
quoted Blackstone was tabulating
English laws iv 17«\ there was ICO
offence's punishable by deatb. These
included such misdeeds as growing
tohaooo, cutting trees, stealing
linen put out to dry, etc. A patti
oularly fierce deatb was planned for
tbe person guilty of high treason.
Tbe law oondemmod tbe traitor to be
out down when balf banged, to be
dlsembowled and have bis intestines
burned before bis face. And bistory
records tbat these fierce laws were
frequently enforced. It was to evade
such unjust laws tbat judges and
lawyers invented tbe technicality
and long delay, but tbeir use, un
fortunately, didn't pass when laws
were shaped along tbe lines of jus
tice.— Atchison Globe.

Like other moderu occupations,
wiroliißs telegraphy has brought
epeainl disorders to mini. In the
campaign Id Morocco, the wlrolcus
telegraph operators of tho "Ues
catoa" of the t'rencb Navy have been
pretty steadily employed, and Dr.
I*. liellile, the surgeon on board ic
ports that tho llertzlau waves, have
developed various maladier among
these men. The eyes were much
affected, oases of slight conjuncti
vitis, keratitis and leukoraa being
common. Ibis was due to the very
powerful iicit.ion of the ultra violet
rays, and the weariDg of yellow or
orange glasses was advised. Another
ailment set up was eczema, of which
there were two cases— one of the
wrist and one of the eyelid— both
difficult to oace. A particularly un
comfortable case was that of an
official who bad worked the wireless
telegraph several years, but wbo
suffered from painful palpitation of
the heart after using the sending in
struments for any considerable time.
Dr. Uollilo is inclined to attribute
also to wireless telegraphy much of
the nervous derangements now be
oomiug rather common among naval
meu.
The making of ice goblets,, which
cool beverages as they are served,
has been so perfected by 11. D. V.
tiuizor, at his snmtner resort factory
near The llßgue, that 100 per hour
can be made with one horse-power,
only a small refrigerating maobiue
being needed to supply the cold
brine. The mold is of special metal,
with a core of porcelain, and - after
pouriug in the water the whole is
submerged in the brine at 40 degrees
below zero for six minutes, then
passed fora moment to a special
heater, when the goblet is pushed out
and caught in a paper holder. Kaon
goblet contains half a pint. it can
be filled only ouce, but will hold the
beverage half an hour in hot weather.
Every metal is believed by Urutin,
a (Jermau ohoniist, to have its
peculiar odor, which be regards as a
gaseous Transformation produot. He
has made some of the odois percep
tible for. a few moments at intervals
by heating tho metalß to 122 degrees
I'ahr. «•
Cork tissue, or "tissue-liege, 1 '
the novel waterproof fabric now be
ing made in Franco, is ordinary clotb
with a lining ot cork ouly 1-250 of an
inch thick, and -is a substitute for
rubber cloth that is clainibd to be
free from most of the defects of that
material, liefore being sliced into
tli lii luyers, the cork is treed from
its resinous matter, thus beomiug
very flexible. Tho thin sheets are
then pressed into the outer cloth,
forming a perfect lining for cotton,
wool, silk, ramie, felt or leather and
the resin-freeing treatment has made
the cork so pliant that it may be
folded without breaking. The outer
cloth op other material is unchanged
in appearance. A garment from the
cork-lined fabric is soft and comfor
table is perfectly proof against water,
does not deteriorate like rubber clotb,
is very light, and bas no odor. When
desired, another lining— of cloth—
may be used to cover tho cork layer.

The eaitb'a ntmosphf^e varies greatly
i'u olonruoae, bud, while American
astronomers havo established several
observatories in very favorable locali
ties, it appears that just the best
spot for a great international obser
vatory-where the world's supremo
effort at looking outward ouu be
made— bas not yet beuu determined.
A study is now being begun of the
oonditious in the Karrooß, or elevated
plums of Mouth Africa, near the
scenes of the Uoer war. At a number
of stations estimates of cloudiness
will be iniulu ou a uniform, sculc,
steadiness of the nir will be adjudged
by such ohcervations as those of
double stars, aud photographic tents
will be made by star trails. These
sensitive methods ate expected to
show whether the air is better for
feeing tlmu that of other places
known.
Kor tint best tiHuty on the earth's
interior, the University of Jena hag
awarded a prize lo M. Tuieue, whose
theory is thus outlined: 'The uieuu

The now German method of light
ing lire In light liquidß, like benzine
or gnsollun, consists in covering the
surtaoe with n luyer of fonm contain
ina an inert, gas, thus cutting oil the
nir mid making combustion impos
sible. The approved apparatus mado
by n Prussian company uonr MnMoii,
as described by Consul T. 11. Nor*
ton, consists, of n sitnplo nmtnl
cyliudor, divided into two chambers,
and provided with a long spout. One
chamber Is charged with an aqueous
solution of potnsli alum aud sodium
sulphate; the other, with a solution
of sodium bicarbonate, sodium sul
phate, unil licorice root extract. As
the two oylinders are iuclined or re
versed, the two solutions mix as they
Issue from tbo spout, and the chem
ical reaction between the alum and
bicarbonate gives a prompt evolution
of curon dioxide, converting the
licoriue solution into an exceedingly
stilt and persistent foam. Even when
the burning liquid bas become so hot
that its llory vapor bubbles up
through the fomn, the carbon dioxide
rapidly cools it. Ina test by the
Hanover llro department, 18 gallons
of benzine— partly in a shallow iron
pan and partly scattered on the
ground — was allowed to burn three
minutes, and then received tho con
tents of two foam extinguishers,
which quickly arrested the Ore.
When the foam was removed and fire
relighted, water from a 2-inch hose
was insufficient to cheok tbo flames,
whiob spread rapidly endangering
near-by buildings.
Bees return to their hives in a
direct line when they have been
carried away and liberated, up to two
miles. This has beeu supposed to be
due either tn the sense of sight or of
smell, but the experiments of Gaston
JJnunlnr havo proven that neither
sight nor smell can serve the purpose,
and that bees have a special "sense
of direction." Ibis sense is not in
the antennae.
A novel luxury for the hotel bed
chambers is a new signal apparatus
that gives the exact time at any
minute. A small telephone receiver
is placed near the bead of the bed or
even under the pillow, and piessing
a button causea.a set of gongs to
strike, announcing through the tele
puone.tbe- hour, quorter,-and number 1
ot minutes past the quarter.

"LO" AT THE PHONE.
Any of Hit Tribesmen Will Do t«
Answer His Call.
The liulimiH are great on using the
telephone. They have but little or no
use for the local boards, their rails
being over the long distance, They
do not put In a call for the Individual.
They do not nsk for While Eagifl nt
Cnrilrm or Plying Cloud nt Darlington.
The call Is for "any Cheyenne." The
same Is I rue us to the Arnpalioea.
Any member of the tribe serves.
An Indian puts In n call for any
member of his tribe nt Canton, Dnr
lington, Colony, Lnwton or any point.
It U "up to" the manager to so out on
the street and pick up nn Indian. Any
one will do, so he Is of the tribe asked
for. lie Is put up to the phone and
the tn lit proceeds. Tho fnlk being In
Imlliin, no one knows what It Is about.
If an Indian, say. In Clinton wnnts
to reach one of his people, say, forty
miles from Canton or any other given
point, he calls for one of his tribes
men, tells him tho message lie desires
delivered, and It Is his business to do
llvor It, even though It requires a
uitfht trip and In n storm.
A little Indian baby died near Clin
ton lust yenr, and bis mother desired
that her relatives attend the funeral
services. They lived out on the prairie
northwest of Canton. The telephone
was used and. a member of the tribe
directed to deliver the message to the
mother's relatives. It was delivered
by n courier across the prairies and
canyons, and the relatives came in
over tho Orient next day.
Last summer a call came to Clinton
for a Klowa that wns a poser for the
manager. However, he found upon
Inquiry nmoug the Chcyenncs that
there was one who had lived among
the Kiowas and spoke the dialect. lie
was put up to the phone and received
the call.— Clinton Cor. Dallas News.
Seedless Grapes.
What's become of the "coroless" ap
ple? Twenty years ago It was an
nounced as a discovery or a develop
ment calculated to revolutionize the
orchard industry. Of late we hear
less about It. A little later the "thorn
less" blackberry appeared on the hori
zon. It certainly was thornlcss, but
somehow it failed to drive the fero
ciously armed brambles of the berry
gardens Into the desert. It Is still
produced, but the older kinds are yet
mucli more common. Now the "seed
less" grape bids for favor. Siieli a
fruit would surely "meet a long felt
waul." If the quality and flavor of
the few thus far grown can be per
petuated and It- proves remuneratively
productive and capable of "standing
up" for shipment there Is a big future
before it.— Country Life In America.
Camilla Flammarion's Home.
~ M. Flainmarion, with his wife, who,
jj^tbjejivay, is also a Ueen thinker and
her husband's constant assistant, lives
In a chateau at Juvlsy, built rijjht on
the spot chosen by Louis XIII. to
erect a royal residence. Besides be
ing an admirable housewife, Mine.
Flammarlon Is one of the charter
members of the Disarmament league.
Before Louis XIII. cast his eyes on
the place there wns n chateau there.
Napoleon stayed in it on his wny to
Fontalnebleau. The mansion was ac
quired. later by an amateur astrono
mer,- who had an observatory con
structed on the grounds. When he
died he bequeathed the entire proper
ty to a man whom lie had never seen.
This man wns Catnille I'laminarion.—

To Stop Hiccoughs.
Dr. Louis KollpinsUl reports tho nr
rcst of persistent hiccough by depress
ing the tongue.. A patient was attack
ed by hiccough which had persisted
for four days before being seen by the
doctor. lie complained of he fullness
in his throat, a condition which he
thought the result of the hiccough.
He' was directed to sit up, and with v
large spoon handle the tongue was
pressed down and back with steady
force to allow inspection of the fauces.
Firm pressure on the tongue witli the
hope of further noting the action of!
thP pnlntal muscles was continued,
when, to the doctor's surprise and the
patient's astonishment and joy, the
hiccough ceased. When the hiccough
returned the patient himself stopped
it by using the spoon handle.— London

The Flat Wheel.
The enormous energy developed by
a flat spot In a wheel bus been esti
mated by Professor Hancock of Pur
due university. He finds that a flat
spot two and one-half Inches lonpt on
a thirty-three Inch wheel, carrying a
load of 0,000 pounds at thirty miles
per hour, will deliver n blow to tho
rail of more than 1,000 foot pounds.
The same flat wheel supporting a fifty
five ton lutorurbnn car running sixty
miles .per "hour would deliver a blow
with an energy of 9,500 foot pounds.
Such a flat spot would be produced by
wearing off less thnu five one-huu
dredtus of nn lucu of metal.—Scien
tific American.
Tho Atmosphere of Mart.
Professor Perelval Lowell, the as
tronomer, suys t lint the assistants at
his observatory at FliiKsttin". Ariz.,
have lioen able to determine tlmt there
U measurable water vapor on tho
planet Mars and that the atmosphere
of Mars affects the spectrum In tho
Bnme way, though only one-fifth ns
Uiueh, ns docs tho earth's atmosphere.
There has been much controversy
with refereuee to tho atmosphere of
Mars and Its <iuulltles. Those selen
11:1s who disbelieve in any life on the
1>! uii-t have known that their point
co-jM be proved if the absence of an
atmosphere should be tshowa.

The House Fly.
Editor Ledger:— We bear a great
deal about the bouse fly, about its
uautiness, bow it crawls over all
kinds of filth and never wipes its
feet, and then gets into your tea or
ooffee, or into tbe milk pitcher, or
crawla over your bread, etc, and
thereby breeda disease, which no
doubt is all true enough. And if
true, why not get a move on and ex
terminate them, and save the lives of
thousands every year. Let the govern:
tnent otfer a reward of lifty or a
hundred thousand dollars tor an
exterminator, something that will
draw them a long distance and kill
them tbe instant tbat they set tbeir
dirty feet on it, and have fly killing
stations every few miles or at every
bouse if nsed be, and compel people
to use It, and in every block fn tbo
city. And when they are all exter
minated quarantine every ship that
lands on our shores, until they have
not a fly on board. If ye succeed all
the nations of tbe eartb will follow
suit, and the world will be rid ot its
greatest pest, except tbe liquor
traffic. The plan is feasible. Tbe
United States and individual states
have given premiums for objects less
worthy, ! Tbo state of New York
offered one bundred thousand dollars
for a water wheel tbat would' run a
canal boat without washing the banks
of Ihe canal. J. F. Uregg.

THE TWO HORSE BRAND || \
DEFAULTER OF OVER $6000
Cltas. 11. Turner, Grand Secretary
of N. S. G. W.,' Short to That Ex
tent.
Chns. 11. Turner, graud Bearetnry
of JNutive sons, tins been fonnd ebort
in bis account lo the liuin of over
?(i(MH). An expert examination of bis
books fliovva this defalcation during
tlm iinst year. It Is supposed tbat
the beginning of th.a leakage dates
further baok. Ho has held tbe olllco
nf graud treasurer for six yours and
was n candidate for reelection before
the lost grand purlor which wns bold
In Maryßvillo last mouUi. Charges
were preferred agaiust him at Unit
time. Nothing definite was dovelop
ed, but a certain suspicions entry in
bis accounts led to the belief tbat
something was wrong. When bis
successor Fred U. Juug, was elected,
an expert examination was started,
and soon disclosed tbat a systom of
embezzlement bad linen going on, tbe
leakage beiug 86000 during tbe one
year. lurner passed his early years
in Jackson. Here be was schooled
and lived during the years of bis
minority. . Here he was married.
Many years ago tbe family removed
to San Francisco, where be has most-
Iv resided over since. His wife ia a
sister of A. Cnmiuetti of this county.
Hia friends nud Tolativcs keenly feel
the blow resulting from bis dishonest
actions. - The Call of tbo 26th says of
this attair:
The discovery was made yesterday
by grand trustee Liouis li. Mooser
and an expert accountant delegated
by tbe grand parlor to examine '.tur
ner's books. Tbe National surety
company, which was on Turner's
bonds during bis inoumbency, was
notified of tbe defalcations yesterday,
and today criminal proceedings will
be taken against the former official.
Irregularities were discovered" in
Tinner's books during the week prior
to the meeting ot tbe grand parlor' at
Marysville, but the dlsoovery waa not
complete and as it then appeared
from a cursory examination of the
books that Turner bad made good bis
peculation tbe grand officers com
promised with tbe man, telling him
tbat if be would not run for re-elec
tion bis conduct would not he
exposed.
After tbe grand parlor bas adjourn
ed a more extensive examination was
made of Turner's books, with tbe
result tbat it was found that be bad
misappropriated more than 30,000
during the last year. Of 'this sum
83,400 waa taken from tbe per capita
tax fund of tbe order and tbe balance
from returns on supplies sold by tbe
grand parlor to tbe subordinate par
lors.
Jt is said tbat Turner bas admitted
liia thefts to tbe otHoers of tbe grand
parlor, explaining tbat be bad no
system of stealing, "but tbat be took
tbe money when be needed it."
' Turner shortly betore bad changed
the system of booking in the oflloe.
A new sot of books had been started
and arbitrary balancea established.
On Friday, April 23, there was a
meeting nf tbe grand officers held in
tbo local headquarters of tbe order in
tlio Uelbert bunding, Van Ness
areuue and U'Farrell street.
Tbe grand officers asked Mooser at
tbat time tor bis report ou tbe
finances of the order. Mooser replied
tbat tie could not aooept the books as
tboy stood, owing to tbe recent
change in bookkeeping. lie added
tbat in tbe books aa they stood be
bad found that during tbe months of
April and May, 1008, Turner bad
turned in 11,000, wbiob was not
charged to any fund. Tbat seemed a
susplolous entry.
Turner admitted, it is stated, tbat
be bad borrowed 31,000 from tbo
funds of tbe order aud had paid the
sum buck in tbat crude aud unwieldy
way.
Immediately, when tbat breaob of
faith was made known, tbe grand
ouioera ordered tbe resignation of tbe
graud secretary. Turner arose from
bis seat as if to comply with tbe re
quest aud started toward bis desk.
But aa be ueared tbe door be drew a
revolver from hia pooket aud deolar
ud tbat be might as well die as be
disgraced. Thou he dodged out of
tbe door and into the lavatory of the
building.
