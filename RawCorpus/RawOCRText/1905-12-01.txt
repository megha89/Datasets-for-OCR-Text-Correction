"Whereas, the present welfare ot
the manufacturers, producers, whole
salers and jobbers of the. Pacific
coast and the future growth and
development of their various and

largley upon a system of rate-making

which the terminal rate to which the
jobbing and . manufacturing cities ol

of water competition is recognized,

"Whereas, the assistance rendered
the manufacturers, wholesalers and

JACKSON, AMADOU COUNTY.^ALIFOEKTA, FRIDAY. DECEMBER 1, 1905.
AN ATTACK BY PIRATES.
By Maud Anderson.
We wore a week's journey from
Curacon. I was sitting alone in my
cabin when the captain came down
and told me there was a vessel just
appearing on the horizon to wind
ward, and asked me to go and see
what she was, for he could not make
her oat at all. I went on deck
mounted into the maintop, and began
my scrutiny.
"Well, what is she?" asked the
captain fiom the deck.
"1 can hardly make her out, but
1 think she's a schooner."
"What's her course"
"Sou-west by south, I think; about
the same as ours." I remained on the
top for a few minutes, and continued
looking at the stranger. "She seems
tonder of 'he sea than I am," i con
tinued, "for she might have her top
sails and top gallants, and studding
sails to boot, all set, instead of slipp
ing along under her lower sails."
The captain made no answer, but
was looking hard at her with his
naked eye. 1 now perceived through'
my glass a white speck above her fore
sail, flapping against the mast.
"Well," I said, "she must have
heard me, for there goes her foretop
sail."
- The captain now went to the com
panion for his glass,' and after look
ing attentively at her for a short
time, "What's that, 1 ; he asked. "Is
that her square sail she's setting? 1
can't very well see from the deck."
I looked again. "¥es, 'tis her
square sail. As I'm alive, she's
changed her course, and is bearing
down upon us!" But by this time
the captain had mounted the rigging,
and was standing beside me; he was
eyeing the distant vessel keenly.
After having apparently satisfied
himself, he asked me to go with him
to the cabin, as he wished to talk
with me alone. We descended to
the deck,' and 1 followed him to the
cabin. He motioned me to take a
seat, and after carefully shutting the
door— ■■
"1 rather expect," said he, "that
fellow's a pirate."
"Pirate," I cried in alarm.
"V'es, 1 say pirate, and I'll tell you
why. In the first place, you see, he'd
no business to be sneaking along in
that do little sort of way, as when
we tirst saw him. Whoever, that had
any honest business to do, would
allow such a line breeze to go by
without showing more canvas than
a powder monkey's old breeches to
catch it? Next, ! you see, what the
mischief has* he to do with us, that
as soon as he's clapped eyes on us,
he must alter his course, and be so
anxious to get out his square sails?
Again, he looks just like one ot those
imps of mischief, with his low black
hull and tall raking masts. . No' use
talking; the only thing is, what shall
we do? The Patrick Henry ain't a
Baltimore clipper, _ and that 'ere
blackguard will just walk up to' us
like nothing. It we let 'em aboard,
it's most likely we'll all walk the
plank, so we'd better try to keep 'em
out. We've only got an old rusty
carronade and two six-pounders, and
1 don't believe there's a ball on
board, we came off in such a hurry.
There's two muskets and an old re
gulation rifle down in the state-room,
but they ain't been Hied ■ I don't
know when, and I'd as lief stand afore
'em as behind 'em. But our snip's as
handsome a looking craft as you'll
see; and couldn't we look wicked-like
now, and try to frighten that cut
throat rascal?"
1 confess I was at first staitied at
the captain's opinion of the strange
sail; but his cool and collected mann
er impressed me with confidence
iv his management, and 1 told him
that he knew best what we should do,
and 1 would second him as well as 1
could. He walked up and down the
cabin twice; then rubbing his hands
together, as it pleased with bis own
idea — •'. ■':
"1 have it," he cried; "I'll just go
on deck to put things in: order, and
in the meantime you'd' better amuse
yourself looking out your pistols, if
you have any; for it he wun't be con
tent with a look at us, we'll have to
fight." 1 hurriedly took my fowling
pieces and pistols from their cases,
for 1 fortunately had both; and
though 1 somehow refused to allow
myself to believe there would beany
occasion for their use, yet 1 loaded
them with ball, and in each . of the
pistols put a brace. This done, 1
went -on deck, where I found .the
captain surrounded by his crew, tell
ing them his suspicions and plan of
action. 'f?:%
"Maybe," said he, "wo'll have to
fight. If them scoundrels have a
mind to try us they'll send a boat
on board, and I want to know if
you'll help me to keep them oil.
You see, it's most likely they'll make
you walk the plank whether you fight
or not, if they get on board ; and 1
calculate, if you do just as I tell you,
we'll frighten 'em."
There was a hearty "Ay, ay, sir!"
to this short and pithy harangue.
"Thankee, thankee, boys," said the
oaptam. "Now, we'll show another
stitch of oanvas, but just seem to take
no more notice of that fellow, than
if we didn't see him; if he does try
to come aboard, then we'll show 'em
what we can do."
The crew were soon busy, in obedi
ence to bis orders, cutting up spare
foretop gallant-masts into logs ot
about four feet long. These were
immediately puintnd black, with a
round spot in the center of ' one end
so as to bear a tolerable resemblance
to pieceß of caiman, and with the two
old six-pounders, were placed one
at each port on our deck, five on a
side ; but the ports were to"; be j kept
closed until the captain ■> gave, the
order to raise them, when they: weie
to be opened as quickly as, possible,
and the logs thrust out nbout'a loot.
A platform was then madej^i&n. the
top of the long-boat, which was fixed
between the fore and main-; masts,
and the carronade, or fourteen
pounder, was hoisted up. \ ' These
things being arranged, the captain
went below, and the crew mustered
in knots to wonder and talk of what
was to be done. . ;ix
In the meantime we had been stand
ing on our course, and had not shift
ed or hoisted a single sail, but were
as if perfectly regardless of the
schooner. Not so with her, however;
for besides a large square sail and
square topsail on the foremast, she
had run out small fore-topmast studd
ing sails, and onward she came before
a pretty smart breese, yawing from
side to side, at one moment sinking
stern foremost in the trough of the
sea, as an enormous wave rolled out
from under her, and at the next forced
headlong upwards by its successor,
while a broad white -sheet of foam
spread out around her, giving beauti
ful relief to the jet-black color of her
bull, testifying how rapidly she was
going through the water. 1 could
not help thinking of the' captain's
expression, for she certainly did
"walk up to us like nothing;" and as
there appeared not much time to lose,
I went down to the. cabin to assume
my weapons. The captain was there
arranging some papers, and a bottle
was before him, into which he had
put a letter.
"Maybe," said he, "something'll
happen to me; tor if them 'ere blood
thirsty wretches won't- be cheated 1
shall be the first to suffer; .and
natural enough too, for all the mis
chief they'll suffer will be by my
orders, just because l didn't like to
be overhauled like an old tarpaulin
by every rascal that chooses to say
"Heave too n the high seas. But
nevermind, only should you escape,
just drop the bottle and letter over
board, if you think you can't deliver
it yourself."
1 had never seriously considered
the probability that 1 might also be
killed in an approaching light, for 1
thought that the captain intended to
throw open his ports and ■ show his
sham guns that the schooner would
take fright. But when he began to
talk about aeath in such a serious
strain, 1 began to feel very uncom
fortable; and not being naturally a
warrior, 1 "wished myself anywhere
else than on board the Patrick Henry.
There I was, however, without a
chance of escape; and I j suggested to
the captain that it , would be as well
for me to put a letter- into the bottle
also, in case of any accident to 'both
of us, which was agreed to; and we
arranged that if either survived, and
had opportunity, the letter of the un
fortunate should be safely forwarded
to its destination. After this little
piece of preparation the captain took
me by the hand and said :
"That's well. Are you willing to
share the post of danger with me?
Don't suppose that I'm unaccustom
ed to the dangers ol a sea light. No;
I 'ye supported the glory of my coun
tiy iv some gallant actions, and have
seen men killed who have since been
honored and esteemed as the sons of
liberty.. Yoii are a . padsenger and
should be under my protection, yet 1
ask you to share the danger. X want
somebody to stand by me on the plat
form, and help me to manage the
swivel. Hands are scarce, and I don't
know where else to place you."

mark of Scott's Emulsion,
and is the synonym for
strength and purity. It is sold
in almost all the civilized coun-
tries of the globe.
If the cod fish became extinct
it would be a world-wide calam-
ity, because the oil that comes
from its liver surpasses all other
fats in nourishing and life-giving
properties. Thirty years ago
the proprietors of Scott's Emul-
sion found a way of preparing
cod liver oil so that everyone can
take it and get the full value of
the oil without the objectionable
taste. Scott's Emulsion is the
best thing in the world for Aveak,
backward children, thin, delicate
people, and all conditions of
wasting and lost strength.

The hardy fellow's eyes glistened as
he made the proposal, to which i in
stantiy. agreed. We wnnt • on' deck,
and the men were still hanging about,
waiting for orders. These were soon
given. The cooper and the carpenter
were ordered to bring up all hatchets
and the other offensive and defensive
weapons, and, with the muskets and
rifles, these were distributed among
the crew, who were told to use them
in repelling any attempt to board.
' The schooner had now come down
within half a mile of us, when she
suddenly took down her square sail,
and hauled her wind to have a look
at us.' I dare say she ' did not know
what to make of our seeming indiffer
ence. Presently a cloud of smoke
burst from her side, and a ball came
skipping over the ..water and passed
astern of us. • *•■-
t VI thought "so, ",said- the captain.
'.'Now, lada, show our stripes I" '."•'.■
A ball of bunting Hew up to the
end of our mizzen peak, rested an
instant and fluttered out the Ameri
can ensign. The smoke drifted away
from the schooner, and she ran up at
her gaff the ensign of the Colombian
Republic.
"That's, just the way with them
blackguards," said the captain; "they
are always making a fool of some
republic."
Scarcely were the words out of his
mouth when another column of smoke
burat from the schooner, and another
ball came skipping along towards us,
but, catching a swell, it plunged in,
and we saw no more of it.
"That fellow, now, JL take it is a
good shot, so we'll not 'wait for
another. Clew up the - mainsail,
boys; haul aft the main braces; clew
up the foresail ; luff her, man, lufi
her a little more— steady !" burst
from our captain's mouth. The
orders were obeyed with the quick
ness of a well disciplined crew, and
our ship was hove to.
. "Now, my lads, take your ftations
as directed, four to each port, on the
weather side, but do nothing till I
tell ye."
i'he men took their stations as di
rected by each log. on the weather
side, and 1 followed the captain to
the platform where our carronade was
moated. It was loaded to the muzzle
with bits of iron, musket-balls, lumps
of lead, and various other missiles,
for the captain Bad conjectured truly
—there were no balls on board. The
schooner hove-to, and a boat was
lowered and crowded with men. It
approached rapidly, pulled by' eight
rowers. The muzzle of our carronade
was depressed as much as possible,
and made to bear on the water about
fifty yards from the ship.' The cap
tain stood with his speaking trumpet
in one band and a hand spike, | with
which he shifted the position of the
gun as required, in the other. The
scnooner'B boat approached and was
pulling rapidly to get alongside.
"Now, sir, keep steady, and obey
my orders coolly," said the captain
in an undertone. • "Boy, fetch the
iron that's heating in the galley
run!"
The boy ran, and returned with the
iron rod heated ' at one end, which
was handed to me.
"When I tell you to fire— fire, as
you value your life' and those on
board 1"
The captain now put his speaking
trumpet to his mouth and hailed the
boat, which was within a hundred
yards of us.
"Stop! No nearer, or I'll blow you
all out of the water. Keep off— keep
off, or I say I'll—"
At that instant the man at the bow
of the boat : who appeared to take
the command, gave an order, and a
volley from several muskets was tired
at us. 1 heard the balls hit about
me, and turned to look tor the cap
tain, to receive my< order to fire. He
was on one knee behind the cannon,
and holding it by the breech.
"Why, captain. What's the matter?
Are you hitr'V ;-.'■-
He rallied. Nothing— they're com
ing!" He gave another hoist to the
gun, cast his eye hurriedly along its
barrel.
"Fire, ana be quick!"
I needed not a second bidding, for
the boat was close alongside. The
smoke burst from the touch-hole with
a hiss, and for the instant I thought
the gun had missed fire; but the
next it exploded with a tremendous
report that deafened me.
"Throw open your ports, boys, and
show them your teeth!" roared- the
oaptain through his trumpet, and his
voice seemed hideously unnatural.
In an instant every port was up,
and our guns protruded their muzzles.
I bad fancied that I heard . a crash,
followed by wild screams, immediate
ly upon the discharge ofjtbe cannon;
but the report had deafened me, and
the smoke, which 'was driven back in
my face, had so shrouded - me that 1
could not see.. The unearthly shout
of the captain had also for the mo
ment driven the idea from my mind,
and 1 now grasped the gun to repel
boarders.
' But my hearing had not deceived
me, for as the smoke was borne away
to leeward, the whole scene ot
destruction burst upon my sight.
The canngn bad been * most truly
pointed, and its contents had shiver
ed the hapless boat, killing or wound
ing almost every person in her.
The longest lifetime will hardly
efface that scene from my mina. The
stern of the boat had been carried
completely away, and it was ' sinking
by the weight of the human beings
that clung to it. As it gradually dis
appeared, the miserable wretches
struggled forward to the bows and
with horrid screams and imprecations
battled for what little support it
might yield. The dead and the dying
were floating and splashing tiround

them, while a deep crimson tingo
showed how fatal had been that dis
cbarge. - Hopes were thrown over,
and everything done to save those
who were not destroyed by the
oannon-sbot, but only . throe : out of
the. boat's crew of twenty-four were
saved;, the. greater number went
down with tue boat, .to which they
clung.
The whole scene of devastation- did
not last ten. minutes, and all was
again quiet. The bodies of those who
had been shot did not sink, but were
driven by the wind and sea against
the side of the ship. I<'rom some the
blood was gently oozing and floating
around them; . others, stiff in the
convulsion in which they had died,
were grinning or frowning with
horrible expression. One body,
strong and muscular, with neat white
trousers, and a leather girdle ° in
which were stuck two pistols, floated
by, but the face was gone ; sbmo
merciless ball had so disfigured him
that all trace of human expression
was destroyed. Ho was the pirate
But whore was the schooner? She
lay to for a few minutes after the
destruction of her boat, and whether
alarmed at .our appearance, or horri
fied at the loss of so many of her men,
I know not, but she slipped her fore
sail and stood away as close to the
wind as possible.. We saw no more of
her.
The excitement of the scenes -we
bad just passed through prevented
our missing the captain; but as soon
as the schooner bore away, all nat
urally expected his voice to give
some order for getting under weigh.
But no order came. Where was he?
The musket discharge from the boat,
with the unearthly voice that con
veyed the orders for the ports to be
opened, flashed across my mind. I
ran to the platform. The captain
was there, lying on his face beside
the gun that he bad pointed with such
deadly effect. He" still grasped the
speaking-trumpet in Ms band, and 1
shuddered .as I beheld the mouth
piece covered with, blood.
"The captain's killed!" 1 cried,
and stooped to raise him.
"I believe 1 am," said he; "take
me to the cabin." . f
A dozen ready hands weie stretched
to receive him, and he was taken be
low and carefully laid on the sofa.
. "Ay." he said, "1 heard the crash;
my ear knows too well the crash of
shot against a plank to be mistaken,
and my eye has pointer! too many
guns to miss its mark easily now.
But tell me, is anyone else hurt?"
.".No, thank God," I said, "and I
hope you are not so badly hit."
"Bad enough. But cut open my

there was a small wound. A musket

fatal wound was within. The un

incorporation Election.
Next Tuesday the citizens of Jack
son will be called upon to decide by
their ballots whether Jackson shall
be incorporated as city of the sixth
class, or remain unincorporated aa at
present. The issue is one of vital
- importance especially to those having
property interests in the town. To
these it appeals with great force, as
(he; aie the oues who will be attecle i
iiy t!i« decision. It is nonsense to
couiuuil that -those whose all of
worldly goods is concentrated within
the limits of. the proposed city aro
less interested in the future prosper
ity of tne town, than those who are
not so situated. Such a proposition
is not worth discussing. The only
question with property holders is,
whether the welfare of Jacksun will
be promoted by along
the lines proposed in the call of an
election, or whether incorporation
will exert an adverse influence upon
the town. This, is the only point
that will be considered by those hav
ing material interests here. Other
considerations will no doubt move
others to vote one way or the' othei,
but self interest will in this, as other
human affairs be paramount with
those who have interests depending
upon the issue. Those who believe
incorporation will improve the town
will cast their vote for "it. Those
would believe it will prove a burden
too heavy to be borne, will vote
against it. '
It is estimated that the taxable
property within the proposed city,
according to the assessment of the
county assessor, will foot up about
5000,000. Kookouing the tax rate at
the maximum limit of 75 cents on the
$100— and we venture the opinion that
if carried on the proposed lines, it
will never fall below that rate— we
have §4500 as the income from direct
property taxes. It must be remem
bered that there is no fixity in the
present 'valuation of property. By
this we mean, that the city assessor
will not be bound by the 'figures of
the county assessor, lie can boost
the assessment arbitrarily if he so
pleases. And bis policy on this point
would be governed solely by the de
mands of the muncipality for running
expenses. If the revenue from the
present valuation proves unequal to
the demands, a stuffing of the assess
ment roll would be the first remedy
resorted to. Next to the property
tax, license' tax would be the next
heavy source of income tor the sup
port of the city administration. This
tax, based on the present county
schedule, would yield about §3000 per
year. Line the assessment value,
however, the license schedule is
liable to change, to meet require
ments. It is far more likely to be
increased than to deoreased, and
many businesses now free from license
imposition, would no doubt be called
upon to furnish revenue. The road
poll tax would perhaps yield 81000 per
annum. ■ Here we have a total of
88500. With this we would have to
meet all the expenses of the city
organization. To many it will seem
at first blush a pretty fair income,
and it the city lines were drawn com
pactly with a desire to economize in
operating expenses, it might be
•adequate, without the aid of the stuff
ing policy, to pay actual running ex
pense, and leave a small margin— and
a very small margin per year is the
utmost, that the conservative friends
of incorporation could reasonably
expect — for permanent improvements.
As the city is laid out, however, we
cannot see that one dollar would be
-'left for permanent improvements
such as sewers and street making.
The running expenses would swallow
everything in sight. And in this
opinion, we assume tha.t the local
government will be administered
honestly and economically. We do
not take the possibility ot graft into
consideration.
It is not difficult to figure out the
proposition. As a rule the cost of
government per capital varies with
population and territory. A com
pact territory will take less for
government than a widely extended
territory, with the same population.
The state ' government costs over 85
per head; our county government
oosts nearly 810 per head. In the
case of the Jackson municipality the
cost of education would be cut out.
This is admittedly a large item, ot
expense. But with this eliminated,
154 per head is a low estimate of cost
for a government worthy of the name.
That would mean $10,000 per year.
Now let us particularize a little.

That portion ot the proposed city |
that now falls within the present
townsitc, and strictly residence
districts includes seven miles of
streets actually platted and surveyed.
Irue some are not built on, and might '
not be a charge upon the city for \
several years. . Say six miles of
streets to be looked after. In ad
dition to this striotly street mileage,
we have from four to five miles of
county roadway thrown in by way of
ballast. Altogether streets and roads '
would reach about ten miles. Now,
the patchwork business pursued by
the county on our
county roads costs on an average fin
this supervisor district over §100 per
mile every year. Such a meager sum
would be completely lost sight of on
our streets. It would have to be
concentrated upon a mile or less to
make any showing at all. Then
sprinkling must be provided, and this
is where the inadvisability of dragg
ing in the essentially country roads
comes in. Lighting must be provid
ed for, furnishing another strong
argument for curtailing the city
within strictly residence districts.
The salary question is a vital one.
The county government costs over 92
per capital for salaries alone. If the
city government can get along with
one-nalt that rate, as the territory is
mapped out, it would be doing
tolerably well. On a low estimate
tbia item may be expected to run
from 82000 to $2500. How will this
sum up.

These are conservative figures. An
actual test will increase rather than
decrease thorn. There is no allow
ance here for fire protection : none
for quarantining against contagious
diseases, and numerous other itema
of expense. It leaves the cost of
street making and sewerage to be
borne either by the property holders
along the streets improved, or by
the issuance of bonds.
Summing up the situation as it
stands, it shapes itself this wise:
Incorporation holds out the pro
mise of a sewer tor Main street, the
grading of Main street by a system
atic effort, which has been entirely
lacking so far. Fot these improve
ments the property holders on that
street will have to pay by assess
ments levied according to frontage
owned. In . other word?, they have
these things by paying for them
under incorporation. They can have
them on the same proposition with
out incorporation. 'Again, incorpor
ation holds out the promise of a
public burial ground under official
supervision and we are willing; to
admit this is urgently needed.
On the other hand incorporation
along the present lines holds out the
prospect of a new set ot officials
to maintain. And the entire revenue
ot the city will be consumed, outside
of keeping up such utilities as we
vow enjoy, in paying the salaries of
the official establishment and , the
incidental expenses thereunto belong
ing. - * - :C. ' "d'Z&
Fears have been indulged in that
the stoppage of the railroad within
two miles of Jackson would tend to
build up a town about the depot, and
thereby exert a prejudice! influence
upon the business of the county seat.
We have no such fears, unless the
citizens of Jackson, unwittingly, con
tribute to bring about such a result
Jackson, as a trade center can be
handicapped, by piling up expenses
upon her business interests, making
it impossible for merchants to com
pete with housSs who are not ham
pered with like conditions. It is this
phase of the incorporation question
that appeals strongly to business
men. By increasing the cost of
doing business, whether by property
taxes or in the shape :of heavier
license taxes, or bonding pro
positions, such costs must be made
up by increased prices for goods.
Outside merchants are thereby helped
at the expense of the home-merchant.
By framing a city along lines that
cannot be otherwise than a very cost
ly experiment at municipal govern
ment, this danger of building up
rival places on the outskirts is entit
led to grave consideration.
The sample ballots and instructions
sent out therewith from the county
clerk's office are not complete. The
bnllots have neither numbers nor
perforated lines to indicate how the
ballot should be folded. The in
structions merely say, "To vote for a
person stamp a x in the square to the
right of the candidate's name." They
are silent as to voting on the main
issue of "for or against" incorpor
ation. Voters are reminded that
unless they stamp the x in one of the
squares to the right of "For incorpo
ration" or ■ 'Against incorporation,"
according to the wishes of the in
dividual voter, the ballot will not
count. A voter may stamp bis ballot
for all the officers on the ticket, but
unless he, in addition, expresses his
desires by a stamp in either of the
squares opposite the main question
involved, he will lose his vote on
that proposition. Voting for the
candidates on the ballot will not
carry by implication an affirmative
vote for incorporation. Per contra,
refusal to vote for the candidates will
not count as a negative vote on the
main issue. It is quite possible
therefore for the candidates to receive
a majority vote, and still the issue
in chief to be defeated. And of
course if incorporation falls to re
ceive a majority of all the votes cast
on that proposition, • the whole thing
miscarries, no matter how the vote
stands with regard to the candidates.

Adventures in the North.
From St. Michaels to Nome, it is
about 100 miles, nearly doe west.
The coast is low and Bandy, - and the
water near the shore is quite shallow.
-At 8 a. in. our ship dropped anchor
about a mile from shore, and gaso
line launobes landed those who chose
to go ashore for the modest sum of
two dollars, same price for returning.
Nome has many very good buildings,
and lies along the water front about
two miles. It was ' raining so there
was but little satisfaction iv .sight
seeing. We sailed southward just
before noon, butrying because a
storm seemed imminent, and there is
no harbor here. The Ohio is the
most luxuriously finished, and furn
ished steamship 1 have seen in the
north, aad the officers and crew take
pride in making evreything comfort
able and homelike for the passengers.
On the second day out a storm
from the north began, which increas
ed toga gale and we went at a furious
speed under steam and sail. The
wind was quartering to our course,
and the ship rolled badly, water
frequently coming over the leeward
sail. Nearly all the passengers wore
seasick, J am especially subject to
that horror, and for thirty-six hours
my plight was so wretched 1 had but
one wish— that the ship would go to
the bottom, and go quickly. On the
afternoon of the third day the storm
still continued and we were nearing
Unimak Pass. For two - days the
clouds had prevented the captain
from observing the sun at noon, it
was so foggy one could not see a
ship's length, and to crown all, the
ship's log, which measures the dis
tance traveled, became deranged.
The wind had blown us somewhat out
of our course, no one knew how
much, and the Pass is only a few
miles wide; sails were lowered and
steam shortened. It was an anxious
time for a tew hours, but just as the
captain was on the point of turning
the ship about, and facing the storm
until ue could determine our
location, the fog lifted enough to
show a familiar headland, only a
short distance from us. Full head
of steam was ordered at once and
everybody breathed easier. The next
morning the storm had ceased, the
rocky bluffs at the southern end of
the Pass were just visible above the
horizon, » and only the heavy swell of
the sea remained to lessen the plea
sure of the voyage. Five days of
splendid weather followed, while the
ship skimmed across the North
Pacific, often with not wind enough
to fill the sails.
On the morning of the Bth day, the
peaks of Vancouver Island showed io
the northeast, and we divided our
interest between watching them con
stantly grow larger and plainer, and
the whales which appear in unusual
numbers lately all along the coast.
Many believe that the shook of the
cannonading in the great battle on
the Japan sea, caused the whales to
cross the ocean. About noon we
passed the lighthouse at the entranoe
of the straits of Juan de Fuca and
welcomed a view of the United
States once more. The afternoon was
quite a change from the monotony of
chess, whist, books and the story
telling, for a fleet of fishing boats,
two ocean liners, the the towns of
New Dungeness, - Port Angeles and
Port Townsend, and the spires ot
Victoria away to the north, showed
that we were again in civilization.
Just after dark the myriads of elec
tric lights on the hills and along the
water front showed where Seattle, the
young giant of the northwest, is fast
becoming no mean rival of San Fran
cisco.
At 8:30 in the evening, the ship
was tied to the dock aud we were
soon installed in a comfortable hotel,
our first act was to get a sack ot
grapes, pears, plums and peaches,
and enjoy a luxurious feast, for
we had seen no really good fruit since
going into the Yukon basins. The
next day several things claimed our
attention, such as re-shipping some
freight, leaving a sack of gold dust
at the U. S. office, buying tickets
for Poriand and having our baggage
transferred and checked. All this
made us too late for the noon train, so
we went to Tacoma on the "Flyer,"
a small passenger- steamer that
makes several round trips daily.
At Tacoma we visited an uncle
of Mrs. MoK., whom she had not seen
for years, be included us all in his
welcome and we passed the night at
bis house. Tacoma was for several
years a rival of Seattle, out has long
been left hopelessly behind in the
race for becoming t.be metropolis of
this fast developing region. Still
Tacoma is a city of no small impor
tance having some 75,000 inhabit
ants, immense sawmills, a smelter,
many manufacturing plants and a
bustling spirit of "get there." It has
but one great railroad, the Northern
Pacific, a local road running about a
hundred miles eastward into the big
forests, a tine system of electrio roads
and the "Interurban" electric road
to Seattle. The city is oo a blutt, at
the southern extremity of Fuget
.Sound. After a pleasant visit includ
ing a feast of delicious ice cold water
melon, the first' 1 had tasted since
1899, we took the train for Portland
the following forenoon. Travel was
heavy on account of the exposition
and our train was run in two sec
tions of 12 cars each, all crowded. It
was a beautiful day and how we enjoy
ed this trip, our first '.'on land" for
many months. The strange looKing
cloud in the northeast caused a feel
ing of awe as we realized that it was
the summit ot Mt. Tacoma, grander
than many others of greater height
becauses it rises abruptly - more than
14000 feet above the level of the sur
rounding plains.
Toadyisms to British vanity was
the cause oi our official powers
changing this mountain's name from
the Indian one "l'acoma, " to that of
the English adveiSturer, "Rainier."
Our route lay across the plains of
Washington, where stumps of recent
forests k still appear among fields,
orchards ana thriving villages. Many
varieties of crops were in evidence,
hope being the principal one. , Only
a small fraction of this reigon is yet
cultivated, but the time cannot be
far distant when millions instead of
thousands will be enjoying this
superb climate and bountitul soil.
After several hours of this kind of
scenery we came to the Columbia,
one of the principal rivers, yet a
baby compared to the Yukon. Our
train was run upon, a ferry boat,
tilling its three tracks completely,
and in a few minutes taken from
Washington to Oregon. After an
hour's run through the maturer look
ing farms and villages ot the Will
iamette Valley we were landed at 1
o'colck in Oregon's chief city, Pert
land.

Arc due to Indigestion. Ninety-nine ef every
one hundred people who have heart trouble
can remember when it was simple indiges-
tion. It is a scientific fact that all cases of
heart disease, not organic, are not only
traceable to, but are the direct result of indi-
gestion. All food taken into the stomach
which fails of perfect digestion ferments and
swells the stomach, puffing it up against ths
heart. This interferes with the action of
the heart, and in the course of time that
delicate but vital organ becomes diseased.

cript of judgment secured in the jus
tice court lot San Francisco for the
sum of 822 07, recorded, j
The momentous question of whether
Jackson shall don city airs will be
decided Tuesday by the voters. The
voting districts are two— those living
south cf the middle fork will vote
at the planing mill, and those living
north, at the Spagnoli building
on Court street. There is really veiy
little interest taken in the election.
It is talked of but little, and one
would judge that a light vote will
be polled. There is- nothing like
the general interest in the affair as
was taken in the election four years
ago. ;^;vv

The Indian Reservation.
The Indian reservation, four miles
northeast ot Jackson, is in a bad
way financially. Tbe United States
established this asylum for the poor
red men hereabouts, where they could
find a home under the supervision of
government officials. In its estab
lishment it is possible that poli
tics and Self-interest played an im
portant role. Be that as it may. tbe
reservation has been running fora
number ot years, ostepsibiiy for the
benefit of the remnants of the Digger
tribe in this region, and it is the
duty ot the government while contin
uing the establishment to see that it
provided with means to carry out its
objects. Geo. O. Grist has bad charge
of tbe reservation for several years.
He is of a kindly and'sympathic na
ture, and tbe native sons and daugh-
ters are satisfied and contented, as
far as his oversight .is concerned.
They "have no fault to find with him
personally. .V-v
The number of Indians on the res
ervation at present is twelve. Since
Mr. Grist took charge, the number
cared for at one: time was 2G, and this
we believe is the greatest number
that has even been on the reserve at
one time. These Digger wards of tbe
government have been falling off in
number tor several years, instead ot
being attracted toward this -"home,"
they are being driven away. And
tbe cause of this exodus is a damag-
ing indictment against tbe United
States. It seems that no appropria-
tion has been made by congress for the
support of this reservation tor the
past two years. No rations are served
and provision made even to pro
vide seed for planting necessary food
stuffs. The Indians are left absolute-
ly without any protection, save the
root that covers them. Some of them
are old and infirm. One old squaw
was between 80 and 90 years old, and
stone blind. She came from Drytown
and remained on tbe reservation until
she was fairly starved by this policy
of "no appropriation." Last spring
she returned to Drytown, and fares
much better from tbe neighbors there
than from the tender mercies of tbe
government. Tho tew left try to eke
out a living fey begging from the
neighbors. Tbe neighbors are few in
that vicinity, and hence the straits
to which the ward are reduced
makes it a serious matter for them.
Some we bear, have had for their
own protection, to refuse to listen to
their appeals entirely. They can till
the soil fairly well, still their efforts
in this direction are badly handicap
ped by no funds.
The government pays the salary of
the resident agent, and provides not
a dollar to carry, out the benevolent
work expected of him. Appeals have
been made to remedy this condition,
but in vain. As it now exists the
reservation is a farce; a sham institu
tion, and a disgrace to a rich country
like the United States. Formerly
S2OOO per annum was appropriated for
the support of these .Indians, tbe last
two years not a cent. To pretend to
care for them, and leave them to beg
or starve, is unworthy of the Indian
department. Better abolish the re
servation altogether than keep it a
standing discredit to the United
States authorities. Congressman
Gillette will no doubt endeavor to
remedy the condition of affairs at
the reservation during tbe coming
session of congress.
Heavy Tax Payments
The taxes rolled into the tax
collector's office in a steady stream
dnring the las-t few days, before be
coming delinquent. The result is
that the collections this year amount
to something like 810,000 over the
amount received up to the same
period last year. The Standard
Electric Company paid in one dab,
for first installment, over 55000. The
total taxes of this and allied corpor
ations foot up SIICOO per year, fully
oue tenth of tho total revenue iron]
property taxes received in Amador
county. This is by all odds tbe
heaviest taxpaying concern in the
county. As is usually tho case, the
heavy taxpayers have come forward
with their coin promptly, the dilatory
ones being small taxpayers, the
penalty on their holdings being
insignificant.

Thanksgiving Ball.
The Social and Athletic Club gave
a grand ball in Lovo's hali on Wed
nesday evening, which was well
attended. Bower's orchestra from
Stockton furnished the music, and
this proved quite an attraction, draw
ing a number ot patrons from outside
towns. These musicians have gained
a reputation in tho county, and de
servedly so. Dancing was continued
until the small hours of tho morning.
The financial outcome was 'gratifying
to the club.

A New Gold Saving Experiment.
Messrs. Cbase and Boydston have
made arrangements to try an experi
ment in saving tbe gold that escapes
from the various mills around Jack
son by constructing a plant below the
junction of the three forks of Jackson
creek. They have leased from Harry
W. Jones a site for the erection of
their works at a point known as the
canyon— about a mile below the
town. Here they have commenced the
erection of a dam. We are not in a
position to explain the method of
their operations. It is well-known
that many hundreds ot dollars in
sulpburets and slimes pass down the
creek daily, and the parties that bit
on a plan to save a fair percentage of
this fugitive gold, are apt to. make a
fortune, it has been tried before.
It certainly ought to be possible to
make such a venture pay. 'JLhose who
have the matter in hand will exhaust
every means to insure a success.
There will be little expense attached
to tbe undertaking, when once placed
on an operating footing. The ground
rent is small, and there is no royalty
to pay. All they extract will be
practically for individual profit.

The Teachers' Institute.
The teachers' institute held in lone
last week is conceded as tbe most
instructive gathering of the kind
held in the county. The instructors
from tbe outside were masters in
their respective departments. Mrs.
Winterburn's addresses were full of
valuable information, sbe is acknow
ledged to be an authority on the sub
ject asigned her— history and litera
ture. ; -•;. '•
Professor D. R. Augsburg was
equally at home on his subject of
"Drawing." The way he bandied
it, and drew out the mechanical akill
for pupils from the school to practi
cally demonstrate his ideas, was
complimented by all. D. R. Wood
of the State JSormal Sohool at San
Jose, presented "Nature study" in
several phases, and elicited general
admiration in his method of impart
ing instruction on this broad subject.
• The teachers were all very muoh
pleased with the cordial weclorae
given them by the people of lone.
The churches gave the use of their
buildings in which to hold tbe meet
ing, also tbe use of the organs And
the hotels were very reasonable in
their charges for. board and rooms.
The lone and Eastern railroad made
a. substantial reduction in the round
trip fare for the benefit of the
Echoolmams. Altogether, . it was a
meeting to be remembered, every one
carrying away pleasing recollections,
as well as profitable instruction from
tbe visit to the valley town.

Volcano Stage Time Changed.
A change of time in the arrival and
departure of the Volcano mail stage
will go into effect from today, Decem
ber Ist. It is impossible during tbe
winter months for the mail to leave
tor Volcano after tlie arrival of ' the
San Francisco mail. During the
summer the Voloanoites have been
getting the mail from San Francisco
and eastern points the same day as
Jackson, although of course several
hours later. To continue this service
in tho short winter days, would mean
making the trip both ways in tbe
darkness, a dangerous business in
the rough roads incident to the wet
season. To day the stage will leave
at 0:15 a. m. and arrive at sp. m.
This schedule will run until May Ist,
when the summer schedule will pro
bably be again adopted.

Communication.
Editor Amador Ledger. — Please be
kind enough to publish through the
columns of your valuable paper, for
the information of the voters, where
tbe corners are of the proposed in
corporation, so that we could draw a
line from one corner to the other and
thereby find out whether we live in
side of the lines or not, and who are
entitled to vote.
1 was reading tbe description ot
the proposed lines published in the
Amador Dispatch about tbe south
east corner and the north west half
of Section 1, etc. But we want it
shown to us a good . deal plainer so
that we can understand where we are
living.
There are not ten voters in Jaokson
who understand by that description
where the boundary lines are. But
unless all signs fail, it does not
matter much where the lines are or
how they run, as it is likely to be
voted down by a large majority. I
don't think the property owners are
so foolish as to fasten upon them
selves another set of officers.
I was talking to one ot the lawyers
of Amador county, only two weeks
ago, he told me that tbe law was very
plain, and tbere was ample law to
govern the townships if the officers
would only do their duty, and put
tbe laws in force, and not allow tilth
to be thrown into our streets to en
danger the health and lives of : our
people. I think the condition of
things is shameful, when we elect
officers and pay them big salaries,
and they swear before they enter
upon tbe duties of their office that
they will obey and enforce the laws
to the best of their ability.
Now, fellow citizens, only take
one good, look at tbe town and see
lemon peels and slops thrown in the
middle ot our . streets, and say
whether another set of officers will
help matters. If those officers would
do their duty and stop these and
other unlawful things from going on,
we would never think of incorporat-
ing, whereby our taxes will be in
creased nearly double the present
rates. ; Think this matter over very
carefully before you cast your votes
and don't be led astray by (would be)
office holders and seekers, who will
have everything to gain and nothing
to lose.
Tbe Amador Dispatch said in its
last .issue that if tbe town is incorpor
ated the first thing that ought to
be done is to get the town surveyed
and the lots blocked otf. That would
cost from 81000 to 81500 to begin
with. So you bad better be very
careful how you vote.
Yours respectfully.
. A Taxpayer. ; I
We are unable to answer the . ques
tion concerning tbe boundary lines.
It would require an official survey to
determine the matter. Such a survey
ought to have been made at the out
set of the incorporation movement.
Tbe idea of running on government
lines simply to avoid the expense of
a special survey is tbe greatest mis
take made in the whole affair. A
proper survey of strictly residence
districts, drawing the lines as closely
as possible to the thickly settled
territory, would have saved the city
government the cost of tbe orginal
survey many times over every year.

Found With Broken Hip on Shed.
Crazed by tbe pain of an abcess in
his left ear, il. Martell, an old man
living at.loß Sixth street, wandered
from his home at G o'clock last night,
and at 9 :30 was ■ found lying on tbe
roof ot a shed in the rear of 1275
Mission street, with his head cut' and
bruised and his left hip broken. He
bad fallen from a window in the
second story of the house, landing on
the shed.
•It was necessary to break down a
wooden fence and pass tho old man
tbrougbh a small hole to the stairs ot
the next house to get him from tbe
room to the Central Emergency am
bulance. Martell weighs about 200
pounds, and in handling the stretcher
Steward James .ODea severely
wrenched his back. Martell. was
treated at tbe hospital by Dr. G. W.
The above is from the Examiner ot
the 28th. it is believed that it refers
to Li N. Martell, of the station, who
left here for San Francisco two weeks
ago for surgical treatment for an üb
cess in the ear.
A letter was received at tbe Martell
home yesterday, removing all doubt
as to the identity of the injured man
It was L. N. Martell. It seems be
was accompanied to the city by his
wife. They bad taken rooms on Sixth
street, where Mrs Martell was attend
ing to him. When the accident .oc
curred Mrs. Martell had retired to
take much needed rest, and was sleep
ing soundly at -the time. She bad
been waiting on him almost con
stantly since his arrival in the city,
and was compelled to seek rest. She
can give no account of how be came
to walk out of a door or. window. He
was reported to be in a very danger
ous condition. He is now under
treatment at one of tbe hospitals.
Mrs. Martell is staying in Oakland in
tbe meantime, visiting her busband
daily, tit;
Lemons, oranges, and bananas con
stantly on hand at, Nettle's Mkt.
MINING NOTES.
Kennedy— Tbe pile of waste from
the cblorination works has been sold
to the Selby reduction works. Teams
are now hauling the material to
Martell's for shipment to the works
near Vallejo. Tbe dump consists of
many thousands of tons, and its
removal will extend over a consider
able length of time. A scientific
professor from Berkeley was here
for several months experimenting
upon these tailings, with the object
of extracting the gold therefrom on
the ground at a profit to the Kennedy
company. The results were unsatis
factory, however, and the company
concluded to sell the stuff outright
to the Selby works. The sulpburets
are valuable for mixiDg with other
ores that are received at tbeeo works
for treatment, and not only for tbe
precious metal they contain. This
sale of the chlorinatlon dump pile ot
the Kennedy Js the first practloal
illustration of the development of
new industries as the outcome of the
advent of the railroad. It has been
known all along that this refuse
carried considerable value. Experi
ments of various kinds have been
tried at different points along the
lode to extract the gold, but so tar
without success, as a financial pro
position, it coat more to extract the
gold than it was worth. To haul the
material to lone, 12 miles, was also
more than the value of tbe sulpburnts
would stand. With the railroad with
in easy distance the sulphurets can be
shipped to the bay, and a large
quantity of heretofore useless mater
ial becomes a marketable commodity.
It is not unlikely that other dump
piles of the same nature, will become
marketable.
! Central Eureks— We understand that
tbis mill has started a few stamps us
ing a water supply from a natural
stream near by. It will be some time
before the stamps along the mother
lode get into full "steady working.
The ditch has to depend upon rain
tall in a great measure, below the
head of the canal, as above that point
the snow and streams are frozen, and
the water supply from the river is
low, and will continue low through
the winter. Tbe ground owing to tbe
prosracted dry spell, will absorb a
large amount of rainfall, before it
becomes so saturated as to find its
way to the canal.
The Season of Indigestion.
The season of indigestion is upon
us. Kodol Dyspepsia Cure for indi
gestion and dyspepsia will do every
thing for the stomach that an over
loaded or over- worked stomach can
not do for itself. Kodol digests what
you eat— gives the stomach a rest
relieves "sour stomach, belching,
heart burn, indigestion, etc. Sold by
all druggists.

Western Pacific Activities.
Local representatives of the West
ern Pacific Railroad are very active
in this state nowadays, but are veil
ing tbier movements in a vapor of
mystery aud exciting a great deal
of curiosity in financial circles. .' lt
is believed that they are intent upon
absorbing several electric roads in
the interior, and as Lewis Hanchett
is supposed to be working in the
interest of tbe company it is inferred
that George Crocker is largely in
terested in the enterprise. Mr.
Hanchett is a brother of the late
Mrs. George Crocker, and he looks
after the financial interests of his
brother-in-law on this coast. It Ms
said that when tbe trunk line at the
Western Pacific is completed the com
pany will have a number of branch
lines all ready for business. There is
an immense amount of money being
spent by the Goulds on this coast and
they have lawyers galore iv their em
ploy attending to all tbe preliminary
business incident to the acquisition
of franchises and rights-of-way.
Among tbe men in their employ is
VV. M. Rank, formerly of the North
Shore road, who quit that corpor
atiion in a hurry, when it was ab
sorbed by Harriman. Years ago he
was the general agent of the Denver
and Rio Grande. Among the law
yers on Ihe company's staff is M.
E. Cerf, who has a knack for making
advantageous deals.— Town Talk.

lone Defeated Stockton High.
'In one of the most exciting games
girls have played in Stockton for
months, the lone basketball team
yesterday afternoon defeated the
Stockton high schools girl by a
scoie of 11 to 3 on the high school
campus. The losers assert that it
was one of the prettiest and cleverest
contests ever seen here, as no undue
advantage was taken by either side.
The Stockton girls also assert that
the contest was won on its merits
and that the visitors simply outplayed
the home team.
The locals were taken at a disad
vantage as they had not expected the
lone tean to come here* until two
weeks later. The visitors were coach
ed by Professor Inch, who was
tormeily a member of the Kiverside
champion amateur team, and the girls
who played here yesterday will be
hard to defeat. The Stockton players
were not well organized and were
sadly lacking in team work, but they
iutended to keep at work and hope to
even up matters latter, when another
game will be played.
The line-up of the two teams was
as follows :
lone— Lydia Winter and Margaret
Merchant, foi wards; Olive Gordon
and Amy Clark, centers; Violet Woods
and Mildred Isaacs (captain), guards.
Stockton— Pansy Castle and Emma
Fohl, forwards, Berl Gardner (cap
tain), and- Evelyn Morse, centers;
Kuth Phillips and Hazel Kidenour,
guards.— lndependent.

Bailey, a South African millionaire, of
30,000 acres of farm land in Rhodesia,

The chestnut is, according to medical
men, most digestible, and can not only
take the place of the potato, as in
France, where chestnuts, boiled and
mashed like potatoes, make a delicious
dish, but in reality forms a more per
fect form of food.
Bagpipes, although the national Scot
tish instrument, have only two Scottish
articles used in their construction, the
sheepskin and tartan. The wood —
ebony or cocus — comes from Africa or
Jamaica, the ivory from Africa, the horn
from Australia, and the cane for the reed
from Spain.
A writer on Norway says: "Our
familiar nursery friends. Jack and Jill,

are rather aptly described in the nur
sery rhyme."

A fellow will often run into debt

You can generally tell a married
man. He is such a good listener,
i It's because courtship is such a pose
that marriage is often such a failure.

"In the year 1903 my health was poor,"
writes Mrs. J. Heck, of 243 Broadway. Buf-
falo. N. Y. " I suffered from f all inir of womb,
a disagreeable discharge, painful monthly
periods, headache, backache and pains in
the limbf. Every month was confined to bed
for two or three days. Was weak, nervous
and hysterical; tife was a burden to myself
and I made every one in the family unhappy
because I was so irritable. My husband got
me four bottles of Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre-
scription, and before I bad taken the first
bottle I was feeling some relief. The medi-
cine made me well and strong, free from nerv-
ousness, aches and pain, and I felt like a new
woman. Before I used the 'Favorite Pre-
scription ' I had been taking another physl-
clan'i medicine for nearly three months, but
had received no benefit. Your medicine is
certainly the best in the world." .- i 7i 7

Plans to build electric street car
lines in Peking have aroused a great

Swimming in the Bain.
"Whoop ! It's rainin'." This was the
cry that burst from nearly every boy at
the public bath one day lately, as the
rain poured down on the wet heads 01
the swimmers. "There seems to be f
great charm in swimming in the rain,'
said William Long, life saver at th<
bath. "One kid whose half-hour hac
expired said: 'I hate like the dickens
to go out while Its rainin'. It gives yoi
such a nice, smooth kind of prickly feel
ing. It saams to be a shower bath am
a tub bath combined. When there an
boys in the pool while its raining yo»

Olive Oil in Massage.
Olive oil is nourishing nsed as an
unguent in massage, bat neatsfoot
oil (made from hoofs of beeves) is
better, being more penetrating.
However, for a nervous invalid, there
is something better than either, being
both a nutriment and tonic, namely,
quinine ointment. This is tbe remedy
of remedies for a pony or teething
baby, or for an invalid of any age.
When physicians i prescribe it— as
some do— it costs two or three dollars
to have it compounded in a drug
store. ' It may be made at home for
a few cents. To one cupful of pure
lard add sixteen grains of quinine
for a child, twenty or twenty-two
grains for an adult, and beat' hard
together for a full hail hour. A soup
plate and silver fork are the best
utensils. Give the patient a thorough
rubbing with this all over the body,
rubbing in as much as the skin will
absorb.' Under the arms, knees and
soles of the feet tbe absorption will
be found very great. Less will be
needed as time goes on, but as the
ointment will keep, the quantity
made does not signify. The skin
should be bathed with hot water
(using snap) before the daily applic
ation and rubbing. Within two or
three weeks improvement will work
a metamorphis in an ailing baby,
child or nervous invalid. For
malarial troubles it does wonders
far beyond what any internal dosing
can accomplish; bat you will need to
be persistent in its application. ■
Sheep Diminishing in Numbers.
Ihe world's supply of sheep is
rapidly diminishing. In ten years
there has been a decrease of nearly
72,000,000, or pretty close to one
seventh ot all the flocks of the earth.
It appears that the higher the civiliz
ation the fewer the sheep. Great
grazing lands from the extreme end
of South America to the plains of
Russia, which onoe pastured great
flocks of sheep, are gradually being
tamed over to agriculture. In
Canada the number of sheep is stead
ily falling. Germany according to
the American Wool Reporter, has now
but 10,000,000, where halt a century
ago it had three times that. In India
the flocks have lots a seventh in
eleven years, while in Spain, whioh is
the home of the finest fleeces in the
world, they lost a fifth in a brief
eight years. . Nearly one- seventh of
the entire supply of sheep is in
Kussia, but they are of an inferior
breed, and the wool Is in demand by
foreign countries.
Quaint Indian Funeral Customs.
Many strange Indian tribes live
around Hudson Bay. The Creek and
Naacoppie Indians are among these
tribes, who have a peculiar ouatom in
regard to their "dead. As soon as one
of their number is dead, the surviv
ng relatives place the dead, one in
a box which they beg trom the Hud
son Bay Company, in this box are
placed, witn a loaded gun, a powder
horn, a tobacco pouch, a flint stone
for. striking fire, the snowshoes for
travel, and an ax.
. This box is then carried to the top
of the nearest hill and set there with
stones upon the top of it. For ten
days it is left undisturbed, and then
the relatives remove the gun and
other valuables, believing that by
that time the dead one has reached
the happy bunting grounds and has
no turtner use for them.—Washing

Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign.
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. For
weak indigestion, for defective nour
ishment, for consumption, take
Scott's Emulsion. It lestores flesh
because it strikes to the cause of the
loss.

LIKE A PIRATE OF OLD.
ALEXANDER MACLEAN ROAMED
THE SEA IN SWIFT SCHOONER.
Accompanied by Thirty Reckless
Buccaneers He Defied Governments
and Gunboats— Now in Tolls of the
Law.
There's never a law of God or man
Runs north of fifty-three.
Captain Alexander Mac Lean, as bold
a rover as ever lived during the priv
ateering days when pirate ships lay
waiting in the pathway of Spanish gal
leons, will roam the sea no more. That
is, he will not sail the deep in that
free-handed manner which made him
the object of search by United States
and British authorities. A few weeks
ago, under an indictment for conspi-
racy in fitting his schooner Car
meucita in violation of the sealing
laws, he was arrested at Victoria, Brit
ish Columbia. The Department of State
received a telegram announcing the ar
rest of a crew made up of men said
to be
"As choice a band of pirates and cut
throats as ever manned a pirate craft
since the days of Captain Kldd."
Mac Lean's home has ever been on
the sea; he knows no life but that on
the deep blue and he finds no enjoy
ment on shore. He has been a rover
and not a freight carrier, and any altre
devil enterprise at sea that needed a
strong arm could find an adherent in
Captain Mac Lean, whether in search
of pirate treasure, running a contra
band cargo or illegally poaching for
seals found him the man; he has had
, experience in all. Mac Lean's ship, the
Carmencita, was formerly the Jenny
rhelin, builf in 1869, when speed and
not carrying capacity was desired.
Poacr.ing for Seals.
What the rakish looking schooner
did prior to 1894 had nothing to do
with Mac Lean's operations, but it was
alleged in April. 1904, that the schooner
was chartered and outfitted for a poach
ing cruise among the rookeries of the
far north. The Russo-Japanese war be
ing then uppermost in the minds of the
two nations concerned, it was consid
ered by the poachers that they would
CAPT. ALEX. MACLEAN.
not be in a position to guard their in
terests, and a raid on the Russian seal
ing islands was the real object of the
cruise. Great Britain, Canada and the
United States have an * agreement to
prevent pelagic sealing, so that appar
ently to protect the ship's owner from
prosecution under either United States
or British laws, the ship's name was
changed to Carmencita and registry
papers taken out in Mexico.
Thirty Devils at Beck and Call.
On May 5 she headed for the north
ern islands, Mac Lean sitting aft, thirty
reckless dare-devils forward and cases
of repeating rifles and ammunition in
the captain's cabin. She had cleared
for "Victoria for a cargo, but instead
sailed for the little islands in the Ber
ing Sea, where it was understood a
new rookery was discovered.
Captain Mac Lean ha" had a varied
experience with tl c authorities, not
only on the Carina cita, but on other
vessels of which h\ was master. At
one time a revenue <futtr • annoyed him
by demanding that his"- papers be sent
on board for examination. Upon his
refusal the revenue officers threatened
to open fire on him.
Invoked the Stars and Stripes.
Mac Lean hearing this, ordered one
The Amador Ledger.
of his men to "runup the flag." The
Stars and Stripes were hoisted and
"Big Alec," aa he is known, yelled out,
"Now fire and be d d to you." The
revenue cutter dipped its flag thrice
and turned away. Several times this
bold navigator has had set-tos with gov
ernment authorities, but a short time
ago the Carmencita made a raid on the
copper islands and had a brush with
the revenue patrol, one of the crew be
ing wounded and sent to Seattle, Wash.,
for treatment.
The attention of Mexico having been
called to the illegal acts of the Car
mencita's crew, that government on
November 1, 1904, cancelled the Mex
ican registry. With this taken away
from him, Mac Lean had the name of
the schooner changed to the Acapulco.
It is understood that when he dropped
into Drake Bay for supplies he had
only 100 skins on board taken from
the sealing preserves of the Arctic so
that government officials have suspect
THE PIRATE'S SCHOONER
Ed that the great amount of mtmey dis
played on that occasion must have
come elsewhere than from the fund de
rived from the sale of skins. The gov
ernment agents believe that several
men now under indictment in the West
in connection with this, poaching trip
furnished the funds.
Always Eluded the Law.
Mac Lean's movements were conduct
ed so cleverly that he could never be
held until now; he always made the
technicalities of the law cover his op
erations, but the Department of Justice
has been gathering evidence through
the personal direction of Chief Wilkie
of the Secret Service and it was this
evidence that led to his indictment
in San Francisco a short time ago. So
now the piratical course of Captain
Alexander Mac Lean seems at an end
and the stern hand of the law holds
him in its grip. It remains to be seen
whether his luck will again serve him
in good stead and enable him to sail
away to the "great white silence"
where the treasured fur-bearing ani
mals are found, or whether the govern
ment's evidence will be strong enough
to shacks him.
Japanese Dwarf Trees.
In Japan are some very remarkable
trees. They are hundreds of years
old and not a hundred inches high.
The most marvelous collection is in
Count Okuma's garden, near Tokio.
Here are pine trees that started to
grow in the seventeenth century, that
at the dawn of the twentieth century
are not too large to be carried in one
hand, pot and all. Others, whose seed
was planted about the time when Co
lumbus sailed for America, are already
outstripped by saplings planted year
before last.
In another place is a grove of lili
putian plum trees, gnarled and knotted
and twisted by centuries of wind and
weather, that are none of them too
large to grace a dinner table, as they
often do when in full bloom. More
marvelous still, there are other little
trees, probably planted in the early
"sixties," that are still thriving (it is
too much to say "growing") in a tea
cup, while others planted before Cleve
land's last term in office have not out
grown a lady's thimble.
The Japanese are past masters in
the art of dwarfing trees. They nip
off the tree's roots and pinch its limbs
and starve it with little soil and let
it go thirsty and dry, but at the' same
time keep the breath of life in it, un
til it becomes the veriest travesty of
a tree, a manikin vegetable, with the
wrinkled face of an old man on the
legs of a little boy. Infinite patience
and skill and time are given in order
to stunt and dwarf into these gro
tesque growths.
Will Wed for Love Only.
Princess Victoria' of England, the
only unmarried daughter of King Ed
ward, declares that if she marries at
all it will be for love. She is thirty
seven years old, and for twenty years
has refused to consider every marriage
proposal suggested by her father, the
King.
"If I marry, it will be to the man of
my choice, 1 ' she is reported to have
said. "Father, mother, and govern
ment shall not choose for me. I will
love the man I marry, if I ever marry."
This bold declaration by the daughter
of a king has shocked royal and aristo
cratic circles all over Europe, but it
has been read with delight by the
English people, and it appeals equally
to Americana.
JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY, CAL., DEC, 1, 1905.
FREEDOM FOR RUSSIA.
under czar's recent mani
festo, last absolute mon-
WWarcht disappears.
The New Empire Promises to Be a
Regime of Constitutional Liberty
and Representation— Victory of the
People Widely Celebrated.
A3 an outcome of the tremendous
agitation which has been shaking Rus
sia to the very core, the Czar has sur
rendered and has granted rights
which if consummated, will result iv.
civil liberty. . -.
| It seenied for a time as though the
history ofc the French revolution would
be repeated; that the aristocracy and
the 'bureaucracy driving ahead in
their arrogance and self esteem, would
fail to ' recognize the overwhelming
force' of 'the volcano of public senti
ment surrounding them, and by their
refusal to recognize conditions, plunge
the whole empire into civil war anil
anarchy. But the handwriting on the
wall was recognized and the Czar
compelled to practically capitulate his
imperial throne. Tru.e, promises arc
thus, far more in evidence than fulfill
ment, but Count Witte has apparently
been made the real Russian leader unu
much is hoped and expected in the
way of a peaceful reform.
In old Russia, the Russia of last
centuryv of last year, of last week, the
Czar was all- powerful. Russia was
the last remaining absolute monarchy.
The policies of the government were
created and enforced by the Czar and
his Grand Dukes. -"■
Popular representation was a fragile
promise. Free speech was under the
ban; freedom of the press was un
known. Even alf private mail, was
subject to censorship. The prisons
were filled with political offenders.
Imagine casting a man into a United
States prison because his political acts
were not relished by the government!
A system of public espionage fol
lowed every man's move.
Old Russia was divided into two
classes, the nobility and practical
slaves. '••■>■ >.-.•.'-■
Education of the masses was worse
than a farce.
What is promised for Russia?
The abolition of the rule of the Ro
manoff House.
. Freedom of speech guaranteed and
freedom of person inviolable.
A limited monarchy similar to that
of England with a guarantee of popu
lar government, with a cabinet respon
sible to the people, and with suffrage
made almost universal, and witlf provi
sion for a representative parliament
and for a general educational system.
The right of habeas corpus recog
nized and the freedom of the press
assured.
Following the Czar's imperial mani
festo outlining the proposed regime of
liberty, all Russia celebrated. In St.
Petersburg and Moscow the day was
one such as the Russians never before
had seen. The Slavic people, who dur
ing the long war just closed and the
anxious period preceding the, an
nouncement of the new era of consti
tutionalism, seemed self restrained,
gloomy and apathetic, gave themselves
fully to the exuberance of the mo
ment and spent the entire day in pa
rades and assemblies which for the
first time in the history of Russia were
freely permitted.
It was stated as a significant omen
that after a fortnight of gloomy and
depressing weather, symbolic of the
days of the great strike, the sun shone
out brightly on the date of tlip Czar's
manifesto, a bright and radiant In
dian-summer day.
The Aromatic Havana.
Apropos of the real enjoyment of a
cigar Cauthorne, the newspaper cor
respondent, in that most fascinating
story of "The Tallahasse Girl":
"If you will permit me. I will
smoke." said he, taking out a curious
cigar case of very fine workmanship.
"It does not even amount to a kind
ness on my part," she answered; "for
I enjoy the fragrant sweet of a good
cigar."
S "Thank you, I can never fully appre
ciate an open air chat without the
company, of this Indian luxury. But
really I am no great smoker. Two or
three a day are all I take." -
"You must be an exception. Papa
smokes twenty pipes full -a day, and
most gentlemen are always indulging."
"Yes, they lose sight of the equisiie
part of the thing which is a subtle
pleasure coming only to those who use
tobacco of the finest quality and spar
ingly."
Sometimes I abstain for several days
in order to get the full benefit of a
slow burning Havana."
Huge Precious Stones.
Prior to the discovery of the South
African diamond a few months ago,
weighing in the neighborhood of a
pound. and a half, the largest perfect
diamond in the world was that which
was exhibited in Paris, having a value
of one million dollars. This was the
most valuable stone in the world; the
; largest and. best ruby in existence is
owned in 'London, and is valued, at
$50,000. It has no parallel, even in
the Crown Jewels, and it is related
that it was once carried all the way to
St Petersburg for the Czar to have a
look at. The largest and most beauti
ful cats-eye in existence •weighs one
hundred and seventy carats and is in
sured for 30,000 rupees. The bigcest
emerald in the world weighs 2,980
carats, and is in the Imperial Jewel
Office in Vienna.
The most costly church of ita size,
in America, is in the quaint old town

DRESS REFORM FOR WOMEN.
Advocate of Practical Walking and
Working Garb— Relief From
Heavy Skirts.
Dr. Cora Smith Eaton, of Minneap
olis, Minn., believes that many of tne
aches and ills from which women
suffer are the direct result of the
clothes they wear. She says that in
her professional capacity she tries to
impress upon her women patrons the
need of dress reform. "Not the old
time hideous bloomer costume of
years ago," laughed the doctor, "but
a rational, sensible and beautiful
adaptation of our' clothes to our
needs." » ■ . : ■ v • :

way. Her body, sensibly clothed,
and beautifully poised, with that fine,
straight line beloved of physical cul

HUGE IRRIGATION DAM.
ROCK BARRAGE ACROSS NARROW]
' CANYON IN MOUNTAINS OF
WYOMING.
Government Works Will Store Ftood
Waters For Fertilization of One
Hundred and fifty Thousand Des
ert Acres.
A quarter of a century ago -the
home of the buffalo, and later a cat
tle and sheep pasture, with an occa
sional ranch house, the Big Horn
Basin in Wyoming is now the scene of
a great activity incident to the build
ing of one of the largest of the govern
ment irrigation works. Some years
ago Colonel Cody, better - known as
Buffalo Bill, made a survey of the
tshoshone canyon, and in connection
with General Miles, projected a com
pany to construct a dam and irrigate
some 60,000 acres. The necessary cap
ital however was not forthcoming and
when the national irrigation law was
passed, the government took up the
proposition, and a large party, of en
gineers has since been employed on
the preliminaries of a great work of
desert reclamation.
The Shoshone River dashes down a
narrow canyon, with jagged and per
pendicular walls, and at its narrow
est point the government has begun
j the construction of the highest dam
i ever built. It will cement together
the two canyon walls for 1 240 feet
above the stream bed, and its founda
tion will go below- the water line 86
ifeet additional, down to the solid bed
rock. The stream, where , it; passes
between these granite canyon walls, is
but 05 feet wide, and the dam will
form a great lake of 5,000 acres, with
a watershed of 1.250 square miles,
and storing enough water to irrigate
130.000 acres through seven miles of
14-foot ; tunnels bored in the sojid
rock. . I
Little Chance For Land Grabbing.
This will cost about $25 an acre to '
be paid back to the government by,
settlers, under the business-like pro
visions of the irrigation law. The land
flood and then boiling over great rocks
itself is free under the homestead act,
and has been reserved by Secretary
Hitchcock from entry under the
Desert and other land laws not requir
ing actual residence and home-build
ing.
Few such picturesque and wildly ,
beautiful scenes can be found as this
Shoshone canyon. The river is a suc
cession of foaming, rushing rapids, the
water coursing along in a deep green
flood, and then boiling over great rocks
and boulders in a white surge. Only
for a few hours each day can the sun
find its^-way to the bottom of this
deeply-cut gorge, the mountain sides
towering into the clouds two and three
thousand feet. From above the dam
site as one looks down at the engin
eers working on the foundations,
directly underneath, they appear like
mimic men.
Giant Forces of Nature.
This Shoshone canyon and its sur
rounding mountains, are one of
nature's great handiworks. All has
been .cut out by the silver stream,
rushing in its bed below. For count
less ages it has eaten its way through
granite and limestone, wearing, wear
ing, wearing away. For centuries and
ages it has flowed, ceaselessly and
likewise" uselessly on its way to join
the flood of the Missouri; now it is to
be harnessed and made to produce for
man. A thousand farmers will make

In the canyon proper the great -
forces of nature have wrought won
derfully. Enormous granite boulders
have" detached themselves from the
mountains and rolled down thousands -
of feet, crashing their hundreds and
thousands of tons into the rocky
gorge. Here the river continually
plays upon them, searching out the
seams and splitting them up, and
wearing them away and polishing
them smooth.
The Rock Pile of the World.
In the canyon's middle, below the
dam site, the jungle of rocks in the
narrow river bed appears as though a
thousand blasts of giant powder had
rent the mountain sides and tumbled
every rugged projection into the
depths below. There is no dirt or
sand in this river bed; everything is
rock. The imperishable granite, gray,
pink, and vari-colored, oldest of the
geological formations, made by the
welding of various substances when
the globe was a molten mass; the
later limestones and black volcanic
rocks, conglomerates also melted by .
great heat, the hard red sandstone and
its white and brown contemporaries,
formed from the grindings of other
rocks subjected to enormous pressure,
and lastly the geyserites and sulphur
rocks, soft and honeycombed,' the re
sult of ceaseless spoutings of steam
and hot water from the earth's bowels
—all are found in wonderful profu
sion, i
Below the canyon where the river
runs more peacefully, all these forma
tions are represented in the huge beds
of cobble stones and smaller boulders
over which the water plays. The cob
blestones were themselves once jagged
rocks, detached by wind, water, frost
and sun from their mountain bases,
and rolled and ground by river force

A Giant Fire Cracker. --'V ,■
Watching the government engineers
cutting a road along the side of the
canyon for the transportation of sup
plies to build the damMW.OOO barrels
of cement alone will be needed— the
writer observed the explosion of a big
charge of dynamite, which burst with
a roar, echoing up and down the can
yon with deafening reverberations.
Immediately an oblong granite rock of
some 150. tons weight was torn from
its base and hurled down into the river
a hundred feet below. Shatters of
rock flew in all directions, and a great
splash of water rose like a geyser out
of the black depths of the canyon.
Yet this huge block of granite was
but a baby addition to the family of
boulders which had been detached by
more giant forces of nature, and
thrown into the river bed. A few
hours before we had crawled directly
under this rock In our canyon "explor
ation." Returning, we were fain to
accept the assistance of one of the
road builders in getting across this
place, looking down the while into the
river boiling below among the rocks.
The engineering credit for this
great project with its great dam
its enormous spillways, its, moun
tain road building and its miles of
canals and huge tunnels bored
through the solid rock is due to
Jeremiah Ahem ,a government dis
trict engineer who, almost cut off from

The Government Irrigation Program
What does all this great irrigation
work of the government throughout
the west signify? Simply that the
nation has decided to use the money
derived from the sale of western
public lands to make its desert soil of
value, and furnish many home-build
ing opportunities. It means that
many men will find employment in
the construction of dams and canals
m every western community, and that
nnally, as the works are completed
one by t>ne, new farm homes will be
established, adding to the nation's
wealth and balancing our population
now inclined cityward. <r
For a thousand years longer this
splendid dam site would likely stand
idle before private capital would de
velop it to its magnificent full capac
ity, for the difliculties in the way of
the engineers are manj- and unknown*
but the government will meet all ob
stacles and overcome them, and finally
turn over to a thousand farmers a
perfect job of engineering, compara
ble to the great works of the Peru
vian Incas, the Egyptian Rameses or
the British engineers of India— an en
during monument for all time to the
wisdom of the present generation of
America.FITZHUGH LEE'S ESCAPE.

One warm summer evening in 1595, 1
sat smoking with Judge Jenkins, of
Wisconsin, who is now ably represent
ing his State in Congress.
We were watching the oncoming of
a heavy thunder storm, and the conver
sation had turned, as it often did, to
the time of his youth when he entered
the Union army and was, by the stir
ring events of the war, transformed
into the fearless, iron-manhood 'that
lias since characterized him.
"It was just such an evening in the
summer of 'G2," he remarked, "that I
nearly killed Fitzhugh Lee."
"We were down in Virginia, and 1
was in charge of an ammunition train
which was on its way to McClellan'3
army.
We had been halted by a brief or
der from headquarters, and directed to
remain where we were — near a little
village about thirty miles south of
Washington.
"Xo reason was given for the delay,
though some of the boys thought it
was for the purpose of enabling an
escort of cavalry to join us. Others
said they guessed 'Mac' didn't have
any further use for powder. How
ever, we' were mighty glad to go into
camp, as many of the raw men were
about 'bushed' by the long and hot
marching, besides it gave us oppor
tunity to forage and get better rations
than hard-tack and maggoty bacon — so
lively that it followed us around camp.
"We pitched our tents in an open
field, a short distance to the east of
a high road which stretched away to
. ward home. About a quarter of a mile
to the south was a thick piece of tim
ber.
The Old Pie Woman.
"The third day we were in camp a
woman came through selling pies. Wa
thought nothing of her visit, other
than that her pies were home-made
and tasted awfully good.
"It was just such a day as this,"
continued the Judge, "and in the af
ternoon the heat became very oppres
sive. As the evening wore on we
observed thunder-heads piling up in
the southwest; and the boys prophe
sied that we would have a break in
the hot spell.
"I became uneasy as the night wore
on, and walked about the camp watch
ing the flashes of distant lightning and
the dark masses of drifting clouds
which seemed' to be flanking us on
the north. - '
GEN. FITZHUGH LEE.
I realized that the open field offered
the more safety for the ammunition in
case of severe lightning. Still an un
accountable sense of impending danger
possessed me; and, acting upon what
appeared to be a foolish impulse, I
ordered the boys to move all of ths
ammunition into the timber just below
the ! camp. Tills was done without
lights; and the tents and other equip
age were allowed to stand where they
were. Camp fires were lighted as
usual.
"The more 1 thought of the pie-wo
man, the more suspicious it made me;
and feeling ill at ease, I spoke to some
of the boys about her visit. They joked
about it and suggested that her pie
had given me indigestion.
" 'Why,' my orderly said, 'there ain't
a Johnnie reb nowheres around here.
They're all down there with "Mac"
keepin' him busy.'
" 'That's all right," said another, 'but
why were we halted here, if there's
no danger?'
Doubled the Pickets.
"No one voluntered an answer to
his question, and I decided it would be
wise to double the pickets.
The men who were detailed for the
extra duty grumbled some, and as they
started for their posts one 'guessed'
we were afraid the storm was 'going
to charge us.' Another was sure the
'Cap'n' was afraid of his shadow after
dark, begorra!'
"About ten o'clock word was brought
that the pickets on the west ha,d ob
served a small force of cavalry, but
thought they were Union men.
"An hour, later a force of two or
three squadrons was reported passing
distance to the south of our po
sition and going in a westerly direc
tion. Again, the pickets were not pos
itive but thought they were our cav-.
airy. :,-.:... ... . . - •
"The expected storm seemed to have
passed off to the north, though the'
staggering half-moon showed the
southwestern quadrant still dark and
threatening.
"The camp had settled down for the
night, but I was uneasy, and sat near
my tent trying to pursuade myself that
the reported cavalry was the supposed
escort which, had missed the road to
our camp and would probably pick us
up in the morning. However, I dirt
not feel reassured, and walked over to
the post covering the road to the west.
"Scarcely had I reached the picket
when we heard the tread of a horse
walking slowly up the road.
" 'Don't challenge,' I . whispered,
'We'll take him if it's a Johnnie.'
"We stepped into the deeper shad
ows, and soon a mounted Confederate
officer emerged from the dark bend of
the road, and was silhouetted against
the sky. In a moment or two he reach
ed the point commanding a view of our
camp, drew rein and sat not fifty feet
away, peering toward us.
"I cautiously took the picket's rifle,
and we sprang out into full view. The
officer started as he saw us, and wheel
ed his horse to escape. -■-■;■■
" 'Halt,' I cried, and as he dashed on,
with a quick aim, I pulled the. trigger.
Simultaneously with the report, the
picket struck up the gun, exclaiming,
'My God, Cap'n, you're shooting one
of our men.'
Bullet Ploughed Through Hat.
"I saw the officer's hat twitch sharp
ly as ■ the heavy bullet tore through
t. For an instant he swayed as though
HOX. JOHN J. JENKINS
hit, then spurred up the road before I
could reload. The quick blow of the
picket had saved his life.
"With the sound of his galloping
horse, we heard shots on the north,
and soon afterwards our pickets were
driven in by a force of the enemy's
cavalry.
"The camp was hurriedly aroused,
and our boys were ready for the at
tack. Bayonets were fixed. The men
were ordered to reserve their fire un
til the horses were almost on them.
"It had become very dark, and from
the flash of the lightning we saw that
the expected storm was at last upon
us. In a few minutes it broke over
us in all its fury, and as it did so
the enemy charged, yelling like devils.
On they came, riding as mad, and led
by the very officer I had so narrowly
missed. I recognized him instantly.
The Midnight Charge.
"We held our fire until they were
almost on top of us, and then along
the whole front of our triple line, blaz
ed our guns full in their faces.
"The crash was terrific. Troopers
reeled in their saddles. Horses stag
gered and went down with their rid
ers. The others broke in confusion and
dashed wildly past on our flanks.
"It was worse than nightmare — the
torrents of rain, the total darkness, in
tensified by the crashing, blinding
lightning, and the cursing, yelling
troopers, charging along over us.
"The flashes showed us the killed
and wounded strewn along our front;
and I took a dismounted captain pris
oner.
"Three times they charged us that
night, and as many times were driven
■ rp . the last time retreating south
ward. . - - "'" ' ' |.
"Vvhen the morning came, we bur
ied our killed side by side with the
Confederate dead. .
"My prisoner told me that the charge
was led by Fitzhugh Lee in person and
then I knew .who it was that I so
nearly killed with the picket's rifle.
"Do you know," said the Judge af
ter a long silence, as he withdrew to
the house to avoid the heavy gusts of
rain, "I've always been thankful to
that mistaken picket."
The Canada Goose.,
With the cry of "honk, honk," like
the warning of an automobile horn, the
hunter is warned of the approach of
the leader of a flying flock of Canadian
geese. On come the long-necked wild
fowl from their northern hunting
ground. They stream across the sky
much in the form of the flying -wedge
formerly used in football tactics.
Gradually the wedge closes together,
wa kin gone homogeneous mass of
black and brown, with sprinklings of
white. Usually the Canadian geese
stop flying about sunset, feeding on
eel-grass, sedges, roots of water plants,
and occasionally on small fish and
Insects. Even at times they will eat
the corn, wheat or other grains
dropped by the farmer in the stubble.
Supper over, they return to the water,
sleeping with heads tucked under
wings, waking only to start out again
In search of breakfast. These two
nights are so habitual with these geese
that hunters can easily reckon when to
take position in the pit in wajt of the
flying wedges.
Strangely enough, these birds, while
thrown into a state of panic at the ap-
THE POWER OF SONG.
AN INCIDENT OF LIFE IN LIBBI
PRISON DURING THE CIVIL
WAH.
How the Prisoners Sang the "Star
Spangled Banner," and There was
Cheering in the Streets of Rich
mond.
Taken prisoner while in charge of
the rear guard, on Stoneman's first
raid, near Richmond, Va., relates an
old captain of the cavalry, and after
various adventures, I, with 2,600 of the
prisoners taken at Chancellorsville,
was sent to Libby prison. The large
excess of prisoners on the Confederate
side procured us, most fortunately, an
exchange in a very short time, and
within a month or so I participated in
another raid under Colonel Spear of
the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry over
the same ground where I had been
lately led a prisoner of war.
We had passed but one Sunday in
Libby — 93 officers confined to an up
most story. About the middle of that
afternoon I chanced \to look around
the room. A half dozen parties
were playing cards, many were sleep
ing, several were lying on the floor
pretty sick, while one squad of a doz
en or more had organized a prayer
meeting. Not being a saint and per
haps not much of a sinner, I was sim
ply a "Looker on in Venice." The
leader was a captain of a Massachu
setts regiment. The meeting was
evidently dragging, the great heat and
perhaps hunger and our position not
proving conducive to much thanks
givings . •
The National Anthem.
Suddenly the captain started up, and
taking his place near the centre of the
room, exclaimed in a voice loud
enough to attract immediate atten
tion, "Let us all sing 'The Star Span-

exceptionally fine baritone, "Oh, say,
can you see."
Cards were dashed aside, the sleep
ers awoke, the sick leaped to their
feet; and like magic every one of the
entire 93 officers crowded to the cen
tre, singing with the greatest enthu
siasm. At least two dozen of the men
Had fine voices, and never did the
grand old words seem so like a mighty
anthem.
Waved the Old Flag.
Louder and louder swelled the sound
until the chorus of the last verse was
reached, when a member of a New
York City regiment, a regular Tam
many thoroughbred, reached his hand
in his breast and produced a small silk
flag, which he had, in come way, con
cealed when searched by the guards on
entering, and with a wild shout waved
it to and fro. Again and again was
the chorus repeated, and then sud
denly the captain changed to "The
Army and Navy Forever,", "Three

cows; this fact has often led hunters
to train oxen to walk straight into
flocks of them, the hunter hiding be

And yet, notwithstanding their wild
nature. Canadian geese are i often
domesticated and crossed with the
common barnyard goose. Sometimes
wounded birds are allowed to run with
the domesticated birds, until some mi
gratory Hock passes over the head with
its cry of "honk, honk." The call of
the wild is on again and the nursed
bird once more in a state of health,
rejeins his companions. A wounded
bird is often known to dive bene.ith
the water's surface, exposing only its
nns-rils, until all danger has pass'i-U.
Surprised, a flock rises suddenly and
apparently in great confusion, tbe
larcre birds get into one another's
way, bo that the marksman nas excel

the typical "honk, honk" they rise
against the wind until they are once
more in orderly array, the wedges fly
ing on to other parts,
Cheers for the Red, White and Blue."
Veritable cheers they were. Tears
streamed down" the veterans' cheeks,
the boys in the room below took up
the shouts, and three times' three
were given.
Hearing some cheering on the out
side, I moved cautiously near the
window — it was dangerous to go too
near— and saw all the guards in line
with their muskets pointed toward the
building, but, massed up and down
the streets, were hundreds upon hun
dreds of people, four-fifths of them
women, clapping their hands and wav
ing their handkerchiefs, showing by
their approval a most remarkable trib
ute to the power of song, and that love
for Old Glory still held a warm place
in their hearts and memories.
SOME GREAT DISCOVERIES.
The Chicago University Scores Some
Important Achievements.
Almost every day one of the pro
fessors of the University of Chicago,
the financial machinery of which is
oiled by John D. Rockefeller, breaks
into print with some new discovery.
They keep the world startled and won
dering.
During the past few years, for in
stance, the following epoch-making dis
coveries, among a host of others, have
been listed by a Buffalo newspaper as
Chicago University discoveries:
That kissing causes lockjaw.
That a dog never follows an unedu
cated man.
That tht Pennsylvanians are 'turning
Into Indians.
That Ireland was once a lake.
That primeval man had a gizzard.
Triat music is antiseptic.
That Adam caught fish with a club.
That love is a disease of the Medulla
oblongata.
That a cabbage contains more nour
ishment than twelve eggs.
That Boccaccio was a Swede.
That the American negro is gradual
ly becoming yellow.
That Columbus was a grafter.
That George Washington likel on
iciis and tripe.
That John D. Rockefeller is a greater
man than Shakespeare.
That t^e Junebug has seven stom
achs.
That Arabia produces more bullfrogs
than Bulgaria.
That marriage is a form of insanity.
It will take the world a generation
to ponder over the few propositions
here mentioned. The countless others
promulgated by the Chicago savants
would keep a thousand scientists busy,
even if they worked day and night, in
three shifts, for fifty years.
Certainly, Mr. Rockefeller's money
is being well spent. The fact that the
public laughs at the oil-born profes
sors and regards them as low come
dians is of no significance. The world,
it will be remembered, laughed at
Copernicus, Galileo and Sub-Lieut. Na

FORTUXES FOR BALL PLAYERS.
Friendly Rivalry in the Two Great
Leagues.
The great baseball battle which oc
curred a short time ago between the
pennant winners of the National and
American Leagues for the season's
playing recalls to mind that it was but
a few years ago that these two rival
baseball associations were clashing
tooth and nail in a deadly war of ex
termination and survival. It was then
that the American League, under the
leadership of Ban Johnson, made in
roads into the ranks of the National
League, capturing its star players and
enlisting them in its cause through a
rainbow of big salaries. Rival teams
were placed in Chicago, St. Louis, Bos
ton, New York and Philadelphia and
princely salaries offered to the players
of ability. There were, of course, suits
at law, and injunctions were sought re
straining the contract jumpers. One
particular instance of this is remem
bered I* .c case of Lajoie, Delehanty,
Wolverton, Orth and Townsend, one
time members of the Philadelphia Na
tionals, who jumped to the rival team
in that city. When injunctions were se
cured preventing their playing in the I
Quaker town, they were transferred to
the Cleveland and Washington teams.
The injunction, of course, prevented
their playing in Philadelphia, and
when occasion required that their team
should go through that city, these play
ers were always switched over on an-

It mattered not that the runabout
was second hand, and purchased at
auction, though at a ridiculously low
price. It mattered not that I had but
nine-horse power while Fred Wilson,
In his fine new touring car, had for

new possession set aside, to some ex
tent, at least, Fred's advantage over
me in the attack upon Miss Stend
man's heart. He had been taking her
riding on the Beach Drive, and I had
ground my teeth with futile jealousy,
until along came my wonderful op
portunity. I bought the machine,
though it was really beyond my
means. I simply couldn't help it.
When a man is in love, you know, he
is all kinds of a fool.
And didn't my breast swell with
pride when I whirled up to Alice's
house that evening, the second after
.my purchase, to take her in the
moonlight along that magnificent
five-mile stretch of perfect road? I
had made up my mind to tell her
that night all that had been in my
heart for so many apprehensive
hours— that I loved her, that I
wanted her for my very own— in fact,
that she was the only girl in all the
world for me.
-Oh, it is glorious to sit by the girl
you love and spin through the night
in a silent smooth-running machine.
I drank in the full joy of it. A dozen
times I was on the point of speak
ing. I had been practicing steadily
at the steering, endeavoring to be
able to manage the machine with one
hand, in order to have the other free

out— how she would listen in silence,
then look at me with sparkling eyes
and let her pretty head fall on my
shoulder; and how I would then put

all. It seldom does turn out just as
you plan it.
•'We will go clear to the end of the
Beach Drive," I said, as we slipped
away down Main street and turned
into the Boulevard. '"Then we will
come back by the Wood Road, skirt
ing the Zoo and ending up at Al
phonse's for a little supper." How
will you like that?' And she smiled
up at me so appreciatively that I
felt perfectly sure, for full half a
minute, that she was just as much in
'love, with me as I with* her.
It was so open on the Drive, and
there was such a stream of automo
biles and carriages that I deferred
speaking to her of my secret. It
would be better in the seclusion of
the Wood Hoad. So we talked gen
erally, and looked out over the water
at the vessels in the Sound, and ad
mired the beauty of the glorious
moonlight on the dancing waves.
Then, at the end of the beautiful
path along the water we turned ab
ruptly and entered the quiet and se
clusion of the great pine woods.
The road was rather narrow here,
and wound intricately through the
forest for several miles,, emerging
upon a broad plaza at the front en
trance to the Zoo. This road was not
much frequented at night, and I felt
that I would have ample opportunity
to express myself. I trembled in
wardly. The time was very near. I
must speak soon.
It was very quiet in the woods. At
intervals we could hear distantly the
baying and h^tvling of ihe animals
in the Zoo. OeasionaHy an ele
phant trumpeted, or a jaguar
screamed. We were used to these
sounds, but Alice was just, a little
frightened when there came a per
fect babel of sounds from the enclo
sure. She drew closer to me, and I,
relying on my skill, took my left
hand from the steering bar and slip
ped it gently behind her, though I
dared not take the liberty of em
bracing her. She looked up at me in
some alarm. "Suppose one of those
terrible beasts should get out and
come after us?" she asked timidly.
I laughed at her fears. "Why it
would be easy to run away with this
machine." I said. "And anyhow, you
don't suppose I would let anything

OUT OF THE
JAWS
OF
DEATH
I was going to say "precious head.'
but my mouth became suddenly dry
and my heart made violent leaps. I
was stage struck— love-frightened. I
had a sort of buck-ague. I- took
courage and found my tongue.
"Alice," I said gently, placing my dis
engaged band on her own, "I .want
to tell you Something that has — that
has been— has been on my mind
for ."
I think she understood what was
coming, but I got no further. In the
darkness, at the roadside, a huge
black bulk loomed, like an enormous
dog. A sudden terror shot through
me. The machine swerved sharply,
and I was compelled to use both
hands to steady it. I turned up the
speed a trifle, and then Instinctively
looked behind. A glance was enough.
The bulk had moved out into the
road and was directly behind us.
What could it be? A dog! A
my heart sank. I thought of the
chorus of unusual howls and roars
heard shortly before. I looked back
. again. There was no doubt about it.
behind us, loping easily with tall
switching in grace, came a huge
male lion. I recognized the great
shaggy head. It had escaped from
the Zoo, and was probably mad with
fright from the attempts of the
keepers to capture it.
A little faster, and still a little
faster. I did not want to turn on
full speed at once. Alice might un
derstand. Probably we could slip
away from the pursuer, and run into
town without her knowing the risk.
But as I turned my head a few hun
dred yards further I saw that my
speed was of no avail. The lion was
just as close as before, bounding like
a giant cat, as easily and as quietly
as a phantom.
But you can not keep a secret from
a woman. Alice turned her jeyes to
the rear, then with a piercing shriek
threw both arms around me and
clutched me In a most delicious em
brace, though I would willingly have
foregone the occasion.
"Yes, my dear," I said quietly. "I
know all about it I think we can
run away from him, though." 1
touched the speed lever again. This
was the iast notch. We were at our
limit, with a good two miles ahead
of us before any possibility of help.
The machine was now running stead
ily, with a straight road for half a
mile, and I let my left arm steal
around Alice's waist aiid held her in
a protecting clasp. I thought no
more about love and soft declara
tions. I knew only that here was
the sweetest girl in- the world, in im
minent danger of being torn to
shreds by a ferocious lion, and that
only a miracle, including steady
hand and head on my part, would
given even a ghost of a chance. I
stole another glance behind. Not
twenty yards separated us from that
relentless, blood-thirsty, powerful an
imal. Alice had sunk in a heap on
my lap. I leaned forward, hoping to
reduce thei wind pressure and add to
our speed, and prayed to heaven for
succor.
On and on we went What if we
should burst a tire or blow out a
cylinder? The thought was. heart
rending. Even at our speed the lion
was gaining. He was only ten
yards behind, lie had increased his
speed with mine, making twenty feet
at a leap. The uncanny part of it
was that he did not make a sound,
except now and then a low grumb
ling growl, as though resenting the
trouble he was put to in obtaining a
supper.
Far ahead I saw three lights set in
the shape of a. triangle. The top
light was brilliant and threw its rays
directly into my eyes. Thank God.
an automobile, approaching from the
opposite direction. I opened my
mouth and made ready to shout. But
what good -would that be. The other
machine would go whizzing by, and
we would be no better off than be
fore. Then I flinched and silmost
fell into the road, for right in the air
behind me appeared the gleaming
eyes, the foam-flecked jaws, the mas
sive-clawed feet of the Hon. He had
made a prodigious leap, and had we
been a tritle less swift would have
landed on top of us. But we shot
from under him, and as he descend
ed one great paw swept over the
seatback and wiped off half of the
leather covering. God, those claws
and their power. Another jump and
we would be done for.
The automobile in front was now
almost upon us. The deep-toned horn
sounded a warning. At that instant
I decided on a new course. We
were approaching a road crossing.
Taking the handle firmly I swerved
sharp across the track, just grazlug
the big car in front, and darted down
the side road. But I had miscalcu
lated, or my hand was unsteady. The
next moment we crashed into the
bushes at the side of the road and
came to a short stop in the' midst of
a dense clump of laurel. I -crouched
and awaited the descent of the Hon.
I could feel him in the air behind me.
I waited with a prayer on my lips.
Inst6a'd I heard confusion out on
the Wood Road. There were loud
voices. The machine was at a stop,
for I could see the lights through the
trees. Alice was in a dead faint, and
seeing that I could not help her at
that moment and that the beast tiad
disappeared I jumped out ami fan to
the* roadside. There stood Fred Wil
son's big touring car, w.ith the front
smashed in; there stood Fred and his
three companions; and there, in the
middle of the road, lay the lion. My
plan was successful. Following us
closely he had no time to dodge the
heavy car. lie met it head on.
There could be only one result
My runabout was not hurt, and af
ter a time, with Alice beside me, re
covered, though tremulous, we rode
slowly home. The 'supper was
abandoned. But in the quiet of Al
ice's dainty parlor, with no fear of
pursuers or intruders, I went on with
my interrupted story. And later,
with both arms around her, and her
dear face very close" to mine, we
planned our honeymoon.
Delightful— For the Guests.
There were many visitors that sum
mer at bis suburban home. He was :>
subordinate clerk drawing the large
monthly stipend of a hundred dollars,
but of course the guests were not cog
nizant of the extent of his income,
nor did that question appear to enter
their minds.
He was anxious to do every
thing in reason to make life in the
country endurable to his wife who
hated house-keeping under the best
of circumstances, especially in the
country, while the breath of fresli nfr
and communion, with nature were
proving his salvation from exhaustive
daily brain work, by which the cur
rent funds were supplied.
So he made these guests welcome
in every way, giving up his room at
times, changing his former easy hab
its, (but not his best clothes, as had
been his wont when he reached home
at evening) returning company calls
aujd thereby neglecting necessary
work on his place, et cetera. Of
course there were many extra ex
penses. A drive now and then, extni
servant hire, the greatly increased
cost of the table, the milk bill, the
butcher's bill, the bill for fuel and the
general wastage , all of which would
have been of small moment to a
man with a large income, but were to
him very disheartening as weeks
passed by and the guests made no
sign of departure.
But all things must come to an end,
and as the cooler days and evenings
of autumn arrived they said, "But in
deed, we surely must return to the
city. We bave staid months where
we expected to remain weeks."
And so they gave their host a for
mal handshakes and a perfunctory
good bye, while they kissed and em
braced the hostess and to her said:
"Never have we* been more char
minely entertained; you have done ev
erything in your power to make this
a summer long to be remembered."
And the poor clerk returned to his
desk and work, the house resumed its
normal condition, but as each pay day
rolled around he added his debits and
his credits, only to find that extra
hundred dollars persistently remain
ing on the wrong side of the ledger.
Whether it is ample compensation
for him to hear, when he occasionally
meets one of his summer friends, of
'the charming hospitality shown by
his wife," is known only to himself.
Doubtless so, since husband and wife
are one.
Uncomfortable English Hotels.
W. D. Howells, in Harper's.
With the aid of the two candles
which I lighted I discovered the grate
in the wall near the head of the bed,
and on examining it closely I perceived
that there was a fire in it. The grate
would have held quite a double hand
ful of coal if carefully put on ; the fire
which seemed to be flickering so feebly
had yet the weary energy to draw all
the warmth of the chamber up the
chimney, and I stood shivering in the"
temperature of a subterranean dun
geon. The place instantly gave evi
dence of being haunted, and the testi
mony of my nerves on this point was
corroborated by the spectral play of the
firelight on the ceiling when I blow out
my candles. In the middle of the night
I woke to the sense of something creep
ing with a rustling noise over the floor.
I rejected the hypothesis of my bed
curtain falling into place, though I re
membered putting it back that I might
have light to read myself drowsy. I
knew at once that it was a ghost
walking the night there, and walking
hard. Suddenly it ceased, and I knew
why. It had been frozen out.
Has Many Diseases.
In Bellevue Hospital, in New York,
there ia a man who should be the ob
ject of everyone's sympathy. His name
is Job Keeley and" his occupation is
that of a painter. A short time ago
he fell from a low scaffold and sus
tained such injuries as necessitated his
being taken to the hospital for treat
ment. There the surgeon found that he
had a slight fracture of the base of the
skull. After a further examination it
was found that he had tuberculosis of
the lungs complicated with bronchitis
His occupation as a painter had given
him painter's colic. He is not a young
man and his age had hardened his ar
teries — arteriosclerosis — also "old
man's eyes" — presbyopia — the opposite
of nearsightedness; he also has water
on the brain and his skin is puffed u.p
by air which has escaped under it.

QUEER DANISH SITUATION.
European and Diplomatic Gossip.
The late Lord Stanley, of Alder
ley, England, entertained abso
lutely fantastic hatred towards
everything American. Some few years
ago the American Society In
London was holding its annual
dinner on Independence Day, and In
vited Lord Stanley to the feast Hla
reply, typical of his dislike of every
thing American, was: "Lord Stanley
presents his compliments to the sec
retary of the American Society, but
can not conceive why he should have
been asked to a banquet to celebrate
an unatoned rebellion."
Countess Raben Levetzau, wife of
the Danish Minister for Foreign Af
fairs, is American born, as Is her mo
ther, wife of the Danish Minister at
Berlin. By the bye so much has
been said about the personal popu
larity of King Christian of Denmark,
that most people will probably be
surprised to learn that for twenty
years, until not many years ago,
there has been a deadlock between
the veteran monarch and the na
tional legislature The Liberals have
continuously held a majority in the
KING CHRISTIAN OF DENMARK.
Folkething, the Danish House of
Commons, but the King has insisted
on choosing his cabinet ministers
from the other party, the Conserva
tives. \
The representatives • of the
minority have conducted the routine
business of the, government, but
whenever they have had to nsk the
Folkething for special funds, that
body, wnich controls the official
purse, has thwarted thegi. The royal
residence in Copenhagen, the old
palace of Christianshprg, was de
stroyed by fire in 1884, and the feel
ing between the Crown and the legis
lature had been so bitter that money
hid never been appropriated to re
store it. For almost twenty years
King Christian lived in comparative
ly small and shabby quarters at the
Amailenborg palace until finally the
long-standing dispute was ended by
the King's recognition of the major
ity party.
It rmv not. Tip surprising that the
expatriated William Waldorf Astor
should claim for the first American
Astor— and inferentially, of course,
for himself— an ancient and distin
guished lineage. The distinguished
ancestor to whom his descent, is
traced is Don "Pedro d'Astorga. a
Spanish grandee of the eleventh cen
tury, who settled in France, where
his successors— a long line . of sig
neurs and marquises— changed their
name to Astorg. .At the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes. Jean Jacques
d'Astorjr. who was a Huguenot, fled
across the Rhine; Johann Jacob As
tor, the Waldorf butcher, was his
grandson. This information will, no
doubt, be of interest" to American
antiquarians. It is well known that
John Jacob Astor came to this coun
try nn almost penniless immigrant,
hailing from the village of Waldorf
in Baden. His descendant of today
speaks of him as a "peasant," but as
a matter of fact he .was the son of
the village butcher, and began his
career by working in his father's
shop— a -fact which it is not recorded
that he ever sought to conceal.
King Leopold of Belgium has con
ferred upon Mrs. Ellen M. Henrotin,
vice-president and acting president
of the Woman's Auxiliary Congress
of the World's Columbian Exposition,
the order of the Knighthood of Leo
pold. It Is believed that Mrs. Hen
rotin is the only, woman in this
country who has received this deco
ration. She was at one time national
president of the .Federation of Wo-"
man's Clubs, and is prominent in so
ciety. She is the wife of Charles
Ilenrotin, Belgian Consul in Chicago.
The Order of Leopold was founded
in 1832 by Leopold I; there are five
classes.
In selecting a wife. Serge de Wltte
the great Russian statesman, chose
a Jewess, one of the race which has
been treated so cruelly in his coun
try. Mine, de Wittp was formerly
the wife of a subordinate official, but
she secured a divorce and has been
very happy in her second marriage
in spite of the fact that she has never
been reoeivrd at court. She also has
been ignored by the leading society
women of St. Petersburg, notwith
standing the high positions her hus

7 Monroe Street Chicatf o. UL, U. S. A.A TALK WITH SECRETARY WILSON.
Secretary Wilson, as the official
head of the great family of American
farmers, views -with some consider
able satisfaction the abundant crops
which have blessed almost every sec
tion of the country.
"The harvests have been heavy," he
said, "and the farmers -will make
more money than in an average year.
The prices on farm products will be
lower, but the crops will bring the
farmers, nevertheless, more money.
Living should be cheaper, too. The
hay and grain crops have been enor
mous—probably record breakers— and
meat as a result should be more plen
tiful and cheaper. I say it should be.
The producer and consumer are so far
apart, and so much goes on in between
these two principals that it is difficult
to say just to what extent production
afreets the cost of actual consumption, i
A great deal goes to the middleman;
too much, I believe. It is a long and
devious pathway from the farmer to
the man who eats the things which h«
has grown. I gave out a statement
here the other day intimating that the
local Washington dealers were charg
ing in certain instances too much, and
a dealer camp 4it me with a wrathy
assertion to the effect that I did not
know what I was talking about* and
that he made a profit of only forty
per cent. " : v ,
Co-Operation in the South.
"I have been watching the South
with a great deal- of interest," con
tinued the Secretary. "They have ac
complished more in effecting an or
ganization down there to bring the cot
ton producer and consumer together
than has been attempted with any
other of our great agricultural produc
tions. The cotton crop, is a big one
this year .though not by any means a
record breaker. The grass and hay
crop is probably the biggest we have
ever had; our corn crop is probably a
record crop and our wheat crop is one
of the very largest"
"That is the order of Importance Of
these crops?" "■'
"No, I should put cotton third in Im
portance — grass, corn, cotton, wheat;
though of course, our meat animals,
taken as a whole, are more important
than any one. Why, the poultry pro
duction alone is worth 400 million dol
lars, a year — as great or greater than
the value of the wheat crop. We will
undoubtedly export some very fine
hogs this year — choice corn fed hogs.
Pork is our greatest meat export. A
quarter of a billion dollars would
hardly cover our animals exported this
year. I fancy, probably amounting to

send our hogs abroad and are eating
more mutton, veal and beef." ■--,
"The present condition and the fu
ture outlook for the American farmer
is a good one then, Mr. Secretary?"
. "Yes, things certainly look well,
generally; yet I believe we are very
near to a sort of agricultural crisis—
hardly a crisis perhaps, but an import
ant and radical change. The farm
hands everywhere" are leaving the
farm for the factories. Wherever
there is any manufacturing you will
find this to be the case.
The farmer has pretty nearly reach
ed his limit. He is doing about all
he can do with his hands and with the
most improved labor-saving farm ma
chinery worked by- good horses. This
bad condition on the farm Is going to
affect production and prices, and that
very shortly. It is impossible to say Just
what the effect will be, but a change
is coming. The farmer must have la
bor, but with the prices of farm pro
ducts as they are now, he can not meet
the wages offered by the factories;
therefore the farm hands are gradually
shifting toward the centers— the towns
and the cities." ••':
Mr. Wilson Not a Theorist.
"I would like, Mr. Secretary, to have
a message from you to the American
farmer for the coming year." . "
"Oh, I can never discuss things in
an academic way," remarked Mr. Wil
son, with a smile. "You will have to

refer to some of our bulletins."
"Well, I mean a few words of per
sonal advice to the farmer, to an indi
vidual American farmer regarding hia
work for next year."
! "No, I can not do anything with these
hypothetical cases of higner farm edu
cation."
"Well, then, what should a man do
with the manure which accumulates
on his farm?"
"He should put it on his land," re
plied the Secretary, now thoroughly at
home; he should take it out on the
land at once and not let it accumulate;
haul it out and spread it on as fast as
it is made. The ground will get the
good of it."
."Won't the ammonia evaporate and
the fertility be lost to the soil?"
"No, it has been demonstrated by
careful experiments that the hauling
out of manure is the best method. It
will go down into the grass roots. It
will not lose the ammonia because am
monia is produced by bacteria and
these bacteria flourish only under three
conditions, moisture, heat and oxygen.
There are three classes of bacteria
which must operate upon manure be
fore it is available for plant food. The
ammonia bacteria attacks It first; it is
th<»n converted by other bactpria Into
nitrites, and, lastly, by still other bac
teria, into nitrate, when the roots of
the plant can then take it up as food.
THE KITCHEN GARDEN
More Than Two Thirds of the Living
of a Family Can Be Raised.
If the farmer's wife could induce
her liege lord to contribute tue same
care, patience and labor next spring
to the kitchen garden ' which his
grandfather did during his day, there
would be perhaps a consideraule gain
in the household's economy as well as
much satisfaction developed for the
housewife. The old folks insist that

ety and excellence in fruits and vege
tables, due to many plant generations

of selection and breeding by the seeds
men and scientists, the kitchen
garden on an average is not so well
planted or tended, has less variety,
and on the whole is much inferior
to the same institution in the "good
old days" when grandfather was a
boy.
It is an oft repeated argument, in
every farm journal that more atten
tion should be given to the garden;
that fully two-thirds of the living for
the farmer's family, however large,
can. be produced from a good garden,
These Are

TypicaL
and that with thoroughly rich soil,
good seed, a well planned rotation of
garden crops and a medium amount
of hard work— a good wheel hoe will
reduce this last expense— a very small
area will produce a very large amount
Not only should the table be sup
plied from spring to late fall, but
large stocks of staples should be
saved for winter use. Of course
every farmer stores in his cellar po
tatoes, turnips, pumpkins and other
coarse crops, but there are many
others equally good and almost as
easily cured and kept which no
longer contribute to the winter's table
and have been supplanted by cheap
canned goods, in the long run expen
sive and usually very inferior.
Limas for Drying ;Pick Them Green.
Take, for instance, lima beans. If
these are picked and shelled when
green— the same as though for imme-
dlate table use— and then dried in the
sun, they will constitute through the
winter a delicious and wholesome dish
almost equal to the fresh bean.
The same applies to green corn, which
our grandfathers will tell vs 11 was a
staple winter produce, also easily
dried In the sun, having been cut from .
the boiled cob at "roasting ear" stage.
And, among others, okra or gumbo
makes equally as good soup In win
ter as when fresh in summer.
When it comes to canning and pre
serving, there is little real comparison
between the home canned product
and bought goods. It time is con
sidered as money, canned tomatoes
can be bought probably cheaper than
they ' can be grown and canned at
hotnel But how about the results?
If the farmer's wife should go
through the ordinary canning estab
lishment she would probably conclude
to do every speck of her own can-
ning hereafter and avoid setting on
her table sour green fruit, artificially
colored and sweetened with coal tar
products. ■ Y.Z" » • -■ -~ -'■■■'
With the supposed degeneration of
the individual farm garden, it is in
teresting to note that the professional
market garden, as an industry, has
tremendously increased.
The farm gardens, . "market * gar-,
•dens" 'and truck gardens" of today
are the producers of a multitude of
"miscellaneous vegetables" almost un
known fifty years ago. In the census
of 1890 the large increase in garden
products ■ was ' recognized, and ! a : sys
tematic count of their bulk and value
was made. It is possible, therefore,
to make a ten-year comparison of the
increase of such products, and this re
cords the remarkable Increases from
190 per cent to 400 per cent in the five
several divisions of the country. Tha
North Atlantic States had -a well de
veloped industry in "garden products"
before 1890. which accounts for the
relatively low increase. However, 190
per cent in 10 years, while the popu
lation increased only a trifle over 20
per cent, is amazing. '
