FREAKS OF WEATHER
FOGS, WINDS AND STORMS OF VA-
RIED PECULIARITIES.
The "Willlwau" That Spend* Itself
Upon Tlerra del Fuego-The "Foln"
Wind of Switzerland and the Pe
rocioas "Parga" of Siberia.
In mountainous countries, such as
Scotland, a fog usually forms at the
top of a hill and works downward.
The cold mountain top, cooling a warm
current of wet air, renders its moisture
visible, and this cold fog, being of low
er temperature than the air below and
therefore heavier, drops gradually to
the valley. Colorado, however, can
show an exception to this general rule.
There in winter the frost on the low
ground is so intense that a fog often
forms in the valleys and works slowly
up the mountain side. .This is known
by .the Indian name of "pogonip." ■
■ Peru has hundreds of square miles
along its coast of rainless country. ' In
this tract rain is never known to fall
from one century's end to another. Yet
the region is not entirely barren of veg
etation. Some parts of it, indeed, are
comparatively fertile. This is due to
the extraordinary fogs known as "ga
ruas." They prevail every night from
May to October after a summer that is
sultry and extend up to a level of 1,200
feet above the sea. Above 1,200 feet
rain falls.
The "callna" of Spain is a fog we
may be grateful that we do not have.
It Is a dry,' yellow mist which some
times hides the sun for days at a time
over vast tracts of country and makes
the sky look as though covered with
leaden gauze.
' Another peculiar freak of weather
we must be thankful to escape is the
"wllliwau." Tbls form of storm in
confined to that faroff Island Tlerra del
Fuego. The coast is indented with
deep fiords crowned with high moun
tains. Down from "their gorges drops
the "williwau." A low, hoarse mutter
ing is heard In the distance. Sudden
ly, without the least preliminary puff,
a fearful blast of wind drops upon the
sea. The water is not raised into
waves, but driven into fine dust For
tunately the shock lasts but ten or
twelve seconds, and calm follows at
once, for no vessel could stand such a
wind for even half a minute. During
the coming and going of a "willlwau"
the barometer may be watched to drop
a tenth of an inch or more and rise
again at once.
Similar in name if not In nature is
the "willy willy" with which Kalgoor
lie gold diggers are acquainted, to their
cost. "Dust devils," some people call
them. Half a dozen may be seen danc
ing harmlessly along over the desert
when suddenly one will dive into the
city and fill all the shop windows in
Hannan street with dust and sand,
blinding every passerby. The "willy
willy" is a thief of the worst kind. It
will steal the washing from a line or
the roof from a shed. In some parts of
the country wire ropes are anchored
over the roofs of huts to save them
from the attacks of these odd little
whirlwinds.
; Most people have heard of the "fohn"
wind of Switzerland, that warm, dry
gale which comes over the mountains
and in spring will melt two feet of
snow in a day. Its cause is most pe
culiar. The "fohn" comes from the
south. As it strikes the Alps it is wet,
like most gales which have crossed the
sea, but the south face of the moun
tains receives Its rain, and as it crosses
the summits it Is dry. The moving air
current Is also compressed and there
fore dynamically heated. As it falls
into the northern valleys in a cataract
of air It gains heat at the rate of half
a degree for every 100 feet of descent.
It usually blows for two or three days,
causing great suffering by its dry heat
and oppression. While it lasts the tem
perature is about thirty degrees above
the average. The "chinook" of Brit
ish Columbia and the western side of
the United States is very similar to the
"fohn."
! England has adopted the American
word "blizzard" for a gale with snow.
But the blizzard, however, must yield
to the ferocious "buran" of the central
steppes of Asia and the "purga" of
northern Siberia. To be caught in gales
such as these means death in a very
few minutes, however warmly clad, for
the very air becomes unbreathable, so
filled is it with spikes of ice drift
j "Khamsin" Is the hot wind from the
desert which blows out of the Sahara
upon Egypt The word means fifty,
from the idea that It lasts for fifty
days. The "khamsin" is terribly hot
and dry and sometimes brings pesti
lence with it
! Red snow we have all heard of. It
is. caused by a microscopic infusorial
growth and only occurs in snow that
has lain unmelted for a long time. In
Spitzbergen recently green snow has
been noted tinted by similar organisms.
I "Gold dust" snow has often been
'seen, but only In spring. At one time
it was a mystery how the surface of
'new fallen snow came to be strewn
with a shining yellow deposit Now it
is known to be due. to the pollen of
pine trees.— Pearson's Weekly.
Chicken Pox and Smallpox.
I The eruption of chicken pox has an
imperfect resemblance' to that of small
pox, but can never be mistaken for it
by the experienced eye. In smallpox
the eruption of papules first appears
on the forehead, the "papules" always
become "bladders," and the latter al
ways develop into pustules— that is,
sooner or later their contents get
changed Into pus. Then the center of
the pustules undergoes a peculiar sink
ing that in some measure resembles the
'depressions in a cushion or padded
chair where the "buttons" are seen. In
chicken pox there is no such uniform
ity of sequence, and the depressions are
absent.

WONDERS OF THE NEEDLE.
Beautiful Work of tne Artisans of
Former Centuries.
I The wonders of the needle were in
ancient times In Egypt, India, Baby
lonia and Phoenicia mainly lavished
by women on veils and hangings for
temples. Connoisseurs consider the veil
decorating the tomb of Mohammed at
Medina, priced at 10,000,000 rupees,
the most marvelous piece of embroid
rry ever made. Its pattern, a cunning
Interlacing of scrolls and arabesques,
exclusively delineated with rare pearls
and precious stones, produces, when
exposed to the rays of the sun, a stu
pendous effect of coloring, soft and har
monious and equal to the bold graceful
ness of the design. Linen, silks, leath
er and the richest stuffs were In turn
beautified with the little insignificant
tool, the needle. . ■
I Diaphanous Indian muslin charming
ly embroidered with green beetle wings
Is still renowned, as well as examples
of puiuted spaugles and artificial pearls
strewn amid devices wrought In gold.
But where Is now to be found the In
comparable Decca muslin, thirty yards
of which were once inclose*, for a tur
ban In an ordinary cocoanut lncrusted
with gems and presented by a Persian
ambassador to his master, the shah.
Other varieties known as Invisible
have also disappeared. The term orig
inated from the fact that when dipped
In water or spread out on the grass the
material was lost to the eye through
rts extreme fineness.
. The trained fingers have disappeared,
and through modern competition cus
tomers are no longer willing to pay the
real value of genuine hard work. This
superiority of eastern craftsmen over
their western fellows was recognized
centuries ago, first by Portuguese, who
were In the habit of Bending satin to
India to be embroidered by the natives
after European designs, a fashion
which at times renders somewhat puz
zling the classification of the marvels
of handiwork.
The French followed suit, since the
majority of the Louis XVI. court sets,
Including coat, waistcoat and breeches
In satin, velvet, plush or corded silk,
bo exquisitely adorned with delicate
sprays and admirable borders wrought
In satin and tambour stitches, are due
to the skill and industry of the Chi
nese, who have reproduced the French
devices with floss silk in such lovely
and fast colors, which still appear In
all their beauty, with a mellowness im
parted by time, which further adds to
their charm. — Ledger Monthly.
•BOOKS AND READING.
Reading is to the mind what exercise
is to the body.— Addison.
A home without books is like a room
without windows.— Beecher.
To read without reflecting is like eat
ing without digesting.— Burke.
Books are the best things well used;
abused, among the worst— Emerson.
Next to acquiring good friends the
best " acquaintance is that of good
books.— Cotton. ' . £:,
Some books are to be tasted, others
to be swallowed and some few to be
chewed and digested.— Bacon.
Half the gossip of society would per
ish if the books that are truly worth
reading were but read.— Dawson.
What is a great love of books? It is
something like a personal introduction
to the great and good men of all past
times.— John Bright
The three practical rules I have to
offer are: (1) Never read any book that
Is not a year old; (2) never read any
but famed books; (3) never read any
but what you like.— Emerson.
'What Makes Things Grow.
According to Maurice Springer, a
French writer on the subject, the en
ergy of growth is closely related to
electric energy and may be identical
with it At any rate, growth energy is
closely connected with the phenomenon
called osmosis— that is, molecular pres
sure due to differences of density in
adjacent liquid masses. Such molecu
lar pressure in the cells of the body he
believes to be the phenomenon that un
derlies the multiplication of these cells
in growth, and osmosis has been shown
by experiment to be closely connected
with electricity. The writer referred
to believes that we shall soon be able
to measure growth energy as we now
do heat or electricity and perhaps con
trol it so as to produce tall or short
families or races at our pleasure.—
Success.
Perfectly Safe.
A tourist In a remote part of Ireland,
having stayed the night at a wayside
inn not usually frequented by visitors,
informed the landlord in the morning
that his boots, which had been placed
outside his room door to be cleaned,
had not been touched.
"Ah, shure," said the landlord, "and
you molght put your watch and chain
outside your room door in this house,
and they wouldn't be touched."— Lon-
Auv King.
Quite Similar.
La Montt— Who is that old fellow
that is always hunting for you to buy
him a drink?
La Moyne— He claims to belong to
the upper crust.
La Montt— The upper crust, eh? Well,
I notice he is always short and always
dry.— Chicago News.
Plentr of Truth.
"Perhaps," ventured the unsuccess
ful contributor, "you didn't consider
my little ode true to life."
"Oh, it was true enough,'' replied the
editor. "I assure you there was more
truth than poetry in what you said."
What Is known as "goose flesh" usu
ally results from a low condition of the
system and is really a slight chill. If
yon have such attacks often, it would
be wise for yon to consult a physician.

MAN KILLING HORSE
THE WAY HE ACQUIRED HIS HATRED
FOR HUMANKIND.
*
It AH Begu -With the CrdVl Treat
meat Ho Received In His* Colthood.
Vicious Incidents That Marked His
Downward Career.
The development of a vicious horse
from an Innocent colt is described by
Powell Ford In one of the stories in
"Horses Nine." The colt's disposition
was first spoiled by Ignorant and cruel
handling on the farm of one Perkins.
Then he was sold, and bis subsequent
career is thus pictured:
In the weeks during which he trailed
over the fruit district of southern Mich
igan in the wake of the horse buyer
Blue Blazes learned nothing good and
much that was ill. He finished the trip
with raw hocks, a hoof print on his
flank nnd '.tooth marks, on neck and
withers. . Horses led in a bunch do not
Improve in disposition.
' Some of the scores the blue roan colt
paid In kind, some he did not, but he
learned the game of give and take.
Men and horses alike, he concluded,
were agalust him. If he would hold
hla own, he must be ready with teeth
and hoofs. Especially he carried with
him always a black, furious hatred of
man In general.
So he went about with ears laid back,
the whites of his eyes showing and a
bite or a kick ready in any emergency.
Day by day the bate in him deepened
until it became the master passion. A
quick footfall behind him was enough
to send his heels flying as though they
hnd been released by a hair trigger. He
kicked first and Investigated afterward.
The mere sight of a man within reach
ing distance roused all his ferocity.
Toward his own kind Blue' Blazes
bore himself defiantly. Double harness
was something he loathed. One was
not free to work his will on the de
spised driver if hampered by a pole
and mate. ' In such cases he nipped
manes and kicked under the traces un
til released. He had a special antip
athy for gray horses and fought them
on the smallest provocation or upon
none lit ail.
As a result, Blue Blazes, while know-
Ing no masters, had many owners,
sometimes three in a single week. He
began his career by filling a three
months' engagement as a livery horse,
but after he had run away a dozen
times, wrecked several carriages and
disabled a hostler he was sold for half
liis purchase price. -■
Then did he enter upon his wander
ings in real earnest. He pulled street
cnr*. delivery wagons, drays and ash
otiris. He was sold to unsuspecting
faraiore, who, when his evil traits
cropped out, swapped him unceremoni
ously and with Ingenious prevarication
by the roadside. In the natural course
of events he was much punished.
Up and across the southern penin
sula of Michigan he drifted conten
tiously, growing more vicious with
each encounter, more daring after each
victory. In Mnskegon he sent the driv
er of a grocery wagon to the hospital
with a "shoulder bite requiring cauter
ization and four stitches. In Manistee
he broke the small bones In the leg of
a baker's large boy. In Cadillac a
boarding stable hostler struck him
with an iron shovel. Blue Blazes kick
ed the hostler quite accurately and
very suddenly through a window.
Between Cadillac and Kalaska he
spent several lively weeks with farm
ers. Most of them tried various tam
ing processes. Some escaped with
bruises and ' some suffered serious in
jury. At Alpena he found an owner,
who, having read something very con
vincing in a horse trainer's book, elab
orately strapped the roan's legs ac
cording to diagram and then went into
the stall to wreak vengeance with a
riding whip. Blue Blazes accepted one
cut, after which lie crushed the aveng
er against the plank partition until
three of the man's ribs were broken.
The Alpena man was fished from un
der the roan's hoofs just in time to
save his life.
This incident earned Blue Blazes the
name of "man killer," and It stuck.
He even figured in the newspaper dis
patches. "Blue Blazes, the Michigan
Man Killer," "The Ugliest Horse
Alive," "Alpena's Equine Outlaw"—
these were some of the headlines. The
Perkins method had borne fruit
The Barred Road.
"There Is only one road to success in
life," said the man who had made his
lucky and retired.
"And how shall I know the road?"
inquired the budding young man.
"Well," replied the man with the
lucky, "you go right along this path
of adversity until you reach the first
turn to the right"
"Yes, yes."
"And you'll find a road barred oft
with a gate and a sign that says 'No
Trespassing.' Well, that's it"—Balti
more News.
Her OTvn Idea.
"Your daughter," said Mrs. Oldcastle
after being conducted through the new
ly finished wing of the magnificent pal
ace occupied by the Bulllngtons, "has
such a splendid vocabulary!"
"Do yon think so?" her hostess re
plied. "Josiah wanted to get her one
of them escritoires; but I made up my
mind right at the start that a vocabu
lary would look better in a room fur
nished like hers is even if it didn't cost
quite as much."— Chicago Record-Her

"That grocer of ours speaks the mosi

"You mean 'broken English, 1 mj

"I mean fragmentary," repeated Mr
Precise. "The man stutters."— Judge.

Extensive Kitchen Arrangements of
the Modern Hotel.
The kitchen arrangements of the
modern hotel are on the first basement
floor. There Is a chef, but so far as I
could see he does not cook. He is sim
ply a captain of the seventy-five other
cooks, who work In three relays of
twenty-five each. There is no range,
but a solid bank of broilers— immense
gridirons, beneath which are the fires
that never die. As for the 400 loaves
of bread and 8,000 rolls required dally,
the chef does not worry his mind' over
the patent cutten and mixers - and
ovens and staff of bakers needed to
supply the simple item of bread or con
cern himself with the quality of the
1,100 pounds of butter that are each
day required to go with it
I must not forget the item of eggs.
Eighteen thousand are required every
twenty-four hours. Boiled eggs- do not
get overdone. They are boiled by clock
work. . A perforated dipper containing
the eggs drops down Into - the water.-
The dipper's clockwork is set to the
second, and when that final second has
expired the little dipper jumps up out
of the water, and the eggs are ready
for delivery. There are men who do
nothing else but fill and watch and
empty these dancing dippers, and it
seemed to me great fun.
On another part of this floor is the
dishwashing, where great galvanized
baskets lower the pieces Into various
solutions of potash and clean rinsing
water, all so burning hot that the
dishes dry instantly without 'wiping.
Sixty-five thousand pieces of china
ware are cleansed in a day and an al
most equal quantity of silver. All
told, there are 300 employees In the
kitchen departments of this huge liv
ing machine.— Albert Bigelow Paine in
World's Work.
• SUCCESSFUL SMUGGLER.
The Schemes He 'Worked to Deceive
the Customs Officials.
"There is money In smuggling," said
the retired dealer in precious stones as
he leaned back, "but it is dangerous to
carry on the business, as possible sus
pects are carefully watched and, if nec
essary, traced j till they are finally
caught However, I knew one man
who pursued the trade of diamond
smuggling . for fifteen . years and was
able to retire to respectability. He
was buyer for one of the large business
houses In New York, and his business
sent him to Europe two, three and
sometimes four times a year. Every
time he returned he had with him from
$10,000 to $20,000 worth of gems which
he did not declare. /
"His trick was perfect simplicity
combined with ingenious boldness. His
hair was scanty, and at the top of his
head he had a most delightful little
bald spot Customs officers as they
came and went all knew him, and aa
they ' knew him . he . had a most pro
nounced wen where his other acquaint
ances saw a bald spot That wen was
a work of art, made of wax and gum,
and it contained two or three big stones
that would have been a find for the
men on the pier.
"The good cigar that he bad just lit
and allowed to go out held a few more,
and sewed in the handle of the grip
that he carelessly turned over to the
inspection of the officers were the rest
of them. He never varied the trick,
and he never lost Each trip was worth
a couple of hundred dollars to him and
a great many hundred more to those
who employed him. Now, that man
considered himself strictly honest He
would not steal a cent from an indi
vidual, yet he schemed and plotted to
rob the government"— New York Press.
The Reluctant Request.
Edgar— Ethel, I've left my umbrella

Ethel— Well?

SOFTCORE
Like the running brook, the
red blood that flows through
the veins has to come from
somewhere.
The springs of red blood are
found in the soft core of the
bones called the marrow and
some say red blood also comes
from the spleen. Healthy bone
marrow and healthy spleen
are full of fat.
'Scott's Emulsion makes new
blood by feeding the bone
marrow and the spleen with
the richest of all fats, the pure
cod liver oil.
For pale school girls and
invalids and for all whose
blood is thin and pale, Scott's
Emulsion is a pleasant and rich
blood food. It not only feeds
the blood-making organs but
gives them strength to do
their proper work.

KNOWING FIRE HORSES.
Bow They Wan to Start With, the
Jl»»er and Get tne Swing-.
The intelligence of fire hones Is well
known. A. j most knowing animal of
thtg kind la described by Sewell Ford
In "Hones Nine." The author says of
him: ;*-•
Other things besides mischief, how
ever, had Silver learned. Chief of these
was to start with the Jigger. Bleeping
or waking, lying or standing, the sum
mons that stirred the men from snor
ing ease to tense, rapid action never
failed to find Silver alert. As the hal
ter shank slipped through the bit ring
that same Instant found Silver gath
ered for the ' rush through "tho long,
narrow 1 •••o leading from his open stall
to the 1 \h, above which, like great
couchaut spiders, waited the harnesses
pendent on the hanger rods, t-j ■■ .
Once under the harness Silver was
like a carved statue until the trip strap
had been palled, the collar fastened
and the* reins snapped in. Then be
wanted to poke the poles through the
doors, so eager was he to be off. It
was no fault of Silver's that his team
could not make a two second hitch.
With the first strain at the traces his
Impatience died out. A sixty foot truck
starts with more or less reluctance, but
when once the tires caught the car
tracks Sliver knew what to expect He
and his team mates could feel Lannl
gan gathering In the reins as though
for a full stop. . Next came the whistle
of the whip. It swept across their
flanks so quickly that It was practical
ly one stroke for them all. : At the same
moment Lannlgan leaned far forward
and shot out bis driving arm. The
reins went loose, their heads went for
ward and, as If moving on a pivot,' the
three leaped as one hone. . --
Left to themselves, each bone would
have leaped at a different instant It
was that one touch of the lash and the
succeeding swing of Lannlgan's bnlk
which gave them the measure, which
set the time, which made It possible for
less than 4,000 pounds of horseflesh to
jump a flve ton truck up the street at
a four minute clip.

Knew Papa's Limitations. ,
She was a doctor's little girl. In her

it is something that might break it

to her mother, saying, "Mamma, when

of it to climate. The New England dl

FRIDAY APRIL 17, 1903
THE INDUSTRIAL SITUATION.
Not since the organization of
Amador county has the industrial
situation in this section been so be
set with difficulties as at present.
There is perhaps nothing more para
lyzing to business interests than a
labor strike. It is a declaration of
war between the forces of labor and
' capital — the employes and the em
ployers. On the side of the former
is arrayed the weight of numbers;
on the side of the latter is arrayed
. the influence of wealth and property.
If prolonged the struggle is as de
vastating to industry and business
as the desolation caused by an in
vading army through a fertile and
smiling territory.
The present calamity that has
suddenly overtaken the mining in
dustry of which Jackson is the center,
is appalling from any standpoint.
In round numbers nearly 1000 men
have been thrown out of employ
ment: machinery and enterprises
costing in the neighborhood of three
million dollars have been brought to
a dead standstill, except keeping tbe
shafts clear of water, a necessary
precaution against a total collapse
of these costly works. All the vast
business enterprises dependent upon
the mining, industry are panic
stricken. Property holders and
tradesmen are alarmed not merely
on account of the immediate stagna
tion of business, but more so on ac
count of what the future may bring
forth:
Fortunately the strike so far has
been unattended by any acts of
physical violence. It is hoped this
will continue* to the end. The " mine
owners have made no effort to. con
tinue work with non-union labor.
Neither side has evinced a disposi
tion to yield the vital points in issue.
Unquestionably the point that
brought about the almost total de
population of the underground wo^ks
was the issue of shorter hours. " The
men were dissatisfied with the long
; working day of ten hours, and the
hops of relief in this respect made
the path of the union strikers much
easier than it would otherwise have
been. This question, however,
might no doubt have been settled
satisfactorily without the extreme
measure of a strike. The, mine
owners have for some time had the
subject of shortening the working
hours under consideration. If, as it
is claimed, a miner can do as much
work in eight hours as he has here
tofore done in ten,- the owners would
have nothing to lose by the change.
■ A trial of a nine-hour day would un
questionably have been conceded by
the companies. If this resulted in
no diminuation in the amount of
work done, no increase of expense,
a trial of an eight hour system would
probably come next. The recogni
tion of the union, and reinstatement
of discharged men are different prop
ositions. The Ledger has always
conceded the right of workmen to
organize as labor unions for their
own protection. It has been opposed
to coercion of other employes by the
union element. It is opposed, to
dictation .of employers by labor
organization. It believes that in
dustrial peace and prosperity can be
lastingly had only by employers re
taining the utmost freedom in the
transaction of their business. The
situation in Jackson has undergone
a complete change within the past
few days. And we are compelled to
look upon the situation as it exists,
not as we would wish to have it.
From a non-union camp, it has been
transformed into a union town. We
must accept the verdict as an ac
complished historical fact, however
discordant it may be to our con
victions. With the entire business
community, we join in' the hope that
the unfortunate condition of affairs
may be speedily terminated.
A Rutland, Vt., jury, recently
awarded $2500 damages to a local
manufacturing company which
brought suit against one hundred
members of a labor organization, to
compensate it for losses and ex
penses growing out of a strike, and
the employment of detectives and
watchmen to protect its property
and non-union employes. The prop
erty of the defendants has been at
,'tached to cover the award. — S. F.

| The rock encountered in the cross
cut tunnel is extremely hard, having
the appearance of ; quartzite, with
stringers of quartz running across it.
The general character of tho rock
seems to indicate tho possibility of
another fissure, though at present it is
harder than any encountered in the
tunnel to this date. It is almost like
flint. We do not expect this to con
tinue long, as it may be the hard cas
ing of another ledge. •
Assays were made on the ore shown
where we cut the fissure at 600 feet,
presumably the Pina Vita, and small
values obtained. , .
: The assay samples taken from the
different sides of the tunnel show that
the pay shoot lies to the west. How
good this will be can only be deter
mined by drifting west on the ledge.
We have now, fairly good Indications
that pay shoots will be found both in
the Pina Vita and the Riverside ledges
on drifting west, and with good, backs
above.
, In the drift above the 200 foot tunnel
we passed through about 75 feet of fair
ore, when we came to the old Le Foy
shaft. We caught up the old ground
here, and run the drift through this
Bbaft Into solid ore on the east side
again.
We will soon make connections with
the old 110 ft. level, which is clear to
the main shaft. From this point, we
will connect with the central ore chute
if practicable, or make one in the main
shaft. This will open up all tho re
serves above the 200 level, and we can
then take out and mill whatever rock
we have in sight or -find along tho
drifts now being made.
The assays along this upper drift
west of the Le Foy shaft, show values
averaging about $12.00.
The samples were taken by our sec-

THE AMADOU , LEPGEH: JACKSOKj CALIFOROTA, FRIDAY, APRIL 17, 1903.
A Strike Thirty-Two Years Ago.
I Tho present strike will undoubtedly
recall to tho mines of. many of the old
timers of^Ainador county the trouble
that was precipitated £by tho Miners
Leaguo.in this county in' 1871, and we
herewith publish a synopsis of what
occurred at that time.
Tho Minors League organized as a
kind of mutual benefit association. ; li
does not appear that any unlawful
measures were at Hrst contemplated;
but organization gave tbe members an
idea of strength and influence. Mer
chants joined tho, league, for fear of
losing the trade of .the miners; politic
ians, , to make a few. votes; and the law
loss and desperate, to work against law
and order in society. In Suiter Crook;
it numbered about three hundred mem
bers,'composed of Irish, Cornishmen,
Aiistrians and Italians, and had a
membership of perhaps as many more
in other,' parts, of -the county. They
built a large hall, cost several thousand
dollars. Luke Burns, who had some
experience in similar associations in
Virginia City, was President, ,and-L.
J. Marks, Secretary.
• The immediate cause of the outbreak
was the reduction of twenty-five .cents
a day on the wages of tbe hands work
ing on the surface, in the Consolidated
Amador mine. After much discussion
a general strike was agreed upon, also
a determination to enforce it every
where, and> not permit- the working
of the mines unless at tho proposed
rates. The schedule of wages demand
ed by - tbe Miners' League made very
little advance over the existing rates,
but the right to make evan a small ad
vance implied a right to control the
working of the mines, and the mine
owners refused to accept the rates.
Members of the league to tbe number
of two hundred visited the different
mines, and ordered the stopping of the
work. They carried no arms that
were in sight, though according to
some reports they suppliod themselves
with clubs from tbe wood-piles of the
mills. It is now contended by some
that no threats or force was used: that
the miners went rather as a committee
of conference than as a menacing party.
They would not permit any work to bo
done, not even allowing an engine to
be run to keep the water out. The
mills at Amador, -Sutter and Oneida
were all stopped. It is true that some
of the mines, like the Keystone, Con
solidated, Amador, and others, were
paying, mines, and could have paid
higher wages and dividends also; but
other mines like the Oneida had never
paid dividends, but had always boon
worked at a loss. The wages paid var
ied from two dollars and a half a day
for top hands, to four dollars for un
derground men. There was no plea
that the wages were insufficient to sup
port the families, or less than were
paid- in other laborious occupations,
but it was intended to raise them to
the Virginia and Gold Hill standard,
where the expenses of living wore much
higher. The daily threats of destruc
tion of life and property showed the
existence of so much ill-feeling that the
Governor was invoked for uid, and a
body of volunteers, under General
Cnzenau, came from San Francisco
and camped on tbe hill near the old
Wolverine shaft. Thoy had' sevoral
pieces of artillery, and formed v reg
ular military camp, sending out and
relieving guards every evening for the
different mines.' The throats of life
and property extended to other parts
of i the county. It seemed that the
officers of justice were paralyzed. Tbe
newspapers of the county said little
about it, as if fearful that a word
might bring destruction upon thorn.
Tho ivsult was a general 'prostration
of business. The towns around the
quartz mines had been tho principal
markot for produce for some years,
and when a thousand or more men
were thrown out of employment and
the money which was usually paid as
wages ceased to circulate, the depress
ion in business was universal, produc
ing in some instances actual distress.
The soldiers remained in the county
for several weeks, and prevented any
destruction of property. Some kind of
concession was made which terminated
the siege, and the soldiers ''left, al
though the ill-feelingr engendered by
the operation remained for some time.
The damage to the county by this
affair can hardly be estimated. The
mines of gold and copper, as well as
other. minerals, require the aid of capi
tal to be made profitable. Capital must
be protected, or it silently sbuts itself
up. In subsequent years, tbe memory
of the Amador war diverted many
thousands from investment in the
county.

the dance that was advertised to take

The house was placed under quaran
tine, and no other course was left but
postponement. No other date has
been fixed for the dance as yet.
A Smashed - Wheel.
A collision occurred last Friday after
noon on the Kennedy road just out of
town, between one .of Piccardo's
freight teams and a buggy [ belonging
to Wilford Dennis. The buggy was
occupied by Mrs. Botto of Sutter
Creek, Charlie Parker and little Jack
Dennis, who were on their way to Mrs.
Botto's homo when the^ buggy met the
team in front of Dr. Schacht's house.
It turned out to the right, but not far
enough to allow the freight team to
pass in safety, as both wheels of one of
the wagons struck the buggy, and
smashed one of the wheels to pieces,
but fortunately none of the occupants
were injured. They were obliged to
postpone their trip on account, of the
disabled wheel. There seems to be a
difference of opinion between j Dennis
and Piccardo wherein the fault lies.
The former claiming that the buggy
had turned out as far as it could, and
that the driver of the team made no
attempt to swing his team to the op
posite side of the road. Dennis will
undoubtedly make a claim for damages, -
and we trust the matter will be settled
satisfactorily to both parties.
Accidentally Shot.
. The eleven year old son of Emanuel
Garibaldi was accidentally shot by his
cousin last Saturday 'forenoon i near
their home on the south' fork, about
four miles from Jackson. From Dr.
Eodicott, who was called to wait upon
the wounded boy, we learn that the
two Garibaldi boys, cousins, with an
other boy, were hunting for some stray
cows at the time of the accident. - The
eldest cousin was carrying a gun on his
shoulder which was full cocked, and
while in the act of raising the gun to
shoot a hawk which was flying over
bead it was accidentally discharged,
and the charge struck the eleven year
old boy in the leg just below tho groin,
inflicting a very dangerous wound
and causing a great loss of blood before
Dr. Endicott appeared on the scene
nearly an hour later, he being sum
moned as soon as ; the parents of the
boy were notified. The boy was de
lirous and very weak for several days,
but is now improving, and the doctor
has strong hopes of his recovery.
A Narrow Escape.
Monday morning .Wm. Finn, the
machinist in Garbarlni Bro's, shop,
had a narrow escape from serious in
jury, which was avoided only by the
coolheadedness of himself and Joe Gar
barlni. The two men were replacing a
belt that had come off a pulley on the
line shaft. Finn was standing on a
ladder, and while the pulley was In
motion he was using his hands to re
place the belt. One of his sleeves
caught in the belt, and his arm was
immediately drawn around the pulley
by the rapidly moving belt, and his
body was drawn up against the frame
work that held the shaft in position.
Realizing his perilous position he called
to Garbarlni, whose back was turned
at the time. . Joe took in the situation
at once, and- with what assistance Finn
could give him they pulled back on the
belt with sufficient force to throw off
the driving belt on the engine, which
of course stopped the machinery.
Finn was fortunate to escape with a
good scare and a tew bruises," for which
he is very thankful, as it might have
been much worse.
Tribute of a Friend.
j Arthur Greenwood was born in Ama
dor City September 14, 1886. The
greater portion of his young life was
spent In Jackson, where he was known
to all as a good, industrious boy,
studious at school, and always cheerful
and willing to help make his home a
pleasant one. For the past three years
he has lived at Middle Bar with his
parents, and attended the public school
at that place. The duties of his father
and older brothers have called them
from home much of the time since the
family has lived at the river, and upon
Arthur fell the duties of the house and
his mother's protector, which responsi
bilities were cheerfully taken up by
the devoted son.
It was his ambition to secure a good
education, and prior to his death he was
studying to take the ninth grade di
ploma examination, and after com
pleting the public school course he in
tended to work and save the money to
attend college. His parents and teacher
had hopes of a brilliant future for him.
His death has been a sad blow to his
family as well as the entire community
in which he lived, as he was universally
loved, and always had a pleasant smile
for his acquaintances and playmates.
His death was caused by heart failure,
provoked by impoverishment of the
blood, thus cutting down a young and
noble life. He was buried in Jackson
by the side of his twin sister Alice, who
died two years ago. r'.'
Tramping on the Lode.
The university students arrived in

walked from Jamestown, and stopped
at the various mines along the route.
The boys all express themselves as en
joying the outing, and were well
pleased with the trip. They left Sat

A STRIKE DECLARED
All Mines of Jackson District Under
the Ban of W. F. M.
The much-talked of strike came to a
head on Monday morning. All kinds
of opinions had been indulged in for
several days before the eventful time
came, as to what would come to pass.
It was well known that the strength of
the miners' union in actual members
employed at the several mines in this
neighborhood was not great. But the
question of what effect a strike declared
by the union would have upon those
not identified with the local organiza
tion was an entirely different question.
This was the vital point. Would the
non-union rcon continue work in face
of the strike. - If they surrendered with
tho rest the matter would assume a
very serious phase for the mother lode
mines. Sunday night ilie. union held
its usual weekly meeting. That was
supposed to bo the time when the - re
port of the committee appointed to
serve the demands upon the superin
tendents would be made.
- Early Monday morning notices were
posted around town, and in the vicinity
of the mines concerned, to the follow
ing effect: j .».:;■
Strike Notice — Notice Is hereby given
to all men of Jackson district that a
strike is declared on all mines and mills
of Onoida, Zeila, Gwin, Kennedy, ; Cen
tral Eureka and South Eureka mines.
M. W. Moor, of W. F. M.
W. D. Ould, Pres.
At the change of shift at tho mines
named, delegations of union men went
to the mines, not in large bodies, but
in squads of two or three, and inter
cepted the men as they were going to
and from employment. They were
stationed too at all trails and roads lead
ing to the works. .Web Smith, super
intendent of tho Kennedy, and J. H.
Hampton, superintendent of thoOuoitia,
objected to the invasiou of tho grounds
by the strikers— or rather thp union
forces who were determined to inaugu.
rate a strike. Most of the employes
were persuaded to turn back. Some
were interviewed at the Kennedy
works. The superintendent told the
men that they would be protected
while on the premises or at work. This
was not broad enough for the men.
They were informed that if they work
ed they would bo blacklisted by the
union. No actual violence was in.
dulgod in. The leaders were shrewd
enough to tell the men to avoid demon
strations of violence, to refrain from
carrying weapons; .promises of good
behavior were made to the, officers.
Nevertheless the impression was con
veyed that the path of safety lay in
quitting work. ._ Practically all the
underground tollers of the Kennedy,
Central Eureka, and South Eureka
quit work. Many did so simply because
they saw the others turning back.
At the Oneida superintendent Hamp
ton would not allow interference inside
inclosure. The boarding and sleeping
houses of tho company would accom
modate fifty men at least; they ~ were
guaranteed protection; twenty-four
men out of considerably over 100 re
fused to. go out, and went to work.
At the Zeila the pickets were posted
on the road and every avenue of ap
proach. But notwithstanding every
man reported for work at the morning
shift, except one. W. F. Dotert, the
superintendent, was exceedingly grati
fied at this result. The men were sat
isfied with their work and pay, and
showed it by refusing to listen to the
solicitations of the strikers,
All through the day the ranks of
the union forces were swelled by new
members. Common rumor says that
40 new men joined Sunday night; Mon
day over 100 are said to have joined.
The initiation fee of $3, it was said,
would be raised to $10 in a'day or two.
Whother the men were promised sup
port from the funds of the federation
we do not. Rumors are current on both
sides of this question. Seeing
the success of the move to get the men
out, it is not surprising that there was
a strong accession to the union side. •
In the afternoon, as the change of
shift at the Zeila approached, the
union men gathered in their hall on
Court street, and from there marched
through Main street, in double file
over 100 strong, to the Zeila works,
the object being to show sufficient
strength to induce the men not to go
to work. The strikers kept in the road
and sidewalk. They did not go beyond
tho large gate on the north of the
works. Every man going to or com
ing from the mine was surrounded and
made the fussilade of persuasion. Most
of tho marchers were Austrians, many
of them strangers in Jackson. Natural
ly the employes were overawed by | the
show of numbers. A few went on to
the mine, but not enough to justify
work, W. F. Detert was in his office.
He expected a demonstration of this
character, He watched the proceed
ings not only from inside the inclosure,
but also walked through the mass of
strikers lining the sidewalk. Under
ground work is suspended. Tho mine,
as with all the rest, is being kept free
from water, but how long this will con
tinue is uncertain.' There . was ore
enough out to run tho mill until Sat
urday, when it shut down also.
Tuesday the force at the Oneida was
reduced about one-half. On that day,
rumors were afloat that the strikers
intended to make a demonstration -at
the Gwin mine. Early in the after
noon they marched (from their hall,
the procession headed by the American
flag. By actual count 16C filod out.
These were joined by others at differ
ent points, and no doubt the force all
told was fully 200 strong. They set
out to tramp the whole distance, fully
six miles, over a rough road . They
had not boon gone more than half an
hour, when word reached here that
the management of the Gwin had an
ticipated the move by discharging all
the men, except enough to keep the
works in order. This completed the
tie-up of the mines hereabouts.
Nearly 1000 men are idle. Property
that cost fully two million dollars to
bring it to its present position is at a
standstill. How long this state of af
fairs will continue is the perplexing
question. It la being asked by busi
neas men "and property holders gen
erally. The outlook is really alarming.
On the one band it is claimed, that
Jackson hereafter is bound to be a
union town, and that it is better to
bow' to the enevitable, and look around
to see if there be not .'some common i
ground upon which the two interests
may meet and settle the difference.
The matter of hours is the great
stumbling block _ with the miners.
Scores of men went out on this score,
who would not have quit if this issue
had not been raised.
On the other hand, the matter of
submitting to the demands of any or
ganization on this question is a serious
matter to the mine owners. Altogether
the situation is dubious. Business of
all kinds is practically at a standstill,
In sympathy with the mines. Unless
promptly settled the situation will be
come more critical as time goes by.
The presence of 500 or 600 idle men is
a source of danger in itself. It must
be said that those at the' head of the
strike movement, are, ' by ■ advice and
example, doing all they can to prevent
breaches of tho peace. It is hoped
tLat they will bo able to -keep their
forces in control to the end.
WEDNESDAY.
lathis crisis events have followed
each; other with startling rapidity.
Wednesday morning brought develop
ments of ominous import. First came
the report that the South Eureka had
decided to quit, allowing the mine to fill
with water. '.This property has strug
gled ; along for fourteen . years. Its
shaft has been driven down twenty
three hundred feet, with exploration
drifts and crosscuts in ovory direction,
in the hope of developing a paying
mine. ' The prospecting In progress
when the strike was declared revealed
an ore-body of a better grade. * Stock
holders were encouraged. Now, their
hope has boon- turned to despair. To
face labor troubles in the teeth of long
years of unremunorative outlay, was
more than the company felt justified in
enduring. So a complete shutdown
has been ordered. As the works of the
South Eureka are connected with those
of the Central Eureka, it is doubtful
whether the two mines can be drained
through the one shaft of the latter
mine. J A burden Is thereby thrown
upon the Central Eureka— a dividend
paying mine— which it is entirely un
prepared to assume, adding materially
to the difficulty of the situation.
Next came the report that N. P.
Williams and other carpenters on their
way to work at the east shaft of the
Kennedy had been met by a body of
strikers and turned back. Also, that
Eb Brown, engineer at the Kennedy
old shaft, bad been stopped on his way
home from shift, and intimidated, re
sulting in stopping the hoisting of
water, and preparations for closing the
shaft. This news, although not sur
prising to many, struck the community
as a thunder clap. . It meant the begin
ning of the end. It appears that a
mob of strikers, about sixty in num
ber, stopped Williams and others. M.
W. Moor was spokesman. - In the case
of JJrown,-he met ten or twelve' union
men strung out along- the Kennedy
grade. ■ He was, on horseback, as his
home is near Scottsvillo, and he rides
to and from bis work. He was asked
to join the union, and refused. Then
he was told not to go to work; that
that would serve them as well as bo
coming a member. Finally he was in
formed that It would be better for htm
not to return to his work. Coming in
this way he naturally interpreted the
language in the nature of threats. He
rode back to the Kennedy office and
reported what had occurred. Told the
superintendent that he would rather
throw up his job than have to run the
risk of violence in the distance of sev
eral miles that he had to traverse in
riding, to and fro. Mr. Smith, the
superintendent, said he could not
blamti him for feeling that way; that It
was not necessary to report for work
in the evening as he had received word
from the officers to plank down the
shaft. He was honorably discharged.
Men were sent down the mine to gather
up the. tools to that end.
At the Oneida mine the managers
resolved to make a determined effort
to continue work.. A substantial fence
inclosed both mine and mill, also
boarding and sleeping houses. Super
intendent Hampton told the employes
he would keep them on the grounds
and protect them while there. Under
this arrangement he secured some
twenty-five men. He had a man
posted to keep out . intruders. Wed
nesday afternoon he came to town to
warn the strike leaders to keep off the
grounds; that if any effort was made
to interfere with the men inside there
would be trouble. Nevertheless a large
body of strikers moved in that direc
tion toward evening. They separated
into smaller squads, and took in points
at the Kennedy on the way. Superin
tendent Hampton was .aware of the
move. Sheriff Norman and Deputy
Jackson also repaired to the scene, and
overtook detached bodies on their way.
A few words were exchanged. The
strikers returned to town without at
tempting to assemble in force with
sight of the Oneida. Thursday morn
ing the working force was increased to
thirty men. ;
The two men, W. J. Nettle and Geo.
Troyan, who have been running a pros
pect tunnel into the Hoffman ground
for many months, were ordered to quit
Wednesday evening. This work has
been done by W. F. Detert individually
at a cost of between $200 and $300 per
month. It was not included in the
strike notice. The incident serves to
illustrate how readily movements of
this kind, even from the standpoint of
its supporters, drift to extremes.
The Zeila is one of the mainstays of
Jackson. It is now on the ragged edge
as it were. Mr Detert, the superiten
dent, who has contributed more toward
the upbuilding of the town and county
than any other man living, and whose
efforts in this direction have been poor
ly appreciated by an ungenerous pub
lic, is now, in this storm of misrepresen
tion and adverse criticism, actually
keeping the mine from being flooded
and ruined on his own responsibility.
The controling stockholders are in fa
vor of abandonment, while he is stav

the hope that the sober second thought
of tho community will offer some solu
tion'of the difficulty consistent with his
self-respect and convictions of duty.
Thursday the mine managers held
a meeting in Sutter Creek to discuss the
situation. The representatives were
firm and unyielding on the principles
at stake, but at the same time evinced
a spirit of fairness in treating with
employes. The following manifesto ex
pressive of their position was adopted:'
Art _ m *
The Miners' Union at Jackson on
April 13, 1903, declared a strike against
the following mines: Gwin, Zeila, Ken
nedy, Oneida, South Eureka and Cen
tral Eureka. -
We are informed ■by our employes
that at that time the Union had a very
small membership, and that few if any
of our men belonged to the same, yet
by threats and . intimidation the Union
has caused a ' great many of our em
ployes to quit work and have even
driven off sqme of the engineers with
the expressod intention of flooding the
mines and thus causing almost irrepar
able damages.
I The men themselves who work in our
mines have no grievance that we know
of; they have never asked for conces
sions that have not been granted; we
are now and always have been willing
to treat with our own employes fairly
and impartially and give them the best
pay and shortest hours our properties
can afford.
- The ore in the mines in this district
is low grade and many of our compan
ies are regularly levying assessments
contributed in large part by our resi
dent citizens. •
Unless our employes are afforded
protection by the authorities we cannot
operate our properties, and they will
have to remain closed indefinitely.
We therefore ask that law and order
be enforced by our law officials, that
intimidation and threats cease and that
every man who wants to work be per
mitted to do so.

Twenty-first Anniversary.
Friday night, April 10, Golden Star
Chapter No. 66, O. E. S., celebrated
their twenty-first anniversary at their
hall. These annual gatherings are
always looked forward to by the mem
bers of the chapter and their friends, as
their reputation for a royal good time
is established so well that a mere an
nouncement of the occasion is sure to
bring out more people than the
Masonic hall can accommodate. This
anniversary, however, was more than
those of former years. Not only had
the chapter attained its lawful twenty
one years of age and could look back
upou a childhood of peace, harmony
and prosperity, but something else was
"doing." It was known that two
worthy members, tried and true, were
one the eve of taking their departure
from Jackson, and to bid a fond fare
well to Mr. and Mrs. S. G. Spagnoli
was the last but not least event of the
occasion. While the gathering ] was
one of joy and good will, yet there was
sorrow in the hearts of all, particularly
the members of Golden Star Chapter
who had known the departing friends
so long, and it-was like severing family
ties to bid them good-bye. Mr. and
Mrs. Spagnoli are charter members of
Golden Star Chapter, and have given
their time and support to the ' order
that they loved through all these years,
and it seemed a strange coincidence
that they should take their departure
on the twenty-first anniversary of the
chapter's birth. It is needless to men
tion any praise of the brother and
sister at this time. Enough was dem
onstrated by those present to convince
all of the thoughts on every one's mind,
and "God be with you" was read on
the faces of all. A short and Interest-
Ing program was presented In an
interesting manner. Introductory
remarks were made by the worthy
matron, Mrs. Nellie Kent, followed by
an address, "The gVand feature of the
order," U. G. Spagnoli. Mrs. E. H.
Harrington, Mrs. E. Zumbiol, Mrs.
Morrow. D. B. Spagnoli, Miss Matson,
Miss Nettie Morrow, and little Emerson
Harrington enlivened the time with
music, songs and readings, after which
the Mandolin Club, whose members are
Dr. Carl Schacht, Wm. Penry, Frank
Valvo and H. Allan, rendered sweet
music throughout the evening. . Fare
well speeches wore made by Judge Rust,
R. C. Bole, J. W. Caldwell, Dr. Wil
son and Rev. F. A. Morrow, which
were feelingly replied to by the de
parting brother in behalf of himself
and wife. At eleven o'clock the ban
quet tables were spread, and of all the
good things to eat, words couldn't
begin to tell. Suffice to say, Golden
Star Chapter always does this part of
the program to a nicety, and this oc
casion was no exception to the rule.
It was after midnight before final leave
taking was said, and had our friends
known the effort it cost to say good
bye, it is doubtful if they would have
attempted it, and they well know the
esteem in which they are held by the
Masonic fraternity as well as all the
people of Jackson.

was received in Jackson Monday that

had denied the petition of the Kennedy
Company for a rehearing in the cele
brated suit between these two com
panies which has . been dragging
through the courts for the past eight
years. This settles the matter finally.-
There is no other recourse left for re
opening the case. Nothing intervenes
to the starting up of work on the
Argonaut property except the labor
troubles. The uncertainty of the situ
ation cannot fall to delay matters, as
contractors for supplies are timid about
getting out timbers and other needed
material. The "strike clause" leaves
the company at liberty to decline the
supplies contracted for in the event of
a strike. So the timber and lagging
business is crippled by the suspense.

The First Arrest.
Wm. Gardella, a young man who has
been assisting at one of the local boot
black stands, was arrested last evening
by Constable Laverone for disturbing
the peace. Gardella is in sympathy
with the union, and attempted to abuse
Herbert Tucker, a sixteen year old boy,
who did not agree with him on the
subject, and what might have been' a
serious fight was checked by the con
stable, and Gardella lodged in jail. A
complaint was filed against him this
morning. This has been the first ar
rest in Jackson during the past ten
days, which speaks well for all con
cerned, in the present condition of
affairs.

were married at the Catholic church'
Wednesday morning .by Rev. Fattier

left for Drytown. They, expect to
make Jackson their future home. -

but continued to grow worse. By the

once, and 1 after taking a few bottles am
fully restored in weight, health and
strength and can eat whatever I like.

A STRANGE LEGEND.
Orig-tn of a Carious Custom Observed
by Bulgarian Masons.
Nine master masons who were en
gaged in building a citadel in the time
of the Voi void Neagoe found on re
turning to their work each morning
that the portion of the wall which they
had completed tbe day- before had fall
en to pieces during the night and was
lying In a heap of ruins in the ditch.
Manol of Curtea, the head mason, in
formed his comrades one morning that
a voice from heaven had warned him
in his sleep the night before that their
labors would continue to come to
naught unless they all swore on that
very morning to Immure in the struc
ture the first woman, be it wife, moth
er, daughter or sister, who should ar
rive with the morning meal of one
or either of them. They all took the
oath, and the last man had hardly been
sworn when Hanoi's own wife appear
ed, carrying her husband's breakfast.
The oath was kept and tbe woman,
known in the legend as "Flora of tbe
Fields,'.' was murdered and her blood
and flesh incorporated with the wall of
masonry.
A curious practice of the Bulgarian
masons, (the above scene is laid In l*rrt»
garla), which survives to this day, tes
tifies to the vitality of the legend. To
insure the solidity of the houses the;
build they measure with a reed the
shadow of the first person who passes
after tbe digging of the foundation
has been completed. When the foun
dation is commenced, this reed is buried
under the first rock, usually the corner
stone.
Where Barley Is Cultivated.
Barley extends over a wider climatic
range than any of the other grains and
Is successfully cultivated over a great
er breadth of the globe than any other
cereal. It flourishes under the heat
and drought of the borders of the torrid
zone and grows sturdily and maturely
on the northern verge Of the temperate
zone, ripening and thriving under vari
ous adverse circumstances which wheat
is wholly unable to resist Barley Is
found in the Faroe Islands, near Cape
North, the extreme point of Norway;
near Archangel, on the White sea, and
in central Siberia between 68 and 59
degrees north latitude. In genial cli
mates, such as those of Egypt Barbary
and the south of Spain, two crops of
barley may be reaped In the same year,
one in spring from seed sowed the pre
vious autumn and one in autumn from
a spring sowing.
A Lost Combination.
The Chinese had all the grand secrets
of electrical discoveries more than 3,000
years ago, and they made use of the
magnet as loadstone long before that
Historical records show where their ar
mies were led across the vast plains of
the interior of the nation by a combi
nation of electricity as a combined
power of loadstones and some other
substances unknown to the Celestials
of the present day.
This form of electricity is among the
lost arts and must come to the front
with other grand discoveries within the
next few years. But not the great and
learned shall have the benefit of this
forthcoming discovery in electricity.

Contagions Disease* Among Plant*.
AU the fungous diseases of plants,
such as mildew, scab, blight, rust, rot!
etc., are contagious. The contagion is
carried from year to year in the dis
eased part, be it leaf, fruit or branch
The presence of any of this diseased
material in the orchard or vineyard in
creases the chance of the appearance
and spread of the disease another year.
Nothing is so destrucUve to the fungus
spores as fire, and all affected plants
or parts of plants should be cut out and
burned.
An Unfortunate Sequence.
"Rev. Mr. Stern's remark 9 over poor
John were bo sympathetic, I thought,"
said the widow's friend.
"Sympathetic?" replied the widow
"He said John 'had gone to Join the

"Well? 1
"Well, In his sermon several Sundays
ago he declared that the great majority
of people go below."

HOIiDING A CIGAR.
Points In «.- Han's Character the Act
Said to Disclose.
Did you ever notice the different
ways men hold cigars or cigarettes?
Did 3'ou ever observe how you yourself
hold one?
There are about a dozen different
ways, and probably no two men hold
theft cigars exactly alike.
A judge of human nature may pick
up iuterusUng points as to character
from Watvhing smokers.
One man will hold his cigar firmly
between thumb and forefinger. He la
usually a resolute, tenacious man,
strenuous or merely phlegmatic, as the
case may bo, but never h«y. His fin
gers are stumpy. s:*\" J '
Another man holds the cigar loosely
between his first and second fingers.
He is apt to be graceful, lazy, Irreso
lute, " a man of artistic temperament,
but not a hustler. His fingers are long
and tapering.
A third man will carry his cigar with
the lighted end turned In toward the
palm, the hand held scoop shape around
it He picked up that trick when
smoking on the sly as a boy, fearing
papa might break suddenly Into the
gnme. He is usually of a secretive na
ture and not marked by any special
tendency to frankness.
. A fourth . will hold his cigar awk
wardly, nervously gripping it and often
staring at it inquisitively to see how it
is burning. lie is not a "natural smok
er," nor is he apt to be what is known
as a "good fellow." He is usually anx
ious to conciliate others and has not
great force of character.
Watch the man behind the cigar and
see if all these character drawings are
not correct— New York World.
A CHEAP SQUARE MEAL.
Successful Scheme That Waa Worked
by Two Hung~ry Hen.
"One of the cleverest 'grafts' I ever
saw was worked the other day in a
quick lunch restaurant on Park row,"
said the Observer. "I noticed two men
talking earnestly just below the place
as I was going in to get my lunch. One
of them followed me in and took a seat
just below me at the table. A few sec
onds later the other entered and took a
seat just opposite his friend,' whom. he
did not appear to know. Tbe first man
ordered a very extensive dinner, com
mencing with soup and ending with
charlotte russe and coffee. He got tbe
very best that -the place could afford,
and his check for $1.35 was placed in
front of him. The other man took his
time about ordering, taking corned
beef and beans— lo cents' worth. His
check was placed in the center of the
table, between the two men.
"Number one ate hastily and finished
first x He got up, put on bis bat and
then calmly picked up the ten cent
check that belonged to his friend.
Without turning a hair he went to the
desk, paid 10 cents and walked out A
few minutes later number two, who
had been reading the paper, prepared
to leave and took up the remaining
check. He appeared greatly surprised
nnd called the waiter, asking for an
explanation. There was nothing for the
knight of the napkin to do but give the
man a new ten cent check, as it was
very evident that he bad not eaten
$1.35 worth of food. I suppose that the
two met outside and at the nest place

We Meet the President Easily.
One striking characteristic of Wash
ington life is the ease with which an
interview can be* held with the presi
dent, the members of the cabinet and
the holders of office. How they get
through their current work with all
these interruptions is. a mystery, but
they do. It is undoubtedly better that
a subject should be discussed de vivo
volx with the chief than that it should
filter through many channels, to arrive
as a more or less garbled version at
headquarters. The result bears good
fruit for things are often settled off
hand which take weeks and months in
another country. Also, It is human na
ture to take more interest in a person
ality than in a mere name.— Hon. Maud
Pauncefote In Nineteenth Century.
Cojarage In Elephants.
An elephant with a good mahout
gives perhaps the best instance of dis
ciplined courage— courage, that is,
which persists in the face of knowledge
and disinclination— to be seen in the
animal world. They will submit day
after day to have painful wounds
dressed in obedience to their keeper
and meet danger in obedience to or
ders, though their intelligence is suffi
cient to understand the peril and far
too great for man to trick them into a
belief that it is nonexistent No ani
mal will face danger more readily at
man's bidding.— London Spectator.

MAORI TATTOOING.
Tortures Which the Women Under-
go During? the Process.
I English explorers und scientists have
brought back a series of remarkable
ilivclinciis of Maori tattooing from the
interior of New Zealand. The most aa
tonlsliiug designs were found on* the
fnces of the women.
The faces and bodies of the women
arc so covered with these blue marks
that they look as If they had on a tight
fitting chintz dress.
, The instrument employed in tattooing
to obtain the deep furrows is usually
mude of bone, having a sharp edge Hke
a chisel and shaped in the fashion of a
garden hoe. Another style Is made of a
shark's tooth.
The tattooing of the women Is com
menced when about the age of fifteen
or eighteen and continues until they
reach middle age. Most of the masters
of the art are professionals, who go
from village to village and are highly
paid for their services. The pattern
about to be engraved is first outlined
on tbe face with a small stick dipped in
powdered charcoal, after which the
skin is gashed, and the coloring or pig
ment is Introduced into the cut flesh
with a stick dipped into the liquid.
; The coloring material used is gener
ally the resin of a certain tree, which
is burned, powdered and converted into
a fluid. '
The First Measure of Time.
It was the moon and not the sun
which first suggested to mankind the
circle of the year as a measure of
time. The sun exhibits no changes of
appearance, and his light obliterates
all tbe landmarks of the sky. A lu
minary which is the same yesterday,
today and tomorrow might give rise to
conceptions of perfection and eternity,
but beyond the alterations of day and
night it could suggest to men's minds
no abstract measure of time. But with
our bumble satellite it is far otherwise.
The regularly recurring phenomena of
new moon and full moon are . too
marked to escape the attention of the
most obtuse and unreflecting of sav
ages.
The motion of the sun may be com
pared to that of the minute band of a
clock, sweeping on hour after hour with
out leaving much record of Its compar
atively vast Journey. The progress of
the moon, on the contrary, may be lik
ened to that of tbe hour hand, which
registers the movements of its com
panion and resolves them Into twelve
well defined periods.
Two Views of the Same Question.
i A noted bishop In order to point a
lesson in humility sometimes tells a
story of a young clergyman whose first
appointment was to be an out of tbe
way and poor parish.
On his first Sunday In this new sta
tion the young man as be looked over
his wretchedly clad and Ignorant con
gregation could not help saying to him
self, with a groan:
"Dear me, what a dreadful thing it
would be if I should have to stay here
any great length of time!"
| At the end of tbe sermon a deacon
made a prayer. To the young man's
horror one part of the prayer was a
benevolent hope that "this ignorant in
experienced, barren pastor that ' bad
lately come to the parish might Im
prove and grow learned and fruitful in
good works, so that be would come to
merit being kept on there for awhile."
The Pillow of the Italian Peasant.
The Italian peasant girl as soon as
she has learned to spin and sew begins
to make her wedding trousseau. Thence
piece by piece it grows, and she has
put into it all her finest stltchery and
sweetest thoughts. As soon as she is a
bride she makes a bag of fine muslin.
This she begins to fill with rose leaves.
Bach year adds its share. When she
dies, perhaps an old woman full of
years, It is this rose pillow that her
bead rests on. In this calm acceptance
of and preparation for the great events
of life, such as marriage, and death,
there are time and soil for the blos
soming of fancy which we, stumbling,
hit and miss, through life, do not fur
nish.
Why Dnmas Laughed.
Sir Richard Wallace once heard the
elder Dumas laughing boisterously In
his study and was told by a servant
that Dumas was working and that be
often laughed like that at his work. It
turned out that the great novelist was
"in company with one of his own char
acters, at whose sanies be was simply
roaring." But this was yean ago, when
Imagination went band In hand with
animal spirits. It would be difficult to
Imagine one of the modern Intense,
realistic, analytical school so easily di
verted.
Tommy's Quick Answer.
"Tommy," said an uncle to his preco

"You certainly don't want me to grow
up and be good for nothing, do you, an
cle?"— Chums.

LIVER MEDICINBJ
A sallow complexion, dizziness,**!
biliousness and a coated tongue Q
are common indications of liver JJ
and kidney diseases. Stomach and fl
bowel troubles, severe as they are, H
give immediate warning by pain, fl
but liver and kidney troubles, B
though less painful at the start, are 9
much harder to cure. Thedford's &
Black-Draught never fails to bene- V
fit diseased fiver and weakened kid- B
neys. It stirs up the torpid liver 9
to throw off the germs of fever and m
ague. It is a certain preventive S
of cholera and Bright 's disease of g
the kidneys. With kidneys re- I
inforced by Thedford's Black- V
Draught thousands of persons have M
dwelt immune in the midst of yel- B
low fever. Many families live in ■
perfect health and . have no other ■
doctor than Thedford's Black- ■
Draught. It is always on hand for M
use in an emergency and saves I
many expensivo calls of a doctor. S
