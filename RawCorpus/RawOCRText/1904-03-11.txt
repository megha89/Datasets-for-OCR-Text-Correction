THE fiULLFIGHT.

. "I was born and reared In the repub

:. "TUis form of amusement was never

humane feeling." Yet lt Is a sport that
makes people become In a way devo

vated Is difficult to • break. I , have
heard Americans after witnessing their
first exhibition declare they would nev

habitual attendants.' " Except *on i rare
occasions our native women do not at

go when the proceeds are to be given
to some charity. ": ':',"-'' ' : "-
"One of the . curious phases of these

which the crowds start forth to view

HIS FOOLISH- REMARK.
A Statesman Who Was Made and tin-
made by Newspaper Men.
A certain young "man was sent to
congress.. He delivered a clever maid
en speech. The correspondents liked
him. They wrote him up in their dis
patches. His pictures were printed In
the newspapers," and ' anecdotes of ' his
life appeared in many a " Journals. ;., He
was" alluded' to as "a* prospective speak
er of the house, and it\ waSjgenerully
apfc'pd that he would do great things —
after he had^been elected for the sec
ond term; ;,:'"':' ..' : ■■' i V: •'■',"■ '.'

handed to the embryo speaker his con
stituents offered to excuse him.-
: ' "Oh,- no," he said, with affected care
lessness. "It's only one of those penny
a liners outside." . He can wait until I
get ready to see him."
The door was ujar, and the corre
spondent heard the remark. He bad
met such ' men before. He hastened
back to his ofllce, and that night: there
was a meeting of correspondents.
"What do you want us to do," asked
■one of the men — "roast him?"
"Oh, no," was the reply; "not that."
"What then?"
"Why, simply ignore him."

Unique Family Circle.
A small town In Bavaria can, boast
of what may be described as a unique
family circle. A shopkeeper resident
there Includes among .his household
three Hying mothers-in-law, each /with
a mother of her own; his own mother,
his .third wife and four daughters hi
their teens. The twelve women are re
ported to live on terms of the greatest
amity, and the shopkeeper himself, who
is fortunately In good circumstances,
professes to be perfectly contented not
withstanding that he Is thus the thir
teenth of his family.' * The incessant
banter to which he Is subjected he phil
osophically welcomes as tending to
ward the better, advertisement of his
business. ■ "- :
An Ultra Modern Child.
j Margaret's mother numbers among
her friends several schoolteachers, and,
although she Is not yet five; Margaret
has observed some things. . Not long
ago a family of klttensmade an entree
into " Margaret's homej and \ she was
most anxious to keep them . all. Her
mother, objected, on the ground that
they were all girl pussies and would
eventually grow up Into mother cats.
"" "No, they won't, mother," said Mar
garet very ' earnestly. "I won't let
them be mothers; I'll train them to be

The Silver Bridge.
One -of the customs observed at a
Bohemian marriage | feast is that of
making the bride cross a silver bridge.
The bride's father-in-law lifts her on to
the table, where she walks on two rows
of silver coins, at the end of which her
husband stands and receives her Into
his arms. ' Tho silver bridge ' typifies
the wealth with which her bridegroom
hopes to smooth her path in life.

THE; ABUSED OYSTER.
Fattened For the Vulgrar Crowd and
Deprived of II In Fine Flavor.
The oyster In his glory is a rich, dark
colored, shapely inhabitant of salt wa
ter. - He is plump," but not swelled up,
and_ has a delicious, Incomparable shlty
flavor which nobody who really, knows
him and has the taste . to appreciate
him would ever dream of spoiling with
crude condiments. '-'•'. But rarely .will the
oysterman send such an exquisite crea
ture to market.'; It is "not fat enough or
white enough for the vulgar crowd. So
he puts it in fresh, or nearly fresh, wa
ter to "fatten"— that is, he draws off
the fine natural Juices by a process of
osmosis* I and . substitutes therefor a
quantity of "water 'which distends'" it
like :a " balloon and ' makes ' it - Just as
tasteless. But it looks fat ' like a
scrawny Christmas turkey Judiciously
fed by • an . air j purnp.'^ Then it Is' put
before the American as an oyster/and
the American, who Judges his food and
drink largely by ' labels, pours over it
salt, pepper,; tabasco, Worcestershire,
horseradish or what not and thinks It
Is all right;! He "might as .well have
any ," sort of sea urchin that was soft
and puffy and wet as n vehicle for the
concoctions which jhe f used to make
himself . believe .that jan oyster tastes
like something.— New York Tribune.'
A DRINK OF WATER.
Why It Is a Gootl Plan to Take One
Before DrenkfitNt.
In the morning the stomach contains
a . considerable : quantity of ■ mucus,
spread over and adherent to its walls.
If food enters at this time the. tena
cious mucus will interfere to some ex
tent with the : direct contact between
the food and the stomach ■necessary to
provoke the secretion of gastric Juice.
A" glass of water taken before break
fast passes through the stomach into
the small intestines ' In a continuous
and ' uninterrupted flow. If partially
distends the stomach; it ; thins and
washes out most of tho tenacious mu
cus; ;it increases the fullness of the
capillaries of the stomach directly if
the" water is warm andtndirectly in n
reactionary way if lt Is cold. Cm re
must be taken not to take cold water
when the circulation, . either local or
general, ?is so feeble as to make re
action Improbable. We should'nbt risk
lt In an advanced age nor in the feeble,
whether old or young, nor should it be
taken in local troubles 7 like gastric
catarrh. In these cases -lt is best to
give warm or hot water. The addition
of salt Is very beneficial.— London Fam

Lt Qnall Are Scarce, So Are Turkey*.
I "I don't know 'whether; you ever no
ticed it, but it's a fact Just the same
that whenever we have a,year in which
.quail are scarce the same 'is true of tur
keys," said a prominent meat dealer
the other day. "Prolonged wet weath
er, in the spring or in the early summer
is" fatal to young quail and turkeys
alike.: Both are extremely, tender, "and
the weather has much to do with their
successful rearing. I ■ have watched
this thing for years, and Invariably a
poor quail year means a scarcity of tur
keys and high- prices." — Youngstown

Horse Sense.
t Biy maternal great-grandfather, Van

horße;jcaptured f rom ; the'; Russian ' In*
vaders^ln" 1814. v^The,'old' gentleman
was lame In one leg as the result of a
bunting accident but . withal sa f good
horseman , when {j once In ! the I saddle.
"^(Vhen . out "oh] his' trips ; In' the country
on business and coming home at night,
he would-, frequently" j fall asleep In his
commodious Cossack saddle. The horse
would make a bee line, for home at an
•asy.but swlftpace.T Arriving there, It
would 'rip at , the front 'door with Its
j foot until the ; watchman | would ' open
the "porch and take the old gentleman
, out : of ' the ; saddle. : My • grandmother
told me this ■ happened almost ' L every
;,week. ' " Horse ■ and master- understood
each other. . Not being able tor walk
▼cry.well, 1 . he would hunt from horse

and coming to a standstill . when one
of them, was 'on a pomt 1 the old gen

The "Weeping "Willow" Song.
Borne people have heard of the ballad
containing the words 'TU hang my
harp ■on a • weeping . willow tree," } but
perhaps lt Is not generally known that
the author was a young, man who fell
desperately . In ■ love with Queen . Victo
ria, at that time' a girl of - seventeen.
This young lover was heir to a baronet
cy, but baronets cannot approach royal
ty in the guise of a suitor, though lt
. took ' some time i before the romantic
youth could be brought to understand
this fact When at last be did so, he
sat down In despair and wrote the now
well known ballad, which was at that
time published In a London paper, and
then he emigrated to Australia. : j

The dog, the horse, the cow and 'even

able to walk as they do when out of

It seems strange that people have to

rance of so simple a thing as treading
water is remarkable. It Is without rea
son or excuse. There Is a popular no
tion, afloat that In some way the dog

further from the truth. The advantage
lies with man, who is provided -with a

Ancient Sports Among the Hebrew*.
I Pigeons :as ■ letter ■ carriers, tradition
tells . us, were "employed at the time
when Joshua invaded Palestine as me
diums of communication between head
quarters and camps In lands far off on
the other side of the Jordan. At the
time of the Talmud 'they were used In
amusing games. • The Talmud tells us
that betting was Indulged In at the pi
geon play. The owner of the pigeon
which reached first the point designat
ed was the winner. :•:.:
! Another play connected with betting
was the kubya. Kubya means a small
pot (Arabic kubela, small glass). The
kubya was a little pot wherein dice
were shaken and thrown upon the ta
ble. The dice were numbered as our
modern ones are. . Against these two
games the Talmud was in arms, and
their players were not allowed to ap
pear as witnesses before the bar. :
Columbus and the Gulf Stream.
I It Is curious to note in tho history
of the gulf stream how great Its influ
ence has been on the fortunes of the
new world. Before . the discovery of
America strange woods: and ' fruits
were frequently found on the shores of
Europe and off lying Islands. Some of
these were seen and examined by Co
lumbus, and to his thoughtful mind
they 'were confirming evidence of the
fact that strange lands were not far
to the westward. These woods. were
carried by the gulf stream and by the
prevailing winds from the American
continent, so that in part- the gulf
stream is. responsible for the discovery
of the new world. ■ ■ .
Washing OS the Russian.
. England Is always glad ' to get an
other citizen, but sometimes she goes
about it In a strange manner, accord-
Ing to the Springfield Republican. A
sailor deserted from a Russian battle
ship and Joined an. English crew on a
faraway Island. He told them that
he was tired of the rule of the czar
and wanted to become an English citi
zen. They were at a loss how to nat
uralize him, but finally each one threw
a bucket of water on nim and so wash
ed off the Russian.
A Tart Retort.
In arguing a case In an Hhglish court
the late Frederic Rene Coudert, whose
wit was rapler-llke, took occasion to
deprecate the legal learning of Lord
Chancellor Fltzglbbon, whom his op

took timid exception to this. "I have
read his opinions," he said, "and I
have often wished I knew as much law

'ITiliiKd Japan Dv If at.
In a book on Japan Douglas Staden
recounts the things that the Japanese
have not. .' They have" no « bread, no
beds, no boots and shoes, no trousers
for the men, no petticoats for the wo
men. . This . sounds ■ alarming, but both
sexes wear instead several dressing
gowns, one over the other-^the kimo
nos of commerce. In their houses they
have no windows,' no doors, no walls,
"no ceilings, no chests of drawers, not
even a washing stand, and the ward
robe is only a lot of boxes piled one
on top of another. la the kitchens they
have no range, no pots, no pans,'- no
flour bins, no flour, no kitchen tables.
But,: then,, they, have no tables or
chairs In the drawing room, and In the
real native house the drawing room It
self Is only, a" lot of bedrooms with
their walls taken down. There Is no
reason why you should find anything
In a Japanese hoase except mats and.
a charcoal stove for warming your fin
gers and the teapot and committing
.aulclde. Japan Is full of cherry trees
and plum trees, but they do without
fruit The cherries are used for the
blossoms and the plums for hanging

Colls. Tieir ProDer Treatment ani Core.
I Commonly, the first symptom of a "cold ".
is a chilly feeling, accompanied by sneez-
ing, or a tickling in the throat. ' The most
frequent of external causes are draughts,
wet or cold feet, or going from hot rooms
suddenly into cold ones. More frequently
there is an inner cause — namely the stagna-
tion of the blood caused by constipation or
biliousness. Almost the first symptom is
the feeling of cold in the feet and increased
discharge from the nose.' ■ .
| No one ever takes cold unless consti-
pated, or exhausted, and having what we
call mal-nutrition, which is attended with
i impoverished blood and exhaustion of nerve
force. : Tonics consisting of large portions
of alcohol, iron or cod liver oil do not bring
the desired changes in the blood, because
they do not enter the system and are not
absorbed into the blood, with the exception
of the alcohol, which shrivels up the red
blood corpuscles when it does come in
contact with them. We recommend the
.botanical extract of Dr. Fierce because it
contains no alcohol, and offers a reasonable
and scientific method of treating the blood,
by improving the nutritive functions of the
patient. The "Golden Medical Discovery "
accomplishes ' this, by first restoring the
enfeebled digestive organs, so that food,
the natural tissue builder, will be digested
and assimilated. ■ '

AMERICAN SYMPATHY WITH
JAPAN.
;. There is a small minority of
American citizens whose sympathies
are with Russia in the war now being
waged between that country ; and
Japan. This leaning occasionally
finds expression in the . press, al-
though it is undoubtedly true that
nine-tenths of the American people
are with Japan. We are told by the
pro-Russiau element that the United
States owes a debt of gratitude to
Russia because of the friendly atti-
tude of that government in our great
civil war. In' that desperate - strug
gle for national unity, Russia was
almost alone among the nations -of
Europe in wishing for' the ultimate
success of the federal cause. It may
be that selfish interests more or less
influenced the Russian people in this
direction— the fact that other
powers which stood in the -way; of
Russian aggressions were leaning to
the southern side of the controversy.
Be this as it may, it is beyond denial
that Russia was prepared in case of
international complications to rally
to the support of the United 'States
at tjhat time. The American people
were appreciative of this moral sup-
port at the time, and have not for-
gotten it up to ' the present time.
But we fail to see in this any reason
why the ' sympathy of America
should go ont toward Russia in the
imbroglio which is now being fought
out in the far east. It does not fol
low that we must support Russia hi
every move that restless power, may
make in its insatiable greed for
territory.'; Let those who, believe
that Russia has right on her side in
the present war justify her if they
can. : But certainly it is un reason -
able for this class to preach to those
who deem her course in the far east
nothing less than a bold attempt at
the' robbery of other nations, that
they ought to applaud the larceny
because of Russia's stand toward
America forty years ago. The truth
is Russia is, and has been for the last
hundred years or more, the most
grasping, insatiable power in the
world. Her greed for, expansion of
territory is in the nature of a mania.
It does not arise from the necessity
imposed by over-population, because
her territory both in Europe and
Asia is the most sparsely settled
portion of the civilized world, .and
will remain so probably for the next
hundred years. But the greed for
land afflicts the ; governing . class.
The more she adds to her national
domain, the greater her thirsts- for
further acquisition. By diplomatic
'cunning, by all the artifices of de
ception and chicanery, she has pur
sued the even tenor of her way ■in
making additions to her real estate
at the expense of other \ and weaker
nations. And notwithstanding all
her professions of fair treatment to
other jfeople in the way of open
ports and free commerce, it is a fact
thaWhereverthe Russian standard
is unfurled there follows, a studious
and carefully carried out plan to ex
clude foreigners from trade competi
tion^ It is Russian trade for Russian
people, not by: the fostering care of
a protective tariff, as in the United
States, but rather by a system of
oppression of those who have been
induced by her to build up industrial
interests' within her borders. She
first invites foreign capital to ex
ploit her undeveloped territories,
and. when these industries become
fairly established, the foreign arti
sans are slowly displaced byV.thc
Russians, and finally the owners are
also displaced in the same way.
That is the way her new territories
are Russianized. Russia has really
weakened herself by expansion. . She
has expanded until the immensity of
her land area — all contiguous terri
tory though it be— is a source of
danger rather than security. Japan,
the only progressive Asiatic nation;
is also the only power that has dared
to call her hand for the last fifty
years. She does this because she is
convinced, from* the settled policy
which Russia has followed in the
orient so long, that it is imperative
to call a halt in her career of in
corporating the whole of Asia in her
dominions.
In one respect the proceedings of
the board of supervisors, which we
present in another column, willbe
perused with more than ordinary in
terest by our readers. The Ledger
for years has denounced the practice
which has been followed for years in
Amador county, of the supervisors
putting in bills in their own names
forthe road work done in their re
spective districts, having the bills
lumped on the minutes, and drawing
the money therefor, the same as their
salary or mileage claims, in their own
names. We have contended ; that
'• -«■ >- .■' T ■.! 7\'<:;ni .'.-•;;
-.- . - •
the practice is contrary to law," and
keeps the taxpayers in the dark as
to how the road .funds are expended."
Its tendency is/pernicious|in other
ways. ;The k matter; was broucrht^up
before the'last grand jury, arid that
body recommended that the practice
be discontinued. [By the proceed
ings this month, it will be noticed
that the supervisors are abandoning
this illegal method of putting in road
bllls.^r Supervisors Burke and . Grillo
put in complete itemized bills, sworn
to by the] parties doing the!. work?
thereby complying with the law on
this subject. They are the new
supervisors, and it may_ be assumed
they were anxious to get away) from
the system from the outset of their
official career. '^'ThVold members^ of
the board r are'breaking~away gradu
ally. Moore's -name no
longer appears In the list'of payees
for road work.— -In districts one and
two the bills are partly itemized and
partly consolidated claims. ' It may
be safely predicted that all bills for
road work will soon be presented
and sworn to by the parties actually
interested. "For one man to. appear
on the records as drawing hundreds
of dollars for labor in one month, will
awaken as much comment as if the
bills were allowed solely in the name
of the ' supervisors as i ' heretofore.
The Ledger has persistently kept up
the agitation against an • innovation
of long-standing, and public senti
ment was so thoroughly aroused
against it, that it had to fall.
; The supreme court has held that
a county recorder is not entitled to
extra compensation for making an
abstract of ' mortgages, notwith
standing that the statute, says that
the supervisors may fix his compen
sation < for .such' work.' It is held
that the law giving the supervisors
such* power is unconstitutional.

The New Century Club held its bi
weekly meeting Friday evening, at the
home of Miss Ella Clute. J After a brief
executive session, those present spent
the evening in singing, playing games,
and merry making generally until J ll
o'clock, when all were invited to the
dining room, whore . a sumptuous re
past had been provided. ■', Cards, each
bearing a motto, had been distributed,
and emblematic answers were placed
upon the various plates. -' The first to
be seated was to receive a prize. This
caused much merriment, and Mrs. .)T.
D. Dillon proved the winner, while
Willis Boydston, who thought that a
too small lump of sugar rather.. than' a
peeled onion was the cause of many a
tearful eye, was the last to find a seat.
The object of this club is to , provide
suitable reading - matter for' its mem

month, and when . the treasurer has
sufficient funds to buy three books tho
money is spent for that purpose. They
now have about seventy excellent . vol

So Yon Want Strength! (
If you want to increase your strength
you must add to and not take from the
physical. In other words, the food that
you eat must be d igested, assimilated
and appropriated by the nerves, blood
and tissues, before being expelled from
the intestines. '• Kodol Dyspepsia Cure
adds to the physical. • It gives strength
to and builds up strength in the human
system. It is pleasant to the taste and
palatable, and the only combination of
digestants that will digest the food and
enable the system to appropriate all of
its health and strength-giving qualities.

Toe at Kennedy Flat.
The dwelling house belonging to Mrs.

chief machinist at the Kennedy mine,
was completely destroyed by fire last
Tuesday. The fire is reported to have
originated by the two" year old child
playing with matches, thereby setting
fire to some clothing in a closet. When
Mrs. Post discovered tho flames, they
had assumed such proportions as to be
beyond control. It was all she could
do to save herself and child. All the
household furniture was destroyed.
Mr. Post had only recently moved his
family to Kennody flat from Sutter

THE AMADOR LEDGER: JACKSON, JCAIiIFORyiA; 'FBIDAY^f MARCH 11/904.
The Public Graveyard.
Jackson is now, ' and ' has been for
many years, particularly unfortunate
in the uncared-for condition of its pub
lic burying ground... The cemetery is
not under the control of an association
or trustees. No organization was ever
formed specially to take charge of it.
It has simply been filled up with graves
without any regard to arrangement or
order. Family plate have been fenced
off in the same way, the size of ! the
plats In no way being influenced by the
probable needs of the family. • The pre
vailing Impression has been that the
'grounds are subject to no particular
authority, other than those who have
relatives buried tberein; ' that the
owners of family plats have exclusive
control over such plats, notwithstand
ing that they have never paid for the
ground, and have no title other than
that acquired by pre-empting the plats
for : burial purpose. It has been as
sumed that they have a right to cut
shade trees, or grant , permission to
others to do so whether for firewood
or other purposes. , The patients 'from
the hospital are being buried therein,
and to this cause, more than any other,
is due the present congested state' of
the cemetery. There has been no plat
of the graveyard made, and no register
or record of the persons buried therein,
other than the headstones erected ■ by
the friends 'of the ' decedents. ."-- In
perhaps the majority of instances
these headstones, or boards, have long
since fallen In decay, the inscriptions
entirely obliterated, and the mounds
that once marked the graves have dis
appeared. It Is now impossible to tell
from surface indications where the
ashes of the dead repose, and therefore
in opening a grave nowadays, such is
the overcrowded state of the cemetery,
the chances are strongly in favor of
breaking into an old grave, and dis
turbing, human remains placed there
years ago. As a matter of fact, it is
asserted that caskets rest one on top of
another- in many cases, either from
over-population of this city of tho dead,
or from lack of knowledge as to previ
ous interments. Such a condition of
affairs ought not to be tolerated in any
Christian community. It is a reflection
not only upon Jackson, but upon Ama
dor county generally. -It Is made | a
felony to wantonly disturb the remains
of the dead. There is little question
that to knowingly reopen an old grave
for\ the purpose ; of burying another
decedent above the remains . already
there is also a violation of the . law.
Overcrowding cannot be pleaded as an
excuse, it might be a mitigation of the
offense. If it is over-populated to such
an extent that . interments cannot be
made without serious risk of desecrat
ing existing graves, it is the business
of those having authority over, the
matter to close it against further bur
ials, and provide a new cemetery.
', It has been a moot question, who
has authority over the Jackson ceme
tery. This question was brought to
the front this week. The prevailing
idea has been that no one in particular
but everyone in general had authority
in the premises. But the thought that
in an" enlightened nation a burying
ground should be left at the mercy of
any one who might see fit to operate
therein, is repugmant to all' our con
ceptions of law and justice.'; Happily;
the law is not so defective. Last week
it was discovered that a , number of
trees had been felled within the grave
yard for firewood.. Some ladies inter
ested themselves in the matter to the
extent of trying to stop it. It has de
volved upon the' ladies to collect by
public subscription' for the repair of
the fences, and the payment -of water
charges, and it is no more than right if
tho growing trees have a commercial
value, they should help to pay. the
necessary expenses. On Monday the
women ] presented the matter to : the
supervisors. The . members went to
the cemetery to Investigate the condi
tions therein, but seemed disinclined to
interfere, claiming that it was . not
within their jurisdiction. Here was a
pretty dilemma. A public graveyard —
more populous than the town of Jack
son itself— without a legal guardian;
an orphaned cemetery as It were! They
were not satisfied ! with this view, and
looked up the law for themselves. The
board of supervisors had adjourned jj in
the meantime. ; The following sections
of the codes are conclusive of the whole
matter:
The public cemeteries of cities, towns,
villages, or neighborhoods must be in
closed and laid off into lots, and the
general management, conduct, and
regulation of Interments, permits to
inter, or remove interred bodies, the
disposition of lots and keeping the
same order, is under the jurisdiction
and control of tho cities and towns
owning the same, if incorporated; if
not, then . under the jurisdiction and
control of the Board of Supervisors of
the country in which they are situated.
Every person, who mutilates, disin
ters, or . removes ' from the place of
sepulture the dead body of a human bo
ing without authority of law is guilty of
felony. But the provisions of this sec-,
tlon do not apply to any person who re
moves the dead body of a relative or
friend for reinterment. 3

Another Bailroad Flan.
i D. McCall of lone, who has taken a
leading part in the Introduction of the
traction engine on the lone road, and
also in the lumbering . interest of the
county, is interviewing/the people. in
different towns in the interest of a
steam railroad from Sutter hill to the
vicinity of the Amador Lumber Com
pany's saw mill on Tiger creek. The
proposed road is 25 miles In length, and
the object in view in its construction is
the supply of the mines of the mother
lode region with fuel, logs and lumber
from the resources of Amador county.
As it is now this vast trade, amounting
to over $100,000 annually, is brought
from outside the county, excepting the
round timbers, and even In this respect
the margin is so narrow that, . as the
timber belt is pressed further up . the
mountains," these also aro likoly in a
short time to be brought fronrthe out
side. The effoct / has '. hoan greatly to
the detriment of the eustorn section of
the county, and the evil will doubtless
be intensified with the . lapse of time,
unless something Is done to restore this
important trade to Amador county.
In addition to the "timber resources,
there are vast deposits oT marble and
granite along the route of the proposed
railroad. . These are now dormant,'
owing to difficulties <of transportation, ■
but with cheap and rapid transporta
tion they would prove valuable sources
of wealth. The proposition is to build
.a narrow gauge line, the rails and roll-
Ing stock of which can be' purchased at
a low rate second - hand. The cost of
construction is roughly estimated at
$100,000, or $4000 per mile. With a
subscribed capital of $20,000, it is
thought the balance could, be readily
rajisbd by floating bonds. The plan
dojes not include building to lone. It
is not designed to antagonize or thwart
that project in any way. But it is felt
that to undertake the entire length of
nearly 50 miles, would bo too heavy, a
load to carry through. Furthermore,
the promoters believe that the opening
up of the eastern section of the county
is more desirable at present ' than ' the
construction of a road from lone to the
mineral belt. There is ] room for a
diversity, of- opinion on this point.
However, there is no question that the
line proposed would be very advantag
eous to Amador, county. It ought to
be encouraged. There is no danger of
the railroad business being overdone.
Vast sums of money are being sent out
of the county : for the purchase of sup
plies, which would be spent for wages
and material among our own people if
we had railroad facilities like 'the one
proposed. . The Ledger wishes Mr.
McCall and his co-workers success in
this "enterprise, believing that it is big
with promise of prosperity for the
whole county.

or stringer as a guide. At any moment
they are apt to run upon | a deposit of
black metal heavily charged with gold:
To-day J. Garbarini brought to town
some samples , of rock .. recently taken

DEFENDER ITEMS.
; Last week was a very rainy .week "in
this vicinity, but this week the weather
has been very pleasant. ; Green feed in
this section is coming on rapidly owing
to the warm rain we have had.
■ There has been quite a number " of
slides on the canal 'during . the heavy
rainfall of last week,, which gave em
ployment to a good many laborers. .
; Several of the miners at the Defender
were laid off last week. •
J. Porter & Son have finished their
contract at the Defender. They have
taken a contract to run the two hun
dred foot level twenty feet further, 1 . ■
Frank Burg is doing . some contract
work on the Tom & Dick quartz mine
for F, B. Joyce.
Lee Peyton and his brother Will are
running a tunnel on their claim. They
have about < fifty ■ feet ' further to run
before they open up their ledge.
The Kimball Bros, have closed down
their mine on account of surplus ' water
running in from old works. They will
start up again as soon as the rainy sea
son is over. - .
W. Q. Mason and his nephew, Frank
Mason, have V been running quite an

A Small Cyclone.
' A peculiar feature of the windstorm
of Thursday was the whirlwind that
carried away a section of the roof of
Sheriff Norman's residence, near the
brewery. • Mr Norman was at the barn
attending to the horses at the time,
and saw the cyclone approaching. It
came from the wind quarter, and looked
like a slender column of vapor or water
with a gyrating, motion. 'When it
struck the house it stripped off the
shingles from a space of about a square
yard, and carried the loose shingles in
a body to a hight of from 75 to 100 feet,
dropping the debris gradually over the
territory in .its' path. It was a minia
ture cyclone of the Kansas brand.
Mrs. Vicini's Condition Critical.
Word was received from district at
torney .Vicini early in the week that
the condition of Mrs. Vicini, who is
under treatment in the McNutt hos
pital In San Francisco, was extremely
critical. She was operated upon for
an Internal abscess or tumor. Upon
examination,' however,- it was "found
that it was impracticable to remove the
growth by a surgical operation. The
cavity was thereupon closed, the oper
ating surgeon announcing that to pro
ceed with the operation would almost
Inevitably result fatal. At last ac
counts received Thursday night it was
stated that the patient was resting
easier, and some hope Is entertained of
her recovery. The district attorney
will remain In San Francisco until the
present critical stage Is passed.

Obituary.
Benjamin Satchwell, a pioneer resi
dent of the neighborhood of Oleta,
died at his residence on the Ist
of March. . " Deceased was born in
Liecester, England, on the first of
March, 1819. Ho emigrated to the
United State's in 1816, settling in Illi
nois. In 1850 he joined in the rush for
California, and arrived in this state the
same year, and commenced mining on
Dry . Creek, near Flddletown, now
Oleta. In the fall of 1852 he went back
to Illinois for the purpose of getting
his family. They started to cross the
plains in the spring of 1853 with an ox
team, and . arrived in Fiddletown In
September \of that year. The same
year he moved with his family to a
ranch on Indian creek, where he has
lived ever since— a period of over 50
years. He leaves a wife and two
daughters, besides several grandchil
dren and great-grandchildren to mourn
his departure. Deceased was a loving
husband and father, honest and up
right in his dealings with his fellow
men, doing to the best of his ability as
he would be done by. "Even his fail
ings leaned to virtue's side."

AN OLD INDIAN LEGEND.
tradition 'of the Origin of AVhcat,
Corn and Tobacco.
: V "I have been favored with an Indian
tradition 'concerning .- the origin [of ; to
bacco, j Indian i corn and j wheat, which,
although you may have seen it before,
I shnll relate,"^ said the poet' laureate
of all the Pascagoulas. "„'."
■ "At 'some distant two Indian
youths,'-; pursuing j the pleasures of \ the
chase, ? were \ led ! to " remote and un
frequented' part of thej f orest, '.; where^
being \ fatigued ' and " hungry, I ' , they ■ sat
down to' rest themselves ' and . to dress
their victuals, f While they were ; thus
employed the , 6pirlt of the ; woods,' at

beside them. ..The youths, awed by^the
presence ;of . so superior ; a ; being : and
struck j with 1 gratitude 1 for : ,the ; conde

becoming their guest, : presented to her
in the most respectful manner a share
of their repast,' which she r was pleased
to accept : and upon which she regaled
with seeming satisfaction, v
VThe repast ] being ; finished, . the ■ fe
male spirit,' having thanked them cor

them that if they would return to* the

Coal In Folklore. "~
Probably, most policemen could have
answered the | question jof \ the ! magis
trate who ; asked \ a '- burglar .' in court
why ; he "carried ; about pieces of ' coal.
Among other, coal' folklore ' is , the , bur
glar's firm ; faith that *; the possession
of a piece confers good luck, and when
searched ;in ?. the ' police station 'i It is
usually, found in his pocket';- A ; belief
in coal as la, talisman Is said to have
been held by .the early ] Britons,' and It
Is- certainly j frequently found in their
burial • places j converted I into j personal
ornaments, such as beads,' etc. Believ
ers in dreams maintain that to dream
of coal is a certain sign of coming rich
es. Then, too, there is the speculum
or mirror of divination— that caused
such a sensation in the "sixteenth cen
tury—of Dr. Dee, . which .subsequently
formed part of the,, Strawberry Hill
collection. It .was | formed of [ cannel
coal, ' though the. doctor pretended to
have ■ received it from ; the angels.—
London Chronicle. .
S track Him Unfavorablr*
. Mr. Qaswell, who had come recently
into the possession of a considerable
fortune, had decided to . erect a \ large
office building and -was discussing the
plans with an archltectV;'
"As to the floors, now," said the ar
chitect, ."you would want them In mo
sate patterns, I presume T ■.-;
"I don't know about that," responded
Mr.Gaswell, dubiously scratching his
Jaw. "I hain't t got any ' prejudice
against Moses as a ma_n, and he cer
tainly knowed a good deal about law,
but when It comes to laying floors it
kind o' seems to me I'd rather have 'em
unsectarlan-like. Don't it strike you
that way?" :
Willing to Help Him.
\ j "My husband is so poetic,", said one
lady to another in a car the other day.
. . "Have you ever * tried | rubbin' his
j'ints with fcartghorn liniment, mum?"
interrupted a beefy looking woman
with a market basket at her feet, who
was seated at | the lady's elbow and
overheard the remark. "That'll straight
en him out as quick as anything I know
of, if he ain't got it too bad." <
His Drawback.
"They tell me," said the junior part
ner, "that the man to whom we have
been sending so many bills belongs to
a rather fast set".:-; .. ;
"Well,", answered the senior partner,
"be may belong to the fast set but he's

FISHING IN FORMOSA.
their nods Superb, but Their Hooka
Are Without i Barbs.
Three of us, ; two r Amerlcans and one
Japanese,'-; started j out ? In . y jinrikisba a
from^Talpeh, "i the . : modern ' capital ol
Formosa,' or, Taiwan, to go to the house
of : a wealthy * gentleman , about ; eight
miles. up the river. which runs through
the j valley _s of ; Talpeh^ < The] way J; led
through a beautiful and fertile "country,
the valley, covered with the second crop
of rice "and the hills with the '• famous
Formosa tea ' shrub. -After luncheon
and 1 after | photographing some t head
hunting : .savages c we r found ■ there twe
proposed. to flsh for salmon trout at an
altitude; less than 250 f feet above? sea
level and In . latitude .about 24 degrees
40 : ; minutes , north, •"•; practically Cln I the
tropics. The temperature "of the stream
was about 70 degrees or higher, and the
.water was well aerated:- 4 This stream,
from 60 to 100 yards wide, Is clear and
full of rapids and riffles.'
I•. We ' used Japanese : tackle— horsehair
line , and ■ leader, the j latter
consisting of one strand only; a bamboo
rod and a most delicate palmer, tied on
a small barbless hook.* : The rod Is de
cidedly Jgood and, weight ] for i weight,
is stronger ; and a; better; caster ', than
bur Jointed rod/;; It rarely "weighs over
four ounces (mine weighed about two),
but the linens practically worthless for
casting |as ''we ', understand ' the : ; term.
The ny Is perfect, but ■ the hook" lacks
strength," and \, the . flsh when hooked
may easily detach himself In a current
or an eddyor by fouling the line.- We
all know how It Is done from our expe
rience 1 with ] pjln ; hook and • thread In
the brooks at home." : : '
; The Japanese, however, have another
method of fishing which may be as new
to some of our readers as it was to me.
It is quite successful.^: They catch 'one
fishi mv any.;, way; they /can- and \ then
fasten -< the ? line ;; securely ;_ through its
upper jaw," passing it through the roof
of the mouth and out at the top of the
upper jaw. well ; in j front "of '-, the I eyes
and ; then ; attach through the body jof
the,flsh'not far, in front of the tall a
horsehair :, to \whlch jls tied 'a" 7 three
pronged barbless hook,' which trails In
line with the fish and a few inches be
hind,, while it Is slowly^ worked. up the
stream ~ t by t the fisherman. The" theory
is that other flshea, seeing the captive
moving along as though feeding' or per
haps ' spawning, Vwill pursue It and bes
come I Impaled on the hooks. .In point
of fact that does happen, as I: saw a
Chinaman ' take two fine trout in: this
manner. ■-:'/; ;
Our success with the flies was poor.
We got thirteen or fourteen flngerlings,
but we saw the flsh we wished to iden
tify caught in fairly good numbers by
the Chinese fishing, with decoys.—For

Woman* Aversion to Indexes.
; "Talk about the Inclination; to 'study
the envelope to discover the sender in
stead of opening the letter being a trait
of womanhood,", said a Brooklyn man
the other day, i "it Isn't in ; it • with ", a
woman's aversion to indexes."- Glve'a
woman" a book of poems like those of
Burns, for instance, and she'll turn the
pages ' for ' twsnty minutes J or^ more |to
find the piece she' is really after rather
than look in the index.',; Suggest the in
dex to her and she'll say, 'Oh, I'll find It
in a second,'; and away -she'll go,' turn

An Actor's Dlnnder.
A theatrical manager tells of an amus
ing and ludicrous mistake i made by a
young actor in a play.":"^-^: •- ~" IL r ~
i.The young actor bad up to this time
employed his , talents in enacting such
roles as called for no speech on bis part.
But In this play, he was intrusted with
the following line, the'only i words* to
be spoken by him during the entire
play:, . ..■
- ■•; "The king^ is dead! Long : live .the
knig!" " •' -..
'; ; The critical time arriving, It was ob
served by other players that the young
man who was to acclaim the new mon
arch in the words Just quoted was suf
fering from a dreadful attack of stage
fright.' His cue ' came,' : but no words
could he speak, so frightened was he.
Finally, ; however, : he : pulled himself
together and in desperation shouted at
the top of his voice: :
"Long live the king; he's dead!"

A' lawyer with ; Mac ■ prefaced ; to • his
name and a brother lawyer engaged in
a heated discussion. " The latter main
tained his position, claiming he could
find his authority and turning over. to

A More Important Matter.
. "Why," said the punctilious person,
"I got a letter from . the person you
have been praising, and there was ac
tually a capital in the wrong place!"
"May be so," answered Mr. . Cnmrox.
"But he- never gets , his capital in .the
wrong place in the market 'And that" s
more important"— Washington Star.
