Tit c Men and Women Who Curry
Chips on Their Shoulder*.
The really unhappy man whose un
bapplness is his own fault is the one
who is forever carrying "a chip upon
his shoulder/ Perhaps his happiness
is his unhapplness, for when he Is not
engaged in a personal altercation' he is
brooding over some fancied slight and
awaiting a favorable opportunity to
fclve vent to his wrath. '.';'•
The man with the chip on his shoul
ttcr is easily recoguize'J, and his society
j by wise people is carefully avoided/ He
j can go nowhere without trouble follow
; ing in his wake. If he attends a the
j ater he is either annoyed by .the usher
I or some one In the audience or at the
man in the box office for not having
sold him a seat bought long before he
appeared at tbe window. He is the
bane of the car conductor, and on the
railroad train he succeeds in embroiling
himself in a row with the brakeman,
conductor, Pullman car porter and Uhe
passengers. , Each flying cinder from
the locomotive is aimed especially at
his eyes, and he succeeds in stirring up
the spirit of mutiny in the hearts of
the travelers. ; , . ,;  r
There are some women similarly con
stituted, who manage to be in trouble
from the moment their eyes open in
the morning till they close. them in
sleep. These people are indeed to be
pitied, if indeed they are not cordially
hated. This quarrelsome habit of mind
can be so fostered that the pctulancy
grows to be a malignant disease and
leads sometimes to the insane asylum.
Parents who notice in their children
this fretf ul, ■ quarreling disposition can
easily find a remedy. They may not
agree to the measure— simply a good,
sound thrashing. Every one has beard
of tbe story of the child who was con
tinually whimpering and quarreling.
In despair the mother cried: "Are you
sick? What do you want?" Gravely
the child answered, "I think, mamma,
I want a whipping." She received the
whipping, and there was a marked im
provement in her temper.— San Fran

Perception of the Beautiful.
An instance of the Italian child's
quick, poignant perception of the beau
tiful occurred the other day in one of
the settlement libraries. A shy little
maiden, with a world of dream
thoughts in the depths of her dark
eyes, stood by the librarian's desk
waiting for Andrew Lang's "Gray
Fairy Book." But when it was given
Into her small hands all the wealth of
fairy lore between Its covers was for
a moment forgotten in contemplation
of the cover, a dainty design in gray
and silver. All thought of the story
vanished. Tbe child stood there ey
ing tbe book with a look that was a
caress, her hands Just touching the
binding, tenderly, as something of frag
ile beauty. And then, very softly, as
if to herself, she said: "I mustn't get It
the least bit dirty. It's so pretty."—

SIMPLE FISHER FOLK
THE NEWFOUNDLANDERS ARE EAS-
ILY IMPOSED UPON.
A Pathetic and Traffic Incident That
Illustrate* the Attitude of the "Up
per" Clauea— The Hardy. Courage
of the Outportera.
-,;t'St John's, N. F., lives by its fish
eries; nothing worth while is produced
Ihere, but, according to the unsophisti
cated stranger, there is a noisy and
vituperative wrangling over the wealth
that comes down from the coasts," says
a j writer in the WorWs Work. "There
are some few factories, \o be sure, but
they are too ingeniously managed by
half. ' For Instance, a certain brand of
tobacco, made at St. John's and-ex
clusively consumed by. fishermen,' Is
sold in the French Island of St. Pierre
for half what it costs the Newfound
land i^'bay noddle,', and the manufac
turers pay $15,000 yearly to the pro^
prietor ■of a rival concern to Induce
him to keep his plant shut down. At
St. John's, too, is the aristocracy of the
colony— merchants, middlemen, law
yers, physicians, officeholders, tricky
and abusive politicians and colonial
knights (the visitor may observe on a
signboard above a little corner store:
'Sir Thomas Morburn, Grocer. Cheap
Teas'). There is neither sympathy nor
mercy for the fisherman here, though
there is a most enthusiastic reception
for what he takes from the sea. He is
regarded as legitimate prey, is most
marvelously lied to before election and
ahused, ridiculed and reviled after
ward. But through It all he preserves
a humble faith In 'all those set In au
thority over him.'
"A doctor of the outports— the Inci
dent Is related because, though it may
appear an . extraordinary case, it yet
aptly indicates what has for years
been tbe attitude of the 'upper' classes
toward the fishermen, without whom
Newfoundland would lie waste and
deserted, the shame of the fair earth—
a doctor of the outports was once call
ed to a little white cottage where
three children lay sick of diphtheria.
He was the family physician— that Is
to say, the fisherman paid him so
much by the year for medical attend
ance. But the injection of antitoxin
is a 'surgical operation' and therefore
not provided for by the annual fee.
"'This,' said the doctor, 'will cost
you $2 an injection, John.'
" 'Oh, lss, zur!' was the ready reply.
'I'll pay you, cur. Go on, zur.*
" 'But you know my rule, John— no
pay, no work. I can't break It for you,
you know, or I'd have to break it for
half the coast*
" 'Oh, aye I 'Tis all right I wants
un cured. I'll pay you when I sells me
fish.'
" "But you know my rule, John— cash
down.' v
"The fisherman had but $4, no more.
Nor could he obtain any more, though
tbe doctor gave him ample time. lam
sure that he loved his children dearly,
bur," unfortunately, he had no more
than $4, and there was no other doctor
for fifty miles up and down the coast
" 'Four dollars,' said the doctor, 'two
children. Which ones shall It be,
John?'
"Which ones? Why, of course, after
all, the doctor had himself to make the
choice. John couldn't So tbe doctor
chose the 'handiest' ones. The other
one died.
" 'Well,' said John, unresentfully, the
day after the funeral, 'I s'pose a doc
tor have a right t' be paid for what be
does. But' much puzzled, ' 'tis kind o*
queer 1'
"The Newfoundland outporters are
hardy, courageous, boldly adventurous,
simple lived, God fearing, warm heart
ed—a physically splendid race of men.
Cowards and weaklings have for four
hundred years been the unfit of the
place; they occur, of course, in tbe best
regulated families, but do not long sur
vive, for exposure kills off the weak
lings, and in the midst of many dan
gers the cowards lose their lives. Chil
dren learn to sail a punt at six or seven
years old, and at every age they are en
couraged to play at tbe highly danger
ous game (called copying) of prancing
about on floating ice. Tbe skill ac
quired in leaping from one sinking
block- to another would make tbe
trumpeted river driver look like a
blundering child. As men, they know
their punts as Intimately as a cowboy
knows bis horse, and they will say of
their boats in a gale, 'I thought she'd
not live through It t'day,' with tbe
same unconcern that a cowboy might
say of his horse, 'He nearly throwed
me that time.' The race Is truly hardy
and courageous. It waa John Butt,
with a broken collar bone and a spilt
forehead to show for it, who survived
two wild, snowy nights and a day on a
twenty foot ice pan, over which for
many hours broke great seas, heavy
with Jagged fragments of Ice, and it
was a reckless Green bay skipper who
let the wind blow the masts out of his
schooner rather than reef ber, because
be bad been told that his crew thought
him 'nervous'— a mad sort of courage,
to be sure, but proof positive for all
time that he was no coward."

PfT BROW WOMEN.
Hard Lot of Female Worker* Abont
Ens-Uah Coal Mines.
Pit brow women are among the most
remarkable women workers in the
world. They work as hard as men and
dress almost like them. Five thousand
»f these women find employment In
Lancashire, England, in the coal mines.
Their work lies on the pit brow at the
surface and not down below. Once wo
men were employed In the coal seams,
but in 1842, in the face of great oppo
sition from colliery owners, an act was
passed prohibiting women and children
from being employed below the surface
in coal mines.
At present the duties of the pit brow
women consist in dealing with the coal
as It comes up the shaft to the pit head.
When tbe cargo reaches the top they
haul out the wagons, which contain
several hundredweight , of coal each,
and run them on the rails to a sort of
tipping machine, which shoots the coal
down below to theTscreen of the* rid-"
dllng machine. Among the other du
ties of the women is tbe leveling of the
coal on the wagons which receive It as
it drops from the screen.
They start work at 6 o'clock In the
morning and finish at 4 In the after
noon. They receive 2 shillings or less a
day, and men that do the same work
get 4 shillings. Their costume consists
of trousers and clogs and often enough
a cape which has at one time been
worn by a brother. When going to
and from work the girls and women
wear petticoats, which they roll up
around tbe waist while engaged on
the pit brow. The hair Is closely cov
ered with a handkerchief, on top of
which is a soft bonnet
A Valley of Death In Bolivia,
. There is a valley in Bolivia, South
America, which might well be called
the Valley of the Shadow of Death. It
has been Inhabited for an Indefinite
period of years by the Kanaa Indians,
who are kindred to the various South
American tribes and number now only
a few hundred souls. That they were
once a very powerful tribe is indicated
by the condition of the land which
they as a tribe still Inhabit One can
not travel any distance through their
land without coming upon the old and
forsaken burial grounds of the Kanaa
dead. These places cannot be called
graveyards, for the bodies are not
buried, but rather placed upon elevat
ed platforms, wrapped In the garments
of death and bound to the crossbeams
that they may not be displaced.
In one of these burial grounds there
will be probably fifty high skeleton
platforms and on each will He from
three to five of the Kanaa dead. The
air In that part of Bolivia Is very pure
and preservative, for It Is one of the
highest plateaus of the continent, al
though Kanaa valley Is Just a little
below the plateau's height A traveler
passing through that land at night and
by moonlight would be awestricken at
the gloomy vision those graveyards

An Affair of Letters.
We are much surprised at meeting
little Polly Contossel, formerly of Bow
ersville, In England. ./-••,
"Why, Polly!" we say. "How Is It
we find you here?"
"Polly!" she repeats, with a dignity
we never knew she possessed. ','Lady
Oledebts, if you please."
An apology on our part establishes
friendly relations once more, and she
tells us that she really has won and
wedded Lord Oledebts and that her fa
ther's dollars are being expended in the
refurbishing of the Oledebts castle.
"But," we say, "It was rumored In
Bowersville that you were hesitating
in your choice between three honest
farmer lads in the vicinity. How was
it, then, that you married his lordship?"
"Oh," she titters, "he came to Bow
ersville one day. j When I saw him I
dropped my eyes and he began dropping
bis h's, and it wasn't long until be In
duced me to drop my J's, and now we
are both making papa drop bis v's and

He Won Her.
"She has promised to marry you, has
she? Did she accept you right off?"
"Oh, no. I had to, propose to her
four times."
"Four times! . Gracious, but you were'
persevering! What did she say the
first time?"
"She said If there wasn't another
man in the world but me she wouldn't
marry me."
"That was pretty strong. What did
she say the second time?"
"She said she liked me pretty well,
but she couldn't think of marrying me,
for she might see some one she liked
better."
"Humph! And tbe third time?"
"Tbe third time she asked me if I
wanted to tease the life out of her."
"Ha, ha, ha! And the fourth timer 1
"Ob, the fourth time she said if I in
sisted upon it she supposed she would
have to say yes."

The English face, tbe Jewish face,

Officers of tbe army on duty in the
war department - wear uniforms the
same as If they were on duty at mili
tary poets. The practice has resulted
In making nearly every room occupied
by officers a dressing room, wbere
wardrobes are kept. Most officers dis
like very much to appear on tbe street
In uniform; it makes them too con
spicuous. Uniforms for use in the de
partment are kept In a wardrobe, and
the officers put them on when they
arrive In the morning, take them off
and don civilian dress to go to lunch
eon, and upon their return In the
afternoon and departure for home
later go through the same process.
They don't like if but it Is an order.
For- people doing business at the de
partment it is much better, for a
stranger knows whether he is talking
with an officer or a clerk, and if fa
miliar with the emblems can tell the
rank of the officer.— Washington Post

FRIDAY AUGUST 28, 1903
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.
\ The Amador Ledger was the only
objector at the time in the whole coun
ty, but during all this time it did not
once charge that the law was uncon
stitutional.
The above appears in an article
published in our cotemporaries
under the signature of W. L. .Rose,
justice of Sutter Creek. It relates
of course to the bill providing a sal
ary for township officers. It seems
that the mantle of defender of the
no-appeal, stop-where-you-are policy
has fallen upon the officials inter
ested. The same statement has
been published, before, that the ob
jections on constitutional grounds
to the salary bill were an after
thought as far as the Ledger is con
cerned;' that no such, objections
were raised at the time the bill was
pending before the legislature. We
have not troubled ourself to correct
these statements heretofore, inas
much as it makes not the slightest
difference to the merits of the case
whether the alleged conflict with the
constitution was raised before or
after the bill was passed by the law
makers. Silence seems to embolden
these advocates in their policy of
falsehood. Mr. Rose and others
who have been writing on this sub
ject ought at least to look up what
the Ledger has said on this question
while the bill was before the legis
lature, before venturing to make
haphazard assertions. The Ledger
of Feb. 27, 1902, in an editorial dis
cussing the subject at some length,
contains the following:
In the event of this salary bill be
coming law, the question is being asked
when will it become operative. The
act itself says it shall go into effect im
mediately; that statement, however,
does not override constitutional pro
visions. No doubt the bill has been
engineered with the view of helping
present officials. The plain language
of the constitution sets up a barrier to
its application to present incumbents.
Section 9 of Article XXI reads:
The compensation of any county,
city, town, or municipal officer, shall
not be increased after his election, or
during his term of office.
In the face of this, it is mere quib
bling to raise the question of whether
or not the proposed law would be an in
crease of compensation. Increased pay
was the very object of the measure.
They are not paid enough under the
existing law; the proposed law is to
remedy this condition
The constitution says this cannot be
done as far as those now in office are
concerned.
PROPOSED INCREASE OF ASSESS
MENT.
County Clerk C. h. Culbert has
received a notice from the state
board of equalization citing Amador
county to appear before a meeting
of that board to be held in Sacra
mento on Saturday, September 5, to
show cause why the assessment roll
of this county should not be raised.
With the assessment roll as return
ed by the county assessor showing
an increased valuation over last year
of nearly $300,000, this proposed ad
ditional increase is somewhat in the
nature of a surprise party. We do
not know on what grounds the as
sessment roll was raised this year.
It cannot be seriously questioned
that property values throughout
Amador county have suffered a seri
ous decline during the past year.
Around Jackson the decline is fully
one-third. In Sutter Creek the de
preciation is probably still more
noticeable. It is useless to discuss
the causes of this decline. Labor
agitation is one of the prime factors,
but not the only factor. In face of
reduced income, it is hard to be
handicapped with extra assessment.
The proposition to add to the injus
tice by a horizontal increase from
the state board, should be resisted
to the utmost. The fact is Amador
county, under present conditions, is
in a position to ask for a reduction
instead of submitting to a raise.
There will be no regular meeting of
the board of supervisors before the
date set for the hearing on the pro
posed increase. Some official action
should be taken however, to present
the situation fairly before the state
board, so as to prevent the carry
ing out of this plan to oppress the
property interests of the county. A
special meeting should be called if
necessary to take action on this
matter. Citizens may go down in a
private capacity, in opposition, but
this is hardly sufficient. Some par
ties clothed with authority to speak
in behalf of the governing body of
the county should be present to ex
plain the facts as they exist, and to
demand a reduction instead of an in
crease. It is patent to every think
ing person that the exigencies of
the government, both state and
local, are such as to demand more
money for their maintenance every
year. To offset this tendency, and
to avoid the alternative of increas
ing the tax rate, the policy is adopt
ed of tryiDg to swell the assessment
roll. To the taxpayer, however,
the practical result is precisely : the
same. "Whether the assessment roll
shall be higher," with the tax rate
the same, or whether the tax rate
shall be the same as last year, with
the assessed value inflated is a mat
ter of little moment. He is called
upon to pay more in either event.
It is simply the difference between
tweedledee and tweedledum. When
the assessment value has already
been swelled to the limit, it is cer
tainly in order to raise a vigorous
protest against a second boost dur
ing the same year.* j
The editorial supervision of our
cotemporaries on the justice's salary
case has assumed a new phase. It
is now relegated to the department
of correspondence, with W. L. Rose,
the local justice of Sutter Creek,
footing the same with his own sig
nature. We are gratified to be'able
to report this progress toward
straightforward journalism. The
justice is seemingly very much in
favor of enforcing the law. The ad
vocates of no appeal have finally
veered round to the same view as
the Ledger on this proposition. The
district attorney and the county
clerk are no doubt just as anxious
to have the law respected and en
forced as is W. L. Rose. The only
difference appears to be that the
county officers want to- find out
exactly what the law is before going
ahead, while our respected township
officer wants them to pay up first,
and find out where they are at after
ward. The gulf between these two
propositions is simply the difference
between the right and wrong way of
doing a thing. It is uphill work to
convince an intelligent public that
it is contrary to law to test the con
stitutionality of a law before the su
preme court Furthermore, it is an
equally arduous task to show that a
law, the constitutionality of which
is in process of being tested, should
be enforced while the appeal is pend
ing. The very object of the appeal
is to discover whether the law is a
vital one or merely a dead letter.
The Ledger cheerfully concedes that
the justices and constables are en
titled to pay under the salary bill if
that law receives the seal of ap
proval from the supreme court. We
would then be found just as earnest
ly contending for their side of the
question, as we now are in urging a
definite settlement of the matter by
the higher court. - If the law passes
the final roll call well and good, the
property holders may still regard it
as an unwise law, but they will at
once say that the township officers
are then entitled to all benefits pi-o
vided thereunder. At the same time,
the necessity of an amendment to
the constitution to prevent a re
currence of such snags in the future
will be made plain.
The outlook for the coming State
Fair is that there will be a larger
number of exhibits that will be of
interest to the general public,
whether dwellers in the city or coun
try, than has been the case for a
number of years past, and that both
old and young will find plenty to
amuse as well as instruct them at
the Pavilion, as well as the fine ex
hibit of livestock at the track.

The last legislature passed a law
providing a minor convicted of crime
might, in the discretion of the judge,
be placed in the care of a probation
officer, instead of being sent either
to state prison or a reform school.
This was a humanitarian move to
avoid the contaminating influences
of a penal institution. In a num
ber of cases it has proven beneficial,
judging from the brief experience
since the law has been in operation.
A lad named Oscar Cuvreau of Ala
meda proved an exception. He was
convicted of theft, and given in
charge of a probation officer. He
failed to report to his guardian, as
the law required, and morever was
detected in petty stealing. The
court was compelled to send him to
the lone reform school until he
reaches his majority.

THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FBIDAY, AUGUST 28, 1903.
SLICKENS AGAIN.
The Stockton Chamber of Com
merce at a meeting held this week,
referred the matter of the pollution
of the Mokelumne river by slickeus
from the copper mines to the state
fish and game commissioners, with
a request that they take action
thereoD. It is useless to deny that
the silt from quartz and copper
mines is injurious to fish. The deni
zens of the water cannot live in
streams which receive mill tailings
in quantity. Below the Gwin mine,
from whence hundreds of tons of
tailings are discharged daily, fishing
in the Mokelumne river is not good
like it'used to be when, the mining
industry was at a standstill along
the borders of that stream. It is
useless to deny the fact that gold or
copper mining along the banks of a
river is incompatible with fish cul
ture. This is well recognized in all
districts where mining is conducted
on a large-scale, whether quartz or
placer. The Stockton Chamber of
Oommerce don't wish to injure the
mining industry; at the same time
it don't want the fish carryiug
capacity of the Mokelumne river to
be interfered with. Tt suggests that
restraining dams can be constructed
at small expense so as to keep the
injurious matter from the river. It
is easy to make such a statement; it
is quite another thing to prove it.
The truth is. any attempt to enforce
a demand to impound quartz tailings
would impart a death-blow to the
quartz mining interests of the
mother lode. The extra cost thereby
entailed upon the mine owners would
be absolutely prohibitory. To take
care of hundreds of tous of tailings
mixed with more than double its
weight in water, daily, is a task by
no means easy. Indeed, . there is
not a mine in this county, nor in the
neighboring county of Calaveras,
that could hope to continue in busi
ness under such an additional ex
pense. The mining industry has all
the burden it can bear at present,
without the addition of this "last
straw" of impounding slickens.
DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
Judge Church, of the superior
court of Fresno county, has just ren
dered a decision which bears directly
on the justice's salary case now pend
ing in Amador county. The Fresno
court holds that the amendments of
1901 to the county government act
regulating the compensation of town
ship officers in that county are in vio
lation of the constitutional require
ment that laws be uniform in their
operation. The legislature in 1901
passed for Fresno county a similar
bill to that which the last legislature
passed for Amador county in regard
to compensation of township officers.
By this bill the townships of that
county were classified according to
population for the purpose of fixing
the compensation of township of
ficers. It provided that in town
ships having a population of 6000 or
over a justice of the peace might re
ceive as fees in criminal cases not to
exceed $140 per month, while in
townships having less than 6000 in
habitants the fees of the justice were
limited to $90 per month. It does
not appear that the law-makers at
tempted to make this bill applicable
to incumbents in office at the time
of its passage, so that it was not
open to the constitutional objection
raised in the Amador case that it
increased the compensation of of
ficials after their election and dur
ing their term of office. It was op
posed, however, on the ground that
it was special legislation, and also
that it was not uniform in its opera
tion. On this point the court says:
Our supreme court has repeatedly
held that the meaning of this constitu
tional requirement that a general law
shall be uniform in its operation is to
forbid the legislature from granting to
any citizen or class of citizens, rights,
privileges or immunities, which upon
the same terms shall not equally be
long to all. By the express terms of
the provision of tho act under review
the legislature in effect says to one jus
tice of the peace in this county: "For
the trial of 40 criminal actions in one
month you shall receive $120, while it
trrants to another justice of the county
for the trial of the same number of
cases the right to receive only $90."
It is difficult to conceive a more flagrant
violation of the rule of uniformity.
This Fresno opinion seems to be
squarely in conflict with the opinion
of Judge Rust in this county. If the
question were carried no further
than the trial court, we should have
one rule of interpretation prevail
ing in Amador, and an exactly con
tradictory interpretation prevailing
in Fresno. That is the sort of
anomaly our local justices are con
tending for. County officials, how
ever, do not propose to sanction
such a policy of "confusion worse
confounded." They recognize thkt
the supreme court is the proper tsi
bunal for the final settlement of sujh
conflicting opiu ions; and propose to
go there, notwithstanding the wig
gling and wailing that has been and
is still being done to slay the march
of the case to that desirable goal.

Being one of the many campers at
Wentworth's Springs or Hulfish, I
take pleasure in dotting down the many
happenings and send to your paper for
publication, which might prove inter
esting to some of the Ledger readers. ■
Last Wednesday we were treated . to
a shower of rain which lasted for sev
eral hours.
, Henry Etzel, John Nichols, and
Ernest Stepenson of Elk Grove, were
visitors at tiie springs to-day.
Numerous names of people from Sac
ramento, Newcastle, Auburn, George
town, Cool and Placerville. will also be
found on the register here.
Two popular young men of Auburn,
namely Messrs. Louio Threlkel and
Bert Darington, started one morning
of last week, at a,bout six o'clock, for
Loon lake.' Their intentions were to
return the following morning, but. day
dawned and the hours passed slowly by
until it was quite late in the afternoon
and nothing heard or seen of the
young men as yet. Then a party of
men. each armed with a shotgun, rifle,'
etc., started out on the search; the
supposition being that they woreeither
tackled by a bear or drowned in the
lake. After several hours' suarch.thiA
were found mounting Tell 's . Peak ,' "a
distance of six miles from the springs.
They had tired of fishing, and taking
their guns wandered on through the
woods, disregarding the passing of
time. The mountains echoed with the
firing of guns The incident caused a
great deal of excitement in camp. They
were welcomed to camp by all the
ladies here. : ; •

Sadden Death.
. Ad Italian named Battista Cassassa
died suddenly at the residence of John
Fregulia on Friday night, August 21.
He arrived from Blue Lakes the same
day. He had been working for the
Standard Electric Company at that
point for about a month. He was not
of a stroDg constitution, and found that
he was not suited to the work in that
high altitude, his lungs being weak.
From the lake he walked to Kirk
wood's, and at this point he secured a
ride to JacksoD, arriving here Friday!
He askoJ permission of Fregulia to
stay there that night, which re
quest was granted. During the even
ing be appeared on Main street, to se
cure some medicine, and it was remark
ed by those who saw him how ill he
looked. During the night he was
seized with a fit of coughing, and
choked to death. The funeral took
place Saturday. Deceased had been
around Jackson for a number of years,
although it is not known that he has
any relatives in this section. Ho was
about 35 years of age.

We have received a circular pub
lished by the state' board of health
calling for a war of extermination
against rats, because these rodents,
it is claimed, are instrumental above
all other animal pests in spreading
the germs for contagious disease.
We have been under the impression
that householders have always been
disposed to destroy rats whenever
opportunity offered, without any
incentive thereto from the board' of
health or any other source. We do
not believe that the war will be made
any more effective by this proclama
tion from the health authorities.

A. Just Recognition-
George Wriggle6wortb, one of the
engineers of the Keystone mine, who
was crowded out of his long and faith
ful service for that company because of
his refusal to join the union of the
Western Federationilast week, has se-
cured employment as engineer at the
Bunker Hill mine, only a short distance
from the scene of his Iformer employ
ment. Wrigglesworth ia the veteran
engineer of Amador county. For over
thirty years he has been continuously
in harness at the Keystone, and his
career in this responsible position was
unmarked by : an, accident. Such a
record is somothing to be proud of.
He knew his engine like a book. Every
foot of the cable indicated to his trained
mind the whereabout of the skip io
the shaft. .He was ever alert and
watchful, and the underground toilers
knew that with Wrigglesworth at the
lever they were as safe as human skill
and forethought could insure them.
Before he went to the Keystone, Wrig
glesworth was engineer at the Amador
Consolidated in Sutter Creek in 1871,
at tho time of the great strike, and his
course in standing firmly by his trust at
that time was in keeping with his con
duct ever since. It was not to be sup
posed that one so thoroughly versed in
his calling would be idle for any length
of time. Men of his stump are not to
be secured every day. We understand
that all the hands, five or six in num
ber, who left the Keystone last week,
have found employment at other mines
in the county.
Special Meeting.
A special session of the board of
supervisors has been called to meet in
Jackson next Monday for the purpose
of taking some action to offset the pro
posed increase of the assessed valuation
of property in Amador county by the
state board of equalization. The super
visors are all dead set against the con
templated raise, as being entirely un
warranted under existing conditions.
Representatives will be ! authorized to
appear before the state board at the
hearing on the sth of September, and
show that property is assessed at a
higher valuation in this county than at
any previous year. We understand
that the principal reason why the as
sessment roll was boosted up nearly
$300,000 by the, county assessor, was
because of 4he determination of the
state equalizers to secure a material
uplifting of valuations. Assessor Mar
chant was aware that unless some
showing was made, the state board
would step in and perform the boosting
act. A ten per cent jump would
amount to considerably more than the
increase made by the county assessor,
and the local officer was led to enhanced
valuation in a great measure to ward
off this greater raise that loomed up
before the county. It is probable that
Assessor J, Marchant and County Clerk
C. L. Culbert, who are both thoroughly
acquainted with property values and
the condition of the county at present,
will attend the ' hearing of Amador
county before the state equalizers.
Coal vs. Wood.
The county buildings are laying in
their supply of fuel for the winter. At
the county hospital superintendent
Barrett is putting in practice a scheme
to economize on the fuel bills heretofore
contracted by that institution. He ex
perimented with Jackson valley coal
last winter and was convinced that by
burning coal be could effect a material
saving to the county. He is now get
ting in 40 tons of this coal. About half
the usual quantity of wood will be taken
as a precautionary measure. He be
lieves that a ton of coal will do the
same service as a cord of wood. As
the Jackson valley fuel is delivered at
the hospital at $4 per ton, while oak
wood costs $6 per cord, it means a sav
ing of one-third in the cost of fuel.
Should this trial prove satisfactory,
coal will be substituted exclusively in
place of wood hereafter.
Teachers' Examination.
_ The board of education of Amador
county met last Saturday to prepare
questions to be submitted to the ap
plicants for teachers' certificates at the
annual examination, which commenced
on Monday last. Only five applicants
one male and four females — presented
themselves fpr the ordeal. This, we
believe, is the smallest number of ap^
plicants for the period of one year that
has ever been known since the organi
zation of the present system . The ex
amination will be concluded to-day, and
the result announced in our next issue.
The Afflicted.
Superintendent J. F. Parks of the
Kennedy mine, was confined to his bed

THE AMADOB LEDGER; JACKSOK, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, AUGUST 28, 1903.
Dwelling Burned.
A mysterious fire occurred on the
grounds of the Oneida mine on Friday
night, August 21, by which the dwell
ing house occupied by H. H. Hurlbert,
the bead machinist of the company,
was totally destroyed, with nearly all
its contents. The fire was discovered
about midnight, and it started from
the outside, but how it originated no
one knows. Two persons were asleep
on the premises, Mr. Hurlbert and his
son, who is also employed about the
works. Mrs. Hurlbert has been away
from home on a summer -vacation for
several weeks, and no fire had been
lighted on the premises for some time,
as the inmates were boarding outside.
Mr. Hurlbert was awakened by the
barking of a small dog that was ' kept
about the place. The antics of the
faithful canine were so unusual that he
was convinced something was amiss,
and the glare of flames showed that
there was no time for delay. He arose
hastily, and awoke his son. They were
only just in time to make their escape,
grabbicg an armful of clothing as they
did so. All the furniture was destroy
ed with the building, except a sewing
machine and one or two other articles.
The little dog that was instrumental in
giving the alarm perished in the flames.
He saved others, but himself he could
not save. The house stood alone, and
while ' the intense heat of the large
frame building threatened _to spread
the fire to the nearest dwelling, the
prompt assistance managed to avert
this danger: *
The dwelling . was owned by the
Oneida company, Mr.- Hurlbert being
a renter. It was insured for about half
its value. The loss Including furniture
Is estimated at over $1000.
The affair is shrowded in mystery,
and has given birth to a good deal of
talk. The hour, and indeed all the
circumstances surrounding the case are
such as to awaken suspicion. No doubt
the authorities will make a thorough
investigation.
Suit for Bight of Way.
A.~ Piccardo and P. 'Podesta have
commenced suit in the superior court
against Fayette Mace to determine
their title to a right of way over the
lands of defendant in section 17 town
ship 7 range 13. The plaintiffs state
that they have been using the roadway
in question for many years in conduct
ing their business of hauling logs . and
mining supplies from the mountains.
Defendant now sets up a claim to the
exclusive use of the road, and on the
19th of August notified the plaintiffs in
writing forbidding them to use the
road, and threatening to build a log
fence across it in case they persisted in
the further use thereof." _ Plaintiffs
claim damages to the amount of $3000
on account of this interference, and
ask the court to enjoin the: defendant
from placing any obstructions in the
way. R. C. Bole and A: Carainetti are
attorneys for plaintiffs.
With the Doctors.
John M. Tmberti, a young Italian
living near the brewery, was operated
upon last Saturday by Drs. Phillips
and Goodman fpr tubercular disease of
the ankle. Small tumors or swellings
appeared in the parts affected, finally
breaking and forming suppurating
sores, at length resulting in disease of
the bone. The patient has been suffer?
ing from the complaint for sorao t)me,
and went to the city two months ago
intending to be operated upon. He re
turned however, without submitting to
the surgeon's knife. Saturday the
diseased part was exposed, and two
pieces of bone removed. This was nec
essary to save the leg. He will prob
ably be somewhat crippled, owing to
a still foot, as the result of the disease
and the operation fpr its cure.
John Bevilaqua was kicked in the
chin by a fractious horse at Scottsville
last Friday, receiving a painful wound.
He is being attended to by Dr. Phillips.
A Bemarkable Summer.
.The coolness of the summer so far is
a matter of general comment. While
the unusually genial weather has been
satisfactory from the standpoint of
personal convenience, it has not been
without its drawbacks. The fruit men
are complaining that the fruit is not
maturing, especially grapes. Some
seasonable hot days are essential to the
timely ripening of the fruit. Grapes
are a couple of weeks backward this
year. In the mountains the stockmen
are complaining at the shortness of the
season and the scarcity of feed. Some
stockmen are driving their cattle out
already. The ranges are becoming
over-stocked, and in addition this year
the spring rains were rather scanty,
which has told adversely to the inter
ests of the cattlemen.
Business Changes.
Adam Huberty, who has been run
ning the Oneida boarding house for the
past two years, has sold out his interest
therein to D. Bonamici of the Garabaldi
saloon, The change took effect last
Tuesday morning. The new proprietor
will still conduct his business in Jack
son as heretofore, his wife taking
charge of the boarding house at the
mine.
G. Giannini last Saturday sold his
one-third interest in the bakery near
the maccaroni factory to J. Camerlo,
who took possession Monday. • Mr.
Camerlo is from Sutter Creek, where
he has been employed in the mines.
The bakery firm will hereafter be con
ducted under the name of A. Dalporta
& Co., the firm consisting of A- Dal*
porta, A. Battista, and J. Camerlo.
Insolvent.
E. Andersen, late proprietor of the
Globe hotel, Jackson, has presented
his petition in insolvency before the
United States court in San Francisco.
His liabilities are given as $5728, and
assets $3029. The matter will probably
be heard before Ira H. Heed, referee in
insolvency in San Andreas, there being
no referee In Amador county. The
hotel property has been tied up since
Andersen left a month ago, pending
the straightening out of the financial
tangk in which his affairs are Involved.
MINING ALONG THE
MOTHER LODE
Closing Down of the Famous TJtica
Mine at Angels —Bonding Claims
Around Jackson.
Bctte Basin.— After working a few
days on the Butte basin gravel claim,
operations were suspended on account
of the flow of water being too strong to
control with the crude machinery at
hand.'
Argonaut. — Large quantities of
supplies are being received at this mine.
It is the intention to put the property
in shape to start up, so that if the out
look justifies the mine will be prepared
to resume operations in a short time.
It will take mouth=. li j.vever, to get it
in shape. Whether it will commence
operations wben it gets in condition to
do so will depend entirely upon the
labor outlook at that time.
Bonding Mining Claims.— G. N.
Wright of New York, has been around
Jackson for several days, for the pur
pose of bonding mining claims along
the main belt, with the view of inter
esting New" York capitalists therein.
He says that there are millions of dol
lars in the east seeking investment. It
is useleps to go there with a small
proposition, such as a single mining
claim. They would not entertain it
for a moment.' But by combining many
claims under bond at the disposal of
one man or company, they are more
likely to take hold. He is trying to se
cure bonds on mining land, whether
under agricultural or mineral title,
from Jackson toward the river. A
number of owners have displayed a
willingness to enter into an agreement.
His proposition is to secure contracts,
making a j first payment due in six
months, and the balance in monthly
instalments. With these secured, he
proposes to lay the matter before New
York men, and form a syndicate to
work the same.
Utica Closed.— The Utica mine at
Angels Camp is a thing of the past. As
a gold producer its history has been
closed. It was the first mine of Angels,
and made the town famous.. For many
years it held tho pride of place as the
greatest producer in Calaveras county;
its total out-put a of gold runs up into
many millions, j For a time its monthly
yield was in the neighborhood of $100,
000, making it at that time the richest
gold producer in the state. The ore
body became poorer in gold bearing
qualities with increasing depth,; while
the cost of operating became greater,
until the point was reached when profit
disappeared. It is one of the very few
instances in the state of a mine, being
abandoned because of the diminution
of the gold in the rock after a long
dividend-paying career. By its sus
pension 200 miners have been thrown

TO THE PUBLIC.
Sutter Creek, August 27, 1903.
The International Union of Steam
Engineers No. 223 believing that the
time has come when it should clearl;
define its position &übmit3 to the public
the following facts: •
In April of this year the Jackson
Union No. 115, Western Federation of
Miners, declared a strike against a
number of mining" companies in this
district.
. This union demanded of the mining
companies —
Ist. Eight hours labor per day un
derground instead of ten.
2nd. Nondiscrlmination.
No demand whatever was made in
behalf of the engineers or the surface
employees either for shorter hours,
more wages, or for any other benefit,
yet certain members of the W. F. M.,
by threats and intimidation, prevented
many engineers and surface employees,
not members of the W. F. M. at all, to
quit work and thus aid the Jackson
Union in winning its strike. The min
ing companies conceded 9 hours labor
underground instead of ten. It was
agreed all around there should be no
discrimination, and work was resumed ;
the engineers and surface men getting
no benefit whatever, but many of us
losing two or three weeks' work.
At this time many members of the
W. F. M. openly stated that they did
not want anyone but miners to belong
to their union. Later the unions post
ed notices that all who did not join
would be treated and published as
scabs. Thereupon the engineers and
mechanics organized themselves into a
union of the International Steam ' En
gineers, affiliated with the American
Federation of La"bor. We had granted
to us a regular charter from the su
preme council, and a duly appointed
organizer came here from San Fran
cisco and properly installed our union.
The charge that we are or ever have
been opposed to the W. F. M., or wish
in any way to antagonize it, or organ
ized at the request of the mining com
panies is absolutely I and unqualifiedly
false. We organized for self protection;
we did not wish to be driven from out
work for the sole benefit of others; we
belonged to a separate craft from the
miners and want to fight our own bat
tles and attend to our business without
outside interference. We are Ameri
can citizens, and only ask our Ameri
can rights to be permitted to work,
support our families, and educate our
children. We have no grievance
against our employers, and are satisfied
with our hours, wages, and conditions.
We have now been organized over three
months, hold regular meetings in Sut
ter Creek,' and have a grpwlUff mem
bership of over 100.
Several weeks ago a committee from
the Amador Uuion, W. F. M., No. 135,
demanded that our members working
in that district join the W. F. M. or
quit their work.. The demand was re
fused. Thereupon a diligent effort was
made by this union to procure the dis
charge of these men,.
The Fremont, Bunker Hill and Key
stone companies, all assured our mem
bers that they could join or not join
any union, lodge or party they desired;
that pursuant to the strike settlement
there was to be no discrimination. The
Fremont aqd Bunker Hill companies
kept their promise, but Mr. Jasper M.
McDonald, Mills Building, and a Park
Commissioner of San Francisco, on last
Thursday discharged his three en
gineers at the Keystone, Messrs. Gray,
Wrigglesworth, Tretbeway and Botto,
members of our union, for the sole
reason that they would not join the W.
F. M. The work of these engineers
was satisfactory, and they were old,
faithful employees of the company, one
of them having served the Keystone
Company 33 years, yet Mr. McDonald
forced these men put of their work.
They have lived in Amador for years,
are respected members of that com
munity, have families and own their
homes in that town. Mr. McDonald
assured and promised them directly
and indirectly, orally and ;in writing",
that he would not discharge them for
refusing to join the W. F. M. This
same man, Jasper M. McDonald, runs
a company store at Amador and.forces
all his employees at the Keystone mine
to trade there, and has done so for
years. It is the only company store in
this whole mining district. We sub
mit to the public that Mr. McDonald is
not a man of his word, he is unfair, un
ust, un-American.
The Anthracite: Coal Commission
made this finding r i
"It is adjudged End awarded that no
>erson shall be refused employment or
in any way discriminated against on
account of membership or non-member
ship in any labor organization, and that
there shall be no discrimination or in
terference with any employee who is
not a member of any labor organization
by members of such organization. "
This finding has been approved by
the press and the people of the whole
country, yet it remained for Mr. Jasper
M. McDonald, Park Commissioner of
San Francisco, to discharge three faith
ful employees because of a demand from
a labor organization of which he was
afraid.

Hail Time Changed.
The time of the arrival and departure
of mail between Jackson and Plymouth,
and all intermediate points, has been
changed by order of the post office de
partment. The change went into effect
yesterday morning. Mail by Steiner's
stage now leaves Jackson at half -past
7 in the morning, instead of half-past 2
in the afternoon, and arrives in Jack
son at 6 p. m. dally, except Sunday, in
stead of half-past 10 in the morning.
Owing. to this change it will be im
possible for the Ledger to reaob its
readers in the northern part of the
county until Saturday morning. Under
the revised schedule one stage line be
tween Plymouth and Jackson will be
dispensed with, and Jackson will be
come the headquarters of the line in
stead of Plymouth as heretofore.
Fish for Lake Tabeatt.
A meeting of the looal organization
for the protection of. game was held at
Spagnoli'B drug store Wednesday even
ing to discuss the proposition of en
deavoring to stock Tabeau reservoir
with fish. A committee of three was
appointed, namely, F. A. Voorheis,
Dr. C. A. Herrick and A. Caminettl, to
interview the Standard Electric Com
pany with the view of securing the
company '8 permission to stock the lake.
All the spawn required will be gladly
furnished by the state fish commission
ers. Black bass is the species of fish it
is intended to make the trial with, and
those versed in the matter say there is
no doubt the fish would thrive there.

A.* 0. V. W.-Haisei Rates
Local members of the Ancient Order
of United Workmen have just received
the official statement of ,the : new - plan
of assessments, and complaints are to
be heard on all sides because of the in
crease "in rates. By theT- new scale,
which goes into effect October ' Ist,
there will be a general advance, especi
ally on those of advanced years. The
new rate for all over 50 years is $8.40
per month on $2000, while the present
rate is only $3.84.
COMPARISON OF RATES.
Under the pld system the assessments
for this month are as follows: Ages 18
to 24, $1.30 on $2000; 25 to 29, $1.44; 30
to 34, $1.62; 35 to 39, $1.88; 40 to 44,
$2.26; 45 to 49, $2.88; ,50 and over,
$3 .84. Under the new system the rate
for $2000 is increased each year, start
ing at $2.48 on $2000 at 18 years and in
creasing to $8.40 on a like amount at 55
and over.
Those over 54 years will be given the
chance to pay one-half their assess
ments and the interest at 4 per cent per
annum on the unpaid portions and have
the amount remaining unpaid deducted
from the amount of the certificate at
death. Those over 54 may also do any
of the following things: Receive a paid
up certificate for the amount of the de
ficiency according to age; take a lower
rate than $8.40, and continue payment
throughout life by* 1 having the differ
ence in value charged to the certificate
and deducted at death, j-
While there are many who are com
plaining because of the large increase
in the rates, there are also those who
argue in favor of the new system. §

THE LARGER FOOT.
See if This Shoe Salesman's Theory
Fits Yonr Case.
"The question of which foot to fit
first is an important one to us," said the
shoe salesman. "It may seem strange t<j
you, but it is rarely that we do not ex
perience some trouble in fitting one
foot while the other is easily covered.
A popular belielJjDbtalus that the left
foot of every person Is the hardest to
fit, ..nd consequently many shoe clerks
always try a shoe on that foot first It
Is not true, however, according to my
observation, that there Is any inflexible
rule as to which foot to try first. It is
true, nevertheless, that in a majority
of cases If you succeed in fitting the left
foot you will have no trouble with the
right. My practice is to try both feet
before I pronounce a pair of shoes a
perfect fit. Then lam sure of avoiding
any mistake growing out of peculiar
ities of . foot formation. . No two per
sons have feet formed exactly alike,
and the shoe salesman who thinks so
and is governed accordingly will meet
with many complaints.
"For some time I pondered over the
problem of fitting shoes to feet, and es
pecially as to why the left foot should
be considered ttje ' standard by which
to be governed. The only rational the
ory I have ever been able to evolve is
a very simple one when you come to
consider It. Nine out of ten persons
you meet are right handed, as we say.
About one person In ten, or perhaps the
per cent Is even less than that, uses his
left hand. If you will observe persons
who use the right hand when they are
standing and talking 'they invariably
rest their weight on the left foot. And,
vice versa, a left handed person will
rest his or her weight on the right foot
The result Is that with right handed
persons the left foot is probably a frac
tion larger than the right foot, and the
shoe clerk must Inevitably find this to
be a fact sooner or later." — New Or
leans Times-Democrat ■ .
ROMANCE IN VARIED GUISE.
Definition of the Word Is Bnsceptlble
of Wide Diversification.
What is romance? ~ Even the collo
quial use of the term is varied. . When
we say "you are romancing'? or call
anything romantic as distinguished
from what is real or what is true we
mean one thing, but quite another
when we apply the term romantic to
natural scenery. And in this applica
tion we must distinguish between the
effect upon us of that which we call
romantic because of human associa
tions with certain sights or sounds and
that wildncss of nature which we call
romantic because of its absolute dis
sociation from anything human.
Keeping out of mind the use of the
word in artistic and literary criticism,
let us try to find what element of
reconcilement there is in the diversities
of colloquial usage. ■ • . ■
In all that is generally called ro
mantic in . the cases above mentioned
there Is the common element of
strangeness. We easily revert to what
must have been the original sense of
the word in its connection with those
mediaeval modifications of the Latin
tongue known as the romance lan
guages. The Saxon or Celt would
have found his native tongue sufficient
for all ordinary needs, but If he
caught the Roman air in any way, by
travel or refinement of taste and habit,
he would, to meet the newly developed
need, borrow the graces of the Roman
speech — that is, he would romance. —

Rockefeller and the Bung*.
In former years John D. Rockefel
ler's supervision of Standard Oil com
pany affairs took in even the smallest
detail. On one occasion, according to
Ida M. Tarbell in McOlure's, com
menting on a monthly statement, he
called a refiner's attention to a dis
crepancy in regard to bungs, articles
worth about as much In a refinery as
pins are in a household. "Last month,"
he said to the subordinate official con
cerned, "you reported on hand 1,119
bungs. Ten thousand were sent you
at the beginning of this month. You
have used 9,527 this month. You re
port 1,012 on hand. What has become
of the other 580?" Apparently Mr.
Rockefeller's idea was: Take care of
the bungs and the barrels will take
care of themselves.
The BUatress' Character.
The London Globe prints a "char
acter" which au English servant leav
ing kindly gave her mistress: "In an
ser to your letter, it's not a bad place;
the Mrs. understands her dutye, and is
sivel and obliging, but troubles about
getting up early in the mornings. There
Is plenty, and if you don't mind a place
where only one other young lady Is
kept besides yourself, you might give
them a month's trial. I like more so
ciety, which is why I am leaving."
His Nnrron Loslc.
"If I had my way," said the man of
high principles, "there would be no
money in pdlUlcs."
"But" said Senator Sorghum, "if you
didn't put any money In politics it
Isn't likely you conld have your way."

EMERSON'S PROSETSTYLE.
Held to Be Locking In the Quality
of Writer* Called Masters.
What shall be said of Emerson's
prose? Was Matthew Arnold right
when, as an experienced critic calmly
judging the favorite author of his
youth, he denied that the "Essays,"
the lectures and "English Traits" form
ed a body of prose of sufficient merit
to entitle Emerson to be ranked as a
great man of letters? It seems as if
the time had come for Emerson's coun
trymen frankly to accept this verdict
Because of deficiencies, both of style
and of romance, Emerson does not
belong to the small class of the great
masters of prose. His style, despite
the fact that "Nature" and many of
the essays contain pages of eloquent
prose almost equal in power and beau
ty to noble poetry, was nearly alwayr
that of the lecturer or preacher rather
than that of the writer. He too fre
quently lost the note of distinction and
was content if he satisfied his far from
exigent audiences. In diction, to be
sure, he was a conscious and consum
mate master, and It need scarcely be
said that few writers have surpassed
him in the ability to compose a preg
nant sentence. But as is generally ad
mitted and as is shown by his prac
tice of piecing his notes together, he
was rarely able to evolve a paragraph,
much more a whole essay, in a mas
terly or even In a workmanlike fashion.
It may be granted that critics have
overemphasized his lack of coherence,
that there is more logical unity In his
essays than appears on first reading,
that "English Traits" and the later
volumes are far \ from being mere
strings .of "orphic sayings," but the
fact seems to remain that the prose
style of Emerson from first to last
lacks the firmness, the compass, the
precision, the flexibility, the Individ
uality we demand of the prose writers
whom we denominate masters. — Pro
fessor Trent In Bookman.
MIGHTY TREES OF SIERRA.
Greatest In Sise of All Creations of
the Living; World.
During all the ages nature has fa
vored the growth of forests on the Pa
cific mountains, providing the peculiar
conditions which make them far differ
ent from, greater In size, more luxuri
ant, than any other in the world. Of
all the creations of the living world
none is so great in size, so majestic in
presence, as the mighty trees of the
Sierra and the Cascades. For here the
air is always fertile with moisture,
clouds blown in from the Pacific ocean
rest among the mountain summits, even
crowning the tops of the trees them
selves, and here discharge their rain. 1
The soil is deep and spongy with cen
turies of decomposing vegetable matter,
furnishing an' unequaled nurturing
place for vegetation, and there are no
extremes of heat in summer or depths
of cold In winter, says the Century
Magazine.
Every condition has been favorable
to unexampled exuberance of growth
not only of the largest trees, but of all
manner of undergrowth, vine, shrub
and brake. A huge tree falls, decays
and is yellowed with thick moss. Im
mediately scores of young firs and ce
dars spring up along the top of it— the
first chance of a bare spot In the wood.
Old burned stumps, gathering soil In
their hollow Interiors, aw nurseries for
colonies of young trees, some strong
Individual finally shouldering out the
others, growing larger, and, as the
mother stump drops away, sending Its
roots downward into the earth through
the disintegrating textures until it in
time becomes a great tree. ■
Women* Strength i n Tears.
The weakest woman in all the world
Is armed with one weapon against
which man's pride and strength are
powerless. Her tears will win when
everything else has failed. A woman's
tears move her own tender sex' as well
as the sterner masculine brutes. Old
and young yield to their potential
spell, and when the woman happens to
be pretty there is no telling what will
follow when her bright eyes grow
misty with these messengers from a
wounded heart. It Is folly to attempt
to Ptniul out nßalust a woman's tears.
They have caused revolutions. They
have made and unmade many a great
cause. They can be met In only one
n-ay — unconditional surrender.—Ex
change. '
Placing: Him Right.
As a northern express drew up at a
station in the early morning for a few
minutes' wait, a pleasant looking gen
tleman stepped out on the platform,
and, inhaling the fresh air, enthusias
tically observed to the guard:
"Isn't this invigorating?"
"No, sir; it is Normanton," said the
conscientious employee.
The pleasant looking gentleman re
tired.—London Telegraph.
Absence.
"We are here today," said the solemn
looking man with a thin neck and a col
lar three sizes too large for him, "and
gone tomorrow."
"That's right," agreed the dyspeptic
looking man with the Ivory black ci
gar, "and when we get back six months
later some of our best friends want to
know where we've been for the last
two weeks."— Puck.
A Stamp Wasted.
Pettishly she stamped her foot They
were standing on the corner. He had
offended her in some way. Again she
•tamped her foot
"Well," he said slowly, "here is a let
ter box, but yon must know you can't
drop your foot in It You are simply
wasting postage."— Judge
Revenge is a kind of wild justice
which the" more man's nature runs to
the more ought law to weed it out.—

GUARDIAN CRANES.
They Take the Place of Shepherd
Dog« In Venesnela.
The natives of Venezuela and ad-
Joining countries on the north side of
the river Amazon often avail them
selves of the services of a native crane
to care for their poultry and also, in
the place of collies or shepherd dogs, to
guard and herd their domestic animals.
This remarkable bird, which the In
dians call yakamik, and the ornitholo
gists Psophia crepltans, is found in a
wild state in the great forests which
lie between the northern coasts of
South America and the Amazon river,
particularly in Venezuela and British
Guiana. The birds never leave the for
ests unless shot or captured. They may
be trusted with the care of a flock of
sheep or' domestic fowls and every
morning 'will drive the ducks and poul
try to their feeding places and, care
fully collecting any stragglers, bring
them safely home at night A yakamik
soon learns to know and obey the voice
of Its master, follows him, when per
mitted, wherever he goes and appears
delighted at receiving his caresses.
It pines at his absence and welcomes
his return and is extremely jealous of
any rival. Should any dog or cat ap
proach it flies at it with the utmost
fury and, attacking It with wing and
beak, drives it away. It presents itself
regularly during meals, from which it
chases all domestic animals and even
the negroes who wait on the table if It
Is not well acquainted with them, and
only asks for a share of the eatables
after it has driven away all who might
aspire to a favorable notice from the
family.— Brooklyn Eagle. ■ . - na
A Long Dance.
William Kemp, an English comic ac
tor who flourished during the last years
of Queen Elizabeth and who belonged
to the same company as Shakespeare
and "created" Dogberry, danced from
London to Norwich,- a distance of 114
miles. He was accompanied by a serv
ant, an umpire and a man with a tabor
and pipe. Crowds hindered his. start
on Feb. 11, 1600, and many met him at
every place. Several tried to dance
with him, but none could rival his pace.
The most successful were women. v - Al
though delayed by a snowstorm, he did
it In nine days, -and on the way accept
ed a challenge or two, each time com
ing off best,' except when a Chelmsford
maiden of fourteen danced till he was
■ready to lie down." On his return he
wrote -an account of.it, which 1 ends
with a warning to those with whom he
had made wagers that If they, did not
pay up he would publish their names.
The "Nine Dales' Wonder,", as the title
runs, Is a merry, readable pamphlet.

No Langaiitre of Their Own.
Among the peoples of the world the
Swiss are alone In having no language
they can call their own. According to
a recent visitor to the little country,
about ■ three-fourths of the people of
Switzerland speak German, while the
remainder divide four other languages
among them, mainly French and Ital
ian, the .languages varying as a rule
according to the proximity of the peo
ple to each country whose tongue they
speak. Public documents and notices
are printed In both French and Ger
man.
In the Swiss congress, or national
parliament, the members make their
speeches either in French or German,
for nearly all the members understand
both languages. The orders of the pres
ident are translated by an official in
terpreter and furnished to the newspa
pers in both languages.
Cariosities of Color.
After any severe shock you will be
very likely to find that you have be
come, temporarily color blind.
Your perception of green light has
probably gone, at least partially. White
objects will then appear to you of a
reddish purple and green objects to be
very much duller In hue than ordi
narily. .
Any one can make himself or herself
temporarily color blind by j wearing a
pair of ruby red glasses. The prolonged
action of red light on the eyes ends by
tiring out the nerves which receive red
light. Consequently when the glasses
are at last removed a rainbow appears
to have only two colors— yellow and
blue.
Self Convicted.
"Say, pa," queried small Bobby,
"what is gossiping, anyway?"
"Gossiping, my son," replied the old
man, "if we get right down to the
plain, unvarnished facts, is lying.' But
why did you ask?"
"Because," answered the young in
vestigator, "ma says you do a lot of
gossiping every time your business
keeps you late at the office." — Ex

A Famous New .York Bank.
Early last century a charter waj
granted a company to set up a chemical
works In New York, and in considera
tion of the boon these works would tw
a clause was added granting banking
privileges. The astute men at the head
of the concern saw possibilities of de
velopment on banking lines not ap
parent in the manufacture of chemicals
and decided to make the business a
banking one. To retain the privilege,
however, it was necessary to manufac
ture chemicals, and so then, as today,
an admirable pretense was made of do-
Ing this. In the fine establishment of
the great Chemical National bank on
Broadway a little shop Is apportioned
to a manufacturing chemist, who pot
ters about mixing Ingredients. He is
not much troubled with business, but
now and again a New York citizen will
startle a visitor by taking him into this
fine bank and asking for a dime's
worth of castor oil— which is supplied.
This was the only bank which did not
suspend specie payments during the
civil war.
Military Geese.
Even the geese In Germany marcb
with military precision, which may be
the reason why the famous drill style
of the German infantry is called the
"goose step." A writer in Travel thus
describes the great goose armies which
are so interesting to the health seekers
at Bad-Nauheim:,;i iT-W. W. « - ••;.•
"Itis worth while to go to Ober-
Moerlen at 6 o'clock in the afternoon to
see these 'geese returning home from
the fields. The village is white with
them; hundreds and • thousands, regi
ments and brigades of geese, marching
along with military precision. 1 As they
near home they separate of their own
accord; sfxteen to the right, twelve to
the left, a detachment up a lane, and so
on — all quacking loudly, but bearing
themselves with that keen sense of or
der and discipline which distinguishes
the vaterland." ! -•/-.- -\
Why Corn Fops.
Finally a scientific sharp comes to
our rescue and in science explains the
phenomenon of the popping of pop
corn in an extremely lucid and interest
ing manner. The learned gentleman
says:'
"The starch polygons are of such na
ture and construction as to facilitate
expansion and render It explosive . in
character. There ■Is a fracture ' of a
particle' along Its two radii; the endo
sperm swelling very considerably, the
peripheral portions cohering with the
hull, . but the fractured quarters turn
ing back to meet below the embryo."
And there you are. Deliciously sim
ple, Isn't It?— Cleveland Plain Dealer.
■Where the Ladies Propose.
Between the mountains of India and
Persia Is a powerful tribe, among
whom an extraordinary custom-pre
vails. Woman's rights have apparent
ly received full recognition, for the la
dles of the tribe can choose their own
husbands. AH a single woman has to
do when she wishes to change her state
is to send a servant to pin a handker
chief to the hat of the man on whom
her fancy lights, and he is obliged to
marry her, unless he can show that be
is too poor to purchase her at the price
