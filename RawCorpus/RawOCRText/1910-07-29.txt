Concert Saturday
4 t
The Jackson Military band gave an
open air concert last Saturday evening
on the porch of Love's hall, which
was greatly enjoyed. Prof. A. S.
Moore, the new bandmaster, who came
here from Berkeley, was head musician
and brought ; out' a fine program in a
very satisfactory manner. Moore
seems to be in ' earnest as far as his
band work goes and it remains with
the individual players if a first class
organization is to be counted on.
Jackson needs a good band, and there
is positively enough demand for it to
put it on a good financial basis, under
proper management. The open air
concerts will continue regularly in the
future.
Saturday evening next the city will
be treated to a concert of an ex
ceptional character. The new band
leader is deterrrined that everything
in his power will be done to make the
band a creditable organization, and
one that Jackson will have a right to
feel proud of. The following program
has been arranged and will be ren
dered at the concert :

Dance A Success
Jackson's Booster's dancing club
held a grand ball in Loves' hall last
Saturday evening that far excelled
anything thus far carried out by this
energetic society. The crowd was
large and the dancing hugely enjoyed.
Patton and Springer's orchestra from
Lodi was engaged and furnished some
of the latest dance selections, together
with other popular dance music. J. A.
Piccardo acted as floor director, and
his popularity adds to the club as a
good drawing card, the members of the
boosters' club acted as floor managers.
Dave Brisco, Frank Garbarini and J.
L. Fontenrose, were on the committee
of arrangements, and had everything
in such shape that the occassion was
bound to be a grand success.
Many carriages came in town bring
ing in dancers from all over the
county. The local liveries had a good
supply of teams ordered out of town
for the occasion. The proceeds of the
dance amounting to over 840. were
donated to Jackson grammar school.
Barn Destroyed
Nick Bacich, a farmer residing
about two and a half miles out of
Jackson, had the bad luck to loose his
season's crop of hay about 50 tons,
which was destroyed by tire last week.
Bacich's ranch is located just above
the Zeila mining property, and tho
blaze could be seen by many Jackson
residents. The barn and several farm
ing implements were totally destroyed.
Base Ball Game
Greatly Enjoyed
A large crowd packed Zeila park
Sunday afternoon to witness the
hardest contested game played on the
home grounds this season.
. Angels Camp ball team arrived in
Jackson Saturday night and were the
guests of the local team at the
Booster's dancing club ball, held in
Love's hall Saturday evening.
The game was exciting throughout
and the score a tie, 8 to Bat the close
of the 9th inning, in the 10th and
final inning Angels Camp made four
more runs, while Jackson got three
strike outs, leaving the final score 12
to 8 In favor of Angels Camp.
L. Raggio, pitcher for the visiting
team, proved a regular puzzler, and
strung the scalp of many of Jackson's
best batters on his belt. Beyer,
catcher for the Calaveras team,
seemed to be quite a favorite with his
home team, and the work of his team
desevea special mention. In the 10th
inning with three men on bases and a
tied score, the mask handlers made a 3
base hit bringing home 3 runs, and
then on a one base hit by R. Kaggio,
he scored his own run.
. While Jackson was defeated, still it
can be truthfully said she has far the
best ball team and played the best
game of ball.
 Skelly walked under a pretty fly that
was far over the foul line, and held it
for an out, made several good hits and
played a grand game throughout.
Gromer plays all over the diamond,
always watching the ball. He is the
best first ! - baseman that has . eyer
played ' on the park this season,
barring no team, and is a most
valuable help to Jackson. Fortner
scored two runs and did very good
work behind the bat. Steele, the new
left fielder, had two runs placed to his
credit, and Mason 1 run. Mason hit
a pretty fly right into right field that
.was fumbled, letting him make 3 bags
on' it, there were no coaches on the
third bag, end the second baseman of
the visiting team in a wild throw
to the catcher, : who missed the ball,
caused many to cry "home". Mason
started home, .but was put out between
bases.  . . ■ i
In the 9th inning in a run home to
home plate, Schwartz collided with
several players, was knocked out for a
few minutes. He resumed the play
however, and finished the game. Dor
roh of the Angels team, complained of
a broken finger after the game. He
was struck by the ball on the fingers
end while in the' act of catching it,
and the finger was badly injured.

installed their newly elected officers
last Saturday evening. July 23. Mrs
J. J. Wright, D. D. G. P., of Jack
eon, was the installing officer and she
was assisted by Mrs Annie D. Hurst
and Miss Aileen Fleming. A program
of exceptional interest was rendered
several interesting speeches were de
livered, and the evening's proceedings
concluded by a sumptuous luncheon.
Doctor Fights Fire
On Trip to Patient
Shortly after 11 o'clock Saturday
morning, a fire was discovered at the
residence of Nicholas Glavonich on
north Main street, in what is known
as Newmansville. The property is
owned by W. D. Dufreno and is fully
covered by insurance. Dr. Gall was
driving out Main street as the tennant
rushed into the street crying 'fire, fire'.
He immediately tied up his team, and
with the assistance of E. Dufrene,
who resides close by, the fire hose was
connected at the plug just opposite the
burning building, and in less than
two minutes a good stream of water
was pouring over the burning shingles,
and the fire quickly put out, before
much damage could be done. Had the
same fire started Thursday when the
water was shut off, the property would
have positively become a total loss.
Giovannoni's delivery wagon was on
its way to the store when the fire ' bell
rang, and he turned his team and
hooked the hose cart to the rear of the
wagon, and after learning the location
of the fire, galloped his horses to the
scene of excitement. The blaze was
extinguished however, just as the hose
cart arrived.
The building was crowded with in
quisitive men, women and children
after the blaze was put out, when sud
denly the ceiling which was weighted
down with water, fell in, scratching
and frightening the crowd who fought
their way through front and rear doors
into the yard. No loss was suffered to
furniture, and the loss to the property
is not great.
Eloped and Wed

to.them. , " .., * ' •■ ■
Goes for Treatment
Wm. Tarn left last Saturday morning
for San Francisco, where he was ad
mitted to the German hospital to

MINE NEWS
ALONG LODE
Interesting Accounts of
Mines Located In
Amador Co.
Climax
Dr. Aitken, who has control of thl3
property, situated a mile or so south
of Pine Grove, has interested a
number of Eastern capitalists in the
mine, and expects to secure its de
velopment on an extensive scale. The
doctor has spent years on this mine,
and has great faith in its future. He
realizes that the only way to test its
value is to sink to a considerable
depth, and demonstrate by actual
mining whether or not the gold-bearing
veins of this belt reach far down into
the earth. As far as developed the
mine shows a strong ore body, several
hundred feet in length, and carrying
pay values. He proposes to get a com
pany to sink the shaft to a depth of
1000 feet. The indications point to a
well-defined fissured vein, with gouge
and smooth walls. The gold-bearing
character of the quartz is abundantly
Sroven by the work that has been done
ere in the past. The one point that
remains to be decided is whether the
gold bearing ore continues to such a
depth as -will command the attention
of capitalists who operate on a large
scale. There are a series of mines
along this east belt, which would no
doubt be stimulated into activity by
the opening of the" Climax at depth.
Dr. Aitken went to San Francisco
Sunday on business connected with
this mine. He hopes to organize a
company prepared to spend $100,000 in
equipment and developing the mine to
a depth of 1000 feet.
Dane-Mitchell '
We understand this mine near Pine
Grove has come to a temporary stand
still. Considerable money has been
expended on the surface, but no effort
has been made to explore the property
at greater depth. Two hundred feet is
the extent to which the mine has been
prospected. It is a mere scratching
of the surface, and leaves the problem
of a good paying mine still undeter
mined. The superintendent left for
the city early this week and hopes to
induce those behind this mining ven
ture to furnish capital to sink several
hundred feet deeper. ,
Central Eureka
A strike of rich ore was encountered
in this mine early this week. A small
seams of bonanza rock was discovered
in the 1200 foot level. How extensive
it is cannot be told, but it may lead to
important developments. The stock
has materially stiffened in price. It
was quoted at 65c before the strike;
now it cannot be had for less than $1.
Rebekah Installation

installing officer,
Miner Becomes Insane
A young miner named H. W. Trego
ning, who has been boarding at the
Globe hotel for the past several
months, became violently insane last
evening, and it required the united
strength of several men to subdue the
frantic man, and prevent him from in
juring those seated in the hotel lobby.
Wm. Green, one of the proprietors of
the hotel said he noticed that Tregon
ing was acting exceptionally queer all
day yesterday, and was on the verge
of a break down, but dreaded to report
the matter to the authoriteis, because
of the gentlemanly way in which the
young miner conducted himself. He
said the young fellow ate a hearty
supper, after which he returned to the
lobby and seated himself in a chair,
and began to talk aloud to himself, of
murders and blood and all sorts of
vicioust crimes. Green notified deputy
sheriff Connors of his conduct, and
Connors approached the demented man
and seating himself besides the miner,
asked him if he was feeling ill. This
angered the man, who began threaten
ing Connors. After satisfying himself
that the victim was unsafe to be at
large, the sheriff was notified and the
naniac was bound after a hard struggle
and taken to the county jail.
Tregoning has two brotnersr reisding
in this state, and an uncle in Grasa
Valley, who it is reported to be welt
fixed financially. All will be notified
of the man's condition, and it is ex
pected something will be done in hia
behalf to prevent him from being
sent to Stockton insane asylum.

BOOST, DON'T KNOCK
The spirit of boosting is infinitely to be preferred to that
of knocking in any community, and all under circumstances.
In order to boost it is not necessary to resort to falsehood or
even exaggeration. ■ It is nothing more than the disposkiou
to picture the favorable side . of' things. And certainly in a
county like Amador, where so much can be said in its favor
there is no excuse for painting a gloomy picture. The truly
perfect.- land has never yet beeu discovered, but Amador
comes as near to the ideal as any spot on earth. Therecau
be no question that the couut'y has been retarded by the per
sistent "knocking" that has been, and still is being indulged
in. Petty jealousies crops up in every town. It is a trait in
human nature that is not commendable, but nevertheless it
cannot be overcome. The less fortunate are disposed to envy
those who have forged ahead in their respective departments
of human activity. This spirit, however, ought to be con
trolled by the more powerful incentive, of self-interest. In all
progressive communities, when enterprises big with promise
of benefit to the many are projected, the hammers of the
knockers are discreetly kept in the background for the time
being at least. If a stranger comes in our midst with the
intention of looking into the merits of some mine, with the
view of inducing capitalists to invest, therein, should the
property in his judgment as an expert warrant such a course,
let us encourage such investments by all legitimate argu
ments. It makes no difference whether the mine to be ex
ploited is along the mother lode, or miles to the east or west
of it. In no case does the case warrant knocking. We are
as proud as the next one of our mother lode mines in what
they have surrendered in the past, and the. promise of con
tinued liberal output for the future. But we do not believe
that the mother lode embodies all the auriferous pay ore
shoots in Amador county. We see no reason why nature
should have exhausted her stores'of gold in one fissured vein.
Placer gold has been liberally scattered over the whole ter
ritory of Amador couuty, with possibly the eastern section
commencing several miles above Volcano. Acceptiug the
theory that the quartz veins are the parents of placer gold, it
should follow that rich deposits of gold in quartz are hid
away in the earth to the east of what we call the main miner
al belt. Exploration has not disproved this idea, because the
gold bearing quartz ledges to the eact have not been tested in
depth. Extend the glad hand to the prospector, no matter
what section he elects to make the field of his mining opera
tions.
THE GOVERNORSHIP NOMINATION.
As the primary eloction draws nigh, it becomes inceasing
ly evident that the contest for the republican nomination
lies between Curry and Johnson. All the hopes of the sup
porters of the latter — the Lincoln-Roosevelt league or insnr
gent wing candidate — center in a division of the regular re
publican forces between the other four candidates. In a clear
cut issue between the regulars and insurgents the latter
would be overwhelmingly defeated. The refusal of Johnson
to commit himself squarely, in the event of his own defeat at
the polls, to the support of the nominee, has opened the eyes
of many to the hollow character of the Johnson movement.
Democrats are hoping that Johnson may win the nomina
tion. Some of them have gone so far as to register as rebub
licans for the purpose of helping him out at the primaries.
And they boast of their conduct in this regard, and tile beue
ficiare-to-be is so tickled over the situation that he has this
democratic endorsement scattered iv circular form all over
the state as proof that he is fhe right sort of man to head
the republican ticket. Altogether it looks like a mutual
benefit scheme between the Johnsouites and democrats. To
us it scViiis like fatal inconsistency for Johnson to appeal for
a party uomi nation and at the same, time refuse to pledge his
earnest support to the rival candidate who may chance to
outrun him for the nomination. And the reason he gives
for this queer stand is that the republican committee that de
mands this pledge of party loyalty is not truly republican.
Iv other words. Johnsou lms to read the state central cou>
mittee out of the party in order to bolster up his ovu free
lance claims. The Ledger has no objectiou to any of the
other candidates, but '.believing that Curry is the strongest
of the bunch of regulars, we think it is policy in this crisis
to concentrate upon liiin to avoid the calamity of a no-party
man being the republican standard-bearer this fall.

The magnetic detector of Rossi sig
nals the arrival of Hertzian waves by
changing the twisting oscillation of a
fine iron wire stretched in a magnetic
field. Two bar magnets are in line
parallel to the wire, with' like poles
pointing in opposite directions. The
wire carries a small mirror at its
center, and is surrounded by a wire
coil traversed by an alternating cur
rent having a frequency equal to that
of the torsional oscillation of the
stretched wire around its axis. The
mirror oscillates with tho wire.
Placed in circuit with the antenna, the
degree of oscillation of the stretched
wire 13 diminished whenever ',it is
traversed, by the high frequency cur
rents produced in the antenna by the
arrival of Hertzian waves, and the
signals so received can be recorded
photographically by a ray of light
from the mirror. This receiver, unlike
others, can be made, to respond only to
special wave 3 .' It can be adjusted for
various . frequencies, and is affected
only by trains of waves of a very
small range of frequency.
"Light without heat" was found
twenty years ago in in a large j Cuban
firefly; In the ." Photinus Pyralis, " a
smaller firefly common in Washington,
Drs. H. E. Ives and W. VV. Cobblentz
have now made a more complete in
vestigation, and have found ., the lumi
nous efficiency to be 96.5 per cent, as
compared with 0.4 per cent for the
carbon glow lamp, 1.3 for the tungs
tenlamp and less than 4 per cent for
the mercury arc, the most efficient
artificial illuminant The firefly light,
being green, is not adapated to human
use. It is possible that white light
may be built up by combining the
emissions of several substances like
the firefly material, and then the
efficiency might reach 45 per cent.
Ruebel bronze, a new German alloy
of magnesium, zinc,' copper and alumi

metal of a Zeppelin airship, the weight
would be lessened nearly 4 tons.
The military wireless telegraph of
Major Beddington, of the British
army, is very portable, and can be put
into operation on the field within 15
minutes. In a lake test near Keswick
messages were sent and recevied over
a distance of 16}^ miles-, although a
hill 1800 feet high was interposed be
tween the stations, the probable
effective range being estimated • not
less than 40 miles. An ordinary two
horse-power motor-cycle engine is
used to drive a dynamo to produce the
electric discharges, and the impulses
are sent through 100 yards of double
copper wires suspended between two
24-foot poles. A copper wire gauge
mat on the ground gives earth connec
tion. The apparatus is realily carried
on horseback, the mat — weighing 200
pounds— being the heaviest load, while
the motor and dynamo weigh only 170
pound:-!, and tho poles are attached to
a pack-saddle in 6-foot sections.
The stone-preserving compound of
R. M. CafTall is a mixture of paraffin

paraffin prevents organic growth.
This is the material with which was
checked the decay of the pink granite
Egyptian obelisk that was set up in
New York in 1881. On its new site
the obelisk began to weather rapidly
and in 1885, when the protective coat
ing was applied, 780 pounds of loose
chips were removed. The heating of
the surface necessary in applying the
mixture — the melting point of which
is 410 deg. F.— did not have the in
jurious effect feared. Tne heat caused
the substance to be absorbed to the
depth of half an inch, and 67% pounds
were applied to tho 200 sqaure yards
of shatf and plinth. In the 25 years
sines then, 1 tho "stone has shown no

A curious kind of automatic fire
curtain was described at the late
Duesseldo'rf Mining Congress as - a
French engineer's device for stopping
the spread of mine explosions. Planks
thickly covered with powdered schist
are placed in the upper part of tho
gallery, and when an explosion occurs
the displaced dust forms a neutral
zone that checKs the firedamp mid
protects tho part of the mine beyond.
Buckets of water so arranged on the
planks as to be easily upset are found
to have a similar effect.
A metal for tho hearings of ma
chinery— cheaper than tho usual ones
containing copper— has been sought by
W. Guertler in a soft matrix of lead
imbedding iron or its alloys as harden
ing material. As lend and iron do not
mix In a molten state an intimate
mixture of the powdered rru lala was
prepared either by precipitation dilute
lead solution with iron powder or by
grinding iron powder nnd "lead-tree"
crystals together, «nd the mixture was
heated to 250 deg. or 300 deg. C. and
stamped in molds. Various iron alloys
may be used instead of pure iron.
The products compare favorably in
mechanical qualities with the more ex
pensive bearing metals of copper in
lead or tin, and can bo readily pro
duced. The stamped metals are re
gardod ns true alloys, obtained with
out fusion. Similar product» were ob
tained by Friedrich by kneading, with
one or more of the constituents in a
pisty condition, and these also are
pronounced genuine alloys.
Banana maal is among the food sup
plies that is rapidly extending in use.
It is made by drying and grinding the

nearly S3 per csnt of starch and only 3
or 4 psr cent of sugars. A special

Newly Weds
Are Shipwrecked
San Jose, July 23.— Following is a
whirl wind courtship and romantic
marriage to Miss Cynthia Love, 20
years old and one of the prettiest
young women of this district, Albert
Brown, with his weeping bride of a
month on his arm, was taken to the
city prison last night by deputy sheriff
HoWard Buffiington of Santa Clara
couny and chief of police Noble of
Palo Alto charged with wife-desertion
or bigamy.
The young bride, Mrs Bown No. 2,
re+'used to believe in the guilt of her
husband until he confessed to chief of
police Noble, when she sadly left the
police station with a promise that the
circumstances which prompted the
criminal action of her husband would
be fully explained to her in the morn
ing.
Brown was married to Miss Love
about one month ago at the First
Baptist church in this place, the Rev.
John M. Dean officiating. The mar
riage followed a short and strenuous
courtship and the couple took up their
abode at the Gait house. The charge
against Brown is that he was married
a number of years ago, and has a
wife and two children living at Hoi
lister. He is said to have deserted
his family two years ago.
Chief of police Noble has been trac
ing Brown ever since he deserted his
wife and children. At the time of the
desertion he sold all of the household
furniture and left the woman desti
tute. The second child was born just
one week after Brown's disappear
ance. He came to San Jose some
months ago and obtained employment
in a local concern, taking quarters at
the Love residence on West James
street.
When first confronted by the officers
he pleaded that they should not tell
his young bride. Miss Love says that
even yet she cannot believe that her
husband is guilty of any wrong and is
confident that extenuating circum
stances will furnish a reason for his
criminal action. Brown is 32 years
old and has been honorably discharged
from the army. Mrs Brown, No. 1,
will prosecute and is expected here
this afternoon.

Farther Particulars of the Late
Fatal Accident.
July 28. — Leland Fardner was allowed
to see his grandma - and ; her children
for the first time today, and they were
trying to find out from him how the
accident happened in which Mrs Gard
ner was killed on the 12th instant. He
said when they left Amador, which is
about three-quarters of a mile from
where Mrs Gardner was found lying in
the roadway, the horse got to acting
inervoußly.^As: soon .as they got . on
level ground his mother got out and
fixed - a piece of the harness that was
hanging down on the horse's hind legs.
After that the horse went along all
right, until they started over the top
of the hill, and then the horse started
to run and kick. His mother cried out,
." Whoa, Addie; whoa. Addie"— they
tailed the horse 'Addie.' Then his
mother told him to jump out, which he
did, and struck on his head. His mother
stayed in the buggy, but the little fel
low was dazed, and did not know what
happened. The road is all cut up with
big ditches— water breaks we call them
'-and close to the top of the hill at the
first water break the boy's hat was
found, and at the next one, about 100
yards down the hill, a sack of oatmeal
was found, and at the next and lower
one :Mrs Gardner was found lying in
the road. About 50 feet below her the
boy's tracks were first seen in the
road when he started to walk down to
Miss Miller's place.
The little boy is still at Miss Miller's
house, and thinks his mama is over
home about half a mile from our house.
He asked the nurse today if his mother
could sit up yet, as he has been out of
bed only two days, and thinks his ma
ma ought to get well as soon as he did
and go to the mountains with him and
his papa. Mrs Allen, the nurse, is go
ing away to.day, and we will have to
be careful and not let the little fellow
krid\rwhere his mama, is until he gets
entirely well. • " '• '.

Near-by Counties
The trustees of the lone Union High
school have elected W. |t Turner of
Esparto, Yolo county, principal for the
coming year. Mr Turner is a man of
wide experience in this field, and the
trustees feel that with him at the
head of the institution they will have
a very proserous school year. — Echo.
Justice C. P. Walter was called to
Burson Thursday by the death of
Lambert Littleneld, an old resident of
that section. Though Mr Littleneld
had been sick for over a year and
under the care of a physician mo3t of
that time, his death occurred during
the absence of Dr. March, his phy
sician, in another part oori r the state.
It was desired to inter the body in
Amador county and for that purpose a
death certificate was necassary. To
straighten out the tangle, Judge
Walter went down and held an in
quest for the purpose of enabling him
to give the legal certificate.—Pros
pezt.
A letter received by Mrs Fred Yager
tho early part of the weA, conveyed
the news that her father, Thomas
Reid, had died in a hospital in New
York City, July 10th. Death was due
to an accident. He had been enjoying
himself in the park, and in returning
to his sister's home, where he resided,
was knocked down and run over by a
cab. The result was a fractured hip
and shoulder, with internal injuries,
that caused hi 3 death in a few hours.
Mr Reid was 76 years old. He was a
resident of lone for many years, and
was known to almost everbody. He
was a hard working man and rather
peculiar in many ways. Ho was fond
of telling his experiences while a
policeman ih New York, where, as a
matter of fact, he had one of the
best billets in the city. His two
daughters are married to well-known
lone men, one is the wife of Jud. C.
Jones, now of Fallon, Nev., and the
other the wife of Fred Yager of lone.
The widow, Mrs Ried, is making her
hams with her daughter in Fallen.—

Where Credit is Due.
_ People of Jucknon who suffer with
sick kidneys and bad backs want a
kidney remedy that can be depended
upon. The best is Doan's Kidney
Pilla, a medicine for the kidneys only,
mmle from pure roots and herbs, ans
the only one that is backed by cured
in Jackson. Heres' Jacskon testi
mony :
Mrs J. Bastian. 60 Pitt street,
Jackson, Cal.. says: "In my opinion,
there is no other kidney remedy equal
to Dorms' Kidney Pillls. Their value
for relieving pain in the back and
other symptoms of kidney trouble was
thoroughly proven in my case about
three years ago and at that time I
publicly recommended them. Since
then, another member of my family
has taken Doan' Kidney Pills, pro
cured from the City Pharmacy and has
received relief from kidney complaint.
My advice to anyone afflicted with
this trouble is to give Doan's Kidney
Pills « trial."
