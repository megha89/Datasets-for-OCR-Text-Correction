MINERS' STRIKE
Declared On and Off in
One Week.
The Alines again in Ooeration
'lint labor situation in Jackson has
materially improved. On Hnturclay
Hut Jackson Minor's Union, associated
vvllh llm Western Feeletßtiou, de
clared n strike against the Kennedy,
Argonaut and Zeila mines. Typo
written noticos were poßted up in two
or tin ou places about town to that,
effect. Tbo following is a copy of
the notions posted :
To Whom It Mny Concern:
Having refused to j?nint; to thu un
derground men, the. eißht-hout day,
in compliance with the stato law ol!
California, ami having refused to
moot and discuss the dill'oreijcua Im
tween their oinplovees and them
selves: We the members of Jpoksou
Miners Union No. 115 of tbe Weatc.ru
Federation of Minere as a part of said
employee, do hereby call an oillciul
strike, agaiust tho Konuedy Mining
Company, Tbo Zeiln Mining (Join
puny, and tbe Argouaut Mining Com
pany, opernting In Amadoi county"
California, und call upon all men to
(Insist from vvorlt in any capaoity, for
the above companies until such tiiuo
as the eight-hour day is grouted
them.
Ibis strike is called titter repeated
attempts on the part of the mou in
volved to bring about a poacenblo ad
justment nf the dilHoulty between
their employers and themselves; and
tbe refusal of the oompauies to treat
with them in any manner, and de
manding both waya and lunch on the
same time, in contravention of the
law, forces the resorting to drastic
mensuios ou Lhu part of the men in
volved, tor tbe protection of their
rights and tbe enforcement of tbe
law.
liy order Jackson Miners Union
No. 115.
THUS, COKKA,
Aotiug Secretary.
J. F. HUTCH INHON,
Executive board Member W. b\ M.
It is singular that tbe only nnmesj
signed to this document are the two
delegates liom the outsidn, Jos.
IJutchinFon, wbo is a member of tbe
eseoutive of W. .F. M. and Thos.
Corra, wbo is aotiug secretary of. tbo
Jackson Union, siucu B. Dutsoti, tbe
regularly elected senretary resigned
his position last week, on account of
wrangles growing out ot the present
trouble. 'J he notices did not have
an appreciable effect upon the situa
tion. Certainly tbo declaration of a
strike neither enticed those at vvork
to quit, nor deterred others from ko
ing to work wbo were so disposed.
It weakened tbe cause of the strikers
rather than bolped them. Tbe
truth is public opinion is strongly
against tbe men tor quitting work in
tbe way they did. The questions in
dispute are not capable of a settle
ment by strike methods. Neither
concessions by tbe mine owners, nor
Hut giving in At tbe mine workers
will definitely settle tbe issues in
volved. Tbey are matters for tbe
courts to decide, it is meiely a
question of tbo proper interpie
tation of tbe law, and tbe courts are
specially instituted for that purpose.
The Kennedy baa fared better
than other mine hereabouts. Its
works are inclosed by a good fence,
and armed guards are stationed at
diliereut points to prevent trespass
ing. Tbey have their own boarding*
bouse and sleeping rooms sufficient
to accommodate nearly 100 men.
Tuesday tbey bad a force of 40 meu
underground.
Tbe Argonaut force was teduoed
Monday. No one was working un
derground, tbe repair crew having
been Induced by intimidation to
quit. At tbe Zeila tbe same condi
tion prevailed. Nothing doing be
yond keeping out tbe water.
lioth Monday and Tuesday morn
ings a crowd of Austriaus ami
Italians gathered for the purpose of
intercepting tbe few men on their
way to tbe Kennedy. Tbe Konuedy
grade was picketed in this way, also
tbe trail through tbe I'icoardo Hold.
Sheriff Gregory and bis deputy W.
Connors, also ooustable Ijitvoronu,
were also out to see that no violation
of tbe law was made. Jt must be
admitted tbat tbe firm ttaud of tbe
ottlders in this emergenoy bad a
wholesome eifect in deterring tbe
atrlkoiH from attempts at violence.
Wben a mau appeared on his way to
work at tbe mine, tbe strikers would
line up across bis path. Ho was
tberoby ooinpelled to push bis way
through, or stop to be talked to by
tbe strikers. Tbe spokesman for the
latter wus Jos. llutuliinsou. lie whs
tbe talking as well us the walklug
delegate. Not another niuu showed
up among tbe crowd capable of dis
cussing tbe aituutiou in tbe Kuglisb
lauguHge. Tbe only persuasiou re
eoitbd to by tbe mob was calling
"scaub," meaning "scab." Home
pnld no Mttention to this insulting
opltbet; utbers were riled .up and in
one or two iustnnces burled dellanoe,
and dared any one of the mob to're
peat tha Insult to h>s face. In one
instance mi employe of tbe Kennedy
in pushing bis way through a line of
slrlkeis, olbowqd one of them olt tbe
sidewalk into tbo ditch along the
toadway, liutcbluaon called, the
sberilT'a atteutlou to it. "Hnn that,"
bo said, in a tono that implied that
it was time for the orHcial to lake up
tha matter. Iho sberilt replied to
the otfect, that the obstructionist got
just what was coming to him.
The employees say that they aould
not have gotten through the crowd
had it not tn:en for thn presence of
the nlllmiiH. On I'uesdny tbo sberilt' 's
ofllco poßli'.'l up at the corner of
Court and Main streets a typewritten
notice, giving extracts from tbe
penal code, iv regard to ussonibly of
crowds Iv thn streets and highways,
and other provisions lieiiriug upon
this situation. This bad v wholesome
cfFoct. No act of vlolanco lins been
committed and no one bos been
arrested.
Weduoaduy morning thorn vyun no
gathorbig c( stiikres to waylay the
men on their way to work. They bad
evidoutly made up their mind to
quit. The Kennedy .had .80 men,
utidei ground that morning, and. tbe
mill was restarted with 40 stamps
dropping. At tbe Argonaut from 15
to 20 men wont to work iv addition
to the surface men. The mill came
to a standstill tbe end ot last week.
It will take severul days to do , the
neoeseary repair work in tbe shaft
preparatory to taking a full working
force.
IJunug Wednesday the miners
flocked to thn several mines in droves
applying for work. They realized
that tbe strike was a failure, and^by
delay thoir chances of getting em
ployment would be jeopardized.
There was no discrimination as re
gards nationality. Naturally, the
men who had taken an aotivo pait in
inciting the men to go oat wero not
wanted. At tbe meeting of tbe
Miners Union held Wednesday even-
Ing, after a stormy discussion, the
strike was ottioially declared off, by
the vote of the ' very meu wbo bad
precipitated it. It is said tbe walk
ing delegates wore for continuing the
struggle; but tbe better counsel pre
vailed. Or rather, the foar of losing
all opportunity to get back to work
was tbe controlling factor iv ending
tbe trouble.
Yesterday morning tbe Kennedy
bad 180 men underground; tbe Argon
aut had all tbe force they could
utilize at present, until tbe shaft is
put iv shape. The Zeila gathered
iv quite a working force. The
miners have settled down to tbe
conclusion tbat the strike was ill ad
vised and hasty. The Kennedy mill
started up 40 stamps Thursday, tbe
Mil cumplement will be dropping in
n few days. At tbe Zeila tbe mill
will be started fortbwill as every
thing iv tbe shafts aud drifts was put
in first class condition immediately
preoding tbo strike. Tbe Argonaut
will take a week or so to get in
running order again, preliminary to
starting the mill.
The other mines are getting alone
nicely. Tbe South Eureka kept its
20 stamp mill running all tbrougb
tbe crisis, but tbe 12U stamps of tbe
Central Eureka which were running
ou South Eureka ore, had to be
bung up.
The Bunker Hill aud Fremont will
no doubt lußume milling opeiations
in a few days.
Tbe meu who" have mainly con
tributed to break this strike are tbe
few employes of tbe Kennedy, wbo,
in face of insult and threats, con
tinued at tbeir work at tbat mine,
running tbe gauntlet of tbe string ct
pickets night and morning on tbeir
way to and from tbe mine. Several
of them were small in stature, but
tbey were all big in moral courage
aud stamina, and refused to be
intimidated by the taotios of tbe
strikers.* -A .number of times they
passed through the .picket lines with
out thu presence of peace officers.
Conscious that they wero defending
tbeir rights as American citizens
tbey, tow against tbe mob, fought
the strike to an utter collapse.

Golden Rule Order.
!*&!. I*. Smith, prlnoipal .of the
.Berkeley IJusinoss College, was" in
Jackson aud other parts of ■ the
county last week. His particular
business in addition to advaucing
the interosts of the college in every
way possible was to organize lodges
of tbe Golden Rule Order of the
World- an organization to promote
tbe carrying out of tbo golden rule
laid down by tbe man of Nazaretb,
"Do unto others as you would have
others do unto you." It is purely a
moral movement for tho uplifting of
humanity. He spoke to tbe pupils
of the Preston school, and also
several otber points in Amador
county.
Mr Smith informs us tbat be has
organized a club of this order among
the school children of Jackson with
40 charter members. Also a club at
Sutter Creek and Amador City in
connection with tbe schools there.
He intends to go east shortly, in
carrying out tbe principles ot tbe
order there. Tbe motto adopted
by this new organization is, "lie
good, do good, make good." Truly
no better motto for the guidance of
human actions could be devised.

MINING NOTES.
Garibaldi Placer.— The clean-up
of tbe Garibaldi placer claim at
Voclano has progressed to tbe extent
of 000 feet of tbe pay channel, leaving
200 feet more to be cleaned up.
There has been taken out so far fully
tflli.OOO, and tbe other portion is ex
pected to bring up the season's run
to fully 920,000. Jos. Uarbaldi tbe
owner, was in Jackson yesterday, and
displayed some of tbe big nuggets
taken out. .Tbe two biggest chunks
weighed nearly four ounces; the
largest being worth 810 and the
otber B'iO. There is pay gravel
enough to last for years. He will
make a clear profit, after paying all
expenses of getting tbe claim in
running order, of 911,000 for the
season. Hereafter be. intends to
abandon tbe hydraulic process, and
resort to drifting. It is slower work,
but less expensive, and tbe net re
sults will probably be equal to the
bydraulio method-, besides avoiding
tbe many troubles which beset tbat
process.
Bunker Hill- This mine paid its
usual dividend, No. 32, of tbree cents
per share, on tbe 15th instant. Not
withstanding tbe strike, It was deem
ed by the management that there was
no necessity of witbolding tbe divi
dend. It has been deoided to take
advantage of the situations, and do
some necessary work in straightening
out the abaft. A bend was made in
tbe original sinking to facilitate tbe
work. To remove this will oocupy
several weeks, and no otber work oau
be done while this is in progress,
except at points above this where
this repair work han to he done, it
is therefore likely tbat tbe mill will
be idle for a brief period. Tbe com
pany has a' good surplus on hand —
between *(K),000 aud 870. o<)O.

liumi our big clubbing offer with
liulletln In advertising columns.IGNORANCE A MENACE.
The lesson of the present strike of mine employes is the
dauger of employing a preponderance of ignorant workers of
auy one class or nativity. There is no danger iv employ
ment of any number of the intelligent class, for the reason
that a man of intelligence depends upon his own judgment,
and cannot be swayed by the clamor of the multitude. In
almost every issue that arises, the sentiment of those who
think and act for themselves will be divided. They cannot
be led like a flock of sheep by some bell-wether exponent of
the gospel of the workingman. But with ignorance there is
a tendency to accept the say-so of some self-constituted
leader/and follow his directions, without, the mental capacity
to determine, each for himself, the right or wrong of the mat
ter. The labor trouble that has resulted from the interpretation
of the eight-hour law could not have occurred except through
dense ignorance on the part of those who quit the mines
under the impression that their rights under the law were
not respected by the mine-owners. The men the laborers
have most to fear are the professional labor agitators — the
very men who poise as deliverers of the oppressed toilers
from the clutches of their heartless employers. They make
a business of going about seeking whom they may devour,
but their prey is invariably the class whom, by their high
sounding. profession of regard, they seek to redeem from
bondage. They grow fat in this sort of campaign. They
have no material interest in the localities in which they do
their campaigning. The moving spirit is a desire to rake
in the shekels from the hard earnings of the toilers. This
is their main chance. Aud when their mission is played to
a standstill in one place, they move on to another to repeat
the same game upon the gullibles of another community.
SUPPRESSING STRIKE NEWS.
The course of the big dailies of San Francisco in practical
ly ignoring the strike of the miners of Amador county has
been the subject of general comment. These papers have
been apprised of the situation from . start, by regular press
and special telegrams, bat for some* unknown reason they
have failed to publish the facts. The Call, several days
after the trouble began, gave a statement of the dispute over
the eight hour law, and announced that the miners were out
in all the mines of the mother lode in Amador county.
Beynod this the city papers have been silent. They have
pursued a similar course in other cases of labor trouble grow
ing out of the eight hour law in other counties. We are at
a loss to account for this policy of suppressing important
items of news. It is out of joint with the policy pursued
in regard to like information telegraphed from points out
side of California. When the Goklfields strike was ou
columns were devoted day after date to keep the readers
posted. But here in one county — Araador— a strike in
volving a walk-out of over one thousand men, and the
stoppage of mines producing $200,000 per month' is deemed
unworthy of notice. A strike in Paris- has commanded
more attention from San Francisco papers than the shutting
down of a dozen producing mines in this state.
ORGANIZE FOR PROTECTION.
The crisis we have passed through the last two weeks
shows the necessity of an organization* on the part of the
business men and property holders of the town, for self
protection. That a brace of outsiders should invade this
section, and bring about a paralysis of the business interests
by heading a lot of foreigners in a labor strike, without some'
counteracting movement on the part of citizens generally
is amazing. With any sort of a local organization it is
hardly possible the trick could have been turned. Or
ganization does not mean violence against threatened
violence. It simply means to offset the moral force of one
set by the moral weight of another set. Perhaps the policy
of doing this in the midst of a strike which has been un
accompanied by any actual violence, may be a mooted
question. At any rate, the citizens ought to get together in
the near future, and take some steps to guard against a re
petition of the business disturbances we have gone through
of late.

Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises Rn area of
-648 square miles. It lies on tho wes
tern slope of Sierra Nevada uountalns,
andemDraces within ltf errltory nil
tho -diversity of valley loothlll, and
high mountainous lands. :; :,
Climate.— The climate of thp popu
lous portions of tbe county Is as genial
and healthful aa can be found anywhere
In California. As climate Is ono of the
most valuable assets of this favored
state In attracting population, Amador
Btanda second to no connty In this re
gard. It should, and no doubt will In
time, when Its climatic advantages are
more thoroughly understood and ap
proclatod*, become a health resort not
•only for those In loss favored states,
but for tho residents of other parts of
California. The temperature alone the
central portion rarely falls below 30
degrees above zero In winter, and aa
rarely rises to 100 degrees iv the sum
mer. Snow suldotn falls In the settlod
districts, and nover remains on the
ground for more than a few hours. Of
<:oursu, In tho high mountain regions
of eastern Amador tho snowfall ia very
heavy— which la churactf.fUtic of the
entire Siorra Nevada range. Tho sum
mer season is alway "accompanied with
■cool nights; permitting of sound, re
froshiutf slumber. .Fogs are raro, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
infrequent. - !
Gold Mining. — The county, although
rich in other sources or wealth, com
paratively untouched, is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. The
deepest gold mines in America tire lo
cated here. Tho Kennedy mine Is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
3000 feet below the surface, with every
Indication that tbo pay-ore extends to
- a much greater depth. Since the dis
■ covery of gold, the county has contrib
uted fully $100,000000 to the world's
supply of tho precious metal. The
mines are still yielding at the rate of
- about two millloo dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
eight or ten mines operating on what
is called the "mothor lode," stretching
clear across tho county in a north-east
erly direction a distanoo of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate between
• 400 and 500 stamps, and furnish em
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
industry is still in its infancy. The
unexplored territory, even along the
malu gold belt, Is far In excess of tbo
ground that has actually been worked
•or prospected . The county offers to
day one of tho most inviting Holds to
be found anywhere in the world for the
investment of capital in the fascinating
business of gold mining, not alone along
the mother lode, but also in tho almost
untouched mineralized country ot the
■ east belt, some tenor twelve miles from
tho main lode.
Besides gold, we have copper, de
posits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
limestone, • granite,- and soapstone or
talc— all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities.— The agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The vulley lands
will produce anything that can bo
grown In the most favored sections.
In tho foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetable aro raised where Irrigation
is practicable along tho numerous water
courses. Further up in tho mountains,
an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet, tho
soil is admirably adupted for apples
und potatoes. A ready market for
many times the quantity now raised of
these commodities can bo found tin the
various mining towns.
Grapo culture and wlnemaking are
becoming important industries,' both
tho grapes and wino commanding a
hotter price than the product of the
lowland. I
Landis cheap compared with other
California lands. Improved farms may
bo secured for one-fourth the price
V.urront in somo phieos. Unimproved
lands can bo hud from $o to $10 per
acre. It doos not require a fortune to
buy a small ranch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agrioulural pop
ulation. Vust tracts now dovoted to
cattle rao<res might bo mado tho homos
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amudoi' has a population of lesa than
12000. Three fourths of this is concen
trated in a strip of three miles above
and below tho mineral belt.
Jackson, tho county seat, bus about
2500 inhabitants, and lsun incorporated
■city ol tho sixth class. Other towns
are Suttur Crock, Amador City, Dry
towD, I'lymouth, Volcano,- Fiuo Grove
and Olotu. lone City Is the inoiropolls
of tho valley section, a thriving town
of WOO inhabitants.
Tho community la law abiding. Edu

Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition.
TIIK HAWAIIAN DUILDINO, A.-V.-P. EXPOSITION, SEATTLE;
The building erected at tho Ala3ka-Yukoii-Pa?!fic Exposition for tho
exclusive use of the Hawaiian Islands, occupies a prominent position on
the Court of Honor next the central government structure.
Hawaiia has prepared a. more extensive and comprehensive exhibit
Of its marvelous resources than for any other world's fair. It will show
all of its native fruits and vegetables; will offer an aquarium of live fish,
and in various oth,er ways interest the fair visitors. ; Fruits will be
Berved by native girls and native orchestras' and 'singers will be always
on hand. A tank In the center of the structure will show the islands as
they rest in the Pacific Ocean.
Upwards of $100,000 has been expended in assembling Hawaii's
display.-
THE AUDITORIUM AT A.-V.-P. EXPOSITION*, SEATTLE.
Probably the most striking structure on the grounds of the Alaska-
Yukon-Paciflc Exposition is the Auditorium. It is builded of reinforced
concrete, steel and brick and is a part of the rich legacy which is to be
handed down to the State University when the Fair is over.
The Auditorium stands oipon an eminence overlooking the main en
trance to the Exposition Grounds. It is now in use as a lecture room
■by tho University Law School and for all assemblys of students. It has
a seating capacity of close to 3000, which can be greatly increased.
Facts Gleaned in Reading.
There may souao day come a time
in a few billion years— when all the
salt iv tbe world will be in the ocean.
Salt ia ono of the easiest dissolved
minerals iv the earth's crust, and
every tiny stream of water that final
ly makesjta way to tho Eoa carries
with it some minute particlu ot salt,
liver since tho woild began, the
streams uud rivera have bson busily
engaged iv carrying this salt from
tho land to tho sea. And ouce the
salt reaches tbe sea, tliero it slays.
Tho water in tho ocean is constantly
bsiug ovupotutod, and taken out nud
renewed, but the salt reniaiua. Some
one, with not much eke to do, aud a
tnate for statistic, baa llgured out
that jf all tho suit iv tbo ocaaus wore

cover 7,000,000 srjunra 'miles to the
depth of one foot. Somo of tho grout

Verses 1-s.— Are good men liable to
hold wrong opinions.
When good men differ in opiuion
what is the better way in order to
reacb an understanding.
WHEN a professed Christian gets
angry with another Christian, on a
mere matter of opinion, has he not
backsliddeu from tbe Jove of God,
and wbat.spirit does it show. (This
question must be answered in writing
by motnbers ot the club. )
Circumcision no doubt originated
from uuppased purposes of health,
and physical cleanliness, nud after
wards became a national institution
of -the Jews.. State when God first
made circumcision the sign, cr
token, of tho covenant between him
and Abraham and his seed, aud to
whom tbe rite of oiicumcision and
God's convonant extended. (See
Gen. xvii.)
Is circumcision now essential to
salvation.
Is tbe belief of any doctrine es
sential to salvation.
Verses G-ll— Js experience of God

proof of tbe will of God in the
matter which the oxperienoo covers.

time tbat raining had not opened its
coffers to him affluently he quit tbe

town of Fairplay. In 18G3 he married
at Flaoervllle, Mary lirown of
Frankfort, Germany. He ran tbo
hotel at Fairplay and made money
In tbe business. He finally sold his

The Jackson Plymouth Mail lioute
A postal lytufn agent from Him
Franchoo was hero last ' woek, for the
expreeß purpose of looking over tbe
mail rcmlo from Jackson to Plymouth
as now conducted, with a viow of
remedying as fur as poesiblo tbe glar
ing defects of tbe existing system.
It is notorious tbat a letter address
ed to Plymouth and mailed to Jack
son early In the morning does tint
reaoh its destination until late in the
evening, and tiavels 75 miles, where
as Plymouth is only 12 miles by
direct route. Again a letter fiom
Drytowu to Amador City— only four
miles apart travels 75 miles to get
tbere, consuming 12 hours Iv the trip,
when ono hour by direct route would
easily accomplish it. Jackson papers
directed to Plymouth, aud placed iv
tbe post office here Friday do not
reach the northern town until dusk
on Saturday. Tbo absurdities ot tbo
present mail routes in this county
aro self evident. It Is surprising tbat
tbe government has not taken action
long ago to bring about a more equit
able arrangement. Tbe special agent
went over tbe route with John
Kleiner of the Plymouth stage line,
and wo look to see a change for the
better ere long. We would suggest
that the people of the north end of
tbe county get up a petition to con
gressman Englebiigbt, pointing out
tbo shortcomings of tbe existing mall
facilities, and requesting him to take
steps to remedy tbe same. There is
no doubt this course would lead ton
prompt revision of tbe mail contracts.

The Free License Business.

awarded a freo license iv tho same
business for all points iv the county
outside of Jackson. This aoticn
corses on the top of a free licones for
the thtoo months preceding. Now at
10 per week, this free litimiso is
tuutumouut to a gift to. the favotud
individual of 8210. -What will (lie
taxpayers of Amador county thin It
of this act of generosity— or more
properly speaking, favoritism on' the
purt at those intrusted with tbe
management of tho county's
finances. The buideu thus taken
from tho shoulders of the individual,
means tho imposition of tin addition
al corresponding burden upon the
general taxpayets. It must bo ro
menibored that this free licenso was
granted without any formal request
in writing from the party benelltted.
So far aa the record shows, it was
unasked— literally forced upon the
benollciare. There is no plea of in
digence or charity to back it up.

New Ice Plant Started.
J'mv persons are aware of tbe
extent to which John Strohm has
lately enlarged his ice making
plant, aud the big outlay involved
therein. For a couple of months
mou have been working to install
tbe large electric motor and tbe com
pressor for the ice making business.
It is now nearing completion. Ihe
75 horse power dynamo was started
for the lirst time Sunday and worked
nicely. The whole plant bus been
tested, and found to bo all right. It
was expected to get tbe new works
started at ico making to-day, and to
run steadily thereafter. This im
provement has iiivovied an expend!
tare of 810,000. The two plants, the
old one being of only 8 tons capacity,
bavo cobt 818,000, to say nothing of
the beer making plant. Altogether,
Strohm has spoilt $50,000 on the
biewery aud ice plant. The new
plant is equal to 20 tons of ice per
day. 'The consumption of ice in
summer averages about 5 ' tons per
day for tbo general public, and 3
tons per day used in the brewory
business. And to prcduco this
quantity the plant hud to be run to
its utmost capacity nißht and day,
aud still fall short of the demand.
It has cost SIiOOO per year for import
ed ice. This outside expense will bo
entirely obviated now, aud ample
provision left for a big iu<:rcaso iv
the demand.

The Lime Deposits.
A gentiumau named I.'ohh mudo a
trip to this couniy from Stockton thu
liilter i urc ot last ivwik. Ho camo for
tho express purposb of inspecting the
lime deposits iv the viciuity of
Mount Echo. These deposits are
commanding much attention. While
virtually nt a standstill, they will
unquestionably be tho scene ot much
activity in tbo near future. We are
iutormed that the owners of ttie lion
ham quarry, which ia under au
option of sale to the Spreokles com
j>auy owning the sugar refinery at
Salinas iv Monterey county, have
asked for a bid on BUUO tons of lime
stone rock, delivered at lone. This
is the biggest order, or rather pro
posal, that has been received. It de
monstrates that those interested are
keenly alive to tbo possibilities of the
lime resources of this county. Tbo
difficulty is not iv quarrying the
material, or the quantity, but tho
transportation problem iv shipping it
the three miles which iutorvenes be
tween tbe quarry and the railroad do
pot ut lone. The J. aud K. road is
nearer tbe quarry, but there is no
road, aud tbe county to be traversed
ia rough aud billy, presenting morn
serious obstacles to ; transportation
than even tbe three miles to love.
In the event of the Speoltels option
huing permitted to lapse, soino ettort
will doubtless be made to organize v
company to purobaao the quarry, and
construct a tramway to the railroad
so aa to bo üblo to deliver tho
mineral at a price to compete with
other outside points. Iho option
runs until November next. It is not
likoly, however, that it will bn aur
rendered.

CALIFORNIA STATE
UNION HELD SESSION
Tbe California 'Htate Union of tbe
Western Federation of Miners met In
Angels Miners' Union ball during
tbe past week, thla being the first
annual convention. One delegate
from eaoh local union lv the state
was present; alao the president, vice
president, sooretary-treaaurer and six
members of the oxeoutlve board.
it was thought the efforts of the
state union, a&alsted by the western
federation of miners nnd other bodies
of organized labor, tbat the eight
hour mining bill was introduced nt
the lost session of the legislature and
signed by the governor.
One of the questions coming before
this convention was tbe eight bour
hill and juat what it meant. It waa
brought out during tbo discussion
that if the men wero to accept tbe
Interpretation of tbo mine operators,
many of the employees would have to
work eight biul . nne-balf and nine
hours underground, not including
tho timi) tor lunch.
in regard to tbe eight bour law the
following resolution was adopted:
Kesolved: That tbe hours of work
for the men employed in under
ground mines, smelters nnd reduction
works start when tbe whistle blows
or the bell- rings and work eight
hours, excluding intermission of time
for lunch or meals. Time begins
when tbe men start underground uud
coasos when they leavo tboir place ot
work.
Tbe polioy ot the union is tbat in
cases, ot grievances it would bo best
for a committee to meet with tbe
operators and have a talk, so that all
petty troubles would bo settled and
that tbe operators should be willing
lo meet with miuli committee.—

TAFT RESTORING
LAND FOR ENTRY
It may be stated on blgn authority
tbat ttbe president la convinced, as n
lawyer, flint, tbe wholesale wltli
drawHls of land In the tnr west, mnde
by order of president Koosevelt, with
a view to furthering bis conservation
policy, were made without warrant of
law, and consequently tbat the reoent
rcstorationa of parts ot that land to
public entry by secretary Dallinger
has tbo president's approval.
Mr ioft has gone over the legul
phases of tho mutter with great care,
and satisfied himself (lint tbe presi
dent, while clothed with authority
to withdraw public lands from entry,
has not as free a hand lv that matter
as Mr Kousovelt took.
There is also authority for saying
that tbe president believes there has
beeu much exaggeration of ■ the
danger that the water-power trust
possesses such detailed Information
as to the location of water-power
sites, in tbe mountain states us to
enable it to gobblo up tbe sites an
the restored lands bofore the geologi
cal survey can have time to locato
them tor withdrawal, under a future
aot of uongress. . «■ .
Tbo lands In. question nro already
restored to entry, aud some time
must necessarily elapse before tho
geological survey, although its ou
glueers are already iv the field for
tbut purpose, can . made surveys of
tbo water-power sitos and do tho
other things that will be necesasry
before tbe government can interfore
to savo those sites for tbe public use.
The fear, in tbe minds of reclama
tion and geological survey oilloials,
has been thai; tbe water-power trust
does in fact possess just such in
formation 83 tho president is inclined
to hold they do not possess. Whicn
side is right ouly the future can
detremine.
Uitford Pinchot, chief of tho
forestry bureau, has bad several con
ferences with tho president about the
liallinger restorations. Mr Pint-hot
is said to entertain tbo liveliest fear
that bel'oro tbo geological survey can
finish its work the trust will have got
hold of the best sites on the restored
laud. The president, howevor, feels
certain that Mr Piuobot is unduly
alarmed. As for himself, he feels
tbat the geological survey engineers
will be fully üblo to locate these
sites, aud that the government, this
being done, will hiivo ample time to
sat them apart tor publio use. . .
The most common cause of suffering
Kheurnatisrn causes more pain and
Eufl'eriug than any other disease, for
the ruasou that it is tbo most common
of all ills, and it is certainly gratify
ing fo sutferers'to know that Cham
berlain's Liniment will niford ielief,
and liisiko rest and sleep possible.
In many cases tbe relief from pain,
which is at llrst temporary, has be
come permanent, while iv old people
subject to chronic rheumatism, often
brought on by dampness or changes
in the weather, a permanent cure can
not be expected; the relief from pain
which this liniment affords is alone
worth many times its cost. 25 aud

; , A ;.. fettlliziDp enrtb IllJod with
nitrifying bacteria has 'been cheaply
prepared by the director cf the
Prague experiment station, Htoklaen,
and four tons of this novel fertilizer
applied to the anre have increased
crops one-third. This material was
suggested by tbe somewhat disap
pointing results of sowing bacteria
cultures direct upon tbe land. Nitro
gen ia assimilated by plants only in
the form of nitrates, and recent in
vestigators have shown that the nitiic
aoid is produced in orgnuin matter in
decay by the agency of. cettain
baoteria. Btoklasa concluded that
when laboratory cultures of the
bacteria are scattered dirent upon a
Held they become less prolific, while
they are in too small number to ac
complish all that has been expected,
lie therefore made a culture liquid
of 2 parts of gluolose, 1 5 part of car
bonate of lime and 1-2U part of
phosphate of potassium in 100 parts
of water, and added a few drops nf
pure cultures of Radiobacter and
Aztpbaoter, very ' active nitrifying
baoteria. When the bacteria bad till
ed tbe liquid, tbe wbule was sprinkl
ed over a heap nf prepared earth,
consisting of 2,500 parts of . ordinary
soil mixed w.itb 50 of dephospbora
tiou elag and moistened with 100
parts of molaHsos in 100 of water.
Tbia earth fertilizer was used after a
few days, and tbe results proved tbat
passing through the two media had
quite aaolimated the baoteria to the
soil of tbe Hold.

THE PRESIDENCY.
A Defect In the Law In the Matter of
Succession.
Tli(> langunxc of the constitution is
Keiioi'ully well chosen, but In the mtU
tcr of (he presidential succession It la
defective. Had It said the vice presi
dent shall succeed to the presidency
in case of a vacancy In that olllcp this
would have Included all sorts of vn-
COticlei mid have ! left no room for
question. As it enumerates a vacancy
from one of four causes— "the death,
resignation, Inability or removal of the
prcKldont"— lt leaves n doubt whether
a vacancy arising from unothcr cause
viz, the death of tbe president elect—
Would entitle the vice president elect
to" succeed.
The death of both president and vice
president elect would leave the suc
cession still more doubtful. An argu
ment can be mado for a line of suc
cession through the holdover members
of the cabinet of tbe retiring president,
but It Is not absolutely conclusive. It
probably would not satisfy everybody
and thereby create n disputed title. It
might even cause very serious trouble,
mid congress should take the necessary
action to make tbe presidential suc
cession absolutely clear and certain in
cvory contingency. • The late Senator
Hour labored for many years to get
this matter set at rest. Senator Dncon
has taken It up ufresh, admonished of
Its necessity, possibly In the very wide
discussion of this question since the
election. It is a weak spot in our gov
ernmental organization which congress
should strengthen and make secure
without further delay. — Philadelphia
Press.
An Obstinate Old Bachelor.
The Right Rev. Cosmo Gordon
Lanp, archbishop designate of York,
was one of the late Queen Victoria's
favorite preacliers. On one occasion
when Dr. Lang was visiting Osborne
her majesty said to him: "I hear ex
cellent reports of your work at Port
sea, and I find you actually keep a
staff ctt twelve curates. You should
take to yourself a wife. I believe you
would be able to do with two curates
less." "Ah, no, madam," he replied.
% "Thnt would scarcely do. If I have
a curate who does not suit I can get
rid of him, but I could not do tbe
same with a wife." "True," replied
the queen, "but take the advice of an
old woman and marry." Dr. Lang,
however, has not up to the present
followed the kindly counsel.— London
Tit-Bits.
Lord's Prayer on a Pin Head.
iMr.Wllliam L. Stuart, a young man
engaged In business In 'New York city,
has performed the seemingly Impossi
ble feat of engraving the entire Lord's
Prayer on the head of an ordinary pin,
to which he has added Ills name and
the year, making altogether 27i! letters
and figures. Mr. Stuart did the work
at odd thnus during his regular em
ployment and with very ordinary tools,
which seemingly are not adapted to
such line engraving. Tbe pin was set
in a block of wood, and a common en
graver's tool was used. A simple mi
croscope, costing only about '.25 cents
and known as n "linen tester," fur
nished the necessary magnifying.— St.
Nicholas.
Restrictions In New York Society.
The lines drawn by tho different
sets are more rigid In Now York than
ever before. There is a rush of vow
people to get into society, anil old
families who have stayed away for a
decade or a generation are coming
back and trying to assume their old
places. Sometimes victories have to
be accomplished with the aid of the
nouveau rlehe, and the results are
quite confusing and yet laughable.
Localities do not count as much as
they once did, and gradually New
York is getting. away from the Phil
adelphia idea of fencing in a smni
territory- and condemning every ono
who Jlyes outside of It.— Vogue

Bakers in Germany are fond of mak

twist which for size at least has surely
rarely been equaled. Weighing no
less than 180 pounds, It had a breadth
of 1.70 meters and a length of 3.20

EMMA LEDOUX
GETS NEW TRIAL
For Murder of McVicar.
From S. V, Call.
Mrs Huiwn LoDoux, the "trunk
murderess" of Stockton, may yet
lose the gruesome nud unsought diaj
tinction ot liuiiju tbe first wotnuu
banged by an order of court in Ibis
stiilu. This utiusmil deteudaut,
. coquette as v girl mid enohuutress ns
a woman, whh yesterday granted a
new trial by the supremo court.
Onco agiiin mutt sliii faco tho charge
of having murdered her ono timo
liusbniid, Albert N. MaVicar, in
Stockton, March 21, 1900.
Associate Justice Henshaw wroto
tin) decision gioutiug her a new trial,
Assonmte .luatico Lorigan and Melvin
concurring. Uniof Justice Uoatty
wrote a concurring opinion.
The grounds on which tho new trial
is ordorod are that Judgo W. 13.
Nutter, tbe trial judge, did not allow
tbe ohallonge to the pauel of tbe jury
because of the bias ot the, shcrilf.
that tbe court refused to allow in
structions of tbe defeuso ori the pre
sumption of innocence .where, con
flicting presumptions might be said
to Briso,and that pbysicmus bad been
allowed to testify as experts without
proporiy contiuiug their testimony to
hypothetical questions. in tho ap
peal it was not ooutended that the
evidence was insufficient to sustain
the verdict and judgment, tho com
plaint being entirely directed at the
rulings ot Judge Nutter. It is said
that i nl ly 1,200 objections were noted
■ in the trial.
The decision sets forth tbat during
tho ompaneliug of the jury the court
ordered a special venire of 75. Tbe
defense challenged tbe venire under
section lOUI of t.ho penal code account
of tbe bias and prejudice ot sheriff
Sibley. The evidence showed tbat
tbe sberitf bad been gathering evid
ecne and "had thus come to enter
tain an unqualified opinion tbat the
defendant was guilty." So far as the
challenge for bias is concerned, the
sberitf in such a case is put by the
law precisely in tbe position of a
trial juror and a state of mind which
would disqualify a juror equally dis
qualifies tbe sheriff.
In reference to certain love letters
written by the defendant to her hus
band, Eugene LeDoux, who lived
iisar tbe borne of her mother, Mrs
Mary Head, near Jackson, Arnador
county, it was held that while the
possession of those letters was il
legally secured, the redress was not
in tbe exclusion of pertinent evi
dence obtained by tbe seizure. The
letter* were, therefore, held to have
been properly admitted.
In tbe trial it developed tbat tbe
defendant, when she was Kmma Colo,
aged 16, married Charles liarrott,
with whom she lived four years.
After divorcing him, she married
William Williams, with whom slio
wont to Arizona. After six years of
-married life he died,, and three
months later she married MoVicar in
Ulsbee. Ariz., Jn 1902. J'bey after
wards separated and she went to her
mother's home near Jackson. In
August, 1905. she went with Eugene
IjoDoux, who resided neur her
mother's place, to Woodland, Yolo
county, where they were married by
a justice of tbe peaoe.
The prosecution urged as a motive
for tbe murder tbat she bad killed
MoVlo&r beoause of her affection for
le Doux and her desire to avoid the
exposure of her bigamous relations,
it appearing tbat she bad never been
divorced from MoVicar. The prose
cution introduced the license aud
curtiihiate of marriage . from Hisbee
over , the objection of tbe defense.
The opinion holds that in an effort to
prove bigamy the license and tho
certificate would not have been ad
missible, but to prove motive for tbe
murder they were. ,
Tbe orlme tor whloh Mrs LeUoux
was convicted was uuusual in tbe
anuala of oriino. Her remarkable
composure from tbe time of the mur
der to tbe present has stamped her as
a psyobologioHl pbeuomeuou. This
woman who, at the age of 32 yeaie,
still retained her ohaiin of fuoe aud
figure despite her vurlod life, which
took ber for a time to tbe lowest
levels, fin lied graotuußly in tbe. court'
room a minute after the jury bad pro
nounoed the verdict that she uiuet
hang. During ber three years in tbe
Han .loaquiu comity j'ul she has been
its must cbeerfull prisoner. She has
found again uiuuy of these utveet
traits which nmdo her greatly ad
mired ns a uiil.
'Hid mnrdor itself was attended
witb circumstances which developed
j the rims cnmnoßUie ot the "trunk
murderess. " It was I linn March 11.
lUOO, tbat AlnVicar, wbo was tnnn em
ployed as n Uiniiunniiii nl Jamestown,
met her by nppointment nt Stockton.
J'liiiy registered at the (/iilil'ornin
bntel ns A. N. McVicnr nnd wife and
occupied tbe same room in which bo
waa atli-r ward!) to meet bis rlutit.h.
Tbe next dny they purchased house
hold furniture and ordered it shipped
fo Jamestown. They theu came to
Snn Francisco, leaving for Jnmustown
Maroh 15. Ou Wednesdny, Match 21,
MoViCHr quit work and drew 81GIJ
duo him. Two dtiys later they weut
to Stockton, the woman explninins
that bo bad been nft'ored v position
ty ber mother. lhoy ngnia visited
the furniture store and then ordered
Mood's shipped to Amndor county,
she giving tho consignee's uame as
"my brother in law" Ijugeno Lo-
Doux, wbo was really the man she
liiul Hiiirriod at Woodland.
That night AlcVicar bought two
or tbroo Husks of wbiatty and n )lt{ht
was seen in tboir ruom until l!i:H0
o'clook. She was seen in the corridor
rarly tho next morning. She bought
tho trunk at 10 o'clock. Sbe also
bought more furniture and a rope' for
tho truuk. She even sent nn express
man to the station for her suitcase
and bought a hat and wearing ap
paid, Sbe sent a telegtatn at 2
o'clock to Joseph J louly of San Fran
cisco to meet her m this city.
The expressman roporl tho trunk
for h or and delivered it at the
station. She first inquired about it
at tbe station aud thon forgot to
check it. Tbo truuk was placed in
tbe 4 o'clock train to Snn Franoisco,
but soon removed when it was found
that it bad not been cbecked. Tbat
evening, the station baggage mat),
who had noted tbe unusual thumping
of the body in the trunk and detect
ed the ordor of a dond bjdy, notified
the police aud tbe body was discover

Francisco, met Liealy nnd registered
as M. T. Williams. Tbe next day abe
bought a ticket for Htooktou, but -got
off tbe train at Autiouh, registering
there ns Mrs Jones. The next day
sbe was arrested.
Married at Monterey.
Miss Mildred Adams, daughter of
Mr and Mrs Alex Adams, formerly of
Pine Grove, was married in New
Monterey, ou Sunday last, to
Charles Colburn, who is junior
partner and bookkeeper ot tbe Mer
cantile Company of New Monterey.
The Monterey Daily Cypress of the
18th says of this event:
It was a delightful event at the
home of Mr and Mrs O. P. Colburn
ou llollinnu avenue, New Monterey
on Sunday, when their eon, Cbailes
Colburn, and Miss Mildred Adams,
daugbtei of Mrs Dora Adams, whose
home Is In Stockton, in the ptesence
of relatives and friends stand lug be
neath a marriage bell in all its lloral
splendor, in clear distinct voices,
pledged their vows.
Key. W. J. Clifford of tbe Presby
turian church in his most impressive
manner pronounced tbe words that
made them husband and wife.
I'be bride was charming in an ex
quiiste gown of pale lavender silk,
dalntly trimmed in a darker shade
of embroidered net. She worn orange
blossoms and cariied a bouquet of
the same tied with white ribbon.
Ibe groom wore tbe conventional
suit with a boutenair of orange bads.
The decorations were tastefully ar
ranged with great care by loving
friends. The parlor was lovely in
white Lamarque roses and ferns. The
other rooms were all aglow with
bright colors. In every corner clusters
of tbe fragrant flowers were visible.
'J he bride is a very attractive young
lady. Having spent tnuob of her
time here she endeared herself to
those who bad tbe pleasure of know
ing her. Tbe grootu is an only child,
an enterprising young man of much
merit, junior partner aud bookkeeper
in tbe Mercantile Company .ot New

Do Your Clothes Fit;
Watcb tbe men as they walk along

some don't. It's all tbe way a suit
fits. A well fitted garment always
attracts attention. It isn't easy to

built differently. Jt lakes skill to
do it.. VVUeu men's clothes don't fit
tbe idea ia conveyed tbat somebody
is trying to save money in the wrong

of the word. Talent is modled in
every line. There is smartness, ele
gance and grace in every movement.
A good suit ia always an investment,
not an expense. Try Wm. Koss, tbe
