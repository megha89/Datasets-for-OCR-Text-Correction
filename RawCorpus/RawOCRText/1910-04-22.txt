/Winer Has Arm Broken
E. Simoncini, a young Austrintn
miner employed at the Argonaut mine,
met with a very painful accident about
11 :30 yesterday morning.
According to his story, a blast had
been set off Wednesday night and
timbers had been set in the north raise
of the 3100 drift, and he was in the act
of holding to a set of timbers and pick
ing up into loose rock when without any
warning a large hunch of rock dropped
upon him, almost covering his body,
bruising his head and back, and break
ing his arm directly below the elbow.
The young man was immediately sent
to the surface, and Dr. Gall summoned,
who dressed the injured arm and drove
him to his place of residence at the
Broawday hotel, South Jackson.
LAID TO HER
FINAL REST
Mrs- Isabella Sanguinetti
of Jackson. Buried
Wednesday
A message was received early Mon
day morning to the effect that Mrs Isa
bella Sanguinetti died in San Francisco
at an early hour that morning. The
fatal termination was not unlooked for,
as a message had been received the pre
vious day to the effect that the end was
a question of only a few hours, and
those who were desirous of seeing her
again in life would have to leave for the
city immediately. The deceased was
taken to the city over a month ago for
treatment for a complication of troubles,
accompanied by nartial paralysis of the
limbs. The doctors there, however,
were unable to repair the inroads which
disease had made upon her system, and
she steadly grew worse, and her condi
tion become such that it was deemed
dangerous to attempt to make the '-trip
back to her home in this city, which
was desired by the patient and the
members of her family. The remains
were brought to Jackson Monday, and
the funeral was held on Wednesday.
Deceased was a native of New York, 63
years of age. She leaves a family of
five children, three sons, and two daugh
ters, namely, Frank V. Lawarence and
John Sanguinetti, Miss Dooley Sangui
netti and Mrs George L. Thomas, all
residents of Jackson, beside a number
of grandchildren. Also two sisters, Mrs
C Soracco. and Mrs JMary Solari, both of
SutterCreek ; two brothers, one of whom
is in Italy, and the other Ben White of
Amador City.
The funeral took place on Wednesday
morning at 10 :30 a. m. from the late
residence 71 Main street. The Native
Sons and Daughters of the golden west
attended in a body, and lined both sides
of Main street to await the last march
with their departed loved one. At 10:30
the funeral cortege proceeded to St.
Patrick's church, where a requiem mass
was celebrated by Father Laffan. At
the conclusion of mass, Rev. Laffan
most beautifully described the character
of the departed soul, and also urged his
hearers to prepare for the long journey,
which they all must make, quoting,
"For it is appointed unto men once to
die." The cortege then proceeded to
the Catholic cemetery, where the last
rites at the grave were said, and the
body laid to rest beside that of her
departed husband in the family plot.
The grave was beautifully decorated,
being lined with white cloth, and the
ground surface covered with ferns,
bridal wreaths, and flags. The floral de
signs were gorgeous, and represented
nearly every design that is commonly
set.
The pall bearers were: U. S.
Gregory, Chas. Kelley, E. Ginocchio,
V. Garbarini,' A. Basso, A. Caminetti.
There were 10 carriages in line carry
ing relatives and friends, and a double
line of citizens afoot extending from
the church to the residence.
Deceased was one of the pioneers of
the, county. She came to Amador
county with her parents in 1853, being
then only six years of age. Her l"us
band, who svith two others engaged in
gravel mining in early days in the v;
cinity oi Jackson Gate, died i'abaut 25
years ago. Deceased leave a valuable
estate, consisting of business property
on Main street in this city.

THE LINCOLN
CONSOLIDATED
Company to Reopen Well
Known Properties in
Sutter Creek.
Tne Lincoln Consolidated Mining
Company lias been organized and the
company has contracted to buy outright
a big tract of mining land extending
from near the foot of Lincoln Hill to
near the Keystone reservoir. The area
Is over three hundred acres and em
braces such well known properties as the
Lincoln Mine, West Lincoln, Stewart
Mine, and lowa Aline, also the old Isola
mine and other adjacent properties, In
Sutter Creek district.
W. J, McGes has been aj work for
over nine years in getting the title to
these various properties cleared and
consolidating them into a unit. There
were many suits, sales, probate pro
ceedings, contending interests and
delinquent taxes that had to be taken
care of. The expenses of litigation and
delinquent taxes on the Lincoln alone
amounted to over $3000. Then there
were the miners' liens on the property
that had to be discharged, and^ the
claims of the old stockholders that had
to be satisfied. But it is now claimed
that the titles to all the properties have
been cleared with the single exception
of the Stewart mine and a suit is now
pending to quiet title to this claim. All
of the properties are to be deeded out
right to the Lincoln Consolidated' Min
ing Company and the owners are to take
their pay in stock with the understand
ing that the company is to spend 8100,
000 in developing the mines.
The fact that the managers of the
three biggest dividend paving mines in
the county, Messrs Rainsford, Smith
and Schmal, are directors of the project
is a splendid recommendation for it.
We understand that they with Julius
Chichizola, will represent the investors
on the bord of directors and the former
owners will have one representative en
the board in the person of Mr McGee.
the properties arc all well located on
the Mother Lode, and there are dividend
payers north and south of them. They
are no doubt worthy of development.
The opening of these mines will mean
much for Sutter Creek and Amador
county.
Bill Passer Not Tried.
E. Braehero, who is confined in the
county jail awaiting trial on a charge of
passing worthless confederate money,
has not bean arraigned in the superior
court yet. There is a question about
the grade of the offense, whether a felony
or misdemeanor. It is likely that a
plea of guilty of misdemeanor may be
accepted.

MINE NEWS
ALONG LODE
Big Body of Rich Gravel
Ore Is Discovered
Near Volcano %
Denend Gravel Claim
A fine channel of pay gravel has been
discovered on the Denend claim, above
Volcano. The claim is located on a
small gulch leading in to Sutter creek.
While the bed of the main creek has
been exploited for gold through its
entire length und width, there are many
spots in the side gulches close to the
creek that escaped the prospectors of
early times. The auriferous gravel un
c;vered in the Denend mine is one of
these SDots. The gold-bearing gravel
is reported to be from six to ten feet
wide, and they took out over §300 in
side of two weeks, all In coarse gold,
picked up from the bed rock, without
a general clean up of the sluices. Some
of the nuggets weighed from 85 to 810
each. There seems to be a considerable
body of rich gravel. The mine is operat
ed by drifting, nnd ground sluicing into
a string of sluice boxes.
Argonaut
The Argonaut mine reports another
new find on the 2800 level 000 feet south
of main ore shoot. The new find has
been opened up a distance of 30 feet
and shows an elegant grade of pay ore.
This ore body is expected to be en
countered again on the 3000 level where
it will be prospected for. The lowest
drift in the mine is the 3300 feet. The
shaft however has a depth of 3400 feet.
This mine has a very' bright outlook,
and promises to hold much good for
future developments about Jackson.
Bunker Hill
This mine paid its regular monthly
dividend of five cents per share on the
15th, amounting to 810,000. On Satur
day last the drift that has been run at
tho 1950 level to strike the main ledge
at that point was' just entering the rim
of the ore body, and at any time there
after it was thought the ledge might be
broken into. All indications were
favorable for continuance of the fine
showing met with in the 1750 level,
which has opened cut even better than
the most sanguine expectations, had pre
dicted. The clean up for last month
was about the same as the month before,
leavinp, a gocd surplus after paying the
monthly dividend.
Kennedy
For last month the Kennedy company
paid a dividend of twenty-tive cents per
share, amounting to 825,000, represent
ing the net profits of the month's run.
This would indicate a probable gross
yield of between $50,000 and $Cio,ooo for
the 100 stamp mill, which is flattering
showing for that many stamps. Ths
Kennedy is the only mine in the history
of Amador county that gave employment
to that many stamps. And they have been
kept running steadily since the big mill
started eight years ago, eating up about
500 tons of ore per day.
Superintendent Smith of the Kennedy
mine has gone to San Francisco for a
few days to attend the monthly meeting
of the directors of the mine.
Keystone
This mine is running along steadily,
the company is faced with financial
problems to furnish ready money with
which to meet pressing obligtions, and
pay the wages of employes. Everything
on the surface and In connection with
the machinery is in excellent order.
The mine was never better equipped to
handle ore than now. The urgent need
seems to be development work. It is
a comparatively shallow mine. Fifteen
hundred feet is the deepest point
reached, although it has been in contin
uous operation from the inauguration of
quartz mining in Amaqdor in pioneer
days. During a large portion of this
time it has held the foremost place as a
gold producer. There is nodoubt in the
opinion of expert miners that it would
resume its place in Ihe front rank if
developed to greater depth.
NO WILDCAT MINING
IN AMADOR COUNTY
There is nothing in the shape of wild
catinij in the mining industry of Amador
county. That term of opprobrium is
used to designate that class o!" fraudu
lent operatious conducted by the get
rich-quick, whose object is to take gold
from the pockets of the over-credulous
investors, rather than from nature's
storehouse in the bowels of the earth.
Too often schemes uf this kind are
based upon lands labeled as mines

which arc many miles from any proven
mineral field, and which show no
mineral indications worth mentioning.
Such fake mining propositions are
floated to swindle people, and without
any idea of embarking in legitimate
mining. Any enterprise that aims to
prospect any portion of the mother lode
region of Amador Co., from Mokelumne
clear through to the Cosumnes river, a
distance of over 20 miles, is legitimate
mining ground, anH any prospecting
along that lode is in proper mining
business.
It matters little whether the property
proposed to be worked is an old mine,
which has been operated in early days,
and abandoned as unprofitable or for
lack of funds. Such expenditures fur
nishes no reason for condeminc its re
opening as a wildcat scheme. The his
tory of Amador county is full of in
stances where mines idle for long years,
and which were deemed unremunerative
by the former operators, have proved
grand paying ventures upon further de
velopment. Indeed, the best paying
mines on the lode have passed through
such experiences. The Kennedy, Cen
tral Eureka, Argonaut, Zeila, Bunker
Hill, Fremont, and even the Keystone,
have had their periods of ups and
downs. And yet these are working
properties to-day, the very life of the
mining industry, and several of them
rank as marvels of profitable mining.
Any effort to work any part of the lode
line should be encouraged.
There have been in the past, and pro
bably will be again, methods followed
in operating mines, here as elsewhere,
which are not commendable. Lack of
tlie necessary capital to develop a pro
perty may be the cause, rather than a
purpose to deceive. In fact, we con
sider that the expenditure of money at
any point on the main gold bearing belt
running through Amador county, is an
evidence of good faith in a very pro
mising field and is worthy of encourage
ment. Capital no doubt has been un
wisely spent, owing to extravagant
ideas, or poor management. The best
mineral fields the world has ever known
has been written with more failures
than successes. And the failures in
Amador county are probably below
rather than above the average.
Treasure
This mine, situated on Rancheria
creek, between the Bunker Hill and
Fremont mines, is being equipped with
the necessary machinery to sink 1000
feet deeper, which will carry the shaft
to a total depth cf 1500. The develop
ments so far indicate a good paying
mine within this ground, and the owners
in<end to develop it in thorough-going
manner.
BIG LIME
ENTERPRISE
Company td Organize
With a Capital Stock
of $75,000
A meeting was held Wednesday eve
ning by the promoters of the proposed
lime enterprise near Mt. Echo. The
gathering was held in Jackson, and for
the purpose of taking steps to place the
movement on a working basis. Those
present were W. J-L Greenhalgh, chair
man, A. Ginocchio, G. W. Brown,
John Strohm, Jake Newman of Itne,
and R. Webb. It was decided to at
once organize as an incorporated com
pany with a capital stock of $75,000,
divided into 75,000 shares at SI per
share. A committee of three consisting
of R. Webb, Geo. W. Brown and John
Strohm was selected to draw up the
necessary articles of incorporation, and
to submit the same for signatures at
another meeting to be held A\ay 4th.
Stock amounting to over $30,000 shares
was disposed of at the meeting. The
organization will-- be pushed along as
speedily as possible from now on.
The matter of building^an aerial line
from the Gebhardt quarry to a point on
the Amador branch below lone was dis
cussed. The line would be over four
miles in length. It was, as far as the in
formation at present obtainable held the
most economical and feasible method of
transporting the product to the railroad.
This question will be looked into
thoroughly before a final decision is
readied. The company has an option
on over 30'J acres of land bearing laryo
deposits of the finest lime rock to be
found anywhere In the stcte. Everything
looks favorable for carrying the enter
prise to a successful issue. The in
tention is to furnish an equipment
sufficient to deliver about 200 tons per
day to the depot.BftCRRED At Tllß niSTorncß AT JACRSOK AR SCCOND-CLASs' MATTER.

Editorial Column
FLOOD OF CAMPAIGN LITERATURE.
At this time we are flooded with a deluge of literature from
the different bureaus established for the purpose of booming
the various candidates on the republican side for nomination
for state offices. All these literary bureaus are in full swing
from the governorship clear down the list of positions to be
filled at the coming election. The communications are in
the nature of a request to advocate the claims df some particu
lar aspirant for office. No doubt every country editor is
favored to a greater or less degree with the same avalanche
of boosting applications. Under the new primary law the
country press assumes a very important place in the'estims
tiou of aspirants. The dethronement of bossism in party
ranks means that a direct appeal must be made to the indi
vidual voter for support, and this can be clone most effectual
ly through the influence of the press. Hence this flood of
campaign literature from the headquarters of the respective
candidates. It must be evident to the managers of the candi
dates that if the newspapers were to attempt to comply with
these requests, even in so far as the personal preferences
of their respective editors are concerned, an internal strife
would thereby be inaugurated within the party ranks that
would prove likely a handicap at the general electiou in No
vember. The large dailies cannot be beguiled into the
adoption of tbis unwise policy. A few, it is true, are boosting
favorite sons for nomination, but as a rule the! city press is
taking no hand in the preliminary skirmishing. Perhaps for
this reason the effort to get . the country weeklies to force the
issue is waxing so pronounced. But the country press is in
clined to be as conservative as the big dailies, and this class of
personal literature is generally consigned to the capacious
maw of the waste basket. If attention were paid to this. mass
of contributions, the columns of the average weekly journal
would be freighted with such notices to the exclusion of more
important topics. At the outset of the new primary law the
party papers would do well to reach an undertanding to keep
aloof from contests for nomination honors. It is certainly
in the interest of" the republican ticket that is eventually pre
sented for ratification in November that as little friction as
possible be created by personal fights for place on the ticket.
The Ledger is for the republican nominees as determined by
the primary election. We may have our preferences based
on our judgment of the relative strength and fitness of the
rival aspirants, but we deem it advisable to keep such pre
ferences out of print until the voters have spoken. The
success of the party is of far more importance than the person
nel of the standard-bearer. The party is bigger than any in
dividual member, or any faction contending for supremacy.
v It is reported that heretofore well-known democrats iv vari
ous parts of the state are enrolling on the great registers as
republicans. This movement is noticed in near-by counties,
but has not developed to any extent in Amador county. This
apparent drift from democracy is looked upon with sus
picion, and comment is indulged in as to the impelling mo
tive. Coming at the first trial of the direct primary law, the
inference is that these voters heretofore allied with the op
posite party are anxious to take a hand in the selection of
the republican ticket, and to this end are willing to forego
partipation in the make-up of the ticket of their heretofore
political faith. The question is; asked whether this drift is
designed to aid the democrats by an effort to foist a weak
■candidate upon the republicans. This reprehensible method
is not a new thing in party politics, although revolting to
one's sense to right, and a plain violation of the spirit and
letter of the election laws. Another version is that it is
planned in republican circles to help one or the other faction
in scoring a victory at the primaries. This explanation is
just as discreditable as the other. In either case it shows
that the primary law is just as open to attack from the pro
fessional politician as the convention system. The opinion
is freely expressed that that the new way of selecting candi
dates will be more disappointing from a good-government
standpoint than the old.
A QUEER MOVE.
Hyde Murder Trial
Begun at Kansas City
The trial of Dr. B. C. Hyde for the
murder of Thomas H. Swope, millionair
philanthropist and uncle of his wife, has
begun before Judge Ralph S. Latshaw at
Kansas City. Eleven indictments were
returned against Dr. Hyde by the special
grand jury, which spent ten days In
vestigating every angle of the alleged
murder. One indictment '-as for the
murder of Thomas H. Swopo; one for
the murder of the millionaire's n?phew,
Chrisman Swope, and the remainder for
alleged attempts to inoculate members
of the Swope family with typhoid bac
teria. On the result of the legal battle,
will hinge the action of the law in re
gard to the other ten indictments
Should Dr Hyde be acquitted of the
murder of Colonel Swope the other
indictments, in all probability, will be

OVERTAXED.
Hundreds of Jackson Readers Know
What It Means.
The kidneys are overtaxed;
Have too much to do.
They tell about it in many aches and
pains —
Backache, sideache, headache,
Early symptoms of kicinev ills.
Urinary troubles, diabetes, Bright's
disease follow.
A Jackson citizen tells here the way
to keep the kidneys well.
Mrs Eva Bastian, Church st., Jack
son, Cal., says: "1 suffered severely
from kidney trouble for a long time.
My kidneys were disordered and the
secretions so frequent in passage as to
cause me much annoyance. The pain
in my back was so severe that 1 could
not sleep at night, and if I attempted to
turn over. I was in misery. 1 tried
liniments and plasters, and also used a
great many remedies but did not find
satisfactory relief until I learned of
Doan's Kidney Pills and procured a box
at the City Pharmacy. 1 received great
relief from the fi<-st, and I continued
taking them until 1 was restored to good
health.
For sale by all dealers. Price 50
cents. Foster-Mi lburn Co., Buffalo,
New York, sole agents for the United
States.
Remember the name— Doan's— and
take no other.
Saved from the Grave
"I had about given up hope, after
nearly four years of suffering from a
severe lung trouble," writes Mrs M. L.
Dix, of Clarksville. Term. "Often the
pan in my chest would be almost un
bearable and 1 could not- do my work,
but Dr. King's New Discovery has
made me feel like a new person. Its
the best medicine made for the throat
and 'ungs. " Obstinate coughs, stubborn
colds, hay fever, la grippe asthma,
croup, bronchitis and hemorrhages,
hoarseness and whooping cough, yield
quickly to this wonderful medicine.

Large Traction Engine
Jas B. and Matt Blair made an exten

week, and while seeing a good deal of
country, transacted some business which
will mean much to their lumbering en
terprise in this county. Last Thursday
they went via Coloma and Cool to Au
burn, where they -spent the night at the
Ernest Birdsal olive farm on Aeolia
Heights. Friday they went to Sacra
mento, and "on Saturday to Stockton,
where they closed a deal for a 810,000
70 horse-power traction engine, which
they expect to have in operation by the
10th of May, between their new mills
on Plum Creek and their lumber yards
in this city. The engine is one of the
newest design in that class of machines,
and weighs 50.000 pounds. Mr. Paul
Weston an expert engineer who formerly
ran a traction engine in this county,
was here a few weeks ago, and went
over the ground with Mr Blair and it
was decided that a machine such as the

the streets all stop to eat. And In
general It may be said that iv- all
places and at all hours It is good form
and a matter of course to draw out a
substantial sandwich of rye bread and
raw ham and go to munching. Wom

Dinner comes at 2 o'clock. About 5
the maid brings to your room coffee

A Mining Accident
An accident occurred at the South'
Eureka mine early Thursday morning,
so we are reliably informed, which very
fortunately was unattended by iniury to
any of the miners. In hoisting the
night shift, the wire cable broke when
the skip, loaded according to report,
with about fifteen men, was about 1000
feet from the top. Luckily the skip
jumped the track after going down only
two or three feet, and caught- on the
timbers of the shaft. The 1000 feet of
wire rope descended on the men who
were being hoisted, but did no damage
of consequence. It is a rule with all
mining companies to inspect the cables
frequently, so as to detect any weakness
therein. But in spite of tlw utmost pre
caution in this respect, it is next to im
i possible sometimes to detect a weak
ness. The exterior may appear perfect
ly sound, while the interior wi'e
strands may be corroded An accident
of this nature does not necessarily im
ply a lack of attention in the examina
tion of the working condition of the
■cable.
Young Austrian Meets
Violent Death in Mine
A young Austrian miner named
George Vucurovich met a violent death
in the Lightner mine at Angels Camp
on Tuesday last. While at work in the
face he came across a stick of giant
powder that had failed to explode, strik
ing it and thereby causing it to explode.
The debris struck him about the face
and hdsd, causing almost instant death,
and mangling him in a terrible manner.
The remains were brought jto Jackson
yesterday, and will be interred in the
cemetery of the Greek church this
afternoon, under the auspices of the
Austrian Benevolent Society, of which
organisation ne was a member. He was
23 years of age, and for a while was
employed at the Zeila mine. Some
difficulty arose upon the arrival of the
body here owing to the absence of a
certificate as to the cause of death. ; It
appears a jury was impanneled to hold a
coroner's inquest, and after viewing the
remains.and before the inquest was held,
the body was forwarded here. When
the facts were known there was no fur
ther objection to the interment.

thereby. To one who has spent many
years in this country, the conditions in

Miner Severely injured
A miner named John Gillbard, resid
ing with Thomas L'emin of Jackson,
met with an accident last night about 10
o'clock, on ths "2700 level in the
Argonaut mine, which micht have re
sulted in his death. While setting
timbers with a fellow workman, several
tons of loose ore dropped upon the
workmen, knocking them down. Gill
bard, however, ' was the only one v
seriously injured, receiving a large sash
above the eye, and his shoulder arms
and legs were cut and bruised. Dr.
Gall was summoned and dressed the in
jured man.

BALL GAME
DRAWS CROWD
Lack of Team Work Is
Cause of Jackson's
Defeat
Jackson's base ball nine crossed bats
with the city's second team last Sunday
afternoon, and were defeated by a score
of Bto 5. The game was interesting
throughout, and was hughely enjoyed by
a crowd large enough to more than pack
the grand stand.
Following is the score for the Jackson
first and second base hall teams.

As the team's manager has now gotten
together a team with every indication of
being able to develop into a fast set it is
to b2 hoped that liberal patronage will
be shown them, both in the shape of
tickets and rooting, for all ball teams
are subjected to more or less expense,
and all teams need their enthusiastic
rooters. It might be well to caution the
few wooly brained rooters that are found
on all grounds, to refrain fro n personal
cutting remarks, as that kind of rooting
only tends toward giving the town an ill
n ame< and throws a wrong reflection
often times on the team itself.
The present line up is a well selected
crowd of clean gentlemen base ball men,
who are fully able to defend the county
seat's title and who 1 we trust will be
supported throughout the season.
While the Second team deserves full
credit for its victory, still it must bs re
membered that they had a severe tryo»t
the week previous with Slitter Creek,
and suffered defeat, and that this was
the 'big boys' initial game.
Kerr, Cramer, N. Vela and Brown are
fine material for any team,' and showed
elegant team work when crowded. Calvin
is dependable in left field and by two
very pretty catches in his territory ; he
greatly assisted his nine to victory. E.
Leach was struck by a pitched ball the
effect of which nearly put the fast little
short stop out of the game and causing 3
errors to be scored against him. T.
Leach who was injured in the Slitter
Creek gama held down the 3d mat and
although Thaddeus had a hard time in
keeping his sky piece in place, he
always managed to take care of the ball
when it came his direction.
G. Vela, Arditto, Delaliide and Boro
played good ball for the Jackson nine.
Kirby who caught part of the game ap
pears to understand the duties, but seem
to have an off day, and failed to hold in
his balls. Myers who pitched the game
deserves credit but also appears to, have
over confidence in himself, which hurts
many promising young pitchers. That
he can make good there is no question,
and a few games we trust will bring out
the necessary life and ginger that makes
a game worth going to see.
On Sunday, April 24, Sutler Creek
will line up against the Jackson nine at
Zeila park. The game will be called
promptly at 2p. ni., and promises to
be an interesting match.
C. Ludekens Doing Finely
Chas Ludekens, who had his right
hand cut off at the Mitchell mine by
getting caught in the saw mill, is re
covering rapidly from the amputation of
the limb at the county hospital. He
left the hospital last Wednesday, and
will remain at the Ferrari ranch near
Butte mountain for a while, so as to be
within easy reach of the doctor, who
will visit him every day or two, for the
present.
Bazaar Planned.
On May 14, the ladies guild of Jack
son Episcopal church have arranged to
hold a fair and baznar, and thereby en
deavor to raise funds enough to defray
certain debts which the church has con
tracted. A most novel Egyptian kettle
will be chanced off that night. The
kettle is brass, and hangs by three
chains from an antique hunger.

Cholera-Proof Hogs
A hog of the Persian variety may be
seen at Suttcr Creek,, the only one of
this species to be found in the county.
It was brought from a band of the same
kind that is kept at a ranch near Gait.
The stock was imported from Persia,
and while in size and flavor of the meat
this class of hogs will compare favorab
ly with the American product, the main
recommendation for the new breed is
that it is cholera proof. This, if true,
is a strong incentive to stock raisers.
Hog raising of late years has proven
one of the most profitable industries the
farmer can devote his attention to.
Medicines that aid nature are always
most successful. Chamberlains cough
remedy acts on this plan. It loosens
the cough, relieves the lungs, opens the
secretions and aids nature in restoring
the system to a healthy condition. Sold

Initiate lone Knight
A jolly crowd of Jackson Knights of
Pythias went to lone on Tuesday to help
initiate Fred Le Aloin in the second and
third degree of lone Lodge No. 84,
Knights of Pythias.
Fred Le Mom is an ex-superintendent
of the county hospital, and employed at
the Preston Industrial school. The
knights made the trip in a large auto,
leaving Jackson about 7 p. m.
On the return trip at 3 p. m., they
encountered a huge oak limb that had
fallen across the roadway, and which re
quired the united strength of the party
to remove.
Those who made the trip were: Dr.

Assessment Motes
County Assessor C. H. Jarvis is gct
•.ing along rapidly with the field work of
assessing. He is now at work in town
ship one, having completed the other
portion of the coun'y. He reports a
prosperous condition of affairs as a
whole. The most noticeable falling off
in value has been in the line of live
stock. The number of cattle will show
a heavy decrease, owing to the hard out
look at the begining of last fall. Feed
was short and the cattle in no condition
to face a severe winter, so many stock
men sold their cattle, or as many of
them as they possibly could, as a pre
cautionary measure, On the grant lands
around lone the shortag^ is 1700 head
as compared with last year and in other
parts the shrinkage of this class of rro
pcrtv is equally noticeable. There will
undoubtedly be a substantial iucrcase of
value of the mining industry, that will
more than make up the shortage In other
lines. The mines never looked better,
and consequently they will figure higher
on the assessment roll. The total assess
ment roll will show an increase as com
pared with last year.
NEW AUTO LINE
W. Thorp, the proprietor of the local
garage, started an auto stage line be
tween Jackson and lone last Monday.
The road between the two towns is
fairly good, somewhat. rouuh in places,
but with careful driving it is believed
the trips can be made without unreason
able wear and tear to the machine. The
stage leaves Jackson in the morning at
about half-past seven, or shortly before
the regular stage for JMarell, reaching
lone for Jackson on the arrival of the
Southern Pacific train. It leaves lone
for Jackson on the arrival of the passen
ger train, and reaches this city about the
same time as the stage from Martell.
The fare is $1.50 each way, the same as
the railroad. On the initial trip Mon
day there were two passengers for lone.
Convention of School
Superintendents
W. H. Greenhalgh. county supertn
tenden of schools left yesterday morn
ing for Riverside, at which place the
annual convention of school superinten
dents will be held next week, and will
continue in session three days. These
annual gatherings are for an interchange
of ideas concerning educational matters,
and a dicussion of needed legislation for
the promotion Df school interest. They
are deemed of sufficient importance and
benefit to be continued. The county super
intendent will return the latter part of
next week.

PALMER STUDIO
19 Main St. Jackson, Calif.
m
mLUMBER OUT
PUT STUDIED
U. S. Oept. of Agricul
ture Investigating
Industry
The U. S. Department of Agricultural
in connect. .m with a study of the wood
using industries of various States is
Itarning what part of the rouph lumber
output of our American sawmills passes
through a second process of manufacture
before it is ready for the consumer.
The study is regarded as having an im
portant bearing on the extent to which
more economical use of our forest re
sources can be brought about. So far,
the results obtained « show that more
than five-eights of the rongh lumber
sawed is to be counted as tha raw ma
terial for other industries which con
vert it into a more highly finished and
more valuable product.
In tha United States waste iv the
woods, the mill, nnd the factory is so
great that two-thirds of what was in the
tree is lost on the way to the consumer.
The heavest part of this loss takes
place in the sawmills. Much of this
mill waste is uuavoidable under present
conditions, but the greater the demand
for the product and the higher its value,
the batter will economy pay. Waste in
manufacture is very small compared
with that at the sawmill. Study of the
demaud of the wood-using industries
may be a means of finding out how the
mill may profltaby market a part of -what
now goes to the burner in sawdust,
slabs, an trimiugs.
Statisticsof the wood-using industries
of Massachusetts, Maryland, North Car
olina, aud Wisconsin, lately gathered
by the Department of Agriculture in co
operation with these States, show that of
the total sawmill output 3G per cent is
used in the form of rough lumber and C 4
per ceut is manufactured into other
fo rr.s of ouput. If the same ratio holds
for the entire counrty as for these States
about 13 billion feet of lumber is used
yearly in rough form and 23->2 billion
feet is further manufactured.
This is the first time that detailed
figures have been obtained on this sub
ject. The study which has yeilded
these figures has also in view to ascer
tain what commodities are made wholly
or partily of wood, the various kind of
wood used, their origin, and their cost,
as well as other data of value to the
growers of timber aud to the sellers and
buyers of lumber.
In making up the figures, lumber used
as bridge timbers, house frames, farm
fences, trestles, boardwalks, walls and
similar classes of structures, with only
such cuttings and' fitting as is given it
by carpenters, was classed as rough lum
ber; that made into flooring, finish,
siding sash, doors, frame;, panels,
stairs, boats, vehicles, boxes, baskets,
turnery, woodenware, cooperage, musi
cal instruments, farm implements, fur
niture, spools, handles, and like forms
was placed in the class of finished lum
ber.
The present aggregate population of
the four States is estimated by their re
spective States official to be 9,165,975;
the population of the United States in
round figures is 900,000,000 according to
recent estimates. The average lumber
cut in the four States for 1907 and 1908
-the one an active, the other a dull year
was 3,753,293,000 feet, and for the Uni
ted States it was 36,740,261,000. Cal
culated on this basis, the per capita use
of sawn lumber in the four States; was
410 feet, and in the United States 408.
The per capita use in the four States of
lumber further manufactured was 263
feet. These figures indicate a lavish use
of lumber in the United States, for our
per capita consumption is from three to
ten times that of the leading nations of
Europe.

RUNNING THE GANTLET.
An Indian Incident In Indiana's Pio-
neer Days.
Dnvld Jo''isim, v/..e of the Pftllf set
tlers of h.Jiiinu. was a noted hunter
nnd at ono time wus with n hunting
party of which John Severn* was n
member. On that occasion the curly
settlcim'nt of tlio stnto was dllCUfflftl.
Mr, Severn*, unfitly been tlieif so
iimny yean before any other white
mnu. wns OCCeptPd us Hiithorlty Oil nil

tory of liidlnim" Colonel \V. M. Cock
nun gives one of Mr. Severns' storlos
H3 repented by Mr. .lohuson.
Mr. Several mild that in Hip fall of
1703 he was with half a dozen of his
Indian neighbors, hunting, nnd that no
stayed till Might nt an, Indian Tillage.
During the night two white prisoners
were brought In. and preparations
were iniide for their trial mid deuth.
First two llhom were formed facing
encb other, nnd the two men were
compelled to run the gantlet between
the lines. A polut some- hundred
yards beyond the Hues of the gantlet
was designated ns tho pluee that was
to be reached to save their lives.
One of tho men wns of inlddlo nge,
but frail: the other wus n strong, nth
letic young fellow. The lines were
m.ade up of more than 100 Indians,
mostly squaws nnd boys, with enough
active, men to keep the prisoners from
getting nwny. The young man was
tue first to make tbe raw. He got
through tbe lane nnd to the life sta
tion without being much hurt.
The older man before he started
held up his hands and offered a prayer
to God for aid. theu commenced the
race, which was not more than half
completed before ho was knocked
down by a heavy club In the hands
of a squaw nud was sot upon by tlie
bordo of squaws and boys and beaten
to death.
As soon ns he was knocked down tho
.vouug man, who was several hundred
feet away, ran like a deer aud jumped
into the throng of Indians and tried to
save his friend's life, but was soon
overpowered and dragged away.
For this brave act tbe chief of tbe
village adopted the young roan to
take the place of a son whom he hod
lost.
Mr. Severns. on being asked why up
did not intercede for the prisoners,
said that If he Imd attempted to Inter
fere it would have cost him his life.

Streams as a Resisting Medium-
Troubles of Insulation.
The use in Germany and r.elyium of
thin belts of steel for driving machinery
has beo.n on experiment of great In
terest. The belts, as described by
Reginald Krall to British engineers, ure
made from about 1-125 to 1 -25 of an
inch thick and from about 2 to 8 inches
wide, and one G inches wide and 1-40 of
an inch thick readily transmits 200
horse-power. In manufacture two
serious obstacles have been encountered.
That of obtaining n perfectly homo
geneous steel has been overcome by a
specially-made steel, which is given a
very high temper. The problem of
making a joint has been solved by hav
ing the ends soldered at the factory by
trained men. Brazing was not very
successful, and the best results have
been obtained with a solder of melting
point low enough— not above 200 dcg.
Cent.— to have no effect on the temper.
A special steel tape, placed around the
pulleys and stretched to a predetermined
tension, is used to find the exact length
of belt needed. Bare pulleys arc soon
polished by the bar.ds, and it has been
found better to use a covering of cork
and canvas cemented to the pulleys.
These belts, showing little, wear, are
run at speeds as high as 10,000 feet a
minute.
The automatic electric passenger
elevator requires no attendant. Pres
sing the usual push button calls the
cage if not already in use, and when it
stops at the landing the door may be
unlocked and opened. It cannot start
again until a lever is moved that
closes and locks the landing door. In
the cage is] push-button for each floor
served, and on momentarily pressing
one of the buttons the cage moves to the
corresponding floor, and there stops,
when" the door may ba opened for the
passenger to alight.
In the novel farming of T. Y. Rior
dan, of London, a positive electric cir
rent of 10,000 volts or more is sent
throuhg a network of wires at a height
of 6 15 feet, and the nitric oxides pro
duced are supposed to be washed by at
moshperic moisture into lime spread on
the soil. The nitrate of lime resulting
is one of the best manures.
The honor of being the oldest mum
my, representing the most ancient em
balming, is now definitely assigned to
one Ranefer, whose remains were found
by Prof, l-'linders Petrie in 1801 near
the Medium Pyramid of King Snefru,
dating from about 2900 B. C. Though
the gteat age was recognized at once,
the mummy was deposited in the Mu
seum of the Royal College of Surgeons
in England, and practically forgotten.
This seems to have been due to the fact
that many mummies as old, and even
pre-dynastic, were reported, but a late
investigation has shown that there are
no genuine mummies in the Cairo
Museum or the British Museum earlier
than the time of the New Empire,
about 1580 B. C. Bodies embalmed
in the tenth ard twelfth dynasties— 2ooo
and 2200 B. C.-were found in 1907,
though so fragile that they could not be
moved. The Medium mummy has been
of uncertain age on account of its hav
ing been found in a plundered tomb, but
Dr. G. A. Reisner has lately made dis
coveries proving that its curious peculi
arities belong to the- time of the fifth
dynasty, about 2700 B. C. This gives
the specimen an age 500 years greater
than any other actual mummy known
and 1100 years greater than any other in
a museum.
The new sail vehicle of a German in
ventor, described by Consul T. H. Nor
ton of Chemnitz, promises good results
for speed contests and pleasure purposes
on smooth roads and sandy stretches,
like sea beaches. Unlike early clumsy
sail wagons, 'this vehicle is very light.
It has a light framework supporting a
saddle and the mast, and resting on four
wheels, one^on either side and larger
ones in front and behind, the rear wheel
ani the right side wheel being rigidly
connected, as are also the front wheel
and left side wheel. The two connect
ing bars are joined by an axle with
hinged attachment at each end. Sitting
in the saddle with his feet on the cross
axle, the rider can guide the wheels by
suitable pressure, and lus his hands free
for adjusting the sail or using a brake.
The new ingot iron, claimed to be
non-rustling, is practically pure iron.
Tested in a 25 per cent sulphuric acid
bath, in (5 hours an eyebar of this iron
lost 10.5 per cent, and one of charcoal
iron 77.3 per cent; in 5 hours a railroad
spike of the new iron lost 11.2 per
cent, and an ordinary steel spike 79.1
per cent; and in 45 minutes an ingot
iron nail lost 4.13 per cent, and a com
mon steelwire nail 68.9 per cent.
Cars on the Prussian railways—espe
cially those used for Russian traffic— are
often infested with vermin, and a new
process o' the Julius I'intsch Co. has
been adopted for destroying bedbugs,
nits, and disease germs without removal i
of cushions or fittings and without'in
jury to varnish or polish. A disinfecting,
cylinder of cast iron, IG!e feet In inside:
diameter and long enough to inclose the (
car, is used. This is closed at the ends i
by cast iron heads, and is air-tight and
capable of withstanding enormous pres
sure. The total weight Is 297,000 pounds |
The car is run into the cylinder, and]
the temperature is raised by live steam !
to 1 14 deg. to 122 deg., when the air is ;
pumped out to a pressure of one-tenth
of the normal, the heat being still main- 1
tamed, Formalin vapor is then in
troduced. In a test of the plant, the
thorough heating of tho car required
about five hours, rarefying the air took;
two hours, but disinfectin witli formalin]
was a quick process. Bed bugs and nits :
were effectually destroyed. Vestibule and
dining earn with ceilings, walls and Moors i
that had become wet through were inclos
ed,in the heated vacum for 24 hours, and
were dried in a surprisingly thorough
manner. Allowing 10 hours for the dis
infection of a car, it is estimated that
the total expense is 88.33, ot more than
a tenth of the cost of the less complete |
cleansing by the old methods.
Peculiarities in the motion of Encke's
comet have suggested the curious theory
that this body is retarded in its course
around the sun by the collision with
a meteoric ring. Soon after the comet's
period had been determined, Enckc no
ticed a gradual diminution, due to nearer
approach to the sun, and suggested that
this was an effect of slowing down by
some resisting medium in space near
the perhclion position. Dr Backlund,

Clergyman Accused
of Taking Ballots
San Jose. April 14, — Rev. E. A.
Winning, city clerk of Los Gatos, was
arrested by Marshal Shore last night as
he was taking home the ballots cast in
the municipal election Monday. Candi
dates Doolen and Derrickson, the former
"wet," and the latter "dry," are tied
for the third and decidinp place on "the
board of trustees, and a recount is to be

leave them in the town hall. The bal
lots were left in a bank vault, ard Win

Evelyn Ncsbit Thaw
Will Go to Paris
A friend of Mrs Evelyn Nesblt Thaw,
wife of Harry K. Thaw, authorized the
announcement that Mrs Thaw had given
uo her apartment, and that she would
depart for Paris to study sculpture.
Mrs Thaw has informed her friends that
she is taking this step at the advice of
competent teachers, who encourage her
to believe that her talent for such work
may be advantageously developed.
"I am through with Harry Thaw for
all time," Airs Thaw said to a friend.
"I am going to Paris to make my future
home. ' '
Mrs Mary C. Thaw still makes her
son's wife a monthly allowance, and it
is said Mrs Evelyn Thaw has informed
her friends that she will take a modest
apartment in the outskirts of Paris,
while she is studying sculpture.
