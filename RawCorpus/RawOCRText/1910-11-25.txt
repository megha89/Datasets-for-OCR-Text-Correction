Little Girl Improving
Mrs G. M. Huberty is" in San Fran
cisco with her daughter Veryl. The
latter has been suffering from an
attack of infantile paralysis, and the
trip to the city was for the purpose of
further treatment at the hands of
specialists who have charge of the
case. The child is slowly improving,
and hopes are held out of her complete
recovery.
New Manager Arrives.
J. A. Allison, who installed the new
pool and billiard parlor in . this city,
and later went to Napa to take charge
of another similar business, returned
on Tuesday evening with his wife, -and
will manage the local business. ■<■ - ■
D. Jenkins, who has had charge of
the business here and who is a partner
with Allison, left this city on Thurs
day morning for Napa to take charge
of the parlors in that city.. The ex
change of management will only be a
temporary one, as Mr Jenkins expects
to return to Jackson later on.
Visits Sick Brother
Mrs J. Quirolo left for San Fran
cisco this week, called there by the
illness of her brother, Fred Briggs,
who was seized with a stroke of para
lysis about two weeks ago. He was a
linotpye operator on the Enquirer of
Oakland, and has worked in that capa
city on that paper for more than
twenty years. At last reports he was
considerably improved. He was a
part owner in the Amador Ledger
thirty-five years ago.
Taxes Due Monday
Next Monday is the last day for .the
payment of the first instalment of
state and county taxes, which become
delinquent after 6 o'clock of that day.
Fifteen per cent will be added to the
amount if allowed to go delinquent.
It is creditable to Jackson, and in
dicates a healthy condition financially
among the property holders, that not a
solitary piece of property went delin
quent on account of municipal taxes
this year. Every property holder
settled with the city collector on time.
Visits Old Home
J. Noce, an old time resident of
Amador county, but now ot Colorado,
is here on a visit to his sister, Mrs P.
Ferrari of near Butte mountain, and
other relatives in this section. Mr
Noce is a printer, and worked on the
Ledger in the days when this paper
was owned by Thomas Springer, forty
years ago. Of course he sees a won
derful change in Jackson since be left,
he would scarcely recognize it as the
same place. Mr Noce is still employed
in the printing business, being at pre
sent a proof reader in one of the large
job offices in Denver. He expects to
return there in the course of a week
or so.
TRAGEDY IN
PINE GROVE
Two Citizens Danger
ously Wounded—As
sailant Killed
The village of Pine Grove was the
scene of a tragedy last Saturday
afternoon that has not been known in
that burg since early days. The chief
actor in the affray was an unknown
trump. Where he came from, and
wither bound no one seems .to know.
He was seen in Jackson the previous
night, and appeared rational enough.
It is said he appeared at one of the
stores, and bought a supply of car
tridges for his pistol, and was met the
following morning, Saturday, between
Jackson and Pine Grove. On, his way
to the Grove however, his actions
aroused suspicion that he^vas off men
tally. About 1.30 Saturday he entered
0. L. Webster's saloon in the Grove.
There were three men in the barroom
at the time— Clarence Berry, bar :
tender, S. Henson and J. B Detrick.
The stranger uttered not a word. He
walked toward the bar, and Berry,
thinking he was about to call for
something, stepped behind the bar
prepared to serve him. Alter reach
ing half across the. room, he turned
and retraced his steps to the main
door. He glanced both ways on the
road, apparently to see if any one was
near. Then turning toward the bar,
he whipped out his pistol and started
shooting, first at Berry behind the bar.
After shooting once at Berry without
effect, he turned on the others, firing
twice at Detrick, one bullet plough
ing a flesh wound in the hip, and the
other stiking him in back, penetrating
the cavity, and producing a dangerous
wound. He next shot at Henson, . the
bullet passing through portion of his
clothing, but leaving him untouched.
He felt the motion of the air as the
ball whistled close to his head.
While this was in progress the un
wounded men were trying - to escape
from the maniac— for such his actions
proved him to be— and finally went out
of the rear door, and ran in the direc
tion of James Lowry's saloon, the
crazy man following them.'
Lowry, who is 82 years of age, was
outside his place of business, piling up
wood. The shooter on seeing Lowry
uttered a sentence, "Here's another
— — - — " — the only words uttered by
him during the affair. . His pistol was
evidently exhausted by this time, so
he drew an old butcher knite, and
with this stabbed Lowry three times
in the breast. The knife was blunt,
and inflicted only flesh wounds. He
then seized a stick of wood from the
pile Lowry was engaged in stacking,
and struck him over the head, beating
him into insensibility. With this his
craving for blood seemed appeased,
and he started across a vacant lot
making his way to the main road by
which he had entered the village, scal
ing a high gate in order to get into the
highway. He was walking down the
road toward Jackson, and has reached
perhaps a hundred yards from Web
ster's saloon. By this time Berry had
secured a rifle and shot at the retreat
ing man. The ball struck him in the
back, and he instantly fell in the road.
He was in the act of turning, wnen
Berry fired again, the ball striking
him in the head, near the eye, killing
him instantly. He fell face downward
in the roadway, clutching his revolver.
Upon examination it was found that
the revolver of the stranger contained
four unused cartridges. He had evi
dently reloaded the weapon after leav
ing Webster's saloon.
The pistol was a new 32 caliber re
volver. An old knife, also four papers
—"Appeal to Reason"— a socialist
paper published in Kansas, also a Los
Angeles paper containing one of Stitts
Wilson's campaign speeches when
making his canvass for governor, to
gether with about 30 clippings from
the San Francisco Examiner, in which
Johnson was criticised; all papers
were issued either in October or No
vember of this year.
Lowry was earned from the road
tenderly by his friends into his home,
and Berry called up sheriff Gregory by
phone telling him of the killing. The
sheriff inquired, "Where is the man
you killed?" Berry replied, "He is
lying out here in the road."
Sheriff Gregory and district attorney
Vicini hastened to the scene of the
shooting. After learning the details,
they decided not to make any arrest,
deeming that the shooting of the
stranger was justifiable under the cir
cumstances.
Dr. Endicott was summoned to
render professional services to the in
jured men. Lowry was found In a
critical condition; his skull was
fractured, and he remained unconscious
until Monday, when he seemed to re
cover his faculties. Detrick was also
in a bad way. The bullet had lodged
in the lower part of his body. It was
thought at first that the chances of re
covery were against both the wounded
men, but it is now thought they may
pull through.
Coroner Potter heli an inquest over
the remains of the stranger on Sunday
morning, and the jury, after hearing
the testimony, exonerated Berry from
all blame, holding that the killing was
warranted. ,
Hugh Luttrell took a kodak photo
of the dead man before he was buried,
the burial being held at Pine Grove
Sunday afternoon.
j The man has not been identified.
One man thought he worked on the
ditch for the Standard Electric Com
pany several years ago, He was a
middle aired man. nrobablv het.wep.n 40
and 50 years old, of medium height,
and of sandy complexion. Dietrick
was removed to the county hospital
Sunday afternoon, for the purpose of
performing an operation to locate and
remove the bullet.
Several parties at the Grove recog
nized the slam man as Will Haves,
who worked for a time on the ditch of
the Standard Electric company in that
neighborhood last spring. The rope
around his blankets, also the butcher
knife were recognized as having been
in the possession of Haves. At first,
when he lay in the roadway, his
features were recognized, but after
wards when washed those who had
known Have were not so positive as
regards identification. Haves, when
working in that vicinity, was con
sidered peculiar. He was reserved,
did not engage in conversation, did not
drink, and was not in the least quarrel
some. He usually went to the saloon
in the evening after work, would take
a paper, and sit down in a corner by
himself if possible and read. He was
not addicted to gambling. No one
can think of anything having occurred
during his short stay in the Grove that
would cause him to have ' a grudge
against the town or any of those
whom he; so savagely attacked."
Nuptial Bells
Ring at Berkeley.
Nuptial bells rang merrily last Sun
day noon, when Archie S. Moore and
his h'nancee, Miss Edith D. Baker, the
beautiful and accomplished daughter
of Mr and Mrs Christopher Baker, were
united in marriage at the home of the
bride, 1809 Ninth street, West Ber
keley.
The wedding march was played by
a string orchestra, the bride and
groom hied into the parlor, which was
elaborately decorated in garlands of
roses. During the ceremony, Men
delshon's Spring song was rendered in
an undertone, creating a most en
chanting effect upon all present.
A sumptuous feast was spread after
the ceremony. The wedding cake
was a marvel of beauty.
Moore is musical director of Jack
son's Military band, and the wedding
is the culmination of a fascinating love
romance started several years ago in
Missouri.
Mr and Mrs Moore returned to Jack
son on Wednesday evening. A cozy
little home had been all prepared by
the groom at No. 30 Stacel Aye.,
where they expect to be permanently
located.

MURDER IN
DRYTOWN
Fracas Proves Fatal to
Young A/lan^-- Three
Arrests Made
A dance given at the home of Mit
chael Cavallero, who conducts a board
ing house in Drytown, Saturday night
last, ended in a fracas which proved
fatal to Stephen Fistore, aged 25
years.
The crowd assembled early in the
evening, and many of the party over
indulged in wine. Three of the crowd
were Italians who but recently arrived
in this county from Italy. The names
given by the trio are, Stefano Sampo,
George Sampo a brother, and Stefano
Conti These three young men, it
is reported, started the disturb
ance by passing insulting remarks
about Fistore and his lady friend
Mrs Cavallero remonstrated at their
conduct, and one of the three picked
up a chair and struck at the proprie
tor's wife. In so doing he smashed
the electric light globe, leaving the
room in Utter darkness.
Fistore made his way from the
place, and was hurrying down the
street when he was overtaken by the
trio, who, it is claimed, seized him,
and while two men held the victim,
the third beat his skull with a rock,
badly fracturing it.
After they had beaten the man in
sensible, they took him back to Caval
lero's place of business, and put him
in bed.
The victim was employed at a near
by mine, and was on the morning
shift. Early on Sunday morning Mrs
Cavallero knockedat Fistore's bedroom
to call him to prepare for work. He
failed to respond to her callings, and
when she examined him, she found
life extinct, he having expired some
time during the night.
Deputy constable Dan Bona, was im
mediately notified, and hurrying to the
place Jfound the victim's body still
warm, indicating that the -man had
been dead but a short time.
The official, after learning the iden
tity of the assailants, engaged a team
and drove over to New Chicago, where
he found his men in a saloon.
He immediately placed them under ar
rest, and drove to Jackson, where
they were lodged in jail. The priso
ners were not aware of the predica
ment in which they had placed them
selves by their brawl, as it never oc
curred to them that they were to face
a murder charge. What they really
did think was. that their victim had
preferred a charge of battery against
them, and that a small fine would
settle the matter and grant them their
freedom.
So without a murmur, they sub
mitted to arrest, and were brought to
the county seat, a distance of about
seven miles, without handcuffs or
shackles, the three prisoners riding' in
the rear seat of the surrey, while the
constable and driver rode in the front
seat.
After they were lodged safely in
jail, they were acquainted with the
real facts of the case, which brought
forth a sullen disposition, instead of
the indifferent expression carried up
to this time.
Coroner Potter summoned a jury on
Monday afternoon, arid held an in
quest over the remains. The jury re
ported that death was due to injuries
supposed to have been inflicted upon
the deceased the previous night in a
quarrel with John Sampo and Stefano
Conti, and holds both men responsible
for the death of Fistori.
The law firm of Spagnoli & Spangoli
are attorneys for the defendants. The
preliminary hearing has been set for
this afternoon, and will be heard be
fore justice Blower in Plymouth.
Here on Vacation.
Dr. C. C. Golding, veterinary sur
geon, who left Jackson last September
for San Francisco, returned to this
city last Sunday for about a 10 days 1
vacation.
Golding is taking a special course in
the hospital of the San Francisco
veterinary college, 1818 Market street,
San Francisco, principally studying
the uses of new serums for infectious
diseases. He intends returning to the
city and complete his course of study
this year, and expects to return to
Jackson some time next March, when
he will open up a permanent office and
locate here.

MINE NEWS
ALONG LODE
Interesting Accounts of
Mines Located In
Amador Co.
Hardenburg
Things are moving apace around
this mine. Supplies are being rushed
to the ground with all possible speed.
Every day a big team goes through
loaded with suppilcs. Every effort is
being put forth to have all necessary
material on hand before the heavy
rain sets in, so that the work can pro
ceed right along. The road to the
shaft has been completed, and the
work of sinking is being prosecuted,
At the close of last week the new
shaft had reached a .'epth of ten feet,
working three shif tf f eight hours a
day. There are twe r y-five men em
ployed. To sink a large working shaft
to the depth of fifteen hundred feet is
expected to take from fifteen to eigh
teen months to complete. The com
pany, it is said, will sink that deep
before doing any prospect work.
Argonaut
A new building has been erected at
the Argonaut mine, which will house a
merry-go-round, or buddle, as soon as
the necessary supplies for the machi
nery can be obtained. The new buddle
is a set of revolving wheels upon
which the line slime is run, and the
sulphurets collected. It works auto
matically, flushing itself. The present
slime plant is manipulated by a crew
of men, and this is an expense which
will be done away with when the
merry-go-round begins operation.
Nearly all the larger mines have the
buddle in operation, and it has given
satisfaction at the Zeila, Bunker Hill
and Fremont. The Argonaut output
of ore holds its value in most en
couraging manner. The mine is a big
factor in the city's welfare, as its
monthly pay roll means considerable
to the merchants.
Kennedy
The large drum which carries the
wire cable, used in hoisting and
lowering the skip at the Kennedy
mine, broke on Saturday about noon,
and put the shaft practically out of
operation for several days. Several
shifts of men have gone to work,
however, using the north shaft as
means of egress and exit. They are
lowered in this shaft to the 2400 level
and then travel through a drift over
into the workings of the new mine.
From this level they are compelled to
travel down the stopes several hun
dred feet by ladders, to the stations
in which they are detailed.
The mill lost no time, as a five days'
supply of ore is always carried on
hand, and this was sufficient to tide
the operations of the mill over the
shaft tie up.
Lincoln Consolidated
A slight setback was encountered at
this Sutter Creek property last week.
The electric motor broke down, prac
tically bringine the operations in the
shaft to a standstill. It took over a
week to get the machinery in running
order again. . Otherwise things are
moving along quite satisfactorily.
Looking for Location
J. S. Davis has been in Jackson
several times since the election look
ing for a suitable place of residence.
The sheriff elect has been offered
several places and will no doubt be
able to secure a site embodying all the
essential features of nearness to court
house, barn accommodations, and
other desirable points. He expects to
move to Jackson before January.
Broadway Home Quarantined
The young child of Mr and Mrs
Lester Flagg, who reside at Electra,
was stricken with diptheria while on a
visit to her grandmother, Mrs Deletis
who resides on Broadway, at the north
entrance of the bridge, this city.
County health officer, Dr. K. E. En

It was tacked up on Monday morning.

FRIDAY NOVEMBERS, 1910
AMENDING OUR CRIMINAL LAWS.
It is notorious that the system of criminal procedure in
this country is the most cumbersome, expensive, and at the
same time ineffective, among civilized nations. The case of
Dr Crippen in London has brought into strong relief the de
fects of our methods of dealing with criminals. Here was a
man tried, convicted and executed for a capital crime in the
short space of two or three mouths — less time than it fre
quently takes to get a notable murder case fairly before a
jury in this country. Outside of the United States the ma
chinery of law for the punishment of crime moves swifty on-:
ward to its goal — the punishment or acquittal of the accused.
It makes little difference whether the defendant be possessed
of wealth to fee high-priced lawyers or not — the progress of
the case through the courts is little affected thereby. With
all our vaunted claims to material progress, it must be ad
mitted that in dealing with crime and criminals we might
pattern with advantage after the ways of the older countries
in many respects.
In. view of our admittedly defective system, the state legis
lature that will assemble in Sacramento next January is
pledged to reform. One of the vital changes proposed is to
allow the trial judge to instruct the jury as to the facts as
developed by the testimony as well as the law bearing upon
the case. This has loug been the practice in European
countries. It has been found to work so satisfactorily that'
no idea of change would be favored. The summing up of the
judge is usually the crucial point of the trial; the evidence
is sifted by a trained and impartial mind, and the jury is told
what to believe and what to discard. The charge amounts to
a recommendation ou the part of the judge whether a verdict
of guilt or innocence should be returned. It is rare indeed
that a verdict is found contrary tto the judge's recommenda
tion, and still rarer that a failure to reach a verdict occurs,
which is so often the outcome of criminal trials in this coun
try. How it came to pass that in our courts the trial judge
iv his instructions to the jury became limited to questions of
law only, and any expression of his views concerning the
facts would be deemed prejudicial error, and sufficient ground
for a new trial, we do not know. Experience has demon
strated that this departure has not been conducive to the "sup
pression of crime or the punishment of wrong-doers.
But another reform proposed is permitting three-fourths
of the jury to bring in a verdict in criminal as well as civil
cases. Whether this is necessary, with the enlarged powers
given to the judge in instructing the jury may be doubted.
Anyway, there is reason to believe that some of the ..crying
evils of our criminals trials will ere long be remedied, so that
the main object to be attained in the prosecution of crime —
the protection of society — will be kept more in the fore
ground than under the present system.
The complete returns of the vote on $18,000,000 bonding
proposition for state highways have not been made public as
yet. It is probable that the proposition has carried. If so,
we are inclined to think the people have voted themselves a
big white elephant. We have little faith in the state engag
ing in the construction and maintenance of roads. And to
embark in this business by piling up a huge debt seems
folly indeed. It is not probable that Amador county will
share in the roadniaking under this bond issue. We will be
lucky if counted outside of the field of operations of the model
roads to te built by this fund, because the condition at
tached to the expenditure thereof is that each county is
required to meet the aunual interest payment on the bonds
for such proportion of the money as is expended within the
county. At an estimated cost of $10,000 per mile, the bur
den is not inviting to counties situated like^ Amador. But
we shall have to pay our share of the fund for the redemp
tion of the bonds. This will strike us in the shape of a
special state tax levied annually for that purpose.
The democrats will have a majority of over sixty in the
house of representatives in the next congress. Thanks to
the insurgent brand of republicanism that works in the in
terest of the democratic party.

induction coil 54 times at each turn,
each interruption causing the second
ary of the coil to flash across a pair
of spark-gaps arranged at a short
distance in front. A series of quartz
and Iceland spar lenses transmits the
light ra>s to the aperture on ground
glass of the film case. Special devices
are necessary to bring a flying insect
within the field of view and in one
form the insect moves a light mica
door in escaping from a glass tube,
thus making contact starting the
shutter mechanism as flight is begun
toward the nearest window. The pic
tures made being shown by the ordi
nary cinematograph at the rate of 15
or less per second, instead of 1,500 or
2,000, the rapid motions photographed
are easily seen.
The number of plant- species now
known is estimated by Prof. Chas Bes
sey at 210,000. He points out that
about 18 years ago Saccardo found the
number known to be 174,000, and con
cluded that it would reach 400,000— in
eluding 250,000 fungi— in 150 years, by
which time botanists might be, ex
pected to find all species in existence.
Linnie, 150 years before Saccardo,
knew. 8,551 species. -"/ '"": L . \? ".'i>'. :^f; -"
The new Austrian chainless bicycle
is claimed to save 50 ,per cent in
power. The riner moves his feet up
and down, instead of in a circle, thus
working two long levers which alter
nately pull a chain passing to the
rear over pulleys to two sprocket
wheels, which in turn act upon a free
wheel ratchet to drive the hub of the
rear .wheel.
The power-storage plan of Prof. R.
A. Fessenden, first made known at the
last meeting of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, de
pends upon the use of intermittent
cheap power for pumping water from
tanks sunk 1,000 feet or so into the
earth, and keeping the water in sur
face tanks until needed. The power
thus stored would be made available at
any time by causing the water to drive
turbines on its way back to the lower
level. The water could be pumped in
the usual way by windmills, or by sun
engines, or, better, by both. Solar
heat is to be utilized by means of a
large tank containing a shallow layer
of water and having a steam-tight
covering of wired glass. It is m stated
that the heat can be made to boil the
water, generating steam enough to
run a low pressure turbine, and it is
calculated that a "sun-tank" 650 feet
square would develop more than 1,000
horse-power for 7 hours a day through
out the year. It seems evident, how
ever, that such a result could be had
only in a favorable climate. Compar
ing the expense ot different sources
of energy, Prof. Fessenden has esti
mated that power from water stored
by the sun and wind pumps would be
about one-fifth of that of steam, one
fourth of that of gas, six-fifths of that
of Niagara Falls, and somewhat less
than twi'-e that of the cheapest water
powers.
The rescue apparatus evolved from
experiments in British mines is claimed
to make it practicable and easy for
its wearer to work 5 or 6 hours in
the most noxious gases. No helmet
is used, but a headpiece holds the
mouthpiece in place, a light clamp
closes the nostrils, and the eyes are
protected by goggles. A bag sus
pended from the shoulders in front
carries the air supply. A pipe leads
the air exhaled to a receptacle filled
with chemicals to absorb the carbonic
acid and replenish the oxygen, and
from this the restored air passes again
to the breathing bag. The weight is
23 pounds.
The height of a meteor observed in
Asia on Aug. 11, 1909, has been ac
curately determined from knots and
outbursts shown on photographs taken
at three different stations. It first ap
peared, very faint, at about 70 miles,
brightened suddenly at 60 miles,
showed marked outbursts at 55 nnd 68
miles, suddenly grew fainter at hVA
miles, brightened at 50^ miles, and
disappeared nt 50 miles.
New possibilities in medicine have
Been discovered by Dr. Franz, Nagel •
schmidt in the heating effects of elec
tric currents. In a demonstration be
fore the London Koyal Society of
Medicine, he used an alternating cur
rent of as much as 1% amperes at 800
volts— instead of the very small cur
rent at 100,000 volts tried by D'Arson
val a quarter of a century ago— and
with this he showed heating and cook
ing action confined entirely to the nar
row path of the current. With the
two poles placed on opposite sides of a
piece of liver, the current coagulated
the portion correspondng to tho diame
ter of the electrodes, all except that in
the direct course traversed being un
affected. In a solution of white ,of
egg in a glass trough, the hardening
could be watched, and with a current
of o.samperes it was seen to commence
midway between the electrodes nnd
progress toward them. The practical
value of this action is expected to be
great. Diseased tissue— like cancer
can be destroyed without loss of blood,
localized pains can be relieved prompt
ly by moderate heating, and many
other results can be achieved, Includ
ing that of strengthening and acceler
ating the heart's action.
A Roman mirror found in an ancient
burial ground in Austria, and believed
to date from the 2d or 3d century A.
I)., is a slightly convex glass plate
fitted into an indented leaden . ring
about a sixth of an inch in thickness
and 3 inches in greatest diameter.
From chemical and microscopical in
vestigation, two German 'chemists
have concluded that the mirror was
made by attaching lead foil to the thin
glass by some balsam that has changed
to resin and combined with the lead to
form a resinate. Much of the lead of
the frame had been converted into red
oxide or basic carbonate.
The plans for electrifying 700 miles
of the western coast of Mexico include
three large hydro-electric plants of a
combined capacity of 300,u00 horse
power and 1,200 miles of transmission
line. Dams across the Mayo, Humaya
and Santiago rivers will form storage
reservoirs aggregating 30 billion gal
lons in capacity. The largest of the
three dams— that across the Humaya—
will be 223 feet high and 708 feet long.
BOOSTER'S CLUB
IS DISBANDED
Money In Treasury Is
Given to Ladies Im
provement Club
A notice in last week's papers call
ing a mass meeting of citizens of this
city to be held in the superior court
room on Monday evening, drew a con
siderable a f tendance of ladies, but less
than half a dozen men folks. Jas. Jay
Wright called the meeting "to order,
and R. I. Kerr was elected chairman.
After informing those present that the
object of the gathering was to learn
what means were advisable in dispos
ing of the money in the treasury of
the high school boosters' club. Mrs
Endicott said that the club had raised
$186 through various agencies, and that
there was a balance left in the trea
sury of $118.10. This sum she thought
should be turned over to the ladies' im
provement club for promoting a cam
paign to further the location of the
county high school in Jackson.
After a short discussion, a vote was
taken, and the money was turned
over to the ladies' improvement club.
A motion was then carried to disband
the boosters' club.
A new meeting was then organized,
with the same chairman. It was sug
gested by Rev. J. O. Duncan that a
committee of seven be appointed to
go among the citizens and enlist every
man and woman in the high school
cause by having them enroll as mem
bers of a permanent high school club,
to be organizec next Monday, at a
meeting to be held in the court room
for that purpose. Those appointed on
this committee were, Fred Eudey. R.
I. Kerr, Jas. Jay Wright, G. Brown.
Chris Marelia, Wm. Penry jr., and C.
Giovannoni. After a short discussion
of the duties of this committtee, the
meeting adjourned until next Monday.
What L-R's Mean
The Lincoln-Roosevelt organization
was known in its abbreviated form as
the L-R's. After Lissner and Rovvell
got in control the L-R's meant Lissner-
Rowell. After they succeeded in
electing Johnson, L-R's stood for
Lucky-Rascals Now that they are
trying to make their followers belie "c
that Works under the advisory \o'. \

Lying-Reprobates. After these a- •
tie men have run the party for a ye <-•
or two it will mean Late-Reformers. --

New Postal Regulation.
The post office department has made
a rule that letters bearing the name
and address of the sender on the en
velope shall be returned to the writer
after five days, if the person addressed
cannot be found. The only exception
is in offices of the fourth class, in
which letters will be held fifteen days.
Under the old ruling a letter had to
be held thirty days.
The new ruling will prevent the ac
cumulation of mail matter at post
offices, and will also show the people
the value of having a return note] on
the mail. The address of the sender
on a card or envelope helps .tho postal
department, and also insures prompt
return in case of non-delivery. The
writer's name and address should be
on every letter. In five days the letter
will be returned if not delivered or
called for.

When Children Smoked.
JoreTln tie Itochefort, who published
In Paris in IC7I au nccouut of his trav
els Id England, tells the followlug:
"Wblle we were walking about the
town (Worcester) lie asked me if it
was the custom in France as lv Eng
land that when the children went to
school they carried in their satchel
with their books a pipe of tobacco,
which their mothers took care to fill
early iv the morniug, it serving them
Instead of breakfast, and that at the
accustomed hour every one laid aside
bis book to light his pipe, the master
smoking with them and teaching them
how to hold their pipes and draw In
the tobacco."
In England at the time of the great
plague It was reported that no one liv
ing In a tobacconist's bouse fell sick of
the disease. This caused a great de
mand for tobacco. Hearne says In his
diary, "I remember that I heard for
merly Tom Rogers, who was yeoman
beadle, say that when be was a school
boy at Eton that year when the plague
raged all the boys of that school were
obliged to smoke every morning and
that be was never whipped so much In
bis life as he was one morning for not
smoking."
In th« Nick of Time.
The steamer was on the point of
leaving, and the passengers lounged
on the deck and waited for: the start
At length one of thenr espied -a <«b
In the fur distance, and It soon be
enme evident that the driver was do
ing bin level best to catch the boat.
Already the sailors' bands were on
the gangways, and tbe cab's chances
looked small Indeed. Then a sportive
passenger wagered a sovereign to a
shilling that be would miss It. Tbe
offer was taken, and at once tbe deck
became a scene of wild excitement.
"He'll miss It!"
"No; he'll just do it!" S
"Come on!"
"He won't do It!"
"Yeti, he will. Ile'a done itt Hur
rah!'
In the very nick of time toe cab ar
rived, its occupant sprang out and ran
up the one gangway left.
"Cast off!" be cried.

The Fun of the Farce.
It is related that the manager of a
theater consented to hear in bis room
n young man who had an unfortunate
impediment lv his speech read -a short
farce, tlic sole condition being that it
should not occupy more time than it
took to iinish the cigar the manager
bad just lit. They both started, the
one reac!lng L the other smoking, but as
tho iuild Havana gradually grew
•shorter tbe worse the young author
spluttered. They finished together. Of
course tbe question v.-as immediately
put, "What do you think of It?-"
"Well," replied the manager, "It's not
a half bad Idea. Father, mother, lover,
daughter, all stuttering, will be novel!"
Tbe author, furious, exclaimed: "They
don't stammer! It 13 only my misfor
tune."
"Oh, then, the play isn't funny at
all! Sorry that I can't accept it," re
turned the manager.

aged, 54 years, 6 months and 16

Dock Harris Burris was born in Vol
cano, Amador county, April. 27, 1856,.
and shortly after his family returned
to lone Valley, their former home,
and here Mr Burris had resided,
practically, all his life. He chose the
occupation of a farmer for his life
work, and as such he made a suc-
cess, as the fine farm in Jackson
Valley proves. < He was married at
Buena Vista, in early life, to i Rosie
Mullen, and five children, three girls
and two boys, came to bless their
union. . Some time ago Mr Burris dis-
covered there was something troubling
his side, and he consulted physicians
with only temporary relief, until in
early summer it was decided that an
operation was necessary, so he leased
his farm and removed to Sacramento.
Here a surgical examination revealed
the fact that he had a tumorous
growth on the spleen, and the sur-
geons decided that to remove it would
cause instant death. The remains of
Mr Burris were brought from Sacra-
mento Sunday afternoon, accompanied
by family and friends, and the inter
ment took place in lone cemetery, the
beautiful burial services of the I,

Why Hindoos Don't Go Mad.
Why nre there so few lunatic any*
liiri's Mi:d so small a proportion of In
sane porsvma In Iml In? That Is a ques
tion which many a traveler has won
derlnfcly asked. The Hindoos regulate
their lives entirely In accordance with
their religion— that Is, their working,
eating, sleeping, as well as what wo
usually regard ns our "life" In the re
ligious sense of the word. Everything
Is arranged for them, nnd they follow
the rules now Just ns they did 2,000
years ago. This constant observance
of tho same rules for twenty centuries
has molded tho brains of the race Into
one shape, as It were, and, although
their rites are queer enough, yet there
Is but nu occasional example of that
striking deviation from the common
which 18 called Insanity In countries
Inhabited by the white nice. They are
CUollsta too. With them It Is a case
of "what la to be will be" carried to
the CStrotne. THs has In time given
thoui tho \m\\v.c to take all things
enlnilj and ro freed them from the
inxlctj that drives so many white
ni3U into tho lunatic asylums.
Tlicuuh* It Was the Monkey's.
A <llamo:i<.t necklace was possessed
by Mifle. Geoffrey <ie St. Hllare, the
wife of the fa.'ious French naturalist.
It was one of thi chlefest of her "con
tentnuntr," as Hindoo women aptly
term their Jewels. One day inadauie
missed her necklace. There was a ter
rible turmoil Iv tho h\use, and all the
Ecrvanf-3 rtowu to the foolish fat scul
'.loa vrcru suspected, but In turn proved
their iutiocence. At last It was remem
bered tUat M. de St. Hilalio had a pet
moukcy, uud on v search belug made
In the "glory hole" of the qua-lrumane
the precious bauble was discovered hid
den away with a white satin shoe, sev
eral cigar ends, a pencil case aud a de
composed apple. The renowned nat
uralist calmly observed' that lie Lad
frequently seen the monkey playing
with the necklace. "Why did you not
take it from him?" indignantly asked
his spouse. "I thought it belonged to
him," replied M. de St. Hilaire. He ev
idently thought there was nothing un
natural In an ape possessing a diamond
necklace as his personal property.
The Monasteries of Tibet.
Every Tibetan family is compelled
to devote its firstborn male child to a
monastic life. Soon after his birth
the child is taken to a Buddhist mon
astery to be brought up and trained in
priestly mysteries. At about the age
of «ight he jolus one of the caravans
which travel Jo Lassa. There he is at
tached to one' of the local monasteries,
where he remains as a novice until he
is fifteen, ' learning to read the sacred
books and perform the religious rites
of his faith. The firstborn son, being
thus sent Into the church, as we
should say ia this country, the second
becomes the head of the family
aud marries. Unlike some other seinl
civillzed races, these young Tibetans
have the right of choosing their own
wives. Nor can a Tibetan girl be
married off by her parents -without her
own consent. The curious custom iv
regard to the eldest sods results of
course, iv nearly every Tibetan family
acquiring the odor of sanctity, num
bering a monk among its members-

Slow but Inexorable Justice.
In October," 1000, Pietro Glaconl and
Marie Bonelli were tried at Rome on
a charge of sextuple murder by poi
soning committed thirty-one years be
fore. Iv England Eugene Aram was
banged for the murder of Clarke four
teen years after the offense. A man
named Home was executed for the
murder of his child in the eighteenth
century no less than thirty-five years?
after the offense. There is also the
well known case of Governor Wall,
who was executed in 1802 for a mur
der committed In 1782. Sherward was
hanged at Norwich for the murder of
his wife after a lapse of twenty years.
But Sir Fltzjames Stephens recalls
what Is the most remarkable case of
all. He prosecuted as counsel for the
crown in 1803 a man who was charged
with stealing a leaf from a parish reg

1803. In this case the prisoner was
acquitted.— London Standard.

While Uustave Dore was at Ischi
and wandering about the mountains
he became much Interested in n conn
try wedding and sketched It on the
spot. He put tho sketch into n book
fn the pocket of his paletot nnd went
back to the hotel to dinner. After
dinner he looked for the sketch. It
was gone. Angry nt the theft, the
artist called the landlord and made
complaint, but no trace of the book
wns found. From Ischi Dore went to
Vienna, and there he found n letter
and a parcel awaiting him. The let
ter, which wns anonymous, read thus:
"Sir, 1 stole your book nt Ischi. The
sketch was so charming that I could
not resist the temptation of having il
in my possession, nud I knew -very
well you would never consent to Bell
it to me. But theft .is neither my
trade nor my habit, anil I beg you to
accept ns a souvenir of my crime and
my enthusiasm for your talent the
walking stick which #111 reach you at
the same time as this letter."
The cane was one with n massive
gold head in which was set a gem of

The Clock's Annoying Habit.
Mrs. Benham had Just seated herself
to work at a bit of embroidery that re
quired particular care and attention
when there came a ring nt the tele
phone. "I just know that's Mrs. Gum
my," she said as she laid down her
work and went to answer the call.
"Whenever I am unusually busy and
haven't any time to spare she rings
me up nnd talks to me by the hour."
She was right. It was Mrs. Gum
my, who was fully as talkative as
ever. She began with a long story,
and when fairly In the middle of it
the clock on the wall of the room be
gan, tejtrike.
"Wait a liiomeut," interposed Mrs.
Benham. "I can't hear you until this
noise stops."
"What made that noise V" asked Mrs.
Gummy after it had ceased.
"It was only the clock,' answered
the patient Mrs. Beuham. "You know
It always strikes once or twice when
we get to talking."
The conversation did not last long
after that.— Youth's Companion.
A Curious Trap.
A curious labyrinth in which ele
phants are captured alive is to be seen
near Ayuthla, formerly the capital of
Slam. The labyrinth is formed of a
double row of Immense tree trunks
set firmly iv the ground, the space be
tween them gradually narrowing.
Where It begins, at the edge of the
forest, the opening of tho labyrinth is
more than a mile wide, but as it ap
proaches Ayuthia it becomes so nav
now that the elephants cannot turn
around. Suspecting no danger, the
wild elephant enters the broad open
ing at the forest end, lured on by a
tame elephant. The gradual narrow-
Ing of the boundaries is not observed
until the elephant fiuds himself in
close quarters. Having reached the
end of the labyrinth, the tame elephant
is allowed to pass through a gate,
while men lying in wait slip shackles
over the feet of the captives. The
sport is a dangerous one. for the en
raged elephants sometimes crush the
hunters under their feet.
Bull Baiting.
Although bull baiting was a cruel
pastime, it was also a fulfilling of the
law, for formerly no butcher was al
lowed to offer for sale the flesh of any
bull that had not been baited. Tho
goading of the animal in a fury was
supposed to have some influence on the
flesh. In a similar belief the flesh of a
hunted hare was thought to be superior
in flavor to that of one that had been
shot, and a pceseut of "a hunted hare"
was considered to be a special compli
ment. In the records of the corpora
tion of Leicester, England, the follow
ing order appears: "At a common hall,
held on Thursday before St. Simon and
St. Jude, 1407, 'no butcher to kill a bull
till baited.' " At Winchester it was or
dered (reign of Henry VIII.) "that
from hensforth ther shal be no bul
stako set before any mayor's dore to
bayte any bull, but onlle at the bull
rlnge within the salde cytle."
Gender of the Sword.
Among the many curious notions ob
taining among the different races us
ing the sword may be noted the gen
der of- the weapon. In the north of
Europe it was either masculine, as in
Britain, or ueutei 1 , as iv Germany,
while in the south It was uniformly
feminine. Its force and cruelty ap
pealed to the northern mind. Its grace
and elegauce attracted the warriors
of the sunny south. It typified to the
one strength, to the other dignity.

"Good!" shouted tho friend of the

MANY SPECIAL FLAG'S
Uncle Sam Has Some Which Arc
Very Seldom Seen.
COLORS OF THE PRESIDENT.
Not Until 1882 Did tha Chief Execu
tive of the Nation Have a Personal
Banner, but Now He Haa Three, the
Naval, Army and Peace Flags.
As the United States grew nnd the
government expanded many uew de
partinentM were added, und with them
many S|iet'i(ll Hags have conic Into ex
istence. I-<'!ist often seen nnd yet
most Interesting of. these twenty-live
or thirty special flags Is that of the
president of the United States. lie
lias a wpirith of them — In fact, no less
than throe- -but they are seldom seen
In public. There aro two each of these
flags, one of bunting and one of silk.
They are exactly alike, with this ex
ception, but the one of silk Is called
the "president's colors."
The president of the United Statos
had no personal flag until ISS2. If he
went aboard a ship his presence was
denoted by the national flag hoisted
at the main truck, and his presence in
a garrison or post was denoted by the
raising of the big garrison flag. These
were uot entirely distinctive as denot
ing the presence of the president, for
these flags were hoisted on gala occa
sions when the president was not
around. The lack of a distinguishing
flag for him was felt by the navy also,
and the secretary of the navy by gen
eral orders, Aug. 19, 1882, established
a flag for the president of the United
States. The general orders described
the flag as of blue bunting with the
coat of arms of the United States in
the center. The flag was to be hoisted
at the main of the vessel when the
president was aboard and be carried at
the bow of the launch on which he
came aboard.
In the army there wns no distin
guishing flag for the president of the
United States until just before the
outbreak of the Spanish-American war.
Colonel Theodore Blngham. v.-bo was
then superintendent of public build
lugs and {^zounds, called the attention
of President McKlnley to this lack of
a distinguishing flag for him and
stated that he thought the commander
In chief of the United States army and
navy ought to have a distinguishing
flag. President McKlulcy did not like
the suggestion, but the secretary of
war did. and a flag was made. It was
designed by Frederick D. Owen and Is
a beautiful thing to look at. The offi
cial description of the flag is as fol
lows: T i
"The president's flag is of scarlet
bunting} 1 thirteen feet fly nnd eight feet
hoist. In each corner is n five pointed
star of five inch radius to the tips. In
the center of the scarlet field is a large
fifth star, also of five points, two feet
nine Inches in radius to the tips. In
side of this star Is n parallel star,
separated from it by a baud of white
three inches wide. The inner star
forms the blue Held upon which is the
coat of arms of the United States. Cfl
the scarlet field around the large star
are forty-six small white stars, one for
each state, equally scattered iv the re
entering angles and ail included with
in the circumference of an imaginary
circle three feet and a quarter In
radius. In the upper point over the
angle is a constellation of thirteen
stars, representing the original thirteen
states of tho American confederation."
Mr. Owen explained that in the olive
leaves, its berries and the arrows is
symbolized the original thirteen. It Is
also uot a little singular that the offi
cial seal should bear In its motto ex
actly thirteen letters nnd that the gen
eral order which created the flag was
also numbered thirteen. The magnifi
cent silken colors of the president's
flag are of scarlet, and the design is
embroidered upon this so exquisitely
that it is impossible to tell right from
wrong side when looking at the flag.
The colors on the flag are what Is
called "proper"— that is, natural— the
eagle being brown and the olive
branches green, with red berries. This
flag is to be displayed only in time of
war.
Yet another flag has the president.
In 1002 the "peace" flag was adopted.
This third flag differs in a good many
respects from the other two. Iv the
first place, the great seal of the United
States is correctly depicted. On the
other flags the design of the seal is
seven red stripes and six white ones,
which is correct, as the flag design
was adopted by the Third congress,
but when the great soal was adopted
the designer, uot knowing much about
the flag, us the forefathers lutended,
aud hlx red stripes. And that is the
seal today. There was a loug discus
sion whether the seal should uot be
changed to agree with the stripes oa
the flag, us the forefathers intended,
but It was decided that as it had
beeu adopted It should remain. This
"peuce" flag thus has the seal correctly
depleted. The eagle Is snow white,
its feathers being outlined Iv deep
black. There Is a different arrange
tneut of tho stars aud of the sunburnt
also. The sunburst is exactly circular
iv form, with the rays radiating from
the group of stars. The colors arc of
i.llk with exactly the same design.—
Washington Star.

ANCIENT LONDON.
When Danger and Lanthorns Were
Abroad After Dark.
Less than 200 years ago the watch
men of London town, carrying horn
lauthorns and halberds, dressed in long
coats and knee breeches, walked up
and down the cobbled streets of th'j
world's largest city chanting the fol
lowing verse:
A light there, maids! Hang out your light
And ai-o your horns be clear and bright.
That co your candle clear may shine,
Continuing: from six to nine,
That honest men that walk alone;
May see to pass safe without wrong.
It Is beyond our comprehension and
Imagination iv these days of flaming
iire lamps and brilliantly lighted
streets to picture the streets of Lon
don in the lawless age when only a
candle with a cotton wick was bung
out here and there on dark nights. It
was an age of lanthorns, of flambeaux
and linkboys, when every one made
his will and prepared for death when
he ventured out at night.
It is so written that it was a com
mon practice in that city for a com
pany of a hundred or more to make
nightly invasions upon houses of the
wealthy to kill and rob, and it is re
corded "that when night was come no
man durst venture to walk in the
streets."— Springfield Union.
A Rattlesnake Story.
In "Life and Sport on the Taciflc
Coast" Horace A. Vacbell relates one
of Ills narrow escapes from a friend's
bullet. "My cousin and I had been
camping and buntiug for several days
In ft sort of paradise valley. One day
during a long ride on horseback we
had seen a great many rattlesnakes
and killed a few, an exceptional ex
perience. That night my cousin woke
up and saw by the light of the moon
a big rattler crawling across my chest.
He lay for a moment fascinated, hor
ror struck, watching the sinuous curves
of the reptile. Then he quietly reach
ed for his six shooter, but he could not
see the reptile's head, and he' moved
nearer, noiselessly, yet quickly, dread-
Ing some "movement on my part that
should precipitate the very thing ho
dreaded, and then he saw that It was
not a snake at all— only the black and
yellow stripe of my blanket, which
gently rose and fell as I breatfied.
Had beared— well, It might have besn
bad for me. for he confessed that his
hand shook."
And They Didn't Exercise.
William M. Evarts.* who lived until
he wns nearly ninety, said he kept li!>
health by nt-ver taking exercise. Th?
celebrated Dr. William Geoyss Mead.
who lived to the surprising ago of 1 IS
years, spent nearly all. of his tlnio la
the open air and played a little golf.
Dr. Mead used to drink two or three
quarts of water every dny. and perhaps
there is n suggestion in that. Old Du
bols, who lived In Canada for the bet
ter part of 11!> years on the north
shore of Lake Erie, never worked ami
never took exercise. He spent seventy
five years of bis life fishing with llool;
and Hue and nto nothing but baked ap
ples and milk and brown bread and un
salted butter. Perhaps you can live
that long if you do nothing but fish
and eat what old Dubols did. But tako
notice that these long livers never ex
ercised.—New York Telegraph.

be restored to Its original state and
rendered equal to new If proper care
and attention ore bestowed upon It.
Very fine handmade laces should nev
er be cleansed by washing In the
ordinary way. If they nre only slight
ly soiled they could be very easily
cleaned by rubbing powdered chalk or
calcined mngnesla well into them.
This method of cleaning la credited to
the late Mme. Modjeska. The lace
should be ■ neatly spread out upon a
soft white clolh or One white paper
and thoroughly covered with the chalk
or magnesia; then thla should be cov
ered by another cloth or paper of a
similar nature, and the whole should
be laid away for a few days under a
heavy weight. At the expiration of
the allotted time tbe lace should bo
taken from Its wrappings and should
receive a gentle but thorough shaking.
Another method is to take a quart
or less of cornmaal. Put it Into a bowl
or pun; then dip rtntl squeeze uud
work the corntneul Into the mesh of
the lace without straining any of the
threads. After this treatment and a
good shaking it will look as fresh and
attractive as uew.
Very fine lace which has become
quite soiled may be cleaned by wash-
Ing It carefully In benzine. The lace
should be put Into a bowl and covered
with the bust und purest benzine that
can be procured und be allowed to
soak for a short time, occasionally re
ceiving a gentle shaking, but it should
never be rubbed with the hands. If
necessary, when the benzine Is poured
off It should be replaced by a fresh
supply and the lace allowed to soak
again for n time. After It has become
perfectly clean It should be pinned
while still quite wet on a flannel cov
ered board to dry. . It Is important
that this should be done with great
care. Plenty of small pins should be
used for the purpose. Each point, must
be fastened down securely with due
regard to the pattern of the lace so as
to keep It even and correct.
If the lace dries before the task has
been quite completed it should be
moistened again with a sponge wrung
out of benzine and then be exposed to
the sun. where the fresh air may play
upon It in order to dispel the disagree
able odor arising from the use of ben
zine.

Deafness Can not oe Cured
by local applications as#they cannot
reach the diseased portion of tho ear
There is only one way to euro deafness
and that Is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inllnmed con
dition of the mucous "liuing 1 of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is In
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can oe
taken out and this lube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are caused by_ Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars
or any case of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh") that cannot be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free.

The Doctor's First Question
"How are your bowels?" This is generally the first ques-
tion the doctor asks. He knows what a sluggish liver
means. He knows what a long list of distressing com-
plaints result from constipation. He knows that headaches,
bilious attacks, indigestion, impure blood, and general
debility are often promptly relieved by a good liver pill.
We wish you would talk with your own doctor about
this subject. Ask him at the same time if he approves
of Ayer's Pills. Do as he says. /. c. A w* Co. , Lowell, M^.

To Start Business
In Plymouth
Mrs Amber Meek has resigned her

of next month. The northern town is
believed to be on eve of a boom, with
the starting up of the Alpine mine,
and the prospect that the Plymouth
Consolidated is to be reopened at an
early date.

Church Bazaar
A Worthy Cause
The ladies guild of St. Augustine's
Episcopal church are straining every
effort to complete arrangements for a
bazaar which will be held in the Odd
Fellow's building on the evening of
December 15th next.
Fancy work of every description will
be on sale, and a large variety of
Christmas tree decorations will also be
disposed of.
Fancy and useful articles will be
offered at reasonable prices, suitable
for Christmas presents, such as hand
kerchiefs, aprons, dolls and doll cloth
ing. Mystery booth for men, women
and children; fancy cooking, sweet
girl, selling sweets; sandwiches, cake
and coffee.
The church is badly in need of paint,
and other repairs, and the proceeds of
this affair will all be used in having
the nccesarsy work done.
St. Augustine's church under the
rectorship of Rev. Shea has had a sen
son ot encouragement and real pro
gress. The services are growingly
attended, and what was once a
scattered few in the faith, has since
his installation here became ' a solidly
established mission.
Cheapest accident insurance— Dr
Thomas' Eclectic Oil. Stops the pain
and heals the wound. . All druggists
sell it.
Turkey Shooting.
Last Sunday the marksmen of this
city were given an opportunity to get
cheap turkeys. In many cases, how
ever, the fowls became very expensive
before the crack shots could claim
their prizes. Forty-three turkeys were
taken by various persons who paid 10
cents per shot for the prizes. One of
the riflemen spent more than twenty
dollars and received but four turkeys
for his outlay and efforts. Another
man secured six turkeys at an expense
of less than five dollars. Hay Ball of
Shenandoah valley owned turkeys and
conducted the match. The shooting
was held in therear of the Union livery
stable. •',.-.■■
On thanksgiving day another contest
was held, and a large variety of fouls
were offered as prizes, j Every kind of
a firearm from the revolver up were
used in the shooting.
Farmers, mechanics, railroaders,
laborers rely, on Or. Thomas' Eclectic
Oil. Takes the sting out of cv's,
burns or bruises at once. Pain cannot
stay where it is used.
Fix Up, Business Place
A cement floor is being laid in the
macarroni factory operated by Giovn
noni brothers, No. 79 Main street.
The large granite- crusher has been
given an extra grinding, and polish
ing at the Particelli brothers stone
cutting plant, and when the place .is
again put in operation, it will have
such improvements that will rank it
with a modern plant. • »,;:■
For buggies, farming implements,

Street Repaired
Main street is receiving a new road
bed in the northern section of the
town, which is greatly needed. Crushed
rock is being filled in at the low
places, and the center of the street is
given a rollinz pitch which will readily
shed the water and leave a good dry
street during the bad weather season.

ANOTHER TRIP
Ledger's Correspondent
Visits Sacramento
and Folsom
Nov. 20— Your correspondent, like a
migratory bird, has been to several
places in the last three months, all of
them possessing interesting features—
too much to take up in one letter.
l was in Sacramento for four weeks.
Well, everybody knows that Sacra*
mento is on the map, but few outside
the city realize <he building boom that
is taking place there. Keal estate
dealers are as busy as bees, buying
tracts on the outside of the city and
cutting them up into building lots.
Street work has been carried on ex
tensively, too, and the boom alto
gether, has advanced prices of realty
amazingly. It is certainly inflated
action that must reach a maximum.
Then the slump, and the small pur*
chasers loose. Tell a Sacramectarian
that, he'll say, "How can it?" Water
will reach its level, so will ' the con
ditions of . a city. There is another
tendency to .boom it, the influx of
easterners who are swarming west
ward. They hear of California as the
balmy sunny land where everything
can be raised . plentifully ' but $20
pieces; they must be coined, -and .if .1
am a judge, it is the real estate men
that are doing the coining, not by
dies as the government does, but by
speculative genius, they all seem to
possess.
I had the pleasure, while in Sacra
mento of seeing the world's famous
aviator, Chas. K. Hamilton fly. He
made three ascents and flew around
the fair grounds three times, alighting
each time with the ease of a bird. I
was told he made a poor effort during
fair week, but he retrieved it after
ward, that's certain.
I visited Folsom a few days ago,
and went out to see dredger No. 87
the largest in the world. It is a pon
derous piece of wood and iron com
bined, turned into actual work by the
genius of man.' It has been under
construction for nearly two years.
There are 40 or 50 men constructing it,
moulding it into shape. Nearly all
the iron .work is made'; at the com
pany's shops at Natoma with the ex
ception of a few pieces of heavy cast
ings, which are made in the east. The
machine shop at Natoma, owned by
the company, is continually turning
out new material that is worn away by
the ponderous action of the machine,
for this one would destroy 160 acres of
land in a single year— hence the wear.
I visited the Folsom prison on Sun
day last, but the warden's edict had
struck Sunday out on his map for
curious ' visitors — curious, I say, for
every one knows it is curiosity to see
the inside of a prison without having
the formality of a superior judge to
send you there with a permit to stay
from one to 20 years, or even a life
time, at the generous hospitality of
the taxpayers pf i the state of Cali
fornia. . ■ .
Well, I approached the outer guard
that sits in an easy chair before a
small iron gate that was wide open.
A Winchester y rifle was leaning
against the granite wall, and spoke
in silent volumes for itself. The
guard was an affable, Rood - natured
gentleman, suave in manners, and
obliging in character. The gun said in
pantomine, "Look out for the man,
he may turn me into a messenger of
death to uphold the law that man holds
as his perogative. " As I looked at
the man and conversed freely with
him, a reflective thought passed like
a flash through my mind— these men
are employed by the commonwealth
of the state, to guard the prisoners.
Suppose a man makes a leap for
liberty, it is natural, bang! goes the
Winchester, and down he goes; this
is law, this is order. He kills the
man because of duty. Now, my
reading friends, there is cause for
the condition that makes so many con
victs. They are not criminals by
nature, but by circumstances. Senator
Perkins said in a lecture twenty years
ago. "Hunger, squalor, and want,
know no law. The world's greatest
philanthopista and the political econo
mist are striving to bring about a
betterment of economic conditions in
order to aid the mass of human slaves
that are really slaves to their own
wants.
After 1 had been there for a half
hour the guard was relieved. He took
the seat, the other took the gun in his
hand and placed it against the wall
to suit him. He was altogether a
different sort of a man from the other,
florid in complexion, lymphatic in
tempermanent. There was a deter
mined look in his eye that gave you
the impression that he was tnere for
what was in it. He gave you to under
stand that he was there to shoot at a
man with the same deliberation that
he would shoot at a target. Another
man in livery came out and engaged
in conversation. He appeared from
both action and word to be more of
a humanitarian than the other. He
said, "Many ii man In those prison*
walls ought not to be there. One man
in particular is in there for 20 years.
He was a married man, and an agent
for pianos. A woman's treachery to
get one of those pianos for nothing
placed him behind the prison bars. It
was the work of an adventuress, using
her 14 year old girl as the bait to en
trap him. This I had straight from
the sheriff of the county that brought
him here. It was a deliberate conni
vance on the part of the mother to
force the agent to give her the piano.
Then her scheme failed, she turned to
revenge, and landed the man in ■ the
penitentiary by a triumped up charge
of the woman. "He is a smart fel
low," he continued, "he has con
structed the model of a marine engine
that experts say, is the best In ex
istence. Well it is a shame for
there is genius j housed in both peni
tentiaries that would surprise you. A
man in San Quentin has invented a
machine to detect fraudulent bank
bills. It is infallible, and certain to
be used by all the. banks., .
The conversation then turned upon
the markmanship of guards. "When
I was at San Quentin five years ago,"
said the guard at the gate, "there
was a demand for guards— men who
were expert shots. The test to get a
position was to be made at a target.
It was to hinge principally upon mark
manship.Two darkeys came up and at
tempted to shoot. One was driving
the center out of the target in a way
tnat made the rest of us look wild,
but the tallymen were doing their
duty, they were marking him out
every time. Finally the darkey caught
on, he pulled "out $300 in $20 pieces
and threw them on the ground with a
vim, at the same time saying,
"I'll jist bet yous gemmens dat 15
twenty dollar pieces dat I kin beat
any man shootin in de two prisons."
'/Did you pick it up said the other?"
"Not by a d— 'd sight, for we knew
he could do it, but we didn't want a
d— nigger round us. ' ' Such then is
only race prejudice for the darkey was
really master.

found dead in the vicinity of the court
house, and others in the outsirts of
the city. The yelping dogs started
their music about 12 o'clock, and con
tinued several hours.
It is a pity that the inhuman son of

Ellis-Whitaker Nuptials
1 The Ledger was in i error last . week
when it stated that Miss Martha Ellis
of Stony Creek and Low G. Whitaker
of Oakland were united in marriage by
the Hon. Judge Fred V. Wood.
The wedding was performed by
Father Greely in St. Patrick's church.
Miss Hattie Miller acted in the capa
city of bridesmaid, while John Ellis, a
brother of the bride was best man.
The bride is the only daughter of Mr
and Mrs Joseph Ellis of Stony Creek.
She possesses a charming disposition,
and enjoys the respect and esteen of
a large circle of friends in this county
who will wiah her a happy future in
her chosen path. The groom is the
eldest son of Mr and Mrs J. Whitaker,
and in a native of lone.
After the ceremony, the party re
turned to the ' Ellis home, where a
sumptuous and elaborate wedding
dinner awaited them. Many beautiful
and useful gifts were presented to the
newly weds. Mr and Mrs Whitaker
will make their future home in Oak-
Not Sorry For Blunder
"If my friends hadn't blundered in
thinking I was doomed victim of con*
sumption, I might not be tiHve now,"
writes D. T. Sanderson, of Harrods
burg, Ky., "but for years they saw
every attempt to cure a lung-raking
cough fail. At last I tried Dr. King's
New Discovery. The effect was
wonderful, it soon stopped the cough
and I an now in better health than I
have been for years. This wonderful
life-saver is an unrivaled' remedy for
coughs, colds, lagrippe, asthma, croup,
hemorrhages, whooping cough or weak
lungs. 60c, $100. Trial bottle free.
Guaranteed by Spagnoli's drug Btore.
Taken Suddenly 111.
The sudden illness ot his father, Dr.
D. S. Mason of Suisun, . caused Har
vey Mason of this city to make a
hurried trip to the home of his parents
last week. Dr. Mason was stricken
oh the street, and was taken to his
home in an express wagon, which
happened by. A communication was
sent to his sons, David and . Harvey
Mason, who are proprietors of the
National hotel, and in response to the
message, Harvey hastened . to his
father's bedside. The aged man is
reported to be but of danger, 'and Har
vey returned to Jackson this week.
Croup is most prevalent during the
dry cold weather of the early winter
months. Parents of young children
should be prepared for it. All that is
needed is a' bottle of Chamberlain's
cough remedy. Many mothers are
never without it in their homes and it
has never disappointed them. \ Sold by

Receives Compliment
IWe have received a copy of the
Boosters Edition of the Byron Times.
It comprises 100 pages,. with numerous
cuts illustrative of the resources of tho
San Joaquin valley. It is certainly
the most creditable special edition
issued from a ~ paper published at a
small way station like Byron, and
would do credit to a city paper.
Among the personal notices, George
"SalzKcber, formerly of Amador county,
is favored with a biographical sketch,
and a portrait. He is now filling a
position of responsibility with the
Pacific Gas and Electric Corporation,
having charge of the power lines from

working for the company for a number
of years, and has steadily worked up to
his present position of trust. We are
pleased to note this advancement by a
former Amador resident.
