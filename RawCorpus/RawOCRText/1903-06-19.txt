Scattered Too llneh.
' "It always pays to be conservative,"
said the careful man." "Now, I recall
the case of the man from Dyersville,
Dyer county, Tenu.
"'I can lick any man In Dyersville,
he announced one day In the main
street of that village.
"There was no response. 'I can lick
any man in Dyer county,' he then pro
claimed.
"Still there was no reply to the chal
lenge. Emboldened by the success of
hla bluff, the man shouted, 'I can lick
any man in Tennessee!'
."At that a long, lank mountaineer
peeled off his coat and wiped up. the
street with the boaster.
" 'Gentlemen,' said the braggart, as
he brushed off his clothes, 'the trouble
with me is that I scatter' too durn
much!' "
Exhausted Brain Cells.
■ Nerve specialists say that a great
many suicides are the direct results of
exhausted brain cells. When you find
yourself becoming morose and despond
ent, when you are conscious that the
pest of life is evaporating, that you are
losing the edge of your former keen in
terest in things generally and that
your life is becoming a bore, you may
be pretty s4re that you need more
sleep; that you need country or out
door exercise. If you get these, you
will find that all the old enthusiasm
will return. A few days of exercise' in
the country rambling over the hills and
meadows will erase the dark pictures
which haunt you and will restore buoy
ancy to your animal spirits.— Success.
Getting Into a Life Buoy.
1 The average person in danger of
drowning usually attempts to lift a life
buoy over bis bead, with the result
that he is immediately pJunged deeper
Into the water. A good swimmer can
do this with a sudden upward jerk, but
with the nonswimmer it is almost an
Impossible feat.
What he should do when he has
seized the buoy is to place both hands,
palms downward, on the buoy 6n the
part nearest the body, pressing it
downward and slightly away, when the
farther part of the buoy will rise out of
the water and actually fall over the
head. The arms can then be put
through easily, "and there you are."

"KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT"
People Who Say Little and Drtnlt
Leas "Get There" Ofteneat.
"Help me to catch him, mister," said
the small boy as he dashed by in pant-
Ing pursuit of his juvenile enemy.
"Keep your mouth shut, and you'll
catch him," advised the man, and the
boy understood in an instant and, un
derstanding, closed his mouth and ran
on, easily running down the object of
his pursuit, who had been running
rpen mouthed and • w-as soon doubled
up with a stitch In his side.
There Is a good deal in keeping your
mouth shut There are more people In
the world who never open a mouth
without putting a foot in It than you
have any Idea of. You may be a fool,
but If you keep your mouth shut
who's to know it? Generally you can
size up the fellows who'll get there,
are getting there or have got there by
the way their lower Jaw hangs. You
may occasionally meet a wise man
wandering around with his mouth
open, but not as a usual thing.
It's what people say and drink chief
ly that cause them to appear before
the police magistrate. If they had
kept their mouths shut they would
not have said It or drunk it. More fool
ish fish are caught with hooks in the
mouth than through the tall. The fel
low who goes around with his mouth
open may catch a few flies In the
aperture, but he Isn't likely to catch
anything very valuable that way. It's
the fellow who seta his teeth and con
sequently shuts his mouth who gets
there.— Toronto Star.
The Cipher,
It has not been definitely established
that zero was in use any earlier than
400 A. D. About this time it was used
In India, and several centuries later
the Arabs began to employ it Through
the Arabs its use became known to
Europeans during the twelfth century.
It was not generally adopted In Europe
until several centuries later, notwith
standing its great advantages. For a
considerable time there were two par
ties among the European educators.
One party, known as the algorists, far
vored the adoption of the pindoo sys
tem of notation (falsely called Arabic),
with its position values, while the oth
er, known as the abacists, favored the
Roman notation, without zero or posi
tion value.
The general adoption of the Hindoo
system was greatly facilitated by the
facts that It was explained In most of
the calendars for more than a century,
beginning with 1300, and that the
mediaeval universities frequently of
fered courses devoted to the use of this
notation.— G. A. Miller in Science.
The ArtiHt and the Woman.
, Every actress Is sensitively alive to
the pleasure of a warm reception— that
being the technical term for the ap
plause with which the audience greets
the first appearance of an artist before
any word baa been spoken. Generally
speaking, it signifies a courteous greet
ing corresponding to a lifted hat and
pleasant salutation. But on occasions
when the actress is a special favorite
the reception, enthusiastic and long
continued, becomes a demonstration
which is inartistic and destructive of
the illusion of the play, since it drags
the actress out of her part and in her
bowing, curtseying and smiling she
becomes Miss Jones or Miss Morris re
turning thanks to the public. A wom
an would not be human who did not
enjoy to the last drop of her blood just
Buch a greeting, even though her ar
tistic sense condemned it— McClure's.
Always In Demand.
, "I think gossip is never entirely use
less."
"You really think so?"
"Yes; It can always be used to satisfy
?ther people's curiosity." — Brooklyn
life.
Hardly as She Meant It.
Monument Man— What shall I put on
your husband's tombstone, madam?
Distracted Widow— Oh, say that he
was my husband and that he Is happy
now.— Life.
Those who pursue happiness are for
tnnate to catch up with content
Not Appreciated.
BJenks— lt certainly seems to me that
a man like BJnckson, who has worked
hard all his life and brought up a fam
ily of sixteen children, deserves a great
deal of credit.
Bjones— No doubt. But he can't have
it at the stores.— Somerville Journal.

■ The persecution, of the Jews in
v Bessarabia and other parts of Russia
"'has given birth to some discussion
?as to the propriety of other nations
■» protesting against such atrocities,
ilt is out of the usual course, for
nation to interfere in the in
ternal affairs of another. Russia,
j perhaps, of all the- civilized nations,
lis touchy on a proposition of this
; nature. She will brook neither in-
S terfererice nor advice from the out
j;sidel"' But there is historical prece
tdent for protest against religious
In the day^s of the
English Commonwealth the'Pta_B__u
tion of the peasantry in the~*PU
denses led to a vigorous protest from
-Protector Cromwell. He intimated
to the authorities that unless' these
were stopped a -fleet
" would be dispatched there for busi
■ ness. , And the persecutions ceased
without further action.
: The newspapers of San Francisco
have entered into a trust scheme.
r-The Call, Chronicle, and Examiner
announce that after July Ist the sub
scription price will be $8 per year
.by mail, or 75 cents per montn by
carrier. This is an advance of 10
cents per month by carrier. The
Examiner gets the best of this com
bine. It has always, been a higher
priced paper than its cotemporaries.
■In getting its two morning competi
tors to jump the subscription price,
20 cents in the case of the Chronicle,
and $2 for the Call, while its own
price remains about the same, it has
got decidedly the best of the bargain.
-The plea that blank paper has ad
vanced in price, and wages are on
-the up-grade, is gauzy. Tt seems
out of tune with the Examiner's
rabid anti-trust pretensions, to join
in a combination to raise the price
of news. Consistency is not one of
the virtues of yellow journalism.
History records no darker deed
than the murder of the king and
queen of Servia. Alexander was not
a model king, Draga was far from
being a pattern of moral worth, but
their taking off at the hands of a
brutal and cowardly soldiery, for no
particular reason except that the
revolted army wanted a change of
dynasty, is calculated to lift them
from the rank of mediocrity to the
plane of martrydom. The midnight
surprise of the royal pair, their pit
eous pleadings for life, in their ab
ject helplessness in the presence of
the military officers who by the laws
of the land and their individual
oaths were pledged to protect and
defend them; the brutal conduct of
the regicides after they had imbrued
their hands in the blood of their sov
ereigns; the gloating of the excited
populace over the assassinations,
and the burial of the dead in secret
at midnight, with scant ceremony,
after the fashion of plague-infected
corpses,, are all ! strangely out of
joint with this enlightened age. The
pretender Peter mounts to the
throne of Servia as the result of the
double regicide. The crown is hand
ed to him crimson-dyed with assass
ination. And the strange part of it
is that those who accomplished this
revolution are not to be prosecuted.
They are guaranteed immunity for
their misdeeds. And Russia, whose
protege and favorite the new king of
Servia is said to be, refuses to con
sent to the trial of the murderers
Why?
President Roosevelt has incurred
the displeasure of the executive com
mittee of the Western Federation of
Miners because federal troops were
ordered to Morenci to preserve the
peace which was seriously threaten
ed by the strike of the miners in that
camp. He is denounced as a tmitor
to the principles of organized labor,
and the toilers are urged to vote
solidly at the next presidential elec
tion against a system that requires
for its perpetuation a resort to such
"murderous implements of barbar
ism." Wherefore this rabid denun
ciation of the chief executive of the
nation? Nothing more intemperate
has been heard in # the councils of
anarchists. A strike leader, accom
panied by a number of men, waited
upon the superintendent of the
principal mine of the camp. The
leader was well equipped with all
the implements of gun warfare. The
superintendent was given one minute
to close his mine. In the presence
of superior force he wisely concluded
to obey the self-constituted authority
that for the time being was para
mount to the United States. Arizona
is a territory, and the cry for help
was promptly, responded to by a
squad of soldiers being hurriedly dis
patched to the spot to restore order.
Under the protecting wing of federal
authority the leading agitators were
jailed, and peace returned. We are
at a loss to understand what par
ticular principles of organized labor
President Roosevelt has betrayed.
Certainly he has by this action dem
onstrated his fideUty to the princi
ples of the constitution and the laws
of his country, which he had taken a
solemn oath to defend. It is safe to
say President Roosevelt will not lose
much sleep on account of this di
tribe; neither will he lose many votes
in consequence thereof.

Guaging Station on the Mokelnmne.
The subject of "storage of flood
waters" has been a subject that has
been freely discussed by the press dur
ing the past two years, but the public
do not realize the amount of work that
is being done in that direction by the
government, particularly so in Cali
fornia. • Thirty guaging 'stations have
been established throughout" the stato
on the various rivers of importance.
The Mokelumne has been selected as
one of the rivers necessary for fur
nishing data, and a station has recently
been established on the river, a- few
hundred yards below Electra. George
House,' the machinist at the plant, has
been instructed in the work. aDd will
do the guaging and readings required
by Uncle Sam. i.,S. G. Bennett of the
U. S. geologicalsurvey, is superintend
ing the work, and selected the location,
which is at a place I where the stream
runs smoothly and quietly. Tha river
iB about 100 yards wide at this point.
A strong cable is stretched from bank
to bank, and suspended from which is
a trolly car capable of holding two
persons. The car is used to ferry the
guager across the stream. At intervals
of about every ten feet the depth of the
water is measured, and the velocity of
the current is registered by. mean- of
an electric current meter^ by which
the volume of water passing may be
determined. This work is done at all
stages of the flow of the river, and in
due time the records will show the
amount of water that is annually pass
ing down the stream, which will be of
material benefit to the government in
the cause of irrigation. At the present
time about 2000 cubic feet of water is
passing in a second. If it was properly
cared for,' the , number of thousand
acres of land that it would irrigate is
almost beyond imagination.

In view of having a day's rest in a
week the business people of this town
have made the following Sunday -closing
agreement:
We, the undersigned merchants do
ing business in the town of Jackson,
California, hereby agree to close our
places of business on Sundays for the
entire day, from and including the
seventh (7th) day of June, 1903; this
agreement to be perpetual:

bread business).
We trust that this agreement entered
between business men will be held as
inviolable as law. Should any one of
the above signed merchants fail to
stick to the agreement, thus ignoring
his own signature, such merchants
surely are not entitled to the confidence
and patronage of the community at
large.

Deafness Cannot be Cured
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear
There is only one way to cure deafness,
and that is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous lining of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can be
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which ia noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars
for any case of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free

HIGH SCHOOL CARRIES.
Union District for the Taller Commands
Strong Majority.
The question of the establishment
of a union high school to be carved out
of eight school districts in township two
was submitted to popular vote in all
the districts Interested last Saturday.
Outside of lone the vote polled was
small. In lone the election awakened
much interest, evidenced by the very
heavy vote polled. It was a foregone
conclusion that as lone went so would
go the district. And the sentiment for
the high school was overwhelming, in
deed almost unanimous for the school.
The election was a one-sided affair.
Only two districts gave an adverse
vote, Lancha Plana and Camp Opra.
The vote in the respective districts was
as follows:
Yes No Total
Camp Opra 3 4 7
Lancha Plana 0 14 . 14
Mount Echo 8 0 8
Mount Pleasant... 3 1 4
Mt. Springs 7 0 7
Carbondale.. .7^ 0 7
Union 6 4 10
lone 141 22 163
Total.. 175 45 220
Majority for 130
The next step is the -location of the
school. There will be no contest on
this point. lone is the central part of
the district, and the most populous,
and the school will unquestionably be
there. They have had practically a
high school for several years, known
as the academy. The high school will
simply take the place of this institu
tion. The formal proceedings of locat
ing the school will be carried out by
the schooi superintendent, who within
15 days after receiving the returns of the
election, will direct each district to call
a meeting of the electors to select one
representative. The representatives so
chosen must thereafter meet and name
the school, and determine the location.
If they fail to agree unanimously, the
matter must be then reported to the
school superintendent, whose duty it
will then be to call an election to select
where the school shall be located. In
the present case, the location is virtu
ally fixed. The academy closed the
term last Friday. The high school
will probably be opened in September.
Excursion to Stockton.
A great ovent is planned for Stock
ton on Tuesday the 23rd inst., when
the Business Men's Association of "that
place will run their first excursion. It
is to be made a grand occasion intended
to show the people of the interior
towns how really good a trading center
Stockton has become. Within the
past year new life and energy have
been infused into the city until it has
become one of the busiest places of the
interior, and as an evidence of their
go-ahead-ativeness the merchants have
got together and projected a grand ex
cursion which leaves lone on tho morn
ing of the 23rd at 8:00 o'clock, reach
ing Stockton at 9:55. Returning this
train leaves Stockton at 5:00 p. m.,
reaching lone at 6:55 Thus giving
the people a fine day's outing- and al
lowing them tp return to lone on the
same day, or, if preferred, they may
remain over and take any returning
train on the following day (Wednes
day). It will be a jolly occasion, and
will no doubt draw people by the
thousands, as almost every merchant
in the city has made a special sale day
of it, and besides cutting prices beyond
all precedent, will give away some
bpautiful and useful article ranging in
value from $2 to $40; every visitor to
tho various stores being given a cou
ppn entitling him to a chance in the
article to bo "given away, without mak
ing any purchases whatever. By this
plan everybody gets a chance at every
store and as tho gifts in the aggregate
amount in valuo to nearly $300 it is
certainly a prize worth going for. A
fine band will be in attendance all day
and escort the excursionists to and
from the depot, as well, and other at
tractions will be offered, the details of
which have not as yet been fully de
cided upon. The fare for the round
trip will be the same as a single trip
ticket or $3.35 from Jackson and re
turn, so we infer that on Tuesday,
June 23rd, Jackson and the surround
ing towns will be practically deserted.
Fishing at Silver Lake.
Constable Laverone and Vie Rocco
started out over two weeks ago for
.Silver lake for the purpose of getting
a load of trout for market. All kinds
of rumors have been afloat to explain
their long absence. The weather since
they set forth has been unusually cold,
with probably heavy storms in the lake
region. It was reported that they were
srrow bound. All disquieting rumors
have been set at rest by the arrival of
Johnny Allen and Grant Shealor from
the lakes with 50 dozen fish. They
captured the game in the lower part of
the lake, whereas Laverone and Rocco
went to the upper part, in the pejghbor
hood of Plasse r s ranch. They brought
down the news that the absence of the
pair is owing to indifferent fishing.
They have tarried in the hope of get
ting a load U» justify the time and ex
pense incurred. Fish have been slow
to bite. The run from the streamlets
to the lake had scarcely commenced,
and this is the time— being the spawn
ing season — when the trout are readily
taken. The two fishermen are de
termined to fight it out with the
denizens of j the lake if ij, takes all
summer.

Bind Concert a Success.
The concert given last evening in
Love's Hall by the boys band from
tho Masonic Home near Decota, was
a decided success as an entertain
ment as well as from a financial stand
point. The hall was packed with an
appreciative audience. The boys play
ed well and conducted themselves like
old musicians. They were liberally ap
plauded and voted a success by all pres
ent. They will without a doubt receive
liberal patronage wherever they go, as
their cause is a worthy one and de
serving of assistance. Large numbers
of Sutler Creek people came over to
attend tho concert, A social dance fol
lowed the concert and was well patron
ized by the dancing public. The boys
will give a concert in Mokelumne Hill
tonight. The entertainment netted
the band $160.

in this line. On several occasions lately
he has exhibited his powers in the
presence of witnesses; not only in put
ting his subjects into mesmeric tranco,
but also causing them to do all sorts of
queer antics while under the strange
influence. It is the opinion of those
who have seen his achievements that
by devoting his attention to this branch
of study, he would soon equal, if not
surpass Prof. Fait, who is conceded to
be a past master in his profession.
Mrs. Ella Caminetti and Mrs. Delia
Jones returned Sunday evening from
Red Bluff, whore they had been attend
ing the grand parlor of Native Daugh
ters as delegates from Ursula Parlor,
Jackspn. Mrs. Caminetti was success
ful in her contest for grand vice presi
dent. This places her In line for grand
president next year. Miss Laura
Frakes of Sutter Creek was re-elected
grand secretary, and Mrs. Muldoon of
lone grand inside sentinel. Amador
county was distinguished above all other
counties in carrying off three important
offices. For a small county like this to
be so honored by the grand parlor is
out of the usual path, and certainly
speaks well for the ability and energy
of the members in this particular part
of tho state.

Bone Fractured.
While practicing ball . with other
boys last evening, Charlie Tarn met
with a painful accident. While in the
act of catching a ball he fell backward,
and threw out his right arm to protect
himself from a severo fall. The force
was so great however, that he broke
one of the small bones in the wrist upon
striking the ground. Dr. Gall attended
the injury, and Charlie is now carrying
bis wm. in & sling.
THE ITALIAN PICNIC
A Large Attendance — Jackson Base-
ball Clnb Defeat Angels.
The Italian picnic at Fullen'a grove
between Sutter and Jackson last Sun
day, attracted, as usual, a very large
gathering. The visitors were from
every part of the county, some travel
ing from the other side of Oleta. The
day was unusually cold and chilly for
the season of the year.' Indeed, it was
anything but picnic weather, and this
in some respects militated against the
affair, especially the financial part, of
it. The sale of ice cream and ice cold
beer was not as rushing as it would
have been under other conditions.
Nevertheless a thoroughly enjoyable
time was had. For the juvenile part
of the gathering a merry-go-round and
the patent swings were the attractions.
These were liberally patronized, es
pecially the former, which was kept
going to its full cajißcJly from "early
morn till dewey ovc/'-'i'lje proprietors
paid $50 for the privilege, and made, a
big clean-up. The dancing platform
was kept going all day. It was ideal
weather for dancing, and the lovers of
this pastime made the most of it.
Under the direction of grand mar
shal Jos. Ghilieri, the procession formed
in Sutter Creek and marched to the
grounds, acco.muapiej b.y the Jackson
band, which furnished- the music for
the day.
The literary exercises occupied the
forenoon, with W. Tarn as presiding
officer. G. Ghilieri of Stockton was
the orator in Italian, and Geo. A. Gor
don delivered an address in English.
The baseball game in the afternoon
between the Jewel Bourbons and the
Angels team was the feature of the
afternoon." ft w^s f,he bes|; ; contested
game that has been played in the coun
ty this season. H. S. Page of the
Standard EJectric ' Company umpired
the gaimo. He \a we,!) yerspd in al} the
dips, spurs, and angles of ' baseball
science, and gave general satisfaction
in the manner In which he fulfilled his
duties. The Jackson boys won the
ti-ophy, a purse of $50, with a score of
sto 4. ',•-.
The day passed off peacefully and
pleasantly. Toward evening theliquor
began tg talk witih a few, but no trouble
worth noting took' place. Sheriff Nor
man had a deputy on the grounds all
day, and was himself present during
the afternoon. Nothing, however, oc
curred demanding the interference of
the officers.
Tbe Traction Engine.
The advent of tne traction engine on
the lone road through D. MoCall, is
causing some uneasiness among team
sters and others who are accustomed
to travel that thoroughfare. All sorts
of calamities are prophesied as the out
come of this departure from long
established usage. It was the same
wjth the hpj§eless cajriaee in t(]ecit|es.
Domestic animals soon became accus
tomed to the change, and now are no
more afraid of the automobile than a
street car. It will be the same with
the introduction of the traction engine
in this county. Some trouble may be
experienced at tho outset, but in a com
paratively brief space this method of
freighting will be looked uppp as com
mon-place. It is not the intention of
the company to invade the towns with
the traction engine. The delivery of
oil and other supplies to the mines will
be done with horse teams as heretofore.
We understand that a depot will be es
tablished in the neighborhood of Mar
tell's station. This will be the terminus
of travel for the traction engine. From
this point the material will be taken to
the different mines with horse power.
At one trip the engine will be able to
haul up from 30 to 40 tons, enough to
keep one or two teams busy in convey
ing the same to near-by mines . The
road from lone to within about a mile
of Mountain Springs has been placed
in tolerably smooth condition for trac
tion engine travel. The rough and
rocky portion of tho highway from
Mountain Springs to the bottom of the
Morrow grade, is likely to test the en
durance of this kind of conveyance.
No doubt this difficulty can be over
come. At the Gwln mine the traction
engine has given such satisfaction that
auother and larger engine has been or
is to be put on the road. The first one
was a second-hand machine, put on
the road as an experiment. Now it is
reported that the experimental stage
has been passed, and arrangements are
being made \o adopt the method of
hauling as a permanent and profitable
business.
The engine was expected to start
work early this week, but owing to
some fixing required the initial trip
had to be postponed. It may make
the first trip to-day, or at the latest
Monday.

Grapes in Amador County.
J. H. BARBER
To ride through the vineyards of
Amador county at this time of year
and note the luxuriant growth of the
vines, or later in the season, at the
height of the vintage, to view them
loaded with purpie clusters of luscious
grapes, is to be convinced beyond
doubt that the hillsides of this county
are pre-eminently adapted to grape
growing. . Closer investigation of the
character of the soil, of the grapes
produced on it. and the quality ot the
wine made from them by good methods,
leads to the belief that our foothills
can compete in the production of high
grade wines with the foothills of the
coast range, which themselves are
competing successfully with the best
wine regions of the old world.
It is true that in quantity of product
the foothill vineyards cannot hope to
rival those of the valley, regions, but in
quality the hill lands easily surpass the
richer, heavier soils of the valleys.
This is as true in the foothills of the
Sierra as in those of the coast range,
and it is a point worth remembering,
as indicating the end toward which the
foothill vineyardist should strive. In
the production of low-grade, cheap
wines he can never compete with the
valleys; but in the making of light,
dry wines of high quality he has a
field into which they cannot enter. ..
Wine-making methods in this county
are as yet comparatively crude, the
wine going mostly intp t^e local market
on accoqnt ot the lack of cheap and
easy transportation out of the county.
But already some wine is being shipped
east, and with better transportation
facilities and more modern methods of
wine- making the outside market could
be easily and rapidly extended.
More attention must be given also to
the planting of the better varieties qf
winegraßes., wtyhout whlph'it is not
possible «« make high class wines: So
far, planting has been largely confined
to the most productive varieties, re
gardless of quality, b,qt th.c inqr« care
ful v|neyarqis.ts. whq make their pwn
wines are gradually introducing better
kinds fqr blending with the Mission
and other varieties of large crops but
poor quality.
A very interesting question in this
connection is the relative yield of dif
ferent varieties on our foothill soils. A
good idea of this may be gained from
the following figures taken from the
records pf tjie tf. S. Agricultural Ex
periment Station of California in this
county. The list includes the best red
wine varieties at the station, combin
ing quality with good bearing, and
gives the approximate yield of each for
the past flye yearg. r- : -, ..•■■ "
Bach variety at the station is planted
on both red and granite soil. The red
soil gives the best crops so far, and this
is the prevailing toil of the foothills
which would naturally be used for vine
yards. It is interesting, however, to
note also the yield on the poorer, de
composed granite soil. The vines were
bet out from 1889 to 1892, with some
later planting to fill vacancies in the
rows, wherg the original vines bailed to
grow. They have never been irrigated,
but have had good cultivation:

Aramon makes a good light wine of
moderate color but not high flavor. It
should be blended with a variety of
heavier character and deeper color,
such as the Malbec.
Carignane, Mataro and Mourastel,
make good wines of fair body and
quality. . •*
Charbono grows well and bears well
even on poor soil. It yields a wine of
good color, but ueutral in character
and not of high quality; very useful
for blending with varieties of more
astringency.
Malbec makes wine of doeu color,
with good body and astringency.
Should be a good grape to blend with
the Mission, so oommon In local vine
yards, to give color and character to
the poor product of the latter.
Mission (also known locally as the
"California grape") is well-known as a
vigorous grower and heavy bearer,
yielding well even with indifferent care.
It gives a very poor wine, however,
lacking in color, character, and every
thing else that goes to make a good
red wine. Fair wines might be made
from it by proper blending with a
variety of pronounced character and
color like the Malbec or Mondeuse; or
if neutral wine of good color were de
sired, the Charbono. Color alone would
be best imparted to it by a small pro
portion of one of the "color" grapes
Teinturier or Bouschet.
Mondeuse is an excellent grape, giv
ing wine of good color and body and
high quality.
Tinta Valdepenas is described by
Professor Bjoletti as "one of the grapes
most suited to the hotter parts of the
state for the production of dry red
wines." .
Tinta Amarella and Tinta Madeira
are good grapes of the port type. The
latter makes flue port of high quality,
which is improved by blending with
Tinta Amarella. The last named has
less character than the T. Madeira,
but as a rule bears bettor.
These brief notes are culled from the
reports of viticultural work at the
agricultural department of the Uni
versity of California, including practical
wine-making tests of the different
varieties.
Church Social at the Kennedy.
An ice cream social was given last
Saturday evening by the Kennedy peo
ple in their little church building
which netted $12.50 for Rev. G. H.
Van Vliet, pastor of the Jackson M. E.
church, who preaches at the Kennedy
every Wednesday evening. Instru
mental music was kindly furnished by
Miss Labadie, Mrs. Caminetti, Ernest
Osborne, and Henry Love. Several
recitations by the children of the Ken
nedy Sunday school, and a vocal solo
by Norma Smith. After the program
ice cream and cake were served, and a
social hour enjoyed.
Fred Van Vlietof Watertown, N. V.,
arrived in Jackson last Sunday even
ine, on iv visit to his parents, Rev. G.
H. Van Vliet and wife. Mr. Van Vliet
has been in poor health, and expects
to improve in California climate. He
will leave to-morrow with his mother
for Oroville, where he expects to take
charge of his father's farm at that

MIITING NOTES.
Pioneer District.— a carload of
ore from the claim recently purchased
by G. Andrews and G. W. Horn was
recently shipped to the Selby reduction
works for treatment. This ore. was
taken from below the tunnel level, and
Is expected to yield over $100 per ton.
At the Horn mine a contract has
been let to extend the tunnel 25 feet,
which Is expected to bring them to the
ore body, as indicated by surface croD

The Defender mill is kept running
steadily on rock of good quality,
everything looks prosperous about the
mine, and the machinery is now giving
satisfaction in every respect. "
Kennedy.— The machinery of the
new hoist is all in place. It has been
put in motion, and apparently works
smoothly and satisfactorily. It is not
doing any work, as the gallows frame
is not yet completed. This will take
several weeks yet to finish. The work
is proceeding slowly on account of
being shorthanded, lack of carpenters
being the chief drawback. The mine
is doing as usual. Occasionally a streak
01 high grade ore is encountered, but
not sufficient to make any material
difference in the monthly output The
mine gives employment to between 250
and 300 men, .
Argonaut.— A few men are at work
fixing the roadway so that material
may be hauled to the mine. Some
timbers have been ordered, and will be
hauled to the mine as soon as possible.
These are doubtless for repairing the
shaft. It will require some time to
place the shaft in working condition.
£usioesß men welcome this show of
activity at this property, believing
taat it is the forerunner of the resump
tion of mining on a large scale in the
not distant future.

A Stubborn Hnsband.
A most interesting phenomenon is
the stubborn husband. He is not a bad
man. He is contrary, and he has to be
managed. He Is usually married to a
clever little woman, who is constantly
devising schemes to accomplish tho
things which make their joint lives a
success.
He has no suspicion of this. If he
had, he would be so mad he could un
doubtedly eat her. So all through life
she goes on swinging a turnip ahead
of his nose to make him go the same as
though he were a balky mule. She is
a cheery little body, and she grows
plump with every year, and she does
her smiling behind the door or she
chuckles In her sleeve when he is not
by. The stubborn husband is as inter
esting as a bug.— London Standard.

Dnddhlst Prayer Wheels.
In the sacred city of Ourga, the head
quarters of Mongolian Buddhism, are
numerous "prayer ' wheels," inscribed
with prayers and dedications to Bud
dha, and the more they are turned the
more religious they make you. Many
of the more devout persons turn small
er wheels held in the left hand while
manipulating the large oue with the
right hand. Curious bits of rags fly
ing above the palisades of the Inclo
sures of the .town are "prayer flags."
No Mongolian house is without them—
the more the better— for each one is
supposed to convey a prayer to Bud
dha.
Don't Know Too Much.
There is nothing else a man so much
needs ns the ability to "make up his
mind." Men who have crowded their
minds have a great difficulty in "mat:
Ing them up." and Indecision is the fa
tal consequence. He who knows a lit
tle and knows how to apply <ft is more
fortunate than those with a superior
culture which paralyzes their action.—
Boston Globe.
The Obaervnnt Youth.
The pompous new resident had been
having a set-to with the smart boy of
the neighborhood. This was the young
ster's parting shot:
"Aw, you don't need t' think you're
no whole leglslacher Jist becoz every
body's al'ays presentin' bills to you!"—
Baltimore American.
No Cause For Alarm.

A Mistake Somewhere .
"Is it true, Miss Gertie," he said,
"that there are Just two things a -wo
man will jump at— a conclusion and a
mouse?"
"No," she answered; "there is a third,
Mr. Philip." : .
After thinking the matter over a few
moments he tremblingly made her an
offer, but she didn't Jump at it. Ho
was not the right man.

A FISH OUT OF WATEP
The Unfortunate Frolic That Canned
Its Untimely Death.
A German scientist— he could only
have been a German— once conceived,
we are told, a plan to train a fish to
live out of water. J He placed a thriv
ing little carp in a small tank and with
infinite patience and great exactness
removed from the tank one spoonful
of water every day,. at the same time
Increasing gradually the amount of
»xygen in the water. In time the wa
ter barely covered the carp, and still it
thrived. The quantity of water con
tinued to diminish, and, by slowly
adapting Its method of breathing to
the new conditions, the flsh began to
breathe air and Indeed became i quite
terrestrial In its habits before the tank
was entirely dry. The scientist had
grown to love the carp. He fed It from
his own hand,, and now that it was liv
ing in the same element 'with himself
he took it from the tank and left It as
free to follow its own devices as was
the family cat. The little flsh also
loved its muster. It followed him about
from place to place, flopping along aft
er him, stopping only occasionally to
leap for a passing. fly. One day the
scientist was crossing a bridge. The
carp, as usual, was at his heels, enjoy
ing the pleasant air of the countryside
and uttering from time to time a little
sound expressive of delight and con
tentment. About the middle of the
bridge a fat housefly was sunning it
self on the rail. The carp spied the
fly and jumped for it, but miscalculat
ing the distance went' over the rail Into
the river— and was drowned. — Great

Vnnpcange.
Language is the subtlest instrument
ever played on by man. Its variations
are illimitable— that is, they are limit
ed only by the powers of the human
mind and soul in all possible situations.
The power of words or speech exceeds
that of music because language is more
than music and even Includes music.
Language In the hands of a master Is
pregnant with every meaning.
A nation's language is at once an ex
pression and a mold of Its character,
reflecting from century to century the
development of Its civilization and its
advance In Intellectual and moral cul
ture, In learning and refinement. The
flexible Greek tongue was the product
and the instrument of the subtle Greek
intellect The distinctive qualities of
the classic speech of the Roman de
clare the dignity and the virile energy
which were inseparable from tbe old
Roman.— Portland Oregonlan.
How Romans Tools Their Food.
.. The Romans reclined at their ban
quets on couches, all supporting them
selves on one elbow and eating with
their fingers from dishes placed In the
center of the table. Each was supplied
with a napkin, and knives were used,
though it does not appear that every
one was supplied with one. Nothing,
It would seem, could be more fatiguing
than to partake of a repast In such an
awkward posture or less conducive to
neatness, It being almost impossible to
keep the hands clean even with water
supplied by the slaves or to prevent the
food and wine from falling on the
clothing and the draperies of the couch.
This manner of eating disappeared
during the dark ages so far as the
couch was concerned, but the peculiar
ity of taking the food with fingers from
a common dish continued afterward
for more than 1,000 years.
Tbe Hind Dnrlnar Sleep.
"During sleep," says an authority on
mental subjects, "the workings of the
mind are under no control, and yet It
seems to have a wonderful faculty of
building up and arranging scenes and
Incidents. I remember once having a
vivid dream of going into a house the
furniture and inmates of which ' be
longed to the middle ages. So clear
was the dream that I had no difficulty
in recalling it, and then as I went over
each detail of dress, armor, Jewelry, or
naments and other objects seen in my
vision I realized that everything I had
beheld was historically accurate— that
is to say, that probably in a fraction of
a second my mind had conjured up a
scene to construct which, with tbe
same faithfulness to detail, while
awake would have taken me several
hours."
Marvelous Memories.
Among men noted for wonderful
memories were Milton, who was said
to be able to repeat Homer; Professor
Lawson, who boasted that he could re
peat the whole of the Bible, except a
few verses; Lord Macaulay, who made
the same boast about "Pilgrim's Prog
ress" and "Paradise Lost;" Dr. Lerden,
a friend of Sir Walter Scott, who could
repeat an act of parliament on hearing
it read but once, and a London report
er, who took no notes, but could write
out an unexpected debate verbatim.
Henry Clay could not memorize a sin
gle stanza of a poem, but never forgot
a name, a face or an argument.
Mosquitoes are so numerous near the
coast of Borneo that the streams of
that region are in sutunTer often un
naxlgaWe.
How to Sell Goods.
. " Tou must know how to talk with a
customer so that, she will buy,' is one
of the things the'buyer says over and
over again in his lectures down in the
basement Even when the girl is be
hind the counter •at work the buyer
will often step up and give her a hint.
For Instance, he will give a new name
to an old piece of goods. There is ev
erything in a name. He came up to
me one day and said, 'Call that line of
goods the Marlborough,' and it was not
long before I had sold the entire stock.
The sweller a name Is the better, of
course. Cumberland pins will sell much
better than plain pins even if they are
the same thing. French names are
much In vogue, too, and they are some
times coined. Names taken from swell
sports are also very good- sellers. An
other thing, of course, which helps a
girl sell the goods Is genuine knowl
edge of them."— Leslie's Monthly.
Australians' Blgr Appetite.
Perhaps the most astonishing statis
tics in • Mr. Cougblan's book, "Seven
Colonies of Australasia," are those that
describe what the average Australian
eats and drinks. Apparently ' he has
the best appetite, if not the best diges
tion, of any human being on the planet.
He eats every year 264 pounds of meat,
which works out an average of two
cheep and one-fifth of a bullock for ev
ery man, woman and baby in Australa
sia. He eats more than twice as much
meat as the average Englishman, three
times as much as the average French
man and four times as much as the av
erage German or Swiss. He eats, In
addition, about 875 pounds of wheat,
225 pounds of potatoes and almost 100
pounds of sugar. If he is a Tasma
nlan, he eats a quarter of a ton of po
tatoes in a year, a quite surprising feat.
A Rare Old Boole.
The second book printed in the Eng
lish language was "The Game and
Playe of the Chess," which the title
page says was "Fynyshid the last day
of Marche, the yer of our lord god a
thousande foure hondred and LXXIIJ."
Only twelve copies of the work are
now known to exist In 1818 an Eng
lishman of the name of Alchorne sold
his copy for a sum. equal to $270 in
United States currency. Fifty-six years
later, in 18(10, the same volume (an im
perfect copy) was sold for $2,150. The.
British museum has refused an offer of
$10,000 for its copy, which is imper
fect to the extent of having seven
leaves missing. • !• ;:? \
Not the Same.
"If s a merciful dispensation of Prov
idence that makes consumptives al
ways hopeful. It's just heaven's mercy
that keeps them from realizing' how
bad they are."
"Huh! And what is it that keeps
some singers from realizing how bad
they are? Would you call that heav
en's mercy?" — Catholic Standard and
Times.
Marriage by Capture.
Marriage by capture is a very old
and very widely spread custom. It
prevails among the Hindoos, the Kal
mucks and Circassians and the primi
tive races of Australia, New Zealand
and America, but instead of abduction
being considered an outrage by these
half civilized peoples it is looked upon
as a preliminary marriage rite, and, as
a general rule, the coy damsel is by no
means averse to the mild violence."
Abduction became so common In Eng
land in the reigns of the Tudor princes
that a statute was passed on the sub
ject, and this was followed by an act
of Elizabeth which took away the ben
efit of clergy from the offender, and It
was not till so late as the reign of
George IV. that the crime ceased to be
a capital offense and punishable with
death.
What the White House Is.
To the American people the White
House represents the personality of the
president of the United States. To the
politician the magic words may stand
for the goal of an ambition too often
associated with the deepest and most
poignant disappointment, while to the
historian the name may. typify deci
sions that have marked epochs in the
affairs of nations. In the mind of the
people, however, the official character
of the building has always been subor
dinate to its domestic uses. Popularly
speaking, the White House is the place
not where the president works, but
where he entertains.— Charles Moore in
Century.
• ■ The Nurse.
The London Hospital complains that
the word "nurse" means too many dif
ferent things, from the board school
girl of fourteen, who gets 2 shillings a
week for minding the baby, to the
highly skilled nurse who follows the
army doctor to the very battlefield.
Ills Worst Experience.

tie. I experienced some relief the
first month, so I kept on taking it for
three months and now I menstruate
with no pain and I shall take it off and
on now until I have passed tht climax."
Female weakness, disordered
menses, falling of the womb and
ovarian troubles do not wear off.
They follow a woman to the change
of life. Do not wait but take Wine

ble. Wine of Cardui never fails
to benefit a suffering woman of
any age. Wine of Cardui relieved
Mrs. Webb when she was in dan-
ger. When you come to the change
of life Mrs. Webb's letter will
mean more to you than it does
now. But you may now avoid the
suffering she endured. Druggists
