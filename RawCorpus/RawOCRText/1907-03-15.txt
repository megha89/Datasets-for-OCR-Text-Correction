A careful record of meteors or

Donning, tbe great KugUsli authority

height at coumenrement of visibility
varied from 5!) to au miles, while
those at disappearance ranged from 22
to 50 miles. Tbe longest path noto'd
was 1 2 miles, tbe shortest being 21
miles, aud tbe velocities determined
were between 15 and 3D mites per
second. The reality of tho hissing or
explosive sound reported by some
observers of bursting tueteors seonu
to be a matter of doubt. Mr Denning
has never heard tbe sound himself,
nud some of tboi« reporting it bave

Electric sleep, or anaesthesia, is
prodnced by action on tbe brain ot

I'rof. Stephane .Leduo of Nautes and

perfected until it is practicable to
pat dogi and rabbits quiokly into a
calm and regular sleep, with geueral
and complete anaesthesia. In rabbits
at least the sleep can be safely pro
longed to eight hours or more, al

much risk after two hours. The

Letter.
Washington, March 1, 1907.
The past week has been devoted by
congress to the passage ot the appro
priation bills, which, as nsual, go', so
jammed into the last days ot the
session as to compel senators and
representatives to take oil their coat.
and hustle day and night to get them
through before adjournment. Very
low of the bills bave passed the ordeal
and bave gone to tire president, but
by working overtime aud ignorln^
the Sunday-alo9iug law, the legislat
ors will get all tbn .-uoasares out ot
the way befoie the clock strikes ot.L
on next Monday. In a general waj
it may be said that California has
been well taken care of by the dele
gation iv the matter of appropria
tions. Details will be giver, in tin
next letter. lint two appropriation.

bably amply suttloient for tbe purr oje
of the Japanese who desire) to migrati

Hon. W. A. Heard, executive oHicei
of tbn national irrigation congrest
to bo beld at Sacramento iv the fa'l.
has teiegraphod and written ti
senators i'ur Kins and KJiut suggestii g
an appropriation to permit tbe ri
clamation sorvice and forest servict
to make exhibits. Chief eugiueei
Newell of tbo former service an.) thi
otltjials of tbe forestry bureau were
in favor of making such exhibits, bi:t
the rules of ihe dopaitment prevented
them from making the nece3snry]ro
commendation, aud as there was rx
official estimate of cost before lie
somruittee it was not iv a posilior
to take action.
Ihe question as to placing ripr
• lives imported iv briue ou tho free
list is of great impoitanee to Cull
fornia growers, who bave manifested
a vory active interest iv it. The cast-
is on appeal botoro tho district ccuit
ot New York, aud if the California
growers make aa good showing, which
thny aro in a position to do, there
will bo 110 difficulty in securing a
reversal of the order of the New York
appraiser?. At tho time when this
case came before the board of ap
praisers, lion. Marion DeVies, ol
California, one of tbe members of
the board, was iv California, other
wise tbe decisiou would not have
been made as rendered, as bo is fully
aware of tho processes through wbicl:
olives bave to pass boforo tboy become
tic for table use. This process place
nil olives nndei tbe "prepared"
class, and thus subject to duty. The
other memborx of the hoard dooided
tho case 111 ignoranoe of the mcthois
of olive growers, and its ruling can
be easily reversed wheu the proror
showing is made. Mr Do Vries will
he iv San Krancis.lo about the middle
of March, aud will remain there, n
mouth or more, and bo offers to assist
the growers in prepaiing their case
for presentation to tho court. All
growers interested iv tho mattei
should, therefore, address him at the
office ot tbo appraiser, Custoai bouse,
Sau Francisco, and be will give siu b
assistance and advice will be found
necessary to perfect their case.
S«cretary Hitchcock has informed
tbe delegation that be has recousidei

to occupy a camp iv tbe Vosemite
valley for the annual session in 1908.
tho grand parlor, tt its spring meet
ing, can tboretore araku tbe uecessar;
arrangements. Tbe acting superin
tendent' iv charge ot the valley will
designate tho place for tho camp, aud
its oonstructio 1 and maintenance will
be under bis supervis<ion so the
natural beauty of the park ahull not
be marred. It ii probable that tbe
place tor the camp will be in the
vicinity of Xl Capitan rook, where
small [linos can be thinned out with
out detriment tc tbn valley.

has written to tbe delegation regard
ing a bill at the uext session for 1.
federal postolllce building in that
city. The business tbe office .has
more than doubled sinco 19012. J'he
delegation will work as a unit for

prospect that au appropriation for
it will be made.
(Jinoral Kdward S. Salomon ot San

case to senator I'ur kins, who has
taken before tbe treasury Jdopartmeo<

tnaun went to California, his will
following him two years later, our
tben he Hrst learned that the cticcl

wife had teen afraid to tell him tint

L»r. V. liehrend ot (Jermauy ha

the potato, which* has buen publia!ie<
as a aonate rJoefinieot. lie call
ittentioii to the importance, from a*
ocouomic poiut ot view, of cuulb
potatoos. Such caa bo used to make
bread, cake, etc., and can mso be si
.mimed as to require only to le
'):ikod iv the kitchen to serve th.
■wruo purpose as fresh potatoes. I'bi
use of tiesh potatoas as (odd*; is oi
course universnlly known, but Dr.
liehrend says that the incoureuieuc

of tho most important and prouti£iD .
of tho usesof alconol thus made is foi

A German Duel.
A young officer quarreled with n
friend who was a solicitor. Hot words
were exchanged, and the officer struck
his friend. Here the matter might
have ended— there was something to
forgive and regret on both sides. But
the officer's regiment heard of the af
fair, and a court of honor decided that
he must challenge the civilian. So a
duel liy coiiini:m*l took place, and the
young lawyer fell* mortally wounded
by his friend. When the officer re
turned home lie was arrested on the
information of the president of the
court of honor which bad forted him
to fight. He was tried by an ordiH-iry
tribunal and sentenced to three
months' imprisonment. The president
of the court of honor ki:ew he was
urging the officer to an illegal dead
wben he insisted ou the duel, but hon
or, as he understood it, must be satis

a an expensive kind that it was sup-

E England's "Fiery Dragon."
In the year 1332 various parts of
Great Britain were visited by a re
markable meteorological phenomenon,
which the old authors refer to as "tbe
visitation of the lire drakes or drag
ons." The author of "Contemplation
of Mysteries" says: "Iv ye letter parte
of . ye year-e (15o2) ye fieri dragons
appeared Qyiug by flocks or companies
in ye ayre, bavius swiues" suowtes,
and sometimes were they seeue foure
hundred flying togither." In speaking
of the fire dragons in another froi*tion
of his woil-; he says, "Common people
thiuke tire drakes to be spirits^which
watch over hiddeu treasure, but tbe
philosophers affirm them to be ye re
sult of poisonous vapors which are
spontaneously lighted in ye ayre."

County High School.
Toe Liedger U a.dvooatiug the
esUbliabmeatot a county high school.
There should certainly be sacb a
school in Amador nouoty. lone and
surrounding districts now have the
only high school in the county, and
possess a modern* and commodious
building. This should be the location
of one county high school and anothei
should ba located somewhere on the
mother lode near tho upper towns of
Jaokdon, Satter Creek, Amador City,
i'ly month aud Urytown. — lono Kobe.
lhere oan tv bnt ono connty high
school. There may be «s many dis
trict high schools as there are school
distriots. Bat the law provides for
tha establishment of but one school
maintained by a tax upon tho pro
perty of the entire county. And no
matter whether the property holders
of oue seotion are boariug the bunion
of maintaining a district or union
high school, they would not be
exempt trom the tax for the support
of tho county high school. We regard
the disoiiaaion of .the location of the
county high nchool at this juue
ture as unfortunate, and teudiug
to defeat tbesuooessof the movement.
Local jealousies should be kept
down, and must be kept down, it we
are to have higher educational facili
ties than we now have, and this
means no disparagement of tbo valley
union school. We should be willing
to let the particular location remain
in the background, until a favorable
vote has been secured on The sole pro
position of whether a school ot this
character shall be established. That
settled in the affirmative, the differ
ent localities can discuss the best
site for the school to the limit.
The legislature amended the law
passed by the legislature of two years
ago, wtiich prohibited a saloon within
two miles of the Preston reform
school at lone. This law, strictly
enforced, would have shut out every
saloon and hotel bar in the valley
town. Now the law places the limit
at I'JOO teet, which leaves the townsite
untouched. The change is a laudable
oue under the oircurnstanoes, aud
will relieve tho tense situation that
has oxisted in lone on this question
for the past two years. The act to
disrupt business interests that Irnve
existed in that town from a period
long anterior to the establishment of
the reform school wag a most un
righteous one. Aud this opinion is
vouchsafed without nny indorsement
of the saloon business as such.
A large area of laud iv Calaveras
and Tuolumne counties, temporarily
withdrawn trom entry by the depart
ment pending an investigation to
determine whether the same should or
should not be permanently included
in the forest reservation, has been
restored to the list of lauds subject to
entry under the homestead and timber
acts, it appears that the restoration
does not include any laud within the
limits ot Amador county. The infer
ence is that all lands withdrawn some
two or three years ago situated in
Amador ooimty have been permanently
included in the forest reservation.
The California legislature adjourn
ed sloe die last Tuesday. Iho law
makers assembled under a cloud,
which has huug over tbeui throughout
the entire session. Thuv haw ad
jourood with the "thank (iod spirit"
uppermost in tho [uihlic mind that
the end has been reached. It is n
teirible indictment of tho arernRO
legislature id these days, that it is
bold iu disrepute in tho light of an
organized band of looters uuder the
color of law. The meu who are sup
posed to assemble for tbe public pio
tection, and who are paid and em
ployed for that purpose, liavu fallen
so low iu public esteem that they
art) suspioloned ftom start to finish.

An Old Pioneer Dies.
i'etor Keiohling, a prominent citi
zen of this county up to within a
few years ago, died at bis home on
Liberty street, San Francisco, on
Saturday last, after a lingering illnesn
from the decline of vital force?
incident to ol<! age. Ihe passing ol
this pioneer calls for more than
ordinary mention, inasmuch as he
wa.s for many years identified with
busiDesa interests which have mado
Amndor famous throughout the min
ing world.
Deceased was born iv I'ruasia, (Jer
many, Dacsuibor 13, 1821, and was
therofore at tho time of his death tti
years, 2 months and 19 dayE old. At
tho age of 3*2 he left bis nirtivo land
:o try his fortune in the world-famous
Xl Dorado of the new world—Cali
fornia. Ills brother Frank Keichling
had preceded him, crossing the plains
to tbo golden state in full tide of the
gold excitement in 1319. The subject
of this sketch arrived In Volcano in
December, 1856. Tho mountain town
was then in its prime— the most
proliHo gold producer of the county.
With his brother be engaged iv the
business of baying gold from the
miners, la 1853, he moved to Jack
son, and opened a jewelry store in
the building now occupied by J. 11.
Lnnghorst, aud conducted a baukiog
and gold buying business there for
many year». The bulk of tho gold
extraoted from the earth in those days
from this vicinity passed through bis
bands. He was thoroughly posted in
the business), and strictly honest, and
therefore commanded the greater
share of this very profitable trade.
He was one ot a party ot capitalists
to embark in the development of the
Kennedy mine, and for ten years was
superintendent of that property. The
operating company quit, atfer experi
encing tips and (lowijp incident in the
history of nearly every rich gold pro
ducer, when the explorations had
reached nearly to the depth where the
mine developed tho richest
bonanza that Amador county has pro
duced, aud which is still a great pro
duoer, aud the largest employer nf
labor iv the oountv. In 18(11 he was
married to Miss A. Kroll. The' family
moved from Jackson about twenty
years ago to Chioo, where Mr. Ueichl
ing oonducted for several years the
largest hotel in that thriving town.
Subsequently he returned to Jackson,
and superintended tbo prospecting
cperations on the Anita miniug
ground, which proved unsuccessful
and were abandoned after a thorough
exploration to a limited depth.
About five years ago the family
moved to San Francisco, where they
have resided ever since. They passed
through the terriblo experiences ot
the disaster ot April last, and no
doubt the mental worry aud physical
hardships passed through ±ad some
efTect in shortening his day. Ihe

Capital Removal.
S Some of those who are discussing
t the proposition to remove the capital,
p particularly H. Weinstook, the Sacra-
m mento merchant, contend that '"a
m majority/ of the registered voters mast
v vote in favor of removal to carry the
p proposition, and that it requires more
t than a - mere majority of the votes
o oast. It this be true it will be very
d difficult to carry thejtmeudinent. The
l language; 'of the constitution i$ as ;
f ollows: i ■"
'.'The 'city ,of Sacramento 13 hereby
. .declared to bo the seat of government
o of this state, and shall so remain
u until changed by law; but no law
c changing the seat of government shall
b bc valid or 'binding unless the same
b bo "approved and ratiiied by a majority

p provisLpua,-, as . the- legislature, . by a

'The provision for adopting ordinniy
BtHCiiAratets is by a "majority at the
qualified oleutors voting thereon."
In regard to tbo change of capital the
language is "ratifled by a majority of

C Cleve Bell mid Otis French, the
l latter from Olota, wont to Oioville
i instead ot San Pinncisco as reported
l last week. ] A letter trom Cleve Be.'l
s says they are both at work. lie stated
t that the town of Oroville is booming.
T Tbo writer of this, lived with bis
p parents within 10 miles of Oioville
f from '49 antil '54, and it seems like
h heating from homo when getting a
l letter from those parts. Oroville was
t then a primitive mining camp, the
v vast stretch of unoccupied country
s stretching out tor miles in all its
v virgin wilduess. Feather river then
o one of the most beautiful streams,
c clear as the crystal^ of the waters of
N Naiad, gurgled, rippled and gully,
f flowed nmvaid in its course to mingle
w with tho Vuba aud tbonce on to swell
t tho waters of the Sacramento. Hun-
d dreds of Indians perambulated along
i its banks, or went in chaso of the
a antelope, 'that bounded over tie wild
w waste of unoccupied country. The
g grizzly bear, the monarch of the
f forest, was often seen slacking Its
. .thirst from its pure cleat water. The
o ooyoto hundreds in number, made the
i ijfight hideous with tlieir yelping; but
a alas, all the primitive attraction of
C California is gone. The Indian has
d dwindle to nothing in number, tho
a antelope has disappeared, and tho'
g grizzly uear is now a thing of the
p past. Where once was wilderness,
n now is thiiTing orange groves and
s superb mansions, and most of the
p pioneers have crossed to the great
u unknown' never to return. ■

B Bancroft's Aimer.
I have just heard* 'a good mot— lt Is
not more than a mot— of Bancroft, the
Americas historian, who Is aavr Unit
ed States minister -at Berlin; Loftus,
our ambnssndpr there, thought, I sup
pose, that the Yankee w-ns a fair and
would be an easy bqtt for.tUp shafts
of his peculiarly r.eflned wit, so at
tacks him before a hundred listeners
on some public occasion with" "Iv God's
name, Mr. Bancroft, wily don't you
Yankees send your representatives to
court like Christians, In a proper uni
form, instead of turning them out all
dressed in. black, like so many under
taken?"
Whereto Bancroft replies: "Really,
Lord Augustus, I am surprised that
you, as ambassador of the queen of
England and with those keen powers
of penetration for which you are so
generally distinguished, should hare
failed to perceive that we could not bo
more appropriately dressed than we
are at European courts, where what
we represent is the burial of mon
archy."—From Letters of Lord Lytton.
One Way Blind.
"You admit you are an Impostor?"
said the Judge.
:. "No, I don't, your honor."
, "You claimed to be blind, and yet
you ha.ye an unimpaired eyesight."
"That's true, your honor, but I'm
morally blind, sir, and not being able
to see the harm In my Innocent de
ception" —
"Six months," ejaculated the Judge.
Ingredients of the Play.
Half a tesct, a sprinkling of aristo
crats, a sin or two and a quantity of
good clothing are the familiar ingredi
ents of serious playwrlting, and It is
wonderful to see what varied and In
teresting results can still be obtained
from, the recipe.— Outlook.

Meeting of Cattle Men.
S. li. N. Klli*, superviaor of tbe
Stauisiaua forest reserve, which in
cludes that portion of reserve lanu
within tbe boundaries of Amador
county, was in Jackson Wednesday
and Thursday. His visit hero was for
tbe puipuse of meeting tbe stookmen
who aio interested in tbe grazing of
stock within the forest reserve, and
explaining to them tbe scope and
purport of tbe regulations covering
tins matter. Tbe cattle men gathered
in full force, about every man who
has beeu ranging stock iv tbe moun
tains during tbe brief summer season
being represented either in person ur
by pioxy. The cattlu business is one
of great importance in tbis county.
I'bousauda of head are annually
pastured on tbe ranges extending
from Antelope to Alpine county every
seasou. lleretufore tbo cattle have
roamed over government land without
let or binderance; no monetary com
pensation bas been required tor tbo
privilege. With tbe establishment of
fuiest reservations, ana tbe appoint
ment of a supervisor for each, string
ent regulations have been formulated
on this subject. A fee per bead is
exacted of tbs owners, aud everyone
wishing to use the forest land tor
grazing purposes must tiret make
application to tbe supervisor for a
permit. Failing to do so, be" is liable
to butb civil and criminal prostitu
tion.
The cattle men were naturally
anxious to tlnd nut all they could iv
regard to a matter which concerned
them so vitally, and heuce muster
ed iv strength.
A meetiufi was bold in the super
visors' room iv the afteruuon, aud
the situation was explained. Tbe
organization of a cattlemen's associa
tion was recommended, and tho meet
ing was adjourned until Thursday
morning at ten o'olock, to perfect tbe
organization.
Tbo government charges oii cents
per bead per season for cattlo grazing
within the reservation. No one is
permitted to graze more tban 150
head. Small cattle owners are allow
ed to unite in a pormit to tho number
of 150 head. The payment of the :S
cent fee applies only to tbe cattle iv
excess of the capacity ot the owner's
toe simple or patented laud. For
instane if a man has sutficiout land oi
his own to pasture all his stock, he is
not required to pay anything to me
government, or to make application
fai a parmit. If he has enough Jnud
of his own to carry 100 head, and
grazes 200, ho must pay for tho extia
100. Neither private nor government
laud is fenced iv that region. It v
impracticable to maintain fences,
owing to tho heavy snowfall, the
weight of snow destroying fences in
one or two seasons. This boing so the
cattle from ono range, will stray on
tho lands of another. This works
both ways, aud so is not takon into
aoccunt. An owuer having enough
land or his own, is not liable though
some of bis cattlo should stray ou to
the forest reservo land. Tbe capacity
»if the private k-uds to maintain the
number of cattle claimed is a matter
subject to scrutiny.
The (sharge or 35c pel- head, us
applied to tbo mountain pastnrage, is
considered a little steep. The season
nf pnstuiuge does not average. 1 more
tban four mouths, and when tbe ex
pense of driving the cattle to und fro
is taken into account, it is believed
this government tax will bave the
effeot ot driving small ownors from
the mountain ranges.
No sheep arc permitted to range ou
tbe western slope ot tbe reserve.
They aio allowed only on the eastern
slope. ' •
Thursday the stockmon met accord
ing to program, and perfected tbe
organization. The officers elected
are, C. L. Culbort, chairman; W. ?,
l''lnn, secretary; Ueo. Kukwood,
treasurer. Advisory board, C. liamert
Van Winkle and A. Camiuetti.
lhe territory covered by this
organization comprises all of Amador
p.onnty, and a portion of h'l Dorado
county, there bsiug no similai
association in our northern neighbor.
Calaveras county is included in
another association.
The object of tb4s organization is
to protect the Interests of tbe stock
men; to determine by aiutnal under
standing what poitiou ot the forest
reserve lands each shall be allotted,
tbe area each shall bo entitled to,
according to tbe number ot onltl*
pastured, and other matters tHtat
naturally fall witbin (be scope of
snob regulations.

a little Hungarian known as "LSis

examined for insanity and ordered
taken to tbe insano asylum at Stock

attorney's otllce we are infovmed that
he bas no knowledge of the man's
capture, that no committment for
insanity has been ordered in tbis

seen was an Italian who has be«u
around Amador City, for some time.
He has beeu missing trom there tor

How t« Be Ready.
To know hpw to be ready— a great
thing, a preefcus gift and one tliat im
. pliflp calculation, and decision—
to be always ready a man must be
able to cut a knot, for everything can
not be untied. He must know how \o
disengage what Is essential from the
detail in which It is inwrappe^d, for
everything cannot be equally consid
ered. In a word, he must be able to
simplify his duties, his business and
his life. To know how to bo ready is
to know how to start. It is.. astonish
ing how all of us are geuerallf cum
bered up with. the thousand and' one
hindrances and duties which aifr not -
such, but whith nevertheless wind us
about with their spider tlirwrrSs and ; '
fetter the lnoverueu't of our winsjs. It
Is the.lack of order which makes us '
slaves. The confusion of today-dis
counts the freedom ot'tomorrow. Con
fusion !s the enemy of all comfort, and
confusion Is barn of prosprjijtinatlon.
To know how to be ready we most be
able to finish. Xothinji is done' bat
what Is finished. Tbe things which we
leave dragging behind us will start up
again later on before iia and harass
our. path. Let each day take thought
for what concerns it, liquidate its own |
affairs and respeit the -day which is to
follow, and then wo shall be always
ready. To know how to be ready }s at
the bottom to know how to die.— Am lei.
The Lottery in Italy.

The chalybeate waters of Tunbridge

after that memorable encounter re
corded in the ofd rhyme —
St. Dunstan, us the- story goes,

I That the roots of many native plants,

p possess remarkable properties for the euro
o of human maladies is well proven. Even
t the untutored Indian had learned tho
c curative value of some of these and
t tauaht the early settlers their uses. The
l lndian never liked work so ho wanted his
s squaw to get well as soon as possiblc'that
s she might do the work and lot him hunt.
T There foro, ho dug "papoose root " for her, :
f for that was their great remedy for fe-
m male weaknesses. Dr. Pierco uses the
s same root— Blue- Cohosh— in his

bbined with other agents - that make it
m more effective than any other medicine in
c curing all tho various weaknesses and

It is now the general conclusion «f
scientists that light is simply the re
sult of vibrations, or waves, which oc
cur In a hypothetical substance known
as the ether, a substance supposed to
permeate all space and all objects and
to be coextensive with the universe.
According to this theory, when the
ether to caused to vibrate at a certain
rate It gives rise to the sensation »f
light in proportion to the rate of vibra
tion, or, in other words, the wave
length. In this way the various colors
are produced, red having the longest
wave length and violet the shortest
wave length of any of the colors — that
Is, there are more waves or vibrations
Ui a given time in the case of violet
tbivn in the case of red light. Briefly,
In relation to this peculiar phenomenon,
the theory Is that colored bodies owe
their color to the fact that they exert
a selective action on the waves or rays
of light which fall upon them, allowing
some to pass on and so give the effect
of coJor, while others are absorbed or
destroyed.

Soap a* a Medicine.
"When I was a boy," said the old
man, "they often made me take a little
soap as a medicine. It did me good.
"Soap was prescribed in the village
for cramps, for sick headache, for n
half dozen complaints. The people ad
mitted that it was a nauseous dose, but
on the other hand they pointed to its
efficacy.
"When I was taken down ray mother
would cut from the cake of yellow
soap In the kitchen a chunk about as
big as a chestnut.
" 'Now, sonny,' she would say, 'swal
ler this,' and she'd hold the yellow mor
sel in thumb and forefinger close to my
lips.
"I'd begin to whimper. The smell of
it and the idea of the lather that would
form In my mouth — the lather I'd have
to swallow— would fill mo with despair.
But my mother was Inexorable. With
stiff lips I'd take the soap Into my
mouth, I'd chew the soft and slippery
stuff a little and then, with a groan
aud a dreadful gulp, I'd swallow it.
Horrors!
"Horrors!" said the old man, smiling.
"I cau still taste those doses of soap
that were so common in the village In
my boyhood."
JorUii IlirUl.
The Allgeuielne Bundscau, Vienna,
in an article ou the Jewish question
and auti-Seuiitisin, has this to say as
to Jewish thrift: "If we couki only In
duce our own lower class to acquire
the Jew's thrift, hid Industry, his sense
of order, bis scrupulous exactitude, his
religious loyalty and love for his fam
ily the Jew on bis darker side would
appear far less dangerous to them than
la at preseut the case. If one Sunday,
by way of Interesting experiment, one
were to conduct an Inquiry into the
station, wealth and religlou of visitors
to the various public houses, the fol
lowing result would transpire: A large
number of the guests would be Chris
tians who would do far better to save
than spend their money In alcoholic re
freshments, gamins and tobacco. There
might be a few Jews, but at the most
they would content themselves with a
cup of coffee."
An Anolout Hebrew Bible.

Vt eight of a Lion.
'•Wknt does a lion weigh ?" Ask that
question of any acquaintance and see
what he will »tiy. Those who best
know the look of the king of beasts
and how small his lithe body really Is
will probably come furthest from the
truth. About 300 to 350 pounds Is a
visual estimate. But this is below tho
mark. A full grown lion will tip the
scales at uo less than 500 pounds.
Five hundred and forty pounds Is the
record for an African Hon. His bone
Is solid and heavy as Ivory. The tiger
runs the lion very close. A Bengal
tiger killed by an Euglish officer scaled
Q3O pounds. A tiger of tbis size has,
however, considerably greater muscu
lar strength than the biggest lioo.

THE AMAT)OH LEDGER: JACKBU&, UALIFqKNIA, FRIDAY. MARCH 15, liiOT.
Wfoaf FisliirK Develops.
To those T\ho are satisfied with a su
perficial view of the subject it may
seem impossible that the diligence and
attention ueeessary to a Bshennan'B
success can leave him any opportunity
while fishing to thoughtfully coutem
plate any matter not related to his pur
suit. Such a conception of the situation
cannot be indorsed for a moment by
those of us who are conversant with
the mysterious and unaccountable men
tal phenomena which fishing develops.
We know that the tnv fisherman finds
no better time for profitable eoutempln
tiou and mental exercise than wheu :ic
tually engaged with his angling outfit
It will probably never be possible for
us to gather statistics showing the mov
ing sermons, the enchanting poems, the
learned arguments and eloquent ora
tions that have been composed or con
structed between the bites, strikes or
rises of fish. But there can be no doubt
that of the many Intellectual triumphs
won In every walk of life a larger pro
portion has been actually hooked and
landed with n rod and reel by those of
the fishing fraternity tfian have been
secured in any' one givou condition of
the nonfishiug world. — "Fishiug and
Shooting Sketches," by Grovel- Cleve

An Old Havfleine.
"Ground oyster shells." said the pay
slciau. "were used as a medicine by
the mediaeval doctors— a medicine for
the rickets and scrofula."
"Flow absurd!"
'"Absurd? Not at all. Oyster shells
contain lime, nitrogen, iron, sulphur,
magnesia, bromide, phosphoric acid and
iodine. Those are all excellent tonics.
You know how hens eat ground oyster
shells and thus produce eggs with good,
thick, strong shells? Well, as the oys
ter shell powder acts on eggshells so I
have no doubt it acted in the middle
ages on the bending, crumbling bones
of the rickety, putting strength and
firmness Into them. Ground oyster
shells, I am convinced, would be good
things for frail .children today. They
would strengthen the frame, increase
the appetite and have a splendid effect
on the teeth."— Philadelphia Bulletin.
A Curious null Rare Book.
The most curious as well as one of
the rarest book.^ known to collectors Is
the edition of the Vulgate issued by
Pope Sixtus V. some time between
1585 and 1590. The book, as Disraeli
described it, "fairly swarmed with er
rata." So numerous were they that a
number of printed paper slips contain
ing the proper words were pasted over
the errors, aud, this device proving In
efficient on account of the immense
number of mistakes, as many of tho
copies as could be found were called in
and destroyed. Only a few remain, and
the book with its paper patches com
mands an extremely high price.
Soott'H Narrow RMCnpe.
The world had a narrow escape of
never having known a Sir Walter
Scott When a tiny babe he was left
in charge of a maid, but the girl's heart
was iv Edinburgh, whither she wanted
to go to rojoin her lover. She was,
however, compelled to stay aud look
after the Infant at Sandy Knowe. The
girl regarded her charge as an obstacle
to be removed and afterward confess
ed that she carried young Scott up to
the Craigs (under a strong temptation
of the devil, as she expressed it), fully
intending to cut his throat with her
scissors and bury him under the moss.
HlNtoric Grapevines.
The celebrated "king's vines" at Fon
tainebleau, planted under the reign of
Henry IV., grow against a wull in the
park not far from the castle, and the
gropes are highly esteemed by gour
mets. Since the republic was estab
lished the grapes have always been
sold by auction, the proceeds going

Mother Goose. ( V
The most popular children's book
ever written was "Mother Goose's Mel
odies." Mrs. Goose, or Mother Goose,
as she was familiarly called, was the
mother-in-law of Thomas Fleet, a Bos
ton printer early in the century. When
his first child was born his mother-in
law devoted all her attention to the
baby and, it is said, greatly annoyed
Fleet by her persistent aud not par
ticularly musical chanting of the old
English ditties she had heard in her
childhood. The idea occurred to Fleet
of writing down these songs and pub
lishing them in book form. The old
est extnut copy bears the date of 1719.
The price marked ou the title page
w;is "two coppers." This account of
the origin of Mother Goose Is discred
ited by some critics, who declare that
in 1097 Perranlt published "Contes de
ma Mere TOye," or "Stories of Mother
Goose." The name Mother Goose was
familiar in French folklore, being used
by writers of this literature over a cen
tury before the time of Perrault.
The StatuH of a Meteorite.
A meteorite full ou a Vermont farm
In 189 G. It was a valuable meteorite,
and the landlord at once stepped up
and claimed it. "All minerals and
metals on the land belong to me," he
said. "That's in the lease."
TSut the tenant demurred. "This me
teorite," he said, "wasn't on the farm,
you must remember, when the lease
was drawn up."
The landlord perceived the justice
of that claim. lie thought a moment.
Then he said decisively, "I claim her
as flying game."
But tho tenant was ready for him.
"She's got neither wings nor feathers,"
he said. "Therefore, as ground game,
sho's mine."
They continued their argument, and
in the bent of it a revenue officer, ar
riving with a truck, proceeded to put
the meteorite aboard. "I claim her
for the government," he said, "as an
article Introduced Into the country
without payment of duty."
A Hotel Kxuerlence.
One fashionable hotel on Fifth ave
nue refuses to give any receipt for
jewelry deposited in its safe or hold
Itself responsible for a greater amount
than #2>"U. Its explanation of this rule
is based on an experience which seems
excuse enough. Two guests of t)»e
hotel kept their valuables and money
in the safe. They left them there
when they went abroad, sometimes to
stay for six months. Once the wife
came back alone and drew out all the
money and^ valuables. As she had of
ten done so before the clerks gave the
box to her as a matter of course. It
was not until her husband had return
ed and wanted the same valuables that
the hotel knew of their divorce. The
husband brought suit and recovered
all he claimed. Since that result of its,
confidence in Its guests the hotel has
limited its responsibility to $250.— New
York Sun.
A Cholera Belt.
"The cholera belt," said a pale Anglo-
Indian, "is not an Imaginary girdle,
like your pie belt, but a real girdle,
which every foreign resident of India
wears day and night. In winter the
belt is made of heavy wool. In the
summer it Is made of light wool. It is
never taken off. Even when you are
sleeping iv a temperature of 105 de
grees, tossing and moaning and per
spiring, despite the punknh that fans
you from above, yon still keep on your
cholera belt, no matter what elso you
shed. Every Anglo-Indian has a couple
of dozen cholera belts. They are said
to prevent cholera, and I have no doubt
they do so. At any rate, I never heard
of any wearer of a cholera belt whom
cholera ever seized upon."
The Llsbt That Failed.
It was by an accident that Mr. Kip
ling got his famous title, "The Light
That Failed." He had almost decided
to call the novel "The Failure," al
though he was dissatisfied with this.
One evening as he was sitting iv his
study reading by lamplight the light
went suddenly down— almost failed, In
fact. Iv a second Kipling jumped up,
exclaiming excitedly, "By Jove, I've
got it!" Pointing to the lamp, he said,
"The Light That Fuiled."-London

An Abrnpt Finale.
Joaquin Miller had just wan recogni
tion as the poet of the Sierras and waa
working on a paper lv Oregon. He
had been coutributiu;,' verses and short
stories aud had just begun a tale about
the soldiers ou the frontier who suf
fered with scurvy. The editor wanted
the scurvy story for the maruing pub
licatiou, but Joaquiu Miller could not
concentrate upou his work. His mind
leaped to the anticipated joy of a great
social function occurring that evening,
for at this time he was a social lion.
However, he had proceeded in his story
up to the point of the conditional cure
for the disease where all the soldiers
suffering with scurvy had been buried,
with only their heads exposed to view.
The editor was yelling "Copy!" The
poet's mind refused to work. lie could
not Uuish the tale, leaving his soldiers
In such a plight. Suddenly an inspira
tion came to him. He grubbed his
pencil and wrote rapidly the following
■words:
"And a she wolf came along and ate
off all their heads." Then he made a
bee line for the door and was not seen
again until the next day. His story
was not published.
A Cuuae of Divorce.
"What is the most frequent cause of
divorce?" the lawyer was asked.
"It is nearly Incredible," he said,
"but a thing that causes divorce often
er than you'd Imagine is married peo
ple's quarreling over their right to
open one another's letters. The hus
band will claim that he is entitled to
open the wife's mail. The wife will
claim that she is entitled to open the
husband's. In the letters of neither
will there be anything of a private or
compromising nature, bul nevertheless
they both want to get their mail in

opened and read. Quarrels over this
letter opening question vex, I suppose,

this 00 per cent a distressingly large

Quick Wit Saved 11-ln Life.
"The strangest and most thrilling
piece of swordsmanship I ever saw,"
said the fencing master, "was in Ver
mout. I was spending the autumn in
a mountainous part of the state, nnd
there was n military encampment near
my hotel. Oue morning an officer's
horse started to bolt with the man
during parade and made at breakneck
speed toward a precipice. The offi
cer tried to stop the horse, tried to
turn his head — no use. On dashed the
frantic animal straight for the abyss.
We all held our breaths. In another
Instant we expected to see horse and
rider go over the cliff. But the officer
when within fifty feet of the edge
drew his sword and plunged It twice
deep into the horse. The horse stag
gered, slowed, keeled over, dying. The
man bad sacrificed the animal's life to
save his own."
Agf» In the Animal Kingdom.
A great variance as to length of life
appears among different animals. Some
Insects live for only a few hours, while
fish, elephants and turtles are fre
queutly centenarians. The average
life of the mosquito is three days.
Toads usually live to the age of about
fifteen years, while carp have been
known to reach 150. Chickens live
from twelve to fifteen years, dogs to
the age of ten aud occasionally fifteen
and parrots to extreme age. These
birds have'been known to pass the
age of 200 years. Turtles are also fre
quently centenarians, as are storks,
and elephants are said to reach the
age of 300 years. Whales have been
known to live for 400 years.
