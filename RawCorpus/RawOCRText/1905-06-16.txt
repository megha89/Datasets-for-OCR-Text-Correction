A Little More Gold.
"I don't think much of Miss Gret
ton, old man."
"Nor do I, now. When did you see
her?"
"Last night. It's a bad mess, i'ou
have wasted a lot of time over it."
- "i'es. I can't imagine what I was
at. I ought, to have done better. A
little more gold would improve mat
ters."
"I'd break it, it I were you, and
have done with it. "
"I hardly like to do that."
The two speakers went out again.
The moment they had departed a
girl came " out from a curtained re
cess. She was a charming little lady,
with fair hair and a pair of laughing
blue eyes. But now they were far
from laughing. She stamped her
dainty foot and tossed her pretty head
with an air of lofty disdain.
''The idea! So he's like all the rest,
is he— after gold. He ought to have
done better. Well, ne shall have a
obance. It be doesn't like to bteak
it, 1 do.
. After thus giving vent to her feed
ings she rushed frantically down the
stairs and rejoined her father.
The next morning Jack Rowlands
had a uhock. Instead of the usual
billet doux from Edith came a rather
bulky parcel. Quickly opening it, he
found all the little love tokens he
had sent her. There was the volume
of Moore's poems she had treasured
so much, a diamond ring, and a good
sized bundle of love letters.
On a gilt edged correspondence card
be read these words:
"I don't wish to see you again.
'. :■" .-;■" Edith Uretton."
• Tenderly taking up the parcel, he
locked it away in his desk.
"What was the meaning of it all,"
be aakod himself repeatedly.
The next morning Edith and her
father were on their way for a long
planued vacation in Europe. In a few
words she told him she had "broken"
with Jack, but he could learn nothing
further. She was terribly upset and
unhappy,
"O, now much she loved him! How
unworthy he was of any girl's love I"
At Brat the beautiful Swiss moun
tains and the lovely scenery around
JBerue helped to divert her thought,
but at best the time dragged wearily.
Her father saw all this, and looked
eagerly forward to the time when they
should go home. He hoped the little
rift was but a lover's quarrel.
iSut how was Jack faring all this
while? He was going from bad to
worse, from the day he received
Edith's parcel there was a marked
tailing off in the quantity and quality
of bjs stories. The editors called at
tention to it.
All the ladies were portrayed as
terrible vixens, while heroism and
trusting, faithful love were the sole
property of the men. In fact, real in
terest in his work had gone.
He would shut himself up for weeks
and brook no interference— not even
from his old chum, Ted.
Women were coquettes, heartless.
They sought a man's affection simp
ly to toy with. lie hated the sight ot
them. And yet did he?
Every evening he drew from its hid
ing place a little bundle of love let
ters. Over and over again he read
them ; and from his pooket he drew a
tiny photograph and kissed it. -
Ah ! bow he treasured that precious
picture! The heart hovers round these
sacred relics of the past. They may
be mere trifles, but after all is not the
world made up of trifles?
Again and again he racked his brain
in search ot some reason for Edith's
strange conduct. Why had she cast
him side with no word of explana
tion?
Suddenly an inspiration seized him.
He would write a Dook and reveal
woman "in her true colors. " He
would paint her leading on her lover
to the highest realm of joy and happi
ness just for the pleasure ot dashing
him down again. The book would be
the sensation of the year.
He snatched up his pen" while the
idea was hot. He was in the middle
of the first chapter when Ted bounced
in. Jack had forgotten to "sport his
oak."
"Hurrah, Jack," he shouted, "I've
got two months' vacation ; am off to
Europe Saturday." Then noticing the
pale, excited face of bis friend, he
said:
'Let me prescribe for you, -Jack.
Put all those beastly papers out of
sight, or, if you will, pack them up
in your bag and come with me. it
will make a new man of you.
"Thanks, old man — no. I've just
begun my life work — my masterpiece.
This book will take the world by
storm."
"It can be written as well, nay,
better, under the shadow of the Alps
than in the stuffy rooms. ' The novel
ist thought of Berne. He would be
nearer Edith. But, no — he darod not
go. It would only be tanning the
flame he was trying to kill.
Ted was in Switzerland. If only
Jack were there, too! Why shouldn't
he look up Miss Gretton? Why had
she thrown over Jack in that mysteri
ous manner? Who knows? Perhaps
be might be a peacemaker. He called
on Edith and her father. The old
gentleman tried to souud him on the
"split,"but Jack knew nothing.
Ted aud Edith were sitting out one
evening watching the sunset. It was

Gretton home and a certain evening, :
Ted would have liked to have won
this girl tor himself. She looked so
handsome — so winsome as she sat
there— though perhaps a trifle sad.
He was sorely tempted. She had of
her own accord given up Jack. Then
he thought of the lonely man who
oved her still, and he thrust aside
;he mad wish. Sv.---"f
41 Why did you give up Jack?" he
suddenly blurted out. He telt he must
say something to break the spell, or
his good intentions would melt like
the snow they saw before them.
"Can you ask?" she replied coldly,
"i'ou already know"
«'l— l—know!" and a wild wish was
father to the thought.
It was one of those evenings that
invite confidences. The sun was going
down, and leaving just a shimmering
twilight.
"Yes," she said sadly; "you were
really the means of bringing before
me the facts that made me wish to see
Mr Kowlands no more."
"He drew his chair closer to her.
"Do, please, tell me all about it,"
he said. His heart beat wildly. Could
it be possible she had broken with
Jack for his' sake? .
Then she described word for word
what she had overheard. ;
Vividly it all came back to him. He
was tempted for a moment, but for a
moment only. >
"My dear Miss Gietton," he said,
how glad I am I came on. to Berne.
We were discussing not you, but a
snapshot photo Jack had stolen of you
with his pocket camera. It's a. terri
ble thing. I don't think you would
recognize yourself. He aceidently
broke the negative soon after, and hi 3
only print is poor little pryo-stained
thing. He—"
"What!" Edith jumped up, her
face all aglow. "I never knew he took
pictures!"
"That was his first, and, what's
more," said Ted, "he carries that
wretched little photograph in a pocket
near his heart."
Two weeks later Edith came home.
In the Gazette she read the announce
ment that the celebrated novelist, Mr
Rowlands, vas engaged on a new
book.
"It is calculated to take the woild
by storm," the paragraph went on,
"and entirely upsets all the best tbe
ories about women."
She put down the paper in dismay.
She realized at what a price the in
spiration had been acquired.
"Give me the little photograph you
have in your pocket, "she demanded,
as the surprised Jack rose to meet
ner. :. ■
" She tore it into shreds.
"Let me be next your heart instead,
dear," she whispered

THE BOND REPEALING
ORDINANCE.
The lone Echo says' that tbe ordi
nance passed by tbe supervisors, re
pealing subdivision 3 of section 5 ot
Ordinance No 118, relating to the giv
ing of bonds by thn ■« engaged in the
sale of liquor, is defective, and con
flicts with the constitution. An ex
amination of tbe ordinance as printed
is sufficient to show that this con
tention is probably correct. Section
24 of Article i of tbe state constitu
tion reads as follows:
-, ; No law shall be revised
or amended by reference to its title;
but in such case the act revised or
section amended shall be re-enacted
and published at length as revised or
amended.
- It will not be disputed that this
provision applies to laws passed by
the supervisors, as well as general
'laws passed by the legislature. Now
the ordinance referred to disposes of
the mattter in this off-hand fashion.
The board of supervisors of the
oounty of Amador, state of Califor
nia, do ordain as follows :
Section 1. Subdivision 3of section
5 of ordinance No 118, providing for
the filing of a bond in tbe sum of
one thousand dollars, in support ot
a permit being granted to conduct a
saloon for retailing liquor and cigars
in the oounty of Amador, state of
California, passed and approved by
tbe board of supervisors of the coun
ty of Amador, state of California, on
the 7th day of June, 1904, is hereby
repealed.
The whole of section 5 is not re
enacted nor published at length, but
merely subdivision 3 thereof.
The question arises if this repeal
ing ordinance is invalid and void by
reason of this non-compliance with
the provisions of the organic law,
how will it effect those persons en
gaged in the liquor business who act
under its provisions. It may be said
that tbe ordinance is law until it
has been declared otherwise by the
oourt. But in tbe event of a test
case, and tbe court holding that tbe
ordinance was improperly passed, and
therefore void, it would simply
revive the subdivision as it stood be
fore; that is tbe provision regarding
the $1000 bonds would still be in
force. Would tbe bondsmen be liable
for the action of the principal in tbe
selling of liquor within tbe prescrib
ed limits of the Preston school?
These are questions that should be
carefully looked into, and no doubt
will be fully considered before any
decisive step is taken. .
AN ARGUMENT FOR
INCORPORATION.
Last week we called attention to
the fact that Amador county, through
its board of supervisors, had ignored
a request for a donation toward the
repair of the cemetery fence, which
inoloses the burying place of the de
cedents from the county hospital.
This action is so pregnant with mean
ing to the citizens of Jackson that we
think it not out of place to discuss
it at greater length. We are free to
say that the turning down of so just a
request was perhaps due to prejudice
against the county seat, rather than
the result of deliberative action after
a fair and careful investigation of the
merits of the proposition. Whatever
motive prompted them, we cannot
believe their repudiation of the coun
ty's dead will be sustained by the un-
prejudiced citizen, no matter in what
part of the county his lot may be cast.
The argument, if we may dignify it
by that term, that because the hos
pital is located at Jackson, it is the
duty of Jackson's people, and not of
the people of the entire county, to
look after the burial place of the hos
pital's dead, needs no refutation.
It is too preposterons to require an
answer. It would be just as reason
able to ask Jackson to feed and clothe
and maintain the hospital patients
during life, as to require that the
town take charge of their remains
after death. The one duty involves a
much larger expenditure than the
other, but they both stand on the same
footing. The authority that is charged
with the duty of maintaing the
living indigents, cannot escape the
responsibility of providing and caring
for the place of interment. But be-
cause the town of Jackson has in a'
great measure relieved the county of
this duty in the past, the board of su
pervisors have no right to assume
that the county can impose this bur
den upon them entirely and contin
uously.
This incident, more than anything
that has occurred for a long time,
ought to convince the people that the
incorporation of Jackson is the only
way of protecting the town against
such injustice. Unincorporated Jack
son, is powerless. The graveyard it
self is under the jurisdiction of the
supervisors. They can refuse to ap
proprite money for its proper care,
and can decline to let go to the citi
zens who would take care of it. With
incorporation, however, it would im-
mediately pass under tbe control of
the city government. The burial of
indigents one on top of another
would be stopped, and the county
compelled to look up a plot of its
own for a cemetery, and take care of
it with county funds. That seems
the only feasible way of solving the
difficulty. It is not only in this
graveyard matter that the leeliug of
jealousy against Jackson's growth and
influnce has developed. The control
of the town by the supervisors is
detrimental in o*ther ways.- At the
last meeting a petitiou was presented
asking for a reduction of the license
on shooting galleries from $25 to $5
per month. It was refused. It is
well know that Jackson is tbe only
town in tbe oounty where such busi
ness oould live, even at the reduced
rate. Ton denial, therefore, was a
slap at the oounty seat; a refusal, as
far as the board was concerned, of
permission to start another business
enterprise here, that cannot live
under the existing prohibitory li
cense.
With such a spirit directing affaire,
the county seat is handicapped. The
envy of Jackson was shown in express
words, as well as unjust action. It
is regrettable to be forced to admit
the display of such a spirit, but it is
no use to close our eyes to facts. We
must seek the remedy, and apply it
as soon as possible. And the remedy
is in our own hands. We can simply
take the territorial limits of the town
out of the hands of the supervisors,
and manage our own affairs to suit
ourselves. We are not compelled to
be at tbe mercy and dictation of out
side representatives any longer than
we choose to. We mistake tbe spirit
of Jackson's citizens if they submit
to such imposition indefinitely.
THE CODES AND THE
. LIQUOR BUSINESS.
As there is much interest taken in
the revision of the codes by tbe last
legislature, as affecting the sale ot
liqour, we have taken the trouble to
look into the matter, ana herewith
present the result, showing the law
as it stood before the codification by
the code commissioner, and the law
as it now stands as codified. Before
the code commissioner and last leg
islature muddied the question, the
law was embodied in secion 172 of
the penal code, and three acts bear
ing on the restriction of the sale of
liquor within certain limits. These
provisions are as follows:
Sec 172— Every person who, within
two miles ot the land belonging to
this state, upon which the state
prison is situated, or within one mile
of the insane asylum at Napa, or
within one mile ot the grounds be
longing and adjacent to the Univer
isity of California in Alameda coun
ty, or in the state capitol, or within
the limits ot the grounds adjacent
and belonging thereto, sells, gives
away or exposes for sale any vinous
or alcholic liquors, is guilty of a
misdemeanor.
An act to prevent the sale of intox
icating liquors in the immediate
vicinity of soldiers' homes approved
March 26, 1895.
Sec I— Every person who sells or
gives away any ale, beer, wine, cider,
or other intoxicating liquors within
one and one half mile outside of the
boundary line of the lands occupied
by any home, retreat, or asylum for
disabled volunteers, soldiers, or
soldiers and sailors, which has been,
or may hereafter be established by
the goverment of the United States,
within the state . of California, is
guilty ot a misdemeanor." etc.
An act to prohibit the sale of in
toxicating liquor in the state capital
—Approved and in effect April 16,
1880.
Sec I—Any1 — Any person or persons hav
ing in charge or control the state
capital building and allowing . the
same, or any portion thereof to be
used for the sale or distribution in
any manner, tor profit, ot any malt
or spirituous liqours, shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor, " etc. '
These were the laws as they existed
prior to the action ot the legislature.
These three provisions have, under
the touch of the code commissioner,
been coditied into the present sec
tion of tbe penal code, which has
caused so much discussion, and
which reads as follows:
Sec 172— Every person who within
two miles of the land belonging to
this state upon which any state
prison or reformatory is situated, or
within one mile of the grounds be
longing and adjacent to the Univer
sity of California, or within one and
one-half miles of the land occupied by
any home, retreat, or asylum for dis
abled volunteers, soldiers or sailors
establised or to be established by this
state or by the United States within
this state, or within the state capitol,
or within the limits of tbe grounds
adjacent and belonging thereto, sells,
gives away, or exposes for sale any,
vinous or acholic liquors, is guilty ot
a misdemeanor."
In a note explanatory of the section
as amended it is said.
The amendment consolidates the
provision of the present (old) section
172 with a codification of the statues
of 1873-4 page 12; 1880, page 80, and
1895, page 161, relating to the uni
versity, soldiers homes and state
capitol. There is no new legislation
in the section.
The statement that there is no
new legislation will be received with
a gasp in view of the effect which
the reoodifled section has had in the
town of lone and elsewhere, which,
were not affected by the old section.
The truth is it contains a great deal
of now legislation, which is plain
from a comparison of the old with
the new law. The word "reforma
tories" is inserted; Napa asylum is
left out, and Alameda county is left
out in the limitation of the univer
sity grounds, so that it now applies
to all the property of the university
whether in Alameda or San Francis
co. Towns are affected that were not
affected before; and Napa which was
concerned in tbe old section is re
leased under the new. It is a sweep
ing and radical change. That it
should pass the ordeal of both
branches of tbe legislature without
its tremendously enlarged scope
being detected is astounding, and can
only be explained on the theory that
the legislators depended upon the
judgment of the code commissioner
who recommended the change.

Indigestion Causes
Catarrh of the
Stomach.
For many years it has been supposed that
Catarrh of the Stomach oauied indigestion
and dyspepsia, %ut the truth is exactly the
opposite. Indigestion causes oatarrh. Re-
peated attacks of Indigestion inflames the
mucous membranes lining the stomach and
exposes the nerves of the stomach, thus caus-
ing the glands to secrete muftin Instead of
tho juices of natural digestion. This is
called Catarrh of the Stomach.

membranes lining the stomach, protects the

DOUBLE WEDDING.
The Methodist parsonage was on
yesterday morning the scene of a very
pretty wedding the contracting par
ties being Mr. Elmer Dufrene and
Miss Louisa J. Buddell, Rev. C. E.
Winning ofHciationg. Tbe young
people are well known and tbe union
is particularly promising of happiness.
After a honeymoon in San Francisco
the young couple will return to Jack
son where their future home will be.
The parlor of the parsonage was
beautifully decorated for the young
couple and by a happy arrangement
the same floral decorations which
beautified the room in the morning
were still in place when in the even
ing the mother of the morning's
bride, Mrs. Louisa J. Langdon and
Mr. . Caleb Chirm appeared in the
same room and by the same minister
and the same ceremony were pro
nounced husband and wife. Mr. and
Mrs. Chirm are well known in Jack
son and the Ledger tenders its hearty
congratulations. Seldom is a daugh
ter and mother wedded on the same
day. We trust the coincident will be
as abidingly happy as it is romantic.
Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a' bad sign.
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. For
weak indigestion, for defective nour
ishment, for consumption, take
Scott's Emulsion, it restores flesh
because it strikes to the cause of the
loss.

The readers of this paper will be
pleased to learn that there is at least
one dreaded disease that science has
been able to cure in all its stages and
that is Catarrah. Hall's Catarrah Cure
is the only positive cure now known to
the medical fraternity. Catarrah be
ing 1 a constitutional disease, requires a
constitutional treatment. Hall's Catar
rah Cure is taken internally, acting
directly upon the blood and mucous
surface of the system, thereby destroy
ing the foundation of the disease, and
and giving the patient strength by
building up the constitutional and as
sisting nature in doing its work. The
proprietors have so much faith in its
curative powers, that they offer one
Hundred Dollars for any case it fails to
cure. Send for list of testimonials.

CUTTING SCRAPE.
Joseph Sancnez was tlio main actor
in a cutting affray that oocurred in
Sutter Creek last Friday night. It
seems that the Italian couple who
skipped off to Angels to get married,
resulting in the arrest of Uanche, the
would be groom at the instance of the
parents of Bina Lepitich, the bride,
and were brought back to Jackson,
made up tho difference with the ob
jecting mater, and were married Fri
day, lv Sutter Creek, where the groom
lives they were enjoying a social
dance in celebrating the wedding.
Sanchez appeared at the house of
mirth. He is the same mustang
breaker who got into trouble in Jack
son two weeks ago by riding his horse
on the side-walk and into business
places in-Jackson. He was under the
influence of liquor. He wanted to
join in the festivities, and the desire
of the festal gathering was to get rid
ot him in the easiest fashion. He
promised to go if one dance was
given him and the crowd reluctantly
consented. But he was not satisfied
then, so one of the male participants
started to put him out. He thrust
his hand through the glass door.
When further remonstrated with he
drew a knife and slashed an Italian
over the heart. The blade did not
penetrate the cavity, but missed
doing so by a very slender margin;
The man is in a precarious condition.
Not satisfied with this he slashed a
another Italian, cutting his olothing,
missing the flesh. He then pulled a
pistol and fired two shots, both of
which went wild. He then retired to
his room, where the constable soon
visited him.' He feigned to be asleep.
The knife covered with blood was
found under his pillow. He is now
in the county jail, awaiting the result
ot victim's injuries. Sanchez came
from Texas about a year ago, and has
been in Amador and Calaveras coun
ty most of the time since. Sanchez
was taken before Justice Rose on
Wednesday, and had his examination;
He was held to answer, with bail
bonds fixed at 81500. His victim will
recover.

THE NEVILLS-FLKMING
CONI ROVERS V.
The law contest between W. A.
Nevills and ex-senator John P. Jones
on the one side, aud W. A. Fleming
of Chicago on the other, over the
Mammoth Tunnel and mine at Mid
dle Bar, entered upon another stage
this week. The suit for $150,000
against Fleming, tor balance alleged
to be due ou the purchase of a halt
interest in the property for $250,000,
is developing much acrimony and
bitterness Last' Monday an addition
al suit was started by Nevills and
Jones against A. Fleming arid E- P.
Raum tor $15000, tor wreoking with
dynamite an air compressor and ma
chinery that was placed al the mouth
of the big tunnel for running the
drills. Raum some years ago located
tho ground at tue mouth of the tun
nel, blocking the dumping facilities.
He has worked at intervals, iv pros
pecting. It is claimed from the plain
tiff's standpoint that Raum acted in
tnis matter with Fleming, and that
the two -vere iv conspiracy to injure
the A mad or Tunnel property. The
blowing up of the compressor occur
red two years ago, aud the per
petratois of the mischief were never
discovered. The machinery, however
bad been idle for years previous.
The work of surveying and samp
ling at the Mammoth tunnel and mine
iv the interest of the Neville side of
the case now on trial in San Francis
co, was finished last l-'i Ulay. A num
ber of witnesses went to the city
agaiu Sunday, among them W. S.

MINING NOTES.
Keuuedy— The east' ledge at the
'2750 teet has beeu pu.ised, and the
west vein is expected to be struck at
any time. The fact that the vein was
struok bo much further to the west
than was expected shows that the
ledge has been greatly deflected from
its usual dip to the east, and has
straightened up almost to the perpen
dicular. This is one explanation of
the ocourence. Another is that the
ledge may bare flattened at this
point, bo that the drift at the 2750
has run under it, and that the ore
body actually struck, is one of the
ledge? to the west. It will take con
siderable development to definitely
settle these questions. The mill is
running along smoothly, und the rock
is turning out a satisfactory yield.
Bunker Hill--At this mine the 110
stamp mill is kept running steadiy.
The ore body m sight is short, and
E. H. Harrington, the superinten
dent, is devoting considerable work
to prospecting, which up to the time
he took bold of the management had
beeu neglected, lie is very hopeful
of getting the uiiue on a sotiud basis.
The ore is of low average grade. A
new pump is soon to be installed.
The expense account has been ma
terially out down.
Mitchell— it is rumored that the
Mitchell mine has been sold. The
property is sitnated one mile north
of Pine Uiove. It has been idle tor
nearly three years. Negotiations have
been iv progress for mouths looking
to its sale. The property is consider
ed about the most likely iv that sec
tion to open up into a dividend
paying mine. The ore paid up to the
time of closing down; the additional
10 stamps to the mill involved the
owners in debt, and led to the
collapse.
Nearly all the machinery of the 40
stamp mill of the Ainador Gold tniue
in Hunt's* gulch has beeu removed to
the Voiuicb mine in Calaveras county,
where it is to be erected anew.
Aooordiug to the last report of the
Del Monte the prospects of the mine
have materially improved during the
past mouth. A small seam ot quartz
has beeu encountered in the upraise
which assays well, and promises to
open up iuto a good paying ore body.

LOST EVERYTHING BY FIRE.
Saturday night between 9 and 10
o'olook, the Dewittt dwelling house
on Murphy's ridge, two miles south
of Jackson, was entirely destroyed by
fire, with all its contents. The bouse
was occupied by Matt Thomas and
wife. How the fire originated is a
mystery, but it is supposed that a de
fective stovepipe was the cause of the
trouble. It was fully three hours
after the evening meal had been dis
posed of and the tire in the kitchen
had been allowed to die out. Still it
is possible that sparks may have been
smoldering all the time and. finally
started the blaze. Matt Thomas was
in Jackson at the time, Mrs. Thomas
had retired to bed, with a younger
sister, who was there for compauy.
Fortunately she was awakened by
something falling and rising to inves
tigate, as she passed into the hallway
the door and the flames burned
her face and hair. She had all she
could do to save herself and sister.
All the furniture and clothing, ex
cept that which she escaped in N was
destroyed. The beat was so intense
that it melted •• the money that was in
the house into bullion. The loss in
furniture and valuables is put at
$1000, upon which was not one dollar
of insurance. Matt Thomas has been
working on shares on a lease of the
O'Farrell mine at Middle Bar.

Hard muscles and strong body do not

gets all the nourishment out of all the
food you eat. It digests what you eat
regardless of the condition ot the

now seventeen years old. This boy's
mother died when he was three years
of age, aDd since that event be has
made his booie with bis grandmother.
The boy was educated there, and did
the work about the place too as well
as could be expeoted of one of his
years. There is a small orchard con
nected with the dwelling, and a few
bows were kept, which were dependent
upon the grandson's care. Ou a tract
of 160 acres about balf a mile away,
Mrs Williams raised a few bead of
3tock, eight or ten in the course of
a year, and in this way managed to
9ke out a livelihood, and with noth
ing to spare.
During Monday night the cows and
calves set up an unusual bellowing,
which was continued Tuesday morn
ing. This awakened a suspicion that
something was amiss. The cattle
plainly showed that they had been
neglected. So a boy, Clarence Crail,
was sent to the Williams' place to see
if the old lady was sick, and to enter
the house if necessary. The door was
unlocked, and no signs ot human life
were visible. Timidly the twelve
year old boy opened the door, wild was
in the room used as the sleeping apatt
nient of Mrs. Williams. He went up
to the bed, upon which Mrs. Williams
was apparently reclining. A pillow
was over the face. But ou reaching
the bed he beheld a great quantity of
blood, at the sight ot which he fled
terror stricken from the house, and
reported to the neighbors what be bad
Then all was excitement in the com
munity. It required little investiga
tion to impress the belief that a foul
Diurder had been committed, Mrs.
Williams being the victim. Reinov
iug the pillow from the tace, the wom
an's throat was cut, no doubt us she
lay upon the bed. There was no sign
of a stiuggle. The body was badly
ilecomposed, indicating that death bad
taken place thirty or forty hours be
fore. Moreover the boy Maker was
missing. He bad not been seen since
Sunday night. This deepened the
mystery, as he was looked upon as a
quiet inoffensive young man. No one
thought that he vas implicated in
the crime.
The officers iv Jackson were uotifled
by telephoue, and coroner H liberty
started early Tuesday afternoon to
bold an inquest. Sheriff Norman and
district attorney Vieiui left for
the scene, and also Die. fiudicott
and Gall to make the postmortem ex-
Reaching the bouse of horror, the
officers made a searching examina
tion of the entire premises. The cir
cumstances left no other conclusion
than that a terrible murder had been
perpetrated. Even admitting that
the death cuts might be self-inflicted,
the other circumstances proved con
clusively that it was not a case of
suicide. But the possibility of the
slashes in the throat being self-in
flected is disputed. There were three
distinct outs across the throat. One
reaching from the middle of the
throat, to the left ear. Another par
allel slash, in the same direction.*
Both cuts severed the windpipe and
the artery. Another smaller out, and
of a superficial character, may have
been made as the sharp instrument
was withdrawn from one of the other
fatal wounds. The deceased was
dressed, all the clothing being
complete " except the shoes and
overdress. The victim ' had evi
dently not retired for the night
when the murderous work was
accomplished. The pillow placed
ovei- the face concealed the stabs, lv
the opinion of the medical experts,
the knife was probably jabbed into
the throat with some force, and then
drawn to the left. One of the knife
Jezebel.
thrusts penetrated to the roots of the
tongue. About all the blood in the
body had passed through the
wounds. The crimson fluid had.
soaked through the two mattresses,
and formed a great. pool of coagulated
blood on the flour under the bed.
Thfe two front rooms were used as
bedrooms,- one occupied by Mrs.
Williams and the other by her grand
son. From the room where the body
lay, blood spots on the floor led to
the other bedroom. These are sup
posed to have dripped from the reek-
ing knife or fingers of the assassin.
The bedclothing in the boy's room
showed that it had not been slept in
since made. On one article of the
bedclothes a blood patch was found.
it seemed as if made by the laying of
a knife or other instrument thereon.
The piece of clothing was cut from
the blanket and preserved by the
sheriff as evidence. No knife or
bloody instrument was fqund in the
house or about the premises. This
fact iii itself was conclusive proof of
murder,
An inquest was held on Tuesday
afternoon. The jury brought in a
verdict that the deceased oame to her
death from wounds in the throat, in
flicted by parties unknown.
The disappearance of young Maker
is one of the inexplicable circum
stances. It seems that on Saturday
last he went to lone, and purchased a
pair of shoes for playing baseball.
These shoes was of a peculiar make.
Only one other boy in Lanoha Plana
has a like pair. Maker is believed
to have worn those shoes when he
left. Qq Sunday morning he went to
the river to Hah. He returned about
noon. It ia said that he fell in the
river and his clothing was eoakccl. In
the aftenoon be played baseball with
some boys, wearing the wet clothing.
On his return home he changed bn
olothes, hanging them up by the
stovo to dry. This was done while
the evening meal was preparing.
The two are supposed to have par
taken of supper Sunday evening.
After that Maker whs seen in the vil
lage in front of the saloon. This was
between eight and nine o'cock. It
waa customary for the old lady to
summon him home by ringing a bell.
It was the boy's habit to go to the
village of an evening, and chat with
his boy friends. The neighbors heard
the bell-ringing that night about 9
o'clock. Some say jhe was seen alive
about that hour. At any rate, the
notes of the bell are interpreted as
proof that she was alive and well at
that hour; that the murder had not
been perpetrated when the boy was
last seen in Lancha • Plana. The
crime is believed to have been com
mitted between 9 and 11 o'clock Sun
day night.
Footprints of these peculiar shoes
worn by Maker were seen along the
Mokelumne river below Lancha
Plana, at a point where an iron pipe
line crosses the river. He is sup
posed to have orossed into Calaveras
county over the pipe about 11 o'clock.
In the pocket of the overalls of
Maker hung up near the stove was
found a purse containing the sum of
$9.75. In the under mattress of the
boy's bed was found 65c— a 500 piece,
a dime and a nickel. A rent had
been made in the ticking. It seemed
like an old tear or rent. It is sur
mised that this place was where the
old lady or the boy kept ruouey.
Whether robbery waa the motive of
the murder, can only be cojectured.
It was reported that Mrs. Williams
was in lone in April last, and sold
some cattle. .This, however, was not
so. It has since been learned that
she sold two head of cattle to the
butchers iv Camp Seco, and was paid
$10 on account, the butcher owing
$15 still on the transaction. One
opinion prevails that the old lady
had money, although there seems
little foundation for this belief. It
is strange, if robbery was the in
centive, that the Cj cents should
have been left, and the money in
the boy's overalls.
It is known that the grandmother
and grandson had little spats, not
violent quarrels. It is said the old
lady had made a deed conveying all
her real estate to Chester; it was
placed in the hands of a third party,
who now holds it. She chided the
boy ut times tor not looking atter the
place better. Still he was regarded
by those who knew him best as a
good, inoffensive boy; that the
grandparent was inclined to be too
exacting, and that in fact the child
did better than the average boy of his
years.
There are two theories of the crime.
One, that the deed was the work of
outsiders; that gain was the prompt
ing motive; that the murderers made
away with the boy, after taking him
away from the house. This belief has
many supporters in the vicinity of the
homicide. Lanoha Plana people scout
the notion of the boy being the slayer.
Still there is not the slightest evi
dence cf search for plunder having
been made. Nothing was disturbed.
Furthermore, the hamlet is off the
track of travel; tramps are rarely
seen, and strangers entering the place
could hardly avoid being noticed.
The other theory, adhered to by nou^
residents, points to the grandson as
the criminal; that it was done in a
moment of anger, following harsh
words between the two. .
Meanwhile search for young Maker
has been made in every direction, but
not the slightest clew to his where
abouts has been discovered. Except
for the prints of the rubber soled
shoes plainly seen in the dust on the
highway below Laucha Plana, there
is absolutely no trace of him. And
the footprints are not conclusive. A
lady driving toward Lanoha Plana
about midnight Sunday saw a man
approaching in the distance. As he
drew nearer he swerved from the high
way, and acted in a manner that mdi-"
cated he wished to avoid the passer
by. The boy's father, Lee Maker,
lives in Sacramento; there are rela
tives in Stockton; None of them has
Been or heard aught ot him.
Thursday afternoon a searching
party was organized to search
river and brush and prospect boles for
miles around, undet tho impression
that the boy may have been murdeied
and his body left in some ont-of-the
way place. The search was postponed
until this morning.

YOUNG MAKER MURDERED.
Sheriff Norman started out early
this morning, accompanied by auoher
man, whose name we have not learn
ed. The Lanoha Flana party bad not
commenced their, search. About 8
o'clock they took the trail in a south
easterly direction from Lanoha, lead
ing to Westmoreland bridge. About
midway between the two points, and
half a mile from the Williams' home,
the, body of young Maker was found,
close by the trail. He was lyiup; face
downward, the back of his head
crushed in. The. sheriff notified his
deputy here as quickly as possible,
and the coroner, district attorney,
and Drs. Endicott and Gall started
for the scene of the newly discovered
horror about 9.30 o'clock. The trail
where he was found is on the route
to the Camp Seco mines. It is now
supposed that more than one person
was concerned in the double murder.
The sheriff is working on some clew.
An inquest on the body of Maker
will be held this afternoon. The
supposition now is that robbery was
the motive. A. Yoak who returned
from the funeral yesterday afternoon,
says that Mrs. Williams sold other
cattle, beside the two head to the
Campo Seco butchers, and had re
ceived $90. Young Maker may have
I returned home as the murderers were
engaged in the bloody work, and re
cognized the assassins. Probably com
pelling him to reveal the hiding
place of the money, in the ticking of
the under mattress, where the blood
clot was found, they took young
Maker with them, and murdered him
in the spot where found,' to prevent
their identity being revealed by him.

CAME TO MARRY; WENT TO JAIL.
That the coarse of true lovers does
not run smooth was illustrated here
last Wednesday night, when Tony
Buchi and Bina Lepetioh journeyed
over here from Jackson for the pur
pose of getting married. They stopp
ed in San Andreas, secured the license
and came on to this town, bat when
they arrived they found a telephone
had been sent asking for the arrest of
Tony.
The parents of the young lady ob
jected to the marriage, and as the girl
was only about sixteen years of age,'
the young man was charged with ab
duction; he was put in jail and the
next day an officer came over and
took them back to Jackson. Buohi

VI TAL STATISTICS.
All liirths and Deaths Must be Fully
Kecorded.
The new state law regarding vital
statistics provides that in the matter
of births the physician or midwife, or
the father if a householder, where
there is no physician or midwife,
must fill out a certificate giving the
place of birth, town, city, county,
street number and number of ward,
full name of child if named at date
of birth. "11 the birth is in a hospital
or institution it is sufficient to name
it. Attached to this certificate are two
columns to be filled out in unfading
ink, showing the sex of the child,
color, race, twins or triplets or other
number in order of birth, and legiti
mate or illegitimate. In one column
there must be given the name of the
father in full, his residence, color,
race, age at last birthday, birthplace
and occupation. The same facts must
be set out as to the mother. It must
also appear what number of children
the mother has had and the number
now living. Then follows the certifi
cate of the physician or midwife.
These blanks the county recorder
must keep in stock and supply to all
who wish them. The certificate and
blank must be returned to the recor
der within five days after the bhth of
the'child. If the child is not named
at birth a supplemental blank is sup
plied for the purpose to be attached
to the original. All the blanks have
broad margins for binding so that
they may be preserved as original rec
ords by the state registrar, to whom
the local registrar returns them. In
cities the local registrar is the health
officer; onitside of cities he is the
county recorder. s
Certificates of death are provided
for and must be signed by the physi
cian in attendance or by the cotoner,
to whom the case may be leferred by
the registrar, and no burial permit
can issue until a proper certificate of
death is made out. No undertaker can
bury, cremate or remove a body with
out a burial permit and a certificate
of death, lie is held jointly respon
sible for the issuance of death certifi
cates, and must see to it that they
are made as the law requires.
The death certificate, copies of
which the County Recorder must fur
nish to all who desire them, are very
elaborate, and must show the sex,
color, race, date of birth, age, wheth
er deceased was married, single, wid
owed or divorced, birthplace, occupa
tion, name of father maiden name of
mother, birthplace of mother, former
or usual residence, how long at such
residence, where the disease was con
tracted if not at plane of death, etc.
These facts must be certified by a
competent witness whose address is
to be set out in full.
A second attached certificate is for
use at hospitals, in sanitariums and
for transients. Attached to both is
the medical certificate of death, dura
tion of disease, etc.
The State Kegister is given power
to require all prosecuting officers to
proceed against all officiers and
people who neglect or refuse to com
ply with the requirements of the law
relating to these certificates of death,
birth and those essential to the is
suance of burial permits. The refusal
or neglect referred to is made a mis
demeanor.

kinds of notes, receipts, checks, etc.

Unhappy Women I
No woman can be happy when her
health is undermined. No woman can
have good health while she suffers from
female weakness, inflammation, uloera-
tion or any disease of tho delicate worn-
' anjv organs. Nervous, sleepless, fretful,
suffering in body and mind, she does not
live but only exists.
More than a half a million such women
have found a perfect and permanent cure
for their diseased condition in the use of
Doctor Pierces Favorite Prescription.
Women cured by this remedy say it is
a "wonderful medicine," so perfectly
does it restore them to health and come-
liness.
There is no alcohol in " Favorite Pre-
scription," neither does it contain opium,
cocaine, nor any other harmful drug. It
Is in the strictest sense, an honest, ter-
n■ peranco medicine. Its ingredients are
purely vegetable, and it will agree with
the most delicate constitution.
|-^S=° Don't be hypnotized, or over per-
"■^ suaded, into accepting a substitute.
This medicine has a record that's worth
far more than any difference In price.
Sick and ailing women are Invited to
consult Dr. Pierce, either personally or
by letter, absolutely without charge or
fee, thus avoiding the unpleasant ques-
tionings, offensive examinations and ob-
noxious local treatments considered nec-
essary by many local practitioners. All
correspondence treated as strictly private
and sacredly confidential. Write without
fear and without fee to Dr. R. V. Pierce,
663 Main Street, Buffalo, N. Y.

TUKN HIM DOWN.
Pretty maid, if you discover
That your ardent, pleading lover
Spends his time in loafing idly 'round
the town;
If the hair is carried bangy
Qn bis forehead, and he's slangy,
Don't you hesitate a moment- -
Turn him down.
If you note his eyebrows fusing
O'er the nose that he is using,
And the very least annoyance makes
He nas got a disposition
• That may land you in perdition,
And you'd better nerve yourself and
Turn him down;
If he pays no marked attention,
Doesn't even give it mention
When you meot him in a new and
charming gown,
Show him the door politely.
Tell him that his Sunday nigutly
Visits must be discontinued —
Turn him down.
If he talks about the races,
Calls the silver dollars "cases,"
Tells you how he "done up" Smith
and Jones and Brown;
If he meets you with a swagger,
And you catch the sniff of lager,
(jet your nerve in proper trim and
Turn him down.
Study well your pleading lover,
Or you may too late discover
That he'll place more thorns than
roses in your crown;
And if anything about him
Gives you slightest cause to doubt
him,
Do it in a gentle way, but
Turn him down.
HOW ANIMALS ESCAPE
EXXERMIN ATIO N.
How ia the balance of life on the
globe maintained? Why hare not spe
cies exterminated species? Why have
not tbe birds exterminated tbe insects
and hawks ant 1 owls exterminated the
birds? Because the insects are so
much more prolific than the birds
and the birds so tuucb . more prolific
than the hawks and owls. The hawks
and owls are more restricted as to
food. The more adaptive an animal is
the greater are the chances of surviv
ing. If wolves and foxes could browse
like deer and sheep and rabbits, they
would be as numerous as these latter
species.
The potato bug has unduly increas
ed in the East because its food is
abundant, and its enemies have not
appeared. The forest worms threaten
ed to destroy the maple woods of some
sections till its enemy, the ichnuman
fly> appeared. Kabbits have increas
ed unduly in Australia because their
natural enemies have not kept pace. —
Outiut;.
KEEPING AT IT.
It is a great mistake to suppose that
the best work of the world is done by
1 people of great strength and great op
portunities. It is unquestionably an
advantage to have both these things,
but neither of them, quoting from the
"Manufacturer ami Builder," is a
necessity to the man who has the spirit
and the pluck to achieve great results.
Some of the greatest work of our time
has been dove by men of physical
feebleness. No. man has left a more
distinct impressiou of himself on this
generation than Charles Darwin, and
there have boon few men who have had
to struggle against such prostrating
ill health. Darwin was rarely able to
work long at a time. He accomplish
ed his great work by having a single
aim, and putting every ounce of his
force and every hour of his time into
the task which he had set before him.
He never scattered his energy, he
never wasted au hour, and by steadily
keeping at it, in spite of continual ill
health and of long intervals of semi
invalidism, he did a great work, and
has left tho impression upon the
world of a man of extraordinary en
ergy end workiug capacity. Success
is rarely a matter of accident; always
a matter of character. The reason
why so mauy men fail is that so few
men are willing to pay tbe price of
self-denial and hard work which suo-
There is a Difference.
The diffeieuue between Kennedy's
Laxative Honey and Tar and all other
Cougb Syrups is that it moves the
bowels, thus expelling a cold from
the system. This relaxes the nerve
tissues and by its healing effect on tbe
throat and lungs tbe cough is relieved
—cured entirely. Kennedy's is the
original Laxitive Honey and Tar and
contains no opiates. Good alike tor
young or old. Tastes good. Sold by
