overturned the cart, throwing both
occupants out. Within a few feet of
where they landed was a deep shaft

this opening, to have fallen into which'
would have been instant death. The

Some very interesting and most ex

JAGKSON, AMADOR COUNTY. CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, JUNE 1. 1900.
THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
Importance of the Irriga-
tion Branch.
SUITABLE LOCUTION FOR H RESERVOIR OR Dm
The Boston Transcript Says, "That
Which Benefits One Fart
* Benefits Another.
The great importance to the West of
the work which the irrigation j branch
of the Geological Survey is doing is
perhape not as generally understood
as it should be. For come years the
Survey has been working along on
small appropriations, making! stream
measurements and " reservoir surveys,
but if the West is to attain its full de
velopment, through irrigation, this
work should be pushed, and 'reservoir
sites should be determined, 'surveyed
and set aside, subject to development
by private capital or government en
terprise. Persons familiar with reser
voir engineering ! know that ! nature
plays some queer pranks on individuals
and that what appears an ideal place
for water storage, may in reality, afford
a situation for a reservoir of great pro
portions. -
• The general mistake of the, average
person, Geological Surveyors say, is in
thinking that a canyon .with steep sides
and a narrow neck, suitable for' a dam
site, will make a practicable reservoir.
There are many such sites and the dam
construction would not be difficult, but
the slopes are too precipitate and the
amount of water impounded would not
be sufficient to warrant the construc
tion of the dam. The best sites ' must
include a neck,' of course, which can be
readily dammed; while the slopes should
be very gradual and the fall of the river
slight, — perhaps imperceptible! to the
naked eye— thus insuring a very i large
surface for storage. The descent of
some rivers is so rapid, that while to all
appearances they afford good storage
facilities, a dam of practicable 1 height
would not back up sufficient water to
warrant construction. v The catchment
area of reservoirs as well as the' annual
flow of streams must likewise be consid
ered. All these points can only; be de
termined definitely by the surveyor's
instruments, and so, if it is desired to
have definite information on such work,
either as regards private investment or.
ultimate government construction it is
extremely Important that the prelimi
nary work should progress as rapidly
as possible.
Congress is being asked for a good
sized appropriation this session with
which to carry on this work, in amount
$250,000, and the whole West, being
virtually interested, will watch for a
favorable action. '«
Hostility to irrigation has developed
in the East from time to time,' broad
minded expressions among men ' liberal
enough to see that what builds up - one
part of the country must feflexibly
help all other parts. -•■
It is pleasing to note that such a' far
eastern paper as the Boston Transcript
recognizes the fact that irrigation ap
propriations for the West would be
national investments, in the interests
of and for the benefit of all the ! people
of the United States. ■.'■■',
Quite a part of the annual outlay of
the nation, the Transcript says, ' is an
investment rather than an expenditure.
Public buildings are direct investments,
because they save rental to the govern
ment. In the case of certain other ap
propriations, the investment aspect,
while just as genuine is so indirect as
:to escape attention. An appropriation
for the improvement ol Boston Harbor
would be an indirect investment. ' The
cost of transportation is one of the
great public charges, the rates of
which bear directly upon the 'fortunes
of everybody. A deep channel to Bos
ton makes possible large ships and
therefore low freight rates. The gov
ernment in spending money for such im
provements makes easier the future
burden . of . its citizens and as the in
terests of the citizen and the State are
identical, this becomes an investment
pure and simple.
It is the same story, continues the
Transcript, with all worthy river and
harbor improvements; they are nation
al investments. Irrigation expenses,
insofar as they provide for permanent
works, come under the same' head.
National' expenditures of the invest
ment sort should be encouraged, es
pecially when the country is so pros
perous that it can bear its burden well
as against the time of greater string
ency.
It takes but slight study to see that
an irrigation appropriation applied to
any one section would almost immedi
ately help other sections. If the West
were fully developed, the East would
necessarily benefit thereby for western
money would flow eastward to pur
chase those things which the East
alone supplies and so through the pros
perity ot the irrigated West the man
ufacturing East would indirectly bene
fit by the opening of great additional
markets.

Hospitality and Generosity Noted :by J. H.
-• ,:-'■ r t 'Tibbits. '•"■•' "
'- PurJ Br*i-S ii — w^ . !..■■■
[ REDDING T HEE PRESS J
JN" H. Tibbitsithe mining' engineer,
has just returned from Trinity county,
whither' he went to examine and report
on the ■ Globe mine. He is naturally
somewhat reticent as to the results of
the examination,' as it was made for the
purpose ;«f; a suit; In court," and any,
publicity respecting his action would be
an impropriety not to bo countenanced
by counsel in the case. ; ~ ;-.
But Mr. . Tibbits 'was .favorably im
pressed .with ' Trinity as | a 'mineral
county." ■ He believes it has a great fu
ture. - Gravel seems to predominate.
He went over the LaGrange property
and witnessed the giants playing against
the banks several hundred feet high.
From the available ground that he saw
Mr. Tibbits Bays that it ; would J require
a century of time to work it out. - That
may seem -extravagant, : but the gold
bearing gravel in . that one property
seems virtually unlimited.
; Riding over the Last Chance Mining
Company's ground, recently purchased
of A: P. ; Paulsen and others, ,he saw
even more of productive ground than
in the LaGrange. The Last Chance
people have 200 men at work cleaning
out the old ditch and constructing a
new one. The company has solid faith
in the proposition, and from the enter
prise displayed it is impossible, from
Mr.'.Tlbbit's view point, that it has
made any mistake in the purchase.
Near the town of Weaverville sev
eral giants are working, in the day
light hours only, with evident profit to
the owners.
He saw a good deal of quartz prop
erty in the brief . trip that he made
through the county, and thinks it a
mere matter of j time when Trinity will
make a record ■as a quartz producer.
Many of the ■ quartz ledges are above
the water and timber line; but that is
an obstacle that can be overcome
there, as it has been in other high level
mining counties.
' Mr. Tibbits was royally entertained
at Weaverville. ■i He considers that
town ;as one would .a ; large j family,
where there is a unity of spirit and
purpose. - It is a typical California
mining town, ' where . the people act
harmoniously and hospitably, regard
less of previous or present conditions of
political or religious obligation, j
For illustration: He asked for infor
mation respecting an old friend, D. W.
Mclntosh, a mining engineer of promi
nence, and was told of his death in the
hospital, dying poor and lonely appar
ently without * friends; but, in fact,
wanted for nothing In the long weeks
of illness and laid to rest — not in a pau
per's grave— but in r a private' plot in
the cemetery by friends who loved him
in poverty as in affluence. .-
Sitting behind the stove in the Paul
sen hotel— for fires are an ' evening ne
cessity this time of year in Weaverville
—Mr. Tibbits was entertained by an
Incident illustrating further the great
heart and open pocket-book of Trinity
county. ■ ! . . ■
A poor woman with three or four
children and a dissolute husband was
reported to be "out of grub." ii It was
the work of five minutes to take up a
subscription that put the poor woman
"on, velvet." And one of the big
hearted'fellows called on the! sheriff
and advised him to meet the husband
on his return from the mine where he
was working for' good wages, and give
him a warm reception, warning him
that hereafter his - wages — and not the
money his wife. earned by washing
must be expended for the support of
his family. '" f '
■ Mr. Tibbits was not there to learn
the outcome of the sheriff's reception,
but was convinced that it had a salu
tory. effect . on the man who left his
family in want while he rioted on his
own earnings.
' On the way. home Mr. Tibbits was
particularly ' attracted by the s mooth
stage roads and the admirable service
of Jerry Culverhouse's stage line, and
the accommodation and congeniality of
the drivers. Both '. Mr. Culverhousa
and his employes seem to lay themsel
ves out to give the public the best pos
sible service, and they succeed.

Harked Cards.
Henry Lord de Ros was once said to
be one ' of the best whist players in
England. Subsequently, however, it
was discovered that he was in the habit
of aiding his skill by marking with his
nails the high honor cards of the pack,
so that he might observe to whom they
were dealt. During the scandal which,
followed this dsicovery a would be wit
who had never been admitted to his
acquaintance drawled out:
"I would leave my card at his house,
but I fear he would mark it. "
"That would depend," remarked a
gentleman present, "on whether he
considered it a high honor."
Girl's Esiay On Boys.
At a recent school examination for
girls this composition was handed in by
a girl of twelve: "The boy is not an
animal, but they can be heard to a con
siderable distance. When a boy hollers
he opens his big mouth like frogs, but
girls hold their toung till they are
spoken to, and then they answer re
spectable, and tell just how it was. A
boy thinks himself clever because he
can wade where the water is deep.
When the, boy grows up he is called a
husband, and then he stops wading
and stays out nights, but the grown-up
girl is a widow and keeps house."—

THE RAWHIDE MINE.
An Old and Tried Mine of Tnolumne
County Pastes Into Other Hands.
The San Francisco Chronicle of the
10th inst., has the following:-
"One of the most important mining
transactions of the week is that repre
sented in the reported sale of the Raw
hide mine, in Tuolumne . county. The
purchaser is an English syndicate and
the price is said to be $850,000. ' Three
partners are interested in the sale —
Nevills, Ballard and Martin. At one
time the property was valued at $1,700, -
000. t/ It , has, been classed fort many
years as one of the. most productive
mines in the State. Being a close cor
poration, the actual yield of the prop
erty was never made public. . It is be
lieved to be as good . today as | at; any
time in its history. Quarrels between
the three partners have disturbed its
management and depreciated its value.
As evidence of the faith of Nevills in
the mine, ho accepts a large proportion
of his share of the result of the sale in
stock from the new corporation.
"The Rawhide is one of those prop
erties which did not reveal its real
value until great depth had been at
tained on the lode. In fact, it was
virtually abandoned j for years as un
productive. But when the workings
were carried down ;on the vein the
lower levels exposed a great body of
high-grade ore, some of it being fabu
lously rich. | It was the results obtain
ed through deep sinking in this mine
that largely influenced the owners of
other properties to explore deeper for
g01d, ., and they were almost, if not
quite, as well rewarded for thsir pluck
and enterprise.
"Under the new ownership and new
management tho Rawhide will very
likely loom up again in the first rank
of gold producers in the State.",

FR1DAY....... .....:... JUNE 1, 1900
Nothing more disgusting has been seen in National
politics than the exploiting of the three Boer envoys, who are
now in Washington, by anti-administration Senators and
Representatives, to try to embarrass President McKinley and
to make Democratic political capital among voters who sym
pathize with the Boers in the unfortunate war in South Af
rica. The men who are working this game really care noth
ing for the Boers, but they think they see an opportunity to
use the envoys to help the Democrats, and they have so little
patriotism that they have undertaken the dirty job. This is
a new thing in American politics, but as the common sense
. of the country is behind the neutrality of the administration,
it is not likely to accomplish what its projectors hope for.
Heretofore, it has been the proud boast of Americans that no
matter how greatly we differed upon matters of domestic
policy, we always backed up the foreign policy of our govern
ment. The men who have destroyed our right to make that
boast have not done a job to be proud of. President McKin
ley will give the same recognition to the Boer envoys as would
be given to private citizens of any foreign country, who visit
ed Washington, no more and no less. They have no official
status in this country any more than they had in Europe,
where they made a number of ineffectual attempts to secure
official recognition, before coming to the United States.
Senator McCumber made a speech favoring our reten :
tion of the. Philippines, in which he said: "That it is to our
commercial and financial interests to retain them the most
ardent opponent of the Administration cannot properly
deny. That our naval interests demand their retention
must be admitted. Who would throw aside this wonderful
opportunity at the present time? The objectors to American
expansion claim that the same nation, which in May, went to
war for humanity, in December, went to war for conquest and
greed. Have they not faith in the honor and integrity of
their own country? Have they not faith in the sense of
justice of the American people? Then, act this faith and
trust your own people." ____- ■ "'.'■ ' :
. The flag of the Republic of the United States was not in
evidence to any great extent in thisvicinity on Decoration
Day. The beautiful and nobWsentiment which prompted
the setting apart of one dp.r'fn the year to the patriotic par
pose of paying just^Oute to the memory of a host of heroic
dead, is evident/© ll the wane in some localities. We regret
to see this^ck °f interest. In some sections of our country
on th^^th.day of last month on every flag staff waved "old
and private residences were draped in honor of the
-^brave men who gave their lives in defense of their country,
consecrating all that is best in manhood to the cause of the
Of the nine cases of so-called plague in the Chinese
quarter of San Francisco, no two cases have been the same.
The Board of Health of San Francisco has quarantined the
district, and the quarantine order keeps 20,000 people within
a prescribed limit. Chinese Consul Ho Vow takes the posi
tion that the municipal government of San Francisco is bound
to furnish necessaries for the support of the quarantined
Chinese.
The Democratic administrations sell bonds, but Repub
lican administrations pay bonds. For example, Secretary
Gage has sent out notice that the $25,000,000 of two per cent,
bonds, payable at the Government's pleasure, will be re
deemed on presentation, and that interest thereon will cease
September Ist, next.
Senator Clark's trick of having himself appointed by
the acting Governor to fill the vacancy made by his resigna
tion, has caused instructions to be given Senator Chandler by
the Committee on Elections, of which he is chairman, to push
the resolution declaring Mr. Clark not to have been elected
to the Senate.
Congress has formerly accepted the fine marble statue
of General U. S. Grant, representing him standing in full
uniform, presented by the Grand Army of the Republic. The
statue was unveiled by Miss Sartoris, a granddaughter of
General Grant, and Mrs. Grant and Mrs. Sartoris were pres
ent.
Congress will adjourn somewhere between the tenth
and fifteenth of the present month. The House will be ready
for adjournment any time after the seventh or eighth instant.
The exact date of adjournment depends upon the Senate.
Fourth-Assistant Postmaster General Bristow, who is
now in Cuba in charge of the investigation of the Postal Sys
tem, has ample authority to reorganize the entire system, and
make any changes he deems wise.
THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSON, UAIiIFORyiA, FRIDAY, JUKE 1, 1900.
EASTERN WASHINGTON.
Vast Changes Have Taken Place In
the Fait Twenty-three j Tears.
Having had occasion to go into
Eastern Washington a few weeks since,
the development of the country wa3 bo
great that- I was astonished; where
twenty-three years ago, I followed the
Indian trail, there is now a railroad
with' trains traveling at the rate of
thirty miles per hour. At one place
where my men and myself lay in a sand
bank with the finger upon the trigger
of the rifle through the long, long
night, now I see a busy population, and
almost upon the very spot of my sand
bed there is now a magnificent three
story hotel of forty rooms. Whore
the Indians held their dances is found a
prosperous population, with good brick
buildings and paved streets. At Spo
kane where the lone ferry-man would
give any poor devil his board only to
stay and keep him company, is a pros
perous city of 40,000 people' and still
they grow, aided in part by railroads
as a matter of course, but in the main
supported by the mining interests for
this great region of the North-west is
full of minerals, gold silver, copper and
lead. The forest lands are extensive,
and the lands formerly held for Indian
ponies is now settled by white families,
upon which as I ride along can be seen
the beautiful crops of grain and hay,
saw mills, shingle nulls, brick kilne,
lime kilns, in short a busy community
apparently happy in their daily toil.
Such a transformation scene I could
scarcely have believed had it not come
under my own observation. The peo
ple settling and developing that country
are from the east. I did not come in
contact with one that lamented the
days of 1849 and 1852. They buckle
down to the necessity of the times and
the country shows the earnestness of
their work. Chyuse, Laplay, Tacon
ion, Yakama and Goleville reservations
are now garden spots, where the
Indian and his horse roamed twenty
three years ago now peace and pleanty
with romping children, rosey cheeked,
are found almost everywhere. The
change is bo great that it is difficult to
comprehond. Their tnanufacturics
out vie California with all its boasted
wealth. We must be up and doing if
we do cot wish to become a past num
ber. John A. Faull.

Hay Prove a- Fortune.
The late George- B. Caneppa shortly
before his death made a will in which a
certain mining claim was given to John
Grillo of Volcano. Last week Mr.
Grillo prospected some on the property
and from a shaft about twenty foot in
depth extracted some quartz "lousy"
with gold. Some of this rock was
brought to Jackson and pieces of gold
three or four times as large as the
head of a pin are visible. :
. The claim is located about two miles
from the Defender mine and when the
deceased lived upon the property he
would take out enough gold in a few
days to keep him in the necessaries of
life for several months.
The rock now being taken out is ex
traordinarily rich, but its extent is not
known.

Bunker Hill— Amador.
A pumping station is to be put in at
the 100 level. -It is .now believed that
the old shaft will have to be entirely

of development work has been .done,
the Bunker Hill will doubtless pay fair
dividends. - :i :' ; -
Centennial— Drytown.
Sinking has ceased temporarily -and
drifting is in full blast at the Centennial.
The work is being done at the 600 level.
Fremont— Amador.
At the Fremont mine a body of good

shaft is being retiinbered, and a ; new
shaft is being sunk. The outlook is
cheering to those interested.
Philadelphia— Plymouth.
Quite a force is at work in the Phila
delphia mine, and from the appearance
of .things generally, the owners of this
property believe that they have some
thing worth getting aud they are going
after it with due vim and diligence.
Oneida— Jackson.
The new 60-stamp mill at tho Oneida
mine is being built as fast as possible.
The old shaft has been unwatered and
repaired down to the 1400. level. Good
ore has been exposed during the drift
ing at the 1500 level in the new shaft.
Supt. Truscott is well pleased with the
outlook and with the progress being
made.
High Point— Plymouth.
Those interested in the High Point
mine to the northward of Plymouth,
apparently have the courage 'of their
convictions for the work of sinking is
going forward in regular up-to-date
mining style. Prospects . are reported
excellent. ..
Bhenandoah— Plymouth.
S. K. Thornton, . superintendent of
the Shenandoah mine, seems to be on
the right lay. It is . reported', that an
ore body was recently encountered . In
this mine that has a tendency to stimu
late all interested. Plymouth people
are exceedingly hopeful and many ' of
them unhesitatingly predict that the
Shenandoah will ultimately surprise
the most sanguine stockholder. '-."-' "
Toman Property— Butter Creek.
A company has been formed to j de
velop the Toman property just east: of
the Central Eureka mine. We under
stand that C. W. Randall of San Fran
cisco, at one time a heavy stockholder
in the Central Eureka, is at the head
of this enterprise and expects to make
a second Central Eureka out of the
property, \ '■-; "-. ■ ?
Del Monte.
The Del Monte mine is, located in
Calaveras county, section 8, township
5, range 13, about nine miles north of
the Sheep Ranch, and 22 miles from
Jackson. The mine consists of seven
claims, covering about 120 acres. Con
siderable development work has been
done, the old shaft having been sunk
to a depth of 220 feet in 1874, during
which year a forest fire burned the
hoist thus allowing the shaft to fill
with water. A 900-foot tunnel runs in
on the ledge to the shaft, and rock
taken out of this tunnel is said to aver
age $11 a ton. A ten stamp mill in
good order is on the property, Union
concentrators being used. The old
shaft has been unwatered by the own
ers of the property, Messrs. O'Neill &
- Son, and a bond on the property has
recently been taken by Messrs. Truman
Schenck, late of Salt Lake City," and
George I. Wright of Jackson, who
purpose incorporating a company at
once and thoroughly develop the prop
erty. Specimens of rock from all parts
of the mine are on exhibition at Mr.
Central Eureka— Sutter Creek.
Supt. Thomas is pushing work on
the new mill as rapidly as possible, the
frame work being finished. Sinking is
in progress and development work is
in progress at the 1400 and 1600 levels.
Peerless— Jackson.
The shaft at the Peerless mine is
down to a depth of 260 feet, and with
depth the indications improve. Four
feet of high grade quartz is now shown
in the shaft and the width is gradually
increasing. Supt. Henry Osborne now
expresses himself as being morally cer
tain that he has found what he was
hunting for, namely, a valuable gold
mine between Jackson and the Mokel
umne river. In fact,* unless the best of
signs fail, the Peerless property is des
tined to become of great value.'
CALAVERAS COUNTY-

tions for the season and will go back to
Pennsylvania in a short time. There
is a pretty well grounded report that
Mr. Emery may represent^ his Pennsyl
vania district in Congress the coming
term. He has just completed the re
modeling of the old Doghl building in
El Dorado, by giving the front a coat
of paint; It is now a handsome and
well appointed hotel.
Citizen: A force of men are working
at the Kentucky on the arranging of
the new pump and pipes and work will
be steadily pushed along from this time
on.
The work at the Commodore at pres
ent consists of straightening the shaft
and repairing the same preparatory to
sinking deeper, and further crosscut
ting;. '■ ' ■ ,
The mill at the Ford mine will start
to run on rock from the 100 and 300
foot levels of the mine next week. Mr.
Condlt of the Standard Electric Com
pany has been rearranging some of the
electrical appliances there this week,
and all is about in readiness now for
the mill to start up.
Some ' very rich rock has been re
cently found at the Ritter mine, at El
Dorado, ore picked up from the dump
being 4iteralty filled with gold. Sam
Redmond and Mike Rigney are still
pushing the tunnel in, and the pros
pect in the tunnel is most flattering.
The boys are both deserving of their
coming good fortune.
The McGuirk mine, near town, now
has v force of about eight men work-
Ing, and the manager, Chris Masterson
was in town a few days ago hunting for
a few more men. This property was
recently \ bonded \by Philip Deides
helmer for two years for $40,000, and
the shaft Is . now, down forty feet and
sinking. is going on as fast as possible.
They have a vein of between four and
five feet which is widening, and the
rock is similar to that of the Commo
dore and the prospects are that it will
be a good paying proposition.
Chronicle: < The latest reports from
the French : Hill tunnel , as we go .to
press are to the effect that the vein
has proved to bo much wider than it
was at first believed to be and shows at
present about nine feet of fine looking
ore which carries a very high percent
age of \ sulphurate. The prospect in
free gold Tis very satisfactory and a
quantity of - the sulphurets has been
sent to the assayer, the returns of
which have not yet been received. .As
a whole, the results so far are anything
but discouraging, and we expect in our
next issue to have still better news to
chronicle,
At the Sampson mine in Glencoe dis
trict, owned and operated by S. H.
Krim, a tunnel is being run to tap the
vein. This tunnel has reached a depth
of sixty feet and it is expected that the
ledge. .will bo encountered' within a
further depth of about twelve feet, at
which point a backing or sloping will
be secured. With a tunnel 300 feet in
length on the same grade 800 feet of
sloping could be . had. . The lead is
about 36 inches wide and the croppings
show an excellent prospect, but it re
mains to be seen what will be the
character of the rock at the depth 'at
which' the tunnel will tap the vein.
This mine is situated on the lode be
tween the Poorman mine on the north
and the Jones mine on the south. In
the former rock has ' been found that
will run away up in the hundreds, but
the average is about $50 to the ton,
while in the latter the ore tias yielded
on an average of $37.50 to the ton. In
view of this fact it is but reasonable to
presume that pretty good rock ought
to exist in the Sampson at a reasonable
depth. '■). •'■•.' ■' " : ?/V5

OROVILLE TO VISALIA.
This Section Is Interestingly Described
For the "Ledger."
Fresno, Cal., May 25, 1900.
Editor Ledger:
Having recently passed over
the great central valley of California
from Orovillo in the northern citrus
belt, with its oranges and olives, to Vi
salia in the raisin belt, with its raisins
and jack rabbits, it might be fitting to
make some passing remarks.
Oroville, which is built on the dump
ing grounds of the early placer dig
gings, is nevertheless a well laid out
little city, with up-to-date business
houses and pretty homes. Every door
yard has its oranges or olives, the
former lying around like the apples do
in Amador. When the torn cats sere
nade the Orovilite, he reaches out the
window,- plucks an orange, and stops
the row with a well directed shot.
- The streets are well kept, and
sprinkled, during the summer months.
Although Oroville is not so large a
city as Sutter Creek, it has a good
high school with two instructors, and
supported by a tax rate of losb than
twenty cents on the one hundred dol
lars. In fact the rate this . year is
fifteen cents. As I visited the various
departments of this school and saw
thirty or forty young people getting
the benefits of a high school education,
my heart bled for the young people of
my own county, who are locked in a
castle whose door is guarded by a giant
in the shape of a few so-called leading
men who can and will control the voters
on any question that does not put
money into their own pockets. I hope
the voters of Amador county will wake
up in time to give their children just as
good an education as can be had any
where in this golden State, i,
From Oroville to Marysviile the
country is chiefly devoted to the olive,
which grows here as if in its proper
soil. Palermo and Honcut are growing
villages, each remarkable for its beauti
ful brick school buildings and general
air of up-to-date progress! veness.
Yuba City with its cherries and vast
peach orchards is a veritable paradise.
Leaving the fruit belt as we ap
proach Woodland, we enter a section
so well known that detailed mention is
not necessary. I refer to the great
wheat region of the San Joaquin Valley.
But as we begin to draw near Fresno
a change of scene (as well as of temper
ature) takes place, and the golden
brown of the wheat fields gives place
to the bright green of the celebrated
Fresno vineyards. For miles and miles
as you ride along your eye is rested,
after the glare of the wheat fields, by
the delicious green tint of the grape
vine. The rows are laid out in one
main direction, about eight feet apart,
the cross rows being more or less irreg
ular. On the trip I took to Pollasky
recently a I rode ten miles and over with
vineyards on both sides of the track as
far as the eye could roach.
Visalia, which lies about fifty miles
south, of Fresno, is, a model town, Quo
is impressed at once with its general air
of prosperity and the cleanliness of its
streets. Although not much larger
than some of our Amador county towns
the city is now talking of voting bonds
to build a high school building at a cost
of $21,800. 1 This shows the spirit of the
people. .'. ..:""-.. 0
It would be hard to say whether oil
wells or ;: Belgian hares are attracting
most attention in this part of the state.
Indeed both are being pretty well " dis
cussed. ) t |^ --7."i AM
With these few ' 'passing remarks"
I shall leave you with the final remark
that the more I see of the educational
progress in the various towns I visit,
the more I feel that; we of Amador
county should rise and shake ourselves,
lest, like old Atlas, we might find oaks
grown between our toes. Ulysses.

Over The Grade.
- John Steiner, owner of the Plymouth
stage line, had quite an . exciting ex
perience on Tuesday of this week. He
and another gentleman drove to Pa
lpma, and on their return, near Em
merson's place, while passing a freight
team, one of his horses nearest the
grade got down or laid down and the
only way to prevent the other horse
and buggy from going over the grade
was to strip the harness off and let the
horse go over, which was done in short
order, the horse going down back
wards Tor a distance of nearly a
hundred feet. Tho animal slid down
in such a manner that barring a few
scratches no injury was sustained.
Considerable difficulty was experienced,
however, in getting him on the grade
A False Alarm.
Another false alarm . was turned in
from the - box opposite Chapman's
saloon on Water street, about 1 o'clock
last Sunday morning. Some, one, evi
dently a little the worse for "booze, ' '
had broken the glass , and pressed the
button. Only a few of the fire depart
ment responded, and even thoso who
did,- didn't take the hose-cart out of
the shed. '■':''■. .'-'X'.'.'^-i
After waiting and watching a few
minutes and not seeing any fire from
Court House bill, it was decided there
was no fire and shortly after all was
quiet again.
This shows us the moral of the
"shephard boy and the wolves," very
forcibly, . and may sometime cause a
costly conflagration, all through a lack
of confidence In the fire alarm.

A Cool . Head.
Vergilia Squalletti is a hero in the
true sense of the term. Last Wednes
day morning between five and .six
o'clock in the East shaft .of the Ken
nedy, he, with three other miners of
the shift, had just finished putting in
nine blasts of giant powder, tho box of
priming powder being close at hand,
when in some unaccountable manner, a
mystery as yet, a lighted lamp or can
dle came tumbling down the shaft and
fell Into the box of priming powder.
In another moment it would have ex
ploded and no doubt the detonation
would have sent off the nine blasts and
four men would have been blown to
klngdomcome. But . Squalletti has a
cool head and an iron nerve and in a
jiffy he grabbed the box of power and
threw it outside the danger line and by
so doing sustained a serious burn- on
his hands and side of face. Dr. Gall
was summoned and alleviated the pain
and he is getting along all right. It is
of course problematical what the re
sult would have been if Squalletti had
not acted promptly, but the chances
are that a terrible accident would have
occurred.
The Candle Went Out.
Doubtless if the candle had perform
ed its part properly, the South Spring
Hill mill would have been in ashes to

A few days ago the watchman of the
mill found a suspicious affair back of
one of the batteries of the mill. It
consisted of a bunch of pitch pine
splinters in the center of which was a
tallow candle partly burned. A piece
of tin was used as a band to hold the
splinters about the candle, and an old
shirt was wound around the whole
concern. On either side of the infernal
machine was a bottle filled with coal
oil. The intention, no doubt, was. to
light the candle at the proper time so
that the conflagration would occur
when the watchman was off duty, and
by the time the blaze was discovered
it would be too late to cope with it suc
cessfully, and the mill would thus bo
totally destroyed. Our informant did
not know whether or not suspicion had
been fastened upon anyone.

Citizens, Attention!
It is nearing.the date upon which
1 that esteemed order, Native Daughters
of the Golden Went, will, hold their
Grand Lodge in Jackson: Are we pre
pared to give the many delegates a
hearty welcome?
The Ledger suggests that the busi
ness men of Jackson clean the streets
and appropriately decorate their re
spective residents and places of busi
ness. Let us harvest the crops grow
ing upon the house-tops, especially in
the business blocks on Main street, and
repair the side- walks.
Let us make that great assemblage
feel that we appreciate its choice of tha'
meeting place of the Grand Lodge of
1900, and may the delegates return to
their respective homes with glowing
words of praise of the grand reception
they received in Amador county. Let
us all strive to make their short stay
with us cheerful and pleasant and add
to their entertainment as much as
possible.
Accidentally . Shot Himself. *
: About 5 o'clock last Monday evening
Henry Ehler, aged about 15, and his
brother older, returned in a rig from a
hunting trip and stopped in front of
Wm. Daugherty's house on Pitt street.
Mrs. Daugherty is their sister and they
reside with her. The oldest boy got
out of the wagon and Henry was back
ing the horse around when a 22 rifle
which he was holding between hie legs
was discharged the bullet entering his
right side just above the ninth rib
passing around and upward and lodging
under the shoulder blade at the back.
Dr. Gall was called, but owing to the
weakened condition of the patient did
not extract the bullet, but says it can
bo taken out at any time. He says the
wound is not dangerous . unless blood
poisoning should ensue. It is not
known whether the gun was cocked at
the time or whether ' the hammer
struck the wagon bed with sufficient
force to explode the cartridge. It
should be the first care of those, old or
young, who return from hunting ex
cursions to pull the cartridge as soon
as they leave the game district. If
this precaution were taken many acci
dental shootings would'be avoided.
M. E. Fienic.
One of the most successful and enjoy
able picnics ever held in Jackson by a
Sunday School was enjoyed by the M.
E. Sunday School last Saturday. The
little folks are very grateful to Rev.
and Mrs. F. A. Morrow and their esti
mable daughter and others who assist
ed them, for a day of unalloyed happi
ness. The weather was propitious and
the fun continuous and button burst*
ing. The baseball game has never
been equaled on the face of the earth.
Nine young ladies and nine young men
did the playing and Sheriff U. S.
Gregory acted as umpire. The sheriff
was armed to the teeth and when he
gave a decision he enforced it at the
point of the bayonet. It is needless to
say that the ladies won the game.
The racing by the little folks, big
folks, lean folks and fat folks, was
catching and laughter provoking.
Twenty-five dollars in cash prizes were
distributed to the victorious ones. W,
T. Cam, the candy manufacturer, fur
nished the money for expenses and
took the profits of the day.
Cain's Big Toe.
On Friday morning of last week, while
busily at work preparing for the picnic
to take place the following day, W. T.
Cain had the misfortune to drop an ice
cream freezer on to the great toe of his
left foot, breaking the bone and mash
ing it flat. Dr. Gall fixed it up for him
and the next day he was on duty at
the picnic by the aid of crutches, and
personally looked after his interests
there in spite' of the pain. Cain has
the pluck that will win wherever you
put him. Nine men out of ten under
like circumstances would have staid at
home and sat in a rocking chair having
the injured foot either on a pillow in
another chair or in his wife's lap.^
A Business Visit.
Charles H. Shinn, superintendent of
agriculture of the University of Cali
fornia, arrived in Jackson from Berke
ley on his bicycle Monday evening and
visited the Experiment Station near
here, Tuesday morning, returning to
Jackson in the afternoon. Later in
the evening he left for Sutter Creek
and from there to lone.
Mr. Shinn spoke highly of Mr. Neil's
work at the Experiment Station, and
was very well pleased with the general
appearance of the Station.
Gave a Party.
Miss Hazel Quirolo gave a birthday
party last Friday afternoon at her
home on Pitt street, it being her ninth
birthday. Miss Quirolo handsomely
entertained a number of her young lady

"The recent escape from the, parish
prison," said a secondhand bookseller
en tbe old - side who has almost as
many reminiscences as he has vol
umes, "reminds me of a very curious
case of Jail delivery In which I was
an accessory before the fact 1 1 was
. never . arrested for It, but don't ob
ject to telling you the story, j I
"One day in the summer, of j 1895 a
good looking, well dressed man strolled
into the shop and said he wanted to
get something that would interest his
old mother, whom he described as very
religious and fond of antique books.
"We picked out a dozen or so togeth
er, Fox's 'Book of Martyrs,' 'Pilgrim's
Progress,' Mather's 'Sermons of Occa
sion,', Pusey's 'Daniel the Prophet' and
among others a ' quaint, ; massively
bound volume , called ..'The . Friend •In
Affliction.' They were all interesting
old copies, but my caller told jme he
would like to submit them to his moth
er before closing the purchase and of
fered to leave a $50 bill as security.
"That was agreeable to me, and he
carried away the lot. Next day. he re
turned and brought back three or four
of the books, among them 'The FrJ/>nd
In Affliction,' which he remarked laugh
ingly had given his mother the, blues.
The others he paid for, and. l have nev
er seen him again from that day' to
.this. ,,.,.;, j . .
"Almost a week after his visit, how
ever, a thin, prim, precise, elderly lady,
a typical spinster from head ,to . toe,
"vame in one afternoon and began look
ing over the shelves. Presently she
.ran across the same old 'Friend. ln Af
fliction' that had fared so badly, in the
other trade, and, much to my 'gratifi
cation, she purchased it on the spot
It was exactly the thing, she. said, to
give consolation to an unfortunate per
son of her acquaintance who was then
In great trouble. I was glad to get rid
of the book and let her have it for a
couple of dollars. .. •■•- ;.'. :-■-.-. 1 -■ •

what I knew about it • ■ ■ ■
.. "The book had suffered since I saw it
last One of its thick covers was rip
ped open, and sticking inside ,waa a
small steel file. The story the detective
told me was certainly extraordinary.
. ; "It seems that a noted northern crook
had been in jail in a small town: up the
country on a charge of bank burglary
and being a very smooth rascal had en
listed the sympathy of a philanthropic
old lady of the place who had, a fad
- for prison reform. He persuaded . her
that he had thoroughly repented, and
she used to visit him I regularly and
bring him tracts and delicacies., i
| "Among other things he told her that
while broke in New Orleans he had
sold all of his belongings, including a
keepsake from his mother— a volume
called The Friend In Affliction.' He
gave her my address as the; place
where -he had left the precious relic
and worked on her feelings to such an
extent that she promised to secure the
book for him tbe first time she visited
the city. . . . . . . : j ;
"How she discovered and purchased
it you already know. On her return she
carried it straight to the Jail, and while
ordinarily all gifts for -prisoners were
closely examined, this lady's high char
acter made such precaution seem un
necessary and she passed in the volume
without question. i; i o ■
■ "A few days later the turnkey, found
a barred window'neatly sawed and the
bird flown. He also found 'The Friend
In Affliction' lying on the floor, and In
one of the massive covers were several
saws and the file I have mentioned.
Of ! course the philanthropic old lady
was immediately questioned, and her'
.hysterical replies led to the visit of the
detective, but nothing ever came' of the

EAGLES AND THEIR PREY.
A Glaat Bird Whose Race Has Hap-
pily Become Extinct.
pi There is at the j present moment at
the Natural History museum a model
of the skull of an eagle so gigantic that
the imagination can scarcely fit it into
the life of this planet at all. | ■
' The whole head is larger than that of
an ox,' and the beak resembles a pair
of hydraulic shears. Unlike most of
the giant beasts, this eagle, which in
habited Patagonia, appears from its
remains ito have differed little from
the . existing species. Its size; alone
distinguishes It The quills of the
feathers which bore this awful raptor
through the air must have been as
thick as a walking stick and the webs
as wide as car blades. It would have
killed and torn to pieces creatures as
I large as a bison and whirled up into
the sky and dropped Into i the | rocks
the gigantic j carapaced animals of
; prehistoric Patagonia as easily as a
modern eagle of California does the
land tortoise on which it feeds. , t£<
Even today there are few carnivo
rous animals, whether birds or beasts,
which have so wide a range of. prey
as the eagles. Like the kinged drag
ons of old story, they can ravage
earth, air and sea and feed promiscu
ously on the denizens of all three ele
ments. From serpents on the burning
desert to seals on the everlasting ice,
from monkeys in the tropical forests
to marmots on tbe Alpine slopes, from
dead sheep on highland hills to pea
cocks in the Indian jungles, no form of
fish, flesh or fowl comes amiss to them,
and the young eagle, driven by the in
exorable law of his race from the home
where he was reared, finds a free
breakfast table wherever he flies.—

WILES OF THE FOX.
Some Clever Tricks by 'Which Rey-
nard Baffles His Pursuers.
A fox is entitled to all that is said
for its wisdom and sagacity. Not long
ago the Washington hunt of Valley
Forge started a young fox in the North
valley hills, and the hounds were run
ning It across the open field when the
hunters were surprised to see a much
larger fox come from the woods and
run diagonally across the track of the
young fox ahead the hounds, , and
when they struck the stronger track
of the bigger fox they took It up, young
Reynard thereby being saved from be
ing run down and killed by the hounds.
Old hunters say they have frequently
witnessed this trick when young foxes
were being closely pressed and in dan
ger of being run down and killed by
the hounds. Another and an even
sharper trick was played by an old fox
some weeks ago while being" hotly
chased by. hounds. The fox had run
some 20 miles, and while crossing an
open stretch of country was in danger
of being run down and killed. In a
field through which the fox was run
ning with the hounds close to its' heels
was the cellar of an old bouse, with a
portion of the walls still standing. The
fox . made straight for the old cellar,
leaped Into it and made Its escape
through a narrow opening in the walls.
The hounds, supposing the fox was
trapped, dashed into the cellar pell
mell, only to find Reynard gone j and
themselves In a trap, as tbe hole In the
wall through which the fox had es
caped was too small to permit them to
get through. * ; ;.;.
, When the hunters rode up, they
found the pack in a trap, with. one of
the hounds wedged fast In the hole
through which the fox had made its
escape. By the time the hounds were
got out of the cellar the fox was safe
In Its hole.— Philadelphia Times.
Tbe Bullet and the Mark.
"General Lawton," said an j officer
who served with that fearless com
mander, "once said to me that the
right . bullet would always find its
mark no matter how small the latter
might be, and then he related an inci
dent which occurred during the civil
war. In one of the engagements of
his command— l can't remember now
whether or not he mentioned the place
—a piece of shell hit the ground near
where a soldier was standing and
scared him so badly that be Jumped
straight up in the air like a rabbit. As
he did so a mlnie ball knocked off tbe
crown of his head. . ,■■
- " 'That was the one particular bullet
intended !to kill- him,' said General
Lawton, 'and he actually bad to jump
after if :.; ;

seriousness in his voice, and I inferred

wound himself up to the proper pitch,

Aldrlch, who was sitting near him,
and asked: "Imagine! What; would
you do if you were to meet a canni
bal?" i
"I think," Mr. Aldrich sweetly re
plied, "that I should stop to pick an
acquaintance with him."

THE JUDGE'S ADVICE/
Given to a Man Who Wavered Be-
tween Religion and Politics.
A well known western representa
tive in cttugress, pleading an engage
ment, left a small group of talkers In
an up town hotel lobby, and an elderly
man, whom he had introduced to the
party, made bold to tell a story about
the departed. - .
"I have known him," he said,. "ever
tince he was a boy, and when he came
Dut of college he was undecided wheth
er to become a lawyer and politician or
go to a theological seminary and be-,
come a clergyman. He was fond of
politics and thought that with a little
law and more religion on the side he
might become a great moral reformer.

roung men feel when they undertake
politics for the first time. i-■'.i -■'.. ';'
■■■ "However, before he had had time to
determine finally . what, he would do,
his friends came after him to run for
the legislature, j as he had j the availa
bility and a pretty fair amount of cash.
This brought hini face to face with
the question he had • been j much • dis
turbed over, and he went^ to; Judge
Blank, a. veteran in politics and a man
of the highest character, for assistance
in solving the problem. He stated. bis
case in full to the judge, and the grand
old man : put his hand on the young
man's shoulder. - ■. • •
i " 'My, boy,' he said; as only he could
say it, 'it can't be politics and religion.
It must be one or the other. You can't
fit yourself for heaven and for the leg
islature at the same time, and there's
no use trying. That Is all I can say,
and you will have to make your own
choice.'"— Washington Star.
A KAFFIR SMOKER.
The Native Women Are Enthnilastle
Devotees of the Weed.
;In South ; Africa the native women
smoke Incessantly. Your native serv
nnt smokes as. she cooks and as she
washes. The tobacco she likes is rank.
The dainty cigarette an. English or
Russian lady of fashion enjoys, smoked
through a quill so that no nicotine can
stain either, teeth or fingers,' would be
sneered at by, a Kaffir. "Give me a
pipe and something In it j I can taste."
is in effect what she says.
The men Kaffirs are beyond tobacco.
They smoke something so vehement
that it makes them cough. and splutter,
lose their breath, choke and sneeze to
an alarming degree. , They like snuff,
too, and are fond of offering and taking
pinches of it ("schniff" they call it)
when they meet and visit one another.
Regarding tobacco as I too mild for
their taste, the Kaffirs take another
weed and smoke that. § They proceed
to arrange a smoking party by squat
ting on the ground and getting ready
their "pipe," a cow horn with; a thin
tube In it Inserted half way down at
right angles to: the horn. The end of
the tube Is in a basin, and it is from It
that the smoker sucks the strong stuff
that makes him Incapable of anything
but a series of coughs and chokes for
some time after he has had his turn at
the pipe, which is passed round f rotn
man to man until a perfect chorus of
coughs rends the air;;
The tobacco the Boers smoke looks
like poor tea and is peculiar In , flavor,
yet Englishmen who have become used
to It acquire such a taste for It that
they never ask for any other kind.—

Is Alaska Growing Warmer t

In the Klondike region may extract
some comfort from the discovery, made
by the Harrlman Alaska expedition,
that most of the glaciers which abound
In that territory- are receding. The
fact Is an. Indication that the average
weather there is growing warmer. If
It were growing colder the glaciers
would be advancing, while if It were
about the same one year .with another
they would maintain tbe same general
position, neither creeping nearer to the
pea nor melting away from their termi

WA STORYiOF, DAN RICE.
The Great Clown Did Hot Forffet tfce
Teat Han's Bill.
One etory of Dan Bice, the veteran
circus clown, illustrates his strict sense
of honesty and gratitude for f avow.
Once he was stranded in Cincinnati,
the story goes, and was unable to start
a show on tbe road because be had no
tent and could not raise money to buy
one.' ; The tent Bice; needed would be
worth $2,500. The manager of a ten*
concern sent for the clown one morn
ing and, taking him to his factory,
showed a big tent that waa jnet finish
ed. Bice looked at it with hungry eyeev
He' turned away, with a sigh. ;: .
"Fine .tent/ don't you think 7' asked
the canvas maker. ..-
Bice looked tack at it over his shoul
der, with another deep slghJ j \
"It's yours," said the tent man.
- Rice was like a playful kitten In an
Instant. \ '
"I believe there l\ a lot of money in
you yet," said the canvas man. .';Tou
take that tent and start your show,
and If you ever get money enough to
pay me for it the price Is $2,600. •
Within two weeks Bice was on the
road with a show and began a success
ful career. For 15 years he never, re
ferred: to the tent, although he often
met the man who made it. One after
noon he asked the tent man to' be his
guest at one of his shows, then in Cin
cinnati. The two sat looking on,' and
Bice remarked:
"Fine show, don't you think?"
j The canvas man declared that it cer
tainly was. j
"By the way," added Bice, "here's
that $2,500 I owe you." He took a roll
of bills out of his pocket and handed it
to the tentmaker.who pocketed It with
out unrolling it. The old tent man lov

THE BABY'S LITTLE JOKE..
It Worried the Fat Man, but He Tried
to Enjoy It.
It happened In 'one of the late trains.
Everybody was .trying to get to sleep,
and when the voice of a baby was Bud
denly lifted up in a robust wail It was
not met with expressions of joy. .. It
cried steadily from Spring Garden
street to . Columbia avenue. Then it
accidentally dropped a pasteboard box'
it had. A very stout and, like his kind,
very affable man across the aisle
stooped heavily and picked It up. fa
The child stopped crying ,as it took
It and promptly dropped it again. The
man, thinking it an accident, .' picked
it up once more. This time the baby
actually smiled, and as he threw it
down audibly cooed with delight. The
man looked . distinctly uncomfortable
and became interested In something
outside the window. The child looked
at the box a moment, then at the man,
and, seeing nothing else, resumed his
wail, with much added wind. The
