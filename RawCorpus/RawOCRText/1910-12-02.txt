PRISONERS
GET HEARING
Men Accused of Murder
Taken to Drytown
and Examined
Sheriff Gregory and Frank Sangui
netti, the latter as a deputy, took
Giacomo Sampo, George Sampo, his
brother, and Stefano Conti, for a pre
liminary hearing before Justice Blow
er at Drytown on a charge of murder
ing Stefano Pistone of that town.
P. Farico, an uncle of Pistone, testi
fied that the deceased had been in the
country about one year, and that he
met his death some time on the night
of November 20th.
Miss Eva Cavallero, a daughter of
the proprietor of the boarding house
in which the fracas took place, said she
was dancing with Stefano Pistone
when Giacomo Sampo came in and
started to abuse her. Mrs Cavallero,
informed the big miner that he must
keep orderly or get out.
This angered Giacomo, who deliber
ately punched Fistone, and then struck
the landlady over the head with a
chair.
Dr. E. E. Endicott testified that at
the autopsy, which he held assisted by
Dr. A. P. Griffin, he found a number
of blood clots pressing on the brain.
He said the skull was also badly frac
tured on the same side.
The fracture in the opinion of the
doctor, was caused by a blunt instru
ment, and death was due to cerebral
hemorrhage.
George Callandri, who resides near
where the trouble occurred, testified
as an eye, witness of the fight. He
told of the deceased's plea for mercy,
and said that while Conti held Pistone,
Sampo beat him over the head with a
rock.
After hearing other witnesses, the
justice bound the three prisoners to
answer without bail. Giacomo Sampo
and Stefano were held as murderers of
Pistone, and George Sampo was held
on a charge of attempt to . commit
murder upon Mrs Cavallero, wife oT
the proprietor of the place in which
the trouble started.

HIGH SCHOOL
MASS MEETING
Plans To Help Jackson
Secure the School
Discussed
A mass meeting of citizens was
called to order on Monday evening
last, for the purpose of discussing
ways and means whereby Jackson
could offset the efforts and struggles
waged by the citizens of Sutter Creek
for the selection of a certain location
for the county high school which has
been granted at the recent election.
The band assembled on the court
house steps at 7:30 p. m., and struck
up several selections which drew a
number of citizens into the vicinity
of the courthouse and when the meet
ing was culled to order at 8 p. m. by
George Brown, the superior court
room was well filled with the loading
citizens of Jackson.
Dr. J. F. Wilson was nominated
and elected temporary and permanent
chairman of the organization, which
was being established, and Jas. J.
Wright was elected as the secretary.
' After the meeting was organized,
Richard Webb suggested that a Union
high school be considered with a view
of passing up the county high school
proposition, advancing as his reasons
for the suggestion, the fact that in
that manner of procedure the town
would positively be assured of such an
institution of learning:, whereas, if a
contest be waged oetween the two
towns which are now antagonistic, it
would mean bitter hostility, and in the
event of Sutter Creek securing the
location, Jackson would suffer the in
convenience of sending her scholars to
that town, and be compelled as well
to pay a tax that would materially not
benefit the city property one dollar.
He then suggested that a committee
on the general question of whether a
county or union district is advisable
for Jackson under the circumstances,
and particularly to look into the legal
aspect of- the matter, touching the
question of whether or not the people
of Jackson district could be held for
the support of the county high school
as well:
Ernest Spagnoli, C. W. Caldwell,
Dr. Schacht, Dr. Gall, Dr. Endicott
were appointed on the committee
which nad a stormy debate as to the
general duties which it was to per
form. A motion was then made by C.
P. Vicini to appoint permanent com
mittee of eleven on ways and means to
select a temporary and permanent
location for the proposed high school.
The committee named are :
Geo. W. Brown, Dr. E. E. Endi
cott, Wm. F. Detert, Benj. F. Tay
lor, Dr. A. M. Gall, Alfonse Ginoc
chio, Chas. F. Culbert, Mrs C. P.
Vicini, Mrs E. E. Endiott, Mrs B. F.
Taylor, Mrs Chris Marelia.
The chairman then asked for some
suggestion as to a name which might
be given the organization just formed.
Among other suggestions the name
of "Mutual High School Club of Jack
son" was suggested and adopted by a
unanimous vote.
It was then carried by vote that the
committee appointed meet every Mon
day evening to discuss plans of pro
cedure in carrying on the campaign
for securing the site of the proposed
high school in the city of Jackson.
Dr. E. Endicott then made a motion
which was carried appointing a per
manent committee on order of busi
ness and by laws, consisting of three
members. Those appointed were Dr.
Schacht, . R. I. Kerr and Chas. P.
Vicini. No further business to trans
act, the meeting adjourned.

THE DELUCCHI
ASSAULT CASE
Jurors Drawn, and Trial
Is Progressing
Rapidly
The trial ot John Dclucchi. charged
with assault with a deadly weapon
with intent to murder Manuel Lopaz
in Amador City on the 29th of August
last, wu commenced in the superior
court on Monday last. The district at
torney represented the prosecution,
and Joseph Frick of Oakland appeared
as counsel for the defendant. W.
Dudcn of Sacramento was the official
reporter.
It was in the afternoon of Tuesday
that the jury of twelve was compelled,
the entire panel of 40 names being ex
hausted with the exception of two or
three names before the full list of
jurymen, acceptable to both sides, was
secured. The number of peremptory
challenges was exhausted by both pro
secution and defendants. The jurymen
sworn to try the case was as follows :
George Murphy, F. B. Joyce, W. H.
Prouty, Jerome Guisto, E» Merkel,
Ben Isaacs, J. H. Heffren, H. Toop,
S. W.Jones, T. Lema, Peter Labo
die, Wm. J. Nettle, jr.
The jurors were subjected to as
keen and searching an examination
touching their qualifications by the at
torney for the defense as was even
witnessed in the courts of Amador
county.
The first witness was Manuel Lopez,
the complainant. He testified that of
on the 29th of August last, in going
toward the store of Chichizola he met
the defendant near the corner of the
Amador hotel ; both were on the side
walk. Defendant talked first and said,
"you— -i - , you no give me $10 for
job." Defendant punched him back
with his fist, and he slapped him on
the face and knocked him down. J.
M. ColFman came out of the hotel, and
kicked him on the left side. There
after defendant and Coffman went into
the hotel. Witness went' across the
street toward the livery stable, and
went he got 40 feet or so from the
hotel, some one " called out : "Look
out, the man has got a pistol." He
turned round, and defendant drew a
pistol, calling him a bad name, and
saying, "I fight you now." tie
caught hold of the pistol with both
hands, and struggled for twenty
minutes before he could take it away
from him. The hammer came down
on his finger during this struggle, the
mark caused thereby could be seen at
present time. Defendant was striking
him in the face with one hand, and
also trying to bite him while the trissle
was in progress. He bit him over the
chin. After taking the pistol away
he turned partly round and handed it,
with the butt end, to a bystander.
In cross examination he said he was
now living in Jamestown, before that
he worked at Campo Seco ; before that
he was in Amador City for six months.
He was a miner; worked at the
Original Amador mine 13 days, under
Delucchi, defendant, who was shift
boss. He left on the 27th of August,
and was laid off on the 29th, the day
of the trouble. The fight with De
lucchi took place between 4 and 5
o'clock in the afternoon. The pistol
was a 35 caliber 6 shooter, single ac
tion. It was loaded with 5 cartridges
at the time. Defendant in scuffle, said
"Leave me have my pistol, I want to
kill you,' 1 and repeated it about 25
times. Witness said nothing, but was
working to get the weapon. After the
pistol was taken from him, defendant
picked up, a rock. Coffman took a
pistol out of his own pocket at this
time and said, "Do you see that?"
Witness took the rock away from de
fendant also. Never had any trouble
with defendant before, never inquired
for him at the hotel on that day; did
not look for him at the mine; did not
in-iulge in threats to any one concern
ing him. Did not offer to fix it for
$100.
He said the reason he quit work was
that two days before the 27th he laid
utf for two shifts, on the morning of
the 29th he told Delucchi that he
would be at work that night. De
lucchi told him he had another man in
his place. Still he showed up for
work that night, and was sent to work
in the 500 level, on that occasion was
called bad names by defendant and
quit finally. Never was friendly with
Delucchi and telt mad toward him at
present.
J. M. Fancher testified to recieving
the pistol from Lopez, after the later
had wrested it from the hands of De
lucchi.
John Hosklns testified that he saw
the men in a fight ont he porch of the
Amador hotel. Both men were on the
floor of the porch when he saw them,
and CofTman appeared and made a
kick. All three were on the porch at
this time. Delucchi had hold of the
porch post, and kicked, saw Lopez
grab at his foot at this time.
A uumber of other minor witnesses
were examined. The prosection will
finish to-day. The case is not likely to
80 to the jury until next week.
Church Repaired
The Methodist church has received a
new roof and other necessary exterior
repairs needed in preserving the in
terior of the structure from further
delapidation. The church was ne
glected and allowed to run down in a
most shameful manner. Strips of wall
paper on the ceiling were loosened and
dangled from the center, ready to drop
at any time. This has all been tem
porary repaired and permanent repairs
to the interior will be forthcoming as
soon as sufficient funds can be raised
to warrant the undertaking of the
work.
Rev. Duncan has thus far secured
subscriptions and cash amounting to
considerable over 8200. and this money
will all be used in paying for the ex
terior repairs, which will cost about
§500.
A new piano will also be installed in
the near future, and a collection of
$50 will be raised for the purchase of
LOCAL SHOW
VERY GOOD
Audience Well Pleased
With Performance
of Amateurs
The show given in Love's hall last
Saturday evening, by local talent,
entitled. "The Honor of a Cowboy,"
proved quite a hit, and was enjoyed
by a large audience.
While many in the cast were making
their debut before the footlights, we
can frankly say the play was well
carried throughout, and deserved all
the praise it received.
The plot was laid in the mountains
of Montana, and carried with it a
pretty love romance, a cowboy's
honor, and a death scene, which was
cleverly brought out by Zeph Dal
Porto, and Miss Mayme Scapuzzi.
L. J. Craddock took the part of a
frontier judge, and it was his happy
lot to fall deeply in love with a
beautiful widow, named Mrs Susan
Trevelyn, who belonged to New
York's exclusive set, and who was
visiting 1 at a summer resort in the
mountains. Miss Hilda Sanguinetti
took the role of the charming widow,
and although she is but a girl in her
teens, her personality and costume
were commented upon by many in the
audience. The judge won his prize
in the last act.
Wm. G. Snyder, was the sheriff
who loved to shoot h— out of things,
and his role as sheriff Jenkins, was
as well tilled in the love scene, as it
was i.i his capturing the den of rob
bers. Miss Inez Tarn, as Lucy Arbuckle
was captivated by the sheriff's brave
acts and his pretty features, and the
last act also wound up with their
nuptials.
Roy B. Skelley, as Missouri Smith,
played his part exceptionally good.
His character as a German American,
brought fourth much laughter and
mirth.
Wm. Penry had a good makeup,
and acted his part very efficiently.
Wm. Schroeder as Jim Selby, was
probably, the most typical cowpuncher
that ever acted on that platform. He
had a long interesting part, and his
costume was perfect. Bob Kerr was
heap tire water man, named Scar Face,
and played his part very well.
George Kirby, Frank Fuller and
Chas. Cademartori were other charac
ters, who helped fill in the cast, which
was played without a hitch of any
kind.
During the acts, Eda Dal Porto sang
a Spanish Serenade and, Billie Endi
cott played a duet from "Lucia."
Both were ably rendered and enjoyed.
The proceeds of the entertainment
will be used by the local band for im
provements in personal property.

Treasurer
The Treasurer mine will soon be one
of the leading industries along the
lode if prospects continue, as are the
present showings. The shaft is nearly
seven hundred feet deep and drifts are
cut at various sections along the ledge
which is claimed to be of extra good
grade rock. Improvements are beinjr.
made on the surface and all present
indications point to a bright future for
the mine. A. E. McCurdy is in charge
of the plant, and ranks high in the es

ing is concerned.
Bunker Hill
The Bunker Hill is fast completing
her new 20 stamp mill, which when
completed, will give that mine 40
stamps dropping on a good pay-rock.
The mine has had a very encouraging
year of prospecting, and sufficient ore
is in sight to run the 40-stamps at
their full capacity for an indentiite
period. Work is improving the shaft
is also pursued at favorable times,
and it is expected to be fully prepared
to handle all the ore required, by the
time the new mill is ready to com
mence operations.
Very Important
Meeting Tomorrow
A meeting of the Ladies' Improve

THE CITY BUSINESS STREET.
During the past week scores of loads of mud have been
scraped from Main street, Jacksou, and hauled away. This
represents the accumulation caused by the wear and tear of
traffic on this thoroughfare for a period of a few mouths in a
distance of about 1200 linear feet of the roadway. To
replace this worn-out road material, the street is being re
topped with a thin coating of broken rock hauled from the
dump pile of the Anita mme — the main source of supply for
material for street repair work in this city for several years
past. This present coating consists not of clean rock of uni
form size crushed specially for that purpose, but of the finer
stuff sorted by human labor from the dump, and mixed with
considerable finer slaty material which is practically worth
less for such use. Now this hauling on and hauling off is
a very costy process when repeated, as it has been for many
years past, at intervals of every few months. The city rock
breaker, if it ever reaches an active working basis, offers no
solution for this trouble, at any rate with the material avail
able, and probably not with any rock material in existence.
It may answer for other city streets, where the traffic is not
one tithe that of Main street, where a 'coating of this kind
of macadam might continue serviceable for years. It is about
time to look around for some more lasting method of fixing
Main street. We admit that every form of road-building is
subject to wear; it will require repairing to keep it in good
condition. But surely a system that fails to get a business
street free from slush and mud after any winter shower is a
good one to be discarded. Furthermore, it a very expensive
one. If the money that has beeu spent on Main street in the
last few years in the endless and wholly unsatisfactory on
and-off routine had been expended en a more approved and
up-to-date system, we would no doubt have been far along
toward possessing a creditable business street. We are a
long way from having such now, and it is safe to say we
never will see much improvement until there comes a radical
change in the mode of construction. Of course, with the
means at the command of the trustees the process of improve
ment must necessarily be gradual and extend over a period of
years. Admitting all this, there seems no adequate reason
why a beginning should not be made in this direction. Main
street furnishes a heavy percentage of the city revenue in
property taxes and licenses. With a guarantee of an im
proved street' the property holders and business men would
be willing to augment the ordinary funds by voluntary con
tributions according to frontage owned or occupied to bring
about this much needed reform.
COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL
By the vote of the electors on November 7th last, every
portion of Atnador county is now committed to the payment
o f a tax for the support of a high school. There is no escape
from this responsibility. The issue that confronts the people
to-day is, Where shall the county high school be located?
Jackson and Sutter Creek are contestants for this distinction.
Jackson is by far the most populous town, and would prob
ably command a larger attendance of pupils than any other
location. Sutter Creek is admittedly nearer the populous
and geographical center of the county than any other town,
and bases its claim for recognition as the proper site ou this
score. The contest between the two towns if pressed to a de
termination at the ballot box is big with promise of a hot
time in both towns, with a legacy of more or less bitterness
after the fight is over, no matter which way it goes. The
Ledger believes that the time has come for Jackson to organ
ize for a high school anyway, without awaiting the doubtful
issue of an election on the locatiou of the county high school.
A school in Sutter Creek would not meet the educational re
quiremeuts of Jackson one whit better than the present high
school in lone, and vice versa with regard to Sutter Creek
and the country tiibutary thereto. It has been decided by
the superior court of Calaveras county that the establishment
of a county high school is nc bar to the creation of union
distiicts thereafter, and that districts so undertaking the sup
port of a school of their own are exempt from the county
high school tax. Is it not the better plan for Jackson, befo:e
incurring any moral obligation by a contested election, to
move for a home high school. The maintenance will involve
a somewhat Heavier tax, but to offset this we shall have the
certainty of securing needed educational facilities for this
part of the county.

led to the discovery of Neptune in
1846. Comets may have their orbits
changed by the attraction of unknown
bodies or may be accelerated or re
tarded in their movements. Prof.
Fenton has noted disturbances of the
movements and aphelion position of
certain comets, and has decided that
there is a yet undiscovered planet,
which must be about 105 times as far
away from the sun as the earth, and
more than three times as far as Nep
tune. Unexplained disturbances of
the outer planets observed by Prof.
Todd, the American astronomer, have
given curiously similar results. Still
more striking confirmation of the view
or Prof. Fenton is pointed out in the
investigation by Cowell and Crommel
in Halley's Comet, which, after being
75 years, brought back information of
some retarding influence that delayed
the perihelion passage by two . days.
The assumed position of the hypothe
tical planet was just right to explain
this retarding.
The new serum test for blood
brought into a recent criminal trial in
England is based on the curious fact
that serum from a rabbit or mouse in
to which human serum has been in
lected gives a precipitate with human
serum, but not with that of the blood
of other animals. When first tried in
a French court, about five years ago,
the test disproved the prisoner's state
ment that a certain stain was rabbit's
blood.
In a recent English medical exhibi
tion, moving pictures were -shown of
sleeping sickness in a rat, various or
ganisms in the blood of rats and [ mice,
the life-history of the Mexican axolotl
from the first movement of the embryo
in the egg, and an ex-ray examination
of an ulcerated stomach.
In what seems to be its most pro
mising form, the new "stellite" of
Elwood Hayes contains about 75 per
cent of cobalt and 25 per cent of chro
mium. In strength and elasticity it is
claimed to equal good steel, it is non
magnetic, takes a high polish and has
extraordinary resistance to tarnishing,
and is very hard, yet not only forges
readily at red heat bat even in cast
ings—if not too thick — it can be bent
cold to a right angle. In color it is
between silver and steel. It takes a
fine cutting edge— a razor used two
years having proven nearly equal to
one of steel— and is believed to furnish
a superior metal for pocket and table
knives and other small cutlery, for
surgical, chemical and physical uten
sils. Experiments have shown that
the alloy can be greatly varied by
changing the proportions of the con
stituents or by adding small amounts
of other substances. Non-oxidizable
modifications so soft as to be easily
filed have been produced, and others
have been made bo hard as readily to
scratch glass and even quartz, the
hardest being ratner brittle. A mix
ture of cobalt and chromium with as
much as 20 per cent of platinum was
found to resist chemical action much
less than the alloy with no platinum.
Power stations that do not exhaust
t'leir fuel supply have been considered
in the peat-using plans of Frank and
Caro, German chemists. By their pro
cess, peat containing as much as 60 per
cent of water can be used on a com
mercial scale, and power-gas yielding
up to 900 horse per hours per long ton
of dried peat substance can be ob
tained the nitrogen up to 85 per cent
being utilized as ammonium sulphate.
A 4,000 horse-power station is now
supplying power to Oambruck from
the peat of Dammer Moor, Hanover.
The fuel material to a depth of 10 feet
is removed each year from 40 acres,
and - 800 acres of moorland are ex
pected to give this station a permanent
supply, as it is believed the peat can
be renewed in 20 years.
The refracting telescope of the
Treptow observatory, near Berlin, has
the great length of 70 feet, with an
object glass of 27 inches in diameter.
The equatorial of the YerKes Obser
vatory, Lake Geneva, Wis., is but 62
feet long, but its 40-inch lens makes
it the largest and most powerful re
fractor in the world.
Cloth has been made from the banana
fiber in experiments in China, and the
new textile is expected to come into
use for summer clothing. Stalks about
a year old are used, These are softened
by steaming over boiling water, their
green outer skin Is removed by pas
sing through a machine having two
blunt scrapers, nnd the fibers ore freed
from moisture and made less adherent
by being wrapped in a cloth and
pounded with a hammer, after which
they are pulled apart and spun into
threads for weaving. The process is
quite similar to that used for separat
ing ramie fibers. The ultimate fiber
of the banana are nbout 15 inches long
and very strong, and the pale yellow
cloth is exceedingly tough and pro
mises to be very durable. Made in
yard-wide rolls five yards long, the
small amount of the cloth so far
made has been sold at about $1.25
per yard. A sample was shown at a
recent fair near Peking, and has
been secured and forwarded to Eng
land.
In preparing flour from sugar
beets, at the establishment of Al
phonse Huillard, a French manu
facturer, the roots are first chopped,
and most of the 72 per cent of water
is removed by evaporation in a
special dryer. From 357 pounds of
fresh roots 100 pounds of dry mater
ial is obtained. This 100 pounds con
tains more than 70 pounds of sugar
and about 82 pounds of nutritive sub
stance. The material is ground, with
suitable precautions, and supplies a
sweet flour that is a highly efficient
food, quite germ-free, and that has
great present and poapective useful
ness for cakes, sweet bread and other
products.
The tropics hold a vast but dimly
appreciated reserve of timber. From
his investigation of several years, Dr.
H. N. Whitford finds that thu timber
supply of the Philippine Islands is of
surprising richness as compared with
that cf the United States, the 25,000,
000 acres of virgin forest in the Is
lands containing 200,000,000,000 board
feet of lumber, while the 200,000,000
acres of forest reserves of the United
States have only 400,000,000,000 board
feet. That is, the Philippine forests
have four times as much wood per
acre as those of the temperate regions
of America.
Thanksgiving Sermon
At Episcopal Church
At St. Augustine's church last Sun
day evening, Rev. Shea prefaced his
sermon from the text "And Elijah
came unto all the people and said. How
long halt ye between two opinions; if
the Lord be God, follow him, but if
Baal, then follow him. But the
people answered not a word." That
thanksgiving is an institution peculiar
to the church, and that while one day
is set apart every year for special
thanksgiving, still we must not over
look the fact that every service of the
church- morning and evening prayers,
and especially the service of the altar—
the sacrifice of the mass, the encharis
tic sacrifice, holy communion, or what
ever else you may choose to call it
contains a leading note of thanks
giving. Any service to God void of
this great essential feature, expresses
a wrong interpretation of man's true
relationship to God. Thanksgiving and
advent most fittingly come together,
as they are co-relative in their teach
ing. Both should be an inspiration
for us to look backward over the
past year, to seriously consider the
blessings received, and our ingratitude
to the giver of all good. Both are an
incentive anJ an exortation to prepare
fittingly for the future. But the season
of advent, I am sorry to say, is little
known, so at best not recognized by
many professing Christian bodies to
day. Even thanksgiving itself has
degenerated into a mere ceremonial
observance, in which a heart-touch
gratification of the senses predomi
nates.
Baby won't suffer five minutes with
croup if you apply Dr. Thomas'
Eclectic Oil at once. It acts like
magic.
Victim of Drug Habit
Although reputed to be worth
about 8160,000. Richard Haile, a for
mer brilliant attorney of Dixon, and
one of the leading citiaens of the com
munity a few years ago, is now dying
in San Francisco hospital, after hav
ing been given up as a hopeless case
by the authorities of Suisun through
his addiction to the drug habit. For
ten years Haile has used morphine,
and recently had become a burden up
on the authorities.
Ten years ago Haile is said to have
had brilliant prospects, and during his
early years of practice as an attorney
he was so successful that money in
vested in real estate brought him
large returns.
Haile comes of one of the best
families of Solano county. He was a
leader of society during his early life.
Only a few days ago he was brought
to the jail in Suisun suffering f >m
effects of an overdose of morphi •»,
and since that time his life has hi' g
in the balance. It is not believed ! c
will recover from the present attack. -

Methodist Services
An appropriate and very interesting
thenksgiving sermon was delivered by
Rev. J. C. Duncan at the Metnodist
church, Jackson, last Sunday evening.
The theme of Rev. Duncan's discus
sion, was upon the gratitude we owe
to our neighbor and Creator for the
blessings we have received under the
existing conditions of affairs.
The clergyman is an able and fear
less speaker, and his lecture which at
various parts touched the open Sunday
evening saloon question, gave his
hearers to understand that he would
combat the proposition, with a view of
having the saloons close their places
of business on the Sabbath evening.

A retiary was the name or a Roman
gladiator armed in a peculiar way. /He
was furnished with a trident and net,
with no more covering than a short
tunic, and with these implements he
endeavored to entangle and dispatch
his adversary, who was called a seeu
tor (from sequi, to follow) and was
armed with a helmet, a shield and a
sword. The name of the first is pro
nounced as if spelled re-shi-a-ry, the
accent on the first syllable.

Eiope and Get Married
The CalJ of November 28 gives the
following love affair and marriage,
whicn will be of interest to many of
our readers. Young Spottswood is a
a nephew of Mrs E. H. Harrington and
Mrs Jas. Jay Wright of this city :
To avoid any possible danger of par
ental opposition, Charles Spottiswood,
aged 20 years, son of W. J. Spottis
wood. a hardware dealer living at 707
Castro street, and Miss Florence Buck
ijjnaei, 17 years old, a recent gradu
ate of the convent of Notre Dame, suc
cessfully culminated a boy and girl
love affair by slipping away to San
Rafael last Friday and being married
by a justice of the peace. When the
legal ceremony was over they returned
to their parents, informed them of
the step, received the 1 usnal forgive
ness and yesterday were remarried in
the Church of the Holy Redeemer in
Collingswood street by Rev. Father J.
P. McGulre. They ara on their honey
moon trip now.
The two had been neighbors and
friends from earliest childhood. After
graduating from the convent of Notre
Dame the girl began to make prepara
tion to enter the convent of Santa
Clara. In the midts tf her preparation
young Spottiswood appeared on the
scene and renewed the wooing of
sdhool days. The parents of neither
had the least idea of the romance. The
two maintained their old attitude of
ehuma to each other, and their mar
riage was the first inkling they had of
the true state of affairs.
Spottiswoods is in business with his
father. The bride is a talented young
woman who left Notre Dame with
higg honors, whose musical ability is
d istinctly marked.

The Pine Grove Tragedy
James Lowry, who t was seriously
injured by the unknown maniac, who
ran amuck in Pine Grove as detailed
in the Ledger last week, has so far
recovered as to be out of danger.
The trained nurse who has been
waiting upon him left last Wednea-"
day, his condition no longer requiring
her assistance. He was badly clubbed
with a stick of wood about the ear
and side of the jaw, but the skull was
not fiactUred. He has recuperated
remarkably, quick considering his ad
vanced age of over 80 years.
John B. Dietrick, who was shot by
the tramp in Webster's saloon just be
fore the attack upon Lowry, is also
considered out of danger. He was
taken to the county hospital for
treatment shortly after the shooting,
but was released fromjthat institution
on Tuesday, and returned to his home
at Pine Grove.
No further light has been tnrown
upon the identity of- the assailant, who
was shot and instantly killed by
Clarence Berry after the attack upon
Lowry. It is still believed that his
name was W. Havis, who at one time
was a partner with Allen in the sul
phurets-saving plant in Jackson creek.

Money to be Refunded
An error was made by the ticket
seller at the show given last Saturday
evening, by charging the children 35
cents instead of the price advertized
for children's admission, which was 25
cents. This error was caused by the
fact that 35 tickets had been put in a
pack to be sold as 25 cent tickets, the
manager wrote the figures 35 on the
top|ticket, to inform the ticket seller
of the number in the pack, thinking
of course that the ticket seller knew
the prices to charge. The ticket seller,
however, took the figures 35 which
were written on the pack as meaning
35 cents, and charged that price, and
as a result many youngsters who pre
sented thoir two bits for admission
were denied a ticket, and went away
shedding tears over their' turn down.
Zehp' Dal Porto, who managed the
show, asks us to inform all those who
paid the extra ten cents to call on him,
and the money ■will be cheerfully re
funded.
Following is an account of the re
ceipts and expenses of the show as
given by the manager, Zeph Dal
Porto. The gate receipts amounted
to $192.95 and the expenses incurred
in staging the play amounted to
118.80, leaving a total of $74.15 as a
fund for the band.

Respectfully,
W. H. Grkknualgh,
Superintendent ot SchoolsHOW TO DODGE A HOLDUP.
First Be on tha Alert, Says a Deteo-
tiv« In Chicago.
Wbat is tbe beat thing to do In cass
you are held up?
"1 would bet almost anything I have
that If the citizen who is held- up
chould yell 'Police! 1 or 'J^urderl' the
holdup man would run away every
time," Is the opinion of Detective Cap
tain Wood of Chicago. ■
"The chief trouble Is thnt people nre
not on the alert. I nlwnys take the
outside of the sidewalk when out after
dark. Then If any one should hap
pen to L- lurking In a dark passage
way I have a good chance to see him
In time to be on my guard. If 1 saw
two uien come toward me late at
night nnd they separate I wonld get on
the outside of the walk. If they in
quire the time of me 1 would not give
it to them, ns this is likely to be mere
ly n ruso to snatch your watch.
"My advice Is, 'When out nt night
keep on the outside of the sidewalk,
keep on the alert, and If attacked
make nn outcry.*
"What Is the bnst thing to do In case
you are held up? That depends upon
the conditions that enter into the mat
ter, the weapon carried by tho hold
up man. for Instance." said Assistant
Chief Seh'uettlpr. "Some might have
a revolver and some a piece of lend
pipe. If your assailant is determined
looking and has a good sized revolver
it Is host to surrender.
"If the man hold up Is of more than
ordinary strength and confidence he
may sometimes knock his assailant's
gun out of his hand and get the better
of him. If the proper degree of carp
Is taken n holdup may sometimes be
avoided altogether. • If a man follows
you at night and stops when you stop
or walks opposite to you on the other
side of the street It Is likely that he is
a holdup man. The best thing to do
in that case Is to get among other
people or board a car or run Into a
nearby house." ;;V
CARE OF KID GLOVES.
How to Mend Them and Keep Them
From Stiffening.
If when kid gloves are worn the
bands become very hot and cause tbe
gloves to stiffen and shriuk, French
chalk will prove a good remedy. The
gloves should be put on and the tips
of the fingers dipped in French chalk
and rubbed gently one against the
other, then finally rubbed with a soft
duster. A little French chalk should
also be put in each finger.
It is a good plan when wearing ring*
under gloves to turn them with the
stones toward the palm of the hand.
This not only prevents marks, but is
more comfortable than when the rings
are worn the right way up.
Kid gloves should be removed by
turning them over the hand and after
ward turned right side out, blown into,
the creases smoothed out and finally
put away in a glove box.
Nothing looks more untidy than to
see any one wearing a pair of gloves
with the finger tips protruding or the
seams burst. So if you spy even a tiny
hole mend it without delay and with
fine cotton the same color as the kid.
Never use silk, as it cuts. Don't break
off the cotton, but cut it, or you will
draw the stitches too tightly together
and make the seam uneven.
When the finger seam Is split insert
a finger Into the glove and draw the
edges together so that they just meet
and no more. A ridge spoils tho look
of the gloves and feels uncomfortable.
How to Preserve Leather Furniture.
Leather furniture needs' constant and
intelligent care to keep It from drying
out and tearing into shreds or turning
to powder, lv the tirst pluce, don't be
afraid to apply <"i little suap nnd water
to it to wash off the dust and dirt.
Use soapy water, a sponge and ti paint
brusli to get Into the (olds of ; the
leather and the crevicea. The soapj
water will darken the Itfiitlipr. but
only temporarily. When Uii' leiither Is
dry here Is a ptvpiit'iirion that «'iil
do It fjood. It's simple— Just i>ih> par I
sweet oil :ind four jmrts benalut*. 'I)' 1
oil will darlien the leather a little, but
it will soon dry In and leave it the
original color. The surplus oil may be
removed by rubbing. Rub Into the
grain of the leather. This treatment
four times a year will preserve both
the life and the elasticity of your
leather furniture covering.
How to Keep an Iris Bed Sightly.
If you have a bed (if irisi tliat In a
blot oil your garden, while the with
ered stalks are laying up n store of
nutriment for next year's bloom, it Is
well to plant something in between
the plants tbat will make them look
less unsightly.
In between the Iris plants tbe seed
of mignonette can be sown about the
middle of April, nnd begonia super
florenr can also be used. These plants
take less nutriment from the soil than
taller growing plants, as their root
growth Is shallow. They also do well
in the partial shade that is needed for
iris.
How to Clean Plaster.
When plaster casts become soiled
with either dust or finger marks make
a creamy solution of dry starch and
cold water and apply it with a soft
brush, carefully wetting all crevices
and depressions. Set the cast aside to
dry, then remove the starch with a
stiff brush, and it will look as If fresh
from the studio.— Harper's Bazar.
How to Clean Glass Water Bottles.

Deafness Can not oe Cared
by local applications as they cannot
reach the dlfeaaed portion of the ear
Theru itf only one way to cure deafness
.and tliut is by constitutional remedies.
DfafnuKS is caused by an Inflamed con
dition of the mucous lioinj? of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can oe
taken out and this tube restored to its t
normal condition, hearing will bo de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing 1 but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.

Dog a Railroader
One of the trainmen on the Sugar
Pine railroad has a dog that is a
thorough railroader. He knows all of
the engine signals and when his master
whistles them he will "go ahead,"
"backup," "duck for a low bridge"
and do many other stunts. Lately he
has made several trips to Jamestown
when the train came down for gravel.
A few days ago when a sting of
flats had been loaded with gravel down
in Woods creek and were being taken
away, the dog jumped on the rear flat
and started to walk towards the en
gine. About the time the dog reached
the head flat the train was at the ae
pot. When the dog jumped to the
ground it was noticed that he limped.
His master examined the dog's foot
and in one of the front paws, tightly
wedged between the toes, was found a
$5 nugget which the dog had picked
up on his way over the loads of gravel.
Now evei'y time that clog limps some
railroader carefully examines its feet.
—Jamestown Magnet.
A sprained ankle will usually dis

One of the prettiest home weddings
of the season was that at the beautiful

north of town, their son,Leland Study,
being untied in marriage to Miss Alma

officiating. None but -relatives and
Rev. and Mrs Washburn were present.
The decorations were beautiful and
unique, the reception room being hung
with grapevines with the foliage ana
I clusters of fruit. The dining room was
a complete bower of graceful pepper
tree foliage, interspersed with baskets
of yellow and white chrysanthemums,
while in the parlor where the cere
mony occurred, the wall and lace
draped windows were festooned "with
garlands of smilax and tiny baskets ot
pink and golden roses. The bride is a
young lady who has made her home
with Mrs Shidy for some time, and
has gained many friends in this com
munity. The groom has resided for
many years in this vicinity and is well
known. After a bountiful repast the
young couple departed in an automo
bile, accompanied by a bevy of girls
and a shower of rice, to take the train
north for a two week's honeymoon,
after which they will return to reside
with the parents of the groom. — Stock

Dan Donovan, an old man living
near the Leota ranch was found dead a
couple of weeks ago. The old man
died while digging up a gopher hole.
His death presumably was from heart
disease, for when his body was found
by one of his neighbors, the man had
been dead seven! days and all indica
tions pointed to v painless death for
there had been no struggle to indicate
otherwise. — Prospect.
There is a very good prospect that
the State Fruit Canners Association
will transfer their box factories, now
located at Klamath Fails, to El Do
rado county. A representative of the
company was here last week, and two
sites were inspected which are avail
able for such a purpese, one near
Placerville on the east, and one at
Diamond Springs. The reason for the
proposed transfers is that the stun;
page and freight rates are excessive in
the northern country. C. P. Wood is
in San Francisco this week, and after
taking the matter up with some of the
directors of the association, he will
probably have something of interest to
give our readers, as he is out to boost
El Dorado county.— Mt. Democrat.

was given Wednesday of this week, by
which the application of the Ligh trier

in this court was denied. The suit re
ferred to that of Jas. V. Coleman vs.
the Lightner Mining Co,, for trespass
in taking rock from ground claimed by
the Angels quartz mine. As certain
questions relating to the ground in dis
pute, are now pending in the U. S.
Land office, the Lightnsr sought an or

In Reform School.
San Diego, November 23.— Harold
Melous, alias Guy Metzler, who eloped
with and married Miss Anna Scott of
Santa Barbara a few weeks ago, was
committed to the state reform school
at lone by the superior court of this
county this morning.
Mekrash was tried on charges of
forging the name of a wealthy San
Diegan, Horace B. Day. to two checks
aggregating $150. At the time of his
arrest he said he was but 17 years of
age, and upon verification of this he
was committed to the reform school
until he reached the age of 21.
His young wife went to Santa Bar
bara with her sister.

When Jackson Citizens Show the
Certain Way Out
There can be no just reason why any
reader of this will continue to suffer
the tortures of an aching back, the an
noyance of urinary disorders, the
(lungers of diabetes of any kidney ills
when relief is so near at hand and the
most positive proof given that they
cun bu cured. Read what a Jackson
citizen Bays:
Mrs Thomas Coombs. 173 Main street,
Jackson. Cal., says: "Last summer
I had a great deal of trouble from my
back and kidneys and nothing helped
me until I used Doan's Kidney Pills.
My back ached constantly and I always
felt tired and worn out. There were
puffy spots beneath my eyes, and
swelling was noticeable in other parts
of my body. I had taken Doan's Kid
ney pills while living in Central City
three years previous and remembering
how beneficial that had been, I again
procured a supply. In a short time
they drove away the dull, heavy ache
in m^back and restored mv kidneys to
a normal condition. 1 cannot speak
too highly in praise of Doan's Kidney
Pills."

Noteworthy is the especially heavy
increase over the amounts last year in
certain states. .In California the
amount rose by. over 25 per cent, in
Idaho ny over 352 per cent and in Ore
gon by nearly 50 per cent. The in
creases are the result of increased
activity in National forest timber sales
in these states and are an earnest of
what will happen as the timber supply
which the arovernment* is caring for
comes into full demand. Since the cut
of timber will always be limited to
what the forests will keep on growing,
the income to the states will be per
manent, not transitory, as would
have been the case if hasty and im
provident exploration had been per
mitted.

stnlos will eventually receive many
times what the forests are now yield-
Ing them, for there is as yet on the
whole only a very restricted demand
for the government's timber.
Wedding Announcement
, Wedding announcements of Miss
I Florence Winnie Dufrene and Julius
M. Perano, to be celebrated on the
14th of this month, have been sent out
this week. Miss Dufrene is the
I daughter of Mr and Mrs Wrr. D. Du*
frene of Newmanville. For several
years she has been employed aa an as-
I sistant In the Jackson postomce. where
by her courteous and obliging disposi
tion, she won the respect and admira
tion of a large circle of friendß. She
has recently resigned from that posi
tion.
Mr Perano is the son of Mr and Mrs
Nicholas Perano, who reside .on a
ranch near Jackson Gate. He is em
ployed at the Kennedy mine, and is
very popular and highly respected by
all who know him.
A comfortable home has been fitted

move, on their return from a long
wedding trip, which has also been ful
ly arranged for.

maid, and Joseph Raggio as best man.
Croup is most prevalent during the
dry cold weather of the early winter
months. Parents of young children
should be prepared for it. All that is
needed is a bottle of Chamberlain's
cough remedy. Many mothers are
never without it in their homes and it
has never disappointed them. . Sold by
all dealers.
