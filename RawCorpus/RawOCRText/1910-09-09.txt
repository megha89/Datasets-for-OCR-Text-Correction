Amiel Sanguinetti, who underwent
an operation at the Sutter Creek
sanitarium on Friday last for a swel
ling of the right knee, caused by a
sprain received lately, is rapidly re
covering the effects of the operation,
which is claimed to have been a
complete success, as nothing serious
was wrong with the knee, and that
the lad will »oon be up and around
again.
The leg was injured several months
ago by the 13 year old boy, and be
gun to swell and cuuse him much
pain. Local treatment, was given it,
but the operation was finally decided
upon as the only remedy for n suc

Attempts Suicide
A young Jackson Miss, who thought
life was not worth striving for if she
could not follow the dictations of he
own desires, became dejected when her
mother reprimanded her for a trivial
offense, and attemDted suicide by
swallowing a small amount of carbolic
acid. The girl was caught in the act,
and the bottle knocked out of her
grasp, thus saving her from an agoniz
ing death. Dr. Gall was hastily sum
moned and administered antidotes,
after using the stomach pump effect
ively on the now penitent girl.
The young Miss received severe
burns about her mouth, and her throat
is in a very serious condition, owing to
the effects of the acid.
Pretty Wedding
At 6 o'clock on Wednesday morning
last Miss Loretta Mac Rose and
Arthur Stanley James were united in
the holy bonds of matrimony at the
residence of her mother, Mrs Steve
Rose on Stasal aye., this city.
The wedding ceremony was a
beautifully arranged affair, the knot
being tied by the Rev. Thos. H.
Nicholas of the Methodist church.
The sitting room in which the couple
were made one, was profujely de
corated in ferns and carnations. The
dining room was decorated with ferns
and roses.
Mrs Rose, the mother, had a
bounteous breakfast prepared for her
early morning guests, the wedding
cake being a feast in itself.
Miss Winnie Dufrene, the brides
maid, was gowned in rose colored silk
and the bride in cream messaline silk,
carrying a bouquet of white rosebuds.
The bride was given away by her
uncle W. D. Dufrene. The happy pair
left on the stage for a honeymoon
along the coast, which will last for
several weeks, after which they will
return to Jackson where they will
make their future home.

BUSINESS
MEETING
Republicans Hold Busy
Session In Sutter
Creek
A meeting of the republican county
central committee waa held in Sutter
Creek, early this week, and waa at
tended by all the republican candi
dates of Amador county except those
from the Volcano district who were
unable to be present, owing to force
of circumstances.
An advisory committee was elected
consisting of C. M. Kelley township 1 ;
Charles Bloom, township 2; Joe Kidd,
township 3; Edgar Deacon, township
4; Henry Meyers, township 5; and Dan
Bona appointed at large.
The various candidates were as
sessed a small amount in order to
help defray expenses of the coming
campaign, which promises to be one
of the best managed campaigns ever
waged in the county.
The specking has been mapped out,
and will be adhered to by all the
candidates commening on October
25th at Drytown, and continuing until
election.
The republicans will have such
speakers as^ Judge Fred V. Wood,
Wm. Snyder, and Wm. H. Greenhalgh
in their party, and it will be worth the
time spent hearing the speakers at any
one of the places that will later be
published.
Ball Team Reorganized
Jackson's baseball team has dis
banded. This decision was reached
last week. The last few games under
the old regime were frosts both in
the character of the play and attend
ance, so manager and players came
to the conclusion that the- team's
usefulness as an attraction was at an
end, and dissolution was the result.
Jackson, however, will not be with
out a team. Other local lovers of the
sport have consented to take hold of
the players— men of business ability
and grit. The ball team was im
mediately reorganized, and J. A. Pic
cardo elected to manage the new club.
He needs no praise for his enthusiasm
in all local enterprises that tend .to
boost our city. His affable and busi
ness like methods are known by all
who have had the pleasure of meeting
him. He is usually selected as floor
director, when a notable ball is given,
and under his directions success is
always assured. He has built up a
host of friends, and a good business
with his associate, George Vela
through fair business methods, ana we
feel safe in saying he can give Jack
son such base ball as will be well
worth seeing foi' the remainder of the
season.
The old players will hold together to
a man, and that means Jackson will
have the strongest team in the • foot
hills. Valley Springs and Sacramen
to, two victorious teams, will be
played this season, and we are positive
the close of the season will be stronger
than the opening.
Excellent Program
Jackson's band concert was held on
Sunday evening of last week, and
proved all that anyone could expect.
The players are all taking special in
terest in their work, and the result
?s very apparent at the concerts.
The collection was made on Monday
by Palmer and Laverone and substan
tial funds raised to warrant a solid
organization, if harmony continues in
the future aa at present.
Following is next week's concert:
1. "Marvel," March - H. Filmore

Fine Place of Business
Vußeli, the jewelry man, has re
ceived his new display cases, ami
erected the same in his new jewelry
store on Main street. The tileinj?
has also been laid in the doorway of
this beautiful store, and the place is
now on a par with any city store.
BIG FAILURE
IN JACKSON
C. Giovannoni & Co- are
Forced to Close
Store Doors
The general mercandiae house of C.
Giovannoni & Co., including the
macaronni factory connected there
with, closed its doors on Monday last.
This is the heaviest financial failure
that has occurred in Jacknon, and for
that matter in Amador county, for
many years. The crash was not al
together unexpected, as it had been
known for a long time that the firm
was financially embarrassed. There
was no attachment levied, the credi
tors deeming that course unnecessary,
and h useless expense, but it was
hinted that the firm would be forced to
suspend business if such a course was
not taken voluntary. So Monday at
noon a notice was posted on the closed
doors, "Closed for stock taking," and
the whole establishment has been
closed since. There does not seem to
be anything going on inside.
The amount of liabilities is merely
a matter of conjecture. It is variously
estimated at from $20,000 to $25,000
and some places it is even higher.
The assets consists of the stock in the
store, which has been greatly run
down of late, and several pieces of
real estate, all incurnbered. The
credit system is conceded to be the
cause of this failure. The book debts
are estimated at over $30,000, enough
to wipe out all liabilities, but if they
were collectable. But most ot this is
worthless, extending over a period of
years, and outlawed.
Considerable of the liabilities of the
firm is represented by borrowed
money, from various parties, to tide
the firm over the crisis. This method
was adopted in hope that conditions
would improve, that collections would
be made, and the firm get on its feet.
It was continued, until the borrowing
power was exhausted, and there was
no other alternative but to quit.
This house has been doing as large,
if not larger, business than any
general merchandise house in Jackson.
Connected with the firm were the
three Giovannoni brothers, and two
brothers-in-law, all having families,
and all more or less participating in
the active work of the business.
A meeting of creditors was to be held
in San Francisco yesterday, but had to
be postponed on account of the absence
of A. Caminetti, attorney for the bank
rupt firm. Tbe merchant creditors are
represented by the board of trade of
San Francisco. There is no prospect
of the firm resuming business, and an
assignment is likely if the creditors
whose claims represent borrowed cash
can be pacified; otherwise insolvency
proceedings may be the last resort.
This failure is to be laid at the door
of the credit system, and the lesson to
be learned from it is the urgency of
getting out of the credit rut which has
been nurtured in this community for
so many years,' to the detriment of all
concerned. Merchants should get to
gether as they do in other cities, and
protect themselves from the unscrupu
lous who live by bilking buisness
houses by running up bills they donot
intend to pay. A board of trade wan
organized over a year ag to take the
initiative in this direction, among
other things, but evidently perished in
the process of birth. If this organiza
tion did nothing else than regulate the
creuit system, it would accomplish a
lasting benefit for this city, and all
concerned would be only too glad to
contribute the dues necessary to keep
it moving.
'New Home' In Jackson
L. C. White, the local furniture man
has added a new line to his stock.
He has recently accepted the agency
for the New. Home sewing machine,
and has several on exhibition at his
furniture store on Main street, Jack
son. It is unnecessary to comment on
the efliciency of the machine, as it
has stood the test for years. The
machine has a patent drop head and
lock for all compartments, and is in
every way equal to any make machine
on the market.

Bunker Hill
The work of grading for the addi
tional twenty stamps to the mill was
started Monday morning. A force of
twenty men was put to work on this
job, and it is the intention to press it
through to completion with all possible
speed. It is thought that by the be
ginning of next year the 40 stamps will
be dropping. The clean-up for August
month was practically the same as the
preceding uionth— s24,ooo. The 1950
level continues to open up in fine shape.
Newman.
The Calaveras Citizen says that Mr.
Esola, superintendent of the Newman
mine, near West Point, has been for
the last two weeks shipping high
grade ore by freight teams to Martell
station, whence it will be shipped to
smelters for treatment. There was re
ported to be about 50 tons to go, leav
ing about 150 tons second grade to be
milled at the mine.
Lincoln Consolidated.
Work is going on rapidly at the Lin
coln Consolidated at Sutter Creek.
Operations began July 16, and since
that time the machinery, derrick and
collar of shaft have been repaired and
put in good condition, and the shaft
during the past thirty days put down
126 feet, at which point water was en
countered. New 16x16 inch timbers
have been put in the shaft down to this
point, and the shaft straightened. A
short distance above the water a hard
hanging wall came in, and smaller tim
bers will now be used. The company
started its new electric pump last
week. It is a turbine, and will throw
350 gallons per minute. There is still
caved ground to go through, but from
the 350 level down the shaft is thought
to be in good condition. About 15 men
are employed, and more will be put on
as soon as the 500 level is opened.
The Kennedy mining company have
erected a large flagstaff in tne rear of
their office. The pole is about 260
feet high and is mounted with a large
Kilded ball. A weather indicator is
also attached to the pole.
The Zeila mining company are hav
ing extensive improvements in the
way of painting done at their plant.
The interior and exterior of the office
has undergone a thorough cleaning
and painting, and presents a very at
tractive appearance.
Magnificent Millinery
McGary's big department store will

millinery opening on Saturday, Sep

This opening is always a popular
event for all those who can only visit
the town on special occassions, and the
proprietor has prepared a special dis
play for this coming event.
Dr. Franklin Returns
Dr. Blake Franklin has returned to
Jackson, after spending several days
in San Francisco, arranging to have
his office fixtures and other neceasary
articles used in following his profes

WHAT IS THE ISSUE?
Theodore Roosevelt is cavoorting over the country making
political speeches to admiring thousands. It is his nature
to be before the footlights. He enjoys notoriety, and he is
certainly getting, if not all he wants of it, at least a surfeit
from the standpoint of industrial peace and stability. The
principal theme of the ex-president's speeches is honesty in
public and official life: he is against crooks wherever found.
In short, he is in favor of the right and against wrong,
whether private or official. We can see nothing distinc
tively Rooseveltian in such a declaration. He certainly can
not claim any originality either in the idea itself or its ad
vocacy. It is the same as right-thinking men in all ages
and all nations have contended for. No one, except those of
the crooked class, will take issue with him on this proposi
tion. There is nothing to justify going into hysterics over
this; or the crowning of the redoubtable colonel as the po
litical deliverer. The end aimed at. is desirable, but what
definite and practicable plan does he propose for its accom
plishment? On this point there is no new cure-all iv his
creed. Indeed, there could be none, beyond the deterrent in
fluence of laws for the protection of society by the punish
ment of wrong-doing — a remedy which is as old as the
human race. Roosevelt's speaking tour is interpreted as a
step toward another term as president. The thought of his
candidacy will not help business interests. He is classed with
the insurgent, or as he prefers to designate it, the "progres
sive," wing of the party. It is really the radical element,
of which senator La Follette, Pinchot and ex-secretary Gar
field are the prominent exponents, as against the conservative
element, of which president Taft is the distinguished repre
sentative, backed by the solid commercial interests of the
nation. To describe the situation as between progressives and
non-progressives is misleading, and entirely out of place.
The sincerity and patriotism of either side are beyond ques
tion. It is simply a difference of opinion as to which line of
policy will better promote the progress desired. The repub
lican party is now and always has been the party of progress.
Under the guidance of that party the United State have pros
pered as no other nation has ever prospered in a like period
of time. Some are disposed to believe that the amazing rap
idity of development has not been an unmixed good. It is
safe to say under republican rule we shall keep in the path
of progress, no matter whether this or that faction of the
party gains the asceudancy. The trouble would begin if
through the factional strife, the real reactionaries — the dem
ocrrtic party — should get iv the saddle, and give us a taste
of their pet schemes of progress.
The proposed city ordinance, making radical changes in
the present law governing the retail liquor business in Jack
sou, was put over until next month for dcci ive action. It
was not discussed at all at the meeting of the trustcs held
last week. It may be safely asserted, however, that while
the records show merely a postponement of the matter, the
ordinance will not be passed, as the trustees realize that it is
a dangerous measure in several respects.
The name of Lincoln-Roosevelt league, as the designation
of the prevailing faction in the primary election, will no
longer be heard of. The organization has been disbanded,
and its membership merged into the republican party. That
was certainly a wise stroke of policy, tending to party har
mony and success in the campaign now on.
Congressman Englebright announces that, if relected, he
will not vote for Cannou for the speakership of the next
cougress. Our representative is to commended for this re
solve. He doubtless thinks as much of Canuou as he ever
did. But the welfare of the republican party is of more im
portance than the personal ambition of any individual mem
ber — whether Roosevelt, or Cannon or any cne else. The
issue of whether Cannon shall or shall not be retained in the
speaker's chair involves na question of principle; it is simply
a matter of policy. To select another mau as speaker will
remove one fruitful source of dissatisfaction, and tend to pro
mote harmony. And this of itself is suffiicient . to justify
the relectiou of a new speaker.

fearfully mangled, nessitating its

The forest fire, which burned in the
vicinity of Confidence, on the West
Side Co's lands for the past two
weeks is now under control, after
burning over 100 square miles of terri
tory. The fire is said to |.have been
started near Thompson's Meadow's by
a hunter, who was lost in the woods
and when night came on he lit a camp
fire which got beyond his control with
the above disastrous results. The
West Side Lumber Company kept t a
force of fire fighters on the grounds id
protect their choice timber, as most of
the burned territory was lands from
which their best timber had been re
moved. Many stock men had their
ranges and dry feed destroyed. While
the loss to the West Side Co. is com
paratively small, yet the wages paid 1
to the fire fighters by the company to
protect their interests amounted to
over $300 per day.— lndependent.
For sometime past negotiations have
been pending for the sale of the App
and Rawhide mines, and it is cur

the famous mines with all their
' elaborate equipment has been made.
The Democrat haa been unable to
verify this report. Capt. W. A.
' Nevills, who practically owns the en
tire property, which is operated under
the corporate name of the Rawhide
, Gold Mining Company, has been ab
sent from the county for the past
! month, and inquiry at tho App mine,
i which is being run at full blast,
elicited the response that the office
, management had no information con
[ cerning the reported deal, and that the
property was being operated as usual
under the same management.— Union
Democrat.
Friday of last week seven hundred
and fifty pounds of dynamite exploded
at the Queen mine near Rich Gulch,
but fortunately no one was injured by
the explosion. The powder, which was
thought to be of no account, owing to
the age, had been left on the clump of
the mine in its original boxes. Super
intendent Courtmarsh and one of tho
mine employees on the day of the ex
plosion had gone into one of the tun
nels for a lot of wedges that had been
left in there for the purpose of bring
ing them out and placing them in the
sun to dry. They loaded a car with
wedges and on their return from the
tunnel Courtrnarsli picked up what he
supposed was an empty powder box
.about half full of sawdust. Ho carried
it to the dump near to the place where
the supposed useless powder was and
threw the box over the bank a distance
of about 10 feet. Instantly there was
an explosion, and in an instart the
powder in the boxes on top of the
dump was seen to blaze. Courtmarsh
started to run. and when he had
reached a distance of about thirty
yards the entire seven hundred and
fifty pounds exploded with a fearful
crash. Courtmarsh was knocked to
the ground and cut on the breast with
a piece of flying rock but otherwise
was uninjured. The force of the ex
plosion tore half of the blacksmith
shop away and wrecked the ' bunk
house, while at the boarding house
the windows and sashes were all
broken as well as over half the
dishes. It is a fortunate circumstance
that there were none of trie men who
are employed at the mine any
where near where the explosion oc
curred, otherwise there would have
jeen a fearful loss of life. — Citizen.
Don't Have to Run
Any person who was voted for at
the recent primary election and there
by became the nominee of any party
for office can decline the honor by
notifying the county clerk. County
clerk, Ted C. Atwood has sent out cer
tificates of nomination to all persons
whom the returns show are entitled |to
have their names go upon the ballots
when they are printed. Any person
receiving such notification who does
not wish to become ' ' a good thing
with no chance of reward can decline
to have his name printed on the ticket
by so informing the clerk. — Nugget.

years more, has branched out into a
new method of trying to win votes.
Me has had several thousand litho
graphic pictures of himself struck off
in San Francisco, a portion on card
board and the rest on paper and
mounted on cardboard, after the fash
ion of Hiram Johnson, who made such
a whirlwind canvass for the republican
nomination for governor, aud who was
not personally acquainted with one in
a thousand of the voters. It is argued
that if the plan worked so charmingly
in the larger field, why not equally es
well in the more restricted field of Am
ador couuty. So the pictures of "U S
Gregory, regular democratic nominee
for sheriff," and late aspirant for the
republican nomination as well by the
circular and stump speech route, are
being sown broadcast over the county,
the lurger one for ornamental purposes
in show windows, etc., and the others
for distribution as introduction cam
paign cards The pretty picture busi
ness is a happy inspiration, and will
make the sheriff familiar to the thous
ands of voters, to whom he is person
ally a stranger. This move is being
commented upon throughout the county
in various ways. Some are inquiring
if the original is "stuck on himself,"
if the pictures are to convey the idea
that after so many years in office he is
no longer able to get around as for
merly to make a personal campaign;
some go as far as to ask whether he is
fretting "vain and foolish with increas
ing years." Anyhow the Ledger office
acknowledges a valuable addition to its
art gallery. , :

The socialists, of whom there are
just an even thirty In Tuolumne
county, according to the vote cast for
J. Stitt Wilson, their candidate for
governor, are demanding that candi>
dates of other parties receiving nomi
nations upon their ticket step down
and out. They claim, and probably not
without reason, that no one not fully
sharing their convictions should be
masquerading on a socialist ticket.
Still, it will have to be admitted that
socialists had full control of their own
conscience and some must have broken
away and violated the party pledge In
voting for democrats and republicans
in the primary election. Inasmuch as
the names of the successful candidates
on that ticket were written in, the
socialists assert that they can be
legally withdrawn. They don't want
any candidates on their ticket unless
they be of the Simon pure socialist
variety. — Democrat.

Clarisa Burt into Chemung county,
N. V., when that part of the state
was first being settled.
She was married to William Mc
lntyre on September Ist 1845.; V;'V
Mr Mclntyre came to Californa in
March' 1852, expecting to remain only
a couple of ye ars, but instead of re
turning to New York, he sent for his
family, which at that time consisted of
his wife and daughter, who is now
Mrs Benj. Ross, a little son having
died after Mr Mclntyre's departure
for the goldfields. Another daughter,
now Mrs Finley Goodman, was born to
them after Mrs Mclntyre arrived in

Panama, crossing the Isthmus by rail
shortly after the road was completed,
and continued on her journey by
steamer to San Francisco, thence to
Sacramento by steamer and from
there to Volcano by stages, arriving
about the 28th of December, 1859. She
was known for a number of years, by
the old settlers as "Lady Me."
From childhood, she was very in
dustrious, and when not engaged in
her household duties she was ever
busy with her needle, making em
broidery or patchwork gui Its, the latter
being her favorite pastime, she hav
ing pieced and completed more than
one hundred patchwork quilts, and
continued to enjoy the work until she
had passed her 83 year. She always
loved to be out of doors, and spent a
great deal of time walking or visiting
with her friends who were less for

Arm Broken By Fall
Miss Hilda Green, daughter of Mr

street, was unfortunate to fall off a
small donkey, which she was riding in
a field on the Jones' ranch, on Thurs
day last, thereby breaking the wrist
A number of small children had as
sembled in the field and intended to
have at least one more good day of
pleasure before school commenced, as
they expressed it. They had two or
three donkeys which were compelled
to do all kinds of stunts, several toy
pistols were on hand, and a regular
rough riders show was to be given.
The accident,' however, threw a pallor
over the affair, and the show was

A mysterious disease of trees and
shrubs in Paris has been charged to
road tarring by M. Foresiier, engineer
in charge of streets. The effects
have been specially noticed in the Bois
de Boulogne, which magnificent avenue
is a mile long and, nearly 400 feet in
total width, with a central . roadway
more than 50 feet wide, two 40-foot
sidewalks, and a continuous line of
gardens on each side.. Until within a
few years the varied collection of
trees, shrubs and other plants have
continued in fine condition. Since the
tarring of the roadway, however,
many trees have died, their leaves
becoming covered with brown and
white spotsjand shriveling up as if
burnt, and brown and shrunken leaves
have appeared on many living speci
mens of lilac, currant, Deu zia, chest
nut, . maple and catalpa, while such
herbaceous plants as geraniums and
begonias have ceased to blossom.
Many of the engineers at the Brussels
Road Congress doubted that the tar
ring was the cause of the diseased
vegetation, in spite of the apparent
connection.
A novel and brilliant stage effect is
said to have been the idea of an act
ress of Charlottenburg, Miniature
C;ini,.s carried as personal decoration
in fancy dances have had a pleasing
appearance, but this German perfor
mer has sought something more sen
sational by covering her costume with
stripes of finely divided metal, and
bringing each stripe into the circuit
of a small electric current of high vol
tage and high rate of oscillation. On
a darkened stage, the figure appears
in a wild and startling garb of ribbons
of lightning.
The use of motor-cars has been
found by H. T. Wakeham, an English
county surveyor, to have been attended
by an increase in cost of road main
tenance in 41 counties of 41 per cent in
10 years. In Surrey the increase
reached 138 per cent. The low increase
of only 7 per cent in Middlesex is at
tributed to the use of the touchest
basalts for roads, with an annual
painting with a hot bituminous coat
ing.
With chloride and bromide of radium
at $100 a milligram, or $6,5U0 a grain,
the use of radium to give artificial
color to precious stones has little in
dustrial promise. To give a more ac
curate idea of the possible changes,
Armbrecht, in London, has been ex'
perimenting for many months, and
has produced somo remarkable effect)
upon color. About 200 whito sap
phires—pure oxide of aluminum— were
kept in contact with radium two or
three weeks. About 70 per cent
turned yellow, the shades ranging
from lemon to dark orange ; a few, ap
parently from another locality, be
came green, pinkish or amethyst color,
and a very few changed to rose color.
A light blue was imparted to two or
three— too light to give value ap
proaching that of the much-prized
deep blue sapphires, pale emeralds
were somewhat darkened by radium,
but were not given the deep green of
the expensive stones. Brown diamonds
were bleached almost white, nothing
being obtained like the beautifnl blue
gem into which Sir Wm. Crookes
transformed a yellow diamond.
Amethysts were altered by radium in
to smoky or yellow quartz, dirty ap
pearing pearls • were cleaned to a
clearer white, but opals were not
amenable to treatment.
Hemoglobin, an albuminoid sub
stance containing iron and sulphur,
gives red blood corpuscles their color
and is the carrier of oxygen from the
lungs. It is possible to isolate and
even crystallize it, and Dr. E. T.
Reichert of Philadelphia, experiment
ing with the blood of 2800 living
animals, has endeavored to classify
the varying forms of crystals accord
ing to their sources, ' and to read in
them some new lessons in evolution.
The crystalls from a white man '&re
narrow rectangular columns. Those
from the orang-outang are very simi
lar, but those from negroes and goril
las aie short and thick. The hemo
globin crystals prove the close re
lationship of the domestic cat and the
African lion and of the horse and the
mule. Such crystals may have prac
tical importance in criminal cases,
and may decide whether a, drop of
blood is from man, woman, child,
adult, old person, white, or negro.
The rust-proof black coating pro
duced on iron or steel by boiling in a
solution of 4 ounces of phosphoric acid
and 1 ounce of iron filings in 1 gallon
of water has been tested by immersion
for a year in salt water. The metal
remained uncorroded, while a similar
untreated pic.c was badly rusted.
The thermal storage system of
Druitt Halpin accumulates hot water
during the hours when a boiler's load
is light, and thus adds to the steam
raising capacity when the demand is
greatest. The spherical-ended storage
cylinder of boiler plate is placed hori
zontally over the boiler, with a steam
pipe leading from the top of the boiler
through the bottom of the cylinder and
almost to its top. A second pipe
leads from the bottom of the storage
cylinder downward into the boiler be
low the usual water level. By this ar
rangement the storage cylinder is
filled with steam from the boiler, and
the live steam heats the feed water
entering the cylinder and flowing by
gravity into the boiler. By a valve in
the second pipe, the feed can be so
regulated that when little steam is be
ing used more water enters the cylin
der than flows from it into the boiler.
The hot water nearly fills the cylinder,
and is drawn upon when more steam
is needed, the cold water entering the
cylinder being then cut off. In » Lon
don electric light plant a storage cy
linder 8 feet in diameter and 24 feet
long wa3 placed over each of the four
watertube boilers. Tested at its
highest capacity, one of the boilers
showed an increase in evaporation of
about 60 per cent during nearly three
hour?. The average steam pressure
was 185 pounds per square inch, and
the temperature in the storage cylin
der was 860 deg. P.
The phototelephone of Ernst Rhu
mer, of Merlin, an improved form of
Bell's photophone of '30 years ago, de
pends upon the sensitiveness of an arc
Htfht to sound and the changing
electrical resistance of selenium under
variations of light. The apparatus
consists essentially of a searchlight
projector at the transmitting end and
a selenium cell in a telephone circuit
at the receiving end, and [ft transmits

Many Fires.
Incendiary fires seem to be the or
der of the day in various parts of the
county, and will doubtless continue till
some one meets up with a Winchester
ball placed where.it will do the most
good. There were three fires started
this week in the vicinity of the Ben
son mins near Angels, one at nine
o'clock in the morning, one at eleven
o'clock and another in the afternoon
of the same clay, all without doubt of
incendiary origin. They were ex
tinguished before much damage was
done. A man by the name of Brown
from Mokelumne water ditch saw a
man in the act of setting fires in the
Banner country last week. He shouted
to the man who ran through the brush
and escaped before he could be identi
fied. — Prospect.

Stockton, Cal, C!u»«H»aßiHiiJi inifi r'lijiiniwr'fgLETTER TO
COMMUNIST
Bill INye Declines Offer
to Whack Up With
Applicant
Dear.Tr: Your courteous letter of
the first instant, in which you cordial
ly consent to share my wealth and
dwell together with me in fraternal
sunshine, is duly received. While I
disilke to appear cold and distant to
one who seems so yearnful and cling
ing, and while Ido not wish to be re
garded us purse-proud or arrogant, I
must decline your kind offer to whack
up.
You had not heard, very likely, that
lam not a Communist. 1 used to be,
I admit, and the society no doubt ne
glected to strike my name off the roll
of active members. For a number of
years I was quite active, as a Commu
nist. 1 would hnve been more active,
but I had conscientious scruples about
being active in anything then.
While you may be perfectly sincere
in your belief that the great capitalists
like Mr Gould and Mr Vanderbilt
should divide with you, you will have
great difficulty in making it perfectly
clear to them. They will probably de
mur, and delay, and hem and haw,
and procrastinate, until finally they
will get out of it in some way. Still,
I do not wish to throw cold water on
your enterprise. If the other capi
talists look favorably on the plan, I
will cheerfully co-operate with them.
You go and see what you can do with
Mr Vanderbilt, and then come to me.
You go on at some length to tell me
how the most of the wealth is in
the hands of a few men, and then you
attack those men and refer to them in
a way that makes my blood run cold.
You tell the millionaires of America to
beware, for the hot breath of a bloody
handed Nemesis is already in the air.
You may say to Nemesis, if you
please, that I have a double-barreled
shotgun standing at the head of my
bed every night, and that I am in the
Nemesis business. You also refer to
the fact that the sleuth-hounds of
eternal justice are camped on the trial
of the pampered millionaire, and you
ask us to avaunt. If you see the other
sleuth-hounds of your society within a
week or two, I wish you would say to
them that at a regular meeting of the
millionaires of this country, after the
minutes of the previous meeting had
been read ana approved, we voted
almost unanimously to discourage any
sleuth-hound that we found cacped on
our trail after ten o'clock p. m.
Sleuth-hounds who want to ramble
over our trails during office hours may
do so with the utmost impunity, but
after ten o'clock we want to use our
trails for other purposes. No man
wants to go to the great expense of
maintaining a trail winter and summer,
and then leave it out nights for other
people to use and return it when they
get ready.
Ido not censure you, however. If
you could convince every one of the
utility of communism, it would cer
tainly be a great boon to you. To
those who are now engaged in feeding
themselves with flat beer out of a
tomato can, such a chance as you
suggest would fall like a ray of sun
shine in a rat hole ; but alas ! it may
never be. I tripd it a while, but my
efforts were fruitless. The effect of
my great struggle seemed to be that
•men's hearts grew more and more
stony, and my pantaloons got thinner
and thinner on the seat, till it seemed
to me that the world never was so
cold. Then I made some experiments
in manual labor. As I began to work
harder and sit down less I found that
the world was not so cold. It wr s only
when I sat down a long time that I
. felt- how cold and rough the worlJ
Yeally was.
Perhaps it is so with you. Sedentary
habits and stale beer are apt to make
us morbid. Sitting on the stone door
sills of hallways and public buildings
during cold weather is apt to give you
an erroneous impression of life.
Of course, I am willing to put my
money iafro a common fund if I am
convinced that it is best. I was an in
side passenger on a Leadville coach
some years ago, when a few of your
friends suggested that we all put our
money into a common fund, and I was
almost the first one to see that they
were right. They went away into the
mountain to apportion the money they
got from our party, but I never got
any dividend. Probably they lost my
postoflice address.

Carry Arsenal Along
A large auto brought Jackson no
less noted visitors on Friday evening
last, than the famous actor, James K.
Hackett, Thornwall. Mullnlly, of the
United Hallways of San Francisco,
and C. S. Thomas, a mining engineer
of Denver, Colorado. The party were
on their way up the mountains on a
hunting expedition and carried with
them a well developed arsenal, com
prising of everything from a Colt re
volver to a maximum Nornfelt auto
matic gun. Upon picking up a copy
of the Ledger and leading the account
given of the capture of two bears
near Doak's ridge, the party decided
to go to that locality for their hunt
ing.
At their request to be shown through
a mother lode gold mine, they were
obliged by W. F. Detert of the Zeila,
who escorted them through the mine
on Saturday morning.
Hackett finished his season in San
Francisco on Wednesday last, and was
invited as a guest of Mullally and
Thomas to accompany them on a big
game hunting expedition. .

Moves Into Rectory
Rev. Thos. Shea, rector of the Epis
copal churches of Jackson and Sutter
Creek, moved into the rectory at No.
53 North street, on Friday last. The
clergyman has been living on Summit
street in one of Geo. Brown's houses,
owing to the fact that the rectory had
been leased for a term. The rectory
tennants, however, secured another
home, and immediately vacated the
church property 'in order toaccomo
date'the clergyman and allow him to
occupy his own place of residence.
A new brick chimney will be erected
at the rectory of the Episcopal church
to displace a pipe which has been do
ing service since the place was first
built. This, we are informed, will
greatly reduce the insurance on both
church and rectory.

Damages Awarded
A decision rendered by third district
court of appeals confirms the judg
ment of the Calaveras county superior
court awarding A. E. Roberts $5760
damages against the Sierra Railroad
Company of California. Roberts was
injured on June 26, 1906, when a car
of dynamite on the train on which he
was riding exploded. He had pur
chased a ticket on that day, but missed
the regular passenger train, so with
the consent of the division superin
tendent began his journey on a freight
train instead. When the damage case
was heard in the lower court, the
superintendent claimed that Roberts
had agreed to assume all risks, before
he was given permission to ride on the
freight train. Roberts admitted as
suming all risks but contended that he
did not agree to be repsonsible for any
negligence of the railroad company,
and that it was negligence of the com
pany that permitted the train to be
derailed and subsequently caused the
explosion of dynamite. •

Pitiable Condition
Nick Kukovich, who was brought to
Jackson from his place of residence in
Amador, where he had been kept
under guard by relatives, owing to
his tendencies of becoming violently
insane, has grown decidedly worse in
his incarceration in the insane ward
here. A party of Austrians called on
the unfortunate man on Saturday
afternoon last, and used every effort
to try and have the victim divorce
some of his deluded ideas. At times
he became so rational as to be able to
speak a few words intelligently in his
native tongue.
The delusions of the victim are about
the most pitiable that were ever re
corded. As he sits in his padded cell
securely strapped to his cot he con
tinually works might and main until
his strength is exhausted, drilling im
maginary rock with a hand drill and
harrrmer. Then again he pulls on a
rope until he lays back tired out from
his exertions. At intervals he regains
his speech, and then cries that he is
caved upon and, must drill himself
out. He feebly cries he is far down
in a mine, and must save himself,
pointing to the slate colored walls of
his paddled cell, he said, ' 'See those
walls of rock, " and then he went on
drilling as only a maniac could.
A kindhearted Austrian had brought
him a bag of grapes, but he failed to
recognize them, and only ate them
when they were fed to him.

THE VOICE
If I were a voice— a persuasive voice —
That could travel the wide world
through,
I would fly on the beams of the morn
ing light,
And speak to men with a gentle might,
And tell them to be true.
I'd fly, I'd fly, o'er the land and sen,
Wherever a human heart might be,
Telling a tale or singing a song
In praise of the right— in blame of the
wrong.
If I were a voice— a consoling voice —
I'd fly on the wings of the air;
The homes of sorrow and guilt I'd
seek,
And calm and truthful words I'd
speak,
To save them from despair.
I'd fly, I'd fly, o'er the crowded town,
And drop, like the happy sunlight,
down
Into the hearts of suffering men,
And teach them to rejoice again.
If I were a voice— a convincing voice —
I'd travel with the wind;
And whenever I saw the nations torn
By welfare, jealousy or scorn,
Or hatred of their kind,
I'd fly, I'd fly, on the thunder crash.
And into their blinded bosoms flash.
And, all their evil thoughts subdued,
I'd teach them Christian brotherhood.
If I were a voice— a pervading voice —
I'd seek the kings of earth;
I'd find them alone on their beds at
night,
And whisper words that should guide
them right,
Lessons of priceless worth.
I'd fly more swift than the swiftest
bird,
And tell them things they never heard,
Truths which the ages for aye repeat,
Unknown to the statesmen at their
feet.
If I were a voice— an immortal voice —
I,d speak in the people's ear;
And whenever they shouted "Liberty"
Without deserving to be free,
I'd make their mission clear.
I'd fly I'd fly, on the wings of day,
Rebuking wrong on my world- wide
way,
And making all the earth rejoice —
If I were a voice — an immortal voice.

Don't Break Down.
Severe strains on the vital organs,
like strains on machinery, cause
break-downs. You can't over-tax
stomach, liver, kidneys, bowels or
nerves without serious danger to your
self. If you are weak or run down, or
under strain of any kind, take Electric
Bitters the matchless, tonic medicine.
Mrs J. E. Van de Sande, of Kirkland,
111., writes: "That I did not break
down, while enduring a most severe
strain, for three months, is due wholly
to Electric Bitters. " Use them and
enjoy health and strength. Satisfac
tion positively eruaranteed. 50 cents
