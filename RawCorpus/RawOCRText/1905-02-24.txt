"DOUSING" RODS.
Art of Divination In the Bowels ol
the En rlli Explained.
There ia undoubtedly a practical art
of discovering 1 springs. Indians ot
frontiersmen can find water in the des
ert when a "'tenderfoot" cannot. Mexi
cans and experienced prospectors can
similarly find ore. These arts consist
inainly in the recognition of superficial
signs which escape the ordinary ob
server.
It is not necessary that the operator
should consciously note these signs
separately and reason upon them. No
doubt he frequently does so, though ho
may not give away the secret of his
method to others. But , in many in
stances he recognizes by association
and memory the presence of a group
of indications, great or small, which he
has repeatedly, found to attend springs
or ore deposits. Tl4>s skill, due to habit,
is often almost unerring for a given
limited district, but under new condi
tions it ■breaks down. Old miners from
California or ' Australia have often
made in other regions the most foolish
and hopeless attempts to find gold be
cause they thought this or that place
"looked just like" some other place in
which tl»ey had mixed successfully.
Apart from the magnetic minerals
there is no proof that ore deposits ex
hibit their presence and nature by any
attraction or other active force. With
regard to water, however, there may
be an action affecting the temperature
and moisture of the overlying surface.
Even here, however, It seems more
likely that such effects are manifested
visibly to a close observer rather than
by direct affection of his nervous or
muscular system. The favorite fields
for water diviners are regions in which
water is abundant, but not gathered
upon given horizons of impermeable
strata underlying porous rocks.—Cas
sier's Magazine.
ONE CAUSE OF ILLNESS.
Rldlcnlous Fnda That Spring; From a
Smatterlns of Knowledge.
A famous physician upon being asked
recently what is the chief cause of ill
health replied: Thinking and talking
about It all the time. This ceaseless
introspection in which so many of the
rising generation of nervous folk in
dulge is certainly wearing them out.
When they are not worrying as to
whether they sleep too much or too lit
tle they are fidgeting over the amount
of food they take or the quantity of ex
ercise necessary for health. In short,
they never give themselves a moment's
peace. Our grandfathers did not con
cern themselves with these questions.
They ate, drank, slept, as nature
prompted them. Undoubtedly they
were healthier in mind and body for
their sublime indifference, and if we
asked ourselves fewer questions we
should have less time to analyze or im
agine ailments.
That medical science has made re
markable progress in the last few dec
ades cannot be denied. The fault for
some presen Way undesirable conditions
lies not with the doctor, but with the
patient. There has been too great a
tendency on the part of the Ifiity to ac
quire a smattering of medical knowl
edge through the reading of so called
"health" magazines and pamphlets and
to put into practice on their own ac
count that "little knowledge," which, it
cannot be denied, is a "dangerous
thing." The following of some most
ridiculous fads along the lines of eat
ing, drinking, sleeping and exercise has
assisted In swelling the mortality sta
tistics. Our .grandfathers would hold
up their hands iv horror at many of tho
foolish things we do in the name of
"health." A little more of the com
fortable nonchalance of our healthy an
cestors would do no harm to the rising
generation.— Housekeeper.

The One
Letter
CHANNING POLLOCK
Copyright, 1904, by Channinc Pollock
After they had come to an under-
Btamling Frank Claxton took Virginia
Carter to dinner at Gloranf s. This un
derstanding, the result of many misun
derstandings, put an end to their en
gagement, and they chose to hold the
wake over their dead love at the tiny
restaurant where It had been. -born.
Neither talked much during the meal,
and when either, spoke, for some rea
son not easily explained, it was in a
very low tone. The man said, "I sup
pose I had better return your letters ?'*
"There must be a great many of
them," responded the girl, the corners
of her mouth trembling Into a faint
smile.
"Yes. In— in three years"—
"I shall send yours tomorrow — that
is, I shall send all but one. I should like
to keep one— ln memoriam. May I?"
"If I may."
"Certainly. 'A fair exchange,' you
know."
Claxton left her at the door of her
apartment something less than an hour
later. On the way to his own home he
marveled that he should regret what
had happened so little. The petty quar
rels of the past few mouths had worn
out his endurance, he thought, and ren
dered him indifferent to meir culmina
tion, lie wondered how. she felt about
it.. At all events, .the separation would
leave him with' more time — more time
to work, more time to devote to the
friends he had neglected since he had
begun caring for her.
In the matter of the quarrels he did
not consider himself blameless. He
realized this, and admired himself a bit
for the inherent generosity which pre
vented his hojding her solely to ac
count.
Claxton reached his "place" In rather
a relieved frame of mind. He opened
the door. with a key fastened to a silver
riuj? that she had given him on his
birthday and walked straight across
the library to his typewriter. Beside
the machine was a tiny cushion she
had made for him to rest his elbow
upon when he was "reading copy." He
recalled that it had come wrapped in
numberless pieces of paper, each one
inclosed "inside the other, like the eggs
In a Chinese puzzle. That was about
tho time that the Interest aroused by
his tale of Central American life had
opened the hearts of editors toward
him.
Somehow the detective story he had
intended to begin did not fly from his
finger tips as speedily as he had ex
pected. The first paragraph, after
writing which, ho told himself, things
would go better, stood alone on the
page, a succession of stilted and unin
viting sentences.
"Not in tho mood," he confessed at
last and strolled down Broadway to his
club. The boy at the door didn't know
him, and when, after satisfying the stu
pid fellow of his membership, he saun
tered into the lounging room he was
in an exceedingly unpleasant humor.
"Parsons been here this evening?" he
inquired brusquely of an attendant.
"Xo, sir," renjicd' the man. "He does
not come very often now, sir. Married,
I believe."
Claxton cursed Parsons from the bot
tom of his soul.
"Graham?" he asked.
"Mr. Graham -was In about a week
ago. We don't see him more than once
a fortnight."
"Funny," mused Claxton. "By George,
I wonder If there's any one In the
place?"
There was, in the writing room-
Frederick Ford Ferguson, a youth Just
coaxing a timorous mustache Into ex
istence and tolerated only for the sake
of his father, Major Ferguson, former
ly of the Ninth infantry. Claxton
would gladly have passed the young
ster by, but he was bailed before he
could regain tho hall.
"Stop a bit, old chap. I want to read
you a line I'm sending to a friend of
mine at Daly's. Rather a clever letter,
you know."
Claxton tore himself away and went
back home. What was Miss Carter do
ing? He would have wagered a hun
dred that Phelps had called and taken
her out. Confound Phelps!
The story Avent more smoothly, stim
ulated by the resentful energy of its
author. -From 10 o'clock until nearly
daylight the typewriter clicked inces
santly. When it stopped clicking, seven
pages of manuscript, much marred by
pencil marks, lay on the table near at
hand. It was a good story, he felt sure,
although there were two or three de
tails concerning which he would have
liked a conservative opinion. "I'll take
Virginia out for luncheon and read It
to her," he thought. Then he remem
bered that they had agreed never to
see each otter again— voluntarily, that
is.
Tho day, which began with his rising
at noon, dragged along monotonously.
It was hard to realize that he might
not speak to her over the telephone that
stood on his desk and harder still to be
convinced that she would not call him
up. Toward midafternoon Claxton un
locked a drawer and took out the nine
packages of her letters that represent
ed a correspondence of three years. He
must choose the cue. letter and return
the rest to her.
To do this he must read every epis
tle in tho nine bundles. Claxton, in
common with most men who write or
act, was a sentimentalist, and he want
ed that the one letter should be the
dearest of all. The first that met hla
eye he laid aside in the belief that It
■would provo the dearest. Mies Carter

was the message. "Otherwise I should

3f attending you." It was a Wpnanly
letter— the letter of a woman . . iture In
heart and brain— and Claxton pondered
i long while before putting it aside.
Next came a telegram. • pent to his
apartments before the telephone had
been installed: "Please come tonight.
Am blue. Have wired Minnie st:iy
home." A very sweet, dependent lit
tle message, but of course not to be
thought of aa the single memento of
so close a friendship as theirs had
been. It was even preferable to retain
the short note which he h;td iihv.tys
ascribed to her literary genius rfltjer
than to her feelings. "Each thought of
you, dropping into the -waters of my
heart, produces ever, widening circles.
of tender recollection."
Then there was an envelope froai
her, on the back of which he had comp
osed a fragment of verse. It began:
Thou art bo dear to me. my love—
So dear and, oh, so necessary!
Claxton remembered that she hid
prized the poem above anything o'.se
he had given her. "It is so fine to be
thought 'necessary,' " she had said.
In this manner he progressed through
five of the nine packages. Each leiier
seemed more desirable than the rest,
and every moment made a selection
less easy. This scrawl was a reassur
ance which she had penciled on the
leaf of her programme at the theater;
that sheet of blue paper bore the first
words of affection he had ever received
from her.
At the bottom of the fifth bundle was
a long envelope with the name of a
publishing company on its upper left
hand corner. The postmark was over
two years old. "Rejected manuscript,"
Claxton concluded, tossing It to one
side contemptuously. That had come
back in the days when rejected manu
scripts had not been half so rare as
good dinners or money with which to
pay rent. Something approaching cu
riosity made him pick up the envelope
again and draw the contents from its
mouth. The story that lay before him
was headed, "From Frank Claxton, ?' I
West Twenty-first Street," but the
type unmistakably belonged to the ma
chine which still remained a fixture
at Miss Carter's. The tale was one
that she had sent over his signature to
an editor of whose opinion she had felt
certain, and itjiad in consequence been
returned to hfm when that gentleman
had classed it as "unavailable." "I
thought you'd get a check," Virginia
had confessed, "and I knew you'd
spend It without considering whys and
wherefores. It's just like Phelps! He
was enthusiastic over the plot when I
told it to him last week."
"Virginia," he had remonstrated, "it
was like offering me charity."
. "Nonsense! I shouldn't have thought
of handing you money. I simply wrote
a story for you tha{ you might have
written yourself If you had taken
time."
"Taken time! Good Lord, how much
time be bad taken that year in just
such discouraging, unremunerative la
bor I How unhappy he had been and
how awfully, awfully hard up! He
hadn't begun spending every evening"
with her then, and he hadn't begun
selling whatever he wrote either. "No
body ever did— at first," she had as
sured him.
For twenty minutes Claxton sat si
lently on his chair island in the middle
of a sea of letters. His fingers clung
to the rejected manuscript, but his eyes
looked beyond it into the past. All the
half forgotten history, of his love for
Virginia Carter had been recalled to
him with wonderful vividness— her .un
varying goodness, the sweetness" of
their intercourse, the erstwhile strength
of his affection for her. A ship's clock
in the adjoining room struck 2, the
nautical fashion of saying that the hour
was 5, and with quick resolution he be
gan climbing into his evening clothes..
"I've come fo take you to dinner," lie
said to Miss Carter when she respond*
ed to his pressure on the button at her
door.
"So you were lonely, too?" she asked
him.
"Lonely? By George, and those let
ters"—
She was too clever a girl not to seem
surprised, and he could not look
through the sides of her trunk into the
tray where reposed several packages
of his letters to her, unsearched, un
touched, since first they had been read
and laid away.

The Chaplain's
Cleverness
C. B. Lewis
Copyright, 1904, by C. B. Lewis
.one' day at the Third National bank,
In the city of Cornopolis, a stranger
walked through the president's room
and past the bookkeeper's and took
from the pile of money stacked at the
paying. teller's right hand four pack
nges of §10,000 each. He was^coolly
walking out again when stoppedl>y the
president and a gun. .'* >-
The man was known to the police bs
"Slick Charlie," and to tell of all his
adventures would fill a book. It was
foj£his' attempted theft of the $40,000
that he was scut to the Woonson peni
tentiary for five years. The officer who
delivered him behind the doors of that
institution said to the warden:
"Here>is a man you want to keep an
eye on. Don't lose sight of him day
or night. He is bold and nervy on the
one hand and slick and sly on the
other. Don't trust him for an hour,
or he'll beat the game."
The warden was a new man at the
prison; but, having been sheriff of a
county, he thought he knew about all
sorts of criminals and replied that
No. J 870, as "Slick Charlie" was re
corded, would have to get up early in
the morning to beat him.
If a prison chaplain were to be ques
tioned abont religion" in a "prison he
would answer that scores of prisoners
lived up to it and were earnest and de
vout. If an experienced warden were
to be questioned, he would answer that
just -when a prisoner began to "set
good" he should be watched tho closest.
The 'chaplain at Woonson was a good
man and one who had faith In him
self.' He thought his advice and ap
peals to burglars and murderers -pro
duced the desired effect. Among the
prisoners he was known as an easy
mark.
The new warden was wary of antag
onizing the captain and a man not
well posted on the tricks of criminals,
so No. S7O found things easy for him
when he entered prison. When he had
hadf full opportunity to size up the
chaplain he began to "set good." He
was as earnest about this as ho had
been in appropriating other people's
goods. Ho became contrite and hum
ble, and he wanted to be turned from
paths of wickedness. Of course the
chaplain did his best. When the po
lice officials heard that "Slick Charlie"
had been converted they notified the
warden in writing that he would be

out of the "pen" within three months,
and the chaplain sent an official com
plaint to the governor that the police
were trying to discredit his labors.
The chaplain was a .man forty-five
years old, while No. 870 was only thir
ty. The chaplain was four Inches the
taller, had stoop shoulders and sham
bled as he walked. He also had a pe
culiar intonation. The slick convict
gave up his original idea of digging for
liberty to study the chaplain. . At the
end of five months he was one of the
teachers in the evening school. At the
end of seven he asked and got liberty
to hold a Bible class on Sundays. He
wrote and the chaplain delivered a ser
mon on "Christianity In Prison," which
was commented on by hundreds of pa
pers. Up to this time he had been
working in the tailor shop. He was
now given charge of the prison library,
and his plans were as good as carried
out.
It wa3 the habit of tbe chaplain to
visit the prison every afternoon from
3to 5. A part of the time was spent
with prisoners in their cells— men who
were undergoing light punishment—
and a part in tho library, and he al
ways left pretty promptly at 5. In go
ing out he passed three guards at lock
ed gates and went through the ward
en's office and out of the main door.
No. 870 had held the position of libra
rian for three months, and It was mid
winter. One afternoon the chaplain
had been visiting in the prison aud re
turned to the library at a quarter of 5.
As he entered the room he received a
blow that knocked him senseless, and
when he recovered his wits half an
hour had passed and he was tied hand
and foot and gagged. It was C o'clock
before he was released. .
In the course of that hour No. 870
had done some wonderful things. Aft
er'knocking down the chaplain he hp.fl

bud secured his man with ropes and
locked the door behind him as he
emerged. Shambling down the corri
lot to the first guard, he had said:
"James, I came away today with
only a dime in my pocket. Can you
lend me a dollar until tomorrow?'-'
"With the greatest of pleasure, chap
lain." And the money had been hand
(Hl over.
The same game had been played on
ii!e two others, and then the "chap
lain" had eutered the warden's ofllce.
He could have passed right through, as
the official Twas busy, but instead of
that he took a chair and waited for
ten minutes. When the warden was
iit liberty he was asked for a loan. of
?10, aud the "chaplain" reported to
him on the welfare of three or four dif
ferent prisoners before saying good
uisut. Fifteen minutes after leaving
the prison the .disguised prisoner en
tered the largest store iv the town and
borrowed ?20 of- the merchant ' and
then disappeared. •
. When the library door was broken
open at 0 o'clock and the real chaplain
found there was a great commotion.
Three gatemen were ready to swear
that the clergyman had passed out,
taking a dollar from each as he did so.
The warden had seen and talked and
loaned money to the same man. Two
guards had also seen him. Here were
six prison officials who could swear to
a thing, and yet that thing was not a
fact. No. 870 had simply imitated the
chaplain down to a line— his voice,
gait, speech and general look.
At 11 o'clock the next forenoon the
president of the Third National bank
of Cornopolis" was called out of his
room for a moment. 'During hjs ab
sence a man dressed like one of the
clerks in the bank entered the room
and bore away a package of bonds of
the face value of $18,000. "Slick Char
lie" wanted to be revenged upon the
bank, and he wanted money with
which to leave the country, and he tar
ried in the town to get both. The pres
ident of the bank is sure of this, be
cause a note left on his desk told him
so.
llow Thimbles Are Mnde.
■ In the making of a thimble there are
several operations, the blank passing

the band. Then the thimbles, which
have assumed a form warranting tbe

of the little indentations which receive
the end of the needle and assist in
pushing the point through the fabric.
Placing the cup In a lathe, the opera

of the thimble. During this- operation
a peculiar and by no means unpleasant
musical sound Is emitted with varying
tones. The point of the thimble being
reached, a flat knerler finishes the side,
and with a sharp edged tool the pol

is performed. Then on another . lathe

After 12,000 of Napoleon's soldiers

Of 75,000 Austrian troops he addressed
them thus: "I am displeased with you.

In tears the battered ¥eterans re

The soldiers of the enemy were three
to one. Try us once more. Place us
in the post of danger and see if we do
not belong to the army of Italy." In

Little is known of Correggio, which
would argue that he was of a retiring
disposition. He was born in the little
town of Correggio, twenty-four miles
from Parma. In the latter city he was
educated, but in his seventeenth year
an outbreak of the plague drove his
family- to Mantua. By 1514 he was
back In Parma. For some years he
worked here and painted many, famous
pictures. It may have been because of
grief over the death of his young wife,
but at the age of thirty-six, indiffer
ent to fame and fortune, he retired to
the little town where he was born. All
that is known regarding his death is

TWENTY YEARS' SLEEP.
Up Van "Winkle's Case May Hard
Been More Fact Than Fiction.
Even superficial students of folklore
tnow that the tale of Rip Van Winkle,
supposing that Irving really heard it in
the old Dutch settlements along the
Hudson, Is by no means peculiar to
that district, but Is found in some form
or other all over the world. In other
words, the Idea that it is possible for a
human being to survive In a state of
unconsciousness for a very long time
would jseem to be either a universal
fancy or to be founded on some actual
experience.
Dr. Lancereaux in the Paris Bulletin
of the Academy of Medicine reports
such on experience, the case of a wo
man who actually did, so far as intelli
gent consciousness was concerned,
sleep almost exactly twenty years.
p"atient, of a neurotic and hyster
ical family, had always been delicate
and nervous. On May SI, 1883, she
was severely frightened and fell Into
violent hysteria, which after twenty
four hours passed into j unconscious
ness. In this condition, Interrupted ev
ery month or six weeks by sudden con
vulsive attacks, she lay until May 23,
1903, kept alive entirely by injections
of nourishment.
On May 23 she was seized with hys
teria similar to that at the beginning
of her sleep, and the next day there
was another convulsion. On May 25
she began definitely to recover con
sciousness and . by the next day was
able to speak intelligently of events
before her sleep and could also remem
ber from day to day since her waking.
Of happenings during her sleep, such
as the drawing of some of her teoth,
she knew nothing. On the evening of
May 28 she died peacefully.
The particular case -is of interest
chiefly to the medical profession, but
the general fact of survival in uncon
sciousness for a very long tune shows
how such tales as those of the Sleeping
Beauty, the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus
and Ilip Van Winkle, to mention only
the most familiar examples, could have
originated from actual experience and
observation. Very likely such cases oc
curred more than once.
"Truth is stranger than fiction," runs
the old saying. It "is undoubtedly more
correct to say that fiction is merely en
larged, reduced, distorted and other
wise decorated fact and that without
a fact within general knowledge from
which to start fiction could not exist.
It Is entirely safe to conjecture that at
some prehistoric period, sleeping not
out of doors, of course, but under shel-

Henry VIII. and Puddings.
Bluff King Hal, otherwise Henry

of puddings. At one time he gave a

Aldgate for herself and her heirs for

King Henry VIII.'s private accounts
occur again and again entries of hla
rewards to different housewives for
bringing hhn puddings. A typical in
stance runs thus: "Item. The same
day paid to the wife that made the
king podings at Hampton corte, vis.
vlijd." This would be about $1.75, but
its value was much greater when the
entry was made. This love for "fine

FRIDAY FEBRUARY 24, 1905
THE SOCIALISTIC DRIFT.
The advocates of socialism belong
almost exclusively to the thriftless,
improvident class. One of the
orators of that propaganda address
ing an audience in Jacks m recently,
divided society into two classes,
namely, property-owners and non
property owners. Those who suc
ceeded in accumulating something,
and those who failed or neglected so
to do. It is human nature the world
over for the man who has nothing,
whether as the result of his own
shiftlessness or of misfortune it
matters not, to rail at conditions as
they exist, and seek to change the
same by a division with the thriftier
class. According to the tenets of
socialism it is aH wrong to own
property, whether of land or mov
able effects, as individuals. All
wealth, they claim, is the product of
human toil, and should belong to
society as a whole, and uot to indi
vidual members thereof. All dis
tinctions of rich and poor should be
abolished. The world owes every
man a living, and nothing more.
With proper adjustment there is
enough for all, and to spare, and the
social system should be so managed
that every one should be doled out
his portion from the common fund.
The incentive to action— the desire
to accumulate property — which,
under the present system is the
dominant trait of character, would
be done away with. The whole
fabric of society would be changed
with this disappearance of the rul
ing motive to make headway in the
world, as it is now generally under
stood. Some will contend that
practically this would mean the
death blow to ambition. Not so.
Ambition is inseparable from human
nature. It cannot be throttled by
any conceivable change in conditions.
Dammed up in one direction, it will
manifest itself in another. The sub
stitution of the co-operative system
— socialism — for individual owner
ship, would remove human ambition
from the main channel in which it
now flows under the present system.
It does not follow, however, that
men would be ambitionless under
the altered conditions. Indeed, it is
argued that this most potential
force in the human make-tip would
simply be turned to more useful
channels. The desire to excel would
manifest itself in the arts and
sciences, in the sphere of invention,
'and in fact in every department of
human activity.
The purpose of this article is not
to discuss the vagaries of socialism,
as that vague method of government
is generally understood. We are
apt to dismiss such doctrines as
merely the teachings of discontented
and impracticable dreamers. The
talk that it is the coming political
issue in the United States may be a
correct forecast of the future. At
any rate it is a long way froai being
a pressing issue just now. If it ever
does reach a position as a living po
litical question, there is little doubt
that the intelligence of the American
voter will thrust it away in the back
ground. It is undeniable however
that a great deal of our law making —
or the propositions emanating from
the law making bodies — are fashioned
after the socialistic pattern. The
tendency is to shift the burden of
maintenance from the individual to
the community at large. The state
treasury is looked upon in a great
measure as the common fund, to be
drawn from those who have acquired
something, for the support of those
who are needy. Eyery successive
legislature witnesses a drif.t more or
less pronounced in this direction.
Perhaps if the framers of these
measures were twitted with socialis
tic leanings they would indignantly
repudiate the impeachment. But
the fact remains that the burden of
law-makers is to strike down the
spirit of self-reliance and independ
ence in the individual, and place the
burden of responsibility upon society
or government. The state is, in an
ever increasing ratio, placed in a
paternal light. It is the state's
province to look after the bringing
up of the child from infancy to man
hood, and to take care of him even
after reaching the age of maturity.
Numerous instances might be cited
in proof of this assertion. Our
statesmanship is developing along
the lines that everything essential
to good citizenship should be free.
The more items are placed on the
free list, the more efficient the gov
ernment will become. It is extreme
ly doubtful whether this position is
tenable. As a rule, free things are
seldom appreciated at their real
value. It is when the object sought
is reached through struggles and
sacrifices, that success in any par
ticular path is properly appreciated.
The spirit of self-reliance should be
fostered above everything else.
That is the true bulwark of any
nation.
This tendency to lean upon the
government, is seen in the drift of
bills in every legislature that con
venes. An act recently introduced
providing for free text books in the
schools is a case in point. And the
discussion thereon serves to accent
uate the tendency. One legislator
said as a reason for passing the bill,
that he knew of children that were
kept from school because of inability
of the parents to buy the school
books. This play to the galleries
was no doubt considered a bulls-eye
hit— a clinching argument. He
might have added that children were
kept out of school from want of foot
gear and other articles of clothing,
and argued that a bill should be
passed to furnish free clothing for
all to meet such isolated cases. It
would be every whit as reasonable
as to provide free text books for all,
simply because one per cent perhaps
are unable to buy for themselves.
The attache nuisance — taking
money from the public treasury to
pay politicaldebts — is in the same
line of business. Also the idea that
pervades more or less every part
of the state, that incites members to
quarter public buildings and institu
tions within the boundaries of their
respective districts. It is nothing
less than a clear-cut reversal of the
relationship of citizens to the gov
ernment—namely, that it is the duty
of the citizen to support the gov
ernment, and not the duty of the
government to support the citizen.
The latter is the socialist doctrine,
it not in words, at least in spirit.
It has developed so alarmingly, that
ordinary methods of providing rev
enue are voted totally inadequate,
and new-fangled schemes are sug
gested to meet the growing evil.
No matter what gold-mines in the
shape of new tax projects are opened
up, the tendency herein referred to
will grow in an ever-increasing ratio
so long as it is fostered and en
couraged by legislative action. Ex
pansion will never stifle it; the
breaking-point must be faced sooner
or later.
THE RAILROAD CHANGE OF
FRONT.
The sudden change in the railroad
situation so far as the towns of Jack
son and Sutter Creek are concerned,
has been the absorbing topic of con
versation for the past week. The
concensus of opinion is that if the
railroad is pushed to its original
destination point near Martell's sta
tion this spring, it will remain there
for some time at least. How will
this affect the two towns — Jackson
and Sutter Creek— that lie equi
distant north and south of the pro
posed terminus? The intimation
has been given out that Jackson can
secure the extension of the road to
any suitable depot site within its
limits by paying tribute to the com
pany for the same. The demand of
$20,000 iv cash, and land — over eleven
acres for depot site and the right of
way the entire distance from Jackson
to Oneida, taking a strip of 50 feet
on either side of the track — is equal
to a grant of at least $30,000. This
ultimatum is all the more remark
able when it is considered that from
the outset it has been held out by
the promoters that the people of
Amador county would not be asked
to contribute one cent, outside of a
convenient depot site in the towns.
Coming on the heels of this declara
tion the demand of a large bonus for
bringing the railroad into town, with
the implied threat therein contained
that if the money was not forth
coming the terminus would be per
manently located over two miles
away, has naturally kindled a feel
ing of bitterness among the citizens.
We know not what" the people of
Sutter Creek think of the proposi
tion, but in Jackson — which repre
sents the major part of the traffic
upon which the railroad must depend
for its financial success — the hos
tility is outspoken. A policy of
enforced contribution riles up the
pugnacity of human nature. It is
much easier to awaken antagonism
than to appease it afterward. It is
therefore regrettable that the rail
road authorities have taken this step.
Adolph Weber, the Auburn moral
monstronsity, has been found guilty
of murder in the first degree, with
out recommendation, for the murder
of his mother in November last.. He
was accused of killing, all the mem
bers of his family, father, mother,
brother and sister, setting lire to
the home in the hope of destroying
the evidence of his crime. His'de
meanor since his arrest and during
his trial has been phenomenal in its
utter lack of feeling or realization
of the enormity of the tragedy. , The
verdict carries the death penalty,
and was reached after 21 hours de
liberation. While the trial was one
of the most remarkable cases of cir
cumstantial evidence on record, the
outcome is universally regarded as a
just judgment.

The senate committee of investi

against the four members, Bunker,
Ernmons, French and Wright, has
found a verdict of guilty as charged
and recommends the expulsion of
the boodlers. Owing to the serious
illness of senator Emmons, action on
the report has been delayed. That
th 3 senate will sustain the report is
hardly open to doubt.
SOMEWHAT RUFFLED.
The editor of the" Ledger doe 9 not
seem to like the idea of a newspaper
man asking for a public office, and ex
presses himself on that strain anent
the editor of this paper applying for
the position of clerk of the district
court of appeal. The Ledger man con
cludes by saying, "in all serious
ness the governor might do much
worse than to appoint Mr. Wood to
the position for which he is now men
tioned.-" In this we concur, but there
is only one worse piece of humanity
whom the governor or anybody else
may appoint to be dog catcher or any
old thing, and that is the editor of the
Ledger. Since the Ledger is the self
appointed high priest of Amador county
politics, we should have asked permis
sion of his magnitude, the great dic
tator, before proceeding. It is a well
known fact and common talk that who
soever the Ledger supports for any
office, straightway is he ruined, and
this is said to be the reason why Gov
ernor Pardee came near being defeated
in this strongly republican state two
years ago. In this case as well as most
always, our Jackson cotcm, in continu
ing a disturbing element, is meddling
with other people's affairs and displays
gross ignorance. It would be well "if
our esteemed friend would become ac
quainted with the facts before blowing
off again.— Amador Record.
We are pleased to publish the fore
going, giving it the benefit of the
Ledger's larger circulation. Our
cotemporary should be more circum
spect in his criticism, and not ruffle
his feathers in the wrong direction.
The editor of the Ledger has said
nothing about the Record man's lat
est-born aspirations for office. He
penned not a syllable of the article
referred to, and had no knowledge
of it until after it was in print, be
ing absent from the county at the
time. The editor of the Ledger is
not opposed to newspaper men as
piring for public position per se;
but we may as well remark right
here, that the Ledger is emphati
cally opposed to the idea that the
mere possession of a newspaper is in
itself the all-important recommenda
tion for public position. Further
more, we may say that as a rule it
is the feather-weights of journalism
whose aspirations have the chronic
officeward drift. The real journalist
has a higher opiniou of his profession
than to degrade it by using his
columns to promote his personal
ambition. It may also be remarked
that the flotsam and jetsam of news
paperdom — those who are but the
playthings tossed hither and thither
on the surface of the political whirl
pool — are afflicted with hungering
and thirsting for office, and too
often get there.
The flattering opinion of the Record
concerning the Ledger is a matter
of supreme indifference to us. But
" we dissent" from the intimation
that in discussing this matter the
Ledger "is meddling with other
people's affairs." When a man puts
himself up for office, whether elective
or appointive, he thereby voluntarily
places himself on the firing line of
criticism, and his fitness or misfit
ness for the position sought become
legitimate subjects of discussion.
Moreover, the " we concur" bit of
self-laudation seems to us in ques
tionable taste, and while fully recog
nizing the genial qualities of the as
pirant for a clerkship of a district
court of the supreme bench, we
also willingly " concur 1 ' that the
"governor might do much worse
than to appoint Mr. Wood," at the
same time we indulge the hope that
after a careful survey of the field of
eligible candidates, and animated by
a desire to promote public interests,'
he may possibly be able to do some
what better.

Mr. Maco's Outlawed Claim.
The lone Echo, in commenting upon
the rejection of Fayette Mace's claim
for $250, alleged value of gravel taken
from his land and hauled onto the pub
lic roads in township two, says:
As a simple matter of equity if it is
true that the county got the benefit of
$250 worth of gravel from Mr. Mace's
land and the understanding was that
it was to apply on the judgment against
him, he should be given such credit,
and if the fact, be shown that such a
contract was uir-rM into between the
county's representative and Mr. Mace
before the gravel was taken, the super
visors, this paper believes, will deal
fairly in the matter. .
Supervisor Amick asserts that he
authorized no such an agreement, and
if he believed such was the agreement
ho would pay it out of his pocket, be
fore Mr. Mace should lose it.
There is no question that the gravel
was taken from Mace's land and spread
over the roads, whether to the extent
of 1000 yards, which is the amount
claimed, at 25 cents per yard, we do
not know. The county received the
benefit of the material. It is an ele
mentary principle that private prop
erty shall not be taken for public use
without just compensation. Whether
the county, through its agents or
officers, entered into an agreement with
Mace to allow a reasonable price for the
gravel, as Mr. Mace claims, or whether
no express contract was made in regard
thereto, as the county contends, makes
not the slightest difference. The tak
ing of the gravel was in itself an im
plied contract to pay. The only rea
son, we presume, why the board of
supervisors did not go into the merits
of the case, was, that they were es
topped by the statute of limitations.
Over one year had elapsed since the
last load of gravel had been taken.
This was not denied. Tho law clearly
enjoins the supervisors from consider
ing any claim under such circum
stances. By allowing any sum for the
gravel, they would have made them
selves liable to prosecution for paying
an illegal claim. There is no question
of equity about it. Mr. Mace—prob
ably had a good claim in the first place.
By his own laxity he has lost what
ever rights he had in the premises.
Equity will not come to the aid of one
who sleeps upon his rights. It is un
fortunate that Mr. Mace should furnish
gravel without pay therefor, but he,
and not the board of supervisors, is re
sponsible for that outcome.

J. Driscoll, an inspector of the post
office department, was in Jackson
Tuesday. His mission was to hunt up
a matter that occurred throo years ago.
A parcel of mushrooms was received at
the local office about that time from
Italy. Such articles are subject to

that it was returned to Washington for
non-payment of duties. Tho postal

Chris Marelia took a trip over the
new railroad from Ranlett to lone one
day last week, in company with Wil

making the return trip by the same
route, and they did, but in a way that
was unexpected. It happened that the
.train from San Francisco was three
hours late, and the superintendent of
the new road, H. V. Hooy, was expect
ed thereon, to bo conveyed to Ranlott
tho samo evening. Tho delay on the
main line disconcerted the plans at this
end of the connecting road. Marelia
and Dennis concluded to foot it back,
counting the ties of the now road. To
make matters still worse, Marelia took
(with him a valuable dog, which ho
would not have parted with for a $20
piece. He left tho animal in lone,
without money and without price. The
brute didn't have ,-onso enough to keep
out of way of the train, and got run
over and killed. Chris has fully re
covered from tho walking match home
ward, but he still mourna the loss of
his pot dog;.

Much complaint has been made of late
on account of the poor quality of light
supplied to Jackson. In some business
places the lights have been so dim that
it has been found necessary to burn
gas as well as the electric light. The
trouble is said to be caused by the fact
that the wires are too light to carry
such a current as is necessary to keep
the lights up to standard quality. The
business has outgrown the capacity of
tho wires. To obviate this heavier
wires are being put up, so that Jackson
will soon be able to have electric lights
of standard poivur.

THE RAILROAD PROPOSITION.
Citizens of Jackson Do Not Favor Sub-
sidizing Railroad
The proposition as presented by the
magnates of the lone and Eastern Rail
road to demand $20,000 iv inonoy and
right of way and depot site for each of
the towns of Jackson and Sutter Creek
as the price of building the road to
those towns, as stated by the Ledger
of last week, was strictly correct. That
was the shape in which the matter was
first placed before the citizens. The
people did not take kindly to the invi
tation. Indeed, a hue and cry instant
ly went up against listening to any
such proposal. The following day.
Saturday, the plan was somewhat
modified. It was then intimated that
if Jackson people would take up the
bonds of the company to the tune of
$100,000, at 5 per cent discount on par
value, the company would agree to
bring the road into town.. Of course
this was to be in addition to providing
depot site and right of way from the
Oneida. This modification met with
no more favor than the original prop
osition. The truth is the road was en
gineered from the start that local
capitalists would not be asked to sub
scribe for stock or bonds; they were
ignored in the matter; there was plenty
of money on the outside to be had, and
the road would be -built and equipped
and owned by the promoters and out
siders interested in the scheme. This
was perfectly agreeable to the business
community generally. It" was an im
material matter how or by whom the
enterprise was carried out; so long as
the road was built to the towns desig
nated in the application for franchise
the people were fully satisfied. True,
the survey of the line to Martell's only,
and the contract for building extending
only to that point, was regarded as
misty, but this was explained that it
meant nothing more than that the
road was to be built in sections. After
reaching Martell's, survey and con
struction work would be prosecuted to
the two towns without delay, and on
the same basis as the other portion of
the line had been constructod-^-nainol v,
without help from the clti/ens. Tlie
investors were after business, and
would be fully satisfied if thoy corralled
all the traffic between lone and the
minine towns; that would sulliciently
repay them for the outlay. Such was
the attitude of the promoters from the
staVt. It, therefore,, was a serious let
lown when the $20,000 bonus was
sprung. The feeling is decidedly hos
tile. We have npt beard one voice
raised in favor of contributing in the
way proposed, The furnishing of a
reasonable depot site— not such an-ex
tensive tract as proposed, which is
betweon 11 and 12 acres— and the so
curing of the right of way from Oneida,
is not considered unreasonable. Be
yond this, however, there is little dis
position at present to yield.
Contested Homestead.
The case of H. F. Vogt vs. T.
Beauchemin, involving a contest be
tween the agricultural and mineral
claimants of a tract of land on the
Mokelumne river, in the vicinity of
Electra, came up for hearing befpre
the Sacramento land pffi.ee last week.
Beauchemin proved up pn his homer
stead over two years ago. Vogt at
that time filed a protest, alleging that
the land was mineral In character, and
that it included a portion of two min
ing claims held by him. There was
some doubt whether there was any
conflict, in the absence of a definite
survey, and so the papers went pn to
Washington. The Washington author
ities held that the fact of conflict must
be first established. A survey was
made and it was found, so it is claimed,
that the homestead did actually in
clude the greater p,arfc gf two. mining
claims of record. Hence the hearing
to determine the mineral or non -mineral
character of tlje lapd. J. W. Caldwpi}
represented the contestant, Vogt*, who
appeared with several other witnesses.
Silas Penry was attorney for the home
stead claimant. After hearing a por
tion of the contestant's case, that side
was brought to a halt through inability
to furnish further fee.s fqr taking testi
mony, and as far as that side was con
cerned the hearing was continued.
The homesteader then put in the whole
of his testimony. The case is there
fore hung up, until such time as the
contestant is prepared to put in the
balance of his ,t«stjmpny, which -con
sists of two or three witnesses.

they expect to secure a liberal quantity
of yellow stuff.
Baroni & Co. are getting all the lava
stripped from their claim, and are get
ting into the gravel. They expect to
reap a rich harvest in quggots and fine
gold.

guarded I may be able to soeuro the

Furnishing Official Bonds.
County treasurer Gritton put in a
claim before the board of supervisors
at the last meeting for $120 for prem
ium for official bonds furnished by one
of the guarantee companies engaged in
that business. The claim was rejected.
It is said there is a law now on the
statute books making a claim for official
bonds a county charge. Under this
law all county officers are enabled to
get their bonds from a responsible com
pany 1 without charge to themselves.
It is claimed in behalf of the law, that
it is better for the county to secure
protective bonds on the outside in this
way, than to adhere to the practice
heretofore followed of each officer
traveling over the county and getting
property holders of his political or
party friends to the number of a score
or more in some instances to go security
for him. If one loss occurs the indi
vidual bondsmen stand .together and
resist collection through the courts.
We have had instances of this kind in
Amador county, and years have elapsed
before the county got anything. One
particular case the claim was whittled
down to about 25 cents on the dollar,
and finally settled on a basis of that
kind. These facts are referred to in
proof that the polioy of having official
bonds furnished by guarantee com
panies is in line with public interests.
But why the county treasury should
bear the cost is another question. The
claim was repudiated in face of the law;
on what plea we do not know, unless it
be that the law making it a county
charge was passed after the present
county officers took their seats; in
which case it might apply to future
officials, but not to present incumbents,
X- Op P. ANNIVERSARY.
Bathbone Lodge Celebrates the Anniver-
sary of the Order.
One of the most enjoyable social
functions that has taken place in Jack;
son for many years was, t}ie pqtortain
ment given la.s.t Friday evening by
Rathbone Lodge No. 166, K. of P., in
honor of the anniversary of the es
tablishment of the order" in America.
The order had its origin in 1864— over
half a century ago— and its 51st anni
versary was selected by the lodge to be
commemorated in fitting style by an
entertainment that would live in the
pleasing memories of those whq par
ticipated therein. The affair took
place in Odd Fellows hall. Invitations
were sent broadcast over- the county,
$nd in respouse thereto 205 persons
were assembled to witness tho cere
monies, many being from Sutter Creek,
Amador City, and other outside towns.
The program was varied and jflterefct
ing, including an address of welcome
by Dr. A. M. Gall, singing of solos and
duets, instrumental music, recitations,
etc. After the literary exercises were
through, the company repaired to the
banquet rqqin, wh,ere. delicacies in pro
fusion and variety tp gratify the most
epicuerean appetite were spread,
Toasts and responses thereto were also
in order. As a wind-up qf the pro
ceedings a social dance was Indulged in,
which terminated an evening of un
alloyed pleasure. The affair finally
broke up about 3 o'clock in the
morning.
1030 CONCERT.
Love's hall was fillod tp overflowing
on Wednesday evening when the peo
ple who held sway in 1830 again, ap
peared upon the stage under tho
auspices of the New Idea Club, and in
their most anoient manner and dressed
in their original 1830 costumes en
deavored to entertain the modern peo
ple of Jackson. Just h.QW well they
succeeded was evincod by tha thunder
ous applause that followed each num
ber. Skirts with hoops, skirts without
hoops, and skirts that took three pair
of hoops to give them a prominent ap
pearance were in evidence on tho stage.
We Uttlo wondor that the doors to the
dwellings of oqr forefathers occupied
the whole side of the houso. Our grand
mothers must have cut a wido swath
when on dress parade. The entertain
ment began promptly at 8 p. m., and
continued uninterruptedly until 11:15.
Every number was a credit to the man
agement. Reuben and Rachael brought
down the house. Doc Caldwell must
have been a beau ideal in his younger
days. Miss Smith has a twinkle in her
eye that may mean yes, oven though
she answers no.; She might bo only
"foolin." The five little tots in their
character song were recalled, and never
missed a step in the difficult march.
The tableaux were all beautiful, each
representing an idea originated by the
Now Idea Club. Mrs. Duden with her
collection of wax figure 3 scored a great
hit. Each figure after being wound up
would imitate some person. They
really appeared like sensible people,
but their mistress assured the audience
that they were not. Too much praise
cannot be given Mrs. Dr. Endicott for
the manner in which she arranged and
successfully carried out the musical
part of the program. Over $100 was
taken in through sale of tickots. The
club will now be able to pay all its
obligations on the new church, and
have money in reserve. The club will
express to those who so ably assisted
on the program their appreciation of
services rondored in their own ideal way.

MINING NEWS.
Jose Gulch. — This property at
Butte City has been idle for several
weeks, pending the straightening out
of the title. W. E. Stewart, who has
been instrumental in getting the pres
ent company to take hold of the mine,
and who has tho management of it, has
succeeded in getting the title in proper
shape. At the meeting of the directors
eariy next month, it is believed that
everything will be adjusted, and mine
and mill resume operations. A run of
the mill was made last month, with
what output we are not informed, ex
cept that the rock is said to have more
than paid expenses.
Kennedy.— lt is pleasing to report
that this big mine has been on a divi
dend paying basis for several months.
With the completion of the mill a large
element in the running expense account
has been dispensed with, and the era
of dividends has again arrived.. Sev
eral monthly dividends have been paid.
The Staples' Case.
Little can be added to the statement
made in the Ledger last week relative
to this notorious case. Sheriff Norman
has written to deputy Kay, saying that
he would not bo home for ton or twelve
days. This was last Thursday, so the
time will be up about the last of the
month. The sheriff was then in San
Diego, attending to some other busi
ness-there while the papers in tho
Staples case were traveling through
the tediously slow process of Mexican
red tape. Nothingwas said to account
for the delay, other than the slowness
of the officials of the southern republi
can. Business that might easily be
transacted in a few hours, required as
many days to complete. The sheriff
would have to return from San Diego
to Ensenada for his prisoners, and as
the steamer plies between those points
every ten days, in the event of the
extradition papers not being fixed up
as anticipated, it would probably in
volve another stay of over a week.
However, Sheriff Norman is expected
to be home by the end of the month,
unless something unforeseen happens.
We may also say that the sheriff's trip
to Mexico is on state business. The
state will bear all the expenses of the
extradition of the two. accused persons,
Dr. Staples and Mrs. Haxie. All the
negotiations are between the state of
California and the Mexican authorities,
and the sheriff of Amador county is the
executive officer representing the state,
and not merely Amador county in this
transaction. Tho bill of costs there
fore is a state and not a county charge.

Nevills Mining and Ranch Interests to be

The S. F. Chronicle of Tuesday says
that a large part, if not all tho hold
ings of W. A. Nevills, ' the well-known
mine operator, in mines in Tuolumne
county, and vineyards in Fresno county,
are to be sold under foreclosure, to
satisfy a claim'ot over $200,000 hold by

loaned to Novills, and to secure which
the latter deposited collateral in stock
in the Rawhide and App mines, also
Guild Gold Mining Co., in Tuolumne
county, and share of Paragon and La
Favorita vineyard companies in Fresno
county. The securities are said to rep
resent a value of two million dollars.
Tho Union Trust Company, as executor
of the will of Chas. Doe, gives notice of
the sale of stock at auction to satisfy
the indebtedness. Captain Nevills,
when asked by a reporter about the
matter, said that he intended to settle
the debt in a few days, and that a pub
lic sale of his interests would not be
necessary. He also claims that by a
verbal understanding tho money was
to be repaid in Docember, 1903.

The above entitled war drama was
given in Plymouth by local talent on
the evening of the lßth, and is said to
have been one of the most creditable
performances ever witnessed on the
Plymouth stage. Sevoral of the lead
ing characters were old-timers at the
.business, and they maintained, their
already enviable reputations. To make
special mention of any particular one
without mentioning all would be im
prudent, for each and every one did his
or her part well. The vast audience
at various times were visibly affected
by the thrilling scenes as portrayed by
the actors. Many old veterans as well
as tho ladies were moved to tears. The
Blue and the Gray tenting together on
the old camp ground was a scene that
will not soon be forgotten. The entire
management was left to Dr. W. A.
Norman, who by his determination and
energy made failure an impossibility.
Being an artist of known ability he
spent days in painting special scenery
for the occasion. The ladies of the
Catholic church wish to extend to him
their heartfelt thanks for his untiring
efforts. Shields' hall was taxed to its
fullest capacityto hold the seemingly
myriads of people who had come from
everywhere. Prominent vocalists from
other towns assisted during the even
ing, and their efforts were, greatly ap
preciated by all present. Over $100
remains in the fund after all expenses
have been paid.

Killed in .the Keystone.
Coroner G. M. Huberty was called to
Amador City yesterday, to held an in
quest over the body of a young Italian
named Batiste Gracadi, who was killed
in the Keystone mine that morning.
It appears the victim was working in
the 500 foot level, attending ohuck . A
mas* of rock slid from above, inflicting
injuries from which he died in a short
time. Another miner was working
only a few feet away when the accident
occurred. He was 26 years of age, a
native of Italy, and leaves no relatives
in this county. The jury found a ver
dict of accidental death, exonerating
the company from all blame in the
matter. •
79th Birthday.
Mrs. Elizabeth Stasal, one of the old
est residents of Jackson, celebrated her
7i)th birthday on Sunday, the I:2th
inst., in a most appropriate manner.
Her daughters prepared a feast royal,
and invited many of their German
friends to spend the day with them.
Only the German language was spoken
during the day. The lady forgot her
age for the time being, and was appar
ently one of the youngest persons

To Test a Tax Title.
The case of J. Nicholaus vs. B. Nich
ley, which occupied several days of last
week in the superior court of this
county, is one of much importance. It
involves the validity of a tax title from
the state of California under the present
law concerning the sale and disposition
of property sold to the state on account
of delinquent taxes. The property
affected is in the vicinity of Plymouth.
Nichley was the owner. In 1897, - the
taxes being unpaid, the property was
sold to" the state, with other delinquent
property of that year. After a lapse
of five years, as the law provides, the
parcel remaining unredeemed, a deed
was issued to the state for the same.
This was a formal. and ex-parto pro
ceeding; no notice being required to be
given the former owner. In 1903 John ,
Nicholaus petitioned to have the prop
erty advertised for sale at public
auction, and the authorization of the
controller was given for that purpose.
The advertisement was duly published
in the Ledger, and at the sale the
plaintiff became the purchaser, at the
price of all the delinquent taxes for sev
eral years, with penalties, costs and in
terest added. In all the proceedings
the provisions of the law were, closely
adhered to. Nicholaus got his deed.
The original owner was not named nor
notified in any way; the law does not
make any provision therefor. The
presumption is that the owner of prop
erty must know whether he has paid
taxes regularly or not; if he 'neglects
to pay, he thereby voluntarily takes
all the risks incident to such neglect.
After the plaintiff got possession, Nich
ley, the former owner, set up some
claim. To settle the matter definitely,
Nicholaus brought suit to quiet title.
It is claimed that the case is of state
wide interest, as upon its determination
rests all property sold by the state
for delinquent taxes. C. H. Crocker is
attorney for plaintiff, and A. Caminettl
for defendant. The matter was argued
and submitted last Saturday. It is
likely that whichever way the case is
decided, on account of its importance,
it may be appealed to the supreme
court.

The Works at Electra.
A large number of men are employed
in cement work for the support of the
new pipe line. Massive piers at a dis
tance of a few feet apart are built for
the support of the pipe, each joint of
which in itself weighs five tons, to say
nothing of the strain it will be subject
to under the immense pressure of 1700
feet when in use. The pipe will be not
only supported underneath, but anchor
ed in the most substantial manner.
The pipe line is not quite completed,
although the pipe itself is about all on
the ground. One piece of machinery
for the plant passed through town a
few days ago that attracted much at
tention. It consisted of the gate to
operate the flow of water for the new
line. It is a ponderous piece of ma
chinery in itself, weighing seven tons.

BUYING RUBIES IN BURMA.
Grips and Signs Used In Bargaining
For Precious Stones.
The peculiar business methods of ori
ental merchants are illustrated by the
manner of buying rubies in Burma,
says the Jewelers' Circular-Weekly. In
the examination of rubies artificial
light is not used, the merchants! hold
ing that full sunlight alone can bring
out the color and brilliancy of the
gems. Sales must therefore take place
between oa. m. nd 3p. m., and the
sky must be clear.
The purchaser, placed near a win
dow, has before him a large copper
plate. The sellers come to him one by
one, aud each empties upon this plate
his little bag of .rubies. The purchaser
proceeds to arrange them for valua
tion in a number of small heaps. The
first division is into three grades, ac
cording to size. Each of these groups
Is again divided into three piles,-ac
cording to color, and each of these
piles is again divided into three groups,
according to shape. The bright copper
plate has a curious use. The sunlight
reflected from it through, the stone
brings out with true rubies a color ef
fect different from that with red spi
nels and tourmalines, which are thus
easily separated.
The buyer and seller then go through
a very peculiar method of bargaining
by signs, or, rather, grips, in perfect
silence. After agreeing upon the fair
ness of the classification they Join
their right hands, covered with a hand
kerchief or the flap of a garment, and
by grips and pressures mutually un
derstood among all these dealers they
make, modify and accept proposals of
purchase and sale. - .
HYPOCRITE AND VILLAIN.
The Gentle Terms a Playgoer Once
Applied to Forrest.
A number of professional men were
exchanging reminiscences of Edwin
Forrest the great tragedian. One of
them told the story of Forrest's experi
ence in the west which was not only
of Interest in itself, but also a tribute
to the art of the actor.
The play was "Vlrglnlus," and For
rest was at his best In the scene
where lie slays his daughter the audi
ence was almost stricken with awe,
and not a sound was heard until the
scene was concluded, after which the
artist was greeted with overpowering
applause. In the following act Virgin
lus comes on the stage looking worn
and distracted. The reaction has set
In, he is frenzied over the loss of his
daughter, and be walks up and down,
crying out: "Virginia, Virginia! Where
Is my child?"
An old miner, who occupied a front
row in the orchestra and who had been
terribly wrought up by -the murder
scene, could stand this no longer and,
arising in his place, shouted out in
loud tones, freighted with intense In
dignation: < '■ .'
""Why, you old villain, you killed her
in the market house In the last act
You know It well enough. You are a
hypocrite as well as a villain."
The laughter and applause that greet
ed this unexpected turn in the per
formance made it necessary to ring
down the curtain.— Harper's Weekly.
The Blameless One.
Mrs. Colburn removed her outer gar
ments and seated herself with a thud
In her rocking chair in the front win
dow. "I declare, I never saw such a
gadder as that young woman the min
ister married in all my life!" she said
Jerkily as she ran her darning ball
down Into the heel of Mr. Colburn's
gray stocking.
"I can't go over to Mis' Deacon
Graves' of an afternoon or down to
the store in the morning that I don't
either find her there or see her, coming
or going, three times out o' five!
"She's an awful starer, too," contin
ued Mrs. Colburn, pulling at a knot in
her darning cotton till it broke and her
elbow flew back against the sharp edge
of the table. "I can't look over at her
front window but what she turns her
eyes this way inside o' five minutes.
Don't sit there looking so numb, Wil
liam! Can't you see I've half killed
myself? Fetch me the liniment, quick!"
—Youth's Companion.
Not Humility of Spirit.
A young preacher In an uptown
church was much struck one Sunday
by the seeming effect his sermon was
having upon one of his congregation, a
shabby genteel man with white hair
who throughout the entire 'discourse
sat with head bowed in deeply reverent
attitude. After the service the min
ister pushed his way to the man and
proudly said:
"I am glad to note that my sermon
affected you. Did it make you see the
error of your ways?'
"Oh, It wasn't that," said the man
sheepishly. "You see, my waistcoat is
too short, and I had to bend over to
hide my shirt"— Cleveland Leader.
A Tranp'i Problem.
A tramp having found a hen's feath
er In bis travels about the city kept it
until night, when he carefully placed
It on the pavement in a back alley and
slept upon It. Awaking next morning
and looking scornfully upon the bit of
Sown, he exclaimed: "Gee whiz! If
one feather is as hard to sleep on as
that, what must a whole bedful be?"
What's In a Nome.
"Maybe I have an ugly color, as you
say," said the carrot to the beet, "but
when I am gone I hope some one may
say a good word for me. It seema.to
me a dead carrot has a better chance
for respect than a dead beet" And the
beet turned even redder In the face and
had nothing more to say.

HARD TO IMITATE.
Sounds Beyond the Ability of Our
Vocal Organs.
"That man can imitate perfectly the
Jingle of money," said in a tone of eu
logy a young woman. . ■
"Well, what of that?" objected her
companion. "That ought not to be
hard to do."
"Try to do it"
The objector, after summoning into
his mind the sound of jingling money,
tried. "R-r-r-tat-tat," he went. "Br-br
bra-ra-ra, chk-chkk-chk." Then he
smiled apologetically, for he had failed.
Not by the furthest stretch of the im
agination could It be said that he had
uttered a sound that resembled mon
eys jingle in the least degree.
"I knew you couldn't do it," said the
young woman. "It is amazing how
many simple sounds there are that we
can't imitate, try as we will. There is,
for instance, the sound of a person
walking, the sound of a typewriting
machine in operation, the sound of run
ning water," the sound of a .breaking
dish. Yon can't Imitate those com
monplace noises, and I doubt if any
one in the world can. Our vocal ca
pacity seems to us large, but it is real
ly limited enough— as limited as that
of many animals and much more lim

THE ALBATROSS.
Wonderful Flights of This Great
Feathered Wanderer.
Of all the strange creatures seen by
travelers not the least interesting is
the wandering albatross. This great
feathered wanderer, sometimes meas
uring seventeen feet from tip to tip of
his wings, will follow a ship for days
at a tune. Some travelers and sailors
declare that they have seen a particular
bird fly for weeks at a time without
resting. The albatross has always
been a bird of mystery, and in ancient
times the people believed that these
unwearying sea birds were the com
panions of the Greek warrior Dloinedes,
who were said to have been changed
Into birds at the death of their chief.
Though the superstition about the
killing of an albatross bringing bad
luck Is only a foolish one, it has served
a useful purpose for many years in pre
venting the slaughter of these beautiful
and gallant birds— the sailors' friends
and the landsmen's wonder. Up in
dreary Kamchatka, that outlying part
of Siberia which cuts into the north
Pacific, the natives, never having
heard of the superstition about the
albatross, catch him and eat him, but
his flesh makes such poor food that,
after all, the legend may be said to
hold good, for he Is indeed in bad luck
who has to make a meal of it— Ottawa

SOLON OF ATHENS.
His Definition of the Most Perfect
Form of Government.
"What is the most perfect form of
government?" was once propounded
at the court of Perlander, king of Cor
inth, one of the seven wise men of
Greece. His six fellows were present,
and of them Bias answered first, giv
ing as his opinion, "Where the laws
have no superior." Thales of Miletus,
the great astronomer, declared, "AVhere
the people are neither too rich nor too
poor."
In his turn said Anacharsis, the
Scythian, "Where virtue is honored
and vice detested." Said Pittacus of
Mitylene, "Where dignities are always
conferred upon the virtuous and never
upon the base." Said Cleobulus,
"Where the citizens fear blame more
than punishment" Said Chllo, the
Spartan, "Where the laws are more re
garded than the orators."
The last to reply was the youngest
but wisest of them all, Solon of Ath
ens, who said, "Where an injury done
to the meanest subject is an insult to
the whole community."— London Tele
graph.
His Glasses.
He was wearing his first pair of
glasses, and at first they afforded great
relief, but at the end of a month there
was a retrogression! Somehow, polish
the lens as he would, the vision ap
peared to be weaker. So he went back
to his oculist and said he thought the
glasses "weren't strong enough."
The oculist stepped aside for a min
ute, then handed his customer what
apparently was another pair. Trying
them drew forth the exclamation:
"Why, these are much better! I can
see now as well as when I first wore
my glasses."
Then he was Initiated into one of the
little secrets of the trade. The oculist
had merely cleansed each lens with a
little soap and water.— New York Post.
Developed Genius.
Lady— Do you think that your in

I used to stay late at the club, and my
wife cross questioned me severely
whenever I came home late. The ne
cessity of Inventing fresh excuses tax

became so abnormally developed that
as soon as I turned it to business'ac
count I made a fortune with ease. '

DINING IN JAPAN.
If It's Yonr First Japanese Meal Too
Will Dave a Trying Time.
If it's your first Japanese dinner
you're having a dreadfully hard .time.
In the first place you must sit on the
floor, for they don't have any chairs in
Japan. You kneel down, and then you
turn your toes In till one laps over the
other, and then you sit back between
your heels. At first you are quite
proud to find how well you do it, and
you don't think it's so very uncomfort
able. But pretty soon you get cramp
ed, and your legs ache as if you had a
toothache in them. You don't say any
thing, because you think that if the
Japanese can sit this way all day long
you ought to be able to stand it a few
minutes. Finally both your feet go to
sleep, and then you can't bear it a
moment longer, and you have to get
up aud stamp around the room to
drive the prickles out of your feet, and
all the little dancing girls giggle at
you. This isn't your only trouble ei
ther. All you have to eat with is a
pair of chopsticks, and you're in terror
lest you spill something on the dainty
white matting "floor. Now the floor of
a Japanese house isn't just the floor;
it's the chairs and sofas and tables
and beds as well. At home it would
be mortifying enough to go out to din
ner and spill something on the floor,
but in Japan, where people sit and
sleep on the floor, it seems even worse.
So you are unhappy till your little ne
san (who is the waitress and almost
as prettily dressed as the dancing girls,
but not quite) comes laughing to yOur
aid and shows you how to hold your
chopsticks. After that you manage
nicely the rice and the omelet, but the
fish and the chicken you can't contrive
to shred apart without dropping your
chopsticks all the time. So between
dances the maiko— the little girls about
twelve years old— kneel down beside
you and help you. They can't keep
from giggling at your awkwardness,
but you don't mind; you just giggle,
too, and everybody giggles and has a
love.ly time.— St Nicholas.
LOST IN THE AIR.
Birds at Times Get Confused anil
Lose Their Bearings.
Boys are frequently lost in the woods,
and it is a singular fact that birds are
sometimes lost in the air. This might
seem strange to almost any one, but
the average man is a superficial ob
server of little things. :
In the far north, and particularly
along the ocean coasts, birds are fre
quently storm driven and lose their
bearings, so that many of them are lost
at sea. They keep floating in the air,
aimlessly striving to live until exhaus
tion compels them to drop into the an
gry waves, which engulf them.
There is a well authenticated case on
record of an ocean liner bringing Into
New York on a winter's day a large
white owl which had dropped to one
of the forward spars in an exhausted
condition more than 800 miles off the
coast of Newfoundland. It was near
ly dead from cold and hunger and al
most too weak to eat anything. It had
become much emaciated and trembled
in Its distress when it tried to swal
low the first morsel of meat which was
placed within its beak. The captain
and sailors were all interested in it,
and under their nourishing care it
slowly recovered and became entirely
well and healthy antl strong. It will
ingly remained with the ship after
ward.
It was evidently a land bird which
had been blown off from the coast of
Newfoundland by strong west winds,
had become lost, merely drifted be
fore the gales, kept out of the water,
almost starved to death and made ita
last Intelligent effort to reach the ship
and there fell in exhaustion and col
lapse.
Old sailors narrate many other In
stances of finding birds that have been
lost In the air.— St Louis Republic.
Xo Panpcrx In Jrpiiii.
With all our high wages and boasted
civilization the fact remains that you
will see more wretchedly poor in any
of our great cities in a day than you
will see in Japan in a lifetime. In
other words, you will see no destitu
tion in Japan. Though some aro very
poor, yet all seem to be well fed, cloth
ed and housed and aro invariably
cheerful and, what is more surprising,
invariably clean. There are no paupers
in Japan and therefore ng workhouses
or poorhouses, though there 'are many
hospitals where the sick are healed
gratuitously. Practically every one can
earn a living. Would that we could say
the same!— Pall Mall Gazette.
Duet and Consumption.
Dusty work seems to be responsible
for consumption to a marked degree.
In 2,161 cases of consumption treated
at the sixty institutions of the Ger
man empire 1,005 patients had been
employed in a dusty environment The
kind of dust was not stated in 431
cases; In IS2 cases it was metal dust;
In 129, stone, coal or glass dust; in 116,
wood dust; in 111, wool dust, and in
126, various other kinds of dust.
He Hmd Use For It.
"Now, sir," began the agent, "this
book"—
"Ain't got no use for it!" snapped the
busy merchant
"Oh, yes, you have! Look at the title,
'The Art of Conversation and Correct
Speech.' "— Philadelphia Ledger.
Precedence,
"Don't you know, sir, that it is im
polite to swear before a lady?" The
Irishman looked dazed for a moment
and then replied: "Sure, mum, I hag
yer pardon. But Oi didn't know y*
■wanted to shwear first."
