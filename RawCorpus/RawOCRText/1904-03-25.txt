WEEDS
Consumption is a human
weed flourishing best in weak
lungs. Like other weeds it's
easily destroyed while young ;
when old, sometimes im-
possible.
Strengthen the lungs as you
.vould weak land and the
veeds will disappear.
The best lung fertilizer is
•cott's Emulsion. Salt, pork
■ > good too, but it is very hard
to digest
The time to treat consump-
t'um is when you begin trying
10. hide it from .....yourself.
Others see it, you won't.
Don't wait until you can't
deceive yourself any longer.
Begin with the first thought
to take Scott's Emulsion. If
it isn't really consumption so
much the better; you will soon
forget it and be better for the
treatment. If it is consump-
tion you can't expect to be
cured at once, but if you will
begin in time and will be
rigidly regular in your treat-
ment you will win.
Scott's Emulsion, fresh air,
rest all you can, eat all you
can, that's the treatment and
that's the best treatment."

TIMBER IN RIVER BEDS.
fortune Annltn the Inventor of •
Method to Recover It.
"If some, scheme could be devised,"
said a Stlllwater (Minn.) man, "by
which the sunken logs wlfich fill the
beds of rivers and creeks in the log
ging sections of this country could only
be recovered, immense fortunes would
be made. Along the St. Croix waters it
Is estimated that logs enough are im
bedded in .the sand of river bottoms to
keep mills running for yeara Under
present conditions the loss is total, for
no successful method has ever been de
vised to effect this saving.
"Occasionally logs cut years ago are
forced by the washings of (loeds from
their sand beds and driven upon the
shores, where the action of sun and
wind dries them out sufficiently so that
they : will ' float down ■ stream, but the
percentage of logs recovered Is small,
and millions of dollars' worth of prop
erty is lost beyond recovery until some
enterprising genius invents a machine
or process to recover the timber.
"At Stillwater logs 'occasionally come
to the sorting booms bearing marks In
use half a century ago, and when they
appear the old lumbermen grow remi
niscent of men who have been long
forgotten, but who were important
operators in the pioneer logging days
of Wisconsin and Minnesota.
• "No possible estimate can be made
of the amount of timber thus lost, but
lumbermen estimate that the rivers of
Wisconsin, in the value of 'the logs
buried in their sands, have fortunes of
millions of dollars if the logs could bo
recovered. . Wisconsin has been one of
the big pine states, and your Chip
pewa, Wisconsin, St. Croix and Me
nominee rivers and their tributaries
contain fortunes in sunken timber.
"Strange as it may appear, the value
of the timber is not lessened, even after
Jt has been submerged for half or
quarter of a century.. Efforts have been
occasionally made to recover sunken
logs. At one time a company was or
ganized at Stillwater to dredge streams
an{l thus recover some of the timber,
but the plan did not work with any
great degree , of success, this method
being found too expensive. Some one
will come along some clay with a plan,
and this immensely valuable product,
now lost, will be reeovered-'^-Slilwaii'

There never was a person who did

Brain.
The brain is an . important organ,
serving as *it docs to keep the bead
from collapsing. Almost all styles of
doing the hair call for a head of some
sort. Again, there is nothing like a
head to set off a fine neck. Finaljy., w.p
should feel ' rather foolish without our
heads.
For a long time scientists were una
ble to discover why it is that the brain
is divided into white and gray matter.
It remained for a clever French savant
to solve the difficulty.
"Quite likely," said he, "the loud col
ors had not yet come in when man was
created."
Psychology deals with the organic
aspect of thought To psychology we
owe the knowledge that calf's brain
makes good soup.— Puck.
Sir Colin Campbell's Commission,
When the Duke of Wellington was In
India he "discovered" the soldier who
afterward became Sir Coliu Campbell.
That dashing warrior was in the com
missariat service and had volunteered
for an assault on a hill fort. The duke
saw a little round man run up a ladder
and, receiving a pike thrust at the top,
rpll down like a ball tp the bottom. II(
was, however, up again in an instant
and, running up like a squirrel, was
the first or among the first in the place
The duke laughed, inquired about him
and procured him a commission.

TRIBUTES TO WIVES
WORDS OF TENDERNESS UTTERED
BY GREAT MEN.
The Homage That Tom Hood Paid to
the Partner of. Ills Sorrows -and
Joys— Jean Paul UK-liter's Unstint-
Ed Praise of Caroline Mayer.
Few great men have paid more t>n<
thusiastic tributes to their wives than
Toui Hood, and probably few wlvea
have better deserved ;-.uch homage, says
the Chicago Chronicle. "You will
think," he wrote to her in one of his
letters, "that I am more foolish than
any boy lover, and I plead guilty, for
never was a wooer so youug of heart
and so steeped in love as I, but it is a
love sanctified and strengthened by
long years of experience. May God
ever bless my darling, the sweetest,
most helpful, angel who ever stooped
to bless a muni". Has there ever,' we'
wonder, lived a wife to whom a more
delicate and beautiful tribute wus paid
than those verses of which the burden
Is, "I love thee, I love thee; 'tis all that
I can say?"
"I want thee much," Nathaniel Haw
thorne wrote to his wife many years
after his long patience had won for
him the flower "that was lent from
heaven to show the possibilities of the
human soul." "Thou art the only per
son in the world that ever was neces
sary to me, and now I am only myself
when thou art within my reach. Thou
art an unspeakably beloved woman."
Sophia Hawthorne was little better
than a chronic invalid, and it may be
that this physical weakness woke all
the deep chivalry and tenderness of the
man. And he reaped a rich reward for
an almost unrivaled devotion in the
"atmosphere pf love and happiness and
inspiration" with which his delicate
wife always surrounded him.
The wedded life of Wordsworth with
his cousin, "the phantom of delight,"
was a poem more exquisitely beautiful
than any his pen ever wrote. Mrs.
Wordsworth was never fair to look
upon, but she had that priceless and
rarer beauty of soul which made her
life "a center of sweetness" tp all
firqund her. "AIJ that she has been to
me," the poet onco said in his latter
days, "none but^ God and myself can
ever know," and it would be difficult
to find a more touching and beautiful
picture in the. gallery of great men's
lives than that of Wordsworth and his
wife, both bowed under the burden of
many years and almost blind, "walking
hund In hand together In the garden,
with all the blissful absorption and
tender confidence pf youthful lpvers.
|t never needed' "the welding touch
pf ' a great sorrow" to make the lives
p,f Tait and his devoted
Wife "a perfect whole." Speaking of
her many years after §he had been
taken from him, he said, "To part from
ben, if only for a day, was a pain only
less intense than tho pleasures with
which I returned to her, and 'when?!
took her with me it was one of the
purest Joys glveu to a man to watch
the meeting between her and our chll
dren."
When David Livingstone had 'passed
his thirtieth birthday, with barely a
thought for such "an indulgence as
wooing and wedding," he declared hu
morously that when he was a llttU
less busy lie wpuld send homo an ad
vertisement for a wife, "prof era bly :■
decent sort of widow," and yet so un
consciously near was his fate that onlj
a year later he was introducing hit
bride, Mary Moffat, to the home he ha£
built, largely with his own bands, at
Mabotsa. From that "supremely hap
py hour" to the day when, eighteen
years later, he received, her "last falul
Whisperings'' at Shupanga, no man ever
had a more self sacrificing, brave, "de
voted wife than the • missionary's
daughter. In fact, they were more like
two happy, light hearted children ihyn
sedate married folk, and under the
magic of their merriment the hard
ships and dangers of life in the heart
pf the' dark continent were stripped of
all their terrors.
Jean Paul Richter confessed that he
never even suspected the potentialities
of human happiness until he met Caro
line Mayer, "that sweetest and most
gifted of women," wheu he was fast
approaching his fortieth year, and that
he hai| no monopoly of the resultant
happiness Is proved by his wife's dec
laration that "Mehter is the pnrest, the
holiest the most godlike man that lives;
• * * to be the wife of such a man
Is the greatest glory that can fall to a
woman," while of his wife Klchter
once wrote, "I thought when I married
her that I had sounded the depths of
human love, but I have since realized
how- unfathomable Is the heart in
which a noble woman has her shrine."
Out Went the Bandbox.
Lord Ellenborough, the great English
judge, was once about to go on circuit
When Lady Ellenborough said that she
should like to accompany him. He re
plied that he had no objection, provided
she did not Incumber the carriage with
bandboxes, : which were his utter ab
hprpenpp. purlng the first day's jour
ney Lord Ellenborough, happening to
stretch his legs, put his foot through
something below the seat He discov
ered that It was a bandbox. Up went
the window and out went the band
box. The coachman stopped, and th«
footman, thinking that the bandbox
bad tumbled out of the window> by
Spme extraordinary chance, was going
%a pick it up when Lord EHenborougfc
furiously called out, "Drive on!" The
bandbox accordingly was left by the
ditch side. Havjng reached the coun
try town where he was to officiate as
Judge, Lord Ellenborough proceeded to
array himself for his appearance in thd
courthouse. "Now," said he, "where'a
my wig— where Is my wig?" "Mj
lord," replied the attendant, "It was
thrown out of the carriage window."

A SAFE DIET RULE.
Bat the Smallest Amount, of Food
That Will Preserve Health.
How shall one determine how much
food to eat? Too much mystery haa
been thrown about this subject Let
your sensationß decide. It muet be kept
In mind that the entire function of di
gestion and assimilation Is carried on
without conscious supervision or con
currence. It should be entirely ■ unfelt
and unknown, excepting by the feeling
of bien etre which accompanies and
follows - its normal - accomplishment.
Satiety Is bad. It implies a sensation
of fullness in the region of : the stosa
ach, and that means that too much
food . has : been taken. The 'exact ' cor-^
rcspondence In a healthy animal ; be
tween'the appetite and the amount of
food required is extraordinary.'; As a'
rule, the meal, unless eaten very slow
ly, should cease before the . appetite Is
entirely satisfied, because a little time
Is required for the outlying organs and
tUtsues . to feel the effects of; the^food
that has been ingested. "If too little haa
been taken, it Is easy enough to make
It up at the next meal, and the appe
tite will be only the better and the food
more grateful.
No one was ever sorry for having
voluntarily eaten too little, while mil
lions every day repent having eaten too
much. It has been said that the great
lesson homeopathy taught the world
was this— that whereas physicians had
been in the habit of giving the patient
the largest dose he could stand, they
have been led to see that their purpose
was better subserved by giving him
the smallest dose that would produce
the desired effect And so it is .with
food. Instead of eating, as most peo
ple unfortunately do, as much as they
can, they should eat the smallest
amount that will keep them in good
health.— Roger S. Tracy in Century.
THE MINISTER'S WIFE.
■he Han Her Trials and Sorrows, bat
Also Her Reward.
The minister's wife exercises th«
statesmanship necessary to, maintain a
well ordered and cultured home on a
smal| l.ncouifr=ra hpme constantly un
der inspection by the whole parish.
She sets a fashion in becoming dress
which tones up the taste of many of
her parishioners whose husbands' in
comes are two or three times as large
as the minister's salary. She is the
pastor and the actual head of the too
numerous women's and children's.or
ganizations In the church, and she man
ages to keep most of thp Jealousies of
their leaders, from coming to the sur
face,. . She listens sympathetically to
the confidences of the young women of
the congregation," and the small wed
ding fees which occasionally fall Into
her lap are meager wages for all the
time and thought she has given and
the teas she has served to bring about
these weddings— services which her
neighbors may laugh at, but which are
the most delicate and valuable of all
ministries when they issue in happy
homes.
She knows the pains, the Joys and
the sorrows of motherhood, and she has
strcngthrwd the courage of many- a
shrinking wife faltering on the thresh
old of an unknown realm. When she
has closed the eyes of the. flarjlng of
her heart in. t,hp last sleep she goes
out tp cu'eor weary watchers by sick
beds and to give her silent sympathy
to mourners who will not be comfort
ed. She holds her queenly way in pov
erty, trial and not seldom under un
kind and unjust criticism, and as she
grows older a light radiates from her
•patient face which moves discerning
friends who otherwise would pity .her
to say, "Verily, ahe haa her reward I"—
Congpegatlonallst.
She Was Too Enthusiastic.
"Teaching to me," said an enthusias
tic young schoolmistress, "Is a holy
calling. To sow in the young mind the
seeds of future knowledge and watch
them as. {hey grow and develop is a
pleasure greater than I can tell. 1
never weary of my work. My thoughts
are only of"—
"I am very sorry," interrupted the
young man to whom she was talking,
"that you are so devoted to your profes
sion, Miss Clara. I had hoped that
some day I might have naked you— in
fact, I colled tonight— but I hardly dare
go on, in the light of what you"—
"You may go on, Mr. Smith," said the
young lady softly. "I nm a little too
enthusiastic at times perhaps."
She Hod to Forelve.
Mrs. Winks— Mrs. Ayreg mid her hus
band have had a dreadful quarrel just
because she gave him a h-tter to mail
and he carried it around In his pockets
for a week. Isn't it too silly of her?
Mr. Winks— Maybe that would make
you mad too. Mrs. Winks— Oh, John, I
wouldn't lose my temper over a little
thing like that. Mr. Winks— l'm glad
to hear you say it, my dear. I just re
call that I've still got, that letter you
gave me last Wednesday,—Philadel

Escaped Her Notice.
"How did you Hko the way the min

hotels for a night generally buy a cigar
or two before they leave town, and
they need some inspiriting literary food
besides. '^-..
If an advertising agent wants your
business advertised in a fancy frame
at the depot, pay him about 200 per
cent more than, it is worth and let
him put it there. When a man has
three-quarters of a secoqd in which to
catch a train he invariably stops to
read depot advertisements, and your
card might take his eye.

Advertise on a calendar. People
never look at a calendar to see what
day of the month it is. They merely
glance hurriedly at It so as to be sure
that your name is spelled with or
without a "p," that's all.
But don't think of advertising in a
well established, legitimate newspaper.
Not for a moment Your advertise
ment would be nicely printed and
would find Its way into all the thrifty
households of the region, where are the
farmer, the mechanic, the tradesmen
in other lines and into the families of
the wealthy and refined, all who have
articles to buy and money with which
to buy them, and it would be read and
pondered, and people would come down
to your store and patronize you and
keep coming in increasing numbers, and
you might have to hire an extra clerk
or two, move into a larger block and
more favorable location and do a. big
ger business, but of course it would be
more expensive— and bring greater
profits.— Detroit Free Press.
For Their Stomachs' Sake.
Sunday school treats must come round

The hand of a small boy wavered for
an instant over a plate of cakes before
he took one. "Thanks," he said, after
his momentary hesitation, "I'm sure I
can manage' it If I stand up."
Another boy, still smaller, who had
stuffed systematically, at last turned
to his mother and sighed: "Carry me
home, mother; but, oh, don't bend me!"
The average boy in Yorkshire knows
why he attends these feasts and does
not relish being furnished forth scan

who was glowering mysteriously. "Have

"No," said the boy. In an aggrieved
tone, laying his hand on his diaphragm.

HOW TO FOLD A LETTER.
Only a Small Percentage of Appli-
cants Know the Right Way.
"I see you have lots of applications,"
said the advertising manager to the
business house manager who had ad
vertised for a typewriter and book
keeper. [v:a«';£.
"From all over New England," said
the business man, jamming bis pockets
full. "But what some of the girls who
answer are thinking of I can't Imagine.
Here Is one girl who will come fifty
miles to take a place at $5 a week."
"Can you tell much as to their quali
fications by their letters?"
"Can I? Well, rather. For Instance,
there is the wirtlng; there is the spell
ing of the words; there is the way the
letter Is put together; there Is even the
way the letter Is folded. Ever think
that letters are folded so as to save
time nowadays?".
"No," said the advertising man. "Its
all I can do to get the stamps to put on
'em. My stenographer folds 'em ; all
right, I guess. How should it be done?"
"Easy enough, simple enough, but
folded wrong often enough," said the
business man sententlously. "If your
typewriter knows her business she
takes the sheet and folds It up from the
bottom toward the top, • leaving the
proper width for the envelope, then
over from right to left and from "left
to right— so. Then when your letter is
opened it is right side up. See?"
"I see," murmured the advertising
man. "And how many applicants fold
their letters that way ?"
"Oh, three or four out of a dozen,
perhaps. Quite a commentary on busi
ness as. she Is taught, eh?" remarked
the business man as he strolled away.—

FRENCH POLITENESS.
It Is Widespread, Oppressive and
Time Devouring;.
During one summer which I spent
among exclusively French people In a
hotel at Saint-Germain I estimated that
I lost quite twenty-four hours out of
each week saying good morning and
good evening to the men, women, lit
tle children and dogs about me. If you
encoiinter the same person twenty-flve
times in the same day, you must smile
rapturously, pause, at least shake
hands if you do not kiss, ceremoniously
Inquire how he or she is "going" and
ceremoniously bid him or her "an re
volr" at parting. Not only every man
and woman expects this, but all the
little children toddle up. to you^shake
hands and exact the same amount of
ceremony. Then every well regulated
French family has a dog that more
than likely occupies a chair and eats
off a plate beside you at the table, so
that it is considered churlish If you do
not also stop and tell the dog "bon
Jour" and "au revolr" a dozen times a
day, pausing to take the paw which he
is prettily taught to extend to you.
When the washerwoman brings home
your linen, there are at least five min
utes spent In ceremoniously greeting
and parting from her. In the operation
of receiving and paying for linen you
exchange "merds" and "pardons" not
fewer than ten tunes. Any other serv
ing person or tradesman who comes to
do business with you throughout the
day you similarly receive with "bon
Jour, monsieur," and "au revolr, mon
sieur," and you thank him and beg his
pardon as often as you can possibly
get the words into the length of time
he has to stay.— Harper's Bazar.

A WISE OLD FOX.
One Who For a Long: Time Clererly
Eluded the Hounds.
In common with other people who
have looked after fox coverts " I have
often been puzzled by the disappearance
of .well known foxes and have become
convinced that | the more j intelligent
foxes, after they have . been before
hounds several times, often turn their
wits to account to avoid being hunted.
In a small covert that I know well
there was always ■ a fox. A fine big
fellow he was. I have more than once
met him when taking an early ride aa
he : loped quietly homeward after .: his
night's foraging. He never seemed to
mind/being seen. When the season
opened he gave us one or two capita!
runs, on the second occasion only Just
saving his brush by scrambling into an
unstopped drain in our neighbor's terri
tory. After that he was never to be
found 'when hounds came. | Yet he was.
seen about as usual at other times. One
day when walking near the covert one
of the terriers, who knew all about
foxes, took a line to an old tree in the
hedgerow and began to whimper and
scratch at the roots. A careful exam
ination, showed nothing. The tree was
not difficult to climb. It proved to bare
a hollow trunk, and there, at the bot
tom, was my friend curled up fast
asleep. . His mask smiles on me aa I
write. After a seven mile point and
on a good scenting day he met his fate,

No Place For Icemen.
"I had letters to a prominent official
in Porto Kico," said a New York manu
facturer of artificial ice plants, "and I
went down to that island, thinking I
had a sure grip on a big thing. I made
an appointment by letter and on a cer
tain day and hour was ushered Into his
office, and we had no sooner shaken
hands than he turned to the attendant
and said:
'"Jose, bring the gentleman a fresh
glass of lemonade and see that it is
good and hot'
j "It was hot enough to melt a dog,
and I felt rivers of perspiration run
ning down my back, and when that
boiling hot lemonade was brought In I
knew that I was dished. So it turned
out I might have sold red peppers
or horseradish, but as for ice— they
didn't want any In theirs."
The Mammoth and the Mosquito
- What has come to pass in thousands of
years seems hardly credible. Primitive ,
man, a weakling in comparison to modern
man, was able to conquer the huge mon-
Sters of thousands of years ago, such as
the Mammoth, and to-day they are dead
forever; yet .the mosquito and fly have j
never been conquered. It is now time
for the scientist to devise methods for kill- "
ing the mosquito and fly, so that they will
fro to join the mammoth and the monster
lizards. The mosquitoes and flies are dan-
gerous enemies of man because they spread
contagion. The mosquito often carries the
germ of malaria with his bite. The house-
fly spreads germs of disease over our food.
These bacterial germs, ever hunting for
the weak spot, find a place in our blood,
and then we suffer from grip, catarrh, con-
sumption, or malaria.
Dr. R. V. Pierce, chief consulting physi-
cian to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, at Buffalo, N. V., says : "There
would be no grip epidemics, the germs of
consumption, or malaria would find no
place in the human economy, if the blood
were pure, if the lungs, heart and other
organs were fed on good blood. Poisons
should not be allowed to accumulate in the
body; to be safe it is best to take a gentle
laxative at least once a week." Such a
vegetable laxative as Or. Pierces Pleasant
Pellets contains nothing which could harm
the system.
For putting the blood in order, and as a
tissue-builder and tonic for those weakened
by coughs, colds, catarrh, grip, nothing will
build one up quicker than Dr. Pierces

icine made entirely of roots and herbs, ,

FRIDAY... ..MARCH 25, 1904
NOT COMMENDABLE.
An article appeared in the Cala
veras Prospect two weeks ago, pur
porting to have been written in
Jackson, and signed "A Working
Miner." The article is against the
candidacy of C. E. Clinch, a prom
inent resident of Grass Valley, who
is an aspirant for the houor of being
one of the two delegates to which
the first congressional district is en
■ titled to in the republican national
convention. The writer claims to
have been a former resident of Grass
Valley, and personally acquainted
with Mr. Clinch, who is admitted to
be able, intelligent, and above re
proach. But he happens to be, so
the writer states, the manager of a
company's stored and this fact is
trotted out as an unsurmountable
barrier to his candidacy. To send
a man holding a position of that
"kind would alienate the support of
the miners. It would amount to a
recognition of an unfair principle,
and would endangef the republican
success in the coming campaign.
,The Ledger does not believe the
communication was written by a
"working miner" of Jackson. An
anonymous communication attack
ing the elegibility of a candidate for
such a place, and published outside
his "home" county, can only be
viewed with distrust, and will have
little weight with republicans gen
erally. We do not know Mr. Clinch,
and would not have known of his
political aspirations had it not been
for this attack from an unknown
source. But the strange part about
it is that the article was republished
in full in the Sutter. Creek Record,
thereby endorsing the attack, and
making the additional charge that
Clinch is not an available man for a
national delegate because he was
formerly a democrat, and is merely
a half-made republican at the pres
ent time. He furthermore supplied
coin to put up a building occupied
by the Grass Valley Union — a dem
ocratic paper. But the most sig
nificant part of the Record's article
is the statement in conclusion that
Hon. E. C. Voorheis of Sutter Creek
is also a candidate for delegate from
this district, and ought to be se
lected. The Ledger, from motives
of home pride, and from personal
knowledge of the man extending
over many years, would like .to see
Mr. Voorheis receive the honor. We
cannot believe that the mention of
his name in a double-barreled tirade
of abuse of a rival candidate has
been made with his knowledge or
consent. Such raw political work,
such petty backbiting tactics, hurt
rather than help the cause they are
intended to serve. Knowing Mr.
Voorheis as we do, as a life-long re
publican, and a man of too much
self-respect to stoop to methods
tainted with unfairness, we sin
cerely hope this ill-advised and in
temperate work will not be held
against his candidacy by the repub
licans of the first district.
DELAYED FREIGHT.
The urgent need of improved
means of transportation of freight
to the mining towns has been signally
illustrated the past few weeks by
the conditions prevailing at Jack
son, and we presume other towns
along the lode. Just now the mer
chants are complaining on account
of the non-receipt of goodfe, owing
to the impossibility of getting them
hauled from lone. At the railroad
depot the congestion of freight is de
plorable. We are told that hun
dreds of tons of goods of all classes
have accumulated at the depot,
awaiting transportation to Jackson
and other towns. There are only
four teams hauling general freight
from lone to Jackson — three of Pic
cardo's aud oue belonging to C.
Dufrene. While these may be ade
quate to handle the business during
the summer months, or- while the
roads are in fair condition, they are
utterly inadequate at the present
time. The road is in such shape
from the continuous rains, that not
more than half a load can be
brought, and it takes three days to
make the round trip — double the
time that is required under normal
conditions. The effect of this state
of affairs upon the business interests
of this section may be readily
imagined. Some merchants have
had their goods lying at the depot
for the last two weeks, and there is
no telling when they can be hauled.
• Heavy freight like sugar, flour, etc.,
is delayed because of its weight.
One business house has 20 tons lying
at lone. Livery stables also find it
difficult to get grain find other pro
visions hauled. In fact there is a
general outcry in this respect. The
situation is so acute that some busi
ness men are talking of hiring
special teams to briosj up their
goods. There is Tittle prospect of
relief until the weather settles, and
the road gets in better condition.
In spite of the vast sums of money
spent on the road between here aud
lone, that thoroughfare to-day is in
a desperately bad condition. The
impression is now general that
unless a system is devised to secure
much better results for the money
expended than heretofore, it is im
possible to keep it in anything like
shape. The heavy traffic will wear
it out faster than the funds avail
able can keep it in repair. It is a
hopeless task, as far as permanent
improvement goes. We have spent
enough money on this road during
the past ten or twelve years to have
graded and laid the roadbed for a
broadgauge railroad. Of course,
while it is the only means of com
munication we have, we are bound
to do what we can to keep it up.
The people all over the county are
getting thoroughly tired of trying
to fill up such a seemingly bottom
less pit. The only relief is a rail
road to take off the heavy traffic
that neutralizes all efforts to main
tain it as a passable wagon road.
WARNING TO SCHOOL TBUSTEES.
School trustees of districts in ad
joining counties are being warned
against a smooth fraud who has an
encyclopedia which he misrepresents
to trustees as having been adopted
by the county board of education
and as he is a smoothe talker he has
succeeded in dupiug many trustees
into buying. As soon as he gets
their warrant he sells it to some mer
chant, being afraid to take it to the
county superintendent for fear his
scheme would beexposed. — Mariposa
Gazette.
Colds Cause Pneumonia.
One of the most remarkable cases of
a cold, deep-seated on the lungs, caus
ing pneumonia, is that of Mrs. Gert
rude E. Fenner, Shesays: "Thecough
ing and straining so weakened me that
I ran down in weight from 148 to 92
pounds. I tried a number of remedies
to no avail till I used One Minute Cough
Cure. Four bottles of this wonderful
remedy cured me entirely of the|cough,
strengthened my lungs and restored me
to my normal weight, health and
strength. Sold by all druggists.
How is This for Home Interests.
The Dispatch man visited Stockton
last week. He secured two or three
small ads for his paper from business
firms in that city. On his return home,
speaking of the alertness of Stockton
for business, he says:
Several of these enterprising men and
firms have become aware of the fact
that Amador county, possesses quite an
important element of trade, and are
making an effort to secure at least a
portion of it by offering inducements
that we think it would be to the ad
vantage of our people to accept.
This is certainly an eye-oporier for
the business houses of Jackson, who
are the main support of the local
papers. To accept advertising from
the outside is legitimate business. Ad
vertising space is a commodity to be
sold to whoever will buy, just the same
as the merchandise in a store. It is
the province of the local paper, how
ever, in its editorial columns to seek to
build up home trade. This policy is
dictated by every consideration of
loyalty and self-interest. To recom
mend in all seriousness that the people
of Jackson give their patronage to
Stockton in preferance to home indus
tries, is a sample of going back upon
"our people," which is rarely equalled
in California journalism.

We had the first thunder storm of

Thunder and lightning and then came
the rain. Talk about rain and rain

had struck in the Ledger rain gauge

Mr. Page of Defender, has been doing

Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign.
Take Scott's Emulsion /or it. For
weak digestion, for defective nourish
ment, for consumption, take Scott's
Emulsion. It restores flesh because .t
strikes to the cause of the loss.
A Neglected Opportunity.
The opening of the St. Louis exposi
tion draws on apace. As a county,
Amador has done absolutely nothing
to have her resources fittingly repre
sented at that great world's fair. Un
less a stir is made, and made quickly,
this opportunity will be allowed to go
by default, and such an outcome would
be a reflection upon our enterprise With
out a parallel in California. The
supervisors have made no step in this
direction, notwithstanding that the
subject has been repeatedly broached.
It is not too late to make a showing
even at this eleventh hour. Why not
get a move on. The following letter
addressed to J. B. Tregloan, who has
manifested much interest in this direc
tion, is published as a matter of public
concern:
' March 12, 1904.
Mr. John B. Tregloan. .
Dear Sir: .
Referring to our conversation re •
garding $150 nugget picked up recently
at Volcano in your county, it has oc
curred to me that if thl3 nugget could
be secured, it would make a splendid
item for our California Mining Exhibit,
and one which could be turned to good
account, not only for Amador county,
but for the state at large, as dispelling
the idea that the day of gold nugget
finding in California had passed. Im
agine a nugget labeled as found at Vol
cano, Amador county, such and such a
date. People would be attracted by it.
and the natural expression would be — "1
soe thoy are still picking up gold nug
gets in California"— and the conclusion
would be that Volcano, where it was
found, must be a rich locality.
If the nugget is sent to us we will re
ceipt for it, and I have no doubt what
ever but that it will be returned as
directed, but, of course, with such
specimens there is always a little appre
hension created by the possibility of
doubt as to its safety, and if the owner
considers there is any risk, the county
might very consistently buy it from
him, and send it to us to be displayed
as indicated. I cannot imagine any
thing that the county could do for the
same money that will result in greater
benefit by way of emphasizing its min
eral resources, and fixing the name of
Amador as a mining county on the
minds of thousands of visitors to the
World's Exposition.
If this nugget is secured as suggested,
it may be sent to us by express, ad
dressed California State Building,
World's Fair Grounds, St. Louis, Mo.
Very truly yours,
J. A. Filcher.

Do Yon Want Strength!
If you want to increase your strength
you must add to and not take from the
physical. In other words, the food that
you eat must be digested, assimilated
and appropriated by tho nerves, blood
and tissues, before boing expelled from
the intestines. Kodol Dyspepsia Cure
adds to the physical. It gives strength
to and builds up strength in the human
system. It is pleasant to the taste and
palatable, and the only combination of
digestants that will digest the food and
enable.the system to appropriate all of
its health and strength-giving qualities.

Address F. L. CREASON, lONE P. 0.
PARAMOUNT is one of the handsomest
horses in the state and his breeding is of
the very best. Those who raise colts by this
beautiful young horse can consider themselves
fortunate. A tougher, more hardy, or better
formed horse never lived. His sire "Old Alta-
mont" was the greatest sire of extreme speed
in his day, having seven in the 2:10 list. There
are but two or three of his sons in the State,
and Paramount out-classes them all in beauty
and breeding. Paramount's dam, Nancy, by
Engineer, son of the Great Electioneer, was a
beautiful mare with extreme speed but never
was raced,

months, resulting in such a demoralized
condition of the highways as to seri
ously interfere with travel for. so long
a period. We had eighteen days of
rain in February; we have already had
fourteen wet days in March. Such ex
perience is unique in the history of this
foothill section within the memory of
white settlers. No wonder freighting
and business interests generally have
been discommoded by this unprecedent
ed experience.
THE AMADOR LEDGER; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MARCH 25, 1904.
Died in the Hospital.
I. L. Godfrey, the well-known car
penter of Water street, died in the
county hospital on Tuesday last, after
a lingering illness, incident to extreme
old age. He was one of the old timers
here, having worked at his trade in
Jackson in early days. He went back
to the eastern states, however, and re
mained there a number of years, but
returned to California some twelve
years ago, and has remained in Jack
son ever since. He was one of the most
expert workers in wood that ever came
to the county. Samples of bis handi
work in the making of high class fur
niture are found in Jackson, which
testify to his wonderful skill in that
line. He lived alone in his bus'uioss
premises on Water stroot, and worked
at his trade until a few months ago,
when the infirmities of age so pressed
upon him that he was unable to take
care of himself. He then stayed at the
Globe hotel for some weeks, but finally
was persuaded to go to the hospital
about two months ago. His son, Dr.
F. H. Godfrey, of Bloomington, Illi
nois, came out to visit him the latter
part of January, and intended to take
him back to Illinois if his health would
permit. It was deemed unwise to at
tempt such a trip in tho depth of win
ter, so the son returned to the east,
hoping that he would be able to stand
tbe journey in the spring. The doctor
was notified of his death, and sent word
to give him proper burial here. The
funeral took place today, the remains
being interred in the Catholic como
tery, the deceased having embraced
that faith a few hours prior to his death.
Deceasod was a native of Maine, 85 years
of ago. He was a man of integrity,
honorablo in all his dealings, and was
highly respected by all who know him
for his many excellent traits of ohar-

Dwelling Burned.
The four-roomed dwelling house
recently built by "B. Previtali on
the Jackson Gate road, on a lot in
the Bright addition, was entirely de
stroyed by fire last night. The fire
was discovered about 10 o'clock. How
it originated is a mystery, but
the circumstances wear a suspicious
look. The place was unoccupied; no
stove has eyer been in th.c house siiico
its erection. The flames seemed to
shoot up all at once, and this fact is
significant considering the incessant
rains we have had, and tho consequent
wet condition of the building. It is
said that the srnoll of coal oil was
strong. A party was seen leaving tho
premises a short time before the fire
was discovered. The residence of J,
Coombs is within a few feet of the
premises, and it was all the fire-fighters
could do to save it from the flames. It
took fire several times, but determined
effort saved it. The Previtali place was
utterly destroyed. Wo have not heard
that it was insured. The loss is esti
mated at $500. There was a lien against
it for lumber bought from F. M. Whit
more for about $150.

KILLED BY A CAVE.
Manuel Acuna Struck by Falling Bock
in the Keystone Mine and Fatally
Injured.
A young man named Manuel Acuna
yielded up his life last Tuesday to the
perils incident to the avocation of the
miner, while working in the Keystone
mine at Amador City. The victim and
his fellow- worker, named Sherman
Clark, wore employed in shoveling
rock at the breast of the 500 level.
They started in on the shift abjout 7
o'clock, and nothing occurred to
awaken any. fear of danger until the
untoward accident occurred which
severed the two co-workers forever.
At half-past 1 o'clock a mass of rock,
estimated at two tons, fell suddenly
and without the slightest warning. A
piece weighing 150 pounds 6truok
Acuna, fracturing his right leg and
crushing the vital organs. His com
panion Clark was In ui.-i-d up slightly.
Help was at hand forthwith, and Acuna
was soon rescued from the debris, and
sent on top. He lived for about an
hour and half, and was conscious
almost to the end. Coroner Huberty
went over the. same afternoon, .and
held an inquest before the following
named jurors: O. E. Martin, H. D.
Calvin, Geo. C. Davis, H. F. Coster, J.
B.\ Bastian and S. C. Tuttlo. After
hearing the testimony, tho jury re
turned a verdict of accidental death,
exonerating tho Keystone Company
from all blamo in connection with the
unfortunate affair. Acuna's life was
sacrificed to the unavoidable perils
that beset the underground work of
the miner.
Deceased was a single man, 22 years
of age, and a native of Amador coun
ty, residing in the neighborhood of
Drytown. Ho was a member of tbe
miners' uuion of Amador City, and the
funeral was conducted on Wednesday
under the management of that organi
zation, the remains boing interred in
the Drytown comotery.
Died in Woodland.
A message was recoivod here yester
day that M. McCulchen, father of J.
McCutichun, died at bis homo in Wood
land yesterday. J. McCu.tphen went
down Sunday on account of his father's
serious illuosa. On his arrival, how
evor. tho old gentleman was much' im
proved, and he wont on to San Fran
cisco to purchase stock for the dry
goods department of his store here.
While there he was notified of a change
for the worso in the cqndition of the
sick man, and he hastened home, his
father, however, passing away before
his arrival. The funeral will he hold
in Woodland to-morrow, and J. Mc-
Cutchen is expected to return to Jack
son Sunday evening.

Miss Bertha Lucot of Jackson, has
been visiting Miss Rosa Tarn during
the week.
A. large company of young people
gathered at Armory hall St. Patrick's
eve, and Indulged in dancing until a
late hour, Music was furnished by the
home orchestra, which gave entire sat
isfaction to all present.
The republicans of this place are
talking of starting a Roosevelt club
soon,- with either Perkins or Pardee
for second place. fJi
. The county papers were full of con
vention talk last week, so we want to
give timely notice that Volcano will
claim. the right to name one of the
.seven delegates to which Amador coun
ty is entitled in the state" convention.
The eastern portion of the county, has
many enthusiastic republicans, and it
is just possible that any one of them
"might : be persuaded to accept tho
honor.";
Miss Katie Bund entertained the
New Century Club at the home of her
grandmother, Mrs. Benj. Ross, Friday
evening. The popular games of flinch,
bourse, whist, etc., interspersed with
phonographic selections, occupied the
early part of the evening. Fortune
telling by two young gypsy maids, re
cent arrivajs from the mother country,
was' 'most amusing and instructive.
Grandma Ross then led the company
to the dining room, where viands galore
were spread before them, and after a
long but vain effort to "clear the
boards" the usual good-bys were said,
and the occasion was a thing of the
past.
FISHING.
Good for the Ledger in taking the
100 trout fishing proposition to task.
By saying what you did, you no doubt
voiced the sentiment of 90 per cent of
the people of ' Amador county. "God
grave man dominion over the fishes of
the sea and the fowls of the air." The
word man means all men in this decla
ration, but a few of the nimrods of this
county, styling themselves "Game As
sociation," want to change this divine
proclamation to read "a few men."
Our statutes aro already pverloaded
with game and fish laws. Some are
good, and many otherwise. 75 per
cent of the people of Amador county do
not go fishing once in five years, and
when a family does go they should be
allowed to pull out all the trout that
are suckers enough to swallow their
hook. While on the fitter hand, mem
bers qf : 'game associations" gener
ally fish each season, and go in com
panies of from five to twenty persons.
Of cour-e, if this ordinance was passed
thoy would all continue to fish until
each one of the 20 members had JOQ
trout, or 2000 for th,e day's fishing.
Great projection this. Wouldn't it be
more business-like for these game as
sociations to buy a thousand-acre tract
of land, stock it with deer, elk, doves,
quail, etc., build a large reservoir, fill
it with trout, bass, suckers, etc., have
certain times when the members could
hunt, and enjoy themselves at their
own, expense, and let the dear good
people of the county have a chance, to
get a few of the doves and fishes they
are always trying to protect, (for them
selves.) We believe the supervisors
will legislate for the 90 per cent of their
constituents rather than the game as
sociations.
THE GLENN OR WHITMORE MINE.
After als days' crushing with the
little 4-stamp mill on this mine, we
were permitted to take into our hands
and examine with our dreamy eyes a
52 oz. gold brick that had been ex
tracted from about 75 tons of ore, It
seemed too good to be true, but the
foreman, . Mr. Robinson, assured us
that we wore not deceived, and said it
was only a repetition of the 15 days'
run made in February. Five men do
all the work, and it is the intention of
those interested to run the mill to its
fullest capacity until the water supply
gives out. This mine shows a largo
vein of pay ore from the summit to the
base of the hill, the rock at both ex
tremities assaying over $12 per ton.
The vein is increasing with depth,
going to show that with proper means
of development we will have a great
dividend producer right hero in Vol
cano. This is only one of many just
such mines in this neighborhood. One
fifth of the money spent in any one of
the prospects along the mother lode
would be sufficient to operate a divi
dend producer here. Heretofore when
a prospect has been started it has in
variably been superintended by some
one not familiar with the peculiar ledge
formation found in this locality, and
being unwilling to take advice, theory
prevailed instead of experience. And as
a result some properties that are
known to be valuable have been dubbed
"no good." If some . good company
could secure the Glenn mine, equip it
with a good ten or fifteen stamp mill,
let Mr. .Robinson have full control a.s
superintendent, it is safe to say that
within sis mouths those people who
have been giving us tho black -eye so
long would bo compelled to face about,
look wise and exclaim, "I knew it. I
have been expecting this for some time. ' '

The social dance given in White's

of the neighborhood. The music was
furnished by Taylor, Mann and Coba
rubia. At dawn all departed for their
respective homes in high spirits.
Last evening Miss Gertrude Brown
entertained a number of friends at her
home, who gave her a pleasant sur
prise in honor of her nineteenth birth
day. The evening passed off with
much merriment until about eleven
o'clock, when the hostess led the way
to the dining room, .where a dainty
repast was spread. After lunch the
party returned to the parlor and' made
merry till a little after midnight, when
the guests returned to their homes,
(through the rain that began falling
during the evening) wishing their hos
tess many pleasant birthdays. Those
present besides the hostess and her
family, were: Messrs. Kobt. Brown,

To Purchase Traction Business.
It is reported that the promoters of
the olectric railroad from lone to. the
mining belt have made arrangements
to purchase from D. McCall the trac
tion engine outfit used last summer,
together" with wagons and tanks,
horses, mules and harness, used in the
delivery of oil to the various mines.
The object is to secure the contracts
for hauling freight to the mines, which
contracts are now held by McCall, and
which would be turned over to tho
railroad company in the event of the
deal being consummated upon tho
completion of the railroad. These
freight contracts are an important item
of business for the projected road. By
this move the company secures the
freight business of the mines, taking at
the same time the expensive traction
outfit, which, however, can no doubt
be turned to profitable use in some
other direction .
Miss Minnie Angove left for San
Francisco yesterday for a two weeks'

MINING NOTES.
Gwin.— The damage to the mine
caused by letting the skip down the
shaft, resulting in the instant death of
Chas. W. Levensky, was repaired by
Sunday. Anew cable 2700 feet long
was brought up by express, and Sun
day morning the hoisting out of that
compartment was resumed. The dam- -
age amounted to something like 82700
for the cablo alone, as it is impractic
able to use an old cable after an acci
dent of that kind. The skip was also
battered up badly by contact with the
sump. It was repaired under the direc
tion of Garbarini Bros., and is still in
service. ' .'."?
Destructive fire at Preston.
Tuesday night a red glare in the west
was visible in Jackson for over two
hours, and those who noticed it were
of the opinion that it was caused by a
serious conflagration. Wednesday it
was learned that one of the buildings
of the Preston School of Reform at
lone had been destroyed by fire during
the previous night. The structure
was known as the Trades building
next in size to the main administration
building. The fire originated in the
furnace room; how it started we have
not learned. Heroic efforts were made
to stay its march, but in spite of all
that could be done the building was
entirely gutted. The loss is estimated
at $30,000. The disaster will badly
cripple the institution for a time, as all
the machinery and tools used in in
structing the boys in the mechanical
arts were contained in this building.

FREAK HOUSES.
D»<llinK« In Which 'Ladders Toulc
the Place of Stair-nays.
Years ago a story was told of a naval
officer, who wanted a house built to
please his own taste in "every detail.
He drew the plans himself, placed them
in the hands of a builder and instructed
him to see that they were carried out in
every detail. Then he went to sea for
v year's cruise. When he 'returned
home the house had been completed
with the utmost regard for the plans
and specifications left by the officer.
He was tnken through the first floor
and expressed the utmost pleasure In
everything he saw.
"Now," he said, "we will go upstairs
nnd see the second floor."
"Come right out this way where we
have a ladder," replied the builder. ;-,:>
The seafaring man was astonished.
He had planned the bouse with the
greatest care, but forgot to provide for
a stairway.
The story of the naval officer has
never had a certificate of genuineness
attached to It, but an actual case in
which a house has been built without
a stairway is on record iv Washington.
It finally became the home of the late
John Boyle, who was for many years
chief clerk of the navy department and
who died In 1854, leaving a large es
tate. The house In question stood on
the site now occupied by a brewery be
low the naval observatory. It was a
pretentious old mansion, located In
what was a very stylish section during
the days of the elder John Boyle, who
came to this country in the early years
of the nineteenth century. The record
is not clear as to why the house was
constructed without a staircase, but
there is no doubt about the fact-
Washington Star. '
GLOVES IN EARLY DAYS.
They Were Often Hade to Represent
the Man Who Wore Them, .'
In the early days everything was not
regulated for the people, as It is now,
by the government and the law courts.
Europe was still young then, and peo
ple had rough and ready means of deal
ing with one another, of buying and
selling or giving goods and property
and settling disputes. A glove, as it
was very close indeed to a man's hand,
came In course of time to be looked
upon as taking the place of the hand It
self, and sometimes took the man's
place and was made to represent him.
For example, to open a fair it was
necessary then to have the consent and
protection of the great lord in whose
country it was going to be held. Those
who -wished to open the fair would
come to the nobleman and petition him
to be present. He might be very busy,
or bored at the idea of having to go, yet
he would know that it must be opened
or his people would be discontented.
So he would say to the leaders of the
people: "No, my trusty fellows, I can't
open the fair in person, but I will send
my glove to do It. You all know my
glove. 'Nobody has one like it in the
country. It Is the one my lady mother
embroidered for me In colored silks and
sliver wire, and It has a deep violet
fringe. You can hang It above the en
trance of your fair grounds as a sign
that you are acting with my permis
sion. If any one disputes your right or
touches his master's glove I will attend
to him; that's alll" So the glove would
travel in state to open the f air.— St
Nicholas.
Old Time Carving Terms.
In an old number of a magazine is
sued more than a century ago we light
ed upon a list of different terms used
at "tableß of elegance" in the days
when Queen Charlotte came as the
bride of the young and handsome king.
From this list it would appear that
nothing In the way of game was to be
carved. The correct phrase was to
"cut up" a turkey, to "rear" a goose,
to "unlace" a hare or rabbit, to "wing"
a partridge or a quail, to "allay" a
pheasant, to "dismember" a heron, to
"thigh" a woodcock, to "display" a
crane and to "lift" a swan. Beef and
mutton were "carved," of course, and
the sporting men prided themselves by
using appropriate sporting terms when
the spoil of their morning's work made
its final appearance on the table.—Mod
ern Society.
Our Double Selves.
In a form of experience which is al
most as common as ordinary dreaming
we see that the semisomnolent self
possesses a faculty not always given
to the waking self. Compared with my
own waking self, for Instance, my half
asleep self is almost a personality of
genius. He can create visions that the
Waking self can remember but cannot
originate and cannot trace to any mem
ory of waking impressions. These ap
parently trivial things thus point to the
existence of almost wholly submerged
potentialities in a mind so everyday,
commonplace and, so to speak, super
ficial as mine.

he liked my Othello he said It was all

how he liked it he said he certainly got

Insanity and death result. Now, how
do you suppose they keep them from

THE" WINTER OF TB6l.
(•lilcnt of the Nineteenth Century la
New England.
The winter or 1801 was noted for be
ing one of the coldest, and, In fact, It
was the coldest one, in the century.
The coldest day of the winter was Fri
day, Feb. 25, and Is known as cold
Friday. There had been a heavy
storm of light, fine snow. It cleared
off cold, and the wind blew a perfect
gale, thus making tbe cold more fear
ful. The air was filled with snow so
thick one could see only . a rod or two
In any direction. Men who were oblig
ed to be on the road perished and were
found frozen as hard as marble statues.
A very few travelers survived the or
denl. But few had thermometers In
those days to tell how cold it really
was, but what few there were regis
tered 40 to 50 below zero in Androscog
gln, and in Aroostook county it was
even lower. Penobscot bay was frozen
over so solid that Sam Randall . of
Vanalhaven took a horse and sleigh
and, together with the Hon. Martin
Kiff, who was the representative to the
legislature from Vinalhaven. cruised
from Vinalhaven to North Haven, then
to Saddle island, then to Camden and
thence across country to Augusta,
where he left Kiff and returned to Vi
nalhaven again safely. Portland harbor
and Boston harbor were frozen over
solid. Thousands of the Boston people
availed themselves of the fact, and the
ice on the harbor was covered with
skaters. — Lewlston Journal. . ■
GRINNING MATCHES.
An Accepted Form of Sport In Early
English Days.
That grinning matches were an ac
cepted form of sport In early English
days is shown by an advertisement an
nouncing a gold ring to be grinned for
by men on Oct. 9 at the Swan, Coleshill
heath, in Warwickshire, which appear
ed in the Post-Boy of Sept 11 and 17,
1711, supplemented by the suggestion
that all the country fellows within ten
miles of the Swan should grin an hour
or two hi their glasses every morning
In order to qualify themselves for this
extraordinary competition. •- .
Addlson gives a detailed account of
one of these "controversies " of faces,"
telling us that the audience unanimous
ly bestowed the ring on a cobbler, who
"produced several new grins of his own
Invention, baring been used to cut
faces for many years together over his
last." .S
His performance was something like
this: "At the very first grin he cast ev
ery human feature out of his counte
nance; at the second he simulated the
face of a spout, at the third that of n
baboon, at the fourth the head of a
bass viol and at the fifth a pair of nut
crackers." Addison adds that a comely
wench, whom he had wooed in vain for
more than five years, was so charmed
With his grins that she married him the
following weefc,"the cobbler using the
prize as bis wedding ring.
UNDER THE ROSE.
The Term Which Stands as the Sym-
bol of Cloned Lips.
Sir T. Browne, In his "Inquiries Into
Vulgar Errors," dated IG4C, says of the
old phrase sub rosa, "The expression is
commendable, if the rose, from any
natural! propertie may be the symbole
of silence," and goes on to quote some
Latin lines which represent the rose
bud folded in its sheath as an emblem
of closed lips.
He also speaks of the secrecy to be
observed "in society and couipotatioh.
from the ancient custome in Syuiposi
acke meetings to wear chaplets of roses
about their heads."
Others derive the expression from the
fable that Cupid gave a rose to Har
pocrates, the god of silence, as a bribe
to prevent the disclosure of the amours
of Venus.
There are many records of roses
carved upon ceilings in early and In
more modern times as reminders to
guests that words spoken in convivial
moments should not be repeated.
It is said that in 1520 roses conse
crated by the pope were placed over
the confessionals iv Rome to denote se
crecy.
Face Powder In Cuba.
In Cuba there has never apparently
been any dearth of face powder even
among the lowliest. The Cuban wom
an, octogenarian as well as "swwt sev
enteen," considers powder a more neces
sary article of tlie toilet than soap and
water and utterly indispensable to her
attractiveness, which it is her absolute
duty to preserve. All classes of the
community are devoted to the powder
puff, from the little six-year-old orphan
in the asylum to the lady of high de
gree. In any Cuban school teachers
and pupils are alike unsparingly pow
dered, and a powder box is to be' found
In every desk and as likely as not keep-
Ing company with the chalk used for
the blackboard.
The Man In the Moon.
Probably even In prehistoric times
men have noticed the face of the "man
In the moon." Plutarch noticed it and
even wrote a whole book about the face
in the moon. But, besides this, many
other objects are supposed to be visible.
The dark markings on the surface are
likened by the Chinese to a monkey
pounding rice. In India they are said
to resemble a rabbit. To the Persians
they seem like the earth's oceans and
continents reflected In a mirror.
Addendum,
Kwoter— He thinks he's still youth
ful. Well, you know the old saying,
"There's no fool like an old fool."
Newitt— Yes, and when an old fool dyes

the old fool.— Philadelphia Press.

SETTING IN THE WALNUTS.'
Xn. Induxtry That Closes California
Conntry Schools.
The first English walnut orchard in
California was planted with seed from
;he Los Angeles mission gardens, where
the padres had started a few trees with
nuts brought with them from Spain.
The undertaking was a success from
the first, and the acreage of walnuts
has steadily increased. The walnut
tree's early age of bearing, its long life
md the steady demand "for its product
tend to make the enterprise deservedly
popular.
The walmlt tree begins to bear when
six or seven years old, and nothing Is
known definitely of its age limit of
bearing. Fabulous stories are told of
trees in Spain one or two centuries old
bearing enormous crops. The oldest
trees in California are still bearing, but
deductions from the short history al
ready made show that the tree Is In its
prime from its twenty-fifth to its thir
tieth year. Fifteen hundred pounds of
nuts to the acre is a good average yield,
naking seventy -five pounds the average
weight from one tree.
The harvest time begins about the
middle of September and lasts nearly
six weeks. The nuts begin to fall with
the leaves, and the perfect cultivation
under the trees leaves no chance for
them to lose themselves among clods
or weeds. The brown dead, leaves
ilone hide the nuts. Under normal con
ditions they drop free from the outer
husk, or hull, through its irregular
bursting, and getting the nuts picked
up is a simple matter. Sometimes the
trees are well Irrigated just before har
vest time to insure the clean dropping
of the nuts.
Boys and girls, men and women, Jap
anese and Chinese, are all pressed into
service, and on hands and knees the
great orchards are gone over, not once,
but several times, on account of the Ir
regular ripening of the nuts. The trees
are occasionally shaken during tbe sea
son to loosen the nuts, and before the
last gleaning they are "poled" to start
the very tardy ones. This is done by
long, coarse bamboo poles, whose light
weight makes them easily handled.
In certain rural districts the public
schools close regularly for a "walnut
vacation." The help of the children Is
needed, and the children are nothing
loath to replenish their diminished
purses. Fails, cans and gunnysacks are
scattered among the pickers, and when
the bags are full they are carried to
the drying grounds, where they are
spread out on slat trays to dry.—Re

Discontent With Work.
That there is much discontent with
work among the so called middle
classes In America Is due in large part
to the pampering of children, to the
supplying of their natural and artificial
wants and to the sentimental idea that
"their day of toll will come soon
enough." In general, work Is not a
curse, but a blessing— a positive means
of grace. One can hardly begin too
early to impress upon children lessons
of self help by tasks appropriate to
their age and forces and to beget in
them scorn of idleness and of depend
ence on others. To do this Is to make
them happy through the self respect
that comes with the realization of pow
er and thus to approximate Tennyson's
goal of man, "Self reverence, self
knowledge, self control."— Century.
Do It Now.
The following sentiment has been
variously attributed to Stephen Grel
let, Sir Rowland Hill, Edward Courte
nay and the Earl of Devon, and
la said to have been Inscribed upon the
tombstone of the latter: "I expect to
pass through this world but once. If,
therefore, there be any kindness I can
show or any good thing I can do to any
fellow being, let me do it now. Let mo
not defer It nor neglect it, for I shall
not pass this way again."
