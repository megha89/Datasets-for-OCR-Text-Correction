FOLLIES OF FASHION
SARTORIAL VAGARIES OF THE CEN
TURIES THAT ARE GONE.
Grotesque Styles Tbat Relffaed In
the Time of Chaucer — Raiment
That Rivaled the Rntnbaw and
Men Who Stnrched Their Bearda.
It Is a little gratifying to reflect that,
however the man of today may com
pare with his ancestors of bygone cen
turies In 'physique and morals, bis
dress Is much more moderate and in
expensive, even If it Is less pictur
esque, than theirs.
It Is true that here and there one
may find some foolish young man
whose tas^e in dress is as extravagant
as that pf any "buck" of the days of
the Georges. There is, for instance, a
son of a well known peer who has the
reputation of never wearing a suit
twice. ' He has a wardrobe of waist
coats of all the colors of the rainbow,
rapging from a light blue spangled
with silver stars to a deep green satin
with buttons of eighteen carat gold,
each of which Is adorned with the
painted face of a beautiful woman.
wealthy aristocrat is credit
ed with having as many B|ilts and uni
forms as there arii ila'ys."}!) tbeyeaf
and with spending on his tailor's bill
a sum which would pay the yearly
salary of a minor cabinet minister.
But such men are modestly arrayed
compared with the dandles of many a
past century. The earl of Northum
berland who lived in the latter part of
flip fourteenth pentury boasted no few
er than' sixty suits of plpth gf gold
alppe, and ' tlje bishop of Ely pf thap
time had a chapge of raiufent for ev
ery day of the year.
Much later. In Queen Mary's time,
the wardrobe of a bishop might have
been the envy of Solomon for the va
riety and costliness of its contents, and
even a simple village priest, according
to Pufler, wore "a vestment of crimson
satin, a vestment ot crimson velvet, a
stole and fanonset with pearl," ijtpwns
facptj.wfth taffetas, efc." •
In the days of Chaucer fashionable
men wore clothes as many colored as
Joseph's coat, so that "while one leg
would be a blaze of crimson the other
would be tricked out in green or blue
or yellow, without any regard to har
mohy or contrast."
Even as late as the middle of the
eighteenth et-ntury a dandy would deck
hlnitiflf in "a vivid green coat, a waist
coat of' scarlet, v«»Uow breeches an<J
blue stockings," and the gfutlemau of
a few years later wore, among simi
lar sartorial vagaries, "a coat of light
green, with sleeves too .small for the
arms and buttons too big for the
sIePVSS; 3 pair of Manchester fine stuff
breeches, without money (n their popk
ets; clouded silk stockings, a club of
hair behind larger than the head that
carries it a hat of the size of a six
pence on a block not worth a far
thing." ; v V
: 4.t one fasbjonable epoch our ances
tors, to quote the words of a quaint
chronicler, "would weare clothes so
tighte to ye skin that It might well be
ppneeived they wore no clothes at all,"
.and ot a&ojther they would wear them
"so' yolumiuoiis iliat a suite
might well have afforded r^ymentior
a whole famllie, and so stuffed out
with feathers that, of a verity, their
wearers resembled nothing so much as
walking sackes."
At ' another period I£ was the gro
tesque fashion to combine on one per
son the dress of all the countries of
Europe— the hat would be Spanish, the
coat French, the trousers Turkish, and
so on— so that the wearer was a "walk
ing epitome of the dress of a conti
nent" '"' .::,i
At one time shoes would be worn
with square toes of such width that a
royal proclamation was Issued limiting
the width to six Inches, and these
shoes were succeeded by others which
came to the finest of points at the toes.
In Henry ll.'s time shops with points
two feet long were worn by the fash
ionables, and in the reign of Henry
IV. these points had grown to such an
inordinate length that In order to be
able to walk at aJJ If was necessary to
attach the tips to the knees by chains,
which were of gold or silver, while the
tops of the shoes were carved with all
kinds of fantastic designs.
Jn £he early par* pf the eighteenth
century it was a common thing for a
man of fashion to spend several hours
a day with his valet among the many
quaint operations being "the starching
pf the beard and the proper perfuming
of garments, the painting of the face
and anointing with oils, tinctures, quin
tessences and pomatums.'" It Is even
said that some of the dandies of the
time bathed In wine and milk "for the
preservation of their complexions and
the rejuvenation of their energies."—

COSTLY PLATE.
Borne London Companies nave Old
and Interesting Services.
Few people,- at least In this country,
possess plate worth such a fabulous
sum as that owned by London's lord
mayor during his term of office. Its
face- value has been computed to be
slightly over £20,000, though three
times that amount would not buy it
owing to the historical interest attach
ed to many of the articles.
The two solid silver soup tureen <
which are employed at the banquet to
distribute 100 gallons of clear turtle to
the guests are valued at £300 apiece
and are said to have been in possession
of the corporation for over a century.
Moreover, there nre a gross of silver
dinner plates worth £1,500, 200 ice
pails valued at nearly £1,000. 200 en
tree dishes, the cost of which £2.000
would not coyer; 80 split) silver meat
dishes worth another £2,000, and hun
dreds of other articles, such as grape
scissors, salt cellars, wine cups, wait
ers' trays, decanter labels, etc., all of
solid gold or silver and valued at over
£5,000. !
Thig .collection of plate is constantly
being Increased, for' every lord, mayor
at the expiration of his term of office
is expected to add an Item, the cost of
whiph must not be lower than 100
guineas,,'" "
In addition the lord mayor's official
regalia Is costly In the extreme. The
diamond pendent that bangs about his
neck could not be bought for £1,000,
and his collar cost a quarter of that
sum, while his pearl sword necessitat
ed the corporation spending £900 when
It was new.
Buf fhe Other companies in the city
possess plate of even greater valup.
The Goldsmiths, for instance, own the
mpst priceless collection, the worth of
which It Is impossible to estimate. It
Includes Queen Elizabeth's coronation
cup, for which an offer of £5,000 was
refused some time ago. The Fishmon
gers' company boasts of, among other
things, a silver chandelier, and esti
mates of its value have never fallen

POINTERS ON MANICURING.
When the nails are fragile, a little
wax and alum rubbed upon them will
'strengthen them. If brittle, a little
almond oil or cold cream will be found
beneficial.
To jreinoye whifo spots from the nails
use'a mjx'ttire'of refiiied riitcli anil a \i%
jle myrrh uppn them at night, -wiping
\% off the nest uiorniug w|th olive oil.
When about to uiunictirp the bauds,
dip the fingers Into warm, soapy wa
ter and hold them there for a minute
or two in order to soften the nails and
the scarfskin about them.
The scarfskiu should be gently push
ed back from the nails before they are
polished. It should never unless abso
lutely necessary be ci* with the scis
sors.
Agnails, improperly called hangnails,
may be prevented by proper attention
to the scarfskin which sun-omuls the
nails.

wife and I are seated until sometimes
six persons are seated, in a space
scarcely large enough for four to sit
comfortably. Hats and wraps must
look out for themselves.
•(Qf course, when I go to the theater
I pay for my seat; but In spite of the
fact that salvation Is free, I also pay
pew rent in church. I might also enter

How Lamp Chimneys Were Invented.
Lamp glasses were invented by
Aime Argand, the Inventor of the fa
mous lamp apd gas burner which bears
his name. He had been experimenting
for some time in trying to increase the
light but to no purpose. On the table
before him lay the broken neck of an
oil flask. This he took up carelessly
and placed it almost without thought,
over the wick. A brilliant flame was
the result and the hint was not lost
upon the experimentalist who pro
ceeded to put his discovery into prac-
Hrai oDeratlon at once.

A woman, traveling abroad narrate*

a certain - spot, which shall be name

ever, proved to be away with his, wife
at a s»«tghboring health resort The
visitor nsked for the first secretary,
who, unfortunately, was on leave In
England. The woman said" that the
second wecretary would do as well, but

Be natural. If you are not what you

Visiting Cards In Sweden.
An old Swedish custom is for people
to indicate their business upon their
visiting cards. One will receive the
card of Lawyer Jones or Banker Smith
or Notary Johnsoq or Music Professor
Brown or Grosserer (which means
wholesale merchant) "Ferguson or Geol
ogist Thompson, and if a man ever
held an office it is customary to indi
cate that fact upon his card. A burgo
master is always a burgomaster, a con
sul is always a consul and an alder
man' aiways an alderman. The pre
fixes "Hon." and "Mr." are seldom
used, and the title, whether commer
cial or professional, is observed Iv con
versation in the same way.
It is customary also for ladies to
print their maiden names upon their
visiting cards In smaller type under
their married names, particularly if
they have a pride of family and want
people to know their ancestry.
Aniesttietloa In China.
A Chinese manuscript In the Paris li
brary proves that anaesthetics for sur
gical purposes were used In China
1,700 years ago. It states that when a
surgeon conducted a serious operation
be gave a decoction to the patient, who
after a few moments became as insen
sible as If he were dead. Then, as thf
case required, the surgeon performed
the operation — Incision or amputation—
and removed the pause of the malady.
Then he brought together and secured
the tissues and applied liniments. "Aft
er a certain number of days the pa
tient recovered without bavins expe
rienced the slightest pain during the
operation."
Baying and Selling.
"You advertised," said tl^e gullible

fakir pleasantly, "is that you have been

It has brought me success."— Chicago

When Time Hangs Heavily.
Time is never wasted until it "hangs
heavily on our hands," when you are
neither working nor enjoying yourself.
There may be times when It suits
one's mood to "loaf and invite one's
soul," but they are rare nowadays. If
you don't believe It consider how the
average citizen spends his vacation.
Most people work harder and econo
mize their vacation time more grudg
ingly In getting the most out of it than
they do in any other part of the year.
They hate to lose' a 'minute 'of enjoy
ment.

Hnge Spiders Wove Them.
Every one who owns a little strip of
garden knows what It is to clear away
spider webs, a matter of small diffi
culty and lightly performed, but v pop
ular naturalist who lately returned
from the great woods of Central Amer
ica came across spiders' webs of such
strength and huge dimensions that
they were positive obstacles in his
path. Needless to say, the tenants of
these webs were of a monstrous size.
"I measured one of these fabrics,"
be says. "It had a diameter of more
than sis feet without including the
long brace threads that run out like
forestays to the extremity of the sur
rounding branches. I then took a num
ber of wild lemons and flung them
against the center with all my might
The web stopped every one. It is no
wonder tbat when a bird becomes en
tangled In the meshes the huge spider
is able to make a breakfast off him."

/The traveler who happens to be
weather bound at Perugia may find
some amusement in the library of one
of the leading hotels. Among the con
tents of the shelves, there is a consid
erable sprinklipg of English books;
but, to the visitor's surprise, a large
proportion of these are by a mysterious
author, "Bart," of whose name he Is
probably ignorant But when he finds
that Bart has written "Jvanhoe" and
"The Last Days of Pompeii" the key to
the mystery is discovered. The local
binder" has taken the author's title for
his name, and Sir Walter Scott and
Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton are credit

Conscience Money.
''Conscience money" In Great Britain
now amounts to thousands of pounds
annually. The first sum noticed was
on March 30, 17S0, when £3GO was car
ried to the public account In conse
quence of a note received by the chan
cellor.- The writer with troubled soul
Implored him, "as an honest man, to
consider the money the property of the
nation and to be so just as to apply
it to the use of the state In such a
manner that the nation may not suffer
by its having been detained and thus
to ease the conscience of an honest
man." y- ' - : :

Cartons Freak of Insane Persons.
A Belgian physician, speaking of
simulation by the Insane, says that in
eases of Insanity where the intellectual
faculties are not too much disordered
the insane may simulate another form
of insanity than their own. The forms
of' insanity most often simulated are,
in order of frequency, imbecility, de
mentia and mania. The other forms
are not so frequently simulated. A
lunatic generally simulates insanity to
escape punishment and an expert phy
sician "should not therefore in such
cases be satisfied with a diagnosis of
simulation. Such diagnosis daes not
exclude real insanity, and the physi
cian should therefore endeavor to as
certain whether or not the simulator is
himself a lunatic. With care, patience
and a long continued observation it is
possible to make a complete and cor
rect diagnosis, and this Is the more lm
portant as in these cases the serious
question of responsibility arises.—Lon

Why Tomsk Waa Igmored.
A correspondent of an English paper
tells why the great Transslberlan rail
way does not run through Tomsk, the
capital. "How much will you give us
If we bring the line past Tomsk?" ask
ed surveyors and engineers who
mapped the route, "Nothing!" replied
Tomsk. "We are the capital of Siberia,
and you can't avoid coming here." "Oh,
can't we?" replied the route finders.
"If you don't produce so many thou
sand rubles, there will be Insurmount
able engineering dlfliculties that win
prevent us coming within a long way
of Tomsk." These engineering difficul
ties were discovered, and so the Trans-
Blberian railway sweeps along fifty
miles to the south of Tomsk, and a
branch line had to be made. • .><
Hopeless.
An English clergyman was address

order to appeal the more to his hearers

gating his craft through a dangerous
passage, surrounded with rocks and
currents, «nd he described the voyage
in detail. At last he reached his ell- '
max, when It seemed inevitable that
the ship should be lost "And what
shall we do now?" he made his captain
cry.
"Bless your soul, guvnor," replied a
voice at the back, "that captain o
yours can't do nothln'l He's sallln' his

R. WEBB .... Editor and Manager
FRIDAY JANUARY 17, 1902
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
We look to the friends of tbe Ledger to keep
us posted concerning events of public interest
happening in any part of the county. Our reg
ular correspondents will be furnished with
writing material and stamps for this purpose.
Births, deaths, marriages, accidents, amuse
ments, mining and other industrial progress,
social topics, new buildings, persons leaving
or ooming into the county, are always accept

matter in how rough a shape. Avoid personal
remarks that might give of ms«. Visitors be

county may be recorded.
A SAVORY RECORD.
The Webb gave good advice in last
week's issue of his Ledger, when he
advised people to trade at home.
How well he has followed his own
advice is known to all citizens.
Wherever he has been able to save a
cent by purchasing elsewhere, he
has let home tradesmen severely
alone. "Don't do as I do, but as I
tell you to do," should have been in
corporated in the Webb article.^-
Dispatch.
It is not the policy of the Ledger
to resort to offensive personalties,
after the pattern of the above. We
have lived long enough to know that
it is useless to try to answer an un
scrupulous liar. His field of enter
prise is boundless, and his conscience
interposes no barrier to the gratifi
cation of his malicious spirit. We
reproduce the above sample of his
ravings to show our supreme con
tempt for the opinion of critters of
his ilk. It is a mirror in which the
community may see reflected the true
image of his own little self. Tf it
pleases him to publish such stuff for
the gratification of his readers, it
affords us equal pleasure to tickle
his depraved nature still further by
extending the article to the still
larger circle of the Ledger readers.
But who is this that presumes to sit
in judgment upon the private affairs
of his betters? Is he not a refugee
from the valleys, driven by short
ness of fodder and stress of circum
stances to seek shelter with his
brethren in the mountains? He
sought to be a leader among the
faithful of his political tribe, and
managed to get himself elected as
the chief sachem thereof, and was
thereafter dropped like a hot stove.
He was vain enough" to imagine that
he was the idol of the dear people,
and as a feeler invited himself to a
seat at the school board, and was
literally buried by unfriendly votes.
He is supposed to be running a dem
ocratic sheet, but the only good
sense he has ever displayed was in
selecting his ideal candidate • from
the republican ranks. Were it not
for his periodical pilgrimages to the
county's strong box in shape of po
litical patronage, he would have
famished for lack of grass. He feels
the need of an auxiliary safe, and
advised his townsfolks to set up a
city government. This would pro
vide another valuable source of pap
from his standpoint, but the voters
detected the bug and jumped on the
scheme with both feet. His favorite
pastime since his advent in Amador
has been to borrow money from who
ever would loan..— He tried his
scheme on the writer, but it failed to
work, and this failure to respond to
his monetary disability is no doubt
the secret of his wrath. This may
be the true key to his career as a
journalist, to proceed to abuse those
who refuse to pungle up at his bid -
ding. To impart interest to his
mediocre sheet he invited corre
spondence on local topics, and pour
ed out the vials of personal abuse on
the first one that foolishly availed
himself of the offor, under the im
pression that it ,vas made in good
faith. That is the way he prosti
tutes a noble calliug. He has been
talking against the town of Jackson
ever since he set foot within its
limits, always predicting evils lurk
ing in the future — evils that have
never materialized and are never like
ly to materialize — and the evilmon
ger continues — without any strings
attached to him — to make the imagi
nary plague spot his abiding city.
He does business largely without
cash, and his creditors have to
"make even" by trading the amount
in advertising; and he thereupon
boasts of this discreditable fact, and
falsely attributes it to the superior
quality of his journalistic wares.
He chronicles that "John Doe from
Slabtown, and Richard Roe from
Jackson Gate, visited Jackson on
business," and insults the intelli
gence of Amador county by intimat
ing through a standing notice in his
columns that this sort of drivel is
the mainstay of a county paper. He
can find something to^cbmmend in
every town in Amador county, ex
cept the one wherein he has cast his
lot. Like most financial failures,
he prates about how other people
ought to invest their means in the
upbuilding of the town, but has never
raised one stone upon another in
that direction himself. He hugs tbe
delusion that a city composed ex
clusively of persons like himself
would be a veritable Eden, while
sensible citizens think it would be
the place of all places on earth to
keep away from. He goeth to church
and thanketh tbe Lord that he is not
like other men; and the people with
one accord doth gratefully say
"Amen."
We apologise to our readers for
wasting so much space on so small
a subject. We do not approve of
this style of writing. We never re
sort to it freely ami voluntarily. The
only excuse we can give for it now
is, that it is sometimes necessary to
answer a fool along the lines of his
own folly.
FEES OF COUNTY OFFICERS.
Fees were collected b"y the re
spective county* officers during the
month of December, and paid into
the county treasury as follows:
U. S. Gregory, sheriff $ 900
D. A. Patterson, recorder. . 192 65
C. L. Culbert, county clerk. 82 60
The insignificant showing made by
the sheriff's office calls for explana
tion. The amount received last
month from this source is above the
average. One month the receipts
fell as low as $4; another $6. The
truth is the fees of the sheriff's of
fice have virtually ceased to be a
source of county revenue. Years
ago, it was an important source of
revenue. The change has been
brought about not so much by fall
ing off in the business of the office,
as by tinkering with the laws gov
erning the disposition of the fees.
The truth is the fees have been di
verted from the county treasury into
the pockets of the sheriff and private
parties appointed by the court un
der recent chauges in the law as
commissioners for the sale of prop
erty under foi-eclosure. All these
changes, while benefitting private
individuals, and placing more pat
ronage in the hands of officials, have
been detrimental to the interests of
the taxpayers. There never was
ajiy demaud in public sentiment for
the euactmeut of such laves. The
machinery of government never ran
more smoothly or with greater sat
isfaction to the people generally
than when all fees and commissions
collected by county officers were
required to be paid into the
county treasury. As the law now
stands the sheriff is authorized to re
tain "for his own use and benefit,
the mileage, fees and commissions
for all service of papers whatsoever
issued by any court of the state out
side of his county." That is the
little joker that is responsible- for
the curtailment of revenue from
sheriff's fees. The system is a per
nicious one, not merely because it
helps to swell the income of a county
officer who was before amply paid
for his services, but for other rea
sons. It remains for those respon
sible for such unwholesome changes
in the law to explain the true in
wardness thereof." We frankly ad
mit that we arc at a loss to explain
it in any way consistent with the
interests of the county.
ANOTHER MOVE TO WATCH.
There is a move on foot by the
Bar Association of San Francisco to
make the costs of a jury in civil
cases a county charge. The only
plea urged in behalf of this move
ment is that as the law now stands —
requiring the litigant in whose favor
judgment is rendered to deposit the
jury fees— a hardship is inflicted
upon poor litigants. They, in many
instances, are debarred from de
manding a jury by this provision.
The proposed change, however, is
simply another of those insidious
moves to encourage litigation at the
expense of the public. We believe
it to be the duty of the press, with
out regard to party, to fight against
any further change in this direction .
Indeed, there is ample room for re
form in the opposite direction. The
county treasury is now bearing, and
has borne for many years, the main
burden of expense in deciding the
legal rights of private contestants in
court. Superior court fees have
been whittled to almost nothing. A
day's trial in court costs litigan ts
$2.50; while for the salary of the
superior judge alone, the taxpayers
are called upon to pay $10, to say
nothing of the salary of clerk and
sheriff. The legislator who has the
courage to make a determined effort
to correct this outrage will earn the
lasting gratitude of the people.
When private parties get into a
wrangle about their rights, and ap
peal to the courts to settle their
quarrel, the losing party should be
made to\ bear the entire burden
thereof. The one who is adjudged
to be in the wrong should be made
to pay. It is a gross miscarriage of
justice to throw the costs upon in
nocent parties. The argument tbat
poor litigants in the matter of pay
ment of jury fees are at a disad
vantage, is a specious one. They
would be at a disadvantage under
any arrangement. Because some
persons without means become in
volved in law suits, that is no reason
for imposing additional financial
burdens upon other poor men — the
bulk of the taxpayers — who have no
interest in the outcome of the legal
strive.

THE AMAI>OR LEDGER: JACKSON, qALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, JANUARY IT. 1902.
Opinion seems to be divided as to
the most practicable aud desirable
route for the isthmian canal. The
fact that the French engineers,
after a thorough examination of the
ground, decided in favor of the Pan
ama route, would indicate that that
is the more feasible plan. Much
work has been done on this Hue, and
the French interests may be bought
for forty millions — a large sum it is
true, but not worth haggling over if
important advantages are to be
gained thereby. On the other hand
many favor the Nicaragua route,
for the reason probably that it would
involve less money. No doubt Con
gress will digest the arguments pro
and con before finally committing
the nation to this stupendous but all
important enterprise. The canal
will undoubtedly be built, and that
to by the United States, but let us
see to it that we secure the best
route obtainable. A few million dol
lars one way or the other should cut
no figure in deciding the line of this
undertaking.

"I was troubled for about seven
years with my stomach and in bed half
my time," says E. Demick, Some'r
ville, Ind. "I spent about $1,000 and
never could get anything to help me
until I tried Kodol Dyspepsia Cure.
I have taken a few bottles and am en
tirely well." You don't live by what
you eat, but by what you digest 'and
assimilate. If your stomach doesn't
digest your food you are really starv
ing. Kodol Dyspepsia Cure does the
stomach's work by digesting the food.
You don't have to diet. Eat all you
want. Kodol Dyspepsia Cure cures all

Fire ■ Company Meeting,
A special meeting of the Jackson
Fire Company was held in tho super
visor's room on Monday evening, to
make arrangements for the annual ball
for the benefit of the company. The
attendance was larger than usual at
such gatherings. It was decided to
have the ball on the 7th of February
instead of the 11th, as annoupced . last
week. The reason for tho change is
that the latter date was the eve of the
lenten season, and it was thought that
this might interfere somewhat with the
success of the ball. The following
named gentlemen were appointed an
executive committee, with full power
to arrange for the ball: Dr, A. M,
Gall (chairman;) B. F. Taylor, R. I.
Kerr, A. B. Caminetti, F. Burgin, R.
Parker, M. E. Muldoon, R. L. Mann,
G. D. Calvin, and C. W. Freeman.
Failed to Obey the Court.
Julia Oneto was cited to appear be»
fore the superior court last Wednesday
to show cause why she had failed to
obey the order of the court, that the
six year old son, confided to her
custody, spend two days of each month
with the father at the Oneto ranch,
five miles from Jackson. Mrs. Oneto
obtained a divorce from Bartolomeo
Oneto some time ago. The decree aU
lowed $30 per month for the support of
the minor child, and that the father
should enjoy the child's company two
days each month. Mrs. Oneto lives in
Jackson, and tho father resides near
Irishtown-. The child has manifested
an unwillingness to leave his mother,
and hence the father's action in court
to enforce the provisions of the decree.
The court ordered that the child be
taken to the Oneto ranch next Satur
day, and be returned to its mother on
Monday; this course to be followed
once every month. Also that the $30
per month for main talnauco be left at
Ginocchio Bros, store tor Mrs. Qnotg.
THE AMADOR LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFOK-NIA, FRIDAY, JANUARY 17, 1902.
BURGLARY AT SLABTOWN.
The Perpetrator Arrested at Clements.
Tho residence of J. I. l'ool near Slab
town, was burglarized ami robbed the
middle of last week. Pool is a barber.
After the Stono Company eot through
with their work he moved his business
placo from tho Tabeaud reservoir to
near Slabtown, and employ oil his time
between cutting wood and his tonsorial
profession. A ,man named George
Walder was also employed in cutting
wood in that vicinity. On the day of
the burglary, Walder assisted Pool in
loading his wagon with wood, and the
latter came to Jackson to dispose of it.
When Pool got home from his trip he
found his home looted. It seems that
Walder, as soon us Pool got out of
sight, burglarized the dwelling and
took therefrom' Pool's best Bult of
clothes, an extra vest, 13 razors, a shot
gun, a brass watch, a pocket knife, and
a dozen cans of sardines. He appeared
at Morris' cabin, not far from the scene
of his adventure, wearing the extra
vest, and • partook of liquid refresh
ments. He next struck P. Ferrari's
residence, and after leaving there
donned the stolen suit, and sot out on
foot toward the yaljoy. Constable
Kay notified sheriff Slbley of Stockton
that the culprit was heading toward
that city, who immediately telephoned
a description of the man to Clements,
and was told that the wanted individual
had just left that village.' At the ro r
quest of the sheriff, G. W". Rainey ar
rested Walder, and held him until tho
sheriff arrived, and tpflk him tp Stock
ton. Constable Kay went to Stockton
Saturday and brought the prisoner to
Jackson the same evening. All the
stolen articles were recovered, except
the sardines, which the accused had
eaten, Walt}?)-" g-drjijts breaking into
the house and taking tba property." ; "■■_
Heavy Damage Suit.
Thomas Scoble has commenced suit
against the Oneida G. M. & M. Co., to
recover Jhe sum of $10,500 damages,
for injuries sustained by bjm while em
ployed in the Oneida mine. The com
plaint alleges that prior to the 9th day
of April, 1901, plaintiff was employed
as a miner in the north stope of the
1900 foot level of said mine, Qn tha>
day a section of the hanging wall,
about 3000 lbs., fell upon him, Inflict
ing serious internal and external in
juries, to wit: a fracture of t?ie fifth or
last lumbar vertebra, causing partial
paralysis of the lower limbs, and also
partial paralysis of the intestines and
bladder. . Ho was confined to his bed
foiMnany months as tho result of his
injuries, and is now able to move about
only in an invalid's chair, and is still
unable^to walk or stand, and will al
ways remain a helpless cripple; that
he will never again be able to resume
his business of mining, or do any man
ual labor whatever. The complaint
further says that the defendant cor
poration, ' its superintendent, Chas.
Derby, and foreman, Jos, Ispla, were
guilty of gross carelessness In not prop
erly timbering the underground work
ings of said .mine; that prior to the
cave above referred to, plaintiff re
quested that the hanging wall be prop
erly timbered, but those in charge re
fused to have the same timbered; that
the cave would not have occurred if
the timbering- had been done. Plain
tiff has been compelled by reason of his
injuries, to employ surgeons, a nurse,
etc., at a Cost of $500, and is now in
formed that it will bo necessary for
him to undergo an operation that will
entail a cost of $1000. He therefore,
asks judgment for the above amount,
and costs. W. J. McGee is plaintiff's
attorney.
A Pioneer Departed.
Reuben B. Ball was born near Elk
hart. Elkhart county, Indiana, on the
sth day of May, 1832, and died at his
home near Latrobe, in Amador county,
on the 13th of January, 1902, aged 69
years, 8 months and 1 day. When a
young man he left his home in Indiana
and came tp California in pr about the
year '51 or '52. Here he remained for
about ten years. He then returned to
his home in Indiana, where he was
united in marriage to Miss Katharina
Gabel, with whom he lived happily for
13 years. After remaining there two
years he, with his wife and folks, left
that state and came to California. Here
Reuben took up a farm on the Cosum nes
river, near Latrobe, whiph soon provi
ed, by the hard toiling of both he and
his wife, to be their happy little home
as long as their dear lives survived.
Reuben was the beloved father of eight
children, Oliver,- Calvin, Sherman,
Walter, Melvina and Emma Ball,
Dora Painter and Helen Estey. Dur
ing the last few hours of his illness,
he lost his mental faculties, and passed
away like one falling asleep.

Mining.
To Crosscut at the Kirkwood— The
Del Monte Buys Some Machinery.
Amador-Phoenix Clean-up.
Kirkwood. — A meeting of the Kirk
wood Company was held in Jackson
the first of the week. The indebtedness
of nearly $600 was wiped out by volun
tary contributions on the part of those
present. It wits decided to crosscut
for the ledge at once, from the present
depth of the shaft — about 715 feet.
They will run east first, as the pre
ponderating opinion. Is that the ledge
lies in that direction. It is also the in
tention to go west, as the surface indi
cations point to another lodge In that
direction. Everything was harmoni
ous at the meeting, and there was no
feeling of discouragement manifested.
A gopd deal (jf further prospecting will
be done before they entertain tho least
idea of abandoning operations. Those
interested in the Pebrless^-the adjoin
ing property on -the north — are watch
ing the developments of the Kirkwood,
as upon the result will depend tho re
sumption of work upon that property.
Df,l MONTE.— The directors of the
Del Monte group of mines in Calaveras
county, at their meeting held January
3, adopted resolutions authorizing the
superintendent to buy and install at
once a compressor and outfit for the
operating of power drills upon their
new omssoul tunnel. Tlw superin
tendent immediately thereafter closed
with Jas. E. Dye of Jackson, for the
purchase of his Rlx and Firth single
cylinder compressor, situated on the
Amador Gold mine near Jackson. In
addition to this, he purchased tho re
ceiver, qut-pflhind vajyes. used in con
nection therewith, 3000 feet of 3-inch
compressed air pipe, and a quantity of
drill steel with sharpening tools. The
work q! remgying these, to the mine
has already begun, under the super
vision of the superintendent and his
expert assistant, Cornelius O'Neill Jr.
The force of men at the mine has been
increased, and all are now actively en
gaged in preparing for the installation
of the new plant. Grading for road
ways and for foundation worfc has al
roady begun,, and pians and estimates
have been prepared under the direc
tion of Messrs. Garbarini. of Jackson.
The compressor will first be removed
to Sutter Creek for necessary foundry
work, after which it vvilj be in all re
spepts equal to a new machine. -The
estimated cost of the installation of this
outfit is $2500, gross; a figure below
the not cost of a new outfit. The en
tire financial Outlook of the company
Is brighter than at any time since the
Incorporation. Only a few thousand
shares now remain unsold, and most of
these have already been spoken for, so
that we can positively assort that no
more stock will be upon the market
after March first. They have money
in the treasury and forthcoming from
monthly payments to prosecute the
work with full force, and intend to
make Del Monte mino one of tho busi
est little communities in tho mining belt.
Work is still being carried on in the
east drift, in which Indications still
show large values ahead; as also upon
the old shaft over tho west drift, in
which the ledge has been uncovered
two feet in width' at a depth of 40
feet, -with gopd prospect showing.
Rail Rpad Flat mining district has de
veloped quite a boom within the last
few months, several mines having been
started with good financial backing, so
essential to success: and work in most
of them is being^ prosecuted upon ex
cellent prospects. The Jones mine and
the Little Giant, both near neighbors
to Del Monte, have been working upon
valuable ore deposits, and others are
meeting equally encouraging bodies of
rock.
Amador-Phoenix.— A clean-up
was made at this mill last week.
Mixed rock from the dump was run
through, and it was not expected that
it would .prove of paying vaule. We
have not learned how much it yielded
per ton. The mill is now idle, but will
be started again shortly, on ore from
the level now being opened as soon as
fuel can be procured.
Argonaut.— The shaft of this mine
has reached a depth of 2020 feet, and
sinking still continues in tho hardest
kind of greenstone.
Burned With Gas.
Albert Lagomarsi.no, the young man
who runs the car at the Kennedy mine,
met with a painful experience last Fri
day. He was attending to the heating
of some coal tar for tarring the cables.
It was at night time, and he went to
add more fuel, taking an open lantern
to throw light upon the work. Tar
when heated generates an inflammable
gas. As soon as the light met this gas
an explosion occurred, the jet of (lame
catching him full in the face. His in
juries compelled him to quit work, and
on reaching his home on Stump street,
Jackson, Dr. L. E. Phillips was called,
and dressed his injuries. The burns
are not deep, but they were serious
enough to cause the skin to peal off.
He is getting along nicely, and no per
manent marks will result from the
mishap. He is still unable to resume
his employment, but expects to do so
in a few days.

Ficcardo— Oneto Wedding.
The Catholic church of Jackson was
crowded last Sunday with those anxious
to witness the ceremony that was to
unite in life companionship Louis
Piccardo and Miss Theresa Oneto.
The marriage was solemnized at noon,
immediately after the regular morning
service, the I^ov. J. J. Gleason officiat
ing. The bride, richly attired in white,
was attended by Miss Etta Qinooohlo
as bridesmaid, who was prettily and
becomingly dressed in blue. Lawrence
Oneto, brother of the bride, acted as
best man.
Immediately after the ceremony,
the newly married couple and invited
guests repaired to the residence of the
groom's parents, Mr. and Mrs. A.
Piccardo, on the Jackson Gate road,
and partook of the weddjng banquet.
It was a feast to be remembered, gotten
up without regard to expense, and in
the best style of the culinary art. An
hour or two was passed in jovialty and
congratulations. Shortly after 4 the
happy pair departed for tone, re
mained there that night. The follow
ing morning they tgok the train for
San Francisco, on a honeymoon trip.
They will return in about a week, and
will thereafter make their home at the
Piccardo residence.
The bride is a daughter of Stephen
Oneto, the gardener, who lives plp.se to
the Middle Fork schoolhouse, five miles
from Ja«kson, who also has large real
estate interests in Jackson. She is a
bright, accomplished, and attractive
young lady, and a favorite with a largo
circle of acquaintances. The groom is
the eldest son of A. Piccardo, the well
known merchant $nd owner of freight
teams plying between Iqne and Jack
son. The Ledger joins with their hpst
of friends in wishing the wedtjed. couple
a long and happy matrimonial life.
Suit to Quiet Title.
Jacob Vandament has commenced an
action against the South Eureka Min
ing Company to quiet title to the
use for agricultural purposes of $h.e
surface of certain mining ground owned
by the defendant corporation. In 1889
plaintiff- and wife, Julia Vandament,
entered into an agreement with J. L.
Mayon for the sale of the lands now
owned by the said company, and, vpade
a deed conveying 1 said to said
Mayon, and escrowed the deed with
Jackson Dennis in Sutter Creek. The
agreement provided that J. L. ft{ayp,n,
was desirious of apa^'ulrlng said prop
erty for mining purposes only, and re
served the use of all surface not re
quired for mining operations, for agri*
cultural and grazing purposes. Said
Mayon thei-eaf ter transferred bia rights
under tho agreement to the South
Eureka Company, who afterward paid
to plaintiff and wife the full purchase
price of $30,000. The company now
contends that plaintiff, to whom has
been assigned all the rights of Julia
Vandament, has merely a life intergst
in the use of the surface ground, and
that this claim has cast a cloud over
tho title of plaintiff. He therefore
prays that ho be adjudged to have a
yalid title, and that upon his death his
title therein will vest iv his heirs and
legatees. W. J. McGee represents the
plaintiff's side of the c^e,

An Efficient Teacher Goes to the City.
Miss Wanda Reichling, who has been
in the public school of Jackson fer sev
eral years, resigned her position last
week, and left for San Francisco Tues
day morning, to accept a place in the
school department of that city. Dur
ing the vacation Miss Reichling was in
San Francisco, and successfully passed
the examination of applicants. Out of
140 before the board of examiners, only
12 passed the ordeal, and Miss Reich
ling stood well toward the head of the
list of successful ones. She will be em
ployed on the substitute list at first,
but will soon secure a place on the
regular staff of teachers. In the de
parture of Miss Reichling, Amador
county loses one of its most efficien t
teachers. She has always retained the
confidence and esteem of the pupils of
her class, and has displayed an apti
tude for imparting instruction that
cannot fail to secure recognition at the
hands of the educational board. Jack
son regrets to lose one so signally fitted
for her chosen work, and at the same

Large Fortune Left by D. T. Davies.
A press dispatch from Tacoma says:
An estate valued at between $250,000
and $300,000 was left by D. T. Davies,
the coal expert of the Southern Pacific,
who died two weeks ago at Carbonado,
and who was well known throughout
Amador county. Though one of the
most prominent coal experts in the
northwest, Captain Davies did not in
vest his money in coal mines, but in
stead invested it largely in city prop
erty. He was a large owner of Tacoma
Inside property, which gave him a good
Income. His salary was $25,000 per
year. The will was admitted to pro
bate to-day, having been executed last
April.
Seven children survive him and are
made equal beneficiaries. For some
reason Waker Davies, one son, was not
originally given an equal share. On
his death bed Captain Davies called his
children together and added a codicil
to the will, at the same time asking
that they do not neglect Walter, but
treat him tho same as the others, share
and share alike. One daughter is
studying music in Berlin.

Good Work.
A good piece of road work has been
done from the north Main street bridge
to the gulch below the old toll house
on the Kennedy grade. The stretch is
about a quarter of a mile in length.
The whole of it has been treated with
a thick coat of broken rock from the
Argonaut dump. The job was finish
ed last Tuesday. It has been done at
far less cost than any equal stretch of
roadway macadamized by the county's
rock breaker. Thos. Maher started
the ball, by hauling rock from the Ar
gonaut to tho road in front of his
premises. Frank Hoffman, Tom Nor
man, John Strohm and Dave Mattley
then got in with their teams, and re
inforced with a team employed by the
road commissioner, they have made
this piece of road — which for years has
been one of the worst places between
Jackson and Sutter Creek — to compare,
favorably with any portion of highway
in the county. They have been about
three weeks in doing the work. It
now remains for the owners along Main
street to take up the work where these
road-makers have left off, and extend
the improvement to the middle fork
bridge. Jackson will then have a busi
ness street to be proud of, instead of an.
eye-sore, as at present.

years old, I now uiu able to do all my

Re Wouldn't Interfere.
An old Scotchman wont to stay for
a short time, as he said, with friends
of his, a young couple with no family.
After living with them for some, two
or three weeks the young couple began
to get tired of their visitor, but did
not like to tell him the state of tlielr
feelings toward lilin, so they arranged
a little plnn between them as to how
they would get rid of him. -
"Tomorrow," said the husband,
"when I come home for dinner, I shall
quarrel about the soup and say it is
not good. In the midst of our quarrel
we will appeal to our friend, and if he
takes your part I will give him notice
to leave the house, and if he takes my
part you do just the same."
Next day at dinner the "quarrel"
arose about the soup, and in the heat
of the argument "uncle" was appealed
to; but he coolly replied:
"Ye see, ma freens, for a' the time 1
intend tae be here— Just a month or
twa— l hae made up ma mind no tae
Interfere wi' ye'r boose affairs."
A' Story of Wendell Phillips.
At the close of the civil war and be
fore he was well known Wendell Phil
lips, the distinguished abolitionist,
went to Charleston and put up at a ho
tel. Ho had breakfast served ln bis
room and was waited upon by a slave.
Mr. Phillips seized tho opportunity to
represent to the nesro in a pathetic
way that he regarded him as a man
and a brother and, more than that,
that he himself was an abolitionist.
The negro, however, seemed more anx
ious about his breakfast than he was
about his position In the social scale
or the condition of his soul, and finally
Mr. Phillips became discouraged and
told him to go away, saying that ho
could not bear to be waited on by a
slave.
"You must 'scuse me, massa," said
the negro. "I is 'bilged to stay here
'cause I'm 'sponsible for de silver
ware."
Charity* Choice.
"Mummy," said a small girl—"mum
my, dear, I do wish I might give some
money for poor children's dinners."
"So you may, darling."
"But, mummy, I haven't any mon
ey."
"Well, darling, If you like to go with
out sugar I will give you the money
instead, and then you will have some."
The small child considered solemnly
for a moment, and then said. "Must
It be sugar, mummy?"
"Why, no, darling. I don't mind
much. What would you like to do
without?"
"How would soap do, mummy,
then?" exclaimed the small maiden in
triumph.— Philadelphia Ledger.
Got Ills Money.
When King Edward VII. was an un
dergraduate at Oxford, he was a great
huntsman, and few men could beat him
across country. On one occasion his
roj-nl highness and some other ' riders
galloped into a farmyard by way of a
short cut The farmer, a sturdy yeo
man, closed the gates and told the
huntsmen they must pay £1 n piece for
trespass.
One of the gentlemen smiled futlul
gcntly nt the rustic and said. "Rut, my
good man. tliis is the Prince of Wales."
The good man was in nowise abashed
and retorted, "l'i'ince or no prince. I'll
liave my money." And he got it

In an article on the training of wild
animals ln Frank Leslie's Popular
Monthly Frank C. Bostock, the famous
showman, said: "If I were to lay down
a basic principle, I would say, just as
my father did to me the first time he
ever gave me a whip and a lion, 'First
of all, warm up to him.' That does not
mean to pet him or talk silly nonsense
of the affe.qtlonate sort, but to treat
him with a frank, :ommon sense and
I kindly band and care.
"Once a very fierce old tiger which
we had in London had nearly killed my
brother, and her keepers were afraid
of her. It happened that she ran a bjt
of bone Into her paw and had a very
sorry time of it. I undertook to re
move it and by the use of lashings and
a little .patience succeeded. It took
four men to help me. When we were
about half way through the operation,
she got the idea of what we were try
lug to do for her, and a more docile
patient surgeon never had, though the
pain was great, I am sure. The next
day 1 put a poultice on that foot with
one keeper standing outside the cage
with a prodding Iron as a precaution,
and ever after that till the day of her
death I could enter her cage at any
time without her giving any sign but
that of pleasure."
lie Knew Hla Friend.
An old German was on his deathbed.
In his earlier years he had led a wild
life, but since the death of Schneider,
one of his boon companions, he had re
formed and given up his bad habits.
This Schneider In his day had been a
mighty drinker, famous for his capacl-
Ity and carouses.
The priest was ministering to the dy
ing man, consoling him with visions
of the paradise he would soon enter,
telling him that he would meet there
his old friends ana what a joy it would
bo to see Ui. ;;i v.'.'i again.
The dying man asked feebly, "Will
Schneider be there, your reverence?"
Thinking to give him pleasure, the
priest replied, "Yes; Schneider will be
there."
"Ach!" said the other. "Dot Is very
bad. All dose dringlngs und eadlngs
iisid fighdlngs all over again, all dot
beer und whisky!"
"But there will be no drinking In
heaven," said the priest
"But you said Schneider would be
dere."
"So he will," was the priest's reply.
"Und dere won't be no dringlngs,
you dink? Ach! -You don't know
Schneider !"— Llpplncott's.
Long Courtahlp* In Norway.
Norwegian weddings are almost al
ways celebrated at the close of a short
Scandinavian summer, a season which
the industrious Norsemen find too short
In which to work and from which they
would never dream of taking the days
that are necessary for the long drawn
out festivities of the Norse wedding.
So the maidens who are wooed all the
year round are usually wedded at the
beginning of winter. Norwegian woo
ings are very frank and very long a-do-
Ing. On summer Sundays the lanes,
tlie highways and byways are ateem
with lovers. Each couple saunters
slowly along, not In the least shy, his
arm about her shoulders, her arm about
bis waist Nor do they untwine their
arms If they pause a little to chat with
friends, not even if they stop to speak
with casual acquaintances. Ten or a
dozen years often elapse between the
first day of courtship and the day of
piarriage, while a seven years' betroth
al is considered of very moderate
length.— Woman's Home Companion.
Fable of the Babbling Brook.
Once upon a time a fish In search of
adventure came to the broad moutb of
a brook which emptied Itself into a
great river. Ho turned Into the smaller
stream, ascended Its current and lis
tened to Its constant babbling as ho
went leisurely along.
As he proceeded he noticed that the
brook became very much narrower and
shallower. Yet It kept up its babbling
Just the same. Finally he reached" Its

Sinner In 1832.
In 1832 Coleridge in his Table Talk
spoke of the word talented as follows:
"I regret to* see that vile and barba
rous vocable 'talented' stealing out of
the newspapers into the leading re
views and most respectable publica
tions of today. Why not 'shllllnged,'
'farthlnged,' 'tenpenced,' etc.? The
formation of a participle passive from
a noun is a license which nothing but
a very peculiar felicity can excuse. If
mere convenience Is to justify such at
tempts upon the idiom, you cannot
stop until the language becomes, hi the
proper sense of the word, corrupt
Most of these pieces of slang come
from America."

ERRORS OF HISTORY
FICTIONS THAT FOR CENTURIES HAVE
POSED AS FACTS.
Wliy the Colossus of Ithodea Could
Not Have Spanned tbe Harbor— The
Force of LeouUlnv at Thermopj Ijc.
The William Tell Mj-th.
There have been woven Into history
Diauy Interesting stories that time and
Investigation have proved myths, but
In spite of the efforts of the Iconoclasts
these mistakes of history still pass
current with many people. ■
Probably one of the most affecting
scenes connected with the making of
literature Is that described In the oft
repeated story of the blind poet Milton
fllctating "Paradise Lost" to his daugh
ters. Dr. Johnson, however, has been
quoted as denying It He said, further
more, that Milton never even permitted
his daughters to learn to read and
write.
A favorite "piece" with western and
southern schoolboys on recitation and
exhibition days was a set of verses tell
ing of the heroic stand of Leonldas and
his brave "300" at Thermopylae. The
Abbe Barthelemy, who asserted that
he had inquired minutely Into the sub
ject, wrote that, according to Diodorus,
Leonidas had 7,000 men under him and
that Pausanias gave the number of Lo
onidas' army as 12,000.
Did Caesar say to the pilot:
"Why do you fear? You have Caesar
on board."
Many trustworthy historians declare
that Caesar never used the words
quoted.
The inside of cigar box covers are
sometimes ornamented with a picture
of the Colossus of Rhodes, with ships
In full sail passing between the out
stretched legs of the gigantic statue.
These pictures reflect the»popular and
what for centuries was the historical
Idea of the Colossus, which was ac
counted one of the seven wonders of
the world. It ' may be Interesting to
know that all drawings of the statue
are purely imaginary and, what is
more, are modern, not ancient, efforts.
The Colossus was erected in 805 B. O.
The most trustworthy of ancient ac
counts of It Is contained In a manu
script dating about 150 B. C, in which
the height of the statue is given as 105
feet The entrance to the harbor of
Rhodes Is 350 feet across, so that It
was manifestly impossible that the legs
of the Colossus should span the en
trance to the port or that ships should
sail beneath It
As a matter of fact the Colossus was
not built across the harbor, but on an
open space of ground near It; but, for
all that, it was a wonderful statue.
People whose sympathies are easily
aroused have wept over the %rongs
of Belisarius, the conqueror of j tH6
Vandals, who, many were taught,
"begged his bread at the city gates"
after having commanded victorious
armies and been of much service to
the state. The good old general was
unquestionably an unfortunate and
much abused man, but there is no
proof that he begged his living at the
city gates or elsewhere. Yet Van Dyke
engraved him and David, the great
Frenchman, painted him, and trage
dies and romances were written
around him In the belief that he did sit
at the city gates a forlorn and discon
solate object with palm outstretched
for alms.
The facts are, a conspiracy against
the Emperor Justinian being discover
ed, two of Belisarius' officers confessed
under torture that the old general was
In the plot He was condemned with
out further hearing, his property se
questrated, and he suffered imprison
ment for six months. His Innocence
being established, Belisarius was re
leased, and he died about a year later.
But that he ever was reduced to the
extremity of begging is declared to be
absolutely untrue. '■■' V;'
The schoolbook tale of William Tell
shooting an apple from his son's head
Is also without foundation In fact.
Tell's name doesn't even appear in the
chronicles of Zurich, and the most an
cient writing In which the story Is
mentioned bears date some 200 years
after the event It pretends to describe.
The story Is a variation of an old Scan
dinavian saga. A similar bit of "his
tory" Is related of William of Clouds
ley In England in the twelfth century.
It is denied also that Emperor
Charles V. of Spain on bis abdication
ndopted_ the habit of a monk and occu
pied himself in the manufacture of
clocks. It Is declared that he never
ceased to be emperor de facto, and he
never surrendered control of affairs of
state. ;•..*;,':
Coming down to later times, the peo
ple of three different countries claimed
three different men as inventors of the
steam engine. In America there is a
popular belief to this day that Robert
Fulton built the first successful engine
and steamboat In England the Mar
quis of Worcester, who published an
account of a steam engine In 1663, has
received credit for the Invention. In
France Solomon de Caus (1C15) was re
garded as the genius who bad given to
the world a new motive power. Each
of them may have conceived and work
ed out the idea of a steam engine with
out the slightest knowledge of what
had been done In that direction before
their day, but none of them might
rightly lay claim to. being the first In
the field.
On April 17, 1543, Don Blasco de
Garay launched a boat of 200 tons bur
den at Barcelona In the presence of the
Emperor Charles Y. The bpat was pro
pelled by steam and made ten miles an
hour. She was called La Sanctlssima
Trlnidada. The emperor gave to Don
Blasco a handsome present; but did not
regard the Invention as practicable,
and nothing came of It From this it
would seem that Fulton was centuries
behind the times.— Mew York Mail and

Jk Simple Little Trick at Once Ef-
fective and Mysterious.
Here la a trick that is always effec
tive, and, while It Is very simple in
deed, still It Is bound to appear just a
wee bit mysterious, and many, espe
cially your little brothers and sisters,
will be unable to explain it.
Take two ordinary claret glasses and
fill one to the brim with claret and the
ether equally full with clear water.
Cover the top of the glass containing
water with an ordinary visiting card
so that there are no places around the
edge uncovered by the card. Turn the
glass upside down and place It on the
top of the glass containing claret and
adjust the glasses so that their edges
meet exactly all the way around.
Now move the card slightly to one
Elde so that there will be a little space
at one side of the glasses inside uncov
ered by a card. At once a thin stream
of claret will begin to rise through this
space, not mixing with the water at
all, but Its edges clear and sharply de
fined. The water, too, will begin to de
scend Into the glass containing the
claret, a pure, glistening white stream
against the ruddy red.
The stream of claret, too, rising
through the sparkling white of the wa
ter presents a beautiful effect, and in a
moment the claret will begin to spread
about the top of the upper glass like
the unfolding of a red rose and the wa
ter will spread In fhe bottom of the
lower glass. The two fluids will not
mix, but will present a delightful con
trast of red and white with sharply de
fined edges. _-
: In a very short time the "claret and
water will have changed places, the
claret being ln the upper glass and the
water In the lower. This Is due to the
difference ln weight of the liquids; wa
ter, being the heavier, forces itself Into
the lower glass, and a portion of the
claret Is moved up to take the place of
the descending water.— New York ' He

CURE FOR CATARRH.
A. Remedy Which an Old Virginian
Says I» Infallible.
An old Virginia horse breeder who Is
visiting In New York claims to have an
Infallible cure for catarrh. "It seems to
me," he said "that 90 per cent of the
people of New York city suffer more
or less from catarrh. If they will do
as I suggest, they can cure themselves
In short order.
"A friend of mine who used to live
In Yonkers had such a severe case of
catarrh that he was compelled to give
up his business and go to Colorado.
The doctors told him that the high alti
tude of that state would benefit him.
He remained In Colorado nearly a year
and then found himself as badly off as
when he left Yonkers. 'After he had
made up his mind that nothing could
cure him and that he might as well
die at home as among strangers he met
an old tinker, who gave him the reme
dy, which cured him In three months.
"Dissolve a little powdered alum In a
pint of elder vinegar. Use the solution
as a gargle three or four times a day.
It won't do any harm if you swallow
some of It Two or three times a day,
but particularly just before going to
bed, dip a chicken feather In vaseline
and stick the feather up the nostrils.
I suppose any contrivance bought at a
drug store for. the purpose will do Just
as well as a chicken feather, but the
old tinker insisted that there was some
medicinal virtue In the feather.
"The gargle clears the throat and the
lower portions of the air passages from
the nostrils. The vaseline heals the dis
eased condition of the affected parts.
In a week the sufferer will feel better,
and if he will keep up the treatment he
can be assured that he will be cured."

Slxklller'a Arm a Deadly Weapon.
"Another man has been killed by a
blow of the fist, which suggests the
thought that at- times the naked fist of
a man, given proper impetus by a well
developed biceps, Is an exceedingly
dangerous and destructive Instrument,"
said a man who for many years lived
at Vlnita, In the Cherokee Nation.
"It recalls a bit of history local to the
Indian Territory," he continued. "Not
far from the Arkansas line there lived
a half breed who went by the name of
John Sixkiller. He was a bad man,
but not bad in the ordinary southwest
ern way—that Is to say,, he was'not a
'gun fighter,' although he enjoyed a
general mlxup Immensely, and until
the Cherokee council intervened he In
dulged In many such affrays.
"After three men whom he had laid
out' had died of then: Injuries the coun
cil (tribal legislature) met and passed
an act declaring that 'John Slxklller's
right arm Is a deadly weapon' and that
'he Is forbidden to use It against an ad
versary except to protect himself from
death or great bodily Injury.' "
