/Moore for Assembly
Makes Phenomenal Run.
K. li. Moore, tbe republican candi
date for tbe assembly, mado a re
markably .strong run. One point iv
his In v or, bo was well known in both
Calaveiiis and Amador counties,
which cast rnoro than nine-tenths of
the total voto of tbe district. An
other thing, he did not make tbo
stereotyped platform cauvass. 110
rather steered clear ot the public;
gatherings, and as far as wo know did
not appear on the platform or. make
a public speech during tbe cuiupaigu.
in Calaveras he was given a majority
of Gsl, and iv Amador 1115, making
H'Jfi Ju tbo two counties. These
figures will be somewhat increased by
Alpine amlMono counties, both repuli
licun. This, we believe, is the biggest
victoiy ever scored by a candidate for
the legislature iv this district.

TIMBEH SUPPLY
OF UNITED STATES
"Wo urn now cutting timber from
tbe forests ot the United Htatea at ttie
rate of DUO feet board measure « year
for every mini, woman, and ctiilrl.
la I'Jnrnpo they ueo only OU board
ieet."
b'evr stntemeuts could be nimlo
which would better convince tho
average man that this country leailo
tbe world Id tbe demand far timber.
Jt is made by TrcHdwell Cloveiaud jr..
in a circular which treats of the con
servation of tbe forests, soil, water,
and all the other great natural re
sources, which has just beeu publish
ed by the United States forest Ser
vice. Id speaking further of the con
sumption of timber in this country,
Mr Cleveland says:
"At this rate, in less than thirty
years all our remaining virgin timber
will be out. Meantime, the forests
which have been cat over «ro general
ly in a bad way for want of care;
they will produce only inferior
second growth. We are clearly over
tbe verge ot a timber famine.
"This Is not due to necessity, for
the forests are one of tho renewable
resources. Kightly used, they go on
produciug crop after crop indefinite
ly. The countries of Europe know
this, and Japan knows IC4 and their
forests are becumiug with time not
lees, but more, productive. We. pro
bably still possess siiUJcaeut forest
land to grow wood enough at home
to supply our own needs. If we ate
not blind, or willfully wasteful, we
may yet preserve our forest independ
ence und, with it, tbe fourtn ot our
great industries.
"Present wastes in lumbar pro
duction are enormous. Take the case
of yellow pine, which now ;the
list in tbe volume of aunuai cut. In
I!'U7 it is estimated that only one-half
of all tbe yellow pioe cut during the
season was used, and tbut the otber
half, amouutiug tn 8,000,O(JU cords,
was wasted. Such waste is typical
K. A. Long, in his address on 'forest
conservation' at tbe conference of
governors last spring, pointed out
that '20 per cent of tbe yellow pine
waa simply left in tbe woods— a waste
which represents tbe timber growing
on 300,000 acres.
"Tbe rest of the waste tukes pluse
at tho mill. Of course, it would
never do to speak of tbe muteriul re
jected at the mill as waate unless this
material could be turned to use Jby
some better nml more thorough form
of utilization. JJut in many caseu we
know, and in many other cases ue
have excellent reason to believe, that
niodtj if not all, of this material
could be used with profit. It is sim
ply a question of intelligent investi
gation and, moie than all, of during
the will to economize.
"IJut there are other ways to cou-j
servo the forests besides cutting in
half tbe present waste of forest pro
ducta. The forests cun be made to
produce three or four times us rapid
ly as they do at present. This Is
true of both the virgin forests and
the cut-over lands. Virgin forouls
are often fully stocked with ilrsl
clii.-.-i timber, but this stock has been
laid in very slowly, on auouut of the
wasteful competition which is carried
on constantly between tho rival trees-,
iheu, too, in tho virgin forests there
are very many trees which hu«e reach
ed maturity and stopped growing,
and these occupy spiicn which, if held
Uy younger trei!4, would be laying in
a new Ktock coustautly. As regards
the cut-over lund, severe cutting,
followed by tiro, has checked growth
sci seriously that iv most cases repro
duction is both poor and slow, while
iv many CUiei thuru la no true forest:
reproduction, at all at present, and
there la but little hopu for the
future. "

A Poetio Comparison.
The poet wna favoring a frlsnflly
soul with his last versos, says a
writer In Rt James' ntidscet. Tlio
verses wore descriptive of n beautiful
girl. Tho pout read:
"Her hnlr whs massed In flowing curls,
Tho color of a whisper."
This made thollNioner "fit up."
"Whafs that?" lie nnlii. "Rend tliat
again."
"I thought you would pay something
about tlint." tho poet answered. "1
don't want to appear" egotistical, but
that little plirnse gives some scope for
the exorcise of tho mind."
"In what way?"
The poet laughed.
"Don't you hoc,'.' he said, "hot* Death
tifully Hint describes the shade of her
■hair? Every poet speaks of golden
hair or raven locks. To be a success
one must bo original. Well, she did
not have golden linlr. It was nearly
golden, and 1 convey the Impression
by means of that one word."
The other still looked puzzled.
"You have heard," said the poet pn
tlently, "that silence is golden?" i
"Yes," the other admitted.
"Well/! resumed the poet, "If silence
Is golden what would a whisper bo?
It would bo nearly golden, wouldn't
it?"
Tbe poet laughed ngaln. The other
was sitting down and could not stag
ger, so he laughed too.
Indian Burials.
The Indian method of burial was to
fasten a corpse upon cross sticks sup
ported by poles In tlie ground or In the
boughs of the treetops. Hero the nlr
and the elements silently disposed of
the lifeless clay until in a year or so
but little remained to bear evidence of
a tomb, perhaps sonic broken sticks
In the top and a few scattered beads
or human bones beneath the burial
place. I caunot conceive of anything
more pitifully grewsome than an In
dian burial ground of this type. I
have seen them In the fall of tho
year, when the winds were shaking
and swaying the platforms and wring-
Ing the leafless trees, flaunting the
burial rags like signals of distress from
the dead and whistling through and
over the whitening bones and neglect
ed remains of those who' had many a
time withstood the tempest and storm
when the breath of life stirred within
tbenj.— Army and Navy Life.
The Pelican.
The pelican is not an attractive bird.
lie offends both the eye and the nose.
But he Is commendably regular in his
habits. The parent birds catch fish and
after eating their fill deposit the others
in their pouches under their bills and
carry them to their young. These
pouches will hold from three to eight
pounds of flsli. They are elastic and
■when distended to their utmost nearly
touch the ground. When empty, the
pouch lies close up under the big bill
and is merely a mass of wrinkles. It is
thte pouch that gives the pelican his
characteristic and disagreeable odor,
caused by particles of decaying fish.
The pelican's legs, are short and strong,
and its feet have large webs. It Is not
n fast swimmer or a rapid flier, but it
is practically tireless in both air and
water. On land it is awkward and un
wieldy.
How Frozen Insects Revive.
Experiments In reviving frozen in
sects by a naturalist show some sur
prising results. A large cecropia moth,
frozen- In the center of a snowball
until It was perfectly brittle, revived
in twenty seconds when bold near a
stove. Several newly hatched io moths
revived in a similar manner after being
frozen stiff and then thawed out. Sim
ilar experiments with nnts. butterflies
and bouse flies gave the .same results.
But the naturalist noticed that recent
ly hatched Insects resist cold better
than older ones.
The Organ.
Like most important inventions, that
of the organ is veiled In mystery. The
invention of the organ has been attrib
uted to Ctesibius, a barber of Alex
andria, about 250 B. C.i also to the
celebrated Archimedes, 220 B. C. It
is certain that the organ was brought
to Europe from the eastern or Greek
•empire and was applied to religious
dei'otions In churches about A. D. GSO.
Out of the Hymnbook.
A mlnlatur, having given out his "no
tices," was about to rend his hymn
vrhen ho was reminded of one notice
tie had forgotten. Stopping, lie made
this announcement, apologizing for his
forget fulness. Then, much to the
amusement of his nudlence, he began
to line out the hymn :ih follows:

Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises an area of
MH square inllos. It lies on the wps
tern slope of Sierra Novada raountalnß,
und emoraees within its territory all
thfl diversity of valley, foothill, nnd
high mountainous lands.
Climate— The climate of tho popu
lous portions of tbo county Un»U n» genial
and healthful as can be found anywhere
In California. As climate is one of tho
most valuable assets of this favored
state In attracting population, Atnador
stands second to no county in this re
gard. It should, and no doubt will In
time, when Its cllmutlc advantages are
i«ore thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, becomo n health resort not
only for those in loss favored states,
but for tho residents of other part 9of
California. The temperature alone the
central portion rarely falls below 30
degrees attovo zero In winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees in the sum
mer. Snow solciom falls In tho settled
districts, and never remains on the
ground for moro than a few hours. Of
oourso, In tho high mountain regions
of pastern Amador tho snowfall is very
heavy— which is characteristic of the
entire Slorra Nevada range. The sum
mer season is alway uccoinpaniod witli
cool nights; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs are rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
infrequent.
Gold Mining.— Tho county, although
rich in other sources or, wealth, com
paratively untouched, is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. The
deepest gold mines in America are lo
cated hero. The Kennedy mino is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
3000 feet below the surface, with every
indication that tbo pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold, tho county has contrib
uted fully *100,00(>000 to tho world's
supply of the precious metal. Tho
m'siios are, still yielding at the rate of
about two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
eight or ten mines operating on what
is called tho "mother lode." stretching
clear across tho county In a. north-east
erly direction a distance of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate between
4UO and 000 stamps, and furnish em
ployment for over 100(1 miners. This
industry is still in its infancy. The
unexplored territory, even along tho
main gold belt, is far in excess of tho
ground that has actually been worked
«»• prospected. The couuly offers to
i':iyone of the most inviting fields to
be found anywhere in the world for the
investment of capital iv tho fascinating
business of gold mining, not alone along
the mother lode, but also in the almost
untouched mineralized country ot the
east belt, some ton or twelve miles from
the main lode.
Besides gold, we have copper, de
posits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slato,
limestone, granite, and soapstone or
t;ilc— all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities. —The agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce anything that can be
grown in the most favored sections.
In tho foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetable are raised where irrigation
i r practicable along the numerous water
i-o.irses. Further up in the mountains,
at mi altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet, the
r.o-1 is admirably adapted for apples
and potatoes. A ready market for
many times tho quantity now raised of
these commodities can bo fouud fin the
various mining towns.
Grape culture and wlnemaking are
becoming 1 important industries, both
the grapes and wine commanding a
better price- thau .the product of tho
lowland;
Land is cheap compared with other
California lands. Improved farms may
bo secured for one-fourth the price
current in some places! Unimproved
lands can bo had from $•"> to $10 per
acre. It does not require a fortune to
buy a small ranch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agriculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts vow devoted to
cattle ranges might bo made the homes
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amador has a population of less thau
1:1000. Three fourths of this is concen
trated in a strip of three miles above
and below the mineral belt.
Jackson, tho county seat, lias about
2oOU inhabitants, and [sun Incorporated

are Butter Creek, Auuulor City, Dry

Why Kelly Didn't Sleep.
"One night I went in late to Father
Deuipsey's hotel. Every bed was full,
aud there wore 200 men sleeping on
tbo floor of the recreation room. Each
one of ihem had a newspaper under
him to beep off the dust of the floor.
I pointed to one little Irishman and re
marked that he did not seem to be
rcsliiis well.
"'What's your name, my man?' Fa
ther Dorupsey asked him.
'• 'Thomas Kelly) your reverence.'
•' 'You don't seem to he resting well,
Mr. Kelly. 1
•".I'll get to sleep after awhile, your
reverence,' he answered.
"'I don't believe you will unless
you change your bed. You're sleeping
on a Westliche Post,' answered Father
Dempsey."— St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Caught the General.
One of the regular army officers tells
a story of how the old stringent army
regulations once went against General
Stutt. One wet afternoon thnt soldier
was caught in the rain iv Washing
ton. He was in full uniform and was
well known, so, no cab being near, he
borrowed an umbrella. Arriving at
bis hotel, an underofflcer approached
him and calmly remarked:
•'General, you will consider yourself
under arrest for eight days for carry
ing sin umbrella while iv full uni
form."
His Solicitude.
"la It n fact that your mother-in-law
threw herself out of the third story

to catch her, but she had already

SOLDIERS IN BATTLE
How Men Feel and Act With
Death All About Them.
THE STORY OF A PRIVATE.
With the Beginning of the Fight
Cornea Fear, but That Soon Paste*
Away In the Eagerness For Killing.
Varying Effects of Wounds.
A narrative of the battle of Solfcrl
no ns told by a veteran survivor to
Robert Shacklcton nppenra in Har
per's. It Is, word for word, a chapter
of history ns seen by a man In thu
ranks. Incidents which Impressed him
are curious:
"Wo halted, and a Tyrolcso lying on
the ground cried out: 'I am dying.
Give me to drink.' Wherent my com
panion stooped to offer him a flnsk,
and as he stooped the Tyrolese struck
savagely nt him with his bayonet, bill
my companion Jumped back, nnd it
missed him, aud ho said, 'You Tyro
lose, you said you wanted a drink be
fore you died, and now you shall die
without tho drink.' And he stuck his
bayonet through him as a boy ■would
stick a pin through a fly.
'"The fighting soon began again, and
It was very fierce. It wa.s soon that
we came to know that we were to cap
ture; a little village nnd the hills about
the village. The Tillage was named
San Mnrltino, nnd there were walled
barns and gardens, and the .Vustrinns
were very strong there.
"Tho bursting of the shells was very
bad. Sometimes all of us close by
would bo thrown down ami be cov
ered with mud and earth, but most of
us would jump up again, not wounded,
but always there were some who
would not jump up again, because they
were wounded or dead.
"At the beginning of a battle a sol
dier feels afraid. At the beginning of
this battle I felt afraid, and I know
that other men felt afraid, though it
was not our first battle, and we know
what It wa.s to be under tiro.
"So It was that nt the beginning
we commended ourselves; we felt like
denth, but soon thiit passed away, and
WO thought no more of death, but only
of the killing of the Austrians.
"All around me men were killed.
Thoro were heads and arms blown off,
and men Hew Into pieces like the
smashing of a jug. But we did not
care.. We thought nothln: nf it 1
do not know that we ovui. know we
saw such things, but some of them
Come to me as I sH. with you and talk
of that loug day. We did not notice,
aud we did not think tbafnt auy mo
ment we too might have onr heads
blown off or be smashed into little
pieces like the breaking of a Jug.
"Once, when we rushed over the big
guns and killed the men who still
fought with us, we turned the guns
to tire on the Austrians as they flew
away, but they bad driven bits of steel
into the touchholes, and so we could
not fire them. They were of a cour
age, those Austrians.
"Only once In all that battle did 1
think much of what- I saw or heard,
and that "was when there was the
terrible screaming of a captain who
had his foot shot off. lie twisted and
turned as he cried out, and it was a
very bad sound. But it Is just as it
chances. I saw many men who were
hurst worse than that captain and
many who were blown into little bits,
but I did not trouble about them. It
Is just If it chances so.
"It is very often that a man does
not know that he is hurt I remember
that once there was a man near mo
with a great hole In his forehead, but
he ran right on with us with his bay
onet, aud I thought, 'He will fall dead.'
But after that I saw him no more, for
there was always the lighting.
"The storm aud the blackness, they
made of us a great mixing. Yes; it
was a very great tangling, for all lines
were lost, aud 1 know that sometimes
Austrians struck at Austrians and
sometimes Italians struck at Italians,
for wo were iv a very great mixing
and very fierce in the blackness of that
storm.
"We were told to lie down aud sleep.
So we lay down where we were, among
the dead and the wounded, among tho
Italians and the Austrians.
"And we slept. Yes; we were tired,
for we had fought hard for njl that
long, long day, and on that hill Hint at
last we had gained wo slept, and we
gave no heed to tho dend men or tho
wounded.
"The wounded they made very great
cries, and there were men sent to go
among them with lights. Some were
surgeons, nnd some were men to carry
them to the- field ho.stiit.ils. But the
most of us we lay there and slept, nnd
we were very tired, and we knew that
with the morning there might be an
other light."

Nov. 'J— Another pioneer has, croB«
ed the great divide iv the person of
lieujainiu Tyler of Oleta, who died at
his sou's residence on Monday evon
ing at si;: o'clock. Mr 'Jyler has
lived a half century within a few
miles of Oletfl, at what wns widely
known as I'yler's ranch. In tbe early
'id's be was eugngnd in lumbering,
having a saw mill on his flare, lie
therefrom furnished a great deal to
the surrounding country. He came
to tbe state, if 1 remember rightly in
a talk with him seroral years ago, in
1850 and settled down to mining just
above Nevada City. He said that at
time the long torn aud rocker were
the only source ot saving the gold
mined out from tbe bods ot the
streams. In its primitive wildnoss
men of that day were untutored In
any good way of saving tbe precious
metal that so many had come booking.
Dirt he said that would pay live or
ton cents to the pau was cast away
as refuse. One progressive man see
ing his chance of making a little
l'ottuuo, secured tin option on all the
refused dirt that so many had cast
away as uuworthy ot working. Ho
dug tbe first long ditch of that vicin
ity being in length three or four
miles, and invented tbe sluice that is
now so commonly used by miners
and proceded to wash up tbo cast
away dirt that he had secured an
option on. Tbe consequences were,
he made a foituue out of the venture.
No man was hardly bettor kuown
than Mr Tyler. He was a man of
steeling qualities being the best of
citizen.
To-night is election night many a
man will lose bis political bead at
tbe polls, for halt only win.

On Wednesday uf tniß woek two
men woro discovered in the act of
robbing the plates of tho mill at the
Uwiu mine by the 'Superintendent.
One of the men escaped, though the
superintendent took a shot at him,
but the other wag caught and helri
while tbe sheriff was sent for.
Sheriff Jones and deputy Croseett left
at once for the scene, on teceivina
word, and brought back the man who
gives tbe name of Fiuck, and claims
to be a German- The man is quite
well known about here, and is

True politeness is not the product
of a refrigerator or a cold Btora«e
plant. A man may follow the rules
aud regulations of society, and tho
book ot etiquette, and still be quite
a disagreeable fellow. But his is
only a shaai politeness, for true
politeness includes kindness, good
nature, sincerity, and is a help and a
pleasure to those who come in con
tact with it, while the counterfeit
article frequently has the apposite
effect on all couoerued.

ELECTION IN JACKSON.
Not only wna tho election during
• lie campaign tbo quietest known In n
notional contest, bat throughout tbo
dny of the election nnd during the
evening when tho returns were being
received thero was scarcely a ripple
ot o.xcitornent obaei vnble. There was
none ot tbo hurrahing which has been
olinrnotorlatlrj of times past. Only a
few could be got out to tHko notice
Of Hie ntuir m irom the big ci.--li.in
t-tntes. The ouly exciUmeut was over
tin) siipcrvisorphip, when John
.Strolim was receiving tho congratula
tions of bis supporters and lrieuds
over bis signal victory, and taking
them around to ii jubilee over the
outcome. As for tho presidential
contest, tbo vory first telegraphic
trmssflge was decisive of tbo result.
11 limned conclusively that the drift
in Xow York and the middlo west was
"strongly toward tbo republican
ticket, and that settled it. Tbe
liryan local politicians lost all inter
est in tbo tight. They werb down
aud out for the third time, aud a
mure crestfallen combine could hard
ly be iuißgined. J'hey weuded their
disconsoltite way homeward at a\\ un
usually eHrly hour, considering the
oouuslooj no doubi. wondering what,
new-fangled scheme could be con
cocted iv times to come by Uryan
aud democracy in a fresh ull'ort to
fool the voters. On the republican
side there were no outbrustH of feel
ing. It was no more than they v.x
pented, no more than they bad a right
to expect from intelligent men ex
eroising tbe sacred right of sulfiago
for the good ,of the natiou. About
half-past nine, the telegraphic wires
tv Jackson got mixed up. aud all
communication wad thereafter shut
alt. JJut. it made uot the slightest
difference. Enough dispatches bad
lieeti received to show that Taft bad
been elected president by a tremend
ous popular vote, and tbe republican
cause had triumphed al along tbe
line. The country was safe, and all
commercial and business interests
were placed iv a position to movo
along as prosperously iv tbe future,
as they buve been enabled to do in
the past.

SERVANTS' SIGN LANGUAGE.
Peculiaritie* of Employers and Tour-
lata Noted by Marks.
Servants and hotel porters In many
cities of Europe have a sign language
as complete ns that of the American
tramp.
"It Is not generally known," said a
Courier, "tbnt servants aro In tne habit
of giving useful tips to their succes
sors nnd to the man who delivers the
jrroeertes and meat by marks on tho
bncl: entrance. In most of the big
Parts li.-il.s nnd apartments, such ns
Americans like to take for the season,
the back door is literally covered with
barely perceptible signs which nobody
but the initiated can understand.
"A freshly engaged domestic knows
exactly what to expect, whether his
masters aro easy or hard to please,
whether it is 'monsieur' or 'madame'
who is hard to get along with. Other
signs tell whether the food Is good or
bad, whether the work is difficult or
not, etc.
"The boy from the grocer's or the
baker's or the butcher's will also bo
informed whether he can expect a big
tip or not.
"Tho system is even more developed
among hotel servants. A family arriv
ing from Italy, nfter having refused to
give what some Italian porter consid
ered a sufficient tip, will have the fact
advertised in every hotel he visits in
Switzerland or France. A little mark
on the trunk is nil that Is needed."—
Philadelphia Ledger.
AMERICAN FRENCH.
The Struggles of a New Yorker In a
Paris Restaurant.
He gazed complacently nt the gay
labels on his trunks. "Funny how you
hear in Paris"— so he continued his
reminiscences of travel— "our thin
American accent struggling with the
sonorous French tongue. You hear
qneer mistakes, too— no end of 'em.
The queerest I came across was made
by a New York man.
"This tourist at the Chatham wanted
to say, 'lam hungry. 1 lie should have
said, 'J'al falm.' Then the waiter
would have brought him a meal at
once. What he did say was:
" 'Je suls fameux, garcon.' He said
there, 'I'm famous, waiter.' And the
waiter, impressed, bowed and smiled.
'Congratulations, sir.'
"No food came. Ho must have made
an error, so ho tried jigain:
" 'Garcon, j'al une femnie.' That
meant he had a wife. The waiter said
he was sure she was a winner.
"Rather red now, he took a third
dive:
"'Jo suls femme.' This time the
New Yorker said he was a woman.
" 'And madam dresses In this way 1
for comfort's sake?' the waiter In
quired, with a gallant smile.— New
York Press.
"Chuck It, Duke!"
While the Duke of Counaught was
In Cairo he went for a stroll one morn
ing, and on his way back to his quar
ters he came face to face with an old
englishman wearing the ribbon of the
Indian mutiny on his breast. The
■Juke stopped and spoke to the man
about his military service for some
tittle time. Presently the man said,
not knowing, of course, to whom he
was speaking, "Are you in the army
yourself, then, sir?" The duke smiled
and admitted that he was. "Getting
on all right?" was the next question.
The duke smiled again and said that
he had not very much to grumble at,
on the whole, though perhaps he was
not doing quite so well as he could
wish. "No. aud you never will, my
boy," was the surprising retort of the
?eteran. "What you want In the army
today Is either brains or a tremendous
imount of influence behind you. You
may take my tip. old chap, and chuck
U.'"-London T. P. O.
Fencing With Umbrellas.
Recently a French publication print
ed a picture of some American girls
fencing with umbrellas and stated that
they were trying to acquire thus the
necessary skill and assurance to parry,
with a simple gesture, an attack of
Apaches.
It also stated that this sport was not
born In America; that for several years
in France a noted fencing mistress.
Mme. Guillemot, at the same time that
the taught fencing with the sword for
hygienic reasons and for personal do
fense, also taught her pupils to "play"'
with the umbrella.
The article finishes by saying that it
is certainly "piquant" that this modem
application of an ancient sport was
taught by -a Parlslenno loug before
America claimed tho original Idea.
Spirit of the Open Life.
The great charm of scenery and tho
rountry life Is the moral fueling that
seems to pervade it. This has prevail
.'d through all English literature from
Chaucer to Wordsworth and down to
our own times. It has cast its npoll
over almost all of our Canadian poets,
tvho have wooed nature In her moat se
cret haunts and studied her minutest
caprices.— Montreal witness.

A WOMAN'S TACT.
And tlie Way Sho Explained Her Dl-
plomacy to Her Husband.
It being n holiday, the blundering
man made calls with his wife. The
first place they went the hostess said,
"Julia Is engaged."
"Is she. Indeed?" said the man's wife
radiantly. "Which one did she finally
accept 77
The next place they were Informed
that Margaret was engaged, nnd again
(he man's wife benmed sympathetical
ly and murmured: "Is she, Indeed?
Which one did she nocept?" At' the
third place It was the news of Jessie's
engagement that was broken to them.
As before, the man's wife put the ques
tion. "Which one did she finally take?"
On their way homo the man said:
"Why did you ask 'which one' every
time n new engagement was sprung
im us? Are those girls so attractive
that men were fulling over each other
in the scramble to got them for their
wives?"
"Not at nil." said his wife. "I don't
suppose either of them ever had but
one offer, and It is a wonder she g'.t
that. I shouldn't be surprised If the
men back out even now before tlie
wedding day. But you see, dear. I had
to be diplomatic. Those people can do
me many favors. Tho surest way to
Ilinke myself solid with them Is to pre
tend to think their girls so popular that
every man In town was crazy to marry
thorn."
"With my opportunities downtown,"
groaned the man. "if I linti your genius
we'd bo millionaires inside of six
months."— New York Sun.
FOES OF THE LEVEES.
Sources of Danger to the Artificial
Banks Along the Mississippi.
"People who know little about our
system of levees, the artificial banks
built to confine the flood waters that
pour into the Mississippi, no doubt
imagine that the heavy ralus nre the
only enemy with which the levees have
to contpnd," said a Baton Rouge man.
"On the contrary, the levees, both
during times of flood and low water,
are subject to the Incessant attacks of
living foes, the destructive work of
which costs millions of dollars. Those
roes iiru alligators^ turtles, muskrats.
field ruts, li'iish water terrapin and
crawfish. Oi' all these l>urrowers that
prey on the levees, excavating within
them goodly chambers or tunnels, the
crawfish do the most damage, with tbe
turtles arid terrapins a good second.
The harm done by the alligators Is
comparatively small.
"In repairing the banks crawfish
holes are often found of Immense size.
It is tliese hollow spaces that in time
of freshets cause a caving In and break
of the levees, which of course bring
on 'an Inundation of all the adjacent
country. The worst part of the busi
ness Is that no way of exterminating
these pests has yet been found, and
the only thing to be done Is to try to
keep them away from the bauks as
much as possible."— Baltimore Ameri
can.
The Inquisitive Woman.
Street car conductors regard inquisi
tive women passengers with supersti
tious dread. The other day a fuse
blew out in a Broadway car, and that
car was hitched on as a. trailer to the
one fahead. Presently a woman be
gan to ask questions.
"What would happen," she said, "if
the fuse were to blow out in that car
ahead? What would become of us?
Would the car ahead of that be able
to drag both of these cars?"
"I don't know," said the conductor.
"But don't worry. We -won't have a
chance to find out. A double accident
of that kind has never happened to a
car of mine yet. and It isn't likely to
happen once In a hundred year's."
Just then there came an explosion
ahead; and both cars came to a stand
still. The fuse had blown out.
"Confound that woman!" growled
tho conductor. "That is all her fault.
This wouldn't have happened if she
hadn't asked so mnny fool questions.

GRANTING PATENTS.
Invention •• Distinguished From
Mere Mechanical Skill.
A patent cannot properly be granted
protecting the product of inoro ine
chnnlcnl skill ns distinguished from In
vention. Difficulty Is frequently ex
perienced In distinguishing between
the two, mid the supreme test for de
termining whether a particular device
Is (In,- result of mechanical skill Is not
whether nn ordinary mechanic could
tnnUo the device If It were suggested
to him, but whether he would make
It without ftUKgestionn stive those
which nre prompted by his skill and
knowledge of his nrt.
For example. If a man constructs out
of Irou a machine which had previous
ly liocn inndo out of wood he does not
thereby become an Inventor In a legal
sense, been tine everybody knows that
any constructor cnu build a machine
out of Iron lnstend of wood. But
suppose that gunpowder had. just re
cently been discovered nnd that the
man who Invented It had applied for
and obtained a patent upon It
lie might linro claimed, "I combine
saltpeter, milphur nnd charcoal In a
certain way and produce it startling
result," and It would bo no answer. If
an action for Infringement were
brought, for the lnfrlnger to say that
every chemist could mate the powder
after he had been shown how. for.
If every chemist did not have the
knowledge as well as the skill, the
originating of the powder constituted
Invention.— Exchange.
PECULIAR TREES.
They Yield Bread, Cutter nnd Milk,
Soap and Candles.
The hrendfrult tret* of Ceylon Is very
remarkable. Its fruit Is baked and
eaten a3 we eat bread and Is equally
good aud nutritious. In Barbutu, South
America, Is a tree which; by piercing
the trunk, produces milk, with which
the inhabitants feed their children.
In the Interior of Africa Is a tree
which produces excellent butter. It
resembles the American oak, and its
fruit, from which the butter Is pre
pared, is not unlike the olive. Park,
the great traveler, declared that the
butler surpassed any made in Eng
land from cow's milk. At Sierra
Leone is the cream fruit tree, the
fruit of which is quite agreeable in
taste.
At Table Bay. near the Cape of Good
Hope; is a small tree the berries of
which make excellent candles. It is
also found In the Azores. The vege
table tallow tree also grows la- Suma
tra, in Algeria and In China. In the
island of Chtisan large quantities, of oil
and tallow nre extracted from Its fruit,
which is gathered in November or
December, when tho tree has lost all
its leaves. The bark of a tree In China
produces a beautiful soap. Trees of
tho saplndus or soap berry order also
grow In the north of Africa. They are
amazingly prolific, and their. milt con
tains about as per cent of caponin.
A Bachelor and a Widow.
"Bachelors." said the widow, "are
the most sensitive people on earth. At
any rate, the bachelors I know are.
I dined with one not long ago. Dur
ing the first part of the meal he seem
ed uneasy.
" 'If any of my friends see me,' lie
said, "they will think I am dining
with some other man's wife.'
"'Why?' I asked.
"lie pointed to my wedding ring.
" 'Shall J take It off?' I asked.
" 'Would you mind?' said he.
" "Not at all, 1 I said and slipped off
the ling.
"Since then when going anywhere
with that bachelor or any other bache
lor I save him from embarrassment
by taking off my wedding ring before
we start 1 find they appreciate my
consideration for their feelings. Now,
If that isn't sensitiveness raised to tho
ninth power I'd like to know what it
is."— New York Press.
The Flow of Rivers.
The flow of rivers, as might be sup
posed. Is the slowest at the bottom of
the water aud highest at the top. The
average velocity of the entire stream
is found, as a rule, at about six-tenths
of the depth. Tho friction of the bot
tom which retards the movement of
the deepest water is much greater, rel
atively to tho whole volume of the
stream, in a shallow river than in a
deep one.
Womanlike.
"In my opinion." said Jones, "a wo
man's club to bo successful should aim
at something fur removed from fe
male suffrage."
"I do not agree with you," retorted
Miss Strong, with set lip. "That alone
should bo Its object."
"Exactly, but if It alms at something
Dlse it is more likely, to hit that."—Plill

Tho conclusion that light e.xertß
pressure was reached by Clerk Wax
well :>r> years ago, but many attempts
to meßSiire tho pressure gave only
doubtful results. It wns at Just
shown by liobedewtbat in Mm tropics
tbo sun's rays have a pressure Of
about tbieo pounds per square mile.
J'ho sun's attraction upon the earth
is millions of times greater, but tbo
attraction acts upon the mass while
tiio total radiatiou prnssuro depends
upon tho tiuriace exposed, so chat
when matter is reduced to Hue dust
tlio radiatiou pressure tnav exceed the
attraction. Thus it is that tbo sun's
rays push the nebulous tail of a
comet away fioni tbo denser bead.

The electric gun, which sbootH
without powdur or projectile and is
already a popular peuuy-in-tbe-slot
toy in I'arls, is not designed for wai
fare or hunting, but serves well for
target practice. The gun, which may
be of any kind, is mounted mi a
special stand, while tne special target
is placed 20 or 25 yaids or more away.
Tho target is perforated with 19 holes
in concentric circles and four outside
holes for stray allots, mid behind each
hole is an iucaudesceut lamp in addi
tion to a bell at the ceutrul hole.

in a horizontal plato in the base ot

actly to the bull's-eye, a needle pro
ioctiug downward is over tlm central
button, but as the gun's position is
shifted tho ueodlo is moved over
other hultous. On pressing the
trigger the noorJle is forced down
ward, the contact so made lighting
up the lamp aimed at. Tho reckless

sack of gold and went within about
thirty feet of tho tent aud made as
good a speech as I could to Induce the
lady to come out. assuring her that
all the men about her were gentlemen,
that they had seen no ladies for so
many months aud that the presence
of one reminded them of their mothers
and sweethearts at home. I told her
that the bag of gold was hers on con

claim It. Her husband urged her to
be brave, but when she finally ven

were so vociferous that she was scared

"She repeated this performance sev

back and forth while the hoys looked
on In admiration, when I finally gave
her the bag. with all- the good wishes

LOCAL EDITORIAL COLUMN.
THE NATIONAL ELECTION
The result of Tuesday's election must be exceedingly grati
fying, not only to the republican party, but to the solid com
mercial interests throughout the country. The democratic
campaign under Bryan was waged along absolutely imprac
ticable lines. He posed as the special champion of the work
ing classes, thinking to capture their votes — knowing that
they had enough to elect — by the promise of good times for
them, and hard times for the big employers. But the labor
ing men refused to be fooled bysuch impossible notions. Bry
an made the fatal mistake of trying to hoodwink the level
est headed workingmeu in the world, with the assistance of
a few labor union agitators, who imagined they could do a
whole lot in swinging the voters to their way of thinking.
A few hidebound politicians of the democracy really believed
Bryan had a good shown to win, and staked their money on
the event, nnd lost, as they deserved to lose in such an i
issue.
But the ballots show a tremendous landside for the repub
licans. Taft is elected by majorities almost rivaling the vote
for Roosevelt four years ago. He has swept the following
states, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, In
diana, lowa, Kansas, Maiue, Massachusetts, Michigan, Min
nesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia,
Wisconsin aud Wyoming, with 301 electoral votes, with the
two southern states of Maryland and Missouri still iv doubt.
The official count, may yet place these two states, with their
26 votes, in the republican column. Brj'au has only 153
votes. He carried only Nebraska, Colorado, aud Nevada,
outside of the south, and the two last named states are still
debateable, owing to the close vote. Cougress is strongly re
publican in both branches. California sends eight republi
cans to congress, and gives 80,000 plurality for Taft. The
democratic party is not only defeated, but utterly routed —
bankrupt alike in principles aud in votes. It has gone to
pieces on the rocks of Bryauisin.
With this issue the Amador Ledger enters upon the fifty
fourth year of its existence.
