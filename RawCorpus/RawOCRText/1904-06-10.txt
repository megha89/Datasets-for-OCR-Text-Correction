A PUb That Could Talk.
A' natural curiosity captured on the
coast of Africa on May 5, 1854, by
Bignor Cavana and exhibited in all the
great cities of Europe during the years
1850, 1860, 1861 and 1862, where it was
advertised as the "talking flsh," was
in reality a species of the African seal,
well known to naturalists on account
of ita wonderful powers of mimicry.
This particular animal was about
twelve feet in length and weighed
something over 800 pounds. It had a
fine, dogllke head and large, beautiful
black eyes, which seemed to sparkle
with intelligence whenever the crea
ture was spoken to by any one. It was
very docile and when told to dance
would roll over and over in its bath
tub, with first tail and then head above
the water, all the time chattering as
though enjoying the sport as much as
the spectators did. It soon learned
many odd tricks and, it is claimed,
learned to articulate at least three
words very plainly — viz, "mamma,"
"papa" and "John," the last being its
keeper's name. When told to pray it
would clasp its flippers In the attitude
of supplication and put on a sanctimo
nious look.
A Marvel of Woo 4 Cnrvtntt.
.One of the greatest works of Henry
Vorbruggen Is the carved pulpit of the
grand parochial church at Brussels.
The whole design Is an allegorical
scene. At the base are Adam and Ere,
life size, expelling the angel, while
grim Death himself may be seen hover
ing In the rear. The first pair bear
upon their shoulders a hollow globe,
tb* 1 «avity being the place where the
preacher stands while delivering bis
sermons. From the globe rises- a tree
sustaining a canopy, which in turn sup
ports two figures— one of an angel nnd
tbe other a female representing Truth.
Above all this are the Virgin and the
Infant Jesus crushing the serpent's
head, with a cross.
One Way to Break Glaaa.
It is scarcely credible, but it is a fact,
that a glass can be broken by the voice.
If you strike a thin, wineglass while
you hold It by the stem It will emit a
certain, w>te—^n most cases a pretty,
deep one. On approaching the glass
rapidly to your mouth and shouting In
to it the tame note as loudly as possi
ble, the vibrations of the glass being
thereby extended, it will be shivered
into fragments. This used to be a
favorite experiment of Lablache, the
renowned basso, vrbOk when in com
pany with hla friends, thus broke one
after the* other all the glasses that
were banded to hlm %
Our Oldoot Bit of Literature.
The book of Job, as It 1b Incorporated
In the Bible, Is believed to be the most
ancient literary work In existence. It
la known to have been written prior to
the Pentateuch and prior to the pro
mulgation of the law. In profane liter
ature the poems of Homer are the
most ancient that have come down to
our day, though the names of others
still older are In existence. The Penta
teuch was written about the year 145
B. C, and the' Homeric poems about
640 years later.
The HeaTcni Seen From the Sea.
' Every one who has been much at sea
knows something of the peculiar splen

circumstances. The clearness of the
air In fair weather and the flatness and
distance of the horizon tend to heighten
this effect " ..

Odd Names In Delaware.
Delaware has a curious collection of
odd • surnames. There is a. family of
Colts In Kent county. The Peppers
and Mustards have long lived neigh
bors In Sussex, and there are Peaches
In Newcastle county, lnauspiciously set
tled north of. the peach belt. One man
named his three sons for the several
counties of the state, and Delaware is
an occasional Christian name. . A girl
whose name was Leonora Missouri
Cannon provoked from a stranger the
prompt declaration that the name was
sentimental, patriotic and explosive.
Real Balm of Gllead.
. The real balm of Gilead is the dried
Juice of a low shrub, It is said, which
grows In Syria. It Is very valuable
and scarce, for the amount of balm
yielded by one shrub never exceeded
■ixty drops a day. According to Jo
sephus, the balm or balsam of Gilead
was one of the presents given by the
queen of Sheba to King Solomon. The
ancient Jewish physicians prescribed
It evidently for dyspepsia and melan
cholia.

It is much easier for a woman to confide
in the average man than in the average
woman. She knows that the man will re-
spect her confidences and keep them to
himself. He is strong, has more experience
of the world and can help the woman who
needs advice. There is every reason why
women should not trust their delicate
constitutions in the hands of unskilled
persons. It requires a thorough medical
education to appreciate and understand
the womanly organism. When a woman
has ills and pains' that she cannot beat
i— when life seems dark for every woman,
she should confide her troubles to a
physician of standing in the community,
or one who has a national reputation. Cer-
tainly it would not be the part of wisdom
to confide in an ignorant person without
medical education simply because she was
a woman. There is every reason why she
should write to some great specialist, one
who has made the diseases of women a
specialty for a third of a century, like Dr.
R. V. Pierce, founder of the Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute, of Buffalo, N. Y.
All his correspondence is held sacredly con-
fidential, and he gives his advice free and
without charge. v ,". -■■

fully warranted in offering to pay $500 in
cash for any case of these diseases which
he cannot cure.

THE IONE ROAD.
A trip over the road between
Jackson and lone must convince any
unprejudical mind that it is in a de
plorable condition. The truth is ap
parent almost the entire length of
the thoroughfare that it is practi
cally worn out. For the greater
part of the distance the wagon way
is also the water way. It is dis
couraging, after the years of special
taxes levied for the main purpose of
. putting this road in good condition;
after pouring out money without
stint in the vain effort of making
. this artery of traffic a macadamized
road that would continue in good
shape, with slight repairing, for
• many years, to find that its metal
• veneering has been ground into dust;
that no semblance of a turnpike
■ character remains. Its crown — if it
ever had any worth speaking of —
has been converted into a hollow
way, and everything tends to show
that the vast sums of money ex
pended upon it — while admitting
. that some change for the better has
resulted as compared with former
days— have fallen lamentably short of
meeting public expectations. It is
useless to look for its transforma
; tion into a fairly good road under
' the existing road system. Its con
' dition to-day is a standing protest
to the present wofully defective
road law. We have not got, and we
never will get, adequate returns for
the money expended. Thousands of
dollars have been wasted in trying
to water it; large sums have been
thrown away in sprinkling it with
oil; but the one fact that faces the
casual observer to-day is that neither
water nor oil can materially aid it at
present. What it wants is road
building material of the hardest
character that can be had.
A rumor is afloat to the effect that
a movement is contemplated in of
ficial quarters to spend the money
in the special road fund in pouring
oil on this troublesome highway. It
will cost a couple of thousand dollars
to put sufficient oil to quiet the dust
for the summer season. And that
is the sum total of the benefit that
will accrue from the expenditure.
We have no hesitation in denouncing
any movement in this direction — as
the roadway now stands— as a reck
less waste of money. Supervisor
Amick is reported to be opposed to
this scheme. He wants the money
devoted to permanent improvement
, — something beyond the mere laying
of a few clouds of dust in the sum
mer season. And we believe his
judgment in this respect will be sus
tained by nine-tenths of the tax
payers. The only campaign of opera
tions that will command support is
to deal with this vital artery of
traffic with the view of keeping it in
the best travelable condition, with
the funds available, during the win
ter months, as well as the period of
traction engine traffic. Ths experi
ence of one season has exploded the
idea that the traction engine is an
important helper in the road-making
business. It is the same as any
other kind of heavy travel. Its ten
dency is to wear out a road, not to
improve it. And the peculiar tootb
• like construction of its broad tires
seems to aid in the disintegration of
the road bed. Still we do not claim
that the traction engine should be
ignored in the expenditure of road
money, but we do contend that the
tiding over the wet season with the
least possible inconvenience to the
• freighting business is the vital point
to be ever kept in view in the dis
bursement of the road funds of the
three districts involved.
COMMUNICATION.
Plymouth, June 8, 1904.
Editor Amador Ledger: —
By your permission please let me in
your columns correct the article pub
lished in the Amador Ledger June 3,
1904, regarding the misfortune of Mr.
J. J. Ekel, which happened some
twenty years ago at Mr. Jack Bert's
place in the town of Plymouth, Cal.,
Mr. Ekel at the time of meeting with
his misfortune was not in the employ
of Mr. Bert as his attorney, but went
.there at the request of Mr. J. H. Hol
man, who was then the constable of
this township, to keep the peace, quiet,
and order. 'We consider Mr. Ekel
acted as any other citizen would when
called on by an officer of the law.
The above statement I verify.
Signed: J. H. Holman.

License Ordinances.
The supervisors at their meeting
Tuesday, after deliberating for two
months on the objectional features of
the old ordinance, passed what they
believe to bo an ordinance, that will
stand the test of law, and tend to ele
vate the liquor business. The new or
dinance goes into effect on the first of
August, when all. persons, desiring- to
sell spirituous or malt liquors in Ama
dor county will be expected to comply
with its provisions. All applications
for licenses for new places were laid
over until the August meeting of tbe
board. Space will not permit us to
print the ordinance this week, the
main features of the new law is as
follows:
Requiring the applicant to furnish
$1000 bonds with two sureties.
Requiring the applicant, to be filed at
least 5 days before the August meeting.
Petition to be signed by at least 10
out of 20 respectable citizens, who are
taxDayers or heads of families living
nearest to the place where tbe business
is to be conducted.
Not to allow any minor child under
eighteen years of age to visit the place
of business and not to sell give or deliv
er to any child under eighteen male or
female any intoxicating drinks.
Not under any conditions to grant
licenses for the selling, furnishing, giv
ing away or distributing, of any malt
or fermented liquors or wines at any
dance hall.
In any city or town a retail license
will cost $15 per quarter, payable in
advance.
At any tavern or watering place out
side the city or ; town limits a license
will cost $7.50 per quarter, payable in
advance.
All retail licenses carry with them
the privilege of wholesale.
Where any lady 19 employed in
saloons as bar-tender, waitress, dancer
or singer, $300 per quarter will be
charged payable in advance.
The district attorney has closely
scrutinized every clause, paragraph
and selection and does not believe that
it can be shown to be unconstitutional.
The peddlers and other licenses were
enacted separately, so that if one
should by chance be declared to be con
trary to law, it would not, invalidate
the other. Chairman Moore says he
has given this subject earnest con
sideration, has listened attentively to
both sides of the controversy and be
lieves that the board has done the very
best that it is possible for them to do
under the circumstances.
For a Hundred Years.
For a hundred years or more Witch
Hazel has been recognized as a super
ior remedy, but it remained for E. C.
DeWitt & Co. of Chicago, to discover
how to combine the virtues of Witch
Hazel with other antiseptics, in the
form of a salve. De Witt's Witch Hazel
Salve is the best salve in the world for
sores, cuts, burns, bruises and piles.
The high standing of this salve has
given rise to counterfeits, and the public
is advised to look for the name "De-
Witt" on the package, and accept no
other. Sold by City Pharmacy.

Indigestion Causes
Catarrh of tne
Stomach.
For many years it has been supposed that
Catarrh of the Stomach caused indigestion
and dyspepsia, trat the truth is exactly the
opposite. Indigestion causes oatarrh. Re-
peated attacks of Indigestion inflames the
mucous membranes lining the stomach and
exposes the nerves of the stomach, thus caus-
ing the glands to secrete mucin instead of
the juices of natural digestion. Thii ia
called Catarrh of the Stomach.
Kodol Dyspepsia Cure
relieves all inflammation of the mucous
membranes lining the stomach, protects tha
nerves, and cures bad breath, sour risings,
a sense of fullness after eating, indigestion,
dyspepsia and all stomach troubles.
Kodol Digests What Yon Eat
Make the Stomach Sweet.

Big Game.
Game Warden Arditto, when dressed
in hunting attire, is an ideal looking
nimrod. No one would ever suspect
him of being an officer of the law, a
friend of the innocent dove, and a pro
tector of the bounding deer. Two
years ago Chezro Arditto accepted an
appointment at the hands of the board
of supervisors as game warden of Ama
dor county. At that time he took a
solemn oath to protect and defend the
game, and enforce the game laws of
the state and county as he iound them
upon the statute books in so far as it
lay within his power so to do. Arditto 's
sense of hearine is very acute, and on
Saturday, while standing on the side
walk, he distinctly heard several re
ports of gun shots fired in the direction
of Mattley's field. Dressing himself in
hunter's attire, with gun in hand, he
boldly announced to his friends that
he was going after doves and would
not return until he had secured his
game. His friends stood in amazement
to see the officer of the law go forth \o
carry out his threat in supposed direct
violation of what he was sworn to de
fend. On the outskirts of town he
called his deputy, O. Reichling, to his
assistance, and together they went
forth to ascertain from whence the gun
shot reports had come. They had not
gone far before they discovered Chris
Bon in the act of shooting doves in
violation of the, law. Arditto had
found his man; he also found seven
doves. He forthwith made himself
known, and placed Mr-. Bon under ar
rest. As the trio walked through
town on their way to the justice' office
the by-standers took in the situation,
and applauded the warden for the man
ner in which he had carried out his
deception. Mr. Bon plead guilty and
paid a $25 fine, lost his doves, and wont
home satisfied that it was illegal to
slaughter doves before the Ist of July.
Barrett was on hand as usual to
claim the birds, but Arditto has read
all the law books from ' Blackstone to
the county hospital reports, and under
stands his business. He gave the doves
to the sick and needy, and remarked
to Mr. Barrett that he might be able
to fool all of the people some of the
time, and some of the people all of the
time, but that there was one fellow
that never got fooled but once.
Deafness Cannot be Cured
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear
There is only ono way to cure deafness,
and that is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous lining of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube' is in
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can be
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars
for any case of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot.be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free.

Death of Louis Martell.
Louis Martell, one of the oldest and
most respected pioneers of Amador
county, died at the home of his daugh
ter, Mis. M. Riestra, near Gait, on
Friday evening, June 3, 1904, alter an
illness of but twelve days.
Mr. Martell was born at Montreal,
Canada, on March 2, 1820, and at the
time of his death was 84 years and 3
months old. He came to California in
1850, and ■ for 22 years conducted a
blacksmith business in the town of
Jackson. He th«-n removed to Sutter
Creek and enquired in thu same busi
ness, which hu continui'd to follow until
old age t'cminrii'fl him that he must
give way to others. At the time of his
death he still owned the building
wherein he had earned the means that
enabled him to support a large and in
teresting family. He was a kind
hearted, generous man. It is said of
him that he gave to others enough to
have made him a wealthy man. He
gave because it was a |>l-asnre to him
to give, yet he nevi-i- boasted of his
generosity. He spnnt the last few
years of bis lifu with his children. It
was while visiting with his. youns^st.
daughter that be accidentally Ml from
the bed. striking in such a way as to
cause paralysis. He lingore'l fortwplvw
days, and peacefully gave up life's
struggle, surrounded by all bis chil
dren. He leaves to mourn his loss one
son, Louis N. Martell, of Mar lull's sta
tion, four daughters, twenty-two
grandfebilrlren and eighteen great
grandchildren, besides a host <if friends
who had known him from their child
hood. His remains wert) interred in
the Catholic cemetery Monday, by the
side of those of bis wife who died sev-
Advertising the County.
The board of supervisors on Monday
appropriated $250 for the purpose of
advertising, in a way, the various re
sources of Amador county. During the
first week in September the Knight
Templars of America will bold a grand
conclave in San Francisco. It is under
stood that people from all parts of the
world will be present. El Dorado coun
ty has appropriated a like amount, and
with this money El Dorado Command
ery No. 4 proposes to have compiled a
souvenir booklet setting forth the var
ious resources, the natural advantages,
and the climatic condition of the two
counties. The coromandery will pur
chase thousands of small baskets, fill
them with fruit, wines, and olive oil,
and in each basket will be placed one
of these booklets. To each visiting
member who calls at El Dorado head
quarters will be given one of these bas
kets, and at the same time they will be
asked to register the name of so. no
friend, to whom one of tbese booklets
will be nent by mall. If any persons
call who are not going directly to their
room, they will be asked to leave their
number and a basket will he sent to
them by pages employed for that pur
pose. None but Amador and El Dorado
fruits, wines, and oil will be used by this
commandery. It is thought that in
toTs-way much good can be atvomplish
ed. The supervisors do not wish to
have this taken us a precedent that Hkf
donations will be made for similar pur
poses, but rather an experimental o
commemoration ol an event, the like of
which may never occur in this state
ft eain. ... \\

Vandalism.
On Sunday morning, between the
hours of 1 and 3 o'clock, some person
bent on mischief entered the Jackson
stage barn and proceeded in his own
devilish way to destroy whips, har
ness, cushions and trimmings, think
ing perhaps that he would prevent the
stage from making its daily trip that
day. The damage was discovered in
time however to secure the services
of a harness-maker, and all necessary
repairs were made in time for the stage
to be off at the appointed hour. Just
what object any person could have in
doing this cannot be conjectured. If
it was for revenge against owner or
driver for some fancied wrong, it was
certainly a most cowardly way of seek
ing it. Cutting the harness might en
danger the lives of many, and perhaps
friends of the one doing the mischief.
On the other band, if the perpetrator
has the spirit of <lpst ruction- born
within him, he was working to satis
fy his desire to do something that
would inconvenience others. Mr.
Raab, the owner of the stage line, is a
gentleman who by hard work and hon
est dealings with his fellow man has ac
cumulated considerable property. He
has no known enemies, and is at a loss
to know why any one should seek to do
him injury. It has been his one desire
since purchasing the line to give his
customers the best service possible for
their money. He estimates his im
mediate loss at between $30 and $40.
Chris Meiss, the driver, is a young
man of ability, a thorough reinsman,
always at his post of duty, ever work
ing to carry out the instructions of his
employer, and always paying respect
ful attention to the requests of those
who take passage with him. Every
effort will be made to bring the per
petrator or perpetrators of this crime
to justice. It may take a little time,
but t}io clew Is strong and the fear of
being grasped by the strong arm of
justice will be a far greater punishment
than to be confined within prison walls.
Home on a Visit.
Edmund G. McMillan of San Fran
cisco, son of Jackson's popular photo
grapher, is spending his vacation with
his parents. Master McMillan began
work as chore boy In the Western
National Bank of San Francisco when
but thirteen years of age, at a salary of
$15 per month. After three years of
faithful service be has reached the
position of first assistant book-keeper,
at $75 per month. His young lady
friends gave him a party Thursday
evening. He will resume his duties at
the bank Monday morning.
Baseball Next Sunday.
Placerville vs. Jackson will be the
attraction on Dwyer's hill Sunday
afternoon, June 12th. This will be the
first game by the newly organized Jack
son club, with Frank Burgin as man
ager. Both teams tiro made up of good
men, and the game ought to be an in
teresting one. The Jacksons will line
up as follows:
Hookins.. l>itchnr.*. _ Brook s. _ oatnhor:
Grillo, Ist base; Bradshaw, 2d base;
Santhfo, 3rd base; Westerberjj, short

Perano, right field.
Blue rock shooting before and after
the game for first and second prizes.
A Hew Pupil.
W. S. Williams, principal of the
Jackson school Is doing carpenter work
on the new church building. In. his
school work be tells his pupils to begin
at the bottom of the. ladder and climb
up step by step. In nailing on lin
ing he started in the same way, but
his boss told him to begin at the top
and come down board by board.
Williams is an obedient pupil and nodd
ed assent, but be can't for the life of
him understand the philosophy of the
proposition.
Adjudged Insane-
Mrs. Kate Bovenich, wife of Antone
Bovenich of Sutter Creek, was ad
judged insane Tuesday by Drs. Gall
and Endicott, and committed to the
Stockton Asylum. This is not the first
time the lady has been examined for
insanity. She fancies that some great
crime has been committed, and when
this idea takes possession of her mind
she seems possessed of superhuman
strength. The doctors have hopes
that her derangement will he of short
duration.

NOTES FROM
GOLD MINES
Gwin— Three hundred men are now ,
employed. A great deal of work has
been done on top, building, repairing,
etc. The 80-stamp mill is running con
tinuously. The mine is apparently do
ing its duty towards the stockholders
at the present time.
Marsino Gravel Mine— A new
formation has appeared in and around
the gravel. A cement lava carrying
free gold has been encountered which,
if it should continue, would necessitate
the erection of a small mill, and greatly
add to the output of the mine.
Fremont-Gover— The situation re
mains, the same as last week. The
sand flume is nearing completion. The
strike is still on, and the company
shows no disposition to yield.
The Kimball Properties—Kim
ball & Sons, of Defender, own four
claims in the Pioneer district, viz., the
Deadwood, Deadsheep, and south ex
tension to the Pioneer, all adjoining
claims, and one next to the Q. Mason
mine. On the Deadwood a small hoist
has been erected, and several tons of
good ore was taken out during the last
winter. 20 tons of rock was milled last
year that yielded $30 to the ton in free
gold. The shaft is 70 feet deep, and
the pay ledge is from 18 to 24 inches
wide. It is conceded to be the Defend
er vein. Six tons of $30 rock and 150
tons of $6 rock, are now on the dump,
and will be milled during the summer.
The shaft on the Deadwood is 200 feet
deep. Several years ago 75 tons from
this mine was crushed, and yielded $25
per ton in free gold. The sulphurets
are very rich, bringing the value up to
a much higher standard. This vein is
about 20 inches wide in the shaft.
In the Pioneer extension a 400 foot
tunnel has been run, and the prospects
are good. So confident are the owners
that these properties are good, that
they will bond them to any one who
will take hold of them and work them
properly. When men who own such
properties are willing to take chances
on results, those who have capital to
invest in mines should not hesitate to
open them up, with a view of purchas
ing in case they proved satisfactory.
Mother and Babe United.
A tender and touching funeral was
that of little Mary Frates. The re
mains of her mother, which had been
resting in Holy Cross cemetery in San
Francisco, were brought home so that
the flower of the family might rest upon
the bosom that had nursed her into ex
istence. And from love's shining circle
the gems drop away, and from the
midst the garden's beauties, the most
delicate and fragrant buds, do some
times but appear to enrapture and en
chant vs — and then fadeaway — to leave
the beholder sorrowful. So it was with
little sister, for Mary lone Frances
Frates was known to all her friends by
that tender appellation, "Sister." She
ma but reign long enough to enrich the
heart cords of loved ones and then de
part, leaving an untold vacancy that
never can be filled. "V-'.v
A quintet of October and the flowery
seasons have rolled away since little
Mary Frates was born to sweeten her
mother's last days upon earth, and
bless the ■declining' years of her father.
Nature had been lavish upon this child.
She bestowed her bounteous gifts, for
"Little Sister" was blessed with a
sweet, amiable disposition which graced
with an intellect that attracted the at
tention of all. These traits blended,
made a personality that won the ad
miration of strangers, and promised
ana! augured a grand woman. The
souls of father and mother communed
with their baby darling on earth. The
Almighty harkened to their yearnings,
and on the 27th of May, as old King
Sol was nearing the meridan, He beck
oned to her soul, and as gently and as
noiselessly as the sunlight departs from
the hills Sister's soul took , its onward
Bight to the great beyond, into the
outstretched arms of father and mother.
Harried.
Melvin W. Ford and Miss Henrietta
White were made husband and wife by
Rev. Father 'Horgan in the Catholic
church at 6:30 a. m. Wednesday morn

friends were present. After partaking
of an excellent wedding breakfast the
happy couple left amid a shower of
rice, for a ten days' stay in the state's
metropolis. Mr. Ford is one of Jack
son's enterprlstng and successful busi

. At the Kennedy east shaft two mules
have been lowered into the mine for
the purpose of hauling the ore through
the tunnels to the shaft. This is the

tried at the Kennedy, but as they have
proved advantageous in other mines
there is no reason why they should not
here. A suitable barn has been erected

for their comfort. We understand
they are to be brought to the surface

Italian Picnic.
Sunday's picnic was in many respects
the most successful held by the society
in many years. There have been larger
gatherings at times than were present
Sunday, but no more enthusiastic or
agreeable crowd ever met at Fullen's
grove. From early Sunday morning
until 2 a. m. Monday morning, the
merry voices and sweet strains of music
could be heard unceasingly. Each at
traction tended to add to the day's
pleasantness. The merry-go-round
was patronized by the babe In arms
and the gray-haired grandmothers
bowed down with age. The literary
exercises were not carried out as pro
grammed, owing to the failure of one
orator to be present. The disappoint
ment felt by the loss of one was more
than offset by the success of the other.
The address of Charles H. Crocker-fis
spoken of by all as a masterly effort.
Neatly dressed, with a clear and ring
ing voice, and perfectly self-possessed,
Mr. Crocker spoke as one who thor
oughly mastered his subject, bringing
great credit upon himself as well as
satisfying and honoring the committee
that selected him as speaker. The
baseball game was one of the afternoon
attractions. While not up to the
standard it was enjoyed by many.
West Point took the $50 and Jackson
the $25 purse.' The dance was better
patronized than ever. The Stockton
band was greatly appreciated, and the
musicians declared it to be one of the
best natured crowds that they had ever
played for. Not a disturbing element
appeared upon the grounds during the
day or evening. Socially it was a great
success. We cannot say how it result
ed financially until the committee
makes its final report.

Shade Trees.
The supervisors on Monday received
a communication from Amapola Par
lor, N. D. G. W., requesting them as
road commissioners to pay particular
attention to the preservation of shade
trees along the public highways; The
communication received favorable con
sideration. Every tree standing with
in the roadbed should be preserved. It
is a way-station where man and beast
can stop and become refreshed without
money and without price. To destroy
a tree in the public roads is a crime
punishable by a heavy fine.

Death of S. B. Bedliok.
S. B. Redlick, the treasurer of Red
lick Brothers, Incorporated, died at
Los Angeles Wednesday . evening,
after an illness of over four years. Mr.
Redlick suffered from tuberculosis,
which was aggravated by other com
plications that caused his death. He
spent several years in foreign travel in
a vain endeavor to regain his health.
He was one of the active members of
the corporation when in health, but of
late years devoted his whole time to
travel. Members of the family were
with him when the sad event occurred,
and accompanied the remains to San
Francisco, where the burial took place
Sunday. The Redlick stores were
closed Saturday out of respect to the
memory of the deceased.

Condition of Boads.
The county roads are now in fairly
good condition throughout the east
ern portion of the county. If the
supervisors have more money at their
disposal during the year, a portion of
it should be reserved for winter use.
When a particular spot becomes im
passable it should be fixed at once, and
at a time when a solid foundation can
be put in. To jeopardize life and prop
erty waiting for springtime to form a
crust upon which to sprinkle a little
gravel is sometimes hazardous, and a
roadbed repaired in this way is only
temporary.

Portußuene Characteristics.
The men of Portugal are as fond of
show as are the women. Their~fingers
are nearly always loaded with rings,
and about their bodies, which are
often as round as the bowls of their
tobacco pipes, hang chains as thick as
ropes, from which are suspended
bunches of trinkets.
The Portuguese dandy is very fond
of anything that will attract public
attention to his much esteemed per
son. Above his snowy vest he wears
a cravat of gleaming colors, while in
his buttonhole Is stuck a full blown
rose of inordinate size. I think I am
pretty safe in saying that most of the
promenadeis I have, seen strutting
about in the chieU^ thoroughfares on
Sunday with a riding whip In their
hands and handsome spurs on their
heels have never set foot in the stir
rup. The spur is to them a sign of
nobility which they arrogate to them
selves—a relic of the privileges of the
old chivalry.— London Standard.
Retailers of Fine Sandmt.
In the shop of n cabinetmaker in
New York a sign announces "sawdust
for sale." There is no evidence any
where of the bags of coarse pine saw
dust such as is used in butchers' shops,
markets and saloons.
"We don't handle that stuff," said
the proprietor of the shop. "Our spe
cialty is in the sawdust of fine woods,
such as mahogany, boxwood and san
dalwood. We sell sawdust by the
ounce or the pound, not by the bushel.
The sawdust of fine hard woods brings
good prices. There are about twelve
varietiesjof it, a nd _ each_has_ltß_apji
proprlate use.
. "Boxwood sawdust, the most expen
sive of all, is used by manufacturers
to burnish silver plate and jewelry.
Sandalwood is used for scent bags and
for the preservation of furs. There is
no waste of sawdust in our business."
—New York Press.
When Rubles Come From.
The rubj- mine 3Jn Burma are of four
kinds, the most valuable being gullies
formed by the action of water on the
side of the hills. Next to these come
the shafts, or tunnels, sunk in the hill
sides; and then the wells. These last
fire sunk in the valley, and are of two
sorts. The deep wells are sunk to
fifteen or twenty feet, and the shallow
ones only reach to four feet, whero
the first ruby bearing stratum is found.
Rubles, or rather red stones of all
sorts, are offered for sale in large num
bers and . at every conceivable price.
The inhabitants are well off, the min
ers being either Shans, in their enor
mous broad brimmed straw hats and
baggy trousers, or Chinamen, in indigo
blue.
Oar Debt to Asia.
It is noteworthy that out of Asia
came our alphabet and our Arabic nu
merals. The compass we owe to the
Chinese, who knew the magnetic nee
dle as early as the second century A.
D. Gunpowder originally came out of
Asia, and so did the art of printing and
the manufacture of paper. The Chi
nese invented movable types in the mid
dle of the eleventh century, 350 years
before Gutenberg. They also made
Bilks long before Europe and porcelain
that has never been equaled by Eu
rope. Truly, Asia is the cradle of the
race. On the original Ideas of the Per
sians, Arabians, the Hindoos and the
Chinese our modern society has been
built. — Portland Oregonian.

31 Queer Death Superstition.
A curious relic of the superstitious
ideas of the middle ages still exists in
many parts of England — the notion
that when the death of a person is im
minent the fastenings of the door of
the death chamber or of the other
rooms of tbe house hinder the depar
ture of the soul from the body, thus
making final dissolution doubly pain
ful.
A gentleman writing about half a
century ago for a collection of anti
quarian papers states that when be
was curator at Exeter be had a call
to the deathbed of one of his parish
loners. Upon arriving -there tbe wife
of the patient told the minister that
she had expected her husband to die
during the previous night and on thut
account had left the doors all open or
unlocked. Upon asking for reasons for
this odd proceeding he was told of the
neighborhood superstition.
Tbe Heart of Robert Drucc.
When Robert Bruce, king of Scot
land, lay upon his deathbed in the
year 1329 he remembered that he had
registered a vow to help wrest the
Holy Land from the heathen Turks.
It was clear that the time for fulfilling
this vow had passed, but a new thought
presented. Why not have his heart re
moved and sent to Jerusalem for
burial? To make the story short, this
was decided upon, and Sir James Doug
las was commissioned to carry it in a
sliver urn "to a place as near ns possi
ble to where the Saviour was cruci
fied" and there bury it. Arriving in
Spain, Sir James, with the precious
relic strung to his neck by a chain,
was killed In a battle with the Moors.
Sir Simeon Locard returned with the
heart to Scotland and deposited it un
der the altar of Melrose abbey, where
it now ia_

I consider Wine of Cardui superior E
to any doctor's medicine I ever vised I
and I know whereof I apeak. I euf- ■
fered for nine months with suppressed I
menatruation which completely pros- H
tratedme. Pains would shoot through H
my back and sidai and I would have E
blinding headaches. My limbs -would |
swell up and I would feel bo woak I ■
could not stand up. I naturally felt M
disconraged for I seemed to be beyond M
the help of phy«ician«, but Wine of 1
Cardui came as a God-send to me. I |3
felt » change for the better within a g|
week. After nineteen days treatment g|
I menstruated without Buffering the I
agoniea I usually did and soon became R
regular and without pain. Wine of H
Cardui ia simply wonderful and I wish B
that all suffering women knew of its X
good qualities. H

A horses In the state and his breeding Is of
the very best. Those who raise colts by this
beautiful young horse can consider themselves
fortunate. A tougher, more hardy, or better
formed horse never lived. His sire "Old Alta-
mont" was the greatest sire of extreme speed
in his day, having seven In the 8:10 list. There
are but two or three of his sons in the State,
and Paramount out-classes them all in beauty
and breeding. Paramount's dam, Nancy, by
