Testing the Lungs.
Draw in as much breath as you con
veniently can, then count as long as
possible, in a slow^nnd audible voice
without drawing In more breath. The
number of seconds must be carefully
noted. In a consumptive the time does
not exceed ten and Is frequently
less than six seconds; In pleurisy and
pneumonia it ranges from nine to four
seconds. When the lungs are sound
the time will range as high' as from
twenty to thirty-five seconds. To ex
pand the lungs go Into the air, stand
erect, throw back the head and shoul
ders and draw in the air through Ihe
nostrils a? much as possible.
After having then filled the lungs
raise your arms, still extended, and
suck in the air. When you have thus
forced the arms backward, with the
chest open, change the process by
which you draw m your breath, till
the lungs are emptied. Go through the
process several times a day, and It will
enlarge the chest, give the lungs bet
ter play and serve very much to ward
off consumption.
Microscopic Penmanship.
The subject of microscopic workman
ship really divides itself- into two
classes — penmanship and mechanical
construction. History has handed down
to us many examples of this form of
caligraphic mania, of which the chief
symptom Is a desire to compress the
greatest number of words into the
smallest possible space.
Pliny the Younger declares that Cicero
once saw the "Iliad" written so small
that it could be inclosed in a walnut
shell.. This affirmation was regarded
as improbable until the seventeenth
century, when Hue't, bishop of
Avranches, France, an excellent Greek
scholar, proved that it could be ac
complished.
The gospel of St. John and the Acts
of the Apostles were written within
the circumference of a farthing In the
sixth century by an Italian monk.
BURGLARIOUS STARS.
Planets and Sana May Pick lit Minor
Solar Bodies.
Jupiter is much the biggest member
of the family of stars which revolve
around our sun; consequently the pow
er of his attraction is greater than that
possessed, if or instance, by .the earth.
Jupiter's exploits as a burglar have
caused very considerable annoyance
and Inconvenience to astronomers in
the days before his" powers were fully
recognized. . .
In 1770 there appeared a fine comet.
Which was found to have an elliptical
orbit round the sun of so comparatively
small a size that Mr. Lexell, its discov
erer, calculated it would return in five
and a half years, but in 1775 telescopes
were vainly focused on the spot where
it was. expected to reappear, ami again
in 1781 It disappointed all observers.
Mr. Lexell plunged Into fresh calcula
tions and after much research found
that Jupiter was the culprit. The un
fortunate comet had been rash enough
to plunge Into the sphere of the giant
planet's attraction, with the result that
It tiad been completely diverted from
its former, orbit and flung off into quite
a different one of a twenty year period.
It has never been seen again by any
one on this earth and probably never
will be. " '
Jupiter was also responsible for the
delay which occurred in the return of
that splendid visitant known as Hal
ley's comet. Halley found that he was
not the first discoverer of this big com
et. - It had appeared at least twice pre
viously, once seventy-five years before
and again seventy-six years before that
The astronomer concluded that there
would be a further delay in its third
return and predicted that its next ap
pearance would be 518 days later. Ho
did notlive to see lt^ But in 1758, th^
year he had prophesied for its reap
pearance, astronomers were waiting
for it

EDUCATING OYSTERS.
Training; Schools In Which the Bi-
vulres Are Tn tight Some Sense.
"A school for oysters," said a dealer
In fish, "Is an Institution that you
would swear could not exist, for oys-.'
tera are notorious for their stupidity.
It is, however, a fact that there are
many oyster schools. I will ' explain
them to you In .such « way that you
will believe in them. An'oyster's intel
ligence is limited, but still It has intel
ligence. Years ago certain wise fish
dealers discovered t'uii ii you take an
oyster suddenly from its subaqueous
bed it opens its shell, whereupon the
life glving-water inside it all escapes
and the oyster dies. But if you ex
pose an oyster to the air ' gradually,
lifting it out of the water for a few
minutes and then returning it again, it
gradually learus that to keep its shell
closed when out of the water is the
best thing for Its health. These invest
tigators found that they could take tw«v
oysters,- one tr.tineil aud one untrained^'
and the trained oyster, keeping Its shell
closed while out of the water, would
live a long time, while the untrained
one, opening its shell, would die in a
few hours. Therefore training schools
for oysters were established. The
schools are In appearance nothing more
than reservoirs full of water. Oysters
are put in them, and the water is drain
ed off and then 'reiurned again. It Is
kept off for a few minutes at first, then
for ten- minutes, then for half an hour
and so on. Oysters in these schools
learn that they will live longest and
keep healthiest out of water If they
hold their shells tight shut. As soon as
they learn this they are graduated and
go, out into the world." — Philadelphia
Record.

Uniqne Way to Secure One's Pay.
Tattooing is still a favorite personal
decoration with some of the, natives of
Samoa, though not so fashionable there
as formerly. Those who practice the
art have an effective way of securing
their pny. The color extends from the
waist to the knees, no other part of the
body being marted. In the small of
the back the design shades off to a
point which is never finished by the
tattooer till his bill has been paid. As
the incomplete design is public evi
dence of tho wearer's indebtedness the
artist seldom has to wait long for his
money.
Friends and Relatives.
"So the poor fellow's dead?"
"Yes, and he left all his money to
charity. His funeral was very largely
attended."
"Ah, yes, he had lots of friends; I

SHOPS OF CANTON.
Brery Art and Industry Represented
In the Chinese City.
The merchants' alleys are the para
dise of the stranger who visits Canton,
China. The shops have open fronts on
either side the narrow lane, and every
art and industry, the homeliest trade
and the most fascinating pursuit,
thrives in the dark passage. .Black
swinging signboards proclaim the busi
ness in characters of red or gold. Pan
demonium triumphs in a series of yells
as the chairmen scream for pass room.
The poles hit the pedestrian in the eye,
and the mnndarin joggles the stranger.
The native tilts^his huge hat sidewise
to avoid a crush, and often the coolies
swing aslant in the alley or duck into
a store to avoid a catastrophe.
The Chinese as a people are modest
in their dress. The person Is rarely
exposed. 'Women wear double breast
ed sacks which fit tight to the, throat,
and men are usually covered./ But
"under the stress of hard labor the man
at -the forge is stripped to the waist,
and in the foundry a nearly nude
workman strides the iron seesaw like a
horse in the treadmill. The butcher
cleaves his flesher on the block amid
dried rats and skins of fowls stretched
taut on the rack. Next door the gold
beater hammers in his cave. Beyond
the kindling man piles high his forest
of fagots. Near by the miller is beat
ing the meal through coarse sieves.
Hla neighbor skins fish and hopes to
sell . them from the box where they
float under a feeble spurt of water. In
the adjoining den beautiful embroider
ies are piled mountain high, with silks,
satins and brocaded taffetas in won
drous designs of dragons and flowers.
Hau Cheung Tai patiently transfers
them by the hundred from shelf to ta
ble in the hope that some stray bit may
catch the buyer's fancy. Feathers are
an Important industry, and fans, fold-
Ing or open, line the next shop, painted
in every fanciful conception.— Detroit
Free Press.
The Art of Listening.
There is a grace of kind listening as
we'l as a grace of kind speaking. Some
men listen with an abstracted air
which shows that their thoughts are
elsewhere, or they seem to listen, but
by wide answers and irrelevant ques
tions show that they have been occu
pied with their own thoughts as being
more interesting, at least In their own
estimation, . than what yon have been
saying. Some interrupt and will not
hear you to the end. Some hear you to
the end, and forthwith begin to talk to
you about a similar experience which
has befallen themselves, making your
case only an illustration of their own.
Some, meaning to be kind, listen with
such a determined, lively, violent at
tention that you are at once made un
comfortable, and the charm of con
versation is at an end. Many persons
whose manners will stand the test of
speaking break down under the trial
of listening. •
Hasting" and Tilden.
Hugh Hastings, when editor of the
New York Commercial Advertiser, was
incessant in bitter attacks upon Samuel
J. Tilden. One day he received a let
ter from Flenry F. Spauldlng, then
president of the Central Trust com
pany, to the effect that his attacks
upon Mr. Tilden appeared unwarrant
ed, aud unless he could give some sat
isfactory explanation Mr. Spaulding
would discontinue taking the Commer
cial Advertiser. .
Mr. Hastings replied, "When I was
a clerk in Albany Sam -Tilden was
known as the boy who sold grated tur
nips) for horse radish, and he has been
doing It ever since."
; Mr. Spaulding did not stop the Com
mercial Advertiser.— New York Times.
A Way the Baby Has.
"Has the baby had the measles yet,
Mr. Popps?"
' "Sh-sh! Don't speak so loud. When
ever he hears anything mentioned that
he hasn't got he cries for it"
Ruskin's favorite adverb . was "en
tirely." Over the grave of his father
he put a memorial stone describing the
elder Rusktn as "an entirely honest
merchant."
fiii Bad
. ' "I suppose," said the condoling neigh
bor, "that you will erect a handsome
monument to your husband's mem
ory?"
"To his memory!" echoes the tearful
widow. "Why, poor John hadn't any.
I was sorting over some of the clothes
he left today and found the pockets
full of letters I had given him to mail."

THIS SALE IS GOING TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE, AS IT*IS g
the only sale we have had during 1903. Last April we contemplated to have
our regular Spring sale, but on account of the Jackson strike we had to give itg
up. Now we are going to take it all in and make up for lost time. It will thus be §
two sales in one. To make a success of this we have to sell an enormous quantity §
of-goods. Could we accomplish this without considerable reduction of prices? Of §
course not. We therefore earnestly appeal to ttie kindness of the readers to 'read:. g»
carefully the prices quoted in this advertisement, to make comparisons between for- 1 §

with our intentions, as we are determined to stand the raise. All we ask you is to §
not confound our sale with others. As to the sincerity of our statements, we believe J a
that the honesty with which we conducted our sales in the past, should be sufficient g

Monkey, and Parrot In Brazil.
In Brazil monkeys and parrots have
Interests in common. They not only
roost in the same trees, but work for
mutual benefit The monkeys cannot
easily pick the big Brazil nut husks
from the trees, so the parrots gnaw
them loose, allowing them to drop, the
tall to the ground splitting them. Then
the monkeys tear the cracked husks
asunder, gather the nuts and divide
them with the parrots. Sometimes,
when the husks fall to split, the mon
keys carry them up to the highest
limbs of the tree and let them drop
again. Monkey and parrot enjoy their
harvest side by side. — .

qualifications for fitness appealed to
the president's sympathy on the ground
that the candidate wns in poor health
and a residence in that climate would
be of great benefit to him. Lincoln
questioned the mr.n closely as to his
symptoms, then remarked:

"~ Is There an American Face f ~
The English face, the Jewish face,
the Irish face, the Italian face, the.
Chinese face, the Japanese face, the
French face, the Indian face, even the
negro face— all these have , something
about them which calls up a definite
picture in one's mind. But the Amer
ican face has no strong characteristic
to differentiate it from other faces of
superior races, remarks London Health.
It is international, for here and there
one may find the traces which suggest
a relation' to this, that or the other face.
It may be a line or a ligament be
queathed by an early English ancestry,
or something suggestive of Teutonlo
origin, or a sharp suggestion of the
Frenchman's face or the Irishman's, ox
the Italian's or the Scotchman's. Bui
when one must deal with the American
abstractly one can scarcely call up the
American face.
Uncle Bam', with his striped trousers,
his sharply cut coat, his plug hat, his
whiskers and his bland, good natured
countenance, Is a happy conception,
yet he may never hope to portray .the
matchless and indescribable cosmopoli
tanism of the American face.
Mnftl and Gold Lace.
Officers of the army on duty in the
war department v wear ' uniforms the
same as if they were on duty at mili
tary posts. The practice has resulted
in making nearly every room occupied
by officers a dressing room, where
wardrobes are kept. Most officers dis
like very much to appear on the street
in uniform; it makes them too con
spicuous. Uniforms for use in the.de
partment are kept in a wardrobe, and
the officers put them on when they
arrive in the morning, - take them off
and don civilian dress to go to lunch
eon, and upon their return in the
afternoon and departure for home
later go through the same process.
They don't like it, but it is an order.
For people doing business at the de
partment ■it is much better, for a
stranger knows whether he Is talking
with an officer or a clerk, and If fa
miliar with the emblems can tell the
rank of the officer.— Washington Post.

FRIDAY OCTOBER 9, 1903
AN IRRESOLUTE RESOLUTION.
The members of the board of
supervisors caaie together this week
under peculiar conditions. At their
last meeting they had resoluted on
the justice's salary case. At the re
quest of the attorney for the justices
and constables who are trying to
collect salaries under a law passed
during their term of office, in ap
parent conflict with the spirit and
letter of the 6tate constitution, they
gave notice to all parties concerned
that they would not allow any claims
against Amador county arising out
of the appeal of the salary case to
the supreme court. The district at
torney — the sworn counselor of all
county officials on all legal proposi
tions — was unceremoniously brushed
aside for the time being, and the ad
vice of the opposing counsel in a suit
instituted against Amador county
was taken, resulting in the passage
of the afore mentioned resolution of
intention to repudiate. The resolu
tion was 'born out of due time." Tt
was never intended for anything else
than a scarecrow. It has proved a
miserable failure in this respect. It
has scared no one. All of our co
temporaries greeted the passage of
this estoppel resolution with an
thems of approval. It was a master
piece of strategy, that promised to
unlock the doors of the county treas
ury to the salary grabbers without
further ado with the courts. Never
theless, the appeal side of the con
troversy went along as though
nothing had happened. In the pro
ceedings of the board published in
this issue it will be noted that three
claims relating to the appeal of the
justice's salary case were allowed.
One for typewriting amounting to
$30; another for printing the tran
script on appeal, amounting to $25;
the other for $10 for filing the tran
script in the supreme court. These
claims were plainly endorsed, showing
their connection with the case on ap
peal. This was done for the purpose
of guarding against any possibility
of their being allowed without know
ledge of their character. These bills
were passed for payment, and en
dorsed by the chairman without a
word of commen^. They were pass
ed upon by the district attorney as
legal claims against the county, and
not a murmur of protest was raised
against their payment. In thus act
ing the Ledger believes the super
visors did the right thing. It is
true, their act is sadly out»of unison
with the ill-judged resolution passed
at their previous meeting. But that
mistake they cannot now undo. And
they have done all tbat^hey are able
to do to rectify that blxmder by re
fusing to tread in the path they were
led to map out for themselves. We
presume our cotemporaries will now
with one accord proceed to laud this
latest exhibition as another notable
example ot doing the right thing at
the right time. They certainly ought
to be equally capable with the coun
ty managers in doing the change
about act.
THE INTOLERABLE TURK.
The insufferable Turk is the source
of more trouble and apprehension in
Europe than all other nations com
bined. More than 500 years have
elapsed since he first planted him
self upon the soil of Europe, and the
people to-day are not one whit more
reconciled to his presence than they
were at the beginning. Like the
Chinese in America, there is no pos
sibility of any assimilation of the
Turk to the ways of the western
nations. He belongs to the east and
not to the west. His oriental in
stincts and methods have clung to
him through the centuries of his
contact with western civilization.
He looks down upon other people
as Christian do^s, believes he be
longs to a superior type of mankind.
Assimiliation from his standpoint
means degradation — a step from the
higher to the lower plane. He fast
ened himself upon Europe as a con
queror. It is only natural that he
should look down upon the subju
gated people as his inferiors in
every way. The Turkish yoke has
never been otherwise than galling
and oppressive to Europeans. The
Turk is iudolent. To earn his living
by manual labor is not according to
his tastes or religion. His ambition
i>> to live in affluence at the expense
of others. An army of toll-gatherers
— legalized plunderers we might say
—is quartered upon the Christian
communities, and eat up the sub
stance of the inhabitants as com
pletely as a swarm of locusts re
duces a garden to a wilderness. As
a result, revolts against Turkish
domination are frequent. The desire
to throw off the yoke, and rid tb.s
country of his hateful presence is
ever paramount. The upshot of
almost every internal or external
imbroglio has been to wipe off a
goodly strip of territory from the
map of European Turkey. This pro
cess of attrition has earned for this
Musselman power the title of the
"sick man of* Europe." A fresh at
tack of sickness is now on in the in
surrections in Macedonia and Bul
garia. These subject provinces are
utterly unable to cope unaided with
the military forces of the Sultan.
They have the sympathy of the
Christian world behind them in their
struggle for freedom. ,The Turk
would have been driven from Europe
generations ago were it not for the
jealousies of the great powers as to
the parceling out of the territory
among the other nations. Even now.
shorn and contracted as compared
with the fullness of its power, the
dominions of the Turk embrace some
of the fairest and most fertile sec
tions of Europe. -They are compara
tive deserts now: they would bloom
like garden spots under favorable
conditions. Moreover, the most
commanding position from a com
mercial and naval" view-point is the
seat of Turkish authority on the
Bosphorus, Constantinople. Th»t
Turkey has maintained its foothold
in Europe so long is due to the dan
ger of upsetting the balance of pow
er in the distribution of these covet
ed points of vantage rather than to
any consideration for the -decaying
nation itself, It is evident, however,
that the issue must be met sooner
or later. The Turk is out of his
element where he now is. Western
civilization demands that he retire
to his native home in Asia, where
the people are less restive under his
.despotic ways. The finger of des
tiny seems to indicate th"at his re
tirement cannot be much longer de
layed. ■ ""•'•'■"' r-"-'".-';^
JOHN F. DAVIS CODE COMMIS
SIONER.
Judge John F. Davis, the well
known attorney of Jackson, was ap
pointed code commissioner by gov
ernor Pardee last Wednesday. The
contest for this office has been very
spirited. Senator Selvage of Hum
bold t was after the place. He was
a member of the last legislature, and
was instrumental in abolishing the
old code commission of. three per
sons, and passing the new bill pro
viding for one commissioner. It is
said be bad his eye on the berth from
the outset. If this be so, his loss of
the fight is a just rebuke to tho pol
icy of shaping legislation from mo
tives of self interest. The appoint
ment of Judge Davis will be greeted
with satisfaction by his host of
friends in this county. The appoint
ment carries a salary of $300 per
month, with $100 per month for
clerk and office expenses.
The Salve That Heals
without leaving a scar is DeWitt's.
The name Witch Hazel is appled to
many salves, but DeWitt's Witch Hazel
Salve is tbe only Witch Hazel Salve
made that contains the pure unadulter
ated witch hazel. If any other Witch
Hazel Salve is offered you it is a
counterfeit. ' E. C. DeWitt invented
Witch Hazel Salve and DeWitt's Witch
Hazel Salve is the best salve in- the
world for cuts, burns, bruises, tetter,
or blind, bleeding, itching and protrud
ing piles. Sold by City Pharmacy.

The Prehistoric Gold-find.
■■■ . - — ■ . - ■ r.
There's a sometime whispered atory^
'Mongst our Indians, seldom told
To the white man or his children.
Which concerns this land of gold.
Long ago, so runs the legend,
When Sequoia's groves were young,
Came a people strangely singing.
In a strange, unmeaning tongue.
Seeing on the Indian's armlet,
Nuggets bright of wondrous size.
Told they of their mighty chieftain.
Wisest man of all the wise.
Searched they on the snow-capped nmintain,
And the shining river sand;
Delved within the rock ribbed bosom,
Of the Indian's happy land.
Found they gold in such abundance.
That their backs bent 'neath its weight,
As they filed in long procession.
Toward the sunset's golden gate.
For King Solomon had sent them,
To his builder's gold to bring.
That his temple might be worthy.
Of his Lord, his God, his King.
Back they toiled o'er wastes of water
Never crossed by man' before.
Safe at last, they heaped their treasure,
On the Galileean shore. '
Wondering goldsmiths deftly wrought it,
In a veil most wondrous fair;
Hung it in that beauteous temple-
Solomon's far-famed house of prajer.
Even thus, at the crucifixion, V
California did her part.
For that golden veil was riven.
When they pierced our Savior's Heart.

Deafness is caused by an inflamed con

tachian Tube. When this tube is in
flamed you hare a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can bo
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hoaring will bo de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ton '
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.

How Taxes Bun Up.
As a sample of how taxes accumulate
on property that has been sold to the
state on account of delinquent taxes,
wo may mention that a property holder
this week appeared in Jackson for the
purpose of redeeming his holdings. He
was unaware of the status of the mat
tor until his attention was called to it
by tho publication in the Ledger. His
taxes for 1894 might have been settled
for something over $2. It cost him this
week, with penalties, interests and
other costs, over $20 to get the title
clear on tho records in his own name.
It is a great mistake for any property
holder to imagine that he can save
money by allowing. his property to be
sold and deeded to the state, under, the
impression that assessment of the prop
erty ceases after it passes to the state.
State property cannot be legally assess
ed; but the penalties and costs on de
linquent property are so gauged that
no matter when tho original holder re
deems, it will cost him more than if he
had paid his taxes regularly every
year as thej became duo. Some who
havo beeu inquiring about redeeming
delinquent property this week are
amazed at the doubling up process, and
are almost inclined to let the state keep
tho property rather than put. up the
sum necessary to redeem. And there
aro hundreds of pieces of property in
Amador county today, the title ' of
which has passed to tho state, and a
good deal of it is good property, and
worth many times over the price of
redemption. .37 •&

Jackson crock and Jackson Gato, but
who has booh in Tuolumno - county for
several years, is in trouble over some
illicit brandy distilling near Sonora. It
appears that some unstamped brandy
was discovered on land ownod by Don
dero, but which be had rented toother
parties. The sum of $750 was offorod
by the parties implicated to sottlo tho
matter. . The rovonuo officials refused
to settle for that sum. Later tho offer
was increased to $1500, and it is thought
this penalty will satisfy tho demands of
Uncle Sam.
As the resignation of Superintendent
J. B. Riddick of tho Preston school at
lone is in the bands of tho directors, to
take effect December 3, a number of
applicants are springing up for the
lucrative berth. It carries a salary of
$2500 per annum, with concomitant ad
vantages, such as household supplies
and free dwolllng. Tho candidates at
present prominontly mentioned for tho
position are Rev. August Drahms,
chaplain of San Quentin prison, E. Carl
Bank, who was the first superintendent
of the school, and whose regime was
unmarked by friction of any kind, and
E. H. Archer, who is at present sec
retary to the board of directors. Bank
is now superintendent of tho Bcnecia
Agricultural Works, Tho directors
meet in San Francisco to-morrow, am
it is likely that Riddick 'a successor will
be selected at that meeting.
The Wardenship of Folsora.
According to the San Francisco
papers, the selection of a new warden
for the Folsom penitentiary has been
virtually settled, and on November 10,
when tho board of prison directors
meet to name tho successor to Warden
Wilkerson, the honor will fall to J. M.
Standley, ex-sheriff of Mendocino coun
ty. In accordance with a time-honored
custom, the wisdom of which the Led
ger is unable to perceive, the wardens
of tho two state prison institutions are
selected from opposing political parties.
Presumably this is dono to remove
these positions out of the pale of politi
cal influence as much as possible. But
all the same this claim is merely a sham.
When a vacancy occurs, it is -the poli
ticians of both parties who bestir them
selves to get favorites appointed. More
over it is usually politicians — too often
of the back-number variety — who set
up a clamor for the fat berths. Re
publicans are found pulling the wires
for the appointment of a democrat, and
vice versa. Now, when a republican
administration is on top, why two good'
republicans — men who have been true
to the party in the ascendancy — cannot
be 'found to administer the affairs of
the prison, we have never been able to
find out. To try to divide the respon
sibility by selecting men of differing
political beliefs is not apt to prove a
success. It does not in fact remove the
institutions from political influence any
more than a straight-out policy. Cer
tainly if the past history -of the state
prisons is to be taken as a criterion, it
has accomplished nothing in the direc
tion of reform. But so the fiat has
gone forth that one state prisou must
be managed by a republican and the
other by a democrat. As. Warden
Tompkins of San Quentin is a republi
can, tho warde'nship of Folsom is due
to a democrat. When it became known
that Wilkerson had to retire, there
were a host of applicants for the place.
It may not be generally known that
U S Gregory, ■ ox-sheriff Of Amador
county, was mentioned for tho place.
Finally the race narrowsd down to a
contest between U S Gregory .of Ama
dor county, ex-sheriff J. M. Standloy
of Mendocino county, and"^. J; Fallon,
treasurer of Matin .county. . Gregory
was warmly championed by prison
director Dod Ray. and for -a time his
chances appeared promising. Then,
despite the support of director Ray, he
was eliminated from tho race, apd Fal
lon and Standley remained.
Each man was viewed, favorably by
the board of prison directors. Finally,
however, the experience gained by
Standley as an official in handling
criminals threw the balance to his side,
and a majority of the board now favors
his candidacy. \
To Apply for Pardon.
■ We have received a communication
from relatives of N. A. Macquarrle,
who is now confined in San Queotiu on
a conviction for forgery committed in
this county, saying that steps are being
taken to apply for a pardon. Mac
quarrie is a very sick man. He is suf
fering from chronic pleurisy. He has
submitted to three tappings already,
and it is very doubtful if ho recovers.
He is tho father of two bright childron
— a boy of eleven aud a girl of oight
years. It is thought hard that these
young lives should bo clouded with the
disgrace of having their father die in a
felon's cell. Relatives are exerting
themselves with the view of petitioning
governor Pardee for his pardon. It
will be remembered that Macquarrie
was convicted about 18 months ago of
issuing a spurious check and passing
the same upon a merchant in Jackson
for the sum of $50. He was sentenced
to seven years in San Quentin. Under
the circumstances the Ledger would
heartily support any effort to secure
his release, not only on account of hia
failing health, and for tho sake of his
children, but also "because there exists
a strong feeling that he has sufficiently
expiated the crime of which he was
convicted.
Funeral of V. Giovannoni.
Tho funeral of V. Giovannoni, the
proprietor of the Jackson macaroni
factory, whose sudden death occurred
on Friday morning of last week, took
place on Sunday afternoon. Deceased
has been a prominent resident of Aina
dor county from early times, and his
interment gathered a large number
from all parts of the county, all desir
ous of paying the final tribute of re
spect to tho memory of one whom they
had so long and favorably known. Ser
vices were conducted in the Catholic
church, the Rev. Father Gleason offici
ating. Under a mass of floral offerings,
many of them of exquisite design and
workmanship, and all the kindly and
affectionate contributions to tho mem
ory of departed worth, the mortal re
mains were laid to rest in the Catholic
cemetery.
Accident at Kennedy.
During tho lunch hour on Monday, a
costly accident occurred at the south
shaft of the Kennedy. Young Felmeth,
son of tho regular engineer, has been
running the engine for practice during
tho noon hour. Hearing the signal
bell, ho proceeded to answer and start
ed to hoist. In some way the en
gine got beyond control while he wa's
hoisting a skip partly filled with water,
and also containing a number of dinner
buckets belonging to tho minors. The
result was that the skip went into the
sump at lightning speed, carrying the
cable with it. Tho clutch was broken,
and other damage done. Fortunately
the cable caught at the 1300 level so
that fully one-half .of it will bo saved.
The loss is considerable, and will take
soveral days to repair. A corner in
dinner pails was created by this mis
fortune, one boarding house alono hav
ing lost ten in the mix-up. Fortunately,
no one was hurt by the disaster.

DRYTOWN.
Dkytown, Oct. 6.
On Sunday last a blue rock shoot
under the auspicos of the Dry town gun
club was held at their. trap grounds
near town. Numerous prizes were
awarded to the best marksmen; also a
booby prize was given to the poorest
shooter. In the first two contests
Sheriff Norman won first prizes, and
tied with W. Woym'outh for first prize
in tho third contest. Tho second and
third prizes wore about evenly divided
between Bona, Weymouth, Lee and
Grainger. The booby prize, consisting
of an ornamental loaf of bread, came
very near to falling into the hands of
Sir John of Plymouth, but in the third
contest it was snatched from his grasp
by Wm. Hodge, who broke but five
rocks out of twenty. The "Pet of Dry
town" and the ''Fashion plate of Sut
ter Creek" were doing some able coach
ing for Sir John, but it was not a suc
cess.
Every ono within half a mile "heard
of it" when Sir John's gatling gun was
fired, and Hodge who followed him in
each contest was badly handicapped on
account of the clouds of smoke from
the big gun.
Ed. Giannini's shells wore loaded so
heavily that he was kicked off the
track during the first contest.
The Drytown boys proved them
selves exports at live birds, because
thoy won every chicken that was put
up.
Charley Boro of New Chicago, who
made his first appearance before the
blue rock trap, won throo chickens in
the five contests which ho entered.
Practice up Charley, and some day wo
will back you against Norman. •
Alex Matulich would have won the
booby prize if he had entered the first
contest.
Smith & Cos. great moving picture
show played here last night to a crowd
ed house, crowded with empty benches.
Most of their audience was on the out
side, peeping through the broken win
dows. I gutss their apporatus was out
of order, for tho boys say the pictures

MINING NEWS OF
AMADOR COUNTY
The Defender a Good Producer.— To
Institute a Large Tailings Plant at
Sutter Creek— The Sand Pile. Mine.
Defender.— This mine in Pioneer
district continues to make a One record.
Tho mill is kept running steadily, the
output leaving a net profit of- from
$1500 to $2000 monthly to its owner.
Recently W. A. Clark, sen of Senator
Clark of Montana, was negotiating for
the purchase of the property, but the
negotiations fell through owing to some
misunderstanding iD regard to the time
of payment. From an inspection of the
mine the parties expressed themselves
as well satisfied with tlio prospects, and
there was no contention about the
price. It seems the intending .pur
chaser wanted the privilege of sinking
another 100 feet aud prospect the ledge
at that depth before being required to
make payment. F. B. Joyce, the
owner, who is not particularly anxious
to sell, concluded that this was un
reasonable, and the sale fell through.
Horn. — Geo. W. Horn, tho superin
tendent of this property, was in Jack
son Saturday,' on his way to San Fran
cisco to attend the annual meeting of
the company, which takes ■ place in a
few days. It is expected that arrange
ments will be made at the meeting of
stockholders to resume work at the
mine. Nothing has been done for two
or throemonths. owing to lack of funds.
Mr. Horn is a caivful manager, and
adopts the wise policy of not attempt
ing to do any work unless he has the
money in sight to pay the employes.
He expects that by extending the . tun
nol another 100 feet at furthest, the ore
body disclosed by tho shaft above will
be reached.
New Method of Working /Tail
ings. — E. J. Harrah and H. H. Harrah
of Oakland, of tho firm of E. H. Har
rah & Co., have been in Suttor Creek,
Amador county, this week, making ar
rangements for the working of a large
body of tailings on the dump at the
chlorine plant. They have purchased
the 25,000 tons as well as tanks for the
working, and will commence operations
very soon, somewhat on the principle
of cyaniding, although entirely a new
process of their own. The Messrs.
Harrah are at present engaged in plac
ing the large tanks and putting in nec
essary machinery. Previous attempts
have been made to work these tailings,
but each was a failure. — Call.
Sand Pile Mine.— The big cyanide
plant for the treatment of the immense
accumulation of sand and tailings at
this property, near Forest Home, in
this county, is nearing completion.
This plant is the first attempt on a
large scale to introduce tho cyanide
system in the extraction of gold from
slimes and fine sulphurets, the es
capes in this case from the Plymouth
mills, into this county. The outcome
of the venture is awaited with consider
able interest. It is said that before
the present extensive plant was start
ed, a practical test on a small scale was
made, with satisfactory results. Tho
plant now nearing completion is ex
pected to start up ;-.boui the middle of
this month. It consists of six large
vats, each of the capacity of 240 tons.
The auriferous' bearing sand will be
subject to the action of the- dissolving
fluid for several days, but tho output is
calculated at 240 tons per day. The
works have been constructed at a cost
of between $30,000 and $40,000. The
contract for the delivery of 240 tons of
sand, to the cars has been awarded to a
Plymouth man at 10 cents per ton — or
$24 per day. It is estimated that the
accumulation of sand to be treated is in
the neighborhood of three million tons,
sufficient to keep the works running to
their full capacity for twenty years.
From careful assays, the tailings are
said to carry at least one dollar per ton
in gold. If 40 per pent of this' value
can be saved, there is a good margin of
profit in the enterprise. When in full
running order the plant will give em
ployment to about 20 men.
An Evening of Humor and Fun.
Next Monday evening Cyrus Brown
lee Newton, the noted humorist and
comedian, will give one of his pleasing
entertainments in the' M. E. church,
Jackson. He is tho prince of entertain
ers in his line. He has appeared before
Stockton audiences over 30 times, and
Sacramento and other cities over 20
times, always commanding a crowded
house. He is a nativo of California,
and by far the most noted humorist
the state has produced. Last winter a
.series of three entertainmonts was ar
ranged to be given in Jackson, and
tickets for the course were sold by Miss
HildA Clough. Two entertainments
were given at that time. Those hold
ing these season tickets will be admit
ted to this entertainment on presenta
tion of the same at ' the doors. For
others the admission will be 50c for
adults; 25c for children. Proceeds
over expenses will bo given to ' the M.
E. church.. This is an opportunity
that should not bo missed to onjoy an
intellectual and comical feast.
The Case of Stamps.
James Stamps, who was so severely
burned at Elcctra two weeks ago by
coming in contact with a livo wire, is
getting along nicely at the hospital in
San Francisco. As conflicting reports
have boon circulated as to the .outcome
of his injuries, on inquiring at Eloctra
we have been informed that tho injured
arm had not been amputated up to tho
early part of this week. The attend
ing surgeon was in hopes of saving the
entire arm.
This morning welearnod froinElectra
that the arm had been amputated at
a point just above the elbow. The in
formation was sent up by one of the
linemen who had been to visit him,
and there is no doubt as to tho correct
ness.

A Novel Proceeding.
.A curious incident that does not ap
pear in the official minutes of the super
visors, occurred last Monday. The
bills for expenses incurred in the appeal
of the justice's salary case were all al
lowed, and signed by the chairman in
open session. But after the board, had
adjourned, it seems that the matter
was the subject of . discussion in the
clork's office, as though these claims
were approved without knowing their
import. The upshot was that one of
the bills— the claim for printing the
transcript— was marked by a load pen
cil being drawn over the indorsement
of approval.- Whether this was in
tended to withdraw the approval of
the claim we do not know. It cortaln
ly did not have that effect. The act of
approving a claim can only be rescinded
by the action of the board in official
session. However, the pencil mark
had the offect of causing tho treasurer
to withhold payment until the matter
was explained. The claim was paid on
Wednesday, the pencil score notwith
standing.
Card of Thanks.
To all kind friends who rendered
their assistance and aid during the last
illness and funeral ceremonies of Stefano
Lavezzo, the sincere thanks of his sor
rowing relati ves are hereby tendered.

The charge against the two China
men for cleaning up the Golden Gate
mill was dismissed by the justice court
of Volcano on Tuesday. The men were
in the calaboose for a week. C. H.
Crooker went up to look after the de
fendants' side, when the cases were
thrown out without a hearing.
Max Ladar was the happiest man in
town last Srfnday. That morning his
wife presented with an eleven-pound
boy. Not that births in the Ladar
household have been a rarity in the
past. Ho had been blessed with six
births before; but they were all girls.

Drawing Their Fees.
The hollowness of the contention
made by the justices and constables,
that they could not, owing to the
attitude of the auditor, draw any com
pensation for their services in criminal
cases, either under the old or the new
law, until the' final determination of
the suit now pending by the supreme
court, is fully, 'shown- by a perusal of
the proceedings of the board of super
visors published in this issue. It will
be seen that some justices and con
stables were allowed their fees. No
doubt all would have been allowed their
just claims under the fee law had they
sent in their claims. • It is noticeable
that those who have been the loudest
in denouncing the appeal of the case;
are not in the list. of bills allowed.
Neither are those who. figure as peti
tioners in the /mandamus proceedings.
It would, seem incongruous
for them as individuals to put in a de
mand for fees while they are actually
suing for salary. Viewed in the light
of a friendly suit for the purpose of
testing the constitutionality of the sal
ary law, we can see' nothing inconsist
ent in accepting fees, pending the final
outcome. It may be, after the hue and
cry that ' has been made, after the
strenuous efforts that have been made
to block the appeal proceedings, a re
treat at this juncture would appear
strange. At any rate, the plea that
they were asked to serve without pay
has been exploded by the unanswer
able logic of facts.

THE LARGER FOOT.
Bee If This Shoe Salesman* Theory
Fits Yonr Case.
"The question of which foot to fit
first is an important one to us," said th«
"shoe salesman. "It may seem strange to
you, but it is rarely that we do not ex
perience some trouble In fitting one
foot while the other is easily covered.
A popular belieStobtains that the left
foot of every person is the hardest to
fit, ;.nd consequently many shoe clerks
always try a shoe on that foot first. It
Is not true, however, according to my
observation, that there is any inflexible
rule as to which foot to try first. It ia
true, nevertheless, that In a majority
of cases if you succeed in fitting the left
foot you will have no trouble with tho
right. My practice is to try both feet
before I pronounce a pair of shoes a
perfect fit. Then lam sure of avoiding
any mistake growing out of peculiar
ities of foot formation. No two per
sons have feet formed exactly alike,
and the shoe salesman who thinks so
anil is governed accordingly will meet
with many complaints.
"For some time I pondered over the
problem of fitting shoes to feet, and es
pecially as to why the left foot should
be considered tjje standard by which
to be governed. . The only rational the
ory I have ever been able to evolve is
a very simple one when you come to
consider lt-_ Nine out of ten persons
you meet are tight handed, as we say.
About one person In ten, or perhaps the
per cent is even less than that, uses his
left hand. If you will observe persons
w.ho use the right hand when they are
standing and talking they Invariably
rest their weight on the left foot. And,
vice versa, a left handed person will
rest his or her weight on the right foot.
The result is that" with right handed
persons the left foot is probably a frac
tion larger than the right foot, and the
shoe clerk must inevitably- find this to
be a fact sooner or later." — New Or
leans Times-Democrat.
ROMANCE IN VARIED QUISE.
Definition of the Word Is Susceptible
of Wide Diversification.
What Is romance? Even the collo
quial use of the term is varied. When
we say "you are romancing" or call
anything romantic as distinguished
from what Is real or what is true we
mean one thing, but quite another
when we apply the term romantic to
natural scenery. And ln this applica
tion we must distinguish between the
effect upon us of that which we call
romantic because of human associa
tions with certain sights or sounds and
that wlldness of nature which we call
romantic because of its absolute dis
sociation from anything human.
Keeping out of mind the use of the
word ln artistic and literary criticism,
let us try to find what element of
reconcilement there is in the diversities
of colloquial usage.
In all that Is generally called ro
mantic ln the cases above mentioned
there Is the common element of
strangeness. We easily revert to what
must have been the original - sense of
the word in its connection with those
mediaeval modifications of the Latin
tongue known as the romance lan
guages. The Saxon or Celt would
have found his native tongue sufficient
for all ordinary needs, but If he
caught the Roman air ln any way, by
travel or refinement of taste and habit,
he would, to meet the. newly developed
need, borrow the graces of the Roman
speech — that Is, he would romance. —

Rockefeller and the Bang*."
In former years John D. Rockefel
ler's supervision of Standard Oil com
pany affairs took in even the smallest
detail. On gne occasion, according to
Ida M. Tarbell In McGlure's, com
menting on a monthly statement, he
called a refiner's attention to a dis
crepancy In regard to bungs, articles
worth about as much ln a refinery as
pins are ln a household. "Last month,"
he said to the subordinate official con
cerned, "you reported on hand 1,119
bungs. Ten thousand were sent you
at the. beginning of this month. You
have used 0,627 this month. You re
port 1,012 on hand. What has become
of the other 580?" Apparently Mr.
Rockefeller's idea was: Take care of
the bungs and the barrels will take
care of themselves.
The Mistress' Character.
The London Globe prints a "char
acter" which an English servant leav
ing kindly gave her mistress: "In an
eer to your letter, It's not a bad place;
the Mrs. understands her dntys,~*nd Is
slvel and obliging, but troubles about
getting up early ln ths mornings. There
la plenty, and If you don't mind a place
where only one other young . lady Is
kept besides yourself, you might give
them a month's trial. I like more so
ciety, which Is why "I am leaving."
His Narrow Logic.
"If I had my way," said the man of
high principles, "there would be no
money in politics.'*
"But, 1 * said Senator Sorghum, "If you
didn't put ftHy money In politics it
isn't likely you could have your way."

EMERSON'S PROSE-STYLE.
Held to Be Lacking In the Quality
of Writers Called Masters.
What shall be said of Emerson's
prose? Was Matthew Arnold right
when, as an experienced critic calmly
judging the favorite author of - hla
youth, he denied that the "Essays,"
the lectures and "English Traits" form
ed a body of prose of sufficient merit
to entitle Emerson to be ranked as a
great man of letters? It seems as if
the time had come for Emerson's coun
trymen frankly to accept this verdict
Because of deficiencies, both of style
and of romance, Emerson* does not
belong to the small class of the great
mnsters of prose. His style, despite
the fact that "Nature" and many of
the essays contain pages of eloquent
prose almost equal in power and bean
ty to noble poetry waj pearly always
that of the lecturer or pfeacliSf ratter
than that of the writer. He too fre
quently lost the note of distinction and
was content if he satisfied his far from
exigent audiences. In diction, to be
sure, he was a conscious' and consum
mate" master, and it need scarcely be
said that few writers have surpassed
him in the ability to compose a preg
nant sentence. But, as is generally ad
mitted and as is shown by his prac
tice of piecing his notes together, he
was rarely able to evolve a paragraph,
much more a whole essay, in a mas
terly or even ln a workmanlike fashion.
It may be granted that critics have
overemphasized his lack of coherence,
that there Is more logical unity in his
essays than appears on first reading,
that "English Traits" and the later
volumes are far from being mere
strings of "orphlc sayings," but the
fact seems to remain that the prose
style of Emerson from ..first to last
lacks the firmness, the compass, the
precision, the flexibility, tlfe individ
uality we demand of the prose writers
whom we denominate masters. — Pro
fessor Trent in Bookman.
MIGHTY TREES OF SIERRA.
Greatest In Sice of All Creations of
tbe Living: World.
During all the ages nature has fa
vored the growth of forests on the Pa
ciflc mountains, providing the peculiar
conditions which make them far differ
ent from, greater in size, more luxuri
ant, than any other ln the world. Of
nil the ; creations of the living world
none is so great ln size, so majestic ln
presence, as the mighty trees of the
Sierra nnd-the Cascades. For here the
air is always fertile with moisture,
clouds blown in from the Pacific ocean
rest among the mountain summits, even
crowning thq tops of the trees them
selves, and here discharge their rain.
The soil is deep and spongy with cen
turies of decomposing vegetable matter,
furnishing an unequaled nurturing
place for vegetation, and there are no
extremes of heat ln summer or depths
of cold in winter, says the Century
Magazine.
Every condition has been favorable
to unexampled exuberarice of growth
not only or the largest trees, but of all
manner of undergrowth, vine, shrub
and brake. A, huge tree falls, decays
and is yellowed with thick moss. Im
mediately, scores of young firs and ce

first chnuco of a bare spot ln the wood.

Placing Him Right.
-As a northern express drew up at a
station in the early morning for a few
minutes' wait, a pleasant looking gen

"Isn't this invigorating?"
"No, sir; It Is Normanton," said the
conscientious employee.

"We are here today," sold the solemn

"That's right," agreed the dyspeptic

gar, "and when we get back six months
later some of our best friends want to
know where we've been for the last

A Stamp Wasted.

GUARDIAN CRANES.
They Take the Place of Shepberd
Dogs In Venezuela.
The natives of Venezuela and ad
joining countries on the north side of
the river Amazon often avail them
selves of the services of a native crane
to care for their poultry and also, in.
the place of collies or shepherd dogs, to
guard and herd their domestic animals.
This remarkable bird, which the In
dians call yakamik, and the ornitholo
gists Psophia crepitans, is found in a
wild state In the great forests which
He between the northern coasts of
South America and the Amazon river,
particularly in Venezuela and British
Guiana. The birds never leave the for
ests unless shot or captured. They may
be trusted with .the care of a flock of
sheep or domestic fowls and every
morning will drive the ducks and poul
try to their feeding places and, care
fully collecting any stragglers, bring
them safely home at night A yakamik
soon learns to know and obey the voice
of Its master, follows him, when per
mitted, wherever he goes and appears
delighted at receiving his caresses.
It pines at his absence and welcomes
his return and is extremely jealous of
any rival. Should any dog or cat ap
proach it files at It with the utmost
fury and,, attacking It with wing and
beak, drives it^away. It presents itself
regularly during meals, from which it
chases all domestic animals and even
the negroes who wait on the table if it
Is not well acquainted with them, and
only asks for a share of the eatables
after it has driven away all who might
aspire to a favorable notice from the
family.— Brooklyn Eagle.
A Long Dance.
William Kemp, an English comic ac
tor who flourished during the last years
of Queen Elizabeth and who belonged
to the same company as Shakespeare
and "created" Dogberry, danced from
London to ' Norwich, a distance of 114
miles. He was accompanied by a serv
ant, an umpire and a man with a tabor
and pipe. Crowds hindered his start
on Feb. 11, 1600, and many met him at
every place. Several tried to dance
with him, but none could rival his pace.
The most successful were w,omen. ' Al
though! delayed by a snowstorm, he did
itjn nine days, and on the way accept
ed "a challenge or two, each time com
ing off best, except when a Chelmsford
maiden of fourteen danced till he was
'ready to He down." On his return he.
wrote an account of it, which ends
with a warning to those with whom he
had made wagers that if they did not
pay up he would publish .then- names.
The "Nine Dales' Wonder," as the title
runs, is a merry, readable pamphlet.
Among other curious information in it
is the statement that the customary
way to deal with pickpockets at the
theater ln those days wns to tie them
No Language of Their Own.' ~
Among the peoples of the world the
Swiss are alone in having no language
they "can call their own. According to
a recent visitor to the little country,
about three-fourths of the people of
Switzerland speak German, while the
remainder divide four other languages
among them, mainly French and Ital
ian, the languages varying as a rule
according to the proximity of the'peo
ple to each country whose tongue they
speak/ Public documents and notices
are printed in both French and Ger
man.
In the Swiss congress, or national
parliament, the members make their
speeches either ln"Frencn''or German,
for nearly all the members understand
both languages. The orders of the pres
ident are translated by an official in
terpreter and fnrnisbed to thejnewspa
pers ln both languages. . . '
Curioattlea of Color.
After any severe shock you will be
very likely to find that you have bo
come temporarily color blind.
Your perception of green light has
probably gone, at least partially. White
objects will then appear, to you of a
reddish purple and green objects to be
very much duller ln hue than ordi
narily.
Any one can make himself or herself
temporarily color blind by wearing a
pair of ruby red glasses. The prolonged
action of red light on the eyes ends by
tiring out the nerves which receive red
light. Consequently when the glasses
are at last removed a rainbow appears
to have only two colors— yellow and
blue. /-■■..-" r-

Tbe Dinner Hoar.
It is a curious fact that with almost
every generation the dinner hour has
undergone a change, the principal meal
of the day being eaten at different pe
riods, from 10 o'clock in the morning
until 10 o'clock at night. The author
of "The Pleasures of the Table' 1 points
that ln England 400 or 500 years
'ago people took four meals— breakfast
at 7, dinner at 10, supper at 4 and liv
ery at 8. In France 1» the thirteenth
century 0 In the morning wo* the din
ner hour; Henry Vfl. dined at 11. In
Cromwell's time 1 o'clock had come to
be the fashionable hour and In Addl
son's day 2. o'clock, which gradually
was transformed into 4. Pope found
fault with Lady- Suffolk for dining so
late as 4. Four and 5 continued to be the
popular, dining hours among the aris
tocracy until the second decade of the
nineteenth century, when dinner was
further postponed, from which period
it has steadily continued to encroach
upon the evening.
Her Little Joke.
They were in the studio. Artists'
trappery and bohemlan paraphernalia
were placed about the room with
studied carelessness. .1
Heavy tapestries and portieres choked
the walls." Costly statuary, medireval
firearms, poniards, yataghans -"and
priceless and historic armor were
ranged idly about tho room. • v
Seated on . a heavily upholstered
divan, eying the American heiress at
work on an intricate landscape, was
the duke.
"Bah Jove!" he ejaculated suddenly.
"Do you know, Miss Millyins, I'm
wrapped up ln you and" —
"Huh!" Interrupted the wealthy
maiden.with Yankee sarcasm. "I don't
see why"you should be wrapped up.
I haven't bought you yet."
The duke sat dumfounded, wonder
ing what there was in her remark to
cause a smile to break out over her
sweet visage.— New York Times.
Control Your Thoughts.
In the firm control of our thoughts
lies "the secret of the most wonderful
