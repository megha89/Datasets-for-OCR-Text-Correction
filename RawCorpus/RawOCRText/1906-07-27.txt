Woman's Trials.
The bitter trail in a woman's life Is to
be childless. Who can tell how hard the
struggle may have been ere she learnt to
resign herself to her lonely lot ? The ab-
sence of this link to bind marital life
together, the absence of this one pledge
to mutual affection is a common disap-
pointment. Many unfortunate couples
become estranged thereby. Even if they
do not drift apart, one may read the whole
extent of their disappointment in the eyes
of such a childless couple when they rest
pn the children of others. To them the
largest family does not seem too numerous
In many cases of barrenness or child-
lessness the obstacle to child-bearing is
easily removed by the cure of weakness on
the part of the woman. Dr. Pierces Fa-
vorite Prescription has been tho means of
restoring health and fruitfulness to many
a barren woman, to tho great joy of the
household. In other, but rare cases, the
obstruction to the bearing of children has
been found to be of a surgical character,
but easily removable by painless operative
treatment at the Invalids' Ilctel and Sur-
Seal Institute. Buffalo, N. V., over which
r. Pierce of the "Favorite Prescription"
fame presides. In all cases whero chil-
dren are desired and are absent, an effort
should be made to find out the real cause
since it is generally so easily removed by
proper treatment.
In all the various weaknesses, displace-
ments, prolapsus, inflammation and de-
bilitating, catarrhal drains and in all
cases of nervousness and debility, Dr
Pierces Favorite Prescription is tho most
efficient remedy that can possibly be used.
It has to its credit hundreds of thousands
of cures — more in fact than any other
remedy put up for sale through druggists,
especially for woman's use. The ingredi-
ents of which the "Favorite Prescription "
is composed have received the most
positive endorsement from the leading
medical writers on Matcria Medica of all
the several schools of practice. All the
ingredients are printed in jjlaln EmjlLih
on the wrapper enclosing the bottle, so
that any woman making .use of this
lamous medicine may know exactly what
she is taking. Dr Pierce takes his pa-
tients into his full confidence, which he
can afford to do as the formula after
which the "Favorite Prescription" is
made will bear the most careful exam-
ination.
Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets are the
best and safest laxative for women.

Acoutic or Chladin figures, pro
duced in sand by the vibrations of a
plate or membrane, are usually highly
symmetrical, but vary greatly with
the shape of the plate, the way it is
supported and set vibrating, and
with other conditions. In showing
the possibilities of this curious kind
of picture-making at a late soiree ot
the Condon Koyal Society, Joseph
Uoold strewed a little magnesia on a
steel plate several feet long by three
inches wide and % inch thick, sup
ported on four rubber points near the
ends. The symmetry of the figures
produced was modified or destroyed
at will by changing the place of small
clamps. On exciting one of two
closely tuned sets of vibrations, the
other became active, and quite extra
ordinary fluctuations resulted. The
nodal line extending lengthwise along
the plate opened out into two lines,
surging to and fro. The magnesia in
each line performed extraurdinary
gyrations resembling the motions of
smoke clouds, the two nodal lines
across the ends separated into
peculiar spirals, and there were other
strange ellects.
A singular spring lately discovered
in New Mexico discharges a saturated
solution of sodium sulphate at a
temperature of 110 degrees F. The
weight ot the liquid is 10 2-3 pounds
per gallon, that of distilled water
being only 8 1-3 pounds. The over
flow from the spring has solidified
into a perfectly level, snow-white
bed of sodium salts, miles in extent.
A street car equipped with roller
bearings, first adjusted and graphited,
has been run in Hanover without
further attention for six months. The
bearings have shown no perceptible
wear, and tests indicate an economy
in power of 23 per cent, while the
actual saving includes the usual cost
of oiling and attendance.
The new chemistry of cold has
placed in our workshops a series of
liquid substances that have been
known hitherto only in gaseous
forms. Investigating nitrogen, 11.
Erdmann finds that when passed from
a cylinder through a cooling worm
into a cylindrical copper vessel cool
ed in liquid air, this gas can be
liquefied in large quantities at any
pressure between 0.7 and 2.5 atmos
pheres, and then, on filtering, is a
perfectly colorless mobile liquid.
Not only ice but absolute alcohol
sinks in this liquid, confirming the
estimate placing its density at 0.7914.
Having a lower temperature, liquid
nitrogen is a more efficient cooling
agent than liquid air. It is a good
solvent for liquids of low boiling
point, and mixes in all proportions
with liquid oxygen or liquid ozone.
It is inert toward most substances,
and even metals like calcium and
magnesium, do not readily combine
with it, but a mixture of calcium
drillings and liquid nitrogen is
ignited by thermite and continues
to burn a long time, forming calcium
nitride.
From the records of 25 years, F . J.
Brodie has found that July is the
month of the largest number ot
tbunderstroms over Great Britain as
a whole. For the whole year the
largest number is over the eastern
and northern parts of Enlgand, where
mure than 75 occur, while there are
less than five in the west and south
of Ireland, and at most places in the
north of Scotland. The summer
distribution is very similar to that
for the year. The winter distri
bution is quite different, however,
and the largest numbers then occur
along the west coast ot Ireland and
Scotland and the extreme southwest
of England.
Seasickness is proven by Dr. Charles
Davison to be a common effect ot
earthquakes. The feeling of nausea
may be produced by shocks lasting
not more than eight or ten second
and whose vibrations have a total
range of only a small fraction of an
inch, and in one slight English earth
quake, to small to injure any build
ings -about one observer in fifty was
affected. The feeling usually lasts
a few minutes, though sometimes per
sisting an hour or more.
A solution of the problem of coat
ing leather with rubber is claimed by
Joseph J. Steinharter of Philadelphia.
In his newly patented process the
leather passes under a wire brush that
raises a nap on the surface, and is
then fed between two rolls, one at a
temperature of 100 degrees F., and
the other at 300 degrees, a reoeptacle
filled with thin unvulcanized rubber
being placed above the bite of these
rolls, with a funnel-shaped nozzle to
convey the material to the face of the
leather and distribute it evenly over
the surface.
A third roll, at 300 degrees, draws
rubber in a thin film from a plastic
mass beneath, pressing it upon the
already thinly coated leather. Hie
first coating acts as a cement to which
the film firmly bdheres and tbe layer
thus formed is afterward vulcanized.
The vulcauized rubber layer is
practically indetacbable being held
by the fibers of the nap imbedded in
it.
Medical treatment almost wholly
confined to the day time is thought
by l)i. .Lander, a trench physlaian,
to be a serious mistake. Disease is
most active at night — asthma, epilepsy
and other attacks coming then almost
entirely, — and observations have
shown that medicine administored in
the night hours, or both night and
day. acts better and with greater
effect than an equal dose all given
in the daytime. It is explained that
in the nocturnal fasting state the
body absorbs remedies with greater
energy, while they are eliminated
less quickly. In many instances
disease has resisted all medication by
day, but has yielded to night treat
ment.
The entire stomach was first success
fully removed by Sohlater of Zurich
in 1897, B. Vassallo, a surgeon of
Argentina, reports having now per
formed 17 pylorectomies, and con
siders the gravity of these operations
more apparont than real. Four
months after the last complete re
moval of this organ, the patient was
in excellent health, with no incon
venience except the necessity of eat
ing often and but little at a time.
A sweet breath adds to the joy ot a
kiss. You wouldn't want to kiss our
wife, mother or sweetheart with a bad
breath. You can't have a sweet breath
wtbout a healthy stomach. You can't
have a -healthy stomach wthout per
fect digestion. There is only one
remedy that digest what you eat and
makes the breath as sweet as a rose
— aud that remedy is Kodol tor dys
pepsia. It is a relief tor sonr stom
ach, palpitation of tbe heart, and
other ailments arising from disorder
of the stomach and digestion. Take
a little Kodol after your meals and
see what it will do for you. Sold by

State Support of Orphans.
A. J. PUlsbury, secretary -of the
state board of examiners, was in
Jackson Monday His visit here was
not to do politcs, but to look into
matters concerning tho orphans and
half orphans, who are a charge upon
the state treasury. He intorms us that
there are 5,000 orphans in public and
private institutions tbat are either
wholly or in part supported from the
state treasury. Besides tnese there
are 2,000 orphans and halt orphans
who are supported partly by the
various oounties, which are reimburs
ed for all moneys so paid out of the
state treasury. Tbe aggregate Bum
paid for these orphans is immense,
and requires a tax of between three
and four cents on each 8100 of taxable
property in the state. And yet the
counties have not all lined up at the
state treasury to demand their quota
tor tbe support of sucn children.
Some ten of the largest cuunties in
the state (including San Francisco)
have put in no claim on this score so
far. But they will all wake up to the
issue ere long, and when tbe roll call
of the counties is complete on this
proposition, it is safe to say tbat the
death knell of the law as it now
stands will be sounded. The state
treasury could not stand such a drain
— or rather tbe people generally
would notstaudfor it. It would break
down of its own weakness, and tbe
more lational plan of compelling each
county to look after its own orphans
be substituted in its place. The
Ledger is nut arguing against the
proposition of extending aid to
orphan children from the public
treasury We believe in the wisdom
of such a course. But we do contend
that it should be tbe business of each
county to look after this matter; that
upon the taxpayers of each county
tbe burden should fall exclusively.
In tbat event, each application for
aid would be examined and passed
upon strictly on its merits. The
looseness that now prevails, born of
tbe fact that the money comes from
the state and not tbe county treasury
—would be done away with.
Prof. Jordan has branched out into
the prediction business, and has given
bis opinion that the next serious
earthquake will likely iind its focal
centre about Hayward3. If such cal
amity talk came from a less distin
guished man it would be denounced
and ridiculed as was the venture of
Mrs Buddjn the same line recently.
It comes with with poor taste for a
scholar and a scientist to indulge in
scare talk. He fixed no date, so he
cannot be called down for non-fulfil
ment.
We have been requested to voice
our opinion concerning a matter of
general interest to the people; name-
Jy the practioe of closing public
offices, schools, etc., on account of
funerals of private citizens. We have
bad-instances of schools being dis
missed on account ot the funeral
of a prominent citizen it may be, but
who ig' not otlicially connected with
the school. The same thing some
times occurs in regatd to offices in the
court house. They are closed and
locked, for a brief time, to enable
those oonneoted therewith to pay a
tribute of respect to the deceased by
attendance at the last sad rites.
The subject is a delicate one to
handle. Nevertheless we are tree to
say, that while every opportunity,
consistent with public interests
should be afforded to show proper
respect for departed jones, there is no
authority for suspending public busi
ness tor tni3 purpose, unless the
deceased is a county official, when in
conformity with established custom
it is not out ot place for brother
officials to attend the funeral in a
body, and close their respective office
while the ceremonies are in progress.

Charge tor Tuition.
The trustees of the Union high
school have decided to charge all
pupils from outside districts a tuition
fee. Such action was looked for.
The burden of keeping up the school
is found to be a grievous one. Here
tofore outside pupils have been ad
mitted to the benefits of the insti
tution free of charge. That is^tc say
the people living outside the bound
aries of the several school districts
constituting the high soohol district
boundaries, have been sending their
children to the school and receiving
the benefits thereof, without one
dollar of expense. Naturally a kick
was raised at this one-sided arrange
ment. The people of the* district
were mulcted in heavy taxes to main
tain the school, and outsiders reaped
the advantage without money and
without price. So for the coming
term, which commences in September
next the trustees have, iv deference
to popular demand, and iv accord
ance with law, adopted a rule to
charge a tuition fee for the outsider.
The law fixes the amount of this fee
at the actual cost per head for the
running expenses of the school, less
tbe amount received from the state.
In other words the trustees are
authorized to place the outsider on
tbe same footing as the insider; the
only difference being that tbe parents
of outside pupils have to put up tbe
tuition fee, whereas, tbe cost of
higher education tor those living
within the district limits is borne by
a tax ou all the assessable property
in the district. The aim of the law
in this regard is, namely, that tbe
property holders of a high school
district should not be imposed upon
by paying for tuition of children
beyond tbe district borders.
it is reported that in counting up
tbe cost per pupil, tbe trustees have
found that $75 per term is about the
right fee to charge tbe outside pupils.
We do not doubt for a moment that
the valley folks have bad to pay that
rate tor keeping up the school.
Whether the cost of buying tbe school
lot and building is or should be in
cluded in estimating the expense, we
are not prepared to say. But one
thing is certain. Tbe rate establish
ed is so high that few if any out
siders will attend hereafter. To pay
67.50 per month— for that is what the
rate means— for instruction alone is
too sleep for parents to pay. To
pupils from Jackson for instance the
cost of transportation, and board
would run tbe cost up to fully 830
per month for each pupil.
HABITS OF THE RICH.
law pies of Millionaire ExtravfiganM
In the Metropolis.
Zola in his youth, before fame came
to him, wrote some stories about mil
lionaires, wherein it seemed to him he
exaggerated shamefully in his descrip
tions of the costly homes and habits of
the rich, but later on, when Zola be
came a friend of millionaires, he found
that his accounts of their extravagance
had fallen far short of the truth.
In the same way stories about the
extravagance of American millionaires
that sound like exaggerations may also
fall short of the truth. Here, for in
stance, are some fncts that an interior
decorator of New York supplied the
other day. They sound extreme, but
let Zola be remembered.
A man bought for his hall twelve
antique marble columns at Pompeii.
Finding he could use only eight of the
columns he had the remaining four de
stroyed, although he was offered for
them twice what he had paid. He had
paid $5,000 apiece.
Aubusson carpets, with a pile three
inches thick, are often made to order
at a cost of $40 a yard. Such a cost,
though, is nothing beside what is or
dinarily paid for antique rugs. They,
measured by the yard, often cost $500
or $000 a yard.
Chairs of Ivory inlaid with wood are
occasionally sold at $500 apiece.
One millionaire's piano cost $150,000.
A five inch band of ivory, four years in
the carving, runs around the case,
which was decorated by Everett Shiun.
The gold and silver plate of one

What Would M'Kenney Do?
The lone Echo of last week gets off
the following good joke on Mc-
Kenney :
It they should elect McKenney again,
Now, what would MoKenney do?
If to the senate they sent him, oh then,
Why, what would McKenney do?
Would he rustle tor jobs, to help him
along;
Or, would he keep watch, that nothing
went wrong;
Or, would he come back with an "1
don't know" song?
Well, what would McKenney do?
If he should go to the senate next
year,
Why, what would McKenney do?
Would he go to sleep, Van
Winkle, oh dear,
Now, what would McKenney do?
And when he came back, could he
tell what was done?
Whether Code bills were read, or
went through on the run?
Or, would he chase jobs, like a son-of
a-gun?
Now, what would McKenney do?
Could he tell whether a bank tax was
raised?
Now, what would McKenney do?
Would he "no sabe" and never be
feazed?
Oh, what would McKenney do?
Would he go staring blind till the
session was o'er,
While bills of importance went
through by the score,
And no*; get his sigtb for four months,
or more?
Now, what would MoKenney do?
If he don't go to the senate next year?
Why, what would McKenney do?
The voters may say, "stay home, do
you hear!"
Then what would McEienney do?
Why, he is a tailor, makes coats,
vests and pants;
Could build up bis business, his
fortunes enhance;
And in politics give some good man
a chance.
But what would McKenney do?
Caution to Water Consumers.
To stop the wastage of water during
the night, all consumers are hereby
prohibited from using water for
sprinkling or irrigating after 9 o'clock
p. m. Persons found allowing water
to run after that hour will be liable
to have the supply cut off for all
purposes. And a charge will be made
in order to have the domestic supply
turned on again. I am compelled to
adopt this rule, because the wastage
lately has been so great, that it has
been impossbile to keep the tank full
at night for protection against fire.

SCOTCH SUPERSTITIONS.
Cufloon MethouM That Were Adopted
In 'xicbtncKH Bud Death.
A method much in \ i.cue in Scotland
at one time of ascertaining whether a
sickness would prove fatal was to dig
two boles iv the ground, one called tho
quick grave, the other the dead hole.
The sufferer was then placed between
the two, and the hole toward which ho
turned indicated what would be tho
outcome of liis malady. Sometimes a
piece of rock was broken over the head
of a person whose hist agonies wero
painful alike to himself and to those
who witnessed them. It was believed
that the heart of the sick man would
thus be broken and his release hasten
ed. Windows and doors are always
thrown wide open in order that the de
parting spirit may have free egress
from the house and escape from the
evil ones that hover around eager to
lnthrall his soul.
During the interval between death
and burial hens and cats wero kopt
carefully shut up. A person meeting
these animals at such a juncture was
doomed to blindness in the future.
Moreover, unless a stream divided the
two houses, farmers frequently refrain
ed from yoking their oxen or horses be
fore the body was "laid under the turf
of truth." Many women preserved,
with the greatest reverence, their
bridal attire to cover them in the cof
fin. Bread and water were placed in
the chamber of death, for during the
night prior to the burial the spirit of
the departed one came to partake of
them. Stillborn children and little ones
who had not been blessed by the min
ister were buried before sunrise. In
this way their admission to the land of
promise was assured. Not to observe
the practice was to destine the so"ls of
these bairns to wander homeleST and
disconsolate.
The fate of the suicide is lamentable.
His body cannot rest iv the kirkyard,
for It would taint the souls of those
who lie therein. Frequently ho was
buried in n lone dike which separated
two lairds' estates, and passersby were
expected to cast a pebble at the rude
stone which marked the place.

Instinct In Birds.
In the stormy part of the year a
steamer encountered rough weather,
and, as of^on happens at such times,
many sea gulls hovered near the ship
and even came on board. One allowed
Itself to be caught, and it was found
that it had a fish bone stuck in the eye
In such a position as not absolutely to
destroy the sight, but penetrating an
inch into the flesh of the bird and pro
jecting an inch and a half. It might
have had a fight with a fish or got
transfixed seeking its prey. The doc
tor of the ship took the bird, extracted
the bone, applied a soothing remedy to
the wound and let it go. It flew away,
but returned the next day, allowing it
self to be caught. The doctor exam
ined the wound, which was progressing
favorably, applied more of the remedy
and let the bird go a second time. It
flew several times around the ship and
then departed and returned no more. —
London Sketch.
Verbal Chiropody,
The pastor, who was calling upon a
member of his congregation, asked the
name of the sprightly little daughter
whose winning ways had attracted his
attention.
"We call her Ella," said the little
girl's mother.
''That is a good name, Mrs. Donley,"
remarked the minister. "It has been
made classic by Charles Lamb."
"Well, to tell the truth," explained
Mrs. Donley, "her name ls Cornelia,
but it's easier to call her Elia."
"I see," he rejoined. "And she prob
ably likes it better. It is a painless

Fifth Monarchy Men.
The fifth monarchy men formed a re

Persian, the Babylonian and the Ro
man, would be restored, and to them
would be added a Christian monarchy,
or fifth monarchy, of which Christ
would be the king.

KAISER MAY COME.
He and King Edward VII Likely to
Meet at the Jamestown Exposi
tion.
Norfolk, Va.— The London Daily
Telegraph urges King Edward to pay
a visit to America next year. The
king's itinerary would include a visit
to Presidout Hoosevelt at Washing
ton, a sojourn in Norfolk, Virginia,
to witness the Jamestown Exposition,
which in 1907 is to commemorate the
settlement of America by English
people. It King Edward decides to
throw precedent to the winds and
again visit America— he whs here as
Prince of Wales— he will also visit
Mew York and Canada.
It is well known that the relations
between the English king and queen
and the Lodou Daily Telegraph are
most cordial. When he was Prince of
Wales, the present king was instru
mental in having the proprietor ol
the paper knighted. It is therefore
reasonable to assume that the warmth
and enthusiasm of the Daily Tele
graph over the question ot the king's
visit to America meets with the
approval and sympathy of the mon
arch. It may be, indeed, that tbe
opinions expressed were inspired by a
nod or word from the king and it
remains to be seen how the Bntish
people regard tbe matter as a whole.
At presontit looks as though the king
may yet plant a tree on tho grounds
of tbe Jamestown Expositiun, sit
under the spreading branches of tbe
great Powabatau oak, which was a
nature tree when King James granted
tbe Virginia charter, and drank from
the old Indian Spring from which
Pocahontas quenched her thirst.
That tbe Kaiser is more than likely
to visit America and tbe exposition
we may infer from a presumably in
spired article by Herr Albrecht Wirth
of Munich, one ot tbe most dis
tinguished professors at the Bavarian
University, who is a noted writer ou
political affairs and in close touch
with the imperial foreign office.
Herr Wirth thinks it more than possi
ble that Emperor William and Presi
dent Koosevelt may exchange visits.
To Mr. Harry St. George Tucker,
president of the Jamestown Exposi
tion, the Kaiser hinted that tbe Ger
man squadron, which will visit tbe
exposition next year, will be in
charge of a member of the royal
family and as he is full of surprises
what is more likely than tbat be may
command tbe Koyal Squadron in
person.
Both the king and the emperor are
sure ot a royal welcome from the
people of tbe first American states.

Serious Cutting Scrape.
A cutting affair of a serious char
acter occurred at Jackson Gate Sun
day last, resulting in one mau, Luigi
Cassassa, being dangerously wound
ed, and three others receiving cuts ot
a. superficial character. It seems
from all that we cau make out, tbat
the affair was the outcome of a feud
tbat had existed between tbe priu
cipals concerned tor some time.
Cassassß was a boarder at the liernero
plaoe, and on tbe day in question had
been having a drink or two with
friends in the Gate village. It was
proposed that they adjourn to the
Badaracco saloon, which is on the
Jackson Gate road just beyond the
city limits of Jackson. Tho narty of
threo or tour had scarcely reached
tbe bar, when two brothers, John and
Steve Garbarino appeared ou tbe
scene. Tbesa two evidently enter
tained no good wishes of Cassassa.
How they came to appear just at the
time is not known. They were in
vited to drink, and did so, but in
such an offensive manner as to call
forth remarks. A tew words led to a
quarrel, and the parties were ordered
out. Tbe Garbarinos passed outside
first, aud as soon as Cassassa got out
side trouble began. John is a big
powerful man, and was armed with a
knife. Steve' is a smaller man, and
seized a chair as his weapon of
olfense. Both made for Cassassa as
soon as be got out. Tbe others inter
posed in tbe desire to stop the fight,
and a mixup occurred. The outcome
was tbat Cas3assa received a knife
wound at tbe band of John Garbarino,
the blade entering the left side,
penetrating tbe cavity and making a
cut in tbe lower part of tbe left lung.
A man named Andrew Gilardi was
cut across the shoulder. Another
man named Garbariuo, no relative of
tbe two principals above named,
reoeived alight cuts. Steve Garbar
ino was damaged in the melee by
getting a superficial cut in tbe fore
bead. Cassassa was badly hurt, and
was packed home by his companions.
The sheriff's office was notified, and
arrested John and Steve Garbarino.
and landed them in jail to await tbe
result ot their victim's injuries, be
fore a formal charge is made against
them. It is believed that the attack
was deliberately planned beforehand
While Cassassa's injuries are serious,
it is thought he will recover, although
this cannot be definitely determined
for several days yet.

Tim Haw, formerly of Sutter Creek,
accompanied by J. Trails from

this week, for the purpose of looking

skating rink. Jackson ought to be a
good town in which to start such an
amusement. The trouble is would
the prospective income justify the big
outlay required to start. Several
desirable sites could be obtained, but
all requiring a considerable expendi
ture in putting down a floor. Of
course, no ball is suitable, as tbe
skates would destroy the best dancing
floor in short order. It is customary
to build a special floor for skating to
avoid this trouble.

Jackson, July 20, 1900.
Suspected Incendiarism.
Several mysterious fires occurred
| last Monday in tho neighborhood of
the Broadway hotel, which gave birth
to considerable alarm in that viciuity,
as the impression was general that
another firebug nad got to wurk for
some malicious or mischievous pur
pose. The tirst fire was notioeil about
y o'clock in the morning. It started
in the grass some 300 feet south of
tbe hotel, and close to a cabin used
by the hotel for sleeping purposes.
Oue of the boarders noticed the blaze
in its iucipiency, and raised the
alarm. Help promptly came, and the
flames were extinguished after they
had burned over a tew square feet of
grass. About an hour thereafter,
attention was attracted by smoke
from the same cabin. This time the
tire was inside the cabin. It was put
out after destroying a pair of mat
tresses aud a couple of blankets.
About five o'clock in the afternoon
another alarm of lire was sounded.
This time it proved to be in a rented
bouse on tbe opposite side of the
street from the hotel, and used as a
sleeping place in connection with the
hotel business. It was discovered in
the nick of time, and was put out,
after destroying a pair of overalls
and a vest belonging to one of tbe
lodgers. There was no one in tbe
house at the time, hut a child, nine
or ten years old, was seen coming
from the premises just before the
alaim was given. Some papering ou
the wall was damaged.
The officers were, notified, aud
deputy sheriff Kay looked into 'he
matter. The affair bore all the marks
of incendiarism, and suspicion was
directed to a nine year old gill
named Alvora Burnett, whose pareuts
live next to the Broadway hotel.
This child was noticed leaving the
dwelling immediately before the
alarm of tire was given. After some
questioning, she liually admitted that
sbe started tbe fires, and told how
she started them. Sbe appears to
have a mania that way. It did not
appear that she was actuated by
revengeful motives. She was chas
tised by her parents for her doings,
and this, it was hoped would cure
her of her destructive propensity.
But it did not, as tbe sequel shows.
Tuesday morning another effort was
made to start a fire in the cabin lot
first mentioned, and ibis time tbe
young firebug was detected in the
act. 11. D. Emerson in coming to
town saw the girl running away from
the little red cabin. She went across
the street towards the Fregulia place.
A tew seconds thereafter the ory of
fire arose. Fire had started in the
lot ou which the cabin is built. It
burned over, a few feet, aud was put
out. Mrs. Marcucci, who it seems
was on the lookout for the rnovo
meuts of the child, says she saw tho
girl deliberately throw a lighted
match iuto the grass, and run away.
Ther« was much excitement. The
girl was taken in charge, and placed
in jail. Owing to her tender age she
was given a talking to, and let go.
The neighbors are not satisfied.
The girl, iv spite of chastisement,
started the fire again. Persons liviug
thereabouts do not feel safe, and
something will be done to secure
protection.
Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. For
weak indigestion, for defective nour
ishmeut, for consumption, take
Scott's Emulsion. It restores flesh
because it strikes to the cause of tho
loss.

A Fishing Expedition Marred.
Harold Lemoin aud Johnny Dela
hide, boys about 16 years of age,
started out Monday moruing for a
fishing expedition to Tabeau reser
voir. Young Delahide furnished the
horse, and the buggy and harness
belonged to the father ot Harold,
Fred Lemoiu, of the county hospital.
They reached tho sporting grounds
without mishap, and took the pre
caution before eutering upon the
angling sport, to uubitch the horse,
aud stake it out It was staked
rather close to the ditch. At noou
the boys went to see to the- horse
and found him all right. During the
afternoon they again went to the
spot where the animal had been
staked, and fouud that it had fallen
into the ditch, and was either drown
ed or broke its neck in the fall.
They tried to get the horse out, but
the task was too much for them.
They had to- return home on foot,
aud reported the misfortune to their
parents. On Wednesday with assist
auce they went to the spot and took
the horse out ot the ditch. It was
a valuable animal, and young Dola
hide feels keenly its loss under the
circumstances.
it is always well to have a box of
salve in the house. Sunburns, cuts,
bruises, piles and boils yield to De
witt's Witch Hazel Salve. Should
keep a box on hand at all times, to

Lee Worley and troup gave a
musical in Love's Hall last Tuesday
evening. Ihe weather was excessive
ly hot, and this militated against
the attendance. Worley is one of
California's accomplished violinists,
aud a native of Amador county. He
has been visiting his brother, Fred
Lie Mom in Jackson. The gentleman
is well known here, his home being
in Drytown. When a boy he lived
on a ranch near Drytowu, and hslped
his father iv the field. Lee was
ambitious, his passiou was the love
of music, lie purchased a toy violiu
upon which he picked up several
tunes; that did not satisfy him. The
time came when he must do better
aud seeing one in a nearby town pur
chased it. People were so pleased
with his music, that he was advised
to go wiiere he might take lessons,
which he did. He soon became
leader ot an orchestra iv a theater in
Seattle, and vow he is back among
his friends agaiu.

A FRIGHTENED ACTRESS."
■When Malibran Ran For Her L,lfe
From Her Father.
Ualibraii was an exceptional woman
as well as a great singer, and she had
an interesting and spontaneous tem
perament. The daughter of Garcia,
she had ;i?af.rsh and difficult master in
her own father.
When she was sixteen he one daj'
came to her room and without any
kind of preparation said to her, ''You
will make your first appearance with
me on Saturday in 'Otello.' "
It gave her exactly six days for prep
aration. The child, terrified nearly into
speeehlessness, stammered that she
could not possibly do it— what he asked
was impossible. But Garcia could take
no contradiction. All he answered
was: "You'll make your first appear
ance on Saturday, and be perfect. If
not, In the last scene, when I am sup
posed to plunge my dagger into your
breast, I'll do so in real earnest."
The frightened girl had to make the
best of it. Her success was absolute,
but one little piece of realism in her
acting at the end was a delicious
though entirely unconscious piece of
retaliation upon her father for a rather
brutal method. Her Desdemona had
been exquisite; she had made her what
she was herself, a child, Innocent and
submissive and adoring.
But in the last act, when Othello
strode toward her with uplifted dag
ger, la Malibran, truly frightened out
of her wits, ran away from him and
made for windows and doors, frantic
ally trying to escape. When her father
at last caught hold of her, so real had
the whole thing become that, seizing
the hand with which he was supposed
to murder her, she bit it till it bled.
Garcia gave a cry of pain, which the
audience took for a cry of rage, and the
act ended in deafening applause for
father and daughter.
The Incident reveals la Malibran.
She was never, In one sense of the
word, an actress at all. There was no
studied counterfeit of emotions, but a
woman with an extraordinary power
of losing herself in the emotions of
others.— T. P.'s Weekly.
FORCED TO EAT BOOKS.
Human Beinga Who Were Compelled
to Devour Literature.
Amoiig the causes that contribute to
the destruction of books, says an Ital
ian writer, Americo Scarlatti, there is
one very curious one that may be called
bibllophagia. No reference is intended
to the mice that once destroyed in
England an entire edition of Castell's
"Lexicon Heptaglotton," but to human
beings who have literally devoured
books.
In 1370 Barnabo Vlscontl compelled
two papal delegates to eat the bull of
excommunication which they had
brought him, together with Its silkefli
cords and leaden seal. As the bull was
written on parchment, says the Scien
tific American, not paper, It was all the
more difficult to digest.
A similar anecdote was related by
Oelrich in his "Dissertatio de Bibllo
thecaruni et I.lbrarum Fatis" (l~.">0) of
an Austrian general who had signed a
note for 2,000 florins and when it foil
due compelled his creditors to eat it.
The Tartars, when books fall Into
their possession, eat them that they
may acquire the knowledge contained
In them.
A Scandinavian writer, tho author of
a political book, was compelled to
choose between being beheaded or eat
ing his manuscript boilod in broth.
Isaac Volmar, who wrote some spicy
satires against Bernard, duke of Sax
ony, was not allowed the courtesy of
the kitchen, but was forced to swallow
them uncooked.
Still worse was the fate of Philip
Oldenbureor, a Jurist of great renown,
who was condemned not only to o;it a
pamphlet of his writings, but also to
be flogged during his repast, with or
ders that the flogging should not cease
until he had swallowed the last crumb.
Terror Snved Her.
A tale of a paralytic and n stroke of
lightning: For twenty-two years n wo
man had been paralyzed, unable to
leave her room. One night when she
happened to be alone in the house a
fierce storm broke. The poor woman
was terrified by the thunder and the
blinding glare of the lightning. With
an effort of which no one had believed
her capable she struggled from her bed
and to the house of a neighbor. Barely
had she reached safety when the place
she had just left was struck by light
ning. The room in which she had lived
so long was rent in two and every
thing in it was burned or smashed.
Power of locomotion had been restored
to the cripple just in time to save her
life.— Chicago News.

Thronged Historic U ty. -Church

HilL.Monument.
The dedication in June of a mag
nificent new addition to the Mother
Church of the Christian Science de
nomination, in Boston, was an event
of the highest significance in the his
tory of this religious body.
Built as the result of a spontaneous
recognition of Mrs. Eddy's life work and
of the imperative demands of the mar
velous growth of the movement, ex
pressing the liberality of thousands of
Christian Scientists, and embodying
the best in architectural design and
modern construction, this new building
was logically the central feature of
this year's gathering.
The church is one of the largest, If
not the largest in the United States,
its seating capacity being 5,012. Its
style of architecture is Italian Renais
sance. The pews and other interior
finishings are of mahogany. The
■v alls are Concord granite and Bedford
stone, with beautiful decorative carv
ings. The inside finish is a soft gray
to harmonize with the Bedford stone
columns supporting the dome. The
height of the building to the top of the
lantern is 224 feet, just one foot higher
than Bunker Hill monument. The
dome is eighty-two feet in diameter
and is covered with terra cotta to
match the Bedford stone. The build
ing presents a stately, dignified and
Impressive appearance, and it Is al
ready recognized as one of the land
marks of Boston.
The cost of the building is some
thing less than $2,000,000. The new
chimes consist of eleven bells, the
largest of which weighs 4,000 pounds.
The smallest bell weighs 400 pounds.
The organ is one of the largest and
finest in the world.
The original "Mother Church" which
adjoins the new building seats about
1,200, and yet three Sunday services
are required to accomodate the attend
ance. It is said that when this edifice

was planned some of the members
were disturbed on account of its size.
They thought that the provision of so
large an auditorium was entirely un
called for, the attendance at that time
being only about 550.
Mrs. Eddy, organized the First
Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston
in 1879 with twenty-six members. So
slow was the growth of the movement
at first that in ISB9, ten years later,
there were only eleven churches.
From that time, however, the increase
was more rapid. In 1899, there were
301 churches. There are now 657
churches and 275 societies not yet or
ganized as churches, making 032 so
cieties holding church services. In
1889 there were only 450 members in
the entire connection. In 1894 the
total membership was 2.536. Five
years later it had reached 18,134.
These figures show that the principal
growth has taken place during the
past seven years. The membership at
the present time is about 72.000.
The dedicatory exercises were at
tended by visitors from all parts of
the United States and Canada, from
Great Britain, Australia, Sweden, Den
mark, France, Germany, Switzerland,
the Hawaiian Islands, South America
and other foreign countries.
One hundred and forty-five church
edifices have already been erected by
the Christian Scientists. These, as a
whole, compare favorably with those
of the older denominations. It is
said that when funds are no longer
needed for the completion of the
Mother Church a large number of
buildings will be commenced in dif
ferent parts of the country.
EARTHQUAKE RECORDERS.
They Are the Most Delicate of All
Instruments.
The instruments invented for the
recording of the motions of the earth's
crust during an earthquake are looked
upon by scientists as the most deli
cate of all machines. So highly sen
sitive are they, indeed, that the very
slightest vibratory motion is recorded
perfectly. Even the tread of feet can
not escape this instrument, if sufficient
to cause vibration.
There are three classes of instru
ments for the automatic recording of
earthquakes, each with its own partic
ular function. First is the seismo

scope, which will merely detect and re
cord the fact that there has been an
earth tremor. Some of these are so
equipped as to indicate the time of
the disturbance.
Second is the seismometer, the func
tion of which is to measure the maxi
mum force of the shock, either with or
without an indication of its direction.
The third instrument is the seismo
graph, which is so arranged that \t
will accurately record the number, suc
cession, direction, amplitude and
period of successive oscillations. The
last instrument is by far the most
delicate of the three.
In the construction of this earth
quake-recording machine the maker
must so suspend a heavy body that
when its normal position is disi.urbed
in the most infinitesimal degree, no re
actionary force will be developed
tending to restore it to its original
position. The inventor has never been
found who could accomplish this sus
pension of a body to perfection. The
seismograph of to-day, however, has
reached a stage of perfection where
close approximations are obtained in
the records made.
The complementary part of the in
strument Is composed of a system of
levers connecting an astatically sus
pended body with various surfaces
that are moved by clockwork. These
surfaces are constructed of highly sen
sitive material, on which needles play
as the suspended weight responds to
the vibrations of the earth's crust.
The most elaborate of these ma
chines are capable of recording the
vertical and two horizontal motions
of the earth in the case of a seismic
disturbance.

Mother Administers an Addi

An interesting little story of very
human interest comes from the river
front on the outskirts of New York
City where Signora Genaro, who re
cently came to this country from
Naples, was walking the other day with
her seven-year-old son, Antonio, for an
airing. AVhile she was watching a
passing steamboat the little chap
frisked along the pier and then —
splash, into the river.
The mother's shrieks were heard by
a patrolman. He jumped into a boat
and fished out Antonio. The police
man had only one oar, and it was
awkward work getting to the boy and
lifting him into the boat.
When the signora saw that her son
was safe the anguish in her face gave
way to a look of resolute purpose, and
as the dripping Antonio was placed on
the wharf she laid him across her knee
and did what Neapolitan and other
mothers have done to their erring
jewels ever since boys wore pants.

A Boston couple were recreating

They invited her to pay them a visit,
and the colored woman accepted, es

In due time she arrived in Boston
and was installed in the house of the
white folks. She was given one of the
best rooms, and ate a f the same table
with her host and hostess.
At one of the meals the hostess said:
"Mrs. Jones, you were a slave, weren't
you?"
"Yes, mum," replied the old colored
woman. "I belonged to Mars Robert
Howell."
"I suppose he never invited you to

RENAMING THE SIOUX.
SOME TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND
INDIANS ARE RECeIVING
CHRISTIAN NAMES,
I Educated Indian Tribesmen Selected
by the ''Great Father" 10 Ke
christen Braves -Bob-tailed Coyute
Becomes Robert T. Wolf.
Uncle Sam has recently inaugurated
a unique and ingenious project in con
nection with his Indian wards — or
at least the most populous division
of them. This is nothing less than a
scheme for renaming every chief and
brave, every squaw and papoose of
the Sioux tribe. The object of this
wholesale rechristening Is to insure the
right descent of property, something
that has been attended with much
difficulty under the old condition of
affairs when the Sioux had no family
name, and each redskin could be
identified only by his own individual
fanciful name, a cognomen which most
likely had not the slightest resemb
lance to those of any of his relatives.
The renaming of the 25,000 mem
bers of the Sioux Indian tribe was or
dered by President Roosevelt on the
advice of Hamlin Garland and George
Bird Grinnell, well known authors,
and other persons who have made a
study of the needs of the Indians.
To decide upon the r naming was
however an easy matter in comparison
to the actual carrying out of the
strange undertaking.
SUSPICIONS OF THE INDIANS.
The President and his advisors real
ized from the outset that it would be
one thing to give the Indians new
names and quite another to induce the
sons and daughters of the forest —
ever suspicious of the white men — to
accept and use these new names.
However, the Great Father at Washing
ton was fortunate enough to enlist the
cooperation of Dr. Charles Alexander
Eastman, a highly educated physician
and clergyman, who is a full-blooded
Sioux, and who came into national
prominence some time since when he
married Elane Goodale, the talented
young New England poetess. At the
President's solicitation Dr. Eastman,
who is considered the best educated
Indian in the world, agreed to person
ally undertake the task of inducing his
people to adopt the system of family
names desired by the government.
Just what this responsibility meant
will be better understood when It is
explained that not only was Dr. East
man to visit all the Indian villages of
the Sioux tribe and personally bestow
names but he must also devise or in
vent the new names. Just imagine
selecting given names for 25,000 per
sons of both sexes and apportioning
perhaps half as many or one third as
many different family names in ad
dition.
In this portion of his novel mission
ary work for Uncle Sam the Name
Giver, as the Sioux now term their
educated tribesman, has displayed rare
judgment and a fine regard for family
history and tradition among the Sioux
— a thoughtfulness that has done
much to win the good will of these
intelligent but conservative Indians
for the new project. Whenever pos
sible he has perpetuated an Indian's
old name in his new one. For instance
High Eagle becomes Mr. Higheagle,
Bob-tailed Coyote was changed to
Robert T. Wolf, and Rotten Pumpkin
has been transformed into Robert
Pumpian
Dr. Eastman has been making a
round of all the Sioux reservations
which are located for the most part
in the Dakotas and elsewhere in the
Northwest. When he arrives at a
branch agency, or tribal headquarters,
for the purpose of rechristening the
inhabitants his first move is to have
a conference with the chief men or
counselors of the place. They, in turn,

send out a herald or town crier to
summon all the people to a sort of
mass meeting and at this the "Xame
Giver" explains the President's wishes
at length.
THROUGH INDIAN SUBTLETY.
At the outset many of the assembled
Indians may be prone to grumble
against the new system, but grad
ually Dr. Eastman will win them over,
and in his labors thus far he has not
encountered more thnn half a dozen
Indians who have steadfastly refused
to change their names However,
hundreds of the Indians have con
fided to him that they would accept
the new system of names only because
they had the assurance of a fellow
tribesman (Dr. Eastman) that it was
a good plan, and that they would
never have tolerated it had a white
man come among them and broached
the «clieme.
Although the renaming of the Sioux
lis not yet completed it has already
been proven that the new system of
uaui's will be of me greatest
benefit and value in insuring the cor
rect descent of Government allot
ments of land from generation to gen
eration. Incidentally it may be noted
that even thus early this untangling
of lines of descent has won for some
Indians valuable property rights pre
viously denied them. As a case in
point it may be cited that only a few
weeks ago Dr. Eastman was intru
mental in securing fcr a young squaw
040 acres of rich land of high value
which had been temporarily lost to
her owing to her separation from her
own tribe, and which an unscrupulous
relative was on the point of selling
when President Roosevelt's special
commissioner stepped in and set
things right.

THE BLACK
SEAL PURSE.
"Snatch it! Snatch it!" whispered
Reddy the "lookout," pal to "Jimmy
the Swift," who won this title from
the lightning rapidity with which he
was known to relieve men's pockets
of their contents.
In a moment the practiced fingers
of Jimmy had skillfully extracted a
flat seal purse from the pocket of a
slight young man who was busily
elbowing his way th ough the crowd
that was besieging a belated Broad
way car.
The day had not been a rich one for
the "picks," and Swifty eyed the thin
purse rather suspiciously.
"Mighty slim-looking, hey, Red?"
In reply Reddy drew up one side of
his face, exposing his deep yellow
canines, pulled the remnants of a hat
over his arms, and, leaning against
the side of a great building In quiet
shadow, struck an attitude that
seemed to say, "Well, here I am, pre
pared -for anything — go ahead and
show your booty."
Somehow Swifty was slower than
usual in bringing his "snatch" to light.
He felt the purse, pressed it between
his bands turned it over and over, and
at last, seeing Reddy's eyes flash im
patience, he reluctantly opened the
pocketbook.
"Well, I'll be smothered!" cried
Reddy, as Jim pulled out a faded pink
envelope from which fell a lock of
gray hair and a newspaper clipping
bearing the seared marks of time. It
was an obituary, praising the life and
work of the deceased. The dead
woman, it said, had been an exemplary
wife and mother, and one of the
sweetest, noblest and most honored
members of the community. Her loss
was therefore mourned by every one
who had the happiness of knowing her.
She left an only son. All this the boy
read aloud, amid frequent stops to

listened with a cynical smile. At the
end of the reading he was about to
shout with derisive laughter, when
Jim, springing forward, collared him,
and with a tone utterly new to him,
said sternly:
"Look here, Red! You and I's
friends — that's all right; but as sure
as I'm a thief, this here ain't no stuff
for a feller to laugh at!"
For an answer Red thrust his hands
into his pockets, eying Jim curiously
the while, and turned on one foot with
a long low whistle.
"I never had no mother," murmured
Jim. "She died when I was a little
chap, so I never knew her, but it must
be awfully nice for a feller to have
a mother like that to be good to him,
and learn him things. Why, who
knows, perhaps if you and me had had
mothers like that livin', instead of
bein' kicked 'round by t^e 'boss', who
never gets enough out of us, we might

These words of regret upon the past
of his young life, and the expressed
desire for something better, from one
whose only home almost since In
fancy had been the street, and whose
companions had been crooks and
ne'er-do-wells, was too much for the
incorrigible Reddy, whose worship
consisted of heroes that were daring
villains, and not penitent sinners.

sneer:
"You — am't — goin' — to squeal on ac

The habit of years could not be
overcome in a moment. Goaded by
his tempter, Jimmy stealthily leaped
forward, and in a second his fingers
would have been on the bunch of
paper money which the evil eye of
Reddy "spotted" in the old man's
pocket. Like a flash came the sight
of the purse, the gray lock of hair, the
words in the newspaper that made
such an impression upon him — no, he
would not, he could not any more.
His hand dropped to his side. The
old man disappeared with the money,
safe from Jimmy's wicked fingers.
Jim's head sank until his chin rested
upon his naked chest, his companion
glaring at him with eyes furious with
anger.
"Well, 'taint no use," said Jim,
quietly but firmly; "I couldn't, Red,
somehow, after that— and I'll never
try it again.
"You get another pal— if you want

THE INDEPENDENT TOWN.
Make Each Rural Center Dependent
Upon Itself and Its Own Resources.
There has lately developed a strong
sentiment looking to the improvement
of the home town — making each
community, as much as possible,
dependent upon itself and its own
resources and those of its sur
rounding country, and independ
ent of the great centres which are
constantly striving to secure a portion
of the local wealth. This local self
sufficiency may be fostered by an in
dividual and co-operative determi
nation to bring the town up to its
highest possible plane of comfort, gen
eral usefulness and beauty to its resi
dents. This may be described as a
movement for civic improvement.
The accumulation of considerable
wealth in many American villages and
towns, during the last ten or twenty
years, the development of popular
education and the increase of leisure,
has given an opportunity for the per
formance of public duties, such as
had not seemed to exist to the young
man or woman of the former gener
ation, who, in the effort to secure a
livelihood and establish a home had
given little thought to the duties of
citizenship and social responsibilities.]
It is only within a comparatively
few years that, "nature study" has
entered into any of the public-school
work, or even manual training, while
there are many who yet think that
such Institutions as gymnasiums,
baths, playgrounds, and even vacation
schools and free lectures are unneces
sary time-consumers for the young.
Nevertheless the general movement
for a better education along rural lines
and for backyard and street improve
ment, and the general betterment of
the village and town is rapidly in
creasing.
As an Instance of this, even in such
a large city as St. Louis, girls and
boys are given practical instruction in
gardening, through the Junior School
of Horticulture of the Missouri
Botanical Gardens. The children are
permitted to sell their own products—
a decided stimulus to their e_orts
— and in this way many of them earn
considerable pocket money for vacation
time. This school has been in oper
ation for a number of years and is of
great value to the citizens as well as
to the children of the city, the latter

Even in Texas the school garden
and town improvement idea has made
headway, although there has been
greater difficulty ln obtaining popular
approval and support, possibly, than in
any other section of the country, owing
to the fact, perhaps, that the Lone
Star State has vast areas of unoc

Centralized portion of society has taken
the matter up, and It is stated that
the most public-spirited citizens of
the towns and cities, together with the
progressive teachers have made school
gardens and rural education a success
during the past two seasons and have
aroused such enthusiasm among the
pupils, that wherever it has been tried,
the school garden has become a fixture.
"Let your child plant his own gar
den, gather his own harvest of fruit
and flowers, learn through his own
small experience something of the
influence of the sun, dew and rain,
and gain thereby a remote presenti
ment of the reciprocal energies of
nature and a reverent feeling for the
divine life and law expressed in

THE AGRICULTURAL HIGHSCHOOI
Successful Examples Described by
Crosby of Department of Agricul
ture of Local improvement
Through Rural Education
In the new Year Book of the De
partment of Agriculture, just issued,
is a description by D. J. Crosby, of the
ofiice of. Experiment Stations, which
shows, in a number of instances, what
splendid results are being attained
through the introduction of common
sense agricultural studies in some of
the country village schools, and how
they directly affect and benefit their
home towns. There is what appears
to be, an almost ideal Pennsylvania
village high school, which the writer
visited. He describes what he saw:
In Erie County, Pa., surrounded by
a good general farming and dairy
country, is the village of Waterford,
on the outskirts o€ which is the site of
Fort le Boeuf, of French and India
war fame. At Waterford the first
school in Erie County was establish. 1
in 1800, and here as far back as 1822
was erected a stone academy build
in. ir. which is used to-day as the rfain
part of the high-school building. The
township of Waterford has a popula
tion of 1,460 and about one haii re
side in the borough of Waterf--d. Tr»
borough has its own elementary
school, but the high school is support
ed and controlled jointly by the bor
ough and township.
This high school, with its three
teachers and three courses of study
(language, scientific, and agricultural),
has an enrollment of 80 pupils, and 35
of these are in the agricultural course.
This course includes agriculture, five
hours a week for four years. The
work of the first year is devoted to a
study of plant life — germination, plant
growth, plant food, reproduction, prop
agation, transplanting, pruning, and
use of plants; the second year to a
study of field, orchard, and garden
crops; the third year to domestic ani
mals, dairying, and s»U physics, a~ 1
the fourth year to the chemistry of
soils and of plant and animal life.
Text books are used in the class
rooms; a small library of agricultural
reference books, reports and bulletins
of this Department and experiment
stations, and agricultural papers con
tributed by the publishers is in almost
constant use, and lectures on agricul
tural subjects are given before the
class and before the whole school by
the instructor in agriculture, who is
an agricultural college graduate. But
the feature of instruction which
chiefly distinguishes this agricultural
course from the ordinary high school
course is the prominence given to the
laboratory work and the outdoor prac
ticum. For the laboratory work there
is no elaborate apparatus. The pupils
make much of their own apparatus,
furnish their own reagent bottles, and,
moreover use them. In the plant-life
course the pupils study not elaborate
and carefully prepared drawings, but
the plants themselves with reference
to their life history and economic uses.
For the outdoor practicum the
school is unfortunate in having
neither land nor domestic animals nor
fowls, and yet it has a wealth of illus
trative material all around it. Every
good farm within a radius of 3 or 4
miles, nearly every barn and poultry
yard in the village, the butcher shops,
and the farm implement stores furnish
costly illustrative material and extend
vastly the teaching force of the high
school. The farmers and owners of
good live stock either bring ther ani
mals to the door of the school house
to be studied by the class in agricul
ture or allow the class to go to their
barns and fields for this purpose. It
is said to be a rare thing for a good
horse to come to the village and get
away without being examined by the
high school class in animal husbandry.
Thfe writer was fortunate in being
the guest of the school one day last
October and in having an opportunity
to listen to some of the recitations in
agriculture. A class of 14 boys and
6 girls were studying animal industry.
It had been organized only three or
four weeks, and yet the interest man
ifested and the readiness with which
the boys and girls described the beef
type, the dairy type, and various
breeds of cattle, the mul on and wool
types of sheep, the principal breeds of
draft horses, and some of the stand
ard-bre,d roadsters and trotters, were
indeed surprising. At the close of the
recitation the class was taken to a
barn in the village w" ere ■ veru- fine
roadsters were owned. The owner was
not at home, but the teacher had
standing permission to take it ■ horses
from the barn in order that the class
might examine them. A fine Hamble
tonian mare was led into the yard and
examined critically by the pupils and
criticised by them, the different points
being brought out by skillful question
ing on the part of the teac- _•.
Fom this place the class went to a
livery barn where a splt-idid black
Percheron stallion was stabled for the
day. A member of the class had dis
covered the horse as he was jeing
driven in from another town 14 miles
away, and following the driver to the
barn had got permission for the class
to examine him. When the livery
barn was reached the driver brought
bis stallion out into the street, put
him through his paces, and helped the
teacher in calling attention to his good
points and the contrasts between t c
draft type and the roadster type of
horses, and allowed us to take several
photographs. It was an instructive
lesson not only for the members
of the agricultural class, but for
the score or more of farmers
and townsmen who collected around
the livery stable. In much the
same way the local butcher is the in
structor in the high school. The class
studying the beef type of cattle, or
the mutton sheep, or the different
classes of swine is taken to the butch
er shop and given a demonstration
lesson on cuts and their relative val
ues, which of the breeds are apt to
produce the better cuts, .which the
better quality, ant so on.
Thus this little village high school,
though it pays only $2,230 a year in
WATERFORD HIGH SCHOOL CLASS JUDGING A HAMBLETONIAN MARE
salaries and only $370 for other ex
penses, has a faculty made up of nu
merous specialists and an equipment
In illustrative material such as few
technical high schools could afford.
And the pupils are being trained in
the "elements of failure and success,"
not only on "all the farms of the
neighborhood," but in the villa.cc
shops and markets. This is training
for efficiency. It is training for cui
ture, for breadth of view, and for
sympathy with all that goes to make
up the life of the community.
Homeeroft and Craft.
The "homeeroft" idea, referred to by
George H. Maxwell in his address be
fore the Biennial Convention of the
General Federation of Women's Clubs,
is closely allied to the "home arts and
crafts" propaganda, in which so many,
in and out of the federation, are inter
ested. The homecrofter, owning his
home and a little patch of ground — an
acre or two, more or less — is of all
persons the one most likely to be inter
ested in home crafts — little lines of
manufacture, which, added to the pro
duce of his ground, may afford a sup
port to his family, either constantly or
as a substitute for wage-earning em
ployment when some great shop or
factory may be suspended. Aided,
perhaps, by a little gas engine or elec
tric motor, he may have a choice of an
infinite variety of crafts, to which he
and his family may profitably engage.
Here is a combination which seems to
offer relief from the demoralizing and
devitalizing conditions of our present
factory system; also a mode of multi
plying the number of those citizens,
independent of both landlord and em
ployer, who are the backbone of
American democracy. Give us the
homecrofter and the craftsman in one!
Keep Polities Oat.
Every public-minded citizen should
make it known that he is absolutely
opposed to partisan, political control
in the management of public parks,
roadside improvement playgrounds
and like town betterments. Nothing
can be more detrimental to such de
velopment than the interference of
politics. Party responsibility, as a
remedy for municipal mismanagement,
has been prove l a "delusion and a
snare." Such methods have raised to
important places bigoted, incompetent
and sometimes dishonest men, who, by
reason of their weaknesses or mis
management, have disgraced what
should be honorable and respected
positions. Our citizens should insist
absolutely that no political consider
ations be allowed to interfer with
p;;rk affairs, and should visit with
marked censure and disapproval all
city officials who prostitute their trusts
for mere political gain.
Fresh Air Playgrounds.
American citios are far behind
European cities in making provision
for public parks, especially in pro
viding for the instruction and amuse
ment of children in them. In modern
municipal equipment in Europe, much
provision is made for the Instruction
and amusement of children, and in
most modernized European cities large
sums of money have been expended in
procuring open spaces for them in dis
tricts of congested population.
OPPORTUNITIES AT HOME.
PERNICIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF JOHN
J. INGALLS' FAMOUS POEM.—
HOW HOME OPPORTUNI
TIES HAYb BEEN
OVERLOOKED.
Solution of the Labor Question to be
Found in the Development of Hou.c
Industries.
Many a beautiful thing is pernicious
in its effect. There is no telling how
many men have given up a good fight
ing chance and have literally laid
down in harness because they had ab
sorbed from John J. Ingalls' poem
OPPORTUNITY the idea that they
had had their chance, and that for
them at least opportunity would not
return. Here is the poem:
"Master of human destinies am I,
Fame, love and fortune on my foot
steps wait.
Cities and fields I walk. I penetrate
Deserts and seas remote. And pass
ing by
Hovel and mart and palace, soon or
late
I knock unbidden once at every
gate.
If sleeping wake; if feasting rise
before
I turn away; it is the hour of fate.
And those who follow me reach every
state
Mortals desire and conquer every
every foe
Save death; but those who doubt or
hesitate.
Condemned to failure, penury and
woe,
Seek me in vain, and uselessly im
plore;
I answer not, and I return no more."
A beautiful poem — yes, but pernic
ious as is the theory of fate or the
twin tenet of predestination. If oppor
tunity comes but once, where is the
use of striving. :(,
President James of the University
of Illinois during the recent commence-
ment exercises took occasion to refer
to the philosophy of Ingalls' famous
poem. "It is false and misleading,"
said Mr. James. "It is not a single op
portunity which comes to a man; it Is
a train. It is a never-ending proces
sion, some small, some large, growing
perhaps more small and more insignifi
cant as the years flow on, but ever
and always opportunities too numer
ous, too great, and too large for us to
utilize fully."
This is good, healthful optimism.
There never was a time when opportu
nities of all shapes, sizes and colors
bobbed up on every corner as they do
to-day And they are not confined to
any particular country or locality.
They are waiting everywhere. Under
the rapidly changing industrial and
economical conditions they are spring
ing up in odd and out-of-the-way
places. Old settlements—old villages,
moss-grown and for years silent as
the cemetery that clings to their
skirts, are finding new youth in the
revival of occupations and simple in
dustries which twenty years ago were
deemed impossible. The abandoned
farms of New England—The farms
that were left tenantless because it
was thought that the only opportun
ities for success were to be found in
the West—are receiving new leases of
life.
PEXDTTLmi IS SWINGING BACK.
For a full half century the American
people have been money-mad. Every
thing has been sacrificed to the one
idea of accumulation. The dollar sign
became the sole badge of honor, and a
man's success was measured not by
what he made of himself, not by what
he accomplished for his fellows or the
world at large, but by the size of his
pile.
This standard of success has warp
ed the imagination of the whole peo
ple. The merchant and professional
man bend every energy to the pil
ing up of gold bricks. And the farmer,
not to be outdone, lies awake nights
thinking how he may get more land.
He has now more than he can till,
but the land lust has seized him and
home comforts and a quiet life are sold
in the market in order that the line
fence may be removed
This has been the condition for
many years, and it requires careful
observation to detect any change. But
a reaction has set in. The pendulum is
swinging back. A growing sentiment
in favor of a moderate success, a quiet
life and home surroundings is appar
ent. With this comes a desire to get
back to original principles: to abandon
the cities and seek the healthful life
of the farm and the village.
The growth of our cities has been
abnormal—the direct result of ab
normal transportation conditions. "To
him that hath shall be given, and to
him that hath not even that which he
hath shall be taken away." has been
the working policy of modern com
mercial transportation companies.
The small town has been sacrificed to
the city. This was the natural result
of competition. In centers where
numerous railroads meet, low rates
are given to both the in-going and out
going freight, but where there i<* but
one road, the traffic is taxed all that it
will bear. This condition has had a

This book is the first of a Series
that will Chronicle the Progress of the
HOMECROFT MOVEMENT
and inform all who wish to co-operate
with it how they may do so through
the formation of local Homecrofters'
Circles, Clubs or Gilds to promote
Town and Village Betterment, stimu-
late home civic pride and loyalty to
home Institutions, industries and trade,
improve methods and facilities of edu-
cation in the local public schools, and
create new opportunities "At Home"
that will go far to check the drift of
trade and population to the cities.
The first Gild of the Homecroftera
has been established at Watertown,
Massachusetts. The GlldhalL Shops
and Gardens are located at 143 Main
Street, where the Garden School is
now fully organized and over one
hundred children are at work in the
Gardens. The departments for train-
ing in Homecraft and Village Indus-

are already at work at the looms.
It is not designed to build here an
isolated institution, but to make a
model which can be duplicated in any
town or village in the country. :.,

We believe that the Slums and
Tenements and Congested Centers of
population in the Cities are a savagely
deteriorating social, moral and polit-
ical influence, and that a great public
movement should be organized, and
the whole power of the nation and
the states exerted for the betterment
of all the conditions of Rural Life, and
to create and upbuild Centers of So-

Suburban Towns and Villages, where
Trade and Industry can be so firmly
anchored that they cannot be drawn
into the Commercial Maelstrom that
is now steadily sucking Industry and

We believe that every Citizen in

straight from Mother Earth; and that
he has the same right to the Opportun-

enough more to enable him to be a
Homecrofter and to have a Home of
his Own, with ground around it
sufficient to yield him and his family
a Living from the Land as the reward

We believe that the Public Domain
is the most precious heritage of the
people, and the surest safeguard the
nation has against Social Unrest, Dis-
turbance or Upheaval, and that the
Cause of Humanity and the Preserva-

every man who wants a Home on the

We believe that, as a Nation, we
should be less absorbed with Making
Money, and should pay more heed to
raising up and training Men who will
be Law-Abiding Citfeens; that the wel-

centers, the tide has flowed strongly
toward the city and the small town
has had a hard struggle to retain its
own.
In this respect, however, the pendn
lum is swinging back also. .The con
ditlons surrounding the workmen in
the cities, the lack of home life and
the presence of accumulated vice, have
demonstrated to the satisfaction of
every one that we will never reach our
highest Industrial success until the
average workman is placed where he
can have fresh air, a family, and a
home for that family. The small town,
everything else being equal, is the
place for industries. A man with a
home, and who spends his evenings
with bis family beautifying that
home, is not only a better citizen, but
be is worth infinitely more to his em
ployer than his brother laborer who
has no interest other than that he
finds with his saloon companions and

COMPANY
I CHAPTER IX.
Sir Nigel, who had entered the room
ith a silvery-haired old lady upon his
rm, stared aghast at this sudden burst
C candor.
"Maude, Maude!" said he, shaking
is head, "it is more hard for me to
am obedience from you than from the
:nscore drunken archers who followed
le to Gulnne. Yet, hush! little one,
>r your fair lady-mother will be here
non, and there is no need that she
lould know it. We will keep you
■om the provost-marshal this journey,
way to your chamber, sweeting, and
eep a blithe face, for she who con
;sses is shriven. And now, fair moth
r." he continued, when his daughter
ad gone, "sit you here by the fire, for
our blood runs colder than it did.
lleyne Edricson, I •would have a word
ith you, for I would fain that you
lould take service under me. And
ere in good time comes my lady, with
ut whose counsel It is not my wont
> decide aught to import; but, indeed,
was her own thought that you should
jme."
"For I have formed a good opinion
r you, and can see that you are one
hd may be trusted," said the Lady
lOringr. "And in good sooth my dear
)rd hath need of such a one by his
ide, for he recks so little of himself
hat there should be one there to look
o his needs and meet his wants. You
aye seen the cloister; it were well
hat you should see the world, too, ere
ou make choice for life between them."
"You can ride?" asked Sir Nigel,
joking at the youth with puckered
yes.
"Yes, I have ridden much at the ab
ey."
"Yet there is a difference betwixt a
riar's hack and a warrior's destrier,
ou can sing and play?"
"On citole, flute and rebeck."
"Good! You can read blazonry?"
I "Indifferent well."
"I trust that you lie lowly and ser
riceable?"
"I have served all ny life, my lord."
"Canst carve too?'
"I have carved two days a week for
he brethren."
"A model truly! Wilt make a squire
if squires. But toll me, pray, canst
:url hair?"
"No, my lord, but I could learn."
"It is of import," said he. "for I
ove to keep my hair well ordered, see
ng that the weight of my helmet for
hirty years hath In some degree frayed
t upon the top."
"It is for you also to bear the purse,"
aid the lady; "for my sweet lord is of
o free and gracious a temper that he
vould give it gayly to the first who
isked alms ol him. All these things,
vith some knowledge of venerie, and
>f the managament of horse, hawk, and
lound, ■with the grace and hardihood
nd courtesy which are proper to your
ige, will make you a fit squire for Sir
Mgel Loring-"
"Alas, lady!" Alleyne answered, "I
enow well the great honor that you
lave done me in deeming me worthy
o wait upon so renowned a knight,
ret I am so conscious of my own weak
less that I scarce dare incur duties
vhich I might be so ill fitted to fulfil."
"Modesty and a humble mind," said
ihe, "are the very first and rarest gifts
n page or squire. Your words prove
hat you have these, and all the rest
s but the work of use and of time."
"We can scarce hope," said Sir Nigel,
'to have all ready for our start before
he feast of St. Luke, for there is much
obe done in the time. You will have
eisure, therefore. If it please you to
ake service under me, in which to
earn your devoir."
"And I have one favor to crave from
rou," added the lady of the castle, as
Mleyne turned to leave their presence.
"You have, as I understand, much
earning,, which you have acquired at
3eaulieu. I would have you give an
lour or two a day whilst you are with
is in discoursing with my daughter,
he Lady Maude; for she is somewhat
>ackward, I fear, and hath no love for
etters, save for these poor fond ro
mances, which do but fill her empty
lead with dreams of enchanted maid
ens and of errant cavalier. Father
Christopher comes over after nones
from the Priory, but he is stricken with
years and slow of speech, so that she
gets small profit from his teaching. I
would have you do what you can with
her, and with Agatha, my young tire
woman, and with Dorothy Pierpont."
And so Alleyne found himself not
only chosen as squire to a knight, but
also as squire to three damozels, which
was even further from the part which
he had thought to play in the world.
And now there came a time of stir
and bustle, of furbishing of arms and
clang of hammer from all the south
land counties. Fast spread the tidings,
from thorpe to thorpe and from castle
to castle, that the old game was afoot
once more, and the lions and lilies to
be in the field with the early spring.
Great news this for that fierce old
country whose trade for a generation
had been war, her exports archers and
her imports prisoners. For six years
her sons had chafed under an unwonted
peace. Now they flew to their arms as
to their birthright. The old soldiers
of Crecy, of Nogent, and of Poictiers
were glad to think that they might
hear the war-trumpet once more, and
gladder still were the hot youth who
had chaffed for years under the mar
tial tales of their sires. To pierce the
great mountains of the south, to fight
the tamers of the fiery Moors, to fol
low the greatest captain of the age, to
find sunny cornfields and vineyards,
when the marches of Picardy and Nor
mandy were as bare and bleak as the
Jedburgh forests — here was golden
prospects for a race of warriors. From
sea to sea there was stringing of bows
in the cottage and clang of steel in the
castle.
Nor did it take long for every strong
hold to pour forth its cavalry, and
every hamlet its footmen. Through the
late autumn and the early winter every
road and country lane resounded with
nakir and trumpet, with the neigh of
the war-horse and the clatter of march
ing men.
In the ancient and populous county
of Hampshire there was no lack of
leaders or of soldiers for a service
which promised either honor or profit.
Greatest of all the musters, however,
was that at Twynham Castle, for the
name and the fame of Sir Nigel Loring
drew toward him the keenest and bold
est spirits, all eager to serve under so
valiant a leader. Archers from the
New Forest and the Forest of Bere,
blllmen from the pleasant country
which Is watered by the Stour, the
Avon, and the Itchen, young cavaliers
from the ancient Hampshire houses, all
were pushing for Christchurch to take
service under the banner of the five
scarlet roses.
And now, could Sir Nigel have shown
the bachelles of land which the laws
of rank required, he might well have
cut his forked pennon into a square
banner, and taken such a following into
the field as would have supported the
dignity of a banneret. But poverty
was heavy upon him: his land was
scant, his coffers empty, and the very
castle which covered him the holding
of another. Sore was his heart when
he saw rare bowmen and war-hardened
spearmen turned away from his gates
for the lack of the money which might
equip and pay them. Yet the letter
which Aylward had brought him gave
him powers which he was not slow to
use. In it Sir Claude Latour, the Gas
con lieutenant of the White Company,
assured him that there remained in his
keeping enough to fit out a hundred
archers and twenty men-at-arms,
which, joined to the three hundred vet
eran companions already in France,
would make a force which any leader
might be proud to command. Care
fully and sagaciously the veteran
knight chose out his men from the
swarm of volunteers. Many an anxious
consultation he held with Black Simon,
Sam Aylward, and others of his more
experienced followers, as to who should
come and who should stay. By All
Saint's Day, however, he had filled up
his full numbers, and mustered under
his banner as stout a following of
Hampshire foresters as ever twanged
their war-bows. Twenty men-at-arms,
too, well mounted and equipped, formed
the cavalry of the party, while young
Peter Terlake of Fareham, and Walter
Ford of Botley, the martial sons of
martial sires, came at their own cost
to wait upon Sir Nigel and to share
with Alleyne Edricson the duties ot
his squireship.
Tet. even after the enrolment, there
was much to be done ere the party
could proceed upon its way. For ar
mor, swords, and lances there was no
need to take much forethought, for
they were to be had better and cheaper
in Bordeaux than in England. With
the long-bow, however, it was differ
ent. Yew-staves indeed might be got
in. Spain, but it was well to take enough
and to spare with him. Then three
spare cords should be carried for each
bow, with a great store of arrow-heads,
besides the brigandines of chain-mail,
the wadded steel caps, and the bras
sarts or arm-guards, which were the
proper equipment of the archer. Above
all, the women for miles round were
hard at work cutting the white sur
coata which were the badge of tne
company, and adorning them with the
red lion of St. George upon the centre
of the breast. When all ■was completed
and the muster called in the castle
yard, the oldest soldier of the French
wars was fain to confess that he had
never looked upon a better equipped or
more warlike body of -men, from the
knight with his silk jupon, sitting his

huge black bow-stave in the rear. Of,
the six score, fully half had seen ser
vice before, while a fair sprinkling
were men who had followed the wars
all their lives, and had a hand in those
battles which had made the whole
world ring with the fame and the won
der of the English infantry.
Six long weeks were taken in these
preparations, and it was close on Mar
tinmas ere all was ready for a start.
Nigh two months had Alleyne Edric-

son been in Casjle Twynham — months
which were fated to turn the whole
current of his life, to divert it from
that dark and lonely bourne toward
which it tended, and to guide it into
freer and more sunlit channels. Al
ready he had learned to bless his father
for that wise provision which had made
him seek to know the world ere he had
ventured to renounce it.
For it was a different place from
that ■which he had pictured — very dif
ferent from that which he had heard
described when the master of the nov
ices held forth to his charges upon tne
ravening wolves who lurked for them
beyond the peaceful folds of Beaulieu
There was cruelty in it, doubtless, and
lust and sin and sorrow; but were there
not virtues to atone, robust, positive
virtues, which did not shrink from
temptation, which held their own in all
the rough blasts of the workaday
world? How colorless by contrast ap
peared the sinlessness which came from
inability to sin. the conquest which
was attained by flying from the enemy!
Abbot Berghersh was a good man, but
how was he better than this kindly
knight, who lived as simple a life,
held as lofty and inflexible an ideal of
whatever came to his hand to do? In
turning from the service of the one to
that of the other, Alleyne coulj not feel
that he was lowering his aims in life.
Henceforth for seven hours a day he
strove in the tilt-ynrd to qualify hi-v
s"lf to be a worthy squire to so worthy
a knight. Young, supple. an<l active
with all the pent energies from years
of pure and healthy living, it was not
long before he could manage his horse
and his weapon well ennusrh to earn
an approving nod from critical men-at
nrms, or to hold his own aratast Ter-
InUe and Ford, his fellow-squires.
But were there no other r>nnc-M°»"i-
Hnns Which swayed hi"i from the
cloisters toward the world? Here, day

Ml therefore doubly dane-erous from

'hat in their presence he was conscious
of a quick sympathy, a pleasant pasp a
ready response to all that was most
~"ntle and best in himself, which filler!
his sou! with a vague and new-found
loy.
And yet the Lady Maude Lortntr wa=
no easy punil to handlp. An older and
more world-wisp man mie-ht hnve been
nuzzled hv her varying moods, her sud
den prejudices, her quick resentrnnnt
of all constraints and authorltv. TMd a
subiect intprest hpr. was there space
in it for eithpr romance or imagina
tion, she would fly throucrh It with he*
subtlp active mind, leaving her two fel
low-students and even her teacher toil
ing behind her. On thp other hand
were there dull patience needpd with
stpadv toil and strain of mpmory, no
single fact could, by any driving, bp
fixed in her mind. Allevne might talk
to her of the stories of old gods and
[ heroes, of gallant deeds and lofty aims,
| or he might hold forth upon moon and
stars, and let his fancy wander over
the hidden secrets of the universe, and
he would have a rapt listener with
flushed cheeks and eloquent eyes, who
could repeat after him the very words
which had fallen from his lips. But
when it came to almagest and astrol
able, the counting of figures and reck
oning of epicycles, away would go her
thoughts to horse and hound, and a va
cant eye and listless face would warn
the teacher that he had lost his hold
upon his scholar. Then he had but tc
bring out the old romance-book from
the Priory, with beflngered cover of
fheepskin and gold letters upon a pur
ple ground to entice her wayward
mind back to the paths of learning.
At times, too, when the wild fit was
upon her, she would break into pert
ness and rebel openly against Alleyne's
R-entle firmness. Yet he would jog
quietly on with his teachings, takins
no heed to her mutiny, until suddenly
she would be conquered by his patience,
and break into self-revilings a hun
dred times stronger than her fault de
manded. It chanced, however, that, on
one of these mornings when the evil
mood was upon her. Agatha, the young
tire-woman, thinking to please her mis
tress, began also to toss her head and
make tart rejoinder to the teacher's
questions. In an Instant the Lndv
Maude had turned upon her two blaz
ing eyes and a face which was blanched
with anger.
"You would dare!" said she. "You
would dare!"
The frightened tire-woman tried to
excuse herself. "But, my fair lady,'
she stammered, "what have I done? I
have said no more than I heard."
"You would dare!" repeated the lady,
in a choking voice. "You, a graceless
baggage, a foolish lack-brain, with no
thought above the hemming of shifts!
And he so kindly and hendy and lone
suffering! You would — ha, you may
well flee the room!"
She had spoken with a rising voice.
and a clasping and opening of her lonT
white fingers, so that It was no marvel
that, ere the speech was over, the
skirts of Agatha were whisking round
the door and the click of her sobs to he
heard dying swiftly away down the
corridor.
AHeyne stared open-eyed at this
tigress who had sprung so suddenly to
his rescue. "There is no need for such
anger," he said mildly. "The maid's
w words have done me no scath. It is
y you yourself who have erred."
" I know it," she cried; "I am a most
w wicked woman. But it is bad enougn
t that one should misuse you. I will see
t that there is not a second one."
" "Nay, nay, no one has misused me,"
h he answered. "But the fault lies in
y your hot and bitter words. You have
c called her a baggage and. a lack-brain,
a and I know not what."
" "And you are he who taught mo *«*
s speak the truth!" she cried. "Now I
h have spoken it, and yet I cannot please
. .-ou. Lack-brain she is, and lack-brain
I shall call her."
S Such was a sample of the sudden
l langlings which marred the peace of
t that little class. And yet, there were
t times when Alleyne had to ask himself
w whether it was not the Lady Maude
. ..■ho was gaining sway and influence
o over him. If she were changing, so
v v.as he. In vain he strove and reasoned
w with himself as to the madness of let-
t ting his mind rest upon Sir Nigel's
'"uphtor. Stronger than reason, strong-
e er than cloister teachings, stronger
''an all that might hold him back, was
t that old, old tyrant who will brook no
r rival in the kingdom of youth.
H He had scarce dared to face the
c change which had come upon him, when
a a few sudden chnnce words showed it

other continued, "from Pareham Creek
to the slope of the Portsdown Hill,
.^ure am 1 that Sir Nigel would be
ulithe at such a match."
"But how the lady?" asked Alleyne,
with dry lips.
"Ah, lad! there lies my trouble. It is
a toss of the head and a droop of the
eyes if 1 say one word of what is in my
iiiind. I did but ask her yester-night
lor her green veil, that I might bear
it as a token or lambrequin upon my
helm; but she flashed out at me that
she kept it for a better man, and then
all in a breath asked pardon for that
she had spoke so rudely. Yet she
would not take back the words either,
nor would she grant the veil. iiua
it seemed to thee, Alleyne, that she
loves any one?"
"Nay, I cannot say," said Alleyne,
with a wild lurob oi sudden iiupe in
his heart.
"I have thought so, and yet I can
not name the man. indeed, save my
self, and Walter Ford, and you, who
are half a clerk, and Father Christo
pher of the Priory, and Bertrand the
page, who is there whom she sees?"
"I cannot tell," quoth Alleyne shortly;
and the two squires rode on a gain,
each intent upon his own thoughts.
Next day at morning lesson the
teacher observed that his pupil was
indeed looking pale and jaded, with
listless eyes and a weary manner. He
was heavy-hearted to note the change
in her.
"Your mistress, I fear, is ill, Agatha,"
he said to the tire-woman, when the
Lady Maude had sought her chamber.
The maid looker aslant at him with
laughing eyes. "It is not an illness
that kills," quoth she.
"Pray God not!" he cried. "But tell
me, Agatha, what is it that ails her?"
"Me thinks that I could lay my hand
upon another who is smitten with the
same trouble," said she, with the same
sidelong look. "Canst not give a name
to it, and thou so skilled in leechcraft?"
"Nay, save that she seems aweary."
"Well, bethink you that it is but
three days ere you will be gone, and
Castle Twynham be as dull as the
priory. Is there not enough there to
cloud a lady's brow?"
"In sooth, yes," he answered. "I
had forgot that she is about to lose
her father."
"Her father!" cried the tire-woman,
with a little trill of laughter. "Oh,
simple, simple!" And she was off down
the passage like arrow from bow, while
Alleyne stood gazing after her, be
twixt hope and doubt, scarce daring
to put faith in the meaning ■which
seemed to underlie her words.
CHAPTER X.
St. Luke's day had come and had
gone, and it was in the season of
Martijimas, that the White Company
irr.B ready for its journey. Loud
shrieked the brazen bugles from keep
and from gate-way, and merry was
the rattle of the war-drum, as the men
pathered in the outer bailey, with
torches to light them, for the morn
had not yet broken. Alleyne, from the
window of the armory, looked down
upon the strange seene — the circles of
yellow flickering light, the lines of
stern and bearded faces, the quick
rhimmer of arms, and the lean heads
of the horses. In front stood th bow
men, ten deep, with a fringe of under
ofßcers, who paced hither and thither,
marshalling the ranks with curt pre
cept or sharp rebuke. Behind were
the little clump of steel-clad horse
men, their lances raised, with long
rensils drooping down the oaken shafts
So silent and still were they that they
might have been metal-sheethed stat
ues, were it not for the occasional quick
impatient stamp of their chargers, or
the rattle of chamfron against neck
plates as they tossed and strained.
A spear's length in front of them sat
the spare and long-limbed figure of
Black Simon, the Norwich fighting man,
his fierce, deep lined face framed in
steel and the silk guidon, marked ■with
the five scarlet roses, slanting over
his broad right shoulder.
The young squire was leaning for
ward gazing at the stirring and martial
scene, when he heard a short quick
gasp at his shoulder, and there ■was
the Lady Maude with her hand to her
heart, leaning up against the wall,
slender and fair, like a half-plucked
lily. Her face was turned away from
him, but he could see, by the sharp
intake of her breath, that she was
weeping bitterly.
"Alas! alas!" he cried, all unnerved
at the sight, "why is it that you are
so sad, lady?"
"It is the sight of these brave men,"
she answered; "and to think how many
of them go and how few are like to
find their way back. I have seen it
before, when I was a little maid, in
the year of the Prince's great battle
I remember then how they mustered
in the bailey, even as they do now.
nnd my lady-mother holding me in
her arms at this very window that I
might see the show."
"Please God, you will see them all
bark ere another year be out," said he
She shook her head, looking round
at him with flushed cheeks and eyes
which sparkled in the lamp-light. "Oh,
but I hate myself for being a woman!"
she cried, with a stamp of her little
loot. "What can I do that is good?
Here I must bide and talk and sew
and spin, and spin and sew and talk
Ever the same dull round, with nothing
at the end of it. And now you are
going. too, who could carry my
thoughts out of these gray walls, and
raise my mind above tapestry and
distaffs. What can I do? I am of no
more use or value than that broken
bow-stave."
"Ton are of such value to me," he
cried, in a whirl of hot. passionate
words, "that all else has become
naught. Tou are my heart, my life.
my one and only thought. Oh. Maude
T "cannot live without you! I cannot
leave you without a word of love. All

nnworthv: but if great love may weigh
down such defects, then mine may do
it. Give me but one word of hope to
tnke to the wars with me, but one.
Ah you shrink, you shudder! My wild
words have frightened you."
Twice she opened her lips, and twice
no sound came from them. At last
she spoke in a hard and measured voice,
as one who dare not trust herself to
speak too freely.
"This is over-sudden," she said: "It is
not so long since, the world was
nothing to you. You have changed
o once; perchance you may change
a again."
" "Cruel!" he cried. "Who hath
c changed me?"
" "And then your brother!" she con
ttinued with a little laugh, disregard
iing his question. "Methinks this hath
b become a family custom amongst the-
E Edricsons. Nay, lam sorry; I did not

" "Say some word of hope, however

" "Nay, Alleyne, it were a cruel kind-

c closer link between us. It is madness

 He J. ?x yes s °ftened upon him, and a
heartfelt answer was on her lips,
when a hoarse shout, with the clatter
of arms and stamping of steeds rose
up from the bailey below. At the
sound her face set, her eyes sparkled
and she stood with flushed cheek and
head thrown back — a woman's body,
but a soul of fire.
."My .father hath gone down," she
cried. Your place is by his side. Nay,
look not at me, Alleyne. It is no
time for dallying. win my father's
love, and all may follow. It Is when
the brave soldier hath done his devoir
that he hopes for his reward. Fare
well, and may God be with you!" She
heldout her white, slim hand to him,
but as he bent his lips over it she
whisked away and was gone, leaving
in his outstretched hand the very
green veil for which Peter Terlake
had craved in vain. Again the hoarse
cheering burst out from below, and he
heard the clang of the rising portcul
lis. Pressing the veil to his lips, he
thrust it into the bosom of his tunic
and rushed as fast as feet could bear
him to arm himself and join the muster.
The raw morning had broken ere
the hot spiced ale was served round
and last farewell spoken. First came
Black Simon with his banner, bestrid
ing a lean and powerful dapple-gray
charger) as hard and wiry as himself.
After him, riding three abreast, were
nine men-at-arms, all picked soldiers,
who had followed the French wars
before. So, with jingle of arms and
clatter of hoofs, they rode across the
Bridge of Avon, while the burghers
shouted for the flag of the five roses
and its gallant guard.
Close at the heels of the horses came
two-score archers, burly and mostly
bearded, their round targets on their
backs and their long yellow bows, the
most deadly weapon that the wit of
man had yet devised, thrusting forth
from behind their shoulders. From
each man's girdle hung sword or axe,
according to his humor, and over his
rig Tit hip there jutted out Xhe leathern
quiver, with its bristle of gooseT' pigeon
and peacock feathers.
So we'll toast altogether
To the Gray Goose Feather,
And the land where the Gray Goose
flew.
Behind the bowmen strode two
trumpeters blowing upon nakirs, and
two drummers in parti-colored clothes.
After them came twenty-seven sump
ter-horses carrying tent poles, cloth,
spare arms, spurs, wedges, cooking
kettles, horseshoes, bags of nails, and
the hundred other things which ex
perience had shown to be needful In a
harried hostile country. A white mule
with red trappings, led by a varlet,
carried Sir Nigel's own napery and
table comforts. Then came two-score
more archers, ten more men-at-arms,
and, finallly a rear-guard of twenty
bowmen, with big John towering in
the front rank and the veteran Aylward
marching by his side, his battered har
ness and faded surcoat in strange con
trast with the snow-white jupons and
shining brigandines of his companions.
A quick cross-fire of greetings and
questions and rough West Saxon Jests
flew from rank to rank, or ■were bandied
about betwixt the marching archers
and the gazing crowd.
The Company haa marchea to the
turn of the road ere Sir Nigel Loring
rode out from the gate-way, mounted
on Pommers, his great black war
war-horse, whose ponderous footfall
on the wooden drawbridge echoed
loudly from the gloomy arch which
spanned it. Sir Nigel was still in his
velvet dress of peace, with flat velvet
cap of maintenance, and curling ostrich
feather clasped in a golden brooch.
He bore no arms save the long and

palfrey at her lord's bridle-arm, for
she would see him as far as the edge
of the forest, and ever and anon she
turned her hardlined face up wistfully
to him and ran a questioning eye over
his apparel and appointments.
"I trust that there is nothing forgot,"
she said, beckoning to Alleyne to ride
on her farther side. "I trust him to

"My sweet bird," said Sir Nigel, "I
am right loath to part, but we are
now at the fringe of the forest, and
it is not right that I should take the
chatelaine too far from her trust."
"But, oh, my dear lord," she cried,
with a trembling lip, "let me bide
with you for one furlong further — or
one and a half, perhaps. You may
spare me this out of the weary milea
that you will journey alone."
"Come then, my heart's comfort," be
answered. "But I must crave a gage
from thee. It is my custom, darling,
and hath been since I have first known
thee, to proclaim by herald in such
camps, townships, or fortalices as I

sweetest in Christendom, I should
deem it great honor and kindly conde

three courses against me with shar

a lady whose claim he was willing
to advance. I p*ay you then, my fair
dove, that you will vouchsafe to me
one of those doe-skin gloves, that I
may wear it as the badge of her whose
servant I shall ever be."
"Alack and alas for the fairest and
sweetest!" she cried. "Fair and sweet
I would fain be for your dear sake, my
lord, but old I am and ugly, and the
knights would laugh should you lay
lance In rest in such a cause."
"Edricson," quoth Sir Nigel, "you
have young eyes, and mine are some

to see a knight laugh, or smile, or
even look,, arch his brows, or purse
his mouth, or in any way show sur
prise that I should uphold the Lady
Mary, you will take particular note
pf his name, his coat-armor, and his
lodging. Your love, my life's desire!"
The Lady Mary Loring slipped her
hand from her yellow leather gauntlet,
and he, lifting it with dainty rever
ence, bound it to the front of his velvet
cap.
"It is with mine other guardian
angels," quoth he, pointing at the
oaints medals which hung beside it.
And now, my dearest, you have come
far enough. May the Virgin guard and
prosper thee! One kiss!" he bent down
from his saddle, and then, striking
spu"rs into his horse's sides, he galloped
at top speed after his men, with his
three squires at his heels. Half a mile
further, where the road topped a hill,
they looked back, and the Lady Mary,
on her white palfrey, was still where
they had left her. A moment later they
were on the downward slope, and she
had vanished from their view.

Tomatoes For the Cannery.',
Raising tomatoes for the canneries
has grown to be quite an industry in
a number of States. Maryland leads
the list with about two million cases
per annum; Indiana, with her million
cases, second; followed, in turn, by
New Jersey, California, Delaware and
Ohio. The canneries are permanent
institutions, the demand is increasing,
and there is no reason why the grow
ing of tomatoes will not continue to be
a profitable business with many.
Growing tomatoes for a cannery dif
fers from raising them for the market.
In the former case, first of all, a large
yield is sought. Early maturity is of
less importance since the grower con
tracts to sell the whole crop nt a fixed
price. It is said that good corn land
Is rich enough for tomatoes, although
medium clay loam is preferred by
many.
Splendid results follow fall or winter
plowing. At any rate land should be
plowed as early in the spring as pos
sible. Plow deep and follow with
earth mulching, that is, maintain a
thin layer of fine earth on the surface
by shallow cultivation^ which will be
of great value in saving the moisture.
The variety should be such as the
canneries prefer. They will generally
provide the plants at a nominal price
to those who grow tomatoes for them.
In case it is preferred to grow the
plants near where they are to be set,
they should be started in a cold frame
or on the south side of a board fence
In a rich warm soil. The plants will
increase to proper size in four or five
weeks, and should be set out in the
field in rows about four feet apart, for
ease of cultivation. Start the cultiva
tion early, but be careful not to bark
the plants, as that will kill them.
When they begin to branch do not
cultivate closer than the ends of t\ -
branches. Continue stirring the soil
GROWN IN THE GOOD OLD-FASHIONED WAT.
nntil the stalk has grown so heavy as
to fall upon the ground, then cease.
For heavy yields it is essential that
strong land or heavy fertilization be
used. While it is true that on many
of the soils in the Middle States a re
munerative crop may be produced with
little fertilization, it is also true that
on nearly all of these soils a liberal
use of fertilizers will be profitable.
The tomato plant is a gross feeder,
and especially requires an abundant
supply of potash. Trof. Voorhees, of
New Jersey, who is authority on such
subjects, estimates that ten tons of
fruit, with the accompanying vines,
■would contain fifty-seven pounus of
nitrogen, sixteen pounds of phosphoric
acid, and ninety-four pounds of potash.
On many of our clay lands phosphoric
add is relatively low, and the applica
tion of potash is needc - to prc.uce the
most profitable crops. The nitrogen
supply Is more variable, and can often
be secured by turning under a legumi
nous crop. On Eastern lands, which
have been devoted to last year's toma
toes, nitrate of soda can be used with
a profit. In the Central States, manu
facturers of fertilizers have not offered
goods specially prepared for this vege
table because of a lack of demand, due
largely to the ignorance of same, and
from lack of knowledge of the require
ments of the soil. But of late both the
growers and the canners are asking for
advice regarding fertilizers to be used
on tomatoes. A mixture that has been
officially recommended contains:
Nitrogen 4 per cent.
Phosphoric acid. . . 7 per cent.
Potash 12 per cent
using about 500 pounds of this mixture
per acre.
Some experiments of early tomatoes
seem to indicate that sulphate of
potash gives them a better quality.
A properly made tobacco fertilizer is
also suited for this crop, and the
potash in it is derived from sulphate.

GUY ELLIOTT MITCHELL
A New Potato Culture.
A queer tale In agriculture comes by
way of Chicago. It is stated that a
half-bushel of sawdust, a dash of
chemical solution and fifteen potatoes
carefully enveloped with the sawdust
will enable the average householder to
grow a bushel of tubers on his house
top or in his cellar within sixty days.
This process has been discovered and
elaborated by W. D. Darst, of Great
Falls, Mont Moreover, the grower
will have no potato bugs to contend
with, no turning over of the soil at
certain intervals, and no contest with
worms.
'..'ae product of Mr Darst's process
is termed the "vineless potato" from
the fact that, grown under these ap
parently unnatural conditions, there is
no surface vegetation, because of
which, each potato buried in the saw
dust is enabled to produce at least
twelve normal-sized tubers.
Recently at the Oakland Plaza, la
the rear of the Oakland Hotel, Mr.
Darst disclosed the methods of grow
ing potatoes by his system. Operating
on the theory that the presence of sur
face vegetation was only a method of
securing nourishment and in reality
sapped the vitality of the tuber, Mr.
Darst experimented more than six
years and found he could overcome
this seemingly natural course on the
part of the plant by supplying it arti
ficially with its needs.
By employing sawdust, peat, straw,
or any other earth product that would
permit of the circulation of air, moist
ure and heat, and by applying solutions
of various fertilizers, discovered
that a single potato would multiply
itself by attaching to itself from
twelve to sixteen other potatoes of
approximately the same dimensions
without throwing off any of its energy
above ground.
Packed in loosely arranged bins per
mitting the free access of air and ar
ranged in rows six inches above each
other, with an allowance of one cubic
foot of sawdust to the seedling, Mr.
Darst has demonstrated the rapidity
of growth and the proportions that the
potatoes may attain by showing th.;t
within sixty days fifteen potatoes will
produce a bushel. In the character of
his experiments and the success that
has attended them Mr. Darst, it is
stated, has the indorsement of Luther
Burbank, the eminent horticulturist
and botanist. — From Chicago Record
Herald.
Counterfeit Blossoms.
When the dogwood is in bloom in
the spring woods, he would be a very
unobservant traveler who did not
know it; yet it is questionable if one
out of fifty of the multitude of people
who come home from their country
walks with their arms full of snowy
branches has ever noticed the real
flowers of this beautiful tree, a
matter of fact, what are commonly re
garded as the petals of the dogwood
are no part of the floral structure at
all, but merely four large white leaves,
which, during the winter, served as
protective wrappers to the flower buds.
The real flowe:s are about the size of
shoe-pegs, of greenish color and are
bunched several together in a small
cluster in the midst of the four white
leaves, and if observed at all by the
average wild flower gatherers, are
iiistaken for stamens.
So, too. with the flowers of the
pretty "painted cup," which when it
blossoms in May frequently makes
whole meadows rosy with brilliant
color. Plucking one, we may think we
are looking at a pike of gorgeous,
flame-colored flowers, while the fact
is that the striking effect is produced
entirely by numerous reddened leaves
intermingled with the real flowers
which are as plain as Cindere s
sisters and practically hidden from
sight.
Indeed, so fond is Mother Nature of
befooling her unobservant devotees
that she has caused one whole family
of plants to be given over to this make
believe habit of flowering. To it be
long that favorite little preacher of the

muddy margins of shallow streams;
the skunk cabbage, and that aristo
crat of the greenhouse, the Immacu
late calla lily. With all these the
flowers are unrecognizable in them
selves as such, except by the initiated,
being minute and crowded on a fleshy
spike.
Another pay deceiver is the poin

Is a circlet of scarlet leaves which
popular estimation rates as a flower,
while the poor little real blossom
clustered in the midst of these robbers
of their good name live and die unap

are the wild spurges of our sandy
fields.. The flowers of many of these,
inconspicuous in themselves, are sim
ilarly provided with relatively showy
appendages, deceiving all but studentr.
The Department of Agriculture has
recently published a bulletin coutaiu
lng suggestions for constructing a
model dairy barn. It has been the
endeavor of the Department to plan

that cm consistent w.l.i practicability
and cheapness, and it is believed the
rt;.;ult accomplished by the plan pub
lished will help the dairyman to get
the best products from his cows In the
most economical manner.
The plan is designed for 24 cows,
nnd allows ample room for calf pens
and box stalls for bull and cows; also

room and silo. In presenting the plan

Important features often overlooked
by the builder and which are vita!
to a well-planned structure.
The amount of space allowed for
the various purposes named on the
plan is thought to meet the require
ments so far as the square feet of
floor space is concerned. The ar
rangement of the space can be adapted
to the needs of the particular location.
The design calls for a width of 36

stalls and passageways, and, second,
It permits of the most economical use
of lumber in building. The lengtn
shown is 84 feet, but this feature is
wholly dependent on the number of
cows the dairyman wishes to handle.
One of the weakest joints in barn con
struction is the small amount of win
dow space usually allowed. This error
is rectified by the Department in this
plan by allowing approximately 6
square feet for each cow.

Era
We are inclined to believe that some magazine writers in their anxiety te
attract attention to themselves have overstated the case against the meat packers.
We do not sell meat but believe in fair play, and also in a complete knowledge,
by the people, of exactly what they are eating.
We have always printed on each and every pkg. of

Food
exactly what it is made of and the scores of visitors who pass through our works
every day find the Pure Food Factories as clean and sweet as a maiden's fresh white
apron. The food is thoroughly cooked in these factories from the choicest white
wheat and barley, the sweet offering of the fields.
No food on earth gives the same sustaining
power from meal to meal as Grape -Nuts»
BECAUSE—
The starchy parts of the wheat and barley are changed by moisture and heat
to a form of sugar required by the human system and almost immediately absorbed
without stress to the digestive machinery. And again, the certain elements in these
grains are incorporated to insure rebuilding of the soft gray matter in the brain and
nerve centres to fit one for the wearing work of the day. A dish of Grape-Nuts and
Cream at each meal supplies the GO and you can feel it in a way that leaves no
question. It is not stimulation but simply scientific feeding.
