SIBERIA IN WINTER.
ARCTIC COLD AND ICINESS REIGN
FOR FOUR MONTHS.
Vladivostok Then Is Frozen Stiff, a
World of Black and Deadly Frost.
The Way Frozen Food Is Displayed
In the Bazaar— Coast Sledge Racine
Imagine a black world frozen stiff,
and that Is Vladivostok in winter.
Wherever water once flowed, In bay
or harbor, a wide, gray white road now
runs, and these are the only two colors
in a wide, still world. There are no
trees. The large forests of which the
old travelers wrote have long since
been cut down for fuel, and the im
mediate hills behind the town are all
as bare as a man's hand. Once behind
these hills the endless rolling plain be
gins, which is Siberia, says Herbage
Edwards in London Black and White.
Directly summer is over all the
wealth of flowers which for five short
months have simply rioted in the land
go black, die out The earth freezes
stiff. Winter has come, and black and
stiff the world remains. In Vladivostok
there is HtUe snow. Sometimes a gray
dust, more like powdered ice than
snow, blows over the land, but for the
most part it is a black, not -a white,
world of frost, and in its way it is
more impressive. The earth freezes
deep many feet down and is as hard as
iron. The whole harbor turns a kind
of dull gray. That, too, is frozen deep.
To keep any sort of channel open the
powerful Ice breaker has to go through
its work twice a day. Twelve hours of
an ordinary winter's day is often suffi
cient to block the passage. And all
this in a town in the same parallel as
Marseilles.
To those who have never experi
enced it real arctic cold is almost in
conceivable. They cannot grasp the
difference between 10 and 50 degrees
of frost It remains to them merely
one of numbers. Indeed when once
the winter has gone it Is sometimes
difficult to remember really how cold
It was, but during the four severe win
ter months themselves it Is a very
solid and . serious fact. Every night
you go to sleep remembering, if you
are new to such things, that a failure
°of the furnace which heats the house
means death. You might wake first to
know you were frozen or you might
not. In the poorer houses the inhabit
ants sleep on the stoves, and the weak
ones often die. Drunkenness here is
often attended with a swift retribu
tion, which does not in the least pre
vent it, and every day in win«-"r people
are taken up frozen from the gutters,
the spirit which is in them only has
tening the freezing, so that the carts
which are always sent round to pick
up the sailors when the crews of the
men-of-war are ashore have to do their
work quickly. In the summer time,
when there Is not the same need for
hurry, the men often He about In gut
ters until the afternoon. The .word
"gutters"ls used simply to designate a
certain part of the roadway. Gutters
as such do not exist. The drunken
ness among all classes of Russians is
simply appalling. Officers think noth
ing of taking a tumblerful of raw
whisky as a modest "bitters" before
dinner. X. r \
When the wind is not blowing the
cold Is endurable, though five' fur lined
overcoats are not at all nn extraordi
nary amount of winter wrap. You
wear, of course, fur boots, fur gloves,
fur caps. Women have their skirts
and bodices lined with fur. Wildcat,
being both soft and very warm, is of
ten used for this purpose. It Is quite
astonishing the partiality for such
things as oily sardines that one devel
ops. ,
In the winter time the bazaar Is real
ly a sight. Everything Is frozen stiff.
The huge, long sturgeons from the in
terior stand In rows on their very sharp
pointed noses. Baskets full of Ilttie
fishes are plied together like chips of
Ice. Frozen birds hang down on long
festoons, and the municipality is spar
ed one trouble— it never has to make
away with food "gone bad." The
bazaar is almost entirely in the bands
of the Chinese, the tall, dark, rough
Chinese of the north, who live wrapped
up In wadded cotton clothes until they
look like bundles of bedding. Without
the Chinese and the Japanese Vladivos
tok would find it hard to exist. They
do all the work of the town. The
Russians garrison and govern It. The
Chinese, the Germans, the Japanese
and the other nations trade in it
The great sport of Vladivostok in the
winter is sledge racing, and when once
jibe harbor Is frozen over a proper
course Is marked off, and every one
who owns a horse takes part. A Rus
sian horse is a superior brute. He
stands as high and looks as strong as
a cart horse, but he goes like the wind,
fie will walk or he will gallop, but he
does not condescend to do anything be
tween. His harness Is weird and won
derful and very Russian, consisting
prlnjarlly of a huge wocden half hoop
jpver the head, the keystone of the
jwholo structure, which Is attached to
JnS shafts by winding long, thin straps
jba'ckwnrd and forward. It takes hours
to put this on, is always liable to come
undone and If undone Is very danger
o'Mp. An English lady once related to
me whti horror how she was taken
7or. a drive in Vladivostok and the
hQrse and carriage Just went over ev
?isßilng— walls, banks or whatever
"cafh<s iA the way. It is quite true, a
'Hu.s.slaii horse does, and if you have
ohod driven behind one you are never
gfitfolia again. You are either killed
I In Vladivostok you take your daily
skate" as your constitutional, and the
'most exciting thing to do Is to sledge
K.lQng the coast— dangerous because
Id&SS ice Is never quite trustworthy—
So "^skold, which is an Island on the
pcfttheaat coast of Siberia.

THE 'WIND'S MYSTERY.
Mountain and Valley BrceiH and
How They Originate.
The meteorologist is gradually di
vesting the wind of Its mystery and is
able to explain convincingly how and
when It originates. The study of a
great number of observations taken si
multaneously all over the country and,
in fact, all over two continents has en
abled the expert to foresee Just when
wind and storm will arrive at certain
sections of the country.
Of course the physical topography ol
any neighborhood lias Its Influence on
the local storms, fogs and prevailing
winds. The "mountain" and "valley
breezes" that are so eagerly sought
during the summer recreation or so
journ is an instance of the effect ol
mountains on local climate and weath
er conditions. As explained by a pro
fessor of meteorology; because of ac
tive radiation at. night the- layers 6l
air near the earth become cooled, and
as cool air Is heavier. than warm air,
a law of physics that Is generally ap
preciated theoretically, but usually
overlooked practically, this heavy ail
tends to move down the hillside. The
tendency becomes after a time suffi
ciently pronounced to produce a gen
eral downhill movement, eventually re
sulting In a perceptible breeze.
That is what is commonly designated
locally as "the mountain breeze", and
which, from its origin. Is practically in
one constant direction, though the in
tervention of powerful storms may
temporarily reverse the customary
movement. Vice versa, during the day
the presence of warmer and therefore
lighter air near the earth causes a
movement of the atmosphere .with an
upward tendency, creating the so call
ed valley breezes. In certain favora
bly situated localities the appearance
of the mountain or the valley breeze
Is as regular as clockwork, the transi
tional period being marked by a calm.

BEAVERS IN MONTANA.
The Rare Animal Is Very Tame
Where He Is Not Hnntril.
The beaver is not shy where he is not
hunted and acquires confidence in a
friendly watcher sooner than any oth
er animal 1 know. Strangers or unusu
al clothes on a person to whom they
have become nccustomed alarm thorn,
though, like dogs, they can apparently
Identify an acquaintance by scent.
The beaver's sense of sineil is very
acute, for he is able to scent a man
200 yards away, and liis eyesight is
also most keen, but be seems to be dull
of hearing when at work, and I have
often walked to within a few feet of
one while he was cutting wood. How
ever, their method of warning each
other of danger Is by slapping or
"smothering" the water with the long,
flat tail which is so characteristic a
feature of the animal and which not
only helps him in swimming, but is
used for carrying mud. If a large ani
mal appears at a place where beavers
want to work or feed the latter will
often "smother" the water continually,
one after another Joining in, till the In
truder Is scared away. I have had a
thorough wetting at night while watch
ing a pond through the splashing made
by this trick.
I saw my first beavers in the Mussel
shell river in Montana. At first they
dived whenever they became aware of
my presence, but after about three
months they paid no attention when
they scented me, and in six months
they would swim around or cut bushes
within a few feet of me. In fact, they
repeatedly stole my fishing poles cut
from green willows until I teamed to
use dry ones.— Country Life In Amer
ica.
No Chance of Confnalon There.
"The trouble with our people," ex
claimed the popular orator, "is that
they too often confuse license with lib
erty."
"I don't know about other kinds of
license," interrupted a thoughtful look
ing man from the audience, "but I can
state emphatically that there is no con
fusion between a marriage license and
liberty."
There were approving murmurs clear
back to the rear of the hall.— New Or

When work is hard and

"OYSTER FARMS.
The Katnral and Artificial Beda la
Eastern Virginia.
. ; In eastern Tlrglnla there are several
thousand acres of oyster farms where
oysters are raised by artificial methods
on artificial beds. The natural oyster
i bed Is where the oyster breeds and
.matures naturally. There are thou
sands of acres of such beds ln the
! Chesapeake b»y system of salt water.
In such beds the oysters breed by the
millions, and as they are too close to
gether there they cannot all reach a
satisfactory growth. If taken . when
small from . these natural beds and
strewn along on the bottoms where
there are no oysters naturally, at the
.rate of 000 to 1,000 bushels per acre,
; such young oysters mature and ripen
off for the market, some ln one and
the rest in two years.
There Is a profit ln such work. when
.intelligently managed of 25 to 33% pei
cent. Probably more than 100,000 acres
of artificial oyster bed? are made to
grow an oyster crop ln addition to the
acreage embraced ln the natural beds.
The area of artificial beds Is Increas
ing rapidly each year.
One singular feature about the oys
ter Is this: They all look exactly alike,
there being no difference between the
male and the female externally or In
ternally. In fact, the art of man is not
sufficient to distinguish one sex from
another. Another unique feature Is
this: The male oyster 'lays" as many
eggs as the female— "equal rights." we
perceive. The eggs of the r|ale are
called milt, and the eggs of the fe
male are called spawn. An ordinary
full grown oyster is supposed to lay a
million eggs a year. In spawning sea
son the water is full of these eggs,
and when the milt and the spawn
come in contact and the water is at the
right temperature life is Imparted to
the microscopic egg, and it drops to
the bottom, where. If it succeeds in
grasping hold of something, such as
another oyster or shell or rock or any
thing to hang on to, the tiny creature
begins to form its shell and in a few
weeks becomes visible to the eye.—
Country Gentleman.
AN ELEPHANT TRAIT.
The Animal While Busy -Will Never
Injure a Person.
"An elephant never injures a person
when it is busy," says an animal train
er with a big circus. "It may sound
strange, but there is not a case on rec
ord of one getting ugly when it was
performing or working. The reason, I
think, is that the elephant Is an animal
of one Idea— that is, It can think of
only one thing at a time. '
"When you put an elephant at work
it gives its whole attention to Its task.
Great power of concentration? No,
just inability to think of two things at
once. When It gets busy it takes a lot
to distract. Its attention, and it never
stops to think about a private griev
ance. If we start a horse or a dog do-
Ing a trick we can't leave it for a min
ute or it will loaf or stop work alto
gether, but it is different with an ele
phant. Once get it started, either alone
or with others, and It will go through
with Its turn without another word.
It is absorbed ln its work.
"That same trait, I take it. Is what
makes an elephant such a vicious ani
mal when It gets ugly. It can think of
nothing but what has made It angry,
and it will not stop until it has torn
something to pieces. Oh, yes, an ele
phant can carry a grudge. It never for
gets an Injury, and it waits Its chance
to get even, but when It is busy it for
gets the tricks that have, been played
on it. It is only when it has nothing
to do that It gets to brooding over its
troubles. Human, eh? Well, I have
known folk with that sort of disposi
tion."
Leap Year Proposals.
The origin of the peculiar woman's
right of leap year is said to date back
to the fifth century. St Bridget, so the
story goes, was troubled because the
women under her charge insisted on
their right of proposing to the men.
Accordingly she went to St. Patrick
and begged him to settle the matter by
fixing certain seasons In which women
might take the Initiative. St. Patrick
promised them every seventh year, but
then, pleased by the persuasive elo
quence of St. Bridget, he said they
should have the longest year in the
calendar, and that was every fourth
year, when February had an extra day.
So long.
* With respect to the origin of the fa
miliar parting salute, "So long,'.' there
Is a suggestion that it is derived from
the Norwegian "Saa laenge," a com
mon form of farewell, equivalent in
meaning to "au revolr," nnd pronounc
ed like "so long," with the "g" soften
ed. There was a fair number of Nor
wegians among the settlers in Ameri
ca, to Judge by names, and it is quite
likely the phrase was picked up from
them. It is In general use among tf.e
Dutcli in South Africa.— London Globe.

ORIGIN OF PLUM DUFF."
Hair a Famous Dish of English Sail-
or* Got Its Nam*.
There are many traditions respecting
the origin of the name "plum duff,"
the great holiday dish of sailors. No
feast on shipboard is considered per
fect without it According to the story
given ln the history of the British
navy, an English brig in the south Pa
cific was caught ln a series of awful
hurricanes. All on board were anxious
to reach a port in time for Christmas,
but the holiday found them still off the
Navigator islands. Worst of all, they
bad shipped a sea that carried away
the hencoop containing a few chickens.
When the cook saw the Christmas
dinner floating ln the lee scuppers and
ln danger of going overboard he made
a gallant charge down the slippery,
sloping deck to recover It, but at that
moment a great wave rose high over
the bulwarks, broke with ' resistless
fury on the very spot where he stood,
and when it subsided cook and chick
ens bad both disappeared.
This unfortunate accident left the
crew not only without a Christmas
dinner, but without any one to pre
pare an ordinary meal. The sailors
were heartily sick of "hard tack" and
remembered with longing the famous
plum pudding of merry England. They
determined that somehow they must
have a Christmas pudding and drew
lots as to who should be the cook. I
The choice fell on the boatswain's
mate, a brawny son of the Emerald
Isle. In the galley he found an old
cookbook. This be solemnly pored
over ln search of something promis
ing, but for lack of skill or materials
found, nothing he dared venture upon.
At last he settled upon a recipe which
began, "Make a stiff dough." When
he reached the word dough he said to
himself, "If r-o-u-g-h spells ruff,
d-o-u-g-h spells duff." . s ,' \
So he made the pudding, putting ln
some fine Malaga raisins, and served
it out with a generous quantity of rich
sauce. The sailors hailed It with de
light and appreciation. "What d'ye
call it?" they asked. "Plum duff,"
said the proud cook. And plum duff
it bas remained from that day to this.

A farmer tells of an old Irishman in
his employ whom he once permitted to
make use of certain land for farming
purposes on condition that Pat should
give him one-fourth of the crop he
raised. At the harvesting of the crop
the farmer was amazed to find the
Irishman had not kept his part of the
agreement, 'for while he hauled away
three wagon loads of produce he had
not sent a single load to his master's
barn. The farmer called Pat's atten
tion to the fact that he had taken the
entire crop, asking: "Now, how!s that, J
Pat? Wasn't I to receive a fourth of
the crop?" "You was, sir; you was,"
excitedly exclaimed the Irishman, "but
there's only three loads, sir; only three
loads."

"It's perfect nonsense, Bessie, for you to
talk of being laid on the shelf. Why, it all
depends on yourself. Forget your worries,
your aches and ailments ; do as I did, take
plenty of out-of-door air, cultivate happi-
ness by not allowing your mind to dwell
on the trifles and the worries of life. I sent
thirty-one cents in stamps to Dr. R. V.
Pierce, of Buffalo, N. V., for his ' Common
Sense Medical Adviser,' and found it con-
tained much useful information about the
care of my health, about physiology, anat-
omy, and everything a woman should know.
I then decided to write Dr. Pierce and tell
him all about my ailments. I received
such a nice, carefully considered and con-
fidential letter, in reply, giving me advice
about my diet, exercise and all. This
advice is free to everyone and I wonder you
don't write him at once. It didn't take me
many months to refrain my good looks.
Ever since I was fifteen I have suffered
untold agonies periodically but now I am
free from pain, worry and bad temper. Oc-
casionally I took Dr. Pierces Pleasant
Pellets — this for the complexion, and to
stimulate the liver. Then I took Dr.
Pierces Favorite Prescription three times

POLITICAL ARROGANCE.
A noticeable feature developed in
the initial stages of the presidential
campaign is the readiness with which
the subordinate bodies of both po
litical parties have entered into the
business of instructing delegates. A
few years back it would have been
looked upon as a serious breach of
trust for any state or county com
mittee to attempt to lay down in
structions for a nominating conven
tion. A political committee has
really nothing to do with shaping
the views of the rank and file of the
party. Tt is supposed to represent
and follow the ideas of the majority.
It is nothing short of arrogance for
a few men, selected merely to set
the party machinery in motion and
to look after material matters, to
tell the party as a whole what course
it ought to pursue. Such an abuse
of authority tends to contention and
dissension. It cannot have a bene
ficial effect, but on the contrary is
calculated to needlessly stir up
strife. And yet this spirit of in
structiou has developed to an alarm
ing extent this year. Both state
committees led the way in this direc
tion, and the cue has been taken up
by the local committees all over the
state with an avidity never before
manifested. This shows the force of
a bad example, and exemplifies how
careful official bodies ought to be in
not overstepping the bounds of their
authority. The state has been, and
is being deluged this year with a
flood of instructions covering ques
tions upon which the party alone in
convention assembled has the right
to speak with authority. It may be
safely assumed that whenever an
official transcends his authority the
act is prompted by a wrongful mo
tive. In political bodies usurpation
of power is usually caused by boss
ism — the desire of some man to con
stitute himself the supreme ruler of
the party. Our sister county of
Calaveras has distinguished itself in
the variety and wide scope of in
structions indulged in by a political
committee. A report of the pro
ceeding of the republican county
committee is before us. It appoint
ed nine delegates to the state con
vention, and more than one half the
appointees are members of the com
mittee. After this modest exercise
of official power it proceeded to
"resolute" on national, state and
district questions, recommending a
candidate for president, congress
man and assemblyman. One state
official seems to have been studiously
overlooked, namely, State Senator
W. C. Ralston. This omission is all
the more noticeable froth the fact
that the senator was a resident of
that county when elected, while
Assemblyman McKenney, who is a
resident of Amador county, comes
in for a full share of compliment by
the committee. To cap the climax,
the following resolution winds up
the platform and resolutions sent
forth by this committee:
Resolved, That as. the first con
gressional district is essentially a
mining.district, we believe that this
interest is entitled to full recogni
tion, and we therefore instruct our
delegates to the district convention
to use all honorable means to secure
representative mining men as dele
gates to the national meeting at
Chicago.
The meaning of this is plain.
Both delegates to the national con
vention from this congressional dis
trict should be taken from the min
ing districts. This is a slap at
Humboldt county, for presuming to
have a candidate for national dele
gate in the field, in the person of
Hon. J. C. Bull. Humboldt, with
its 2000 republican majority, placed
in the first district mainly for the
purpose of making it a republican
district, is thus told by a clique
of chronic place hunters that she has
no right to recognition in the selec
tion of delegates to the national con
vention. What particular role a
delegate from either the mining or
agricultural section can play in the
nomination of a presidential candi
date does not appear. The truth is,
two candidates from the mining coun
ties are aspiring for the honor of
representing the first district at the
Chicago convention, and one from
Humboldt. The Calaveras county
committee urges the district conven
tion to throw the Humboldt man
overboard, because mining interests
are paramount in this district. We
know not how the expression "our
delegates" will be appreciated by
our party friends in our sister coun
ty. Such a claim of ownership is
hardly consistent with harmony in
any political organization. We hope
the vicious advice to monopolize the
delegation to the national conven
tion will not be heeded. The ten
dency is to create sectional strife in
this congressional district — to array
one interest against" another. The
interests of the party must not be
imperilled at the bidding of design
ing politicians.

Mr. Arthur Stone, for years a resi
dent of Amador City, met with a ter
rible accident last Thursday. While
tending the pumps a timber slipped
from above, striking and throwing him
about two hundred feet, which caused
his death. Services were held Sunday
at the M. E. church, after which the
remains were taken to Sutler Creek
and buried in the I. O. O. F. cemetery,
he being a member of that order.
Richard Beskcen, a young man well
known in this town, where he lived for
a number of years, had his life crushed
out at the machine shops of the South
ern Pacific at Sacramento last Monday
morning. The victim was an employe
of the company. His untimely death
was brought about in a singular man
ner. The Bee gives the following
particulars: Beskeen was sitting on the
axle of an oil car, screwing up some
bolts. A switch engine was moving
some cars on the track next to the one
under which Beskeen was working. A
small block of wood was standing on
end beside the track, and caught on
the journal box of the second car from
the engine. The block acted as a lever
and threw the rear wheels of the car
off the track. This was unnoticed, and
the car struck the oil car under which
Beskeen was working. It started the
oil car in motion, knocking it off the
stands upon which it had been placed
and dragging Beskeen to death beneath
the wheels. The whole affair happen
ed so quickly that nobody realized
what had been done, until some of Bes
keen's companions looked under the
car, only to find him dead. Beskeen
was a young man. about 20 years of
age. He was a natiye of Kern county,
California. He leaves a mother, three
sisters and two brothers, who reside at
1810 M Street.

A Bhort Trip.
On Friday of last week we left Ama
dor City for a business trip through
the Drytown, Plymouth, and Oleta
sections, and were surprised at the gen
eral appearance of the natural scenery,
the thrifty growth of grass and crops,
and the bright outlook' for a reason
able compensation for all energies and
time expended in every shade of Indus
try. The roads were in fairly good
condition, and being seated behind %
spirited horse, viewing everything, as
we passed, it seemed but a few minutes
when we reached Drytown.
Drytown feels the effects of the
Fremont-Gover strike, for many of the
working men often spent their even
ings lounging around the business
houses, and spending their money in
her channels of trade. Notwithstand
ing the temporary setback she still
presents a thrifty appearance, and the
business men ail seem to be prospering.
The town hall has been remodelled,
and its neat and cleanly appearance will
attract the attention of passers-by * for
months to come.
Florence Giann'.ni runs the hotel and
butcher shop, and we know of no hotel
in the county where one can get a
better meal for 25c.
A. Me Wayne conducts a general 
merchandise store, with George ;C.'
Jennings as clerk. Mr. Me Wayne also
owns one of the best stock farms In
the county. He considers it useless^ to
take his stock to the mountains this
year, as it will be impossible for them
to consume the heavy growth of grass
on the home place.
Ex-supervisor Le Mbin is the village
blacksmith, and his shop is crowded
with work the greater portion of the
time. He has taught his people, that
it pays to patronize a home institution
by turning them out first class work at
reasonable prices. The town supports
two saloons, that seem to be doing well,
and are run In a quiet, orderly manner.
Plymouth is one of the substantial
towns of the county. Not what she
was in bustle and noise during the days
of the Empire and Pacific, but a good
solid business town, made so by being
the center of trade for one of . the best
farming portions of the state— the
Shenandoah valley. Plymouth could
gain much by the opening up of a few
of her many mining prospects, but she
can lose nothing by their remaining
idle. She has a solid backing that can
never grow weaker, but all the time is
growing stronger. She has four gen
eral merchandise stores, two of which
carry upwards of a $30,000 stock each,
three first class hotels, a splendid
meat market, two blacksmith shops,
two barber shops, two undertaking
parlors, four saloons, a drug store, a
harness shop, and a livery stable.
There are two resident physicians, and
two teachers are employed In the pub
lic school. It Is claimed that more
farming Implements are sold in Ply
mouth than in any other two towns in
the county. The Bar State and Shen
andoah mines are about three miles
distant, but their trade helps the town.
Taking everything into consideration,
her future Is very promising.
Oleta — Here It was where many of
the immigrants first began to search
for gold, and here It was where many
of them made and lost fortunes. To
day but little prospecting is being done,
although it is the opinion of many that
millions of the precious metal still re
mains buried beneath the surface.
Oleta is peopled with enterprising men
and women, as shown by the erection
of one of the most substantial and com
modious I. O. O. F. halls in Amador
county. Both the subordinate and
Rebekahs have a large membership,
and not once during our stay did : we
hear the business men speak of hard
times. Traveler.

STRIKE SITUATION AT FRE
MONT.
Men Failed to go to Work on Mon
day, and the Trouble is Still On.
At the close of last week it was
understood that the strike at the Fre
mont mine near Drytown was settled,
and that the men would resume work
Monday morning. When the time
came the men were on hand, but it was
soon evident that company and em
ployes wore not agreed. The miners
demanded that all those who bad quit
should be taken back. Superintendent
Goodall was not prepared to do this,
even if he were willing. The air com
pressor was undergoing repair*, and it
was impracticable to employ the full
working force. Besides he was not in
clined to bind himself to re-employ all
who had been discharged. The men
thereupon refused to go to work, and
the strike was declared to be still on.
It is reported that the union sanc
tioned the strike, and the demands
have been enlarged to include an in
crease of 25 cents per day in the wages
of underground men, and also recogni
tion of tbe union.
On Tuesday tbe superintendent sent
an ultimatum to the men that their de
mands could not be granted; that the
company would run the mine on the
same basis as heretofore; that the
right to employ and discharge men
could neither be surrendered nor
abridged ; that the mine would be dosed
down rather than surrender.
If the strike continues for any length
of time, it will prove a serious backset
to that section of tbe county. Tbe
Fremont Company is not in a position
to stand additional expense in trying
to run the property under strike con
ditions. The principal owners are well
to-do. They are independent of the
mine. Indeed, the mine so far has
proved a sink-hole for capital. It has
given no adequate return on the capital
invested. Just as it is getting into
good working shape, with development
work in progress looking to the in
crease of the milling capacity this labor
trouble comes along, throwing a dark
shadow over the whole raining indus
try.
There was rock enough on the dump
to run the 40 stamp mill for several
weeks. The strike has le<l to the quit
ting of some of the surface men, and
a reduction of the stamps in operation
to one half. Wednesday night the mill
was closed down. The rock being low
grade it would hardly justify to keep
the mill going with less than the full
complement of stamps.
This morning tbe situation was un
changed. The mill came to a standstill
on account of the exhaustion of the ore
on hand. The union held a protracted
session Wednesday night, but the out
come has not been learned, the men
being pledged to secresy. One picket
is employed to watch in the interest of
the strikers, and two extra watchman
are employed by tbe company at night.
A report is current that tbe strike is
apt to extend to other mines, but on
this point we have failed to secure any
thing definite. The assayer at tbe Fre
mont is away on a vacation of two
weeks. No serious damage would re
sult to the underground workings by a
stoppage of several weeks. However,
a prolonged shut-down Is hardly prob
able. Mr Goodall would much prefer
to operate with Amador county men,
but if labor cannot bo had here, on ac
count of union influences, an effort will
doubtless be made to secure it else
where. It is safe to say the Fremont
will be run by those who have their
money invested therein, or it will re
main idle. Outside of labor union cir
cles public opinion is overwhelmingly
on the side of the company. It is the
same fundamental issue tbat was re
cently raised in tho threatened street
car strike in San Francisco— tbe right
of the employer to conduct his business
to suit himself. ;;'•,.:
Sold Oat.
Fred Setzer, the old and reliable
butcher of Amador City, has sold his
stock and butcher business to the Cul
bert Estate, and will give possession on
or about the first of June. Mr. Setzer
has been doing business in Amador
City for 20 years, and is known by
everyone as "Honest Fred." He still
holds large property interests in the
town, and will no doubt remain in
Amador for • some time, if not per
manently. The Culbert Estate man
agers are large stock raisers, and will
undoubtedly prove worthy successors
to Mr. Setzei'.
Democratic Delegates Appointed.
Last Sunday afternoon the demo
cratic county committee met in Jack
son, for the purpose of selecting dele
gates to the state convention which
meets next Monday in Santa Cruz.
Owing to the delay in calling the offi
cial body together, it was out of the
question to select representatives by a
convention or primary election. It
was determined to appoint outright.
The following were elected delegates:
A. Caminetti, at large; Township 1,
C. P. Vicini, (alternate W. H. Cariey);
Township 2, J. D. Perkins; Township
3, J. H. Zumalt; Township 4, W. L.
Rose; Township 5, W. ft. McCormick.
The bitterness of tho Hearst or antir
Hearst fight was not introduced. The
feeling was thoro, but it wag not called
into action by any resolution of pledg
ing the delegates to any particular
candidate. They are unpledged, and
are probably divided in their presi
dential preferences.

THE RAILROAD
PROPOSITION
The railroad is coming, and coming
soon, if all signs of the times do not
fail. The people of Amador county
are ready, and have been ready for
years to welcome its arrival. It mat
ters but little to us what route it
takes, what town it touches first,
w hether it be single or double track,
broad or narrow gauge, whether pro
pelled by steam or electricity, or who
furnishes the money and brains to get
it through just so it gets here, and gets
here in time to handle the immense
amount of freight that will be used in
the mining belt during the coming win
ter season. It does not stand to reason
that men who put their money into an
enterprise of this kind can cater to the
wish of one man or a dozen men. They
must look first to their own interests,
and where those interests conflict with
individual Interests the latter must be
dropped and the former adopted. If
by selecting a route that would bring
the road from lone to Jackson and
then on to Amador City, the company
found they could get better results than
by running from lone to Amador and
thence on to Jackson, let them adopt
the first route and reject " the last.
But if on the other band the latter
proposition should seem tho most
feasible to the company, then build the
road over that route, and reap the
largest reward possible for the money
expended. What we want is the road,
and we want it right away. Wbat dif
ference if we reach home 15 minutes
before or 15 minutes after the people
from Sutter and Amador. If we are
the last to arrive we can even things
up the next trip by getting 15 minutes
the start of our neighbors. Let us
quit bickering over routes and try to
get the road.
Much sympathy is now being extend
ed to the poor teamsters, most of whom
have been playing a losing game ever
since they made their first trip, and the
question is being asked, What will they
do with their teams? Can anyone
point out an instance where a railroad
passed through a new country that it
dii not open up new enterprises that
required the use of two horses and men
where but one bad been used before.
What became of the negro* when Whit
ney invented the cotton gin? Many
ventured the assertion that he would
have to be exterminated, but no, he
was put to cultivating large areas of
the soil, the production of cotton in
creased, and to-day the south is one of
the most prosperous sections on the
fase of the globe. Slaves wore in
greater demand than ever, and just so
will horses be after we get the railroad.
The parties now proposing to build
the road are all business men, and have
gone to work in a business-like manner.
They first ascertained the amount of
business that they could reasonably
depend upon, put everything, down in
black and white, and by liberal calcula
tions decided that it would be a safe
and paying investment. After secur
ing substantial financial backings, such
as the California State Bank of Sacra
mento, they, proceed to incorporate,
specified tho route as nearly as it was
possible to do so at that time, estimated
the cost at so much per mile, and
actually paid in, in cash, to treasurer
J. J. Fagan ten percent of the subscrib
ed capital. They have asked for the
franchise tp run through the county,
and the supervisors have done their
duty by ordering it sold to the highest
bidder on the 6th day of June, which
is in accordance with the state law. It
is not presumed that any other com
pany will endeavor to outbid the pro
moters of the present schemo, for it
would only necessitate a delay in se
curing another. A large force of men
are in the field making surveys, get
ting distances, estimating grades, and
figuring on probable costs. As soon as
the franchise is definitely secured
rights of way will be asked for, and if
obtained without difficulty the directors
and financiers will be called together,
the route selected, the final survey
made, contracts for grading let, and
the work will actually begin and be
pushed to an early completion. The
state law requires that five miles be in
operation within one year after the
franchise is securedi but this company
does not hesitate to say that the entire
road will be in operation in less time.
We trust that no unforseen difficulty
will arise to retard the early completion
of the road. Amador county is far be
hind her neighboring . counties in this
matter, and as there can be no doubt
about it being a paying proposition we
see no further cause for delay.
Stock Kaising.
J. A. Vanderpool, who formerly
conducted a harqess. shop in Sutter
Creek, is now running a similar busi
ness on the Sacramento .road", two miles
west of Plymouth. Mr. Vaaderpool is
also engaged in raising stock. At one
time be owned the fastest pacing horse
in the stato, and it is now his ambition
to own and drive a two-minute trotter.
Mr. Vanderpool already has some very
promising colts. He Is raising some
fine cattle as well as horses, and ex
pects soon to be able to soil about $1000
worth of stock each year. Ho owns
185 acres pf land well watered, and the
grass this, year is so. rank that ho will
be able to fill his large barns with stock
hay. It is a pleasure to talk with Mr.
Vandorpool on the subject of stock
raising.
Plead Guilty.
In the superior court on Monday,
Edward Rowc, tho Preston School es
cape, plead guilty to tho charge of
'-'assault to commit murder, " and was
sentenced by Judge Rust to serye a 10
years' term in San Quontin prison.

WANTFD FOE TRAIN BOB
BERY AND MURDER.
George Gates is Suspected of being Im
plicated in ' the Shasta County Train
Hold-Up.
This community was much exercised
last Saturday on the arrival of the San
Francisco papers stating that George
Gates — with a criminal record against
him in this county — was suspicioned of
being the prime mover in the hold-up
of the Southern Pacific train at Cop
ley, in Shasta county, on the 31st of
March, at which timo the express mes
senger, W. J. O'Neil, was shot and iv
stantly killed. It is claimed that three
men are concerned in this crime —
namely George Gates and Vernon Gates,
his brother, aged 27 and 21 respective
ly, and a Mexican named James Arnet
of Modoc county. The Gates boys
were brought up in Jackson. The
family lived for many years at Ken
nedy flat, where thy father was owner
of the sulphurels tailings plant in con
nection with the Kennedy mine. George
is the oldest child. He was wanted by
the officers here for a daring robbery
committed on the 11th of April, 1902,
at the saloon of Andrew Piccardo, on
the Jackson Gate road. At a late hour
he appeared at that resort, with a rude
mask over his face, and at the point, of
a pistol stiHTti Tap several men that hap
pened to be there, and demanded that
the iron safe should be opened. He
gathered up some loose money from
the till and the men, but did not get
tbe contents of the safe. When about
to leave, young Piccardo seized a shot
gun and tired at the desperado as he
was making his exit from the premises.
He was badly wounilei] in the hip, and
it is now known that ho stayed in Sut
ter Creek for several days thereafter
to recover from his injuries sufficiently
to travel. A day or two after he left
the county by« way of Middle Bar, it
became known that he was involved,
and probably the sole perpetrator of
this crime. The officers started on his
trail, but be succeeded in getting out
of the state.
Six months after this plunge into a
career of crime, four men attempted to
hold up a Colorado train at a place
called Bishoar Junction. One of the
robbers was killed, and the survivors
failed in their entorpriso. George Gates
is credited with being one of the men
implicated in that work.' Since that
adventure Gates is said to have oper
ated at various points between San
Francisco and Seattle. His brother
Vernon is thought to have joined him
in the path of crime within the last six
months. The bandits w«ro last seen
in Southern Oregon, traveling toward
Portland. The offloers expect to effect
their capture in a short timo". George
is a man of nerve, and desperate. He
is likely to put up a stilt fight before
he is captured.
Potter's Petition.
A few weeks ago a petition was pre
sented to the board of supervisors ask
ing for an increase in price for licenses
granted to a certain class of peddlers.
When printed it road as though the
idea originated with H. E. Potter of
Plymouth, and has been christened
"Potter's petition." Mr. Potter signed
the petition after many others had
signed, but had nothing whatever to
do with getting it up, or originating
the idea. He signed merely to assist
in safe-guarding the business which he
represents..

NOTES FROM
GOLD MINES
Del Monte— At the meeting of the
directors held last week an assessment
of 5 cents per share was levied. The
main fissure encountered by the big
tunnel has not been followed to any ex
tent yet. The quartz vein is two feet
thick, and prospects well in free gold.
Assays indicate a value of from Sl3 to
over $20 to the. ton. The fissure is
fully six feet between walls, and the
whole is heavily mineralized. The
mill was kept running a portion of last
month on rock from the upper tunnel,
the amount realized being in the neigh
borhood of $700, not including sulphur
ets, of which there is between 2 and 3
tons on hand.
Telegraph Hill— lt is reported
that rich gravel has been encountered
at this mine and in paying quantity.
We hope the report is true, as the
company has worked faithfully, and
paid their men promptly. Amador
county needs just such men to develop
her resources. Mr. Eaton has been
superintendent since operations first
began.
Madrone— This mine is in the Pio
neer district, about five miles from the
town of Volcano, and two miles from
the Defender mine. It is now being
operated by C. S. Leslie & Co. Mr.
Leslie is an experienced miner from
Tuolumne county, and having heard of
the excellent opportunities for men of
limited means to develop mines in this
section, determined to risk a few dol
lars and a little labor in' ascertaining
whether or not these stories were true.
He has been here about 18 months, and
now has control of several good pros
pects. He takes particular pride in the
Madrone, and is working it upon a
common sense, • business-like plan.
Three tunnels have been run,' .five, six,
and eight hundred feet respectively.
Each tunnel encounters the ledge about
300 feet below the surface, so that the
ledge is now exposed for 400 feet.
Each man is now getting out about one
ton of pay rock per day. 48 tons were
milled last year, which yielded $26.60
per ton. Between 90 and 100 tons are
now on the dump, being of a much
richer grade than that already milled.
A 100-ton test will soon be worked, and
Mr. Leslie estimates it at $40 per ton.
Tbe $7 and $10 rock is laid to one side
until a mill can be erected upon tho
property. When asked how long tbe
mine could supply a 10-stamp mill, Mr.
Leslie answered, continuously. Kim
ball & Sons own three properties ad
joining tbe Madrone, of which we will
speak in another issue.
Amador Good Enough.
Antone Cavagnaro, a young man
born and raised in Amador City, ac
companied by his parents, has just re
turned from a trip to Italy, whither
they went for the purpose of sight
seeing, and possibly remaining if tbe
surroundings were satisfactory. After
spending one year in Europe, they con
cluded that America was the best and
most prosperous country on earth, and
tbat it would be impossible for them to
over be satisfied to live in any other
country. They expect to locate per
manently in Amador county. This is
the same old story oft repeated. Peo
ple come to ' America, live here for a
time, become dissatisfied and want to
go back to their mother country, but
once here, nine out of every ten return
and become substantial citizens.
Busy County Officers.
Sheriff Norman is out after the
Copley train robbers.
Deputy Kay took one of the Preston
School boys to Yolo last week, as a
witness in the Wppds case-
Constable Kelley of lone, took the
young man Howe to San Quentin Tues
day, where be goes to take up a 10
years' residence, and chief deputy
Jackson on Thursday accompanied
Mrs. Poll, who was on Wednesday ad
judged Insane by Drs. Gall and Lonigo,
to the Napa insane asylum, where she
will remain until she fully regains her
health and consciousness.
Deputy Kay is now in charge of the
office, and constable Laverone is keep
ing a watchful eye on everybody while
the other executive officers are absent
from the county.
Church Hotice.
There will be no services in the
Methodist church on Sunday, May 15,
owing to the fact that the contractors
are now at work repairing the build -
ing. On May 22nd, however, services
will be held as usual. Dr. Phelps re
ports tbat the subscriptions a.r-0 coming
in prqm.pt.ly, a.qd wh,ile they were to be
made in three instalments, most sub
scribers are paying up in full without
solicitation. This shows a commend
able spirit in Jackson's enterprising
people.

lone, and placed the same in the cus
tody of F. L. Stewart, with instructions
to deliver said deed to Susanna Hart

purpose of avoiding probate proceed
ings upon the property, the plaintiff at

••••••••••••••••••••••••a*AN INDIAN DUEL.
The Famona Fight Between Chief
Carpenter and Price.
"The methods of fighting duels among
the Indians," said an old frontiersman,
"were varied, each tribe having its own
peculiar custom. Some of the tribes
learned to fight according to the code
of the white man, however, among
these the Choctaws or Cherokees,
which reminds me of the famous duel
in July of 1883, when the celebrated
Choctaw chief, Carpenter, fought near
the Pine Creek Indian agency with a
white man named Price. Chief Car
penter was a splendid type of Indian,
tall and straight and comely, and he
had been well educated and had natu
ral talents and natural instincts that
put him head and shoulders over bis
Indian associates.
"As usual, this trouble was started
by a disagreement over some trivial
matter, which caused a dispute and
ended in the white man calling his
red brother a liar. Throughout the
trouble the big Indian had remained
perfectly calm, although considerably
angered, and as the insult fell he gazed
coldly into the eyes of Price and said:
" 'Your blood shall wash out that
word.'
" 'Whenever you're ready, say tho
word,' cried Price. 'You can do your
washing right here and now if you
please.'

Ing, when the sun peeps over the top
of that wild plum tree, you must be
here and without fail.*
"The report of the duel spread far
and wide, and at an hour considerably
before sunrise a large crowd had gath
ered on the dueling ground to witness
the encounter. Price was the first on
the field, and for a time it looked as if
there would be no Carpenter. But,
true to his Indian blood, the chief dis
dained coming too soon at the appoint
ed place as much as he would have
feared coming too late, and it was just
as the first rays of the sun stole over
the soft green of the tree that the red
man stood in place. Not a word was
spoken by either man. Both drew their
pistols, and, raising the weapons, they
fired almost simultaneously. Carpen
ter reeled, but with a mighty effort
checked a tendency to spin round, and,
staggering, fired as the crack of his op
ponent's pistol sounded for the second
time. This time Price jumped high in
the air and landed on his face stone
dead.
"With a wild shout the crowd press
ed forward to surround the lucky chief,
but before aid could reach him he fell
senseless. Price had been shot through
~th<T heart, clean as a whistle, a remark
able shot considering the condition of
the Indian when be made it, and a
shot Carpenter could have made xs
the first place without a doubt had he
been as determined to kill as Price
proved himself when his bullet burled
itself in the Indian's breast."

Eight months ago I was so ill
that I was compelled to lie or sit
down nearly all the time. My
stomach was so weak and upset
that I could keep nothing on it
and I vomited frequently. I
: could not urinate without great
- pain and I coughed so much that
my throat ana lungs were raw
and sore. The doctors pro-
nounced it Bright "a disease and
. others said it was consumption.
It mattered little to me what
they called it and I had no de- W
sire to live. A sister visited me fj
from St. Louis and asked me if H
I had ever tried Wine of Cardui. H
I told her I had not and she S
bought a bottle. I believe that El
it saved my life. I believe many H
women could save much suffer- fcj
ing if they but knew of its value. H
Don't you want freedom from E
pain? Take Wine of Cardui B
and make one supreme effort to D
be well. You do not need to be M
a weak, helpless sufferer. You H
can have a woman's health and - «
do a woman's work in life. Why • w&

OPENING PARLIAMENT.
The Pomp With Which It Was Done
by Queen Victoria.
The trumpets sound! The queen ap
proaches! The trumpet continues, and
first enter at a side door close at my
elbow the college of heralds richly
dressed, slowly, two and two. Then
the great officers of the household, then
the lord chancellor bearing purse, seal
and speech of the queen, with the mace
bearers before him. Then Lord Lans
downe with the crown, the Earl of Zet
land with tlie cap of maintenance and
the Duke of Wellington with the sword
of state. Then Prince Albert, . leading
the queen, followed by the Duchess of
Sutherland, mistress of the robes, and
the Marchioness of Douro, daughter
in-law of the Duke of. Wellington, who
is one of tlie ladles in waiting. The
queen and prince sit down, while every
body else remains standing. The queen
then says in a voice most clear and
sweet, "My lords, (rolling the r), be
seated." Upon which the peers sit
down, except those who enter with the
queen, who group themselves about
the throne in the most picturesque
manner. The queen had a crown of
diamonds, with splendid necklace and
stomacher of the same. The Duchess
of Sutherland close by her side with
her ducal coronet of diamonds and a
little back Lady Douro, also with her
coronet On the right of the throne
stood the lord chancellor, with scarlet
robe and flowing wig, ' holding the
speech, surrounded by the emblems of
his office; a little farther, one step lower
down, Lord Lansdowne, holding the
crown on a crimson velvet cushion,
and on the left the Duke of Wellington,
brandishing the sword of state in the
air, with tlie Earl of Zetland by his
side. The queen's train of royal purple,
or, rather, deep crimson, was borne
by many train bearers. The whole
scene seemed to me like a dream or a
vision. After a few minutes the lord
chancellor came forward and presented
the speech to the queen. She read it
sitting and most exquisitely. Her voice
is flutelike and her whole emphasis de
cided and intelligent. Very soon after
the speech is finished she leaves the
bouse, and we all follow as soon as we
can get our carriages.— Mrs. George
Bancroft in Seribner's.

Many Sadden Death* oa Sunday.
"Did you ever notice there are more
sudden deaths in Philadelphia on a
Sunday than any other dny In the
week?" remarked a policeman. "It is
true, and the records prove it. The
police book In the electrical bureau in
the city hall contains this record.
Sometimes the fatalities of this nature
are double the number of any week
day. How do I account for it? I don't.
I simply hazard a guess or two. It
may be that folks ent more heartily
on Sunday, and this fact no doubt ag
gravates certain ailments, bringing on
acute attacks of heart disease and indi
gestion. For fifteen years I have no
ticed the excessive number of deaths
on Sunday, yet I have never heard any
one give a reason other than I have
mentioned."— Philadelphia Press.
The Goal of Unlonlani.

as inevitable as that an acorn will
grow into a tree. All things must grow
or die; they cannot stay still even if
they would.
To say that laboring men should be
satisfied with a certain rise In wages
or other favoruble conditions is like
saying that a rosebud should not want
to blossom. The trouble with many
people is that they cannot change their
viewpoint, which must be done always
as the world grows.— Rohert Bruce

A COOL OFFICER.
Be Faced an Angry London Mob and
Got Fair Play.
During the reform riots in Hyde
park, London, In 1866 the mob on a
well remembered night began tearing
down the fences of Hyde.pnrk for fires
and barricades. Colonel Thomas Went
worth Htgginson tells In the Atlantic
Monthly of an English officer who was
dining with a- friend, all unconscious
of the impending danger. Presently
he received a summons from the wai
department, telling him that his regi
ment was ordered out to deal with the
mob.
He hastened back to his own house,
but when be called for bis horse he
found that his servant had received
permission to go out for the evening
and had the key. of the stable in his
pocket. The officer hastily donned his
uniform and then had to proceed on
foot to the guards' armory, which lay
on the other side of Hyde park. Walk
ing hastily in that direction, he came
out unexpectedly at the very headquar
ters of the mob, where they were al
ready piling up the fences.
His uniform was recognized, and an
gry shouts arose. It must have seemed
for the moment to the mob that the
Lord had delivered their worst enemy
into their hands.
There was but one thing to be done.
He made his way straight toward the
center of action and called to a man
who was mounted on the pile and was
evidently the leader of the tumult:
"I say, my good man, my regiment
has been called out by her majesty's
orders. Will you give me a band over
this pile?'
The man hesitated a minute and then
Bald, with decision: "Boys, the gentle
man is right He is doing his duty,
and we have no quarrel with him. Lend
a hand, and help him over." ; j
This was promptly done, with entire
respect and the officer in brilliant uni
form went hastily on bis way amid
three cheers from the mob. Then the
mob returned to its work, to complete
it if possible before he whom they aid
ed should come back at the head of his
regiment and perhaps order them to be
shot down. ■;- ;
POKER CHIPS.
There are more than four "knaves"
to the pack in some games. 'i* ■
In big hands, as with big guns, you
want to look out for the recoil. ; :
/ The moral motto, "Deal as you would
be dealt by," Is classed as the "joker"
in a poker pack.
It is awfully bad form, you know, to
let the loss of a few chips make you
look as cross as If you thought you
were getting the double one.
• It may be good advice to "bet your
hand for all it's worth," but it is a
mighty dangerous thing to bet it for
all or more than you are worth.
Novice asks which is the right way
to cut the cards. Our experience teach
es us, my boy, that the right way and
at the same time the only safe one is
to cut them precisely as does a gilded
hog a shabby acquaintance.— New York

A Japanese Legend.
The renown of the Japanese for cour
age was as remarkable In Marco Po
lo's day as It Is In the present. He
narrates the story of an Invasion of
the country by the forces of the khan
of Tartary. A Japanese army of 30,000
men was besieged in a tower. Refus
ing to surrender," they fought until all
but eight of them were killed. On
these eight— travelers' wonders must
creep in — it was found impossible to in
flict any wound. "Now, this was by
virtue of certain stones which they had
in their amis, inserted between the
skin and the llesli. And the charm and
virtue of these stones were such that
those who wore them could never per
ish by steel." They were therefore
beaten to death with clubs.
Making: It Clear.
On board an ocean steamship a gen
tleman wished to help a lady who was
of an inquiring mind to comprehend
the principle of the steam engine. This
is how lie cleared away all difficulties;
"Why, you see, ma'am," quoth he,
"it's just one thing goes up and then
another thing comes down, and then
they let the smoke on. which makes the
wheels go round. That's what they
call the hydraulic principle. It's quite
simple when you kuow It."
"Law me! I never understood it be
fore. But, then, I never had It proper
ly explained," replied the fair listener.
—Tit-Bits.
RrnlUm Explained.
• "That was a splendid back fall you
made in your death scene last night,"
remarked a young member of the com
pany to the eminent tragedian. '
The latter looked at the flatterer
with a suspicious glare.
"Yes," he said, "and I'd like to lay
my hands on the blithering idiot who
soaped the stage floor." — Cleveland
Plain Dealer.
A Cautious Youth.
"Bobby, your father wants to see
you."
The boy looked dubious.
"Do I want to Bee him?" he asked.
"fiow should I know?" *
"You ought to be^able to tell by the
look in his eye."— Chicago Poster ~s<- r
Out of Her Line.
"So you were at Mrs. Marrable's din
ner yesterday, Flossie. What was the
menu like?"  
"I really can't tell you, for I didn't
take any. It's a thing I very seldom
touch."

THROWN UPON THE STAGE.
The Way English Audiences Reward
Popular Players With Gifts.
There have lately in the provinces
been several sensational nights at
prominent theaters whfu to mark the
last performance of a local pantomime
ali manner of gifts have been thrown
upon the stage for the benefit of popu
lar performers.
AH those acquainted for long with
the Inner life of the theatrical profes
sion can tell some remarkable' stories
of these gifts cast upon the stage. The
most celebrated and universal of these
relates to a lady who once held the
main portion of the lease of a promi
nent London theater. While this lady
. was still an ■ actress only and not a
manageress, an actress of great talent
and beauty, there was one night on the
first production of the piece a small
bouquet cast upon the stage at her
feet. Attached to the bouquet was a
small Russia leather card case, and in
side this were bank notes to the value
of £1,000 exactly. On no fewer than
seven different occasions, with a toler
ably long interval between, did the
same thing occur, and the lady, as al
leged, has never from that day to this
discovered who her admirer was,
though all manner of romantic conjec
tures were made at the time.
Even within the last few weeks an
unknown elderly gentleman threw an
envelope weighted with- pennies and
containing a five pound note to a tiny
child performing in a London subur
ban pantomime. Some theaters have
been celebrated for their gift nights,
all manner of presents, from frying
pans to green vegetables, having been
gently deposited on the stage for the
popular actors; yet, on the other band,
both writs and summonses have been
handed to actors who could not be ap
proached through the stage door; but
who consented to receive presents over
the footlights on/their benefit nights.
The most curious sight the writer
ever saw in connection with these gift
throwing, nights was in relation to a
favorite actor who, at a great provin
cial theater, played during a long pan
tomimic run the part of a parasite
named Cadgi, who carried a pipe
that had a huge bowl and whose oft
repeated cry was, "Can any one oblige
me with a bit o' 'baeca?" On the last
night of the performance the familiar
request for/a "bit o' 'bacca" had no
sooner beenjspoken than literally scores
of packets, 'and "screws" of tobacco of
every imaginable kind were thrown
upon the stage, more than 120 of these
falling about the actor.— London Tit-
Bits.
His Present.
"John," she said, "your little wifey
has been saving up her money to buy
you a nice present" . " : )
"Good little wifey," he replied.
"What is it?"
"A smoking jacket," she explained.
, "And I saved the money all myself out
of the house allowance. Wasn't I
thoughtful?"
"Splendid!" he exclaimed.
"And now I wish you'd bring me
home some more money tonight"
"What did you do with what I
brought home last night?" he asked in
some surprise.

Not to Be Hushed.
Bishop Littlejohn of Long Island,
who died at the age of ninety, refused
up to the day of his death to accept the
assistance of a coadjutor bishop, de
claring that he was perfectly able to
perform his duties and care for his
people. At a meeting of the clergy in
the last year of his life Archdeacon
Bryan was' requested to call the meet
ing to order. The archdeacon arose
and requestedthe delegates to give at
tention, remarking:
"The bishop wishes to say a few
words."
"A few words, sir; a few words!" in
terjected the bishop. "I would have it
understood, sir, that the bishop will
say as many words as' he pleases."

.which you can truthfully say that
praying has done you the slightest
service?"

good old elder. "If I hadn't stopped to
say my prayers the other morning I'd
have caught the 7:40 train into the
city, and instead of sixty-one passen
gers killed and Injured in the wreck
I'd have probably made the sixty-sec
