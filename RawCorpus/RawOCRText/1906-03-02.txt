A Little Vacation.
Conditions are changing in so many
businesses that it would not be strange
if the manufacturer had yet. to- plead
for protection against the -girl "In '.'.her
teens.
A young girl appeared at a large hat
manufactory one Monday morning and
asked jj for work. She was Inexperi
euced,*but they needed help badly, en
gaged her at once aud took the time to
teach her one department of the work.
She learned easily and very quickly,
earned something the first day and in
two days was making as much as any
other girl in the room. They noticed
that she seemed to enjoy the work and
the prospect of good wages and were
greatly surprised when she appeared at
the office Friday night and desired to
"settle up," saying that she was
through work.
The manager asked If anything dis
agreeable had happened.
"Oh, no," the girlreplled' airily. "It's
a real nice place to work, but I was
only visiting In the city for a few days
and thought I might make a little mon
ey. I'm going home tomorrow morn
ing."—Youth's Companion. ;. _ .J ,
Glnttona.
The old feudal lords of England were
the biggest hogs on earth. Their life
was made up of the chase, gluttony
and drunkenness. The habit" of glut
tony was handed down to them. It
came directly from Lucullus and his
Imitators. There is no doubt that Lu
cullus, held up before us as the table
saint, ate himself to death. It was not
only the quantity of food he ate, but
Its quality as well, that put so mis
erable an end to him. Fielding proved
many years ago that there was a large
amount of fudge about Lucullus. On
general principles he was, from a cu
linary point of view, a fraud. A single
supper at which Cicero and Pompey
were guests Is said to have cost him
50,000 denarl (about $8,500), but he
probably served his guests a feast of
barbecued sow, topped off with cher
ries. He was excessively vain of his
cherries, and, as for his sow, she was
always served high.— London Spectator.
The Onion.
"Onions are really sweeteners of the
breath after the local effects have pass
ed away," says one learned doctor.
This statement Is not in accordance with
our own experience; therefore we avoid
onions*. We are still further informed
by the same authority that onions cor
rect stomach disorders and carry oft
the accumulated poisons of the sys
tem. They provide a blood purifier
that all may freely use. Eaten raw an
onion will often check a cold In the
head. One small onion eaten every
night before retiring is this well known
doctor's prescription for numerous af
fections of the head and Is highly rec
ommended for sleeplessness. Person
ally, we are never troubled with any
of these complaints and therefore still
look upon this strange vegetable as
something to avoid.— Vegetarian.
When Yon Sneeze.
The alarm signal of a draft is a
sneeze, which Is a spasmodic effort of
nature to start up the circulation and
relieve the congestion. A person may
be far gone toward contracting a cold
before he sneezes, but the moment he
gets this warning he should change his
position, look around for the draft and
move out of It or protect himself
against it A draft Is something to be
sneezed at— and to be avoided. Drafts
cause more deaths than war, -whisky,
football, consumption and yellow fever
put together. Almost everybody who
dies from disease dates his sickness
from taking cold. This is especially
true of elderly people. Yet It Is a mat
ter in regard to which there are great
Ignorance and inattention.
Old Japanese Prints.
The collector of old Japanese prints
must be guided hi his selection by the
quality of the paper, which should be
soft and vibrant, the fibrous tentacles
upon its surface often forming, shad
ows where it has been exposed to the
dust. The register must be perfect,
each color being confined absolutely to
Its prescribed space. Perfection in the
register Is an Infallible guide. The col
ors must be soft and melting, In many
cases one tone shading into another,
not harshly determined by the lines of
the block.'— Extract From ''Impressions
of Ukiyo-ye," by Mrs. Dora Amsden.
Doesn't Like to Move.
A most curious and sluggish creature
is the tautawa, a nine inch lizard
whose home Is In New Zealand. This
little Imitation saurian has the reputa
tion of being the laziest creature ever
created. He is usually found clinging
to rocks or logs along the shores of riv
ers and lakes and has been known to
remain in one position perfectly mo
tionless for many months. How the
creature manages to exist Is a mystery.

JACKSON, AMADOU COUNTY. CALirOKiilA, FRIDAY. MARCH 2, 1906.
MOST POWERFUL PUMP
IN UNITED STATES.
in Operation at South Eureka Mine.
i Amador county has the distinction
of having the highest lifting pump in
the United States. It has just been
installed in the South Eureka mine,
at the 2030-foot level, aud lifts the
water from that point up the incline
shaft to the surface, which is equal to
1875 feet vertical. The pump throws
about 250 gallons of water per minute
or over 20 miners' inches. *■■ ■' v.~': T y ''■'/
It took about six months to put In
the equipment and cost 815,000.'.; iv A
large chamber was excavated in the
solid slate for the pump-station and a
concrete floor, three feet thick, upon
which the pump was anchored with
heavy bolts; it is a live-plunger pump
and makes 50 revolutions per minute,
and is driven by a 150-horse-power
electric motor which is adjacent to
the pump. It requires 125-horse
power to lift the water, which is pro
pelled through a heavy iron 6-inch
pipe, in 20-foot joints and each joint
weighs over 200 pounds. The elec
tricity is conveyed down the shaft to
the motor through a 3-inch steel
armored cable, which weighs nine
tons. Near the pump a large reser
voir has been constructed, with a
capacity of nearly 100,000 gallons,
into which the water from all parts
of the mine is drained by iron pines.
A connection with the mine adjoining
on the north, the Central Eureka, has
been made, and the .water of this
mine is likewise drained into this
reservoir and all pumped to the sur
face. The pump is operated at a total
cost of about 8250 per month, includ
ing wages of the pumpman. It re
quires but one man to operate the
whole equipment and the water of
both mines is lifted in less than eight
hours per day.
Under the old system of hoisting,
in large water barrels, holding from
700 to 800 gallons, it required much
longer and at much greater cost be
sides the wear on the shafts. Now
the shafts can be wholly devoted to
hoisting ore and double the amount
of ore can be hoisted than formerly.
The equipment was manufactured in
San Francisco and the plan of pump
ing was conceived and put into effect
by Attorney William J. McGee, who
is the president of the South Eureka
Mining Company. Both the South
and Central Eureka have forty -stamps
and together crush over 10,000 tons of
ore per month.— Sacramento Union.
Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign.
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. For
weak indigestion, for defective nour
ishment, for consumption, take
Scott's Emulsion. It testores flesh
because it strikes to the cause of the
loss.
iqnedsliel Soil
Impoverished soil, like impov-
erished blood, needs a proper
fertilizer. A chemist by analyz-
ing the soil can tell you what
fertilizer to use for different
products. *
If your blood is impoverished
your doctor will tell you what
you need to fertilize it and give
it the rich, red corpuscles that
are lacking in it. It may be you
need a tonic, but more likely you
need a concentrated fat food,
and fat is the element lacking
in your system.
There is no fat food that is
so easily digested and assimi-
lated as
Scott's Emulsion

It will nourish and strengthen
the body when milk and cream
fail to do it. Scott's Emulsion
is always the same; always
palatable and always beneficial
where the body is wasting from
any cause, either in children
or adults.

Man's Mortality.
Translated from an ancient Irish man
uscript by Dr. O'Donovan.
Like as the damask rose you see,:
Or like a blossom on a tree,
Or like the dainty flower in May,
Or like the morning to tbe day,
Or like the sun, or like the shade,
Or like the gourd which Jonas had;
Even such is man, whose thread is
spun,
Drawn out and out, and so is done.
Ihe rose withers, the blossom
blasteth,
The flower fades, the morning
hasteth,
The sun sets, the shadow flies,
The gourd consumes, the man— he
dies. '
Like to the grass that's newly sprung,
Or like a tale that's new begun,
Or like a bird that's here to-day,"; '*
Or like the early dew in May, I
Or like an hour, or like a span,
Or like the singing of a swan;
Even such is man who lives by breath,
Is here, now there, in life and death.
The grass withers, the tale is ended,
The bird is flow, the dew's ascended,
The hour is short,the span not long,
The swan's near death, man's life
is done.
Like to the bubble in tbe brook,
Or in a glass much like a look,
Or like a shuttle in weaver's hand,
Or like the writing on the sand,
Or like a thought, or like a dream,
Or like the gliding of a stream;
Even such is man who lives by breath,
Is here, now there, in life and death.
The bubble's out, the look's forgot,
The shuttle's flung, the writing's
blot,
The thought is past, the dream is
gone,
Tbe waters glide, man's life is done.
Like to an arrow from the bow,
Or like swift course of water's flow,
Or like the time 'twixt flood and ebb,
Or like the spider's tender web,
Or like a race or like a goal,
Or like the dealing of a dole;
Even such is man, whose brittle state
Is always subject unto tate.
The arrow shot, the flood soon spent,
The time no time, tbe web soon
rent,
The race soon run, the goal soon
won,
The dole soon dealt, man's life
soon done.
Like to the lightning from the sky,

The forester has fixed the grazing
season for cattle and horses for the
Stanislaus forest reserve as beginning
June 15th and ending October 31 fol
lowing, and a fee of 35 cts, per head
will be charged on animals over six
months old; a special concession will
be granted on the "first 50 head of
cattle as only Xl% cents each will be
charged for these, this concession
does not apply for horses. Saddle
horses necessary to properly handle
the permitted grazing stock, will be
permitted free to the limit of six
head. The saddle and pack animals
belonging to campers and prospectors,
also their work stock ' will not be
charged for. The total number of
cattle and horses allowed to graze
inside the Stanislaus forest reserve
for the ensuing season is fixed at
8,000 head.
52.000 head of sheep will be per
mitted to graze in the Stanislaus
forest reserve from July 15th to
October 31 following, and the grazing
fee is fixed at seven cents per head,
lambs under 6 months old will be
counted and rated two lambs equal
ing one grown sheep. Two driveways
for crossing have been established
and no charge will be made tor using
the driveway, but the forester has
decided that this privilege is a graz
ing privilege and will be issued to
those only who are full citzens, also
a permit must be obtained before the
stock shall be entitled to enter the
reserve. The distribution of the
ranges is now being made and each
applicant will receive due notice as
to the action taken in his case and
the amount of fees due trom him,
also" instructions as to forwarding the
same to the fiscal agent at Washing

The one-plate Lascelles-Davidson
process is ; claimed to yield beautiful
photographs in colors through the
color selective action of the varying
grades' of density of an ordinary bro
mide 'print. The negative must be
fully,; exposed and well developed,
whegiig white of the . natural . scene
will be opaque; the blue, semi
opaque; the green, of middle density;
the yellow, of somewhat less density;
tne red, faint, and the black will
show clear glass. From this negative
a bromide positive is printed, de
veloped and fixed in the usual way.
The print is then thoroughly washed,
bleached in a special compound,
rinsed, and the re-developing com
pounds are applied all over it. If
the red is applied first the red and
yellow deposits on the print are
affected, developing up to a red. The
blues aud greens only develop when
the compounds for those colors are
applied, then they are gradually built
up in the deposit of the print, and
the white takes no color at all, wash
ing quite clean uuless development
has been carried too lar.
The galvanometer may be made to
tell us much about ourselves. A
Swiss engineer, Herr E. K. Mulier,
has been testing electromagnetical
apparatus of treating headache and
other nervous disorders, . and in
cidentally is measuring the electrical
resistance of the human body, 'ibis
resistance is less in drinkers and
smokers than .in others. It varies
with physical condition, with the
time ot day, with physiological
action, with pain and other sensa
tions, with thought, and even with
dreams.
A prize of SSOO has been offered by
the Hydraulic Power Syndicate of
Grenoble, France, for a device auto

of electric current on the line of any

A peculiar digestive enzyme of the
horse converts cellular tissue into
sugar, and makes it possible for. this
animal to disgest a certain amount of
woody fiber. An English wood-sawyer
seems to be blessed with the stomach
of a horse, as he has discovered that
common deal wood, cut small, is a
valuable food and medicine, with
which brown bread is not to be com
pared for tonic and invigorating
effects. The London .Lancet points
out that the woody fiber may be con
verted into sugar by the prolonged
action of acid, and the sugar is a
valuable food of its class. For
human gastric juice to extract any-,
thing useful from wood, however, is
a rare idiosyncrasy. As worn-out
shirts and collars may yield sugar in
the same way as wood, it is suggested
that this individual may find his
white shirt superior ■ for • the table
even to white bread. • ' ;p'.-
White mice are to be put to novel
use in South Africa. It has been
shown that with 0.4 per cent of carbon
monoxide in the air, one of these
very susceptible animals becomes
unconscious in three minutes,' but
that a .man feels on discomfort for
half a hour. It is urged, therefore,
that operators of coal mines, and even
of metalliferous mines, be required to
test the air by means of these creat
ures whenever the presence of danger
ous gas is suspected.
Developing- photographio negatives
without the use ot dishes is a method
lately found to have certain advant
ages. The plate is wet under a water
tap, and the developer is then applied
with a lump of cotton wool. Parts
can be extra developed or held back
in a manner impossible by the usual
method. The new plan requires care,
however, as there is great risk of un
even action, and there are many
chances of failure. .-'.
The turbot is credited by a report
on North Sea fishes with the greatest
fecundity of any fish. In five speci
mens, the heaviest weighing 21
pounds, the number of eggs was from
sto 10 millions each. A halibut of
91 pounds contained 1,327,000 eggs.
A glimpse into a field of vast
possibilities was given at Berlin the
other day by Dr. Emil Fischer, who
first produced artificial grape sugar
and uric acid, and is the latest re
cipient of the Nobel prize for chemi
cal research. The work of the syn
thetic chemists has brought into pro
minence the ammo-acids, and these
Dr. Fischer pronounces the mite
stones on the road to artificial albu
men, although Virchow pronounced
this impossible to build up on
account of the great number of com
pounds that enter into it. When the
ammo-acids are freed from water,
the anhydrides greatly resemble
peptones, a group of bodies occurring
in the stomachs of all carnivorous
and herbivorous animals and not one
of whiett has yet been artificially
produced. The peptones result from
the decomposition of albumen by
the ferments of the pancreatio glands,
this decomposition being the physio
logical process known as digestion.
Without peptone, the albumen of
our food would be about as nourish
ing as sand or wood. The anhydride
ammo-acids have been named "pep
tine," and Dr. . Fisher has interred
that albumen is simply a compound
built up of many such peptJnes. By
synthesis of seven peptines he has
succeeded in forming a substance
like albumen. It can be beaten into
foam, and can be digested . by the
pancreatio juioe of a dog. He con
cludes that from thirty to forty pep
tines make a peptone, and that albu
men is a compound of several pep
tones, the problem for science being
to achieve tho right combination.
Albumen being the principal con
stituent of all animals and of grain,
its artificial production means artifi
cial food both bread and meat.
Iron worked up into watch-springs
does not represent the greatest in
crease in value given by labor to raw
material. The glass for a kilogramme
of fine lenses is stated to be worth
riot more than ten cents, but when
finished into tiny front. lenses for
microscope objectives the value would
be about 83,000,000. Eacli lens would
be worth about 85.00, while the value
ot a bit of gold of the same weight
would be only about one cent. Such,
at least, are the figures of some in
genious individual.
The Japanese as Manufacturers.
The progress of Japan in industrial
pursuits received recognition lately
in a way that started the American
press. Mezumo, a Japanese printer
of Tokio, shipped to San Francisco
a Japanese edition of the school
readers generally known as "Barnes'
National Headers. ' ' These books are
published in America by the Ameri
can Book -Company, .and sold for 57
cents. Mezumo places an exact dupli
cate on the market and fixes the
wholesale price delivered here in
America as 7>£ cents. ' There is food
for thought in Mezumo's offer. . -
That Japan has' certain advantages
that will tend ■to make of her a
formidable competitor in the in
dustrial markets of. the world there
can be little doubt. In the- first
place, labor is cheap. Money, the
second factor, however, is dear, the 1
rate in Japan being 9 per cent. The
problem of cheaper money solved,
and Japan , has the two requisites for
industrial success— cheap money and
cheaper labor, whose industrial
efficiency cannot be doubted: : '
It is to England that Japan 'has
gone for its money and already ovei
seven million dollars has been bor
rowed from that country. This is to
be invested in mills aud machinery
in Japan, and with it the cheap labor
of Japan is to be set to work. In
dustry in Japan will be organized in
the highly efficient manner .of the
Occident. .'?;' /
The new company has started
already the manatacture of steel,
celuloid and silk. Other industries
will be started as soon as the necess
ary captial is obtained. — Press Review.
An Essay on Babies,
The Physical • Culture 'Magazine
gives the following: i ..-".-...'
A funny man evidently, a bachelor,
has written ■ an essay, on babies.
"Babies," hhre r writes, "are usually
young. Now and ' again specimens
may be found of twenty years and
over. Real, live, unmistakable,
heard-a-mile-off  babies are always
young. ."■. ■
"Babies have features. .With a good
microscope ..you , can . see a baby's
nose. It has a forehead, .one that.goos
over to the back of its neck. A baby.'a.
ears are put on,, for .. amusement;
solely to relieve its great expanse of
cheek. The places -where, its ..eyer
brows ought to be are there, but. the
eyebrows have not _ arrived, .which
gives rise. to a suspicion that .. babies
are bare-faced creatures. .■• ,>.■ .,• 
"A baby has eyes, which eyes ,-it
chiefly uses to express astonishment
—evoked no doubt by the antics and
language of those about. It has a
mouth, too, which it keeps for putt
ing its hands and feet into, together
with keys, pencils,' coins, "pieces of
coal, and other odds and ends it may
find lying about. A baby's' mouth is
by far the most useful- of its posses
sions. •■' ■'•: :■■/•'','■■• ■ .r;V
"Babies wear clothes'. The -chief
object aimed at in dressing ; a baby
is to lose the baby among the clothes.
If you have a foot and a half or two
feet of baby you will require, from
forty to fifty yards of clothes to -dress
it properly, v, The reason for. this is
that every baby is tbe best baby that
ever was born, and the . fact must be
emphasized. Besides, someboby might
wish to steal it, and- in such a case the
longer the thief had. to look for ■it
the greater wouldbo the chance ;of
catching him.- .-.- > , • <

News Clipped From
Our Exchanges
Last Sunday afternoon James Jen
kins and Malcolm Cowan faced death
in the shaft of the black Hawk mine,
near 1 Soulsbyville. They had placed
fuses, five feet in length, in nine
loaded holes, and after spitting them
they climbed upon the rim of. the
bucket, holding on to the cable, and
signalled .the engineer to hoist.
When they bad ascended a distance
of about thirty, feet, for some un
accountable reason the bncket came
to a sudden stop. Hardly had it
ceased its motion -before Cowan was
out of it, and climbing- up the ladder
in a race to get beyond the zone ot
the spitting fuses that were sending
fire to the dynamite in the holes.
Jenkins, trusting perhaps that the
engine would soon start up again,
held to the' bucket. Before Cowan
had time to climb five rounds, there
was an explosion below, and the
jagged and broken rock was Lulled
up the shaft and around the two un
fortunates. The bucket and Jenkins
being below Cowan they sheltered
him from the rocks, and be escaped
unhurt the shock of the discbarge.
Jenkins was unfortunate. His left
leg from midway of the knee down
ward, was torn and mangled and the
bones broken in half a dozen places
and protruding through the flesh at
the ankle. The right leg fared no
better, it being almost pulverized
from knee to foot, and the heel en
tirely torn away. When the engine
'was again started and the bucket
reached the surface, Jenkins was
found in the bottom of it. He was
brought to the home of his mother
near Sonora. 'Dr Bromley is exerting

to "prevent blood-poisoning. At

"What has become of the old-fash

to drive delivery wagons and work

In a Trance.
lor more than six weeks Mrs. S. A.
Uriffin, of Boulder.Colorado, has lain
in a trance. Her physicians-. agree
that they think she is living mentally
in another world. She was conscious
of her stay here a short time a few
days ago and said :
"1 have seen heaven. On my jour
ney I stood first on a plain so deso
late.so immense, that even now I can
not bear to contemplate it. Phantoms
flocked all about me, all silent, ail
restless, but all journeying as was I
across that dreary plain. At last I
seemed to be enfering a building of
the most imposing dimensions. It
was too beautiful for words. I en
tered a great hall. Six judges sat
there, presided over by a seventh, who
was superior to them all, and a be
nign, kindly-faced being. He looked
upon me with tender compassion, and
I knew then that I had seen the Kuler
of the Universe."
As Mrs. Urittin was speaking her
voice sank until her words were hard
ly distinguishable. As she finished
she sank again into a death-like slum
ber. There is no sign of returning
consciousness.

by the death of our esteemed sister
and friend, Addie Biilalon, and in
loving memory of the departed, who

CITY OFFICIAL PAPER.
FRIDAY.. MARCH 2, 1906
The Cost of County Government.
It is well to impress upon the
public mind from time to time what
it cost to run the local machinery of
government. Few people realize the
amount of money that is raised from
all sources to meet the expenses of
Amador county. Property holders,
of course, know from experience
that of late years there has been a
gradual prooess of increased ' assess
ments, and at the same time not a
corresponding decrease in the tax
rate. This resnlt is brought forcibly
to their mind when they make their
annual or semi-annual pilgrimage
to settle their bills at the tax col
lector's office, finding as they have
been in the habit of doing, that it
usually takes more coin to settle tbe
claim than it did the preceding year.
Still, this fact,, significant in itself,
does not give an adequate idea of the
vast sums expended annually in
moving the governmental machinery.
To bring this forcibly to the atten
tion of the people, we have compiled
from the auditor's books the follow
ing table showing the revenue each
month from all sources tor the year
July - - - - ■-':', 6616 35
$159,034 05
Of this amount over 827,200 went
into the state treasury as Amador 's
share for the support of the state
government. Deducting this sum
from the total revenue we have a
balance of $131,831, as the sum called
for to support our county organiz
ation. This amounts to an average
of Sl2 per head for every man, woman
and child within the boundaries of
the oounty. If every inhabitant were
a taxpayer, and the expenses of
government were apportioned equally
per head, it would require every
resident to contribute SI per month
to meet the exactions of the local
administration. Suppose the burden
were so distributed, a man having a
family of wife and four children
would be called upon to pay on an
average of SO per month for the
privileges of government, which
would be equal to a month's wages
every year— one-twelfth of a miner's
gross earnings, assuming that he
worked every day in the year. We
simply mention this to emphasize the
situation. The burden is not dis
tributed per capita. The majority of
the population pay nothing directly
to this cost. The entire burden falls
upon about one-fifth of the popula
tion, which would make tbe tax
paying class contribute an average
of 35 per month for county expenses.
In the face of all this we are told
by some that the conuty will bear
comparison with any other portion
of Calitornia in point of economy of
government. Few property holders
will coincide with such a declaration.
It may do for non-taxpayers to preach
such stuff. If the burden of taxation
were quadrupled it would mean
nothing to them, and they could
with equal grace talk in the same
strain. But those who feel the
weight of the subject entertain
totally different views. They realize
that measures to relieve the situation
are imperatively demanded, and that
a radical change in the system of
revenue and expenditures is necessary
to that end.
The Calaveraa Prospect suggests
Leonard S. Calkins, of tbe Nevada
Transcript Miner, as an available
candidate for the republican nomina
tjon for congress in the first district.
Mr Calkins, however, in his editorial
columns announces that be is* not a
candidate, and strongly favors W. F.
Knglobiiglit of Nevada City for the
nomination. Mr Englebright is a
mining enigneer, and thoroughly
conversant with tbe mining interests
of the district, having spent many
years in tbe banner mining county of
the state — Nevada. The republicans
of Nevada county seem to have
centered on him, as the most suitable
man to present to the convention,
and will energetically press his
claims from now on. With the with
drawn of our present efficient con
gressman, J. N. Oillett, on account
of being a candidate for governor,
the mining section is certainly en
titeld to first consideration, and
Nevada having long held the foremost
place in gold production, it is claimed
that she has solid ground to expect
recognition at this time. However,
there will probably be a number of
aspirants for the honor. The district
is strongly republican, and the
nomination by that party is concedod
to be almost equivalent to an eloc-

Good Roads.
A State convention recently met in
Sacramento in the interest of good
roads. How to solve this question is
probably among tbe hardest pro
blems, not only in California, but
also in every other state in the Union.
It is not only a knotty question to
day, It has been the same in genera
tions past, and no doubt will con
tinue to be so for generations to
come. We take no stock in the
solution of this matter by politicians,
and it is safe to assume that most of
those who assembled to discuss it
were of the political, if not of the
office-holding class. Among other
recommendations on this proposition,
they resolved that a system ot state aid
should be inaugurated in this state,
similar to tbe plan tried in some of
the eastern states, with, it is claimed,
marked success. That is to say, the
state should furnish a large portion
of tbe money to build the main
thoroughfares in all tbe counties, if
not actually take charge of the con
struction and maintenance of such
highways. This would mean a vast
accession to the army of state officials,
and also an immense increase in the
expenses of running the state govern
ment. It would mean a dual set of
road officials — one under state and
the other under county control. We
take little stock in the new fangled
method. We do not believe under
the conditions prevailing in Cali
fornia that it would work an im
provement at all commensurate with
the inoreased expense. It is some
what remarkable that no mention was
made of the most objectionable
feature of the present road system of
tbe state— namely, the supervision
and actual working control of the
roads in the hands of the supervisors.
The body that passes upon and allows
the road bills is composed of the
identical men who contract the bills
for road work. In plain work, the
supervisor of each district as road
commissioner, incurs all the expense
of road maintenance, and thereafter
with his brother supervisors passes
upon the bills which he has contracted
in this behalf.- We are not arguing
against the practice in this conuty
particularly. The supervisors of
Amador county are fully tip to the
average of those in other counties as
regards ability and integrity. We
simply refer to the system as a bad
one. Good roads at any practicable
cost may be looked for in vain while
such a system is in vogue. But this
crying evil— one which has been cry
ing in clarion tones for redress
thougboat the state for many years,
and crying in vain— was passed over
in silence by the recent convention.
This fact tends to discredit this
particular move in a worthy cause.
Good roads are the mere dream of
visionaries under .existing circum
stances.

Raid on Canines.
Tuesday was the liveliest day in the
dog line that Jackson has ever ex
perienced. Jackson, the city marshal
had a couple of men deputized to
corral all stray untagged dogs. By
noon there were fully twenty dogs
in the corral, several of them belong
ing to prominent citizens of the
town. A number were redeemed as
soon as the owners found out that
their pet canines were in limbo. It
cost 53.25 to liberate each dog after
getting in tho pound. The deg
catcher is entitled to 25 cents for each
animal, the poundmaster is authoriz
ed to charge 25 cents per day tor
feeding, and a penalty of 81 is added
to the tax. About 100 dog licenses
bad been issued up to Tuesday nigbt,
making over §200 as tbe sum collected
from this source of income. Tho
main advantage is that a lot of worth
less animals, which were really a
standing nuisance, have disappeared
from the streets. Tbe impounded
dogs have to be kept five days, at tbe
expiration of which time they will be
destroyed. The expense of mainten
ance of dogs so kept and destroyed
will fall upon tbe city treasury.
Some discussion has naturally
arisen as to tbe extent of the author
ity of the poundmaster in corralling
dogs. It seems to be settled that a
dog, cannot be interfered with by
the officer unless he is on the streets
or public property. Private property
cannot be invaded tor the purpose of
capturing an unlicensed dog, neither
is it permissable to endeavor to
entice an animal off private grounds
for the purpose of impounding him.
A dog may be kept chained up or
confined to the owner's premises
without being subject to the license
tax.
Married in San Francisco.
Henry Lasswell, of San Francisco,
formerly of Jackson, and Miss Elena
Pearl of San i<rancisco, were married
by Father Jose, of Our Lady Gauda
lupe church, in San Francisco on
February 18tb. Miss Marion Gilson
of Oakland, a particular friend of the
bride, acted as bridesmaid, and
Walter Herrick of Oakland, cousin of
the groom, was best man. Only a few
friends and relatives of the contract
ing parties were invited to witness the
ceremony. After the service the
happy couple were driven to the
groom's sister's Mrs F. Hewitt at 118
east Juniper street, where a wedding
dinner was served. Many beautiful
presents were received by the bride.
The guests present were: Mr and Mrs.
F Santa Cruz; Mr and Mrs J. Lowen

An Extra Power Line.
The Standard Klectrio Company is
erecting an additional pole line from
Electra to Sutter Creek. iSome Hf
teen men are working building the
line. It will run through Jackson
slightly to the west of tbe town
proper, but within the city limits.
The line was commenced last Friday,
and will be pushed to completion
as soon as possbile. It is intended
merely as a reserve line to be called
iuto requisition in case of a break
in the other line. As . soon as any
interruption in the current is dis
covered on the line in use, it will be
tbe work of a few seconds to shift to
the otber line. In this way any pro
longed interruption of the trans
mission of either light or power be
tween Electra and Sutter Creek is
next to impossible. Even in case of
an accident at tho power house at
Electra the current can be sent here
from other generating stations of
the Standard Company. This is a
decided boon to the mines of this
section, and tbe residents of the
towns along tbe mother lode.

An Old Resident Dies.
:I<VA. Serine, an old resident of
Pino Grove, died in Unit town on tbe
morning of February 28. lie bad
been a sulf erer for many months, and
had been unable from rbeumatic
troubles to move around except by
artificial methods. From infancy be
was afflicted with a tumor on tbe
front part of tbe neck which attained
an enormous size. It perhaps might
have been safely removed by a surg
ical operation in the early stages of
its growth, but after he had attained
to man's estate, and the tumor had
reached really mammoth proportions
it was deemed impracticable to
attempt its removal with the knife.
.The funeral took place yesterday in
the cemetery at Pine Urove. Deceased
was a native of New York, 75 years
of age. He leaves a wife and two
daughters, both married, Mrs J. H.
Werly and Mrs Tarr. v ;-
First Criminal Cases.
The city recorder, W. J. Thomp
son, was called upon last Wednesday
to act in tho first criminal prosecu
tions which have come to his official
notice. F. W. Parker, the night
watchman, arrested two men, named
Clark and Day, on a charge of
vagrancy. They were soliciting alms
on the , street. It was a state law
under which they wore arrested.
Justice Goldner was sick at the time,
so they were taken before the city
recorder. Both pleaded guilty, and
were given ten days each in county
jail. The question arises, is the
county or the city responsible for the
costs in these cases? The solution of
that proposition will have an im
portant bearing upon the expenses of
tbe city government. No doubt the
recorder will look. to the city for his
fees, the county pays a salary, and
cannot reimburse the city magistrate
in such cases. And probably the
city will also have to stand the cost
for keep of the prisoners in the
county jail— 7s cents each per day.

One would think tbe laxative idea
in a cough syrup should have been
advanced long before it was. It.
seems the only rational remedy for
coughs and colds would be to move
the bowels and clean the mucus

the same time. Kennedy's Laxative
Honey and Tar does this. It is the

MINING NOTES.
Mitchell— The mill has been operat
ing onlyilve stamps since the break
ing of the shaft mentioned last week
the, shaft being too short to permit
of the full ten stamps being used.
This reduced capacity will continue
until a new cam shaft can be got from
San Franciscio. The mine gives
employment to between ten and
twenty men, when in full swing, and
is reported to be looking well.
Wheeler Gravel Mine— This mine,
located within the towiisite of Pine
Grove is running by hydraulic pro
cess, and has been in operation for
several weeks. It gives employment
to five or six men. Nothing can be
said at present as to probable yield,
as no clean-up has been, or will be,
made until the end of the season.
Climax— This little mine in the
vicinity > of Weiland is proving a
liberal gold producer. The rich ore
continues, and the company gives
employment to some thirty men.
Jose Gulch— This property located
at Butte City is being operated with
a force from five to eight men. A
tunnel has beon run a distance of 400
feet, which' has tapped the ledge at a
depth of 300 feet from the surface.
The mill is being put in order for
active work. F. M. Farwell of San
Francisco, who is largely interested
in the company, ai-rived here Wed
nesday on a visit of inspection. He
intends to remain a tew days.
Treadwell— This mine, which is
being operated under the management
of a gentleman named Drake, is said
to be looking well. It is situated in
Sutter Creek about eight miles east
of the town of that name. They
have been doing development work
for some time, and the prospects are
so encouraging that bids have been
called for the erection of a ten stamp
mill.
The tailings plant erected by Chase
and Boydson on Jackson creek half a
mile below town, has not been oper
ated lately, owing partly to the high
water. An expert in such plants is
expected from Colorado shortly, .to
inspect the plant, and rectify, any
little defects that may exist therein.
Such works have proved a paying
investment in Colorado camps, and
there seems no reason why they
should not be fully as successful here,
especially on Jackson creek, whore it
is estimated that fully SIOOO per day
escapes in the tailings from the
several mills! and goes down the
creek. To secure even five per cent
of this lost gold would make the
venture a profitable one.' ;
Another Mysterious Fire.
The Kennedy company have been
constructing for some time past a
now boarding bouse, consisting of
two separate buildings, one for the
dining room and cooking depart
ments, and tbe other for sleeping
accommodations. The new structures
are separated only by a narrow pass
age way, and are between the north
and east shafts. They are practically
completed, and ready for occupancy,
and some of the furniture has been
moved from the old to the new
quarters. Last Monday morning, as
Geo. Asbury, who is employed in
hauling the sulphurets from the mill
to the culorination works was driving
past the new buildings, he saw a
column of smoke issuing from the
lower or south side of the diniug
room building. He went to investig
ate, and found that the place was on
fire, and the flames had gained such
headway that in a few seconds more
serious damage would have resulted.
With sasistance, the fire was extin
guished after burning a hole in tbe
flooring big enough for a man to get
through and scorching considerable
of the woodwork. The lower side
stands somewhat from the ground,
and it is supposed that during Sun
day night a candle had been malici
ously placed under the flooring, and
the fire started in that manner. The
general opinion is that it was the
work of an incendiary. The officers
were notified and went out to in
vestigate, but no clue to the eluci
dation of the affair has been dis
covered. Why anyone should seek
to destroy the more convenient, and
roomy boarding house is not easy of
explanation. f.

City Survey.
John Brown completed the field work
of survoying the exterior boundaries
of the city ot Jackson yesterday. ' He
commenced the work six weeks ago
with three assistants. The weather
has interfered with' the -work con
siderably, so that only twenty or
twenty-one days waro charged for.
Iron stakes have bean placed at every '
forty acres corner, and driven
into tne ground at such a depth that
they will not be likely to be dis
placed. The completion of this work
dispenses with the services of tho
three assistants. The surveyor him
self has considerable office work to
do, but whether outside of his con
tract at 85 per , day, or included
therein, we do not know.

THE AMADOR LEDGER: JACKSQK, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. MARCH 2, 1906.
"Only He."
There may be a world of pathos and
even of rebuke in a very few words,
and so the rather thoughtless wife of
a contributor of ours discovered recent
ly. She has two sweet little children,
both girls, and, almost without know
ing it, she made a pet and favorite
of the younger and prettier child.
"Sweet," as she called her, had every
care and attention lavished upon her,
and good natured neglect was more or
less the portion of the elder.
The mother was sitting in her bed
room quietly reading recently when the
soft patter of tiny feet sounded on the
stairs.
"Is that you, Sweet?" she called.
"No, mamma," was the sad reply;
"It isn't Sweet— lt's only me!"
That pathetic little "Only me!" haunt
ed the wife of our contributor for long
er than she would have cared to admit,
but a change has since marked Her
treatment of her eldest born.— London
Tit-Bits. ;C
Enffllsli Name*.
Puzzling enough to an American is
the English fashion of spelling a name
one way, and pronouncing It in quite
another, but the cities are even worse
than the Individuals, since they deliber
ately adopt some alias. The town of
Hull, for Instance, is Klngston-on-Hull.
It has no official recognition as any
thing else, yet as Hull it is known to
nine out of ten, who would wonder If
Klngston-on-Hull was near the town of
Hull should they hear it mentioned.
Even supposedly respectable cathedral
towns are not above hiding identity,
and to call New Sarum "Salisbury" is
to give it its alias. The royal town of
Windsor is really New Windsor, and
the county of Hampshire, popularly
shortened to Hants, is in reality the
county of Southampton. Bradford-by
the-Sea is more correctly Morecambe,
but rightly Foulton Ie Sande, while
Bridllngton, sometimes called Burling
ton, is more popularly Wakefleld-by-the-
Sea.
Deadly Trade*.
"Tobacco workers are prone to dead
ly nerrous diseases. I have never yet
seen a tobacco worker who Is not a
nervous crank, who Is not off In his
head," complained the owner of a large
cigar factory. "I don't know why It
(s. I used to be a worker myself, and
I have never recovered from the effects
of the trade. Half the time my men
are aw*y sick or dying, they ace al
ways 1U tempered and flighty, and a
public agitation makes Idiots of them. I
don't know the reason, as I said." He
was advised to consult a physician and
find out
The foreman of a stonecuttlng yard,
when questioned, was better Informed
as to the evils of his trade.
"See those dust clouds all over the
yard?" he said. "Consumption there!
And quick, at that"— Technical World.
Bin Measurements.
To measure corn find number of cu
bic feet In crib, then multiply by 9 and
divide by 20, which gives the amount In
bushels. To determine amount of shell
ed corn to b« obtained from crib of
corn in ear find cubic feet of corn,'di
vide by 2, and the product will be the
number of bushels of shelled corn, as
two cubic feet of corn If sound and dry
will produce one bushel of shelled corn.
To find the number of bushels of ap
ples, potatoes, etc., in a bin multiply
the length, breadth and thickness to
gether and this product by 8 and point
off one figure hi the product for deci
mals.—lowa State Register and Farmer.
A Dilemma.
A well known college professor offers
the two horns of a dilemma to advo
cates of coeducation. .
"If you lecture to twenty boys and
twenty girls In the same room," he
asks, "will the boys attend to the lec
ture or to the girls?"
Of course the coeducatlonlst, to be
consistent, must say that they will
listen to the lecture.
"Well, If they do, !> replies the dean,
"they are not worth lecturing to."—

Hoaelea.
Many muscles are located at a con
siderable distance from the point where
their force Is to be exerted and are
connected with the point of operation
by slender strings or tendons. This Is a
provision of nature solely for conven
ience. If all the muscles whose power
Is concentrated In the hand and foot
were located In the hands or feet these
members would assume an inordinate
size and weight and become more trou
blesome than useful.
Hlrabean'a Trumpet Voice.
Mlrabeau had a voice like a trumpet,
and when he raised It In threat or de
nunciation the effect was awe inspir
ing. The Impression he created was
greatly heightened by his manner, his
personal appearance being exceedingly
Imposing. He had a way of lifting his
head and shaking It to give emphasis
to his periods that made the beholders
Involuntarily draw back with fear.
Temporarily Silenced.

/L-' ■ : °y hasty meals,

toms which have been warning him a
year past, that his stomach was failing
in its duties."
The symptoms of a disordered stomach
arc, among others, variable appetite, sour
risings, heartburn, undue fullness after
eating, dull headache, dingy complexion,
discolored eye, fluctuations in physical
strength, nervousness, sleeplessness de-
pondency. No person will have all these
symptoms at once.
The restoration of the stomach to sound
health, begins with the first dose of Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. The
cure progresses until the functions of the
stomach are in healthy operation. Then
the nerves are quiet and strong, the ap-
petite healthful, the sleep restful, the eye
bright, the complexion clear.

which my child received from your medi-

GIFTED POLISH ACTRESS.
MADAME BERTHA KALICH IS
WINNING FAME IN ENGLISH'
SPEAKING PARTS
Unfamiliar With English Language
Six Years Ago, she , Has Now
Mastered Our Speech— One of a
Race to Produce t'amuus . Haycrs*.
\V.th so much' iaterest focused on
happenings in Hussia, it would be
strange indeed if we did not receive a
taste of Russian drama. The leading
cities of the country are now centering
their attention upon the Russian play,
"Monna Vanna" the title role of which
is being essayed by Madame Bertha
Kalich,. a Polish actress who won fame
in the Yiddish theatres on the Bowery
in New York City.
Madame Kalich may not be considered
a beautiful woman but through the nat
uralness of her acting she touches every
spark of humanity that glows in -the
human breast. Six years ago she did
not know a word of English, yet her
mastery at the present time of one of
the most difficult of all speaking
tongues, is remarkable. Not only does
♦*• speak English well but she Is fam
i-uj with, five other languages — Ger-
Ean, Polish, Russian, French and Yid
dish." For years, she has been acting
at the Russian and Hebrew theatres
of New York City. Her first appearance
in an ] English speaking play was a
year or so ago when she played the
name ..part in "Fedora." Her earlier
r^rformances were disappointing but
st t.he end of a fortnight she made a
T;?-found Impression upon her audience.
So far this is the story of . Monna Vanna
for the American people are not ac
customed to the mannerisms and act
ing of the Russian plays.
Madame Bertha Kalich is tall and
of the brunette type usual to the He
brew, with eyes that while most expres
sive, can hardly be said to be winning.
She cannot be classed as beautiful,
but her art has a mimicry which is
sure to bring fame to her. Critics lay
great faith in her possibilities as an
actress. They believe that after thor
ough schooling on the American stage,
the requirements of which are far "dif
ferent from those of the Russian, she
' will become famous, for she comes of
a race which has achieved wonders.
And when we encounter marked talent
in the Hebrew race no one living can
predict how many rungs of the ladder of
fame may be traversed successfully. The
greatest actors, not only of the present
age but of the past, have been and
are Jews. Of the women we have from
Rachel to Bernhardt, and the men
range from Dawison to Edwin Booth,
while passing reflections may be given
to the ability of David Garrick, Mrs
Siddons and a host of others in whose
veins were some drops of Oriental
blood.
Bertha Kalich's appearance in Chi
cago was greeted with an outburst of
enthusiasm which continued through
out the many weeks of her perform
ance there. Such a well-known critic as
W. H. Hubbard of the Chicago Tribune
in reviewing "Monna Vanna" and its
leading actress, said, "Madame Kalich
is enrolled in the list of great artists.
She is now an actress of peculiar and
jncommonly attractive qualities and
gives every promise of becoming in a
few seasons one of the most notable
women on the American stage. Watch
ing her during the week has brought
r-onviction that she is the possessor
of remarkable talents, and that these
talents are susceptible of a developing
and shaping which can but place her
high in the esteem of a large class
of the best theatre-goers and add an
other great artist to the small list of
really gifted players that our stage
can boast. 9he has the power indis
pensable to any artist who is to endure
and whose work is to be of any wide
reaching Influence — the power to at
tract the public

TRAPPERS' PROSPEROUS TIMES.
Furs Worth More Now Than For
Past 1 hirty Years. ... . y, ,
The many trappers operating along
the northern boarder will reap a rich
harvest the present . winter, meaning
many comforts, even luxuries, in the
log cabins of scores of sturdy settlers
in the wilds of the northern country,
who are mainly dependent, upon' their
traps during the cold months for a
livelihood. *4^- .| -v
The settlers and professionals in the
country directly tributary to the Great
Lakes look to mink, marten and otter
to make their trapping operations
profitable, and the pelts of these little
animals at present command a higher
price than at any time during the past
thirty years, while there has been a
decided slump in the prices paid for
furs from the black, blue and silver
fox which bring only »50 each now,
where a year or two ago they were as
[high as $300 apiece., «r-i ■■«,~« ,~
Last wl:.ter $4.50 was considered a
good price for a mink. pelt, . and it
wasn't more than a season or two back
that. 52.50 was. the highest paid for a
single pelt of this kind. Now a choice
raw mink fur will bring $11, and a mar
ten pelt from $18 to $20, where $6 or $7
was paid last winter. .An otter skin is
worth $22 . just as it comes from the
trapper's hands, which Is away, above
any price paid for more than thirty
years. | Quite a . few. fisher are caught
through northern Minnesota and these
are worth from $8 to $10. 1 Beaver are
very scarce in this state. They are
worth from $7 to $9 each. . ' < .
The higher prices paid for furs will
also prove a boon to . the Minnesota
MADAME BERTHA KALICH
Indians, or such of them at least as"
have any business ability. A good
many of the Indians trap during the
winter, but the trouble with the major
ity of them is that they do not know
the value of t^eir catch and are likely
to sell a $22 otter pelt for $4 or $5, and
a $11 mink pelt for a dollar, or perhaps
a pint of whiskey. The white man is
well aware of this fact, and some a
gents make it their business during the
winter to do nothing but buy furs of
the Indians, selling them later at a
handsome margin of profit. • :
These agents usually travel from re
servation to reservation by dog team
or snow shoes.
Even the little weasel, scores of
which daily leave their tiny tracks
In the snow on the outskirts of the
towns are worth $1 each for their pelts.
They were valueless three years ago,
and two years ago were worth 10 cents
each. For a time last winter the pelts
brought 50 ' cents each. The weasel
also belongs to the homologue of the
American sable together with the mar
ten, mink, fisher and otter. . The Ameri
can sable really is the marten, accord
ing to some authorities. It is common
ly called the pine marten, and at first
glance the only distinguishing feature
between it and the mink Is a spot of
beautiful orange color on its throat,
just under the chin.X • i\-
A grizzly bear skin is worth, s4o, if
in the best condition, but . of course
grizzly bears are j unknown in the
Lake Region. Many black bears are,
trapped and shot, however, by settlers,
Indians and trappers.
Woman's Sweet Will.
■ On a pillar preeted in Canterbury,

To *<em the tr>ir<>Tit of n woman's will;

JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY, CAL., MAR. 2, 1906.
UNCLE SAM'S SECOND NAVY
GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS A
' TRAINING SCHOOL FOR
REVENUE OFFICERS.
Plenty of Work and Study-Lack of
Social j Events a t>amre of This
Governmental School.— Daily Ke
fiime of the Cadets.
Uncle Sam has one governmental
school which, 'while little known, is
well worthy to rank with West Point
and Annapolis in the thoroughness oi
the mental and physical training
which it gives its graduates. Tnis un
heralded educational institution is lo
cated at Arundel Cove on Chesapeake
Bay, about six miles from the city of
Baltimore, and its purpose is to pre
pare for their profession the cadets or
future . commissioned officers of the
United States Revenue Cutter Service.
It is only within a few years that the
general public has been awakening
to a realization of the opportunities
and advantages open to an officer in
Uncle Sam's "police force of the sea,"
in consequence of which, there has
been of late a marked increase in the
applications for admission to the cadet
school.. Any young man not less than
IS nor more than 25 years of age and
not less than S feet 3 inches in height
is, if unmarried, eligible to appoint
ment as a cadet, but no persons should
delude themselves with the Idea that
it is. easy to get into the cadet corps,
for ;the entrance examinations are
quite as severe as those at either West
Point or Annapolis. 
However, all the examinations for
the selection of cadets are strictly com
petitive. js Political and social ; influ
ences ar.e entirely eliminated and this
is unquestionably the most democratic
school under the government • The
cadet spends three years at the train
ing school, each summer being devoted
to a 1a 1 practice cruise on a bark-rigged
vessel during which the young men get
a taste of all kinds of sea duties and
incidentally store up good health for'
the academic year, which extends from
October to May. •• -..■■_■ .
The pay. of a cadet is $500 a year
and a ration of 30 cents a day, out of
which allowance he is r^uired to pur
chase uniforms and textbooks and
meet his mess expenses. The sum of
$10 per month is also withheld from
the pay of each cadet in order that
upon graduation he can purchase the
uniform and outfit of a commissioned
officer. When the cadet graduates he
receives a commission as a third lieu
tenant in the Revenue Cutter Service
at a salary of $1,400 per year. Three
promotions will bring him to the rank
of captain with $2,500 salary per year
and an Increase of ten per cent, for
each five years' service.
A Strenuous Life. ,
The cadets at the training school on
Chesapeake Bay lead a strenuous ex
istence. They "turn out" at 6:30
o'clock in the morning and after half
an hour allowed for. dressing, report
for drill which continues for forty-five
minutes ere the call for breakfast is
given, j From 9 until 12.30 o'clock
there are periods of study and recita
tion, then half an hour for recreation
before dinner, which is served from
one to two o'clock. In the afternoon
there is more study and recitation
with forty-five minutes' drill. Half an
hour before supper and one hour after
supper are allowed for amusement and
then from 7 to 9 comes another study
period. An hour of "skylarking"
closes the day and the cadets turn in
at 10 o'clock.
During the three year interim the
future Revenue Cutter officers acquire
a wide range of book learning includ
ing mathematics, English, history,
law, hygiene, seamanship, engineer-
Ing, astronomy,- chemistry, civil gov
ernment, etc. Incidentally muscle
building is looked after by means of the
"setting up" and other athletic drills
While the officers in charge of the
training school for Revenue Cutter ca
dets fully realize that all work and no
,play makes for dullness, no such prom-
inence is given to social features as is
the case at the academies at Annapolis
and West Point. The Revenue Cutter
cadets are at liherty on Saturday af
ternoons and these half holidays are
usually devoted to "hops," hut aside
from these functions and such merry
making as can be crowded into the two
weeks' vacation in the autumn or the
vacation of one week in the spring, the
young men apply themselves jretty
icloeely to their studies.
BALDWIN'S NEW AIRSHIP.
Believed by Experts to Surpass any
Flying Mdcnine Yet Constructed.
Captain Thomas Baldwin believes
he has found a way to navigate the air
with fair success. • Captain Baldwin,
be it known, is - America's . foremost
aeronaut, having been engaged in the
profession of sailing to the clouds
longer ' and more continuously than
any other citizen of the republic He
began ballooning in the ordinary way
nearly a quarter of 'a century ago.
Then he invented the modern type of
parachute and in his inventing and'ex
perimenting, went from one thing to
another until, he hit unon the dirigible
balloon type of airship". -
.. ...la, the ,. past half decade | Captain
Baldwin, who makes' his honie to Los
Angeles, California,- has built five* dif
ferent sky. craft, all oh thisigeneral
pattern, but each different in many re
spects from its predecessor. He hopes
to improve on even . the new airship
which has recently ' been completed,
but the fact remains that this latest
flying machine is so far superior to
everything that has gone before it that
it is well worthy of notice. .
I In the new airship the gas bag or
balloon which lifts it has a,capacity
of 16,000 cubic j feet of gas or nearly
twice as much as f"> bag of the one
which Captain Baldwin exhibited at
the St. Louis Exposition. . It is made
of Japan silk, oiled Inside and out.
From this bag there Is suspended by
means of a net of cotton seine twine a
framework which contains the pro
pelling and steering apparatus of the
airship and . which is known as the
"keel." In Captain Baldwin's j earlier
inventions this was built of steel tub
ing and each frame cost $700, but in
the new airship the keel is of Oregon
spruce, the lightest j and strongest
wood in' existence.- - -
A Powerful Little Engine.
I The. engine which furnishes power
for driving the baloon is located about
midway on the keel. It consists of a
gasoline motor. very similar to those in
use ■on ■ motor-cycles. The motor
weighs about- 75 pounds, is capable of
3,000 revolutions per minute, and
able to develop 7y 2 horsepower, but it
is seldom if ever that so- much energy
is required even when the aerial flyer
is facing a heavy wind.
Attached to the keel at the forward
end of the - airship is the propeller;
which is eleven feet in diameter and
has two 18 inch blades of painted can
vas. These blades whirl around at the
rate of two hundred times per minute,
but it will be observed that. this pro
peller Is at the forward end of the ship
instead of at the stern, where it might
naturally be looked for, and this gives
the keynote to one of Captain Bald
win's most important inventions,
namely, the scheme of having the rap
idly revolving propeller pull the ship
through the air instead 1 of pushing it
as a slrlp is pushed through tha water.
Nearly fifty feet from the propeller,
at tlie other end of the keel is the rud
der by which the steering is accom
plished. This rudder, is about six by
eight feet in size and consists of
canvas stretched upon a wooden
frame. Attached to the framework of
the keel is also a tank which is ca
pable of holding two gallons of gaso
line. The navigator of the new Bald
win airship has nothing in the way of
a platform on which to stand, . but
must balance himself on the skeleton
framework of the keel, bracing himself
by means of the net which suspends
the keel from the gas bag.
Baldwin's new airship cost him more
than $1,800 and by reason of the gas
required to inflate it as well as other
expenses, each ascension costs in the
neighborhood of $250. The hydrogen
gas which is employed to lift the t-a I
loon and to maintain it in a position
where the propeller can do its work is
manufactured , by combining iron
filings or borings'^ sulphuric acid and
water on the basis of one part acid
and one part iron to -four parts water.
This gas is generated in a big tank

THE NATION'S FORESTS.
BRILLIANT ADDRESS AT ANNUAL
CONVENTION AMERICAN FOR
ESTRY ASSOCIATION.
Secretary Wilson Sounds -Warning
Note on Forest Destruction— Million
Acres Should Be , Tree-planted—
; Everett Hale In Vigorous S lee 1.
Secretary Wilson has more than
once manifested a deep interest in the
question of American ■ Forestry. Mr.
Wilson has, in fact, for some years been
elected and re-elected President of the
American Forestry Association, a pow
erful organization, composed of publio
pirited men throughout the country,
wnich' has probably done more j than
any other one influence to awaken
national- interest -in : ; the 'enormous
destruction of the forests and the neces
sity for their business-like management
and preservation, even to the reforest
ation of denuded areas and the plant
ing of trees upon barren prairie lands.
That the 'movement In" the United
States ' is coming, to be considered an
important one is to some extent evi
denced by the increased recognition of
the subject by Congress, which is also
due largely to Secretary Wilson's en
thusiasm. When Mr. Wilson was ap
pointed Secretary of Agriculture by
President McKinley, his forestry ' di
vision consisted . of one forester,' an
assistant forester and five clerks and
with an annual appropriation from
REV. EDWARD EVERETT HALE,
Congress for forestry of $30,000. Since
then forestry, division has been advanc
ed into a separate bureau of the Depart
ment of Agriculture, employing over
500 men and having an annual appro
priation from Congress of upwards of
one-half a million . dollars. Fully - a
million acres of forest lands in the
eastern part of the United States have
been i turned over to • the Bureau of
Forestry for management on a practi
cal and scientific basis which will en
able the cutting of the forest for lum
ber and at the > same time insuring
succeeding "crops" of timber, while
over 100,000,000 of the acres of gover
ment Forest reserves in the west have
also been turned over to the Bureau
of Forestry for administration. It ia
probable that at least another 50,000,
000 acres of public timber land will be
placed in federal reserves. *
Secretary Wilson in his opening ad
dress at the recent annual meeting of
the American Forestry Association in
"Washington, nttered a clear ' note of
warning against the whole-sale reduc
tion of the woodland area in the
country. ,
"No nation on earth is as successful
in the work of destroying its forests as
the United States," he declared. "The
indiscriminate mutilation of the forests
must be stopped; the matter has be
come one of national interest which
can not much longer be ignored by the
people or by our legislators."
After advocating the broadest kind
of protective forest policy, he touched
on the subject of reforesting certain
sections. He thought that every day
should be an arbor day, that every year
should mark a notable advance in the
effort to recover lost ground.
Plant A KUlion Acres.
"We should 'plant," he said, "not 10,
000 acres nor stop at 100,000 acres,
but shouM plant 1,000,000 acres in
trees, and this would be, .viewed from
several points, the very best investment
which the United States ever made. It
would be a paying, money investment
to the government, and it would be a
tremendous help to our agriculture.
The price of merchantable timber is In
creasing with , great rapidity, while
every one knows the very beneficial
effect that has resulted from the plant
ing of wind-breaks in the prairie
states."
Another address before the Associa
tion by the venerable Edward Everett
Hale, now the' Chaplain of tl: United
States Senate, constituted a clean-cut
statement of the great necessity of
prompt action to protect the forests.
Dr. Hale is around eighty years 01 age;
he remembers when the saw and the ax
had scarce touched the giant monarchs
in Ohio Valley, when the forests of
northern Michigan and Minnesota were
unbroken wildernesses, and when those
of the far northwest," in that marvelous
country "where rolls the Oregon," were
a terra incognita. He has seen whole
states denuded of their valuable timber
and burned over by devastating fires

tion he has left uninvaded. .
At the present rate of timber cutting in
the United States, 40 years from to-day
there win be not an acre left of mer

Common Sei.se Forestry. -
'•What are we going to do?" asked
Dr. Hale In his deep voice. "We must
use both common sense and sentiment
In dealing with the forest question.
It is a very great question. The in
dividuals interested in American for
estry, even though they be millionaires
or multi-millionaires, can not accom
plish anything definite and lasting un
less the states and the general govern
ment can be awakened to the necessity
of giving the cause large and substan
tial assistance which it merits. 1 Com- v
mon sense, in forestry, means that the
forestry question should be put upon'
a business basis. In order to make a
large, immediate profit forests are de
stroyed;, they should be cut with some
reference to the future; in other words
they should be cropped. All the gov
ernments of Europe rely largely upon
their forest lands for revenue. A sim
ilar : condition should and could ba
brought about In this country.- \-^
TEE SUNSHINE SOCIETY.
An Organization Which Brines Gooi*
Cheer Into Darkened Hearts. =S
Among tie many societies organ
teed'by. the generous men and women
ot to-day for the welfare and happi
ness of others, none> has quite so inter
esting a history and unique a charac
ter as the International Sunshine So
ciety. -
It is so broad in -its scope that it
embraces all the charities, yet is In
itself no sense a charity, but an inter
change of kindly greeting - and the
passing on of good cheer, material or
otherwise. ■ Sunshiner* do not labor,
under any rules, but there is always
the personal touch of. sympathy which
means so much to the unfortunate
man or woman to .whom, fate has
seemed unkind. , . '
A more appropriate name could not
have been. found for, the society, the
members of which pledge themselves to »
brijg sunshine into : the . lives of
others; to do something each day to
lighten- someone's' burden; to speak
the cheerful word that may bring new
hope, new life and energy; to take no
tice of the lonely; to do the little acts
of kindness, | thoughtfulness and
Generosity that manifest the human,
sympathetic interest lin one's fellow
creatures.-
Opportunities for doing a . kindness
are often lost for lack of thought; the
members of the Sunshine Society
strive to cultivate the habit of sym
pathy that will give i them a keener
grasp and a deeper understanding of_
the lives of those around them.'
The Society is unique In that there
are no salaries paid. . The president
general, every minor officer and mem
ber, gives : his or her services. Even
the necessary clerical work is freely ■
donated. The personal sacrifices that
every officer aid member makes to -
carry on the work cannot be estimated. "
Its Origin and Growth.
The Society was incorporated under
the laws of New York in 1900 and to
day there are 400,000 enrolled mem
bers. : -.. rgJS
The Society Is the outgrowth of a
thought expressed by Mrs. Cynthia
Westover Alden in the office of the
New York Recorder several years ago
during the holiday season. Mrs. Alden
was the recipient of a number of cards
from her co-workers on the paper as
well as outside friends. After enjoy
ing the cards, sl.e protested that she
would have been better pleased if the
donors had not written their names on
them. This statement horrified her
audience and with one accord every
one exclaimed:
"What! You wouldn't give oar pres
ents away, would you?"
"Why not?" was the answer.
"What do you do with yours?" , -
A laughing investigation soon devel
oped the fact that the waste basket
was the ultimate destination of most
of the cards received.
"Let me give you the history of one
pretty ten-cent card that came to me
a year ago," said Mrs. Alden. "It had
an exquisite poem on it, and I enjoyed
it so much that I thought at once of
an old uncle who would appreciate it
and forwarded it to him. He, as I
thought, did enjoy it, and so much
so that he immediately recalled an old
! friend to whom it would appeal with
j special force. So he copied the poem
and sent the card on. This recipient
found the card so helpful that she,
too, felt called upon to pass it on and
before the seven days' holiday was
over the card had carried its Christ
mas message to six different persons.
Of course this is exceptional, but is
still an example of the infinite possi
bilities of a gift accepted in the true
spirit and then passed on, giving each
one the double delight of receiving and
giving."
The cards which had afforded the
little sermon were spread out and were
(Continued on next page.)found to possess many possibilities of
happiness, which the markings spoiled
for passing on. ( J
Inspired with this idea of sending
out remembrances that might be mul
tiplied four-fold a new set of cards
was given to Mrs. Alden by the Re
corder's staff and these cards were at
once sent out The thanks received
for them were so pretty that an item
was made of them in the New York
Recorder. This caused further corre
spondence and resulted in a club for
the exchange of friendly greetings.
The name of "Chat" was at first
chosen for the column, but in time the
membership grew so large that the
mo to "Good Cheer" was adopted and
in 1696 the name of the society was
changed to the "Sunshine" Society,
and its active members were to include
all who were desiross of brightening
life by word, thought or deed.
The growth of the Society has be*>n
almost phenomenal. From the parent
society branches have sprung up until
every State in the Union is represent
ed with regularly enrolled presidents
and organizers.
When a State has ten branches, each
one consisting of at least ten members,
it becomes entitled to a State presi
dent Besides the thousands of mem
bers In the United States, there are
flourishing branches in England, Ja
pan, India, France and Germany.
The Society Motto.
The competition to furnish the So
ciety's motto ran for three months and
PEESIOENT-GCKEKAL ALDEN.
Tiong the many thousands of verses
jcelved the following poem sent in by
Mrs. W. H. Chase o£ Brooklyn was
selected: ' :';
Good Cheer.
Save you had a kindness shown?
Pass it on.
Twas not given for yon alone —
Pass It on.
>et it travel down the years,
fjet it wipe another's tears,
111 in heaven the deed appears—
Pass it on.
At the time the verse was selected
no one knew the author and it was
not for several years after the Society
bad adopted the motto that the writer
was discovered to be Rev. Henry Bur
ton, D. D., of Lytham, England. Mr.
Burton wrote the poem twenty-five
years ago and had almost forgotten it
until the Sunshine Society brought it
into prominence. Mr. Burton is rec
tor of^the Lytham Episcopal Church
and bis become so interested in the
•Society that now everybody in his
church and Sunday school has become
a Sunshlner.
Mr. Burton's parishioners are build-
Ing a beautiful new church and Sun
shiners the world over are planning
to raise funds for a handsome memo
rial window bearing the poem which
has inspired so many to acts of kind
ness and thoughtf ulness.
The Dues.
One of the unique features of the
Society is the payment of membership
fees which . consists merely of some
kind act which will bring "sunshine"
to some one. It may be only an ex
change of books, pictures or flowers, or
it may bring more material benefit. In
one State a well known woman has
paid her dues by educating some boy
as long as she lives instead of placing
a costly monument over her son's
grave. In nearly every State in the
Union the Society owns a wheel chair
given in memory of come dear one.
These are passed around to crippled
and helpless ones and are constantly
in use.
TJhough the Society has never solic
ited funds it is estimated that $100,000
has been given to carry on its work.
From the International headquarters,
96 • Fifth Avenue, New York City,
nearly |60,000 has been expended in
the past five years to make others
happy.
Newspaper Aid.
The newspapers must be given
credit in a large degree for the growth
of the Society. Originating in a news
paper office it has everywhere received
the endorsement of the press until to
day over 200 papers are regularly car
rying Sunshine departments.
The Society has a publication of its
own called the Sunshine Bulletin, of
which Mrs. Alden, the founder and
president-general, is editor.
Features of Sunshine Work.
Each State division of the Sunshine
Society endeavors to have some estab
lished feature besides the- individual
sunshine each member strives to scat
ter. This work takes the form of day
nurseries, homes for crippled children
and aged ones, , maintaining beds in
hospital wards, fresh air and outing
cottages, Sunshine libraries, lunch
rooms for working girls, etc., etc.
The greatest evil the Society has to
contend with is the fake sunshine so
cieties grafters organize to defraud
the public. The popularity of the So
ciety and the ready response that
every appeal of Sunshine receives has
made It possible for these grafters to
reap a rich harvest. Readers should
remember that the only authentic
Sunshine Society has Mrs. Cynthia
Westover Alden as its president-gen
eral and is called the International
Sunshine Society.

As old as is civilization, so old is the
history of the beggar kingdom, for
wherever have been found any collec
tion of men, the beggars there played
their business despite indifference and
the scorn of the majority, yet always
reaping their harvest from the philan
thropic. The nearer one draws to the
warmer countries more and more nu
merous one finds the professional beg
gar. Egypt, India and Italy are the
worst examples. In. countries which
boast of tbeir higher civilization beg
gary flourishes not through want or
privation; but through a ciuss ot peo
ple who make beggary their profes
sion and who have made a line art of
the methods of reaching the soft
hearted. And beggars of this class do
not seem to stop at criminality. * -
A recent case was noted in press
dispatches of unusual brutality prac
ticed by a beggar upon three children
In Austria who had been kidnapped
from their parents. The children tola
a terrible tale of suffering at the hands
of the beggar who had broken their
legs in two places and then twisted
the limbs out of chaps, so that in
knitting together tlio bones would not
set straight. The man sent the chil
dren out to beg for him and their piti
ful condition made compassionate peo
ple give larjre sums because of their
apparent misery.
Fake Deformities.
While a number of the beggars
found in large -^es ' are really de
formed—blind, lame, maimed, crippled,
or deaf and dumb, yet it is a known
fact to the police authorities that there
are establishments -n-Lere idle, worth
less and lazy persons are readily man

way overdrawn as applied to actual
conditions.
A Close Corporation Suit.
Following the example of large 1 cor
porations which form combines for
mutual protection and profit, there
was recently established in New York
a "beggar trust" through the efforts of
a one-legged youth who had left a
comfortable home to enctagre deliber
ately in begging. His remarkable in
sight into business methods would
probably have reaped him a greater
reward -than was derived through beg
gary. Organizing a community of in
terest among the mendicants of Park
Row, he picked out favorable points
throughout the city to which were as
signed certain men. A lime youth
would be placed at one point, a blind
one there and a badly-scalded mendi
cant at another. That these beggars
might not be molested in their work,

Maintenance of a Great Institution
I Through Compulsory Contributions
of Men of the Regular Army.— Has
Beautiful Grounds. . :
The National Soldiers' Home in the
District of Columbia is the only insti
tution of its kind in the United States.
The home was founded March 3, 1851.
The idea of the establishment is said
to have originated with General Win
field Scott, after whom the main build
ing of the Home is named, < and ■ of
whom there is a fine bronze statue in
the grounds. During the occupation of
Mexico General Scott exacted a sum of
money from that country. The money
was paid to him, and he asked Con
gress that it be set aside for the estab
lishment ait Washington of a home for
disabled enlisted men of the regular
navy and army. This was done. The
Home is maintained by exacting from
every enlisted man and officer 12 1-2
cents from each months' pay. Fines
from court martial nnd money due
deserters is turned into this fund. Im
provements at the Home are contem
plated, which call for the expenditure
of over one million dollars. The Home
has on deposit in the Treasury of the
United States a fund of more than two
million dollars. It should be borne in
mind that the Government of the
United States does not contribute one
dollar to the support of this great in
tution. •
No •women are employed at the
Home excepting those in the corps of
trained nurses in the Home hospital.
Much of the work at the home, farm
■work, dairying, gardening^ road main
tenance, housework, cooking, waiting
on table, etc., is done by the inmates,
who are paid for their services out of
the Home fund.
There are about 1,200 veterans in the
Institution. Many of them are civil
war soldiers, some were disabled in
the West Indies, others in the Philip
pines, some in the Indian campaigns,
and some were discharged from the
service for disability incurred in camp
and garrison. Many of the Home
inmatea are mere youths. Every hon

This offer Is limited to Feb. 28., 1906. 'THE FIRE
Someone whispered nervously to a
neighbor. One or two men lifted their
beads and drew quick breaths. People
glancsd from side to side, and a few
feet shuffled uneasily. . Then a tiny
puff of smoke came from the left
wing and travelled as far as the middle
of. the stage. It was followed by a
larger, rolling cloud. The effect was in
*stantaneou3.
"Fire!" shrieked a shrill voice, and
a woman started up frantically. "Fire!
Fire!"
In an instant the huge theatre was
a seething, swaying mass; from all
sides burst screams, sobs, and oaths
For a few seconds people were pushed
in purposeless groups hither and thith
er.- Then suddenly the crowd broke
Into rocking unwieldly sections, each
pushing, fighting, tearing towards the
nearest exit. } .
In the middle of the house, very
still, sat a group of thres. The Woman
was in the middle, the Husband on her
right, the Other Man on her left. For
the first few seconds it seemed ca It
they must be swept off their seats.
Then • with a quick movement , tie
Other Man wheeled half round oa his
chair, put one hand on the back of
the Woman's seat and the other on the
seat before her. The Husband silent
ly followed his example. They were
both big. strong men. Their hands
met in a steady grip behind and in
front of her. Thus till the rush was
over they formed a human cage for
her protection, shunting off by t!ielr
braced rigid frames, their crowding,
frantic neighbors.
'"Thank you," she said quitely, when
the middle of the theatre was deserted.
"I couldn't have borne to be touched
by sueh — animals." She gave a hur
ried glance at the nearest mass of hu
manity and then fixed her eyes whim
sically on the smoke-clouded stage in
front. "What do they remind one of?"
she asked as thcugi thinking aloud.
It was the Other Man who answered
VPigs," he said contemptuously; "pigs,
when the trough h^i Just been filled,
—crowding toward it"
She half turned her head towards
"OH!" SHE CRIED. "YOU'VE HU2T YOUR HAND; IT'S BLEEDING."
him. "Tes," she said gravely; "they
do look like that."
Suddenly the fireproof curtain be- :
gan to move. ;
'•Oh, thank Cod!" shrieked a fashion- ,
ably dressed woman, her face made i
hideous by fear. ;
A sea of other faces, Etarnped with |
every shade of terror ani ferocity, ;
turned towards the staga at the cry. ■
For an instant the tumult sank to some- ;
thing like silence. Hope and thankrul
ness arose in a thousand breasts. Then ;
' the tumult began again.
"It's stuck! Oh. it's stuck!" — and the
fight for life continued in all Its
sickening cowardly savajrery.
"Have we any chance!" asked the !
Woman simply. For a notnett nelthei
►answered. Then again it was the Othei
Man who spoke.
"Unless they get the curtain down
In time, none." he answered.
"There are no other exits; I know
the place well.. It won't be the fire
probably, but the — smoke. In a minute
or two we miust move further back
from it." He spoke with admirable
restraint.
And then suddenly the Husband
stood up. They both turned towards
him. His face was gray, and his lips
trsmbled.
"Net this way," he murmured in a
shaking voi-o, "Ah. merciful heaven,
not again this way! "
The Woman Quivered as beneath a
lash, and her fa"c became drawn.
"Join!" she Fnid eharrfv, "John!"
JTe startel-Bl'-rhtlr. "Yes?"
She would rot let her ovps meet his.
"Pease go, away," she said in a low
VCl"'s.
He hesitated a moment. "What for?"
t>e asked. She stirred impatiently
"On, I don't care. Get a whisky- and
p^ria If you know where to find It. or —
or perhaps you'd better leave out the
soda; I mean " She paused, shud
dering . "Only go," she added faintly.
What did she mean? Did she know
•what she was saying. Probably not,
he decided. What had he Bald himself
a minute ago? He could not remember.
What did anything matter now? He
we^t without a word.
Tho Other Mnn stared straight In
fro it of him. His face, was a masic
For a minute they sat very still. Then
he turned round.
"Come," he said in an ordinary voice,
"it is time to move."
She gave him her hand, and he help
ed her over chairs and wooden forms
till they were at the back of the build
ing. "Here?" she asked.
"No," he said, -and spread hip coat
on the floor; "Here, please. The nearer
the ground, the less smoke, you Unow."
She sat down silently, and motioned
him to share the coat. Then suddenly
3he laughed.
. "It's queer, isn't it," she said, "that
we should think about getting • our
clothes dusty now?"
He did not answer.' He was twisting
a button on hia overcoat round and
round; It came off in his hand. Sud
denly he spoke. "You are very brave."
he said.
She drew a quivering breath. 'Tec
trying to be brave enough for two,"
she said in a low voice. <
He made no reply: he did not want
to understand.
"I'm glad," she added hurriedly,
"that we mcved: Perhaps he will
not find us here."
He turned swiftly, with a rush of
joy. "Elizabeth!" he cried. 
"Then you are content here \ with
me?"
She brushed her hand across her
eyes. "Oh, I don't know what I'm say
ing. I'm angry and distressed and
'I'imiliated. I don't want to die; but
if I've got to, I'd rather be near some
body brave like like you.
"Elizabeth," he said passionately,
"Don't you know ?"
She started. "Oh, hush!" she mur
mured. "It is so near the end."
"That is just why,", he said, and
laughed recklessly. "la a few minutes
it must ail tie over. Haven't we a
right to raaka the most of them? Do
you love me, Elizabeth?" lie drew her
iov.-ar^3 him, and she did not resi3t_
She v,-as thinking shamefacedly of the
grayness of ter husband's face as she
had lact seen it. The blood of a dozen
generations of pioneera and warriors
'.vas surging through her own veins
and she scorned impending fate.
"Tes," she said absently, "I believe
I Co."
"Ah, civ it apain,' ho urged, '"with
out the 'believe' "
The scioke was rapidly thickening,
"ho tried not to think of It. "I love my
!ovo with a B," she said flippantly, "fce
-crjsa he is brave, and I hate my
ilia w!th a C, because he is a Coward
a Coward!"
ITi3 arms relaxed suddenly. "Ah,
lear don't!" te cried. "Is that all? Is
th-t t'-e reason?"
"All?" she echoed. "Isn't it enough?"
"No," he said bitterly; "I'm a cad.
but not as bad as all that. Are you
blind? Ton't you know what was the
matter with him?"
"He was afraid," she whispered. "?.Iy
husband, afraid!"
Neither of them noticed that in front
of the blazing stage the fireproof cur
tain had suddenly finished its arrested
descent, and that n somi-lull ensued.
"Yes"' lie cried' with a revulsion of
loyalty to his friend, "afraid of losin?

to his father and mother? Didn't you
even wonder what he meant by "Not

She shook her head. "Wives know so

wan smile.
"They were burnt to death, when he

3 She covered her face with her hands,
"Oa!" she "murmured. I didn t know.
What have I done?"
"lie told me once," he went on, "that
it had left him with the feeling that
fire would never touch him, but that
to think of unyone he cared for being
in' a lire maae him — well, what you
saw."
They wore silent for an instant.
"Hullo!" he said suddenly, "they;ve
got the curtain down."
The two stood Up. Firemen and po
liccnon were everywhere.
"Ko dancer! No danger!"
The vords passed from mouth to
mouth, and though they were not strict
ly true, the effect of the lowered cur
tain was magical. The crowd was pre
ccptibly thinner, noticeably calmer, but
round each exit ware gruesome proofs
of the violence of the panic.
"Elizabeth!"
They looked at each ether. "It's
John," she said faintly.
"Yes," he said, and his smile was
bitter, "It's John. Good-bye. Forget
it all, Elizabeth. Do you know" he
looked at his watch "It's all hap
pened In less than ten minutes?" ,
"Really?" she said. "It can't be pos
slble."' But her eyc3 wera searching
for her husband.
The Other Man noticed It "Eliza
beth!" he said, half shamefacedly.
"Yes," she answered, her eyes search
Ing the crowd.
"You are going to make up to him
somehow for- — for saying that to
him?" '■-.-'
Her eyes softened and she held out
her hand. "That was nice of you," she
said gently. "Yes, I am going to make
up to him. I pray God, he will nevei
know what t thought."
"Elizabeth!" He had found her at
last. The Other Man slipped away.
"I've found a way," he exclaimed
breathlessly. "Come along."
"Oh," she cried, "you've hurt your
hand; it's bleeding."
He held out the other to her. "No
no: it's nothing. I had rather a bother
with the doors and windows. That's
why I've been so long."
She followed him silently.
When they were In their carriage ard
on their way home tnere was an awk
ward silence. Elizabeth had Just
f.nished bandaging his hand with the
aid of both their handkerchiefs.
"Dear," he said at last, "would you
mind telling me why you you asked
me to go away?"
She looked at him a reproachful
pout. "Must you inquire into all your
wife's weaknesses?" she asked
"I only wondered — '■ "
' "Of course," she interrupted, "I knew
you would, and I meant to tell you.
But you'll despise me. You've got a
very unheroic wife, John; "When I
asked you to go I was she went on
steadily "I was nearly dead with
fright, and I couldn't bear to have you
to see It; so I said the first thing I
thought of to get rid of you while I
got over it; What did I say? 1
didn't know what I was saying, John.
But 1 did get over it."
His face cleared and he bent and
Ms«ed her. His voice was very tender.
"Elizabeth, my wife " he said. "Do
you know" he laughed light-heart
edly "I've been worrying like every
thing about it I fancied you thought
T was in a funk about myself. I—lI — I
thought you meant that."
She stared at him, then burst out
laughing hysterically and threw her
arms round his neck. "Oh, you dear,
darling old stupid!" she cried.
"Don't you know yet that women
never mean what they seem to mean?"
He made a mock gesture of despair.
"So now that you seem to mean you
are well, rather fond of me, Eliza
beth, what do you really mean?"
She smiled up at him swiftly. "That
I consider you just perfect," she whis
pered.
Upstairs In their own room, vhen
he had gone down to give some orders
to the servants, Elizabeth wandered to
the window. Her eyes were troubled.
Suddenly she knelt down and buried
her face in her hands. "Gcd grant,"
she supplicated, "that he will never
know 1 do love him. I have al
ways loved him but that I should
have thought him afraid!" Sketch.
FEAT OF AMATEUR ROBBER.
Met With Entire Success In Separa
ting Man From k.is Watch.
If a man who was robbed of a gold
watch in Chicago, under peculiar con
ditions which he will recognize from
the recital of the adventure by the rob
ber, will communicate with Hobart J.
Allen, of Irving Park, Chicago, he can
have back his timepiece, along with a
profuse apology.
Mr. Alien recently bought a revolver
to pro^ct himself from hold-up men
who lia^e fleeced several victims in a
long subway under the Northwestern
Railway tracks. He was kept at his
business until quite late one night re
ccntiy, and starting home he put his
pistol in his pocket with a feeling of
much satisfaction.
The approach to the subway was
dimly lighted by a single lamp. He
plunged into the cavern and walked
throush. A figure dimmed the exit
and as the two men met, the roar of
passing trains startled them, and they
trcshed each other in passing. A mo
ment later Allen felt for hi 3 watch
It was not in his pocket. F3 ran back
U-rourh the subway and overtook the
other man just a s he was emerging.
"Hand over that watch or I'll blow
your head <fl'." h3 s^o-ted. The man
leaped over a Etono at'.'tzrient and ran.
Allen followed and cornered him a
gainst a wall.
"I'll pive yon another chr.n-o," he
said, leveling his nvlver. The man.
apparently too frightened to speak,
gave him the watch.
Allen went home and told his wife
of hi*; adventure.
"Why, your watch is in there on the
dresser; you didn't take it with you."
she exclaimed. Now Allen is looking
for the man he held up.

THE WOMAN IN BRONZE
Striking Figure of a Woman Who
Died or a Broken Heart.
A story of unrequited love is mutely
told in cold bronze and marble la one
of the cemeteries in the city of Wash
ington, D. C.
The story runs that a beautiful
young woman, daughter of rich par
ents, fell in love with a poor and
struggling artist. The attraction was
mutual, but . her family aspired to a
wealthy alliance. Finally, filial duty
won the day and the girl was led to
the altar by a rich suitor. They lived
together for some time, and the bril
liancy of the match was the tali of
ST. CAUDENS" REALIZATION. ,
Washington society. The w.pman'3
love, however, still went out to the
poor artl3t and her husband, who.had
been informed of the peculiar state of
affairs, could do nothing to win his
wife's affection. All the gifts that
money could buy were showered upon
her, but to no purpose.
- To his horror, one day rcvernl
months after thsir marriage l»e foun 1
uja wife lying dead in a room in their
house, the poor g'rl having died of a
broken heart. Although : deeply iit
tnched to his wife, he was struck with
admiration by her devotion to his -rival,
nnd when she was buried in the family
lot in Itock Creek Cemctcvy, he com
missioned St. Gaudens, the scupltor, to
make a bronze statue of heroic ' size,
depicting her as she was found, dead
and covered with her bathrobe.
The figure of the woman Is seated,
with the bathrobe drawn about her,
and the work is one of great strength.
The bronze is surrounded by marble
beautifully carved. In front of it is a
long marble seat, where one may ad
mire the work of art. No name marl:s
the spot, but at each corner of the lot
is a small marble block, about six
inches square, with the letter "A"
carved in the top. The entire lot is
surrounded by a dense growth of pine
trees, so that one not familiar with the
spot looks in vain for the figure.
Character of England's King.
The character of Kin? E-iwaH.
while Prince of Wales, appears to
have been greatly misuudorstoo...
Many scandals were laid at bis door;
many Journalists and prominent writ
ers found themselves unable to resist
temptation of making bim the theme
of extravagant stories without foun
dation, or at best based only upon
hearsay evidence.
While making no pretence to be
ing a saint, his morals were neither
better nor worse than the majority of
his countrymen and It was precisely
that fact that endeared him to them.
The preat influence that no other
Prince possessed, and which Tvas. pos
sessed by him In a superlative degree,
was very largely due to his remarka
ble tact.
Thanks mor3 to him than to any
other, Irani (Ir;nkin£r, e» -0u3a19, coarse
ond profane language went out of
fashion. He would tolerate in the
houses of respectable people no men
and women who had forfeit-d their
right to remain within . their pale,
aud no woman of questionable ante
cedents could with his sanction con
sort with ladies or with innocent
pirls. Few people had any Idea how
well read he was. It was generally
rppcrted that his reaCins: was very
limited, and yet the reverse wa3 true.
No new book of importance, whether
in German, English or French, nppear
ed that failed to receive his altenticn,
and many surh were read and d:s
cufr-sed at Marlborough House before
their review appeared in print. Not
a few of the French authora were ac
customed to send him their first
copies.
His faults, never grave or serious,
simply served to bring out in croat-r
prominence the many attractive
points of his character, and since his
accession to the throne even those
faults have grown less and his vir
tues and ability become brighter and
greater.
From a Diplomat's Diary.
Home froct the Phlliplaes.
■I've been thinking, ?nco our boy returned
to us one morning,
And In si>iio of nil our doubts and tears
be stood before our view,
what was written by a friend of his, so
cheerily and brjehtly,
to ever trouble trouble till trouble
troubles you."
The lad returned In safety, spite of chills
and spite of fever,
Spite of all the many dangers of t "*nd
and of the Rpa,
Spite of anything we dreaded, SDlte of
faith evinced by neither;
Hereafter let no trouble trouble you nor
trouble me ;
For when the skies are darkest and a
threatened storm surrounds us.
Shutting out the Rlorlous sunlight from
our nearer sighted view.
Then appears the "silver lining" that on
every cloud Is shining:
So never trouble trouble till trouble
troubles you.
That every back Is fitted for the burden
that is (rtvcn /
Is a saying trite, If ancient, while It's
always proven true,
And If the burden's grievous, the good
I.orrt will amngp It
That the trouble will be gone before the
trouble troubles you.
"Tis shown that both onr hopes and fears
are* tn'f anticipation.
For midnight terrors vanish with the
ear!v rno-nlng dew.
And when tint nleht Is darkest the dawn
Is Jnn n-breaklng:
Then don't e-rer trouble trouble till tron.
ble troubles you.

OUPeQ State kind and quantity of drug used.
Or. Waterman, Suite B. 14 Lexington, Av.,N.YWe all know that there is big money
in poultry. How much there is In it for
ns, depends entirely upon Ourselves uuj
whether or not we are keeping up with
the procession in raising tlie kind of
chickens . which bring the most cash
and in getting them into the market at
a time when the demand is greatest.
The value of poultry productiou for the
United States this season was but a
shade nnder that of -wheat or cotton,
amounting to over half a billion dol
lars. Since the perfection of the in
cubator, the importance of the.indus
try has been greatly augmented. By
the use of this splendid device it is now
comparatively c sy to bring in large
quantities , of chickens for v the winter
and early spring market when peesp 'ces

necessary is a proper regard to the ter- ]
perature, and to the brooding of the I
young chicks during the tender period
■ of their existence. The incubator has
' interested thousands of women and
children In the work of chicken raising,
and It Is not to be said that the returns
are less profitable than plowing or
other heavy manual labor.
Cheap Nachir.cs the Nost Expensive.
There are many excellent incubators
upon the market, but there are also
, many cheap, imperfect machines, the
purchasers of which, failing to secure
good results, become disgusted and In
form their "neighbors that artificial in
cubation is a failure and a fake. On
the other hand, the purchaser of a good

Others, in the neighborhood quickly fol

Is no danger of the poultry business
being overdone. It is one of the most
Btaple and profitable lines of business
in the world to-day, for its produces
are always in increasing demand i:>
every town and city in the world, ana
throughout the entir- year.
But before going into the incubator
business it is necessary to have some
good egg producing machinery, that is,
good, laying hens and comfortable and
. cheerful quarters, along with a go 1
system of feeding, .to induce them to
lay. The fertility of eggs Is also af
fected by the conditions of the hens.

overcome, and there win be little
trouble in teaching the uses and man
agement of the ordinary hatching ma
chine.
Not Difficult to Manage.
While there is nothing complex or
difficult about the successful operation
of an incubator, close attention and ex
actness are necessary; yet the results
are more than worth the effort The
woman who fills her lamps regularly
every morning, and the ' man who
winds his . watch or . clock at the
same hour every evening, need not
fear the task of running an incubator;
but unless one is willing to attend to
the few wants of his machine at the
right time, it will be unreasonable to
look for a good hatching of chickens
from the best ■- incubator upon the
market . ;'• . .&V . ' ■ ■'.'
The writer has used Incubators and
has found great delight in hatching
(large flocks of fine chickens from
'them, but it was necessary to do a
little experimenting first to get the ma
chine in good working order, to keep
j Uie lamp trimmed so that it burned a
1 clear, white flame and to do a dozen
i other little things, which in a very
short time made the owner as familiar
with the incubator as with any other
simple piece of farm machinery.
The period of incubation is always
one of expectancy and when the chicks
lio^iu to come forth from the shell
there is either keen joy or a decided
dampening of ardor, according as to
the results of the hatch. But don't be
come discouraged if the first hatch
brings you only 50 per cent, of chick
ens. Go right ahead, determined to
omit the mistakes of the first trial and
aim for 83 or 90 per cent of the next
hatching, which you should get if you
Lave a good incubator and handle it
properly. After a little practice you
come to know your machine, how it is
acting and what it will do, as well as
you know your driving horse, hi fact
you can gaujre it even more closely,
for it is a machine and you can control
it to a nicety.
There are hot air machines and hot
water machines, thero are small
machines and big machines — machines
to meet every need and requirement;
the only thing is to get a good machine.
An Attractive Side Lir.e.
The poultry business on the farm has
always been considered largely within
u-e province of the women folks, and
the enlargement of the industry by
utilizing incubators has not changed
the situation, except that many others
than farmers' wives are now raising
chickens from incubators.
"Modern chicken raising, as it has
been adopted by thousands of people
owning small rural homes," said an
incubator agent to me recently, "ac
counts for the sale of an enormous
number of our incubators and brooders.
In fact, it is among this class largely
! that we do business, and they are
making the money out of it A vast
field is still open among the more con
serva^ve residents of the interior farm
sections, who still stick to old methods,
J.naware of the comparative simplicity
of a good incubator and of the great
profit possible through its use."
Breeding Up the Flock.
Even through the metliam of the
barnyard flock, regarded by • -ny
farmers as a very insignificant part fit
♦hpt>\ Hrpptock. ft very prpflt nddlfon
to the ypnrlv Income Is realized. The
flork snnnlip<» p"? 1 ? and mpat for tho
home throughout the ypar. nnd even If
no additional incomp results, the bnrn
yard flock has served a great pnrpose.
Howeypr, It Is snch nn ensy matter to
breed up a nondescript lot of chickens
into a big laying, heavy weighted and
highly profitable flock, that it seems
strange that there should be a single
flock of dung-hills throughout the conn*
try. It costs no more to feed and care
. for a broad breasted Plymouth Rock,
or a Wyaridotte, or a huge Kght Brah
' ma, or any- of a dozen other splendid
, standard varieties than it does for the
, common scrub, and with the low price
. at which good' eggs, or practically pure
bred cockerels can be had, it is the
easiest thing imaginable to have, after
two or three years of systematic breed
ing, a flock of chickens producing
three times the profit of the original
flock. -";; :■
Standard Kinds of Chickens.
A fascinating little bulletin has been
issued by the Department of Agricul
ture (farmers' bulletin No.' 51) which
is replete with illustrations of the prin
cipal standard ' varieties . of chickens,
the 'reading of which by any chicken
grower, however small, should certain
ly stimulate a New Year resolution to»
make the flock a real money earner.
TMs bulletin, while it will prove, prob
ably, a„» mere i stimulant for mo c
extensive literature on the subject, can
be obtained without cost' from Sena
tors and Members of Congress, or the
Secretary of Agriculture, and the proof
of its popularity is apparent In the
seven or eight editions which it has
been neessary to publish to supply the
demand' throughout the country.
Cap?nizing Fowls.
One of the most attractive features
of poultry raising is the production of
capons.- This is a story all by itself.
It is an experiment which one can en
ter Into and with a very slight expend
iture yt or a set of instruments, can fol
low it to any degree desired. It re
quires some judgment and a little at
tention, but caponizing is not difficult;
it is one of those things. which, while
it looks, in the beginning, to be a hard
proposition, gradually comes to you all
of itself, so that 'the first thing you
know you become • almost an expert,
and the reward is very considerable.
Capons always sell readily and at -a
good advance In price. The birds be
come very docile and easily handled
and are always money makers. . The
readiness wit- which the new capon
recovers from the wound is a revela-

tion as to the splendid physical make
up of a chicken. Any boy or girl, who
has ever succeeded in skinning and
stuffing a bird will take hold of the
caponizing idea with avidity; in fact
caponizing is by far the "easier job; it
is as easy as the skinnng operation, for
in bird mounting the stuffing is the
really difficult part
ORIENTAL INCUBATORS.
Peculiar Facility of Chinese for Arti
ficial .latching.
If we are to look * the beginning
of any particular Industry, we are
usually told that we might find that
this particular work was first carried
on in China. This applies as well to
the artificial hatching of eggs.
Throughout China the hatching of eggs
by heat is a very large and important
industry and has been practiced since
very ancient times. The Oriental who
desires to hatch eggs by artificial heat
first constructs a building of sun
dried brick, plastered on the outside
With mud. Completely fill x one
side and the other also, except for
door space and sufficient room for a
Snan to test the eggs, are round, bar

jars set into them. This j-.r Is \ n rz

Inches of the ground. The conical bot

of eight or nine inches, to keep the

After being tested they are. kept in

are taken in a bamboo basket • and
rolled out on a . mat on the

they remain until hatched. The

are covered with a heavy quilt After
they are hatched the chicks are put

gain strength and then they are ready

THE AMERICAN INCUBATOR IN TURKEY.
After testing, it is stated that 90 per
cent, of those remaining ", will hatch.
This style of incubator.- probably
would not suit American requirements,
>ut the idea of utilizing the heat of the
foom during the later stages of incuba
tion is very valuable, as it economizes
both heat and space.
POULTRY FEEDING.
An Important Phase of the Chicken
Crowing Industry.
Poultry feeding is sometimes a most
serious problem to those who desire to
make this line a specialty. ■ Experi
ence has shown that there are certain
special lines of agricultural operations
with which poultry raising may ad
vantageously be connected. dairy
ing there is usually a large' quantity
of skim milk' or butter-milk which
may be utilized to furnish a consider
able part of the poultry ration. Upon
the fruit farm fowls are also of ad
vantage. They keep down insect pests
and they. may have a free range a
greater part of the season without the
possibility of doing any damage. Plum
growers have found poultry especially
useful in obliterating the curculio, and
•even the apple crop has been consid
erably benefited. If it is found that
,t! <? fowls injure small fruits it is best
that they be confined during the lira
'ited season when the fruit is ripen
ing. Waste fruits, either in winter
or summer, are a wo'"ome and valua
ble addition to the poultry ration.
The market gardtin also furnishes a
large amount of waste products which
may be utilized for poultry feed.
There is the waste lettuce, the small
heads of cabbase. the unsold beets,
carrots and potatoes, the green corn
which cannot be marketed 'or any

purpose, the waste of the tmall fruits,
etc. If properly cared for the hens
will bring a stc. Ly and reliable In
come during the winter months.
Dried clover, roots, tu'>ers, etc., should
be save*! for them during the winter.
These sncMiM be steamed and fed with
the mash or cabbac-*s, and beets may
be fed raw. A <?atch crop of buckwheat
or oafs and peas will furnish much
food'at little expense, xsran. meat,
meal, svheat screenings and oats pur
chased for poultry will bring good re
-|turns in eggs and will also . dd ma
terially to the fertilizer supply.
