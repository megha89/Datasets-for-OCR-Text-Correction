THE BIRTH OF THE MOON.
When -the -Earth Wai a Sphere of
Lava, Molten and Flattened.
The earth revolves on its axis ouce
Ir. 24 hours. Millions of years ago the
dcy was 22 hours; millions of years be
fore It was 21 hours. As we look back
ward into time we find the earth re
volving faster and. faster. Thoiv was
a time, ages ago, long before geology
begins/when the earth was rotating in
a day of five or six hours In length. In
the remotest past the earth revolved In
a day of about five hours. It could re
volve no faster than this and remain a
single unbroken mass.
It was at this time that the moon
was born— separated, broken off from
the parent mass of the earth. The
earth was then a molten, flattened
sphere of lava. Its whole body was
fluid. The tides, which now are small,
superficial _ and, so to say, locals were
then universal and immense. "" They oc
curred at short Intervals. Tbe whole
surface " of our globe"" was affected.
And the corresponding lunar tides In
the fluid, molten moon were Indefinite
ly greater still.
Our day Is now 24 hours; the distance
of the moon Is now 240,000 miles.
When our day was about five hours
long, the moon was In contact with the
earth's surface.; It had just broken
away from Its parent mass. As the
length of the terrestrial day Increased,
so did the distance of the moon. The
two quantities are connected by In
exorable equations. If one varies, so
must the other. Whenever the rotation
time of a planet Is shorter than the
period of revolution of Its satellite, the
effect of their mutual action Is to ac
celerate the motion of the satellite and
to force It to move In a larger orbit
to Increase its distance, therefore.
The day of the earth Is now shorter
than the month— the period of revolu
tion—of the moon. The moon Is there
fore slowly receding from us, and It has
been receding for thousands of cen
turies. But the day of the earth Is, as
we have seen, slowly growing longer.
The finger of the tides Is always press
ing upon' the rim of our huge* flywheel
and slowly but surely lessening tbe
speed of its rotation. So long as the
terrestrial day Is shorter than the
lunar month, the moon will continue to
recede from us.— Professor B. S. Hol
den In Harper's Magazine.
A. Curious Barometer.
A. curious barometer Is said to-be
used by the remnant of the Arancanlan
race which inhabits the southernmost
province of Chile. It consists of the
castoff shell of a crab. The dead shell
Is. white In fair, dry weather, but the
approach of a moist atmosphere Is indi
cated by the appearance of small red
spots. As the moisture in - tbe air In
creases the shell becomes entirely red
and remains so throughout the rainy
season. ■ . ■. .
A Wise Prophet.
"On the whole," said the aged weath

"Why?" asked the neophyte.
"Because people are much more ready
to forgive you if the prediction does
not come true." •

JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY. CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. DECEMBER 20. 1901.
The Ut» of a Coal Miner.
■ First the boy of eight or tenls sent
to the breaker to pick tbe slate and oth
er Impurities from the coal which has
been brought up from the mine. From
there he , Is - promoted and . becomes a
door boy, working, ln the mine. As he
grows older and stronger he Is ad
vanced to the position and given the
pay of a laborer. There he gams , the
experience .which secures him a place
as a miner's helper, and as he acquires
skill and strength he becomes, when ln
the height of his manhood and vigor, a
full fledged miner.
If he is fortunate enough to escape
the falls of rock and coal, he may re
tain this position as a miner for a num
ber of years. But as age creeps on and
he Is . attacked by some of the many
diseases incident to work ln the mines
he makes way for those younger and
more vigorous following i him up the
ladder whose summit he has reached.
He then starts on the descent going
back to become a miner's helper, then
a mine - laborer, now a door.' boy, and
when old and decrepit he finally re
turns to the breaker where he started
as a child, earning the same wages as
are received by the little urchins who
work at his side. There Is no incen
tive for ambition ln the average min
er's life. He cannot rise to places of
eminence : and wealth. > Only 1 In 500
can even be given place as a foreman
or superintendent and these are posi
tions which few miners care to hold. —
John Mitchell ln Cosmopolitan.
For His Reputation, $500.
The proprietor of a large dry goods
store had decided to tear down the old
building and erect a new one in Its
stead. In furtherance of this plan he
was removing his goods to temporary
quarters in another building.
The goods were nearly all out of the
old structure when from some un
known cause It caught fire. . The de
partment was promptly on hand and
soon had a stream playing on the
flames, but the merchant was wild
with excitement ■ Running up to the
chief, he urged him to greater baste.
"Never mind the goodsf he shouted.
"Save the sliding! I'll give tbe boys
a check for $500 for their pension fund
If they don't let the fire spread beyond
that floor!"
"Why, you're going to tear the old
building down anyway, aren't yon?",
asked the chief. ~.i--
"Yes," he said, "but do you suppose
I want the Insurance companies or any
body on earth to think that's the rea
son why It caught fire?"
By great exertion the fire was ex
tinguished with little loss so far as the
building. was concerned, and the mer
chant was as good as bis word. —

Queer Creatures.
| There are microscopic creatures
which live in roof gutters and on the
bark of trees and are known as water
bears and wheel animalculse. If allow
ed to dry up under the microscope, they
can.be seen to shrivel into shapeless
masses, which may be kept for years
uninjured in the dried state.
On being placed after this long Inter
val In water they gradually plump up,
resume their proper shape and move
about In search of food Just as If noth
ing bad happened. Much the same is
true for the minute worms which from
tbe substances In which they live are
known as paste and vinegar eels. Well
known Is the famous case of the desert
scail, which, retracted Into its shell,
was fastened to a tablet in the British
museum and showed no sign of life for
seven years, when one morning it was
found crawling hungrily about tbe
glass case that formed its prison.
Dp His Sleeve.
At the battle of Omdurman a soldier
belonging to a Scotch regiment - was
nearly killed by a bullet which struck
the ground Just hi front of him while
he was firing ln a reclining position.
On rising to move a few feet forward,
something came down his sleeve. It
was the bullet How It got up bis
sleeve wltbont Inflicting damage can
only be accounted for by the fact that
It must have been spent by the time It
struck the ground In front of him and
the course of Its flight up his sleeve
was Its last billet
The Color of Wood.
I A simple way to restore color to wood
is to mix the color with oil and turpen
tine, applying with a soft cloth and
rubbing hi well. Either the powdered
pigment or colors ground ln oil may
be used. For light oak nse raw um
ber, for dark oak burnt umber. If It
Is very dark, add a mere shade of lamp
black. For mahogany nse burnt sien
na, chrome yellow and blsmarck brown,
and for cherry use burnt sienna.

Change to Change a Quarter.
"How much docs it take to change a
quarter?" asked the bartender. "Twen
ty-five cents, eh? Not on your life. It
takes seventy cents to do the trick.
How many ways do you suppose a
quarter dollar can be changed? Just
exactly eleven. A. fellow of limited
means may like the jingle of coin In
his clothes. In that event you can give
him twenty-five pennies or twenty pen
nies and one nickel. He may like to
have a little sprinkling of sliver ln his
clothes, and you can accommodate him
with fifteen pennies and a dime or ten
pennies, a dime and a nickel.
"If he prefers to have change handy
for a beer and a car fare, why, fifteen
pennies and two nickels will fix him
up, and If he wants a cigar In addition,
besides having a little stock of cash
In his jeans, give him ten pennies and
three nickels. That makes six ways.
Now, then, a fellow with a quarter can
trade It off for five pennies and two
dimes, five pennies anfl four nickels,
two dimes and one nickel, one dime
and three nickels or five nickels, just
as he prefers. And to accommodate
htm ln any way that he might select
you have to possess twenty-five pen
nies, two dimes and five nickels—sev
enty cents In all."— Philadelphia Rec

Pound Foolishness.
One of the commonest forms of pound
foolishness is countenanced by many
high authorities. This is the purchase
of certain household provisions In large
quantities. Few writers on domestic
topics fall to lay stress upon the econ
omy of buying groceries in bulk. That
sugar, and flour," potatoes and apples
should be bought by the half or whole
barrel, cereals by the case, butter by
the tub and other things ln like propor
tion Is one of the early precepts In the
"Young Housekeeper's Complete Guide
to Domestic Economy."
Tbe ignorant ■ young things buy tbe
provisions first and the experience aft
erward, jj The flour grows ■ musty, the
cereals develop weevils, the potatoes
and apples rot long before they can be
eaten, and the cook exercises a lavish
ness ln the nse of the butter and sugar
she would never show were they bought
In such limited amounts that the house
keeper could hold close watch over
them. Even after these events the
young mistress feels as If she were ab
solutely reckless and no manager at all
when she so far departs from house
hold law as to buy food In small quan
tities.—lndependent
Loneliitess and Health.
A medical journal has of late been
discoursing on the Indigestion of-lone
llness. ; By this title Is meant to be In-,
dicated the disorders of digestion which
are believed to follow the practice i of
taking one's meals In solitary, stnte.
.The topic Is by no means an (uninter
esting one. Thousands of men and wo
men living alone are compelled to take
their meals for the most part without
company. Week In and week out they
feed themselves without a soill to talk
to, and the medical journal devotes Its
energies to showing that the practice
Is not one that Is likely to be conducive
to digestion, to proper bodily nourish
ment or to health. The solitary man
soon tires of-merely eating, and, If he is
not of a literary turn of mind, his tend
ency Is to hurry through his meals to
escape from his loneliness into tbe so
ciety of his fellow men. Herein, It is
held, lies a danger to health.
Discovery of Coal In \Vnlt-n.
During the reign of Henry VIII.
many attempts were made to discover
coal In north Wales, and a Shrewsbury
man, named Richard Gardner, was the
only person who succeeded. The old
records read: "He attemptyd and put
Into proofe to fynde out coles about the
town (Shrewsbury) ln soondry placys,
and In -one place especlall callyd Ema
tlne Haye, hard by the sayd towno. he
found by his great dyllgence and trobnll

only worthy of commendacon and

A Cartons Eating; Custom.
The Dyaks divide ln pairs when the
hour arrives for taking food, the father
and mother at one platter, two sisters
at one and still two brothers at anoth

divided as to sex, a brother and sister
may. eat together, but this must al
ways be the youngest and oldest of the

"What curious mistakes men make

Instance, that Columbus Imagined that
he had discovered the Indies."

Health and Beauty.
A poor complexion is usually the re
sult of a torpid liver or irregular action
of the bowels. Unless nature's refuse
is carried off it will surely cause impure
blood. Pimples, boils and other erup
tions follow. This is nature's method
of throwing off the poisons which the
bowels failed to • remove. De Witt's
Little Early Risers are ■world famous
for remedying this condition. They
stimulate the liver and promote regular
and healthy action of the bowels but
never cause griping, cramps or dis

Ideas of Neirs.
Justice John M. Harlan of the United
State supreme court, when a practic
ing lawyer ln Louisville, once tried his
band at newspaper work, taking the
place of a personal friend, then editor
of the Louisville Commercial. The Jus
tice got along all right writing editori
als, but had ideas as to news that were
at variance with those of the city edi
tor.
One of the reporters had written a
clever account of a man who had fallen
from the fourth story of a building and
escaped without serious injury. It
made a story of about a column ln
length. With a proof of the article in
his hand the temporary editor came to
the city editor and said:
I "Mr. Smith, please have this story
cut down. I can't see anything in It
that makes it worth that space."
I "But it's the 'star* story of the day,
Mr. Harlan," gasped the astonished
news man. "I think It's a remarkable
story and well worth all the space giv
en to It"
, "I don't," said Justice Harlan. "If a
man had jumped np four stories, It
would certainly have been remarkable,
but even. a fool could fall down four
stories, or half a dozen, for that mat
ter."—New York Times.
Tbe Driver* Point of Vlevr.
The hotel coach was filled with a
crowd of happy. Jubilant visitors, and
the horses toiled splendidly up tbe
hills. As each eminence was reached
and at every turn ln the road the crowd
would burst forth Into cries of wonder
and delight at the magnificent scenes
which burst upon their view. The
mountain Jehu alone preserved a dig
nity and silence which rather awed the
others. At length, after a particularly
lovely view had been passed, one of the
guests at the driver's left hand re
marked:
"You don't seem to take much inter
est ln the scenery. No doubt it's an old
story to you."
The driver shook his bead. **No,
that's not It," he answered. "1 Just
don't care." Then he leaned a little
closer and whispered: "But I knows
Just how you folks must feel. You all
come from a long distance Just to see
things, and you're bound to enjoy it
anyhow so as to get your moneys
worth and not feel as though you was

Held by Etlanette.
When Dom Pedro, then emperor of
Brazil, was entertained at the White
House, be had been told by a confused
senator that It would be expected that
he, the emperor, should be the last of
the guests to depart.
The president's wife, however, inforib
ed her other guests that they would be
expected to follow, not precede, the
royal party ln leaving the house.
The result was that no one dared to
go for fear of a breach of etiquette.
But at 3 o'clock ln the morning a tired
woman pretended Illness, and the dead
lock was broken.

The Tngboat Captain.

Coloring of Flower*.
A florist says that tbe law governing
the coloring of flowers makes a blue
rose impossible. According to this law
tbe three colors red, blue and yellow
never all appear In the same species
of flowera. Any two may exist, but
never the third. . Thus we have the red
and yellow roses, but no blue; red and
blue -verbenas, but no yellow; yellow
and blue in tbe various members of
the viola family (as pansies, for In
stance), but no red; red and yellow
gladioli, but no blue, and so on.
Robber Plants.
Many plant growers become annoyed
because the older leaves at tbe base of
their rubber plants turn yellow and
fall off. This is a natural process. It
does not indicate any defect in tbe
plant It is simply the ripen ing of the
old foliage, which cannot be retained
indefinitely. Sometimes, however, the
loss of foliage results from the want of
root room, but hi such cases tbe plants
refuse to grow.

The Mistake of the Polar Bear.
Nordenskjold fonnd that the white
beans generally went through a long
performance of stalking his sailors,
clearly on the mistaken conclusion that
they were seals. As the men were
clothed partly in sealskin, it was a very
natural mistake. But the Interest of
the story lies In the generalization
made by the bear. The bear said:
J "There are two or three seals, one
standing up on its flippers in a very
unusual way. I will therefore stalk
them unseen as long as I can and
when they see me pretend to be doing
something else."
So the men, with their guns and
lances, who wanted to shoot the bear
had the pleasure of seeing him careful
ly crawling behind rocks and. Ice hum
mocks, making long detours thla.way
and that and every now and ■ then
clambering up a rock and peeping cau
tiously over to see if the seals had
gone. On the open snow the bear
would saunter off hi another direction
and then, falling . flat . push himself
along on his belly, with his great front
paws covering his black muzzle, the
only thing not matching the snow
about him. Just as the bear thought
he had got his "seal" the latter fired
and shot him, a victim of false analogy.

NorwcKlan Hotel Fire Escapes.
Nor do Norwegian hotels themselves
console you. Built of wood, their chief
merit lies In the fire escape, which is to
be found in the chief room upon every
landing. At Visnes I spent a happy
night answering the questions of nerv
ous travelers who came from hour to
hour to see If the fire, escape In my
room was working properly. Angry
assurances were powerless to convince
timid If ancient ladles. Did I really
think the rope would work? Was there
any danger? Had I tried the contriv
ance myself? Excellent souls! As If
the printed notice were not enough!
Ah, that printed notice! I have a
copy of It by me as I write. It is the
complete instruction In English to the
traveler threatened by fire In a wooden
hotel In Norway. Let me give It you as
I found It:
"Fire escape to throw out the win

Florists' Lives. Are Short.
"It Is commonly supposed that the
men who work in the mines or tbos'e
whose occupations necessitate the
breathing of poisonous fumes and gases
are the shortest lived," said a promi

and It will surprise many, to learn that
the highest death rare Is found among
a class who breathe in the sweetest
odors— florists.
"The reason is a simple one. The flor
ist lives at once In the torrid and the
frigid zone. From a greenhouse atmos
phere of nearly 100 degrees In the win
ter months be must step out into one
that Is nearly always below freezing
point and often below zero. In sum
mer he has change to encounter, too, as
hi the spring and fall. By force of hab
it he grows careless and often works
without his coat In the hot, artificial at
mosphere, and this Increases the dan
gers to which he Is exposed. Lungs

well as rheumatism, find In the florist
the least resistance."— Galveston News.

Letter From Skagway.
Skagway, Alaska, Nov. 28. 1901.
Dear Ledger:—
. Thanksgiving day again finds us
in the land of frozen blessedness. Like
England, we are glorying in our
"splendid isolation." No mail from
the south now for six days. The steam
ship Dirigo was due three days ago
with a supply of turkeys, but has not
yet arrived. The Canadian telegraph
line to "Vancouver has been down ■ for
several days; in fact, that has been its
normal condition ever since it was
opened in October, making- our connec
tion with the outside world very spas
modic and uncertain. The cable to
Juneau is a failure thus far, as the jag
ged rocks cut it to pieces faster than It
can be repaired. 1 Between White Horse
and Dawson there is ice enough to keep
steamboats from running, and all traffic
is suspended \ until the ice is thick
enough to travel over, then stages will
leave each end of the route every day.
Trains run regularly between here and
White Horse, but often with less than
half a dozen passengers. Here in Skag
way are about 3000 people, all together
by their lonely selves, yet enjoying life
as well as those nearer civilized centers.
Three daily papers, one weekly, and one
monthly, show that we are not exactly
illiterate, nor altogether saintly. Five
churches are well attended, and the
Salvation Army is much in evidence,
at least once in 24 hours. Two hun
dred and six children keep five teachers
busy in the new $9000 school house.
The police court and jail are not lonely
places by any means, and eleven
lawyers wear good clothes '■ and smoke
two bit cigars. The Light & Power
Co. is putting in a new $40,000 electric
plant, and improvements are being
made in many places. ■ The frequent
blasts heard from the prospect tunnels
on either side of town, tell where the
ledges are being tested,' and if, as many
believe, these mountains are worth
working, Skagway has a great future.
These ledges lie like those of the
Tread well lode, and would require no
hoists or pumps. We have had no
severely cold weather yet,' and very
little snow— a marked contrast to Last
year. The average temperature lately
is 20 degrees above, just keen and brac
ing. . Windows generally have a dainty
tracing of frostwork, under foot the
snow creaks at every step, gloves 'and
mittens are very comfortable, and • un
covered ears soon tingle. From the
mountain side east of town comes a
mighty racket, caused by the wood
that is being constantly sent down the
numerous chutes or slides, from where
it grew, to the level plain on which the
town stands. Some of these chutes are
half a mile long, and a cheap, quick
moans of transportation. .Wood. sells
for $6 and $7 a cord; coal is $13 a ton.
To-day union services are held in the
Baptist church, egg-nog and hot lunch
es in the saloons, and the "A. B. S."
give a "Grand Ball" in their hall to
night. The Arctic Brotherhood is a
society started in Skagway about three
years ago, and now has lodges all over
the northern country. The chief ex
citement lately, is the supposed un
earthing, by the Northwest Mounted
Police, of an organization called the
Order of the Midnight Sun; the object
of which was to overthrow the Canadi
an government, and ask protection ■ of
the United States. Whether this be
lief had any foundation or not, it is
certainly a strange state of affairs,
when Uncle Sam pays so much atten
tion to aliens across the ocean, and al
lows American citizens to be driven
out of American territory, and a region,
rich as that for which England. is
fighting in South Africa, given up
without a protest.
The sun is in sight here now less than
two hours each day, and yet we would
all be happy if the Dirigo had arrived
with those turkeys. An inquiry made
by kind-hearted people regarding .the
destitute in town, resulted In the com
forting assurance that no one was
without means to buy turkey If the
birds could be found. Another in
stance of Turkey's shortcomings.
Yours in disappointment,
C. H. G.
Friday morning — The Dirigo has just
arrived, with three tons of turkeys.
Dealers' are selling them for a bit a
pound. _>•;.■■

FRIDAY DECEMBER 20, 1901
CHRISTMAS.
-
Christmas is the one holiday that
stands out from' all other festive
seasons. It is the festival not of
one nation, but of all Christendom.
It is commemorative of the birth of
the Christian era, by the advent of
the babe of Bethlehem. It is the
only birthday that has withstood
the shock of ages, and is in fact
more widely celebrated as the cen
turies roll by. And yet the exact
day and even year of the birth of
Christ is a matter of conjecture.
These points have become dim with
the lapse of ages. It was not until
the fourth century that the 25th of
December was fixed upon by the
ecclesiastical authority as - the date
of his birth. One of the main, argu
ments that-led to this decision was
the meteorological conditions and the
customs of sheepherders in the land
of Palestine. Neither ecclesiastical
nor civil records have been handed
down from cotemporaneous times
affecting this interesting question,
except the four biographical sketch
es known as the gospels, written by
the fishermen of Galilee. Strange
that these unlettered men, who in
picturing a perfect human character
accomplished a task that baffled all
the wisdom of the ancients, should
leave this matter in obscurity.
Christmas was at first observed as
an exclusively sacred festival, and in
its celebration was gradually intro
duced gorgeous display and attract
ive ceremonies. Latterly it has par
taken of a social as well as a re
ligious character, and children es
pecially are accustomed to look for
ward to it as the season of gift and
merry making. It is emphatically
the period of glad tidings today, as
it was to the shepherds of old, and
recognized as such the world over.
How or when the custom originated
of exchanging the familiar compli
ment of this particular season we
know not. Its appropriateness,
however, as expressive of the good
feeling and well wishes of one toward
another is beyond dispute. And in
accordance with this old-time cus
tom the Ledger extends its greeting
to its readers, and sincerely wishes
them a merry Christmas and happy
new year.
THAT CARBONDALE BRIDGE.
From parties living in the vicinity
of the so-called emergency bridge
Dear Carbondale, . we learned that
up to the middle of last week nothing
.had been done toward the construc
tion of the bridge at that point;
so far as material, on the ground
was concerned. It is now two
months since the contract was
awarded without competition, on
the ground that it was a case of
great emergency that would not
permit of delay in calling for bids in
the usual way. We said at the time
" that in all probability the public
would have obtained a bridge quicker
• and cheaper if the supervisors had
proceeded in the ordinary way, and
time has proven the correctness of
that statement. It is -now rumored
that the price, $1200, is far beyond
what the structure would have cost
had competitive bids been called for.
What has caused the delay in the
erection of this bridge we are not
prepared to say. The hollo wness of
the "great emerge ncy" cry has been
demonstrated by the course of events.
We do not doubt the sincerity of
the supervisors on this question.'
They acted as they thought for the
»' best interests of the community,
j although with undue haste! ' Some
body has been deceived. It would
be a salutary lesson if some citizen
would protest the payment of the
bill for this bridge, if it is construct
ed at all under the emergency con
tract.
Rumor is rife in Jackson this week
that another fly has been caught in
a webb. — Dispatch.
Rumors of a definite character
have been in circulation in this burg
for years that divers persons have
been afflicted with rust. The Ledger,
unlike its green-eyed cotemporary,
has never heretofore considered
either the subject or the object of
sufficient importance to its readers
to demand even local, much less
editorial mention.

THE MODOC LYNCHING.
The Modoc county lynchers are now
on trial, and it is dollars to doughnuts
that there will be no conviction. There
is reason for this. The citizens of that
county had been annoyed for the past
few years by haying their stock stolen,
shot and mutilated, and, after having
invoked the aid of the law on several
occasions without securing a conviction,
took the law in their own bands and
did a little wholesale^hanging. Mob
law is to be deprecated on all occasions,
but the fact still remains that when
justice fails to be meted out to the
wropgdoers ; citizens step in and ad
minister it in a crude but sometimes
satisfactory way. — Dispatch. *
A more despicable expression of
sentiment than the above can hard
ly be imagined. In addition to being
in execrable taste, it lacks both con
sistency and courage. Like the
notorious district attorney of Modoc
county, it tries to straddle both
sides of a clean-cut issue. It pro
fesses to condemn mob law, and in
the same breath pats the lynchers
on the back for having performed a
satisfactory job. It conveys the idea
that society in California is only
half organized, and mob lavtf is. a
necessary evil occasionally to keep
the lawless element within bounds.
We emphatically dissent from this
infamous declarat ion. It is a libel
upon the state, and we but voice the
overwhelming sentiment of Amador
county in repudiating such utter
ances. We have heard democratic
encouragement of lawlessness before,
but never such a vile backing of a
villainous crime as this. The Modoc
lynching — inexcusable from every
standpoint — takes preeminent rank
among the exploits of murderous
mobs in this state. If the lynchers
emerge unscathed from the clutches
of the law, as our cotemporary so
flippantly predicts, all we can say
is, it will be a setback to the prog
ress of Modoc county only second to
the lynching itself. While the state
of California and the county of Mo
doc are each pouring out treasure
without stint in a legal struggle to
bring the band of lynchers to justice,
and thereby wipe out as far as pos
sible the blot of their foul deeds,
it is deplorable to find a journal so
forgetful or defiant of its duty of
loyalty to law and order as to co
vertly applaud these miscreants who
judge not by law and try not by
jury, and gleefully anticipate a mis
carriage of justice as administered
by the courts.
OOR cotemporary intimates that
the incorporation issue will be tried
again in Jackson at the general
election next year, and that those in
favor thereof will be overwhelmingly
in the ascendant. "Distance lend
enchantment to his views." He
fails to state on what he bases his
prophetic utterance. What has
brought ' about such a wonderful
change in the voters. Why will it
carry next year, when it failed to
carry this year? And why submit
the issueat ageneral election? What
benefit in the way of economy or
any other respect can result from
such a course? If it were legal, it
certainly is inexpedient, if not im
practicable, and would effect no sav
ing whatever in expense. Further
more, candidates for local offices
would not care to inject that issue
into the local canvass. The demo
cratic sheet is talking wildly. We
believe we will be much safer in
predicting that the incorporation
issue will not be mixed up with the
next general election.

George Fullen and Tom Ryan, both
£ of whom live near MarteU's station, had
- a novel experience in money matters
"recently. Fullen left $100 with Ryan
.. on deposit, which the latter put in his
safe. When it became necessary to
I pay taxes, Fullen drew his money and
came to town on that business. Ar
riving here he got twenty dollars from
a friend, and paid his taxes therewith,
receiving five silver dollars in change,
which were wrapped up by themselves,
and leaving his $100 in gold intact.
On returing he again deposited, as he
. thought, the $100 with Ryan, remark
ing that he had not used any of it.
Without opening it Ryan placed the
package in his safe. ' Some days there
after|Fullen, having use for some money
called upon his banker, and was handed
his package of coin just as it had been
received. On opening it, instead of
five double-eagles, it was found to con
tain five silver dollars. Blank astonish
ment was pictured in the countenance
of each at this startling discovery.
Ryan naturally was roused to action
by the turn of affairs, and set to work
to unravel the mystery. Coming to
. Jackson he found the $100 package was

Gotow, who was convicted of grand
larceny last week, has been bewailing
his lot ever since his conviction. Per
sons passing by the jail have repeatedly
heard him weeping in his cell, and
denouncing Christenson, his companion

There is no question that his distress
is sincere, and not assumed for effect.
On receiving his sentence of seven
years, he broke into a flood of tears
that was affecting to behold, and elicit

ates the impression that he is not of the
hardened criminal class. His sentence
of seven years is thought >by some to
be a little severe when contrasted with
the sentence of two years meted out to
his brother convict for the same crime.
True, the one pleaded guilty and the
other stood trial, but it is a debateable
question whether or not this should
make any difference whatever in the
degree of punishment.

THE AMADOR LEDGER: JACKSON, CAIiIFOKJNTIA, FRIDAY. DECEMBER 20, 1901.
WEDDING NOTES.
- Arthur B. Sanborn, a native son of
Jackson, and who was connected with
the newspaper business in Amador
county for several years, having owned
and edited the Amador Sentinel up to
the period of its demise, has entered
the matrimonial ranks again. The
Chronicle of the 14th makes mention
of the affair in the follow ing item:
. A quiet home wedding took pace
last Wednesday at the residence of
Mr. and Mrs. L. l£lku.«, when their
niece, Miss Blanche L. Huiss, was
married to Arthur B. Sanborn. Judge
Carroll . Cook officiated. The bride
wore a castor-colored gown, combined
with shell pink, and trimmed with
duchess lace.
Baffin gton—Evani.
The most talked of wedding that has
taken place in Jackson for some time,
was solemnized in the parlor of the
National hotel at an early hour Mon
day moriiing,~Tlnd united in the bonds
of wedlock P. C. Buffington, formerly
editor of the Ledger, and Mrs. Mary
Evans, who for many years was
proprietress of the National hotel.
This event has been a prominent topic
of conversation about town for weeks.
The prominence of the contracting
parties, coupled with the fact that
both are past middle age, naturally
imparted interest, to the affair. Mr.
Buffington has been in San Francisco
for some weeks, and was delayed there
beyond his anticipations on account of
his duties as a member of the Press
Committee for the Chinese exclusion
convention. Sunday evening he re
turned to Jackson by the stago, and at
six o'clock the following morning the
ceremony was performed in the hotel
parlor, which had been specially deco
rated for the occasion, by the Rev. Geo.
H. Van Vliet, in the presence of a num
ber of invited guests. Immediately
after the service the pair partook of a
wedding breakfast, with a select com
pany of friends, and immediately after
ward started in a surrey for lone to
take the train for Oakland, their future
home. The scene as they started on
their journey was one to be remember
ed. Amid a shower of rice, and the
greetings of a host of friends gathered
at the hotel to witness their departure,
they bid adiou to their long residence
in Jackson. We are ' informed that a
cosy home had been selected '-in Oak
land, and neatly fitted up for their re
ception. The Ledger acknowledges
the receipt for a compliment of wine
in honor of this occasion, and hopes
the years of matrimonial felicity may
be many.
Tho bride in this case has been a
resident of Jackson since early days.
She is the widow of the late Ellis
Evans, the well known proprietor of
the National hotel, and a sister of C.
M. and James Meek of this town. ' The
groom is well known to the readers of
the Ledger, having weilded the pen as
editor of the Republican, and after
ward of the Ledger, when the two
papers were consolidated about two
years ago, which position he filled with
ability up to the time of the purchase
of the paper by the present editor
about six months ago, ■ - . .-
The Guessing Contest.
We have just received a statemen t
from the Press Publishing Association
of Detroit in relation to the total vote
for governor, cast in the recent elec
tions in Ohio, lowa and Massachusetts.
The figures are not wholly official, and
may be somewhat changed by official
count, but they are near enough for all
practical purposes as far as the contest
concerns the Ledger subscribers who
took part therein. The vote is as fol
lows: V.7"-
Ohio (official) 827566
lowa (unofficial) 390441
Massachusetts (unofficial) 324526
Total 1542533
It will be some time yet before the
successful guessers are known. Our
Amador guessers were all a long way
too high in their estimates. The only
one of the 120 guessers from the Led
ger subscribers who guessed right on
the two first figures was F. M. Frates
of Sutter Creek, whose guess was 1,583,
754. This is 41,221 over the mark, and
hardly likely to come within the win
ning numbers.
School Closing at Franklin.
A very pleasant afternoon was spent
at the Franklin school house last Fri
day, Dec. 13, it being the closing of
school for the winter vacation. After
a short program, remarks were made
by R. O. McKean and S. Lessley,
which were appreciated by those
present. Miss Jennie McKean sang
several solos with guitar accompain
ment. Miss McKean is a cousin of R.
O. McKean, her home being in Santa
Cruz. She is a charming young lady,
and the many friends she made while
here, regret that she must so soon re
turn home. Those present were: Mr.
and Mrs; R. O. McKean, Mr. and Mrs.
S. Lessley, Mrs. W. H. Lessley, Mrs.
Fred Goodman, - Grandma Goodman,
Miss J. McKean, Miss B. McKean, Miss
F. V. Schoonmaker, W. Liddicoat,
and Lizzie Miller.
Leg Broken.
. Constable Scoble of Plymouth,
brought' to the county hospital last
Tuesday, Timothy McCarty, who met
with an accident resulting in a broken
leg. It seems that McCarty, while
under the influence of liquor in Ply
mouth, got into an altercation In the
street and in kicking, drove his right
leg against a post with such violence as
to break the small bone below the
knee, and also dislocate the ankle.
He is about 30 years of age, and has
been employed at the Prloe mine.

NEWS FROM THE MINES
Work Being Done at the
Del Monte.
Outlook Encouraging at the South
Eureka.— Five Stamps Dropping
at the Amador-Phoenix.
Slaughterhouse.— Work on this
quartz mine, near Oleta, has been sus
pended for a while, for what reason we
are unable to say. According to all ac
counts the rock prospected well,"" giv
ing an average assay value of $10 per
ton. The ledge is from" 18 inches to
two feet wide, and the depth attained
is less than 100 feet. Operations will
no doubt be resumed ere long.
South Eureka.— Superintendent
Parks informs us that the outlook for
this mine is more encouraging than at
any time in its history. Assessments
have been discontinued for about a
year, and an indebtedness of $10,000
has been paid off by the net proceeds
of the mine. The mine is opened up
to the depth of 2000 feet, and large ore
bodies exist in all levels. The rock,
however, is mostly low grade — too low
to admit of milling alone. Exploration
has been pushed with a view of discov
ering some ore of higher grade, which,
mixed with the low grade, would leave
a margin of profit. This hope is likely
to be realized, and as soon as the pros
pect justifies, the company will con
sider the question of providing a larger
and up-to-date mill.
Kennedy. — This big property moves
along in its accustomed gait, with the
prospect of at least doubling its milling
capacity next spring. The manage
ment is debating the question whether
to erect a 40 or 60 stamp mill at the
east shaft. It is also contemplated to
put in power drills. The Gwin and
Oneida have found this method of
drilling considerably more economical
than hand labor. With the addition
to the mill the mine will give employ
ment to from 50 to 75 more men at
least.
Amador-Phoenix.— Five stamps of
tho mill were started Monday morning,
running on rock from the dump. The
appearance of the plates, we are told,
indicate a paying value, and fully up
to expectations, considering the mixed
character of the ore that is being
worked.
Peerless.— This mine has been dis
mantled, the machinery taken out of
the shaft, and work abandoned. We
are informed that it is the intention to
prospect the property at another point.
Del Monte.— The monthly report
says that during the month of Novem
ber work was advanced upon the new
crosscut tunnel a distance of 75 feet;
east drift on old tunnel leval advanced
about thirty feet, at which distance
the ledge reappeared upon the face of
the drift, and rapidly widened out to
three feet of ledge matter, including
quartz, filling and gouge, all well min
eralized and showing good values upon
prospecting. Every indication leads
the management to believe that the
ledge is approaching its intersection
with another vein traceable by surface
croppings, which intersection will un
doubtedly develop an excellent body of
good milling ore. The appearance of
the ledge is so gratifying that it has
been decided to prosecute work dili
gently upon the east drift, drive a
raise, and crosscut the foot wall to
prospect the country beyond. The
superintendent reports tho appearance
of the ledge now to bo better than any
thing yet encountered east of the shaft.
It was also decided at the meeting of
the board of directors held Dec. 6, that
negotiations be made for the immedi
ate purchase of a compressor and drills
for the work on the crosscut tunnel;
that a contract be let for cutting 100
cords of wood for milling purposes, and
arrangements made for increasing the
force of men on January Ist. The
secretary, who is still at work in the
east, reports over 5000 shares sold since
Nov. 1, with excellent prospects' of In
creasing this amount by 10,000 before
spring, which will enable the directors
to remove the stock from the market.
Terrible Accident.
A shocking accident happened last
Saturday morning, through the care
less handling of firearms. The victim
is a young man, named ' Frank Molo
vich, an Austrian, 25 years of age. He
was out hunting on the lone road. In
passing through a fence or gate, about
a mile from MarteU's station, in pulling
his gun toward him the weapon was in
some unaccountable manner discharg
ed. . It was loaded with small shot,
and the charge passed through his
right hand. Leaving his gun on the
ground, he made all possible haste to
MarteU's, and sent for Dr. Gall, who
attended to the injured man promptly.
The hand is badly shattered, but the
doctor hopes to be able to save the two
small fingers and the thumb; the other
two fingers have been amputated.
The victim is a member of the Austrian
Benevolent Society, and will be taken
care of by that order.
An Evangelist's Story.
"I suffered for years with a bronchial
or lung trouble and tried various reme
dies but did not obtain permanent re
lief until I commenced using One Min
ute Cough Cure, " writes Rev. James
Kirkman, evangelist of Belle River, 111.
"I have no hesitation in recommending
it to all sufferers fromlmaladies of this
kind." One Minute Cough Cure af
fords immediate relief for coughs, colds
and all kinds of throat and lung trou
bles. For croup it is unequalled.
Absolutely safe. Very pleasant to take,
never fails, and is really a favorite with
the children. They like it. Kerr's
Pharmacy, Jackson.
The suits of F. A. Orr and L. Don
nelly against L. Ferdinando have been
settled by arbitration, Orr being
awarded $125 and Donnelly $200.
On Christmas day first mass will be

the San Francisco Chronicle of Decem
ber 17. The publication is made in
pursuance of the provisions of a state
law, the presumption being that ac
counts left for that length of time with
out any action whatever are without
owners. In this instance, however, we
find that the name of Malcolm Camp
bell _ McKinnon appears on the last
great register of this county, as an
elector of Antelope precinct. He was
therefore re-registered less than two
years ago, and has been a well known
mountaineer of the eastern part of the
county for many years, and is, for all
that we have heard to the contrary, in
bis old stamping grounds yet.
Trusts and combinations do not af
fect Jesse Moore Whiskey. Its fame is
established, its quality is the finest and
it is always the best.

Main Street JACKSON
The Proposed New Boad.
A proposition has been before the
supervisors for several months, on peti
tion of L. P. Haney and others, for a
new county road from a point on
Myers ranch on Stony creek, to con
nect with the Buena. Vista road. In
all, a total of five miles was to be added
to the highways under public control.
Considerable interest was manifest on
both sides of the controversy.. C.\C.
Prouty, a prominent farmer and land
owner of Jackson valley, was active in
urging the creation of tho new { road;
U. F. Elledge, also a largo stock-raiser
of the valley, over whose land the pro
posed new road would pass, was equally
earnest in opposition. At the hearing
of the case, it developed that the road
as surveyed would cross Jackson creek
six times in its five mile run, involving
the maintenance of a double line of
fence at each crossing. The serious
objection was pointed out by super
visor Amick, who said that he could
not in justice to himself and his con
stituents, vote for the measure under
such circumstances. I It was admitted
by those who were earnestly advocat
ing the new road, that this was a seri
ous objection. On this showing the re
port of the viewers, recommending
this line of road, was rejected. There
after upon being questioned by the
supervisors, the petitioners declined to
give a bond in the sum of $2500 to guar
antee the expenses, upon which state
ment the supervisors -by a unanimous
vote threw out the petition.

Arm Broken.
The Examiner of Wednesday contains
the following:
J. F. Parks, superintendent of the
Kennedy mine in Amador county, is
confined to his room in the Palace
suffering from a compound fracture of
one of his arms as a result of a fall near
the corner of Market and Montgomery
streets. This is the third time in as
many successive years that Mr. Parks
has sustained a broken leg or arm.
From messages received by his rela
tives here, it seems that the accident
occurod in the early part of the week.
Mr Parks, while walking on the side
walk, slipped, and in falling threw out
his hand to save himself, receiving the
full force of the fall upon his hand.
His arm was broken at the wrist, and
also midway between the wrist and
elbow.

Letter from J. C. Harding.
J. C. Harding, who left Atnador
county last month, sends us some notes
of his travels from La Connor,. Wash
ington. He left San Francisco Novem
ber 22, on the steamer Umatilla. bound
for northern ports. He suffered from
sea sickness on the voyage. The vessel
was detained for examination by the
quarantine officers of British Columbia,
on reaching Victoria, but soon released
on finding everything satisfactory on
board from a sanitary standpoint.
Passing by Port Townsend, which
built on high land, presented a grand
view, he at length reached Seattle. . He
speaks in glowing terms of. the thrift
and enterprise everywhere manifest in
that city, and the evidences, in its
port crowded with shipping from all
parts of the world," of a vast foreign
commerce. The writer sends greeting
to his friends in this county, and in
tends visiting British Columbia and
Oregon, and promises in future to give
details of interest in his travels. We
shall bo glad to receive further com
munications containing his views of
places for the benefit of our readers. *

Constable Gray yesterday brought
over a prisoner from Sutter Creek,
named Antone Cabona, to serve a term
of 100 days in tho county jail for steal
ing ore from the Central Eureka mine.
His conviction was brought about in a
singular manner. Cabona is a married
man, and was employed as a miner at
the Contral Eureka. His matrimonial
life was not without its disagreements,
and occasionally their quarrels waxed
fast and furious. On Sunday last one
of their violent disputes occurred, the
outcome being that^ the wife left the
house, and Cabona put in his time in
the afternoon in treating somo gold
over the kitchen stove. The woman
got back to her home that evening, but
the following day another tempest
swept the matrimonial sea. This time
the wife deemed the conduct of her
spouse merited retaliation on her part,
so she hied away to the constable and
informed him that her husband had in
dulged in some mining on his own ac
count to the detriment of the Central
Eureka Company. She told the of
ficer where some rich rock had been
concealed in the cellar. The superin
tendent was promptly notified, and a
search warrant was secured. The con
stable started prospecting operations
in the cellar of Cabona's home, and
after sinking two feet came upon a lot
of specimen rock, valued at $50. Ca
bona was cornered and pleaded guilty
to a charge of petty larceny, and is
paying for his pranks in attempting a
short cut to wealth by a stay of 100
days at the county boarding house.

SAN FRANCISCO. CAL.
Obituary.
A young man, John Andreasovich,
died at Perovich's boarding house on
the eleventh, after a three . weeks' ill
ness of pneumonia. He was only 21
years of age, and of remarkable physi
cal proportions, being six feet four
inches in height. He was employed at
the Zcila mine. The funeral took
place Sunday, being delayed to permit
the arrival of the deceased's brother
from Los Angeles. The remains were
interred in the Catholic cemetery, Rev.
J. J. Gleason conducting the services.
A. A. Clough, an old resident of Gait,
and a pioneer of Amador county, died in
Gait last week of cancer of tho Intes
tines. Deceased came to California in
1860, and settled at Pine Grove. He
moved to Gait in 1870, and resided
there continuously up to the time of
his death. 'He leaves a widow and
three children.
A Profitable Crop.
The vineyardists of "Amador county
have enjoyed a fair measure of pros
perity for several years past, the price
of grapes having enabled them to rea
lize fair profits. A few years back
grapes were a drug in the market, and
the prices ruling loft nothing for the
growers. Of late years they have
proven one of the most profitable of
crops. For several years there has
been no trouble in getting $20 per ton
for wine grapes. A vineyard properly
kept, with vines in full ' bearing,- will
1 yield two tons to the acre, making an
income of $40 per acre. Lorenzo Arata
has four acres in vines, and has gather
ed about four tons this year. G. A.
Douet, of Clinton, probably the largest
vineyardist in the county, has -a fine
crop this year, and expects to make
10,000 gallons of wine, also considerable
brandy from the refuse. Better prices
have ruled for both wine and brandy
than in former years.
A Woman's Awful Peril.
' 'There is only one chance to save
your life and that is through an opera
tion, " were the startling words heard
by Mrs. I. B. Hunt of Lime Ridge,
Wis., from her doctor after he had
vainly tried to cure her of a frightful
case of stomach trouble and yellow
jaundice. Gall stones had formed and
she constantly grew worse. Then she
began to use, Electric Bitters, which
wholly cured herj It's a wonderful

Two Circus Feats.
"A great deal of unnecessary sym
pathy is wasted upon the circus man
who stands up -. proudly '. in spangled
tights and lets another circus man
bring down a slwlge "hninnier upon a
rock placed upon his head with force
enough to break It," says an old circus
man. "This Is spectacular, but Is en
tirely; painless and calls for no gerat
strength or end iirance." ; Upon the cra
nium of the strong man is put an Iron
contrivance weighing about 150 pounds
and provided with cushions both above
and where it rests upon the head. A
pretty good sized rock Is used, and the
hammer is a heavy one, so you can see
that the blow that cracks the rock Is
really a serious one. But most of the
force is taken up by the rock and the
rest by the Iron and cushions, while
the only sensation felt by the subject
is a gentle tap.
"No more difficult than this is the
act whereby the hero of the canvas
tent permits a rock to be broken upon
•his chest with a blow from a sledge
hammer. So long as the subject's back
is free and does not rest against any
solid object the trick Is perfectly sim
ple. A little illustration: Take a board
up and let it lie freely In your band
and hit it smartly with a hammer. It
is difficult to hurt your hand, and the
thicker the board the less the sensa
tion. But now put your band on the
table and hit the board. Hurts, doesn't
it? Well, It's the same with the rock
on the chest." -
How Our Ancestors Quarreled.
A study 'of mediaeval rural life is apt
to give the Impression that the princi
pal part of the life of the people was
spent In quarreling or in the commis
sion or prosecution of offenses. Our
ancestors certainly were a very liti
gious and a very disorderly people.
The records teem with Instances of men
and women drawing knives against one
another, of breaking Into bouses, of
prosecuting one another for slander.
Then we have such entries as these:
"It is ordained by common consent
that all the women of the village must
refrain their tongues from all slander
ing." "Thomas, son of Robert Smith,
is fined 12 pence because bis wife Ag
nes beat Emma, the wife of Robert
the tailor, and Robert, the tailor, six
pence because his wife Emma swore at
Agnes, the wife of Thomas." "It is en
joined upon all the tenants of the vil
lage that none of them attack any oth
ers in word or deed, with clubs or ar
rows or knives under penalty of paying
40 shillings.",
Such entries, frequently occurring. In
addition to the Innumerable instances
of Individual attack, slander, petty,
theft and other Immorality seem to
show a community of far from perfect
virtue.— Lipplncott's.
Italians Love Tomatoes.
Italians more than any other people
value tomatoes, and each one that
comes to perfection is as carefully tend
ed as though it were an apple of gold.
Not only do the housewives delight In
the fresh vegetables themselves, but,
generally sponUlng. those home tended
are better than any purchased at the
market, and so each one is jealously
saved to make totnatoe sauce for the
spaghetti, without which no Italian
Sunday would be Sunday. One soapbox
gardener one season sold enough toma
toes to give Ikt quite a little pin uiouey.
No oue who knows the Italian well will
be surprised to learn thai inauy of the
luixes are devoted to peppers, for they.
In truth furnish much of their spice of
life, and even the little Italian girls
kuow how to stuff and cook them In a
dozen different ways that tempt the
palate.— Boston Transcript

A NOVEL HOTEL BILL.
The Mail to Whom It Was Presented
Could Not linderstand It.
"Talking about bookkeeping, there
used to be a man In Yankton whose
system of bookkeeping accounts was
wonderfully efficient. He kept a hotel,
and 1;p could neither read oor r wrlte.
He dki uoi Li:ow how to spell his own
name, but he did a thriving business
and collected every dollar of his ac
counts. Once, years ago, when I first
came to this country, I went to his ho
tel and stopped there two weeks,"
writes Milt Brinben.
"When I left, he presented me with a
statement of what I owed him, and it
was a curiosity. He had copied it from
his ledger. At the top of the sheet
there was a rude picture of a soldier
on the march and after it three straight
marks. Then there was a scene show
ing a man at table . eating. Then ap
peared a bed with a man in it. In the
amount column there was a picture of
a doll and 'after it the two letters "ES."
After the picture of a man eating there
were forty-two marks; after the view
of the man in the bed, fourteen marks.
I looked (if the account, then at the
proprietor, ;....! \A& him It would take
me a week to answer that conundrum.
"I was completely stumped, and when
that hotel man deciphered the amount
for me It was this: The picture of the
soldier walking meant march, and the
three marks supplied the date, March
3, when I began boarding. The man
at the table with forty-two marks after
it indicated that I had eaten forty-two
meals. The man in bed with fourteen
marks showed that I had slept in the
house . fourteen nights. The doll .with
the 'RS' after it meant 'dollars,' and
in the figure columns appeared the fig
ures 14, which was the amount I owed
him. And it was a true bill."—Yank

A Persian Barber.
A "Persian barber works In a style
very different from that in v^>gue In
this country. A typical shop Is a
square room, with one side open to the
street. Iv the center is a tiny bed of
flowers sunk in the floor, from the
middle of which rises an octagonal
stove column about three feet high.
The capital of the column forms , a
receptacle for the water in which the
barber dips his hand as he shaves his
customer's scalp. In Persia they do
not lather. The shop is very clean. In
two recesses stand four vases filled
with flowers and the implements of the
barber's art— scissors, razors, lancets,
hand mirrors, large pinchers to extract
teeth, branding irons to cauterize the
arteries in amputating limbs, strong
combs, but not a hairbrush," for that
implement is never used by Persians. |
From the ] barber's girdle hang a
round copper water bottle, his strop,
and a pouch to hold his instruments.
In his bosom is . a small mirror, the
presentation of which to his customers
is a sign that the Job is. finished and
that the barber waits for his pay. The
barber shaves the heads of his custom
ers, dyes their beards, pulls their teeth,
blisters and bleeds them when ailing,
sets their broken bones and shampoos
their bodies. — Exchange.
Strange Lapse of Memory,
Cases of forgetfulness on matters of
interest are on record. While. Dr.
Priestley was preparing his work en
titled "Harmony of the Gospels" he
had taken great pains to inform him
self on a subject which had been under
discussion relative to the Jewish Pass
over. He wrote out the. result of his
researches and laid the paper away.
His attention and ■ time being taken
with something else, some little time
elapsed before the subject occurred to
his mind again. Then the same time
and pains were given to the : subject
that had been given to it before, and
the results were again put on paper
and laid aside. So completely had he
forgotten that he had copied the same
paragraphs and reflections before that
It was only when he had found the
papers on which he had transcribed
them that It was recalled to his recol
lection. This same author had fre
quently read his own published writ
ings and did not recognize them.

A LIVING BAROMETER.
The Crabllke Spider That Poses aa
Vncatnn's Weather Sharp.
. In. Yucatan, a land of. many curiosi
ties, there Is a living barometer in the
form of a small spider, called "am" on
account of the effect produced by Its
poi=on. As far as Its own conduct goes,'
the insect is inoffensive and can be
handled with impunity, but if anybody
has the misfortune to get one mysteri
ously mixed with his food he is certain
to rile after a few hours and meanwhile
for some "unexplained reason .will fre
quently ejaculate "Am, am, am!" hence
the name of the spider. Throughout
the peninsula this Is affirmed to be a
fact, and if an am falls Into fodder of
horses or mules the animal that swal
lows it surely dies. : . :.,
. This spider is shaped , like a crab,
minus the claws, and is of a bright yel
low color, with brown spots; the big
gest could be accommodated upon a
silver dime. Its favorite abode :is
among the leaves of the banana shrub,
commonly, but erroneously, called tree.
There It spins with extreme rapidity,
.its web, which Is prodigiously large,
considering . the size of Its architect,
and proceeds to devour the flies that
are unlucky enough to get . entangled
in the meshes of this astonishing little
glutton, that Is not satisfied with less
than a dozen a day— that is to say, it
consumes, a good deal ; more, than its
own bulk. Its progeny is -numerous
and appears at first like more black
specks, smaller than the smallest pin's
head.
The sky may be blue and cloudless
when suddenly the am commences tak
ing in its sails, or, rather, gathering in
Its net, with neatness and dispatch,
cramming the whole of the material
Into its diminutive body entirely out of
sight. A few minutes completes the
Job, and the spider takes np Its posi
tion on the under surface of one of the
great leaves to be lulled by the gentle
swaying and sheltered while the storm
rages. It Is for this that the am has
prepared, and never is It mistaken.
When the web Is taken In, rain will
certainly fall within an hour.
The moment the am is touched It
feigns death and lets Itself drop, show
ing no sign of lffe until again placed
upon a leaf or on the ground. Many a
one has lain In the palm of the writer's
hand Inert, ail its legs drawn close to
its body, while it was examined at
leisure, even being picked up in the
fingers ' without its manifesting any
life. > .--i.--: ■'.■:.
BEAUTY SPOTS.
Try lemon Juice for whitening the
neck. Apply It with a linen cloth. •
: After the head has been shampooed,
whenever possible, give the head a sun
bath.
A writer states that oily hands may
be made comfortable and touchable by
wetting them once or twice A day while
clean with cologne, alcohol or toilet
vlnegar.» ' . '
A good circulation Is essential to the
growth of the hair as well as to Its col
or and fineness. A frequent, vigorous
brushing with a stiff brush is the best
method of obtaining this.
A writer upon the complexion says
the best way to treat freckles, a sure
cure in all but very obstinate cases' Is
to touch them night and morning with
a camel's hair brush after dipping it In
lemon Juice. ~~ — ■
For a graasy skin nothing Is better
than the combination of an ounce of
dried rose leaves, half a pint of white
wine vinegau and half a pint of rose
water. Let the vinegar stand on the
rose leaves for a week, then add the
rosewater. Use a tablespoonful In a
cup of distilled water.
A Geological Fallacy.
Probably the most wild and unjusti
fiable of all the crude beliefs respect-
Ing geological resources is that which
holds to the conviction that by going
deep enough the drill Is sure to find
something of value, no matter at what
point the work of boring is commenced.
I \ There are numerous wise persons In
every community, estimable, Influen
tial and in the highest degree public
spirited who are convinced that the
question, for example, of finding coal
In their special locality is simply a
matter of the depth to which the ex
plorations are carried. Rock oil and
natural gas are recognized as desirable
products In every progressive commu
nity, and every such community con
tains persons in other respects intelli
gent who are ready to stake their own
fortune and that of their nearest
friends on the belief that oil and gad
are everywhere underneath the surface
and that their sources can be tapped
with the drill provided only there Is
sufficient capital to keep np the process
of drilling long enough.— Mines and
Minerals.
Professional Shoppers.
Professional shoppers are employed
by a certain large 'firm of London
drapers to test the abilities of shop as
sistants. This firm owns over thirty
large shops and employs nearly 1,000
assistants. To find out whether every
customer Is politely served a number
of lady customers are employed to call
at the various shops. They are told to
give as much trouble as possible and
sometimes to leave without making a
purchase after looking at nearly every
thing In the shop. Should the unfortu
nate assistant's temper not be equal
to the strain, or should a single word
be said that might offend, a report will
Infallibly reach headquarters and lead
to the dismissal of the sorely tried
handler of silks and ribbons, i

A~QU£BTggy>lF TEETH.
Did the Immortal George Wear Ar
' ttacia.l or Natural OnesT
"George Wasblagtoji's false teeth,
which were supposed to have been
made of Ivory, aie giving a certain
class of freak historians about as much
trouble as they must have given the
venerable patriot who wore them,"
said one of the professors : of . the
Smithsonian institution to a reporter
recently. •
"Many times a year for several years
this Institution has been called upon to
produce these mysterious teeth for the
inspection of persons who insist that
they are here. |
"Our matter of fact answer to these
inquiries that Washington bad no false
teeth, or at least if he did, that they
are not In the possession of the mu
seum, seems only to stimulate the in
quiring mind to protest our statement.
They proceed to give us authentic ac
counts of these teeth and always con
clude with expressing the belief that
they must be in the museum some
where. .
"Where or how the idea that Wash
ington had false teeth originated is an
unsolved mystery. That it Is firmly be
lieved by many is certainly a fact
There seems to be no authentic record
of the Father of His Country possess
ing ivory teeth, and by a study of the
bust we have of him, which was made
but' a few years before his death, there
is no indication of an Indentation along
the line of the gums such as can be
noticed In persons who have had their
teeth drawn, even though they wear
artificial ones. However, we will con
tinue to answer the same question la
the same way probably many times In
the future."
According to some . biographers
Washington lost his teeth during his
service as commander in chief of the
Continental army and had a set of
ivory ones made. These teeth, it is
also stated, gave him much trouble be
cause they did not fit— Washington
Star.
RAILWAY RUMBLES.
Ireland claims the honor of the first
electric railway In the United King'
dom.
It Is said that the cheapest railway
fares in the world are to be found Id
Hungary.
Denmark has a government railroad
system of 1,167 miles and 525 miles of
private railroads.
The Servian, Roumanian and Bulgs/
rlan railroads are owned exclusively
by the respective governments.
Travelers on Prussian railways whose
baggage, through no fault of their
own, fails to arrive with them can now
have it sent on request frp'e to their
houses.
The difficulty of railway construction
In some parts of Africa is illustrated
by the fact that on the Freetown-Mat
tru line, In Sierra Leone, eleven steel
bridges had to be built In a distance of
only thirty kilometers.
A representative of the Paris Temps
has been examining railway stations In
Germany, and he declares that those of
Dresden, Cologne, Hanover, Frankfort,
Bremen, etc., are far superior to any
of the French except the Parisian.
Paying a Creditor.
Like many another famous man both
before his time and since, Talleyrand
exhibited, at least in early life, a great
reluctance to settling with his credit
ors. When he was appointed bishop of
Antun by Louis XVI., he considered a
fine new coach to be necessary to the
proper maintenance of the dignity of
that office. Accordingly a coach was
ordered and delivered, but not paid for.
Some time after, as the newly appoint
ed bishop was about to enter his coach,
he noticed a strange man standing near
who bowed continually until the coach
was driven away. This occurred for
several days until at length Talley
rand, addressing the stranger, said:
"Well, my good man, who are you?"
"I am your coachmaker, my lord,"
replied the stranger.
"Ah," said Talleyrand, "you are my
coachmaker! And what do you want,
my coachmaker?"
"I want to be paid, my lord.".
"Ah, yon are my coachmaker, and
you want to be paid? Ton shall be
paid, my coachmaker."
"But when, my lord?"
"Hum," said Talleyrand, settling
himself comfortably among the cush
ions of his new coach and eying his
coachmaker severely, "you are very
inquisitive."
Bating; Good Sense.
Even men are progressing gastronom
ically. Scientific dietetics has at last
revealed to us the fact that the woman
who eats salad on a hot day In July,
August or September Is ' displaying
sound gastronomic sense, says What to
Eat The long haired dreamer In the
restaurant may have been nineteen dif
ferent kinds of a fool upon every other
proposition in life, but he knew what
to eat on a hot day. The human ani
mal needs grass cr Its equivalent In
summer. With their oil the salads sup
ply everything a man physically needs
in hot weather. All the civilized races
of the world are salad eaters, but Amer
icans eat less than do any other people.
It Is not a sign of mental decay or mor
al degeneracy for a man to eat salad; it
Is gastronomic sense.
Harpers Ferry.
Harpers Ferry was named after
Robert Harper, an architect and mill
builder, born la 1703 In the town of
Oxford, England. He came to Amer
ica In 1735 with hfe brother Joseph
and located in Philadelphia, where for
a time he prospered but, failing later,
concluded to join the Friends of I<ou
doun county, Va. En route to his new
home he came upon .the gap In the
Blue Ridge mountains, where he made
his home.
