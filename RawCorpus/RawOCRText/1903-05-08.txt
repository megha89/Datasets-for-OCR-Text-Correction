JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY. CALIFORNiA, FRIDAY. MAY 8. 1903.
DRESDEN CHINA.
First Offered For Sale tit the Fnlr
of lidpslo In 1721.
Dresden china began Its reign at tho
fair of I/elpstc, 1721, where It was of
fered for public sale for the first time.
It has had three periods— King's, Slar
collne and modern— aud for all around
use It continues to be the most popular
ware of thlß day.
The factory marks traced on the bot
tom of each piece vary according to the
period— the oldest (King's) being (lie
monogram A. B. and the wand of .53s
culoplus. The familiar crossed swords,
with the dot or circle between the ban
dies, were first used In 1721, and the
star took the place of the dot in tlie
Marcolliie period. The modern mark Is
the simple crossed swords, sometimes
accompanied by letters and numbers.
Although the methods of work are
still Jealously guarded In all factories,
the essentials are an open sei-ret, and
the following rough outline niny satis
fy the lazily -curious:. The ingredients
of porcelain are kaolin feldspar, sand
and selenite. These are ground tine and
mixed In Umewater. Tho paste Is then
molded Into forms and fired in an oven
of moderate heat. When taken out, it
is iv an opaque state aud is then dipped
in the glaze, which Is feldspar ground
fine, with a little alkali. It is now sub
jected to a firing of great. heat which
results' In the beautiful polished sur
face so familiar the world over. -
This Beeond firing Is attended with
risk, for if the piece Is allowed to re
main beyond the exact proper moment
the whole melts together and Is ruined.
Hovr a Glaits Ere Aclx.
A glass eye has never so free a range
of movement as the real one, and when
the owner turns his eyes strongly in
any direction the glass eye lags behind
the other, so producing a squint. Then
the pupil of the glass eye is of course
of a fixed size, while the natural pupil
dilates and contracts not only with
varying amounts of light, but with
varying emotions. Then again the
white of the eye varies in lint greatly
from day to day, being slightly blood
shot during headaches and yellow dur
ing bilious attacks. The differences in
color between the two eyes caused by
these changes are even more easily no
ticed than the differences in the pupils.
The Camel's Bite.
The camel alone of all ruminants has
Incisor teeth in the upper jaw, which,
with the peculiar structure of his other
teeth, make his bite, the animal's first
and main defense, most formidable.
The skeleton of the camel is full of
proofs of design. Notice, for. example,
the arched backbone, constructed in
such a way as to sustain the greatest
weight in proportion to the span of. the
supports. A strong camel can bear a
thousand pounds weight although the
usual load in Yemen Is not more than
600 pounds.

Perfect Respiration.
. For perfect respiration two things
are necessary— chest capacity .an 6.
breath control. The average individual,
woman especially, uses but a limited
portion of the lungs and upper chest
In ordinary breathing. . -Whenever a
little unusual physical effort makes de
mand for an extra breathing capacity,
note how she puffs and pants, almost
to a point of gasping. Tho reason for
this Is that the muscles of the lower
chest, waist and abdomen have become
well nigh atrophied through neglect
and abuse. They are stiff and unre
sponsive and have now to be coaxed
back to a condition of activity and
obedience.
It Is quite as possible to educate
these muscles so thut they shall re
spond to our slightest demand as It Is
that our hands are trained to do our
bidding. Different teachers will advo
cate different forms of breathing—up
per chest, side chest, lower chest and
abnormal breathing— but " what we
most want ' Is absolute control, such
control of the iauscles as shall enable'
us to make use of any desired form of
breathing at the word of command, for
all forms have special values. Full up
per chest breathing Is used most, but
lower chest and abdominal breathing
are very valuable in cases of nervous
ness, indigestion, stomach and bowel
troubles.
An Old nectpe.
Here is a recipe for the bite of a mafl
dog taken from the "Universal Maga
zine of Knowledge,", published by John
Hlnton at the King's Arms in Newgate
street, London, May, 1753: "Take the
youngest shoots of the elder tree, peel
oil the outside rind, then, scraping off
the green j rind, take two handfuls of
It, which simmer a quarter of an hour
In five pints of ale. Strain It off and
when cold put It in bottles. Take
half a pint, make warm the first thing
In the morning and the last at night
and be sure to keep yourself warm;
also buthe the part affected with some
of the liquor warmed, the dose to be
repeated the next new or full moon
after the first. It Is good for cattle as
well as the human species."
Whims of a Horse.
The better the horse the nipre spirit
he has. The disposition of an Arab
hunter Is thus described by Sewell
Ford In "Horses Nine:" No paragon,
however, was Pasha. He had a tem
per, and his whims were as many as
those of a schoolgirl. He was particu
lar as to who put on his bridle. He had
notions concerning the manner In
which a currycomb should be used. A
red ribbon or a bandanna handkerchief
put him In a rage, while green, the holy
color of the Mohammedan, soothed his
nerves. A lively pair of heels he had,
and he knew how to use his teeth.
Animals In Fire.
When Cyprus was the center of the
copper Industry, it is asserted that a
four footed animal with wings lived in
the hottest furnaces among the tire and
TnriiicriDore'Tnat rrwoura are nistnunjr
upon being removed from Its natural
clement, the flames. The salamander
of old was also a creature which did
not dread the fire. Some say that It
could eat fire and spit flames, others
that Its breath would Ignite all combus
tibles. Pliny says, "This animal is bo
Intensely cold as to -extinguish fire by
its contact in the same way that ice
doth." ;
Litigants' Requisites.
An old English solicitor used to say
a man's requirements for going to law
were ten in number, and he summed
them up as follows: First, plenty of
money; secondly, plenty of patience;
-thirdly, a good case; fourthly, a good
solicitor; fifthly, plenty of money;
sixthly, a good counsel; seventhly, a
good witness; eighthly, a good Jury;
ninthly, a good Judge; tenthly, plenty
of money.
Badly Behind Time.
"Charley, dear," said young Mrs. Tor
kins, "isn't it a pity that the morning
newspapers are so much behind time?"
"In what respect?"
j "Why, they never print the name of
the winner of a horse race until the
I next day, when It is too late to bet"

STARTING A TRADE.
|ke K»w England Peddler and tne
Secret of Bis Success.
"Peddlln's a great business. The se
cret of It Is that you must do a trade,
even U It hurts your principles, when
there's a possible chance. I remember
.Sow I once managed with an old fel
low who wouldn't hey nothln' to do
with me. ; He was so confident an' surd
he warn't goln' to trade that I made up
my mind he'd got to. I've got wooden
nutmegs, pocket sawmills,' says I, 'an*
torn gun flints, basswood hams, tin
bungboles, calico hog troughs,' white
oak cheeses an' various other articles
too numerous to mention, lnclndln' of
cast Iron ratholes, an' If any of them
ain't big enough to answer Til knock
the bottom out of a.fryln' pan, an'
that'll let any rat through that yoa've
got, I guess. Whoopr Bays I. I'm Tom

old 'man Just looked on and sbuk his*
head. 'I'll take pewter, copper, elnc. Iron,
rags— anything,' says I, 'exceptln' mon
ey an' old maids.' Bat the old man on'y
Bhuk his head.
"I Just simply had to start a trade.
1 saw a pair of old boots, an' X Bald
them was Jnst what I wanted. 'What?
he says. 'D'ye buy old boots? an* I
said them was my partlckler specialty.
'How much d'ye give?' he asks, an' I
says, 'Half a cent a pound, *s long a,s
half cents is coined,' says I. He didn't
take no heed of my meanin', but begin
to rummagy round and git out three
or four pair. They warn't no good to
Newton, but I was startln' a trade.
'Now, hain't yer got some rags? I says.
Them was what I asked fer first, an'
the old miser said he didn't hey none,
but now, stirred up by the chanst of
glttin' somethln' fer his old boots, he
brought out seventeen pound of rags,
an' we done a brisk bit of tradin' fer

KNOWING TOO MUCH.
Some Serious Drawbacks to the
Pleasures of Conversation.
One very serious drawback to our
pleasure lv conversation with a too
well informed person is the nervous
strain that Is involved. We are always
wondering what will happen when he
comes to the end of his resources. Aft
er listening to one who discourses with
surprising accuracy upon any particu
lar topic we feel a delicacy In changing
the subject. It seems a mean trick,
like suddenly removing the chair on
which a guest is about to sit down for
the evening; With one who is interest
ed In a great many things he knows
little about there Is no such difficulty.
If he lias passed the first flush of
.routh. It no longer embarrasses him to
be 'caught now and then in a mistake.
Indeed van r correction >a- »r t ijyinwt -w
an agreenble-iuieriui»t.v««-anu serves
as a starting point for a new series of
observations.
The pleasure of conversation Is en
hanced if one feels assured not only ol
wide margins of Ignorance, but also of
the absence of any uncanny quickness
of mind.
I should not like to be a neighbor to
a wit It would be like being In prox
imity to a live wire. A certain Insulat
ing film of kindly stupidity is needed
to give a margin of safety to human in
tercourse. There are certain minds
whose processes convey the impression
of alternating currents of high voltage
on a wire that Is not quite large enough
for them. From such I would with
draw myself.
One is freed from all such apprehen
sions In the companionship of people
who make no pretensions to any kind
of cleverness. "The laughter of fools
Is like the crackling of thorns under a
pot" What cheerful sounds— the crack
ling of the dry thorns and the merry
bubbling of the pot!— S. M. Crothers In
Atlantic.
The Site of the White Home,
The Bite for the president's palace,
as the first maps name it, was selected
by President Washington and Major
I/Enfant when they laid out the fed
eral city in 1702. They proposed to
have the president's house and the cap
itol reciprocally close to the long vista
formed by Pennsylvania avenue, and
they also laid out a parkll&e connection
between the two great buildings. The
plans for the house, selected by Wash
ington and Jefferson as the result of a
competition in which I/Enfant took
part, were drawn by James Hoban, a
native of Dublin and a medal man of
the Society of Arts of that city.—

SAILOR AND HORSE.
Bow tne Retired Sea Captain Mode
a Purchase.
In "Hones Nine" Sewell fford tells
how a retired sea captain bought a
horse. The story runsi Aa ono who In
spects an unfamiliar object Captain
Bean looked dazedly at Barnacles. At
the same time Barnacles inspected the
captain. With head lowered to knee
level, with ears cocked forward, nos
trils sniffing and under lip twitching
almost as It he meant to laugh, Bar
nacles eyed his prospective owner.
Captain Bean squirmed under the
gaze of Barnacles' big, calm eye for a
moment, and then shifted his position.
"What In time does he want any
way, Jed?" demanded the captain.
"Wants to git acquainted, that's all,
cap'n. Mighty knowin' hoss, he Is.
Now, some hosses don't take notice of
anything. They're Jest naturally dumb.
Then ag'ln you'll flnd hosses that seem
to ■ hnow - «TCTy * blamed" ir«?rd "ywtt " Baf .
Them's the kind of hosses that's wuth
havin'." . ■
"S'pose he knows all the ropes, Jed?'
"I should say he did, cap'n. If there's
anything that hoss ain't done in his
day, I don't know what 'tis. Ncar*s I
can find out he's tried every kind of
work, in or out of traces, that <yon
could think of."
"Must be some old by your tell," sug
gested the captain. "Sure his timbers
are all sound?"
"Dunno 'bout his timbers, cap'n, but
as fer wind an' limb you won't find a
Bounder hoss of his age Jn this county.
Course I'm not seIUV him fer a four
year-old."
Again Captain Bean tried to look
critically at the white horse, but once
more he met that calm, curious gaze,
and the attempt was hardly a success.
However, the captain squinted solemn
ly over Barnacles' withers and re
marked:
"Yes, he has got some good lines, as
you say, though you wouldn't hardly
call him clipper built Not much sheer
forward an' a leetle too much aft, eh?"
"At this criticism Jed snorted mirth
fully.
"Oh, I s'pose he's all right," quickly
added the captain. "Fact is I ain't
never paid much attention to horses,
beln* on the water so much. You're
sure he'll mind his helm, Jed?"
"Oh, he'll go where you pint him."
"Won't drag anchor, will he?'
"Stand all day if you'll let him."
"Well, Jed, I'm ready to sign arti
cles, I guess."
ORIGIN OF OLD SAYINGS.
The Honeymoon.— For thirty days
after a wedding the ancient Teutons
had a custom of drinking a mead made
of honey.
The Bridegroom.— ln primitive times
the newly wedded man had to wait
upon bis bride and the guests on his
wedding day. He was their groom. '
u»e greatly pleased with a roast loin of
beef set before him, declared it "good
enough to be knighted." It has ever
since been called Sir Loin.
A Spinster.— Women were prohibited
from marrying In olden times until
they had spun a full set of bed fur
nishings-on the spinning wheel; hence,
till married, they were spinsters.
Cabal.— This word was coined In
Charles ll.'s reign and applied to his
cabinet council. It was made out of
the initials of their names, which were:
Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ash
ley, Lauderdale.
Scandinavian Carving.
From earliest times carving has re
ceived great attention In Scandinavia.
One sees evidence of this in many Swe
dish churches, both in wood and stone,
dating back many centuries. In Stock
holm are many to be found, now safe
ly cared for In a well known museum.
Some of these northern churches, nota
bly those of Borgund and Hitterdal,
are quite covered with such quaint or
namentation. Beyond such public ex
pression of painstaking labor one may
see In almost any comfortably furnish
ed house wooden forks, spoons, salt
boxes and platters, but still more at
tracting attention are huge wooden
tankards, and these will often bear
close study both in design and in exe
cution.
Red Flannel Currency.
A Scotch missionary to a group of
small islands in the south Pacific a
great many years ago found bits of red
flannel circulating as money. This cur
rency came to them in a curious man
ner. The body of a shipwrecked sailor
had^Qrif ted ashore, and to the untu
tored savages, who had never before
seen clothing of any kind, his red flan
nel shirt was an object of wonder and
admiration. By common consent they
cut the garment Into small pieces,
which thenceforth became the curren
cy of the Island.

The Truthful Pioneer.
"One* day," said the truthful pioneer, 1
"I was whacking up some wood, down
by the creek, and ten Indians loome/j
up. They were pretty thirsty even for
Indians, and they said they knew I
had a jug somewhere, and they want
ed to sample It I had a log about half
split at the time, and the ax was stick
ing In it I told them If they would
help me get that log in two I would
show them where the jug was. So> they
took hold, five on one side and five on
the other, and pulled. And wfcen I
took the ax out the log sprung together
and held them all by the fingers,' Then
I walked away to the house and} loaded
the shotgun and three or four pistols
and then went back and argued with
them, and they reformed right away."
This story, says the Nebraska State
Journal, was originally told of Daniel
Boone or Davy Crockett and! has. done
good service ever since. It Is not copy
righted, however, and there Is no good
reason -#by Nebraska pioneers should
not use It
The TFlld Giraffe.
Perhaps the most difficult of all wild
animals to capture Is the giraffe. In
addition to being very rare giraffes are
exceedingly timid and are very swift
footed. There is no special way to cap
ture a giraffe, as almost every way has
been tried, and all have been almost
equally unsuccessful. The method which
has occasionally resulted In a capture
Is by using a long cord, at each end of
which la a round weight This cord is
thrown by the hunter in such a manner
as to wind round the animal's legs,
either bringing It to the ground or ren
dering it incapable of escaping before
it is made a prisoner. Most of the
giraffes in captivity have been caught
by chance when young.
Lovemaklnar In Mexico.
In northwest Mexico the courting Is
all done by the lady. The young people
meet at the feasts, and there the dam
sel who has fixed upon a member of
the opposite sex whom she wishes to
become her husband tries to attract his
attention by dancing before him, per
sistently keeping her back turned to
ward him. Eventually she may sit
down near him and pull his blanket
and sing to him in a gentle, low voice.
When she desires to bring matters to a
focus, she begins to throw pebbles at
the chosen one. If he throws them
back at her, they are betrothed.
Eye* With Double Pnpila.
Cicero says that "the glance of all
women with the double pupil In the eye
Is noxious, blighting -and withering."
Cadmus tells us that such persons
would not drown. Still others say that
if they did drown the body would nev
er sink, neither wqnld it decay. They
could cure the disease of the chest
consumption—by rubbing their perspi
ration on the affected parts of the indi
vidual, and in case the. double pupils
were red instead of black they could
cure the lepers and the blind.

Queer African Mask.
Grotesque masks are worn in many
parts of Africa during dances and reli
gious . ceremonies. The reason Is be
cause a symbolic significance Is at
tached to them and they are especially,
supposed to possess the power of pre
serving those who wear them from the
Influence of evil spirits.
The masks are generally made 'of
wood, and some are carved with rare
skill. When a chief or. the head of a
family dies, he leaves bis mask to bia
successor, and the latter is bound to
wear it In every village there Is aa
artist who repairs masks and occasion
ally makes a few new ones, and it Is
said that no one does a more thriving
business than he.
Ethnologists have been trying to find
out the exact time when these masks
first came Into use, but all they have
learned as yet is that they have been
popular in Africa for many centuries.

no exception in na-
ture to the rule that beauty depends on J
health.
Women who see their beauty waning
rarely associate the external change
with failure of the womanly health.
They do not understand the close rela-
tion of the general physical . health to
the health of the delicate womanly or-
ganism, until after being cured of wom-
anly diseases by the use of Dr. Pierce't
Favorite Prescription they find the color
returning to the cheek and the flesh to
the body.
"Favorite Prescription" establishes
regularity, dries weakening drains, heal*
inflammation and ulceration and cures
female weakness.
"Several years ago I was very poorly,' write;
Mrs. May Kelley, of Sylvia, Kans., «so weak I
could hardly walk across the floor, and at tunes
suffered Mverrly. I took two bottles of Dr.
pierces Favorite Prescription and got well and
hardy— gained twelve pounds in two month*
and was the picture of health. Your medicines
have cured me. Almost everybody I meet says,
• You look so much better than you have tat
several years ; you look well now." "
"Favorite Prescription" makes weak
women strong', sick women well. Ac-
cept no substitute for the medicine
which works wonders for weak women.
Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets are a
lady's laxative. Nothing equals them
for gentleness and thoroughness.THE AMADOR LEDGER

TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Wa look to the friends of the Ledger to keep
us posted concerning events of public interest
S happening in any part of the county. Our reg
• alar correspondents will be furnished with
- ' writing material and stamps for this purpose.
Births, deaths, marriages, accidents, amuse
ments, mining and other Industrial progress,
" social topics, new buildings, persons leaving
■ or coming into the county, are always accept-
able. Give details of important items, no
- matter in how rough a shape. Avoid personal
'•' remarks that might give offense. Visitors be-
I tween towns in the county need not be men
tioned, but visits from or to places beyond tbe
' county may be recorded.
MUST BE PUBLIC.
Section 4035 of the political code,
referring to the board of supervisors,
says:
"All meetings of the board must be
public".
How strangely at variance is this
command with the practice of going
into "executive" session, which is
getting so common in this county as
to be looked upon as a feature of
every monthly meeting of the board.
At the meeting of the board held
this week, another of these secret
sessions was held. The people of
Amador county, whose servants the
supervisors are, would like to know
what business affecting their inter
ests requires transaction, or even
discussion, with closed doors. And
in face of the above mandatory pro
vision, what right has the board, as
such, to hold any meeting without
the hearing of the public, and with
out even the presence of the clerk
or any other official. When one of
these "executive" conclaves is called,
not only' the spectators, but the
clerk and the district attorney, and
all other county officials are expect
ed to clear out of the assembly room
at the same time. The supervisors
want to be left alone with them
selves. The idea is not only in con
flict with legal requirements; it is
absurd upon its face. Think of it?
The people of Amador county have
business of such a delicate nature to
transact that they don't want to re
veal the nature of it even to them
selves. That is the logical con
clusion to be drawn from these so
called "executive" sessions. '■- And
we have no hesitation in saying" that
out a dissenting voice, will revolt
against the idea of being placed in
such a light.
NO FREE ADVERTISING.
In future, the publishers of this paper
will not insert any article, item or
notice, which in any manner will serve
as an advertisement, without charging
therefor in accordance with the ad
vertising rates, (within its classifica
tion), as are established by this paper.
— Angels Echo.
The Ledger extends the glad band
to the Echo for the decisive stand it
has taken on this proposition. It is
the only straightforward and honor
able course for a publisher to follow.
If any person has anything that he
wants published in the local paper
that is intended to be of pecuniary
benefit to him, he should be willing
to pay a fair price for the publisher's
services. If he is not willing to pay
for the service, the publisher should
have the stamina to refuse to do it
for glory. It behooves every coun
try publisher, from strictly business
considerations, and in defense of the
dignity of his calling, to adopt the
above rule. But we regret to say
that all newspaper men do not take
the same common sense view of the
matter. And while our Calaveras
county cotemporary is taking firm
ground toward the emancipation of
the profession from a crying evil, a
brother editor in Amador county is,
and has been for years past, flying
the following dishonorable proclama
tion at the head of bis columns:
The Dispatch desires to publish all
announcements of socials, festivals, etc.,
that are going on. All such notices of
entertainments will be published one
insertion free, as a matter of news.
What a contrast. The Angels
paper is striving to elevate the busi
ness, the Amador paper to degrade
and destroy it.
The superior judges of San Fran
cisco have given an opinion that is
likely to have a disquieting effect
upon those who have been divorced
and married within the last sixty
days. This time covers the period
between the passage of the new law
relating to divorces and its going
into effect. May lis the date of its
becoming operative. It was intend
ed to do away with the so-called Reno
marriages; that is the practice
which has grown to be so common of
persons, in order to evade the pro
vision of the California law requir
ing a period of one year to elapse
between divorce and remarriage, of
having the marriage ceremony per
formed in Reno immediately follow
ing the granting of a divorce in Cal
ifornia. The present law seeks to
avoid this by providing that a de
cree of divorce shall not become
absolute until after the lapse of one
year from the granting of such de
cree. The sixty days interval how
ever has been interpreted as a sort
of neutral ground. The old law was
annuled and the new law was not in
force, so it was assumed that ■ di
vorced parties could remarry',wher
ever and whenever i they pleased
within the sixty days. A rushing
business was done in most of the
counties. Now the courts have
spread consternation in the camp of
the speedy marriages by declaring
that the old law was operative dur
ing the interval. - This means that
those who have been divorced and
remarried in California are not
legally married. And they cannot
now be married according to law
until the lapse of a full year from
the granting of the divorce.
On the other hand other eminent
law expounders contend that these
marriages are not contrary to law.
And so things are pretty thoroughly
muddled. Jndges and lawyers are
at loggerheads on such a vital sub
ject as marriage. And it all comes
of the spirit of monkeying with the
laws concerning questions which
should remain fixed and stable,
which seems . to be a con tro'ling fac
tor with tbe law-making body.
■ The board of supervisors have let
a contract to put a new roof on the
court house, the material decided
upon being tin. The present roof is
of shingles. It is in a fair state of
preservation to-day, barring one or
two spots. It has done service for
seven or eight years. The water
proof character of a wood roof,
properly laid, is conceded; the only
drawback being the danger from
fire — a danger from which a public
building should be safeguarded: as
far as possible iv the nature of ! its
roofing material. Those who have
had experience with tin roofs in this
climate — where the temperature
varies during summer months as
much as 80 degrees in 24 hours— are
not enthused on the subject. The
contraction and expansion of the
metal has proved a source of con
stant' annoyance from leaks. The
strong tendency is to turn to some
other fire proof material, in prefer
ence. It is hoped the county will
meet with better success in this line
than has attended .the efforts of
private individuals.
The question whether tbe new law
providing a salary for justices and
constables is applicable to present
incumbents, is now before the court
for settlement. The issue is clean
cut on the merits of the case. James
McCauley, a justice of the peace
elected in lone, brings suit for
salary according to the provisions
of the new law. It is iikely, which
ever way the matter is decided, that
the case will be appealed to the su-
At any rate it is sincerely to be
hoped that it will reach the highest
tribunal. \ v » :

J. J. Ekel vs. W. Phillips and A. L.
Wait— On appeal from justice's court
of township five. Plaintiff sued for tbe
sum of $299.99 for damages. The com
plaint alleges that defendants, on the
evening of November 23, 1902, at the
Adams hotel in Plymouth, did by force
and violence lay hands upon plaintiff,
and took him to a building in the - rear
of the Central hotel, known as the old
bell tower, a distance of 100 yards from
the Adams hotel, a very improper
building in which to place a person,
and detained said defendant there the
entire night, exposed to cold and dark
ness, without any comforts in tho way
of fire, clothing or bedding, without
authority of law. On plaintiff's motion
for change of venue the case was trans
ferred to the justice court of township
four and tried before a jury on March
31. It was shown at the trial that
plaintiff at time of arrest was walking
up and down the floor with pistol in
hand, under the influence of liquor;
that he drew a gun on Arthur Prit
cbard and shot at him. The jury re
turned a verdict in favor of defendant.
Plaintiff appeals the case to superior
court. The cost bill of defendants
amounts to $22.60.

Beware of Ointments for Catarrh that Con-

as mercury will surely destroy the sense
of smell and completely derange the
whole system when entering it through
the mucous surfaces. Such articles
should never be used except on pro-

the damage they will do is ten-fold to
the good you can possibly derive from
them. Hall's Catarrh Cure, manufac-

Richard G. Sneath, one of the early

last, aged 77 years. He came to the
state in 1850, and first settled in Dry
town, Amador county, where he con
ducted a profitable mercantile business.
He moved to San Francisco in the early
sixties, and took a prominent part in
political and mercantile affairs. He
was one of the founders of the Mer
chant's Exchange and Producer's Ex
change of that city. ' ?

The garden seed sent out annually
by the department of agriculture is
supposed to be of choice varieties.
Some poor lots may creep in occasion
ally, but as a whole there Is no doubt
of the quality of the seed. John C.
Rader, who has a ranch on Stony
creek, brought to our office last Satur
day, a samplo of lettuce grown from
department seed received through the
Ledger office last year. It was of im
mense size, measuring over a yard in
circumference at the top. It was,
moreover, as tender and palatable as it
was large. We have still considerable
seed on hand which can be had for the
asking.
At the banquet given in honor of the
grand parlor of N. S. G. W. In Bakers
field April 30, the orator of Amador
county, John F. Davis was present,
and responded to the toast of "Sweet
hearts and wives." The toast was ap
propriately given the place of last on
the program, and we have no doubt
that with such a subject in such able
bands, the. banqueters repaired to their
respective lodgings as thrilled in mind
with eloquence as they were surfeited
physically with the good things pro-
Tided. During the evening Senator C.
M. Belahaw, also well known to Ama
dorans, responded to "Any old things."
TWO PIONEERS PASS AWAY.
* THOS. B. GREENHALUH. •
Thos. B. Greenhalgb, one of the
early pioneers of California, died at his
home in Jackson, Monday, May 4, at
the age of 75 years, 10 months and 13
days. For a couple of years the de
ceased has been very feeble, but has
been able to be about town until the
past three months, during which time
he has been confined to his home.
Mr. Greenhalgh was born In Bolton,
England, in 1827. When quite a child
he came to Fall River, Mass., where he
resided until 1848. In November of
148, in company with some two hun
dred men, be chartered a sailing vessel
and enduring the many hardships inci
dent to the voyage around Cape Horn,
landed at San Francisco February 27,
1849, and from there journeyed to Jack
son, Amador county, where he has
lived for tbe past fifty years. The
esteem in which this "Pioneer Father"
was held was manifested by the large
attendance at the funeral, which took
place from the family residence on
Court street, Wednesday, May 6, at
2 o'clock p. m. The funeral services
which were conducted by Rev. G. H.
Van Vliet of the M. E. church, were
fittingly appropriate to the memory of
one who has lived so long and promi
nently in our community.
As a last brotherly act of affection,
J. Meehan, J. Dick, C. Peters, WV P.'
Peek, H. Goldner, and G. Archer, the
remaining Jackson pioneers, attended
the funeral in a body, escorted by
Excelsior Parlor No 31, N. S. G. W.,
and Ursula Parlor No. 1, N. D. G. W.
At the grave an appropriate funeral
service was read, and kind remarks
made by J. Meehan in behalf of the
Pioneers.
As a mark of respect, not only to the
deceased but as well to the sorrowing
relatives, especially W. H, Greenhalgh,
who is prominent in the educational
interests of Amador county, the Jack
son public school was closed for the
funeral services,, and to further express
true sympathy for their co-worker and
his brother and sisters in their deep
affliction, a handsome floral piece bear
ing the teachers' card, was noticed
among the many beautiful floral
offerings.
It can truly be said that the old
Greenhalgh home is broken up, for
ten years ago the wife and mother of
the home, one of those gentle spirits
whom everyone loved, departed this
life, and now the father has gone,
leaving to mourn his death, two sons
and two daughters —W. H. Green
halgh, principal of tbe Sutter Creek
publLs school, J. J. Greenhalgh of
Tuolumne county, Mrs, B. C. O'Neill
of Jackson, and Mrs. S. A. Weriy of
Defender, and to them we extend our
sincere sympathy.
SUFUS MARION MORROW.
The funeral of R. M. Morrow, who
died May 3, took place from the M. E.
church in Jackson Tuesday afternoon,
May 5, Rev. G. H. Van Vliet officiating.
Mr. Morrow's friends were counted by
tho hundreds, and his burial was as
sisted by his neighbors from the
vicinity of his late home, together with
tho friends of his family in Jackson.
Rufus Marion Morrow was a native
of Ohio, and was born December 16,
1833. At the time of his death, May 3,
1903, he was 69 years, 4 months and 17
days old. He crossed the plains with
his parents when only thirteen years
of age, arriving in Sonoma in Septem
ber, 1846, and was present when the
Bear flag was hoisted over that; town.
Mr. Morrow was never a member of
the Pioneers, although be was one of
the state's earliest settlers. He came
to Amador county in the early sixties,
and shortly thereafter settled on Stony
creek, which place was his home until
the time of his death. On April 25,
1865, Mr. Morrow was married to Miss
Harriet Tanner, who still survives him,
together with three sons and three
daughters, and six grandchildren. Also
a sister, Mrs. Randolph, and a brother,
Chas. Morrow, of Valley Springs.
"Rufo" Morrow, as he was familiarly
addressed by his neighbors, was a kind
and loving husband and father, and
his loss will be felt by all who have
become acquainted with his good
nature and jovial disposition, and these
friends sincerely sympathize with the
family in this trying hour.
Leg Broken.
A man named A. Araya met with
a peculiar but serious accident last
Monday. Henry Weil is having an
excavation made under his store house
in the rear of his lot. The earth is
loose, having been placed there In mak
ing the excavation for his Main street
building. On Monday morning Araya
was sitting on the bank with a child in
his arms watching the men at work.
The bank was ten or twelve feet high.
Suddenly the bank where he was seated
gave way, and man and child fell into
the excavation, with tons of the loose
soil. The force of the cave struck
Araya on one leg, fracturing it in two
places. The child was covered by the
debris, but was rescued immediately,
and escaped comparatively unhurt.
Dr. Phillips was called to attend Araya,
and sot the broken limb. It will take
him a couple of months to get over his
injuries.
Off For Bine Lakes.
About twenty men left this morning
for Blue Lakes, They were obliged to
go by the way of Sacramento and
Carson. From the latter place they
will go overland to their destination.
This roundabout trip is quite expensive,
but It is impossible to go via Silver
Lake on account of the deep snow in
the mountains.
Picnic at lone.
Large crowds of Jackson people left
this morning, bound for the picnic at
lone given by the valley Rebekahs.
The day Is all that could be wished for,
and undoubtedly the dance this even-
Ing will be well patronized, as the moon
has volunteered its services to "light"
everybody home.
P. D. Delaney, formerly of this coun
ty, died In January last. Heirs of de
ceased request that any person having
any information about his will com
municate to this office. may 8-2t
THE AMADOB LEDGERS JACKSOK, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MAY 8, 1903.
LOCAL MINING NEWS
Notes From Amador County Mines.
Bright Outlook Along the Line.
Zeila. — This mine is now running
full blast. The mill Is running only
thirty of Its forty stamps. The
chlorlnation works were started up
last Friday. Fewer men are employed
underground than formerly, not merely
on account of the reduced number of
stamps In motion, but also because the
extraction of milling rock is confined at
present to about one-third of the ore
body heretofore worked. The thirty
stamps are expected to pound out as
much, If not more, gold than was ob
tained from the forty stamps when a
less rigorous selection of the ore was In
vogue.
Kennedy. — An accident happened
at this mine early Sunday morning at
the old shaft, which caused a stoppage
of work for one day. The shaft carry
ing the chive broke, causing the skip
to drop several feet, but doing no
particular harm. The shafting was
taken to Knight's foundry for repairs.
The men were laid off one shift. Every
thing was . running again' Monday
morning.
South Eureka.— Under the man
agement of J. Truscott, this property
is looking better than it has done for a
longtime. A body of good pay 'rock
has been discovered on the level recent
ly opened, and the 20 stamp mill is to
be started thereon in a few days. The
shareholders are in a more jubilant
spirit. For ten or twelve years the mine
has been worked, costing the stock
holders some hundreds of thousands of
dollars. The prospect is now con
sidered favorable for some return on
their investment.
Boston.— lt is reported that the
Boston mine, which Is located on the
Calaveras side of the Mokelumne river,
opposite the Standard Electric Works,
will be started in the near future. A
strong company is said to be backing
tbe enterprise. Tbe rpek is of low
grade, but there is lots of It. There is
a small mill on the property, and this,
according to rumor, is to be augmented
to 100 stamps. With this crushing
capacity the mine has a good prospect
of becoming a paying venture.
Alma.— We are told that the deeds
for this property have been executed.
There was, and still is, some dispute
affecting a portion of the premises in
cluded within the deed. When the
ground was surveyed it was found that
the bond called for between four and
five acres for which the grantor had no
record title. There is also some con
tention regarding a strip of land front
ing on the north fprk of Jackson creek,
and which was formerly used as a pub
lic road. D. Mattley, the grantor,
obligates himself to furnish a title to
all the laud embraced In the deeds. It
is reported that an effort will be made
soon to float tbe property, and that
foreign capitalists are expected to fur
nish the money needed to further de
velop the ground. According to all
reports, there is a fair prospect of de
veloping a paying mine. It is conceded
to be on the main gold bearing lode.
The regular gouge characteristic of the
lode, was encountered, and some pay
rock struck. It would be in line with
tbe fortune of mining ventures, for the
next company that takes hold to de
velop a big dividend paying property.
Farewell Party.
A farewell surprise party was given
to Miss Annie Drobatz at her home on
the Hamilton addition on Saturday,
April 25, on the eve of her departure
with her parents to San Jose. Those

Vault and Monument.
A. Franatovlch has made a written
contract with Frank Hoffman for the
erection of a vault and tombstone over
the grave of Mrs. Christina Hoffman.
The work will far surpass anything of
the kind in the cemeteries here at
present. Franatovich, our local sculp
tor, Is fully qualified to undertake this
costly piece of workmanship. The
samples of his handicraft which he has
turned out, sufficiently attest his skill
and genius In this particular line. The
material for the column is to be of
Quincy granite, highly polished, and
walks leading to the vault are to be of
Carrara Italian marble. The contract
price for the work Is $1700, everything
complete; $700 already paid on signing
the agreement, and the balance on
completion of the work. The con
tractor will enter upon the work at
once. He calculates that it will take
four months of steady work to com
plete this work.

Obituary.
George Fallen, after a long illness,
Incident to extreme age, died at his
home, near Martell's station, yesterday
morning, May 7. Deceased was born
in Ireland, in 1822, and at the time of
bis death was 81 years and 23 days old.
He came to California in 1860, and
shortly thereafter settled on the home
stead which has been his dwelling place
all the subsequent years. His wife
preceded him to the grave many years
ago. He was of a kindly disposition,
and a man of strict Integrity of char
acter. He leaves a family of four
grown-up children, namely, Thomas
H., Geo. L., and John Henry Fullen,
all residents of Amador county, and a
daughter, Mrs. Robert Robinson, of
Grass Valley, Cal. The remains will
be taken to San Francisco to-morrow,
and the funeral will take place on Mon
day, at Cypress Lawn cemetery, where
his brother John Fullen was burled
several years ago.
Died on the Way Home.
Dr. A. N. Robert, a practicing phy
sician and surgeon of Volcano, died on
his way home from San Francisco last
Tuesday. The deceased went to the
city some two weeks ago for medical
treatment. That he was a very sick
man was known, and to none better
than himself. On the trip by train as
far as Gait there was nothing to indi
cate that the end was near. Between
Gait and lone he seemed in a drowsy
condition, and this did not alarm the
Other passengers. When the train
reached lone it was at once noticed that
he failed to make any effort to leave
his seat. Upon investigation it was
found that he was in a stupor, and un
conscious. He was taken from the
train and placed on a truck, and medi
cal aid summoned. Before a doctor
could reach him he had passed away.
Coroner Huberty was notified, and
held an inquest the same evening. The
jury returned a verdict of death from
heart failure. No autopsy was made;
it was deemed unnecessary. At any
rate, without it the jury seemed to be
able to reach tho above indefinite con
clusion.
The remains were embalmed and
conveyed to Volcano during Tuesday
night, where the funeral will take place
to-day.
Deceased was a bright young man,
and popular with all classes In the
eastern section of tho county, where he
was mostly known. He had been a
practitioner at Volcano for about six
years. He leaves a wife and two chil
dren in Volcano. He was a member of
the Masonic fraternity.

A Fatal Dost.
The two year old daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. V. Pasquetti came to her
death last Thursday under peculiar cir
cumstances. The parents live on Sut
ter hill, near the Vicini hotel. On the
day In question the father had taken
some pills for some ailment. It is sup
posed that the child noticing the father
taking the medicine, and with a pro
pensity for imitation strong in the in
fant mind, got the notion to take some
herself. Accordingly" she swallowed
some of the pills — whether one or more
we have not heard. The precise nature
of the pellets we do not know. The
child was taken violently sick after
partaking thereof. Everything was
done to relieve the sufferings of the
little one, but to no purpose, as she
died in a short time thereafter. The
parents were distracted with grief over
the sad affair, and the sympathy of the
neighborhood was strongly expressed
for them in their distress. The child
was buried Sunday. No inquest was
held.

School Picnic at Plymouth.
Tbe pretty little valley In which the
Slate Creek schoolhouse Is located was
enlivened by the presence of several
hundred people on Saturday, May 2J
The occasion being a picnic under the
auspices of the Slate Creek, Spring
Valley and Willow Springs schools.
The teachers of the respective districts,
Miss Mamie Wheeler, Miss Laura N.
Maybury and Miss Mabel Wheeler,
spared no pains to make the affair a
success, and to say they succeeded is
putting it mild. Nature has been kind
to many portions of Amador county ,*
and particularly so to the country ad
jacent to scenes of Saturday's festivi
ties; thus making it an ideal place to
hold a picnic. The grounds are gener
ously supplied with oak trees, large
and small, the grass fresh and green,
and with the groups of prettily dressed
women and children scattered pro
miscuously about in the full enjoyment
of health and "happiness, could any
thing more beautiful be Imagined?
The day's entertainment began at
10 a. m. with appropriate exercises,
which were held in front of the school
house, the same being . handsomely
decorated with American flags, also
ferns and flowers gathered from the
woods. The following program was
rendered to an appreciative audience,
and lasted until high noon: I
Chorus— "Hail smiling morn, "choir.
Opening address— Jabe Ninnis.
Chorus— "Come away," schools. *
Recitation — "The picket guard, "
Robert Brown.
Duet— "Come merry birds of spring, "
Myrtle Colburn and Celia Nlnnls.
Dialogue— "The 2:40 train," Slate
Creek pupils.
Chorus— "Come rise with the lark,"
Recitation— "Where is my kitty,"
Delia Brown. V
Cornet solo — "Love's dreamland
waltzes, " F. A. Ball.
Recitation— "The Dutchman's first
experience with the. ague," Albert
Grellch.
Chorus T -"Hunter's call," choir. ;
Recitation-" Great men," Elbert
Colburn.
Recitation and song— Mrs. B. iAI
Downey.
Flag drill and chorus— Slate Creek
pupils.
Song— •• America, " schools and
audience.
Word was then passed, "one hour
for lunch," and of all the good .things
to eat none were missing at this time.
If you ever attended a picnic near Ply
mouth town you could realize what
it was; otherwise it is useless to make
you comprehend: It would be an im
possibility.
The feature of the afternoon : was a
baseball game between the Plymouth
and a "pick-up" nine. It was evident
from the start that the '.'pick-ups"
were not In It. Their pitcher couldn't
find "home base," and tally after tally
was made by the other side without as
much as striking at the ball: In the
fourth Inning, however, Love' of Oleta
and Waddell of lone were put In as
catcher and pitcher for the "green
horns." Then things were different,
but It was too late to save the day and
Plymouth won by a score of 22 to 12.
The ball game was witnessed by an
enthusiastic crowd of "spoolers," and
the Plymouth girls can "take the cake"
—how they can 'yell.: A series' of races
and other games bad been arranged
for the afternoon, but were not entered
into owing to the time occupied by the
ball game. Everyone was pleased with
the day's outing, and much credit is
due to the young ladles who planned
the pleasures of the day.

Petition for Opening of a Lane.
The following petition has been filed
with the board of supervisors, and will
be acted upon at next meeting:
Whereas a certain public street or
lane In the townsite of Jackson proper
ly laid down and marked upon the of
ficial map of said townsite and more
particularly described as follows: Be
ginning on the west side of tbe street
or highway known as Sutter road and
running thence southwesterly between
the lots numbered 24 and 31 and thence
southerly between the lots numbered
30 on the west and lots 24, 22, 21, 32,
and 33, on the east in block numbered
10 of said townsite, as shown on the
plat annexed to petition, - Is at certain
points entirely closed, making it im
■ possible for the public to travel said
street or lane, either with vehicles or
on foot. . . ....
Now therefore, we the undersigned
residents of Jackson, respectfully ask
your honorable board to open or cause
street or lane to be opened to Its full
width and length, at as early a date as
practicable. Signed by 16 residents
and property holders.
The street in question runs from a
point on Main street near Lemin 's sa
loon, crossing the north fork of Jackson
creek, and thence on the west bank of
the creek, finally connecting with
Vogan street, running by the west side
of the National hotel. The northern
portion of this alleged public road has
been fenced and closed for many years.
It is expected that the petition for the
removal of the obstructions . will
awaken considerable opposition, and
may possibly lead to a contest In the
courts.

Swunnmlmllum,
Somnambulism? What is it? Did you
ever walk in your sleep? If so, you
know Just about as much about this
strange use of the faculties and senses
of the mind and the body as does the
averago physician. Somnambulism has
been a mystery and a matter of discus
sion to the medical profession since the
days of the ancients. They knew as
well as we all now know that there Is
such a thing as somnambulism or walk
ing in the sleep. They attempted to ex
plain It just as modern medical science
has been endeavoring to explain It ever
since. But as It was then so It Is now.
There are so many explanations that
even the physician Is puzzled to decide
which to accept
Oatrlcb Flumes,
In each wing of an ostrich twenty
slx long white plumes grow to maturi
ty In eight months.. In the male these
are pure white, while those of the fe
male shade to ecru or gray. The short
feathers ore plucked for tips, and each
wing furnishes seventy-flve of these.
The tall feathers are of a deep old
Ivory color, and slxty-flve of these
have a commercial value. In a pluck-
Ing at the Coronada ostrich farm 300
feathers were obtained from one bird.
The female ostrich lays seventy eggs a
year.
Waiting Foi tie Change.
"It was too bad to keep you waiting
bo long for your change," said the smil
ing shopgirl as she counted It out "I
am afraid I have given you a bad quar
ter"—
"Whatl" exclaimed Mr. Tytephist in
alarm.
—"of an hour."
"Oh I" he said, considerably relieved.
—Chicago Tribune.
He Tried Again.
Tess— Oh, yes, I feel pretty sure of
him. I rejected him when he proposed
first because I was positive he'd try
again.
. Jess— And you were right. He did
try again, and I accepted him.—Phila
delphia Press.
IN THE STOKEHOLD.
P*edlns tliw Many Ravrnoua P«jr-
uitrea In an Ocean Liner.
The work of eternally pushing the
olil ship on past the meridians— the
nice iivulnst time and the sun and the
Interest on the money— begins in the
gloomy stokehold. You have heard
that the stokehold is hot, and when
you have clambered into it over dis
orderly piles of still smoking ashes,
steadying yourself by. taking incau
tious hold of burning hand rails, and
Stand for the first time face to face
with the furnaces you feel assured of
the fact.
But, besides being hot, it is the moft
active, interesting part Of the ship. It
is her whole life. You must spend
years studying it before you can stand
there in command of your watch with
your hand on the feed check valves,
your eyes on everything in general, and
keep the steam up where it belongs In
spite of the ravenous engines sucking
it away from you i years before yon
can tell, in one swift glance, wimher
a fireman is burning the greatest possi
ble amount of coal per hour in his fires
with- the least amount of waste.
The problem is this: Under a certain
large quantity of water, which is con
tinually changing, build thirty fires,
and by means of them, notwithstand
ing they must all be continually replen
ished with fresh coal and freed from
ashes, keep it at a perfectly even tern*
peraturo (within a very few degrees),
day and night for an indefinite period.
The game is the more interesting be
cause a ship can never afford to spare
more than just barely enough space
for her propelling machinery; conse
quently everything— engines, boilers,
furnaces— must be worked to the very
limit of its capacity.
The game goes as regularly by turns
and in cycles as progressive whist.
Starting with a few fires first In order,
the doors are opened to admit a few
shovelfuls of coal thrown quickly Into
the front of the furnaces, then closed
again as soon as possible lest too much
cold air should enter. As soon as they
are closed the fires next in order are
served the same way and then a third
group. Next the "green" coal In the
first fires is raked back through the
furnaces to complete its combustion.
After another short interval It is nec
essary to "slice" them— that is, probe
them with long pointed bars to lift the
clinkers from the grates and make air
passages. Finally it is time to stoke
again.— Benjamin Brooks In Scribner's.
How Cnlnese Hatcb Fish.
The Chinese have a method of hatch
ing the spawn of fish and thus protect
ing It from those accidents which gen
erally destroy a large portion of It The
fishermen collect with care from the
margin and surface of water all those
gelatinous masses which contain the
spawn of fish, and after they have
found a sufficient quantity they fill
with it the shell of a fresh hen's egg,
which they have previously emptied,
stop up the bole and put it under a sit
ting fowl. At the expiration of a cer
tain number of days they break the
shell in water warmed by the sun. The
young fry are presently batched and
are kept In pure, fresh water till they
an> large enough to be thrown Into tho
pom] with the old fish. The sale of
spawn for this purpose forms an im
portant branch of trade In China.
A Dnd Country For Ilats.
Hats have a hard time in China. The
climate, alternating from Intense dry
uoss to a horrible humidity, twists and
distorts silk, beaver, cloth and felt In
no time. Mold and fungus are uni
versal and* convert sweatband and
brim into green velvet in a single
night. Every hat must be put out In
the sunlight three times a week or It Is
ruined. Besides these foes are ants
which go everywhere and cockroaches
which fly like birds. The ant enjoys a
good hat for a playground and a sleep
ing establishment; the cockroach de
sires merely to eat every particle of
leather, paper and pasteboard It con
tains. The only way to keep the pests
off is to sprinkle the interior occasion
ally with carbolic add, creosote of
crude cressol.
Unconscious Sarcasm.
"Charley, dear," said young Mrs.
Torkins very seriously, "I have bought
you a little book as a present"
"Very kind of you."
"I hope you won't be offended, but
it Is something that I feel you ought
to read. It Is about betting."
"I don't know that I care for any ser
mons, even if I do lose occasionally."
"It isn't a sermon, Charley, dear. It
is a little book entitled 'Poker and How
to Play It' "—Washington Star.
A Homely Man.
John James Heidegger, manager of
the opera house in the Haymarket, in
Ldhdon, in tho times when George was
king, one day laid a wager with the
Earl of Chesterfield that he would not
find In all London an uglier face than
his. After a long search the earl pro
duced a woman of St Giles who at first
seemed to outvie the manager, but
when the latter put on the woman's
cap he was allowed to retain the palm
of ugliness.

SUDDEN DEATH.
It I« Uanallr the Remit of ton* !»•«•
lect to Exercise.
In almost every dally paper are to be
Been several announcements that some
body has died suddenly. These sudden
deaths are more liable to be men than
women. Mr. So-and-so fell dead on the
Btreet or In his office while writing let
ters or preparing a sermon or doing
something or other. "Pound Dead In
His. Boom" is becoming a very com
mon headline. These deaths are hard
ly ever accounted for. Generally some
thing is said about the heart — some
vague insinuation that the heart was
not acting in a proper manner — but, as
a rule, no explanation which Is really
rational is furnished.
It is a well known fact that the heart
Is a muscle. If the muscles of the body
are allowed to become flabby, the heart
also becomes flabby. A flabby heart
may be trusted to pump the blood
through the system ordinarily, but a
sudden fright or 'emergency, A sudden
expenditure of energy, as in running
up steps or any other unusual exercise,
Is liable to overpower the heart. It
suddenly stops, and the man falls dead.
. Tobacco tends to produce a flabby
heart; whisky tends to produce en
largement of the heart; lazy, Indolent
habits weaken the heart and thin the
ventricles. That man who Indites edi
torials, dictates letters, but takes no
muscular exercise, is in danger of fall
ing dead. The life insurance man bet
ter steer clear of him. It is of vastly
more importance to know what his hab
its are with reference to physical exer
cise than to know whether his grand
mother died of heart . disease or his
grandfather had rheumatism. The doc
tor might a great deal better Interview
his wife and discover how the man be
haves himself than to examine the
blood for microbes or the urine for
urate crystals.
If a man must be strenuous, let him
be strenuous all round. He should take
a little strenuous physical exercise ev
ery day as well as strenuous mental
work. It Is even dangerous to neglect
to take dally physical exercise. Fatty
degeneration is killing more men today
than is smallpox.— Medical Talk.
MU3INQB.
Wit that wounds Is the cruel surgerj
of speech.
Heaven help the man whose friends
are all enemies.
If you must refuse a favor, learn the
art of being polite about it
The money that makes one mare go
often makes the other mare stop.
You have not lost your fortune as
long as you have not lost your life.
Make chums of your wife and chil
dren and know the whole charm of

There Is no such thing as ease within
the belief of men and women whose
hearts are unselfish.
Men of small minds are slow to see
In any man more than they are capable
of seeing In themselves.
You can bet your boots, my boy, your
boss knows what you are about You
don't fool him; yon fool yourself.
To be Important Is one thing; to look
Important is another thing, but to feel
Important, there you have the fellow
who really enjoys his own society.—
Schoolmaster.
Finnish Grammar.
Finnish grammar Is of a difficulty
absolutely repulsive. None of the oth
er languages of the same group Is half
so hard. Hungarian— nay, even Turk
ish, despite the vexatious Initial Im
pediment of the Arabic alphabet— is
easy in comparison. The syntax is at
once provoklngly, elaborate and -per
plex ingly obscure. It possesses fifteen
distinct cases and four and twenty
differentiated Infinitive forms; but on
the other hand, there Is no real dis
tinction between nouns, adjectives, ad
verbs, prepositions, Infinitives and'par
ticiples, so that the student must not
be startled by finding Infinitives regu
larly declined like nouns, and nouns
taking upon them degrees of compari
son like adjectives.
Spaniels.
Spaniels, of which there are many
breeds, aro supposed to have first come
from Spain, from which circumstance
is derived their distinctive name.
Charles I. was an ardent admirer of a
small variety of this animal, and from
that arose the designation of his pets,
known the world over as King Charles.
Blenheim or Marlborougb. spaniels,
which greatly resemble the latter In
form and general appearance, get their
English name from Blenheim palace
In Oxfordshire, where tho breed has
been preserved since the beginning of
the eighteenth century.
Stamina Needed.
The one Indispensable qualify of suc
cess in thoso days of tremendous com
petition Is stamina. The young man
who lacks that will never get far. He
will soon be forced out of the race and
sidetracked. Those who have possess
ed it have conquered Innumerable dif
ficulties.—Success.

Settling; a Hotel Bill la Portugal.
In Portugal when the traveler asks
for his Mil the landlord pleasantly rubs
his bauds together and answers,
"Whatever your excellency pleases to
give."
This will not do, for the traveler Is
sure to offer too little or too much and
to be thought either a spendthrift or a
niggard, so he has to make a speech,
thank the landlord for his confidence
and beg for a detailed statement
Then the landlord, politely deprecat
ing anything of the kind, is slowly per
suaded to check off the various items
upon the fingers of his hand, with a
long argument before each successive
finger Is done with and doubled down.
"What does it come tor asks the
traveler, taking out his purse at last,
when the hand and the account are
closed. : .
"What, did his .excellency not add
upr
His excellency having been Incapable
of this act of mental arithmetic, the
addition is gone over again, from the
little finger, backward, with a finger or
two perhaps representing forgotten
items brought into account from the
other hand.
The sum total Is gladly paid, and host
and guest are mutually content, the
guest knowing that he has not been
overcharged more than perhaps a
thumb and two fingers.
Ancient Needlework.
Some of the oldest needlework extant
was found in Egyptian dnd Egypto-
Roman tombs— a rough sort of flaxen
cloth, like the bath toweling of our
own day. It has loops of wool worked
with some kind of needle, raised on
one side of the stuff only, and a kind
of tapestry partly woven and partly
outlined In needlework. The mummies
which -an insatiable modern curiosity
has disturbed are wrapped In linen, as
less liable than woolen doth to the
ravages of moth, and the art of weav
ing the flax that grew so plentifully on
the banks of the Nile was ' probably
learned by the Israelites during their
sojourn in Egypt
Ezeklel speaks of "fine linen with
bro'dered work from Egypt" Linen
seems the natural ground and founda
tion of all embroidery. It often lasts
longer than the work Itself, can be
cleaned and will not fray or wear out,
as do more costly silks and satins.—
London Spectator.
Small Bits of Gold.
Gold Is so very tenacious that a piece
of it drawn Into wire one-twentieth of
an Inch in diameter will sustain a
weight of 500 pounds without break
ing. Its malleability Is so great that
a single grain may be divided Into
2,000,000 parts and a cubic Inch Into
0,523,809,529 parts, each of which may
be distinctly seen by the naked eye.
The Fun of It.

"Is It proper to kiss a young lady to

The Peacock on a Rainy Day.
The peacock, glittering with jewel
like eyes, has a voice by no means suit
ed to Its beauty. Its cry Is harsh and
disagreeable. When the rain falls. It
alts on some high perch uttering its
doleful sounds, with Its beautiful tall
feathers drawn Into the smallest possl
Die space. Like a vain creature as it
lit, it never spreads its fan unless the
Sunshines. -.'■;.'

What Be Did.
"What did that man do to make him
self so famous?" asked the inquirer,
gazing curiously at an individual who
formed the central of a social group.
"To the best of my knowledge," re
plied the cynic, "he did the public."
Never argue at the dinner table, for
the one who is not hungry always gets

"Wine of Cardut is indeed a blessing
to tired women. Having suffered for
seven years with weakness and bear-
ing-down pains, and having tried sev-
eral doctor/ and different remedies
with no success, your Wine of Cardui
was the only thing which helped me,
and eventually cured me It seemed to
build up the weak parts, strengthen
the system and correct irregularities."

means nervous women who have
disordered menses, falling of the
womb, ovarian troubles or any of
these ailments that women have.
