A PRINCE OF PRODIGALS
FORMER HOSTLER BECOMES A
CALIFORNIA MILLIONAIRE
And Spends Vast Sums in Open-hearted
Manner — Loyal to Old Friends and;
Generous to Anyone Who
. Struck His Fancy.
[ Saturday Globe, Utlco, N. V., Feb. 13, 1901. ]
One of the most prodigal of million
aires who ever surprised a section of
the country by the liberality of his
spending* was James M. Dunn, who
recently died in Paris Dunn was the
sod of a laborer and was born at James
town, N.-Y. As a boy ha worked as
a hostler and then drifted westward,
working: in various menial capacities
in Cleveland, St. Louis and Kansas
City. Twenty years ago he reached 1
the t-olil mining camps of Calaveras
anfl Nevada . counties, Cal.- For 12
years he lived the life of a desert pros
pector— a$ hard a life as any American
citizen knows nowadays. During: a few
months in each year be would work in
the bowels of a Calaveras county mine,
while he saved every dime possible
toward another season of prospecting
among the Cocopah mountains, or .the
desolate couutry in the region of Death
Valley, or across the Mojave Desert.
At length he located the golden ledge
of the Big Jennie mine in -A mad or
county and soon became a millionaire
several times over. He had an income
at times as high as $13,000 a month
from the property. With the beginning
of the development of' his gold discov
eries at what is now known as the min
ing camp of Dunnville, Dunn announced
that his work was over. /' Henceforth."
he said. "I'll have a gay time and when
I'm dead I'll be tenderly remembered
by some people, anyhow."
SPENDS MONEY LIKE WATE^R.
He held to thisfpolicy. When he had
bought a house for his aged mother
near Golden Gate Park, in San Fran
cisco, and had settled a certain share
of the Big Jennie dividends upon her,
he went abroad seeking pleasure. He
gave $2000 to a sickly old printer who
had been friendly to him in his days of
poverty. He sent $1,500 at Christmas,
1897, to the widow of a printer in New
York who had given him a home for a
few weeks years before, and he sent
$500 to pay a $75 bill contracted in
Brooklyn years previously.
Two years ago he took a fancy to a
mixed drink that a Los Angoles bar
tender concocted. He was going to
visit the City of Mexico, and he asked
the bartender to mix several quart bot
tles of the drink for him to take along
on his trip. When the bartender re
plied that tho stuff wouldn't stand bot
tlinir longer than a few hours, Dunn in
aisled thaj, the bartender and his wife
should go along pn the tqur at his ex
pense. Tho trio wore gone two months,
and all the bartender had to do was to
mix drinks for Dunn.
At another timo when Dunn was get
ting shaved in Los Angeles he remark
ed that bo was about . to go to New
York on a pleasure trip.
"What wouldn't I give to go like
that, with never a care on my mind!"
said the barber.
"Ever been to New York?" asked
Dunn.
"No, and I probably never shall go."
"Well, now, I'm looking around' for
another fel'.ow to fill out our party, "
said Dunn, "and you corao right along
this afternoon. I've got three other
men who have never boon east, and
we'll all haye a big time together.
What's more, it won't cost you a cent
all the time you're gone from tho shop. ','
That pleasure trip cost Dunn $6,000,
and be always said that it was the best
time of his life. He had a tender spot
in his heart for streot urchins, because
he had been one himself. He never
went to San Francisco or to any other
eastprn city without attracting atten
tion by the showers o f money be scat
tered among the street children about
the hotels whore he stopped. Once he
tossed $500 in silver coin out of a sec
ond story window of the Palace Hotel
in San Francisco. He used to leave $20
gold pieces among the rumpled clothes
on his bed, and when the coin was ro
turned to him by an hqnest chamber
maid he would give it back with one or
two tnoro of the same value.
LOYAL TO HIS OLD FRIENDS.
He was visiting the jail in Portland
Ore, a year ago when he saw confined
there a mq,n whqin he once knew as a
brother prospector in Arizona. The
man was awaiting trial for forgery.
Dunn hired a lawyer to defend the
prisoner and at an expense of hundreds
of dollars got the man acquitted. .
Last suQituei', while at Santa
Cataliua. lsland, he conceived a fancy
for a Mexican boatman who took him
out fishing, and one day he surprised
the poor fellow by the gift of a $2,300
houso.
A class of girls in a private gptpinary
at San Francisco permitted him to so?
loct tho class motto for them, and when
the graduating exercises were over he
hired a Pullman car and sent the whole
class with two teachers'* as chaperons
on a 30-day tour of the Pacific coast
and to tl}o Ye!?o w §tpne Park.
He once heard a young woman sing
in an opera iv Chicago, and when he
learned that she was supporting herin

valid mother and sister he paid the op
eratic manager to release her from her
contract and sent all three to California
for six months at his expense. For a
veteran prospector, who broke down
from hardship and exposure, he bought
a home, and then fitted out the old fel
low's two sons for a prospecting trip to
the Klondike.
During the summer of 1898 he wont
abroad with five men from Arizona and
California who had been his friends in
the days of want, and he let none of
the party take a cvnl along. A mother
in Dunnville who named tier baby for
him found a sack of 100 $20 gold pieces
on the door step one day. He once
gave every woman in a dance hall at
BakersQeld $300 to go home and lead a
better life, but the local preacher who
spoke of tho act in church on tho follow
ing Sunday he never forgave. Two
Christmases ago he sent anonymously
$50 in money to a'dozen or two veter
ans of tho Soldiers' Home at Santa
Monica.
When the smallpox broke out in the
gold camps in Amadur county two win
ters ago and two men finally volun
teered to nurse the sick in the pest
bouse, he bought each of them a cot
tage home, and he had the houses fur
nished completely, ivady for the men
and their families to move into when
the epidemic was over. Last Novem
ber he secretly sent 10 lons of haras and
many bushels of corn to a friendly and
noglectod tribe of Indians, the Pimas,
whom he heard were starving because
of drought on their reservation in
southern Arizona.
It now turns out that the manager
of the consumptives' hospital at Phoe
nix, Ariz., has been receiving periodical
gifts of $1,500 and $3,000 from James
Dunn because an old mining chum of
Dunn's was taken in there and cared
for when there was no possible chance
of pecuniary reward for th" service.
HAD NO USE FOB FRILLS.
Meanwhile Dunn lived like a prince.
He eschewed fashionable clothing and
such frills v* a valet, and lackeys to do
his bidding, but he spent thousands of
dollars in high living. He delighted in
having diamonds of the clearest hue
and as big as filberts in the front of a
cheap calico shirt. With his blazing
diamond studs and cuS buttons, worth
from $5,000 to $6,000. his corduroy
clothes, red and white calico shins,
great russet leather boot*, with trou
sers tucked in them, anil with a mam
moth sombrero 011 bis hc;id, Dunn was
a conspicuous figure in San Francisco
and Los Angeles. He gave one of his
diamonds to v waller in a St. Louis
hotel once because the waiter . had
pleased him by some simple service.
When Dunn traveled he went in style.
He frequently hired a whole Pullman
car for himself and some mining camp
friends on a trip across tho continent.
He usually gave some caterer carte
blanche orders to stock the car with all
the best eatables ;unl drinkables that
money could buy.
A few months ago Dunn, with sev
eral companions, went to Europe and a
short time ago word was received of his
death in a Paris hospital. He made a
will the day before his death, leaving
his mining stock and real estate to two
brothers, ' who woro his friends and
helpers 17 years ago, when James
Dunn's capital consisted of a shovel, a
pickax and a rude board shanty in a
Calaveras county camp.

BAD HABITS.
The -Woman 'Who Didn't Want Them
In Herself or Others.
! Mrs. Jennings looked through her
glnssea at her sister, Miss Sprawle,'
with considerable severity. "This
neighborhood has got into strange
ways the last few years, or else I no-*
tlce it more as I get further along,"
she snid, "and lest I should get into
Bio same way I want you to remind
nic now and then. Mary.
i "If you find me backbiting like that
fateful, stingy Annabel Powder or
tucy White, that had better look to
Ber own saucy, bad mannered girl, and
Der boy, that's the poorest scholar in
Ko. 1, or if you catch ■me growing
close fisted like the minister's wife,
that hns never returned the' cupful of
granulated sugar she borrowed that
time the delegates came, or long wind
ed ■ like Jane Larkin, who Interrupted
me in the very midst of my telling her
fcjjout Sally's twins and went on about
her spindling grandson for most fif
teen minutes without stopping, I want
you should tell me frankly. ST ."
"And that's not all," said Mrs. Jen
nings as Miss Sprawle opened her
mouth to speak. "If you find me get
ting Inquisitive like Helen Lane, that's
asked me three times when my birth
day comes and what year I was born
after my having to go to the town
records to find out her age, I want you
to mention it freely, and I shall do the
same by you.
"If folks don't help each other,
what's the good of being set In fam
ilies? You've got a little habit of in
terrupting, Mary, that's growing on
you, and I'm going to do what I can
to help you break it up."— Youth's

A TOUCH OF NATURE.
Pathetic Story of a Mother of the
Labrador Coast,
Writing of the people of the Labra
dor coast, in Harper's Magazine, Nor
man Duncan tells a pathetic story of
a poor mother whom he met sitting
with her child outside the Battle Har
bor hospital: /; >'
"'He've always been like that,' she
said. 'He's wonderful sick. I've fetch
ed un out here t' get the air. He doos
better In the air, zur,' she added;
'much, much better.'
"•He'll be getting better,' said I.
•Here in the hos'—
" 'He'll die,' she interrupted quickly.
"I was glad that he was to die. It
would be better for him and for her.
She would forget his deformity; she
would forever have the memory of
him lying warm upon her breast,
warm and lovely; for, in. this, memory
is kind to womeq,
" 'You have—another? 1
" 'No, zur;. 'tis me first'
•The child stirred and complained.'
She lifted him from her lap, rocked
him, hushed him, drew him close,
rocking him all the time.
" 'And does he talk? I asked.
"She looked up in a glow of pride
and answered me, flushing gloriously,
while she turned her shining eyes once
more upon the gasping babe upon her
breast:'
" 'He said "mamma," once!'
"And so the Labrador 'llveyere* Is
kin with the whole wide world."
Women and the Theater.
Avowedly women are both directly
and indirectly the beat friends of the
theatrical manager. If he can please
the feminine portion of his audience
he is tolerably sure of success, for
when a woman likes a play she Induces
her men folk to go to U. This being
so, ought not women to be specially
considered in all places of entertain
ment? But it is precisely on the oppo
site lines that the manager commonly
proceeds. Men are encouraged to push
and squeeze past and disturb and in
convenience ladles between the acts
because smoking rooms are provided
for them In motf thpaterg. Women, on
the other band, are expostulated with
and denounced if. they wear hats at a
matinee.— London World.
Newton's Accuracy.
Newton's law of gravitation, which
states that two bodies attract each oth
er with a force Inversely proportional
to the square of the distance between
them, was made the subject of an ex
haustive. Investigation by Professor
Brown of Havorford college. His cal
culations show Newton's laws to repre
sent the motion of our moon to within
the one-millionth part of 1 per cent,
and he states that no other physical
law has ever been expressed wlth'any
thlng like the precision of the simple
statement of this one.— London Globe.
Punishment by Proxy. .
A mother recently brought her little
boy to school for his first time, and
she said to the teacher:
j "This little boy is very delicate, as he
is afther a fit of harmonya on the
loongs, but if he does anything bould,
and I kngw he. "will, bate the wan next

"Here is a new pupil," said the boy's

The Nerre Actions Superinduced by
Cold, Fear and Anger.
Cold, ,by stimulating the sensory
nerve endings in the skin; produces a
corresponding irritation in the brain
motor centers and by contracting the
blood vessels in the skin produces a
temporary excess of blood In the brain.
This interferes with the steady flow of
nerve force to the muscles, so that the
spasmodic action of these nerve cur
rents produces the trembling due to
cold. - ~ '"
Of trembling from fear or anger Dar
win gives this explanation: "Men dur
ing long generations have endeavored
to escape from their enemies by flight
or violent struggling. These cause
breathlessness and trembling of the
muscles. Whenever fear is felt the
same results tend to appear through
the force of inheritance and association.
Just as furious rage leads persons to
make violent attacks on the object of
their resentment so in milder cases,
though no such attack may be made,
the beginning of violent exertion —
namely, trembling of the muscles
tends to show Itself, But the chlei
cause of trembling from fear or anger
Is, according to the same authority,
the interruption or disturbance of the
transmission of nerve force from the
cerebro spinal system, due to mental
agitation. Why or how these emotions
affect the cerebro spinal system
through the mind In this way is not
known," :V;\
The Flrat Use of Hnpklns.
A French writer who evidently was
conservative and did not welcome the
napkin kindly records with scorn:
"The napkin Is placed- under the
chin and fastened in the back, as If
one were going to be shaved. A person
told me that he wore his that way
that he might not soil his. beautiful
frills."
1% Was difficult matter to tie the
two corners in the back, and It is said
that thence originated our expression
for straitened circumstances, "hard to
make both ends meet." This custom
led to the habit of the table waiters "of
carrying a napkin on the left arm.
Barbarous Treatment of Iho Women.
The Ibos have a barbarous custom of
destroying twins. A woman who gives
birth to twins is regarded as some
thing accursed, and the children arc
taken from her and thrown into the
bush to perish, while she is proclaim
ed nn outcast and driven from the vil
lage. To hold up two fingers to nn
{bo woman is to offer her the greatest
insult* possible. They are very super
stitious. They worship idols of wood,
mud and Iron, which are regarded as
protectors to be propitiated at various
periods, and slavery exists among all
the tribes.
Wfrnt I'Chnrm" RenUr Means.
The -word "charm" is from the Latin
"carmen." Originally it meant Incan
tation. To charm a person is to be
witch Dim. In "Julius Cffisar," act HI..
scene 1, "I charm you," seems to mean
"I adjure you." When we speak now
of a charming woman we do not Im
ply that she sings an incantation to
us, but there is a pretty figure of
speech in our use of the word. We
mean that she has the same command
over us as it the incantation were sung
and we were bewitched.

GOT AS GOOD AS HE GAVE.
How Philanthropist Corcoran 'Was
Answered by a Woman.
The late W. W. Corcoran, the million
aire philanthropist of Washington,
who gave -to the city the magnificent
art gallery which bears his name, was
very fond of telling how he was once
overmatched by a wealthy maiden la
dy from whom he desired to purchase
a piece of property.
• Mr. Corcoran was the owner of the
Arlington hotel, at the corner of Ver
mont avenue and H street Adjoining
the hotel property on the H street side
was & handsome brownstone mansion,
owned by the maiden lady. The lot
upon which the house was built ex
tended back to I street, a distance of
four hundred feet, and abutted on the
rear of the hotel property.
Mr. Corcoran found it necessary, to
enlarge the hotel property and with
this end In view desired to purchase
the rear end of the lot owned by. the
maiden lady. As she was Very
wealthy, he knew that a large price
would not be any special inducement
and for a time was at a loss to know
exactly how to approach her. He finals
ly concluded to go straight to the point,
and therefore addressed her the fol
lowing note:
Dear Miss C— How much will you taka
for your back yard? We wish to enlarge
the Arlington hotel. Tours sincerely.

Promptly came the reply:
Dear Mr. Corcoran—How much will you
take for the Arlington hotel? We wish to
enlarge our back yard. Tours cordially,

The beat disinfectant of all Is sunlight.
It destroy* by its very brightness all sorts
of germs and at the same time helps the
growth of plants and animal life. Doubt-

Bright sunlight quickly destroys germs,

is best to let the sunlight into your houses

At the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Insti-
tute, Buffalo, N. V., Dr. Pierce, chief con-
sulting surgeon, started experiments, some
three years ago, with the Finsen light in
conjunction with the X-ray in the treat-
ment of diseases. He got excellent results
therefrom, and was among the first to adapt
this remarkable cure to many cases which
it was formerly supposed must of necessity
be treated by the knife. ■■■-; •-.•.
Not only is Dr. R. V. Pierce notable for
his surgical achievements at his hospital in
Buffalo, but nearly a third of a century ago
he discovered certain roots and herbs
which were nature's remedies, and suc-
ceeded in putting them up in a form that
would be easily procured and ready to use.
This he called Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery, It maintains the patient's nu-
trition by enabling him to eat, retain, digest
and assimilate nutritious food. It over-
comes gastric irritability and symptoms of
indigestion, and in this way fever, night-
sweatSj headaches, etc., are done away with.
It fortifies the body against the germs of
consumption, grip and malaria, it builds
up the tissues and puts on healthy fk.-h.

FRIDAY. MAY 20, 1904
INSTRUCTED FOR HEARST.
The action of the democratic state
convention in instructing the Cali
fornia delegation to the national
convention to support Hearst for the
presidential nomination, has very
materially enhanced the outlook of
the millionaire newspaper owner for
carrying off the honor of being se
lected as the standard-bearer at St.
Louis. Without the backing of the
party's representatives from his own
state, his candidacy would have been
hopelessly crippled. That the in
struction program was pressed to
final victory in the face of bitter op
position—even in . presence of a
severe repulse of his cohorts on pre
liminary organization — if anything
adds to, rather than detracts from,
the significance of the victory. The
adverse verdict on the chairmanship
revealed to his managers where
their line might be strengthened,
and that they were able to bring
over enough recruits to their side
before the decisive vote was taken
to change seeming defeat to victory,
shows a thorough mastery of the
situation, and a reserve force in the
background equal to the occasion.
That Hearst is unpopular with the
leaders as well as the rank and file
of democracy is evident. Democrats
in every partof the state disown him
as a true exponent of the party.
Usually a possible candidate for
president is readily accorded the
unanimous support of his own state.
Hearst had to fight, and fight hard,
to get this start on the road to the
nomination. But be has reached the
goal of his ambition as far as Cali
fornia is concerned. The fight has
been transferred to St. Louis. He
is not one whit more popular in the
nation than in California. Apart
from his money bags he would not
be thought of as available material.
That adroit political managers are
in charge of his campaign there is
no question. It remains to be seen
whether the tactics successful at
Santa Cruz will not be equally po
tent in the larger arena at St.
Louis. \ln spite of the bitter per
sonal antagonism, Hearst seems to
be the most talked-of candidate in
the democratic coop, while his chief
competitor, Parker of New York, is
losing ground daily.
The republican state convention
in Sacramento this week was har
"monious throughout. It was a per
functory affair. There was no conten
tion as to the choice for president,
and the delegates assembled to ratify
the wish of the party for the nomina
tion of Theodore Roosevelt for pres
ident. Amador county expected to
get one of the delegates from the
first congressional district in the
person of E. C. Voorheis of Sutter
Creek. Before the convention as
sembled it was generally conceded
that he would be selected as the rep
resentative from the mining section.
An unwise and ill-timed effort was
made in a neighboring county io ig
nore Humboldt, aud monopolize the
delegation for the mining counties.
It was intended principally to help
the Amador candidate. No doubt
Mr. Voorheis was the first choice of
Calaveras as well as Amador. When
the convention assembled, J. C. Bull
of Humboldt and C. Clinch of Nevada
were elected without a contest.

UNIONISM.
In union there is strength, and
strength portrays endurance, but when
strength is wrongly applied a little
skill or tact may overcome it. From
time immemorial men have united their
forces— skill and capital— for mutual
protection, for the advancement of
science and art, and for the fostering
of enterprises that could not have
otherwise been carried out. This has
been the principal means of placing the
United States in the forefront of civi
lized nations. It has been the means
of elevating labor, of increasing capital,
of educating the masses and placing
the children of the poorest beggar on
our streets upon a level with those of
the millionaire who occupies a princely
palace. We are in favor of unionism
in its broadest sense; much good has
come from it io the past, and the pres
ent is full of opportunities that will re
quire combinations of all the resources
of mankind to carry out.
Less than two years ago Amador
county seemed to be enjoying her full
est measure of quiet and prosperity.
Her mines were running unceasingly,
some yielding a fair return for money
expended, others drawing from the
stockholders each month a sufficient
amount with which to keep them in
operation, but all working steadily and
contentedly. Wood and timber men
felt secure in cutting their supplies in
advance, thus allowing them to season
before time for delivery, enabling them
to handle larger and more profitable
loads. At the same time new capital
was coming in, and new prospects were
being operated.
But certainty has changed to uncer
tainty. A paid agitator came, and by
his barks and growls induced tbeu to
band themselves together under the
head of labor union; sowed the seed
of discontent, and managed to desert
the field before the hardest time. But
agitators are like mush rooms — they
spring up iv a night-rand instead of
one we now have many, 'some paid, some
hoping to be paid in the future.
When a boy gets his first pair of
boots he must wade through the same
stream, or a deeper one, than that
through which he has often heard his
father tell about wading. Just so with
these union men. They have heard
about strikes, and the first thing to be
considered was a strike. It came, and
hundreds of men laid down their picks,
shovels and drills, and walked the
streets demanding what should be done
and commanding what should not be
done, and all the time, perhaps un
consciously, losing the respect and con
fidence of employers whose interests
they were jeopardizing. It is said that
at the Kennedy and other mines men
who had held their positions for years,
and reared their families on their hard
earned salaries, shed tears when they
were compelled to quit their work.
Why should they not weep? They had
sacrificed their American manhood;
they were no longer free men. They
must now yield to the nod and beck of
scheming agitators, some of whom
perhaps never did a day's work, al
though they had drawn many a day's
pay.
Yes, the union, like other benevolent
societies, is a benefit, so long as it keeps
within bounds, but when it oversteps
its bounds it becomes a menace to every
industry in the community wherein it
exists. So long as it protects and de
fends, so long as it renders proper as
sistance to its members in seeking em
ployment, so long as it assists its needy
members, so long as it looks after the
widows and orphans of deceased mem
bers, so long as it teaches the principle
of live and let live, just so long will it
be a power in the land, and no longer.
If on the other hand it becomes a
dictator, a usurper of power that be
longs to others; if it assumes to say
that its members shall do all the work
to be had and that outsiders must
starve, and at the same time be the
sole judge as to who shall become Its
members, it then places itself in the
position of the strong against the weak
— the very thing which the organiza
tion pretends to overcome. No one
will deny the right of any person to
better his condition whenever oppor
tunity offers, but every reasonable per
son must concede the right of another
to take a position made vacant by one
who has voluntarily surrendered it.
Quit if you are dissatisfied with your
place; secure a better one If you can, It
is your undeniable privilege to do so.
but do not try to destroy an industry
that may be the means of hundreds of
families gaining a livelihood for years.
- At the Fremont mine for instance,
thousands of dollars have been expend
ed In this enterprise, and before it is
put on a paying basis the men walk out
on account of a trivial matter that
could in no way concern the manage
ment. The mine is now closed on ac
count of the union assuming tho role of
dictator. If those who put money Into
a concern cannot say how and by whom
It shall be worked, then things have
come to an intolerable pass, and nothing
remains to be done except to appeal to
a power more potent than union edicts —
a power that will see that equal justice
Is done to all.

DRYTOWN.
Drytown, May 10.
- I will endeavor once more to send a
few items, to convince the readers of
the Ledger that Drytown is still on the
map and a few of the old residenters
still among us.
Most of the strangers who attended
the grand opening ball given by Frank
Gazzera on last. Saturday night were
surely convinced that there are more
pretty girls and good dancers in Dry
town than in any town in the golden
west. The occasion was gotten up for
the purpose of dedicating the new hall
and christening the new floor, which
was considered by all present the best
dance floor in the county. It was made
of ]Jx3 Oregon pine, and almost as
smooth as glass. The butcher boy, the
foreman of the Pocahontas mine, and
"Shorty" Bicknell measured their full
length, breadth and thickness on the
floor without even breaking their backs.
By ten o'clock in the evening more
than forty ladles were present; among
them were noticed many from Sutter
Creek, Amador, lone and Plymouth.
At midnight all repaired to the ban
quet hall, where a splendid chicken and
raviola supper was served, which all
seemed to enjoy. The music given by
Grainger's full orchestra was first class.
Frank Gazzera is deserving of much
credit for the real enterprise that he
has displayed in investing such an
amount of money in this place. ■ He
surely has a pointer that Drytown is
going to boom in the near future, or as
soon as the strike is declared off.
Many of our citizens who went to the
Fremont and Gover mines this morn
ing with the intention of going to work
were ordered by the union committees
to return home, and go to work in the
hay fields.
Nearly all the ranchers started to cut
their grass hay this morning. In some
fields it is already raked and ready to
haul in.
Last Sunday Hix visited Chas. Cramer
who has been dangerously sick, and
found him able to be out attending to
light chores about the ranch. He has
been under the care of Dr. Tiffany. We
next visited the Comstock ranch and
Tallac Creamery, where they are at
present milking about 90 cows and
making about four dozen rolls tof
delicious butter daily, under the man
agement of Thos. Allen of Forest Home.
At the adjoining ranch Alex Orr lost
a valuable horse during the afternoon.
He was trying to catch her in the
corral, when she reared up on the
picket gate, which nearly disemboweled
her, and she died in a few minutes.
At the Barney, Llttlefield, Huot and
Mathis ranches, they were preparing
to start mowing their grass hay the
following day.
Frank Catto and wife have resigned
their positions at the Barney ranch,
and are now engaged at the Tallac
Creamery.
Miss Edna McWayne closed a very
successful term at the Willow Spring
school on Friday last.
The Drytown school, under the able
management of Miss Mamie Wheeler,
closed on the 2!) th ult.
W. O. Clark lost a valuable milch
cow by clover bloat, and many others
about town were similarly afflicted, but
Dr. Le Mom was called in time to save
them.
Fred Le Mom has just received a lot
of buggies which he is offering for sale
at city prices, with freight added, and
offers to deliver them to any part of
the county.
Several visitors from Henry Clay
Lodge F. and A. M., of Sutter Creek,
attended Drytown lodge at their last
regular meeting, to assist in raising
James H. Moore of Shenandoah valloy.
to the sublime degree of Master Mason!
One day last week an Arabian notion
peddler, (also nuisance peddler) while
making his regular trip about town,
endeavored to play the genuine Hobson
kissing act with a married woman, not
knowing that her husband was on the
night shift, and at that time sleeping
in an adjoining room, who on hearing
the cry of his wife suddenly appeared
on the scene. (Scene 2) In the next
scene Mr. Arab was seen running down
through Main street hatless, and with
a nice big pair of black eyes and blood
streaming from his nose and mouth and
looking as though he had been partly
through a threshing machine. Scene
3— No arrests necessary.
On Tuesday afternoon Fred Le Mom
met with a very painful accident while
engaged in welding some heavy steel
tires. A large scale of hot borax flew
into his blind eye, badly burning the
lower eyelid. Although very painful
nothing serious is apt to result.
Nochio Acuneo, who has been sick
with quick consumption for about three
months, died this afternoon. He was
a brother of Mano Acuneo, who was
killed in the Keystone mine on the
22d of last March. The deceased was
born near Drytown 21 years ago. He
leaves a mother, father, and three
brothers to mourn his loss. Hix.

50th Anniversary.
The V«lcano Masonic Lodge approp
riately celebrated their 50th anni
versary on Tuesday, May 17th, by
giving a day picnic for the children
and an evening entertainment and ban
quet for Masons, their wives, and in
vited guests. While the crowd wan
not too large, enough were present to
make the occasion an enjoyable one.
Everything had been done by tho com
mittee that could reasonably be done
in the way of providing refreshments
and amusements, and everything was
carried out without a hitch to mar the
day's pleasure. What pleased the little
ones and surprised the older ones
mostly, was the fact that everything
was free. Ice cream lemonade, soda
water and lunch in abundance, and not
one cent to pay. The amusements con
sisted of baseball, diving s for oranges,
egg races, etc. The orange contest
was very amusing. A tub was partly
filled with water; five oranges placed
in the tub. and five boys knelt beside
it with their hands firmly tied behind
them. The one that could take an
orange in his teeth, carry it outside
and devour it first, was to receive a
handsome watch, and the second a tie.
Evart Gritton of Volcano won first
prize, and Bertie Zumalt of Pine Grove
second. In the egg race Miss Addle
Miller of Volcano won first prize, and
I Miss Eva Leaks of Jackson second.
The games through with, epeech
making was announced, and Dr. Frei
man, chairman of the committee of
arrangements, introduced Michael
Übbins, who in behalf of the fraternity
extended a welcome to all, and Invited
them to be present at ths ball in the
evening.
_ Attorney Robert Bole was then in
troduced as orator of the day. ' Mr.
Bole was at his best, and in a pleasing
but thrilling manner proceeded •to
point out the many advantages one en
joys by being a Mason. Mr. Bole was
followed by the Rev. F. A. Morrow of
Jackson, who spoko with ease and
fluency, pleasing old and young alike.
H. G. Murray then introduced the
phonograph, playing selections that
captivated all. ';■'■ ''•■-
In the evening, at Masonic hall, the
following program was rendered, inter

FELL DOWN THE SHAFT
Chas. F. Goss Meets Death in the Argo-
naut by Falling 260 Feet.
The Argonaut mine through its
whole history has been remarkably free
from casualties of a fatal character.
On Tuesday morning the second fatal
accident occurred since the present
company started work, the victim being
Chas. F. Goss, a man well known in
this vicinity. Exactly how the mishap
occurred is not known, as there was no
eye witness to tell the story. It oc
curred at the change of shift— 7 o'clock
in the morning. Goss, Michel Banso
vich, and another were working in the
south compartment at the 1690 level.
They were easing the shaft timbers —
that is loosening the ground back of
the timbers so as to relieve the pressure.
The skip or tank travels in the center
compartment', so men employed in the
south compartment are in no danger
whatever of being struck by the skip.
The shaft timbors separating the com
partments aro so constructed in the
Argonaut that it is difficult, indeed al
most impossible, to pass from one com
partment to the other except at the
various stations. And yot the unfor
tunate victim fell in the center com
partment, as evidenced by his boots
which were found in that compartment,
torn from his feet in his fearful plunge
to death. It is supposed to have hap
pened in this wise. The shift's work
was done. The skip was coming down,
delivering men going to work at. the
various levels, and taking aboard those
who had finished their shift. Kanso
vich says he called to Goss, "The skip
is coming." Goss thereupon endeavor
ed to get to the station a few feet below
him, for the purpose of being taken to
the top. Whether he slipped into the
shaft after reaching the station, or fell
while making his way to the station is
unknown. He fell 255 feet— from the
1690 level to 15 feet below the 1930 level.
His neck was broken, and his head
badly battered by contact with the
timbers. He was no doubt dead before
he reached the end of his fall.
Coroner Huborty held an inquest the
saipe morning, before the following
jurors: A. Ginocchio, V. M. Colt, W.
U. Dufreno, P. Podesta, Jos. Plant,
W. P. Peek, M. Newman and K. C.
Hust. After hearing all the testimony
that could be produced to throw light
on the tragedy, the jury returned a
verdict that deceased came to his death
by accidentally falling down the shaft,
and that no blame was attached to
any one therefor.
Deceased had been employed at the
Argonaut ever since work was resumed
last fall. He leaves a wife and two
children to mourn his death. He was
a member of tho A. O. U. W., and in
sured for $1000. He was also a member
of the miners' union, and was buried
under tho auspices of these orders on
Thursday afternoon."
Death of John Jeffery.
John Jeffory, a young man well and
favorably known throughout the
greater portion of Amador county,
passed away at tho St. Joseph hospital
in Stockton on Wednesday morning
after a brief illness. Just two weeks
before bis death Mr. Jeffery quit his
work at the Kennedy mine, complain
ing of a severe pain In his side. The
doctor prescribed, and for a few days
everything seemed to be alright. Rea
lizing that his ailment was a serious
case of appendicitis that called for an
operation, his physician advised him to
go to Stockton for that purpose. On
Sunday morning friends started with
him for Stockton, where thi-y arrived
about 11 a. m. After a careful exami
nation by the hospital physicians his
case was considered so serious that
they decided to operate at once, and at
the same time giving his friend, Arthur
Perkin, to understand that there was
little hope of his recovery. He rallied
after the operation, and seemed much
improved until Tuesday, when the un
favorable change took place, and death
released him at 7 o'clock a. m. Wed
desday. His remains were at once pre
pared for shipment, and brought to
Jackson the same day.
Mr. Jeffery was a native of England,
34 years of age. He came to America
15 years ago, and for the past 7 years
has resided in and around Jackson,
whore by his honest dealings and gen
tlemanly ways he had endeared himself
to all with whom he came in contact.
His parents live at Gunpis Lake, Corn
wall, England, while his only brother
resides in Now York City. He was a
member of the Forestors of America
and the Jackson Miners' Union, under
whose auspices he will be buried in the
Protestant cemetery Sunday.
Suicide.
Gubtavus Froolich, who has resided
for many yoars near Martell's station,
and had large property interests in
Amador county, committod suicide at
his homo on Saturday morning, May
14th. Coroner Huborty summoned a
jury, and held an inquest shortly after
his death. From tho facts obtainable
tho jury rendered the verdict that
death was caused from a gunshot
wound inflicted by himself. Mr. Froe
lich was a native of Germany, and 77
years ai age. He leaves a wife and
several grown-ifp children, besides a
large circle of friends to mourn his loss.
The rash act was committed between
7 and 8 o'clock, in the sleeping apart
ment which the deceased occupied apart
from the main dwelling house. Tbo
weapon of destruction was a shotgun,
loaded with No. 4 shot. Two shots
were fired, the reports being very close
together. Tho empty shell was taken
from the gun and placed on the table,
«tnd another cartridge inserted. The
first shot is supposed to have missed
entirely. It is thought thst at the
second discharge the muzzle was placed
in the mouth, or a few inches from the
head. The whole front of the head
above the nostrils was blown off. Ha
had been a sufferer for a long time, his
atllieation taking on a dropsical char
acter. Conscious that he could not get
well, it is thought he concluded to
anticipate the &&&. by violent means.
The funeral was held Monday, the re
mains being interred in the Jackson
graveyard.

grove there, white with blossoms. Oh,
such a breath of fragrance, and many
glowing yellow oranges, yet hanging
among , the glossy leaves and snowy
blossoms. Truly it was- a sight to
make an easterner think of paradise.
Further on tho mellow fields wore being
marked off for corn, melons, and that
great essential to an adequate Thanks
giving—the prosaic pumpkin. The
intervening fields were covered fence
high with wheat and barley, the latter
already turning yellow. At length a
smell — such as we are told characterizes
tho infernal regions — greeted us.
Dense sulphurous vapor obscured the
vision; scant yellow vegetation, dead
and dying trees. What did it mean?
Wo determined to find out. We drove
on, and noticed that the vegetation
gradually became healthier, and that
we saw no more dead trees, and on
every side signs of a bountiful harvest.
Returning in the afternoon the wind
was blowing in the opposite direction,
and we saw at our right a kind of basin
or hollow in the hills bare and brown,
devoid of all vegetation save the dead
brush and tree trunks, black as if
swept by tire, and In the center the
works of the Camp Seco mine. In
quiry elicited the information from a
group of miners that between one hun
dred and one hundred and twenty-five
men are employed in and around the
mine. How we wished to visit it, but
we did not like to go alone. Quite a
large area around the mine is entirely
destitute of vegetation; then succeeds
a belt that is sparsely covered with
yellow sickly weeds, and grass about
an Inch high, and where a few old pines
still live. Gradually the vegetation
assumes a greener hue. At Mr.
Nichols' place, where we used to see
grain a couple of feet high at this time
of year, there was not much but sickly
looking "poverty grass" about six
inches high, starved and yellow looking.
We were glad to get out of the
"smoked" area Into the country of
thrifty grain and grass. Tho sight of
Nature in the throes of death was sad
dening. Polly and I.

THE AETHUE STONE FATALITY
How the Unfortunate Victim Came to
His Death as Revealed by the
Inquest.
From the report of the coroner's in
quest held on the 6th of May to in
quire into the facts connected with the
accident at tho Bunker Hill mine by
which Arthur Stone, the acting fore
man, was instantly killed while em
ployed in the shaft, we are enabled to
gleam the following particulars. The
following persons constituted the jury:
J. R. Tregloan, B. White, W. E.
Whltehead, O. E. Martin, Chas Gillis
and G. C. Davis. It appears that on
the fatal morning Arthur Stone was in
the shaft at the 800 foot level. Louis
Galli, an experienced machinist, was at
the engine. Two miners, John Chey
noweth and Louis Chasa, were at the
200 foot level, employed in taking old
timbors out of the tuiiWl at that point,
and putting new oues in their place.
As the old timbers were removed they
were loaded on the skip and sent on
top. They had already sent up two
sticks, 8 feet long and 20 inches thick,
to tho surface. They were employed
in loading the third, when the mishap
occurred. They wanted the skip low
ered 6or 8 Inches, so that they could
tilt the timber over into the skip
while it was below them. Two bells
was given, the signal to lower, and the
engineer promptly responded by start
ing to lower. Another bell was theu
rung, and the bells were so close to
gether that the engineer interpreted
the signals as 2-1 bells, which means to
hoist, which he at once started to do,
very slowly, raising the skip some ten
or twelve feet. Tho skip, owing to this
confusion of signals, was hoisted away
from the men before -they could load
the timber. It was too heavy for thorn
to hold as It hung over the shaft, and
In this way it fell. Whether It struck
Stone at the 800 level, or whether the
victim fell down the shaft as the re
sult of the falling timber, is nut known.
The probability is— from the terribly
mangled condition of the body— that
he was hit by the timber. The body
was found- 30 feet bulow the 800 iovel,
stradding a sill, with his head hanging
down. He was dead when found. The
investigation disclosed that the acci
dent was caused by faulty signaling.
The 2-1 bells were intended by the
workers bylow for two signals— 2 to
lower, and 1 to stop— whereas they
were given in such quick succession
that the engineer — who has to be gov
erned entirely by the signals—under
stood them as one signal — the cus
tomary signal to hoist. Tho jury found
a verdict of accidental death, and
exonerated the mine management from
all blame in connection therewith.
Bench Warrant.
The first bench warrant ordered is
sued by the superior court of Amador
county during the administration of
county clerk Culbert was made out
Wednesday, directing Sheriff Norman
to produce John Pritchard, of Ply
mouth, in court on Thursday at 10
o'clock a. m., as a witness in tho John
Ekel case. After testifying he was
ordered iDto the custody of the sheriff
until the case was concluded, and at
the termination of the trial he was sen
tenced to 24 hours in the county jail
for contempt of court. ;"

The Eailroad Project.
It is freely reported on the street
that a hitch has occurred in connection
with the construction of the railroad
from lone to Jackson and Sutter Creek
by the newly organized lone and East
ern Railroad Company. The corps of
surveyors who have been making a
survey for a route from lone to Sutter
Creek by way of Mount Echo for the
past two weeks, wore all laid off last
Tuesday. This action came suddenly
and unexpectedly. The notice of appli
cation for franchise has been published
the required length of time in the
Stokton Mail, and the bids for the
franchise will be received by the super
visors at their next regular meeting on
June 6. The reason for the stoppage
of work at this time is not clear. It is
said that the parties who were expect
ed to invest in the enterprise are not
satisfied with the terms of the fran
chise as outlined in the published notice;
that the right of way in regard to the
highways and streets is too restrictive,
and that work has been suspended
until the franchise can be atnondod to
suit. It is hardly probable that this is
the true cause of the trouble, as the
nature of the concessions to be granted
by the supervisors has been definitely
known for three weeks, during which
time active operations have been push
ed ahead. It is rumored that the com
pany is to be reorganized, and new ap
plication for franchise made. Both
Jackson Dennis and Wilford Dennis
have been away several days this week,
presumably on this railroad business.
"Tale of a Whale and Whale of a Tale."
We call attention to an article taken
from the Saturday Globe of Utlca, New
York, relating the antics of one James
Dunn, an alleged prodigal millionaire,
who died recently in Paris. The story
was sent to the Ledger by some un
known party, probably for the reason
that Amador county is mentioned as
the scene of this eccentric man's rise
from poverty to wealth. If other parts
of the story are as truthful as those
touching Amador county, the whole
may be branded as a Munchausen yarn
from beginning to end. To those who
have lived in Amador county for the
last twenty or thirty yoars the huge
story will be read with amusement, as
showing what preposterous ideas of
California men and conditions are
swallowed by the easterners. Here we
never heard of a bonanza known as the
Big Jennie lode, which is given as the
foundation of Dunn's career of wealth.
The incidents mentioned in connection
with the last smallpox outbreak in
Amador county are also fabrications.
The days of '49 palo into insignificance
by the side of this gilded yarn of Cal
ifornia doings which is being dished up
for the edification of tho eastern people.

The Ekel Trial.
TJys trial of J. J. Ekel of Plymouth,
charged with assault with a deadly
weapon with intent to commit mur
der ." upon Edward Keyes on the
morning of January Ist last, was com
menced in the superior court Wednes
day morning. The following persons
were sworn to try the case: G. W.
Vandament, D. Berta, H. Lehmann, J.
D. Nichols, J. H. Griffin, Henry Griffin,
Geo. R. Evans, R. W. Barnett, W.
Parrow, Henry Weil, J. Bales and John
Mitchell. The evidence showed that
Ekel and Keyes were on friendly terms.
At an early hour January Ist the two
were playing cards in Coster's saloon
in Plymouth. A dispute arose over
the game. Both men were under tho
influence of drink, Ekel so much so, on
his own admission, that he hardly
remembered what he did. After the
breaking up of the game over a dis
pute, the men went outside, Coster say-
Ing that he would not have any trouble
in his house. Ekel drew his pistol and
fired in front of the saloon, / the ball
striking the sidewalk. He re-entered
the saloon, held the pistol in one hand,
and resting the weapon on the other
again fired. Keyes stooped down, on
seeing him, and the ball lodged in tbe
top of the ice chest. Keyes grabbed
Ekel by the legs, and threw him down,
and Ekel was disarmed. Defendant
claimed that he had no ill will toward
Keyes, and the shooting was aimless,
done in a drunken freak. The prosecu
tion contended that it was done with
criminal intent. Ekel next morning
expressed himself as sorry for the oc
currence, saying that as a rule, when
he shot he meant business.
The defendant conducted his own de
fense. The jury after half a hour's de
liberation, returned a verdict of guilty
of assault with a deadly weapon. Tues
day has been appointed for passing
sentence, with bonds for his appear
ance for sentence fixed at $2500. The
maximum imprisonment for this offense
is two years either in the state prison
or county jail.

year the number reported was 4so; this

tion of school population means a loss
of one teacher. The decline of juvenile
population of all ages, including those
under 5 yes rs of age, is not so marked.
Last year the total was 619 against 604
this year— a falling off of 15. The
figures are subject to correction by the

It Comes From Latin and Originally
Meant Cope or Canopy.
The word "chapel" comes from the
low Latin capella, a cope or canopy,
and was applied to a recess or chapel
attached to the altar. >s
Used originally of the place where
the cappa or cope of St. Martin was
preserved, the word came in the eighth
century to signify any sanctuary where
holy relics were kept and thence a con
secrated building connected with a
church or cathedral. At this period
also domestic oratories and places of
worship for such corporate bodies as
colleges began to be called chapels.
Apart from its present day meaning,
as applied to any place of worship
which is not a parish church, such as a
chapel of ease or a nonconformist
chapel, the word denotes the ecclesi
astical staff of a sovereign, the sacred
office recited by the pope with his
.household and the working staff of a
printing office, because the first one in
England was set up by Caxton in
Westminster abbey.
The Vice of Nagging;-
Nagging may or may not be a vice
of the thin,' as a famous physician sug
gests, but that there is some truth in
his theory that there is a scientific
basis for this ugly habit seems likely.
"Perfect health," he says, "has as one
of its factors content of mind. A nerv
ous man or woman who is anxious,
discontented, gloomy, dissatisfied, wor
ried from any cause, cannot enjoy good
health. This mental turmoil produces
as one of its primary effects on the
body an inability to digest food prop
erly. The blood which should supply
the force necessary for the function
of digestion is continually drawn away
from the stomach by excitement In
the brain, and the woman who nags
suffers. While there be those whose
tendency to lay on fat is so great that
nothing will stop it a nagging man or
woman is generally thin. Their habit
of mind has partially starved their
bodies."
Accommodating.
The buzzards enjoy the same "sa
credjiess" in the New river district of
West- Virginia as they, do in tropicnl
countries. A breaker boy was brought
before a squire in a coal mining town
on the charge of having killed one of
the only scavengers of that country.
After severely reprimanding the boy
the old squire, who was a German
said: "I fine you $10!"
"I hain't got thet much," replied the
boy.
"Den I fine you $5!"
"I hain't got $5."
"Veil, how much haf you got?"
"Three dollars and seventy-five cents."
"All right; den I fine you $3.75!"
Brain Growth.
Brain development is found by Pro
fessor Seggel of Munich to have two
periods of acceleration, from ten to
eleven and from seventeen to eighteen
in girl* and from twelve to thirteen
and nineteen to twenty in boys. At
the period of most rapid increase in
height, from twelve to fourteen years,
the growth of the brain is less than
one-hundredth that of the body, but at
seventeen to nineteen it grows one
thirtieth as fast and at twenty reaches
one-s«venth of the body growth.

A Serious Offenae.
Mr. Banks had acquired a dictatorial
manner In his youth, and it had grown
with his years. When he gradually
became nearsighted, he refused to
wear glasses and held other people re
sponsible for any difficulties into which
his failing sight led him. One day he
clutched by the coat sleeve a man who
was^Jurrying past him on the street.
"I want a word with you, Mr.
Griggs," he said sharply. "I will de
tain you only a moment."
"My name is not Griggs. You have
made a mistake," said the man.
"Your name isn't Griggs!" said Mr.
Banks, still detaining the stranger and
peering into his face. "I should like
to know why not?"

A LESSON IN MANNERS.
The Way a Clever American Woman
Mnnagred a DuUe.
A story which belongs to a time sev
eral years ago when an English duke
was a much sought after personage In
New York society is told by Mr. James
L. Ford in "The Brazen Calf:"
This duke, contemptuously noting
the eagerness with which New York
ers fawned upon him, had formed tbe
habit of sting out to dinner without
troubling biinself to put on evening
dress. A l;..iy had invited him to din
ner without knowing of this peculiar
ity and whs awaiting his ar. 1 when
her butler opened the door and cast a
glance at her over the Wads of Inter
vening: guests which saia plainly that
something was wrong.
She hastened into the hall to find tbe
fluke standing there clad. in the checked
sack suit and flaming red tie which
had seemed to him "good enough" for
a dinner party of American calf wor
shipers. This woman, however, had
presence of mind, and she advanced
upon him radiant and smiling.
"No," she said decisively as she took
him by the huud; "I won't accept any
excuses. You've come round to tell mo
why it is that you can't dine here to
night, and it's ever so much nicer of
you to do that, than just to send a note.
The dinner's a little late, and you've
just time to go home and dress and be
back here before we begin."
The nobleman opened his mouth to
reply, but bis hostess shut him off in a
second: "No; you needn't make any
explanations or excuses. Remember,
you've only twenty minutes, so you
must hurry." ... 1,
A moment later the astounded duke
found himself hurrying toward his ho
tel and perhaps wondering what new
social forco it was that was impelling
him in that direction.
A WOMAN'S POINT OF VIEW.
The Things That Most Impressed a
Feminine Tourist Abroad.
"What impressed you most?" said
the gushing girl to the woman who
had just returned from a trip abroad.
"You must have seen such wonderful
things."
The we nan who had traveled
thought di :-ply a few minutes; then
she said slowly: "I think it was the
lack of napkins in Scotland. Yes, that
was it. Jfy dear, there isn't a sign of
a napkin o-i the tables in Scotland. If
you ask for one, you may get It, and
then again you may not. I was en
tertained in the homes of some of the
finest people, in Scotland, and never a
napkin did I get. .v J
"The next most impressive thing
was the size of the coins in England.
I used up ii great deal of good, nerv
ous energy trying ways and means to
stuff those cart wheels into my little
purse. One day, when my pocketbook
had become unusually clumsy, I be
came almost hysterical", and that night
I dreamed that I was using belt
buckles for the coin of the realm.
"There's one queer thing, though.
You know I never could get it througli
my head how one made double change.
You know what I mean— some one
gives you too 'much change, and then
you give them some money, and it's
all right or something of that sort.
Well, I never could understand that
process in good United States money,
with which I'm more or less familiar,
but over there in England I accom
plished that feat again and again
without a tremor. Don't nsk me how
I did it. I don't know. It just came
to me. Can I do it now in United
States money? No, I can't. I left that
special ability behind in England."—
New York Tribune.
General Gordon's Wile
Through the entire civil war General
Gordon's wife accompanied him, never
leaving his side save when the ex
igencies of campaign made her pres
ence impossible. To the faithful de
votion of liis wife General Gordon
owed his life. In the bloody battle of
Sharpsburg, Gordon, while in tbe
midst of the carnage, was shot five
times. As soon as he fell his wife
rushed to his side and carried him to
safety, stanching the" flow of blood and
attending his wounds until medical aid
could be procured. She remained with
him in tho hospital until he had recov
ered, and when General Gordon went
back to join his command Mrs. Fan
nie Haralson Gordon followed her hus
band.
The Annual Dath In the Ganges.
The largest regular assemblage of
people in the world is said to be the
crowd which gathers annually at
Benares, in India, to bathe in the
Ganges. A large temple, or rather a
series of buildings, is on the shore at
this point, while steps reach down to
the water's edge. The Hindoos crowd
upon this bank in enormous numbers,
the crowd at times numbering upward
Of 50,000. As the natives are dressed
in the brightest colors, the crowd gives
the impression of an enormous bed of
flowers.
Disappointed.
A small miss who had but recently
mastered her catechism confessed her
disappointment with it thus: "Now, I
obey the fifth commandment and honor
my papa and mamma, yet my days are
not a bit longer in the land, for I'm
put to bed every night at 7 o'clock just
the same."
The Little Thinga That Fret.
"My, but the old man's a most un
reasonable growler!"
"You think so?"
"I know It. Why, he's growlin' from
mornln' till night, an' all on earth he
has to do is to pay all the bills for the
fnmlly."— Atlanta Constitution.

ON THE PARIS 'CHANGE.
A Place Among the Seventy Costa
About Three Million Franca.
It may be said that a seat among
the seventy (they call it a charge) costs
about 3,000,000 francs ($600,000) or
sometimes 2,500,000, and a charge
earns from 5 to 15 per cent (net) a
year, so that tbe annual profits are
from $30,000 to $00,000, or more In ex
ceptional years. But these are usually
divided among several associates, for
It rarely happens that an agent is the
sole owner of his seat More often he
has paid for only half of it or a third
of it and has three or four silent part
ners, who own the rest and who may
again have subpartners, so that you
will hear of a person owning an eighth
or a sixteenth of a seat or even a thir
ty-second, these seing simple invest
ments that carry no rights or privi
leges on the bourse.
As to procuring a charge, the thing
has none of the Stock Exchange sim
plicity, where the main requirement
for getting a seat is to be able to pay
for it Here a candidate must be a
Frenchman and at least twenty-five
years old. He must have served four
years in certain forms of business. He
must be personally acceptable to the
agent from whom he would purchase
the seat and often to his family, in
cluding the ladles. He must be passed
upon by the seventy with formal vot
ing, as if he were Joining some select
clubi which he is. There must be no
stain on his business record and no
slur on his personal character. A can
didate was rejected recently for bad
habits and another for no fault of his
own, but because his brother had been
concerned in questionable transactions.
With all this favorably settled there is
still needed the approval of the minis
ter of finances and tbe sanction of the
head of the government — Cleveland
Moffett in Century.
A RICH GOLD MINE.
For Several Years Eager Fortune
Seekers Worked Over It.
A tale is told of a rich gold mine in
Idaho with a ledge of ore which once
extended above the surface of the
ground in a clear, solid ridge several
feet high and entirely distinct from tbe
surrounding formation. This ledge was
long and unbroken and lay directly
across the course which hundreds of
prospectors took every year to reach
other gold fields. This obstruction of
rock, the great value of which was
long unknown, was too high to be sur
mounted by pack animals, so the pros
pectors cut a trail directly through it.
For several years these eager gold seek
ers passed backward and forward over
this trail in search of gold mines. One
night a prospector camping near this
ledge of rock picked up a bit of it and
from force of habit took it to a creek
near by and washed it. Then be exam
ined the stone, and, to his great aston
ishment, he found "colors" in it— bits
of sparkling gold. The prospector does
not mistake gold when he sees it. He
is not deluded by iron crystals or bits
of mica, as the "tenderfoot" frequent
ly is. The gold sparkle is clearer and
brighter than that of any other miner
al, and it is the same In sunshine and
shadow.
The prospector, tremendously excit
ed, broke off more pieces of the ledge
and found more of It bearing free gold.
Then be located his claim, and that
was Kie beginning of a rich mine. Yet
for years the sagest of prospectors had
passed over this trail through the cut
in this ledge, never suspecting its val
ue, although by its very prominence it
seemed to invite inspection. — Leslie's
Weekly.
An Italinn llriivanil'n Home.
Ainou;.; south Italian brigands even
their horses iire taught to resist the
officers of the law. During the en
counter at Itaua Bucea, in which the
brigand Mirto was killed, the geii
daruierie was amazed by the furious
behavior of his horse, which lashed out
on all sides, and succeeded in injuring
one of the officers. On inquiry after
ward among the prisoners taken it was
ascertained that the horse had been
trained to behave in this way by being
repeatedly Hogged until he kicked one
of the brigands, dressed as a carabi
neer, approaching him. The horse at
last became such an adept that he
might be relied upon to kick and rear
furiously at the mere sight of a uni
form.— London Globe.
lloiißh on the Lawyers.
They havo a way of settling lawsuits
in India that it would be well to copy
here, according to the Springfield Re
publican. When a dispute arises over
the ownership of land two holes are
dug near together and the two oppos
ing lawyers nicely planted up to their
waists. The first one to become bitten
by a bug or becomes so exhausted that
he has to be exhumed loses the case
for his client. This does away with
unnecessary talking and adds an in
teresting element of chance to the
game.
Scott Was Rated aa a Dance.
As a boy Walter Scott gave few in
dications of his coming greatness and
was described by. one of his early pre
ceptors as "the boy that has the thick
est skull In the school." Afterward at
Edinburgh university the future "wiz
ard" was thus epitomized by one of the
leading professors: "Dunce he is, and
dunce he will remain."

WILLING TO HELP.
An Old Seaman's Scheme to Win
Honor For- a Favorite.
An amusing story is told of an old
seaman on one of the United States
cruisers in the north Atlantic squad
ron, lie was not a person of wide af
fections, but he had a warm place in
his heart for a young ensign who had
been kind to him in many little ways.
One day a landsman fell from the
rigging to the water, and as he could
not swim he would have been drowned
but for a young officer who sprang in
after him and held him up till assist
ance came.
Later the young officer received a
complimentary letter from the secre
tary of the navy. Every one rejoiced
but the old seaman; he coveted the let
ter for his ensign.
"That's a nice thing to have, a letter
like that," he said a few days later.
"You ought to have one."
"I don't quite see how I can get one,"
laughed the ensign. 'z':'*k :
"Well, see here," said the old man
eagerly. "Tomorrow night I'll be in
the main chains, fussing with some
thing or other, and I might fall in, and
you could jump after me."
"That would be very good of you,"
said, the ensign gravely, "but you see,
I'm not a good swimmer by any
means."
"Ho, that's no matter!" said the old
seaman. "I'll hold you up till the boat
comes."
CRACKED VOICES.
A Lack of Muscular Control Is What
Causes the Break.
The pitch of the human voice de
pends primarily upon the number of
vibrations per second of the vocal
cords, and these, in their turn, depend
on the length, size and degree of ten
sion of the cords, which increase in
length with the growth of the larynx.
One of the deepest bass notes, from
the greater length of the cords, has
only eighty double vibrations a second,
while a soprano voice can give 092
such vibrations in the same time.
The size of a lad's larynx Is, roughly,
that of a woman's, but when the pip
ing schoolboy is shooting up into man
hood bis l:u'ynx grows rapidly and the
vocal cords become elongated nearly in
the proportion of three and a half to
two. The cartilages by which their
tension is regulated also share in this
growth, as is seen by the swelling of
the so called "Adam's apple." \'
Now, all these parts do not increase
with equal rapidity; hence the muscu
lar control, which must be very exact,
is rendered uncertain and the voice is
said to "break." A similar change
takes place in the case of women, but
very much less in amount, and a fur
ther compensation in the formation of
the upper part of the larynx serves to
disguise the effect.
COLUMBUS' CREWS.
One Engllxhmnn and One Irishman
Were Among Their Number.
An Englishman and an Irishman
were among the sturdy 120 ad
venturers who sailed with Columbus
in the three small hundred tonners.
This may have been due to the well
known fact that nothing brings men of
different races together more than
maritime and commercial enterprise,
or, still more probably, because they
were swept in at Palos, when Colum
bus put the press gang to work, as he
was authorized to do by Ferdinand
and Isabella.
The names of these men, as given
by Navarrete, were Jallarte de Lajes,
Ingles (probably Arthur Lake, Eng
lish), and Guillermo Ires, naturel de
Galney, en Irlanda (probably William
Herries or Rice, native of Galway, In
Ireland).
These two men were among the
forty whom Columbus left behind In
the fort constructed In Hispaniola be
fore he sailed for Europe, who all met
their death at the hands of the natives
before the great discoverer returned,
owing to their disregard of his express
directions.
The Cocoanut Tree.
There is no tree so widely distributed
throughout the tropics as the cocoanut
Even on remote atolls of the south
seas, which geologists say were only
recently formed by the subsidence of
a volcano and the growth of coral up
from its base, one finds the cocoanut.
The parent tree leaning over the beach
of one tropical island drops its fruit
into the sea, to have the nut carried
away perchance halfway round the
world. Then in some faraway place
the waves cast the cocoanut ashore to
sprout and propagate another forest
after its own kind.
The Apple.
The apple is not considered to be a
complete food in itself, but on the food
list it has a value far above the nutri
ment It possesses. Apples aid the
stomach in the digestion of other foods,
and therefore the best results are ob
tained from eating them after rather
than before meals. After partaking of
an unusually heavy dinner the eating
of ,n apple will be found to facilitate
an early digestion and afford great re
lief from the sufferings attendant upon
indigestion.
Too Mucli Reallam.
"Do you not feel at times," remarked
the fireside critic, "that realism can be
carried too far on the stage?"
"Yes," replied the tragic actor, with
a sigh. "The last man I was working
for did it He wanted to pay us all
off in stage money."— Cincinnati Times-
Coming and Going.
"Hello, Hike! Do you find much to
do now?"
"Yls. I'm jest after cuttin' down a
tree, "and tomorrow I'll have to cut It
up."— Kansas City World.
