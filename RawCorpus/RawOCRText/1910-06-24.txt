HOSPITAL WORK
New Porch Replaces De
cayed Structure
Improvements are still being pur
sued at the county hospital. A new
porch is now in course of construction,
the old one was completely rotted
away. Zeph Dal Porto has the con
ract, and is giving the county a job
that will reflect credit upon him.
Superintendent Burke faces many
needed improvements. The building
was, as the grand jury reported, in a
most deplorable condition. Drainage
pipes, supply pipes, decayed timbers
from roof to cellar were allowed to go
unrepaired, and the building was fast
becoming disgrace to the county.

RESCUES A LIFE
Mine Hero Saves Com
rade from Death <
Paul Veramenta, residing with his
uncle, Paul Veramento in South Jack
son, received severe injuries while at
work in the Zeila mine that would
have proved fatal had it not been for
the presence of mind and hasty action
of a fellow worker. The young miner,
who is not much more than 19 years
old, was ordered to load the skip with
old timbers, etc. at the 1500 level, and
then to send the skip to the surface by
ringing 1 bell. As the unfortunate
man explains it, he desired the skip to
lower a bit further, and gave what he
thought was the correct bell. The skip
started up, and the miner attempted
to jump off the top of the filled skip,
into the 1500 level. As he jumped from
the moving bucket he was caught be
tween the skip and the timbers and
badly squeezed. His cry was heard by
Lazar Radon ja, who in an instant
reached out and grabbed the victim as
the skip was passing him, and when
released from his dangerous position,
Raonja pulled him into the level, and
thereby saved him from a plunge of
160 feet to the sump of the shaft. The
injured man was hastily sent to the
surface and a team was sent from a
local livery that carried the miner to
the home of his uncle. Dr. Endicott
is attending the unfortunate man and
reports no bones are broken.
SCHOLARS PASS
High Average is Made^by
Pupils for Term Past
The following figures show the vast
importance of having a high school in
Amador county. Jackson has 29
pupils who graduated from the Gram
mar school this season, who expressed
their intentions of attending a high
school, and 4 who said they were un
able to do so. Sutter Creek has 11
who wish to attend a high school, and
6 who areunable to do so. Plymouth
has 12 who desire to go to high school,
and 5 who cannot attend. Volcano's
students 3 to 1 stated they had no in
tention to attend any high school, and
this is mainly by reason of the heavy
expense incurred in so doing. lone
has 13 who intend to finish high school
and only 1 who does not intend to do
so. • This district stands out then to
prove the assertion, that a high school
located near the county seat would get

Greenhalgh and George W. Brown on
limestone land belonging to Messrs
Gebhardt, Sibole and Henderson in

$7600, paid in stock of the corporation.
Ten per cent of the capital stock sub

amounting to over $6000 in cash. With
this in the treasury it is proposed to
pay the first instalment of the pur
chase price, amounting to over $1600,
which falls due early next month.
Deeds for the lands included in the
option will be placed in escrow this
week, to be delivered to the company
upon the final payment of the agreed
price. As soon as these matters are

STOCK VICTIMS
Wireless Fraud Catches
Many In Jackson
There are quite a number of victims
of the United Wireless Telegraph
fraud in Jackson and other parts of
the county. The amounts invested
ranged from $100 to $500. They were
led to put their savings into this
scheme by the representations of
agents engaged in the selling of stock,
and these agents were in most cases
victims of fraudulent misrepresenta
tions on the part of the higher-ups of
the company. They no doubt believed
they were soiling stook in a company
that bade fair to rival the Bell tele
phone and similar corporations, which
have made many persons wealthy by
the investment of a few hundred dol
lars therein. The conditions of the
wireless telegraph business aided the
schemers. It was a new enterprise
comparatively, with almost unlimited
possibilities before it, and a vast field

A MODERN ADAM
Stinson Veils Threats at
Defenseless Women
When Richard Webb said in his paper
that his was the only office in
Amador county in which a full-sheet
two-color poster could be printed, he
deliberately and maliciously lied. That
is what was said last week, and here
repeat. — Record.
The worst form of lying is to at
tribute a statement to another that
was never made, and then proceed to
abuse the individual for having said it.
This is the dernier resort of the un
scrupulous when routed in open and
above-board discussion. It is the spirit
of ambushed assailant. In journalism it
is called "conjuring up an enemy fw
the satisfaction of knocking him down.
That seems to be the only role the
Record man is capable of playing to
advantage. It is an all-sufficient an*
swer to the above to say that the
Ledger has never made any such state
ment as is therein attributed to it.

Well Known Character
Passes to His Rest
Gormey Gregorio, a character well
known to many Jackson residents, died
at the county hospital, and was laid to
his final resting place last Monday
afternoon at 4 p. m. The services
were conducted by Father Laffan.
Gregorio was a native of Venezuela.
He migrated to California in 1849 see k;

himself to a musician, and his guitar
furnished much amusement to those
who cared to listen to his old time
tunes.
Foot Badly Smashed
John Garbarino had his left foot
mashed last night, by a heavy log fal

the Kennedy mine, and his injury will
Incapicitate him from work for some

POOR BALL GAME
Local Team A/lakes Bad
Show with Plymouth
Sunday's exhibition at the local ball
park, between Jackson and Plymouth,
was too one-sided to be enjoyed, Ply
mouth was in no stage of the game in
danger of defeat, while Jackson was
completely held at the mercy of the
visitors' pitcher, Johnny Burke, who
threw a ball that only Jackson's best
sluggers could find.
Plymouth had a batting streak on
that would make any local pitcher
sick, and hit ball after ball into out
field. A. Prichard, catcher for the
Plymouth nine, put a ball past Arditto
into center field that gave him an easy
home run, in the sixth inning. For
this play he was presented with a box
of Elko cigars by M. P. Silva, the
local dealer. Easton, the Plymouth
second baseman, played a strong
game, bringing in 4 runs, and having
4 put outs to his credit. The Plymouth
nins are managed by Earl Ninnis,
proprietor of the Plymouth livery
stable and captained by A. Prichard,
the catcher for his own team.
Very little can be said for Jackson's
last game, appreciating the fact that
the players receive no salary for the
strenuous parts they play in giving
Jackson baseball amusement; we are
compelled to say that lack of proper
management is surely pulling the

Kennedy's team is very well man
aged, and the boys have played fine
ball all season. Their new suits ar
rived too late to be used in their game
with Amador, but will be worn next
Sunday in their game with the Zeila.
Jos. Raggio, second baseman on the
Kennedy team made a grandstand
play in a long run to bring down a
flyball, thereby putting a man out.

JOHNSON'S PECULIAR STAND.
Hiram Johnson, candidate of the Lincoln-Roosevelt fac
tion for the republican nomination for governor, assumes a
very illogical position from a party standpoint. All the other
aspirants for this office have signified their intention of sup
porting the party nominee as determined by the voters at the
primary election. This is the only straight and honorable
course, and is in accordance with time-honored custom. But
Johnson refuses to line up with his fellow candidates on this
proposition. He will not pledge himself beforehand to sup
port the party nominee. He has always been a free-lance
in politics anyway, aud is resolved to continue in the same
role notwithstanding he is touring the state and making
frantic appeals for republican votes as the representative of
simon-pure republicanism. This will strike the average
party man as extraordinary and inconsistent. The fouuda
tion of party organization is submission to the will of the
majority. In the convention system it was customary to
pledge a candidate to the support of the ticket, whether he
himself was nominated or not. The direct primary law does
not impair party loyalty; if anything it makes it more im
perative. He is required under the new law, before starting
out his nominatiou petitions, to file a sworn statement to the
effect that he is affiliated with the party organization; that
he voted for a majority of its candidates at the last election,
and intends doing the same at the forthcoming election. But
Johnson does not wish this pledge to tie him down on the
head of the ticket in case one of his republican rivals hap
pens to be selected as the standard-bearer. Reading between
the lines, this means that Johnson is not likely to vote for a
republican governor unless; he himself gets away with the
plum at the primaries. This kind of platform is not much
of a recommendation to party voters. Johnson lacks the
essential elements of a party candidate. He belongs in the
ranks of the independents, and to be consistent ought to be
seeking a place on the ballot as an independent candidate.
His chance of winning the republican nomination rests upon
there being so many candidates of that party in the field.
In a straight-out contest between the Lincoln-Roosevelt wing
and those out of sympathy — not with their principles but
with their methods — the insurgents would be hopelessly out
voted. But a plural ty votes nominates, and therein lies the
hope of the Johnson faction. Even with these conditions we
do not believe his nomination is at all probable.
Governor Gillett's decisive stand not to permit the Jefferies-
Johnson fight to take place in California commands the ap
proval of right-thinking people. California has suffered in
a moral sense in public estimation from the number of prize
fights which have been pulled off within her territory. The
cohorts of pugilism have come to look upon this state as a
sure asylum for their operations. Gillett has had the courage
to stop the business, when a fistic battle of world-wide in
terest was scheduled to take place. Naturally business men
in San Francisco are chagrined over the governor's action.
They were calulating upon a big boost in business incident
to influx of thousands of sports to witness the great slugging
match. But their temporary disappointment is not worth
considering when weighed against the reputation of the city
and state.
The republican state central committee has issued a call
for a state convention to be held iv September. The basis
of representation is one delegate for each 500 votes or major
ity fraction cast for the party at the last presidential election.
This gives Amador two delegates. Heretofore the apportion
ment has been one delegate for every 250 votes. As the only
purpose of a state convention is to formulate a party platform
and select a new state committee, there is not likely to be
much of a scramble for the honor of going to the state con
vention. It seems borderiug on the ridiculous, andi s cer
tainly contrary to party usage, to nominate candidates first,
and fix up a platform for them to stand upun afterwards.
This reversal of the usual order of things may cause a heap
of trouble hereafter. The two delegates allotted to Araador
must be elected at a county convention to be called not later
than two weeks after the August primary, at which primary
delegates to the county convention must be chosen.

Pellagra, which has given much alarm
in the United States, is a great scourge
in south-eastern Europe, and a serious
disorder in the West Indies, Egypt and
elsewhere. Among its first symptoms
is usually a kind of sunburn" of face,
chest and hands. This is followed by
skin rash, catarrh of stomach and in
testines, feverishness, lassitude and
weakness, and as the trouble recurs in
spring and autumn year after year, the
weakness increases, and often leads lo
lunacy and death. The disease has been
generally attributed to eating damaged
Indian corn. Believing it to be infec
tious, Dr J. J.Wolfe, of Durham, N.C.,
has been lately seeking its organism in
pellagrous blood and has obtained some
spherical bacteria, without certain evi
dence that they are the cause of the
disease. He has found a similar organ
ism in a culture from damaged Indian
corn. On the other hand. Dr L. W.
Sambon, a British investigator, has
long doubted the accepted theory, and
in a recent visit to Italy with a Pellag
ra investigation committee, he con
vinced himself definitely that Indian
corn is not a cause of pellagra. The
evidence tended to show that the dis
ease is due to a parasite conveyed by
the simulium reptans, a kind of sand
fly breeding on stones along the
streams of pellagrous countries.
• The yellow color of balloons has re
sulted from necessity, not chance or
idle fancy. Lieut-Col. Espitallier, a
French aeronaut, explains that the tex
tile fabric of the balloon is made im
permeable by a layer of caoutchouc,
and that this, even when vulcanized, is
rapidly disintergated by violet or ultra
violet light, so that it must be protect
ed by a yellow pigment to absorb the
harmful rays. A new yellow pigment
is much wanted, however, as neither
the chromate of lead used in France
nor the anilin dye of Germany is satis
factory.
A process for combining pure rubber
with vegetable fiber so that the latter
penetrates the material in minute
threads in all directions is claimed by
a London tire company. The product
is remarkably tough and resistant to
pressure and tensile strain.
Bertillon's dynamometer, the new
apparatus added to the equipment of
the French police by the famous chief
of the anthropometric service, is ex
pected to interpret the marks of the
burglar's jimmy, and makes it possible
to show whether a forcible entrance
saw made by a man, woman, child, or
several persons. A strong upright steel
frame has a horizontal sliding plate as
a base, with a steel plate sliding in
vertical grooves for the top. The spring
of the top plate is connceted to a dy
namometer capable of registering ver
tical effort up to one ton, and a smaller
dynamometer records the horizontal
pressure on the base plate. Tests are
made by measuring the effort necessary
to reproduce on a suitable board or
other material the marks found on
doors or furniture. Vertical or pres
sure effort is always greater than hori
zontal effort, and a lever 20 inches long
gave a vertical pressure of 300 pounds
simultaneously with a horizontal trac
tion of 330 pounds. On a hard walnut
plank, a strong man can develop a
pressure of 1500 pounds. Point impres
sions are most serviceable in identify
ing the tool used by a burglar, and the
tool indicated is employed in investiga
ting the opening of a window, drawer,
desk, etc.
The resistance of water to a paddle
wheel is utilized in a novel French
brake for motor cars. A bevel-wheel
is loosely mounted on a shaft between
the engine and the gear-box, and can
be clutched to the shaft as desired.
The bevel-wheel meshes with a pinion
having attached a fan or paddle-wheel
in a small water tank. On using the
brake, the paddle is set in motion, and
the resistance of the water exerts a
braking effect that is .considerable at
high speeds, decreasing with lower
rates. '
The elecrtric automatic typewriter
of the Berlin police has added .to the
Btrenuousness of the burglar's profes
sion By means of this instrument, a
robbery at one station can be followed
up within two or three minutes by the
printing and posting up at all stations
in the city and suburbs of notices des
cribing the thieves or giving such in
formation as may be available.
The humble ground nut is at last at
tracting attention as a promising food
product. For ages it has been a great
delicacy to children and pigs, and it is
really an excellent food, of good flavor.
The new radiometer of R. H. Smith,
an English physicist, is designed to
measure the radiation falling on and
absorbed by a dull black rough surface.
An unbroken flat surface is formed by
a coil of more than 60 feet of email
square copper tube, extremely thin, and
the radiant energy in the form of heat
raises the temperature of water flow
ing slowly through this tube. The ab
sorbing surface is very large — one
square foot in area. The water is kept
flowing by gravity at a uniform rate
during each test, and the quantity col
lected is accurately weighed every five
minutes, thermometers graduated to
one-tenth degree centigrade, or one-fifth
iegree Fahrenheit, being used to deter
mine the temperature. In testing open
fires and other house heating arrange
ments, the only use made of the instru
ment so far, from three eighths to three
quarters of a pound of water per min
ute was heated from 6 to 10 degrees P.
The accuracy is very great, practically
all of the heat received being collected
in the water, and so sensitive is the
instrument that on adding a two-inch
cube of fresh coal to a large open fire
a perceptible increase in the indicated
radiation was noted inh one minute.
Glass- plating is the novel method by
w hich two English inventors hope to
prevent the fouling of ships' hulls, even
in tropical waters, The glass, in sec
tions about six inches square, is ap
plied direct to the bare metal with a
special cement of wood pulp, resin and
linseed oil, and a layer of this an
eighth of an inch thick not only holds
the grass very firmly but compensates
for the difference of expansion between
the metal and the glass. Painting' is
unnecessary. The glass is claimed to
make it impossible for any growths to
secure a hold, and it remains firmly
adherent even when cracked with a
hammer.
In a combination of fireless crooker
and electric stove, electric current is
used to give the first heating and start
the cooking, and the hot food completes
the process on standing. The holding
dishes are of aluminum placed one on
top of another, the electric stove is be
neath, and a snugly-fitting insulating
hood covers all. The process is claimed
to be safe and effective. Little elec
tricity is necessary, and meals can be
prepared at less than the ordinary
cost.

Catch Fine Trout
Ernest Tarn and Robert Dornan,
young fisherman from Jackson had an
exciting time with speckled trout
along the Middle fork of the Jackson
Creek Tuesday afternoon. The juve
niles captured about a dozen fine
species measuring as much as 12
inches.
A Woman's Great Idea
is how to make herself attractive. But,
without health, it is hard for her to be
lovely in face, form or temper. A
weak sickly woman will he nervous and
Irritable. Constipation and Kidney
poisons show in pimples, blotches, skin
eruptions and a wretched complexion.
But Electric Bitters always prove a
godsend to women who want health,
beauty and friends. They regulate
stomach, liver and kidneys, purify the
blood; give strong nerves, bright eyes,
pure breath smooth, velvety skin, lovely
complexion, good health. Try them.

enough. Treatment cures habitual con

Bad Accident
One of Al. Dufrene's freight teams
met with a terrible mishap on the road
near Amador Thursday. The brake
got caught someway and could not be
worked while going down a hill, and
the wagon was forced on to the horses
before they could get out of the way.
The impact threw five of the eight off
their feet into a pile, cutting and
bruising them badly. It required some
time to get them out and on their
feet again, and _ probably some are
totally ruined, though none were killed
outright.— Echo.

for the expenditure of all moneys re
ceived from the sale of stock. It was
easy to deceive investors Under these
circumstances. The effect of this
smash-up will be to make It very
difficult for any agents to do much
business in this section hereafter in
the way of inducing people to invest,
no matter how meritorious their pro
jects may seem. The only safe course
is to steer clear of all agents with big
money-making adventures in tow.
There are plenty of reasonably safe
ventures of investments, without
reaching out after such as rest upon

Poor Ball Game

team to pieces, and discouraging the
more able players from doing their
best. Cromer might have been held if
proper conditions had existed, and
Mcrkel was worth keeping on the line
up. Dick Fortner was missed, and the
team that played Sunday's game were
handicapped because of the lack of
team work. Love did his share,
bringing in 2 runs and getting several
hits. Myers is not treated fairly by
many in the crowd, and it will only be
a short time before he quits, he is
a good fielder, and a very valuable
player, and his batting and fielding
are hard to beat, Skelly is a reliable
man, and a valuable player to the
team. He is in the game from the
first to the 9th inning with clean fast
team work, and bats hard, but the
weak points in the team, although
they stand out with great force, are
overlooked by those in authority for
some reason, and the crowd, as a re
sult, is compelled to witness a game
such as was played last Sunday, with
a 19 to 10 score.

What we did say was that the sample
poster loaned to the ladies' committee
could not be duplicated in size and
other respects by any other office in
the county. Now if our amiable bro
ther wants to make issue on that, let
him submit his production for compari
son with the Ledger's sample to any
fair-minded judge. Now, it's put up or
shut up.
Referring to the article from the
ladies' committee which we published
last week, the Record this week
publishes the following dainty morsel .
We hope we will not be compelled to
further pursure this subject in our own
defense, but shall certainly do so if
the occasion demands.
That is out-Adaming Adam. After
shoulding the blame upon the women,
he now goes one better by indulging
in a veiled threat. Isn't that about
the limit.

Mrs Elmer Barney met with a
serious accident one day last week.
They were preparing to leave for their
lower ranch near Sacramento for a
short visit. Mrs Barney went to give
the baby some bread and butter, when
to her horror, she saw the little one
lying under the wheels of the wagon.
This caused her to faint and fall out
of the wagon, which ran over both her
and the baby, breaking her shoulder,
but the baby did not seem to be hurt
at all.

Thomas of Amador City is one of the
parties interested.
The Belluomini cattle will start for
their summer range near Silver lake

Word reached here last night of the
death of an expert accountant named
Sheppard. He was working in the
Calaveras county court house at San
Andreas, and while passing from one
room into another, carrying a type
writer, was stricken dead, before as
sistance could be called.
Harry Gray, a miner employed at
the Kennedy mine, was caved on by a
big bunch of rock Wednesday last, re
ceiving several bad injuries. His
head and shoulders were cut open, and
his back badly bruised. Dr. Gall was
summoned and rendered professional
services.
A driver employed at an lone livery
stable, named Hocking, was celebrat
ing his visit to the county seat by in
dulging in joy water, and as a result
the road became double when he
starrted home. He left Jackson Tues
day morning at 11 a. m., bound, as he
explained for lone, after a night of
revelry here, nothing was seen of him
until the following morning, when
shortly after 3 a. m., a horse was seen
traveling into Jackson at his own gait,
one line dragging in the roadway and
the other held by the drunken driver.
The animal went of his own accord to
the stage sheds, and there the driver
was brought to his senses by the night
watchman. The horse was stabled and
fed, and the stupifled man again
started his journey for lone.
The game of ball between Angela
Camp and Sutter Creek was interest
ing, although the score is a bit one
sided, 8 to 5 in favor of Angels Camp,
the playing was reported good.. Sutter
Creek is playing in hard luck this
season, her team seems to be con
structed of real good material, but
team work is not very apparent.FROM OUR

Last Thursday, deputy sheriff L. J.
Dormody verified a complaint charg
ing Ira R. Allen with the murder of
Luigi Paolo Cose ia, who was found
dead near his home in the neighbor
hood of Mt. Aukum two weeks ago.
Allen was arraigned before Justice
Spencer at 3 o clock Thursday, and,
on motion of the defendant the preli
minary examination was set for Satur
day. June 25th. at 10 o'clock a. m.
The defendant haa retained C. E.
Petera to defend him.— Mt. Democrat.
John Doyle has brought suit against
the Diamond & Caldor R. R. Co. for
$10,000 damages for loss and crippling
of hia right hand by being run over by
one of the Co's cars, about March

a fellow employee was the cause of
his injury. Clarke Howard and C. E.

for plaintiff.— Mt Democrat,
There was quite a serious case of
ptomaine poisoning at Calaveritas one
day this week. It appears that
Wednesday evening, ice cream was
served at Costa's of which quite a
number partook without any bad re
sults. But the next morning young
Dante Bacigaluppi ate some of the
cream that had been left standing in
the freezer over night. He was soon
afterwards seized with violent pains,
and all ..the symptoms of ptomaine
poison. Dr. Cooper of Angels was
summoned, and after a time pulled the
patient out all right. — Prospect.
The lone Copper mine has leased the
Lambing ditch and will pipe the water
to a point not far from the mine, but
which is about twenty feet below the
mine ditch; from there it will be
raised to the propsr level by pumping.

Mrs Geo. Mack has a curiosity. A
pair of linnets built a nest in a grape
vine at her home and when the eggs
were laid in it she took them away
and substituted some canary eggs.
Strange to say, the linnets saw no
difference, but hatched out the cana
ries and are now caring for them with
as much joy as if their own offspring.
—Echo.
While drifting on the 200 level at
the lone Copper mine last week the
original lode was found, and the pros
pects are very fine. — Echo.
It has been a long time since a resi
dence in lone was burglarized, but
that feat was accomplished Thursday
night when thieves removed a screen
from a window in Hiram Heffren's
residence and obtained an entrance to
his room, abstracting therefrom $34
of the coin of ther realm. There is no
clue to the burglar. — Echo.
About 9 o'clock last Sunday morning
the transformer house at the App mine
was discovered ablaze, and it required
the combined force about the premises
to confine the fire to the building in
which it started. For a time it seemed
that the fire would spread to adjacent
buildings, but this was averted by
hard work. The transformer house
was entirely consumed, entailing a
loss of $2500, partly protected by in
surance. The origin of the fire is at
tributed to live wires becoming crossed
in some manner. Pending the build
ing and installation of new equipment
the mill cannot be operated, and the
loss on this account will be greater
than that caused by the fire.—Demo

There are seventeen young ladies
and gentlemen taking the teachers'
examination before the El Dorado
county board of education this week.
The feature of the class of applicants
aside from its size is the number of
young men who show an inclination to
turn their attention to teaching as a
prof ession. —Nugget.
Placerville is the proud possessor of
one of the far famed Chinese Sleeve
dogs, from the royal kennels of Pekin,
which only members of the royal
family are allowed to possess in' the
Flowery Kingdom. During the Boxer
troubles, when the allied armies
marched to Pekin, George Englehardt
secured this prize dog and has pre
sented it to a young lady of this city,
who prizes it very highly, and never
t ires showing it to admiring friends.
It isn't much of a dog for size, but
certainly shows many points of its
royal breeding. —Nugget.

CAN'T BE SEPARATED
Some Jackson People Have
Learned to Get Rid of Both
Backache and kidney ache are twin
brothers.
You can't separate them.
And you can't get rid of the back
ache until you cure the kidney ache.
If the kidneys are well and strong,
the rest of the system is pretty sure
to be in vigorous health.
Doan's Kidney Pills make strong
healthy kidneys.
T. J. Seymour, 51 Pitt street, Jack
son, Cal. , says : ' ' Over twenty years
ago I was injured and at that time
my kidneys were affected. My back
grew weak and ached a great deal,
and the kidney secretions annoyed me
by their irregularity in passage. These
difficulties clung to me until I began
the use of Doan's Kidney Pills, pro
cured from the City Pharmacy. Since
taking this remedy, I have been free
from kidney complaint and have en
joyed much better health. In 1907 a
member of my family gave a public
statement, telling of my experience
and at this time. I am pleased to cor
roborate all that was then said in
praise of Doan's Kidney Pills."

For Supervisor.
L. H. Cook was down from the
mountains on Monday, and his card
for the republican nomination for
supervisor of district three appears in
this issue. He has been appointed by
the governor to fill the supervisorship
of that district between now and the
election, and is anxious to succeed
himself. His petition for appointment
was very generously signed, showing
that he is popular in his district. We
have no doubt he will make good as
supervisor between now and election,
and the people of that section will do
well to keep him in office for the en
suing term. He is a prominent busi
ness man of that township, possessing
good judgment and straightforward
in all his dealings.

Grand Ball
Largely Attended.
A grand ball was given at Love's
hall last Saturday night, under the
auspices of the Jackson Booster's
Club, and proved a complete succses.
The boosters are a crowd of Jackson's
younger people who are trying to de
velop stronger social relations be
tween Jackson and other towns sur
rounding the county seat. Many car
riages from Sutter Creek and Moke
lumne Hill were registered at the
livery stables, and quite a few came
up from lone. The music was fur
nished by Potter & Springer's or
chestra of Lodi, and the hall was filled
with dancers old and young.
Kept the King at Jjome
"For the past year we have kept tlie
king of all laxatives— Dr. King's New
Lire pills— in our home and they have
proved a blessing to all our family."
writes Paul Mathulka, of Buafflo. N. Y.
Easy, but sure remedy for all stomach,
liver and kindev troubles. Only 25
cents at Spaenoli's drug store.
A New Scheme
Two gold prospectors have completed
a plant along the Jackson creek on
property belonging to Harry Jones'
ranch, and started grinding up grass
roots and soil dug from the sides of
the creek, in an arastra consisting of
a cement basin, with a large revolv
ing wheel, to which is attached heavy
rucks. As the wheel revolves, the
rocks are drawn over the Boil which is
shoveled into arastra, thereby grind
ing it to a mush. A stream of water
continually runs into the basin, which
has an overflow that carries away
floating mass. The gold settles to the
bottom of the basin, and is cleaned up

about twice a week. The prospectors
are miners with a general knowledge
of the various chemical actions
through which the sulphurets pass, and
claim that with sulphurets, after an ex
posure to the elements of about 30
years, oxidation takes place, and the
free gold is deposited along the banks
of the creek, the tall grass acting as a
mat in keeping it from being washed
on down the stream. By panning the
earth along the stream, a large per
centage of gold is obtained in each
pan, and the prospectors are confident
their plant will net them a good profit
when it is gotten into steady running
order. A large water wheel is used to
operate the plant.
Good Shooting by
Captain Bartlett.
A shooting exhibition was held at
Zeila park directly after the ball game
Saturday last, and proved a very in
teresting exhibition. Captain's George
E. Bartlett, representing Peters Car
tridge Company of San Francisco,
did the shooting and proved himself
an elegant marksman as well as a
clever stock demonstrator.
The captain shot brick to pieces as
they were tossed into the air, put
holes through pieces of steel about 2
inches square and }£ inch thick, and a
large number of other remarkable
feats.
Bartlett was deputy United States
marshal many years ago, and as an
early frontiersman, he learned the art
of shooting that makes him popular to-
The steel targets which were punc
tured while in the air are on exhibi
tion at Vela & Piccardo sporting goods
store, Main street, Jackson.
Newman Mine
Showing Fine
The Newman mine, at West Point
owned by the Levaggi Estate Co., is
showing up in fine shape. The tunnel
that is being run into the mountain
will attain a depth from the surface of
about 800 feet, when the present
contract is finished. It Is the inten
tion of superintendent Esola to still
drive the tunnel further ahead. The
vein in the face of the tunnel is about
3 to 4 feet in width and showing good
indications of pay ore. The stopes of
this mine look fine, and are being
worked right along. There is about
500 tons of rock ready for the mill at
the mine, also about 80 tons of fine
high grade galena sulphureted ore
which the owners Intend to be sent to
the smelters. There is a fine 10
stamp battery mill on the mine which
will be kept running on the ore al
ready stoped for some months.—Citi

to remind me of the days gone by,

so often, that I really forget all I owe.

BASSO'S HARNESS SHOP
An old and tried harness man can
always be relied upon, and A. Basso
has both virtues, he has handled
leather more than 50 years, and many
of his first harnesses are still in use.
He does a general boot and shoe re
pairing trade, and once tried, always
patronized, seems to be his fortune.
My boots carry a pair of half soles
that he put on many months ago, and
I brought him over several other pairs
to-day for repairs.
E. MARRE BROS.
One of the best established whole
sale dealers and jobbers of imported
and domestic wines and cigars, is the
firm of E. Marre & Bros. Jackson.
The stock they don't carry is a class
that nobody wants, and the trade they
have is one secured by honest dealing,
and a supply of the best distilled
whiskies and brewed beers on the
market. They are progressive, oblig
ing and a valuable helps to Jackson's
progressiveness. I always go there
for the port wines that I send to my
sick cousin. They are recommended
hy the physician f<£j)Btrength, and I
feel satisfield that ' my wine is pure
when I buy it here.
CITY MEAT MARKET
I wanted to take some fresh meat
along home, so I stopped into the City
Meat Market, managed by George L.
Thomas & Co. We eat so much
smoked m^at that it becomes quite
tiresome and a nice juicy steak is
about as good a treat as I could care
to take along home. We sell all our
cattle to Thomas, and our stock re
ceives the best attention, as we have
them examined regular so as to pre
vent any chances of a sick cow or
steer. Thomas appreciates our fair
ness by giving us extra weight when
ever we come to town, but of course
don't you expect it. It would break
him, as the price of cattle is very high
this season.
GARBARINI BROS. LUMBER.
We had to send below for lumber,
because we did not know of any
lumber company before we subscribed
for the Ledger, but we are better in

Company carries a stock of lumber"
sufficient to build an average country
town. More than 300.000 feet of
lumber continually carried in stock,
and the manager, a young gentleman
named Steele, has his yards strictly in

The appropriation bill for the year
ending June 30, 1911, contains the fol
lowing clause in regard to the printing
of envelopes with the address of firms
or individual's name thereon, a prac

or bowel complaints has received such
general approval. The secret of the
success of Chamberlain's colic, cholera
and diarrhoea remedy is that it cures.
Sold by all dealers.
