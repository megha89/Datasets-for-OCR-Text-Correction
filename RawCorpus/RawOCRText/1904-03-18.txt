SICKROOM TACTICS.
A Successful ' Nurs c; Must Be Gentle,
Patient and Tactful. :
The proper mental atmosphere creat-,
ed In a sickroom is often as Important
as the remedies given. A nurse should
be In touch with her! patient— that Is,'
she should be sympathetic and not al
low Irritability and whims to upset her
equanimity. The nurse who can create'
an atmosphere of repose,* who' can" hu-.
mor ' without ' indulging- her patient \ In
all -/the idiosyncrasies \ of^ sick ; people,
has won half the battle. : An unsympa
thetic, Impatient nurse will do more to
hinder recovery than the lack of rem
edies. It Is not acts and words alone
that help or hinder; her very thoughts
are as potent as her "general conduct,
and the sensitive patient will be influ
enced for good or ill if the nurse were
dumb.' She should at all times main
tain a positive uplifting mental atti
tude and remember that the patient's
Irritability or melancholia is justified
by •■ her physical . condition and \s ■ not
perverseness." ■
Gentleness, patience and, ' above all,
tact are the requisites for good and in
telligent nursing,'!, and ■ the ' nurse who
lacks these qualities has Indeed missed
her calling. Patients have of ten failed
to improve simply because they did not
fancy their nurse. A nurse must be
likable and make herself liked, and It
takes only plain tact and a little ch>
cumspection to ingratiate herself with
the most uninteresting of patients.
THE GYPSIES.
Their Tribes Existed In ' Burope
From Immemorial Times.
Gypsies were found in England about
1514, according to ."A" Dyalogue of Sir
Thomas : More" (1529), but the exact
year of their arrival Is unknown. They
were present 'ln Scotland in, 1505, and
possibly' they ' were the ! "Saracens"
whose •. depredations ;■ In : that country
prior to 1460 are on record.
Batalllard and other authors believe
that ; gypsies existed In ', Europe .- from
Immemorial times, for they find no ac
count lof their : crossing - the i Bosporus,
and no record is known to exist of their
passage to England or Scotland." -
'■- They/ were better received In these
countries than In ' any | other, \ but sso
early as ■ 1531- an act was passed rev
quiring ; the Egyptians 'to quit ' the
realm under . pain . of death, a similar
edict being issued in Scotland In 1541
and at varying periods In most of the"
European states.
Transportation across the .; seas ; was
among the milder means adopted and
probably J was the cause of much fur
ther dispersion of | the j tribes, i ;Dndei'
Henry VIII. gypsies were shipped from
England to Norway or . France, and
from France, so recently as 1802, they
were deported to Africa.
UNTIMELY CHEERS.
The Misplaced Bnthnitlasni ot an Ei>
Corpse In Ireland.
, It was the rule In Ireland at one
time that after an execution t the body
should j hang j an hour, j but the " sheriff,'
■froni mistaken lenity, j would ' on some
occasions look away after. the prisoner
had been turned off, while . the friends
of the culprit would hold up their com
panion by the waistband of the trousers
■so that the rope would not press upon
his throat. •, > , '. ._ X - .
When t the J: hour "was j expired the
deceased | was ; put I fnto a cart," which
was driven at a gallop along the stony
road. ; The Jolting generally brought
the : prisoner . to. One \ such jj recovery
was so" complete that the resuscitated
man sat up In the coffin and gave three
cheers, ;
( One of his friends was so shocked at
this Indecent conduct that he hit the
ex-corpse on the head with his shlllalah
and finished him. The question then
arose whether the assailant could be
■ tried for murder,' but it was ruled that
no man could be successfully charged
•with the murder of a man who was al
ready dead in law.— Pearson's Weekly.
Are 'Women Really Stingy t
Are ; women . meaner . In giving than
men?;ilt cannot rightly be urged that
they are;' Women, after all," In buying
or In giving are commonly making use
of money that others . have earned.
They, have been trustees of other peo
ple's money fpr 2,000 years, and long
use ! has made them caref v) cf their

meannesses are nothing in comparison

Coast Line of the Philippines.
A geographical magazlue makes the
interesting statement that the Philip
pine Islands have a coast line double
that of the main part of „ the United
States." The measurement given is 11,
444 statute miles, while the total area
Is stated as 115,020 square miles, vln
thp Philippines there Is one mile of
coast line to every ten miles of "area; In
the United States the proportion is 1
to 655. It Is said that 3,000 islands and
islets can be counted on the charts.—

A MOUSE THAT "SINGS."
Hun Who Cansht It Says It Warbles
Like a Canary.
. Singing mice ; are rare, , but a corre-
Bpondent writes from Yorkshire asking
whether we can give him any, lnforma
tlou about a. specimen he captured... -
J He adds, "It has been warbling just
like a canary for the last month in our:
Workshop, 'and although' l have It in a
■»ge it still continues to sing." '■ ;•' ;■*
That mice do occasionally lyslng";: Is
undeniable. .* Some i observers , say : that
their.' "song" f Is ,' softer, ;: "sweeter | and
more delicate than that of the canary,
which one ; can believe quite, easily.
Others go so* far as Jo compare It to
that of a warbler or even a piping bull
finch.'! But the question as to why they
Uft up their voices in this tuneful man
ner still remains to be answered; , : -=-'--^
•r Three explanations have ■ been : sng
gested:';... .... ..;. o ; -'.. v -, *:-. ;,,. ■
i ; First— That all mice are potential vo
calists and can learn to sing, by imita
tion, from singiut? birds. ,,..'. '-'.', . i
" 'Second.— That many mice possess an
exceptional talent for mimicry, together
with a keen sense of the ludicrous.' '.',
| Third.— That some mice are subject
to • bronchitis and that i the . so ( called
is only the wheezing of rodents
which suffer from the distressing com
plaint ■ ;.-, '-
A certain amount of color Is given to
the last theory by the fact that a mouse
which was ' caught by/ the neck ! In a
wire trap not sufficiently strong to kill
tt "sang" while Its throat was under
compression, I but • never - again during
Its subsequent life as a captive.—Lon

JADE AS MEDICINE.
It Is Used In Various Ways For Many
Dlneases In China.
Everything In : Chin a. of any rarity
whatever is certain to .be dragged into
the pharmacopoeia of the Chinese physi
cian. Jade is no exception to the rule.
It may be swallowed as a powder or la
little pieces the size of hemp seed for
various j stomachic complaints. ' Even
pockniarks and scars may be obliterat
ed by being daily rubbed with a piece
of pure Jade. | It Is also considered to
be of a moist nature," and we readiof
an imperial favorite of the eighth cen
tury who was cured of excessive* thirst
by holding a fish shaped Jade in her
mouth. 'And so when the tomb of the
great. commander, Ts'ao Ts'ao, third
century, A. D., was opened 200 years
after his death, among the usual ob
jects found In such circumstances was
a large sliver bowl full of water. : That
the water had not dried jup ■ was ac
counted for by the presence in the bowl
of a Jade boy three feet In height.
Jade Is chiefly j from
K'un-lun,' or; Koulkuh,' 5 range,*' between
the desert of t Gobi .arid « Tibet; = from
Khpten orllchl in Yarkand, and from
Lan-tien, on the Beiurtagb, mountains,
still' farther .'to the west- In the- tenth
century, A. D.; the latter was actually
known : : ; as - the r Jade H hills ' i district,
though it does riot appear that any Jade
has ever been found there.— Professor
Herbert . A. Giles In Nineteenth . Cen
tury.".
St. Patrick's Purgatory.
Medlreval songs and \ legends, which
are rich in all sorts of mythical and
fantastical lore, locate the entranced
St Patrick's famous "purgatory" on
the Island of Lough Derg.-.lreland. The
opening itself was through a cave, the
existence of which was revealed to the
saint by Christ, who Informed the good
Patrick that any. one with the moral
courage to go down into the cavern
would be saved the pangs of the real
"purgatory" after death, Patrick built
a monastery at the entrance: of his
earthly . "purgatory" andt secured the
way to the pit by an Iron gate provid
ed with strong chains and locks of
peculiar and intricate: workmanship.
Lough Derg, next to Jerusalem, was
the most celebrated spot 011 earth dur
ing the middle ages. Thousands visited
"purgatory" every year, and the whole
island had. the appearance' of a popu-
Reversible Snakes In India.
A snake not often heard of , at least
in America, Is the liver colored snake
with two heads, or perhaps they should
be called mouths, though It, does not
have two mouths at the same time.
They are reversible mouths, occupying
the opposite end every six months. It
Pea with the tWQ ends crossed on each
other, as with folded hands. Every
six: mouths the change of the seasons
reverses the functions of the two ends,
the head becoming the tail and the tall
becoming the head. The mouth at one
end heals or closes up all but a small
opening, while the opposite end be
comes the mouth for the next six
months.
Breton Children.
The Breton children are pious, super
stitious, stolid, strong, patient and very
thorough. The girls 'iire intelligent and
interesting. They are the mainstays of
the family. A chlld»of ten undertakes
to superintend both household work
and the farm. .. The boys are more or
less stupid, handsome, j bronze faced
country urchins, j Bee culture seems to

FROST FAIRIES.
The Wonderful Design* That Wln-
don Panes Picture.
' . When the frost fairies' have a mate
rial ready for original design they often
produce in the hours of darkness most
exquisite, decorations. 1 > The~ window
panes are their drawing paper, and the
window frames serve as picture frames
on* those : particular occasions. ;"; There
are said to be no less than a thousand
forms of snow crystals,' every one of
them of the finest finish and of unim
peachable I symmetry. • Some are like
the patterns In honlton lace, while oth
ers are i elaborated .; with geometrical
patterns so complex that it is difficult
to analyze . them. ,' But ■on the window
panes the" frost j pictures are by Jno
means confined to what are "standard
patterns" In snowflakes, but show the
most various arid dainty schemes of
ornament Some are like starry flow
ers; set I with 5 stars in the center arid
with 'starry shoots and comets < flying
lntospace around them. Others take
the j shape of f leaves arranged in set
form by some human ' designers. \ The
endive pattern is among the most beau
tiful; the : curves and 1 "motive",.- being
often \ scarcely , distinguishable :. from
those in which a goldsmith of the days
of j Louis XV. I modeled } the /ormolu In

Jasper or crystal. Scale patterns, like
the scales of. fishes, with striated lines

Americans on Guard.
There is no record that any such or
der as "Put none but Americans on
guard" was issued :by Washington.
Those who quote it do not know, when
it was supposed to. have been issued.
But it is a fact that on April 30, 1777,
in an or^er issued, at Morrlstown, N. J..
for reorganizing the Improperly called
'.'Washington's bodyguard'. 1 he did say
that he thought that men having an in
terest In the country ; would be less
likely to prove traitors than foreigners.
The order continued, "You will, there
fore," send me none but Americana."
Washington directed that this prefer
ence for Americans should not be made
known, as he feared it might excite
the many foreigners In the army.—Ex

How a' Miser, Selected an Heir.
As like affects like, so it la with mi
sers, and gold will go where gold is.
This Is strikingly illustrated by the act
of a celebrated Greek, one Dlchoeus
Dichoems, a descendant of the Byzan
tine emperors. This man, by the exer
cise of extreme niggardliness, managed
to amass the sum Qf. 550,000, an Im
mense fortune . in these days. Then
came the question to whom should he
leave It. One day . a distant " relative
sent him a letter written upon a square
inch of paper. This was sufficient. In
the fitness of things. the parsimonious
correspondent became the miser's heir.

His Little Bill.
When Brander Matthews went to his

Bookman, he went to the letter \ box
and looked • through the compartment
marked "M" and found therein a very
peremptory dun from a • tailor. : Mr.
Matthews was puzzled, as he bad had
no ! dealings with -the Insistent tailor,
until he again looked at the envelope
and found \ that he \ had , unwittingly
opened a letter belonging to another
member of the club; so he put the bill
back in the envelope and returned it to
the compartment As Mr. Matthews
was turning to go he noticed the mem
ber for whom the : bill ■; was Intended
coming toward the letter box.. A min

room, where Mr., Matthews was sitting
with several others, .Taking from Its
envelope the bill, he read It attentively
for a few minutes, sighed, tore it into
bits, then, with a wink and the leer of
an Invincible conqueror, commented,
"Poor, silly little girl." ;' ;

Le«vca and Colors.
Bright colors assumed " by - maples!
sumacs and ampelopsls during the au
tumn months are the result of the oxi
dizing of the color compounds, or color
generators, of the leaf cells. Long pro
tracted cool weather is most favorable
to the production of autumn tints, and
slight frosts that are not severe enough
to kill the cells hasten the display of
beauty by producing an enzyme that
brings forth the bright purples, oranges
and. reds. Leaves containing much
tannlc add never give bright autumn
tints, while those containing sugar give
the very prettiest. .• .

THE SCIENCE OF A LIGHT.
Cheap Acetylene Gas Was DlseoVer-
Ed by an Accident.
Cheap commercial acetylene gas was
discovered by accident. , Willson, a sci
entific experimenter, 'believed that near
ly all metallic oxides could be reduced
to a metallic state by beating them to
an extremely high temperature by the
voltaic arc in the presence of free car
bon. Aluminium bad been successfully
reduced jln this : way. , Mr. \Willson
wished to obtain metallic calcium. He
j therefore mixed : a ; quantity;, of quick
lime with pulverized coke and brought
the mixture to a high temperature by
the action ' of the voltaic arc. ' He ex
pected to obtain a white metal, but in
stead he appeared to produce nothing
but slag. This was thrown into the
yard, and one day at noon while the
boys were having, their luncheon .they
picked up these bits of slag and threw
them at each other. , One piece fell into
a pall of water and, produced a bub
bling effect and a'strong odor/. This at
tracted Mr. .Willson's attention, and
upon investigation he found j that the
strong smelting gas was extremely in
flammable. Further Investigation re
vealed that it was pure acetylene gas.—

THE RAILROAD PROJECT.
Edward Records, the representa
tive of the American River Electric
Company, who is taking a leading
part in endeavoring to form a 'Com
pany to construct an electric rail
road from lone to Sutter Creek' and
Jackson, returned to this county last
week from a trip to San Francisco
with other promoters, and has been
interviewing the heavy shippers of
supplies for the purpose of getting a
five-year guarantee of all their
freight received at the lone depot
for the proposed extension to the
mining belt. • At first" blush this
may appear an entirely superfluous
proceeding. :It is conceded that all
present methods of hauling freight
to Jackson and Sutter Creek must
give way in the presence of a rail
road. Neither freight teams nor
traction engines can compete either
in price or rapidity^of transporta
tion with railroad facilities. Where
.Jkenjs the need of asking for guar
antees? Another change in the pro
gram is that the money to construct
the j road is expected to all come
from the outside. In other words,
bonds will be floated to pay the cost,
with some subscribed capital of
course to start the enterprise The
cost "of construction is now placed at
$150,000, which, whOe it is. a big
raise on the original- figures of $80,-,
000," is 'probably still' a Very con
servative estimate. The average
cost per mile of railroad is over $20,
000. An electric road is said to be
a cheaper proposition than a steam
road,'' and perhaps it can be bnilt for
something^ like $10,000 per. mile!
The only reason we can see for the
demand for freight guarantees is to
satisfy intending subscribers for. the
bonds. With a \ certain amount of
business guaranteed, it can be easily
figured out what the freight receipts
would foot up, and hence a clear
idea can be'obtained as to whether
the road would be a a paying propo
sition — a proposition that would
commend itself to investors suffici
ently'to induce them to take the
bonds. From this standpoint the
effort^ to secure signed contracts
covering a number of years from the
principal mining companies along
tb'emdther lode seems a reasonable
move. The promoters guaran
tee to land freight at the mines of
Jackson and Sutter Creek at not' to
exceed $2 per ton. This would be
about the maximum rate allowed for
railroad haulage, 15 cents per mile,
reckoning 14 miles road bed between
lone and Jackson. This may seem
a steep tariff, still it is a great im
provement upon .existing rates,
which are $4 for general freight, and
from $3 to $3.50 for large quantities.
As a rule, both companies and indi
viduals are reluctant to bind them
selves on such a proposition for , a
term of years, still it would be most
unfortunate for the project to fall
through for lack of promise of sup
port: « It is a dead certainty that the
road will command the business on
the tariff rate proposed, whether the
guarantees are signed or not. ■ But
if the contracts will help the scheme
along to a speedy realization, we ,do
hope the business will be pledged in
the manner required/ It -will hurt
noorieV'it will help the interests of
the community at large amazingly
to sign the contracts.
The Republican state committee'
adopted a resolution recommending '
that the state convention instruct
the delegates to the national con-i
vention in favor of Roosevelt "as the
standard bearer in the coming cam
paign'. '"While the committee in this
respect unquestionably voiced the
sentiment of the rank and file of the
party, not only in California, but
throughout the Union, still the wis
dom of establishing a precedent. of
that kind may be questioned. It is
not the province of a state or county
central committee to -. attempt ito
forestall the action of -a convention
in regard to party nominees. ij-JWhat
would be thought of our county com
mittee recommending the nomina
tion of this or that . candidate. We
would think it entirely out of place,
and a usurption ; of authority. Po
litical committees are merely bodies
to set the party machinery in mo
tion. They are not the whole thing,
indeed they are a very : small part of
the real thing, notwithstanding they
wax dictatorial at times, and prance
around as if the party was made for
some of its members, instead of the
committee being the mere creature
of the party in convention assem
bled. The Ledger believes in keep
ing strictly within delegated author
ity. The republicans of California
are practically solid for Roosevelt.
It is improbable that any other name
will be mentioned in connection with
the presidential nomination. And
whether W. R. Hearst or a straight
out democrat be his opponent, he"
will be swept into the -presidential
office to succeed himself by one of
the largest majorities ever given in
a national con tesv
perhaps the most..pernicious,sys
tem introduced by^the unions is f the
practice of publishing a list of so;
called scabs— inenTwho "are deemed
traitors| to the cause ofl organized
labor because they "do notTsee their
way clear to do just what the labor
organizations want them to do.
How the unions can defend this
practice, and at the same time de
nounce the keeping of a
by the employers, is something that
baffles oor comprehension. We are
continually greeted with the appear
ance in print— a thing unknown in
history of employers in relation to
tabooed men— of a list of names
sometimes accompanied by the | por
traits of the ■ individuals under ' the
labor ban:— Occasionally - such 'pla
cards are posted, in"*. conspicuous
places, being"> scattered
broadcast 1 - through the! mails. £ t,lf
such cond uct does _ not fall with i n
the scope of the libel law, it is about
time a law to that effect was passed.'
Why such papers ; containing such
assaults upon private character— a
palpable attempt !to abridge indi
vidual liberty guaranteed by the con
stitution — are allowed the • privilege
of the liberal postal laws. is incom
prehensible. Every man— and every
organization of men— has the right
to the , free expression' of opinion.
No reasonable man will dispute this.
But when instead of a mere ex
pression of opinion an , individual's
right to earn a living is directly as
sailed, and a man is held up to ridi
cule and ostracism, because, for
sooth, he wants to boss his own
labor according to his own con
science, it seems to us such tactics
are not of the kind to • carry weight
with enlightened American citizens.
We cannot believe that one .tithe of
the members of labor 'organizations
approve ; of such , methods. As a
rule, they are reasonable and intelli
gent men, and must sincerely de
plore this drift to extreme measures,
which cannot be otherwise than
prejudicial the* cause; of - union

MORE VERDANT LEGISLATION.
It was decided to petition the board
of supervisors to pass an ordinance pro
hibiting any one-person from having in
his possession more than 100 trout at
any one time. This is purposed to de
feat the malpractice of those who go
to the lakes in the mountains during
the summer months, catch several hun
dred trout and bring, them to lov.er
altitudes only to ' spoil before any use
can be - made thereof. The ' petition
will be circulated immediately, and
presented to the supervisors at the
next regular meeting. It is a good
proposition and should be universally
endorsed. —Record.
The above is taken. from the report
of the proceedings of the Sutter Creek
Game Protection Association at a meet
ing held last week, Let us hope the
supervisors will fight shy . of cumber
ing the ordinance book with any more
fool laws along the lines proposed.'- We
have a law now that prohibits the sell
ing of. trout or game birds,, or the
catching or killing of . the same for
market. Where the benefit of such an
ordinance comes in it is difficult to con
ceive. It is evaded— and very properly
and righteously evaded— by parties
catching fish for market, giving the
same away .on reaching the market
towns, and accepting a donation of half
a dollar or a dollar, according to the
number of fish donated, . which . money
is to help defray the expenses of the
fishing expedition. And why should
not an absurd law be bunkoed In this
fashion? Why should every lover of
trout have to take a tour to the lakes
or the creeks of the eastern part of the
county to gratify his appetite? Why
should he not have the privilege of
paying others for the trouble and ex
pense of fishing, in lieu of taking a trip
to the hunting grounds himself? The
proposed law will have no tendency
whatever to stop the spoiling of fish.
It is far better to try to bring trout to
the towns, where they sell readily for
cash, than to leave them to rot in the
neighborhood where they are caught.
Suppose such an ordinance is I passed,
what is to prevent a trout catcher from
throwing away his catch before it
reaches the 100 mark, and starting in
afresh; We have too many ill-digested,
indefensible attempts at legislation of
this nature already. J There never has
been, and it is doubtful if there ever
will be, a conviction under them. They
seem to be designed to stake around
the lakes and rivulets of the upper sec
tion with impracticable ordinances for
the purpose of securing the fishing
grounds for the pleasure of the sport
ing aristocracy. Our beautiful deer
law is designed along the same lines.
It makes it unlawful to have deer meat
in one's possession during that portion
of the year when climatic conditions
shut out the sporting fraternity from
the valley from hunting in the deer
haunts of the mountains. The resi

RICHEY.
Richey, March 16.
The high wind last week did con
siderable damage .to old buildings
throughout : . Jackson valley and the
surrounding foothills. The big shed
on the Cronin place, better known as
the old Thompson place, ; is reported
totally demolished. Barns, roofs,
chicken , houses, etc.. were ; damaged.
Many a huge old tree that had with
stood the storms of generations went
down.- ■■■^i:<\ir--: ..- ■
\On the J. Q. Horton place,' about
three miles from Richey, a hay shed
was blown down, and a big old crab
apple tree also went over.
All around people are busy fencing.
Mr. Sohn has just finished putting up
a handsome wire garden fence. W.
H. Nichols Is at work on his field
fences. F. A. Horton j has . put a nice
fence of wire netting around his house
yard, and set out trees and shrubs. . J.
Q. and B. F. Horton have fenced their
garden, and have the fencing ready to
inclose their house yard when the
weather permits'. Adrian Fredericks,
the fruit grower, has also been fencing.
R. E. Horton has put up new poultry
fences, and set out quite a number of
fruit and ornamental trees and shrubs,
and has also put up considerable field
fencing.
Mr. Ringer, who owns extensive
pastures in the Camp Opra district,
has had new posts put in on both sides
of the road wherever needed, and an
other barb wire put on, greatly im
proving the looks of the property. ■-:.-_: .-_
At the home of ! Oscar Myers we
noticed a new yard fence. ■
Everywhere we went we uotlced per

t< B. C. O'Neill and Peter Podesta have
purchased the Enterprise livery stable
business, \ with ; the entire outfit of
horses, vehicles and harness, ! , from C:
M. Kelley, ' who has successfully . con
ducted the business for , a • number of
years. , . The price . paid, t we , are told,
was $4500. The transaction was. con
summated last Wednesday, and tie
new proprietors took possession that
evening. Podesta is thoroughly posted
in all matters pertaining to horses.
His long experience in the freighting
business as a partner of A. Piccardo
makes him peculiarly fitted for. the
livery business.* ■. His partner, . Barney
O'Neill, is also a man of j business | ex
perience, and well qualified to perform
the duties of his new . venture. The
firm is a strong one, and will undoubt
edly command a fair sharo of public
patronage. The newly formed partner
ship had spoken for the Brown build
ing at the . north, end r of Main street,
with the intention of starting a stable
there in case they, failed to agree upon
terms of- purchase of- the Enterprise,
stable. But the negotiations turned
out perfectly satisfactory all round.
The real property, consisting of the lot
and brick building, has also been-bar
gained for in thie interest of; ; the 'new
proprietors. The delay in the delivery
of the deed is owing to the . straighten
ing out of some matters in connection
with the title, j When . these are at
tended to the new firm will be virtually
in possession of both the reality, and
the business connected therewith.

PARAMOUNT is one of the handsomest

the very best.' Those who raise colts by this
beautiful young horse can consider themselves
fortunate. A tougher, more hardy, or better
formed horse never lived. His sire "Old Alta-
mont" was the greatest sire of extreme speed
in his day, having seven in the 2:10 list. There
are but two or three of his sons in the State,

LETTER FROM ALASKA
Alaska] Jan. 4, 1904. X
Editor Ledger: — /;^..,^\ JSJ. <
, In_many respecU life in the north is
more like a stupendous* dream than, a
living reality. ; About the 20th i of i No
vember the sun peeped over the lulls
south of Rampart at noon, but has
never shown its face here since, al
though the hills* across the river glisten
in' its ' heatlesa light' for " a . few ' hours
each mid-day. Business goes on about
as usual! \ Small sleds drawn by from
one to eight dogs, or larger^ ones with
one or two S horses attached, are , con
stantly coming from the creeks empty,
or' -going ""out loaded with supplies.
Sometimes a man is seen hauling two
or, three ] hundred -pounds on a sled
without any. dogs.. Women and chil
dren who live on the creeks often come
to town on i dog sleds when ; the tem
perature is 30° below zero. I often see
children playing out of doors with only
the eyes visible through the fur wrap
pings."' Two Xmas ' trees f were made
here." ' One was for the Indians, in " the
Episcopal Mission, the other for "the
white people, in the court house. They
were covered with festoons of pop corn,
and hung with the usual crop of bags
'of nuts and ' cand ies and : more costly
gifts. It was surprising to sea the in •
terest taken by some of the grizzled
miners, who had i seen nothing of the
sort for many yoars. Xmas night the
new hall of the "Arctic Brotherhood"
was dedicated with speeches, music, a
play, C "The. Three Hats, J1 and a
"grand" ball.- where twelve of the
young ladies wore white costumes and
five gentlemen wore full dress suits,
although cut-a-ways were the role, and
a few who wore moccasins or felt shoes
were not considered out of place/ The
music : was : violins and piano. The
leader formerly played in a San Fran
cisco orchestra, while the : pianist , was
a graduate of the Boston Conservatory
of Music. Such a mixture as a frontier
assembly shows could be found no
where else.' 1 ' ;,■•-■
The miners are in good spirits, and
expect a large clean-up ' in the spring.
The pay dirt is found from 10 to 25 feet
from the surface. .A shaft is sunk : to
bedrock, and drifts run along the pay
streak . . Some use steam to ■ thaw the
dirt; while ] others pile wood against
the face of the drift and * set it on fire
at night, and in the morning, the "dirt
is thawed to the depth' of 12 to 18
inches. This is shoveled into a loose
pile and hoisted to the top -during the
day." In the ; summer, when water ; is
plenty, the dumps, as the piles of pay
dirt are . called, : are washed. ' Several
hydraulic plants are being put in place
this winter,' but many of the old-time
miners consider them a doubtful ex
periment. If they are successful, Ram
part will be a good town , for many
years, for this whole region abounds in
gold-bearing dirt. C..H. G.

SHENANDOAH VALLEY.
Shenandoah Valley, March 16.
. Thestorm king, who for more than
a month has held revel here, has yet
neither abdicted nor been deposed.
The farmers are growing exceedingly
weary of the enforced idleness entailed
by the weather's playful habit of giving
them shower baths every day. Grain
and grass are making a growth little
short of marvelous, and even the stock
that are turned out to shirt for them :
selves are able to pick up a good living
along the roadsides. As the grass
grows high the price of hay will prob
ably come down from its extreme alti
tude, though' few here need to buy,
and no one has any more to sell. The
high water prices on farm J products
reached the last year, will doubtless
encourage .the production of these
staples. . ' .
The heaviest windstorm of the sea
son came last . Thursday. The usual
pranks, of fences blown down and
branches twisted from trees were in
dulged in, and in addition the roof was
carried entirely off C. H. Courrier's
barn, and a huge oak near the house of
Robert Brown, sr., was blown down,
nearly taking in its fall the home its
branches had sheltered so long. A
small building used as a storeroom,
only a few feet from the dwelling, was
entirely demolished.
G. L. Toney had a fine mule drowned
in the Cosumnes river one day last
week. He was crossing the ford be
tween Diamond Springs and Nashville
with a team of twelve animals. In
some way six of them became tangled
and went under water, and for a time
it seemed that they would all be lost.
They were cut loose from the load and
hauled to land more dead than alive,
but with one exception were revived.
In view of what might have been, Mr.
Toney was fortunate in escaping a
much severer loss.
Mrs. Sarah Frey of Hungerfords
Mills, has been visiting her grand
mother, Mrs. Satchwell, of the valley.
A party was given at the home of J.
J. Davis last Saturday evening. The
time was pleasantly spent In playing
games and . discussing a lunch which
was served about midnight, It was
nearly three o'clock before the revellers
thought of home, and your correspond
ent dare not suggest the hour at which
they were willing to arise In the morn

Do You Want Strength!
If you want to increase your strength
you must add to and not take from the
physical. In other words, the food that
you eat must be digested, assimilated
and appropriated by the nerves, blood
and tissues, before being expelled from
the intestines. Kodol Dyspepsia Cure
adds to the physical. It gives strength
to and builds up strength in the human
system. It is pleasant to the taste and
palatable, and the only combination of
digestants that will digest the food and
enable the system to appropriate all of
its health and strength-giving qualities.

Fell Two Thousand Feet.
;An awful tragedy happened at the
Gwin ; mine Wednesday afternoon,
whereby Charles ' Levinsky, the skip
tender,', was: plunged headlong to his
death. It appears he was being hauled
out .' of ; the shaft in the empty skip.*
The skip, as usual, was hoisted "above
the collar of the shaft, -and was being
lowered to enable the -man to get off.
At this moment something got wrong
with the machinery, the engineer being
unable to stop the skip. It is a per
pendicular ' shaft, and skip and its
human freight went down like a flash,
all the efforts of the engineer to stop
Us downward career proved unavailing.
It fell to the sump, a distance of. 2000
feet. ■ The cable unwound from the
reel, and went down the shaft with the
skip. Of course, Levinsky 's life went
out before the downward . journey was
finished. .'• One would Imagine ' that he
was mangled beyond recognition. ! But
this was not so, although scarcely , an
unbrokfo bono remained. When found
his hands clasped the rope in a death
grip,, and the imprint of the cable
was left upon the flesh. The Victim
was a young : man 21 years of age,
born and ' raised in Calaveras county.
He .was a member of the Paloma
miners' union, under the auspices of
which organization the funeral will be
conducted to-day.
The New Church Project.
The Rev. J. W. Phelps Is , meeting
with gratifying success in bis efforts to
remodel the M. E. church, and move it
to its proper place. Subscriptions are
coming in liberally. At present the
amount subscribed and on hand foots
up over $2000. These are all considered
perfectly srood. As the estimated ' cost
of the proposed building is $2500,' the
trustees feel justified in calling for bids
and letting the contract at once.- The
people are taking hold of the- proposl
tjon in downright earnest. It is rea
lized that the movement is needed, and
although some may be disposed to
cavil, this only serves to make the true
friends of the church all the more de
termined to push the project to a
speedy consummation. There is scarce
ly any doubt that the new M. E. church
will become an accomplished fact this
summer, and it is fully expected that
when the opening day comes, it will be
entirely free from debt.
St. Patrick Entertainment.
The entertainment given . in Love's
hall last night, in behalf of St. Patrick's
church, was a grand success in every
way. The annual celebration of the
day in Jackson for the benefit of the
church is invariably a success, but this
year the outcome was unusually grati
fying. The night was stormy, and
many were kept away from this cause.
Nevertheless the hall • was packed to
the doors. \ The reserved seats, num
bering over 200, were all taken. The
drama presented was entitled "Because
I Love You," in four acts. All the
characters ' ' were sustained by local
amateurs. They have been practicing
for weeks, and their acting displayed
not only thorough preparation and
careful training, but histrionic ability
of no mean order. It would be out of
place to particularize. The characters
were taken as follows:
Imogene Courtleigh— Wilful, wayward and
wealthy.. Mrs. G. L. Thomas
Ginger— A gypsy waif. . ..Mtss Loretta Meehan
Nance Tyson— Her supposed mother
_"y'-"if-i Mrs. Mary Freeman
Prudence Freeheart— A poor relation.
Miss Emma Boarman
Horace Verner— An artist, and accidentally a
married man James B. Dye
Dine Potts— His chum, and Incidentally in .

, Yorker Will Penry
Major Duffy — County Clerk and confederate
veteran Geo Luse
Squire Ripley— A Virginian landlord
?. •".<; Ben F.Gilbert
Lige— A gentleman of color Phil Roberts
A dance followed the regular enter
tainment, which was also largely at
tended, the whirl of pleasure being
kept up till 4 o'clock a. m. The re
ceipts of the entertainment are not
known at present, but a very sub
stantial balance for the church will re
main after paying expenses.

Jackson tongues have been agog the
past week discussing the anonymous
scandalous letter deposited in the post
office and addressed to a resident of the
town. The communication is having
just the opposite effect to what the
writer ' intended. Sending anonymous
communications with malicious intent is
a species of annoyance condemned by
all right-minded people. A determined
effort will no doubt be made to find out
the author of this outrage.

Conditions Healthy.
There. are v fully 600 men employed
about the mines and mills of the" four
mines within a range of two miles. of
Jackson— namely the ' Kennedy;"* Zeila,
Oneida and 'Argonaut ■ mines. This ' is
the largest number of men employed in
mining operations in the history of this
camp during the era of quartz • mining.
The money paid out monthly ' to ; sup
port this army of workers and supplies
must „* approximate \ from $76,000 to
$100,000 monthly. Reckoning the pop
ulation of Jackson at 2500, thU \ would
make $30 per'month \ for every man,
woman and child, or 81 per day,; per
capita from the mining industry alone.
True, this Is the principal source of in
come,'but it is not . the only source.
The salaries paid out for, county and
township officers and for other services
will easily swell the per capita to from
10 to 20 cente additional. This' money
is paid out as regularly - as clockwork.
Few towns of the size of Jackson can
make such a'• showing. It ought to
make the county Beat of Amador one of
the most thriving and ; prosperous
towns. in the state. Asa matter of
fact, it is a town of bustle and i thrift.
It will 'compare with almost any town
of its size in the state. No matter how
thrifty -a} town -may be, there "win
always go up from some quarters a cry
of hard times. So it is here. We hear
complaints that business is • dull; ; that
money Is" scarce, and hard to collect;
that wage-earners are not disposed to
spend as freely as in the past.. But
after all, It Is doubtless true that ■ more
money is being circulated In Jackson at
the present time, than at any . previous
period. Business, houses have increased
in number perhaps in a greater; ratio
than the wage -earners: So that while
more business is done than heretofore,
the average percentage for "each busi
ness man . may .- show ■■ a ' decline. ; .This
may explain the complaint ■ from > some
old established . business places that
times are duller than , heretofore. But
as a matter of fact Jackson is doing
fairly well,' all kickers to" the "contrary
notwithstanding. ' And the outlook is
encouraging for, brighter • and livelier
times ahead. '

GOLD MINING IN
AMADOR COUNTY
Central Eureka Steadily Improving
as a Dividend Payer.— The Oneida
: Continues in a Prosperous Condition.
, Central Eureka.— This mtherJthe
most steady and liberal dividend payer
In the county at the present time,"'con
tinues to make a very flattering show-
Ing.' The last dividend declared .was
at . the ' fate of five cents . per . share.
Heretofore ";" the ."dividends'; paid have
been two cents ■ per shared" There are
400,000 shares in" the' company , W 6O* the
increased dividend aggregated : $20,000.
The liberal "payment,* it is .understood,
was not all earned during the previous
month, but the com imny wore in a
position to pay the increase by re
ducing the treasury surplus to
some extent. It is reported that here
after dividends will be paid at the . rate
of 2} per cent; This 'shows the prop
erty to be in. 'a .very prosperous con
dition.' In I the ' last sinking; below the
2100 level a fine ore body was encoun
tered.'
Oneida.— The full . sixty stamps .of
the mill are now in steady- operation.
The mine Is looking better than at any
time since' it was' reopened by the pres
ent 'company. -While tho ore is not
high grade, . except ': in - spots, ' taken
altogether the rock is of. paying quali
ty, and leaves a fair margin of profit.
The property is among the closest) and
most economically managed of < the big
mines of Amador county, and .to this
fact is mainly due the present satis
factory outlook of the mine. The his
tory of the Oneida, under- its present,
as well , as its^. previous • owners, * Illus
trates the vicessitudes of mining:, oven
along the ' main gold' bearing lode of
Amador county. . For a time the .60
stamp mill was kept in motion, at the
outset, without much attention being
paid to selecting the ore. But it did
not "pay. The poor rock; so' reduced
the . yield 'that - the pay; ore was in
sufficient: to bring, the'; average to a
remunerative basis. - So twenty stamps
were kept; running, ' on selected ore,
with the" result that the,, improved out
put per ton was very marked, and' the
property advanced to a self-sustaining
basis.. Rich spots in the ledge were en
countered, and the milling ore increased
in quantity until now the prospects are
bright for a .' steady _, career as ' a divi
dend payer..' Only a~ strong -company,
such as the one now in control, , would
have been able financially to persist in
the face of discouragements that, for; a
time ; existed:,. ;The history fof! the
Oneida is . but a repetition - of the ' ex
perience of nearly every big mine along
the lode. ' Every one has met with bar
ren and fruitful years. But persistence
in * development work ' has almost ,' in
variably been rewarded with a liberal
yield of precious metal.'
Gwin.— The mill is operating with
90 stamps, the largest number that has
been in operation for a fong.time^l ! The
prospects have much improved of late,
and the return of the era. of dividends
is confidently : looked for in; the fnear
future.- !
Bunker Hill.— The output of the
first month's ■ run "of the new', twenty
stamp mill which was started the mid
dle of February Is awaited with much
interest, not only by the stockholders
but also by the people generally, as the
launching of another steady producer
means much for the county at large.
The ledge has been opened at three
levels— Boo/ 1200 and 1400 feet. Rock
from the .-1 200 level has supplied the
mill. . This ore Is reported to be of
medium grade . compared with . the
other levels. From the appearance of
the plates and the quantity of quick
silver fed millmen \ are i able to give a
a fairly correct guess of the pay char
acter of the ore. Judging from these
indications an average yield of $5 or S6
in free gold Is looked for. The con
centrates saved are roughly estimated
at 1} tons per day, valued at $70 to $80
per ton. These are claimed to be very
conservative figures, and serve to show
the confidence of the parties in interest
In the Bunker Hill property. ■

Jackson Creek Cuts a New Channel.
We are Informed by residents of
Jackson valley that during the period
of high water, in. the freshet of two
weeks ago, Jackson creek cut out a
new channel for itself, at a point about
a quarter of a mile before reaching the
new bridge constructed last season
near Buena Vista. - The new-made
water way leaves the bridge nearly a
quarter of a mile from the main water
way newly . created. Some water -. is
flowing in the old creek bed under the
bridge, but most of the water ' pursues
the new channel. The cause of this
shifting was not owing to any " faulty
construction of the approaches to the
bridge, but rather to the accumula
tion of sand and the growing willows
and shrubbery along the banks of the
stream. The new creek makes a junc
tion with the old channel at a point
about a quarter of a mile below the
bridge. .To keep Jackson creek per
manently within Its old banks will in
volve considerable expense.

<A; movement b ' on"- foot : to -*secure 7 a
new public burying ground for /Jack*

for many years? The interments which
have been conducted here for* yean
have been simply from sufferance. The
old burying ground has been -. used be
cause there was no other provision for
Interments. It Is Intended ' to ' form a
cemetery association* J with' sufficient
capital to purchase and plat out a new
graveyard, - within . easy | distance : *6f
town, but beyond the town limits^ One
or two tracts are In^.vlew.'V .The' '<'. com
pany will be duly incorporated, as soon
as the necessary capital Is subscribed.
It Is hoped to secure enough ground to
allow the different 'orders to' get sep^
arate plaU, also family plats at reason
able' figures, 1 1 arid \ have a .responsible
man to look after -the ' grounds. "The
movement Is not a selfish or mercenary
one. From a financial standpoint, the
investors do not hope to receive at the
utmost more than a ' small ' interest on
the capital/: Indeed . It Is not \ known
whether the : capital v required 'will ' be
forthcoming. *If .'any one 'wishes to

stock, his aid will be gladly welcomed.

Plum rwdlnar «s Food.
■ In : : popular : belief » plum pudding,
though difficult of digestion, I contains
a large proportion of nutriment The
London Lancet publishes the analysis
made of^two puddings,: of which; one
was found to have a "nutrient value"
of 08 per cent and the other of 50.
: It appears that, although most agree
able as an article of. food, plum pud
ding is not : quite . so concentrated a
form of diet as has been supposed, and
conjectures that it yields as much sus
tenance as beefsteak are certainly, not
supported -by? Its 'chemical <; composi
tion. . The amount of nitrogenous mat
ter is only moderate, and it must be re
membered that In calculating! the nu
trient ratio and value all 'the nitrogen
has been \ assumed Ito \be i'j albuminoid.
Probably I the ; true | album! nold s ; and
consequently v the food jalue are slight
ly lower_ than would appear from the
results; -also the percentage of -, water
is . rather ) larger and' the 'quantities "of
the remaining components are propor

An Important Announcement.
I . When the late Lord Lyons was Brit
ish ambassador at Paris he received a
\ gift of two , emus.'". Embassies are" not
'exactly - the place to keep such ■ birds,
'and he gave them to the Duke of Nor
jfolk, who then had a large aviary at
'Arundel castle. The duke in his turn
named the pair Lord and Lady Lyons.
Like all amateur bird fanciers, be was
eager to. raise a brood of little emus,
but the birds showed no disposition to
propagate .; their J species. : The duke
'finally grew weary of ' watching them
and left it to the keepers to bring him
immediate j word { of I any signs ' of a
family. ■ A month : or two ; later ; when
the household was at lunch with sev
eral guests one of the keepers insisted
upon access to the duke. " Red, breath
less and stammering, he burst into the
dining room with ."Your grace, ' your
grace, Lord and Lady Lyons ,'aye laid
ahegg!'! . , ' i. ;
Brltlsb "Local Nicknames.
The residents of the English counties
have. nicknames. the meaning and ori
gin of which" are not always obvious.
Why the \ inhabitants of *,' Liverpool
should be called "Dicky Sams". Is not
very clear. . But nearly all the counties
have their distinctive nicknames. ' The
Glaswegians are "Keelies," the Lan
cashire men are Bobbins," while
the Lincolnshire 'folk have long been
called "Yellow Bellies," after the frops
which once abounded there. Yorkshire
men, again, are everywhere "Tykes," a
nickname the etymology of which. is
not easy to trace. -.The Inhabitants of
Suffolk are designated "Dumplings,'i
those of Keut "Hogs" and the Isle of
Wight people "Calves."
The Fretful Porcupine.
. . In - the . woods of Keewaydln there
once roamed a very discontented por :
cupine. He was forever fretting.- \He
complained that everything was wrong. 1
till ■ it [was perfectly -scandalous, and
the Great Spirit, getting tired of his
grumbling, said:
"You ' and' the world I have made
don't " seem ito flt. : One or the other
must be wrong. It is easier to change
you. You don't' like the trees, you are
unhappy on the ground and think ev
erything is upside down, so I'll turn you
inside out and put you in the water." .. :
This was - the origin of the shad.—,

Wellington's judgments of men and
history are singularly Just and correct:'
He used few words and never fenced
his meaning about with qualifications.
When Lord EJlesmere mentioned a cer-_
tain writer's low opinion of Napoleon
the duke replied: "Napoleon was the

and with French troops. I confine my
self to that % His policy was mere bully

TRAFFIC IN SLAVES.

the Marrakesh ; Market.
In, his article on "The Slave Market
at Marrakesh" In Harper's Magazine
S. L."^ Bensusan gives a vivid picture of
this terrible traffic,' which goes on* ap
proved by the Moroccan government.
He describes the beginning of the sale
asfollows:" V - '
."The 'crowd at the entrance parts to
the I right \ and left . to admit \ twelve
grave men wearing white turbans and
Jellabias. / They are the delals, or auc
tioneers, and the sale is about to begin.
: - "Slowly and impressively the delals
advance in a line to the center of the
slave market, ' almost up to the arcade
where t the S wealthy ; buyers -• sit ex
pectant , Then .the head .auctioneer
lifts .up I his 'voice,*; and— oh, | hideous
mockery of it alU'-rhe prays. : V
"'; "Now. each delal has his people sort
ed out, and the procession begins.' Fol
lowed iby ; his I bargains, " he : marches
round and round the market, and I un
derstand . why .: the | dust | was laid | be^
fore the procession commenced." Some
of the slaves are absolutely ; free from
emotion of any sort. ~ They move round
as j stolidly as -the blindfolded . horses
that work the water wheels in gardens
beyond , the town. '.';'_'-. Others feel their
position.
.. " ".Twenty -one - dollars— twenty -onef
cries the delal at whose heels the one
young and pretty woman who has not
found a buyer limps painfully; She is
from the western Sudan, " and her big
eyes have the terror stricken look that
reminds jme of a hare that was run
down by the hounds a few yards from
me on the ] marshes ■ near my . country
home last winter. ■' :.

he was but four years old, and his de
light at the present knew no bounds.'-';
."My father wanted me to be a minis
ter," said he in telling the story many
years after, "and I thought I must do
as he wished. But when I was eight
years old he bought me . a new j violin
and arranged to have me study under
a I teacher, .'for,' he ' said, 'a minister
ought to ; know a - little about j music'
That night I could not sleep. '■ ' I rose
in the night to get a peep at the pre
cious violin. . It was so red, and the
pretty pearl screws did smile at me so!
I pinched the strings Just a little with
my fingers, and it smiled at me more
and ; more. I . took iup \ the bow and
looked at It It said to me it would be
pleased . to have me try It across j the
strings.' So I did try it Just a very,
very little, and it did play so softly."' I
forgot that It was midnight and every
body asleep, and the next minute I felt
my father's whip my shoulders.
My little red violin dropped on the floor
and was broken. ■ I did weep very much
for it, but it did no good. They did
have a doctor to it the next day,' but it
never recovered its health." — Detrott

"Wanted— Some French books which
a young girl may safely read ' and
which will fit into a small ' bookcase.
The. height of each book must not ex
ceed ten inches. The price is of no im
portance, provided all the books j havr

.;■;■• The ; moat encouraging ; out <of 'door
subjects for. the beginner in photogra
phy are landscapes. The most Impor
tant ; point : In ; photographing a-" land
scape is the selection of it; the choos
ing of a bit of scenery ; which,' when
translated ito black and \ white, j will
form an interesting picture. - You must
always bear in mind that the beautiful
colors j which { you ' see iln [ nature | and
upon the ground glass will not be pres
ent lin =;the photograph, .which j must
rely for its beauty upon form and light
and shade.' ; ; , When you wish to photo
graph a landscape, take plenty of time
to I think '-■ about ' It* '"After ; '"you t hay«
■ chosen ■> -your subject,^ determine J the
point of greatest Interest and then de^
cide whether the picture will look best
with this point directly in the . center,
to one side or toward the top or bot
tom.-.:; StS^^^^^^^
:*.lf you live near the spot you intend
to photograph, it will pay you to notice
at what time of year it is most beautl
,ful. s jSome landscapes look very com
monplace in ' summer, - but make j stun
ning pictures when; half j buried In the
snow.'"; Waterfalls .of ten"; lbok" ; best J In
early, spring; because there is a greater
« volume of water pouring over them at
that time than at any other. '.'";
"c A; most 1 interesting series of pictures
may be made by. choosing ' a] beautiful
bit of landscape and. photographing it
from the same point at frequent inter
vals % throughout \ the . year! % ' The first
picture, 1 we will say, Is taken" when the
ground J and ".trees . areTcoyered 'I with
snow, 1 the ' second when *■ most \of ■; the
snow . Is ; melted and * the " rest • lies -in
■ patches ; here and there and the . third
when the fields are flooded with rains.
After these would come pictures show
ing the trees in bud, in leaf, in blossom,'

WHITE HOUSE STABLES.
The . First ; of Them 'Was Destroyed
br.; the British Troops.
''.The original .White House stable was
located about sixty yards south of 'the
White House,- in , which 'are ' now ;the
private grounds of the executive man
sion, and was the first thing destroyed
when the ; British : capturedthe White
House* during the war of 1812." Presi
dents ; Monroe -and Adams kept . their
horses ; at Ia ■ livery : stable, i and | when
General ; Jackson ) came -to "the ; White
House he had a stable built at a point
some d istance . ; from ■ the . presidential
mansion.' This stable was also used for
a j time by : President Van : Buren,'; but
later he boarded his horses at a livery
stable. -<i>^ .Ur'vy'.; :•■•■. ,> : '. : .' ■'.-; ". >_..
I j President Pierce kept his horses in a
stable which was erected in the, White
House grounds at a point comparative
ly but a- short distance from the man
sion itself . I When President Buchanan
came to the .White House he. had, the
stable . enlarged,' and •it was / again ; en
larged for President Lincoln, who kept
a ' large' number of ; horses. :fX President
Johnson " also made use . of this ' stable
for , his horses and carriages/ * Up" to
Lincoln's time , there , was ; no water In
the I stable, ; save • . the \ limited ' supply
obtained from a small well, and it was
customary ' to : take .the , White House
horses to the Potomac river, fully half
a mile distant, in order that they might
be, watered, and frequently the White
House carriages were taken thither to
be washed.— Outdoor Sport.'
A Senatorial Tilt.
j . Senator Reagan . of ; Texas .when ' he
was in the senate was one of the men
who strongly objected to being inter
rupted.- . On one occasion * Henry W.»
Blair, then a senator from New Hamp
shire, tried Ito \ ask Reagan a question
during ,the latter's \ speech. \"1 , do not
want to be Interrupted," said Reagan,
"but I will listen to a question." j j
V "It is not 'exactly a question/: but a
statement," said Blair. _" . 7
i "Then I refuse to yield," " said Rea
gan. :: - : ;
"Well, the senator has missed an op
portunity \of greatly improving hla
speech," remarked Blair as he ambledi
toward the cloakroom.
A Bad Time to Confess.
"Here," . according to the Warrens
burg (Mo.) ■ Journal-Democrat, "is the
way a Benton county man confessed at
a revival: He had been pressed to re
pent and finally got up and said, 'Dear
Mends, I feel the spirit moving in me
to talk and tell what a bad man I have
been/but I can't do" It while the grand
Jury is In session.' - The Lord will for
give!* shouted the preacher. ~ 'I guess
that's right,' said the penitent, *but he
ain't on the grand Jury.' "
He Would Be Left.
""Huh," grumbled Mr. Skinnay, who
was being uncomfortably crowded by
the Jolly looking fat man in the trol
ley car, "these cars should charge by
weight!" :
