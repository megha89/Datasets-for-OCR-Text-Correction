The Seized '..Brandy* -<
Two United States internal revenue
officers came up Tuesday on business
concerning the seizure of the large
quantiy of illicit brandy on the Molh'no
place last week. The officials were B.
B. Hanson, chief deputy in the internal
revenue office in Sacramento, and the
special agent who made the descent
upon the buried liquor out in the woods
as detailed last week. They went up to
the Molfino ranch Wednesday. The
liquor seized consists of seven barrels,
each barrel containing not less than 52
gallons. The brandy is said to be con
siderably over proof, gauging 120 so •if
is said. According to current rumor
the tax on this brandy at 81.10 per gal
lon would amount to about $700. It
seems that the moonshine plan was re
vealed to the revenue officers through
two informers, acting jointly — John
Hosenfelt and J. Thornburg, who live
in that vicinity. They obtained their
clew, through the instrumentality of an
employe - .on - the' Molfino ranch. The
government pays a certain percentage of
the penalty collected from illicit dis
tillers to the parties furnishing the in
formation. In this case this reward
will probably foot up a snug little sum.
The brandy is still stored on the Read
premises in charge of Robert Read jr.
This is the biggest seizure of illicit
spirits that has been made in this
county for many years.
Borello Case Affirmed.
The appea' case of AEOstino Borello,
who was convicted of arson ,<n setting
fire to the Summit house on butter hill
over two years ago, and sentenced to
ten ' years In San Quentin, has been
affirmed by the appellate court. The
text of the decision has not been re
ceived as yet, but is expected in a few
days. Borello. has been held in the
county jail under a writ of probable
cause ever since his conviction pending
the decision of the higher court. He
will now be taken to the state prison to
serve out this sentence as soon as the
remitittur is received from the court of
appeals. Sixty days is the maximum
allowed for the transmission of the re
mitittur to the trial court, so that with
in that time the county will be relieved
of the further care and support of the
convicted incendiary. He is ut the
present time the only prisoner confined
in the county jail.

MINING NOTES
Bunker Hill.— A meeting of the direc
tors was held at the mine last Saturday,
all the members being present except A.
Goodall. The vacancy, in the board
caused by the resignation of W. J. Mc-
Gee was filled by the election of E. H.
Harrington. The officers of the com
pany remain the same as heretofore, W.
F. Detert, president; E. H. Harrintgon,
secretary and superintendent. A divi
dend of five cents per share was de
clared, amounting to $10,000. The out
put'Jor the month of January was over
$24,000— about the same as the yield of
theprevious month. After paying the
dividend and running expenses there re
mains a balance of over 54,000 to be
carried to the surplus fund. The ore
body at the 1750 level continues to de
velop in great shape. It is over 9 feet
wide, and its length has not.yet been
determined, as the end of the shoot has
not been reached. The quality of the
ore is fully as good as in the level
above. Cutting the station at the 1950
level is being pushed ahead. It is ex
pected to have this work completed in a
few days, when drifting for the ledge
will be pressed forward with all pos
sible speed. From six weeks to two
months must elapse before the main
ledge Is reached at this level. It will
then be in order to determine its charac
ter and extent, which will probably take
about two months more. Little doubt
is entertained that the ore body will
hold its own at this depth, but the
policy of the management is to ascertain
by actual development work before pro
ceeding to double the capacity of the
mill.
South Eureka.— On the first of the
month W. H. Schmal of Aneels took
charge as superintendent of this mine in
place of Bayliss Clark, resigned. Mrs
Schmal and daughter Florence left
Angels on Friday last to make their
home in Sutter Creek. Mr Schmal has
been superintendent of the Lightner
mine in Angels Camp, and in that capa
city has had large experience with
mother lode mining. Mr Davis, who
has been foreman at this mine, has been
succeded by the former forman of the
Lightner. Everything is running
smoothly and prosperously as this mine.
The additional 20 stamps to the mill is
making sttisfactory progress toward
completion.
Fine Copper Prospects.— An in
corporated company comprised of a few
local men— Geo W. Urown, John
Strohm, Vie Rocco and several others,
has been prospecting on the Johnson
ranch on Stony creek, about three miles
southwest "of Jackson for copper.

Five Cents Per Copy.
There is a strong iron cap, indicative
of copper deposit, existing on the
claim. This had previously been
prospected to a limited extent, but not
sufficiently to determine its value,
The company has sunk to a depth of GO
feet, and few days ago struck the apex
of the ledge, which looks very promis
ing. The ore is six feet in thickness,
and carries gold and silver values as
well as copper. It is roughly estimated
to carry S3O per ton in these metals.
It would have to be smelted, and the
cost of mining, transportation and
smelting is reckoned at $10 per ton,
which would leave a handsome profit
for the stockholders. The extent of the
ledge in length has not been ascertained,
but there is every indication ■ of a well
defined ledge. Those interested feel
jubilant over the prospects.
Miscellaneous.--The South Eurkea fo
the month of January paid a dividend of
four cents per share, amounting to
812,000. The 'ore body has been penc
trated from the 2700 to the 2000 foot
level, revealing the presence of good ore
the entire distance.
It is pleasing to be able to state that
the Fremont mine is working up to the
point where dividends may be looked
for. The mill is kept running to its
full capacity.
At the Defender an expert from Colo*
rado is examining the property, in the
interest of other parties who are think
ing of investing therein.
Business Premises Sold.
L. Vogeli, the watchmaker and
jeweler, who has occupied the premises
under the National hotel for many
years, has purchased the building on
.Main street next to the Spagnoli drug
store, and which has been occupied as a
saloon by Opie Harper for a long time.
The property belonged to the Bank of
Amador county. The price is reported
to be $3200, which is at the rate of
about $170 per front foot, which shows
that property in the business center of
Jackson commands a stiff figure. Air
Vogeli has purchased the place for his
jewelry store, his present quarters being
far too cramped and otherwise incon
venient. He intends to put In a modern
up to date front, and fix it up in every
respect specially for his business.
The improvements will not be started
until the advent of spring.

THE CITY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENT.
We last week published the financial statement of the city
clerk, showing the receipts and expenses of the municipal
government for the year ending January 31, 1910 — the
fourth year of Jackson's life as a city of the sixth class. The
showing is deserving of notice in several respects. It does
not surprise those who fairly and impartially anticipated the
expenses of maintaining a separate government and the
probable income for the support of the same. On the eve of
Jackson's incorporation December Ist, 1905, the Ledger
published an article on the pros and cons of the incorporation
proposition. The article gave an estimate of the revenue for
the support of the city establishment, and also a rough
estimate of the cost of keeping up the city household. It
will be remembered that at the time the article was published
the statements therein made were criticised by the rabid and
interested advocates of putting on city airs. It was con
tended that the items of our cost bill were wildly exaggerated;
tht salary list and other probable charges were overdrawn.
We laid away a copy of the Ledger containing the article at
the time it was published, confident tnat our estimates were
conservatively drawn, and that the march of events incase
incorporation carried, would vindicate the stand we then
took in giving an impartial and disinterested opinion on the
issues involved, We placed the Ledger in a pigeon hole,
where we could lay our hand on it at any time it might be
needed, to show it was not the Ledger that was embarking in
an airship, but rather those who were so loudly proclaiming
that the question was one of all profit and no loss. In
another column we republish this article, so that our
readers will be able to judge for themselves whether we
correctly gauged the situation at that time. Underneath
that article we reproduce the receipts and expenses of the
city government for the past year, as shown by the clerk's
official statement. The figures speak for themselves, and
need no comment on our part.
Coming back to the showing for the past year, we find
the total expenses were $13,329.28. This is about $5 50 per
head, reckoning the population of the city at 2500. This is
for regular running expenses — the ordinary expenses that
have to be provided for every year. Dissecting these figures
we find that the items of salaries, commissions and rent eat
up over $3000 of this sum. Sprinkling: and water took
$801.12? " Street lighting cost $1311. Under the head of
incidentals — charges that must occur every year with slight
variation, and which contribute nothing toward permanent
improvements — we figure $1368.94. Labor and team hire,
which we presume represents work on streets, $5069.22. It
is not to be disputed' that in the matter of lighting and
sprinkling there is an improvement upon the system in
vogue before incorporation; also more is done on the streets
than formerly. But the questiou is are we getting anything
like value for the vastly increased expenses as compared
with former years. We have no sewer system now any more
than formerly. The sanitary conditions in this regard are
if anything more unsatisfactory than they were before. And
this is said in no spirit of fault-finding, but is based on the
assumption that the city funds have been spent to the best
Now let us turn to the sources of income. The writer
public stated years before Jackson was incorporated that a
municipal government must necessarily entail increased
expense upon the people; that the taxable property was in
sufficient to maintain a separate government without
additional burdens somewhere; and that the business men
would be called upon to put up the deficiency. Now the
financial balance sheet show that last year there was raised
from property taxes $3900— less than one third the total
revenue— while licenses furnished over $6000, or nearly one
half of the total amount expended. The managers had to
come to the conclusion that the city could not be maintained
without a raise somewhere — contrary to the claims put for
ward at the outset when it was claimed that municipal
government would not involve extra expense. The feasible
method of increasing the income was in the matter of liquor
licenses, and these were jumped from $15 to $30 per quarter.
We are not now discussing the wisdom of this increase, but
we simply mention it to shov that the Ledger was under
rather than over the mark in its estimates given over four
years ago.

Just Like a Woman.
A Bostou physician was describing
a week's drive that be took last fall
through Homo of the most picturesque
districts of New Knglaud.
"1 saw much that was luotnorable
and hoard much that was worth re
membering on this quiet, bucolic ex
cursion.
"I remember un elderly Justice of
the peace In a beautiful New Hamp
shire village near Lake Sunapee. 1
stayed there all night with this tine,
keen old man. He amused me and
Impressed me with bIH mordant humor.
"During the evening the question of
the unreasonableness of womankind
came up for discussion. 'Ah,' said the
old Justice, 'woman Is unreasonable,
very uureasonable Indeed, lv fact,
there is no living creature so unreason
able as woman. 1 remember that my
wife and 1 were talking over our af
fairs one day, uud we agreed that it
bad come to the point where we must
both economize.
" 'Yes. my dear.' 1 said to my wife,
'we must both economize— Ubth!'
"•Very well. Henry,' she said with
a tired air of submission to an un
pleasant condition, 'you shave yourself,
and I'll cut your huir.' "—Boston Post.
Hymnological Ineptitude.
The story of a minister who held a
religious meeting In a penitentiary and
aroused the ire of the Inmates by an
nouncing us a hymn that one begin
ning "The dying thief rejoiced to see"
is equaled by tbe tale of. a local
preacher whose church got In debt not
long ago. A cougrogiitlonul meeting
was held for tbe purpose of extricating
It. and the chairman of the board of
deacons, or whatever the financial body
was. got up aud united the situation
and ended by calling for a special col
lection to make up tbe deficit.
- "I suggest that we sing a hymn." one
of the members of the church sug
gested.
This Idea was carried out. and the
number of tbe song was announced. A
smile overspread many faces, however,
when they reached the line. "When we
nsuuder part it gives us inward pain."
Nevertheless the "sundering" process
was most successful and wasn't partic
ularly painful either.— Louisville Cou
rier-Journal.
Tailed Englishmen.
Natives of southern Arabia believe
that Christians your hats only to hide
their horns. Formerly the continent
of Europe clung to the conviction that
the Englishman's netber garments con
cealed a tall. So late us the reign of
Edward VI.. according to Bale, "an
Englyshman cannot travayle in anoth
er land by way of marchandyse or
any other honest occupylnge. but it is
most contumeliously thrown into bis
tetbe that all Englysbmen have tails."
The belief probably arose from the
legend of the "Kentish Longtails."
The people of either Canterbury or
Strpod (for the legend varies) mocked
at Becket as be rode by on an ass
and cut off the ass' tall. Wherefore
they and their descendants were cursed
with tails thenceforth. At least so
said Jesters of other countries, and the
slander eventually reacted upon Eng
land In general. Another version sub
stitutes St. Augustine and Dorsetshire.
Cold as a Cure.
Cold of a certain Intensity produces
not only hunger, but. as it has been
proved, health as well. Raoul Pictet,
the famous Swiss chemist, was mak
ing experiments on a degree of cold
considerably lower than any which
occurs naturally, and he found that
at temperatures between 110 and 150
below zero no covering of any kind
would keep cold out, or, more exactly,
would keep warmth in. There is noth
ing surprising about that The sur
prise Is in tbe result. M. Pictet is a
gentleman who has suffered greatly
from indigestion. After an exposure
of several minutes to the cold which
he bad produced be experienced a sen
sation of- hunger which he has de
scribed as ravenous. When be bad
eaten be experienced none of tbe tor
tures of his ailment, and when be bad
alternately frozen and eaten three or
four times be found himself entirely
cured.— London Telegraph.
The Gallant Ci-bman.
Nothing perhaps produces quite bo
much wit from a cabman us a sense of
being underpaid, which in most cases
means that be bus been justly paid. A
lady who bad been guilty of this kind
of justice experienced the usual sense
of discomfort when her driver straight
ened the palm into which she bad just
dropped her shilling and looked at her
speechlessly. She was weakly about
to add uuother sixpence when the cab
by's sense of humor prevailed. He
transferred the nhilliug to his pocket
and smiled sweetly down at bis em
barrassed fare. "Course, missy." he
remarked, "there was the pleasure o'
drivin" you!"— London Chronicle.
Arundel Cattle.
The most singular circumstance
about Arundel castle Is that Its owner,
by mere right of ownership, la Earl of
Arundel la the peeruge of England. It
is believed that there Is no similar ex
ample of n peerage held on such condi
tions. Apparently there would be no
legal obstacle, were the bouse of How
ard to fall upon evil days and the cas
tle be sold to some millionaire, to pre
vent the millionaire taking bis seat In
tbe bouse of lords as Earl of Arundel.

Pa has no use for suffragettes ; he says
that home's the place
Where woman has the chance to do most
for the human race.
"Why should she want to vote?" [says
pa, "or stand around the polls. .
And let her children go to school with
stockin's full of holes?
"I've got no use for women who get out
and fuss and tear,
Forgettln' that they've homes to run and
solemn duties there.
How many of these suffragettes who say
the'll vote or die
Know how to bake a loaf of bread or
make a decent pie?
"They'd better learn to stitch and hem,
and let the votin' go;
The wife that wants to be a gem ain't
makin' speeches— no. ■;;.:.
She's busy where she ought to be, with
out no time to gad
Content to do the things she knows'll
make her loved ones glad."
Ma sat and darned away awhile and then
she spoke at last :
"1 guess 'you're right," she said; "at
least I want no vote to cast;
As long as I can gjve you joy by humbly
slavin' here,
I'll gladly scrub and cook and darn to
make you happy, dear. ' '
Then pa got up and walked around, and
kicked a chair aside—
"Yes. there you go again," he said, so
mad he nearly cried ;
"Nag just because I can't afford to keep
you like a queen —
And stop that darnin', darn it nil. You
just darn to be mean. "
—Chicago Record-Herald.
Of Such Things
Dreams Are Made.
Perhaps the best instance of the in
credibly great amount of material that
may be crowded in a dream of brief
duration is afforded by the authenticated
case of "the man and the vase." The
circumstances were as follows:
The man sat before his fire drowsily
musing. A draught blowing across the
room set a large photograph on the
mantle above the fireplace to swaying.
A slender vase stood in front of the
photograph, and the man remembered
wondering, in a mood of whimsical in
difference, whether the picture could
blow forward and send the vase to the
floor.
Finally a sudden gust of wind did
topple the photograDh, and it struck the
vase. The man remembered having been
curiously relieved in his somnolent state
that at last "the old thing was going to
fall and be done with it. "
Presently; however. 'he' was is 7 the
midst of a complicated business trans
action in a mining center a couple of
thousand miles away.- All the details of
a new and attractive scheme were com
ing from lips, and. a board of directors
was listening with grave attention. The
scheme prospered. The mining center
grew to be a large city. The man
moved his family west. Bits of the de
tails of his journey thither came to
mind and even circumstances connected
with the constructiion of a fine house he
had erected were brought vividly before
him.
Finally a crash woke him. The vase
had struck the floor. He had dreamed
an unlived life covering years, and all
in the time it took the vase, which he
had seen toppling before he fell asleep,
to fall 5 feet and break.
Won't Need a Crutch
When editor J. P. Sossman, of Cor
nelius, N. C, bruised his leg badly, it
started an ugly sore. Many salves and
oinments proved worthless. Then
Bucklen's arnica salve healed it
thoroughly. Nothing is so prompt and
sure for ulcers, boils, burns, bruises,
cuts, corns, sores, pimples, eczema, or
piles. 25 cents at Spagnoli's drug store.
Petition for
Rehearing Denied
In the case of Fred Martin on habeas
corpus, recently decided by the supreme
court, the attorneys for the mine owners
filed a petition for a rehearing. This is
the case brought to test the eight hour
law as applied to miners, and in which
the court sustained the constitutionality
of the law. * The case was heard in
bane, and the decision was clear and
specific, covering every point in the
case, with no dissenting opinion, and
when the petition for rehearing was
reached the court very promptly denied
the same. This will no doubt settle the
controversy for a while at least.—Prop

Camilla Flammarlon, the noted
French astronomer, says that the va
porous tail of Halley's comet will en
velop the earth on May 19th.
" For several hours, " he says, "We
will be immersed in the gaseous cau
dal appendage whose chemical exam
ination is still little known. The
comet will pass directly between the
sun and the world at 2 o'clock In the
morning of May 19th. At that time the
Pacific ocean will be in full daylight,
while in France it will be night.
Little danger may be expected, how
ever, for the tail will probably be so
rarifled as to be inoffensive."
Prospective Industry
In an experiment to see whether the
famous pipe calabash, which has
proved almost as profitable as diamonds
to Its growers In South Africa, will
thrive in Alameda county, B. ML Ritter
has planted a quarter of an acre of his
ranch with the seed, which he obtained
from the department of agriculture.
The plant produces small gourds, from
which pipes are made that sell as high
as $12 apiece. These gourd pipes are
the lightest made for their size, are
naturally graceful In shape and color
like meerschaum. They are pronounced
by experts to be delightful smokers.
Until two years ago the Boers of South
Africa had a, monopoly in raising the
plant.';/:!;'
The foothills of El Dorado county
should be tested In the production of
the pipe calabash, and we hope some
reader of this paper will give It a
trial. — El Dorado Republican.
Oldest Piece of Iron.
What is claimed to be the oldest
piece of Iron In the world is on exhi
bition at the University of Pennsylvania
as the result of the "Third Eckley B.
Coxe Jr. Expedition to Nubia." The
story of the rinding of this ancient relic,
as well as a host of articles of immense
archaeological value, is told by Dr.
David Randall-Mac-Iver, curator of the
Egyptian section of the archaeological
museum of the university. The iron
Is in the form of a spearhead. This
and other relics were found in excava
tions made in . the ancient town of
Behen, about 80 miles south of Anibeh.
The iron spearhead was found in a
grave of the Twelfth dynasty, of the date
of which scientists are not sure.
Some place it as early as 2800 B. C,,
but others at 2000 B. C.
The Forlorn Hope.
Richard Le Gallienne was talking
about his quarrel with William Watson
over the latter's poem. "The Woman
With the Serpent's Tongue.". This
quarrel, it will be remembered, at one
time threatened to bring the two poets
to blows.
"My quarrel withJWatson, " said Mr.
Le Gallienne, "concerns the crulety of
his verses. They are as cruel as the
remarks of old Herkimer.
"To Herkimer, an elderly widower, a
lady who had rejected him said:
"But don't talk of a "forlorn hope,"
Mr Herkimer, because I have refused
you. There must be other girls in
mind who could make you happy."
"' There were, ' snapped Herkimer—
'and I asked them. You were the for
lorn hope. '"—Los Angeles Times.
The More the Better.
A shy young man had been. calling on
the "sweetest girl in the world," for
many moons, but being bashful his
suit progressed slowly. Finally she de
cided it was up to her to start some
thing, so the next time he called she
pointed to the rose in the buttonhole of
his coat and said :
"I'll give you a kiss for that rose."
A crimson flush spread over his coun
tenance, but the exchange was made
alter some hesitation on his part. Then
he grabbed his hat and started to leave
the room.
"Why, where are you going?" she
aksed in surprise.
"To the-er florist for more roses," he
called back from the front door.
On His Way.
A minister on his way to evening ser
vice met a rising young man of the
place whom he was anxious ot have be
come an active member of his church.
"Good evening, my friend," he said
solemnly, "do you ever attend a place
of worship?"
"Yes, indeed, sir; regularly, every
Sunday night, " replied the young man
with a smile. "I 'm on my way to see
her now. ' '
DANGER IN DELAY
Kidney Diseases are too Dangerous
for Jackson People to Neglect.
The great danger of kidney troubles is
that they get a firm hold before the
sufferer recognizes them. Health is
gradually undermined. Backache, head

merciless succession. Don't neglect
your kidneys. Cure the with

sediment and the passages were attended
by a burning sensation. 1 had severe

The Ledger's Forecast
Of Incorporation
From AmaJor Ledger, Dec. 1, 1905.
It is estimated that the taxable pro
perty within the proposed city, accord-
Ing to the assessment of the county as
sessor, will foot up about 8(300,000.
Reckoning the tax rate nt the maximum
limit of 75 cants on the 5100— and we
venture the opinion that if carried on
the proposed lines, It will never fall
below the rate— we have $4500 as the
Income from direct property taxes. It
must be remembered there Is ne fixity
In the present valuation of property, By
this we mean, that the city assessor
will not be bound by the figures of the
county assessor. He can boost the as
sessment arbitrarily If he so pleases.
And his policy on this point would be
governed solely by the demands of the
municipality for running expenses. If
the revenue from the present valuation
proves unequal to the demands, a stuff
ing of the assessment roll would be . the
first remedy resorted to. Next to the
property tax, license tax would be the
next heavy source of Income for the
support of the city administration.
This tax, based on the present county
schedule, would yield about $3000 per
year. Like the assessement value,
however, the license schedule is liable
to change, to meet requirements. It Is
far more likely to be increased than be
decreased, and many businesses now
free from license imposition, [.would no
doubt be called upon to furnish revenue.
The road poll tax would perhaps yield
$1000 per annum. Here we have a total
or $8500. With this we would have to
meet all the expenses of the city organi
zation. . To many it would seem at
first blush a pretty fair Income, and if
the city lines were drawn compactly
with a desire to economize in operating
expenses, it might be adequate, without
the aid of the stuffing policy, to pay
actual running expenses, and leave a
small margin — and a very small margin
per year is the utmost that the conser
vative frieuds of incorporation would
reasonably expect— for permanent im
provements. As the city is laid out,
however, we cannot see that one dollar
would be left for permanent improve
ments—such as sewers and street
making. The running expenses would
swallow everything in sight. And in
this opinion, we assume that the loca
government will be admisistered
honestly and economically. We do not
take the possibility of graft into con
sideration.
It is not difficult to figure out the pro
position. As a rule the cost of govern
ment per capital varies with population
and territory. A compact territory will
lake less for government than widely
extended territory, with the same
population. The state government costs
over $5 per head ; our county govern
ment costs nearly 810 per head. In the
case of the Jackson municipality the
cost of education would bj cut out.
This is admittedly a large item of ex
pense. But with this eliminated, $4 per
head is a low estimate of cost for a
government worthy of the name. That
would mean 810,000 per year.
Now let us particularize a little. That
portion^of the proposed city that nowf ails
within the present townsite, and strictly
residence districts includes seven miles
of streets actually platted and surveyed.
True some are not built on, and might
not be a charge upon the city for
several years. Say six miles of streets
to be looked after. In addition to this
strictly street mileage, we have from
four to five miles of county roadway
thrown in by way of ballast. Alto
gether, streets and roads would reach
about ten miles. Now, the patchwork
business pursued by the county adminis
tration on our county roads costs on
an average in this supervisor district
over 8100 per mile every year. Such a
meager sum would be completely lost
sight of on our streets. It would have
to be concentrated upon a mile or less
to make any showing at all. Then
sprinkling must be provided, and this is
where the inadvlsability of dragging in
the essentially country roads comes in.
Lighting must be provided for, furnish
ing another strong argument for curtail
ing the city within strictly residence
districts. The salary question is a vital
one. The county government costs over
$2 per capital for salaries alone. If the
city government can get along with one
half that rate, as the territory is mapped
out, it would be doing tolerably well.
On a low estimate this item may be ex
pected to run from 2000 to $2500.
How will this sum up.
Salary list • - • ■ • 92500
Streets and roads, patching • 1500
Sprinkling, as at present done • 1500
Water bill, 500
Lighting, without extending
present area • • . . . 1500
incidentals, rent, stationery,
printing, etc. • 1500
Total • • . • • 89000
These are conservative figures. An
actual test will increase rather than
decrease them. There Is no allowance
here for fire protection: none for
guarantying against contagious diseases
and numerous other items of expense.
It leaves the cost of street making and
sewerage to be borne either by the
property holders along the streets Im
proved, or by the Issuance of bonds, .-
Summing up the situation as It
stands, it shapes Itself this wise: P*
Incorporation holds out the promise
of a sewer for Main street, the grading
of Main street by a systematic effort,
which has been entirely lacking so far.
For these Improvements the property
holders on that street will have pay to
by assessments levied according to
frontage owned. In other words, they
have these things by paying for them
under Incorporation. They can have
them on the same proposition wihout
incorporaion. Again, incorporation
holds out the promise of a public burial
grouni under official supervision and
we are willing to admit this is urgent
ly needed.
On the other hand incorporation
along the present lines holds out the
prospect of a new set of officials to
maintain. And the entire revenue of
the city will be consumed, outside of
keeping up such utilities as we now
enjoy, In paying the salaries of the
official establishment and the Inci
dental expenses thereunto belonging.

Constables May
Hold Their Jobs.
On account of an omission in the
new primary law providing for the
election of township constables, a grave
doubt has arisen in the minds of some
lawyers as to whether constables will be
elected this year or not. The consensus
of opinion among the legal fraternity is
that incumbents will hold on to their
officers until the next Legislature
remedies the defects in the present
election law, so far as it relates to the
election of, township constables.
Be this as it may, however, incum
bent constables who want to hold their
jobs are taking no chances, but are
going right into the right with as much
vim as though their reelection were
necessary. For fear that the supreme
court might unravel the skein to their
undoing before election day, self-pro
tection compels constables to get into
the fight in order to be on the safe side.
Deafness Cannot be Cured
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear
There is only one way to euro deufnees
and that is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous lining of the Bus
taohiun Tube. When this tube is In
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when It Is en

Decision in Scrinc
Administration Contest
In the superior court of the state of
California, in and for the county of
Amador. fyt^i'Z
In the matter of the estate of Sarah A.
Serine, deceased.
Tnis is a contest for letters of admin
istration with the will annexed of the
estate of decedent.
Sarah A. Serine died on Oct. 10, 1909,
a resident of the county of Amador,
leaving surviving as her only heirs,
her two daughters: Mrs Carrie Tarr of
Idaho, and Mrs Nellie Werley of
Alamcda county, this state.
She left a last will bearing date,
July 29, 1908, ■ with a codicil thereto
dated Oct. 9, 1909. By the terms of
said will and codicil she bequeathed
certain property to her grandchild, Ola
G. Werley, who is the minor child of
said Nellie Werley.
Decedent's said daughter Carrie Tarr,
was named in the will as executrix, but
■she has declined to act as such and has
irf writing requested that letters' "of ad
ministration with the will annexed be
issued to the petitioner, H. E. Potter,
who is the public administrator of the
county. '.'-..
John H. Werley who is the- guardian
of the minor, Ola G. Werlev, has . con
tested the petition of Mr ' Potter, and
tiled his own petition praying for the
issuance of letters to himself.
Section 13G3 code of civil procedure
provides that if a person entitled to ad
minister is a minor, letters may be
granted to his or her guardian. . The
rights therefore of Mr Werley ; to letters
will be measured by those that would be
accorded to Ola G. Werlev were she of
lawful age and. here petitioning for
letters in her own behalf.
Counsel for Mr Werley have cited
estate of McLaughlin 103 Cal, page 429
and estate of Engle, 124 Cal. page 292,
to uphold the claim of Mr Werley to
letters. Neither of these cases how
ever sustain his position.
All that 1 was decided in estate of
McLaughlin was that the guardian of
the son of the decedent, who was the
only heir to the estate, but had been ad
judged an incompetent person, was
entitled to letters in preference to the
public administrator. The son being
the only heir was by the statue ; entitled
to letters, it was merely held that the
guardian occupied the same position
that the son would have occupied, had
he not have been adjudged incompetent
to manage his property.
In this case, the mother of Ola G.
Werley being living,, Ola, 'of course is
not an heir of Mrs Serine, and by the
express provisions of sec. . 1365 of the
code of civil procedure a relative is not
entitled to letters (unless he be an heir)
in preference to the public adminis
trator. •
In said estate of Engle cited by coun
sel, letters were issued to one Griffith,
who was not an heir but was entitled to
one-tenth of the estate as devisee, and
the petition of the public administrator
denied, but that was a foreign will and
the case was decided upon authority of
estate of Bergin 100 Cal. 376, where it
was pointed out that the provisions re
lating to the appointment of an adminis
trator with the will annexed of a foreign
will were entirely different from that re
lating to a domestic will, and that letters
upon a foreign could be granted only to
a person interested in the will, and in
estate of Coan 132 Cal. 403 both the
cases of estate of Engle and estate of
Bergin were referred to and it was
shown that the public administrator was
never entitled to letters upon a foreign
will because the public administrator is
not a person interested in the wi11.,.
' Estate of Wakefleld 36 Cal. page 110
seems to present features much like the
case at bar.
- Naomi Wakefleld and her mother
perished in the wreck of the steamer
Rio Janeiro in the harbor of San Fran
cisco. Nanomi died first In a contest
for letters upon the estate of Naomi be
tween the nominee of her two brothers
(who became entitled to the entire, es
tate of Naomi through the death of the
mother and the public administrate^ )the
supreme court held that the nominee of
the brothers would be entitled to letters,
if the brothers were entitled, but as at
the moment of Naomi's death, her
mother was living, her mother became
Naomi's heir, and that letters should bs
issued to the puplic administrator not
withstanding that the brothers through
the death of the mother might be en
titled to distribution of the entire estate.
It is clear that in this case the ex
ccutrix'having renounced her. 'right to
letters and the decedent having died a
resident of this county, the pubilc. ad
ministrator would have the prior right to
letters with the will annexed as against
every person excepting Mrs Nellie Wer
ley the mother of Ola G. but who has
not petitioned for letters.
Since the hearing upon this contest
for letters, mv attention has been called
by counsel, to a paper filed with the
clerk of this court on rebruary 4, 1910,
purporting to be a request on the part of
Mrs Nellie Werley, for issuance of letters
to Mr Werley. Asids from the factjthat
nQ proof has be?n made of the signature
attached to the paper, it would he a
wide departure from the established
rules of legal procedure togive consid
eration to any evidence not introduced
upon the hearing; to do so would be to
receive evidence out of court In the ab
sence of the adverse party, and It is un
necessary to determine in this case the
effect of ti request by the daughter of
Mrs Werley for the appointment of any
peison as administrator; she wa9 duly
notified of the application for letters
made by both Mr Potter and Mr Werley :
she n.ade no application for letters in
her own right, and her request for the
appointment of another made after the
hearing upon the test and petitions,
comes too late and can be entitled to no
consideration. This contest must be
decided upon the evidence introduced
upon the hearing, and it is ordered that
letters issue to the public administrator
in accordance with the law.
Date February 5, 1909.
FRED V. WOOD,
Judge.
Examination for
Census Enumerators.
The examination of applicants for the
positions of census enumerator in
Amador county was held by postmaster
F. A Duden in the supervisor's room,
Jackson, last Saturday afternoon. There
were twelve who had sent applications
for the positions to the supervisor of
census matters in this district, L. L>
Dennett of Modesto. Of these, how
ever, only seven appeared to take the
examination— just enough to fill the
number of enumerators assigned to
this county. The ! applicants were
Jas. Jay Wright, 'W. K. McFarland,
Wm. Hanley, and .V.iss M. E. Mc-
Caskey, all of Jackson; A Prouty of
lone, E. Smith of May; Miss I. Hardy
of Amador. There were no applicants
from townships 3 and 5.
The examination was a simple affair,
and consisted of filling in the require
ments of a couple of census blanks
compiled for the . purpose. ■ The
examination papers were forwarded to
supervisor Dennett at Modesto. The
outcome will be known in a few days.
New Method of
Assessment Work
Assessor Jarvis has adopted a new
method of operations in doing tne field
work in assessing property. Heretofore
it has boen necessary to .do a lot of
copying and this has a large measure
been saved by the improved method.
He has been in various counties, and
has taken notes of the plan of assessing
in other counties, and from these he has
compiled the system which he has put
in practice for the first time this year.
The assessment blanks are not ncarlv so
complicated as formerly. They consist
merely of one sheet, instead of a small
booklet of 1G pages as hereto fore. He has
provided two binders of the loose leaf
pattern. When the assessment of the
township is completed the lists are al
phibetically arranged, and the book be
comes a permanent record. It is eco
nomical and easily kept, and a decided
improvement over the system heretofore
in vogue. The plan was submitted to
the state board of equalization before
being put into practice, and was ap
proved by that body.

A womau newly rich was invited to
an aristocratic dinner party. During
the course of fowl and salad this wo
man noticed with dismay a fat. furry
caterpillar on ber topmost leaf of let
tuce. Glancing up. she met her aristo
cratic hostess' eye. The hostess, too,
had seen the caterpillar. Her gaze im
plored the guest to save tbe dinner
from catastrophe. The guest gave ber
hostess v reassuring smile. Then she
doubled a lettuce leaf around tbe cat
erpillar and swallowed it calmly. The
look of uwe und gratitude that her
hostess guve ber was au assurance
that her footing in society was at last
tirmly established.
"Did you think." said Mrs. Newly
rich to her daughter afterward, "that
I'd lose a clmuce of establishing the
lamlly socially for a little thing like
a caterpillar?'
Spanish Surnames.
In addition to three or four Christian
names tbe Spanish child bears tbe com
bined family names of bis father, and
mother. When the surnames are dou
bled or connected by tbe y, meaning
"and," the flrst Is the more Important
one and the only one that may be tak
en alone, for it Is In tbe father's name,
while tbe last Is in the name of the
mother. In Spain they know no "sen
ior" and "Junior." Father and son
may bear the same Christian name,
but each takes his own mother's name
as a distinction, the father being, for
Instance. Pedro Diaz y Castillo and the
son Pedro Diaz y Blanco. '

Simply a Man Hunt.
"I declare!" shouted a bellboy in one
of the big downtown hotels as bo
dashed into the lobby.
"I declare!" he shrieked again, or nt
least it sounded like that.
An irascible old gentleman whose
rnrdrums were jarred by the shrill
screech wheeled about nnd glared at
the boy.
"1 declare!" he piped louder than
before.
"Well, what's the answer?" demand
<■«! the old man gruflly.
"1 declare!" came the shrill reply.
"Oh. you do, eh?" snorted the old
fellow. "Well, why the deuce don't
you?"
The bellboy cast n" withering gbincv

room and «<mltted a shrill "Declare!"
"Sny," exclaimed the old chap, col

"Xnw. 1 nln't Koln* crazy." replied

Show Window! In Austria.
The Austrian shopkeeper takes great
pride In having his window dressed iv
nn attractive manner and tbe glass
perfectly clean nt all times, no matter
how small tbe shop or how small the
city. Frequently the greater part of
the stock of merchandise is displayed
in tbe windows of tbe smaller shops.
It is much less dim* cult to make at
tractive displays than In American
stores, as windows open outward on
hinges. Even heavy plate glass win
dows ten to fifteen feet square are so
arranged and dressed from the street
instead of from the inside, as In Amer
ica. . The large windows are usually
arranged In the morning before many
pedestrians are on tbe street. The wall
space between shops Is frequently
rented by owners of adjoining stores
and arranged to appear like windows,
giving the appearance of being a large
shop. When one wishes to examine
an article displayed In a window the
proprietor or clerk goes to the street
with a key, unlocks the window and
takes out tbe article, then locks his
window again.
The Only Difference.
Clorlnda was us black as ulght and
of heroic proportions, but In every pos
sible way she copied her slender young
mistress, for whom she had a great ad
miration. "1 like to look jes 1 as much
like you as I can." she often said.
•• 'cause you looks jes' like a lady orter
look. Mis' Hend'son."
Clorinda intrusted all her shopping
to Mrs. Henderson and scorned the
briffht colors and pronounced styles af
fected by her own friends. One day
she asked her mistress to buy her a
pair of low shoes. As she made the re
quest she glanced with ndmlriitlon at
the slim little foot showing beneath
The edge of a dainty, skirt.
"An' I want 'em Jes' exactly like
yours. Mis' Hend'son." said Clorinda.
"no diffence 'ceptln' dey's gottor be
wide nines, so maybe de buckle might
'pear better- if 'twas a teenty mite
lurger'n yours."— Youth's Companion.
Father's Method.
During a recent slight Illness the
five-year-old Teddy, usually so amia
ble, flatly and obstinately refused to
take his medicine. After a somewhat
prolonged and ineffectual argument
with him his mother at last set the
glass of medicine down, leaned her
head ou her bauds and "played" that
she was crying. A moment passed,
nnd the tender henrted Teddy, unable
longer to bear tbe sight of his mother's
stricken attitude. Inquired. "What's
the matter, mother, dear*/" With
out removing her bands from ber
eyes she replied. "I'm grieved that my
son won't take his castor oil for me."
Whereupon Teddy sat up iv bed and
offered consolingly: "Oh. 1 wouldn't
feel bad if I were you, mother, dear.
Father will be home soon, and he'll
make me take it."— Delineator.
Bunching the Hit*.
A legal journal tells v story of an
Illinois attorney who argued to the
court one after another n series of
very weak points, none of which setsui
ed to tbe court to have uny merit uutil
the court ttually said. "Mr. . do you
think there is auytblug In these
points?" To which the attorney re
plied. "Well. Judge, perhaps there Isn't
much In any one of them alone, but 1
dldu't know but your honor would kind
of bunch them."
Had Authority.
A case was being tried before the
late Lord Young, "Crabbe versus Crab
ble."
••I may explain, my lud." said the
advocate, "that my client Crabb* is a

ii few years ago he dropped tbe T In

Matching the Braid.
After ten years he relumed, footsore
aud weary. His wife met him nt thp
door.
"1 thought yon were dead," she told
him.
"You should bare known better than
that," be said. "Do you remember that
last piece of not 1 tried to match for
you? You scolded because there was

the width of the folds, und 1 vowed
tinit 1 would never njtnln return from

He banded her a package.
"Here Is that old rone binding braid
that, you told me to buy. I found It
last Monday In Billing!!. Mont 1 have
looked for It In thirty-seven states."
She tore off the wrappings.
"It Is a little too durk," she said.
"But the sample bus faded some in
ten years." he reminded her.
"It is a little too heavy besides."
"But handling by thousands of clerks
has worn tbe sample away some. It
was heavier when 1 started out."
"1 suppose 1 can make It do," she
said-Newark News.
Her Dim*.
Somebody bad given the east Ride
woman a bad dime. It was composed
largely of lead. She tried to pass It at
several plnces. but they are wary for
some reason or other on the east- side.
They invariably ring a dime on the
counter once or twice and bite it be
sides. When she got home with the
dime it had several holes In it from
the presHuif of east side teeth. "It is
more Impossible than ever," she said.
Tbe Impecunious man called that
evening. He bad a dollar with him
which was wholly intact— that is to
say, it had not been broken.
"I am afraid they'll give me bad
money for it," be said upon taking
his departure, "over here in these east
side cars. Will you change it for me?"
"I Bhull be delighted." said she.
He called a week later with a
grouch.
"You en n't seem to get away from
the bad money over here on your old
east side." be complained. "Somebody
or other stung me with an old lead
dime that was fuli of holes."— New

Convincing the Waiter.
"I hnvp learned bow to make the
foreign waiters In tbe restaurants
where I eat think I bave lived in Eu

who never dines at home. "I dawdle
over my dinner twice as long as any
body else in the place. It requires no
effort for me to do that. By nature
I eat in tbe same leisurely manner
that I do everything else. Most of
my compatriots bolt their food. As a
consequence the foreign waiters who
are used to leisurely dining regard
them with amazed horror.

Amador County
Descriptive Article
Amadop county comprlics an area of
648 square miles. It lies on the wes
tern slope of Sierra Novade <nountaln«,
andemDraces within itr territory all
the diversity of valley, foothill, and
high mountainous lands.
Climate.— The climate of the popu
lous portions of tbe county is as genial
and healthful as can be found anywhere
In California. As climate is one of the
most valuable assets of this favored
state in attracting population, Amador
stands second to no county in this re
gard. It should, and no doubt will In
time, when its climatic advantages are
more thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, become a health resort not
only for those in losb favored states,
but for tbe residents of other parts of
California. The temperature alone the
central portion rarely falls below 30
degrees above zero In winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees In the sum
mer. Snow seldom falls In the settled
districts, and never remains on the
B round for more than a few hours. Of
course, In the high mountain regions
of eastern Amador tbe snowfall is very
heavy— which is characteristic of the
antire Sierra Nevada range. The sum
mer season is al way accompanied with
cool nights; permitting of sound, re*
Freshing slumber. Fogs are rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
infrequent.
Gold Mining.— Tbe county, although
rich in other sources of wealth, com
paratively untouched, Is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. The
deepest gold mines la America lire lo
cated boro. The Kennedy mine Is now
baking gold in liberal quantities from
juartz extracted from a depth of over
3000 feet below the surface, with every
indication that tho pay-ore extends to
% much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold, the county has contrib
uted fully $100,000000 to the world's
jupply of the precious metal. The
mines are still yielding at the rate of
ibout two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
aight or.ten mines operating op what
.8 called the "mother lode," stretching
clear across tho county In a nortb-eaat
arly direction a distance of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate between
100 and 500 stamps, anrl furnish em
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
industry Is still in its infancy. The
unexplored territory, even along tbe
main gold belt, Is far in excess of tbo
ground that has actually been worked
a r prospected. The county offers to
il ay one of the most inviting fields to
be found anywhere in the world for the
investment of capital in the fascinating
business of gold mining, not alono along
the mother lode, but also in the almost
untouched mineralized country ot the
jast belt, somo tentor twelve miles from
the main lode.
Besides gold, we have copper, de
Doslts of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
limestone, granite, and soapstone or
bale — all undeveloped .
Agricultural Capabilities. — The agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce anything that can be
grown in the most favored sections.
In the foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also -u.il kinds of
vegetable are raised where irrigation
Ie practicable along the n v merous water
courses. Furtherup In the mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet, the
boII is admirably adapted for apples
and. potatoes. A ready market for
many times the quantity .now raised of
these commodities can be found In the
various mining towns.
Grape culture and wlnemaking are
becoming Important Industries, both
the grapes and wlno commanding a
bettor price than the product of the
lowland.
Land Is cheap compared with other
California lands. Improved farms may
be secured for one-fourth the price
current m some places. Unimproved
lands can be had from $5 to $10 per
acre. It does not require a fortune to
buy a small ranch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agnculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts now devoted to
cattle ranges might bo made the homes
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amador has a population of less than
12000. Three fourths of this is concen
trated in a strip of three miles above
and below the mineral belt.
Jackson, tbe county seat, has about
2500 Inhabitants, and is an Incorporated
city ol tho sixth class. Other towns
are Sutter Creek, Amador City, Dry
town, Plymouth, Volcano, Pine Grove
and Oleta. lone City Is the metropolis
of the valley section, a thriving town
of 1000 Inhabitants.
The community ls # law abiding. Edu
cational facilities are excellent. A
schoolhousu U within easy reach of
nearly every family. There Is one high
school, located at lone.
The assessment roll for 1000 lsss.—
800,793, and the tax rate for both state
and county purposes $2 on the $100.
The Southern Pacific has, a branch
railroad running to lone." From this

S^ The Tenderfoot Farmer
S^^ It was one of these experimental farmers, who put tfreen
f^, spectacles on his cow and fed her ulinvintf*. Hit theory
W was that It didn't matter what the cow ate so long as she
was fed. The question* of digestion and nourishment had
not entered into his calculations.
It's only a "tenderfoot" farmer that would try such
an experiment with a cow. But many a farmer feeds hint'
ttlf regardless of digestion and nutrition. He might almost as welt eat shav-
ings for all the good he gets out of his food. - The result is that the stomach
grows "weak" the action of the organs of digestion and nutrition are impaired
and the man suffers the miseries of dyspepsia and the agonies of nervousness.

GLOBS SIGHTS
Many things people Insist upon as
rights are really wrongs.
Some people think they dont' have to
pay their debts until they are rich.
Too many men try to make a porous
plaster take the place of fresh air and
exercise.
No man Is ever as important as the
average politician acts when he goes to
Topeka.
Some people never learn : Ben Davis
is fifty-seven years old, and still eats
with his knife.
There are ail kinds of people in the
world, Including some who pride on be
ing good judges of whisky.
When a number of women are togeth
er, and a strange woman comes in,
they are pretty apt to say : "She is an
actress!"
Every ten minutes an idle woman
reaches up both hands and pats her hair,
and then for five minutes she is perfect
ly satisfied.
We have admired a certain woman
twenty five years, except when she puts
on her company manners. Then - she
acts foolish and unnatural.
When a woman goes out of town to
broaden her mind, she comes back with
a good deal to say about the wonderful
tea-cent store she visited.
When a man tips his hat to a woman
his wife doesn't know, she asks him
more questions in the next five minutes
than a child will ask on a railroad train.
When a boy with a telegram calls at a
woman's house, the neighbors on all
sides of her suddenly discover that they
are out of sugar, salt or eggs, and run
over to borrow.
When some men attend a banquet,
they care only for eating, drinking and
smoking; they care nothing whatever
for what is known as a feast of reason
and a flow of soul.
A woman never entirely loses con
fidence in the men until her first born
son, gets lice. Then she loses all faith

The electrically-operated organ-blower
called the " Rotasphere, " a new English
apparatus, is designed to be attached to
the bellows handle of any ordinary large
organ. The handle is given its usual
reciprocating motion by the rotation of a
crank, which is driven, through a chain
and sprocket gear, by a bicycle wheel
having a pneumatic tire. This wheel Is
turned by the friction of a hemisphere
of aluminum, which is mounted on the
spindle of a shuntwound constant-speed
electric motor, and the rate is varied by
swinging the motor on a vertical pivot
so that the arc of contact of the hemis
phere with the tire is altered. The
speed change is automatic. . A chain
connects the organ reservoir with swing
ing motor, and a spiral spring resists
the swing of the motor, so that as the
reservoir rises and falls the chain is
drawn in or pulled out, thus shifting the
arc of contact by its action on the
motor.
The magnetic wheels or O. Heinze, a
Massachusetts electrician, are expected
to give cars power to mount steep grades
without a rack. The wheel contains
four magnet coils, outside of which are
four segments forming part of the tread
of the wheel, and a ring of 12 per cent
manganese steel is clamped between
them and the wheel. By properly tim
ing the energizing of the magnets, each
succeeding jsection is attracted to the
rail just in advance of contact with it,
the current being cut off as soon as the
contact passes. On a 13,000-pound
truck, equipped with two 35 horse
power 550-volt railway motors, a draw
bar pull of 2,500 pounds was developed
with traction due to weight, but with
the wheels magnetized this was in
creased to 8,500 pounds, or more than
300 per cent. . .
The factor)' chimney will soon disap

The war against mosquitoes— strange
as it is, and at first ridiculed, — is one
of the notable mo&ern contests. In
1897-8, surgeon major Ross, then in the
Indian medical service, traced the life
history of the malarial parasite in mos
quitoes, showing how these insects con
vey malaria from man to man, and in
1900, surgeons Reed. Carroll, Agra
monte and Lazear, of the United States
army, proved that one species of mos
quito—the Stegomyia calopus— is the
sole carrier of yellow fever. The dis
coveries ;have made tropical lowlands
habitable. Mosquito regulations have
driven malaria from the Philippines and
ths Panama canal zone; and through
similar measures Havana was reported
in November,* 1902, to have had no case
of yellow fever for a year; although
there were 1244 cases, with 310 deaths,
in 1900. In the yellow fever district
about Rio de Janeiro, in South America,
the fight has been a strenuous |one. In
a new book, Sir Rubert W. Bocye, Dean
of the Liverpool school of tropical medi
cine, states that Brazil had 4,852 deaths
from yellow fever alone in 1898; but the
practical application of the new know
ledge reduced the deaths to 948 in 1004.
Early in 1909 an effort was made to
complete the work. Not less than 153, -
670 breeding places of larvae were des
troyed, 850,575 miscellaneous water re
ceptacles were examined, 44,343 reser
voirs and 004,283 regular water con
tainers were overhauled, as many as
814,650 sinks and water-closets were
oiled, with petroleum, and 2,545 cart
loads of tin cans, etc., were removed
from yards. A ton and a half of pyre
thrum and 30 tons of sulphur were used.
The labor had its reward, for when
summer cante. through it brought more
than 45,000 strangers, the Brazilian
capital was free from yellow fever. •
The pulse of a mouse is too rapid to
determine by ordinary methods. A late
observer, F. Buchanan, has made the
count by suspending the animal with
fore and hind legs dipping in two sepe
rate solutions, thus forming part of an
electric circuit connected with an
electrometer, and photographing the in
strument's oscillations on a strip of
paper moving at known rate. In six
mice the heart beats averaged 670 per
minute, the highest being 780. The
pulsations are about 200 In the rabbit,
90 in the dog, 70 in man, 40 in the
horse, and 30 in the elephant.

Inability to learn to spell has come to
be regarded as due to peculiar brain
organization— a lack in the brain center
for the memory of words.— and it ha 9
been found that in every 2,000 children
in London schools there is one case of
serious "word blindness." As such
pupils may be highly intelligent,
special training seems to be needed to
make the most of their faculties. A
German report mentions a family which
has had not less than four word-blind
members. A perfectly healthy girl of
fifteen, who had gained high rank at
school, could not spell ordinary words,
either from dictation or memory. She
could write single characters correctly,
and could read single series of musical
notes and play the violin by note, but
she could not read piano music.
Through various aids to memory, she
gained high general scholarship, though
her errors in wriitng and even in
reading were almost incredible. The
same inability to receive any mental
impression of words existed in her
grandmother, a woman of much educa
tion, and in her great uncle and a son
of the latter. ,

MONTHLY MEETING OF
BOARD OF TRADE.
Committee Appointed to Arrange
for a Medina of Fruit Growers
of the County.
The regular monthly meeting of the
HI Dorado county hoard of trade was
held at exhibit rooms on Main street
Wednesday night The meeting was
called to order by president Max Micr
son, and secretary Bradner read the
minutes of last meeting, also a number
of communications and inquiries from
home seekers. Two small bills for
printing were allowed and ordered paid.
O. *E. Bremmer, secretary of the
California state commission of horticul
ture, was introduced to the meeting by
R. N. Day. Mr Bremner had arrived
from Sacramento on the evening train
to consult with our citizens regarding a
proposed meeting of the fruit growers of
the county, the object being to get our
growers in line with the other deciduous
fruit growers of the state in the matter
of standardizing the fruit pack and sell
ing the crop under some system which
will prevent the glutting of certain
markets while others have no supply at
all. Mr Bremner explained the proposi
tion in detail to the members of the
board of trad 2, and suggested that it
would be a good idea for the board to
assume the responsibility of announcing
the meeting. This the board decided to
do, and upon motion of S. G. Beach,
Saturday, February 19, 1910, was selected
at the date for , the meeting, and the
chairman was authorized to appoint a
committee to make the necessary ar
rangements for the meeting. S. G.
Beach, H. J Randolph and Charles
Kayburn were named as the commilee.
State horticultural commissioner Jeffery
and many prominent fruit men from
the valley will attend this meeting, and
it is to be hoped that every fruit grower
in El Dorado county will also attend.
The object of the meeting Is <o organize
the growers of this county and get into
affiliation or line with the state organi-
zation formed in Sacramento on Friday
of last week. An account of the Sacra
mento meeting was published in the
Daily Republican of Wednesday, and al
so appears on page 3of this week's is
sue of the Weekly Republican. By
reading that article our fruit growers
will get a good idea of what will come
before the meeting to be held in Placer
ville on the 19th.
After some general discussion in rela
tion to the proposed California state
trades and training schools, which it is
desired *.o see located near this city, the
board adjourned subject to the call of
the president. --Republican
We print this to show that a board of
trade means something in our neigh
borhing county. It is a vital force in
the upbuilding of the county. There is
no reason why a little of the same
energy and get-together spirit would not
answer equally well in Amador county.

The question of education along more practical lines is
seriously agitated. We boast of our school system, and it
certainly is the most liberal to be found hi the world. But
the question is does it accomplish in fitting the graduates for
the practical duties of life, anything like what it ought to
accomplish — anything commensurate with the amount of
money expended. Does it tend to properly equip the pupil
for self-support and the duties of adult life. It is said that
the mistaken, notion prevails among parents that thd
education of their children should be to enable them to 'live
without work. If this idea exists among parents, it must
also permeate the minds of children also. Uufbitunately the
same spirit is fostered, rather than discouraged, by legisla
tures. Auti-child labor laws are thought to be all right for
the protection of youth of both sexes, This naturally
creates an impression in the mind that it is wrong to work,
and the reverse of the proposition is the logical sequence,
namely, that it is right to be indolent. Habits of industry
are discouraged during the critical period when life habits
are in process of formation. It now begins to dawn upon
educators that there must be something radically amiss
with a system that sanctions this. The main object of the
education of the young should be to create a liking, a taste
for work — which simply means a thirst for knowledge.' The
education that fails to do this is faulty at the most vital
point. We hear much about the completion of education
with the free training afforded in the common and higher
schools. The real truth is that such instruction should be
regarded as the introduction to life-long education. The
move to unite the common school education with other work
of a manual character after the child reaches the age of 12 or
13 years seems to hold out the promise of counteracting the
pernicious effect of the no-child-labor nonsense.

Now and again a bit of something falls
his way. .The temptation Is too stroti};
—he reaches toward the morsel. The

a low growl. The dying creature

The Limestone Deposits
Some weeks ago we mentioned that
parties from Jackson and lone visited
the limestone deposits in the vicinity of
Mt. Esho with the view of organizing a
company to market this mineral, should
the ..quantity and quality of the rock
warrant the expense involved in the
undertaking. Two men were thereafter
put to work to open up the deposit lying
nearest to the Amador Central railrcad.
which is distant one mile south of the
place selected for operations. These
men— J. E. Wilson and L. A. Geb
hardt—have been working on this pro
position for over two weeKs, tapping the
limestone formation at different: points
so as to secure fair samples, with the
object of having the same practically
tested as to lime making qualities. The
mountain side was found to be of solid
limeroclf, and a sufficient cut was made
into' the deposit to satisfy the promoters
thst the quantity is oractically inex
haustible." Samples were brought to
Jackson this week and placed in the re
tort of the gas works. When taken cut
the rock was lime of the finest quality,,
said to be equal to the product made in
any part of the state. The two men are
still at work and will test a marble de
posit that crops out near by the lime
stone. It is the intention .tojjget average
samples of limestone and ship to parties
who are, large consumers for the purpose
of a practical test, j Should everything
prove satisfactory the organization of the
company will be pushed ahead, with
the view of running a spur track from
the Amador Central to the quarry, there
by providing ample transportation facili
ties. The enterprise prom { ses much
