A siDgular condition, known as
congenital word blindness, has buen
brought to notice by ophthalmic sur
geons within the last fen years. Its
victims have great difficulty in re
cognizing printed words or learning
to lead, and a recent inquiry in
London elementary schools has led
Dr. C. J. Thomas to conclude tbat
about one person in 2000 is affected
to a considerable degiee. The trou
ble, most common in the lower
classes, occurs much more often in
boys than girls. Last year a bright
boy of eleven could only make out a
tew words of three letters with diffi
culty, although he had been in a
special class four years, and could
read Arabic numerals, work out pro
blems in arithmetic, and recognize
many words when spelled aloud, lu
another case, a really brilliant child
boeame an excellent surgeon, getting
his knowledge at Jeotuies and classes,
with practically no reading. The
initial difficulty is having so many
letters to remember, with so many
variations in sound, and for treating
the word blind an English teacher
has devised a specal series of read
ing books, 'with simplified and phone
tic spelling until the pupil is con
siderably advanced.
For an artificial rubber a German
authority recommends mixing an
infusion of Carragheen moss with
starch, and diying on a slight oiled
metal plate. When the tiansparent
sheet produced is broken up, it
softens in cold water, and on sub
sequent heating it forms a thick
gummy substance, which may be
used for thickening paint or tor many
of the purposes of rubber.
Is a national matrimouial bureau
among the reforms to be proposed by
president Roosevelt. Expert opinion
seems to regard it as already proven
that more scientific selection of
husband and wife canont fail to pro
duce a more virile and higher type of
American men and women.
One of the queerest of odd creatures
is the mud-skipper or jumping fish of
the largo rivers of India and the
neighboring sea-coasts. At ebb tide
these little fishes leave tbe water to
hunt for tiny crabs, flies, etc., and
their strong pectoral and ventral fins,
aided by their tail, enable them to
move about easily and to climb upon
trees, grass and leaves. With their
huge eyes, seeming to project far out
of the sockets, they can see as well
on thfi land as in the water. They
progress in short, quick leaps, effect
ed by sharply bending the rear third
of the body to tbe left and suddenly
straightening it. In color they are
usually light brown with dark bands,
though they sometimes appear light
t green. They are easily caught, and
mi: much used in Burma tor live bait.
Five Cents Per Copy.
Lead wool, n new British product
for packing water pipes, consists ot
very small ribbons of lead, out by
patented machinery in lengths of
three feet. flemp''or yarn is first
pressed into tbe socket, and then the
strand of lead wool is twisted in and
well caulked at each turn until the
whole space is tightly packed with a
mass of lead. It is claimed that the
joint is stronger and more satis
factory than wheu closed by the usual
troublesome method of running in
molten lead.
The asteroids or minor planets, of
which nearly 600 have been recorded
since tbe beginning of tbe nineteenth
century, have been supposed to form
a ring in tbe space between the orbits
of Mar 9 and Jupiter. ' One discovered
on Feb. 22, of this year, however, has
a unique interest in having been
proven to be beyond Jupiter, its
main distance from the sun being 5.25
to Jupiter's 5.20, while its aphelion
distance — 6,151 — exceeds tbat of
Jupiter by nearly the earth's dis
tance from the sun.
Of 30 accidents from electric shocks
in Switzerland last year, 21 were
fatal, while Austria had but 6 fatal
ities in 56 cases. A fifth ot the
accident were from currents of 250
volts or less, and a mason was killed
by a 120 volt tbree-wi?e supply,
while in another case a shock from
26,000 volts did not kill. Of 15
attempts at resuscitation, only one
wns successful.
Asbestos porcelain, the new mater
ial of Garros, a European chemist,
is claimed to have tbe desirable pro
perties ot true porcelain and certain
advantages in addition. As asbestos
fibers aro very thin, with diameters
between 1-100.000 and 1-200,000 of an
inch, they can be crushed to an ex
ceedingly fine powder; this is made
into a paste with water, and after
repeated kneadingsthe mass is poured
into molds. When tbe objects thus
shaped are heated in a crucible to
1700 degrees C, a transparent product
like ordinary porcelain is obtained.
If tbe powder has been washed with
sulphuric acid, a porous asbesto3
porcelain of pale yellowish or white
color results when tbe molded articles
are kept for 18 hours at 1200 degrees
C.
A continuous change in altitudes in
mountainons regions, especially in
the Swiss and Austrian Alps, has
been noted by M. de Varigny, as a
Swiss geologist. Many villages in
tbe canton Valais and in the Bernese
Oberland have been raised or lowered
from 12 to 30 feet in the last six
years, and the summits of mountains
have undergone changes quite as
great. Tbe numerous slight earth
quakes are suspected of being the
cnief cause of tbe phenomenon, or at
least they accompany it, while. they
pruduce avalanches in number now
increasing.
An electrical divining rod, claimed
to operate more certainly and scien
tifically, than tbe ancient and dis
honored twig, has been devised by
Adolpb Scbmid, a Swiss engineer. It
seems to consist essentially of a glass
covered box enclosing a coil of in
sulated wire in which a slightly
magnetized needle is free to rotate
over a graduated dial. When the
apparatus is placed over subterranean
water, with tbe axis of tbe coil in the
magnetic meridian, tbe needle, it is
asserted, oscillates more or less
rapidly tor 2 to 10 and even up to 50
degrees.THE AMADOR LEDGER

CITY OFFICIAL PAPER.
Official Paper of Amador co.
FRIDAY JULY 13, 1906
We want a local correspondent in
every town in the county. To any
one who will regularly send us the
happenings in bis or her locality, we
will not only send the Ledger, but a
daily San Francisco paper, and other
reading matter, as well as supply the
correspondent with all necessary
stationery and stamps for corre
spondence. We must have a live
correspondent at every point, even if
we have to pay cash for such service.
Now who will volunteer for this
work.
Congressman Gillett is making a
tour of the southern part of the state,
to size up the situation politically.
He annoucnes that he is not to be
considered, under any circumstance,
a candidate for renomination to con
gress. He is after the gubernatorial
plum, and nothing else. It is that or
nothing with him. And there is no
question that be has considerable
strength behind him, whether suffi
cient to land the prize is a moot
point. It is hardly probably that
any candidate will come anywhere
near having a majority at the outset.
The prospect for a stubborn and pro
longed fight are excellent, if such a
scrimjiago oan be Htly designated by
such an expression. There are at
least six candidates spoken on the
republican side, namely, Pardee,
Gillett, Porter, Hayes, Gage and
Edson, " with others in the back
ground. If a Wtter contest ensues,
creating animosities that will be
likely to exert a potent influence
upon the success of the leading candi
dates, a compromise candidate may
be trotted out, satisfactory to all the
warring elements.

The spasm for Sunday observance
at Louisville, Ky., has resulted in a
determination to prosecute tho pub
lisher of Sunday papers there. Those
spasms occur at intervals all o»er the
country, from New England to Cali
fornia, and the result is always trou
ble, quarreling and expense. The
spaam usually lasts three or four
months; then the towns arflioted drift

Fatally Burned.
A deplorable case of fatal burning
happened at Latrobe on Friday last,
the victim being a bright girl named
Emily Julia Muller. She started to
light the flrf) to prepare the evening
meal, nnd resorted to the dangerous
practice of using coal oil for this pur
pose. In pouring the oil on the fire,
the contents of the can ignited and
exploded, setting tire to her clothing.
She ran outside screaming, and threw
herself on the ground to extinguish
the flames, but before they were
extinguished she had received terrible
burns, and died of her injuries on
the following day. The funeral was
conducted on Monday last, H. E.
Potter ot Plymouth, being the under
taker. The unfortunate victim was
14 years, 6 months, and 14 days old.
Something doing on the 18th.

The Le Doux Case.
In the case of Mrs Emma Le Doux,
convicted of the murder of A. N.
McVicar in Stockton on the 23d of
March, last Monday was the day lixed
by the superior court of San Joaquin
county, for passing sentence, upon
the convicted prisoner. There was
one possible sentence to pronounce
under the form of verdict rendered—
namely, the penalty of death. The
court room was again crowded with
the morbidly curious, the wemen
greatly predominating. Mrs Ledonx
appeared attired in black, and seemed
pale, and shrunken in features, and
worn out, but still self-possessed and
dignified in bearing. She was repre
sented by Attorney Fairall. C. 11.
Crocker was not present, he having
business to attend to in San Andreas.
When Judge Nutter ordered Mrs
Ledoux to stand up, sho rose to her
feet, placing her bunds upon the
table before her as if to support
herself. Xho court asked if she had
legal cause why judgment should not
be pronounced. At this point attor
ney Fairall interposed; and the de
fendant resumed her seat. The attor
ney theroupou made a motion for a
new trial, alleging misconduct on
the part of the jury, errors of the
court in its rulings, illegal seizure of
letters belonging to the accused ; the
prejudice of officials entrusted with
the duty of summoning jurors; also
the ruling ot the court in not per
mitting the dofendant to introduce
evidence disproving motive, and in
troduction of evidence relative to a
bjgamous marriage. A sensation was
created when the attorney introduced
two affidavits tending to show pre
judico ou the part of at least one
juror, August C. Ritter. One affidavit
was sworn to by Charles F. Murphy,
a colored person, 19 years of age.
It read as follows:
"Charles F. Murphy, being first
duly sworn on oath deposes and says,
'1 am 19 years of age and reside at
735 East Main street, in the city of
Stocktou. 1 have known August C.
Hitter, who was one of the jurors in
the trial of the defendant, Emma Le
Doux, in the above entitled cause,
tor a period of two years: that after
the said August C. Ritter was selected
and sworn as a juror in said cause,
and while said cause was being tried
in the above court, and before the
taking of testimony bad been closed
and the cause submitted to said jury,
affiant mot said August C. Kitter in
the courthouse of San Joaquin county
and asked him what about the wo
man, referring to the defendant above
named, and said August C. Kitter
replied: "t will hang the ,"
referring to the defendant."
The other affidavit read as follows:
"William H. Smith, on oath being
duly sworn, states that he is well
acquainted with August C. Kitter,
one of the jurors in the above entitled
cause and one of the jurors who tried
said defendant, Emma Le Doux, and
found her guilty; that after the com
mission of the offense charged against
the defendaut and prior to the time
of his selection as a juror in said
case, the said August C. Kitter said
co affiant: '1 believe that woman,'
referring to defendant, 'is guilty and
she ought to have hor neck broke.'
After said Kitter had been selected
as a juror, affiant met Kitter at City
Park, at the east end of Main street,
in Stockton, and was told by said
Kitter that he was down there sweat
ing ou the Le Doux jury. Affiant
then said, 'How can ycu serve as a
juror in that case,' and Ritter said
'Well, 1 am there', and nothing
more. "
The affidavits staggered the court,
mainly no doubt in the audacity in
volved iv their presentation. Under
the instruction of the oourt the jurors
were not allowed to talk about the
case either among themselves or to
outsiders during the trial; to attempt
to converse about the case to a juror
was contempt of the court, and yet
two men came forward and admitted
that they had actually talked with
Kitter about, the case. Kitter, it
seems, is not in the state at the pre
sent time. He is somewhere iv the
east on a visit to his mother, and
hence it will be some time before he
will be able to answer the charges
made against him. Judge Nutter at
once ordered citations to issue, com
manding the affidavit makers, Murphy
and Smith to appear ou Tuesday to
show cause why they should not be
punished for contempt of court. The
court ordered them to pay a line of
8100 each and be imprisoned tor two
nays.
The bearing of motion for new trial
was continued until Ritter can be
heard in his own behalf.
Caution to Water Consumers.
To stop the wastage of water during
the night, all oonsumers are hereby
prohibited from using water for
sprinkling or irrigating after 9 o'clock
p. m. Persons found allowing water
to run after that hour will be liable
to have the supply cut off for all
purposes. And a charge will be made
in order to have the domestic supply
turned on again. 1 am compelled to
adopt this rule, because the wastage
lately has boon so great, that it has
been impossbile to keep the tank full
at night for protection against fire.

New Cases.
W. Jarman and wife vs. W. 11.
StelHer, executor of estate of Mary A.
Hall, deceased. — The complaint sets
out that within two years past, Mary
A. Hall became indebted to plaintiffs
in the sum of 8165 for money advanc
ed and expended by them on her
account. Defendant died April, 1905;
that the claim for 8100 on aocount of
such claim was presented to the
executor and by him rejected. For a
further cause complaint alleges that
Mary A. Hall, was at the time of her
death indebted to plaintiffs in the
sum of $460, for work and labor in
nursing, oaring tor, and sewing done
by plaintiffs for her. On Febru
ary 23, 1906, they presented said
cloim to the executor, which was re
jected. For further cause Mary A.
Hall was indebted to plaintiff for
board and lodging in the sum of $280,
which claim was also rejected. Suit
is therefore brought to reoover the
several amounts, and costs of suit.
Kain and Wbitehurst are attorneys
for plaintiffs.
Fred Raab, owner of the Sutter
Crock livery stable, has commenced
an injunction suit against the board
of supervisors, and Giovanni Levaggi
and M. Levaggi, to enjoin them from
the construction ot the new bridge
over Sutter creek, in such a manner
as to interfere with plaintiff's pro
perty. The complaint alleges that
plaintiff is the owner of the lot ad
jacent to said bridge; that the super
visors agreed to place the masonry
abutment of said bridge six feet
north and parallel with the old wall
along the south side of Sutter creek,
so as not to interfere with the tree
use of plaintiff's pioperty and livery
stable; instead thereof they propose
to construct the wall at less distance
than six feet north of the old wall,
which would cut off access to and
from the livery stable. A temporary
injunction was issued, and the matter
of whether the same should be made
permanent came up for hearing in
the superior court last Monday. At
the time appointed, however, it was
stated that the differences had been
amicably settled out of court, Jand
the proceedings were thereupon dis
missed.

THE AMADQB .LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, JULY 13, 1906.
THE STAPLES' MURDER CASE.
Judgment of Death Reversed by
Supreme Court— A New Trial
Ordered.
Wednesday morning, W. J. McGee,
the attorney who has had charge of
the case of F. N. Staples, on appeal
before the supreme court, received a
telegram from the clerk of that
tribunal announcing that the court
had rendered a decision reversing the
judgment of the lower court, and
ordering a new triul. The case has
been pending before the higher court
since November last. it was argued
and submitted in the early part of
the year, and parties interested bad
been expecting a decision at any
moment tor several weeks. The long
delay created au impression that the
case was anythiug but a clear one
from the prosecution's standpoint, and
that a reversal was more than pro
bable. Other murder cases submitted
even after the Staples' case, had been
decided, and in every instance the
judgment of tbe trial court was
upheld. The "hanging fire" in this
particular case was taken to mean
that a coutiary decision would be the
outcome iv tbe Staples matter.
On receiving the telegram, W. J.
McGee repaired to tbe county jail,
and was at once admitted to the pre
sence ot tbe prisoner under sentence
of death. The document announcing
ihe glad tidings that the life of the
defendant was relieved, temporarily
at least from forfeiture to the majesty
of offended law, was read to him.
He was glad of course, but made no
demonstrations of joy such as might
be eSpected of one in his predicment.
He simply remarked, "That's pretty
good." The attorney said, "Well,
let us shake on it," and the two
grasped hands cordially.
Staples was not a surprised man at
the good news. Indeed, he would
have been greatly surprised at any
other outcome. He stated, that it
was only what he had expected all
along when the matter was looked
into by disinterested and impartial
men. He was asked it be wanted to
send word to his friends, and he
answered 'yes. ' Two telegrams were
written out, announcing merely that
the court bad granted a new trial.
One was sent to defendant's father,
in Farmingtou, Maine, aud the other
to Mrs Emily Maud Hoxie, who was
indicted with tbe defendant for com
plicity in tbe murder of Mrs Staples,
for which the husband was convicted.
This was sent to Piacerville, where
Mrs Hoxie is engaged in the millinery
business.
It was circulated around that tne
defendant held a soit of levee in jail
in the evening, aud received con
yratulatious from visitors, male and
female. We are able to say that noth
ing of tbe kind occurred. Staples is
quite bandy as a sketch artist. He had
made some pictures aud giveu them
to parties in town. He also promised
samples ot his handicraft in this line
to others. According to prior ar
taugpinent three ladies called Wed
nesday evening for these pictures.
The meeting had nothing whatever to
cio with the appeal proceedings, and
hn:i no bearing on the news ot the
granting of a new trial.
The reversal of the judgment of
conviction was iully anticipated bj
most people. Notwithstanding, it
was one of tbo longest and costliest
trials ever held in Amador county,
any other decision by the appellate
court would have proved a sore dis
appointment aud surprise to the
people generally. The feeling was
abroad tbnt Staples ought to have a
new trial. That the crime had not
b>en fastened upon him to the extent
ot warranting the hiking of human
lifo.
The full text of tbe supreme court
decision has not been received. We
will print it at the earliest possible
moment. It is of much interest to
know on what particular ground tlie
reversal of the Amador court is based.
It is generally supposed that the
inherent weakness of the evidence to
support tho verdict is the main
stumbling stone.
If this should prove to be the point
on which the reversal binges, it is
the prevailing opinion that it will be
conclusive ot the whole matter. It
would be useless to no to trial again
in the face of such a decision, unless
other and stronger evidence can be
produced, which is not probable.
George Peterson, of Sutter Creek,
was brought to tbe county hospital

Word was received by Mrs Glavino
vich yesterday that her sister, Miss

Spsiguoli, was severly injured by be

out iv a buggy with her brother Ben
Soaßuoli, driving on the San Pablo
road, about a mile from tbe Spagnoli
home. In trying to control the
horse on tbe approach of a car from
the front, the lines becamo entangled,
resulting in another car from tbe rear
striking the vehicle, throwing Mis*
Spaguoli out. The horse ran away
some distance. Benme was also
bruised up considerably, and was
carried quite a distance from where
his tister was thrown out. He re
paired to tbe spot, and found her
unconscious. He secured assistance,
aud convoyed her home. It was a
long time before she came to. Tbe
extent of her injuries is not known,
but it is believed she will be fully
recovered iv a few days.

Board of Equalization.
The supervisors met as a board of
equalization on Monday last. All
the members were present. There
were no applications or petitions
either for an increase or decrease
of assessment, so tbe board adjourned
to meet again Monday next, which is
the last meeting for equalization
purposes. One would reasonably
suppose that this failure to ask for
relief through tbe equalization board
shows that property holders generally
are satisfied with their assessments.
But the facts hardly warrant such an
inference. The truth is the property
holders as a rule, are not aware ol
the valuation set upon their property
for assessment purposes, until the
time comes to pay taxes, when it is
too late to seek relief. It is true,
they have in most cases the state
ments handed in to the assessor to go
by, and the valuation ot the preced
ing year. There certainly ought to
be some provision made by Jaw tor
informing property holders on this
vital matter prior te the meeting of
the board. Not tor many years has
the equalization board of Amador
county had business of any magni
tude to transact. The annual meet
ing for equalization purpose is mainly
a mere matter of formality.
A Suprised Parson.
Last Saturday evening the Metho
dist parsonage was the scene of a
most delightful surprise party, the
occasion being the birthday of Rev.
C. E. Winning, the pastor of the
local chmen. For several days the
secret plans were being formed, and
about nine o'clock tho friends took
friendly possession of the parsonage
aud a most delightful evening was
enjoyed. Rev. Winning has been
almost two years in Jackson and bis
friends are not confined to any one
denomination, and they all wish for
him many happy birthdays. The
party was well planned and well
carried out, and was much more of
a surprise than is usually the case.
There has never been a more coidial
relation between the people of Jack
sou aud tho Methodist pastor than
now exists, aud the birthday of Mr
Winning gave the community an
opportunity to express its kindly
feeling to the delight and satisfaction
of all concerned. We do not know
Mr. Winning's age, but he will be
one year older on the seventh of next
July.
Change of Mail Service.
There is much complaint at the
north end of the county — Drytown
and Plymouth particularly — on ac
count of the new mail schedule, that
went into effect on the first of tbe
month. Mail matter from Jackson
for these towns, instead of going
direct as heretofore, now goes to
lone, and thence to Carboudnle, and
is there taken by stage with San
Francisco and eastern mail to Ply
mouth, arriving there about five
o'clock in the evening. Whereas,
under tbe old schedule, letters and
papers from Jackson left every rrrorn
ing about seven and reached Ply
mouth about 10 a. m. The present
arrangement is therefore seven hours
loss in the time of delivery ot mail
from points along tbe mother lode
from Jackson to Amador City. The
postal department called for bids
for cariying the mail between Jack
son and Plymouth, but tbe bids were
deemed too high, and beuoe tbe new
route was decided upon. The Ledger
printed Friday afternoon, if sent by
the regular route, would reach Ply
mouth Saturday evening. To accom
modate the people, we will endeavor
to tend the bundles for Plymouth and
Drytown by Steiner's stage,- which
leaves early Saturday morning, aud
iv that way the papers will reach
subscribers the same time as former
ly. For all points on tiie motber
lode south of Drytown the Ledgeis
will arrive Friday evening, instead of
Saturday morning.

Scalped in the Mine.
1b 3 Gwiu mice was tho sceno of a
most singular accident last Friday.
Tbe peculiarity consisted nut so
iniicii in the manner ot the misfor
tune, as tbe nature of the injuries
sustained. Frank Lorko is the name
of the unfortunate miner. He was
working alone in one of tbe stopes.
In some way he lost his footing, and
fell thirty-five feet. He fell bead
foremost, but it is supposed that his
descent was broken at several points
in route to the bottom. When he
finally landed, he was perfectly
consoious, aud found his hair and
scalp attachment had slipped from
their moorings on the top of his
bead, and were actually dangling
over bis shoulder. His contact with
tho sharp edges of rock in bis in
voluntary flight had raised his hair
as neatly as though done by an
Indian warrior in war path times-.
He was nonplused for a moment at
his peculiar predicament, aud covered
with blood. Carefully throwing his
wool back over his head, to the place
where tho hair ought to grow, ho
then sought assistance. He was
taken to the surface, and tbe services
of Dr. Phillips of Jackson were called
in requisition. The surgeon found it
the cleanest case of scalping that had
ever came under his observation.
The skul; was not fractured in tbo
least, but both skull aud scalp nad to
be washed thoroughly ot the coating
of rock and dirt, which they had
accumulated in the ruixup. It took
a large number of stitches to secure
tbe hairy appendage to its rightful
position. It will take the victim
some weeks before he is sufficiently
recovered to tackle underground
operations again.
A Decided Improvement.
This week workmen under tbe
supervision of trustee Garbarini,
have removed all the wood planks iv
front of several business places on
the east side of Main street that pro
jected over the sidewalk and into the
street proper. These extensions were
placed so as to enable persons to
lounge there, without interfering
with passenger travel on the side
walks. As the chairs had to go, these
projections for tho chairs to rest
upon also had to go. Main street is
rid of these unsigh'ly wooden addi
tions from one end to the other.
While on this subject it is well to
notice that there are several cement
projections remaining, which are as
serious a menace to the proper main
tenance of 'the street as the planks
that have been taken away. They
obstruct the drainage, and gutter
way, and while they are tolerated it
is impossible to secure a proper
drainage of the street. These should
go also. There will still be the tele
phone and electric poles to obstruct,
but as these are there by right con
ferred by the supervisors, we presume
they have to remain.
Yorlander Estate Closed.
J. H. Lianghorst and his attorney
went over to San Andreas last Mon
day to settle tbe affairs of the ad
ministration of the estato of Richard
Vorlander, who died nearly a" year
ago in Mokelumne Hill. He willed
his property to relatives in Germany,
and named J. 11. Langhorst as
executor. The deceased was an old
time miner of this county. He miued
in the vicinity of Middle Bar on the
old Spanish mine, now known as tne
Mammoth, from which W. A. Nevills
got his lir.-;t: start as a mining mag
nate. The old miner lett no relatives
in this county, that wore known,
and the executor had considerable
trouble iv finding out ail tbe heirs
who were entitled to share iv the
distribution. The estate consisted of
$2800, all in cash. After paying all
expenses, there remains 52121 iv the
hands ot tbeexecutoi for distribution.
This is an excellent showing; as in
accordance with the will the remains
were cremated, aud forwarded to re
latives in Germany, and this, with all
legal expenses, traveling to and trom
San Andreas, attoruoy's tees, etc., is
covered by $700. The estate is now
virtually closed, as far as court pro
ceedings are concerned.

MINING NOTES.
Kennedy.— A new pipe is being laid
from the reservoir to the mine, to
supply old works with water. Permis
sion has been giveu to connect a four
inch main to carry water for tire
purposes, for the protection of the
residents on the Flat and around the
mine. As theie is considerbale pros
sure this will afford a good supply in
case of fire.
Bay State.— This property, two or
three miles beyond Plymouth, has
resumed operations, under the
management ot stockholders and
others. There is an abiding taith
among a nuruler of those interested
that a paying mine exists at this
point on the mother lode. For some
fifteen years the work ot development
has been vigorously prosecuted, with
short intervals of rest. At times tbe
prospects appeared exceedingly bright,
aud the mill returns promised to pull
tbe promoters through till right. But
somehow something has turned up to
blight the outlook temporarily, and
leave the property in the struggling
position it has been in for so many
years. We hope that tbe present
effort to try it again, will prove the
commencement of a long period of
profitable working for this mine,
which is the only claim in the north
end of the county in active operatiou.
The lone Saloon Case.
Tbe case of Jos. Visseaux, arrested
on an^amended complaint tor selling
liquor within two miles of the Pres
ton school, will be tried before justice
James McCauley in lone today. The
defendant demanded a jury trial, so
that twevle men, or a lesser number
if both sides are agreeable thereto,
will have to pass upon the merits of
this case, and agree upon a verdict in
order to decide it. C. P. Vicini,
district attorney, will represent the
prosecution and A. Caminetti will
appear for the defendant. All the
parties engaged in the liquor business
in lone were arrested on the came
charge originally. But when tbo
district attorney went down at tbe
time set for the arraignment, and
examined the pleadings, be was not
willing to go to trial on the com
plaints tiled. A demurrer was put in
by the defendants, and sustained.
The defendants were thereupon dis
charged. A new complaint was drawn
up and Visseaux re-arrested. The
others were not re-arrested, action
beiug deferred until tbe outcome of
the present case is known.

DIAMONDS IN VOLCANO.
A Fine Stone Discovered in Gravel
Mining.
James Cosgrove is an old-time
miner in Volcano district. He is
operating the old Matt White gravel
mine on Indian gulch— a claim that
has been worked since the early days
of gold. mining in that famous dis
trict, and one that has surrendered
its bidden wealth liberally in response
to the industry of the miner. Mat
thew White, an eccentric Scotchman,
worked it successfully for many years,
and took out quantities of gold. He
indulged iv two or three trips to bis
native land on tbe proceeds. On
getting beyond the age of active min
ing be deeded tbe mining claim
to Cosgrove, one of the conditions
being that the grantee should look
after and care for the grantor in his
old age— a promise that was faithfully
kept by Cosgrove. A few months ago,
Cosgrove repaired to the old man's
cabin, after working iv his claim all
day, and found him dead— he had
committed suicide, as he had often
threatented, by shooting himself
through tho head.
The mining claim consists of 20
acres It used to be worked by
hydraulic process, but for many years
past it has been operated by ground
sluices. Jt is one of several claims
trom which diamonds have been
casually picked up from the tailings.
Two or thr^e weeks ago, in panning
out, he noticed a small stone that
seemed to glow in the water with
unusual brilliance. He at once con
cluded that it was a precious stone
of some kind, and its whiteness in
dicated a diamond. In the rough it
is rare that diamonds show their
brilliance in that way. This stone,
however, had come in contact with
the grinding process of water and
gravel that natuie had thereby im
parted a face to reveal its merits in
reflecting light rays. Tbe miner
picked it out ot the debris, and
brought it to Jackson for examination
by the jewelers here. J. H. Lang
horst and others pronounced it a
diamoud of the first water. In hard
ness and brilliancy it will compare
favorably with tho finest from the
Soulb African fields. It is a small
stone, not quite as large as an ordin
ary pea, even in the rough, and when
subjected to the art of the lapidary
iv cutting facets, it would be reduced
to smaller dimensions. The ownei
has been ottered 820 for it as it is,
but declined to part with it.
No systematic effort has been made
to recover these gems from the
gravels of Volcano. It is not known
whether they exist iv sufficient
quantity to make it an object, to put
in special machinery for their ex
traction.

THE AMADOR LEDGER; JACKSOfr, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. JULY 13. 1906
Washington
Letter.
(Prom Our Kegular Correspondent, i
Washington D. C. July 7, 190 G.
Congress and tho president are tak
ing leave of each other in a much
better frame ot mind than could have
been expected from their meeting last
year. There has been a conflict ot
strong personalities and both sides
have won their points to a certain
degree while the public on the whols
has been tho gaiuer. The president
has managed to force through certain
legislation that he belioved was need
ed and that there was serious doubt
if congress would stand. He has re
moved the postmasterships from the
realm ot federal patrouago, and thus
done, more than any other president
ever dared to do to antagonize the
individual members who looked on
these ottices as the lbst remnant ot
the fast disappearing currency with
which to pay political debts.
He has forced through the rate bill,
and while there may lie some features
of the measuro that could bo improv
ed and doubtless will be improved in
time, it is vastly in advance of no
legislation at all, and that was what
was looked for a fortnight before eon
gross met. '1 hi' in I.'1 .' alcohol Mil has
gone through, promising to help the
farmers ot the whole country and to
help the public greatly against one
form of fuel extortion. Tho state
hood bill Has been a compromise but
has brought satisfaction and dignity
to two commonwealths and would
have brought it to four, but tor the
unreasonable opposition to the mea
sure in congress. 'I ho pure food bill
is a law, and meat inspection has
been added where it wag sorely need
ed and where the pubile did not even
suspoct that the need existed.
Altogether it has been a most not
able congress and one that will
necessarily go down in history as a
monument to the forceful personality
of tne executive asido from the per
sonal triumph ot the peace conference
and numerous other smaller mutters,
any one ot which would have been
enough to make an administration
notable.
While one is looking over the retro
spect, it is as well to take note of the
remarkable series ot national scandals
and exposures, all of which, the ex
posures at least, were more or less
due to the fearless initiative of the
president, it was the most deplor
able series of publip scandals that a
nation has ever suffered, but it was
infinitely better that tiie evils should
come out, than that they should
eat at the national life iv secret.
There were first of all the postal
scandals. They were more than halt
suspected by those "iv the known"
before official attention was ever
called to them. Bat when they were
once brought to the attention of the
president, the word was passed that,
they were to be ferreted out without
tear or favor and this was done, re
sulting in more than a score ot pro
secutions and half as many jail
sentences while the end of the legal
proceedings is not yet. Hut the de
partment itselt is cleansed and
chastened as a department seldom
has been before.
The crop report exposures followed
with remarkable swiftness resulting
iv an entire reorganization of that
branch of the department of agricul
ture. The awakening of the" public
conscience was helped by the insur
ance exposures iv New York which
while not directly under federal
supervision, were along the line of
the same work. Thou there were the
inquiries, into the beef combine by
the bureau of corpoiations, resulting
in the famous ''immunity bath"
farce and then the swifter and more
remarkable exposures of the Neill-
Keynolds report. S*de by side with
these were the investigations of the
bureau of corporations and the inter
state commerce commission into
combinations of the coal and oil
carrying roads and these like the
others will be followed by a series of
prosecutions that have already been
outlined aud that promises to be very
effective iv their execution.
It may be stated that the good re
sults coming from these investigations
aud prosecutions are more indirect
than direct. The mere knowledge
that the law was on its track was
enough to force tho dissolution of the
paper trust. The coal roads have
already begun an internal overhauling
on their own account, now they find
the public knows how rotten were
some of their conditions.
The suits against the tobacco trust
have already resulted iv some good to
the industry at large, and it may be
taken tor granted that no corporation
managers are going to venture very
far inside the penitentiary when they
know that there is a watchful eye and
a ready hand to shut the door on
them it they trespass over the line.
Tho rumor on l-'riday that thero was
a possibility of coDgress adjourning
on Friday night, brought a crowd ot
visitors to the Whito House to say
good byo to the president before tho
cabinet meeting, aud a special tram
was held iv roadine&s at tho depot to
take him to Oyster Bay even it it
were late at night before congress
finished up the session.
Tho president has earned a good

vacation if ever au executive has, and
wuile thero is not tho urgent need of
it that there would be in the case ot
a man who was not about as delicate
aud fragile aa a grizjly bear. Mr
Koosovelt himself will welcome the
chungo aud the chance to get once
more to out of door life and to work
olf some of the ilesh that has accum
ulated during the winter in Washiug
ton iv spite of hia constant teunis
pluyiDg, walking aud horseback
riding. l'bero will be au effort to
keep just as much work from him as
possible while he is at Sagamore hill.
But there is a certain amount of rout
ine and special work that the presi
dent has to do even in summer, aud
the modest little executive office at
Oyster Bay has beeu all lixed up iv
readiness for his coiniug, and will in
all probability see a considerable
amount both of personal and public
work dove before the summer is over.

Mrs. G. S. Estey and sister, Miss

three or four weeks. The little girl
was thrown down tho sido cf the
mountain about thirty feet among

Where Four States Meet.
The United States is the only
country iv the world that has a "four
curners, " that is to say, a place
where four states meet. L<ook at
your atlas, says the Chicago .News,
and you will see Colorado, Utah,
New- Mexico aud Arizona touching
each other. At no other place ou the
globe do four states, territories or
provinces uuite to form such a juue
tiou. The spot is on a spur of the
Carizo mountains, aud few tourists
visit it, partly because it is not easily
accessible aud partly because com
paratively few people think about it.
A monument marks it, however,
erected by the government surveyors.
The point is reaohed by a trail load
iug from the road from tho Navajo
springs in Colorado, iv the Ute
reservation, to the Sun Juan river.

Whose Say=so is Best?
With nearly all medicines put up for
sale through druggists, 0110 lias to take
the maker's .say-so alone as to their cura-
tive value. Of course, such testimony is
not that of a disinterested party and
accordingly is not to be given the same
credit as if written from disinterested
motives. Dr. Piorce's medicines, how-
ever, form a single and therefore striking
exception to this rule. Their claims to
the confidence of invalids does not rest
solely upon their makers' say-so or
praise. Their ingredients are matters of
public knowledge, being printed on each
separates bottle wrapper. Thus invalid
sufferers are taken into Dr. Pierces full
confidence. Scores of leading medical
men have written enough to fill volumes
in praise of the curative value of the
several ingredients entering into these
well-known medicines.
Amongst theso writers we find such med-
ical lights as Prat Finlcy Ellintrwood, H. I).,
of Bennet Medical College. Chicago; Plot.
Hale, of the same city; Prof. John M. Scud-
don M. I)., late of Cincinnati, Ohio; Prof.
John Kins, M. D., late of Cincinnati, Ohio;
Dr. G>-OTr Coo. of New York; Dr. Bartho-
low. of Jefferson Medical College, of Pa.,
and scores of others equally eminent.

MICHAEL ANGELO.
The Homble Start In Life of the Fa-
m mous Master.
Two boys were herding swine In
Italy. They were evidently discussing
some very important subject, for they
were earnest at it. A man approach
ed, and the boys separated, each for
his own side of the pasture. The man
was angry nnd w;\s slinking bis hand
at them. The boys said nothing: they
drove their swine In and wore <iuiet as
a mouse about it. The man had said
they should stay out until dark, and
the sun had not even sot yet. After
they had driven tho swlno to their re
spective places each crept to his room,
took his clothes nnd tied them ta a
bundle. This done, they both crept
down and ran to the road which led
to ltomo, One's name was Peter; the
other Michael Angela Both were poor
boys. They tramped and tramped, and
the first thing .they did when they
reached Rome was to go to church.
After they had rested and prayed they
looked for employment. Peter received
employment as the cook's boy in some
cardinal's house, but Michael could
Qnil nothing to do, so he almost de
spaired.
lie went to his friend Peter, who
gave him something to eat a%d at
night secretly let him Into his room In
the attic to sleep, This went on for n
long time, Peter content to let his
friend do this and Michael content
also. Michael when in church had seen
some fine pictures. One which fasci
nated him was "Christ Ascending to
Heaven." Taking bits of charcoal, he
went to Peter's room aud drew pic
tures on the white walls. One day the
cardinal had occasion to go 4o the
room. Michael had meanwhile secured
employment in the cardinal's kitchen.
The cardinal, upon seeing all the pic
tures, was dumfounded with their
accurateness. He called Peter and
Michael upstairs and asked who had
drawn them. Michael confessed he
had, but said he thought he could rub
them out again. The cardinal explain
ed to him that it was all right so far
as the wall was concerned. He took
Michael and sent him to a drawing
master and gave Peter a better posi
tion. And Michael worked hard at his
drawings, learned diligently and be
came the renowned Michael Angelo,
one of the greatest painters of his
time.

BERNHARDT'S ART IN DRESS
GREAT SPLENDOR OF WARDROBE
OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST
ACTRESS.
Huch Study Given to Make Each
Gown Adaptable to the Part Pre
sented^—Artist's Taste and Genius
Very Evident.
What does Madame Bernhardt wear?
During her engagement in this coun
try, this question about the famous
actress was asked by every woman
unable to judge by seeing for herself,
and th.c reply is the Ue ghted ex
clamation:
"Her gowns are simply gorgeous —
they are a part of her."
In the many plays presented, Bern
hardt has au oppo unity of displaying
a great variety of dresses, and thou
sands of women who have packed the
large theatres at every performance
whereever she appeared, have stared
at them in wonder, recognizing not
only their perfect adaptation to the
part presented, but also how much of
Bernhardt's own taste and genius
there was in them.
HER GENIUS FOR "SIGN.
What Is it? The gift displayed in
this particular, is as characteristic of
the woman as any other of the count
less details which go to make her the
public idol of all lands. Even those
who did not understand the spoken
language of the play, were full well
able to comprehend that of the silk,
satin and lace facing them over the
flaming footlights. This artist has
demonstrated to thousands, tlwt a gown
may be superior in lines and construc
tion to the flimsy models sent over
each year from Paris for our slavish
following. Street clothes, of course,
demand a certain amount of conven
tionality, in order not to make the
wearer conspicuous, but since the
Bernhardt engagement in their respec
tive fashion centers, not a few devisers
of costumes have declared their inten
tion of taking indoor styles more ser
iously.
HER EXAMPLE FOLLOWED.
For those women whose incomes ad
mit of certain and extravagant expend
iture for clothes, It Is just now consid
ered wonderfully "smart" to furnish
their own dressmakers and tailors with
crater-color sketches of models, speci
illy drawn for them by famous artists,
:hese sketches being used solely for
heir own particular gowns. With the
:tage for a precedent, these fashionable
lames have found it convenient to
idopt Its methods. For those who can
lot indulge in this fad, theater-going

assumes an added phase of enjoyment
to womankind. Sara Bernhardt's crea
tions are curiously interesting from the
•olnt of view that they serve as an ad
rance courier of what may be accom
plished by women who effect the hour
flass figure as that demanded by fash
on purveyors. Her carriage is lofty,
ler chest is high, her waist line ample,
md her head well poised — quite the
reverse, you will observe from the
figure usually attributed to French
women. But how unfettered is Bern
lardt's every action, and how splendid
ler movements! In other words, she
has mastered so absolutely the art of
dressing well, that once clothed, she is
utterly oblivions of her adornments.
A UNIQUE INNOVATION.
Novel Indeed is the hip swathing of
ill Mme. Bernhardt's gowns and all
ler frocks are set up on classical lines.
rhe bodices show waist lines either

m her abdomen, preferably the latter

mie poise which every woman's better
The Amador Ledger.
nature knows to be its proper setting
for prolonged activity.
To demonstrate how Mme. Bern
hardt manages to make this audaci
ous deviation from fashion's dictates
attractive, it is well to say that ske
had specially designed a cuirass over
which she has her maid wind yards of
soft ribbon which is finally tied in front
with an ornamental bow and long
streamer ends. This style is especially
adapted to her, as it makes her appear
taller, a point well worthy of imitation!
On this particular gown the hip swath
ing ends in pailletted stole ends, drip
ping vith gold fringe. Her tiny feet
are encased in marvelously fitting slip
pers of cloth of gold.
WONDERFUL BREAKFAST ROBE.
The robe worn in the breakfast
scene in "Magda" is worthy of study.
It is a silver-encrusted lace creation
over pastel blue, set up with wide
shoulders and a swathing of pale blue
ribbon, ending in large rosettes with
stole ends in front. A uniq; but char
acter-lending touch is a miniature Em
pire stole — merely a patted line of
priceless sable, which gives the frock,
in its Empire draping, the much need
ed long straight lines from neck to
hem. The sleeves, too, which are lace
puffs, with forearms of transparent
lace, show pale blue bracelets at their
division, made visible only by the art
ist's gestures, a subtle touch, but very
pleasing.
COSTUMES WORN IN "CAMILLE."
Ravishing, indeed, are her "Camille"
dresses! The first mystery is in sil
ver strewn gauze, wrought with a lat
tice work of pink ribbon embroidery
near the flare at the foot, this outer
work of art being fashioned over let
tuce green satin souple. The hip
swathing and stole ends are in the
same tone, and she wears with extra
ordinary grace a frosty pelerine of pale
green chiffon, decorated with fetching
clusters of blush roses.
Another of the "Camille" frocks re
veals the French dressmaker's power
of detail. The material is lustrous
white satin, with raised embroidery in
variegated pink flowers with green
foliage — the corsage resplendent with
well set gems.
Another change to which she treats
her audience in "Camille" is a gorge

HER "ANGELO" COSTUME.
In "Angelo," Mme. Bernhardt's
dress, an Italian princess costume, is
fashioned from gorgeous gold brocade.
It is set up on short-waisted, half-fitted
bodice lines, witl- tl-.c long sweeping
folds of the skirt attached. The mater
ial is so draped as to present an unbro
ken straight front, from the tucker
decorated corsage to the foot line.
BeautifuMy adjusted leg-of-mutton
sleeves of gold brocade meet fitted fore
arm coverings of cloth of gold, the lat
ter extending in shaped circular flares,
well drawn down over the knuckles,
ending just a touch of ucbing to
soften the effect.
A classic drapery of gobelin blue
crepe, deftly touched with embroidery
of deeper tone, accentuates the beauty
of the ensemble. This cloak hangs in
long straight lines over the gown, be
ing but loosely caught together at the
sides with tapestry blue cords and tas
sels. With this is worn a dog collar of
pearls.
Other feminine accessories, quite out
of the ordinary, are the jewel-studded
cloth-of-gold chatelaine bag, suspended
on a long, dangling gold chain, and
several plain linked gold chains worn

JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY, CAL., JULY 13, 190 G.
JULY SECOND THE DAY
GOVERNMENT HISTORIAN SATS
REAL INDEPENDENCE IS NOT
THE FOURTH.
Colonies Made Declaration Against
England Previous to Drawing His
torical Paper-— Final Signing of
Document on August Second.
According to the opinions of the
latest historical authorities both the
school children of by-gone days and
those of the present time have been
taught Incorrectly as to the proper In
dependence day of the nation. No one
date seems to develop such excitable
emotions as does the mention of the
Fourth of July, but how unattractive
would it seem if we were to state that
the second of July is the day of fire
crackers, bombs and Roman candles.
And yet, according to Mr. William H.
Michael, Chief Clerk and Historian of
the Department of State,, "The real In
dependence Day is the second of July."
Since we bent over our childhood
histories we "have always had an idea
that our fathers severed the ties with
Great Britain on the Fourth of July,
1776, and we have had word of no less
an authority than Thomas Jefferson,
author of that hallowed instrument,
that the Declaration was signed on
that date, on whose anniversary the
great father of democracy died. But
Mr. Michael says no, and for years he
has toiled for his country beneath the
same roof which shelters the sacred
document; has had the nation's arch
ives at his fingers' ends.
INDEPENDENCE ON JULY 2.
"The independence of the United
States was declared by resolution on
the 2d of July, and the adoption of the
form of Declaration on the 4th of July
was a secondary matter," says Mr.
Michael. "It is a little strange that
more importance was not attached to
the 2d of July in connection with the
Declaration of Independence. ,The res
olution introduced by Richard Henry
Lee, was passed on that day (July 2,
1776). This was really the vital point
— the crucial juncture."
The real act of independence, which
Mr. Michael has had reproduced in fac
simile, was then the Lee resolution
declaring:
"That these United colonies are, and
of right ought to be, free and inde
pendent states; that they are absolved
from all allegiance to the British
Crown, and that all political connection
between them and the State of Great
Britain is, and ought to be, totally
dissolved."
SIGNED AUGUST 2.
Concerning the actual date of the
Declaration's signing, Mr. Michael
says: "Mr. Jefferson in hi 3 a^co;:nt
states that all the memter.3 prezent
except Mr. Dickinson, signed t'.:e Dec
laration in the evening of the Fourth
of July. The journal shows that no
one signed it that evening except Mr.
Hancock and Mr. Thomson. The
journal entry is: 'Signed, John Han
cock, President, Attest, Charles Thorn
son, Secretary.' * • * On August
2, the Declaration, as engrossed under
the order of Congress, was signed by
all of the members of Congress
present."
What really did happen on July 4,
of that year of years was the final
adoption of a draft of the "form of
announcing the fact to the world"
that independence had been decreed
two days before. Jefferson had writ.
ten this draft in his Philadelphia
apartments, consisting of a ready-fur
nished parlor and bedroom in the new
brick house of Hyman Gratz, at the
southwest corner of 7th and Market
streets, "on the outskirts of the city."
The Perm National Bank now occupy
ing the site of this dwelling, is in the
very business heart of Philadelphia.
WRITTEN LATE IN JULY.
But the "original Declaration," which
all pilgrims to Washington formerly
gazed upon in awe and reverence, was
not ordered written for more than two
weeks after that long but unjustly
hallowed July 4. On July 19, Con
gress ordered that the Declaration be
"fairly engrossed on parchment," and
that "the same, when engrossed, be
signed by every member of Congress."
Some time within the next^wo weeks
the beautiful pen work which thous
ands of Americans have since mar
veled at and admired was executed
upon the great strip of sheepskin now
locked away in the Department of
State at Washington.
On August 2, 1776, just a month
after the real stroke of independence
this great sheepskin was unrolled in
the presence of the Continental Con
gress, in Independence Hall, with the
wording of the corrected draft it was
carefully "compared at the table."
This formality gone through with,
it was spread out upon a desk and
signed by all of the members of Con
gress present. Fifty of these fathers
of the republic signed on that day.
Six of the revered "signers,, did not
affix their signatures until later dates
George Wythe of Virginia signed
about August 27. Richard Henry Lee.
Virginia: Eldridge Gerry. Massachu
setts, and Oliver Wolcott. Connecticut
did not sign until some time in Sen
tember. Matthv Thornton, of New
Hampshire, did not add his name until
November, and Thomas McKean of
Delaware, nrobably did not affix his.
the final signature, until five years
later, or 1781. Matthew Thornton,
by the way. was not appointed to Con
gress until September, and did not
take his seat until November — four
months after the adoption of the Dec
laration. Other signers who werp
not members of Congress on July ?
or 4, were allowed to sign on August
2, the general signing day. These
were Benjamin Rush, James Wilson,
George Ross, George Clymer and
George Taylor.
JULY FOURTH.
The Day of Days Among Uncle Sam's
Sailor Boys.
Uncle Sam makes the Fourth of
July a greater day among his sailors
than even Christmas. Indeed, it is
the greatest day for relaxation and
pleasure for Jackie in the whole year.
The early Secretaries of the navy
established the custom and it has been
almost religiously maintained invio
late through the long line of officials
who have succeeded them.
Independence day belongs to the
Jackie. His superiors recognize that
his life is in some respects a hard
one. To him is denied the ties of
family, the friendships and all the
other interests and diversions of life
that make up the landsman's existence,
so for this reason Uncle Sam believes
that his sailors should have as many
holidays as possible.
To make Independence Day the big
gest day of all is to give the day a
special significance which cannot fail
in some degree at least to carry its
lesson of patriotic duty to those who
serve the republic on the seas.
Hence commodores and captains
always plan to remain in port on
July 4. Then, after dressing ship, fir
ing the national salute, and brief patri
otic services, the day is given to the
men to enjoy as they see fit, discipline
being almost entirely relaxed. The
sports that attend the sailors on the
Fourth of July are of a varied char-
INDEPENDENCE HALL AT PHILADELPHIA.
acter. Our naval service has, of
course, become affected to a consider
able extent by the great outdoor move
ment that has converted Independence
Day into the greatest sporting carni
val of the year.
The Navy Department has wisely
encouraged this tendency,, and where
ever an open field is available, the
piece de resistance is a baseball game,
sometimes between rival nines picked
from members of the same ship,
oftener between "teams representing
different ships and in some extreme
cases between nines from separate
squadrons who happen to be in ren
dezvous near each other.
Then there are track and field
events. The fleet-footed wearers of
the blue show how fast they can
sprint. Now just what good this does
them in their developments as fighters
is not clear, for even had they the
instinct to flee and get over ground
faster than a Duffy it would do them
ho good at the moment when the prow
of the ship was heading for a moist,
trip to Davy Jones' Locker. However,
they run and throw weights, jump and
pole vault.
If no athletic field is available, then
the rivalry must be confined to aquatic
events, swimming and rowing races.
In extreme cases where it is not pos
sible to get ashore or the water con
ditions preclude rowing or swimming,
the Jackies test their prowess at box
ing, wrestling, fencing, dancing and
singing.
Then the ship's larder is drawn on
for such extra delicacies as trans
forms the regula- neal into a banquet
and Mr. Jackie cnvwls into his ham
mock with the comfortable feeling
that July Fourth is :. pretty big day
after all, and that he is glad to be
able to pass it in Uncle Sam's service.
Black Hair the Strongest.
Black hair is stronger than golden
tresses, and will sustain almost double
the weight. Recently a scientist found,
by experiment, that it is possible to
suspend a weight of four ounces Ijy a
single hair, provided the hair be black.
Blond hair will give way at weights
varying according to the tint. A yel
low hair will scarce support two ounces,
i brown will hold un three without
breaking, while one of a very dark
brown will s'lsts'n an additional half
ounce.

war- bow; yet I can make nothing of
this, nor read my own name.
"Why, it is written in the French
tongue," said Alleyne, "and in a right
clerkly hand. This is how it runs in
our speech: 'To the very powerful
and very honorable knight, Sir Nigel
Loring of Christchurch, from his very
faithful friend Sir Claude Latour,
captain of the White Company, chate
lain of Buscar, grand lord of Mont
chateau, and vassal to the renowned
Gaston, Count of Foix, who holds the
rights of the high Justice, the middle,
and the low."
"Look at that, now!" cried the bow
man in triumph. "That is just what
he would have said. You come with
me, mon gros Jean, and as to you,
little one, where did you say that you
journeyed?"
"To Minstead."
"Ah, yes! I know this forest-country
well. We shall travel round with you
tc Minstead, lad, seeing that it is little
out of our way."
As they passed the old church,
which stood upon a mound at the left
hand side of the village street, the door
was flung open, and a stream of wor
shippers wound down the sloping path,
coming from the morning mass.
Alleyne bent knee and doffed hat at
the sight of the open door; but ere he
had finished an Aye, his comrades were
out of sight round the curve of the
path, and he had to run to overtake
them.
"What!" he said, "not one word of
prayer before God's own open house?
How can ye hope for his blessing upon
the day?"
"My friend," said Hordle John, "I
have prayed so much during the last
two months, not only during the day,
but at matins, lauds, and the like,
when I could scarce keep my head
upon my shoulders for nodding, that I
feel that I have somewhat overprayed
myself."
"How can a man have too much re
ligion?" cried Alleyne earnestly. "It
is the one thing that availeth. A man
is but a beast as he lives from day to
day, eating and drinking, breathing
and sleeping. It is only when he
raises himself, and co.^erns himself
with the Immortal spirit within him,
that he becomes in very truth a man. I
Bethink ye how sad a thing it would !
be that the blood of the Redeemer
should be spilled to no purpose."
"Bless the lad. if he doth not blush
like any girl, and yet preach like tbe

archer.
"In truth I blushed that any one so
weak and so "nworthv as T =honl6" try
to teach another that which he finds
t so passing hard to follow himself."

The young clerk smiled at his

wished help," he said, "He could have
summoned legions of archangles from
heaven, so what need had He of your
poor bow and arrow? Besides, bethink
you of His own words— that those who

bfcause ye are the only two friends

when ye talk of taking me to Franc©,
y* do not conceive how useless I
should be to you, seeing that neither
by training nor by nature am I fitted
for the wars, and there seems to be
nought but strife in those parts."
"Bethink you again, mon ami,"
quoth Aylward, "that you might do
much good yonder, since there are
three hundred men in the Company,
and none who has ever a word at
grace for them, and yet the Virgin
knows that there was never a set of
men who were In more need of it.
Sickerly the one duty may balance the
other. Your brother hath done with
out you this many a year, and, as I
gather, he hath never walked as far
as Beaulieu to see you during all that
time, so he cannot be in any great need
of you."
"Besides," said John, "the Socman of
Minstead is a byword through the
forest, from Bramshaw Hill to Holmes
ley Walk. He is a drunken, brawling,
perilous churl, as you may find to your
cost."
"The more reason that I should
strive to mend him," quoth Alleyne.
"There is no need to urge me, friends,
for my own wishes would draw me to
France, and it would be a Joy to me
could I go with you. But Indeed and
indeed it cannot be, so here I take my
leave of you, for yonder square tower
amongst the trees upon the right must
surely be the church of Minstead and
I may reach it by this path through
the woods."
I "Well, God be with thee, lad!" cried
the archer, pressing Alleyne to his
heart. "I am quick to love, and quick
to hate, and 'fore God I am loath to
part. Yet it may be as well that you
should know whither we go. We shall
now journey south through the woods
until we come out upon the Christ
churoh road, and so onward, hoping
to-night to reach the castle of air
William Montacute, Earl of Salisbury,
of which Sir Nigel Loring is constable.
There we shall bide, and it is like
enough that for a month or more you
may find us there, ere we are ready
for our voyage back to France."
It was hard indeed for" Alleyne to
break away from these two new but
hearty friends, and so strong was the
ccmbat between his conscience and his
inclinations that he dared not look
round, lest his resolution should slip
away from him.
The path which the young clerk had
now to follow lay through a magnifi
cent forest of the very heaviest timber,
where the giant boles of oak and of
beech formed long aisles in every di
rection, shooting up their huge
branches to build the majestic arches
of Nature's own cathedral. It was
very still there in the heart of the
woodlands. The gentle rustle of the
branches and the distant cooing of
pigeons were the only sounds which,
broke in upon the silence, save that
once Alleyne heard afar off a merry
call upon a hunting bugle and the
shrill yapping of the hounds. He
pushed on the quicker, twirling his
staff merrily, and looking: out at every
turn of the path for some sign of the
old Saxon residence. He was suoHenly
arrested, however, by the appearance
of a wild-looking fellow armed with a
club, who sprang out from behind a
tree and barred his passage. He was
a rough, powerful peasant, with cap
and tunic of untanned sheepskin,
leather breeches, and galligaskins
round his legs and feet.
"Stand!" he shouted, raising hU
heavy cudgel to enforce the order.
"Who are you who walk so freely
throurh the wood?" Whither would
you go, and what is your errand?"
"Why should I answer your ques
tions, my friend?" said Alleyne, stand
ing on his guard.
"Because your tonsrue may save
ycur pate. What hast in the scrip?"
"Nought of any price."
"How can I tell that, clerk? L>et me
see.
"Not t"
"Fool! I could pu'l you limb from
limb Hke a pullet. Wouldst lose scrip
and life too?"
"I will part with neither without a
fight."
"A" fight, quotha? A light betwixtspurred cock and new-hatched chicken!
Thy fighting days may soon be over."
"Hadst asked me in the name of
charity I would have given freely!"
cried Alleyne. "As it stands, not one
farthing shall you have with my free
Will, and when I see my brother, the
Socman of Minstead, he will raise hue
and cry from vill to vill, from hundred
to hundred, until you are taken as a
common robber and a scourge to the
country."
The outlaw sank his club. "The
Socman's brother!" he gasped. "Now,
by the keys of Peter! I had rather
that hand withered and tongue was
palsied ere I had struck or miscalled
ycu. If you are the Socman's brother
you are one of the right side, I war
rant, for all your clerkly dress."
"His brother I am," replied Alleyne.
"But even if I were not, is that reason
why you should molest me on the
king's ground?"
"I give not the pip of an apple for
king or for noble," cried the serf
passionately. "11l have I had from
them, and 111 I shall repay them. lam
a good friend to my friends, and, by
the Virgin, an evil foeman to my foes."
"And therefore the worst of foeman
to thyself," said Alleyne. "But I pray
you, since you seem to know him, to
point out to me the shortest path to
my brother's house."
He was following the track, his mis
givings increasing with every step
whloh- took him nearer to that home
which he had never seen, when of a
sudden the trees began to thin and the
sward to spread out Into a broad green
low, where five cows lay in the sun
shine and droves of black swine wan
dered unchecked. A brown forest
stream swirled down the centre of this
clearing, with a rude bridge flung
across it, and on the other side was a
second field eloping up to a long, low
lying wooden house, with thatched roof
and open squares for windows. Al
leyne gazed across at It with flushed
cheeks and sparkling eyes — for this,
he knew, must be the home of his
fathers.
Alleyne was roused, however, from
his pleasant revery by the sound of
voiceß, and two people emerged from
the forest some little way to his right
and moved across the field In the di
rection of the bridge. The one was a
man with yellow flowing beard and
very long hair of the same tint droop
ing over his shoulders. By his side
walked a woman, tall and slight and
dark, with lithe graceful figure and
clear-cut, composed features. Her Jet-
"IF YOU LEAVE ME NOW, SHAME FOREVER UPON YOUR MANHOOD.
black hair was gathered back under a
light pink coif, her head poised proudly
upon her neck, and her step long and
springy, like that of some wild tireless
woodland creature. Alleyne stood In
the shadow of an oak staring at her
with parted lips, for this woman
seemed to him to be the most beauti
ful and graceful creature that mind
could conceive of. Such had he imag
ined the angels, but here there was
something human, which sent a tingle
and thrill through his nerves such as
no dream of radiant and stainless
spirit had ever yet been able to conjure
up.
The two walked swiftly across the
meadow to the narrow bridge, he In
frcnt and ahe a pace or two behind.
There they paused, and stood for a
few minutes face to face, talking
earnestly. Alleyne had read and
heard of love and of lovers. Such were
these, doubtless — thtSi golden-bearded
man and the fair damsel with the cold
proud face. Why else should they
wander together in the woods, or be so
lost in talk by rustic streams? And
yet as he watched, uncertain whether
to advance from the cover or to choose
some other path to the house, he soon
came to doubt the truth of his con
jecture. The man stood, tall and
square, blocking the entrance to the
bridge, and throwing out his hands as
he spoke in a wild, eager fashion,
while the deep tones of his stormy
voice rose at times- into accents of
menace and of anger. She stood fear
lessly in front of him, but twice she
threw a swift questioning glance over
her shoulder, as of one who is in
search of aid. So moved was the
young clerk by these mute appeals,
that he came forth from the trees and
crossed the meadow, uncertain what to
do, and yet loath to hold back from
one who might need his aid. So intent
were they upon each other that neither
took note of his approach; until, when
he was close upon them, the man threw
his arm roughly round the damsel's
waist and drew her toward him, she
straining her lithe supple figure away
and striking fiercely at him. The
maid, however, had but little chance
against her assailant, who, laughing
loudly, caught her wrist In one hand
while he drew her toward him with the
ether.
"The best rose has ever the longest
thorns," said he. "Quiet, little one, or
you may do yourself a hurt! Must pay
Saxon toll on Saxon land, my proud
Maude, for all your airs and graces."
"You boor!" she hissed. "You base,
underbred clod! Is this your care and
your hospitality? I would rather wed
a branded serf from my father's fields.
Leave go, I say — Ah, good youth,
Heaven has sent you. Make him loose
me! By the honor of your mother, I
pray you to stand by me and to make
" this knave loose me.
"Stand by you 1 will, and that
blithely," said Alleyne. "Surely, sir,
you should take shame to hold the
damsel against her will."
The man turned a face upon him
which was lion-like in its strength and
in its wrath. With his tangle of
golden hair, his fierce blue eyes, and
his large, well-marked features, he
was the most comely man whom Al
leyne had ever seen; and yet there was
something so sinister and so fell in his
expression that child or beast might
well have shrunk from him. His brows
were drawn, his cheek flushed, and
there was a mad sparkle in his eyes
which spoke of a wild, untamable
nature.
"Young fool!" he cried, holding the
woman still to his side, though «very
line of her shrinking figure spoke her
abhorrence. "I rede you to go on your
way, lest worse befall you. This little
wench has come with me, and with me
she shall bide."
"Liar!" cried the woman; and, stoop
ing her head, she suddenly bit fiercely
into the broad brown hand which held
her. He whipped it back with an oath,
while she tore herself free and slipped
behind Alleyne, cowering up against
him.
"Stand off my land!" the man
said fiercely, heedless of the blood
which trickled freely from his fingers.
"What have you to do here? By your
dress you should be one of those cursed
clerks who overrun the land like vile
rats, poking and prying into other
men's concerns, too caitiff to flght and
too lazy to work."
"Is this your land, then?" gasped
Alleyne.
"Would you dispute it, dog? Would
you wish by trick or quibble to juggle
me out of these last acres? Know,
base-born knave, that you have dared
this day to stand in the path of one
whose race have been the advisers of
kings and the leaders of hosts, ere ever
this vile crew of Norman robbers came
into the land, or such half-blood
hounds as you were let loose to preach
that the thief should have his booty
and the honest man should sin if he
strove to win back his own."
"You are the Socman of Minstead!"
"That I am; and the son of Edrlc
the Socman, of the pure blood of God
frey the thane, by the only daughter
of the house of Aluric, whose fore
fathers held the white-horse banner at
the fatal flght where our shield was
broken and our sword shivered. My
folk held this land from Bramshaw
Wood to the Ringwood road. Begone,
I say, and meddle not with my affair!"
"If you leave me now," whispered the
woman, "shame forever upon your
manhood!"
"Surely, sir," said Alleyne, speaking
In as persuasive and soothing a way
as he could, "If your birth Is gentle,
there is the more reason that your
manners should be gentle too. I am
well persuaded that you did but Jest
with this lady, and that you will now
permit her to leave your land either
alone or with me as a guide, if she
should need one, through the wood.
As to birth, it does not become me to
boast, and there is sooth in what you
say as to the unworthiness of clerks,
but it is none the less true that I am
as well born as you."
"Dog!" cried the furious Socman,
"there is no man in the south who can
say as much."
"Yet can I," said Alleyne, smiling;
"for indeed I also am the son of Edric
the Socman, of the pure blood of God
frey the thane, by the only daughter of
Aluric of Brockenhurst. Surely, dear
brother," he continued, holding out his
hand, "you have a warmer greeting
than this for me. There are but two
boughs left upon this old Saxon trunk."
His elder brother dashed his hand
aside with an oath, while an expression
of malignant hatred passed over his
passion-drawn features. "You are the
young cub of Beaulieu, then?" said he.
"I might have known it by the sleek
face and slavish manner, too monk
ridden and craven in spirit to answer
back a rough word. Thy father,
shaveling, with all his faults, had a
man's heart; and there were few who
could look him In the eyes on the day
of his anger. But you! Look there,
rat, on yonder field where the cows
graze, and on that other beyond, and
on the orchard hard by the church.
Do you know that all these were
squeezed out of your dying father by
greedy priests, to pay for your up
bringing in the cloisters! I, the Soc
man, am shorn of my lands that you
may snivel Latin and eat bread for
which you never yet did a hand's turn.
Knave, my dogs shall be set upon
you: but meanwhile, stand out of my
path, and stop me at your 1 peril!"
As he spoke he rushed forward, and,
throwing the lad to one side, caught
the woman's wrist. Alleyne, however,
as active as a young deer-hound,
sprang to her aid and seized her by
the other arm, raising his iron-shod
staff as he did so.
"You may say what you will to me,"
he said between his clenched teeth —
"it may be no better than I deserve;
but, brother or no, I swear by my
hopes of salvation that I will break
your arm if you do not leave hold of
the maid."
There was a ring in his voice and a
flash in his eyes which promised that
the blow would follow quick at the
heels of the word. For a moment the
blood of the long line of hot-headed
thanes was too strong for the soft
whisperings of the doctrine of meek
ness and mercy. He was conscious of
a fierce wild thrill through his nerves
and a throb of mad gladness at his
heart, as his real human self burst for
an instant the bonds of custom and of
teaching which had held it so long.
The Socman sprang back, looking to
It ft and to right for some stick or
stone which might serve him for
weapon; but finding none, he turned
and ran at the top of his speed for the
house, blowing the while upon a
shrill whistle.
"Come!" gasped the woman. "Fly,
friend, ere he come back."
They ran together to the cove- of the
woods. As they gained the edge of the
brushwood, Alleyne, looking back, saw
his brother come running out of the
house again, with the sun gleaming
upon his hair and his beard. He held
something which flashed in his ri :ht
hand, and he stopped to unloose the
black hound.
"This way!" the woman whispered,
in a low eager voice. "Through the
bushes to that forked ash. Do not
heed me; I can run as fast as you, I
trow. Now into the stream — right in,
over ankles, to throw the dog off. As
she spoke, she sprang herself into the
shallow stream and ran swiftly up the
centre of it, with the brown water
bubbling over her feet, and her hand
outstretched to ward off the clinging
branches of bramble or sapling Al
leyne followed close at her heels, with
his mind in a whirl at this black wel
come and sudden shifting of all his
plans and hopes. Yet, grave as were
his thoughts, they would still turn to
wonder as he looked at the twinkling
feet of his guide and saw her lithe
figure bend this way and that, dipping
under boughs, springing over stones,
with a lightness and ease which made
It no small task for him to keep up
with her. At last, when he was al
most out of breath, she suddenly
threw herself down upon a mossy bank,
between two holly-bushes, and looked
ruefully at her own dripping feet and
bedraggled skirt.
Alleyne, still standing In the stream,
glanced down at the graceful pink
and-white figure, the curve of raven
black hair, and the proud, sensitive
face, which looked up frankly and confi
dently at his own.
"Why did you not kill him?"
"Kill him? My brother?"
"And why not?" — with a quick gleam
of her white teeth. "He would have
killed you. I know him, and I read it
in his eyes. Had I had your staff I
would have tried — aye, and done It,
tco." She shook her clenched white
hand as she spoke, and her lips tight
ened ominously.
"I am already sad in heart for what
I have done," said he, sitting down on
the bank, and sinking his face into his
hands. "God help me! all that is
worst in me seemed to come upper
most. Another instant, and I had
smitten him: the son of my own
mother, the man whom I have longed
tc take to my heart. Alas! that I
should still be so weak."
"Weak!" she exclaimed, raising her
black eyebrows. "I do not think that
even my father himself, who is a hard
Judge of manhood, would call you that.
But it is, as you may think, sir, a very
pleasant thing for me to hear that you
are grieved at what you have done,
and I can but rede that we should go
back together, and you should make
your peace with the Socman by hand
ing back your prisoner. It is a sad
thing that so small a thing as a woman
should come between two who are o£
one blood."
Simple Alleyne opened his eyes at
this little spurt of feminine bitterness.
"Nay, lady," said he, "that were worst
of all. What man would be so caitiff
and thrall as to fail you at your need?
I have turned my brother against me,
and now, alas! I appear to have given
you offence also with my clumsy
tongue. But, indeed, lady, I am torn
botfc ways, and can scarce grasp in my
mind what it is that has befallen."
"Nor can I marvel at that," said she,
with a little tinkling laugh. "You
came in as the knight d.oes in the
Jongleur's romances, between dragon
and damsel, with small time for the
asking of questions. Come," she went
on, springing to her feet, and smooth
ing down her rumpled frock, "let us
walk through the shaw together, and
we may come upon Bertrand with the
horses. If poor Troubadour had not
cast a shoe, we should not have had
this trouble. Nay, I must have your
arm.
"You have no wish, then, to hear my
story?" said she at last.
'"Nay," said he eagerly, "I would fain
hear It."
"You have a right to know it, if you
have lost a brother's favor through it.
This man has been a suitor for my
hand, less as I think for my own sweet
sake than because he hath ambition,
and had it on his mind that he might
improve his fortunes by dipping into
ray father's strong-box — though the
Virgin knows that he would have
found little enough therein.
"But, to be brief over the matter,
my father would have none of his woo
ing, nor in sooth would I. On that he
ewore a vow against us. and as he is
known to be a perilous man, with
many outlaws and others at his back,
my father forbade that I should hawk
or hunt in any part of the wood to the
north of Christchurch road. As it
chanced, however, this morning my
little falcon was loosed at a strong
winged heron, and page Bertrand and
I rode on, with no thoughts but for the
sport, until we found ourselves in Min
stead woods. Small harm then, but
that my horse Troubadour trod with a
tender foot upon a sharp stick, rear
ing and throwing me to the ground.
Then away ran Troubadour, for belike
I spurred him in falling, and Bertrand
rode after him as hard as hoofs could
bear him. When I rose there was the
Socman himself by my side, with the
news that I was on his land, but with
so many courteous words besides, and
such gallant bearing, that he prevailed
upon me to come to his house for

hale me up to it."
"But your father?"
"Not one word shall I tell him.
Tou do not know him; but I can tell
you he is not a man to disobey as I
have disobeyed him. He would avenge
me, it is true, but it is not to him that
I shall look for vengeance. Some day,
perchance, in joust or in tourney,
some knight may wish to wear my
colors, and then I shall tell him that if
he does indeed crave my favor there is
■wrong unredressed, and the wronger
the Socman of Minstead. So my
knight shall find a venture such as
bold knights love, and my debt shall
be paid, and my father none the wiser,
and one rogue the less in the world."
Then down the glade there came a
little green-clad page with laughing
eyes, and long curls floating behind
him. He sat perched on a high bay
horse, and held on to the bridle of a
spirited black palfrey, the hides of both
glistening from a long run.
"I have sought you everywhere, dear
Lady Maude," said he, in a piping
voice, springing down from his horse
and holding the stirrup. "Troubadour
galloped as far as Holmhill ere I could
catch him. I trust that you have had
no hurt or scath?" He shot a
questioning glance at Alleyne as he
spoke.
"No, Bertrand," said she, "thanks to
this courteous stranger. And now,
sir," she continued, springing into her
saddle, "it is not tit that I should
leave you without a word more. You
have acted this day as becomes a true
knight. King Arthur and aU his
Table could not have done more. It
may be that, as some small return,
my father or his kin may have power
to advance your interest. He is not
rich, but he is honored and hath great
friends. Tell me what Is your purpose,
and see if he may not aid it"
"Alas, lady! I have now no purpose.
I have but two friends in the world,
and they have gone to Christchurch,
where it is likely I shall Join them."
"And where in Christchurch?"
"At the castle which is held by the
brave knight, Sir Nigel Loring, con
stable to the Earl of Salisbury."
To his surprise she burst out a
laughing, and spurring her palfrey,
dashed off down the glade, with her
page riding behind her. Not one word
did she aay, but aa she vanished amid
the trees she half turned in her saddle
and waved a last greeting. Long time
he stood, half hoping that she might
again come back to him; but the thud
of the hoofs had died away, and there
was no sound in all the woods but the
gentle rustle and dropping of the
leaves. At last he turned away and
made his way back to the highroad —
another person from the light-hearted
boy who had left it a short three
hours before.

four other concerns in the world com-
bined, and their coffee is the most uni-
form. Then the roasting.
" The Brazilian Ambassador tells me
that coffee-roasting is an art," was the
court testimony of a world famous chem-
ist. Where are artists more likely to find
employment— manipulating a little roast-
er or in the Arbuckle mills, where the
yearly roast amounts to the hundred
million pounds? 9
Don't take scoop coffee, but buy a
paokage of Arbuckles' ARIOSA. Take
it home and keep the bean intact until
ready to use. We hermetically seal each
bean after roasting with a coating of
fresh eggs and granulated sugar to close
the pores and preserve the flavor. A lit-
tle warming makes it easy to grind and
develops the flavor. Coffee deteriorates
if exposed to the air — it also collects
dust and absorbs impurities. That is
why you should " BEWARE OF THE
SCOOP."

Will Manufacture Own Pennies.
Uncle Sam will make his own pen
nies In future. The treasury has
taken over the business from private
concerns, which for many years manu
factured these small coins for the
government, and Intends for all time
to come to turn them out with its own
machinery.
The treasury has always stamped
Its own pennies with the design of the
Indian's head and the wreath on the
reverse enclosing the words "One
cent"; but the coins, lacking only this
finishing touch, have been made for
many years in Waterbury, Conn.,
whence they were shipped in the shape
of "blanks" (otherwise known as
"planchets") In strong wooden boxes.
They used to cost the government, In
this form, only twenty-four cents a
pound, whereas to-day, owing to the
rise In the price of copper, they can
not be manufactured, even when
homemade, for less than twenty-nine
cents. A pound of blanks represent
146 pennies.
If a cent a pound be added for the
erpense of stamping them with dies,
it will be obvious that Uncle Sam is
able to manufacture 486 pennies for
a dollar — a very profitable enterprise,
inasmuch as he disposes of that num
ber for $4.86.
During the last year the treasury
minted 80,719,103 pennies, of which
New York State absorbed about 15,
000,000, the demand from Illinois be
ing next in point- of size, while Massa
chusetts was third and Pennsylvania
fourth. To make this number of cents
required 525,228 pounds of copper,
1G,586 pounds of tin and 11,257 pounds
of zinc, the two latter metals entering
into the composition of these coins to
the extent of three per cent and two.

PATRIOTISM IS TIME OF PEACE
NhEDED TO SOLVE OUR
NATIONAL PROBLEMS.
We Must Plant Forests. Organize
Better Schools, Make Homes For
Workers and Rear the Children
Close to Nature. -Menace of Great
Cities.
At the commencement exercises of
the Michigan Agricultural College on
June 20th, 1900, an address was de
livered by George H. Maxwell. Dean
of the Homecrofters Gild of the Talis
man and Executive Chairman of the
National Irrigation Association.
The key-note of the address of Mr.
Maxwell was the idea that we should
bring to the constructive work of
our social and commercial life in time
of peace, the same fervent patriot
ism and devotion to the public serv
ice that would inspire the whole na
tion if we were in the throes of a
bloody conflict with the people of
some other country.
In Illustration of this he re
ferred to our forest resources.
The wasteful improvidence with
which we have swept the for
ests out of existence was contrasted
with the elaborate care with which
we have built fortifications and na
vies and equipped our armies. And
yet, said Mr. Maxwell, we have little
to fear from any foreign foe. But
we have much to fear from the
wreck and ruin that will inevitably
follow the destruction of our forests.
Destroy the forests and over im
mense areas flood and drouth will
destroy the farms.
Destroy the forests and you will at
the same time destroy many of our
most important industries by the ex
haustion of our supply of wood or
timber.
Destroy a city by bombardment or
fire and It can be rebuilt in a few
years more beautiful than ever.
Destroy a forest on the plains and
It may take more than a generation
to restore it
Destroy a forest on the mountains,
where the soil is thin and poor, and
it may take centuries to restore the
forest If it can ever be done at all.
The destruction of the forest cover
leaves the mountain sides so exposed
to erosion that the rocks are washed
"DEBTBOY THE FOREBTB AND FLOOD AND DBOUTH
WILL DESTROY THE FARMS."
bare of soil, and reforestation becomes
impossible
We are told by experts, and no one
contradicts the statement, that at the
present rate of consumption, our en
tire forest resources will be exhausted
In less than forty years. I have re
cently seen it stated at thirty-five
years. If we are to guard against
this national danger the Timber and
Stone Law must be repealed, and all
public timber lands Included in perm
anent Forest Reserves, the title to the
land forever retained by the National
Government, stumpage only of ma
tured timber sold, and young timber
preserved for future cutting, so that
the forests will be perpetuated by
right use; and the National Govern
ment must, by the reservation or pur
chase of existing forest lands, and the
planting of new forests, create in
every state National Forest Planta
tions from which, through all the
years to come, a sufficient supply of
wood and timber can be annually
harvested to supply the needs of the
people of each state from the Forest
Plantations in that state.
Unless we take time by the fore
lock the next generation will see the
United States practically a treeless
nation, withont wood or timber for
the uses of our people, and devastated
year after year by ruinous - oods. Al
ready the scarcity of timber is being
felt and every man who builds a
home must pay the increased cost. In
Michigan I understand that some of
your most important industries are
crippled by the shortage of timber.
And yet, in the face of this con
dition which Is nothing more than a
crisis threatening the complete de
struction of one of our greatest re
sources as a nation, Congress busies
itself with a multitude of matters of
infinitely less importance and refuses
to repeal the Timber and Stone Act,
under which the last remnants of our
unreserved national forest lands are
being fed into the insatiable maw of
the timber speculators for less than
one-tenth of their actual value.
We are told by the men in Congress
who make Committees and shape leg
islation that the money cannot be
spared to acqulfc and save from de
struction the Calaveras Big Trees in
California, or to create the White
Mountain and Appalachian Forest Re
serves, and preserve their forest re
sources and save the water power
used in the manufacturing industries
of New England and the South; and
the same men in the same moment re
fuse to stop the most shameless waste
of a nation's resources that ever dis
graced a national lawmaking body by
refusing to repeal the Timber and
Stone Act.
Not only this, but in Arizona and
New Mexico where the forests are the
very life of the country, the joint
Statehood Bill proposed to give a float
ing grant of several million acres
which the land speculators who would
control the legislature would use to
get control of and destroy every acre
of unreserved timber land in those
territories. The country owes a debt
of gratitude to Senator Burroughs of
your State for his aid in preventing
that bill from passing the Senate.
It seems incredible that these
things should be done by Congress,
but there are reasons for it.
In the first place the people at
large take no interest in the preserva
tion of their own property.
"What is everybody's business is
nobody's business."
In the second place we have not
yet, as a people, risen far enough
above the mere worship of Mammon to
realize that we are deliberately sac
rificing to the Golden Calf the re
sources without which we cannot es-
Ist as a nation.
And worse than this, we are crowd-
Ing our working people, both native
and foreign born, into an environment
where congestion of population is de
generating our workers and rotting
their physical nnd moral fibre.
Where will you find any citizenship
in the slum and tenement districts
of our cities to whom you can effect
ively appeal for help to stop the waste
of our forests? They know nothing
about It and care less. The first need
of any nation is an Intelligent citizen
ship, and the slums and tenements of
our great cities are maelstroms Into
which the citizenship of the country
Is being drawn to its destruction in a
steadily Increasing volume.
We are suffering just now from a
spasm of national hysteria because
what everybody who ever took the
trouble to go and look knew long ago
— the revolting conditions under
which the great packers of Chicago
have been operating their plants, and
because diseased meat has been sold
for food.
But you may draw the worst pict
ure that your Imagination can paint
of the horrors of the slaughtering and
packing of meat in those establish
ments , and nothing you can imagine
equals the horror of blighting the
lives of thousands of children who
are condemned to live and grow up In
tue foul physical, social and moral
miasma that permeates the whole
slum district of Packingtown. It Is
a national disgrace and is bound to
prove a national curse.
There Is only one remedy for those
1
horrible conditions of life for the
children, and that is to get the work
ing people and their children out of
the slums, and into the suburbs
where they can have sunshine and
fresh air and pure and nourishing
food from a home garden.
Let us realize once for all that this
problem of the children of our work-
Ing people is our greatest national
problem and go at its solution with
the same patriotic and self-sacrific
ing national heroism that led the
Homecrofters of Japan to go into bat
tle with their lives in their hands, like
hand grenades, to throw at the enemy
that sought to crush out their na
tional life
Let us catch the Inspiration of the
slogan of the Homecraft ers' Move
ment In this Country, and never cease
our work until we have
"Every child in a garden — Every
Mother in a Homecraft — and Individ
ual Industrial Independence for
Every Worker in a Home of his own
on the Land."
The Creed and Platform of the
Homecrofter tells how it may be done
and anyone who wants a copy of it
can get it without charge by sending a
postal card addressed to me, at the
Fisher Building in Chicago.
The Great Cities are our most
serious menace in this Country. Our
greatest national danger lies in the
Centralization of wealth and popula
tion and trade and industry. The
hope of the nation is in the farm and
suburban home and in the country
and suburban town and village.
Let us go seriously to work to cre
ate and upbuild them. Let every
student who goes out from this
splendid Institution go with the spirit
of a soldier to fight the great battles
of peace for higher national ideals,
for a purer public service, for the
preservation of our national resources,
for a better educational system, and
above and beyond all for the multipli
cation of Homes on the Land where
the children can grow to manhood
and womanhood In the uplifting en
vironment of a rural community
where the evil influences of the cities
can be forever kept at bay. In such
an environment children can be
reared to citizenship next to Nature
from whence they can draw health
and vigor both moral and physical for
the discharge of all the duties of life.
It is not in the cities that this country
now needs the service of the flower of
its patriotic manhood. It is in the
country where the great national
problem of the Improvement of the
rural life is to be solved, where more
beautiful towns and villages and bet
ter roads are to be built, better
schools to be established, telephones
and trolley lines constructed, and all
the influences put to work that will
socialize the country, and drive away
the isolation and hardships that were
formerly its drawbacks.
We must not only stop and reverse
the great tide of population that has
been drifting from the country to the
cities. We must decentralize industry
and trade as well as population. The
pariotism that is latent in every
heart must find an outlet in every
country town and village in the work
of village improvement, of creating an
environment for human life where
the highest utility and beauty will
surround the entire community, and
where a local civic loyalty will prevail
that will anchor the people to their
own hearthstone and where they will
live content under their own vine and
fig tree.
This local pride and love of home
and the home town is one of the
strongest of human feelings when
once It is deeply planted. It should
be cultivated In every possible way.
Nothing should be left undone to
stimulate or cement It. Every member
of such a community should cultivate
a spirit of comradeship and co-operate
to advance the general welfare of all.
The merchant, the small tradesman,
the country editor, the Church, should
all work together to that end.
Home Industry should be aneonraged
In every possible way. The whole
community should co-operate to pro
tect and stimulate the trade of the
town.
The home paper should be liberally
patronized. There Is no one thing
capable of more far reaching and en
during influence for good than the
country press. One of the most un
fortunate of modern influences has
been the tr*nd of commercial evolu
tion that has borne so heavily on the
country editor by the development of
the metropolitan family monthly and
mall order papers, filled with tempt
ation for the rural people to stimulate
the centralization of wealth and trade
in the cities by supplying their ordin
ary needs from far distant and prac
tically unknown sources. This trend
toward the centralization of trade
and Industry in the great cities walks
side by side with the centralization of
wealth and population as a menace to
our national future. The danger it
threatens can only be obviated by
awakening the people at large to a re
alization of it.
The great central and controlling
thought that must rise above all
others as a national ideal Is the con
viction that the real bulwarks of the
nation are the Homes of its Citizens
and that the first thought and highest
ambition of every young man should
be to establish a HOME, a self-sus
taining Home on the Land, where he
can be independent and enjoy the real
happiness of a well spent life and not
make the mistake that brings dissap
pointment and misery to so many, of
setting up the accumulation of a for
tune as the goal of his life's ambition!
It is a lure which of necessity must
wreck thousands in order that a few
may succeed. The man who earns
enough to live comfortably without
luxury, as every intelligent and in
dustrious man can who has sufficient
practical education, and who does
his duty to himself, his family, his
friends, his country and to humanity,
Is the man who really succeeds In life
and who gets the greatest happiness
and satisfaction out of it.
To create a human character of the
highest type with everything that
implies, Is the most admirable of all
human achievments and that every
man and woman must and can do for
themselves.
"A . time like this demands strong men,
Great hearts, true faith and ready hands;
Men whom the lust of office docs not kill.
Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy,
Men who posses.* opinion and a will.
Men who have honor, men who will not
He,
Men who can stand before a demagogue.
And damn his treacherous flatteries with
out winking;
Tall men, Bun-crowned, who lire above the
tog.
In public duty and In private thinking."
FOR THE TOWN BEAUTIFUL.
Missouri Women Begin Campaign
for Gleaner Cities and Villages
(Columbia Herald.)
The club women of Missouri have
taken up in earnest the campaign for
cleaner cities and towns. In St
Joseph and other large towns organ
izations of women have done much to
promote a general sentiment for clean
liness and are planning more. In Ma
con a women's organization virtually
manages the street cleaning depart
ment, collects the money from mer
chants, superintends the work and
disburses the funds. The members of
the club at Trenton, a women's club,
ha,ve started a campaign that is being
watched with interest and imitated in
other towns. At the annual meeting
at the home of their president, Mrs.
T. N. Witten, the club discussed plans
for the promotion of a sentiment for
better care of lawns and gardens,
cleaner streets and i-lleys and general
improvements. The subject of the
opening paper of the meeting, read by
Mrs. J. A. Asher, was this appropriate
one: "The Town's Opportunity — How
Can It Do More Than the City for a
Beautiful 'merican Life?" One of
the plans decided upon was to offer
cash prizes to children in the various
wards of Trenton for the best show
ings under prescribed conditions, in
the growing of flowers and care of
premises. Seeds for the competitor-,
are to bs furnished practically free by
the club. The mayor was asked to
Issue a proclamation for a neral
cleaning-up day, asking citizens to de
vote a few hours systematically to dis
posing of the accumulated rubbish.
What the women are doing in some
Missouri towns the school children
have been urged to undertake in others.
At various ward schools of .Toplin the
pupils assisted in the cleaning up of
the grounds in readiness fi tl.e lant
ing of shrubs and flowers. At Perry,
in Rails County, where Professor J.
F. Osborne has the prettiest public
school campus in the state, the school
children helped in the good work. At
Joplin Principal S. A. Baker has been
a leader In the observance of Arbor
day and the inculcation of the senti
ment for the civic beauty.
A town must first be built in t 9
wilderness and then made beautiful.
The Missouri wilderness has gone, the
towns are here and are now bein^
made beautiful.

This book is the first of a Series
that will Chronicle the Progress of the
HOMECROFT MOVEMENT,
and Inform all who wish to co-operate
with it how they may do so through
the formation of local Homecrofters'
Circles, Clubs or Gilds to promote
Town and Village Betterment, stimu-
late home civic pride and loyalty to
home institutions, industries and trade,
improve methods and facilities of edu-
cation in the local public schools, and
create new opportunities "At Home"
that will go far to check the drift of
trade and population to the cities.
The first Gild of the Homecroftera
has been established at Watertown,
Massachusetts. The Gildhall, Shops
and Gardens are located at 143 Main
Street, where the Garden School is
now fully organized and over one
hundred children are at work In the
Gardens. The departments for train-
ing in Homecraft and Village Indus-
tries are being installed. The Weavers
are already at work at the looms.
It is not designed to build here an
isolated Institution, but to make a
model which can be duplicated in any
town or village in the country.

There is New Hope and Inspiration
for every Worker who wants a Home
of his own on the Land in the
CREED AND PLATFORM OF THE
HOMECROFTERS' which Is as fol-
lows:
"Peace has her victories no less re-
nowned than war."
EDUCATION
CO-OPERATION
OPPORTUNITY
HOMECROFTS
We believe that the Patriotic Slogan
of the Whole People of this Nation
should be "Every Child in a Garden —
Every Mother in a Homecraft — and In-
dividual Industrial Independence for
Every Worker in a Home of his Own
on the Land," and that until he owns
such a Home, the concentrated purpose
and chief inspiration to labor in the life
of every wage worker should be his
determination to "Get an Acre anj
Live on It."
We believe that the Slums and
Tenements and Congested Centers of
population in the Cities are a savagely
deteriorating social, moral and polit-
ical influence, and that a great public
movement should be organized, and
the whole power of the nation and
the states exerted for the betterment
of nil the conditions of Rural Life, and
to create and upbuild Centers of So-
cial and Civic Life in Country and
Suburban Towns and Villages, where
Trade and Industry can be so firmly
anchored that they cannot be drawn
into the Commercial Maelstrom that
is now steadily sucking Industry and
Humanity into the Vortex of the
Great Cities.
We believe that every Citizen In
this Country has an inherent and
Fundamental Right to an Education
which will train him to Earn a Liv-
ing, and, If need be, to get his living
straight from Mother Earth; and that
he has the same right to the Opportun-
ity to have the Work to Do which will
afford him that living, and to earn not
only a comfortable livelihood, but
enough more to enable him to be a
Homecrofter and to have a Home of
his Own, with ground around it
sufficient to yield him and his family
a Living from the Land as the reward
for his own labor.
We believe that the Public Domain
is the most precious heritage of the
people, and the surest safeguard the
nation has against Social Unrest Dis-
turbance or Upheaval, and that the
Cause of Humanity and the Preserva-
tion of Social Stability and of our Free
Institutions demand that the absorp-
tion of the public lands into specula-
tive private ownership, without settle-
ment, be forthwith stopped: and that
the nation should create opportunities
for Homecrofters by building irriga-
tion and drainage works to reclaim
land as fast as it is needed to give
every man who wants a Home on the
Land a chance to get it.
We believe that, as a Nation, we
should be less absorbed with Making
Money, and should pay more heed to
raising up and training Men who will
be Law- Abiding Citizens; that the wel-
fare of our Workers is of more con-
sequence than the mere accumulation
of Wealth; and that Stability of Na-
tional Character and of Social and
Business Conditions is of greater im-
portance to the people of this country
as a whole than any other one ques-
tion that is now before them; and we
believe that the only way to Preserve
such Stability, and to Permanently
Maintain our National Prosperity, is
to carry Into immediate effect and
operation the Platform of the Talis-
man, which is as follows;
EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT AND
HOMES ON THE LAND.
1. That children shall be taught
gardening and homecraft In the public
schools, and that Homecraft and
Garden Training Schools shall be
established by county, municipal,
state, and national governments,
where every boy and every man out
of work who wants employment where
he can gain that knowledge, can learn
how to make a home and till the soil
and get his living straight from the
ground, and where every boy would
be taught that his first aim in life
should be to get a home of his own
on the land.
BUILD HOMECROFTS AS NATION-
AL SAFEGUARDS.
2. That the New Zealanu system of
Land Taxation and Land Purchase
and Subdivision, and Advances to Set-
tlers Act, shall be adopted in this
country, to the end that land shall be
subdivided into small holdings in the
hands of those who will till it for a
livelihood, and labor find occupation
in the creation of homecrafts, which
will be perpetual safeguards against
the political evils and social discontent
resulting from the overgrowth of
cities and the sufferings of unem-
ployed wage-earners.
PROTECTION FOR THE AMER-
ICAN HOMECROFT.
3. That Rural Settlement shall be
encouraged and the principle of Pro-
tection for the American Wageworker
and bis Home applied directly to the
Home by the Exemption from Taxa-
tion of all improvements upon, and
also of all personal property, not ex-
ceeding $2,500 in value, used on and
in connection with, every Homecraft
or Rural Homestead of not more than
ten acres in extent, which the owner
occupies as a permanent home and
cultivates with his own labor and so
provides therefrom all or part of the
support for a family.
ENLARGEMENT OF AREA AVAIL-
ABLE FOR HOMEMAKING.
4. That the National Government,
as part of a comprehensive nation-
al policy of internal improvements
for river control and regulation,
and for the enlargement to the
utmost possible extent of the
area of the country available for agri-
culture and Homes on the Land, and
for the protection of those Homes from
either flood or drouth, shall build not
only levees and revetments where
needed, and drainage works for the
reclamation of swamp and overflowed
lands, but shall also preserve existing
forests, reforest denuded areas, plant
new forests, and build the great reser-
voirs and other engineering works
necessary to safeguard against over-
flow and save for beneficial use the
flood waters that now run to waste.
RECLAMATION AND SETTLE-
MENT OF THE ARID LANDS.
5. That the National Government
shall build the irrigation works neces-
sary to bring water within reach of
settlers on the arid lands, the cost of
such works to be repaid to the govern-
ment by such settlers in annual in-
stallments without interest, and that
the construction of the great irrigation
works necessary for the utilization of
the waters of such large rivers as the
Columbia, the Sacramento, the Colo-
rado, the Rio Grande, and the Missouri.
and their tributaries, shall proceed as
rapidly as the lands reclaimed will be
utilized in small farms by actual
settlers and homemakers, who will re-
pay the government the cost of con-
struction of the irrigation works, and
that the amount needed each year for
construction, as recommended by the
Secretary of the Interior, shall be
made available by Congress as a loan
from the general treasury to the Re-
clamation Fund, and repaid from
lands reclaimed, as required by the
National Irrigation Act.
SAVE THE PUBLIC LANDS J!O»
HOMEMAKERS.
6. That not another acre of the pub-
lic lands shall ever hereafter be
granted to any state or territory for
any purpose whatsoever, or to any one
other than an actual settler who baa
built his home on the land and lived
on it for five years, and that no more
land scrip of any kind shall ever be
issued, and that the Desert Land Law
and the Commutation Clause of the
Homestead Law shall be made to con-
form to the recommendations of the
Public Lands Commission appointed
by President Roosevelt and of the
Message of the President to Congress.
PLANT FORESTS AND CREATE
FOREST PLANTATIONS.
7. That the Timber and Stone Law
«liall be repealed, and that all pub-
lic timber lands shall be included in
permanent Forest Reserves, the title
to the land to be forever retained by
the National Government, stumpage
only of matured timber to be sold,
■ind young timber to be preserved for
future cutting, so that the forests will
be perpetuated by right use; and
that the National Government shall,
by the reservation or purchase of ex-
isting forest lands, and the planting
of new forests, create in every state
National Forest Plantations from
which, through all the years to come,
a sufficient supply of wood and timber
can be annually harvested to supply
the needs of the people of each state
from .he Forest Plantations in that
state.
CONTROL AND USE OF THB
GRAZING LANDS.
8. That all unlocated public lands
not otherwise reserved shall be re-
served from location or entry under
any law except the Homestead Law,
and shall be embraced in Grazing Re-
serves under the control of the Secre-
tary of Agriculture, who shall be em-
powered to Issue annual Licenses to
graze stock In said Grazing Reserves,
but such licenses shall never be Issued
for a longer period than one year on
agricultural lands or five years on
grazing lands, and all lands classified
as grazing lands shall be subject to
reclassiflcation at the end of every five
years; that no leases of the public
grazing lands shall ever be made by
the National Government, and that
the area of the homestead entry shall
never under any circumstances be en-
larged to exceed 160 acres.
RESERVE STATE LANDS FOR
HOMESTEAD SETTLERS.
9. That the public land states shall
administer the state lands under a
system similar to and in harmony
with the national public land system
above outlined, and that each state
shall enact a State Homestead Law
for the settlement of lands owned by
the state, and that state lands shall
be disposed of only to actual settlers
under such law, and that all state
lands shall at all times remain open
to Homestead Entry.

AND WATER.
10. That it shall be the law of every
state and of the United States, that
beneficial use Is the basis, the meas-
ure, and the limit of all rights to
water, including riparian rights, and
that the right to the use of water for
irrigation shall Inhere In and be ap-
purtenant to the land Irrigated, so that
the ownership of the land and the
water shall be united, and no right to
water as a speculative commodity
ever be acquired, held or owned.
RIGHT OF APPROPRIATION FOR
BENEFICIAL USE.
11. That it shall be the law of every
state and of the United States, that

shall give priority of right, through-
out the entire course of the stream,
without regard to state lines, and
that In each drainage basin the Irrl-
gators therein shall control the distri-
bution of the water.
A Homeerotl Garden.
The Homecraft Movement is grow
ing in strength and many leading
newspapers are editorially advocating
the idea that every family, though
living in the city, ought to have a
garden. A reader of MAXWEL '8
HOMEMAKER MAGAZINE, in
Westbranch, lowa, sends us the fol
lowing editorial clipped from the Dcs
iloines Daily News, which is so fully
in harmony with what this magazine
stands for that we take pleasure in
reproducing the same. The editor of
the News says:
A little garden, if properly cared
for, will save the city dweller many a
dollar.
But that is by no means the chlefest
pood. Even if he has more money
than he knows what to do with he
will still find rich profit in wielding
the spade and hoe for exercise. And
the rarest pleasure comes from follow
ing the primal instincts of nature.
It is not alone the plants and flowers
we long for.
An inner something Impels us to put
our hands at work in ti-j earth, to
bathe our bodies in the sunshine and
to open our souls in devotion to things
that are not gross, but sweet and
pure.
To be pitied Is t c man who <7oes
not drink in with delight t c fragrance
of the dowers after having breathed
all day the stench of a city, and who
does not learn a lesson from the noise
less, orderly, beneficent processes of
nature that are constantly going on
around him.
Every city dweller who has a bit of
ground ought to have a garden.
It may be only five feet square, but
he can plant it in treen peas, succulent
onions, radishes or lettuce, and still
find room for a flower or two to throw*
a little color and a little fragrance into
his life.
There are . any reasons, economical*
physical, esthetic and moral, why
every man should be his own gar
dener, if he can.
Thousands of dwelkrs in hotels,
flats and tenements can't be. Their
existence is as dull and cheerless In

is that of a bird that is caged.

: .- ■ (Sew York World.)
llt is literally the truth that the pack-
e ers treat their men like dogs. There
iis no place in all Packingtown where
tthe slightest consideration is shown
ffor a human being. They are com
pelled to be on hand at a certain hour
lln the morning, even though there is
n no killing to be done; they are laid oft
w without the slightest ceremony, and
t they have no idea when the work will
s start up again. They are cheated out
of their pay most ; shamelessly; If
enough men happen to be on hand the
bosses will start them up. before the
whistles blow, and cheat them that
way. If they are working overtime
and do not make a full hour, even
though they fail by only five minutes,
they get nothing for it. If any error
is made in the computation of their
work they have no redress; there is
always one answer to every complaint:
"If you do not like it you can go else
where."
ONE VAST TRUST.
The conditions in Packingtown have
reached their present state of degrad
ation by the natural process of com
petition, or rather, there is competi
tion of labor while there is no competi
tion of capital.. There is but one
vast employing trust and a body of
absolutely unorganized and helpless
types Of human beings are coming
there. There has been a regular pro
cession of the races through Packing
town; the industry was founded by
skilled cattle butchers from Germany;
then they began the importing of Irish
men. After the strike of 1894 they set
to work deliberately to crowd the labor
market so as to prevent further trou
bles; first they brought Poles, then
Bohemians, then Lithuanians, and now
finally Slovaks. These are nearly all
undersized, wretched people who can
not speak English, and who impress
one as having no more intelligence
than a dumb animal. The bosses beat
them and kick them and spit in their
faces. I saw sights of this sort which
fairly made my blood boil. I saw a
poor, wretched Lithuanian pushing a
truck in one of Swift & Co.'s cellars;
it was loaded with hams, and the poor
fellow was scarcely able to stir it on
the level floor. He came to a slight
incline and could not get it up, and the
boss fell upon him and pounded him
out of the place. I presume that he
was "firing" him. Another and
stronger man took his place.
COMPELLED TO VISIT SALOONS.
One of the things pointed out in the
President's report is that the men are
provided with no places to eat It is
difficult to imagine what this means in
the winter time. I saw them crouching
in the stairways of the packing
houses and outside under the sheds to
get away from the falling snow. In
conversation with one of the packers
I spoke of the horribly low wages that
were paid to the men, and he answered
that there was no use in paying any
more, because the balance went to the

saloon keeper. My reply was that for
one thing I had observed that the com
panies pay their men in checks, and
that saloons are the most convenient
places in which these can be cashed;
and that also as a consequence of the
lack of dining-rooms the men are liter
ally compelled to resort to the saloons
In winter. The packer then dropped
the subject.
Prior to the last strike in Chicago
the union officers made a computation,
based upon ten thousand time rtiocks,
and found that the average weekly
wage in Packingtown was between $5
and $6; since the strike, conditions
have of course grown worse. A friend
of mine who has recently been making
investigations for me stated that he
stood in a saloon on a Saturday night
and gathered up the pay envelopes of
the men as they came in and got their
checks cashed. He collected over a
score, and the average was less than
$4- there were some as low as $1.70
This represented a week's wages for an
able-bodied man in Packingtown at a
dull season.
FROM THE BEEF TRUST REPORT.
Extract From Neitl-Reynolds Docu
ment Which the President Sent
to Congress.
"An absence of cleanliness was found
everywhere In the handling of meat
being prepared for the various meat
food products. • * *
"As an extreme example of the en
tire disregard on the part of employes
of any notion of cleanliness in handling
dressed meat, we saw a hog that had
just been killed, cleaned, washed, and
started on Its way to the cooling room
tall from the sliding rail to a dirty
wooden floor and slide part way into
a filthy men's toilet. It was picked up
by two employes, placed upon a truck,
carried into the cooling room and hung
up with other carcasses, no effort being
made to clean It • • •
"In another establishment, equally
well known, a long table was noted
covered with several hundred pounds
of cooked scraps of beef and other
meats. Some of these meat scraps were
dry, leathery, and unfit to be eaten;
and in the heap were found pieces of
pig-skin, and even some bits of rope
strands and other rubbish. Inquiry
evoked the frank admission from the
man in charge that this was to be
ground up and used in making 'potted
ham.' "
Home-made Bone Fertiliser.
Everyone with a large garden has an
out-of-the-way place for fertilizers
where a "bone barrel" could be placed.
To reduce bones to fertilizer without
the use of acids takes time, but for
the home garden it is well worth wait
ing for. Put in a barrel three or four
inches of soil, then a closely packed
layer of bones, broken up somewhat,
and cover these with wood ashes and
wet with liquid manure from the

stables, if possible, or with plain water
strengthened with 10 cents ■\rorth
of washing ammonia. Repeat the
layers as there are bones enough until
the barrel is full. Cover with soil,
rounding the surface, and sow with
clover or grass seed, or plant the top
with some plant that will knit the soil
together as a cover, that will not let
through much moisture. In a year's
time empty the barrel, spade the con
tents together, make into a heap, and
let it stand for a month, then use as
wanted.

Some time since we published an
article on poultry growing North and
West, and referred to the large num
ber of fowls that are grown upon the
wheat fields of the Northwest and
which are purchased and shipped in to
the big packing establishments of
Kansas City and other western centres.
The packers of the west have estab
lished enormous finishing plants, as
they are called, for the feeding, fat
tening and preparing of poultry of all
kinds for market The fowls here are re
ceived in large numbers, placed in
coops that hold from three to five
birds, according to their size, and are
"trough-fed" — that is, they are fed a
mixture of ground meals properly pre
pared in troughs, and permitted to
eat as much as they will consume,
from three to five times per day.
Poultry crate-fattened in this way
will continue to eat well and thrive
from nine to twelve days. So soon as
they cease to feed themselves raven
ously from these troughs, what is
known as the cramming machine is
brought into service. Th" manipulator
of the cramming machine must have
experience in the handling and feed
>ing of the fowls in this way. The
cramming machine is composed Of a
feed trough or chamber placed upon
the top of a three-legged, movable
table, as it might be called, with a
plunger in the top, placed there after
the cylinder is filled with the properly
prepared food, and with the pressure
of the foot upon the lever, the food is
forced through the tube into the crop
of the fowl.
THE CRAMMER IS AN EXPERT.
The operator in charge of the cram
ming machine has several assistants
who bring the fowls from the coop to
him; he placing the tube down the
throat beyond the windpipe towards
the crop, nils the same by a pressure
of the foot, always gauging the amount
forced into the crop by the hand
pressure upon it
This manner of feeding is carried on
for a sufficient number of days to
make the entire period of feeding from
19 to 21 days. An experienced handler
knows just the time when the fowls
are finished ready for killing. When
tills time arrives, they are speedily
killed, dry-picked, and placed in proper
condition for market.
The food made use of for this pur
pose is a mixture of meals of several
kinds, to conform to the requirements
of the market Ground oats, corn
and middlings, mixed with boiled
milk or water Into a very dry mash
or mixed food is made use of for the
first 12 to 14 days for trough feeding.
During this period, the fowls have
grit and plenty of water to drink
where they can help themselves. So
soon as they show a disposition to
stop feeding themselves, all the food,
water and grit is removed from the
trough, and the stuffing machine is
brought into service. The same meals
mixed Into a gruel are used for this
purpose, the food forced into the crop

fluid condition, and no water or grit
whatever is given to the fowls daring
this period, the semi-liquid food fur
nishing sufficient moisture for the
greatest improvement.
GREAT GAIN IN WEIGHT AND
QUALITY.
Fowls that are fed In this way gain
largely in weight For instance, a
fowl placed in the coop weighing three
pounds and a quarter, bones, feathers
and offal, would weigh from one and
a half to two pounds more when fin
ished, adding in this way two pounds
of edible meat to the carcass, and so
Improving the entire carcass as to add
from three to fbur cents per pound to
Its value over that of poultry of that
kind not so well finished. Thus, a fowl
weighing three pounds and a quarter,
worth 9 cents per pound, would sell for
thirty cents as it came from the
range. The same fowl, after being fed
three weeks, would weigh five and a
quarter pounds and sell for twelve
cents a pound at the lowest calcula
tion, which would be 63 cents for the
same carcass, after having been fed
for three weeks. The estimate placed
upon the cost of feeding is about ten
to twelve cents per head.
What is known as the yellow
skinned or yellow-meated poultry is
prime favorite in the markets of this
country. To intensify and beautify
the richness of these colors, meal made
from yellow corn is largely used in
the process of fattening. For the
English market, which Is largely
catered to by these packers, fowls
having the white color of flesh are pre
ferred. To intensify and improve this,
ground oats, meal from white corn,
and some finely ground rice is made
use of. To add luster, finish and
quality to all these, a small per cent
of melted tallow is mixed into the
warm mash, and fed in a semi-liquid
state the last four or five days of feed
ing.
The fattening of poultry with corn
adds fatty globules throughout the
entire carcass. A fowl that has been
fattened with corn Is usually what
might be termed greasy meat, white
poultry finished or fattened In this,
way lays on close or solid meat with
no globules of fat scattered through it
Crate and machine fattened poultry
sells for the highest prices of any
poultry sent to market.
A peculiarity in these conditions is
the fact that poor or inferior speci
mens cannot be successfully fattened
or finished in this way. Only the well
grown thrifty specimens can be profit
ably crate-fattened and improved in
weight and character of flesh. One
must understand thoroughly well the
process of handling poultry for this
purpose, or he cannot succeed. Where
it is well done and nicely finished and
prepared for market, poultry finished
in this manner is the most desirable,
both in this country and abroad.
PACKING FOR MARKET.
In packing for market, square boxes
that will hold 12, 24 and 48 chickens
are made use of. Fowls all of one
size and weight with the same ap
pearance are packed in one box. This
plan is of great advantage in selling.
Farmers and country people generally
lose a large amount of profit through
the carelessness in dressing and send
ins their fowls to market. When nice
ly graded and selected, all of one kind
in a package, both eggs and poultry
bring the highest prices. It is the
finest quality that makes the profit in
poultry growing. This is what the
large packing houses, which handle
Kindreds of thousands of fowls in this
way, aim to make of all they fatten. —
Cultivation of Garden Crops.
Frequent shallow cultivation should
be employed for most garden crops,
and during dry weather the depth
should not exceed 2 inches. By keep
ing the surface soil well stirred what
is termed a "dust mulch" is formed,
and while this layer of finely pulver
ized soil will become quite dry, it pre
vents the escape of moisture through
the pores of the soil. A mulch con
sisting of fine manure, clippings from
the lawn, or any similar material,
spread to a distance of 10 or 12 inches
around the plants will preserve the
moisture; but the mulch should not be
so heavy or matted as to exclude the
air.
A crust forming over the soil after
a rain or watering is detrimental to
plant growth and should be broken up
as soon as the land can be worked.
To determine when the soil is suf
ficiently dry for cultivation, apply the
same test of squeezing together in the
hand as is utilized in determining when
to plow. Sandy soils can be worked
much sooner than clay soils after a
rain. Too much importance cannot
be placed upon the matter of thorough
cultivation of the garden, and if the
work is promptly and properly done
there will be little difficulty in con
trolling weeds.
