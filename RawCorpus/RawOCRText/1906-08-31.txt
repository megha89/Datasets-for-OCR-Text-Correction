DIED SUDDENLY
OF HEART DISEASE.
How frequently does a head line simi-
lar to the above greet us in the news-
papers. The rush, push and stronuous-
uess of the American people has a strong
tendency to lead up to valvular and other
affections of the heart, attended by ir-
regular action, palpitation, dizziness,
smothered sensations and athtr distress-
Ins symptoms.
Three of the prominent ingredients of
which Dr. Plerce'g Golden Medical Dis-
covery is made are reeoiranonded by sorao
of the leading writers on Matecla Malica
tor the cure of just such cases, (iolden
Seal root, for instance, is said by the
United States DiBPKHBATOBr, a stand-
ard authority, "to impart tone and in-
creased power to tfffi heart's action."
Numerous other leading authorities rep--
resent Golden Seal aa an unsurpassed
tonic for tho muscular system in general,
and as the heart is almost wholly com-
posed of muscular tissue, it naturally
follows that it must bo greatly strength-
ened by this superb, general tonic. ISut
probably the most Important ingredient
of " Golden Medical Discovery." so far
as its marvelous cures of valvular aiul
other affections of the heart arc con-
cerned, is Stone root, or Colllnsonia Cun..
Prof. Wm. Paine, author of Paine's
Epitomy of Medicine. Bays of it:
"I, not lone since, had a'paiient who was
so much oppressed wllh valvular disease of
tho heart that hU friends were obllrvd to
tarry him up-stalrs. He, however, ertulunlly
locovered under the Influence of Colllnsouin
Iniedicinal principle extracted from
root), and is now attending to his business.
Heretofore physicians knew of no remedy
for tlie removal of so distressing and so dan-
trerous a malady. With them it was all
Buoss-work, and it fearfully warned the
afflicted that death was near at hand. Col-
Unsonln unquestionably affords relief in
such cases, and in most iustances effects a
cure."
Stone root is also recommended by Drs.
Hale and Ellingwood, of Chicago, for
valvular and other diseases of tho heart.
Tho latter says: "It is a heart tonic of
direct and permanent Influence."
"Golden Medical Discovery," not only
cures serious heart affections, but is a
most efficient poncral tonic and tnvlgor-
ator. strengthening tho stomach, invig-
orating the liver, regulating tho bowels
and curing catarrhui affections in al!
parts of the system.

The Story of an Invention.
The power loom was the invention of
a farmer's boy, who had never seen or
heard of such a thing. He fashioned
one with his penknife, and when he </ot
It all done he showed it with great en
thusiasm to his father, who at once
kicked it all to pieces. Baying he wou.'d
have no "?oy about him who would
spend his time ou such foolish things.
The boy was sent to a blacksmith to
learn a trade, and his master took a
lively interest in him. lie mad ft a
loom of what was left of the one his
father had broken up and showed It to
his master. The blacksmith saw Le
had no common boy as au apprentice,
and that the invention was a valuable
one. He had a loom constructed under
the supervision of the boy. It worked
to their perfect satisfaction, and the
blacksmith furnished the means to
manufacture the looms, and the boy
received half the profits. In about a
year the blacksmith wrote to the boy's
father that he should bring with him
a wealthy gentleman, who was the in
ventor of the celebrated power loom.
You may be able to judge of the as
tonishment at the old home when his
son was presented to him as the in
ventor, who told him that the loom
was the same as the model that he
had kicked to pieces the previous year.
The Fainter.
There is as much fallacy In attempt-
Ing to prove tne origin of pointing as ill
a like attempt to prove the origin of
eatiuir. As a matter of fact, the point
ing act commonly exhibited by tlio
pointer and setter is an incident of the
capture or attempted capture of food
by dogs, and also by wolves and foxes.
Coyotes have been seen to draw and
point on prairie dogs and grouse in
precisely the same manner that the
pointer aud setter draw ou game birds.
There were the same rigidity aud
stealth, the pause to judge of distance
and opportunity and the final rigid
pause when all the energies are con
centrated for the final spring to cap
ture. All tlie phenomena displayed by
the dog family indicate that the draw
ing and pointing in the pursuit of prey
were ever natural traits. It may be
reasonably believed that man could
not breed the pointing instinct out of
the dog if he attempted to do so. —

A Gentle WiHli.
It was their honeymoon. They had
moved into a pretty suburban house
and were getting settled cozily at last.
"I have (something for you," she said
when he came home from the office.
"A present?''
"Yes. You have no night key, so I
had one made for you. Here it is."
"That was very thoughtful of you.
But how did you come to take so much
trouble?"
"I wanted it as a kind of barometer.
You'll let me look at it now aud then,
won't yon?"'
"Certainly."
'•I'm not going to say you mustn't go
out evenings, and I'm not going to sit
up uutil you come home when you are
out late. I only hope," she said coax
ingly, "that every time I look at it tlie
key will be a little bit rustier, and theu
I will know that home pleases you
more than any other place."
The Fountain Pen.
The fountain ren is not an invention
of recent years. In Samuel Taylor's
'•Universal System of Shorthand 'Writ
ing," published in 17SG, we find proof
of the fountain pen's great age.
"I have nothing more to add," wrote
Samuel Taylor, "for the use or instruc
tion of the practitioner, except a few
words concerning the kind of pen prop
er to be used for writing shorthand.
For expeditious writing, some use what
are called fountain pens, into which
your i-ik is put, which gradually flows
when writing, from thence into a small
er pen cut short to fit the smailai- end
of this instrument, but it is a hard
matter to meet with a good one of this
kind."
The Fork.
It is about 1,900 years ago since tha
fork made its appearance in Europe.
In 09 A. D. a sou of the doge Fietro
Orsolo had wedded in Venice the Briz
zautiue Princess Argila, who produced
at the wedding breakfast a silver fork
and gold spoon. Then the high Vene
tlon families followed suit, and theso
martyrs to fashion pricked their lips
with the new instrument. The fork
prospered, however, and spread over
Italy. In 1379 it had traveled as far
as France, and in 1608 a traveler
brought It direct to England.
Both Hate Him.
"Funny thing," remarked Wilson
musingly. "Tom Wilkins and Edith
Brown used to be great friends of

They got married, and now neither of
them will speak to me. Wonder what
the reason can be?"

A certain lady who wished to have
some fun at the expense of an agent
who had ofttlmes solicited her to in
sure herself and family, asked him ou
one occasion if he would Insure the cat.
The agent, to the astonishment and no
small amusement of some frionds,
promptly offered to do so, provided she
paid the first premium down. The
lady, still thinkiug to hoax him, ex
pressed her willingness to do so, aud
placed a shilling on the table. The
agent quickly produced a proposal,
filled it in and obtained her signature
while those present were ou the tiptoe
of expectascy as to what was to fol
low.
"Now, madam, with your permission,
may I see the cat?"
"Certainly," she replied, at the sarno
time pointing to a glass case which
contained the stuffed remains of tha
poor defunct eat.
A chorus of derisive laughter burst
from all present, but to their dismay
the agent turned, bowed politely, at the
came t;uie picking up the shilling, and
exclaimed:
''When that cat dies, madam, kindly
call at our office and claim the insur
ance money. Good morning."— London

The most important uses of fire were
taiight by fire itself. As the primitive
man stood near tho flames of the burn
ing tree aud felt their pleasant glow he
learned that fire may add to bodily
comfort, and when the tlames swept
through a forest aud overtook a deer
and baked it he learned that fire might
be used to improve the quality of hia
food. The hint was not lost. He took
a burning torch to his cave or hut and
kindled him a fire on his floor of earth.
His dwelling filled with smoke, but be
could endure the discomfort for tho
sake of the fire's warmth and for tho
sake of the toothsomeness of the cook
ed meats. After a time a hole was
made in the roof of the hut, and
through this hole the smoke passed out.
Here was the first stove. The primi
tive stove was the entire house, the
floor was the fireplace and the hole in
the roof was the chimney. The word
"stove" originally meant "a heated
room." So that if we should say that
at first people lived iv their stoves wo
would say that which is literally true.

or not life is present: The point select
ed is the forearm, which is quickly ac
cessible, is free from hair and is easily
exposed. The arm is extended horizon
tally from the body and the forearm
pronated. If the test is made in Ihe
open air a cloak is held so as to shield
the part from all motion of the atmos
phere. The flame of a candle is now
directly applied to a spot on the fore
arm, which is closely watched by tho
observer. At the end of a few secoudn
a swelling rapidly forms and bursts.
If it contains air or gas tlie tissues are
lifeless. If it contains liquid or exuda
tion life is present.
'•Man In «he Street."
E Emerson was not the first to use this
p phrase in his "Conduct of Life," which
•was published in 1880; In the first se
rries of the ''Oreville Memoirs," under
d date March 22, IS3O, occurs the follow
iing passage: ' \\ r/±r /±-
"Then will come the question of a
dissolution, which one side affirms will
take place directly, and the other that
the king will not consent to it, know
ing, as 'the man in Uie street' (as wo
call him at Newmarket) always does,
(he greatest secrets of kings and being
the confidant of their most hidden
thoughts."
It would appear from this that tho
expression was in common use among
racing men in IS3o.— Notes and Que

The thermophile fabrics of C. Herr
gott, of Valdoie, France, introduced
a novel method ot applying warmth,
and are expected to do much for
domestic electric beating. The
fabrics are a combination ot textile
aud conductive threads, the latter
being made of any required size aud
combining with any textile materials.
When woven, the electrotheimio wires
are hidden, many electrothermic
wetts enter into each circuit, aud the
circuits are joined by collector wires,
of which one pole is placed in each
selvage of the fabric. There ia no
danger of fire or other accident. The
temperature may range from 70 de
grees to 95 degrees I*. for carpets up
to 250 degrees to 300 degrees for hot
air baths, and the possible applica
tions are many, including use for
toot-warmers and articles of clothing
and furniture, drying appaiatus, b«by
incubators aud numerous hospital
appliances and most purposes requir

Fourcault, of 13elgium, combines

surface. In the new method, the
molten material ia drawn upward
through a system ot rullers rising in
a tier of seventeen pairs. The thick
ness is regulated by the distance
apait of the rollers iv the pairs, aud
the glass produced is perfectly flat

A naturalist relates that the appear

Sulphur is being tried in Germany
as a wood preservative. It is applied
in molten form, and as it hardens it
completely tills the pores. At moder
ate temperatures it is unaffected by
water, weak or strong acids, or
alkaline solutions. A disadvantage is
that the sulphur melts at 115 degrees
!«'., aud this makes the treated wood
uurit for places exposed to consider
able he:it. Tho best wood • for use

of oak aud pine having been much

Biggest Bridge on Earth.
A dispatch from Quebec says work
is now progressing very radidly ou
what is, without exception, tbe largest
bridge in the world. When it is com
pleted some time uext year, long be
fore the Grand Trunk Pacific Railroad
will be ready to use it, tbe steel work

alone weigh more than '200,000 pounds
and are now being placed in position
by the largest electric crane ever
built for any purpose.
This great mass of machinery
stands 300 feet high and moves along
as it builds its own ground. The
construction of the bridge is one of
the engineering feat 3ot the age, and
bridge builders have come from all
parts of the world to watch tbe prog
ress of the work.
When completed tbe bridge will
have two centre posts, each of which
will weigh 3,000,000 pounds. These
posts are 315 feet high from tbeir

is placed in position will be 410 teet

New Naturalization
Law Soon in Effect.
Tbe new United States naturaliza
tion law, passeud Jane 29, 1906, which
goes into effect within ninety days
from that date, makes many changes
in proceedings by which persons are
naturalized, among which are the fol
lowing:
Ninety days must elapse between
tiling petition and granting of papers.
Notice of application for naturaliza
tion has to be given to tbe depart
ment of commerce and labor. Final
papers mast be taken out within
seven years after first papers are
granted, or first paper taken out over
again. No peison can be naturalized
unless he can speak English language.
AH persons landing in this country
will have a certificate issued them by
the Bureau of Immigration, stating
their description, date of landing,
vessel, etc, which certificate must
be presented by them when they
apply for naturalization.
Two witnesses are required instead
of one, as at present. Certificates of
naturalization are printed at Wash
ington on specially prepared paper,
and numbered and distributed from
there with blanks for application,
etc., and all naturalizations are to
be reported to Washington. All
United district and circuit courts of
record having clerks and seals, and
having general jurisdiction unlimited
as to tbe amounts in controversy
which incudes all tbe State District
Courts, have jurisdiction to near
and grant applications for naturaliza
tion. The cost of obtaining papers
under tbe new law will be less in this
state than formerly.

Official Paper of Amador co.
FRIDAY AUGUST 31, 1906
Tariff Revision.
The tariff issue is now, as it has
always been, the main line of demar
cation betweeu the republican and
democratic paities. The republican
party stands lor a protective tariff,
the democratic party for a tariff for
revenue only. The Uingley tariff bill,
which is the law to-d«y, has proved
the most, potent measure in develop
ing the domestic and foreign com
merce of the United States ever passed j
by congress. Tho progress of the
country in the past decade has been
marvelous. History cannot furuisu
uuytbiug like a parallel to it. Every
part ot the Union, every department
of industry, has enjoyed uninter
rupted prosperity. Because of this,
fact, the cry raised, "Let well
euough alone;" "don't niiinkey with
the tariff;" "cjtaud pat," and other
expressions, all intended to discoun
tenance any interference whatever
with the existing taritt schedule. Any
readjustment, they argue, will disturb
industrial conditions that will ieuct
disastrously all along the line. In
spite of these standpatters' wailiugs,
a strong element ot the republican
party is clamoring for a revision of
the tariff, to meet the changed con
ditions of the country tj-day. This
wing is as devoted to the doctrine of
protection as the most ardent protec
tionist, but they contend that the
time has come when au intelligent re
adjustment of the tariff is a duty in
cumbent upon the republican paity.
As a fosterer of struggling home in
dustries, the present taritt has been a
complete success. The protective tariff
is merely a policy, designed to accom
plisb a certain object. There is noth
ing sacred about it. As the object
in many cases has been attained, the
custom rates should be modified to
meet the existing conditions. Presi
dent Roosevelt has strongly announ
ced himself in favor of this rear
rangement. There- is no tariff sched
ule, no matter how nicely adapted to
the wants of the country when
passed, that can be claimed as a fixity,
especially along protective lines. It
is made, in fact, to lie changed when
ever circumstances demand. There is
no reason to tear a general distuib
anoa of commercial interests by a
prudent adjustment. Evils wiU be
corrected thereby, and the country
will be benefited rather than other
wise. It i 3 for the friends of the
Dingley tariff bill— the party of pro
tection to undertake this work. If il
were done by the free trade paity —
the democrats— there would unques
tionably ba a serious disarrangement
of business affairs. O.ving to the
growing demand even in the republi
can rank? for readjustment, the dem
ocrats are hugging tho hope that they
will control the next congress. We
balieve they will be disappointed, and
that tariff revision will ba brought
about by the. republican protection
ists.
So far thera is no candidate on the
reiiublicau side for the office of as
eeiublymau. Vosco Matson of Augels
is out for the nomination on the
democratic side. Here is an office
going bagging for a republican caudi
date iv a strong republican district.
What's the matter, The republican
nominating convention is only one
week distant, aud no one for legisla
tive honors in the assembly. Its about
time to get a move on. As a matter
of tact, the office of assemblyman is
about the most important to the tax
payers of Amador county, as matters
now staud, in the whole raft of po
litcial berths. An assemblyman true
to the interests of this county could
easily save to the taxpayers, by the
introduction of judicious measures
adapted to the needs of the people,
from twenty to thirty cents in the tax
rate, and that too without huiHng the
publio service one jot. TheasseniMy
mau has a better opportunity to make
a distinguished record than any other
office within the gift of the people.
And the major part of his work in
this direction would be in the correc
tion of the blunders made by his pre
decessors which are now enacted into
laws. The truth is, the assemblyman,
under the present apportionment, is
about as lar removed from the people
of Amador county as a senator of the
United states.

Get Registered.
Registration is proceeding very
slowly. Unless the voters get a good
move on soon, the vote oast at the
coming election promises to be the
lightest in the history of the county
for 'JO years. Registration closes
September 2t!. There is therefore lest^
than one mouth for, citizens to get id
the voting Hue. The democrats will
hold their convention to day and get
their local ticket in the field. The
nominees will thereafter exert them
selves to the utmost to get the party
adherents to register, and there wilJ
remain over three weeks to do
effective work in this direction betore
the regular campaign work com
meuces. On the other hand, the re
publicans, holding their convention
on the 2"Jd September, will give theii
candidates no opportunity to accom
plish anything in tbis way after
nomination. Republicans must re
member tbis. There is absolutely no
movement on their side to get their
torce3 registered. Everything seeing
to be left to the go-as-you-please
method in this all important matter.
We urge upon republicans to get re
gistered. Also make inquiries to the
end that you relatives and friends be
placed on the register. We have
voters enough to sweep the ticket to
victory, but they will be of no use
unless registered. Prospective candi
dates on the republican ticket will do
well to watch this registration busi
ness, and see to it that their party
friends are not lagging behind ia^hia
preliminary skirmish. Mobilize you 1
army preparatory to utilizing its
strength at the decisive moment.
A Stuffed Convention.
Jt is a singular fact Unit while tbe
republicans have had a clear party
majority in Atnador county, not only
in the piesidential election of two
years ago, but also at the state elec
tion four years, still tbe democratic
convention which meets tomorrow
will have more members than the
republican oonvention which meets
three weeks hence. And yet the
apportionment is mace on the same
basis, In each case, namely, one dele
gate for every 15 votes. The demo
cratic convention will consist of 87
delegates, and the republican body of
H4. How is this? The explanation is
that the republican apportionment is
based on the vote cast at the last
geneial election of two years ago,
while the democratic apportionment
i 3 based on the vote for Lane for
governor in 1902, when the total vote
of Amador county was much larger
tban it was two years ago. In 1902
the total vote was 2806 whereas in
1901 the vote was 2107— a falliug off
of 399 votes. Ihe vote at the last
geueral election is the true method
of apportionment, hut the figures of
that political contest, if taken as
the basis for the democratic member
ship in th"c coming convention,
would have exposed the weakness of
their side to a degree never before
approached. They were beaten by
361 majority. So that it that elec
tion had been adopted by them, their
convention would have consisted of
00 members, against 81 for the re
publicans. So they trotted back a
couple of years and took the vote for
Lane as a standard, who was defeated
hy 86, in a much larger total of. votes.
In this dishonest way they get four
more delegates in convention than
tbe republicans, and carry the im
pression to the unthinking that they
are in the ascendant, instead of trail
ing in tbe rear with 364 against them.
The Assessment Roll.
There h,aa been some couimeßt oon
ceruiuß the reduced assessment roll
of the county as compared with last
year. The total, outside of the rail
road assessment for the last two years
is as follows:
1905 - - - 85,324,568
1906 - - 5,116,070
Decrease - . 207,4498
The question is asked, why is there
such a material reduction in value?
In what section of the couaty has
property fallen to account tor this
loss. Will not this declioe, cause a
jump in the tax rate for this year?
In explanation, we may say, that, the
reduction is merely one of figures,
and not in actual value. Last year a
mortgage, of the sum of 8200,000 on
mining property in Fioueer distict,
was listed at its face value, it was
really • a flctitiou mortage. The tax
on the mortgage was not paid. The
mortgage has siuce been cancelled,
so that it does not figure in the
assessment roll of this year. This
iv itselt accounts for the diHereuce.
With this explanation the actual de
eliue ot assessment value amounts to
87,498.
It is stated that George Kirkwood
has finally deoided to retuse to allow
his name to go before the democratic
convention tor county clerk. Tho
probability is that John K. Huberty,
present deputy clerk, will be placed
on the ticket tor that office.
THE AMA>:>K LEBGEP; JACKSON, CALiroliS lA, FRIDAY, AUGUST 31, 1906.
Political Notes.
JMatt Joy ia tbiukiug of coming out
for the Humiliation for constable of
townsbip oue, ou the republican
ticket.
A. B. CnmiiH'tti is making a can
vass for tbe nominatiou of county
recorder on the democratic side, lie
bas been gettiug in effective work
too, the past week or two. The
uame of W. E. Kent is mentioned as
a candidate for coroner aud pabJifl
administrator on the republican side.
Ueo. M. Huberty, present democratic
incumbent, may have to Rive up the
idea of reuou:iuation in case his
brother is put on the ticket for the
clerkship.
D. S. Gray, T. S. Tuttlo and Tom
i'rudgou are aspirants for constable
on the republican ticket in Township
The offices of constable and justice
appear to be more sought after than
couuty offices. Ihe salary law for
township officers has fixed the thirig
good and plenty. A constable at S5O
01 ?55 per month, and tees for civil
cases is really better ott' and better
paid than a county officer, and he
can suit himself whether he does
much or little for bis moDey. He cnii
be depended upon to choose the
latter, lv Sutter Greek there are
three republican after the plum, and
two democrats. In every other town
ship there is likely to be a spirited
tight for the nomination.
The apportionment of delegates in
the call for the republicpu county
convention is incorrect in several
particulars. The corrections should
be made as follows: East Jackson
with 94 votes is given 5 delegates;
it is entitled to 6. South Jackson
with 71 votes, is entitled to 5 dele
gates, and is given 6. South A mad or
with 23 votes, is entitled to 2 dele
gates, and is credited with only 1
Lancba Piana with 30 votes, js en
titled to 2 delegates instead of 1.
The republicans in the various pre
cincts will elect the number of dele
gates to which they are entitled, on
the basis of one for every 15 votes or
majority fraction thereof. Any cler
ical error in the call cannot operate
to deprive them of their proper re
presentation, neither can it give them
more delegates than they are entitled
t*>.
The card of T. K. Norman, our
present sheriff, and tax collector,
appears iv this issue, formally au
uounciug his candidacy for re-nomina
tion before the republican conven
tion, it has been well known that
be was a candidate to succeed him
seit. The nomination rests with the
delegates to the county convention,
and any time before the election of
the delegates or the assembly of the
convention is time enough to make a
declaration of candidacy. No argu
ment based on the fact that be has
not announced himself before, should
have the slightest influence with the
convention. He is a candidate, and
that is sufficient. He has made an
exellent lecord as sheriff, and while
he was, on account of business con
siderations undecided for a time
about seeking re-nomination, he has
so arranged his affairs, that he de
sires the endorsement of a re-nomina
tion. He is strong before the voters,
aud we feel satisfied that he can be
re-elected easily.
Get in Line with Popular Sentiment
On the eve of tbe republican state
convention, the knowing ones are
still at sea as to who is likely to
bead tbe ticket. But there is no dis
puting that public sentiment de
mands tbe renomination of George C.
Pardee. If the machine thrusts him
aside, aDd thereby flies in the face of
public opinion, tbeir action is likely
to be resented on election day by a
large number of republican voters.
As a rule republicans accept the
ohoice of a state convention without
question. Usually, the rank and Hie
ot the party have no decided pre
ference as tar as the head of the
ticket is concerned. They bow to
the choice of the party in convention
assembled. Hut this year it is
diltereut. When the convention is
made up largely of appointed dele
gates—delegates appointed for the
express purpose of misrepresenting
and thwarting the nishes of the
people-. the party voters are not dis
posed to tamely submit to such high
banded proceedings, when the
nominee does not conform to the
popular sentiment. In this crisis,
the convention will do well to con
sider the situation carefully. Judg
ing from Ainador county,— and we
presume the feeilng here is a fair
index of the party sentiment through
out the state— the turning down of
Pardee, and the forcing of a machine
candidate in his place, will mean a
serious falling off in the vote for the
standard bearer. We have heard the
remark: "If so and so is put up for
governor, I do not know that 1 will
vote for him. I do not consider he
will have any claim upon me as a
party man."

MIDDLE BAK
Things aro rather slow here tbis
week, just a few little things happen
ed to let us know, 1 suppose, that we
are still on the map.
Mr and Mrs bird, of Eleelra, have
been visiting Mrs Bird's parents, (tie
Uoitano's, for the paEt week. Ou
Saturday uight last a party was held
iv then- honor, which was atteuced
by every one in the neighborhood.
Music aud daucing took up the time
until miduißht, when a very dainty
aud palatable collation was served.
1-Jveryone enjoyed the evening to
the utmost.
Mrs Parady baa been in Mokelumne
Hill for several days, under a doctor's
care. She pricked the ball uf her
thumb slightly, so slightly that she
does uot know when or how. From
this insignificant beginning develop
ed a severs case of blood poisoning,
and for some days it was doubtful if
the thumb could be saved. Prompt
attention and care saved the membor,
however, and we are all very glad
that our neighbor is now ou the fair
way to recovery.
Ewil Chuma and Frank Uaima, are
about to rusticate in the Ligh Sierra
tor a couple ot weeks. They start
next AJouday for Kirkwoods, Blue
Lakes, Lake Tahoo aud way stations.
b'rank Howeth and J. H. Adams,
our two genial prospectors, entertain
ed Mr Kiug, an old time friend of Mt
Howeth's, on Sunday Jast. Mr King
has dug out enough money to make
ten men rich, and is iv no wise cast
down because others reaped the re
ward of his industry aud shrewdness.
He still expects to strike it rich,
aud tind a vein so good [.that any
miue now in existence will be poor
beside it. More power to him.
Ben Fregulia was called to Jackson
on Saturday, to see bis brothre John,
tbe big blacksmith, who had taken a
sudden turn for the worse. The
crisis passed, however, and Joiin
remains with us for many moons we
hope.
It is rumored that a rich strike has
been made in the FatreJi wine,
whether it is true 1 do not know, but
hope sincerely that it muy be, for
Messrs Thomas and Leouesio, the
lessees, surely deserve succpss, for
they have labored hard and faith
fully.
All along the old metal lode things
are doing cnce more. At the Amador
Queeu, I< rank Fuller, Alike Driscoll
and several others are digging away.
At the Valpariso, Uomiuic Kow and
partners, are working with good ore
in sight, ana on the Marlette, Messrs
Howeth and Adams are prospecting
with good indications. Now, if
brother Caminetti would oniy come
down and dig a few thousands out of
the St. Julien every one would be
quite happy.
If one can oDly stay with it, the
old lode pays every time. 1 can not
recall a single instance where the
returns did not come when the
workers persevered.
Democratic Convention.
The democratic county convention
for the nomination of a fuil county
ticket, and to elect delegates to the
state convention, will be held in
Jackson tomorrow, September 1. The
convention will consist of 87 dele
gates. Of coarse the slate is about
all made up by the would-be dic
tators of the party. The clerkship
has been somewnat unsettled, as
George Kivkwood is, or was up to a
day or two ago, undecided whether to
take the nomioation. For assessoi
also the unterriUed are lacking a
candidate. It is safe to say there
will be no blanks on the deaiocratic
side.
Labor Day Celebration.
The celobratiou ot labor day will
take place in Jackson on Monday
next, uuder tne auspices of Jackson
Miners' Union No. 115, W. P. M.
Preparations are being made on an
elaborate scale for this event, which
promises to bo one of the most not
able ever witnessed in the ccunty. A
platform has been erected on Main
streeet, in front of thn Union House,
80 feet long, for the tug ot war. It
is reported that a team from Sutler
Creek and Amador will contest with
a Jackson team. Drilling contests
and races are programmed, all with
fat prizes to the winners. It is re
ported that ail rigs and saddle horses
in the different towns have been
engaged tor that day, so that a big
attendance may be looked for.
The forests of the upper Mississippi
Valley of the Uieat Lakes region and
of the Southern States have furnished
lumber for generations to the treeless
prairies of the West and the denuded
lands of the Kast. But the saw is
cutting deep into the last of the tall
timber of the North and more and
more sunlight is being let in upon
the Southland. .Prices for northern
white pine and southern yellow pine
have risen in the last few years by
leaps and bounds. The lumber dealer
of the East has turned his eyes to a
new source of supply. As a result,
Portland, Oregon, in the center of
the great American forest, has become
the greatest lumberjcity in the union,
far outstripping Minneapolis; and
Portland is but at the threshold of its
great iudustry. Oregon is the great
est lumber state iv the union. Dur
ing the next geneiatiou, and so far as
one may judge, for all time, Port
land is to hold its supremacy as the
greatest sawmill city. The national
hung r for lumber grows year by
year, and Portland commands the
gate to the forest. — Donald Mac

out for hor in every way needed.
Wednesday evening, the aged woman
fell to the floor in the kitchen. She
was alone at tbe time, and finding
that she was seriously hurt, and
could cot rise, called for help. Her
screams quickly brought Airs Rule
to her aid, and a doctor was suinrnon
ed, who found that the bone near the
hip was fractuied. For one of her
advanced age, the injury is serious.
She did not fall from any height, but
morely in walkijjg across the floor.
'As age increases the bouea become
brittle, and are easily broken. Mrs
Bennetts is a grandmother of Mrs
Tnoruaj Leruiu of Jackson, who went

The New Bank Proposition.
It is now definitely understood that
the purchase of the Harper saloon
property on Main street was made in
view of the establishment of another
banking institution iv tbis city. The
incorporation articles will be filed in
the clerk's office this week. Whether
Ihe movement will eventuate in two
banks here ie not certain at present.
The projectors are men of wealth and
influence from all over the county.
They realize that there is baldly
business enough to justify two banks,
and an effort will be made to con
solidate or buy the property of the
old bank. Should this fail, however,
it is certain that another bank will
be started in a short time, in the
Harper saloon premises. The front
of tbe building will be taken out and
a new, modern and handsome front
will take its place, with vaults, safety
boxes, and other interior fittings to
suit.

and medical aid was called. He is
forty jears ot age, aud bad beeu
wotking around tbe mines here for
tbe past four months. Whether be

If be does, tbe cbauccs are that he
will be paralyzed downward from the
point where the backhone is injured.
It appears on reaching tbe station

customary light, bis candle having
gone out. Iv tbe darkness be walked
into the chute. His back is broken

prohibited size, are mainly left.

FATAL ACCIDENT.
Ernest Giannini Killed by Runaway
Team.
A fatal accident occurred near Jack
son on Wednesday, about one o'clock,
the victim being Ernest Giannini, a
young man 21 years of age. He was
the only son of Mr and Mrs Gaetauo
Giannini, and lived with bis parents
on tbe Belluomini ranch, a couple of
miles south of this city. He was
employed about the ranch. On the
fatal day he ba^l been hauling wood
with a four-borse team. 'The wagon
became out of repair — the break block
was out of positiou, aud the back
axle also ueeded fixing. After dinner
be bitched up tbe team to tbe empty
wagon, intending to bring it to Jack
son to l.c repaired. His cousin Frank
Giannini, a boy, started with him aud
also another farm hand whose name
we have not learned. Everything
went well until they reached the
grade of the French Bar road descend
ing to South Jackson. At tbe top of
the bill tbn team got unmanageable
and started to run. Tho road i 3 a
very rough one, and the down grade
added to the danger. Frank and the
other companion were either jolted
otf or jumped ott to escape the
danger. Ernest, who was driving,
kept bis seat as well as he could
holding the lines, and trying to guide
them in their flight. The other two
escaped without injury except a few
bruises, and tbe team went on almost
hidden from them in a cloud of dust.
They did uot see tbe accident which
happened some hundred yards from
the point ware they were thrown out.
It is supposed that a violent jolt or a
stumble of tbe horses, threw Giannini
from his seat, iv front of the wagon,
and in the midst of the team.
Whether the wagon went over him,
cr whether he struck against a rock
in the road is not known. By a
singular coincidence, his mother was
on her way home from Jacksou, aud
witnessed the runaway, and was one
of the first to reach ber son as he lay
helpless and fatally hurt in the road
way. Assistance was called and P.
L. Cassiuelli and others carried the
wounded man to the Chicago hotel
on Broadway. He was oonscious, but
could uot explain bow he was hurt.
It was evident to all that his injuries
were grave. A mark across the chest
indicated the seat of iujury. He
complained of pain about the chest,
and once or twice on the way to tho
hotel they had to change the positiou
in which they were carrying him, so
as to alleviate his suffering. Di.
Endicott was summoned, but could
do little for him. The vital organs
were involved, probably the Inngs
crushed. He lived two hours after
tbe accident.
No inquest was held by the coronet
Ihe funeral will take place tomorrow.
After young Giannini was thrown out
tbe runaway team kept on at full
speed, down the grade. The wagon
was thereafter soon overturned. The
horses became detached and were
stopped at South Jackson. They
were unhurt. The wagou, however,
was wrecked badly.

a mosquito sting? Why do we feel
unhappy in the Good Old Summer
Time? Answer: we don't. We use
DeWitt's Witch Hazel Savle, and

The Staples' Case.
It is now n couple ot weeks since
the remitittur was received from the
supreme court in this noted case,
ana still nothing has been done to
ward.- bringing tbe matter before the
trial court. The district attorney
was abseut when the remitittur was re
oelved and did not return until last-
Thursday, ibis week A. Caminetti
departed for the city. He is tbe
leading counsel before the supeiior
court. W. G. Snyder was over this
week, making inquiries and says that
some action will be taken early next
week, if not before. He is assistant
counsel for defendant. W. J. McGee
attended to the case on appeal. With
the decision of the supreme court,
bis duties ended. Staples has been in
tbe county jail eighteen months. If
no further trial is to be bad, owing
to insufficiency of eviJence.it is due
to him to turn him loose at the ear
liest moment. His retention in jail
is only needless expense upon the
countly, as well as an injustice to
the defendant.
Leg Broken.
Charles Forbes, employed at the
clay pit of tbe 1. a E. Kailroad, a
short distance from lone, met with a
serious accident last Wednesday. He
was running out a car, and the car
got off the track. He bad working
gloves ou at tbe time, and oue glove
got caught in the car as it overturned,
dragging Forbes with it. He sustain
ed a fracture of tne leg in two places,
one above aud the other below the
ankle. His injuries will lay in in up
for a couple of months.

MINING NOTES.
Kennedy— The mill has been run
ning 60 stamps. They were about 30
men short of a full force for tbe 100
stamp mill, but it is not believed the
reduction of the milling power is
owing to lack of men. Another large
compressor is being installed, suffi
cient to run about 15 drills. Tbis
with the ore now in use will give
ample power to run all the drills
needed. Tbe foundation for tbe new
compressor is being laid, the com
pressor itself has been on band some
time.
Argonaut— At this mine sinking
operations were commnced this week.
The shaft will be put down 200 or 300
feet deep. Tbe present depth is 2100
feet. Three shifts are at work foui
men on a shift working eight hours
each. The sinking will take several
months to complete.
At tbe Kennedy mine it is expected
that underground work will be sus
pended Sunday aud Monday, so as to
enable the safety clutches to be ad
justed to the skips at tbe east shaft.
It is thought the work can be done in
two days, and these days are selected
because thereby less interruption to
the active mining will be entailed.
A Close Call.
Tho Ledger office was the scene of
un accident Tuesday morning, which
fortunately passed off with nothing
more serious than a few flesh bruise",
although the victim came very close
to losing his life. Lewis Love, a boy
of Id, had been working the job press,
running with electricity from a two
borse power motor. Tbe main shaft,
ten or eleven feet from the floor was
revolving at a speed of 150 revolu
tions per minute. Young Love,
moved by curiosity got up on a step
ladder close to the shaft to find out
the speed thereof, l»aviug the motor
still running. A set screw caught
his clothing, aud in a second be was
revolving around with the shaft.
Furtunately, there was sufficient
space between the shaft aud the brick
wall to enable his body to revolve
without striking, otherwise he would
have been killed. Before tho power
could bo turned otf he had made from
15 to 20 revolutions. He retained his
presence of mind, and hugged tbe
shaft as closely as he could. A loose
plank struck nim in the cheek mak
ing quite a gash, and ho was cut
iibout the arm and side; but, as luck
would have it no bones were broken.
It was several minutes before he
could be released by cutting most of
his clothing fiom his body. He was
able to walk home after, the mishap,
but has been unable to woik since,
being very sore from tbe injuries.
Me expected to go today to take a six
months course in the Stockton busi
ness college, but whether be will be
able to do so is uncertain.
FIRE IN VOLCAMO,
Volcano narrowly escaped destruc
tion from fire early Monday morning.
About 3 o'clock the property ou
Main street foimely occupied by La
vezzo, adjoining L. H. Cook's on oue
side aud C&ssinelh's store on the
other, was found to be on fire. The
fire started from a lighted candle
being left to burn out, and started a
blaze in inflamable material around
it. The spread of tbe flames was
fortunately arrested by the prompt
supply of water under good pressure
As it was it burned mucb of the in
side of tbe building, and destroyed
tbe roof.
It seems that the brick front part
was occupied by Grillo Bros, as a
store house. In tbe rear was a frame,
and this was occcupied by a single
man. He was called up at tbe early
hour named, aud went out, leaving
tbe lighted candle which caused the
fire. The roof of Cassinelli's was
also burned oh". There was no insur
ance on the property. For a time it
looked ns though Volcano was
doomed.
A Small fire,
The clangor of tho fire bell roused
the citizen jaat before noon Tuesday,
volume of smoke wasjseeu rising
from the northwest part of town, be
yond tbe brewery. It proved to be
tbe chicken bouse of Mrr James, on
premises of Miss Christina Kiekott. It
was some distance from the dwell
ing, and this fact saved the residence
from destruction. Tbe firemen got
out tbe hose, and got to tbe scene as
quickly as possible. The two-inch
hose i roved too short to reach Irom
the nearest hydrant to tbe burning
building, so tbe \% inch hose was
brought out. A small stream was
get to tbe flame?, but in tbe mean
time the fire had tumbled the build
ing to tbe ground. The presence of
water and firemen kept the flames
from extending to tbe dwelling. The
blaze started from a rubbish fire. The
damage was slight, not to exceed 150.
Teachers' Examination.
The annual meeting of tbe board
of education for tbe granting aud re
newing of teachers ceitictlates' com
menced in Jackson last Saturday.
On Monday the examination proper
was begun. There were 39 applicants
on hand; 33 ladies aud six male ap
plicants. It is the largest class that
Amador has nad tor many years.
Fully one halt ot those takiug tbe
examination are from points outside
of this county, Some have beeu at
tendiug normal school or univerisity,
and wish to become teachers to earn
sufficient to continue their studies.
Amador and Calavoras counties are
late with their teachers' examination
and this no doubt accouuts in a
measure for the influx of applicuuta
to theses counties. The board will
not get through with tbe examina
tion uutil to-morrow uight and it
may possibly extend into next. week.
There are also two applicants for
grummer grade diplomas.

youngest niece of the bride, the groom
being accompanied by Mrs H.
Thomas, the bride's mother. The
couple took their places under tbe
weddicg bell in oue corner of the
room, and tbe pastor of tbe Metbodist
Episcopal church, Key. Hugh Baker,
read the marriage service and pro
nounced them husband aud wife. It
was as delightful an occasion as has
taken place in Amador City for
some time. Only relatives of the
couple were present as guests, with
the exception of tbe minister and his
wife, and Miss Cora Wriggleswoith of
Jackson, an intimate triend of tbe
bride. The double parlors were de
corated in pink and green, and the
dining room in red. The bride was
pressed in white eolimne silk, winch
was later exchanged for a gray tailor
made traveling suit. The bridesmaid
wore a pearl gray dress of elimone
silk, tbe bride carrying a bouquet of
white carnations and the bridesmaid
a bouquet, of roses. After con
gratulations were said aud a few tears
mingled with happy laughter and
kisses, the company partook of a
bountiful wedding breakfast. ihe
bride and groom were showered with
rice by the rejoicing friends, and
drove to Martells to take the morn
ing train for Oakland and other coast
points. They were accompanied by a
number of tbe young ladies of the
company as far as Martells, each of
them anxious to catch the bride's
bouquet in order to bring the same
happy event speedily to them. This
honor fell jointly to Misses Lily and
Alice Thomas. The guests pteseut

Old Time Acting.
Tbe old time actor had peculiar niul
primitive views as to elocution and itrf
uses. I remember a certain old friend
of mine who, when he recited the open
ing speech in "Richard HI." and arrived
at the line, "In the deep bosom of tha
ocean buried," sugg^jfed the deep bos
om of the ocean by sending his voiea
Into his boots. Yet these were fine
actors, to whom certain young gentle
men who never saw them constantly
refer. The methods of the stage have
completely changed and with them the
tastes of the people. The probability
Is that some of the old actors of only
a few years ago would excite much
merriment in their delineation of trag
edy. A very great tragedian of a past
generation was wont in the tent sceua
in "Richard III." to hold a piece of
soap in his mouth, so that, after the ap
pearance of .the ghosts, the lather and
froth might dribble down his chin, and
he employed moreover a trick sword
which rattled hideously, and, what with
his foam flecked face, his rolling eyes,
his inarticulate groans and his rattling
blade, the small boy in the gallery
was seared into a frenzy of vociferous
delight!— Richard Mansfield in Atlantic
Proficient.
When western lowa was newly set
tled the farmers in an isolated section
banded themselves together as a school
district and proceeded to choose one ot
their number committeeman. A log
schoolhouse was erected, and soon a
young woman came that way seeking
a chance to teach. The committeeman
was designated to ascertain her fitness.
When the time for the ordeal arrived
the public official was at his wit's end.
He had been examined himself often
enough, but that was when he was at
tending district school fifty years be
fore. The very thought of conductinß
an examination himself, and for a
teacher at that, staggered him. H8
could not think of a question to ask.
The young woman sat waiting, and
the old man teetered nervously on lih
tiptoes.
"Well, now, Miss Burden," he said
cautiously at last, '"kin you say the
alphabet back'ards?"
Miss Burden could, and did.
"Fine!" cried the committeeman. "I'll
Just indorse your certificate." He
wrote It thus:
"Fully profeeshunt."
A Groat Stamp Forgery.
The most colossal stamp forgery on
record entailed the successful swin
dling of collectors throughout Europe
In ISS9. One day the French papers
announced that King Marie I. of Se
iang, an island in the vicinity of Chi
na, was coming to Taris. As it hap
pened, this self created monarch wag
an ex-offlcer of the French navy, and
his appearance in Paris created con
siderable sensation. . As soon as his
majesty had been duly "advertised"
sets of seven different postage stamps
marked "Sedang" and bearing three
balf moons appeared, and so great was
the demand for them that in less than
a month they realized 1,000 francs
each. Not until the king and his min
isters had reaped fat fortunes in this
manner was it discovered that the
whole thing was a hoax and the stamps
consequently worthless.
Some Slips of the Tongue.
Never use the word "liable" when
you mean "likely." Do not say, for
instance, that "he is liable to come in
at any moment." "Liable" implies mis
fortune and means "exposed to," "sub
ject to," "in danger of."
Why do most of us speak of "un
raveling a mystery?" Any good dic
tionary shows that "ravel" means "to
unweave." You "ravel" a mystery,
therefore, when you solve it. In "Haiu
let" Shakespeare says: "Make you to
ravel all this matter out."
If you and your friend Smith know a
man called Jones, do not speak to
Smith of "our mutual friend"—mean
ing Jones. Jones Is your common
friend. If you are friendly to Smith
and Smith is friendly to you, you and
Smith are "mutual friends," but that is
the only sense in which the term may
be rifrhtlr used.

Lincoln's Early Home Town Site
To Be Public Park.
William Kandolph Hearst has pur
chased and presented to the old Salem
chautauqua association at Petersburg
the site of the old village of New
Salem, to be converted into a national
park and kept forever as a memorial
of Abraham Lincoln, who once lived
there and kept store. The purchase
includes the site of tbe old store and
old mill, famous in history. The
purchase was completed yesterday,
and the price paid to the Baylee
estate, tbe present owners, was $12,
000. There are sixty acres in tbe site.
The announcement of tbe purchase
and donation waa made to-day at tbe
Old Salem cbautauqua, where the
editor made an address to a large
crowd. It was received with applause,
especially by tbe people of the city
of .Petersburg. Tbe place has been a
mecoa for pilgrims for yeais past.
Tbe village of New Salem has a
place in history from the fact that
it was tbe home of Abraham Lincoln
for six of tbe most eventful years in
his life. He arrived there as a young
man, a stranger, who had done noth
ing hitherto except to split rails and
to build a Hut boat and make a
journey thereon to New Orleans. At
New Salem Lincoln was a mill hand,
a storekeeper, a postmaster, a sur
veyor, a budding lawyer, a successful
candidate for the legislature. It was
from there that he went to Spring-
Held to enter upon his larger career.
New Salem was founded by James
Kur ledge and John Cameron, in 1829.
in that year they built a dam across
tbe Sangamon river and erected a
mill. Under date of October 23, 182P,
Reuben Harrison, surveyor, certified
that "at the request ot John Cameron,
one of the proprietors, 1 did survey
the town of New Salem." The town
within two years contained a dozen
or fifteen houses, nearly all of them
built of logs. New Salem's popula
tion probably never exceeded 100 per
sons. Its inhabitants and those of
the surrounding country were mostly
southerners— natives of Kentucky
and Tennessee— though there was an
occasional Yankee among them. The
place began to decline soon alter
Lincoln left it, in 1837. Petersburg
had sprung up two miles down tbe
river, and rapidly absorbed its
population and business. By 1840
New Salem was almost deserted. The
Kutledge taveru, the first house
erected, was tbe la&t to succumb. It
stood tor many years, but at last
crumbled . away. For many years
Saleni tiill has been only a cow
pasture.
Lincoln's first sight of tbe town
was in April, 1831, when he and his
crew were detained in getting their
flat boat over tbe Kutledge and Came
ron mill dams. Wben Lincoln walk
ed into New Salem three months later
he was remembered by many as the
ingenious flat boatman who had treed
his boat from tbe water, and thus
gotten itjaver the mill dam, by re
sorting to the extraordinary expedient
of boring a bole in the bottom. He
was to clerk for Denton Offutt, who
was to open a store; but Offutt's
gooda had not yet arrived, and Lin
coln spent some weeks in "loafing."
H« became an active citizen at once.
In August he was clerk of election.
He did odd joba, including the pilot
ing of a flat boat down the Sangamon
to the Illinois. After aome time
spent witb Oftutt, Lincoln, in part
nership with one William iSeiry,
bought all tbe stores in New Salem,
tbe youug men giving their notes,
neither baying any money. The
venture was unfortunate, Berry turn
ing out badly and Lincoln baying the
firm's debts to pay— a load he carried
for nearly twenty years. Wbile storey
keeper be was also postmaster and
surveyor. Lincoln's bent for politics
developed at once; he was a candidate
for the legislature tbe year after
his arrival at tbe frontier town,
being beaten. Ten years ago several
of Lincoln's contemporaries at New
Salem were living, but all are now
believed to be dead.— Globe Demo

THE AMADOR LEDGER; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. AUGUST 31, 1906.
Damon and Pythias
[Original.]
"I am happy to 'neet you, Mr. King,
though I know you consider that I havti
robbed you during your absence of your
bosom friend; consequently you are
anything but happy to meet me."
"Really"—
"Don't tell any polite f;)lseli3D;ls. It
will do no good. I know of the devo
tion between you and Earle — that you
expected ou your return to find that
he still belonged to you, that instead
you find In me a wedge between you
and him— that you are prepared to hate
me."
"I assure you you wrong me. On the
contrary"—
"Here is the proof. In this letter,
written to Earle as soon as you heard
of his marriage, you say" —
"Please dou't read it I was a fool to
write such stuff. Of course Earle hed
a perfect right to marry, and had I
been in his place I should have" —
"Never mind these bits of conven
tional flattery; they will do no good.
I am going to try and capture my en
emy. Earle has just left for the Pa
cific coast, to be gone dear knows how
long. Meanwhile I am going to try to
take his place with his best friend. I
shall play Damon, with a view to mak
ing you my Pythias. Earle went away
crushed at your cruel letter. I prom
ised "that when he returned he should
find we three a trio, though one of us
Is a woman."
Earle Warren was absent ten weeks,
and the day before his return there was
another conversation between those he
bad left behind.
"You are my evil genius."
"Your evil genius?" she asked hi a
tone far from indicating that she was
offended.
"Yes, I came home expecting to find
my friend. He had passed into your
possession. Then under pretext of
making a trio of friends you have
made me the lover of my friend's
wife."
The lady smiled.
"You have made a wreck of me,
and now you laugh at me."
"Men have died, but not for love."
"Honorable men have done dishon
orable things for love."
"I would delight to make you turn
against your friend for me. I should
know myself to be loved as I wish to
be loved."
"You are a devil."
"You say I have made you one. We
are well mated."
"It only remains to consummate a
double villainy. Will you fly with me
before Earle returns?"
She turned away with bent head.
He wondered at this first display of
conscience she had made since they
met. ,
"Now you have your victim within
your toils," he said, "you hesitate to
crush him."
"Come tomorrow night at 10. Earle
returns a little later. If I have made
you bad I will be as bad as you."
At the appointed hour the next night
Stanton King drove in a carriage to
the house of Earle Warren. It was
Damon going to rob Pythias of his
wife. He knew that a woman who
would play such a part must be a very
devil, but it seemed the greater the
devil the greater her power over him.
He drove up to her door just as a
town clock struck the hour of 1 ).
Jumping from his carriage, he ran up
to the door. It was opened by the
lady herself.
"Come in," she said. "We have plen
ty of time."
"But I expected you would be dress
ed for the journey."
"The journey to the realms of Sa
tan?"
"If there were a worse place I would
follow you there."
A sound of wheels without and a
carriage drove up behind the one that
was waiting. Some one alighted and
came up the steps. The lady who
was to run away with her husband's
friend threw herself on a sofa and
buried her face in the cushions. A man
entered and stood for a moment look-
Ing at the couple. He was Earle War
ren. Following him was a young and
beautiful woman.
"Stanton," he said gayly.
Stanton King reeled and was about
to fall when his friend caught him in
his arms.
"Stanton, old man, it's all right.
We've put up a job on you. That's
not my wife; It's my wife's cousin,
Emma Steele. The women did it. I
told them It would be a shame, but
they wanted to make a quartet of us
all. This is my wife. Ellen, this is
my best friend, Stantorl" King. You
don't have to elope, old man. You
shall be married from this house."
King turned and looked at the wom
an on tbe sofa. She arose and cast a
quick glance at him — a glance to know
if she would be punished for what she
had done. King started to leave the
house. At the door he turned for a
last glance and saw the woman who
had deceived him ready to sink back
pale and trembling on the sofa. Rush-
Ing to her, he caught her In his arms.
There was a clapping of hands on the
part of Mr. and the real Mrs. Warren,
and a shower of congratulations, min
gled with taunts on the part of the
latter. Miss Steele, disengaging her
self from King, held up her hands
deprecatingly and said:
"I know that I alone could have
made a villain of this honorable man.
We have succeeded In our scheme,
and God forgive me for my part in it.
I shall atone for it with a life of de
votion."
And she did.

Weddings In Wales.
Many and curious were the old cus
toms in Wales relating to marriage.
The following is nn s\<xount of the bid
ding ceremony, an old custom which 13
said to be celebiated even to this day
In rural parts of Wales: The bidder
goes from house to house with a long
pole and ribbons flying at the end of it,
and standing In the middle floor in each
house he repeats a long lesson with
great formality. He mentions the day
of the wedding, the place, the prepara
tions made, etc. The following Is a
specimen: "The Intention of the bidder
Is this: With kindness and amity, with
decency and liberality for and ,
he invites you to come with your good
will on the plate. Bring current mon
ey—a shilling or two or three or four
or five— with cheese and butter. We
Invite the hUsband and wife, children
and nienservants, from the greatest to
the least. Come there early. You
shall have victuals freely and drink
cheap, stools to sit on and fish if we
can catch them, but if not hold us ex
cusable, and they will attend on you
when you call upon them in return.
They set out from such a place and
such a place."
A Bride's Dilemma.
A successful schoolteacher married a
wealthy widower. The man had lived
alone with his servants since the death,
of his first wife. On the morning aft
er the bride's arrival in her new home
the cook appeared for orders. Now,
the little woman was far more familiar
with the classics than with roasts and
stews, and she was not a little dismay
ed when Mary innocently put the ques
tion:
"An' how will ye have the beef cook
ed, mum?"
For the merest Instant she hesitated.
Not for a fortune would she have the
old servant suspect her absolute ig
norance of cookery. But her years in
the schoolroom had not been in vain.
Calmly and sweetly she answered:
"You may cook it your way today,
Mary, and then another time you can
try my way."
And the cook went downstairs with
a high opinion of her new mistress.—

Superstitions of Farmers.
Farmers . "stick to the moon" In re
gard to planting corn and other crops.
Some of them will not under any cir
cumstances plant ' corn on moonlight
nights, claiming that corn planted then
will produce a tall stalk with a short
ear. Others just as successfully plant
when they are ready, when nights are
dark or moonlight, as the case may be.
Other notions are indulged in, such as
throwing the cobs In running water to
keep corn from firing. Some farmers
would under no consideration burn
pinder hulls, the seed of which Is to be
used for planting. They must be scat
tered along a path or highway, to be
trodden upon In order to secure a good
crop. Green butter bean hulls must be
thrown in a road after being shelled
for table use 'from day to day to insure
a good crop the following season. —

Any One Can Spell Shakespeare.
One is not in danger of misspelling
the word Shakespeare. Some one has
discovered 4,000 ways, of which the
following, as they actually appear In
old documents, are examples; Shak

authority twenty-two of these ways
are correct.
A Nation of Sleepers.
"Rare slumberers are the Turks," de
clares a writer. "In the villages, at
any rate, they will drop into the land
of dreams on the slightest pretext and
at the shortest notice. This habit has
advantages, one being that the Turk
does not at all mind being awakened
In the dead of night, for the simple rea
son that he can go to sleep again the
Instant he wishes. When staying In
very limited quarters I have often
heard a member of the family get up
and after searching about among hla
sleeping companions thoroughly rouse
them all to ask where his tobacco was
or upon some equally slight excuse."
Enough Money.
Half a dozen brokers were discuss

when one of them told this story: The
financier was once asked, "When does
a man get enough money, Mr. Sage?"
"When he gets $10,000 more," said Un
cle Russell as he stopped at un apple
stand for a moment. Then he passed
on without buying.
His Part.
"Look here," remarked the thrifty
man to his extravagant wife, "you're
carrying too much sail, my lady."
"I don't know why you should both
er about that," she retorted.
"No?" said he. "I think I should,
since I have to raise the wind,"
Brought Down the House.
Critic — I hear that the new man's act-
Ing brought down the house. Manager
—Yes, It did. In one week it brought
down the house from 800 to 10 people
and the attendants.

Doctor (entering suddenly)— Which
of you has waited longest? Shears

The First Son.
Nodd— l can't make up my mind

Nearly three weeks.
Love.
We never can say why we love, but
only that we love. The heart is ready
enough at feigning excuses for all that
it does or Imagines of wrong, but ask
it to give a reason for any of its beau
tiful and divine motives, and it can
only look upward and be dumb.—Low

A Kindly Provision of Nature.
"The codfish," said the professor,
"lays considerably more than 1,000,
000 eggs."
"It is mighty lucky for the codfish
that she doesn't have to cackle over
every egg," said the student who came
from a farm.

He Had Already <<Et."
"I know a western Kansas town
where tlie rules of etiquette are purely
opoii a logical basis," said a man from
the short grass country the other day.
"The daughter of the hotel keeper at
whose hostelry I was living was to be
married. I received an invitation. At
about 11 o'clock in the evening the
wedding supper was spread. An old
lady came down the table side, passing
the viands to the guests. When she
reached my plate she skipped me and
began again with the next man. The
old lady had seen me eating my sup
per as usual at G o'clock.
" 'You've et,' she said as she gave
me the go by. Things begau to look
dubious for me. Then an old man
came along with more food. He also
had seen me eating at the usual even
ing hour. He shied around me with a
look of surprise that I should be at the
feed rack again and said, 'Why, you've
et.'
"Everybody had been 'saving up' for
the occasion so that they might eat like
heroes at that wedding feast. The fact
that I had not been missing any meals
nearly ostracized me in that happy
gathering." — Kansas City Timeo.
The Fate of Cities.
Some ancient cities have disappear
ed. The archaeologist digs through the
sands of the desert, the accumulations
of vegetable mold and the debris of
human habitation in a search for the
palaces of great kings, the markets of
wealthy traders and the homes of a
once numerous people. The massacres
of ancient warfare may explain some
of these dead and buried cities. The
inability of people in early history to
deal with the sanitary problems of a
congested population may have been a
contributing cause to their destruction.
Cities may have died because their
people could not live. But in most
cases a change in the routes of com
merce will be found to have diverted
the stream of nourishment from a city
and left it to die of starvation. Yet
the Eternal City and Athens, Byzan
tium, Jerusalem, Antioch and Damas
cus illustrate the tenacity of munici
pal vitality, even though a long suc
cession of centuries brings great
changes In the methods and subjects
and courses of traffic— Philadelphia
Record.
Herbert Spencer.
A queer instance of the working of
Herbert Spencer's mind is mentioned
by the two sisters In whose household
he lived. He came to the table one day
absorbed in thinking about some pho
tographs of the nebulae he had just
received:
"As he rose from his chair he stood
for a minute gazing with gleaming eyes
into the distance, and then muttered In
a disjointed fashion, as if half to him
self, words to this effect: 'Thirty mil
lions of suns, each probably having its
own system, and supposing them each
to be the size of a pin's head they are
fifty miles apart! What does it all
mean?' Anil then, without a pause
and only a change of voice, 'The fluff
still comes out of that cushion, you
know,' as with a wave of his small,
thin hand toward it he passed rapidly
out of the room, leaving us both be
wildered by the quickness with which
his mind worked."
A Heavy Sample,
Sometimes the rigors of patent office
procedure are not without their humor
ous side. A New York attorney filed
an application for improvements In a
centrifugal pump. The patent office
declared the invention inoperative and
demanded a working model. The pat
ent office was requested to send an ex
aminer to Trenton to Inspect the ma
chine in actual operation. This the
patent office refused to do. The at
torney, therefore, politely sent a seven
ton pump to the patent office— sent It,
moreover, from Trenton to satisfy a
skeptical examiner. Twenty-one men
were required to get it into the exam
iner's office. — Scientific American.
Titles In Germany.
The question of title is one of the
most delicate In Germany, a fact of
which the stranger Is constantly re
minded in intercourse with the people,
particularly with the women. Frau
Professor, Frau Director, Frau Doctor,
are most particular about their hus
band's titles being attached to their
own names, but when it comes to mili
tary circles It Is different, and both
men and women protest vigorously
against this sharing of titles. Lieuten
ant yon B. objocts to having his wife
addressed as Frau Lieutenant, which
title belongs as well to the wife of
Lieutenant Schmidt or Haff of a less
aristocratic regiment.
The Most Carious Known Animal.
The most peculiar and remarkable
animal in the world is the Ornithoryn
chus paradoxus, the famed egg laying
mammal of Australia. It is shaped like
an otter, has fur like a beaver, is web
footed like a swam, has a bill like a
duck and a tail like that of a fox. It
is the only known fur covered creature
that lays eggs. A corresponding odd
ity among feathered bipeds would be n
bird that brought forth its young alive.
Same Thins.
"Rimer takes himself very seriously,
doesn't he?"
"Yes, indeed."
"Most of his poetry is pathetic, isn't
ft?"
"That's what he calls it. but the edi
tors say it's pitiful."— Boston Adver
tiser.
Impatience.
Impatience turns an ague into a fe
ver, a fever to the plague, fear Into de
spair, anger into rage, loss into mad
ness and aorrow to amazement.—Jer
emy Taylor.
The best education in the world is
:hiit got by straggling to make a liv
mg.—Wendell Phillips,
The Real Simon Pore.
"The real simou pure" is one of those
phrases which every one understands
and not one in a hundred could account
for. Simon Pure was a Pennsylvania
Quaker in Mrs. Centlivre's "A BolJ
Stroke For a Wife," produced at Drury
Lane theater, London, in February.
1718. One Colonel Feignwell passes
himself off as Simon and wins the heart
of a Bristol heiress, Miss Lovely, after
which the real Simon Pure turns up.
The Weather Prophet.
"How are-you coming on with your
Bew system of weather prediction ?"
"Well," answered the prophet cheeri
ly, "I can always get the kind .of
weather all right, but I haven't quite
succeeded in hitting the dates exactly."

more than one discoverer. Great ideas
