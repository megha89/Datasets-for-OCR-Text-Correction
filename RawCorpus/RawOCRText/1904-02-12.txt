But how about the children ?
Are they fed according to

are soft and undeveloped, a
flesh and muscle food if they
are thin and weak and a blood

LONDON'S GRASSHOPPER.
For Nearly Three and a Half Cents-
rles a Famous Landmark.
The golden grasshopper on tbe towei
of the Royal Exchange has been foi
nearly three and a half centuries a
London landmark as familiar as tbe
cross on St. Paul's or the dragon on
Bow church steeple.
Sir Thomas Gresham, a royal agent
in three successive reigns, founded the
exchange in the reign of Elizabeth. He
erected at his own expense a beautiful
structure in the Flemish style of archi
tecture, with shops on the first floor. A
bell tower crowned by a huge grass
hopper stood on one side of tbe chief
entrance. The bell in this tower sum
moned the merchants at 12 o'clock noon
and C o'clock evening. During, the great
fire of IGG6 the building was totally de
stroyed. The statues of kings and
queens which ornamented the corridors
were precipitated into the enormous cel
lars and with them the tower and
grasshopper.
Gresham was loyally loved by the
metropolis, and his generous ' services
were not forgotten. From the moun
tain of debris the grasshopper was res
cued, and it was placed— a lofty vane
of gilt brass— above the new dome sup
ported by eight Corinthian columns,
and to this hour it swings to tbe points
of the compass, perpetuating the sign
and crest of the Gresham family. The
old clock in this tower had four dials
and chimed four times daily, on Sunday,
the One Hundred and Fourth Psalm;
on Mgnday, "God Save the King;" on
Tuesday, "Waterloo March;" on Wed
nesday, "There's Nae Luck Aboot the
Hoose;" on Thursday, "See, the Con
quering Hero Comes;" on Friday, "Life
Let Us Cherish," and on Saturday,
"Foot Guards' March." In 183S fire
again devastated the stately building,
beginning soon after 10 at night, and
by next morning the clock tower alone
was standing. It is significant that the
last air played by the chimes before
they went crashing through the tower
roof, crushing the entrance arch below,
was "There's Nae Luck Aboot the
Hoose;" then the eight bells ceased
their clanging.
Tho grasshopper was unharmed and
to this clay remains, eleven feet of
shimmering metal, looking down from
its perch 108 feet above the busy
streets, — Julian King Colford in St.
Nicholas,

A CHAT WITH A POET
THE STORY OF AN INTERESTING
EVENING WITH LONGFELLOW.
How "EiceUlor," the "Wreck of the
llcHperuH" and the "Old Clock on
the Stair" Came to Be Written.
"The Ilridge" Win Born of Sorrow.
I once wrote to the poet Longfellbw
asking him to give me some account of
the circumstances under which he
wrote "The Bridge"— "l stood "on the
bridge at midnight" — a poem which an
eminent English critic has called "the
most sympathetic in this language."
I received in return a cordial note from
the poet "in which be said, "If you w4ll
come over and pass au evening • with
me it will give me pleasure to tell you
the history of the poem and also of any
of my poems tbat may interest you." jj
A few evenings later found me at the
poet's door at his Cambridge home. He
was then verging on seventy years, In
thje f ulluess of his experience and the
ripeness of his fame. I was shown lu
to a long, hall-like room, dimly lighted,
in which were a broad table, antique
furniture and a tall colonial clock. The
poet was, there alone. He arose to
meet me and formed a striking 'and
'statuesque figure, with his kindly smile
and long white hair :md beard.
"And so you would like to know
something about the Inspiration of
some of my poems— what led me to
write them?" he said when we were
seated. "Well,' you are very kind.
"I .will tell you first how I came to
write the 'Psalm of Life.' I was a
young man then. I cau recall the
time. It was a bright day, and the
trees were blooming, and I felt an Im
pulse to write out my aim and purpose
In the world. I wrote it for myself.
I did not intend it for publication.
Some months afterward I was asked
for a poem by a popular magazine. I
recalled my 'Psalm of Life.' I copied
it and sent It to the periodical. It saw
the light, took wings and flew over the
world. There you may see it written
on a Japanese screen."
He pointed to a high, richly orna-.
mented screen which stood before a
great fireplace. He added an anecdote
which I have always regarded as a
true picture of his soul:
"When I was In England I was hon
ored by receiving an invitation from
the queen. As I was leaving the pal
ace yard my carriage was hindered by
the crowd of vehicles. There came to
the door of the coach a noble looking
English workingnian.
"'Are you Professor Longfellow?' he
said. ■•;• ? ;
"I bowed.
" 'May I ask, sir. if you wrote the
"Psalm of Life?" '
?'I answered that I did.
" 'Would you be willing, sir. to take
a workiugman by the band?"
"I extended my band to him. He
clasped it, and never In my life have I
received a compliment which gave me
so much satisfaction.
"I wrote 'Excelsior,' " he continued,
"after receiving a letter full of lofty
sentiments from Charles Sunnier at
Washington. In one of the sentence?
occurred the word 'excelsior.' As 1
dropped the letter that word again
paught my eye. I turned over the let
ter and wrote my poom. I .wrote the
'Wreck of the Hesperus' because, after
reading an account of the loss of a part
of the Gloucester fishing licet in aD
autumn storm, I met the words 'Xor
nian's woe.' I retired for the nij?lit aft
er reading tho' report 'of the disaster,
but the scene haunted me. I arose to
write, and the poem came to me in
whole stanzas.
"The clock in the corner of the room."
he went ou, "is not the one to which \
refer in iriy 'Old Clock on the Stair/
That clock stood in the country house
pf my father-in-law at Pittsfield. among
the Berkshire hills."
The great clock in the room was hen !>
ing the air in the shadows as he spolco
I could seem to hear It say:
"Toujours— jamais!
Jamais — toujours!"
It was these words by a French au
thor that had suggested to him tli»
solemn refrain:
"Forever— never!
Never— forever!"
"Excelsior" had been set to popular
music by the Hutcliiusons wbeu the
poet met one evening the minstrel fam
ily after a concert in lioston Music
hall. "I have," be said, '•another poevo
which I will send to you." lie did sn.
It was the first copy of the "Old Clock
on the Stair." One of the family set
the words to music.
"My poem entitled 'The Bridge,' " he
said In effect, "was written in sorrow,
which made me feel for the loneliness
of others. I was a widower at the
time, and I used to sometimes go over
the bridge to Boston evenings to meet
friends and to return near midnight by
the same way. The way was silent
save here and there a belated footstep.
The sea rose and fell among the wood
en piers, and there was a great furnace
on the Brighton hills whose red light
was reflected by the waves. It was on
such a late, solitary wa^k tbat the spir
it of the poem came upon me. The
bridge has been greatly altered, but
the place of it is the same."— Hezeklnn
Butterworth in American Author.
Ilia Economical Way.
"My husband has strange Ideas of
economy."
"How is that?"
"Why, he seems to think he saves
money by drinking so much at the club
that he has no appetite for breakfast."
—Chicago Tost.
Always Gets the Lnttt Word.
"Say, pa," queried little Billy Bloo
bumper, "what's an echo?"
"An echo, my son," . replied the old
man, with a sigh long drawn out, "is
the only thing that can flimflam a wo
man out of the last word."— Lyre.

CAUSES OF COLDS.
One of the Moat Common of Them Is
Eatlngr Too Much.
The invariable cause of colds comes
i from within, not without No one takes
cold when in a vigorous state of health,
with pure blood coursing through the
body, and there is no good reason why
any one in ordinary health should have
a cold. It may. come from Insufficient
exercise, breathing of foul air, want of
wholesome food, excess of food, lack of
bathing, etc., but always from some
violation of the plain laws of health.
There can be no more prolific cause
of colds than highly seasoned foods as
well as frequent eating. These give no
time for the digestive organs to rest
and incite an increased flow of the di
gestive secretions. Thus larger quanti
ties of nourishment are absorbed than
can be properly utilized, and the result
.is an obstruction, commonly called a
"cold," which is simply an effort of the
system to expel the useless material.
Properly speaking, it is self poisoning,
due to an incapability of the organism
to regulate and compensate for the. dis
turbance.
A deficient supply of pure air to the
lungs is not only a stroug predisposing
cause of colds, but a prolific. source of
much graver conditions. Pure air and
exercise are necessary to prepare the
system /or the assimilation of nutri
ment, for without them there can be no
vigorous health. The oxygen of the
air we breathe regulates the appetite
as well as the nutriment that Is built
np in the system.
The safest and best way to avoid
colds is to sleep in a room with the
windows wide open and to remain out
of doors every day, no matter what
may be the weather, for at least two
hours, preferably with some kind of
exercise, if no more than walking. One
should not sit down to rest while the
feet are wet or the clothing damp. A
person may go with the clothing wet
through, to the skin all day if he but
keeps moving. Exercise keeps up the
circulation and prevents taking cold.
The physiologic care of colds is the
prevention of the occurrence. The per
son who does not carry around an over
supply of alimentation in his system
and furthermore secures a purified cir
culation by strict, sanitary cleanliness,
thus placing himself In a positive con
dition, is immune to colds. A starving
man cannot take cold.
A careful diet would exclude the use
of all narcotics and all food that ls not
thoroughly appropriated. An overfed
person is worse off than one who is un
derfed, because the overfed body is
taxed to dispose of what cannot be ap
propriated and, when not properly dis
posed of, remains only to be an element
of danger.— Science pf Health.
Folaononn and Harmless Snakes.
There is a certain physiological dif
ference between the poisonous and
harmless snakes which exists very
plainly in their manner of dentition.
All snakes are objects of aversion and
dread to mankind, so much so that to
be bitten by a snake has at times been
so fearful to the victim as to have pro
duced death although the snake was
harmless. Such ls the instinctive dread
with which these reptiles are thought
of that U may be desirable to have
some easy mode of distinguishing the
one kind from the other. This distin
guishing characteristic is afforded by
the teeth. In all poisonous snakes
there are only two rows of teeth, the
fang or fangs being arranged either
within the two rows or outside of them.
The harmless snakes have four distinct
rows of teeth, and when the bite shows
this kind of wound and not any single
deeper or larger puncture there need
be no apprehension.
Walking For Malaria.
Obstinate cases of malaria that have
withstood the opeai} voyages, mountain
heights and quinine dosing are said to
have been conquered by systematic and
continued walking. What the malarial
p.Jent wants most to do is to sit in
doors, nurse his aches and pains or to
He down and doze. Advocates of the
walking cure maintain that fresh air is
an antidote not only to the malaria it
self, but to the blues, which usually
accompanies it. Their advice to the
sufferer is to dress up warmly if the
weather Ja damp or rainy and go out to
walk. Wear flannel next to the skin,
stout shoes* and simple hat. If it is
warm, dress lightly, but carry a wrap
to throw around the shoulders against
drafts and too rapid cooling off. When
one comes to think of it, there are few
maladies on earth that fresh air and
moderate exercise are uqt good for.
The Spectroscope.
Originally the spectroscope was ap
plied only to chemistry, and in that
limited field proved Itself an invalu
able aid in accurate analysis. By hold
ing In a Bunsen flame a platinum wire
moistened by contact with the skin the
presence of a few grains of salt swal
lowed a few minutes previously can be
detected, with, the spectroscope. In
deed, so wonderfully refined is the
work of the spectroscope chemist that
he can discover in a substance the pres
ence of one three-millionth of a grain
of metal.
Didn't See Them.
"How did your nephew's wedding
pass off?"
"Just splendid."
"Were there any contretemps?"
"I don't think so. I didn't see any.
You see, we had the church thoroughly
cleaned up before the wedding took
place."— Cleveland Plain Dealer.
Their ll*ate.
"Their marriage was a hasty affair,
I understand."
"Yes, Indeed. They told the minister
to hurry, as they had engaged a cab
wan by the hour."— Judge.
Custom may lead a man Into many
irrors, but It Justifies none.— Fielding.

LETTER FROM ALASKA.
Rampart, Alaska, Dec. 18, 1903.
Dear Ledger:—
It is just half past two. I have
lighted the lamp, put the canvas
blinds on the outside of the windows
to keep the frost from accumulat
ing on the "lass and destroying ihe
view during the four hours of day
light, which is all we get during the
holiday season. The weather is
simply grand. Since the cold snap
in November, when we had a taste
of 42 degrees below zero, 'it has
ranged from 5 degrees below to 18
degrees above, very little wind and
no heavy snowstorms. The town is
quiet, but the numerous dog teams
and sleighs, drawn by from one to
four horses, hauling machinery and
supplies to the creeks, prove that
the country is by no means dead.
Several hydraulic plants will be put
in operation next summer, which
will probably revolutionize the work
ing of ground about here. Hydraul
icing can only be done four months
in the year, but ground is worked
by hand all the year round, the pay
dirt being piled up during the winter
and washed when warm weather
comes. At present most of the min
ing is done by hand, a shaft being
sunk to bedrock and the pay dirt
hoisted by a bucket and windlass,
after being thawed either by piling
wood against the face of the drift
and burning it, or by . steam forced
through pipes from a boiler above
ground. There are no fabulously
rich claims in this region, but a man
who has less than two thousand dol
lars for a season's work, after pay
ing all expenses, feels that he must
look for a richer pla<"e next year.
Many, however, do not make ex
penses, and it is this eager uncer
tainty that makes one of the chief
charms of life on a mining frontier.
Laborers get $5 a day and board.
Supplies here are not as high as one
would expect. Flour is 10c a pound,
sugar 12Je, butter in air tight cans,
$1.25 for 2 lbs., potatoes 10c a
pound, a drink or a cigar 25c, meals
in restaurants $1.00, lodging $1.00.
Reports from the Tanana district,
160 miles from here, continue to get
better, and it is the general belief
that it will rank with Dawson and
Nome when developed. At present
it costs 25c a pound to get supplies
hauled there from Rampart or Circle
City. The Alaska Central R. R.
now under construction from Cooks
Inlet to Atwood, in the center of the
Tanana district, will opeu up the
whole interior of Alaska, and make
it possible -to work thousands of
claims at a profit, that are now idle
on account of the high prices of sup
plies and labor. C. H. G.

The Soldier's Idle Time.
Military life is necessarily made rip
largely of loafing. You cannot keep a
man continuously at drilling, marching
or any other branch of military train
ing for eight hours a day and five or
six days a week. You have to invent a
great many other jobs for him, even to
make a pretense of keeping him occu
pied. But these jobs are nearly all
"loafing" jobs, and when it is all done
the soldier has a great many more idle
hours on his hands per diem than any
other man in the same rank of life. I
do not know whether it is possible to
arrive at any remedy for this, but, if
it is, the direction in which I should
look for the remedy would be to make
every soldier work at some other trade
for a certain number of hours each
day.- The number of hours might be
shorter in the summer, when there is
more opportunity for training and mili
tary exercise, and longer in the winter.
If this were practicable, no doubt It
would make an enormous difference to
the value of the soldier as a citizen
when he leaves the ranks. — London
Truth.
Catbirds and Black Snake.
A writer in the Scientific American
says: "I witnessed a pair of catbirds
making a bold defense against a black
snake bent on devouring the contents
of their nests. At first the snake was
inclined to disregard the distressed
birds as they fought to drive it away,
but the blows of their wings and bills
became so annoying that the thief had
to seek refuge in flight. On reaching
the roots of the tree, from which the
river had washed the dirt, the snake
started to climb, only to be driven be
neath them and then out to an old
stump, under which the baffled and
beaten reptile took refuge."

A Leiiaon In the Use of Simple Term*
In Letter "Writing-.
A few months ago the son of a rail
way director was through his father's
influence given a position of some Im
portance on a large railway. He was
fresh from Cambridge, and In the or
ders which he from time to time Issued
to the men under him always made use
of the longest, most unusual words.
This habit led to some rather expen
sive blunders, and, the matter coming
before the general manager, he wrote
the young ofliclal the following letter:
"In promulgating your esoteric cogi
tations and in articulating your super
ficial sentimentalities and amicable phil
osophical or psychological observations'"
beware of platitudinous ponderosity.
Let your conversational communication
possess a clarified conciseness, a com
pacted comprehensibleness, a coales
cent consistency and a concatenated
cogency. Eschew all conglomeration of
flatulent garrulity, jejune babblement
and asinine affectation. Let your ex
temporaneous descant inga and ' unpre
meditated expatlatlon have intelligibil
ity and veracious vivacity, without rho
domontade or thrasonical bombast
Sedulously avoid all polysyllabic pro
fundity, ventrlloqulal verbosity and
vaniloquent vapidity. Shun double en
tendre, prurient jocosity and pestifer
ous profanity, obscurant or apparent
Tn other words, talk plainly, briefly,
naturally, sensibly, purely and truth
fully. Don't put on airs; say what you
mean; mean what you say, and don't
use big words."

hint and changed his style.— London

W Our sole knowledge of the peo- i 3
¥ pie on other worlds and how far h
' the people there differ from our \
inhabitants, can only be guessed by
comparison with animal nature on this
small sphere of ours. More important
to as is a knowledge of ourselves.
"Know Thyself" was an old ' Greek
thought. How to take care of one's
own body is not so simple as some think ;
the human mechanism is a wonderful
thing and requires watching.
One man who has done more to teach
the American people how to care for their
bodies than almost any other, is Dr. R. V.
Pierce, of Buffalo, N. V., the Author of the
"Common Sense Medical Adviser." He
says : It is not the quantity of the food
eaten which produces strength and health
(for some people can keep strong on a very
meagre diet), but it is how much food is
absorbed and assimilated by the blood and
carried to nourish every organ of the body.
It is, therefore, vitally necessary for the
body that the stomach be in a healthy
state. If disease of the stomach, or what is
called "stomach trouble," prevents proper
nutrition then the heart, liver, lungs, and
kidneys do not get proper food— they are
not fed on rich red blood, and in conse-
quence, begin to show signs of distress.
Outwardly these signs may be pimples
and eruptions on skin, pale face, sleepless
nights, tired, languid feelings, or, by reason
of the nerves not being fed on pure blood,
they become starved, and we receive a
warning in the pain we call neuralgia.
Rheumatism, too, is a blood disease. After
years of practice and study Dr. Pierce
found that an Alterative Extract, which he
named "Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Dis-
covery, " made from the extracts of several
plants, invariably produced a tonic effect
upon the system. It helped the process of
absorption of the healthy elements in the
food and increased the red corpuscles of
the blood, as well as eliminated the poisons
from the system.

aches. Constipation causes them. Doct ->?

FOR INCORPORATION.
The Ledger now urges npon the
people of Jackson the desirability of
incorporating the town as a city of
the sixth class. It would be well to
take immediate action in this direc
tion. There is no doubt that under
the circumstances now existing, in
corporation will carry. The princi
pal reasons that prevailed against
the incorporation three years ago,
r. v no longer exist. At that time it
was the custom, sanctioned by law,
that business men in incorporated
towns were liable to the county li
cense. That is the municipal license
was an additional tax upon the busi
ness interests. The only county
burdens they were relieved from by
incorporation were the road tax levy
and the road poll tax. Instead of
\ paying money for road purposes for
the county, they paid a street tax
for town purposes. Since the last
election, however, the law has been
: changed, and no county license can
be imposed within the town limits.
Incorporation now means that the
revenue from, road tax, poll taxes
and licenses, is diverted from the
county treasury to the municipal
treasury, forming the aiain support
of the town government. Now let us
see how this revenue would pan out.
An examination of the records
shows the revenue contributed by
Township No. 1 from these various
sources to be about as follows:
, Assessable property in Jack
son school district $807,
520 at 50c on the $100 now
levied for road purposes. . 4035 00
Road Poll taxes collected
Township 1 1300 00
County licenses Twp 1 3200 00
Total $8535 00
Making all allowances for the fact
that the proposed incorporation
would not include all the territory
of Jackson school district, and also
a liberal deduction for the licenses
collected from business places in
township one that would ! be outside
the proposed town Units, it may be
safely reckoned that $7000 would be
raised for town purposes without in
creasing the burdens of the property
holders one jot. With conservative
management this ought to leave from
$3000 to $4000 available for perma
neut improvement each year — which
is far more than Jackson now gets
from the county government system.^
Above and beyond all, "Jackson iu
corporated would enjoy the privilege
of atteudingto its own affairs, which
is now denied her. Let the move
ment be started at once, so as to
secure a verdict at the polls before
the new license ordinance goes into
effect.
REREGISTRATION NECESSARY.
It* is well to impress upon the
voters of Amador county that every
citizen in order to vote at the com
ing presidential election must be re
registered. The great register used
at the last general election has been
cancelled by order of the board of
supervisors. The general law re
quires a new registration of voters
for every general election— that
means every two years. The re
quirement is no doubt very . nec
essary in the large centers of popu
lation, but for counties like Amador
where the changes all told will not
amount to more than 300 or 400
names, it is in the nature of a hard
ship. Years ago Amador held on
to its old great register from one
election to another until there were
nearly as many dead and absent per
sons on the voting roll as actual
voters. This left the door open for
fraud, and the evil was at length
abolished. Now, we are drifting to
the other extreme. A new register
every four years would meet all the
demands in fully one half the coun
ties in the state. To re- register all
the voters at every election involves
much time and expense; it entails
hardship upon many citizens, and
has been the cause of several to lose
their votes. However, such is the
law, and it is well for every voter of
Amador county to understand that
he muat make a new application to
get on the register this year, other
wise he will be apt to lose his vote
at tho coming presidential election.
Evpry person having business at the
county seat should make it a point
to call at the county clerk's office
and make the necessary affidavit of
registration. Don't delay this mat
tor until the rush of the campaign
is fairly on.
SUPREME COURT DECISION
Supervisors have no right to Allow Ad
ditional Clerical Force at Public Ex
pense.
The supreme court has rendered a
decision in the case of W. E. Agard
of San Diego against EJ Shaffe, as
auditor of San Diego county, which
holds as unlawful the acts of boards
of supervisors in employing addi->
tional clerical force, at public ex
pense, to assist county recorders in
preparing abstracts of mortgages to
be furnished to county assessors
pursuant to section 3678 of the po
litical code. In the case cited above
the board of supervisors authorized
the county recorder to employ Agard
for the work mentioned above, and
allowed his claim of $1304. The
auditor, however, refused to draw
his warrant on the county treasurer
for the payment of the ' same, aud
Agard resorted to litigation to com
pel the auditor to draw the warrant.
The superior court rendered a de
cision ordering the warrant drawn,
but the auditor appealed the case to
the supreme court and that tribunal
has upheld his contentions.
■ The supervisors acted under sec
tion 3678 of the political code, which
empowers them to provide for the
paymeutof such additional clerical
force as may be required to enable
the couuty recorders to <"<>mply with
the provisions of this section.
The court, however, holds that this
section of the codo is in conflict with
section 5 article 4 of the constitu
tion, taking advantage of which a
board of supervisors could at will'
fix, to some extent, the compensa
tion of the recorder, which power to
fix the compensation of county offi
cers rests, under the constitution,
solely with the legislature.— Solauo
Republican.
The W. E. Agard referred to in
the above whs formerly a resident of
Jnckson, and married to a young
lady of this town, Miss Clara Kent.
They left this county some fifteen
years ago, and have since made Uieir
home in the southern county. The
decision is of much interest to all
counties in the state. Without the
express sanction of law, the super
visors have no authority to eutail
expense for extra help for any of the
county officers at the cost of the
public treasury.

head was a solid mass of scabs, and its
hair all came out. I tried many reme
dies but none seemed to do any per
manent good until I used De Witt's

cured,' the scabs are gone, and the little

chief deputy, will probably throw new
light on tho subject of the meadow lark.
It reads as follows:
* * * * It is a popular error that
moadow larks do damage to grain, but
this is disproven by the agricultural
department at Washington, which has
shown by the analysis of 278 stomachs
of moadow larks that little or no grain
is over found, and tho little percentage
that is shown was found there at a time
when there was no insect life to feed
upon. They aro strictly insectivorous
birds, and are a positive benefit to
every agricultural community. Of
course this statement will not be ac
cepted by many worthy people who
are honest enough in their opinions,
still have not given the matter sufficient
investigation. They see the bird in
the fields, following tho plough and
going among the grain that is sown,
not realizing that ho is there simply to
pick up the weevil that is found in "the
grain or such insect life that is turned
up in the furrows, and not to feed on
grain. If some of these critics would
take the pains to examine tho stomachs
of the birds just when grain is being
sown, they would very soon see their
orror. If you look at the statutos, Sec
tion 637 A, you will find that tho owner
or tenant of any promises where such
bird is found destroying fruit or crops,
has tho right to kill such birds. This
provision was incorporated simply to
insuro tho passage of the bill, that a
certain amount of protection could bo
given to a bird whose singing is a
Teature of every California landscape,
and whoso mission is simply to do good
and make the country brighter for his
presence. * * * *
[Ranchers, who ought to know, say
differently— that tho birds pull up tho
young grain by the roots— whether in
tho search for iusocts or seeds is im
material, tho destructive work counts
just tho same. — Ed]

Decision of the Court.
On Fobruary 6 Judge Rust rendered
his decision in tho suit of W. Scoblo
against T. J. Seavy and F. A. Orry a
suit brought to quiet the title of plain-"
tiff to tho Champion quartz claim in
Plymouth district. Seavy, as adminis
trator of tho estate of John Ninnis, dis
claimed any interest in the property.
Defendant Orr, however, filed an ans
wer setting forth that plaintiff aban
doned the mine" by failing to perform
labor on the property during the years
1900 and 1901 amounting to $100, as the
law provides. That Orr located the
property Nov. 19, 1901. and had done
the necessary work each year thero
aftor. Tho case was tried before the
court several weeks ago, a number of
witnesses boinar examinod on each side.
Tho case hinged on whother the plain
tiff and his grautors had performed
the annual assessment in the year 1900;
if so the claim was not subject to re
location. Oti this point the decision
says:
The testimony given by plaintiff him
self on this point is in effect that plain
tiff and his son, W. H. Scoblo, during
tho month of November worked .19
days, and during that time cleaned out
the open cut, ran 8 feet of drift, drilled
and blasted, working nine hours a day,
and that tho value of this work [ was
$55. In January 1900 he sunk three or
four cuts and three or four prospect
holes on tho claim for tho purpose of
exposing the lodge, as parties were de
sirous of bonding his claim. In that
year A. J. Estoy and his son, Paul
Estey, worked there from 10 to 11 days
for plaintiff, and plaintiff paid them
$50, making a total of $105, in addition
to work done in January above men
tioned.
In the year 1901 plaintiff bonded tho
property to Dr. Thomas Boyson, who
agreed to do tho assessment work for
that year, and who cleaned out the
shaft, 60 to 75 feet deep, retimborod it
from collar to bottom, and ran a cross
cut at (he bottom 12 feet loug, three to
four feet wide and six foot high, which
work was worth $125. This work was
done in Doc, 1901.
Plaintiff also did work in 1902 drift
ing on tunnel, himself and Rupert
Tim ins doing tho work, plaintiff's work
being valued at $57.50, and that of
Tim ins at $45.
A. J. Estoy and his son Paul both
testified corroborating plaintiff as to
tho work in 1900 and the valuation
thereof, and both testified that instead
of being paid in cash the work went to
pay an undertaking bill due Scoble for
the burial of the mother of the witness,
A. J. Estey, amounting to a balance
of $50. i;r
Defendant Orr endeavored in the
cross-examination of theso witnesses to
contradict them by showing that Estev
and his son only performed $25 worth
of work that year, and that the bal
ance duo for the funeral was $25 and
not $50, as testified to by Scoblo, Estey
and his son, but a severe cross-exami
nation failed to change thoir testimony.
The decision concludes, testing
the ovidenco by those rules: That the
burden of proving a forfeiture rested
upon the defendant who claimed it;
and the further rule that forfeiture
cannot bo established except by clear
and convincing proof of tho failure of
the former owner to have the work
performed and the improvements made
to the amount required by law, it seoms
clear that the defendant has failed to
prove this defense by a preponderance
of the evidence. For the foregoing
reasoning it follows that plaintiff is en
titled to a decree quieting title against
defendants, and that as to defendant
John Ninnis, deceased, this decree shall
bo without costs.
Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh Is indeed a bad sign.
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. For
weak digestion, for defective nourish
ment, for consumption, take Scott's
Emulsion. It restores flesh because .t
strikes to the cause of the loss.

Gourdier— Herbold.
A happy romance culminated in the,
marriage Sunday afternoon at tho resi
dence of the bride, 419 Virginia street,
of Mrs. M. E. Herbold to Mr. Alfred
Gourd ier.
The parlors where tho ceremony
took place were prettily decorated, and

Episcopal phurch made the happy
couple ono. The' bridal party entered
the parlors to the strains of Mendels

Mr. C. M. Arata. Miss Craighead,
sister of the bride, was bridesmaid, and
a brother, Mr. Byron Craighead, of
Placerville, was the groomsman. The
bride was prettily gowned in allover
white lace on movie silk, and carried
a bouquet of white carnations and
maidenhair ferns, and was given away
by Mr. A. T. Brann.

banquet was served to the guests pres

Austin, son aud daughter, and C. M.
Rowley, of San Francisco; Mrs. B.
Morris of Carson, Nevada, and Byron
Craighead of Placerville.
There were many handsome wedding

The happy couple left at 4:20 p. in.
en route to Southern California, with
many congratulatory wishes for a
happy married future.
Considerable amusement was afford
ed at the banquet board when the cut
ting of the large and handsomely deco
rated wedding cake was undertaken at
tho hands of tho bride. Among the
multitudinous ingredients of its make
up several silver trinkets were dis
tributed^-silver rings, thimbles and
brooches. .Perhaps the most signifi
cant of all was a sterling silver heart,
which, reasoned out by those who
know, means that the person receiving
it will bo married next. On the home
cptning pf the newly-married couple
from Santa Cruz on Thursday evening
next, they will hold a receptiqn to their
friends, and especially invited will be
the ladies of loka Council, to which
order the bride has long been a mem
ber, and among whom she is particu
larly popular.— Vallejo Chronicle.
The bride is a daughter of J. W.
Craighead of Jackson, and for several
years lived at Wieland and Jackson in

THE AMADOU LEDGER; JACKSON, CALIFOKHIA, FB ID AY, FEBRUARY 12, 1904.
ALMOST A CENTURY.
J. Van Natter Will Have Beached the
100-Hilestone of Life on the 25th
Instant.
Probably for the first time in the his
tory of Amador county one of her citi
zens is about to pass that age which so
few attain in any land— loo years. On
the 25th instant, if he survives that
date — and the indications now are that
he will and many more — J. Van Natter
will celebrate tho ona hundredth' anni
versary of his birth, and his devoted
daughters in Jackson, Mesdames Blair
and Richtmyer, are looking forward to
the event with keen interest and pleas
ure. Mrs Richtmyer, with whom tho old
gentleman makes his home, has already
planned for the occasion a family din
ner, at which there will be present only
a part of the immediate family, G. M.
Blair, wife and daughter. While Mr.
Van Natter is not a native of the state
of California, he came across the piains
with his family in 1863. Five years
later himself and wife returned east to
Wisconsin, where they resided till 1886,
when his life companion was called
across the river of death, and he re
turned to California, making his home
since with- Mrs. Richtmyer, who has
devoted her life to making his latter
days as pleasant as the ministering of
love and devotion could. To show the
wonderful vitality with which the old
gentleman is still blossed, until just re
cently bo has been at intervals a
familiar figure on our streets, going to
and from tbe barber shop. For the
past few days, however, he has suffered
somewhat with a cold and neuralgia.
He is up, though, and around the
bouse, more cheerful and agreeable
than half the younger generation would
be under similar circumstances. While
from neuralgia tho sight of one eye has
been lost, and his teeth all gone, for
one of his years bis memory is some
thing remarkable. His living children
include Mesdames Richtmyer and Blair
of Jackson, Mrs. H. M. Mannion of
Oakland, and James C. Van Natter of
Wisconsin. He was born in Lawville,
Lewis county, New York, Feb. 25, 1804,
and the Ledger extends to him hearty
congratulations upon the approach of
this wonderful birthday, and wishes
many more may come in his life.
THE LICENSE ORDINANCE.
Editor Amador Ledger:
Dear Sir: — In'your article "Radical
ism in the Saddle," it seems to me that
you do not give the four gentlemen on
the board of supervisors who voted for
the>now saloon ordinance, the credit
for business carefulness which is their
due. Certainly they have been giving
the interest of tbo county their close
attention for some time. They have
also cuiKsultud with pur district attor
ney, and, pur lpcal member pf tho board
tells me, have examined the urdiuauces
from several other counties to see what
provisions are in use there for tho regu
lation and control of the different in
terests considered in this ordinance. If
there is strength in a multitude of
counsel, certainly the board has taken
great care to have this naw county law
strong in all its parts, and they should
not be treated as though their work
and that of the district attorney was
the result of a sudden impulse.
The way to keep our county in the
front rank of counties is to stand by
our lawmakers and county officers in
every effort they make for advance
ment—even if it is not just what we, as"
individual citizens, may think is the
very best. There is a large element of
our pitigens that sop fc'he ey\] ' effects of
the salpbn business sp plainly as to very
much dedire its immediate and com
plete discontinuance. Others think it
a business of very little harm. The
members o f t, no tyjard who supported
this new county law, can not justly be
charged with belonging to either of
these classes. Thoy have done what
they deem to be the best, cpnsidering
all the circumstances, and, though I
am not personally acquainted with any
ono of the four, I feel that they .shqulii
not be charged with ('Radicalism"— at
least not in the sense which tbo general
tone of your criticism Implies.
There are always some to find fault,
whatever is done. And it seems to me
that .the more encouragement the
papers in the county give to those acts
of our supervisors which show so plain
ly an effort to do right, the better for
every interest concerned. Why. my
dear sir, It has already been said in my
hearing, that these men will not stand
by thoir. own ordinance by |he fjpst of
next'Mi^y." What an' insinuation ! Do
you suppose our supervisors are chil
dren? Certainly in tho face of such
suggestions you and I ought to say to
them, "Go* on. gentlemen, and give
your ideas a fair test, and we will sup
port ypu," ■
• Trusting you will give this word in
behalf of those men as fair a space in
your paper as was given their non
endorsement, I am,
Yours respectfully,
W. C. Howard.
lone, Cal., Feb. 9, 1904.
[Tho Ledger is perfectly willing to
allow the abpye ty pass witfaput com
ment. We find np argument therein
that calls for discussion. The amended
ordinance, wo again assert, seems to be
in the interest of publishers, lawyers
and surety companies. . We venture to
say such an enactmont would not com
mand the indorsement of the voters at
the ballpt bps in a B.ipgla township in
Amador county. — Ed.]

A DIVIDEND PAYER
ADDED TO LIST
The Oneida Declares a $40,000 Divi
dend for January — Other Mother
Lode Properties Progressing.
Oneida.— While the Oneida is going
along at the steady gait it has pursued
for the past eight or nine years, pro
ducing something like 7200 tons of ore
per month, it has at last joined tbe list
of dividend payers. At a meeting of
tho directors held in San tYancisco the
26th ultimo, a dividend of $40,000 was
declared payable on tho Ist instant.
Since this is the first dividend paid by
the property since operations were re
sumed in 1895, it speaks well for tho
economic, business-lilc conduct of the
property under its present manage
ment, and the stock holders are to be
congratulated upon the promising out
look for a little interest on their invest
ment. The operations at the mine con
tinue with perpetual motion constancy.
Tho winze being sunk 400 f«et north of
the shaft at tho 2000 level, for pros
pecting purposes, is now down about
lOOfeet, but as .vet nothing startling
has developed. It will.be continued,
however, to the 2200 lovel. As yet tho
new Aldrich pump lias not arrived,
but it is being looked for daily. The
electric cable to furnish the' motive
power for the pump has already been
put in place, and the pump will be in
stalled in short order when it' arrives.
When this pump has been I placed the
Oneida will have become almost a com
plete electric plant.
Keystone,— While this gn?at moth
er lode mine continues its excellent
and steady output., tho management is
overlooking nothing in tho way of im
provements to greater facilitate hand
ling the large product. Since our last
visit at the Keystone two new Grifnn
mills have boon added to the crusher
plant, the I foundations for the new
boilers to be used as air reservoirs are
nearly completod, and tbe pump at the
800 level, to take the water from the
sump pump and raise it to tho surface,
is now in place and performing its work
nicely. In the mine proper now de
velopment continues with satisfactory
results, and although, as a rule, mm
ing -companies who have nothing to
sell do not advertise the values of their
product, we are informed by A 1
authority that the big bodies of -pay
rock in tho Keystone average -a good
deal better than the usual run along
tho lode. The insipid striko which oc
curred there about a month ago, had
no bad effects upqn tho |ab.qr condi
lious at tho wine, aqd np trpubhi of
any character is looked for or feared
there for sumo time to conio.
VVildman-Mahoney. —t While as
yet very little is doing at this property
it is only a matter of a little more time
till Manager Ross will have gotten
matters in shape to again put tho mine
on a basis of steady operation. The
great drawback low is mine timbers.
At this time of year, owing to "bad
roads and the distance timbers have to
be hauled, to socure them is problemat
ical indeed, but notwithstanding those
drawbacks Mr. Ross is not discouraged,
and expects in a week or so to have
men driving towards iho Wildman-
Mahoney lodge from the shaft of the
Lincoln. For tho present qnly tlio
pumps art; gqing, to keep the mine un
w ate red.
Del MONTE.— At the special meet
ing of stockholders of the Del Monte
Mining Company held February 8, the
action pf tho directors in executing' a
trust deed pf the' property to tho
O'Neills to secure tbo payment of in
debtedness tp said Q'Noills in the pur
chase of their interests, iii tho cpmnany
was ratified; Gi-9- !• Wrjght was
elected superintendent and manager of
the mine, and Jas. J. Wright secretary.
The work in the big tunnel has been
resumed, and is riiaking steady and
satisfactory headway, averaging about
two feet por day. A new and more
powerful drill has been secured, and
exerything is progressing favorably.
The tunnel is now in a distance of about
900 feet, leaving 100 feet more to be run
to reach the point where it is expected
to tap the ledge. At the present rate
of progress it is believed thgt {.h/is tun
nel enterprise will bo cqiijpleted by
about the first of April.
South Eureka.— Although noth
ing startling has occurred at this prop
erty since our last visit there, at the
same time there is no jet u[) in tfcpu^uo
tp npw development.' Since' this has
been the making of all the great prop
erties not only on the mother lode but
all ovor the world, tho public nood not
feel surprised to hoar exceedingly good
things of tho South Eureka at any
time in the near future. At present a
drift south from the 2000 level has beon
completed for a distance of 700 feet. In
tho breast of this thero is. now a small
shoeing pf pro, but nqt enough lias boon
donb as jet to determine its oxtent.
The object of this drift is simply to
prospect this virgin ground to the ond
lines of tbo company's ground, and it
will be pushed ahead for at least 800
feet further. At the 2150 level a sta
tion is now being cut tp, d.lift nprth for
a distance of about 000 feet. When
this is completed a winze will bo sunk
to the stopes at the 2300 level for tho
purpose of bettor ventilating tho lower
workings and furnishing hotter facili
ties for handling the timbers in the
stopes at tho 2300 level. As yet nothing
definite has been done relative to tho
now mjlj, but Mr. AJnare expects the
matter, to be taken up some time in
March.
Central Eureka.— At this prop
erty operations continue stoadily both
in mine and mill, there being at pres
ent about 70 men pmpluyed." Just re
cently tho management decided to open
up 100 feet of additional stoping ground,
consequently a contract was let for
sinking the shaft from tho 2100 to 2200
level. This work was begun fin. the
31st of Janviary, and has. progressed at
the rate of 5 foet per day. If' nothing
unforeseen occurs to delay this sinking,
it is expected to reach tho 2100 level by
the 20th instant, and probably by tho
Ist of March tho new stopes will be
furnishing ore for the mill.
Mrs. Dr.' Mushett Dead.
Word has been received by a private
letter from Vallejo, Mrs. Dr. Ida
E. Mushett died in Napa on the 2nd of
February, and was buried at that place
on the 4th instant. She practiced
medicine and surgery for several years
in Amador county, having her resi
dence at Jackson. Some years ago she
removed to Oregon, but after a brief
stay there returned to California, prac
ticing at Jackson, Valloio and Los An
geles. Failing health compelled her to
relinquish in a measure the arduous
work, and she removed with her hus
band and family to Napa county. She
was a victim of consumption, although
wo are Informed that the direct causo
of death was an attack of typhoid
fever. She leaves a husband and two
children, the oldest, Mark Androws,

ANOTHER FATAL ACCIDENT.
William -C. Crocker Falls to His Death
While Being Hoisted in a Skip at
. the Bnnker Hill Mine.
At about 7 o'clock yesterday even
ing, while being hoisted up the shaft at
the Bunker Hill mine, near Amador
City, William C. Crocker, an old-time
miner in this county, in some way lost
his balance and fell to the 'bottom of
the shaft, the distance being sufficient
to kill him instantly. As soou as pos
sible the unfortunate man was taken to
the top, and immediately his family
and the coroner were notified by tele
phone. Just as soon as possible after
the Intelligence was received here, his
son, Charles H., and Coroner Huborty
set out for the mine, where everything
that could had been done in respect for
tho remains. Theycame back to Jack
son early this morning, and Mr. Hub
erty again returned to the miue for tho
purpose of holding an inquest." Mr.
Crocker was born in England 57 years
ago, and has lived in Amador county
for the past 15 or 20 years. He was a
miner by profession, and a good one
too, having worked in almost every
mine in Amador and Calaveras coun
ties. Although ho calls Jackson borne,
he has resided at Amador City for
some time past. He is survived by a
wife, two daughters and four sons. As
yet no arrangements for the funeral
have been made, but it is presumed the
interment will occur in Jackson. The
Crocker family aro among our bost
known and resnected citizens, and their
host of friends in this section will deep
ly sympathize with them in this sad
bereavement.

Wrist Badly Cut.
Little Johnnie Quirolo, living in Clin
ton district, ' in some way fell on a
broken bottle one day this week, and
was so unfortunate as to have the ar
tery in his right wrist cut. Before
medical attendance arrived he had lost
much blood, and although the cut was
sewed up and properly attended, on ac
count of so great a loss of blood he waa
left in an exceedingly weak condition.
In order that he may be more con
veniently located for medical attention,
he was brought to town, and will re
main at the home of Louis Piccardo
until he has recovered.

OUR FIRST REPUBLIC.
It Wai Not the United States, but the
Louisiana Republic.
The first republic in this hemisphere
to succeed in compelling recognition of
Its independence was, of course, the re
public whose proud capital is Washing
ton. But there was an earlier one
which died soon after its birth, of
which little or nothing is said in our
American histories.
When France, in 1764, ceded Louisi
ana to Spain, the subjects of King
Louis XV. objected to the transfer
without their consent. The local gov
ernment submitted the question to the
council, which, under the lead of Nich
olas Chauvin de Lafreniere, rose in re
volt. . Lafreniere called a convention
of the people at New Orleans, while the
new Spanish governor was on his way
to the colony, and the convention se
lected a delegate to go to Paris to dis
suade the French king from his course.
Louis XV., however, rebnffed the dele
gate and sent back word that the peo
ple must recognize the authority of
Spain.
It was then that the people of Louisi
ana resolved on a radical course. On
the night of Oct. 28, 17(58,. the rebels
took possession of the French forts and
the gates of the town in the name of
the republic of Louisiana. The old
French governor offered no resistance,
while the new Spanish governor took
refuge on a ship and sailed for Havana.
On Oct. 2, 1708, the council at New
Orleans adopted a formal declaration
of independence, officially named it
self the republic of Louisiana, elected
Lefrenlere "protector" and prepared a
written constitution. This interesting
government lasted from October, 17G8,
to July, 17C9, when a Spanish squadron
of twenty-four vessels, with an army of
2,000 men, arrived at New Orleans.
The new republican state was destroy
ed and five republican leaders, includ
ing Lafreniere, were put to death.
Then all the republic's official papers,
including its declaration of independ
ence and constitution, were burned iv
the public square.— Springfield Repub
lican.
A BOWERY INCIDENT.
The Invited Client Who Was Called
Before the Feast.
The missionary had finished his talk
to the crowd of derelicts In a Bowery
mission and went around the room to
shake them by the band. There was
one man sitting on a bench whose face
was so utterly loathsome, that the mis
sionary's gorge rose in his throat, and
he was compelled to pass him by. The
man's dulled eye marked the look of
disgust, and in a tone of mingled de
lection and resentment he cried out:
"Say, mister, why don't you shake
hands wid me?"
The young missionary turned, con
science stricken, looked into the sin
ccarred features and grasped the man's
hand.
"Really, brother, you must forgive
me," he stammered. "I — I couldn't help
It when I saw you — your face. But I'll
make amends. You must»tnke dinner
with me tomorrow night."
The broken man glanced at his raga
In confusion, blushed like a girl and
gasped:
"Wot! Mo take dinner wid you! Me
go to your bouse! Me!"
"Yes, I mean it. I'll come tomorrow
night and get you."
True to his word, the missionary pre
sented himself at the lodging house
the next evening and inquired for the
man. A corpse was lying on the table,
a handkerchief spread over its face.
Tlio clerk jerked his thumb in the di
rection of the body.
"That's Wilson," he said. "He had
fixed himself up and was waitln' for
you; dropped dead half an hour ago."—

Embarrassing.
The Squire's Pretty Daughter (exam

dren, can you tell me what a miracle
is?
The children looked at one another,
but remained silent
"Can no one answer this question'?"
the new curate asked, who was stand
ing behind th.c squire's daughter.
A little girl was suddenly struck
with a brilliant idea. She held up her
hand excitedly.
"Well, Nellie?" the squire's daughter
asked, smiling approvingly.
"Please, miss," the small child re
plied breathlessly, "mother says 'twill
be a miracle if you don't marry the

THE DEATH CUP.
This Deadly Fungus Resembles Ser-
eral Kdible Slushroomn.
Perhaps the most deadly of the poi
sonous fungi of our woods and fields
Is the fairly well known death cup
(Amanita phalloides), particularly dan
gerous from its resemblance to several
of the edible mushrooms, though gath
ering fungi for the table should be
undertaken by none save those thor
oughly acquainted with the different
species, as It is altogether too easy for
the ignorant enthusiast to make an er
ror which may prove fatal to his
friends. '
The death cup referred to has n
round cap, white, yellowish or green
ish in color, and the stem has>a swollen
base, surrounded by an envelope, or
veil, of a white filmy substance, which
parts as the stalk extends upward.
This stalk is pithy when young, but
hollow at maturity, and the gills of the
cap, which in the meadow mushrooms
are pink or brown, are white in the
deadly variety, as are also the spores,
which can be plainly seenjlf the cap
is laid, gills downward, onia piece of
colored paper for a few hours. The
swollen, or bulbous, base is a distin
guishing characteristic, und no fungus
of that appearance should be, gathered
for cooking. One of the liabilities is
that these caps may be broken oil
without due observance of its base,
which is often covered with earth or
dead grasses, hence not distinguished
from some of the lepiotas, wfliicb, how
ever, are never surrounded with the
filmy veil of the death cup.
The poisonous property of -this fungus
is largely the same as thatifound in the
venom of a rattlesnake and also in
cholera and diphtheria, and so far sci
ence is unable to produce. any satisfac
tory antidote, atroplne, the stomach
pump and oil purgatives being about
the only resources.— Washington Post
A KOREAN CINDERELLA.
The Quaint Story of Feacb Blosaom,
the Family Drudge.
In Korea the people tell a Cinderella
story that is much more ancient than
that familiar to western people. The
key of the latter story is the slipper,
but not so theirs. Peach Blossom, the
Korean Cinderella's name, was tlw
family drudge. One day as the moth
er was starting off with the favorite
daughter to a picnic she said to Peach
Blossom, "You must not leave until
yon have hulled a bagful of rice and
filled the broken crock with water."
While sitting there bemoaning her hard
lot she heard a twittering and a flut
tering of wings. Looking up, she saw
a flock of sparrows pecking the hulls
off the rice. Before recovering from
her surprise a little imp jumped out
of the fireplace and so skillfully re
paired the crock that but a few. min
utes of work was required to fill it
•With water. Then she went to the pic
nic and had a royal time.
On another occasion the mother said,
"You must stay until you have pulled
up all the weeds in the field." This
time a cow came out of the forest and
ate up the woods in ten mouthfuls.
Peach Blossom followed the cow into
the woods and was k-d to where there
was an abundance of ripe, luscious
fruit. Gathering a large quantity.- she
went to the fete nnd was the most wel
come guest. Her jealous sistor asked
about it and. on being told, determined
she would get some of this fruit for
herself.
When the next gain day came the
sister stayed at homo and let Peach
Blossom go. The i-ow came out of the
woods as before, and the sister follow
ed it through tangled brier anil thorn
bushes, with the result that her face
was much scratched nnd her skin deep
beauty all gone.— Exchange.
A I. my Man.
On a hot summer's day a gentleman
who xenv, waiting for bis train at one
of our country stations asked a porter
who was lying on onp of the scats
where the station master livnCnnd the
porter, not moving, lazily pointed to
the house ivitb his foot.
The gcutloinan. very much struck at

THE DESIRE FOR STORIES.
From the "Once Upon a Time" Stage
to "That Remind* Me."
Our earliest instinct Is to ask for a
Btory, our latest to tell one unasked.
Human life is bounded at either end
by a phrase; "once upon a time" at one
end. "that reminds me" at the other.
Above the first instinct we rise gradu
ally, gradually declining to the second.
Not that the narrative sense ever dies
In us: only that in the plenitude of our
powers we are not satisfied with a story
that is nothing more than a story, a
narrative for narration's sake.
The mind of a child is all agape for
tacts, for it is empty, and nothing is so
Quickly filling, so easily assimilable, as
n dish of facts. Facts of fiction are
preferred by the child to actual fact?
because they satisfy also its strong im
aginative sense. Its moral and intel
lectual senses are still in abeyance. De
duce from auy story "a moral" or an
idea, and the child runs away rudely.
There lies the difference between us
and it. Our , moral and intellectual
senses are flourishing, and by their
strength our imagination is propor
tionately weakened. Grimm is not
enough for us. Our moral sense cries
aloud for Hans Andersen. Dumas
leaves us cold. Our mind needs Balzac.
It is not enough for us that once upon
a time there were thr.ee princesses or
three musketeers who suffered or did
some (iiicer things. We want those
triads to illustrate, to symbolize, to
mean something, to corroborate or up
set some theory that we have formed,
to quicken our mind and affect our
conduct.
Such are the prime needs of our ma
turity. Comes Time, mowing away
with his scythe our intellectual and
moral curiosity; nor does he restore
to us our old imagination. He crops us
bare of all but experience. Things that
have happened— especially, old egoists
that we are, the things that have hap
pened to ourselves— are the only things
that rouse us from our lethargy.
"Anecdotage" is an ugly phrase. "Sec
ond childhood," less harsh, is not less
exactly descriptive. For our last state,
the state ' where narrative is absolute
despot, was our first state too.— Max
Beerbohm in Saturday Review.
WHY HE WASN'T PROMOTED
He watched the clock. ','"=-
He was always grumbling. '■
He was always behindhand. *
He asked too many questions. *;•
His stock excuse was "I forgot."
He wasn't ready for the next step.
He did not put his heart in his work.
He learned nothing from his blunders.
He chose his friends among his infe
riors.
He was content to be a second rate
man.
He ruined his ability by half doing
things.
He never dared to act on his own
judgment.
He did not think it worth while to
learn how. '■;':'■ ' y,'
He thought it was clever to use coarse
and profane language.
He imitated the habits of men who
could stand more thau he could.
He did not learn that, the best part
of his salary was not in his pay envel
ope.—Success. • •■ '.'.- -: , ";
Speed of Blrda.
Frequently arguments arise 83 to the
speed with which wild birds fly, and
many men of science have sought to
determine something about it. Natu
rally it is impossible to fix the record
made by such birds as grouse, quail and
snipe when they first arise, but it is
safe to say that they are not going one
half as fast as the luckless gunner
who misses them imagines. With the
migratory fowls of known fast flight,
such as ducks and geese, something
more nearly accurate is known. The
green winged teal is about the speediest
of them all. It docs something like
ninety miles an hour as readily ns a
sparrow dives Into an inviting rain
spout. The canvasback is only a trifle
slower, probably eighty-five miles* being
Its limit, while the black duck, mallard
nnd redhead fall below this, being
timed at about eighty inijes. Still this
is plenty fast enough to Insure lots of
misses unless the fellow .with the gun
looks down the rib straight nnd pulls
the trigger at the right time.
Elephants and Mice.
An elephant is usually afraid of any
small animal to which it is unaccus
tomed. A dog or cat, and sometimes
even a mouse, will cause him annoy
ance, especially if it runs between the
animal's legs. The noise of a mouse
running through the hay will often
cause an elephant to become excited,
but I have never known or heard of a
mouse getting'on an elephant's trunk.
The terrors of the mouse to a larger
animal is an old story, and many fool
ish superstitions have arisen from it.—
St. Nicholas.

SOLAR MOTION.
Tbe Little We Know About Where
the San Is Golntr.
Can we find out anything about the
motions of our solar system? The old
astronomer, before the invention of
spectroscoplc methods, could attack
the problem only by a consideration of
certain stellar motions. It has been
found that these motions are not alto
gether casual in character, as we
should expect, but there is a tendency
to a grouping of the mottons— an ar
rangement other than • fortuitous. It
appears that the individual stars form
ing the so called constellations on the
sky are slowly closing- up near a cer
tain point of the heavens and as slow
ly opening out near a point diametric
ally opposite. This is just what we
should e"xpect if the solar system is ap
proaching the point where the stars
are opening out. The phenomenon has
been compared to what we see when a
regiment of soldiers marches toward
us. At first there is visible a confused
mass of men only, but as distance di
minishes the ranks open out until each
individual becomes at last plainly visi
ble.
In tliis way it has been possible to de
termine approximately the position on
the sky of the "apex" of solar motion,
or that point toward which our solar
system is at present traveling. It is in
the constellation Hercules. We are
obliged to assume that our path is for
the -moment a straight line. But we
mean that . "moment" -which began
When James Bradley commenced the
first star catalogue of modern precision,
about 1750, and which will end long
after present generations of men have
passed away. So mighty is the orbit
in question that many centuries must
come and go as moments before we can
hope to detect the orbit's curvature.
We are like travelers in the famous
"corkscrew" tunnel of the St. Gothard
railway. Trains enter on a low level
and after going around a huge curve
cut in the mountain emerge from the
tunnel again on a higher level and at a
point almost directly . above the eu
trance. Passengers while in the dark:
tunnel often amuse themselves by
watching the needle of a pocket com
pass, which makes a complete revolu
tion during the passage. But without
the compass they could not know wheth
er the- train was moving on a straight
or curved track, and so we passengers
of the solar system, too, cannot know
by observation whether our great cos
mic track is straight or curved until,
like the compass, the astronomer's in
struments shall tell us the truth.—Har
