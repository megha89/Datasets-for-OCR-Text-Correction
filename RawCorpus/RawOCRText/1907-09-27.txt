The scientific training ot children
adapting education, mental and
physical, to the individual— is a re
form that is becoming more and more
urgently needed. A step in the right
direction has beeu made by Prct.
Alfred Blnet, of the psychological
laboratory at the Sorbonne, Paris.
By a great number of measurements —
including height, weight, width of
shoulders, memory, attention, sug
gestibility, the color sense, head
development, strength of the baud
etc., — some tables have been pre
pared showing the average develop
ment for each age, and children
differing much from the average are
to be specially considered as abnor
mal. The brilliant child is separated
from the dull one, the nervous aud
emotional trom the calm and calcu
lating. A beginning in the forma
tion of classes ot the abnormal cblid
reu has beeu made, and it is hoped
that the work will continue until all
pupils iv the land are classified and
taught according to capacity, and
special requirements.
In tho new Swiss system or electro
culture described by Prof. Barde, two
series of metallic conductors traverse
the plant roots at a depth of two teet
in the soil, each series forming an
olectrode, one of which is connected
to aaixty-fuot lightning rod terminat
ing in copper points, while the other
is attached to a metal plate in the
ground. Tested two seasons on
phylloxera-infested vines, the atmos
pheric electricity destroyed all in
secta, while the vinea showed extra
ordinary growth.
Many wells near tidal waters
fluctuate with the tides. As some
cannot be connected with the aea, it
is now believed that flood tide forcos
up the well water by compression of
the land undor the inoreased weight
of the ocean.
Defining a long fever as one having
a temperature above 99 degrees con
tinuously for at least two weeks, Dr.
K. C. -Cabot finds «nly three long
fevers common in New England— a
region where malaria yields quickly
to quinine and tropical fevers are un
known. The three are typhoid, tuber
culosis and sepsis. At the Mass
achusetts General Hospital, where
the proportion of these three is
lowered by the rule excluding pul
monary tuberculosis except through
mistake, 781 fever cases were investi
gated, and 586 pruved to be typhoid.
54 tuberculosis aud 70 sepsis, making
90 per cent ot the whole, while of the
long fevers not common there were 27
cases of meniugistia, 10 of influenza,
9 of acute rheumatism, 5 of leucemia,
4 of cancer, and 19 of all others.
Painstaking physicians should dis
tinguish between the three commou
fevers, yet mistakes in diagnosis are
made— sometimes with fatal result?.
Typhoid is a general poisoning of the
blood by bacteria, and is liable to be
mistaken tor tuberoulosis when in
testinal symptoms are absent, as is
somntimes the condition. Tuber
culosis may exist without cough,
when the patient may be shut up in a
darkened room as a victim of typhoid
—this being the moist possible treat
ment. Sepsis includes all blood
poisoning by pus, such as abscesses,
wounds, appendicitis and all bidden
ulcerations, and is most difficult to
detect when arising trom abscesses of
the liver, as this organ has no nerves
to signal trouble. To the modem
educated physician there is no such
thing as "simple continued fever," or
"slow fever," or "low fever," or
"bilious fever," or "gastric fever."
The abundance and variety of ants
is a striking feature of the animal
life of the southern slope of the
Himalayas. The snow line rises 6.500
feet higbei than in the Alps, aud Dr.
Forel has recorded four species at a
height ot 12,000' feet, while of 112
species known in these mountains,
not Jess than 50 are local, found only
in the Himalayas.
The novel watch for the blind in
vented by George Mejer, a Germun
watchmaker, is designed to supply a
reliable timepiece at a much more
moderate cost than any yet used by
the sightless. The dial has an ordin
ary minute hand, while the hours are
indicated by twelve buttons in relief,
each button sinking into the dial in
turn with the passage of the hours.
To find the time, the fingers are pass
ed over the dial, when the depressed
button makes known the hour and
the hand gives the minute by its posi
tion. The dial covers a oiroular plate
which takes the plaoe of the ordinary
hour-hand, as its circumference has a
notch into which each button drops
iv turn as the movement of the works
causes the plate to revolve.
The artificial silk wall-paper called
"Metaxin" — a German product— is

How iguoiant we are and how slow
to learn. Man walks on gold mines
for centuries without discovering
them. Take cotton seed for example.
Only a few years ago they were re
garded as a nuisance and of no earth
ly account. Year after year they were
thrown away, vast fortunes being lost
through sheer ignorance. Nowadays
the planter regards his seeds as a big
asset, for they bring him at present
prices not less than $I'J a ton. All
over the Sooth cottou-seed oil mills
have been put up, all of which are
making good money for their owners.
They not only get a valuable oil,
worth fifty-five cents a gallon, but
after its extraction produce a meal
from the kernel that is made into
cakes and expoited to all the markets
ot the world. This meal is one of
the finest and most nutritious articles
used for feeding animals. Even the
bulls of the seed are valued for fat
tening cattle aud bring a good price.
In the same way farmers have found
many uses for parts of the corn pro
duct, once thought to be worse than
worthless. It is tbo ingenious and
inventive few who discover new pro
cesses and virtues and extend the
sphere of agriculture by increasing
its scope and resources. s liut for them
the masses would remain in perpetual
ignorance.

Continuous Daylight in Northland has
Curious Effect on Men and Animals.
Special Correspondence, Seattle:—
As all old prospectors nil] tell, and
it is expected that those most famous
in the history of Alaska and i'ukon
will be present at the Alaska-Yukon-
PaciUc Exposition, which will be
held in Seattle from June Ist to
October 15. 190U, the three months of
almost continuous sunlight each
summer in the Northland has an odd
effect oa most newcomers.
As a matter of fact a man accus
tomed to seveu hours' sleep eaon
night, finds upon going to Alaska
that he cannot easily adjust himself
to the altered conditions. Most
people get sleepy when the dark
comes, and do not think ot sleeping
in daylight. As a result men go
from day after day wheu Urst in the
north with little inclination tc
sleep. A man has to train himself
in Alaska and Yukon to go to bed
with the sun shining high in the sky.
Ibose who need darkness in order to
slumber comfortably have to pin
blankets over the windows aud go to
a great deal of extra trouble to pro
duce il. It is said In the early days
that the chickens that were first
brought to the north in the summer
time went crazy for want of rest.
They waited and waited for the sun
to set in order to know when to go
to roost, and as it continued gt.o
shine, the fowls went without sleep
until they were exhausted. This
story is hardly verified but it is true
tbat the continuous daylight has a
very odd effect on men and animals
alike and it takes a tew weeks to get
accustomed to it.

Meaning of the Mother Lode.
A correspondent asked the editor
of the American Mining Keview lor
some information regarding the
mother lode, its significance of value
and whether or not the best mines
are always on the Mother Lode. Be
received the following interesting
reply:
The term Mother Lode originated
in California with the pioneer miners
of the early clays. It was a name
given to a succession of large out
crops of white quartz which were
found occurring at intervals under
varying geological conditions for
about 120 miles through the counties
of Mariposa, Tuolumne, Calaveras,
Amador and El Doiado; many of
these outcrops were found to be gold
bearing, but some of the most im
portant and richest mines of this
great mineral belt were not character
ized by huge outcrops.
The Keystone mine at Amador City,
which has produced over $16,000,000,
has only a small outcrop, and the
Eureka mine at gutter Creek, with a
record of 818,000,000, merely showed
a small outcrop of quartz— not more
than four or rive feet wide. The
Empire and Pacific at Plymouth,
which produced about 10,000,000, aud
were at one period the most pro
duotive mines iv the state, are ob
scure at the surface.
The Kennedy and Argonaut at Jack
son, which have turned out nearly
§10,000,000 in gold, have a compaia
tively small outcrop, eight or ten
feet wiae. The Utica at Angela Camr
was not characterized by bold out
croppings, nor was the Princeton in
Mariposa county. On the other
band, there ore a score or more of
mines on the Mother Lode having
huge outcrops, 100 to 300 feet wide
and standing prominently above the
surface, that have been extensively
developed, which have never proved
profitable.
The name, however, has tiecome
famous and in almost every miuing
region of tbft world the miners usual
ly fix upon some lode or vein which
they call the "mother lode." The
idea seems to be that this main lode
is the parent vein of the regiou and
that it is in some manner responsible
for the other veins ot the vicinity.
It merely represents the miners
fancy, and from any standpoint the
"mother lode" is withont particular
significance, for as in California,
good mines are found in isolated
position and in no mauner connected
or identified with the principal
mineral lode or belt of the country.

James Drew, carman at the Fiemont

a car Thursday, severely jammed the
knuokle of tho right forefinger. Al
though the abrasion was slight the
wound was so painful that Dr. Lynch

that the bone had been chipped so he

It ia almost a certainty that the
550,000 bond issue rncently voted by
the Bouora school district for the
erection of new school buildings will
come to no avail, and the entire
matter, election aud all, will have to
be gone over gagain. The trouble
arises from tho fact that the capital
ists who were to purchase the bonds
have discovered a technical flaw in
the proceedings concerning the estab
lishment of the boundaries ot the
Bchoul district. I'ney asked for an
abstract of the district boundaries
which could not be furnished. Tho
district was organized in the early
'50's and has been in existence with
its present limits ever since, but the
boundaries were never officially estab
lished by tho supervisors as provided
by law.— lndependent.
We learn from the Sierra Times
that a sixteen foot vein of rich ore
haa been uncovered on the 2600-foot
level of tho Qwln mine. The strike
only goes to prove that there would
he a number of such mines as the
Uwin along the Mother Lode if
capital enough were only invested to
gain the depth at which the Uwin is
vow being worked. Urass-root com
panies have beeu the curse of the
county for years past, and will con
tinue to be as long as that sort of
mining exists.

William Sozzie, who resides at the
Big Bar bridge, caught a striped bass
in the ricer at that place one day last

year 1879, one hundred and thirty-five
striped bas9 one aud a half to three
inches iv length trom the JNaversiuk
river, Now Jorsey, aud in ISH'i three
hundred more email fish were planted.
As for tho commercial vnlue ot the
enterprise, tho returns have been vory
great. l J rofessor Hugh M. Smith,
deputy United States commissioner
of fisheries, estimates that the annual
catch ot striped ba-s iv recent years
is 1,750,000 pounds; the annual value
to fisherman, 3105,000; the aggregate
catch about 17,000,000, including the
current year, and the total value of
the catch approximately 5920.0U0.
Ihey have beeu catching striped bass

Scarcity of School Teachers.
Reports from school trustees and
superintendents in all parts of Cali
fornia indicate a serious shortage in
school teachers, although salaries are
good and living conditions attractive.
Ihe five normal schools of the state
have placed all their graduates and
are entirely unable to meet the de
mand. This shortage in the teaching
foroe of the state, outside the cities
and towns, has been growing for the
past three or four years.
Not only are teaohers scarce for the
country sohools. but the figures, as
noted by the Calitornma promotion
committee, would seem to show au
impending shoitage in the supply of
oity pedagogues as well. In years
heretofore the number of applicants
for the civil service examination lor
teaobers in San Francisco, has run
trom two nnudred and fifty to thieo
hundred. This summer, however,
there were only about ninety in spite
of the fact that no examinations were
held a year ago. which circumstance
naturally should have increased the
number of applicants -this year.
Teachers' salaries have been very
largely increased throughout the
state, but this fact
the number of teachers deems to be
dwindling. The minimum salaries
in San Francisco, Oakland, Stockton
and Los Angeles have been increased
in sums ranging from five to fifteen
dollars "a month. In the rural schools
a very general advance has been made
from salaries of sixty to seventy
dollars a month to from seventy to
eighty-five.

HUNTING MISSING LINK.
Dr. Max Moskowski, a German
scientist, has arrived at Java in
cbnrgn of an expedition sent out to
find the "missing link between man
and ape. Ihe expedition is being
financed jointly by the Kojal Prus
sian Academy of Science and the
Dutch Government, and Dr. Mos
kowski, who is a zoologist. He is
accompanied by geologists, engineers
and an escort of troops provided by
the 'Dutch authorities. Java waa
chosen as the destination of this expe
dition because a Dutch scientist,
Prof. Dubois, said he found the
"missing link" there some twenty
years ago. In the course of bis
excavations in Java Dubois unearthed
the remaius of a savage being which
could have been neither man nor ape
but somotbiug between the two.
These remains showed a sti iking re
semblauce to those of primitive man
belonging ro the Neaderthal race
found iv Wnrtemburg. Dr. Moa
kowski will begin his excavations in
the valley of the Solo Kiver, near the
voloauo Lavu, and will carry on the
wurk for at least a year in the hope
of finding the lost link.

C CITY OFFICIAL PAPER.
F FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 27. 1907
Running a Bluff.
Tbe Ledger of last week made the
following statement:
"The Dispatch last mouth pat in a
bill for envelopes in this wise:
500 6)^ envelopes - - 52.50
express - ... 1.00
Then the editor of the Ledger pro
ceeds witb a lot of bogwasb comment
that is neither relevant nor to tbe
point, aimed at the supervisors iv
general and The Dispatch in parti
cular. The Dispatch cares nothing
for, the hogwasb and does not deem
it worthy nf an answer. The only
reason we notice tun article at all
is to refute tbe statement, aud to
"expose" another of Webb's lies.
The statement that The Dispatch put
in a bill for "expiess 81.09" is ab
solutely false and without foundation,
and we hereby oballeuge Mr. Webb to
produce any proof for bis assertion.
On the other band Tbe Dispatch can
produce most substantial evidence
that .Webb's statement is untrue,
that evidence is nothing more noi
lees than tbe bill itself, which is en
tile with county treasurer (irittou.
and we defy Kicbard Webb or any of
bis jampered satellites to tlnd any
item on tbat bill wbicb reads "ex
press, 81. 00," and to wbicb alleged
item tbe hogwash comment referred.
This is not the first time tbe Ledger
. has misrepresented tacts in order to
find an excuse to throw ' a few
bouquets. For the past thirty-two
years be has been "In tbe same old
business. " — Dispatch.
When the Ledger undertakes to ex
pose official shortcomings, or graft iv
public matters, tbe editor is generally
pretty certain of his ground. We do
not go into it blindly, but invariably
take our stand on the reoords. The
case above cited was no exception to
tbe rule. We took our item from
"tbe bill itself, which is on Hie" io
the treasurer's office. We may possi
bly be mistaken once in a while.
But in faou of tbe "bluff" article
detying us to produce proof of onr
assertion, we this week looked up tbe
bill again, intending, if we found we
had madveitently fallen into an
error, to mace the correction, and
take back tbe charge. Atfer examin
ing tbe bill, however, we must stay
with our original statement, as being
tbe only intelligible reading of tbe
item. Tbe line reads thus:
July 28-500 envelopes No 6^ 52.50
express 81 83.50
Tbe word wbicb we construe as
"express" is indistinctly written; it
might be intended for "expense" or
expenses. The xis written as a "p"
but tbat would be meaningless. We
asked another to Interpret, and he
was unable to tell what it stood for.
And we defy those who allowed it to
make out anything else than express
or expense. And in either case tbe
outcome is the same. It is an extra
charge, written as such, in connection
witb the furnishing of 500 envelopes,
and therefore falls within tbe scope
of a grafting business. Tbe schedule
price is $2.50 for 500 envelopes. That
is all we have charged, all we have
been allowed, and why the super
visors should peimit tbe Dispatch to
charge 40 per cent more and do it
month after month, is beyond our
comprehension. An established rate
is supposed to apply to all who furn
ish supplies to tbe county officers.
It behoves tbe supervisors to see tbat
no overcharge is made. That is what
tbey were elected for. But this
setting aside of the schedule adopted
10 years ago, and refusal to adopt
another, if it has become obsolete,
thereby allowing one shop to ring in
extra, while another adheres strictly
to the old-time worn-out schedule, is
a shame and a disgrace. Tbe Ledger
does not propose to intentionally
misrepresent anything. It has given
the facts as far as we could gather
them from the bill. The Dispatch
failed to inform its readers what this
extra 81 for 500 envelopes was for,
and we now call upon our ootempor
ary to enlighten tbe public on tbat
score. Let us know what he meant
by the word we have interpreted
as "express" and cannot upon re
examination interpret in any other
way.
In the bill of our cotemporßry
allowed by the supervisors at their
meeting last week, the same gouging
tactics are pursued. The wording It
changed but tbe result reached is pre
cisely tbe same. In this bill we find
two items reading as- follows:
500 6% envelopes 82.50, stock 81 13. 8U
Ihe word "stock" is substituted
for "express' or "expenses," but tbe
graft ot 40 per cent on the shedule
price is retained in each item. It
would certainly be a wonderful ac
complishment for a printer to furnish
envelopes or any other printed matter
without stock. The order for print
ing necessarily includes tbe stock
If a merchant orders 500 envelopes,
and was charged $2.50 for printing
and 81 for stock, be would be apt to
open his eyes in wonderment at such
an unprecedented proceeding. But
witb the county managers, this thing
is played month after month by the
Dispatch, and still there is nothing
doiug to correct tbe evil. At the
same time the Ledger puts in its
price'according to schedule, aud with
the discrepancy staring tbe super
visors in tbe face, the unjust and
absurd discrimination continues as if
it were a thing of righteousness upon
tbe taxpayers.

A Tax Question.
Our cotemporary is evidentally
laboring under a delusion when it
states that tbe tax levy of S2 dollars
on tbe 3100 is a reduction of ten cents
on the rate last year. The state and
county rate is just tbe same. Our
neighbor has probably been misled
by tbe 10 cent levy in Jackson school
district for tbe bond redemption fund
last year. This liability was then
wiped out, so it does not figure in
this year's tax. levy. To tbe property
holders of Jackson school district the
tax rate is ten cents less, but for
general purposes the tax rate is the
same with a material increase in tbe
assessment roil, meaning a serious
increase in tbe amount demanded for
the support of the government.
Another statement open to objec
tion Is tbat within tbe incorporated
limits of Jaukdon tbe late will be
{1.67. This assertion exempts tbe
city dwellers from the 33 cents ioad
tax, but assumes tbat tbey are liable
witb the outsiders for tbe I'J' 2 cents
levied for bridge fund. The reason
tbat would exempt us from the road
tax applies witb equal force to the
bridge tax. The city has its own
streets to take care of. It takes tbat
burden from the county road fund.
It also has to take care of tbe bridges
within its boundaries. Wby, then
should city property holders be called
upou to share the expense ot outside
bridges. Jackson cannot call upou
the county for help in maintaining
roads or bridges.
If Jacksonites are to be mulcted in
IS), 1 « cents for bridges in addition to
tbe city and oounty taxes, the
total taxation within the city
will amount to tbe formidable
figures ot J2.37; or 37 cents for tbe
doubtful benefits of incoiporation.
But we are conQdont that tbe bridge
tax must also be exoluded as well ac
tbe road tax, wbicb will make tbe
total taxes 11 l .j cents more inside
thau outside tbe city.
The levy of a special tax for bridge
fund is something unusual. We do
not know of another instance in
which this has been done iv Amador
county for many years. We do not
find that it has been done in other
counties, so far as our exchanges
show. We do not know under what
particular law this has beeu done.
Bridges are part of the higbway. Tbe
tax for road purposes inoludes the
maintenance of bridges. The super
visors bave usually set apart a por
tion of the general ruad fuud for a
bridge fund. But this year they have
adopted tbe novel system of levying a
special tax for bridges, as it is esti
mated tbat 315,000 will be required
tor these structures this year.
A serious question arises here. Tbe
maximum tax for ioad fund is 40
cents. In addition tbey may levy a
special tax not to exceed 20 cents for
main roads. Mow I.' 1 ., cents added to
33 cents for regular ioaa fund makes
52>n— whioh is 12>£ cents beyond the
limit.
Tbe strike of tbe street carmen in
San Francisco has developed a unique
situation. For months tbe strikers
endeavored by every method known
to them to reduce the patronage of
tbe cars. Tbe; '.run buses to take
away business, they bad pickets out
to intimidate persons from riding on
tbe cars, and winked at or incited
acts of violence to non-union carmen
and patrons. Now things are entire
ly different. Tber want to force a
settlement of tbe strike in their favor
by loading the cars to their limit, in
tbe hope tbat tbe United Kailioadt
will be compelled to take back the
old experienced hands, who alone
tbey imagine can handle tbe business
successfully. The spectacle of a body
of striking workmen trying to get
reinstated by overloading their ex
employers witb business is certainly
novel.
While the press is recognized as the
most potent of all agencies is preserv
ing the rights ot tbe people iv a re
publican form of government, it is a
startling faot tbat during tbe last six
or seven years the newspaper death*
have exceeded the births by 2629.
That is, there are that mauy less peri
odicals or journals published now than
there were in 1901. This newspaper
mortality is attributed largely >o
the denial by the post oUiee depart
ment ot tbe stuond-class rate to pub
lishers who iv tbe opinion of tbe
authorities violate tbe postal luws and
thereby render themselves ineligible
to secoud-class rates. The second
class rate is one cent per pound. The
next or third class rate is ten cents pei
pound. The difference is so great tbat
to change a publication from second
to third class list means practically
the destruction of tbe business. The
extra cost in postage is sufficient to
change a profitable journal to a losing
venture, and to save himself the
publisher is compelled to quit. On
the other band, the postal department
has been grossly imposed upon by
some publishers in tbe matter ot sec
ond class privileges, entailing enor

lisher is foiced to go to court to se

of last week, and is running smoothly
under tile guidance of Miss ldele
Wbitehead of Ambdor City.
The giape harvest is on in earnest,
and the growers are rushing matters
with due regard to the threat of early

T. D. Davis is in Plymouth, bis

J. L. Davis of Madera, was v visitor
at bis old home for a few days last
week, leaving Friday for Sacramento,
where he spent a short time witb his
mother aud brother tiobert Davis,
who has been in the Sister's hospital
for about live weeks. He is so far im
proved that he has been given the
promise of an early return to his
home.
The team attached to Burko's meat
market wagon ran away while on
their regular trip through the valley
Monday of last week. They over
turned tbe wagon early iv the race
and broke loose, continuing their
homeward way free of all responsibil
ity. They were stopped after about a
mile and a half, without injury to
themselves. J'he canvas cover to the
wagon was a wreck, aud the driver,
Trevor Weston of Plymouth, colleot
eii a few bruises when tbe spill came,
but no other damag9 was done.
While on bis visit to the homo
folks, James Davis of Madera, drove
to Plymouth one evening to spend a
few hours with his brother, T. D,
Davis. During the evening the horse
managed tv loosen the rope with
which he was tied, and wended his
way placidly homeward, leaving his
erstwhile driver to make the beet of
tbe matter of a four mile walk.
When tbe brothers separated for the
night, the trail of the dragging rope
told its own story, so Mr Davis was 1
able to start home with no anxiety
nbout a stolen rig. J'he ung^ided
borae made the trip without accident I
until be came to the sharp turn where
the road to the Davis ranch leaves
the mtiin road, at this point the
buggy ran against the fence, and
tipped over, breaking oue shaft.
When Mr Davis arrived on the scene
hia horse had dragged the overturned
buggy about twenty yards and was
still patieutly tugging at the un
wieldy burden. The damage except
perhaps to the driver's feelings was
merely normal. Shan.
It is repotted from the hop fields
along the Consumues river that the
crop this year is much larger than
usual, but owing to tbe exceedingly
low price ot six cents a pound the
returns will not be so gieat as in

Plymouth people and some from
Ainador aud this place are helping
to harvest the crop.

The lumber in the platform erected
for the Native Sons celebration on
admission day waa sold to David
Mattley, who put a force of men to
work the end of last week in tearing
it down. It was all taken down by
Monday night. There was about 15,
000 feet in the structure. The floor
ing would cost between 810 and SaO,
and- the rough lumber over 830. At
this rate the material would cost be
tween 8300 and SGOO. The cost of
erecting it would probably add
another §100. The cost of the otber
platform would no doubt amout to
8100. The old lumber would not sell

Mr and Mrs B. K. Taylor returned
from their trip to Honolulu on Fri
day. They spent over a week in the
islands. The vessel they went over
on was quarantined on its arrival, ou
account of the existence of a case of
bubonic plague on board. The victim
was a fireman on the steamer, and
the disease had developed on the voy
age. He recovered. The first-class
passengers were held only four hours
by the quarantine, but the vessel and
other passengers were detained for a
longer period. The heat of these
island possessions is something terri
ble to one accustomed to the genial
air of California. The most striking
featuie of the population was the vast
preponderance of the Oriental ele
ment. Of a total population of 200,
000 over Bu,ooo are Japanese, and
30,000 Chinese. Native Americans
number about 15,000.
The Hre that broke out in the Kelly

the land of E. S. Pitois, burning
about 110 out of the 1(50 acres, de
stroying the timber. Tbe adjoining

FATAL ACCIDENT
AT THE ARGONAUT.
Cable Bieaks and George Troyan
Falls to His Death
A lamentable accident, causing tbe
instant death ot George Troyan, one
of the shift bosses, occurred at the
Argonaut mine on Sunday afternoon.
It illustrates that notwithstanding
the utmost precautions, accidents are
liable to occur in a manner least ex
pected. George Troyan, tha foreman
of the day shift, was at toe lowest
level in tbe mine, 2000 feet, at about
two o'clock in the afternoon. There
is a donkey engine in tbe shaft at the
2100 loot level, which is used in
hoisting or lowering below that level.
Tbe cable is wire, live-eights of an
inch thick.
It had baen in use bat seven
mouths, and the life of a cable of
that size is from two to three years.
No one had ever complained about
its beiug unsale, and .^the men rode
up and down oil it without the least
apprehension of danger. it was ex
amined regularly, and every pre
caution was taken to keep it in good
working shape. it was the business
of Troyan as much as anybody's to
acquaint himself with tbe condition
of the cable, as he had charge of tbe
cable and everything in the mine. If
any employe had ccnsidered tbe cable
unsafe it was his duty to report to
either tbe superintendent or one of
tbe shift bosses. Tbera were otber
ways of ascendiug and descending
between the 2100 and lower levels
besides tbe skip. There was tbe
ladders, and also tbe stopea. The
t'aot that tbe skip was preferred by
tbe men shows conclusively that the
employes considered everything about
the cable in first-class order, and per
fectly safe. After the accident re
ports were curient on the street that
the cable had been condemned as un
safe; that the company bad neglected
to change it after being requested so
to do. Aooording to the sworn teati
mony at tbe inquest, there was not
tbe shadow of truth in these repoita.
The accident, so far as known,
happened iv this way, Chas. V.
Kohler the engineer on duty at the
2100 level at tbe time, says the skip
bad been traveling up and down all
the afternoon. He got tbe sigual
from the 2(300 to hoist. He knew
from the method of ringing who wus
signaling, that it was George Troyan.
Some one stopped at the 2500 level,
and he then got 3-2 bells to lower to
the 2(500 level. He stopped there four
minutes, and then got 3-1 bells,
which meant "hoist— man on." Knew
it was Troyan that was giving the
signal. He put on the air, and
immediately felt a jerk, and at the
fame time the bell rang again. He
knew that something had gone wrong,
and expressed his foars to A. Davalle,
who was standing by him. The cable
bad parted, and someone was aboard
at the time. They hastily descended
the ladder to the 2000 level, and
found no one there. Went below into
the sump, and foind Troyaii's cap
resting on the timbers two sets below
the station. The only inference was
that the victim with tbe skip had
gone into the sump, containing fifteen
feet of water. Grappling iruns were
sent down as soon as possible, and at
the first effort the body ot tbe un
fortunate victim was brought to the
surface, and taken to the top of tbe
shaft.
An examination revealed no dis
liguring marks upon the body, except
a superficial abrasion of the skin over
tbe forehead, believed to have been
caused by the rope. It was not
sulHicent to cnuse unconsciousness.
The opinion is that be was drowned
•in the waters of the sump. The cable
parted about 70 feet above the skip.
It did not break wbile being hoisted,
bat before it started upward. As
soon as the cable tightened tbe jerk
indicated that it had snapped. De
ceased with the skip fell 70 feet on
the incline. It is supposed that tbe
skip never left the track.
The body was removed to the home
at Newmanville. Coroner Potter was
notified and beld an inquest tbe
following afternoon, before the fol
lowing named jurors. A. Uinocchio,
Geo. Mann, L. J. Glavinovich, W. X
Spear, L. .Prout, H. G. Garbarlni, M.
Marelia, Wm. Penry jr., C. ii.
Arditto, and Oscar O. Myers. The
witnesses examined were W. J. Nettle,
superintendent, A. Davalle, miner,
C. Hess, timberman, (J. X Kobler,
engineer and Eugene Uonti, shift
boss. The testimony developed tbe
facts as above stated. It was shown
that four men had ridden on that
skip at one time on the morning of
the acoident; that U. Boas had ridden
on it only ten minutes before the
accident; that no one apprehended
tbe least danger; that the cable was
500 feet in length, only one half ot
which was used, that by changing tho
cable which the deceased had spoken
of shortly before his death he meant—
not putting on a new cable, but
simply changing ends of the one then
in use, as the end wound round the
reel had never been used, and was as
good as new. There wa3 no need of
Ihe men going on this skip, as the
main skip in the other compartment
was available, but they seemed to use
the smaller one as more convenient.
Deceased remarked to the engineer
on the morning of tbe accident that
he intended to change the cable short
ly, but that it would answer for a
while yet. He did not mean that it
was worn to any dangerous extent.
The jury returned a verdict that
deceased came to his death by the
accidental breaking of tbe cable, and
that no blame could be ttttacbed to
the company for tbe fatality.
It was one of those unfortunate
attairs that no human foresight could
guard agaiost. Everything had been
done by the engineer to keep tbe
cable properly greased, which was
essential to its preservation. The
wet, damp conditions existing at that
depth in the shaft made it more
difficult to keep the cable protected,
but everything was done to that end.
The lamentable accident spread a
feeilug ot depression mid gloom over,
all tho employes. The victim had
been a trusted employe of the com
pany for many years. He leaves a
wife and five children— four girls
and one son. Tbe oldest— a daugh
ter—is iibout nineteen years of ago,
and tbe youngest seven.
Deceased has been connected with
the Argonaut ever since it was started
by tbe present company, holding a
position of responsibility all the
time. He was liked by all tbe em
ployes, on acoount of bis affable ways
aud consideration for tbe workmen.
Tbe funeral took place Wednesday
morning at ten o'clock. All the em
ployes of the mine were laid off on
that day to attend the last sad rites,
out of respect to the momory of tbe
dead. The floral pieces were beauti
ful and many. Tbe National Crotian
Society, of which the deceased was a
member, took charge of Ihe funeral
arrangements. Services were held in
St. Patricks churoh, conducted by
Rev. Father Gleeson, and tbe inter
ment was in the Catholic cemetery.
Tbe Austrian society attended in a
body, in regalia, also tbe miners, and
a large procession of private citizens
followed the remains to tbe grave.
He leaves bia family well-provided
for financially. His life was insured
in the New England company for
82000. From the Austrian society
tbey will receive benefits to the
amount of about 8800. During tbe
many years of his employment, he
bad accumulated a fair competence.

Preliminary Examination.
Ihe preliminary examination ot
Mrs Marie Clarich, charged with the
murder of M. Yojetich in Amadcr
City, was held before justice W. L.
Rose in Sutler Creek yesterday morn
ing. The accused, who has been in
tbe hospital for tbe past week, was
taken over to our sister town by
Sheriff Gregory. Tte district attor
ney went over to represent the prose
cutor, and A. Caminetti and R. O.
Bole, appeared for tbe defendant.
W. H. Willis stenographer, came up
from San Francisco, to take down
tbe testimony. The facts of this
case were given in tbo Ledger some
weeks ago. Tbe deceased took the
defendant from her husband and her
borne in Los Angeles, eloping, to
Oakland, where tbey lived together
for ten months. Shortly before tie
homicide, and wbile the woman was
in a delicate condition, Yojetich de
serted her, and came to Amador, find
ing work at the Keystone mine. Tbe
defendant bearing of his whereabouts
followed him, aud demanded that be
at least help her in hei trouble. He
refused to do so, and she entered his
room in the Imperial hotel at 6
o'clock in the morning and shot him
dead wbile asleep, tiring three shots
in rapid succession. Public sym
pathy was, and still is, strongly with
the woman.
After hearing the testimony the jus
tice ordeied the defendant discharged,
on the ground of the improbability of
ooiiviction under the circumstances.

Kennedy.— Just encountered the
ore body in the south dntf at the
3000 toot level. The ledge is 3 feet
thick, with the fissure between the
walls nine feet wide. It is high
grade lock, and will no doubt in
crease in size, as it penetiates
further, as this has been the case in
the levels above. This ore bodj
south of the shaft is tho most re
markable iv size ar;d character mot
with in the history ot this famous
mine. It is oontinous from the 2100
to 3000 level, in places being 1000
fset long, and while of good uilliug
character throughout it has at times
developed into bonanza values. In
some places it is over 30 teet in
width. The ore in sight ensures the
profitable working ot this mine for
many years. Preparations are beiug
made to sink the shaft at least 15U
feet deeper. The sump is being
cleaned out, and sinkiug will com
mence as soon as this is completed,
it will take about three mouths to
sink 150 feet. :
THE McCUTCHEN BANKRUPTCY.
Tbe sale of tbe bankrupt stock ot
J. McCutcben will take place in
Sacramento to-morrow, before tbe
referee. Sealed bids will be opened
at twelve o'clock, and the matter of
confirmation will come up immediate
ly thereafter. Ihe examination of
tbo bankrupt will also take place to
morrow.
Three appraisers, A. Ginnoocbio, S.
Myers and L. J. Glavinovich, were
appointed by U. S. Gregory, trustee,
to re-apDraise tbe stock belongiug to
the McCutchen bankruptcy estate.
They went over the stock Wednesday
and estimated it at 75 per cent of tbe
first appraisement. The furniture
and fixtures were valued at 50 per
cent of the former valuation. Tbe
Rosenburg stock was estimated at 50
cents on tbe dollar. A gentleman
from San Francisco was here Wednes
day, in the interest of parties in San
b'rancisco, who are expecting to bid
on tbe stook, and for the purpose of
looking over tbe goods for his owo
satisfaction. He left again yesterday
morning.
Wine Making.
All tbe large users ot claret wine
have commenced making sufficient to
last them until next season. By far
the largest part of tbe wine will be
made, of grapes from around Loili,
though all the grapes raised in this
vicinity have been disposed of. The
grapes here make bettor wine by far
thau those of tbo valley, having fully
five per cent more sugar. The price
paid in Lodi is about ?1(> a ton, wbile
tbe same grape here costs about 522,
besides which the freight from Lodi
i~. abuut SI making tbe price laid
down here $'20, or a little more a ton.
Perovich expects to store about 1500
trillions, Marcucci at the Broadway
hotel about 2500, Millovich about
2000, Giovannoni & Co., about 1500,
Ualporta at tbo California hotel
about 1700, besides which are numer
ous others who will make smaller
quantities.
Pioneer flour is the best; have no
other.
A Warm Reception.
& Gutridge, a former employe of
tbe Zeila mine, luft here a few weaks
back for recuperation, intending to
go to Ramsey upon tbe restablishxent
of his health to work at the Ramsey
(Jomatock mine, of which \V. Waller,
also from Jackson, is superintendent.
Uutteridge appears to have been
warmly greeted, in an unlooked-for
manner, as appears from the follow
ing clipping taken from the Ramsey
Reoorder of September 22d :
Ramsey's Urst fire, accompanied by
d seriou3 accident, oocurod Thursday
about noon hour when a tent frame
was utterly destroyed, the fire having
been caused by the explosion of a
gasoline stove. The place was oc
cupied by Frank Fuller, a brother cf
District Recorder Wm. Fuller, who
was preparing his noon meal. E.
Gutteridge, who arrived from Cali
fornia the duy previous, was also in
tbe tent bouse and was lying down
on a bunk in tha rear end of tbe
building when the gasoline stove
blew up.
Mr Fuller, who was standing close
to the stove received tbe full force of
tbe explosion and was enveloped in
flames. Mr Gutteridge tan toward
tbe door, as the whole place was filled
with flames find smoke, and his cloth
ing caugfct Hre. He lay down in the
ilust outside and rolled around until
his burning clothes were smothered
of Ore. He was not injured. Mr
fuller bad the pieseGce of mind to
grab a quilt from tbe bunk and when
he emerged from the burning tent
Gntteridge called to him to lay down
at tbe same time assisting to put out
his blazing clothing. Fuller was very
badly burned about the face and
bands. All tbe attention possible
was given him by numerous neighbors
aud friends, and be was a little later
taken over to Reno for medical
attendance. His injuries while ex
treroely painful are not regarded as
daugerous.
bortunately the place occupied as
bachelor quarters stood apart from
any other buildings and there was no
danger of tho fire spreading. The
iite again calls attention to tbe danger
of using a gasoline stove, and It
would seem a good form of insur
ance — both life and tire— to prohibit
the use altogether.
Deer Plentiful.
Deer have been more numerous in
the section below Jaokson than bas
been known for a long time. Four
have been killed within a few mllea
of this city during tbe past week. A.
J. Lavetone captured one, also Elmer
Dufrene aud one of tbe Horton boys.
N. Cardinelli managed to bring

Bascom and His Students.
Johu Bascom, once president of the
University of Wisconsin, always haci
a keen insight into men, and for much
of his life college students constituted
mankind for him. Once when he was
a clans officer the names of two men
were read by him as absent from
morning prayers. One of them, a pie
tist, stopped at his desk and said:
"Professor, when the chapel bell was
ringing I was engaged in prayer and
did not hear it."
"Yon're not excused," responded
John, with contempt in his eye and

Then, calling back the other man,
who was about at the door on his way
out of the room, he said to him:
"What's your excuse?"
"I haven't any, sir."
"You're excused.'
He used to have debates in his class
room. At one of them a student, whom
Bascom subsequently described as a
"floriating fellow," in the heat of his
eloquence said, "I wish that I had
the ability and the time to exhaust
this subject"
"You have the time," said Bascom.—

The boy replied, "Thirty-two."
The visitor drew the number back

"Is that right?" asked the visitor.
"Yes, sir; yes, sir," answered the boy
in a timid way.
"What number shall I take now?" he
asked of another.
The boy answered, "Sixty-two,"
whereupon the visitor drew the num

"Is that right?" he asked.
"Yes, sir," replied the boy.
A long way back a bright eyed boy
held up a wavering hand.

Reade's Eccentric English.
Reade's use of the English language,
too, was eccentric, not to say ludicrous.
In "A Simpleton," when he wished to
Signify that two people turned their
backs on each other in a fit of temper,
he wrote, "They showed napes." De
scribing the complexion of the New
Haven fishwives in "Christie John
stone," he says, "It is a race of wo
men that the northern sun peacblfies
instead of rosewoodizing.'" In "Readl
ana v> he describes a gentleman giving
a lunch to two ladies at a railway res
taurant as follows: "He souped them,
he tough chickened them, he brandied
and cochlnealed one, and he brandied
and burnt sugared the other (brandy
and cochineal and brandy and burnt
sugar being Reade's euphemisms for
port and sherry respectively). While
he was preparing his series of articles
on Old Testament characters he read
what he had written to John Coleman
on one occasion and came to this star
tling passage in his argument:
"Having now arrived at this conclu
sion, we must go the whole hog or
none."
Coleman objected to this phrase.
"You don't like the hog, I see," said
Reade. "Well, It's a strong figure of
speech, and it's understanded of the
people, but— yes, you are right. It's
scarcely Scriptural, so out it goes."—

Bass Are Real Cute.
It is related for a fact that the reason
bass jump— and it is common practice
of the fish — is because they wish to ac
quire grace and strength in testing
their ability against that of fishermen.
Several men who say they know
what they are talking about point out
that bass do most of their jumping
during the spring and are especially
active just before the open season be
gins.
At this time they may be seen doing
long distance jumps, somersaults and
side stepping.
One bass expert goes so far as to say
that he spent an entire afternoon
watching a three pound bass dragging
a long willow sapling through the
water and acting as if it were caught
on a hook.
Leaping into the air, it would turn
in a half circle as if to disgorge the
barb, and then it would swim back
ward in an endeavor to snap the
branch.
This fisherman asserts that what
jumping the bass do during the sum
mer is merely to keep in practice and
not get stale.— Philadelphia North
American.
Improving Nature.
To "paint the lily; to gild refined
gold," when taken in a literal sense,
seem processes too absurd for serious
deliberation. Flowers of unnatural
hues, however, bloom In florists' win
dows, and the color green as applied
to the carnation is ho longer confined
to the title of a book. But the Persians
do even worse things in the name of
beauty. They dress up their flowers,
according to Mr. Wills In "The Land
of Lion and Sun."
Persia is not a land of flowers. Zin
nias, convolvulus, asters, balsams, wall
flowers, chrysanthemums, marigolds
and roses are the principal blooms of
the country.
The Persians, not content with the
plain flower, cut rings of colored pa
per, cloth or velvet and ornament the
bloom, placing the circles of divers
hues between the first and second rows
of petals.
The effect is strange. One, at first
glance, supposes he sees a bouquet of
curious and bizarre flowers of entirely
new varieties.
The Boomerang and Its Inventors.
The boomerang is rather a puzzle.
One might think that the highest laws
of mathematics had been laid under
contribution in the perfecting of it.
The convexity on one side, the flatness
on the other and the sharp, knlfelike
edge on the Inside of the convexity
have the air of having been carefully
thought out. Yet the people who In
vented this singular weapon cannot
count higher than five and are desti
tute of all the arts and amenities of
life. Theirs is perhaps the lowest
plane of human life. Some people have
assumed that the boomerang was the
creation of an older and higher civili
zation, but for this there is no evidence.
It must be the product of an age long
empirical use of throwing weapons.—

Glass Cutting.
The layman who is introduced to the
mysteries of cutting glass for the first
time Is amazed at the amount of work
that the workman does entirely by his
eye. The first stage of the bowl which
is to be cut finds it in a perfectly plain
condition, not a scratch upon it and
only a half dozen or more marks in red
chalk, which mean absolutely nothing
to the unpracticed eye. But to the
workman they mean the whole pat
tern. Perhaps the dish is a salad bowl.
The marks in chalk will run from the
edge, five intervals apart, down to the
center of the bowl at the bottom. In
one of the divisions of the bowl thus
i marked there may be 8 little further
marking in the shape perhaps of a
diamond. This indicates the pattern
into which the bowl is to be cut, and
it will be repeated In each of the five
divisions. All the intricacies of the
design the workman has In his head,
and they develop on the slass in a way
j which seems to the looker on absolute-
I ly marvelous.— New York Times.
BOOK PLATES.
They Came Within Fifty Years After!
the Invention of Printing.
It was within half a century from
the invention of printing that book I
plates were introduced as identifying
marks to indicate the ownership of the
volume.
Germany, the fatherland of printing ■
from movable type and of wood cut-.
ting for making Impressions in ink ou
paper, is likewise the home land of
the book plate.
The earliest dated woodcut of ac
cepted authenticity is the well known
"St. Christopher of 1423," which was
discovered in the Carthusian monas- '
tery of Buxueim, in Suabia.
It was to insure the right of owner
ship in a book that the owner had it
marked with the coat of arms of the
family or some other heraldic device.
Libraries were kept intact and passed
from generation to generation, bearing
the emblem of the family.
The first book plate in France is dat
ed 1574: iv Sweden, 1575; Switzerland,
IGO7, and Italy, 1023. The earliest Eng
lish book plate is found in a folio vol
ume once the property of Cardinal Wol
sey and afterward belonging to his
royal master.
The earliest mention of the book
plata in English literature Is by Pepys,
July IG, IGSS. The first known book
plate in America belonged to Governor
Dudley. Paul Revere, the patriot, was
one of the first American engravers of
book plates and a designer of great
ability.— Journal of American History.
THE FLYING FOX.
Curious Inhabitant of the Forests In
Eastern Australia.
The flying fox Is a very curious in
habitant of the forest near Moreton
bay, in east Australia. It lives in
flocks and moves generally toward the
dusk of the evening, and the noise pro
duced by the heavy flapping of the so
called wings is very singular. The
flocks like quiet places, where there
are large araucarian pine trees, with
an underwood of scrub and creepers.
The foxes hang in vast numbers from
horizontal branches of the pine trees.
When there is a clear space among
the trees an enormous number of the
animals may be seeu, and their noise
can be heard, for directly they see any
thing unusual they utter a short bark,
something like the sound made by
young rooks. Often every branch Is
crowded, and the young foxes are seen
either flapping their wings and holding
on with their hind feet and with their
heads downward or snarling and fight
ing for places.
Suddenly the whole take to flight and
flap their furry, wiuglike sides and
wheel around like heavy birds. Many
fly with their young holding on to
them.
The creature Is not a true fox, and
there Is a fold of skin which reaches
from the fore to the hind legs. This Is
called the wing, and it enables the
pteropus, as the animal Is called, to
float and turn in the air.
Obsolete Cures.
It was formerly believed that epi
lepsy could be cured by wearing a j
silver ring made from a coffin nail.
Seven drops of blood from the tall of 1
a cat and blood from a recently execut- '
ed criminal were said to be valuable '
remedies for epilepsy. To cure a '
felon or run around hold the finger In
a cat's ear for half an hour. For tooth
ache trim your finger nails on Friday
or eat bread that a mouse has nibbled '
or carry in your pocket a tooth from '
a soldier killed in battle. For ranula '
of the tongue spit on a frog. For al- '
coholistn drown an eel in brandy and '
make the drunkard drink /the brandy. '
To cure warts rub the wart with a po- '
tato and feed the potato to a pig. I '
Glued Clothes.
"In Korea," said a tailor, "needle
and thread. are unknown to tailoring.
Their place is taken by glue."
"Glue?"
"Glue— a peculiarly fine glue made
of fish. Making Korean clothes, the
tailor does not bring two edges of
cloth together and then slowly and
painfully unite them with fine stitches
of the needle. No; he overlaps the
edges slightly, brushes on a little glue,
presses the seam together and sets the
garment away to dry.

found that they lasted almost as well
as sewed ones."— New Orleans Times-

I An Incident of Revolutionary Ddys In
South Carolina.
There are Innumerable stories of
Revolutionary days In Charleston. The
old ladles used to tell with glee how,
when the British were supposed to be
out of the way, the young fellows
! would come home to dance with them.
A message would go to the nearest
cousins and friends and a supper be
cooked. It might be only rice and ba
con, but it was good to hungry men,
declares Charleston's historian, Mrs.
Uuvenal. The dance and tifc feast
tvould continue until the stars grew
pale.
Often these merrymakings were dis
turbed by the enemy, but there was al
ways a negro or two on the watch, and
the harsh note of the screetch owl or
the cry of the whlppoorwlll would give
the alarm, then "partings in hot
baste," a rush for the horses, a sharp
scuffle, a hot pursuit and perhaps a
prisoner taken.
The young men had odd adventures.
One young fellow betrayed himself by
his appetite. He was pursued and had
taken shelter at Mrs. Motte's place, on
South Santee. She rolled him up in a
carpet and, pushing it against the wall,
told him to keep quiet until the enemy
had gone and she could release him.
Unluckily he heard through the open
window his hostess giving directions to
the cook about the chickens which
were to be dressed for the dragoons' ;
dinner. He could not bear to be left .
out and thrust his head from the car
pet chrysalis and cried out, "Keep the
giblets for me!"
The soldiers heard, and he was at
once caught and carried off to repent
at leisure of bis indiscretion.
DOUGHERTY ISLAND.
It I* tht Most Remote and Desolate
Spot on Earth.
Which Is the loneliest, most desolate
and most Inaccessible Island on the
face of the globe? Many, people would
doubtless plump for one of the Crozets,
in the south Atlantic ocean. And yet
Hog island, the westernmost of the
group, is by no means an undesirable
place of residence, abounding as It
does in hares and rabbits, penguins,
albatrosses and sea elephants.
Herd island, in the same seas, is
far more isolated as well as more bar
ren, but it possesses, as does Hog, a
shelter hut for castaways, and it Is
visited by whalers occasionally. So,
too, is South Georgia, but it has no
shelter hut, and as it is right out of
the track of shipping any one unlucky
enough to be cast away thereon would
stand a very poor chance of ever get
ting off alive.
Bouvet island, in the same seas. Is
visited even more rarely, and on the
last occasion when a ship touched
there five corpses were found frozen
on the beach, grim mementos of some
unrecorded tragedy of the sea. Pos
session island, in its turn, is still
lonelier and more inhospitable than
Bouvet
But probably the palm in this direc
tion must be ascribed to Dougherty
island, on which, so far as is known,
no landing has ever been effected. It
has only been sighted twice in a cen
tury and is officially described in the
admiralty sailing directions as "the
most remote and isolated spot on
earth."— Pearson's Weekly.
Eyes Keen For Colors.
A young man who had made applica- !
tion for the position of clerk in the
silk department of a large store was
questioned closely as to the exact
shade of a great variety of samples
shown him. "We do that," the super
intendent explained, "to make sure
that you are not color blind. A dry
goods store Is the one place where
color blindness is a positive bar to
efficiency. Very often you hear of
color blind workmen In all other
branches of business. There are, it ap
pears, even color blind engineers and
color blind artists, but the big stores
absolutely shut out men who have not
a keen eye for all colors."— New York

Absentminded.
She was an exceedingly dainty lit
tle woman, who was taking a very
great interest in the welfare of the ,
convicts when she was being shown
through the penitentiary the other day.
Guard O'Brien was along when she
happened to speak to one of the prison
ers. "I am so sorry for you," she re
marked in a tender tone of voice. "Of
course you will be very thankful when
the time comes for you to leave this
dreadful place."
"No," retorted the man. "I'd a sight
rather stop here where I am." The
little woman almost collapsed.
"Isn't It strange?" she asked, turn-
Ing to the guard. "I had no idea the
prisoners were so contented. What
was the poor fellow's offense?"
The guard concealed a covert grin.
"He was just a little absentminded,
that was all," followed the grin.
"Absentminded!" exclaimed his as

"Yes, madam," politely replied

How Will the World End?
It has always been an Intensely In
teresting conjecture to scientists and,
at the same time, the greater part of
the other Intelligent members of soci
ety as to the way In which our world
will at length come to an end. Many
think that it will be through the gradu
al cooling of the sun, which will even
tually fall to give out sufficient heat
to sustain life on our planet But an
other—and a particularly unpleasant
fate that might befall us Is explained
In a work by Mr. Ellard Gore. "Real
danger," says he, "Is always to be
feared from the presence of immense
dark bodies, moving unseen in space,
vast dead suns, whose collision with
our own would Increase its heat
enormously and thus Instantly destroy
the earth." We should not, however,
be without a warning of our terrible
