Sane Fourth Is
Official Order
We are authorized to state, that the
ordinance prohibiting all kinds of fire
works and explosives within the city
limits will be strictly enforced on the
4th of July. There will be no suspen
sion of the law, so as to enable dealers
to dispose of their stock, and the ' small
boys to get rid of a lot of noisy patrio
tism, as has been done in past years.
This notice is published weeks in ad
vance, so that those who have been' ac
customed to dealing in such goods may
govern themselves accordingly. We ure
sure every property holder in this city
will be gratified to hear of this good
resolution. Every fourth of July, with
its outrageous demonstration in explo
sives by boys and grown ups, has been
a menace, and those having their all at
stake have felt a relief when the day
has passed without serious damage from
fire. The gunpowder plot will not be
tolerated this year. Anyone Indulging
in the prohibited pastime within the
boundaries of Jackson will be promptly
landed in the calahoose.
Delegates Elected-
At the last meeting of Ursula parlor of
Native Daughters delegates to the grand
parlor, which assembles in Santa Bar
bara in June, were elected as follows:
Flora Gilbert, Nellie Ginocchio and
Lena Herein. Alternates. Mary Going,
Flora Podesta and Nellie Fontenrose.
DITCH TENDER
FOUND DEAD
Tobia Ferrasci Discover
ed In Canal Above
Petty Reservoir
Tobia Ferrasci. ditch tender for the
Pacific Gas and Electric Corporation,
whose beat extended above the Petty
reservoir for several miles, was found
dead in the canal, at a point about a
auarter of a mile above the Petty reser
voir, about 7 o'clock Monday morning,
under circumstances that left no room to
doubt that he met his untimely end by
accidental falling into the ditch.
About three years ago a terrible cala
mity befell the Ferrasci family, all the
members of the family then seven in
number being seized with mysterious
sickness after partaking of some horns
preserved beans. The sickness was
dignosed as ptomain poisoning, caused
by the beans. Ferrasci alone escaped
severe sickness, he having partaken of
the meal very sparingly. l ( 'our of the
family — Mrs Ferrasci and two children,
a hoy and a girl, and also a niece, Miss
Amelia Cattini, died. Mrs Canonica,
a neighbor, partook of the fatal dish,
and also perished, making five victims.
One other child, belonging to Mrs
Canonica, lived through the ordeal,
after a desperate struggle with the
strange malady. The tragedy left Fer
rasci and three children constituting the
family. After this calamity Ferrasci
deemed it advisable to leave the place
assoociated in his mind with such
awful memories. He went to Reno, but
afterwards came back to California,
finding employment in Butte county.
About one year ago he returned to Ama
dor, and resumed his position as ditch
tender on his old beat above Clinton,
the family occupying the same premises
as formerly, the oldest daughter— a girl
of about twenty years, having charge of
the household and looking after her two
sisters, aged about nine and six years.

Services at the
. Episcopal Church
Rev. John T. Shurtleff, preached a
very interesting sermon at the Episcopal
church, Jackson last Sunday morning.
The subject was taken from the 34th
chapter of Genesis and the 27th verse:
"While 1 was in the way the Lord led
me. " The text was composed with the
life of Elisur, the stuart of Damascus,
and that of a loafer on thz street corner,
and the clergyman pointed out most dis
tinctly how God will assist all those
who are traveling in the way of holi
ness.
The bishop of Sacramento has de
putized Rev. Shurtleff to visit all the
churches in this district, aud endeavor
to collect $20,000, which will be added
to the 850,000 already subscribed, and
which is intended to be used in mak
ing this diocese self sustaining.
Rev. Shurtleff informs us that the
bishop will in the near future send a
pastor to the Jackson church.
School Census
Complete returns have been received
Iti the office of school superintendent W
H. Greenhalgh of the census taking of
school children in the respective dis
tricts of Amador connty. The total num
ber of children is 2151), against a total
of 2129 reported last year, showing a net
gain of 30 for the year. We shall give
the tabulated eeturns next week.
Miner Injured
George Milojevicb met with an acci
dent at the Fremont mine* Saturday last.
The unfortunate man was working in a
stope above the 13(X) level when a large
rock fell on his ' foot crushing it.
Milojevich was knocked into the stupe
and fell to the drift below, injuring his
leg and back. The injured man was
treuted by a doctor In Amador until
Wednesday last, when he was brought
to the home of his cousin, John
Milojevich on Broawday. Dr. Gall is
now giving the injured miner attention,
Drummers Win
Base Ball Game
Last Sunday afternoon Jackson local
sports were treated to a game of ball,
which was all that could be expected
under the circumstances.
Several old baseball enthusiustics,
who are now on the road traveling as
salesmen, met at the National hotel, and
upon learning that no game was to be
played in Jackson on that day, scraped a
team of drummers together, and in them
challenge anything in Jackson. Dr.
Endicott, who carries a considerable
amount of blue blood in his veins, ac
cepted the offer, and immediately pro
ceeded to get a team together. The two
teams were secured, and the game was
started with the understanding that the
losing side would have to pay for car*
riage hire and supper.
The game was called at 2:30, and
started with all the pomp and dignity
that can'grace a baseball diamond.
The commercial men had the advan
tage it seems throughout the entire
game, by having a fresh pitcher, al
though the doctor fought every inch of
the ground, and was by no means a de
feated hero at heart, although one in
reality, as far as his team was con
cerned, as the score stood 19 to 12 in
the traveler's favor.
Several grand stand plays were made,
and the large crowd that attended the
unheralded game, were well satisfied
with the playing of both teams.
Sentenced for Theft
A man named W N Thompson was
sentenced in lone to pay $30 or thirty
day for stealing $25 from a man at Kerr
station last Saturday. He grabbed the
man's purse from the bar as the owner's
attention was directed to his horses. He
pleaded guilty, the money being fcund
on him when arrested.
LIMEROCK CO.
INCORPORATED
Property Lying Between
Sutter Creek and lone
to be Developed
On Tuesday last articles of Incor
poration of the Arnador Limerock Com
pany were adopted and as soon
as all signatures are obtained,
will be filed in the office of the
county clerk, and a certified copy of the
same was forwarded to the secretary of
state in Sacramento. The company is
organized mainly to purchase the lands
containing large limestone deposits in
the vicinity of Alt. Echo, midway be
tween Sutter Creek and lone, on the
lands of Gebhardt, Sibole and Hender
son, ard develop these deposits for
lime-making, cement and sugar refining
purposes. The capital stock is $75,000,
divided into a like number of shares
a 81 each. The directors, five in
number, named for the first years are
W. F. Detert, A. Ginocchio, Geo. W.
Brown, Richard Webb, and Jacob New
man. The number of shares factually
subscribed and paid for is 225, nine
persons subscribing for twenty-five
shares each. In addition to this all the
stock has been placed, and will be
called in as needed, ten per cent being
payable on the issue of preliminary cer
tificates, anl the balance on instalments
as required. The intention is to start
development work at once, the first step
being to ascertain the extent of the de
posits by uncovering the ledge at a
number of places, so as to get an idea
of the character of equipment to instal
to place the enterprise on a working
basis. The property bonded by the
company embraces about 300 acres, and
the price fixed for the vhole is $IG.
000, payable in instalments extending
over a period of over two years., the
first payment of ten per cent being due
in July next. From this time on,
things will be moving at a lively gait
around limestone deposits of Mt. Echo.
On Wagon Trip to Ohio
A family named Holten, camped just
north of Jackson, from Sunday night
until Wednesday, in a tent and a large
covered wagon. The man and wife
with 5 small children, left San Fran
cisco a few weeks ago, with a wagon
load of supplies and bedding, intending
to travel overland to Ohio in the wagon,
which they specially equipped for the
journey. The wife speaks very en
thusiastically of the distances, and ex
perience already covered, and is empha
tic in her assertion that they will suc
ceed in their I under taking.
MINE NEWS
ALONG LODE
Interesting Accounts of
Mines Located In
Amador Co.
Bunker Hill
At this mine£the drift at the 1050 foot
level has been advanced over 100 feet
into the ore shoot, the ledge so far show
ing all the characteristics of that opened
up in the 1750 level. So far as it has
been penetrated, the grade of ore is
low— most of it too low to mill. This
was the experience in the level above at
the same point. This is nothing more
than was anticipated. The superior
grade of ore is not looked for until the
drift has been extended about two
hundred feet further, and this will take
from five to six weeks more. Everthing
looks favorable for just the same kind
of rich rock as appears in the 1750
drift, where the rich ore body has been
drifted upon for over 800 feet, from 10
to 15 feet wide, some of it of bonanza
character, and all good milling ore.
The limits of this remarkable shoot has
not been reached yet. The last clean
up was over 824,000 for the month,
leaving a goodly sum to be carried to
the surplus after paying the usual
monthly dividend of five cents per
shae.
The directors this month decided that
an extra dividend was in order, and
gave the stockholders ten cents per share
in addition to the usual disbursement of
five cents per share. This makes fifteen
cents per share, which will be paid on
the 15th, making $30,000 in dividends
for one month with a 20 stamp mill. Can
a better showing be made by any mine
on the coast with like milling capacity.
The stock is stiffening in price, $7 per
share being refused a few days ago.
Central Eureka
A report was circulated last Saturday
that a disaster happened at this mine on
account of breaking into the old works,
and thereby Hooding the drift where the
miners were at work with the im
prisoned waters from the former excava
tions. Inquiry of the superintendent
set ail these rumors of disaster at rest.
The old works wer« tapped, it is true,
and this was in accordance with the
plans of the managements, and to en
sure the safety of the employes. No
damage resulted, and the employes were
not endangered by the experience. The
sinking operations have been diverted
from the old shaft, so as to ensure
stability. Everything is moving along
satisfactorily, and it is generally be
lieved that this famous dividend-payer
of a few years ago will soon begin to re
imburse the stockholders for the heavy
outlay incurred in the reopening of the
mine.
Levaggl
This quartz claim is located on the
trend cf the main gold belt, and lies
about a mile and a half north of Ply
mouth. Recently a company of eastern
capitalists have secured an option on
the property, and are proceeding to
operate it. A ten stamp mill is being
erected, and is now nearing completion.
It is expected that it will be in running
order in two weeks. Everything in
dicates that a paying mine will be
opened on this mine.
Kennedy
The ore body at the 3300 level is pro
ving of larger size, and fully as rich in
precious metal as the level above. From
the massive bodies of milling ore in
sight there is no trouble in keeping the
big 100 stamp mill in steady operation
to its utmost capacity. Last month a
dividend of 15 cents per share was paid.
Preparations are being made to sink the
shaft ICO feet deeper.
Supervisor Grillo Sinking
A message was received by the rela^
tives of supervisor A. Grillo in Volcano
last night announcing that the latter's
condition was alarming, and stating that
they must hurry to bedside in Stockton
to meet him again in life. John Grillo
left for that city this morning.
Supervisor Grillo was seized with a
severe sinking spell while in Jackson
attending ihe board of supervisors last
week. When he returned to Stockton
from here, he had to be carried from
the train to the place where he was

JACKSON TRIMS
COMANCHE
Game Was Won by Score
of 9 to 3 in Favor of
Jackson
Many new features of the possibilities
of Jackson's baseball team were brought
out in the game with Camanche, on
Saturday last, at lone.
This was the hardest team Jackson
has met this season, and although the
score was 3 to 9 in Jackson's favor,
the latter had to work hard to keep the
opponents under hand. Arditto really
deserves credit for winning the game,
as it was a pitcher's battle, and the only
pitcher in the battle was Arditto. Had
the Camanche team used .Jackson's
pitcher, or one like him, the score
against the local would have betn con
siderably different, as the rest of the
Camanche team played excellent ball.
A very remarkable play was pulled off
by Myers, who covered left field. A
clean ball was sent out into his territory
and after a Rood chase after it, left
fielder caught it, and at the same time
threw it perfectly true to home plate,
putting a runner out at the plate.
Vela, the center field hero, is alsc
showing great shape. His batting is all
that can be expected, and he brings down
every reasonable ball that reaches his
section.
Fortner is fast becoming a star at
catching, his team work and good judg
ment were used to advantage all through
the game. Fortner also bats a hard ball
and is a good runner.
A decision by umpire Kirby, nearly
resutled in a repetition of the Sutter
Creek and Jackson game. Skellv was
on the second base and tried to steal
third, when the ball was thrown flyer* ""
the plate, the batter struck a foul tip
and ran for first base, he was put out at
first, but Skelly, who saw the ball in
action did not return to second, but
stole third. The ball was thrown to
second base, and the runner declared
out. A wrangle ensued and the
Camanchc players were about to pack up
and leave, when Jackson allowed them
the put out which retired the team for
ths inning. •
The game was very much enjoyed by
all who attended, and was one of the
leading events of the picnic.
While the team is all that can be ex
pected, the methods of those who
manage the team's welfare is proving to
be decidedly wrong. The official score
keeper, R. Scott, employed by the Dis
patch, is allowed to hold the score book
as private property, and he having per
sonal animosity against the Ledger re
fuses to allow us to copy for our readers
who attend the game, a record of the
team's work.

Picnic Proved
A Grand Success
The picnic held at lone last Saturday
was a success throughout the entire pro
gram.
The Knights of Pythias lodge. No.
48, had charge of the event, and deserve
great credit for giving those who at
tended, all the enjoyment they could
wish for. The morning was devoted to
a parade, which started at 10:30. The
Uniform rank, K. of P., several Heats
beautifully decorated, and the Foresters
of America, were part of the long line
of marchers. The Jackson Military
band headed the procession. A game of
ball between the Jackson K. of P. and
lone K. of P., was won by lone team.
A large dance platform was erected in
the park, and heie the band' furnished
music for those who desired to dance.
A shoot, cowboy race, buggy race and
baseball game were the leading features
of the afternoon.
At 4p. m., the center of attraction
was Main street, where all kinds of
races were indulged in. The closing
features of the program wasj a dance
held in the pavilion. This was largely
attended, and lasted until the early
hours of Sunday morning.
Several trains were run from Martell
to lone, carrying passengers from Sutter
Creek and Jackson. All available car
riages at the local liveries were engaged
by Jackson's young folks who attended
the picnic.BS2IRKD AT THE piißTornrf! AT JACKSOif AS RRCONIi-cr.ASS MATTER.

A MEDICAL REVOLUTION.
There is no field of human investigation that has advanced
more rapidly of late years than the science of medicine and
surgery. If anything it has more than kept pace with the
progress in other departments of effort. The germ theory
has revolutionized the practice of medicine. Dr Jenner, when
He proclaimed the theretofore unheard-of theory of inocula
tion a preventive of disease, and applied it to stay the ravages
of one of the greatest scourges of the human race — smallpox,
sounded a keynote of (progress which has been wonderfully
enlarged upon since his day. His idea was to introduce a
mild and easily controlled form of disease ss a preventive of
the same disease in its malignant form. Practitioners of the
orthodox school scouted his advanced ideas, and Renounced
him as a dreamer and a wanderer from the established paths
of his profession. But the truth which he so boldly advo
cated slowly worked its way, in face of persistent opposition,
to an abiding place in the universally accepted truths of
medical science. Indeed, the germ theory of the origin and
cure of disease is belived to promise more for the ameliora
tion of the human race than any other method of treatment.
Consumption, cancer, and some other plagues, hitherto re
garded as incurable, are being treated by the anti-toxin
method with marked success. In some instances, complete
cures are claimed of these diseases when taken in their early
stages, and the hope is confidently held out that in years to
come the mortality from these maladies will be materially
reduced, Disease in its infinite variety of forms is simply
a contest for supremacy between antagonistic forces in the
blood; in other words, between disease prodncing and disease
resisting germs. The advance or decline of the malady is
determined as one or the other of these contending armies
'•-is-in the ascendant.. It is more or less true, that the life of
every person is a constant battle between the marshaled
hosts of health and disease in the shape of disease. This is
in conformity with that law of nature by which one form of
life preys upon another. Men differ in their disease repel
ling powers fully as much as they do in mental and physi
cal respects. In some the health preserving germs are so
active and strong, that disease bearing germs of every des
cription are unable to secure a foothold. Unhealthy microbes
may be introduced in millions, but they are .killed or neu
tralized without the least apparent disturbance of the general
health. r The constitution of another individual maybe
bomb-proof as it were against one species of germ, and afford
a fruitful soil for the propagation of another hostile germ.
Thus the citadel of health may be strongly fortified against
fever for | instance, and easily susceptible to attack from
another quarter. Now the drift of medical science, by tht
use of anti-toxins in combatting disease, is to reinforce the
vulnerable spots by the introduction into the system of the
patient of the fighting germs of the particular form of disease
from which he is suffering. That is to say, by the introduc
tion of new blood from outside sources — blood richly endowed
with those elements which are lacking in the patient's; con
stituion — the battle line is thereby reinforced at its weakest
point at the most critical time. The resistant forces are in
this way placed in the ascendant, and if this condition results
■the patient recovers. Marvelous cures have already been
achieved by this treatment, and the process is yet in .its in
fancy.' Even the culture of the disease-fighting germs is
a vitally important branch of medical science.
As candidates for county offices will soon get busy in cir
culating nomination papers, it is in order to state that there
is room for a difference of opinion as to method of obtaining
signers. On this point the law governing county officials
says the petitions must be signed "by at least three per
centuni of the party vote in at least one-fourth of all the
election precincts, and in the aggregate not less than three
per ccu tun: nor more than ten per centum of the total vote
of the party' 1 in the county. This is interpreted to mean
that at least three per cent of the party vote must be obtained
in every precinct represented on the petition. For instance,
two signers in a precinct casting ioo votes for the party
would count for nothing, not even figuring in the aggregate
of three per cent for the entire county. Republican county
candidates must get not less than 32 qualified signers all
told, and not exceeding 104. The aim should be to get not
less than 5 per cent of each precinct canvassed, and an aggre
gate of between 50 and 60 signers. To do this will require
a canvass of ten to fifteen precincts, including the heaviest
voting precincts.
ANCIENT ORDER
OF DRUIDS
Install Officers and Hold
Very Enjoyable En
tertainment
Jackson Grove No. 1 14 ' United An
cient Order of Druids, and its affiliated
lodge, Fieri d Italh. Circle No. 71, held
a most enjoyable official meet and joint
entertainment in Odd Fellows Hall on
Sunday evening last. The hall was
elaborately decorated for the occasion by
the deft hands of the lady members,
and a large number of invited friends
were present to witness the exercises
and participate in the festivities,
the newly elected officers were instilled,
R. Belluzzi being the officiating district
deputy for Jackson Grove, and D.

Big Fish Caught
In Jackson Creek
For many years fish have been a
novelty in the branches of Jackson creek
flowing through the city. The south
fork, several miles above the city, was
stocked with fish several years ago by
some enterprising ranchers living along
its banks, and they thrived and multi
plied greatly, until the anglers from
Jackson got wind of their presence and
raided the forbidden territory thereby
dampening the ardor of those who were
trying to restock that stream. The
middle and north forks of the creek
have been devoid of the finny tribe, at
least so it was generally supposed. For
the past year or two the middle fork has
been free from mining debris, which of
course is fatal to fish. Last Sunday
some boys were angling for the fish
within the city limits, behind the hos
pital grounds. Lewis Lamb, a veteran
angler, came along, and threw his line
into a deep place, and in a twinkling
pulled out a fine specimen of brook
trout, measuring ten inches in length.
This is the first catch ot the kind inside
the town limits that we have any know
ledge of within the past thirty-five
years. It was probably an escape from
the Mokelumne river, that came through
the Amador canal into the New York
ranch reservoir, and thence into the
middle fork.

this effective, providing for the trans
portation of children living more than
two miles from school.

Services at
Methodist Church
On Sunday morning, May -15, the
pastor will preach on "What Chris
tianity has done for women." He will
speak of women under the old Roman
law, and under early Tentonic sway, and
under the oldest and best religions of
the east.
He will speak of the conditions of
women under the teachings of Con
fucius and of Buddha and of Brahma,
and of Mohammed and then give the
bible idea of woman, and prove that
the lofty position held by women to-day
is due to Christianity.
The church should] be filled with
women to hear this important subject
discussed. All are cordially invited.
In the evening the subject will be
"Repentance and its effects." The
public is invited to both services.

Woman More than 100

Airs Castilda Rodriguez, who says she
is more than 100 years old, lies in a
dying condition at the Central Emer
gency Hospital as the result of injuries
inflicted by an unknown man, who, she
says, attacked her with a hatchet. De
tectives Bell, and policeman Powers
have been in a search for her assail
ants, but so far have failed to find a
clew to their identity.
Mrs Rodriguez was found by small
boys lying on the floor of her home at
78 Alta street. She was unconscious,
and the blood was flowing from
numerous ugly gashes in her head and
face. She regained consciousness after
removal to the Central Emergency
Hospital, and told the pol>"ce that she
had been attacked by a stranger, who
called at the house to see her husband.
The police have been unable to locate
either stranger or the husband of the in
jured woman.

SACRAMENTO
Candy As Food
Ably Discussed
Anxious mothers, says a "writer on
household topics in the Boston Herald,
who read what is said on both sides of
the sweet question, and who want to
take good care of their children's
health, but not to deny them any harm
less pleasure, must be sadly perplexed.
One class of writers consider sugar in
any shape as next to poison, and seem
to hold it responsible for hair the ills of
life. If you follow their teachings, you
will feel it criminal to let a child ever
taste sweets.
On the other side, we read how very
nourishing sugar is, how different
governments give their soldiers extra
rations of sugar when there are special
demands on their strength and endur
ance. Then there are reports of fatten
ing cattle on treacle, and interesting
items on the tine teeth and good health
of the negroes on sugar plantations, and
the great amount of sugar cane they eat.
Reading such articles one might think
it a duty to give children all the sugar
they want.
Both views are extreme and not ap
plicable to the case. The tine teeth of
most negroes is a race characteristic,
and probably is no more affected by
their diet than is their kinky hair, and
children don't have to do the work of
sodiers or plantation hands. But a lik
ing for sweets is surely a natural taste.
All domestic and most wild animals are
fond of sugar and honey; and all chil
dren and most grown people like sweets
so well that it's a pity they should not
have a reasonable amount if it does not
do them any real harm.
Dr. Woods Hutchinson in a late lec
ture on the subject .carries the discus
sion further along. He says :
"Give children plenty of pure sugar,
taffy and butterscotch, and they'll have
little need of cod liver oil. In short,
sugar is. after meat, bread and butter,
easily our next important and necessary
food. You can put the matter to a test
very easily. Just leave off the pie,
pudding and other desserts at your lunch
or midday dinner. You'll be astonished
to find out how quickly you'll feel
'empty' again, and how "unfinished'
the meal will seem. You can't get any
workman to accept a dinner pail with
out pie in it. And he's absolutely
right. The only thing tiiat can take the
place of sugar is beer or wine. It is a
significant fact that the free lunch
■counters run in connection with bars
furnish every imaginable thing except
sweets. Even the restaurants and lunch
grills attached to saloons or bars often
refuse to serve deserts of any sort.
They know their business. The more
sugar and sweets a man takes at a meal
the less alcohol he wants. Conversely,
nearly every drinking man will tell you
he has lost his taste for sweets. The
more candy a nation consumes, the less
alcohol.

Valuable Horse
In Smash Up
A horse trainer named Hartte, met
with an accident last week that might
have proved very disastrous, but which
turned out to] be trifling. Hartte was
driving Duke, a pacing stallion along
the county road near Amador at a pretty
good gate, when his cart.struck a pile
of rocks in the madwav. and the shaft
snapped. The driver was thrown to the
roadway.^and the horse ran into an in
closure at the Keystone mine, and there
fell and was captured by miners, and
taken to the livery stable where his
owner received him.
THE UMPIRE WAS GAME.
And He Made ths Kickers Play Out
the Latt Inning.
Speaking of tbo doings of the veter*
an umpires, an old timer claims that
Honest John Kelly Is entitled to tha
record for frenk doings among tlie in*
illrntor handlers. Back in the Amcri*
cnn association clays, In n pimp played
on t.ho old Union grounds In Alleghe
ny, Galvln was pitching for rittsburg
against Casey of the Athletics. Kelly
wns the umpire. In the ninth inning,
with tho score 5 to 0 in favor
of tho Athletics, the first man up for
Plttsburg made n home run hit to cen
ter, and the visiting team at once set
up claim that it was too dark to play.
The center fielder came all the wny
In and pretended that he could not sea
the ball in tho gathering darkness.
"Hero," said Kelly; "give mo n. glove."
and with that ho started for center
(leld. "I'll see how dark It 13 out there."
ho said. "You, Casey and Galvln. bat
mo out a few." Players and specta
tors gasped, but Kelly made good his
bluff. lie went out to deep center
and. with tho smoke of the mills lying
low about him. actually caught ten or
fifteen long line drives and high flics
from the bats of the two pitchers with
out missing one.'
Then tho umpire came In nnd, taking
off hla glove, said: "I'lay ball. If I can
see 'em out there, you fellows can."
The game was resumed, and the Pitts
burgs won in n great batting rally by
0 to o.— Now York World.
WET AND DRY MOONS.
Old Suporetition and Cold Facts From
the Astronomsrs.
T'uero Is nn old superstition which
dies hard, nnd that is that tho posi
tion of the horns of the new moon
tells what the weather will be. If the
horns of the crescent are on the same
level it will ho!d water, and hence it
13 a dry moon, but if it is tipped up
then tho water will run out. and It ia
a wot moon.
One thing has helped koap this be
lief alive. Tho moon is "dry" i:i tho
part of the spring that is usually fair,
while it is "-wet" during tho season of
autumn rains.
If this •were a sure sign of the
weather we could have our predic
tions published many years in ad
vance, for an astronomer can predict
the exact position of the moon at any
tlmo in tho future.
The cause for the different positions
of the crescent is simple. The moon Is
south of the sun in the autumn and
north of it in spring. The crescent is
found by the light of the sun falling
on tho moon, apd the horns are natu
rally in a line perpendicular to the di
rection of the sun from the moon.
That is -all there is to this old super
stition.—Boston Herald.
Confucius.
Confucius regarded his own life as a
failure. He spoke against ambition,
yet ho coveted high office, nothing less
than that of political adviser to some
great ruler. A man of the highest
lineage In China, he was yet poor and
early supported himself by teaching.
His pupils "showed him an extraordi
nary devotion. The pick of the young
men in his native state of Lv sat at
his feet, and it was they who trans
mitted his tremendous Influence. But
Confucius saw not his immortal suc

DITCH TENDER
FOUND DEAD
Continuedjrom Page I
The exact manner in which Ferrasci
came to his death can only be surmised.
He was alone at the time, but all cir
cumstances point to death from acciden
tal drowning. He was last seen alive
by Cory McKenzie, another employe
along the ditch about five o'clock Sun
day evening,; at half an hour's walk
from the flume where he is believed to
have fallen into the ditch, and more
than five miles above the place where
the, body was afterwards recovered from
its; watery grave. ;< McKenzie did not
speak to him, simply saw him at a dis
tance. The following morning word
was scent along the line of the ditch
that Ferracsi was missing, and a search
was at once instituted. About noon
Monday, John D. Walker, foreman on
the ditch, found the body of the unfor
tunate man in the canal about a quarter
of a mile above the Petty reservoir,
and fully five miles below the Hume
where the mishap is supposed to have
occurred. With the aid of Mr Kimball,
the body was taken from the water, and
afterwards carried to the camp at the
Petty reservoir.
There was a cut across his forehead,
also a slight scalp wound, which may
have been caused by striking against
some object. Roth were evidently made
while living, and recently. His hat
was found lodged against the screen of
the Petty reservoir, a quarter of a mile
below the place where the body was re
covered. U seems that the water had
been turned off the ditch during Sunday,
so as to enable some repairing to be
done. This left the Hume and beat of
the deceased dry that day, and gave him
a rest. A strip of planking eighteen
inches wide placed over the top of the
flume formed a path for the ditchtender
to pass to and fro over his beat. It is
the experience of employes that it is
more difficult to travel over tne flume
when the water is turned off than when
the ditch is full. The theory is that in
crossing this flume, when dry, Ferrasci
lost his balance, and in falling struck
his head against the timber, rendering
him unconscious. That while he lay
helpless the water came along, and he
was drowned.
Coroner H.E. Potter summoned a iury
the same evening. The remains were
brought to Jackson, and the inquest was
held Tuesday morning, before the fol
lowing jurors: Carlo Giovannoni,
John Millosovich, A. B. Arditto, W.
M. Penry jr., H. N. Mason, A. L.
Lucot, W. D. Ould, W. J. Ninnis,
Frank Simcich, Matt Joy and Win.
Tain. The witnesses examined were
John D. Walker,. Cory McKenzie. W.
H. Hipkins, and Beneditto. The jury
returned'a verdict that deceased, Tobia
Ferrasol, was a native of Cognasco,
Switzerland, aged 49 years, and came to
his death on the Bth day or May, 1010,
by accidental drowning in the upper
Standard canal of the Pacific Gas and
Electric Corporation.
deceased was a member of the An
cient United Order of Druids, and the
funeral took place in Jackson yesterday
under the auspices of the local I<> - le,
services in the Catholic church, the rs
mains being deposited by the side of
the other members of the family vho
perished in the disaster of three yc.rs
ago.

opinion that the enterprise is far more

the magnitude of the plant installed to
reduce it. The only reply to queries

STODDARD TRAVEL CLASS.
A Stoddard travel class with the ob
ject, entertainment and istellecutal im
provement, by the study of stoddard
scries, is being organized here. Mrs L.
15. Sinclair of Chicago, has been in
tovn for the last few days organizing a
class.
They will take the study of travels
on the Stoddard course, which will be
embellished by stereopticon lectures,
entertainments, etc. etc., during the
coming winter.
The Stoddard course is becoming
popular in cities and towns, and as
there are some 500.000 patrons to these
lectures, and more than 8,000,000 people
have heard them during the past eighteen
years, while Mr Stoddard was on the
rostrum, it is no wonder itoat the study
of them is a source of pleasure and pro
fit.
The following are patrons of the lec
• ures: Mrs Jas Jay Wright, Minnie T.
Gardella, W. H. Greenhalgto, Mrs Mary
Marelia, W. J. Peters, Mrs Vicini,
Mrs Geo. L. Thomas, Miss Amy Clark,
Mrs Annie Hurst, Judge Fred V. Wood.
The class intends to make the organi
zation a semi-public affair, by inviting
persons at the lectures, and by having
occasional entertainments. At an early
date, they propose to add the functions
of civic improvement club.
Flees for Liberty While
Pardon Awaits Him
Phoenix A. T.— When Juan Ramirez,
a convict from Tucson, decided to take
advantage of his privilege as a trusty
and make a break for liberty, he did
not know that he was fleeing from a
pardon. Ramirez was serving a six
years' term for burglary, and the pardon
arrived at the penitentiary almost at the
moment that his absence was noted.
The pardon was sent back to the gover
nor, and Ramirez is being' hunted as a
fugitive from justice.
JfICKSON TRIMS
COMANCHE
Continued from Page 1
Of the $82 and 35 cents receipts which
the club collected at its last game in
Jackson, we leave our readers to decide
how much of it was paid by Ledger
patrons, and speaking in behalf of our
readers, we suggest that the manager
take some steps in correcting the con
dition of affairs, and refuse to allow any
narrow, selfish disposition to jeopardize
the team's progress.
The Ledger proposes to help the team
In every way it can if proper apprecia
tion is shown, and to expose all manner
of ingratitude which may be shown to
the Ledger and its patrons, in case the
present method of score keeping is not
changed. We «re informed by very en
thusiastic rooters that the policies of the
Scott are absolutely not in accord with
the desires of the team, and positively
obnoxious and unapproved of by others.
An official score keeper should by no
means be allowed to monopolize a pub
lic matter for a certain paper, because
he is so dense as not to be able to un
derstand that in so doing he is injuring
the town and the team. Scott's remark
to the Ledger's reporter, that he would
allow any other paper in the country to
have a copy, but would boycott the
Ledger, warrants his immediate re
moval, if the.. team expects the credit it
iustly deserves.
All communities have narrow-minded
people, and they should not be tolerated
in any official capacity. If the Dispatch
owns the score book, and the team has
no official record of its own, it is about
the poorest management that a team
could have, and the team should see that
its most necessary need be supplied.
Favoritism in public matters is the
poorest example of progress that can be
exhibited, and as our patrons help in
more than one wav in advancing the
team, we shall expect to have no further
trouble in securing a complete account
of the team working in the future.

Jess and helpless, Peter Avondale of
this city was arrested at the instance of
In;is mother-in-law., Mrs William Roose,
«.f this city, and was given a Ihearing
before Mayor Lewis P. Kniffen. It was
a novel case, and the mayor demanded a
full explanation. Mrs Roose explained
that Avondale had a peculiar power in
his eyes, and thtt he possessed com
plete hypnotic control over her, his
v'iife and his children. She said that
every time that he desired to do co, he
managed by a look of his eye to make
their limbs and their tongues useless,
so ithat they sank to the floor speech

chose to release them.
The accused mam, a meek looking
fellow, denied that he had hypnotic
powers or any control over his moiher

him under $500 bail to keep the peace.

Acme Candy Store
Changes Hands.
Joseph Datson, a former resident of
this city, and also of Plymouth for a
number of years, has returned to make
Jackson his home. He was recently
married, and the pair have decided that
there is no better locality for a home
than Amador county. Mr Datson early
this week purchased the stock and good
will of the Acme candy store and ice
cream parlors on Main street from Fred
Eudcy. It is rumored the price paid
was $1000. Mr and Mrs Datson will
conduct the business themselves. This
business is centrally located on the east
side of the main business block. It has
always been a popular resort for ice
cream, cream soda, candies, tomaies,
and other delicacies. Under the new
management it is expected that it will
enjoy ever a greater measure of patro
nage than in the past, as the present
proprietor will aim to , please his
customers by giving them the best
quality of articles that can be had. The

Old Indian Woman
Killed by Man's Blow
A rather staitling sequel has come to
hand regarding the finding of the dead
body of "Oldjaally" the Ipdian woman
on the Sheep Ranch road, mention of
which is made by our Alurphys corres
pondent. As the dead woman was
quite old, and the story told by the
Indians seemed natural enough, it was
at first supposed that the woman had
died a natural death, a.id Coroner
Prince, who had been summoned, com
menced the inquest at the rancheria
under that impression, but when one of
the companions of the dead woman told
his story, another aspect was given to
the case. It appears that this woman,
who though about 65 years of age, had a
husband, John Hodge, a half breed about
22 years of age. In company with him
and his brother, Joe Hodge, aged 18
years and an Indian boy named Roy
Jesus, they started from Murphy's to
Sheep. Ranch. Near Valentes' place on
Indian creek, they concluded to camo
for the night, and from Valente's place
procured two five-pound lard buckets of
wine, which caused the trouble. It was
the boy Jesus, who told of the wine and
the killing. He said that after drink-
ing the Hrst bucket of wine, Joe went
back for more and , while he was gone
John hit the woman on the jaw with his
fist and that she laid down dead. Dr.
Weirich. who performed the autopsy
found that the blow had fractured the
spinal cord at the base of the brain,
causing death. The companion of the
dead woman remained on th 2 spot all
night, building fires on both sides of
the body in a vain attempt to warm it
into life. The next day they reported
the death. The coroner's jury rendered
its verdict in accordance with this
I testimony. A warrant charging murder
1 was sworn out, and Hodge was arrested
and lodged in the jail at Murphys.--

Police Judge Warns a
Wayward Ctrl,
San Francisco.— "What is the end of
this life?" asked Irma Gray of police
Judge Shortall, who had asked her the
same question.
"I will tell you," said the magis
trate. "You are very young, and very
fait, and you tell me that two months
ago you lived in a little interior town.
The end Is really at the morgue. The
road there is sometimes long, some
times short, the time ' being wholly
governed by circumstances; but the
morgue is the last gate, no matter which
road you take in this life you have be
gun."
The girl seemed frightened, and
Judge Shortall sent for Mrs Conlan of
the Detention Home. Later the girl,
with a happier face, entered the court
room with Mrs Conlan and said: '.'I
will do just as this lady says. I am
grateful to you and to her."
"Very well, then. This case is dis
missed," said the judge. •
Murderer Thanks Judge
for Death Sentence
Los Angeles. — Ernest Wirth, wife
murderer, was apparently grateful when
Jude Willis sentenced him to be hanged
in San Quentin prison on June 17.
"Thank you, judge!" he exclaimed,
"Thank you! It is well."
Wirth murdered ris wife, proprie
tress of a rooming house, a few weeks
back by crushing her skull with his
boot heels. They had quarreled over
money matters and she had threatened
suit for divorce. After his arrest and
arraignment he asked that he be per
mitted to plead guilty and that his sen
tence be death on the gallows.
"I killed my wife because I could
not get along with her in this worH,"
he explained in court. "Now I want to
join her in the next and begin all over.
I want death sentence and I hope that
your honor will set at an early date. "
Alienists who examined Wirth pro
nounced him sane.
Wirth's crime was committed, sen
tence was pronounced, and his hanging
will take place on a Friday.
Judge Denies Child's
Petition for Divorce
Seattle! Wash.— "The divorce is de
nied" indignantly explained Judge
Robert L. Lindsay of the superior court
handing down a decision in the suit of
Eva Rogers, a matron of 15, for a
divorce from he husband, Percy Ro
gers, aged 20.
"Hump the idea," ejaculated the
judge. "Things are coming to a pretty
pass when children come up here and
ask for a divorce the same as grown
people. Instead of granting a divorce, 1
recommend that your mothers, both of
whom are present, take you home, place
you across their respective knees, and
get busy with a hairbrush or a
shingle."
Eva Rogers went on the stand and
tearfully told the Judge that her lord
and master had a bad habit of finding
fault with her pies, that he wa-s "al
together too rough" when he played
games with her, and that on. one hor
ribly mortifying occasion he had gone
so far as to box her ears. Apart from
this she had no complaint to make. •
When the head of the Rogers family
took the stsnd, he complained that his
wife had a disagreeable habit of spend
ing his wages by going to nickelodeons
and moving picture shows.
Rail Road Supt.
Gives Hoboes Beating
Willows. — Because he saw a gang of
hoboes burning railroad ties at their
camp, half a mile south of town, H. W.
Sheridan, superintendent of the Sacra
mento division of the Southern Pacific,
stopped his special train, went to the
camp and ordered the hoboes to get out.
One man objected and Sheridian knocked
him down. The whole crowd, number
ing abont fifteen men, then attacked him
and he was forced to tight them all
single-handed, his train being some dis
tance away. With blows and kicks he
eventually routed the entire Rang before
the members of his train crew reached
the spot. The man who appeared to be
the leader of the gang was knocked
down four times before he quit and took
to his heels, followed by the others of
the gang.
When Sheridan was a brakeman on
trains in Utah and Nevada, he became a
terror to hoboes, and he has held to his
reputation throughout his career. The
Sacramento division Mas become the
most unpleasant of any division of any
railroad since he took charge of it.

A Wind Guide for Aeronauts—Myster
ious Trade Diseases— Etner Surveying
for Wireless Telegraphy— Potato Meal
— Temoerature and Fur— Another Meal
for Use— Weight of a Fly In Air-
Electric Smelting Furnaces— The
Sky's Blue.
A unique sign of the times is llr.
Richard Assmann's guide to the winds
of Germany, prepared from the records
of the direction and force of the winds
kept at 49 well-distributed stations for
an average of nearly 21 years. It fur
nishes the aeronaut with an aid corres
ponding to the pilot charts of the ocean
navigator. For each season and each
station, it shows how often, on the
average, the wind blows 'from each of
eight directions, and the average fre
quency of the various degrees of wind
between a calm and hurricane, It in
dicates the best places and times for
making ascents, with the direction air
ships without high power will probably
drift. More than this, it suggests the
best location for airship sheds and
ports, and gives evidence that not only
are places near the coast unsuitable,
but that many inland stations are un
comfortably stormy. Friedrichshafen,
chosen by count Zeppelin for his great
sheds, is an unfavorable place for hand
ling the huge airships. The records
show that it has an average of 24 stormy
days a year, while Celle. has only 22
such days, Berlin and Cassel only 4,
and seven other stations less than 10.
The fast-growing list of "industrial
diseases" is likely to add two
mysterious maladies of South Wales.
Tin-plate workers have pains in the
chest, difficutly of breathing, and wast
ing, and are often obliged to go home
-when the 'wind blows from certain
directions. A flux used Is suspected of
containing some unknown poison. In
the fuel factories, "pitch warts" are
very prevalent, at first causing little
pain or anxiety, but rapidly developing
into cancerous growths. The pitch is
believed to contain some harmful sub
stance that was not present ten years
ago.
A map to shov the ether conductivity
for Hertzia.i waves in different latitudes
is a new German idea. Sunshine les
sens the conductivity, and a wireless
telegraph station of large range in the
north would cover only a much smaller
radius in the tropics.
The conversion of potatoes into a dry
concentrated meal, successfully accom
plished by a Prussian process described
by Consul T. H. Norton, not only pre
sents loss from decay but reduces the
cost of transportation. In Germany
potatoes'are much used for feeding Jdo
mestic animals, and the loss from decay
amounts to about 11 per cent, equivalent
to a value of 828.500,000 annually. The
new process is claimed to be simpler
and mere effective than numerous ear
lier ones brought out by an offer of
$6,000 in prizes. The potatoes are
washed in a large vat, passed into a
mashing machine, pumped into a reser
voir, and then fed between two hollow
cylinders, of perforated plate covered
with linen filtering cloth, the interior
of each cylinder being connected with
an air exhaust. The pressure of the
cylinders and the air suction remove
most of the water. The residual mass
isjtaken by a helical conveyor to small
cars, which pass through a " r hydraulic
press, removing more liquid, and is
then transferred to a revolving drum,
heated at one end by steam-pipes and
cooled at the other by water. Stirred
by prongs in the drum, the dried potato
emerges as coarse meal. This has a
quarter of the original weight f the
tubers and occupies an eight'i of the
space, it smells and tastes like fresh
bread, and analysis shows it to contain
80.69 per cert of carbohydrates, 11.50 of
water, 3.73 of protein, 2.06 of ash, 1.71
of Hber, and 1.03 of fat. If desired the
meal can be compressed into compact
cakes. The residual liquid contains
sugar and dissolved salts, and first yield
ing about 2 per cent of albumen, is used
for irrigating farming land.
Remarkable transformation of a cat's
fur by temperature has been reported by
Prof. A. C. Geddes, of the Dublin
Royal College of Surgeons. An all
black cat was accidentally shut up in the
refrigerating chamber of a small steamer
in Sydney harbor, and was not dis
covered until about 32 days later, when
the ship was off Aden. T he cat was
hardly recognizable, the fur having be
come long and thick, changing nearly to
white on the back. Brought out into
the Intense heat of the Red sea, the
heavy white coat lapidly fell out, and
the black cat was itself again before
London was reached.
Titanium chloride reduced with so
dium, by the method of Nilson nnd
Peterson, yields pure lifnium «s a
metal resembling polished steel. It is
brittle when cold, but at low red heat
can be forged like iron. Though very
hard, it can be shaped with a file.
A flying fly In an empty dinner pail
increased the weight, even though <t
does not touch the pail, according to the
novel discovery reported at Frankfort by
Boeninger, a German engineer. An
empty cylinder having a cover at top and
bottom was suspended from the pan of a
balance. When a fly was placed on the
wall inside the weight was correspond
ingly increased, but when the fly left
the side of the cylinder, flying into the
interior, the balance was not affected.
There was no chance when either the
top lid or the bottom one was removed,
the fly's weight being still recorded,
although it was flying inside. When
both were removed, however, the balance
was disturbed, and only the r eight of
the cylinder was recorded. With the
upper lid on and the lower one off, the
flying fly near the top of the cylinder
was weighed exactly as if suspended
from the lid. No clear explanation
seems to have been reached, but it is
suggested that the air acts like a
stretched spring made to vibrate, and
that a model illustrating the phenomena
could be made.
The success of electric smelting is
indicated by its rapid adoption. A Ger
man authority counts up 114 electric
furnaces that are at work making steel,
and his list is incomplete, some im
portant omissions having been pointed
out. Of those enumerated, 77 are arc
furnaces, 2 generate heat by arc and
resistance combined, and 35 are in
duction furnaces. There are also some
pig iron smelting furnaces, Norway and
Sweden having 2 or 3. Of the steel
furnaces, 7 are at work in England, and
a number in America, but the great ma
jority are in France and Germany.
Most of the furnaces are of small capa
city — Ito 5 tons. They are employed
chiefly on high-class steels for specia
purposes, but a fair proportion are
working on ordinary steel, such as
structural steel, castings, and railway
ties, rails, etc.
The blueness of the sky is attributed
by Lord Raleigh to the dispersal of light
by small particles, which he supposes to
be chiefly by actual -molecules of the
air, instead of dust, water vapor, etc.
He believes that Spring's theory of
absorption by chemical matter is dis
proved by the red— instead of blue— of
the setting sun.

Benjamin F. Gilbert, 91 E. Court

ache and other symptoms of kidney
compaint annoyed me greatly, and my
condition steadily grew worse in spite
of all my efforts for relief. It was all

Finally a party who had taken Doan's
Kidney Pills, advised me to try them,
and I was led to get a box at the City
Pharmacy. In three days after begin

beneficial effect, and in a little over a

at Spagnoli's drug store.THE RIDICULE PLAN
Aii imiih nt occurred at the last Utttillg trf the board <f
supervisors that the pulilir OQgbt 10 know about, although
it docs not figure M R pnrt of the record. It ibo.VS the spirit
in which wholes. me and proper advice, and COfflfog direct
from those who arc official ly authorized to give it, II received
in official circles. The rtpOft of the last grand jurv contained
some sound aiul timely rcconimendations,[sill aimed to secure
a better administration of county affairs. [Several of the sug
gestion ; were not complimentary to the supervisors, but
there can he no question that all were in line with the in
terests of the taxpayers and a sound government. Now it
is the business of the supervisors to have the grand jury re
port read before them. It should have; been received as the
voice of the sovereign people speaking in tones of command
to their servants entrusted for the moment with place and
power. Its contents ought to have been discussed with all
seriousness, and resolutions passed pledging the board to
comply with such recommendations as were aimed to bring
about reforms, the urgency of which cannot be questioned.
But the document was accorded a totally different reception.
It was made the butt of derisive joking, and this { temper
found vent in a proposition flippantly made by one the mem
bers, to the effect that the report %4 be framed, with the signa
tures of the supervisors attached thereto, and that it be
draped in heavy mourning." Of course the underlying
motive of this clumsy effort at jocularity was evidently a
desire to belittle and poke fun at the grand jury for daring
to do its sworn duty iu commenting adversely upon the ad
ministration of county affairs when, in the opinion of that
body, the circumstances demanded it. The writer was not
present when the incident occurred, but the Ledger's rep
resentative was there and noted the proceedings. To our
mind this affair takes premier rank among the deplorable
things in connection with the local government. It means
the reign of oligarchy; a contempt of the people under a free
government. It says iu effect, "we'll do as we please, and
no man uor body of men, even though dressed in official
robes, shall say us nay." Is it not about time that the voters
"sit up and take notice,'' and act in a way that will put the
quietus upon such loftiuess. There is absolutely no hope of
betterment while this " don't care" policy is allowed to pre
vail.

On Fishing Trip
A fishing party consisting of William
Hess Allen Hamrick and Perry Lcpley
spent Sunday along the Mokelumne
river, and returned with a good sup

to be fine, and the day's outing was
greatly enioyed.
A touch of rheumatism, or a twinge
of neuralgia, whatever the trouble is,
Chamberlains' liniment drives away the
pain at once and cures the complaint
quicKly. First application gives relief.
Sold by all dealers.

thanks to the pallbearers and all kind
