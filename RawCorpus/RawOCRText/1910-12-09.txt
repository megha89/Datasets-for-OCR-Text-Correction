DELUCCHI'S
TRIAL ENDED
Jury Renders Verdict of
Assault With Deadly
Weapon
The trial of John Delucchi for as
sault with a deadly weapon upon
Manuel Lopez was contiuned from Fri
day afternoon till Monday morning,
owing to Saturday being a half -holiday.
The prosecution got through with
testimony in chief on Friday and two
witnesses for the defense— W.
Deaner and J. Cotfman were examined
Friday afternoon.
JMonday morning, John Delucchi, the
defendant, was put on the stand. He
gave his version of the affair substan
tially as follows : Lopez started to
work under me on Monday morning
previous to the trouble. I was night
boss at the Original Amador mine.
Defendant on the 25th laid oft' one
shift and a half on account of his leg
being hurt. Some one told me a fellow
was hurt, and 1 went to see, and found
it was Lopez. Assisted him to the
skip and took him to the top. He
walked, part of the way to the chang
ing house, and I packed him some.
Saw nothing the matter with his leg
when he changed his clothes. Saw him
next day at the board house playing
cards. On the 27th defendant told him
on the street he was able to work.
Told him to come to mine that night.
At working time gave him candle, and
told him to go to the south stope of
500 level, and get the jigger hose, but
to leave jigger where it was. Met him
afterwards at 500 station, he had both
the jigger and hose : found he had
taken the wrong hose, one which was
too short. He said he had made a
mistake. Told him to take it back,
and get the other one; and that I
wanted men to do as they were told ;
that I did not like to be behind them
all time. Next saw Lopez on top
about 11 o'clock, when 1 went to com
pressor room to eat my supper. Lopez
came and inquired of the engineer for
the night boss. He said he would not
work any more, and gave up oil can
and monkey wrench. I said all right,
come day time and get your money.
A few minutes after he asked for his
job back again. Asked him "what you
quit for if you want your job". He re
plied that he thought he was going to
be fired. I was told by Mr Deaner to
get a gun as there were some men
who wanted to do me up. I stopped

MATTLEY LAID
TO HIS REST
Short Illness Terminates
Fatally for Well Known
Rancher
After a short illness of a few days,
John Mattley, aged 40 years, son of
David Mattley of Jackson, died at his
home on Sutter street, on Saturday
last, while suffering from pneumonia.
Mattley had been plowing on the
Mattley hill, just back of his home
for the past week, and it is supposed
that it was while engaged at this
work that he contracted the cold which
settled on ' his lungs, terminating in
lung fever, and his untimely death.
On Friday night when Mrs Mattley,
his wife, and several relatives were
conversing in their home, the hus
band, who was of a strong physique, in
a delirious spell, jumped out of bed
and took his overalls saying that he
must finish his plowing. He overcame
the kind friends who attempted to
prevent him from leaving the house,
and went out into the darkness in his
bare. feet. It required the strength of
several men to capture him and return
him to his bed. This exposure no
doubt had much to do in hastening the
end.
A wife and two sons survive the de
ceased, David, aged 20, and Roy aged
11. He is also survived by his par
ents, and four brothers, Josehp, Al
b.e.rt .Dave ) and George.
The funeral services were held on
Monday last, at St. Patrick's church,
at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
The pall bearers were: Gus Lave
rone, Virgilio Belluomini, Sam Har
ris William Brewer, Pete Plasse and
Wm. Carley.
A large concourse of relatives and
friends gathered at the house, and the
funeral cortege moved from there to
the church where mass was said. The
body was then interred in the Catholic
cemetery. Father Gleason held the
obsequies at the grave.

HIGH SCHOOL
BOARD FORMED
Educators Elect Officers,
Mo Other Business
Transacted
A meeting of the board of education
was called on Monday evening and
convened in the office of the superin
tendent of schools at 7.30 p. m.
Mrs Davis called the meeting to or
der, and superintendent Greenhalgh
read the minutes of the last meeting
and the roll call, to which Mrs Davis,
F. A. Ball, Wm. Greenhalgh, and
John A. Gordon, who was recently ap
pointed as a member of that
body, reported as present while Miss
Rabb of Sutter Creek was absent.
Mrs Davis, after stating that the ob
ject of the meeting was to organize
as a county high school board, said
that a motion was in order for the
nomination of a president of . the
board. F. A. Ball nominated John A.
Gordon, who in return begged to be
excused, because of his inability to
give the duties of the position all the
time required in doing justice to the
office.
Mr Greenhalgh then placed Mrs
Davis in nomination which was
seconded by Gordon and unanimously
voted on by the committee.
Mr Gordon then nominated F. A.
Ball as secretary of the board. Mr
Ball requested that Mr Greenhalgh be
elected to the secretaryship.
Mr Gordon explained that his reason
for nominating Mr Ball was because of
the arduous duties which the present
school superintendent had to perform.
Mr Greenhalgh moved the nomina
tions be closed and Mr Ball was then
elected as secretary of the board.
No further official businesa was pre
sented to the board, and a motion was
made to adjourn until the call of the
chair.
A delegation from Sutter Creek 'was
present at the meeting, as .well as. a
committee representing the interests
of Jackson. Each was well armed
with statistics compiled pertaining to
the high school proposition, and strong
arguments setting forth reasons why
each district should have the high
school site, as well as temporary ac
comodations for the same.
No reference, however, was broached
on this official business, and the
squall was deferred to some further
time when the board shall see fit to
call a meeting to conduct official busi
ness.
To Keep Out
Bankrupt Sales.
The board of city trustees met on
the bth instant, and passed an ordi
nance, which is published in full else
where imposing a license tax of SIOO

business men of the town. The ordi
nance goes into effect next Monday.
Oranges from Drytown
A limb with a cluster of naval
oranges, was presented to John K.
Huberty, county clerk, on Wednesday
morning last by Peter Labadie. The
fruit was raised on the latter's place,
at his ranch near Drytown. The
oranges are beautiful, large specimens
of the navel variety, and are the pro
duct of years of experiment and culti
vation on the part of Labadie, who
has quite a nice little grove under cul
tivation at his ranch.
Will Stage Another Show
The Jackson Military band will

Five Cents Per Copy.
Why Jackson Should
Have the High School.
(Communicated)
At an election held November 7,
1910, the people of Amador county de
cided they were in favor of a county
high school, and the momentous ques
tion is, where shall the high school
be located.
To the people of Amador county we
submit some facts why the city of
Jackson should be selected as the site
of this school.
Jackson is the oldest sister, social
prestige is herj. Here is located the
seat of county government. We are
an incorporated city with an area of
I,'iJ square miles and a population of
3500. Jackson is the most prosper
ous, permanent and picturesque
mountain town on the "Mother Lode."
Her mines are among the heaviest
gold producers in the state, one of
which, the Kennedy, is the deepest in
the United States. The payroll of
these mines is $60,000 per month,
which is at least $35000 greater than
any other town in the county. Jack
son need not depend alone on her
mines but in the vicinity of Jackson
are copper, marble, granite, sand
stone, timber, fine farms, orchards,
vineyards, and being the county seat
is enough to insure her to be always
the leading city of the county. We
have good hotels and banking facili
ties. Almost every business and pro
fession is represented, four churches,
twenty fraternal societies, up-to-date
business houses and residences. Her
manufacturing concerns are : machine
shops, printing offices, soda works,
gas and ice plants, macaroni and
candy factories. Our public schools
offer unsurpassed educational facili
ties. We are a city of homes under
whose parental roofs are housed 512
school children. In adjacent districts
are 261 school children, making a total
of 773 school children in the immediate
vicinity, while in our sister town
there are 248 school children and in
districts contiguous to her are 281
schorH children making a total ot 529
school children. Shall the 773 children
be made subservient to the 529 of our
neighboring town?
The taxable property of Jackson is
$1,981 007, while that of Sutter Creek
and Amador City is $1,312,021, show
ing that Jackson is assessed for
$668,986 more than the other two
towns combined.
Jackson is located in the center of
population and wealth of the county.
From Jackson comes the far greater
number of graduates who would be
likely to attend the high school.
Patrons coming to the county seat to
attend to official business could have
the pleasure of visiting their children
who are attending the high school.
Now in view of the facts as given,
and in order to have a high school
\vur hy of the name, and one that will
be a credit to our county, will you not
agree with us that the seat of our
county government is the proper place
to locate the high school.
Mr Voter, let us not lose sight of
the aim for which we are aspiring.
A high school that will meet the
hopes of the people who are welcom
ing it, and giving it their support.
It is only under such favorable con
ditions as Jackson sets forth that a
high school can claim fitness for exis
tence if it would endure as an institu
tion of the future.
A. U. O. D. Grand Lodge
For Jackson.
An effort is being made to have the
grand lodge ot the Order of Druids
held in Jackson in 1912. K. Beluzzi,
one of the prominent men of^the order
here, is working hard to that end.
Accommodations for at least 500 per
sons will be necessary, and Mr Beluzzi
has been around to private families,
hotels and boarding , houses to see if
sleeping accommodations can be had
for that many. Such an addition to
our population would no doubt stretch
our capacity in this line to the utmost,
but there is no question that that num
ber could be taken care of in a credit
able manner. The canvass ot the
matter has sufficiently settled that
fact. .The grand lodge will give an
impetus to all branches of business for
a week or more. The place of location
will be settled at the grand lodge
which meets next year, but those who
are behind the move in favor of Jack
son are collecting all necesasry data so
as to be prepared to present the case
fully and fairly when the proper time
comes.

THE LOCAL CENSUS.
By the returns of the census just given out California has
gained in pDpulation in greater ratio than any other state in
the Union during the past ten years, the increase being over
6o per cent. The figures are very gratifying for the state as
a whole, but most disappointing for the iesidents of the min
ing counties of the mother lode, which section has the unen
viable distinction of suffering a serious decline in population.
Amador county has lost more heavily, proportionately than
her sister mining counties. By the census of 1900. Amador
county had 11,116 inhabitants. By the census of 1910 the
population is given as 9086, a loss of 2030 in the ten years.
This means that we have less people by nearly one-fifth than
we had ten years ago. At the same ratio, the county would
become depopulated in fifty years. On an average we have
lost 203 persons each year during the past decade. A falling
off was expected, because it was indicated by a reduced regis
tration of voters and a diminishing school census, j Still such
an alarming outflow of population as. that revealed by the
census was unlooked for. Our neighboring counties are in
the same category. Calaveras has lost 2029 in the same
period, El Dorado 1494, and Tuolumne 1140. Nevada, the
banner quartz mining county, has been hit in the same way
with a loss of 2834. •
It is remarkable that while California has been reaping a
steady harvest of immigrants at the rate of over 70,000 per
year, these foothill regions—unsurpassed in natural weath
and for home-making purposes — should lag behind so badly.
There is a cause for it, probably a combination of causes.
As far as Amador is concerned the anomaly is presented of
a steadily increasing assessment roll and a substantial in
crease of gold output, keeping step to the march of depopu
lation. In other words, we have thrived in spite of our loss
—grown richer instead of poorer by the depletion of our
ranks. Though comparatively few in numbers, we are pros
perous.
The census returns show the value of persistent advertis
ing in attracting population. Southern California owes its
wonderful growth to the fact that it has never missed an op
portunity to sound its own praises in the ears of the home
seeker. The "knocker" is not much in evidence in the
south land. And yet they cannot and do not deny that the
northern portion of the state is far ahead of- the south in all
that appeals to the one seekiug a desirable home place. But
the booster spirit has had full swing in the country of lesser
natural advantages, and has made it what it is to-day. The
advertising business has been a totally neglected science as
far as Amador county is concerned. The stranger has been
left to find us out in his wanderings, instead of being invited
and guided by an extended hand. Being off the usual path
of travel, the intending settler finds a home elsewhere, ignor
ant of everything that this foothill country has to offer.
The mining industry has not contrtbuted to this outflow
'of population. We are taking out as much gold as we ever
did from quartz mining, and the future in that line is very
bright. But our farmers have declined. Many have sold
out to stockmen, and thousands of acres formerly occupied
by small farmers are now surrendered to stock-raising.
These foothill lands have been found peculiarly adapted to
cattle, and the stockmen have steadily increased their hold
ings at the expense of the actual tillers of the soil. The
process of cutting up big land holdings to accommodate the
demand for small farms, so prominent a feature of other
parts of the state, has been reversed here; we have been
breaking up the farms to accommodate the increasiug herds
of the stockmen. How to create a tendency the other way is
the problem that faces the foothill sections.
There are ten school districts within a rad'.us of
half a dozen miles of the county seat. This territory contains
about one half the school census children of the county, ex
clusive of the existing lone high school district. From the
viewpoint of "the greater good to the greater number," it has
far superior claims for high school facilities than any other
district, and equal to all other districts combined; It cannot
be expected that this population will submit to a county high
school located beyond reaching distance.

Changes of temperature and habitat
are found by Prof. Henri Douville, of

great and permanent fall of tempera

Reptiles, and favored the development
of animals, which are better organized

burrowers, like the mole; and Hying
creatures, like the bats. . Of the Her
bivora, some, like the rhinoceros,
were adapted for resistance by weight
and armor: others, line the horse and
the antelope, by their swiftness. One
group, the Primates, including the
apes and finally man, sought refuge in
the trees. Then came the temporary
chilling of the region of some of the
apes by the Glacial Epoch at the close
to the Pliocene period, and the tropical
forest became so stunted as no longer
to support large tree-dwellers. Forced
to walk, the skeleton of the animals,
brain and intelligence, grew, and man
was born.
The curious gas lamp of a German
engineer is given extra draft by
means of an electric current generated
by the heated waste gases from the
lamp itself. A thermo-battery of
nickel, copper and aluminum is placed
over the lamp, and feeds a small
electric motor that drives a fan draw
ing air into the flame. The battery
can endure a temperature of 12 deg.
C, which is about twice that to which
it is exposed.
A river flowing up stream w/s | the
strange phenomenon witnessed in Up
per Dahomey by a French geographer
during 15 days of last May. The slope
of the bed is slight, the nver is dry
several months in the year, and the
rainy season begins in the down
stream country, so that the water
runs both ways until the channel is
filled.
It appears, that the noisiness of
the . modern high-speed machi
nery may be avoided by the use of
cloth as a material for working parts
of the machines. In a paper lately
read in New York to the National
Machine Tool Builders' Association,
John Riddell mentioned experience at
Schenectady with gears and pinions
made from high-grade muslin, which
had been applied to varied uses, and
had proven not only ■ almost noiseless
but very strong. A pinion of muslin
that had been used two years on a
boiler maker's punch and shear, both
reduced the noise and remedied trouble
from the breaking of gears. On two
10-foot planing machines, operated by
electric motors and compressed air
clutches, muslin intermediate pinions
were applied for ; the reverse motion,
and were found silent and durable in a
place where bronze, rawhide and other
materials lasted not more than thren
or four weeks, and steel made an in
tolerable noise. In special tests the
cloth pinions resisted without injury
shocks so severe as to break nearly
half of the teeth in a gun-iron pinion.
This special dietary was arranged by
the medical officer of the workhouse,at
Keigley, Yorkshire, to reduce the
weight of two very heavy men. For
breakfast, porridge, skim milk, stewed
fruit, and watercress in season;
dinner, bread, lean meat or fish, and
vegetables; supper, bread, tea, stewed
fruit, watercress and lettuce. Not
more than 20 ounces of solid food was
allowed on week days, and 22 ounces
on Sunday. The patients, beween 60
and 70 years of age, strictly adhered
to the diet prescribed, and between
May and Christmas, 1909, their
weights fell from 256 to 182 pounds
and 248 to 189 pounds. Their health
and bodilyjcondition have so improved
that they are able to walk about,
leaving the chairs to which they had
been confined for years.
Metals combining lightness and
strength are in demand for aeroplanes
and other purposes. Many attempt*
have been made to strengthen mfig>
neaium without adding much to its
weight, as ita specific gravity is only
1.7, while that of aluminum is 2.6,
and that of iron i s 7.8. An alloy
with zinc, containing as much as 90
to 96 per cent of magnesium, is the
subject of a recent French patent.
The even lighter calcium, specific
gravity 1.68, has been tried by the
patentee, and he claims useful alloys
with zinc, copper or caluimnum, or
all three mixed.
Some interesting results of scientific
forestry have been collected by D. E.
Hutchins in a report on a plaM to re
forest Cyprus. The German forests,
covering about 35,000.000 acres, yield
$110,000,000 a year, and the rapid in
crease of area and productiveness jus
tifies the hope that the present im-
portaUon of $80,000,000 of timber Into
Germany will soon be unnecessary.
The spruce forest of the Erzgebirge
mountains, supplying 2,128 cubic feet
per acre from growing stock, seems
to lead in average yield. This land is
worth not more than $1.00 an acre for
ordinary farming or pasturage, but
gives a net annual profit of about
$9.00 an acre from the judicious thin
ning out of the timber. In Prance,
the coniferous forest of Besancon
gives a net income of about $16.00 an
acre. A young forest of 1950 acres on
Mount Ventoux in Provence, planted
botween 1863 and 1878. is not only al
ready profitable, yielding a return of
about 14,000 a year, but has quite
transformed the neighboring country.
Springs have reappeared, with restored
fertility, and a remarkable increase
in the value of the lowlands.
A curious insect visitation was late
ly recorded by a London health officer.
A private house became so infested
with swarms of a small beetle as to
be uninhabitable, and after sulphur
dioxide fumigation with only partial
success in destroying the pest, the
premises were vacated until they could
be thoroughly cleansed. A consign
ment of turmeric at a neighboring
warehouse was the breeding place cf
the insects. The turmeric- -about 15
tons in 227 bags— had been imported
from Bombay, and was found to be
honeycombed by maggots. The beetles
were identified as Lasioderma Serri
ccrne. Tab., often known as the
"cigar" or "cigarette" beetle, from
injury caused to tobacco products.
Zinc instead of cement has been in
joints of a new concrete bridge near
Lyons, France. Molten zinc at 800
deg. F. was understood to cause no
fracture of dry stones, and it was used
in one-eighth inch thickness to join the
stones of two elliptical arches. The
increase in cost was about 82.50 per
square foot of the bridge's horizontal
• The Mother Lode.
Men who are well posted in mining
affairs are promising great activity
along the muther lode in the counties
tributary to Stockton and the future
looks encouraging for greater develop
ment throughout the mining region
which has made California famous for
more than half a century. When
speculators were rushing into the oil
fields in the belief that fortunes
awaited the inrushers, capital was
taken from the surer fields of quartz
mining and the leading counties east
of Stockton suffered for want of means
to develop the known good properties
awaiting men of means to handle
them. Now that the oil business has
been so generally absorbed by great
cornbi nations of capital, men of
smaller fortunes are again looking to
the mother lode and things are bright
er for the counties of the southern
mines belt.
Deep mining along t.he lode is pro
fitable and men who know the fields
look for a boom in the sections where
deep shafts have uncovered paying
veins in Amador and deep works in
the Keystone and Eureka properties,
among others, have shown that the
great quartz fissures are dividend pro
ducers when their ores have been
reached on levels 2000 and more feet
from the surface and such mining is
no longer experimental. The South
Eureka, in Amador county, located be
tween the famous Eureku and Ken
nedy properties, is to-day one of the
best paying properties in the state and
the development was made within the
past year by sinking deeper on the
vein. Following the mother lode
southward it has been found that deep
mining pays in Calaveras, Tuolumne
and Mariposa counties, and everybody
knows the wonderful success of the
deep mines of Nevada county where
the vein matter bas been dug into at
a depth of close to a mile from the
surface.
All along the great quartz zone
which made California famous us a
gold producer are many promising pro
perties only awaiting plucky men with
means sufficient to get shafts down to
2000 or 3000 feet. Once capital is
turned from the risky oil belt to the
surer field of the mother lode and
California's gold story will be larger
than in the old days for the gold is in
the rock in almost unlimited quanti
ties and modern science recovers all of
it-Stockton Independent.

Word was received .here yesterday
morning that Charles Erickson died in
San Francisco on Wednesday night,
after being operated upon for appen
dicitis. Deceased was taken suddenly
ill, and at one of the city hospitals the
attending physicians performed the
operation, the case being deemed criti
cal. He died shortly afterward.
Deceased was 52 years of age. He was
largely interested in Amador county
interests. He was president and prin
cipal owner of the Amador Central
railroad, holding four-fitfhs of the
stock. ' He was also interested in the
Amador Lumber Company, owning
large tracts of timber land in the
eastern portion of the county, and to
tap which the project of extending the
Amador Central is now under way.
The death of this capitalist' \a deeply
deplored It may delay the railroad
extension temporarily. Mr Edward

terests of the railroad extension and
other matters, was ,in Jackson when
he received the startling news of his
demise. He left him only a week ago
in San Francisco, at which time he
seemed in his usual robust health.

DELUCCHI'S,
TRIAL ENDED
Continue.! from I'ape 1
at the Amador hotel. On the 29th I
got up about quarter after 4 in the
afternoon. Crossed the creek from
the rear of the hotel to go to the mine
to see the foreman, who had gone
home. Came back to town to go to
hotel. Saw Lupez on the hotel porch
in front of butcher shop. He said,
"Come over to the end of the bridge,
I want to talk to you." I told him to
say what he wanted right there. He
"aid he wanted to fight. I said I did
not want to fight, that I did not make
my living by prize fighting. Lopez
then tried to strike me, but 1 dodged
my head. He pushed me off the porch
out to the street. When 1 got up I
caught hold of the porch post. Lopez
tried to grab mn by tho leg, and 1
kicked at him. Coffman came out
from the hotel. Lopez pulled him
down again I got up und tried to go to
hotel, and Lopez hit mo in the back as
J was going to hotel with Coffman.
Heard some one say. "Kill the Dago
." Told Coffman to call police
man. Coffman gave me a pistol. 1
went outside, as I had to go to the
mine. Took pistol to scatter or scare
them. Did not try to shoot, or strike
with it. As I went out I had the pis
tol behind me, holding it with both
hands. As I passed into the street,
Lopez started toward me, ttnd when
five or six feet apart, I turned the pis
tol in front, holding it down with both
hands, lam left handed. He grabbed
the pistol, and finally got it away from
me. Some one struck me in face and
back. There was a', hunch of men
there, and no one tried t:> help me,
but tried to lick me. Coffman came to
him and the fight ended. Never told
Lopez wanted $10 for giving him a
job. Lopez said he would give $10 for
a job. I told him to keep his money.
■ Several minor witnesses testified,
contradicting the complaining witness
on some immaterial points, showing
that the first scuffle occurred on the
porch i if the hotel, also that Lopez
was in the hotel on that day inquiring
for defendant, and likewise at the
mine.-
The ca?e was given to the jury
Tuesday afternoon. The defense was
willing to submit the case without
argument, but this was not accepted
by the prosecution. The arguments,
however, were brief. After a short
deliberation the jury returned a ver
dict of guilty for assault with a dead
ly weapon.
On Wednesday the defendant was
before the court for sentence, bat at
the request of defendant's counsel the
matter was continued until Saturday
next, so as to enable counsel to .pre
pare for a motion for a new trial. The
penalty for the offense of which De
lucctu is convicted is from twoyears in
state prison to a brief term in the
county jail or a fine.

Big Bar Bridge.
The grand jury of Calaveras county
reported .as follows concerning the Big
Bar bridge case : •
The district attorney brought to our
attention ttie delay in the entering of
the findings in the Big Bar bridge, and
Bret Harte Jiigh school cants, and it
appearing to the satisfaction of this
body that unnecessary time is being
consumed in these cases and that the
present district attorney may have no
opportunity to take an appeal before
his term of office expires, we hereby
recommend that the board of super

on the entry of judgment in these
cases, and that the necessary steps to
appeal the same to the supreme court
so that the interests of the county may
be conserved and a authoritative de

The Lincoln shaft is now down

caved full, but bears evidence of clear

are nearly in place. The water has
chopped off about one-half which In

Wildman-Mahoney have been drained.
When the shaft clears it is thought the
water "can be taken out at the rate of
20 to 30 feet per day. High grade ore
was discovered in the shaft a few days

ore probably fell in from the hanging,

A Far Look.
Three, visitors traveling In the IMe of
Wnn thought they would visit Snaefel),
the king of Manx mountains. When
walking up toward the mountain they
espied nn old shepherd coming toward
thorn. They thought they would take
n rise out of him, so one accosted him,
laying:
"They tell me, old ninn, you can nee
England, Scotland, Ireland and even
ns fur ns America from the top of this
mountain."
"Oh, yea!" said the old mau. "If you
will come with me I will show you
much fnrther than America."
So, chuckling to themselves, they de
cided to follow him. After trudging
for about half an hour up the moun
tain side In a boiling sun they began
to feel Pttther fugged* and kept asking
the shepherd how much farther they
had to go.
He kept urging them on a little far
iicr until at Inst the three visitors lay
down on the grass and Bald they would
go no farther for any sight.
"Now," snid the old man, "if you will
Hit here long enough you will see the
moon."
Buried on His Horse.
Lord Dacre, who died fighting for the
Lancastrians nt Towton, England, In
1101, directed that if he were killed In
the battle his favorite war horse sumiUl
he hurled in tho same grave with him.
According to his wishes, when his In
terment took place In Saxon church
yard after the battle a tremendous
grave was dug, and In It the warrior
was burled, seated upright on his
horse. For centuries reflections were
cast upon the accuracy of this tradi
tion, but some years ago while exca
vations were being made close by the
reputed burial place of Lord Dacre the
pick of a digger struck Into a great
bone, and upon further search being
made the skull of a big horse was
brought to tho surface. As this was
found almost at the very spot under
which the body of Lord Dacre was
said to He it was accepted as confirma
tion of the tradition, particularly as the
skull was found to be standing verti
cally in the soil. The skull was re
placed carefully in its original position
and the excavation filled up.

Queer Creatures.
There are microscopic creatures |
which live in roof gutters aud on the |
bark of trees nnd are known as water
bears and wheel anlmalculae. If al
lowed to dry up under tho microscope
they can bo seen to shrivel into shape
less masses, which may be kept for
years uninjured in. the dried state. On
being placed, after this long interval, ;
in water they gradually plump up, re
sume their proper shape and move
about lv search of food just as if noth
ing had happened. Much the same is
trne for the minute worms which,
from the substances In which they
live, are known as paste and vinegar
eels. Well known is the famous case
of the desert snail which, retracted
into its shell, was fastened to a. tab
let in the British museum and show
ed no sign of life for soveu years.

Saluting With tho Hat.
lief ore the invention of wig* the hat
was rarely removed except to ,s:iiute
others, especially royal personages. It
was worn at table when ladies or per
sons of rank were present. Except
when saluting royalty it was the? cus
tom merely to raise the baud to the
hat somewhat after the manner of a
military salute. When it became tho
mode to wear a profusion of false hair
tho hat was less needed as a protec
tion for the head and was carried, un
iler tho arm.
Diplomatic.
The late Lord Savile used to say
that high diplomatists had always to
be on their guard against iutrlguing
women, mainly Russian agents, who
would use any vile to extract infor
mation. During the Itusso-Turkisli
war, when Europe was always on the
verge of a crisis and Russian states
men were most anxious to know what
England would do under given circum
stances, a lady came up to him sud
denly at a ball and said:
"I hear that the Russians have made
a forced inarch and entered Constanti
nople," hoping, no doubt, that he
would be surprised into some Indis
creet expression.
He merely replied:
"Indeed! And I suppose the sultan
has conferred on them the order of
the Turkish batb!"
The lady continued gravely:
"And they say in Paris that if Eng
land does not interfere the eastern
question is settled in favor of Russia."
"And that." replied his excellency,
"is, I suppose, the new Judgment of
Paris."
Strango Hiding Place.
False teetb are occasionally used for
secretive purposes. An eccentric old

Temples of 8l»m.

In Slam are visited by the king or hl.«
deputies, bearing the phra kathin (yel
low robes), in conformity with an an
cient custom by which the priests were
made to seek their apparel for the en
sulng year. During the lifetime of
liuddlm monks nnd prlesta were sent
out to beg for old castoff garments,
which were nfterward dyed yellow nnd
patched torother to form the required
robes. ThM ancient mendicant cus
tom gradually gave place to the pres
ent one of making the garments from
n new cloth of n bright canary yellow,
provided by Joint contributions of
king, princes, nobles and commoners.
When the king goes In the royal throne
barge to present the robes In person
he docs no with great pomp and cere
mony. Tho priestly garments, folded
lv bundles, nre tarried to tho door of
tho temple to await the appearance of
his majesty nnd his suit. The king
on arriving takes n priestly robe nnd
places it on n decorated altar. The
I'hlcf priest, then lays his hands on the
garment and chants an acknowledg
ment.—-Wide World Magazine.
Won by His Wit.
A story is told of an English clergy
tian who owed his appointment to a
rich living to n lucky puu. He was
furor to the »;ou of n nobleman and
hr.d not long taken orders when he
attended the funeral of the rector of
the parish in which the nobleman's
seat was situated. . The father of his
pupil was patron of the living and
was also present at the funeral of
tho deceased rector. There was a
young clergyman present also whose
grief wan so demonstrative that tho
noliJo patron was much affected by tho
sight and a^Ued if the young man was
a son of the deceased gentleman.
"Oh, dear, no, my lord— no relation
at all." said the tutor.
"No relation:" exclaimed the noble
man in a surprised tone.
"None, my lord. Ho is the curate,
and I think he is not weeping for the
dead, but for the living."

n wit and a cynic himself, was so de

The first look through a great tele

soons sees that the flat appearance
which the heavens present to the
naked eye is replaced by a curious con

-Mr. Blight's attention to the high cost
of plovers' eggs that year.
" 'Even though.' she said, 'they have
to be shipped from England, I don't
see why their price should have nearly
doubled, do you?'
" 'Well— er— not exactly,' murmured

Just Like Eve's Apple.
A fruit supposed to bear the mark of
Eve's teeth is one of the many botan
ical curiosities of Ceylon. The tree on
■which it grows is known by the sig
nificant name of "the forbidden fruit,"
or "Eve's apple tree." The blossom
has a very pleasant scent but the real
ty remarkable feature of the tree, the
one to which It owes its name, is the
fruit It is beautiful and bangs from
the tree In a peculiar manner. Orange
on the outside and deep crimson with
in, each fruit has the appearance of
having had a piece bitten out of it.
This fact, together with its poisonous
quality, led the Mohammedans to rep
resent It as the forbidden fruit of the
garden of Eden and to warn men
against its noxious properties. The
mark upon the fruit is attributed to
Eve. Why the bite of Adam did not
also leave its mark Is not known, but
as only one piece seems to be missing
Its loss is ascribed to the. woman.

Remarkable Case Cured
After combating with death for
more than four weeks, Dr. Blake
Franklin succeeded in restoring the 11
month old daughter of John Glavich.
of Broadway, to her normal health.
The case is one of exceptional
merit, and required many hours of the
physician's time at the bedside of his
patient, studying the case.
The infant was suffering from spinal
meningitis, and brontho phneumonia,
and for days at a time would lay un
conscious. At periods the child's limbs
would become paralyzed, yet with all,
at the present time, the baby can
chatter, smile and struggle, and has
full control over its limbs.
Dr. Franklin recently located in our
city, and has since his short time here
built up a very desirable practice.

Animals in Cold Weather
The wild animal that minds cold the
least i 3 undoubtedly the rabbit. In
deed, it is said that the rabbit is, of
all warm-blooded creatures, the most
capable of withstanding very low tem
peratures. A rabbit which had got in
to a block of ice was imprisoned there
twelve hours. When freedom was
finally secured, it began almost in
stantly to feed.
Hares, too, can stand a lot of cold
so long as they can get food. The Al
pine hare, which is found in Cumber
land and Scotland, never seems incon
venienced by the worst frosts. The
Arctic fox is another creature which
no degree of cold seems to bother. It
is one of the very few animals of the
Arctic region which does not.hiber
nate.
Of domestic animals, sheep come
first as cold resisters. In a great
blizzard which swept England in 1891,
sheep were dug out of the drifts that
had been buried twenty four days.
They were still alive. Next to sheep
in cold weather hardiness comes goats
and then pigs.
Among the birds, thrushes and
blackbirds seem able to endure less
cold than the finch tribe* of which the
house sparrow is the commonest type.
The hedge sparrow appears, of all
birds, to be the most affected by cold
weather. '
Pesch enjoys cold weather and
freezes, comfortably making their
winter homes in lakes that are frozen
practically solid.
Shall women vote.
If they did. millions would vote Dr.
King's New Life Pills the true remedy
for women. For banishing dull, fagged
feelings, backache or headache, consti
pation, dispelling colds, imparting ap
petite and toning up the system, they
are unequaled. Easy, safe. sure. 25c

The plant of the California Door
Company nt Caldor has closed down
for the season, after one of the most
successful lumbering seasons in its
history. Many other workmen came
to Plncerville last Saturday evening,
and remained over until Monday
morning before going out to the val
ley or to the" southern part of the
state for the winter. A few of them
will spend the winter in Placerville.—

This journal desires to let tho, vyorld
know what is being done in El Dorado
county in the way of permanent de
velopment, and with this end in view
ask our readers to let us know what
they are doing. Last year more ,than
50,000 new fruit trees were planted in
the county, and we believe that there
will be twice as many set out this
year. J. H. Randolph has already or
dered 11,000 pear, prune and plum
trees from the Penryn nursery £ for
friends, and Charles Ray burn has or
dered 12,500 pear and 1000 apple trees
for himself and neighbors. This is a
good start for so early in the season. —
Nugget.
The district attorney of Yuba county
has submitted an opinion to the board
of supervisors of that county in which
he says members of the board are not
entitled to mileage. He bases his
opinon on section 4270 of the political
code, amended March 25 1910, which
went into effect 60 days thereafter. If
this is good law our district attorney
will have a case in his hands of re
covering back mileage paid our super
visors. It seems strange that this law
has not been heard of before and com
mented upon by some of our astute
gentlemen of the press. The super
visors get such a "munificent sajary' 1
—$60 a month and found on the wrong
side of many questions— that it hardly
seems right they should be deprived of
mileage. — Record.

Angelo Noce, who has been spend
ing several weeks in Jackson, his
former home, among relatives and
friends, has presented several of his
old friends with a book, of which he is
the author entitled, "Columbus
day in Colorado." Mr Noce was elec
ted as a member of the Colorado as
sembly and being a native of Genoa,
Italy, took a great interest in celebra
tion of Columbus day as a state and
national holiday. He introduced a bill
to that effect, and carried it, and his
book which has just beei issued fully
explains the entire proceedng re
quired in having the project become a
state law.
San Francisco
Sun Forced Out
Hopes of reviving the San Francisco
Sun, the the democratic mouthpiece
of the boast, are held out by state
senator A. Caminetti, but the outlook
is as gloomy as ever from the financial
phase of the affair.
The crash came last week, when the
employees refused to go on duty, ow
ing to the fact that no money could be
secured to pay arreareil salaries.
The advertising end of the business
was poorly patronized, and this is
really the life of any city paper.
A hurried call was sent to Caminet
ti, urging him to come to the city im
mediately. Hoping against fate that
some means might be discovered
whereby the end could be etaved off.
The president of the local typographic
al union, however, refused all com
promises, and at a specified hour tne
entire force of men walked out, and
the state senator arrived just a little
to late to see the last act of the tra
gedy.
Caminetti certainly did his share of
the labor both in helping organize
the paper and in boosting it after its
issue. He secured more than 60 paid
up subscriptions for the paper only
last week, in this city.

Wants to Help Someone.
For thirty years J. F. Boyer, of
Fertile, Mo., needed help and couldn't
find it. That's why he wants to help
some one now. Suffering so long him
self he feels for all distress, from
backache, nervousness, loss of appe
tite, lassitude and kidney disorders.
He shows that electric bitters works
wonders , for such troubles. "Five
bottles," he writes, "wholly cured me
and now lam well aM hearty." It's
also positively guaranteed for liver
trouble, dyspepsia, blood disorders,
female complaints and malaria. Try
them. 50c at Spagnoli 's drug store.
