Summarizing the progress that has
been mada in electro-culture, 13.
Tolksdort, v German, finds it fairly
well proven that electricity is
essential to tbe growth of vegetation,
although tbe important part played
is not yet understood. Prof. Leui
strom has found that plants soon died
under a wire cage, which excluded
atmospheric eleetricicy, while freely
admitting air, beat and light. In
Spitzbergen and Finnish Lapland
large crops are always connected with
tbe early appearance of the northern
lights; and in tbe experiments that
have been made— so far on a small
Scale— tbe yield of many plants has
been increased by an artificial supply
of electricity and water. It is sup
posed that electricity stimulates the 1
sap exchange of plants, while Lem
atrom has shown that it greatly
magnifies capillary power, thus pro
bably enabling the plauts to take in
more food from the ground.
To test uur perception of hues, Dr.
E-ldridge Green nas devised a special
instrument, which measure* exactly
tbe largest area of tbe bpectrnm that
se'eois to have one shade of color.
Hue perception proves to be gener
ally most accurate in the yellow
region, though sometimes Id tbe blue,
with a gradual diminution toward tbe
center and ends of the sppotrum, led
being least rt>adily separated. l'be
results accord with Dr. Green's
theory that, color preceptiou rests iv
a special brain center, whosu in
creased development adds to Ibe
number of colors we see.
Paper or wood-pulp has been used
tor wheels rails, cannons, paving
bricks, water pipes telegtaph poles,
Jauterus, leather, textile fabrics,
coflius, barrels, milk bottles, straw
bats, spouges, thread, porcelain,
bullets, shues, building hoards,
paint, entire bouses, and even stoves
that stood lire well.
Tbe idea that there is no natural
death is fascinating learned bio'egists.
In the loivest organisms, those of a
single cell, the individual is repro
duced by splitting iuto two carts,
each of which becomes a new living
body, and tbe distinguished El if
Metcbnikoff has ventured the view
that tbis ionn of life is immortal.
Death comes only by accident.
Going further, Naegeli, a German
botanist, decides that tbere is no
natural death in the plant world, and
that trees living thousands of years
are destroyed at last by catastrophe
or some external action. Pi of. Loeb
sees no certain evidence of natural
death, although the cessation of life
in certain eggs of the sea-hedgehog a
tew hours after being discbarged^may
be sucb. MetcbuikotT rejects this
possible exception as accidental
death, resulting from a kind of
starvation, and agrees that natuial
death is unproven. The so-called
deaths from old age, gentle and pain : ,
less, prove to be violent, the action
of disease microbes being revealed by
lesions of tbe internal organs.
Mysterious poisonings that occur
occasionally in- farm stock have been
traced to the development of prussic
acid in fodder plants. Dr. J. \V.
Leather, in India, has found that
green jowari (Andropogum Sorghum ).
flax, tbe Kungoon and certain other
beans, and the tapioca plant contain
glucosides that produce prussic acid
when acted upon by a particular
enzyme, and that this ferment be
comes active only under rare con
ditions, when tbe ordinarily whole
some plants become suddenly poisou
ous. Young jownri that had proven
fatal to cattle showed 1.25 grains of
prussic acid to tbe pound of green
fodder.
A new alloy, which serves electri
ciaus as a substitute for platinum,
consists of 16,' i ounces of silver, 4U
pounds of nickel, »•;. ounce of bis
muth, aud 53 pennyweights of gold.
The cost is about one-thiitieth of
that of platinum.

The late German fishery experi
uieuts promised quite revolutionary
results. l'be tests exteudiug over
several montbs, have shown that
deep-sea fishes may be' acclimatized
in fresh water, aud may be made to
live and breed in our rivers. Whit
ing, sole, herring, flounders and other
salt water fish were first placed in a
pond of salt water. Fresh water was
then added gradually until the salt
was all carried away, but the fish
continued healthy and active, witli
no apparent change. The effect upon
habits and general characteristics can
be told ouly after the lapse of con
siderable time. The extensive intro
duction of deeo sea fish into pouds
and rivers is next in order, and with
supplies near at hand in interior
localities, the fishery industry is ex
pected to be transformed within a tew
years.

Seven Causes for Divorce.
Tho national divorce congress, which
began its sessions at Philadelphia re-
I'eutly, with tbe object of initiating a
universal divorce law, bad a member
ship cf 120 delegates from nearly every
state. Seven causes of divorce to be
incorporated in the law were agreed
upon— adultery, bigamy, conviction
und sentence tor crime followed by
continuous imprisonment for at least
two years, extreme oruelty, such as to
endanger life or health, habitual
drunkenness for two years, and wilful
desertion tor tbe same length of time.
On tbe question of age tbere was much
discussion. Several men advocated
the ages of 21 and 18, respectively, for
for men and women, but tbis was op
posed by two wnmeu delegates, who
thought the age of matrimonial con
seut should be fixed at 13 and 10.

Life In Other Worlds.
Dr. A. Kirscbmaun, professor of
philosophy in the university of Tor
onto,in a pamphlet just issued, denies
tbe impossibility of life in othei
worlds, which position has been takeu
by do 1833 notable a scientist than
Alfred Kussell Wallace in bis recent
book on " Man's Place in the Uni
verse." Dr. Krischmann insists that
there is no limit to the relativity of
magnitudes, and maintains the possi
bility of living beings so large that
evety molecule a! their bodies is as
great as our solar system, or so stuall
that countless hosts may dwell to
gether on one of our own molecules.
He even suggests that the whole gal
actic system may be one cell of an
immense organism, lie also asserts
tbe infinity of physical condition as
another argument in favor of life in
other worlds. For every change in
temperature, iu gravity or iv chemical
composition, there may be a specially
adapted organism. Speaking physi
cally, he declares tbere is no such
thing as cold. For instance, if tbe
zero puint of tbe sense of temperature
of tbe residents of Jupiter should be
shifted a few degrees, be thinks they
would enjoy a walk on the red-hot
surface of that planet as much as we
do on tbe grean grass. In general, be
finds that the ordinary notions of
temperature are vague and mislead
ing, lie does not even admit that life
is dependent on the presence of car
bon, nitiogeu and water, Finally be
says it is a matter of belief, tut not
of knowledge, that we are a part of
tbis world. All that we can say is
that the world is a part of us and of
our consciousness.

Life Like a Game of Cards.
You know this life ia like a game of
oatds,
That each man tries to learn ;
Eacb shuffles, cuts aud deals the pack
And each a trnmp doth turn.
Some turn a higb card to the top,
While others turn a low;
Some bold a hand Hushed with trumps
While others none can show.
Wben hearts are trumps we play for
love,
And pleasure decks tbe hour;
No thought of sorrow checks our joy,
In pleasant rosy bower.
Wben diamonds chanoe to crown the
pack,
Its then men stake their gold ;
Large sums are otten lost and won
tiy gamblers, young and old.
When olubs are tramps, look out lor
war,
On ocean or on land ;
For horrid deeds are often done
When clubs are in tbe hand.
The 'last game of all is when the
spade
Is turned by the hand of time;
its time that finishes up the game
In every land and clime.
No matter how much a mau may
make,
Or bow much a man may save,
You'll Hud the spade turns up at last,
And digs tbe gambler's grave. '
MINERAL PRODUGTS
OF CALIFORNIA.
State mineralogist, Lewis E. Au
bury, has issued from tbe State Min
ing Bureau a tabulated sheet showing
tbe output in -amounts, values and
by counties of tbe mineral products
of California, tor tbe year 1905. This
appears somewhat later than usual as
the records of many sompanies were
destroyed in the great fire, and it
took a longer time to get corrected
addresses and obtain the desired in
formation.

Ibe total yield of metallic sub
stances, including gold And silver,
was for the year, 123,523,984 and in
these are also popper, quioksilver,
chrome, lead, pyrites, platinum and
tungsten. TbU is tbe first year the
latter substance has been produced
in California.
The value of non-metallic sub
stances was 82,145,930 including
borax, salt, soda, mineral waters,
asbestos, coal, Fuller's eartb, gyp
sum, infusorial eartb, litbia mien.
magnesite, mineral paint and gems.
Tbe total value of hydrocarbons and
natural gas was 19,456,025. The
hydrocarbons include asphalt, bitumi
nous rock, natural gas and petroleum,
lv 19U4 the product of petroleum iv
the state was 29,736,003 barrels, worth
18,317,800. I'he increase in output
t for the year is thus shown to be 4,
1539,698 barrels and in value 9690,011.
in structural materials, the total
value fcr the year was $7,943,288, an
increase over 1904 of 9668,442. These
materials include lime and limestone,
macadam, glass, sand, marble, gran
ite, sandstone, paving blocks, rubble,
slate, soapstone, brick and pottery
day, and cement. to the latter sub
stance the increase in the output for
the year amounted to U96.015 barrels,
the number made in 1905 being 1,296,-
553 bairels.
The relative value of the principal
mineral substanoea of the state, as
shown by the tables is as follows:
Ist, gold; 2nd, petroleum ; 3d, copper;
■Ith, cement; stb, borax; 6tb, maca
dam; 7th, quicksilver; Bth, rubble.
While gold Is still the leading min
ing product, its yield no longer puts
the greatest gold-producing oounty in
tb" first place. The petroleum of
Kern county and the copper of Shasta
give them precedence. Uold is more
widely distributed than any other
substance thus far mined in Cali
fornia; 34 counties out of the 57 in
the state showing a gold yield in 1905,
and it is known to exist in several
others. Nevada oounty produces
more gold than any other in the state,
its output for 1905 haviug been 93,
179,715 gold alone, tiuttte county,
with its numeroDS dredgers, cornea
next. Kern county is now the largest
mineral producer in the state; its
output of ten substances bringing its
total value last year up to 11,912,095.
Its petroleum alone was valued at 93,
174,96(5, which was not quite up to
Nevada oounty gold. Shasta county
falls into third place for last year,
instead of being first as it has been
tor several years, its copper produc
tion having fallen otf materially,
mainly on account of tbe cessation
of smelting operations at Keswick
by tbe Mountain Copper Company.
Shasta's entire output for all minerals
last year nas 92,579,014.
Tbe following shows the output of
tbe respective counties for 1905, as
arranged by the state mineralogist.
lie explains, however, that certain
substances have to be placed in the
"uuapportioned" column, so as to
conceal tbe identity of single mines
in certain counties. For this reason
it is necessary to put under this
heading, borax, soda, coal, Portland
cement, and a few other substances
formerly'credited to certain counties.
If credited to the exact county, where
there is only a single operator, pri
vate business wuula be made public.
Under these circumstances, the figures
of values of output in some counties
do not actually represent their re
lative rank, as some of the products
may be placed under "uuappor
tioned." I'he total value of such
substances appears in the main table,
but not in tbu table of counties. Out

The best treatment for indigestion
and troubles of the stumacb is to
rest the stomach. It can be rested by
starvation or by the use of a good
digestant which will digest the food
eaten, thus taking the work otf the
stomach. At the proper temperature^
a single teaspoonful of Kodol will
wholly digest 3,000 grains of food.
It relieves the present annoyance,
puts the stomaoh in shape to satis
factorily pefrorrn its functions.
Good for indigestion, sour stomach,

SAN FRANCISCO LETTER.
San Francisco, Nuvember 21, 1906.—
Owing to the fact that wide publicity
has been given to charges that a
million dollais of the relief fund
contributed to San Franoiscohas been
diverted or stolen, and owing to the
further fact that those who have sent
money to San Francisco are entitled
to a correct statement of conditions',
tbe California promotion committee
has sent oat the following statement :
More than six million dollars con
tributed to San Francisco came in
small sums, ranging from ten cents
up to thousands of dollars. These
sums came by mail and express, in
all forms, from postage stamps and
currency to money orders and bank
drafts. Of the entire amount sent
two sums only went astray. One
package of currency containing one
thousand and eighty-five dollars and
Ofty cents from Searchlight, Nevada,
senf through the Bank and Trust
Company of Los Angeles, by express,
and the other a package of two hun
dred dollars sent by mail from Balti
more.
The paokage of Searchlight money
was traced only as far as the Oakland
office of the express oompany, and as
the company could show neither
receipt for. the amount, nor a letter
acknowledging its receipt, it made
good tbe sum.
Investigation by the postal departs
ment developed that the paokage of
two bundred dollars from Baltimoru
was sent to The National Ked Cross
Society in Washington- and never
came to San Franoisoo.
In no other instance has there been
report of missing, funds and in every
instance acknowledgment has been
made to the donor excepting for sums
sent in "chain letters."
Tbe finance committee of tbe -citi
zens' relief committee of fifty, con
sisting of tweutv-one prominent-busi
ness men of San Francisco, received
all funds, and the books of this
committee were examined by a repre
sentative of the National Ked Cio.s
Society, sent from Washington for
that purpose, who declared them kept
under a system that guaranteed tbeir
correctness,
The Massachusetts Association for
the relief of California, sent a com
mittee to San Francisco to investigate
the methods of relief work. This
committee came to San Franoiaco,
made a thorough investigation, and
on its return to Boston made a report,
going into detail and covering every
point in the work of relief in San
Franoisoo. This report resulted in
the immediate forwarding of the
balance of the money in the bands of
tbe Massachusetts organization, in
its summary of the situation the com
mittee says: . -
"Your committee has carefully in
vestigated the books, accounts,
methods and results- of the committee
having the matter in charge.
"It has met and consulted nith
very many leading men, professional
and business, in this city whose opin
ions were^valnable.
■ "We found one unanimous opinion,
whatever criticism might be made of
methods, or even of results, and that
was that the' gentlemen on that com
mittee and its executive committee
were of the highest standing and
character. ,
"We wish to express our opinion
in the most emphatic way that those
gentlemen are worthy of confidence.
They are doing tbe best they can to
meet an extremely ditUoult and dis
tressing situation."
James D. Hague, of the New York
chamber of commerce committee for
tbe relief of San Francisco, spent
several weeks in San Francisco in
vestigating conditions. After bis re
port was made to the New York body,
the funds, amounting to half a million
dollars, held by the New York com
mittee, were ordered turned over to
tbe San Francisco relief committee.
In the light of these investigations,
and after a thorough and complete
investigation of its own, the Cali
fornia promotion committee sum
marizes tbe situation as follows:
Only two sums of nionev have been
reported as missing, and these have
been traced. Neither ever reached
the hands of any one connected with
relief work in San Francisco.

relief corporation has been pronounc

California is remarkable for its
paucity of harbors, and tor tbe
magnificence of the few that it
possesses. On the Atlantic coast
between Boston, which is on a line
with tbe northern boundary of Cali
fornia, and Savannah, Georgia, which
is opposite San Diego, there are
many harbors, but. of them -all there,
is not one which nil! equal the har
bor of San Francisco, and but oue or
two which compare with San Diego
or Eureka harbors. ■ ~ " ■ ■ : -.
Every state on the Atlantic coast
which boasts, a harbor, makes much
of it, and more attention is paid to
Its development and maintenance
than to any other interest in the
common wealth, for the people there
fully* realize tbe value of a harbor to
tbe interior as' well as to the special
location of the entrepot. In the past
California has paid but little atten
tion to her harbors. The people of
tbe interior have bar) so many inter
ests to conserve that seemed of more
vital importance, that they have been
prone to overlook the advantages to
be derived from a system of harbors
which gives tbe whole state easy
access to the rrarkets of tbe world.
Tbe United States government is
being constantly called upon by
Eastern communities for harbor and
river improvement, and through
united action of the people there tbe
appropriations provided for by con
gress are carefully watched and efforts
made at once to get a large share for
unimportant harbors. If tbe people
of California would unite as do those
of Atlantio states, the harbors of
California would be in far better
condition, and in addition to federal
work such influence would be brought
to bear on the stata legislature as
would be effective in having our
harbors properly cared for. ■'
San. Francisco harbor is the ttne9u
in tbe whole world, and if it belonged
to any other oounty would be so
developed and improved as to make
it what nature intended it should be,
the best and safest haven for ships
ever known. At the meeting of the
National Rivers and Harbors Con
gress, which is to be beld In Washing
ton, D. C, California will have dele
gates who will use their best endeav
ors to have California harbors receive
tbe recognition to which they are
entitled, in order that a proportion
ate part of tbe millions annually ex
pended by the United States govern
ment may come to this state. :

MOHBY BOIHS OTTT OF COUKTT.
At the last meeting of the super
visors, the sum of $543.27 was allowed |
A. Carlisle & Co., printers and
stationers of San Francisco. This
was principally* for supplies of print-
Ing and- stationery for the election.
It was more than all tbe local papers
received for county printing and ad
vertising during the campaign. And
this money was paid out without any
protest, notwithstanding that there
is no rate fixed by the board for
suob supplies, as required by law.
Such a large sum would represent
the earnings of a printer for more
than halt a year. And the work goes
oat of the county to build up outside
communities rather than Amador
oounty. This is a state of affairs
that would not be tolerated in any
other oounty in tbe state, and it
ought not to be tolerated here. The
board of supervisors should carefully
adhere to the law, and fix tbe rate of
printing and advertising annually.
Certainly if printing is done by out
side firms, which might just as well,
and with a saving to the taxpayers,
b« don* in local offices, and tbe
claims are not legal in the strictest
■ens* of the word, they should da re
jected In the interest of home in
dustry, lo refuse payment of one or
two of these foreign claims would
speedily wind up that sort of busi
ness. The grand jury might spend a
little time very in
looking into this matter. These
members would be doing a real
service to the taxpayers in probing
this preference for outside shops to
the bedrook. But will they do so.

The advertised sale of the lone
Creamery is far from encouraging to
local enterprises. It is not so much,
that there is no scope for th« jnveet
maot of capital in development of
local affairs. Nor is from lack of
capital that would, other things being
equal, prefer such Investment. The
discouraging part of it is the reasons
assigned for the determination of the
directors to sell the property, and
wind op the affairs of tbe company.
lhe product of the creamery has
always been of the best grade. .The'
batter made bad achieved a reputa
tion second to none. It was sought
after, and sold readily. The output
was not equal to the demand. The
business might have been increased
many times over if the creamery were
oapable of such enlarged oatput. But
the cause of closing out is stated as
the disagreements and bickerings of
the stockholders. They could not, or
did not, work in harmony. The com
pany was split into contending forces,
and hence the conclusion to dis
organize.
DIVIDED BECTIONALLY.
Not since the Civil war has there
been a situation in the United States
senate which will parallel that which
will exist after March i next. Every
northern state will be represented by
republicans. The south will be re
presented by democrats, excepting
Missouri, whose representation con
sists of one republican and one demo
crat. The political complexion of
the sonate will stand sixty-one re
publicans and twenty-nine demooiats.
After Oklahoma has adopted a con
stitution and its legislature has been
empowered to elect senators, the
democratic total will be increased to
thirty-one. Three northern states,
Colorado, Montana and Idaho, are at
present represented by democratic
senators, bat id the recent election
all these resumed their place in the
republican column and the successors
of Patterson Clark and Dv bois will
be republicans. — Atchieson Globe.
The San Francisco grand jury is
hot on the trail of the municipal
grafters in that oity. According to
newspaper aocount, graft has been
uncovered, involving about every de
partment of the government. Indict
ments have been found against Mayor
Schmidt, Abe Kaef, and others, based
on disclosures made by alleged go
betweens of the administration. While
the probability is that there has been
mnoh graft going on, and the earnest
dope is that the crusade against
corruption will eventuate in landiDg
the grafters behind prison bars; still,
wa do not believe in condemning in
public estimation on a one-sided
statement. The grand jury investiga
tioo Is ex paite. But the papers take
it that the- charges are proven, and
tba accused oonvioted. Every man
accused of crime is entitled to a fair
and impartial trial. It is next to
impossible to get a square deal where
the papers are continually trying to
prejudice tbe public mind. Snob a
course is not only improper, but
against law. By the way, tbe evi
dence presented to a grand jury is
suppose.! to be secret. >o member of
that body is allowed to reveal any of
the proceedings, during the sessions
thereof. And yet day after day, the
oity papers publish column after
column of matter purporting to give
the grand jury proceedings. How is
it? Tbe evidence leaks out in some
manner, or the papers are doing a lot
of guessing.

BLENDING SPIRITS.
Curlooa Results Obtained by Mixing
W Whisky and Water.
Some curious results are shown by
blending of spirits. Take nineteen and
one-quarter -gallons of high proof spirits
and add twenty-two and one-fourth
gallons of water, and, strange to say,
you have forty gallons, and not forty
one and one-half, as one would natu
rally suppose. This Is reasonably ex
plained by the large globules of the
spirit absorbing the small globules 'of
water, thereby lessening the volume of
wine gallons.
Here is another phenomenon: Take
equal parts of whisky and water, each
at a temperature of 70 degrees F. Mix
them and the temperature rises at once
to 80 degrees.
If two barrels of whisky are placed
under a roof, one with the bung in and
the other with It out, the former will
fain In proof, while the latter will lose.
This is due to the fact that when the
bung Is In there Is no evaporation, bat
tbe barrel absorbs the water much fast
er than It does the whisky. When the
bong Is out there Is evaporation, and
tbe spirit evaporates easier than the
water.
These are a few of the facts (hat an
eld rectifier who can neither read nor
write has gathered In fifty years of ex
perience as a cellar man. He keeps
trace of his liquors by their marks,
and, strange to say, he can read his
gauges and thermometers with accu

As delicacies the Greeks ate young
foxes caught In the autumn, robins and
sparrows and certain kinds of fish
soared by moonlight. There Is a scrap
of an old Greek comedy In which a
cook boasts of frying a fish so exqui
sitely that It threw aim grateful looks
from the pan. A famous Greek dish
was the Trojan pig, half of it boiled
and the otber half roasted. It yu
stuffed with eggs, ortolans and

Coughing is the worst thing for a
cough, and In most Instances of eougb
there Is more conghlng than Is neces
sary to subserve the purpose of tbe
cough— l. c., to remove offending ma
terial. The following conditions will
help one minimize coughing hi all In
stances, while in the milder cases It
may stop the cough altogether after a
little perseverance: When tempted to
cough take a deep breath, filling If pos
sible every air cell, holding It until the
wanning, soothing effect comes or so
long as Is reasonable, and mark the
mollifying result on the cough, which,
even when the latter seems unavoid
able, will often be found under control.
The Horse*' Inferno.
"Paris is the inferno of horses" is a
very old aphorism. French cabmen
and carters have in general very little
lore for the horse. Many consider this
wretched quadruped as a simple tool,
a motor with four feet, rather than as
a precious servant worthy of regard
and consideration. Not a day passes

THE BLUEBEARD STORY.
lltI It Hat's Mythical Rather Than a
- . - Krtholoarlc«l Origin.
T Th« fascinating story of Bluebeard
h has a mythical rather than a mytho
llogical origin. No one has found his
p prototype In the Vedaa or in the old
G Greek or Roman authors. The story
t t> supposed to be of French origin,
•ad it has even been suggested that
B Bluebeard was no other than the much
m married Henry VIII. There Is, how-
e ever, better reason for believing that
t the original was Giles de Laval lord
o of Rtas, who was marshal of Prance
e early in the fifteenth century. Be was
a a brave soldier whose exploits m the
w wan between England and France are
r recorded \ in ■ history. According to
K Khieray, he murdered his wive* as
s soon as be tired of them, and was him-
s self eventually strangled in 1440.
The story of Laval has, however, not
many points of resemblance, for there
la no mention of a key, and Giles de
Laval, moreover, used to entice per-
sons of both sexes to bis castle for the
sake of their blood, which be wanted
for certain incantations be Indulged in.
Nor, Indeed, does the story fit in with
onr own Henry VIII., and we are left
to believe that, whatever the origin,
the key and Sister Ann were added for
the sake of effect. A variant of the
story of Giles de Laval Is told by Hol
lushed, In whose version the name is
Giles de Retz, Marquis de Laval, who
lived In Brittany, and was strangled
and burned for the murder of bis seven
wives. Dr. C. Taylor, it may be added,
regarded the story simply as fiction, a
satire on or type of the castle lords of
the days of knight errantry.— London

There was a "mothers meeting" at
Mrs Stumpff's on Wednesday last,
which was attended by the matrons of
this vioinity. It was a social gather
ing well received. As the meeting
was held at a motherless woman's,
doubtless she listened attentively to
tbe numerous ladies of matron
demeanor, and womanly capability.
Without jesting the gathering was
one of social friendship that might be
initated in the purest of social fields.
The dinner of the occasion was an
affair of gastronomic loveliness
worthy of tbe palate of anyoue, and
while it quieted the inner being, it
ieft too, a lasting impression linking
tbe matrons into a universal chain of
friendsbip and lasting remernberance
of social Jove. . -

Madam Andress gave an exhibition
of trained birds and dogs in Webb
ball Saturday afternoon. The show
was well worth seeing, demonstrating
the wonderful capacity of dumb
animals for training. Both birds and
dogs went through their antics with
a surprising amount of intelligence,
and seemed to enjoy showing their
proficiency quite as much as the
spectators. Mrs Andress is certainly
an adept in the art of training
animals. With one attendant, she
makes a business of traveling over the
country, not only exhibiting, bat
giving lessons in Ibis line. The
birds, are mostly from tropical
countries, and the cold weather that
prevailed was somewhat of a hardship
to them.

DESTRUCTIVE FIRE IN PLYMOUTH^
Levaggi 's General Store Gutted
and Stock Ruined.
The most disastrous tire Plymouth
has had for years occurred at an early
hour Sunday morning. B.'Levaggi,
tbe leading merchant of tbat town,
purchased tbe old Empire store over
a year ago. He has been gradually
moving bis stock therein, fixing up
the store in a manner superior to any
other store in tbe oounty. Only a
tew weeks baok he finished this work,
and had got nioely established in bis
new, and more commodious quarters,
when tbe fire iieud took a hand, and
spoiled the work of months' of labor,
and thousands of dollars of cost.
How or exactly when tbe tire
started is not known. There was a
dance in Plymouth Saturday night,
and patrons returning therefrom,
and passing the large brick store,
smeiled the odor of burning clothing.
The store was tightly closed, and no
smoke was visible. There was no
draught, and consequently no out
ward manifestation of the destructive
work that was going on inside. How
ever, the suspicious odors led to in
vestigation. The proprietor was
apprised of the suspicion, and about
half past five o'olook it was found
that a serious fire was raging inside.
Kealizing tbat the fire would be
greatly stimulated by opening tbe
doors before there were any means
at hand to tight the flames, it was
wisely determined to keep tbe store
closed for a time. There was no
water supply available. Somehow,
the town water works is not kept in
shape to fight fire at all hours.
Furthermore, there were no otber
apparatus for fire righting, In tbe
shape of chemical fire extinguishers
to be bad in town. In this dilemma,
messengers were dispatched to tbe
Fremont mine, three miles away,
for several chemical extinguishers
kept there. As soon us these were
secured, the store was entered. The
smoke and heat was something
terrible. But the extinguishers did
excellent work, and the Ore was got
under control in a brief time, with
the aid of water, that was turned on
after a while.
About tbe entire stock in the large
store was destroyed or ruined; except
tbe hardware portion and other goods
The tire was principally in tbe dry
goods and clothing department.
Everything in these lines was either
total or partially ruined. And tbe
entire inside was black witb smoke,
imparting a grimness and forbidding
aspect to the fixings and entire es
tablishment that bad only just been
placed in such natty and business
like shape. The stock was valued at
about 930,000. Probably tbe heaviest
merchandise stock in tbe county.
There was an insurance of only $4000.
Levaggi is a very heavy loser. He
was in no way discouraged by the
stroke of hard luck. He had been in
San Francisco on business, and only
reached borne tbe evening prior to
tbe tire- -just in time, as he expressed
it, to see it burn. He has another
store building some distance north
on Main street, and in this, his old
store, he was prepared to do business
in a short time. How the fire started
is a mystery. Some incline to tbe
theory tbat it was tbe work of an
incendiary. Still there was little
evidence to support this view. It
started in tbe cellar. There was no
doubt on that point. And tbe most
generally accepted explanation is that
it was a case ot spontaneous combus
tion. A barrel or so of waste was in
the cellar, and peihaps oily or fatty
rags were thoughtlessly placed there
in, which generated tbe tire.
Sunday was gala time at the skating
rink. There were estimated to be
fully 300 persons there in the evening.
All the skates that could be mustered
up in town were in use, and more
would have been hired if they were
to be had. Some 60 or 70 skaters
were gliding over the polished floor
at one time. It was quite a sight.
A number of patrons from outside
places were present, as the Jackson
rink is conceded to be the finest place
for this sort of amusement that Ama
dor connty has ever seen. Not a few
ugly tumbles were experienced, and
in two or three oases the services of a
doctor were culled tor. But these
little mishaps serve not to damp the
ardor in the least. The tumblers are
generally on their feet again and
spinning around as lively as if notn
ing bad happened. Skating is the
rage just now. It has taken Jackson
by storm.
All kinds of Christmas goods on
he way, at the Jackson Shoe Store.
Louis ii J iceanlo returned this week
from San fr'rancisco. He has been
doing teaming work there from soon
atter the tire. Lie brought back one
team. He will remain home tor some
time, probably through the winter.

. Telephone Line Knocked Out.
Tbe telephone business of Sutter
Creek was completely knocked out
last Wednesday afternoon in a peonliar
manner. It seems tbat tbe wire
oarrying 17,000 voltage of tbe electric
power line from Eleotra to Amador
City, fell on the lines of tbe Sunset
Telephone Co., at a point several
hundred feet from tbe Sutter Creek
central station. Tbe effect was to
barn the cable carrying over 100 wires
completely out, shutting oft all com
munication by telephone with that
town. Mot only were tbe fuses
burned out, but the main cable for
350 feet was ruined, and had to be
replaced. A force ot repairers was
put to work, and kept going night
and day, and tbe line was in working
order by Sunday night. This mishap
involved tbe company in an expense
estimated at $1000.
Accidentally Shot Himself.
Willis E. Hoss met wi*b a severe
accident last Tuesday. He was oat
on horseback about two miles from
bis ancle's home, W. C. Hoss. See
ing a polecat be undertook to shoot it
with a six shooter tbat be had with
him. While manipulating the weapon
preparatory to shooting, it was acci
dently discharged, tbe ballet striking
the second finger of the left band at
the second joint, shattering tbe bone.
Strange to say, be did not feel tbe
slightest pain, and really did not
know be bad shot himself until a few
seconds afterwards. Seeing tbe con
dition of bis hand, be started for
home. Tbe wound was dressed
temporarily at tbe home of W. M.
Nichols, and thereafter be came on
to Jaokson to have the finger surgi
cally dressed. The finger may have
to be amputated, bat that will be
determined later.
Children's Day.
Last Tuesday was observed by the
Native Daughters ot Ursula Parlor as
children's day. In tbe afternoon,
after school hours, the children of

Fellows hall to tbe number of nearly
40. A short program was gone

LIKE A ROMANCE.
A Story of Desertion and Long Hun
for Missing Father.
X T. Heath of Jaokson, Amador
county has been in Nevada City this
week for the twentieth time within
the past nine years. Mr Heath .says
he is the legitimate son of the pioneer
prospector ot Meadow Lake district
in Nevada county, who died suddenly
fourteen years ago under circum
stances that some people " thought
afterwards indicated foul play. The
old man was commonly known here
about as Henry H. Hartley, bat Heath
says bis true name was L. T. Heath.
The purpose of the former visits of
Mr Heatb of Jaokson, was to gather
evidence to establish bis identity as
the prospector's son, and thus get
possession of the property that was
left when be died. This week he
came to appear before the grand jury,
and on Wednesday last at two o'clock
in the afternoon be worked his way
into the presenoe ot tbat august
tribunal. He presented to tbe grand
jury a type-written document of three
pages wherein be practically charged
tbat bis father bad been murdered,
and be set forth in bia communi
cation and by word of mouth a re
quest for an Investigation into tbe
alleged mystery. Ho said the grand
jury oould get at tbe bottom of tbs
affair If it would summon oertain
witnesses including Kobert Camp
bell, a retired man or wealth living
at tbe city of Oakland, John Clark
who is a Meadow Lake mine owner
and prospeotor, and oertain otber
individuals living in Nevada county
and elsewhere.
Ibe grand jury sent for Henry
Daniels of Grass Valley, wbo was
ooroner at tbe time ot Hartley's deatb
and subsequently presided at an
autopsy and asked him some ques
tions. Having done tbia faith In
Heath's statements apparently van
ished, for he was politely passed op
to sheriff Walker and district attor
ney Jones wltb tbe suggestion tbat be
tell bis troubles to them.
Heath's statement was substantially
as follows: L. T. Heath, tbe Meadow
Lake prospeotor, was born in New
York In 1818, and in 1813 married
Sarab Doud. To them three obildern
were born, one of them being U. T.
Heath. Ihe father came to California
in 1851, settling first at Ousley Bar on
the Yuba river below Umartsville,
wbere be became justice of the peace
and was known as Judge Heath. He
wandered around In Amador county
and otber sections, coming to Nevada
county in 1857 and living in Grass
Valley and Nevada City, where he
was also known as Judge Heatb to
S. H. Dille of Grass Valley, James J.
Lweis of the Biyan ranob near Grass
Valley, and various otber men wbo
are still alive. Then he lett for
awhile returning in 1861 and settling
at Meadow Lake, wbere be was the
father of tbe boom tbat atruok tbat
camp and lasted one summer. From
tbe begining of his Meadow Lake
experience or a little earlier, he gave
his name as Hemy H. Hartley. In
the meantime be bad without divorc
ing himself from his first wife,
wedded a California woman named
Lucy Webster, wbo died in a few
years. In 1887 he married a woman
wbo came oat from England, and
who at bis death came into possession
ot bia property consisting of 210
acres of patented mineral land that
he owned under tbe name of Hartley.
She bad returned to England shortly
before bis deatb. His wife in the east
did not die till 1889. Mr Heath of
Jaokson, told the grand jury be Is
the only genuine surviving heir of
Hartley, and be proposes to tight to a
finish tbe claims of widow Hartley,
wbo is now known as Mrs Maude Alice
Bonnitleld, she having been, after
the deatb of Hartley, married to a
Reno lawyer, who Is dead. Mrs
Hartley-Bonmfleld had various trou
bles after her removal from Meadow
Lake to the State of Nevada, where
she shot to death one lawyer for a
moral wrong which she claimed he
had inflicted upon her. She went to
Denver after tbe deatb ot Bonnitleld,
and is said to be now in San Fran
cisco or Los Angeles.
Heath told tbe grand jury tbat be
hoped some time to establish tbe fact
that his father was murdered. He
said tbe old man awoke sictc one
morning in Ootober, 1892, and at
noon be died. There was. then no
suspicion ol fool play, and he was
quietly buried. Mrs Hartley npon
ber return from England, to which
country she bad gone a short time
before his deatb, bad tbe body dis
interred and an autopsy was held by
Coroner Daniels. It is claimed by
the son that evidences of arsenic poi
soning were found, and the conclusion
arrived as a result of :the autopsy
was that Hartley committed suicide
with rat poison. The son scouts the
suicide theory, and says that when
tbe time comes be will spring a lot
of testimony he has accumulated
since be came to California nine
years ago, to show tbat It was not a
case of Belt destruction. He declares
be will make it his llfework to bring
the alleged murderer to justice and to
secure tbe property wbicb passed to
Mrs Hartley-Bonnineld, when tbe old
man died. Tbe man from Jackson is
showing much persistency in pressing
his contention. — Miner-Transcript,
November 24.
Mr Heatb returned from bis trip
last Sunday. He spent three days in
Nevada City. He says be went there
well provided with documentary evi
denoe, and tbe names of witnesses
readily obtainable, to establish bis
claims as tbe beir of Hartley. Tbe
grand jury, however, treated him very
bluffly. He was not even given tbe
opportunity to give bis testimony
under oatb. The only witness ex
amined was U. Daniel, the coroner,
at tbe time of the inquest upon the
remains of Hartley, after they were
disinterred to determine the current
suspicions ot foal play. The papers
bearing on tbii inquisition, have, be
alleges, disappeared from tbe court
house reoords; and tbe manner and
time of tbeir disappearance cannot be
traced. According to Mr Ueatb, bis
father,— and be is fully satisfied tbe
prospector was Ma] father— was poi
soned. Two kinds of poison were
revealed by tbe analysis, so be says.
Tbe estate was probated under tbe
name of Hartley, and distributed to
bis wife. Tbe death occurred while
Mrs Hartley was on a visit Eng
land, and at her request tbe bod;
was disinterred, when she returned
on being apprised of bis 'death. Mr
Ueatb has been working incessantly
to locate bis father. He came to
California nine years ago specially
on this mission, and has been running
down clews ever since. He got on
what he believes tbe true solution—
that is Hartley, about two years after
oommg here. His father left no
other property than the mineral land,
240, acres at Meadow lake-10 miles
from Ulsco. One mine on this land
baa been operated oft and on foi
years. He says, that there is a
fortune involved in this contention;
tbat a fractional part of the land has
been estimated aa being worth several
hundred thousand dollars. He has
never met Mrs Hartley. When be left
Nevada Uity last Saturday, the dia
tiict attorney and the sheriff pro
mised to look into tbe matter further.
Mr Heatb is resolved not to let it
drop, and if nothing is done within
the next two months, be will appeal
to the governor to take action. There
i| no doubt he is thoroughly in
earnest, and believes he is tbe right
ful heir to a large fortune. He is a
poor man, working as a laborer tor
tbe city authorities of Jaokson.
A County Sana tar ium.
A movement tbat must meet witb
the unqualified approval of tbe people
generally has been quietly, bat
effectively promoted by two or three
enterprising citizens, and has now
reached • stage tbat ensures its
successful oompletton. It Is for the
establishment of a sanitarium or hos
pital for tbe treatment of surgical
oases and diseases at a central point
in Amador county. Wltb tbe com
pletion of tbe railroad to tbe mineral
belt; such an enterprise, if properly
managed cannot be otherwise than a
sucoess. The principal promoters are
Dr. fillips of Jaoksoo, and Dr. Uood
manof Satte* Creek. Tbe matter has
been canvassed throughly, particular
ly with tbe view of enlisting the
mine owners In support or tbe
scheme. In this direotion every
encouragement has been given. As it
Is now, employes meeting with acci
dents requiring surgical operations
are often sent to the large oities for
treatment, not because of lack of
surgical skill, but because of lack of
conveniences and conditions for the
proper care of such oases. To obvi
ate this, the proposed sanitarium is
to be started. It will also be for
general treatment. With our splendid
and invigorating climate, it is ex
peoted to command support fiom
outside points. By the payment of:
II per month, employes of tbe mines
who become sick or disabled from
accident, will be given treatment
and nursing at tbe hospital. Of
course a reasonable charge for board
will be made, bat beyond this every
thing will be included In the montbly
one dollar fee. Patients will be free
to make special arrangements witb
any doctor to attend them, if they so
prefer.
A suitable Bite has been secured on
the grounds of tbe Oneida Mining
Company for tbe erection of the
building. Plans and specification for
tbe building have already been made
out and adopted. It Is expected that
work on the building will be com
menced right away. It will be pro
vided witb everything requisite for
such an institution. From 18000 to
110,000 will be expended In tbe build
ing and equipments. In two or three
months, it Is hoped to have tbe
sanitarium ready for business. It is
certainly one ot tbe most argent
needs of this section, and should
meet with tbe good will and aotlve
support of every resident anxious to
promote the interests of Amador
county.

"Billy" Blue Passes Away.
William Blue, a well-known char
acter around Jaokaon for orer twenty
years, answered to the calls of the
last enemy on Tuesday. His end was
not altogether unexpected, although
when tbe attack cams it moved rapid -
lv to dissolution. Monday morning
be was around as usual, doing some
little wotk around Green's saloon,
as was bis custom for a long time.
In tbe afternoon be was seized with
two fits In rapid succession. He was
thereafter removed to tbe hospital.
He gradually became worse, and died
tbe same evening. He was about &V
years of age, and a native of Soot
land. He fell a victim to alcohol
ism. He was a- bard drinker for
many years, a slave to the liquor
habit. It was wonderful that he
withstood tbe undermining influence
of drink ao long. Its effects were
portrayed In his features and every
movement. Tbe babit never got him
into trouble, as he was ever inoffen
alve. It is reported tbat he left a
wife in Chicago, also a son, tbe latter
grown to manhood. A tew years ago
he went back to Cbioago, tbe necess
ary lands being sent to him for that
purpose. He stayed bat a short time,
tbe ways not being up to bis Cali
fornia habits. He got back to bis
haunts in Jaokson as beat be could.
Before being taken to tbe hospital,
he passed Monday night in Newman's
stable, wbere be frequently slept.
There he was seized with several vio
lent fits,- and seeing that tbe end was
coming, be was moved to tbe county
institution In the morning. Tbe con
vulsions or fits recurred at intervals
until be died. He was apparently
beyond consciousness, and unable to
recognize any one. A subscription
was taken up to give him a burial.
Tbe funeral took place Thursday,
interment in tbe Jackson cemetery.
He leaves a brother in El Dorado.

TOO HUMBLE A HUSBAND.
Poaltion of Prince Albert, Royal
Consort of Queen Victoria.
A woman looked up with a laugh
from a heavy volume she was reading.
"Now I know," she said, "why Queen
Victoria was so fond of the prince con
sort This husband did not merely re
gard his wife as his equal; he regarded
her as Immeasurably his superior, say-
Ing that It was his duty to sink bis
own individual existence in her. Lis
ten to this letter that Prince Albert
wrote to the Duke of Wellington. Here
Is a champion of woman's rights in
deed. Don't you think, though, it Is
going too far for a man to humble
himself so low as this?"
She then read from her book In a
sarcastic voice:
My Dear Duke— ln the question whether
It Is advisable that I should take the
command of the army I have come to the
conclusion that my decision ought entire
ly to b« guided by the consideration
whether It would Interfere with or assist
my position of consort to the sovereign.
This position Is a most peculiar and deli
cate one. While a female sovereign has
* great many disadvantages in compari
son with a king, yet if she is married and
her husband understands and doea his
duty her position, on the other hand, has
many compensatory advantage* • and In
the long run will be found to be stronger
even than that of the male sovereign.
But this requires that the husband should
entirely sink his own Individual existence
la that of his wife and that he should aim
at no power by himself or for himself,
being content to be the hueband of the
queen, the private secretary of the sov
ereign and the tutor of the royal chil
dren.
Reading on a Train.
If yon travel back and forth into
town every day you no doubt read
your paper or a magazins on the train.
While this Is not, indeed," the best prac
tice for the eyes, it seems a pity to
waste so much time which might be
turned to good account. Much of the
annoyance which comes from train
reading is due to the jolting of the
cars, which continually knocks the
printed line out of focus with the eye.
Tbla can be in some degree obviated
by laying a card or some other object
below the line to be read and moving
It steadily downward while reading.
This acts as a guide to the eye and
helps to keep the sight fixed. Those
who have' tried It say that it wonder
fully assists to decrease the difficulty
of reading while In motion.
Trade E^mblema on Tombstone*.
In Scotland it was for a long time
usual to place on a man's tombstone
the symbols of his trade. Especially
.was this the case at Dunblane, where,
in the burial ground of the abbey, It
has been found that of those tomb
stones which are from 100 to 200 years
old about one-fourth are thus marked,
the symbols being In low relief. A
sugar cane may be seen as showing
the grave of a grocer; an ax and saw,
with hammer and nails, occur on the
grave of a carpenter; an awl and a
hammer on that of a shoemaker. There
are many other graves similarly
marked. — London Answers.
C Catting Eyelashes.
An eyelash is pointed. A cut laali la
blunt. A lash once cut never agalm
becomes pointed. Every lash live 3 a
variable time and then falls out to b«
replaced by a fresh oue. When a cut
lash so falls the newcomer is pointed.
So any mischief resulting from cutting
the lashes will be remedied by time.
Opinions differ as to whether lash cut
ting promotes growth. That it renders
the lashes unsightly is very certain.
Tb* Orange Tree.
The orange is the longest lived fruit
tree.- It begins to bear the third year
after budding, and for 100 years It will
yield abundant crops. Orange trees
hare been known to attain the ripe
age of 300. The orange requires less
care and attention than any other fruit
tree. Its early growth Is rapid. In the
first two years It grows more than It
will in the next fifty. This refers of
course to Its height and breadth alone
— Its fruit stems and consequently Its
crop* Increase more rapidly after the
first ten years.
Here is oar condensed opinion of
the original laxative cough syrup:
"Nearly all other cough syrups are
constipating, especially those con
taining opiates. Kennedy's Laxative,
(containing) honey and tar moves the

Or. Pierces Favorite Prescription
la a powerful, Invigorating tonic Impart
ing health and strength in perfloular
to the organs distinctly feminine. The
local, womanly health Is so Intimately
related to the general health that when
diseases of tho delicate womanly oivana
are cured the whole body gains in health
and strength. For weak and sickly
women who are "worn-out," "run-down"
or debilitated, especially for women who
work in store, office or schoolroom, who
sit at the typewriter or sewing machine,
or bear heavy household burdens, and for
nursing mothers, Dr. Pierces Favorite
Prescription has proven a priceless
benefit because of its health-restoring
and strength-giving powers.
As a soothing and strengthening nerv
ine. "Favorite Prescription" is nn
equaled and is invaluable in allaying and
subduing nervous excitability, irritabil
ity, nervous exhaustion, nervous prostra
tion, neuralgia, hysteria, spasms, chorea,
or St. Vltus^ dance, and other distressing
nervous symptoms commonly attendant
upon functional and organic disease of
the womanly organs. It induces refresh-
Ing sleep and relieves mental anxiety and
despondency.
Cures obstinate cases. "Favorite Pre
scription " is a positive cure for the most
complicated and obstinate cases of "fe
male weakness," painful periods, irregu
larities, prolapsus or falling of the pelvic
organs, weak back, bearing-down sensa
tions, chronic congestion, inflammation
and ulceration.
Dr. Pierces medicines »re made from
■armless bat efficient medical rootr
found growing in «ur American forests
The Indians knew of the marvelous cura
tive value of some of these root* and im
parted that knowledge to some of thr
friendlier whites, and gradually some of
the more progressive physicians came to
test and use them, and ever since they
have grown in favor by reason of their
superior curative virtues and their faf(
and harmless qualities.
Your druggists sell the "Favobttb Pbk
scbiption " and also that famous alters

"DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS.
Progressive Conundrum That Could
Be Worked Ont Two Ways.
"Miss Grade," he said, with an en
gaging smile, "did you ever try your
hand at one of these progressive conun
drums ?"
"What are progressive conundrums,
Mr. Spoonamore?" inquired the young
lady. '
"Haven't you heard of them? Here
Is one: Why is a ball of yarn like tne
letter 't'? Because a ball of yarn is
circular, a circular Is a sheet, a sheet la
a. flat, a flat is $50 a month, $50 a
month is dear, a deer is swift, a swift
Is a swallow, a swallow la a taste, a
taste Is an inclination, an inclination
is an angle, an angle is a point, a point
is an object aimed at, an object aimed

is a stamp, a stamp is a thing stuck on,
•a thing stuck on is a young man in
love, nnd a young man In love is like
the letter t because he stands before
'v,' Miss Gracie."
"I don't think }-ou have the answer
quite right," said the young lady.
"A. ball of yarn Is round, a round is
a steak, a stake is a wooden thing, a
wooden thing is a young man In love,
and a young man in love is like the
letter 't' because, Mr. Spoonamore—
and she spoke clearly and distinctly —
"because he is often crossed."
The young man understood. He took
his hat and his progressive conundrums
and vanished from Miss Gracie Gar

Vitality A-plenty In Monastic Life.
Oh, my friend, you may prate of
wasted lives and idleness and the para
sites of the church and all that sort of
thing, but I fear It Is. little you know
about the vital forces that are feeding
and sustaining and strengthening it
every hour of the four and twenty.
If I could show you the letters that
came to me from that friar in the south
Of Europe, letters bubbling over with
health and happiness and the sweetest
resignation, and then show you a photo
graph of a young man in tonsure and
cowl, with the calmest, clearest eyes
that ever looked out from under a
placid brow: if you could have felt of
his knotted biceps and known the grasp
of his small but powerful hand and
heard the peal of his hearty laughter—
for his spirit was bubbling over even
there in his serene solitude — you would
perhaps begin to understand why the
monastic lite, in spite of its tranquillity,
never stagnates and why the more you
contend .igainst the spirit of the re
ligious order 3 the more they live and
thrive.— Fron "A Fin de Siecle Friar"

From Our Exchanges
On Wednesday tbe depositions of
fifteen witnesses in tbe case of Ernest
K. Wood vs. tbe Globe Democrat
Printing Company of St. Louis, were
taken before justice C. H. MoClory.
Wood is suing for $600,000 damages,
alleged to have been sustained to his
character at the hands of the com
pany in a libelous article appearing
in their paper some time ago. Ernest
E. Wood was formerly a resident of
this town and ran for the office ot
district attorney of Calaveras county
on tbe republican ticket in IH9B,
being beaten by only a small major
ity. Afterward Wood removed to St.
Louis, and later was elected to con
gtess from the twelfth district of
Missouri, running on tbe democratic
ticket. It was claimed that bis elec
tion was not legal and a contest was
made. No decision was reached, how
ever until last May, at wbich time the
republican was seated; Wood in the
meantime served two terms in con
gress.- The libel Edit grew out of
articles appearing in tbe Ulobe Demo
crat derogatory to his good character,
bence tbe taking of depositions as to
bis reputation while a resident of this
town. Tbe depositions for Wood were
taken by A. Barry, while Snyder &
Snyder looked after tha work tor tbe
Ulobe- Democrat. —Prospect.
Tbe supervisors of Calaveras, Ama
dor and San Joaquln counties will
meet Sunday at Mrs liill'd place near
Camanohe to consider the question of
a bridge across the Mokelumne river.
Tbe proposed bridge would be near
tbe junction of tbe three counties
and if built it will be done by tbe
joint payment of tbe same. It is
hardly apparent to us that Calaveras
would be benefltted by sucb a bridge
commensurate with tbe cost. There
is already a free bridge at Camancbe,
which seems to be sufficient for tbe
needs of that portion of tbe county.
It looks as though tbe main use of
such bridge would be by tbe people
of Amador wbo wist to go to Btookton
for business.— Prospect.
On Tuesday morning at about 9:15,
tbe little, and only child of Mr and
Mrs Li. A. Aloberry, Miriam Catherine,
passed away at tbe family borne iv
this city. Tbe little girl was two
years and twelve days old. The cause
of death was an intestinal obstruction,
caused probably by tbe little one
having eaten some almonds wbich had
fallen from trees growing in tbe yard.
Little Miriam was playing about in
the yard last Sunday morning, where
her grandfather, J. W. Surface, was
cleaning up tbe leaves from about the
trees, and about 11 o'clock in the
forenoon, began to complain of pains
in her bowels. Dr. Adams was soon
summoned and everything possible
was done, but tbe obstruction remain
ed in tbe bowela and her death ensued
in less than 48 hours from the time
she first began to oomplain.— Eobo.
Last Saturday evening, as K. C.
Downey waa driving one of John

place near the Kennedy mine, where
tbe two roads are; one a couple or
feet, or nearly so, below tbe other, a
man who was coming up tbe grade,
driving fast, ran into one of Downey's
horses, causing bim to jump from tbe
upper to the lower road. Of course
the wagon followed — one wheel at
least, and the rig was overturned, Bob
Downey having bis collar bone broken
in the accident. Bob's face was con
siderably skinned. Tbe commercial
man was not hurt as be bad chosen a

OAK AND PINE.
The Value and Usefulness of These
Classes of Woods.
Though generally assumed that oalc
is the wood capable of being put to the
greatest variety of uses, it is knowu, as
a matter of fact, that the pine is really
the most used, on account of its great
abundance. Xtsvertheless, the timber o-f
the osk combines in itself the essential
elements of strength and durability,
hardness and elasticity- in a degree
which no other tree can boast, unrival
ed as n material of shipbuilding, also
superior in architecture, eabinetrnak
ing, carving, mill work, cooperage and
innumerable other purposes, while the
bark is of great value as furnishin
tan and yielding a bitter extract in con
tinual demand for medicinal purposes.
But of uses for the pice details would
be well nigh endless. The timber is in
valuable in houses uud ship carpentry;
common turpentine is extracted from it
In vast quantities and immense sup
plies of tar, pitch, resin and lampblack.
In the manufacture of matches, and,
above all, paper pulp, thousands and
tens of thousands of acres of pine for
ests are cut down every year, and,
briefly, the timber of this tree, consti
tuting as it does the chief material of
English and American builders, may be
said to be more used than all other
kinds of wood put together.
Tried the Effect of a Title.
Among the neighbors who annoyed
Carlyle none perhaps gave him so
much trouble as the boys who played
about near his house. They made no
secret of their dislike of the philoso
pher and stood in dread of his stick
when he went abroad. James Waylen,
who did a great part of fhe research
for the "Cromwell," and who was at
Carlyle's house almost daily, was one
morning standing on the doorstep of
the house In Cheyne row waiting to
be let in when one of these young
urchins came up to him in a deferen
tial manner, and, touching his cap,
said: "Please, sir, would you ask
Lord Carlyle to give me my top? It's
tumbled down his airey." During the
morning's work Carlyle and Waylen
chuckled together over the conciliatory
title which the lad had created for his
enemy.
An Uncanny Plant.
On the shores of Lake Nicaragua is
to be found an uncanny product of the
vegetable kiuglom known among the
natives by the expressive, name of "the
devil's noose." Dunstun, the natural
ist, discovered it while wandering on
the shores of the lake. Attracted by
cries of pain and terror from his dog
he found the animal hold by black,
sticky bands, which had chafed the
skin to bleeding point. These bands
were branches of a uewly discovered
carnivorous plant, which h.as been aptly
named the "laud octopus." The
branches are flexible, black, polished,
without leaves, and secrete a viscid
fluid.
Where Total Eclipses Are Rare.
It is a fart well known to astron
omers that the average number of total
and partial eclipses in any ouo year is
four; that the maximum is seven and
the minimum two. Where only two
occur they are always both of the sun.
There are a great many more eclipses
of the sun In tlio coarse of a year or
a hundred years than there are of the
moon. This fact notwithstanding,
however, London, the metropolis of the
world, seems to be a place where such
obstructions to the sun's light seldom
occur.
A Better Mntch.
Briggs— That was a narrow escape
Bildergnte had, wasn't it? You know
he was just about to marry a girl when
he found that she spent $2,500 a year
on her dresses. Griggs— Yes, but he's
married all the same. Briggs— True,
but lie didn't marry that girl. Griggs—
He didn't! Who did he marry,
then? Brigg3--Her dressmaker.—Lon
don Mail.
A carefully greased needle will float
upon water, though, of course, the steel
Is much heavier than a similar bulk af
water.
