The mystery of the spiral nebulae
of the sky is further from solution
than is sometimes supposed. Prof. T.
J. J. See rejects tbe theory that they
are true nebulae condensing into sys
tems of worlds or stars, as no proof
exists that they are gaseous nebulae
at all, while it is by no means certniu
tbat nebulae form stars. The outline
ot the spirals suggests repulsion rather
than condensation, this view being in
harmony with recent j investigations
of radioactive and other repulsive
forces.jj Tbe circularity of the plane
tary orbits makes it absurd to assume
that the solar t.ystem ever formed
part ot a spiral nebula. A present
we must, admit that the nature of the
spiral nebulae is quite unkowu; nn<i
while we caunnt be sure that nebulae
develop into stars, we may justly
hold tbat the stars are the outgrowth
of gravitational condensation of
matter which wns once dark.
January was made memorable by the
unusually high atmospheric pressure
that prevailed over western Europe
during most of the month. The -ex
treme was reached on the 23rd, when
the barometric reading was H1. 58 in
ches at Kiga, and the region of 31 in
ohes and above embraced parts of Eng
land, Scotland and Ireland, all pre
vious records being exoeded at some
stations. The highest reading on rec
ord at any place is 31.72 inches, whicb
occurred at Irkutsk Dec. 'JO. 18UG, and
at Semipalatinsk Dec. IG, 1877. The
lowest record on tbe earth's surface,
and reduced to sea-level, is 27. IS iu
cbes,and this was made atFalse Point,
on the coast of Orissa, British India,
Sept. 22, 1885.
The promisiug elastic road now be
ing tested atZnrich consists of a thick
rolled layer of Uno tarred gravel. The
grains, about a twelfth ot an inch in
size, were coated with tar in a revol
ving drum, and then hardened for
two months.
The problem of life's origin contin
ues to be attacked patiently and per
sistently, and we cannot tail to find
something of interest in such work as
that of Dr. H. C. iSastian, F. K. S.,
who now, alter more than thirty years
of- investigation, bas produced living
organisms from what be believes to
have been lifeless chemicals. After
being heated and hermetically sealed
in tubes, various saline solutions con
taining ammonical salts were again
beated, in a calcium chloride bath, to
temperatures ranging from 239 deg.
to 2(5(3 deg. Fahr. Accord iiig to ac
cepted theories, the tubes should have
been absolutely sterile, and every
trace ot lile should have been des
troyed. The lubes were then exposed
to diffused daylight or placed in an
incubator for five weeks to four
mouths. When opened, all contained
one or more kinds of raicro-orgau
isms. but control tubes, which had
been exposed only a few hours, showed
no traces of snub organisms. The so
lutions seem to have lacked carbon —
tbe universal constituent of living
things— though containing silicon, its
chemical ally.
Tho normal pulse has a wide ratfge,
but is always taster in females than
males, and steadily declines from
birth to death. Imminent physicians
have thought it possible to tell a
person's sex ana uge from tho pulse
ulone. The average rate at birth is
100 beats a minute in girls and 150 in
boys; at the uge ot four ni five 110
aud 100; iv maidens and youths, i)ij
and W: iv mature women and men, 80
and 75; and in elderly women and
men, CO and 50. In one recorded
case the pulse of-a healthy man of 87
was only 30 a minute. The pulse
varies witb stature, position of body,
exercise and health and in disease it
has beeu known to fall to 14 a minute.

The odors of metals— long neglected
..nil nfteu stated to have no existence
—are shown by the remarkable experi
ments of C. Liruhu, of Berlin, to be
due to something different from
volatilized -metal, and it is inferred
thnt these and other ordors are
analogous to radioactive phenomena.
Copper, aluminum, tin, zinc, Jead,
iron, etc., have a taint smell at
ordinary temperatures. This is not
att'ected by cleanness or oxidization,
but ou beating to 100 degrees or 120
degress P. the odor becomes at first
much stronger, gradually diminish
ing. After the metal is cooled two or
three hours, beating again produces
the same elfect. The experiments
seem to prove tbat tbe odor is dne to
ii transformation product from tbe
atoms of the metal, aud that the cold
metal stores this emanation to tbe
point ot saturation and gives it off on
beating. Some of the odorous matter
has beeu separated and isolated in n
vessel— just as radium emnnation bas
iici'ii isolated.
Vibratory massage is applied to the
treatment of catarrhnl deafness by
□leans ot a now apparatus resembling
tbe ear-piece of a telephone! receiver,
and quite surprising results are
claimed. For good hearing it is
oeeeseaty tbat^vibrations be transmitt
ed freely from the ear-drum through
a chain of little bones or ossioles.
In catnrrlial deafness tbe bones are
stiffened by mucus, and tbe new
apparatus transmits the vibrations in
spite. of tho stiffening, both giving
present hearing aud tending to restore
normal action. Little diaphragms'
acted on by electromagnets transmit
the wave motion to the ear.
The curious cork-like subsiance
produced by Erdmaun and [Kothuer
of Charlottenburg, results from the
action of acetylone on heated copper.
It ia an interesting product, but must
be given greatly increased strength to
make it a complete substitute for
cork. ,

Letter.
Washington, February 22. 1907.
During tbe past week tbe Japanese
question has been— or, rather, ha
pretended to have been settled by tbe
passage of tbe immigration bill con
taining tbe president's provision
placing in bis hands tbe power to
exclude Japanese from California It
he shall deem that ttiey will be a de
triment to labor conditions on tbe
coast. In return the San Francisco
sbool board will admit Japanese
pupils to all the public schools. This
arrangement of tbe difficulty presents
one or two points in line with tbe
argument of congressman MoCall in
bis notable speech in New York warn
ing the country against the growing
tendency to centralize tbe powei of
the government in tbe chief executive.
In tbe case of tbe amendment to tbe
immigration bill, tbe fact is patent
tbat the president has piactioally
usurped tbe legislative function of
congress, for the amendment was
placed in a bill already in conference
and was forced through under a
threat and a promise without permitt
ing either branch of congress to
debate it. The threat was tbat if tbe
bill was not passed an extra session
would be oalled, and-the promise was
tbat although tbe provisions relative
to contract labor in wbicb tbe south
ern states are interested were changed,
tbe ruling made under tbe bill wbiob
has been superseded shall stand. It
is plain tbat if a measure of such
importance as this can be enacted
into law in this way, otbet and per
haps more vital questions oan be dis
posed of without undergoing tbe
scrutiny of the senate and tbe bouse.
But it begins to appear fprobable
that tbe diplomacy of tbe president
witb Japan and tbe concession ot
mayor Sohmitz and the Sao Franoisoo
boaid of education to tbe president
will not remove tbe friction between
the two countries, although tbe presi
dent may, as be is authorized to do,
admit as many Japanese into Cali
fornia as be may see fit in order to
placate Japan, it is already reported
tbat the administration bas tbe
Japanese on its hands, and tbat it sees
the desirability of increasing its
naval strength in Pacific waters.
Yesterday a conference was beld at
the White House between tbe presi
dent, admiral Dewey, tbe officers of
the navy general board, tbe chief of
the bureau of navigation and tbe
secretary of the navy. Tbe proceed
ings were secret, and secretary Met
oalf beoame somewhat beated when a
reporter made inquiries about tbe
conference. It is understood, bow
ever, tbat the advisability of increas
ing our Pacific fleet was discussed in
the light of our present relations witb
Japan, and that there arose tbe ques
tion of an emergency appropriation
by congress to be used in case there
were need of large sums of money
before tbe next session, in view of
tbe easy victory won by Japan over
the administration, it would not be
surprising it other demands were
made that will not permit of solution
without greater concessions on our
part.
Quartermaster general Humphrey
bas notified senator Perkins tbat tbe
repairs to the army transport "Sheri
dan" will be made at Mare Island.
The bids from private yards weie
Moore & Scott, 9111,221; Union Iron
Works, 9463,713; Risdon Iron and
Locomotive Works, 9173,920. General
Humphrey states tbat these bids are
so high as to render it practically im
possible to award the work to a pri
vate firm and tbat tbe estimate of tbe
navy department is so much lower
that it will be necessary to request
that department to tiojthe work. Unly
such repairs will be made as will
place the vessel in the condition it
was before going ashore. Tbe navy
yard will therefore have this im
portant work to perform, which will
bo appreciated by the mechanics ot
Vallejo.
Late Tuesday night senator Perkins
secured the passage by the senate of
the bill introduced by governor
Gillett while in congress, amending
the debris act. Tbe amendment
authorizes and empowers tbe debris
commission to order tbat bydraulio
mining may be carried on without
First going to a needless expense of
building dams, barriers, etc., wbere
tbe same oan be done without injur
ing tbe navigation of said rivers or
the lands lying adjacent thereto, in
every instance to mine, a petition to
do so must first be presented to tbe
commissioners, who have .the right
to make inquiry into all of tbe con
ditions existing; whether or not a
dam shall or shall not be built re
mains in their discretion, if they
deem one necessary, then they pre
scribe the character of it and bow it
shall be constructed ; if on tbe other
band, they conclude no dam is necess
ary, they so find tbe fact to be and
issue an order to mine without one.
Lying away back |in tbe mountains,
at tbe headwaters of small creeks and
canyons and many miles from the
Sacramento and Sun Joaquin rivers,
are many small placnr claims, owned
by poor people, tbat can be mined
on a small scale for several months
each year without doing any injury
or detriment to tbe navigable rivers
or to the land adjacent thereto with
out constructing dams, reservoirs, or
barriers for impounding debris.
Many of these mines are ot such small
value as not to warrant the construc
tion of a dam, and in many instances
no dam is required or should be built.
Some time ago Hon. Francis Cuttle
of Kiveraide, chairman ot the tri
couutles reforestation committee,
wrote to senator Perkins in regard to
securing government aid in the re
foresting of denuded areas in the iSau
Bernardino forest reserve, planting
trees where the standing timber is too
thin to conserve to best advantage the
rainfall, and in preventing the
further destruction of trees and brush
within the reserve. The matter was
called to the attention of the agri
cultural department, which through
tbe bureau of forestry, took great
interest in the subjeot, and yesterday
fui eater I' indict wrote to senator
Perkins as follows:
"1 entirely agree with Mr Cuttle
that this work is extremely important
and 1 shall be veiy glad to set aside
the sum of 95,000 for it, provided the
California legislature appropriates m>
equal amount. The {5,000 which tbe
forest service would allot for the
work will not be available, 1 regret
to say, until July Ist, since all of tne
funds at present at our disposal will
be needed for regular administrative
work and tbe money will hare to be
taken from the appropriation for tbe
next ttaoal year. 1 do not think,
however, that this taut should prevent
tbe state legislature, if they should
decide upon the appropriation of 85,
000 for tbe work, to make it available
at once.
"Such an arrangement would per
mit the work to go right on if the
money already subscribed by the
forest ' service and the counties of
Riverside and San Bernardino is ex
pended before July Ist 1 sincerely
nope tbe legislature will be able to
make the appropriation and 1 shall
be glad to take up, with the proper
authorities, at any time the details of
an agreement, whicb must necessarily
be entered into with the forest ser
vice."
Senator Perkins at once telegraphed
to Mr Cattle the suggestion of for
ester Pinobot that the legislature may
be informed of tbe situation and the
appropiiation secured.
Senator Flint from the committee
on public lands last week reported
favorably senator Perkin's bill pro
viding « way by which the govern
ment conld secure the Calaveras big
Xree'groves, but when tbe measure
bad tbus been got before the senate
it met with an objection and the
result is that the bill will not in ail
probability be passed at this session
of congress.
Tbe naval bill was passed by tbe
senate late Wednesday evening. it
carries appropriations aggregating
1248.500 for the Mare Island Navy-
Yard, of wbiob $100,600 was secured
by senator Perkins and congressman
Knowland for a central power station.
Last Wednesday senator Perkins
and congressman Kahn each intro
duced a bill providing for the ap
pointment of an additional district
judge for tbe northern district of
California, for tbe reason the ior&ier
bill wbicb passed tbe house of repre
sentatives for an additional district
judge was loaded down with an
amendment in the senate providing
for two additional judges for tbe
ninth ciiouit. This tbe bouse retused
to concur in and referred the bill to
tbe judiciary committee who decline
to consider it.
Tbe river and harbor bill has passed
tbe senate witb tbe appropriations tor
tbe San Joaquin and Sacramento
rivers and for other objects as pre
viously set forth in these letters.
Tbe Grand Parlor of the .Native
Sons of the Uolden West desires to
bold its annual session in 1008 in the
Yosemlte valley, and applied to the
depaitment of the Interior for a per
mit to do so. The department while
ottering no objection to the plan,
thought it was too far in advance of
tbe date of meeting to issue a permit
now, as work might in the meanwhile
be undertaken that might be interfer
ed with by tbe proposed "camp. It
therefore suggested that the applica
tion be made again in about a year.
But the Grand Parlor must state the
place of meeting noxt spring, and it
is theiefore necessary to know very
soon whether permission can be
granted, and it was written to tbe
California delegation on tbe subject.
Ibey will endeavor to secure from
tbe department of tbe interior the
neoessary permit before the Grand
Parlor meets in April.
The chamber of commerce of Venice
a few days ago wrote to the secretary
of the navy requesting that a suitable
craft be detailed for tbe training of a
division^of tbe young men of southern
California who are .interested in naval
militia work. Tbe secretary of the
navy has informed the chamber that
inasmuch as there is not an. organized
division of the navel militia in that
section of tbe state, tbe department
will be unable to detail a vessel for
tbe purpose. He suggests that a
division be organized, and when this
is done it will be able to share in tbe
state's share of tbe allotment for
naval militia and will be able to se
cure arms, equipment, etc., and a
vessel when available.
Congress bus refused to sanction
the imposition of a tax on the pro
duction of electric power througb
streams in forest reservations. This
plan of the forestry bureau has been
strenuously combatted by Hon. Frank
H. Short of Fresno, who has con
ducted tbe oases of power companies
which desire to utilize the water
power of the reserves. The action
taken by the senate, if concurred in
by tbe bouse of representatives, will
enable all streams to be utilized to
the best advantage without tbe pay
ment of toll to the government.

How Poll Tax Counts Up,
Where poll tax Is not paid by a
party owning real estate it constitutes
a lien on the property until paid, and
should the .property be sold by the
one who owes the poll tax the pur
chaser must pay the tax in order to
have a clear title. Our attention was
called to a chsc ot this kind this
week. A pertain man, in 1804, tailed
to pay bis poll tax. In June, 1895,
the property was sold to the State ior
this reason. The man subsequently
sold tbe property to auother and the
purchaser has now discovered there is
a State claim against it for SIO.CO.
Redemption was made this week.
This is the way it counted up when
the poll tax ot 82 was not paid : De
linquent poll tax, SI, interest Tlrom
189i> to 1907. M.60; penalty on re
demption, 32; total, SIO.UO. It's boat
to pay up promptly. -Exchange.

Her prayers gees up to heaven aoove—
This is a dear mother's love.
A love that if you faint and fall
Beneath the burden ot your cross,
She shares your grief and sorrows all,

A love all patnent to endure,
A love forever strong and sure,
Vet meek and gentle as a dove—

A love no time can chill or change—
Or trom its deep foundation move —
This is a precious mother's love.
A love that will unchanging be
Though all the glad eternity,
Part of that blessed life above-
This is a tender mother's love.

LAWS IN CHINA.
They Take >o Account of tbe Inten-
tions of the Accused.
The incompatibility of laws based
on diverse civilizations is nowhere
more marked than in China, says Ho
sea B. Morse in the Atlantic. There
no bankruptcy law is possible. If a
debtor's own estnte will not suffice to
pay his debts the deficiency must be
made good by bis father, brothers or
uiu-les; if a debtor absconds his im
mediate family are promptly imprison
ed; if the debtor returns he is put In
prison and kept there indefinitely, so
long as he can find "money for his
dally food until released by payment
In full or by death. This is the law.
When in 1595 Admiral Ting fonnd
himself forced to surrender Weihaiwel
and his fleet, he committed suicide.
By this courageous step, technically
dying before surrender, he saved his
Immediate family— father, mother, sons
and daughters— from decapitation and
their property from confiscation, the
penalty when a commander surrenders
an imperial fortress. This Is the law.
When in the old days an English
gunner caused the death of a Chinese
by firing a salute from a cannon from
which by oversight the ball had not
been removed, he was seized, tried
and executed. And In 1839, when in
the course of a disturbance with Eng
lish and American sailors at Canton a
Chinese was killed, the authorities de
manded that if tbe guilty person could
not be detected and executed the
whole party should be handed over
for execution. This is the law.
Intention Is never taken Into ac
count. A dollar for a dollar, an eye
for an eye, a life for a life, and all*
for the emperor nnd his representa
tives—this Is the law of China.

Foothills Wine Grapes.
Tbe advantages of the foothills of
Amador oouuty for the cultivation of
wine grapes are not realized as they
ougbt to be. The possibilities ot
this section are very great, and tbey
are bound to be utilized, sooner or
later. Grape land in the valleys
command from Sou to 9100 per acre.
Amador land nan be bought for from
95 to $10 per aore. This difference in
tbe price of land should be an impor
tant factor, and offset any small ad
vantage* in favor of the valleys, if
any snob advantages exist. Let it be
conceded tbat the low land, as a rule,
will yield a heavier crop than the
foothills. As a further offset against
this, tbe foothill grapes have more of
tbe nine making qualities, and conse
quently command a higher price in
tbe market. It is said tbat wine
makerß will give several dollars per
ton more for grapes grown in the
foothills, than tor those raised else
where. Tbe wine is of better quality,
aud is readily saleable at a higher
piice. This tmth is getting to bo
well understood by experts. There
is no danger, therefore that tbe culti
vation ot tbe wine grape will be over
done in soil peculiarly adapted for
tbat industry. Every part of Amador
county, for several miles above and
below tbe main mineral belt, baa a
large area of land tbat might be pro
fitably devoted to this business.
Instead of tbe tendenoy to monopolize
our toot bill lands for stock grazing,
which baa been going on for years and
still continues, tbe drift ought to be
attougly tbe other way. Lands now
devoted to raising of stock should be
used for vineyards and Joioharda,
supporting a large population ot
small farmers and orchard ists.
We are p.leawd to notioe a move in
tbe northern end of tbe county in
tbia direction. Residents in tbe
vicinity of Oleta are taking tbe
matter in baud, believing tbat it pro
mises more than anything else tbat
could be devised to bring tbe possi
bilities ol oar foothills to the trout.
A oonoerted effort all along the line,
showing what baa been done, and can
still be done by a little energy and
- euterprise, would speedily work a
big change for tbe better in tbe horti
cultural situation in this county.
There baa been much unfavorable
comment, on, the action of assembly
man .Suyder in voting for tbe bill to
remore the state capital from Sacra
mento to Berkeley. Representing the
near-by counties of Amador and Cala
veraß—Amador having a large mileage
bordering on Sacramento— tbe un
friendly and unneigbborly vote of
our representative is surprising.
Certainly, be cannot claim tbat be
represents tbe views of his consti
tuents on this subject. The feeling
in Amador is practically unanimous
for tbe oapital to remain where if ia.
We presume the same feeling exists
la Calaveras county and other por
tion* of this assembly district. On a
matter of such' vital importance to
tbe taxpayers, we think Mr Snyder
would bave been wise in taking steps
to feel tbe pulse of his constituents
before easting his vote in the way he
did.
The tight for the oapital removal to
Berkeley is fairly launched. Both
bianches ot tbe legislature hare
passed the bill for removal. It is not
probable that governor Uillett will
«*euuse his veto power. Should be
do so it is likely, from tbe votes
passed in its favor that enough sup
porters oo u ld be mustered to puss it
over his veto. The question must be
settled by the people. We cannot
believe that the legislature reflects
tbe real sentiment of tbe voters in
this momentous issue— by far the most
tremendously important financial pro
blem the people have been called upon
ta unravel for many years. They
rrare nearly two years to consider the
question in all its bearings. Every
phase of it, pro and con, will be
threshed out. We bave an abidiug
faith Id common sense of tbe voters.
They are not fools, notwithstanding
that many of the lawmakers biennially
sent to tbe legislature may safely be
classed in that category. When it is
realized tbat the scheme haa nothing
more substantial to recommend it
than the self-interest of a few real
estate men, and plottings of a gang
ot politioians, it will be voted down,
m it ought to be, on general pnnci-
I»l«t.
l'b« bill was promptly signed by
governor Uillett. The governor is
falling heir to adverse criticism be
cause for this act. We cannot see
bow he could have acted otherwise
under the circumstances. The Jegis
latur* is supposed to represent the
masses of tbe people, and when .th«
bill passed by auch a big majority,
in could uot be expected to inter
pose a veto to prevent the submission
of tbe issue to tbe voters. I'ersanaJ
ly. the governor is said to be strongly
opposed to tbe capital iemoval craze,
•ad will do bis utmost as a citizen
to block tbe scheme.

Tho lone and Kaetern Kailroad has
levied an assessment of $0 per share.
Ihis is a pretty steep levy to hand
out to the stockholders. It is not the
kind of dividend that loomed up
betore those who put their money into
tbe enterprise! when Jit was first
organized. Nevertheless, it is no
doubt designed to pave the way for
those pleasanter dividends which
pour money into the pockets of
fortunate shareholders, instead of
taking coin therefrom. We presume
this assessment is the initial step in
the extension of the road to the tim
ber belt— some twenty-live miles
beyond the present terminus. Every
thing points to the starting of this
work ot extension early this spring,
and that it will be pushed to com
pletion us rapidly as possible. The
promoters have been over the route,
bavo thoroughly looked into tbe tim
ber resources of tho eastern section,
with the result tbat tbey bought out
right a large areß ot tbe timbered
lands, bave secured options on still
more, which options they are taking
up as the time limits are about to
expire The whole thing has a busi
ness like aspect. The present maua
gers of the road realize that tbe rail
road as it now stands is not, and can
not be made a paying enterprise. T,h«
passeDger fare is the same between
the two terminal points as it was in
tbe days of stage coaching; tbe rates
for freight are little if any under the
mountain wagon method ot trans
portation. Still, with the high-grade
tariffs, tbe revenue is not equal to the
payment of a reasonable interest on
tbe investment.
Tbe road as it now stands is unique
in the history of railroading in this
country. We question if there is, or
has been, another road built in the
United States affording a paialiel to
his short-haul line. It vims built for
ordinary freight and passenger traffic
— not a sight-seeing road to be sought
by pleasure-seekers and tourists, but
for commercial purposes in the usual
acceptation of tbat term. And yet
there is not a town nor even a village
or hamlet along the entire route.
There is not a way -station at any
point on the line. For an independent
road, this is certainly a peculiar
condition. Hut this is not all. It
ends nowhere. With tbe largest
town in the county within two miles
of its terminus, the promoters con
cluded to stop even, tbat shmt
distanoe of the heavy tratHo tbat flows
to and from Jaokson. Of course, it
may be said, that it gets this traffic
anyway. True, bat at what cost.
The cost of hauling by team from the
terminus to this city is one-third tbe
cost ot the total freight charges from
lone to Jackson And evep at this
rate, there is nothing in tbe business
for the teamsters.
The road ought to and might have
bridged this two-mile space without
any serious engineering difficulties to
contend with, and therefore without
additional expense outside of ordin
aiy monntain railroading. The cost
ot maiotaining and operating the road
would not bare been increased to any
appreciable extent, while tbe addi
tional freight and passenger charges
would bave proved a vitally import
ant factor in the income of tbe road —
probably made sufficient difference to
plaoe the road on a paying basis.
Tbe chances of lierkeley becoming
the capital are slim. The university
town wiil put up a strong tight, and
spent lots of money in the canvass,
but we do not think tbey can win.
In this year of unparalleled disaster,
tbe legislators committed a piece pt
unpaidonable folly in plunging tbe
state into such a bitter sectional tight
as this capital removal contest pro
mises to be. The proposition, in
ordet to win, must receive a majority
of all the votes oast at tbe next
geueral election. Some authorities
go farther than this, and claim that a
majority of alj the registered voters
will be necessary to take tbe oapital
to Berkeley. Assuming this view tp
be correct there is not the ghost of a
show tor Berkeley to win. The vote
actually polled at a state election
always faljs from 15 to '20 per cent
short of the electors enrolled :upon
the great registers. Tho citizen who
fails to go to the polls on elmctiou
day, as well as tbe ruter who neglect*
to mark his ballot on tbe capital
removal 'issue, will all soore against
Berkeley, just the same as though
they actually voted in favor of Sacra
mento. As a rule, twenty live per
aept of the total vote is enough to
carry nr defeat a constitutional
amendment. A£ the last eleotion the
total vote in Amadoi county was 2409.
And jet the highest vote cast on
either tor or against a constitutional
amendment was 470— less tbau one-
Hitli of the total vote, This fact will
Hiittlw to show the uphUl character ot
tbe job tbat Berkeley has undertaken. I

Another Railroad Scheme.
A A railroad from Stockton to tap the
e extensive timber belt of Cnlaveras
c county is actively promoted, by John
K Kaggioand other uapitaiists. -Experts
h have been over the route, accompanied
b by some of the promoters, and are
m much enthused over the outlook.
T Two surveys have been . run from
V Valley Spring to the timber region,
a a distance of fifty miles. Concerning
t this huge undertaking the Stockton
l lndependent of March sth says :
'The vast scheme ot development,
w which will entail the expenditure of
b between 57,000,000 and 10, .000, 000,
w was promoted by Henry Jiruner, vice
p president of the Central Trust Com-
p pany. A commission, headed- by (J.
( i. i''aget, a well known engineer and
r railroad man of Paris, which repre-
s sented the French capitalists in San
F Francisco, yesterday came to an
a agreement with iiruner. Fagot and
l limner will leave this morning for
P Paris, where the full details of the-
p project will be worked cut. The
c commission has maintained head-
q quarters at the St. Francis hotel.
T The Californians interested jin thei
u undertaking "besides Bruner are:
J John nagglQ, president of the Com-
m mercial and Havings i-Jank of Stock
tton; H. H. Blood, Baa Francisco
c capitalist; Tilden Tcguazzini of the
S Swiss-American Hank; Charles Krriek
s son, a contractor who is building the
B Bay Shore cutoff, and F. J. Solinsky,
a an attorney, The French capitalists
m most heavily interested are former
M Minister of Finance Bouden and
p president Adam of a French banking
s syndicate. The project will be
f financed through the Banque Franco-
A Americaiue of Paris.
The syndicate has already purchased
40,000 anres of timber land in Cala
veras county, inclosing the big trees
now owned by millionaire Whitesido,
and has options on 100,000 additional
acres of timber laud which it will
buy up as necossity requires.
In the 10,000 acres of timber land
already acquired at a cost of $15 an
acre, there 'are said to be one billion
feet of lumber. The plan js to light
the lumber trust in tho Sau Francisco
market. If the plaiis of the syndicate
carry, it will begin rlie delivery ot
the Calaverua lumbar in San ji'ran
cisco with the ilrst of next yeai\
Work on tbe proposed railroad will
begin in April. The Hue will be
built with all hasto in order to afford
an outlet for the lumber from Cala
veiaa. It is rumored that from tbe
forests the line will eventually be ex
tended through Alpine county and the

The levy ot n $9 assessment upon
tbe capital stock of tbe lone and
Eastern rnilioad has created some
talk. While it is. a very heavy load
per share, tho snui total realized is
not large, and will not go tar in mil
road construction work. The sup
position is that the assessment is to
provide money tor extonding the live
to tho timber country. The capital
stock of the corporation is 81 ,000,000,
divided into 10000 sharse of $100 each.
Allowing that the shares are all out
standing, the amount nf n $0 levy will
aggregate 900,000. As the cost of
railroad construction in a mocntnin
ous country such ns we have horo is
ligrjred at from SHO.OOO to Blo,oou per
milo, tlic aiiiniiiit will surUce to build
not more tlinn three milos. It is a
mere in the big undertaking.
It is not likely that tho sum total of
the money lequired to extend the
live will be raised by assessment
upon tho capital" stock. It is only n
assumption, however, thnt the pro
posed extension is the cause ot tho
levy ot this assessment.
The fcil Dorado Kepubiioan rises to
remark that if the California legis
Intors wore either moved up to Fol
som, or down to Stocktun, it would
be a far more beneficial act for the
people of the state at large than mov
ing the capital to lierkeley. We
concur.

A SISTER'S COURAGE.
P Presence of Hind of an ' Ki»hte«*tk
Century Irlßb Woman.
In looking over some family papers
nnd Lmn-lles of old letters I discovered
oue by Mrs. Jeffereys of Blarney cas
tle. County Cork, which contains an
account of a circumstance interesting
In itself as an instauce of heroism on
tho part of the narrator toward her
brother, the Earl of Clare, and so valu
able as bringing to light a remarkable
event connected with the history of
those troubled times that I feel I am
only discharging a duty iv submitting
it to the notice of the editor.
The letter is dated 0 Molesworth
street, Jr.!.--, 1807, and, among other
matters, M.3. Jeffereys writes as fol
lows:
"On the clay Lord Fitzwilliam was
recalled, when my brother (as chancel
lor) was returning from the castle aft
er having assisted at the swearing In
of the newly arrived lord lieutenant, a
ferocious mob of no less than 5,000
men and several hundred women as
sembled together in College green and
all uloiig the avenue leading to my
brother's house. The male part of the
Insurgents were armed with pistols,
cutlasses, sledges, suws, crowbars and
every other weapon necessary to break
open my brother's house, and the wo
men were all of them armed with
their aprons full of paving stones. This
ferocious and furious mob began to
throw showers of stones into my broth
er's coach, at his coachman's head and
his horses. They wounded my brother
in the temple in College green, nnd if
he had not sheltered himself by hold
ing his great square official purse be
fore him he would have been stoned to
death before he arrived (through the
back yard) nt his own house, where
with several smithy sledges they were
working hard to break into his hall
door, while others of them had ropes
ready to fix up to his lamp iron to hang
him the moment they could find him,
when 1 arrived, disguised in my kitch
en maid's dress, my blue apron full ol
stones. I mingled with this numerous
mob and addressed a pale, sickly man,
saying: 'My dear jey'l, what'll become
of hus! I am after running from the
castle to tell yens all that a regiment
of hos is galloping down here to thram
ple hus, etc. Oh, yea, yea, where will
we go?' Then they cried: 'Hurry, hur
ry, the hos Is coming to charge and
thrample hus! Hurry for the custom
house.' Ami in less than a moment the
crowd dispersed.
'"I then procured a surgeon for my
brother and a guard to prevent another
attack, and thus I saved Lord Clare'a
life at the risk of being torn limb from
limb if I had been recognized by any
of the mob."— London Notes and Que
ries.
Oxygen and Mushrooms. ,
■7■: A7 ■: A singular way of removing oxygen
f from the j air by the aid of a plant Is
a as follows: Inside a glass bell Jar, sus-
p pended over water, is placed a mush
rroom, and sunlight is allowed to ; fall
u upon the i plant. | The mushroom ab-
s sorbs the oxygen , from the air in the
j jar, and the carbonic acid formed dur
iing the process is absorbed by the wa
tter, which | gradually . rises in the jar
t to one-fifth ; of , its height. - . The , mush-
r room now dries up, but its animation
i s 'only suspended, as may be proved
b by introducing beside it a green plant,
w when it will recommence to vegetate,
b being nourished by the oxygen exhaled
f from the fresh plant '. .
Hope.
"Mr. Merchant." said the new clerk,
preparing to a.-sk for more money, "I
think I understand the business pretty
■well now, iiml"—
"Yes?" interrupted his employer.
"Well, keep at it four or five years.
Perhaps you'll understand it then as
well us you think you do now."—Phil

George Hambric came up from San

horses. The demand for work horses
ia almost unlimited. They are shipp
ing them in from every part of the
country and still the aupply is not
equal to the demand. Many ot the
horses get sick and die, on account of
the bard work, the climate, and the
constant working in mud. Mr Ham

Chas. UeMolli, walking delegate ot

Angels Camp a few days ago. He is
expected to return to Jackson about
the 15th. According to street talk, a
strike is scheduled for about that
time, to be borne solely byjthe Italian
element, most of whom are not
members of the local union. The
union miners discount the strike
talk, and will have none of it. At
the same time business men are com
plaining of dull times; people are
holding the purse strings pretty
tightly. Tbat is always the result of
labor agitation. Let us hope these
pampered delegates will stay away,
and give the camp a prolonged rest.
That. is certainly the greatest boon
they can bestow upon the laboring
class here.

matter was settled last Saturday by
the payment of something over $300.
The proporty was insured for £500.
it was not a total loss, however, and
the amount paid by the company is

Serious Affray.
A serious scrape occurred on Sutler
hill on Saturday last, between W. E.
Par Eons of this county, who for a
time was running the planing mill
near the old toll house in Jackson,
and a man named James MoGuirk,
who is said to be from Calaveras
county. The quarrel which led up to
the scrap was of the most frivolous
nature. Parsons, it seems, was work
ing on the road on Sutter hill, this
side of the town. Wnile so engaged
McGuirk came along in a\buggy. He
had ovidontly boen drinking. Parsouf
kept on at his work, and as tbo buggy
approached, threw a shovelful of earth
into the roadway iv front ot the
vehicle. It was not done in auv way
to aunoy, but 'merely iv the ordinary
performance of his work. MoGuirk,
howevor, demurred to this proceed
ings, saying, "Don't cover up my
buggy." He Etopped, got out, and
was l^ady for a Hgtit right there.
Other parties, however, interfered,
and prevented an encounter. Parsons
had a shovel and ax with him in bis
road work. He picked them up and
went on aorne distance further up the
hill. McGuirk was bent on a quarrel,
and pioked up the ax, which Parsons
had laid down, and attacked Parsons
savugely. Parsons was armed with
the shovel, and defended himself with
it. Both struck about the same time.
Parsons received a blow with the
edge of the ax across bis right
shoulder, making an ugly gash. Me
Uuirk received the blade of the
shovel in tall force, and was disabled,
dropping his own weapon and fall
ing to the ground. Thereupon Par
sous took up the ax and gave his
antagonist a blow with the edge as
be was in a prostrate or stooping
position. The ax caucht him behind
the left shoui'ler, outting deeply into
the tissue, and through two ribß.
The wound is dnugeroos acd may
prove fatal. Parsons is not seriously
hurt. McGuirk was taken to the
Summit house* where he still remains
under the cure of Dr. Goodman. No
arrests have been made as yet,,
although the officers went over to the
scene on the day of the tight, and
deemed it unnecessary to take legal
steps at that time.

MINING NOTES.
T Bay State.— Reports from this pro
perty, are to the effect that it is look
ing better than at any previous period
in its history." The ore body is of
large rfize,pnd a quality to leave a fair
margin of profit. The mill has not
been started, but will be shortly,
with every prospect of a long and
prosperous career.
Bright.— Thiß property was started
up early this week, for the purpose of
taking the water but, to permit ot a
further investigation by experts from
New York. Three shifts are engaged,
working night and day with three
men on a shift, under the management
of Geo. Tucker. This work is befntf
done by the intending purchasers!'
Samples were taken 'when the pro-,
perty was drained before, and these
assayed very satisfactorily. We are
told that a proposition has been made
§y these parties for the purchase of
the mine, which has been accepted by
Mr Bright. the outlook is very en
couraging tor the development of this
property on a large scale.
Wedded in Greek Church.
The matrimonial event of the week
was the weddiug of M. L. Curilioh of
the Uwin mine to Miss Mary Erboz
of Jackson, which took place in the
Greek church on Thursday morning.
The Rev. Father X TasKovski came
up from San Francisco specially to
perform the ceremony. The church
was well filled with friends of the
contracting parties and others gather
ed to witness the marriage rites
according to the method of the Greek
Orthodox church, the ritual being
quite different from the custom in
fogue iv other denominations. The
bride was attended by Mrs A. Pero
bich as bridesmaid, and L. J. Ulavino
vioh acted as groomsman. Tne bride,
uaturally endowed ■ with personal
attractions far above the ordinary,
looked very pretty, attired in becom
ing white, with a bouquet of carna
tions. The bridesmaid also was very
tastily and becomingly dressed. The
ceremouy was in the Slavonian
tongue. The novel features that
6tiuck the spectators were the employ
ment of two wedding rings — one for
each of the contracting parties; the
crowning of each with a floral wreath,
and the prominence given to thrice
repetitions of portions of the
solemnization. Thus, three time? the
bridal pair ciroled round the table;
three times each kissed the sacred
crucifix aud the holy bible. Three
times the wedding rings were ex
changed, each transferring the ring
to the finger of the other that number
ot times. The novetly of these things
was amusing to some, but the affair
was very impressive as a whole.
The ceremouy over, the b,ridal
couple and their intimate friends re
paired to the residence of S. Savicb
on Kruauway, where a sumptuous
wedding feast was partaken of. About
twenty sat down tv the feast. It was
gotten up regardless of expense by
Mrs Frank Simcich ana a corps of
assistants, and thoroughly enjoyed by
the assembled guests.
The newly-married pair will make
their home at the Uwin mine.- Mr
Cuiilich has been an employe of the
mining company there for several
years, in a responsible position on
the surface. The bride is recently
from her native land, Austria, having
arrived here about three months ago.
The well-wishes of a host of friends
go with them for a long and happy
matrimonial life.

FRAUDS IN OLD BOOKS.
Ancient and Rare Volume* Doctored
He&tored and Imitated.
A well known collector acquired
what he took to be a book riubUshed
by Aldus in the year 14S0. He paid
; $1,000, f0r it and believed that it was
I an original Aldus, because the publish
\ er's press mark, a dolphin coiled round
jan anchor, appeared upon it. When
j the book was shown to an expert It
proved to be beyond a shadow of
doubt • modern antique— that is to
say. it was simnly a copy of the orig
inal work printed by an ingenious book
I fakir. So clover was the imitation
I that only an expert could tell it from
' the original and rare book. Scores of
i persons during recent years have
1 bought facsimiles of rare works under
; the Impression that they were getting
| the originals. Dickens' "Sunday TJn
! der Three Heads" has been faked
many times and sold as original to
! collectors who no doubt treasure them
!as rarities. Genuine copies of this
little book are worth a good sum, aud
! some unscrupulous dealers, taking ad
: vantage of the circumstances, have
bad it reprinted aud palm off the
copies on unsuspecting bibliomaniacs
for the genuine lirst edition.
Many men make a living by "doc
toring" old and' nm> books for un
scrupulous dealers. These men are
adepts In the art of book restoring aud
are quite able to make good any part
of an imperfect copy. For, instance,
if a rare book has a lent missing it is
handed over to a restorer, who re
prints the page with battered itype,
| the paper upon which it is printed be
i Ing afterward discolored with chem
i lcals or tobacco water In order to give
i it the true antique hue.
The first folio Shakespeare is, of
course, of great value, and it is safe
to say that every possible deception
has been practiced in fitting up copies
i of this work for sale. At one time the
j manufacture of first folio Shakespeares
j was quito a trade. A first folio having
several leaves missing had leaves in
serted from the second folio, while In
one case the entire piny of "Cymbe
line" was reprinted and inserted In a
first folio. The "faked" pages were
so cleverly done that several experts
were at first unable to detect them
when turning over tho pages of the
work in question. Book restorers, as
a rule, are most Ingenious artists, and
they can produce an Imitation of a
puge of a rare book which will deceive
hundreds of collectors. One particu
lar restorer has' "doctored" more than
a thousand old books during the laat
two years, producing pages Iv facsim
ile and supplying colophons or deco
rated papitals. There Is not a thing
wanting to make a book complete that
this mnn cannot skillfully "fake."—

place of Sir Philip Sidney. Under the
trees of its park Edmund Waller paid
his addresses to the haughty Lady
Dorothea, whom he celebrated as Such
arissa. But the heart of Lady Dorothea
Sidney — who was the most beautiful
woman of her time— was untouched by
VTaller's amatory verses, and she re
jected the poet in favor of the Earl of
Sunderland. Many year, afterward the
countess met Waller and, reminding
him sentimentally of the old days at
Penhurst, asked him when he would
again -write verses about her. "When,

as young and as handsome as you were
then."

WAGER OF BATTLE.
Ifcj' First Duclk Are Said to llara
lieen Penglit Iv ituly.
The first duels were Fought in Italy,
according to Millingcn, who speaka of
a manuscript discovered at Cassel and
describes a duel between a lather and
a son in the reign of the Emperor The
odoric. When Charlemagne Forbade
wager of battle among ihe Uombards
he encountered the fiercest opposition
from tbe nol>lo3. Early in the ninth
century De SCedlcia, a knight defeated
in shurle combat the bandit Mugel,
who devastated the Florentine district
now called after him. Mugello. Otho
11. granted the prayer of the nobility
for tin' re-estabUabment of wager of
battle iv i)SS. Women and priests
wore not compelled to accept it. The
Normans showed less gallantry. With
them a woman had to accept, nor could
she name a champion. Her male op
ponent, however, was buried to his
waist in the earth. Armed with a
club, he tried to strike her as she cir
cled around htm, his weapon being *a
ball of irou at the end of a cord. If he
failed to touch her at the third at
tempt he was vanquished, which
meant to him death with dishonor.
Beccarin says that the reason so
many duels were fought in Italy in
the early days is that whore the law
does not afford protection one must
look to single combat to retain the re
spect of one's fellow men. In the mid
dle ages the ferocity of Italian duels
passes belief. "Any way of putting an
enemy to death ("ogni modo') is good
enough," says one of their writers.
"When an Italian spares his vanquish
ed adversary," says Brnntome, "he
maims his arms and legs and gives
him as a memento of his kindness and
generosity a hideous gash across the
face." Lampagnano practiced on a
painted model of Galeazzo Sforza be
fore he stabbed him. Dueling was
called "la scienza cavalleivsca." — Corn

DRINK MORE, EAT LESS.
Advice For Those With Rhcnmntlnm,
Goat, Eczema and \i':irnlyria.
If people r.ould take lejs nutrition
and drink more water, there would be
less rheumatism, gout, eczema and
neuralgia in the world. The most fre
quent cause of these derangements is
an excess of nutritive materials. The
blood is surcharged with salts that
are not needed in the system.
The doctors are trying to remedy
these diseases by giving something to
eliminate the salts, such as purgatives,
diuretics and solvents of various
kinds. The rational way, however, to
cure such affections Is to stop the
cause. Drink more water; eat less
meat and concentrated foods. This
shuts off the supply of urates in the
blood.
Those who take active exercise In
tbe open air every day require a great
er ' amount of nutrition. Xot only do
they use up the nutritive materials in
muscular exercise, but the amount of
oxygen inhaled because of their activ
ities thoroughly oxidizes the urates aud
changes them in urea. If the blood is
londed with urates they are very like
ly to crystallize, especially in those
portions of the body where tbe circula
tion is the least aud the temperature
is the lowest, such as the elbows, an
kles, the toes and fingers.
Drink more water; eat less food.
This is a prescription that is worth
more to such people than all the drugs
in the world. Shut off the source of
urate poisoning and the effects of
urate poisoning will disappear.—Ex
change.
The Gentlemanly Leopard.
The cheetah has a reputation as one
of the most gentlemanly of beasts. A
story from Ootacamund shows what
flue manners the animal h»s. Three
Calcutta visitors to tho hill station
Were out on a tramp when they were
overtaken by a thunderstorm, accom
panied by sheets of rain. They spied a
cave in the side of the hill, aud into it
they rushed. When the rain stopped
they came out and, to their surprise,
found a cheetah sitting licking the
heavy wet off his waistcoat and his
paws. It was his cave, but rather than
deprive his visitors of their shelter the
polite creature had sat outside in the
driving tempest. With a friendly mew
and gracefully wagging his tail, the
cheetah bade adieu to his guests and
walked with dignity into his house.—

Bow to Sneered In Literature.
The qualities which I consider most
conducive to success in literature are
Imagination, coupled with a great
knowledge of the world, concentration,
the willingness and ability to work
hard, a considerable knowledge of
business and a firm determinati6n to
ignore the instructions of literary and
other agents with regard to what the
reading public may be supposed to re
quire. If any author once loses his in
dependence in writing he may be call
ed finished, so far as any career is In
question.— John Oliver Hobbes.

"hill- anil Hot Bath*.
Hot water bathing is beneficial in
counteracting the effect of a chill.
"First, it undoes another mischief work
ed by the chin. The latter has sent too
much blood internally, so risking con
gestion. Heat brines the blood to the
surface. Heat is not life, but it is
one of the fat-tors of life. Indeed, dis
solution always occurs when the in
ternal bodily temperature is greatly
lowered. Heat will not keep a body
alive and great beat will kill it. In
many morbid states of the system, as
rheumatism, hot baths arc of great
service. Warm baths are useless. The
heat should be as great as can be
borne without pain.
THE DEVILFISH.
Its Ability to Cfcsuur* Its Orm and
the Water*a Color.
"I was lying on a rock watching the
movements of some land crabs which
kept retreating frou. the water as the
tide rose, when suddenly a crab dashed
frantically from the water, and out
after it galloped — there is no other
word for it— a devilfish nearly two feet
across," writes an observer from Ava
lon. Cal. "The nnlmal continued the
chase a short distance, lifting Its ten
tacles iv the air in a sort of overhead
motion; then, finding pursuit hopeless,
It withdrew with a peculiarly unpleas
ant, writhing, gliding motion charac
teristic of these animals. Upon reach-
Ing the water it stationed Itself just at
the edge, so mimicking tbe color of the
bottom that when I glanced away and
looked suddenly back I could not at
once distinguish it. This devilfish had
the appearance of a cat watching for
mice, and when a crab was seen It
would shoot out a long, attenuated
tentacle, and attempt to seize it. By
carefully insinuating my way to the
water's edge I quickly graspod the
specimen and after a short struggle
tore It from the rocks and secured It.
"At various times I had from three
to five devilfishes in an inelosure
where I could watch them change color
and tost their strength. In confine
ment, if the tank bottom was dark,
they assumed various tints, generally
a dark reddish brown, but the largest
one was a tigcrllke creature, about
three feet across, with a ground of
livid white covered with black or dark
gray blotches, giving It a truly fiendish
appearance, especially as the eyes
were conspicuous and appeared to emit
lambent gleams. The change of color
was marvelous in its rapidity. In a
special tank in which two of these
prisoners were confined they occupied
the corners, facing outward, with arms
either coiled under or above them. At
any offensive movement on my part,
presenting my hand under water, the
color scheme would change. A blush
appeared to pass over the entire sur
face, and in a large squid I can only
compare it to heat lightning— a rapid
and continued series of flushing and
paling, from deep brick red to gray.
"It was very evident that the ani
mals differed much In pugnacity.
Some did not resent my touching them;
others merely threw a tentacle in my
direction, while one never touched me,
but directed Its siphon at my hand
under water and sent a violent current
In that direction, apparently endeavor
ing to blow my hand away. It was
fascinating to observe the range this
water gun had and how by seeming
Intuition the devilfish could direct it
at my hand as I slowly moved It about
while attempting to attract the ani
mal's attention In an opposite direc
tion."

W When Hoops Began.
When were hoops "in" for the first
jtime? According to Strutt, "trundling
the hoop is a pastime of uncertain or
igin, but much in fashion at present"
(1801). Dr. Murray's dictionary, inci
dentally remarking that the original
hoop affected by boys was a barrel
hoop, gives no English reference to it
earlier than 1792. But the hoop was
well known to ancient Greek and Ro
man boys, who called it a "trochus"
(wheel). Their hoops were made of
bronze, and representations of them on
gems show that they were driven by a
little hook with a wooden handle, very
like the modern boy's hoop stick. This
was called by the Greeks "elater"
(drivfer) and by the Romans "clavis"
(key). Sometimes the ancient hoop had
bells attached to It, and modern Lon
don may be glad to be spared at least
that exasperation.— London Chronicle.
Unfortunate Omission.
One of the most singular instances of
punishment for an oversight was that
shown by the commitment of an alma
nac maker to the Bastille in 1717. It
was made out by order of the Duke of
Orleans, regent during the minority of
Louis V. of France, and read as fol
lows: "Laurence d'Henry, for disre
spect to King George I. In not mention
ing him in his almanac aa king of
Great Britain." How long this un
lucky almanac maker remained in pris
on is unknown. The register of the
Bastille, examined at the time of the
revolution, failed to throw any light on
the subject.

THE CURSE OF INDIA
CASTE, WHICH FIXES THE STATUS
OF EVERY HINDOO.
Ko Man Can Rise Prom the Class,
However Vnoli-r.ii, In Which He
Wa» Born— Neither Wealth Nor Suc
cess Affects the Caste ot Any One.
In the fixed scale of descent in. India
some classes are merely inferior, while
some are "unclean" or "untouchable,"
but from whatsoever class a man be
born in he has no escape but death.
Children born In an "unclean" caste
remain "unclean;" children born in an
Inferior caste remain as their fathers
were. Nothing that they can do can
in the slightest degree change their
situation. They were born "unclean;"
their ancestors were "unclean;" thei
descendants will be "unclean" till tl
end of the chapter.
To give a few illustrations fn
many, a weaver is less "unclean" tlu. .
a carpenter, a carpenter is above n
bouse cleaner, a house cleaner is above
a street cleaner, and a street cleaner Is
above a pariah or no caste man. Every
trade or occupation has its exact place,
arbitrarily fixed, in the scale of degra
dation.
Above all the men that labor with
their bands In whatsoever way are
the tradesmen and shopkeepers, also
with subdivisions Into classes; above
the tradesmen is the useless and now
almost Idle warrior class; above the
warriors Is the Brahman or priestly
class, and with these grand divisions
the structure of the system is com
plete.
Wealth or material situation or suc
cess has nothing to do with the caste of
any man. You may hire for your cook
or valet a Brahman of the purest strain
serene, who for weeks before you eu->
gaged him may have been on tho verge
of starvation. The meager beggar to
whom yqu toss alms in the road mny
be of a very high caste. The well fed
groom, resplendent in gorgeous livery,
flashing by on a carriage that covers
the beggar with dust, is very likely of
a caste a mile below tbe beggar. Time
no more than effort can break down
these walls of division. One of the
wealthiest aud most distinguished fam
ilies In Calcutta, the famous Tagore
family, lost caste about two centuries
ago. Members of this family have re
ceived honor from the government,
have conferred great benefits upon city
and country and have been noted for
their numerous charities and benefac
tions. One exerted himself all his life
to further native education. Another
helped to endow Calcutta university.
All are enormously rteh, aud all bear
enviable reputations for goodness, hon
esty and philanthropy. But the wall of
caste has never fallen for them. They
are still hated "and avoided by their
countrymen exactly as they were at
the beginning of their exclusion. In tbe
streets of Calcutta is many a ragged
artisan that would not sit on the same
bench with a Tagore or touch the end
of his robe.
Pain, suffering, penury, even death
Itself, is nothing tq the Hindoo, com
pared with the toss of caste. Many a
Hindoo that In the old days would
yield nothing to the most fiendish tor
tures quickly surrendered his secrets
when threatened with something that
would contaminate him— a piece of
cowskln, perhaps, or a glass of water
that had been touched by a pariah. In,
I suppose, thousands of cases persons
that hare hope.les.sly lost their «aste
have abapdQned their homes and wan
dered miserably along tbe roads until
death overtook them. Thousands of
others have thrown themselves into the
Ganges or deliberately starved.

the others also, her eldest son Imme
diately swallowed poison and died,
and his" remaining brethren fled tbe
country.
A husband shares a wife's degrada
tion. A wife goes down the steps with

a Brahman family of Santlpur has
been outcaste because one member fell
in love with the daughter of a shoe
maker.—Charles Edward Russell in
