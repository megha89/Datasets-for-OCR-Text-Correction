Mow Indian Tribesmen. Succeed In
Escaping the Police.
Some of the Indian tribes over which
we rule give us a great deal of trouble,
notably the Mahsuds. The Mahsuds,
however, are not by any means the
worst of the Indian robber tribes, the
unenviable distinction probably falling
to the Bhils, who ] are ; the cleverest
scoundrels in; the ; world, 1 both in their
methods of acquiring, other . people's
property and in evading pursuit
• They are very proud of their skill in
pilfering and openly, boast of.it One
of them once told a British officer that
he could steal the blanket from nnder
him and was ; promptly challenged to
show his ability. That night when the
officer was fast asleep the Bhll robber
cut a hole in his tent, crept noiselessly
in and gently tickled the hands and
feet of the sleeping man. " The
stirred uneasily and- turned over.'. .'ln
this way the Bhil was able to pull the
blanket out a little way. By repeating
his performance he finally* succeeded
in "coaxing" the blanket completely
from under the sleeper.
When engaged in his nefarious. little
games," the Bhil wears hardly * any
clothing, and his lithe body is rubbed
with oil to facilitate escape from any
would be captors. When hotly pursued
by the British troops, the robbers make
use of a very clever device. They con
ceal their scant clothing under their
small round shields and scatter them
about to resemble stones or bowlders;
then, picking up a few twigs— if there
are any to be had— they • assume j all
sorts of grotesque attitudes, their al
most fleshless limbs silhouetted against
the dark night sky closely resembling
the charred limbs of a tree. Absolute
ly motionless, they hold their positions
till the enemy has passed them.
In this way a British subaltern in
charge of a party sent to capture some
Bhils was considerably startled one
evening. The pursuit had completely
lost sight of the robbers, and finally
the party drew rein by a clump of
gnarled and bent tree trunks, tired and
hot from their hard exertions. The of
ficer in charge took off his hat and
placed it on the end of a broken limb,
when instantly there was a wild scream
of laughter, and the tree trunks sud
denly came to life and vanished in the
darkness.— London Express.

"What is that for?" asked the judge.
"For contempt, your honor," was the
reply.
"But I didn't fine you for contempt,"
answered the Judge.' "There must be
some mistake." ■
"Oh. no, there isn't," replied the old
man. "I have cherished a secret con

.MAKING BONELESS HAMS.
Housekeepers Mar I>o It as 'Well as m
Professional Batcher.
Little though one may think, the
process of making a boneless bam is
quite a fine art and one that require*
no small degree of skill in tbe under
taking. In fact, . it Is not every one
who can "bone" a ham successfully.
In the event a housekeeper unfamiliar
with the art ' of removing the bone
from hams were to undertake the job
she would be almost certain to begin
operations by first of all splitting the
bam open and endeavoring to carve out
the bone by cutting around It The re
sult would be failure and vexation of
the worst sort, to say nothing of a ruin
ed ham. The proper way to remove
the bone would never suggest Itself to
the average housekeeper. '
The operator stands the ham on end
■gainst a supporting block' and pro
ceeds to carve around the : bone from
one end as deep as It Is possible for
him to run his hand and knife down
into the flesh and around the bone.
Having reached tbe extreme limit (as
far, in fact, as it is possible to extend
the knife), he. reverses the ham and
begins cutting around | the bone from
the other end, cutting downward until
he reaches the point that be attained
in cutting from the end on which he
began, the entire operation being sci
entifically correct and on the principle
of skinning an animal. Tbe bone then
slips out clear and smooth, free from
any adhering flesh.
As soon as this is done stout twine is
wrapped around the ham and drawn
taut, completely closing the aperture
left by the removal of the bone. The
twine is thus made fast and the ham
laid away for a day or two, at the end
of which time the., hole has closed so
neatly that. In slicing the ham, it is
difficult to determine the exact spot
from which the bone was removed.
This is the proper mode of making
boneless . ham, and with a little prac
tice any housekeeper can learn to do
the work as well as a professional
butcher. They will observe that first
of all the bone is surrounded by a tis
sue, and by starting the operation from
the ends they will be surprised with
what facility this tissue, dividing the
bone from the flesh, peels loose from
the former.
A CURE AND A FEE.
Peculiar Experience of a Doctor
With a Bnalneaa Man.
In conversation one day about the
peculiar views that commercial men
sometimes entertain about professional
services Dr. S. Weir Mitchell told tno
following story: *
"A very wealthy man from the west
came to consult me about an attack of
vertigo. lie said that he had Just re
turned from a trip to Europe, where
he had consulted eminent specialists,,
but that they had failed to"affor4 him
any permanent relief. 'A physician in
London,' be said, 'asked me why I did
not make an attempt to be cured near
er home. I thought on my way out
west 1 would stop over to see you.'
" 'Has any physician you have visit
ed looked into your ears?' I asked.
" 'No,' was his reply.
"I made an examination, of his ears,
removed some wax and a substance
that appeared to be hardened remnants
of cotton wool. I sent him away then
and told him to come again in a day
or two. He did so.
" 'Well,' he exclaimed, 'I am cured.
How much do I owe you?
. " 'About $50,' I replied.
"As he drew a check 1 he asked, 'Did
you know when you first examined my
cars that you could cure me?'
"When I told him that I had a very
fair conviction that I could, he said:
'Well, you are a blanked fool. You
should have said to me: "I think 1 can
cure you, and I will do so for $10,000.'
No cure, no pay." You would have
got your money without a murmur.'
- "'Oh,' I said, 'if you feel that way
about it there are several little chari
ties in which I am interested, and'—
" 'No, no,' he interrupted, that Is not
business. I have my cure, and you
have the price you asked. The trans
action is closed.'"' • .
Braas In England. ln Chaucer's Time.

known in England as "rnaslin" as early
as the time of Chaucer, and in the
reign of Henry VTIL an act of parlia

port of brass out of England. Whether
the earlier monumental brasses still to
be found in our churches were made
originally in England Is not absolutely
certain, the probability, according to
some antiquaries, being that they were

FEED BABY SLOWLY.
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FAC
TORS IN CHILD BEARING. •
Reaaona Why Food Should Not Be
Tumbled Rapidly Into the Little
Stomach— Advice Which Apnllea to
Grown Folka ai Well ait Uu'uea.
. In the proper bringing up of a child
there is nothing absolutely more im
portant than this one thing— to teac:.
It to eat slowly. • , ; '. •■ .
Every groom knows and observes the
rule in tho care of a uorse that rapid
eating is futal to digestion. There are
all sorts of pateut mangers to prevent
the horse swallowing his oats too
quickly. The man who bus no patent
manser knows enough, when..neces
sary, to put a stone in the manger,
scattering the oats around it, so Unit
the horse may be compelled to eat
slowly. . If the horse's inclination is
to gulp down water too fast, the care
ful man will put a big sponge in the
water, compelling slow drinking.
A child's appetite, when he is al
lowed to eat rapidly, is always in ex
cess of his actual needs unless the
child is In bad health. The reason for
this is extremely simple. The child
craves food because his body requires
to manufacture new tissue. He is
growing, and he must not only replace
the used np tissues that his daily life
destroys, but he must make new flesh,
new muscles, new bone and new blood
every day, adding weight and size.
The sensation of hunger is not the
craving of an empty stomach, satisfied
as soon as the stomach is filled; it is a
craving that Is felt by the nerves all
over the body. This craving cannot
possibly be saUsfied until the stomach
has begun the work of transforming
the food into blood, flesh, muscles, etc.;
consequently the sensation which we
call hunger persists long after the
child or grown person has rapidly ab
sorbed as much food as it really needs.
A million foolish parents urge their
children to eat a great deal and always
let them eat as much as they want to.
Yet all of these know that a famished
man taken off a wreck will eat himself
to death if allowed to do so. The very
hungry child goes to the same excess,
only in a lesser degree. The great
safeguard against that excess in eat
ing, which kills 00 per cent of men be
fore their time and which accounts for
09 per cent of children's diseases, is
slow eating.
Nearly : all children eat too rapidly.
They do so by nature. Slow eating is
a matter of education. But too often
the mother or the nurse teaches the
child the habit of eating fast When
the baby is little, it is fed one spoonful
at a time. Before it has time to half
chew or even gulp down the first tea
spoonful of food another is held to its
lips. Of. course it swallows what it
has 'in its mouth and seizes upon the
next mouthful. The habit thus incul
cated by foolish adults often ruins the
child permanently.
Four factors count in the healthy as
similation of food, factors which par
ents and nurses should remember. As
suming the food to be properly prepar
ed, thoroughly cooked and wisely se
lected, there comes, first, the work of
the teeth, which prepare the food for
easy digestion; second, the- action of
the saliva, with which the food must
be thoroughly mixed in order to mini
mize the necessary work of the gastric
juices In tho stomach; third, the work
of the stomach itself; fourth, and most
important, a proper supply of blood
and of heat
Force your child to chew slowly and
thoroughly every . mouthful. If noth
ing else will do, compel him at fre
quent intervals to lay down his knife
and fork that the Importance of pro
longed chewing may be impressed upon
him. Don't allow your child to gulp
down water or any other liquid with
his solid food. If you allow him to
drink while he eats, the salivary
glands will not act They will not
need to act, for he will be able to swal
low his food easily when it is made
moist by water.
You can't do anything to help along
the unconscious process .which goes
on in the stomach, but you can do ev
erything to help that process by at
tending to the fourth necessity, which
demands blood and the heat of the
blood in the stomach. Allow no child
After eating to take violent exercise,
to study or even to read an exciting
book. The brain has first call upon
the service of the heart, and as soon
as the brain is excited the blood leaves
the stomach and goes to the head. The
muscles also when too violenUy ex
erted draw the blood away from the
stomach.
It is absolutely impossible for a child
or a grown person to digest properly
or to get strength and vitality from
what he eats unless for at least a half
hour after eating the stomach be al
lowed to monopolize the blood supply.
Children should be kept quiet in
Borne way, especially very young chil
dren, after they have eaten. In the
case of very young babies nature at
tends to this mercifully by making
them go to sleep as soon as they have
absorbed their milk. Older children
ought not to go to sleep directly after
eating for physiological reasons which
may be explained at some other time;
but they ought to be quiet and calm.
Tens of thousands of children in homes
where this newspaper is read are ruin
ed in health by studying right after
meals. The public school system
which gives children too short a rest
ing period in the middle of the day is
responsible partly for this, and the
home studies at night are also respon
sible.
Every word that Is said here applies
to grownup people, of whom not one
in a hundred has ever been taught to
apply to himself such common sense
care. as is bestowed on a second class
horse.— New York Journal.

CURIOSITIES OF MICA.
Its Appearance Before It Is . SplM
Into Sheets.
The mica as it comes from the mluei
is In blocks which , are theoretically
short rhombic prisms, but practically
are scarcely recognizable as sach, hav
ing a very rough and uneven contour.
They 'have v very perfect cleavage
pnrallel to the base and may be splU
into laiulum thinner than the thinnest
tissue paper, and these lamina? form
the • familiar transparent stove panes
end lump chimneys. .The exterior por
tions of these blocks are opaque, brittle
and worthless, presumably from the
penetration of water, for mica soon
decomposes when exposed to any con
siderable v weathering. A thick tayet
of plntes lias therefore to be removed
from cither face of the blocks lwfore
any mica of commercial size or value
is reached, and the sheets split from
the remainder are surrounded by a
wide margin of worthless material. •
But the difficulties and losses of
mica j mining are far from being - all
fcinirnerutod.- Even when occurring in
blocks of , commercial size it is ren
dered "valueless, or comparatively so,
by one or more of a series of defects,
which may be classed as color, specks,
ruling, ribbing and wedge formation.
It sometimes occurs literally pied with
black dots, consisting in' general of
bluek oxide of iron or garnet, and
when even a few of these are present
its commercial value is destroyed, be
cause such mica when used as an Insu
lator Is peculiarly liable to puncture,
the specks forming practically short
.circuits for the electric current The
"same is true of streaks, which are
sometimes turned to red rust. .
Some otherwise excellent mica is
found to be ruled or cut as it were,
with a series of perfectly strnißht
lines, parallel to one side of the crys
tal, so that on being split the mica
falls immediately into strips; or. again,
instead of being striped or ruled, tin
mica is often deeply ribbed or corr.i
gated parallel to the adjacent edges of
the crystal, so as to give the appear
ance of the -letter A, or,' rather. V.
whence it Is termed "A mica." As the
ribbed portion has to be cut away in
the sheet, such mica is unprofitable
unless the blocks be large. Wedge
mica is that in which the block is
thicker nt one end^ than the other, the
lamime partaking in the uneveiiness.
Such blocks are wholly worthless ex
cept as scrap.— Engineering Magazine.

Took the Hint.
A story is told of a certain English
bishop well known for his verbosity
who rose to address the house of lords
on a very important occasion. "I will
divide my speech under twelve heads,"
be said, to the discomfort of bis audi
ence. ■
The Marquis of Salisbury begged to
be allowed to interpose with a little
anecdote. "A friend of mine was re
turning borne late one night," be said,
"when opposite St.' Paul's he saw an
intoxicated man trying to ascertain tho
time on the big clock there. Just then
it began to strike and slowly tolled out
12. The man listened, looked hard at
the clock and said: 'Confound you, why
couldn't you have said that all at
once?" 1
The bishop heartily joined in tbe
laughter which followed and took tbe
hint contained'ln tbe story.

HUMAN HEAD HUNTERS.
»he Savm*e* of Polynesia StlU Ply
This Horrible Trade.
In the scarce known islands of the
Pacific sea — New Guinea, Borneo,
Ceram, Gilolo and others too numer
ous to mention— man still exists In the
primeval state, and that most horrible
of practices, head hunting, is still in
dulged in in spite of all efforts of vari
ous governments and missions as well
as ' philanthropic societies who have
come in contact with the people.
Just as the scalp lock on the belt of
the young buck Indian was a token of
manhood, so the gory bead impaled on
a tall pole over the hut of the would be
young warrior, Papuan or Dayak, pro
claims to all the prowess of the youth,
henceforth a man and eligible for the
council and the' wooing of the maidens.
It is immaterial how the trophy be ob
tained, whether by ambuscade or In
fair battle. Generally it is the former.
The candidate for martial honors sim
ply waits his chance by night in some
neighboring village as craftily and pa
tiently as a leopard on the prowl, the
kris or a poisoned arrow does the -work
swiftly and silently, and the severed
head has ample time to cool before the
deed is discovered and calls for retri
bution.
Thus an Incessant vendetta and car
nage go on, and only by Irving In in
accessible forests and strongly stock
aded places is It possible at all for
the tribes to save themselves from an
nihilation. Of the vast island conti
nent of New Guinea the western or
Dutch part is the worst looked after,
and it often happens tthatt t numerous
raiding parties in their great war ca
noes come swooping down the coast
before the northwest monsoon and
carry death and desolation into the
comparatively quiet British portion
around the mighty Fly river, opposite
Torres strait By the tune the news
Is carried to Thursday island and the
gunboat starts away in pursuit it is
generally too late, and the marauders
have vanished. ,'( h
The writer was present once at the
capture of a war party, and forty
eight heads were taken from the ca
noes. . Hanging and deportation to pe-.
nal servitude seem to be but a slight
deterrent, for the terror recurs almost
as regularly as a plague of locusts.
These Papuans are a hardy, warlike
people and expert bowmen, and they
rely on their skill with this potent
weapon solely, using their, dubs for
the dispatch of wounded foes.
The Dayaks of Borneo and their
neighbors, on the other hand, are in
favor of the "sumpltan" or blowpipe,
shooting little diminutive but very cun
ningly poisoned arrows. The "Bumpi
tan" has often a spear head attached
to the outer end, like a bayonet on a
musket For cloße fighting they rely
on the dreaded "parang," a heavy, hol
low ground broadsword about two feet
long, with ; he handle often carved of
ivory and ornamented with gold and
pearls, the wooden scabbard covered
with human skin and hair.'*
They count him a poor warrior who
cannot sever a head clean with one
blow delivered backhanded. Even In a
mountainous part of the Malay penin
sula, north of Malacca, la the Dind

Origin of the Sabbath.
The Sabbath as a religious Institu
tion is far older than the Pentateuchal
legislation. It, tod, can be traced back
to a Babylonian prototype, not; how
ever, as a day of rest from labor, but
as a kind of atonement day, when by.
various rites and by observing cer
tain restricted regulations the anger,
of the gods could be appeased. On
this old Institution the Hebrews in- 1
grafted their religious ideas and- pro
duced the unique Institution of a day
observed as a respite from the week's
toll and which, from being an "inaus
picious" occasion, a dies irse, is viewed
as a "delight"— Professor Jastrow in

HER FACE HER FORTUNE.
Why One Ctrl. Got • Good Paying
and Kmy Position.
She was a sweet looking girl, with as
fair a pink and white complexion as
woman ever desired, and was chatting
with one of her own sex on a Staten
Island ferryboat, while I was seated
so near that I could not help hearing.
Several times my truant eyes deserted
my paper and stole a glance at the
face that was so attractive.
"It. was the luckiest thing that ever
happened to me," she said to her com
panion, : "when I went Into that Fifth
avenue store Just to buy a comb. How
little I thought that I would be work-
Ing there at greater wages than I had
ever hoped to earn! I, hesitated about
going In, because I feared the prices
would be too high, but I did go in and
came out with a comb without paying
a cent for it And, better than all, I
had been engaged to begin the next
Monday as a saleswoman.
"I was nearly discouraged before
that, for I was getting only $4 a week,
and we were awfully pinched at borne,
but my luck changed on that day, and
it was Friday too. Fortunately for me,
the store was crowded when I went in,
and the proprietor left his desk that
stands in a little railed off corner and
came to wait on me. I noticed that he
looked very sharply at me, but not at
all in an Impudent manner.
• "'Pardon me, miss,* he said, Trot' I
am looking for a young lady to assist
me in the store here, and if your cir
cumstances are such that you would
care for the place I would like to have
you consider It'
"I was wonderfully surprised, but
thanked him, saying that I knew noth
ing about the business.
" That doesn't matter,' he replied.
'You can soon learn it To be, frank, I
would like to have you on account of
your complexion. Sou know we sell
all sorts of goods for the complexion
and articles for beautifying, and your
face would do more to make sales than
all of the arguments and representa
tions that could be made.'
"Well, the result was that I got a
fine place, with easy work, at $15 a
week. My hours are short, and I sim
ply, play the agreeable while selling
goods at an immense profit I wouldn't
let any of the concoctions touch my
face for anything, but the customers
appear . to be impressed by my com
plexion, and the proprietor Is satisfied.
So am I."— New York Herald.

A' close, un ventilated house is em

Ground or crushed bone is | a good
form in which to give lime. ,
The nests should be arranged so that
the fowls can walk in on them.
Bran is a better feed for fowls than
corn because it contains more nitrogen.
An excellent feed for young chicks is
cracked or coarsely ground wheat for
the first week.
A cock that fights and picks, his
mates every time they are fed is not
a good breeder, and few of his hens'
eggs will ever hatch.
Cane or sorghum seed can be fed to
fowls to good advantage.' It stimu
lates egg production and in many waya
is good to use for variety. •
For a good breeder select a rooster
with plump, full breast, broad across
the back, wide between the legs and
that crows often, loud and long.
It is a good plan to mate up the
fowls early, for occasionally one of the
hens will want to sit during the win
ter, and it will be best to have the eggs
ready. .
Pig For Harrlage Fee.
"A Lutheran minister in a western
Maryland town j told me an amusing
story the other day," said a gentleman
to a reporter. "Some time ago as thte
minister was walking along a street of
the town an old German advanced to
ward him with extended band. The
minister shook bonds, but remarked
that he could not recall his name. 'Oh,
yes,' said the old German, 'you remem
ber meT I am the man who gave you
a pig when you married me.'
"The minister smiled as he recalled
the incident, and as he was about to
ask about the wife the old German
said: 'Now I tell you what I'll do.
When you married me, I gave you *
pig, so I'll give you two pigs if you
now unmarry me.' "—Baltimore Sun.
Looking Out For Papa.
A sweet little moid of four years was
distressed the other evening because
her father did not come .home to dinner
on time. Her grownup sister said o
her: I
"Papa is naughty, and when he
comes we won't give him any tea."
When he did come, the sister sent the
teapot out to the kitchen for fresh tea.
The baby looked on with a troubled
face and stole softly to her own room.
Shortly she returned with something
squeezed up in her tiny fist Going up
to her Bister, she whispered:
"Annie, I'll give you all my pennies
If you'll give papa his tea."
And, opening her hand, she displayed
all her carefully hoarded pennies.—

RIDICULOUSLY EXAGGERATED.
Story of Sickness, Death and Famine in
the Garaventa Family.
An article appeared in the San Fran
cisco Examiner of the 13th inst. giving
a harrowing story of -the lamentable
condition of the Garaventa family of .
Middle Bar, during the early part of
their siege of diphtheria— a story of
isolation, sickness, famine ,and death.
The fact •of the matter is, the whole
thing was exaggerated to the extent of
being little less than a pure fabrication,
a fact substantiated by the nurse, Mr.
Clark, who called on us this week. It
is true every member of the family was
stricken with the dreaded malady, but
as in all instances of the first appear
ance of an epidemic in a sparsely set
tled locality, the people were taken
unawares and unprepared to contend
with it. In the first appearance of the
malady in that family, they were prob
ably Ignorant of its true nature until
they were all stricken down, for, as we
all know, that fatal disease travels
rapidly among the members of the
household into which it once enters.
When the cases were diagnosed by the
attending physicians, then the trouble
to find nurses arose,* for it is not every
person who feels that he can afford to
expose himself, however willing and
solicitous he may be. The result was
that the situation was distressing for a
time, as relatives and friends, on ac
count of their families, did not dare to
go and lend a helping hand. A first
class nurse was finally found in' the
person of Mr. Clark, and now all the '
remaining members of the family have
recovered. I They were attended by
two physicians from Jackson, who used
the anti-toxine remedy in combatting
the disease. Tho tale of destitution,
want of food, etc., is the worst kind of
rot. , The family is in comfortable cir
cumstances, but what its members did
want was that timely help which no
amount of money could have secured
under the circumstances.
We clip the above from the Cala
veras Chronicle. The article referred
to was a ipecial dispatch sent from
Stockton. It not only exaggerated the
facts as our cotemporary says, but also
incorrectly gave tho residence of the
Garaventa family as Amador county,
whereas they live on the Calaveras side
of the river.— Ed.]'
C. L, Parish Died in New York.
C: L. Parish, who formerly owned
and operated the Big Bar Bridge
property near this town, died on the
6th instant at the home of his sister
in North Lawrence, New York, where
he had been visiting since la^t summer.
Mr. Parish came to California in 1852,
and was prominently identified, with
the early mining history of this and
Amador counties. He conducted the
bridge business for many years, but in
1874 he disposed of it and moved to
Oakland, where he has since' resided.
Two children are left— Dr. Harry L.
Parish, who practiced medicine in this
town about twelve years ago, but is
now a resident of Calistoga, and Mrs.
Edmund A. Watkins of San Leandro. -
The remains were interred beside his

Mushroom Poisoning.
Another case of mushroom poisoning
happened at Douglas Flat last week.
The family of Jas. Glass, consisting of
the father, two sons and a daughter,
and their guest, An tone Rocco of
Murphys, who dined with them, were
the victims. Thq daughter died, but
the others recovered after a great deal
of suffering. This family had been
gathering and eating mushrooms for
years and believed they could detect
the poisonous from the good ones with
unerring certainty.— Calaveras Chroni

ANOTHER STRIKE IN SAN FRAN
CISCO.
San Francisco seems to be, en
titled to preeminence as the storm
center of strikes. It is rarely free
from the throes of one of these mill
stones upon the industrial progress
of any community. Why tbe
metropolis of California should gain
this unenviable distinction is diffi
cult to understand. That the fre
quency of these labor troubles has
retarted the growth of the city few
will deny. For many years capital
ists have been timid about investing
in enterprises because of this tend
ency of the labor element to revolt.
Within the last few years every de
partment of labor has organized a
union, and these unions — trusting
in the might of numbers perhaps
more than anything else — seek to
control the situation, and dictate
terms to the employers. Naturally,
when such an attitude is assumed,
the other side to the controversy
becomes unyielding, and a struggle
of endurance is the result. These
contests for supremacy are invari
ably inaugurated with the cry that
only peaceful means will be resorted
to in the effort to secure the desired
end. Usually, however, the paths
of peace are not very productive of
results. In a test of endurance be
tween the pockets of the workmen
and the financial strength of their
employers, the advantage is with
the latter. The numerical superi
ority of the workers, and their or
ganization for mutual protection,
do not altogether offset this advan
tage. The employers have also the
privilege of combining for their own
protection, and even things up in
that respect. The toilers exhort
their cohorts to stand shoulder to
shoulder in unbroken array, and the
employers do likewise. The solidity
of the one is the excuse for the
solidity of the other. The rights or
wrongs involved are too often lost
sight of in the bitterness of the
strife, and the contest generally
ends with each party ( figuring up the
losses instead of gains. Strikes,
after all are but relics of barbarism.
They are the dernier resort in the
settlement of labor disputes. When
all other means have failed — too
often before any other means have
been tried — the strike is ordered in
the spirit of a challenge to battle.
This method of settlement occupies
exactly the same place in the labor
world as war among the nations,
inasmuch as it means the dictation
of terms by the victor, by the prac
tical exhaustion of the weaker and
losing side.
T^ie strike of the street car em
ployes in San Francisco is the latest
exhibition of this belligerent spirit.
The new owners of the Market street
system of street railways were
hardly placed in possession when
they are faced with the wholesale
desertion of their employes. The
business of the city is again demora
lized. And the striking employes
congratulate themselves that public
opinion is in their favor, evidently
basing this judgment upon the atti
tude of the press and the fact that
the mayor was elected by the votes
of unionists and their sympathizers.
San Francisco is to be pitied in this
new misfortune.
A SUSPICIOUS MOVEMENT.
A .desperate effort is being made
to prejudice the.public mind against
the proposed constitutional amend
ment No. 28. This amendment is of
a radical and sweeping character.
It proposes to abolish the railroad,
bank, insurance and other commis
sions now existing, and consolidate
the same in the hands of one com
mission, to be known as the state
commission. This is to be com
posed of five persons, whose salary
shull be $6000 per annum each. This
commission is to* have charge of
transportation, gas, electric light,
water, power, telephone, telegraph,
and express companies, also banks
and insurance corporations, with
absolute power to fix rates for the
same. A strong objection to the
amendment is that it gives to the
commission the power of appointing
as many clerks and employes as they
may see fit, and the salaries for
these, as well as their traveling ex
penses, are made a state charge.
Circulars have been sent broadcast
over the state giving reasons why
the amendment should be defeated.
These circulars were distributed
free at the republican convention at
San Jose last week. The document
is stated to be issued by the joint
committee of the San Francisco
board of supervisors and league of
California municipalities. It is con
tended that it will work an injury to
counties and incorporated cities by
taking away the power they now
have of regulating water and gas
rates and street railroad fares, and
also divert the revenue cities and
counties now derive from licensing
these corporations into the state
treasury, as the state commission is
authorized to fix a license for all
such corporations, the money to be
paid into the state treasury, and
the aggregate revenue from" this
source must not be less than the total
cost of the salaries of commissioners,
appointees, and all expenses author
ized by this amendment. No doubt
much may be fairly urged against
the proposed change in the consti
tution. On the other, a good deal
might be said 1 in favor of its adop
tion. It is admitted that the com
missions now in existence, and
which the proposed commission is to
displace, are a failure. They accom
plish nothing. They draw their
salary with never failing regu
larity, and that is . about the only
practical result achieved. It may
be that the new commission would
prove just as unsatisfactory. We are
not prepared to say that the amend
ment is as pernicious as these
municipal commentators wish to
make out. It is quite possible that
much of this agitation to defeat it
comes from interested sources. Of
course, those filling the fat berths
on the present commissions are not
pleased at the prospect of being
legislated out of office by the direct
vote of the people. They will . use
all the influence at their command
to defeat the amendment. The loss
of revenue to the counties and cities
will also tend to weaken the propo
sition, notwithstanding that this
loss will probably be more than off
set by the gaiu to the state treas
ury. All things considered, we
think this sweeping amendment
stands a more than even chance of
going down to defeat, but still, in
spite of the determined opposition,
we cannot get rid of the opinion that
in its spirit and intent, it is a step
in the direction of a much • needed
reform.

TARIFF TINKERING.
The promoters of tariff concessions
to Cuba are having a hard time in
getting their measures adopted by
congress. The reduction is favored
by the administration and many of
the republican leaders, not because
it is sound republican doctrine, but
because, as they claim, it will placa
Cuba on her feet financially. With"
the help of reciprocity she can build
up her shattered industries; with
out it she will be ruined utterly.
Having done so much for Cuba, in
liberating her from the yoke of
Spain, we are in duty bound to do
more. "We have liberated her from
bondage, we must make her rich.
Such is the line of argument adopted.
But many republicans cannot see it
in that light. They view it as a de
parture from the fundamental re
publican policy of protection to
home industry. Democrats approve
it, because it is in the direction of
breaking down the barriers of pro
tection. It accords with their free
trade principles. . The cry that we
are a world power, and • must reach
out after foreign trade is mislead
ing. The home trade is of infinitely
greater importance than foreign
trade. Less than two per cent of
our manufactured goods are sold
abroad. Our prosperity conjes
from the policy of making the arti
cles we need at home and thereby
keeping our labor employed and the
money in our own country.. Any
extra foreign trade we might get by
departing from this policy is not
worth striving for. Republicans
generally are not in favor of this
Cuban scheme of reciprocity, be
lieving that it will be harmful to the
United States and beneficial only to
a few Americans who have invested
in sugar plantations in Cuba, and
work the sympathy-for-Cuba dodge
to conceal their motives of self
interest.

There is more Catarrh in this sec

few years was supposed to be incur
able. For a great many years doctors
pronounced it a local disease, and pre
scribed local remedies, and by constant
ly failing to cure with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable. Science has
proven catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti
tutional treatment. Hall's Catarrh

A PEACEFULf STRIKE.
Tlio press and ninety-nine "v per
cent of the public ; may -sympathize
with the " striking car men in San
Francisco, but that does not prove
that justice and right are all on
their side. Sympathy sometimes,
and for obvious reasons, gravitates
to the side having the strongest
battalions. The force of numbers is
the only argument in sight. 10 their
perverted .vision. The faqt stands
out as clear as noonday that the
powers that be in San Francisco are
doing all they can to win the strike
for the strikers, and at the s.ame
time are practically claiming to bo
strictly neutral and impartial. . It
is a peaceful struggle they say, and
yet the strikers are allowed to board
the cars in overwhelming forco for
the purpose of persuading, in their
own peculiar way, the new employes
to quit their posts. Cars are stoned
and windows smashed, .but this is
done by sympathizers, ■ and not by
the men on strike, and therefore
police . protection . is denied. -/It
makes a great difference we pre
sume to the railroad company
whether their property is destroyed
by the strikers or their aiders and
abettors. If an accident should oc-
cur because of the violation of. the
company's rule prohibiting conver
sation by passengers with the con
ductor or motorman, the, company
would be held responsible. And yet
the authorities of San Francisco are
winking at this very thing.* The
strikers have no more right to enter
a street car on its beat, in order to
tamper with the employes, than
they have to enter the power 4 house
of the company for the same purpose.
The mere payment of the fare en
titles them to a passage, but no
more. And yet the presentation of
five cents is made the cloak for try
ing to stop the company from tran
sacting its business; and the strikers
are congratulated by an admiring
press and public on the peaceful
conduct of their fight. The curse of
San Francisco is that it seems to be
permeated by an unhealthy senti
ment on such questions. Much is
said about the compulsory arbitra
tion of strikes. But we believe the
only feasible way of s^ettl in g labor
troubles is by the passage of a law
making it a crime for anyone to at
tempt to interfere either by force or
moral suasion with an employe dur
ing working hours who has taken
the place of a man on strike. After
working hours they are at liberty to
(?o their best to Win him over to
their side by peaceful methods, but
during the hours of employment the
law should adequately protect him
from molestation in any manner..
This is just to the employer, and no
one can truthfully say it would work
injustice to tbe dissatisfied striker.

NOTICE-.^
When you are about to buy a suijt
of clothes, it would be absurd to go
to a carpenter's shop. When in
need of medicine, you would not call
on the blacksmith to prescribe for
you. To .reasonable people it will
appear that to buy a suit there is
but one place, and that is the tailor
shop, where your suit caa be fitted
on you before being made up; and
where' yeu' can select your g6ods,
nottfrom a piece of scrap "ou paper,
where in ulne'cases out of ten when
your suit' arrives it isn't at all what
you selected. If you buy it home
you can select your goods from a
large assortment of piece goods, and
can see what you are gettiugfor
your money. Your ready made
suits are pressed and remodeled with
no extra charge; this I guarantee.
Remember mine is tbe only place in
Jackson where you can have this
done free of charge.
Have just received a brand new
line of spring and summer goods all
ready made aud to be made up to
order. • Men's, Youth's aud child-
ren's clothing of the latest styles.
Trusting to receive a call from
you, and thanking you for your past
favors, and soliciting the same in
the future,
Max Ladar, the Tailor.

David Fisher was in San Francisco
last week. Ho succeeded in organizing
a company to take hold of tho Edin
burgh claim in Clinton district, which
he has been working on for some time,
and which shows very flattering pros
pect. The company has been incor
porated, and sufficient stock placed to
insure the further development of the
property. He says there is an 8 foot
vein of pay rock, which has been fol
lowed for a considerable distance.
Jas. H. Turner, who lost a foot by
an accident in the Kennedy some years
ago, went to San Francisco two weeks
ago, for the purpose of having an
artificial foot fitted to his leg. He re
turned Thursday of last week, with a
cork pedal, which has materially aided
him in getting around. Indeed the
fact that he is possessed of a false foot
can scarcely be detected from his
movements, so neatly and cleverly Is
the imitation done.
Mrs. L. W. Hagrgerty, who has been
visiting her brothers, Chas. and Will
Rasmusson, for the past two weeks, de
parted for her new home In Amador
City, accompanied by Mrs. Peirce and

who has been engaged in mining at
Nevada City for the past seven months,
has retired from the same there, and
has accepted a position as foreman over
150 men at the Keystone mine at Ama
dor City, at which place they will make
their home. — Placerville Nugget.
J. B. Meek, in prospecting on one of
the lots owned by P. Buffington on the
north end of the Webb-Mason tract,
took out some dirt that yielded as high
as fifty cents to the pan. He thought
at first he had struck a piece of ground
that had been left untouched by the
early miners, but in this he was mis
taken, as close to the bedrock he came
across a piece of a prospector's horn
and other indications that the ground
had been worked for gold. He is of
the opinion, however, that an un
worked gravel seam exists on one of
the vacant lots near by, and has se
cured permission from the owner to
prospect thereon.
L. N. Martell, one of the old resl
denters of Amador county, now living
in Sutter Creek, was in Jackson Mon
day. He is 84 years of age, and called
at the clerk's office while In town to
have his name placed on the great
register. It would be well if all visitors
to the county seat would get in the
voting line for the next general elec
tion by doing likewise. Registration
is proceeding very slowly. Of course,
the people will get a move on as the
campaign begins to warm up. But de
lay in such matters is dangerous. A
serious percentage of voters lost their
votes at the last election because of
failure to get registered in time. Re
publicans especially should see to It
that they are not caught napping this
year. ,
THE AMADOR LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, APRIL 25, 1902,
FIRE AT IONE.
Piccardo's Barn - Destroyed and 4 Horses
Burned to Death— Origin of Fire Un
known.
A destructive fire broke out at lone
at 3 o'clock Wednesday morning, re
sulting In the destruction of the large
barn occupied by A. Piccardo's freight
teams, and all its contents. The barn
was 3ituated near the end of the rail
road track. The building was rented
by A. Piccardo, and used for stabling
his animals" overnight. The night
before the fire there were 26 animals
kept there. But the evening in ques
tion the small freight wagon was at
lone, employing only four animals —
three horses and a mule. The wagon
was loaded up with freight, and left
outside the barn, ready for starting on
the up trip early the next morning.
The teamster, whose name Is Hizer,
did not sleep on the premises, but at
the Commercial hotel, fully half a mile
away. At three o'clock the fire was
discovered by ' neighbors. It had ac
quired such a headway that nothing
could be done in tho way of saving
property ' inside. The four animals
were burned to death in their stalls,
their remains lying in a
ghastly row when the flames had spent
their fury. A large quantity of hay,
amounting to several, tons, and also all
the harness, was destroyed. -The load
ed wagon outside was badly scorched,
but the efforts of those who rushed to
the scene were, successful in saving it,
and also its contents. - Piccardo's loss
will foot up fully $600, without any in
surance. The animals were insured,
but only as occupants of the home barn,
so it is probable that nothing can be
recovered by reason of 'their loss in the
lone barn.
: Treading so closely on the heels of
the late robbery of Piccardo's saloon,
many are disposed^ to -think that the
fire was the work of an incendiary,
and has some connection with that
crime. There is nothing but surmise,
however, to bear out this theory, and
it is probably entertained for want of a
more plausible explanation.
A. Piccardo was notified of the loss
early Wednesday morning by tele
phone and started at once for lone to
look into the matter.
Mr. Piccardo returned Wednesday
evening. He thinks the fire may have
started from- spontaneous combustion
of the hay. Those who noticed the
fire first say it started in that part of
the barn where the hay was stored.
There was a water trough outside, and
the leakage from this probably soaked
through into the hay, and the damp
ness would in tbe course of time gener
ate heat. ' A tramp might have got
into where the horses were kept; but
the hay compartment was locked. The
barn was owned by the Kirk brothers,
and was uninsured. The damage to
the freight in the wagon is estimated
at not to exceed $20. The damaged
freight arrived in Jackson Wednesday
night. . .
A Xiner Badly Injured.
An Italian miner named David Fran
zoia, while working in the slopes of the
Oneida mine last Monday, Was caught
In a cave, and sustained very serious
injuries. He was working with an
other miner, but his companion re
marked that the roof of the stope was
loose and got out of the way. . Fran
zoia, however, started to use the pick,
when a great mass of it fell. " He was
carried by the debris about 10 feet, and
struck by the rock in several places.
His left leg was broken at the thigh,
and his right arm fractured in two
places. His right hand was badly
crushed. Dr. Gall attended the un
fortunate man, and in addition to set
ting the broken limbs, removed a por
tion of the injured hand. The victim
is a single man, 25 years of age, and
lives at a boarding house at Jackson
Gate.

Fatally Burned.
An Italian named Michel Fassatte
was fatally burned in his cabin near
Slabtown on the night of April 14.
His partner who occupied the cabin
with him was away at the time. When
he returned on the night In question,
he found Fassatte severely burned
about the head and back, and suffering
great pain. It is supposed that he was
under the influence of drink; that by
means oi a lighted candle carelessly
handled the bed clothing was ignited,
and the victim received his injuries
before he was aware of the fire. He
was brought to the county hospital
early on the morning of the 15th, but
in spite of all that could be done for
him, . he died from the effect of the
burns on the 21st instant. He has
been a resident of this section for many
years, and was commonly known as
. ' 'Garabaldi. ' ' He seems to ha ye had
no relatives in the county.
The Ficcardo Bobbery.
Nothing new has transpired in rela
tion to the robbery of Piccardo's saloon
two weeks ago. Notwithstanding the
prevailing belief that the perpetrator
of that crime was severely wounded,
not a trace of the desperado has been
discovered, beyond the finding of tbe
bloody garments at the Bellwether
mine, as narrated in these columns last
week.

WITH THE GOLD PRODUCERS
Reopening of the Original
Amador Mine.
Bright Prospects for the Mitchell and
Defender— The Sargent Mine to be
Started Immediately.
.Reward.— Some work is being done
on this property near Pino Grove. J.
A. Brown is surveying for an upraise
from tbe 200 foot level to the surface.
Mitchell.— The work of enlarging
the Mitchell mill near Pine Grove, has
commenced. A ton ftamp mill was
recently purchased in Placer county.
This material has been received at
lone, and the work of hauling it to the
mine is now in progress. Tho first
load was received on the ground on
Thursday of last week. With these
additional ten stamps the capacity of
the mill will be more than doubled, as
the new stamps are heavier than the
old ones, having a crushing capacity' of
3} tons per stamp o\'ery 24 hours. The
old mill is also being put in thorough
repair. Considerable work is also be
ing done on the hoisting works. A
new gallows frame is being erected; in
fact, the entire works are undergoing
a complete overhauling. The mine is
1 not operating at present, owing to the
progress of these improvements. It
wiil tako from six weeks to two months
to get the new works in running order.
The mine is looking well, and the
underground developments are such as
to warrant the careful and efficient
superintendent, L. C. Hyner, in pro
viding this larger and ! better equip
ment. The success of the Mitchell
ought to encourage the development of
other claims on the same belt.
Defender.— This mine in Pioneer
district continues to turn out the
bullion with gratifying liberality. Last
Monday a shipment 'of gold, the out
put of 20 days run of the four.stamp
mill, was made. The product was a
bar weighing about 18 pounds, and
valued at something over $2000. The
mill will crush about 8 tons .per day,
and on this basis tbe yield was at the
rate of $12 per ton. The richest ore,
however, is sent below for treatment.
Some of it will run over $100 per ton.
The mine is opened to the depth of 300
feet. They are now stoping from the
200 foot level, with plenty of rock in
sight. There is a 7 foot voin, and the
prospects of the mine were never
brighter. It is reported that negotia
tions are in progress for the sale of the
property for $100,000. The district is
rich in mineral, and the success of the
Defender will undoubtedly encourage
the further exploration of that" region.
Work on the Sargent mine adjoining
the Hardenburg, near Middle Bar, and
which. has recently been incorporated,
will be started at once. W. R.
Thomas, superintendent of the Cen
tral Eureka, who was instrumental in
organizing the company, has notified
interested parties that a survey of tbe
property will be commenced to-morrow.
Bunker Hill.— Levels at the 800
and 1400 are being driven north and
south. A level is also, being run from
the 200 to connect with the Mayflower
tunnel, so that the water will only
need to be pumped to this point instead
of to the collar of the shaft. In the
800 north level a small vein of good ore
was encountered on the hanging wall
this week. It has the indications of
widening out into a big lodge. The
1400 levels are In low grade ore, but the
quality of same is gradually growing
better as the drifts extend from the
shaft.
The Del Monte mine in Calaveras
county is now connected by telephone
with the office in Jackson.'
Negotiations are in progress looking
to tho starting up of the Original Ama
dor mine at Amador City. This mine
has been shut down for eighteen years..
It was explored to a depth of 1400 feet.
The surface shows that the country is
much broken up at that point. The
range of hills on which the Keystone
and Sauth Spring Hill mines are lo
cated, is broken on the Original Ama
dor ground, and a ravine formed,
through which Amador creek passes.
As might be expected this broken -up
condition prevails beneath the surface.
Bunches of good ore were found, but
no well defined ledge was discovered.
It is believed by many, however, that
at greater depth the true fissure will
assert itself. Eastern parties have
taken hold of the property, and are
prepared to spend considerable money
in its exploration: i -
Capitalists from San Francisco are
expected in Jackson dally, to inspect
the Amador-Phoenix mine near Wie
land, with a view of investing therein.
Edinburgh— Tho Edinburgh Gold
Mining Co. is the name of a corpora
tion recently organized in San Fran
cisco, by the efforts of David Fisher,
to operate a promising vein near Wiel
and. It is on what ii called in Tuol
umne and Calaveras county, tho east
belt, on which several rich mines have
been opened up. The company is cap
italized at $200,000, in shares of $1 each.
Enough stock has been placed to insure
the thorough development of the prop
erty. The directors are Captain Brush,
G. D. Maxwell, David Fisher and
Clarkson Dye. David Fisher is the
superintendent, and let a contract this
week to drive the tunnel 500 feet fur
ther along the vein. The ledge has
already been followed 150 feet, and
shows well In size and values. The ore
carries 3 per cent of sulphurets, which
assays $55 per ton. Drillings ' taken
from clear across the vein assays $7.50
per ton in free gold.

Fell Down a Well
Mamie Williams, aged nine years,
daughter of Mrs. Emma Williams, who
lives near the new bridge on Pitt street,
had an unpleasant experience Tuesday
evening. With her older sister Gwln
nie, she went to Mrs. Bradley 's to get
some milk. Close to the path by the
side of the bouse there is an old well
planked over. The child, unaware of
the existence of the well, undertook to
walk across the plank. When in the
centre it broke, and Mamie fell into
the well. Her sister was in front, and
heard the crash of the plank and the
splash in the water, and at once rea
lized what had happened. At the first
plunge Mamie went over her head.
Upon her reappearance her sister
called to her to hold on to the pipe
that went down into the water, which
she did, while Gwinnie called for help.
Mr. Lepley, Clarence Parker and
Lincoln Love were, soon on the spot,
and succeeded in getting the child out
of her unpleasant predicament. Be
yond the scare, Mamie came out of the
ordeal unhurt. •' ••■.

ably well, and feed, especially in the
foothill section, •is abundant. In the
valleys the natural feed is somewhat
short in growth, but a shower or two
is apt to work a wonderful change in
the outlook. Altogether the season
has been unusually propitious, and
crops of every kind are 'likely to be
above the average. So far there have
been no blighting frosts to nip the

evening an entertainment was given in

cream and other refreshments were
sold. The exercises were as follows:
Song, "America;" song, Alta Peek;
doll drill, by 14 little girls; song,
Clarence Dunstan; color drill, by nine
girls. There was a large attendance,
and the entertainment was enjoyed by
all. The sum of $50 was realized,
which will go towards, paying the
pastor's salary.
Another Case of Diphtheria.
Another case of diphtheria has de
veloped in the Garaventa family near
Middle Bar in Calaveras county. The
victim la a boy about 8 years of age,
the only one that escaped the disease at
its first outbreak. The case is a mild
one, and the patient is getting along
favorably. The quarantine had been
raised for several days when this new
case appeared. The trustees of the
district decided that it was unnecessary
to close the school again, as since the
first appearance of the disease none of
the stricken family has been permitted
to attend school. Of the two deaths
that have occurred from this terrible
malady, In the one case, that of a boy,
the immediate cause of death was
heart failure, while the other victim, a
little girl, choked to death. It is re
ported that the physicians who attend
ed the family resorted to the anti
toxine treatment, and in every case
where the remedy was administered
within a reasonable time, the patient
recovered.
Shall We Celebrate.
The matter of celebrating the coming
Fourth of July in Jackson is becoming
a topic of conversation among the
business people. We see no reason
why the county seat should not have a
celebration this year, notwithstanding
the fact that the big attraction of last
year was. held here. It is getting to bo
more and more the custom for each
township to do something in the way
of celebrating independence day. It is
no longer the case, as was the practice
of years ago, that one big festival will
satisfy the demands of the entire coun
ty. A celebration even at a central
point in the county, will be attended
only slimly by residents outside of the
immediate vicinity of the town. This
has been the experience of successive
years, and is the foundation of the de
sire in each center of population to
celebrate the national birthday in its
own way. At last year's celebration
the sum of over $500 was raised by pub
lic subscription, which was augmented
by receipts from ball and other sources
to over $750. Out of this there is a
balance to the credit of the fund of $42,
which is available for the coming
fourth if it is decided to ' celebrate in
Jackson. Last year's affair was fairly
satisfactory, and an equally creditable
showing can be made with considerably
less money, as there is now only one
local band, whereas two had to be em
ployed a year ago. It remains for the
business men to decide what shall bfj
done In the premises, and the sooner
an agreement is reached the better will
it be for all csngerned.

KILLED BY AN EXPLOSION.
Two Miners Blown to Pieces While
Drilling in the Lincoln Mine.
A terrible accident occurred at the
Lincoln mine, Sutter Creek, last night,
causing the instant death of two men,
Jack Nelson and Sol Wedge. These
men were engaged in running a Bur
leigh drill in the sinking operations in
the shaft at* the depth of 1800 feet.
Two other men-wore employed in run
ning another drill on the opposite side
of the shaft, the skip standing at the
bottom, separating the two crews. It
Is customary to drill ten or a dozen
holes, each four feet deep,' in various
directions, before charging and ex
ploding them. It is impossible to tell
whether all the charges have exploded,
and in this fact lies the danger of drill
ing operations. .In running tho holes,
the minors above named must have
drilled into an unexploded hole. As
soon as the drill struck the charge of
powder, it exploded, and the workers
were literally blown to pieces. The
other two men, whose names we have
not been able to ascertain, owing to the
shelter afforded by the skip standing
between them and the place of ex
plosion, escaped without injury. The
debris struck against the .skip and left
them untouched. They consider them
selves remarkably fortunate in escaping
with a 'big scare and a few scratches.
The men who thus so suddenly were
called by death, were both single men.
Nelson was about 35 years of age, and
came from Winnemucca, Nevada, al
though he had been working in Sutter
Creek several years. Wedge was about
22 years old, and a native of Sutter
Creek. His father was killed a year
or so ago at one of tho mines in Sutter
Creek by a timber rolling on him.
He Kept His Leg.
Twelve years ago J. W. Sullivan, of
Hartford Conn., scratched his leg with
a rusty wire. Inflammation and blood
poisoning set in. For two years he
suffered intensely. Then the best doc
tors urged amputation, "but,") he
writes, "I.used one bottle of Eletrlc
Bitters and 1} boxes of Bucklen's Arni
ca Salve and my leg was sound and
well as ever." For Eruptions, Eczema,
Tetter, Salt Rheum, Sores and all
blood disorders Electric Bitters has no
rival on earth. Try them. D. B.
Spagnoli will guarantee satisfaction or
refund money. Onlj 50 cents.
Workmen's Picnic.
The committees appointed by Jack-
son Lodge No. 138, A. O. U. W., to
arrange for a picnic have decided to
have it on Saturday, May 17, the site
selected being Kennedy heights, in the
grove just west of the reservoirs of the
Kennedy and Argonaut mines. Amuse
ments of various kinds will be pro
vided, including a baseball game, tug
of war, professional men vs. clerks,
,f oot races, etc. ; also dancing on a plat
form 48x60 feet. The procession will
start from town at 8:30 a. m., and a
short literary program will be carried
out on arrival at the grounds. The
Jackson baifd will furnish the music
for the day, and also for the ball in
Love's hall in the evening. The picnic
is to be a basket affair, but refresh
ments will be provided on the ground
for those who do not come provided
therewith. Full particulars will be
given next week. '
Another case of scarlet fever has de
veloped in Jackson, the victim being
Allan Peek, son of Mr. and Mrs. Tom
Peek, aged 8 years. The caso is a very
mild one. The residence on Peek's
addition has been quarantined, the red
flag being hung out Wednesday. The
other case, in the family of M. New
man, is convalescent, although quar
antine is still in force thoiu.
The Q^H Follows picnic and celebra
tion at West Point, advertised to tako
place the 26th of April, has been post
poned until tbe 3d of May.

DISTILLED WATER.
It Is the Purest, Beat and Only Ab-
solutely Safe Water.
Boil a gallon of water until there is
but a quart left, and the quart will
contain all the impurities . of the gal
lon and be nearly four times as im
pure as before. . Continue the boiling,
and all the impurities— animal, vege
table and mineral, except the gases
thrown off— will be reduced to one sol
id mass. The water which is evapo
rated and passed off as steam is very
nearly pure. But, you will say, it kills
the dangerous germs. We will sup
pose it does, but their remains furnish
material for bacterial life to feed up
on. Do you relish the idea of eating
in food or drinking their dead and de
composing bodies, which poison the
water by their decomposition? The
fact is scientific investigation has prov-
Pd that boiling only kills the feeblest,
the least injurious, germs.
Try a simple experiment Put un
boiled city Avater in one bottle and the
same that has been boiled for half an
hour or more in another, cork tightly
and keep in the sun or in a warm place
for a week or longer and note the dif
ference. The unboiled water will show
a marked depreciation in looks, taste
and smell, but that which has been
boiled will be so much worse in these
respects that no one would think of
using it. In comparison with these
you can submit a properly sealed bot
tle of pure 'distilled water to the same
conditions, and at the end of a year it
will be found to be as pure, sweet and
perfect as ,when first bottled. ;
. The purest< and best and the only ab
solutely safe water to use for drink
ing and the (preparation of all foods
and artificial} drinks is that produced
by distillation, but the most imperfect
one produces a water far superior in
purity and 'healthf ulness to the very
best . spring waters under their most
favorable conditions. The nearest ap
proach to it in purity is rainwater,
which is distilled water of nature's
own . production, when collected on
clean surfaces, in 'uninhabited sections,
where the air is pure and uncontami
nated by smoke, dust, city and factory
gases, etc.— Sanitarian. .

THE JAPAN CURRENT.
Knro Slwo Piles Great Loads of
Driftwood on Alanka'a Shores.
In one sense the Kuro Siwo, or Japan
current is the most interesting In the
world because many oceanographers
believe it was the direct means of peo
pling America. This much at least Is
certain: If a boat were to be set adrift
on parts of the Asiatic coast and sur
vived all storms, the Japan current
could be depended upon to carry it
across the Pacific and deposit it on the
American shore. Such a thing .has
happened. In 1832 nine Japanese fish
ermen were left dereUct and unable to
find their way back to shore. They
went with the current and after a
drift lasting, during several months
they were carried to Hawaii.
Trees torn by storms from the banks
of Asiatic rivers frequently float across
the Pacific to the American coast Be
tween Kakatag and Kyak islands,
about 1,200 miles northwest of Seattle,
enormous piles of , this driftwood cover
the \h -iii-hcn, There can be no question
of the Asiatic origin of the timber.
They are the trunks of the camphor
tpte, the mango and the mahogany.
Logs 160 feet long and eight feet In di
ameter are frequently found. Many of
them are seen floating shoreward, with
fantastic roots standing high above the
waves. In places the logs are piled
twenty feet high. They are generally
without bark, .which has been peeled
off by the waves, and most of them
have become white and heavy from
impregnation with salt water. As they
pile up the sands drift over them, and
gradually they sink out of sight and
new beaches are formed. This process
has been going on for ages, and the
shore line Is being steadily extended.
Excavations along the beach show that
texture of the burled timber gets hard
er and harder the farther In you go,
until in some instinceß petrifaction has
taken place. Otlier excavations show
logs that have turned to coaL
The presence of Siberian , driftwood
on the shores of Greenland \ convinced
Nauseu that his idea of drifting across
the Polar sea in the Fram wns logical.
Great quantities of the wood are an
nually cast on the coasts of Spits
bergen and Nova Zembla, and there
are tribes of Greenland Eskimos who
depend for sledge runners and - other
wooden implements on the drift from
Siberian forests. For years they de
pended for* iron implements on the
hoops of casks which came to them
over seas.— Theodore Waters 'ln Ains
lee's.
The Willing; Worker.
"Why is it," asked a modest' young
breadwinner, "that when I stay. at the
office after hours to voluntarily ' do au
extra amount of work somebodty who
is in charge pounces upon me as his
justifiable victim and gives me still
more to do? .
. "That has happened to me time after
time in my business, and at each*repe-,
tition I have taken a vow that if I am
ever iv charge of an office I shall give
any one of my subordinate who sits
down and does work which Isn't specif
ically required of him credit for what
he does do and let it go at that with
out adding insult to injury, as it were,
by giving him something further to do.
. "Of course it's an old saying that the
man who does the most work is tho
man usually 'worked;' but it's discour
aging, don't you think? Strangely
enough, though, he goes ahead and lets
himself be 'worked,' with only a weak
objection to ease bis feelings."— New
York Mail and Express.
Mnshrooms Are Filling;.
One virtue of the mushroom that of
tentimes is not. realized by its cham
pions even is its nutritive qualities, for
It is often considered fit only for a
sauce or a side dish. Recently I ate
dinner with a friend who is a bon vi
vant and gifted with an abnormally
large appetite. To my surprise, he or
dered nothing but mushrooms, bread"
and butter and, of course, drinkables.
We had mushrooms raw, stewed, fried
and broiled on toast. It was my first
experience, but I found them excel-
lent I certainly thought they would
not "stay by me;" but to my surprise,
for many hours afterward I had as
complete a sense of fullness as rare
roast beef or juicy steak ever impart
ed.—New York Telegram.
Tlie Congressional Record.
To appreciate .the value of The Con
gressional Hecord one must see it used.
It is the only means by which members
themselves keep informed of the prog
ress of legislation when scores 'of
measures are often considered in a
day. It is on the desk of the president
of the United States and is read by
every executive officer, from cabinet to
chief of division. Every g6vernment
in the world envies ours the possession
of such a publication, forming at ouce
an indispensable current record and a
permanent history of events even more
valuable through the centuries.—Argo

Clears and Tobacco.
There are between 1,500,000 and
2,000,000 brands of cigars sold in this
country, and your average . smoker
thinks that every brand means a differ
ent kind of tobacco. As a matter of
fact 150 is an outside estimate of the
different kinds of tobacco that can be
procured from all sources, and even ex
perts can't tell some of these apart. '

Some years ago at a Mardl Gras ball
at the Hopkins Institute of Art a man,
masked, approached a woman, masked,

MEMORY DOES NOT FAIL.
It Simply Gtli Weak and Langrnl*
Por Want of VHe.
Memory does not. "fall" (except In
lora of all the faculties); It simply gets
v.-iuk and languid for want to use. Just
as tlie ph.vsical organs do. People of
ten say, "My memory Is falling," when
It is really as good as ever If they
would give it a chance.
A word,' a date, a name, an incident,
comes up, or rather falls to come up
ivuen yon want It. There seems to be
no possible way of remembering It
You make two or three efforts, give up
and any, "There's no use; lt'fl gone
from me."
. Nonsense! It hasn*t. It Is there Just
as much as it ever was. only there are
a lot of things ovor It. Keep at work,
bring your will to bear upon it, try and
try and try, and after awhile you can
pet it.
And, better, you will find that the ex
ercise required in remembering It will
help you next time, and that a little
toil and determination put together
will accomplish wonders in the whole
range of the faculties.
Look over your memory, see where
you are moet deficient and exercise it
in that respect You can do it at any
odd time; while you are walking, rid
ing, resting after a day's work, listen
ing perforce to a dull speaker. Don't
let a few failures discourage yon. The
long corridor of recollection lined upon
both sides with valuable material will
be opened for you because of your Im
portunity If you use it— Everywhere.
A Little Too Sure.
A well known Philadelphian is noted
for his inability to remember j faces.
He has passed by his best friends on
the street as though he never before
had seen them. A woman of his ac
quaintance Is equally famous for nev
er forgetting a face. She prides her
self on this "gift" and she declares
that the faces of every man, woman
and child whom she has ever met is
photographed on her memory- The ab
sentminded man • had passed her by
several times, looking blankly at her.
At last she said: .
."I. wager a box of the best cigars
you ever smoked that I will recall my
self to your recollection the. next time I
meet you." ' V
The man in return wagered a box of
gloves. One day the woman, going
along Walnut street felt sure she saw
the man. He was abreast of her and
showed no sign of recognition, j The
woman had an umbrella with her. She
gave a sudden poke with it and hit the
man's ribs. Startled, her victim looked
up.
"Madam," he began in confusion. '
"I beg your pardon," blushed the wo
man. "I — I struck the wrong man."
She had never seen him before in
her life.— Philadelphia Times.
Only ' Two Held the Office.
A town in central Illinois boasted for
many years 'of a most ornamental fig
ure which adorned the town square
seven days in the week. His name was
Price Poor, and in splendor of attire he
rivaled the Beau Hlckman of the capi
tal. He had a numerous family, which
he kept well in the background during
the few hours he spent at home. In the
course of political events in Illinois
Price Poor was elected a justice of the
peace. He was prouder of the: office
than a bird of paradise. The neighbors
shared his glory by reflection. One of
them was seated in Justice Poor's sit
ting room one day soon after the elec
tion and heard the justice talking with
his eldest son.
"Is we all jestlces, paw?" the boy
asked wlßtfully.
The old man had something of an
impediment in his speech. "Eh-no, my
son," he answered; "only eh-me and
eh-your maw."— Washington Star.
His Second Lea; Pension.
The British admiral Sir James Gor
don was a humorist in his way, and it
is related of him and Admiral Pell that
they used to amuse themselves in lei
sure hours by running foot races, be
ing quite evenly matched, Sir James
having a cork leg and Pell, one of
wood.
. As an instance of his fondness for
practical joking a story is now told:
Sir James during a battle toward the
end of his fighting career had his
wooden leg shot away. The old sea
fighter at once applied for a second
"leg pension" and cheerfully drew it to
the end of his days!
Lottery Methods.
An English writer declares that finan
cial "morality, imperfect as it is in our
day, is superior to that of the epoch
that came to an end in 1526 with the
abolition of lotteries. Take a single
instance. Lord North in 1779, while
the American war of Independence
was in progress, issued 60,000 lottery
tickets, 20,000 of which were given as
bribes to members Of parliament"

.Stories of brute toughness and Ho
meric endurance are tenderly, preserv
ed in the folklore of the water front
—how, for Instance, Scipio Flanagau,
"the biggest nigger in the business,"
supported the entire weight of an Im
mense packing case, weighing upward
of 1,800, on his prostrate body. The
negro held the hand truck to receive
the case, which in the hands of half a
dozen men was being balanced at just
the right angle to slip Into place. But
it hit the edge of the truck and knock
ed It away, and the negro unluckily
lost his footing and fell fiat with the
great box on top of him. He shrieked
in terror and groaned, It was Bald, like
a siren whistle, but. < when a gang of,
fifteen men lifted the thing bodily and
pulled him out all he did was to screw
his fists into his eyes like a big child,
stretch his long limbs grotesquely and
return to work. Of course he talked
about this feat for many a day.— Frank
Leslie's Monthly.
The Going: to Theater Face.
Will some one please explain the "go
ing to the theater face" of the average
New Yorker? The question is suggest
ed by a long experience In lobbies while
the auditors are passing into the houses
for the evening performances. The
writer stood for nearly an hour engag
ed in the seemingly hopeless task of
discovering "the cheerful theater goer."
But in they poured, men and women,
each and every one with firm set jaw,
gloomy brow and the look of despair.
Perhaps it is because the long distances
traveled on crowded cars and the
thought of an equally uncomfortable
hoinegoing make a night at the thea
ter seem just a bit like work to the
residents of this narrow Isle.— New
York Commercial Advertiser.
A Very Old English Cloth.
Fustian la a species of cotton cloth
much used by the Normans, particular
ly by the clergy, and appropriated to
some orders for their cashubles. The
Cistercians were forbidden to - wear
them made of any material but linen or
fustian. A stronger description was
first manufactured in England at Nor
wich, temp. Edward VI. ' -
It was much used for doublets and
Jackets in the fifteenth century,' at
which time It appears to have been im
ported from Italy. "Fustians of Na
ples" are named in a petition to parlia
ment from the manufacturers of Nor
wich in 1551. The name was corrupted
In England into "futianapes" and "fus
