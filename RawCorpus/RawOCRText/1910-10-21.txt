Harry Cobb Disappears
Harry Cobb, who was arrested and
convicted by the local court for aban
doning his children, several months
ago, and was allowed his freedom on
a probation order of- the court, left
Jackson last week, and has not been
heard from since. Cobb's orders were
not to leave the county, and in his so
doing, he has become liable to
Bevere punishment if captured, as his
crime is a felony and carries a state
prison penalty as punishment. Cobb
continually complained that he could
not meet the obligations imposed
upon him by the court, because as he
asserted, the town could not furnish
him with' sufficient employment at his
trade, which is that of painting.
However, the real cause of the man's
downfall is his inability to keep from
imbibing in drink.
Groceryman on Trip
Peter L. Cassinelli, a local grocery
man of this city, and his wife, left
for Stockton on Wednesday morning,
where they will spend several days
visiting relatives. From Stockton,
tney will go to San Francisco, where
they expect to remain about a week.
The store is left under the manage
ment of Frank Giannini, the genial
and obliging little clerk.

The various joint committees of
"The Woman's Improvement Club of

in this city, met at the home of Mrs
J. J. Wright on Court street on Mon
day evening last, and completed ar
rangements for the ravoli and chicken

been arranged under the auspices • of
the society and which will be held to

Moore's orchestra has been engaged
and everything will be done to help all

Davis Making Good
The regular republican candidate
for the office of sheriff, John S.
Davis, is reported to be doing good
work in and about Volcano, in the
way of making dependable friends
and acquaintances in that locality.
Davis was comparatively unknown in
that section of ..the county prior to the
announcement of his candidacy for
sheriff, but late reports are to the
effect that all those who meet Davis
iike him, and many promise to sup
port him next month.
New Street Crossing
A new culvert and cement sidewalk
was laid on Main street at the foot of
Court street this week. The. old cul
vert was clogged with mud and the
timbers forming the viaduct were de
cayed, making it a dangerous foot
trap for horses.
The old crossing at this junction was
about the most miserable in the city,
although it was about the most used.
Injured By Fall
By making a niistep in the darkness,
Ernest Morrow fell from the porch
at the home of his parents, Geo.
Morrow, in Newmanville on Tuesday,
night, and sustained a broken leg.
Dr. Gall was summoned, and found
the unfortunate boy suffering from a
bad break in the bone of the right leg
just above the joint of the ankle.
Deluge of Literature
If all the bureau reports sent by the
state candidates for office were pub
lished, the county papers would have
no Bpace left for local affairs. Never
before has there been such a deluge
of literature sent forth, for free inser
tion.
Little Miss Improving
Louise, the eight year old daughter
of Thomas Grosso, who was stricken
with diptheria last week, is improv
ing nicely, under the care of Dr; A.
M. Gall of Jackson. The home has
been quarantined and no further
trouble is anticipated from the dis
ease.
Elopers In Trouble
Yesterday morning about 10 a. m.
Chris Bakovich, who is proprietor of a
boarding house at Jackson Gate,
eloped with Miss Sophie Milyovich,
tho 15 year old neice of John Milyo
vich, who resides on Broadway.
The pair secured a team at Green &
Ratto's livery stable, and drove to
lone, expecting to be able to connect
with the noon train for Gait. When
they arrived in lone, they found the
train had left, and plans were then
made to leave lone at 4 p. m.
After putting up their team at the
lone livery, they phoned to the local
stables, informing them that they
would have their team returned by an
lone driver. This phone message
started a turmoil which resulted in
crushing the boat in which they had
planned to sail on life's sea of matri
mony.
John Milyovich, who is guardian of
the girl, up to this time had no know
ledge of the actions of his neice, and
when he learned of them by phone,
he immediately ordered Bakovich to
return with the girl, and wait until
she was of legitimate age to marry.
The reply came back that he would
bring his intended back to Jackson on
the evening train.
The lover, however, had no, inten
tion of giving up his prize so easily,
and when the 4 o'clock train left lone
for Gait, the pair were comfortably
seated in a coach bound, for the main
line.
Milyovich was informed again by
phone of the departure of the couple,
and to prevent the elopers carrying
out their plans, orders were sent to
Gait ordering the arrest of Bakovich,
on complaint of Milyovich.
When the train pulled into Gait sta
tion, the pair were captured, and held
in custody, and will be returned to
Jackson to-day.
Stevenot In City
F. G. Stevenot, republican candi
date for assembly, was in Jackson
yesterday, and will, visit during the
"next few days all the towns on the
lode, and also lone.* Owing to lack of
time he will be unable to visit a
number of smaller and outlying places,
as he has to make a trip to every
county in the district, which inclulcles
Alpine and Mono. Mr Stevenot is a
pleasant, genial, and intelligent
gentleman, well posted on matters
concerning Calaveras and the whole
district. The republicans are to be
congratulated upon having such a can
didate. We can recommend him as
worthy the support of every voter.
Farewell Party.
The members of Oro Fino Circle, at
a meeting on Wednesday evening last,
tendered their farewell greetings to
Mrs F. W. Parker, who on Monday
next, will leave Jackson to take up
her abode in Alameda county. A
suitable program was renderded, on
the occasion, and all present ex
pressed their wishes that happiness
and prosperity may follow the retiring
member to her new home. Mr Parker,
the night watchman, will also leave
for the new home, as their grown-up
family are located around the bay and
other points, in lucrative situations.
Fine Sample of Gold
H. D. Emerson, who carries with
him a degree of mystery, came into
posession of a certain amount of gold
leaf lately, which is pronounced ex
tremely fine gold by Langhorst, the
jeweler. Emerson refused to ' tell
where he obtained the metal, and says
his only purpose in bringing it to
Langhorst was to negotiate a sale.
Contagious Diseases
County health officer. Dr. E. E. En
dicott of Jackson, reports four cases of
smallpox in lone, and as a result
three homes are under quarantine. A
like number of homes are quarantined
in Amador City, owing to several
cases of scarlet fever in that town.
Jackson has her name on the infection
disease column also, with one case of
diptheria to her credit.
Back from Trip
Geo. Lucot. who represented the
local Masonic lodge at the meeting of
the grand lodge which convened at San
Francisco last Tuesday, returned to
his home greatly pleased with his trip,
on Sunday evening. Much important
work was done at the meeting, among
which was the order to construct a
new Masonic temple in San Francisco.
BAZAAR WAS
BIG SUCCESS
Over Twelve Hundred
Dollars Cleared By
Workers
The Catholic bazaar held in Love's
hall last Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday evening, proved a big financial
success, tho receipts amounting to
over twelve hundred dollars.
Much of the money will go towards
helping defray the vast expense which
is incurred by the Catholic church of
America, through the large orphan
homes and hospitals which the church
maintains solely through contributions
and collections.
The hall was reautifully decorated'
and was packed with people from the
opening until the closing of the affair.
Booths that were piled high with
beautiful and luxurious articles were
all cleaned out.
Among the booths erected were the
Sodality booth managed by Miss
Janette White, aasistud by Agnes
Leonard, Lizzie Going and Lucy Pero
vich.
. Fancy booth, managed by Mrs Perry
Lepley, assisted by Mrs 11. Marre, Mrs
Rose Podesta, and Mrs Chas. Vicini.
Ice cream, candy, etc., was managed
by Mrs Lena Podesta and Mrs Thomas
Ryan. .
The wheel of fortune waa in opera
tion, and required considerable oil
to keep it from running hot, owing to
the strenous work it was doing. Can
didates of every creed were busy
grinding away dollars, and it was
often impossible for the gentle sex to
get within seeing distance of this fas
cinating game.
Many beautiful and useful articles
were presented to those who officiated
in the work, by residents from all over
the county.
Following is a list of those who re
ceived prizes that were raffled off.
Art square,' Miss Ella Going.
Electric lamp, Miss Connors of Sutter.
$20 gold piece, Mrs Frank Podesta.
Dinner set, Miss Ella Going.
$10 gold piece, D. S. Mason.

ladies, who by their cooperation,
made the Catholic fair such a decided
sucess, and also wishes to express his
gratitude to the community who also
by their patronage helped the fair to
realize $1250 net.
Concert Enjoyed
The band held its usual weekly con
cert last Saturday evening from the
balcony of the Dispatch building, and
won for itself credit and applause.
The fourth selection entitled, "Wed
ding of the Winds," composed by J.
T. Hall, was of exceptional merit, and
very ably rendered. "Sky Pilot,"
an overture recently secured by the
band, was also given full justice by
the players.
The street was well filled with at
tentive . admirers who repeatedly
clapped for encore. No concert will
be given this week, owing to the ab
sence of the leader, Archie S. Moore,
who is compelled to be away on busi
ness.
Insurance Money Paid
Un an order issued by the grand
lodge of the Ancient Order of United
Workmen, Geo. A. Gntton, who is
local lodge receiver of Jackson lodge,
A. O. U. W. No. 1138. and W. J.
Nettle who isa master workman of the
order, paid Mrs Spiro two thouand
dollars insurance, which was the
amount carried by her husband at the
time of his death.
Repairing Phone Lines
A crew of about 15 men arrived in
Jackson this week. They are employed
by the Pacific State telephone and
telegraph company, and are overhaul
ing and doing general repair work to
the company's property. The crew
have tho section between Cosumnes
river, Slough house and Jackson to
keep in order.
A Poor Policy.
Rumors drift to our ears occasionally
of very foolish and impolitic remarks
indulged in by some candidates,
whose better judgment becomes
clouded in the heat of passion, and the
overweening desire to continue in
office. The office seeker intimates
that he will "get even" on some who
are opposing his plans to hang on to
the emoluments of office. We do not
know whom such remarks are intended
for; probably they are Intended for all
who do not fall in with the aspira
tions of the speaker. As far as the
Ledger is concerned, this sort of talk
carries no weight whatever, and it is
unlikely to have any other effect upon
others except to insure the defeat of
those who have so little respect for
the rights of free American citizens as
to indulge in such threats. We have
been accustomed to this sort of lan
guage for many years. It is notorious
that the controling clique have done,
and are still doing all in their power to
"get even" with the Ledger. They
would do the same with any one who
declines to tall in with tbeir methods.
We, However, prefer to follow the
dictates of our own judgment, and do
our duty as we see it, than to seek
the indorsement of all such self-seek
ing politicians by sacrificing our
ideas of right.
Growing Rapidly
The Woman's Improvement club of
Jackson held its second meeting in the
courtroom Saturday afternoon.
New members to the number of
twenty nine presented their names,
making a total membership of fifty
six.
It was suggested by some of the"
ladies to have posters printed in
English, Italian and Austrian, to have
tacked up in conspicouus places all
over the county, to call the attention
of the voters to the special election
for Amador county high school, on
November 7th.
The above suggestion was acted
upon and Mrs Marelia, "Miss Louise
McLaughlin, and Mrs Frank Fuller
were appointed a committee to see
that the posters were printed and dis
tributed.
The next meeting of the club will be
held in the local schoolhouse at 2
o'clock p. m , Saturday, October 22nd.
All the ladies of Jackson and vicinity
are cordially invited to come and join
the club, and help the campaign for
county high school.
Out on Probation
A. Pemberton, who was hailed into
court on a charge of non-support, ap
peared before Judge Wood on Tuesday
of last week, and plead guilty to the
charge. Sentence was deferred until
Thursday of the same week.
The prisoner succeeded in securing
employment in a local mine, and was
allowed his freedom on a probation or
der of the court. After sound advice
the judge ordered Pemberton to pay
his wife $30 per month and the county
$10 per month until the indebtedness
incurred by the county in bringing the
prisoner to justice be paid, which
amount is over 50 dollars.
Lodged in Jail
Manuel Mello, who resides near
Butte, in this courty, became intoxi
cated last week, and in an angry
passion, attacked his aged mother,
who has been an invalid for some
time.
The sheriff was notified of his
actions, and deputy sheriff Connors
repaired to the place and placed the
man under arrest. Mello was taken to
the county jail and locked up on a
charge of battery, to await a prelimi
nary hearing which will be given him
shortly.
School Teacher 111
Jackson gate school is being con
ducted by Mrs F. Fuller, who will act
as teacher during the illness of the
regular teacher, Mrs Botto, who is
confined to her home with a severe at
tack of malaria fever. Dr. Gall is the
attending physician, and reports his
patient as progressing nicely.

MINE NEWS
ALONG LODE
Interesting Accounts of
/Mines Located In
Amador Co.
Hardenburgh
This quartz mine is located near
Middle Bar, three miles south of
Jackson. It has not been operated for
nearly twenty years. It is considered
a very promising property. Some very
good ore was encountered when it was
operated last. Owing to the neces
sity of sinking, and the owners having
other interests considered more im
portant at that time, the mine was
closed down, but accurate maps show
ing all the underground workings were
made, for information when the time
arrived for reopening.
In 18(58 the mine was operated by J.
R. Hardenburg, from whom it derived
its name. The shaft was sunk and the
property prosected to the depth of 80
feet, and a twenty stamp mill was
kept running on ore from this claim.
Mining was very different in those
days to what it is now, and it required
what would now be called high grade
ore to yield a profit. After running
some years it was closed down, and re
mained idle for 20 years, or until re
opened by C. D. Lane, who prospected
several hundred feet below the old
workings. It is considered on the main
gold bearing vein of the mother , lode,
and there is every reason to believe^
that with a thorough prospecting it
will take its place among the paying
mine* of tho county. In this event, it
means much for Jackson, as the vast
mineral bearing stretch from Jackson
to the Mokelumne river — a distance of
four miles is a comparatively un
touched territory as far as mineral ex
ploration is concerned. It is rich is
small seams and pockets, which have
been worked continuously, more pr
less, since early time, "but the main
ore body is comparatively untouched.
Fremont
This mine is running smoothly, the
forty stamp mill being kept steadily
at work, and the stockholders are re
ceiving dividends of two cents per
share regularly every month. The
present depth of the mine is 1650 feet,
which is not deep for mother lode
mining. It is the intention to com
mence sinking soon, and the shaft will
be carried down 300 feet deeper. Pre
parations for sinking are now being
made.
Bunker Hilt
This company paid its usual dividend
of five cents per share to its stock
holders on the 15th. The addition of
twenty stamps to the mill is waiting
on the carpenters and millwrights. Mr
Schultz, who has charge of the con
struction work, is just finishing up at
the South Eurkea, and thereafter
will devote his entire attention to the
Bunker Hill addition.
Laid to Final Rest
Mrs Hamby, wife of James Hamby
of San Francisco, passed away at the
home of her sister, Mrs Charles Koeh
ler of this city on Sunday evening last.
Mrs Hamby was the daughter of Mr
and Mrs George Merkel of Jackson,
and was 33 years of age. She had
been in ill health for several months,
and on the ninth of this month gave
birth to a boy, which still lives, an
which will be cared for and raised by
Mrs Koehler.
The remains were interred in the
protestant local cemetery on Tudesday
last, Rev. J. 0. Duncan, officiating.
Will Repair Church
Much needed repairs übout the pro
perty at the Jackson church were com
menced this week, and are expected to
be completed before inclement weather
sets in. The roof of the structure in
various places was in bad condition,
and as a result the interior of the
church is in a most deplorable condi
tion. This will all be fixed up and put
in a presentable condition.
Stork on the Job
Word has reached Jackson that Dr.
L. E. Phillips, who practiced medicine
and surgery in this city for about six
years, was presented with a baby boy
by his wife on the seventh of this
month at their home in Palo Alto.
Both mother and child are reported to
be doing finely.INtRRBD AT TnR POSTOf MO> AT .TACKSOU AS BKCOND-CLABS MATTKTI.

FRIDAY OCTOBER. 21, 1910
JOHNSON FOR GOVERNOR.
Theodore Bell is accusing bis republican opponent for
governor, Hiram Johnson, with stealing his campaign thun
der, because Bell made his canvass four years ago on an anti
railroad domination issue and anti-machine control of party
politics. According to his claims, while he was carving out
a record along these lines, Johnson was scarcely heard of in
this branch of reform. Even if this contention were correct
— which it is not — it is a very slim argument upon which to
base a claim for support at the ballot-box. If both guberna
torial candidates are running on pretty much the sains plat
form—admitting the urgency of the reforms advocated— the
vital question with voters is, which candidate, if elected,
would be mere likely to be able to give practical effect to the
reforms needed. On this point, there can be no question
that the republican standard-bearer occupies the vantage
ground. He is backed by the majority party — the party
that has a good record of achievement in the way of needed
legislation. Bell, on the other hand, is a candidate without
any party behind him worth speaking of. If elected, he would
be powerless to accomplish anything within strictly partisan
lines. There is no room to doubt that the next state legisla
ture will be strongly republican, and a democratic governor
would be helpless without the assistance of the lawmaking
body.
Bell is no doubt an able man, and sincere in his profes
sions. Like many others of his political creed, he has de
veloped a craving after office since he arrived at voting age.
Johnson, on the other hand, has been very frugal in this re
spect. This is his first venture in office-seeking, and it may
be truthfully said that he is a candidate to-day, not for the
love of political preferment, but i because he is moved thereto
by stern sense of public duty, and an earnest desire to serve
his state along well-defined lines. Johnson does not suffer
in any particular by comparison with his democratic com
petitor, Theodore- Bell.
Englebright is not the most brilliant representative this
section has had on the floor of congress; but he is one of the
hardest workers for the interests of his district. His demo
cratic opponent — Judge Raker of Modoc county — is trying
to pick flaws in his congressional record. It is a very easy
matter to charge a congressman with not having secured all
that his district wanted in the shape of appropriations. The
same complaint might apply with equal force to every district
in the United States, for as a rule every district wants a good
more of federal aid than it gets, and probably much more
than it is justly entitled to. Mr Englebright must be judged
by what he has done, not by what he has failed to do. Aside
from partyism, we believe the district would be loser by swap
ping Englebright for Raker. The democratic nominee is
superior judge of Mftdoc county, and it is against the law of
the state for one holding that position to run for congress.
This might not be a bar to his being seated if elected. The
situation is entited to serious consideration by the voters.
Why not surrender the judgeship and thereby get squarely
within the legal requirements. Keep each of these office
holders in the position he now occupies will be the better for
all concerned.
Four years ago Bell carried Amador county — with a nor
mal republican majority of fully 200— by 292 majority over
Gillett. This result was not owing to any personal prefer
ence for Bell, or prejudice against the republican candidate.
It was simply a protest registered against certain methods
of party policy, distasteful to the voters. This outcome can
not be taken as a criterion of the coming election. There is
no reason why Johnson should not carry the solid vote of
his party, and that means that he will carry the county by a
substantial majority.
The absorbing issue before the people of Araador county
is the break-up of the official clique that has been running
things with a high haud. This is more important than
aught else, just as the regulation of one's own household is
of more vital concern thau the affairs of one's neighbor.
The supervisor body cannot be materially modified at this
time, but the influences which have woiked to the detriment
of the people, and iv favor of shameful discrimination and
injustice may t>2 removed.
SCIENTIFIC

In the aeroplane of Paul Regnard,
French engineer, the gyroscope is ap
plied indirectly to give automatic sta
bility. The fly-wheel is mounted in a
gimbal frame, and an electric battery
of eight or ten cells keeps it 'in motion
in a horizontal plane at the rate of
about 10,00(1 revolutions per minute.
As the aeroplane is tipped, the gyros
cope continues to rotate in the hori
zontal plane. The vertical shaft, how
ever, makes one of four electrical
contacts, and this sets in operation the
righting mechanism, two of the con
tacts controlling the longitudinal
balance, and two the lateral balance.
The action promptly restores the
machine to its normal position. A
gust of wind, for example, may in
cline the front of the aeroplane down
ward, but the prompt closing of the
electric circuit tips the rear wings for
ward, and equilibrium is recovered.
The new beginning of life on an
isolated island is eagerly watched by
naturalists, and now the Selborne
Society has been able to study the
new flora of a building site near the
center of London. The lot was cleared
about two years ago. Since then 28
species of flowering plants and ferns
have established themselves on it, and
mosses, liverworts and other simple
plants have appeared. Besides plants
commonly distributer! by the wind, the
bracken — a fern difficult to transplant
—has sprung up, presenting a new
problem for botanists.
A novel use has been found for the
famous speech records of the Vienna
Academy of Sciences. This great col
lection of phonograms was designed to
preserve the spoken languages of all
lands, with the idioms and variations
of dialect, but on magnifying sections
of record, 1000 times, additional value
was brought out in new light on the
theory of sound. The "A" of the
man voice was shown to be differently
formed from that of the frog's croak,
while new revelations are expected
from the study of the voice in disease
and of minute variations of dialect.
That the method of taking food, as
well as the food itself, has a great
effect on the teeth has been pointed
out by Dr. J. Sim Wallace in a paper
to British dentists. Dental caries re
sult from the action of bacteria that
rapidly multiply in starch, sugar and
other fermentable carbohydrates in
contact with the teeth, and the dentist
may divide food into two classes— one
tending to leave viscous and ferment
able carbohydrates about the teeth,
and the other acting to brush them
away. This suggests that food may
be so chosen and eaten as to prevent
teeth decay. Each meal should have
sufficient hard food to stimulate masti
cation, with its excellent effect on
gums, jaws, teeth and alimentary
canal generally, and should end with
some article tending to remove the
sticky carbohydrates from teeth and
mouth. The pap-feeding of children is
to be condemned. It is suggested that
for Dreakfast fish, bacon, toast, butter,
coffee and tea should take the place of
the customary milk, porridge, bread
and marmalade; and that other meals
should have a large proportion of hard
foods;
The new bean described by Aug.
Chevalier grows underground to the
size of a very small pea in a small
region of central Dahomey, western
Africa. It proves to be a species of
Voandzeia, a genus hitherto repre
sented by only one species, which pro
duces single-seeded underground pods,
both pod and seed being edible, and is
cultivated in Brazil and Surinam as
well as over much of Africa. The new
species has been grown and sold local
ly under the name of "doi." The pod
produced at the root of the plant has
the form of a small American peanut,
and has but one or two seeds usually
white, though sometimes black, red
or variegated. They have an agree
able taste.
Hardened steel dies are produced by
electrolytic etching in a recently
patented German process. A die
block of hard steel is first made, and
this is placed in contact with a plas
ter of Paris reserve model made con
ducting by saturation with sal am
moniac. With the special dynamo,
with a capacity of 30 amperes at 1 to
15 volts, the die-block is etched to a
depth of 1-16 inch in four or five
hours.
An artificial gum which forms a
highly adhesive paste with cold water
is prepared by J. Kantorowicz, accord
ing to his French patent, by treating
dessicated starch or starchy material
with acid or alkali to increase the ad
hesiveness. Such material as potatoes

or flour is mixed with water, and then
heated— as by passage in a thin layer
over steam-heated rollers— so as to
convert the starch first into paste and
then into dessicated flakes, that can be
peeled off and ground. Hydrochloric
acid may be added to the original mix
ture in the proportion of half a pound
for each 100 pounds of potatoes, or 2
pounds of powdered sodium carbonate
for each 100 pounds of flour may be
mixed with the coarsely powdered
flaky mass from the rollers. The rol
lers have a temperature of 110 deg. to
120 deg. cent. The proportion of acid
or alkali, or other chemical reagent,
csn be varied for different degrees of
adhesiveness of the final product, and
a little experimenting may be neces
sary to get the most satisfactory re
sults.
The method of cleaning water mains
devised by R. A. Adamson, British
engineer, has been approved for its
labor-saving possibilities. An open
ing, 9 feet long, is made in the main, a
bracket is fixed to each end of the
opening, these brackets carrying two
rails and a screw of coarse pitch, and
a petrol engine is so mounted on the
rails that its shaft is central in the
tube. A scraping knife with four cut
ters is pushed along as the screw is
turned by a hand-wheel. The engine
rotates the knife as it is fed into the
pipe, the apparatus in long lengths
resembling a boring machine. As
much as 200 yards on each side of the
hole may be cleaned, and this at the
rate of about 300 yards a day.
Two ozone water-sterilizing plants
at Nice supply 40 and 80 gallons of
absolutely germ-free water per second.
The ozone generator is of copper
plates, with glass sheets between, and
the air between. the plates is decom
posed by a silent electric discharge of
10,000 volts. The nitrogenous pro
ducts being removed by a filter, tne
ozone is passed into a chamber into
which the water falls as rain through
gravel-covered netting.
Files Injunction
Ericksoii & Peterson, the railroad
contractors building the cut-off be
tween Ronklin and Clipper Gap, have
been granted a temporary injunction
against Charles Keane, state veteri
narian, enjoining him from killing any
of their horses, some of which he
charges, have glanders. Keane was
directed to appear in the superior court
at Auburn next Monday to show cause
why the temporary injunction should
not be made permanent. Erickson &
Peterson gave a bond of 8500. The
petition for an injunction sets forth
that Charles Keane on October fourth,
wilfully and unlawfully and without
right, entered the premises of Erick
son & Peterson, and threatened to kill
any or all of their horses, numbering
433. The plaintiffs say their horses
are leased, and that the state veteri
narian has no right to kill any of them
without due process of the law. —

Ratto in More Trouble
John Ratto, of the moving picture
theatre, .who has managed with the ap
proval of the powers that be, to evade
the payment of a county show license,
was pounced upon by the company fur
nishing his films. When the company
found out that he was using the same
films for different show places, the de
mand came for additional pay. There
was no alternative but to put up, or
have the picture supply shut off. To
settle the trouble he admits having to
plank down over $100. Rumor says he
paid $135, and must pay regularly here
after for the outside shows as well as
Jackson. Ratto claims that the trouble
arose over being charged for films he
did not get, and that he would have
won out had he stood trial, although
that course would have been more cost
ly than paying the claim.

Candidate's Cards
There has been some talk about the

prevent misunderstanding it may be
stated that some Gregory cards were
removed from the Argonaut mine prop
erty. This was done not from any
partisan motives, but because they
were posted without permission. The
lesson is timely. Candidates have no
right to plaster private property with
political cards without first obtaining
permission from the proper party. The
owner's rights should always be recog
nized.

Sickness Closes Schools
Three cases of scarlet fever have
developed in Amador City, one case in
three different families. The trustees
of the public school thought it advis
able to close the schools for a few
days. The school was closed last
Monday. The idea of shutting off
school facilities from the whole juve
nile population on account of a
threatened outbreak of disease of a
contagious nature, is variously com
mented upon.
Hospital Management
Hospital expenses are piling up at a
2.40 gait. For the last three months
warrants have been cancelled on the
hospital fund to the tune of $4400. No
wonder, in fixing the tax levy, the su
pervisors deemed it necewary to pro
vide more funds for this institution.
We will discuss this matter at length
in the near future.

Had to Pay License
J. F. linner, a. deputy internal rev
enue collector from Sacramento, was
in Jackson Wednesday, and after in
vestigation required Amiel Lucot, who
is local agent of the Buffalo Brewing
Companj' of Sacramento, to take out a
second federal wholesale license, and
also a retail licence. The total amount
paid was $77.50, just the amount of
licenses, without penalty. Lucot has
two distributing points for Sacramento
beer, one at Martell, the other in Jack
son. His original ilicense was taken out
for Martell, but the federal officials
held that he must have a license for
each place. He does only a wholesale
business, but his packages were found
to be one bottle short of the minimum
wholesale limit, hence the requirement
that a retail license be also taken.
New Stage to City
The old Mokelumne Hill stage line
from Jackson has been discontinued
and a new line started.
The new stage arrives in Jackson
from San Andreas each day at twelve
o'clock noon, and leaves for Moke
lumne Hill and San Andreas on its re
turn trip at one o'clock. The stage
connects with the Angels Camp stage
each day at San Andreas, thus form
ing a through trip from Jackson to
Angels Camp.
Sounds Pretty. But—
An Umpired article, purporting to
come from Amador City but bearing
the earmarks of having its origin in
interested quarters, appears in the
Sutter Creek Record this week. We
propose to reprint the "vindication"
next week, with comment, as a timely
campaign document.

Edward Davey met a horrible death
Satuiday morning while working at
the Angels mine Davey was employed
as a machinist, and was ascending
from the 400- foot level to the 100-foot
level when he knocked a plate loose by
moving the bell rope. The plate
knocked him from the skip ar.d he
fell down the shaft, a distance of 600
feet, landing in forty feet of sump.
He died before he could be rendered
assistance. The deceased was 1 30 years
of age, and leaves a widow and two
children.— Citizen.
A short time ago Tony Susanna, an
Indian living at Carson Hill, hired a
horse and buggy from Segale brothers
of Murphys and kept it out for a
longer time than contracted for.
When it was finally recovered, it was
found that the animal had been
abused, and a warrant was issued for
the arrest of Susanna, who was taken
before the justice of Murphys town
ship. A date of hearing was set and
the prisoner was allowed his ;liberty
on his own recognizance. On the date
set for the hearing, the Indian failed
to appear in court, and a bench
warrant was issued. On last Thurs
day morning, constable Ernil Schwoerer
went to the home of Sasanna and ar
rested him. After talking about the
matter for a few miuntes, Sasanna
told the officer that he wanted to get a
clean collar and stepped into another
room. He then took a loaded shotgun
and placing the muzzle under his «hin,
reached down and pulled the trigger,
the shot struck him under the chin,
ranging upward, tearing away his jaw
and face and the top of his head, from
the effects of which he died several
hours later. Susanna was born and
reared here, and was about 25 years of
age. He leaves a wife and one child.

On the strength of advice received
from Sutter €reek, constable Cosgrove
on Thursday arrested Janko Vu6co
vich, an Austrian miner, and held him
until the arrival of constable Tuttle
from that place, with a warrrant, later
in the day. Vucovich's arrest was
caused by a boarding house keeeper,
who alleged that the defendant was
trying to jump his board bill. Ac
cording to Vucovich's story, his case
was a peculiar one. An attachment
suit, it appears, was brought against
him by the undertaker at Sonora to
recover an amount alleged to be due
for the burial of his brother. He dis
puted the claim, and when he wbb
served with a numinous, he showed it
to his boarding housa master, ex
plaining that it waß an unjust de
mand. Tho master advised him to go to
Sonora, nevertheless, and fight ths
case. Acting upon this advice, he
started on the journey, but had not
more tha reached Angels Camp when
his accommodating counselor caused
his arrest for omitting to pay
his board bill before starting. With a
judgment by default threatening his
non-appearance at one end of the line
and a criminal action commanding him
to return to the other end, his plight
may be compared to a position "be
tween the devil and the deep sea. "—

ONLY ONE "BEST"
Jackson People Give Credit -Where
Credit Is Due..
People of Jackson who suffer with
sick kidneys and bad backs want a
kidney remedy that can be depended
upon. The best is Doan's Kidney
Pills, a medicine for the kidneys only,
made from pure roots and herbs, and
the only one that is backed by cures
in Jackson. Here's Jackson testi
mony :
Mrs J. Bastian, 60 Pitt street, Jack
son. Cal. says: "In my opinion,
there is no other kidney remedy equal
to Doan's Kidney Pills. Their value
for ■ relieving pain in the back and
other symptoms of kidney trouble was
thoroughly proven in my case about
three years ago, and at that time I
publicly recommended them. Since
then, another member of my family
has taken Doan's Kidney j*ills, pro
cured from the City Pharmacy, and
has received relief from kidney com
plaint My advice to anyone afflicted
with this trouble is to give Doan's
Kidney Pills a trial."

JUDGE SLOSS
VERY ABLE
Qualified In Every Re
spect and Highly
Honored
There is always room for an honest
difference of opinion on matters of
public policy, and in the minds of
many honest republicans, there is a
question as to the wisdom of incor
porating in the state republican plat
form those advanced ideas, so
called, first promulgated by the popu
list party of a few years ago. But,
after all, it is not possible that all re
publicans or republican newspapers,
reflecting or leading public opinion,
should agree. The whole country
seems to be suffering from a surfeit
of political ideas, and while we all be
lieve in political as well as commer
cial and social progress, we cannot ac
comodate ourselves to all the isms ad
vocated within wide range of , thought,
between ultra conservatism on the one
hand and ultra radicalism on the other.
We believe, however, that most of i
us can agree on one proposition, and
that is, the policy of creating a non
partisan judiciary. The people, as a
whole, are jealous of the reputation
and standing of the supreme court of j
the state and in their selection of can
didates are prone to ignore politics ;
but there ought not to be any conten
tion as to the advisability of re-elect
ing Judge M. C. Slo3s, as associate
justice of that eminently respectable
body of judges, the supreme court of
California. The peculiar fitness of
Judg* Sloss, by reason of his mature
age, vigorous manhood, judicial tem
perament, experience and profound
learning, would seem to be apparent
to all who have a knowledge of that
gentleman's record. With the people,
the selection of a judge is a matter of
personal fitness and not of partisan
ship. Is he a just judge? Is his as
sociation of such a character that he
has not become biased? Does he favor
the corporation or the people's view
point? Has he that judicial mind and
fairness as will enable him, in his de
cisions, to deal justly as between the
interests of labor and of capital? Is
he fearless to render a just decision
without regard to popular and often
incompetent criticism? No man, what
ever his condition of life may be
should demand or expect more than a
square deal, and the honest elector
will always cast his vote in favor of
the judge who will adoDt the square
deal as his policy.
In considering the candidacy of
Judge Sloss regarding these qualifica
tion, we can only judge his future re
cord by what it has been in the past.
Since Judge Sloss has been on the
supreme bench, he has written many
decisions, several of them peculiarly
characteristic of his fairness, notably
his decision entitled ex-parte Martin,
rendered in 1909, which was of great
importance to miners and smelter
men. This decision upheld the con
stitutionality of the act limiting the
hours of labor of underground miners
and smeltermen, to eight hours per
day. Another decision by Judge Sloss,
of vital interest to all classes of labor
employed in mills and factories, up
held the validity of the employers
liability law. These decisions simply
illustrate the fairness ar.d fitness of
Judge Sloss for the position he seeks,
and his large plurality vote in the
primaries indicates that the people
already recognize these facts.

SIX NAMES
Members of Election
Board Pcmovcd. No
Reason Given
It may not be generally known that
at the last meeting of the board of
supervisors, when officers of election
had to hi appointed, changes were
made in the original list submitted to
the boarti by supervisor Strohm of this
district, as regards 'the precincts
within Jackson city limits. Among
the names submitted by the supervisor
were the following: Ben Gilbert, J.
H. Turner, Thos Lernin, A.'Hambrick,
H. D. Emerson and J. J. Dalo. The
list was revised by the democratic
politicians and office holders who as
sume to control things, and when pre
sented to the board for action, all
these names were dropped, and others,
to wit, T. Hedgpeth, J. E. Batchelder,
George Weller, W. Ji Nettle jr., Jas
Harris, and M. M. Matson substituted
therefor. Several of those discarded
inquired of Strohm 'why they were re
moved. His only explanation was that
the clique did it. "Well," why didn't
you object to any interference with
your official duties?" In reply, he
said in substance, that in that event
he would have had the whole clique to
fight.
The handwriting of the revised list
was recognized and the writer stated
that he really did not know who was
responsible for the changes or why
they were made.
Naturally, tnose removed are ex
ceedingly wrothy, not because of the
tew dollars they would receive for
their services, but because of being
shut out unceremoniously without any
excuse being forthcoming. And they
are now out with their hatchets and
will make their work count against
one or two aspirants when the ballots
are counted.

Bell's Foolish Argument
In his appeal to the voters, Mr Bell
repeatedly ha 3 said :
"California cannot enjoy a stable
administration of affairs unless the
man who is elected governor has be
hind him a united party. If 1 am
elected, 1 shall not be obstructed or
disturbed by factional disturbance in
my party."
Since Mr Bell has used this argu
ment several times, undoubtedly its
absurdity does not appeal to him. It
is a poor argument for the election of
Mr Bell, that he would not be dis
turbed by factonal differences, when
the fact is that he would not have be
hind him even a semblance of a party
disturbed or otherwise. TheJCalifornia
legislature is overwhelmingly republi
can. The most potent force in the re
publican party of the state is Hiram
W. Johnson. Within his party, he has
shown his ability to effect reforms
that are in the interest of the whole
people. In carrying out tne pledges
of the republican platform, he will
have the backing of an overwhelming
majority in the legislature elected up
on tin. same platform. There can be
no question of his ability to carry out
the reforms which tiie people demand.
Granting Mr Bell every high pur
pose, the fact that he belongs to the
party of the diminishing minority is
not an argument for his election.
Evsry year a large number of poor
sufferers whose lungs- are sore and
raked with coughs are urged to go to
another climate. But this is costly
and not always sure. There's a better
way. Let Dr. King's New Discovery
cure you at home. "It cured me of
lung trouble.," writes W. R. Nelson,
of Calamine, Ark., "when all else
failed, and 1 gained 47 pounds in
weight.. Its surely .the king of all
coughs and lung cures." Thousands
owe their lives and health to it. Its
positively guaranteed for coughs,
colds, la grippe, asthma, croup — all
throat and lung troubles. 50 cents and
$1. Trial bottle free at Spagnoli's
drug store.
Big Band of Goats
A large band of angora goats passed
through Jackson Wednesday morning,
bound for a ranch near San Andreas,
Calaveras county. There were 2100 in
the flock, .the largest band of these
animals that has been seen in this
sec 1 ion for many years. They , are
owned by Louis Joses, of San Andreas,
who with an assistant, was driving
them to his home place. He left home
about three weeks ago to bring the
goats from Tehama county, where he
had purchased them. He has been on
the road ever since, and expeced to
reach home Thursday. The goats were
in fine condition, they had all been
recently sheared of their crop of wool.
Mr- Joses bought them as a specula
tion, and for raising them to some ex
tent. There is a demand for goat meat
on the part of the Austrian boarding
houses and others. They cure the
meat by smoking, etc, and it is con
sidered equal if not preferable to beef.
The goats will weigh full grown about
100 pounds, and will command from
$2.50 to $3 a head. The hide with
'wool thereon is low in price, worth
: about 35 cents.
It is in time of sudden mishap or ac
cident that Chamberlain's liniment can
be relied upon to take the place of the
family doctor, who cannot- always be
found at the moment. Then it is that
Chamberlain's liniment is never found
wanting. In cases of sprains, cuts,
wounds and bruises, Chamberlain's
liniment takes the soreness and drives
away the pain. Sold by all dealers.
Effect of Tariff Charges.
Not for many years has the price
of cattle, fit for the butchers, been so
high as now. Butchers in this section
have to pay 9 cents per pound on the
hoof. This is the highest rate touched
within the knowledge of those now in
that business. And they are hard to
get even at this fancy price. It is also
ncteworthy, that while the price of
cattle is thus soaring, the price of
hides has declined. Butchers are not
able to get more than 8 cents per
pound for hides whereas a years ago.
the rate was 9 cents. This reduction
is accounted for by the tariff being
tuken on: hides. The imported hides
fix the market rate for the domestic
article. This is one effect of the free
list business— the reduced tariff of the
Payne-Aldrich bill. It is extremely
doubtful, however, whether the con
sumer will reap any benefit whatever
from this reduction. The only ones
benefitedare apt to be the importers of
the foreigh hide.
ANY LADY can easily make from
$18.00 to $25.00 per week working for

Indistinct Echo
The E«'ho of last week has this to
say about John Daneri, who is running
on the democratic ticket for coroner
and public administrator :
Mr Daneri is a resident of Sutter
Creek, : where he was born and grew to
manhood. He is engaged in the under
taking, business in that thriving town.
He lias, had considerable training in
the office to which he aspires, having
served three years as a deputy under
Geo. M Huberty, in Jackson, so that
he will bring to the office, if elected,
plenty of experience to prevent
blunders.
That the candidate served as deputy
coroner for tnree years in Jackson
under the last administration is cer
tainly news to the people here. There
is no record of such appointment as
deputy.
Reaching the Top
in., any calling of life, demands a
vigorous body and a keen brain.
Without health there is no success.
But Electric Bitters is the ' greatest
health builder the world has ever
known. It compels perfect action of
stomach, liver, kidneys bowels, puri
fies and enriches the blood, tones and
invigorates the whole system and en
ables you to stand the wear and tear
of your daily work. After months of
suffering from kidney trouble." writes
W. M. Snerman, of Cusuhing, Me.,
"three bottles of Electric bitters made
me feel like a new man." 50c. at

New Graft a Success
EL M. Prine,. of West Point, Cala

successful in his attempt to graft
chestnuts into* Oak trees. As a result
of hiß experiments,, this year for the
first time; the trees seem to be bear
ing, and the nut in tho onk ha* a
doublb burr in it. Although tho burs
are in the embryo,, he is sure that
they will be found to contain chest
nuts* Price's experiments received
considerable attention about a year
ago, when they were given publicity in
The Bee. At that time, it was an
nounced that he- had succeeded in
grafting walnuts into oaks, and; as a
result he was flooded with questioning,
letters from all parts of the country.
What he actually did was to cross
English walnuts with the California
walnut, producing a very large nut of
excellent meat. His experiments with
the chestnut and' oak are made with
the idea of growing-; in this state chest
nuts in sufficient quantities to be a
factor as a foodstuff. The chestnut in
Italy, he- points out,, is very generally/
used a» a food. If his- present experi
ments prove as successful as- he ex
pects,, he plans to have all the
now practically useless, oak trees that
abound in the state growing a chestnut
