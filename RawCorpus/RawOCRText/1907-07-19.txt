The Diseases of Industry.— Shooting
Blood from the Eye. — Paper (Jears.
— Musio as Electricity.— Copper on
Ulass Mirrors.— A Big Earthquake
Recorder.— Anti-Opium Tea Flea.-
Borne Tapeworms.— A High Heat
Thermometer.
Last year in passing aoyect making
employers responsible tor diseases in
workmen resulting from the special
work, the British Parliament re
cognized six "industrial diseases,"
viz. : anthrax, lead poisoning, mer
cury poisoning, phosphorus poison
ing, arsenic poisoning, and anky
lostomiasis or miner's worm. The
home secretary was given power to
extend the list, and a oommittee of
inquiry has recommended these addi
tions: .Poisoning by nitro and amido
derivatives of benzene (dinitro-benzol
anilin and others); poisoning by car
bon bisulphide; poisoning by nitrous
fumes, 'poisoning nickel carbonyl;
poisoning by African boxwood, chrome
uloeration; eczematous ulueration of
skin from dust or corrosive liquids,
oi ulceration of nose or moutu from
dust; cancer or ulceration ot skin, or
of the oorneal surface of the eye from
tbr or pitch; compressed air illness.
An extraordinary reptile habit is,
described in a new bonk by K. L.
Ditmars, of the New York Zoological
Park. A large Mexican horned lizard,
excited by an attempt to measure it,
emitted a rasping sound and expelled
a jet of blood, which struck a wall
four feet away and formed a trail of
103 spots along the floor. Ihe blood
came from the eyelid, momentarily
much swollen. Shooting blood from
tbe eye has been long attributed to
tbis creature, but it seems so rare that
naturalists have doubted its reality.
The best gear wheels have been
shown by the test of a British firm
to be those made from a high-grade
Manila paper. They are foimed in
1,000 ton hydraulic presses, are
stronger and more elastic than cast
iron, lighter than rawhide, noiseless,
almost fnctionless, and wors without,
vibration.
The telbarmonium of Dr. Cabill
produces music from electricity with
out the aid of any musical instru
ment, while on tbe other hand the
apparatus of Dr. M. Dupont, a French
electrician, converts music into elec
tric currents. To a phonograph Dr.
Dupont fits a microphone in circuit
with tbe primary of an induction coil
without its interrupter. The musical
scale or a piece of music is recorded
in the phonograph, and on reproduc
tion tbis transforms the miorophone
current into an alternating current
with periods changing to correspond
to the vibrations of the musical notes.
The alternating current gives the
physiological effects of hearing music.
Practice will probably enable a person
to recognize the musical pieces by
tbe currents, and deaf mates may be
given a means of hearing, while it is
expected that tbe varying action on
the mind of exciting and calming
pieces may prove of value in treating
nervous patients.
Copper very closely resembles silvei
in many respects, bat hitherto no
method has been known of depositing
it from aqueous solutions on glass so
as to form mirrors like those so long
made with silver. This is now accom
plished by reducing cuprio oxide by
an aqueous solution of phenyl hydra
zine in presence of potassium hydro
xide. Some mirrors made in tbis way
have been shown to tbe London Koyal
Society by Dr. F. D. Chattaway, aud
have a coherent metallic film as
brilliant and uniform as that of the
silver-on-glass reflectors used in tele
scopes, aud more beautiful on account
of the color.
Tbe ordinary seismograph, or earth
quake recorder, registers the motion
of the earth under a "stationary"
pendulum of 100 or 200 pounds. A
uew instrument by Dr. Wiechert,
made at Gottingen, has a suspended
pendulum weighing nearly seventeen
tone, and a series of levers causes its
indicator to magnify tbe earth motion
2200 times. So sensitive is tbe
apparatus tbat it showed tremors due
to a gas engine located a mile and a
half away.
The fact that we have nerve stimu
lants so pleasant and safe as tea and
coffee seems to justify the hope that
some substitute for alcohol end opium
may be found that will lessen tbe
evils now caused by these narcotics.
Possibly the looked for agent may
prove to be some new alkaloid of the
Combretum sundaicum, a forest vine
of tbe Malay peninsula. A decoction
of the leaves tried for tea by some
Chinese wood-cutters surprised them
by creating a distaste for tbeir opium
smoke, and since then the decoction
mixed with roasted opium— the pro
portion of tbe latter being reduced
daily-is claimed to have caused
nearly four hundred opium smokers
to abandon their habit, [and to have
decreased the opium imports into the
district of tbe experiment by more
than thirty chests per month.
Further tests will be necessary to
prove that the Combretum tea is as
effective and harmless as supposed.
and whether it will destroy tbe
craving for alcohol as well as that for
opium.
Fleas are not recommended as an
article ot diet, as it has been shown

NEW RULING ON POST CARDS.
Washington, July 12.— For years
Americana and others have been send
ing to tbe United States from foreign
countries postal carMs and post cards
(private mailing cards) with messages
written upon the front as well as
upon the back of the cards, although
in this country this advantage has
been denied the uaera of government
poatal cards. Some months ago the
United States postal laws and regula
tions were amended so as to give tbat
privilege to buyers of post cards, but
such a concession was not made
applicable to postal carda. in order
to revoke this inconsistency and to
prevent further confusion and annoy
ance to the public postmaster General
Meyer to-day promulgated an order
effective August 1, 1907, providing
tbat the face side of a postal card
may be divided by a vertical line
placed one-third ot the distance from
the left end of the card, tbe space to
be used for a message, etc. The por
tion to the right to be used for the
address only. A very thin sheet of
paper may be attached it it adheres
to the card and such a postal may
bear both writing and printing. Ad
vertisements, illustrations or writing
may appear upon the back of tbe
card and upon tbe left third of the
front.
Postals bearing particles of glass,
metal, or other such sub
stances are declared to be unmail
able. except when enclosed in en
velopes with proper postage, or when
treated in such a manner as will pre
vent tbe materials from being rubbed
off or injuring tbe hands of tbe per

Iv connection with the matter of
the preference right of actual settlers
upon the laud, this office entered
into corrospocdence with the Ueneial
Land Office in VVashintgon, L). C,
with the result that the following
letter was received :
"Department of the Interior,
Ueueral Laud Office, Washington, 1).
C, July 1, 1907. Instructions to
local land ufflce. Kegister and Re
ceiver, Sacramento, California. Sirs:
I am in receipt of your letter of June
11, 1907, in which you request in
structions relative tc the disposition
of lands which had formerly been
withdrawn for forestry purposes but
which have been restored to settle
ment and will be open to entry at a
later date, and you refer to a restora
tion to settlement on Dec. 14, 1906,
while the lands will not be open until
Aug. 15, 1907.
"In reply you are advised that this
distinction was made in order to
protect bona ride settles and to give
them an opportunity to go on said
land?, select a claim, and make
settlement thereon, and upon the
lauds, being thrown open to entry
they would be given a preference
right tor ninety days within which to
Ule their claims, the same as they
would be upon the filing of a town
ship plat of survey in your office, and
you will treat applications in the
ordinary way upon tne township
being open to entry under the general
laud laws.
"If, however, the township was sur
veyed prior to withdrawal for forestry
purposes, upon restoration of the
same sections 16 and 36 would im
mediately revert to the state, unless
a settlement had been made prior to
the survey of said township.
Very respectfully, Fred Dennett,
Acting commissioner.
Hoard of Law Review by H. J. Gray.
From the above letter it will be
seen that a settler upon the land has
tbe preference right of homestead
entry for the period of ninety days
and iv consequence it will not be
necessary for au actual settler to be
at tbis office and iv line at the day
and hour ot opening. He may pro
perly execute his papers before the
superior judge or county clerk (not
his deputy) as soou alter nine o'clock
a. m., August 15, 1907., as practic
able, being particular thereiu to use
blank forms i— oo7. 4—062, i— 063 aud
4—089, tilling in all blanks aa thereiu
directed aud indicated and forward
the papers to this office with the
necessary fees (which is sixteeu
dollars for a IGO acre homestead) as
soou as practicable after the date and
hour of opening.
It is advisable that all settlers upon
land, immediately after they effect
their settlement, scud a notion to thi.s
uffica stating the description of the
laud upou which they have settled.
This request is made for the reason
that it will tacilitate the twsioesa of
this office and may possibly, be ot
some advantage to tho settler. .
All homestead applications ma do
by a naturalized citizen must be
accompauied by a certified copy of
naturalization papers.

On Monday a committee from tbe
miuers' uniuu cf Ibis town called on
the owners of the Utica mine, going
to the city for that purpose. lhey
were intonned that no concession
whatever would be made aud were
also told that the owners weie not
anxious to reopen the mines, as they
wero making money Dy remaining
closed. Ou Thursday a committee
composed ot J. E. Baker, Johu Heard
and John Peirano called on superin
tendent Alex Chalmers of the
Ligbtner mine here, asking that a
satisfactory understanding be had, in
order tbat tbo trouble be settled. Mr
Chalmers informed the committee
that tbe only basis for a settlement
would be that the men return to work
under the same conditions as prevail
ed at the time of the strike was called
but that no shorter bours would be
granted, and that no recognition of
the uniun would be given. In view
ot the fact that James V. Columan of
tbe Angels mine, haa also declined to
grant any of the demands made by
the union, the prospect for a reopen
ing of tbe mines does not appear to
be very bright, unless tbe men are
willing to go to work under the
former conditions.— Angels Keoord.

The Ground Is Alive.
We are so used to thinking of the soil
as mere mineral matter that it comes
quite as a shock to find this Is a mis
take. As a matter of fact, the layer of
soft mold which clothes the ground in
all cultivable districts aud from which
vegetation springs is actually in great
part a living layer of tiny plants and
animals. Interlacing threads of molds
and fungi, worms and grubs, creeping

Elephant Life In the Jungles.
kthout elephants jungles would be
ally Impassable. The great beasts
are a mixture of strength and weak
ness, of craft and simplicity. The
paths through the jungle from village
to village are merely tracks from which
the interlacing foliage has been cut
and thrust aside and the virgin soil
trodden into a black mud. After a
rain this mud is many feet deep, and
no living creature except an elephant,
a buffalo or a rhinoceros could labor
through it. The elephant makes his
way by lifting one foot at a time and
inserting it deep into the slough in
front, withdrawing another with a
sound like the popping of a huge cork.
Nothing but a ride on an earthquake

Ice on the Moon.
The moon has been much
and it is sometimes said that ita sur
face is better known than tbe geo
graphy of certain parts of the earth.
In spite of this, however, says the
London Globe, there is still much
difference of opinion as to its real
nature aud the cause of those opera
tions which have loft their marks so
conspicuously upon it. Prot. Picker
ing, for example, has recently con
cluded, from certain changes which
take place in the appearance of
certain parts, that the old theory of a
worn-out cinder, where nothing ever
happens, must be discarded. He
considers, that is to say, tbat thore ia
proof of present-day lunar volcanic
activity as well as evidence of vegeta
tion.
And in his recently published
work," The Moou in Modern Astron
omy," Philip Fauth 6ets forth a new
view of the moon's institution. In
the first place, the author dwells on
tbe difficulty of interpreting tbe
appearances of tbe moon's surface in
terms of terrestrial volcanology. The
so-calied volcanoes of tbe moon can
not, he thinks, be due to the causes
which have produced those of tbe
earth. Their enormous relative size,
for example, is difficult to explain on
the view that they are tbn result of
similar forces. One of tbe lunar
features, known to astronomers as
Clavius, bas a diameter of 142 miles,
and is inolosod by walls three miles
bigb. When this is compared with
tbe average size of the terrestrial
volcano, and when it ia remembered
that the earth is fifty times us large
as the moon, the difficulty of ao
counting for lunar "volcanoes" by
forces similar to those which have
produced tbe volcanoes of the earth
is apparent. And tbat the moou,
although so much smaller than tbe
earth, should have mountain peaks
rising to greater heights than those of
the Himalayas is another difficulty.
To account, then, for the known
phenomena of tbe moon, Mr Fauth
proposes tbe following lunar theory:
Our satellite must be covered with a
tbick layer of loe, for nothing else,
be declares, will account for tbe ap
pearances he bas observed during the
fourteen days lunar day. Beneath
this crust of ice is an ocean, which
by its motions, due to tide?, etc., bas
produced the scarred and fractured
surface v.itn which we are familiar,
luside these shells of ice and water
lies a soild nucleus, which may be
looked upou as tho real moon. L'be
author of this new theory agrees with
tbe older view that the moon has
no atmosphere. But it is difficult to
understand how it could have a sur
face of solid water without a conse
quent envelope of water vapor.
Evaporation would take place from
Ihe surface of the ice, forming an
aqueous atmosphere, from which the
moisture would be continually re
turned by precipitation as snow.

Not Payable from Salary Fund.
W We pointed out last week that the
m monthly bills presented by the super
vvisprs tor services as road commiss-
i ioners, amounting to 525 per month
e each, are not iv compliance • with
l lanl,n 1 , ii);i-uiu3b as the . same are un-
itemized and uuveritk-d. lint they
hava been allowed aud paid in this
-I), me for a long period ot time. If
the heads of the county management
are so careless in legaid to the
method of presenting their own
olttlOM. how can they be expected to
Keep^close to the live with respect to
other claimants. We now call atten-,
tion to another matter concerning
these fiills for toad commissioners'
pay. It will be noticed that tbey are
allowed and paid out of the salary
tuufl. Now a claim Un salary does
not tr.ive to be presented to the board
of supervisors. The fixed salary ot
couuty oltijials is payable by warrant
issued directly by tbe auditor upon
tbe treasurer. The supervisors get
their salaries as supervisors in this
way, without tbe formality of putting
in a bill before their own body, and
allowing tbe same. Even township
utlioers, such as constables ana
justices, dra.v their salaries in this
way. These aie charges definitely
fixed by law, and tberefoie not sub
■ ject to revision by the county mana
gers, but witb regard to compens
tiou Tor road commissioners a differ
ent course is followed. And tui
very fact is an acknowledgment that
tbe money they draw month after
month for road services is not in the
nature of fixed salary, notwithstand
ing the tact that the unvarying sum
drawn, and the fund from which it is
drawn, would lead to that conclusion.
If it is a salary iv the strict sense of
tbe wcrd, the supervisors do not have
to make out bills therefor. If it is
not a salary, the bills must be item
ized and vended, and should not be
drawa against tbe salary fund.
We have no hesitation in asserting
that the compensation cannot proper-
ly be classed under tbe heading of
salary. The road commissioner is
allowed 33 per day for time actually
put iv on tbe roads. (Jills for such
services are supposed to show (he
particular days spent in tbe work,
on what portions of the highways,
and other details, and tbe same must
ba sworn to as other bills. Further
more such claims, so allowed, should
be drawn, as we understand it, against
tbe road funds of tbe respective dis
tricts, and not against the salary
fund. We can Hud uo express law to
this effect, bat it is tbe only tenable
position. Tbe per diem for ihe
road commissioner of ioad district
one, should come out of the road
fund of that district, aud no other
fund, and so on through all the dis
tricts. Udder the old system of road
overseer, the law expressly stated
that his compensation of three dollars
per day should ba drawn from tbe
road fund of bis district. And tbe
supervisor as road commissioner
stands squarely in the same position
in this matter.
But it may be asked, what differ
ence does it make whether the money
is drawn fiom tbe district road fund
or tbe salary fund? We reply that it
makes a very material difference, and
the taxpayers of the entire county are
vitally interested in maintaining tbe
distinction. Tbeie is no special levy
for the salary fund. That fund is
made up from the current expense
fund. Money is transferred from the
current expense fund to tbe salary
fund as necessity arises. The whole
enrrent expense fund is back of the
salaries of county officials. All por
tions of tbe couuty contribute pro
rata to tbat fund— tbe wealthiest por
tions of tbe county of course, furnish
ing the greater portion. But the
money from tbe general road fund is
apportioned to tbe various districts
iv proportion to the taxable property
in the respective districts; road dis
tricts one and two, under this
arrangement, getting considerably
more money for road maintenance
than road distiict three, in keeping
with the difference in the property
values in tbe districts. Now by
drawing the road commissioner's
compensation from the salary fund
tbe money for road maintenance
» is swelled to tbe extent of $1500 per
year over aud above tbe regular levy
for road purposes. In other words,
by this slick method the supervisors
have the entire road funds of their
respective districts to handle in pay
ment for labor and supplies, falling
bank upon the general fund for their
per diem of three dollars, the same as
for their salary as supervisors.
Not only this, but a more serious
objection against tbe system is tbat
tbe burden of road maintenance is
thereby improperly and illegally dis
tributed. Tbe wealthier districts are
thereby compelled to pay an uudue
share of tbe ioad expenses of the
sparsely settled districts. Townships
one, two and four are made to con
tribute tbe major part of tbe road
commissioners' per diem in townships
three and five. A great injustice is
thereby done a cortain portion ot tbe
county tor the benefit of the other
portion. Tbe system is just as
reprehensible as though tbe "burden
of paying teachers salaries were:

Equalization a Farce.
The big oorporations representing
tbe large vested interests ot Amador
county, in mining and other indus
tries, were disappointed at the out
come of the proceedings before the
board of equalization last Monday.
There were a number ot mining and
othar compauies before the board
asking for a reduction ot assessment.
Mad all these requests been granted
it would have cut down the assess
ment roll over 8200,000. i.'ho showing
in nearly every case presented was
conclusive tbat a reductiou was only
reasonable and fair, and tbat tbe duty
of the board sitting for tbe express
purpose of equalizing the burden of
taxation was plainly in tbe direction
of granting relief. Of course, if
the burden were taken off in tbe cases
brought to the attentiou of tbe board
it would impose so much additional
burden upon the holders whose
assessment stood at tbe figures return
ed by the assessor. But thai tact
ought not to be taken into considera
tion. If a piece ot property is
assessed too]mucb in comparison witb
other similar property, why it ought
to be lowered. Now, it was pointed
out in several instances that increased
valuation had been made arbitrarily,
without any reason for the raise
whatever, other than a demand by
popular clamor. Property that had
gone out ot existence years ago
vanished iv smoke or uou usage, was
kept on tbe rolls and made to sur
render its quota to tbe demands of
tbe toll gatherer, and tjhe equalizers
took no step 3 whatever to remedy tbe
wrong. It had been going on in one
case at least, for years, simply be
cause no complaint bad been made
thereat, and when tbe complaint whs
formally presented it was turned
down, as much as to say that inas
much as tbe parties aggrieved had
been silent for years, its toleration
by tbe official remedial board for
another year was a small matter.
There was too much ot this unreason
ing spirit to stand by the figures of
the assessor, right or wrong, and
relegate tbe adjustment of inequali
ties to that officer for the next year.
Another thing that struck the
spectator as funny was the conteu
tion to stand strictly on the condi
tions existing on the Ist of March as
fixing the value of property for assess
ment purposes. Of course, tbe law
oad to lay dowu some lixed time tor
the basis of valuation. A moment's
reflection will suggest the necessity
of that plan. For instance, it uo
definite time were stated, movable
property would be able to escape
taxation, by migrating. But wher
ever it is located on the Ist of March
it was to be assessed at that point.
It does cot follow, however, that tbe
valuation lor assessments i's absolute
ly fixed by the conditions ou tbat
date. The law does not mean any
thing of tbe kind. Tbe laws are to
be liberally construed, witb a view
of promoting justice. If property
existed iutact on the Ist day ot
March, and on the following day was
utterly wiped out by tire or other
calamity, will auy sane man contend
that tbe assessor ought to list it, and
tbe board of equalizers make tbe
owner pay taxes tbereou, juat the
same as though it had never been
destroyed. That would be" unjust,
and therefore it is not law. The
earthquake and tire in San Francisco,
occurred April 18th least year. Ac
cording to the strict interpretation
held to by many, the assessment
valuation in that city last year ought
not to bave been affected in tho least
degree by that great disaster, wbich
occurred six weeks after March 1.
But we know full well that the
destruction did affect the assessment
roll, -shrunk it up by hundreds ot
millions of dollars. And who will
say, tbat such action was not justified
by the ciroumstanues. The rule
should have the same application
everywhere. If a mine was barely
paying expenses on March Ist, and
from that time showed a heavy deficit,
is it not right that the equalizing
board should take cognizance of the
facts aud act accordingly.

heard perhaps by rumor. The tact
-vas he died by heart failure. William
Uickens, who was with Mr Schillings
wheujhe died, says Mr Schillings went
nit to feed his horses, aud 1 was a
little ahead of Nick. He ran to catch
uo with me, and felt a severe pain
over his heart. 1 took him into a
saloon and got him a diiuk of whisLy
md he felt easier. So we weut on
out to the stable and when we got
there the pain came back with vigor,
and he Eat dowu on the ground. 1
said to him, "If you are sick, Nick,
you had better go up aud lie down ou
the bed." As 1 spoke he fell over,
and 1 sent one of the men for a
rioctnr. By the time we got Nick ou
the bed, the doctor came, and said he
was dying of heart failure. Almost
bis last words were an appeal to his
sister, who in his delirium ha
thought ivas near, "lieitie! hold my
hands." Then he said appealiugly,
and iv a whisper "whiskey," aud he
ivas dead. Mr Schilling was well aud
favorably known arouud about Oleta
aud viciuity. He was a man ot sterl
ing qualities, prompt and honorable
in all his dealings, and a worthy
citizen iv every way. He was v
brother-in-law of John Votaw, who
married a sister. Strangely he aud
Mr Votaw were partners in business
at Forest Home, and died withiu a
few days of eacu other. Mr Votaw 1
knew from his boyhood. He grew
into manhood well liked by almost
every one. He leaves a yjife and tour
children to nionru his uutimeiy death.

BOARD OF EQUALIZATION
A Rush of Applications for Reduc-
tions by Corporations.
JLhe final meeting of tbe supervis
ors, sitting as a board of equaliza
tion, nas held last Monday— that day
being the last upon which the bonrd
oould hear applications for reduction
or increase, being required to turn
over tbe assessment 1011 at VI o'clock
midnight. As expected there was a
rush of applicants for reduction,
almost exclusively by the corpora
tions. There whs an array of lawyers
on hand alao to represent tbe dis
satisfied property holders.
The first application heard was that
of tbe Central Eureka, which applied
for a reduction from 1120,000, the
tigures returned by tbe assessor, to
875,000. \V. J. McGee represented
the company.
(J. E. Jarvis was sworn and stated
that last year tbe properiy was
assessed for $180,000. tie said he had
assessed on a basis of 50 per cent of
the quoted price of the stock on the
Ist of March, tie admitted that tbe
mine was not paying dividends, but
he thought a reduction of SGO.OOO in
one yeat was fair.
Superintendent E. Hampton testi
fied that tbe mine was not looking
well; tbat it had been running be
hind for several months. It was a
small claim, having only 800 or 900
feet along the lode line. Xbe shaft
was in bad shape, and there was noth
ing in sight to warrant expectations
tbat tbe property would again pay
dividends. it was shown that tbe
company had run behind about
£10.000 in the last six months, lie
considered $'i 5,000 was a big assess
ment for a mine la the condition of
the Central Eureka, especially In
view of the fact tbat dividend paying
mines, such as tbe Hunker tiill and
tbe Fremont were assessed at a muob
less figure, tbe Hunknr Hill for $63,
000, and the b'remont 885,000.
Hayward and Hobart Estate.
Tbe agents of this property asked for
;i reduction from 810,000 to 87,000, tbe
same figures as last year, on tbe 8
mining claims in Plymouth district.
They had been idle for many years,
were abandonod mines. Mr. H.
Myers, tbe agent looking after tbe
properties, testified in favor of the
reduction. He said no demaud bad
been made upon him for a sworn
statement. He refused to sign the
statement made by the assessor, for
reason that be considered the assess
ment of tbe mines too N bigb.
Zeila Mining Co.
W. If. Detert asked for a reduction
iromS 58.000 to §38,000. The property
was assessed for the latter figure last
year, ibis year tho valuation was
increased 320,000. The assessor said
that be assessed it in that way be
cause he thought it was fair, and in
accordance with . other property
valuatiuns.'
W. t\ Detert and Thos. Hydenfeldt,
B. b\ Taylor and \V, Harvey testiUed
in favor of a reduction. It was
shown that tbe mine bad not paid a
dividend for three years; that when
it-did pay a dividend it did not ex
ceed 312000. There were 20,000 shares
in the compauy. It has been operated
continuously for 27 yeaia. During
this time it bad paid to stockholders
not to exceed between $3 aud 81 per
share,— not equal to rate of interest
on deposits in savings banks. The
mine bad been offered for years for
8100,000, including the Jfleming and
Ivjdev properties; and could be
hought tor that sum today. The yield
was abuut 81.10 per ton in free gold
and 3 tons of sulphurets daily, valued
at S3O to S9O per ton. The running
expenses were between §9,000 and
810,000 per month, with stoppages for
shaft repairs amounting to nearly
one-sixth of the total time. To assess
this property at 58 per cent of what
was asked for it was deemed unjust,
and not in tbe same ratio as other
raining property.
Blue Lakes Water Co.
\V. 11. Kline, tbe tax agent of tbe
California Gas and Eleotric Company,
tbe ownine corporation of tbe Stand
ard Electric and Blue Lakes Water
Company, appeared aud asked for a
reduction on the ditches of lilue Lake
system from $210,000 to 81116,000, or a
reduction of 8114,000. Tbe total
assessment of tbe propel ty of tbe two
corporations in tbis county was SiiGO,
000, or one-eigbtb of tbe total assess
ment of the county. No application
bad ever been made before for a re
duction, tie pointed out the glaring
iuconsistences in the assessment.
Ditches carrying COO inches were
assessed as much ac ditches with a
capacity of 4000 inches. Some ditches
tbat bad been out of use for years,
and practically abandoned, were
assessed tbe same as when they were
maintained as an active part of the
system. The old plant where simply
an old shed stood, was assessed for
85000. He stated that he bad gone
over the matter very carefully with
the assessor last year, ana was told
that while the list bad been made up
for that year, the assessor would see
that changes along the Hues proposed
would bo made for following year.
With tbat understanding ho allowed
tbe assessment last year to stand
without protest, but another assess
or came in, and tbe assessment of the
company's properties remained about
tbe same.
W Wildman-Maboney Alines.— W. J.
M McUee, as agent for the owner J. H.
S Spring, asked for a reduction on the
p properties of the Wildman-Maboney
m mines from 385.000 to 810,000. He
p pointed out that the properties were
i idle, with no prospect of the early
r resumption of work. They bad been
o operated by different parties during
t the last few years at a great loss.
T The properties bad been attached and
s sold, suits were pending, and liabili-
t ties of over 870,100 were owing for
l labor and material. Under these
c circumstances to assess i; the pro-
p perties at a sum tar in excess of
m mines on a working and paying basis
w was unjust.
it appears that W. J. JVlctJee had
two other applications for reduction
whicb be intended to present to tbe
hoard at 7 o'clock in tbe evening. At
tbat hour be was informed tbat it
was too lale — that the applications
ought to bave been iv by one o'clock.
Whereat McUee protested, claiming
that it was not the law. The district
attorney said the board bad adopted
such a rule. Thereupon tbe attorney
denounced tbe board, claiming tbat
ils position was unjust, and contrary
to law, tbat tbe board bad prejudged
tbe cases, and left tbe meeting.
The board took all cases under ad
visement until tbe evening session,
and then denied all applications ex
cept tbe Central Eureka, which was
reduoed $20,000, making the assess
ment on tbat property lUO.OOU instead
of 8120,000.
Narrow Escape.
Mrs Matt. Williams, who lives ou
Pitt street, bad a narrow escape from
tire on Wednesday evening. She was
preparing the evening meal, her hus
band having just got borne from bis
labors at tbe Zeila. She was cooking
with a coal oil stove, when tbe stove
exploded, tbe flames instantly setting
Bre to Mrs Williams' clothing.
Fortunately her under garments were
of woolen material, and did not blaze
rapidly. The lady bad tbe presence
of mind to walk out on tbe porch
with ber clothing afire. A heavy rug
lay on tbe porob, and she threw her
self prostrate, and rolled the rug
around tbe burning garments, tbereby
smothering tbe fire.
All tbis was tbe work of a tew
seconds, and tbe flames had not gain
ed sufficient headway to inflict much
injury to her body, merely scorching
the skin in one or two spots. Mr
Williams happened to be on hand in
tbe mebe of time aud seized the flam
ing stove, and threw it ontside,
tbereby saving the building from
destruction. Neighbors hastened to
tbe scene as quickly as they learned
of tbe explosion, and Mrs William:
after passing through tbe crisis, was
overcome witb reaction, aud bad a
tainting spell. She quickly recover
ed, and in a short time was attending
to her household aflairs the same as
usual.
Will go to Keystone Mine.
D. J. Cambie, tbe expert machinist.
who has been employed at the lathe
in the machine shop of Garbarini
Brothers for over a year, has accepted
tbe position of head machinist tor
tbe Keystone Mining Company at
Amador City. There is a small
machine sbop connected with tbe
mine, where nearly all tbe repair
work is done. Mr Cambie was over
there recently and Hxed up the hoist
aud other work 3. He expects to leave
for his. new field some time tbis
month, and will move bis family to
Amador City after a while. His
successor at tbe Gaibarini liros. sbop
bas not been selected yet.
New Telephone Line.
The farmers between Latrobe and
Plymouth started last Monday to con
struct a crude telephone line to con
nect these two towns. Some seven
farmers are in the combine. The
idea is to place the line on the fence
posts, raising tbe wire some distance
over the top of the fences. In tbis
way, a cheap but efficient line can be
maintained. Tbe line will be con
nected with tbe Sunset line at each
point.
New Butcher Business.
Tbe talk of tbe starting of a new
butcber sbop, to corral tbe Austrian
trade, bas developed into an actual
ity. Chris Coiovich, who keeps the
Austrian boaiding house between
here and Jackson Gate, took out a
butcher's license tbe latter part ot
last week. His place ot business is
witbin tbe city limits, so that be
would simply bave to take out a
license tbe same as other butchers to
entitle bim to deliver meat to custom
ers. Had be been outside the city
be would have been required a
peddler 'h license. It does not follow
tbat be will start a regular butcber
shop, however. Whether he will kill
for bis own use at tbe bnardiug
bouse, and peddle the surplus around
town, or start a full-fledged butcber
sbop remains to be seen.
Pioneer flour is the best; have no
other.
BASEBALL.
Last Sunday was a disastrous day
for Jackson in tbe baseball line. A
team from Mokelurune Hill contested
with the Jackson social and athletic
club regluar nine on tbe local dia
mond, the locals getting badly beaten
witb a score of 9to 4. A team from
Pine Grove played the South Jackson
nine on Shober's bill, defeating the
home boys by a big majority. Tbe
second team of the athletic club went
to lone and played a game with the
boys of that town, getting worsted
also. It was not Jackson's day.

Narrow-Gauge for the Kennedy.
At the Kennedy mine a preliminary
survey bas been made by W. E. Doivu.
for the construction of a narrow
gauge track from Martell's station to
the Kennedy works. It is not intend
ed for a locomotive line, but a tram
way, with mules as the motive power.
The route runs arouurl the hill to the
east of the iailioad depot, following
mainly along tbe route prooosed tor
the extension of tbe main line to
Jackson. The object is to facilitate
the transportation of all kiuds of
supplies to the big mine, When com
pleted it will probably do away witb
the pumping of oil. It is also
thought tbat *ben this communica
tion is established, the Kennedy com
pany may follow tbe oxnmple of the
Zeila, aud ship all sulphurets to the
smelters balow for treatment, thereby
doing away with tbe home chlon
nation plant. This, however, is
merely a matter of popular surmise
at present.

MINING NOTES.
Defender.— At tbis mine they are
working seven or eight men. The
mill has been running nearly a
month, and according to all reports
the rock that is being crashed is
paying well. Everything looks favor
able for a long and prosperous career
of activity.
Bunker Hill.— The statement of
tbis company for June shows that
26(51 tons of ore were crushed, tbe
mill working 27 day 9. Gold bullion
produced 511,976.07; concentrates net,
12,917.60. Total receipts for tbe
mouth were 815,411.37. Expenses,
38,655.C1; net earnings for tbe month
£6725.73. Divideud number 7 bas been
declared of three cents per share,
amounting to ?5992. Surplus in trea
sury July 1, 878,036.69. The mine
from all accounts is looking remaik
ably well, with the outlook for tbe
future very encouraging. J'he grad
ing for tbe new hoist is proceeding
satisfactorily. It is expected to have
the same in running order in Septem
ber or October. A good deal ot the
machinery is being delivered, but tbe
heavy jparts .will not be forwarded
until everything is ready to have
them placed in position.
Zoila.— Tbis mine is running 35
stamps, out of 40. The hanging up of
five stamps is owing to lack of rock,
not because, however, there is any
shortage of ore in the mine, but on
account of shortage of miners to get
out tbe quantity necessary to keep
the full milling capacity in operation.
There seems to be a scarcity of good
miners in all tbe mines hereabouts.
We have no doubt from 50 to 100
miners could find steady employment
in the mines of this vicinity.
Kennedy.— The full Dumber ot
stamps is pounding away at tbis mine
steadily. Over 300 men are employed
all told. This means that tbis
wonderful mine supports over 600
men— a fair sizod town in itself. The
property bas been turning out bullion
in liberal quantities for several
months past, and tbe outlook is
bright.
Garden bose, lawn sprinklers, lawn
mowers, rakes, hoes and spads, in
fact everything needed for lawn or
garden at V. Giovannoni & Co.
Notice.
We are requested by tbe manager 3
of tbe Kennedy Mining and Milling
Company, the Argonaut Mining Com
pany and tbe Zeila Mining Company,
to notify the publio tbat anyone
found bathing or trespassing in or
about tbe water ditches or reservoirs
on tbe several properties belonging
to said companies, will be prosecuted
according to law for committing a
nuisance.

Are You Tired, Nervous
and Sleepless?
Nervousness and sleeplessness are na«
nally duo to tho fact that the nerves are
not fed on properly nourishing blood;
they are starved nerves. Dr. Pierco's
Golden Medical Discovery makes pure,
rich blood, and thereby tho nervre* aro
properly nourished and all the organs of
the body are run as smoothly as machin
ery which runs in oil. In this way you
feel clean, strong and strenuous — you aro
toned up and invigorated, and you arts
good for a whole lot of physical or mental
work. Best of all, the strength and in
crease in vitality and health are lasting.
The trouble with most tonics and med
icines which have a large, booming sale
for a short time, is that they are largely
composed of alcohol holding the drugs in
solution. This alcohol shrinks up tho red
blood corpuscles, and In the long run
greatly injures the system. One may feel
exhilarated and better for the time being,
yet in the end weakened and with vitality
decreased. Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery contains no alcohol. Every
bottle of it bears upon its wrapper Tlie

THE SACRED CbbFISH.
Famous Emblem That Adorns the
Massachusetts Statehouse.
A codfish carved In wood haugs on
the white mahogany wall of the Massa
chusetts hall of representatives in the
statehouse in Boston. Between two
classic pillars it occupies a place of
honor, directly opposite the desk of
the presiding officer. This wooden fish
is the renowned original sacred codfish
of the Old Colony, and it has assisted
at the deliberations of the lawmakers
of Massachusetts for more than a cen
tury and a half, gathering sanctity year
by year. It Is a relic of the old build-
Ing which preceded the present state
house, and great is the dignity of this
souvenir of colonial art and industry.
The following account of its origin
is given in a Boston paper:
"Captain John Welch of Boston was
I the creator and carver of the celebrat
ed fish. He was a wood carver of re
nown for his tune and in 1747 estab
lished his business in Dock square. He
belonged to the Ancient and Honorable
Artillery company and afterward be
came its captain. He was called upon
to contribute to the decoration of the
colonial assembly hall, and as at that
period codfish was the colony's main
article of export Captain Welch con
ceived the idea of immortalizing the
king fish of the Massachusetts waters.
When completed the carving was fin
ished off and colored so as to be a fac
simile of life and was hung on the
wall of the assembly hall."
A Fool's Identity.
Some of the best known people pass
unrecognized by those to whom they
should be known. Harold Frederick
sat one night at dinner next a man
whose very silence and taciturnity
caused him the more closely covertly
to survey him. Not a word was ex
changed between the two. "Who was
that hopeless idiot that I sai next to at
dinner?" asked Frederick at the close
of the meal. "That hopeless Idiot was
Cecil Rhodes," he was answered. It
was the fact. The Colossus had been
in one of the moods in which he would
not talk, and Frederick, though he had
seeu his portrait a hundred times, had
not recognized him.— St. James' Ga
zette.
Sagacity of the Ancients.
Many quotations came from the
works of Thales, the Greek philosopher
and one of the seven wise men. It waa
he who said, "Know thyself," "Few
words are a sign of prudent judgment,"
"Search after wisdom and choose what
is most worthy," "There is nothing
more beautiful than the world," "Time
is the wisest thing, for it invents and
discovers all things." He also said
that it was the hardest thing in the
world to know oneself and the easiest
to admonish another. In his youth
Thales was urged to marry, but he
said, "It is too soon," and later in life
upon being urged again be said, "It b
too late."
THE JAPANESE.
He I* Child, Fanatic and Emotional
Savage All In One.
He is a bundle of contradictions, and,
measured by American standards, he is
a bedlamite, straight from topsy turvy
land. He may be a Chesterfield and
a cheerful liar one minute and a red
Indian the nest— a sycophant and a
welsher today and a Napoleon tomor
row.
We westerners have been taught to
regard the little Jap as an amusing
and precocious child given to obstruct
ing sidewalk traffic with his polite con
tests iv kowtowing, to suspeudiug from
the branches of the cherry tree his
dainty poems addressed to his friends
and to dawdling for hours over the cer
emonial tea, and when we see him un
der the tent flap, bowing and laughing
and playing checkers, he seems a vel
vet pawed kitten in khaki. And yet
you and I have seen him in battle a
ramping, raging tiger, greedy of Slav
bayonets and afterward dragging him
self to the field hospital, shot to rags,
uuwhimpering, a mere bull hide wrap
ped Rround a will.
We never know a character until we
have seeu it put to the test under
stress— least of all the combination of
sphinx and Janus known as the Jap
anese. So studied, the embattled brown
boy strikes me as a strange compound
of Little Lord Fauntleroy, Peter the
Hermit and Sitting Bull— child, fanatic
and emotionless savage, all Iv one.—

OLD VIOLINS.
Reasons Why Ancient Fiddle* Are Bet-
ter Than New.
Fabulous prices are sometimes paid
for old violins, and many an enthusi
astic musician would part with his
last dollar to possess. one of the mas
terpieces of Stradlvarlus or Guarneri
us or another of the famous makers of
a century or two ago.
The questioned superiority of these
old and often battered Instruments has
been variously ascribed to the peculiar
quality of the varnish used In their
construction, to the elasticity of the
wood employed and to the ripening and
Improving effects of age and long use.
Of late years, however, much cre
dence has been given the suggestion
of an eminent authority that the real
cause of the superiority of the old in
struments Is due to a peculiar warp
ing of the wood to a higher arch, a
buckling caused by the position of the
"F" holes and sound post.
It might at first thought be suppos
ed that the same effect could be pro
duced by giving an equal arching to a
new instrument, but the effect, if at
tained, Is not permanent, because with
age the arching increases until too
great a degree of rigidity is the re
sult.—Philadelphia Record.
"Plugging" a Hotel Guest.
The hotel detective stepped out of
the elevator and walked over to the
counter.
"Well, I plugged him," he said.
"Plugged him? Who? What for?
Where did you hit him?" quickly asked
a friend who was standing by.
"Didn't hit him anywhere. Just
plugged the keyhole of his door. Nev
er hear of plugging before? When we
have a guest whom we suspect is get
ting ready to leave without settling or
whose credit is exhausted and fails to
settle up, we just wait till he leaves
his room and plug the keyhole in his
door. Then he has to settle up or leave
his baggage. The plug fits over the
end of a key. It is placed in the lock
and turned. The key is then with
drawn, leaving the plug in the door."

THE AMADOH LEDGEH: JACKBOK, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. JULY Itt, 1907.
Old World
And New.
W. S. ODLIN
Copyright, IDO7, by Homer Spraguc.
"He looks as if he were one of the
statues, just a part of this wonderful
picture of the old Italy and the new
rolled into one," mused Penelope Gar
diner. "He is really more than life
size — six feet four If he is an inch."
Her aunt, Mrs. Hammell, swung
around sharply.
"Who? Oh, that guard? It is his hel
met, my dear child, aud his high heeled
boots. Wouldn't you thiuk he'd be
ashamed to pose like that at the head
of the grand staircase? Did you ever
see so much gilt braid aud shiny leath
er on one human being?"
Mrs. Hamniell's voice had executed
a gradual crescendo, and Teuelope
reached forth a protesting hand.
"Don't speak so loud, auntie, dear.
He might understand."
But the great, square shouldered fig
ure In glittering uniform stood as im
passive as the knight in the old Gobe
lin tapestry before which Mrs. Ham
mell stood enraptured, though she con
tinued to criticise the king's guard.
"That's just the difference between
our soldiery and what we see abroad.
Every one of our lads holds possibili
ties of doing big things. Foreign sol
diers are mere puppets."
Penelope replied with conviction:
"I don't agree with you. That man
has the face, the bearing, of one who
will some day do things that are worth
while. He makes me think of that tap
estry knight, setting out to fight for his
true love."
Mrs. Hammell gasped and closed her
Baedeker with a snap.
"My dear Penelope, I am amazed! If
you behave this way over the first
handsome man you see in uniform,
how will you feel by the time we have
attended a few receptions and met the
real nobility, rising young diplomats
find nil that sort of thing?"
"Thoroughly disgusted, I presume,"
said Penelope coldly, "and I hope we
shall not go to any receptions where
tiny men, with waxed mustaches and
mincing steps, will look through my
backbone to daddy's newly acquired
bank account. It is because that man
is so big, so strong and looks as if he
could move heaven and earth to
achieve for the woman he loved that I
was studying him. It Is so seldom that
I meet a man whom I could look up
to," ended Penelope, with a sigh for
her five feet eleven Inches of graceful
slenderness. "I was considering him
only as an abstract quantity, a hypo
thetical man, so to speak."
"I should hope so," was her aunt's
Indignant reply. "Why, these special
guards of the king are gathered in the
north of Italy solely for their height,
the guidebook says, and no doubt he
was found grubbing in some wretched
farm or vineyard. In New York he
would be working in the subway."
Penelope turned and started to cross
the great throne room where through
an open window the soft Italian sun
light beckoned to her. The martini
figure at the entrance so close to the
Gobelin tapestry had not moved the
half of an inch, but above the gold
braid on his collar aud rising up the
peak of his helmet was an unmistaka
ble flush.
Penelope paused, frozen in her tracks,
but the man looked straight ahead.
She crossed to the window, resting her
head wearily on her gloved hand. Her
glance traveled over the great court
yard of the palace, while Mrs. Ham
mell completed her tour of the tapestry
hung walls.
"He understood English— every word
we said. How intolerably stupid of us!
Aud auntie said he probably grubbed
on a farm! No wonder these foreign
ers think we Americans are rude. We
are so secure and snug in our igno
rance of their language that we cannot
believe they understand ours."
The sunlight waned, and Penelope
knew that out on the Appian way ten
der amethyst shadows were settling.
Why could not her aunt be satisfied
with Rome's beautiful outdoor life, its
drives and walks? Why must she
spend days and days in musty churches
and hideously garish palaces? She
looked back into the room. Lovely
shadows softened the gilt frames and
furniture, red and blues blended into
purple, and the uniformed figure right
faced abruptly. He had dared to
watch her as she stood thus at the
window! Well, It Served her right for
talking about human beings as if they
were statues or curios.
That night she wrote in her diary:
"Spent entire afternoon in the royal
palace. Tapestries remarkable, but
rather boring. Bedrooms reserved for
various royal guests reminded me of
Waldorf-Astoria. Were not permitted
to enter royal suit, of course, but
heard laughter of royal children
through folding doors, and a hurdr
gurdy playing in what must have been
the nursery. Italy is a place of disillu
sions. The natives are learning Eng
lish, the better to do you, my dear!"
Penelope Gardiner held off the plate
card at arm's length and studied it
critically.
"It's lovely. Pen — you ought to
charge more for your work. You could
get it, you know. Rich women love to
patronize girls like you" —
"Who once ate off their plates, in
stead of painting plate cards for them?
I think I will charge Mrs. Fitch half a
dollar more for each of these cards.
They were done to match her Italian
villa dining room, you know."
"What I do know," pursueJ Penel
ope's caller, "Is that you are going
with me to Archie Hunter's studio tea
this afternoon. The way you have
shut yourself off from all of us, just
because your father dropped money ia
the wrong copper mine, is inexcusable.
Pen— there are so many who loved you
in spite of your money and love you
more now because you haven't any —
won't you come?"
St. Anthony himself couldn't refuse
you, Kathie," said Penelope, pushing
aside her work. "I am going, and
what is more, I shall wear my new
spring frock, made over from one that
last year I might have given to my
maid."
Penelope could say such things with
out a touch of bitterness. She seemed
rather to glory in the fact that she was
self supporting, able to face the world
which had promised her so much and
Mien, withdrawn its hypocritical smiles.
Through the open door of Hunter's
studio came the click of teacups and a
confused murmur of well bred voices.
"Jolly glad to see you," exclaimed
Hunter., looking up Into Peneloce'ji
gray blue eyes. Sometimes he Bad
thought that if he could have looked
I down instead of up, she might have
I said "Yes," instead of "No."
"Isn't it a good crowd today? You
! see, I had something special to bring
them. You haven't met Lecca yet,
| have you? nello there, old chap! I
: want you to know Miss Gardiner. You
j wouldn't think he was an Italian, eh',
| Pen?" Hunter rattled on. "Who ever
; heard of a six foot Italian, with blond
hair at that?"
"My friend Hunter said that he
would not make of me either a lion or
yet a curio, but listen how he talks."
Some one turned ou an electric light,
and before its flash the soft shadows of
the studio disappeared. Penelope gave
a little gasp and cSowly from Leeca's
face every vestige ot color faded.
Penelope recovered first.
"Ah, there is Dorothy Kent pouring
tea. I know it will be worth drink
1 ing." And Lecca, dazed, watched the
trail of a shimmering ciel blue voile
! skirt across Hunter's priceless rugs to
4he tea table. There for several min
utes she stood with her back turned
full upon the group around her host
and his guest of honor.
She was the center of another laugh
ing group when she felt his compelling
gaze drawing her away from the chat
ter. Hunter was speaking to her in a
tone which the tense, nervous girl did
not realize was one of renunciation.
"Lecca has been unpacking some of
his traps in my farther room. He
wants to know if you would like to
see them. It's an honor, Pen. Even
I have not seen the picture he expects
to exhibit at the academy next month.
He's a fine fellow. Met him last year
in Paris. Awfully glad he has taken
■ a shiue to you."
Without speaking Penelope passed
through the door whose hangings Lee
ea drew aside for her. He crossed to
a canvas aud threw back the drapery
which hid it.
"I have named it 'The Old World and
the New,' " he said simply.
Penelope looked with widening eyes.
There was the t .\stried wall of the
throne room in an its old world color
ings, faded, in places almost obscure,
while against it, vital, full of grace
and vigor, was the figure of an alert
American girl clad in navy blue broad
cloth, a velvet picture hat ou her soft
brown hair and a great bouquet of
Roman violets at her belt.
"You see, I have done what you said
—something worth while— and, having
done it, I have come to show it to you
and your people. I wanted you to
know that you had made it possible —
it is not for sale"— He drew himself
up proudly, and she reached out her
head pleadingly.
"And if it was— l— l could not buy it.
Much has happened to me since the
day— in the throne room. We— we have
lost everything."
"Ah!" The mau drew a long, deep
breath. "Fate has indeed been kind;
otherwise I might not speak! I was
a foolish boy, unworthy son of a gifted
father, proud of my authority in the
royal guard and my toy uniform—
faugh— until you came and the man in
me cried out in shame. You said I
could do it. Have I done it well
enough to please you?"
She bowed her head and then raised
it again. Yes, without the helmet and
the high heels, he still towered above
her, aud then her eyes fell before hia
earnest gaze.
"That day— it was the same, the
glance, the flash, you will forgive me,
the message of love. In our country
love does not wait Yet for five years
I have worked for you. All lam you
have made. Today I may be artist to
our king. Win you come?"
"To my king— yes."
And, though his next words were of
his own country, the girl understood,
for the language of love is the same
in the old world and in the new.
Men as Boarder*.
A woman who has made a modest
competence by running a private ho
tel says she would rather have women
as boarders than men. Perhaps they
are a little inquisitive about one an
other's affairs, she admits, and dis
posed to find fault oftener than they
are justified in doing. On the other
hand, they usually voice their com
plaints either directly or in such a
manner that the criticisms soon reach
the landlady's ears. Men, on the con
trary, don't lodge so many open com
plaints, but they make bitter remarks
one to another, and it Is seldom their
remarks are repeated to the hostess
until too late to offset their bad effect.
This woman puts herself on record as
saying that when men are inclined to
be at all disagreeable they are much
more difficult to deal with than wo
men. One can always soothe disgrun
tled women by a little extra attention
to their comfort, she says, but the
male boarder or hotel guest who un
dertakes to criticise a place harshly la
a hopeless case.— Kansas Ctty Star.
A COINCIDENCE.
Peculiar Combination of Events Re-
lated by Andrew Lang.
As to "the long arm of coincidence,"
it may be as long as is necessary.
Nothing is impossible to coincidence.
An instance of my own experience,
said Andrew Lang, convinces me of
this fact. 1 had been reading a foolish
book, "Out of the Hurly Burly," and
some of the rhymes ran iv my head.
They began:
Bury Bartholomew out in the woods
In a beautiful hole In the ground.
Iv the afternoon I drove with a par
ty of friends, and we took the refresh
ment of tea at a house where there
were several other g;;ests, all unknown
to me even by name. As two of these
lived v.t a p!aco cv our homeward
route, they accompanied us in our ve
hicle. As we passed a wood on a hill
side ouo of these anonymous strangers
said to ire, -This is the buri;;l place of
the Hurrays of Gtendhnbreac." I ab
sently aud automatically replied:
Bury Bartholomew cut in tha v.-oods
In a beautiful hc!e In the ground.
A kln.i cf chill blight settled on the
party, though cno of them tactfully
askc-.l me what poet I was quoting.
When we hud set down our two
strangers at tbeir own home I was
askc;l whether I kuew the name of the
gentleman ou whom I had expended
my poetical quotation? Of course I did
Ddt know, and of course his surname

!n bad health, my citation had an air
}f brutal appropriateness. "Thus does
fortune banter us." for Bartholomew

A Conundrum.
[Original.]
A gentleman midway between birth '
and threescore years aud ten sat with
a girl of eighteen. He was still young
enough to be considered a companion
for a young lady, though within a few
years of the time when iv calling upon
one of them she would probably ask If
he was looking for her father or moth
er. In this case the two had been
friends for years. When the girl was a
child and he in the twenties, she had
been accustomed to climb into his lap
and hug him. She had got over that.
They were sitting in the library of the
girl's residence, she on a divan, he in
an easy chair. The windows and doors
were open, and a breeze blowing over
the garden brought in a delicious per
fume of flowers. The man was speak
ing:
"You don't remember your mother,
do you?"
"No. You know she died when I was
five. But it seems to me I know her
from her letters, many of which I have
found and have read over and over
again."
"Have yon come among her papers
upon a copy of a contract she made
with me some fifteen or sixteen years
ago?"
"No. What contract?"
"It was between your mother and
me and was to be kept secret."
"Oh," with a slight toss of her head,
"I beg your pardon."
"Some day I may show It to yon, but
that will depend upon circumstances."
"Indeed!"
A few weeks later the two were to
gether In the garden.
"You remember, I suppose," said the
man, "the contract made years ago be
tween me and your mother that I told
you about."
"And refused to say what It was."
"There are conditions under which I
may gratify your curiosity."
"Such as"
"Well, if you marry, for Instance."
"I'm sure my mother could not have
entered upon any business agreement
with you whereby you were to influ
ence me to marry any particular per
son."
"Certainly not. I would not think of
influencing you in such a matter."
"Then how can my marriage have
anything to do with it?"
"Your marriage with any particular
person doesn't pertain. I meant that
in case you were simply married I
might show you the contract."
The girl pondered awhile, then said:
"Is there any one I might marry who
would have an interest in this agree
ment?"
If he could have looked into her eyes,
he would have seen cunning. Evident
ly there was something about the sub
ject of their conversation that pro
foundly interested her. He glanced at
her Inquiringly, but her head was bent
over a flower she was plucking.
"There is one," he said, "who If you
married him would have no Interest in
the agreement."
"You speak in riddles."
A smile hovered about her lips, but
she kept her back to him, picking a
handful of flowers. When she turned
the smile was gone.
"There Is my cousin Will," she said.
"If I married him, would he have any
Interest in the agreement?"
"Not after the wedding."
"But before the wedding?'
"That would depend upon whether
he desired a wedding with you."
"Would it depend upon anything
else?" .
"Yes; upon whether you desired a
wedding with him."
"In other words, this contract would
interest him (and me) only in case we
wished to marry?"
"You have drawn a conclusion not
based on proper foundations. In other
words, you have perpetrated a fal
lacy."
"Suppose," she went on after fram
ing another question, "I should marry
you. Would you be Interested in the
contract?"
He started and cast a quick glance
at her. Was she stating a hypothetical
case for the purpose of trapping him?"
"That, I fear— l mean— you would
not be likely to marry me."
"But if I shouldV
"The contract would be of no mo
ment to me."
"I like this conundrum," she said
presently. "The solution is well con
cealed. Let me see— lf I marry you'll
tell me the answer. My marriage with
any particular person doesn't pertain.
There Is one I could marry who would
have no Interest in the agreement If
I married Will, It would only Interest
him if he wished to marry me, and
even then it would make no difference.
It I married you, you would have no
Interest in it. What is there to base a
guess on?"
"Nevertheless I wish you would
guess it"
He spoke ruefully. She cast a glance
op at him.
"Suppose I try?"
"You can't guess it."
"I can. The contract Li that— here it
is."
She pulled out a small paper that
had been tucked in her belt and hand
ed It to him. It was a betrothal be
tween her and her companion made
for her by her mother when she was a
baby.
"I thought you said you had not
found it"
"I hadn't After you told me about
it I ransacked all the old desks and
cabinets in the house."
"Well?"
"Well?"
"Do you stand by your mother's
agreement?"
She threw her arms about his neck.
