A LOT OF JERICHO ORATORY THAT
COUNTED FOR NAUGHT.
Pap Perkins, the Postmaster, Tells
'Why the Discussion ; Over Orna
menting; the Top' of the Town Hall
-. Tower. Was Abruptly Ended. ■
[Copyright, 1900, by C. B. Lewis.] ,
1 Jericho -has bin buildin a town hall
fur the last six years. It was to hey
. a tower In the middle, and there has
bin a good deal of discussion as to
: what should ■ finish off that tower.
j Some stuck fur a gilt ball, some fur a
■rooster, some fur crossbars with the
pints of the compass on -'em. . Thf
town board wanted to please the ma
jority, and a meetin was called one
night last week to j what ' the
thing should be. Nobody realized bow
Intense the feelin was till. the meetis
opened. Squar' Joslyn headed the giU
ball party, and .he got up and spoke
fur 15 minlts without stoppin to wipe
the sweat off the back of his neck.
: - He started in 250 years B. C. and come"
!• Blippin down to , now : like soft soap
gildln down the cellar stairs. He con
tended that a gilt ball on the top of a
' tower bad allus bin considered an em
, blem . of. innocence, jlt would . be . the
fust thing, a stranger would look fui
when enterin the town of Jericho. II
he saw that gilt ball, he'd put up al
tbe tavern and feel safe and go away

speakin well of the town. If he didn't
he'd set the folks down as vicious and
desperate and drive on to Tarrytown
or Dobbs Ferry. The squar" wanted
that ball as big as a pumpkin, and he
wanted real gold leaf fur gildin, and
he closed his speech with an appeal to
the people to continue to be Innoceni
and happy. Deacon Spooner was chair
man of the meetin, as usual, and when
the equar' sot down the deacon said
he'd rnasje a p^nt^EnoaJWHllams •w-a£
then called upon. He headed the fac
tion who wanted a rooster. Enos dldn'l
go as fur back as the squar*. . He has
asthma and is short of breath, and so
he started out with Columbu3 to dls
kiver America. He had bin readin up
on roosters. He couldn't find that roos
ters was an emblem of innocence, but
he didn't want no innocence on a court
house tower. The stranger would find
innocence when he come to play check
ers or trade bosses with a Jerichoian.
The rooster was an emblem of grit and
independence. He was a bird who
went to bed at sundown, got up before
sunrise and was hustlin around all day.
A,rooster on.top of that tower, would
signify that Jericho could take care of
herself and didn't bow down to' any
other town in the state. He was out
of breath and had busted a suspender
when he sot down, and: Deacon Spoon
er rapped with a cane and said:
w i "Enos has not only made a speech
g equal to anything Henry Clay ever got
■.off, rtrat 'he's'made 'a' thunderirr'big
p p'lnt in favor of .the roosterites. I was
- agin the rooster when I come here, but
I've almost changed my mind. Let us
j£ hear from Silas Bebee.'^ ,t i."' >
Silas was one who wanted the pints
of the compass put up. He was born
in Jericho when the town had but three
houses and had been turned around fur
60 years. The only way he could tell
north from south or east from west
was to make a black spot on Uncle Jim
Green's barn door, and' he never went
to the back end-of'his own cornfield
without gittin lost and hevin to whistle
to his wife. His speech was up to
dater* * He » didn't ?go v bae6*Wer 'six
months. He Bald that what had allus
, ailed Jericho and- what would allus
keep her down was the want of knowin
the compass ' pints. He '■ wasn't the
only one who was turned around. Half
' the folks in town couldn't go huckle
■ berryin without gittin lost and wander-
In around all night. Hogs and dogs
walked around in a circle because they
was confused, and every, time there
' Was "a lawsuit most of the. witnesses
.- said west fur east An emblem of in
nocence would be all right, and a roost
er would be a thing of beauty, but both
' would be beaten by compass pints. . . ■
"Silas has made a purty good speech
and a purty good pint," says the dea
con, "and I'm sorter lettin go of the
rooster and lesnlri to his side. Though.
Tve'lived In Jericho'fur 22: years, < I
can't make out ylt whether my pigpen
..■ |fj on - the' north' or -west side- 1 of - the
boose. I'm nnderstandln that Elisha
■Taylor nas-snnthhv to*spring* on"this
meetin, and we are ready to hear It." J
• * Eltoha was ready." He had bin watch-*
In the growth of the town hall fur six
long years, and he bad had his eye on
the tower day and night He had look
ed at It from the street and r from the"
roof of his barn. He had looked at It
at noonday and squinted at it at mid
night and had come to one unalterable
• conclusion—he wanted the figger "of a
gilt angel to finish'off that tower, and
he wanted that angel to" bep'lntin up
wards, same as on a gravestone he saw
In Buffalo. The angel would signify
I the goodness of Jericho, and strangers
j would no longer stop and raise a row
because they couldn't git a glass of
' beer or find anybody to take a hand at
• poker. ■ Her p'intin upward'would be
an object lesson to the Sunday sctibpl
. children, and the sight of her would
'calm the' feelln's of a man about to
lick his wife.
There was a howl of derision as Eli
sha sot down, and the deacon said that
no pint had bin made. He was a dea
con of the church and a good man, but
fce'd never consent to h'lat a, gilt angel

on top of the town hall. She might
pint upwards or downwards or any
other way, but angels didn't belong on
towers. He called upon Beverly Jones
fur his views, and Beverly jumped up
and declared himself in favor of the
American eagle; ; If a rooster signified
grit and independence,- an eagle signi
fied all that and a dozen things more.
An eagle stood fur liberty, freedom and
equal rights. It was the emblem of a
glorious republic. . Its wings sheltered
the helpless as well as the strong, and
its soft cooin lulled the Infant to sleep,
while Its scream sent the father to the
field of battle to fight fur the grandest
principles of mankind. It was a rattlln
speech, full of redhot patriotism, and
Deacon -Bpooner said that Daniel Web
ster never approached it In his palmiest
days. It didn't affect the other fac
tions, however." ■'. They stuck out fur
the 'gilt ball, . the rooster, the compass
pints and the angel, and each one de
clared he'd fight to the bitter end.
As a compromise, Jim Shorely, who
didn't care what they put up, moved
fur a gilt goat, and Abraham Scott,
who, was goin to move away and bad
[lost' all interest, moved fur a monkey,
but they was hooted down and every
body began to jam his elbows around
and call everybody else a hog. There
was every sign that the meetin would
break up in a free fight when there
comes a flash and an awful clap of
thunder, and at the same time Llsb
Billings walked in to git, out of the
storm. Deacon Spooner appealed to
him to save the honor of Jericho by
bringin about harmony, and Llsb
looked around and replied:
"As I understand It, this crowd Is
divided as to what shall ornament the
top of the city hall tower?"
"That's it!" yells everybody.
"And you've bin jawln and speechl
fyln fur. the last three hours without
settlin on anything? WaaL I don't Bee
no use,'of any more beln said.". \
"But what's your Idea, Llsh?" asks"
the deacon. .
■ "My Idea is that that fust thunderbolt
knocked your blamed old tower Into
a Continental cocked* hat, and that you
kin save your breath to pick up the
silvers fur kindlln-wood." —
And the crowd rushed out and found
that Llsh was k'rect.' •'" M-Qitad. 5 '

of the oldest copper manufacturing
firms in this city is a steel die whlcr,
has served as a paperweight for 32
years, and the coins struck off by It arc
now, for the most part, in the hands ol
collectors. This die was used for strik
ing -copper* tokens which ■ symbolized
the contest between President Andrew

Paid His Debt.
When Joe Chamberlain entered the
house of commons, he, was anxious to
try his oratorical powers.*" A certain
leading politician, who was piloting a
bill through the bouse, was approached
by one - of . Mjv Chamberlain's friends,
who said: ~,;i{ : ;. ..
. "Chamberlain would like to speak on
the bill. Can you -give him a chance?"
I "Well.; you. know, I think it would
not do. anew member, and no
body knows what the dickens be might
say."- :/±:\ ;.;,-:
iTime went on. Chamberlain gained
grounds- became a power in • parlia
ment..; The lending politician, on the
contrary, had made a series of blunders
which had imperiled his position.' An
election was imminent. Forgetting his
previous record,' he thought that if he
could fret Mr. Chamberlain to speak for
him he would strengthen his position.
He, therefore, applied to the right hon
orable gentleman.
The latter calmly surveyed him
through his eyeglass and said:
"Well, you know, I think It would
not do. 'I am a new member, and no
body knows what the dickens I might
say!"

the only person to run the business at

six hours, and there wasn't any smash

for a job to Superintendent Pltcalrn of

he, 'and you'll only have to be here

first message that night 'after vainly

The message read. 'Six suppers on 27.'
I made it read 26 and carried it to the
lunch keeper, who fairly danced with
glee at the unexpected rush. He un
doubtedly saw a Fifth avenue mansion

WEARING EYEGLASSES.
The Knack of Balancing Them Prop-
erly on tbe Nose.
A young man ; who. bad purchased a
pair of eyeglasses at j local optician's
Urn otbt-r dp.y was complaining to the
"lerk Hint he couldn't keep them on.
"Th«»y ar»-: 'i)iitini:ally falling off." he
said, "and n>-e really getting to be a
•irst clpss miisnnre. Don't yon think It
*vnu!<i help things if you tightened up
• he sprluga little?"
"No.-.. Uvvo'iidii't advise you to alter
'.he spring" replied the clerk. "It's so
•igl.'f i!ow that it Is scarring your nose.
If you'll' only be patient for a . few
'Jays. I think you'll le>>ni to wear these
glasses air right. Come In nt the end
nftlip -woek. nnd tf you are still having
'.rouble with ♦hem I'll fit you o'it with
'i pair of spectacles."
"What do you mean by 'learning to
vvnar" those r eyegla - Rses?" asked a man
•.yho happeiii-d to be standing within
earshot nft.-r the customer had walked
out. "Ir it a trick that Ins to be ac
quired by practice?"
"Certainly it Is," replied 'be clerk.
••Wpai-iug eyeglasses Is something that
lias to he learned, just like, riding a bi
cycle—ln fact, the comparison Is pretty
good, because both are simply feats of
balancing. The shape of the nose has
very little to do with It," continued the
clerk, "and Isn't worth taking Into con
skleratlon in selecting a pair of glass-,
es. But if a man has a nose like the
prow of an armored cruiser he couldn't
make eyeglasses stay there at C:st at
tempt "Until he acquired the knack of
keeping them in place by balance they
would be falling off every time he
made a sudden movement, no matter
bow tightly he Rcrewed up tbe spring.
Once'the trick' ls mastered, however,
there' Is no further trouble. People
who wear eyeglasses habitually and
who may be regarded as experts keep
the spring very loose. The glasses rest
on the bridge of the nose as liglitly as
a feather, but tliey never come off. I
once saw a nearsighted man fall down
two flights of stairs and get up with
his glasses still firmly in place. How
Is it done? Dear me. 1 don't know!

;."I owe my start In life to the fact
that an estimable o!d gentleman forgot
to put his eyi^i.isses In his pocket one
morning," said a prosperous' business
mau from a sister city. "It's rather a
curious story." he. .went on, "and I'll
jtoll ! it as briefly as possible. *.' A good
many years ago, when I was a young
fellow of 23 or thereabouts, I drifted
.Into i.iniisville in search of a job that
didn't materialize, and the upshot of it
was that I found myself practically
broke in a strange city. Up to that

money. - '

ing about with only two or three silver
dollars in my pocket, looking for a

down ' stairs room where some real

large crowd was present, and there
was an Indescribable feeling of ten
sion In the air that warned me some
thing unusual was about to happen.
"While I was standing there, only
vaguely Interested, the auctioneer, who
was quite an elderly gentleman, put
up a piece of Improved city property
and after a considerable pause receiv
ed a bid of $200. I could -see that the
. smallness of. the amount excited sur
prise, and I was also aware of a com
motion in one corner, where half a
dozen previous bidders were gathered
together in an excited group. They
seemed to be quarreling about some
thing, and meanwhile the auctioneer
was Indignantly appealing for a re
spectable offer. '■'.■':'..

this sale!' With that he suddenly
knocked down the property to me. .
' "No sooner was this done," continued
the story teller, "thau a great uproar
of protests arose from the group In the
corner. They insisted that they had
been given no chance to bid, but the
auctioneer stood firm and, calling me
to the platform, requested my name
and address and a 20 per cent cash de
posit on the $2,500.
"By that time I realized, of course,
that some extraordinary chance had
thrown a fine piece of property Into my
hands at a fraction of Its real value,
and I did some quick thinking. 'I've
sent a messenger for the money,' I said
as coolly as I could, 'and I'll have it
here in 15 minutes.'
"The auctioneer looked at the clock.
•All right,' he replied. Til give you
that limit.'
"Then I- took a desperate chance. I
pushed through the crowd, which was
already Interested Id the next sale, and
beckoned to a little fat man who had
been one of the loudest kickers a few
moments before.
" 'Look here,' I said, drawing him
aside. 'Do you want to be my silent
partner for an hour or so?*
" 'What d'you mean?' said be.
"I gave him the truth in a dozen
words. ! 'Now let me have that $500
deposit money,' I added, 'and we'll
share the profits, whatever they are.'
i "The little man looked at me shrewd
ly. This is a big joke on all of us,' he
said, grinning, 'and I guess I'll risk the
deal.'
"At the same time he counted out
$500 and put It In my hands. I raced
back to the desk with the cash, clinch
ed the sale and before noon had the
deed In my possession. Then, to make
a long story short, my silent partner
offered me $1,000 cash for my Interest,
and as $1,000 looked about as big as a
mountain at that stage of the game I
promptly accepted. That thousand, for
tunately placed, gave me the start that
has kept me going ever since.
"But what about the eyeglasses, did
you say? Why, the auctioneer, as I
afterward learned, was' very near
sighted, and on the morning to which 1
refer he had forgotten his glasses. That
was why he mistook my gesture of dis
avowal for a sign of assent and forced
me, in spite of myself, into a good
thing. I never understood the exact
true Inwardness of the deal, but the
facts in the rough were that a clique
of speculators bad formed a combine
to keep down prices, but, owing to
some misunderstanding, failed to bid
promptly on the property which I se
cured. The auctioneer was on to the
game and anxious to break it up; hence
his precipitancy In knocking down the
lot to yours truly. I heard, later on,
that my portly silent partner made $8,
000 out of the transaction, but I didn't
begrudge him the money. The $600 he
gave me on faith that morning was
worth fully 10 per cent a minute."—

COUNTY POLITICS.
■'■ 'Andrew Jackson, one of. America's most headstrong
patriots and, withal, a good old-fashioned President, as well
as a tough, unbending hickory Democrat, -enunciated" the
doctrine that "To the victor belongs the spoils."
Our county Democratic ring after steadfastly ".adhering
to this time-honored doctrine up to the^6th of 'November,
1900, came suddenly to the conclusion that this doctrine, was
not in tia'rniony with the present trend of events, and pro
ceeded to arrange matters for the incoming Republican Board
of Supervisors. But "the best laid schemes o'.mice and : men
gang aft aglee."
It is reported on .good authority that repeated efforts
were made by the Democratic "powers behind the throne" to
induce the holdover Republican member of the Board of
• Supervisors to consent to a "fix-up" of the appointive posi
tions by the outgoing Board, so as to tie the hands of the new
Board as far as these offices were concerned! In other words,
to usurp the just prerogative of the new Board and. dispense
the patronage that of right belonged to -it. The trap was
cleverly. laid and. the plans skillfully carried out until the
final throw,, when, to their utter dismay and political undo
ing, they found that no Republican would lend himself to
,- any such intrigue. The heretofore high-handed, rule or ruin
ring found itself up against the real thing, and such a humil
iating scramble for cover has seldom been witnessed, and to
this hour every leader of the besmirched party vociferously
and vehemently disclaims having anything to do with the
| disgraceful' affair.
Be that as it may, the Hospital Steward, County
Physician and at least one other officer were evidently asked
to resign, and the two former sent in their, resignations in
\ time to give the old Board a chance to accept them and fill
the vacancies ' thus occasioned, i These officials v who have
been well paid for their services by the people, would not con
tinue in office until the new Board was organized and had an
opportunity to fill vacancies after mature deliberation, and to
the best interest of taxpayers, but threw up their public trust
and demanded that their resignations be accepted and their suc
cessors be appointed at once. If they were not doing this at
the behests of the Democratic; intriguers and under great
pressure, and as part of the usurping scheme, nothing can
be judged by actions, and "actions speak louder than words.-ll
Clearly they should have remained in office until the people,
through their, chosen representatives, had a fair opportunity
to select other public servants to take their respective places,
and it is fair to presume that they would have acted the fair
and better part had they not been importuned to do otherwise.
All fair-minded men, be they Democrats or Republicans,
like fair play, and to , attempt thus to take "advantage, by
trickery, of the party which had fairly won the "battle of bal
lots/ and.been entrusted by the people with the management
of county affairs, not only merits the contempt of all good
citizens, but should and will sound ; the death-knell of the
1 Democratic ring that has so long controlled with a high hand
theaffairs "of Amador county.
The people of this county gave notice on Nov. 6th that
they had already. had all they^wanted of ring, rule, and' ; this
last piece of trickery will only serve to strengthen them in
their resolve to be rid of it forever. Gentlemen, the hand
■-■■ writing is on the wall; read it and prepare to step down and
-out gracefully when the day of righteous judgment arrives.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
• . _- ptig , : „ — -•:;:■-■ ■ - ■
["'President McKinley's message is a businesslike docu-
I ment in which foreign affairs are handled in a masterly
manner. No one can fail to admire the high statesmanship
displayed all through the Chinese and other crises.
,"•:,* The message in its discussion of financial affairs of great
importance is very strong and all that could be desired. The
Nicaragua canal matter might have been couched in rather
more emphatic terms, but the reiteration of the necessity of
ratifying the Hay-Pauncefote treaty shows plainly enough
.i that the. President is in line "with "the enterprise for we cannot
build the canal, without being guilty of gross bad faith, uptil
said treaty is ratified. :-'/
The President strongly recommends : the j laying of the
Pacific cable, and this recommendation will doubtless have
the desired effect on Congress.
k-jjy r. As a whole, the message justly takes rank with the 1
ablest documents of the kind on record.
•It is understood that later President McKinley will, in a
message, make a strong plea for the immediate con
struction of the Nicaragua canal.
DON'T GET RATTLED.
f:.?4"WJb°m the. Gods destroy they first make : mad." It
would seem that the Gods are after the Democratic managers
of Amador county. 7 For the sly and foxy manipulators of
Democratic ring politics had surely gone mad when they
planned the little game that was played with such effrontery
at the last meeting of the Board of Supervisors.
That performance will add hundreds of votes to the^ Re
publican ticket at the next election;: -Our Democratic office
holders, are hastening to say: "I had nothing to do with; it."

Paulley In Alaska.
S. M. Paulley. who was an employe
of Tom Chichizola for three years, one
year of which period he was foreman
at the sawmill, left Amador county in
1898 for the gold fields of Alaska.
When he left for the north he was
afflicted with -rheumatism, but after
experiencing a winter in Alaska where
at times the thermometer marked 76
and 82 degrees below zero, the rheu
matism left him entirely and he has
not felt a twinge of It since.
j Mr. Paulley returned here about two
weeks ago, hale and hearty and brim
full of faith in Alaska where he will re
turn next April, to continue work on
valuable claims which he owns in con
junction with Charles IL Rogers, a
brother of Lieutenant Rogers, who is
in command of the military post at
Circle City. His claims are on Harri
son Creek, about 70 miles from Circle
City, and he says most claims there
are good for frooi $12 to $16 a day per
man. One of his claims yielded 267
ounces in 71 days. All ■ work is done
by sluicing, and Mr. Paulley will take
back with him a small hydraulic ontfit
to be used in the'work. He says that
one of the best things that ever hap
pened to him was his pilgrimage to the
El Dorado of the north.
During his first year there he worked
for the government and took the cen
sus along the Yukon river. This gave
him an excellent opportunity to get
posted relative to the ; ins and outs of
the country and resulted in his acquir
ing valuable holdings.
In Circle City he met Dr. and, Mrs.
Hatch, formerly of Jackson, and the
acquaintance has continued ever since.
He says that Dr. Hatch is the contract
physician, under government, at
Rampart, Alaska, and that he is half
owner, with ex-Gov. McGraw of the
State of Washington, of very valuable
mining claims.

The Petticoat property, in the Rail
road Flat mining district, shows . large
■'■ quantities of high grade ore and every
thing is progressing in a * most ' favor
able manner.. Recently 400 tons of ore
( were ; crushed and ". yielded $90,000.
-Good mines are all around the property
and Railroad Flat has a brilliant future
in her mining interests.
* On the Sunrise, which is situated at
Railroad Flat and is - superintended by
Clyde Weatherwax, a new steam hoist
is being put up and development work
I ' about the mine is progressing satis
* factorlly. ; At the bottom of the shaft
high-grade ore has been found and the
' sinking will be continued. The Last
Chance Is working, and work will be
resumed on the Paragon also. :
i The new shaft of the Blrdena mine,
now down about seventy feet, will be
sunk deeper when the new steam hoist
is in operation, which will be in the
course of a few days. Plenty of good
ore has been found. W. W. Cook, the
promoter of the Birdena, has also
bonded the Creighton ranch property
for the Blrdena people, and will also
develop that property, which lies west
of the Birdena. ' Large deposits of ore
have been found on this property and
it promises well from the surface indi
cations. ■ ./>'
A heavy flow of water from some old
workings was unexpectedly tapped in
the shaft of the Lloyd, on Central Hill
near San Andreas, this week and drove
the force from the mine and necessi
■ tated a temporary suspension of opera
tions. The water is supposed to come
from the Old Union shaft, and the flow
iwas so great that the pumps were un
able to keep it out of the . shaft, . and
after working hard for thirty-six hours
and a steady gain of water being notice
able in the shaft, it was decided to sus
pend operations for a time and put in
pumping machinery of a mnch greater
capacity than that at present employed.
The prospects ] were of the brightest
when this unforseen state of affairs
presented itself, and it is much to be
regretted by all. However, Mr. Pal
mer, who has the mine In bond, knows
the surrounding country well and has
much faith in the Lloyd and " will soon
again go ahead in the work of develop
ment, i

800 foot levels. The mine looks better
than ever, and we hope to chronicle a
large yield at the next clean-up/ :
TUOLUMNE COUNTY
-."Mother Lode: The Draper mine,
which has long been known as a first
class property, is now undergoing im
provements to put it in . condition ' to
yield up Its riches. A large Cornish
pump has been' lnstalled, which will
handle all the water likely to. be en
countered, A ditch has been com
pleted to bring in all the water needed
to run hoist, mill and batteries. - The
mine is to be equipped with the very
latest apparatus for safe and easy work
ing and the owners, as well as the gen
eral manager, L. Lahaise, seem deter
mined to i place the property In such
condition that when once started up,
no time will be lost from accidents to
poor machinery or insufficient supplies.
The owners of the Draper are also con
trollers of the Starr King, one of the
best properties on the east bolt, and
the same liberal methods are being em
ployed In fitting the latter mine as on
the Draper. The owners are now on
the ground and have thoroughly ex
amined their properties. They are
putting in their money intelligently,
in a business like way as they would
engage in manufacturing or any other
legitimate enterprise, and they will be
rewarded. When everything is ready
for it, a mill -will be erected on the
Draper.
A boiler, pump and other machinery
Were unloaded at the depot this week
for the Golden .West mine, and were
later taken to tha mine.
A. C. Morrison is now general man
ager of the Crystalline mine near
4MnesVmn, and has appointed. Thomas,
Mickel as foreman. The property Is a
good one, and with good management,
should be a producer.
- At th.- Santa Ysebel a hoist has been
put on No. 2 shaft and connections wiil
soon be made between Nos. 1 and 2 and
hoisting will goon through both shafts.
The mine is now free from water and
active operations are to be resumed.
Hal. J. Sisty of the Spring Gulch
mine arrived in Sonora Wednesday
evening. He has been quite ill and has
not yet recovered. He . reports that
sinking has been started on the mine,
and that development work Is being
rapidly pushed.
The ledge has been struck on the
1000 foot level of the Dutch mine, the
ore being richer and "the vein wider
than above. The length of the shoot
Is not yet accurately known. A raise
has been started from the 1000 level to
meet a winze which is being sunk from
the 900 level. This will furnish venti
lation. The canvas for. the canvas
plant has arrived and the cyanide plant
may start at any time. Superintend
ent Trittenbach is much pleased with
the prospects of ( the property which,
he thinks, . are brighter than at any
time in its history .

Nugget: At the Ribbon Bock, drift
ing is being continued and is now about
200 feet south of the shaft.* The middle
ot this week the ledge came in and
shows fine ore. The operators are
highly pleased with the outlook for the
Democrat: All the miners "at the
Zentgraf mine were laid off temporarily
the past week the ditch having broken
in consequence of the heavy rains.

THE AMADOK LEDGEB: JACKSON, CALIFOHKIA, TRID AT, DECEMBEB -7, 1900.
Our Delegation In Congress.
When Congress met at noon . last
Monday, Dec. 3,' Senators Perkins and
Bard, were each recipients of large
bunches of cut flowers, while the five
members of the California delegation
in the House who had arrived, as they
sat at their desks, .were almost hidden
behind huge bouquets. \ Representa
tives Barham j and Waters had not
yet reached the capital, but were ex
pected before the. close of the week.
Messrs. Loud, Metcalf, Kahn, Need
ham and Woods were present. ■ •
At the conclusion of the roll call
Representative Woods, the member
from the Second District, was escorted
before the bar -to take the oath by
Congressman Loud, the senior member,
of the delegation. Mr. Woods desires
to obtain important legislation at the
hands of the River and Harbor Com
mittee, and he also hopes to obtain the
passage of a resolution to save the ' 'Big-
Trees. ','■'■ This resolution passed . the
last Congress, but it J was so worded
that . the , Secretary of the Interior
found it ": impossible to carry Its pro
visions into effect. , The amended reso
lution, covering the weak points of the
former measure, will be introduced at
an early day and passed through the
House by the California delegation,
and Senator Perkins will use his best
endeavors to get it through the Senate.
Representative Metcalf says that he
has at least throe projects which will
occupy his attention during the coming
session. . .
In reference to the matter, he said :
"I desire to secure' first,' an increased
appropriation for the improvement of
Oakland harbor. I purpose to secure
a good sum if possible. Another mat
ter I purpose to look into is why the
contracts are not let for the excavating
of the tidal canal. An abundance of
money has been appropriated, but for
come reason unknown to me the- con
tracts have not been let. The progress,
or rather lack of progress, upon . the
Oakland public buildings .is far ' from
satisfactory, and I intend to call upon
the Supervising Architect at once to
see if the work on this structure cannot
be hastened." /;; ;
Representative Need ham is preparing
a bill which he will introduce providing
an appropriation of $250,000 for the
erection of a public building at Fresno.

Jail Breakers.
1 Last Monday night Constable Gray of
Sutter Creek, arrested three strangers
who had by their actions aroused i the
suspicion of several citizens. The men
were locked up In the " town jail, a
wooden structure heretofore considered
secure enough for ordinary prisoners.
The - next morning, however, told a
different story. The jail had apparent
ly encountered the tail end of a Kansas
cyclone which had not only ripped one
side of it to pieces but ' demolished the
contents, Including bedstead and; other
furniture. The prisoners -■ had i also
been blown away. -At all events they
were no where to be found. It jls be
lieved that the three prisoners had ] a
confederate outside who aided them
with a crowbar to make good ' their
escape. ' ■ • '
Directors' Sleeting.
A ; meeting of the directors of the

routine j business of the meeting had
been finished, matters of interest and
importance were considered, resulting
in a determination on the part of the
Company to sink the shaft to a depth
of at least 1000 feet and perhaps deeper.
The reports from the superintendent
are very satisfactory and encouraging.

CALIFORNIA GOLD DEPOSITS
One of the Principal Dykes
Is In Amador.
BARGING WALL OF KEYSTONE FORIED BY DYKE
Branch Dykes.— Examination of Aur
iferous Dyke In Nevada
County.
Two of the principal auriferous dykes
in California are the Amador Diabase
dyke, Amador county, and the Eureka
Idaho and Maryland Diabase dykes in
Nevada county. '-.. , .
The two richest and most continuous
ly producing mines as yet met with in
California have been found in connec
tion ; with those ' two dykes. The
Eureka, Idaho and .Maryland dyke
forming . the hanging : walls of those
mines which may be classed as one and
the Amador dyke which forms the
hanging wall of the Keystone mine.
; Attached to this report is a "plan of
the great Amador quartz vein, " show
ing the position of the different claims
and the : course of the ; dyke. It was
surveyed •by ■ Mr/ J. Brown and ob
tained for the Bureau through the
kindness of the Surveyor General.
■- Macdonald, Esq., president of the
Keystone Company, kindly furnished
me with a surface plan of the Keystone
mine, showing the course and width of
the dyke and adjoining claims. .He
also gave mo plans of the different
levels which show much better than I
can describe the way in which the
auriferous quartz and pyritic matter
occurs. They are to be seen at the
Library of the Bureau.
The intrusion of dyke matter be
tween the cleavage of the slate and the
influence -of that and the planes* of
stratification or bedding upon the pro
ductiveness of the deposits is a very
interesting study.
: The course of the Amador dyke and
the strike of the cleavage of the slate
are nearly the same, running in one
given direction of the compass over
nearly the whole of the ground I have
examined. ' -" ..
■In the Library of i the Bureau will
also be found a plan of the surface lo
cation and a longitudinal section of all
the underground workings from the
Onelda to the Lincoln mine. It . was
surveyed , under my direction many
years ago, (1872), but shows the line or
zone of productiveness of the mines at
that time.
' At Quail Hill, Calaveras county, and
near; Lincoln, Placer county, where
copper ore was met with in the slate
rock, intruded small dykes are found
sometimes between the cleavage of the
slates and on the sides of these dykes a
few inches of a ferrugenous matter is
occasionally met with rich in g01d. , ; ,
The Amador dyke, like those in the
north of England and elsewhere, may
be traced for a long distance and on its
sides are found the auriferous j deposits
called the "Mother Lode." To the
west and east of the dyke is argillaceous
slate, forming the foot wall of most of
the so called lodes or veins. , ■--',* : ;
- Branch dykes occur at different
points but the rock in them has been
very much altered, as at the Zeile and
other mines. The course of such
branches continue the same as the
strike of the cleavage in the slates,
though the dip of the cleavage is not
so regular.
I have collected and roughly cut a
very large number of sections from this
dyke, but finding the rocks above the
the Keystone to be less altered than at
any other point, I selected specimens
from them, had slices made for j micro
scopical examination ' and sections cut
for microscopical determination. No.
1 plate is a photograph of one of the
slices made for microscopical 'examina
tion, and I think it shows the character
of the rock well, and will be better un
derstood by my fellow miners than any
plate from microscopic sections ■
I have selected two microscopic sec
tions of the rock- taken from the Key
stone mine, one cut exceedingly thin
and the other only sufficiently so to
show distinctly the different colors in
the rock. They are . both in the col
lection of the Bureau. '
The results of the examination of a
specimen of rock from 1,000 foot level
of the Keystone mine (which results
have been checked, or passed upon by
some of the members of the London
Geological Society of which I am a
member) are as follows :
A basic igneous rock of a dark green
ish color, specific gravity, 2.800; con
tained silicia, 44.45 per. cent. Under
the microscope the following minerals
were observed: Oligoclase, albite,
anorthite, chlorite, pyroxene (angite),
labradorite, and as accessories pyrite
and magnetite. -'■.',
The mineral is rather coarse grained
and somewhat porphyritlc as crystals
of oligoclase were observed (in the sec
tion) imbedded in* a compact matrix.
The mineral may be classified as a
diabase (somewhat porphyritic).
The Eureka, Idaho and Maryland
Diabase dyke in Nevada county is first
seen a short distance west of the
Eureka claim, it can be traced east
ward through the Eureka, Idaho and
Maryland ground. The Idaho Com
pany have from the 900 foot level
driven a crosscut south for a distance,
I believe, of some 600 feet into their 1
dyke, but what really is its width it is ,
difficult to say. It forms, however,
the hanging wall of the three claims,
these foot walls being an altered
Gabbeo called Serpentine. *"-; I
I have carefully examined microscop
ically and otherwise endless specimens
from the hanging walls at the different
levels of the Eureka and Idaho mines,
and tho' they differ greatly, yet the
results are such as to leave no doubt in
my own mind that the rock Is diabase,
so I selected three specimens, being
about as fair an average as I could col
lect and the following ia the result:
No, 1 hanging wall Idaho 1,600 foot
level, A dark green, mineral showing
under the ' microscope oligoclase^ lab
radorite (sado lime felspar), anorthito
(lime soda felspar) and chlorite. ■'; Mag
netite and pyrite with calcite were ob
served as accessories. Specific gravity
2.8 basic. The rock may, once have
been a dolerlte but it now should be
classed as a diabase. ' No. 2, hanging
wall,' Eureka mine 600 foot level. A
similar rock to No. 1, presenting a dark
green appearance under the ordinary
lens and under the microscope showing
oligoclase, labradorite, anorthite and
chlorite, magnellte, pyrite, chalcopyrite
and calcite as accessories. 'The cry
stalline forms are not as distinctly, de
veloped as in No. 1, and the rock : also
contains an access of pyrite as If it had
been obtained from near a metalliferous
deposit, and it Is not unlikely that a
careful analysis would show, the ."pres
ence of gold. Basic Sp., gravity 30.
' The rock may be called a diabase.
No. 3, hanging wall of the Eureka 400
foot level. * Dark green rock Sp., grav
ity 2.9 basic, showing under the micro
scope oligoclase, labradorite, anorthite
and chlorite. Magnetite as . accessory.
It resembles No. 2, but does not; con-'
tain so much pyrite. It may be classed
as a diabase.— Mining and Engineer

Origin of "Under tbe Rose."
In-Greek mythology the rose was the
symbol of silence, as it was said that
Cupid, the son of Venus, gave the god of
silence a golden rose as a bribe to con
real the amours of the goddess of love.
1 1 was,< therefore, sculptured •on i the
■filings of banqueting halls and placed:
is a sign above the doors of question
able resorts. | Guests at feasts-, were
'crowned with. roses to intimate jthat
:heir conversations while in their cups
were not to be repeated elsewhere^
i.The ■ phrase obtained currency; In
Greece after Pausanias, the admiral of
the Greek fleet plotted with ' Xerxes to
betray the cause of the Greeks by 'sur
rendering ' the ships, the negotiations
being conducted in a small banqueting
hall/ the' roof of which was, as usual,
covered . with , sculptured roses. ' The
plot, however, was discovered and or-
Jers given for the arrest of the traitor.
Pausanias endeavored to make bis 'ref
uge iin a temple which possessed • the
right of asylum. Unwilling to violate
the sanctity of tbe place by forcibly
removing him and still more unwilling
lo allow. him to escape,' his follow citi
zens walled up every .entrance and,
by one account left him. to die of star
vation; by another, killed him by j un

j; A, Cermnijj elector j has!b^en Investi
gating the;qliestf6n'of-beds,.and the re
sult of his labors has been lately given
to the world In the pages of a German
journal. In the first place, to convince
mankind of the Importance ofJhis sub
ject, the doctor reminds all mankind
that we spend from one-fourth to one
third of our lives In bed, after which
he proceeds to advise the world on the
healthiest kind of couch and the most
sensible manner of reposing thereon.
A' hard bed appears to be' the best,
and it is laid down that children from
the earliest years should be trained to
sleep.on these hard beds.. :iSoft beds
are too( warm and do not admit suffi
cient air. ■'■ Even Tn the case of the hard
bed the sleeper .'is warned to see that
his covering, whether woolen or cotton,
Is not so heavy that the body Id kept
overwarm and fresh air is excluded.
This "ventilation, according'to our au
thority, is all Important But I what
will middle aged people say when the
man of science bids'them . dispense
with their pillows? Pillows, he de
clares, are evils, and it Is. right that we
should sleep with limbs uncramped on
a perfectly; horizontal plane. Knowing
the weakness of human flesh, however,
the doctor declares that if pillows are
retained they should be neither too soft
nor too thick. .. ■■ • ■ .•• ■•.•'.
 A. point on which most people will
agree with this authority is the neces

A Story of Whistler.
The Boston Transcript saj's: "A di
verting anecdote is told of the boyhood
of Mr.'Whistler, the greatest' modern
impressionist He was apprenticed,to
dome engineers who were etching elab
orate maps-on copper.- :One day his
employer asked him If he also could
etch maps on copper. 'Oh, yes., j I can
etch,' promptly answered young Whis
tler.
"As a matter of fact he had' never
used an etching: needle in his life.
However, they gave j him the copper,
and he set to work, making a very fine
and beautiful map.' But "found the
edges of the plate, which when bitten
In with acid are always stopped out. he
etched some characteristic little, sketch
es of the different members of the
firm,'lncluding a very humorous one of
the chief himself. ' "' '
"Shortly after he'happened to go
away for a week or two for his holi
day. Meantime the plate j had • been
bitten" in and printed with all of the
dreadful little caricatures that he had
forgotten to stop out appearing in star
tling prominence, the sketch of; the

cause of Its great resemblance' to that

The Gold Brick Swindle.
"The gold brick swindle." said a
business man quoted;in the New. Or
leans Times-Democrat, "Is one, of the
most plausible propositions ever, ad
vanced and has .landed some of the
cleverest business men" In' the country.
A number of years ago It. used to be a
common thing for banks In the west to
buy gold bricks—l moan real' ones
and frequently there were the! best of.
reasons for keeping, the i transaction
quiet •. •.. .....;.,-.."
"It often happened that the owner of
some ' partly developed mine would
make an unexpected strike aud wish
*to buy the adjacent, property. Natu-'
rally he would want' to hold back'the
news of his discovery until he secured
the land and If he had any bullion.to
dispose of would make the sale as
quietly as possible. Tbe, banks j be
came accustomed to deals of.that kind
and were consequently pretty easy
prey for the gold brick swindler who
turned up with a precisely similar sto

A Little Mistake In Medals.
The chief officer of a Yorkshire yeo
manry regiment while congratulating
one of the troops on its appearance
made a stirring allusion to the medals
worn by some army veterans - in the
ranks! One of the men, a native of
Wharfedale. afterward went home in a
very thoughtful frame of mind, and
next morning he came on parade with
several medals on his breast.
Said the officer, "1 didn't know you
had been in the regulars." ,
"No: I ain't." said the man.
"Well, how about the medals, then,
my good fellow? They can't be yours."
The man promptly answered: "Can't
they? Aye, but they be. My old coo
won 'em all at Otley show."— Upper

ORIGIN OF THE TERM "MOB"
I'sed In Its Ffrnt Mcnnlnn In Time ol
As indicating tbe popular*, prcvor
bially fickle ni*<l easy to be moved (mo
bile, from Latin niobUHs). the exjireß
sion "the mobile people" is as old as
the' time of Cbaucei-. but In Its later
souse, that or the disorderly crowd,
and In-Its contract if 1. form, "mob." it is
not older than the postrestoration pe
riod. In Roger North's Examen. 1740,
reference Is made to the Green Ribbon
•club. MiSO-2. and the writer adds: . 1
"1; may note . that • the rabble Hrst
ohauged their title mid were called the
mob In the iisHcmliiloK of this club
first mobile vulgus. then contracted in
one syllable." it was'used hesitating
ly at first by Dryden ("Don Soliastlan."
1600). Durfy (•'('oiui'Kiinveiiltb of Wo
men." iav,Si and Sbildwell t"S<|ii!iv of

out that Dryden ' uses ' l)otb "mobile"
and "mob" lv tbe sense of rabble, the
former in tbe stage dlrectiunß as the
common word, tbe,latter as if It bad

V.lir It. I* Called Dutch O«p.
When Ben Bullet was endeavoring
to' get 'the Union gunboats up the
JainoH, he found the water in the bend
at Witch Gap too shallow to let them
pass, to say nothing of the fact thai
the Confederates had erected two 01
three batteries along the bend In ordei
to give, him a warm reception. So he
.Vv'eut ahead and cut a caual across the

has been used, and the government
now ' considers it the channel of the
river and keeps it In shape. > The plan
tations along the land were thus sud
denly drained of their, very lifeblood

The place is called Dutch Gap be
cause at this spot. In early colonial
days, a • Dutchman ■ worked , a verj
smooth game upon the unsuspecting
Indian. The Dutchman wagered the
Indian that ho could beat him paddling
a canoe around the bend. The Indian
took him up on the Instant and gave
him a mile the start. They started
just above the bend, the Indian a miW
behind, and when the Dutchman reach
ed the neck he jumped on shore, grab
bed his canoe out of the water, ran
across to the other side with It, drop
ped it into the water again and cnlmlj
awaited the arrival of the astonished
Indian, who had paddled ,t ran tlcallj
around the bend In the endeavor tt
catch up with him. What the wagei
was Is not recorded, but the Dutchman
doubtless^ got possession of 200,000 01
300,000 acres of land as a result of th«
trick.— Cor. Chicago Record. ;
