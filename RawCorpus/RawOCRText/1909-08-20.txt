The New High School Law.
Jiy nn amnndinetit pasaed by tbe
last leigaloture, the coat ot educating
blgh school pupllH attending unlou
high eobool from outside points, Id
nountina hi which there la no county
high school, la thrown upon the.
general taxpayer, instead of the
parents of such children. This
law iilloclh Aimidnr oounty. Wo
have no couuty high school horo, but
we have a union high school nt lone.
Pupils nre attending tbat school from
iliidkaiiii Hnd other points outaide of
the limits of the high achnol district.
Heretofore, the cost of tuition out-
Hido of tho allowauco by the state,
has fallen upon the parents; they nre
charged so much per mouth by tho
directors of tbo high school, enough
tn pay the cost of their tuition, after
iloducliug tbo amuunt drawn from
the state treasury. Mow this pro
ruta. by a change in tbe law, ia
chnrguable against' tho property of
the entire county. That ia tbe super
visors are required to levy a tax
euflicient lo cover thin cost, upon the
entire assessable property, including
it would aeom tho property within
tbe union high school district, 1 as
well ns that outside. Tbo county
superintendent ot Fchools is waiting
for the necessary data from tbe
authorities of lone high school ho as
to enable him to lecommend tn the
supervisors the nniuuut of tax tbat
will be necessary for this purpose.
The (ax will tie very small, as uot
more than six 01 seven pupils from
thu outside uro attending tbe high
school. Hut the tendency of this
change will be to increase tbe attend
ance from outside districts upon the
valley high school. .Not only this,
but if, will doubtless lead to a move
ment for tbo establishment of a
county high school. Property boltlere
will ague tbnt they might just as well
be taxed for a couuty high school aa
a district high school.

Will Probably Return
To Jackson.
T. K. Nurman and wife came up
from Sacramento the latter part, of
last week, on business and also for
Mrs Norman's health. It ia uot im
probable tbat Mr Norman will again
take up his residence in Jackson.
Mrs Norman is not as well pleased
with life in the capital uit££sav with
lite in Aniiidni' uounty, where she has
lived so long. On that account it is
likely the family will return per
manently to Jackson. Norman ia
here partly for the purpose of nego
tiating for the puruhiise of the 6oda
works from Podesta & (Jambo. Of
course, should ho fail to .come to
terms, bo would uot start an op
position business himself. We ex
pect to see tbo family homij numbered
again among the residents of Jaokson
in auy event, and they will be
heartily welcomed by their many
friends.

THE OUTCRY AGAINST AGGREGATE CAPITAL
It seems to be popular just now to denounce capitalists
and wealthy corporations. It is hard to account for this
villification, except on grounds that are untenable. Poli
tics probably has more to do with it than anything else — a
pandering to the masses of the voters. The socialist theory
of government is merely an appeal to the self-interest of .the
masses. It offers them, in an equal division of the accumu
lations of others — something over and above what they now
have, and therefore is popular with the unthinking classes.
But when men of conceded mental ability join in this outcry,
it is not so easy to understand the logic of their position.
Even ex-president Roosevelt, in a recent speech at a banquet
in South Africa, is reported to have warned the white popu
lation of that vast region to beware of the speculator and
associated capitalists. The conditions presented in the
Uuited States were unquestionably present in his mind
when he made that statement. But we cannot see anything
in the present or future of this nation of justify this intima.
tion — for it amounts to that — to exclude men of great wealth
from obtaining a foothold in that vast continent ! which lies
almost totally undeveloped and which probably offers greater
inducements for the investment of capital to-day than other
portions of the globe. We cannot indorse that the United
States furnish any solid ground for such discouragement of
speculation. True, the colossal fortunes that have been
■ piled up in this country within the past generation have been
accompanied by abuses. That is almost inevitable. Every
onward movement in the world's history has led to some
things not commendable. Still the general result is benefi
cial. Where, it might be asked, would the United States be
. to-day were it not^for the tremendous impulse to industry
and trade imparted by the investment iof associated capital
in the development of its resources. The abuses that have
crept in by reason of its rapid advance in wealth are not
worthy of mention by the side of the immense good that has
been accomplished thereby. It is commendable to endeavor
to correct the abuses of aggregate capital, but to condemn
speculation and enterprise generally because of incidental
abuses is not wise. This government, in the days when the
conntry West of the Mississipi was comparatively a wilder
ness, adopted a liberal policy to induce capital to start enter
prises necessary to the development of its latent resources.
And that policy proved eminently successful, even if it did
help to create millionaires. And iv spite of all this tongue
lashing of associated wealth, the progress of these United
States is as dependent today upon the big financial magnates
as at any period in the past.
The court holds that Harry X, Thaw, the slayer of Stan"
ford White, is still dangerously insane, and that it would
be unsafe to give him his liberty. He may be still subject
to such attacks of frenzy that resulted in the sacrifice of
White's life, but his testimony before the court, under the
cross-examination of Jerome — one of the keenest lawyers- in
the country — did not disclose any deficiency of mental power.
A number of specialists declared him insane, and another
set of medical men of equal prominence in their profession,
pronounced him sane. Where the doctors differ, perhaps it
was wisdom iv the court to continue the statu quo, and
keep Thaw in the Mattewau asylum. The public verdict . is
perhaps that iv being restrained of his liberty as a dangerous
lunatic Thaw is getting off light enough. However, his
wealthy family will no doubt continue the fight for his
freedom.
Some of the agriculturists are after Luther Burbank, who
ranks as a wizard in agriculture the same as Edison in
electricity. They brand him as a fakes, that ha never de
veloped the spineless cactus from the spine cactus. There
is no doubt that the newspapers have claimed for Burbauk a
great deal more thau ho ever dreamed of himself. It is no
detraction from his reputation to admit that he is not a
creator of new plants. Still by his industry and genius he
has accomplished a great deal, and his fame will eudure, in
spite of all the assaults of his detractors.

A Diplomatic
Bent
EDWARD S. SPINNEY
ICopyrlght, 1909, by American I'rcsn Asso-
ciation.)
I wns tutoring a youth of nineteen,
I had a fancy to go abroad In ihc
diplomatic corps, bat ns I hnd no In
fluence to secure mi appointment I
kept my ambition to myself. My pupil.
Alec Kirk, should hnve Iwcfi irmly for
college, hut he was not, and It was
my part to pet him ready ns soon an
possible. Ills father, after taming
him over to me, went to Europe, lie
fore leaving he gave me a single In
struction—viz:
,' "Don't let any woman snare him
while I am away."
I made n companion of Alec, and he
seemed to enjoy my society In prefer
ence to (Ji.nt of young fellows of his
own age. Ho gnve me his confidence
In everything but one. A womnn
laid siege for him, and he did not tell
mo. Ills father had lectured him be
fore going away on his susceptibility
and told him that I was empowered to
forbid his attentions to any woman.
Alee not only failed to trust the mat
ter to me, but told the womnn who was
trying to snare him of my charge. She
was smart enough to keep aloof from
me, and I did not discover her or her
object till I was Informed of both by
the housekeeper, I warned the house
keeper not to divulge the fact that I
knew of what was goiug on. If I
could save the boy I would put his
father under obligations. Mr. Kirk
had great political influence.
Alec wished the lady to win my good
opinion. She, supposing that I knew
nothing of their affair, consented,
though reluctantly.- I was introduced
to Miss Martha Colllngwood, aged
twenty-eight, impecunious, passably
good looking and of v common family.
I called on her with Alec and during
the call manifested a friendliness that
disarmed both. But while extending
the olive branch I was sharpening the
sword. I suggested that Miss Colling
wood and Alee use the tennis court at
his home and even offered If we could
find another girl to make up a set with
them myself. I had in mind Miss
Gladys Hoyle, a young lady who had
the faculty of making the most rasp-
Ing remarks with the most kindly pre
tended intentions. Knowing that there
is nothing which will turn a man from
a woman quicker than a feminine fight,
I hoped to use Miss Hoyle for the pur
pose of drawing out whatever of tem
per Miss Colllngwood might possess
and intended that Alec should witness
the scrimmage.
AYe secured Miss Hoyle, and I chose
her for my partner. Miss Collingwood
opened the gnrue, .serving to me. I
sent the ball back, and she returned
it. It dropped just within the line, but
I pronounced it foul. .'«•■.' ;<■ i
"That wasn't foul," said Miss Col
llngwood.
I looked at my partner for support.
"Certainly it was," she said.
"My eyes must have deceived me,"
said Miss Colllngwood.
"Some people can't play tennis at
all," returned Miss Hoyle, "on account
of their eyes. I thought I saw some
thing amiss with yours. It's quite
noticeable."
There was an ominous flash from
Miss Colllngwood. She made no re
ply, and the, game went on. My own
game had opened auspiciously, and
fortune continued to favor me. Miss
Hoyle in volleying close to the net
sent the ball ngaln&t Miss Colling
wood's nose. The latter dropped her
racket and caught a trickling stream
of blood In her handkerchief.
"You did that on purpose." she cried,
casting a (lashing glance at Miss
Hoyle.
"You flatter me. If I could hit a
mark like that I'd enter for a cham
pionship," replied Miss Hoyle.
Miss Collingwood was getting ready
for a rejoinder when I added to her
ruSling by asking if she would pro
ceed with the game.
"I don't think she'd better," Miss
Hoyle put in, "with that nose. It'll be
all the colors of the rainbow tomor
row. My advice is raw beef."
"Some people are offensive with
their advice," snapped the sufferer.
Pleasure had gone out of the game
for Alee. He proposed to stop playing.
Miss Colllngwood started for the house
to put cold water on her nose. Alec.
Instead of accompanying her, found
occupation In gathering the balls and
rackets. I whispered to him to take
Miss Hoyle home. She smilingly ac
cepted his invitation. As the two
walked away Miss Colllngwood turned
nnd darted a fiery spark. I taw her
home, adding fuel to the flame by tell
ing her that I thought Miss Hoyle had
sent the ball against her nose on pur
pose and was trying to catch Alec.
I supposed that I luul only made a
beginning, but I wns mistaken. When
Alec and I met again he confessed to
mo that there had been an affair be
tween him and Miss Collingwood (at
which I expressed great surprise), but
that it was ended. I kindly offered to
give him my advice as to the best
method of dropping it. The illusion
had passed out of him, and nothing
could bring it back.
When Mr. Kirk returned from Ku
rope I made no mention of his son's
o«cape, but ho learned of It and asked
to about it. I told him the story, at
the end of which lie mild:
"You Khould be In the diplomatic
corps. The first requisite of a diplo
mat is absence of conscience. Judging
from your acts in this e&ie, you don't
know the mc:mlug of tho word."
I confessed Hint I bad a hankering
S3 the diplomatic iiite, und ho promised
to see the secretary of 'ntute In my in
.treat. The result wiih nn appointment,
ar/\ harlns begun with a sinal! stroke,
I 818 now muldng bis ones.

HAMILTON buggioß.Amador County
Descriptive Article
I Amador county comprises an area of
•548 square miles. It )le» on the wes
tern slope of Sierra Novade -nountalns,
and embraces within itr territory nil
the diversity of valley, foothill, nnd
high mountainous tande.
Climate.— The climate of tho popu
lous portions of the county is as genial
and healthful as can be found anywhere
In California. As climate Is one of the
most valuable assets of this favored
state in attracting population, Amador
stands second to no county in this re
gard. It should, and no doubt will in
time, when its climatic advantages are
more thoroughly understood and ap-
preciated, become a health resort not
only for those in less favored states,
but for the residents of other parts of
'California. The temperature alone the
central portion rarely falls below 30
degrees abovo zero In winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees in tho sum
mer. Snow seldom falls in the settled
districts, and nevor remains on tho
ground for more than a few hours. Of
-course, In the high mountain regions
of eastern Amador the snowfall is very
heavy — which is characteristic of the
•entire Sierra Nevada range. The sum-
mer season is alway accompanied with
cool nljrhts; permitting of sound, re-
freshing slumber. Fogs are rare, cy
•clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
infrequent.
Gold Mining.— The county, although
rich in other sources or wealth, com
paratively untouched, is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. The
deepest gold mines in America are'lo
cated here. The Kennedy mine is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
3000 feet belowthe surfacej-wlth every
Indication that tho pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold, the county has contrib
uted fully $100,000000 to the world's
supply of the precious metal. The
mines are still yielding at the rate of
about two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth Is produced by
eight or ten mind^operating on what
is called the "mother lode," stretching
clear across the county' in a north-east
erly direction a distance , of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate between
400 and 500 stamps, and furnish era-
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
industry is still in its infancy. The
unexplored territory, • even along the
main gold belt, is far in excess of tbo
ground that has actually been worked
or prospected. The county offers to-
day one of the most inviting fields to
be found anywhere in the world for the
investment of capital in the fascinating
business of gold mining, not alone along
the mother lode, but also in the almost
untouched mineralized country ot the
east belt, some ten or twelve miles from
the main lode.
Besides gold, we have copper, de
posits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
limestone, granite, and soapstone or
talc— all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities. — The agri-
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce anything that can be
grown in the most favored sections.
In tho foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetable are raised where irrigation
U. practicable along the numerous water
courses. Furtherupln the mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2.500 feet, tho
soil is admirably adapted for apples
and potatoes. A ready market for
many times the quantity now raised of
these commodities can bo found iin tho
various mining towns.'-
Grape culture and wlnemakmg are
becoming Important industries, both
the grapes and wine commanding a
better price than the product of tho
lowland. ■
Land is cheap compared with other
California lands. Improved farms may
lie secured for one-fourth the price
current in some places. Unimproved
lands can be had from $■"> to $10 pur
acre. It does not require a fortune- to
buy a small ranch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agriculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts now devoted to
cattle ranges might bo made the homos
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amador has a populasion of leas than
12000. Throe fourths of thin Is concen
trated in a strip of throe miles abovo
mid below the mineral belt.
Jackson, tho county seat, has about
2000 inhabitants, and isan Incorporated
city ol the sixth cities. Other towns
are Suttor Crook, Amador City, Dry
town, Plymouth, Volcano, Pine Grove
mid Olota. lone City is the metropolis
of the valloy section, a thriving town
of .1000 Inhabitants.
Tlio community is law übidintr. Edu
cational facilities are excellent. A
tichoolhouse is within easy reach of
nearly every family. There la one high
school, located at lone.
Tho assessment roll for 1009 Is $5. —
HOO,7U;t, and the tax rate fur both eta to
nnd county purposes $2 on tho $100.
The Southorn l'acilio has a branch
railroad running to lone. From this
. point the lone and Ka.itern railroad ex
tends II milo-i furlhor to the mining
bcutiou.
The various religious denominations
and fraternal organizations aro wi-ll
represented.
The power plant of the Standard
Klootrio Co— one of the largeit in the
world— Islooated four miles from Jack

now to Make • Divan Comfortabi*.
Every one does not know that a
wide divan Is made more comfortable
by having at Its back two huge bnrd
pillows that will support the softer
ones. It Is usual to heap up a great
variety of these extra soft ones on n
large divan bo that any one sitting or
reclining mny arrange them according
to one's comfort. These are needed, It
Is true, but they also need a support
Tho wall Is usually too for back from
the front edge of the divan to serve.
The two large pillows made of the ma
terial which covers the divan are not
only comfortable, but artistic, They
may. be stuffed with excelsior Into
coarse muslin or ticltlng, then covered
with the chosen fabdlc. , They look
better with a heavy cord around the
edging. If the end of the divan Is
against the wall as well as Its Bide a
third pillow may be used to give an
added framework to the little pillows.
This is not an expensive trick, but If a
housewife ever tries it she will never
let the divan go without this part of
Us equipment.
riuw to Keep Air Moist In Room*.
A matron who Is fond of music an/I
owns a handsome grand piano says she
keeps it In tune much longer nnd pro
vents it from drying out with the In
tense heat of her city house by grow
ing plants In water In her drawing
room. She rnlses Chinese lilies and
hyacinths in glnss bowls and Jar* and
usually has standing on the piano or
near it a big rose Jar or a. large glass
pitcher filled with a dozen or more
vines of tradescantla growing In wa
ter. This vine la better known as the
"wandering Jew" and thrives as well
in water as In soil. It comes In the
plain green and variegated leaves and
Is a charming addition to a room, aa
well as making the air more moist
The vines root readily In water and
need comparatively little light. Abou^
once a week the plants nre carefully
removed and the jar washed and filled
with pure water. A small lump of
charcoal in the water will keep It
from getting impure.
ANY LADY can easily make from
818.00 to 925.00 per week working for
me quietly in her own home locality.
This is a bona tide otter— one which
will pay yon to investiagte. even if
you can only spare two hours per
day. No investment required.

WASHING OF CURTAINS.
Mow to Clean th« Lace V«ri«tie» at
Home and Bay« Money.
Curtains sent out to the cleaners for
hashing cost a pretty penny that can
he saved as well as not by doing them
nt home. Shake nnd brush the cur
tnlna to remove nil dust. Make a good
suds of white sonp, cold water and a
little borax. Lay the cnrtnlns In It and
let stand for several hours or over
night. If curtains blackened by a soft
coal ntmospbere are put Into wnrtn
water, ns Is sometimes advised, they
will be grimy to the ond of their dnyß,
no matter what Is done afterward to
bleach and clear them.
Change tUe cold water once or twice
during the soaking process, working
the curtains up nnd down In It nnd
squeezing between the hands to Ret
the dirt out. Now put Into clean warm
suds with ammonia or some of the
washing fluid added nnd squeeze and
sop until the curtains are clean. Never
wring curtains by hand. Simply
squeeze, which does not stretch the
mesh, or lay on a strip of cloth and
put carefully through tho wringer.
Rinse in Severn l waters to which a lit
tle borax has been added, then put
through hot. moderately thick starch.
If cream colored, add a little strong
coffee. If you have a drying frame,
and this is a great convenience, set In
the air nnd pin the curtains to It point
by point, drying two or three curtains
on the frame at the same time. If you
have no frames, lay clean sheets on
the floor of nn unused room and pin
the curtains on It square nnd true, fas
tening with a pin In each point, or If
some must be skipped do so nt regular
Intervals. It Is a good Idea to attach
In pairs, pinning the scallops of the
two curtains together.
To make starch for curtains taUe a
large clean pan with no symptom of
rust and put in it. a half cupful or more
of starch, according to the number of
curtains to be stnrched. Add cold wa
ter to mix to the consistency of thin
cream, then pour •in boiling water
from the teakettle In a thin stream,
stirring constantly to avoid lumping.
Add a« teaspoonful of fcoroseno or stir
with a sperm candle kept for this put
pose and cook until clear.
Diarrhoea Cured.

«. & Vela
C. W. Parker
S. N. Spaguoli
Ang. 19, 1909. Judges.
With ihe biggest vote ever polled
in' any "coutest In this county, tbe
Amador Ledger's 8800.00 popular
voting contest closed last mgbt at 1
p. m.
The conditions of tbe contest were
so easy tbat It proved attractive
from tbe start, and before the first
few weeks bad gone by many young
ladies were busy scouring sub
soriptions.
Nip and tuck they worked for six
weeks, each vote adding to the In
terest of tbe contest, and at no time
after tbe Urst few weeks waa it pos
sible to pick tbe winners, ho close
was tbe race.
EVERYBODY SATISFIED
Tbat tbere should be no dis
appointments, and tbat tbe etforts of
tbe willing workers should not go
unrewarded, even should tbey not
win tbe grand piize, tbe manager of
tbe contest divided tbe county into
districts, and offered prizes for tbe
most popular lady in eacb district.
This increased ' tbe . interest in tbe
oontest, and resnlted in satisfaction
foe everybody, which was tbe chief
desire of tthe Ledger.
Hlowly at tlrst the votes began to
come in, then inoieased gradually for
awhile until when i the workers got
thoroughly- warmed up, they rolled
in, in suob unmbers tbat tbe totals
soon amounted to enormous figures.
The friends of tbe candidates de
sired to see thoir favorite win, and
supported her to tbe end.
WUOLK STATE VOTED
Votes cunie from all parts of Cali
fornia, as well as from Washington,
Oregon and Utab, and with tbe
ballots came indisputable' proof tbat
tbe Amadar Ledger is tbe leading
paper in this county, for tbe ballots
meant new subscriptions to the
paper. This was one of tbe con
ditions of the oonest, and as a result
tbe paper, already with a large
circulaion, made a wonderful jump
since tbe oonesc began July 2nd.
Hundreds of subscribers, all paid
in advance for from one to ten years,
were secured thtougb this novel con
test.
AUVEKTIBINU VAL.UE
No contest in the history of Auia
dor county bas been more successful
than this one. In fairness to every
one of tbe candidates who worked
during tbe contest it oan be said that
tbey have given tbeir almost undivid
ed attention to scouring new sub
scribers and increasing the circulation
list of tbe Ledger.
For six weeks tbe Ledger contest
bas been tbe topic of conversation in
every town of tbe county.
Ibe public generally awakened to
the fact tbat tue Ledger was tbe
paper for tbeir bomea, and to-day it
bas hundreds of new subscribers who.
up to tbe time of tbe contest, bad not
reoeived tha> Ledger, but are now its
staunobest suppoters.
If there is one class of citizens
more than another interested in the
Ledger's great contest, it is tbe busi
ness men and general advertisers,
who bave watched with intereta tbe
morease in tbe score of tbe candi
dates and bave drawn their own in
ferences m» to tbe wonderful in
crease in circulation, which means
an added value of tbeir advertise
ments.
This condition cornea only as a
natural result, since tbe greater tbe
number ot readers tbe greater the
value of tbe Ledger as an advertising
medium.
Tbe inurease in the value of tbe
Ledger to tbe merchants and general
advertisers cauuot be questioned. It
was with tbis aim in view tbat the
management of tho Ledger in
augurated tbe enterprise.
A newspaper is a benefit to tbe
merchant only to the extont tbut it is
read by tbe people.
No busluess man who Jiaa watched
tbe great stiuggle for Hubusriptions
oau unw doubt that tbe Ledger bus
tbe largest circulation (if uny news

Tbo Ledger congratulates the
ladles, oue and nil, hoping they

and tbat they muy be a source of
contiuunl satisfaction.
Tbe mnnaginent also thanks tbu

THE CONTtiSi' MANAHKK
W. F. DIXON
The question bas arisen in several
instauoes concerning the management
and handling of the grand award
contest held .by the Ledger.". ,~.".V' ?
It is presumed tbat all the candi
dates wbo tried for honors in this
contest would like to know more
about tbe contest relative to its
management.
The oontest was managed 'by Mr
W. F. Dixou wbo is thoroughly ex
perienced in tbis line of newspaper
work and has made it bis business for
several years, giving it careful
thought and consideration.
Mr Dixou wbo brought to o suc
cessful close trie great 8800. OJ voting

minently identibed with tbis line of
newspaper work, and newspaper
circulation, all his lite and thorough

character bave been conducted by
him. Having made a special study

work, and during tbe past year bas
conducted a number of successful
contests in tbe following states

STAINING OLD FLOORS.
How to Make and Apply the Stalnt
With ,'.ittl« Trouble.
He Mire your floor Is clenn before the
ntnln la npplled. If there should be
pnlnt spots on It, clonn off with caustic
potnsh. nntl If there nre nny Inrge
crncks fill them with putty. You enn
buy staining of nil kinds nt tho htird
ware stores mid dilute It with turpen
tine, ns It is too thick usually. If the
floor Is to be nil walnut, do so with a
cloth or brush. If you want to make
your Ntiilu, buy a one pound can of
burnt Utnber ground In oil. Mis n
rulllclent quantity of this with bolted
linseed oil to color It without thicken
ing the nil to notice It much. Try It on
n small piece of wood till you get the
color desire*], nnd In this way you can
cnslly determine the quantity of umber
to use. It should be n rich walnut
brown. Hub this thoroughly Into your
floor till the stnln ceases to come off.
If the coloring Is not dark enough
when dry. fclve nnother coat. The flooi
now being stained, prepare for the
next day's waxing. Mix one gallon of
turpentine With one pound of beeswax
shared thin. Soak the wax all night in
the turpentine before using, then rub
on with n woolen cloth. When the
wood finally becomes well polished ap
ply wax occasionally. i
A very easy stnln Is made by putting
burnt umber In alcohol to make It the
proper consistency for easjf application
and applying as above; then give a thin
coat of shellac nnd when dry sandpa
per nicely nnd give a good flowing coat
of common varnish, which will give It
a splendid finish.
How to Care For Lamps.
So often people complain that their
lamps give poor light. Perhaps they
do not give them half the attention
they require, yet If done regularly it
takes but a short time eacb day. In
buying lamps select those In wbicb tbe
end of the burner Is elevated above
the body (or tank) of tbe lamp. Watch
your wicks closely nnd change tneni
before they become- short. Do not trim
or cut wicks— it is almost Impossible if
you do to get them straight— bnt scrape
off the charred blacfc crust with a
piece of cardboard, itnd to avoid an
odor of o" wash ami boll, the burners
every . two weeks. Clenn the' glass
chimneys ns'soon ns they begin to look
cloudy. Keep your lamps well filled
with tho best . kerosene oil obtainable
and never attempt to fill a lighted
lamp or to burn one when ft Is nearly
empty. Carrying lamps' should be of
metal nnd have firm handles, so if they
nre dropped they will not break or ex
plode. See that hnngtng.or bracket
lamps nre put up securely nnd never
allow a lighted lamp to be in a current
of air, as It will smoke if It does noth
ing worse. Ifjburning oil should get on
the floor or table smother the flames
with n woolen blanket or rng. bnt not
with cotton ' material. Cotton Ignites
very quickly and is dangerous In case,
of fire. Itemember never to throw wa
ter on burning oil. Always keep the
oil can well corked nnd away from the
range or any other heat or fire.
How to Wash Blankets.
When blankets are to be /washed
soap ' should be j cut into small pieces
and dissolved into a jelly. This should
be added to warm water, enough to
form a suds, and borax put in for sof T
tening nnd purifying purposes. Into
this the blankets should be entirely
immersed nnd -allowed to remain for
half an hour. The water should not
be allowed to get cold. After the blan
kets are soaked through they should
be soused up and down to release tbe
dirt, then put through a wringer. Aft
er this the blankets are put through a
second suds prepared In the same way
ns the first. They nre squeezed, but
not rubbed. A" board should not be
used, nnd. nbove nil. soap should never
l>e rubbed directly on the blanket. This
not only causes It to shrink, but the
small hairs nre all matted by the bo&\i,
and the blanket'loses Its fluffy appear
ance. They should be rinsed In warm
water with borax or ammonia ndded
to keep them soft and dried on a dny
of sun nnd wind.
How to Clean Velveteen Dresses.
For the benefit of those who may
wear velveteen dresses tbe method
employed to clean either light or dark
velveteen Is a very simple one. A lath
er of white soap is made. Into which
the velveteen ia dipped, then placed <>v
a board or table end scrubbed the way
of the pile with v clean nailbrush un
til nil the dirt has been removed, when
It is rinsed in clean cold water, but
not squeezed or wrung, as it would'
spoil the pile. It is dried In the air,
and sometimes the back Is drawn over
a hot iron, but this is not absolutely
necessary.
How to Save a Wet Book Cover.
Should water be spilled on tbe back
of v valuable book bound in cloth do
not attempt to dry it with n cloth or
plnce it near the beat. Instead absorb
ns much of the raolnturo as possible
with blotting paper nnd put tho book
over the back of a chnl.r or rack so
that the backs hang down. Set the
clinlr where there is n strong draft of
nlr that will dry quickly.
How Clothe* Can Have a Sweet Odor.
If bunches of wild clover blossoms
found growing in tho vacant lots In
tho city and ulong the roadside In the
country tm* picked, put into cheese
cloth bags nnd pieced in clothes closets
nnd drawers, lovers of perfume will
find that their clothes have a delicate,
sweet odor. The blossoms can be
changed each season.
How to Freshen Black Gloves.
A person who freshens her black kid
glove.ii Btiect'BHfully wuys that Hhe uues
a few drops of good black Ink In some
olive oil. Thin «he applies to tho rough
ened or worn siiots nnd places tbe
gloves In tbe kuu to dry.

How to Give Ferns Steam Baths.
Ferns may be kept fresh by giving
them n steaming of three hours. Once
every week or so they should be *put
Into the bathroom, shutting all win
dows and doors of the room to keep
In the steam. The bathtub should then
be filled wltli hot water. It will give
out n good stenm. The room should
not be cooled suddenly after this Is
done. By treating the ferns to this
bath it is not necessary to wash and
spray the leaves, which do not give
so satisfactory a result.
How to Cleanre Sponges.
Soiled sponges can be quickly fresh
ened by rubbing tlio jtitre of a lemon

INJURY TO ANKLES.
flow to Treat a Sprain by BimpU
Method* and Avoid Trouble.
If possible, ns soon as an ankle In
sprained put It under water as hot as
can be endur-il. alternating with cold
water. The enslest way to mnnnge this
Is in the tub under the hot and cold
wnter spigot.
. This treatment of ten allays tbe swell
ing and stops further trouble. It Is
well to summon the- doctor nt once In
case of a bad sprain. If he is long In
arriving, bandage wltli antiseptic blind
ages or with adhesive plaster. For the
former wrap it around) the ankle and
the middle of the foot alternately in
tbe form of an eight. Cot tbe adhesive
plaster In short strips anil interlace
them from side, to side of tbe sprain,
palling tightly to hold the- iartared parts
hi plnce.
Waking a shoe of medlcaittd clay fre
quently reduces the inflammation. This
shonld be renewed as fast ** It dries
up. . ■" . :
j Rest the foot in a horizontal posl
■ flout, or, better yet. bave it hi&her than
'the trips. When the ligaments are torn
: and the nnkle must be rested! «o ■ pil
low, much of the strain will be- relieved
6y keeping the foot beyond' tftt? edge
<»ff the pHIow. which is douhlndl *np> un
der the ankle.
Wnen a sprain is bad, necessitating
imretlon for n long time, the- a£rc«la
tton should be kept up by massaging:
frequently from the knees to> tflte an
kle; more particularly thecalfl' ot the
leg", ' Thi? massage movements should
be upward. If this Is kept up> many
tlinesr n dayfrom the time of the 1 aecl
denft r there will be no pain in wnlfcmg,
evem after weeks of disused musoft».
..There is. apt to be weakness for
months after a hard sprain. To-axofa
further trouble one should wear ai stn>
port of some kind. This may be, a
woven stocking made of rubber- or sflt
or a> Heather anklet that laces urji Ib*
front and slips over the heel.
How to Pot Plants.
New or dry pots should be sealed Id
wateir before potting plants, so> as- to
fill tbe pores, or they will abaarb
moisture from the soil and dry out the
roots. It is a good plan to protect pot
ted plants with covers or set themi in
side of n second pot to keep plants
fromi drying out. Tbe roots near- the
sides' of the pot are easily dried in
sun. or draft. Covers or double pots
shade them. Covers can be made- of
rice- matting and various other* ma
terial, or pot covers can 'be purchased
ready made. Plaut rooted cuttings ia
twoi and two and v half Inch pot» and
repot into larger sizes as the pots fill
upi . with roots. • Smnll plnnt* should
never be put into Inrge pots, but ad
vanced ns they gain size nnd strength.
If overpotted the soil becomes sod
den before the plant grows Inrgo
enough to require room. lit grows
slowly and often makes a eamplete
failure. In repotting turn the- pot over,
face down, placing the fingers across
the top to hold tbe plant, and gently
rap the edge of the pot on tli* edge of
the table or potting beuch. The plant
will slip out easily, nnd the- soots may
be' examined and plant slipped back in
the pot or potted on, as desired. If
the roots have reached the outside of
the ball und formed n network around
it the plant requires a larger pot.
How to Freshen a Shabby Gown.
The tucked net that now comes by
the yard is n wonderful time Raver to
n busy girl. She who finds In the
morning that the gown she wishes to
wear that afternoon is* hopelessly shab
by at yoke and sleeves need not Bit to
lament, but with a yard of this ready
tucked goods nnd an hour's time can
have her gown freshened up quite like
new. By using the old sleeves for a
pattern It Is surprising how quickly
new .ones can be cut and run together
by hand. This net conies with tucks
of various widths in white, cream nnd
black. Then there is net that is tucked
In groups of threes, with two or three
inches space between each group,
which is filled with colored dots em
broidered in silk. This is not only used
for yokes, but also makes up very
prettily into shirt wnlsts. No trimming
of any kind need be used on them.
They are made «C .Nsten down' the
front with either ewe bet buttons to
match the dots or with tiny rhlnestone
ones.
How to Hang Tablecloths.
Tablecloths If Jiung properly are
much easier to Iron than if they aro
hung carelessly, Tho proper way to
hang tableelotlw is to fold the hem
ends together and hang them on the
lino with pins close together. When
the cloth is taken from the lino I*
should be folded carefully, so that it
will not havo any of those great long
creases that it is sure to have If
thrown carelessly Into the basket. If
these simple precautions are taken tho
tablecloth will iron easier and will
look much better.
