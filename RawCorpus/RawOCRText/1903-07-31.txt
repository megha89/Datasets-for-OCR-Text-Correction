A Queer Legend of Tailed Hen.
When a native ' Hollander wants to
dhow his hatred for an Englishman
he simply refers to him as a "steert
man"— in other words, "the man with
a tail." The legend says that Thomas
a Becket cursed the Kentish men who
spitefully cut off the tall of his horse
while he was riding the animal
through the country, and that the en
tire generation of Kent which followed
wore tails like those of horses. John
Bale, Edward Vl.'s bishop of Ossory,
mentions the legend, but gives. some
Variations 'as "to the cause of the ig
noble punishment He says John Cap
grave and Alexander of Esseby say
eth that "for castynge fyshe tayles at
St. Augustine Dorsetshyre men had
tayles ever after that"
But Polydorus applies it to Kentish
men at Stroud, by Rochester, "for cut
tinge off Thomas Becket's horse's
tayle." One account says that only
those living in Kent at the time of
the curse were "afflicted with large,
drooping tayles, like brutes; their pos
terity being not so affected."
Decline of the Essay.
Why do we no longer flnd in these
magazines the long essays that were
the backbone of the old style period
icals? Is it because there are nowa
days no men who like to and are able
to take their pens in hand and ramble
on and on aimlessly over hill and dale,
with many a leisurely pause and occa
sional airy flights? Is it because the
editors can flnd no writers who are
surcharged with views on all sorts of
abstract subjects and could be moved
to impart those views at length to the
readers of magazines? Certainly not.
Almost every man who writes at all
would like to write essays— long es
says. But the wise editors won't have
them any more, because the people
won't read them and won't even take
magazines that get the reputation • of
harboring them. If 'an editor craves,
a small circulation in this day let him
gather the essayists about him and
freely turn them loose upon his pages.

About Mngrnets.
Magnets are frequently made In the
form of a horseshoe or letter U, but a
horseshoe magnet is really nothing
more than a bar magnet bent, As both
poles will attract iron it is apparently
twice as strong as when in the bar
form. A piece of iron laid across the
poles is attracted by both of them. In
this case the poles act on opposite ends
of the iron and do not destroy each
ether'g effects, for each pole magnetizes
the portion of the }ron opposite it The
iron therefore becomes ' a strpng mag?
net with its north pole touching the
6puth pole of the horseshoe magnet and
Its south pole touching the north pole.
This is popularly called a "keeper," be
cause .it ."keeps," or preserves, the
strength of the . magnet, which be
comes much weaker when the keeper
is left off.^t. Nicholas.
The Mattress.
Some one has been hunting up the
history of the mattress. ■ Its beginning
was the collection of rags, husks or.
rreris which were bound together and
thrown down anywhere to form a rest-
Ing place for the hinds and serfs of the
rich. It is suggested that their names
of shakedown and makeshift were de
rived originally from the Arabic
word "matrah." In the middle ages
featheF beds found favor with the
wealthy and the mattress was not ose.4
by them. Inventories of estates owned
by the American colonists show that
mattresses were then worth $200 each,
being made of hair. In England mat
tresses of rabbits' fur were once used
and ■ vegetable fibers of various kinds
have served their turn.
False Hair In Elizabeth's Time.
Queen Elizabeth had eighty wigs in
her collection, and her i cousin, Mary,
queen of Scots, had ''as many as a hun
dred," and among the incongruous
presents made her while confined a
prisoner in gloomy Lochleven, previous
to her being beheaded, wigs were nu
merous. Gentlemen who particularly
wished to please their lady friends pre
sented them with wigs of the latest
ebade of hair and newest style of
colffuiing. Fancy a gentleman of to
day presenting his sweetheart the last
idea in back hair!
Bamboo opals are peculiar gems
which are sometimes found in. the
Btem of the bamboo. This gem Is very
rare from the fact that not one In a
thousand bamboo stems contains It
These vegetable growths are called
tobacur by the Filipinos. Some ot
them are so slml!ar«-that Is, they ex
hibit so perfectly the characteristics of
the opal— that even experts frequently
fall to distinguish them from the real
gem. . "-sr ;

Sources of Color.
An interesting enumeration has been"
published in a technical journal of the
sources of color. From this it. appears
that the cochineal insects furnish the
gorgeous carmine, crimson, scarlet car
mine and purple lakes; the cuttlefish
gives sepia— that is, the inky fluid
which the fish discharges in order to
render the water opaque when attack
ed; the Indian yellow comes from the
camel, ivory chips produce the ivory
black and boneb'nek, tbe exquisite
Prussian blue comes from fusing horse
hoofs and other refuse animal matter
tcith impure potassium carbonate, va
rious lakes are derived from roots,
barks and gums; blue black comes
from the charcoal.o f the vine stock,
turkey red is made from the madaer
plant.-JH'hich grows in Hindustan; the
yellow sap of a Siamese tree produces
gamboge, raw sienna is tbe natural
earth from the neighborhood of Siena,
Italy; raw umber is an earth found
near Umbrla, India ink is made from
burned camphor, mastic is made frost'
the gum of the mastic tree, which
grows in the Grecian archipelago;
bister is the soot of wood ashes; very
little real # ultramarine, obtained from
the precious lapis lazuli, is found in the
market;^
Cutting Off the \r«? For Puntfihmeii*
Rameses 11. of Egypt cut off the
nose of any person convicted of treason
or arson. Actisanes, another Egyptian
ruler, punished robbers in the same
way. After each nose had been ampu
tated back even with tbe "bridge" the
culprit was sent to a colony of noseless
felons, the place of banishment being
known as Rhinoeonum, from the na
ture of the punishment its colonists
had undergone.
"In England In 1671 Lord Coventry,
then "great keeper of the British seal,"
had his nose cut off by order of the
king because he had dared to ask some
Questiqns about an actress then play
ing at Drury L,ane theater.
A conscript who protested openly
that he had been enrolled in the army
of. Frederick the Great in a fraud
ulent manner had his nose amputated
by order of that sovereign, who spoke
of the punishment as an "indelible
mark on the front side of the face."
The Impossible.
The Duke of Wellington wanted a
certain piece of work done and In
structed an officer of the Royal engi
neers to do it.' After examination the
officer informed the duke that it ws>s
impossible.
The duke sent for another officer, a
much younger man and attached to an
other division of the army. This ofii
cer did what the duke required.'
The next morning there appeared in
the "orders of the day" the following
epigrammatic note: "He who in war
fails to do what he undertakes may al
ways plead accident, which invariably
attends military affairs; but he who de
clares a thing to be Impossible which
Is subsequently accomplished registers
his own incapacity.". -_..-. yj :*'J± :'■._: .■
Host Expensive Tree In the World.
Probably the most expensive tree in
the world is in the City of London, on
the corner of Cheapslde and Wood
street, about midway between the
Bank of England and St. Paul's. It
is an enormous oak, and is said to be
100 years old. It is protected by a
clause in the deed of the property
which forbids destruction of tree or
branches. Architects were compelled
to plan a rather peculiar building to
avoid the branches. There it stands
in the corner of one of the busiest
streets in London, occupying ground of
enormous value — and positively the
only tree in the City of London out
side of the parks..
Wrong Foot Out of Bed.
About half the world puts the wrong
foot out of bed in the morning. But
which is the wrong foot? It is a su
perstition as old as the hills that if the
left foot touches tbe floor first you will
have bad luck that day. Probably mul
titudes of men avoid this by- sleeping
en the right side of the bed, so that in
rising the right foot naturally comes
first In contact with the floor. It is
said to be a fact that most people lie ou
their right side because of the preva
lent notion that the heart has freer ac
tion.—New York Press.
When Romans Kissed.
Bowena, the beautiful daughter of
the Saxon Henglst, is credited with
having introduced kissing into the
British islands. The Romans had a
really delightful word for a kiss—oscu
lum, /which came from os, the mouth,
and meant a little mouth, a sweet
mouth. "Give me a sweet little mouth"
would be the phrase used when a good
little Roman boy asked his mother for
a kiss.
When Silence
Was a, Virtue
NELLIE CRAVEY GILLMORE
Cop, rtghi, ItKH. by T. C. McClure
Margaret Kelton folded the. Times
mechanically and laid it on the table
beside her. For some time she sat in
fecp thought. Then she reopened the
paper and studied the paragraph more
closely, with a vague hope that she
had made some mistake. But hardly.
She read: '- *
"Mr. Richard Kent Kelton, formerly
popular in this city in business and so
cial circles, now a resident of Phila
lielpiiia, is spending the cold months in
Florida for the benefit of his wife's
wifalth.". .. i - . .. . . :. ;
-The problem of her life confronted
her, or, rather, the scruple. Bhe had
never been greatly In love "with the
man, nor yet especially antipathetic
toward him. Hence it was no easy
thing to do what she was forced to
contemplate. But there was the other
woman. Palpably the finger of duty
pointed but one way.
Two days were required to put her
affairs into shape and to prepare for
the journey south.
There was no difllculty about the
exact location. She had often been
there in the past— with him, before the
separation five years ago, he to live'
his life, she her own. There was never
the semblance of a quarrel. She could
almost have wished there had been—
anything, all things, but what was.
Margaret found herself overwhelmed
by a tumult of emotions as she sat
in the familiar old fashioned parlor
where so many of her old days had
tjeen spent. There was very little
change beyond the few trifling effects
wrought by the touch of a new Individ
uality.
It was a . quaint, picturesque old
home, a typical architectural relic of
the antebellum south. A smooth box
hedge, green the year round, bordered
a magnificent flower garden. . Outside
were wild oranges, great rows of thenj,
Whose dainty waxen blossoms of this
season mingled with the glistening gold
fruit of the last. Dotted about the
wide Bermuda lawn were roses, pink

MIKUTEB," SHB SAID.
and white and red and yellow bloomed,
filling the air with midwinter fra
grance.
A half hour passed, and, Impatient
of waiting, Margaret rose and walked
over to one of the windows.
There was a tiny artificial pond just
below, with ducks skimming over Its
rippleless surface. Weeping willows
trailed their graceful branches along
the edges where daisies and white vio
lets sprang up in profusion.
Presently a child with long yellow
curls toddled down to the rim of the
bank and dabbled his fingers in the
water. The nurse followed close be
hind, laughing and protesting and try
ing to beguile her young charge away
with a fat, stuffed elephant
The woman turned soul sick at the
sight. Here dawned another and a
tragic aspect, all unsuspected.
The boy turned an eager, flushed face
and held out both hands, dripping with
crystal drops.
It was the face of Richard Kelton In
miniature.
"Baby! Baby!"
Margaret started at the sound of a
sweet, weak voice almost at her elbow
and, turning, stood face to face with a
very young and very delicate looking
woman. But for the deep circles under
the blue eyes and the lines of pain
carved about a sensitive mouth it was
the face of a child.
"Oh, I beg your pardon," 6he began,
with an apologetic smile. "You are
waiting to see my husband on busi
ness, 1 believe?"
Margaret nodded.
"I completely forgot," the other went
on, with a pretty air of explanation.
"I was looking for my boy. I always
am when I'm able to be about"
She paused out of sheer weaknesp
and sank into a chair.
Margaret made some trivial response
and slipped back into her own seat
struggling to regain her poise.
What should she do? What could
ahe do? She could never deal the worse
than deathblow to that poor little girl
mother, upon whom death Itself had

already printed its seal. "Right or noi
right, ehe must get away.
With a swift assumption of urgency
she drew her watch from her belt and
started to her feet. "I really must not
wait longer," she said hurriedly. "My
train will leave in twenty minutes."
"I'm very sorry," the other said re
gretfully. "It's too bad of Richard to
have caused you all this annoyance, al
though of course It was unintentional
on his part. It's nothing very Impor
tant, I hope?"
"Oh, nothing," replied Margaret, with
a fleeting smile. -: V '
"And your name— you wish to leav«
your card, do you not?" ? ','■ : ■
"I have no card with me. Nevei
mind about the name. It really doesn't
matter. Thank you, and— good morn
ing."
She passed quickly down the steep
flight of steps and on down the grave]
path, her head bent
At the gate she glanced up— into the
eyes of Richard Kelton.
"Margaret— you— you! For Mercy's
sake!".
She regarded him silently, scornfully.
"I thought you were dead," the man
said doggedly.
"Excuse me, but you thought no such
thing," she retorted quietly.
"Well, and what are you going >to
do about it?" he asked with suddenly
white lips. .■'.:'
Margaret Kelton looked at him with
the contempt she could not conceal.
"I came," she returned In a low
voice, "to save a woman from a man's
villainy. It was the hardest undertak
ing of my life, but I felt that I could
not be a party to crime by my si
lence"—
'•'You !" he broke in. "You have ruined
me, wrecked my home, my wife's hap
piness, stolen the name from my inno
cent baby!"
"Come, this is no time for heroics.
Listen to me. I have done none of
these things of which you accuse me,
though God knows you are not the one
who ought to be spared. I have seen
your 'wife,' your 'Innocent baby,' and
for them, for then* sake, I have kept
silent" - -
He stared at her curiously, disbe
lievingly. "Then why did you not think
of these things before and stay away?"
"Why? I will tell you- Had I found
your— your wife, as I expected, how
ever happy, however Innocent, I must
have told the truth. She would have
thanked me; not then, perhaps, but
afterward. As it Is, I see only a young
girl, dying, and her child— a man—per
haps a real, a great man of the future.
For his sake, I want you to remember
that"' - •'.-
The man had bowed his head. At
length he looked up with strangely dim
eyes,
"Thank you," he said simply; "you
have shown me what true nobility is.
I— l shall try to deserve it."
Margaret had passed noiselessly
through the open gate, and the rows of
clustering oranges hid her from view.
John Wesley's Quarrel.
John Wesley once had a disagree
ment with Joseph Bradford, his travel
ing companion of many years,- and
they agreed to part. They retired for
the night, each firm In his determina
tion and each doubtless deploring in
his heart the separation soon to follow
between two friends who had been so
devoted and mutually helpful. In the
morning Wesley asked Bradford if he
had considered during the night their
agreement to part
"Yes, sir," said Bradford.
"And must we part?" inquired Wes
ley.
"Please yourself, sir," said Bradford
grimly,
"But will you not ask my' pardon?"
demanded Wesley.
"No, sir."
"You won't?"
"No, sir,"
(! In that case," said Wesley gently,
"I must ask yours."
It was not the ending which Brad
ford anticipated, j A moment he hesi
tated, and then, breaking into tears,
he followed Wesley's example and for
gave and was forgiven.— Youth's Com
panion.
Japan's Hairy Alnon.
A. traveler In Japan thus describes
the hairy Amos of that country: "The
men are about the middle height, broad
chested, broad shouldered, thick set,
very strongly built, the arms and legs
short, thick and muscular, the hands
and feet large. The bodies, and espe
cially the limbs, of many are covered
with short, bristly hair. I hare seen
two boys whose backs are covered with
tar as fine and soft as that of a cat.
We were ferried over a river by an
Aino completely covered with hair,
which on his shoulders was wavy like
that of a retriever and rendered cloth-
Ids quite needless either for covering
or for warmth. A wavy black beard
rippled nearly to his waist over his
furry chest, and with his black locks
hanging in masses over his shoulders
he would have looked a thorough sav
age had It not been for the exceeding
sweetness of his smile and eyes."

INVISIBLE LIGHT.
Only When II Strikes tbe Retina of
the Eye Can It Be Seen.
What is the simplest demonstration
ef the fact that light is invisible?
The blackness of a midnight sky
demonstrates this fact most readily.
We may see the planets of the moon
brilliantly illuminated by the sun's
rays, but the surrounding space is
dark, although we know ' that light
must be passing tbere. :
The passage of . a beam of light
through a darkened room is only visi :
.ble on the dust in the air, and the cone
of light seen when the sun shines
through a small hole in a shutter is
not visible, but only light reflected
from the motes in the beam. This can
be easily and simply demonstrated by
placing in the beam a glass vessel
from which the dust has been carefully
removed. The beam then may be seen
before and after entering the vessel,
but is invisible within. A Bunsen
burner or a redhot poker held so as to
destroy the motes will also render the
beam invisible at that spot.
Light is only visible when it strikes
on the retina of the eye, and it can
only do so when It reaches it In a di
rect line or is turned by a reflection or
refraction into a direct line. Just as
the bullets from a gun do a man no
harm unless aimed or turned in their
course toward his body, so light is
without effect unless it is aimed or
turned toward the retina.— Pearson's
Weekly.

HOW THEY HELP OUT.
I All the newspapers in the county,
excepting the Ledger, approves pt
Judge Rust's decision in favor of the
justices and constables. That grouchy
old organ opposes anything and every
thing which ten in any way add a
nickel or two to its taxes. Get in and
be cheerful* and help to make your
neighbor happy. You cannot take
your dirty old dollars with you into
the land where green livers are un
known. Help out! — Echo.
We cheerfully republish the above
as tending to show what a healthy
kind of a man, morally and mentally
speaking, is running the intellectual
love feast in the Athens of the foot
hills. The Echo is only in its elemen t
when it deliberately falsifies, for the
inherent love of falsification. The
Ledger has neither approved nor
disapproved of Judge Rust's decision.
And just now it is actually advocat
ing, while our cotemporaries are op
posing, an addition of a few nickels
to the taxes, by urging an appeal of
the justice salary case to the supreme
court for final adjudication. We
are not in favor of stopping at half
way treasures to please anybody. It
would be a very interesting inquiry
to find out how it came about that
all the newspapers in the county
except the Ledger, are so hysteri
cally alarmed lest the matter be
carried to the higher court. As for
the implied personal flings at the
editor of the Ledger contained in
the above, we are not concerned in
the least. It is enough to know that
they are evidently a source of pure
delight to .the writer on the princi
ple that "little things please little
minds." We are not sufficiently
versed in physiology to tell whether
his liver is yellow, green or white;
whether his brain is dislocated or
mislocated; whether his noble
personality is indicative of the
nobility of soul therein. These
things are of no importance to us,
nor to our readers. We are pleased
to admit, however, that the Ledger
represents the taxpayers of Amador
county, rather than the taxeaters,
and therein lies the difference be
tween this paper and its cotem
poraries. We prefer to use our in
fluence to endeavor to ameliorate
the conditions in a tax-burdened
community, not to hail as a step in
the right direction every scheme
that comes aloug to add additional
burdens to an already oppressed
people. The non-taxpaying class
cannot be expected to appreciate at
its true value, the oftimes uphill
task experienced by property-holders
in meeting the exactions of the gov
ernment. Some are actually com
pelled to lay by a certain sum every
month so to be in a position to pay
their taxes as they become due.
Any increase of the burden to the
extent of a few dollars means a seri
ous augmentation of the difficulty.
And our frugal, honest, industrious
citizens of this class are treated
editorially with disdainful flippancy
as evinced in the above clipping.
What does the newspaper trinity
know or care about such matters.
We have taken the trouble to look
over the assessment roll of the cvr r
rent year to find out the standing of
the editorial fraternity thereon,
thinking perhaps it might afford an
explanation of this don't-care policy.
We find that the sum total of their
taxable property is $1965. This is
distributed as follows: The lone
editor $50 realty, personalty $565;
total $615; our Jackson cotemporary
$1300; all in personal property; our
Sutter Creek editor, who figures on
the minutes of the supervisors as
the beneficiare of their patronage,
does not figure on the assessment
roll at all. The editor of the Led
ger is called upon to contribute over
eleven times as much toward carry
ing on the expenses of the county
as all his cotemporaries combined.
That accounts for the milk in the
cocoanut. '" Help out!" is the cry of
the combine, with acts to correspond
therewith. People would be apt to
think more favorably of their efforts
if they would help the in-flow as well
as the out-flow of the public treas
ury.
Democracy is in bad shape. It is
I very doubtful whether the party can
pull itself together to make a re
spectable showing in the national
contest next year. Between look
, ing for a candidate and trying; to
bead-off candidates that are hunting
I a nomination, they are kept pretty
busy. Hearst wants it badly; the
party don't seem to hanker after
him to any great extent. They fear
he would hoodoo them. The Bryan
ites are out for the scalps of the
Clevelanders, who are dubbed party
• wreckers. The Clevelands think
the Bryan crowd are the smashers.
In this state of demoralization they
are looking around for outside help.
They are coquetting with the labor
.organizations. With the labor
strength thrown into their side of
the political balance they imagine
they, would have some chance to win.
Whether such an unseemly alliance
can be brought about is doubtful.
Anyhow democracy is in distress.
The jail delivery at Folsom state
prison last Monday, in which eleven
long-term and desperate convicts
made good their escape, taking with
them a number of officials as protec
tion against attack, shows a very
lax and defective state of affairs in
the management of that institution.
One guard lost his life, and two
others were severely, perhaps mor
tally wounded in the outbreak. The
circumstances call for a thorough
investigation. -Something must be
loose, when a band of eleven . con
victs are found together armed with
weapons of their own fashioning, and
their guards are caught at the same
time unharmed and • defenseless. It
would also seem very strange that
so many prisoners could, under the
regulations of tbe prison, drop out
from the line as the men were pass
ing to their work, without arousing
suspicion. This stepping from the
ranks is explained that it was cus
tomary for those against whom com
plaints had been made, to stop at
the captain's office, where the
charges \ were investigated. This
custom made this unparalleled jail
break not only possible, but easy of
accomplishment. Due regard for
safety ought to suggest to the ordi
nary mind that any stepping aside
from the ranks in a file of convicts
on the march, should have no other
meaning than a revolt. But at Fol
som it was an everyday occurrence,
A thing so common that it was pass
ed unnoticed. Fortunately tbe
eleven escapes did not^ realize how
completely they had captured the
prison and their guards, otherwise
they might have turned loose the
whole outfit of several hundred
prisoners kept at Folsom. The ab
sence of a wall around the prison is
a poor excuse for this escape. A
wall might help to ward off such an
outbreak, but the fact remains that
it ought not to have been possible
even in the absence of a wall. The
convicts kept together until they
had exchanged their prison garb
and secured provisions and supplies,
and then disbanded. Most of them
will doubtless be either killed or
captured; the chances are that some
of them will never be retaken. It
is matter of common talk that
politics have too much to do with
our penal institutions, and this
calamity tends to strengthen that
view.

P. Dwyer vs. R. Anderson, Bank of
Amador county, et al — Suit to recover
the sum of $1000, and interest at six
per cent on a promissory note given by
defendant March 31, 1900. The com
plaint alleges that for the purpose of
securing the payment of said note, the
defendant executed a certain chattel
mortgage covering the furniture, bar
fixtures and furniture, kitchen utensils,
etc., contained in tbe Globe hotel, of
which the defendant was the lessee.
No part of the principal has been paid,
but interest amounting to $151.16 has
been paid thereon, leaving interest
amounting to $47.50 still unpaid. In
addition to the above cause of action
another and separate cause of action is
set up that defendant is indebted to
plaintiff in the sum of $253 for rent of
Globe hotel. The bank and other de
fendants, whose names are unknown,
assert some claim upon the property,
flither as purchaser, mortgagee, judg
ment, creditor or otherwise, which
interest is said to be subsequent to and
subject to the plaintiff's lien. Judg
ment is asked for the amount due, and
for foreclose and sale of the chattels
described in mortgage. R. C. Bole,

There is more catarrh in this section
of the country than all other diseases
put together, and until the last few
years was supposed to be incurable.
For a great many years doctors pro
nounced it a local disease, and prescrib
ed locai remedies, and by constantly
failing to cure with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable. Science has
proven catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti
tutional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
Cure, manufactured by F. J. Cheney
& Co., Toledo, Ohio, is the only consti
tutional cure on the market. It is taken
internally in doses from 10 drops to a
teaspoonful. It acts directly on the
blood and muscous surfaces of the sys
tem. They offer one hundred dollars
for any case it fails to cure. Send for
circulars and testimonials.

Enrico Ginocchio, after a long battle
with surTering and disease, died Sunday
night at about 11 o'clock. The last
enemy came to him clothed in garb of
friendship, as it does in fact to all
whose vital forces are slowly under-
mined by the inroads of physical de
cay. For several years he had been a
sufferer from paralysis, the malady
finally involving the power of speech
as well as motion. Until the last few
weeks he was accustomed to take an
outing almost daily in his buggy, of
course in charge of a relative, for
exercise and fresh air, whenever the
weather would permit. To all who
s.aw him, it was evident that his hold
on life was gradually loosening, and
that the figure which has been so
prominently identified with the social
and business life of Jackson for the
past 40 years, was soon to pass from
earthly view forever. Medical skill,
both local and in the city, was called to
his aid, and no doubt helped to pro
long his days, and also aided ma
terially in smoothing his pathway
to the grave. The end was not un
expected to his relatives, and we might
add was not unwelcome to the afflicted
one.
Deceased was born in Italy on March
14, 1838. When only sixteen years of
age he left his native land with the in
tention of carving out his own path in
the world. In 1853 he sailed for Cali
fornia, and first settled at Bear river in
Mariposa county, where he took up a
placer claim. Not having arrived at
the age of full manhood, he was then
allowed by the local customs of the
miners only one-half claim. He con
tinued working in that county until
1857, with varying fortune. When the

was attracted thither, and this venture
proved disastrous, and he returned to
California. About 1860 he came to
Amador county, and purchased an
interest in the firm of Bruno and
Curotto. Thereafter he became the
sole proprietor, at the same location
where the business has ever since been
conducted. In 1806 he sent for his
brother Alphonse, and the firm of
Ginocchio Brothers was formed, and
has continued uninterruptedly until
dissolved by the decree of death. For
40 years the deceased and the firm of
which he was the head, has enjoyed a
reputation for uprightness, business
sagacity, and liberal dealings, which
has made the house known and respect
ed in commercial circles throughout
the state. Iv l&T) he was united in
marriage to Mrs. Julia Baggjo. Five
children were born tp them, ppe son
and four daughters. The son Joseph
died in 1899 at the age of 10 years.
This bereavement was keenly felt by
the grief-stricken parents, the father's
health beginning to decline soon there
after. The four daughters. Rosa,
(wife pf Frank Podesta), Lena, (Mrs.
Frank Burg-jni, Henrietta, (M rs . Fred
Entity) and Julia, and also, the devoted
wife who so tenderly nursed him
through the days of his helplessness,
remain to deplore his death.
The funeral took place Wednesday
morning, and was one of the largest at
tended ever se^q fjfire. Not only in
Jackson was the news al tba pi^nser
merchant's death received in sadness,
but from all parts of this and Calaveras
county, as well as San Francisco and
other distant cities, came many friends
to pay the last act of respect to the

LOCAL MINING NEWS
Notes From Amador County Mines.
Lincoln Closes Down— Fremont
Mill Hearing Completion.
MOORE.— Captain Nevills, while in
Jackson the other day, stated that all
arrangements for the starting of work
on this property had been completed.
Timbers necessary for the repair of 500
feet of shaft were ready in Stockton,
and could be shipped to the mine in a
few days. The money necessary to ex
plore the property was also on hand,
and the owners were anxious to pro
ceed to work, and find out the gold
bearing quality of the lode in that
locality. The uncertainty of the labor
situation was the only drawback. If a
guarantee could be given that the de
velopment of the mine would not be
marred by interference of organized
labor, he was ready to give order to
start at once. , As things stand at
present, he did not feel justified in
starting up. The truth is, the labor
union of Jackson is now under con
servative management. It ia, we be
lieve, doing its utmost to allay the feel
ing of uncertainty and lack of con
fidence in financial circles, the outcome
of the late strike. There may be a few
extremists, as there always are. and
perhaps always will be, in such bodies,
but the right spirit is in control. The
focus of discontent is shifted from Jack
son, and the agitation elsewhere is hav
ing its effect on the mining industry
throughout the county.
Grand Prize.— G. A. Andrews, who
accompanied a shipment of one car
load of ore from this mine to the re
duction works ia the city, has return
ed. It is reported that the ore went
$90 per ton, and the shipment, em
braced 13 tons. Work at the mine is
being pushed ahead. The shaft below
the tunnel level is being sunk in the
ore body. It is now 80 feet below the
tunnel, and the intention is to follow it
down to 100 feet. The ore body holds
out well, and every indication tends to
confirm the Gpimoa' that jit will con
tinue to a considerably greater depth.
Horn. — At this mine, near the De
fender, work is at a standstill at
present. The face of the tunnel shows
a ledge of com] looking quartz about
two feet thick, with a small seam of
gouge-like material on either side. The
ledge has widened out within the last
few feet from six inches to two feet,
with every reason to believe that it
will continue to widen as the tunnel is
pushed ahead. Work on the tunnel
will be resumed as supp $3 financial ar
rangements can be made to thtt end.
Climax. — This mine has beon bond
ed to Dr. P. B. Aiken and other parties
from the city, who are now engaged in
development work thereon. The prop
erty was formerly known as the Reed
& Askey. Some very rich rock was
taken therefrom years ago, but foi- a
number of years jt has been idle.
Fremont.— The construction of the
40 stamp mill is proceeding satisfactori
ly The building is approaching com
pletion, and a portion of the machinery
is on the ground ready to be put in
plt£e, -The gallows frame is also fin
ished a 9 far as the c&ipentep lf.qrk ie
concerned. . This is one of the tallest
gallows frames in the county. It rises
96 feet from the ground. It will be ex
ceeded however by the gallows frame
for the new hoist at the Kennedy,
which'wili be J£o feet to tan t&p.
Lincoln. — A meeting of the direct
ors of this company was held early in
the week, at which it was definitely
decided to close down. The work of
taking up the track is now in progress.
This may take a couple of weeks to
finish, at the. end of which time the
property will revert to (idleness. The
company have expended in the neigh
borhood of $200,000 in prospecting.
They have searched it thoroughly,
and used good judgment and economy
in al} th.c Qperijtipns. They do not feel
justified in' continuing the work. "i. 1 .
J. Clavering, representing the owners
of the Lincoln,- was present, also Mr.
Stent, a large stockholder, after whom
the town of Stent in Tuolumne was
named. A proposition was made to
consolidate the Lincoln, an<J Mahqijey
properties, and continue' work. This
was favorably considered at first, but
finally it was deemed inadvisable to
press it under existing conditions.

upon him, and affecting his health,
and he concluded to surrender his po

Herbert Bright was called home Mon
day, by receipt of a dispatch informing
him of the dangerous illness of his
wife. Last Sunday the condition of
Mrs. Bright was extremely critical,
necessitating the attendance of Drs.
Endicott and Gall nearly all day. For
several hours she was under the In
fluence pf cbjoroform. When her
husband arrived he was qyerjpyed to
find that she was out of danger, and
rapidly recovering.
A Veritable Graveyard *
To those acquainted with the facts,
the. boast of the Dispatch about the
value of its advertising columns, and
the prices demanded for space in that
sheet, is amusing. As a matter of fact
its advertising columns a.re 4 veritable
graveyard. Ads of all sizes and grades
are carried week after week, and month
after month, from which tho proprietor
has not reaped, and never expects to
reap, one cent. Some of these proposi
tions were offered to the Ledger, and
rejected without even the formality of
a reply, such was the absurd and un
profitable fjature p,f the prqposition.
And yet they grace the business columns
of the dispatch with just the same reg
ularity as paying matter. Certainly
advertising space must bo very valuable
un^er suoh conditions. On ' the" other
hand, the Ledger's policy is not to in
sert any business advertising, other
than on a cash basis. All land lotteries,

LABOR UNION SITUATION
Friction Continues Between Western
Federation and American Feder
ation Organizations.
John C. Williams of Nevada county,
who is vice president of the Western
Federation of Miners, has been in the
county for the past week, looking into
the labor situation in this county. The
object of his visit is mainly to endeavor
to get the engineers and others of the
various mines who are now organized
under the banner of the American
Federation to join the Western Federa
tion. The principal point of friction is
the mines around Amador City. Mr.
Williams has Interviewed C. R. Downs,
superintendent of the Bunker Hill,
Arthur Goodall, superintendent of the
Fremont, and others in regard to the
matter. Some very disquieting re
ports wore in circulation in reference
to the substance of these interviews,
giving the impression that further
labor troubles were pending. That
impression predominates around Ama
dor City. Special meetings have been
held there the past week, also a' meet
ing in Sutter Creek, to which the mem
bers of the American Federation were
invited,- was held Sunday evening.
This was addressed by Mr. Williams,
who stated the position of his organiza
tion, and cordially invited them to
identify themselves wlt.h the organiza
tion which he represented.
Among the mine owners and business
men generally, especially in the central
part of the county, the feeling of un
rest has been greatly increased. On
Wednesday Mr. Williams was in Jack
son, and the editor of the Ledger avail
ed himself of tho opportunity of inter
viewing him. He stated the object of
his mission was nqt stride. A^ strike
was the farthest from their intentions;
no special meeting had been called for
the 10th of August to vote on a strike
proposition.
The situation seems to be about as
follows:
The Western Federation contends
that the mining sectiun is their special
field; they do not invade the p|tles.,
leaving that field for the American
Federation and otherorganizations. It
is necessary to maintain their position,
they claim, to have the engineers of all
the miqes. within t*}eir jurisdiction in
their organization. When asked what
was meant by the expression, "to
maintain our position," the answer
was, "to endeavor to improve the con
ditions of those employed in and around
the mines." There was no objection
to engineers and others belonging to
the American Federation as well, but
they had to have them in their union.
In other words, they wanted to domi
nate the situation.
The American Federation men on
tho other hand are satisfied to remain
where they are. They do not want to
belong to two labor organizations. The
mine owners will not discriminate
either for or against them on account of
belonging to either uniqn tq no
union. We understand the time given
in which all those working in and
around the mines of the Amador dis
trict are to join the Western Federa
tion has open extended, tq the 18, th of
Augqst. Wb,at will occur then in case
they fail to join is not said. All idea of
strike is repudiated by the leaders. A
strike is the furthest from their
thoughts they say. But the impression
left upQn the minds of the representa
tives of tho mines Is that the miners of
the Western Federation, while not de
claring a strike, will decline to work
with those non-members. A demand
for the discharge of non-union men, or
American Federation men, if met
with a refusal, followed by a re
fusal of the others to work, a vjalk-out
or a lpc.k-put, is likely' to "be the out
come, resulting in ajie-up of the mines
involved, unless qther men can be got
to operate them. The outlook is any
thing b,ut r.ea.sstyriug,

Double Homicide at Ban Andreas.
A lamentable affair occurred at San
Andreas last Sunday, resulting in the
death of two men— one James Casey,
who was acting as deputy constable at
the time. It seems that a man named
Martinez was intoxicated, and was giv
ing some trouble on the outskirts of the
town. Casey went out to arrest him,
the offender submitting without any
show of resistance. He took him to the
county jail, and with the aid of deputy
sheriff Thorn was about to search him
for weapons, when the prisoner sud
denly pulled a revolver and commenced
shooting at Casey, firing several shots
at close range. Casey was killed in
stantly. Thorn then engaged in a life
or-death tussle with the 'desperado,
hitting him over the head with a- din
ner bucket. Tho prisoner broke loose,
andescaped tq the street, and made
haste out of town. The news of the
killing spread quickly, and the three
brothers of the dead officer, armed
with pistols, took the trail of the fugi
tive. He was still disposed to show
fight, so the Caseys opened fire and
dropped him at the first volley. He
was mortally wounded, and conveyed
back to town.
James Casey, the official victim of
the killing, was in Jackson last year
duringthetimethatCasey, his brother,
was running the Central hotel. His
taking off at the hands of a, desperado,
while doing bis official duty, Is deeply
regretted by all.
Catarrh of the Stomach.
When the stomach is overloaded;
when food is taken into it that fails to
digest, it decays and inflames the muc
ous membrane, exposing the nerves,
and causes the glands to secret mucin,
instead of the natural juices of diges
tion. This Is called Catarrh of the
Stomach. For years 1 suffered with

The District Attorney Calls for their Sup
pression.
Office of the District Attorney,
Amador County, California.
Jackson, Cal., July 30, 1903.
Mr. T. K. Norman,
. Sheriff of Amador County, Cal.
Dear Sir:— -
. I am in receipt of a petition signed
by a great number of the leading busi
ness men of Amador county, earnestly
requesting that the law prohibiting
the operation of slot machines of
chance be enforced.
Section 330 of the Penal Code pro
vides as follows:
"Every person who deals, plays,' or
carries on, opens, or causes to "be open
ed,-or who conducts, either as owner
or employee, whether for hire or not,
any game of faro, monte, roulette,
lansquenet, rouge et noir, rondo, tan,
fan-tan, stud-horse poker, seven-and-a
half, twenty-one, hokey-pokey, or any
banking or percentage game played
with cards, dice," or any -device, for
money, checks, credit, or other repre
sentative of value, and every person
who plays or bets at or against any of
said prohibited games, is guilty of a
misdemeanor, and shall be punishable
by a : fine not less than one hundred
dollars nor more than five hundred
dollars, or by imprisonment in - the*
county jail not exceeding six, months,
or by both such fine and imprison
ment."
It is the opinion of this office that
the so-called slot machines, as now
operated in this county, are banking
games within the meaning of the Sec
tion of the Penal Code above ' quoted.
It has been so held by several superior
courts in this state, and also by our
supreme court.
Your duties in this matter are laid
down in Section 89 of the County Gov
ernment Act, and also in Section 335 ot
the Penal Code of this state.
Yours respectfully,
C. P. ViciNr,
District Attorney of Amador County.

THE jPIADOR LEDaER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. JULY 31, 1 903.
First Women on the English Stage.
It is only with the restoration drama
that the annals of actresses on the
English stage begin. Queen Henrietta
Maria, wife of Charles 1., had early
made a vain attempt to introduce the
French fashion of female players into
her adopted country by the establish
ment of a French company composed
only of women in London. But the ex
periment was premature, and the for
eigners were hissed and pelted off the
stage at their first performance. .
Until 1660 the female parts had al
ways been taken by boys, and the cus
tom survived even after women had
taken their place upon the stage, since
some of the more famous of the boy
actors (grown into men) continued oc
casionally to play their favorite roles
as late as the end of the seventeenth
century. Kynaston, the chief boy actor,
survived till 1699, long after the ladles
had ousted him from the principal
parts, and in 1661 Pepys, who saw him
in the "Silent Woman," speaks of him
as "the liveliest lady for a boy" he had
ever seen.
Advice.
The best advice that can be given
probably is: Take all the advice you
can get and then do as you please. The
successful person, or the one whom the
crowd counts successful, is being con
stantly besieged with applications for
advice how to succeed. He is generally
incapable of giving it The same ad
vice, outside of a few maxims gener
ally applicable, is seldom good for two
persons. Advice, as a rule, is cheap
and about as valuable as most cheap
things. To be constantly following ad
vice without stopping to consider its
source is the plain mark of weakness.
It is this trait of weak human nature
which makes the business of the pat
ent medicine maker so profitable. The
person of power is the one who neither
gives nor takes advice in generous
quantities. The world would be better
off if advice were much less plentiful.
Then, perhaps, its quality might rise in
proportion to its scarcity. — New Lon
don Telegraph.
Sleep.
Sleep begins, in its first phase, by a
state of distraction which brings on
states of absent mindedness accompa
nied always by numerous and separate
hallucinations closely connected with
the length of the absent minded states.
Immediately afterward, in a second
phase, these states of distraction pass
into a very delicate motor disturbance,
due to the absence of parallelism in
the axes of the eyes or by the devia
tion of their conjugate movements.
Then, in a third and final phase, which
indicates the very near approach of
actual sleep, the vasomotor system
seems to conform to laws very differ
ent from those that regulate its mech
anism during waking hours.— Revue
Sclentiflque.
A Gentleman.
What is it to be a gentleman? Is it
to have lofty alms, to lead a pure life,
I to keep your honor virgin, to have the
. esteem of your fellow citizens and the
i love of your fireside, to bear good for
tune meekly, to suffer evil with con
■ stancy, and through evil and good to
; maintain truth always? Show me the
j Happy man whose life exhibits these
i qualities, and him we will salute as
gentleman, whatever his rank may be.
. Show me the prince who possesses.

ffpera Under Difficulties.
Slgnor Ardltl tells the following story
In his autobiography: -"During my first
long stay in America our company was
anuounced for one night, during a ter
ribly cold winter, at Washington. Shall
I ever forget the bitter cold of that sea
son? It was as though we had sudden
ly been transported to the arctic . re
gions, and the theater In which we had
our performance was as inadequate to
cope with the frost as though we bad
fixed up a summer tent for the purpose.
'Xorma' was the opera, and Grisi, in
ttead of appearing in her traditional
white robe with flowing folds, was
compelled to come on the stage wear
ing a huge fur cloak in which she was
huddled up almost to ber eyes. The
house only really rose to the occasion
with loud bursts of laughter when
Mario made his entrance holding a
coachman's umbrella over his head —
he, as Polllo, being confronted by Nor
ma in their tragical meeting — under
which prosaic safeguards both artists
cowered while singing their grand duo.
The roof of the theater had given way
under the weight of a heavy fall of
snow, • and its coating of ice, melting
under the heat of the gas, was stream
ing down on the artists."
Ancient Ideas of Africa,
, In mediaeval times_ Africa was an
unknown continent as well as Asia.
Until a few years after the discovery
of Columbus no one had sailed around
it, and It was quite generally thought, I
as it had previously been thought in j
regard to Asia, that the African contl v
nent extended on and on indefinitely.
It was supposed that far to the south
was the zone of heat, in which no hu
man' being could live. This was by no
means an unreasonable inference to
the ancients. They knew that the far
ther they sailed to the" north the' colder
it grew and that in the extreme north
was a region of perpetual ice and snow.
They also knew .that the farther they
sailed to the south the warmer it grew,
and what was more natural for them
to suppose that if they went far enough
in that direction they would come upon
lands that were parched and baked
and upon seas that boiled, where noth
ing could live but salamanders?
He Conld Wield an Ax.
■ Queer and racy are the tales told of
the skill of the Maine shipbuilders in
the use of the adz and broadax. One
old time yarn is of a carpenter who ap
plied very drunk at a shipyard for em
ployment. In order to have a little fun
with him the foreman set him to give a
proof of his skill by hewfng out a
wooden bolt with no chopping block
but a stone. The carpenter accomplish
ed his difficult task without marring
the keen edge of the broadax and
showed the foreman a neatly made
bolt. Then he brought the ax down
with a terrific blow that shattered its
edge upon the stone. "I can hew fust
rate on your chopping block," he hic
coughed, "but I'll be blamed if I can
make the ax stick in it when I git
through." The story runs that the
foreman lost no time in employing
such a workman.
How the Patent Office Was Saved.
When in the war of 1812 the British,
who had taken Washington, trained
their guns upon the patent office, ' Dr.
Thornton, throwing himself directly
before the guns, cried:
"Are you Englishmen or Ootbs and
Vandals? This is the patent office— a
depository of the ingenuity and inven
tions of the American nation, in which
the whole civilized world is interested.
Would you destroy it? Then let the
charge pass through my body."
And the building was spared. Twen
ty-four years afterward, however, it
was destroyed by fire, together with
everything in it
Localizing; Her Emotions.
Our minister during a call sang one
of those touching, simple melodies
which Edith is so fond of hearing. She
was very attentive, gazing on his face
■with her bright, wondering eyes. As
the song continued tears began to glis
ten beneath the lids and glide down
her dimpled cheeks. After a few min
utes' silence he asked:
"Edith, how do you like it?"
"Oh, very much, Mr. Webb; but it
hurts my eyes."— Little Chronicle.

If there had not been a wedding at
620 Granville avenue, there might not
have been one exactly two months lat
tv at 325, just across the way.
The wedding had been the finest that
the pretty southern town had seen for
many a day. Now that it was over
there was a small- brigade of caterers
aad florists' assistants scurrying about
packing up cut glass and candelabra
and shoving camp chairs and portable
palms into prosaic carts. Alice Doro
thy, ' flattening her little nose against
the window pane in the house oppo
site in her eagerness to see the very
last ol it, sighed regretfully.
Last night, for one brief, blissful mo
ment, mamma had held her up to kiss
the bride In all her glory, of veil and
flowers and shimmeriDg satin. Then
she had been hurried home with Hep
zy.
And this morning there was nothing
left of it all but a few wilted chrysan
themums scattered on- the walk and a
trail of rice across the lawn. The beau
tiful dream had vanished; but, oh, how

she longed to have a wedding of her
very own! Mamma had gone out, but
perhaps Hepzy would talk to her about
it again.
Hepzy, the good natured, was in the
upper room making beds. Alice Doro
thy sped upstairs as fast as her dimin
utive legs would carry her.
"Oh, Hepzy," she burst out, her
bright face rosy with running and ar
dent interest, "won't mamma let us
have a wedding some time too?"
"Bress yo' heart, honey, dar couldn't
be no weddln' 'tuout a bride nohow!"
"But, Hepzy, mamma could be that.
She's more prettier 'n Miss Edif."
Hepzy's fat sides began to heave as
she pfllted a pillow into its proper ro
tundity, her black palm silhouetted

"I don' reckon, chile, yo' maw's much
notion o' marryin' ag'ln, seeln' she's
hed one cl'ar 'scape."
"What's a cl'ar 'scape, Hepzy?"
"Lawd bress de chile! It ain't nuthin'
dat consuns one livin' soul but hu'self,
honey. An' howsomever dar ain't nevah
bin no weddin' 'thout a brid'groom,
shuah's yo' bawn, 111' gal."
"A bwidegoom?"
"Yaas, chile; suttin' shuah—de pus
son wot stan' nex' de bride an' hoi' hu'.
bokay while she am a-fas'nen of hu'
glub."
Alice Dorothy was silent for a brief
instant in the face of this unlooked for
obstacle. -Then, with a ; thoughtful
pucker on the little forehead, "P'raps
we could get one. Hepzy."
"Now yo' is ofT'n de trac'. III* gal.
Dar ain't no gittin' 'bout it. He jus'
come, an' come hisself till by an' by he
leabe off a-comin' an' teks de bride off
to his own residumps."
"Oh," explained the perplexed little
questioner, with a dimpling smile of
illumination, "Mr. Donal' comes nearly
every day. ~. P'raps he would be th'
bwidegoom!"
"Fo' heaben's sake, chile, wot am de
mattab wif yo' sawsh dat yo' maw
done tie so scrumptious 'fore she done
gone out? It's a-draggin' on de flo
lak a monkey's talll"
The little girl laughed gleefully at
the picture. Hepzy had successfully
turned the drift of conversation, which,
as she declared to Mann Smith that
afternoon with numerous fat chuckles,
she felt " 'bleeged to do, fo' de bressed
chile was gittin' too pussonal."
Mamma and Alice Dorothy had been
swinging to and fro in the big rocker
for a long time that evening. When
the little girl, nestling closer, had asked
in her sweet, lisping fashion if they
couldn't have a wedding some time like
Miss Edlfs, an' did she flnk that Mr.
Donal' would come, too, 'cause Hep
«y said there couldn't be none 'thout a
bwidegoom, mamma had kissed her
quickly on the mouth and told her
never, never to say anything like that
again. '■-■•'■■''■
"And mamma's little girl must be
very quiet, too, when— anybody calls,
because"— with a half sigh— "mamma's
afraid that— Mr. Donald doesn't like
little girls." li.:^%

messenger had come to say that Mrs.
Nelson bad just received word that her
sou had been killed and "would Mrs.
Cranston come over for | awhile until
her sister could get there."
Alice Dorothy had a tiny scheme
tucked away in her active little brain.
She was pleased when mamma j had
turned on the lights and told her she
might "sit up" awhile in the big rocker.
It was very still in the, house after
mamma had gone, and the small eye
lids drooped heavily. Then the bell
rang again, and the half closed eyes
flew wide open as their owner gave a
quick little breath. : ,
Yes, she was. sure he would come!
There he stood looking down at the
round, frizzly head. He was saying
something about finding her alone! He
Was big and broad shouldered, and his
eyes were smiling at her. j
The child gazed at him very seriously
and very critically for a moment, and
then the dimples broke.
"I fought p'raps you'd come," she
said, looking up at him ecstatically.
"You were looking for me, then?",
"Yes. I wanted t* ask if you'd be
th' bwidegoom at our wedding an'
stan' "by the cuttings wif th' bu'ful
bwide!"
"Whose wedding, Alice * Dorothy?
Yours?" There was a note of eager
curiosity in the questioning voice. •. . .
"Yes; mine an', mamma's. ..Hepzy
says we mus' have a bwidegoom like
Miss Edlf had, an' I fought p'raps
you'd be it!"
He lifted the- child in his arms and
sat down in the roomy rocker. \
Alice Dorothy nestled close to him
confidingly. He was not smiling now,
but the child's quick instinct told her
that he could be relied upon. She liked
Mr. Donald very much.
"An' my mamma she fought we
could never have a bu'ful wedding
'cause p'raps you don't like little gulls,
an' it made her sorry to fink 'bout
that." r-^uJ
"Did she say that little one?"
"No, she dint say it; she on'y vis
pered." L??i
Mr. Donald sat up very straight. He
seemed to forget that Alice Dorothy
was there.
It was very uncomfortable sitting
like that. And what did jhe mean
when he kissed her hair so suddenly
and called her a little "angel of light",
and said that he understood now— it
was quite clear— and he hoped they
would all be very happy yet.
And now he was holding her tight In
hia arms, his brown cheek close to her
soft pink one, rocking slowly to and
fro. In spite of everything the drowsy
eyelids would drop over the happy,
sleepy eyes.
"An' It will— be-th' mos' bu'fulest
wedding— an' Mr. Donal'— you do like—
—little gulls— 'splain to— to mamma,
please, so she— w-o-o-n't be— sorry—
an"'-
The man and the child were very
quiet now. One had slipped away In
to dreamland and the other was fash
ioning a fine dream of his own.

When Alice Dorothy awoke, she was
In her own little bed, and mamma was
bending over her, her face hidden In
the child's silky curls.
"The bwidegoom taked care of me,
mamma, an'— an' "—sleepily— "did he
'splain f "you— 'bout— little— gulls?"
"Yes, darling; he has explained,

Alice Dorothy did not hear the rest.
Mamma's voice was too soft or too far
away; but two months later, lacking
one day, she had a wedding of her
very own. ?.v '-,
Both 'Word aid Thing.
I do not know whether It was from
overwork or why it was, but every
now and then Farrar had an unfortu
nate habit of mechanically repeating
himself. During one term, when this
habit was at its worst, we used to have
weekly lessons in the Septuagint, in
every other verse of which the Greek
words for "word" and "work" are In
terchanged. Regularly every Monday
morning he used to explain this confu
sion in these .words, "The reason why
'ergon* is used here instead of 'logos'
is that It is a translation of the Hebrew
word Dabar, which means both word
and thing." Those four last monosyl
lables used to boom forth like Big Ben
striking four or like the sound of two
great amens. j One Monday morning
Thersites, who sat next to me, whis
pered in my ear: "We have not had
Dabar yet Shall I get it?" I replied,
"Do if you dare." And he unblushing
ly asked why "ergon" was used instead
of "logos" in the passage which had
just been translated. "Ah!" said our
revered master. "You could not be
expected to know that But the rea
son," etc. It came out verbatim. He
walked with stately tread straight into
the open trap. Thersites remained
"looking wistfully with wide blue eyes
as in a picture."— Cornhill Magazine.

"There's nothing the matter with this
carpet, my dear," remarked Niggard
to his wife, who was cleaning house
and said she couldn't make the place
look nice unless there was a new floor
covering to the front room. "All it
needs is a good beating," he continued.
After beating a merry tattoo on the
carpet with a stick out In the back
yard for half an hour, Niggard, with
an exultant expression on his face,
called to his wife:
"Come here, my dear. See, It looks
Just as good as a new one."
■ "I don't see how you can say such
a thing," replied his wife, with tears in
her eyes. "It's Just as faded as it ever
was and you've only made more holes

"Do you mean to say I don't know

Niggard, his vanity touched.

would be. "You are going to shun

A book by Captain Markharn of the
British army tells of experiences iri
Westminster school, London, some
thing over half a century ago. He de
scribes the "handings" of those days.
The back of the hand was extended,
while the master, standing behind,
smote it with a rod, which "curled over
a little" and left a cut, and the culprit,
facing the school, observed the eti
quette of the occasion by wearing an
expression of "scornful amusement."
Captain Markham also describes "tan
ning," which was administered with
the butt end of a rod upon the backs of
the boys' legs. He recalls the code of
honor, which was merciless to the boy
who broke his word or allowed another
to suffer for his offense, but permitted
"any amount of humbugging of a mas
ter." When disinclined for school you
said, "I don't feel very well, sir," and
before the master inspected your
tongue you gave "the upper surface a
hard pressure with -your upper teeth,
and out came a tongue white enough to
satisfy any doctor."
Underground Waters.
The earth contains an abundance of
water, even in places like some of our
great western plateaus where the sur
face is comparatively arid. The great
est depth at which underground water
can exist is estimated to be about six
miles. Below j that it is believed, the
cavities and pores of the rock are com
pletely closed. \ The amount of water
in the earth's crust: is reckoned at
nearly a third of that contained in the
oceans, so that it would cover the
whole surface of the globe to a depth
of from 3,000 to 3,500 feet The waters
underground flow horizontally after
sinking below the unsaturated zone of
the rocks, but in the sands of the Da
kota formation, which supply remark
able artesian wells', the motion does
not exceed one or two miles a year.
The underflow toward the sea beneath
the great plains may sometimes take
the form of broad streams or moving
sheets of water, but the movement is
excessively slow.— Youth's Companion.
Indians Have Hard Teeth.
■ "I don't care for Indians as patients,"
said a dentist the other day. "No; it
isn't that they are objectionable per
sonally; it is just because there is no
money to be made out of them at regu
lar rates. The hardness of an Indian's
tooth is something to marvel at, and
if I had many of them to treat I should
be forced to have instruments of un
usual strength made to order. The
ordinary kind won't stand the pressure.
I filled one cavity in a red man's tooth
the other day, and before I got through
I had turned the edges of no less than
twenty drills. There isn't much money
In that sort of work, Is there? And
talk about the Indian's vaunted stoi
cism and imperviousness to pain! Why,
that fellow yelled every time I touched
him! I've had six-year-old children be
have better in the chair."—Philadel
phia Record.
Sentiment Versus Fact.
That the advance preparation of
speeches will not always conform to
circumstances was made evident dur
ing a flag raising at a public school.
The young orator had been speaking
for several minutes when he advanced
to the front of the platform, raised his
hand with a dramatic gesture to the
flag on the staff above him and shouted:
"See yon flag throwing its protecting
folds to the breeze of freedom!"
Mt was a pretty sentiment, but the
"breeze" didn't bear out the picture.
The flag, to which all eyes were imme
diately turned, hung as limp as if it
had been dipped in water.
Grievances.

man has a grievance. On the last day

Over His Patient's Head.
When the doctor, who forgot what
kind of medicine his patient was tak
ing, asked, "Was it a fluid medicament
I prescribed for you the last time?" the
puzzled German patient answered:
"I don't know vot id vos. You said
I shud take fife drobs dree dimes a day

"After my First baby was born I did not
seem to regain my strength although the
doctor gave me a tonic which he consid-
ered very superior, but instead of getting
better I grew weaker every day. My hus-
band insisted that I take Wine of Cardui
for a week and see what it would do for
me. I did take the medicine and was very
grateful to find my strength and health
slowly returning. In two weeks. I was out

up my usual duties. lam very enthusi-
astic in its praise."
Wine of Cardui reinforces the organs
of generation for the ordeal of preg-
nancy and childbirth. It prevents mis-

of Cardui need fear the coming of her
