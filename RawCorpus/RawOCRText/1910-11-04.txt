Notice to Voters !
Jackson, Cal., Nov. Und, 1910.
To the Electors
of Amador County :—
Owing to the great amount of work
n my offices incident to the three
elections thia year, to wit :— The pri
mary, tne high school, and general
elections, I have found it utterly im
possible to give these matters my per
sonal attention they demand and which
in my opinion they deserve, and also
make a canvass for the office to which
I seek re-election.
I si ncerly trust the voters will
understand and appreciate [; my posi
tion; never before in this county, has
the clerk'B office been required to
handle three olections in less than
three months; |by long hours and
j hard work will be able to discharge
these additional duties without asking
the supervisors for extra help, which
to the taxpayers will be some saving.
I appreciate the splendid vote giv?n
me by the people of Amador county at
the recent primary election and take
this opportunity to thank them there
for and to assure them that I have
tried hard to merit their confidence.
To every man who votes for me on
November Bth, I shall indeed be grate
ful.
Very respectfully,
JOHN R. HUBERTFY,
County Clerk & Auditor.

Primary Law Has
Many Freak Results
The primary election played many
curious antics. When a man is nomij
nated on the ticket by the majority
votes of any party having a place on
the ballot, there is no way of getting
his name off the printed ballot. It
may be he is not in sympathy with
the doctrines of the party whose nomi
nation he receives, without any seek
ing on his part, nevertheless he must
stay with it. This is apt to give birth
to wrong views concerning the candi
date. For instance, Grove L. Johnson
was a candidate at the primaries for
assemblyman. He was defeated by
Charles A. Bliss, who is the regular
republican candidate. But Johnson
received one vote on the prohibition
ticket, and was thereby made the pro
hibition candidate for that office. He
is not and never was a prohibitionist,
but he cannot get off the ticket.
In this county, similar pranks were
played by the primary law.
U S Gregory received the socialist nom
ination for sheriff by a lone vote. His
name will go on the ballot as the
nominee of that party for sheriff as
well as the democratic nominee. His
republican nominee, John S. Davis
received a vote or two on the prohibi
tion ticket, and was made the nominee
of that party for sheriff, without any
seeking on his part. He is not a pro
hibitionist, but a republican out and
out. His name must therefore appear
on the ballot as the regular nominee of
that party, which nomination he was
not seeking, as well as the republican
nominee, which honor he was seeking.
We make this explanation to avoid
any misunderstanding. These scatter
ing nomination have no bearing what
ever upon the sentiments of the parties
nominated.
Caminetti's Poor

The official figures of the primary
election are to hand. They show a
surprising vote on the state senator
ship in this district, Howard, the re
publican candidate, running clean away
from Caminetti, his democratic oppo

classes are fighting Caminetti, and the
vote shows that something is adrift.

Struck Wrong A/lan
Last Saturday night, while the
democratic rally Was in progress, a
man considerably under the influence
of liquor, persisted in annoying many
people in the crowd which had as
sembled to listen to the speakers, by
begging money and abusing all whore
fused him. The fellow asked one man
too many, and before he knew it, city
marshal Sanguinetti had him on his
way to the lockup, where he spent the
night reflecting on his ill fortcne.
Next morning the city marshal es
corted the man who could give no
place of residence to the city limits,
and after a warning bid him an adieu.
Another deaf and dumb grafter ' was
given the same send-off by our city
marshal the same day.
KILLED IN MINE
Victim of Fatal Accident
.-. /.--.Leaves Family to
Mourn Loss
A fatal accident occurred in the
South Eureka mine on Friday night
last. Shaft repairing is in progress at
the mine. At the time of the fatality,
Nick Glavinich and a number of others
were working in ths - shaft, Glavinich
being one of the crew employed
at a point 90 feet below the 2500
level. About nine o'clock a big
block of timber, such as is used in
shaft work, got loose, and fell down
the shaft. How it came to fall we
are unable to say. The block struck
Glavinich in the head, knocking him
down the shaft. He fell about 150
feet. The fall must have killed him
almost instantly. The body was badly
mangled on one side. Coroner Potter
held an inquest the followng day, the
jury -finding a verdict of accidental
death. The funeral was held last
Monday, under the auspices of the
Austrian Benevolent Society, of which
lodge the deceased has long been a
member. The remains were buried
in the Catholic cemetery. Rev. Father
Gleeson officiating. . .-, ' ■•-.■• • •'
The deceased was 48 years of age,
and a native of Austria. He had
been a resident of this county for
about 20 years, employed most of the
time in the mines of this vicinity.
He leaves a wife and three children,
also a brother and other relatives.
His family are residing in Newman

REPUBLICAN
RALLIES BIG
Speekers Enthusiastic
ally Greeted Along
Entire Route
The meetings of the republican
county candidates were opened at Dry
town last Thursday, October 27th,
and reports are circulated that the
opening night was one of the most
enthusiastic that the town has ever
witnessed.
The party, after bushwacking in the
lower part of the county all day Fri
day, again assembled at Buena Vista
where another rousing reception was
tendered the candidates.
On Saturday evening Hon. G. F.
McNoble of Stockton, was present
with the party at lone, and spoke on
state and national issues. The meet
ing at lone, as were the two previous
meetings, all that could be expected.
Most of the party returned to their
homes on Sunday and had a day of rest
with their families, starting out on
Monday morning to visit Plymouth
and vicinity.
A rousing meeting was held at Ply
mouth on Monday night, and each of
the candidates report full satisfaction
with tne general outlook in that loca
lity.
On Wednesday evening Volcano did
herself credit to the republican party.
Nothing more in the way of a recep
tion could have been expected, and
the applause greeting each candidate
as he was introduced, was stimulant
enough for the weakest speaker to do
himself full credit, in explaining the
many necessities and the stern qualifi
cations which are required by the
officer.
Pine Grove was reached •on Thurs
day night, and here another large and
enthusiastic audience was faced. This
district is now claimed by the republi
can party and next Tuesday will
verify the report we feel sure.
..." To night will start the real fight for
Honors and offices, as the aspirants
have the honor of addressing ' the
citizens of Amador and an exceptional
ly large turnout is expected.
This is the home John S. Davis, the
republican candidate for sheriff, and
it is claimed he will carry his town by
a big vote.
LICENSE ISSUE WARM
Attempt to Mislead Voters
in Explaining Case
The chief burden of the speeches of
U. S. Gregory and C. P. Vicini
throughout the county has been to
clear themselves in the matter of the
uncollected licenses and free licenses
to John Ratto. The fallacy of the
arguments resorted to in the effort to
befog the people on this issue needs to
be shown. In defense of Kattto's
freedom from contributing anything
toward the support of the county
government these advocates of non
payment claim that Ratto is a poor
man, and unable to pay a county
license. The comparison was made
with the poor man trying to keep out
of the poorhouse by peddling trinkets
on the street. Ratto was held up as a
subject of sympathy, unable to make
a living except by bumming on the
taxpayers. This is anything but com
plimentary to Ratto.
The truth is Ratto is a young man,
single and able-bodied. He pays a
city license for conducting his show in
Jackson— pays it because the city
authorities— unlike the county mana
gers—insist upon his contributing his
share for the governmental protection
afforded him. He is well able to pay,
because he has done a thriving busi
ness---as good a busines as any one in
Jackson. If he can pay here he can
pay the county license for show
ing in Sutter Creek also. If he is not
doing a paying business there, why
not quit, and let some one else try. If
he is doing a paying business on the
outside, the poverty plea, miserable as
it is, will not hold. He is not dependent
upon the outside show business, with
its shirked license, for a living, but
upon the Jackson business, where he
has to pay a license. The truth is,
the basis of the free license is politi
cal, and nothing else.
Seriously 111
Mrs W. P. Peek is guttering from
an attack oi pneumonia, and Miss
Cassela, a trained nurse, is attending
her. She is in a critical condition.
Closed Out Business
R. S. Bierce, who has been conduct
ing an exclusively shoe store in Jack
son for several years, in the front of
Love's hall, has closed out his busi
ness, and intends to leave with his
family for other parts. He has been
negotiating to form a partnership in
the shoe repairing line, with improved
machinery. The stock of Regal shoes
which he carried for sale on commis
sion, was packed up and shipped back
to the factory. The other stock, we
are informed, was assigned to the
creditors. The vacated premises may
be occupied by T. J. Burrows, the
manager of the electric light company,
and be fixed up for the sale of
electric supplies, etc.
SUICIDE MANIA
Johnson Succeeds In
Taking Life By
Drowning
Oscar Johnson, a Swede employed at
various mines about Jackson, who at
tempted suicide on Wednesday night of
last week, and was only fustrated in
his act by the timely arrival of several
men who heard his moans after he
had slashed his throat and windpipe,
is missing.
Johnson wandered away from the
county hospital, to which institution
he was committed after his first act
upon his own life, and was successful
ly treated by Dr. A. M. Gall, who
sewed up the ugly gashes which were
sell-inflicted.
Nothing more was seen or heard
about him. until Harry Richards and
Dick Penrose found some clothing on
a small raft of the Argonaut Mine
reservoir, and they immediately re
ported the facts to the authorities in
Jackson. An investigation found that
the clothes belonged to Oscar John
son, the man who had secretly left
the county home.
Several men were dispatched to the
scene with grappling irons.
Constable Laverone and John Gar
barini dragged the reservoir as well as
the imperfect implements at their com
mand would allow. The water is 15
feet deep in the center, and there was
no boat available, so that the groping
for the body wus unsatisfacatory and
resultless.
The general feoling is that a human
body is concealec by the water. Some
think that the supposed victim tried to
create the impression of suicide, and
has decamped. His full clothing was
not left, only hat and coat— the latter
saturated with blood from the gashed
throat, and the hat recognized by con
stable Laverone as the one he had
given him when taken to the hospital.
The water for the supply of Jackson
for domestic purposes comes through
the Argonaut reservoir, and this im
parts a serious phase to the matter.
The district attorney, who was away
on a campaign tour, was notified, and
arrived Wednesday. The matter of
draining the reservoir was mentioned
as the most satisfactory solution, but
the question of who should bear the
cost proved a bone of contention. It
would necessitate a shut down of the
Argonaut hoist, which is operated by
water power, for two or three days, at
a loss of several hundred dollars. The
company was in no way to blame, and
should not bear the loss, the officials
contended. On the other band the
county and city authorities were averse
to making it a public charge.
Yesterday, by means of a glass ap
paratus to see through the water, an
effort was made to locate the body, but
without success, the sun being too low.
Anotner effort will be made to-day.
If it fails, the emptying of the reser
voir will be imperative.
The people of Jackson are uneasy.
Hdyrant water is discarded for domes
tic purposes, and the wells are being
resorted to in the emergency. The sit
uation is becoming acute.
Jordan Visits City
Frank A. Jordan and wife paid
Jackson a visit on Thursday last, en
route from Sonora to Sacramento.
They spent the night at the county
seat, and Mr Jordan proceeded to hand
out stock certificates fur shares to
the Society of Good Friends, and or
ganization that has a membership of
over 60,000 at the present time. Jor
dan is candidate for secretary of state
on the republican ticket.

HIGH SCHOOL
GETS BOOST
Entire County In Sym
pathy With the
Movement
The campaign that is now being
waged throughout the county in the
interest of tne high school movement
is meeting with encouragement in all
Hections, and there is no doubt enter
tained of the success of the proposi
tion at the forthcoming special elec
tion. Enthusiastic meetings have been
held in Drytown, Plymouth, Oleta,
Voclano and Pine Grove, and the cam
paign will close in Jackson, to-night,
at the grand rally to be held under the
auspices of the High School Boosters'
Club of Jackson. Plans are also under
way for a meeting in Amador City
Sunday night, as Professor Green
halgh does not v/ish to leave out any
part of the county in his campaign of
education. The meeting scheduled for
Amador City was cancelled owing to
the quarantine against scarlet fever,
but as this, embargo has been lifted,
it is desired to give the people of that
city an opportunity to listen to the
I arguments in favor of the high school.
Especial interest in the movement
has been manifested in the "astern
section of the county, where largely
attended meetings were held, on Tues
day night in Volcano, and at Pine
Grove the following evening. The
citizens of Volcano turned out en
masse Tuesday evening to listen to
the speakers whom Mr Greenhalgh
had enlisted to assist him in his work.
The Cook band rendered assistance by
the rendition of stirring and appro
priate selections before and during
the meeting ; the school children at
tended in a body, and aroused enthus
iasm of the assemhly by their stirring
rally song and rally yell. The meet

DEMOCRATS
PLEAD CAUSE
CandidatesßeciteStero
typed Addresses Be
fore Fair Crowds
We last week published a portion of
the talk indulged in at the initial meet
ing of the democratic local candidates
in Buena Vista on Tuesday of last
week. A representative of the Ledger
was there for the purpose of taking
notes. It has been the practice of
some of the local orators of democracy
to pour out their pent— up vials of
wrath against the Ledger on such oc
casions, and we simply wanted to get
a line on the tunes to be sung for the
edification of the voters, but not be
cause we cared a snap for abuse usual
ly showered at such times. ; The
speakers, however, were not anxious
for publicity along the customary
path, and kept fairly within the limits
of legitimate discussion on this pro
position, however foolish the speakers
were in other respects.
On Friday night the same candidates
were at Pine Grove. Tne candidates
had started for the meeting place- be
fore the Ledger was issued, but the
papers reached the Grove by the regu
lar mail that evening. The Ledger
was never in such demand in the little
village as that evening. In a business
place the candidates were gathered,
with a number of residents of the
vicinity. They were divided into
several groups of half a dozen or so
each. Each group was excitedly por
ing over a copy of the Ledger, and
discussing its contents, the discussion
at times waxing vehement and stormy.
It was one of the must amusing scenes
witnessed in local politics for years.
The reporter for the Ledger was
present at the Pine Grove meeting, to
the amazement of the candidates.
Some of them seemed to think that it
was an ret of outrage for a local re
porter to dare to report their speeches
or to be present at all in a reportorial
capactiy. However, the speeches were
toned down in several respects from
the previous night. Some of the silly
stuff was cut out.
Gregory informed his hearers that
they would not need to bother them
selves for any other democratic candi
date for sheriff as long as he lived,
for, he tearfully sobbed, "I want to
stay with you forever, or until I die,
and then I want to be buried beneath

THE LOCAL CAMPAIGN.
Before the next issue of the Ledger, the election will have
passed into history, and the personnel of the state and county
governments will have been determined for the next four
years. To the people of Amador county the result of the
election for local offices is of more absorbing interest than the
contest for state offices. It concerns their every-day life, and
will affect them financially and otherwise at every stage of
affairs for the coming official term. The Ledger is not a hide
bound Republican paper. We have at various times declined
to support state and county candidates, on high moral
or political grounds, but never from mere personal motives.
We have no sympathy with that blind partisanship that
would " vote for the devil on one's own party ticket in pref
erence to a saint on the opposing ticket." That is placing
partyism above patriotism, whereas it should always be
subordinate to the fundamental principles of good govern
ment. Efficient and economical government cannot be ex
pected unless those charged with the administration of affairs
are honest, capable and devoted to the public weal. The
Ledger believes that a republican should not score his ticket
without good and sufficient cause for so doing. Even where
the rival candidates are deemed equal in the all the qualifica
tions of fitness, it behooves the party man to give the prefer
ence to the candidate of his own political faith. To this ex
tent only should party fealty govern in the selection of local
officers.
Now, the republican county ticket is made up of excep
tionally good material. Those candidates who are in office —
superior judge Fred V.Wood, school superintendent W. H,
Greenhalgh, and coroner and public administrator H. E.
Potter — are conceded to be as efficient officials in their respec
tive positions as the county has ever had. And not one of
them has yet served a full term. They are seeking indorse
ment at the hands of the voters by a reelection to the offices
they have so satisfactorily filled. Not one of them is tendering
apologies or excuses for official shortcomings. Their record
is an open and undefaced book. They ought to — and we
believe will — command the support of an overwhelming
majority of the voters of Amador county.
Of the new candidates we have first of all, John S. Davis,
nominee for sheriff. He is in the prime of manhood, physi
cally, mentally and temperamentally he impresses one as the
right man for the place. There is nothing of the bulldoser
or dictator in his .make-up, but at the same time a self-pos
session and firmness that are essential qualities in a sheriff.
There is W. G. Snyder, candidate for district attorney — an
office of vital moment to the welfare of the county. He has
been actively engaged in the practice of law in Jackson for
nearly four years. He commands the confidence and respect
of all who have entrusted business in his hands. He has
already reached a position as an able and reliable practitioner
of law. Without any disparagement of his more inexperi
enced opponent, voters will make no mistake in electing Mr.
Snyder as criminal prosecutor and legal adviser of this coun
ty. Jchn Marchant, candidate for assessor, Fred B. Le-Moin
for treasurer, and Antone L- Reale for county recorder, are
each running against the present democratic incumbent of
the respective offices. The Ledger is free to say as a matter
of simple iustice that it finds no fault with the conduct of
these offices under existing management. At the same time
the republican nominees are tried and true men, equally well
equipped for the faithful discharge of official duties. For
county surveyor, Gustave Schrader, republican nomiuee, is
an experienced surveyor and civil engineer. We can there
' fore, without auy mental reservation, stand by the republican
ticket straight down the line, and urge the members of the
party to do likewise.
We submit to the serious consideratiou of the voters the
fact that the sheriff and district attorney of Amador county
are now on a campaign tour, excusing and palliating the
non-col lectioti of county revenue. Both officials are charged
with the duty of seeiug that the income of the county is faith
fully collected. Aud yet they are telling the people that the
remission of back taxes and graining of free licenses for the
future to Ratto and Glenn— involving a loss of oversiooo
all told— was a commendable business policy. Isn't that a
pretty spectacle for citizens and taxpayers to ponder over.
Is it not high time, as a matter of self protection, to put an
end to this business, It is hard on the taxpayiug commun
ity to have to pay for the shortcomings of others, but to have
the favoritism indorsed is particularly displeasing.

That we die before 90 or 100, or
have disease, is mainly our own fault
we are told by a new work of Dr. A.
Loraud, of Carlsbad, who shews that
old age does not begin with failure of
the arteries, but with degeneration of
one or all of the ductless glands—es
pecially the liver, the kidneys, the
thyroid, or the ardenals. These glands
govern the process of metabolism and
nutrition of the tissues and remove the
poisonous products introduced with
food and air or formed as waste.
After their degeneration, the processes
of metabolism, or cell building and
destruction, are diminished, and there
is an increase of fibrous tissue at the
expense of the more highly developed
structures. Degeneration may result
from various causes. These include
the use of alcohol and tobacco in ex
cess, overwork and too little exercise,
and mental emotion, especially sorrow,
grief and anxiety. Following ordinary
hygienic rules lessens the burden on
these glands, tending to prevent pre
mature old age and early death.
Not least of the advantages claimed
for the telephoto camera of Vautier
and Schaer, ot Geneva, is its suit
ability for use on aeroplanes. The or
dinary long-distance camera, using a
combination of lenses, absorbs. . so
much light that single long-focus lens
in an ordinary camera would give the
apparatus too cumbersome a length.
In the new camera, the image of the
distant object is reflected by one
mirror to a second, and then to a
single long-focus lens. This makes it
possible to use a lens of 48 inches focus
in a length of 16 inches, and very bril
liant instantaneous views are obtained.
A novel household water system
without storage tanks has a rotary
pump, driven by electric motor, that
keeps the water in an air cylinder at a
certain pressure. Opening a faucet
lowers the pressure, turning the start
ing switch, and the pressure switches
off the motor at the fixed point.
Man is no longer growing -in mental
capacity, if the conclusions of a British
authority, Neville Chamberlain, are
correct. He makes a distinction be
tween intellect, pure and simple, and
the qualities that together make up
what is called character, and finds it
doubtful if the races often regarded as
inferior are at any disadvantage in
pure intellect. It is unfair to decide
mental capacity by comparing those
who have had the benefits of education
— giving the accumulated experience
of centuries— with semi-savages who
have been brought up in the bush.
Two generations ago the Japanese
were thought to be little better than
barbarians, of small intellect, and the
Babus of Bengal and the aborigines of
Australia were similarly regarded; but
now they take front rank in modern
universities, often exceling Europeans
at examinations. Move important to
average success than great intellectual
ability are the qualities constituting
character— such as courage, earnest
ness, determination, judgment and
sympathy. Even these traits must
be preserved and strengthened by the
same process of natural selection that
has so powerfully influenced physical
evolution, and the character ot the
individuals has made the character of
nations. Anglo-Saxon success, past
arid future, may be looked upon as a
result of national- character, rather
than any fancied intellectual superior
ity.
The serum treatment of mushroon
poisoning has been shown to be possi
ble by Radias and Sartory, French
physicians. An extract of the toxic
principle of two of the most dangerous
varieties of mushroons was made, and
injections of this virus were made into
rabbits in the usual manner for pre
paring antitoxin serums, such as those
of diptheria and rabies. After four
months' the rabbits were so completely
immunized that eating the most
poisonous mushroons had no effect.
In his determination of the tempera
ture of the whole earth, Dr. Fritmsche
used the records of 800 places, the
computed result being 14.6 deg. C. (58
deg. F.), with a variation of 4.2 deg.
C. The end of January is the coldest
period (12.5 deg C. ), and mid-July is
the warmest (16.7 deg. C. ) The mean
temperature of the northern hemis
phere is 15.3 deg. C, the southern be
ing about 15.3 dog. C. colder.
Heavy metals have been introduced
into glass by means of the electric
current by two German experimenters,
A. Heydweiller and F. Kopfermann.
A small tube of soda-glass or potash
glass, closed at the bottom, was filled
with a fused mixture of sodium and
potassium nitrates, and was immersed
in a fused salt of the heavy metal.

Current was applied through platinum
wire, the mixture within the tube
forming the cathode, or negative pole,
and the metallic salt outside serving
as anode. Sodium, potassium, barium,
strontium, lead, tin, copper, iron, co
balt and silver were thus introduced
into the glass electrolytically, but
with gold, platinum and uranium the
attempts were unsuccessful. The tem
peratures in the successful trials were
above 200 deg. C. The metaU pene
trate the glass in the colloidal form,
giving colors varying with conditions,
and on heating change to the metallic
state or to oxides. Some metals diffuse
to glass without the electric current,
though very much more slowly.
A curious system of "wireless tele
graphy" has been found among the
Indians of the Putumayo, a chief tribu
tary of the Upper Amazon. As des
cribed by W. E. Hardenburg, the ap
paratus consists of two logs of hard
wood with small holes burnt through
lengthwise by heated stones. The
thicker of the two logs gives out two
grave notes when struck, the thinner,
two acute notes. Hanging* from ronf
timbers, the logs are beaten with
rubber-tipped clubs, and signals are
sent by a code based on the difference
of tone and the length and number of
blows. In this way, messages are ex
changed to distances of seven to ten
miles. ;
. Kittens are not taught to kill mice,
but doi t instinctively, according to
the conclusions of two English obser
vers The instinct is aroused suddenly
by the movement of the mouse, first
appearing during the kitten's second
month of life, while still feeble and
scarcely able to eat a young mouse.
If not first aroused until two or three
months later, the instinct becomes less
and less quickly responsive, and the
practical inference is drawn that if a
kitten is to make a good mouser it
should be allowed to exercise its kil
ling instinct while very young.
CANNOT INJURE
JOHNSON'S CHANCES
The extent to which the "special
interests" will go in their efforts at
defamation of character in the interest
of the election of Theodore A. Bell is
shown by the totally unfounded charge
made in the San Francisco Post to the
effect that Hiram W. Johnson received
a fee of $55,000 for his services in de
fense of J. Dalzell Brown, paid in
stock of the Western Pacific. Herrin
and the representatives of other
"special interests" are trying to show
that the fight against the Southern
Pacific pol : tical domination which has
been made by Johnson almost ever
since he attained his majority, is due
to the fact of his ownership of Western
Pacific stock and his desire to enhance
the value of those securities.
It can be stated in the first place
that Hiram W. Johnson never received
a $55,000 fee from J. Dalzell Brown,
or from anyone else acting in Brown's
behalf, nor any sum at all approaching
that amount. As to the charge owner
ship of Western Pacific stock received
as a fee, Mr Johnson himself says:
"I never had, I never owned and I
never was interested in a single share
of Western Pacific stock, nor was I
ever, in any fashion, connected with
the Western Pacific, either as attorney
or otherwise. The story is absolutely
and unqualifiedly false, known to be
false, and published with the know
ledge of its falsity. It is simply part
of the cross conspiracy that is now on
in this state to win this election by
mendacity, slander and outrageous
villiflcation. It is exactly what I
warned the people about in my inter
view last Sunday and they may know
that more is to come."
The basis of this Btory printed ir: '.he
San Francisco Post was a speech l de
by Frank E. Hering at Berkeley on
Tuesday night, in which Heriug pu'. i a
series of questions, not making tie
charge directly, but intimating that as

the result of his investigation into the
affairs of the California Safe Deposit
& Trust Co., he had discovered this
condition.
Hering is the supreme organizer of
the Order of Eagles, an order in which
Bell also is a high officer. He was
brought out here from Indiana to do
politics for Bell among the members
of that order. As the rules of the
order forbid its use in politics, the
statement of Hering's official connec
tion has been carefully avoided, al
though, his position has by no means
been kept in the background. Hering
has been Bell'u close associate on the
stump.
When Bell started his campaign by
making personal attacks upon John
son's sincerity, his own position was
so plainly shown that he changed his
tactics and asserted that he depre
cated the use of personalities in the
campaign. Of course, Mr Bell no
longer wants personalities in the
campaign, because it was plainly
demonstrated that the personality in
which he indulged in was simply a
repetition of the statement of the San
Francisco Post, Now he ceases him
self, but he has his associates in the
campaign and his journalistic allies,
making a similar and even more men
dacious and personal assault.

which has been undertaken by the
Bell unquestionably will be continued
up to the end of the canvass. This
method of attack is familiar to every
one in San Francisco who has kept in
touch with the progress of the prose
cution of tne San Francisco grafters,
as the pet method of the men who
shamed San Francicso. The same in
terests are attached to the candidacy
of Theodore A. Bell and they are
using the same method to accomplish
the defeat of Hiram W. Johnson.

Mary C. Walton died in this town
October 29, aged 57 years, 7 months
and 12 days. She was born in Illinois
March 17, 1853. With her parents, Mr
and Mrs Henry Ellenburg, she crossed
the plains when only nine years of age,
and has resided in various parts of
California ever since. She was joined
in holy wedlock to John S.- Walton
September 26,1868. Of this union seven
children were born, one of whom died
in infancy. She is survived by a hus
band and the following children : John
E., Mark A, Henry J., Charles W., and
Ray L. Walton., and Mrs Frances W.
Rector, and six grand children. Dei
ceased also leaves an aged father and
mother, two sisters, and three brothers.
Mrs Walton was for many years and
up to the time of her death a faithful
member of the Chritsian church, and
her patient endurance of many weary
months of suffering bore silent testi
mony of the faith in which she died.
Mrs Walton's life in Plymouth as else
where has been characterized by a
careful consideration and unselfishness
demeanor toward all with whom she
3 came in contact, and in the same- life
' of noble purpose and unselfishness may
those who are left to- mourn her loss
pay a most loving tribute to her
memory.

RAKER ABUSES
ENGLEBRIGHT
Candidate for Congress
Grossly Misrepresents
Facts In Jackson
Last Saturday evening Jackson was
the scene of a democratic mass meet
ing, at which state senator, A. Cami
netti, nominee for member of state
senate from the 10th district, and
Judge John E. Raker, democratic
nominee for congress in the first dis
trict, were the principal speakers.
The Jackson band opened the meet
ing by playing several selections, after
which senator Caminetti was intro
duced from the steps of the National
hotel by Dr. E. E. Endicott, who
acted as chairman of the meeting.
He seemed to think everything was
positively certain as far as his own
election was concerned. For his com
panion judge Raker, however, he was
less ceitain, and therefore emptied his
gift of oratory upon the judge, who is
making a bitter campaign himself
against his opponent, congressman
Englebright. ■ ;■
Caminetti, after finding his voice
gone by reason of hoarseness, in
troduced judge Raker.
Raker attempted to be clever in his
opening remarks, by referring to his
own beauty, but toned down to solid
argument, and declared that he was
going to be the next congressman
from this district in spite of all his
obstacles.
The democrats and the insurgent
republicans will be able to control the
house, he declared, and I shall, when
ever 1 find it consistent, stand by the
insurgent forces.
He announced that he opposed
personal abuse, and personal criticism.
1 am making a daylight, noonday fight
myself, and I will conduct this cam
paign until the polls close on the Bth
of November along the same lines.
He stated that Englebright repeated
ly voted against labor, and decried and
attempted to belittle the present con
gressman in every manner possible.
Mr Raker confessed in his speech
that nearly every person in Humboldt
county informed him that owing to
the successful work of Knglebright in
securing the appropriation of over a
million of dollars, which had to be ex
pended in repairing and improving the
harbor of Eureka etc., that to a
jack man of them, as he expressed it,
would vote to return Englebright for
that act alone. With the aid of a
congressional record in which was
printed only the opening appropriation
of $150,000, he claimed that congress
man Englebright was misrepresenting
the matter, and deceiving his entire
district is the way he puts it. That
he carried positive proofs of what he
was telling. Then he exhibited the
copy of the congressional record and
read to his audience the appropriation
which he stated before was but $150,
000 which congress really passed upon
as the total amount for the work to
put the harbor of Eureka in a navi
gable condition.
After the meeting the Ledger's re
presentative interviewed the candidate
and showed him an editorial published
in a prominent Nevada county paper,
stating that over one million dollars
has been recommended. After read
ing the editorial, Raker turned to the
reporter and said, ' 'Well this paper is
misinformed, that's all." He was
then asked to deny or affirm the report
as being an editorial it was supposed
to carry with it an air of truthfulness
only. ... 9K
Well then, he'said, "I wish to in
form you that Mr Englebright is de
ceiving everyone that he tells that he
has secured the million dollar appro
priation for Humboldt county, or any
promise for that amount, that his only
appropriation is $150,000 which in it
self is insufficient to tow out and an
chor scows 'to start the work, and
there is nothing- whatever on record
that at any,., time congress will :ever
appropriate one more cent to carry on
the work.
Then he picked up his dress suit case
and took therefrom a large package of
papers and documents, which covered
the entire period of Mr Englebright's
experience in public life. I exhibit
these papers willingly he commented,
whenever I meet a man who is willing
to be convinced. . . . ;'
Starting at Englebright's
period as a public official, ;he ' pre
sented his record, declaring that the
present congressman had done nothing
commendable since his first election,
and intimating further, that he did
not have the abilities to qualify, for
the position he is holding.
The only purpose was to prejudice
the republican candidate, if possible,
in the minds .of some, and thereby
alienate votes, and help the democratic
candidate. The scheme was raw, but
the monumental mendacity of the
speaker staggered us. We took the
opportunity to call up Congressman
Englebright by telephone when at
Sonora, and asked him about some of
the statements made by Raker, es
pecially the charge of deceiving the ]
people of Ilumboldt county by telling :
them of a million dollar appropriation,
when in fact only $150,0o0 was
granted. Mr Englebright informed
us that the engineers sent out by the
government to investigate conditions,
reported to congress that it would
take 81,037,000 to make the improve
ments contemplated. On this basis
the sum of $150,000, was voted at the
last session as a starter of this great
work— the estimated cost of one year's
work. It is merely the beginning and
not the end of the matter, as the un
scrupulous Raker wished to make the
people believe. Other appropriations
will be made as needed.
Judge Raker has been making the
same kind of shameless misrepresenta
tions in other places. The Placer Re
publican takes him to task severely
for his low down tactics. It says :
Mr Raker stated that his opponent
had deceived the people of Humboldt
county into the belief that he had
securei an appropriation of 81,037,000
for harbor improvements at Eureka
and that he (Raker) has "astounded"
the people of that county by proving
that only $105,000 had been appro
priated. As a matter of fact Mr
Englebright in his speeches in Hum
boldt county and interviews printed in
Eureka papers has fully expiuined this
matter. He has qhown that he has
obtained an appropriation of $150,000
to cover one year's work. The plan!)
providing for the improvement of the
bar call for an expenditure of $1,
037,000 and this will be available as
the work progresses. The people of
Humboldt county will give Mr Engle
brigiit an overwhelming majority
November 8. •".•'
Judge Raker expressed himself in
favor of an eight-hour law. The only
time the eight-hour law has come up
in congress while Mr Englebright
was a member was at the last ses
sion, when it was made to apply to
government vessels built by contract.
It was a hot fight to get the bill
passed and Mr Englebright voted for
it. He is in favor of extending the
law to all branches, which congress
has the power to regulate.
Mr Raker stated that Congressman
Englebright had done nothing to im
prove the navigation of the Sacra
mento river. Our congressman has
obtained an authorization for a sur
vey of this river from the mouth of
the Feather river to Red Bluff. The
report of the board of engineers made
upon that authorization is now before
the board of reviews. The reports
recommends a sufficient expenditure
from Sacramento to Colusa for a four
foot channel, $32,000 for a four-foot
channel from Colusa to Chjco landing
and $6,000 a year | from Chico landing
to Red Bluff for a three foot channel
for a part of the year. He has also
favored an appropriation of $400,000
for the improvement of the Sacramen
to river.
Mr Raker favored diverting a por
tion of the Sacramento river for ir
rigation purposes, but did not state
how he was going to get the many
millions of dollars necessary to carry
out the work.
Mr Englebnght is not opposed to
conservation as claimed by Judge
Raker. Mr Englebright believes in
maintaining national forests with pro
per boundaries and J under qualified
management. One of the first bills
Mr Englebright introduced in congress
was to increase the percentage of the
receipts from the national forests, to
be paid to the several conuties in
which they are situated, for tne bene
fit of the road and school funds, and
such an increase to 25 per cent was
made.
Jugde Raker informed his audience
that Congressman Englebright had
done nothing for the mining industry
of the state. He was chairman of the
subcommittee on mines and mining,
which prepared the mining bureau bill,
and he helped to pass it. The mining
bureau is in active operation and is
making investigations that will be of
great service to the miners— to pre
vent mining accidents and protect
health and lives of the miners. An
important matter was the withdrawal
bill which he helped to get amended to
give miners and prospectors the right
to make their locations on veins or
lodes within the area withdrawn.
I The miner and prospector has a
champion in Mr Englebright. and he
successfully made a tight so that any
public land in the state can now. be
located and patented within or with
out the forest reserves for the metal-i,"
ferous minenls and the miner can
have the free use of timber on ''his
claim to be used in working it.
Here are a few more things for the
information of Judge Kaker: Con
gressman Englebright voted for the
postal savngs bank bill. As a member
of the naval committee he succeeded
in having included in the naval bill an
item providing for the construction of
submarine torpedo boats to be built on
the Pacific coast and saved from de
feat the appropriation for the con
struction of a collier at the Mare Is
land navy yards. He favored and
voted for the many measures passed
.in favor of the working classes, the
employers' liability bill, the sixteen
hour bill for trainmen, the bills pro
viding for safety devices to protect the
lives of trainmen.
Mr Englebright worked faithfully
for the bond issue of $20,000,000 to put
the reclamation service on an entirely
new basis, so that practical assistance
can be expected in the construction of
irrigation works ; in ' California in the
future. "• " -' ' • "-'
And yet Judge Kaker could find noth
ing Mr ttnglebright had done for the
people of his district and state !
While it may be admitted that Judge
Raker is a fluent talker, with a strong
voice, his speech was too radical
to command respect. A more audacious
attack upon a congressman, evidently
prompted by an overpowering desire to
go to Washington, has never been
heard in Amador county. Raker
surely raked his opponent fore and
aft, and if his statements were even
half true, they would tend to lower
our very able and active congressman
in the estimation of his constituents,
But his speech was a tissue of misre

presentation. And how one holding
the office of judge could indulge there
in passes our comprehension.
According to Judge Raker, congress
man Englebright had .voted against
labor bills, had done nothing for the
benefit of his district. His speech
was a diatribe against the present in
cumbent, intended only to create a
prejudice. He had accomplished noth
ing for the mining interests, nor tor
the improvement of the Sacramento
river. In fact, his remarks tended to
create the impression that Englebright
was lacking in all the essentials of a
member of congress, and should there
fore be displaced and himself substi
tuted.

Children Cry
FOR FLETCHER'S
OASTO RIA
NOISE THAT HURTS
In last week's issue of the Ledger
it was stated that in August primary,
Judge Wood received 66 votes to 39 for
Mr Role in the home precinct of Mr
Bole in Jackson. This was an error
for the vote was Wood 84 and Bole 39.
No attention would have been paid to
this error had it not been called to our
attention that certain friqnds of Mr
Bole have claimed that in the election
in Contra Costa, the only place that
Judge Wood carried was his home town
of Alamo, by a vote of 39 to 9.
This is not true, for Judge Wood car
ried the city of Richmond by 270 ma
jority. He also had majorities in
Stege, Oakley, Walnut Creek, Lafay
ette, Tajassaia, San Ramon and Her
cules. Furthermore it is well known
to the writer of the Dispatch that the
cause of Judge Wood's defeat was a
bitter factional fight in the Republican
party for tne nomination of judge,
which lasted for four months, and that
the republican party in Contra Costa
has been for years torn asunder by
factional fighting. Four year 3 ago
sheriff Veale of Contra Costa county,
with a state wide reputation for his
efficiency as a sheriff and with a strong
democratic following in the county
was elected by the narrow margin of
198 majority, running 1503 behind the
Roosevelt vote, because of the faction
al fighting. To try and make capital
over a candidate's pulitical defeat is an
absurdity, for every man in public life
has met it at some pe-tiod [.of his po
litical career. The Ledger would not
have called attention to the vote of Mr
Bole in his home precinct had his
friends not endeavoied to make capital
of Judge Wood's defeat in Contra
Costa. So we invited attention to vote
received by Judge Wood in his home
town and that received by Mr Bole iv
his home precinct.

Flying False Colors?
A. G. Briggs, manager of the Pacific
Motor Publishng Co. of San Francisco
came to Jackson in company with John
E, Raker, democratic candidate for
congress. He is endeavoring to help
along the aspirant tor congress in
every wav he can, although advocating
the good roads proposition by a radical
chaiige in the law, which will make
the county suveyor the superintendent
of roads, and responsible for all work
done on the public highways. He is
deeply interested in good roads, as his
business, the automobile trade—de
pends upon efficient road making. He
thinks by concentrating the respon
sibility of road repairs upon one
elective official, a much better return
for the money expended will be
secured. It is probable that a bill will
be introduced into the legislature at
the next session for the purpose of
carrying into effect this mucn needed
reform— doing away with supervisor
control of roads.

Many Halloween
Pranks are Unjust
Halloween was observed on Monday
night lust by many of Jackson's
yojnger folks, und pranks were
played on the unwary.
About 7 o'clock a procession of
about eight or ten youngsters nil
wrapped in sheets and wearing white
masks, filed into Main street from
Court street and feared all the dogs
and horses on the thoroughfare. They
tramped single file down to the
National hotel, and then counter
marched. They then started a series
of pranks that will no doubt take
weeks to unravel.
Joe Vigna, who is janitor at the
Jackson grammar school, forgetful
of his last year's deal, was on hand,
and had the building all in readiness
to receive the pupils for the day's
session, and at the regular time at
which the first bell was to ring he
proceeded to pull the bell rope, but
curfew refused to respond. After tug
ging frantically on the rope without
response, he hastened into the belfry
and there found that one of the gob
lins had removed the bell clapper. He
then began a scramper to find the
clapper in order to be in time with his
ringing, but no clapper was found,
and as a result no school bell rung
that day.
The board of trustees were notifk-d,
and a new clapper was ordered, which
will be riveted into position, so that
those who attempt to steal it again
will have quite a task to perform.
Much destruction was done by the
more thoughtless class of youths who
were out for the nights rampage.
Gates were torn from their hinges,
flower pots holding valuable plants
senc crashing across lawns, and car
riage wheels of every description,
more or less damaged.

quite a hit at Sutter Creek, where a

John Batchelder, one rf the pioneers
of ilhis section, died at the residence
of his son, J. E. Batchelder, in Jack
son, on Saturday last, after an illness
of about nine days. About a week
before the end, while engaged in some
ilight work about his home near Butte
mountain, he was taken ill believed *o
have been the result of the rupture erf
a blood-vesssl in the brain. He was
removed to his son's home in Jacksan,
where he could receive the necessary
care and attention, as his wife is too
old and feeble to give him the needed
care. He tooJc to his bed at once, land
was ' never thereafter able to rise
therefrom. He gradually sank dnto
unconsciousness, and passed avvsjy in
that condition. The funeral was held
last Monday, the Rev. J. O. Duncan
officiating, :*nd the remains were in
terred in the city cemetery. Many of
the pioneers who had known him from
early days gathered to pay the final
tribute of respect to his memory.

THIS IS CERTAIN.
The Proof That Jackson Readers
Cannot Deny.
What could turnish stronger evi
■dence of the efficiency of any remedy
than the test of time? Thousands of
people testify that Doan's Kidney
Pills cure permanently.
Home endorsement should prove un
doubtedly the merit of this remedy.
Years ago yoni 1 friends and neigbhors
testified to the relief they had derived
from the use of Doan's Kidney Pills.
They now confirm their testimonials.
They say time has completed the test.
Mrs James Cook, 25 Water street,
Jackson Cal., says : ' ' For a long
time I was afflicted with kidney com
plaint and my health became all run
down. My back ached continually and
I was subject to headaches and dizzy
spells. The contents of the first box
of Doan's Kidney Pills, procured at
the City Pharmacy, worked wonders,
and after I had used four boxes of this
remedy, rry trouble was a thing of
the past. lam only too glad to en
dorse Doan's Kidney Pills." (State
ment given in July 1907. )
GOOD WOKK.
Mrs Oook was interviewed on April
5, 191Q, and she added to the above :
"I have nothing to retract trom the
statement 1 gave in praise of Doan's
Kidney Pills in 1909. My cure has
been permanent, and thus my faith in
this remedy has increased."

To this formidable array of cash that
has left the county treasury for the
Docket of U S Gregory during his 14
years of office holding as sheriff, must
be added «>ther sources of income from
this fat position. He gets s?5 a day and
expenses for conveying prisoners and
insane persons to state institutions,
also fet-s for serving processes sent
from other counties' and commissions
in insolvency or assignee sales. We
again assert that total receipts
for official sources for 14 years will
overtop 8100,000. Isn't that about
enough for one man. Surely the needy
cry is not in order in this case.

of Jackson, followed with brief but
pointed addresses, in which they
pointed out the benefits to be derived
from such an institution, as seen from
the view point of the church and the
business man. A large Dus-loacl of

good representation was also present
from Sutter Creek On the platform
were John (iallori. John Grillo and P.

Passes Away
Mr 3 Evelina P. Rust, the venerable
mother or Edwin C. Rust, business
manager of the index, passed away at
12:30 o'clock this morning at the ad
vanced age of 94 years. The funeral
will take place from St. Paul's Epis
copal church at 1 ;30 o'clock Thursday
afternoon.
The death of Mrs Rust removes
from the stage of life one of the
pioneer mothers of California, who in
the most strenuous days of the history
of the state was a model wife and
mother and the friend and counsellor
of many a young man far away from
home and kindred. She was an exem
plification of the Christian virtues
that make the life beautiful, and her
end was peace.
Bor;- in Whiting, Vt, on Aug. 7,
1816. she was married to Richard Rust
at Suibury in the same state on. Aug.
15,i834. Soon afterward they moved
to Louisiana, where they resided until
1849. In this memorable year Mr
Rust was appointed secretary of the
United States boundary commission
and they came to California via the
Panama isthmus, arriving in San
Diego on July 13, 1849. Her husband,
her family and herself have made their
home in this state ever since.
Mrs Rust was the mother of five
children, two daughters who died in
infancy, and three sons, the late Judge
Richard Rust of Amador county, the
late Edgar C. Rust and Edwin C. Ru?t
of this city, who survives her. She
has made her home with her son's
family here for the last two years and
her declining days have been brightened
by the care and affection shown her.
She was a devout member of the Epis
copal church, having been confirmed
in that faith in Louisiana in 1836. She
has many friends throughout the state
who will hold her in loving remem
brance.—Salinas Index.

FARMERS STRONG
FOR EXPOSITION TAX
State Grange Adopts Resolu
tions Favoring Proposed
Amendments
The farmers of California are en
thusiastic supporters of the proposed
Panama-Pacific Exposition to beheld
In San Francisco In 1915 and they are
practically unanimous in favor of tho
proposition to tax the State and bond
San Francisco to add $10,000,000 to
tho Exposition fund.
The California State Orange, at its
meeting in Napa on October 6th,
adopted the following resolutions:
Whereas, There hns been submitted
to the people* of the State of Califor
nia two proposals for amendment to
the Constitution of the State; and
Whereas, '- -These measures, if ap
proved, will enable the people of San
Francisco to raise by taxation $5,000,
000 for the Panama-Pacific Interna
tional Exposition, and will provide
for a State tax adding another $5,000,
000 to the Exposition fund; and
Whereas, We, as farmers and pro
ducers, realize the vital necessity of
supporting and encouraging the efforts
of the men who are. bending every
energy to tho successful consumma
tion of the plan to place before the
world the wonderful resources of the
Pacific Coast; therefore, be it
Resolved. That we,' the members of
the California State Grange, do here
by express our belief that the best
interests of California will be served
by favoring these measures. We are
of the opinion that the effect of the
Panama-Pacific International Exposi
tion will be to larsely aid in the de
velopment of the State and her re
sources;
Resolved,* That a copy of this reso
lution be sent to each subordinate
Grange in the State, and to each In
dividual member;
Resolved, That the Secretary of
this organization be instructed to for
ward each subordinate Grange in Cal
ifornia such printed matter as will
call the attention of the people to the
Importance of these measures.
EDITORS FOR EXPOSITION TAX
Members of California Press Associa*
tion Will Work for Amendments.
The California Press Association
has unanimously and unqualifiedly
endorsed the San Francisco Panama-
Pacific Exposition project. Seventy
five members of the Association, all
prominent newspaper editors and
managers, held a three days' confer
ence in San Francisco October 7, 8
and 9, and after, a thorough discussion
of the subject, pledged themselves to
work for the passage of the two pro
posed constitutional amendments by
which $10,000,000 will be added to the
Exposition fund.
The resolutions adopted contain the
following paragraph having particular
reference to the State tax:
"This convention heartily endorses
the State tax on $5,000,000 to be de
voted to the funds of an International
Exposition to be held in San Francisco
in 1915."
ODD FELLOWS
ENDORSE EXPOSITION
The Grand Encampment, I. O. O. F.,
at its annual session at Santa Ana,
on October 7, unanimously adopted
the following resolution endorsing the
Panama-Pacific Exposition at San
Francisco in 1915:
Resolved, That the Grand Encamp
ment heartily endorses and approves
the holding of the Panama-Pacific Ex
position in California in 1915, and re
quests its members, individually and
collectively, to use their best efforts
and influence. in local, State and Na
tional matters that shall culminate in
assembling not only the people of our
own Republic, but the nations of the
world, in our Golden State at the
completion of this great enterprise.
AN ENORMOUS PLEDGE.
Commenting editorially on the ac
tion of the legislature in paving the
way to add $10,000,000 to the San
Francisco Panama-Pacific Exposition
fund the Healdaburg Enterprise says:
"It is recognized that the exposition
would be of great benefit to the whole
coast if only from an advertising point
of view. In order that the United
States government may take official
notice of the fair it is necessary that
these bonds be voted. This $10,000,
000 together with the $7,500,000 al
ready subscribed by San Francisco
will enable California to go to the
opening of the session and offer the
United States an enormous pledge
that it is able to finance and conduct
an exposition that will be a credit to
the nation."
THE LOGICAL PLACE.
That San Francisco is the logical
place to bold the world's fair In 1915
could not be denied by even the fair
eat minded people of New Orleans.
There Is no harbor to New Orleans;
It Is Inland 100 miles, on a river, but
no place to invite the navies of the
world, and that will be half a show of
Itself. It Is to celebrate the bringing
ocean to ocean together, and with the
finest harbor In tho world San Fran
cisco is eutitled to it. Let's boost

was to be congratulated upon his ap
pointment, and that he would be wil
ling to practice before him the re
mainder of his life. Mr Bole has had
no cases before Judge Wood since !he
became a candidate, and yet under
the guise of a communication from
Sutter Creek to promote his candi
dacy, he permits the publication of
an article reflecting upon the honor
and motives of Judge Wood for his de
cision in a case in which Mr Bole was
an attorney.-
An attorney who would endeavor to
elevate himself to the bench by taking
advantage of attacks upon the court
would certainly not elevate the court
by his occupacy of that bench.

was engaged In farming in his native
state, until 1847, when he moved to
New Bedford, Mass., and there em

with the gold fever which was then
sweeping around the world incident to
the discovery of gold in California. He

state in the spring of 1850. He joined
a United States expedition organized
in Monterey to subdue the Indians in
in the Four Creeks country, as it was
then called, and which is now com
prised in the counties of Kern and
Tulare. The expedition, after accom
plishing its object, crossed over the
mountains into the San Joaquin valley
to Benecia, and disbanded in the fall'
of the same year. After a few
months he started for Jackson, arriv
ing here in May, 1851, and proceeded
at once to Clinton, where lie followed
mining and vegetable raising until
1853, when he moved to a ranch one
mile east of Jackson, and engaged' in
farming up to the time of his death;
In 1865 he was united in marriage to
Mrs Maria Thompson, 'nee Eakin. One
son "and one daughter were born of
this union, both of whom survive ; J.
E. Batchelder of Jackson, and Mrs
Rose Dabadie of Altaville, Calaveras

Deafness Caa not 08 Cored
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear
There is only one way to cure deafnees
and that Is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous "lining of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can oe
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are paused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars
or any case of Deafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free.
