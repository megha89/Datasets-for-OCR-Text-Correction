The. Origin of Starrhinfc.
The course of history carries >is'b;:cli
no further than the year l") 04 for 7 tho
origin of starching in London. It wsi.»
in that year that Mistress Van Opt
Plasse came with her husband" freni
Flanders to the English metropolis "fqv
their greater safety" , and there ■ pr<"; :
fessed herself a starcher. The .be". l
housewives of the time were not Ion;
in discovering the excellent whitcnesV
of the "Dutch linen," as it was on Neil,
and Mistress Plasse soon had plenty of
good paying clients. Some of these be
gan to send her ruffs of lawn to starch.
which she did so excellently well tlia<
it became a saying that If any one sent
her a ruff made of a spider's l web sh;
would be able to starch it. So RiViidy
did her reputation grow tlmt fnsliiorm
ble dames went to her to learn the art
and mystery of starching, for which
they gladly paid a premium of £4 or £•">.
and for the secret of seething, stnrcli
they, paid gladly a further suni of 2o
shillings..

THE FIERY DRAGON.
Ancient and Mediaeval Descriptions
of the Monster.
Dragons were important animals In
ancient* and mediaeval natural history.
Until comparatively recent time no
scientist ever thought of questioning
the existence of this most formidable
of beasts. The annals of Winchester
for 1177 gravely state that "in this year
dragons were seen of { many in j Eng
land." Gesner, prof essor? of natural
history at Zurich, gives a detailed de
scription of the dragon, while Aldro
vandus, in his "History" of Serpents
and Dragons," published in IC4O, de
votes fifty pages to the monster. - A
good specimen of a dragon would seem
to have been a beast about the size of
a sheep, incased in a .coat of scales
which shone like silver. Its back was
serrated like a saw. ;■ It possessed - a
long tail, a pair of batlike wings, four
heavily clawed feet and a wolvlne head,
the -Jaws . of \ which 'were armed with
very formidable teeth. The tongue
was barbed with fire, and fury Issued
from the monster's mouth, and the head
bore a crest ' Dragons were the most
wicked ' and? vindictive of creatures.
They seem always to have been in ' a
towering rage and spent | the greater
portion of their time In rushing up and
down the earth destroying everything
that came in their path. The origin of
dragons ..was a j disputed * point | among
mediaeval naturalists. Some maintain
ed that these animals were generated
by the heat of India; others were of
opinion that the volcanoes of Ethiopia
used to belch forth the monsters. One
scientist, John Leo by name, declared
the dragon to be a, hybrid, a cross"be
tween an eagle and a wolf.
MODESTY OF THE~GRE AT.
Gladstone and Darwin Felt, Thenv
selves "Ordinary Persons."
In "Studies In Contemporary Biogra
phy," by James Bryce, there occur two
itories which caused some of the critics
to express astonishment at the "mod
esty of the great." The stories are
these: :J>^:; . ■ : . : •-. '
■ "Meeting Mr. Gladstone in the lobby
and seeing his -face saddened by the
troubles in Ireland, Mr. Bryce tried to
Sivort. his 'thoughts by mentioning a
recent" discovery— to wit that Dante
had been saved from want in his last
years' by a lectureship at Ravenna. Mr.
Gladstone's face lit up at once,, and he
gaid, .'How; strange It is to think that
these great "souls, whose works are a
beacon light to all the generations that
have come after them, should have" had.
rares and anxieties to vex them in their
daily life Just like the'rest of us com
mon mortals!' - :
"The words reminded me," adds the
author, "that a few days before I had
heard Mr." Darwin, in dwelling upon
the pleasure a visit paid by Mr. Glad
stone had given him, say, 'And he talk
ed just as if he had been an ordinary
person like one of ourselves.' The two
men were alike unconscious of their
greatness." ;/T : ;^*; :
It is only the little who think them
selves great. They are like those who
do not know much and therefore im
agine that there is not much to know.
The great do not think themselves so,
Just as the learned are overwhelmed by
their ignorance.
Grace In Old Forests.
Some trees are more, graceful- than
others.' j The elm and oak art- noted for
their perfect and graceful form. "All
their branches appear to be perpetually
moving, stirred by every wind that
blows, and the same may be snid jof
the pine. The graceful movements of
its limbs, the sighing sounds of "its
stems and evergreen needles, send forth
a solemn symphony. Everything con
tributes serene grace and simplicity to
old forests.
The Dictionary.
■ "Neither is a dictionary a bad book
to read," says Emerson in his essay on
books. "There is no cant In it, no ex
cess of explanation, and it is full of
Suggestion, the raw material of possi
ble poems and histories. Nothing; is
wanting but a little shuffling, sorting,
ligature and cartilage."
Impressive.
"Why did we arrive late and leave
before the opera was over?" asked ibe
youngest daughter. "It was very "en
joyable." • ;:>'£- ,f|
"Of course it was," answered Mrs.
Newrlch, "but, my dear, we had to
show people that we didn't care wheth
er we got our moneys worth or not."

A POET'S ALOOFNESS.
The Manner Iv Which Words wortV
Wm Regarded by His Neighbors.
;,,The worthies of .Wordsworth's fvil
lage in the lake ■ country • of • England
had their own ideas of his value as a
man ; and a poet , .When questioned
after .his death as to ; his personality
they readily admitted that he was kind
to those who were in sickness or need.'
They could count on him on a pinch.
But he did not hobnob with his neigh

in old man iv answer to questions

Was his rig," continued the old hian.
"And as for his habits, "■ he had noan.
Niver knew him with "a pot i' his hand
er a pipe i' his, mouth."
After deep probing the author brought
out: .
. " "Yes; Wordsworth was fond •of ' a
good dinner at times if you could Ret
him to it. That was the job."
Then the poet's aloofness was again
touched upon.
"He was forever pacing the roads
and Ills own garden walks and always
composing poetry. He was ter'blc
throng in visitors and folks ye man
ken at times, but if he could get awa'
fra . them a spell he was out upon his

From the mountains of Camden, Me.,
comes a story of a Philadelphia mer
chant who has a summer cottage in
that village and who wished to ex
change a lively horse which he owned
with a French Canadian who had a
more gentle animal, which women and
children could drive. ; The Frenchman
was willing to trade, but for some rea
son insisted upon repeating to the vis
itor that the local horse did not "look"
as well as the one belonging to the
Philadelphia man.
,An exchange satisfactory to both
parties was eventually made, and the
first time the visitor's wife took the
new horse out for a drive she discov
ered that the. beast was as blind as a
mole. ' A few days later, when the rus
tlcator met the Frenchman, he said: '-■•-
"See here, you rascal! That horse
you swapped with me for mine was
stone blind. Why didn't y6u tell me
of it at the time?"

[ The customer walked out of the store
and the clerk turned to a friend.
"That means cigar money for me," h«
said, "and I smoke good cigars at that
In most stores it wouldn't do me very
much good, as all the discarded hats
are given to the drivers of the delivery

we make a little extra money. :Aboul: Aboul

Treea Shaped by tbe Wind.
The effect of wind upon trees is pow
erful. Even the presence or absence
of forests may be determined by the
character of the prevailing wind or the
conditions that modify it. The wind
acts asa drying agent, giving a special
aspect to many plants. When it is al
most always from the same quarter
the plants show greater development
upon one side. Trees, are smaller on
the windward edges of forests, and
trunks and branches are bent to lee
ward. The deformations are most mark
ed near the sea or in flat regions. The
cherry, plum, walnut, black poplar,
ash and certain pines are very sensi
tive to the wind, but mountain pines
Bnd certain firs offer great powers of
resistance, and these are recommended
for reforesting wind swept lands.

AN OLD CHURCH BELL
»T CAME FROM LISBON; AND HANGS
" IN A NANTUCKET CHURCH.
The Story of Its Purchase by Captain'
Claaby and Its Transportation to
I- This Country— A Very Good j Clock
and . a Very Fine Bell.
,\ Beneath the outlook in a Nantuckct
thurch is the belfry, in which swings
the "old Spanish bell.''" Knowing" that
tills is now a Unitarian church, the vis
itor will be surprised to see a Catholic
cross on the bell. Jlf he could read Por
tuguese and had not previously ac
quainted 1 himself with the history ; of
the 1 bell he would be . still more sur
prised at the ' inscription 'on . it' -'■ | The
translation of this Inscription is as fol
lows: "To the Good Jesus of the Moun
tain the. devotees of Lisbon direct their
iwayers, offering Him one complete set
of six bells, to call the people to adore
him in' his sanctuary. Jose Domlngos
Dacosta has made it in Lisbon In tho
year 1810." Of course the bell r must
have an interesting history. to account
for. this inscription. That history is
briefly as follows: -
A plague "was raging in Lisbon and
certain : people in that city . prayed to
the , Virgin Mary for the cessation of
the plague and vowed to place a set of
six bells in the Church of the Good
Jesus of the Mountain If their prayers
were heard. "The Mountain" is the
name of a certain district in the. city
of Lisbon in which there is a very ven
erable church called as above. Shortly
after, this the plague ceased, and, ac
cepting this ' as the answer '; to their
prayers, these devotees of Lisbon pro
ceeded to fulfill their vows. The work
of casting these six bells was Intrusted
to Jose Domingos Dacosta, the best
bell founder In Lisbon.
. The six bells had been cast, the mas
ter's labors had . been crowned with
success, when Captain Clasby of , the
Nantucket -whaling fleet chanced to
visit Lisbon. . He had long wished to
buy. a bell for use in his native town?
In company with Captain Cary .he
visited the bell foundry of ' Jose : Do
• mingos * Dacosta. Captain . Cary, -it
seems, was a connoisseur in bells. 7 Da
costa applied the lever to one bell after
another as he struck each to ascertain
its peculiar tone or tone quality, but
each- time Captain Cary said, "That
.will not do." .
At last Dacosta raised and struck
the bell whose history. we are describ
' ing. Captain Cary was delighted with
the result "Ah, Olasby," he ' said,
"you need look no further. That's the
bell you want. She is a beauty. She
sounds on B." '.
"Well," sir," remarked Dacosta, "we
consider that to be the finest bell that
we have in our foundry." ■ .
At first Dacosta demurred and could
not see his way clear to selling the
bell, since It belonged to the set of
.chimes designed for. the Church of the
Good Jesus of the Mountain and was
appropriately inscribed and all, but
Captain Clasby would have no other.
Finally Dacosta decided, since the bell
had not yet been consecrated and since
he could cast another to take its place,
that it would be all right to sell." .
So Captain Clasby bought the bell,
and: it was brought to Nantucket by
Captain Cary, whose vessel was going
home' first In Lisbon,'. Just before he
set sail. Captain Cary heard of the dec
laration of. war with Great Britain,
for It was now the year 1812. On the
way over they were spoken by a Brit
ish sloop of war. Fortunately the Brit
isher had been at sea for some time
and had not yet beard of the declara
tion of war. "The commander asked
Captain Cary the news, but Captain
Cary says he took especial pains not
to tell all he knew. If he had told, our
precious bell would probably never
have seen Nantucket It might now be
either at the bottom of the sea or it
might.be swinging in the tower of
some English church.
The bell : was landed in Nantucket
and placed in the store cellar, of Sam
uel Cary, where it remained until 1815,
when it was purchased and placed in
the tower where it now hangs. About
$500 was given for the bell — the society
paid about $350 and the rest was raised
by subscription. Even some Friends
or Quakers subscribed.
After the bell had been in use a little
while the agents of the historic . Old
South church in Boston heard of It, and
they sent a letter to the agents of the
South church in Nantucket, saying that
they had a very good clock in their
tower,., but no bell; that they had heard
that the South j church in Nantucket
had a very fine bell, and they would
like to know for how much the bell
could be bought
The* Nantucketers replied that they
had a very fine bell In their tower, but
no clock; that they had heard that the
Old South church had a very fine tower
clock, and that they would like to
know the- price of the clock. )
. ' The agents offered to pay $1 a pound
for the bell. Since the bell weighs
1,575 pounds, this would have made
the price $1,575, making & net profit of
?1,075 above the price paid for the bell
and $1,225 above the amount contrib
uted by the society. It seems that the
old Nantucketers must have had some
sentiment after all and were not purely
mercantile in their spirit.
If the Nantucketers had agreed to
Bell, as they might have done, our bell
would probably be hanging In the his
toric tower of Old South church in
Boston today. That might have been
a great honor for the bell, but it would
have been a great deprivation for Nan
tucket. Moreover, it would now be
spending Its time in elegant leisure in
stead of being a very useful bell where
It Is. The history of this bell is like a
veritable parable of human life. The
possibilities which occur in the history
of the bell remind us of the possibilities
which abound in every life. — Cor.

A WHISTLER STORY.
frhe Climax of a Dinner In Honor «. '
the Eccentric Artisl.
At the, close" of the "case of WbistW
against , Ruskin,- the v former, findin';:
himself very much iri need of rest an<l
recreation, decided to make n. southern"
trip. -When he arrived in'; Venice; his
American friend thought to cheer ( him
by giving .a little dinner in? his honor,
to which ; were J bidden several friend?
_of -tlie; artist, principally ."Anioricanj
and ; some few Italians. ' During ' the
meal " there ; arose a j discussion which
left lon opening ; for Mr/ Whistler >to
use ' upon his host one of ; those ; keen,
incisive, verbal thrusts peculiar to him,
which left wounds "extremely.: difficult
to / heal. ■ ; . The whole ;. company ; ; was
startled, but , the host i merely v smiled,
seeming to notice only the brilliancy of
the ; attack: Presently t ! S .howeVer, the
dinner came to an end -and the foreign
guests toolc their leave, k Then the host
turned ; upon. Mr). Whistler;' and, r ; in a
Foiee trembling with suppressed anger,
said: : • V
' "Jlmmie, do you know that you bru
tally insulted me tonight?". '
"Yes," replied the artist thoughtf»UjJ
"Well," continued . the host, "I held
my temper while there were others
than our own countrymen present,; but
do you know what I shall do if ever
you speak to me like that again?"
"What?" :i;^<H":-^; > > :V ' >
"I'll grab the nearest water bottle
and smash it over your head.".
; The rest of the company sat qulfe
still, horror and dismay in their hearts,
while their angry host glared across
the table at his antagonist. After ! a
few seconds Mr. Whistler said in a tone
of childlike Innocence:
"Then I know what I'll do! I'll never
say anything like that to you again."—

Looking Under the Hat.
You seldom will find a brainy man
with ar ound head. ,' The ; head that
contains lots lof brains either Is very
long from , front ; to back ;or ■ else f ir
regular. You can . learn something of
a man's mental ability by the hat he
wears. \ It his head is so bumpy, that
it seems as if he never could get a hat
to fit him he probably. is a genius! or
a crack-a-Jack in some particular line.
If his head is long from front to back
he is a clear thinker and smart as a
whip, j So if your hat costs more mon
ey than your friend's hat does and
you are harder to fit be consoled ;by
considering that your ■ brain is worth
more.— New York Press. 4 S^Pif^-JS
Peebles.
: In the "Memoir" of Robert Chambers
by his brother. William is a delightful
allusion to Peebles, their birthplace and
a spot ever warm in the loving mem
ory of Scotch residents.
One of these, a man who had lived
there all his life, was enabled by some
uplift of fortune to visit Paris. When
he came back his townsmen gravely
gathered about him.-
"Noo," said one, while the others lis
tened, "tell us aboot It" ,
"Paris,", he began, "a' things consid
ered, is a wonderfu' place; but, still,
Peebles for pleasure."
The Thumb.
Thumbs have been appreciated over
since the world began. The ancients
used to call the thumb the other band.
Barbarous kings used to swear and
make compacts' by their thumbs. • 'In
Rome it was a sign of favor to wring
and kiss the thumb and of disfavor
or disgrace to lift it up or turn it out
ward. A man who was hurt in his
thumbs was excused from serving in
the Roman wars. Some of the scoun
drelly citizens used to cut off their
thumbs so as to remain at home and
get rich. Teachers used to punish their
pupils by biting their thumbs.

FOOTBALL.
tThe Old ; Fashioned '„ School Game
Wherein Everybody Played.
There is no such spirit in the: school
today as In old times. .They have a
football eleven, it is true, and it holds
Its head well up among its mates; a lit
tle above 'em,. too, most of the time—
the old school's the old school yet' I
tell 'em— but, after aIL It isn't the old
same nor the old spirit; I go out some
times to watch them and think, I'Well,
it's a queer gome they .play, now and
call football! 1 ' They trot out in such
astonishing toggery— padded and guard
ed from" shin to crown, welted; belted,
strapped and • buckled beyond recogni
tion. "-And no independence in
the \ play; every \ move has to be told
.'em.. It's as if they weren't big enough
to • run alone,' and ■so they hire j a big
stepmother ' of a. university "coach,"
who "stands round in a red sweater and
yells and berates them.*.- Not a man an
swers back; he doesn't dare to: 'They
don't dare eat plain Christian food, but
have a "training table" and diet like
invalids. I've seen 'em at a game not
dare take a plain drink of water. /When
they got thirsty they sucked at a wet
sponge, like babes at the bottle!
It was not so in our day. No apron
strings of a university coach were tied
to us. We were free born men. v When
we wanted to play we got together arid
went down to the old pasture, to the
big oak tree that stood near -the middle
of it, and there we would "choose up"
and take off our coats and, vests and
neckgear. and pile them round the oak
and walk out on the field and go at it—
everybody— not a pitiful | dozen or; so.'
while the rest -stood with their hands
in their pockets and looked on, but ev
erybody! And it was football; no play
ing half ; an hour .without seeing the
ball in the air once. We kicked it all
the : time . except when ; we missed it

THE DANDELION.
No More Successful Plant and None
More Wonderfml.
Perhaps none of our plants is more
common ; or [-. more familiar than ~\ the
dandelion,' and certainly none is more
wonderful. , First of all it is not a na
tive, but was Introduced from Europe,
.whence have come many of our worst
weeds, fitted by centuries of struggle in
cultivated fields to overcome * the j na
tive" plants of a continent where culti
vation had previously been practically
unknown and where natives had had
no opportunity of adapting- themselves
to the conditions ef civilized agricul
ture. ■■ . . .-'_. ':■'.{ . ' - r . s t 'f
One "of : the dandelion's strongest
points is the ability to obtain nourish
ment under strong competition and in
unfavorable situations. A deep, strong;
perennial taproot draws all available
nourishment and moisture : - from : sur
face and subsoil, stores nourishment
during the winter • and enables the
plant to start far and away, ahead of
most of its competitors. This same tap
root is exceedingly bitter, which very
likely protects it from destruction by
moles and other animals. At least I
do not remember having seen "a root
that had been disturbed by animals of
any kind. '
: But only a small portion of its food
comes from the soil. Air and sunshine
are Just as necessary, for ; the air is
food and the sunshine Is digestion for
our . vegetable .neighbors. ■■-.. Note . the
shape of the leaves. Narrow at the
base and widening at the outer end,
they form a dense rosette that not only
gets for the dandelion all the air and
sunshine coming its way, but smothers
all but the most sturdy competitors.
Here lies the secret of the dandelion's
presence in lawns and walks and open
waste I places, j jln lawns \ the grass jis
kept low so that it cannot overtop and
shade the dandelion, while its own
leaves lie so low. and close that they
are little hurt by the mower and can
smother, the grass underneath. — Har
per's Magazine. ' •
Ancient Child Burial.
.There was an order in the Church of
England up to the year 1552 that if a
child died within a month of baptism
he should be buried In his chrisom in
lieu of a shroud. The chrisom was a
white baptismal robe with which in
medieval tunes a child when chris
tened was enveloped. A sixteenth cen
tury brass in Chesham Bois church in
Buckinghamshire | represents Benedict
Lee, chrisom child, in his chrisom cloth.

stands thus:

THE SALOON QUESTION.
The board of supervisors took no
action in the liquor license question
at its last meeting. They probably
realize, as do the thoughtful business
men throughout the county, that it
is not the simple matter to deal with
as some are inclined to believe. The
Ledger has always been, aud will
always be, the advocate of morality
'in public as well as in private life.
It recognizes that the instructors of
religion and morality are engaged in
a iioble work for the uplifting of
humanity, and every encourage
ment should be afforded them in the
prosecution ,of their mission. ■■• At,
.the same time the Ledger does, not
believe in legal measures which have,
or are intended to have, a prohibi
tory effect,' in the interest of refor
mation. That the number of saloous
in the towns of Amador county is
beyond the necessities of the. popu
lation scarcely any one will deny.
It does not follow from this ad
mission, however, that any and
every attempt to reduce their num
ber or regulate the liquor traffic
must necessarity be commendable
or wise. The object sought to be
attained may be worthy of encour
agement, while the means used to
accomplish that end may be deserv
ing of censure. The liquor habit is
the greatest curse that afflicts the
civilized world. In the 'United
States it drives more victims to dis
honored graves every year than
were killed during the civil war.
How to lessen the evil withoutrtres
passing upon individual liberty is a
problem that has occupied the minds
of philanthropists and statesmen for
generations, and is as far from a
solution to-day as it ever was., It is
easy to talk of suppressing the man
ufacture and sale of intoxicants; it
is quite a different thing to carry
out such a program. The stuff is
manufactured because there is a de
mand for it. It stands on the same
business footing as any other indus
try. The industry thrives when the
demand increases; it will decline
when the demand decreases. When
the moralists succeed in so changing
human nature as to take away the
appetite for strong drink, the prob
lem will be solved — probably not till
then. ■■ * J • .';-.
The supervisors of Amador are
asked to try to curtail the evil by
limiting the number of saloons; by
making it obligatory upon the ap
plicant for a license to first secure
the signatures of a majority of the
residents of the neighborhood where
the proposed saloon is to be started;
also to increase the license to such a
sum as will close out the saloon men
of small means. These are radical
departures from the methods which
have been followed in this county
ever since it was organized. It is
well for the county managers to pon
der these propositions well before
taking action. People look with
disfavor upon anything in the nature
of a monopoly, especially if the
. monopoly is vicous in its nature and
tendency, and fostered by legislative
enactment. Those at the head of
affairs have to consider the subject
from its many-sided view points, not
from the exclusive standpoint of ab
stract morality. We can easily
..understand how injudicious action
might work a serious injury to tho
county at large, without accom
plishing any appreciable benefit.
The supreme court in the case of
Maddux vs. Walthall ou appeal from
tbe superior court of Stanislaus
county, has a^ain reiterated the
opinion that a distinguishing mark
placed upon a ballot — whether it be
a lejjal mark illegally placed, or an
illegal mark made by the voter for
the purpose of identifying the ballot,
invalidates such ballot. The case
went up mainly on the stamping of
atrossin the square opposite the
words "No nomination." The parties
were rival candidates for the oflice
of district attorney, and the contest
hinged upon the question whether
the ballots marked after the words
"No nomination" should be counted.
It was evident that these marks
were not made for the purpose of
identifying the ballots. Neverthe
less ' the supreme court maintains
that the intent of the voter Jcould
not be inquired into. The crosses
were illegally stamped, whether in
tentionally or not made no differ
ence; they should be rejected. This
decision will definitely settle the
point involved, and hereafter nomi
nating conventions will do well to
see that such dangerous snags do
not appear on the party ticket.
Every office should be "supplied
with a candidate, oven though
there be lii tie hope of electing the
nominee. This action is imperative
ly demanded as a protection to the
other nominees.
As a rule, the man with capital in
seeking a field for. investment, invari
ably prefers that locality in which his
money not only earns a profit, but
where the natural conditions, aided by
economical methods, make hfs "venture
safe as well. Like other enterprises, of
course, in which investors embark,
mining sometimes, either through lack
of judgment, bad management, or lack
of confidence sufficient to reach the
goal sought, proves a failure; tho in
vestor loses his mooey and the district
gets a black eye from which in requires
time to recover. While instances of
this character have occurred in this
county in the past, they are of ho more
frequent occurrence here, than in the
average mining community. In fact,
this is true of any mineral country
where the ore bodies are proven boyond
the perad venture of a doubt. In Ama
dor county the mining industry passed
the embryonic stage years ago. Tho
mother lode is not a conjecture. The
constant roar of stamps which greets
the ear on every hand along this now
famous lode should . be', and are, suf
ficient evidence, to the man looking for
profitable investments, that this coun
ty's mineral resources offer reasonable
inducements.
Aa a mineral producing county A ma
dor's claims for merit have long since
been proven, but because tfe~6f the
county know that its hills abound in
the precious metal in paying quantities
is no reason why we should rest on our
oars, as it were, and let it go at that.
No enterprising, man of business is satis
fied to purchase a large stock of goods
and quietly sit down and wait for cus
tomers to come his way. He immedi
ately sets about to let the people know
that he has goods to sell; that their
quality is of the best, and that his in
ducements are fair. So we who are in
terested in the progress and prosperity
of 'this county— and this applies to
every man and woman resident here—
should awaken to the full realization of
its great industrial prospects, and, at
the beginning of this new year resolve,
and put the resolution into action, to
place the resources of the county in a
more favorable light before the invest
ing public than ever before. The re
sults of united vigorous effort cannot
be estimated. - • ••

In employing help for the conduct of
his business the wise business man in
variably chooses those persons whose
personal appearance is good, whose in
tegrity is unquestioned, and in the
hands of whom be is satisfied his busi
ness interests are safe. What is ap
plicable to his help is applicable as well
to the institution upon which he be
stows his advertising patronage. The
newspaper with the most workmanlike
appearance, both as to the arrange
ment of its news matters and the dis
play of its advertisements,' and whose
integrity for conservation . has never
been questioned, must certainly offer
the only reliable field in which to pub
lish his invitations for the patronage
of customers and friends. Surely the
matter of advertising is just as im
portant as the selection of a clerk or
salesman.,

Death of E. B. Yates.
In the death of Edward Randolph
Yates, which took place last Tuesday,
a uniquo charactor in Amador's history
has been removed from the theatre of
life. Tha funeral was held from his late
residence near ■ Olela, where he had re
sided for over 53 years, ytfcterday after
noon. Many of the old friends of the
deceased met at the residence and fol
lowed the remains to the M. E. church
in Oleta, where services were conducted
by tho Rev Chas, Swithenbank, pastor
of the M. E. church at Valley Spring,
Calaveras county, who delivered an ap
propriate discourse. The attendance
was such that the church was taxed to
its utmost v capacity. A choir, consist
ing of Mr and Mrs W; F. Darling, Miss
Annie Schrader and lrwin Ostrom ren
dered suitable selections. The pall
bearers were J. W, Croff, .Henry
Schroder, Solomon Bloom, E. M.-Lld
dlcoat, B. Bacon and A. Pigeon. The
long funeral cortege then wended its
way to the local cemetery, where all
that remained mortal was laid to rest,
and the last sad rites reverently per
formed.
Deceased was born in Mecklenburg,
Mecklenburg co., Virginia, September
25, 1815. He learned the millwright
trade, and followed the same until his
health became such he was compelled
to seek a different climate. He came
across the plains, and arrived in Sacra
mento August 24, 1849, and followod
mining along the American river for a
short time; then went to San Francisco
and worked at his trade, until failing
health compelled him to return to
Placer county, from which place he
came to what was then called Fiddle
town, now Oleta, in 1850, and prepared
a home for himself and Miss Abagail
Scott,. who became his bride March 31,
1853. They were married in Amador
City, and lived .together in Olea until
Mrs Yates' demise, which occurred
Septembers, 1899. :'-. .-
Mr Yates was associate justice and
criminal judge many years ago, and
was justice of the peace of township 3
off and on for about 30 years. In many
respects squire Yates was a most re
markable character, and generous to a
fault. Seven grown children survive —
two sons and five daughters.
Probably Mayhem.
On Friday evening of last week, New
Year's night, a difficulty occurred at
the Fassero boarding house, Jackson
Gate, which will probably result in the
placing of a charge of mayhem against
one of the principals. It seems that
Paul and Antone Avansini, stopping at
the boarding house, wore treating their
fellow boarders to a vocal duet, which
was not so well received. In fact, the
lady of the boarding house and several
of the guests endeavored to cast a
damper on the musical ability of the
singers by a little harmless ridicule.
This was effective, and all thought
the incident closed, as nothing more
was thought of the matter. It seems
the supposed insult rankled in the
hearts of the Avansinis, for on the fol
lowing evening they attacked Mrs.
Fassero.' This brought the other
members of the household to the rescue,
and in the general mix-up which fol
lowed, Antone Avansini succeeded in
fastening his teeth just over the eye of
one of his assailants, and by the hold
secured dragged the man into the street,
where the piece of flesh, including a
portion of the eyebrow, was torn loose,
and it is said he managed to
swallow the dissevered flesh. He
and his brother Paul were promptly
arrested SuntJay evening and placed in
the county jail, where they are being
held to await the return of the district
attorney, who is now in the city, and
sufficient recovery of the victim, whose
name could not be learned, to enable
him to make the complaint.
THE AMADOR LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORKI A, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1904.
Assault With Deadly Weapon.
Antone Badaracca is wanted by the
officers on a charge of assault to com
mit murder. Perhaps more so than
any other individual in Amador county,
he has given the peace officers employ
ment in hunting -him up at various
times for a number of years. He lives
with his father on the Badaracca ranch
a couple of miles south of town. The
quietude of that retreat was broken
last Sunday by Antone, while under
the Influence of wine, taking the war
path. It is said he shot at his father,
and also took a' shot, at Jos. Gara
baldi, who works on the ranch. The
shots fortunately went wide of the mark.
Constable Laverone wont to tbe Bada
racca place the same evening, but
Antone was not at home; furthermore
he was told there had been no disturb
ance there. Monday, however, Gara
baldi came to town, and swore to a
warrant of arrest, and the same even
ing Sheriff Norman and deputy' Jack
son went out to arrest the accused, but
found him missing. He is evidently in
hiding until the excitement has sub
dided. The trouble heretofore has been
that the charges have not been prose
cuted owing to the relenting of - the
complaining witness, from a desire to
screen the accused:
Later. — On Thursday morning, he
having learned that Badaracca had re
turned, Sheriff Norman,' Deputy Jack
son, and Constable Laverone started
out early after their man, and by nine
o'clock had him safely landed in the
county jail. He was found alone and
.in bed in a cabin near the scene of the
trouble, and was exceedingly tame
when the officers made the arrest.
Bait over the Sweepstake Mine.
The deal over the much-advertised
Sweepstake gravel claim in Trinity
county has finally culminated in a law
suit against the vendors of the prop
erty — Judge John F. Davis, of this
county, who is now code commissioner
of the state, E. A. Davis, his brother,
and Frank' Hall of San Francisco. The
allegations of the complaint filed in tho
superior court of San Francisco against
the defendants are of a highly sensa
tional character/ . Defendants, it is
claimed, being owners of practically all
the stock of the Sweepstake Gold Min
ing and Ditch Company,- entered into
an agreement in March 1901 with the
plaintiff, Robert J. Anderson, bonding
said property for the sum of M.000,000.
to be paid in instalments of. $125,000.
Two instalments were paid, making
$250,000, and something like $700,000
were spent in putting the property in
shape ■ for • working' on a large scale.
Prior to the consummation of the
agreement, the purchaser visited the
property, and made a test of its gold
bearing qualities, which proved so
satisfactory that the negotiations- were
pushed to completion. In July IPO2,
however, the complaint recites, it was
discovered that the mine was salted,
which in mining parlance means that
tbe gold obtained ' from the testing
operations was not native-born, but
had been injected into the mine with
fraudulent intent. Judgment is asked
for the rescinding of tho agreement
and the recovery of $850,000 — the
amount paid on the purchase price and
outlay in ? opening up the mine, with
interest. This is the substance of this
highly -flavored suit. • The Ledger re
frains from comment, as the true facts
will no doubt be brought to light when
the case comes up for trial.
Died' in San Jose.
On New Year's day Amelia, wife of
Angelo Nomillini, died in San Jose, at
the age of twenty years. Death was
the result of childbirth. Deceased was
a daughter of Stephen Mori, of the
Belluoinini ranch near Jackson, and
was a native of Amador county. About
11 months ago she was united in mar
riage to A. Nomillini, and removed to
San Jose, where her husbaud was em
ployed. She was a young lady of es
timable character, greatly admired by
all who knew her. Her demise at the
threshold of womanhood is deeply de
plored, not only by her relatives, but
also by a large circle of friends. The
remains were brought to Jackson Sun
day, and the funeral took place from
the Catholic church on Monday. Not
withstanding the inclement weather a
large number of mourners attended to
pay the final tribute of respect to the
memory of the departed. The remains
were interred in the Catholic cemetery.
House Warming.
Mr. and Mrs. Geo. McMillan enter
tained a number of invited friends at
their residence on Main street last Sat
urday evening. ' Between 30 and 40
were present, and a pleasurable even
ing was passed in social chat, the play
ing of various games, and partaking of
the good things which Mrs. McMillan
had provided for the occasion . There
was every dainty calculated to tempt
the appetite, and to which the visitors
did ample justice. The party broke up
about midnight, all highly pleased with
the evening's entertainment. The
party was given as a house-warming
affair in celobration of the recent wod
ding of tho host and hostess, and their
settlement in their new home. On the
following evening a largo number of
young folks were entertained in a
similar man nor, and all had a royal

MINING NEWS HERE
AND ELSEWHERE
Amador's Thriving Industry. — Its
Mines Have Long Since Passed the
Prospective Stage— News in General
DEL Monte.— A meeting of the
directors of the Del Monte Mining and
Milling Company was held last Mon
day, when an assessment of ten cents
per share was levied, which will realize
about $5000. This amount it is be
lieved, will be sufficient to pay off the
indebtedness, and also enablo the tun
nel to be pushod forward to the point
where it is expected to intersect the
ledge— a . distance of about 150 feet.
This work is absolutely necessary to
determine the valut; of the property,
and although the assessment reaches
the maximum limit of ten ' per cent of
the par value of the stock, it was
deemed best under the circumstances
to levy the full amount at once rather
than divide it into two assessments.
The* Wide Awake.— This property
is owned by the Consolidated Wide
Awake M. is M. Co., and is located in
Railroad Flat mining district, just
ac: oss the lino of Amador in Calaveras
county. Up to the present time the
efforts of the company have been ex
pended in the thorough, development
of the mine, and as a result it is now in
a condition to furnish ore sufficient to
supply a ten-stamp mill. Just recently
a mill of that capacity has been com
pleted, and Manager Wright expects
to put it in operation to-day. The
property is wprked by a 130-foot shaft,
and 200 feet of drifting has been done
at the 60-foot level, where on each side
is a good chute of ore. The ore is free
milling, but it has been decided to also
rnaico and save concentrates.
Hooligan. — All of /Araador's min
eral resources are by no means confined
to the mother lode. An instance in
point is the Hooligan, owned and now
being operated by a company of that
name. This property is located in
Pioneer mining district, near the De
fender, one of the bost paying mines in
the district. The owners of the Hooli
gan have just completed a 140-foot tun*
net which cuts tho ledge at consider
able depth, and although as yet its ex
tent has not beon determined, a recent
assay by Weisenbein Bros., San Fran
cisco, furnishes abundant assurance of
its value. The return as shown to a
representative of this paper, by Tom
Smith, one of the owners, gives a value
of 8.19 ounces gold and 8.62 ounces sil
ver to the ton. They are quite jubi
lant-over the prospect, and are pushing
work as rapidly as possible to the end
of adding the Hooligan to Amador's
list of pay mining propositions at a
very early date.
Kennedy.— To :i person accustomed
to seeing largo mining operations a trip
to" tho Kennedy is a treat indeed, whore
everything is bustle anil industry. At
both the south and east shafts the top
operations are indicative of much work
in the drifts and stopes bolow. Besides
the constant developments being dono
in the mine, the company is making
added improvemetils to the plantabove
ground. At piweiit the foundations
are complete for the a.Wiliou of three
new boilers to the boiler plant, and the
boilers are jast beiug placed, which will
increase the numbar to vivo. When
this work has been finished] the lifting
capacity of the hoist can be developed
to 1000 horse power, although at the
present depth being worked only about
650 horse power is used. ' The hoist just
completed by the AHis-Chaltners com
pany, is capable of drawing rock from
a depth of 4000 feet, and now' hoists
skip loads of 66 cubic feet, or 6600
pounds of rock at tho rate of 2200 feet
per minute, but when taxed to its full
strength is capable of raising 17800
pounds at the i ame rate per minute.
In the mill at the east shaft ten moro
stamps were started up on Monday,
and Supt. Smith expects to have the
remaining ton o.f the sixty pounding
ore within the next week. The es
tablishment of a plant of hoisting ma
chinery of so great capactity makes a
new era in mining in this county, and
the results obtained will be watched
with interest by mining men generally.
MISCELLANEOUS.
• We understand there are about 30
men employed at the New York mine,
Railroad Flat district, developing tho
property.
News reached this offlco during the
week that the 10-stamp mill on the
Whitmore property, Volcano district,
had been completed, and is now pound
ing away on oro. .
Work on the Argonaut, next to the
Kennedy, is progressing nicely, and as
the mine is being gotten in shape for
operations, tho force is being gradually
increased. A station is now being cut
at the 1800-foot level, and as soon as
finished drifting to the lodge will be
started, and pushod as rapidly as pos
sible. In addition to this tho work of
unwatering the lower levels will con
tinue, and when accomplished, sinking
will bo resumed.
Charles D. Lane, general manager of
the Wild Goose mine, Nome, Alaska,
from whence ho has just recently re
turned, passed through town Monday
en route to Plymouth, where he has
mining interests. It is hoped that his
visit at this time may havo for its ob
ject the resumption of operations on
the property of the Plymouth Con
solidated.
At the present time good news rela
tive to the outlook in Pioneer district
is quite frequent. Among its other
good prospects is the dovelopmont be
ing done on their property, near the
Defender, by J. W. Fisher and W. E.
Moore. They have sunk a 30-foot
shaft, and are now drifting south,
about 4 feet from tho foot wall. At 15
feet from the shaft a dyke has been en
countered where the ore body seems to
have pinched up, but the grade is fairly
good, as tests have shown a value of
about $40 to the ton in gold. They
have, however, had an assay as high as
$113.10 to the ton. The owners are
confident the present development will
warrant the erection of a plant to treat
the ore, and just as soon as experi
ments have determined the most prac
ticable method, arrangements will be
made, to that end.
Installation . and . Banquet.
'.. On Wednesday evening, the 6th inst. %
Masonic hall, Jackson, was the scene
of a delightfully pleasant occasion/ It
was tbe time set by Oro Fino lodge No.
161, the ladies auxiliary to the local
lodge of the AnoientOrder of Foresters,
for the installation of its new officers
who are to serve during the coming
year. • The installation ceremony was
conducted by Mrs. DoWitt, S. G. D. D.,
assisted by Supreme . Grand ■ Herald
Mrs. Daugherty, and the obligation of
office was Impressively placed as fol
lows: G.C., Tina Schroeder; Sub C.
C, May Goldsworthy; Secy., Carrie
Calvin; Treas., Heleu Simcich; R. G.,
Carrie Lonesia; L. G., Delia Rugne;
I. G., Rose Beauchemin; O. G., Mary
Turner; Organist, Alma Mounter;
Physician, Dr. Gall; Trustee, Annie
Lumin. Prior to tbe installation two
new members were ushered into the
circle, during which a most pleasing
feature was the floor work under the
direction of Miss Lemin. After all the
ollioial business bad been disposed of,
the circle turned its attention .to mat
ters of a more social nature, and at the
conclusion of remarks for the good of
the order by various members, a splen
did program consisting of recitations,
music and tableaux, .was ' rendered as
follows: Duet, Mrs. Goldsworthy and
Miss Mounter; solo, Miss Lemin; read
ing,. . Mrs. Daugherty; chorus, Mes
dames DeWitt, Goldsworthy and Wil
son, and Misses Lemin and Mounter;
tableaux, Mignon, Miss Ratto; music,
Mrs. Forsbay, and Misses Lemin and
Schroeder; mandolin player. Miss
Schroeder; dress parade, Ratto, Le
min, Schroedor, Forshay and Wilson;
Melvina, Miss Lemin. :
Following this delightful program
came the announcement of a sumptuous
banquet, to which all repaired. Since
this feature, as well as all the others
for the evening's pleasuros, was pre
pared by the ladies, who always do well
what they undertake, it is beyond the
ken of the country quill pusher to do
justice to a description of all the good
things with which the tables were
laden. Suffice it to say, though, that
with the giving of toasts and their re
sponses, along with a foast fit for the
gods, those present found it painful to
break the spell till Time, who will npt
wait even for the glad of heart, an
nounced the far advance of another
day. The members of the circle are
quite elated over the success of the
affair, and they are entitled to all : the
pride they may feel, without fear of
bein£ termed egotists.

THE OLD RELIABLE
Absolutely Pure.
THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE
Mineral is by no means the oniy re
source of Amador county. One in
stance which justifies this statement is
a turnip measuring 38 inches in circum
ference and weighing . 17J pounds,
brought to town on ■ Monday of this
week by' Sam Lessloy,' constable at
Volcano. ■ The specimen was grown in
that vicinity, and is now on exhibition
in the office of the Globe hotel.
The clatter in Jackson on the advent
of the new year beat all past records.
A fusilade from shotguns and pistols
was kept up for hours the entire length
of Main street, reinforced by the ring
ing of all the bells in town. Yesterday
being Christmas day according to the
Greek ; church, the Slavic population
bombarded tbe atmosphere and ear
drums at the same time with an all-day
salute with giant powder. Jackson is
decidedly in it in the celebration line.

COLLAR AND CRAVAT.
Ways In Which They Affect the Ap-
pearance of the Wearer.
Men who do not want to 16bk~any
fatter in the face than they can help
have an - easy means of accomplishing
their purpose. Not all of them are
aware of the effect that may be created
by the form of a collar or cravat.
"The stout man who wants to look as
thin as he can," said a haberdasher's
clerk, "ought to wear a tie of the kind
known as a four-in-hand. Preferably
It should be dark in color and drawn
tight. That carries down the line of
the face' and lengthens it to a degree
that tends to make the face look thin
ner.
"Another aid to making a man look
thin is in the height of his collars.
Stout men who want to look thin
should wear high collars and closed
ones. Any collar that opens in front
makes • one look stouter under nearly
every circumstance. Such collars are
becoming to the thin men.
"The fat man should avoid the kind
of tie that has a horizontal effect. This
will add pounds to his appearance — in
his face, at least.
"On the contrary, this cross effect
will make the thin man look stout
The broad scarfs have little effect on a
man's looks one way or the other.
When he wears them it Is the 'collar
that makes the difference.
"lie should therefore see that he
wears a high one that does not open if
he wants to look as thin as possible,
whereas if he wants to seem stouter an
open collar will produce that effect for
him."

Didn't Care to Be Presented.
The wife of a well known naval offi
cer tells an amusing story of some of
.her experiences in Washington society.
On one occasion when she was asked to
receive at an army and navy germun a
congressman entered with a lady lean
ing upon each arm. One of the floor
committee at once approached him,
with the polite request that he give his
name in order that he might be pre
sented to Mrs. Blank, who received the
guests of the evening.
"No, thank you," was the nonchalant
reply. "I don't care to be introduced.
I have two ladles now to take care of,
and that is about as much as I can
manage."
Becoming Discouraged.
He— Your father did not object to our
marriage as much as I had expected.
She— Oh, poor papa has given up the
Idea of being too particular.— Brooklyn

cording to the London Chronicle. Its
ranks are recruited from outcasts of
all social ranks. Disgraced officers of
the Russian service, deserters from the
German army, broken scions of the
Anstrlim nobility, fraudulent debtors
from Belgium, . forgers from Spain,
homicides from America, ruined gam
blers from Italy, are found in plenty
In the ranks. No excuse is taken for a
fault, and the slightest symptom of In
subordination carries with it a swift
passage to another world. It is under
stood that recruits are simply seeking
refuge from the arm of the civil law.
The foreign legion is the only volun
tarily enlisted corps in the French

against the Arabs and is always, placed

The Harmless Grass Snake.
The poor, harmless grass snake Is the
subject of stories almost as wonderful
as those related of the adder. The
superstition that, however much you
may hammer it, it will not die till the
setting of the sun is widely held. A
fable not so generally held to is that
even at sundown it will not die if you
should neglect to tell some one of what
you have done. The rule on seeing one
of these, terrible creatures is to "hit It
and ; tell"— that is, give It a good drub
bing and run quickly and tell some one.
The best snake story is from Leigh
Sinton, near Malvern, according to a
London correspondent. A laborer
states that he had killed a grass snake
and hung it on a tree. The blood
dripped down and a toad came and
swallowed some, dying instantly! ,.
The fancy that makes this species
poisonous or even harmful is a wild
one, but how much more wild Is that
which attributes violent toxic proper
ties to any 'chance drop of blood from
its body! It might have been thought
that the other popular belief that poi
sonous things cannot be poisoned would
have saved the life of the poor toad. —

What Columbus Might Have Done.
There are relatives of Columbus liv
ing in Spain at the present time. It is
said that gambling debts are keeping
them poor. These persons look to the
United States with wistful eyes, hoping
that some patriotic American will con
fer on them a few millions in recogni
tion of their distinguished ancestor.
This fact led a statistician to work his
brain, and he published the statement
that had Columbus placed $1 at com
pound interest at 0 per cent 400 years
ago his descendants today would pos
sess a sum amounting to more than
$8,000,000,000. When these figures were
published Lyman J. Gage was secre
tary of the treasury. His attention
was called to the tremendous possibil
ity of a single dollar, and his comment
was either a sincere remark or a well
adapted pun. He said, "Indeed, to me
this is a story of great interest"
Honors Were Busy.
"In the church 'I attended as a boy,"
said a New York man, "there were fre
quent clashes between the minister
and the choir. The minister thought
the choir irreverent and unmusical.
The choir thought him a back number.
Each tried to give the other a dig on
every possible occasion.
"One Sunday, I remember, there was
a clash wherein the honors were about
even. The minister, after. the choir
had sung the opening hymn, said with
a significant smile, that his text would
be from Acts xx,.' And after the uproar
was ceased.' But the choir, at the ser
mon's end, retorted neatly with the
anthem, 'It Is Time to Awake From
Sleep."'
The Stick: Insect of Borneo.
The longest known insect ia undoubt

In a remarkable manner a piece of

is extremely difficult to distinguish be
tween the Insect and the bark. Borneo
Is also the home of one of the largest
species of dragon fly. A specimen of
the subfamily sesebna measures six

Boston Could Stand It.
Ralph Waldo Emerson once made a
crushing reply to a man who asked
him whether the people in Boston did
not feel alarmed. Said Emerson,
"What about?" Said the man, "Why,
the world is coming to an end next
Monday." Emerson replied: "I'm glad
of It. We can get along a great deal
better wlthoutlt."
A Slight Fire.
"I say, Miss De Witt," remarked
young Sapleigh, "youh wesplendent

"Never mind, Mr. Sapleigh," replied
Miss De Witt, "the conflagration will be
too insignificant to necessitate the call-
Ing out of the fire brigade."

THE TOWN OF YAFA.
Famous In History and the Host In*
terestlns Spot In Palestine.
Yafa is a little town that was many
times destroyed alike by Jews, Assyr
ians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans aud
Turks. It .was to Yafa that Hiram,
kiug of Tyre, sent the cedar wood "in
flotes" which from there were taken
to .Jerusalem for Solomon's temple.'
Jonah sailed from this ' little town to
Tarshlsh when fleeing from the face of
the Lord. It was In Yafa that the
bumble Dorcas lived her life of good
deeds and upon her dying was raised
to life by Peter. To this shore the
great Richard Coeur de Lion swam,
girded in armor, fighting for Christen
dom, and won a victory for the cru
saders over the Arab. Bonaparte left
a memory of his cruelty here by his
massacre of several thousand prisoners
and the poisoning or some persons af
flicted with the plague. | Simon the tan
ner's house, where Peter learned that
all nations were acceptable before
God, is one of the few sights to be
seen in Yafa. In the courtyard there
is a large well of spring : water, and
from the roof of the house a most
beautiful view of the surrounding
country presents itself. Another site
of Interest In the tomb of Tabitha,
which stands in the garden of the
Greek monastery, close to an old foun
tain, among the orange groves and
fruit orchards. Of all towns in Pales
tine, Yafa is one of the most interesting
for its antiquity and its strange mix
ture of the oriental in its most primi
tive form with European civilization

Turtles Tenacious of Life.
The way cats cling to their proverbial
nine lives is well known, but the aver
ago turtle will make a tougher stand
than nine ordinary cats. Perhaps boll
ing will kill a turtle at once, but any
other method seems hopeless.
The severed head of a snapping tur
tle will bite for an hour after separa
tion from the body. But more wonder
ful is the indifference of the green tur
tle of. the West Indies to mutilation.
A party of naturalists lately returned
give an account of an experience which
proves beyond doubt that the green
turtle's indifference does not lie In its
head. : . , -':r:: r :-
A green turtle found ou the beach
turnod and made for the water. One
of the party severed its head with an
nx and turned the body around. The
headless turtle ran. theu stopped and
turned toward the water again.

Tho Boston woman pleaded and said
potolifutly: "I am quite sure my guests

"My terras as a dinner entertainer are

Then Melba got her wraps and went

HOW HE BECAME A LAWYER
rke Story of John* Sherman's A tl-
misston to the Bar.
When John Sherman was quite
roung he was taken Into the law office
»f his brother Charles at Mansfield, 0.,
io help about the office and make him
lelf generally useful. One day when he
was In . his twenty-first year he took
Charles one side and quietly asked him
for a loan of ?50.
"What!" Charles exclaimed. "What
Io you intend doing with so much
money?" I
"1 am going to Columbus to be ad
mitted to the bar," John replied.
Charles was greatly surprised, aa
lohn had never asked him for any ad
rice regarding the profession nor had
he ever appeared to be Interested to any
extent in the study of law.
"You can't be admitted to the bar
■/ithout some knowledge of the law,"
laid Charles. : - ; ' . ■ ' ."'-.
John maintained that he knew more
about law than - some others and as
rared his brother that he would try to
raise the money somewhere.
"You know," he added, "it will be
necessary for me to have respectable
clothes and enough money to pay my
traveling and hotel expenses."
Charles finally j ordered the clothes
and provided him with the necessary
money. At Columbus on the day he
became of age John was admitted to
the bar. On his return he said to
Charlesf
"I am going to lowa to practice law."
Charles remonstrated with him.
"There is room for both of us to prac
tice law here in Mansfield," Charles
told him.
They then and there became partners"
and continued to practice together un
til . the formation of the Republican
party, when John was sent from the
Mansfield district as a representative
In congress.
Later he was elected to the United
States senate, and the balance of his
life became a very important and in
teresting part of the history of his
country.— Washington Star.
THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE.
Valuable Territory It Draught to the
United State*.
The. upper portion of the Louisiana
purchase was known as the territory of
Louisiana. It comprised all that terri
tory north of the thirty-third degree of
latitude, eastward to the Mississippi
and westward and northward as far as
the undetermined boundaries of the
newly acquired possessions might ex
tend. South of this was the district of
Orleans, with its seat of government
fixed at New Orleans. The cession of
the upper part of the purchase did not
take place until March 10, 1804, when;
having received the cession from the
Spanish, the French representative
handed it over to the agent of the Unit
ed States with a very brief and simple
ceremony. - •
By these unimpressive .proceedings
the government of the United States
was put in possession of territory with
in jwhose boundaries now flourish the
states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Missou
ri, Kansas, lowa, Nebraska, North Da
kota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Idaho,
Montana, the Indian . Territory, and
parts of the states of Minnesota? and
Colorado. The men r who were the ac
tive .agents | in' the ' transfer of this
mighty land from one' national jurisdic
tion to another are well nigh forgotten
in the crowd and rnsbx of later but not
less important events. \ By this historic
purchase the seat of at mighty empire
was forever established; By this pur
chase the possibilities lot developing
from the republic a wotld power were
strengthened. Under our benignant
rule comfort, luxury, prosperity and
every variety of material activity fill
the wide spaces (in which our fathers
found only a trackless wilderness. Com

MARINE ART.
Virtues and Defects ot , the Ships
That Sailors Faint.
It is an axiom with sailors that there
never was a man who put in three
years before the mast who did .'not
think he could paint a ship better than
the most skillful landlubber that ever
wielded a brush. In the homes of re
tired sea captains specimens of this
kind of marine art are often displayed
on the walls to ndciiring friends and
are handed down as family heirlooms.
A good place for the man who has no
seagoing relatives or j friends to see
such pictures Is in some of the win
dows of ship supply stores on South
street in New York: Sailors buy them
occasionally.
Ships that sailors paint are absolutely
correct In every detail. From a brig to
a full rigged three master there is not a
block or tackle missing from stem to
stern or from masthead to water line.
No marine painter could get in half so
much detail if he tried. But the ships
painted by sailors look as if they were
caught fast in frost tipped waves.
There is absolutely no life or any sug
gestion of motion about them even
when represented as going under full
sail. When a sailor tries to get in a bit
of landscape as a background, as. he
usually does, he makes matters hope
lessly worse. As a general thing it is a
lighthouse or a fort looking for all the
world like little images that children
take out of their toy arks.— New York
Press. £*£?
Diagnosing; Under Difficulties.
-Dr.Sundberg, former consul to Bag
dad, related with much gusto an ad
venture that befell him in a Moham
medan harem in Bagdad. One of the
wives of a rich merchant fell sick, and
Dr.' Sundberg was called in to prescribe
for her. With a pardonable scientific
interest the western physician -waited.
Enter a black gunnysack. It is the pa
tient. The doctor would like to feel her
pulse. A white hand is slipped through
an opening. Good. And her tongue-f
impossible! No man save her husband
may see the face of a woman and live
or, more accurately, no woman j may
unveil her face to any man save her
husband and live. His professional in
terest aforesaid deeply aroused, the dip
lomatic doctor insists. The difficulty is
at length solved by the eunuch in chief.
Though the woman may not lawfully
unveil herself, the doctor under the cir
cumstances might perhaps be allowed
to crawl in under the gunnysack and so
examine the telltale tongue. "Delight
ed, I'm sure," says the doctor," and does
so. Then after the most thorough diag
nosis imaginable he prescribes,* as did
Abernethy before him, "A little sun
and air!"
The Absent Jack.
. The wife of a Washington street
merchant is very fond of roses, espe
cially of the brilliant varieties. By
way of reminder she said to the hus
band the other morning before he
started for business:
"I see, my dear, that Jacks are be
coming cheaper." ..
"That • may be true," said the hus
band absently, "but ' I have known
men who would have been willing to
pay $100 for one to put with the two
