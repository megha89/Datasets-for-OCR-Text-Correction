COURT DECISION
Coffman Habeas Corpus
In the superior court of the state of
Cailfornia, in and for the county of
Amador.
In the matter of the application of
J. M. Coffman for a writ of habeas
corpus.
The prisoner having been held in the
custody of the sheriff of this county,
upon an order made by a committing
magistrate holding him .to answer to
this court for the crime of an assault
with a deadly weapon with intent to
murder, and having sought his release
from custody upon the ground that
the evidence adduced upon. his exami
nation before such magistrate, and
which is attached to his petition ior
the writ, was insufficient to show pro
bable cause of his guilt of such crime
or ot any included within the informa
tion, was, after presentation : of
authorities and argument thereon, dis
charged from custody last evening,
and the court at that time having been
unable to file its reasons therefor,
owing to pressure of business, now
files its opinion upon the questions
involved in this application.
Briefly stated, such evidence shows
that one Manuel Lopez and John De
lucchi had a fight on the porch in front
of Coffman 'B place of business in
Amador City on the 29th day .of
August of this year. ■.■ ' A crowd
gathered, and during the disturbance
Coffman came out and ordered them
off the porch and returned inside.

Prefered Death,
To Operation
When told that the only hopes for
saving her life depended upon an im
mediate operation. Mrs Michael Dabo
vich, who had been suffering with
strangulated hernia for several weeks,
told Dr. Endicott that she would take
the chances and flathy refused to con
sider the proposition of an operation,
and death relieved her of her pain on
Tuesday night. •
The patient had been receiving medi
cal attention from an outside physician
for a number of weeks, and as a last
resource, Dr. Endicoti was called ; in.
After diagnosing the case, an opera
tion was deemed the only possible
means ot saving the life, and the
patient was accordingly informed of
her actual condition. She, however,
as before stated, refused to have the
operation, and died in great pain.
Dr. Endicott has had absolute suc
cess in all of his hernia operations]
and stated that here was every reason
to believe that had his patient con
sented to undergo the operation her
chances of recovery would have been
excellent.
Arm Broken-
While descending Peek's hill on
Tuesday morning last, . Henry D.
Emerson, a local reporter of the Dis
patch, slipped, and in falling threw
out his hands to save a hard bump. In
so doing, his left arm became twisted,
resulting in the fracture of a small
bone. Dr. Endicott dressed the in
jured arm and put it in splints.
New Official Terms

Next Monday at 12 o'clock noon, is
supposed to be the time when the new

SAMPO GETS
LIFE SENTENCE
Drytown Murderer Gets
Maximum Penalty
For Crime
Last Tuesday was the day fixed by
the court for pronouncing sentence
upon Giacomo Sampo, who was con
victed last week of murder in the
second degree in the killing of Stefano
Pistoni in Drytown in November last.
The court room was filled with spec
tators.
Defendant's counsel, Spagnoli &
Spagnoli, made a motion for a hew
trial. Presenting a list of 17 errors
which they claimed had been made in
the trial of the case. The motion was
denied. The attorneys then asked for
an arrest of judgment in order to in
vestigate new evidence claimed to have
been discovered by them. This motion
was also denied.
D. B. Spagnoli then made an ap
peal for leniency. Judge Wood in a
sympathetic and deliberate manner
said : I have given this case my care
ful study. I have thoroughly reviewed
the evidence, and 1 positively believe
this man Giacomo Sampo is guilty of
the brutal murder with which he
stands convicted. I honestly believe
him to be guilty of causing the death
of Stefano Pistoni by beating him on
the head with a rock. As to leniency
because the pitiable condition in which
his wife and child are placed, I can
only say that it is the same in all
criminal cases where guilt is proven.
The innocent must suffer with the
guilty.
Requesting the prisoner to stand up
the judge said :
"It is the sentence of the court that
you serve a term for the rest of your
natural life in the prison at Folson."
i The young wife of the convict, . with
*<ierbsbe clutched close to her breast,
fairly shook with suppressed sobs. ■ ■
Attorney for the defendant then en
terec a formal appeal to the higher
court, in which fifteen reasons are set
forth. -
Judge Woods was interviewed after
the trial, and when asked why tne
maximum sentence was pronounced,
said :
The evidence in the case seemed to
indicate that Sampo was a man of re
vengeful nature, and one who was
likely to commit muider, acting under
real or visionary grievances.
If he is that kind of a man, society
should be protected against him, and
he ought to be confined for life. On
the other hand, if he is not of a crimi
nal nature, his conduct while confined
in state's prison will disprove the
fact.
Under a life sentence he may be
paroled after serving eight years of
his term, while if he were sentenced
to imprisonment for 20 or 30 or 40
years, or for any definite number of
years, he would be compelled to serve
at least one-half of the term, before
an application for parole could be en
tertained. ■
Satrpo's deliberate act of perjury,
in stating that he was not present at
the scene of the crime, prevented both
the court and the jury from a proper
inquiry of mitigating circumstances,
if any did exist.
Installing Meters
T. J. Burrows is putting in meters
throughout the city in all places where
electric light or power is being used.
This move will be better for both the
company and customers. The consumer
will pay for what he gets, and the
company will charge for what is used.
Under the flat rate, there was neces
sarily some inequality.
Repairing Parsonage
The Greek parsonage is being en
larged so as to make ample quarters
for the new pastor and his family, who
will occupy them in the near future.
Rev. W. P. Kesherarorf, who comes
here from Sitka, Alaska, says he is
very much delighted with his new
charge, and claims that his outlook
in the new field is encouraging. The
clergyman's family are as yet in the
far : orth, but will come here as soon
as the rectory is in a habitable condi
tion. .
The services in Jackson every second
week, are held on Saturday evening at
6 o'clock, Sunday morning at 10
o'clock, and Sunday night at 6 o'clock.
PIONEER BURIED
Andrew Barton Passed
Away Last Monday

Andrew Barton, a native of Monroe
ville, Ohio, passed to his long rest at
the home of his sister, Mrs Bradley,
on Water street, on Monday last. De
ceased was well known in this city,
where he has for many years been en
gaged in the milk business. He was
72 years of age, yet up to the time of
his sickness, was conducting his milk
route with the same regulariy and at
tention which his customers have al
ways received of him.
He was taken sick the fore part of
last week, but although complaining
of feeling bad, continued his business
route until Friday, on which day his
illness developed into pneumonia of
an alarming character. His attending
physician says there was every symp
tom of a recovery until Sunday, when
all hope had to be abandoned, and the
patient sank into the embrace of
death.
Barton migrated to California in
1853, and was a pioneer in Amador
county. During the war of the rebel
lion he enlisted in California. regiment

CHRISTMAS
SERVICES
City Churches Celebrate
Holy Day With Im
pressive Programs
The Christmas services in the Jack
son churches, were in keeping with
the great feast day. St. Patrick's
church was crowded to its capacity at
high mass, which was celebrated by
Rev. Father Gleason at 10 o'clock in
the morning. An augmented choir
rendered several charming Christmas
seletions.
The services at the Methodist church
were conducted in the Sunday school
room in the morning, and in the even
ing, in the Odd Fellows building. Rev.
J. O. Duncan, used as his subject for
the evening discourse, "Jesus." He
demonstrated the importance of ac
cepting Christ as the savior of man
kind. A special choir rendered
Christmas music-
St. Augustine's Episcopal church
had a banner Christmas. Services
were conducted in the evening by the
rector, Rev. Thos Shea, and the build
ing was fairiy packed. The special
music was well rendered and greatly
enjoyed.
No services were conducted in the
Greek Catholic church, as the pastor
was obliged to hold services in Angels
Camp on Christmas day.
Have You Met Him?
Naturally a defeated candidate, is
sore over the blighting of his official
aspirations. So is the politician who
wakes up the morning after election
to find that things did not go his way.
This disappointment is manifested in
different ways, according to the tem
perament of the individual. Some
take it good raturedly, and bow with.-^
out outward manifestations oi titter
ness to the popular will. Others,
harbor the idea that the voters were
all abroad in their expressions of
choice at the ballot box. They hug
the delusion that the turning down of
themselves or their men was a blun
der, a sort of revolt against good
government, and lose no opportunity
of showing their irreconcilable spirit
in the effort to weaken the successful
ones. Sometimes this is done with
the view of their political future.
They start in at the beginning to build
up their broken fences and disrupted
hopes, by trying to tear down the
well-kept fences of their opponents.
As a rule, voters properly regard
show this kind of spirit, as a sure in
dication that no mistake was made in
the refusal to follow their leadership.
Citizens of Amador county should not
lend an ear to criticism of the acts of
officials prompted by motives of disap
pointed ambition. The blindest man
politically, is he who imagines he can
fool the people by such tactics.
Pleasant Social Held
Last evening a large assemblage of
friends gathered at the Methodist par
sonage, on Church street, this city, as
the gue3ts of the Rev. and Mrs. Dun
can. The social was held in honor of
their daughter, Miss V. C. Duncan,
who is spending the holiday season
with her parents.
A delightful program was rendered
consisting of music, readings and
recitations.
At the conclusion of the program
delicious refreshments were served.
Fine Team of Horses
Sheriff-elect, John S. Davis, has
purchased a mate to his black horse,
and the team thus formed makes
about the handsomest pair of animals
in this district. They are young, and
have both speed and spirits, which are
very essential features in the make-up
of a good team. The horses are each
of about 1100 pounds in weight, and
were purchased in Xl Dorado.
Toe Badly Smashed
While attempting to lift a heavy
tank of gasoline from a wagon, at the
city stone crushing plant yesterday
afternoon. John Going had the big
toe on his left foot badly smashed.
The injured man was taken to the
office of Dr. Gall, and relieved of
much suffering when the injury was

THE NEW REVENUE SYSTEM.
The adoption of the constitutional amendment separating
state and county taxation is already causing much discussion
as to the effect it will have in the increase or curtailment of
revenue for county purposes. The next assessment of prop
erty will be made in conformity with the new order of things,
and financial solons are busy preparing a bill to be passed
by the incoming legislature to carry out the provisions of the
amendment. Under the new method .certain classes of prop
erty, such as railroads, telegraph and telephone lines, ielec
tric light and power companies, express and banking corpor
ations, will be taxed for state purposes; and the state govern
ment will have to depend for support upon the revenue raised
from these sources, without any general levy upon all tax
able property, as has heretofore been the case. The county
governments will be maintained by a tax levied upon the
balance of the property left after these state taxed items are
eliminated. It is evident that this radical change in the
revenue laws will bear very uuequally upon different coun
ties, according to the value of state-taxed properties within
their respective borders. Some counties in which the pro
portion of state-class property is above the average will be
adversely affected, while those counties where the proportion
is below the average will be benefited by the new departure,
To reduce this disturbance of financial conditions to a mini
mum, at least until the new system becomes fairly estab
lished, the state will make good any loss sustained by a
county for a certain period — five years we understand. How
the state will be reimbursed for this liberality dees not ap
pear, as there is no provision that the counties financially
helped by the change shall divy up their gains for a co '-re-
How is Auiador county likely to be affected by the new
deal— adversely or otherwise ? — may be asked. The tax rate
for state and county p'uposes has averaged in the neighbor
hood of $2 on the $100 for a number of years past. Of this
levy about one-fifth has been represented by the state tax.
It therefore follows that the county can stand a reduction of
one-fifth in its assessment roll without suffering any loss of
revenue for local purposes. That is to say, a tax levy of $2
on the $100 011 an assessment roll four-fifths as large as at
present would leave us practically unchanged. With an
assessment roll of between five and six million dollars under
the old regime, a shrinkage of a million dollars in valuation
would not disturb the county finances. It is difficult to ap
proximately estate the value of Amador county property that
will be set off for state assessment. The Pacific Gasjand
Electric Company's holdings are assessed for about half a
million dollars. The railroad and other corporation property
included in the state class will easily, all told, bring the sum
total over the million dollar mark. But a portion of this
property, classed as "inoperative,' 1 will still be retained for
county assessment. How much will be so held will depend
upon legislative action defining the scope and meaning of in-
operative property.
It is being heralded throughout the state that at a recent
'meeting of county assessors an important point was gained
for the counties by having certain portions of corporatiou
property included in the " inoperative" class, and therefore
assessable by the county assessors. While this action is
doubtless merely advisory to the legislature in the framing
of a bill on the subject, still it indicates a likely source o f
content between the state and county authorites over the new
revenue system. With the division of the corporate prop
eity into "operative'' and " inoperative," the first named as
sessable by the state and the latter by the county, the battle
will be on for each side to get as much as possible of this
property included in its respective class. To swell the "in
operative" column will mean more pickings for the county
assessors and increased revenue or a reduced tax levy for the
county. The capture of recruit property for the "operative"
column will mean either enhanced income for the state or a
reduction of taxes for the corporations concerned. This dual
authority seems a vulnerable feature, likely to give birth to
considerable litigation before it is definitely settled by the
courts, and several years will doubtless pass ere the new law
gets down to a smooth working basis.

A flexible armor of concrete bricks
strung on wires is a novel anchor for a
sand deposit, and is a French solution
of the problem of preventing the wash
ing away of river and lake shores and
even the shifting of. dunes exposed to
the ocean. The bricks, weighing ten
pounds each, are pierced with two
holes each for the passage of gal
vanized iron or copper wires. The
slope being properly graded, a horizon
tal wire cable is stretched along its
bottom, wirea are attached to this,
and the bricks are shipped upon the
wires so- as to lie close together in
regular rows. The bricks can be made
and laid rapidly, the gravelly sand of
the locality being used with : the
cement. A number of applications of
this method of land protection have
been made in France, and have suc
cessfully resisted water, frost and
ocean gales for two or three years.
The sheathing of the Soulac. dune,
soon to be extended 3500 feet, is now
900 feet long and 20 feet high. The
first part was completed early in 1909,
and has withstood some bad storms.
The "parasol" with which the eyes
of such birds as owls, eagles and cocks
are protected, has been the subject of
recent experiments by French natural
ists.' This is a black, opaque mem
brane attached to the retina near the
optic nerve, and, while it closes into a
thin line that does not . interfere with
vision, it opens so as to completely
cover the retina and protect it from
strong light. The eagle that boldly
faces the sun sees nothing, for his
curious eye parasol is spread.
To prevent earthquakes seems to be
the most surprising of the many
reasons for restoring forests. It is
suggested that in such localities as-
Messina and southern Italy, cutting
away the forests has loosened the
soil, and this may have given rise to
faults and added to the earthquake
disturbances or their effects. If this
theory.is correct, of course replanting
the trees should again bind the loose
material with roots, giving the surtace
its old time greater stability.
Since the growth of cast iron under
repeated heatings first attracted atten
tion some years ago, various explana
tions have been offered. Superheated
steam causes high pressure steam
valves to become enlarged, and in the
great Baltimore tire cast-iron beams
were so changed by the intense heat as
to distort and ruin masonry building,
while the buildings in which cast steel
had been used were not affected. Re
peated heatings cause cast-hon bars to
become porous and cracked. Prof. H.
Carpenter, a British metallurgist, ex
plains that the growth has now been
definitely ascribed to the chemical re
action that takes place between the
flame gases and the constituents of the
iron, especially to the change of sili
con to silica, and also to the reaction
between the flame gases and the gases
originally dissolved in the iron. To
obtain iron that will not grow it has
been necessary to give care to its com
position. The silicon must be removed
as nearly as possible, and all carbon
contained must be in chemical com
bination with the iron, none being pre
sent in the free state.
Changes of pressure over the great
areas of high and low barometer that
persist for long periods over much of
the earth's surface are regarded by
Dr. Otto Klotz as a cause of earth
vibration, or microseisms. The crea
tion or alteration of those areas shifts
a vast load, and may Bet up vibrations
in blocks of the earth's crust covering
tens of thousands of square miles.
Differences of temperature or the
transient differences due to the pas
sage of storm or fair weather areas
would have little influence. The nature
of the vibrations produced is possibly
dependent on or modified by marked
geological configuration, and when
once set up the vibrations many con
tinue lung after the cause hau disap
peared.
Though aeroplane engines represent
a gain in lightness, they show a loss
in fuel economy. Such is the result of
teats carried out at the National Pysi
cul Laboratory in England, where it
has been learned that the Gnome en
gine, so famous for lightness per
horse-power, uses 0.89 pounds of fuel
per brake horse-power hour, while a
good automobile engine runs on 0.54
pound.
As water is heated above 212 deg,
F., the pressure risea very rapidly
with the increasing temperature of
the steam, but the new method of
superheating without 'the' water may
give steam a temperature higher than
that of red-hot Iron with a pressure
perhaps not exceeding a pound per
square inch. Thia method has been
applied to heating bakers' ovens.
Superheated steam has been -used in
the old way for baking, but the tem
perature of 700 deg. or 800 deg. or
more develops a pressure that may
reach 2,000 pounds per square inch,
and as the steam-pipes passing around
the oven become rusted and worn there
is much risk from bursting pipes. By
the new plan, the steam is first
generated in a small boiler. It is then
passed through a number of pipes in
a furnace, and is there superheated to
1000 deg. before entering the pipes of
the oven. In the process of baking
only a part of the heat is given off,
the steam being left sufficiently hot
for boiling and other purposes before
it condenses again to water. Steam
superheated in this way, being safe
and economical, is recommended for a
variety of uses.
Considering the curious fact that an
electric shock of 100 volts is sometimes
fatal, while currents of 1000 volts do
not always kill, a British Medical As
sociation paper points out that the
effects depend upon many factors. The
volume, or amperage, of the current
as well as its tension may count. The
character of the current— whether it
is direct or alternating— may play
some part, and the duration of the
shock and the point of application may
signify much. Then, too, the resis
tance of the skin, is not always the
same. Ono individual may differ
greatly from another in susceptibility,
and even the conditon of the mind is
found to have an influence, as a person
prepared to receive a shock is less
liable to be affected than one receiving
The action of light on plants has
been shown by Combes, a French
botanist, to vary with its intensity,
as well as with the age and character
of the plant. A strong light favors
the development of large stores of re
serve material, as in the tubers of the
potato and the root of the beet, and
a weaker light tends instead to pro
mote the growth of vegetative organs.
End's Winter's Troubles
To many, winter is a season of
trouble. The frost bitten toes and
fingers, chapped hands and lips, chil
blains, cold sores, red and rough skin,
Jprove this. But such troubles fly : De-
Tore Bucklen's Arnica salve. A trial
convinces. Greatest healer of burns,
boils, piles, cuts, sores, eczema and
sprains. Only 25c at Spagnoli's drug
store.
Land Office Rules.
New rules of practice governing
cases before the United States local
land office, the general land office and
the department of the interior have
been approved by secretary Ballmger.
The new rules which will go into effect
February Ist, are intended to simplify
practice, to avoid delay and to reduce
the number of successive appeals.
Under the present system it is said the
multitude of appeals give advantage
to a contestant of wealth over one who
is poor. A contest against an entry
or claim of record, under the new
rules, can only be instituted by a per
son who seeks to acquire title to or
claims an interest in the land in
volved, and the grour.d of the contest
must be based on matters not disclosed
by the records of the land department.

Will Promote Beauty
Women desiring beauty get wnderful
help from Bucklen's Arnica Salve. It
banishes pimples, skin eruptions, sores
and boils. It makes the skin soft and
velvety. It glorifies the face. Cures
sore eyes, old sores, cracked lips,
chapped hands. Best for burns, scalds,
fever sores, cuts, bruises and piles. 25c

Will of F. W. Zeile
Filed for Probate
The will of F. W. Zeile, formerly
one of the leaders in San Francisco
banking circles, has been filed for pro
bate. It leaves an estate valued at
$200,000 to the immediate relatives.
Mr Zeile died December 3, 1910. His
will bears the date May 18, 1909. Miss
Marion Zeile is named as executrix
without bonds. She is heir to one
third of the estate. The remainder is
divided between Mrs Ida May Zeile,
the testator's widow, and Miss Kuth
Zeile, a daughter. For the past several
years Mr Zeile was an invalid and took
no active part in business. The greater
part of his fortune was invested in
real estate in the Sacramento Valley.
Most of the money was made in bank
ing and in the warehouse business.—
Argonaut.

Cain's Wife
"I never discuss marriage*," said
the late Gen. Fitzhugh Lea, to the
Womans' Companion, "without think
ing of an old colored preacher in my
state who was addressing his dark
skinned congregation, when a white
man rose in the back of the building.
Ji"Mr Preacher," said the white man.
"Sir to you," said the parson.
"Mr Preacher, you are talking
about Cain, and you say he got
married in the land of Nod, after he
killed Abel. But the Bible only men
tions Adam and Eve as being on the
earth at that time. Who, then, did
Cain marry?"
"The colored preacher snorted with
unfeigned contempt.
"Huh!" he said. "You hear dat,
brederen an' sisteru? You hear dat
fool question I am axed? Cain, he
went to de land 0' Nod, just as de
Good Book tells us, an' in de land o*
Nod Cain gits so lazy an' so shiftless
dat he up an' marries a gal o' one o'
dem no 'count white trash families dat
de inspired apostle didn't consider
littin' to mention in do Holy Word."

Copper Hlil thoroughly sustained its
reputation for hospitality and enjoy

ing the evening the following program
was carried out : 'Recitation by Jack
son Hall, Curtis Barney. Janie Taylor,
Henry Kreth, Thos. j Taylor, Mabel

Mrs F. A. Taylor is the proud pos
sessor of two yards of hand-made silk
lace of fabulous price, presented to
her by her friend Mrs Minnie Hall, in
whose family it has been an heirloom
of over two hundred years. Mrs Hall
is of the Kentucky Bell family. The
lace was on exhibition at the mid
winter fair, and experts declare that
the production ceased two hundred and
fifty years before. This lace was
worn on England's throne before the
American revolution, and has twice
been in possession of the White House
ladies ;once when Dolly Madison graced
the place, and later when Zachary
Taylor's wife resided there.. , But per
haps it has never had a prouder pos
sessor than the present owner, not
only for intrinsic value, but also for
the affection which prompted the gift.
Mrs F. Taylor's wonderful control,
of animals saved her from what might
have proved a very serious accident
last Monday morning. Mrs Taylor
and son were returning from Cosumnes
after taking her daughter to hen
school. One of the spirited team fell |
so suddenly that when the buggy hitj
it the force broke the whlpple-tree, i
and one trace on the other horse. |
With great presence of mind Mrs Tay- j

New Dwelling House .
Dwelling houses • are scarce around
Jackson. Daily inquiries are made for
small residences suitable for workers
in the mines, and a number could be
rented if they were to be had. The
building of houses for renting -purposes
has not been looked upon as an invit
ing field for investment, and building
has been slow for several years. We
are pleased to notice that building is
being • undertaken ■to meet the * de
mand. I Jos. Privitali is building a
five-roomed dwelling at Newmanville,
next to the residence of Jos. Coombs.
The frame is all up, and when finished
the residence will be quite an attrac
tive one. .The owner is; doing the

The ancient Egyptians were skilled
In the art of tanning leather and man- |

various purposes besides that of fuc

it is to those builders of the pyramids
that we ure Indebted for the first artis

can be ascertained from history and
the researches of archaeologists, the
Egyptians were the first shoemakers
who were worthy of that name. It Is
a fact. too. that tanuers of today em
ploy very much the same methods
as did the ancients. About the same
materials are used, and the processes
nre almost precisely similar to those In

true that tanners of the present day

Jutt Like Eve's Apple.
A fruit supposed to bear the mark of
Eve's teeth Is one of the many botan
ical curiosities of Ceylon. The tree on
which it grows j a known by the sig
nificant name of "the forbidden fruit,"
or "Eve's apple tree." The blossom
has a very pleasant scent, but the real
ly remarkable feature of the tree, the
one to which it owes Its name, Is the
fruit It Is beautiful and hangs from
the tree In a peculiar manner. Orango
on the outside and deep crimson with
in, each fruit has the appearance of
having had a piece bitten out of It.
This fact, together with its poisonous
quality, led the Mohammedans to rep
resent It as the forbidden fruit of ths
garden of Eden and to warn men
against Its noxious properties. The
mark upon the fruit Is attributed to
Eve. Why the bite of Adam did not
also leave Its mark Is not known, but
as only one piece seems to be missing
Its loss Is ascribed to the woman.

MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
The Dialogue That Took Plac» After
the Dane* Ended.
A well known and popular Los An
geles physician upon the* occasion oC
a recent visit to n professional friend
at Fresno (the pbysiclnn In charge of.
the state Institution for the deaf nml
dumb) was invited to attend one of
the periodical "hops" given the In
mates. All the unfortunates and a
goodly sprinkling of guests were pres
ent.
Before the function had progressed
very far the Fresno physician ap
pronched his Los Angeles medical
friend with, "Get busy, doctor!" The
doctor got busy. Although tipping the
scales nt 210, he Is an easy and grace
ful dnncer and much enjoys tho exer
cise. Approaching a young lady of
singular sweetness and beauty, he In
dicated his desire to dance with her.
She proved to be as witching with, her
feet as with her eyes, and our Los An-
Celcs friend, In contempt of all con
vention, danced two or three number*
with her.
At the close of the last one a gen

ANCIENT LONDON.
When Danger and Lanthorns War*
Abroad After Dark.
. Less than 200 years ago the watch
men of London town, carrying horn
lanthorns and halberds, dressed in long:
coats and knee breeches, walked up
and down the cobbled streets of the
world's largest city chanting the fol
lowing verse:
A fight there."malds ! Hang out your light
And see your horns be clear and bright.
That so your candle clear may shine.
Continuing from six to nine,
That honest men that walk along *>.j
May see to pass safe without wrong.
It is beyond our comprehension anl
imagination in these days of flaming
arc lamps and brilliantly lighted
streets to picture the streets of Lon
don in the lawless age when only a
candle with a cotton wick was hung
out here and there ou dark nights. It
was au age of lanthorns, of flambeaux
and llnkboys, when every one mado
his will and prepared for death, when
ho ventured out at night.
It is so written that it was a com
mon practice In that city for a com
pauy of a hundred or more to make
nightly invasions upon houses of tho
wealthy to kill and rob, and it Is re
corded "that when night was come no
man durst venture to walk in the
streets."— Springfield Union. |
A Rattlesnake Story.
In "Life and Sport on the raclflc
Coast" Horace A. Vachell relates on?
of Ms narrow escapes from a friend's
bullet. "My cousin and I had been
camping and hunting for several day*
in ii sort of paradise valley. One day
during ii long ride on horseback we
had seen a great many rattlesnake*
and killed a few. an exceptional ex
perience. That night my cousin wolie
up anil saw by the llgiii of the mooD
a big rattler crawling across my chest.
He lay for a moment fascinated, hor
ror struck, watching the sinuous curves
of the reptile. Then he quietly reach
ed for his six shooter, but he could not
see the reptile's head, and he moved
nearer, noiselessly, yet quickty, dread
ing some movement on my part that
should precipitate the very thing be
dreaded, and then he saw that It was
not a snake at all—only the black and
yellow stripe of my blanket, which
gently rose and fell ns I breatfied.
Had he fired—well, It might have been
bad for me, for he confessed that his
hand shook."
And They Didn't Exercise.
William M. Evarts, who lived until
he was nearly ninety, said he kept hU
health by never taking exercise. The
celebrated Dr. William George Mead,
who lived to the surprising age of 11$
years, spent nearly all of bis time in
the open air and played a little golf.
Dr. Mead used to drink two or three
quarts of water every day, and perhaps
there is a suggestion in that. Old Du
bols, who lived In Canada for tho bet
ter part of 119 years on the north
shore of Lake Erie, never worked and
never took exercise. He spent seventy
five years of bis life fishing with hook
and line and ate nothing but baked ap
ples and milk and brown bread and un
salted butter. Perhaps you can live
that long If you do nothing but fish
and eat what old Dubols did. But take
notice that these long livers never ex
ercised.—New York Telegraph.

tive Manner.
So many mistakes are mode In Hip
papering of wnlls that perhnps n few
hints will not be out of plnce. n«
spring will «oon be here, when re
pairs are being Hindi 1 everywhere.
Never paper tho walls of n sinnll
room with Inrge llgnres. No mntter
how pretty they lire, »he whole effect
Is likely to lie crowded and very home
ly. If the room faces north, use n
worm tone, never n blue or n gray or
n green. Yellow Is admirable In a
dark room, nnd bright rose makes even
a plain, dronry room look rich nnd In
viting.
The fashion lv dining rooms nt pres
ent dispense* entirely with pictures.
The wnlls nre either covered with tnp
estry paper or done lv paneled effects.
Wainscoting Is very much the fashion
for those thnt can afford It.
If the chnlr covers nnd portieres nre
of figured material they require a
plain pnper, nnd vice versa. A plain
paper Is much better than a figured
one for showing off paintings aud en
gravings.
If tbe room Is very high it is a good
plan to do away with the frieze nnd to
bring tbe celling tint down on the side
wnlls nt least eighteen Inches, when
tbe molding can be placed at tbe top
of the wall paper proper.
The servants' rooms nnd the kitchen
should be pointed with a durable col
or, so that they enn be scrubbed thor
oughly with «onp nnd wnter.
It Is dangerous to trust the eye in
matters of color; therefore the sam
ples of upholstery materials should al

ASPARAGUS CULTIVATION.
How to Make a Bed of the Edible
Young Shoots.
Asparagus is a perennial berb cuitl- #
vated for Its edible young shoots. It Is
a rugged ( plant and will thrive uuder
adverse conditions, but to obtain the
succulent stalks needed for culinary
purposes well drained, rich soil Is ab
solutely necessary. The soil should dp
well mixed with rotted manures con
taining much nitrogen and potash.
Prepare the bed by plowing or spad
ing deeply, beginning the work early
and looking after the drainage prob
lem carefully. Plants at least one year
old should be obtained for this bed.
They can be raised from seed, which Is
sown outdoors In April in drills one
foot apart, the seed being covered
about one-half Inch. Plants suitable
for transplanting the following spring
may be easily j grown this way, or
roots may be obtained from one to
three years old.
Set the plants In the permanent bed
In furrows eighteen inches apart, the
plants being tbe same distance apart
in each furrow. Be careful to spread
tbe roots out naturally and set each
plant on a little mound of earth in the
furrow. Cover at first to a depth of a
few inches, gradually filling in as the
season advances. In the fall cut back
all tbe stocks to a level with the
ground for the winter.
In the second year loosen the soil by
shallow spading. When the first shoots
appear the rows may be hilled up
somewhat. Cut sparingly until the
third year, as the plants will be more
productlvo afterward.
How to Overcome Oily Hair.
A young woman who has tried all

er way to apply the shampoo mixture
to the scalp Is to part the Hair in

washed they should be rubbed vigor

ICOURT DECISION
Continued from Pane 1
about the matter, stated: "Well,
John's (meaning Delucchi's) face
was all over blood, and he said three
or four jumped on him out there and
was beating him. He ffot up and came
in here, and I Rave him the gun and
told him to go out and defend himself.
That Is about the mm and substance
of it."
tt is not shown by the record of the
preliminary examination that Delucchi
and Coffman had any . further , conver
sation, or that Coffman was present or
witnessed or had knowledge of the
trouble thereafter ensuing between
Delucchi and Lopez, or performed any
other act in the matter., Delucchi,
after receiving the revolver, holding it
behind him, walked out' of the hotel
and advanced toward Lopez. Upon
reaching the street, according to the
testimony of Lopez, as shown by the
record, he pointed the pistol toward
him (Lopez) and a scuffle tcok place
between them during which Delucchi
wan disarmed by Lopez. There is in
the record no evidence from any other
witness that Delucchi was seen to
point the gun at Lopez.
The proposition arising from the re
cord of the preliminary examination
is this: Can one who has simply wit
nessed a part of an affray in the
street, and returned to his place of
business, and thereafter sees one of
the participants (with whom it may
be inferred that he is on some terms
of intimacy) appear inside his place
of business with his face covered
with blood, complaining that three or
four have jumped on him and were
beating him, be held to answer as
an accomplice in an assault thereafter
committed by such participant when
the only action and advice of the one
so witnessing is to hand a revolver to
such participant and tell him to go
out and defend himself.
Banishing from the mind the resent
ment that arises from the imprudent
and censurable act of arming a man
with a gun, who has just been worsted
in an encounter, to ask the foregoing
question Is to answer it. _ ■ '
In the administration of justice, cer
tain general principles of .law must be
followed, regardless of • the fact
whether the guilty may or may not
go unpunished in a particular case
(by this I am not assuming that the
defendant may have done something
not appearing in the evidence taken
down at the preliminary examination,)
that would have made him? guilty of
any crime whatever, and stating the
principle or rule involved in this case,
let it be'supposed, for example, that
Amador City had been ■ deserted dur
ing this trouble save . and excepting
for the presence of Delucchi, Coffman
and Lopez ; that after handing the re
volver to Deluichi with the. advice
and instruction to go out and defend
himself, Coffman had beheld Delucchi
creep up behind Lopez and administer
a fatal blow.
Now, by the express provision of
section 1111 of our penal code a con
viction cannot by had on the testimony
of an accomplice, without other testi
mony tending to connect the defendant
with the commisson of the offense.
If this defendant can be held, upon
this record taken at the preliminary
examination to be an accomplice and
guilty of an assault of any degree
perpetrated by Delucchi, then here is
an absolute demonstration that had
there been a foul murder committed
by Delucchi under circumstances above
mentioned, no conviction of any crime
■whatever could have been had. against
him. notwithstanding the positive
evidence of Coffman.
The absurdity of calling Coffman an
accomplice and holding his evidence to
tie insufficient to sustain a verdict of
conviction against Delucchi in a sup
posed murder committed as above il
lustrated is apparent and yet it is
but the natural and logical conclusion
that follows in an endeavor to charge
Coffman as an accomplice in an assault
perpetrated by Delucchi as set forth
in the record of the preliminary ex
amination. It is a poor rule that does
not work both ways, but the rule is
the same for ascertaining what, con
stitutes an accomplice, whether in its
application 'to diversifying state of
circumstances it be invoked in a given
rase either by ihe prosecution or by a
defendant charged with crime.
Z Section 31 of our penal code, which
is but declaratory of the common law
rule, provides that to make one guilty
who himself does not directly commit
the crime, that is, what is known as
an accessor— First, he must aid and
abet it, or second, not being present
has advised and encouraged its com
mission. In the line of decisions
where the question has been raised as
what constitutes an accomplice, there
is not a single break, each and all
declare that to be an accessory one
must, if present, both aid and abet,
or, if not present, have advised and
encouraged the commission of the
crime.' • ■ • ' ■
nil not "claimed by the prosecu
tion that the acts and conduct of Coff
man brought him within the first
class, that is. that he was present and
did aid «nd abet in the commission of|
the crime;' fdr th«* single physical act
performed by him was the one handing
the revolver to Delucchi. But it Is
claimed that his conduct and language
bring him within the second class,
that is, by the use of the language,
"Take this nnd go out' and defend
yourself," and the physical act of
handing the revolver to Delucchi.
By what process of reasoning it can
be held that to tell a man to defend
himself Is advising him to commit a
crime, 1 am wholly unable to fathom.
It is the advice given to the average
American boy by his father; and while
under our statute the giving of such
advice to, accompanied by the act of
arming, a child under the age of four
teen years, or a 1a 1 lunatic or idiot, would
undoubtedly make the offender an ac
complice in any act of assault com
mitted by such child, lunatic or idiot,
it is not claimed here that Delucchi
comes within one of these classes.
To advise a man to "go out and de
fend himself" is not advising him to
commit a crime, but it is telling him
to do something that he has a lawful
right' to do, even to the extent of tak
ing human life under some circum
stances, if it becomes necessary.
The elementary principle of law as
laid down in Greenleaf on Evidence, a
standard text book in almost every
law school in the land, is thus stated
in volume 3, .at page 71: "If the prin
cipal in the; crime totally and sub
stantially departs from his instruc
tions, as if, being solicited to burn ; a
house, he moreover commits a robbery
while so doing, he stands single, in
the latter crime while so- doing, and
the other is not held responsible for
the robbery as an accomplice."
That Delucchi totally and substan
tially departed from his instructions
"to go out and defend himself." 'by
committing an assault instead, is es
tablished beyond the shadow of , a
doubt, The advice ''to take 'the gun
and go out and defend himself" was
lawful and innocent in itself; but sup
pose'he had given some unlawful ad
vice, for example; to take the revolver
and go out and ' break open a till in
another man's house and burglarize it,
and departing from such instructions
Delucchi had committed an assault
upon the street upon Lopez, .yet even
then, under "this elementary rule of
law, Coffman could not be held as an
accomplice to tne assault. In other
words, to hold Coffman as an accom
pice, in any assault committed by De
lucchi, It must appear that he; advised
an assault, or used ' language from
Which a reasonable deduction might be
drawn from the language itself that
such advice was so understood by the
parties, and that no innocent construc
tion could he reasonably be placed upon
the language used.
' The rule laid down in Greenleaf on
Evidence has never % been changed in
this "state!". In People vs Keefer, 65
Cal. 233, it is said : "The fact that the
defendant did encourage Chapman in
his purpose to follow and tie the de
ceased, such encouragement would not
of itself make j him accessory to the
killing." In People vs." Bunker, 2
gal. App. Reports, 204, it was held
'-'that even if Granger and Tichenor
were guilty of offering a bribe," to
Bunkers, a member of the legislature,
they were not accomplices in the crime
of Bunkers in receiving a bribe , while
a member of the legislature," and the
conviction of Bunkers was rightfully
had on their testimony, as they
neither aided nor abetted nor en
couraged the crime of receiving a
bribe, for which he was convicted, by
their acts in procuring the money and
giving it to Jordan, who offered the
bribe."
A multitude of authorities upon
this principle underlying the acts and
words that are necessary to make one
an accomplice may be found. Some of
the California cases that may be
mentioned, to say nothing of the
authorities from our sister states are :
People v. Anthony, 56 Cal. 395.
People v. Balinger, 71 Cal 20.
People v. Dole, 122 Cal. 436.
People v. Compton, 123 Cal. 412.
People v. Morine, 133 Cal. 627.
Feople v. Blackwell, 143 Cal. 259.
People v. Lang, 7 Cal. App. Rep.
727. '1 '■■ «r;.,.M.|..
No cases have been cited by the dis
trict attorney, and in my opinion no
case can be found that will justify
the holding of this deferdant upon
any crime of assault committed by
Delucchi upon the evidence taken at
the preliminary examination. But it
is suggested with much plausibility
but much assurance, that Coffman is
morally responsible for the act of De
lucchi, and the latter would have com
mitted his offense if Coffman had not
furnished him with a revolver, and he
should be held amenable for the act of
Delucchi; but neither would any man
ever kill another by poison or a gun if
some one did not sell or furnish the
gun or poison to him. Inasmuch as no
judge, acting upon his oath ot office,
could permit a verdict to stand, as
suming that one would be rendered,
against Coffman for the crime of as
sault of any degree committed by De
lucchi, it would aeem that the
punishment for Coffman's delinquency
would fall upon the tax-payers who
must beat the expense of a criminal
trial, rather than upon him. Couits
are organized for the purpose of re
dressing legal wrongs only, and how
ever reprehensible and censurable the
conduct of a man may be in the eyes of
the community, , so long as he con
fines it within legal bounds he Ih not
answerable to the courts, but amend
able only to a power higher than that
of man; and this is necessarily so in a
free government wheie no man can be
convicted except upon the Identical
charge upon which ho is placed on
trial, for if there is to be a departure
from this rule, the necessity for the
classification of crimes no* longer ex
ists, and the legal conduct of all men
would be regulated not by written
laws but by the conscience of the
judge.
The conclusion is Irresistable that
the evidence appearing in - the record
taken before the committing magis
trate is Insufficient to justify the com
mittment of defendant for offense of
an assault by Delucchi of any degree
whatever; that the restraint of de
fendant's liberty is illegal, and that he
is entitled to his discharge upon
habeas corpus.

COOKS' SHOPS.
■•-::■ :■ /—■■■ .-;. - ■
They Were the Beginnings of th«
Modern . Restaurant.
In primitive times tbe only places
hi London where. the public could be
entertained wltb " food had been the
cooks' shops. The famous ICast Cheap
was a great thoroughfare, down which
the. stalls of the butchers alternated
with those of the cooks. You chose a
Joint at the flesh market, and you car
ried, it next door to be cooked for
you by a certain hour. If you wished
for ... wine, you must bring that with
you.' for the cooks sold no liquor, al
though they seem to have provided, as
time went on, more and more of the
natural accompaniments of meat, such
as bread, vegetables and, pastry.
.This habit continued until well Into
the 'reign of Elizabeth, and so . long
as such, an inconvenient custom pre
vailed ; there could have been.no real
comfort for any citizen who chose .to
dine ' abroad. He must have had . as
much trouble with porterage and bas
kets aa a country; party i has today nt
a. picnic. But about the time that
Shakespeare came up to London ; a
remarkable change took place In the
customs of the town, and the practice
of . . public hospitality and - entertain
ment i was singularly facilitated. . < ■
• The nature of this change lay in tbe
sudden development of tbe tavern and
the - consequent withdrawal- of. the
cookshop. The worshipful company
of pastelars, as the cooks were called,
ceased to enjoy the. monopoly of pro
viding hot meals.— Edmund Gosse In
Harper's Magazine. . '■'■ •
Railroads Are Never Finished.
In one respect a railroad is unlike
any. other project undertaken by man
—It Is never finished. Like a cucumber
vine, says a writer in Popular Me
chanics, the instant It ceases to grow
It begins to wither. There must be
continuous expansion and enlargement.
Larger cars require more powerful lo
comotives, , and both in turn call for
heavier :. rails, bigger roundhouses,
stronger bridges, longer platforms and
sidings. Increased safety devices, while
the straightening of curves and the
leveling of grades come In for tbeir
share of attention on even the oldest
roads. Little wonder, then, with our
railroads consuming nearly one-half of
all 'our manufactured steel and Iron
and fully one-half of all the lumber
made each year, that they are the. un
failing barometer or the business ac
tivity of the nation.
The Wonders of Science.
It was left for the exhibitor of a
phonograph In the; 'streets of Utrecht,
according to an American traveler, to
put the finishing touch to the wonder
ful Invention. There was the sound of
a military band In full blast, and then
suddenly the tune stopped and "Bait!"
rang hoarsely out upon the air.
"Who's that Interrupting the con
cert?" flippantly inquired the Ameri
can, edging close to the operator.
"That," said the man, surveying him
blandly, "was the voice of Napoleon
Bonaparte giving the order at the bat
tle of Waterloo."
