They tell this story down on Wall

insurance company, happening one
day to meet a friend in the street
found himself violently upbraided be
cause his company refused to invest
in the bonds of an enterprise with
which his friend was connected. -,7, 7

were ordering a box of, a new brand
of cigars, "OL, well, send me up a mil

"So thuj/s the way the land lies, is
it?' asked Ivy Lyle. h . ' V
The sensitive face under the big, rose
tned sun hat was very white. Her
tfps quivered a little. The hands that
beld the vagrant sheet trembled.
"It isn't that I care!" she told her
self. "I hadn't begun to care — in that
way. I was only becoming — attracted.
But the shock— the disillusion"—
When she had started out an hour
ugo for her usual brisk morning walk
along, the crisp, shelving j sands, she
had been one of the most indifferent,
light hearted of girls. She was done
with college] and the two years of for
eign travel had succeeded school as a
sort of polishing process. She had per
fect health and misty dreams of all
the veiled future held in its keeping.
She had aesthetic tastes, and her skill
In athletic sports was the admiration
of her less vigorous girl friends. She
had been having a beautiful time down
at this gay, uucouveutioual resort on
tho Michigan const. And now — well,
temporarily it seemed that her pleas
ure was spoiled.
And in her heart she knew that she
must have been beginning to think too
much of the man whose attentions to
her had been so marked or else this
discovery would not so. affect her. Sit
ting to rest and watch the white crest
ed waves come curling up to break on
the border of the lake like threads of
rarest lace, her attention had been
caught by a small, white, whirling ob
ject that at first sight she had taken
for a bird. It had .whisked lower and
nearer. Then it floated so close she
could put out her hand and grasp it,
and she found it was a sheet of note
paper covered with diminutive chirog
raphy. It was written on the station
ery of the fashionable hotel looming
up on the dunes behind her. At first
she had been about to crumple it up
and cast it aside, but in the very act
of doing so a name — her own name —
met her eye.
Even then she hesitated. But the
three words were so significant she
must know their writer's full mean
ing. The page was the continuation
of a letter, and the first three words
at the top of the page were "love
Ivy Lyle!" Impulsively, giving her
self no chance to -weigh the niceties of
honor in the balance, she scanned the
page. As she read it slowly again the
fresh, soft color went tiding qu{; of
her cheek.
"Love Ivy Lyle. I've fought against
it, for I can't afford to marry her, as
you know. But she has rather swept
me off my feet, old chap. At first I

You know what these warm weather
flirtations amount to. So I've been go

swimming and boating and all the rest
of it, and, by Jove, for all she's
piighty quiet, I've come to find bu'f
she's hot 'the typical little country girl
at all. She's well read and traveled,
though she seemed rather aghast when
she let that fact out. And she looks at
a fellow in a cool, apprising sort of
way that makes him feel pretty cheap
if his spoken thoughts are not quite up
to her white standard. But she's not
really in the social swim. She's a na
tive, I take it. It's been hard to pin
her down to any confidence about her
self. Sli£ lives with a very dragon of
an aunt at a farmhouse on the edge of
town. She wears her cotton dresses
and shade hats in a way that takes
the shine out of the women up at the
hotel, but I've never seen her sport

And she's the girl the heads of both
our houses expect me to marry. She
may have the good taste to refuse me,
and I almost hope she will. She's a
great heiress, and the consolidation of

it would be so hard to get that little
girl's sweet face out of my heart. I

sorry for those poor devils of kings

It needed no signature. The writer
was easily recognized. She crumpled
the paper tightly in her hand and
thrust it into the blouse of her gown
as a rapid, heavy step came crunching
flown the beach. That step had be
come too pleasantly familiar. Could
he have known the sheet had been
whisked out of his room? Had he
seen it blown down to the beach?
"Good morning, Miss Lyle!" He
flung himself down beside her. His
handsome, boyish face looked strained
and set, as though Insomnia had
claimed iilm. "You're out early. Will
you go rowing with me today up to
Clear Springs?"
"I— l can'tl" she faltered.
The pleading voice had become so
perilously dear to her she found it
hard to refuse. Something strange In

her tone made him look up quickly,
and he saw how pale she was.
"You "are ill?" he cried sharply.
"What is It? What Is wrong?" ..
There was no doubt of the sincere
concern in' his eyes.
"It is nothing!" Pride came to her
aid. She rose. "I must go home."
"And won't you come up Black river
today?" entreatlngly, almost tenderly.
"It may be the last time!"
He was planning— planning. . Oh,
that cruel, cruel letter! But— the last
time, he had said.
; She flung up her head and smiled at
him. "Yes, I will go!" she said.
They were very gay that afternoon,
almost recklessly so. They had lunch
eon at the inn near the springs and
floated back between the wooded banks.
Just as the -day was closing. When'
they came to parting at the clump of
lilac bushes in the lane that led to the
farmhouse Jack Ardsley -leaned for
ward and looked into her eyes.
"Dear,'.', he said, "I love you! I love
you, find I can't let you go out of my
life— ever! You don't know much of
me, Ivy, but— will you be my wife?"
"What," she faltered, "what about
Damarls Chase?" '
He took her shaking hands and held
them fast.
"Who in the world has been telling
you of her? I've never seen her, but
our fathers have vast interests in com
mon and have been anxious to arrange
a match. I don't say I didn't think of
being complaisant. Darling, some time
I may get up courage to tell you how
near I came to being a paltry coward,
how desperately I tried to make myself
think I could do without you. But 1
cannot, and that's all there is to It. If
you can endure being poor with me for
a few years I'll work so hard at my
profession to give you everything that
I shall be sure to win." ';\' '.
She bad not been mistaken in letting
herself love him, then! For she did
love him— she did. And she had known
it all the while. She lifted her shy,
flushed face.
"I will be a good wife to you, dear!"
she promised. And he kissed her on
the lips.

the dance at the inn he stood amazed.

Tricks of Ancient Gold Workers.
There is a papyrus which gives
recipes for various alloys used in the
manufacture of cups and vases, for
making gold and silver ink, for gilding
and silvering and for testing the purity
of precious metals. Other recipes

by adding baser metals— an operation

mass of the gold and silver was dou

changed, and, as the compiler of the
manual remarks, a skilled workman
would find it difficult or even Impos
sible to detect the fraud. The recipes
which recur most frequently describe,
various modes qf preparing asem,' a
word which originally meant a naturaj
pljoy of gold and silver known to the
Greeks as electrum. It was at first

considered sacred to Jupiter and was

origin of alchemy. Both gold and
silver could be extracted from genuine
asem, and it seemed as though it could
be changed at the will of the operator
into' either one or the other. It could
also be made artificially by mingling
gold and silver, or closely imitated by
some of the numerous alloys, eleven or
twelve varieties of which are describ

Among the candidates for appoint

A friend set Murphy in a fiiir, round
hand to copy "Patrick Murphy and
kept him practicing at it assiduously.
When the eventful day arrived, "Take

pen exclamations arose: "Pat's a-writ

HOBO STEW.
ft. CiiUnury Triumph That Is Dear to
tbe Tranip.
The'professional hobo generally trav
els and operates alone, but if upon ar
riving at some large town or city he
hnppcns to meet other congenial mem
bers of his profession a pooling of in
terests is sometimes undertaken, a ho
bo camp set up, and the. town is sys
tematically worked. - The spot or a
camp usually chosen is in the outskirts
on some wooded tract not too far from
the railroad. Here the profits are di
vided and -the different territories al
lotted.; At nightfall all congregate to
this point with the spoils and supplies,
and over the "hobo stew^. incidents of
the day are discussed^'Hobo stew" la

and, in fact, everything edible that has

vory mess is sufficiently boiled it Is
eaten with much gusto by the tramp.
' These camps are never kept in exist
ence long, however, because the hobo
realizes that the danger of detection
nnd a roundup is an ever present one
when 11 large number remain long to
gether in any one camp. Professional

FRUIT MYSTERIES.
The Baaoot Is Seedless, Though No-
body Knows Why.
The banana is seedless, or nearly so,
and has been for centuries, though
nobody knows why. It is propagated
by suckers and possibly had no seeds
when it was first found in its wild
state. The banana is a modified berry.
Cutting the fruit through the middle
you will sometimes see a few little
brown spots, which are the rudimen
tary seeds. Occasionally the banana
does actually produce a few seeds.
The pineapple is seedless, being prop
agated likewise from suckers and from
slips. The eggplant, which is a fruit,
botanically speaking, is occasionally
seedless. ' This plant Is able to pro
duce developed fruit whether the blos
som Is fertilized or not. Horticultur
ists are endeavoring at the same time
to rid fruit plants of thorns. Some
oranges and lemons are very thorny —
for example, the high priced King
orange, which is the best of the man
darins. The first trees were brought
to the United States from Cochin Chi
na. In Florida its thorniness has been
reduced by selecting buds from the
branches with the fewest thorns.
Thorns are objectionable because they
puncture the oranges and lemons
when the branches are blown about
by the wind. Efforts are being made
to get rid of the thorns on raspberry
nnd blackberry plants simply for con
venience In picking the fruit. The
thorns are meant by nature to protect
the plant from animals. Cultivators
select those plants which happen to
be thornless or nearly so.
Laugh.
Learn to laugh. A good laugh Is bet
ter than medicine. Learn how to tell a
story. A well told story Is as welcome
as a sunbeam In a sickroom. Learn to
keep your own troubles to yourself.
The world is too busy to care for your
ills and sorrows. Learn to stop croak
ing. If you cannot see any good In the
world keep the bad to yourself. Learn
to hide your pains and aches under a
pleasant smile. Nq one cares to. hear
whether you have the earache, head
ache or rheumatism, Don't cry. Tears
do well enough in novels, but they are
out of place in real life. Learn to meet
your friends with a smile. The good
humored man or woman is always wel
come, but the dyspeptic or hypochon
driac is not wanted anywhere and Is a
nuisance as well.
Gorgeous Japanese Robes.
In number the diaphanous robes
worn by a Japanese woman of high
rank of the eleventh or twelfth cen
tury were seldom less than twenty,
while on great occasions even more
might be necessary. Thus at a great
palace fete it is said that "some wore
as many as twenty-five suits., showing
glimpses of purple," of crimson, of grass
green, of wild rose yellow and of sapan
wood brown, their sleeves and skirts
decorated with golden designs, while
others, by subtle commingling of wil
low sprays and cherry blossoms and
by embroidered patterns picked out
with gems, represented the poem of
the jewels and the flowers."

Consumption
•I There is no specific for
consumption. Fresh air, ex-

Scott's Emulsion will come
pretty near curing it, if there
is anything to build on. Mil'
lions of people throughout the
world are living and in good
health on one lung.
From time immemorial the
doctors prescribed cod liver
oil for consumption. Of
course the patient could not
take it in its old form, hence
it did very little good. They
can take
SCOTT'S
EMULSION
and tolerate it for a long
time. There is no oil, not
excepting butter, so easily
digested and absorbed by the
system as cod liver oil in the
form of Scott's Emulsion,
and that is the reason it is so
helpful in consumption where
its use must be continuous.

CRUSTY CARLYLE.
An Anecdote Which Illustrates His
Disagreeable Disposition.
Carlyle suffered from dyspepsia and
disappointment' He was therefore nei
ther oversympathetic In intercourse
with his friends nor fair In his esti
mates of other writers.
Though he personally liked Tenny
son, he spoke with Impatience of his
"cobbling his odes," dismissed Jane
Austen's novels as "dish washings,"
Hallam, the historian, as "dry as dust"
and Goldsmith as an "Irish black
guard."
Even the writers ot editorials In the
press were saluted with this hard say-
Ing: "What are these fellows doing?
They tlnly serve to cancel one anoth
er." A characteristic anecdote Illus
trates his cruel disposition, which pro
voked him to inflict pain even on a
friend.
. An artist who frequented Carlyle's
house painted a picture of him in bis
dressing gown smoking a pipe by the
fireside and Mrs. Carlyle In an arm
chair sitting opposite him. The pic
ture was hung at one of the Royal
academy's exhibitions and, though not
a striking work of art, was purchased
by Lord - Ashburton, Carlyle's friend,
forfoOO. ■, •'.' V. -;
The delighted artist hurried off to
the Carlyles, expecting congratulations
on the sale and some manifestation of
pleasure on their part at having such
a value set on a picture of themselves
and their domestic interior. He deliv
ered bis glad tidings, but all the re
sponse he' received from Carlyle was:
"Well, In my opinion, £500 was just
£405 too much,"
When to Exercise.
When to exercise is an important
consideration. If the morning only Is
available the exercise should be light.
Particularly is this the case if one is
engaged In any work. The supply of
energy must not be drawn from at the
beginning of the day. The afternoon
is perhaps the best time for exercise,
when one has gained strength from
the absorption of the morning and
poon meals. Those who exercise vigor
ously at 'night should eat a midday
dinner. Exercise should always pre
cede bathing and not, as a rule, follow
It In this respect the ancient Greeks
showed great wisdom. Exercise and
bathing they called the two pillars of
strength. Exercise was Hercules and
bathing Apollo. Both were regarded
with equal importance, and neither
was complete without the other.'

"Couldn't find Moscow? And I'd

I remember hearing tell of Moscow be

tions to children what's there to learn

AFFECTION IN JAPAN.
It . la Deep '■ and Lasting, but, as a
Rule, Not Outspoken.
Public demonstration of affection is
most repugnant to the good taste of
the Japanese, and it is the absence of
this which is so generally mistaken
for a lack of genuine feeling. I recali
one man who was so devoted to his
mother -(though I doubt whether be
could . ever have been said to have
"talked about" her) that when she died,
while he was abroad, his depression
was so profound that my husband
watched him. with anxiety lest bo.
should commit suicide. The stoical
training may - render \ more unsympa
thetic a coarse nature, but repression
to the refined soul brings an exquisite
capacity for, pain scarcely conceivable
by those who are free to give utter
ance to every emotion.
Another man said . to • me, "I rarely
speak of my mother, for a foreigner
does not understand that a Japanese
mother may be just as dear to her son
as his to him and by the Japanese It
is not expected that one should utter
one's deepest feeling." That same
son fainted with grief when his moth

cause. ' To this day, whenever he goes
from home, he carries with | him his

THE JAPANESE-RUSSIAN WAR.
The war between Japan and Russia
may be a long way from flnal settle
ment. It has emphasized one thing
—namely, that a new world-power
in tbe orient must hereafter be rec
koned within the treatment of ques
tions dealing with matters in the
Far East. Until very recent his
tory Japan — with her under-sized
people — has been deemed of no con
sequence from a military and naval
standpoint. Allied to the Mongolian
hordes of ". China, whose military
prowess has been demonstrated to
cut little figure, in spite of over
shadowing numbers, the Japanese
have been classed on the same low
estimate as regards patriotism and
military valor with their neighbors
of the main land. At the outset of
the present war, the consensus of
opinion held the Japanese govern
ment — notwithstanding the admit-
tedly just grounds for complaint
against the encroachments of the
Northern Bear — to be reckless in
- deed to attempt to measure swords
with Russia. In numbers, in finan
cial resources, and in military pres
tige, the dwarfish islanders were
looked upon as hopelessly outclassed,
and destined to fall an easy prey
both on land and sea before the war
riors of the Czar, Russia has paraded
before the world for generations as
an unconquered and unconquerable
nation. Her mission is to extend
the map of Russia until it embraces
the whole or the better portions of
both Europe and Asia. Unceasingly
she has pushed her frontiers in every
direction with that end in view. The
menace of Japan by the insidious
occupation' of Manchuria, and the
advance upon the Korean peninsula,
was deliberately taken in accordance
with this well-defined policy. What
temerity for Japan single-handed to
call a halt on this strutting and self
proclaimed boss of the world. It
was like a pigmy talking fight to a
giant. The war has been in progress
for nearly a year, and although still
undecided, it has proved a revela
tion on both sides. It has shown
Russia as an over-grown effete
bully — big merely in territory and
numbers, but wofully lacking in
' naval and military preparation. On
the other hand Japan has fully es
tablished her claim to naval and
military supremacy. Russia's navy
in the far east — at the opening of the
war supposed to be the strongest in
that part of the world — has been
utterly destroyed. One lone cruiser
. remains in fighting trim. The Baltic
_^-<fieet in two squadrons is in route to
the seat of war for the purpose of re
storing Russia's naval prestige, and
there is hardly a doubt that it will
meet with disastrous defeat at the
hands of Toga and Kamimura. On
land the Japs have been equally suc
cessful. They have driven the Rus
sians hundreds of miles into the
interior of Manchuria. Excepting
Port Arthur, the Russians do not
hold any disputed sea coast terri
tory on the Pacific. That strong
hold — doubtless the strongest ever
subjected to the test of modern im
plements of war — is practically in
the hands of the brown 'warriors of
Japan. Its surrender is simply a
question of time. When that event
takes place. the humiliation of Russia
will be complete. Her cup of bitter
ness will be full to overflowing — a
righteous outcome of the game of
duplicity and braggadocio she has
played among the nations for hun
dreds of years.
But what will be the effect upon
Japan? Will she bear the honors of
war becomingly, or will she .too be
come puffed up with her new-found
importance? Will the nations of the
east doff the war paint, under the
stimulus of the successes of the
island kingdom? In placing a veto
upon the inroads of the Slav peril,
has Japan conjured up another and
perhaps greater evil— the yellow
peril? Will the outcome of this
struggle between the Occident and
the orieut work for the weal or woe
UNION SCHOOL LAW.
The agitation in the northern por
tion of the county for the consolida
tion of a number of school districts
into one strong union school, with
Plymouth as its center, seems to us
a step in the right direction. The
last state legislature passed a law
providing that a number of school
districts may unite to form a union
grammar school, providing for the
transportation of pupils living at a
distance to and from school at the
expense of the school funds. The
people are extremely sensitive on
educational . matters. An opinion
prevails that we have reached the
pinnacle of efficiency in our provision
for the education of the rising gen
eration; that our system is incapable
of improvement, except in the direc
tion of providing more money to be
spent for more schools, or larger sal
aries for the teachers. The idea of
retrenchment is tabooed/ as a move
of a retrogade character. While
no one is prepared to advocate a
niggardly policy in educational
facilities, still there are many who
believe that better results ought to
be attained from the vast expendi
tures of money now demanded annu
ally to support the common schools
of the state. We have aimed to
place a school house almost at the
door of every family having children
of school age. In thinly settled dis
tricts it is inevitable to have small
ungraded schools. But the policy
of multiplication of school houses
has been pressed in the vicinity of
the centers of population, and" many
think to the injury of the cause, of
education. It is a common occur
rence to find a teacher employed to
instruct a school with less than an
average daily attendance of ten
scholars. These pupils are of all
ages, between six and sixteen, and
consequently there is little scope for
the working of that spirit of emula
tion between children of the same
age. In a graded school a teacher
is better able to take charge of a
class of thirty or forty pupils, than
a class of ten in an ungraded school.
In a number of eastern and middle
west states the system of consoli
dating a number of weak rural
schools into one strong central
school has been tried, and the re
sults have proved so satisfactory
from every view point that the cen
tralization plan is rapidly extending.
Instead of taking the school to the
outlying farm houses, the plan. of
conveying the children from the
farms to the school and back to their
homes is the policy now proposed.
Around Plymouth, for instance,
there are five or six small ungraded
schools within a radius of four or
five miles. It is a struggle to main
tain an eight months' school. By
the union plan these schools may be
consolidated, the rural schools sur
rendering their organization and
•uniting with the central school at
Plymouth, thereby forming a school
of over 400 pupils. Contracts might
be entered into for the conveyance of
pupils living in the remote parts of
the district to and from the school.
A number of contracts for convey
ance would be necessary to accom
modate the children living in differ
ent directions. The cost of convey
ance would be more than offset by
the ■ reduction in the number of
teachers employed and the expense
of maintaining so many school build
ings. Experience has demonstrated
that the plan is eminently "satis
factory from both an economical and
educational standpoint. The out
come in the Plymouth district will
be watched with much interest in
other sections of Amador county,
where the consolidation plan is con
sidered both practicable aud de
sirable.
PROPOSED TAX ON SWEET WINES
The commissioner of internal rev
enue recommends that a tax be
placed upon brandy used in the
fortification of sweet wines. The
tax is intended to provide a revenue
of at least one million dollars annu
ally from this source. It is reported
that the rate suggested is five cents
per gallon of the wine product.
Every section of California will be
hard hit if such a proposition is' em
bodied in the law. California is by
all odds the heaviest wine producing
state in the union. Over one half the
total product of the United States is
supplied from California. The indus
try has grown to be a very important
one. In Amador county the wine
grape industry has struggled along,
and at the present time has reached
a profitable basis, and is" steadily
growing. The proposed tax will
seriously cripple, if not absolutely
ruin it. We have received from the
secretary of California Viticultural
Club copies of a memorial to our
representatives in congress, urging
them to do their utmost to defeat
the proposed tax. The wine growers
are urged to hold meetings in their
respective localities, and adopt reso
lutions in opposition to this measure.
As congress adjourns in March, there
is no time to lose. Copies of the
memorial may be had at the Ledger
office, and all the wine growers have
to do is to hold a meeting and ap
point a president and secretary to
sign the protest. Let the wine men
act promptly, and do what they can
to avert a crushing blow to a very
promising industry in this county.

For many years it has been supposed that
Catarrh of tho Stomach caused indigestion

peated attacks of Indigestion inflames tho
mucous membranes linlnst the stomach and
exposes the nerves of the stomach, thus caus-
ing the glands to secrete mucln initead of
the juices of natural digestion. Thla la
called Catarrh of the Stomach.

City Pharmacy, Jackson.
Residents of cities of more than
25,000 population live at least three
and one-half years longer than those
in the country. This fact has been
disclosed by the experts at the cen
sus bureau. It is not, as might be
inferred, the arising on cold winter
mornings to build fires and milk ten
head of cows that; kill country peo
ple. They naturally live longer in
the cities than -I in the country.
Dwellers in large cities take all sorts
of chances of being killed by trolly
cars, but the census office experts
have figured out that few meet death
that way. The median age of the
country's population, was 15.97 years
one hundred years ago; in 1900 it
had increased to 22.85 years. The
increase is at the rate of about two
thirds of a year each decade. -Nearly
one-fourih of the population of the
United States are less than 10 years
old, and more than three-sevenths
less than 20 years old. Less than
one-seventh have lived fifty years,
and only twenty-three out fit every
1,000 persons have lived the allotted
seventy years. Children less than
one year old contribute 2.5 per cent
of the aggregate population, while
children under 5 years constitute
12.2 per cent. The percentage of
children under one year old in the
population varies from one to thirty
in Utah, to one' to sixty in Cali
fornia. There are fewer children in
New England and on the Pacific
coast than anywhere else in the
United States. " Three-fifths of the
American population are in what is
known as the "productive age"
group, whose ages . are between 15
and 60 years. The government has
firmly established the fact that
women "fib" about their ages. This
tendency is strongest in negroes and
foreign born" women, but nearly all
insist on underestimating their age.
The number of centenarians is grossly
exaggerated, according to the bul
letin, the exaggeration being es
pecially marked in the illiterate
classes. — Atchison Globe.

AMADOR CITY.
Early Monday morning Amador City
came unpleasantly close to a sweeping
conflagration. About half past four
that morning Frank Logamarsino, the
butcher at Culbert's shop, entered the
business place for the purpose of open
ing up for the day's doings. He went
to turn on the electric light, when in
stantly there was a pyroteenic display
of tho genuine article such as he had
never before witnessed, much less felt.
He was knocked down by the force of
the current. Others rushed in, and
made an investigation of the premises.
It was found that a large hole had been
burned in the door of the refrigerator
room, also in the floor. The fire was
still burning. Buckets were called into
requisition, and water thrown upon the
fire. This was also found to bo a haz
ardous business, as water boing an ex
cellent conductor of electricity the fire
fighters were jolted with tho current.
In other parts of the town persons
were shocked in attempting to turn on
the incandescent lamps. It was finally
discovered that tho light wires had
been . crossed and thereby short
circuited. It required the services of
an expert electrician from the Key
stone to tackle the job of parting thejn.
The fire was discovered in the nick of
time. Luckily, no one was seriously
hurt, and tho damage ia slight.
Amador Ball.
The masquerade . ball given by the
Amador union on Xmas eve was one of
the most pleasant social gatherings
ever witnessed in the town. The com
mittee in charge worked incessantly
from the day of their selection until
the orchestra ceased- playing on the

successfully that spectators aud dancecs
alike pronounced it the dance of all
dances over given in Taylor's hall.
Excellent music was furnished by_ four
pieces from Bower's ' orchestra " of
Stockton. Dancers were present from
all parts of the county, and although
the expenses were something near $140,
there is left a balance of about $30.
The supper furnished by John Torre
and sister was simply grand. When
over 200 . people aro fed and not one
word of complaint can be heard, every
thing must be satisfactory indeed. Mr.

Adjudged Insane.
On th a 27th of December Mrs. Cathe
rine B-fflngton was brought over from
Sutter i. ale by constable Tuttle to be
examined for insanity. The unfor
tunate lady has been a resident of Sut
ter Creek for over 50 years. She is a
widow, and 80 years of age. With in
creasing ill-bealth from the infirmities
of age. her mind has become impaired.
She was examined by Drs. Gall and
Endicott on Wednesday, and pro
nounced in«nne. It was intended not to
take her to tho asylum at oace, as her
state of health is such that it was deem
ed advisable to have her cared for at the
county hospital for a few days. At the
hospital, however, she was so violent
and dangerous, attacking everyone
within her reach, that it was out of the
question to care for her there.
On the 27th instant constable Kelly
brought up from lone a man named
Pat Brady, to be examined for insanity.
Ho is a stranger in the county, 44 years
of ago. He was examined on the 28th,
and committed to the asylum at Stock
ton. ■It was very evident that he was
off mentally. A voin of comedy waa
introduced into the examination, which
serves to show how cute in some ways
persons of unbalanced .minds may be.
Brady was asked: •'Didn't you tell me
in the hospital that you had had bad
luck ever since you loft the asylum."
Brady replied, with a wise glint in his
eye, "Didn't I say I had had "misfor
tune." The correction was duly made
according to the insane man's version.
Both patients were taken to Stockton
by deputy Jackson this morning.

No More Suffering.
If you ara troubled with indigestion
got a bottle of Kodol Dyspepsia Cure
and soo how quickly it will cure you.
Geo. A. Thomson, of Spencer, la., says:
"Have had Dyspepsia for twenty years.
My case was almost hopeless. Kodol
Dyspepsia Cure was recommended and
I used a few bottles of it and it is the
only thing that has relieved me. Would
not be without it. Have doctored with
local physicians and also at Chicago,
and even went to Norway with hopes
of getting some relief, but Kodol Dys
pepsia Cure is the only remedy that
has done me any good, and I heartily
recommend it. Every person suffering
with Indigestion or Dyspepsia should
U9e it." Sold by all druggists. '

Catarrh Cannot be Cured
with local applications, as they cannot
reach the seat of the disease. Catarrh.
is a blood or constitutional ; disease,
and in order to cure it you must take
internal remedies. Hall's. Catarrh
Cure is taken . internally, and acts di
rectly on the blood and mucous sur
faces. Hall's Catarrh Cure is not a
quack medicine. It was prescribed by
one of the best physicians in this coun
try for years, and is a regular prescrip
tion. It is composed of the best tonics
known, combined with the best blood
purifiers, acting directly on the mu
cous surfaces. The perfect combina
tion of the two ingredients is what
produces such wonderful results in
curing Catarrh. Send for testimon

the latter being that much higher. No

J. McGutchen, of the Shoe Store, has
created much interest in his latest
guessing contest for a $25 prize. He
bad a large wax candlo exhibited in the
window. It was 36 inches long, and
the person guessing nearest to the time
it would take to burn out was to cap
ture the prize. The difference of
opinion developed by such a contest is
astonishing. The taper was lit Sat
urday night at 6:30 o'clock. ; > It
burned out in 68 hours, 45 minutes, 7
seconds. There were ovor 4500
guesses sent in. The nearest was by
Mrs. Geo. L. Thomas, who came with
in 21 seconds of the correct time. She
secured the first prize, $25 suit. Miss B.
Taylor won second prize with tho next
nearest guess, a $5 pair of shoes. Third
prize, a handsome doll, was captured
by Mrs. Buicb. This contest created
more rivalry and interest than any
contest of the kind that has occurred
in Jackson for years.

THE AMAPOR JLEDGER; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1904.
One of the Highwaymen Captured.
Sheriff Norman on Saturday evening
brought from San Francisco Vincent
Paleti, one of luo throe n:-.-n wasi'lei! for
the hold-up of Vincenzo Moropito, near
the east shaft of tlio Kennedy mine on
December 2. It will be remembered
that Moropito came to Jackson a few
days before the robbery, bringing with
him an Italian named Maleo Valasso,
whom he had met in Sacramento, with
the other two concerned in tho robbery.
Moropito was known to have inouey,
as ho was seen to draw the $200 from
the bank, and the conspiracy was con
cocted by the trio to capture this
treasure. Vatasso came on as the ad
vance agent in the scheme, and the
other two followed the day before the
robbery occurred. Oh the 2d of De
cember the four set out from Jackson
on the plea of looking for work in the
mines. About dusk Moropita was en
ticed to a suitable spot between the
Kennedy and O.nelda, and there re
lieved of all his money, amounting, to
$180 and a nickel watch. They gener
ously left him 20 cents and bound his
hands and feet and left him on the trail,
to be cut loose by the first passenger.
The three men' having accomplished
their purpose made their escape. They
were seen at several places, at Martell's
station and in the neighborhood of
Mount Echo. They separated soon
after the crime, the short man Vatasso
taking one direction, - and his con
federates, Paletl and Cabavelo, another.
Paleti was run down in a peculiar
manner. It seems he and Casavelo
made their way to San Francisco, by
way of Stockton, and arrived at the
bay about December 7, five days after
the hold-up. They secured lodgings
on Pacific street. In the meantime de
scriptive circulars had been sent out
broadcast from the sheriff's office in
Jackson, describing the three men and
offeringa reward of $25 for theircapture.
Last week the authorities arrested a
man in San Francisco on a charge of
carrying a concealed weapon. Paleli
was with him, and the officers took
him into custody on suspicion of being
concerned in the murder of policeman
G. W. Brown of Oakland. He gave
his name as Paleti, and this caused the
officers to look up the circular sent out
by Sheriff Norman, only to find that
the description, as well as the name,
tallied with the prisoner.
The sheriff started for the city Fri
day morning, taking with him one who
had known Paleti here, and who was
able to identify him. He at once recog
nized the captive as one of the men
wanted. Paleti was thereupon turned
over to Sheriff Norman, who brought
him to Jackson and landed him in jail
Saturday night — just in time to greet
Santa Claus from a prison cell,
Paletl had only 30 cents.leftf t when ar
rested. He had togged himself out in
Stockton with a new suit of clothes,
new bat, etc. A new valise was also
In his possession, and in this was found
the old clothes he had on when the
robbery was committed.
On Sunday Paleti' was confronted
with his victim, Moropito, in the county
jail. The latter at once Identified the
prisoner as one pf the robbers, and in
excited tones accused him of taking his
money. Paleti denied that he had ever
seen him before; that seemed the only
defense loft for him. ■■ ■'■.-. "■
It is believed that Casavelo Is still
around San Francisco, and strong
hopes are entertained of landing him
with his pal Paleti before long.
Grand Jury.

jurors appeared in the suprerior court,

Mrs. Edna Peek and sister, Miss

from Oakland, to spend a few days
with relatives.
There were seven stages and accessory

with passengers bound for Jackson and

Many of the travelers were en route to

At the meeting of the state board of
dental examiners held in San Francisco
last week, Dr. C. A. Herrick of Jack
son, who has filled the position of presi
dent of the board for the past two
years, retired from that position, and
was elected secretary. Dr. F. G. Baird
of San Francisco was elected president.
Mrs. Walter Chamberlain, the "Rus
sian princess," teacher of instrumental
and vocal music, who is well-known to
the people of Sutter Creek and Jack
son, she having gained much notoriety
in both places, has recently been in
Los Angeles and Pasadena, where
creditors are mourning because of un
paid claims she has left behind. The
newspapers , state that she has been
married since she left Amador county,
about two years ago.
Jackson Rebekah degree lodge bas
presented the Odd Fellows lodge with
a handsome upright Wing piano, for
use in the new lodge room. The in
strument arrived Saturday last, und
was at once taken to its quarters iv the
upper hall. Odd Fellows hall has had
a piano right along, but the addition
of a third story' made It desirable to
have another. The old one will still
be retained in tho lower or banquet
hall, while the new one will bo for ser
vice in the regular mooting room on
the third floor.
Christmas in Jackson was the quiet
est known, for years. There was no
firing of pistols or disturbance of any
kind attending its celebration. ' For
the first time in many years there was
no grand ball or dance of 'an; kind an
nqunced for Christmas Qr New Year's
c.ye. The Native Daughters have given
a ball on New Year's eve for many
years,- but this year they allowed the
custom to lapse. Notwithstanding the
quiet holiday time from a sqcial stand
point, it has been an unusually busy
time from a business point of viow.
The stores have done a remarkably
good business.
It is understood that Fred Jackson
will retire from the position of deputy
sheriff with the commencement of the
new year. Sheriff Norman says he ij
unable to stand the expense of two
deputies, and is compelled, although
unwillingly, to part with the services pf
one. Deputy Jackson h,as made a host
of frjeqds, nqt pnly in Jackson, but
throughout the county, since he has
been Identified with the sheriff's office.
His retirement will be regretted by all.
He has been tendered a good position
out of the county, but It is rpp.qrted
that he ha.§ declined, preferring to stay
with Amador county and continue his
residence in Jackson.
The board of supervisors will meet
next Monday. The qld board will
transact business up tp the nqon hour,
wlien the newly eleqted supervisors will
assume office, and enter upon their
duties. It Is usual to elect tho senior
member of the party of the majority as
chairman. W. M. Amick, who has held
office four years and re-elected for the
ensuing term, is in l|no far. chairman
ship honors from the republican view
poitit. Supervisor Burke of Plymouth
is the senior in office on the democratic
side, with two years' service to his
credit. Neithor republican nor demo
crat can be elected on a strict party
vote. John Strohm holds the balancs
of power, as independent supervisor of
township one. Much interest therefore
attaches to the coming meeting of the
board, as it will doubtless determine
the political status of that body fqr the
next two years.
MINING NEWS
Hydraulic Mining Permits.— At
the meeting of the debris commission
to be held in San Francisco January 9,
applications for mining by the hydraulic
process will be heard from J. B. Stew
art, of the Stewart gravel mine, near
Oleta, the water from which draics
into Indian creek, and finally reaches
the Cosumnes river. . Also from the
Gold Top Mining Company, on the
Orchard placer mine, near Pine Grove,
draining into Jackson creek and the
Mokelumne river. The latter Is be
lieved to be the Wheeler placer mine,
to operate which' a company has re
cently been organized.
Argonaut— The Argonaut 40-starap
mill was started Monday last, and has
been running steadily ever since. A.
Boro, who has been in charge of the
Bunker Hill mill near Amador City,
surrendered his position there to find
employment in the same capacity at
the Argonaut, which is close to his
home in Jackson. Ernest Taylor and
Walter Taylor also • hold responsible
positions in the mill. Owing to some
of the rock in the mill having packed
solidly on account of long standing,
some inconvenience was experienced
from this cause for a day or so. The
mill Is running smoothly and satis
factory in every way. The starting up
of this mill will be hailed with much
satisfaction by the people of Jackson.
Everything indicates that a long and
profitable career of bullion production
has been entered upon. With 240
stamps in motion within a radius of two
miles, and the ad vent, of the railroad
only a question of a few months, Jack
son is bound to have a revival in busi
ness all along the line.
Struck Pay Gravel.— ln excavat
ing for the foundation of the new power
house at Electra, It is reported that the
workmen came across a rich streak of
gravel, partly in the channel of the
Mokelumne river. Some of it yielded
$3 to the pan. That neighborhood was
worked in early days, as far as the
water of tho river would permit. The
appliances to control or get rid of the
water in excavating a foundation en
abled the wqrkei-3 to get at gravel that
was unworkable by ordinary methods,
and they made a pretty good clean-up,
so it is said, outside,, of "their wages
from the Standard Electric Company.
Wildman-Mahoney.— Ten stamps
of the Wildman mill were started Mou
day on ore from the 1400 level of the
Wildman shaft. About 20 men" have
been put to work during the last week.
Tho tunnel from the Lincoln shaft at
the 1900-foot level is in about 300 feet.
This will tap the Mahonoy and Wild
man several hundred feet below, their
lowest levels, and if rich ore is en
countered in ' sufficient quantities to
justify, tho Mahoney shaft will bo sunk
to the depth of the tunnel. Superin-r
tendent Ross is said to be confident that
he will find a body of ore equal in quan
tity and richness to any on the mother
lode.
The Christmas Cantata
Over three hundred neople crowded
into the Methodist church last Friday
evening to witness the production of
the juvenile cantata, "Waiting for
Santa Claus, " by the children of the
Sabbath school. The painstaking ef
forts on the part of the superintendent,
Mrs. L. Dudeq, ably assisted by Miss
Esther Breeseand Mrs. C. E. Winning,
were more than rewarded by the chil
dren presenting as fine a program ■as
has ever been witnessed in Jackson.
About one-third of the school partici
pated in the chorus work, and as high
as fifty chilti ran were with military
precision massed, upon the platform at
one time. The juvenile performers ha.d
been so trained that there was no need
qf prompter, aqd the cantata was with
out a pause presented with a dash and
enthusiasm which delighted every
auditor. After the arrival of Old Santa,
who also had a part in the cantata, the
school proceeded to distribute to eaoh
child in th.c audience, regardless of
creed, race, color or previous condition
of servitude, a carefully prepared box
of confections. Over seventy-five
pounds of candy was. disposed Qf in
about ten mjautes— aU given to the
children— it being enough for the adults
to. see the pleasure-lit faoes of the happy
boys and girls. .It the Methodists
should give another cantata next
month it would receive a full house,
for everybody was pleased wtyh "Walt

Christmas at the County Hospital.
The inmates of the county hospital,
who had been overlooked by Santa
Claus for several years, were highly
entertained on Christmas eve by Mr.
and Mrs. LeMoin, assisted by the
neighbors and some of the inmates.
TBe large dining room was beautifully
decorated with evergreens and holly
berries, and the Christmas tree was
heavily loaded with presents and deco
rations. At 7:30 the room was com
fo.rtably filled with the inmates and
several visitors, who were highly enter
tained for an hour or sq by the hos
pital orchestra, under the leadership
of Don, Signor Gregoria Gomez, the
noted musician from Venzuela, South
America. Miss Berding-White-Bian
chetti, a prima donna from sunny Italy,
wa3 the star ballet dancer of the even
ing. She was accompanied by Johnnie
Kadacit. the Dutch comedian and man
ager of the institution. After a few
songs and recitations were rendered by
the visitors and others, Mr. Signor Joe
Lucian, the famous French juggler and
sword swallower, was next 'introduced,
who astonished the audience by swal
lowing butcher-knives, swords, ■ etc.,
without putting any grease on them.
Aftor which Santa Claus made his ap
pearance, and distributed the presents
from the tree. Every inmate in the in
stitution was remembered by him, and
they all declared that it was the most
enjoyable Christmas that they had
spent for many years, and they all wish
to extend thoir sinoore thanks to Mrs.
D. A. Patterson and others, who so
kindly contributed toward making it
one of the happiest events of their life.

_ Mrs. W. C. Johns left last Tuesday
for San Francisco for surgical treat
ment. Some time ago a fish bone
lodged in her throat. It is believed
that a portion still remains, as there is
a swelling and much difficulty in swal
lowing. She has been advised that a
surgical operation is the only way to
secure complete relief.
Mrs. Mary Askey, from San Jose,
came up last Saturday to spend the
holidays with her brother, G. W.
Brown, and family.

DIVIDING THE TIPS.
The Method That Is Followed In
Sonic London Restaurants.
, Tipping has been reduced to a very
line system in some English hotels and
restaurants. "I was sitting at meat
with the manager of one of the well
known Landon restaurants," says a
writer. "'1 am short sighted and un
observant,' I said, 'and as I never
know one waiter from another I'm al
ways uneasy lest I've tipped the wrong
one.' The manager laughed. 'Fritz,
bring the book,' he said. The book
was opened upon the table and dis
closed columns and rows of figures op
posite the nuines of waiters. Between
them the manager and Fritz explained
the system.
"Every penny given in tips was cast
into a common fund ln charge of a
waiter elected by his fellows. At the
end of the week the sum was distrib
uted. Three classes were arranged by
the manager, according to efficiency,
and the shares were ln corresponding
proportions, so that the junior who
hovers with the sauce is by no means
equally rewarded with the expert who
can advise in the matter of wine.
"Waiters keep a jealous eye on their
fellows, and the man suspected of
pocketing a tip finds his position un
tenable. The system Is good for the
public, since It diminishes the unpleas
ing personality of a charitable action.
It Is good, too, for the waiters, since
that record of the weekly gratuities
showed that the best -waiters made
about $2,000 a year ln tips."
YOUR MORNING DRAM.
Let It Be a Glass of Water and Bn.
Joy an Inside Bath.
Drink a glass of water when you get
out of bed in tbe morning. Never mind
the size of the glass. Let the water
be cold if you will. Some people pre
scribe hot water, but that isn't neces
sary. You may have washed your face
already and relished the experience.
You may have taken a cold plunge into
the tub and delighted in the shock and
its reaction. The brisk use of the tooth
brush has left your mouth clean and
the breath sweet. But you are dirty
still.
Drink a glass of cold water and en-
Joy the sensation of being clean inside.
All that is luxurious in the cold bath
cleansing the outside is artificial. That
which should prompt the glass of wa
ter after sleeping is natural.
Drink a glass of cold water in the
name of cleanliness. It becomes one
of the shortest and easiest of toilet
duties. It is swallowed in a second,
and in five minutes it has passed from
tho stomach, taking with it the clog
ging secretions of the alimentary
tracts. .It has left behind tbe stimulus
that goes with cold water, and, by fill
ing the arterial system to the normal, it
puts a spur to the circulation that has
grown sluggish in the night— Chicago
Chronicle.
THE BRIDE'S PORTION.
At One Time It Was Stated In the
Wedding Announcement.
It was a common custom ln the
eighteenth century, especially during
the reign of George 11., to insert no
tices of marriage stating the bride's
portion In contemporary periodicals
and newspapers both in England and
Scotland.
Almost every number of the Gentle
man's Magazine at that time contain
ed several of these records, of which
the following, In 1731, is a specimen:
"Married, the Revd. Mr. Roger Walua,
of York, about twenty-six year of age,
to a Lincolnshire lady, upwards of
eighty, with whom he is to have fB,
000 in money, £300 per annum, and a
coach and four, during life only."
Sometimes the notice merely de
scribes the bride as a lady with a
"good portfcm" or a "genteel fortune."
One of the latest notices was in Arts'
Birmingham Gazette, July 14, 1800,
which recorded the marriage of Mr.
Canning, undersecretary of state, to
Miss Scott, "with £100,000 fortune."—
London Telegraph.
Butterflies and Moths.
Though butterflies and moths are
found widely distributed all over the
globe they are by far most abundant
ln the tropics. For instance, Brazil can
show to the collector not less than 700
different species within an hour's walk
of Para. There are not half as many
in all Europe. In Britain- there are 67
species, and ln all Europe there are 390
different kinds. They are found as far
north as Spitsbergen, on the Alps to a
height of 9,000 feet and on the Andes
up to 18,000 feet. As there are some
200,000 species It Is easy to see why
butterfly hunters are great travelers.
An Incident of History.
Julia Ward Howe had just written
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,"
and was reading it to Elizabeth Cadiy
Stanton. .... •
"Well Lizzie," she asked when she
had finished, "what do you think of
it?"
"Great!" was the reply. "But you
are boosting man again in defiance of
our glorious principles. Sit down now
and write another to be called' "The
Battle Her of the Republic."— New
York Telegram.
No Need to Speak to Him.
"3^ow, dear." said Mr. Polkley, who
had Just been accepted, "when shall I
s^eak to your father?"
"You needn't bother," replied the
dear girl. "Pa said he'd speak to you
tomorrow if you didn't speak to me to
night."—Philadelphia Ledger.
The Bed.
The _bed is a bundle, of paradoxes.
We go*' to* it with reluctance, yet we
4uit tt with regret. We make up our
minds evei*y; night to leave it early,
but wo make up our bodies every morn
ing to keep it late.— Colton.
PUT ON THE BRAKES.
Slow Up, or Before Yon Know It Yob
May Be Oil the Track.
The limited goes sixty miles nn hour.
In the smoker men joke and play cards
and tell risque stories. The day coach

heavy sleepers as they sway to and

people who chat and read and nap.
Crash! x Engine and cars and flesh and
blood are ground up together in a
shapeless, horrid mass. Off the track!
So goes humanity's train. Here Is a
boy who got to running on a fast
gchedule. He began by pilfering from
his father's till. As he grew older he
made faster time. Down grade he
goes, and soon comes the crash. News
boys cry a murder and a suicide. The
crowd halts for a moment. His friends
murmur, "I never thought he was so
bad!" A young man Is off the track!
A young girl thinks her mother is
too slow for these record breaking
times. ' Mother Is "old fashioned." The

A. man gets in a hurry to be rich.
His father went slowly, carefully, suc
cessfully. But father's "methods will
not do. What's the use of moiling and
tolling when a quicker way may well
do the business? So-and-so has spec
ulated successfully. Surely I am as
shrewd as he. * * * A pistol shot A
mac is off the track!
Our age is a rapid one. Business and
society go at a sixty mile clip. Rather
than be sidetracked for a time men
will drive their trains Into the ditch.
Many of them run wild. ' There are
frequent collisions and wrecks innu
merable by getting off the track.
Look out, thriving but venturesome
merchant and reckless young woman
and gay young man! The race is not
to the swift alone. Put on the brakes.
Slow up, or before you know it you
will be off the track.— Milwaukee Jour
nal.

THINK OVER THESE.
Why are all cowpaths crooked? *.;
How old must a grapevine be before
It begins to bear?
What wood will bear the greatest
weight before breaking? - . '. •-
Can you tell why leaves turn upside
down just before a rain?
You can see any day a white horse,
but did you ever see a white colt?
Why does a horse eat grass back

Why does a hop vine wind one way
and a bean vine the other?
Wher-e should a chimney be the lar
ger, at the top or bottom, and why?
How many different kinds of trees
grow in your neighborhood and what
are they good for?

Escaped the "Blight Have Been."
"Yes," said the gentle optimist, "I
confess I am superstitious enough to
wear a lucky stone."
"And do you really think it gives you
luck?"
"Oh, I am quite sure of it"
"Did you have it with you yester
"Certainly."
"And in spite of It you lost a five dol
lar gold piece, tore your coat by catch
ing it on a nail, sprained your ankle
and failed to close the business deal of
which you expected so much.-''
"True," replied the gentle optimist,
"but think of what might have hap
pened to me if I hadn't had my lucky
stone." — New York Press.
Colchester's Tlmnknulvluit Pies.
Many fanny ytorles are told of the
early Thanksgiving days. The town of
Colchester, for Instance, calmly ignored
the day appointed by the governor and
held its own Thanksgiving a week lat
er, when the sloop from New York
bringing a hogshead of molasses for
pies had arrived. In Revolutionary
times Thanksgiving was not forgotten.
The council of Massachusetts recom
mended that Nov. 16, 1770, be set aside
for "acknowledgments for mercies en
joyed." In the next year Samuel Ad
ams recommended a form of Thanks
giving proclamation to the Continental
congress.
Merely Existed.
A number of lawyers were exchang
ing stories of their experiences with
witnesses under examination. One of
the parties told the following: He was
questioning a witness and said: "You
have lived in New York a number of
years. How long?" "Just twenty-five
years." "Where did you live before
that time?" asked the lawyer, hoping
to prove an Important point. "I didn't
live," replied the witness. "I was sin
gle!"

NATIONAL ELECTION DAY.
Why It's the Tuesday After the First
Monday In November.
Why should the law prescribe "the
Tuesday next after - the first Monday
in November" ; instead of saying "the
first Tuesday ?"j Like many other small
things this provision introduces an in
teresting picture of the past.
Although the constitution requires
the electors in all the states to meet
and choose a president , on the same
day, it was not until 1845 that a law
was passed by congress providing that
the electors should be chosen on . the
same day throughout the United
States. When William Henry Harrison
was the Whig candidate, in 1840, New
York began to vote on the first Monday
in November, and the polls were kept
open until Wednesday night Election
day in Massachusetts was the second
Monday, but before that day, in this
instance, enough states had voted to de
cide the contest The National Intelli
gencer of that year records that several
thousand aged and infirm Whigs in
Massachusetts did not bother to go to
the polls.
Delaware voted a day later ' than
Massachusetts. Illinois, Indiana and
Pennsylvania were among : the ■ early
voting states. Alabama was one of the
last. This diversity, corniced with
slow methods of transmitting news,
left • the election results in doubt for
many days.
' The system was not satisfactory., The
states that voted early had an undue
influence on the result. Especially was
this true as communication became
more rapid, and by 1840 an enthusiastic
editor told how the news from Pitts
burg had been brought to New York ln
thirty-five hours. "This," he added
significantly, "is a sign of the times."
Congress accordingly decided to es
tablish a uniform day. The original
bill named the first Tuesday ln No
vember, but it was found necessary to
harmonize this with the requirement
that not more than thirty days should
elapse before the 'meeting' of the elect
oral colleges ln the different states,
which had been, set for the first
Wednesday in December. When Tues
day is the first day of November, De
cember will have no Wednesday till
the seventh. The Interval is thirty
seven days. Under the law as it was
passed in 1845 not more than twenty
nine days can elapse between election
day "and the first Wednesday, in De
cember. Under the law of 1887 the
electors do not meet to give their votes
until the second Monday in January.—
