JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY. CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. JULY 24. 1903.
Just a Bit Misty.
There had been half a dozen stories
of thick fogs, but Captain Mansfield
had waited his turn with patience. It
came at last, and the other captains
turned their weather beaten faces to
ward him with an expression of cheer
ful credulity.
" 'Twas told me of a house setting
pretty nigh the shore along halfway
down the coast o' Maine," said Cap
tnin Mansfield. "I could show you the
house -if it came right It has a cu
rious lopsided portico on it, and one
flay I asked the man that lives there
why it happened to be built that queer
shape.
" 'Well,' says he, 'the talk is that the
man who lived here first had a cousin
that was an architect up Boston way,
and one time the feller was down here
in a terrible foggy spell, and he was
figuring out to his cousin how he could
build a little portico of such and such
dimensions, measuring out into the
fog with his rule, and bo on.
""Twas in the late afternoon; he
went off next day by train. The fog
still held, and along in the morning
the man that lived here happened to
notice that the marks of the rule out
into the fog were still plain, so as he
couldn't go a -fishing he took some lum
ber and built the foundations of this
portico. That queer jog that makes
it lopsided is where the wind bore in
on the fog, they say, and bent the
rule marks in.' "—Youth's Companion.
A Wedding: In Holland.
A Dutch wedding is a curious con
trast to an English one. In Holland
the wedding party enters the church
two and two, the procession being
headed by the bride and bridegroom.
Forms are arranged in a semicircle
round the pulpit and there the young
people with their friends and relatives
seat themselves. The ceremony con
sists of the reading of a' portion of
Scripture and a long admonition to the
bride and bridegroom, delivered extem
pore by the black gowned minister.
The prayers are sat through like the
rest of the service, for it is against
Calvinistlc custom to kneel to pray.
At tbe close of the service Bibles are
presented to the young couple and to
certain of their relatives. Then the
marriage is registered. This free dis
tribution of Bibles, which is made by
the state, accounts for the very small
sale there is for the Holy Scriptures
in Holland. . ■
Nuremberg.
Nuremberg, whose walls are report
ed to be showing signs of rapid decay,
was once almost the richest and most
famous town in Europe. The well
known saying of Pope Pius ll.— that
a Nuremberg citizen was better off
than a Scottish king— was justified by
the accounts that have been preserved
of the town and its burghers. In the
fifteenth century there came from
Nuremberg the first watches known as
"Nuremberg eggs;" the first cannon,
the first gun lock, the first wire draw
ing machine, the clarinet, certain de
scriptions of pottery and the art of
painting on glass. For 800 years its
now decaying walls defended the val
ley of the Pegnitz against all enemies.
Four hundred towers once topped the
walls, but only about a third of them
now remain.
The Millionaire Malady.
Men who have sacrificed health and
youth, scrimped their families and in
jured their digestion in the acquire
ment of a "pile" often think they are
public benefactors and that humanity
in general owes them a debt. of grati
tude for being so rich. In consequence
they resent as cruel injustice the fa
tigue, chagrin and newspaper notoriety
that money invariably brings in its
trail. It would be about as consistent
for a little boy who had gorged himself
on purloined apples to feel Injured
when an avenging stomach ache fol
lowed gluttony.— Eliot Gregory in Cen
tury.
Oar Eccentric Phrases.
Why do we always talk of putting on
a coat and vest? Who puts on a coat
before a vest? We also say putting on
shoes and stockings? Who puts on shoes
before the stockings? We also put up
signs telling people to wipe their feet
when we mean their boots or shoes.
And a father tells a boy he will warm
his Jacket when he means to warm his
pantaloons. We are a little eccentric
in our phrases at times.
The Quail In France.
In France the quail is called the bird
of prophecy, this from an idea that
the number of his calls foretells the
price of wheat. If he calls twice
without resting the farmer expects but
2 francs per bnshel for his grain; if
the bird calls four times he expects
to realize twice the price which two
calls insure.

LAURA KEENE'S DREAM.
A Vision In Slumber That Was Turn-
Ed Into a Reality.
Stuart Robson used to tell a strange
story ef Laura Keene, with whom he
played in the sixties in the last centu
ry. "The sight of .a bottle of, red ink
was enough to upset her for a week,"
he said. "On one occasion we were
playing a farce called 'The Lady and
the Devil.' An-> important scene of it
was when she was sitting at a table
preparatory to writing a letter. I, as
her servant stood at the back of a
chair. Take your right band off that
chair,' she whispered. The stage dia
logue proceeded. 'You are sure you
can find Don Rafael at his lodgings?'
'Yes, madam; his servant tells me his
wounds will confine him to his bed for
a week.' 'Is this the only paper that
we have? Where is the ink?' 'Here,
madam.' And I bent forward to place
the ink within her reach, when, in my
confusion at her reproof, the vessel
was upset and its contents trickled
on to the lap of her satin dress. The
Ink was blood red. I shall never for
get the ghastly look that overspread
her face, and I was so frightened that
I never knew how the scene ended. . "
"The next morning at rehearsal she
told me I was doomed to 111 luck for the
remainder of my days. She called trie
company together and gave them a de
tailed description of the 'awful scene'
the night before occasioned by the
young man who would never make an
actor. She told of a terrible dream she
had had in which some great person
had been foully murdered before her
eyes; how she had attempted rescue
■without avail; how he had fallen dead
at her feet, and how his blood slowly
oozed into her lap. It was two years
after this that Miss Keene was play
ing at Ford's theater, Washington, on
the occasion when Abraham Lincoln
was shot Miss Keene was the only
person who seemed to realize the sit
uation. She ran to the box, and in b
moment the head of the dying man
was in her lap, while the scene of her
dream was being pitifully enacted."-

THE TOO EARLY BIRD.
A Social Nuisance For Whom There
Is No Excuse.
The toe early birds are a sourco of
trouble ami inconvenience to the entire
neighborhood.
Invite the too early birds to a dinner,
and they arrive an hour before the
time.
Your last little touches have tq be
delegated to the first amiable soul who
appreciates the misery of entertaining
the too early birds. You had intended
to replace a vase of carnations with
one of roses or possibly you had at the
last moment intended to shift the plate
cards, having suddenly remembered
that Miss Jones had a quiet fancy for
Mr. Smith; that Mr. Smith recipro
cated. ' .
Mr. Smith will have to wonder, and
Miss Jones will have to summon up her
presence of mind and conceal her dis
appointment. The too early birds must
be greeted as though you were glad to
see them and appreciated their appar
ent impatience to have the fun begin.
You really would like to give your
hair another touch, but not so. Your
guests await you.
The too early birds haunt the railway
stations hours before the train leaves
and start off on the journey jaded and
out of sorts.
If the too early birds are ever amia
ble it is at such a "previous" hour that
the rest of mankind is elsewhere, and
the fact is not generally appreciated.
' If there Is one class of humanity
more exasperating than the too early
birds I have yet to meet them. The
man who is too late may entail incon
venience, but at least you have the sat
isfaction of noting his discomfiture at
missing the treat through his own act.
The too early birds are an infliction,
and they carry with them no compen
sating reflection whatever.— Plttsburg
Chronicle-Telegraph.
The Tools of the Egyptians.
The ancient Egyptians had tools for
stone working equal to anything in use
today. They used both solid and tubu
lar drills and straight and circular
saws. The drills were set with jewels,
probably corundum, and even latho
tools had such cutting edges. So re
markable was the quality of the tubu
lar drills, it is said, and the skill of
the workmen that the cutting marks
in the hard granite give no indication
of the wear of the tool, while n cut of
a tenth part of an inch was inside in
the hardest rock at each revolution,
and a hole through both the hardest
and softest material was bornl perfect
ly smooth and uniform throughout. Of
the material and method of making the
tools nothing Is known.
Bon Indians Hade Ma'plsSuJar.
Ever since the Indians in the section
of Vermont now known as Fletcher
discovered "honey" in the maple trees
that district has been known far and
wide as the heart of the Vermont sug
ar country. The way the red men ex
tracted the delicious compound was
somewhat slow as compared with the
present process. He used to cut a
slanting gash in the bark and insert
in the lower end a gauge shaped piece
of wood, from which the sap ran and
dropped into a poplar or bass wood
trough. At the end of the season
these troughs would be set up against
the trees and left until the following
season, by which time the troughs
would be thoroughly mildewed.
. This materially added to the flavor
of the aboriginal sugar, but can hardly
be said to have improved it The
evaporator of those times consisted of
an Iron kettle swung from a sapling
bent over a stump. By a slow and
tert»jj«s process the sap was first heat
ed and then boiled in this kettle, often
taking two or three days' boiling, be
fore it could be sugared off. This was
the way in which the redskins and the
early Vermbnters eked out a "sweet
nin" of their tea and johnnycake.
A Clever French Captive.
A person who was supposed to be the
French General Mouton, count de Lo
bau, was once captured by an English
vessel, but after a time the captain dis
covered that, his prisoner was the
Count de Montrond. "Why did you de
ceive me?" he demanded angrily of the
count. "I did not deceive you," replied
Montrond; "not at all. You thought I
was General Mouton. You told me so.
You have a fifty gun frigate. Was It
for me, who have only a pocket pistol,
to contradict you?" '
The captain did not forgive Montrond
and took every opportunity to treat
him rudely. One evening at dinner
some one proposed the health of tbe
French. As Montrond rose to acknowl
edge it the captain cried: "They are all
cowards! . I make no exceptions!"
When Montrond's turn came he gave
this sentiment: "The English— they are
all gentlemen, but I make exceptions."
Hotr Green Turtles Feed.
The green turtles of southern Flor
ida live in deep water and feed on sea
plants, mostly the kind called "turtle
grass," which they cut off near the
roots, eating the lower parts and leav
ing the tops floating so that it collects
in great fields and marks the spots
where the animals are to be hunted
for by the fishermen. After browsing
on such ocean pastures the green tur
tles go to the mouths of rivers for
baths of fresh water, which they seem
to need from time to time. The Flor
ida fishermen say the reptiles enter the
creeks and roll together masses of
grass, cementing them into balls with
clay. When the turn of the tide takes
the bulls out to sea they follow them.
The fishermen watch for such balls
floating down the creeks, and whan
ti*ey see them they stretch nets across
the mouths of the streams and always
catch the turtles.
How Pansanlns Died.
*Pausanius, the Greek general, died
by self administered poison. When
hotly pursued by those sent to appre
hend him on a charge of treason and
sacrilege he took refuge in the sanc
tuary of a temple/ Unable to remove
him by force and also unwilling to
violate the sanctuary, the officers
walled up the entrance and began to
unroof the building. When he could
be seen they noticed that he was chew
ing something which proved to be a
quill filled with poison. By the time
the work bad sufficiently advanced to
admit of their entrance he was in a
dying condition.
The Anger Fish.
The anger fish, half fish, half crab,
is the terror of all vessels but iron
clads that use the south seas. This
creature, which Is not bigger than an
almond, has a proboscis like an en
large gnat sting that can bore through
even sheet iron. Anger fish frequent
many of the lagoons of the coral
islands and burrow" holes for them
selves in the coral, but they have a
perverse habit of doing the same thing
to ships lying at anchor, and the dam
age generally shows Itself when next
the vessel is at sea in bad weather—
with disastrous results.
Molasses and Salt Poultice.
What is said to be an infallible
remedy for sprains and bruises attend
ed with painful inflammation is a poul
tice of hot molasses and salt. Stir the
molasses so stiff with salt that the
poultice can be held in place by a
muslin bandage and wrap the affected
parts well, so as to retain the heat as
long as possible. This Is good for
beasts as well as human beings. ,

Reasoning Power In Animal*.
Animal Intelligence, though not nec
essarily higher In degree when they are
acting as our servants and not for their
own ends, Is then very much more easi
ly approached and understood by us.
The "point" Is a curious example of
an action In which Instinct and reason
meet The stopping of the dog, howev
er It began, has by training and heredi
ty become instinctive. The dog, even
when quite a puppy, stops when It
HiipJls the game and remains almost
paralyzed, its impulse to rush In and
seize it being checked by a strong to
stlnct to stand still. Yet the dog, after
he had accompanied his master and
had game shot over him, Is quite
aware that he Is a half controlled "me
dium," and while still under the domi
nating "pointing" instinct will look
round imploringly to his master to urge
him to hurry up if the scent tells him
that the birds are moving. A bordei
line action of a different kind is the
squatting of young birds. is a per
fectly reasonable precaution. Keeping
still and lying low are not characteris
tics peculiar only to Br"er Rabbit, but
it is most remarkable to see the way
in which tiny peewits or little teal,
hardly bigger than a fluffy bee, lie
down, put their little chins flat on the
ground and remain motionless for min
utes to avoid being seen.
An Effective Telegram.
• When Senator Depew was president
of the New York Central Railroad com
pany he received a telegram which h€
preserved fox a number of years and
now and then showed to his friends,
says a reminiscent writer for the Wash
ington Star. This telegram reached
him one fine morning a short time be
fore Senator Platt was elected to the
United States senate for the second
time. It was sent from one of the sta
tions of the New York Central and
read:
Please stop the noon express here to
take on Mrs. PJatt and ' MB TOO.
It was a" very unusual thing for that
train to stop at that particular station,
but Mr. Depew at once gave an order
to have it done.
This telegram was referred to In the
presence of Senator Platt on one occa
sion.
"You see," said the senator, "I want
ed that train to stop without the least
question of doubt. I knew that the
way to reach Depew's heart was with
a joke, and so I sent that telegram."
A Persistent Office Seeker.
Governor Stanley of Kansas was
once so pestered by office seekers, re
lates the Saturday Evening Post, that
he found it necessary publicly to make
the statement that in view of the ex
ceedingly numerous applications for
office he had received through^ the
malls he should be unable to give any
attention to them, much less afford
any hope of success to the various ap
plicants.
In the course of a few days after
making the statement in question the
governor received the following note:
"My Dear Governor — I understand
that you have said that you were go
ing to take a week off to destroy the
pile of letters asking for jobs. If ev
erything else is gone, then, my dear
governor, I should like the job of tear
ing up the letters."
Gnnpotvder and Artillery.
There is abundant evidence that the
origin of gunpowder and artillery goes
far back in the dim ages of the past.
The Hindoo code, compiled long before
the Christian era, prohibited the mak
ing of war. with cannon and guns oi
any kind of firearms. Quintus Curtlus
Informs us that Alexander the . Grcal
met with fire weapons in Asia and
Phllostratus says that Alexander's con
quests were arrested by the use of gun
powder. It is also written that those
wise men who lived in the cities of the
Ganges "overthrew their enemies with
tempests and thunderbolts shot from
the walls."— Cassell's Magazine.
The Mexican Carrier.
The cargador, or carrier, of Mexico
is a- remarkable individual. Nothing
seems too bulky, nothing too heavy for
him to carry, and it is quite wonderful
how he manages not only to lift but
to balance his cumbersome load. It is
nothing for a man to carry a load
weighing 400 pounds, this being borne
either on the top of the head or on the
shoulders and kept in place by a flat
braid passing across the forehead.
Colonies of the World.
The colonies, so called, of the world
occupy two-fifths of the land surface of
the globe and contain one-third of the
world's population, or about 600,000,000
people. Of this colonial population of
600,000,000 only three small groups,
numbering less than 15,000,000 pop
ulation, or 3 per cent of the whole, are
composed in any considerable degree of
the people of the governing country or
their descendants.

A Lawyer's Apolosjry.
Some years ago there was an old
Judge on the bench in Berks county
whose decisions, In consequence of nu
merous reversals, did not always com
mand universal respect One day in
a case in which be was sitting one of
the lawyers lost patience at his inabil
ity to see things In a certain light and
In the hoat of the moment remarked
that the Intellect of the court was so
dark a flash of lightning could not pen
etrate it For ttite contempt the judge
showed a disposition to be very severe
with the offender, and it was only aft
er much persuasion by friends of the
latter that be yielded and decided to
accept a public apology. The following
day the lawyer, accordingly, appeared
before his honor and made amends by
saying:
"I regret very much that I said the
Intellect of the court was so dark light
ning conld not penetrate it I guess it
could. It is a very penetrating thing."
—Philadelphia Ledger.
The Limit.
Mr. Cribbs— Mrs. C, I have borne
with resignation— nay, even cheerful
ness—antique chairs that wabbled, an
tique clocks that were always thirteen
hours behind time, antique rags that
some prehistoric Turks wove, antique
china, antique bowls, pans and kettles.
All this I have smiled at, but when you
give me antique eggs for breakfast I
draw the line, madam— l draw the line.
Troubles and Jots.
The trouble with most of us is that
oar Joys seem to sink out of sight in
some inner quagmire, and onr pains
seem to take root on the thinnest soil
and flourish like the proverbial. green
bay tree. What is the matter with us
that a little irritation today can wipe
out in a moment all the recollection of
yesterday's glory?
Talclnar the Cake.
Concerning the expression "Take the
cake," the following from Bartlett and
Coyne's "Scenery and Antiquities of
Ireland," describing a dance In front
of a shebeen, 1b an Interesting Illustra
tion: "A churn dish stuck Into the
earth supported on Its flat end a cake,
which was to become the prize of the
best dancer. The contention was car
ried on for a long time with extraordi
nary spirit At length the competitors
yielded their claims to a young man,
the son of a rich farmer in the neigh
borhood, who, taking the cake, placed
it gallantly in the lap of a pretty girl
to whom he was about to be married."
The Vendetta.
The cross Is a threat of death, and
the Corsican who finds It drawn upon
his door knows that he must look for
no quarter. The vendetta neither
sleeps nor knows where it may stop.
It is not confined to two persons. The
quarrels of individuals are taken np by
whole families. Not even collateral
branches are exempt, and women must
take their chances with the men.

WONDERFUL UNANIMITY.
According to tbe reasoning of Judge
Rust there will be, if anything, a re
duction Of pay to the justices and con
stables of this county by his decision,
as there was an opportunity under tbe
' fee system to pile up costs indefinitely.
.The Dispatch hopes that the decision
will stand, and that the auditor will
accept tbe decision as final, and pay
the salary demands as they are pre
sented. — Amador Dispatch. .
' It is not yet determined whether tbe
auditor will appeal from the decision of
the judge, but it is to be hoped that he
will not, because the consensus of opin
ion is that the law is a just one; that it
gives a fair remuneration to a public
servant, and should be enforced when
and where the makers designed— Echo.
- Now that the superior court has held
that the salary should be paid, we
trust that the auditor and district attor
ney will not try to wear out the town
ship officers by appealing the case to
the supreme court We
hope that auditor Culbert and his
legal advisor can see their way clear to
give the township officers the well
earned small salaries. — Amador Record
I We publish the above as a psycho
logical curiosity. Men :. versed in
mental science say that no two minds
can think alike. Here we have all
our cotemporaries dropping into the
same groove of thought, adopting
substantially the same language, and
giving expression to their views at
practically the same time. Remark
able coincidence ! We often hear of
"two hearts that beat as one," but
the spectacle of three editors within
a radius of twelve milej directing
their "hopes" simultaneously in the
same channel is a fact not to be
gauged by the ordinary laws of men
tal science. However suggestive it
may be in itself, it is not for us to
inquire what hypnotic spell moved
them to travel the same mental path
way. The Ledger is not "in" on
this peculiar combine. We must re
mark, however, that this identity
of thought only extends to the hope
that the justice's salary suit will not
be appealed. When they start in to
give reasons for thus hoping, their
views become not only divergent
but actually conflicting. Thus, one
writer 6ays the law gives only a fair
remuneration to a public servant.
Another editor, who had the decision
in.extenso before him, says there
will be, if anything, a reduction of
pay of justices and constables under
the new law. Now, just fancy the
township officers, some of whom
were resigning and declining under
the'old law because it did not give
enough compensation, actually start
i'A nandamus proceedings in their
auxiety to collect under the new law
wliich effects a reduction in their
pay ? Was ever such a self-sacrific
ing spirit known before. In justice
to the logic of the decision itself,
we beg to state that the document
nowhere ventures the opinion that
the pay of the justice is likely to be
cut down by the salary scheme. It
does discuss how few cases it would
take under the fee system to make
more than the salary provided by the
act in controversy.. Into this do
main, however, it is inadvisable to
pursue the subject.
Our contemporaries seem to look
at the matter — like a lawyer arguing
a case— from a one-sided standpoint!
They talk of tbe hardship that will
be entailed upon the officials directly
concerned by^ appealing the case.
They do not stop to consider what
hardship may possibly result to in
nocent parties from a failure to ap
peal. Justices and constables are
under bonds. If they draw money
from the county treasury that they
are not legally entitled, to, they are
liable on their official bonds for the
amount thereof. Is it just and
right to throw upon these bondsmen
the ultimate responsibility of a fail
ure to take the case to the court of
last resort. Suppose the matter is
allowed to rest, so far as Amador is
concerned, in its present indecisive
shape, and that township officers
are permitted under the judgment
of the trial court to draw the salaries
provided for in the act. And sup
pose some other county appeals the
matter to the supreme court, and
that tribunal finally holds that the
constitution is a bar to the claim of
present incumbents for salary under
the act. Into what a delightful con
dition of confusion this would plunge
things? Who would be called upon
to refund the money so illegally paid
out? Would not the responsibility
attach all along the line— the treas
urer for paying the warrants, the
auditor for issuing the same, and
finally the justices and constables as
the beneficiaries of the illegal pay
ments. In this dilemma, the path
of safety for all concerned lies in set
tling the question as quickly as pos
ble -by an appeal to the supreme
court. If the matter calls for a set
tlement by the courts at all, it is in
cumbent to stop at no half-way meas
ures, but to settle it so that it will
stay settled.
Pope Leo XIII expired on the
afternoon of 21st instant, at the age
of 94 years. He died from the bur
den t»f years. For 25 years he filled
the honored position of head of the
Catholic church on earth, and filled
in with such a rare combination of
virtue, ability and grace as to com
mand the respect and esteem of the
civilized world. With the single ex
ception of bis immediate predecessor
Pius IX — who reigned 32 years —
his occupancy of . the papal chair for
25 years is without a parallel in his
tory. The conclave to elect his suc
cessor will convene August lßt.
SUICIDED IN OAKLAND.
D. D. Matron Takes Hia Life while Despon-
dent Over His Wife's Illness.
The Examiner of the 19th contains
the following relative to the sad end of
one of Jackson's oldest and most re
spected citizens: { ■■,
Unable to bear the prospect of a dis
solution of the marital ties which had
bound him for 64 years, threatened by
the serious illness of his wife, ; D. D.
Matson, 86 years of age, a pioneer and
well known resident of Jackson,' Ama
dor county, took his own life shortly
before 9 o'clock on the night ol July 18
by shooting himself in the right temple
with a revolver. I ,
As was his yearly custom, he had
come to Oakland to escape trio intense
heat of bis home, and he was visiting
his grandson, Frank Poulter, of San
Pablo avenue, between 43d and 45th
streets.
For some time his own health had
been gradually declining as the result
of chronic heart disease, and, added to
this trouble, bis wife was stricken with
pneumonia about four weeks ago As
tbe wife improved, however, the hus
band grew worse, until yesterday, when
in a fit of despondency, ho remarked to
his grandson: "Frank, it has come to
the point when I have to live standing
or not at all." Yet tbe old man ap
peared to be bearing up bravely, when
on his crutches he hobbled to the
bedside of his wife and j tried to soothe
and cheer her. %>. :
It was not ten minutes after he had
left the bedroom that Poulter heard a
shot at the front of the house, and,
rushing out, found his sranfather hud
dled in a puddle of blood on the porch
steps, with a bullet wound in his right
temple. He bad evidently propped
himself against the porch with his
crutches, and fired tbe revolver while
in that position.
The following note, in the handwrit
ing of tbe deceased, was found in his
pocket:
I want no inquest, as this U a volun
tary act to get out of misery. . I want
to be cremated. I thank you all. May
good health be yours. My condition is
such I must go. God bless them. I
can't stand this ordeal. This deed must
be done. God bless the dear friends/
Good-by. D. D. Matson.
Deceased came to California with his
wife over 50 years ago from Berkshire,"
Vt., and settled In Jackson, where he
pursued his trade of carpenter and
builder. He was an expert mechanic,
and under his direction the original
flumes of the Amador canal and other
large works were constructed. , Besides
a widow, he leaves two children—My
ron S Matron of Jackson, and Mrs.
E. Poulter of Oakland— as well as six
grandchildren and three great-grand
children.

Edgar Malone's 10 year old son, one of
tbe twins', was out in the woods herd
ing goats, and while in the act of jump
ing across a ditch, dragging a 22-rifle
after him, it exploded and the bullet
entered the fleshy part of the thigh
from the back. Dr. Tiffany was sent
for, but he could not locate the bullet,
it being night, when the examination
was made. Monday morning Mrs.
Malone took the boy to Plymouth to
try and have the lead extracted.
Ed. Mills fell and broke his hip in a
very critical place. He was leaving
their store room and turned to close
the door. His legs seemed to cruni plo

There is more catarrh in this section
of the country than all other diseases
put together, and until the last few
years was supposed to be incurable.
For a great many years doctors pro
nounCed it a local disease, and prescrib
ed local remedies, and by constantly
failing to cure with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable. Science has
proven catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti
tutional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
Cure, manufactured by F. J. Cheney
& Co., Toledo, Ohio, is the only consti
tutional cure on the market. It is taken
internally in doses from 10 drops to a
teaspoonful. It acts directly on the
blood and muscous surfaces of the sys
tem. They offer one hundred dollars
for any case it fails to cure. Send for

Amateur Baseball Game.
Last Sunday the people were treated
to lots of fun in witnessing a game of
baseball between two improvised nines
gathered from ihe business places of
Jackson, and dubbed the Hostlers and
the Biscuit Slingers. The novelty of
the contest combined with the genial
weather drew a large crowd to the
grounds, the grand stand being filled
with lady onlookers. The game was
not exciting on account of the rival
teams being evenly matched, as it was
evident early in the game that the
Hostlers were hustlers, and outclassed
their opponents. Still there was a
lively interest manifested in the play,
and both sides displayed a deftness in
handling the ball that commanded the
plaudits of the spectators. At the
close of the eighth innings the Biscuit
team concluded that the battle was a
hopeless one, and resigned, the score
standing 20 to 13 in favor of the Host
lers. Both sides were pretty well
fagged at the close, and were glad to
get back to town and partake of re
freshments liberally provided for vic
tor and vanquished alike.
During the game each player received
his portion of the joshing which was
constantly going on, and the umpire
did not fail to get bis share as well.
Taken as a whole the game was above
expectations, and the crowd was well
satisfied with the two hours' amuse
ment. A return game is expected one
week from next Sunday. The Biscuit
Slingers will have strengthened their
team by that date, and will go in to
win.
Amador Lumber for Australia.
The Amador Lumber Company has
contracted for 250,000 feet of sugar pine
lumber to be shipped to Australia. The
first instalment of this order was for
warded from lone last week, consisting
of 60,000 feet. Some of the finest sugar
pine to be found anywhere exists in the
forests of Amador county. This lum
ber commands a high price, both at
home and abroad. Notwithstanding
the high cost of transportation, owing
to distance from railroad and seaboard,
this kind of lumber is bound to come
into market sooner or later. There is
a great demand for building lumber in
Australia, there being a total absence
of soft woods in that country. In the
event of this initial shipment proving
satisfactory, it may lead to the opening
up of a large and profitable trade in
that class of lumber, The Amador
Lumber Company's sawmill is kept
running steadily, turning out lumber
in larger quantity than heretofore.
There has been no hitch in the output
so far, and the season promises to be
an unusually prosperous one. Teams
are hauling the product to the yard
on Sutter hill, to the lone depot, and
to the various mines of the mother
lode.

Anderson Leaves Globe Hotel.
E. Anderson, the genial proprietor
of the Globe hotel for the past five
years, left Jackson rather unceremo
niously this morning. Prom all ap
pearances, it looks as if he had no in
tention of returning, but rumor has it
that he went below regarding the sale
of the hotel business, which he has
been trying to dispose of for several
months. He is involved financially,
owing a number of business men, as
well. as being behind with his help.
Yesterday all the employes served no
tice on Anderson that they would re
fuse to work after last night unless the
money due them was paid. P. Dwyer,
owner of the hotel, made arrangements
that held them for the time being. The
personal property owned by Anderson
is mortgaged to three or four of the
principal creditors. Mr Dwyer is tem
porarily in charge awaiting develop
ments.

BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.
Only Two Applications for Reduction of Asess-
ment, and Both Denied.
The county fathers met as a board of
equalization on Monday, July 20; all
the members being present.
The minutes of the previous meeting
were read and approved.
A. Caminetti appeared in behalf of
the application of W. A. Nevills, for a
reduction of the assessment on the
Moore mine, near Jackson, from $35,000
to $20,000.
W. A. Nevills was sworn and exam
ined in Eupport of the application. He
said the property was in the same con
dition it was a year ago; no develop
ment work done, no improvements
made. It was held under an agricul
tural title, and therefore bad no extra
lateral rights. The improvements
made years ago were delapidated and
out of date; they wr>ro a s?essed at $5,000,
he would sell them for $1000.
Assessor Marchant stated that the
valuation this year was based on the
sale of the property last year, when it
was sold to Mr Nevills for $70,000; the
assessment was made at 50 per cent of
the value as determined by that sale.
Mr Nevills explained the reasons that
led him to bid up the property to those
figures; be had to bid it in to protect
his interests in other directions; he
and his partner owned four-sixths of
the mine; so that be had only to put
up two-sixths of the purchase price in
cash, representing the interest held by
the opposing bidders. The sale was in
no way a fair criterion of the value of
the property.
A. Caminetti addressed the board at
length in favor of the reduction asked.
He compared the assessment in this in
stance with the valuation placed upon
other mining property,' showing that
some fully equipped mines were assessed
for far less than the Moore property.
He was not blaming the assessor for
dealing leinently with these mines; he
believed it was the right course to pur
sue. But he did contend, in face of
all the facts, that the application for a
reduction in the case under considera
tion should be granted .
On motion of D. Burke the matter
was continued until half-past 1 o'clock.
The petition of John H. Springer,
asking for a reduction on the Wildman
Gold Mining Company from $85,000 to
$50,000 was then taken up. The petition
stated that the trust deed covering this
property, and which was assessed for
its face value of $85,000, was of the ac
tual value of $50,000, and the reduction
was asked under the rule that the se
curity should not be assessed at a valu
ation in excess of the property given as
stcurity.
By a unanimous vote of the board
the application was denied.
At adjournment was then taken until
1.30 p.m.
Upon reconvening M.Newman moved
that the petition of W. A. Nevills be
granted. The motion was not seconded.
M. Newman then moved that the
assessment be reduced to $25,000; sec
onded by L. Burke. Motion lost by the
following vote: Ayes— Newman, Burke.
Noes— Atnick, Grillo, Moore.
No further business appearing the
board adjourned sine die.
[The careful reader will not fail to
notice from the above report that no
official action has been taken on the
Nevills' petition; that petition was nei
ther granted nor rejected; it was never
put to a vote. It stands practically in
the same position that it did before the
board met; and the board has ad
journed sine die without disposing of
the business on hand. We do not pre
tend to know the legal effect of this
failure. Upon inquiry, we have been
informed that upon reassembling in the
afternoon the board held one of those
so-called "executive" sessions which
have become a feature of late. What
was done at this private meeting of a
public body we know not. Probably
in the mix-up between tho orthodox
and hetrodox method of doing business
the official disposition of the petition
was overlooked.
In Charge of the Doctors.
Miss Mary Bernecich is confined to
her bed from a serious attack of ner
vous prostration, brought on by over
study. She lives with her parents
near Murphys Ridge, and was studying
for the purpose of qualifying herself
for school-teaching. She was studying
under W. M. Fuller with the object of
appearing before the board of educa
tion at the next examination of appli
cants for teachers' certificates. Last
week she was compelled to desist from
her studies, on account of the preju
dicial effect upon her health. She has
been under the care of Dr Phillips for
the past week. Her condition is steadily
improving, and a complete recovery is
looked for.
Mrs Jas. Mushett was taken with a
severe spell of sickness while at Mokel
umne Hill last week, her husband being
employed at a mine in that neighbor
hood. She was brought to her home
in Jackson, and is fast recovering under
the care of Dr Phillips.
Judge Rust, who underwent a surgi
cal operation last week at tho hands of
Dr. Endicott, is rapidly recovering.
He will be able to resume his official
duties on the superior bench in a few
Peter Holtz of Murphy's ridgo had
to undergo a surgical operation last
Saturday. This is the third time he
has submitted to the doctor's knife

Dr. Endicott performed the operation,
and is sanguine that a radical cure will
be the result.

Ollie Boberson Instantly Killed.
A g!oom was cast over lone last
Monday evening when it had been
learned that Ollie Roberson, the fif
teen year old son of S. E. Roberson,
one of lone's esteemed citizens, had
boon accidentally shot and instantly
killed while out bunting.
Coroner Huberty went down the fol
lowing morning and held an inquest,
and from him we ascertained the par
ticulars of the unfortunate affair.
Ollie Roberson, Paul Winters and
Edward Waddell, boys about the same
age, were out shooting doves, and were
riding in a butcher cart. Ollie was
standing behind the seat, on which the
other two boys were seated, with a
gun between them, the barrel extend
ed upward. At about six o'clock
when about three miles below lone on
Sutter creek, Winters jumped out of
the cart to open a gate through which
they were to pass. The horse, pre
sumably frightened when Winters
jumped out, gave a sudden start, which
jerked the cart quite forcibly. In the
meantime Ollie had taken hold of the
gun with one hand to steady it when
Winters got out. When the cart was
jerked it threw the gun upward and
backward, the trigger caught on the
edge of the seat and discharged one
barrel, the full charge striking young
Robereou in the face and killing him
instantly. The other boys did not at
first realize what had happened, think
ing Ollie bad fired at a dove, he having
made no sound or utterance when shot.
As soon as the truth was learned the
unfortunate boy was conveyed by his
companions to the Roberson home
where the grief stricken parents were
told of the terrible death of their boy.
The coroner's jury brought in a ver
dict of accidental death.
Drowned at Bine Lakes.
Pietro Rovelli was drowned last Fri
day evening in Middle Blue Lake while
in bathing with several other men.
The men were enjoying a swim after
their day's work. Rovelli, who was a
poor swimmer, kept near the shore,
and without any warning he disappear
ed from sight, evidently taken with
cramps caused by the cold temperature
of the water. Immediate" search for
the body was commenced which was
not recovered until the next morning.
An Inquest was held by the coroner of
Alpine county, the verdict being acci
dental death. Undertaker Huberty
went up and brought the body down,
and arrived in Jackson ten o'clock
Sunday night. The deceased was a
native of Italy and about twenty-five
years of age. He had lived in Jackson
several years, was well known and had
a large circle of friends, but had no
relatives in this country. The funeral
took place Monday afternoon under
the auspices of Jackson Grove of
Druids and Jackson Miners Union, he
being a member of those organizations.
Jewel Bourbon vs. Mokelumne Hill.
The ball game at Mokelurane Hill
last Sunday between the Jewel Bour
bons of Jackson and the local nine was
rather one-sided, but was pronounced
a good game by the large crowd who
witnessed the exhibition. Both nines
had strengthened their line-up by put
ting in outsiders. The Jackson team,
however, was too heavy for their op
ribnents and carried off the laurels of
the day. Score being as follows: .

Catarrh of the Stomach.
When the stomach is overloaded;
when food is taken into it that fails to
digest, it decays and inflames the muc
ous membrane, exposing the nerves,
and causes the glands to secret mucin,
instead of the natural juices of diges
tion. This is called Catarrh of the
Stomach. For years 1 suffered with
Catarrh of the Stomach, caused by in
digestion. Doctors and medicines failed
to benefit me until I used Kodol Dys

Bough Rider In Disguise.
Ever since President Roosevelt's visit
to California, and more particularly
since bis exhibition of skilled horse
manship at the Presidio, every promi
nent politician in the State has been
constantly practicing the rough-rider
system, believing it necessary in poli
tics, and further believing that "Ted
dy's" heavy head of hair was the
result of this particular kind of recrea
tion. A' prominent attorney of Jack
son, who is successful In politics and
does not need to ride to gain political
favors, must have had some object in
view when he applied last week to
Kelly's stable for the "meanest bron
cho" in the barn. The animal was
forthcoming, and the attorney made
the trip to a nearby mine in speed
equal to the charge of "San Juan."
After earning a fat fee, the party of
the first part mounted the broncho.
It was only a moment ere the horse
was riderless. He know how to turn a
trick, and the rough-rider learned how
to turn somersaults. The horse came
to town without a rider, and he of the
"parting of the ways" came in on a
raaccaroni wagon, slightly disfigured
and minus a year's growth of hair, the
result of the brevity of the time of
flight. ' 3

Joseph Herschle vs lone Gold Mining
and Milling Company. — Suit to recover
$20,000 damages for injuries sustained
while |working in the Nugget quartz
mine. Complaint alleges that the de
fendant corporation employed a person
who was not an engineer to hoist and
lower the skip. . On Oct: 3, 1902, while
plaintiff was engaged in sinking opera
tions at the bottom of the shaft, the
skip, through the carelessness and
negligence of the one in charge, was
lowered upon him, striking him in
the back and left hip. He was thrown
down in such a manner that his right
knee came in contact with a rock, caus
ing a fracture of the patella, a lacera
tion of the membrane of the knee joint,
and other injuries. Plaintiff has since
been incapacitated from performing
any labor, either physical or mental,
and is now a helpless and permanent
cripple. His services are reasonably
worth (82.50 per month. He had to
guarantee $800 for nursing and medical
attendance. Judgment is asked for
$20,000. § John F. Davis and W. J. Mc-
Gee are attorneys for plaintiff.

Successful Entertainment.
A well filled bouse gave witness last
Friday evening te the entertainment
in Love's hall by Selfreno F.Dal Porto,
our local hypnotist. All present were
agreeably surprised in what they saw,
and were convinced beyond a doubt
that Dal Porto was master of the sit
uation and could handle his subjects in
a manner equal to those who have
spent years in the- business. This was
the initial exhibition of his skill in the
mysterious art, and his efforts were
encouraging to say the least, and as
practice makes perfect we expect our
friend soon to be among the foremost
in the profession.

A Pen Picture of Queen Anne.
Those outside of a palace may feel
Shakespeare's sentiment, "There's such
divinity doth hedge a king," but it is
hardly possible to those inside. One
of the Scotch commissioners to nego
tiate a union between Scotland and
England, Sir John Clerk, could not
have felt it during an official Interview
with Queen Anne, of whom he gives
fhis realistic picture:
"Her majesty was laboring under a
flt of the gout and in extream pain and
agony, and on this occasion everything
about her was much in the same dis
order as about the meanest of her
subjects. Her face, which was red
and spotted, was rendered something
frightful by her negligent dress, and
the foot affected was tied up with a
pultis and some nasty bandages.
"I was much affected at this sight,
and the more when she had occasion to
mention her people of Scotland, which
she did frequently to the duke. What
are you, poor, meanllke Mortal,
thought I, who talks in the style of a
Sovereign?
"Nature seems to be inverted when a
poor, infirm Woman becomes one of the
Rulers of the would, but as Tacitus ob
serves it is not the first time that Wom
en have governed in Britain, and in
deed' they have sometimes done this
to better purpose than the Men."
Six Follies of Science.
The six follies of science are: (1) The
squaring of the circle, (2) perpetual
motion, (3) the philosopher's stone, (4)
the elixir of life, (5) magic and (C) as
trology.
In all ages men of undoubted ability
have tolled early and late to unravel
the mysteries supposed to be connected
with these fascinating problems. It is
not always remembered that such in
tellectual giants as Bacon, Sir Robert
Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton sought
the philosopher's stone, which, strange
to say, receives some countenance
from the modern theory of allotropy.
In the study of astrology Lilly was for
a time even pensioned by parliament.
Most of these "follies" conferred in
direct benefits upon science, for in
seeking one thing their devotees dis
covered many another. The craze for
the secret, or unknown, has still its
hold upon men and is seen in palmistry
and kindred cults.— London Standard.
A Joke O'Rell Didn't Appreciate.
Max O'Rell was booked to lecture in
Hartman's hall in Grand Rapids a
number of years ago. Carroll Hart
man was having a serious time in in
ducing the people of the valley city to
see tbe merits of lecturers.
There was a big sale for the O'Rell
lecture and Hartman wandered over
to the Morton House. In the afternoon
to call on tbe French wit; also to pay
him his fee of $100. ■
"But I have not delivered the lecture
yet. Suppose I should die before to
night," said O'Rell, who could not un
derstand why a manager should pay
for something not yet delivered.
"Oh, that's all right I'd exhibit
your corpse," replied Hartman. The
witty Frenchman never recovered from
the shock of Hartman's remark. At
any rate, he refused to lecture In Grand
Rapids again.— Detroit Free Press.
Tbe Simple Coast Folk."
The Newfoundland coast folk are
"wreckers" as well as fishermen— not
wreckers in the criminal sense, but ex
pert workmen In stripping and unload
ing the hulls that are tossed up against
the" frowning cliffs. Every fisherman
can turn his hand to this labor, which
frequently pays better than his regular
vocation, and salvage schooners find
permanent employment there with div
ers and hoists, recovering from the
oozy depths the treasures of the sub
marine curiosity shop.
Tbe Newfoundlander of tbe southern
ebore counts on "a few wrecks" every
year to help him maintain his family .-

What* In a Name.
Canvasser— Are you single?
Man at the Door— Yes.
"Why, the folks next door told me
you were married."
"So I am."
"Yet you told me just now you were
"Yes; so I did."
"Well, what is the matter with you?"
"Nothing, sir. My name is Single,
and I'm married. Good day, sir."
The Value of Solitude.
Solitude, the safeguard of mediocrity,
is to genius the stern friend, the old,
•obscure shelter, where molt the wings
which will bear It farther than sun
and stars. He who would inspire and
lead his race must be defended from
traveling with the souls of other men,
from living, breathing, reading and
writing In the daily time worn yoke of.
their opinion.— Emerson.
Better Than Art.
"Yes," said DAuber, the artist, pat
ronizingly, "I'm selling my canvases
now at my own prices."
"You don't say?' replied Sharpley,
whoso works had not yet caught on.
"Yes, Indeed. I suppose you'd give
a good deal to be a great artist."
"No, indeed. I'd rather be you."-Ex
change.
Quite a Different Thing-.
Naggsby— Would you regard it as Im
modesty In a man to speak of his own
good looks?
Waggsby— Well, it depends. If it
were you I should call it plain lying.—
Exchange.
Painfully Matter of Fact.
"If a fairy should appear to you and
offer you three wishes," said tha Im
aginative young woman, "what would
you do?"
"I'd sign the pledge," answered the
matter of fact man.— Washington Star.

of friends, but he was in manner one
of the most fascinating and impressive
beings whom I ever met. I have
talked with Carlyle and Tennyson,
With Victor Hugo and Mazalnl, with
Raribaldl and Gambetta, with John
bright and Robert Browning, but no
one of these ever impressed me more
vividly with a sense of Intense person
ality, with the inexplicable light of
genius that seemed to well up spon
taneously from heart and brain. It
remains a psychological puzzle how
one who could write with passion and
scorn such as Carlyle and Byron never
reached, who in print was so often
Athenasius contra mundum, who
opened every written assertion with "I
know," was In private life one of the
gentlest, gayest, humblest of men.
Mow a Rat Stole Bulbs.
M. de Parvllle, a well known French
naturalist, told a remnrkable story
about a rat in the Journal dcs Debats.
A gardener planted one afternoon 250
tulip bulbs on a terrace, and npxt
morning he noticed that the ground
had been disturbed and that they had
all been taken away. He I was con
fident that rats had done the work,
and, taking a spade, he began to dig
in the hope of discovering their nest.
Soon he unearthed a large female rat,
which he killed, and after digging a
few more minutes he discovered an
underground chamber lined with hay
and leaves and connected by a corri
dor with two holes, which were evi
dently used as storehouses, for in them
he found the 250 tulip bulbs. This
was remarkable, but more remarkable
was the fact that they were neatly ar
ranged in two. rows and that not one
of them had been gnawed or other
wise Injured.
He Looked It.
A ridiculous but amusing story used
to be told of Charles Reade's dramati
zation of Tennyson's poem, "Dora."
We do not, however, vouch for the
truth of the anecdote. "Dora" was be
ing performed one night years ago,
and when Mary Morrison made her
exit to bring on her little Willie, aged
about four, she was shocked to. find a
lubberly boy of at least fourteen, and,
as he was the only Willie at hand, on
he had to go, though he was well nigh
as big as his mother. The Former Allen
of the play, being equal to the emer
gency, instead of inquiring, "How old
are you, my little man?" endeavored
to remedy the matter by saying, "How
old are you, my strapping boy?" But
it was a failure, for the boy, who was
Instructed to say from "four to five,"
-said it in such a hoarse, sepulchral
tone as to drive the good natured
grandfather to exclaim, "Forty-flvel
You look it, my boy; you look it"—

Cheerfulness is a duty one owes to
oneself as well as to one's neighbors,
for nothing so ' unfits one for the or
dinary duties of life or so quickly
brings on premature old age as a mo
rose temper, says the Brooklyn Eagle.
There are plenty of artificial aids to
cheerfulness within the reach of every
one who has real or Imaginary cause
for 111 humor or a congenital tendency
to surliness. When things don't go
right or your liver is guilty of neglect
of duty strive systematically to achieve
good humor by repeating over and
over the best funny stories or bits of
humorous poetry you know. If con
scientiously administered this prescrip
tion is an infallible remedy for the
most acute fit of blue devils. If yoa
doubt it just try the experiment.
Survival of a Custom.
On gateposts you will frequently find
a stone ball. Who would ever suppose
that the balls on the gateposts were
the heads of family enemies? It was
once the custom to stick your enemy's
gory head as a trophy on the gatepost.
On tho gates of towns were stuck the
heads of traitorous persons. In old
London, for instance, the bridge gate
and Tf raple Bar were always decorated
with ghastly relics of the kind, and the
memory of the custom survives on the
gateposts of modern suburban villas.
The Coat of Neglect.
"I need a vacation badly, but I can't
take it now," said Dr. Price-Price.
"Many of my patients are in such con
dition that I can't afford to leave them.
They need constant nursing."
"Ah, yes," replied the man who
knew. "I kucss there are certain pa
tients who, if you quit them, get well
the first thing you know."— Catholic

That Kfcd Never Occurred to Htm.
.When Lafayette visited' Loudoun
connty he was entertained with the
other eminent guests by President
Monroe at Oak Hill. Leesburg, too,
the historic town nine miles from Mon
roe's country seat, accorded him hon
ors on that occasion, and at a dinner
at that town John Qulncy Adams de
livered a famous toast to the surviving
patriots of tbe Revolution, who, he
said, were like the sibylline leaves—
the fewer they became the more pre
cious they were.
On the return to Oak Hill another of
Monroe's guests said to Mr. Adams:
"Excuse the impertinence, but would
you not tell me what Inspired the beau
tiful sentiment of your toast today?"
"Why," replied Mr. Adams, "it was
suggested this morning by the picture
of the sibyl that hangs in the hall of
the Oak Hill mansion."
"How strange," remarked the less
brilliant guest, "I have looked at that
picture many times during the past
years and that thought never occurred
to me."— Leslie's Monthly.
Chewing Dry Rice,
"A strange way of testing the inno :
cence of an accused person is employed
in India," said a Philadelphia mer
chant who lately returned from Mad
ras. "They haul the man up and give
him a mouthful of dry rice to chew. I
don't suppose you ever chewed dry
rice? Well, it is hard work. It takes a
deal of chewing to get it masticated
Into a glutinous mass like gum, and
that Is the condition that tbe accused is
required to get It Into within ten min
utes. If you are calm -and not afraid
you succeed, but if you are nervous and
scared you fail, for it seems that feai
has a strong effect upon the salivary
glands. It prevents them from secret
ing saliva. The mouth of a badly fright
ened person is always dry as a bone.
It requires a tremendous flow of saliva
to chew dry rice, and therefore the
scared prisoner inevitably fails in this
test It isn't of course a test employed
in the courts of the big towns. It be
longs to the Interior, less enlightened
villages." :i; -
Reptiles That 'Walk Erect.
Lizards jof several sorts can walk
and run easily on their hind legs. The
Australian water lizard, which is three
or four feet in length, keeps quite erect
when traversing long distances ■on
land. It is found In the neighborhood
of river banks, and passes much of its
time in shallow water. -
The frilled lizard of Queensland also
travels on Its hind legs on level ground,
keeping the frill folded when running.
When attacked it expands this fold of
skin, which stands out like a ruff at
right angles round the neck, giving it
a most formidable aspect, so that dogs
that attack and kill larger lizards will
often retreat before a frilled lizard at
bay.
There Is. also a tree lizard in Austra
lia that moves In a similar way. All
these species walk on all fours when
merely moving about or going short
distances. ,- :
Children Do Lie.
Do children lie? Yes; constantly,
persistently and universally, says the
Kindergarten Magazine. A child does
not tell the truth because he could not.
He does not know the truth, and his
approximation to tbe truth is very
much vaguer than ours. And there are
certain qualities of his mind which
make It Inevitable that he should per
vert the truth. In the first place, truth
la synonymous with knowledge. - He
does not know what truth is. In the
second place (and it is the same with
us), children gradually approximate
the truth. They have their ideas of
truth. In the third place, the child's
Imagination drives him often to tell
what is not true.
Brain Work and Hair.
Everything physical being equal, it
is established that the man who is en
gaged in professional work will grow
gray j sooner than will the man who
earns his bread by the literal sweat of
his brow. Thus by implication the man
who has more and harder brain work
than another— more worries, more
troubles, more difficult thoughts, less
vitality in proportion— this Is the indi
vidual and the profession that soonest
are marked by gray hairs.
Woman's Cruelty to 'Woman.
Another illustration of how mean a
woman can be was given' the other
night when a young lady was calling
on an elderly spinster who dresses and
acts with unbecoming youthfulness.
The spinster showed her visitor a beau
tiful handmade lace collar and said
proudly, "This Is over fifty years old."
•It is beautiful!" purred the girl.
"Md you make it, dear?"-New York

In Mediaeval Cities.
There can be no doubt that one ren
eon why cities did not grow so rapidly
la the seventeenth and eighteenth cen
turies as in tho nineteenth is the ex
cessively high death rate that pre
vailed during the earlier period. The
flood of immigration, mighty as it was,
did little more than make good the
places of those citizens who fell vic
tims to grievous sanitary conditions.
From the facts that can bo obtained
it seems to have been universally true
that almost up to the beginning of the
nineteenth century the death rate of
large cities exceeded the birth rate.
This was not because the birth rate
was abnormally low, but because the
death rate was abnormally high. In
the mediaeval city both birth rate and
death rate were far higher than at
present Infant mortality must have
-mounted to a grewsome height. The
uncleanliness and overcrowding of city
dwellers, now largely relegated to the
slums of our great cities, was the nor
mal state of nearly all classes of so
ciety In the London and Paris of Louis
and Elizabeth.— Professor Edwin O.
Jordan In Popular Science Monthly.
Consul Kins David.
This amusing anecdote of Lamartine
is related by the Baroness Bonde in
her volume of letters: Shortly after
the revolution of February be wrote
on the blank leaves of his pocketbook
the names of his protegees and sent
the list to be provided with places Im
mediately. Previously, however,! it
seems, he had scribbled "David" on
the page, and the head of the cabinet
appointed the said David consul at
Bremen; the postulant,- however, never
came forward, and, though the poet did
not like being disturbed, M. Hetzel
was obliged to ask who was the David
on his list . .
"He who danced before the ark,"
was the answer.
•"Oh, dear! I have gazetted him to
Bremen!"
"How very singular! I meant him
for a subject for meditation, not for
nomination. But you can cancel It"
The moniteur registered the change,
but few knew that the last consul ap
pointed to Bremen was King David! ;
Wonderful Sense of Smell In Dogs.
It has often been proved that dogs
are able to track their masters through
crowded streets, where :it would be
Impossible to attribute their accuracy
to anything except the sense of smell
alone. Mr. Romanes, the naturalist,
once made some Interesting experi
ments as to this wonderful power as
exhibited in his own dog. . In these tests
the naturalist found that his dumb
friend could easily follow In the tracks
of his master, though he was far out
of sight, and that, too, after no less
than eleven persons had followed, step
ping exactly in the tracks made by Mr.
Romance, It being the deliberate Inten
tion to confuse the senses of the poor
dog If possible. Further experiment
proved that the animal tracked j the
boots Instead of the man, for when Mr.
Romanes put on new footgear the dog
failed entirely.
Daigerott Symptoms.
The story is told of a Scotch preacher
who gave his people long, strong ser
mons and delivered them in a remark
ably deliberate manner. | One Sunday
he asked a friend who was visiting
him to occupy his pulpit In the morning.
"An' were you satisfied wi' my
preaching?" asked his friend as they
walked home from the kirk.
"Weel," said his host slowly, "it was
a fair dlscoorse, ■ Will'm; a fair dls
coorse, but it pained me at the last to
see the folk looking so fresh and wide
awake. I mistrust 'twasna sac long
nor sac sound as it should hae been."
European Tattooera.
Tattooing is not by any means con
fined to savagfe peoples. ' There are
races In Europe which make it a regu
lar practice, and men, women and chil
dren bear on their bodies ornamenta
tions that are as ornate and queer, al
though not as extensive, as are mark
ings on the bodies of the south sea
savages.
These European tattooers are among
the Albanians and Bosnians, who live
in the famous and notorious Balkan
peninsula. S?*v**?3

up at school tomorrow, which he did
not do today, he will receive several."

"I don't put much faith in proverbs,"

been that they wanted to borrow. Give
me the friends that are not in need." :
