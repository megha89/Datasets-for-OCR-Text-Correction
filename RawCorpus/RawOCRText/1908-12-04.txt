The Last Sad Rites to Judge Rust.
The body of Judge li. C. Kuat waa
conveyed, accompanied by a large
number of ptomlnent citizen of Amn

aignuted by tbe bar and the fraternal
organizations, to San Franoiaco on
Friday last. On the folloing day aer*
Tioea were conduoted at the residence
of Mia. Rust's slater, alter which
theremalns were taken to tbe Odd
Follows crematory, and there, alter
the bnet ceremouiea reduced to

crematory subject to the request of
the relatives. : •
There were nearly all of the old

to the universal respect and esteem
in which the dead jurist waa held by"
those who bad known him in life. - . •

impartially to all; to administer, the

Obituary Notice.
(Communicated. )
Died at his homo near Pine Grove,
on Saturday morning, November 21,
George Henry Kiuelmrt, \\
1 There are days in life which briug
to us such messages of suduess, we
would fail forget their passing, that
we might not carry with us the sense
of eadneas and lost companionship.
Much a day was certainly the one
bringing the message of George Kiue
hart's death, to bisfrteada and neigh
bors in this locality, where be had
lived co mauy yeara,— having coma
to Volcano when but two years of
age.
Here where .he grew from early
boyhood to the prime of manhood,
where he imbibed his first thoughts
and formed his character, he was
known but to be honored and re
spected. Though a man ,of positive
character, earnest convictions and
agresslve ideas, his impulses wore
generous and true and many, delighted
to call him friend. In their reliance
upon him, as such, they were not
disappoined— he was a friend that
was a friend indeed. . , ■
The best of his life and energy was
devoted to his home— that borne so
saddened but a few months ago by
the sudden death of Mrs. Rinehart.
The father's devotion to his
motherless boy was a beautiful one,
and the strongest heart, wuepa at the
thought of such soirow coming upon
one so young. The father and
mother are again united in the laud
where partings are unknowu and
sorrows do riot come; but tbeir child
weeps and he wonders why be should
thus be deprived of the bust life held
for bun. .May the friends of the
father and mother remember this or
phan boy, and by loving j' kindly
thoughts aud actions brighten his
young life, as they strengthen tbo
loving memory of bin dead.
It is hard to sco one given up for
ever when be has reached a noble
aud promising manhood, but it
would be an injustice to those dead to
complain of the edicts of the One
who bus thus called our frieud to a
higher, grauder life.
The funeral servioes were held at
the Pine Urove -M. J*i. church, and
were oouduoted by tiie liev. Wilsou
Morioy, assisted by the church choir.
At tne cemetery the Volcano oi'tlur 1.

with the impressive services of their
order.

MINING NOTES.
Mitchell -J. J. Cranmer was down
from Pine Grove this week and re
ports everything looking very bright
at this property. Operations have
been carried on upon tbe surface, re
suiting in tbe discovery, of a new ore
body heretofore unsuspected. Hock
taken from this ledge has been crush
ed, and yielded handsomely— some
reports saying it averaged about 830
per tou. It is tho opinion of those
who- aro best acquainted with the
mine, that with tbe judicious ex
penditure of a little capital it would
develop into a good paying mine.
Bunker Hill. — This mine continues
to move along prosperously. Reports
are current that an extra dividend
will be paid the stockholders this
month. The regular monthly divi
dend of three cents per share on tbe
15th is to be followed by another of
equal amount on tbe 20th, as a
Christmas greeting to the share
holders.
The California State Mining linreau,
under the direction ot state mineralo
gist Aubury nas just placed in the
hands of the state printer a compila
tion ot the output of eaob of the min
eralized counties in the state for the
period from 1900 to the end ot VMI.
which shows principally the gold,
copper and petroleum produced,
though in some instances structural
substances play a large part iv coun
ties having brick and pottery clay,
building materials and cement. This
compilation shows a total output tor
the eight years of 532:),1'28,C80.
Shasta county is given the leading
mineial output for the period in
dicated, with 8:iU,550,922 to her
credit, and other counties ranking in
the following order :Kern, 834,858,888;
Nevada, 920,329,940; Los Angeles,
819,582,387; Ualaveras, 818,10(3,070;

815,493,108; liutte 814,:i85,7C1 ; Fresno
813,085,217; Tuolumne 812,100,587;
Santa liar barn $10,143,883, and the
remaining counties from 8700,000
down, it is thought that the publi
cation of the actual mineral produc
tion of the oountiea will prove a good
advertisement for them aud tbeir
products.

CITY OFFICIAL PAPER.
FRIDAY DECEMBER 4, 1908
A DOUBTFUL CHARGE.
The Calaveras Prospect takes issue with the Ledger in its
position in regard to Haas, the wonld-be-slayer of Francis J.
Heney. Our cotemporary endeavors to make out that the
Ledger's article excused in some'degree the commission of
that crime. It was intended for . nothing of the kind. Its
purpose was to show that the methods in criminal procedure,
, as practiced in our courts, are*unfair, inhnman, and tend to
work up individuals who are subjected to the ordeal of bad
gering attorneys to the fighting point. Probably in no
other country in the civilized world would such wanton hu
miliation of witnesses be tolerated. And it ought not to be
tolerated here. The sooner reformation of such methods is
made the better for the dignity of the state and the protection
of society.
Furthermore, we take exception to the charge, started by
the papers in San Francisco and reiterated by our Calaveras
cotemporary, that Haas was hired to get on the Ruef jury
and promised $4000 to bring about a mistrial. It may be ail
true, but not a scintilla of proof has been produced to support
it. Indeed the circumstances go to show that this slander of the
dead has been trotted out to extenuate or justify the raking
up of Haas' prison record of twenty years ago. If the prose
cution knew of such dicker with Ruef or his agent, why did
they not raise the point in order to have him excused as a
juror. Surely it would have been a legal ground for excuse.
But no effort was made in this direction, which indicates that
no such knowledge was in the possession of the prosecuting
attorneys. It was simply an afterthought to bolster up the
brutal parade of. the one under examination in convict garb.
It is on a par with that other scandalous statement that Mrs.
Haas conveyed to her husband when in jail the pistol with
which he took his own life. As if the widow in her sable
robes had not enough of sorrow without this monstrous
charge being laid at her door. This was hurled at her in or
der that the negligent officials might be shielded from blame.
The Ledger has 110 sympathy with criminals or criminal
methods. But the spirit of our civilizaton is to give those who
have made a misstep an opportunity to redeem themselves.
After they have expiated their offense by suffering the penalty
imposed by the court that should be the end of the matter as
far as the state is concerned. To hound a man afterwards, as
was done in, the Haas case is persecution, and not pros
ecution. '
I The filling of the superior judgeship has already called
forth two almost diametrically opposite opinions from quasi
public bodies in Amador county. The conclusions reached —
or rather the conflict of opinions — must tend to perplex the
governor, who has the appointing power, in regard to this
very important matter. The republican committee has met,
and failed to recommend any aspirant from Amador county.
They know or at least have every reason to believe, that Gov
ernor Gillett will fill the vacancy from the ranks of his oonw n
party. His duty is to be true to the interests of the people,
and at the same time be true io his part)', That he will
fulfill all expectations on these scores is beyond question.
But the bar association of Amador connty, while distinctly
stating that several members of that small body are ap
plicants for the appointment, failed to recommend any in
• dividual for the honor, went so far as to favor the
appointment of a resident of this county, which in plain lan-
guage means the selection of one of their own number for
the position. That would be all very well, provided other
things were equal; that is if we have just asi capable
timber as the outside. Of the two positions, we believe that
of the republican committee is the sounder, and will be
more generally approved. The superior.judgeship is a state
office, aud we believe we but voice the overwhelming senti
ment of Amador citizens in hoping that the governor will
give us the best available man for judge regardless of the
locality from which he hails — and if from the outside, one
who will stay with us, and identify himself with the interests
of this county.

WHAT IS A DAY?
fou Probably Think It I* Twenty-four
Hours, but It Isn't.
Nine persons out of ten— yes. 090 out
of every I,ooo— lf nsked liow long It
takes tlio eartli to turn once on Its
axla would Buswor twenty-four hours,
and to the question. How ninny times
does It turn on Us axis In tin* COtifte
of the year? the answer would be
BGSU times. I?oth answer! nro wrong.
It requires but twenty-three hour.-t
nnd flfty-six minutes for the earth to
tnnke one complete turn, nnd it tnnkos
36014 turns during the year. The er
ror springs from a wrong Idea of whnt
Is meant by n day.
The dny Is not, as Is commonly sup
posed, the time required by the earth
to make one turn on Its nxls, but the
Interval between two successive pns
sngos of tho sun across the meridian—
that Is to say, the time which elapses
nfter the sun ls seen exnetly south In
Its diurnal course through the heavens
before it is again seen In that position.
Now, in consequence of tho earth's
revolution In Us orbit or path round
tho sun, the sun has the nppenratice
of moving very slowly In the heavens
In a direction from cast to west. At
noon, tomorrow tho sun will bo n Bhort
distance to tho east of the point In the
heavens nt which It Is seen ut noon
today, so that when the earth has
made- one complete turn It will still
have to turn four minutes longer be
fore the sun can again be seen exactly
south.
THE ANCIENT SPARTANS.
They Flogged Men. Who Grew Too Fat
For Military Service.
Among the anclqnt Spartans every
thing was cpnsidered secondary to mil
itary efficiency, nnd with a view to se
curing this the boys nnd men were by
law kept In a continual state of "train
ing." No deformed child was allowed
to live. Boys were taken from their
homes and "subjected^ to military regu
lations at the ago of seven. They were
compelled to wear the same single gar
ment winter and summer. At twenty
they Joined the ranks and from that
age till they reached sixty were re
quired to dine at the public tables,
where only a certain quantity was sup
plied for each man. The magistrates
interfered in absurdly small matters.
They regulated the degree of fatness to
which it was lawful for any citizen to
extend his body.
Those who dared to grow too fat or
too soft for military service and exer
cise were sometimes soundly flogged.
Aelian in his history relates that
Nauclis, son of Polytus, was brought
before the ephors (magistrates) and the
whole assembly of Sparta, and "his un
lawful fatness" was publicly exposed,
and he was threatened with perpetual
banishment if he did not bring his
body within the regular Spartan com
pass and give up the culpable mode
of living, which was declared to be
more worthy of an lonian than a
Spartan.
Clock and Watch Freaks.
"A watch isn't exactly dirty when ft
requires cleaning." says a watchmaker.
"It may need cleaning when it hasn't
even been worn.
"A common cause of this ls that the
oil In the works has dried up aud be
come sticky, causing the watch to go
slow or even to stop. In this case it
not only wants cleaning, but also the
addition of fresh oil.
"The best oil for this purpose ls ob
tained from the jawboue of a porpoise
or kindred fish. Many watchmakers
mix their own oil from various kinds.
"Clocks also stop for no apparent
reason. During a thunderstorm, for
Instance, a clock may stop, only resum
ing work when minutes, days or even
weeks have passed.
"Thunderstorms, again, have been re
sponsible for the restarting of old
clocks which have apparently retired
altogether from active service." — Lon
don Answers.
Brides and Wet Weather.
A Proton bride rather likes to have a
wet wedding. It is held to signify that
nil her tears are now shed and that
she will therefore have a happy mar
ried life. I know of no similar belief
In the British isles.
The Erza of Simbirsk callthe day
before the wedding the weeping day.
and the bride and her girl friends weep
ull they can. with tho idea. It would
seem, of getting the mourning of life
over so that only joy may remain.
The Badagas of the Nollgherries at
tain the same end by sousing the bride
with water. Some Greek tribes have
a similar belief in the virtue of a
drenching bringing good fortune.
The Omnipresent Rose.
Every contluent ou the globe, with
the exception of Australia, produces
wild roses. There can be little doubt
that the rose ls oue of tho oldest flow
ers in the world, perhaps grown from
the wind blown seeds In paradise. In
Egypt It is depicted ou numbers of
early bas-reliefs, dating from 3000 to
3500 U. C. Kosewater, or the essence of
roses, ls mentioned by Iloiuer In the
"Iliad." and tho flower Is spoken of in
the Proverbs of Solomon.
Truthful Cholly.

you. I have been engaged so many
times that my ex-fiancees . have per
fected an organization and adopted v

Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises fin area of
MH square miles. It lies on the- wes
tern slope of Sierra Novada mountains,
nnd emorapes within its territory all
tho diversity of valley, foothill, nnd
high mountainous lands.
Climate— The cllmato of tho popu
lous portions of tho county ii as genial
and healthful as can be found anywheres
In California. As cllmato is one of tho
most valuable assets of this favored
state In attracting 1 population, Amador
stands second to no county In this re
gard. It should, and no doubt will in
time, when Its climatic advantages are
more thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, become a health resort not
only for thoso In loss favored states,
but for tho residents of othor parts of
California. Tho tomperaturo alone tho
central portion rarely falls below 30
degrees abovo zero In winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees In the sum
mer. Snow soldom falls In the sottled
districts, and never remains on tho
p round for moro than a few hours. Of
course, In the high mountain roglons
of eastern Amador tho snowfall Is very
heavy— which is characteristic of tho
entire Sierra Nevada range. The sum
mer season Is alway accompanied with
cool nitrhts; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs aro. rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
Infrequent. .
Gold Mining.— The county, although
rich in other sources of wealth, com
paratively untouched, is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. Tho
deepest gold mines In America aro lo
cated here. The Kennedy mine is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
HOOO feet below the surface, with every
indication that tho pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since tho dis
covery of gold, tho county has contrib
uted fully $100,000000 to tho world's
supply of tho precious metal. The
mines are still -yielding at tho rate of
about- two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth i 3 produced by
eight or ten mines operating 1 on what
is called tho "mother lodo, " stretching
clear across the county in a north-east
erly direction a distance of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate between
400 and 500 stamps, and furnish em
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
industry is still In its infancy. Tho
unexplored territory, evon along tho
main gold -belt, ' s f al% ' a excess of tho
ground that has actually boen worked
or prospected. The county offers to
day one of tho most inviting fiolds to
be found anywhere in tho world for tho
investment of capital in tho fascinating
business of gold mining-, not alone along
the mother lode, but also in the almost
untouched mineralized country ol tho
east belt, some ten or twelve miles from
the main lode.
Besides gold, we have copper, de
posits of pottery, coal, imurbe, slate,
limestone, granite, and soapstono or
talc — all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities. — Tho agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce anything 1 that can be
grown in the most favored sections.
In tho foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetable are raised where irrigation
is practicable along the numerous water
courses. Further up In tho mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet, the
ooil 13 admirably adapted for apples
and potatoes. A ready market for
many times tho quantity now raised of
these commodities can bo found |iv the
various mining towns.
Grape culture and wlnemaking are
becoming Important Industries, both
the grapes and wine commanding a
better price than .the product of tho
lowland.
Land is cheap compared with othor
California lands. Improved farms may
be secured for one-fourth tho price
current in some places. 1 Unimproved
lands can bo had from So to $10 per
ucre. It does not require a fortune to
tiny a small ranch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agnculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts now dovoted to
cattle ranges might bo uiado tho homes
of hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Amador has a populasion of less than
12000. Three fourths of this Is concen
trated in a strip of three miles abovo
and below tho mineral belt.
Jackson, tho county seat, has about
12500 inhabitants, and Is an Incorporated
city ol the sixth class. Othor towns
are Sutter Crock, Amador City, Dry
town, l'lyraoutli, Volcano, lino Grove
and Olota. lone City is the metropolis
of the valley section, a thriviug town
of 1000 Inhabitants.
The community Is law-abiding. Edu
cational facilities are excellent. A
ischoolhouso Is within euay reach of
nearly every family. There Is ono high
bchool, located at lone.

THE CASE OF LEVI.
"Sometime? your city nierchnut
could rlo worse than go out in the
suburbs to llnd a perfect example of
the power of advertising," said tho
occasional story teller, who was one
ot a crowd of I'ittsburg buyers re
turning in a Pennsylvania elneper
from a Hying trip to Mew York.
"1 live out In the Riiburba of Ureat
er I'ittsburg, andjtbe other day when
I went la to urge my chief to spend
moro money in advertising a drive l
had planned in my department 1
found tho etory of Holomon Levi of
lilank linn helped a lot.
"Solomon Lovl Isn't his name, but
I'll givo his name to any of you who
want to uso him on tbe 'old mnn' for
an obieot lesson, Jjovl arrlvod at
Jiliink Kirn only a little over a year
ago. No; 1 don't live in that heaven
forsaken spot. My home is across the
bills, in Oakhin-Kt, but I'm only half
an hour away from lllauk Han by
trolley.
"Thai; little settlement is the last
place on earth where anybody would
expect to niako hiicochh v/ilh a dopart
mniit store. Uut ljevl made a success
of it simply through advertising.
There's only a dozen or two families
in tho sottloment, all with limited
buying enpooity. lievi went prospect
ing along tbe trolley line shortly utter
it opened and found a big vacant barn
in the piaoo that he could get tor n
sang. '.In took it because tbe (rout
was next to nothing and startod to do
a little inexpensive remodeling. Then
he let a patent medicino painter put
him up a flaring yellow sign across
the end of the building, 'Holomou
Levi'a Department titoro.' Evorybody
laughod— a department store in Uiank
Run I
"Ilut tboy didnt' know Levi. lie
laid in n modest stock. That was
the only thing about his establish
ment that was modest. He has since
boasted thut be had only SIOO capital
and precious little credit when be
started that wonderful general store.
The next week wo were all amazed to
see a double pngo ad right across the
iusido pages of our little weekly papor
down at Ouk hurst, telling people
whnt they could get ut Solomon
Liovi's for 1 sent, the things they
could buy for 5 cents, uud the things
for 10 cents. Tbero must have been a
huudred articles that ho advertised
for 1 cent— four clothespins, thirty
invisible ; hairpins— you know, tbe
tbing9 that women always are running
out of.
"Tbe merchants of my home town
had been taking the usual six inch
spaces to announce tbeir sales. Solo
mon J^ovi's new general store nt
lilank Kuu overshadowed them. Tbe
following week he was quoting prices
offered in ull the other stores in the
suburbs roundabout in paruliel
columns with his own aud ottering to
pay the trolley fare of every patron
who bought CO cents' worthjor over at
his store. Such catchlines as 'Why
not save 15 cents on a dollar's pur
chase and get a trolley ride tbrown
in?' seemed to catch the eye of the
frugal housewives in tbe working
men's homes along tbe trolley line.
Kvery wenk for lite mortal weeks be
kept that double page ad going in our
home paper— the biggest ad in the
paper. Kvery oue of those live ads
compared tbe prices at the stores in
the nearby suburbs with those at
Solomon Levi's emporium, lo'-'it bad
grown to be an emporium by this
time.
"Then he reduced the size of his
advertising in the ono paper and went
into every blooming country paper he
could Hud along tho trolley line, liy
this time swarms of women with
baskets were asking the conductors
on the cars to put them off at lilank
Hun. 'They laughed aud scoffed when
tboy first saw the barnlike structure
at the roadside, but they did tbeir
buying jiiac tbe same.
"Soon my wife's washerwomen was
nuking her why she didnt' buy her
washing snap at Solomon Levi's and
save '2 cents on every three oakes.
Tlui stock at ■ the 'ompoiium became
more ambitious, aud 1 do believe that
fn those duys tbe proprietor enumer
ated every blessed article he carried
in stock in his weekly uds. lie took
a shed alougsido the big bum as an
addition to the emporium and then
moved an old frame houso twenty
feet to make another addition. All
winter tho women Insisted ou brav
ing the weather each week to take
advautage of the bargains at lilunk
Ituu. Aud now Solomon Luvi owns
the whole settlement. Vim can see
his Boreumiug Digue a mile. At first
his family furnished all the uierkiug
force, but now he has a number of
'hired hands. ' And a few weeks ago
he announced that lie had 'arrived' as

NEEDS OF COUNTRY LIFE.
The Rovornmetit. which Is prying
Into nil soits tif propositions and
making all aoits of Investigations,
primarily for tho putpoße of deter
mining truths that shall bolp man
kind,has nmonn otber^thiußS appoint
ed a commission on country life.
This has resulted from the well
known movement of back to the soil,
mi effort of discerniug publicists to
restore tbe equilibrium that has boeti
serioußly deflected in recout yours by
cauees it is dow sought to discover.
This commission, by moans of him
dteds ol thousands of letteia written
farmots, touchers, ministers, UusinoHa
men and othoi'B, requesting thnir
categorical observations and opinions
on the conditions of country life,
sanitary, ooonumio, social nnd other
wise, is attempting to throw light on
the subject.
Here are some of the beads under
which this information is to be
gathered :
Are farms as good as they should
be?
Aro schools training boys satis
factorily for lifo on tho farm.V
Do farmers got reasonable returns
for their products? ' •
Do farmers get transportation facili
ties they should have?
Do fnrmers got the propor postal
service?
Are tho farmers organized to pro
mote buying nnd selling interests?
Are renters making v satisfactory
living?
la supply of farm labor satisfactory?
Are conditions satisfactory to hired
meu?
Are sanitary conditions ou farms
6utisfnctory? ,
. All concluding with tbo all-inclus
ive question which may bo theoreti
cally answered tbruuuh tue aggregate
wisdom of the hundred thousand:
"What in your judgment is the ruost
important single thing. to be done iqr
tbe general betterment of country
life?"
All this is not chimerical, but from
it much quod should result.
An Indiana farm baud has written
bis views to the president, and they
will be found to agree with tbe obser
vation of many:
"I have been a farmhand just lung
enough," says the president's corres
pondent, "to learn the cause ot so
many sons and daughters and well
meaning, reliable faimhands leaving
tbe beautiful hum and country and
going to tbo oity. A lack of order
and system on tbe farm, and too long
hours for a duv, is what is driving
the best minds from the farm to the
city and shop, What can we expect
of a hand or tbe farmer's wife and
her posterity in the way of intellectual
development when they get out ot
their bods at 3:150 in tbe morning and
work from that time until 8 or I) p.
in.? And no attention paid to tho
sanitary conditions of the home and
necessary conveniences on the farm
for doing tbe farm work with, the
least labor and time."
And much more In the same
practical tone.
lie might be asked to write in ad
vance tbo findings ot tho commission
after it has received tbe roplies from
its army of observers and theorists.
In the first plane, he would have
the farmer and tbe farmhand educated
men, not dull clods who know only
how to follow v plow and feed a pig.
The systematic farmer emancipates
himself fiom tho slavery that driven
so many young men to seek the less
certain but more alluring emoluments
of a city.
The bruin is really a more pro
ductive adjunct of the soil aud the
sunshine than musole, but too lew
appreciate that as a living, vital
truth.
Too often tbe farmer farms only as
his fatbur farmed, applying noither
demonstrated soience nor business
methods to his business, and In consc
quonoo there are few calliugs less
attractive or remunerative.
With the proper utilization of
nature's laws and business require
ments, the ' farm may be made tho
most attraotivo and the most remu
nerative of all callings.
The Himui agricultural Koloniou,
again drawing Jiis own conclusions,
gives as the reoipe for long lite aud
happiness ou the farm :
"Kegular hours for work, and re
gular hours for inoula, and regulur
hours for sleep nnd regular hours lor
rest aud recreation, with plenty of
standard papers and book*, and a full
faith In Cioil, uud good grub is want
cd."
If tho plan being pursued by the
government cau luing about this re
sult, mankind has been dove a good
turn.- Arkansas Democrat.

LIGHTHOUSE KEEPERS
Weird Vigils of tho Men In the
French Service.
TOIL THAT BREEDS MADNESS.
Tha Only Wbnclcr Is That Any of
These Lonely Workers Escape In
sanity — Pitiful Plight of ( tht Isolated
Keeper at Four en Finitterre.
A French writer, tolling of tho llfo
of tho lighthouse keepers along tho
const of Itritlnny, thinks it strange
thnt any of them escape Insanity.
The system of relief that prevails in
this country has no equivalent in the
French service, and, with short lnter
vnlw, months apart, a French light
house keeper may spend forty years of
his life tending the lamps in. ono sta
tion, wtth a Rlnglc companion, nnd that
station may bo on a rock out in tho
channel or the bay of Blscny, •which
boats can approach only in lino
weather.
As a matter of fact, the men often
do become insane or at least develop
monomania. Sometimes It takes the
form of hatred of each other.
In one case, at Terennec, one of two
men was found by a party who came
off from the shore In response to sig
nals lying dead in his bod with a loug
keen bladed knife through his heart.
Ills companion's story was that lie
had commlttcHl suicide after a long
period of melancholia. There was no
proof to the contrary, but after exam
ining tho wound the authorities doubt
ed the truth of tho story.
On another occasion, where father
nnd son tended an isolated beacon to
gether, tbe young man was seized with
nn attack of uouto mania. When tho
time came to light up bo planted him
self in front of the stairway to tho lan
tern and refused to allow his father to
ascend.
The old man attacked his son and,
finding he could subdue him in no
other way, so that the lights on which
bo many lives depended might be kin
dled, strangled him to death. The next
day lie signaled to tho shore for help
nnd gave himself up to the police, tell
ing what lie had done.
Sickness and death are no strangers
In the lighthouses. There is uinety
nine times out of a hundred no ckance
of medical a,id, and the well man pre
scribes from the medicine chest for
the sick ono as liest he can. He also
doe? double duty until his partner re
covers or relief comes.
There nre not infrequent cases when
the survivor has to sow up his dead
comrade in a hammock and launch Ills
weighted body from the rocks Into tho
Bea. Then come long nights of lonely
watching. •
In winter time the lamps must be
tended and the clockwork kept going
for fourteen to lifteen hours. The lan
tern is unheaied except for the glow
of tbe lamps up In its ceiling, and the
government allows the watcher jo
chair lest ho fall asleep.
It is no wonder that wsiitf fancies
come to the men. They hear' voices
calling from tho sea and see drowned,
men and ■women looking up at thera
from the breakers. One of their hor
rors is of the birds that beat against
the windows of tho lantern at night,
attracted by the glare.
Just as is the case with American light
houses, the feathered armies that mi
grate at night beat against the walls
and balconies of the beacons with their
wings and dash against the panes of
tho lantern, sometimes breaking tho
glass with their beaks. As their eyes
shine in the glare they seem to express
anger or bloodthirstiness to the men
within.
One of the most pitiful stories of
lighthouse life Is told of tho keeper at
Four en Fiuisterre, who kept all alone
a station on an isolated rock a couple
of mllos out from tho shore, but so
surf beaten that only once a month
or so was a boat sent out to it with
supplies.
Tbe cabin in which the keeper made
his home was on the shore opposite his
lighthouse, nnd tho recreation be most
enjoyed was watching it through his
telescope. lie could see the people go
in and out and the children playing in
front of it.
One day be saw something fluttering
from the door jamb, lie was puzzled.
Then it flashed ou him that it was
crape and that some ono had died in
tho house.
Was It his mother, ho wondered, or
his wife or one of bis brothers? He
counted tho children later in the duy,
and they were all right.
The wind blew, and the water raged.
No boat could come near him, and ho
watched tho crowd of sympathizing
friends come and go. Then ho saw the
funeral.
Ho recognized the cure at the head
of tho procession by his white surplice
and the ultar boys walking beside him.
Then eamo tho coffin, carried by six
men.
As tho mourners walked after it' ho
strained and strained his eyes trying
to identify each and thus determine
tho missing one. Hut In vain. All
walked with bowed head. The wom
en's faces were burled In their hand
kerchiefs; tho men held their bats be
fore theirs. He could iimko out noth
ing characteristic.
The men who eight days later risked
their lives to row out to him and break
the news of his wife's death found
him a physical and mental wreck from
sleepless iinxlety. I'ut he had kept the
Vigkt burning faithfully all tuo time.
Tbe French lighthouse keepers re
ceive from 700 to 050 franca a year—
9*lo to fICO. When they are wont
out they retire oo a pension of |6JM> a
month.— Cbk-iitfo Recorit-IUnM.

Communication
Editor Amador Ledger: —
There appeared in the Issue of the
Ledger k of /Nov. 27 a short article
credited to the "jNew York Frees, "
that ought not to :be allowed to pass
without notica.
The subject alluded to is one that
concerns all alike, regardless of race,
color, creed or what not. ■,
Just why a certain class of newspaper
men seem to delight themselves in
treating an event of such .solemnity
and awful reality as the day of judg
ment in such a. vein of flippancy and
levity is hard to account for.
Now we believe the Editor of the
Ledger is willing and able to make
repartion for bis oversight in letting
this piece get into his columns, and
the writer hopes he will allow neces
sairly brief statement of what consti
tutes the great day of judgement..
The day of judgment in its very
nature canuob be limited to a single
twenty four hour day.- This soon
becomes apparent when we begin to
study the matter. The term day, is
used in the sense or "this is a day, of
£reat discoveries" 'Washington's day'
and- .as the saying goes— "it may
not come in my day but it certainly
will in yours" said of most auy look
ed for event and meaning a certain
or rather uncertaiu length of. time.
If this is, correct it is possible that
we may know positively just when
the judging of the race began— that
we are now in that momentous and
thrilling period of earth's history is
susceptible of the plainest proof of
tne hply scriptures.
The prophet Daniel gives facts and
figures that are easily worked out and
understood; fixing the exact time
when the investigative judgment
should begin in the heavenly court
above.
We' are told each individual case
is called and acted upon separately.
That is, there is a record kept of all
cv.or li»')d uud these records are ex
aminea and passed upon. Rewards
and punishments will be given at
their proper time. In the meantime
the dead are quietly sleeping, good
and ovil awaiting the life giver's call
to arise and be rewarded according
as their works have been. J.'be eood
to everlasing life and all that makes
that life perfect and enjoyable, brief
ly a restoration of all that was for
feited by man in Eden.
Upon the other hand the incorrig
ibly evil receive a just recompense
for their wickedness by being blot
ted out of existence; tirejbeiug the
agency employedjfor this purpose.
That there is now or ever will be
such a plaoe as a burning everlast
ing place of torment is purely imag
inary. Its advocates like the Sad
duoees of old "know not the teaching
of the sanctuary service of the lie
brew host iv their wilderness wander
ings. The judgment day is beautiful
ly typified by the day of atouement
and confession of Sins by the entire
oongregatiou. This day ia still ob
served atuongii in a somewhat desul
tory manner by the Jews. The "Yon
Kippur" of [modern Jewry however,
seems to have degenerated into iuuttn
inglesa act of superstition, judging
from what one readß of the way it is
observed.
i'he great duy ot judgment will
not come upotT the world unan
nounced. If those to whom has beeu
entrusted the duty of unfolding the
truth due the people iv their proper
time fail to do so, Uod can aud will
set them aside aud iv thunder tones
make kuowu HU message. Even now
by tornadoes, euiThquaketi. tiro and
flood, accident by noa aud laad, He
[i speaking to a world paralyzed by
Iniquity aud culling its inhabitants
to lepuntuniHi.

We publish this article at the
urgeut request of the writer. We do
not as a rule open our columns to
the discussion of controversial sub
jects of n religious nature. The Meld
of religious uoliot ia limitless,
and to admit the expression from one
side would tend to invite discussion
from others of different faith. It is
merely because the writer seemed to
think that his belief was made the
subject of levity, all nnwittingly on
our part, that we publish the article.
The discussion must go no further.

5World's Biggest
Electric Plant
The Great Western Powor company
has sot Thursday, December lOh, for
opening day. Arrangements nre being
completed to turu a ilver Ithrough a
mountain and to let that tremendous
water power flood down upon the
generating machinery.
2, When the wheols revolve the dyna
mos will hum and the elnctrln thrill
will bo through ninny miles of thick
copper wire down to the bia now Co
well Cement works in Contra Costa
county, which will make their flret,
start wheu the Impulse comes unseen
through 150 miles of overborn! wire.
Already 8100,000,000 bns been ex
pended upon tho'ttlectric power plant
at Lns Plumaa, on the Feather river,
about twenty miles abovo Orovillo.
For a littio more l.hnu two years a
small army of men has been at work
up there in the slopes ot .the Sierrn,
and the outsido world has hardly
known it, or understood that Califor
nia wna quietly establishing another
world's rooord for bigger thiUßs.
When the power plant is completed
it will bo the largest electric geuerHt-
Ing ooncoru In tho whole world. Jt
will continuously produce 141,000
horsepoivor, tho energy that it would
take a vast herd of 114,000 horses to
exert. How much that means muy bo
interred from tbo fact that tho next
bicgest electric generating plant iv
the world is ut Xingarn Falls, where
there uro two plauts ot 00,000 horse
power oach. This one plaut is uoorly
throo times as big as Niagara's big
gest. It is so big that it could fur
nish all the electric power needed to
run the street curs, tho factories, the
elevators, and all the electric lights
within the city of San Frunc.isco. The
next biggest power plant in the whole
Wost is the Califoruin Gas aud Elec-
trie's station ut Electro, which is
capable of producing nearly yO,OOU
hoise power.

' iielow fifty foet the teaiperture
rises in the proportion of on

The Story of a Medicine.
Its name— "Golden Medical Discovery"
was suggestod by ono of its most import
ant and valuablo Ingredients — Golden
Seal root.
Nearly forty years ago, Dr. Pierce dl*>
covered that ho could, by tho use of pure,
triple-refined glycerine, aided by a cer
tain dogreo of constantly maintained
heat and with tho aid of apparatus and
appliances designed for that purpose, ex
tract from our most valuablo native me
dicinal roots their curative properties
much better than by tho use of alcohol,
so generally employed. So tho now world
famed "Golden Medical Discovery," for
the cure of weak stomach, Indigestion, or
dyspepsia, torpid liver, or biliousness and
kindred derangements was first made, as
it ever sinao has bVn, without a particle
of alcohol in Its maUc-up. «•>

WOMAN'S WIT UNCERTAIN.
As When This Wife Failed to Ap-
preciate Hubby's Pleasantry.
"Don't always rely upon tho ready
wit of a woman," said the man who
Is sometimes pleased to couslder him
self an oracle. "That ready wit busi
ness is sometimes prone to get way off.
"For example, my wife and children
had been staying In the country for
several weeks, and I was regular with
my letters, as every loving husband
should be. Finally on the day before
my wife was to start for home I con
cluded my , letter to her with these
words:
"'This will be the last letter I will
write to you for a long, long time.'
"When I got down to my office the
next morning I found a telegram from
my wife waiting for me. 'What on
earth do you mean?' read the. dispatch.
"Later a registered letter came from
her. She had blotted almost every lino
with tears. What It was all abont 1
could not Imagine.
"Then my telephone bell rang, and
when I answered I heard my wife's
voice speaking over the long distance
phone.
" 'Oh, John!" said she. 'Is that really
rbu? I thought you had committed
suicide!' "—Washington Post
Remedy Fop Choking.
"Raising the left arm as high as you
can will relieve choking much more
rapidly than tho act of thumping one's
back," said a physician, "and it Is
well that every one should know It,
for often a person gets choked while
eating where there Is no ono near to
thump him. Very frequently at meals
and when they are nt play children
get choked while eating, and the cus
tomary manner of relieving them is to
slap them sharply on the back. The
effect of this is to set the obstruction
free. The same thing can be brought
about by raising the left hand of the
child as high as possible, and the re
lief comes much more quickly. In
happenings of this kind there should
be no alarm, for if the child sees that
older persons or parents get excited
the effect is bad. The best thing is
to tell the child to raise its left arm.
and Immediately the difficulty passes
away."

"One day while In the net of taking
a drink In a saloon In Tombstone some
ono whispered in his ear that an ene
my was waiting Just outside with a
Winchester and swearing to kill him
the moment lie emerged from the bar
room. Putting down his untouched
liquor, Leslie walked to the door,
whipped out his revolver and sent a
bullet crashing into the brain of the
intending murderer, who never even
got his rifle presented. It was the
most quickly acted drama 1 ever saw.
As soon us lie watched his iniin fall
prone to the earth Leslie walked back
as cool as If It were the most trilling

Too Big Fop tho Booth.
Diners In n Broadway restaurant the
other night were amused when a
young lady wearing an enormous white
straw hat trimmed with flaring red
wings walked up to the telephone
booth in tho .corner and started to en
ter. She evidently had forgotten she
was wearing her "Merry Widow," for
she fetched up against the sides of the
door with a bang, her hat failing to
clear tho opening by a . good three
inches on either side. However, the
young lady was equal to the emergen
cy. She calmly grasped the brim of
her hat with both hands, tilted it to
one side and gilded through the door
like a sailboat going through a draw
bridge. Up to this time there had
been smiles and grins, but when the
young lady tried to draw the door to
and found that It would not shut at
all with her hat Inside the room broke
into a roar of laughter that shook up
even the most imperturbable waiter.—

Fought Under Six Flags.
A remarkable soldier has Just died
at Budapest in the person of General
Stephen Turr, one of the bravest revo
lutionary generals that ever lived. He
commenced his military career as a
lieutenant in the Austrian army. Then
he fought for the Hungarian revolu
tionary government, helped to quell a
German revolution nnd Joined Gari
baldi in his great struggle. On the
outbreak of the Crimean war he served
as a volunteer In Omar Pasha's army
against Russia and finally received a
commission in the British transport
service. It was while buying horses
for the British army at Budapest in
1555 that the general was seized by
the Austrians as a deserter and sen
tenced to death. But both the British
and French governments made such
emphatic protests against this sentence
that It was commuted to banishment.
Finally the old soldier settled down Iv
Paris.
Memphis on the Nile.
Memphis on the Nile, one of the
greatest capitals of the ancient world,
is buried beneath the ground which is
now tfnder cultivation by tho villagers
of Mitranineh, who will have to bo
transferred to other plots and compen
sated before the contemplated work of
excavation can proceed very far. It is
estimated that an expenditure of about
$15,000 annually for fifteen years will
bo required to excavato the temple
cites. apart from tho city. Tho un
earthing of Memphis, which contained
the finest school of Egyptian art. will
be by far tho greatest archaelogical
work of recent times and must result
in a vast addition to tho world's knowl-.
edgo of ancient Egyptian history and
civilization. The work will soon be
begun by Professor I'etrle, head of the
British School of Archaeology in

A Lazy Boy's Invention.
Tho long handled shovel has made
over $300,000 for its luventor, nnd the
inventor was a lazy, shiftless boy ot
seventeen named Iteuben Davis, whosb
father lived in Vermont at the time.
He set Reuben to digging dirt and
loading It on a wagon, and the short
hundled shovel made tlia boy's back
acho. Ono afternoon when his father
was awiiy lie took out the short handle
and substituted a loug one and found
tho work much easier.
When tho father returned homo Ren
ben got a thrashing, but after the old
man hud used tho iboTfll himself he

It patented. They ore now manufac

SEA BATHING.
The Effects of Salt Air and Water on
tin Humait Docly.
There Id R renion why parents h.tvo
In nil times nnd In nil Qf£C9 endcavoroil
to Kive tholr children the ljpnclLt of sea
nlr nnd sen bathing. An Italian physi
cian. Oct'OSfl, tolls nbout It:
It. h ngi'ced, ho Fnyn, that nil living
organlgma began iiioir first cslatsace hi
salt water nnd that an a result Iho hu

living being pnr.spßsoa vlthln his bojy,
In the ccllulnr Btagc, all those BtfQngO
niiirino organisms which wo study £<>
curiously in museums, And, seeing,
says Oerosa, that the n mount of sea
Wilier contained In every body Is equal
to one-third of that body's weight, it Is
clour that In tho Inflnltcslinally rudl-
DK.'iiliii-y form all known marine life,
must be present In the blood. The re
fiult Is; that when we bathe In the sea
or breathe the sea air we replace the
amount of essential salt which Is con
fitnntly decreasing In the system and,
nil unconsciously to ourselves, weak
ening It, Salt water, says Gerosa, Is
really tho main principle of life, since
It Is tho first condition of existence
Which the living organisms knew. It
is therefore always good for the body.
Whether It bo enjoyed at tho seaside or
brought lv bottles from tho sea. In
particular Is It very valuable In the
case of weakling children, nnd there is
no bodily stimulant so invigorating to
tho very young as sea water.
THE VOODOO IN HAITI.
Human Sacrifices to tho Gcd cf the
Serpent.
There Is ample proof that human be
ings have been offered ns sacrifices tc
the god of the serpent In Haiti. A
French archbishop of tho Island de
scribes a visit made by ono of the
priests to a voodoo assembly. The
man had disguised himself as a negro,
and he was thus able to mingle unde
tected with the crowd In tho obscurity
outside the sacred circle. After the
■white cock and white goat had been
slain and offered up and their blood
had been sprinkled on the company a
burly young negro came forward and
prostrated, himself before the priestess.
Then, still kneeling, he made hla
prayer:
"O maman, I have a favor to ask of
thee."
"What Is It. my son?" said the
negress encouragingly.
"Wilt thou Hot give us, to complete
the sacrifice, the goat without horns V"
The priestess gave a sign of assent
The crowd roundabout separated, aud
there was revealed a child sitting with
its feet bound. The French priest
rushed away in search of assistance In
preventing the unholy rite, but the
authorities on whom he called were
strangely slothful. When finally, on
tho day following, they arrived at the
place of assembly, they found the
grewsome remains of a sacrifice and a
feast, among them tho boiled skull of
the child.— Marvin Dana in Metropoli
tan Magazine.

train on an elevated railroad platform
and looking down a street to where a
hundred men and boys had gathered
around two wagons that bud come to

wagons, just standing tnere. gawping.
apparently with nothing el?e to do
and not In a bit of a hurry, but let any
one of those men come up tho stairs
to this platform when there is a train
coming in and he'd rush and hurry and
tear himself apart to catch that train
and get glum If he missed it. though
he knew very well that thoro'd be an

LOCAL EDITORIAL COLUMN
The drowning of Chief of police W. J. Biggy in the hay of
San Francisco on Tuesday last, adds another sad chapter to
the political fueds which have disgraced thf history of S»n
Francisco. It is a debateahle question whether Biggy l°st his'
life by accident, or sncidc. The circumstances surrounding
the matter point strongly to sucide. He was being hounded
by a clique on account of his management of the Haas matter,
and charges were pending against him. It is believed that
the strain was too much tor him to bear, And he resorted to
suicide as the outlet. It is not claimed that there was any-,
thing of a disgraceful character attaching to his conduct of
the office. He simply fell under the band of the dictatorial
clique, and they clamored for his removal. Of course he
showed weakness in taking the suicide route, He should
have faced the music like a man. But some men are so con
stituted that death is prefferred to even an investigation that
would give pain to friends, and this seems to have been the
make-up of Biggy. He was without question a conscientious
officer, and one of the best heads of the police department that
San Francisco has had for many years. He fell a victim to
the attacts of venomous newspapers.
The declination of the republican county central committee
to indorse any applicant of the judgeship is explainable and
the theory that there were possible canidates on the outside,
known to Governor Gillett, but unknown to the committee,
who by experience and loug practice in the legal profession,
might be better qualified for the office, than applicants within
the limits of Amdaor County. It must not be taken as a re
flection upon the legal profession here, but only indicates a
desire to get the best qualified man available for that high
and responsible office. This spirit is commendable, and is
not open to objection from any source. Shonld, however, the
contest for this position be narrowed down to applicants who
are well-known to the people of Amador Count}' by former or
present residents and of whose fitness for the place the people
here are probably better able to judge than those on the out
side, then it ought to be in order to cast aside all reserve, and
indorse the one who is considered best qualified. It is re
ported that the governor would make the appointment within
the next few clays. This would convey the idea that the va
cancy would be filledfrom the applications on file, all of whom
are well known. In such event, the republicans should lose
no time in getting their views and wishes before the governor,
who may be depended upon to meet the desires of the major
ity of the republican votes.
Clean Food
It Is a good deal more important that
food shall not carry the germs of dis
ease than that It shall be chemically
pure. Table salt, for example, may
contain some soda salts other than the
chloride and still be perfectly health
ful. Corn bread is less healthful when
made from pure cornmeal than when it
has some admixture of wheat flour.
But food that is not clean may be
more dangerous than any adulterated
food product sold today, provided the
adulterated article carries no disease
germs. — Boston Advertiser.
Sympathy

you sit down on these beautiful little
birds?"

The Word "Ogre."
Old fashioned etymologists used to
say that the word "ogre" commemorat
ed the sufferings of Europe during the
ninth and tenth centuries at the hands
of the ravaging "Olgours," or Huns.
This derivation, however. Is now aban
doned. "Ogre," which reached the
French language by way of Italian and
Spanish, Is really Orcus, the Latin hell,
afterward the god of the underworld.
In Romanesque folklore this god be
came a shaggy, black, man devouring
monster, with a particular taste for
lost babes In the wood.
A Gift to an Explorer
"Peary." said a geographer of CM
cago, "never stiirtod on one of bis
exploring expeditions without receiv
ing hy mail and express all sorts of
packages from cranks — cowhide under
wear, tea tablets, medicated boots and
whnt not.
"I'eary j»ee told uie that (leorgi-
Ade, a few dhys before the start of his
last trip, wired him to expect an im
portant package by express.
'"The package came. It was labeled:
" 'To be opened at the farthest point
north.
"Penry opened It at ouee. however
It was a small keg Inscribed:
" •Axle Brew for tiu> pole.' "
It Quiets
the Cough
This is one reason why Ayer's
Cherry Pectoral is so valua-
ble in consumption. It stops
the wear and tear of useless
coughing. But it does more
— it controls the inflammation,
quiets the fever, soothes, heals.

could only point out to you the difference between (he

grace of the lit and quality, and in self satisfaction too,
you would order from mo at once. I have the finest
