Laid to His Rest
The grim reaper stopped at the

street, on Monday night, and robbed
little dark eyed Victor of his Santa
Claus. The little fellow, who has
just past his third year, appeared to
realize that something unusual had
happened in their koine, and traces
of sadness were distinctly visible on
his countenance.
The father for the past several
years years has been employed at
the Argonaut mine, and up until
about two weeks ago, when he was
taken ill, was working - for that
company. He leaves besides his child,
a wite to mourn his loss. Death
was due to an attack of pneumonia.
The funeral of the deceased was

FELL DOWN
MINE SHAFT
Miner Escapes Horrible
Death by Landing On V
a Platform
Misfortune has for some • reason,
hovered about the South Eurkea mine
for the past two months in which
time no less than four miners met
untimely and horrible deaths, and
numerous serious accidents occurred.
The latest accident occurred on
Tuesday morning last, about 9
o'clock, when Yule Marich, a native
of Austria, plunged j down the shaft
of that mine. The unfortunate miner
was twenty-four years of age and
extremely well liked by his fellow
workers because of his genial and
affable nature. He had but recently
quit the Kennedy mine, where his
brother is at present employed, and
obtained work at the South Eureka.
While in Jackson he boarded at the
Milovich boarding house on Broadway.
.To this place word was immediately
telephoned after the accident occurred;
in hopes of being able to get into
immediate communication with the
victim's brother, whose name is Eliii
Marich Elia, was on .the day shift!
and "was 7 employed in' a~ lower. \e\A
in the Kennedy mine, but as soon ''as
word of the accident was given him he
immediately went over to Sutter Creek
as he was requested to do.
Several other native countrymen
hastened to the scene of the accident
from Jackson.
The victim of the accident was
working inthe shaft,- replacing tim
bers, when he suddenly slipped and
disappeared down the shaft. He fell
about 120 feet onto a platform used by
a gang of men who were engaged at
the same work on the level below. The
miner apparently slid- down over the
sills on his back and right side, as that
portion of his body is badly cut and
bruised. The right arm is also broken,
but no other injuries are reported.
Dr. Goodman, who is ; attending the
patient says that he does not think
there are any serious internal injuries,
as were at first reported to exist, and
that his patient will have a speedy re
covery.
When Marich was brought to the sur
face, he recognized his friends who
had gathered about him, and told
them he was dying. Dr. Goodman,
after dressing a ■ few of the most
serious lacerations, sounded the patient
for internal injuries and then assured
him that he would pull through finally,
if no unforeseen complications arose.

SAMPO MURDER
TRIAL FINISHED
Jury Renders Verdict of
Second Degree
Murder
On Friday last George Callandra
testified that he saw the three men in
a struggle in the street' opposite his
residence, and went out to them. De
fendant and Conti were attacking Pis
toni. Defendant struck deceased with
the rock after he got to them. D.
Burdisso was also another eye-witness
of the affray. Hesaw defendant strike
deceased with the rock, and took the
rock from him, and dropped it in the
.roadway. He then accompanied Pis
tonti to his room at Cavallero's and
put him to bed. He did not think at
the time that he was so badly hurt.
Drs. Endicott and Griffin, conducted
the autopsy on the body of deceased
the day after the affair, testified that
all the vital organs were in a healthy
condition, except the brain. A frac
ture of the skull was found back of
the right ear; the scalp was cut, and
on the inside of the skull opposite the
fracture found a large blood clot, al
most as large as a baseball; the injury
was inflicted by some blunt instrument
and could have been inflicted by the
rock produced. Death was caused by
cerebral hemorrhage from a ruptured
bloodvessel caused by the blow that
fractured the skull. The injury would
have resulted fatally even though pro
fessional aid had been called promptly.
Dan Bona, deputy constable, said
that he arrested defendant at his
home in Amador City on the 20th of
November, at six o'clock in the morn
ing. Said to him, "Jack, you fellows
had a fight out in the road." and he
replied, "I think we did." Saw de
fendant and his brother and Conti out
side Cavallero's on the , 19th between
11 and 12 o'leock; they did not say
they were looking for^him,.. to* have
those in the house arrested; Pistoni
was not with them : saw him after
wards in bed, and Burdesso and J.
Zarzotti were in the room, apparently
attending to him.
This closed the case for the prosecu
tion.
Ernest Spagnoli, in his opening
statement said they expected to
prov© an alibi, that the defendant
was at some other place at the time
the crime is said to have heen com
mitted. If they should not be able to
establish this to the complete satis
faction of the jury, he. hoped they
would consider it, and give it such
weight as to raise a reasonale doubt in
their minds, and give the defendant
the benefit of the doubt by a verdict of
acquittal.
Louie and Turn Ferrari were called.
They were present in the Cavallero
house at the time the trouble started'
and played an Italian game calle mora
witn ringers preceding the trouble.
George Sampo, brother of defend
ant, and also under arrest, was next
called. He claimed that he was in the
house all the time the alleged homicide
is said have taken place, and that de
fendant and Conti were there also, but
admitted on cross-examination that
defendant and Conti went out about
fifteen minutes before ten and re
mained out for about twenty minutes.
His account of the starting of the
trouble was that Eva Cavallero had
promised to dance next with him ; that
when he saw her dancing with Pistoni
when as he claimed it was his turn, he
asked her how that was. Pistoni said,
"What is the use of dancing with you,
you can't dance." This riled up Sam
po, and a general scrimmage ensued.
He said he was in the house of
Cavallero from the time the dancing
commenced until he went out with de
fendant to see for the constable, ex
cept the time the crowd were fighting
in the back yard ; that he was not on
the road between Cavallero's and
Gazzero's saloon until he started to
look. for George Sampo to go home;
that they went home by way of New
Chicago.
Mrs Sampo, wife of defendant, was
examined, and stated that she was
present when her husband was ar
rested. No conversation occurred be
tween the two at the time. Her hus
band came home on the night of the
19th about twelve or half past.
Stefari Conti, the co-defendant, tes
tified that he came to the county in
September last., from Oakland, and
had been in tho country two years.
Had worked in cement at the Bunker
Hill mill.
(jUcomo Sampo, the defendant, was
the last witness for defense, and gave

Coffman Discharged
On Habeas Corpus
The habeas corpus cases of J. M.
Coffman was argued by Judge A. L.
Frick for the petitioner on Tuesday.
Coffman was charged with assault,
with a deadly weapon upon M

tended by the prosecution that he
was involved criminally in the De
lucchi-Lopez fight, which resulted last
week in the conviction of Delucchi
for assault with a deadly weapon.
Coffman is proprietor of the hotel at
which Delucchi was boarding.and when
Delucchi was beaten up by Lopez, and
went into the hotel, Coffman handed
him the pistoJ to defend himself
against further attack. Judge Frick
cited over twenty supreme court
authorities to support the petition for
discharge on the ground of illegal im
prisonment. The people . cited no
authorities. On Thursday the court
ordered the prisoner discharged. We

COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL SITUATION.
The controversy over the location of the county high school
ought to be settled by compromise. To press the issue to &
vote between Sutter Creek and Jackson would be a disastrous
move, as whichever way the electors might decide, the result
would be two high schools — one in Jackson and the other in
Sutter Creek. This would be .deplorable, not only because
of the feeling that would be created between the two towns
primarily concerned, but also for the reason that it would en
tail a much heavier tax upon all property holders in the
county outside of the present lone union high school district.
That those living at a distance from either town should be
subjected to an increased tax on account of a contention be
tween two towns for the honor of securing the county high
school location, is the most deplorable feature of the whole
business. If there is any way to avoid this by mutual con
cession, it seems to us that. that is the proper path to pursue,
It must be patent to any impartial mind that a county high
if school within the town limits of Sutter Creek would be of no
benefit to Jackson. The four miles between the two towns
would be just as much an obstacle as the fourteen miles to
; the high school at lone now is. On the other hand a school
in Jackson would not relieve the situation for Sutter Creek
and other towns to the north. To insist upon either of these
sites is not wise. Better have one well-appointed couuty
high school, by concessions from both sides, than have two
poorly maintained schools as the outcome of jealous rivalry
between the two towns.
\ Why not compromise by agreeing to locate the school at
or near Martell. This involves a half-way concession by
each side. But it obviates the expense of a special election,
and also insures one good school . instead of two poor ones.
It will commend itself to the taxpayers as the economical
course, involving the lesser burden, and that is the most
-potent consideration with many. It is not in order for either
side to be stiff-necked on this proposition. The get-together
spirit is the one thing needful just now, and will be welcomed
as the proper solution of the problem, no matter—which side
takes the initiative with the olive branch.
The midway location will stir opposition from both sides,
and on various grounds. It is neither one thing nor the
other some will say ; a few Jacksonites will Lay they would
rather have the school located in Sutter Creek thau any half
way site, and tome Sutterites may express the sentiment in
favor of Jackson. But this spirit will hardly be favored by
the bulk of the taxpayers who will be called upon to foot
the bills. And a journey of two extra miles for all the
prospective high school students is decidedly preferable to a
trip of four miles for one half of the school population. The
Ledger would like to see the county high school in Jackson,
not only because it is loyal to its own town, but also because
Jackson is the populous center that will undoubtedly furnish
the greater number of high school attendants. But we can
not shut our eyes to the well-founded objections to this plan,
any more than we can be blind to the arguments from the
county seat standpoint against location in Sutter Creek, The
difficulties of the situation are not yet adequately appreciated.
They will doubtless loom up more prominently as time wears
on. There can be no funds available for starting the school
until the next tax levy is made, even if a temporary location
were selected. It is just as well to make haste slowly in
this matter. Ample time should be given to weigh all the
pros and cons of the matter before any decisive action is
taken.
There is a disposition in some quarters to ignore the ad
visory vote cast at the last election in favor of A. G. Spauld
ing for United Statee senator to succeed Frank Flint.
Spaulding was not our choice for that position, nevertheless
we believe he fairly won the indorsement of his party, and
is entitled to the support of the republican legislators just as
much as though be received the caucus nomination of his
party under the old method. It would be gross breach of
faith to turn him down, and likewise a slap at the popular
idetf of electing United States senators by direct vote. It may
be true that a man more capable of representing the state of
California in the senate of the United States might be found,
but the voters have spoken and that should settle it.

It has been slowly brought to our
understanding that the world is not
the same to all creatures, and prob
ably no experiments have tended more
to make this clear than the recent
ones by Prof. Karl Hesz, of Wueryz
burg, on the color-sense ot chickens,
pigeons, owls and kestrels. Men with
hungry chickens and pigeons were fisrt
kept an hour in a bright room to be
come accustomed to the light. The
floor was .then spread with a smooth
black cloth evenly covered wth grains
of wheat, a strong spectrum was
thrown on it from the ceiling, and
the hungry animals were turned
loose. They picked the wheat first
from the bright red, the the ultra red,
next the yellow, and finally the green.
They touched nothing in the blue and
violet because they saw nothinsr, but
on the other hand, they saw the grains
in the ultra-red that were invisible to
the men. This proved that for chickens
and pigeons the spectrum is phortened
at the violet end of the short wave
length and extended at the red end of
long-wave length. This is the effect
one might expect from wearing orange
colored glasses, and Hesz demonstrated
that fowls see through such spectacles
in the form of yellow and ' orange oil
globules imbedded in the light-sensitive
iris. To kestrels and buzzards the
brightest zone was the green instead of
red, the blue being visible. To fowls
the colors were as men see them.
The telephone disinfector of B. F.
Gardner of Chicago is an arrangement
for producing electric sparks in the
mouthpiece. Wires projecting through
the walls of the mouthpiece are con
nected with a secondary coil wound on
the ringer frame, and this causes sparks
when the alternate ringing current is
sent out on the line to ring the bell.
The "rolling tanks" of Frahm. the
Hamburg engineer, have reduced the
roll of vessels from 11 degrees on each'
beam to two degrees. U-shaped tanks
extend from port to starboard through
the hold, and the rise and fall of the
water in them neutralizes rhythmical
movement as the ship rolls.
In a novel theory of Mars, Prof.
Svante Arrhenius rejects Prof.
Lowell's view that the changing dark
spots and bands are due to vegetation,
and accepts the old suggestion that
the so-called canals are long, deep
fissures. Similar formations exist on
the earth, one extending a distance of
2,200 miles along the coasts of Peru
and Chile. Water is supposed to col
lect in the fissures or canals, and to
accumulate especially at the points
where several meet, these "lakes'* of
Sciaparelli or "oases" of Lowell be
ing explained as places where the
planet's crust has sunk though very
salt. The water is frozen by the in
tense cold The ice evaporates in the
dry air, the vapor collects as snow at
the winter pole, and the canals become
beds of dry salts, until, with the melt
ing of the snow in spring and summer,
the air ceases to be dry, and the salts
again attract moisture, turning to a
darker hue. Among objections offered
to the new theory is that it does not
satisfactorily account for the- complete
winter disappearance of the canals,
which, if really fissures, should re
main visible throughout the year.
Plantations of the rain tree of Peru,
the tamaicapsi, are claimed to offer
great possibilities as irrigation works.
The tree grows readily in any soil,
reaching large size, and has a luxuriant
foliage, with a remarkable power of
collecting and cbndensing atmospheric
moisture. Its capacity, moveover, is
increased by the unusual heat of a
drouht. The water falls from the
leaves and oozes from the trunk, and
forms vergitable rivers, which can be
led as irrigating canals to any point
desired. A single tree is estimated to
average 9 gallons of rain a day. Mak
ing liberal allowance for evaporation
and infiltration, a square mile grove
of the trees would supply for distribu
tion about 100,000 gallons of water
daily.
Up to the present time somewhat
successful attempts have been made to
measure the distances of about 360
fixed stars, but many of the determina
tions are of doubtful accuracy. No
nearer titar has been found than Alpha
Centauri of the southern hemisphere,
the third bright star in the heavens,
with a parallax of three-quarters of a
second of arc. Its distance is about
26 millions of millions of miles, and
light from it takes 4144 l 4 years to reach
us.
The crumbling of building stones is
another form of decay that we are to
attribute to the action of microscopic
organisms. At a recent Museum Con
ference at York, Eng, Dr. T. Ander
son showed that stone-decay is not duo
to wind action, and expressed the be
lief that it is not surface action at all,
but a kind of rot produced by some
low form of life like the moulds and
fungi that rot wood, canvas and other
vegetable material?. Treatment based
on abrasion or chemical theories hav
ing failed, he sought a cure of the
stones by the use of various germi
cides. The result has been as antici
pated, and in the two-years since the
experiments began the stones that
have beat resisted decay have been
those that have been treated with sul
phate of copper, bichloride of mer
cury and creosote. For a test of this
kind, however, the time is too short
to justify any denfiite conclusion.
The agitation in favor of "concealed
lighting" seems to bo rapidly gaining
strength because it represents both
light-saving and eye-saving. The glare
of powerful lamps in plain, but m»kes
it necessary to flood the air around
with a brilliant light. With the source
hidden, the eyes require much less.
The artificial illuminination of the
British Museum has been found to be
only Beven one-thousandths of day
light, that of the woolsack in the
House of Lords only six one-thous
andths, and that of the clerk's desk in
the House of Commons only one
twelve-thousandth, yet these places
are sufficiently lighted.
Sun heat has proven effective in
chemical experiments, which required
no highly refractory supporting vessel.
Using a 16-inch plano-convex lens of
20 inches focus, and placing the sub
stance to be heated in a magnesia cru
cible contained in a glass vessel from
which the air had been exhausted, A.
Stock and H. Heynemann melted
pieces of copper and cast iron almost
instantly and crystallized silicon— with
a melting point of 1450 deg.- C— in a
few seconds. The temperature was
found to be several hundred degrees
greater in a vacuum than in the same
glass vessel from which the air had
not been exhausted.
End's Winter's Troubles
To many, winter is a season of
trouble. The frost bitten toes and
ringers, chapped hands and lips, chil
blains, cold sores, red and rough skin,
prove this. But such troubles fly De
fore Bucklen's Arnica salve. A trial
convinces. Greatest healer of burns,
boils, piles, cuts, sores, eczema and
► Only 25c at Spagnoli's ; drug
store.
A Large Lemon
A lemon was handed to Steve ■ An
gove on Monday last. It was a real
lemon at that, and one of exceptional
dimensions. S« proud was the jovial
saloonkeeper over tne present that he
placed it in a conspicuous place on his
bar. The sample measures 16 inches
around one way and more than 18
inches the other.
Several years ago Mrs Angove sent
east for a small lemon tree, which she
planted as soon as she received the
same through the express. The tree
grew to such pioportions that it be
came cumbersome, and she gave it to a
relative, Orrie Jones, who is managing
the Mocking Bird ranch, near the
Mountain Spring house, on the lone
road. Mr Jones gave the tree special
care, and this season secured ,40 fire
specimens of fruit from his prized
lemon tree.

Women desiring beauty get wnderl'ul
help from Bucklen's Arnica Salve. It

Fixing Bridge
City marshal, Frank Sanguinetti,
has a force of men at work repairing
the bridge at Main and Sutter street,
north Jackson, the old planks forming
the bridge bed, were badly decayed,
and several openings in the rotted
planks made it dangerous for horses
to pass over.

Within the last week, 5.000 worth of
pennies have been ordered from the
United States sub-treasury, at San
Francisco, which is ten times more
than ever requested in a single weeK
before 1906. Assistant manager of
the sub treasury, Thomas Burns, with
tears in his eyes, spoke of the matter
and recalled the golden days when the
greatest insult to be offered a'Cali

Foot Crushed.
A press dispatch from Grass Valley,
dated the 19th instant, says :
Caleb Chirm, a miner employed at
the Cenntral mine, met with a pain
ful accident this morning just after he
had gone to work. In some manner
his foot was caught and crushed by a
heavy timber, and he suffered excru
ciating pains and was taken to his
home. Dr Brown found that the liga
ments were torn and that the foot had
been mashed out of shape. It will be
some time before the injured man will
ha"ye the use of his foot.
The victim of this mishap is well
known in Jackuon.he having worked in

Teachers' Institute-
The teachers of Amador county* will
leave Monday next for Berkeley,
where they will hold their county in
stitute in connection with the Cali
fornia teachers' association annual
meeting. Four other counties will
hold their institutes in ■ like manner.-
An erroneous impression has been cir
culated that the meeting of our county
institute at Berkeley involves heavier
expense upon the taxpayers than jif
the institute were held at some point
in Amador county. This is a mistake.
From a financial standpoint it is con
siderably cheaper outside tnan inside
the county. The instructors who come
from the outside to lecture at county
institutes are paid for their services.
and also traveling expenses. -.The cost
runs up to fully $300. • This is „ saved
by going to Berkeley this year. There
appears no solid ground for objecting
to going outside once every few yearsi
and thereby coming" in contact with
educators from different parts of s the
state, and getting an exchange of ideas
on methods of instruction,
All schools of the county will be
closed next week, not only because
of the Christmas holidays, but also
on account of the teachers' institute.
Ths Reicing of Rice.
The cultivation of rice extends back
into tho dim past, and there are no au
thentic records as to when It first be
gan. Evidence points, however.. to the
Chinese having been among the oar
llcst people to cultivate It. and such
rront value was attached to It that In
the annual ceremonial sowing of im
portant plants Inaugurated by the Kin
pcror Cuiuuoug so far back in the past
as 2SOO B. C. the rice had to.be sown
only by the emperor himself, while the
four other plants nt the ceremony
might be sown by the princes of his
family. In India rice has been culti
vated from time Immemorial. It was
Introduced at an early period Into
Syria. lSgypt and other parts of north
ern Africa. Iv more modern times rico
bus been sown in Spulu. Prance and
Italy, the first cultivation in the last
namc-d country being stated to have
been near Pisa Iv 1408. The plant is
believed to have been Introduced into
America In 1G47, when Sir William
Berkeley raised a crop of sixteen
bushels from ha'.f a bushel of seed.

"To be or no to be, that's the ques
tion," for Sutter Creek nnd Jackson
City to consider. We should not for
selfish motives bar the possibility of a
county high school. It is well enough
to argue the advantages of the
different places as to a location, but
this should be done in a fair intelli
gent and unprejuudiced way. We
understand that Sutter Creek, Amadur
lone, Plymouth, and Jackson each
have sites, temporary and permanent
to ofrer.
We should consider the location that
can do the greatest service to the
greatest number, and according to our
figuring that location is Jnckson city,
from the fact that it has the largest
number of pupils in the public school,
and is the center of population.
. From the fact that Jackson is the
county seat and has the county build
ings and if, as the Record states, the
mines of Amador county should fail,
the county seat as history proves in
other places, is the most permanent
of the county t jwna. We note an ex
ception to the character of petition
circulated in Pine Grove and Volcano
by Sutter Creek appealing to the
voters to declare tor Sutter Creek on
the grounds that by so doing it
would save the expense of another
election.
We claim that it was an unfair and
prejudiced proceeding. If such decla
ration on the part of the voters for
Sutter Creek would save this expense
why would not v similar declaration
in Jackson's favor do the same. lone
presents a more favorable offer than
any, of which we have heard from
Sutter Creeks
lone is as accessible to most of the
pupils of the county as Sutter Creek,
and offers not only a site, but a build

standing, but we do claim all that
Sutter can boast, and more too. We

SCHOOL APPORTIONMENT
Jackson, Cat. Dec. 16th, 1910.
To the Board of Trustees of Amador Conty :
Ladies and Gentlemen :— I hereby report to the first apportionment for the
school year 1910, 191L The County Auditor reports that there is $11129.11
available for apportionment; to this sum has been added $466.78, the balance
remaining in the urvapportioned County fund, which gives a total of 11595.89.
Of this amount 1 apportioned $11071.51, leaving a balance of 8524.38.
The next apportionment ■will be of state money, and will be made in
January.
Drytown receives $200 extra for 8 census children. Oneida 1200 extra for
8 census children. Plymouth $250 extra for 10 census children.
claim the center of population, and
Jackson can serve the most people at
least expense. If San Francisco could
claim as much there would be no doubt
about California receiving the I'minnm
Exposition.
If the geographical center counted,
the capital of the United States should
be in Kansas.
The editor of the Record asks in re
ply to last week's article, wherein the
fact is cited that Jackson has the
deepest gold mine in the world, if we
intend to locate a high school down in
the bowels of the earth. We answer
no, that is why we want it in Jackßon,
and not in Sutter Creek. That is a
town built in a hole in the ground,
we say to you, send your children
from out the bowels of the earth, let
them take inspiration from that old
poem, "Excelsior," and climb Sutter
hill to Jackson and to light. The
editor of the Record no doubt means
well, but one's mind becomes limited
by the surroundings, he should come
out of the hole in the ground, come to
the city of Jackson, while opportunity
is knocking at his door. Sometimes it
pays to listen to the knocker.

SAMPO MURDER
TRIAL FINISHED
Conlinuod from Jape 1
his story, substantially the same u3
the other witnesses on the same side.
He denied having struck the deceased
with a rock, or having seen him in the
roadway that night, or having had any
trouble except what occurred in the
Cavallero house or yard.
i All the testimony was in Wednesday
afternoon. The prosecution presented
no rebuttal testimony, content to allow
the alibi defense to stand as made out
by the defendant's own witnesses. It
was supported mainly by the two de
fendants,Sampo andConti.who claimed
that they played ten or twelve games
of "mora' before the dancing com
menced, which consumed considerable
time, and would tend to show that de
fendant was in the Cavallero house at
the time the homicide is alleged to
have been committed. The other wit
nesses stated that three games only
were played, occupying from twenty
minutes to half an hour.
The arguments consumed until Thurs
day afternoon. After the instructions .
of the court the jury retired for delib
eration soon after two o'clock. Hour
after hour passed, and it looked for a
while that a disagreement would be
the outcome. Once the jury filed into
court and asked for the reading of the
testimony of one of the main witnes
ses, and instructions. Again retiring
another long wait occurred. About
nine o'clock the foreman reported
that an agreement had been reached.
The jury filed into the" jury box, and <■
handed in the verdict, which was read
by the clerk, and was "We the jury
find the defendant guilty of murdei in
the second degree. ' '
It seems the only contention among
thg jurymen was as to the grade of the
crime, several holding out^for murder
in the first degree, but these w*ere
finally won over to the lesser offense.
The verdict gives general satisfac
tion, as being in accord with the facts
in the case. The penalty is not less
than ten years in the penitentiary, up
to life imprisonment.
The defendant's counsel handed in
127 instructions for the judge to sub
mit to the jury. After examining this
voluminous mass, the court gave 21 of
the instructions asked for.
Mrs. Clough Dead
A message was received in Jackscn
yesterday afternoon informing friends
of the death of Mrs Sarah Jane Clough,
at her home in San Francisco. De
ceased died at 9 p. m. Wednesday,
after a lingering illness from a com
plication of disorders, incident to old
age. She was a native of Pennsyl
vania, aged 72 years.
Funeral services will be held in San
Francisco on Saturday afternoon,
after which the remains will be for
warded to Jackson. Services will also
be held in the M. E.i, church in this
city on Monday morning at 10 o'clock,
and thereafter the interment will take
place at Pine Grove by the body of her
husband, who died many years ago.
Mrs Jos. Pnelps, a.daughter of de
ceased, was summoned hastily to the
city when the life of her mother was
despaired of, and went down on
Wednesday, arriving in time to see
her mother alive. Miss Hilda Clough
is also a daughter, and was present at
the final scene.
Mrs Clough was born in New Al
bany, Bradford county, Pa., December
28, 1838, and came to California with
her parents in the spring of 1860, when
the family settled in Nevada City. In
1867 she was married to John Herbert,
and in 1867 she and her husband went
to live in Sutter Creek.Amador county.
Herbert died in 1869. The widow
married Orson Clough January 28,
1872. Until four years ago she lived
at the Clough ranch near Pin c Grove.

TO LAND.
Sam Toy, the well-known Chinese
merchant, a member of the Leun Sien
Company of this place, who left
Angels Camp about three years ago to
visit his native country, is now, ac
cording to late advices, a quarantine
prisoner at Angels Island, where he
has been detained since October ISth,
pending the unraveling of govern*
mental red tape and the banishment
from his system of some contraband
hook-worms which it is alleged he
caught during his sojourn in the
Flowery Kingdom.
Toy was a passenger aboard the
steamship Mongolia which arrived in
San Francisco frum China on the
above date. He held a ticket entitling
him to passage, and, while to ordinary
morals there was really nothing very
mysterious about the manner of his
coming, it was unusual enough it
would seem to set working the leaven
of endless red tape for one of those
farcical human comedies, the very in
congruity of which must cause the
gods to smile, and even sometimes to
laugh when they look down.
Prior to his departure for the Orient
three years ago, Toy had his identifica
tion paper* a'l properly drawn up and
attested by Walter Tryon as notary
public, while his photograph was duly
attached and the signatures of C. H.
Woods, J. A. Ayala Joe Peirano, Geo.
Kose and several other business, men
of the town were placed upon the in
strument as witnesses to the fact that
•Sam Toy had long been a resident and
taxpayer of Angels Camp, and as
was entitled to return when he
felt so disposed.
After his sojourn and upon his re
turn to our port, Toy presented these
papers to the port official but that
worthy thought he could see a "nigger
in the fence." The fact that the china
maryfiad his credentials and that all
demands for passage had been satisfied
must have ' created doubt, for , stow
aways seem to be the rule now instead
of the exception, and a Celestial
traveling on the square is at once the
object of suspicion, so Toy was de
tained. He wrote to his brother, Ah
Toy of this town, apprising him of the
situation, an j the latter enlisted the
assistance of Walter Tryon who went
to Angels Island to look into the
manter. He identified the suspicioned
Sam Toy, as well as the papers he held,
but that was not deemed sufficient and
Mr Tryon was told that the investiga
tion would be carried . on in Angels
Camp by a corps of government in :
spectors— two white men and a China
man — arrived in town. They went to
Mr Tryoiv with official gusto and
solemn dignity and had him reiterate
his identification of Sam Toy and his
papers, and then interrogated the
other witnesses, learning incidentally
among other things the fact that Sam
was a well-to-do merchant and "owner
of considerable real estate in China
town. With this the junketeers re
turned to the port but still Sam re
mained the unwilling guest of his
Uncle Sam at Angels Island. Present
ly Ah Toy received a letter from a
Chinaman in San Francisco (not an
official) urging him to put up a certain
lee for the employment of an attorney
to handle his brother's case, volunteer
ing this advice as the only way of
securing the prisoner's release expedi
tiously. As it was palpably apparent
that a hungry attorney was on the
watch to profit by the luckless travel
ing dilemma, Ah Toy had Mr Tryon
write a- letter of inquiry to the officials.
Then came the astounding reply from
headquarters to the effect that, while
the man's credentials were all right
and he was entitled to land, the afore
said contraband wrigglers had been
found secreted in the intestinal lining
of his anatomy and that he could not
be permitted to land until he was
purged of his worms and received a
clean bill of health; that it would fur
ther be necessary, in order to insure
him against deportation, that the sum
of SIOO or a certified check for that
amount, be forthcoming at once as a
guarantee that the vermifuge used in
banishing the worms and the hospital
charges of $1.25 per day during treat
ment. shall be paid. As there seemed
no alternative but to "come through
with the dough," Ah Toy left for San
Francisco Monday, having concluded
to "throw up his hands" and submit
to the inevitable, for, while there
might be room for doubt as to whether
his brother realiy has hookworms,
there is certainly no question but that
the government has the hooks all right
with which to worm out the money,
and that the victim is pretty well
hooked up to say the least.
While it is perfectly proper that due
diligence should be exercised by the
government in guarding against fraud
or imposition, the ulterior motive for
such abnormal proceedings in this case
is bo obvious and written '. in letters
bo large that even he, 1 who, runs may
read, in the face of this abominable
system— if it may be called a system
of courtesy— it is not surprising that
.smuggling is resorted to, for the man
acting legally has but little better
chance than the one who violates the
law. It is out of this senseless net
work of capriciously elastic red-tape

lous traders in human flesh and human
weakness, the foul flies that fatten
upon graft and human delusion, are
hatched, fed and fostered— Angela Re-

Wool Activity.
With little prospect for improve
ment in the immediate future, the
local wool market is exceedingly weak
and approaches well nigh to stagna
tion. This condition, however, is said
to be prevalent throughout the entire
country, and will continue according
to the best local and eastern authori
ties on the market, until some guaran
tee against the lowering of the tariff
on wool is made. The election of a
democratic congress on November Bth,
according to a local dealer, has shat
tered almost all hope of a continued
high tariff and as a result it is claimed
that the poor conditions existing at
the present time will continue to grow
worse. That a high tariff is almost
essential to a strong wool market is
shown by the fact that at the present
time the tariff is 11 cents, while the
normal price for the fall clip is the
same amount, and the price in the
spring is 13 cents.
Locally the fall clip was normal
quality and tne yield was up to the
standard of past years. A knowledge
of these facts brought several buyers
to this county from eastern markets
but before deals of any magnitude
were under way it is understood that
they were recalled as soon as the No
vember election returns were known. —

Wasteful Practice
It has been noticed for some time
past that the railroad company has
been burofng- hrumlreds of ties along its
line on the Arnador Branch Railroad,
and many people have commented up
on what appears to ( be a wilful waste
of good wood. These ties were for
merly sold for kindling wood at 5 cents
each, and were in great demand. The
Sacramento Star,, in a recent issue,
contained tile following' item regarding
the burning of the ties:
"From> along the lines of the South
ern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads a
wail of complaint is being heard from
;the farmers.. No longer can the
farmers get fence posts at a reduced
cost. Up to the present time old rail
road ties have been sold to the farmers
for 1,7 cents apiece. When split these
made two good posts for 7>» cents a
post. The railroad is now burning the
ties, according- to the farmers. To
buy new lumber and have it shipped
would cost 2S rents to the post. The
burning ot the ties, according to the
statements of the farmers, is a new
graft of the railroads who with the
lumber companies are forcing the pro
ducers to. bow to the combine."

The Mountain Democrat has this
item of Miss Norma Smith, daughter
of Mr and Mrs Web Smith of the Ken
nedy mine : Miss JNurma Smith, the
young vocalist, who won such high
praise for her solo work at the McNeil
club concert in Sacramento last week,
is a niece of Mrs G. A. Richardson of
this city. Miss Smith has a bird-like
soprano voice beautiful in quality, and
-sings with rare taste and finish In
her two years of study with Homer
Henley in Sacramento she has brought
to her work an earnestness that is al
ready fruitful ,in results. Some of
Miss Smith's . admirers in PlacerviUe
are hopeful that she may be heard
here sometime.
Cullen James, who will be remem
bered by many in Placurville where
he spent his boyhood days, passed
away at Stockton, last week, Tuesday,
from paresis. He was a native of Dry

years o.t age. He leaves two sisters,
Mrs Adelina Combellack of this city,

Thomas N. Jones of Groveland was
acquitted on first ballot Tuesday for
shooting Jack Welsh on. his ranch on
October 19th last. *The jury were out
only ten minutes. Jones was held on
a charge of manslaughter by the jes
tiee court in the preliminary examina
tion. He was defended by attorney F.
P. Otis. There were no witnesses to
the shooting. The testimony of Jones,
the defendant, was to the effect that
he was c"allcd out of the house by
Welsh and that as soon as they got out
on the back porch, he was attacked by
Welsh who being a strong, heavy
man, used his fists with telling effect.
Jones kept backing until he had gone
about twenty feet when he drew his
revolver. At this point Welsh gave
him a heavy blow in the stomach
knocking him to the ground, when
Jones fired. The bullet wound. in
Welsh's body sustains Jones inasmuch
as it shows that the bullet ranged up
ward to a considerable degree. —

San Francisco Proud of Men
Directing Its Big Enterprise
San Francisco's organization for the
conduct of the Panama-Pacific Interna
tional Exposition may be regarded as
one of the most remarkable products
of that remarkable city. For several
years political conditions in the com
munity, through some unfortunate se
ries of coincidences, have been open
to criticism. A year ago the average
Cnllforninn of Sisklyou or San Diego
might have protested the city's right
to hold a great world's fair.
But at the proper time, when there
was made evident the need of big men
for a big undertaking, there emerged
from their places of habitual retreat
thirty of the foremost citizenß of Cali
fornia, ready and willing to assume
the burden of detail and the heavy re
sponsibilities) that the situation im
posed. Politics, opposing business in
terests, private antagonisms and feuds
n generation old were laid aside and
forgotten when there was presented
the opportunity to accomplish a gigan
tic result.
In the selection of the board of di
rectors the San Francisco Exposition
Is more fortunate than many another
daufornia* institution organized for
pecuniary profit. Practically every
branch of business is represented, nor
was there neglected the interests of
education and morality. One of the
best advertisements that San Fran
cisco has turned loose in many a day

of the Panama-Pacific Exposition.

We nto our dinner in Truckee
awaiting the narrow gage train which
had not yet arrived from Tahoe City.
With impatience we loitered about,
straining our eyes in 1 fruitless effort
to see the tram come through,. thq
narrow defile that the Truckeo riyef
has cut through for countless' nge4—
but no train was to be seen, j A''kden
sharp whistle from a motor car com
ing from Iteno, attracted our atten
tion. Almost at the same moment a
locomotive whistle sounded through
the gap we had previously been look
ing at, and a moment after the curling
smoke from the locomotive rose in
spiral columns along the banks of the
Truckee river, and our train came
thundering down upon us. . The train
stopped only for an hour, when I was
ready to return. . The engine was- of
the 'same pattern used upon broad
gauge roads save that they were much
smaller. We kept the course of the
Truckee river running along beside it
and crossing and recrossing it.- The
little stream clear as crystal flowed
with a gentle gurgling sound with- its
course onward. As the water deepened
it turned from a transparent crystaline
to the deep blue of a surging sea. As
we speed along, huge mountains rose
sheer and percipitous above. ; As we
cross the wagon road the shrill screech
fronY the locomotive echoed and re
echued as if screaming over the wilder
ness that surrounded us. ■ Then nearing
the lake, to our left, stood the rem
nants of volcanic action. Molten
matter in unique columns stood above
us.lt was nature's great field of action
that molded it into shape millions of
years before. Jagged, jutting, hang
ing, in tufts, it stood in specterous
view before us, rising into round
shape, rearing aloft the jagged spear

like points; shooting into a thousand
fantastic forms. Minarets rose above
as if rearing themselves over some an
riunt citadel where some lord of his
manor held his feudal sway. Here
wns Nature in all its granduer and
glory. The Indians that viewed it first
were gone into the shadow at.d depth
of stillness of time. It stood as an
everlasting monument to never be
forgotton. Evolution might sweep
above its head like the hanging colors
of the kaleodoscope changing every
thing and everybody, but this immu
table fragment of nature would topple
only when the earth bursts asunder
through some sweep of nature in its
last fearful action.
• Once more the whistle sounded, we
looked out of the car and the lake was
before us. It was both beautiful and
picturesque. Looking across the lake
from the California side, you see for
miles the sheer bare mountains, and
contrastingto those on this side covered
with evergreens trees and verdure.
Looking southward tne lake is fringed
by young fir and spruce, and deepening
into shadowy coves The sea-gulls
flop their white wings in ecstasy, as
they flit in play above its pellucid
waters. These are aquatic sea fowls.
Whither did they come? They are not
of migratory nature. They were
planted by the everlasting power we
know not of if they were conjunctive
with the lake itself. , The lake ..has
doubtless been the creator of some
volcano of millions of years ago, when
mephitic air swept in confusion and
chaos over this continent with fearful
fury. Old Tahoe, the greybeareded
child has gone to the happy hunting
ground, but the shadow of his Indian
spirit bears the name ' of the lake.
Twenty five years ago the legislature
squabbled, over giving the lake an
official ■ name! The ~ prestige •of Gen.
Bigler was reaching out to grasp - it,
but the Indian , whose, ancestors, trod
untrammelled around it hundreds of
years ago, held it securely in their
grasp for it is known now far and near
and ever to be called, Tahoe, after, the
venerable Indian of almost an extinct
tribe.* it' is gradually growing Into a
great «ummer resort. It is 20^,' miles
wide and 40 miles long. Real estate
is running skyward rapidly. Upon a
bulletin board I saw the announce
ment, "Lots from $1300 up." The
narrowgauge road brought In alone 40
000 this season to visit, not saying
anything about those that came in
autos, wagons etc. The time is not
far away. when the coast line -of. the
lake will be fringed with the finest
residences, and the rich man with his
millions will 101 l in the shades of its
trees and drink from the pure cold
water of the mountain lake.

of burying himself The' wire was

the death of Gravitt and asked , that

hospital from excessive drinking.

also some immense hawks. They have
had one snow ' storm and that . haa
brought wild animals down from the
mountains, and the trappers expect to
do better when the heavy snow cornea
