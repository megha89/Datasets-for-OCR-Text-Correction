The Polka.
The polka is the natural dance for
the feet of the people. Take tin evidence
its origin. A Bohemian peasant girl
' was seen dancing "out of her own
head," extemporizing from, the sheer
Joy of her heart song, tune and steps.
This she did on a Sunday afternoon in
Elbeleinltz. and an artist, one Josef
Neruda, who spied her, made>a note of
all he saw. The people of the town
adopted the dance and called it the
pulka, half step. In 1835 it reached
Prague and Vienna in 1S40; thence It
spread rapidly through Europe. When
M. Cellarius introduced it to the Pari-
sians, we hear that all else gave way
before "the all absorbing pursuit the
polka, which embraces in its qualities
the intimacy of the waltz with the vi
vacity of the Irish Jig."— Cassell's Mag
azine.
The Bone and the Singe.
Once upon a tune in a melodramatic
theatrical performance the leading man
took a fiery, untamed steed on tbe
stage. After the horse heard some of
the lines delivered by several of the
actors he began kicking the flats and
wings to pieces, sending them up
among the flies.
"Help, help!" cried the leading man.
"Nay, nay!" answered the manager.
"The horse shows great discernment
He Is trying to elevate the stage."

CHILD
Does your horse "feel his
oats"? What a difference be-
tween the grain-fed and the
grass-fed horse! The first
strong arid full of ginger, the
second flabby, weak and tired
out before he- begins. The
feeding makes the difference,
i; Children are not alike either.
One is rosy, bright-eyed, full
of life and laughter, another is
pate, weak and dull. The feed-
ing again is responsible.
Sickly children need special
feeding. They don't "feel their
oats". Scott's Emulsion adds
just the right richness to their
diet It is like grain to the
horse. The child gets new
appetite and strong digestion.
Scott's Emulsion is more

RICE WATER NUTRITIOUS.
Curious War Some .British Officers
Discovered This Fact.
;It is probable. that few occidental
cooks who prepare : rice. In. various
forms for diet ore aware that in dls
•carding the .water in which it Is boiled
they are wasting what is regarded by
the oriental as the most nutritious part
of the food. This fact was curiously
proved some ' years ' since when a de
tachment of Europeans and native
troops in India found themselves be
leaguered in a fort with insufficient ra
tions, even of rice, to enable them to
hold out until a force could march to
their relief. . .■ :•
l lt was when the officers were seri
ously debating this problem that the
natives approached them with what
was regarded as a curious solution of
the difficulty. If, proposed the latter,
the Europeans took all the rice, they,
the natives, would be quite content
with the water in which it was boiled.
The suggestion," In place of any better,
was adopted,' when it was remarked
that while the Europeans found it dif
ficult to maintain their strength on full
rations of rice the natives lost none of
then: stamina by several weeks' diet on
the water. When the proposal was
made, the action of the natives was
praised as one of great devotion to
their superiors, but the sentiment was
somewhat mollified when the discov
ery was made that the natives were
quite aware that the principal nourish
ment lay In the water. •
' Since that time Europeans In the ori
ent, following the custom of the na
tives, have given rice "water to pa
tients, particularly in cases of cholera,
as a last resort when no other food can
be retained in the stomach and usually
with good results. But the natives al
ways value this water so highly that it
is never thrown away.
In fact it would surprise many cooks
to discover how much may be done
with this apparently worthless stock.
If the rice is cooked in the oriental
fashion — that is, boiled only so long
that each grain comes out of the pan
separate and not as a sodden mass—
the water when strained off and per
mitted to cool. will become a jelly ap
proaching the consistency of blanc
mange. To suit tbe occidental palate
the water should be flavored with an
extract , or otherwise the Jelly may
have rather an insipid taste.
Sheep In Varied Clothlns;.
One of the results of the investiga
tion of n special committee of the So
ciety of Arts Into the question of book
binding goes to 'show that sheepskin
is often used by bookbinders under
very different names. They found
books bound nominally in Levant mo
rocco, hard grain . morocco, straight
grain morocco, pigskin, calfskin, croco
dile and alligator leathers, all of which
on close microscopic examination were
found to be the ordinary common
sheepskin on which had been stamped
the special (Trains and' markings of the
skins they' were got up to Imitate. Tbe
committee, however, were satisfied
that in many cases both the book
binders and the librarians had bought
these leathers under the impression
that they were buying the genuine ar
ticle.—London Globe. 1
How Russian Peasants Lire,
• Most of the Russian peasants pass a
great deal of thejr lives In workshops,
where they work, eat and sleep, the
same room sheltering a number and
probably a pig In the bargain. There
are few beds. Instead, all around the
four walls of the room Is fixed what
may be literally described as a bench.
It is made of wood, and at this works
the peasant by day, and on it he sleeps
by night each man at his own spot
The conditions of the Russian work
shop or factory and the Russian prison
and military barracks, so far as In
terior arrangements are concerned, are
akin. Chairs there will also be and a
table, rudely fashioned, as a rule, by
the men themselves.— Saturday Re

Twentieth Century Medicine.
The twentieth century has almost a
free field In medicine. Although much
has been accomplished in the treatment
of diseases, the science is still largely
experimental, and there is room for a
host of discoveries. Perhaps by the
time this century is ended there will be
a lymph or an antitoxin or some sort
of treatment for every ill the flesh is
heir to, so that a few vaccinations and
other treatments will guarantee imniu
jiity for a long period. Then centena
rians will be as common as blackber
ries and a man will be young at eighty.

THE POINT OF THE JOKE.
It Was Difficult For the Englishman,
bnt He Finally Saw It.
A party of Englishmen were In Chi
cago sightseeing some time ugo. They
were entertained at dinner by some
Chicago Englishmen who have lived In
America long enough to have a keen
appreciation of the American idea of a
Joke. During the evening all the mem
bers of the party told stories or sung
Bongs I and entertained according to
their several abilities.
I One of the English visitors could see
nothing funny in the stories told by the
Chicago Englishmen. Every time one
of them would tell a good American
story at which most of the party would
laugh uproariously this particular Eng
lishman would adjust his monocle to
his eye and, looking wonderingly
around the table, would remark, "But
I say, I don't see anything in that to
laugh at, y' knaw."
j . Ouo oC. tho Chicago men . linully re
cited an original poem. The poem told
of an Englishman who had come to
America and after being in this coun
try only a short time had died and gone
to another und much warmer country.
Ten years pussed, and one day an Imp
passing that way heard the English
man laughing uproariously. v
"Why, what are you laughing at?" in
quired the Imp.
"Oh, oh, oh, such a funny story as 1
heard In America I Oh, It was so fun
ny!" laughed the victim, and he held bis
hands to his side and almost doubled
up. with merriment.
"A story you heard! Why, you've
heard no story." said the Imp. "You've
been dead ten years."
"Yes, yes. I know, 1 know," cried the
man. "But I've Just seen tbe Joke."
This poem set the table in a roar.
Amid all (he laughing and shouting
the obtuse visitor adjusted his monocle
and drawled out, "But, I say, I don't
see anything funny in that, y* knaw."
"No," replied tho man who' had read
the poem as quick as a flash. "Of
course you don't You haven't been
dead ten years." And even the obtuse
Englishman saw the point— Chicago

A COMEDIAN'S TRICK.
Base hr Which lie" Escaped Arrest
and Had Ills Debt* Paid.
Many amusing stories are told of Joe
Halnes, a comedian of the time of
Charles 11., sometimes called "Coonf
Homes.' It Is said that he was arrested
one morning by two bailiffs for a debt
of £20, when he saw a bishop to whom
he was related passing along In bis
coach. With ready resource he imme
diately saw a loophole for escape, and,
turning to the men, he said, "Let me
speak to his lordship, to whom I am
well known, and he will pay, the debt
and your charges into the bargain."
The bailiffs thought they might ven
ture this, ns they were within two or
three yards of the coach, and acceded
to the request Joe boldly advanced
and took off his bat to the bishop, i His
lordship ordered the coach to stop,
when Joe whispered to the divine that
the two men were suffering from euch
tarapWof conscience' that hV feared
they would hang themselves, suggest
ing that his lordship should Invite them
to hiß , house and promise to satisfy
them. The bishop agreed, and, calling
to the bailiffs, he said, "You two men
come to me tomorrow morning, and 1
will satisfy you."
The men bowed and went away
pleased, and early the next day waited
op. his lordship, who, when they were
ushered In, said, "Well, my men. what
are these scruples of conscience?"
"Scruples?" replied one of them. "We
have no scruples! We are bailiffs, my
lord, who yesterday arrested your cou
sin, Joe Halnes, for a debt of £20. and
your lordship kindly promised to satis
fy us."
The trick was strange, but the result
was stranger, for his lordship, either
appreciating Its cleverness or consider
lag himself bound by the promise he
had unintentionally given, there and
then settled with the men in full.

Pomegranates, cranberries, blackber

cherries and medlars are astringents.
Grapes, peaches, strawberries, whortle

TALKING TO ONESELF.
Soliloquies Are Rare Because We
Fear They Mean Madness.
Talking to oneself has this obvious
advantage over any other form of ora
tory or gossip: One is assured of a
sympathetic audience. But it has also
this peculiar drawback: It is supposed
to be one of the early symptoms of in
sanity., Wrongly so perhaps. A mad
doctor might rule the habit out of his
diagnosis. Nevertheless the popular
belief Is firmly rooted, and it is for
fear of this belief doubtless that. we
talk to ourselves even as we dress our
hair with, straws so rarely.' .
It maybe said that we never do ad
dress ourselves at any length except in
the delirium of a fever. In moments
of ordinary excitement of course we
utter to the wind some sort of appro
priate ejaculation. Delight wrings
from us a cry of "Hurrah!" or "Thank
heaven!" even though there be none by
to echo us. Similarly in any disgust
we emit one of those sounds whose
rather poor equivalents in print are
"Ugh!" and "FaughP* and "Tutr Much
further than this we do not go. "Why,
what an ass am I!" cries Hamlet In
one of his soliloquies. Omitting the
first B word and transposing the last
two, the ordinary modern man 'does
often soliloquize to that extent But
be could no more soliloquize to Ham
let's extent than he could speak in
decasyllabics. .
Nor is there any reason to suppose
that that class of the community with
which, contemptuous of his own fluen
cy, Hamlet ] compared himself is or
ever was . more prone to soliloquize
than any other. In tho matter of solil
oquies we cannot accept Hamlet as an
unbiased authority. We merely find in
him the possible origin of the belief
that talking to oneself is a bad sign.—

Bhikoff. He noticed one of the servant
ma,ids particularly, and, though she
was not handsome; she caught his fan
cy. Her name, the prince' told the czar,
was Martha. She had been a servant
in the bouse of a Lutheran minister of
Marienburg, and when that city was
captured by the troops of Russia she
had been taken prisoner by General
Bauer, who had passed her over to the
prince, whose servant she was. The
count politely made a present of her to
the czar, who eventually married her.
William . Cobbett, the great writer,
when he was only twenty-one years of
age one morning chanced to see a bux
om servant girl busily engaged in
washing the family linen. The girl
was pretty, so Cobbett spoke to her,
learned her name and the same even-
Ing called upon her parents and said
he would like to marry their daughter.
The parents of the girl informed the
young man that they had no objections
to him as their son-in-law, but that he
would have to wait until their daugh
ter was of a marriageable age. Five
years later Cobbett true to his early
love, married her.
Souther on Wordsworth.
Of Wordsworth, Southey writes In
1808, says Harold S. Scott in The At
lantic: "He has written a masterly
poem called 'The White Doe of Rilston
Hall; or. The Fate of the Nortons.' The
poem is incomparably fine. It would
amuse you to hear how he talks of his
own production." His entire and intense
selfishness exceeds anything you could
have conceived. I am more amused at
it than offended; not being sufficiently
attached to him to feel pain at perceiv
ing his faults, and yet respecting him
far too much on the average of his
qualities to be disgusted. It is so pure
and unmixed a passion In him that Ben
Jonson would have had him In a play
had he been his contemporary."

The little girl who was visiting at a

A HARD PROPOSITION
SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION OF THE
FOURTH DIMENSION.
To the L»y Blind It Would Appear as
Though This Measure of Space
' Were . the .. Ability to Disappear
Through Stone Walla.
Suppose a world consisting of a
boundless flat plane to be inhabited
by reasoning beings who can move
about at pleasure on the plane, but are
not ■ able to . turn , their heads j up or
down or even. to see or think of such
terms as above them and below them,
and things around them can be push
ed or pulled about In any direction, but
cannot be lifted from the plane. '. Peo
ple and things can pass around each
other, but cannot step over anything.
These dwellers in "flntland" could con
struct a plane geometry which would
be exactly like ours in being based on
the axioms of Euclid. Two parallel
straight lines would never meet, though
continued indefinitely.
But ! suppose that the surface on
which these beings live. Instead of be
ing an Infinitely extended plane, Is
really the surface of an immense globe
like the earth on which we live. It
needs no knowledge of geometry, but
only an examination of any globular
object— an apple, for example— to show
that if we draw a line as straight as
possible on a sphere and parallel to It
draw a small piece of a second line,
ond continue this In as straight a line
as we can, the two lines will meet
when we proceed In either direction
one-quarter of the way around the
sphere. For our "flatland" people these
lines would both be perfectly straight
because the only curvature would be
In the direction downward, which they
could never either perceive or discover.
To explain hypergeometry proper we
must first set forth what a fourth di
mension of space means and show how
natural the way by which It may be
approached. , We continue our analo
gy from "flatland." In this supposed
land let us make a cross— two straight
Unes intersecting at right angles. The
Inhabitants of this land understand
the cross perfectly and conceive of it
Just as we do. But let us ask them to
draw a third line intersecting the same
point and perpendicular to both the
other lines. They would at once pro
nounce this absurd and impossible. It
is equally absurd and impossible to us
if we require the third line to be
drawn on the paper. But we would re
ply, "If you allow us to leave the paper
or flat surface, then we can eolve the
problem by simply drawing the third
line through the paper perpendicular
to its surface."
Now, to pursue the analogy, suppose
that after we have drawn three mutu
ally perpendicular Unes some being
from another sphere proposes to us the
3ame*lßnfl?-^fgSrtJ» Hne through the
of the lines already lcnla r to 'all three
answer him In the S^g^^jE&rtft'Tlie 1 -
Inhabitants of "flatland" answered us:
"The problem is impossible. You can
not draw any such line in space as we
understand it" If our visitor conceived
of the fourth dimension, he. would re
ply to us as we replied to the "flat
land" people: "The problem is absurd
and impossible if you confine your line
to space as you understand it But for
me there Is a fourth dimension In
space. Draw your line through that di
mension, and the problem will be solv
ed. This is perfectly simple to me; It Is
Impossible to you solely because your
conceptions do not admit of more than
three dimensions."
Supposing the Inhabitants of "flat
land" to be Intellectual beings as we
are, it would be interesting to them to
be told what dwellers of space in three
dimensions could do. Let us pursue the
analogy by showing what dwellers In
four dimensions might do. Place a
dweller of "flatland" inside a j circle
drawn on • his plane and ask him to
step outside of tt without breaking
through It He would 'go all around,
and, finding every inch of it closed, be
would say it was impossible from the
very nature of the conditions. "But"
we would reply, "that is because of
your limited conceptions. We can step
over it"
"Step over itl". he would exclaim. "I
do not know what that means. I can
pass around anything if there is a way
open, but I cannot imagine what you
mean by stepping over it"
But .we should simply step over the
line and reappear on the other side.
So if we confine a being able to move
In a fourth dimension in the walls of a
dungeon of which the sides, the floor
and the celling were all impenetrable
he would step outside of it without
touching any part of the building Just
as easily as we could step over a cir
cle drawn on the plane without touch-
Ing it He would simply disappear
from our view like a spirit and perhaps
reappear the next moment outside the
prison. To do this he would have to
make a little excursion in the fourth
dimension.— Professor Simon Newcomb
In Harper's Magazine.

There is only one one way to cure deaf

ed condition of the I mucous lining of
the Eustachian tube. When this tube
gets inflamed you have a rumbling
sound of imperfect hearing, and when
it is entirely closed deafness is the re
suit, and unless the inflamation can be
taken and this tube restored to its nor
mal condition, hearing will be destroy
ed forever; nine cases out of ten are
caused by catarrah, which is nothing
but an inflamed condition of the

The Magnificent Remise of a Got-
eraor of Missouri.
While Robert Stewart was governor
of Missouri a steamboat . man was
brought in from the penitential as an
applicant for a pardon. He was a large,
powerful fellow, and when the govern
or looked at him ho seemed strangely
affected. He scrutinized him long and
closely. Finally he signed the docu
ment that restored the prisoner to lib
erty. Before he handed it to him he
said, "You . will commit some other
crime and be in the penitentiary again,
I fear." .". 1 .. ;
The man solemnly promised that he
would not- The governor looked doubt
ful, mused a few minutes and said:
"You will go back on the river and
be a mate again, I suppose?" *
The man replied that he would.
"Well, I want you to promise me one
thing," resumed the governor. "1 want
you to pledge your word that when you
are mate again you will never take a
billet of wood in your hand and drive
a sick boy out of a bunk to help you
load your boat on a stormy night" '
The steamboat man said he would
not and inquired what the governor
meant by asking him such a question.
The governor replied: "Because some
day that boy. may become a governor,
and you may want him to pardon yon
for a crime. One dark, stormy night,
many years ago, you stopped your boat
on the Mississippi river to. take on a
load of wood." There was a boy. on
board who was working ■ his passage
from New Orleans to St Louis, but he
was very sick of fever and was lying In
a bunk. You had plenty of men to do
the work, but you went to that boy
with a stick of wood in your hand and
drove him with blows and curses out
into the wretched night and kept him
toiling Uke a slave until the load was
completed. I was that boy. Here Is
your pardon. Never again be guilty of
such brutality."
The man, ' cowering and hiding his
face, went out without a word.

LAW POINTS.
■ A contract made with a firm is In its
legal effect one made with each mem
ber of the firm (SI Ma App. Rep. 337).
I In order to maintain an action for
breach of an express warranty one
must establish that the warranty was
relied on (53 N. E. Rep. 1086). i .
That persons may be liable as part
ners to third persons It is not necessa
ry that they shall be strictly partners s
as between themselves (59 N. E. Rep.
569). . .....•: . , .' .
Though a contract Is signed in the
name of an individual, it may be
shown that it was executed by a firm
using such Individual name as a firm
name (59 N. E. 569).
. A partner cannot give a chattel mort
gage upon his interest in a firm's assets
to secure an individual debt as against
the claims of creditors of the partner
ship (60 S. W. Rep. 1055).
A creditor may lawfully receive se
curity from an Insolvent debtor, but it
is not permissible to do so for the pur
pose and with the Intention of defraud
ing other creditors (85 N. W. Rep. 75).
The measure of damages for refusal
to receive purchased goods is the dif- '
f erence between the contract price and
the market price, at the place of deliv
ery or cost of return (84 Mo. App. Rep.
67). . .
Where a written contract has been
made by the express direction of a
party and for his benefit such party
will be bound by it although he has
not himself signed it (91 111. App. Rep..
230).

TO CORRESPONDENTS.
We look to the friends of the Ledger to keep
us posted concerning events ot public Interest
happening in any part of the county. Our reg
ular correspondents will be furnished with
writing material and stamps for this purpose.
Births, deaths, marriages, accidents, amuse
ments, mining and other industrial progress,
social topics, new buildings, persons leaving
or coming into the county, are always accept,
able. Give details of important items, no
matter in how rough a'shapi. Avoid personal
remarks that might give oi-nse. Visitors be
tween towns in the cor.- -y need not be men
tioned, but visits from or 10 places beyond the
county may be recorded.
Registration of voters drags
slowly. The citizens have not
warmed up to • their political work
yet. There is no doubt, . however,
that more interest will be taken in
the coming campaign for local of
ficers than has been known for many
years. Amador county needs a
change. This is . not saying any
thing specially derogatory to the
party in power. It has been repeat
edly demonstrated by experience
that when a party has been con
tinued in power in local affairs for a
' long period, it becomes arrogant and
domineering. Cliques are formed
for the purpose of controling the
politics and dispensing the official
pap. The nabobs in office are apt to
imagine they own the county as far
as the distribution of favors is con
cerned, Schemes are concocted
having for their object the continu
ance of themselves in their comfort
able berths. Now, when matters
reach such a . state — when men
elected to positions of public trust,
begin to think they are greater than
the power that elected them — it is
aboi t time to disabuse their minds
of .their hifalutin notion's. Next
fall the, people will call back the
authority they have temporarily de
gated to their servants. They will
demand an account of their steward
ship. And if the taxpayers are
alive to their own interests there
will be a lively shaking up of the
dry bones of democracy. The reign
of cliquism will be relegated into
"innocuous dissuetude" for the time
being- at least, by the introduction
of new blood.
WE"aYe~ in receipt ot a circular"
from the headquarters of the Trans
vaal League of California requesting
us to circulate a petition to be pre
sented to congress in behalf of the
Boer cause, with the object of se
curing the passage of a resolution
by congress expressive of its sym
pathy for that side of the South
African trouble. We are perfectly
aware that the majority of the
American people are in sympathy
with the Boer cause. As individuals
they have a right to sympathize
with whichever side they believe to
be right. But they are carrying
their individual sympathies al
together too far when they ask the
government of the United States to
take sides in the quarrel. It is not
the province of the United States
to interfere with the troubles of
other nations. We would resent
any interference — even in the shape
of a simple resolution of sympathy —
on the part of any foreign nation
with the Fillipinos in their struggle
for what they term independence.
The United States has enough to do
to attend strictly to its own busi
ness. We have enough troubles of
our own, without mixing up in those
of other warring nations. Let the
democrats, if they please, in their
desperation for a living issue upon
which to hang their hopes of suc
cess, take up the Boer fight. Any
thing to distract and annoy the ad
ministration is their motto. - The
government of the United States is
not in the hands of incompetents.
'It cannot afford to indorse the
policy — contrary to all traditions of
the past — that it is the- business of
this nation to take part in every
squabble that may arise in any
quarter of the world.
The little town of Anderson, with
two or three hundred population,
and 01 ly $90,000 of taxable proper
ty, is talking of incorporating. The
utmost that could be raised, by
property tax, without resorting to
bonds, would be $675. That is cer
tainly a handsome income -upon
which to set up a city government.
By far the greater part of the agita
tion for the incorporation of small
towns the taxable wealth of which is
utterly inadequate to support a city
regime, comes from the newspapers.
The local newspaper would be the
. principal beneficiary of the city gov
ernment idea. As a rule the local
papers are not to be censured for
advocating a movement which is for
their particular benefit. Generally
speaking, the support accorded vol
untarily from the business men of
these small towns is barely sufficient
to keep the wolf from the editor's
door, and even this is often looked
upon as a case of charity. No won
der, therefore, that the editor when
it comes to the incorporation issue,
is found on that sk'e which promises
to aid materially in placing his busi
ness on a sound financial basis. By
incorporation, the citizens are forced
to contribute, according to their
taxable property, toward the main
tenance of /the local journal.
FACTS TO BE REMEMBERED.
The following facts touching mat
ters in relation to the election next
fall should be borne in mind by vot
ers. We hope our readers will cut
this piece out, and preserve it for
reference. It may be the means of
saving some citizens from losing
their votes this year through inat
tention. . Our republican- friends
must remember that the democrats
have a decided advantage in the
way of getting their partisans nat
uralized and registered. The ma
chinerj' of government is in their
hands. This amounts to an organ
ization whose special business it is
to see that voters are qualified to
participate in the coming election.
Naturally the officials will work to
that end. It is a perpetual cam
paign with them, and in line with
their duty. It may be said that
they are supposed, so far as their
official character is concerned, to be
non-partisan, and represent all alike.
This is all very well in theory, but
it does not work in practice. A
democratic official, anxious to suc
ceed himself, will endeavor to get
his own party friends in the voting
line in preference to those who are
not of his way of thinking. The
same might be said with equal truth
of republican officials. Under the
circumstances therefore it behooves
republicans, through their political
clubs and in their private capacity,
to see to it that every citizen of their
political faith is qualified to exercise
the franchise at the next election.

Cecil Rhodes is dead, and in his
death one of the greatest figures of
modern times has passed into his
tory. He did not live, long enough
to realize the dream of his life, a
united South Africa, patterned after
the United States of America.
Nurturing these ambitious yet
patriotic schemes, it is not surpris
ing that he awakened antagonisims.
Every man who has strived to work
out vast schemes of political im
port, as he did, must necessarily
meet with bitter opposition. No
name is more execrated among tha
burgher population of South Africa
today than that of Cecil Rhodes. To
the plottings of his vigorous mind
they ascribe — whether rightly or
wrongly we do not say— all their
recent sorrows. He was shut up in
Kimberley — the diamond city which
owes its life and prosperity to his
financial genius — during its long
siege by the Boers, and Oom Paul
offered a big sum for his capture.
The vast territory in the heart of
Africa called Rhodesia was named
after him. And one of his cherished
plans of a Cape to Cairo railroad jis

_ Suit was brought to declare a part
nership i<i - the Maximilian mine sit
uated in Suttor Creek mining district,
Amador county, arising from the de
velopment thereof, and for an account
ing of tho proceeds of the sale of said
mine. Judgment went for the defend
ants in the court below, from which,
and an order denying plaintiff's motion
for a new trial, the appeal is taken. In
1893, and prior thereto, George Allen,
dow deceased, owned the mine in ques
tion, containing about eight and a half
acres of surface, with a 1500-foot lode,
and the plaintiff, by permission of
Allen, prospected the mine and in May,
ISIH. entered into an agreement in
reference to the, working of : the same,
which the plaintiff claims to have been
a partnership agreement, bi^t on the
part of the defendants it is contended
to have been an agreement to allow the
plaintiff, as a practical miner, to work
the mine, furnishing the mill, ma
chinery and implements for that pur
pose, and paying all expenses, and if
anything should be realized' over such
expenses that the net proceeds if any
should be divided between the plaintiff
and the owner of the mine. The court
found, on all the issues presented,
against the claim of the plaintiff, in
reference to a partnership. The main
contention on the appeal is that the
findings are not supported by the .evi
dence. The evidence is quite volumin
ous, but we have examined it quito
carefully and the most that can be said
in favor of appellant's contention is
that there Is a substantial conflict in
reference to the alleged partnership;
and in such case it is a rule of this
court, so well recognized as not to re
quire cases to be cited, that the find
ings must be allowed to stand.
Many errors are assigned by appellant
in the admission of evidence and refusal
to strike out evidence, j Those urged
on the appeal relate mostly to im
peaching i evidence, and particular
stress is laid upon the questions put to
the impeaching witoess, the following
being a sample: "Q. Mr. Cleveland,
about July, 1895, at the Maximilian
mine, In the presence of yourself and
Mr. Bernardls and Roily Noe, did Mr.
Bcrnardis tell you that he had just had
George Allen's word to work the mine;
he had no agreement or arrangement
with him, but that Bernardls expected
Allen to do the right thing with him if
he sold the mine, or words to that ef
fect?" The objectionable part of the
question, as contended by appellant, is
adding, '.'or words to that effect." In
reference to the rule of impeachment
,, — — _^uj cuniraurcwr^ eviat.^^,
the appellant may be technically cor
rect in his contention that the same
question should be propounded to the
impeaching witness, without the addi
tion of other words, as those asked the
witness to be impeached; but in this
case, however, the witness sought to
be Impeached was also a party in inter
est. By the liberal rules of the code,
parties to an action, with certain ex
ceptions, are allowed to testify in their
own behalf. One of the exceptions in
which they can not testify is where the
action is found "ufton a claim or de
mand against the estate of a deceased
person, as to any matters of fact oc
curring before the death of. such de
ceased person. " (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
1880.) In this case the action, not
being technically founded upon a claim
against the estate of George Allen, de
ceased, the plaintiff was permitted to
testify. In his testimony, in reference
to the alleged agreement between him
self and George Allen, deceased, he re
peats several times that "no one else
was present." Thus he is given full
sweep to give his version of the trans
action, whereas the lips of the other
party to it are sealed in death. The
purpose of the rule excluding the testi
mony of a party, where the action is
founded upon a claim or demand
against the estate of a deceased person
is very obvious. It was greatly to the
advantage of the plaintiff that he was
not excluded from being a witness in
his own behalf, and under such cir
cumstances rules in reference to the
admission of evidence should not be too
rigidly enforced. Such rules are de
signed to aid in arriving at the' truth,
and not for the purpose of suppressing
the truth. Aside from the question of
impeachment, strictly speaking, the
plaintiff himself being a party to the
action, it was competent to prove, his
statements and admissions maio against
his own interest.
In the examination of witnesses and
admission of testimony, a wide margin
of discretion must be allowed the tyial
court In order to accomplish the main
purpose in view, that is to elicit the
truth.
Upon the whole we see no error or
improper ruling of the court below .in
this case affecting the substantial
rights of the appellant.
The judgment and order are affirmed.

says J. R. Holly, real estate, Insurance

fore using Kodo Dyspepsia Curq' . she
could not eat an ordinary meal without
intense suffering. She is now entirely
cured. Several physicians and 'many
remedies had failed to give relief."

Work on Dams.
A' great deal of work is contemplated
by the Standard Electric Company on
the storage reservoirs at Blue Lakes
.» xM-acnr— rtvet— Ttre-vutmTrg * °ft»-.am_
At Hear 'river a force of at least fifty
men is to. be put to work earlj next
month, or as soon as the weather will
permit, and the number will bs,'rein
forced as the season advances. At
Blue Lakes the commencement of
operations will be delayed longer, owing
to the suow conditions. It is reported
that 400 men will bo employed there
this summer, In past seasons Carsen
has been the center from which nearly
all the workmen for this point, have
been drawn, owing mainly to lack of
transportation facilities on this side.
This year an effort is to be made to
make Jackson the point from whence
the men will be drawn. If this can be
accomplished, it means a considerable
accession of business to this town. A
stage line from Jackson to Blue Lakes
would no doubt result in securing this
trade. To keep up a working force of
that number of men ought to be ' suf
ficient to make a stage lino twice a
week profitable. It is by looking out
to catch these opportunities of busi
ness that much may be done toward
building up the town. The trade
naturally belongs to us, and we hope
something will be done toward secur
ing it.

KOTICE-.^
When you are about to buy a suit
of clothes, it would be absurd to go
to* a carpenter's shop. When in
need of medicine, you would not call
on the blacksmith to prescribe f^or
you. To reasonable people it. will
appear that to -buy -a suit there' is
but one place, and that is the tailor
shop, where your suit can be fitted
on you before being made up; and
where you can select your poods,
not from a piece of scrap on paper,
where in nine cases out of ten when
your suit arrives it isn't at all what
you selected. If you buy it home
you can select your goods from a
large assortment of piece goods, and
can see what you are getting for
your money. Your ready made
suits are pressed and remodeled with
no extra charge; this I guarantee.
Remember mine is the only place in
Jackson where you can have this
done free of charge.
Have just received a brand new
line of spring and summer goods all
ready made and to be made up to
order. Men's, Youth's and child-
ren's clothing of the latest styles.
Trusting to receive a call from
you, and thanking you for your past
favors, and soliciting the same in

; Daniel - McCarthy Blows Out His Brains.
The following account taken from
the Sacramento Record- Union of the
23d instant, will bo, read with melan
choly interest by many of our readers.
Tim deceased made monthly trips to
Amador, county on business for the
firm which he represented:
Daniel McCarthy, a traveling man in
the employ of Adams, Booth & Co. for
many years, and well known through
out the northern half of the state,
committed suicide shortly before 3
o'clock this morning in the rear of the
Commercial saloon, 722 X street,- by
shooting himself with a pistol.
Messrs. Grant & Warren, proprietors
of the place, state that McCarthy had
beon in thu saloon several times dur
ing the night, and at the time ho com
mitted the act had been thereabout an
hour. Thoy had never seen him in
better spirits, apparently, and there
was nothing in his appearance or nmu
nerto iudicaitt that ho was not in a
perfectly normal condition.
,Nobody saw him when he fired the
fatal shot, apd death was instantaneous.
Coroner McMullen . was notified at
once, and his deputies promptly took
charge of the body.
It was found that the deceased had
shot himself in the head, the bullet
passing completely through his brain.
Mr. McCarthy was about 27 or 28
years of age, and, so far as could be
ascertained, was a single man. A
brother of his is a resident of Latrobe,
El Dorado county.
He also leaves a sister In this city, a
Mrs. Hanford, the widow of Engineer
Han ford of the Placer vllle Railroad,
who died a fow years since.
tuii-.i A Rich Find-
"I was troubled ' for several years
with chronic indigestion and nervous
debility," writes P. J. Green, of Lan
clstor. N. H., "No remedy helped me
until I began Using Electric Bitters,
which did me more good than all the
medicines I ever used. They have
also kept my wife in excellent health
for years. She thinks Electric Bitters
are just splendid for female troubles:
that they are a grand tonic and invig
orator for weak, run-down woman. No
other medicine can take its place in our
family." Try them. Only 50c. satis
faction guaranteed by D. B. Spagnoli.
.No headache, no . gastritis, follows
the use of "Jesse Moore" pure whisky.
It does one good. There Is none other
to equal it. r. '.^;

The pipe has to be cemented solid in

been caused by the late heavy rains on
account of the accumulation of water

on the teamster's ranch beyond Mokel

has arisen between the teamster and
the company which has resulted in

THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MARCH 28, 1902.
THE MACQUARRIE CASE.
Proceedings Being Watched With Much
Interest.
Much interest has been awakened
throughout the county in the case of
Neil A. Macquarrie, the Jackson
lawyer, who is in jail under a felony
charge, committed in passing an al
leged fictitious check upon Joseph
Glukfeld, the clork in the Red Front
store. Macquarrie was arrested on
Sunday, the 16th of March. His
bonds were fixed at $1500. There was
considerable comment at the .time
about the exorbitant amount of the
bonds, and the talk since has only
served to intensify and confirm the
sentiment at first expressed. ' We are
always In favor of upholding the law,
and believe that persons found guilty
of fraudulent practices should be pun
ished. But at the same time we con
tend that they ought not to bo subject
ed to needless punishment before they
are adjudged guilty by a jury of their
peers. The fundamental law of the
state, and of the United States, de
clares, "excessive bail shall not be re
quired." The only object of bail
bonds is to insure the attendance of
the accused for trial. If bonds of $500
would accomplish this end, all de
mands above that sum is excessive.
It will not do to say that a person
would bo as likely to go on a bond' for
$1500 as for $500. There is no reason
in suce a line of argument. Now after
Macquarrio had remained in jail under
the original complaint for ten days,
without any action whatever takon
thereon, a new complaint was filed on
Wednesday, the 26th, and he was
taken before justice Goldner in the
sheriff's office for arraignment. He
pleaded not guilty, and examination
was set for next Monday. The funny
part of it was that at the same time
the bail bond was reduced from $1500
to $1250. Of course, this reduction
made! no difference to the defendant.
It was just as hard to give $1250 as
$1500. But the reduction was an
acknowledgment that the bail bad
been placed on too elevated a plane.
It- was an admission that the, public
mutterings on the street about ex
horbitant bonds were well founded.
A. Caminetti and D. B. Spagnoli ap
peared as attorneys for the defendant.
We have examined the complaint
under which the case is n6w being
prosecuted. It alleges tbat on the 20th
day of February 1902, at Jackson, the
defendant, N. A. Macquarrie, com
mitted the crime of felony, to wit:
''Passing a fictitious check with intent
tp defraud. The said N. A. Mac
quarrio, at the time and place afore
said, wilfully and unlawfully, with the
intent to prejudice, damage, and de
fraud Joseph Glukfeld, uttered, pub
lished and passed to him as true and
genuine, a fictitious check, apparently
genuine and of legal efficacy, ; knowing
the* said check to be fictitious; said
check bearing date the 20th day of
February, 1902, and drawn on the
Farmers and Merchants bank of
Stockton; Cal.,' for the sum of $50, and
purporting to bo the check of an indi
vidual, to wit, J. W. D. Singleton,
when in fact there was no such indi
vidual in existence."
The complaint is drawn under sec
tion 476 of the penal code, .and the
punishment Is not less than one nor
more than 14 years.

Report that the South Spring Hill
has Changed Hands— To Operate
the Fremont and Gover.
Keystone.— The new mill of the
Keystone at Amador City was started
up last week. Sixty stamps are now
dropping steadily at this old stand-by —
the longest lived mine in the county.
It was at the Keystone that quartz
mining in Amador county was started
in the early fifties. And after fifty
years of activity, the mine stands to
day.with a larger equipment than at
any previous poriod of its checkered
history. The ore is lower grade, it is
true, than in its bonanza days, but
with tho ample milling capacity with
which it is now provided it is believed
tbat it can be made to pay a fair profit.
The mill is run with electric power,
and the managers are well satisfied
with it.
Fremont and Gover'.—Prepara
tions are being made to operate these
consolidated claims on a large scale.
Heavy hoisting machinery is to be
erected over both shafts. Those works
will be equal to, if not superior, to any
thing at present existing in this county.
Some idea of tho magnitude of these
works may be gained from the' Fact
that some of the timbers for the gal
lows frame over each shaft will be
nearly 100 feet in length. The grading
for' these -hoists is about completed.
The enginos and boilers and air com
pressors will be in keeping with those
powerful works. A sixty stamp mill is
talked of in the near future. The site
has been selocted about midway be
tween the two shafts. Large ore
bodies have been found of low grade,
but which it is believed can be made to
pay by working largo quantities of it.
The mine is now giving employment to
between 70 and 80. men, 20 of whom are
miners, as rock is being crushed at the
Pocahontas mill near Dry creek.
South Spring Hill. — It is freely
reported around Amador that the
South Spring Hill mine has changed
hands. That Mr. Kelly, oue of the
Boston stockholders, has secured a con
troling interest. He was out hero a
short time back looking into the af
fairs of the mine. All reports tend to
prove that this is one of tho best prop
erties in the county. All it needs is
a more liberal expenditure of capital in
its development.' A new shaft so situ
ated that both the South Spring Hill
and Median can be operated through
It is the great dissideratum. This we
understand is to be undertaken at an
early date. Amador City as a mining
center is rapidly improving. With the
Keystone, South Spring Hill, Gover
and Bunker Hill all in active opera
tion, there must be between 300 and
400 men employed in this thriving
camp. ■
Wildman — The prospects of this
mine, we are pleased to state, have im
proved greatly of late. A body of
good milling ore has been found in the
lowest level of the Wildman ground,
upon which ten stamps of the mill have
been kept running. The yield has
been satisfactory, and justifies the be
lief that the Wildman-Mahoney has
many years of activity as a dividend
paying property in store for it.
New Western — A correspondent
sends us the following: The New West
ern Mining Company of Plymouth,
which has been milling the large ore
pile at that place, has changed owner
ship. Frank Moffitt goes entirely out
and is succeeded by W. E. Dargie of
the Oakland Tribune. Mr. Dargio in
tends to start the plant in operation in
a few days and to make some extensive
improvements in its capacity.

Suit Over Blue Lakes Stock.
A' complaint, which was signed by
James E. Damon on October 17, 1901,
was filed in the superior court yester
day. In it the plaintiff says that he
owns 250 shares of the stock of the
Blue Lakes Water Company, which
was Incorporated in 1887; that a cor
poration called Blue Lakes Water Com
pany, incorporated in 1891, received
the other company's property; that
each stockholder is entitled to receive
four shares of stock in the ntw com
pany for each share which .he held in
the olil, and that Damon consequently
is entitled to 1000 shares. He asks the
superior court to order that 1000
shares bo issued.
Damon also wants $1000 from W.
Frank Pierce for exemplary damages
on account of Pierce s alleged wrong
doing. He says that his stock in the
old company as well as that of other
stockholders was held in trust by J. S.
Emery and Robert McF. Doble, who
were the president and secretary re
spectively of the old company, and he
alleges that on May 1, 1898, Pierce
went to the company's office at night
and coerced them Into delivering to
him over 35,000 of these shares. He
charges that Pierce intimidated the
officers into doing as he wished by
threatening to ruin them financially,
and 'that he made false .promises In
order to get the shares.
Attorney J. C. Bates, whose name is
signed to the complaint, says that
Emery and Doblo were indebted to
Pierce to such an extent that he had
them in his power, and that one even
ing after dark he compelled them to
turn over to him on account of their
debt the stock which they held. It is
contended that as they held it only in
trust they could not transfer to Pierce
tho ownership of the stock. Bates
says that Pierce has manipulated the
stock' since he secured it, and has
formod another company ■to take the
place of the Blue Lakes Water Com
pany. In the complaint it is asserted
tbat tho stock of the original Blue
Lakes Water Company has no market
value at present, but the stock of the
second company is worth $6 per share,
and so Damon's stock is valued at $6000.
After getting the stock Pierce became
the president of the Blue Lakes Water
Company. Emery and Doble have
been ofade defendants in the suit by
Damon.— San Francisco Chronicle.
Suit for Damages.
The damage suit instituted by A. B.
Caminetti against W. Roberts for dam
ages arising out of a collision between
two carts owned by the parties on the
evening of February 28th, was heard
before Justice Goldner on Tuesday.
Caminetti's cart was coming home from
Jackson Gate, and was driven by
young Boro, with Herman Cramer also
on board. Near the California hotel
Roberts' cart was «oen coming from
town and the collision occurred. The
evidence of the prosecution was to the
effect that the Roberts cart was being
driven at a furious pace, tbat be was
slightly to the left of the center of the
road, which is very narrow at that
point, and that Boro on theother hand
was going at an ordinary gait, and
slackening up as soon as he saw the
other vehicle, approaching, and also
turning tp the right side of the road
way as much as possible. Caminetti's
horse ran away after the accident, after
both occupants were dumped out, and
collided with A. Piccardo's cart on
Main street, smashing It up consider
ably. Caminetti sned for $60 dam
ages, while Roberts puts in a cross
complaint demanding $299. The con
tention on the part of defendant was
that the other driver was responsible
for the accident. A number of wit
nesses were, examined on each side. A.
Caminetti was attorney for plaintiff,
and C. H. Crocker for defendant. The
judge has the matter under advise
ment. VQ:-...-
A Gold Find.
Last Saturday about a half mile from
Angels a find of a considerable quan
tity of gold was made by a man named
Clark. He was passing near an old
cabin . when be discovered a piece of
gold. He looked around and found
more, and after digging about half a
day he found he had nearly SI, 700. He
hauled the dirt home in a wheelbarrow,
and from one load he panned out more
than $400. A crowd since then has
been digging up the ground around
searching for more treasure.
The discovery recalls a case of man
slaughter committed about thirty-five
years ago. At that time a man named
Figuero kept a little trading store on
what now is Utica mining property,
but which at that time was a lonely
spot in a heavy wood. Figuero bought
gold dust from the Indians, and always
had a lot of it on hand. One night a
gang of robbers went to his place,
broke in and, taking the old man, who
lived alone, tied him up to make him
tell ' where he had the gold hidden.
They tortured him for a time, and at
last he told them where to find the
gold. They took it and left him. He
was found next morning, but he died
from the effects of the torture. ' A
hunt was made for the old man's
wealth, but none was ever found and
the incident was forgotten. — Calaveras

Missionary Convention.
The Sacramento sub-district mis
sionary convention of the M. E. church
was held in Jackson on Monday and
Tuesday last. At the opening of the
meeting Monday evening the news was
received that Revs. Jaggers of Ply
mouth, A. C. Duncan of Sutter Creek,
Mrs. Jennie C. Winston of Pacific
Grove, and Dr. Smythe of San Fran
cisco, all of whom were on the program,
would be unable 'to ' attend. ' But
enough were present to make the oc
casion one of unusual interest.
The opening missionary sermon
Monday evening by Rev. W. C. How
ard, was a masterly effort, and listened
to with marked attention. Ho took
for, his subject "Handful of corn in the
top of the mountain." A fitting theme
for such an occasion.
The morning and afternoon sessions
of Tuesday were given to the reading
of essays and general discussion of the
same.
Rev. W. Burchett of Amador pre
sented in a logical form the subject,
"The obligation to prosecute home
missionary work." After a discussion
of this by the members of the conven
tion, Rev. W. C. Howard presented a
brief paper on "Systematic and profes
sional giving;" spasmodic giving harms;
systematic giving helps and is healthy;
regular and proportionate giving is the
best, and then we have something in
the treasury all the while, and no one
is overburdened.
Rev. G. W. Beattie presented a
paper on "The obligation to send the
gospel to the heathen," which was
well written and well received. -;.* >~' :;
. Then came Dr.' W. S. Matthews' ad
dress on the relation of the Presiding
Elder to the cauae of missions. He
also gave a short outline of Woman's
home missionary work.
On Tuesday evening the missionary
acdress of Dr. M. C. Harris, superin
tendent of Japanese mission work on
the coast, was one of the most thrilling
accounts of his work in Japan ever pre
sented to an American audience. He
was at his best and fairly captured his
hearers. At the time he entered Japan
he was the only 'missionary who could
speak the Japanese language fluently.
Last Sunday he preached four ser
mons, two in Japanese and two in Kn.
gllsh. .He has an older brother buried

Seduction Works Started Up.
After a period of idleness extending
over five or six years, the Amador Re
duction Works at Sutter Creek, owned
by E. C. Voorheis, have 'resumed
operations. They were started up two
weeks ago. These are the only
works doing custom work in activity
in the county. The Drytown works
have been idle for a long time also.
The Selby Smelting Works reduced
the charges for treating sulphurets to
such a low price that it was deemed
impracticable for local works to com
pete. The charges were cut down to
$10 and $11 per ton, Selby paying the
freight charges from the railroad depot
to the workß. The charges at the
local works were $15 per ton. This
material cut of $4 per ton resulted . in
the suspension of the business in Ama
dor county. It cost tho mine owners
at least $2 per ton to get the sulphurets
to lone. So allowing $1 per ton for
hauling from the mills to the Sutter
works, there remains a margin in favor
of local treatment of fully $4 per ton.
This ought to be sufficient to enable
the county enterprise to successfully
compete with the Selby Company.
The Sutter Creek works are small.
Mr. Voorheis - has secured the sul
phurets from the Keystone and Central
Eureka mines for treatment. This is
about all his works can handle! There
is no doubt the Selby tariff can be met
in Amador county. The mine owners
would naturally favor a home industry
instead of sending their product away,
providing the net results are about the
same. We hope the resumption of the
custom sulphurets business in Amador
county will lead to the retention of the
entire business in this county. To do
this the works would have to be en
larged to | more than double their
capacity. ' The sulphurets from the
Oneida's 60 stamp mill, also from the
Wildman-Mahoney and other mines
are sent .below. If this industry were
kept in the county it would give em
ployment to from 15 to 20 men— an im
portant item in the prosperity of any
town.
Night Was Her Terror.
"I would cough nearly all night
long," writes Mrs. Chas. Applogate,
of Alexandria, Ind., " and could hard
ly get any sleep. I had consumption
so bad that if I walked a block I would
cough frightfully and spit blood, bat,
when all medicines failed, three $1.00
bottles of Dr. Kings New Discovery
wholly cured me and I gained 58
pounds." It's absoluetly guaranteed

Bobbery at Gwin.
During Wednesday night a cabin
near Gwin mine, which . was occupied
by a number of miners, was ransacked
and robbed of valuables to the extent
of between $200 and $300. It seems
that . two of the occupants named
Domonico Biasotti and Paul Benducci
were working on night shift. On re
turning to their abode Thursday morn
ing their appartment was found in con
fusion, and Benducci's trunk was miss
ing. The trunk was afterward found
in the brush some distance from the
cabin. Tweniy-flve dollars in gold and
five checks, amounting to $250 in tho
aggregate, were gone. The parties re- \
ported the matter to constable Kay in
Jackson; this being their former home.
The constable of Mokelumne Hill was
notified, and a man named John
Pendola was arrested at Jackson Gate
on suspicion of being implicated. He
had been staying at the cabin, but took
his things away the day before the
looting. Nothing, however, of an in
criminating nature was found upon
him. Payment of the checks, which
were on the Gwin Mining Company,
has been stopped. Pendola was taken
to Mokelumne Hill by constable Kiser
Thursday, but the justice refused to
hold him under bonds until the prose
cuting witness swore to a complaint.
How they fixed it we have not heard. ■
Bailroad to Gwin.
The Gwin Mining; Company has sur
veyors in the field to determine upon
a route for a railroad from the mine
to Valley Springs, where connection
will be made with the narrow-gauge
line. The object is to cut out the slow
and expensive teaming to and from the
mine. — Stockton Record.

FOOD IN FRUIT SKINS.
ITmtrKlve Qualities In Them Believed
to Be a Brain Food.
There are more nutritive qualities
hidden In the skins of fruits, cereals
and vegetables than the average per
son is aware of. In fact, the great
bulk of the brain building foods are in
the skins of the fruits and vegetables
we eat. j
If, as Savarin says, "the destiny of
nations depends on their food," then
the destiny, whether a healthy long
life or insanity or suicide of every unit
of the United States depends on how he
or she is fed.
If the breed so much depends upon
food, why should not every person ca
pable of normal thought 6eek to pro
cure such food as best sustains 'his or
her normality? Brain : starvation,
through the lack of suitable brain and
nerve nourishment in our daily food,
is the sole cause of the craving for
stimulants to supply, as they do, arti
ficially and improperly what nature
has provided In a natural form in, the
skin of the grape, which contains the
best part of the wine; in the skins of
all fruits and vegetables, and if not in
the skins of the cereals, how comes it
that stimulating properties are extract
ed from them, as the inner kernel,
the starch, is devoid of anything othef
than a heat giver,? i . , ',
It has been proved by chemical anal
ysis and demonstrated by microscopic
experiments that the most valuable
brain sustaining properties are resi
dent in all skins of cereals, fruits and
vegetables, and as an instance of the
great difference to the health resultant
from partaking or rejecting the skins
here is an incident that occurred in
India, as told by an Indian officer:
A regiment was stationed in a part
of the couutry where grapes were the
chief article "of food. The officers, one
after .another, became so sick as to be
invalided as unfit for service, but it
being considered remarkable that the
troops were all well a commission of
inquiry was instituted, when it was
found that while every trooper in eat
ing grapes swallowed the skins the offi
cers followed the fashionable habit of
rejecting them. It was then ordered
that the officers should swallow the
skins, which was dove, with the result
that the} 1 immediately recovered.
Thus It will be seen that the skin of
the grape, besides being a brain feeder,
possesses other healthful and nutritive
qualities necessary to the sustenance of
the human body. The reason why as
paragus, cabbage, string beans, lettuce,
spinach and other green vegetables are
so wholesome is that the skins are not
rejected.— Our Friend.
This would be a much more peaceful
world if lots of grown up people as well
as children could only be seen and not
heard.— Chicago News.
GERMAN ARMY OFFICERS.
The Abject Deference Shown Them
by Civilian! la Amailng.
T!ie respect and deference shown ta
tin' German army officer on duty and
off iluty by his countrymen are won
clcrful to see, according to a London
writer. "Civilians, even compatriots
of distinction, on entering the dining
room bow to him with formal humility.
Ho acknowledges the obeisances only
With a rigid glare of haughty indiffer
ence, though he 1b politely conscious of
the coming and going of ladles. The
German civilian does not appear to be
surprised at or to resent being con
temptuously Ignored by him, but rec
ognizes him and looks up to him as a
superior member of a superior race
and continues to make bis obeisances,
however loftily they are ignored.
"But, while the officer is unable to
boo the civilian at whom he is looking
point blank, he never misses observ
ing the entrance and acknowledging
the salnte of another of his own race.
He rises from his seat and stands stiff
and erect while the newcomer ad
vances and exchanges formal bows
aud greetings, and as he recovers the
erect position from the bow he brings
his heels together with a sharp parade
click and waits until his superior has
taken a seat before he resumes bis
own."
There were tremendous ceremonies
in eating and drinking, too, especially
in drinking. "Each table group lifted
their glasses invariably together, as If
at the word of command, taking their
time apparently from the senior pres
ent. Having seized their glasses.to
gether and raised them together and
simultaneously ' drunk, they would
sumultaneously finish and then, hold-
Ing their glasses before them, would
with great ceremony bow to one
another before replacing tliem on
the table. It •''■lO not matter whether
they were drinking beer or claret or
the German champagne, which seem 9
to be the especially smart thing to
take, there was the same ceremony.
When a senior officer went out of the
room*, all the juniors present rose to
stiff attention and bowed as he passed.
When a Junior rose, he made the round
of the table on his way to the door and
bowed separately, with'a spur jingling
heel click every time -to every other
officer."

Shakespeare* Anachronisms.
The very head and front of all offend
ers In the perpetration of anachronisms
was Shakespeare himself. He speaks
of cannon In the reign of John, whereas
cannon were unknown until a century
and a half later; of printing In the time
of Henry II.; of clocks, and striking
clocks at that, in the time of Julius
Caesar; he makes Hector quote Aris
totle and Corioianus refer to cats and
Alexander; he introduces a billiard ta
ble into Cleopatra's palace; he dowers
Bohemia with a sea coast and makes
Delphos an island.

The "Bis Dipper."
In astronomy the "Big Dipper," so
called, is in the constellation of Ursa
Major, or the Great Bear. The stars
forming the tall of the bear also form
the handle of the dipper. The first star
in the handle is Benetnasch, the second
Mlzar, the third Alloth. The other
four, which go to form the bowl of the
dipper, are Megres, Phad, Herat and
Dudhe. The two last named are called
"The Pointers," because they point or
guide the eye to the pole star, which la
distant 29 degrees. The top bowl stars
are 10 degrees and the bottom ones 8
degrees apart.

THE ALLIGATOR.
Be la Alnar* In Good Hnmor Wnea
Ca+cbing Fllea.
•The alligator Is a funny beast,"
said the old circus man. "The old fel
low we have In the menagerie is a
cross tempered chap. Often at feed
ing time he won't open his mouth, and
we tickle the top of his nose. An alli-
Kator's nose Is very sensitive, and it
always makes him very mad. He
throws back his upper Jaw like a cel
lar door on hinges. Then we throw in
a chunk of beef, five pounds or so, and
repeat the performance until we've fill
ed him up . with about twenty-five
pounds, which it takes to' give him a
square meal. .
"He's never cross when he's fly catch-
Ing. That always puts him in good hu
mor. One would think a fly a small
tidbit for an alligator, but ; they eat
them wholesale. Our old alligator is
an expert fly catcher. He throws back
his upper jaw and goes to sleep appar
ently. The flies light on his under
jaw, and he waits until it is pretty
well covered with flies— until its red
color seems about changed to black.
Then suddenly he slams down his up
per jaw. and he has a fine mouthful
of flies. Alligators would make excel
lent flytraps for houses where there
are no children, except that they are
expensive, as they consume such a vast
"quantity of beef."— Houston Post i
Talking For Buncombe.
The expression was used toward the
close of the famous debate on the Mis
souri compromise In the sixteenth con
gress (1S21). Buncombe, a county in
the western section of North Carolina,
was then part of the congressional dis
trict .represented by Felix Walker, a
resident of Waynesville, In the adja
cent county of Hay wood.
The bouse was Impatient to bring the
long debate to an issue when old man
Walker (he was then sixty-eight years
of age) rose to speak, and be was
greeted with loud clamors for "Ques
tion.". Several members gathered
around him, begging him to desist; oth
ers left the hall, but he kept the floor,
declaring that the people of his district
expected a" speech from him, that he
was bound to talk for Buncombe (or
words to that effect), and he did.
This Felix Walker had! been in his
younger days the friend and compan
ion of Daniel Boone when the latter
explored Kentucky and founded Boons
borough. After representing North
Carolina from 1817 to 1823 be was a
member of the state, legislature and
died in 1830 a short time after remov
ing to Mississippi.
German Birthday Cakes.
The custom of having a birthday
cake is widespread In Germany. I
know it for certain that it is prevalent
In the province of Saxony, In Hanover
and the mark of Brandenburg. As
many lights as the one whose birth
day it Is has years are stuck around the
cake, or the Torte, a thick one In the
middle, called the Lebensllcht the light
of \lto. For persons advanced In years
one candle must do duty, as otherwise
too many, would be required, or a skill
ful lady expresses the exact number
of years In Roman figures (XX, L). .
When Moltke completed his seven
tieth year during : the campaign of
IS7O-71, Crown Prince Frederick Wil
liam, later on Emperor Frederick, pre
sented him with a cake adorned with
seventy lights.
Only he or she who celebrates his or
her birthday may put out the light of
life. It Is unlucky If done by any oth
er member of the family.— Notes and
Queries.
Bared the Lamp.
An amusing scene occurred at a New
York dock the other night. A Scotch
engineer, who wished to go ashore, or
dered a boy to show him the way with
a lantern. As he was crossing the nar
row plank that served as a gangway
the boy slipped and fell Into the water.
The instinct of the true Scot Instant
ly showed itself. "Hold on to the lamp,
boy," the engineer shouted, leaning
over toward the water. "Do you hear?
If it's lost, there's a dollar gone from
your wages."
After some time the boy was rescued
half drowned, but clinging to the lamp.
As some compensation for his trouble
he was forgiven for losing the bottom

Dickens did not begin to save money
until he was nearly forty, and through
out life he suffered acutely and Inces
santly from pecuniary worries and
anxieties. He was never short of ready
money after his great crisis of 1844,
but he was never easy about the future
until after his enormously profitable
second American trip la the winter of
1807-68.
Secrets at Comfort.
Though sometimes small evils, like
Invisible Insects, Inflict pain and a sin
gle hair may stop a vast machine, yet
the chief secret of comfort lies In not
suffering trifles to vex one and In pru
dently cultivating an undergrowth of
small pleasures, since very few great
ones, alas, are let on long leases.

It is inexplicable bow the old delu
sion that a man cannot eat one quail

Any man can eat one quail a day for
thirty days. At Lawrence some years
ago Will Upton ate two quails a day
for more than thirty days. For the
first week or two he starved himself
.with the idea that he must keep up an
appetite. After that he sometimes ate
three or four of the birds In a day.

OLD FAMILIES OF VENICE.
Their Fortunes Are Dissipated and
Their Palaces Sold.
Very few of the fine old palaces of
Venice belong to the descendants of the
families who built and originally occu
pied them. Very little of the enormous
wealth for which Venice was celebrat
ed in the fifteenth century remains.
The most of it has been dissipated by
the descendants of the men who made
It, the same as In England, France and
other countries. The rich men of Ven
ice today are an entirely new class of
people, whose names do not appear In
the Golden Book, which contained a
list of the patrician families in Venice
who were Invited to festivities at the
palace. This book was instituted In
1315 and thenceforth until the Aus
trian occupation was the Index and
Itandard of nobility by which all claims
to precedence were decided.
' Occasionally the grand council, by a
vote, rewarded the gallantry or public
services of some citizen of humble
birth by directing that his name be in
scribed upon its pages. None but those
whose names were in the Golden Book,
could use the golden stairs when they
entered a doge's palace, and when this
right was conferred it was equivalent
to an order of nobility In another conn
try. There is one notable exception to
the decay of the ancient families, and
he Is Count Grimani, who traces his
lineage back to one of the most fa
mous of the doges, whose portrait,
painted by Titian, hangs In the council
chamber of the doge's palace. The
Grimani palace is on the Grand canal,
near the Rialto bridge, and is cele
brated for Its , finely sculptured capi
tate. ■; r, ,
Many of the rich men In Venice to
day are Jews. They practically control
the banking business and manufactur
ing. They own the fine houses of his
torical Interest and the best paying es
tates on the mainland In the neigh
borhood. The present wealth of Venice
is Invested not so much In real estate
as In banking, manufacturing, flour
mills, elevators, gas companies, cotton
mills, the manufacture of glass and In
steamships upon the Adriatic.— Chicago
Herald.
Benevolent.
There was not long since a venerable
and benevolent Judge In Paris who at
the moment of passing sentence on a
prisoner consulted his associates on
each side of him as to the proper pen
city to be Inflicted. "What ought we to
give this rascal, brother?' he said,
bending over to the one upon his right;
"I should say three years." "What la
your opinion, brother?" to the other on
his left "I should give him about four
years." The Judge (with benevolence)—
Prisoner, not desiring to give you a
long and severe term of Imprisonment,
