LITIGATION OVER
ESTATE OF B. ISAACS
Petition to Oust the Administrator
on Account of Mismanagement
The estate of Bernard Isaacs has been
dragging through the courts for the past
fifteen years. Deceased was a promi
nent and weulthv citizen of lone, where
he and his brother Michael Isaacs
carried on n large business in general
merchandising. Some time prior to
November, 1895, he disappeared from
Amador county, and his whereabouts
was unknown. M. Jones was appointed
guuardian of his person and estate.
Thereafter the news came that Bernard
Isaacs died near Sydney, Australia.
The guardianship matter was thereupon
closed, and general letters of adminis
tration were issued to Morris Jones,
June 24, 1!X)[), under which he has since
been administering the estate. The de
cree of court settling the final account
of the guardian says:
1 ' And the court finds that there wns
at the tim 2of the rendition of said ac;
count the sum of $[)75.1)2,m*0ney of said
estate, in the' hands of said guardian,
that all debts, expenses, and charges
against said guardianship are paid, ex
cepting the sum of $3555 which is al
lowed to said guardian, being an allow
ance $45 per month from November 3,
1895, to June 24, 1902; and the further
sum of $900 allowed said guardian
as attorney's fees. The guardian was
directed to apply the sum of $975.92 to
the payment of guardian's compensation
and attorney's fee, amounting in all to
$4555, leaving the estate indebted to
his said guardian in the sum of
$3470.08; and he is to have a lien and
preferred claim upon all the property
now in his hands, to protect said claim.
The account and report states that . the
outstanding indebtedness is as follows:
Balance of M. Isaacs' judgment
amounting to $21,263.01, with accrued in
terest, making a total of $24,&52.88; and
a deficiency judgirent of Morrisßrinn,
amounting to $400. : • . - ■?
The petition for the discharge of the
administrator ' recites: That - this
petitioner is unable to give the value
and character of said property, but avers
that it was of a value exceeding $10,000.
The heirs at law are petitioner; Bertha
Lindner, sister, residing in San Fran
cisco, children of Adeline Isaacs, de
ceased, names and residences unknown;
Benjamin Hammer and Mitchell Ham
mer, nephews of deceased, residing in
Amador county, and other children of
Josephine Hammer, deceased, sister of
Bernard Isaacs; children of Rosalia
Isaacs, deceased, names and residences
unknown; and children of R. Isaacs,
deceased, names an residences un
known. That December 23, 1007, said
Morris Jones filed in this court a pre
tended account of his administration,
but the same is false anJ untrue, and
does not account for all of the property
of said estate received by the said
Alorris Jones as administrator, and un
justly charges said estate with claims
and expenses for which said estate is
not legally liable.
That by the negligence of the said Jones
he has failed to have said account
settled.
The petitioner further avers that said
Jones has grossly mismanaged and
mixed the property of said estate with
his own, and converted part of said
estate to his own use and benefit; that
he has failed to defend suits brought
against him as administrator, thus
causing said estate to lose a large part
of its assets.
Petitioner further avers that the said
Morris Jones is not a fit and proper
person to act as the administrator of
said estate, and should be removed.
That this petitioner is an heir at
law, to wit, a brother of deceased;
also a creditor of said estate in the sum
of $24,(582.88; and that his said claim
for said amount was allowed^ by said
administrator and the judge of this court
and filed herein October 20, 1002, but
noti|ing thereon has been paid.
That the son of this petitioner, Ben.
Isaacs, is a resident of Amador county,
over the age of twenty-one years, and a
ccompetent person to act as administrator
of said estate.
The petition prays for the removal of
said Morris Jones, and that v citation
issue directing him to appear at at time
and pluce named in said order.
The petition was Hied September 18.

Felony Charges Dismissed.
In the' justice court of township one
this week the felony cases against Ohren
Savich of Jackson and Jos Trabucca of
Sutter Creek were dismissed at the re
quest of the district attorney, and a
charge of misdemeanor substituted in
each case. The cases were similar in
character. Savich was arrested for an
assault upon a seven-year old child
named Sophie Cojich in Jackson; and
Trabucca for a like assault upon a minor
child named Louisa Nilo in Sutter
Creek. In each case a charge of asasult
with intent to commit rape was pre
ferred—a state prison offense. On Mon
day these cases were dismisssed, and a
charge of indescent exposure preferred
instead— misdemeanor charges. A plea
of guilty was entered by each defendant
before justice A. Goldner. Trabucco
was fined $300 and TO days in jail with
the option of avoiding imprisonment by
paying at the rtae of $1 for each day.
He paid the full amount, $390. Savich
was fined $300 and 1)0 days in jail, with
out the alternative of release by cash
payment. He paid the $300, and is serv
ing out the rest of the sentence. No
testimony was taken in either case; the
sentences were imposed on their simple
pleas of guitly. There is considerable
talk about these cases.
Evans Applies for Parole
In another column we publish a notice
that William Evuns intends to apply for
release from San Quentin on parole.
Evans was convicted of the murder of
Michael Tovey, Wells Fargo 'B messenger
on the Jackson-lone sta»e line, who was
instantly killed by a shot fired by a hich
wayman in an attempt to hold up the
stage! The murder was committed June
15, 1803. Evani was arrested near Cam
anche on suspicion, and while in jail nt
San Andreas made an alleged confession.
He audscquentlywent back on this con
fession. He pleaded not guilty, but was
convicted, the jury fixing the punishment
at imprisonment for life. Many doubted
his guilt, among them being the detec
tives of the express company. A big
reward was offered for the arrest and
conviction of the murderer, uncl this
played a prominent part in the case.
Married h\ Los Gatos
C" G. Heiser of the Candy factory
left early in the week for the purpose
of attending the wedding of his son
Charles G. Heiser at Los Gatos. The
wedding took place at the residence of
the bride's parents In Los Gatos on
Tuesday evening, September 21, at Bp.
m. In the presence of about 40 persons,
relatives and intimate friends of the
contracting parties, the ceremony being
followed by a reception participated in
by over one hundred persons, who ex
tended congratulations to the happy
couple. The bride is a charming young
lady of Los Gatos— Miss Cecelia M.
Watkins, daughter of Air and Mrs
Frank Watkins of that city. She is a
graduate of the San Jose high school,
also of the San Jose normal school, and
for some time was employed as a
schoolteacher in Alanicda county, where
she-became acquainted with Mr Heiser,
the acquaintance eventuating in matri
mony. The groom is employed' as
manager of the stockbroking firm of
Barth & Co., of San Francisco. The
couple will make their home in Oak
land.
Stung to Death by Yellow Jackets
Ben Fuller of Scottsville lost a cow
and calf in a most singular manner dur
ing the past week. One of the cows
calfcd on Friday in a wooded part of
the ranch.. That night it came home and
was fed, and after a short time turned
loose, and naturally returned to the point
where she had left her offspring. The
following evening the cow returned bel
lowing pitcously, and evidently in great
distress. An investigation led to the
discovery of the calf dead. It had evi
dently been attacked by a swarm of. ye£
low jackets, and literally stung to death.
The carcass was partly devoured by the
pests that were swarming thereabouts.
When the cow appeared on the scene the
venomous insects had attacked her so
fiercely as to drive her in agony home.
She died the next day, it is believed
from the stings inflicted by the yellow
jackets. The cow was valued at $70.
jn many places yellow jackets are rc
psrted to. be. unusually numerous this
season." '
Relocated the Claim
The decision of the superior court of
this county in the suit of F. Garibaldi
and F. Devencenzi against the Grillo
Bros, of Volcano, ■ involving the right
of possession to a valuable placer min
ing claim in Volcano district, which
was published in full in the Ledger last
week, created something of a stir, not
only among the parties directly con
cerned, but also among the many friends
and sympathizers on each side.' The
decision was to 'the effect that neither
party was entitled to relief; that the
title of both was defective. As soon
as the decision was known the Grillo
side took immediate steps to relocate
the mining claim. The effect of the
decision was to throw the land hack to
ths United States, open to location
under the mining laws. In less than
two hours after the knowledge of the
judgment was conveyed to the defend
ants, location notices were posted on
the land, claiming the same for placer
mining purposes by the Grillo brothers.
It is probable that the case will be
appealed to the district court of appeals
by the plaintiffs.
As soon as the condition of affairs
was realized by the other side to the
controversy, they also got a move on,
hurrying supplies and material to the
claim. So the matter stands at present.

MINING NOTES.
Bnnker H i I • . — The ore body recently
cut at the 1750 level is 19 feet wide,
ten feet of which is good milling rock,
and is being crushed. The length of
the ore shoot had not been determined
at last accounts. The walls are smooth
and everything indkates a permanent
ore body. Opening up the ledge on the
1050 level will be prosecuted with all
possible speed. It is almost a certainty
that such a strong ledge will continue
down, and when this is positively as
certained, an addition of 20 [stamps to
the mill— making 40 stamps— v/ill be
proceeded with at once. The first
dividend at the rate of six cents per
share was made on the 15th instant, and
will be continued monthly indefinitely.
This is an increase of one cent per
share per month. The 37th consecutive
monthly dividend was paid this month.
We believe there is not another quartz
mine in operation in the state that can
beat this record. And this result has
been gained without impairment of the
prospect of future dividens— that is
without gouging the mine of its richest
ores.
South Eureka.— The company has
commenced work on an additional
twenty stamps to the mill, which will
make 40 stamps. The mine has been
in addition to its own 20 stamps— using
20 stamps of the Central Eureka mill.
The outlook of the mine, however, in
the judgment of those in charge, justi
fies the expense of proceeding to enlarge
the milling capacity without further
delay.
Bay State.— H. G. Torrance, the
superintendent of this mine, returned
from San Francisco early last week, and
reported that the wages of the employes
and others obligations would be settled.
The mine resumed operations.
Defender— Everything is at a standstill
at this mine, above Pine Grove. The
cyanide plant was closed down over
two weeks ago. There are conflicting
reports as to the cause of the shut down.
One report is to the effect that the fish
commissioners ordered it closed on ac
count of the poisoning of the fish in the
Mokelumne river, into which a portion
of the ccyanide impregnated water finds
its way. It is claimed that many dead
fish have been found in the river. This,
however, has occurred in other seasons
before the cyanide works were erected.
Another and probably the correct reason,
is that the method of treatment was not
effective, and failed to give the results
anticipated. A certain line of treatment
figured out by laboratory experiments
was mapped out, hut on the larger scale
of active working proved unsuitable to
the conditions." It is hoped all ob
jections and shortcomings will be over
come, and that further testing may
prove remunerative.

Mrs M. Seely of Aukum, mother of
V. W. Seely of this place, succumbed
lust Saturday to injuries received a few
><ay.t previous while harnessing a horse.
Just how the accident happened is not
mown, as Mrs Seely was alone at the
fimc, and was never able to give a
satisfactory account of it. The horse
was a pe l animal, one that she was ac
customed to handle, and the supposition
in that it reared, causing Mrs Seely to
fall, and from the severe bruises on her
body, and injuries to the head and
:houlJers, it is feared that the buggy
might have passed over her. Besides
.'lie son in this city she leaves two
others in Amador county to mourn her
loss. Mrs Maria J. Seely was born at
Marion, Grant county, Indiana, and
would have been sixty-nine years of age
the 23d of October. She was a woman
of noble character, ever ready to assist
those less fortunate than herself, and
y-ill be sadly missed by the neighbor
hood in which she had made her home
for so many years. Funeral services
were heid at the home at Mt. Aukum on
Monday, and the interment was at Oleta.

Tlie Lightner mine at Angels was
closed down this week, and a large

operate the skips. It is said that a new

depth of 400 feet to the un worked ore
body. It will take several months to do

made to remove the tracks, etc. , from

How Sargent Came
To His Death.
The Angels Record publishes the fol
lowing particulars of the fatal accident
in the lltica mine last week, by which
Hardy Snrgent of this county, and his
conpanion were killed.
Last Tuesday morning, shortly after
going on shift, Thomas Artery and J.
Hardy Sargent, two young men employ
eb In the Cross shaft of the Utlca
Company, were caved on and killed. It
appears that Artery, Sargent and Andy
Burns were working together, and were
entering a drift on the 700-foot level to
get their tools preparatory to beginning
the day's work. Artery was in the lead,
Sargent next, with Burns closely behind
him. As the men were in the drift
Burns noticed rock crumbling down and
asked his companions to get out of
there, that the ground was unsafe; but
they laughed at Burns' fears, Artery
saying, "oh, its all right, Andy." Just
then a ten-ton slab dropped from over
head crushing Artery beneath the mass
and partially covering Sargent. Burns
had hold of Sargent at the time and tried
to pull him back out of norm's way, but
could not as the rock had already struck
him. Burns received a cut on the hip,
but is otherwise uninjured. As the
mass of rock came down Artery ex
claimed: "oh, Andy!" Those were
his last words. Sargenl said nothing,
but lived about teu minutes after re
ceiving his fatal iniury.
The bodies were hastily removed from
the debris and taken to the surface and
later to the undertaker.
The remains of Artery wera shipped
by train to his old home in Alma., Wis
consin, and R. H. Garrett as escort ap
pointed by Calaveras Union Na 55,
Western Federation of Miners*, accom
panied the remains to their destination.
Sargent and Artery came to- Angels
Camp about seven months agp. anb
entered the employ of the Utica Com
pany. They were faithful men and
well liked by their fellow workmen and
associates. When the accident occurred,
gloom at once prevaded the community
and expressions of sorrow were uttered
throughout this locality. Both, men
came of good families, and the deepest
sympathy goes out from the people of
Angels Camp to the relatives who
mourn the early departure from the
world of two estimable young men.
Thomas Artery was a native of, Alma,
Wisconsin, and was 24 years of age.

Charged With Fraud
Accused of obtaining possession of 160
acres of valuable mining land in Tuol
umne county through fraud, Llewellyn
Pierce of Tuolumne county was given ' b
hearing before United States Commis
sioner Heacock yesterday.
According to State Mineralogist Lewis
E. Aubury, who laid the information
before the Uinted States district at
torney's office, this is but the first of a
number of prosecutions that are to fol
low the alleged wholesale practice of
tiling fraudaulent homestead entries
upon mining lands in El Dorado, Ama
dor, Calaveras, Tuolumne and Mariposa
counties.
Morris brothers and the Boston min
ing company are declared to be rightful
claimants to the property. While Pierce
is alleged to have filed upon it as agri
cultural land. Deputy United States dis
trict attorney Clarke contended that the
whole area is covered with lava and that
a goat couldn't make a living off the
whole 1,000 acres in the region. Taking
of testimony begun yesterday and will
occupy the commissioner's entire at
tention for the next live days, as many
witnesses have been summoned for both
sides. -S. F. Call Sept. 15.

were engaged, and one of their num

displayed bis skill as a champba

mischief bent, changed one of the fif
ty-six pound weights for one made of
cardboard. The strong man's vision

Instant what hnd been don*, he a3
quickly decided to turn It to his own
advantage by throwing thre«. "flip

LOOKOUT STATIONS
IN FOREST RESERVES
A lookout station has teen estab
lished on Shuteye Peak un. the high
Sierras for the purpose of watching for
any fires which might occur in the
mountains. This peak hi* an elevation
of 8,858 and the observer commands a
view of a large portion of Tuolumne,
Madera and Fresno Counties^
A cabin constructed at the top of the
mountain and a telephone line installed,
connects with the forest supervisor's
office in the valley and the various
ranger stations on the Sierra forest. The
observer is equipped with powerful
field glasses and when a fire is dis
covered news is instantly telephoned to
the nearest ranger.
During the short time the station has
been maintained its usefulness has
twice been demonstrated by the dis
covery of tires in remote localities.
These were readily extinguished before
they could gain dangerous headway,
thus saving valuable timber nnd forage
which might otherwise have been de
vustated ha<] not the fires been dis
covered in their Incipiency.
The forest service is planning to es
tablish sevural other similar stations It
the Sierras which will virtually com
mand the entire range of mountains am
in this manner remove the necessity foi
constant patrol on the part of the ranger:
scattered throughout the hills. Mud
of the rangers' time can now be b*
devoted to trail and other improvemen
work without interfering with thel
availability for fighting fires, and th
nervous strain under which many of th
men labored when constantly patrolln
lias been materially reduced.OFFICIAL DIRECTORY

underfill tipple tree, and when IX>acon
Hart came uloug and bejjon to express
his sympntiiy Ueacon Noble decided to
K'llpva his conscience.
But he didn't relieve It. The doctor
came lo the door and beckoned to him
and whispered that he believed the crisis
was passed. It was such good news that
Deacon Noble wouldn't have confessed
anything for a hundred dollars. His
wife convalesced, and time ran along
until (lie biannual camp meeting
opened. Both deacons were particu
larly strong on camp meetings. They
were there and enthusiastic. On the
third day of the camping the spirits of
all were aroused by the words ot a
vlsitlug minister, and at leugth Deacow
Hart got up and said that he could
stand It no longer. He was admon
ished to make a full confession, but
before he could start out Deacon No
ble, who was laboring under nervous
excitement, arose and said that he
had a burden on his conscience that
lie was determined to get rid of.
Something might hare come of the
two ronfcsslons then and there but for
Home loafers who had planned to
bl'enli up the meeting. They let a lot
i«f liees loose on the people and created
a diversion lasting an hour, and when
It was over It was found tlmt both
deacons had been stung so many times
thill uuy matters of conscience bad
been ihlJoui'lkhl to a more propitious
o<'casloii. That occasion came just v
year Inter. There was a Hood In the
I'jvof. njid both deacons turned out to
help the sawmill man save his prop
erty. They were engaged In this
neighborly task when both found
themselves sealed on the same log und
being whlrloo downstream. It was
llieu that Deacon Hart said:
"Abraham, we are In danger."
"We ar<\ Uriah."
"We may never see home again."
"I'm afnild we won't."
"Then I'll make tiiat confession to
you, and you make yours to me."
"Yen: the time has trnrely come."
"Abraham, we traded horses. I

Cyanunidc, discovered by Frank and
Caro in 1335, Is made by heating cal
■ciura carbide in the electric furnace in
a current of nitrogen.. It has been
proved to be a o&eful nitrogenous
manure, which -also) adds lime to the
'soil, and the trails, made since 1901
show that its effect* are about the same
as .tbnse of sulphfite of ammonia plus
the lime. The experimenters have re-
CMnmonded the ttse of about 275 pounds
!jwr acre tfor to 450 pounds for
pdtatoes and beets. Within recent
months 'the manufactures of the new
fertilizer '.has 'been begun in the United
:States, iltaly, Prance, Switzerland, Nor
way and Germany, factories are -about
Jo toe ripened ; i n Hungary and Bavaria,
and others arc being considered in
Canada, Japan, India and South Africa.
The first plant at Niagara Falls has a
capacity of :5000: 5000 tons a year; Hhat in
.Firanae : 'm •■ making 10 tons a day at

The microscope, so long an essential
scientific 'instrument, is rapidly finding
general employment in the industries
and every-day work. It is now used by
the engineer and metallurgist for testing
:metaT6;;tby architects for judgment of the
quality ioT stone; by brewer*, and all
makers fdf beverages, dairy workers,
and -witter-supply authorities; by
.chemists and druggists; by paper manu
facturer^, cement makers, foondrymen,
printers, half tone block makers, tex
tile manufacturers, and mairy others.
One af the most novel of recent appli
cations is found in laundries and dye
works, come of which now test certain
textiles, itlius avoiding possible claims
for damagers, while at the same time
showing the £est means of renovating
material ; , .
A curious? method of sterilizing' the
air of rooms has been adopted by Prof.
Charles Richet of Paris. Glycerine in
smalls drops is scattered along ' a
cylinder containing a suction fan and
the air pumped in is thus charge with
fine glycerine particles, which fall to
the floor, carrying all dust and germs.
Vast quantites of goldbearing sand
are said to exist in Southern California,
New Mexico and Arizona, as well as in
sea-beaches and sea-water, but no
economical method has been yet at
tempted for separating the precious
metal from the great amount of other
material to be handled. The gold par
ticles are too minute to, be collected
by gravity, Amalgamation seems to
fail on account of some oily or other
coating of the particles that prevents the
mercury from having effect, but it has
been recently pointed out that unper the
influence of ar electric current the
nascent mercury released by decompos
ing its salt is more active, while the
current tends to clean the gold. By
using a sluice box with a copper bottom,
adding a solution of chloride of mer
cury as the water carrying gold-bearing
material Hows over, and passing an elec
tric current through the water and the
copper, the latteris made to take up a
thick coating of an amalgam of gold and
mercury. modificaion of this
process, it is suggested, may prove
profitable with low grade ores, and pos.
sibly may solve the problem of extract
ing gold from sea-water.
An attempt to classify human ears by
form and structure has been made at
Manila by R. B. Bean, who finds the
locality especially suitable for such
study, as the mixed population includes
about all races of mankind in varying
degrees of purity. To the various types
of ears he has given such names as
Malay, Negroid, Cro-magnon, Alpine,
etc ; but the ears most common in cer
tain races are found also in men of
similar physical type in other races.
The Alpine ear, for example, is the
ear of a fat man. The European types
of ears in the Philippines are not as
old as those of other than European
origin, and this suggests that the ears
may give interesting lessons in the
evolution of the Filipinos.
For glass that is a good conductor of
electricity— its resistance being only one
thousandth of that of ordinary glass,--
C. S. Phillip fuses a mixture of 32
parts -of sodium silicate, 5 of borax,
0,8, or lead oxide, and 02, of sodium
antimoniate. Acids do not attack this
glass. Tho new material is chiefly
used for the disks of electrometers and
electroscopes, but its filaments may
even be made to serve in electroscopes
in place of gold leaves.
Zinc instead of mortar was used for
joining the stones of two elliptical
arches of 82 feet span, that support a
newly completed armored concrete bridge
near Lyons, France. Previous experi
ment having proven that the molten zinc
—at 800 deg. P.— caused no fractures in
dry stones, the zinc was melted and
poured between the stones, forming
metallic joints an eighth of an inch
thick. The substitution for mortar in
creased the cost about $2.40 for each
square foot of the bridge's horizontal
surface. Tests with cubical stones, Z'A
inches on a side, shewed that zinc joints
do not weaken stones having a strength
of about 14,000 pounds per square inch,,
but are 10 or 15 per cent weaker than
stones having a strength between 14,000
and 18,500 pounds. A less compressible
metal is needed for very hard stones.
Cement joints, when as thin as one
twenty-fifth of an inch or less, stood the
tests equally well, but disintegration
gradually reduces the original strength
of joints of mortar.
To prevent the flabby appearancce and
impaired flavor of fish preserved on ice
has been the subject of many unsuccess
ful experiments. An English experi
menter believes that he has now solved
the problem. The fish are cleaned and
drained immediately after being caught,
then wrapped in specially prepared water
proof paper, and packed in the ice boxes
in the usual way. It is claimed that fish
thus packed can be kept quite fresh
while being transported many hundred
miles, arriving as solid, perfect in ap
pearance and appetizing as when started,
the action of the water from the melting
ice being avoided.
Though the Banquc dv Radium in Paris
is the reputed headquarters for radium.it
is claimed that England has seven times
as large a stock. If the statement is true,
the Parisians have but a single grain of
pure radium salts, while the Radium In
stitute in London has not less than 1%
grams— nearly quarter of a pound— said
to be worth about $600,000. The work at
ttoe institute has given rise to great
hopes for destroying deadly germs and
checking cancer ousgrowtbs.

Subject of Law Suits
T. J. Burrows, <h6 promoter of the re

complaints against business men of this
city, to recover certain sums agreed to
be paid by defendants for a certain num

corporation, which stock plaintiff sold
and offered to deliver to defendant at
defendant's special instance and re
quest; that defendant promised and
agreed to pay plaintiff the said sum of
$503 for said stock on demand ; that plain
tiff demanded payment of defendant of
said $500, but defendant refused to pay
the same or any part thereof, and said
sum of $500 is wholly unpaid from de
fendant to plaintiff.
2d. That within two years last past
plaintiff sold to defendant 500 shares of
the capital stock of the Jackson City
Garage, a corporation ; that defendant
agreed to execute his promisslory note to
plaintiff in the sum of $500 payable on
demand at Jackson, California, without
interest, in payment of said stock; that
plaintiff tendered 500 shares of stock to
defendant and demanded the defendant to
execute said note, but defendant refused
to accept said stock or execute said
note; that defendant agreed to accept
said stock whenever plaintiff delivered
it to him and to execute said note on
demand; that plaintiff offered to deliver
said stock to defendant Jand demanded
the execution of said note, but defendant
refused to execute said note or pay any
thing on account of said stock. .
Wherefore plaintiff prays judgment
against defendant as follows:
Ist. For the sum of $500, with interest
at the legal rate from this date.
■ 2d. That defendant be'required to exe
cute and deliver said note of $500 to
plaintiff.
Plaintiff further prays for costs of suit
and such other and further relief as is
agreeble to equity.

Tonic or Stimuflant ?
There is an immense difference between a tonic and a
stimulant. Up one day, way back the next; that's a
stimulant. Steady progress day by day toward perfect
health; that's a tonic. Ayer's Sarsaparilla is a tonic,
a strong tonic. The only Sarsaparilla entirely free from
alcohol. Do not stimulate unless your doctor says so.
Constipation h the one great cause of sick-hradachc, billoutnert, indigestion, bad
breath, debility, nervousness. Has youf doctor ever rcconr.icndad Ayer's I'illsto you?

Writ of Review.
1 A writ of review has been issued by

decree to annul an order of the superior
court of this county dismissing the ap
peal of A. N. Bcrgavin & Co. from a
judgment obtained in the justice court
of Jackson in favor of W. J. McGee as
plaintiff. The action grew out of v bet
made in San Francisco between the
parties In regard to certain mining slock.
Th; contention of the petitioner 'for a
review is that the supeiior oourt ex
ceeded its authority in refusing the de
fendant the right to lile'a new bond on
appeal in place of the one declared to
be defective. Id support of the action
of the superior court it is claimed that
permission to file a new Jbond was not
asked until after tlie appeal had been
dismissed.

'FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 24, 1000
As the Ledger anticipated, the taxpayers o£ Aniador
county will reap no benefit from the reduced tax rate levied
for state purposes. The reduction in the state tolls has been
more than uullified by the additional demands for the sup
port of the local government over the levy of last year. For
the 'sake oi comparison, we herewith present the tax levies
for the years 1908 and 1909 , so that our readers can clearly
see where the increased demands are made.
1908 1909
State fund - - - 40 36.4
Current Expense 65 (30.6
Hospital fund - - 17 22
itoad fund 33 33
School fund 33 33
Bridge fund ....... 12 15
, High school fund ...... — 01
,
Total $200 $2.01.
From this it will be seen that property holders are called
upon to pay one cent on each one hundred dollars more than
they had to pay iv 1908. notwithstanding the decrease of 3.6
cents in the state rate. This means that 4.6 cents on each
$100 of taxable property is required for the support of local
government over and above the levy . of last year. Taking
the total assessment roll at $5,500,000 in round numbers,
this means a jump in the local expenses of $2800 in one
I year. This is at the rate of $8 |per day. This is something
of a boost in a direction that will be anything but pleasing to
the property holders. Figuring it pro rata according to
population the increase amounts to 20 cents per head for
every maii, woman nna child in Amador county, estimating
the population at 12,000. "" "• * o "''
■=■- The changes in the levy for local funds areas follows.as
compared with last year: Current expense fund is reduced
4.4 cents; the hospital fund is raised 5 cents; bridge fund in
creased 3 cents; and a new levy of one cent is made for the
(support of outside pupils attending the union high school at
lone, in accordance with a law passed by the last legislature,
. which shifts the expense of high school education for pupils
attending such schools from points outside the boundaries of
the high school di.stricfs from the parents to the county
treasury.
This tax was beyond the control of the supervisors to
avoid or abate, and it will continue every year until the law
is changed,or until a county highjschool is established, which
could doubtless be supported for about the same expense as
is now incurred for maintaining the union district high
school.
The most noticeable fact of the above figures is the in
crease of the amount of money required for road purposes.
While the road fund remains the same as last year, 33 cents,
the bridge fnnd — which means legally and practically the
same thing — is increased three cents — from 12 to 15 cents.
These are the funds which are under the exclusive control
of the supervisors in their respective districts. It will be
urged in extenuation of the extra amount demanded this
year for county purposes, that special demands have arisen,
such as hospital repairs, and for bridges. This is really no
excuse whatever, and if the people of Amador county have
to wait until such so-called extra demands cease to exist,
they will look in vain for relief. These are not extra charges
at all; they are merely ordinary expenses in meeting the
regular cost of maintaining the county government. Such
extras will crop up perennially in one shape or another
every year. This year they come as hospital repairs, or ad
ditional bridge repairs; next year they may assume a some
what different face, but the result to taxpayers will be identical
— namely, more money for carrying on the government.
It is about time the people of this county began to take ac
tiou for the establishment of a county high school. As the
law vow stands, all property-holders are taxed for the support
of any high school in the county, both by state and county
authorities. Oue high school is all that this county can rea
sonably be asked to support. It is able to maintain a iirst
county high school — one that would be a source of pride to
every citizen, A move to this end should be made without
delay.

AN IMPRACTICAL JOKER.
Ha Thought It W«» V*ry Funny to
Fire the Hayrick.
Practical Joking, "the. meanest form
of wit," is common In Hungary, for
merly the pranks used to be coarse,
if not dangerous, but that Is changing
now. The only Raving grace of the
Mngyarlnn practical jokes, says \V. It.
F. Movlll In "Hungary and the Hun
garians," is that they are not perpe
trated in a spirit of bitterness.
One of the most fntnous jokers of the
old school was Jozad Gyuil. Exiled
In one of thp. most Inaccessible parts
of the great plaiu, he lived nnd died
"a prodigal and a buffoon."
A story Is told of.Jozsa going to
spend a night with n Count Kegterlch.
Wishing to be Impressive., he Journey
ed thither In a beautiful new touch, of
which he was very proud. On being
shown over the grounds by the count
his attention wan directed to n remitrk
ably line hayrick. Hay wns then
standing at n good price. After sup
per Jojusn drew together some frlendM.
aud the rick was soon nothing but a
heap of ashes.
The next morning when .lozsn want
ed to continue bis Journey hi* won
derful carriage was not to he Heeii
anywhere. '
"Why. tuy friend." said Hie count,
"you yourself burnt It last night, The
fact is my conch house wants repair
ing, and as the evening threatened to
be wet we put your carriage under
tho rk-k to keep It dry."
A MAN OF LUCK.
Th« Story of tho Test by tho Eastern
Kino's Minister.
A king once said to a minister. ••!>«
you believe In luck?"
"I do." said I lie nilnlslrr.
"Can you prove it?" asked Urn king
"Yes. I can,\'
So one nlj;!it he tied tip lo \\w rrll
inp of a room a bag containing peas
mixed wiih diamonds and lot In two
men. one of whom believed in luck
and the other In human effort u lotto
The one who believed In luck ipileil.v
laid himself down on the ground on
his blanket: the other after ji time
found the bag and. feeling In lup dark
the peas and stones, ate the peas nnd
threw Ihe diamonds to his conipujiloii.
saying. "Then? are the stones for yiiur
idleness."
The man below received ttioiu In his
blanket.
In the morning: the k t n <r and ilu>
minister came and told each man lit
keep what he had found. The jtiuii
who believed In trying got the peas
which he had eaten: the other got tln
dia inonds.
The minister then said. "Sire, there
may. you see. be luck, but It Is :is ntre
as peas mixed with diamonds ko Ih
none hope to live by luck."— An fliist
ern Fable.
Teaching Him a Lesson.
The new mall carrier on the rum I
free delivery route slnucpd at the riiinie
on the letter box by the roiidsli!(\
stopped his horse nnd spoke to the
roughly attired farmer with me old
slouch hat who was resting his. sun
browned arms on the gate and look-
Ing at him.
"I see." he said, "your name Is
Holmes."
"Yes."
'■Beverly G.?"
"Yes. I'm the man that lires here.','
"Any relation of Sue.rlock Hoi mm?"
gravely asked the carrier.
"No. sir." answered the fanner, "but
I'm detective enough to know that
you're not n very Rood judge of human
nature. You tool; me for an itfuoiti milt)

Men and Their Feet.
The Frenchman's foot Is long, nar
row and well proportioned-^ The
Scotchman's foot, according to'anthro
pologists. Is high' and thick, strong,
muscular aud capable of hard work.
The Russian's foot possesses one pe
culiarity, the toes being generally
"webbed" to the first joint. The Tar
tar's foot Is short iiud heavy, the foot
of a certain type of savage, and the
toes are the same length. The Span
lard's foot Is generally small, but fine
ly curved. The Englishman's foot is
In most cases short aud rather tleshy
nnd not. as a rule, as strong propor
tionally as It should be.— Argouaut.
Javelle Water.
Wherever water Is used in preparing
bleaches It should be soft. The alkali
in hind water affects all chemical sub
stances. Javelle water Is a standard
preparation for bleaching white things
and removing spots and stains, but it
must not touch colored surfaces. To
make it dissolve half a pound of wash-
Ing soda in a pint of boiling water and
•nix It with a quarter pound of chloride
of lime dissolved in a quart of boiling
water. Btlr well, let settle, pour off
the clear liquid aud keep closely corked
in a dark place.
A Nose For the Truth.
ElttCt truthfulness, according to a
writer In the London Sketch, had its
proper reward in the following in-
Mtuuce;
Teacher— Now, cud you tell me what
the olfactory organ Is? Hoy— Please,,

Climate.— The climate of tho popu
ous portions of tho county Is as genial
and healthful nscan be found anywhero
In California. Ab climate Is one of tho
most valuable assets of this favored
state in attracting population, Amador
stands second to no county In this re
gard. It should, and no doubt will In
time, when its climatic advantages are
more thoroughly understood and ap
preciated, become a hoalth resort not
only for those In loss favored states,
but for the residents of other parts of
California. The temperature alone tho
central portion rarely falls below 30
degrees above zero In winter, and as
rarely rises to 100 degrees In tho sum
mer. Snow seldom falls In the settled
districts, and never remains on tho
ground for more than a few hours. Of
course, in the high mountain regions
of eastern Amador tho snowfall Is very
heavy— which Is characteristic of the
entire Sierra Nevada range. The sum
mer season is alway accompanied with
cool nights; permitting of sound, re
freshing slumber. Fogs aro rare, cy
clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
infrequent.
Gold Mining.— The county, although
rich in other sources or wealth, com
paratively untouched, is noted prin
cipally for her quartz mines. The
deepest gold mines in America are lo
cated here. The Kennedy mine Is now
taking gold in liberal quantities from
quartz extracted from a depth of over
3000 feet below the surface, with every
indication that tho pay-ore extends to
a much greater depth. Since the dis
covery of gold, the county has contrib
uted fully 8100,000000 to the world's
supply of the precious metal. The
mines are still yielding at the rate of
about two million dollars annually.
Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
eight or ten mines operating on what
is called the "mother lode," stretching
clear across the county in a north-east
erly direction a distance of twenty
miles. The mines aggregate between
400 and 500 . stamps, and furnish em
ployment for over 1000 miners. This
industry is still in its infancy. The
unexplored territory, even along the
main gold belt, is far in excess of the
ground that has actually been worked
or prospected. The county offers to
day one of the most inviting fields to
be found anywhere in the world for tho
investment of capital in the fascinating
business of gold mining, not alone along
the mother lode, but also In the almost
untouched . mineralized country ot the
east belt, some tenor twelve miles from
the main lode.
Besides gold, we have copper, de
posits of pottery, coal, imurbe, slate,
limestone, ffranlte, and soapstone or
talc— all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities.— The agri
cultural possibilities equal, if not excel,
the mineral riches. The valley lands
will produce anything that can be
grown in the most favored sections.
In tho foothill lands all kinds of decid
uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of
vegetable aro raised where irrigation
ii- practicable along the numerous water
courses. Further up in the mountains,
at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet, tho
soil is admirably adapted for apples
and potatoes. A ready murket for
many times tho quantity now raised of
those commodities can be found in the t
various mining towns.
Grape culture and winemaking are
becoming importunt industries, both
the grapes and wine commanding a
better price than the product of the
lowland .
Land is cheap compared with other
California lands. Improved farms may
bo secured for one-fourth the price
current in some places. Unimproved
lands can bo had from $5 to $10 per
acre. It does not require a fortune to
buy a small ranch. There is room for
a largo addition to our agnculural pop
ulation. Vast tracts now devoted to
cattlo ranges might be made the homos
of hundreds of prosperous farmers, j
Amudor has a population of less than
12000. Three fourths of this Is concen
trated in a strip of three miles above
and bulow the mineral belt.
Jackson, the county seat, has about
2000 inhabitants, anil Isan Incorporated
city ot the sixth class. Other towns
are' Suttur Creek, Amador City, Dry
towu, Plymouth, Volcano, Pino Grove
and Olota. lone City Is the meiropolls

Electric Power for the East Belt
It is reported that the Pacific Gas &
Electric Company, whose main offices
are now at 445 Sutter St., San Francisco,
is contemplating extending its power
line from the plant at Electra on the
Mokelumne river east to the mines on
the ea9t belt. It is contemplated furnish
ing power to Pine Grove, Pioneer
Creek, Defender, and the general West
Point district, giving power both for
mining and for lighting purposes.
There are many valuable mines in the
big stretch of territory between Pine
Grove and Volcano on the north to West
Point on the south, idle to-day for the
want of cheap effective power that can
be depended upon every day in the year.
It will mean much for the development
of the east end of Amador county.
The guaranty that the power line will
be extended rests with the people. If a
sufficient amount of power is subscribed
for to warrant the outlay, which how
ever will not be heavy as the extension
will be a short one, the line will be
built, and Immediately, so it will be
well for all Interested to do some figur
ing and prepare their estimates.
Crosses Over
The Great Divide.
James B. Bastian died at his home in
Amador City Sept. 13th 1909, after a
long illness of miners consumption.
He was born in England, Feb. 5, 1836.

Benj. Gilbert, miner, of Jackson,
Ca(,, Says: "I used Doan.s Kidney
Pills and they prove of great benefit to
me. I suffered from backache for a
long time and the trouble gradually grew
worse in spite of the different remedies
I tried. I got so bad that 1 could not
do my work and at night was so tired
and played out that 1 was unable to
sleep. A friend finally advised me to
give Doan's Kidney Pills a trial und I
procured a box at the City Pharmacy.
I felt their good effect immediately and
continued taking them until I was
cured. Whenever I feel any symptom of
kidney complaint returning, 1 use

Others give credit to Wnlllnpford. who
lived so Into ax tbe lioglnulii); of the
fourteenth century, lint the most per
fect wntor clocks were, lontf before the
hitter period, furnished with wheels.
shj tbnt the only Improvement was (fio
substitution of a solid body to ant an
a moving welffht Instead of water. It
Is not to be wondered nt thnt the ap
plication of a weight to clocks nn n
moving power should attract so little
attention, as water nnd snnd were un
doubtedly thought more convenient by.
contemporary writers. The oldest com
trfete clock moved by weights Is prob
«Wy thnt netit by the sultan of Turkey
to Frederick 11. In 1202. In the thir
teenth century many of the church
steeples In Italy wore furnished with
clocks moved by weights, which struck
the hours. Hole of Nuremberg Is sup
posed to have constructed the first
watch in ICOO, nnd to him must also
be given the credit of the spring clock.

that the pendulum wtis first applied to

Boar Hunting In Brittany.
Boar hunting in Brittany Is full of
exciting Incidents, and the hoars sel
dom die unavenged, for. though they
are beset by mounted hunters and
peasantry on foot armed with guns,
the llfeblood of many a hound Is
drawn before tho savage old tusker
yields up hia life. Ills dangerous pow
ers of offense ceaso only with his last
gasp. Though the grip of the bulldog,
the yelping of tho hounds, the din of
horns nnd the cries of the- beaters nuvy
force him from hl-i lair to seek refuge
In (light, that withdrawal may be set
down rather to p.-udence nnd disgust
than to any fear. When at last ho
Is brought to bn.v. with his back
ngnlnnt a roc!; or v tree trunk, he Is
ready to defy a host. Met in a narrow
alley of tbe forest, neither man nor
horse can withstand tbe avalanche of
his onset. Not Infrequently the hunter
who loves his bounds will feel but
little triumph even In the dentb of
many boars If. having begun the sea
son with a large pack, he ends It with
a miserable remnant, having left all
his host find bravest dogs on tbe field
of battle.
Two Ways of Telling It.
Once upon a timo a Persian king In
his sleep dreamed th.'it nil of his teeth
foil out before him. one by one. He
summoned a soothsayer and asked him
to interpret the dream.
The soothsayer said. "O king, the
meaning of thy dream is that thy
family and relatives shnll die in thy
presence, one by one till all are gone."
The king was very angry at that
and sent tbe soothsayer at once to
prison.
Then he sent for another soothsayer
and again asked for an interpretation
of the ilream.
Tbe soothsayer made answer. "O
Ulnjr, the interpretation of thy dream
Is that thy family find relatives shall
die. ono by ono. and thon thyself shalt
outlive them nil."
With this answer tho kins showed
approval and commanded that a pres
ent: be given to tho Interpreter and
that he should be sent home with
honor.
Exception to the Rule.
"I have a boy in my school of whom
I am very fond." said n Xew York
teacher smilingly, "but 1 fear to think
wbat his future may be.''
•'Indeed Does he evlnce^-er—crim
inal tendencies?" some grave person
who bad missed the smile inquired.
"Well, I nm afraid he may become a
writer for funny papers." the teacher
suggested tentatively. "You see. I
was having 11 history review one day.
and I nsketl this boy who was Peter
the Great. lie answered. "A czar of

"Anil was there more than one I'etor

THE REAL MYSTERY
OF THE CASE.
GEORGE A. PARKER
(Copyright, 1909. by American 1 Press Aiao
elation.]
Wp detectives have opportunities to
see fnrthef Into human nature than
nny class of men, except physicians,
mid 1 Miv not sure but that our op
portunities nre superior to theirs. One
of the strongest Insights thnt were
ever nceordNl me came through the
Gilbert enso. I was called 0110 day
to thn house of .Joseph Gilbert, whose
son IMjjnr linil been tak*u suddenly
ill nfler smoking n cigar. It was one
of n small package received anony
nioUHly. An analysis showed that the
elenrs linil been steeped In a deadly
poison. ,
Tho young man was unconscious of
having nn enemy. I questioned him
closely, asking him to mention nny
ono who might have tbe- slightest mo
tive to Injure him. I inquired ns to
his relations with the softer sex, and
ho told me that he had! had several
mild nffnlrs of the heart, but none of
them, at least on his part or so far
ns he could judge of the girls' either,
had ever amounted to- anything se
rious.
I left the remaining ei«ars on a tn-
Mc In I lie smoking room, establishing
a watch upon them, thinking that If
the enemy was n member of the house
hold he or she would attempt to re
move them. But after they had been
there a week 1 took them away. I
compared the handwriting on the
package with that of every corre
spondent Edgar Gilbert furnished me.
nnd those he did not bave he procured
on some pretext. I could see no re
semblance In any of them to that of
the address. None of the- expedients I
tried afforded me the slightest clew.
At last I gave up the- case, acknowl
edging myself beaten.
A year later 1 received a note from
Mr. Gilbert. Sr.. Informing me that
his son was about to be married; that
the young man's mother had all sorts
of vague apprehensions that some wo
man had tried to poison him through
jealousy and she desired I would keep
watch over him until the ceremony
had been performed and his safety
seemed to be assured.
I called at the house and was ac
corded an interview with Edgar Gil
bert and his fiancee. Miss Withers,
both happening to be there together.
The moment the girl looked mo In the
eye a suspicion came over me that I
had found the person who had tried
to poison Edgar Gilbert How or why
I divined this I cannot explain, even
to myself. She knew what 1 waa
there for and seemed Interested lv my
protecting her lover. There waa no
betrayal of emotion, no shriuking to
ward me, no disposition to uvoiil my
Saze.
But what a position I was lv— my
client about to marry a girl who 1
felt sure had tried to poison him anil
I not having a shadow of proof by
which to prevent him. The wedding
was to take place lv three days. ;
must make haste
Learning that a sewing woman wa3
employed in the bouse of Miss With
ers, I pa hi her well to secure me a
specimen of the handwriting of every
woman in the house and those who
were the bride's bosom friends. There
were three of the former and two of
the latter. In the handwriting of the
bride expectant's most intimate friend
I fuii ml n chirogrnpny identical with
the address on the package. Making
the lady's acquaintance, 1 satisflwl
myself that she had only addressed
the package as a favor nnd had 110 re
membrance of Laving done so. Krom
her 1 loarned that young Gilbert's
fiancee had at the thno the cigars were

jilted her. causing her great 11 v hap

111.
f learned all I his without giving up

From a statement of tlie state board of equalization of pro
perty valuations in the vaiious counties, which ts published
elsewhere in this issue, we find that Amador county is
gradully being crowded lower in the list, as regards the
value oi its property. There arc only nine counties having
less taxable property than Amador. They are, Alpine, Del
Norte, Xl Dorado, Inyo, Lake, Maripos'aj Mono, Sierra and
Trinity. In recent years Modoc, a strictly grazing county,
has forged away from us; also Plnmas. As boosted by the
state board, Los Angeles now heads the list in taxable
property, being more than fifty million dollars a Head of San
Francisco. This comes as a surprise. It is true, the coun f y
outside of Los Angeles contains perhaps as much property
value as the city itself, while San Francisco represents no
thing outside of that municipality. Still it has been the
popular idea that the city of the Golden Gate was so far in
the lead that ihere war, little probability of its being relegat
ed to second place in the list of counties. The state equal
izers have turned the trick, with a 40 per cent increase for
.Los Augeles, and 10 per cent for San Francisco.
Tho war bel ween Dr Cook and Lieutenant Peary us to
which is entitled to the credit of Jbeing tho first 1o reach

tending parties reach America. Dr Cook has returned
home, and his rival claimant will reach hero in a|few£days,
when the facts, we presume, will be submitted to some
scientific and qualified tribunal for settlement. It is doubt
ful, however, if tlie verdict of si ny court will decide the
controversy conclusively. Dr Cook's side of the case is
strengthened in public opinion by his genial and pleasing
manners, while Peary's harsh words about his rival ex
plorer have prejudiced his case. Peary is less diplomatic
than Cook. The weakness of Cook's story lies in the fact
that he was extremely anxious to be the lirst to announce
his success to the civilized world. And yet ho f tarried in
the, Artie region over a year before making any effort to
■ get back with the news of his discovery.

A Philosopher's Fable
Arthur Anil is responsible for this
>ne:
••Folly. Genius and Common Sense
once went walking and came to n
stream. Genius, having Ills head in
the clouds, naturally started to wade
across, paying no attention to the
depth. The waters soon went over lijn
head, and he was drowned. Common
Sense hunted for a safe way to get
across, and dually he found fl foot lop.
As he got out about the center of the
stream the log swayed, and lie fell Into
the water and sank to rise n<> more.
Folly stopped tit the bank of the
stream to amuse himself by throwing
pelililos Into the water and watching
the waves. lie sat upon the moist,
cold bank until he caught a cold which
developed Into pneumonia, of which
he soon died. Moral.— lt doesn't make
much difference, after all, whether
yon «re n genius, a* sage or a fool.
You'll get It sooner or later anyway."

Take Life Like a Man.
It Is a pitiable thing to see a young
man whining over his lot in life and
excusing indifference and Inaction be
cnuse of hard lncl; or some cruel fate
which has put stumbling blocks in his
way.
No matter what your environment
or what you may be called upon to go
through, face life like a man. without
whining. Turn your face to the sun,
your back to tbe shadows, and look
the world in the face without wincing.
Make the most of your situation. See
the beauties in it and not the ugly
features. This Is the way to Improve
an unfortunate environment.— Success
