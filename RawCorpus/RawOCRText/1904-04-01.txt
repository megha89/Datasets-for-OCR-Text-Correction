MARTHA
M'CULLOCH-WILLIAMS
Copyright. 1903, by T. C. McClure
Cause and effect are your true endless
chain. Thus because young Alanson
brought good letters, the very best, to
the rector and Squire Clark Mrs. Brown
gave the garden party where so much
else happened. Mrs. Brown had three
girls to establish, and, as bcaus were
none too plenty, naturally It was a rul
ing principle with her to let no eligible
young nian get away from Eastbrldge
without a proper experience of their
fascinations.
The fascinations were all very well
until Amy Peters jcania. .^Anijr was «ev-*
er' "accounted a beauty, but somehow
she put all the set beauties out of court
and countenance. Behold her at the
party tripping airily about the lawn,
with young Alanson at one side, Jock
Hllman at the other. and Billy Corliss
tagging after like the faithful watch
dog he was. This while the other
young women had less than a beau
apiece. You will admit it. was aggra
vating. Kate Martin, Amy's best
friend, spelled upon her fingers "P-I-G"
as the train went past her. But Kate
was not in the least angry or jealous.
She had Bobby Shepherd all to her
self, although Essie Brown had done
her best to lure the gentleman away.
"Let me tell you about Miss Amy,"
Jock said to the stranger when pres
ently Amy wns safely enthroned in a
garden chair, with her court still about
her. "She's nearly- the only, girl in
Eastbridge you don't have to court,
whether or no you want to"—
"But you know "you always want to,
Jocky, dear," Amy said saucily. Billy
Corliss laughed with the rest, but
somehow the laugh did not get into his
eyes. Young Alanson kept up the
game bravely. "Can you Imagine a
live man not wanting to?" he asked of
the world in general and Billy in par
ticular. Billy put on his most reflec
tive look. "There might be extenuat
ing circumstances," ho said diplomat
ically. Amy gave him a reproachful
glance and said loftily: "I suppose.
Billy, your extenuating circumstances
wear frocks. Pray, does it happen by
tiny chance that the most extenuating
of them is named Clarissa Brown-?"
"No," Billy said sturdily, shaking his
head. "But that reminds me that neither
Mr. Alanson nor I have more than said
'howdy' to Miss Clarissa. Jock, you
stay here and keep this quicksilver
young person out of mischief while we
scramble through the decent tiling."
"You may liud us engaged unless you
hurry back," Amy llung after them.
Jock laughed aloud. "Let's hide," he
said. "I know the very place. Won't
It give Billy a Jolt to come back and
find us missing?"
"He needs one, good and hard," Amy
said, tossing her head the least bit. "I
have not told anybody else, Jock, but
I'm going to marry Billy if I can ever
make him show himself properly and
humanly foolish. He's so abnormally
steady going and sensible and settled I
should not dare try to live up to him—
Unless I knew he had a nice silly streak
somewhere.". ■
"I suppose you wouldn't any way
consider me. I'm pretty near all silly
streaks," Jock said dolefully. Amy
laughed and patted his arm, saying:
"But you have good sense streaks, too,
Jock, else why should you like me so
well? We'll always lie the best of
friends, I know."
"Bet your bottom dollar on it!" Jock
said, harrying her along. lie was mak
ing for a tumbledown summer house,
thickly overgrown with vines, that
nestled In the very farthest comer of
the lawn. It had a plank floor, rotten
and crumbly, and a dilapidated rustic
bench along one side— a cool, deeply
shaded nook, sweet with roses and hon
eysuckle. Amy sprang Joyously inside
it, with Jock at her heels. As they
made to sit down low, hollow reverbera
tions came up from below their feet.
There was a dull crushing, a giving
away, then before they could cry out a
sliding down, down to dark, dank, un
known perilous depths.
Five minutes later Billy was asking
anxiously of those about the garden
chair, "Where is Amy?" Nobody
could tell him. Presently he spied far
out In the grass one of her little lace
mitts. Running away from it were
faint footmarks on the warm turf.
Billy followed the marks, his face
whitening fast. "Jock could not be so
cruel as to take her near that old well
house," he said to himself— then
groaned aloud; he had come in sight
of the well house, where the crumbled
floor told him the tale.
"Jock! Amy! Answer me! Oh,
God!" he cried aloud, peering over the
crumbling rim into the blackness. No
articulate answer came to him, but
was it fancy that down in the deeps
of earth he heard low, gasping moans?
"He sprang up with a shout that brought
the whole crowd huddling about him.
Mrs. Brown was at the head, weeping
and wringing her hands. "They are
lost, lost!" she moaned. "Nobody ever
came out of that well alive. It's al
ways half full of choke damp! That
Is why my father had it built over!
Why didn't I think to tell everybody?"
Billy seemed not to hear. With giant
strength he wrecked the rotten lattice,
clearing the well mouth, then flung off
coat and shoes, and prepared to clam
ber down. He had already sent for
ropes. "No, I can't wait, with Amy
dying," he said to those who tried to
stop him. "I've got to save her or
die with her. Stand by— listen close—
and let me have ropes the minute you
can."
The last words were shouted up the

well mouth, whence already there
came a faint earthy smell, half sweet
ish, half repulsive. Some of the curi
ous were for crowding the edges to
watch him, but wiser ones held them
back. "Give him all the light anil air
possible, poor fellow; he needs both,"
Squire Clark said- Young . Alanson,
stripped and barefooted, sprang to the
edge of the curb. "Who'll follow me?'^.
he asked. "I'm going down,' right be^
hind Billy; we may make a live chain
before it's too late." ; - ■' .;
"I'll follow! And I! And I!" came
from all about. In a little, the human
line was over the edge, creeping down,
down to the dangerous deeps, noisome
and cold. Billy heard It coming, and
shouted up: . • -o -
"In time, thank God! I hear moapsT'.
Then he gave a great inarticulate jcry.
There, clinging to the rough rock wall,
waS Amy, five feet above the glimmer
ing water, which lapped something
dark and limp. •.. ■."■;' %i -S
"Here, you! | Take hef. upf!.;be critjd,
hoarsely,- husbanding 'his breath all he
might. He had come to the thick, dead
ly damp. Unless he was quick and
bold it would make an end of him, as
It had possibly already made an end
of poor, light hearted Jock. Clinging
fast with one hand, his feet well braced
across the well breadth, he swung Amy
up with the other into young Alan
son's hold. The others knew enough to
pass her on up and out. Drawing a
long, long breath, Billy leaped down
beside the insensible figure at the bofr
torn, caught it up and began a desper
ate ascent.
"Hold hard, Billy! I'm coming to
help!" young Alansou cried, setting his
feet firmly and bending until bis head
was almost level with them. Thus h\
gripped- Jock's collar and somewba*
cased the strain on Billy. Both wertf,
however, so near to smothering their
tense muscles gave down. Lights
swam before their eyes; their heads
were bursting; the subtle heaviness in
chest and nostrils niiinbcd them to the
bone. Alanson felt himself almost fall-
Ing when a rope struck his hand, flung
with such force it almost drew blood.
"Send up, Jock! We'll pull you two
out safe!" the men higher up cried <to
them and then, when they saw their
plight, came down like Trojans to help.
It was little short of a miracle that any
of the three got out alive. But some
how, by the good God's mercy, they
all came into reviving upper air. Jock
had the face of a dead man. .At Bight
of him Amy fell to sobbing. "He— he
lifted me up and bade me cling," she
said brokenly, "but stayed on the bot
tom himself because there was not
room for two to hold in the crevice of
the wall."
"He won't die for it," Dr. Payne
said, looking up from his patient. Billy,
lying spent and white upon the grass,
beckoned Amy imperatively to him.
"You must marry me — right off," he
said, patting her hand. "After this I
dare not trust you with yourself."
"Nor I," Amy said, nestling to him.
"You were horribly foolish to take sueli
risks for me, Billy. It is only by stay
ing with you I can make sure you will
never do it again."
A Lord Chancellor at Play.
It is on record that the great seal of
Britain has twit-;-- been degraded to
kitchen uses. In I,sa4, when Lord
Brougham, then lord chancellor, was
staying as a guest with the Duchess of
Bedford, some ladies of the house party
In a frolic ventured to purloin the great
seal from the chancellor's bedroom.
Trembling with anxiety, the great
man came downstairs to proclaim his
loss, but to his relief they told him of
their joke and challenged" him to find
his treasure. Entering Into the spirit
of their fun, he at last dragged the
emblem of his authority triumphantly
from the coal box.
Still in merry mood, ho led the party
to the kitchen, where each lady made
a pancake, with the great seal for a
pan, pouring the batter between its
disks.
Tills mad prank created so much
amusement that Lord Brougham re
peated it at Taymouth to give pleasure
to the Marchioness of Breadalbane. —

Young Plants
Every farmer knows that
some plants grow better than
others. Soil may be the same
and seed may seem the same
but some plants are weak and
others strong.
And that's the way with
children. They are like young
plants. Same food, same home,
same care but some grow big
ihd strong while others stay
;mall and weak.
Scott's Emulsion offers an
■asy way out of the difficulty.
Jhild weakness often means
starvation, not because of lack
of food, but because the food
loes not feed.
Scott's Emulsion really feeds
md- gives the child/growing
strength.
Whatever the cause of weak-
ness and failure to grow —
Scott's Emulsion seems to find
it and set the matter right.

The Story of Toledo Cathedral.
B The cathedral of Toledo is perhaps
the finest architectural glory that
Spain can boast. The site was occupied
by at least three churches before the
erection of the present building, the
first one, according to popular legend,
i having been erected during the llfe
'.tltue of the Virgin Mary and visited
]by her. Of this church we know noth
ing. The second wns pulled down In
,1032. The third was finished In 1085
and was occupied by the Moors for
many years as a mosque. Afterward
•It was the cathedral of Spain, until In
the early part of the thirteenth century
"'Alfonso IX-. had It pulled down and the
present one erected In its stead. It
Is 404 feet long and 204 feet wide, Is
built from material quarried In the
- neighborhood and Is of the purest
Gothic. It was designed by Pedro Pe
rez Diaz, who supervised Its erec
tion for nearly fifty years and conse
crated his life to it During the five
, eVrituries .after his death more than
'150 architects were employed upon it,
and for 266 years the work was un
interrupted.—St. James Gazette. "
Through Women* Byes.
As a finely dressed woman entered
the "L" train every other woman in
the car eyed her clothes closely.
"There," said a man to his wife, who
was making a close Inventory of the
new arrival's dress, "that Is what I
don't like about women. They display
such interest In other women's clothes.
You see It everywhere— in parlors, at
receptions and balls and in public con
veyances. You never see men acting
that way. lam inclined to believe this
Is owing to men's finer judgment as to
what Is proper. They know that to
take note of another's dress Is the
height of bad manners, and they ab
stain from doing It"
"It is very nice of you, of course, to
praise your own sex so," said his wife,
"but your explanation is utterly wrong.
The reason women notice one another's
clotbjes is that every woman Is prac
tically a 'dressmaker, and when she
sees a dress she views It with the in
terest of a professional."— New York
Press. : '
Confederate Coinage.
It Is a matter of history that the
entire coinage- of the Confederate
states consisted of four half dollar
pieces. The obverse side had a god
dess of liberty (same as United States
coins) In an arc of thirteen stars, hi
her right hand a shield of conventional
design with "Liberty" thereon and be
low the date, 1801. On the reverse
side was an American shield beneath
a Libert}- cap, the union containing
seven -stars— representing the seven se
ceding states— the whole surrounded by
a wreath; at the left cotton in bloom,
at the right sugar cane. The legend
was "Confederate States of America."
In the exergue, "Half Dol." The bor
ders were milled and the edge was ser
rated.—New York Tribune.
Old Time Grave Hobbera.
Under the laws of Draco, the most
severe code ever drawn up, all grave
robbers were put to death without
trial. The old Athenian laws put a
slave to death for disturbing a body
after interment, but in the case of a
freeman a "confiscation of a moiety
of his possessions" was the penalty.
Constantiue decreed that a woman
might obtain a divorce if she could
prove that her husband had disturbed
the remains of the dead. At one time
(In the time of the seventh and eighth
Henrys) the English law held that "it
is deemed unlawful to open a grave
for a second person, except for a hus-.
band or wife." '■;. •":;■'
Vegetable* of Liberia.
The most common vegetables of Li
beria, are the sweet potato, cassada,
yam and tania. The cassada is a root
varying In size from three to eight
inches in length and from three to
eight inches in circumference. When
it is cooked It tastes very much like a
fresh chestnut. This root is the vegeta
ble most extensively cultivated by the
natives and forms, with the rice, their
chief diet. The fecula of the cassada
Is made from tapioca.
Stage Manner*.
Stage managers still consider it nec
essary to keep the actors bustling about
the stage_ in a meaningless, unnatural
and distracting manner. In life I do
not speak throe or four sentences to my
friend at one side of the room mid then
with him elaborately cross the room be
fore I continue my discourse. Why
should I do so on the stage? — London
Academy.
Slan the Slave.
It has taken ages of repression to
bring the husband and father to his
present condition of abject slavery to

that awaits the bumble on the other

PARAMOUNT is one of the handsomest
horses in the state and his breeding is of
the very best. Those who raise colts by this
beautiful young horse can consider themselves
fortunate. A tougher, more hardy, or better
formed horse never lived. His sire "Old Alta-
mont" was the greatest sire of extreme speed
in his day, having seven in the 2:10 list. There
are but two or three of his sons in the State,
and Paramount outclasses ' them all in beauty
and breeding. Paramount's dam, Nancy, by
Engineer, son of the Great Electioneer, was a
beautiful mare with extreme speed but never
was raced,

Countries a* Preaenta.
Cleopatra received Egypt as a pres
ent from Julius Cocsar. Lucullus, Sul
la and Pompey each gave away half
a dozen kingdoms. Antony gave the
little kingdom of Judaea to Herod. One
of the excellent stories of the past is
that the Emperor Constantino gave
Rome and all Italy to Pope Sylvester,
who cured him of leprosy. King John,
called Lackland, being excommunicat
ed by Pope Innocent 111., gave to that
pope and his successors the kingdom of
Ireland and England. Tbe deed reads,
"Not constrained with fear, but with
my full consent and the advice of my
barons, for tbe remission of my sins
against God and the church, I resign
England and Ireland to God, St Peter,
St. Paul and our lord the Pope Inno
cent, and to his successors in the apos
tolic chair." Julius 11. gave the estates
of King Louis XII. to the Emperor
Maximilian. Sixtus V., Gregory XIV.
and Clement VIII. were ready to make
a present of France to whomsoever
Philip 11. would have chosen for tbe
husband of - his daughter Clara Eu
genia. Alexander VI. presented the
East and West Indies to Spain and
Portugal, which was like giving al
most all the earth.
The Birch.
Old writers In mentioning birch trees
beldom failed to say solemnly that they
were useful to grow branches with
which to give boys thrashings. Turner
regards the supply of "flexible, pendent
branches" for purposes of punishment
aa the chief merit of the tree. Coles
also based his estimate of the birch
chiefly on its use In the supply of rods
as instruments of punishment, for be
writes: "The civil uses whereunto the
birch serveth are many, as for the pun
ishment of children, both at home and
at school; for It hath an admirable In
fluence upon them to quiet them when
they are out of order, and therefore
some call It makepeace." In ancient
Rome the fasces of the lictors, with
which they cleared the way for magis
trates, were formed with rods of birch,
and their Influence was sufficient to In
sure a rapid dispersion of men assem
bled where they would Impede the
passage of the administrators of the
law. From that time to within a com
paratively recent period the birchen
rod was regarded as one of the most
important deterrents of Juvenile j de-.
pravity.
A Japanese Mimic.
A jolly little story Is told by a con
tributor to an English paper about a
curious faculty the Japanese have of
Imitating animals. "I remember some
years ago," she says, "being at a Christ
mas juvenile party when a nephew of
the mikado was present The young
prince got himself up by means of a
muff, a sable mantle and a boa for a
tall to .look like some extraordinary
feline and then' crawled Into the room
where the Fells dotnestlca was enjoying
the hearth rug before the fire. There
was something so sinuous and lifelike
In his movements that tbe wretched
grimalkin almost flew up the chimney
with terror."
Tbe Retort Disdainful.
Ellen Terry, the famous English ac
tress, In the kindness of her heart once
took a girl out of the poorhouse to train
as a servant But she was altogether
hopeless and was continually breaking
plates, dishes and everything she laid
hands on, until Miss Terry thought that
in time she might break her, so she dis
missed her. But, not wishing the girl
to come to any harm, when she was go
ing away she asked her what she was
going to do for a living. "Oh," she
sold disdainfully, "if the wust come to
the wust, I can go on the stage."

Stammering depends on a want of
harmony between the action ot the

which modulate the sound to the form
of speech. Over either of the groups

a frequent cause of stammering. It Is
possible that the defect In. strap In
stances may result from malformation
of the parts about the back of the
mouth. The fact that stammering
people are able to sing their words
better than to speak them has been
usually explained on the supposition
that In singing the glottis is kept open

ij A COSTLY EXPERIENCE.
: Colorado presents a striking ex
ample of the disastrous effect of
labor troubles. During the past year
that state has suffered to the extent
of !$50,000,000. This includes the
loss of wages, the decreased produc
tion of the mines, the cost to the
state to maintain order in the dis
turbed districts, the sums paid out
by ,|he labor unions to maintain the
striking miners, and the loss to the
business community generally in
consequence of the decline of pro
duction and the shrinkage of wage
earnings. This is at the rate of ten
dollars per capita of the entire pop
ulation of the state. The gold pro
duction has fallen off six million dol
lars] owing to this cause.- Colorado
is far in the lead as the most liberal
producer of the precious metals. Her
mineral wealth is inexhaustible, and
there can be no question that her
output of wealth the past year would
have far exceeded any previous . rec
ordfhad it not been for the unfor
tunate industrial warfare which has
• - •* • ' • ■
so cruelly crippled her for the time
being. The state is still in the
throes of labor war. It is the storm
center of strikes and lockouts. Con
sidering the population, probably no
state in the union has ever suffered
so severely as she has done in so
short a time from the same cause.
We»at this distance from the theatre
of sfrifecan form little idea of the
havpp and destitution wrought. The
contending forces seem to have set
tled ■ upon Colorado as the battle
ground where the issues involved
are io be fought to a finish. When
state troops are reinforced by
United States soldiers, and martial
law*'is proclaimed, the situation
must be desperate indeed. No doubt
things have been done by the authori
ties .which smack of military des
potism, a denial of individual liberty
whictfis the proud boast of every
American citizen.. The round-up of
laborigitators, and deporting them
to distant points, with a significant
warning not to return, is uu-Ameri
can ijris true. It cannot be justified,
except on the plea of dire necessity
in extreme circumstances.
THE LICENSE QUESTION.
The;; saloon men throughout the
county have taken no steps, so far
as we have been able to learn, to
comply with the terms of the license
ordinance passed by the supervisors
some two months ago. After weigh
ing the matter thoroughly, the gen
eral impression prevails that the
ordinance is unworkable; its terms
are not adapted to a county like
Amador; that some of its provisions
cannot be enforced, and as a whole
it is very doubtful whether the law
would "stand the test of an appeal
to the; courts. It is currently re
ported that the ordinance will either
be remodelled, or a new ordinance
passed along different lines by the
board of supervisors at their .next
meeting.
The Calaveras Prospect says re
garding the republican nomination
for Assemblyman of this district:
"Amador is talking of two men, C.
H. McKenney, the present incum
bent, and H. W. Wood of the Ama
dor Record." We in Amador coun
ty were not aware that much "talk
ing" was going on. Certainly this
statement of bur cotemporary is the
first blast we have heard on this
subject. The Ledger indulges the
hope that the republicans will put
up a man for the legislature who will
pay more regard to the introduction,
of remedial 'measures — measures
tending to relieve rather than in
crease the burdens of : taxpayers.
The idea that the usefulness of a
statesman is gauged by the amount
of money he gets from the public
treasury to be expended in the terri
tory which he represents, is losing
popularity. It has been shamelessly
abused. What we want now, more
than at any time in our past history,
is a broad-minded representative
who will vigorously apply the brakes
to the ruinous "get-all-you-can"
policy. The good fellow well met
is all right in his place, but just now
we need a man of nerve to oppose
the many schemes floated from
motives of self interest, rather than
public good.
The methods of the Hearst boom
ers are illustrated by the following
communication, which is being sent
to country publishers throughout
the United States. Papers of every
political shade are invited to join the
Hearst procession by the free plate
service route. The Ledger is in re
ceipt of one of these gilded baits.
We have been in the newpaper
business for thirty years, but never
before ran up. against such a brazen
effort in behalf of a' self-constituted
candidate to capture the presidency
by the influence of coin.' If Hearst
succeeds in annexing the democratic
party to his' financial bureau — and
the outlook in that direction is by no
means discouraging to his managers
— he will no doubt continue the
same "yellow" methods throughout
the campaign. The missive we re
fer to reads as follows:.
To the Publisher: .
We send you herewith a proof sheet
of a '-Democratic Ante-Con ventien
Page," which we are authorized by the

charge, transportation prepaid, if you

Sknll Fractured.
A serious accident happened- at the
granite quarry, six miles north east of
Jackson, yesterday afternoon. The
men were employed in getting out a
granite slab weighing about a ton.
They were using a windlass for hoist
ing purposes. An Italian workman
named Donko Franatovich was at the
windlass at the time this weight was
suspended. In gome way which we
cannot explain, the windlass got away
from him, and in the effort to recover
control, or get out of the way, the
handle struck him in the head.' The
blow, fractured the fore part of . the
skull; also crushed the bone over the
left eye, and injured the left eye so
badly that it is feared he will lose the
sight. Dr. Endicott went up last night
to attend to the case, j The victim is
very dangerously hurt, and what the
outcome will be cannot be told at pres
ent. The victim is 56 years of age,
and a brother of A. Franatovich, the
proprietor of the marble works in
Jackson.

Jackson, March 30.
Editor Amador Ledger:—
Be kind enough to allow a small
space in your valuable paper to express
my opinion regarding Amador county
affairs. , The reason I say valuable
paper is this: I consider the Ledger Is
the only paper that ever prints or pub
lishes one word in the interest of. the
taxpayers. Unless there is more
economy practiced by our county of
ficials in the near future, our property
will have to be assessed still higher, or
the tax rate raised another notch above
what it is at present, and the Lord only
knows that our taxes are too high
already. In looking over the bills al
lowed by our buard of supervisors -at
their last regular meeting, I thought it
was a shame that the taxpayers should
be called upon to pay some of them.
The expenses for the month of Feb
ruary, outside of schools, and most of
the rounty officers' salaries, was close
on to $5000. We paid $25.70 for tele
phoning, which I don't think that we
ought to pay for. In fact, one instru
ment in each building ought to be quite
sufficient to do all the county business
that is done in our court house, and I
don't think that we ought to be called
on to pay any more. The idea of every
county official having a telephone is an
outrage on the people and ought to be
discontinued. We used to get along
with county affairs before we had any
telephones, and our officers get more
salary now than they did then. We
also paid a bill for traveling expenses
of $93— quite a big item. We have
plenty of legal business to attend to
right at home if our officers would
carry out the recommendations of the
grand jury and stop all gambling and
illegal games and devices.

For many years it has been supposed that

opposite. Indigestion causes oatarrh. Re-
peated attacks of Indigestion Inflames the
mucous membranes lining the stomach and
exposes the nerves of the stomach, thus caus-
ing the glands to secrete mucln instead of
the Juices of natural digestion. This is
called Catarrh of the Stomach.

GKAVEYARD DESECRATION.
How Jackson's City of the Dead is
Treated.
In all ages and among all nations the
burial places of the dead are held in re
spect bordering upon awe. The tombs
of the ancients are the only , structures
that have survived the ravages of time.
The pyramids of Egypt and the mounds
where the ancient cities of Ninevah
and Babylon slept undisturbed for
centuries, testify to the feeling of awe
which possessed the ancients against
disturbing the silent abodes of the de
parted. No matter how low down in
the scale of humanity a people may be,
this respect for burial places exists to a
greater or less degree. The savage
and the Christian alike partake of this
spirit of veneration. In civilized lands,
the character of the people is gauged
in a great measure by the regard mani
fested to the spots where human re
mains are allowed to dissolve again to
dust. Jackson is not deficient in this
spirit of respect. It would be a calumny
upon her citizens to say that any mani
festation of unconcern is shared in by
the people. They are as sensitive on
this tender subject as any people, and
whatever reflection the facts stated in
this article may carry, we wish it to be
understood that the heart of the citi
zens generally pulsates in the right
direction.
The public cemetery of Jackson has
been left to take care of itself. It has
been in charge of everybody in general
and nobody in particular. Although
the supervisors are the legally consti
tuted guardians of public graveyards
under such circumstances, heretofore
they have exercised no supervision
over the burying ground of the county
seat. With no one clothed with
authority to look after it, it has been
neglected to some extent, but not dis
respected.
Last Saturday a cry of indignation
was raised by a report that several
men were engaged in cutting down the
natural shade trees within the in
closure. The object of the cutting was
to secure firewood. It was not to
beautify the grounds. The expressions
of disapproval of these acts of spoilia
tion were loud and persistent. An in
quiry was made as to who authorized
this work, but no satisfactory answer
could bo had. Supervisor Newman,
when asked about it, said that he had
not sanctioned it; and no one else could
give even the color of authority for
such acts. Owners of plots have no
right to do this. Fancy any person
walking into the Catholic graveyard
here, and cutting down trees right and
left, and justifying himself by saying
that the relatives of deceased persons
buried near-by had given consent.
Would the church authorities accept
such a shallow pretense? Would not
the trespassers be turned over to
minions of the law? Can it bo sup
posed that a graveyard in charge of
public officials is not protected by law
to a like extent?
Sunday morning we visited the ceme
tery to see what had .been done. The
eastern portion, comprising fully one
half the total area, and tenanted mostly
by the indigent dead from the hospital,
was shorn of every vestige of 6hade.
We counted eight stumps of oak trees
recently felled in this section, the
stumps standing about a foot above the
ground. No attempt had been made
to grub them up by the roots. The
purpose was plainly to get the wood,
and nothing else. Nearly all tho wood
had been removed, a few sticks only
remaining. A lot of brush and debris
was piled up preparatory to burning.
Blackened spots indicated where other
refuse, heaps had been burned. The
amount of stove wood secured in this
section is estimated at from six to eight
cords. A few rough head boards usu
ally placed over these graves were in
tact, but the majority were unmarked
and fragments of broken headboards
were strewed over the ground. It is a
wilderness of mounds — treeless, path
less, and neglected. -
In the front or western half, de
voted to family plats and general burial
there are a few native oaks left, afford
ing some protection against summer
heat. But here, too, the work of the
despoilers was in evidence. A few feet
inside the front fence two oaks had
been cut, the freshly chopped stumps
showing just above the ground. Three
tombstones nearby bore evidences of
disturbance. Two of these — one in
memory of Mrs Reed the other of Ar
thur Sneer, both erected in early days,
had' apparently just been reset. The
fresh cement that held- them to the
pedestal wUs all exposed, and sticks
were placed to hold them in positon
until the cement had time to set. It
was plain that they had been disturbed,
whether knock-ed down by fallen trees
or taken down temporarily to avoid
damage we do not know. Pieces of
decayed fencing, disturbed .by the
wood choppers were thrown in confu
sion, over partly inclosed plots. One
man, a part of the time we were there,
was at work, engaged we believe in re
setting the displaced monuments here
in referred to. Just outside the front
fence other trees had been cut down,
a big pile of brush and a quantity of
wood still lay in the public roadway —
the tangible reward and the incentive
of the trespassers. We might cite nu
merous other facts, but these will be
sutliciont.

of ladies appeared before the local jus
tice to swear out warrants fur the ar
rest of four persons alleged to be guilty
of these doings. The following section
of the penal code was cited as the basis
of the complaint:
2%. Every person who willfully
and maliciously defaces, breaks, de
stroys, or removes any tomb, monu
ment, or gravestone, erected- to any
deceased person, or any memento or
memorial, or any ornamental -plant,
tree or shrub, appertaining to the
place of burial of a , human being, or
who shall mark, deface, injure, destroy,
or remove any fencei post, rail, or wall
of any cemetery or graveyard, is guilty
of a misdemeanor. ; -
This is plain enough, and who will
assert that the facts as stated above do
not come within the range of this legal
enactment. There was some backing
and filling, and consultation in official
circles. The ladies would not be side
tracked from their purpose, and in
sisted that warrants be issued; they
were eye-witnesses of the spoilers'
work, Finally.pushedto the deciding
point, the justice, doubtless acting on
advice, flatly refused to issue warrants.
It is mooted around that a few more
trees will probably bo cut down, and
then peace will bo proclaimed ; that is
understood to mean that when the pub
lic graveyard is shorn of every ■ vestige
of natural shade, the vandalism will
cease. Recently Amadorcounty's legal
department distinguished itself by try
ing to punish an editor for acknow
ledging receipt of a feed of deer meat

The issue was deemed by the same 4
worthy tribunal of sufficient importuned
to be submitted to a jury. But when

10 Reasons Why Chirm's Concert Hall Ought
to Ban and be Supported. »
Ist. It is an orderly, house. There
has never been an arrest or a fight in
the house since the show started. ' :,'
2nd. It is a clean entertainment, and
has brought good singers and artists
to Jackson for the amusement of the
single and floating population.
:3rd. It pays out over $150.00 per
week in salaries and percentage. .. A
large portion of this money is spent
right here in Jackson. '"•■'.
" 4th. It is a benefit to Jackson inas
much as it draws an outside element to
town that otherwise would probably
spend their money in Sacramento, San
Francisco, or Stockton, where they
run without trouble. -
sth. Because a town of the popula
tion of Jackson ought to have a central
place of amusement during the winter
months to accommodate the single
men, who have absolutely nowhere 'to
go outside of a saloon, or. worse,. Jack
son not even boasting of a public read
ing room with all Its churches. !' :
6th. The show is- absolutely free,
and many men come nightly who never
purchase refreshments.' No man .is
either asked or compelled to spend one
cent.
7th. No performer or employe .of
the Xchange— male or female — has ever
been publicly intoxicated, or caused
any trouble to the officers. If they
did, they would be instantly discharged,
Bth. The Xchange has done more
advertising for Jackson through the
distribution of programs, in letters and
separately by mail,' than Jackson has
ever done for itself.
9th. The expenses of running the
Xchange and In building up a trade, so
far has cost all the profits, and the
only money made by the venture is in
the future. < • -•.-.• v
10th. • Let some of the taxpayers who
are taxed more than John Chirm make
the complaints and sign them, and not
have the complaints made subrosa,
then perhaps the inhabitants of Jack
son will find the true inwardness of the
attitude of the county and the town of
Jackson to the Xchange Music Hall.

THE PRESTON SCHOOL FIRE
Official Report of the Trustees Thereon.
How Fire Started Unknown.
The trustees of the Preston School
met in lone last week, and after a full in
vestigation issued the following report:
To His Excellency, George C. Pardee,
Governor of the State of California.
We ; have investigated the circum
stances of the fire which occurred at .
the Preston School of Industry on the
night of March 22, 1904, and accom
panying this report is a transcript of j
the testimony taken. '-;:. -.'■.
Upon our investigations we have
based the following conclusions:
The beginning of the fire was in the
attic of the Trades building, and it was
discovered by the outside night watch- i
man at about 8:45 p. m. There was
stored in this part of the Trades build
ing a lot of material more or less in- 1
flammable, consisting of pine lumber,
old furniture, some cocoa matting, et
cetera. Two of the windows of the at
tic were opened toward a smoke stack,
outside the building and four or five
feet from the wall, the top of which
was some ten or fifteen feet above these ■
open windows. The windows were .
open to admit the guy ropes of the
smoke stack, and this arrangement
had been in force since the boiler for -
the laundry had been set, about, four ' -
years ago.
We find that the electric wires which
entered the attic were dead wires, not-;
being in use. Therefore it would not
have been possible for the fire to origi- -
nate from the electric wires in the attic, v 1v 1
Should a fire have originated from the ■
electric wires in any part of the build
ing where such wires were In use,' the "
fuses would have blown out in that part "
of the building and the lights have been
extinguished. As the evidence shows
that the lights were burning after the
fire had started, no short circuit could
have occurred. '• '.» ~
We can only conclude that " the fire
originated by spontaneous combustion, "
or that a spark blown from the smoke
stack into the open window of the at
tic, or through the ventilators in the .
roof, ignited the combustible material "
stored there.
Knowing that the ordinary mind is < .'
likely at once to jump to the "conclusion
that -the fire was incendiary, we in
vestigated this phase of the matter
most thoroughly. The evidence shows ;
that the attic, where we suppose the -
fire, originated, was kept securely lock
ed, and the key held in .the possession i
of but one officer, the carpenter; The ■"
last time the attic had been visited by •
any one was some six weeks ago, when' ■
the blacksmith had occasion to go there
after a piece of furniture. And from
that day until the time of the fire no
person, to our knowledge, had entered
the attic.
Within a few minutes of the time it
started, the fire was discovered by the ■
night watchman, who promptly gave
the alarm. The superintendent was",
the first to arrive at the building after
the alarm had been given. He was
followed immediately by all the officers
not on duty with the boys, who were
all in bed asleep and knew nothing of
the fire. Many of the citizens of the
town came quickly to the help of the
school, and with the officers rendered
such efficient service that a portion of
the laundry machinery was saved by
checking the fire in that part of the
building.
The walls of the building remain in
tact, and, so far as we can tell from our
investigation, are not damaged to - any ■'
extent. The entire inside of the build
ing from the foundation to the roof,
with the exception above mentioned,
was completely consumed, together -
with its contents, comprising the stock
and equipment of the carpenter shop, I -
laundry," photographer's, printing '
shop, shoe shop and tailor shop. We -
estimate the total loss to the state at
from $12,000 to $15,000.

BURGLARY AND ROBBERY.
A Suing Attempt to Bob the Last
Chance Saloon.
One of the most daring burglaries we
have been called upon to chronicle was
committed at the Last Chance saloon
during Monday night. This saloon is
situated at the north end of Main
street, Jackson, opposite the bridge
over tho north fork. The proprietors
are Airolde& Ouliali. It does a large
business, tbe patrons being mostly
Italians: A small fire proof safe' ls in
tbe front part of the barroom behind
tbe bar, tbe front "of the safe facing
east, leaving a narrow passage way for
the bar-tender not more than three
feet wide. It was tho contents of this
safe that furnished the incentive to the
crime. In timed past tbe proprietors
have kept considerable money in the
safe, but latterly it has been the cus
tom to deposit in the bank when the
cash amounted to between $100 and
$200. Monday night the saloon was
closed about 11:30 o'clock. No one
sleeps on the premises. So that from
that hour till about 6 o'clock Tuesday
morning the burglars had a clear field
for their . operations. Everything
points to the fact that the safe-crackers
wero thoroughly conversant with the
premises, and also that they were green
hands at that business. It is thought
that at least two and probably three
-persons are implicated in the crime.
They appeared ou the sceue fully armed
with all the implements of warfare, .as
they thought. Their weapons con
sisted of a 16 Ib. sledge hammer and
a brace-and-bit. Both implements
were left in tbe saloon. The sledge
hammer has been identified as one used
at the blacksmith shop at the Ken
nedy mine, while the brace-and-bit was
taken from the north shaft of the same
mine.
Entrance to the saloon was effected
through the side or north door of the
barroom, which opens upon the bowling
alloy. Here they could operate with
out being seen from the street. With
the brace-and-bit four holes were bored
through the door.'just above the lock.
A blow easily knocked out a piece of
tbe door, sufficiently large to enable
the hand to be introduced, and there
by undo the side catch on tbe lock by
which the door was fastened. The door
of the safe was next tackled - with the
sledge hammer. The hinges were
knocked off, the combination entirely
destroyed. All this was evidently done
under the impression that the door
would fall open if the hinges were re
moved. Finding that it was still firm
in its place, the robbers secured other
tools. Breaking open a door leading
to rooms in the rear of the barroom
they got a hatchet and an ax, and with
these again assaulted the safe. Using
tbe hatchot as a wedge they ripped
open the front of the safe for four or
five inches from the top." Digging
through the cement casing they en
countered the inner steel, and with this
obstacle confronting them they must
have voted their adventure a failure.
All the implements were left on the
promises. A dozen fragments of the
broken safe testify to tbe determined
character of the attack.
Tho men worked by the light of a
candle, spots of grease are scattered on
the top of the safe, and a small piece of
candle, not more than an inch long,
was left as a memento. Tho contents
of the till were taken, amounting to
not more than two or thren dollars.
The proprietors, on opening up Tues
day morning, were astonished to see
the way things had been wrecked. The
officers wero notified, aud Sheriff Nor
man and deputies wont promptly to
work to ferret out the perpetrators.
A Dollar*

To our estimation there is not a

struggle, yet how easy it is to
make it. When you intend to
make a five dollar purchase come
to us, you will get it for $4, and
so get a dollar for nothing.

ground, and rendering her unconscious

ceeded in restoring her to conscious

Rumor has it hereabout that ex

gladly welcome his return to the board.
We heartily second the suggestion
made by Commissioner Filcher that
the county purchase the gold nugget
recently found at this place, and put it
on display at the St. Louis Exposition.
It would not be a losing proposition
for the specimen is worth the money,
and some curio collector might be will

DEATH OF JOHN FOSTER.
John Foster, an old and respected
citizen of Amador county, suddenly
and unexpectedly departed this life last
Saturday morning. Mr. Foster was at
one time an inmate of the county hos
pital, but for the past three years has
been living in the old Canepa cabin, on
a mining claim near the Mokelumne
river, owned by John Grillo of Vol
cano. One day last week Messrs. Mc-
Lain and Shepard discovered that the
old gentleman was in a helpless condi
tion, not being able to supply himself
with the necessaries of life. They at
once provided him with proper food
and clothing, and notified Supervisor
Grillo that he wished to be taken to
the hospital. Early Saturday morning
Grillo sent his brother James with a
carriage to take the old gent to Jack
son. The carriage could only be taken
to within 300 yards of the cabin, and it
was necessary for Foster to either walk
or bo carried that distance. After eat
ing a hearty breakfast, and being sup
ported on either side by. his friends,
McLain and Shepard, he walked to the
carriage, seemingly without any great
effort. Here he was given a light
stimulant, and being comfortably seat
ed in the carriage he bade his friends
good-bye and started for the hospital.
All went well until they had driven
about three miles, when Grillo noticed
that his companion had ceased talking
and seemed uncomfortable. When
asked how be felt be replied, "Not
very well." Grillo then said, "'Do you
know me," and Foster replied, "Yes,
you are Jim Grillo." By this time
James noticed the 'death stare in his
eyes, and held him upright in the car
riage. His head dropped to one side,
a slight gurgle in his throat, and the
old man passed peacefully away. Grillo
drove to a convenient spot, tied his
team securely, and went 'to Mattley's
station and telephoned to his brother
for instructions as to what was best to
do. Supervisor Grillo notified tho
coroner, who gave instructions to bury
the deceased in Volcano. James Grillo
then drove to Mattley's, where, with
the assistance of Will Mattley, the re
mains were laid out to await the ar
rival of the dead wagon, which was
dispatched with all possible haste. Ar
riving in town the corpse was taken to
the undertaking parlors of Grillo 8r03.,
where it was prepared for interment.
Deceased had no relatives in this state.
He died among friends, who saw that
he had a Christian burial, and the liv
ing will sco that his grave is kept green.

NOTES FROM
THE MINERS
Bdnker Hill.— The first clean-up
of the new twenty stamp mill was made
last week. . The mill, owing to an acci
dent to the rock-breaker, was not kept
running to its ' full capacity for tbe
whole month, only ' ten stamps being
kept in. motion a part of the time. We
are not able to give the exact figures of
the clean-up, except that tbe , month's
run averaged something over $6 per
ton, which is a very satisfactory record,
and leaves a good margin of profit.
The ore came mostly from the 1200 foot
level, which is of poorer grade then
the ledge in the 800 and 1400 levels.
The clean-up is highly satisfactory to
the stockholders. ' ••'V'"*&
ZEiLAi — The underground, workers
were laid off temporarily at this mine
last Tuesday. This step was imperative
because -of tbe immense volume, of
water flowing into the works, requiring
the constant working of tbe water
tanks to : prevent the flooding of- the
lovels.' \ There is considerable compara
tively level land about the Zeila, with
some depressions, acting as a reservoir
for the surface water. Most of it drains
down into. the mine.'. Owing to these
exceptional conditions, while other
mines in the wet season have . about
double the amount of water to handle
as. compared with normal conditions,
the Zeila has fully six times as much.
It j was found impossible to keep the
mill supplied with ore, and keep the
water down at the same time. Hence
the stamps were hung up, and the
miners laid off. A few days of fine
weather will cause the water to slacken
and mining operations to be resumed.

evening. She was in the habit of milk

and savagely attacked her. Mrs. Fox
sustained a number of injuries, the
most serious being a wound in the ab
domen some three or four inches deep,
made by the cow's horn. The wound
was not straight inwards, and did not
penetrate the cavity . Nevertheless the
services of a surgeon were necessary to
dress the wound. Mrs. Fox is recover

A Time With BaU.
Nick Quirolo, of South Jackson, had
quite an exciting time killing rats at
his home last Saturday. In moving
some sacks of potatoes in a store room,
he came upon a nest of rats, seven in
all. The room is lined, and in looking
over the walls he saw tbe old rat and
ton half-grown ones. Wherever ho
would s.eo a rat he would place his hand
above it and work it down until he
found an opening, then he would take
them out and put them in a wire trap.
They had seven half-grown rats alive
at one time in the trap, and the noise
they made was like the chattering of a
nest of magpies. .

ALEXANDROVITCH
WILLIAM H. OSBORNE
Copyright, HW1, by T. C. McOlure....
Alexandrovltch was a man with- a
memory— a memory of deatli. Alex
androvltch was still young, almost a
boy, but he was younger then, when
he had met death and walked part way
with her hand In hand. It was sum
mer now, but then it had been winter.
Alexandrovitch, for the nonce cast out
of good employment, had started in on
Shankowitch's mare to trudge from
one village to another.
He did not make a fine appearance
altogether. His clothes were thin, and
he had tted^his hands and feet in bur
laps—burlaps picked up in the gutter—
and he had started off. Remember,
this had been some years ago. He had
started out, bending his muscular body
to the gale, pressing on in the teeth of
the wind.
He had started out; that was all. He
remembered but little else, for he was
but one-third of the way out of Nodo
losk when the blizzard struck him. But
on he went, running briskly to keep
the blood warm in his limbs and fol
lowing the road as best he could. And
then there had come a time when he
felt his very soul freeze within him.
He cried aloud in agony. But he press
ed on.
Suddenly all this was changed. In
place of the cold a drowsy warmth
spread over him. He thought that he
was lying wrapped in furs before some
great log fire. Red flames danced be
fore hia eyes. Alexandrovitch thought
that he danced and laughed aloud, he
felt so comfortable. But he did not.
He was simply staggering through the
deep snow, his head lolling from side
to side and his dark eyes staring at va
cancy. Finally he pitched headfore
most.
""Ah," muttered Alexandroviteh to
himself pleasantly, "this is indeed a
bed of down! Now shall I sleep and
sleep and sleep."
And Alexandrovitch slept. And the
blizzard roared about him. It was a
strange thing that but twelve feet to
the right of Alexandrovitch there was
a small cottage, almost covered with
the snow. Inside was a young girl,
the daughter of Abrain Saratovsky.
Saratovsky was a Jew, a Russian Jew.
There was but one window to this cot
tage, and in this window sat the young
girl, closely wrapped up in a rug, for
the cold entered and the snow drifted
in through the pane of glass. She was
peering out, watching the storm. Now
the snow dashed against the house
and blinded her. Then with a sudden
gust it would blow away and open up
a wide vista outdoors. During one of
these swirls the girl caught a glimpse
of something dark that lay prone upon
a bed of snow. She shuddered. This
girl was alone. The family bad gone
to market at a nearby village. There
they would stay until the storm had
spent its force. Anna Saratovsky peer
ed out at the dark spot in the snow.
Obeying a sudden Impulse, she rose and
ventured to the door. * Then she re
turned.
"It is nothing," she assured herself.
"It is not a man. I am seeing sights.
It is the storm." Again she peered out.
"It is— it is a man," she exclaimed to
herself— "a man who will surely freeze
to death 1"
She gathered her rug close about her.
Then with sudden energy she threw
open the little door and staggered, buf
feted by the storm, across the space
of twelve feet. It might just as well
have .been twelve yards. The storm,
which had designs upon Alexandro
vitch, prevented her from reaching
him. - But only for a time. Making an
extra effort, she cast off the rug that
hampered her, and then, with a sudden
leap, she plunged forward and fell
prone upon the dark object by the road
side. The object stirred.
lie is alive," exclaimed Anna Sara
tovsky—"alive, and I must save him!"
The next few moments made a wo
man out of a mere girl. The work of
those few moments was the work of a
lifetime. But she did it. Fifteen min
utes later Anna Saratovsky was rub
bing with snow the hands and face and
feet of a strong young man, who was
fair to look upon, and all the fairer be
cause he was In the valley of the shad
ow of death. At last she was rewarded.
Alexandrovitch slowly opened his eyes
and looked into the face of a beautiful
young girl. "You are one of the an
gels up in heaven," he murmured.
She shook her bead. "I am Anna
Saratovsky," she answered.
And all this was some years ago.
In Am | Saratovsky's village Alex
androvitch lived and moved and had
his being. He was a Russian, and she
was a Jewess, but' to him she was one
of the angels up In heaven.
It was early summer In the village.
One. night without a sound 200 men
stole each from his house and met un
der cover of the. darkness in the mar
ket place. Suddenly a mighty shout
went up from them.
"The Jews! The Jews!" they cried.
"Death to the Jews!" That was the
beginning; after that, battle, murder,
eudden death, blood and flre, flre and
blood. The men were Russians; their
neighbors were the Jews. " Each man
turned upon his neighbor; each man
armed himself and struck and struck
and struck to kill. They entered home
after home, dragging the innocents in
to the streets and slaughtering them
like cattle. Alexandrovitch was a Rus
sian. He, too, sought a house. He was
almost too late. Two people of the
name of Saratovsky lay weltering In
blood. They lay there at their door
post, where Alexandrovitch had lain so
many months before. Alexandrovitcb
looked upon them. His heart bled with
pity.
"If one could only have foreseen all
this!" he cried. "If I could have but
known I" Ha shuddered not with fear,
but with dread. He heard footsteps hi
the house. . .'."."<
"Anna— Anna Saratovsky 1" he cried
in a low voice. He heard an inarticu
late sound. Alexandrovitch strode over
the dead. ' He sought tbe living. He
peered into the house. In a corner a
silent struggle— a struggle to the death
—was belDg fought. It was a young
girl, Anna Saratovsky, gagged, but
with free hands that she had torn clear
of their bonds, fighting for dear life
against two men. It did not last long,
for Alexandrovitch was ' there. He
sprang into the midst and struck out
right and left.
"So, so, Boroskl,"_be cried to one of
the men. "It is you who are the das
tard. That for you, Boroshi! And that
for you, Mongolovltchl"
These two men were men that Alex
androvitch knew as well as he knew
his brother, but it was all one now,
for there was murder in the heart of
Alexandrovitch, even as there had been
murder In the heart of the two men,
for Alexandrovitch was fighting for
something more than his own life, and
he was a maniac for , the instant — a
wild beast Finally, he drew his hand
across' his brow and turned to Anna
Saratovsky. Then he stepped back and
opened a rear door. . -;
- "Anna Saratovsky," he said, "thy fa
ther and thy mother are beyond . all
aid; none can help them now. We must
even leave them where they are. The
Holy Mother will protect them. Come
Jjhou with me, Anna Saratovsky." He
Wd not give her time to hesitate. He
#bglit her in his arms and forced her
hrough the open door.
"Fly, Anna Saratovsky!" he whisper
ed In her ear. "Fly, for the flying
death comes after us."
It was a wild flight, that night of the
dread massacre. But at last the two
had left pursuit behind. As the day
began to break Alexandrovitch reached
forth his arm and lifted from the
ground the form of the fainting girl.
Then with his precious burden, he
Struck across the country. He reached
a small, secluded 'and deserted stable.
With the girl still In his arms he enter
ed. They crouched there in a corner.
Suddenly the girl .burst into hysterical
weeping. "My father and my rnoth
erl" she exclaimed. "My father and
my mother!"
Alexandrovitcb comforted her. " There
was a long silence . between them.
Suddenly Alexandrovitch bent down
his head. "Little one," "he whispered,
"thou art alone In this wide world,
tfhou didst save me once from death,
kly life belongs to you and yours to me.
Let us go through life together, little
one. Today our faith is one— our creed
is love."
.Anna Saratovsky citing to him.
"Whither thou goest," she whispered,
"t will go. Where thou lodgest I will
$dge. Thy people shall be my people,
thy* God my God."
Different From a Mountain.
. A certain Philadelphian, who is at
once a minister of the gospel and a reg
istered physician, had an amusing ex
perience in Ills attempt to corner a
Christian Scientist, according to the
Philadelphia Ledger.
Every time they met this scientist
took occasion to scoff at medical sci
ence and to dwell upon the wonders
that could be performed through faith.
. "You are convinced that through faith
you can do anythiug," said the medical
man one day. t
"Yes," he replied; "faith will move
mountains."
A week later he was in the doctor's
office with a swollen Jaw, due to tooth
ache.
"What! You here?" the doctor ex
claimed, 'with feigned astonishment.
"Oh, doctor," be said. "I have suf
fered agony all through the night. I
simply can't stand this pain any long
er."
"Have you tried faith?" the physi
cian asked him. "You know you told
me faith could move mountains."
"But this is a cavity, doctor."
A 'Worthy Man.
■When William E. Chandler was in
the United States senate he was visit
ed by a delegation from his home town,
Concord, N. H. The object was to
have Sir. Chandler assist in selecting
a ' candidate for mayor of Concord.
Name after name. was offered to the
senator only to be rejected. Finally a
delegate who was not especially pleas
ing to Mr. Chandler asked: "Well, who
in thunder do you want, anyway? How
are we going to know when a man
does possess the qualities that will en
title him to your approval?''
'•When you find a man who isn't
ashamed to show respect for women,
love for children and animals and who
will walk to the edge of the sidewalk
at midnight when no one is watching
to do his expectorating Into the street
you may be sure that he possesses all
the civic virtues and Is fully worthy
of any office you may be able to give
him," was the quiet response.
Washington Named It.
The question, "Who 'named the Em
pire State?" Is often asked,- but seldom
properly answered. General Washing
ton is the man to whom that and many
other honors belong. In his reply to
the "address of the common council of
New York city" the great general said:
"I pray that heaven bestow its choicest
blessings on your city; that a well reg
nlated and beneficial commerce may
enrich your citizens, and that your
state, at present the seat of empire,
may set such examples of wisdom and
liberality as shall have a tendency to
strengthen and give a permanency to
the Union at home and credit, and re
spectability abroad."
This la, of course, an. inferential al
lusion, but was the origin of New
York's popular name nevertheless.

AnlmnlH Enjoy Racing;.
Little pigs are great at combined
play, which generally takes the form
of races. Emulation seems to form
part of their amusement, for their races
seem . always to have the winning of
first place for their object and are quite
different from those combined rushes
for food or causeless stampedes In
which little pigs are wont to indulge.
Racing is an amusement natural to
some animals and, being soon taught
by. others, becomes one of their mosi
exciting pastimes.— London Tit-Bits.

Pedicuring an Elephant.
The tools, for trimming elephants' feet
are a carpenter's drawknife and a rasp
for the soles and a horseshoer"s knife
and sandpaper for the toe nails. The
operator places a beer keg or a strong
box behjnd one huge hind foot, "lightly
prods the thick ankle with his elephant
hook and commands tbe beast to ''Hold
up!" Up comes the mighty foot, slowly
and heavily, but obediently as the vel
vety paw of a kitten. The foot is rest
ed on the box or the keg, where it re
mains while the expert works on it
much as a horsesnoer pares the hoof of
a horse. Great slivers of the horny
sole are sliced off until it is" cut nearly
to proper thickness, when the rasp is
used to smooth off. Similarly the toe
nails are treated with the knife and the
sandpaper, while the big patient stands
with swinging trunk and an occasional
wag of an ear, too full of satisfaction
for utterance. When the turn of. the
forefoot comes, the great beast is made
to lie down on its side and the hoofs
are propped up and treated.— McClure's.
A Bird That Is Feared.
The elster (Pica candata) is a bird
that la respected and feared through
out south Germany. It belongs to the
raven tribe and Is about the size of a
dove, with black and white feathers
and long, pointed tall. It builds its
nest in orchards, and its life Is sacred.
If it Is seen three times in succession
on the same house top In a place re
mote from its home it is believed to be
a sure sign of death in that house. If
it flies and gives its peculiar cry the
sick person is sure to die, but If It
does not scream the patient may re
cover. It is better for the sick per
son if the bird does not come near.
No one could be hired to bother these
birds for fear they might seek revenge,
and if by chance one of them should
die it is a sign of bad luck to the owner
of the property where it is found.
The bird Is a .valuable insect destroyer
and in this way probably more than
compensates for the fear it occasions
among the farmers.
Animals Become- Insane.
Insanity in the human subject is sup
posed by some to have no analogue In
the lower animals. Yet many cases,
according to Dr. Sneilson, will lead to
the permanent loss of. self control.
Cattle driven from the country through
a crowded town will often work
themselves into a frenzy. Horses
have gone mad on the battlefield. At
Balaklava an Arabian horse turned on
its attendant,' threw him down and,
kneeling on him, attacked him like an
infuriated dog. An instance is related
of a docile horse suddenly going mad
on a hot day. Everything that came
in its way it seized in its teeth and
shook as a terrier does a rat. A scien
tist of authority even goes so far as to
prove by what appears to be incontest
able evidence that cata, dogs and
monkeys have been observed to have
delusions very similar to those of in
sane people.— London Globe.
Dividing the Sexes.
While worshiping in a little chapel
of-ease a few- miles from Ituthln, on
the Wrexham road, the sexes are so
strictly divided that they cannot even
see one another. The building forms a
right angle, in one arm of which the
men sit and the women in the other.
It was built and endowed by a mi
sogynist of the Stuart period who ob
jected to having his devotions distract
ed by the sight of the hated sex and,
sympathizing with male posterity,
stipulated expressly for this division
In his deed of endowment— London
Standard.
The Cuban Workman.
The Cuban workman is a kind hus
band and a fond father of a family
usually of patriarchal size. He lives
simply. At the bedega he buys hia
tasajo (jerked beef), rice, vegetables
and cheap wine, and very savory are
the stews his meek little wife prepares
at the one hearty meal of the day,
about 5:30 p.-m. The Cuban eats but
twice daily. He is underfed and over
stimulated. He has coffee at 7 a. m.,
a light breakfast at 11 a. m and eats
bis chief meal at twilight.— Southern

Rapid Typewriting.
An official stenographer, Doming, at
Albany, years ago reported court pro
ceedings on a typewriter at the rate of
150 and 170 words a minute. He elim
inated the vowels, using consonants
only, with a dot to separate words.
His typewriter was incased in glass to
deaden the noise. ' The paper was run
into the machine from a roll. Lawyers
could read the notes: ° .
Happiness. -'
"I am sometimes accused," writes
Sir John Lubbock, "of being too op
timistic. But I have never ignored nor -
denied the troubles and sorrows of life.
I hare never said that men are happy,
but only that they might be; that if
they are not so the fault is generally
their own; that most of us throw away
more happiness than we enjoy." i
i
Too Deserving.
A young village maiden h"ad obtained
the modesty prize. "I suppose then,
my child,", said a -Parisian lady ad
dressing her, "you are the most modest
girl in the parish?" .!
"There is riot the slightest doubt
about that, ma'am, and it's a down
right shame I didn't get all the other
prizes!"— Paris Journal.
A Hard Proposition.
One of the hardest things for a man
to do when he has come home late
from the club and tried to go to bed
without taking off hia collar is to ex
plain to his wife he heard it was a
good cure for. sore throat. — New York
Press.
