THE MAN WHO
CAME BACK
[Copyright, 1905, by McClure, Phillips & Co.]
People who could remember Samuel
Hastings as a boy and a young man
and Xancy Lee as a girl and a young
woman could not recall that either of
Fjem was particularly dlspv£atious or
obstinate. When the two got married
it was called a good match, and all
seemed to go well for three or four
months. Then it was known that argu
ment and dispute were the order of the
day, » iT; '
About a year after marriage and aft
er they had had numerous disputes and
separations Samuel came up from the
potato field one day and said: .
. "Ding my buttons, but them potato
bugs are just going for the vines to
beat all creation. I wonder why they
have so many more legs than a bug."
"They haven't," replied the wife.
"Yes, they have. They've got sixteen
legs, and you can't find a bug with
over twelve."
"They haven't got but ten legs. I was
looking at one this afternoon."
"Sixteen, Nancy."
"Only ten, Samuel."
. I was a boy twelve years old and
working for the family, and I heard
the dispute. There was no anger in it,
but each party -was mulish and deter
mined. They kept up the dispute for
three hours, and at length the husband
said:
"Nancy, I'm not going to stand any
more of this. If you lusist that a later
bug has only got ten legs, I'll leave the
house." »
"I say ten and shall stick to it, and
if you want to leave you can."
Next morning Samuel left. He had
about §10 in money and a bundle of
clothes, and he did not say where he
was going— in fact, he walked off with
out a word, and the wife stood in the
door and saw him go and made no ef
fort to detain him. It was a small
farm, and when he had been gone" a
week she hired a man to do the heavy
work, and things went on as usual.
One day, a year and a half later, the
missing husband walked Into the house.
He' looked about as usual, and hung
his hat up In the same old place as if
perfectly at home.
"Howdy, Nancy?" he saluted, and she
saluted him the same way.
Dinner was just ready, and! be sat
down at the head of the table. They
talked about the farm and the crops
and the weather, and when he' was
through eating he shoved back and
said:, "•■■' . . -_■.
"Well, Nancy, are you ready to give
in that a tater bug has sixteen legs?"
"Nope. ' I know. they have only ten,"
she replied.
"Are you going to stick to it?" '
"Till Idle." - - .
"And I shall stick to sixteen."*
He picked his teeth for awhile with
out anything more being said and then
rose slqwly up, walked 'outdoors and
was not seen or heard of again for over
two years. His own people did not
know where he was* and held no corre
spondence with him. The matter was
of course known to everybody for five
miles around, and there were many
who thought It their duty to wrestle
with Nancy. She would listen to all
they had to say, and when they had
finished her reply was: ->:. . •
"Just as long as Sam Hastings can
stick to sixteen I can stick to ten, and
he may stay away and Ibe hanged to
him."
Samuel's home corning on. the second
occasion was a good deal like the first.
His wife .sat on the veranda sewing
one summer afternoon when he turned
in from the dusty highway with a bun
dle on his shoulder. She knew him as
soon as she saw him, but she made no
fuss over It When he had reached the
veranda he laid down his bundle and
said:
"Well, Nancy, I don't see that you
have changed much."
"Nor you either."
"Feeling purty well?"
"First rate." . '
"So'm I."
Then they discussed the neighbors
for an hour, and she said:
"I suppose you will stay to supper?"
"Oh, I guess so."
. He stayed, but when the meal was
finished he asked:
"About them tater bugs?"
"They have still got ten legs," she re
plied.
"Couldn't, make 'em sixteen, could
you?"
"Not if I was to be burned at the
stake. Samuel, you know what a' de
termined woman I am."
- "What a mule, you mean."
"Then you are just as big a one.
Just as long as you stick to sixteen I
shall stick to ten."
"Then goodby to you."
Three minutes later he was out of
the gate and going down the road, and
things went on In the old routine
again. This time five long years pass
ed away. Then the Widow Hastings,
as she had long been called, got up
one morning to find Samuel sitting In
a chair by the kitchen stove. He had
entered the bouso some time during
the night without disturbing anybody.
Ho sat witli Ins elbow.i on his knees
and bis chin in hi.? bunds, but she knew
him nt a glance.
"So you arc home again?"' she asked.
He made no reply. .. -
"I suppose you still stick to sixteen
legs?"
No answer.
"Because if you do"—
She had gone closer to him and. saw
that he was dead, nis hair had be
come gray, he was thin and poor in
flesh and there were signs that he had
been ill a long time.
"I was going to split the difference
with you this time and call it twelve!"
she said as she lnlti her head down on
the table and wept. M. QUAD.

that he could not do and several
things he did not know.
Draw Straws To Win Bride.
Three brothers— John, William and
Henry Mnok— all well-to-do, Hve'in
Davie county, North Carolina. Near
the Mock home lives the family of
Jacob Depass, and the chief ornament
of this family was Miss Nellie Depass.
Each one of the Mook "boys was in
love with Miss Nellie, and' had told
her so many times, vowing his life
would be utterly wot thless unless the
beauty would become, his wife.^ •■'.•'.
Miss Nellie decided that she would
have a wedding, and she told eaoh one
of the brothers to get ready as though
he were to be the favored one, and
the two who failed to get j her could
be best men and wait on their more
fortunate brother. ' '• '. ■'.
.Last night Miss Nellie walked into
the parlor in her finest costume and
announced that she had decided, to
let .the brothers draw straws to see
which she should marry. She said
she would manipulate the straws, as
sho was "disinterested." '
When. the straws. were. laid.. on the
center table to be inspected it was
found that the youngest brother .had
drawn the shortest straw. Immediate
ly Miss Nellie took his arm, and the
bridesmaids' and' their attendants
arranged themselves in front . of the
family minister, who was there for
tbe occason. In five minutes Mies
Nellie was Mrs. Henry Mock. :

The telemobiioscope, designed by a
Dusseldorf inventor, for enabling a
pilot to detect a ship near at hand in
a fog, depends upon the tact that
electric waves are reflected when they
strike a metnllio" object. The appar
atus consists of a long" box or tube,
pivoiWat ~one end- and open at the
other, containing a spark generator
near the pivoted end and two lenses
for collecting the electric waves into
a bundle. A suitable m_otor turns
the box horizontally on the vertical
pivot. As the box, slightly inclined
toward the water, is "swung around,
the electric waves are projected out
ward, and if they strike an object
containing metal they are reflected
back, aoting upon a receiver similar
to that used in wireless telegraphy.
This receiver is influenced only by
return waves. When a vessel is dis
covered, the apparatus is turned nntil
the reflection is strongest, when a
good estimate of the distance can be
One's hair, if never cut, would
fnrnish a record of his health during
life. This is the interesting discovery
of Matsura, a, Japanese physiologist,
who shows that tho hair— like the
finger-nails — grows smaller in
disease, and that the duration of the
malady may be estimated from the
length of the thinner section, of the
hairs. The variations are most strik
ing in the coarse-haired races of
people. .
If odors were solid paiticles they
would tend to form nuclei of cloudy
condensation in supersaturated air.
Dr.. John Aitken has tested musk
and twenty-three other odorous sub
stances without rinding such nuclei,
and he concludes that odors are gase
ous and that, smell has gas as its fun
damental^basis. r. :7 .; . •
A novel electric station-indicator,
the invention of a Danish engineer,
is id use upon a Berlin tramway. The
apparatus is contained in. a glass-faced
wooden case, and shows the name, of
the next station in a conspicuous
place over the door of the car. , The
names of the stations are on a roll ot
paper which is moved orer two drums
by a clockwork motor, a ratchet
wheel stopping the roll at each name,-
At proper places along the. overhead
wire are annex wire 3 or bars, and
when one of these comes ,;in contact
with a tongue or extra wire on : . the
trolly pole, a current impulse passes
to an. electro-magnet, which releases
the ratchet and allows the cylinders
to move forward to the next stop,
showing the station name next in
order. . %
A curious victim of hasty conclusion
seems to be the kea, whose, extermin
ation is likely to result from its rep
utation throughout New. Zealand as
a sheep-killer. It is generally be
lieved that this parrot kills many
animals by a oruel way of pecking
into their sides, but a recent careful
investigation fails to give the slightest
evidence ot this habit. The investi
gators decide that the bird's ill
repute has arisen from! its inordinate
curiosity, somebody having jumped
at tho inference of. slaughter when it
was simply inspecting a dead carcase.
A singular maple tree j on the left
bank of the Oder, in Germany, is at
least a century old, and has been
twisted and cut into a ;kind of cir
cular house of two stories. .A' firm
leaty floor has been formed by causing
the branches to become gradually
woven together. Above this is a
smaller second floor, similarly form
ed, and the ends of the branches have
been woven into solid walls, in which
eight windows on each story have
been cut. . .
The highest kite ascent was lately
made at Lindenberg, Prussia, 21,100
feet being reached, with six attached
kite 3 aiid 15,000 yards of wire. Tho
temperature fell from 41 degrees at
tho surface to 13 degrees below zero;
the wind — 18 miles aft surface — was
56 miles an hour at highest point.
In using incandescent mantles for
gas lighting, the illumination is
found to increase tor a time, then
it steadily diminishes. , The rise at
Urst is thought to be due to a gradual
shaping to the flame, and. the sub
sequent gradual failure is attributed
to two causes. Dust particles of
silica drawn against the mantle by
the air currents . form infusible
silicates of small illuminating power.
The more important cause of degener
ation, however, is the slow volatiliz
ation of the ceria, to which the in
candescence is due. The amount ot
moisture in the air has slight effect
on the light of a mantle.
Luminous electric radiators aro
claimed by 11. J. Dowsing, the Brit
ish electrician, to offer important
advantages. They can be taken from
room to room where needed, they can
bo placed in the most effective posi
tions, tho rays can be applied to heat
ing the lower part of the room or the
part where heat is needed, the heat
cau bo turned on and off instantane
ously, there is no combustion, and no
special vontillatiou is required. For
cold days or cold parts of a room
they are specially, economical. The
ready elllcioncy goes fur to offset the
loss in converting energy Into elec
tric current and then into heat, and
makes electricity a competitor with
gas for heating. -"
Ihe production of coal ornaments
is one of Japan's interesting indust
ries. The hardest and best pieces of
coal aro carefully saved by the
miners, and these are cut into a great
variety of shapes, and mounted in
rings, trinkets and chains, or used
for the heads of canes and umbrellas
or for other novelties. A chaJn
lately sold is of solid black coal,
each link being perfectly cut. .
A superior fuel brick of equal parts
ot peat and coal has been evolved at
a tlremen brickyard. The mixture
resulted from many experiments, and
after failure to put the peat to use
for paving bricks.
Political Railroad Rates.
; Shippers who think any substantial
gain for their business interests can
be secured through rates made by
political offloials rather than by
traffic managers acting for owners
should give careful consideration to
the experience of France.
It appears from a statement made
by. M. (J. Noblemaire, traffic manager
ot the Paris-Lyons-Mediterranean
Kailway, that political rate-making
obtains in that country. This results
in compelling the transportation cor
porations to abandon all effort to
manage their business in conformity
with the requirements of trade.
They dare not make reductions to
meet emergencies, because political
consideration would prevent them
from returning to a higher rate when
the emergency had passed. When the
rate-making power is delegated to a
political administrative body it i's
inevitable that ita recommendations
will be due to political pressure from
some locality or industry, and thero
fore generally not along sound busi
ness lines. /
Such conditions cannot possibly
benefit shippers to the degree that
they, can realize from the flexible
system now in operation in this
country, under which transportation
corporations make rates and put
them in immediate operation, subject
to judicial roview only upon com
plaint of unreasonableness.— From

Hints to Housekeepers.
Sprinkle salt on the carpet in sev
eral places. No bother from so much
dust and brightens up the carpet.
Without care knives not in use soon
spoil. Keep them in a box in which
sifted quicklime: has been/ placed.
The blades should be covered with
this, but it must . not touch tne
handles, which should bo occasionally
exposed ' to the air to keep them from
turning yellow.
Tbe ascetic acid of vinegar is iv
request for all sauces. It mingles
well with the citric acid of -lemon
juioe. In making mayonnaise of any
kind, this ascetic acid of the vinegar
is required in mixture with as many
flavors as possible, hence tarragon,
chili and celery vinegars are used.
Unless washed with great -care
black stockings soon turn a greenish
color. They shuold be washed in
soap and rinsed in water to' which a
teaspoonful of vinegar has been added.
When damp press them into shape,
but do not iron, as the heat tends to
destroy the color.
It is well that housewives, should
know that paper bags are made \of a
compound of rags, lime, glue .and
similar substances, mixed .with
chemicals and acids. - When dry these
can do no harm, but if allowed 'to
become damp a?paper bag is unfit to
touch articles of food. Never, there
fore, keep food that is of a " damp or
juicy nature in a paper bag. ■
Beeswax and turpentine polish for
linoleum is hard to beat as far as its
appearance is , cunoerned, but it has
one defect- -it causes a slipperiness
which may be dangerous to children
and old people. A polish which has
no such objection is made of equal
parts of linseed oil and vinegar.
Apply a little to a flannel cloth, rub
it well on the linoleum aud polish
with a clean, dry cloth.
The blanching of nuts is a process
often thought difficult because not
understood. ibe nuts should be
covered with boiline water and should
be allowed to stand for 10 minutes
where they will keep hot but not
cook. Then drain them, plunge them
into cold water, and chill them. A
knife must be used with English wal
nuts because ot" their serrated surface.
Pistaohio nuts aie bard to blanch,
aud the water in which they soak
needs to actually boil while they are
in it, although they must not cook.
Don't Deceive Yourself.
Don't deceive yourslf. If you have
indigestion take Kodol dyspepsia
cure, it will relieve you. Key. W.
E. Hooutt, South Mills, N. C, says:
"I was troubled -with chronic in
digestiou for several years; whatever
1 ate seemed to cause heartburn, sour
stomach, fluttering of my heart, and
general depression of mind and body.
My druggist recommended Kodol, and

A New Idea.
All old-time cough syrups bind the
bowels. This is wrong. A new idea
was advanced two years ago in Kenn
edy's Laxative Honey and Tar. This
remedy - acts 'on the mucous mem
branes, of the throat and lungs and
loosens tbe bowels at the same time.
It expels all cold from tbe system.
It clears the throat, strengthens the
mucous membranes, - relieves coughs,
colds, croup, whooping cough, etc.

FRIDAY FEBRUARY 2, 1906
County Politics.
Amador county will soon be plung
ed in the whirlpool of another con
test for the possession of the county
offices. The main issue will be— as
it always has been— the outs against
the ins. It is unfortunate for public
interests that such is in reality the
chief feature of a local election. The
mere personality of the men, who
shall serve Amador county for the
next' term is really a small matter in
comparison with other issues, which
ought to be pressed to (he front, and
submitted to the popular vote in a
manner that will not permit of any
side tracking tactics.' At this early
period, it is not out of plaoe to
discuss some things that loudly
clamor' tor redress. We believe the
republican party— the party that has
a strong majority, in this county — a
majority that ought to insure the
election of every man on its local
ticket, provided that ticket .is com
posed of material that is reasonably
acceptable to republicans generally—
should take hold of these live issues,
and make a determined effort to settle
them in accordance with the wishes
of the people. Citizens of Amador
are a thinking class. In county
affairs they do not hesitate to scratch
a man on their party ticket providing
they deem a candidate on the opposite
tioket more deserving of their sup
port. This spirit of independence is
commendable. It is laden with the
promise of reform. The Ledger—
strongly republican though it be—
has nought to say in its discourage
ment; notwithstanding the fact which
stands out in bold relief in the
political history of recent years,' that
republicans are , more disposed to
assert their independence in this
regard than their opponents. In
support of this statement, it is only
neoessarily to point oat that with
republican sentinfent in the ascend
ancy of between 200 and 300 votes,
the democrats to-day fill nearly all
the local offices. These democrats
owe their election to republican
votes. The thing to be deplored in
this regard is that considerations for
the public wear is not always made
the touchstone at the ballot box. But
we mast deal with conditions as they
exist, not as we would wish them to
be. No doubt the majority of the
members of both the great political
patties desire that fitness and cap
ability should alone be considered in
the selection of public servants.
Equally important with the per
sonal popularity of the make-up ot
the ticket, is the adoption of a plat
form on local questions — a platform
of economy and retrenchment that
candidates for legislative positions
especially shall be pledged to support,
and use their utmost endeavors to
put into practical ettect. The people
are getting heartily sick of this appar
ently endless policy of piling up ex
pense upon the taxpayers by legisla
tive enactments. It has gone on for
years, with only now and then a stern
potest entered against the system.
Representatives go to their duties
apparently under the impression that
the chief business is to look after the
office-holding class, and see to it
that the emoluments shall be boosted.
Scarcely a legislature has met, but
this spirit has found vent in one di
rection or another to the detriment of
the public service, and for the
benefit of the few. Furthermore, by
a studied system of unwise legisla
tion, sources of county revenue that
years ago famished an important
item of income, have been cut down,
or out off altogether, and diverted to
the pockets ot political hangers-on.
The citizens and property-holders
generally nave had to make good this
loss. The result has been a steadily
growing tax rate. Is it not time that
a -new departure was inargurated.
The policy of graft-for that la the
most correct term to apply to snch
methods— should •be stopped. We
trust the republican party will take
a firm stand on this matter. It is by
far the most burning Issue that faces
Amador county; and the man that
forces the fight to the finish will be
the most practical reformer and
benefactor this section has met for a
generation.
Bough Hands Made Smooth.
A man who once had rough horny
hands made them soft and smooth

sores, boils, cuts, burns, bruises,
etc., it has no equal, and affords
almost immediate relief from Dlind

The Ledger office has secured a
small quarter horse power electric
motor, of the most approved style
specially designed for operating type
setting machines. It arrived early
this week, and will be installed in a
few days, to furnish the motive power

has heretofore been ■ run by water

Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign.
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. For
weak indigestion, for defective nour
ishment, for consumption, take
Scott's Emnlsion. It restores flesh
because it strikes to the cause of the
loss.
Ayers
For coughs, colds, bronchitis,
asthma, weak throats, weak
lungs, consumption, take
Ayer's Cherry Pectoral.
Cherry
Pectoral
Always keep a bottle of it in
the house. We have been
saying this for 60 years, and
so have the doctors.

Gillett A Candidate.
Congressman J. N. Gillett. of this
district, in response to inquiries con
cerning his alleged candidacy for the
'governorship of this state, has sent
the following telegram to friends in
Eureka :
"My friends started the movement,
and if the convention offers me the
nomination t shall consider it my
duty to accept."
This settles the question, Gillett
will undoubtedly be a contestant to
head the repubhoan ticket in the
coming election. He will have strong
backing in the northern sections.
Those who have taken his candidacy
in hand will exert themselves to the
ptmost from now on to advance his
interests.

The readers of this paper will ba
pleased to learn that there is at least
one dreaded disease that science has
been able to cure in all its stages and
that is Catarrah. Hall's Catarrah Cure
is the only positive cure now known to
the medical fraternity. Catarrah be
ing a constitutional disease, requires a
constitutional treatment. Hall's Catar
rah Cure is taken internally, acting
directly upon the blood and mucous
surface of the system, thereby destroy
ing the foundation of the disease, and
and giving the patient strength by
building up the constitutional and as
sisting nature in doing its work. The
proprietors have so much- faith in its

1 TOWtK CftKAtIAM Coaiaittd.TOtOHTolaW:
The Taylor Mansion Finished.
The residence of B. F. Taylor
situated at the corner of Pitt and
Stump street, is practically completed,
and awaits the inspection of the
architect, Mr Walsh ot San Francisco,
before being formally turned over to
the owner as completed. Ihe archi
tect is expeoted up this' eceuiug to
pronounce his approval.
This handsome dwelling is by far
the most artistic, convenient, and
elegant home to be found in Amador
county. No building of the kind
has ever been undertaken before on
so complete and elaborate a scale
within Amador county.'
The site is an ideal one for a resi
dence. At the junction of Pitt and
Stump streets, in the eastern part of
the city, and at a slight elevation, it
commands a view of the whole town,
at the same time being away from the
heavily traveled thoroughfares. The
entrance from the street is by a flight
of step, the stairway with the round
ed piers or either side being a work of
art in itself.
The mansion itself, with the front
porch rests on solid cement found
ations, built up about 10 feet from
the ground.
The first thing that attracts notice
is the spacious porch, ten. feet vftde,
and supported by solid circular
columns, extending over sixty feet;
fronting the two streets. :-' ; >:
From the -outside the beholder is
impressed with the symmetrical ap
pearance; as well as the fact that
nothing in expense has been spared
in making it the most palatial home
in these parts.
The residence consists of two stories
proper, with attic space above, and
a cellar with concrete floors under
neath, for storage purposes. The
ground floor consists of six rooms be
sides the spacious hallway, into which
the front door opens. On the east
side is the parlor, and on the west the
sitting room. Uther rooms are the
bedrooms, dining room, kitchen,
pantry, all fixed up with every con
venience. The kitchen is very nicely
arranged having a modern range, hot
water apparatus, hot and cold water
extending to every room in the house
upstairs and down. There is a
dumb waiter connecting the kitoheu
with the cellar below, for hoisting
provisions. A sideboard, between
the kitchen and dining ' room enables
things to be 'passed from, one room
to the other without the neoessity of
opening doors.
Tne upstairs consists of five sleep
ing apartments, all furnished with
closets, and permanent washstands.
The interior woodwork, baseboards,
doors and windows are finished in
imitation ot natural oak. The wain
scoating is of lincrista, -of various
patterns, to suit the' different apart
ments. There are fire grates through
out the ground floor, two being
arranged for burning gas, and the
other for wood or ooal. The ' fronts
are laid with tiles, those in the dining
room being of Roman pattern, and
the others of different colors, all giv
ing an air of comfort and elegance.
For lighting, it is arranged for both
eleotrioity and gas. There are be
tween 40 and 50 eleotric lamps, with
gas fixtures to fall back upon in case
of a failure of the electric current.
All the windows upstairs are of the
Dean patent. Each sash is so arrang
ed that it can be swung around on a
pivot, enabling the outside to be
cleaned trom within. Indeed, every
thing about the plaoe is up-to-date, and
according to the most approved styles.
The inside plastering is a fine piece
of work, all the corners being provid
ed with metallic guards to prevent
chipping of the plaster. Not a crack
or a flaw can be detected throughout.
The contractor, A. H: Kublman, is
entitled to much credit for tho work
manship displayed in carrying out
his contract. He started last July,
and it has kept him and a force of
mechanics busy to get though with
the work. Not a flaw of any kind
can be discovered. '
Mrs Taylor left Sunday morning for
Stockton, Sacramento and San Fran
cisco. She will purchase the furni
ture for the new home, which is to be
new throughout, and of a character in
keeping with the rest. They will not
move from the old residence near by
until everything is in order, which
will probably be some time this
month.
The outside painting lacks the
finishing coat. This is to be of white,
and will be deferred, on account of
climatic reasons until the spring.
The total cost of this magnificent
strncture, when every thing is com
plete, will be between §12,000 and
815,000.
Death of Mrs. Winnie Love.
Winnie .Love, wife of W. J. Love,
died at her home in the north portion
of the city on Monday morning, at
six o'clock, alter a short "illness of
pneumonia. She contracted a cold
about three weeks ago, which quickly
developed, into pneumonia, and
sapped the foundations of life, lie
sides a husband, she leaves four
children, also a mother, Mrs J. Ryan,
and a brother, Thos. Ryan. The
funeral was held Wednesday, the Rev.
Father Gleason officiating, sei vices
being conducted in the Catholic

A Broad Hint
[Original.]
The town of Brookmeadow was built
on two adjoining contiguous plots In a
far western territory. It was not a
large town, the Inhabitants numbering
not more than 100 families, and nearly
all of these were original settlers. The
people of Brookmeadow did not en
courage newcomers. They were a hard
headed sort and did not take kind
ly to mushroom growth. "What good
would it do us," said a citizen to one
who asked what Inducements the peo
ple would ' give him to settle among
them, "to get in a lot of strangers? As
we are, we don't need any gov'ment ex
cept on special occasions. No, sir, we
don't want strangers."
One day a settler came to town who
did not ask permission— a sleek, oily
man who could absorb Information as
silently as the sun sucks up water, but
never gave out any. A few days after
his arrival a "shingle" was hung out
on the street bearing the inscription
"Anthony Waxem, Attorney-at-Law."
Brookmeadow thus iar .had no pro
fessional man except a doctor and a
parson. The Introduction of a lawyer
was considered superfluous, and the
question was raised whether Mr. Wax
em be allowed to remain. "What's the
use a-doln' anything," said old Hon
ker, "as will do itself? If a lawyer
can make a llvin' In this community,
for my part I'd let him stay. It's my
opinion he'll starve." Old Honker's
opinion was held In great respect In the
town, and it was decided that the law
yer should not be Interfered with.
When Mr. Waxem had been In Brook
meadow three months no citizen had
given him a case, and it was not be
lieved that he had had a case. He had
spent much of his time away and had
• been seen by several of his fellow
townsmen at -different times at the
frame shanty located at the county
seat called the courthouse. But, since
he had no law business and no pros
pects of any, his early departure was
looked for.
One morning there was a surprise
sprung on the citizens of Brookmead
ow. When they gathered at the post
offlce to get their mall the postmaster
handed each and every owner of prop
erty carved out of one of the contigu
ous tracts on which the town was built
a note bearing on the corner of the en
velope the name of "Anthony Waxem,
Attorney-at-Law." The recipients of
these notes were Informed that there
was a flaw in the title of the original
tract whereon then* property was lo
cated. Mr. Waxem had picked up the
flaw and for a consideration would
give a quitclaim deed to every lot If
this was not satisfactory he gave no
tice that he would begin suits of eject
ment
Thus half the citizens of Brookmead
ow had been euchred by the man whom
they had been waiting to see starve
or depart They were not an ex
citable people, but every man left the
postofQce with a lowering brow. That
evening a group of prominent citizens
assembled In' the meeting house and
appointed a committee to have the rec
ords searched with a view to deter
mining Mr. Waxem's position, and If
It was secure to take such measures
as were necessary toward clearing the
title. :':•;■
It was one week before the commit
tee were ready to act; then they went
In a body to Mr. Waxem's office. That
gentleman, being perfectly confident
of his legal position and believing that
they had come to offer a compromise,
though he received them urbanely, re
solved that he would not give an inch
from his original demands." ' •
"Mr. Waxem," said the chairman,
"we have taken legal advice and find
that you -ate right. But these people
bought their lots in good faith and will
not pay blood money. Many of them
can't afford to pay, and if you Insist
they must be turned out of their
homes. Now, we have decided to give
up that part of the town the title of
which you are Interested in to you,
removing all the houses to the other
tract. Will that satisfy you?"
"Perfectly," said the lawyer, consid
ering the proposition a bluff.
"With one proviso," continued the
chairman— "that the property held by
you ls to be used for a cemetery."
This singular provision somewhat
puzzled Mr. Waxem.
"We shall need," continued the
chairman, "a corpse with which to
open the cemetery, and we have
thought that In order to do away with
all dispute in . reference to the title
that corpse should be the person hold-
Ing an undisputed right to occupy the
property."
As the chairman spoke the last words
h© opened a package he carried- under
bis arm rolled in an old newspaper
and displayed about twenty feet of
rope, at one end of which was a noose.
Mr. Waxem had by this time caught
the spirit of the argument and turned
pale.
"Since the dedlcatiai and opening of
the new cemetery," the chairman went
on, "are appointed for tomorrow after
noon at 3 o'clock perhaps we'd better
prepare the' corpse."
The chairman cast his, eyes to the
ceiling with a view to discovering
something to which the rope might be
fixed. Mr. Waxem shook from the bald
spot on the top of his head to the soles
of his boots.
"Maybe," suggested one of the com
mittee, "Mr. Waxem would prefer to
prepare the corpse himself." Would
you, Mr. Waxem?"
Mr. Waxem promised that the corpse
should be ready on time, and the com
mittee departed. The next morning the
law office was closed and the lawyer
nowhere to be seen. He had taken the
hint and left on the midnight train.

MORE SAFE CRACKING.
Piccardo's Saloon on Jackson Gate
Road Robbed of Money, etc.
A peculiar robbery occuned at
the saloon ot Andrew Piccardo, on
the Jackson Gate road, some time dur
ing Friday night ot last week. This is
the same place that Genrge Gates at
tempted to hold up some three years
ago. It seems that the saloon was
closed at the usual hour that night
about nine o'clock. No one slept on
the premises, either in the saloon
proper or in rooms above, which in
the days of freight teaming, were
occupied "as sleeping quarters by
teamsters. Entrance was made into
the rcom over the saloon by means
of a door in the rear.' The burglars
first provided themselves with the
necessary implements from Piocardo's
blacksmith shop close by. From this
they took a brace and bit, and a key
hole saw, which they left on the pre
mises after, accomplishing their work,
together with a strange key hole saw,
of amateur manufacture. This im
plement is a curiosity in its way. No
one knows whence it came, but it is in
th"c possession '[ofJtbeXofflcerß, and
may possibly be a olew to unlock the
mystery.
Having got to the upper room, they
took the precaution of hanging a
blanket over "the doorway, thereby
shutting off the light, 'which other
wise might have been seen from the
Piccardo residence. Thus concealed,
they were free to operate on the ceil
ing over the saloon. They sawed
away sufficient of the boards between
the joists to form a manhole, and got
to the scene of plunder. There were
two iron fireproof safes. By a sing
ular fatuity both of them were left
open— that is the' combination was
not turned on. Another peculiar
circumstance is that the inner door
of one safe was also unlocked. The
other was locked, but the key was left
hanging up in the saloon. The rob
bers found where it was placed, and
used it to open the door. From the
two safes they took $130 in coin, and
two gold watches and two gold chains.
One of the watches belonging to
Piccrdo,cost §185. The other belonged
to George Sullivan, and its value we
are not able to give. Sullivan is in
the county hospital. Not a thing was
interfered with about the premises ex
cept the trifling of the sales. Not a
bottle of whiskey,' or any other liquor
was touched. The burglars seemed to
have gone about their work in a care
fully, planned manner, and left be
hind nothing except the strange saw
herein referred to. It is belived that
the work was done by some person or
persons well acquainted with the pre
mises. One person could do it all as
easily as two or more. The officers
have been trying to unravel it, but so
far their efforts have not been reward
ed, at least to the extent of justifying
any arrest.

Biographical.
(Communicated.)
Robert Gilliland Calvin, who died
at the county infirmary on the 20th
of this month, was one of the early
pioneers of this State. He was born
in the state of New York on March
28, 1829, being 76 years, 9 months
and 23 days old at the time of his
death.":;:;
When gold was lirst discovered here,
and the mad rush began, he was work
ing at his trade in South Bend,
Indiana. At that time he and Chas.
Crocker, later the. railroad million
aire, were in the employ of the same
firm. He, like others who had
ambition to become rich, was seized
with the gold fever. In the winter
or early spring of 1849 he left South
Bend for New York, intending to
oome by water to the land of gold.
Took a boat and landed on the
Isthmus, after a rough voyage of
about two months. Hundreds of
people were congregated on the
Pacific slope of Panama, arid were not
able to secure transportation to Cali
fornia, owing to the scarcity at that
time of vessels. After remaining
there over three months, he and about
200 others, at a cost ot §250 each,
chartered a schooner, and arrived in
San Francisco Nov. 29, 1849. From
there he went to Coloma, and alter
accumulating several thousand dol
lars, went to Michigan Bar, Sacra
mento county, and embarked with a
man named Valentine in the general
merchandise business, in which he
was very successful. But like all
other early pioneers, he continued
mining.
Whoever oame along and wanted a
grub stake, went to "Bob," as he was
called in those days, and was never
refused. He also invested in several
gravel propositions, which were
money losing propositions, with the
result that in a few years he had lost
all he had gained. From Michigan
Bar he came to Amador county, re
mained here until 1871 when he took
his famiily to Sacramento, and after
losing his wife there, moved to Wood
land, Yolo county, and from there he
went to Placerville, where he con
ducted a tin shop for a number of
years. Having become too aged and
feeble to longer work, he came back
to Amador about six years ago, and
since . that time up to a few months
before his death made his home with
his sons, George and Harvey. In the
death of "Bob" Calvin, the mining
region of California has lost one of
its oldest pioneers. He was a' man
of many friends and tew enemies,
and never knowingly wronged any
one. He never had but one physical
enconnter after he arrived to man
hood. One day in Coloma, -a gang ot
claim jumpers attempted to run him
off of his claim. He very seldom
carried weapons, but in lieu thereof
he seized a cobble stone from the
tailings pile, and knocked one of his
assailants down, while the others ran
for the hills. He never was bothered
after that. He leaves three sons,
one daughter, oue brother and two
sisters to mourn his death.
Another Pioneer Gone.
We are called upon this week to
chronicle the death ot another pioneer
of Amador county, in the person of
Daniel Beem, of New York" Kanch at
the ripe old age of 85 years. He died
on the 28th of January, from the
breaking down of hid vital froces in
cident to age. The f unerai took place
Tuesday last, services being conduct
ed in the M. E. church by K. C. E.
Winning at two o'clock, alter which
the body was laid in the Protestant
cemetery by the side of his wife, who
left this life three years ago last Nov
ember. A large number of old
settlers, and the neighbors generally,
joined in the procession to the grave.
Deceased was a native of Ohio. He
oame to California in 1852, and for a
period of 51 years lived on the farm
and wayside place- at New York
Ranch. Three daughters survive him,
Mrs Wheeler, Mrs Emmons, and Mrs
Hanley. . .
Fine Lemons.
We were shown last week a fine
sample of Amador county lemons,
demonstrating the fitness of portions
of this couuty for the growth of
citrus fruits. Mrs S. Angove sent
east for the tree. She cultivated it
for a year or two iv Jackson, and
when it grew to a size beyond her
care, she sent it to Orrie W. Jones of
the Mocking Bird ranch below
Mountain Spring, where it has
thrived amazingly, and has commenc
ed to bear fruit. The specimen shown
is one of the largest lemons we have
seen, would make nearly two of the
ordinary lemons, aud ia as juicy as
the best southern product. The warm
belt in the neighborhood of Alt.
Spring is particularly adapted for
all kinds of citrus fruits. And there
are other sections of Amador equally
well suited for oranges, lemons and
olives. .

one, only the relatives of the con
tracting parties, and a few invited
friends being present. Nelson Bastian,
brother of the biide, acted as best
man, and Mrs. May Gesicke, a sister
of the bride, as bridesmaid. After
the ceremony all present repaired to
the homo of the bride's parents, Mr

in the prettiest style of the dress
maker's art. Both the church and the

the bridal tour a royal reception will
be given them. The groom is em
ployed at the Kennedy mine and is
well known in them mining circles
here, as a steady industrious' and
worthy young man.

at the north end ol Alain street a
man ran up to him, slipped the bag
in which he carried the papers off his

assault, jumped aside, and thereby
avoided the loss of the few bits in
his pocket. The assailant however,
ran off with the bag of papers, and
escaped. So far no trace of bag or rob

JACOB VAN NETTER.
California's Oldest Resident.
Jackson has the -proud distinction
of being the home of the oldest citizen
in the state. His name is Jacob
Van Natter, and he lacks less than a
month ol being 102 years ot age. He
was born in Louisville,- Lewis county,
New YorK, on February 5, 1801. He
came to California in 18G3, crossing
the plains, and has since made two
trips across the continent to visit his
native state, the last trip being in
1893, when he was .89 years of age.
The Sacramento Union of "Tuesday
last contains a sketch of this centen
arian accompained ; with a portrait
taken when 100 years of age.. He
lives with his daughter, Mrs C. Richt
myer. Three other children . are also
living, Mrs G. M. Blair also of Jack
son, Mrs H. M Manion of Sari gFran
cisco, and James C. Van Natter of
Wisconsin. r ?\
The hand of time has naturally left
its impress upon hia frame; plough
ing the furrows upon his features,
and sapping the suppleness of bygone
days from his now tottering limbs.
He is still able to get around the
house with the aid of a walking stick,
and up to within three months ago,
when he sustained a nasty tall, which
shook him up severely, was able to
get around freely without any aid
whatever.
The moat : remarkable fact about
this "grand old man," is that his
mind is clear, his memory reaching
back to scenes of childhood days as
correctly almost as to happenings of
yesterday.

"I spend my winters in Samoa," said
a traveler. "It is always summer
there. There the babies swim. Can
you imagine a quainter, a more charm
ing sight thau a host of babies, none
over two years old, laughing and
crowing and swimming like fish in
pools of clear sea water? You will see
this sight in Samoa. Sarnoan women
believe sea baths benefit babies, and
in that equable climate they bathe their
little ones daily the year around. The
youngsters soon learn to swim. They
can* swim before they can walk. And
to see these pretty brown babies swim
ming in the sea is well worth a 5,000
mile trip to Samoa."— Philadelphia Bul^
Jetin.
Extravagant Shoe*.
During the reigus of William Rufus,
Henry I. and Stephen all sorts of ex
travagant shoes wei % e worn. The toes
were -sometimes long and pointed and
sometimes made to cufl like a ram^s
horn. Occasionally they were twisted
In different directions, as though the
feet were deformed. The clergy pro
tested and threatened, but the fashion
continued in spite of the maledictions.
Several persons were excommunicated
for wearing ' pointed shoes, but they
took the risk.
Handling Facts.
The lady witness had become quite
picturesque In her testimony, and the
attorney had called her down in a way
that had made her mad all over. "Con
fine yourself to facts if you please,
madam," he said in conclusion. "Very
•well," she replied tartly. "You are no
gentleman. How does that strike you?"

The saturnalia was , a midwinter
feast of the Romans in honor of.Sat
urn, beginning on Dec. 17. On this oc
casion .great license was given to every
one to do what he pleased, and even
the slaves were permitted much liberty
of speech and action. All work was
suspended, the houses and temples
were decorated, congratulations were
exchanged and presents sent as with

AN INGENUOUS
CRITICISM
[Original.]
I was sitting in my study working on
a plan for a new novel when a servant
entered and Lauded me a card: "Miss
Gwendolin Phlpps."
I had never, heard of . Miss I>hipp3,
and I especially object to being inter
rupted by visitors, so I tried through
the servant to get rid of. her. But I
failed and finally received her.
I was ndt sorry I had done so, for the
moment she entered I saw that she
would make an excellent model for
Bessie Gifford, a character I was about
to draw. She was a petite blond and
as dainty as a canary. She came in all
blushes and smiles.
"Jlr. Pendleton, I believe— Paul Pen
dleton. Such a lovely name for an au
thor, and I notice you always select
appropriate names for your charac
ters."
"Please be seated, Miss Phipps, and
tell me what I can do for you." .
"I came to thank you," she said,
sinking iato a chair, her silk dress
dropping into graceful folds, "but first
I want you to tell me how you found
out the conditions between Wallace
and myself?" \. V
"What conditions? What Wallace?"
"Wallace Onnsby, the hero of your
last novel, 'The True Ring.' There it
Is," and she held up a glittering soli
taire on the third finger of her left
hand. "It was very nice of you to
transpose his name and call him Onns
by Wallace. But everybody knew all
the same. At least I and my best and
truest friend, Ida Goss, did. But, then,
she knew all about these troubles be
tween Wallace and me. And how you
did hit off that mean thing, Irene Tew
ney. You didn't call her by her right
name at all, but then you couldn't call
us all by our right names."
"My dear young lady, will you kindly,
tell me what yon are talking about?"
"Why, about your plot for 'The True
Ring,' of course. You haven't told me
how you got hold of it. Ida declares
she didn't tell, and of course Wallace
couldn't have done so. Did he?".. r.
She looked at me with such a pretty,
curious expression I had half a mind
to admit that Wallace had given me
the whole thing, but I feared the false
hood might lead to complications, so I
said:
"I would like you to tell mo wherein
the plot of my 'True Ring' coincides
with your own affairs."
, "Silence gives consent. I knew it
must be Wallace who told you. Of
course you had to promise him you
wouldn't say anything about it Well,
Wallace and I were lovers, just as
Onnsby and Caroline were in the book.
Then Irene Tewney, or Mabel Blake,
as you call her, wants him for herself
and interprets the family secret so as
to reflect on Caroline (me). Wallace, de
spite the convincing circumstances, has
faith in me until he applies the test,
and Caroline gives the true ring of a 1a 1
real good, noble' girl. The name Is
splendid."
Great heavens! Is this all there is
to that plot? Now I think it is about
all the machinery on which I hung a
network of subtle introspective philos
ophy which I and high grade critics
consider uniquely Pendletonian.
"You have not yet told me," I said,
"the denoument as it is in the real case
— you? case.".
"Why, just as it is in the book, of
course. You didn't change It a bit.
Wallace applied the test exactly as
Ormsby did, and I responded (blushing)
just as Caroline did."
"Has It occurred to you that your
lover read my novel and finding a
similarity in my imaginary plot to his
own and your conditions concluded to
test you as he did?"
"Well, I declare! I never thought of
that. I wonder if he did?" ;.;
"After all my character puts a gen
eral case that has occurred between,
thousands of lovers. I admit there is
an art in this in the book that would
be impossible in real life, though it is
intended to represent real life."
"Ormsby was perfectly lovely, and
Wallace was perfectly lovely too. He
didn't use the same words as Ormsby,
but they were just as noble and good
and sweet and nice." . -
I groaned.- I had read hundreds of
criticisms on my book, but this was
the first that struck me as ingenuous.
My critic wa3" one moment slapping me
in the face, the next paying me the
highest compliments, at times doing
both at once. 3 . w
"Miss Phipps," I said, "instead of
your thanking me for bringing you
and your lover together, which is all a
mistake, permit me to thank you for
this visit.- It has created a revolution
In me. Hereafter I propose to write
novels that will be enjoyed by simple,
ingenuous people. Xow, I want your
permission to use j-ou under an as
sumed name in my next novel."
"Will you?" she cried, clapping her
hands. "Will you put me in? And
Wallace?" she added timidly.
"I'll put you in. As to W'allaco, I
don't know him, so I couldn't, though
I would like to just to please you."
I chatted with her for an hour, get
ting excellent material, much of which
went into my new story just as she
spoke it. I have struggled against
small sales of my books before, my
only recompense being the approval of
a few high grade critics. When my
next book appeared I gained the more
substantial reward of dollars.
As Miss Phipps was passing out of
my study door I was off in a dream of
what I would make her do aud say in
my story and so wrapt in the imagi
nary that I forgot the real flesh and
blood. I was awakened by a pair of
arms being thrown around my neck
and a kiss. \."v
It Is ,well that I am fifty years old.

Remedies aro compounds of medicinal
principles, scientifically extracted from

which they are. rceoinmonded. They are
medicines which have enjoyed the public

"Favorite Prescription" cures female
weakness, Irregularities, exhausting

which has a record of marvelous cures.
Substitution means selfishness on the

A Ghostly Game
[Original.]
Devereux told me this story one even-
Ing when I asked him to join a poker
party of my intimate friends. I don't
expect any one to believe it, though.
Knowing Devereux as I do, I believe it
myself:
"I never gamble, and if I did gamble
it would not be with my associates.
Gambling excites the most beastlike
passion there is hi human beings—cu
pidity. I would rather play with a pro
fessional gambler than a friend, for in
the former case it becomes a transac
tion between two persons who it is un
derstood' are trying to get the better of
each other, while in the latter it is not
so understood, and yet such Is the fact
"Two years ago there were half a
dozen of us who used, to play in my
rooms. There were Tom Atherton, Billy
Sanford and myself, who were regular
attendants, and several others who
would drop In occasionally. We began
with penny ante, ten cent limit, but
the second week we raised the limit to
a 'quarter* and in ■ the third week
raised the ante to 5 cents. We only
played for enjoyment, and only three
Of us were well to do. These were Tom
Atherton, Billy Sanford and I. One
night we three and several others were
playing a little heavier game than usu
al. First one, then the other o.f these
others dropped out. Tom Atherton pro
posed that for onco we should have a
more exciting game, and we raised the
stake and the limit. It wasn't long be
fore Tom began to be a winner. I
stood about even, while Billy lost. I
soon noticed a look In Tom's face I
didn't like, the loolj of a huntsman
mercilessly running down a deer. The
more Billy lost the more covetous of
his money seemed Tom. We played all
night, or, rather, Tom and Billy did,
for toward morning I withdrew from
the game and went to sleep on a
lounge. The other two broke off just
before breakfast time and agreed to
renew .the game the same evening.
"They played all the next night and
the next day. I begged them to stop,
but they would not listen to me. Final
ly about 4 o'clock in the afternoon Bil
ly got up from the table, white as a
sheet, and went out.
"'Y6u've got everything I own,' I
heard him say to Tom, 'but I'll get
even with you. You be here at 10 to
night. I know where I can get a
stake.' .
"Of course I didn't want this thing
going on in my rooms, but what could
I do? Tom was on hand at the ap
pointed hour, but at 10 o'clock Billy
hadn't come, and I begged Tom not to
wait for him. Tom was about to com
ply when there was a ring at the tele
phone, which was in the room we occu
pied. I took down the receiver, and
Billy spoke to me.
" 'I can't come tonight, but I want
you to play for me for awhile by tele
phone.'
"I tried to beg off, but it was no use,
and to satisfy .him I agreed to play
for a little while.
"I lived In a suburban town and had
my own private wire. We carried the
card table Into another room, I took
$10 from my pocket at Billy's request
to start him, and the "game began. I
reported Billy's, hands to him, and he
told me how to bet The process was
necessarily slow, and Tom, who lost
from the first, proposed an unlimited
game, to which proposition Billy as
sented. The hands ran high, and . it
sometimes required but a single hand
to change several hundred dollars
from one player to the other. '
"It seemed to me that the cards were
bewitched. Such hands I never saw
before and never expect to see again.
Occasionally Tom would win on three
of a kind, but at thd next deal he
would hold a full hand, and Billy
would overtop him with four, or Tom
would hold four queens while Billy
would hold four kings. Not only was
the strength of the hands remarkable",
but that two large hands should come'
so often together, and In nine cases In
ten Billy held the larger hand.
"One by one the I. O. U.s Billy had
given, passed from Tom back to Billy,
6r, rather, Into my pocket for Billy's
account Then Tom's money was heap
ed up before me and lastly his I. O, U.s
filled my vest pocket but during the
two hours we played, In the last half
hour seven-tenths of Tom's fortune
passed Into Billy's possession, the other
three-tenths having been lost in the
first hour and a half. Tom asked me
to figure up his I. O. U.s, and when I
gave him the total he fell on the floor
in a dead faint. I picked him up, laid
him on the sofa and, going to the tele
phone room, called to Billy to report
that Tom was not in' condition to play
longer. I got no reply to my call. I
was very much astonished, but hadn't
time to think about-it, for I had to go
back to Tom. I got him together, but
there was a wild, hunted look on his
face that was awfully distressing.
Calling a carriage I took him home and
put him to bed. Then I went home and
went to bed myself.
"I awoke about 4 o'clock the next
afternoon. While I was dressing a
servant threw an evening paper, as
usual, into my room. I rang, for a
meal to be brought up from the restau
rant below and sat down to look over
the paper. What do you suppose was
the first thing that struck me? Big
headlines announcing that William C.
Sanford had about 5 o'clock the even

ever-changing coterie of households
which go to make up the official circle
at the American capital has included
eo many junior members as at present.
At the head of the list, of course,
stand the young people of the White
House household. Of the half dozen
young folks of the Roosevelt clan,
Theodore, Jr., who is attending Har
vard, and Kermit, the second son, who
is away at school, now spend compara
tively little time at the White House
save at holiday seasons; but Miss
Alice, the flaxen-haired Miss Ethel and
the younger boys, Archibald and Quen

for riding, driving and the other strenu
ous athletic pursuits in which their
parents take such delight. Vice-Presi
dent and Mrs. Fairbanks have a family
of sons and daughters which, though
widely scattered most of the time, is
reunited several times each season in
Washington.
During many administrations the
President's official family has been
made up of men well advanced in
years, whose households included few
young people, but in this respect the
present Cabinet is an exception, for in

.ADVISES LIMIT OF HUGS.
Woman Speaker Tells Girls How to
Keep Best Man. . . . . v,
"If a man is obliged to ' stop in'* the
midst of an ecstasy he is likely to come
back again. Whereas, if he is satecj^he
is likely to hug another girl the, n^xt
night Therefore, I say' if you would
keep your best beau limit your hugs." '
This is unqualified commendation
given by Mrs. ■ S. M. Cory, of the So
ciety for Political Study of Dr. T. S.
Hanrahan's rules for courtship.- The
doctor, rector of :the Sacred {Heart
church of West Fitchburg/ Mass., out
lined his ideas ;of the - curtailment of
tenderness in a ' sermon to . young
women. •.'•■' ,'-- 
"Lights | in the parlor,"-, he said,
"should not.be turned down too low.
Don't be stingy with the gas. The firlal
hug should be at io ' o'clock sharp.
Young men should not stay later than
this hour. ; ' ;.1 • ">•
"I thoroughly . agree," declared Mrs.
Cory, "with the io o'clock theory on
stay-at-home nights. I am a firm ,be^
liever in no chaperons, and I. think the'
young man should take his girl Out aHd
entertain i her during the , period .of
courtship if anything in that, line is to,
be" expected of him as a husband* x If .
he is content to sit about the house all
the time it is a bad sign. '■• . y
"The matter of turning the lights low
is largely dependent on how pretty the
girl is. If she answers the description
of certainly. plain, I should suggest that
a little softening of the illumination
might be a good thing.
"A mother and a father cannot too
thoroughly investigate the character, of
the man their daughter is . to marry.
And right here I should like to explod*
the ' theory that a good son makes a
good husband. I think, on the contrary,
the good son is so wrapped' up in the
virtues of 'mother* that it ' frequently
blinds him to those of his wife. ■ : , ■
"A long engagement is bound to be
bad. Warmed-over sentiment is much
like warmed-over potatoes— flat - and
tasteless. ' The fire and spirit go out of
the love-making, and there you are." , : .
Despite this opinion Mrs. Cory
laughs at Dr. Hanrahan's statement
that he cannot see what people find to
talk about when they go together for
years. !
"Love-making, which makes the lov
ers such a nuisance to others," she ex
plained, "is so all-absorbing that it sup
plies all conversational needs, as any
body who has ever been in love can tes
tify." ■ ;.■ .:.,.,
It Was Only a Counterfeit.
Jacob Riis, the sociologist, in an ad
dress to a workingmen's club, praised
generosity.
"I see a handful of children here,", he
said. "May they grow_ up generous.
May none of them grow up into such
a man as an old banker whom I know, j
"He is a millionaire banker, and he
lives in a palace, but his heart is'as hard
as steel and as cold as ice.
"One of his men completed, the other
day, his twenty-fifth year of service.
For twenty-five years this honest man
had worked for the banker faithfully.
He and his chief were both poor at the
beginning, but where, in the quarter
century, the banker has accumulated mil
lions, the faithful, middle-aged book
keeper has accumulated only a few
hundreds. His salary, you see, was only
$25 a week. :; ; c
' "He didn't think the banker would re
member the twenty-fifth anniversary of
his . engagement, but the old man did.
That morning he handed the bookkeeper
a sealed envelope.
"'George,' he said, 'to-day ends the
twenty-fifth year of your work for me,
and you have worked steadily and well.
In this envelop Is a memento of the
occasion.'
"The bookkeeper opened the envelope,
trembling and eager. Within lay his em
ployer's photograph. That was all. ' .
"In the face of a disappointment so
bitter the poor fellow could say nothing.
"'Well,' asked the. banker, 'what do
you think of it?
"'lt's just like you,'" said the book
keeper simply.
JACKSON, • AM ADOR COUNTY, CAL., FEB. 2, 1906;
SPAIN'S KING TO WED.
THE . YOUTHFUL PRINCESS OF
ENGLAND IS TO' BECOME THE
?i SPANISH QUEEN. ,
She is the Niece of this Country's Re
cent Guest, Prince Louis of. Batten*
berg — Princess . Ena the Royal
Beauty of England. ■ : .- ;
All eyes will be turned toward Spain
next. May when the young King Al
fonso XIII. will take the most beauti
ful and popular princess of England to
be his queen. :• • . . : t
The young girl who has at last been
selected to share the throne with Al
fonso is the Princess Ena of Batten
berg/ only daughter of Princess Henry,
the youngest sister of King. Edward.
• Ever since Alfonso became King of
Spain, . and even when his mother
acted as Queen Regent, his picturesque
personality has been the talk .of "two
continents. - Long | before ; he '• reached,
the marriageable age, even for a king,
a new bride, was picked out for him
every day, and to members of his suite
he would often say:- \, " . " . .
"Whom aim I to marry to-day? The
newspapers surely have found me an
other wife!" .: -■: ,',
' But I now that • question ; no longer
agitates Alfonso's court, for the beau
tiful : Princess ; Ena - has been chosen
after a search which , led the young
monarch all over Europe. Country af
ter country was visited, but the'fas
tidious young king was often con
fronted by more fastidious young prin
cesses, and after he had been out on
bis search for a while he found that
royal princesses were not so anxious
to become Queen of Spain as he had
thought back in his luxurious palace.
When Alfonso visited England a few
months ago there were dozens of young
noblewomen paraded' for his . inspec
tion, but his eyes 'flew to the young
Princess Ena, and Alfonso, the unim-
MISS OLGA NETHERSOLE.
This English Actress Would Refuse Divorce to Couples
Who Have Children. \
Miss Olga Nethersole, the distin
guished English actress who is now
producing in this country a new so
ciety drama, "The Labyrinth," speaks
with intense conviction against di
vorces to families in which children
have been born to the marriage. When
the production of the play was first
broached to Miss Nethersole she was
'more than willing to produce it
not alone for the excellent opportuni
ties afforded her for dramatic inspira
tion, but she found that it had a seri
ous purpose. in teaching humanity an
object lesson. In fact most of the
pltys which Miss Nethersole has pro
duced have hidden somewhere lessons
to be taught the founders of homes.
"Hervieu," she said in. an interview,
"has shown in his drama, 'The Laby
rinth,' the indissolvable bond the child
makes between husband and wife and'
'the terrible, consequences of a disrup
tion of such a union. - ' •
What does ■ marriage mean," she
i asked, "if not parentage? The rela
tionship 'and responsibilities, not of
husband and wife, but of father and
mother, are those which should be ac
cepted when a man and woman are
joined in marriage. To tear apart by
law the tie which binds a couple to
gether, after they have brought . chil
dren into the world, is to destroy the
home and to rob those children of all
the influences which develop them into
good citizens. ' Divorce is an injustice
to the offspring of marriage; it places
a barrier between them and one of
their parents — oftentimes ' both; it
warps their development; it embitters
their souls. No such deseoration of
pressionable, was conquered. .:"/•;.■' j
Few monarchs have had the mete
oric career of /this young King of
Spain, and if. the Princess who is to
become his . consort follows out '■ the
rules which have always governed her
happy young life Alfonso will have at
last found someone to keep him in the
way l he should go— an achievement
which has never : heretofore been ac
complished.':' j ' :'..;' ■■...
He has frequently ridden out of the
palace disguised as a soldier, a 'guard
or even a peasant, and has gone for
miles horseback riding or to attend
some little fete which has come to his
notice. Days have : elapsed t during
which the queen mother and the entire
court have searched high and low for
the boy king without avail, but before
the incident could be made public the
young monarch would, come riding
•back the way he had gone, happier, for
his boyish prank and checking remon
strance with the assurance that "I am
the king.".. . ' ;  ;.■ ■/■ • .
The Princess Ena is regarded as the
beauty of the royal household. She is
but eighteen years old, ankl is the
only girl in the - family.' . Her three
brothers ' adore her and are constantly
giving her a "ripping" good time. Her
elder brother, Prince Alexander, was
recently in this country as a "middy"
with the fleet of Prince Louis of Bat
tenberg, his uncle. 1 V '. ; . . :.;;
\ This charming young woman made
her ' debut last : February at Bucking
ham Palace and created a furore. . She
Is the favorite godchild and likely to
become the principal . heiress of Em
press Eugenic. •
Princess Ena is an enthusiastic sail
or and motorist, and . is ■ the constant
companion of her mother on numerous
little trips In their yacht and through
the beautiful country for^which their
home, the Isle of Wight, is noted. She
is especially gifted with dramatic abil
ity, and in a recent amateur : produc
tion given in' Kensington Palace she
played the part of a vivandiere with
marked success.' She sings and dances
exceptionally well. \
the home should be permitted by law."
"But what of the many cases in which
repeated cruelty makes it impossible
for a wife to live with her husband?"
was asked.
"Such domestic tragedies occur, it is
true, and occur with, sad frequency,"
Miss Nethersole ■ replied. : "But even
then there should be no absolute dis
ruption of the marriage tie. Separa
tion solves the question. Let them
live apart, although still married, and
perhaps a reconciliation will take place,
and happiness come out of misery, in
the end. Then the children will still
have a ■ father and mother, although
they may spend most of the time with
one of their parents. There will -at
least be no possibilities of placing
them under the care of another mother
or another father, by a second mar
riage. A spiritual nucleus, about which
the home again might unite, would still
exist. ..." . . { . ■ "
•Uniformity is the first step that is
needed in the formation of the divorce
laws of the United States. There are
different codes in almost every, State,
and one may. be a criminal in one and
not in another. Then the divorces are
easily granted on too many .grounds.
In England there are three causes for
which divorce may be secured — infidel
ity, cruelty and desertion. In this
c6untry there seem to be half a dozen
or more, but America is ahead of
France at least in one respect. There
people who may have been divorced
jnlay not remarry each other. Such a
law is a sin, for in the reunion of the
!pair lies the only hope for the salva
tion of the home."

i By .request the American Lumber

the speech of _George H. Maxwell,, ex
ecutive chairman I ' of the National Irri
gation > Association, delivered before
the American Forest Congress at Wash
ington, D. C, in the early part of Jan
uary, 1905. -This address has much
to commend it to the business • men
of ' the country. It was termed the
sensational address of . the congress,
and ' perhaps deservedly so called be
cause it - seta forth in illuminated
words the necessity of inaugurating a
systematic movement j looking toward
the rehabilitation of forest lands and
the planting or treeless areas. ' .
•] The . gentleman ' who .. delivered this
able ; talk on [ forestry j spoke/ from j ex
perience and. close observation. He did
not dillydally . around -with '. the I usual .
commonplace platitudes about the im
portance of forestry, 'but- by illustra
tion -showed . for.-what :. purposes: the
forests were inten ded and ' the com
mercial | value of their importance as
compared with the recognized bulwarks
of the nation. "While he conceded the
necessity ;of an "arnry and , : navy jto
guard invasion and to protect and up
hold ' the rights of the people . in ' for
eign countries he called particular at
tention to the desirability of maintain
ing an adequate forested area in order
that the commercial interests of the
United States ■ might ' in . like j manner
be preserved. ■ •', ■ ■' > .V ; . ' ■■,
. Mr. Maxwell's' arraignment of the
national lawmakers and his comments
'on ' the : shortsightedness .of those in
charge of business interests were time
ly.'.!-While not subscribing J fully and
unreservedly to the views expressed
the American Lumberman believes that
his severe condemnation of past and
present methods and practices will
bring forth' good results and that . ita
republlcation will again turn public
attention to the necessity of adopting
laws which will correct evils in the
future and provide a system of a juster
administration of the public land laws.
The attitude of the public . toward
forestry i and irrigation is a peculiar
one. " Men evidently, fail to recognize
any personal ; interests , in , such ; ques
tions. Some are i totally , indifferent;
others admit the desirability of es
tablishing reserves but want to leave
it to those ." who- are ■. more directly
concerned. Still others are lukewarm
and, while readily admitting the bene
fits, of forestry and ■ irrigation pro
jects, content themselves with waiting
until there is more visible likelihood
of the movement 'being: successful.
Still another faction is made ; up. of
those who are' openly; opposed ■ to all
forestry schemes, many • national irri
gation projects, and government inter
vention in such matters, i .'••, ■' : .'t :

preponderance of the country covered
with forests had. deluded the people
into a belief that they were of minor
importance as forests and of primary
mportan.ce as -manufacturing materials.
The result has been that . under pri

largely have disappeared and at the
present time little if any attention
is being given to providing for a sec

FORESTS SHOULD BE PROTECTED.
An Address Before the American
Forest Congress.
In the American Lumberman's ex
naustive report of the proceedings of
the American Forest Congress, held In
Waehnigton, D. C, in January last,
in the installment presented March 24
was given the address of George H.
Maxwell, executive chairman of the
National Irrigation Association. In
view of the early meeting of
congress Mr. Maxwell's recommen
dations, which follow, are timely and
valuable.
I think the mistake we make today
and always have made is in looking
upon this question of forestry as in
any sense a sectional question. It U
necessarily as much a national ques
tion as is the maintenance of an army
or the construction of a navy. (Ap
plause.)
I wish I had the power by some"
telepathic process of impressing upon
the mind of every man present the
picture that is in my own mind as I
stand here.
I crossed the Mississippi river on my
way to the west a little over two years
ago on a ferryboat on which was
loaded a train of overland passenger
cars; and as we crossed that great
river opposite the city of New Orleans,
during one of the greatest floods in
years, the water was almost up to the
tops of the levees on both sides of the
river. It was a serious question
whether the city of New Orleans was
not in danger; and as we landed on
the west side of the river we looked
down over the bank and saw the plan
tations away down below the level of
the water and exposed to overflow and
destruction any moment that aA-tiJIcial
barrier might break. Before we had
gone twenty-four hours farther west .
the levee did break and one of those
great crevasses was formed and It
practically destroyed the <ji*P for that
season over a large area other
localities and the city of New Orleans
were saved by the diminished pressure
of the flood on the adjacent levees.
(Continued on next page,)I could not help, thinking to 'jhyself
whether it might not be possible some
aay or other to awaken the people of
the Mississippi valley to a realization
ct the fact that forestry is a problem
extending from New Orleans to the con
tinental divide of the Rocky mountains
on the west, to Canada on the north
and to the crest of the Alleghanies on
the east, where the Ohio river has its
•ource; and that failure and destruc
tion are inevitable if it shall be ex
pected in the years to come to control
that great flood by increasing the
levees to protect the sugarbowl of the
nation. The time will come when they
cannot build them higher and the
country will revert to a swamp condi
tion and be as desolate as it is today
where the St. Francis basin is covered
with water : through which you may
look down and see the tops of trees
that once grew on dry land. How are
you going to prevent that?
This great problem of forestry, Is
not alone a matter of sentiment. It
ts Just as much a cold blooded ques
tion of -business. The speakers who
preceded me have spoken upon the im
portuuee: of - forestry to mining. I
have listened with much ' Interest to
their masterly discussion on the rela
tion of forestry to mining, and It
brought more forcibly than ever to my
mind the conviction that the whole
country and those engaged In all its
Industries are fast coming to recog
«Jze the importance lot forestry. I
regret that- we cannot include the
lower house; ot congress. They do not

dent's address yesterday ana one of
bis'sentences struck, me Very forcibly.
He said: "We "want to -change the
hope of accomplishment to thb knowl
edge of things done." It we are go
ing to do that we must have a clear
cut idea.of what Ye lire going to do
and of what we want -Congress to do
—so plain and dear that there Is no
possibility of Any man being bo atupid
that he cannot understand it. -
We have listened to these gentlemen
here today telling of the necessities of
the, mining industries and of the injus
tice .brought about by Insufficient
laws. There Is a most simple way to
get all the things tlone that they have
recommended, and more, too. The first
Is-to come to a perfect understanding
with a business bureau of the govern
ment, if we can create such a bureau,
and the. way to do that is to pass the
bill consolidating the forest reserves
under the control Of Gin"ord Pinchot.
(Applause.) And after you have done
that and he has consulted with- the
lumberman and the miner and the far
mer and understands What they want,
then back him up and make your con
gressman help to get it done.
' - A'Case of Masterly'inactivity. *
Let us look at the business end of
that proposition. Other things be>
' sides bees have business ends. For a
. number of years the president of the
United States, the secretary of the in
terior and the .commissioner of the
general land office have been trying to
impress upon congress, without suc
cess, the necessity of repealing the
timber and stone act. I want to give
. the exact facts. The president, in De
cember, 1902, more than two years
ago, called the attention of congress in
the strongest possible language to the
necessity of doing something to stop
•the frauds ahd depredations upon the
public domain under the timber and
stone act. The secretary said in his
annual report more than L two years
ago: . ■ • - ■■ '< ■- ■.■•-.•■
"The timber and stone act "will, if
not repealed or radically amended, re
sult ultimately in the complete de
struction of the timber on the unap
propriated and unreserved public
lands." .
I find these words in the report of
the senate committee on tlie public
lands, and the date is February 19,
1903: ... • ,-. : • . ' ■■>-... -
"It can be plainly seen that all the
valuable timber lands of the United
States- will be owned by '^peculators
•within three years if the opportunity
to acquire them at $2.50 an acre is
continued." . -, ■
, That was February 19, 1903. It Is
now pretty close to February 19, 190EJ,
and one year from that date the three
■ years will -be exhausted and all the
timber land will be gone according to
this official statement.
Has the bill been repealed?. No!
Has the house Of representatives
done anything to stop . this shameful
waste of the public, property under the
timber and stone act? No!
They have- done nothing whatever to
■top the abuses and' frauds constantly
lining committed under that act.
■ President Sees the Necessity. .
Again v the following year the presi
dent in his' message to congress mad«
substantially the same recommenda
tions. They were reiterated by tne
secretary of the interior. The senate
committee on public lands recom
. mended a bill-to repeal 'the limber and
eior.c act n;; J the seruuu passed me
bill in the last session of congress. It
■went to the public lands committee of
the house of representatives. ..' T. is.
Walker appeared before that commit
tee and waved his magic wand an!
they gave two votes for the repest if
the bill out of eighteen members of
the committee. Two votes! And the
.1/111 is lying there in that committee
yet. ■■/•■•
In this cession of "congress -without
waiting fcr anything, or for anybody
to do anything, they passed n resolu
tion in the public lands committee of
the house continning this whole sub
ject over' until the, next session of
congress. .' '. . - ■

having'the value of the stumpage from
'that' 3,»0n,000 acres of timber In.the
■ «mtlonal treasury wo have parted with
the -timber and the land and the young
growth and everything lor $2.50 an
acre. Taking the value of that timber
at what the stumpage actually sold for
upon some of the government land in
Minnesota, $15.06 an acre, the govern
ment has lost $40,000,000 by that pro
ceeding. . But' the" stumpage on the 3,
000,000 acres located during 'the last
two years was much more . valuable
than that. And if the' government had
managed its timber land business as
any business man or any man ', of
sense would' have .managed it we
might Just as well as -not have realized
$70,000,000 from, that stumpage and
have. had our young forest trees plant
ed in southern California and 'the sur
plus left over. (Applause.) ;« :-^
'- A Few Suppositions. .'-.*>■'•
We are told that there is going to be
a deficit this year in the treasury of
the ■ United States of $22,000,000. If
we had not thrown away that $70,000,
000 we could nave covered that deficit
at least twice over and still have had
money left li\ the treasury. In other
words the public lands committea of
the house has thrown away -over
$70,000,000 'of the . people's • money in
the last two years. If we should put
this total loss at only $50,000,000 for
the two years It has amounted to over
$2,000,000 a month oV about $70,000 a
day. ■ . . i ■•
■ Now • suppose some enterprising and
ingenious person had succeeded in
tunneling under the IJnited States
treasury and cut 'ft hole Into the vaults
and carried "off <$70,000 a day. Don't
yon suppose we could get the people
of the United States to wake up the
public lands committee If It required
some action by it to stop that steal
ing? That is exactly what is going
on; for if the house public lands com
mittee does nothing in this session of
congress (and it has already voted to
do nothing) the loss to this country
of $70,000 it -day—-35,000.000 a month-*
$25,000,000 a year, and it is much, more
than that —will go right along : -ana
continue until* all the timber land of
the government has been Stolen. That,
will be ft littla over a year, according
to the report of the senate public
lands committee. . Xnd after the land
is all gone —after the horse has been
stolen—the house public lands com
mittee will awaken from its Rip Van
winkle slumbers and close the stable
iH>or "with a bang.
TSome Things to Do.
Before I close 1 wish to specify
some definite and speciuo things which
should be done; - \s
- First—Repeal the timber and stone
act.
Second —Pass the consolidation bill
putting the government forests under
The management of the bureau of .for
estry, s-. • - • I ,■
: Third—Provide, by national' legisla
tion that every acre of agricultural
land that can be reclaimed' under the
national irrigation system must bo
saved for the homemaker who will go
there and make a home upon It. , I
--In that way you can break up the
timber combinations, and in that way
only; because the land thieves of
North Dakota, under the commutation
clause; the land thieves of Montana,
under the desert land act; the land
thieves under'the timber and stone act
in —well, perhaps I might be permitted
to mention Oregon (laughter) -. are
working together. You will Save to
explode, some of those Japanese shells
amon* them Ho break up the combi
nation.
To show you why we cannot depend
upon congressmen from the timber
states of the west to correct this enor
mous evil,. a year ago both Oregon
senators and both representatives
from Oregon were bitterly opposed to
any change in the land laws. Repre
sentatives Hermann and Williamson
both went before the committee and
protested-against any -change. ' Mr.
Hermann was before the committee.
At that exact moment the Oregon
grand jury was in session in the city
of Portland,. composed of men drawn
by lot from all over the state, and that
grand Jury urged the repeal of all
those laws —the timber and stone act,
the desert land act and the commuta
tion clause —and sent a memorial to
the public lands committee to that ef
fect Now the grand Jury has had
some business with' Mr. Hermann since
that.time. (Laughter and applause.)
In all those western states the state
has ■ the power >. to form districts for
local public improvements, such as ir
rigation districts, sanitary districts,
drainage, districts or levee .districts,
and I for one do not believe that that
is the right'policy that the national
government .'should assum'6 the burden
of protecting' from fire 'forests now
owned* by men who hafe'gotten them
from the. government'fpr one-tenth of
their value.  The state -'and nation
should co-operate to' form forestry
districts, and, have assessments -levied
on all private lands in the district, and
every acre should, contribute its pro
portion to the.'cost of preserving" it
from fire. (Applause.)
There is one more, thing that I was
going to urge as a mere matter of per
sonal opinion. In making the sugges
tion I Uo not speak for California cr
for "the National Irrigation Associa
tion, but, for myself alone. I have
Leen ail my life a republican and in
my earlier years advocated the repub
lican doctrine of a tariff for protection
in many political campaigns in my na
tive rtate of California iro:rj the Or
egon line to llcnico; but'because I be
lieve in preserving our industries anj
not in destroying them I believe that
in order to preserve the forest indus
tries of, this nation we should repeal
every'tarift law imposing a tariff upen
the products of the forest, "whether
timber or wood or wood pulp, at any
rato'tor a limited number of years and
until we shall have planted ! forests
enough to • harvest annually frem oui
own forests all the vwood and timber
we may use In any one year.
There are a number of other things
tliat I have in try mind to -suggest
that ought to bo clone: '
I'ass the Appalachian D'.:i.
One is to pass the Appalachian for
estry bill, which Is ready -to be passed
■ Another is to stop now and for all
time all exchange of lands in forest
reserves for otrtej.- lands. If the gov
ernment needs any such land let it buy
them and pay for them their fair value
and np more. All lieu land scrip
phonld Tie ca!lo<l in nnd canceled and
no more ever issued under any circum
stances. Tho x forest lieu land • ex
change law should repealed.
The' bill providing for- the consolida
tion of the government forestry inter
ests is ready to bo passed by . the
senate and should be passed in this
session of congress. It has nlread}
passed 'the house,; nnd if this sesslor.

NEW PUBLIC PRINTER.
AT THIRTY-FOUR TEARS OF AGE
HE HEADS THE BIGGEST PRINT
SHOP IN THB WORLD.
His Office Pays Out Annually Over
Four and a Half Million Dollars In
Wages— ls One of the President's
.Youngest. ■
At the head of the biggest printing
office in the world at the age of 34.
That is the position in which Charles
A. Stillings finds himself to-day. When
the Hon. Frank W. Palmer resigned
from the office of Public Printer last
summer, - President Roosevelt found
himself facing the necessity of making
one of the most important appoint
ments that had, ever fallen to his lot
to consider. The printing required for
the -United States Government is so
voluminous and of such diversified de
tail that it is necessary to operate the
enormous plant in which the printing
Is produced, in the most perfect way.
At the head of this great printery the
President knew he must place a man
who would •he manly -among men,
strong of character, quick Of decision
and with fc thorough grasp of every
detail ot the printing business in
everyone of its many branches. Many
men backed by strong -political influ
ence were presented to the President
for his consideration in making the
appointment for Public Printer, hut
none seemed to be possessed of all of
the necessary qualifications, until his
attention- was directed to a progres
sive young man whose knowledge of
the printing business covered the en
tire field and who had had practical
experience hi Boston, Philadelphia and
Washington — one Charles A. Stillings.
And so, after a thorough examination
into Mr. Stillings' commercial career,
the President, finding that Mr. Stfl
llngs' ability was just what he had
been looking for, appointed him as the
executive head of the Government
Printing Office. The Senate promptly
confirmed the President's appointment
and bo Mr. mailings has become the
active head of the establishment
A hrief "idea 'ot the volume of busi
ness iohdiictea by the Government
Printing Office may,. be obtained from
the following figures. Last year they
paid in wages'to its various employees
the sum of 14,616,781.70 and nearly
three millions more were 'spent lor
various 'supplies, including taper, iiew
machinery tind maintenance of the
plant Every dollar of this *gmfstim
is 'under the oheck of the
Public Printer and 'it is evident that
much "Wisdom is needed in handling
money Wliefe so largo an "amount 'is in
volved. . •
Mr. "Stillings is especially fitted by
training, inclination, a»d ability for
the position. He forms an attractive
addition to the ranks 'of Che young 'men
with whom President Roosevelt has

surrounded ■ himself in the administra
tion of the Government affairs. He re
ceived his education in the Phillips
Grammar School and the English iHigh
School at Boston. After leaving school
he entered hi 3 father's printing >offlco,
where he receive--! a varied and thor
ough experience in all branches of the
trade, finally vorliing up to tho posi
tion cf fjenernl manager and later be
coming E2IC3 nisnaser of the GrifSth
3tiliin?3 v Press, an organization which
took over tho business formerly con
ducted ty I.lr. Sailings, Sr. \
• In all of Mr. Stillings' transactions
he has shoivn an unusual aptitude for
organization, and, possessing a marked
degreo of personal magnetism has
drawn into a closa friendship with
himself many men of dignity and posi
tion. Mr. Stillings is a Mason, having
attained the honors of the thirty-sec
ond degree of the Scottish, Rite, and is
clso a Mystic Shriner. ; .
that would make him feel the full
weight of an outraged national public
sentiment. ■ (Applause.) They are not
liable to punishment criminally, but
they are morally responsible for every
fraud committed under the timber and
r.tone act since they shelved the bill to
repeal it passed by the senate in .the
last session or congress.
But it is not enough merely to re
peal tho timber and stone act. Every
acre of public' forest lands or brush
or woodlands which conserves a water
suppl;- should be at once embraced In
permanent forest reserves, the title to
be always retained by the national
government and the stumpage of ma
tured timber only to be sold.
Wonderful Pos-lblltfle* of the Arid
Region.
Tho whole great plains region
should bo studied and developed as a
vast area, which can be transformed
from a semi-arid region to one of
great fertility and more humid climate
by the planting of immense areas,
hundreds of thousands of acres, of
Revolutionary Russia.
Like the Stuarts of Great Britain
and the Bourbons of France, the
reigning dynasty of Russia goes from
blunder to blunder. Such a revolution
as is in : progress throughout Euro
pean Russia cannot be suppressed by
the sword. The thing to have done
was to make concessions to the spirit
of liberty when the agitation began.

break out at some other pomt — In Po

the Jump, and its loyalty put to the su

the revolution will braak out afresh in

will be a republic; not a free republic,

middle of the seventeenth century, Just
as France was at the close of the eight

Couldn't Milk the Bicycle.
years ago, soon jtfter bicycles
be^ttn to T>e freely used throughout the
United States, an agent for a New York
house turned up at a village ih Central
N«w. York.. He expatiated to an old
farmer upon the virtues of the new ma
chine, -dwelling tQ>on "what a 'time-saveif"
it >as, and withal how fashionable it
would be for the old farmer to he able
to ride down' to the village on one of
the new-fangled machines whenever be
wanted to.
"Why." said the salesman, "whenever
you go to the postoffice, tank, or store,
everybody will stop and stare at Fanner
Wilson, and pretty soon: you'll be the
most-talked-of man in the whole coun
ty." > ;/
"That may be so," replied the farmer,
"but I tell you I'm a-needin' a good
new cow mo'n I am one o' them things
you're a-talkin' about" ' . - >
Nevertheless, the agent extracted -a
promise that the old matt would save
up his money and purchase a bicycle
when the agent came around in the falL
According to promise, the agent was
on hand in the fall with the wheel. The
farmer took him in charge and carried
him out to the lot and showed him a
fine Jersey cow.
'That's what I bought with the money
I saved up for. you," said • the farmer.
And without waiting for the agent to
recover from his surprise he went on:
"I 'lowed that I needed the cow mo'n I
did the bicycle, an' l there she is. Ain't
she a beaut?"
When the agent, recovered his breath
he said: "You'll look funny riding that
cow to town, won't you?"
"Ya'as," drawled out the old farmer,
but I'd look a darned sight funnier
tryin to milk a bicycle."

¦THE COURTSHIP OF WESLEY
As Wesley plodded down the main

jreen fields where straight rows/ of to

rutting. __There_was deeper guilt in his

ght The scent of her gauzy handker
lief played about his senses for a week
fterward;. it was different from any
:rfume that had entered his nostrils,
:fore . acccustomed to the odors of
sweet basil," marjoram, and a gen
ius sprinkling of musk in the closely
icked little chapel of Sunday mornings.
Propinquity, that Strong promoter of
ie tender passions sealed his doom,
>r the school teacher boarded in his
.vn house and came to bear upon him
1 the varied and wonderful charms of
woman. „ • .
He felt himself the most highly £av
red man in the universe to be able to
ire under the same roof with her, and
» keep the little box behind the sheet
on, stove filled with wood sawed and
)lit to a nicety, to handle a refractory
oy behind the school house as an ex
nple to all others who should dare to
sfy the teacher's authority, and a hun
red other offices that a big, strong man
in perform for a young and fragile
[ember of his household, that brought
im unspeakable joy.
So far, however, from believing these

h half of his muscular power to re
ce a deficiency that he feared would
an insurmountable barrier between
i and the youtig school marm.
It -was a common enougrh failing In
neighborhood in which Wesley liv?'l,
I six months before, iht fact that /c
Id not write his owrn name, would
have embarrassed liim a great de.il.
cc the school teacher had come into
life, however, it had. become a real
rn'in the flesh. V>b!y he straggled
h the little imps of the alphabet in
room by candle light when nil the
er members of the household w?t-e
'.pped in slumber; but the go?l of his
bition measured a distance that xras
ond the feverish impd^encs ihaf-pos
sed him. f
Vesley had been tremblins: f.i the
ge of a proposal many times and
-ild have committed himself lon^ ago
for this barrier. For the idea of
Iressirg the school teacher in writing
mcd to haye fixed itself in his mind
being the only method of procedure
ongh; which he could hope for a rs
rocation. So it was an overwhelming
ire to settle his fnte, coupled with a
>e!essness of attaining the educational
ilification of bei-.p; able to his
n epistle. th=t led him to procure the
ncy of mother parry, :">on which
md he was bo'ind this afternoon,
'he party he had decided to utilize
; one Silas Msmsur, postmaster and
eral combined; and as
is was undT oblt^aticn to him for
mall loan, Wesley thouglit he mitrht
Hsd to h?ve it cinceled in this way.

Lulie Wells Smith
Silas was seated oa a high chair behind
the counter regaling ' himself with the
latest postal card news that had come in.
"Howdy, Wes'," he greeted, reluctant
ly placing the cards in their respective
pigeon holes as the visitor came behind
the counter, "Air ye through cuttin' ?"
"Well, I-I ain't clean through," was
the embarrassed answer— "but. I lef off
for a little spell, as I got a matter I
want fixed up, an' I thought this would
be the bes' time of day to ketch you—"
"Well, ef it's that little loan, I
reck'n— " _„.: ,-": ." ■**£& -• '
- ft No, I ain't after pesterin' you Tbout
that, Si," Wesley interrupted, to the
other's relief, and tattooing awkwardly
onthe desk, he blurted out: • ■ •
"Si, I've come down here to git you
to do sump'n I can't do myself, an' that's
to write a letter fen nel"
■ "Oh, that's it, is it T Silas asked, with
a grin, noticing the other's embarrass
ment "Well, I reck'n I kin 'coramodate
you," he added, taking his per* from be
hind, hig ear. "Who's the lady?" eye
ing Wesley suspiciously.
"I reck'n you know," -was the answer,
with a responsive grin to hide his em
barrassed flush.' /
Then as Silas began to drawl the
school teacher's name, writing it at the
same time with many flourishes at the
top of the sheet he had spread before
him, Wesley grinned broader, and con
fessed with more blushes that that was
the young lady in question.
"Now about the beginning?" -was Si's
next question with his most professional
air, making ready to start "You kin
make it a little stronger by adding some
words on the next lme." Silas indi
cated with his pen the line below the one
upoa which the lady's name was in
scribed, for the benefit of the uninitiated.
Wesley— "but that's accordin' to your in
tentions to the young lady." He paused
for Wesley to intimate. ,
"Then you might make it a little
stronger," the other suggested sheepishly
after a pause.
"To the young lady that has 'my
heart, how is that?" Silas poised bis pen
inquiringly. -•';..
Wesley nodded approvingly. "That's
it;" he said, and as Silas ■waited for
further _ instructions he squirmed awk
wardly in his seat and began to wipe the
persptrarion off his face.
"It's kinder hard to know what to say
when jou ain't exactJv certain 'bout the
young lady's feelin's," he stammered,
"but I like that bejjinnin' an' I reck'n
you kin p:;t it mrre fancy like ; bnt I
want you to he sure to say I'm •waitin*
for hpr answer very patient, an ef she'll I

breath, "only as I'm partic'lar 'bout
fol.es si^rin' other folk's name, suppose
yo:t jes say good-bye, my angel, till I
hear from you, an' that'll do." ■ '
It seemed sn age before Wesley had
converted all this in a s.ure enough let
ter, even taking into consideration the
beautiful flourishes with which it was
embellished, md he had it in his coat
pocket on his way to deliver into the
lianr's of the school teacher. Then it
seemed r.rsother age after he had in
trv.fted it to the care of one of the
school children and watched through the
open window to be sure it was laid on
tl-e te-'clier's desk, before school was let
out. though at last when he saw the
children pouring out the door, the pret
ty school m?rm bringing up the rear, a
real stage fright possessed him.
4 'Thf. idea of flisrr-t presented itself, but
re dismissed it with a manly determina
tion to stand his ground. When the
teacher eyas up by him. he could not
look her in the face, but began to walk*
at her side, forgetting to offer to "take
her books as usual, until they had gone
some distance and he made an awkward
attempt to, relieve her, dropping half
of them on the ground in his confusion.
• As he stopped to gather them up the
fateful letter rolled out from between
the pages of one of the books, and
there was nothing for him to do but to
pick it up and hand it to her. . A
shamed, side-long glance' at her face
told him that his doom was to be set
tled* t He walked along, -waiting for the
verdict like a hero. .
"Did yoa tell Jack Crawford to put
that letter on my desk?" the school
teacher asked, at last
JTes, Miss Elmira," was all he could
say."
Then I presume that you want my
answer?" was the next question deliv
ered in a suppressed tone.
"I-I— come here to git it," Wesley
stammered.
Then I'll give it to you now, and
its just aol" she said bhmtry, not
slackening her pace and looking straight
ahead of her.
It came like a thunderbolt, even though
he was in a measure prepared.
"Miss Elmira, I'm sorry, 'but—'?
"I hate Silas Mansur, and he had no
business writing that letter," she in
terrupted.
Wesley ( lung his head, his face
flushed to the roots of his hair. • -i
"I didn't know you'd be able to tell
by the writin', 'deed I dida't; I reck'n
it warn't actin' square, but Silas kin
write an—"
"I don't care if he can write," she in-!
ternrpted again. "Do you suppose IW
going to marry a man just because he
can write; and after all, I'd rather mar-,
ry the man I loved if he couldn't write;
his own name than one I don't care a
straw about, even if you are so anxious j
to make the match for Silas Mansur.
and I thought you'd be the last one to-^-"
She broke off with a sob, turning to
dash away the tears that sprang to her
eyes.
Wesley felt the earth slipping under
his feet, the sky seemed a dazzling,
crimson vortex whirling above him
through the dark tree tops.
"Miss Elmira 1" he cried at last, "did
you think that was Silas's own letter?
for it warn't, 'deed it warn't 1" he pant
ed. . It was my letter, Miss Elmira,
every word of it, only I got Silas to
write it fer me, 'cause — 'cause, — well, I
ain't shamed fer you to know now, I
can't write my own name." '.;;' '^;<:v
Wild Geese Killed ia Flight
The southern migration of wild fowl
this. winter was unusually late and re
sulted in many disasters. The -wild
geese ,are reported from the northwest
to have been especially severe sufferers.
The large black-headed goose is s
strong, hardy bird, generally remaining
on its own native water until the ice
forms firmly. In the South it is only
a visitor for the winter months. Born
on some lake beyond the northern wa
tershed, or perhaps on some inlet in
Hudson Bay or the Arctic Ocean/ its
heart is ever loyal to the land of its
birth. '.
Sometimes, when the cold weather
sets in late up North, as in all proba
bility it has this year, the wild geese
suffer from their devotion to their na
tive place. They may at this late season
fly right . into a streak of real winter,
with driving snow to blind. their vision
and bitter frost to halt their flight.
If there is storm, their way leads
right through it, until the leader's eyes
are closed by the freezing' of the snow
<about its head or its feathers become
too heavy weighted. When the sight
has gone and the birds are wearied, it
is easy to see how misleading is much
of the talk about the leadings of an
extra sense. " Like a ship without a
rudder, the V-shaped flock will make
for any low places. _ - .... .-■
Once a flock came tumbling into the
street of an Eastern township's village,
where the half-blinded things became
the easy prey of the boys and the dogs.
In another place a fanner chanced
one spring to find the frozen carcasses
of more than thirty fine geese in a drift
in one of the fence corners. The birds
had evidently come to earth in some
blinding storm, and, imagining they
were nearing water, found instead the
hard, sftow-covered ground, v_- ;
There are several instances recorded
of flocks of ffeese in a storm running
full tilt into the ends or sides of farm
buildings. .A large brood flew at full
speed against the rigging of the whal
ing steamer Dart this month off the
Newfoundland coast. A damp, snow
laden wind was - blowing at the time,
and eleven dead pr dying geese flut
tered on to the deck, the others alight
ing in a half-dead condition upon the
waves.
A more pleasing story is of domestic
geese in a large, well-appointed farm
yard hailing with their hearty honks,'
a short time ago, a passing drove of
twenty-two black bills. The" strangers
came down and followed their tame re
lations into the stable, where they have
since stayed.
Re-Using Old Shoes.
Janitors collect the shoes cast away
by tenants and send them to auction
rooms, where they are sorted into piles
mrrked "Men," "Women," "Children."
In a recent sale in one of the biff
cities, says the "Shoe Retailer," several
poor people made fair bids, but the
niictionccr did not Seem eager to -sell.
I'inally, a. red-faced man pushed his
way through the crowd and offered 10
cents rpicce fcr the /whole lot Kis bid
was successful. ;
"I was killing time with talk waiting
for that l fellow," said the auctioneer!
afterward. "lie always pays liigh for
these shoes and I.c does not Want them'
for wearing, either. He wants to beat
them out for the leather in them Re*
ftf ts hat mate »al there is, puts It.
through a process and makes stamped
trames, bags, pocketbooks, penknife
holders and even chair backs and seats.
He finds a ready sale for these novel
tie^ and gets a good price for them."

ing ties and laying rails. The work
demands that she be a skillful man
ager of men> She knows man as few
women do — she directs their energies,
gets out of them the most work pos
sible, pays their wages, employs or dis
charges . them. . Men, mules, steam '
shovels and dynamite are her obedient
agents. Necessarily she Is a financier,
talks and figures in toe hundred thou
sands and the millions as readily as
most men talk of dollars. In the par
lance of the street she long ago made
her stake and today is accounted toe
richest woman In Michigan and one of
tbe yery rich women of tae ■world. .
She bag made estimates and carried
out contracts on some of the longest
and heaviest pieces of railroad con
struction In the country. . Though ber
occupation is strenuous it would do
Mrs. Beacham rank injustice to say
that it has roughened her. There is
a certain sefcf determination and firm
ness about her features, but her man
ner is feminine, and so are her tastes.
She is such a good judge of men that
she rarely has any trouble with them
and it is not often that an employer
1s so genuinely popular with employees
as Mrs. BeacKam. ; ..: \\ "•-■.':'",
Mrs. Beacham has been making and
executing railroad contracts for twen
ty years. She has two sons Claud and
Erwin and her husband, though living
is an invalid.
Much of this remarkable ■woman's
work has been done in the southern
states where' railroad building has gone
forward with Titantic strides In the
last two decades . and where a vast
amount of building is now under way.
On one contract with the Tennessee
Central railroad, Mra. Beacham's profit
was $80,000, and it is calculated that
her average annual earnings are about
?50,000. The contract which Bhe Is
now engaged In executing is the con
struction of five miles of railroad from
Kirby Station, Virginia." westward. It
Is part of & contract for one hundred

Snccessfn! Parminif. fsfesSssS?iTEA RAISING IN THE UNITED
STATES.
Th» Department of Agriculture Present* American
Tea in Tablet Form, .-,
The Department of Agriculture has
been making some experiments, which
from present results seem to promise
a revolution in the method of pack
, ing and preparing tea. The usual
method adopted by . tea raisers here
tofore has been quite crude in that the
dried tea leaves were merely stowed
in a loose and bulky package. The
effort of the Department of Agriculture
is to furnish, pure tea in a most con
venient form and in a manner to pro
tect the leaves from .losing - any of
their strength through exposure to
the air. This has resulted in a meth
od of compressing the leaves Into tab
lets, each of sufficient size to make a
delicious cup of tea. What would or
dinarily make a big package of tea
can by this unique method be placed
in a space about the size of a safety
match box. Another significant feature
of the experiment is that the tea used
. \ TEA TABLETS.
The Bulk of Loose Leaves is Equal to One Box of Tablets. ■
in these tablets Is not imported, but,
on. the other hand, is grown at the
experimental tea gardens of the De
partment of Agriculture at Summer
ville, S. C. A few weeks ago Dr. B. Ti
: Galloway, chief of the Bureau of Plant
Industry received a large box of sam
ple packages - from Snmmerville.
*. Each box of compressed tea contains
twenty tablets about the size of a cent,
but probably twice las 'thick. . The
: various kinds of tea such as Oolong,
, American Breakfast, "black and green,
etc., are all prepared in tablet' : form
ranging from sepia to. dark green 'in
color. The tablets as heretofore stated
are made from tea grown at the Pine
hurst tea gardens Summerville, S. C.
and I contain , . the purest of leaves
thought to be unsurpassed by any im
ported tea. The tablet form is accom
plished by compression with machin
ery. ( The directions furnished for us
ing the tablets are as follows:
• "Drop one tablet in teapot for each
cup of tea Tdeslred. Pour In freshly
boiled water, and after allowing it to
stand four minutes, stir gently, strain,
and/ serve. If made in the cup, use one
tablet. Tea will immediately settle to
3 the bottom, of the cup, then strain the
liquor into another cup, a«d sugar and
cream as desired."
While it is explained by officials of
the Department that this new form of
tablet does not Improve the flavor or
taste of the tea, the chief value lies
in 'the fact that the product occupies
less space. - A pound package of or
dinary tea^- it is stated, would occupy
- about twenty-five times as much room
as one of these little packages of twen
ty tea tablets prepared by thg Agri
cultural Department.  • '
"Tea Handled by Machinery.
The effort of the Department of Ag
riculture for sometime; has been to
find means for providing food for the
,Army and Navy which could be pre
pared mi such a way as to save space.
' Tablet form naturally suggested itself
to them and! it is now believed by. the
government officials that the tea tab
lets will, fill the requirements noti'only
of the general government but those
of general merchandise and family use.
' An important feature in connection
with compression, of "tea into tablet
; form which should ,be considered of
prime importance is that modern'ma
chinery takes the place of the ancient
manual operations of the Chinese. Of
. course, a great advantage of the ma
chine in the tea industry is reduction
in the price of labor, but a more im
portant item is the elimination, as far
as possible, of human contact By tes
timony of travelers in the 1 Orient it
is stated that the tea factories of that
section- are as a rule anything but
' cleanly, the result of the herding to
'; gether of so many people— iiot very
dean or- healthy - people — in cramped
md often very, hot workshops; The
tea tablets as prepared by the Depart
ment of Agriculture, are made from the
tea after it has been dried and rolled.
It is then put through a boiling proc
' ess after which it is placed in small
moulds about the size of a cent, where
by means of great force, it is com
pressed into small tablets.-' The op
eration of the machinery Is so perfect
and so rapid that the leaves can be

plcked from the plant at noon and, in
less than three hours, or in time for
supper, can be. made into tablets and
ready to serve on the table. Few
GUY ELLIOTT MITCHELL
people of the United States are aware
that tea Is grown in this country. As
a matter of fact, however, this coun
try not only raises tea but produces
an ' article, said <by experts, to be of
a higher grade than Imported tea and
which has no equal for cup qualities.
For, years there has 'been a gigan
tic struggle between British and Chi
nese tea growers • for supremacy *in
the world's tea trade. . The most im
portant feature of this struggle has
been the substitution . by the British
of modern and specially constructed
machinery in place of the ancient man
ual operations which the Chinese seem
to envelop in mystery. Labor in In
dia, while cheap, was not cheap enough
to accomplish the overthrow of the
Chinese producers and leave a margin
of profit The conflict between ! the
rivals thus settled down' to a trial of
watch, . thermometer, and steam or
water power, against the unique and
unnecessarily elaborate functions of the
Chinese manipulator. ; On the up-to
date British tea estate almost the whole
process of tea making from the trans
portation of the plucked leaf from the
gardens to the | factory, to the final
boxing of the finished product, is per
formed by machinery. .With all this
machinery, however, it is necessary
that two processes must be performed
by human hands — the plucking of the
leaf from the bushes and the cutting
out of inferior leaf or accidental ad
mixtures such as stems, straws, etc.,
from the finished product
- The intense activity in the tea In
dustry of other lands awakened a like
Interest In lie United Btates. A hun
dred years ago the first tea plant was
introduced at Middleton Barony on the
Ashley River near Charleston, S. C.
Mr. Junius Smith in the forties made
experiments in tea culture at Green
ville, S. C. and In- the fifties the Uni
ted States Government collected in
Asia and distributed tea seed by the
Patent Office through the south Atlan
tic and Gulf states, which later gave
rise to many thrifty | littla gardens,
capable of supplying all domestic
wants. While these experiments prove
the adaptability of the tea plant to the
United States they did. not prove the
possibility of a lucrative industrial un
dertaking. The United States- Depart
ment of Agriculture, however; la the
last quarter of the 19th century un
dertook, an Investigation along, this lat-
ter line and established an experimen
tal station near Suinmerville, S. C
For various unavoidable reasons the
undertaking was a failure and aban
doned. Towards the close of the cen
tury Dr. Charles U. Shepard, at his
own expense renewed this plantation
and later received the general assis
tance of the Department of Agricul
ture. This Is the Plnehurst tea nur
sery ol to-day.
The American Tea Garden.
The Pinehnrst gardens embrace at
present about 90 acres of tea plants
in various stages of advancement and
produce from a considerable variety
of seed over 10,000 pounds of dry tea
annually. The original seed for the
Pinehurst tea gardens was- procured
through the offic.es of the United States
Department of State and the Chinese
Government from the celebrated Drag
on's Pool estate near Hangchow, China,
whose output commands too high a
local price to admit of its exportation.
Picking tea at Pinehurst is done by
a carefully trained and well superin
tended corps of colored children who
show great aptitude in this direction. la
stances haye 1 occurred of line plucking
by one child in a day of . over 50
pounds of greehleaf whereas the aver
age in the Orient hardly exceeds 20 to
30 pounds. Experiments at the Pine
hurst gardens show that tea from' all
modern climates could be made as pro
ductive here as at their source, a
change in climate and the difference in
cultivation and manufacture, having a
tendency, to affect the quality of tea
when prepared for the table.- This lis
the reason -assigned for the difference
in 'the American grown tea from that
of imported. The Pinehurst early sea
son tea is considered more delicate
and milder than that of cooler climates.
The autumn season tea is stronger in
color and , taste ' and resembles -the
product .from \the more, southern .re
gions of : the Orient
The Secretary of Agriculture believes
that there is an excellent field in the
United , States for a home i tea indus
dustryfor we, consume approximately
75,000,000 pounds of tea annually or
a little less than one pound per capita.
Our people, he says, pay at retail about
$40,000,0000 a year for tea as against
$150,000,000 for coffee and $1,200,000,
000 for alcoholic beverages. It has
been calculated that the American peo
ple drink 400,000,000 gallons of tea an
nually. We are primarily a nation of
coffee drinkers; in proportion to our
population we consume only about one
sixth as much tea as the Britain,
whether at home or In the colonies.
While the United States does not im
port the cheapest kind of tea, never
theless ' our importations are chiefly
of inferior qualities.' The first demand
of the American , consumer : is cheap
ness, and often-times he will purchase
tea of -poor quality on account of ac
companying allurements .of crockery

and other gifts. Nevertheless com
paratively small consignments of better

willing to pay for them.
Halt Coffee as Food.
A Russian army doctor attached to
the 2d Turkestan Rifle Battalion has
been making' some interesting experi
ments in the matter of nourishing sol
diers. Dr. Cyrillus Koljago adminis
tered to ten- men for ten days malt cof
fee'as their sola beverage, with the're
sult that their weight increased during
the time to the extent of 832 grammes
a man. A like experiment was' made
by giving tea to the same number of
men of similar constitutions and for
the same number of days, and in their
case the doctor certified a decrease of
weight per man to the extent of 520
grammes. He then put the twenty men
together back on to tea, and those whose
weight had been so signally increased
by the malt coffee had within ten days
lost 660 grammes a head. The doctor
now states what is very important to
notev namely, that his experiments have
led him to believe that it is not merely
the nourishing attributes of the malt
coffee which mark this increase,, but
that its effect is mainly to increase the
action of the digestive organs, enabling
them to draw from all other food taken
the utmost quantity of nourishment
each may contain.
An Insult to the Horse,
"Would you mind walking the other
way and not passing the horse?" said a
London cabman, with exaggerated po
liteness, to the fat lady who had just
paid the minimum fare. "Why?" she
inquired. "Because if 'c sees wot 'c's
been carrying, for a shilling 'ell 'aye a
fit," was the freezing ■ answer.
Philippine Cities.
There are four towns in the Philip
pines with a population exceeding
10,000 each, and thirty-five with a pop
ulation exceeding 5,000. Manila is the
the only incorporated city in the
islands, and its inhabitants number
344,732.
The Doekiag of Horses*
Agitation is promised to urge the pas
sage of laws against docking horses,
and owners of . horses are ■ being peti
tioned to join in the crusade. Dealers
never dock horses, except at the re
quest of a buyer. To offer a horse for
sale with a bob tail is to create the sus
picion that it is "second hand," one that
has seen service before in the city, in
stead of being fresh from. green past
ures. Yet the dealers rarely sign such
petitions. They declare that the opera
tion of docking is not excessively-pain
ful and is atoned for by the easy life
it leads to. To have the tail shortened
is the initiation the rough horse pays
to gain the comfort and light duties of
a private stable.
Fashion is not the only reason to act
uate the buyers in having their horses
docked,' but it is the principal one. A
few say that the shortening of the tail
makes for cleanliness, as the tail does
not become draggled with mud and dust
when docked, and another set ; main
tains ■ that it : is really a comfort . to . a
horse to remove the heavy useless mass
of hair. City horses do. not graze in
pasture, 'so the argument^' that the
switching . of the long tail keeps away
mosquitoes and flies ;has no .value in
this argument; but a decided ,' objection
may be voiced' against the j nuisance
switching tails would be, to ah orse or
pair in heavy harness. . All .' style and
grace in front action, a pair with hang
ing tails , would look as untidy j other
wise as a woman in bedraggled' skirts.
So said a coaching amateur, and he had
plenty to add "to the plea for docking.
"Essentially docking is not ' a painful
operation,", continued this driving man.
"We do not feed; the , horse on" the
morning of the operation, and when it
is brought into the operating stall the
horse at once begins to munch eagerly
on; the oats in the , manger. A "canvas
hammock is flung under its . belly and
the horse iis hoisted to its tiptoes by
pulleys, when a gate is stuck across the
stall close to its heels and the tail pull
ed over, the flat top rail making an
operating table.'- A stout twine is tied
tight about the tail at the point to be
severed. The hairjs turned back and
bound, exposing the bare skin. \■-.-"A\ ■ -.
"A few short jabs with a surgeon's
knife and the tail is severed. Mean
while, a cauterizing iron has • been
brought to a white | heat in a
hand fire, and the next act is' to ' sear
the cut with the iron. 1 The \ horse
winces/but it doe 9 not take the terrth

A lawyer whose mouth was extra*
ordinarily large, had on the witness
stand a Southern backwoodsman. Thel
witness had replied to a question that
"It was a rion-possibility." Quoth the
lawyer: "'A non-possibility"? Now"
will yon tell this court and this jury
what you mean by a non-possibility?
Give, us an example." "Well,", said
the witness, "I think it 'u'd'be a non
possibility to make your mouf .enny
bigger widout settin' your years furder
back," . '

When the last Cleveland baby was
born, Mr., Cleveland was asked about the
weight, which he gave at twelve pounds.
Dr. Bryant, who was present, interrupt
ed the ex-President to say that the nurse
had reported the young hopeful to be an
eight-pounder. "Nothing of the kind,"
said Mr. Cleveland. "I weighed him
with the same scales that I use when I
go fishing."
Death.
_ _ __.
(G. E. M.) «^S
I am a microbe of vast and fearful power.
My name is Death, where e'er I'm found.
I float through the air and sink '
into the vitals of the sons of men:
The youth In Joyous spring of life;
The man, mature In years and' strength;
The new-born babe and she .
Who watches tenderly his breath of
life: ■
The coyish maiden, and the sage
Of tottering steps and silver locks; \
All alike grow faint and listless.
Weak and wan, and sink at last
To their eternal rest, beneath my glance.
Quietly at first I work, mid 'jest and
• laughter.
But not more surely does the sun sink low
behind
The western hills
Than I make felt my power
Through every limb and fibre of my vic
tim's frame.
'Tls said that he laughs best who laugheth
last;
And I laugh last, yea many a million time
As I perceive my victim gazo with hollow,
vacant stare »
And note his breath come short, and
gasp»and — cease.
Ha! Ha! Another triumph of my prowess!
And now I float away to murder once
again —
To snatch some maiden from her lover's
arms;
To strike a youth, his mother's all:
Ceaseless my work. I know not pity.
Greedy am I, and each one whom I slay
adds fuel to my greed.
So do I live and reap my harvest day by
day of Death.
He Had Had Experience.
As the fearless white man entered the
kraal of the native : king, a salute was
sounded on a drum of serpent skin, and
six warriors with necklaces of human
teeth rattling about their throats, led
him before a rough ivory dias, on which
sat a majestic and . formidable figure.
"Hail,", said the white man. . And with
out loss of time, he took out one of his
brass watches, wound it up, and showed
its works to the dusky monarch. "This
marvel," he said, "I will - give - your
majesty, I making you the - envy of all
men, and in return for only six tusks
of seventy pounds' ; weight each. The
king took the watch,' produced a mo
nocle from a* pouch hidden in his shield,
and, after a j moment's study :of the
brass trinket, returned it with a languid
smile. "Last year," he added, "in Lon
don, I exchanged an old wooden war
club for a bushel of these things,, and,
by Jove, don't you know, ' there wasn't
one of them that ran above a week."
