t thirty reputed preventives of mos-

o oils. Only clove oil, caraway oil,
c cassia oil and oil of Spanish hops
p proved effective in keeping away t!ie
i insects, ana these only for a short
t time. It is concluded that the
r repellent effect is not duo to the
p penetrating odor but to temporary
i irritation of tho insects' breathing
o organs. Clove oil seems to be the
m mest suitable substance to use, and
t this will do good service m most

The new Zebra discovered by J. K.
Spears iv Portuguese, East Africa,
resembles the ordinary typo in shape,
but tbe bead, neck, forelegs acd
fore-half of tbo body are dark brown
in color, tho hind part of the body
including tho legs, having the usual
stripes. The natives report that the
animal is becoming very scarce,
although a whoJe herd was seen. The
creature is very timid, and its agiliiy
enabled it to elude the hunter, whose
long pursuit resulted in failure to
obtain a specimen. The new antelope
seen in the same region has the size
and shape of the iSoer roebuck .[or
irnpala, the chief difference beiug a
black line down the back and on each
hind leg. The species is exceediagly
wild ana active, lives in herds of ten

pearance as the group starts iv lliyhi
with a wild leap of ten feet or more.
Ihe remarkable heat insulating
effect of a vacuum is strikingly
brought out iv tbe claims made for a
new sportsmen's bottle. The vessel
has double walla, being really one
bottle within another, with a sealed
up intervening space from which tbe
air baa been withdrawn.
It is asserted that liquids in this
bottle can be kept hot tortyoight
hours in the coldest neather and that
iced beverages will retaiu their
delicious coolness for weeks in the
hottest summer.
In an electrolytic method of sharpen
ing tiles, tbe tool is coanected with
tbe positive pole of a battery of
twelve iiuusen cells, aud then placed
in a bath of 40 parts of sulphuric
acid in 1000 of water. Ihe negative
electrode is a spiral of copper wire
encircling the tile without touching
it. The process requires ten minutea,
and the renovated Hies are declared
to be as satisfactory aa when Brat
made.

there was a furthor loss of about

is that not less than 41 inches of raiu
must nave fallen iv about thirteen

THE SIEGE OF LUCKNOW.
T The following lines are founded
u upon a-truo incident in the siege of
L Luckuow. The Sepoy rebellion started
i v Lockunw in May, 1857. The Euro-
p pean residents were pent up in the
B British residency. They included a
m mere handful of soldiers, and women
a and children non-combatants. They
w were beseiged by an immense force
o of rebels. After four months they
w wore temporarily relieved by a force
u under Outram and liavelock, They
w wore not strong enough to raise the
s siege, but mere I v added slightly to
t the beseiged garrison. Weeks and
m months of hoping against hope, and
o odds of 20 to 1 intervened. Sir Colin
C Campbell started from Cawnpure, (50
m miles distant, with a force of GOOO
m men to reliove the garrison iuSepteoi
bber. lie fought several hatlles with
v va3tly superior forces of insurgents,
a and his"Lrmy was cut down to 1500.
H Ho was compelled to return to Oawn-
p pore to recruit his shattered forces.
l ln November ho started on his tinal
i inarch with his Highlanders. Jessie
n nrown, of Scottish birth, caught the
s sound of the bagpipes, amid the ioar

t tho approach of the salvation army:
D Dh, that last day in Lucknow fort— '■•

K Kor the enemy 's mines crept slowly

A And the end was coming last.
L L'o yield to that foe meant worse than

Mining Suit Retrial.
I'lie superior court was occupied the
better part of three days during tbe
past week in tbe trial of the case of
Mary A. Keyes aud W. B. Keyes,
plaintiffs, vs. John H. Meyers, de
f'endnnt. There was quite an array of
legal talent on both sides of the case.
l>or the plaintiffs, attorneys Will A.
Dower of San Andreas and Nicol &
Orr of Stockton bandied the case, aud
for the defendant attorneys Keed of
San Andreas and Philbrook & Owens
of San Francisco. Judge Kust "of
Auudor county presided, judge Mc-
Sorley boing disqualified on account
oi' having been attorney in the case at
t Cornier trial. Xhe suit involves a
tb'rd interest in th 9 Lindsay gold
mine at Angels, adjoining tbe (Jold
Cliff mine (one of the Utica grcup. )
In- January. 18U5, John Lindsay
made a deed of the proporty to
Meyers on conditions tbat Meyers
was to provide for Lindsay during
hia lifetime. Ihis deed was placed
in escrow with W. H. Stetfler with
instructions tbat it was net to be
delivered to either principal without
the consent of tbe other, except iv
case of death. An agreement was v
few days later tiled with tbe party
uolding tbe deed abrogating its con
ditions of surrender, but Moyeis, to
gain the property, must take care of
Lindsay during bis lifetime. Liud
say filed a statement to the tiled
that. Meyera failed to carry out tbe
conditions of tbe deed rind .revokod
the same. Some five or six years
after tbe deert to Meyers, Lindtay
died, and a short time before his
Jeath made a deed of the property to
Mrs Keyes, who was bla sister, at
whose homo he died, claiming that
Meyers had not carried out the pro
visions of the first deed aurt therefore
had no olaim ou the property other
than the- aincuuts he had paid out for
Ijiudsay.
Mrs Keyes and her husbaud com
menced suit for the property iv b'eb
ruary, 1902, and judge (Jottsshnlk de
cided iv favor of Moyors. In tbat
suit M^Sorley & Dower appeared for
plaiutitt's and Keed for defendant.
Mrs Keyes then appealed tho caEe
to tbe supreme court, aud tbat body
reversed judge Gottscbalk's decision,
Joldiug that the deed to Meyera was
not valid— baviug strings to it, it
may be said; aud that all be was
autitled to was actual expenses. De
•eudant's attorneys, however, kept at
it and finally got a new trial.
So the case this week was simply a
retrial. JNicol&JOrr were engaged
with Mr Dower, judgo McSorley iv
the meantime having been elected
superior judge. In this case Piiil
brook & Owens were added to the
counsel for the defense.
The case was hotly contested from
butb sides. Judge Kust will reudei
his decision iv tho matter later on.

Rattlesnake Under His Pillow.
The Calavera3 Chronicle tells this
story of the experieuco ot a bunter,
who ia the grandson of \V. P. Peek ot
Jackson:
Percy Peek, son ot postmaster Peek
of this place, who returned Saturday
lust from a three weeks' bunting and
fishing trip in tho higher Sierras,
relates the following thrilling exper
ience he had with a monster rattler.
When Percy started on his mountain
trip his hair was a dark brown, but
we notice now that it ia streaked
with white and be shudders as bo
tells his story. .there wero four in
tbo^party and it waa their third day
out. Having found a stream well
stocked with fish they concluded they
would call a halt for a couple of days
aud Bee if they could natch a mess or
two of the Uuny tribe. Aliout a half
a mile from their camping place
thero was an old deserted cabin, and
as the nights were extremely cold
Percy and hia companion concluded
to spread their blankets down ou tbe
floor rather thau sleep out of doors.
All went woil tuo first night, but tbe
awakening on the morniug of the
second waa somothiug horrible. Percy
and his companion retirsd very eaily,
being tirod aud worn out from their
day's jaunt, aud the eun was peeping
through the cracks of the old deserted
cabin when Percy yawned and
stretched hiaiself aftor , a sound and
refreshing night's rest. Just aa he
did so he beard tbe warning rattle
close to hia head. and on turning to
one side be met a sight that caused
the cold chills to run up aud down
bis spine and for a moment or two
hia whole body seornod paralyzed.
Protruding from underneath his
pillow wns about a foot aud a half of
a rattlesnake with its bead swaying
two and fro ready for instant battle
while from t tie other side of his pil
low camo tho constant daugor warn
ing. Percy dared not move nor did
he dare to call bis companion who
was sloepiug soundly a few teet away

from him. Moments seemed ages
but it was only a short time hefore
the snake began to slowly glide from
underuentb his pillow and crawled to
tho center of tbe room where he
coiled himself ready for a right, being
near enough to spring upon his ad
versary. With every nerve strained
to its utmost tension b"ercy slowly
crawled from underneath bis blankets
and soon had possession of bi3 faith
ful shotgun which he fortunately had
loft standing against the wall near
the heu'J of his bed. It was but tbe
work ot a second to cook the gun and
soon tho crack of both barrels re
sounded through the little cabin and
the rattler was quivering in tbe tbroes
of death. The report of tbe gun
awrka his companion with a sudden
-start but Percy soon assured him tbat
the dnnger mark had been passed.
Tha reptilo measured fuur feet and
two inches in length [and had four
teen rattles which Percy brought back
with iiim as a memento of his thrill
ing experience.

BERTHA'S
ENGAGEMENT.
The young woman in the hat that
resembled an inverted chopping Lo.vl,
with a yard of ostrich plume on one
side, hailed with excitement the girl
whose Headgear reminded _oue of a
rose bush on a rampage.
"Have you haard?" began the first
girl breathlessly, "ilow in the world
did she ever attract him? Why, bet
complexion is atrocious "
"What in tbe world are you talking
about? "demanded thp other girl.
"I'm talking about Bertha's engage
ment to Kichard Staitmouut."
"My gracious!",, cried .the young
woman in the flower hat, putting
down hei paokages hurriedly and
looking for a chair. "Yon don't mean
it! Well, there's nothing like perse
verance, is there? Goodness knows
that she's been trying hard enough to
get engaged for the last three years'"
"I3ut to that lovely Startmount
man'" mourned the girl in the droop
ing hat. "When there were so many
other.girls so much better suited to
him— and so much prettier—"
," Hut she's not even pretty at all!"
objected the second girl, aggrieved.
"And as for style— Bertha may mean
well, but has about as much style a.
a dress reformer! Wnat could he see
in her.?"
"Isn't it absolutely funny?" agreed
the girl iv the large hat. "1 should
think be could see the be
tween her and— and others. Of course,
when Kichard used to call on mo so
muoh 1 never really went to any extra
trouble to entertain .him, though 1
did manage to show him how pleasant
a girl with some originality could
make It for a man. Mot that 1 claim
to be brilliant, but—"
"Oh! it must be hard for you,"
oroke in the girl with the flower hat,
sympathetically. "1 had forgotten
how infatuated you were— that ;is, of
course, you didn't realize it, dear;
but you really made a dreadful goose
of yourself over Kichard Startmount.
1 always defended you when people
said you ran aftar him — "
"That was sweet of you," said the
girl in the big bat, with daggers in
her voice. 'Of course'you judged by
yourself, ana aoaUl not realize it was
quite the other way round. Naturally
you could sympathize with such a sit
uation bad it been true, after the way
you got laughed at about youngßmith.

As soon as he could escape from

"Keally, dear," interrupted her

me with some one else. 1 oan't im

Young Smith always bored me. But
1 can't get over my surprise at Ber

" lreally don't know," said the gill
in tbe large bat, icily, "who could
appreciate a situation like tbat better
than yourself! You know perfectly
well tbat you couldn't talk of any
thing else tbe time Kichard took you
to the theater twice in one week."
", Do you still remember tbat?"
dra.vled tbe girl iv tbe flower bat,
with an aggravating smile. "1 know
you were furious at the time."
X'be giil in the big bat laugbed dra
matically. "As tbougb 1 cared wbat
Kichard iStartmount did!" she in
sisted. "1 just told you of bis en
gagement because 1 thought you'd be
particularly interested! 1 don't care
a particle!"
"It is absolutely nothing to me,"
declared tbe girl in tbe flowered bat.
"Absolutely."
"But what on eartli he could see in

two minutes of sileuco.
"That's just wbat 1 say!" agreed
the girl in the flowered bat. — Chicago

THAT ADVERTISING SCHEME.
A An allegnd scheme of advertising
t the resources ot Amador county was
v very properly turned dowu by the
b board of supervisors at their last
m meeting. This scheme was neither
m more nor less than a grafting pro-
p position. The Dispatch was a party
t to this scheme, if not as an active
p promoter, at least lin furthering it
w witb.spaue in its columns in the
c carry iug out of the plan.— .Ledger.
T Tho above is neither more nor less
t than a deliberate lie. Some weeks
a ago id. A. Ferguson, whose business
i is to write up sketches of the various
b business men and publish thorn in a
l local paper, charging each business
m man according to the length of the
s sketch, contracted with The Dispatch
f for a certain amount of space and
s several, thousand extra copies of the
p paper, 'tie also interviewed the board
o of supervisors, stated his business
a and ottered to get up a largo special
e edition, descriptive of the various
r resources of the county, profusely
i illustrated with half-tones of the
d different points of interest in the
c county if the board would lend
t their aid financially. — Dispatch.
O Our cotemporary endeavors to hood-
w wink the people by giving out the
a above as a refutation ot the statement
c contained in the extract from the
L Ledger, to the effect that the Dis-
p patch was counted in on the scheme
t to extract money from the oounty
a and the business men on an alleged
a advertising of the county's resources.
We place the two statements together,
so tbe reader can judge for himself.
Out of its own mouth let the Dis
patch be judged. Its own admissions
are a full vindication of the Ledger's
position. While the plan to raid tbe
county treasury did not work, the
business men fell into tbe trap, and
have been kicking themselves ever
Biuce. Now tbe Dispatch cannot
plead ignorance in this case. The bo
oalled presentation of Amador's re
sources was well known before tbe
matter was published. The stuff was
set up and printed iv its office. The
subscribers to the puffing notices
were misled, but not our cotemporary.
The contributors gavo believing that
by so doing they were helping to
attract immigration to this section.
But the Dispatch printed and pub
lished the columns of trash with the
full knowledge that it was nothing of
the kind. Each business man or
official, as the case might be, was
given to understand that others were
patronizing tbe scheme, and in this
way many were roped iv by the force
of example and numbers, only to find
out that in many instances they bad
been deceived. Of course, tbe pro
moter, who, as the Dispatch says,
"makes a business" ot this sort of
thing, naturully pressed it for all
there was iv it. When the wonderful
article appeared, that was to lift
Amador oounty into an active com
petitor for home-seekers, it was noth
ing more than an insipid repetition
of puffs for those who had paid their
?5 to the promotion fund, ior the
benefit of tbe Dispatch and the itiner
ant boomer. Our cotemporary can
didly admits that it sold its columns
for this very purpose— knowiugly,
deliberately, aided tbe palpable piece
ot humbuggery. And it can see noth
ing wrong iv this. That is the worst
feature of it. It is blind to tbe pro
minent part it took in tbe graft work
ed upon an innocent public, and tbe
barm it has thereby wrought agairjst
any legitimate plan that may here
after be devised to advertise Amador
county as v desirable location for
home-seekers. According to tbe Dis
patch, it was treading in the path
ot upright, honorable journalism in
selling out to tbe schemer. If tbe
Ledger had resorted to such pracicp,
what a bowl would have gone up from
the "gang." The "thousands of ex
tia copies," of tue boom editiun de
Jivered to tbe victims are still lying
on tbe shelves of tbe subscribers, who
are too disgusted with tbe sbeme to
send them out, or use them in any
way for advertising purposes.
We do not deem it necessary tn
notice tbe flings of tbe Dispatch at
tbe Ledger on the rejection of a claim
for advertising a notice to taxpayers
inserted under Norman's administra
tion aud continued and paid for
under Gregory's administration. We
have ventilated that all we oaro
to, and leave a discerning public to
judge the right or the wrong of it.
But we will inform our cotemporary
that there is a striking difference
between the policy ot the Ledger and
the Dispatch .in asking assistance
irom the county for advertising
schemes. The Ledger has never been
a party to raiding the county treasury
for such purposes. It has always
opposed falling back upon the super
visors in aid of such schemes, and
that too in face uf the iact that tbe
financial interests of the proprietor
would be promoted by the granting
of the solicited aid. We havo never
been "hired" to remain silent, much
less to advocate, or sell our editorial
and news columns to any man or
body of men for "boosting" private
enterprises, under tbe guise of ad
vertising tbe resources of the county.
The reference of our cotemporary to
the "clean bill of good character"
given by the supervisors, by selecting
the Dispatch as the official paper for
the following year, and the publica
tion of tbe tax list when tbe bids
were alike, is amusing. It pleases tbe
Dispatch to hug that delusion. He
is welcome to all the comfort he can
extract from it. But a discerning]
public will take no stock in that plea, j

San Francisco's Plight.
I in' San Francisco situatiou is not
oleHriug as rapidly as the well-wishers
of that city would like. The vio
lence in connection with tbe car
strike continues on a small scale, and
the arrests are daily diminishing. A
conciliation committee ot prominent
citizens is endeavoring to bring about
peace by a compromise. uovernor
Gillett says that violence must stop,
and talks of arbitration and all that.
It is within his province to restore
peace. He has the militia behind
him. If tbe municipal authorities
are helpless or in sympathy with tilt
scenes of violence, he can lull back
upon the state organization. Action
is wanted in this emergeucy, not
words. If tbe military arm of tbe
state government had been called out
in the first days of the strike, tbe
industrial atmosphere of tbe city
would certainly hive cleared long ere
this, and normal conditions restored.
No doubt, governor Gillett is prompt
ed by laudable motives in trying to
secure a meeting ot the opposing
forces, in the hope of bringing about
a settlement. But a compromise will
not settle the question in issue, it
might postpone tho Dual issue; defer
it for a few mouths or years. The
straight path in settling such contests
is to enforce the law; suppress vio
lence; arrest and punish violators;
punish them adquateiy, not by a
mere nominal line. The street cars,
and tuusj who ride therein, arc
entitled to protection. It has not
baen, and is not, being given them;
and it is up to the state authorities
to do that which tbe municipal
officers have failed to do. Calboun
wauts the be protected in his right to
run bis lawful business as a street car
president. He is still tbe only char
acter in this strile situation that
stands erect »iid resolute. He is not
afflicted with a wobbling of the knees.
The Assessment Roll.
Assessor C. E. Jarvis has devoted
considerable time in straightening out
tbe errors of the assessment roll, aud
in the equalization of assessments.
It is generally the case, that with the
advent of a new official id tbe assess
ment of property, changes are made
to suit tbe notion of the individual
doing tbe work. The incumbent be
lieves that he can improve upon the
work of his predecessor. This is a
laudable work, and tbe proper spirit
upon which to enter upon any official
duty. As regards tbe assessment roll,
we understand that numerous changes
will be made this year. All property
that has beeu deeded tc tbe state foi
delinquent taxes has been dropped
from tbe roll. This will involve a
reduction of fully 8100,000. It has
served no good purpose to burden the
assessment roll with such property,
as state pioperty is not assessable,
and to list such holdings year after
year, involves a lot of unnecessary
work, without any henetioial result
whatever. Notwithstanding this ap
parent rednction, there will be no
shrinkage of the total value ot the
county's assessment. Some of the
mining property, and the large land
holdings will be increased. Reduc
tious have also been made in a num
ber of instances, to meet tbe special
conditions. The assessor appears to
have approached the work in a fair
and liberal spirit; aiming to act
justly with everyone. ;\o reasonable
man should find fault with a re
adjustment of values so made. As a
rule, a property owner is not averse
to au equitable assessment. He is
willing to stand a little raise, if
assured that tbe aim is to biing
about more equitable distribution ot
tbe burdens of taxation.

Danger in Delay
Kidney Diseases are Too
Dangerous for Jackson
People to Neglect.
The great danger of kidney troubles
is that they get a firm hold before
the sutterer recognizes them. Health
is gradually undermined. Backache,
headache, nervousness, lameness,
soreness, lumbago, nrinaiy troubles,
dropsy, diabetes and Brigbt's disease
follow in merciless succession. Don't
neglect your kidneys. Cure the kid-
neys with the certain and sate remedy^
Doan's Kidney Pills.
Mrs U. Hutchius of 801 C street,
Marysviile, Calif., says: "When 1
commenced taking Doan's Kidney
l ills I was suffering from lame back.
1 had it by EpeJls, and it was often
exceedingly painful, especially when
1 stooped or straightened up, causing
severe twinges, 1 knew of Doau's
Kidney Pills curing others of similar
trouble and decided to try them. 1
went to a drug stoio and got a bex.
The result was that 1 obtained such
great benefit that 1 can highly re-
commend this remedy to all sufferers
from backache or any kidney ail-
ment." For sale by all dealers,

Fishing at Lake Tabeaud
The open season for fishing ia Lake
I'abeaud,— the reservoir of the Stand
ard .Electric Company — cotnruoueed
last Saturday. A few visited this
sheet of water on that day, but the
oalch was light. On Sunday there
must have been over fifty persons
pickuicking and Oshing there. Thfy
wertj divided into half a dozen differ
ent parties. Dr. C. A. Herrick, wife
and sou, J. W. Caldweil and wife
and W. J. Peters formed ona party.
J. Garbarini, and wife, A. Arata
aud wife, and a dozen or so ot others
formed party. Tho fishing
•»as not good. One or two parties
caught nothing the entire day. John
Garuarini made the record catch
•vith eighteen fish. They were mostly
small. The largest caught weighed
in the neighborhood of two pouuds.
Many are inclined to believe tbat the
pond is not well stocked; that the
spawn escaped or was destroyed by
the process of cleaning tho reservoir
last season. Anyway, sporting was
anything but lively. The company
also complain at this early part of
the season, about some of the visitors,
t'bey have adopted a rule that every
individual going tbere to fish must be
provided with a permit, whether be
longing to a numerous party or otner
wise. A permit by one of a party
will not be sufficient to admit all
the members.
A prompt, pleasaut, good remedy
for coughs and colds, is Kennedy's
Laxative Cough Syrup. It is especial
ly recommended for babies and chil
dren, but good for every member of
the family. it contains no opiates
and does not constipate. Contains
honey aud tar aud tastes nearly as
good as maplH syrup. Children like
it. Sold by F. \V. Kuhser.
Terribly Scalded.
A most distressing accident occurr
ed last Saturday at the boarding
bouse of A. Perovich, on Broadway,
which is liuble to terminate fatally
to the three year old child of Mr and
.Mrs John Glavich. The child's
mother had just drawn a tub of al
most boiling water frcm the heater
with which to do some household
work. 'JLhe little one was near by, as
the vessel containing the hot water
stood on the floor. in a playful
:noqd, the child stepped backward
against the tub of water, and foil
backwards into it. One of the
boarders rescued the little one in a
monient'from its terrible plight, and
iv doiug so scalded his. own hands
severely. L'he child was scalded fully
one halt the surface of the body.
Medical aid was at once summoned,
and everything was done for its
relief. Whether its life can to saved
is still uncertaiu. For two or three
days after, the child was in an un
conscious state. The lather was away
iv one of the mining camps of Nevada,
but was sent for as soon as possible,
and reached here Wednesday evening.
lltI It seems that after getting the
w water ready, preparatory to doing
s some scrubbiug, tho mother was
h handed a letter from her husband,
n nnd at once. retired to another loom
t to read its contents, leaving the hot
w water in tho room. While she was
a way the child backed against the
v vessel, tilting it up so that the
s scalding contents were poured over
i its body.
T The child died early Tuesday morn
iing.

Affairs of Jackson Shoe Store.
The financial affairs ot J. Mc-
Cutcheu, of the Jackson Shoo Store,
are still unsettled. The attachment
unaor the board of trade creditors is
still- uureleased. J. AlcOutchen, ac
companied by Jos. Kosenburg of
Woodland, returned from the city
last Wednesday. Tbere had bacu uv
adjustment with the creditors up tc
that time. Whether the matter will
be settled without a resort to the 6low
process of the bankruptcy court is
unoertnin. It is said tbat a com
promise may be affected the latter
part ot this week. Mr Kosenburg left
for his homo iv Woodland yesterday

Pasturing on Reserve Lands.
Mr Sears, a government employe
connected with the fore3t reserve ser
vice, went up to the borders of the
reserve in this county a few days ago.
The cattle have not yet commenced
to go into the reserve land in any
great numbers It is too early iv
the season. Mr Sears mission is tv
count the of cattle in each
bauJ the owner of which have per
mits to pasture cattle. He will pro
bably iemaiu there a considerable
portion of the summer, collecting
datn of this nature. Those who have
applied for permits to graze a certain
uumber of cattle, cannot, after the
season commences, increase the num
ber. They are restricted to the num
ber originally applied for. The Kllis
Bros, started Wednesday with thoir
tull baud for the mountain ianges.
The feed is scant in the valley this
year, and the hay crop is short.
Hence tho immigration to the high
lauds will start as early as possible.
It is expected that the feed in the
mountain ranges will bo uuusually
good, owing to the heavy snowfall of
last winter.

Improving the Cemetery.
Two weeks ago last Saturday the
question was raised about gutting
tuuds to pay the yearly water rate 3
tor the Protestant cemetery. Several
ladies asked me to take hold and see
.-.hat could be done. 1 met with so
much good-will and financial aid
that last Tuesday the water wa3
turned on and a pressure of 20 feet
tram each hydrant was the result.
The cemetery has now 11 hydrants
ill in good condition, and a supply
o£ water to answer all requirements.
A 2 inch pipe taps The water-maiu
on Stasal avenue, 200 ieet in length,
thence 3GO feet of 1 icch pipe is distri
buled through the cemetery, the cost
will be near S7O. 1 wil give a report

Suffering from Cancer.
Mis MagdalenaKatto, 'who has lived
for many years on the south branch
uf Jackson creek, was subjected to a
critical operation at the Sierra Sani
tarium on Monday last. She lias been
a sutferer from some internal troublo
for a long time. It was diignosed as
a tumor of the stomach, but whether
of a simple or canoerous nature could
not be ascertained except by au
operation. The hope was held out
that if of a simple nature it might be
successfully removed, but if of a
cancerous uature there was. little hopo
of relief. She was removed to the
sanitarium, resolved to accept the
heroic treatment that held out the
only hope ot relief. The abdominal
cavity was opened by the regular
staff, Dra. Phillips and Goodrnan.
It was found that the disease was a
cancer in an advanced stage, involv
ing the stomach and bowels, and that
nothing whatever could be attempted
in surgery for relief. Tho patient
was awa-e of the seriousness ot the
case, und wished to see the mombers
of her family before submitting to
the knife. Her son, Antone Katto,
who has been engaged in building
operations in Sun Franoisco, arrived
Sunday evening.

Do You Want to Know

T There is a growing sentiment in this
c country in favor of medicines of kno-.vw

s should have some interest in the compo-
s sition of that which he cr sho is expected

Like the Mythical Dragon.
In the Malay archipelago is a reptile
much like the mythical dragon. It has
false ribs that extend the loose skin
and form its wings. There is also a
frog with spreading feet that makes a
parachute which enables it to flit from
tree to tree, and a flying lemur that can
spread out its whole body like an um
brella and leap and fly a hundred feet
at a time, from the top of one tree to
another.

The Oldeat Bank Notes.
The oldest bank notes in the world
are the "flying money," or convenient
money, first Issued in China in 2G97
B. C. One writer tells that the ancient
Chinese bank notes were in many re
spects similar to those of the present
day, bearing the nams of the bank,
the date of issue, the number of the
note, the signature of the official who
Issued it and its value in both figures
and words. On the top of these curi-
CU3 notes was the following philosoph
ic Injunction: "Produce all you can;
spend with economy." The note was
printed in blue ink on paper made
from the fiber of the mulberry tree.
One of these notes bearing the date
1309 B. C. Is still preserved in the Asi
atic museum at St. Petersburg.
STOPPED THE OVATION.
I Itlcbard V.'ajracr'j Peculiiir Expert'
e euce In Vienna.
I "When Wagner mm at the height of
his popularity ho visited Vienna. Ear-
ioa yon Benst, then chancellor of the
! empire, was Informed that the Prus
]] sian part}' intended to give him an im-
m mense £e:'enaUe — a serenade which
| would have the air of German protest
; against the tendency of the ministry to
j make the onion of Hungary and Aus
ttria more intimate. The demonstration
' promised to arouse strong feeling.
'•Your excellency is warned," said
! the chancellor's advisers. "It is impos
|| sible to stop this manifestation unless
I Wagner goes away, and he love 3 ova
;; tions too well. Nothing will induce him
; to depart."
" "You think so," said Deust, with a
I smile. •
An hour later Wagner was invited to
dine with the chancellor. He was flat
tered by the invitation and accepted it.
; After dinner, at which Beust was de-
lightfully affable and entertaining, the
: chancellor remarked: "Ilerr Wagner,
' are you Interested in autographs? 1
have some very curious ones to show
you." And he opened a portfolio where
were letters of Palmerston, Bismarck,
Napoleon 111., Heine and others.
Suddenly turning to a paper, dated
1848, he said: "Ah, look at this. It Is
very curious. What would your friend
his highness the king of Bavaria say if
this paper, which would be significant
in connection with the political sere-
ncde which the Germans are going to
give you, should be published tomor
row in the Vienna papers?"
The composer examined the paper
and recognised, with surprise, an old
proclamation of one Richard Wagner,
who, au ardent revolutionist in 1848,
had proposed to the youth of that time
to set fire to the palace of the king of
Saxony. He saw his autograph and
that it might be the means of getting
him into serious trouble.
"Very curious, is it not, Herr Wag
uer?" said the minister.
"Very curious, your excellency," re
plied his guest.
The next morning Richard Wagner
left Vienna, recalled to Baireuth by
urgent business.— Strand Magazine.
MAKING WAMPUM.
A ProeexH Thut Requires Both Pa-
tience and Skill.
With certain tribes wampum is still
highly priz»xi and necklaces are worn
by men, women and children when
they are the fortunate possessors of
them. To ma,ke wampum various kinds
of shells are u^ed, white and those
having a lavender hue being most
liked.
The thin shells are broken into little
pieces and by aid of nippers are made
as nearly round as possible. When
each piece is drilled in tlie center, the
old time fire kindling style of drill be
ing used, the shells are then strung and
rolled with the hand on a flat stone,
which grinds them until they are
smooth and even.
Comparatively few Indians among
those w!io prize wampum beads most
highly have the skill or patience to
make them, even though they had the
material:;. The fact is there are but
few wampum bead makers in the coun
try, and \\ often happens that long pil
grimages Timst be made to secure the
requisites for really fine beads, and, as
with the white man's trinkets, that
which is "far fetched and dear bought"
Is most sought after for ornamentation.
Around some of the ancient ruins in
the southwest the little disks of wam
pum are often found in the sand, and it
Is probable that they were deposited
in the graves in very early times and
washed out or exposed by the wind's
action. These ruins are in the best
state of preservation of any in the
country. Absolutely nothing is known
of their builders, and the origin of
these ruins was as much a mystery
when Coronado first saw them in 1540,
when he made his famous invasion, as
it is to the people of the present day.- -
Indian's Friend.
Peasant and Klnt.
Henry IV., the Idol of the French
people, was also a king of phrase mak
ers. During one of his tours through
France he arrived at a small village
and ordered that the most intelligent
villager be sent to converse with him
while he dined. When the rustic ap
peared the king ordered him to take a
seat opposite to him at the table.
"What is your name?" asked the mon
arch. '-Sire, lam called Gaillard," re
plied the peasant. "What is the dif
ference," said the king, "between gall
lard" (i. c., a jolly fellow* "and pail
lard" (i. c., a rake)? "Sire," was the
reply, "there is but a table between
the two."

WAGER OF BATTLE.
¥ke First Duels Arc Suiil to liar*
Been Fouel:t Iv Italy.
The first duels were fouprht In Italy,
according to Millingen, who speaks of
a manuscript discovered at Cassel and
describes a duel between a father anil
a sou iv the reign of the Emperor The
odorle. When Charlemagne forbade
wager of battle among the Lombards
he encountered the fiercest opposition
from the nobles. Early In the ninth
century De Medlcls, a knight, defeated
In single combat the bandit Mugel,
who devastated the Florentine district
now called after him, Mugello. Otho
11. granted the prayer of the nobility
for the re-establishment of wager of
battle In 988. Women and priests
were not compelled to accept it. The
Normans showed less gallantry. With
them a woman had to accept, nor could
she name a champion. Her male op
ponent, however, was buried to his
waist In the earth. Armed with a
club, he tried to strike her as she cir
cled around him, his weapon being a
ball of iron at the end of a cord. If he
failed to touch her at the third at
tempt he was vanquished, which
meant to him death with dishonor.
Beccarln says that the reason so
many duels were fought in Italy in
the early days Is that where the law
does not afford protection one njust
look to single combat to retain the re
spect of one's fellow men. In the mid
dle ages the ferocity of Italian duels
passes belief. "Any way of putting an
enemy to death ('ognl modo') Is good
enough," says one of their writers.
"When an Italian spares his vanquish
ed adversary." says Brantome, "he
maims his arms and legs and gives
him as a memento of his kindness and
generosity a hideous gash across the
face." Lampagnano practiced on a
painted model of Galeazzo Sforza be
fore he stabbed him. Dueling was
called "la scienza cavalleresca."—Corn

DRINK MORE, EAT LESS.
Advice For Those With Rheumatism,
Gont, Ecirma and Neuralgia,
If people would take less nutrition
and drink more water, there would be
less rheumatism, gout, eczema and
neuralgia in the world. The most fre
quent cause of these derangements Is
an excess of nutritive materials. The
blood is surcharged with salts that
are not needed In the system.
The doctors are trj'ing to remedy
these diseases by giving something to
eliminate the salts, such as purgatives,
diuretics and solvents of various
kinds. The rational way, however, to
cure such affections is to stop the
cause. Drink more water; eat less
meat and concentrated foods. This
shuts off the supply of urates In the
blood. '
Those who take active exercise ip
the open air every day require a great
er amount of nutrition. Not only do
they use up the nutritive materials In
muscular exercise, but the amount of
oxygen Inhaled because of their activ
ities thoroughly oxidizes the urates and
changes them in urea. If the blood Is
loaded with urates they are very like
ly to crystallize, especially in those
portions of the body where the circula
tion Is the least and the temperature
Is the lowest, such as the elbows, an
kles, the toes and fingers.
Drink more water; eat less food.
This is a prescription that Is worth
more to such people than all the drugs
In the world. Shut off the source of
urate poisoning and the effects of
urate poisoning will disappear.—Ex
change.
The Gentlemanly Leopard.
The cheetah has a reputation as -one
of the most gentlemanly of beasts. A
story from Ootacamund shows what
fine manners the animal h»s. Three
Calcutta visitors to the hill station
were out on a tramp when they were
overtaken by a thunderstorm, accom
panied by sheets of rain. They spied a
cave In the side of the hill, and Into It
they rushed. When the rain stopped
they came out and, to their sururlse.
found a cheetah sitting licking the
heavy wet off his waistcoat and his
paws. It was his cave, but rather than
deprive his visitors of their shelter the
polite creature had sat outside In the
driving tempest. With a friendly mew
and gracefully wagging his tail, the
cheetah bade adieu to his guests and
walked with dignity into his house.—

How to Succeed In Literature.
The qualities which I consider most
conducive to success in literature are
Imagination, coupled with a great
knowledge of the world, concentration,
the willingness and ability to work
hard, a considerable knowledge of
business and a firm determination to
ignore the instructions of literary and
other agents with regard to what the
reading public may be supposed to re
quire. If any author once loses his in
dependence In writing he may be call
ed finished, so far as any career is In
question.— John Oliver Hobbes.
Rainy Day Money.
"Is your husband putting by any
thing for a rainy day?" asked the pru

Smart Youth.
"Young man, there are two question!
In life— 'Will it pay?' and 'Is it right?'
Which shall you choose?"
"Both. I'll use the first up to fifty,
and then I can probably afford to
adopt the second."— Houston Chronicle.

GOLD AND THE SEA.
W Why the Metal Is Skipped In Bars
R Rather Than In Coin. j
" "When the banks ship gold across
t the Atlantic," said a banker, "they pre
ffer to ship it in bars rather than •in
c coin. It loses loss that way."
" "It loses le*>?"
" "Yes, sir. If $1,000,000 in gold coins
i is shipped across the sea it is only
? 009,500 on its arrival. It loses from
t twelve to fifteen ounces, about $200,
t through abrasion, through knocking
a about with the motion of the waves.
T The sea makes gold lose weight, you
s see, the same as It does human beings
G Gold bars lose less. In fine weather
t they will only lose about $100 to each'
m million. In the ugliest weather they
d don't lose over $150, whereas in like
c conditions gold coins have been known
t to lose $:;00. As gold shipments of $10,
000,000 often occur, to make these ship-
m ments in gold bars instead of gold coin
i is a saving of $1,000 or more. It is odd
t to think when you cross in one of those
g gold laden ships that every wave that
h hits the boat clips off 10 to 15 cents
f from its golden cargo."— Philadelphia

Cr-jel, bnt Necessary.
The Eskimos dread the winter and
take early precautions to provide
against famine. As the season ap
proaches the groat herds of reindeer
migrate southward, and the walrus or
the seal are all that remain for food.-
When an in wind is blowing the wal
rus Is easily found oa the outer edge
of tho Ico packs. When it is blowing
off the shore, however, the ice packs
sail out to sea with the walruses on
them. The natives then class their
numbers in a list from the strongest to
the weakest. Tha food that Is in store
is divided up, the weakest having the
smallest quantity, the strongest the
largest. Thus the mightiest hunters
have strength to provide for the oth
ers. It is a cruel system, but neverthe
less a necessary one. If all were weak,
all would die; if some are strong, they
will save many of the weak.

TfHS APACHES.
This Tribe Holds the Record as Bail
Indians.
Scarcely a tribe of our American In
dians but what have engraved their rec
ord of crime and Infamy high up on
history's wall, yet above them all Is the
Apaches'.
From 1540 to 1553 New Spain and
Mexico carried on a so called warfare
with these people. The Apaches were
vastly outnumbered by the Mexican
soldiery, but what they lacked in num
bers was more than made up in cour
age and craftiness. The Apache ever
had a thorough contempt for the Mexi
can soldier, and in later years, when
they were fighting with firearms as
well as arrows, they would not waste
cartridges on the Mexicans, but would
kill them with arrows, spears and
stones, saving their cartridges for other
and more worthy foes.
When this southwest region became
a part of the United States the Apaches
were a serious problem with which we
had to contend. Our government vacil
lated between a simpering peace policy
and the other extreme, their extermina
tion.
Their zou* of wandering being inter
sected by the international boundary
line further complicated matters. They
would raid down Into Mexico and then
rush back with the plunder to our side
of the line, out of reach of the pursuing
soldiers. Next It would be a raid on
the Arizona side and a flight into the
wild mountains of Souora. The Mexi
can government attempted to assist
their miserable army by giving a scalp
bounty, and for years they paid out
their gold coin for Apache scalps.
Scalp hunting became a recognized in
dustry. The horror of this was that to
the Mexican official all scalps looked
alike, whether from the head of a hos
tile or a friendly Indian. The price
was $100 for a man, $50 for a woman
and $25 for a child. It frs small wonder
that the tribe sank deeper into sav
ngery than ever when we stop to think
that the men knew there was a price
set on the sealp3 of their wives and
children, and there was a horde of
human fiends, white in color, but more
savage than the savage himself, who
wore hunting them as thoy would a
coupar of the mountains.— E. S. Curtis
in Scribner's.

■Caterpillar FeveF.
The symptoms of the ailment knows
to doctors as "caterpillar rash" are h>
tense irritation on the palms, and some
times on the face, accompanied by a
number of bUstcrllke swellings which,
when they occur round the eyes, some
times have the effect of obstructing
vision. The preventive is to leave
hairy caterpillars alone. As the
"palmer worm," the hairy caterpillar
of tho gold tail moth, one of the com
monest and most beautiful objects of
the country nt midsummer, passes
from hand to hand, it leaves on every
palm a few of its loosely attached
hairs, and those hairs are possessed,
for the protection of the caterpillar
against bird,3 aud browsing animals,
of what scientists call "urticating prop
erties." "Uitica" is the Latin for "net
tle." Many other hairy caterpillars are
almost as bad as the 'palmer worm,"
and as a general rule the loss you han
dle any hairy caterpillar the better.—

Tiie Bcneflt of Exercise.
Exercise docs for the body what the
mountain side does for the stream of
water. When the water runs down the
mountain side It \a a babbling brook,
leaping out into the air now aud then,
throwing itself into spray, exposing it
self to tho ;iir and sunshine aud the
waters are crystal pure. Iv the valley
or on a level plain the waters may form
stagnant pools and get covered over
with slime of all sorts and Inhabited
by all kinds of filthy creeping things.
Some people lot themselves get into the
condition of that stagnant pool and
then wonder why the frogs croak in
their brains aud why the birds do not
sing instead. When a person gets Into
the condition where the body Is like a
stagnant pool a radical change must be
made in his life. Ha must begin by
getting vitalized, new blood into all his
cells and tissues.— Good Health.
Jackson In TrlnmpU.
After the battle of New Orleans, says
Thomas E. Watson in his magazine,
when the victor had been crowned with
laurel in the cathedral and acclaimed
like a demigod through the streets, it
was of his mother that he spoke to the
officers whom he was about to disband
•—their glorious work being done.
"Gentlemen, If only she could have
lived to see this day!" As you follow
the narrative of Andrew Jackson's ca
reer, you will hear him say many
things that you will not approve, will
see him do many things which you
cannot applaud, but when you re
call that at the very top notch of his
success and his pride his heart stayed
in the right place and was sore because
his mother could not be there to glad
den her old eyes with the glory of her
sou you will forgive him much In his
life that was harsh and cruel and ut

we can discover, was little Catherine
Apsley, who had only seen four sum
mers when she became the wife of the
first Earl Bathurst, who was exactly
double her age. The tiny ring worn
by Catherine on this occasion, over
two centuries ago, is still preserved.
Lord Bathurst survived to see the
eighty-third anniversary of his wed
ding day, while his lady was a wife fot
seventy-six years. — London Chronicle.
CHIRSCHMUS.
A Swi*» Dainty That Ia Made of Pre
kitvoU Cherries.
Last summer I ate genuine Swiss
chirschmus twenty years old. It tasted
like a concentration of all the richness
and sweetness of the most perfect
cherries. In appearance it was a pur
plish black mas 3. Age had not impair
ed It in the least
Upon inquiry I learned how this
cherry concoction, with its wonderful
preserving quality, Is made. The cher
ries used must be perfect— very largo,
ripe, juicy black ones and, above all,
very sweet.
The juice of them pressed out and
strained through a bag is put In a
large preserving kettle, at the bottom
of which Is placed a piece of smoked
pork fastened to a block of wood. The
wood serves as a weight to keep the
fat down and prevent the juice from
burning as it thickens.
The cherry juice is boiled for about
twenty-four hours without sugar, but
stirred from time to time until It
becomes a mass of sweetness so firm
and thick that it would not fall if the
kettle were inverted.
That Is all, a simple process, but the
result is delicious. This chirschmus is
In general use in Switzerland with the
"susse anke" (sweet butter) and bread.

Feeding; Silkworms.
The quality and quantity of silk pro
duced by your silkworms will all de
pend on how you feed them. Too
much food should not be given at once,
but they should never be left entirely
without at any time during the day
or night. You must, therefore, watch
carefully to get an idea of their appe
tite and provide accordingly, says
Home Chat. Fresh mulberry leaved
are the proper food for silkworms, but
If at any time these an not procurable
young lettuce leaves are the best sub
stitute, but thej- are only a stop gap.
Silkworms cannot live for a long pe
riod without their natural food.
h his Bucolic Business.
"That was a perfectly lovely gentle
man I met last night," declared ths>
pretty milliner. "He has a good, reli
able busiuess too."
"What is it?" asked her friend.
"Why, he sells farm Implements,"
continued the pretty girl.
"What kind of farm Implements?"
"Buckets— nothing but buckets. He
told me he kept a bucket shop."—De

Ptouinlncfi.
Ptomaines, according to Quain, are
alkaloids produced by tho decomposi
tion of animal substances. The word
ptomaine was at first restricted to al
kaloids produced by cadaveric decom
position, but it la now also employed
to designate alkaloids of animal origin
formed during life as a result of chem
ical changes induced by some agency
or other acting within the organism.
