A Clever Witness.
At the X. quarter sessions a petty
case was being tried. A' well known
criminal lawyer, who prides himself
upou his skill In cross examining a
witness, had an odd looking genius
upon whom to operate. '

thief?"
"Yes, sir: 'cause why— she confessed
it" ■■ •/■;■■• '- 1
"And . you also swear she was em
ployed by you subsequent to the con
fession?" »i
"I do, sir."
"Then" (giving a sagacious look to
the court) "we are to understand that
you employ dishonest people to work
for" you even after their rascalities are
known?". ' ; ; ■".''. ,) h

Making Alloys 'is an Art.
' Great art is requisite to making al
loys. It is true that they are readily
formed by melting metals together to
a crucible or in properly constructed
furnaces, but it is necessary to Insure
perfect fusion and to prevent loss.
Zinc is a volatile, inflammable metal
and easily catches fire. Indeed it is not
at all uncommon to find that two al
loys of exactly the same component
parts differ very materially in proper
ties to consequence of a difference in
the mode of preparation or in the care
bestowed upon them. . '?. '
A Cariovs Funeral Ceremony.
It is said that when Alaric, the con
queror of Rome, died that "a river was
turned aside to make place in its bed
for his grave and when he was buried
.the water was again let Into its former
channel, and the prisoners who had
helped to bury him were killed so that
no one might find out where the. con
queror of Rome was buried.
The river thus turned was the Busen

Origin of Domesticated Dogs.
The Eskimo dog is derived from the

Itvere trained to serve mankind , were

by the ancient Egyptians which was
evidently obtained by breeding from
slenderly built species that is wild in
Africa at the present time. .

THE ROAD TO DYSPEPSIA.
Why So Many Persons Suffer From
Thla Distressing- Trouble.
It requires about five hours for the
stomach to work on an ordinary meal
and pass it out of itself, when it falls
into a. state of repose; hence If a man
eats three times a day his . stomach
must i work j fifteen hours 'out jof ; the
twenty-f^ourM After & night's sleep we
wake up with a certain amount of bod
ily vigor which Is faithfully portioned
out to every muscle of the system and
every set of muscles, each its rightful
share, the stomach among others.
When the external body gets weary
after a long day's work, the stomach
bears Its share of the fatigue) but If,
when the body Is weary with the day's
toil, we put it to bed, giving .the atom-,
ach meanwhile a five hours' task which
must be performed, ;we impose upon
the very.bes&friend WB t ha."vej-tho one
that gives us one of 'the largest amounts
of earthly enjoyment— and if this over
taxing Is continued It must as certain
ly wear out prematurely as the body
itself will if it is overworked every
day.
And, ' if . persons ' eat between meals,
then the ■ stomach has ! np rest from
breakfast In th,e morning until 1, 2,' 3
or 4 o'clock next day; hence it is that
60 many person^ hafe dyspepsia. The
stomach is worked so much and bo
constantly that it becomes too weak to
work at all.— London Family-Doctor.
Fatten I nar For Murrlmtt.
The marriageable girl in Tunis has a
trying ordeal to go through after her
betrothal to the man not of her choice,
but whose choice she Is. She has to be
fattened to the required size-before the
ceremony can take place. ' ; -•-•■.
As soon as the'betrothal takes place
she is taken to a room and there coop
ed up till the fattening process is con
cluded. Silver shackles are fastened
round her wrists and ankles, and the
task of her parents and future hus
band is to increase her bulk till .her
wrists and ankles fill up the shackles.
If the husband is a widower or has
"discharged" his first wife, the girl has
the shackles of the first spouse placed
on her, and she must fill them out
It takes a long time to do this, as a
rule, 1 and sometimes it cannot be ac
complished In spite of all efforts. It is
then open to the future husband to cry
off the bargain or waive the' condition.
In the case of a bachelor he takes care
to see that the bracelets and anklets
are not too large— that is, if he is fond
of the girl— but If he is being forced
into the marriage by his parents he is
a great stickler for custom. Stout girls
are the more quickly snapped up in
Tunis. ■
A Mark Twain Story.
Two Englishmen were discussing
with Mark Twain the old topic of
American humor as not appreciated by
foreigners. .'"•'"' : . '. . •
"But are the English really so ob
tuse?" asked one of them.
1 "Obtuse! You can't get an Idea into
an Englishman's head with a surgical
operation." declared Mark Twain. - ■ •
The questioner remained in solemn
thought for a moment.' Then he broke
. into a hearty laugh. .. ; '
"Quite a delicious joke!" he exclaim
• cd. "Though of course . if J you were
•to open the Englishman's ' skull you
: would kill him, would you not?" ". "'
Mark Twain turned to the second
Englishman. "What did I, tell you?
He wants to know whether it wouldn't
kill him!" f
The countenance of the second Eng
lishman was like a blank wall.
"Wouldn't it?" he queried.— New York

A party of Englishmen staying in
France went for a drive which extend

still for awhile. Then, with the disr
gusted official looking on, but unable
to interfere, they calmly and deliber

SENSITIVE TO SOUND.
ACUTE POWERS OF HEARING WITH
WHICH FISH ARE ENDOWED. \
■ ■ 1
Some Interesting Experiments That
Were Made to Determine .last What
Manner of .Noises or Motions Would
Startle Trout, -i - '
„ There are . three -'phases of sense in
fisUi particularly, interesting to the an
gler—their exquisite powers of hearing,
of seeing and their subtle, abnormal
sensitiveness to atmospheric influence.
With all our experience and study it is
doubtful if we have arrived at any
thing like a full estimate of the acute
sensitiveness with which fish are' en
dowed. I devote this article to hear
ing. Br hearing I must obviously be
understood to meap their power of ap
preciating the vibration caused by
sound, the conductor being either solid,
aerial or liquid.
In nian sound detonates the eardrum,
and in that way when we are under
water we discover little intelligible
meaning from sounds. But the same
vibrations are undoubtedly received by
the exquisitely sensitive hearing Intel
ligence of a fish, if I may use the
term, ( in a different and far more im
pressive wa j*.- " By intelligence jI j mean
an instinctive* recognition by their
bodies of some disturbance, just as
man recognizes a passing breath of ah*.
It takes the form of feeling.
I came to the conclusion that I
would make a few experiments. Here
are one or two facts: A friend entered
into it with me, and we bethought our
selves of certain well known trout in
our preserve which were "always
there." Then we placed thatched hur
dles a day or two beforehand so that
the fish might get accustomed to them
in such a way that we could approach
close to their haunts without being
seen and watch the unsuspecting trout
through a small hole cut in the straw.
When one was not at borne, the other
generally was. My friend undertook
the noise making, I the observation.
From the sound of a gunshot 500
yards away,' which made our trout dis
tinctly start, to the breaking of a twig
three yards from the fish, which did
the same, we tried all kinds of sounds,
shrill and dull and at varying dis
tances, and the sum of our experiments
convinced us of this: That our sensi
tively organized friends felt the dis
placements of molecules through ether,
which we call sound, and the further
vibrating disturbance through what we
call water, which I verily believe con
ducts sensation to the fish as readily
as glass permits the penetration of
light to' this paper, in proportion to the
distances and the character of the
sound, but that they did hear, or feel
rather, and with incredible quickness,
too, was conclusively demonstrated.
What they heard and were not alarm
ed at I cannot tell, but when they were
alarmed it was evident enough by the
same kind of start they give when their
chief enemy suddenly peeps over the
bank. In only two cases could I dis
cover actual fright, the fright that
sends them down— a gunshot behind
the hurdle and a heavy stamp of the
foot near by. It is noteworthy that the
shrill sounds seemed to startle them
most For instance, a policeman's whis
tle at ten yards sent one out into the
stream as if looking about for some
source of danger, whereas a shout at
the same distance caused no detected
movement Their way of shifting a
little farther from the bank when they
have an inkling of danger is a very
pretty side movement, well known no
doubt It seems for the purpose of
watching the bank at a better angle.
The common manner of showing
their alarm was by a sudden quiver,
sometimes followed by a sinking down
an inch or two, as much as to say,
"What's up?" I very much doubt if I
ever crept up to my peephole without
being detected, and yet I was careful,
for. If you notice, a trout once on the
qul vive gives no sign of alarm at a
second movement or noise. Once pre
pared he is immovable till he suddenly
darts off. You may throw your great
coat at him, and he either braves it stol
idly or bolts cleans away. Five minutes'
perfect stillness and they settle back to
confidence, and then they were again
easily startled. I fancy the laws of re
fraction had something to do with It
and that even from the sky they some
times perceived my movements. I bad
often suspected this before.
I Another conclusion: I believe they
heard much they appeared not to. A
sudden smack of the hands together,
and there was a decided quiver, but a
bird rattle, begun very softly and grad
ually brought up to Its very loudest,
and no notice seemed to be taken. But
doubtless, like ourselves, however loud
the. noise, the gradient robs it of its
startle. However fanciful it may
sound, of this I am thoroughly con
vinced — that water is such an immedi
ate transmitter of vibration to fish that
they recognize sound from the air near
ly as quickly as man. It Is no argu
ment to say we do not when in it We
have no need. Fish have. And be
cause they haye^they are providentially
endowed with super sensitiveness to that
particular nervous influence among
others.— London Field.

FLOATING ISLANDS.
One Island, J Covering Two Aero,
Seen In the GnU Stream.
 Of all , passengers | carried': by . ocean
currents floating islands ore the: most
Interesting. ' Many of them have been
found voyaging on the Atlantic. These
Islands - were ; originally ' parts of
lying river banks which broke away
under stress of storm of j flood and
floated ont to'BearvThe Orinoco, the
Amazon, the La -Plata and other trop
ic:! 1 rivers often send forth such pieces
of their, shores. . , Some r of the bits of
land are of large size and enrry ani
mals. Insects and vegetation, even at
times including trees, the roots of
which serve to hold the land Intact,
while their branches and leaves serve
as sails for the wind.' Generally the
waves break up these Islands shortly
after they put to sea, but sometimes,'
under favorable conditions, they travel
long distances. ', !
The longest voyage of a floating Is
land, according to government records,'
took place In 1893. This island was
first seen off Florida, and apparently It
had an area of two acres. It bore no
trees, but It was thickly covered with
Imshes. and in' one place It was thirty'
feet high above the sea level. ' It was
In the gulf stream, traveling slowly
and with occasional undulations to
show where the ground swell was
working beneath It p Probably It got
away from its river anchorage In the
spring of the year, for toward the lat
ter part of July It had reached the lat
itude of Wilmington, Del.
No large animal life had been seen
on it, though there must have been
myriads of the small creeping things
which abound In the tropics. ! By the
end of August It had passed Cape Cod
and was veering toward the Grand
banks. It followed the steamer lane
routes quite accurately, and several
vessels reported It. One month later
It was in midocean northwest of. the
Azores, and its voyage evidently was
beginning to tell on it. It was tnm-h
smaller and less compact It was not
seen again, and probably it met de
struction in the October gales. But it
had traveled at least 1,000 miles, and
If, as was thought, it came from the
Orinoco, it must have covered twice
that distance.
It Is quite possible that floating is
lands larger than this one. under more
favoring circumstances, might during
past ages have made the complete Jour
ney from America to Europe 6r Africa
and so brought about a distribution of
animal species. Of course it Is not ab
solutely certain that this island went
to pieces In October. It might though
this is not probable, have floated down
into the region of calms and seaweed,
where it would be longer preserved.—
Theodore Waters in Alnslee's. n
THE GOLDEN RULE.
The Golden Rule is worldwide and is
variously voiced as follows:
.Do as you would be done by.—Per
sian. '
• Do not that to a neighbor which you
would take 111 from him.'— Grecian.
What you would not wish done to
yourself do not unto others.— Chinese.
One should seek for others the happi
ness one desires for oneself.— Buddhist
He sought for others the good he de
sired for himself. Let him pass on.—
Egyptian.
All things whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do ye even so to
them.— Christian.
Let none of you treat his brother In
a way he himself would dislike to be
treated. — Mohammedan. . ■ •
The true rule in business is to guard
and do by the things of others as they
do by. their own.— Hindoo.
The law imprinted on the hearts of
oil men is to love' the members of so
ciety as themselves.— Roman.
Whatsoever you do not wish your
neighbor to do to you do not unto him.
This is the whole law. The rest is a
mere exposition of it— Jewish.
They Wanted a Rest.
A Scottish congregation presented
their minister with a sum of money
and sent him off to the continent for a
holiday.
I A gentleman just come from the con
tinent met a prominent member of the
church and said to him:
i "Oh, by the bye, I met your minister
in Germany. He was looking very
well— he didn't look as if he needed a
rest"
• "No," said the church member very
calmly; "it was na' him; it was the
congregation that was needin' a rest"
—Pearson's Weekly.
A Reproof.
"Pa," said Willie, "what .does It
mean to say a man is 'one of nature's
noblemen T "
"'One of nature's noblemen,' my
son," replied the old gentleman, with a
significant look at his better half, "is
a man who smiles when he gets some
ridiculous cheap gift for his birthday
and exclaims: 'How nice! Just what I
wanted!' " — Catholic Standard < and
Times.
The Gums.
Is there a blue line on your gums
near the teeth? Perhaps you are suf
fering from lead poisoning, so attend
to the water pipes, or, If you are a
painter, carefully wash your hands
and clean your nails before eating.
Is there a red line on your gums? Go
to a sanitarium for consumptives or at
least take cod liver oil, open your win
dows night and day and consult a doc
tor.

THE SINFUL BROTHER.
Be Was a Good Baa, bat Didn't Hold
Family Prayers.
• It was at a certain church meeting,
and the good bishop was calling for re
ports. He had a rather stern, sharp
manner which sometimes jarred a little
on the nerves of the more timid. By
and by he came to Brother B, a lay
delegate.
"Brother 8., what is the spiritual con
dition of your church?" demanded the
bishop briskly. v : ■
?I consider It good," said the brother.
"What makes you think It la good?"
went on the bishop.
v "Well, the people are religious. That's
what makes me think so."
"What do you call religious? Do they
have family prayer?" ) '
"Some of them do, and some do not"
1 "Do yoo mean to say that a man may
be a Christian and . not i hold family
"Tes, sir: I think so."
"Do you hold family prayer?"
"Yes, sir," returned the brother quiet
ly- ..' _ , . . .irf,..^..-, :
- "And yet yon think a man may Wa
Christian and not hold family prayer?"
"1 have a brother who Is a ' better
man than I am who does not hold fam
ily prayer."
"What makes yon think he is a better
man than you are?"
"Everybody says so, and I know he
Is." .
"Why does not yoor brother, If he is
such a good man, hold family prayer?"
thundered tbe bishop.
"He has no family," meekly answer
ed the brother.— Harper's. •
The Basking; Shark.
The ferocity of sharks la not necessa
rily In proportion to their size. For ex
ample, there Is the great basking shark,
bo called because of its habit of lying
motionless at the surface of the water.
It often attains a length of nearly forty
feet but its teeth are small compara
tively, and it probably never attacks
man, depending upon small fishes and
Crustacea for lta diet- Another name
for this species is "sail fish," because
of its great back fin, which shows out
of the water like a sail when it Is
basking.
Although sluggish ordinarily and eas
ily harpooned, It exhibits great activity
and enormous strength when struck,
diving immediately to tbe bottom and
requiring a great length of rope to bold

A Revival.
Revivalism in Jamaica has its trage
dies and its comedies, but under no cir
cumstances Its advantages. The excit
ability of the black man Is animal; It
leads him backward toward the jungle,
toward Obeahism. The noisy revival
is tic meeting is a more serious scandal
than a tea party. A doctor told us that
not long since he was called In to a
meeting, where he saw a woman lying
on the ground, while her coreligionists
danced a ketch dance to frantic circle
around her, proclaiming her to be "to
de spirit" He found she was dead
from a fit caused by excitement But
the consequences of these "pious or
gies" may be merely, inconvenient as
In the case of the black lady who when
"to de spirit" climbed upon her neigh
bor's roof and sat there for two days.

The Kid Glove Kid.
The average] kid glove, according to
those who should know, Is not made of
kid at all, but of goat or lamb skin. The
kids from which the real kid glove Is
made are nurtured ' and cared for al
most as carefully, as are race horses.
Most of them are reared in a mountain
ous district of France. The kids are
nourished on milk alone and are never
allowed , to eat : grass, as ~that' would
coarsen the skin. The kid Is kept In a.
pen, where he can recelve.no scratch
or; brulse.° ; They are thus" kept, as it
were, In cotton wool until the age when
the skin Is of most value. They are then
carefully ■ killed and the skin - dressed
with the utmost skill. Sheep, deer and
colts are also pressed Into service for
so called kid and dogskin gloves.
The Potato,
. Humboldt says that at the time of
the discovery of America the potato
was cultivated In all the temperate
parts of South, America -from Chile up
the coast The Spaniards first noticed
it in Peru. The variety of potato culti
vated in Europe and North America
grows wild In Chile. Different species
of the plant are found growing wild In
most parts of South America and. It is
claimed by many botanists, in Mexico
and Arizona.

DIAMONDS.
Catted States Bays , Three-fifths of
World's Output.
■ The world has never seen and in no
other part of the world is there now to
be seen anything like America's Jewel
madness as shown by the conditions of
today, when more than 300 New York
establishments are engaged solely in
the Importation of precious stones,
when agents of American dealers are
ecarcblng ; Europe for the white gem
and hopelessly endeavoring to 'supply
American appeals for rubies and emer
alds and when 6,000 men in South Af
rica • are toiling to ■ obtain diamonds,
more than half of which are to add to
the beauty and happiness of the Amer
ican woman.  . -
It is she that has caused the United
States to become the greatest diamond
market in the world. For her we have
imported in a single year $20,000,000
worth of precious stones, for her at
one period we smuggled them in at the
rate of $7,000,000 a year, for her we
annually buy something like $12,000,-
OOO^worth of diamonds and thus for
her sake heartlessly jj leave of the 1
world's total output of diamonds only
some $8,000,000 worth to satisfy the
vanity of all the rest of the women on
earth.
For her adornment we annually
cause to be brought to this country
diamonds weighing In the aggregate
1,200 pounds, a weight three times that
of the total output of the famous Kini
berley field and practically the equal of
that of tbe whole of South Africa, the
world's greatest diamond mine.— Frank
S. Arnett in Alnslee's Magazine.
Fond of Smoking.
. Smoking In church Is a Dutch cus
tom. Dutchmen are such inveterate
smokers that one of them is rarely
seen without his pipe. He finds him
self unable to deprive himself of the
Indulgence even for the short period
of a church service. A similar practice
exists in several churches in South
America. Smoking In churches In Great
Britain is. said to have been prevalent
at the end of the sixteenth and the be
ginning of -the seventeenth century.
At one time smoking was carried to
such an excess In Seville cathedral that
the chapter applied to the pope for
power to repress the abuse. Urban
VIII., yielding to their wish, Issued a
bull, which was promulgated Jan. 30,
1642. '
In Wales smoking In church was In
dulged in as late as 1850. In one church
the communion table stood In the aisle,
and the farmers were in the habit of
putting their hats upon it, and when
the service began they, lighted their
pipes and smoked, without any thought
of irreverence In the act— Youth's
Companion. .
Cool.
It was in a western hotel. A bellboy
was sent to Colonel William Greene
Sterett's room to ascertain what urgent
need had impelled that gentleman to
push the button. He 'entered and found
the colonel deeply Immersed in a
friendly game with some chosen spir
its.
"Did you ring, sah?" he deferentially
inquired.
"Yes," said Colonel Sterett, deftly
hurling two unpromising pasteboards
into the discard. "We want you to
bring us some whisky. My friends here
will take Scotch, and mine is rye."
% "Yes, sah," said the boy, turning to
go: ■ ;>v; v
"And after you have brought us the
whisky," continued Colonel Sterett, ar
resting his flight "turn In a fire alarm.
Some one in the next room has set the
place afire."— New York Times.
A Way of Cooking Rodents.
The negro slaves of Jamaica used to
regard rats as a dainty, their masters
not . providing them with any other
meat Their method of cooking the
toothsome rodents' was to Impale each
one on a long wooden skewer after
cleaning the animal and cutting off the
tail, turning it briskly around over a
fire until the hah: was all burned off.
Then It was scraped until free from
fur, and finally the end of the skewer
was stuck into the ground, inclined to
ward the fire, until It was toasted dry
and crisp, thus being made ready for
the meal.
The Heart.
That wonderful piece of mechanism,
the heart appears to work continually
day and night from birth to death, but
in reality there are short pauses or
rests between each beat which, though
minute in themselves, mount up In the
aggregate to eight hours out of every
twenty-four. These short pauses ena
ble the heart to repair the waste which
constant work entails and without
.which rests It would break down.
Used to Smoke In Church.
The Bey. Dr. Parr, when perpetual
curate of Hatton, Warwickshire, which
living he held from 1783 to 1790, regu
larly smoked in the vestry while the
congregation were singing long hymns,
chosen for the purpose, immediately be
fore the sermon. The doctor was wont
to exclaim, i'My people like long
hymns, but I prefer a long pipe."— All

Sweet Charity.
Mrs. Gossippe— lt is a positive shame
to see how poorly Mrs. Charitee
clothes her children.
Mrs. Clubb— But you must not forget,
my dear, that her time is so much taken
up .with noble slum work that she has
no time to look after them."— Ohio

AN EXPRESS PACKAGE. '
Wnhr the Shipper Wonld Not Design
nate Its Value.
"What is the value?"" asked an ex
press agent in "a Broadway office of a
keen eyed customer who had handed
him a package to be sent to a western
city. The man addressed did not an
swer at once, but glanced at a printed
card on the wall that reads, "Always
state the value of your shipment" , ■ ■
"If I state the value, will your com
pany pay me that amount in case the
package is lost?' asked the man In his
turn.
"Certainly not, unless that is proved
to be Its value," answered the agent
"If I state the value, can I prove a
greater value If It Is lost?" . . \ ,
"You will have to ask a lawyer that
question," replied the agent
"That isn't necessary, for I happen to
know the law," said the shipper. "Yonr
company is trying to establish an un
fair rule, because M works only one
way. You are right when yon say that
my statement cannot bind yon,' for In
case of loss you can prove the value,
but my. statement would bind' me, for
the court would say that I was 'estop
ped' by my declaration as to the vclue.
'If a shipper should undervalue his
shipment, thinking that thereby he
would reduce the charges, he would
have to stand by his statement and
your notice Is calculated to make him
da that very thing. You can mark my
shipment 'No value stated,' and then if
we meet In the courts it will be on an
equal footing."— New York Herald.
The Miles We Walk.
How many miles a man walks In his
lifetime depends naturally upon how
much he walks a day on the average,
but the man who walks the least cov
ers a vast number of miles before he
dies. Some men walk two miles a day,
some four or five and some as many as
ten. If a man walks two miles a day
and lives to be thirty years old, he will
cover 21,000 miles. At the same age a
man who walks three miles a day will
have walked 32,850 miles. Almost ev
ery man walks between two and three
miles a day v just In going about the
house, the office, the shop, and In going
to and from the cars, etc.
A man who walks five miles a day,
finds that at the age of thirty he 'has
covered 54,750 miles and at the age of
sixty 109,500. From this should, strict
ly speaking, be subtracted the few,
months or a year, when he was a baby,
unable to walk, but the result would
not be affected materially. ;
Now, the circumference of the earth
at the equator Is only 24,899 miles, so
therefore a man who at the age of six
ty has averaged five miles a day since
he was able to walk has walked
enbugb miles to have encircled the
earth four times and have a good
many miles left over toward the fifth
lap.
RAILWAY MAPS.
A Disgruntled Passenger's Comments
on the Straight Line Variety. . '
"Look at that" said an ill natured
passenger, pointing to a large map on*
the wall of the railway station. "Isn't
that an abominable fraud?'
"What's the matter with it?" asked 9
his mild companion.
"Look how it Is distorted," said the,
other. "There is a map of a railway
system from Chicago to New York. It
is made to appear as following a'
straight line between these two cities,
and yet on the map It appears to pass
through every large town within 800
miles of that line.
"Just notice that towns like Cincin
nati and Cleveland are so nfisplaced as
to appear only a few miles apart and
Nashville, Term., is pulled 500 miles
from its real location. I wonder thejj
have not transported New Orleans a
thousand miles northeast, so as to
bring it on the line of their railway
fraud.
"Congress ought to take hold of this
fake," he continued, "and punish heav
ily every railroad that issues a dis
torted map."— Chicago Inter Ocean. I

happening in any part of the county. Our reg
ular correspondents will be furnished with
writing material and stamps for this purpose.

ments, •mining and other industrial progress,

or coming into the county, are always aocept
able. Give details ol important items, no

The Chinese exclusion bill which
had been framed by the western
senators and representatives and'
passed by the house was defeated in
the senate on the 16th inst.', and by
a vote of 48 against 33 the bill of
Plattof Connecticut was substitut
ed. When the substitution had
been made it was supported by all
the senators present except Hoar,
and the vote stood 76 to 1. It will
now go to the house as a new bill
originating in the senate. There is
little doubt of its passing the house,
and while it may be called a com
promise between the extremesis
pro and con, it is far preferable to
no restriction. The Platt measure
provides for the continuation of the
present Geary Act to 1904, and ex
tends the provisions of that law to
all insular territory under the juris
diction of the United States.
Up to this time nothing definite
has been reached in the peace nego
tiations existing between the Brit
ish and the Boers. The St. James
Gazette predicts an early public an
nouncement of the progress of the
peace negotiations. The paper says
there is little doubt that if the Brit
ish and Boers arrive at an under
standing on the main points of the
proposal, peace will ensue, the ban
ishment proclamation will be with
drawn, and minor points like re
stocking the farms, will be referred
— to a board composed of British and
Boer representatives. It is believed
that discord exists between the
British cabinet and Lord Milner,
the British High Commissioner in
South Africa, over the terms for ob
taining peace, proposed by Lord
■ Milner. There is good reason to be
lieve that the Boers are vigorously
demanding a representative govern
ment, which demand is opposed with
equal vigor by the British repre
sentatives.
Bad Break in the Bitch.
Last Friday a break occurred in the
old ditch of the Standard Electric
Company, causing considerable incon
venience and expense. The water had
been turned into the Page reservoir,
preparatory to running it into the Ta
beaud lake through the new waste
gate. Owing to the location of the
Page reservoir and the character and
formation of the earth and rock in
which it is built, some doubt has ex
isted in the minds of the engineers as
to the ultimate success of confining: the
water at that place. These conditions
however could .be ascertained only
after the work had been done and the
experiment tried.
When the water was first turned in
some trouble was caused, but the dam
age was repaired and a further test
was required. Accordingly the gate
above was again opened, allowing the
reservoir to fill. Friday the hillside
on the south gave way above the ditch
which supplies the old plant and the
New York Ranch reservoir, carrying
away the ditch for a distance of four
hundred feet. A force of carpenters
were set to work immediately fluming
the break, the work being rushed with
all possible speed, being completed the
following Tuesday. In this space of
time the old plant was forced to close,
and the water supply on the Sutter
creek side fell off considerably, causing
one of the mines to prepare for steam
power. On Tuesday the -water was
again running in the old ditch as usual.
A flume is now being run through the
Page reservoir to the head of the pipe
line, and the company will soon test
the big plant.

Decided Against the Heir.
Judge Buck has granted letters of
administration to Public Administrator
C. C. Franklin in the estate of W. R.
Williams, deceased. There was a con
test for the letters. A. B. Richards, a
nephew of the deceased, and who had
been assigned a ono-sixth interest in
the estate, filed a protest against the
appointment of the public adtntpistra
tor and petitioned for letters himself.
In deciding the contest Judge Buck
said: "it seems clear from the statute
that the legislature has declared it to
be the public policy of this state in
the granting of letters of administra
tion to prefer the public administra
tor .to any relative, no matter how
close his relationship, provided such
relative is not entitled to succeed to
the decedent's personal estate or not
entitled to share in the distribution . of
the estate, in the absence, of course of
the statutory nominations."— Record

There is more Catarrh in this sec
tion of the country than all other dis
eases put together, and until the last
few years was supposed to be incur
able. For a great many years doctors
pronounced it a local disease, and pre
scribed local remedios, and by constant
ly failing to cure with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable. Science has
proven catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti
tutional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
Cure, manufactured by F. J. Cheney
& Co., Toledo, Ohio, is the only const
itutional cure on the market. It is
talten internally in doses from 10 drops
to a teaspoonful. ' It acts directly on

for any case it fails to cure. Send for

Accident at a Mine.
At the Defender mine last week, says
the .Calaveras Chronicle,, an accident
occurred which came very noar costing
two men their lives. Walter Wickham
and James Lunt, upon finishing their
shift, were going up on the skip to the,
surface. Just as the skip reached the
collar of the shaft and the men were
about to step olf, the cable slipped the
reel and down skip and men went to
ward the center of the earth at an
alarming rate. The men thought they
were "goners" as three hundred feet of
perpendicular space were between them
and the bottom of the shaft. To their
good fortune, however, the slack of
the cable caught on a set-screw and
stopped the downward move. As it
was they only went down about twenty
feet, but that was enough to give them
a number of bruises about the arms
and back, besides a bad scare.

NOTICE-^ rf 1 .
When you are about to buy a suit
of clothes, it would be absurd to go
to a carpenter's shop. When, in
need of medicine, you would not, call
on the blacksmith to prescribe for
you. To reasonable people it will
appear, that to buy a suit there is
but one place, and. that is the tailor
shop, where your suit can be iitted
on you before being made up; and
where you can select your goods,
not from a piece of scrap on paper,
where in nine cases, out of ten when
your suit arrives it isn't at all what
you selected. If you buy it home
you can select your goods from a
large assortment of piece goods, and
can soe what you are getting for
your money. Your ready made
suits are pressed and remodeled with
no e^tra charge; this I guarantee.
Remember mine is the only place in
Jackson where you- can have this
done free of charge." ■
Have. just received a brand new
line of spring and summer goods all
ready made and to be made up to
order. Men's, Youth's and child-
ren's clothing of the latest styles.
Trusting to receive a call from
you, and thankiug you for your past
favors, and soliciting the same in
the future,
Max Ladar, the Tailor.

at the mine, returning Monday even

P. H. Cunningham of New Castle, Pa.,
and a gentleman from Yreka, who went
up to examine the property and enjoy
the mountain air and scenery. Mr.
Cunningham is a large stockholder in
the company, and returned highly
pleased with the prospects seen. Mr.
Wright reports that the machinery is
being installed as rapidly as possible.
It is now all on the grounds, and Mr.
V. S. Garbarini is there in charge of
the necessary construction work. The
drills are expected to be at work within
two weeks, operating upon the cross
cut tunnel with compressed air power.
The Economic Gas Engine.
E. H. Schmitz of Sutter Creek, for
merly connected with the*' telephone
company, has secured the agency for
the Economic Gas Engine. This is
said to be just the thing where cheap
power is needed, combined with effic
iency. The cost of running is said to
be only one-third that of gasoline or
electricity or water. This fact must
recommend it as worthy of attention
by tljose needing power. Crude oil is
the fuel used, and the cheapness ,. of
this material, as compared with other
fuel, explains the immense difference
in running expenses. Mr. Schmitz has
only taken hold of the matter a few
days, and is meeting with substantial
encouragement, as the merits of this
engine is explained. We are informed
that the county rock breaker, which
takes at least $3 worth of gasoline per
day to operate it for eight hours, could
be operated by this engine at less than
51. 50. ' Every person using power
should look into this oil usiqg engine.
It means a saving of money. See ad
in another column.
The Band. Dance . a Success.
"A most enjoyable "party" was the
verdict of those who attended ■ the
dance given by the Jackson Band last
Saturday evening in Love's hall. The
ladies, especially, were out ! in large
numbers, and bedecked with fine rai
ment, presented a very attractive ap
pearance. The music furnished by the
band came in for just praise from the
dancers, and at the conclusion of the
dance many expressed the wish that
the band would soon "do it again."
The receipts were gratifying to the
members of Jackson's excellent musi
cal organization, sufficient funds being
taken in to buy a lot of new music and
meet other necessary expenses.

A MOST DARING HOLD-UP
Lone Bobber Holds Up Pic-
cardo's Saloon.
Gets Only $25 in Cash— A Couple of
Shots Fired at Intruder, Who
is Certainly Wounded. .
One of the most, daring attempts in
the highwayman line that has occurred
In this county for many years, took
place Friday evening of last week at
Pii:cardo's Baloon, on the road to Jack
son Gate. It was in the early part of
the evening, shortly after 8 o'clock.
The saloon was filled with people; at
least 8 persons were congregated there.
At the hour named a medium sized
man stepped into the room at a brisk
walk, having a black cloth masking
his face, and- wearing a long linen
duster. He walked lnt» the middle of
the saloon, holding an ugly looking
pistol in his hand, and having a spare
gun sticking out from a belt that
girdled his waist. It was evident that
he was a road agent that meant busi
ness. Ho covered A. Piccardo with his
gun, and kept his eye on Louis Pic
cardo, and commanded them in em
phatic language to throw up their
hands, which of course they, all did.
He then commanded all except Piccardo
and his son, to get into the cellar, or
room behind the saloon. One of the
company was a new comer from Sunny
Italy, and was not sufficiently posted
in English to understand his command.
He therefore, unwittingly hesitated,
when the intruder gave him a kick,
which had the effect of hurrying his
exit. Tho stranger next ordered Pic
cardo and Louie in the office, and when
there he told them to "open the safe,
and be quick about it." The safe
was not locked. So the front door was
thrown open, but the inside portion
was locked, and Piccardo was in no
hurry to find the keys. The' robber
was nervous at the delay. He ordered
Piccardo to hand over the cash he had
about him, also the contents of the till;
altogether he corralled about $25, and
thereupon turned to leave the place.
Now Louie Piccardo kept a shotgun
in the corner of the office. It was not
in view of the robber as he stood at the
office door, and he was evidently
ignorant of its presence there.. It was
not loaded, but there were a number of
loaded shells close by, loaded with No.
6 bird shot. Louie seized the gun as
soon as the man's back was turned ,
and slipped a couple ot shells In, and as
the robber had just got to the front
door, about 40 feet away, fired both
barrels in quick succession. The free
booter fell just as he got through the
door. He got up instantly, however,
and made his escape. A pistol—be
lieved to be the one he carried in his
belt — was picked up, where he fell.
Also an old black felt hat, with the
lining all torn out, was found about one
hundred feet from the front door, on
the road toward Jackson Gate. A
man who lives just beyond Piccardo's,
and who keeps an electric light in
front of his premises, says he saw a
man examining himself by means of
the light. It was no doubt the robber,
trying to size up his damage.
The shots shattered the lower pane
of glass in each door. Shot marks are
visible from below the glass to the top
of the doors. How the shot came to
scatter so widely in so short a distance,
is explained by some on the theory that
some of the shot struck the pistol the
man held in his hand, and deflected,
some upward and some downward, ac
cording to the upper or lower part of
the barrel strucs. From this it la in
ferred that the bandit did not escape
without carrying some small shot with
him. Indeed, it was utterly impossible
for him to have escaped being hit if he
was in the doorway when the shots
were fired. No blood, however, could
be found anywhere. If struck at all,
it was in the lower part of the body,
and might not interfere with his flight.
The officers were promptly notified,
and started out to hunt up clews.
The search was continued through
the night, all day Saturday, and ' Sat
urday night, but nothing of importance
was found. On Sunday a linen duster,
ragged and torn, with a hole shot
through the left side of it, made by the
discharge of a shotgun, a belt and pis
tol holster, also riddled by fine shot,
and a large pistol were found hidden in
the skip at the Bellwether mine. Con
siderable blood ' stains were found on
the duster, indicating that the robber
was pretty badly wounded. The
search was continued with renewed
vigor, but up to this time nothing of
importance has been found. The man
seems to have disappeared as mysteri
ously as he came, i

been offered that said sprinkler proV
cure a nozzle to attach to the hose,

enough to create mud holes, but just
sufficient to allay the dust. The
method heretofore prevailing of mak
ing the streets sloppy, works almost as
much inconvenience as dust, ai the
mud is tracked by pedestrians into
stores and houses, and In a short . time
dries and flies over everything.
The Buy Bees aad XcCatcneos.
Jack McCutcheon, in charge of the
Jackson Shoe Store, when It comes to
fitting and selling those necessary arti
cles of wearing apparel has no peer,
but what he knows of that industrious
little insect called the bee would prob
ably take our young friend but a short
time to tell. Sunday evening a swarm
of bees lit on a tree opposite Casslnelli'a
fruit store. Jack procured a box and
an old broom, and endeavored to sur
round and herd them into it, but his
plans would not work, owing to the
fact that many of the bees introduced
their warm end to Jack's anatomy,
with the result that he retreated . and
gave up the job. One of his eyes looked
like it had been bit with a sledge ham
mert The bees, tiring of the location
near the above mentioned store, left
there Monday, going to an electric
light pole directly in front of the Jack
son Shoe Store, and there waited con
siderable time for McCutcheon to take
them in, which he did, with the
assistance of a small boy.

have* the heartfelt sympathy. of all.
. IN MEMORY Of JIM. •
Ah me 1 in a darkened chamber,
With the sunshine shut away.
Through tears that fell like a bitter rain.
Our darling little Jim lay that day .
And the little bare feet that were dimpled
And sweet as a budding rose,
.Lay side by aid* together, ■ . .
In a hush ol a long repose. ■ '
Upborn the dainty pillow,
white aa the risen dawn.
The fair little face lay smiling.
With the light of heaven thereon;
And the dear little hands, like rose leaves
Dropped from a rose, lay still,
Never to snatch at the sunshine
That crept to the shrouded sill.
And out of the darkened chamber
We went with a childless moan.
To the height of the sinless angels
Our Uttle Jim had gone. :~r. ...

RUSHING BUSINESS.
One of Jaekion's Leading Stores Breaks
tb.« Boeord of Many Tears.
The clerks at The Red Front have
been quite busy since Saturday last, on
account of their annual clearance sale.
The Red Front, which is established
in this town for the past 8 years,
through fair and square dealing with
the public has gained a reputation as
one of the best, cheapest, and most
reliable stores of Amador county. Like
in the past, they announced this year
their regular annual clearance sale
which was to commence on Saturday,
April 12th. On that day, from early
In the morning till late In th« night,
people crowded the store. They have
sol 4 from 11 o'clock a. m. till 4 o'clock
p. tn., more clothing than in the last 2
months. There was a big rush after
the advertised bargains, which it is
said were exactly as stated. This sale
brought the best results ever since
they are in business.
The >ale is still going on,' and ac

W. A. Bennetts and daughter of
lone, paid Jackson a short visit Thurs
day evening. Mr. Bennetts will start
Saturday on a trip to Stanstall, Eng
land, the place of his birth, and where
his step-mother now lives. He came
to Amador City in 1866, and worked
for several years in Aaron Weil's store.
From there he went to lone, ' into the
employ of D. Stewart, and has been
connected with the Stewart store con
tinuously for twenty -six years as book
keeper and salesman. When the
Stewart Company was organized after
the death of D. Stewart, Mr. Bennetts
was elected manager, which position he

Nome and Its Concomitants.
It is natural for human beings when
hearing of some place they have not
seen to draw a mental picture of it, and
people it according to its note. The
farther it is away, the greater the
place grows in mental importance.
Sometimes they see it raising its walls
in stupendous grandeur, and then they
paint in gorgeous colors and people it
with figures, and even raise it into god
heads surpassing in conception features
in both man and mansion,' unique, curi
ous, grotesque, and fanciful. Had the
excavation of Pompeii and Herculan
eum begun in the year following that
of 79, passing into that century the
matter developed would have hardly
excited curiosity, but as it has lain
silent and still for a little more than
eighteen hundred years its interest in
creased in proportion with the decay
ing centuries, and has become' the fic
tion of fact and the curio of fanciful
expectation. Man's mind is prone to
grasp, bold, and shelter theories mold
ed into fancies so extravagant and
erroneous as to create a glamoring im
pression in the human j mind, carrying
it away in ecstasy of fictitious delight,
but- when the real comes, which' it
often does, how strange the difference.
The place that sprang into being
through the conception of the ideal
crumbles from stupendous grandeur
and drops with a crash into the ruins
of commonalty. - *- V. '
The gorgeous picture they have
drawn in their mental vision fades like
a glamoring shadow away. Upon this
mental theordrical hypothesis, mental
pictures of land of the midnight sun
becomes erroneous, extravagant, ridic
ulous, and imperfect. To know is to
see, to see is to illustrate, then all
guess work passes into shadowy realms
of its own, and certainty stands' eman
cipated as a fact before you. Nome
then, to those far off, is the ideal
Golconda of wealth and magnificence,
but when you stand in the streets of
the city itself the fairy picture you
have molded in your Imagination be
comes a vaccum of incongruity and
stands haggard and j grotesque ' before
you. The place you see is cosmopoli
tan, for every shade of humanity is
represented therein. The latin race,
dark and sinuey, permeates this mass
of varied humanity. The Scandinavi
ans find a habitation similar to that of
their own. The Laplander habited in
their pinkish blouse coming only to
their knees, below which is a skin
tight arctic stocking, Liliputan in
stature, and wearing a jaunty red cap,
make them the target of jest and the
cynosure of all eyes. As they go along
the streets carrying a great load upon
their backs, supported by a head strap,
and bending under the weight, a curi
ous crowd gaze at them with all the
curiosity of a person viewing mon
strosities of a passing menagerie. The
Esquimaux is so common on the streets
that they fail to attract attention.
They vend their merchandise along the
city thoroughfare, and go with a swag
gering, unconcerned gait, and with
that nonchalance of all curiosity as if
they had lived a lifetime amid the curi
ous charms of civilization. Their type
in facial mold Is Japanese, and when
they dress In American fashion, as they
sometimes do, so similar would they
appear that you would not know with
out being told but what it were a Jap
anese standing or walking before . you.
Like the reindeer they are gregarous
in character. In summer they live
under their inverted walros skin beats
that carry them from place to place on
the sea, and shelter them from the fall
ing rain upon the land. In winter they
live In engloos, ] which are excavated
houses, with entrances enclosed almost
hermetrically, shutting out the cold
winds that sweep from the Arctic sea
with penetrating deadly ' force. Com
ing from their engloos habited in furs
when the thermometer is 50 or 60
below zero, they go in search of the
walros, and when they return they
dive again into their abode, leaving
the icy wind that has fanned them for
hours and the sudden change, too often
produce pulmonary diseases, destruc;
tion and death. So rapidly is death
following their footsteps that a decade
or two more will mark them' with the
last of the Mohegans.
Nome supports no superb buildings.
From the ordinary building it drops
into shacks, and ends in canvas tents.
So deep is the mud in places that it
renders disgust, and merges on to the
ridiculous. In passing along the
streets— if I am permitted to use a
misnomer — back from Stedman Avenue
I came upon a new wagon almost out of
sight in mud,' four or five inches of. the
upper portion of the wheels projected.
A play card fluttered above it, held by
a twine string, and reading, "Claim
this wagon by right of discovery."
Only when the winter winds sweep
with icy breath, bringing the ice and
freezing the surface of the ground, is
Nome in all its glory. Then pedes
trians with bradded boots or shoes go
in safety everywhere, without danger
of dropping to their waist in mud.
Nome sports a railroad of the reduced
pattern. It is known as the Wild
Goose railroad and runs from the Spit
on the west side of Snake river to
claim No. 7on Anvil creek. Passenger
rates are $1, and freight $40 per ton.
Financially it is a success, but in com
parison of railroads in general, it
dwindles into utter insignificance.
When I first saw it, it made me think
of an incident of travel in 1875. I was
on the southbound train going to Los
Angeles. There were no sleepers on
the train and passengers could either
stay awake or sleep as best they could.
It was 12 o'clock at night, and I was
dozing in my seat. I was suddenly
awakened by the hoarse voice of the
conductor saying: "If you want to go
to Los Angeles stay on this train, that
horse car there goes to Visalia." I
looked up and saw an old man and
woman standing beside the conductor
abashed and disappointed. We were
at Goshen junction, and I smiled as I
looked at the small pattern of an en
gine and passenger car standing on the
Vlsalla track. It was so small as It
stood beside our panting monster that
for an Instant I imagined it an infant
Quadruped following its mother. Such
then is the Wild Goose railroad.

Mrs. Phillips was raising six young
puppies. One day when feeding them I
she said to me: ."This is my pin money.
At 9 months old I'll get $60 apiece for;
these pups." That beats chicken rais
ing in comparison of profits. ' So my
lady friends of California will be
obliged to doff their hats to the women
of Nome. Lawyers are thicker than l?
priests in Rome. There are close to a
hundred of them. I heard it stated
that over one hundred saloons were in'
Nome. Among ' the greater are the
Hub, Second Class, Hunter, Waldrof,
El Dorado, and Madden House. Last
summer Main street was planked, '
which made a decided improvement
thereon. To see is to know, and the
ideal of Nome is before you.

FROM DEFENDER.
Defender, April 15.— 1t is reported
that the Catherine and Belmont mine
will start up before the first of May.
Both have been good bullion producers
in the past.
Wm. Marchand and '. his bride (Miss
Louise Westfall) have returned from
their honeymoon, which was spent in
San Francisco with the groom's mother .
Will is receiving . congratulations from
his many friends in this section.
J. T. Chase of Clinton Bar was in
Defender early in the week looking
after his mining-interests here. :
The Defender mine is keeping up its
past record of bullion production, and
has its stamps dropping day and night
on $20 ore.
One of Defender's society young men
while out walking with his best girl
was the recipient gf . a very cruel acci
dent. He had a pioneer lantern in his
hand, and being busily engaged talk
ing to his betrothed, dropped the can
dle out of his improvised lantern and
never discovered its loss until his ar
rival at home.
A birthday party. was given last Sat
urday evening at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. R. H. A. Burbank at Antelope,
in honor of their daughter, Miss Delia
Burbank. Music, dancing and games
were indulged in until the wee small
hours. Among those present were:
Mr. and Mrs, Al. Lehn, Mr. and Mrs.
S. Lessley, Mrs. N. H. Lessley, Mr. and
Mrs. H. Wilson, Mr. and Mrs. J. Camp
bell; Misses Mabel Wilson, Edith Less

Annual Celebration.
lone Lodge No. 51, I. O. O. F., will
hold their annual picnic at lone on
April 26th in honor of the 89th anni
versary of Oddfellowship. The officers
of the day are: Grand marshal, M.
Nixon of Sutter Creek; president of
the day, E. A. Freeman of Jackson;
orator, L. L. Alexander of San Fran
cisco; chaplains, Revs. S. H. Wheeler
and W. C. Howard. It is the earnest
endeavor of those in charge that this
picnic will surpass everything in the
past, and as a step in that direction a
number of special features will be intro
duced, the most important of which
will be the ascension of Prof. Pell's
modern airship at 7p. m.' This is not
a balloon, but a dirigible airship in.
which the inventor will sail directly to
San Francisco in the shortest time that
the ground has ever been covered.
The lone Brass Band will entertain the
people in its usual excellent style. In
the afternoon there will be many
amusements on the streets. Mrs>
Katzenjammer will be present with her
kids; Alphonse and Gaston will illus
trate 30th century politeness, and
Happy Hooligan's band will play a
"Hot time." The day will conclude
with a grand ball in the pavilion.

HE WAS EXCUSED.
But the Talesman Bungled His Ex-
cuse For Evading Jury Duly.
A young man whose features and
flashing eyes betokened great earnest
ness was summoned before a judge of
the city court the other day for jury
duty. He immediately asked to be ex
cused. When the ' Judge asked, him
what excuse he had for not serving, he
replied: , a
■ "I believe it Is a rule of the court
that the jury Is the sole Judge of the
facts and the court of the law— that
the juror should only weigh the facts
as presented by the evidence, not tak
ing into consideration any of the rules
of law governing the case,- wherefore
all lawyers are exempt from jury
duty."
"But are you a lawyer?" asked the
judge.-
"No, but I have been a close student
of the law for many years."
"I am afraid that I cannot excuse
you if you are uot a lawyer," said the
court, smiling.
"But" continued the young man,
with great earnestness, the color
mounting to his temples, "I am sure if
your honor knew as much law as I do
your conscience would not allow you to
serve on a Jury."
After the bench and bar had recov
ered from this naive outburst the
Judge told the young man that if it
was a matter which affected his con
science so deeply he would excuse him,
and a very much abashed youth left
the courtroom. — New York Times.
Roosting? Comfortably.
"It want warm, but it was peace
ful," says the man who lived In the
chicken barn because his wife's rela
tives lived in the house. Thus the sat
isfaction of the mind transcends in im
portance the mere comforts of the
fcody.— New York World.

• With f the [ First. '"■■■'• *
A young. man was telling anecdotes
to a circle, and one of his listeners waa
his mother-in-law. . He - related one
about a funeral. A woman had died.
The undertaker at the. close of the
services at the house said to the be
reaved husband:
"You will ride In the first carriage
"with your mother-in-law."
: "I decline to ride wlth'that woman,"
said the widower. "She has made my
life miserable. To ride, with her would
spoil all the pleasure of the occasion."
. All laughingly appreciated the hu-
r mor of the story except the young
man's mother-in-law.
"Why don't you laugh V he asked.
"It was a good story." ,
"Oh." she replied, "I was thinking of
another story about a colored minister
who prayed one day for rain like this:

How to Make Tonmelf Invisible.
Purchase a new pot, ' dish, mirror,
agate, steel and tinder. "Convey" a
black cat— a dead one will i do. At the
stroke of midnight fill your pot at the
fountain, light a fire and put the pot
on it. Place the cat in the pot and bold
the lid on with your left hand. Remain
for twenty-four hours in this" position
without i.iovin™. speaking, eating or
drinking and be. especially 'careful not
to look behind ' you whatever noises
you may hear.
At tbc end of this time take off the
pot and place the contents on the new
dish. Separate the flesh of the cat
from the bones and throw the former
over your left shoulder, saying, "Ac
clpe quod tlbl do, et nihil amplius."
Then place each bone in succession be

Odors and Disease*.
. The Medical Record Is, authority for
the statement that the 'odor of new
mown hay Is an indication of pyrcsnla,
typhus is indicated by -an ammoniac
smell, jaundice by a musky one, yel
low fever by the odor of a bun barrel,
liysterla by a suggestion of .violets or
pineapples, intermittent fever by the
smell of fresh baked brown, bread and
measles by one like fresh picked feath
ers.
' In cholera the odor of thetskln)ls am
moniacal. It is acid In what Isjcalled
milk fever, acetoformic tin rheuma
tism, particularly In thetregion tof the
engorged articulations; of new! baked
bread in scarlatina. In smallpox the
odor is that of the fallow deer;«ln ty
phoid fever it is that of blood.
It seems somewhat Incongruous -that
the smell vof the plague resembles
honey. *
How Bay Run Is Made.
, Bay rum is manufactured in Domin
ica from the dried leaves of Pimenta
acris. Bay rum is procuredjby distilla
tion and this in a very slritple manner.
The leaves are picked from the trees
and then dried. In this state they are
placed in the retort, which is then
filled with water, and the process .of
distillation is Carried on. The vapor l Is
then condensed in the usual way aad
forms what is known as "bay oil," a
very small quantity of which Is re
quired for each punctieon of rum. Tjhe
manufacture of bay rrum is carried Jon
at the 1 northern end" of Dominica and
proves a very lucrative business »tb
those engaged in it, as the plants are
plentlf ul to this district.

DOCTOR AND PATIENt.
It Ik Not Always Profitable to Tell
the Plain Truth.
As a rule you can never take a wom
an at her word. A Louisville woman
and her husband went east for recu
peration. It was their intention to in
terview a leading physician before
they, came back, in | order, to get his
opinion of the wife's health. She had
beiMi far from well and finally conclud
ed nothing would satisfy her but the
Tcrdict of this medical celebrity. '
Accordingly husband and wife called
by i appointment ..upon j this specialist.
"Now. doctor," said the woman, . '*I
want your honest opinion. I like canr
dor and don't wish to make the trip
here to be told any falsehood ' about
myself."
Tliis sounded very open and courage
ous, so the expert went to work. He
looked at her well, asked questions,
made a minute examination of the
case' and finally inquired, "Did any
doctor ever tell you you had so and
SOT' ' ; !;r ■:•.•: •■: ■• I I V. -
■ ! "Only one— the horrid brute!" was
the reply. "I have been to ten or
twelve, and he was the only one who
was so Ignorant and rude as to tell me
such a thing, and I discharged him at
once." .. ,
"Discharged hlni!" exclaimed the ex
pert "Why. madam, he was the only
one of the lot who told you the truth."

Fresh 'Water Sponges.
. That certain. sponges can do a great
deal of hnnn Is. now. maintained by a
French scientist. According to him, the
water supply of some cities and towns
has been polluted by them, and the wa
ter supply of others may. be polluted if
steps are not taken to prevent it. ■
■ Sponges of .this kind are found only
in fresh. water and are known as "cor
nacuspongice." A close examination
shows that each of the . various parts
of such a sponge is composed of three
layers. First, there is a flattened layer
of epithelial cells, which covers the
outer surface; next, there Is a digestive
layer of cells,; each of which\is sur
rounded by a collar, , from which pro
jects a little thong or whip, and, finally,
between these two there is a third lay
er, containing the reproductive cells as
well as the spicules and fibers which
form the skeleton. ' '■' •'
In some sponges the spicnles are com
posed of silica and in others of calcium
carbonate. ," . . •; ■ .• • fc ■
After some time sponges of this type
decay, and If the water Inhabited by
them is used for- drinking purposes the
pollution caused by them is likely, ac
cording to the French scientist; to
prove | injurious to the public health,
and therefore he recommends that the
water be cleared of such sponges wher
ever it is possible to do so.
i There ' are sponges of this kind in
many rivers and ponds in this country*
Mosart and Beethoven.
The stories of how men of genius
have had future fame predicted for
them in their early youth must gener
ally be taken with a considerable grain
of salt. As authentic as most is the
account of the first meeting of Mozart
with the young Beethoven, which took
place on the letter's first visit to Vien
na in the year 1787. Mozart, then at
the height of his fame, asked him to
play, but, thinking his performance
a prepared piece,. paid little attention
to it. Beethoven, seeing this, entreated
Mozart to give him a subject, which he
did, and the boy, getting excited with
the occasion, played so finely that the
composer of "Don Giovanni," stepping
softly into the next room, said to his
friends there: "Pay 'attention to him.
He will make a noise in the' world
some day or another."— Chambers'
Journal.
Oar Surprising Sunflowers.
Few people in England, remarks a
London paper, who grow the sunflow
er for ornament have any idea of its
usefulness. And then it proceeds thus
to describe the sunflower on its native
heath In the United States:
So rich is this plant In oil that the
seed of one of these monster plants
will yield fifty gallons of oil, while the
refuse of the seed after this quantity
of oil has , been expressed' weighs
1,500 pounds when made Into cattle
cakes. . . ' v
Three Classes.
Henry Thomas Buckle's thoughts and
conversation were always on a high
level. Once he remarked: .
"Men and women range themselves
Into three classes or orders of Intelli
gence. Yon can tell the lowest class by.
their habit of always talking about
persons, the next by the fact that
their habit is always to converse about
things, the highest by their preference
for the discussion of ideas." '

The Scorpion's Wonderful Ear.
I have studied the habits of the scor
pion for many years and have often
noticed how very sensitive scorpions
arc to the most delicate sound, musical
or otherwise. Under the thorax the
scorpion has two comblike . append
ages, which are the antennas (pecti
natK). It is pretty well settled by
physiologists and entomologists that in
Insects the antenna? represent the or
gans of hearing. These delicate struc
tures are easily affected by the vibra
tions of sound, and there can be no
doubt whatever that they, are also af
fected by sounds quite inaudible to the
human ear. ' .' ' ,■
z The slightest vibration of the atmos
phere from any cause whatever at once
puts in motion the delicate structures
which compose* the antennae, to which
organs Insects ■ owe the power' of pro
tecting themselves against danger as
well as the means of recognising the
approach of one another.— London
Spectator. 
Railway* In Argentina.
"The railway system of Argentina,"
"says a correspondent of the London
Post, 'is second to none In the world.
Trains run at frequent intervals and
punctually, especially the long distance
trains. The rolling stock Is excellent,
and a long distance Journey by rail is a
luxury. The sleeping cars are sumptn
ously appointed, the permanent ways
are well laid, and there is consequently
very little Jolting. It is possible to
breakfast or dine in the trains as com
fortably as in a hotel. The dining cars
are well fitted up and beautifully deco
rated with flowers and pot plants. The
food is properly cooked and tastefully
served at any hour of the day or night,
and, above all, the charges are . ex
traordinarily low. Fares, too, are very
low, so that traveling is an easy and a
cheap matter."
Horseshoe Nail Rings.
Finger rings made of horseshoe nails!
They are certainly not pretty or grace
ful, j but they are said to bring good
luck to the wearer on certain condi
tions. ' ' ' : '
To be a genuine charm the ring must
be made from a nail taken from a
horseshoe found by the owner herself
and nobody else. \ This Is taken to a
Jeweler, who bends it to fit her little
finger and cuts off the superfluous
length. ' ' •
I The ring is not welded together, and
the head of the nail stands for the set
ting. There's no way of proving it, but
those who have adopted these orna
ments say that they bring just as much
luck as a horseshoe itself hung over the
door with ends up.— New York Herald.
The Rosemary at a Wedding;.
In the island of Crete, it is said, a
bride ! dressed for the wedding still
calls, last of all, for a sprig of rose
mary to bring her luck. Thus we come
to . find- rosemary in close association
with both marriage and death, just as
the hyacinth was, and perhaps still is,
among the Greeks. It Is interesting to
trace the connection by. which the
same plant came to have two such dif
ferent uses.— All the Year Round. :
The Color of the Eye.
The color of the iris Is not uniform In
any eye. Some eyes have spots, others
stripes, still others blotches of white,
green, blue, yellow and black, and the
eye takes Its color from the predomi
nance of one hue. An eye that is con
sidered gray will often be composed of
black and > yellow. An eye that Is
thought to be brown will be very dark
red, with spots of yellow or blue.
