NOTABLE MAN HUNTS
HOW CRIMINALS HAVE BEEN CHASED
TO THE ENDS OF EARTH.
Benson, Who Posed, as Hue. Patti's
Agent, Cheated Justice by Death.
Relentless Energry of the Police In
Tracking; Counterfeiters.
There have been many long pursuits
of criminals, great in the distance trav
eled, the obstacles overcome and the
persistence of the pursuing officers, but
that of Sergeant «Wood of the Natal
(South Africa) police Is doubtless a
record breaker. The man sought by
Sergeant Wood was charged with em
bezzling . large sums of money at Pie
termaritzburg. He got away from
South Africa and went to New York.
'Although the detective had informa
tion as to where his quarry was hid
ing, yet he had first to visit London to
obtain the necessary extradition pa-,
pers. Then he hurried to America and
with the assistance of the United States
police ran down his man. By the time
he bad reached Maritzburg he had been
traveling hard for nearly three months
and had covered nearly 21,000 miles.
One of the sternest chases of recent
years was after Loys Darrell, formerly
sergeant In the Seventh United States
cavalry. Darrell enlisted at the begin
ning of the Spanish- American war and
distinguished himself at Cuba. There
he fell in love with a pretty Spanish
girl and beggared himself In buying
finery for his sweetheart To obtain
more money he robbed and murdered
a companion in arms named Crouch.
He then fled.
A detective named Dupuy was put
upon the murderer's track and, finding
a clew, started for New Orleans. .He
■was right in his surmise that Darrell
had gone there^but when he arrived
the bird had flown, klle had left on a
British mule transport for South Afri
ca. Dupuy took train for New York,
fast boat for Southampton, rushed by
rail across Europe, caught a boat of
the German East African line and
finally arrived at Belra, In Portuguese
East Africa.
There he waited like a spider for a
fly, and just as Darrell was fancying
himself safe from pursuit be pounced
upon him. Later on the detective de
posited his prisoner safely In Castle
William Jail in New York. He had
traveled in all 31,000 miles and spent
$1,250 In the chase.
One of the most astonishing crim
inals England ever produced was a
man named Benson, who began oper
ations in London with two confeder
ates. He organized a series of swin
dling companies In the city, while he
himself, pretending to be an Invalid,
lived in the greatest luxury In the Isle
of Wight. He posed as a great phi
lanthropist, was foremost in charitable
works and went Into the very best
society. By dint of bribing certain
officers of the law he lived for some
years on the proceeds of his swindles.
But one day the crash came. He was
arrested, sentenced and got a long term
In Portsmouth jail.
No sooner was be out than he was at
lils old tricks again. These culminated
In Switzerland, where he managed to
gain the affections of the daughter of
an English officer. Through her he in
duced her father to trust him with the
Investment of his entire capital, some
$35,000. He bolted with the money.
Chased across Europe, a detective
caught him at Bremen. To avoid scan
dal the victim promised not to prose
cute If Benson would give up the
money. The latter did so and left for
America. Hardly was the vessel out
of sight before It was discovered, that
the bundle of scrip \ the thief had
banded over was worth at most $IGO.
Followed across the Atlantic, Ben
son escaped to Mexico, where he made
£5,000 by passing himself off as Mine.
Patti's agent and selling forged con
cert tickets. By this time his photo
graph was in almost ever police bu
reau In the world. Yet he dodged and
twisted under a dozen aliases and was
heard of in almost every South Amer
ican state before a clever New York
detective ran him down in Rio after a
two years' hunt
Even then be cheated justice. Land
ed In prison in Npw York, he walked
upstairs, chatting amiably to his jailer.
Suddenly he made a spring and jumped
clean over the banister. He was picked
up with a broken back and died that
night
The police never exhibit more relent
less energy than in hunting down a
coiner. A coiner's crime is against
government, and so the whole forces
of the state are against him. The
United States suffers far more from
coiners than England does and is
proportionately keen to run down such
offenders. Early in 1000 a man named
Hastings was surprised in his work
shop, from which he had issued many
thousands of small silver coins, but be
was too quick for his would be cap
tors and escaped. No fewer than seven
secret service men were put on bis
track. The remarkable fact Is that
Hastings never attempted to leave the
states.
Ellfer, one of the detectives, got a
bint that a stranger .was In the woods.
He took a. blanket and some food and
bid himself In a thicket Very early
In the morning Hastings passed, carry
ing a bag of food. Ellfer tracked him
to'his refuge and saw that the forger
.was armed. He waited some distance
away In hiding. When night came,
Hastings came out with a dark lan
tern and searched every bush near his
hiding place. At last he was satisfied
and went back. So soon as Ellfer felt
sure the man was asleep be crept up
and had the handcuffs on him before
be could awake. On the way^to the
jail Hastings told his captor that he
bad seen him on ' ten different occa
sions an<! had once, in Cincinnati, been
within thret! feet Of him In a theater.—

JACKSON - CAL
ONE COWSKIN.
In Instance of German Military
Thrift anU Red Tapelsm.
An instance of military thrift and of
a red tape system which is not peculiar
to Germany comes from the Prussian
war office. In 1566 the guards were
breakfasting hurriedly. .They had on
tho previous day fought the battle of
Soor and had accomplished altogether
a' nine days' march. This was not the
era of canned meats, and to each regi
ment had been allotted a certain num
ber of cattle which had been killed,
eklnned and cooked, but while the men
were still eating scouts came in with
the news that the Austrians were near
at hand. .
The men got into marching order and
In a few minutes were in rapid ad
vance toward the enemy. The Grena
dier guards, conspicuous always for
their dispatch, hurried to such purpose
that they failed to secure the skin of
a cow which had been made over to
them for rations. ' ■
When the oiliciai who was responsi
ble for the value of the hide came to
ask for -it, it had to be reported miss
ing. Inquiries were set on foot, evi
dence was collected, and a voluminous
correspondence lasting fourteen or fif
teen months failed to account for the
skin.
There had been a cow. She had been
made over to the guards. She had a
hide. The hide was government prop
erty, representing a sum fixed by offi
cial tariff. The government must be
credited with that sum. The hide was
uot forthcomiug. Who should be re
sponsible for its cash value?
It was at last decided that the colonel
of the regiment should be held account
able, and a year and a half after the
conclusion of the seven weeks' war
he was requested by the war office to
remit the sum of 3 thalers, the price
of one cowskin lost by the Grenadier
guards. When the sum was paid, the
subject was'at last officially dropped.
COSTLY ACCIDENTS.
A Lost Tin Mine and a Lead 9?ine*x
E.ottoniless Pit.
Immense plans which seemed about
to be completed, but have been brought
to disastrous failure at the last mo
ment, are frequent enough in the his
tory of industry.
London Auswers tells the story of a
tin mine in England which might have
yielded a fortune but. for a storm.
With the finding of a. new vein of ore
running out toward the sea a new level
wns drU'en out below the water; then
it was found that the lode bent up
ward too near the sea bottom for min
ing to be safely carried on. Undiseour
aged, the owner borrowed money, built
a sea wall to cut off the water, erected
pumps ami again went to work.
On the sixth day just as an enor
mous mass of rich ore was being tap
ped a gale. came up, a ship was blown
upou the wall, which went to pieces at
on.cc, and the sea drove the heavy
stones in upon the thin roof of the
'mine. In a moment the workings were
hopelessly flooded, and the owner waa
a ruined man.
A story equally tragic is told of the
Speedwell lead mine in Derbyshire.
Believing that a rich vein of ore exist
ed in a nearby hill, the owner risked
his entire capital to bore a tunnel 3,000
feet long into the heart of the moun
tain. Suddenly the miners broke
through a wall of rock into a vast hid
den cavern, through which flowed a
stream of water.
They began to dump rock into the
stream, and after 10,000 tons a bridge
began to rise out of the darkness, and
then their farther progress was stop
ped. Month after month they toiled,
find at last, after 40,000 tons in all
had been cast into the cavern, they
gave it up.
That narrow rift is known to this
day as the Bottomless Pit.
V;mnj of Wrath.
The singular habit of signifying an
ger by yawning Is ccnCned to tie
monkey ; tribe and Is most marked in
the baboon family, though tb;« Gibral
tar apes also Indulge In it. It Is prob
able that the gesture fc originally in
tended to frighten an adversary by. a
display of teeth, Just as a Co.i daes,
and that the constant wide opening of
the mouth produces an Involuntary
yawn. In fact, If a human being
keeps on opening his mouth In this
way a yawn will result. If two
strange baboons are put together in
the same cage, they immediately con
front each other and commence yawn
ing, and If vexed or insulted by vis
itors they will do the same thing.
Fat Crystals.
If email quantities of butter, lard
and beef fat be separately boiled aud
slowly cooled for, say, twenty-four
hours, the resulting crystals will show
very marked differences under the mi
croscope. The normal butter crystal Is
large and globular. It polarizes bril
liantly and shows a well marked St
Andrew's cross. That of lard shows a
stellar form, while that of beef fat has
a foliated appearance. In course of
time, as the butter loses its freshness,
tbe globular crystal degenerates and
gradually merges into peculiar rosette
like forms.
An Old Verb.
To laze is an old "verb. In Samuel
Rowlands' "Martin Markall," 1610, we
are told that "loyterers laze in the
strecte, lurke in alehouses and range
In the highwales." The word occurs,
I believe, in some of Mortimer Collins'
lyrjcsi
But Cupid lazsth 'mongst the faiery lasses,
Whose clere complexion he ott sweareth
passes.

THE GAME OF GAMES.
Golf, Srj-» TUi Writer, Involve* Art,
Science and Inspiration.
It is true that there Is a point of
view from which golf may be regarded
as an extremely simple game— tbe very
simplest of all the games with a ball
and a club, says William G. Brown In
the June Atlantic. The player's object
Is simple and single to the point of
simple, mindedness and singularity, one
might say— to put a small ball In a
small ,. hole with the fewest possible
strokes. But so are the objects of the
highest ambitions, the guiding stars 6f
careers the most perplexed and devi
ous. It is true, likewise, that all the
countless strokes a golfer makes are
resolvable into three kinds of stroke
driving, approaching and putting. But
Mr. E^'erard, in a lecture unsurpassed
for truth and brilliancy by any In all
the extremely clever literature of golf,
has declared that to make those three
strokes aright one must have "art, scl
enei\ aid Inspiration."
- From the moment tbe ball leaves the
tee, whether it be topped, pulled or
sliced or whether, struck in proper
fashion a trifle below the medial line
and urged forward with on exquisite
free lashing out of the wrists. It takes
flight as with wings and seeks its true
course as with a mind and purpose of
Its own until It drops into the cup with
a tintinnabulation that no louder clang
or paean ever surpassed in Its sugges
tion of victory and consummation,
there is no foreseeing what perplexity
or temptation to carelessness or over
confidence it will present.
Not twice off tbe tee ground and the
putting green will the possibilities and
probabilities of the stroke be quite the
same. In the He. the wind, the dis
tance to be traversed, the obstacles to
be carried, there are variations not to
be reckoned by any known mathemat
ics.
. Then, as the match approaches Its
dreadfully quiet climax of defeat or
victory, the responsibility may grow
positively j appalling."" The very delib
eration which, impossible in most
games, is so characteristic of this, so
far from lessening the strain on one's
nerves, undoubtedly heightens it. One
has time to estimate the emergency, to
realize the crisis.
Not the fiercest rally at tennis, not
the longest flnd timeliest home run at
baseball, not the most heroic rush at
football, requires a more rigid concen
tration of thought and energy or a
more dauntless courage than tbe flick
of a putter that sends the ball crawl
ing on its last little journey across the
putting green when the put Is for the
hole and the hole means the match.
There is not a quality of mind or body
—I will not except or qualify at all—
no, not one, that life itself proves ex
cellent which a circuit of the links will
not test.
The Declaration.
It is a rather curious fact that while
facsimiles of the Declaration of Inde
pendence were common enough sev
eral years ago and were largely used
for advertising purposes they are now
very scarce— so scarce that a Phila
delphia collector recently paid §10 for
one bearing the advertisement of a
western railroad. The original docu
ment, preserved In glass, is still to be
seen in the possession of the depart
ment of state in Washington, but It has
become so faded as to be nearly illeg
ible, by reason of which a photograph
ic reproduction would be valueless.

Who has not read of the wi!d exploits

FRIDAY AUGUST 29, 1902
WHERE, OH WHERE?
* A noticeable feature of the demo
cratic convention in Sutter Creek
was a professed scrupulousness in
regard to the. letter of the law. It
was a gathering where lawyers, and
those in charge o f the legal ma
chinery of the cou'.'.y were in con
trol. A fussy spirit, born of a de
sire to steal a march in some way
upon the proceedings of the repub
lican convention held only a week
before, seemed to prevail. It was a
fine scheme to place democracy in
the know-it-all column, and their re
publican opponents in the know
nothing attitude. It was a taking
id.ea, that promised to reflect credit
upon themselves, and discredit upon
the republicans. Casting a legal
and hypercritical eye down the line,
they discovered a mare's nest. The
republican convention had nominat
ed candidates by acclamation — that
is by unanimous vivi voce vote. So
when nominations were in order, the
democratic convention started in to
follow suit. When up jumps an ob
jector. That plan would not do.
The law in such cases made and pro
vided, required the secretary to cast
the vote of. the convention. Not a
soul had the temerity to dispute this
proposition of law. And so it came
to pass that the absurd scene was
enacted in every nomination made —
from superior judge down to con
stable for the respective townships
— of the secretary putting in and
taking out a scrap of paper from
a hat, and thereafter by some
legerdemain process branding it as
the vote of 67 individuals compris
ing the gathering. It was a soul
inspiring spectacle. Every sensible
man in the hall must have been pro
foundly impressed with the genius
of the legislator who could thus do
the miracle act of transforming one
innocent ballot into any number of
ballots required, and label it u due
process of law." The delegates
waxed gleeful over the dilemma, and
told the "terrified" how their repub
lican friends had bceu caught in the
meshes of a "web." One speaker,
more bold than the rest, actually
patted the democracy on the back,
metaphorically speaking, for its
stern adherence to the technicalities
of law. He evidently was not enthu
siastic over the "one means 67" per
formance, but nevertheless it was
declared to be the law, and that set
tled it. The writer was fairly nou
plussed, not so much for the safety
of the republican ticket that had
run into such a fatal snare, but for
the fair name of the California legis
lature. Was it possible that the
law making power had resolved it
self into a lunatic asylum, and placed
such an idiotic provision upon the
statute book? What would become
of the vaunted freedom of the Amer
ican citizens, if such tomfool ideas
were to be elevated into law. We
hunted up the California election
laws, and lo what a load was lifted
from our saddened spirit on discov
ering—as we fully expected to dis
cover — that no such silly provision
was contained in the book. It was
a bugaboo of their own creation — a
sample of democratic convention
made law. Conventions may, and
often do adopt the rule, but to say
that such mummery is mandatory
under the state -law will not pass
muster. We therefore, join with
our readers, in indulging the hope
that the country is still safe, the
proclamations of the democracy to
the contrary notwithstanding.
DEGENERATE MANAGEMENT.
The degenerate trend of the local
democracy under its present man-
agement was signally illustrated by
the action of their convention in re
gard to the justice of the peace in
township one. It is well known
that the administration of justice in
this township falls a long way short
of what it ought to be. We are
willing to concede that tbe justice
, has "done the best he knew how."
__Still there is no denying the fact,
• that the safeguarding of the rights
of citizens and of the community has
been more in the nature of a broad
farce than anything else. To no one
are the shortcomings of the present
regime more apparent than to those
in Jackson who shape the destinies
of the local democracy. Indeed,
they have frequently expressed
themselves in regard to the intoler
able state of inefficiency, and a deter
mination to do their utmost to end
; it. Sympathy has played a conspic
uous part in continuing the court as
it is, and this same potent factor in
politics is relied upon to cut a figure
in perpetuating the conditions under
which we have suffered for so many
years. We have no objection to
sympathy entering into politics. If
public interests can be subserved
' ■ <'■, ■"
equally as . well by following the
promptings of sympathy, no valid
objection can be raised against trav
eling the sympathetic path. For
many years no one has contested
for the democratic nomination
agains the present incumbent, prob
ably from sympathetic motives.
This year, however, three other can
didates announced their intention to
go before the convention, each one
possessed of more thau average in
telligence. It became the most
sought-after oflice in the county,
not because there was mouey in it,
but in response to the demand for a
change. The aspirants were encour
aged by party leaders, and promise
of relief spanned the democratic
convention, Now what is the result.
One by one, these intelligent citizens
are told that they have no show of
success — told by the very men who
encouraged their candidacy in the
first place. One after another they
dropped out of the race, until finally
the incumbent. is left the lone seeker
for the nomiuation as of yore. Thus
are public interests subordinated to
party necessities. Democratic can
didates for re-election perhaps
thought they would lose a few votes
if things were changed. So the op
portunity which they failed to take
advantage of has been relegated to
the people in general at the ballot
box. We believe the people will
know how to deal with the issue,
and also with the party that has not
the courage to face a local proposi
tion when 'it is squarely passed up
to them.
U S Gregory, in acknowled^'iDg
the houor of his nomiuation as
sheriff, emphatically and in all seri
ousness declared to the democratic
convention, in reference to his re
publican opponent, that "tbe Lord
God Almighty knows he will need
the assistance of his friends." That
was certainly a wise remark to be
dropped by an astute politician. For
whose enlightenment was it intend
ed? Every one that knows Tom
Norman is fully aware that he is . a
long way from that state of self
sufficiency as to imagine that he can
get along without the assistance of
his friends. His friends also are
alive to the fact that he will need
their help, and they will tender it
williugly and liberal!}'. By the way,
are the voters of Amador county to
infer from the characteristic remark
of the democratic candidate that
Mr. Gregory does not need the as
sistance of his friends. Is his own
right hand strong enough to win
the victory. It is just that sort of
spirit that the citizens of Amador
county are getting heartily sick of.
When a servant, of the people as
sumes the air of the. autocrat, and
imagines he is the whole show in
himself, they have unquestioned
grounds for thinking that a change
is desirable, and will act according
ly. "Pride goeth before a fall."
The democratic convention, which
was to have been, according to those
not on the inside, a free-for-all, go
as-you-please scrimmage, turned out
to be a mutual admiration society.
Every candidate was patted and
palavered by the convention, and
the candidates cMd the slobbering
act likewise. On the surface, every
anticipated point of friction was
smoothed down. Tom Gartlin, who
was on the opposition program for
the .sheriff nomination, -was put
hors-de-combat by being elected
chairman. A. B. McLaughlin, who
was also spoken of for the shrievalty,
or at least the supervisor nomina
tion in his district, was sent to the
state convention. Sargent, who
was after the justice of the peace for
township one, got the . chairmanship
of tbe county central committee in
stead. In fact, everything was done
to plaster up the sores, and if any
remains still open, it is for the rea
sou that they did not have enough
sticking plaster to go round.
PARDEE FOR GOVERNOR.
After five ineffectual ballots, in all
of which governor Gage maintained
a strong lead, George C. Pardee of
Oakland, the well-known oculist, was
nominated for governor on the re
publican ticket on v the sixth ballot.
The honor fell to the Alameda man
through the strengh of the Gage
forces being thrown solidly in his
favor, the final vote standing Pardee
518 to 213 for Flint. The Amador
delegation on the last ballot stood,
as we are inlormed, Davis, Marchant,
Herrick and Whitinore for Pardee;
Voorheis, Tregloan and Barney for
Flint. The outcome of the long
drawn-out struggle will be hailed
withsatisfaction by republicans gen
erally. Pardee will unite all factions
and carry the practically solid vote
of his party.
The full republican state ticket is
as follows: Governor, Geo. C. Par
dee, Alameda; Lieu tenant-Governor,
Alden Anderson, Solano; Chief Jus
tice, W. H. Beatty, Sacramento;

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION
The Same Old Stereotyped
Ticket Fixed Up
All Opposition Smothered — Proxies
Plentiful — Slate Goes Through
.Vv .-. : Without a Scratch.
The democratic convention for the
nomination of a full got of county of
ficers, met in Sutter Creek on Satur
day, August. 23. A lively time was
looked for. as the upshot of the vigor
ous kicking and pulling that has been
going on in the ranks of the "terrified"
for many months past, and as a result
a number of outsiders were attracted
to the scene in the belief that there was
likely to be some fun. But they were
disappointed. One of tbe tamest and
least-rußled gatherings, from surface
indications, that has ever assembled in
Amador county was tho outcome. As
one delegate said, "I don't know what
we came for; we had nothing to do, we
were not called upon to settle a single
proposition that was not already set
tled beforehand. Half a dozen men
might have met and transacted the
business just the same." It docs not
follow, however, that this cut-and
dried proposition was entirely satis
factory. It was the result of a- good
deal of political manipulation and wire
pulling. The seeds of discontent are a
long way from being eradicated.
The convention assembled in Le
vaggi's hall at eleven o'clock, and was
called to order by T. M. Ryan, chair
man of the county central committee.
On motion Thos. Gartlin of lone, was
made temporary chairman, and J. A.
Barber of the agricultural experiment
station, temporary secretary.
The ; usual committees wore then
named.
The convention thereupon adjourned
until half-past one o'clock.
Upon reassembling, Dr. E. E. Endi
cott, as chairman' of the committee on
credentials, reported the following en
titled to seats in the convention:

for all). \ ■
South Plymouth— Lee Clark, George

Forest Home— J. Reigan, J. Beaver,
(Roberts proxy for both).
The committee on permanent organ
ization and order of business reported
that the temporary officers be made
permanent, also that C. E. Jarvis be
mailo vice president; the election of 7
delegates to the state convention, one
from each township and two from coun
ty at large, and thereafter the nomi
nation of county officers in the usual
order.
The report was adopted as read.
The committee on platform and reso
lutions made a brief report, reaffirming
allegiance to the doctrines of democracy
as taught, by Thomas' Jefferson and
Andrew Jackson. Commended, the
democratic county officers for the faith
ful and economic discharge of their
duties. Pledged earnest support to
the candidates nominated by the state
and district conventions. Indorsed the
Amador Dispatch as the exponent of
the democratic faith in Amador county.
Denounced as unjust tho apportion
ment of the assembly district, by which
Amador county has been deprived of a
representative in the legislature. In
dorsed E. C. Farnsworth for a place on
the stato ticket as justice of supremo
court.
W. Ford wanted to know why the
name of W. J. Bryan should not be in
cluded in the platform. -Mr. Bole as
chairman of the committee, had no
objection to the suggestion, and so the
muchly repudiated man from Nebraska
was placed side by side with Jefferson
and Jackson, and tho report as amend
ed was adopted. With this mix-up
there was probably not a delegate in
the hall that had any i3ea where he
was at. It wa3 a striking illustration
of the statement that the democratic
party is able to straddle or swallow any
old thing that comes along without so
much as blinking an eye. The only
live issue with them is, "We want tho
ollicos: we want them badly; we will
always want them."
DELEGATES TO STATE CONVENTION.
The selection of two delegates at
large to the state convention, developed
the only tussle of the day. J. L. Sar
gent nominated T. M.Ryan of Jackson;
T. H. Gartlin nominated J. W. Sur
face of lone, and Dr. Endicott nomi
nated A. Caminetti. A ballot was
taken with the following result: Total
number of votes, 67; necessary for
choice, 34. Catninetti received 63, Sur
face ;><>, Ryan 16. Caminetti and Sur
face wore thereupon declared elected
di.lcijates at large. From the respective
townships delegates to stale convention
were elected as follows: Township 1,
Dr. E. E. Endicott; township 2, John
Muldoon; township 3, A. B. Me- }
Laughlin; township 4, C. E. Jarvis;
Township 5. A. J. Cram.
NOMINATION OF COUNTY OFFICERS.
R. C. Bole placed R. C. Ru6t, present
incumbent, in nomination for superior
judge. In doing so he tendered the
information that before being elected
to the bench, ho had been in partner
ship with some of the most eminent
lawyers in the state, and in only one
instance had he been reversed by tbe
supreme court. There was no second,
and it was proposed to make him the
nominee by acclamation, whereupon J.
L. Sargent stated that the law in such
cases made and provided rendered it
necessary for the secretary to cast the
vote of the convention for the nominee.
This declaration of the farcical and
mock nature of California law pass
ed without challenge. According
ly the secretary wrote the name of the
candidate on a slip of paper, threw the
same in a hat held out to receivo it by
W. L. Rose, the sergeant-at-arms, and
immediately rescued the precious slip
from its repository, and announced
that the vote of the convention, with
out stating the number of votes, was
for R. C. Rust for superior judge. This
comedy in the name of law was repeat
ed in every nomination made for not
only county officers, but also for town
ship officers.
A. Caminetti, with au eye to busi
ness, intimated that an important point
had been overlooked, and moved that
every candidate placed before the con
vention be required to deposit five dol
lars with the secretary. • Carried.
Judge Rust then appeared, and put
up the coin, thanked the convention
for the expression of confidence of the
democratic party in his administration
of nearly 8 years. All his hopes and
interests had been bound up in Amador
county since 1883. He had discharged
his duties the best he knew how, and
if again honored, would continue to do
so.
Sheriff and Tax Collector— J. W.
Surface nominated U S Gregory, and
said that he was not a one-sided sheriff;
he was the people's sheriff; he had no
superior, and few equals; he had fol
lowed offenders into Arizona; he had
paid every cent collected into the coun
ty treasury— what more do* you "want.
Dr. Endicott seconded the nomina
tion, and said that U S was a democrat
from the soles of his big feet to the
crown of his big head. Some of those
who seemed to think that tbe demo
cratic party of Amador is dead and
buried, will find themselves irretriev
ably tangled In the meshes of the web.
This little funnyism seemed to tickle
the democratic palate amazingly.
U S Gregory stepped to the stage,
and said it was the fourth time that ho
had been nominated for this position
unanimously. He could not repay
them for the honor except by honest
and faithful service. He expressed the
opinion that the "Lord God Almighty
knows that his opponent will need the
support of his party and friends" in the
fight for the office.
District Attorney — C. E. Jarvis nom
inated and R. C. Bole seconded C. P.
Vicini for this office, the latter pro
phesying that he would have a bigger
majority than he had last time. The
nominee in response also had to express
his belief that he was going to be re
elected in November.
County Clerk and Auditor— For this
place C. E. Fournier placed in nomina
tion the present incumbent, C. L. Cul
bort, seconded by J. L. Sargent. The
candidate in acknowledgement admit
ted that ho had a harder light than he
ever had before, and called upon those
in the hall to assist him.
Treasurer— A. Caminetti placed Geo.
A. Gritton-before the convention for
this office.
County Recorder — A. Caminetti nom
inated D. A. Patterson, the present
recorder, who, amid much cheering,
thanked his party for the honor, and
hoped that the entire ticket named
would be elected, and if his vote would
do it, they should have it.
Assessor — J. L. Sargent nominated
John W. Mathis of Willow Springs.
C. E. Jarvis seconded, who also fell
into the prophetic line, saying that ho
would bo elected. The nominee said
ho had heen 25 years in the party, and
during all that time had taken part in
its deliberations and meetings, but had
never before allowed his name to be
mentioned in connection with any
official position.
School Superintendent— Geo. A. Gor
don, present incumbent, was named for
renomination by T. H. Gartlin and
seconded by J. L. Sargent. Mr. Gor
don in response said that some might
find fault with him because he had
been such a stickler for law. But how
careful the convention had been in the
same direction. Instead of the accla
mation business, one man had been
asked to cast the vote of the entire con
vention for every candidate nominated.
Why? For no other reason than that
the law required that a ballot should
be taken by the convention. - ■
Coroner and Public Administrator-
George M. Huborty of Jackson, was
named for this pace by R. C. Bole and
seconded by S. N. D. Spagnoli.
County Surveyor— W. L. Fortner
placed William Brown of Oleta, before
the gathering, and the 85 deposit was
remitted in this case, and also for town
ship nominees except supervisors.
TOWNSHIP NOMINATIONS.
Nominations for township officers
were reported to the gathering, which
by this time had been shorn of half its
numerical strength, as follows:
Township I— Justice, H. Goldner;
constable, A. Laverone.
Township 2— Justice, no nomination;
constable, J. E. Kelly. >
Township 3 — Supervisor, Joseph
Pigeon, of Oleta; Justice, A. W. Rob
inson; constable, J. W. Lessley.
Township 4— Justice, W. L. Rose;
constable to be filled.
Township s— Supervisor, Lawrence
Burke; Justice, W. H. Kroning; con
stable, vacant.
COUNTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE.
The county tentral committee was
t'm-n named as follows: J. L. Sargent,
cointnitteeman at large and chairman;
Township 1, \V. 11. Carloy, A. Caini
notii; township 2, T. H. Gartlin. Thos.
Scully; townships, JamosLo wry, John

to iill all vacancies in the ticket.
The auditing committee was appoint
ed as follows: John Sanguinotti. R. H.
Bagley, Ed Baker, A. Riley and A. J.
Coster. .;'■'.;
The convention then adjourned with
out the usual cheers, for the reason we
presume that by this timo there wa&
not enough left to maku a respectable
showing 1 on the cheering line. Tho
boys, however, did not hie away home
upon adjournment, but kept up the
sociable and convivial spirit until tho
dawn of the Sabbath.* . "

To My Friends.
It is with joy I tell you what Kodol
did for me. I was troubled with my
stomach for several months. Upon
being advised to uso Kodol, I did so,
and words cannot toll the good it has
done me. A neighbor had dyspepsia
so that he had tried most everything.
1 told him to uso Kodol. Words of
gratitude have como to mo from him
because I recommended it.— Goo. W.
Fry, Viola, Iowa. Health and strength,
of mind and body, depend on the
stomach, and normal activity of the
digestive organs. Kodol, the great
reconstructive tonic, cures all stomach
and bowel troubles, indigestion, dys
pepsia. Kodol digests auy good food
you eat. Take a dose after meals.

Tom Ryan is the most snubbed man
in the democratic ranks. He has been
doing duty for democracy for the past]
two years as chairman of the county
central committee. It is needless to
Bay that the position is one that in
volves lots of drudgery, and no thanks
nor pay therefor. Tom thought his
services at least worth the small honor
of being sent as a delegate to the state
convention, and allowed his name to be
presented for delegate-at-large. That
was fair. But his aspirations were not
pleasing to those who do politics fro
a business standpoint. Out of ti7 vote
Ryan received 10. What an examp
of party gratitude.
The boat built by theGarbarini Bro
for Laverone and Flagg, to be used o
Silver lake next season, was taken t
the Argonaut reservoir last Saturda
to be tasted as to its properties. Th
boat is 12 feet long and 3 feet 6 inch
wide. It is constructed of iron, wit
air tight compartments so that it is im
possible to sink it, and vory diilieult to
cap6izeit. Tbe trial on the reservoir
was perfectly siiiisfaetory. It held
nine men; with thive men its draft was
only nine inches. It is so constructed
that when one end goes under water,
the other end is clear out of water. It

A narrow escape from a serious lire
occurred last Monday in one of Judge

from the roof around the stove pipe,

An alarm was turned in, by means of a

THE AMADOR LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA,. FRIDAY, .AUGUST 29, 1902.
Dwelling House Earned.
One of the double dwelling houses
owned by A. C. Brown on Summit
street, was completely destroyed by
fire Wednesday morning. It was a
largo frame building, with basement
and ground floor, and was occupied,
until the day before the (iro by three
families. Mrs. Crook lived in the south
part of the ground floor; the north
part had been occupied by .t he barber
Gasparoni and wife, who vacated the
premises on Monday, and left them
selves for San Francisco the morning
of tho fire. The lower part was oc
cupied by a family named Giovanoni.
A galvanized iron flue, that ran from
the basement to the roof, and was
used by the two families, was the cause
of tho fire. It was placed close up to
the woodwork, and anything like a
fierce fire in the stovu was liable to
ignite tho lumber. Three or four times
a fire had been started in this way, tho.
last time being only last Monday.
Wednesday morning about 11 o'clock
the roof around the stove pipe was
found to be in flames. The fire-bell
was started by hand, and people with
fire apparatus from both fire houses
were promptly on hand. Little, how
ever, could bo done toward saving the
building. The furniture was. nearly all
got out from both apartments. Tho
water power available was so feeble
that no stream could be thrown on the
top of the house where it was ablaze.
■This, by some, was supposed to be
caused by a lack of a full head; others
attributed to the fact that all 'over
town hoses wore trotted out and
brought into use, and also tho long lines
of fire company's hose were leaking bad
ly at almost every joint, materially re
ducing the supply at the nozzle. The
firemen worked uobly under these dis
advantages, and managed to confine
the flames to the one building, - which,
however, was entirely destroyed. The
loss is estimated at fully 31000, with no
insurance. Fortunately, the wind was
from the west, which blew the flames
toward a vacant lot on the opposite
side of the street. Had the wind been
in any other direction, there would
have been little hope, with the scant
water supply, of preventing a far more
serious conflagration. The shade trees
on either side of the burniug building
were of material help in preventing the
spread of the flames.
Mrs Crook lost all her kitchen furni
ture, and considerable other furniture.
She was fully insured in the sum of

A Scarcity of Water.
There was much unfavorable com
ment at the time of the fire Wednes
day, on account of tho shortness of
water. As usual the owner of the
water works fell heir to the major
share of tho blame. Questions wore
tired at the manager, why the tanks
wore not kept full, and why tho water
was not shut off from the other portion
of town, as of courso when every
hydrant is open the pressure available
for fire purposes is thereby reduced.
Mr. Blair, the manager, says that it is
no part of his duty to look after the
tanks. Those tanks are the property
of the ditch company, and tho owner
of tho town water works has no more
right to interfere with them than any
other citizen. Neither is it the prov
ince of the water works to shut the
water off from any point in town during
'a tire. It seems that all such matters
ought to be arranged by the fire com
pany. What is a fire company for
unless to take charge of all- such work
in the emergency of a fire. A man
ought to be employed whose business,
at the first tap of the bell, should be to
make for the tanks at the head of the
pipe, and see that every thing was right.
Another ought to be selected to shut
off the water from certain points not
menaced, so as to secure all the water
possible at the danger point. Above
and beyond all, protection agaiust fire
demands that the apparatus for fight
ing fire be keptin order; that couplings
are in working trim and can be readily
jointed ; that tho joints are reasonably
water tight, and nozzles likewise. Fire
houses and fire alarms are of little
avail unless the means are available to
contend against a fire when one occurs.
We have men who respond at every
fire, and do their utmost iv subduing
the flames. They are always at the
iront on such occasions, and the citi
zens owe them a debt of gratitude they
can neyer repay. Rut they cannot be
expected to look after things all the
time. If a small sum monthly were
paid to some one to look after such
matters as tho water supply, and tho
hose, and couplings— the small things
on which big results depend— it would
bo money well expended.
To the Public,
IONE, Aug. 22, l!J02.
The article in the Araador Lod
ger regarding my registration does J.
Surface and C. L. Culbert an injustice.
Neither of them refused to register
me. Mr. Surface sent for mo to be
registered in the first place. But when
I went to register there was a doubt
in my owu mind from where I should
bo registered, and Mr. Surface sug
gested that I get legal advice on the
matter. I did so, and thereafter Mr,
Surface registered me. C. Hansen.
[At the request of county clerk Cul
bert we give place to the abovo state
ment. We have to say, however, that
the facts as narrated in the article re
ferred to, wero all obtained from Mr.
Hansen himself. There was not the
slightest intention on our part to nils
tato or twist tho facts from their plain
and obvious meaning. Furthermore,
tho explanation above does not contro
vert a single statement in the Ledger's
article. The article nowhere says that
Mr. Hansen was "refused" registration
in South lone by either the county
clerk or his deputy in lone. To refuse
registration to a qualified voter already
on tho great register is a different mat
ter. The statement that the article
"docs J. Surface and C. L. Culbert an
injustico" is simply a matter of opinion,
which wo avo content to leave to the
impartial judgment of our readers. —

SHOT DEAD BY A WOMAN
A Midnight Tragedy on
•Broadway.
An Intrndcr at Perovich's Boarding
House Instantly Killed by
Mrs. - Perovich.
At the dead hour of midnight a fatal
shooting took pla<?e at : Perovich's
boarding house on Broadway, Jiickson,
the victim being an Austrian named
Petor Mihaijlovich, who was employed
at the Gwin mine. He formerly worked
a-s cook at Perovich'*, but left about
15 months ago, and siaco that time has
worked as a miner at the Gwin. An
drew Perovich, tho boarding house
keeper, has been sick for some time,
and trying to recuperate at the springs.
He left for Byron Springs again only
last Saturday, and was there at the
timo of tho shooting, his wife being left
in charge of the boarding house, where
a largo number of boarders are ktpt,
tho sleeping . rooms being mainly in
rear of tbo residence portion of the
premises. About midnight Thursday,
after every one had retired, Mrs. Pero
vieh was disturbod by some one about
the premises. Tho footsteps indicated
that the man was prowling around from
no good motives. Mrs. Perovich was
occupying v room on tho north side of
the building and immediately adjoin
inir the room fronting Broad way. The
3
bedroom window stands six feet from
the sidewalk, but immediately below
there is a ventilator opening into the
basement about 18 inches from the
ground, and from this one could easily
climb to the window". Mrs. Perovieh
was nervous and alarmed at the strange
footfalls, fearing that tbe man was
beut on mischief. All the outer doors
were kept locked. But Mlhaijlovioh
gained an entrance by means of a win
dow in the rear of the kitchen. This
was simply protected by a screen, which
was easily removed." The intruder
thereby gained access to a room ad
joining the kitchen. He the.n passed
through the kitchon, dining room, sit
ting room, to a small hallway, the
partition of which separates the hall
way from Mrs. Perovieh's room. Upon
this . wall he commenced rapping.
There appeared to be no one else awake
at tho time, although Miss Perovieh,
in another room, says she heard noises.
Finally tho intruder passed out
through a side entrance, and took a
position untler the window of' Mrs.
Perovich's sleeping room, and raising
himself up from tho ventilator stop he
began knocking on the window. Mrs.
Perovieh, although thoroughly fright
ened, but determined to protect taor
self, asked, ''What do you want." He
said, I> l waut to como in your room; 1
want to talk to you for an hour or
two." She recognized the voice, and
told him to go away; that if he did not
she would shoot him. The man
actually drew his revolver from his hip
pocket, and presented it to her saying,
"Hero's v revolver, take it and shoot
if you waut to." Mrs. Perovieh pushed
him from tho window, saying, "No, 1
have a revolver. " The man was per
sistent, and again attempted to climb
up by tho window, when Mrs. Poro
vlch, in self-protection, fired. Tlie
pistol was but a fo.v inches from the
man's head, and tho first shot struck
him squarely in the right eye, pene
trating the brain and killing him in
stantly. Ho fell backward dead. In
the nervousuess of tho moment Mrs.
Perovieh says sho may have discharged
two or throe chambers afterwards, but
they were fired simply at random. The
edge of the window sill shows powder
marks, also marks evidently made by
the hand of the victim in trying to pull
himself up to tho window. The venti
lator step also plainly shows tho marks
of his foot. The shooting roused the
inmates and neighbors. Nightwatch
man Parker appeared on tho scene.
The man who thus forfeited his life as
tho result' of his own folly, lay stretched
out with his head not six feet from the
house, a stream of blood issuing from
the wound, and running fully five or
six feet, down the path toward tho
front gato. Tho Austrian boarders
would not touch the body. Mrs, Pero
vich, who appeared sef I -possessed
throughout, would not allow the corpse
to be taken into the house. So Parker,
Constable Kay, Dr. Gall and H.
Schacht, carried the body from the
fatal spot to the undertaking parlors of
Huberty and Giovannonl.
A representative of the Ledger offieo
saw Mrs' Porovich this morning, and
obtained from her most of the facts of
tho tragedy as detailed above. She
apparently was not excited, but stated
that the mau bad been a source of con
siderable annoyance. It is probable
that he learned of the absence of Mr.
Perovich. He left the Gwin mine on
horsoback, and. tho horse was "found
tied up beyond the. Zeila mine, and
Constable Kay had it taken home this
morning. Andrew Porovich, husband
of tho heroine, was notified by tele
phono, and is expected home to-night.
The sentiment of the community is
entirely with the brave woman who
shot in self defense. No legal step has
been taken, and probably none will be
taken, other than the impanelment of
a coroner's jury, which will likely be
held to-day, and this will doubtless de
cide the whole matter.
Tho victim has no relatives here. He
is a native of Montenegro, and about
34 years of ago.

Fine Befrigerating Plant.
On Saturday last the representative
of the Ledger had the pleasure of in
specting the new refrigerating or cold,
storage plant just installed by Geo.
Waechter, tho enterprising butcher of
Sutter Creek. It is the tirst plant of
the kind installed in Amador county,
and is as far in advance of the old
methods of preserving meats as a mow
ing machine is over a scythe. The
storage room itself Is about 10x8 in
size, of sufficient capacity to store from
eight to ten beeves. The room is lined
with compressed cork^ about two
inches thick. This is found to be tho
best insulating material for keeping out
heat that is known. Just outside the
coW room is the refrigerating machine
from tho Cyclops Iron Works of San
Francisco. By means of pipes the cold
air is conveyed into the room, the tem
perature of which is kept between 34
and JO degrees. The machinery is
kept running about 12 hours a day;
and during the stoppage of the other
twelve hours, tho temperature in the
room will not increase more than four
degreos, owing to the resistance of tLe
cork insulation.
The machinery is operated by a six
horse power Economist crude oil gas
engine, of which E. H. Schmltz of Sut
ter Creek is the agent. It works like
a charm, requiring but two-horse
power to run the works, at an esti
mated cost of from 30 to 40 cents per
day of eight hours. The c»st of the
entire plant is placed at something like
$2500. It does the work equal to ono
ton of ice every 24 hours. The cost of
ice would bo at least $10 per day. With
this plant the expense, including inter
est op. investment, will not much ex
ceed $1 per day. The advantage Is not
merely one of expense, but also of
better results in other ways. The air.
though almost at tho freezing point, Is
dry. There is no dampness or moisture,
which Is the great drawback with ice.
It is well known, that meat packed in
ico, will lose its flavor, and will rapidly
taint on being taken from its icy
quarters. With the improved method,
the meat retains its flavor, and is all
tho better in every way for being kept
three or four days. Mr. Waechter has
made a great stride in the meat-pre
serving business, and other butchers in
the county will do well to look into the
matter with tho view of following in
his footsteps.

MINING NEWS.*
The Mitchell mine has struck a rich

additional 10 stamps will be started
up soon.
The Horn Mining Company is vigor
ously developing their property, and
expect in less than a month to be ship
ping ore for treatment. Samples of
rock left at the Ledger office will go
betwoen $200 and $300 per ton.
John McKelvey, an Oakland capital
ist, has a man at work on the Belmont
mine prospecting for tho pay, chute.
The old works have been closed down
for nearly two years, but it is believed
a pay chute exists further down the
hill.
John Williams and .D. Fisher jr.
have contracted to sink tho shaft of
the Edinburgh G. Mg. Co. The com

IN THREE COUNTIES.
A Mountain Eesort That Furnishes a
Perplexing Problem.
One of the mountain valleys, known
as Kirkwood's meadows, is located on
the intersection of Amador, Alpine and
El Dorado counties. Tho meadows
take their name from a peculiar genius
who is a combination of cattle raiser,
sheep herder, store keeper, * hotel
keeper and navigator of a wayside
blacksmith shop up there in the sum
mer season, and private citizen down
on the plains the remainder of the
year. 1 recall that the bar of his re
sort, which is located exactly on top
of the corner post marking the boun
daries of the three counties named, has
furnished the license collectors one of
the most intricate mathematical prob
lems ever raised in the state as to which
publican was entitled to gather the
same. For it so happened that Kirk
wood could stand in El Dorado county
and respond to a call for one or the
other of his famous brands of potent
beverage known respectively as "sheep
dip" and "sheep herder's delight" —
more properly, ''sudden death" and
"live-a-week" — and set up the bottle
of condensed and concentrated tragedy
in Amador county. Then the perpen
dicular bounded warehouse over in Al
pine county, would lift the bottle from
Amador county and pour out his dose
of fatality in Alpine county, and change'
his breath to a volcanic condition, and
lay down tho price for his es
cape in El Dorado county* which Zack
would pick up and drop in the till over
in Amador county. By the time the
vaquero over in Alpine had crooked
his elbow twice, ho would find himself
imbued with an unsteady and more or
less dazed impression that he was pos
sessor in feu simple of all three coun
ties, and that his limits wero still en
tirely too restricted.
If tho Amador license collector called,
he found Zack busy transferring liquids
from El Dorado into Alpine, while the
Amador end of the bar was "out of
business." If the El Dorado man call
ed, Amador and Alpine got busy. If
the Alpine bird of prey settled down,
Amador and El Dorado monopolized
mercantile transactions and, after tho
Alpine vaquero paid for his commodi
ties, the laws of free and unrestricted
trade between counties prevailed; the
purchaser was permitted to select his
own spot to suicide, and all that Zack
paid the license collectors was his dis
tinguished respects. — Exchange.

table origin. This local stuff is midway
between coal and wood. Many pieces
may bo picked up from the dump hav
ing more of the characteristics of wood
than coal. It can be slivered with a
knife, liko a piece of pine wood. It
carries a large percentage of sulphur.
Some days ago, the heap, which was
about six to eight feet high, was
noticed to be smoking. They set to
work to ascertain the cause, and at the
depth of two or three feet from the
surface the coal was found so hot as to
becomo unbearable to the naked hand.
A good soaking 'averted the danger.
It was fortunate, however, that the
matter was noticed in time, as a few
hours more might have started a blaze.

From Silver Lake.
E. S. Petois made a flying trip to
Blue Lakes last week, starting Wed
nesday and returning Sunday. H«
went after his son Julius, but found
that he was working for the Standard
Company at the Meadows dam.
Nine camping outfits were met on bis
return trip, among them being Frank
L. Pitt and wife, who are making a
two months' tour of the mountains.
Frank is looking after a sheep range In
tho mountains with the intention of
again taking up his residence in the
foothills of the Sierras, as he finds the
climate of Boulder Creek, in Santa
Cruz county, too damp for him in the
winter season.
There were three camps at Kirk
wood's, two at Capels lake, and none
at Silver lake.
The Standard Electric Company has
commenced hauling all the material,
machinery, etc., from the Bear river
camp to Blue lakes and neighboring
camps. Two loads had already ' pa>iei
over the road at the time our informant

The road is getting rough and badly
cut up as the result of this heavy traffic.

Judge Darts' Wit.
The late Noah Davis, justice of the
supreme court of New York, was one
of many Judges and lawyers who
make the courtroom the scene of some
of our best wit and humor. The New
York Commercial Advertiser gives
some illustrations.
Once a lawyer objected to a witness,
but Judge Davis refused to sustain
him. The lawyer cried, "But, your
honor, I eubmit"— And here lie broke
off.
"That's right," said the judge quick
ly; "always submit Crier, adjourn
court!" .
In one case over which he presided
there were fifty-five distinct offenses
and four counts on each offense, 220 in
all.
"Well," said Judge Davis, "there are
more counts than in a German princi
pality."
Fans In Shakeapeare'a Time.
Fans in Shakespeare's time seem to
have been composed of ostrich and oth
er feathers fastened to handles. Gen
tlemen carried fans in those days, and
in one of the later figures of the ger
man they now carry fans. According
to an old manuscript in the Asbmolcun
museum, Sir Edward Oole rode the cir
cuit with a prodigous fan, which h#d a
long stick, with which he corrected his
daughters. .

THE SOUND OF A PIANO,
Seeming; Defects That May De Often
Dae to Cxterlar Causes.
"A piano," said a dealer, "will snine-
develop or seem to develop a
flaw in someone note, which comes to
have a rattle or jingle or unpleasant
burr to it, bnt this jarring sound which
seoms to come from the piano may in
reality come from some source quite
outside of it.
'"Any given note when struck pro
duces a certiiin number of vibrations to
the secoud. There may be in the room
some object that Is in tone sympathy
with some particular note, and that
will be set in motion by it when that
note is sounded.
"The owner of a fine piano sent to us
one day to say that there was some
thing wrong about a certain note of
the instrument, bo that that note had
sn unpleasant sound when struck.
When 1 heard the note sounded, I knew
at once that the disagreeable rough
ness or buzz about it was due not to
any defect In the piano, but to some
thing somewhere about in the room,
aud, asking the lady to strike that note
occasionally, I walked around the room
to see if I could locate it.
"Passing across the middle of the
room as that note was struck, the
cause of the jarring accompaniment of
it was, discovered to come from the vi
bration of one of the glass globes on
the chandelier overhead.
"The owner of the piano was almost
incredulous as to this, the sou ad had
seemed so plainly to come from the
piano itself. But when at my request
she stood under the chandelier and I
struck the note she was readily con
vinced.
"I made that globe immovable and
then struck the note on the piano. The
answer was clear and sweet and true.
"So, you see, the sound of the piano
may for one' thing depend much upon
its surroundings, and what may seem
to be a defect in a piano may be in re
ality attributable to something quite
apart from the piano itself. '
"And thus It might easily be that
some noble instrument that had seem
ed to be declining or to be developing
faults owed its apparent change to a
change of environment or to some spe
cific outside cause and was in reality
as good as ever, as would happily be
discovered whenever the instrument
was again brought under favorable
conditions."— Chicago Inter Ocean.
POPULAR SCIENCE.
The microbe of the tuberculosis may
lire on a book 103 days, as has been
shown by experiment
Of 1,000 parts of the moon 570 are
visible to us on the earth; 424 parts re
main hidden absolutely to man's eyes.
Without its atmosphere, which serves
as a coverlet to protect it against the
fearful cold of space, the surface of the
earth would be frozen like that of the
airless moon.
A certain duration of a luminous im
pression is necessary to produce an ef
fect on the retina. Hence it is that we
do not see a very rapidly "moving ob
ject, such as a bullet fired from a gun.
If this globe were cooled down to 200
degrees below zero of centigrade, it
would be covered with a sea of lique
fied gas thirty-five feet deep, of which
about seven feet would be liquid oxy

DAIRY NOTES.
Clover Is better than timothy for
cows.
Regularity in feeding nnd milking la
important
To get all of the butter the cream
must be uniformly ripened.
In milking squeeze tue teats just
hard enough to get the milk.
Ct>wß that are good producers of
rich milk must be good consumers.
In order to secure rich milk etnrt
with a rich cow and feed her rich
foods.
In small quantities cottonseed meul
is a good feed, but in excess it in
jures tho butter.
Kicking a cow: that is lying down
ma"y make her' get up more quickly,
but it will not induce her to give any
more milk.
If rock salt is kept in tho yard where
the cows can lick it every day, there
is no danger that they will get too
much at once.
One of the most important condi
tions of churning is the temperature of
the cream. No guess should be allowed,
but a good $hermoinetcr used.
WHAT IS TEMPERAMENT!
Ko Wonder This X Child's Drain Is All
In a Muddle.
'Cue half dozen blocks about Dupont
ci'-j'.o include the homes of as many
scientists of national reputation. These
gentlemen of course know each other
aud meet frequently. Not long ago one
of their neighbors began to wonder
whether such intimate intercourse
p.niong scientists was a. good thing,
his cogitation having had its rise in the
following incident:
His little daughter has just reached
the age when she asks 200 questions a
day. About a month ago her father
spoke of some author as lacking the
proper "temperament" for writing on
history. That word "temperament"
apparently took root in the youngster's
mind. What was temperament? She
asked that question twice an hour for
uu entire week.
Finally her father gave her a note to
Professor and sent her off to find
out That scientist answered the que
ry as fCf.ioi.rs: "Temperament is an in
dividual tendency to the rise of a cer
tain-mental state." Father and daugh
ter wrestled with that a little while and
then applied to a second member of
the scientific group for help. No. 2
called temperament "an ensemble of
physical and mental traits arising from
fundamental constitutional differences
in individuals." This p"ut the little
girl's father completely at sea. So No.
3 was tried. His judgment was that
"temperament is the psychic resultant
of the whole organic life of the indi
vidual." Ry this time hope was aban
doned. But when No. 4 volunteered to
mnke it clear the family spirits-re
vived. "Temperament is a general dis
position of the mind," ho wrote, "the
distinctions of which depend on the
dominance of one or the other of the
physiologic.-!! systems."
And no S. .':•■ family dictionary is

ANTISEPTICS.
They Do Not Destroy, It In Said, bnt
Only Arrest Genii Life.
The Edinburgh Scotsman begs leave
to correct the erroneous belief that im
plies that antiseptics can prevent de
cay. Decay may be arrested without
killing the microbe which would pro
duce it. A few drops of a solution of
carbolic acid added to flour paste will
lteep it sweet for a certain time, not
because the- germs in the paste are de
stroyed, but because these germs are
hindered for the time being ' in their
growth ami multiplication and because
the paste is rendered temporarily an
unsuitable soil for the growth of what
ever microbes may fall from the air in
to it.
When the effect of the acid has worn
off and disappeared, we see the paste
going to the bad as rapidly as if it had
not been treated antiseptically at all.
Molds will grow in it, and it will decay
in the fashion familiar to everybody.
It is in this way cold may. act as an
antiseptic when it is used to preserve
meat and fish. There is no destruction,
but only arrest of germ life. If we wish
to kill microbes, therefore, we not only
have to use a disinfectant, but we must
employ it in proper proportions and sea
that It thoroughly attacks the germs
we wish to destroy. It is for this rea
son that all attempts to kill gex - nis
which the air may contain are worse
than useless. We cannot "disinfect" the
nir. If we could do so, we should re
quire to saturate the air with our germ
icide to such an extent that to breathe
it would kill us.
We get an excellent example of this
fallacy of "disinfecting air" when we
reflect that in using burning sulphur to
purify a room after a fever case we
have to use it in such a way and in
such proportion that it is impossible for
any person to remain in tho room at
all.
Hiding nehind Dig; Words.
A mining expert recently described a
lode as traversing "a metamorphic
matrix of a somewhat argilloareuace
ous composition." This means literally
'a changed mass of a somewhat clayey
saudy composition." This in its turn
may be translated into plain English
as m-u-d. :
Why choke a puny fact with mur
derous polysyllables? Huxley and Dar
win, Lyell aud Faraday could so write
as to be "understauded of the people,"
and there is a suspicion abroad in these
times that the big words so freely used
by small men are a device to. conceal
Ignorance and inexact thought rather
than a proof of superior knowledge.—
Youth's Companion.
Test of the Acre of Ersj.
There is a sure and simple test of age
in an egg. Dissolve six ounces of com
mon kitchen salt in a large glassful of
water and drop in your eggs, one at a
time. An egg one day old will sink to
the bottom, but if older it does not
reach the bottom. If three days old, it
sinks only Just below the surface. If
five days and over, it floats; and the
older it is the more it -protrudes from
the water.— New York Press.

your bridle rein is seized by a dirty
boy, who helps you to dismount, shout
ing ioudly meanwhile for the proprie
tor, who presently looms up through
the wilderness of carts and mules. Pro
prietor and boy then hold a parley as
to what rooms are eligible, and then a
door is pushed open and the traveler is
shewn to his apartment. It is usually
about twelve feet square. The walls
and floor are of hard mud, and so are
tho beds, which extend entirely across
the side of the room, with only space
enough between them for a small table
and one chair. The room is lighted by
one window, in which paper takes the
place of "glass! !C-*^~
The first duty of the proprietor in
inakiug a patron comfortable is to step
up the. holes in the paper window pane.
He never tears the paper off entirely
and replaces it with a new one, be
ciuise the sheet- of paper is .worth
about one-tenth of a cent, and the inn
keeper is not wasteful. Indeed he
pastes little slips of paper over the
holes until all the light that filters
through it is of a mottled hue. j
At one end of the mule shed is the
kitchen of the inn. It is here that the
meals for all the patrons are prepared,
to be eaten in the rooms. The menu is
not elaborate. It consists only of bowls
of rice and tea. Should the traveler de
sire a greater variety of food, he can
buy it himself in the market, .und his
own servant can cook it in the kitchen
of the inn. To sleep on the b«l of a
Chinese inn would be for a firtigner
an impossibility were it not that he is
always so exhausted at the s end of
each day's journey that he finds it dif
ficult to remain awake ten minutes
after alighting from his pony. lie lies
down on the mat that covers the hard
heap of mud and surprises himself at
the soundness of his slumber.
Tho one redeeming thing about the
inn is its cheapness. Just as the trav
eler is about to depart in the morning
the proprietor tells him the amount of
his bill. Everything is charged on the
"European plan." Every cup of tea,
every rushlight candle, the paper win
dow pane, are all itemized iv the long
list which the proprietor reels off in
singsong, but the total is surprisingly
low. The cost of food and lodging for
one night for a traveler and two serv
ants, with stabling and fodder for his
ponies and cart mules, is about 50
cents.— New York Mail and Express.
Donated Too Soon.
The rear end of a Fordham car was
congested the other afternoon. There
wasn't even "standing room only." A
jocular commuter said, "Beware of
pickpockets!"
Everybody laughed.
A gentlemanly looking fellow said:
"Xo man need be afraid of. pickpock
ets if he does as I did. I have a self
patented scheme. I have a buttonhole
in my vest pocket. I run my chain
through it and attach the other end in
the usual way. They can't draw that
watch through that buttonhole. No
pickpockets iv mine, and don't you fcr
get it."
The crowd thinned out.
At Wendover avenue the "patentee"
said startingly:
"My watch is gone!"
Somebody had clipped the chain,
drawn it through the other way and
abstracted the watch.— New York
News.
A Story of Two Xecklnces.
When General Weylw was sent by
Spain as governor general to Manila,
Don Carlos Palanca; the wealthy Span
iardized Chinaman, determined to semi
Mrs. weyler a gift, the customary way
of obtaining the good will of tbe Span
ish officials. lie found at a jeweler's
two necklaces, each costing $20,000 and
both being so beautiful that he could
not choose between them. So he sent
'them both to Mrs. Weyler with thi>
message that she should make her
choice. He received a warm letter of
thanks from her, stating that the neck
laces were so beautiful that she could
not decide between them and hence
would keep both, which she did.
Theories About Drowned Bodies.
It was a popular theory in days gone
by that the body of a drowned man
would float the ninth day. Sir Thomas
Browne alludes to it as believed in his
time, anil in his "Pseudo-doxia Epi
demics" there is a discussion on this
fanciful notion. It was also believed
that the spirits of those drowned at sea
were doomed to wander for a hundred
years owing to the rites of burial hav
ing never been properly bestowed upon
their bodies.— Notes and Queries.

"She is the most sacrificin' woman
fer miles around."
"In what way?"
"Waal, whenever they git up a lawn
fete or sumpen like for the church in
which the expenses are rnore'n the pro
ceeds the committee alwus sends her
up to acquaint the pastor with the re
sult."—Baltimore Herald.

tions involved in the elections to be held in these three states. .
