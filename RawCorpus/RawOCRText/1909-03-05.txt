For Diseases of the Skin
Nearly all diseases of tbe skin such
as eczema, tetter, salt rheum and
barbers' itch are characterized by an
intense itching and smarting, which
often makes life a burden and dis
turbs sleep and rest. Quick relief
may be bad by applying Chamber
lain's Salve. It allays tbo itching
and smarting almost instantly. Many
oases bave been cured by its use. For

Struck With a Hammer.
Pierre Authman, an old resident of
Volcano, met with a peouliar accident
Tuesday morning. He was engaged
In niakiDg a fence around bis place,
and a young man named Bonneau
was driving posts into the ground
qsing a sledge hammer for this pur
pope.;; Wblle so: engaged, the head of
the hammer flew off," striking /'Autb
man in the 'head/'* The blow bad
enough steam iv it to raise a big
bump, aud a nasty out. Fortunately
at tbe point of collision the skull
was iluak, so tbat no fraoture of the
skull resulted, Tbe local doctor at
tended and dressed up his wound,
and be was getting along nicely at
last aocounts.

Mrs. Llntlllac Dies.
Mrs Llntillalo, wdo was shot In
both legs by J. (Jloallob last wc||<,
was brought from the Lintillao home
□ear Clinton last Saturday, and
placed in tbe oouoty hospital for
convenience of treatment. It took
about four hours] to convey tbe
patleut tbe seven miles. Tbe journey
was made by spring wagon, and Mr
Lintillao drove very slowly tbe whole
distance, this being absolutely neces
sary for tbe safety of the patient.
However, Mrs Lintillao stood tbe
ordeal well, and reached the hospital
with a little discomfort as was possi
ble under tbe conditions. !
The operation . of taking off tbe
right foot was performed Monday by
Dr. Eodioott assisted by Dr. Gall.
The amputation wna made at tbe
ankle, as tbe liool including the ten
doms, was shot away. Tbe patient
stood tbe ordeal nell, in fact better
than tbe first operation. She is doing
nicely. The attending surgeon says
that with a false foot on one and an
artificial leg on the otber.she wonld be
able to walk around much better, in
fact, than if tbe amputation of the
foot had not been resorted to, even
though she recovered from tbe in
juries in tbe best manner possible
under the circumstances.
Later-The Patient Dies.
The patient touk a decided obaDge
for the worse about three o'clook
Wednesday afternoon. She continued
to sink steadily from tbat time on,
and passed away at half past seven
Thursday morning. The shook to her
system from the shooting and two
amputations within eight days was
more than her * constitution oould
withstand. Her buaband was notified
of ber serious condition— or rather,
word was sent to tbe ranch for him to
oome down— but for some reason he
failed to reach here before tbe end
came. . i ...

The Destructive Worm.
C. E. Froelich reports .that the
native grass crop on his land Is being
seriously affeoted by tbe ravages of
tbe. worm tbat has been playing havoc
in the valleys. . He says it resembles
the angle worm, .although Dot
Identical; It seems to' attack the
roots of tbe grass causing tbe vegeta
tion to perish. They do Dot show on
the surf ace, but on removing a stone
or other form of shelter they are
found. . In some places the grass has
been utterly destroyed. ' It is not so
bad as tbat in this seotion, still
cattlemen are very apprehensive at
the outlook. Samples of the pest
bave been sent to tbe state etymologist
for examination and report, in the
hope that an adequate remedy may be
discovered to counteract tbe plague.
Tbe worms seem to be slowly work-
Ing their way eastward into the foot

In the valleys tor tbe past three years,
and tbe destruction from their opera

nounced each year. ' ,

Defender— F. B. Joyce, Iho super
intendent of this mine, was in Jack
son early tbis week. Tbe mine is
still shut down, on aooount of the
difficulty iv obtaining fuel. It may
be two or three weeks before opera

setts next month. The company is
contemplating- - installing ■ electric
power forboistlng and other purposes
and also maobine drills. The under

of those conversant with tbe property,
justify these improvements.

Another Pioneer Gathered Home.
■ Alpbeus Yoak, another of Amador
county's pioneers, died at his home
at Butte City yesterday morning,'
about three o'olook. Death was the
outcome of. tbe infirmities incident
to old age. He was a [native of Vir
ginia, aged 78 years. He came to
California in the early days of the
gold excitement, and about 1850 or' 51
settled 'in the vloln i ty of ■; J acksoD,
and hua lived in this JneighprlVood
ever since. His wife died, about two
years ago, and l" since .that event he
failed in health 'rapidly. Neighbors
ministered to his wants as far.: as
possible, and one of the Mnrpby' sand
Stewarts were' with him when the end
came. He served four years as coroner
and publio administartor, nearly
twenty years ago, and sinoe has made
a living by raising stock and keeping
a roadside saloon at Butte. He has
relatives, we are informed, in the
east. The funeral will be beld to
morrow. ■"

Fred Lcmoin has been notified to tender his resignation as
steward of the county hospital by the first of next month, or
r&ther by the next meeting of the board. Nothing appears
in the official minutes to this effect, and therefore the notifi*
cation does not come as the action of the board. But it is
generally understood that the democratic majority of the
board of supervisors has mapped out a program to oust the
present republican incumbent in charge of the hospital, and
put one of their partisans in his place, and they have taken
this method of conveying to Lemoin the knowledge of such
intention to remove him. A member of the board, in a pri
vate capacity, served the notification or intimation that it
would be well to voluntarily resign his position. No reasons
are given as far as the conduct of the hospital is concerned
for making the change. It is purely a matter of party
politics. There are hungry democrats clamoring for the job,
and therefore the change. It is not a question of improving
the management of the institution, for it is conceded that
hospital affairs, whether from the standpoint of the comfort of
the inmates, or the interests of the taxpayers, have been
better looked after during the past four years than at any
previous period in its history. The inmates are satisfied, the
public in general is satisfied to let well enough alone. If
the proposition were referred to a popular vote Lemoin would
be retained in his place by an overwhelming majority, But
the democrats have four years of uninterrupted control of
the county's affairs before them, and they cannot afford, in
the dearth of fodder in the pasture field under their control
to let this berth go by unappropriated by one of their own
following. While believingthat from a broad-gauge stand
point of public welfare the contemplated change is an im
politic one — one that will be almost universally denounced;
still from the exigencies of party politics do fault can be
found. The democrats are in power, democrats want the
place, "to the victors belong the spoils," is the party slogan.
It is not often that politicians, particularly of the democratic
persuasion, can refrain from placing party interests fiist,
and public interests second under such circumstances.
The invitation to resign, coming in the unofficial way, may
be ignored. Perhaps that is all the attention that will be
paid to it by the party concerned. Every act of this kind,
if intended to have any practical effect, should have a place
on the official records. There is no doubt, however, that the
whole matter has been discussed by the majority of members
on the board, and the successor to Lemoin decided upon. It
is common rumor that three applicants are in the field for the
position, namely, W. K. McFarland, A. B. McLaughlin, of
Volcano, and D. Burke of Plymouth. The latter was severe
ly hurt by being caught between two joints of water pipe
some time ago in the neighborhood of Plymouth. It is be
lieved that his chances of receiving the appointment are the
brightest.
If Lemoin sends in his resignation in response to the un
official request, of course thatwould be made a matter of re
cord, and would tend to clear the situation from the demo
cratic standpoint. They would meet objections by v saying
we did not turn down an admittedly capable public servant;
he resigned. On the other hand, if he fails to resign, the
probable outcome will be that the office of steward, etc., will
be declared vacant, and thereupon the democratic favorite
will be appointed to fill it. While this may be a very
mortifying experience to one against whose official record
no flaw can be found, it throws upon the democratic majority
the full and undivided responsibility for their action.
Assemblyman Moore's bill, changing the law in regard to
the compensation of county officers in Amador county, has
passed the assembly. We presume this is the bill raising
the salary of the county superintendent of schools from
$1200 to $1500 per annum. There will be little objection to
this increase, which is generally conceded to be just. If
Other changes are made , of the up-grade character, there
would certainly be a loud protest, Salaries are high enough
in every other instance, and in some cases might be pruned
down a little with out injustice to any one.
The state labor commissioners Have just issued their re
port for 1908. It contains a mass of information relating to
all branches of industry in California. In regard to the
wages paid a comparative table is given showing the wages
paid in the different branches of organized labor for 1906 and
1907 the period before and after the great San Francisco dis
aster. This shows that in forty trades the wages paid in
January 1907 were from 11 to forty per cent higher than the
corresponding month in 1906, Only four blanches of labor
suffered a decline in the wage schedule during this period,
namely, elevator conductors and stationary engineers, mar
ble cutters and painters.

NAVAL DISCIPLINE.
What the Sailor Will Do to Obtain
Shore Leave.
As illustrating how men respond and
adjust themselves to reward, or, what
comes to tho same thing, the maximum
satisfaction for a given amount of ef
fort, two instances that came under
my observation while in the navy are
very interesting. One cruise was made
on a vessel whose executive officer was
in most respects a very able man.
Discipline in general was admirable.
In arranging for shore leave of the
enlisted men, however, he managed so
to arrange matters, strange as it may
seem, that It was possible for a man
In an Inferior conduct grade to get
more liberty than one of the best be
haved men. This was of course en
tirely unnatural and camo about from
a combination of two separate systems.
The reason was that naval regulations
compelled the giving of at least a cer
tain amount of shore leave to men in
the second grade, -while tbo system he
was uslnff actually allowed less to a
man in the first grade. The result was
that In a short time tbo bulk of the
men were in the second conduct grade
where they could get the most liberty.
At a later date, on another ship, the
executive officer was an extremely
able man, who had studied this ques
tion more carefully and was a great
believer in making it worth while for
the men to behave themselves and
keep in a high conduct grade. He so
arranged matters that if any man be
haved himself sufficiently well and
did all his work with high efficiency
he could have an unusual amount of
liberty. The result was that this ship
had more than hnlf Its crew in what
Is known as the "special first class,"
far and away the largest percentage
that ever came under my observation.
—Walter M. McFarland in Engineer
ing Magazine.
EXPERT PLAYERS.
Four Ladies and an Interesting At
tempt at Whist.
The following conversation was over
heard by a waiter at a ladies' club.
The man was able to use his knowl
edge of shorthand to take notes, hav
ing once been a reporter:
"Jane," said Maria, "it is your lead."
"Why, no," answered Jane; "It is
Ida's."
"No," spoke up Ida; "It is not my
lead. .Susan dealt tho cards."
"Why, then, It must be my lead,"
said Maria. "What's trumps?"
"Hearts 1" shouted three young voices
In unison.
"Well, there is my lead," said Maria,
playing* the deuce of clubs.
"But you must lead a trump card,
my dear," cried Jane. ■
"Yes, and lead the biggest trump
you have In your hand," put in Ida,
Jane's partner. • ■ .
"Well, then, here Is the j q\ieen of
hearts," said Maria.
"Oh, you mean thing, you!" exclaim
ed Jane. "That takes my. king." ..
"But I will take the trick, for I have
the ace," said Ida.
"But," remarked Susan, "that is the
ace of diamonds."
"So it is," said Ida. "Well, here is
the four of hearts."
"I've got the ace of hearts," purred
Susan. "Does that take the trick?"
"Of course it does," answered Jane.
"No, it doesn't," said' Ida. "A court
card always takes another card."
"Oh, let's stop playing!" cried Maria
wearily. "It's no fun when there are
no men to tell you how to play."—

Banks.
It was In the City of Brotherly Love
that the first bank was established in
1781. It was Incorporated by congress
under the name of "The President, Di
rectors and Company of the Bank of
North America.". Three years later the
second bank In the country was opened
In Boston and called the Massachu
setts bank.-
In the same year the Bank of New
York was founded.
The first United States bank was
founded In 1785 and the second in
1810, In which year the first savings
banks were established, one In Phila
delphia, the other in Boston.— Scrap

Inadvisable.
During a snowstorm on the Highland
railway a train wus held up for an
hour or two. The guard, a cheery
Scot, passed along the carriages trying
to keep up the spirits of the passen

plained that if tho train didn't go on
he would "die of cold."
"Tak* my advlco an' no* dae that,"
replied the guard. "Mln" _y\ we

Sour Milk.
The milk was not of the desired

The Duel.
Gaston burst like a whirlwind in
upon Ills friend Alphonse. "Will you

"Going to fight?"
"No; going to get married."
Alphonse after a pause inquired,
"Can't you apologize?"— Argonaut.

take a cold; a few dosos of Kennedy's

the cold by driving it from the system

Too Many Gamblers.
It has heen noticed that the gambl
ing fraternity bas been receiving
large rccossiour to their ranks of late.
This flocking bitherward is taken as
indicating that this city is lively in
comparison with other parts; that
notwithstanding all tbe talk about
hard times, the depression bas not as
a matter of fact interfered notice
ably with the business interests of
this community. Gamblers gather
wherever times are good, and abund
ance of ready money iv circulation.
At any rate, this class has been
perceptibly reinforced during the
past two or three weeks, . and the
attention of the authorities has been
drawn thereto On Wednesday even
ing all open gambling in tbe saloons
was stopped by the sheriff. The
object being to rid the town of this
undesirable class, or at least to re
duoe it within reasonable limits.
With the shut-down on their games
there is nothing left for them to do
but to depart . for other fields, and
this ■ course several have already
takeu, and others will follow suit
sboitly. It is claimed that from
fifteen to twenty gamblers have flock
ed here iflithiu the past couple of;
weeks. They add nothing to th'd
wealth of' the' community, and thoir
business is to gather in tbe shekels
without giving value therefor.

IMPORTANT SUPERIOR
COURT DECISION
On Tax Sale Case.
Mendenhall vs. Gregory.
Id tbe aupetlor court of the atate
of California, In aod for tbe county
of AniHflor.
Asa V. Mondenhnll. plaintiff, vs
U. B. Uregory, as l»x collector of the
county of Amodor, defendant/.
I'hia ia a proceeding for a writ of
mandate against the defendant as tax
oolleotor of Amador county to, require
him upou payment of $'Zn6,to exeoute
to the plaintiff a deed conveying all
tbe interest of Ibe state of California
In and to tbe Liaat Cbanoe, quaitz
mine, tbe Eclipse quartz mine, and
Eolipae Extension quartz minr, all
within said county of Amador.
Plaintiff in his petition has alleged
facts showing that said property was
assessed for state and, county, taxes;
that on May Ist, ISKKI, was sold to tbe
state of California for non-payment
of taxes, penalties and coats, amount
ing to 2972.21. That, on December 12.
1903, tbe controller of the state of
California, under the provisions of
sec 3897 of tbe Political code, by a
written authorization directed the du
fendant as eucb tax collector to sell
tbe snid property at public auction,
In separate parcels, to tbe highest
bidder for cash in lawful money of
,United£States upon giving the notice
required by said section 3807 of the
political code. That after ttio publi
cation of tbe requited notice, at the
time appointed for the sale, the de
fendant stated "that be would read
tbe notice of sale if there was any
one present who desired that, it
should be read;" that thereupon tbe
parties present waived reading of \he
notice, and tbe defendant then stated
"that the purpose of said notice of
sale was to sell tbe parcels of pro
perty, but that be bad received pro
tests for and against tbe making of
tbe sale. That thereupon plaintiff
objeoted to any postponement of the
sulo, and offered S2!)7!j for ali o£ said
property (that being an amount equal
to tbe sum total of the taxes, special
road taxes, total penalties for de
linquenoy, costs, interest and cost of
publication of uotico of sahO; that
plaintiff made a tender of said sum
of $2975 to plaintiff, and demanded a
deed; that no other bid was ottered,
and tbe defendant thereupon post
poned the sale and refused to exeoute
deed." It is not alleged in d|rect
terms in tbe petition that deed for
said property was over executed to
tbe state, although such a recital Is
contained in tbe order of tliu .con
troller directing tbe sale.
No point is made by detetidant,
however, a3 to tbe sufficiency uf the
complaint in this particular.
The defendant has demurred to tbe
petition upou tbo ground that it does
not state facts sufficient to out i tie
plaintiff to tbe relief demanded, and
also has set up many special aud
technical grounds ot demurrer, none
of which I deem to be well taken.
There is no provision of tbe statute
in express terms giving either tbe
controller or tbe tax collector power
to postpone a sale of this cuaiaoter,
and neither has such power been
questioned in any court of this state,
so far as known to court aud counsel.
Plaintilf has cited many authorities
supporting the dootriue that mtulumus
will lie to compel . the performance
of a duty enjoined upou a ministerial
officer, and our own code of civil
procedure, soation 1085, provides that
it may be issued to oompel the per
formanoo of au act which tbe law
specially enjoins as a duty resulting
from an office, trust or station. It
the facts set out in the petition are
sufficient to show that plaintiff be
came entitled to a deed from too tax
collector upon tbe tender of the sum
of $2975. the writ of maudate will
Issue requiring tbe defuuduut as sucb
tax collector to issue to plaintiff a
deed upon the payment of such sum
of 129/5. /
That where a sale has been actually
made and the officer has refused to
execute a deed, he may be required
to do so by the- court, is fully sus
tained in' McMillan, vs. Kichards, 9
Cal.. 3G5.
Plaintiff has cited Desty ou Taxa
tion, to the effect tlmt a tax sale,
made other than tit 'tbo time notified
will be void, but 1 think it will be
found that this rule applies ouly
when there, is some statutory regula
tion fixing date of sale or no legal
notice given of postponement. Mr
Freeman in his notes on "Adjourn
ment of Kxeoatloa and Judicial
Bales." iv Fraaruan vs. Fraaman, 97
Am. Bt. Kep., 055, says, "The officer
conducting a tax sale, unless tbe
statute leaves him no discretion, has
power to make an ndjournineut.
Ordinarily, however, statutes provid
ing that tax sales may be continued
from day to day until completed ap
pear to prohibit any other adjourn
ment except from day. to day "
in Comtek va Hill; 127 Cal. 16(1,
tbe judgment debtor has appealed
from the order of tbe superior court
for refusing to let aside a sale under
foreclosure, by a commiflsloner, and
the supreme court there cay, "While
there, may be oircamstances that
would justify an officer in postponing
a sale, It la clearly not an abuse of
discretion In all caeca to refuee auch
postponement." ', '
As to the power of a public officer
to postpone an auction sale It la eald
in vol. 20 Am. and Eng. Ency. of
Law, pnge tiV.l, (Ist edition) "A
trustee, mortgagee, or public" bffioer
charged with the duty of making
sales under powers, baa always by
Implication the power to adjourn the
sale to a future day or from time to
time, if In his judgment the interest
of tbe parties will be promoted by
so doing and if b* sees tlint a proper
sale can not be made at the time ad
vertised it would be not merely his
privilege, but hia duty to postpone
the sale."
The same rule is laid down ns to
the power of trustees under a deed of
trust, to postpone a sale, in a note to
Tyler vs Henning on page 291, in vol.
10 American state Keports.
■ in the above mentioned note to
IVraaman vs Fraaman, at page 653, it.is
said:
"It has long been the practice in
tbe American Commonwealths, where
an officer in charge of an exoutiou or
judicial sale finds that the property
is about to be sacrificed, to order an
adjournment, and tbe law recognizes
the authority of the officer, |in tbe
exercise of a sound discretion, .to
change both tbe time andplaoe of
tbe sale when for any reason it can
not, consistently with the rights of
tbe parties or tbe performance of hia
official duties, take place as original
ly appointed," citing Phillips vs.
(Jonover, 251 11. 309, and numerous
other oases.
The preponderance of authorities
seems to establish the right of an
officer obarged with tbe duty v
making a sale to postpone tbe same
for cause.
Estate of Leonia, 133 Cal., 195,
cited by plaintiff, has no application
to this case. That was a case where
an administrator bad leceived and
accepted the bid of a purchaser, and
tbe superior oourt had not ouly re
fused to confirm tbe sale, but vacated
tbe orddr directing a sale, and this
the supremo oourt deoided the lower
court had no right or authority to do,
hut had lost jurisdiction to set aside
the order of sale. "
With tbe utmost research 1 have
been unable to discover but three
cases in United States where an order
bns been sought as in tbis case, com
manding an officer to acoept a bid
mid execute a deed. '
In blossom vs. The Milwaukee and
Chioago Railroad Company, :i Wallace
196, tbe marshal under a decree' of
forclosure and bad advertised bjro
erty for sale at auction;' inoasoru'was
tbe only bidder, and tbe 'marshal' re
fused acceptance of the bid -and, ad
journed the sale. Blossom thereupon
applied to the oourt to have the sale
confirmed to him, and in denying him
any ' relief the supreme ' court of
United States, quoting from Fayne
vs. Cave, T. X., 140. said:' "Biding
at an auction is nothing more' than
an offer on one side until it had re
ceived the nssuut of tbe auctioneer as
of the agent of tbe owner." And
further, quoting from tttc/ry on Bales,
it said :
"Speaking of ordinary auction
sales, at au auction the author 'says,
'that tbe seller may -withdraw the
goods or the bidder may retract- hia
bid at any time before they are struck
off, and tbe reason assigned for tbe
rule is, that so long as tbe final con
sent of both parties is not signified
by tbe blow of the hammer there Is
no mutual agreement to a 'definite
proposition."
- In Mills vs. Law, 73 A. Decisions,
92, (South Carolina) tbe commission
er on a partition sale refused to
accept tbe highest bid, bnt postponed
tbe sale, and the oourt there in deny
ing the rights ot tbe bidder to compel
a conveyance, said:
"Whether the commissioner render
ed bimselt liable, as for bis 'miscon
duct, in refusing to keep up the
bidding and to close a contract with
tbe bidder upon his bid, or not, it is
certain that no contract was closed
with him, and he is not entitled to
have a conveyance."
Jn Tillman vs. Dunuian, 114 Ga.,
106. reported in vol. 68 Am. Bt. Ke
ports at page .28, the petitioner had
filed '■'■■ petition requiring the ex
ecutors of a will to execute to .him a
deed for certain laud. It there ap
peared that certaiu property of tbe
estate bud been ottered at public sale,
petitioner bid a certain sum which
was accepted by the auctioneer, and
thereupon upon order, of the exe
cutors and against the protest of
tbe plaintiff, the land was withdrawn
from sale and tbe executors of tbe
will refused to accept plaintiff's
money or execute a deed.
A demurrer was sustained to the
petition, and the oourt iv sustaining
tbe demurrer, said:
"Tbe questions to he determined
iv tbis oase are: Whether au exaoutor
baa tbe right to withdraw; property
from sale at public outcry by au
auctioneer employed by the executor,
nnd.hida. aro. received nnd cried be
fore the tame ia knocked Off to the
highest bidder; and whether tbe high
est bidder in such a case acquires any
right, by reaaon of hia bid to oompel
the executor to accept the same and
make him a deed upon tbe tender of
the amount so bid ....
It la well settled law that a bidder
at an auction sale may withdraw hia
bid even after It haa been cried, at
any time before the hammer falls on
the propory is knocked off to him
The auctioneer ia the agent of tbe
vendor, and the assent of the both
partlea la necessary to make tbe con
tract; that Is signified by the seller
by knocking down the hammer. , A
. . . Every bidding is nothing
more than an offer on one side, which
Is not binding on either side till it is
assented to."
Tbe three above mentioned cases
were all ranch stronger cases for tbe
petitioner than is the case here, for
in each of those oases, confirmation
of tbe sale bad to be made, by tbe
court before any deed could be made,
and tbe petitioner in each case was
seeking for an order of the court re
quiring tbe officer vested with power
to sell to acoept bis bid.
No sucb proposition confronts us
in this oiiso. for the tax oollector is
not required, upon making a sale, to
report it for confirmation to any
otllcer,but upon such sale and receipt
of tbe amount of the bid he is re
quired to at once exeoute a deed to
tbe purchaser.
in each of the three last mentioned
oaaea. in determining the rights of
the petitioner to compel a convey
ance, reference was had to the laws
governing auction sales. As tbe
etatute here prescribes that the tax
collector must make tbe sale at public
auction in determining whether plain
tiff is entitled to a writ we may look
for Informaton to tbe laws regulating
auction sales. Thus in llibernia U.
and L. Soo. vs. Bebke, 121 Cal. 342,
the supreme court of tbis state de
cided that at a sale upon a decree ot
foreclosure, tbe bidder was entitled to
withdraw bis bid before it was ac
cepted, because tbe sale was by auc
tion, and tbe rules of auction sales
was, that tbe bidder may withdraw bis
bid at any time before the hammer
falls.
Tested by tbe law governing auction
sales, there was never . in tbis case
even an offer on tbe part of tbe tax
collector to sell the property, much
less the acceptance of a bid, or the
making of a sale. 'Under tbe authori
zation of sale from tbe state control
ler the defendant was dircoted to sell
tbe property in separate paroels,. and
no offer was submitted by plaintiff
for any separate parcel. Furthermore,
section 38ti9 political code provides
that tbe deed by tho tax collector
upon a sale "shall reoite tbe facts
necessary to authorize such sale and
conveyance," and tbe tax collector
could not truthfully reoite that Jio
bad sold tbe land or offered it for salo
either as. a whole or in parcels.
Mandamus cannot be resorted to for
tbe purpose of compelling tbe de
livery of a deed containing recitals ot
what occurred at a sale contradictory
ofjtho bhenfl'a return, whioti|be claims
is cotiect iv point of fact.
Hewell vs. Lane, 53 Cal., 217.
Plaintiff quotos Merrill on Man
damus, to tbeeft'eot: "That where
an officer has neglected to do bis
duty utitit tbe time for action by him
sua sponte has expired, tbe writ will
still issue and in that sense alone
may be considered to bave given a
new authority." Conceding this to
be the law in tbis state it is not
suiaciout authority to entitle plaintiff
to tbe writ demanded here, for even
though defendant had no power to
postpone the sale, the moat that
plaintiff could claim would be a writ
commanding defendant to proceed
and make the sale under his said
order from tbe controller. It is not
an authority authorizing tbis court to
command defendant to exeoute a deed
reoiting a sale, when in truth no sale
was ever held.
The defendant's demurrer Is sus
tained, with leave to plaintiff, if be
so desires, to amend bis petition to
show tbe execution of tbe deed to the
state. - -Tbe petition for the writ may
be denied. Defendant to recover his
costs herein. >;

today than he was yesterday.

Whatever change may occur in tbe
quantity of money in any community,
time will adjust the derangement
produced; but while tbat adjustment
is progressing all suffer more or leas
and very many lose everything that
renders life desirable. And no duty
Is more imperative iv the government
than that of furnishing the people a
sound and uniform currency.
Ere long tbe moat valuable of all
arts will be tbe art of deriving a
comfortable subsistence from tbe
smallest; area of soil.
All should share tbe privileges of
government wbo assist in bearing its
burdens, consequenly 1 would admit
all whites to tbe rights of euifragn
who pay taxes or bear arms, by uo
means excluding females.
To secure to eaoh laborer the wbole
product of his labor, or as nearly as
possible, is a worthy object of any
good government. With some men
liberty means for each man to do an
he pleases with himself and the pro
duct of bis labor; with others it means
to do as they please with other men
and the product of other men's
labors. That issue will continue iv
this country when my poor tongue
shall be silent. It is tbe eternal
struggle between rigbt and' wrong.
The common rigbt of humanity and
the divine right of kings. In what
ever shape it develops itself it is tbe
same tyrannical spirit that says:
"You toll and work, and earn bread
and I'll eat it."
No men living are more worthy to
be trusted than those wbo toil np
from poverty. Let tbem beware of
surrendering a political power wbiok
they already possess and wbicb, if
surrendered, will surely be used to
close tbe door of advancement against
such as they, and to fix new disabili
ties aud burdens upon tbem. till all
of liberty shall be lost.

'ibe one great living principle of

A free people iv times of peace and

At fsuch times tbe man wbo is for

Tbe production on a screen of
pbotographio pictures in natural
colors has been greatly simplified by
tbe oamera-stereoptioon .of Andre
Überon, a French' experimenter. All
successful pictures of this kind so far
have depended on the "tbtee-oulor
process." in which three negatives
are made under soreens of tbe three
primary colors, mid tbe three
pictures are in some way superposed
or combined so an to be seen in a
single view. Tbe new apparatus is
a small camera divided Into three
compartments arranged in a triangle.
Three object lenses of equal focus are
placed in front of tbe compartments,
and eaoh Is provided with an appro
priate colors screen. With a lens of
proper focus fitted into a ring that
surrounds tbe three objectives, three
different single-color negatives of tbe
same objeot are taken on a single
plate. To project the views, a posi
tive is inserted in place of tbe nega
tive, a strong light is thrown upon
tbe plate from behind, and a suitable
lens in tbe ring around the three ob
jeotives concentrates and automatical
ly superposes the three images on a
projection screen. Though there is
some slight blurring, tbe colored
pictures so obtained are brilliant and
pleasing.
Kerro-silicon, now coming into ex
tensive use as a ready means of add
ing silicon to certain grades of steel,
is produoed by beating in the eleotrio
furnace a mixture of iron ore, quartz,
coke and lime. When wet it gives off
muoh pbospboretted hydrogen, arse
uiureted hydrogen and other gas, and
tbe death of five Hussian immigrants
last December, while passengers in
tbe steerage of a steamer from Ant
werp to Urimsbv, has been traced to
poisonous emanations from a cargo of
this material.
An arrangement of a ship's lights
in a definite triangle on a known plan
is urged by D. il. Sbuttleworth-
Brown as a safe guard against collis
ion. The lights would then show
an observer on another' ship the
vessel's course, her distance from tbe
observer, and her approximate spoed.
Not least Interesting of accidental
discoveries is the now method of
rapidly converting metals into ribbon
form, which was hit upon by Mr
Gilbert, a British chemist, while
seeking some way 'of making white
lead without handling. The molten
metal is dropped upon a rapidly re
volving drum filler! with cold water,
and from the surface of the dium it
shoots out at tbe rate of twenty miles
an hour, as delicate silvery ribbon,
1-500 to 1-1000 of ao loch thick, bo
cooled that it can be caught in tbe
baud. ■ In this way metal ribbon can
bejproduoed at an expense of 85. D0 or
810.00 a ton, or perhaps a twentieth
of the cost of making zino turnings
by the old method. Numerous ap
plications are expected, as ribbons ot'
lead will take the place of lead sbav
lugs or turnings for packing joints
and bearings and other purposes, zino
ribbon will probably be useful in tbe
oyanide treatment of gold ores, and
in chemical Industries various metals
will be brought into solution more,
quickly. when first made into ribbon*

A new dwelling proposed at the late
bygienio congress in Berlin is to have
eaob successive story narrowed from
three to six feet, with several feet of
balconies to widen tbe terraoes thus
formed. This plan, recommended
particularly for eauatoriums and
houses for tbe poorer people, provides
an abundance of air and light/for
eaob story, and supplies an open
apace for recreation out of doors. As
v material for buildings of this bind,
reiuforoed concrete has hygienic' aud
other advautajjes.
The United States is wearing down
at the average rate of one inoh in 7CO
years. This result is computed from
twenty yeura of stream gaug lug and
water analysis by the Geologioal Sur
vey tbe Engineer Corps uf tbe Army,
and tbe Weather Bnreau, supplement
ed by some state aud municipal work.
Tbe streams carry off eaoh year an
average of 87 tons of dissolved solids
and 100 tons of suspended matter for
eaoh square mile of surface—equival
ent to a total of '270,000,000 tons of
dissolved aud 613,000,000 tons of sus
pended mutter.
Fatigue has been shown to bo a
poisoning of the body through tbe
accumulation of waste products under
oeitaln conditions, aud some twenty
years ago Prof. Mosso, of 'i'urlu,
found that i.hn Illness sometimes fol
lowing tbe eatlua of the flosb of game
or cattle la due to over fatigue of the
anlmali at Mm time of slaughter. The
aotlve agent was found to be n epeolflo
toxlne Instead of an alkaloid, like
the strychnine mid braolne produced
by plants. The toxlne wna. Isolated
by Dr. Welohert, and proved to aot
as an antitoxine In small injections,
wiillo large injections produced the
symptoms of fatigue, followed by
death. A linn of German chemists
has now produced an antidote for
fatigue by a simpler method than ex
ttaotlug it from fatigue muscles.
When albumen is broken up by
heating ten hours with very dilute
nitric noid, one of tbe products gives
tbe physiological effects of fatigue,
and long beating or boiling destroys
tlila poison, yielding a substance
that neutralizes Its action. Tbe
antitoxine Is separated by dialyzlng
through a porous membrane and ex
tracting with acetone. It may be in
jected into tbe body, and is churned
to neutialized fatigue, preventing
injurious etieots.
The introduction of magazine rifles
Into the army is said to have ended
the custom of using the rifle as a
telephone by placing tbe muzzle to
the ground and listening at tbe
breech for the movement of distant
cavalry. A new apparatus on tbe
same principle is tbe aooustele of
M. Muriel, a French inventor. This
is a trumpet shaped tube a yard or
more high, inclosing a central oone,
and it is claimed to be so sensitive
that tbe tick of a watch can be hoard
several hundred yards away. In
listening for sounds through tbe
earth, it is best placed in a speoial
hole.

OLD TIME TURKEY EAT
A Once Popular Feast In the
Pennsylvania Mountains. '
GONE WITH THE WOODSMEN.
The People, Traditions and Associa
tions That Made It Possible Are No
More, and It Joins In Oblivion the
Apple Cut and Quilting Bee.
"It Isn't because there is no more
material in the Blue mountain region
of Pennsylvania to provide a turkey
cut tlint we have bad the last of those
famous festivities," said a former
dweller of the district described, "for
there nro still wild turkeys a-plenty.
"The turkey eat has gone out with
the passing of the people whose homes,
traditions and manner of life made It
possible and with the occupation that
was once theirs.
"In the days when the turkey eat
was the great winter festivity lv tbe
mountain districts between the Schuyl
klll and the Junlata watersheds the
sparse population was chiefly of rude
and rugged woodmen and their fami
lies, many of thorn descendants of
pure Pennsylvania Dutch stock. Scores
of thorn depended almost entirely on
tlielr skill with gun nnd trap for their
food supply.
"The cabins of these mountaineers
were built of logs, tho chinks between
which were filled in with clay. A
huge stone chimney rose at one end
of the cabin outside, covering that en
tire end, while on the inside it opened
on a broad fireplace across that- end
of the room.
"The cabin was banked all around
with earth, against which hemlock and
pine boughs were heaped. Sometimes
rows of cord wood were piled up al
most to the eaves, the better to keep
out the cold, which Is always intense
during winter on those wind swept
hills.
"There was rarely a cabin with more
than one room. The walls were dark
and smoky, and from rafter or beam
hung plentifully strips of Jerked veni
son and chunks of smoked bear meat,
along with hams and bacon from the
family pigs fattened In the woods and
.almost as wild as the bear and' the
deer. But the choicest and best bo
loved thing of the cabin's larder was
the fat and well frozen wild turkey.
"While the woodsman's cabin was al
ways prepared for a turkey eat, it
never knew when it was coming. A
turkey eat began with the making up
of a party In a neighboring village or
settlement. Taking along a fiddler,
they would appear nt this, that or the
other woodsman's cablu of a winter
evening, and the woodsman and his
family did the rest.
"Instantly the birch wood pall of ci
der came forth. While the cabin's
guests drank cider the host prepared
and spitted the turkey over the hick
ory coals in the fireplace to roast for
the feast. When it was ready for the
table it was' placed before the guests
on a big tin platter. Each one carved
for himself, the plates being squares
of birch bark.
"The turkey eat was not complete,
though, without a liberal supply of
'paan haas' and head cheese, and with
it went the sweetest of ryebread and
butter. Taan haas Is a strictly Penn
sylvania Dutch creation.
"It Is made from the rich juices left
after boiling the ingredients for head
cheese, these being thickened to a stiff
paste with buckwheat flour. This paste'
is pressed In forms until cold and Is
served in slices. It Is a dull blue In
color, very rich and very good.
"After the feast tho turkey eat was
rounded out by a night of jollity super
induced by the fiddle and maintained
by It In its music for the old fashioned
cotillon figures and reels, which were
danced until the gray of morning.
"But most of those old time woods
men have passed away, and on those
who are still dwellers in the mountains
the game laws have forced a situation
that leaves them with their ancient oc
cupation gone, and the hunt being no
longer a source of maintenance its tra
ditions have departed with it. The
newer generation of these people is of
other tastes and associations, so while
the wild turkey Is yet In proximity In
that Blue mountain region to supply
the material for the festive turkey eat
.the traditions and associations that
I made it possible are no more, and it Is
gone, like the apple cut, the quilting
bee, the pig killing frolic and others of
the old time rural pastimes that are
now but a memory."— New York Sun. •

Philip and the Ethiopian— Acts
viii:26-40.
Golden Text— Ye search the Scrip
tures beoause ye think that in them
ye have eternal life; and these are
they which bear witness of me— John
v:39.
Verse 20— When Ood f directs us by
circumstances or'b'y' a" friend, or by
an angel, is it just uh much from Uod
as though tie spHke to us directY
1 DO not know whether this angel
was a devout man, or woman, or a
mental pioture. or a dream,- or a
spirit; but he, she or it, convinced
Philip, that God wanted him to go
south; now bow did Philip know that
the impression to go south was of
God; and how may we knuw under
similar ciruumstaucesY (This question
must be answered in writing by mem
bers of the club).
May any person who is not playing
double with God, safely trust "the
Inward voice," to direct as to out
ward circumstances?
Verses 27, 28— Philip found that he
bad nof£oome on a fool's errand;
now is it not invariably so, that re
sults of to-moirow, always justify the
faith vision of to-day.
Seeing thiii Ethiopian was a man
of exalted position, in a foreign
oountry, what was tbe siguiticauce of
Philip being sent to him.
Verse 29-Wben Philip saw this
man's cbariot looming up In tbe dis
tanoe, perhaps after days or weeks ot
waiting, with more or less doubt; be
got tbe impression that this was his
opportunity; now from whom did he
get tho impression?
With what sort of a voloe did tbe
Holy Spirit speak to Philip.
If we.[»hould learn that tbe Holy
Spirit used tbe circumstances, and
Philip's reasoning processes, bis hope
and bis fears, as God's voice, would
that be leally tbe voioe of tbe Holy
Spirit, as if words Were spoken by
Uod out of tbe clouds.
It is always safe for us to do as tbe
Holy Spirit tells us, as in this case.
Verse 30— Was tbli Ethiopian a
devout man.
If a ujhu devoutly searches the
first word, tbe answers must all be !■
possession of tbls paper within tw«
weeks of the olose of this period,
3. Each question must be answered
separately, and the paper written on
one side only. Mo answer must ex*
ceed 200 words in length, and may b«
less. Kach answer must have tho name
and address- .of the writer at the bot
tom of tbe answer.
4, Students should be careful to nn
derstaud tbe question before answer
ing. To do this, the lesson text mast
be lend, and especially tbe verse or
versos upon which tbe question is
based.
5. The answers from this local club
must be delivered to this ulllco, and
they will bo collated at tbe close ot
tbe contest, aud forwarded to head
quarters for independent examination
by competent examiners. Ibe prizes
will then be swarded according to the
highest number of marks won by
members of tbe International News
paper Uililo Study Club, and prizes
which may be awarded to members of
this local club will be given out from
this office.

for what it is awarded, and in like
manner eaoh Hible and book will be

All who oan write aud have ideas
are urged to take up these studies re
gardless ot the degree of their educa
tion,as the papers are not valued from
an educational or literary standpoint,
but from the point of view of the co
gency of their reasoned ideas.
Scriptures, is he sure to find God.
If a man devoutly searches tbe book
of nature, with a desire to obey her
laws is be sure to find God.
Verses 31-34— Where in tbe Bible is
the passage which the was
reading.
Is it always necessary, that some
one should explain the Scriptures to
us.
Can we understand tbe Scriptures
or gee the full import ot any fact,
without tbe aid of tbe Holy Spirit.
Why could not, or why did not, tbe
Holy Spirit explain this Scripture to
tbe Ethiopian direot.
Aa a matter of fact, was not the*
Holy bpirit guiding tbe Ethiopian as
mnch as he was Philip.
Was Isaiah conscious when be wrot*
these words, that they applied to
Jesus; or did he think that he wus
describing some other person or per
sons.
Did not tbe prophets, as other in
spired men often write more wisely
than they knew.
Verses 35-38— Did this Ethiopian
need "converting" tbe same as a wil
ful sinner, or did he, as a devout
child of Uod, simply recognize Jesus
as tbe sent of Uod, and whs then bap
tized in his name.
Verses 39, 40— Was Philip, so to
speak "spirited" away, or did fa*
leave in a natural manner.

OREGON'S EXPERIMENT.
Oregon has a grievance against E. H. Harriman. -Much
fertile land is; undeveloped and unprofitable, because of a
lapk of railway facilities, and for this condition Oregon
blames Harriman. But who is to blame is of less importance
than the result. Oregon has resolved to relieve the difficulty
by, building railroads of its own, which is an experiment that
will be watched with interest. The amendment which is to
make the state railroads possible will' provide that they ;can^
not be sold, but may. be leased to private corporations, for
operating purposes, if it is deemed Sest. '"But 1 shch lease
must bring rental sufficient to provide for' all ''maintenance
and a sinking fund sufficient to cancel all debts'/ '•-'-• r; "- i- '
For several years Oregon has been soniething of a political
experiment, station, for^ the country. 1 It waslthe first state; to
try, the. initiative and referendum ; ; it ■ makes -: the'- nearest
cppstitutipiial approach to electing senators,- and incidentally
has, regulated the length of hatpins and other deadly weapons.
It, is fittiugj therefore, that Oregon should : be the. state I\i6 ex-^
periment ot? state ownership of railroads: surely, it is better
than for the nation to undertake the scheme; • But \ Oregon
mil not be the actual pioneer in -state ownership in this
country. : Years ago Missouri was in the .railroad business,
and didn't- -do 1 very well, i Oregon will .have to "show"
Missouri, as well as the other states.-r-Atchison Globe. ... g

The Taft administration" was initiated 1 yesterday at Was^*
fngton on more elaborate ceremonies* (nat the swearing. in- ? j6f
the president has ever before been conducted in the history
of the nation. -Tatf^is now -president,, and everything in
dicates a successful regime- equal.-, to the- splendid adminis
tration of Roosevelt and doubtless with less , friction, 'y^'-v ?■■
V There is wisdom m tlie call of President ; Roosevelt : for a
eonseryatiou convention, "representing the' 'nations of- the
-world. In several of the European countries', particularly
France, Germany and Switzerland, conservation of natural
resources is down to a scientific basis. These: nations only
•stand to gain by such a convention to the extent that all the
world has many things in common; a famine or a flood in
one country may be felt indirectly in another. But America,'
a newer . country, and more profligate in wasting its re
sources, has much to leaini If the nations with more ex
perience and wisdom in this particular can be induced to
enter, America may learn a few things for which it will owe
lasting gratitude, to President Roosevelt. Already Roose
velt has been the largest figure working toward con
servation in. the, western world, and his call for a world con
-ference on the subject is a crowning, creditable effort in that
direction.— Atchison Globe. ; - \
The Doctor's First Question
"How are your bowels?" This is generally the first ques-
tion the doctor asks. He knows what a sluggish liver
means. He knows what a long list of distressing com-
plaints result from constipation. He knows that headaches,
bilious attacks, indigestion, impure blood, and general
debility are often promptly relieved by a good liver pill.
We wish you would talk with your own doctor about
' this subject. Ask him at the same time if he approves
of Ayer's Pills. Do as he says. j.c.AyerCo.,Lowell.Af^.

BASKET BALL.
Jack*on Grammar Boys Win Prom
lone High School.
An interteslng gama of basket ball
was played last Bunday on the Jack*
son school grounds between the boys
of tbe Jaokson grammar school nnd a
team from the Union high school of
lone. Tbe military band enlivened
the proceedings by selections during
the progress of the contest, and a
goodly number of spectators gathered
to , witness tbe game. Krnnk Cuneo
of the borne team played a tact
game, and is entitled to muoh credit;
Tbe honor of victory, however, is
mainly due to Lesslle Love, who
leeing the Jackson boys were getting
the losing end in tbe eaily part of
the niatob, jumped In and plucked
victory from the verge of defeat, scor
ing enough points to deoide the event
In favor of county snnt team. Die
