PINEAPPLES.
The Jnice or This I'ralt Is a Great
Aid to Digestion.
The word enzyme does not appear to
have any connection with pineapple,
yet it is the uame of the chemical that
give.-; to the luscious fruit the remark
ably digestible property whicb it pos
sesses. The prevailing notion that pine
apple juire is excellent for the diges
tion is supported by medical testimony.
Eat v slice of the fruit after dinner,
say tbe doctors, and you will not suffer
from dyspepsia.
If you want to see what pineapple
can accomplish in the way of diges
tion, you can easily tost it 011 a piece of
raw steak. The action of pineapple
juice ou meat Is to transform it into
jelly and then dissolve it when in the
human st-jmuc}!.
Place a slice of the fruit ou the raw
meat as it li*s on a plate, and the up
per surface of the steak where the
fruit touches it will soon become gelat
inous. Enzyme, the active principle of
the juke, can be obtained by throwing
salt into the juice, thus producing a
precipitate.
A good sized pineapple contains two
pints of Juice, a fact that gives an idea
of what a slice of the fruit will do for
digestion. If cooked, the pineapple
loses its virtue in this respect. It may
ho asked whether the consumption of
the somewhat woody fruit itself is ben
eficial or not, for that can scarcely be
easily digestible.
Without doubt it is the juice which
does the good, not the flesh of the pine
apple, but the property of the juice Is
so effective that the eating of the fruit
itself can do no harm aud may even be
beneficial, Inasmuch as it takes some
of the strength of the juice to dissolve
it and so prevents the stomach suffer
ing from the too violent effects of the
juice.
THE SEISMOGRAPH.
liim the Earthquake Indicator Re-
cords tin- shucks.
In Its simplest form aa earthquake
indicator might be a tray with notched
edures so fHled with mercury that a
shaking of the earth would cause an
overflow in the direction of the move
ment. In the instrument used by sci
ence the pendulum Is employed, verti
cal by some Italians, horizontal by the
Japanese, English, most European and
American observers. A movement of
the earth affects everything but the
pendulum, which is so freely hung as
to remain stationary, and a recording
device makes the result visible. Of old
with the vertical pendulum a sharp
point drew the profile of the move
ments on a blackened surface. Photo
graphic paper in moving strips serves
the modern instruments.
The horizontal pendulum turns on a
vertical axis and carries at its extrem
ity a heavy weight which earth shock
does not reach. In the Milne seismo
graph a platinum sheet attached to this
weight has a slit intersecting at right
angles a slit in a second sheet under
neath. In times of quiet reflected light
passing through both slits makes one
point nnd prints a straight line on the
moving bromide paper. When the
earth shakes tho lower slit moves aud
the line becomes crooked, according to
the strength of the shock. A clockwork
arrangement with shutters anil n light
times the disturbance.
The instruments are so delicate as
sometimes to indicate shocks which no
men have felt.— New York World.
A Abraham Lincoln's Substitute.
During the earlier days of the war It
seems to have been the desire of all
prominent men in Washington to have
a representative in the ranks, and Lin
coln was no exception to the rule. At
that time there was a minister named
Staples In Washington, one of whose
sons, then aged nineteen, had a desire
to go to the front. Lincoln heard of
him and, after a conference, selected
him as his representative, and he prov
ed worthy, for he won honor ou tho
field. He survived the war and finally
died Hi Bttoudflbnrg, Pa. The inscrip
tion on the stone over his grave reads
as follows: "J. Suminerfleld Staples,
a private of Company C, One Hundred
and Seventy-sixth regiment, P. V.; also
a member of the Second regiment, D.
C. volunteers, as substitute of Abra
ham Lincoln."

ANTIQUITY OF BEER.
This Beverage Waa First Brewed by
the Egyptians.
Beer is of great antiquity. It was
manufactured first by the Egyptians
and afterward by the Greeks, Romans
and ancient Gauls. Beer was mention
ed by the following ancient writers:
Tacitus, Pliny, Xenophon and others.
The Romans are supposed to have in
troduced the brewing of beer or ale, as
It was then called, to the Britons, at
the time of the latter's conquest by the
former. The Britons continued the
brewing of barley malt, calling it ale,
until about 1524, when the Germans
introduced the brewing of hops with
the barley malt, calling it bier or, in
English, beer.
The history of the New England colo
nies shows that the Puritans were
great beer drinkers and that for a long
time every innkeeper made his own
beer. In those years beer was the gen
eral and popular drink. In the colony
of Massachusetts its retail price was
fixed by law at a penny a quart. Its
sale t(J Indians was not forbidden. A
law of 1640 ordered that every vict
ualer or ordinary innkeeper should al
ways be provided with good whole
some beer for the entertainment of
strangers.
The laws of the colony always favor
ed the manufacture of beer, and even
as late as ten years after Massachu
setts had become a state a law was
passed entitled, "An act to encourage
the manufacture and consumption of
beer, ale and other malt liquors."
The act freed beer from all taxation,
but it came too late after a series of
fiscal laws which for revenue purposes
had made beer dear and led to the im
portation of cheap rum from Jamaica.

CUTTLE BONE AND SEPIA.
Where They Come From and What
They- Are Used For.
Cuttle bone was once made use of as
a medicine, but it is now used by gold
smiths as a polish and by bird fanciers
as food for caged birds.
This cuttle bone, so called, is no bone
at all, but a very wonderful structure
consisting almost entirely of pure chalk
and having been at one time loosely
imbedded in tbe substance of some de
parted cuttlefish. It is an oval bone,
white and hard on the outside, but soft
and friable within, and is inclosed by
a membranous sack within the body of
the cuttle.
When the cuttle is living this struc
ture runs through the entire length of
the abdomen and occupies about one
third of its breadth. In weight cuttle
bone is extremely light, and if It be
cut across aud examined through a
lens the cause of the lightness will at
once be apparent It Is not solid, but
is formed of a succession of exceed
ingly thin floors of chalk, each con
nected with each by hundreds of the
smallest Imaginable chalky pillars.
Many persons attribute sepia, or Chi
nese ink, to the cuttlefish. They are,
however, in error, for sepia Is a manu
facture of soot and fine gums. The er
ror may be due to the fact that the
cuttlefish has an Internal sac under the
throat, near the liver, that contains a
very dark natural ink. When pursued
by enemies the cuttle ejects this inky
substance and thereby forms a cloud
of darkened water all about it and
hides in this water until out of danger.
Snow and Hall of Queer Colors.
Storms in which red, yellow and or
ange colored snows fell were recorded
as long ago as the sixth century. Huin
boldt mentions a hailstorm which onco
occurred iv Palermo In which every
hailstone was as red as a globule of
frozen blood. On March 14, ISI3, there
was a hailstorm iv Tuscany in which
the individual stones were each of a
bright yellow color. Iv 1808 at Carnio
la, Germany, they had a fall of crim
son snow which was nearly five feet
in depth. Suow of a brick red hue fell
In Italy in 1810 and in the Tyrol In
1847. In some sections of Iceland
snow seldom fails to any considerable
depth without being composed of nl
ternate layers of frozen crystals ot
different colors. There are arctic banks
of red snow which are so well known
to explorers that they are called the
"crimson cliffs."
Bird Preferences In Food.
Experiments have shown that birds
avoid the bright colored caterpillars, as
a rule. And this geerns almost to have
become a second nature, for a jack
daw, which had been raised in captiv
ity and had had no experience in Judg
ing the edible qualities of caterpillars,
was observed to regard the brilliant
caterpillar of the figure of eight moth
with suspicion and aversion, although
It eagerly devoured dull, plain cater
pillars placed within its reach. When
it was driven by hunger to attack the
other It finally refused to eat it, giv
ing plain evidences that there was
something distasteful about the prey.
Book Learning.
Book learning is the curse of our
whole educational system. The average
mechanic is far better educated in the
real sense of the term not only ,than
the average clerk, but than the average
clerk's average employer, and I should
say most gardeners have moro real
knowledge than most schoolmasters.—

SAN FRANCiSCO LETTER.
San Francicso, August 30:— The
month of August faas shown most
remarkable progress iv the way of re
building in San Francisco, and a
synopsis of the Bulletin of Progress,
issued by the California Promotion
Committee, presents a series of facts
that speak volumes for the manner in
wbicb the people of this city are tak
ing hold of reconstruction and busi
ness matters.
Information received from the
transcontinental railroads indicates
that travel westward continues far
above normal. The cheap colonist
rate which went into elfect August
27, is being generally taken advantage
of and reports from all parts ot the
country show that thousands of people
are preparing to come to California.
There is still an enormous demand
for labor in the skilled building
trades and ordinary labor in Ban
Francisco, while from all parts of the
state there is a call for tarm laborers.
It is estimated that there are now at
wArfc on reconstruction iv Smi Fran
cisco thirty thousand men, and many
more could be used.
August broke the record for value
of customs duties of tho port of San
Francisco, the estimate being 81,500,
000 tor the month, with .Monday the
27th as the banner day, when a
quarter ot a million dollars was
collected in customs. The tonnage
of the port was also very large, being
157,370 tons for the month.
Une thousand one hundred and
seventy-six building permits were
issued during the month, at a total
value of 5G,3:33,3G:{. Building con
tracts were recorded to the number
of 170, at a total value of 11,439,114.
'ihe number ot permanent buildings
begun increased from sixty-six at the
end of July to 711, an increase ot 015
during the month.
The bank clearings of San Francisco
during August amounted to the
enormous total of 8180,844,594.73,
against 8155,841, 918.86 for the same
month of 1905, an iucrease of 1G per
cent for the month.
Reports from Santa Rosa, where
much damage was done April IS,
shows that the city is rapidly being
rebuilt. All ot the debris was
cleared away within six weeks of the
tire, and now buildiilgs are under
way all along the main street. Re
ports from Los Ange'es aud San J)iego
show that unusual prosperity marks
the business of both the large south
ern cities. The interior of the state
also makes good reports regarding
prosperity in all lines of business.
Caretul estimates now place the
population of San Francisco at. 370,
000. Many residence buildings are
under construction, and as fast as
they are completed they are oc
cupied. It is estimated tht>t tho
coming month will show a wonder
ful increase in this particular, as
many houses begun two and three
months ago will be completed withiu
that time and will be immediately
ocoupied. The supply ot building
material is adequate to demand.
Lumber is coming in rapidly aud all
other lines are ivell stocked up.
Orders for all sorts of material are
being tilled readily, and contractors
are finding no trouble iv this parti
cular.
In the matter of debris removal
there has been little change. It is
estimated that with the railroads and
private disposal of debris fully 125
carloads are being disposed of each
day. Much of this is being used in
the city to till low lying iots, aud
along the water front to till in marshy
ground.
business in all lines of retail trade
continues to hold a high mark. The
merchants all report continued in
crease of trade. Wholesale and shipp
ing interests also show increase.
In the matter of increased cost ot
living it is estimated that the iu
crease iv rent of residence property
is about ten per cent, while that of
property now being utilized for busi
ness purposes temporarily has been
largely increased to rnret competitive
demand. In table supplies the
increase ia estimated at about 11.,I 1 ., per
cent over prices obtaining before tho
fire.
Democratic
Convention
The Proceedings in Full.
The democratic county convention
met iv Jackson, in the superior court
room on Saturday last. There was
a fair attendance. Drytown was the
only preciuet that was not represent
ed. About 17 delegates were repre
sented by proxy, making the actual
number of persons present about 67.
This is fully up to the average attend
ance at nominating conventions, it
was one of the chilliest gatherings of
the uuterritied that Amador has wit
nessed for many years; more like a
convocation of dispirited partisans
under tho shadow ot impending de
feat, than the exultant anthem of
coufideuce iv victory. There was not
a contest to enliven the proceedings,
except on the uuimportaut office of
coroner and public administrator,
and that was decided with one ballot.
The promised contest for the record
ership did not materialize, Caminetti
withdrawing at the eleventh hour.
The convention was called to order
at halt-past 11 by T. M. Ryan, chair
man of the couuty central committee.
Jamet Meehan was elected temporaiy
chairman, as a compliment to his
antique democracy, and was greeted
with rounds of applause on taking
his seat.
L. J. Glavinovich was elected secre
tary.
The following committees were ap

Resolutions aud Platform.
The committee ou platform and
resolutions reported tho following:
We tho representatives of the de
mocracy of Amador county in conven
tion assembled, reaffirm onr faith in
the doctrines of the democratic party,
and the principles for which it stands
as euuuoiated by tho illustrious
'Thomas Jelfeison. We pledge our un
dying support to tho principles un
derlying tho constitution of the
United States aud the declaration of
iudepeudeneo.
We appiove the conduct of the pres
eut democratic officials during their
iucutr.bency of office, and point with
piide to I lie fact that under their ad
ministration their respective duties
have been faithfully, honestly and
economically performed.
We nlo U;u all our nominees for
couuty and township offioes to a strict
adheteuue to duty aud a faithful and
economical niimiustratiou of the
attairs of their respective offices.
Wo pledge onr candidate for asses
sor, if elected, to keep the assessor's
office at tbe court house open for the
aeoommodution of the taxpayers dur
ing offioo hours all the year round, as
-^ The children's friend —

tbe law contemplates, and aa tbe tax
payers have tbe rigbt to expect.
We deplore the fact that each county
in the state is deprived by tbe exist
ing law from having a representative
of its own in oar state legislature,
unhampered and uuembarassed by tbe
conflicting interests of otber counties,
and we urge our representatives to
use their best endeavors to rectify
this evil.
We pledge our earnest support to tbe
candidates that may be nominated by
tbe congressional, senatorial and as
sembly districts of wbioh tbia county
forms a part, and to tbe nominees of
the party generally to be named at
tbe coming state convention.
Tbe committee on order of business
and organization reported recom
mending that the temporary officers
be made permanent, and tbe usual
oader of business.
All tbe reports of committees were
adopted as read.
Judge R. C. Rust moved that each
candidate placed before tbe conven
tion be required to deposit witb tbe
secretary the sum of 85 for tbe good
ot tbe cause. ' W. L. Rose wanted to
make it 310 on county officers and $5
ou township candidates. There was
so much opposition to this plan that
tbe amendment was withdrawn, and
the $5 call was adopted.
Nominations.
Nomination for sheriff and tax
collector was first on tbe list. J. W.
Surface of lone nominated (J. S.Greg
ory in a brief speech. It [was un
necessary to eulogize bim. He had
been sheriff for ten years. No'sheriff
in this county bad ever landed so
many criminals behind prison walls
as he. He ranked witb Hume, Cun
ningham, Ben Thorn and otber noted
sheriffs of tbe state.
D. B. Spagnoli seconded the nomin
ation aud predicted that he would be
tbe next sheriff. There was no otber
candidate, and be was declared tbe
unanimous choice ot the convention.
The nominee, after planking down
tbe required gold piece, made a
speech. He said this made tbe fourth
time he bad been nominated tor
sheriff— three time unanimously. He
was proud of tbe honor thus bestowed
upon him, and whether elected or de
feated he would give them no cause
for regret. He would do his best to
win. He called upon all present to
help him, and it tbeydid so be would
be tbe next sheriff.
Some delegate from the body of tbe
room shouted, "You won't have to
sell peanuts after election."
Gregory had finished tbe remarks
he wanted to make, but this voice
from tbe unknown caused him to
launch forth again witb considerable
feeling. He did not know whether
ttie remark was intended sa a compli
ment or a slur. He did sell peanuts,
and was not ashamed of it, or any
other kind of bonest labor. This little
incident was tbe only source of
amusement for tbe day.
Clerk and Auditor. —John Lithgow
nominated John R. Huberty, who waa
chosen unanimously.
Assessor.— C. E. Fournier placed C.
E. Jarvis of Sutter Creek in nomina
tion, and without opposition he was
accorded the honor of making the
race.
County Recorder.— Judge Rust said
:his office required care and attention
and when a good officer is found, it
is well to keep him. He nominated
the present incumbent, L). A. Patter
son. Sickness bad crippled bis bands
and made useless his feet, but bis in
tellect was as clear as evei.
W. L. Rose plaoed A. B. Caminetti
of Jackson in nomination and Dr. En
dicott seconded.
A. B. Caminetti here addressed the
convention, and said that in tbe in
terest of harmony and good feeling he
withdrew from the contest, and Pat
terson was selected nnanimously.
Treasurer.— W. L. Rose named Geo.
A. Gritton for this office, and be was
chosen without contest for a second
term.
Superintendent of Schools. — Dr.
Endicott named tbe present incum
bent, Geo. A. Gordon, and said the
record he bad made was nis eulogy,
lie was declared tbe nominee.
District Attorney.— A. Caminetti,
in nominating tbe present incumbent,
C. P. Vicini, said his record in the
office would excel that ot any of his
predecessors. He had made one of
the best district attorneys the county
had ever had. It went through slick
as tbe rest.
Coroner and Public Administrator.
— W. L. Rose presented the name of
John Daneri of Sutter Creek for this
position, and said be would make a
winner, and would carry tbe republi
can stronghold ot Sutter Creek.
R. C. Rust placed in nomination T.
M. Ryan ot Marlell station.
A ballot was taken, resulting in
Kyan receiving 50 votes, Daneri 33.
Kyan was declared the cboioe of the
convention.
Surveyor.— W. Brown of Oleta, the
present incumbent, was tbe nominee
for this office, and tbe $5 penalty was
remitted.
This completed tbe list of county
berths to be disposed of, subject to
tbe will of tbe voters in November.
Judge Kust introduced the following
resolution :
Five Cents Per Copy.
Whereas, there exists a* condition in
this senatorial district, and through
out the state of California, that calls
for men of experience, ability and
honesty in the legislature of this
state.
And, whereas, we recognize in the
Hon. A. Caminetti these qualities in
an eminent degree, evidenced in the
past in the legislatures of California
and tbe halls of congress.
Therefore, be it resolved, that this
convention earnestly requests him to
allow his name to be presented to
the legislative convention lor the
nomination of senator ot this dis
trict.
And be it further resolved, that the
delegates elected to represent the de
moraoy of Amador county in the state
convention advocate his nomination
for senator.
A discussion arose. Caminetti ob
jected to the resolution, and urged
its withdrawal. In deference to bis
objections, the last clause was
stricken out, and in this abbreviated
shape it went through wi:h a whoop.
The convention next separated into
their respective township conventions
for the purpose of nominating town
ship officers, and to decide upon their
representatives to state convention
and on the county central committee.
Upon the reassembling, the business
was wound up as follows:
Delegates to state convention.— At
large, A. Caminetti; township 1, R. U.
Rust; township 2, Thomas Scully; 3,
T. C. Stowers; township 4— A. Riley;
township 5, L. Clark.
County Central Committee.—Town
ship 1 L. J. Uiavinovich, E.W.Kelly;
2, Arthur Clifton, A. Davis; 3. W. T.

W. Walsh; 5, Alex Orr, D. Bnrke.
At large, M. Newman.
Auditing Committee.— l, W.L. Fort

4, M. D. Nixon; 5, Robert White.
Committee under purity of election
law— l, B. F. Gilbert. A Massa, John
Scully. \V. M. Penry jr., A. Riley.
The country central committee was
empowered to fill all vacancies in the
county and township tickets.
Nominations for township officers
were reported as follows :
Township I.— Justice of the peace,
Alfred Goldner; constable, A. Lav
erone.
Township 2.— Justice, T.H. Gartlin;
constable, J. K. Kelly.
Township 3.- -Supervisor, A. B. Mc-
Langbhn; Justice, M. Robiceon; con
stable, James LeasJey.
Township 4. —Justice, W. L. Rose;
constable, no nomination.
Township 5.- -Supervisor, Lawrence
Burke; justice, blanu; constable, N.
E. Wheeler.
The convention adjourned with three
cheers tor the chairman, which by an
afterthought was made to do service
tor the ticket as well.

THE DEMOCfiATIC PLATFOEM.
The democratic local plattorm, adop
ted at the convention held last Satur
day, appears in another column. We
ask our readers — whether democrats
or republicans— to read it carefully.
If they can make out anything out
of it, it is more than we can. It is
the nearest approach to saying noth
ing that we have stumbled across in a
proclamation of that character in
many moons. It was significant that
not one ot the candidates nominated
stated that he endorsed the platform.
Probably they were in the same dilem
ma as the spectators— they did not
know what it meant. They did not
care to plant themselves on a lot of
hot air. We cannot call it a tissue of
glittering generalities, for there is
no glitter about it. It professes to
pledge all its nomiuees to an econom
ical administration of affairs, and at
the same time endorses and com
mends present democratic officials in
their conduct. This verbiage, there
fore, if it means anything, merely
seeks to perpetuate existing condi
tions, as far as they are concerned.
They are the ne plus ultra of
efficiency. This sort of tatty will
hardly go with the voters. It can
and will be shown that we are a long
way from the goal in this regard.
Then again the fling about the assess
or having his office at the county
seat open ail the year round during
office hours, insidiously adding, "as
the law contemplates." Where does
' the law, either in express terms or
by implication, require the assessor
to do this. Did the trainers of this
ultra partisan platform imagine they
could make a point in favor of their
candidate, and against the present
republican assessor by such a plank
misleading and untrue. The county
government act cays:
"The following officers must reside
at the county seat of their respective
counties: County clerk, auditor,
recorder, sherilt, district attorney,
tax-collector, and treasurer All
county officers must have their offices
at the county seat, and the sheriff,
clerk, recorder, auditor, treasurer
and district attorney must keep their
offices open for the transaction jot
business from 9 a. m. until £ p. m.
uon judical days excepted."
The assessor being omitted from
this list, the only inference to be
drawn is flatly contradictory ot the
democratic platform, namely that the
law does not "contemplate" that the
assessors shall have his office open
during office hours at the county seat
all the year round. There is nothing
to be gaiuad by misrepresentation,
even in a democratic platform, which
according to tradition is generally
meant to hoodwink the voters.
There is nothing to be gained by the
assessor having his office open as the
plattorm wants. It would increase
the cost of government without any
corresponding benefit. From August
to March the assessor has practically
nothing to do with taxpayers. His
books are turned over to other
officials. Perhaps the democrats are
figuring to fasten another berth on
an already over burdened community,
in the shape of a deputy assessor "all
the year round." It is a move in the
direction of extravagance and sine
cure officers, rather than of economy
and the public welfare.
Then again the proposition of each
county being allowed a representative
of its own in the state legislature, is
another utterly piacticable idea.
It would sweep away the time honored
and coirect method of representation
according to population. Ainador
has suffered, inasmuch as she has
not been dealt with fairly according
to population in the present legisla
tive apportionment. Still we must
admit that we are not entitled to an
assemblyman alone. Wo must grow
some, aud keep paco with other
6ectiou=.

Gillett for Governor.
Congressmen J. N. Gillett vyas
nominated at the Sauta Cruz republi
can convention yesterday for gover
nor. The desperate tactics of the
machine, under tho control ot W. F.
Heiriug, the Southern Pacific rail
road attorney, in trading everything
and anything for votes for the head
of the ticket, succeeded in landing
Gillett a winner on the first ballot.
It was realized that the trick had to
be done at the initial vote, or it
would remain undone. It was evi
dent to the delegates that Pardee was
the choice ot the masses of the party,
but this fact cut no ice in the ruth
less methods of the machine, what
ever figure it may cut with the voters
on election day. Gulett has made a*
good congressman; no doubt he
would make an equally good gover
nor. But we do not believe, under
the circumstanes surrounding his
nomination that he will make as
strong a candidate. The republican
majority in the state, however, is
depended upon to bring him out a
winner at the polls. Probably it will
do so, as the democratic party is
split into warring factions.
Changei From a Fiah to a Bird.
The story of the early life, transfor
mation and final death of the Chinese
quail is the in-.vt remarkable that !•
found in the ornithological literature of
the world. The narrative in all its un
reasonableness Is found in the story of
om chung, which Is the name the Chi
nese quail is known by when at home
in the Flowery Kingdom. Celestial au
thorities on bird lore declare that no
specimen of om chung was ever known
to live a year; that they do not lay
eggs, as all other known species of
birds do, and, finally, that their pro
genitor ia a slimy, four jointed worm,
which has a red head and a sting on
the end of Its tail. This queer seacoast
worm, according to the curious legend
of om chuug, lays 100 eggs annually.
Fifty of these become fish and the oth
er fifty are worms of the same species
as the parent. The fish that has come
into existence in this curious manner
also lays 100 eggs a year. Fifty of
these become water denizens after the
Image of their parent, and the others
become birds of the famed om chung
family. These om chungs, or Chinese
quails, never breed, and are only
brought into existence as above related.
We give the above not as a literal fact,
but as a specimen of the Chinese Idea
of evolution.
Bulldoga v Menace to Health.
The bulldog is a menace to health.
We have this on the uuthority of a
noted French physician, who says that
because of his large mouth the bull
dog Is a great purveyor of disease, es
pecially of consumption, diphtheria
and the like, as the dribbling from the
heavy, loose jaws is incessant. Those
who fondle bulldogs do so at a great
risk. He traces many cases of In
fectious disease, especially among
young children, to households In which
bulldogs are kept as pets. When we
add to this the invariable ferocity of
the beast, the danger to which children
and other luuocent and defenseless
people are exposed whenever he roams
the streets or highways, we have an
argument in favor of his disposal that
cannot be gainsaid. Away with bull
dogs!

Get some spermaceti, roll a wad large
enough to fill the ear orifices, put It in
a piece of fine cotton cloth tiefl with
thread and insert into ears on retiring,
pressing it quite firmly therein so that
the ball of spermaceti will closely fill
up all the air space in the ears. You
will find it quite effective for barring

Face Burned
K. S. Chase, the proprietor of the
cyanide tailings plant at the Key
stone mine, met with a painful
accident last Saturday. He was at
his work attending to the plant. Iv
some unexplained manner, the gaso
lene cau iguited, and his fellow
worker took up the burning can with
the intention of throwing it outside.
Chase was attracted naturally to the
point of danger to do what he could
in the mergeucy. In swinging the
can around tho flame struck Chase
squarely in the tace. it was only for
an instant, but it was long enough to
do considerable mischief. His face
was blistered, and he was burned
about one ear. He was over in Jack
son Monday at the celebration, with
his face all bandaged, except the eyes,
the sight of which fortunately was
not injured. The scorching was not
long enough to involve more than
the skin. The skin of the face will
all peel olf, still be thinks himself
very fortunate to get off without per
manent injury.

On J^otion of District Attorney the
Case is Dismissed.
The case of People vs F. M. Staples
was brought to a close yesterday
afternoon, by the dismissal of the
proceedings, and release of the de
fendant. The defendant's counsel,
A. Cauiiuetti, was present, but took
uo part in the finale, other than as
an onlooker. There was no occasion
for any effort on his part, as the dis
trict attorney assumed all the re
sponsibility of the matter, and made
the motion for the prisoner's dis
charge. The district attorney stated,
that the defendant had been found
guilty of murder in the first degree
for the killing of his wife, Edna May
Staples, on August 31, 1904, without
recommendation. On appeal to the
supreme court, the verdict was re
cently set aside, and a new trial
ordered. This decision was based
almost entirely on the insufficiency
of the evidence to warrant the ver
dict. He had made inquiries since,
and found it impossible to present
any more evidence than was pro
duced at the foimer trial; in fact,
the prosecution would not be able to
present as strong a case as it did
then. The decision of the higher
couit meant that the prosecution
must either present more evidence or
dismiss the case. It was beyond his
power to get additional evidence, and
therefore he felt it his duty to move
that the case b» dismissed aud de
fendant discharged.
The court remarked that the ver
dict bad been set aside solely on the
ground of insuffioent evidence, and
uot on tne rulings of the court. All
the court rulings had been sustained,
except one, and that did not change
the view of the court. If reversal
of the judgment had been on the
rulings, the court would have been
inclined to deny the motion to dis
miss, as the errors might bo avoided
in another trial. ' Bnt as it was the
motion was granted, and the defend
ant ordered discharged from custody.
Thereupon F. N. Staples left the
court room a free man. There was
no one present in the court room
while these proceedings were had,
except the officers of the court and a
representative of the Ledger.
F. N. Staples has been in jail
eighteen months. He is looking
well; and does not seem to have lost
flesh ur suffered mentally by his
long imprisonment.

home in this city.
A DIABOLICAL ACT.
A Powder Trap Laid in Kennedy
Mine.
Reports are current on the street of
one of the most dastardly outrages
that we have been called upon to
chronicle. It was at the Kennedy
mine. Fortunately, the plot mis
carried, as it was revealed in a way
that did not involve injury to life or
limb. There is ilttle doubt, how-
ever, that it was a scheme to kill.
Ihia is how the story is reported to
us.
Sunday and Monday uuderground
operations were suspended to enable
the company to do the necessary
work to adjust the safety clutches to
the skips. On Saturday night one ot
the drill men known as Liberatto, an
Italian— his correct name we believe
is DeVecchio— and his partner left a
hole half drilled. This was at the
2700 level. It is no uncommon thing
to leave a hole over night iv this
shape. The finishing of the hole was
left for Tuesday. There were there
fore over two days that the half drill
ed hole was left. On going to work
Tuesday, and continuing the drilling,
a giant powder cap was reached after
drilling a very short distance.
The cap was exploded but did no
damage. Of course the fact of find
ing a cap in this manner awakened a
suspicion of foul play. An in
vestigation was made, revealing a
deliberate and malicious, plot to kill.
In the interval of suspension ot work,
some one had drilled a hole with the
machine in a diagonal course, so that
when the regular drillers completed
the half bored hole it would strike
this unsuspected hole. This hole had
been charged with eight or nine caps
and two sticks of giant powder.
There was no fuse, and the opening
of the drilled holo was carefully
plugged up with dirt, so as to conceal
it. By a miracle one of the caps went
off without firing the rest or explod
ing the powder. Had the charge ex
ploded it would have blown them to
pieces.
It is said that DeVecchio refused
to walk out in the strike that was
inaugurated a iuouth ago by the red
flag organization. The supposition is
that this outrage was the outgrowth
of that affair.
The machine must have been shitted
to bore this trap hole. The drill
left in the hole by the regular work
ers had been takea out, and a shorter
one— the one that had bored the con
cealed hole— had been left in its
place. The machine had been moved
back to its former place, so as not to
awaken suspicion. The workers were
not aware of the substitution of drills
until the whole plot had been un
covered. It is supposed that the
work was done between Saturday
evening and Sunday morning.
A Destructive Fire.
In the height of the labor day cele
bration a heavy column of smoke was
observed just south of town, and
many were anxious to ascertain its
whereabouts, it proved to be on the
ranch of Geo. L. Thomas,— the old
Clark place, a mile from town. The
barns, hay, slaughter-house {-for the
butchering business were all located
there. The fire broke out about 1
o'clock in the afternoon. D. Gian
nini was the first to the scene, and
succeeded in liberating three or tour
horses belonging to Thomas, which
were inclosed in the corral. But for
precaution the animals would surely
have perished. No one knows how or
in what building the fire started.
The only person on the place at the
time, were Lawrence Sauguinetti
and wife, who reside iv the dwelling
house, and have charge ot the place.
The fire destroyed the large bam and
shed adjaecnt, with about 40 tons of
hay. Also a cabin in which was
stored some five tons of grain, also
the wa^on shed, in which was the
delivery wagon worth S2OO, and a
cart, with a quantity of harness. In
the corral was a stack of hay, which
also went up in the smoke. The
total loss will toot up between 81500
and §2000. There was a very small
insurance about §250 ou the baru. A
number went from Jacksou aud by
back firing raauaged to keep the
flames from spreading through the
dry grass.
Gone to Conference.
Key. C. E. Winning has just con
cluded the second year of his pastor
ate in Jackson, as pastor of the
Methodist church. He on Wednesday
morning started for Pacific Grove,
the seat of the annual coufereuce,
where he will report to his Bishop,
and receive his appuiutmeut for the
coming year. He does not know
whether he will be returned to Jack
son or not, though the very kiudiiest
relation exists between the dominie
and his floek — the latter having urged
his re-appointment. Since coming to
Jackson, Rev. Winning has married
thirty-four couples, baptized lorty
five children and twelve adults,
officiated at ninety-sevou funerals,
made upwards of one thousand five
hundred pastoral oails, preached over
two hundred and fifty sermons and
otherwise "kept busy," and he goes
to conference with the seeming good
will of all our community.

LABOR DAY CELEBRATION,
/ A Good Turnout and Successful
Affair all Round.
f The celebration of labor day was
3 held in Jackson this year. Hereto
> fore it has taken the form of a picnic
at Fullen's Grove, midday between
■ Jackson and Sutter Creek. This
' year, having received substantial
encouragement in the shape of liberal
■ donations from the business men of
Jackson, it was decided to have the
1 celebration in the town, under the
auspices ot Jackson Miners' Union
W. F. M. There was little done in
1 the way of decorating, those having
charge of the affair thought it better
1 to spend the money in ottering a
number ot substantial prizes in the
amusement program, which they
believed would give satisfaction to all
concerned. And the public was with
them in this decision. The grand
stand was erected in front of the
bauk, the tug of war platform in
tront ot the Union hotel, and the
drilling contest platform near the
north Main street bridge, with the
riding tournament Uixngs on Water
street. This, distributed the attrac
tions as evenly as possible.
The day was all that could be
desired as to weather conditions, and
a large attendance was looked for.
But the crowd hardly came up to
anticipations. While the street was
lined with spectators during the
sporting events, they were nearly all
town people or from the immediate
vicinity. But few came from a dis
tance. Nevertheless there were
enough in Jackson and dependent
territory to make any event of the
kind a success in every way. A few
of the business places decorated
their premises, and Main street took
ou a decidedly holiday garb. There
was a total absence of the absurd
and costly firing of cannons, much
to the relief of the citizens. Other
celebration committees may well take
a pattern from this policy, and drop
the noise business. The procession
formed about ten o'clock consisting
of members of the Miners' Union
from Jackson and other points in the
county. There was little of the
pageant about it; simply a show of
cumbers, each member wearing the
badge of the Uuion. Tbere were
between 220 aud 230 in lino all told,
headed by the Jacksou band, a
carriage containing the officers of
the day winding up the procession.
Alter parading Main street and
Broadway under the marshalship of
James Madden they halted at the
graud staud, and the literary exercises
were gone through with. These were
brief.
William H. Daley as president of
tho day called the assembly to order,
aud made a brief speech of welcome.
The Roy. C. E. Winning, the chap
lain, ottered prayers, the baud gave
several selections, aud Chas. H.
Crocker, tho orator of the day made
an address. It was short aud to the
point and was well received by all.
Afternoon Program.
In the afternoon there was a notice
able increase in the number ot visit
ors. The street was crowded all the
time. There was not a hitch or
wait between the various events.
We givo the list of events aud prize
winners as follows:
Drilling contest, back iioie, hole to
rise 2 inches on a foot; first prize,
S100; 2nd prize, SSO. Four teams to
enter or no contest, entrance fee, 85;
eight-pound hammers or under, J 8
steel. No swedgebacks; for union
men in good standing only. First
prize won by Eugene Bonti and M.
Finnetti, who drilled IS 1 .; inches;
second prize won by Matt Thomas and
— Caruaggio, who made 16J^ inches.
The third prize fell to Peter Millo
vich and John Laverone.
Shoveling contest for union shovel
ers iv good standing; first prize, §10;
2ud prize, $5. Three to enter or no
contest. First prize, U. Giannini of
Kennedy mine.
Kace for union men in good standing
ouly; first prize, 57.50; 2nd prize,
33.50. Thomas Laugdon first; M.
Erbez, second prize.
Kace for men, free for all, first
prize, 87.50; 2nd prize 53.50. This
event elicited much interest. A pro
fessional athlete was entered, and it
was thought by some that he would
lower the colors of our local sprinter
Jack McCuteheu of the Shoe Store.
The outcome was that McCutcben
won easily. It was claimed that a
foul had beeu perpetrated by some
one running in front of the second
mau, but it was not allowed by the

TEACHERS' EXAMINATION.
List of Successful Applicants.
The board of education of Amador
county last Saturday finished one
of the most strenuous sessions held
for many years. These meetings for
the granting of teachers' certificates
are held annually, instead of semi
annually. As a result the number of
applicants is larger and the papers to
be examined are more numerous.
There were 39 applicants at the first
meeting. Some of these fell out
alter the first day, having failed on
the test studies. Twenty-nine passed
through the ordeal, however, and
secured certificates leaving only 10
that failed out of the class. Of the
successful ones only six are from
this county. The others were from
distant portions of the state, reaching
as far as San Francisco on the south
to Colusa on the north. Ine list of
successful applicants is as follows:
Miss Alice J Rice, Colusa; Miss
Beth Sillo, Arbuckle; Miss Verona

Evidenco is accumulating to show
that the chemical elements iv general
are not as fixed and unalterable as
was supposed a few years ago. In
Germany, 11. l''abiuyi has prepared
chlorine by adding sulphuric acid to
a mixture of potassium perchrouiate
and sodium chloride, and in another
experiment by adding sodium chloride
drop by drop to potassium per
chromate mixed with sulphuric acid.
The two specimens of chlorine
differed materially, although prepared
from the satno materials and neitbei
showed any impurity on being tested.
The second specimen was much
darker and more greenish than the
first, and iv aqueous solution it was
much more- rapidly tianstormed by
light into hydrochloric acid. The
experimenter thinks the chlorine atom
may vary iv structure as radioactive
bodies seem to do.
The aquatic plants ot a puud have
an important influence upon the Ushes
in the water. The investigations ot
K. H. Pearl, the American botanist,
prove that most rooted water plants
extract mineral food from the ground,
and such vegetation as the pondweed
(Potamogeton) aids fishes by adding
mineral substances to the water. On
the other hand, the hornwort (Cera
tophyllum) unfits a lake for fish life,
as it takes its own food from the salts
iv tae water.
French aeronautic authorities have
given the name "aeronef," or avia
tion apparatus, to a flying machine
that is heavier than the air. The
varieties include: (1) the helicopter,
sustained and driven by one or
several propellers; (2) the aeroplane,
chiefly sustained by one or more flat
or curved surfaces; and (3) the
orthopter, or mechanical bird, sus
tained and propelled by beating
wings.
One of the earth's plant wonders is
the huge plane tree, nearly eighteen
yards in circumference, of the island
of Cos, in the Aegean Sea. A breast
high platform around it seems to
have been built to support the hollow
and weakened trunk, and the well
preserved lower branches are held up
by pieces of antique columns over
whose tops the branches have grown
like caps. On the marble seat in the
shade of the tree Hippocrates, the
father of medicine, is supposed to
have taught the healing art four
centuries before Christ. The tree,
therefore, must be considerably more
than 2000 years old, and the Sultau
holds it in such veneration that it is
closely guarded day and night. With
steam-generated current is the greater
Industrial extravagance ot the age.
Dr. Feuerbacb, a European lamp
factory superintendent, cites tho
Cuban lire fly's phosphorescence,
which contains 09 per cent ot light
and only 1 per cent ot heat, and con
trasts this with the luminous etil
ciency ot the incandescent lamp,
which he finds to be only 1 per cent.
Another electrician shows that the
incandescent lamp consumes one
tenth horse-power for a light of 10
candles, which is ten times tha con
sumption of the electric arc for an

much difficulty, a liritish surgeon
lately secured a few twigs, leaves and
catkins as museum specimens.
The incandescent lamp fed by
equal effect. The energy ot coal
being 100 per cent, it is continued, a
first class engine recovers 13 per cent
the electric generator of 95 per cent
efficiency makes available 12.35 per
cent, and the incandescent lamp
utilizes 90 per cent of this, or 11.11
per cent of the whole. Xhe luminous
rays of the lamp being 1 per cent,
the light represents about one-tenth
of 1 per cent of the energy stored in
coal.
Caterpillars have been found to be
greatly agitated by musical vibra
tions, descending from a tree iv a
shower at the sound of a comet.
This should suggest an effective
means of fighting the gypsy moth and
other caterpillar plagues.
Curious bands of light and shadow
have been noted momentarily as the
sun rises and sets. For a special
study of toe phenomenon, C. Rozet,
•a French observer, has arranged a
white screen to receive the rays on
the rising of the sun from behind a
bill, and has fouud the bands very
distinct, usually straight but some
times undulating. They seem to be
parallel to the part of the sun's edge
that is just visible. They may be
seen for two or three seconds or
more after sunrise or betoie sunset,
are about an inch or an inch and a
half wide, and travel sideways at
greatly varying velocity— one to two
yards and six to nine yards per second
being the extremes. The velocity
seems to bear some relation to that
ot the wind.
A new b'rencb automatic alarm is
adjustable for small or large rises of
temperature, and may be used to give
warning of tire or to signal too much
heating of any substances, as coal,
fats, etc. It depends upon the ex
pansion of the air in a closed com
partment of a metallic vessel. The
increased pressure forces a diaphragm
upward, and this touches the adjust
ing screw, closing an electric circuit.
One bell-circuit may be made to
serve for several of these simple
pieces of apparatus, which may be
distributed in the danger spots of any
establishment.
A growing evil reported by Dr. Aba
Sztaukay among the Slovaks of Upper
Hungary is the habitual use of
camphor internally. For fourteen
years he has persistently questioned
buyers of the drug, and he concludes
that at least 25 per cent of the large
and increasing amount sold is used
by the camphor-eaters. An increase
in epilepsy seems to be a result of
this indulgence.
The London physician's discovery
that scars may be prevented or re
moved by cutting the skin slantwise
instead of vertically is pronounced
one of the most impoitant of recent
advances in surgery.
A bath cleanses the skin and rids
the pores of refuse. A bath makes
for better fellowship and citizenship.
-Not only should the outside of the
body be cleansed, but occasional use
of a laxative or cathartic opens the

ANATOMY OF AN OYSTER
The pivalre's Organ* and Where
They Are Located.
Every oyster Las a mouth, a heart, a
liver, a stomach and other necessary
Internal organs, including a set of cun
ningly devised intestines. The mouth
is at the small end of the oyster's body,
near the hinge of the shell. It is oval
in shape, and, though not readily dis
covered by an unpracticed eye, it may
be easily located by gently poshing n
blunt bodkin or similar instrument
along the folds of the surface of the
body at the place mentioned. Connect
ed with the mouth is the canal which
the oyster uses in conveying food to
the stomach, from whence it passes in
to the curious little set of netted and
twisted intestines referred to in the
opening.
To discover the heart of au oyster
the fold of flesh which oystermen call
the "mantle" must be removed. This
is fatal to the oyster, of course, but in
the interest of science and for the ben
efit of the "curious"' it is occasionally
done. When the mantle has been re
moved the heart, shaped like a crescent
or horned moon, is laid to -the view.
The oyster's heart is made up of two
parts, just like that of a human being,
one of which receives the blood from
the gills aud the other drives It out
through the arteries. The liver is
found In the immediate vicinity of the
heart and stomach and is a queer
shaped little organ, which is supposed
to perform all the functions of a blood
filter.
JAVA'S ISLAND OF FIRE.
It Is Really a Lake of Boiling, Bab-
bling; Mud and Slime.
The greatest natural wonder in Java,
if not in the entire world, Is the justly
celebrated "Gheko Kamdka Gumko,"
or "Home of the Hot Devils," known
to the world as the Island of Fire.
This geological singularity is really a
lake of boiling mud situated at about
the center of the plains of Grobogana
and Is called an island because the
great emerald sea of vegetation which
surrounds it gives it that appearance.
The "island" is about two miles in cir
cumference, and is situated at a dis
tance of almost exactly fifty miles
from Solo. Near the center of this
geological freak immense columns of
soft, hot mud may be seen continually
rising and falling like great timbers
thrust through the boiling substratum
by giant hands and the again quickly
withdrawn. Besides the phenomenon
of the boiling mud columns there are
scores of gigantic bubbles of hot slime
that fill up like huge balloons and keep
up a series of constant explosions, the
Intensity of the detonations varying
with the size of the bubble. In time
past, so the Javanese authorities say,
there was a tall splrelike column of
baked mud on the west edge of the
lake which constantly belched a pure
stream of cold water, but this has long
been obliterated, and everything is
now a seething mass of bubbling mud
and slime.
EYEGLASSES.
Hotv to Put Them on and Take Them
OS Properly.
There is nothing which more com
pletely changes the effect of a pair of
eyeglasses than the habit of crowding
them oil the nose witli one hand. The
best efforts at fitting and adjusting are
all brought to naught by a person who
has acquired that habit.
The proper way to take off glasses
is to take hold of the bridge and lift
off gently without dragging or pulling
out of shape. To take off spectacles
take hold of the right temple with the
right hand and lift It off the ear. Then
turn the head to the right and the left
temple will fall off easily.
Tho average wearer of glasses when
he is cleaning them takes hold of the
bridge. The consequence is that he
gradually works the bridge out of
shape, and every rub he gives the lens
gives a twist to the bridge, and in
course of time the bridge or the leng
breaks when he least expects it. There
are probably "more glasses broken in
this way than any other.
The correct way to clean them Is to
take hold of one of the eye pieces
where the glass Is screwed on the outer
edge and clean the lens, and then re
verse the glasses, take it by the other
end piece and repeat the process on
that lens.
She Didn't Sleep Well.
A woman who lives in an inland
town, while going to a. convention in a
distant city, spent one night of the
journey on board a steamboat. It was
the first time she had ever traveled by
water. She reached her journey's end
extremely fatigued. To a friend who
remarked it she replied:
"Yes, I'm tired to death. I don't
know that I care to travel by water
again." I read the card in my state
room about how to put the life pre
server on, and I thought I understood
it, but I guess I didn't. Somehow I
couldn't go to sleep with the thing on."

A Judge's Advice.
Recently a retired English judge tow
asked what was the most prominent
conviction that remained with him aft

is said to have replied, "That every
means should be tried for the settle
ment of a dispute before it be taken
to the law courts."

Young Matron— Why so pensive,
dear? Angelina— l'm desperate! Will

TRIP TO A FIXED STAR.
Would Be a Long Jonrncr Even With
Tranapottction FacilitieH.
There is a perpetual fascination about
the stars and the immense distances at
which they lie from one another and
from us. To demonstrate the vast dis
tance of Centauri from this planet a
popular scientist gives the following
illustration in London Answers: "We
shall suppose that some wealthy direct
ors, for want of outlet for their en
ergy and capital, construct a railway to
Centauri. AYe shall neglect for the
present the engineering difficulties, a
mere detail, and suppose them over
come and the railway open for traffic.
We shall go further and suppose that
the directors have found the construc
tion of such a railway to have been pe
culiarly easy and that the proprietors
of Interstellar space had not been ex
orbitant In their terms for right of
way.
"Therefore, with a view to encourage
traffic, the directors have made the fare
exceedingly moderate— viz, first class
at 1 penny per hundred miles. Desir
ing to take advantage of these facili
ties, a gentleman, by way of providing
himself with small change for the jour
ney, buys up the national debt of Brit
ain and a tew other countries and, pre
senting himself at the office, demands
a first class single fare to Ceutaurl.
"For this he tenders in payment the
price of the ticket, £1,100,000,000.
"Having taken his seat, it occurs to
him to ask:
" 'At what rate do you travel?'
" 'Sixty miles an hour, sir, including
stoppages,' is the answer.
" 'Then when shall we reach Centau
ri?'
" 'In 48,603,000 years, sir!' "
HENRY BELL'S COMET.
The First Steamer That Plied For
Hire In Great Britain.
Among the curiosities of advertising
may surely be placed the first ad
vertisement of the first steamer that
plied for hire in Great Britain— namely,
Henry Bell's Comet. Thus ran the ad
vertisement in the Glasgow Courier of
1812:
"Steam passage boat, the Comet, be
tween Glasgow, Greenock and Helens
burg. For passengers only. The sub
scriber having at much expense fitted
up a handsome vessel to ply upon tha
river Ciyde between Glasgow and
Greenock — to sail by the power of
wind, air and steam— he intends that
the vessel shall leave the Broomielaw
on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Satur
days about midday or at such time
thereafter as may answer from tho
state of the tide and to leave preenock
on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
in the morning to suit the tide. The
elegance, comfort, safety and speed
of this vessel require only to be proved
to meet the approbation of the public,
and the proprietor is determined to do
everything in his power to merit public
encouragement. The terms are for the
present 4 shillings for the best cabin
and 3 shillings for the second, but be
yond these rates nothing is to be al
lowed to servants or any other person
employed about the vesse)."
What would poor neglected Henry
Bell have said could he have seen his
humble little Comet, of whose elegance,
comfort and speed he was so proud,
alongside a modern ocean racer or one
of the latest palatial river steamers of
the Clyde or Thames, all so well ad
vertised?— Chambers' Journal.
Why Timothy Grass Is So Called.
The forage grass known to the farm
ers of the United States as timothy is
so called because first introduced and
extensively cultivated in this country
by one Timothy Hanson, a farmer of
Maryland. This species of grass is
well known In England and all over
western continental Europe, where It
is grown extensively by most farmers
between the Mediterranean and the
North seas. The botanical name of this
grass is Phleum pratense. Timothy is
known in the British isles as cat's tail
grass and in several of our eastern
states as herd, or herd's, grass. It was
grown In large quantities in Maryland
and Pennsylvania long before a speai
of it had ever been seen in England,
the first seed of it ever seen in the last
named country being imported from
America.
The "If" Is Rather Important.
Here's something that may sa<ve
your life when a bull gets after you:
When a bull charges, just before the
final lurch he shuts his eyes, and if
you have the presence of mind to
stand stock still until he is about two
or three feet from you all you have to
do is to step aside, and he misses you.
Any child with sufficient presence of
mind to do this can let a bull charge
all day with perfect safety. This ia
not a new thing, ms it is one of the se
crets of the bullfighter in the coun
tries where the sport: is practiced. The
bullfighters say that a cow does not
do this, and they would never try any
such tricks with a mad cow.

We cannot help living in some degree
the lives of heroes who are constantly
in our minds. Our characters are con
stantly being modified, shaped and
molded by the suggestions which are
thus held. The most helpful life sto
ries for the average youth are not the
meteoric ones, the unaccountable ones,
the astonishing ones, like those of Na
poleon, Oliver Cromwell and Julius
Caesar. The great stars of the race
dazzle most boys. They admire, but
they do not feel that they can imitate
them. They like to read their lives,
but they do not get the helpfulness and
the encouragement from them that
they do from reading the lives of those
who have not startled the world so
much. It Is the triumph of the or
dinary ability which Is most helpful as
an inspiration and encouragement.
The life of Lincoln has been an in
finitely greater Inspiration to the world
than the life of Napoleon or that of
Julius Caesar.— O. S. Marden In Suc

PINK LEMONADE.
'- ::e Story of Ita Introduction to the
Circns Public. •
"Old reter Conklin, the clown," said
a circus official, "was the first to give
pink lemouade to the world.
"It dates back to 1857, when Conklin
was traveling in the south with Jeie
Maine's big show. Conklin had a dis
pute with Mabie and jumped the show
down iv Texas. I've had the story
right from his owu lips. He bought a
couple of mules and an old covered
wagon, some tubs, tartaric acid, a
lemon, a bushel or two of peanuts and
started iv the refreshment business.
He followed tho circus with his wagou,
aud every time the tents were pitched
he would mouut a box and harangue
the crowd with:
"Here Is your lee cold lemonade,
Made In Ihe shade.
Stick your finger in the glass;
It'll freeze fast.
"The lemonade sold splendidly, and
he couldn't wait ou the people fast
enough. One day he was surrounded
by a mob for 'the juice,'
when his water supply ran out. There
were no wells or springs at band. He
rushed into the big tent, but there was

stop to ask any questions. Ho grabbed
up the tub and ran. Into tho tub he
threw some acid and the property lem
on and called out:
" 'Come quickly. Buy some flue
strawberry lemonade.'
"His sales were dpu,bjed that day,

BRUNSWICK STEW.
A Gastronomic Triumph With a Na-
tional Reputation.
This celebrated stew originated in
Brunswick county, Va., from which it
takes Its name — a county most famous
in antebellum days for its perfect
cuisine and gastronomical predilec
tions. The originator was either Mr.
Haskins or Mr. Stith, each claiming
during a long life the distinction of
having made the first stew and dying
without a proper adjustment of the con
troversy. While made everywhere In
the habitable globe, it is seldom made
properly. It was introduced in Paris
by Judge John T. Mason of Virginia.
Ouly iv Brunswick county is this stew
so appetizing, so piquant in the season
ing to be fouud iv all its perfection.
To this remark of tho writer made to
a gentleman in the far south he re
plies, "The egotism of a Virginian
suggests perfection in all things there,
and the slow pace of the state ample
time to arrive at it." The recipe is as
follows: One of three kinds of meat is
used— lamb, chicken or squirrel. If
chicken. It Is first parboiled, cut up as
if to fry, the outer skin removed, then
put on in hot water— a-plenty to cover
it— a large onion cut fine, a large slice
of middling meat cut tine, black and
red pepper Iv abundance and salt.
After cooking until the bones can be
extracted, and hot water added if not
enough, corn cut off the cob and to
matoes chopped fine are added, with
half a pound of butter, more pepper
and salt. Before serving add stale
light breadcrumbs. Never add Irish
potatoes or butter beans or any vege^
table savt» corn and tomatoes. Serve
in a tureen. It should be the consist
ency of thick soup and very highly sea
soned. It is considered one of the
finest of stews aud has a national
reputation.— Richmond Times.
"Americanisms."
"Fired out," commonly supposed to
be an "Americanism," has been traced
home to Shakespeare. In one of his
sonnets he says:
Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live Iv
doubt
Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
"Say," as au exclamation to attract
attention to the beginning of a remark,
is common enough and not very ele
gant. At least so thought a school
teacher who resolved ta break his pu
pils of the habit of using it. A bright
one quoted, however, this from "Tha
Star Spangled Banner:"
Oh, say, can you see?
If the American people sing "say!"
iv the national hymn, say, why not say
"Say?"
As to Bow Legs.
A bow legged man usually possesses
more than ordinary strength. Why?
Because his legs in supporting great
weight can bend in one direction only,
whereas the man with straight legs is
Inclined to be wabbly. Such being the
case, why should not a knock kneed
man be stronger than a bow legged
one? His knees, being braced against
each other, ought to be more steadfast
than legs bending outward. Yot we all
know that the knock kneed man gener
ally goes into consumption and is at all
times weaker than his bow legged
brother. — New York Press.
Optimistic Sure.
Xewberry-Is Sanford of an opti
mistic temperament? Baldwin — I
should say he Is. I have known him
to go into a restaurant without a cent
in his pocket, order a dozen oysters
and feel satisfied that ho could pay hln
bill with a pearl.— Life.
Just Playing Poaanin.
"So you are going to retire from poli
tics?"
"Yes," said the municipal boss, "I'm
goin£ to retire. But I'm not going to
sleep so soundly that I can't be awak
ened."
Men ought not to Investigate things
from words, but words from thingfl. —
My son.
E Explicit.
"Tell me," requests the young per
son, entering the study of tho gray
bearded philosopher, "what is the dif
ference between friendship and love?"
The gray bearded philosopher studies
the table thoughtfully for a 'moment
or two, then replies: "Friendship, my
son, is a mutual understanding; love
Is a mutual misunderstanding."— Life.
