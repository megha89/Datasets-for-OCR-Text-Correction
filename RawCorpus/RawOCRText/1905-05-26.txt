The Power of Eloquence
W. Bob Holland
Nearly the whole town hail assem
bled to watch the final struggle tor
the life of John l'reetiiau. 11 « was o'i
trial lor the murder of Oyius Max
well, and all the evidence li>ul been
hoard.
The . prosecution had eetalilisLed a
strong circumstantial case — there was
no direct evidence of the pi i-mner'd
guilt.
" Cyrus Maxwell is dead," usserted
one citizen, "aud some one killed
him. If John Freeman dliln'l do it,
who did? Tell me that?"-'
No one could {tell, and the belief
was general that Freeman would be
convicted. He said tbat be had no
money, aud a young attorney trlio felt
little interest in the case had been
appointed to defend "him."
A few days before the trial a strau
ger appeared, had a consul tatiou with
the prisoner and later met (be I'risou
er's counsel. The aunnuueemniJt was
then made that the newcomer was ru
attorney, woulJ be associated wit ti the
ilt-tense. Hut (luring the trial tho two
attorneys did little, mid the crot-a
oxofn i nations <>£ the state'u «Unen6es
wero perfunctory. The straugo uilor
npy took no part in them, and jjiaid
but little atteutiou to the trial.
The prisoner was a young man ant'
comparatively a stranger. The man
lie was licensed ot slaying was not re-
as a particularly desirable
citizen; if a plea of self defeune had
baen made and had beeu fairly well
established, the community would
have been clad it John Freeman hud
been set free. But the deleuse was
an alibi, tLe most dangerous defense
that can be made when it is not clear
ly proven; and John Freeman did not
prove v complete alibi.
Few witnesses wero examined fur the
defense; theu the strauge attorney
rose to make a plea for the prisoner,
tie was tall and dignified. His smooth
jhaven face was clean aud his eyes
were sharp. Pictures of such a face
may be found banging on tho walls ot
many a state uapitol iii tho South.
His hair was white aud long and as
line as silk. His frock cnat wag but
toned tightly around bis slender form
and a black string tie was knotted
around bis tall collar.
The attorney paid no attention to
the jury. He addressed the court and
said a few words tbat were scarcely
audible to those in the jury box, and
which were entirely lost to the spec
tators tbat crowded the court room.
Then he turned to the prisoner, gazed
for a moment on the young man, and
said:
"John, my boy, you must die. You
must leave the world in which you
have spent only your youth, and must
go to another world about which we
have all surmised much, but of which
we know little. And you must die by
hanging.
"You must die the death of a felon
in the manner prescribed by the stat
ute. But it will be through no tault
of yours, and through no fault of the
judge 01 jury. And it is no fault of
the law. The law of this great com
monwealth is all right, John, though
you die innocent.
" The law may sometimes Expose
perjury, but it cannot always reach
the man who swears falsely. It cannot
always take into account the mistakes
of human judgment, to say nothing of
the deliberate falsifier who wants to
swear away another man's life.
Judges and juries have not the power
of Almighty God, though they some
times exercise his authority.
"The human mind cannot look down
into the hearts end jnjpds of men and
see the malice, hate, vindjctjypnoss
and private purposes that will color
facts until they seem to mean some
thing entirely different from what
they do nj.ean.
'But it is too lati? to change all that.
We can't help it now { «uwj you must
die as you have lived, a brave man,
"1 know tbat you will do that. You
come ot a race of brave men and brave
women. You mJI go to your death as
uncomplainingly as «vor R man ac
cepted the cards that fate dealt to
him. Your mother, when she was a
bride and yet ;n her teens, carried
from a bloody battledtld fhe bleed
ing, senseless form of your father,
shot dowD on the plantation where he
was bora. Apd as she carried her
loved one to tbe shelter of the old
brick house in which you first saw the
light of day, bullets and shells whis
tled around her and the shrieks of
the wounded and dying tilled the air.
" Your father reoovered, and for
many years he repaid by his tender
devotion the bravery of that loving
wife. We laid his maimed body to
rest only last week, John, lie is
.sleeping with his forebears in the
little cemetery you remember so well,
and in which 1 promise that you
shall rest. You have lived and will
die ainosg strangers, John, but your
body will theu Jie among your kins
men, by the side of that father and
another who loved you so well.
"But this case does not end here,
John. There is another woild and
another judge. Your parents are
there, John, hi«<J you will be with
them soon. And them this case will
be tried again before a judge who is
all wise, and before whom false wit
nesses are stricken dumb. Your father
and mother will attend tbat trial; and
when the final verdict is rendered
they will know that tbeir confidence
in their boy has not been misplaced,
and tbat when tried before a judge
who needs not the aid of counsel or
jury the verdict will be " not guil
ty."
The tall lawyer stepped in front of
the prisoner, who was sobbing audi
bly, took both of hia hands and hold

the tear stained face. Then he
stooped and kissfed the prisoner twico
in tho forehead, as he s^aid iv v low
voice: "We can wait for thHt day. So
good bye, John, my boy."
The lawyer s«t down be-iilo the pris
oner, hold ug one of his bands. The
prosecuting attorney ro.-.p, cleared bis
throat, and begau his speech. H6 did
not talk long, aud ho clused with a
request that the members of the jury
do tbeir duty.
The judge's charge was scattering
and disconnected, and the jury paid
little attention to it.
The jury rendered a verdict of "Not
guilty" within teu minutes, and fif
teen minutes later the ncquitted mnu
was in a room jn the hotel with tbe
gray haired lawyer.
"Your father,' said the lawyer, "has
settled v ith me. And he gave rue five
hundred dollars whicb I am to band
to you with the uuderstnndiug that
you leave the United States at once.
He says that he has helped you out of
trouble tbe last time he will, but tbat
if you will go to Australia, South
America, Africa or China, you will
receive through me two hundred dol
lars every throe months.
" But he also says that if you ever
communicate with him directly. 01
write to your mother, he will cut off
the allowance. And 1 guess you and I
both know him well enough to know
thet he will do as be says.
" You will go to South Ameiica?

THE UNITED STATES THE. ONLY
DUMP.
A British paper observes that an
official document has been issued on
the prospects of emigration from the
United Kingdom at tbe present time
from which it appears tbat emigrants
will not be allowed to land in Cape
Colony unle Q s they have previously
secured employment, or possess at
least twenty pounds. There seems to
be no hope for the emigrant in Natal.
He is warned not to go ouf unless he
obtains a"nominated passage through
friends in the Colony. " No one can
enter either the Transvaal or tbe
Orange River Colony without a per
mit. In both the supply of labor ex
ceeds the demand.
Canada wants farm laborers "as
soon as posible, " but they must know
their business, must be able to milk,
to look after cattle, horses, sheep, or
pigs, aud miiat know something about
tbe killing and dressing nf animals.
But for mechanics there is no de
mand. New South Wales does not
want any more emigrants. Victoria
offers no prospect except to dairy far
mers and fruit growers, with a little
oapital, while South Australia has no
welcome for anyone who has not bad
experience of fruit growing and gen
eral farming, and in addition about
2000 or 3000 pounds to exploit. As
for Queensland, there is no demand
there for workers of any description.
The story from Western Australia is
bettor- There has been a demand for
agricultural tabqrers in a few districts
but only men who understand to some
extent machinery are required. Tas
mania is able to supply its own
labor, and only those with a tidy
purse are invited.

A striking example of the strange
resnlt of modern engineering science
is seen in Arizona. A dam in course
of construction as part of the govern
ment's reclamation plan will create a
great basin. In a low part of tbat

Letter from Alaska.
Rampait, Alaska, April 5, 1905.
Amador Ledger: —
Ouo of the fascinations of Arctic
life is the emphatic change in light
aud temperature in different seasons
Here the days iv December are less
than four hours long, while in June
there is absolutely no night, a soft
twilight bright enough to make Hnu
print legible, connecting sunset with
sunrise. Years ago the writer was
within a few degrees ot the equater
where day and night are equal the
whole year, twilight noticeable, and
the air sultry aud moist like that of
a green bouse. The natives were what
the climate made them, indolent and
careless, for clothes were not a neces
sity, and the luxuriance of vegeta
tion, could hardly be improved by
cultivation as cocoaunts, . bjuauas,
aud plantains grew wild iv such pro
fusion that no I bought tor the mor
row need be taken In this legion
(he natives are hunJlj mote ei.eigetic
than at the tropics; v log cabin
chinked with moss, and tcauly sup
ply of hMi or giiiuo. beiug enough to
satisfy the wants of un indiiu; any
excess being freely trudtd for whis
key, uuder the averted face ol the
officials. It is only in the temper
ate zone tbat a full development of
energy and intellect, seems po*s ble.

Supplies are plenty iv this caiiip,
aud most of the creeks are thickly
dotted with huge "dumps" of pay
dirt, which will be washed when the
sun melts (he snow. All winter min
ers have worked, cutting wood for
thawing the ground, pickiug aud
shoveling tb.e flirt, into bnckeis aud
hoisting it to the surface. Some
have steam plauts for thawing aud
hoisting. Frequent panning is neces
sary to keep iv the pay-streak. If
the pans average five cents it is pay
ing ground. " Ten cent dirt" is av
erage here. Last month one man
obtained $19,20 from three pans; an
other 548.25 from oue pan. The best
pan ever found iv this district was
$230. Tue gold is all coarse. I have
not seen any quicksilver used iv this
camp.
Alabkana feel much diHuppoiuted be
cause congress not only failed to do
justice to her needs, but has also iu
timated that it never intends to do so.
This region is just as much misunder
stood as was (Jaljforuia some fifty
years ago, when Dauiel Webster de
clared it to be a desert, that would
never be of any practical benefit to
the couutry. AlasKa has millions of
acres of fine fanning !and, where the
climate is milder than that of New
England; and millions more no worse
than that of Montana or South Dak
ota. The total area ot Alaska is more
than three hundred and fifty million
acres (350, 000,0001. Much ot this will
attract a large immigration as soon as
the truth becomes generally known.
And probably in time the tyrannical
misrule under which -ye have so long
suffered will be a thing of the past.
But it will not look well in history to
read that our pretended free govern
ment exacted a tax from Alaskans
moie oppressive than king George
ever tried to wring ffoij, the polonies.
It amounts to more than thirteen hun
dred dollars for every day in the year.
Inflicted a carpet bag government on
the district. " There is only one U. S.
official in all Alaska who resided here
when appointed, and residents cannot
even vote tor a justice of the peace.
When the senate committee, who bad
been here and investigated the needs
of the region, introduced a bill pro
viding among other things for a dele
gate from Alaska, senator Platt ot
Connecticutt offered an amendment,
declaring that nothing in the act
should be construed to indicate : hat
Alaska should ever be allowed to be
come a state. This amendment was
offered March 10th, 1904, and is on
page 3250 of the Congressional Kecord.
The bill was killed. Alaska has no
delegate, ie not. allowed to be organ
ized into a territory, although she has
more than fifty thousand white people.
Washington was made a territory when
it had less than three thousand. Mon
tana was the only territory organized
with a larger population than Alaska.
Hawaii has a delegate. The Kanakas
seem to be pets. Uncle Sam spent
more than a million dollars for the
Filipino exhibi at St.' Louis fair, aud
just fifty thousand for Alaska.
The reasons for this unfair discrim
ination seem to be that Alaskans are
generally too busy with their private
affairs to spend much time in kick
ing. AJsp that they bsj-p put faith in
the promises for reform tbat every
junketing congressional committee
has so readily made. Moreover that
Alaska is a convenient dumping
ground for political backs that every
administration is bothered with, and
glad to get rid of.

"JOE" JEFFERSON'S
THEORY OF IMMORTALITY.
It is now related since Jefferson's
doath that .on one of their limbing ex
cursions afewyeiir.s since with his in
timate friends, E. C. Benedict, and
former President Cleveland, Mr.
Jefferson recited the following origi
nal verses, which hn termed doggerel,
as expiessive ;.f his views of the
future life:
Two caterpillars crawling on a leat,
By some strange accident iv con
tact came;
Their conversation, passing all belief.
Was that same argument, the very
same,
That has been "proed and conned"
from man to man,
Yea, ever since this wonderous world
began.
-..The ugly creatures,
■ Deaf and dumb aud blind, "■ '
Devoid of features
That adorn umukind,
Were vain enough, iv dull and world
ly strito,
To speculate upon a iutnre life,
The first whs oplimitlic, full of hope:
The second, quite dyspeptic, seemed
to mope.
Said number oue, "I'm sure ot our
salvation."
Said number two, "I'm sure of our
damnation;
Our ugly forms alono wonld seal our
fates
And bar tbe entrance through the
i golden gates.
Suppose that death should take ns
unawares,
How could we climb the golden stairs
It luiiifteu-i sbuu us us they pass us by
Would angels bid us welcome in the
: sky?
1 wonder what great crimes we have
committed,
That leaves us so forlorn and so un
•■";■ pitied.
Perhaps we've been ungrateful, un
forgiving;
"Tie plain to me that life's not wprtb
the living."
"Come, come, cheer up," the jovial
worm replied,
'Let's take a look upou the other side
Suppose we cannot fly like moths or
millers,
Are we to blame lor being cater
pillars?
Will that same God that doomed an
crawl the earth,
A prey to every bird that's given birth
Forgive our captor as he eats and
sings,
Aud damn poor us because we have
not wings?
It we can't skim tbe air like owl or
bat,
A worm will turn 'tor a that." ■
They argued through the summer;
autumn nigb,
Tho ugly things composed themselves
to die;
And so to make their funeral com
plete,
Each wrapped himself in his little
winding sheet.
The tangled web encompassed them
full soon;
Each for his coffin mado him a cocoon
All though the winter's chilling bla^t
they lay
Dead to the world, aye, dead as hu
man clay.
Lo, spring comes forth with all her
warmth and love;
Sho brings sweet justice from the
realms above;
She breaks the chrysalis, she result
rects the dead;
Two butterflies ascend encircling her
head.
And so this emblem shall forever be
A sign of immortality.

DEATH OF JOHN 11. COX.
John 11. Cox, a former resident ot
Araador county, died last week in
San Francisco. He attended ditch for
many j years tor the Amador Caual,
on the Clinton beat. For some time
he has been employed in the city,
his family having moved there several
years ago. He will be remembered as
a man of many sterling qualities, and
bis many triends throughout the
county will regret to hear of his
death, j The Examiner of the 19tb, has
the following account of his demise:
On October 11,1904, Cox, who was 74
years of age and a native of Prince
Edward's Island, injured his baud
with a lusty nail while removing
building debris at Fillmore street
aud Duboce aveuue. His wife, his
two sons and his daughter-in-law say
that on October 17th he wont under
the treatment ot Dr. Carl Yon Tiede
mann, land that he remained under
Yon' Tiedemnnn's treatment until
April sth. They say that You Tiede
mann contracted to cure Cox for
3100, and that they'paid him 575 of
that amount. You Tiedeiusiu says he
was discharged three mouths ni;n.
wheu a Christian scientist was called
into the case, it was for tbat reason,
sqys Yon Tiedemauu, that be refused
to sign the death certificate. •
Detective Cody says that after Yon
liedemann gave up the case Silas M.
Cox, a son of John H. Cox, called in
Charles M. Howe, a, ottristnu scien
tist, with offlqe in the Phelan build
ing. This, says Cody, was done
against the wishes of the sick man's
wife, his other son and his daughter
in-law. The final result was that
Cox died of gangreue of the left foot.
Now, Dr. Dudley Taft of the State
Board ot Medical Examiners hss been
called in tor the purpose of handling
Yon Tiedemann. Tait has been pro
secuting Yon Tiedemann on the
charge of practicing mediciue with
out a licence, and tho coroner thinks
that Tait should know till about You
Tiedemaun's connection with the
Cox case.

THE SCHOOL CENSUS.
The school census returns as'pub
lished in another column are of much
interest from several standpoints.
From these returns we have com
piled the follow-in:: table showing
the juvenile popul:*; : ;. '>i of school ajje
by townships for the past two years,
with the loss or gain in each:
18«J4 1895 Loss Gain
Township 1 779 SO4 . . 25
Township 2 446 448 . . " 2
Township 3 328 322 6 V. 1
Township 4 491 498 \.\ 7
TownshipS 326 305 21
It will thus be seen that the only
.nalerial gain is in township one,
the heavy increase in Jackson dis
trict being more thau sufficient to
Offset the loss in the rural districts.
Township one has over one-third of
the census children^ while Jackson
alone lias one-fifth. The yam in
the county seat would indicate an in
crease of about 200 to our population
during the year. Indeed, the tide
of population continues to be
away from outlying districts, and
in favor of the towns. Town-trip 5
is the greatest loser, indicating a
loss of 100 in total population in
twelve months.
But by far the most serious aspect
of the census is the steady decline
of the infant population. We have
lost 64 children under live years in
the past year. The logical conclu
of this is an alarming decline of the
birth rate. Children are passing
into the schoolroom without a corre
sponding filling of the gaps in the
ranks of the under age infants. If
this tendency is general— as it prob
ably is- it shows a decreasing birth
rate. The natural increase of popu
lation is not sufficient to offset the
ravages of death. This tendency is
perhaps more pronounced iv a min
ing community like Amador than in
an agricultural section; inasmuch as
the proportion of married men is no
doubt smaller, while the death-rate
is larger, owing to the perils inci
dent to a miner's life. Still the
same drift, in a less marked degree
perhaps, is noticeable in other sec
tions, warranting the inference that
a similar condition of affairs prevails
throughout the couutry.
Much is said about the immense
immigration into the United States
from the overcrowded empires of
Europe. The majority of these ref
ugees are of the undesirable class —
illiterate and without means. They
crowd into the large cities, showing
an indisposition to branch out into
the country, where employment is less
difficult to secure. It is estimated
that over a million foreigners have
landed in this country during the
past years, beating all past records
in this line. This tremendous influx
is becoming agave problem, that con
gress must soon grapple with. What
effect the suspension of this human
inflow will have upon the already
dwindling birth rate is auother
problem that looms up in the
future, which is of almost equal
gravity with the one of unlimited
immigration that now confronts us.

A SWEEPING LAW.
The folly of onu-muu legislation is
at this early stage becoming apparent.
The creation of the office of code com
inissionoi, aud giving that official the
power to doctor the laws to suit his
own notion, aud after fixing them tip
to his own satisfaction, have the leg
islature pass them not only without
discussion, but oven without know
ing their import, is bearing its evil
fruit. Aud the crop of evil promises
to be superabundant indeed. The
particular law that is just liow ex
posed by the searchligh of public
opinion, relates to the sa'oon busi
ness. The law as now cud i Hud reads
as follows :
Sectiou 1. Rectiou 172 of the Penal
Code is hereby amended to read as
follows :
172. .Every person who, within two
miles of the land belonging to this
State upon which any State prison or
reformatory is situated, or within one
mile. of the grounds belonging and ad
jacent to tho University of California,
or within one and one half miles of
the lands occupied by any home, re
treat or asylum, or disabled voluuteer
soldiers or sailors establisbep or to
be established by this State, or with
in the State Capitol, or within tlio
limits of the grounds adjacent and
belonging thereto, sells, gives away,
exposes for sale. " any vinous or al
coholic liquors, is guilty of a mis
demeanor.
A strict interpretation ot this law
will put out of business all the sa
loons iv Stockton, nearly all in San
Francisco, all iv Folsom, aud other
towns where state institutions exist.
It has a bearing iv Amador county,
as eveiy saloou iv louo is within the
proscribed limit of tne Preston re
form school, aud must closo if the
law is to be enforced, liut the fram
ers say such was not the intention
of the lawmakers. That is the lamest
kind of an excuse. The truth is, the
legislators in the huiry of rushing
through the bills from the code com
missioner trusted implicitly to that
official. They did not know the import
of the measures; aud it would seem
that the code commissioner himself
was iv the same fix. Whore the mean
iuc of a law is in doubt, the inten
tion of the lawmakers may be called
in to aid the courts in construing the
enactment. Hut iv this case the
wording is plain, aud incapable of
misconstruction. If the anti-saloon
element had beeu given the making
of the law, they could hardly have
improved upon its present status from
their ' standpoint. Will it be en
forced? In Folsom the saloon men
say they will pay no heed to it; but
the district attorney says public sen
timent does not sanction allowing
such laws to become dead statutes.
It is certain that there is enough ot
the anti-saloon feeling iv this and
other counties interested to make an
effort to have 'lie law complied witn,
aud cause a lot of trouble aud litiga
tion and all because our legislators
made laws without due considera
tion.
HOW THEY WORK.
The Ledger is not in the habit of
paiadiug its policy or its management
before the public. It has always pre
ferred to allow the public 1o draw its
own conclusions on such matters from
a perusal of its columns. We have
always pursued a straight course in
the interest of the people generally,
according to our best judgment. As
a rule, newspaper patrons are an in
telligent class, and can discern the
chaff from the wheat in the field of
journalism. We have never deviated
from our course from a fear of losing
a subscriber or an advertising patron.
We have looked for support from an
appreciative public, rather than from
those who do politics for a living.
The court house combine has no love
for the Ledger, because they cannot
dictate its course. We will not shape
our views for the purpose of securing
a portion of their patronage. It is
needless to say that we get precious
little of it: Most of them would send
their work clean outside the county
rather than have it done at the Led
ger. They expect a paper to adapt i:s
views to accord with their own on
local matters, in order to sit at the
pie counter supported by the taxpay
ers' money. This we have not done,
and will not do. Our opinions are
not for sale, either openly, or indi
rectly in the manner indicated. And
it is a fact that those who pander to
this subserviency of the press con
tribute next to nothing in the way of
taxes to the funds so used for the sup
port of favorites. And the recipients
of the favors are mostly iv the same
category.
We are prompted to make these re
marks from the following facts just
brought to our notice. A legal adver
tisement was sent to us from a town
ship officer. As soon as it appeared
in these colums the official received a
communication from a newspaper
office iv this county, insolently com
plaining because that particular paper
had not been favored with the notice.
The protest, among other things, re
ferred to the justices' and constables'
salary bill, stating that the paper
stood in with the officers on that
well-known grab game, carrying the
the idea that that paper was entitled to
such advertising. The Ledger's stand
in defense of the taxpayers on that
proposition, and against the looting
of the treasury by beating down the
constitutional provisions by judicial
ipsi dixit, is a matter of history, Dur
ing that long struggle even the
officials who were contesting the law
in the interest "of the county, gave the
printing patronge growing out of the
lawsuit to a paper that opposed them
and stood in for the grab game. The
only paper— the Ledger — that ap
proved the appeal to the supreme
court, got nil. It expected nothing,
aud was not disappointed. Such is
the spirit of democratic politics. But
now comes tnis latest apostle of the
you-tickle-me-and - I'll - tickle - you
school, and want the Ledger boycot
ted for daring to express its convic
tion on local affairs. The Ledger gets
it therefore from both sides of the
fence. Such methods are discredit
able indeed, and beneath contempt.

which fails of perfect digestion ferments and
swells the stomach, putting It up against the
heart. This Interferes with the action of

While on this subject we may also
mention another branch of clique
tactics against the ledger. False
hoods are being circulated that this
otllce is not equipped for posters, the
object boiug to divert that class of
work elsewhere As a matter of fact
the Ledger has tho largest and best
assortment of poster type, as well as
other type aud print ing material, than
any print shop in the county, and
cau turn out work, from a vising card
to a three sheet poster, in better shape
than any of its leagued competitors. We
can afford to scoru sucli disreputable
Way, but nevertheless we wish to say
that if wo hear any more of ■ such un
derhauded business, we shall make a
move that will probably upset the
calculations of our cotemporaries to
au infinitely greater degree than these
miserable plottings disturd the Ledger
establishment.

JACKSON WILL CELEBRATE.
Arrangeweuts Made for v Big Time
ou the Fourth.
A vv«ll attended meeting of citizens
interested in the celebration of tiie
coming fourth of July was held iv
Webb building on Sunday last, to
make arraugemeuts for a gala diy
at the count}' seat. There were ovoi
twenty business men present, and i'.ll
expressed themselves as willing to
take hold in any way possible to help
along the movement.
J. McCutcuen presided, aud B.C.
Rust, the secretary was present to
take minutes.
The soliciting committee, through
W. Tarn, chairman, annouueed tl it
after a through canvass of tlie town,
the sum of $700 had beeu subscribed,
without reckouing the 542 surplus
from the last celebration. This to
gether with the receipts from the bull
will make over $900 as the gross a
niouut to spend on the celebration;
a sum which ought to be ample to
secure an unusually attractive pio
gram of amusement', aud other fea
tures customary ou such occasions.
It was rnuved aud carried, that' the
showing financially was ample to war
rant the citizen iv proceeding with
Ad executive committee, with lull
power to appoint all subordinate
working committees to carry out the
celebration, and make all prelimin
ary arrangements was appointed by
the chairman as follows:
J. McCutcheu, C. M. Kelly, C. Ma
relia, W. Tain,' James Meehan. This
committee was empowered to fill any
and all vacancies. It is really the
committee having the oversight aud
charge of the whole affair. The
meeting thereupon adjourned ,to
meet again at the call of the chair.
The committee of arraugemeuts
held a meeting on Tuesday, aud
elected James Meehan chairman, and
C. M. Kelly .secretary. The matter
of securing, an orator was left in the
hands of Judge Rust. The committee
have started to woik, all the members
displaying willingness to take hold
in earnest with the object of securing
a glorious celebration. Aud there is
no doubt that with such a spirit up
permost the affair will be carried to
a complete success.

A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.
John Fredino, a youngster five or
six years old, attempted to get on tbe
tongue of the backaotion ot Piccar
do's freight team last Friday, while
passing tbe Hamilton tract. In so
doing be fell, and the wagon passed
over the child's body. Fortunately
tbe wagon was empty; but there was
considerable of a scare in the neigh
borhood, as it was teared the little
one bad sustained serious if not fatal
injuries. The doctor was sent for,
and it was found that beyond a few
bruises the victim was little the
worse for tbe ordeal.
Marshal Ulavinovicb, sou of L.Ghtv
inovicb, ran a splinter two aud a half
iucbes into bis thigh last luesd-ty,
requiring the aid of a surgeon to
remove it.
Mrs. £. Gordon, mother of school
superintendent Gordon, while around
her residence on Broadway met with
a serious mishap. She bad a fall in
some way, and injured her right arm
badly. Tbe arm was so much swollen
that tbe medical attendant was uu
able to tell tbe extent ot tbe injury.
The victim is advanced in years, aud
this fact makes tbe mishap assume a
more serious character. She is get
ting along nicely, however, under the
circumstances.

MINING NOTES.
The Bay State or Rbetta mine has
suspended operations temporarily.
Nothing is doing except keeping tbe
water out. It is thought that work
will be resumed in a short time.
Two loittls of machinery consist ing
of h hoisl, passed through town yes

Unrliiigton mine near Sntter .Creek.

THE RAILWOAD PROGRESS.
Tha railroad track id completed to
Martell's illation. The first carload
of freight arrived there Wednesday.
It was some ot tbe machinery for
the Staudard Electric Company,
which wout through town to the
plaut on Thursday moruiug. The
road is no', and will not be for some
time, open for general fi eight traffic.
Only carload lots, .v ill betaken at
Grading beyoud tbe Oueida depot
is being pushed ahead. -This looks
like oomiug to Jackson without delay.
We understand that the project of
ruuniug an independent tract from
Oueida to the east shaft of tbe Ken
nedy has fallen through. The grad
ing for this Hue w«s too costly to
warrant tbe undertaking at the rail
road company's expense. But the
through Hue to to'vu appears to be
more probable now than ever.
Tbe matter of raising subscriptions
to purchase the right of way to Jack
son has been taken hold of the past
week. Wilford Dennis bas interview
ed a number aud received such en
couragement that he left Monday for
San Francisco to lay the matter be
fore a meeting of tho railroad author
ities. _ The meeting was held
Tuesday, and it was thought that
tbe question of extending the line to
town would be definitely settled.'";
An estimate of tlie sum required to
purchase the right of way along tbe
surveyed route bas been made. It is
figured that tbe cost should not ex
ceed from $2000 to $3000, allowing a
liberal price lor the land. Meanwhile
some money has actually been paid
by citizens to tbe company or agent
acting in tbeir interest for bringing,
tbe road to Jackson. Five hundred
dollars have been paid, aud subscrip
tions for as much again have been
taken in tbe sam» behalf.
A WEDDING ROMANCE.
A wedding was solemnized in the
Greek church lust Suuday morning,
which has more ot the romance of
lova about it than anything that has
occurred here for some time. The
contracting parties were Samuel. Vu
kasovioli and Bosilka Dragolovich,
both uatives of Austria. They were
engaged in ■ tbe old country.' Tim
groom left his uative laud about four
years ago lo carve his way in tbe
world, and provide for his intended
bride, who romaiuod ou her native
soil until such time as fortune
favored tbeir union. Vukasovioh made
his way to Jackson, were his auut,
Mrs. Savich, has lived for years. He
secured employment in tbe mines,
and after four years of industrious
work, be was in a position to con
summate tbe plighted troth witb tbe
lady ot his choice. At his request
tbe bride left her friends and rela
tives and birtblaud behind, crossed
the ocean and coutiuent and reached
the cud of her jounrey about oue
mouth ago. She also bas relatives
here, au auut and unole, Mr. and
Mrs. Dragolovich. Tbe marriage li
cense was secured Saturday morning.
aud there is something of tbe roman
tic about that. Tho uew law requir
ing both contracting parties to be
present at the application for the
marriage license went into effect
that day at noon, so that this license
was tbe last issued in this county un
der the old law, the bride was not
required to attend and take tbe oatb.
In tbe presence of mauy friends tbe
happy pair were united for life by
the Key. I'ather Paskovsky. Steve
Savicb, a cousin of the groom actiug
best man, and Mrs. Draglovicb ap
pearing for the bride. The newly
wedded couple will live for a while
with tbe family of Mr. and Mrs.
THAT BOGUS SILVER.
Some weeks ago we reported that
H. Scapucino had stumbled across an
old cache of silver, amouut iug it was
thought to trom $100 to $500, all in
50 cent pieces, except a portion that
bad been, melted by the beat of a flic
— either brush or of tbe cabin in
which the silver bad originally been
buried. The find was on the Jobu
Sullivan place near Volcano. It was
never dreamed that the ooin was bo
gus. Tbe finder went to considerable
trouble in melting down tbe metal
into a bar, and then lorwarded it to
San Franoisco in charge of John F.
Clute. News of the discovery reached
tbe city about tbe same time as tbe
bullion arrived, and detectives wete
on tbe trail of tbe consignee to see
what might become of the supposed
ooin. It was taken to tbe mint or
some other place where its value
might be ascertained; and it was pro
nunced bogus. The metal was prac
tically worthless. Tbe unmelted
coin bore tbe dutu of 1862, and it is
supposed that some counterfeiters
pursued their avocation in that local
ity in those days, when silver was
about double the price it is now. No
one seems to have any recollection of
such illicit operations in tbose days;
although it is said a cabin at one
time occupied tbe site of the rind.

AH Incident In Which Hlm Anns
Dickinson Figured.
Miss Anna Dickinson traveled every
where independently and saw human
nature In all of its lairs. Writing to a
woman friend once, she described a re
ception given by wealthy Chinamen In
i restaurant kept by Chi Lung In Saa
Francisco, and she was the guest of
honor. She said that she saw a serv
ant coming toward her with a box di
vided Into many compartments, with
different kinds of nuts and candles In
the smaller trays. She picked out half
a dozen or more and laid them on the
Brm of the chair, which served as a ta
ble. As the attendant passed on to
others she saw that each took only one
bonbon, and she was much embar
rassed. s3J
But when tbe servant approached the
phief Chinaman, the one who had orig
inated the reception, he took a large
handful, and those after him did the
game, and then Miss Dickinson felt re
lieved. She wrote:
"After I learned that I must have
shocked all of those educated, culture^
Chinamen as much as you or I should
bare been shocked If we had Invited a
Chinaman .whom we respected to djne
with us and he had taken a whole fried
chicken and torn It limb from limb at
our table. In such an event would you
or I have had the tact and courtesy to
have taken other chickens and thus
dismembered them?"

A Joke on the "Prophet."
Some time in Uie thirties of the last
ientury Prophet Joseph Smith, Sr., the
Mormon, and a party of his followers
were proselyting In Musklngum coun
ty, O. He appointed a certain daj
when he would show the people his
wonderful powers and that he was a
Becond Christ by walking on the wa
ters of Mud creek. The water was
always muddy. A day or two before
the time set grandmother's brother
Robert and a couple of neighbor boys
were accidentally attracted to the
Mormons working at the creek and.
concealing themselves, watched the
Mormons put down stakes and put
planks on them from bank to bank,
the plank resting about six Inches un
der water. After the Mormons left
the boys went down and took out tha
center plank, where the water* was
about ten feet deep. The next day
Balaam Smith came down to the creek
and, after a long exhortation, started
across the creek. He was all right
and on top till he came to the center,
where his "powers" seemed to leave
him, and he went to the bottom. Thin
was the end of Mormonism .In that
What Won the Girl.
.It was In a subway train. On the
lap of a woman, apparently her moth
er, sat a girl of some eighteen months.
Next to them was another mother with
her two-year-old son. Each woman
petted the other's child, and the boy
liked the attention and laughed and
pranced. The girl maintained a
straight face. She did not fret, nor
apparently did she want to cry, but if
the word can be used in the case of
one so young she was bored. The
petting of her own mother and of the
Outer woman clearly had no effect.
Then the little boy entered the lists.
Edging up to the child, he put his arms
Wound her neck and said, "I love 'oof*
Then it was that there broke over the
baby's face the first smile that had ap
peared since the . long subway ride
from Harlem began. And as for the
mothers, the usual, and natural com
ments as to prescience followed.— New
fork Tribune.
Letters of Marque.
Letters of marque and reprisal, aa
they were called, were first issued in
the time of Edward I. to give leave to
retaliate beyond the marches or limits
of a country for wrongs suffered at
the linuds of a power nominally at
peace. In this first instance they were
aimed at Portugal. About a hundred
years later two Hanse towns in Meck
lenburg, wishing to relieve their
prince, who was beleaguered in Stock
holm, issued letters of marque
thieves' letters, as the sufferers called
them— to nil the rascals of the Baltic,
authorizing them to victual the besieg
ed city. This done, they turned them
selves into a confederacy of sea rob
bers known as Victualing brothers, or
St. Vitalius' brothers, and rendered
the Scandinavian seas unsafe for half
a century.
All the News.
A wise editor says: "A man told us
the other day that we did not publish
all the things that happened. VCe
should say not. In the first place, there
is somebody else depending on. us for
a living. If we printed all that hap
pens we would soon be with the an
gels. In order to please the people we
must print only the nice things saifl
of them and leave the rest to gossip.
Yet It's a fact we don't publish all the
news. If we did wouldn't It make
spicy reading? But It Avould be for
one week only; the next week you
would read our obituary. All the
news Is all right when It's about the
other fellow.'''*

BOER TOBACCO.
Katives lie It, but It Ik Too Much
For White Men.
After Transvaal tobacco? but a long
way after, cornea V.xv. The name Is In
reality nowadays a I ilsuomer. for this
tobneco is grown l;r;.'.';y In Natal and
Cape Colony. It is ; \.>o cultivated in
the Orange Klver Colony, is sold by the
roll and can be obtained for about $8 a
pound If a whole roll Is purchased. It
Is also sold by the sack.
White men buy these sacks, but they
So not smoke the contents themselves;
ley use it to reward the Kaffir serv
ants for working overtime or doing any
Other meritorious action. The taste for
Transvaal tobacco 1< an acquired one.
It also takes a certain time before a
man gets used to the scent. Xo white
man who has come from a distance has
so far lived long enough to acquire a
liking for either the taste or the smell,
but it has its uses in the case of the
natives, and it 1s also useful If you
have an undesirable visitor whom you
are anxious to get rid of. Offer him a
pipe of Boer tobacco, and he will never
enter your house again.
The traders purchase this weed large
ly. They also use It upon the natives
In the shape of presents, as every Kaf
fir who makes a purchase in a country
store always asks for n free gift, and
the competition to secure the native
trade Is so acute that the request can
not be refused.— South Africa.
YOUR OPPORTUNITY.
Make l> Yonr Mind to Seek It Rath-
er Than Wait For It.
It Is a dangerous thing to wait for
opportunities until It becomes a habit.
Energy and Inclination for hard work
ooze out In the waiting. Opportunity
becomes Invisible to those who are do-
Ing nothing or looking somewhere else
for It. It Is the great worker, the man
who Is alert for chances, that sees
them.
Some people become so opportunity
blind that they cannot see chances any
where— they would pass through a gold
mine without noticing anything pre
cious—while others will find opportuni
ties In the most barren and out of the
way places. Bunyan found opportu
nity In Bedford Jail to write the great
est allegory in the world on the un
twisted paper that had been used to
cork his bottles of milk. A Theodore
Parker or a Lucy Stone sees an oppor
tunity to go to college In a chance to
pick berries. One boy sees an opening
to his ambition in a chance to chop
wood, wait on table or run errands,
where another sees no chance at all.
One sees an opportunity to get an edu
cation in the odds and ends of time,
evenings and half holidays, which an
other throws away.— O. S. Marden In
Success Magazine.
SUNDAY MEALS.
Do Not Overeat and Yon Will Feel
Better on Monday.
If it is desired to begin the week re
freshed and ready for labor, rested in
mind and body, the eating customs of
Sunday will have to be readjusted.
Have a later breakfast, if desired, but
have then a very light one even if you
are hungry, or, if it must be hearty,
then do not upset your digestive hab
its auy more than may be avoided and
have but two meals on that day and
eat no other. It would be far better to
have three light meals, lighter than
usual, if that could be arranged to fit
with the other household arrangements.
The custom of noon dinner on that day
arises from the usual absence of cook
or maid at the later one, and this may
be unavoidable. Very well, then; treat
this as a rest day for cook and diges
tive apparatus as well as from other
labors. Have a light breakfast, a light
dinner and a chafing dish supper as
near tho ordinary hours of meals as
possible and remember as you are go
ing to take less exercise than usual
you demand a lesser amount of more
easily digested food. — Helen Johnson
in Good Housekeeping.
"Off" For "From."
As a stranger in Philadelphia I was
much amused by certain provincial
isms. One of these was the use of the
word "off" Instead of "from." "Please
buy flowers off me," say the youthful
street venders. One day while waiting
for some groceries a young lady, evi
dently unused to housekeeping, ap
proached the raw Irish clerk and tim
idly asked: "1 want some mutton to
make broth. Shall I get it off the
neck?" "Xo, ma'am," was the solemn
reply as the clerk pointed to the butch
er busy at his block, "ye git It off that
inon." — Presbyterian.
Crashed.
"I think I never saw Rymer so utter
ly crushed as he was when his first
poem appeared in print"
"What was the matter? Some typo
graphical error in the poem?"
"No, tliat wasn't it. What crushed
him was that the paper was sold for
a penny a copy, Just as usual."
Saxes Him Money.
"Why do you always agree with your
Wife In everything?" she said.
"I find it cheaper to do that than to
quarrel with her and then buy dia
monds to square myself."
Couldn't Spend It.
"Say, Bill, once I had more money
flan I knew What to do with."
"Yer don't mean ltf"
"Sure, i found a quarter In a tenj»
p'vance town."
An Inference.
Clerk— The old man thinks you are
pretty. The Typewriter— Really? ifas
ha gftid so? Clerk— No, but he doesn't
criticise your spelling. — New York
Press.

out of pulse, out of oats, out of bana
nas. The fact is, sir, we make flours
out of everything but wheat. For in
China, sir, we eat no bread, an
therefore the coarse, dry tasteless
flour of wheat is useless to us. "--

There is a Difference.
The difference between Kennedy's
Laxative Honey and Tar and all other
CougU Syrups is that it moves the
bowels, thus expelling a cold trom
the system. This relaxes the nerve
tissues and by its healing effect ou the
throat and lungs the cough is relieved
—cured entirely. Kennedy's is the
original Laxitive Honey and Tar and
contains no opiates. Good alike tor

CAREFUL OF THE FIRE.
the Stingy Hotel Keepers of Spain
and Southern Italy.
In the smaller hotels of southern
Italy and of Spain, writes Mr. Hart
tn "Two Argonauts In Spain," tho un
fortunate tourists slowly froeze. The
landlords display a touching solicit
ude about the stove. On days when
tire is really needed to keep the guests
warm they sometimes spend half thelv
time trying to keep the servants from
putting too much fuel on the fire.
To prevent Americans and other
pyromaniacs from meddling with the
fuel they often keep the coal bin lock
ed. It is a touching spectacle to see a
group of Americans shivering round a
little stove; to see the servant enter,
take out a key, unlock the coal bin,
put two or three spoonfuls of coal in
the stove and then lock the bin again;
to see the gimlet eye of a Granada
landlord fastened on him from the of
fice; then to see the hapless Americans
sink back into their overcoat collars
and wish they were back home.
As an instance of the desperation to
which these cold hotels drive people I
once in a Levantine hotel . saw an
elderly spinster seat herself in front
of the stove in the men's smoking
room, with her hair down, while an
elderly female friend gave her a dry
shampoo.
To the suggestion of the scandalized
servants that she should finish this
intimate toilet operation in her own
room she replied briefly that she had
found the only warm place in the ho
tel and proposed to finish the shampoo
there, which she did.
