The World's Supply of Copper.
The dominating position taken by
the United States among the contribu
tors to tho world's supply of copper
has already been commented on. The
imnense activity of the Americans,
added to their mechauical Kas
led to the initiation by them of a scale
of operations hit Kef o unprecedented
in the history of. mining:. But, if the
ine.rea-iinj? demand for copper con
tinues, present soutves of supply will
soon bo iniuittici«nt, unless production
at'tbb big- mine* can bo still further
stimulated, ft is doubtful, however,
whether tho ptoiluctiun of mines like
t hit Anaconda and the Itio Tint o can
be very lamely inn-eased. And there
is another side to the. question that
must not be lost si;; lit of, tho more rapid -
ly an ore deposit is exploited, tbe sooner
it will bo exhausted. It. is true that
there aro immense reserves of copper
ore at Lake Superior, assuming that
the beds can be ; profitably worked
down to a vortical depth of 6000 to
7000 feet; but it*ayetns likely that even
this source *of supply will fail to cope
with the increased demands of tho
early part of tho next century, and
three or four decades will probably
see it exhausted. | We are bound to as
sume, therefore, that unless new and
abundant sources for tho metal are
o[>ened up in tlie early part of the
next century, or some substitute is
found for it in the electrical industry,
there is no prospect of copper being
over-produced. — The Engineering Mag

IRRIGATION APPROPRIATION
Successful ' Efforts of Our
Congressmen.
A SHORT BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF P. A. BUELL
The Johnstown Water Company Will
Probably Have i heir Land
Be-timbered.
Demands from all over the country
for information as to water supply and
for irrigation investigation and surveys
have been so great that the modest ap
propriation made by last Congress to
the Geological Survey for this purpose
has been exhausted long before the end
of the fiscal year, and such work has
been brought to a standstill. But now,
in one of its gentler moods, Congress
after, considerable' persuasion on | tho
part of the western legislators and
after several attempts to throw it out.
has made a deficiency appropriation of
920,000 to be immediately available for
carrying on this work till Juno 30,
1000.
"I am particularly gratified, " said
Mr. F. H. Newell, tho Hydrographer
of the Geological Survey, and in charge
of irrigation matters, "at this action of
Congress, not so much in allowing the
appropriation, thou<rh wo in-ed that
badly, but in so declaring its temper in
regard to this work,"
Senator Bard introduced the amend
ment and along with Senator Carter
and other western friends of irrigation
in the Senate, urged its adoption.
Senator Perkins, being on the commit
tee having the hill in charge, was in a
position to assist materially. ; In the
House, Congressmen . .\vodham
Kahn worked hard. Anything per
taining to irrigation which is out of the
ordinary, - has a difficult time of it in
getting through the House, . where
western ~ representation is so compara
tively slight.
"This work we are doing, "continued
Mr. Newell, "meets more than a west
ern demand, and it ia a good sign fur
the West that it does. All through
the East there is a demand for water
gauging und stream measurement by
the government, for basing estimates
in erecting manufacturing -plants pro
posing to utilize water power. All this
work which we have been doing in
stream measurement, surveys of reser
voir sites and underground water flows
in tho West has been "stopped for lack
of funds, but I" have now telegraphed
to continue with it and it will go on at
least until the Ist of July."
NATIONAL, IRRIGATION.
Throughout the entire arid region
the plan to construct storage reser
voirs, to be under government, control,
to be used for the storage of flood
waters for irrigation is almost univers
ally endorsed. There is no more im
portant question, now before western
Senators and Representatives than tho
reclamation of tho arid west through
this means, nor no project to which
they could devote themselves with
more profit and upon which they could
combine every force with more certain
and general support from their varied
constituencies. -Will these constituen
cies demand such action on the part of
every representative sent to the na
tional Congress? The question after
all always rests with the . man | who
casts his vote, if he will but keep the
fact In mind.
GAINING HEADWAY.
The action of Congress in appropriat
ing an additional $20,000 for irrigation
investigation - avid reservoir surveys
shows that the national irrigation idea
is at work in that body and will not
down. Each year a little advance is
made along this line as the proposition
becomes better known. In unifying
the West in favor of tbe policy of fed
eral storage, one of the greatest ex
cuses for eastern opposition has been
overcome, for now the entire arid
region speaks as one voice. I
DEFIES THE EAST.
When eastern tnanufactiirers and
whp|esale jabbers have their attention
called to the matter, it i» a very simple
thing for them to see that with the
opening of large areas of fertile western
land, through a policy of national
irrigation, new markets will be opened
for their goods and products. And sq
they become at once favprulik; tp tho
Idea, ' This secures for the West an
active and influential ally in every
eastern State.

BUEU.'S UFE STQRY,
The Lumber King of Stockton Dies In
Ban Francisco.
1 Park ' Arbington Buoll was born at
Richfield, Summit county, Ohio, " on
September 13, 1859. When between
three and four years of age ho moved
to near Napiersville, Illinois, with the
family. When Park was about thirteen
years pf' age. 'his father died, and the
bp'y 'immodtatofy took charge of the
farm, cpnducting it successfully. On
January 9, 1875, the Buells arrived in
Santa Rpsa, Califprnia. He was then
sixteen years p,f age, and be immedi
ately wpnt to. wprk }n the lumber yard
of Koral Brothers, carrying lumber.
He worked for them until 1881, when
he came to Stockton, and almost im
mediately became foreman for White &
Thomas in their planing mill. Shortly
afterwards he went into the planing
mill business for himself, and after
wards in the lumbqr business. In 1885
he burned out. It was a bitter blow to
the young man, but he had grit and
backbone." He soon reestablished him
self, founding the present immense busi
ness by opening a lumber yard and
planing mill pn Center street. The
business continued tp grpw and im
mense stgck pf lumber beiqg carried,
until now it is one of the largest inter
ior establishments of the kind in the
State.
Seventeen years ago the deceased was
married to Miss Ada Moore, who bore
him three children, of whom two,
Henry and Amy, are living. Besides
his own family the deseased leaves two
brothers, Gus A. and Ross J., and a
sister, Mrs. A. W. Ely of Tacoma,
Washington. She has been notified of
the death of her brother, and is expect
ed to arrive in Stockton in a day or
two. The mother of the deceased, Mrs.
A. W. Buell, who formerly lived la
Santa Rosa, is now living in Stockton
with her son "Ross; and has been here
all winter.
For years 1b« ■ deceased had been
prominent in the commercial, political
and social affairs of Stockton, and was
identified ' with all progressive steps
made by the city. '.
Mr. Bufill was President of the San
Joaquin Valley Commercial Associa
tion, the [ organizer of tho Stockton
Chamber of Commerce, and a promi
nent member of the Merchants and
Manufacturer's Association. He was
also a prominent Mason. .. being a
Knights Templar.
P. A. -Buell 's life was insured In the
New York Life-insurance Company for
835,000, which he ha-1 been carrying for
eight or nine years. It is believefj, also,
that he carried a small policy in an
other company. Besides his interest in
the lumber and planing mill which bore
his name, the deceased left the home
place, valued at about $5000. There Is
a mortgage on the property.- Tho ex
tent of Mr. Buell's holdings in mining
enterprises is not known, but outside of
the life insurance policy it is believed
his estate will not net a large euid. —

Beforest Conemaugh Watershed.
The famous Johnstown flood of May
31, 1889, will probably soon be recalled
to the public by an attempt to reforest
a large portion of the Conemaugh
watershed to prevent further damage
from freshets. The Johnstown Water
Company, which controls 5000 acres of
mountain land, has asked the Division
of Forestry to devise a plan by which
the area can be re-covered with timber
and the too rapid run-off of the rainfall
prevented.
The region is peculiarly liable to
freshets, owing to Its' geological char
acter and the removal of its timber.
The now historic catastrophe, which
swept away $10,000,000 in property and
half as many lives as the baitie of
Gettysburg, was but an exaggerated
instance of many similar Hoods. This
tendency has be'en increased by logging
off the lumber and- clearing numerous
farms, so that the rainfall Hows quickly
from the surface, causing high watt-t
at one time and tho drying up of
springs later.
The Johnstown Water Company has
bought up many of these farms and
torn down their buildings, and now
wishes to expodito their return to the
forest. The tract is in a sandstone
region, much broken, with valleys
averaging 350 feet in depth. The tim
ber consists of hemlock, oak, locust
and ash, with some beech and poplar.
The openings are from twenty to fifty
acres.
As soon as the weather permits, J.
W. Tourney, Superintendent of Tree
Planting, and another working-plan
expert of the Division of Forestry, will
examine the region aud decide on a
plan of reforestation. In the clearings,
tree planting will be required. An at
tempt will probably he made to in
crease tbe stand over the whole area
by skillfully assisting natural reproduc
tion. Protection from fire and cattle
will also bo required. The expense
will be shared by the Government and
the Water Company, the former fur
nishing the expert work and, possibly,
some of the material foe planting.

THE OCEAN PEDDLES.
IN CONTRABAND GOODS HE fINDS
GREATEST PROFITS.
Hetnvds of Trading Vessels Tnmt Go
to Many Out of the Way Corners fit
*»•_ World— How the Captain Oiii
■oses of His Cargo.
j The man with a pack on his back,
trudging from village to village and of
fering for sale at cottage and farm
house a miscellaneous collection of
wares, has his counterpart In the ocean
peddler, ranging in size from a schoon
er trading among the Islands of the
Pacific to a steamer of 1,000 to 2,000
tons burden.
The ocean peddler starts out from
Hamburg or San Francisco, the chief
home ports of the trade, with a definite
object In view. Sailing from the for
mer city the course Is generally 'laid
either to the coast of Africa or South
America, having In the hold a varied
a»wjrtment of goods likely to be mar
ketable in the regions visited— cotton
fabrics, trinkets, arms, ammunition,
liquors and all spare room filled up
with coal.
As the largest profits are often de
rived from the sale of contraband
goods, such as munitions of war to in
surgent bodies, and as detection by
regular authorities would lead to' con
fiscation, several thousand rounds of
cartridges are probably done up In in
nocent looking cases stamped "Canned
Beef" and a few stands of discarded
German army rifles In packages label
ed "Glass, \flth Care."
. The captain of such a vessel must
possess not only ability as a navigator,
but an expert knowledge of the re
quirements of his trade in addition to
a plausible tongue wherewith to barter
and win over the good will of an HI
disposed official. If he does not own
an Interest in the ship, It is generally
required that he shall in her cargo.
Trudging along over the ocean at a
seven or eight knot gait saving his
coal as much as possible, the peddler
opens his trade by casting anchor in,
say, a South or Central American port,
when, having squared the comman
dant, he Invites merchants and others
on board to inspect his stock. Duty,
of course, has to be paid by the pur
chaser, but In certain cases that diffi
culty Is often overcome by the visitor
to the ship going ashore swollen out
perhaps to three times his normal size
by as many new suits of clothing.
The greatest good fortune that can
fall hi the way of an ocean peddler is
for an American or British man-of-war
to put Into some out of the way port In
which he Is lying, short of coal. Then
from his spare stock he sells a few
hundred tons at as hard a bargain as
the necessity of the purchaser, permits
him to drive.
On the Central American coast the
peddler usually times his visit at about
the opening of the coffee season— that
Is, early hi the new year — so that when
be has sold out his wares he is able to
load up, almost to the water line, with
the principal export of the country
That the ocean peddling trade is not
without Its dangers Is illustrated by a
story told by a mate of one of those
vessels. In order to preserve his re
spectable character the contraband
goods are sometimes stored In places
likely to escape the vigilant eye of the
customs officer, and in the case in ques
tion the mate's bunk was chosen as
the safest repository for certain pack
ages of dynamite consigned to the lead
ers of a Nicaraguan revolution.
All went well until the night before
the ship was due to arrive at her desti
nation, when a thunderstorm occurred,
the lightning playing about the masts
in an alarming manner. The mate
confessed that the Idea of turning in
upon a bed of dynamite under such
circumstances was not conducive to
peaceful repose even to one accustom
ed to sleep through all manner of dan
gers, but with the reflection that If a
flash found Its way to his bunk he
would not be likely to be made aware
flf the fact he slumbered serenely
through his watch below and next day
delivered the "canned tomatoes" safely
to the consignee.
The ocean peddling trade on tho Pa
cific has been shorn of much of its
profit since the Interlsland passenger
traffic In natives, who too often were
carried as passengers, much against
their will, to dive for pearls on the
great Australian bank, has been ef
fectually suppressed. Still a consider
able trade Is carried on In small ar
ticles of hardware, old clothes, person
al trinkets and an occasional case of
i!dry goods," which, If seized, would
turn out to be remarkably wet— New

Old German Wa«« Lists,

was nothing less than a pictorial and

possibility of making such an error as
to mistake the abbreviation Sh. for
shirts or St. for stockings. She had
pictures of each article and simply

Pool the Bees and the People.
| "People buy comb honey," said a
man from the country, "believing that
the fact that it is sealed by the honest
little' bee • precludes the possibility of
fraud.- The j fact is that the bees of
many professional 'honey' raisers do
nothing the livelong summer but pack
glucose into their hives from an open
barrel that is left standing close | by.
The bee will not search fragrant flow
ers the livelong day for a trifling
amount of pure honey when he can get
glucose. The honey men see that there
is plenty of glucose bandy, and instead
of one pound of pure honey they aid
the bees in putting ten pounds of glu
cose on the market. -
"Human Ingenuity has not devised a
way for making and sealtng the honey
comb, or the bee would be dispensed
with altogether.. In handling the glu
cose the bees give it a honeyish flavor,
and if you complain to the bee man
that it is not as sweet and sticky as it
should be he will tell you that It is the
early crop and that the heavy rains
make it thin.
"I know a man who keeps 60 hives
of bees on the roof of his store in the
city, and by. hustling up plenty of glu
cose he gets enough 'honey* out of the
buzzing slaves to do a wholesale busi
ness in honey. Why, his bees never
saw a flower and would shy at a hon
eysuckle if they happened to come near
one. He will not even let the poor
things have a recess to get a drink of
water, but keeps a pan qf fresh water
near the hives for them to drink."—

An Immortal Oration.
The funeral oratiou of Pericles Is
pretty nearly what was actually spo
ken, or else it is the substance of the
speech written out In the historian's
own words, says James Ford Rhodes
in The Atlantic. Its intensity of feel
ing and the fitting of it so well Into the
situation Indicate it to be a living con
temporaneous document, and at ! the
same time it has that universal appli
cation which we i note in so many
speeches of Shakespeare.
A few years after our civil j war a
lawyer in a city of the middle west
who had been selected . to deliver the
Memorial day oration came to a friend
of his in despair because he could write
nothing but the commonplaces about
those who had died for tbe Union and
for the freedom of a race which had
been uttered many times before, and
he asked for advice.
"Take the funeral oration of Pericles
for a model," was the reply. "Use his
words where they will fit and dress up
the rest to suit our day."
The orator was surprised to find how
much of the oration could be used bod
ily and how much, with adaptation,
was germane to his subject
Averted the Storm.
A certain congressman went home at
a very early hour In the morning. He
bad made a night of it with some
friends. He knew that his conduct
would be considered reprehensible by
his better half, and so, as he ascended
the steps of his modest home, he rack
ed his brain for some plan to avert the
lady's wrath. As he entered the hall
he saw an umbrella. Instantly it oc
curred to him that the umbrella might
be his salvation.
He carried the umbrella up stairs.
Seating himself on a chair in the cor
ner of the bedroom, he raised the rain
guard over his head, and then he
coughed loudly. His wife awoke and
saw in the dim gaslight her liege lord
sitting solemnly under the raised um
brella.
"What are you doing?" she asked in
natural surprise.
"It Is 3 o'clock, nay dear," said he,
"and I am waiting for the storm."
tthe congressman's ready wit saved
him from a Caudle lecture. He is wor
rying now, however, to find an equally
effective act for the next time he stays

Average Time of a Wink.
"In a twinkling of an eye" Is a
phrase for brevity, but M. Garten in
"The Archives de Pfluger" has found
the average time of a wing to be about
40 of a second. The eyejid descends In
about . .80 of a second, stays down
about .13 of a second to .17 of a second
and rises again In about .17 of a sec
ond. Winking varies much In different
persons and rarely occurs when the at
tention Is concentrated, but this omis
sion is followed by a series of winks to
make up, either by resting the eye or
cleaning \%,

In 1827, Just after Dan Dougherty,
the Irish pugilist,' fought his famous
fight with Jem Belcher, the English
fighter, on the curragh of Kildare, near 1
Dublin, he became involved In a con
troversy with an unknown. The lat
ter was not a pugilist and, not wishing
to take any advantage of his opponent
Dougherty consented to fight him with
pistols. The two met by appointment,
but their seconds, unknown to them,
extracted the balls from the pistols
and substituted blank cartridges. By
the terms of the agreement between
the principals Dougherty's opponent
was to have the first shot The natu
ral Instinct prevailed even on the duel

elevated his right arm, as If to ward

E. T. CHAMBERLAIN'S REPORT
United States Commissioner
NO DUTr ON MATERIAL FOR SPECIFIED VESSELS
Over fifty Per Cent, of the Amount
Paid for a Finished Ship Goes
■ to Shipyard Labor.
There is a very general impression in
certain parts of the country that if the
materials used in shipbuilding wore ad
mitted free of duty our shipbuilders
would he ablo to build ships as cheaply
in the United States as they can be
built in foreign countries. Compara
tively few people know that such ma
terials have for years been on our freo
list. Many think that American ship
builders are compelled to patronize
home steel producers, and that they
are com polled to buy of these manu
facturers, no matter what prices they
demand.
Commissioner of Navigation E. T.
Chamberlain, of the Treasury Depart
ment, who is constantly administering
the laws relating to merchant vessels
of the United Stales, referring to the
misapprehension of our laws for free
raw material for shipbuilding, said:
. '•Congress inaugurated the policy of
admitting free of duty materials in
tended for the foreign trade, and for
the trades between the Atlantic and
Pacific ports of the United States, as
long ago as 1872, althongh at that
time it was not so broad in its scope as
at present. Section 10 of the act of
June 6, 1872, is the first bearing on this
point, and it exempts 'all lumber, tim
ber, hemp, manila, and iron and steel
rods, bars, spikes, nails and bolts, and
copper and composition metals,' which
may be necessary for the construction
of vessels in the trades named, from
any duties. The same articles, if in
tended for vessels in those trades,
needing repairs, are also, by that act.
admitted free of duty.
"By section 5 of the act of February
8, 1875, yellow sheathing metal and
yellow metal bolts, of which the com
ponent part of chief value is copper,
were added to tho free list in respoct of
ships building or repairing for the
trades named. The tariff act of March
3, 1883, section 2510, added wire rope
to the articles previously exempted,
and in that section included ail the
other materials previously exempted.
Section Bof the McKinley tariff of Oc
tober 1, 1900, also added 'plates, tees,
angles, and beams;' that is to say,
practically all structural forms of iron
and steel destined for ships to be built
or repaired for the trades specified
"Sections 7 and 8 of the tariff act of
August 15, 1894 put everything on the
freo list neoded for tho construction or
repair of such ships by providing that
'all materials of foreign production
which may be necessary for tho con
struction of vessels built in tho United
States for foreign account and owner
ship or for tho purpose of being em
ployed in the foreign trade, including
tho trade between the Atlantic and
Pacific ports of the United States, and
all such materials necessary for the
building of their machinery, and all
articles necessary for their outfit and
equipment, ' were exempted thereafter
from' duty.
"It Is clear that to the extent that
the free importation of foreign mater
terials can be of aid to our people in
the building of ships for the foreign
trade, they have for some years had
tho benefit of such laws.
"Vessels engaged in tho trades I
have named are entitled under our law
of June 3d, 1881, to Import, free of
duty, any supplies required for use on
board such vessels, by the provisions
of section 16 of tho tariff act of July 24,
1 8D7, and in the same act section 415 ex
empts fuel coal imported for the use qf
vessels in the trades namod from all
duties," •
A citation of the foregoing acts, ver
ification of which may be had by any
one- having access to the laws of the
United States, ought to put an end to
the demand for the free importa
tion of all materials intended for
tho construction of vessel building
or repairing for ; the foreign trade.
It will be interesting, here, to tabu
late these several acts, setting opposite
to their djites the amount of shipping
under the American flag In the foreign
trade at the tiino of the passage of
each, also showing the proportion .of
our foreign carrying done by such ships
at thoso dates, and which, compiled
from official sources, makes the follow
ing showing: • .
American tonnage Percentage of
[Date of J registered for carrying in
Act foreign trade. American vessels.
1872 .1,410,618 39.2
1875 1,553,827 26,2
1883 1,302,095 J6
1890 646,605 12.9
1894 916,180 . • 13.3
1897........ 805,584 11
Clearly, the exemption of imported
materials from duties, when intended
for the construction or repair of vessels
for tho foreign trade, has not hud the
effect of checking the steady decline of
our shipping in that trade, much less
of helping to rehabilitate the Amer
ican merchant marine. American
shipbuilders say that the difference \a
♦•he cost of building vessels in the

f A remarkable experiment was made
recently at the latarator s of Thomas A.'
Edison, when a^piece of iron waV melted
inifivelaeconds.*,, LouiS* Dreyfus 'of
Frankfort on the Main, who is the
agent of the Goldschmidt's Chemische
Thermo Industrie of Es9en, Germany,
showed Edison this process for attaining
great heat in an almost increditably
short time by the combustion of a cer-'
tain chemical compound,- which the in
ventor keeps secret, used when in con
nection with powderd aluminum.
Dreyfus placed half a cupful of the
chemical in a crucible covered it with a
small quantity of powdered aluminum
and then placed a wrench about half an
inch thick and six inches long with it.
Touching a match to the compound,
Dreyfus stepped back and the mixture
blazed up furiously. In live seconds the
wrench was melted." It Is estimated
that the heat evolved in the process was
3000 degrees centigrade, hitherto con
sidered impossible to reach. The value
of the process w expected to be shown

Always on hand,HAS EXCELLENT CLEANUPS
Good Returns From Central
Eureka Rock.
SOLID WALL OF COPPER IN GAMPO SEGO MINES
Providence Hill Has Suspended Oper
. ations.— The Larkin Mine En
gine Broken Down.
Central Eureka.— Butter Creek.
The Central Eureka mine is now
down to a depth of 1675 feet, and dur
ing this prospect i work over $52,000 in
gold has been obtained, tho last crush
ing at the Zoila mill producing $12,235.
Nostoping has been done as yet but Su
perintendent Thomas intends to begin
sloping in a short time. There are three
distinct leads in tho mine, one of them
producing rock that averages about
$80 and the others from $8 to $20. The
material for the mill is being placed on
the ground as fast as possible. To get
the mine into first-class dividend pay
ing condition an expenditure including'
cost of mill, of about $40,000 will be
necessary, all of which Superintendent
Thomas will take out of the mine,
doubtless, as the work progresses; ■
Kirkwood.— Jackson.
The Kirkwood Mining Company has
already sold about 30,000 shares of
stock, but no assessments will be made
on stock until the- full 100,000 shares
shall have been sold, the promoters
keeping up the preliminary expenses
themselves. Few mining enterprises
have started out more favorably than
the Kirkwood.
Peerless.— Jackson.
The Peerless shaft is down about 170
feet, ! and the latest report from Su
perintendent Osborne this week indi
cated an improved condition in the ap
pearance of the ledge matter. Con
stant inquiry for the stock is made,
both here and in San Francisco, but
there appears to be none for sale.
- The shaft has again encountered the
black slate in the hanging wall, which
is highly mixed with quartz carrying a
large percentage of sulphurets. The
slate is of the right character, being
very black and smooth and will com
pare favorably with any black slate on
the Mother Lode. The prospects are,
indeed, encouraging.
Lincoln— Sutter Creek.
J Good reports continue to come from
the Lincoln mine, and thoso interested
feel confident of the outcome : and gov
ern themselves accordingly by holding
on to their stock. '
1 Kennedy— Jackson-
At the Kennedy mine crosscutting in
the north shaft is being done, and very
hard rock is encountered. The new
east shaft is down nearly 1300 feet; and
notwithstanding very hard : rock an
excellent average is being made. - The
mill is dropping forty stamps as usual.
Argonaut— Jackson.
.Nothing new at this producer. ; -The
mill is running as usual and the work
in the mine advances as heretofore, so
far as we are advised.
Fremont-Gover— Amador.
Development work at Jthe Fremoat-
Gover mine is progressing. The shaft
is down about 300 feet. Additional fa
cilities for handling the water are to be
added to the outfit in the near future..
Banker Hill.
.Work at the Bunker HilKmlne. is
I progressing and the prospects are ex
cellent. Some fine rock was ireeently
: encountered in : the tunnel, a specimen
of which assayed over $100. •
Sheep Eanch.— Calaveras.
' From all accounts the future of this
historical producer is going to rival its
old-time ■ excellence. State Expert
-Storms recently made a careful inspec
tion of the Sheep Ranch mine, and in a
conversation with a Ledger repre
sentative a few days since, expressed
himself substantially as follows: . In
~my judgment, said Mr. Storms," the
Sheep Ranch mine is capable of pro
ducing as much wealth as it ever has.
There is every indication of a largo ore
body still untouched, and the rock is
equal in value to any heretofore taken
out of the mine. The present shaft
will be sunk deeper, and later a new
shaft will probably be sunk from 2000
to 3000 feet deep, some distance south
of the present shaft, say a matter of
1500 feet or so. All of the work re
cently done at the mine is first-class in
every respect, and the mill is one of
the finest of its size in the country. Mr.
Storms closed his remarks by saying
that he saw no reason why the Sheep
Ranch mine should not, if judiciously
managed, pay dividends to its stock
holders for many years to come.'
CALAVERAS COUNTY.
Prospect: The Gold Hill mine at
Smith's Flat is showing signs of re
newed activity. This once famous
property, then known as the Osbo'rne
mine, is doubtless soon again to add to
to its bullion producing record. It has
given up many thousands of dollars in
the past and there is no doubt but that
many more thousands are concealed in
iteldepths. |
The mortgagas on the property have
been recently paid off, and the work of
grading for a new hoist has been com
menced. The new shaft is on the
north side of the tunnel and will prob
ably be sunk to a good depth. ' A fifty
horse-power engine and two fifty-hQr.se
power boilers are now on their way to
the mine. There is a Chicago; com
pany behind the work, with Mr. Wolf
as superintendent, and a thoroughly
competent foreman in direct charge of
tl]o "men. At present some ten or
twelve men are employed, with a pros
pect of increasing* the force shortly.
The San Domingo mine, at Dogtown,
has had a new derrick of the latest
pattern made at the Angels foundry.
The d.-rick U 101 feet high, with a
swinging boom ninety-nine feet in
length- iTho ma-i is twenty-six inches
squatv .- : - ibe baij and twelve inches at
the ton and is calculated to lift ten tons
of rock. It is now being: placed in posi
tion on the ijiine by O.'-B. Gozzolo.
Thel foundry is also getting out two
j)OwCrfuli. derricks ;.'■ for IC D. Lane,
which will be shipped to Cape Nome;
also some lnrge # water skips for the
same place.
There is talk that operations will
soon be resumed on: this mine, located
about two miles north of the famous
Gwin. -The old tunnel j has been clean
ed out and the property will be thor
oughly examined by competent parties.
If the examination proves satisfactory
work will probably be commenced' at
once:
In the early days, Carson Hill and its
immediate vicinity was one of tho rich
est mining fields intheState, and many
and wonderful are the talcs that arc
told of huge nuggets and rich veins
and .pockets .of that famous district.
Mrs. J. C. Tarbat is one of the old set
tlers of that place, having been reared
there from a child, and she woll re
members these old stories of rich dis
coveries. She is now tho owner of the
Finnigan mine at Carson, and can rec
ollect, how her . father in those days
took some big' pockets from this very
ground, often taking- out from 81500 to
$2000 in a very short time. Recently
her son James Tarbat, and a Mr. Har
ris while prospecting on the mine, took
out a pocket of $900, the largest nugget
weighing $60. This is a pretty good
find for these days.
The Santa Ana mine at Carson will
reopen about the middle of the month.
Mr. Stedman, the superintendent, is
daily expected here.
The Ophir mine of thus place, owned
by J. Canepa, has been bonded to W.
V. Miller. Work is to be begun at
once. .
The famous old Greek mine which
has been idle of late is likely to resume
operations again on a more extensive
scale. On Monday of this week the
work of pumping out the old works
was begun, and as soon as the water is
out we may look for good news from
this section. It is said that D. Gut
mann of. the. Sheep Ranch and Ford
minea, is to operate this property, and
if it is so his^ well-know. _ reputation for
energy and' push' is a sure guarantee
that the qualities of the mine will soon
be known.*,? *f ;t . .
Citizen: ; Things at ..the Sheep mine
are progressing iv a favorable manner,
and a large amount of work is being
done. Additional men are being con
stantly put to work.
The shaft of the Lodi mine at Sheep
ranch, is 'still going ' down, and the
prospects are good. \ ( '. ! l
The big copper mines at Campo Seco
are showing up splendidly at the pres
ent time and the owners are highly
pleased with the solid wall of metal
they have struck, and while it is im
possible to tell just how far it extends
the indications are I that it is an im
mense ledge. Enough gold and silver
is being taken out to meet the expenses
of operating the claim. .and the copper
produced is-iiherefore a clear profit.
The running expenses amount to about
$5000 a month. Tunnels are being run
and the mine is being, extensively tim
bered. An electric light system is used
and improved methods are employed
in the operation of these claims which
have not been .worked" regularly until
within the past few months. {
The big vein at the Commodore is
holding out and does not diminish in
width at all. -Its extent is unknown
for as drifting and crosscutting pro
gresses it remains' the ' same,' and it is
the opinion of those who are in position
to know that the Commodore is des
tined to be. one 'of - : the biggest mining
propositions in this section of the
country." The rock being taken out is
pronounced rich by miners, and a mill
run is soon to be made to determine its
exact valued after which, should satis
factory results "be shown, a mill will be
immediately erected. ■ . • '.
':. Chronicle:., The -report is . current
that the .Lock wood and Blazing Star
mines wilt be started in the near future.
These were two . of the best properties
in that district and - the news is very
gratifying to residents" of this end of
the county. It is also stated that the
Keystone at Railroad Flat will resume
operations shortly, Colonel Loftus who
has' the property' in hand, having
passed through this town last Monday
oh route to the mine. There is a ten
stamp mill along with all the' other ne
cessary appurtenances on this mine, so
when the word is given it will not be
long before work will be under way.

SNOW'S PARTY AT SEATTLE
Dr. Gibbons Writes the Led-
ger of the Trip.
AMADORCITY, GRAND VIEW, CANYON, PLYMOUTH
Son of M. Butler of Plymouth, Takes
a Pistol to School and Receives
a Bullet In His Hand.
LETTER FROM DR. GIBBONS-
Seattle, Wash.; April 3, 1900.
Dear; Ledger:
■rSince bidding goodby to Jackson
and the friends iv holds, wo have seen a
panorama both varied and interesting.
The ride to Latrobe Thursday morning
was a pleasant beginning, and the race
of a milo that Mr.' Aviso made to catch
the 8 o'clock train was a sensation and
a success, j Reaching Sacramento at
9:20 and Woodland at 11, gave time to
attend to some business, affairs and
havc^'a pleasant visit. with old friends
untiV the 4 o'clock train came along,
and at 8 wo were in. San Francisco.
Not having slept any for forty-two
hours and' very little for four days, I
had no inclination for anything but rest,
so I went to the Turkish bath?, spent
nearly. two hours in the hot room and
steam (tank, where the temperature is
from 150° to 170°, then, after the scrub
bing and massage and a plunge in the
swimming tank, wrapped the Turkish
robe about me and enjoyed a delicious,
dreamless ,. twelve hours' sleep, .and
awoke feeling like an entirely new man.
Friday was spent in making prepar
ations, and Saturday morning at 7
o'clock we started for the far north via
the Shasta Route of the Southern Pa
cific.' A number of Mr. Snow's theat
rical friends were at the ferry to see
him off. With the company he had
engaged to play with him the coming
season, we nearly filled a Pullman coach.
This is the most pleasant season of
the year to make the trip. The wheat
fields, orchards and vineyards of Sol
ano, Yolo and Colusa give promise of
coming abundance. At noon we
reached Arbuckle, our old home, where
Maud joined us, and a hearty hand
shake was given by a 'crowd of old
friends. The region looked familiar,
but it was saddening, to see an entire
absence of progress or improvement.
No new paint or even whitewash. The
population of this region is less than it
was fifteen years ago. The whole
country is a wheat field, except a few
orchards and vineyards, and constant
planting of the same crop -has reduced
the yield fully one half. At Willows we
crossed the unfinished, weed filled irri
gation ditch, a monument to the folly
of the "kickers" who spent more
money to prevent the completion of the
ditch than it would have cost to finish
it. Now. they see their mistake, when
it is too late.
At Corning we saw the thriftiest part
of northern California. Large tracts
of land have been subdivided and
sold in small pieces to settlers. Hun
dreds of little cottages show. where new
homes have been made and the land is
being planted with fruit trees and vines.
Red Bluff and Redding show improve
ment and prosperity. At Redding the
tillable land . of the Valley stops, and
only a ravine remains along which for
about 100 miles the train climbs, cross
ing the river sixteen times and thread
ing a dozen tunnels, showing beautiful
bits of scenery atevery turn. Darkness
shut off the best of the views, but we
remained up to see the ghostly outlines
of Castle Crag and enjoy the magnifi
cent,' though indistinct, view of Shasta,
standing like the Queen of Night with
her robe of starchy whiteness reaching
to her very feet. When we awoke Sun
day morning we had crossed the Siski
you and the train was climbing up and
rattling down the rugged hills of south
ern Oregon. Running down the Willa
mette Valley, filled with rich fields and
well kept homes, we reached Portland
at dark and remained in the metropolis
of Oregon until Monday noon. The
Northern Pacific Railroad brought us
across the State of Washington and
landed us In Seattle in time for supper
Monday night.
With due credit to California, it is
but fair to say that California is far be
hind the North West in "hustle."
The train from Portland yesterday had
twelve- cars all filled and runs two trains
each, way daily. "The day coaches
carry sixty people each. I counted in
the paper seventeen ads of ships going
to Alaska. Everybody seems to be on
tho; jump hore. : Seattle has four rail
roads instead of one. Everybody is wild
about Alaska and from one to four
steamers or sailing vessels leave for the
north every day. * ' .-"■. -"■
But I fear of tiring your patience. J
■-We leave for Juneau at 8 o'clock tor
night. ; Yours as ever, .'-

L. M. Parker, William Tarn,
J. W. Caldwell. N. T. Littefield,
Hon. John F.Davis, . Q J: (At-large.)
The club then proceeded to elect ten

Attends the Directors' Meeting.
Superintendent W. H. Thomas of
the well-known Central Eureka mine,'
Sutter Creek, went Jo San Francisco
Wednesday and will attend the stock
holders meeting to be held there to
morrow (Saturday). Mr. Thomas has
carried forward the work of the Cen
tral Eureka in a manner reflecting
great credit on himself and to the en
tire satisfaction of all concerned. That
this mine is destined to become a great
dividend payer is the openly expressed
opinion of many of the most prominent
mine owners in this section. Mr.
Thomas is a conscientious mining man
and very conservative in his state
ments and estimates, but it is our
opinion that he has the fullest confi
dence in tho mine and expects to see it
developed into a gold producer second
to none hereabouts.
Lady Minstrels.
At Webb Hall, Friday evening, April
27, 1900, by Ursula Parlor, N. D. G. W.,
will be given decidedly the event of the
season. Thirty members of the Par
lor, all artists in their respectivefroles,
have formed a minstrel troupe, and
the people of Jackson and vicinity will
be treated to as jolly an entertainment
as they over witnessed. This enter
tainment is given for the benefit of the
Grand Parlor Entertainment Fund,
and the hall should be, and no doubt
will be, packed to the doors. There
will be fancy dances, laughable sketches,
brilliant local hits, colloquial scintilla
tions, comic songs, and in short a thor
oughly up-to-date minstrel perform
ance and no discount. If you miss it
you'll regret it. Don't miss it. :

Ex-District Attorney E. A. Freeman
carried off the honors at the late meet

in San Francisco, by being elected
Grand Overseer in spite of the fact
that there were four candidates, includ
ing himself, for the high office. There
were 353 votes cast and Mr, Freeman

entire community. Mr. Freeman is to
be heartily congratulated on his signal
success.

One of the "Talks With Napoleon"
juoted from Dr. O'Meara's diary ln
The Century records Napoleon's indig
nation ■at being, as he considered It,
spied upon while living at St Helena.
"I understand," said he, "that an
officer Is placed here to report about
me and to see me two or three times
In the 24 hours and that they are talk-
Ing of making him go into my chamber
to sre me If I did not come out. Any
person," said he then, with considera
ble agitation, "who endeavors to force
his way Into my apartment will be a
corpse the moment he enters It If he
ever eats bread or meat afterward, I
im not Napoleon. This I am deter
mined on.
"I know that I will be killed after
ward, as what can one do against a
camp? But what of that? -I have
faced death many a time. Besides I
am convinced that this governor, this
chief of jailers, has been sent out on
purpose to poison me or put me to
death some way or another or under
some pretext by Lord Castlereagh.
"I have seen," continued he, "Rus
sians, Prussians, Arabs, Cossacks,
Tartars, Spaniards, Persians, Turks"
(here he enumerated a great many
more), "and never in my life before
did I. behold so ill favored and forbid
ding a countenance or so down and
horrid a look. He carries crime I Im

The Rose by 'Which One Young Han's
Credit Was Established.
Major J. M. Burke told a good story
of his experience In helping a friend to
"'get the girl of his choice.
"He was a good fellow," said he,
"but young and without much capital.
The girl was a beauty and loved the
boy, but the father (the same old irate
father) j objected and demanded that
the boy show that he was capable 1 of
supporting a wife. This was in St.
Louis about ten years ago, and the boy
came to me with his troubles.
" 'Never mind,' said I. 'I'll fix it up
all right By the way, how much will
: you take for your right leg?*
"He looked at me as though I were
crazy, but made "ho answer.
" 'I'll give you $10,000 for it,' I said.
"Will you take it? . . •
".'No, I won't,' he said. ' 'What do
you take me for?" -
"Well, I knew the girl's father; he
was a and I called to see
him. . We finally drifted around to
talking about this young fellow, and
the old man flared a little, stating that
he wanted some one who could support
a wife to have his daughter.
" 'Support a wife!' said I, in surprise.
'Why, he. certainly can do all that
Only a few days ago he refused $10,

The Height of Storms.
Professor F. H. Bigelow furnishes
The American Journal of Science with
some of the results of the International
cloud work for the United States. The
penetration of ordinary cyclones into
the higher regions of the atmosphere
is slight. They are only two or three
miles deep.' Hurricanes are five or six
miles deep. The antlcyclonic and cy
clonic areas are hardly to be consider
ed as centers of motion except in the
very lowest strata, since currents of
air blow directly over them from west
to east, even in the cumulus region of
the Rocky mountain districts. The or
dinary circulation theory does not hold
good. . In each stratum from the sur
face to the cirrus level about as much
air moves north as south, for there are
enprmous counter currents passing by
each other at the same level and not
over one another at different eleva
tions. This puts a new aspect upon
the entire problem of the general cir
culation.—Nature.
Two Answers.
I Not long ago a Boston clergyman re
ceived an evening call from an elderly
man and woman who expressed a wish
to be joined in the bonds of matrimony
then and there.
"Have you ever been married be
fore?" asked the clergyman of the
man, an honest eyed, weather beaten
person of seafaring aspect
"Never, and never wanted to be be
fore," was the prompt reply.
"And have you ever been married be
fore?" the question came to the wo
man.
"No, sir," she .replied with equal
promptness, and with a touch of hu
mor that appealed to the clergyman at
once she added, "I never bad a
chance!"
The marriage ceremony was speedily
performed, and the clergyman refused
tovtake any fee, telling the bride with
a twinkle in his eye that It bad been a
privilege to officiate which he would
have been sorry to miss. — Youth's

Odd Albanian Customs.
An Albanian woman expects to be
beaten if she misbehaves, this being
the prerogative of an Albanian hus
band. He must be careful, however,
not to draw blood during tbe castiga
tlon, or the wife can complain to the
authorities, who will fine the husband
and give his property to his wife.
When an Albanian marries, he is
bound to provide his wife with food,
clothes and a home ln keeping with his
station and means and cannot require
ber to earn money for herself or him
by her labor.
. Divorce is quite common. Excessive
corpulence on the part of the husband
Is considered quite sufficient excuse for
the •wife to divorce him.
What He Prayed For.
,A story is told of two worthy New

peared before his enemy and solemnly
said:
"Brother Jones, it is a shame that
this quarrel of ours should bring scan
dal upon the church. I have prayed
earnestly^, for guidance In the matter
and have come to the conclusion that
you must give In. for I cannot!"
WELL DRESSED MEN.
ORDER OF THE CITIES IN WHICH
THEY MOST ABOUND.
An Expert Sara Denver Head* tbe
Uat, With San Francisco Second,
Chicago Third, Washington Fourth,
and Xevr York Trails Along Fifth.
"I'd probably be discharged, mobbed
and have all sorts of things happen to
me if I said this over in the big town,
but I can name you at least four Amer
ican cities the men of which are bet
ter dressed year in and year out than
the men of New York," said a man
who travels for a New York merchant
tailor's supply house and whose terri
tory is the whole continent I "I'll name
them in tbe order of their standing as
communities inhabited by the best
dressed men: Denver, San Francisco,
Chicago and Washington. How do I
figure it? Just according to the rule
of sight, that's all. I don't profess to
know much about Egyptology, but I do
know a well dressed man when I see
him.
"Mind, I don't say that all of the
men of those four cities are better
dressed than all of the men of New
York, but I do maintain and say any
Impartial man who knows the four
towns mentioned as they are now will
uphold me in maintaining that ln ratio
to their respective populations the men
of Denver, San Francisco, Chicago and
Washington are very much better
dressed than are the men of New York.
Of course this has been the case only
ln very recent years. New York was
until, say, five years ago away ahead
of all Its rivals as a city of the best
dressed men. At that time if you want
ed to see hundreds of perfectly dress
ed and perfectly groomed men engag
ed in doing business all you had to do
was to take an elevated train up town
in the neighborhood of 10 o'clock in the
morning and watch the men, young,
middle aged and old, who boarded the
train for the down town financial dis
trict
"Of course you'll still see slews of
thoroughly got up men down in the
financial district of New York, but not
so many by 75' per cent as formerly.
On show occasions, such as Easter
Sunday afternoon, New York will still
V3T" out a finely clad batch of men, but
TnT not talking about show occasions
vow. I'm talking about men who are
well clad year in and year out, and It
is in this respect that New York has
fallen into the 'also ran' list.
"When you meet up town In New
York a genuinely swagger man— not a
flashily dressed man, but one who is
thoroughly and properly rigged out
from his hat to his shoes — you are lia
ble to turn around to get a rear view
of him, and then the fact is liable to
be slowly borne In upon you that he Is
some member of a theatrical profes
sion whom you have seen upon the
stage. There are stlll.plenty of flashi
ly dressed men circulating around New
York, but a flashily dressed man never
will be a well dressed man.
"The reason why the men of Denver
are such a well dressed lot isn't entire
ly clear to me. It can't be especially
because there are so many well off men
in that town, because there are myri
ads of well off men in New York.
Maybe it is because, in proportion to
the population, there are probably
more men with large incomes In Den
ver than ln any city on the continent,
not excepting Helena, that used to
bear that distinction. You scarcely
ever see a badly dressed or an over
dressed man ln Denver. Shabby men
there are ln plenty, of course, but I
don't call a shabby man a badly dress
ed man. A badly dressed man is one
who, while having plenty of means to
equip himself with a good make up,
hasn't the taste to do it and therefore
makes his appearance as a slouch—
that's the word for It— slouch. A shab
by man is simply a man who in on bis
uppers and makes no pretensions.
"The clerks and other men of very
moderate incomes in Denver, men who
can't afford to 'keep in the push' as far
as correct dressing goes, don't make
any effort whatever to tog themselves
out in cheap, dismal imitation of the
men with plenty of money; but, like
the young woman in the song, 'they al
ways dress in black.' The business
men who run plants of their own, how
ever, seem to pay just as much atten
tion to the job of getting themselves
ready for business on weekday morn
ings as they do to the task of arraying
themselves for social functions or
evening appearances.
"Easterners who have gone out to
the coast have often commented upon
the swellness of the average well fixed
Sail Francisco man in the matter of
clothes.- The San Francisco man witli
an income certainly gets himself up
'proper,' as we say, and he's got the
right kind of a make up for every oc
casion. Take the race tracks around
San Francisco, for example. Every
man who goes to the races out there
goes ln a regular racing rig, from pad
dock coat to fieldglass and from the
top of his flat crowned derby to the
soles of his 'downs' boots, and so do
the Frisco women, for the matter of
that. Another thins, I'll venture to
assert that nine out of ten men in San
Francisco whose incomes are $2,000 a
year or over rig out in evening clothes
every night In the year, summer in
cluded. A great many more men of
moderate Incomes in Washington don
evening clothes than men of similar in
comes In New York. The men of
Washington dress with singular neat
ness, many with notable elegance. The
excellence of the Washington average,
I suppose, Is to be accounted for by the
absence of a large laboring class here."

is worn by the water as smooth as
though chiseled by the skillful hand
of a stonemason. The arch on top Is
nearly, If not quite, 400 feet in width,
1,000 feet in length across tbe canyon

MINING CAMP TRICKS.
One Instance Where v. Scheme Work-
Ed the Wrong Way.
"There 1r a great deal that is out of
tbe ordinary, ln mining," said Samuel
Mott.of Boise City, Ida., "although I
think from personal experience it is
probably more so in the relation than
In the actual happening. In every
mining camp I have known there
have always been charges that those
n-orking a vein had gone through into
the next claim ln ttking out the ore,
and consequently ' were taking out
what wasn't theirs. These claims it
was always difficult to substantiate,
for the reason that the offender, of
sourse, would not allow the offended to
enter his workings, and without a sur
rey it would be Impossible to make out
a case. Every subterfuge and excuse
possible was resorted to to get Into a
luspected mine.
"I. remember one case in an apex of
a vein suit where the workings had
been temporarily shut down and a man
called 'Johnny Come Lately,' heavily
armed, was on guard. Tbe other side
had tried again and again to get by
'Johnny,' but had always failed, when
one man, who knew that 'Johnny' was
an enthusiastic hunter, faired an ac
quaintance of his to stroll by with a
gun over his arm and to engage 'John
ny' ln a conversation about 'bar.'. It
worked to a chavm, and while be was
thus engrossed they managed to slip
in and survey the mine.
. "Then there was the case of the
Last Chance against the Tyler. In this
case the workings happened to run to
gether, and the Last Chance people
were working the same vein from un
derneath that the Tyler owners were
working from on top. Knowing they
would sooner or later break through,
the Tyler people prepared smudge
that Is, saturated cordwood that would
give forth a tremendous smoke— which,
they hoped, would drive the Last
Chance people out of their mine. But
when they finally set it off It went the
otIKT way and made the Tyler work
ings absolutely untenable. Indeed three
of the miners were overcome and were
rescued only with great difficulty."—

WOULDN'T INTRODUCE HIM-
The Young Woman Rather Thought

and a nice new neaktle entered a law

comes now. That's him going into his
private office."
"Excuse me, but that's not him."
"No? Pray, who is it then?"
"It's he."
They stared at each for ten
seconds, and then the young man said:
"Will you Introduce me to Mr. Young
er?"
"No!" she retorted. "Since you seem
to know so much more about him than
I do, I think you'd better introduce
me."
There was an ominous click in the
rattle of the typewriter as the young
man entered the private office and pre
sented bis card. — Chicago Chronicle.
Mint Hark Collections.
The mint mark collection is the lat
est thing in the line of numismatics.
It is the fad of the specialist and has
little attraction for the amateur. The
object Is to secure complete sets of per
fect specimens of all the coins Issued
from the different mints.
A great many people are scarcely
aware that there Is any way to dis
tinguish the coins Issued from the dif
ferent mints. They may not have no
ticed the small "S" or "CC" beneath
the eagle or under the wreath, and
showing that the piece was coined at
San Francisco or Carson City, or If it
bears an "O" at New Orleans. And
they may or may not know that If It
has no mint mark it comes from the
"mother mint" at Philadelphia. But
the mint mark collector will see these
little letters In an Instant and is very
apt to know just how . many " dimes,
quarters, dollars or half dollars were
turned out at any of the mints during
any year since 1704.— Minneapolis Jour
nal.
A Cat's Long Jump.
How far can a cat jump without
hurting itself was partly exemplified
in Brooklyn the other night A pretty
white cat ran up a tree to get away
from a dog and at last crawled out on
a small branch at least CO feet above
the ground. The branch was not much
more than a twig, and the cat could
not turn around. She sat up there
on the swaying limb and meowed. At
last the twig broke, and down came
the cat She alighted on the ground
on her feet, looked around for a mo
ment and then bounded away; which
shows that a GO foot drop does not hurt
a Brooklyn cat, whatever it might do
to cats of other places.— Pittsburg Dis
patch.

Doubfed Him Vp,
A prominent western clergyman, W.
W. White by name, was a member of
a leArned society in which there were
several members whQ were fond of
quibbling. During a speecli he ha<|
been annoyed by their interruptions al
most beyond the point of endurance.
At last he said, "I trust I will not be
troubled again until my speech |s flul
ished."
Before he could begin another sen
tence on.c of his chief tormentors arose
and said, slowly and solemnly:
"Oh, doctor douliUvu, Aouljleu, double-n,
We love to trouble you, tronbjs you, trpabJA

Interest In* Character! (ties of Lob-
sters and Turtles.
Lobsters, when young and frivolous,
change their shells several times a
year, but as they grow older and, pre
sumably, more sedate they are content
with a new suit every summer. The
lobster is his own tailor, and persons
who have watched the process say
that the difficulty seems to lie in get
ting rid of the old garb and not in flt
tlng.the'new. First he Is attacked by
ft series of convulsions lasting for sev
eral days. During these a faint line
of breakage appears down the middle
of the back, which gradually grows
broader with every spasm. The head
piece is the first to break entirely, and
suddenly a violent effort enables the
lobster to withdraw his head, leaving
the larger part of his eyes in the shell.
After a rest of a few hours the strug
gle begins again, and the shoulders, or
large claws, emerge, with effort so ex
hausting that nearly a day. is required
for recuperation.
During this time he presents a curi
ous spectacle, with head and body com
pletely out of the shell and only the
tail Inclosed. Then the convulsive
movements are resumed, and shell by
shell the tail covering Is loosened, un
til, with violent struggles, the tall Is
free, and the lobster, looking as if he
had been boiled, lies down for a sleep
of two or three days.
The new suit grows with ; great
rapidity and fits in perfect tailor made
style, literally molded to the, form.
Like the "rab, which is most ejteem
ed when "soft shelled," that is, at pre
cisely this period, which Is similar ln
both, the lobster Is regarded by epi
cures as especially delicious when thus
denuded of his shell covering, but as
he hides carefully among the rocks he
Is seldom procurable.— New York Trib

AN EXAMPLE OF NERVE.
Warden McClanghry's Experience
. 'With an Almost Escaped Prisoner.
"Speaking of nerve," said one of the
detectives at headquarters, "reminds
me of Chief McClaughry of Chicago.
He used to be warden at the state pen
itentiary down ln Jollet, and he had
the reputation of being the coolest man
in Illinois. He was as shifty as any of
the men be had to handle and as quick
and calm about it as a regular Sherlock
Holmes. . Nothing could feaze him.
"One day McClaughry was sitting In
his office at just about the time the
men were being marched back to their
cells from work. ' He was alone. There
was a sound behind him, and, whirling
round, he saw a convict who had pass
ed the guard ln some way creeping to
ward him with an ugly looking Iron
bar in his hand. V. --■
" 'Don't you stir!' the man whisper
ed. 'I'm going to get out of this If I
have to kill you to do It'
"'Oh,' McClaughry said, 'I thought
you were going tomorrow!' The man
stared at McClaughry and grunted,
'Wot?' McClaughry simply looked at
him as though he didn't care much and
said: 'They sent up your dismissal pa
pers this afternoon, that's all. Yoa've
been such a" model prisoner all the
time that they decided to commute
your sentence. You can go all right
enough if you want to. You're not my
prisoner any more. If you want to see
your papers— why, I think— they're here
in— in the drawer"— And before the
poor fool could lift the bar to strike
McClaughry had snapped a revolver
out of the "desk and leveled it at his
head."— New York Sun.
■* "Uier Saved Nor Earned.
Railroad people have an arrange
ment by which they can register the
speed of a train. It looks like a steam
gauge and Is connected with the axle,
so that the pointer registers the num
ber of revolutions every minute. There
are so many revolutions to tbe mile,
and by an ingenious arrangement the
number of miles an hour is shown up
on the dial. The apparatus Is expen
sive as well as delicate.
The late Jay Gould was one of the
first to adopt It, and shortly after a
register was placed in his private car
Russell Sage was making a journey
with him and inquired what it was.
Mr. Gould explained the mechanism
and the usefulness of the machine
with great care. Mr. Sage was silent
for a moment and then, looking up. In
quired:
"Does it earn anything?"
"No; I think not," said Mr. Gould,
with a smile.
"Does it save anything?"
"No."
"Then I would not . have it in my
car."— Chicago Record.
The Road to Snccess.
There is a mistaken notion that suc
cess in life is achieved only by bard ef
fort An "education" Is not necessary
to become successful in life, beyond
thorough familiarity with the rudi
ments. An education comes to an in
dustrious man as naturally as age.
Ability to deliver orations is not neces
sary. Industry and honesty, which are
easier than Idleness and dishonesty, will
achieve success for any man of ordi
nary ability. • Success Is easier, than
failure. Success seldom comes at once;
It is a matter of years of good conduct
«i»rl intellia-pnt work.— Atchlson Globe.
The wild white sheep is found no
where in the world but in Alaska, and
few specimens for mounting whole
have ever been obtained.
