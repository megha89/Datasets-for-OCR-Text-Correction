It has been estimated that tbe com
bustion of coal in .London discbarges
atlea st naif a million tons of sul
phuric acid into tbe air each year,
and tbe effect upon certain building
stones is disastrous. The acid washed
down by rains attacks tbe lime of
marbles, limestones and calcareous
sundstones, forming gypsum and
causing tbe surface to swell and crum
ble. A treatment for tbe decaying
stonework is tbe application of solu
tion of baryta, which forms an in
soluble sulphate witb tbe gypsum,
and liberates lime, which the car
bpnio acid of tbe air converts into the
original binding cement of tbe stone.
Referring to an experience at the
Chapter House at Westminster, Prof.
A. 11. Üburob states that carving so
soft as to be brought away by tbe
ringer was made sound and harder
tban tbe newly quarried stone.
The advantages of tne magnetite
electrode lamp over tba carbon arc, as
pointed oat by U. E. Little, are long
er life, higher efficiency and a pure
white instead ot mixed blue aud white
ligbt. Tbe negative electrode, fiom
wbioh tbe lump is inaccurately named,
is really a mixture of three metallic
oxides, each serving a distinct part in
forming this novel and promising
source of illumination. Tbe titanium
oxide renders tbe arc luminous, tbe
oxide of iron gives conductivity when
cold, and lbe oxide ot chromium pre
vents too rapid consumption.
The new experimental railway near
Berlin is laid in tbe form of an oval,
with a stiaigbt double track 820 feet
long and a total length of 5761 feet.
Motor-cars using steam, electricity
and benzine will be tried, lests will
be made with different materials for
bedding, various rails, sleepers of
oaK, pine, beech and iron, automatic
block-signals, and, in tact, everything
promising to add efficiency to tbe
Uerinau railways.
The transmission of photographs by
telegraph has reached tbe stage of
practical results, and actual seeing by
wire is expected to follow soon. Korn
reproduces pbotographs at a distance
through tbe varying eleatrical resist
ance of selenium, tbe changing cur
rent registering tbe lights and shades
uf successive points in proper place
on a sensitive plate at tbe receiving
end. Ihe telestereograpb of belin, of
Nancy, transmits photographs by a
different and purely mechanical
means, on selenium being used; while
the telegraphosoope of tbe same in
ventor is designed to produce an
image of any illuminated object or
scene at any distance. It is believed
that the problem of really seeing by
telegraph will be solved by making
tbe images to appear in more rapid
succession tban tbe retina cau separ
ate them. At present the sending
apparatus comprises a camera obscura
witb a lens and mirror to reflect tbe
optical image upon a row of eighty
tiny selenium cells, and a collector
tor successively inserting- these cells
in circuit. Xbe receiving station em
braces a highly sensitive galvano
meter witb three local circuits. Tbe
principal circuit contains tbe equili
brator and a telegraph ielay, tbe
primary circuit of a small induction
coil has in turn tbe second part of
the equilibrator, and tbe secondary
circuit of tbe coil has a gap whose
spark, controlled by tbe distributing
collector, perforates a paper with
very tine boles equally spaced between
centers, but of size varying to corres
pond with poiuts on tbe image. This
gives a picture resembling autotypy.
The equilibrator, the chief part, pro
rides a local current of sufficient
intensity to register decidedly every
change in tbe teeble current from the
selenium cells.
To give the greatest possible pre
cision to our knowledge of the atomic
weights of tbe elements, an inter
national commission corrects the list
each year in accordance with tbe most
reoent discoveries. Of tbe 79 ele
ments in the latest list, bydrogen is
still tbe lightest, witb an atomic
weight of 1.08. Tbe atomic weight of
oxygen is 16; gold, 197.'2; radium,
2*25; and uranium, tbe heaviest sub
stance, 238.5; while mercury, thall
ium, lead, bismuth and thorium are
all heavier tban gold.
The compressed air spray has been
used on surfaces, like tbe Eittel tower,
and for whitewashing tunnels. The
newer art of decorating small surfaces
by means of an air-brush seems to
have reached its highest development
in Uermany. Uf the two types of
apparatus, one is held like a pencil

and tin- other is used like a levolver,
and the air for spraying is supplied
from a cylinder of compressed air or
carbonic acid gas, or in a more primi
tive way by a band-pump. It is capa
ble of a great variety of applications.
The air-brush can be used for ordin
ary indnstrial painting by any un
skilled workman, while an artist of
some ability can paint flowers and
other designs upon enamel, glass,
porcelain, bronze, paper, and even
upon cloth, carpets and other fabrics.
It has proven specially serviceable in
retouching photographs.
Among the substances for which' a
suddeu demand bas sprung "up id tbe
metal cobalt. This bas been used
only for such purposes as coloring
glass, enamels and porcelains, and
the annual requirement has been only
about 150 tons. It bas tbe same hard
ening eilect on steel as nickel, but it
has not been considered for this pur
pose on accouut of its cost. New de
posits are now being sought as a sup
ply for storage batteries for wbich it
has proven an important material.
Bananas are now ripened by elec
tricity with great precision for any
required date. An air-tigbt case
fitted witb electric lamps contains
the bunches, and ripening is hastened
under the combined influence of the
artificial ligbt and beat. Tbe process
varies according to the number of

LETTER FROM ALASKA.
Dear Ledger :
Since my flying trip to Jackson
last November, 1 bave traveled more
than eleven thousand miles, over thir
ty-six states and teiritories, spent
several weeks attending the hospital
clinics in New York and lio.-turi, lec
tured on Alaska nearly fifty times, and
am now back again in the mighty
Northland."
Alaska's development continues, in
spite of its drawbacks, chief ot which
is the utterly vicious and indefensible
tax which is still exacted from tbe
people who are heroically braving a
bard climate and harder government
to win wealth for themselves aud fam
ilies.
Xbe gold output last year was over
twenty-two millions (82-2,000,000) the
copper and coal deposits are proving
of wonderful richness, but their de
velopment is still in its infancy. A
smelter at tiadlev, near the sontbern
end of tbe Panhandle, is tbe only one
yet in operation, but it can only han
dle the ore in its immediate vicinity.
Prince Williams Sound is Jull of
islands rich in copper, aud so is tbe
surrounding mainland. Tbe ore now
mined is sent to smelters near Seattle,
ships returning southward taking it
at a very low rate, as they need the
ballast.
Tbe Alaska Central railroad is still
pushing toward tbe Interior, but will
not reach tbe great coal deposits (de
scribed in a former letter) until next
year. Then smelters will be built
wherever it is most feasible to bripg
the coal and copper together, and tbe
region will begin to show what It is
wortb.
Times have been hard iv Juneau
and Douglas the past few montbs on
account of tbe great Treadwell mines
being closed by a strike. Troops were
brought from fort W. H. Seward to
preserve order, but no blood was shed,
Liusiness was at a standstill and gen
eral depression was felt by everybody.
After a time this state of attars bacame
monotonous, and tbe men gradually
returned to work. Yesterday the troops
were taken away, and all are hoping
for tbe old-time prosperity.
Three of tbe best mines near Juneau
have been idle on account of lawsuits,
for about two years. This spring the
legal tangles bave mostly been
straightened. Tbe looseness of tbe
laws regarding claim staking is re
sponsible for this uncertainty of titles.
Perhaps the fault lies in tbe officials,
who allow balf a dozen persons to
record locations of lbe same ground,
it they are willing to pay the record
ing fee, which fee goes into tbe
recorder's pocket.
The Perseverance Mine, which pro
mises to rival the I'readwell, began
active work early this month. Fifty
stamps are now dropping and it is ex
pected that three hundred will be in
place within a year. Two plants will
soon begin to crush rock.
Schools bave just closed. The
Juneau high school would be a credit
to any town, as far as work and re
sults are concerned.
Shipping fresh halibut and salmon
is an important industry that has
been developed here recently. Some
times tbe Usb are "mild cured," that
is packed with a very little salt, but
usually frozen witb an ice plant in
boxes weighing several hunrded
pounds each. In this way they are
shipped safely even as far as London.
Fruit is plentiful now. Oregon
strawberries, California oranges,
cherries, apricots and Australian
apples, all first class in quality and
price.
Juneau is lively to-day. Tbe first
excursion steamer of tbe season lies
at the wharf, and the town is full of
tourists, i'he Indians are out iv full
force with curios to sell, wbich the
tourists buy freely, and express their
wonder at finding a town witb such
luxuries as telephones, electric lights,
plate glass store fronts, etc.
Twenty seven hundred dollars have
been ißised for a Fourth of July cele
bration. How is that for a frontier
town? Yours same.as ever,

HOW ANDY SAVED THE TRAIN.
Melvina Troyan
Jitckson, Cal., agn 14.
The folluwiug little story from a
Jackson school girl was recently
published in tbe prize contest by the
San Francisco Chronicle. We repro
duce to show what can be done iv the
literary way by the school children
here. It is a very creditable pro
duction, considering the age of tbe
writer:
Andy Moore was a short, freckled
little countiy lad. Sometimes be
wore a Cdp and sometimes be did not.
His bair was shaggy red. As for what
people thought be did not care. He
did not live in tbe city, where one's
shoe lacings are noticed. He lived in
a very wild, rocky country. He kuew
more about rattlesnakes and birds
tban he did about fashions. He liked
to. sit rocking on the top of a great
tall tree. Andy's bouse was made of
mud, peat and logs, witb boles for
windows. Near bis father's house
there was a railroad track, and Andy
often watched the black engine as it
came putting past, belching out great
clouds of smoke aud steam.
One day, as Andy was strolling
across tbe track, be saw that there
was something wrong about it. He
did not know much about railroad
tracks, becauae'be was as yet quite a
little lad, and he had heard of cars
being tbrown off by such things.
Just then he heard a low, distant
noise. Dear, dear, the cars were com
ing then. He was but a little boy,
but perhaps be could stop them in
some 'way, aud there was nobody else
there, to do it.
Andy never thought that he might
be killed himself, but he went and
stood straight in tbe middle of the
track, just before the bad place on it
that 1 told you about, and stretched
out bis little arms as far apart as he
could. On came tbe cars. The
engineer saw tbe boy on the tree l ?
and whistled for him to get out of
the way. Andy never moved a hair.
Again the engine whistled. Andy
might bave been made of stone fur oil
the notice he took oi it. Then the
engineer had to stop the train, saying
something, in bis anger, to tbe boy
as he did so. But when Andy point
ed to the track and the man saw how
brave the little fellow was to save
all their lives, bis scolding changed
to blessing very soon.
Everybody rushed out to see what
a horrible death they bai escaped^
Ladies kissed Andy's rough, freck
eled lace aud cried over him, aud the
men, as they looked at their wives
md children, wiped their -eyes and
said: "(Jod bless the boy." And that
is not all. I bey took out their putses
and made up a large sum of money
for bim; not that they could ever
repay thft service he had done.
_Now, that boy had presence of
mind— brave little Andy. The pass
eugers all wrote down his name —
Andy Moore— and the place he lived
in. He was sent to school and in
after sears to college, and these
people whose lives he saved paid his
bills and belpe'l to make a place in
the world for him.
Up-to-date Living.
One ot the delegates to the electric
light convention at Washington, who
is builder and owner of the famous
"electrical house" at Scheuectady, N.
V., described his wonderful house to
the members. "To start with," he
sfdu, "1 bad plans drawn for two
houses, one with aud one without a
kitchen chimney. Tbe cost of the
chimueyless bouse was enough less
than the other to pay for the wiring
and equipment, and after a couple of
years' experience, 1 can say-^with my
wife's authority— that, nothing would
induce us to so back to coal and gas.
In tbe kitchen there are an electric
oven, griddle-cake cooker, meat
broiler, cereal cooker, water beater,
egg boiler, potato steamer, trying
pan, coffee percolator and a stove
for ordinary cooking utensils. Tne
whole outfit can bo purchased for
about $55. But this is not tbe only
way we use electricity, in the din
ing room there is a small electrio
table for a chafing dish aud per
colator. On the veranda and in the
smoking room electric cigar lighters
make matches and unknown quantity.
In tbe sewing room the machine is
run and tbe flatiron heated by elec
tricity. In the bathroom an electric
sbaviug mug furnishes hot water in
less than a minute. Au electrio nidi
tor takes the chill oft tbe room and
an electrio heater warms the water.
1 am not sure that, 1 have given you
a complete list of all our devices.
To build a Hre in our bouse means
simply to turn a switch or to turn a
plug, and the required degree of heat,
mild or extreme, is there in a few
seconds. The possibility ot regulat
ing the degree of bent exactly as
wanted results in considerable econ
omy of fuel. As to cost, 1 have Uept
careful records, and the average
moutbly bill tor electricity for two
years is £t>.(J!) a moutb, or about 10
per. cent more tbau we paid for coal
or gas. Aud there ere no asues to
cart away, go Urea to build, no dust
nor dirt. The electric kitchen is as
neat, clean end healthy as tbe sitting
room. There is no doubt that the
electrio home will be a commonplace
in a little while. Tho immeuso in
crease in tbe sale of all sorts of do
mestic electrical apparatus proves
that.

pector, secretary.— Democrat.
James V. Coleman, proprietor ot
the Angels Quartz Mine, is now in
Sau Francisco, and has given his
answer to the demands of Calaveras

l'he sudden ana cruel death of Bert
Kust, at Beach's saw mill Wednesday
evening, has added another name to
the long list of those who have met
tragic deaths in this county within a
few weeks. He was engaged in scal
ing logs. A few minutes before 6
o'clock he was talking with Jud
Young near the bottom ot the log
chute and both decided to wash and
go to dinner. Something started a
huge log that had lodged tempoiarily
above, and it commenced rolling
toward him, and, in jumping to
escape that one, another was set roll
ing and the unfortunate man was
caught batween the two, despite the
frantic effort of Young to catch hold
of him. His neck was broken, but
his body and head were not badly
crushed.— Mouutaiu Democrat.
An accident resulting iv the instant
death ot Henry Degelman and the
serious injury of Frank Phillips,
Babe Swartout and George Kientz,
occurred last Monday in Oregon
Kavine between the big cut and
Chinatown, where the electric com
pany has been establishing a sub
stntion for the purpose of giving the
city a supply from Stockton iv case
the power should fail at the American
river. Tbe electric lines have been
placed and the men were stretching a
private telephone wire for the com
pany's use, below tbe power line.
Some of the men were stationed
nearly up to the edge of the big cut
aud others were just below the old
Dower house opposite the Catboilc
church. About half-way between tbe<
two the line passes over the bin bnilt
by F. A. Uerbode to hold the crushed
rock from his rook breaker. At the
upper station the telephone wire was
being unwound from a reel and Uea.
Kientz, Cbas. Williams and Babe
Swartout were handling the wire,
Louis Ferretta being at the reel.
Henry Degeiman was pulling at the
lower end of the wire to stretch it
aud Frank Phillips was assisting in
some way, (Jeorge Myers being on a
pole near by, Frank Gerbode's boy
was on the bin, but was not working
for the company, in pulling the wire
it caught in a bush, and, when jerked
at the lower end it flew upward, com
ing in contact with the heavily
charged wires above. Degelman was
standing on wet ground aud it is
stated that 33,000 volts were conduct
ed through his body. His fellow
linemen were thrown to the ground,
all badly burned, bruised and uncon
scious. — Mountain Democrat.
Friday afternoon last the eight
year-old Cuneo boy, who resides
with his mother on a vegetable ranch
about a mile from this place, sustain
ed a fracture of the right arm betweeu
the elbow aud wrist, as tbe lesult ot

ot Jackson wus called to attend to
the injury.— Mokelumne Crhonicle.
The work of construction on tbe
buildings for the Pottery Plant is
going along rapidly. The tramework
of the main building and engine room
is all in place and the excavation is
rnaclo for tbe 15-ton elevator. In a
few days tbe work ot building tbe
tirst kiln will be begun and it is ex
pected that tbe first fire brick will be
made about August Ist. But the
work will not begin in earnest before
Septomher. There will be much wcrk
ot an experimental nature to be done,
looking toward the rinding of the
very best materials for the purpose,
before tbe making ot flre brick for
the market will be energetically
prosecuted by the company. It is
probable that the pottery, will be giv
ing employment to from M to 75 men
by next season. —Echo.

The season is moving on. Our summer goods must

where you will reap most benefit by reductions, inas-
much as all the merchandise offered is positively new,
fresh, and prices represent but a portion of the actual
values. No argument is necessary to impress upon
the economically inclined man or lady the . practica-
bility of an early response.

Amotjg the bill.s passed uj&utu unor
mouth bj the board of supervisors,
our readers a ill notice a claim for
postage stumps. Postage ia a necessary
adjunct of any governmental body, or
ot any business for that matter,
whether public or private. No doubt
a larue number ot stamp3 are needed
in the transsctiou of the business of
Amador couuty. The bill for this
item foot up between S20 and 830
inuuttily. This means from 1200 to
15U0 two ceut stamps) used on au aver
age each montb. This will give an
average of SI ot fifty stamps per work
iug day. The offices of tax collector,
clerk, school superintendent, assessor
aud recorder must use postage liber
ally. We do not say, or wish to inti
mate, that the amount is needlessly
heavy, Uut we call attention to this
matter particularly on account of the
manner in which the bills for postage
Hre presented to the board of super
visors. Formerly it was customary
for the treasurer to put in the bills".
The stamps are obtained through his
office. Hut he naturally did not take
kindly to heing charged with the
whole amount, as many got the idea
that he was personally using the full
amount. Then the present method
was inangurated, namely of putting
iu the bill in the name of county
officers. No individual official is
mentioned, but the bill is allowed
tor all -ot them bunched together as
"county officers, postage, 825." If
the former method was objectionable
aud illegal, the new way is equally
so; indeed it is more indeHnite and
objectionable. As it reads the claim
comes from no one in particular.
The law on this point says: '
Sec. 4071. No county officer shall,
except for bis own servioea, present
any claim, account or demand tor
allowance against the county, nor in
any way advooate the relief on the
claim or demand made by another.
If an individual county official is
prohibited under the law from pre
senting a claim, it follows as a logical
conclusion, that the officials collect
ively have no anthonty to do so.
There are sound reasons for this re
striction. To permit officials to be
interested in, or present claims in
dividually or collectively, would
tend to abuses. An expert employed
in one of the northern conuties to in
vestigate the books, found that the
treasurer had been presenting a claim
tor postage stamps, and in his report
he contended that the practice was
illegal, aud "houldcot be tolerated.
The taxpayers would like to know
more definitely how this mass of post
age stamps is distributed, and fasten
upon each officer bis particular shaie
of the burden, it must be remember
ed that the amount does not include
postal cards, which are usually ob
tained by the printer, and the cost
thereof included in his printing bill.
This amounts to considerable iii
course of the year.
The whole nation is amazed at the
revelations of corruption in connec
tion with the municipal government
of Ban Francisco. But the stricken
city of the bay does not monopolize
tbe graft business. Probably nearly
every county government would be
found more or lea* tainted with the
same spirit. We believe a thorough
m investigation by a grand jury not
afraid of work, and uninfluenced by
any other desire than the public weal
might find a profitable lield in Ama
dor county.
As an almost invariable result of a
change in the office of assessor, there
is considerable dissatisfaction with
the pieseut assessment valuations
Many changes have been made, nearly
all in the direction of swelling the
roll. Ibis has been done by the
official for tbe purpose ot equalizing
the valuation. No matter how laud
able the motive, any attempt to dis
tribute the burden ot taxes more
equitably will surel yraise a storm. It
is a mistaken notion also that an in
erense of the assessment means a lower
in* of the tax rate, i'he history of
Amador county is a sufficient refutat
ion of this notion. We had two-thirds
ot the property values 20 years ago
and the rate per 8100 was |jeßsj eB s then
tLau now. The outcry-born of the
socialistic element-raised during the
political campaign against corpora
tions not bearing their fair share of
taxation,- should be given little
weight. Whatever may be said of
corporations that are paying regula.
dividends, and likely to continue to
do so for many years, the case of
mimuß companies is of an entirely
different character, and should be so
treated for assessment purposes if
tbe socialist doctrines are directed
against the mining companies, aud
carried into practica it will prove tbe
greatest calamity that this county
uas experienced. It is not progress,
tut retrogression. It is all very well
for fly-aways to preach socialism, and
practice the same by getting out of
Amador as soon as tbeir aspirations
for office are blighted, but those who
have property interests at stake take
a very dilferent view of tbe situation.

ries, specially printed for Amador
county, may be bad at the Ledger

of supervisors, 10,000 souvenir postal
cards, for free distribution at the
national meeting of teachers in Los
Angeles next week. The cards were

week. They represent, ten views of

tbe power plant at Electra, Kennedy
mine, Keystone mine, Fremont mine
and hoist, a logging team. Com
mercial hotel at love, W. M. Amick's
residence and oiange trees, birdseye

thousand cards of each kind were
printed. Tbe object is to attract
attention to Ibis favored section ot
California, in tbe hope tor drawing
some share ot immigration. This is
merely a first effort in this diteotion.
It should be followed up by other
efforts. What is needed is a pamph
let, illustrated with suitable cuts,
settiug forth tbe facts concerning
Amador. We are not gathering
population because we are doing
nothing to that end. We are content
to remain listless and indifferent,
while others are working like beaveis,

It is n.ot within the power of the
oounty supervisors or the city fathers,
by a simple notice signed by them!
to give permission for a violation of
any ordinance duly passed by them.
It shows a lamentable weakness to
make any attempt to that end. City
trustees cannot temporarily hold up
an ordinanoe, and say the people are
authorized to violate between certain
opeoiHed hours. Ordinances nan only
De amended or chauged by another
ordinanoe, pas3ed in legal form. It
brings local government into con
tempt for the lawmakers to say the
provisions ot their law can be ignored
for a certain period. The "now it's
law, and now it isn't" proposition is
a new wrinkle in local government.

The Fourth
In Jackson
Jackson celebrated tbe fourth in a
quiet way yesterday. Witbal it prob
ably gave more real pleasure to those
present than many v more pretentious
I demonstration in honor of the na
tional birthday witnessed in the past.
jlt was intended as a hoir.e affair— to
ali'ord some enjoyment to tbe stny-ut
j home crowd. And as such it was an
unqualified success. 'Ibe affair was
nnder the management of the Jackson
| social and athletio club and the Uni
form Hank. Subscriptions amounting
,to Enmetbing over 5100 had been col
] lected from citizens to provide prizes
to be contested for iv the various
amusements, which wore the exclusive
attractions of the day. Literary ex
ercises, procession, oration, were
loouspicuously absent. The Jackson
; band discoursed music, and this was
. tbe sum total in that line. There were
few from outside the towsnbip, but
the city aud its surround ings are
ample to turn out an imposing crowd
of pleasure seekers.
The fun commenced in tbe afternoon
at tbe baseball grounds of tbe club
beyond tbe Zeila mine. Here a ball
game was played between the Jackson
team and a nine from lone. There
was also blue rock shooting for var
ious prizes uear by. In the ball game
the Jacksons won, alter a hard battle,
with a score ot 4to 3. The even*; of
throwing tbe hammer was decided at
on the bail ground, O. Dalporta suc
ceeding in pitching it the furthest,
and took tbe prize of 85. There was a
big attendance to witness these sports,

N. B. Shilling, who died suddenly
of heart failure in Ban Francisco,
with his brother Joseph Schilling,
was the owner of the old Williams
place in this valley, and had many
friends here who deeply regret his

Superstitious.
A well known New Yorker, while
dining at his club one evening, ob
served that his order of oysters on the
shell was not complete, there being
only eleven bivalves Instead of the
dozen it was his custom to order. On
reflecting that his waiter, an Irishman,
was a newcomer, he decided to let the
matter pass, but when on the next
evening the same thing occurred he
became a trifle impatient.
"See here," exclaimed he to the wait
er, "what do you mean by bringing me
eleven oysters when I order twelve?
This is the second time that this thing
hns happened."
"Sure, sir," quietly responded the
Celt, "I didn't think you would want to
risk being thirteen at table, sir."
When Life Ii Wasted.
Life is wasted every time one gives
away to gloomy, selfish angry or re
vengeful thoughts; when resentment
or a grudge against man or fate Is al
lowed to find root In the heart; when
the temper is let fly loose over a trifle;
when one goes to pieces nervously
when obliged to repeat a remark and
the voice is allowed to rise in anger;
when one forgets that a loose temper
Is a sign of vulgarity and lack of cul
ture.— Philadelphia Press. (
Julius Caesar.
The consensus of learned opinion Is
to the effect that history's all around
greatest man was Julius Caesar, the
originator of Roman imperialism. Cae
sar was great as a general and great
as a writer aud speaker, but greater

spared the assassin's dagger and been
permitted to live ten years longer he
might have set civilization ahead a
full thousand years.— New York Ameri

At the county hospital last Thurs
day thoie passed fiom all earthly
scenes an eccentric and peculiar char
acter in the person of Kobert Waddell.
He was 7H years of age, and a well
known charaoter around Plymouth
and vicinity. In the years when Ply
mouth was in its pnmv, when the
Plymouth Consolidated was turning
out its golden treasures liberally,
Waddell was employed, as night
watchman. But witb the shutdown
of that great propeily he has been
idle, except doing little odd jobs. He
continued to live in the old towD, oc
cupying a small cabin alone, and
attending to himself tbe tjest he
could, uutil that tatal malady,
ISrigbt's disease, overtook him, and
rapidly sappnd the foundations of life.
He clung to his little home as long
as he could, witb the neighbors sup
plying him with food, etc., until the
inroads of disease rendered it im
practicable to do so.
It waa then decided to remove him
to the county hospital, lie had talk
ed a good deal about his money, and
what disposition be wished to make
of it. From the way in whicb be
lived, taking one meal a day at a
restaurant, and complaining that he
could not afford that, tbe neighbors
were disinclined to take much stock
in his claim to hidden wealth. He
had a paper drawu vp — in the nature
of a testamentary disposition of his
property— giving everything to <his
friend Mervin Leach.
This waa signed by him in tbe pres
ence of witnesses, lie bad nephews
and neices, it is said, in the southern
part of the state, and a brother in the
eastern states, but they tlgured not in
tbe distribution.
Before leaving his cabin he was
urged to reveal the hiding plane of
his hoarded gold. Finally, he told
where his bank account was kept
He pointed to a spot in tbe floor, and
behind a piece of wainsooating, where
they would dud a tin can containing
126J0 in gold coin. He was~much of
a misanthrope, bad little faith io
human nature generally, but there
were tbree men in Plymouth in whom
he was willing to trust. In tbe
presence of U. W. Easton, Lawrence
Burke and Mervin Leach, the boards
were taken up, and there sure enough
was a tin oan, representing tbe ac
cumulated savings of a lifetime. The
money was all in gold coin. It was
taken oat and counted, and found to
contain 52650.
Waddell, in the final stages of
Urrgbt's disease, was brought to tbe
county hospital on Saturday, June 22.
tie was in a sadly neglected state.
He died on Thursday morning, Juue
27. It was bis special request to be
buried in the cemetery at Plymouth.
So the same day H. X Potter, tbe
undertaker, came 'over and removed
the remains, and the funeral took
place on Saturday last.
Deceased was a native of Ohio, 73
years of age. He bad lived in this
county for over thirty years. When
received into the hospital he had
about §12 on his person, and from this
fund bis expenses while in tbe hos
pital were paid.
Died from Typhoid Fever.
John A. Votaw, a well known resi
dent of tbe northern section of tbe
county, died at bis ianch at Forest
Home last Monday. He was taken
down with typhoid fever only a few
days before tbe fatal termination.
He was a former resident of the vicin
ity of Oieta, but some two years ago
he bought tbe ranch of K. F. Allen
near Forest Home, since which time
be made his borne at tbat place. He
leaves to mourn then loss a widow
and four children, tbe widow being a
sister of N. B. Schilling, whose sudden
death in San Francisco last Saturday
is reoorded in this issue. The inter
ment took place in the Oleta cemetery
vesteiday, Key. Thomas Dermody of
tbe Catholic church officiating.

Took Muriatic Acid.
The Sutter Creek Kecord says Miss
Annio Dnvidde ou ihursday of last
week, took a large dose of muriatic
acid with suicidal intent. At the hour
of going to press Dr. A. P. Griffin,
the attending physician, could give
but little hope ot the young lady's
recovery. A trained nurse arrived
from Stockton last Friday, and re
mained a tew days to give skillful
care during the moat critical period
in tbe efforts to save tbe lady's life
under the instruction of the physic
iau. The large quantity of acid taken
into tbe stomach has caused tbat or
gan to fail to properly assimilate food
aud until tbat condition can be re
gained the cbacnes ot recovery must be
uncertain, although tho latest symp
toms are considered favorable. Ihe
acid was taken during a spell of des
pondency, and the patient now very
much regrets her rash act.

Weighing Mails.
Postmaster F. A. Duden has orders
trom Washington to weigh nil mail
matter daily that leaves bis office.
Heretofore, tbe weighing bas been
done on the railroads. But for the
next six months, every' postmaster
will be required to keep an account
ot the weight of mail daily. This
includes all classes ot mail matter.
•L'he new older is for the purpose of
getting an accurate idea of tbe weight
of mail carried by the railroad lines,
as a criterion for action by congress
at the next session in regard to the
mail contracts. Of course, this work
imposes quite an extra burden upon
tbe postmasters, it is not permanent,
however, aud will be dropped after
six months.

Standing out in bold relief, all alone^
and as a conspicuous example of open,
frank and honest dealing with the siclt
and afflicted, are Dr. Pierces Favorite
Prescription for weak, over-worked, de

for weak stomach, Indigestion, or dys
pepsia, torpid liver, or biliousness, all
catarrhal affections wiethcr of the
stomach, bowels, kidneys, bladder, nasal
passages, throat, bronchia, or other mu

for all diseases arising from thin, watery
or impure blood, as scrofulous and skin
affections.
Each bottle of the above medicines
bears upon its wrapper a badge of hon
esty in the full list of ingredients com
posing it — printed in plain English.
This frank and open publicity places
these medicines in a class all by them
selves, and is tho best guaranty of their
merits. They cannot be classed as patent
nor secret medicines for they are neither
— being of knwon composition.
Dr. Pierce feels that he can afford to
take the afflicted into his full confidence
and lay all the ingredients of his medi
cines freely befdre them because these
ingredients are such as are endorsed and
most strongly praised by scores o( tho
most eminent medical writers as cures
for tho diseases for which these medi
cines are recommended. Therefore, the
afflicted do not have to rely alono upon
Dr. Pierces recommendation as to tho
curative value of his medicines for cer
tain easily recognized diseases.
A glance at the printed formula on
each bottle will show that no alcohol and
no harmful or habit-forming drugs enter
Into Dr. Pierces medicines, they being
wholly compounded of glyceric extracts
of the roots of native, American forest
plants. These are best and safest for
the cure of most lingering, chronic dis
eases. Dr. It. V. Pierce can be consulted

"Flirting" With Brook Trout.
If the farmer boy is more successful
in his catch than the city fisherman it
is because he realizes the advantage
of keeping out of sight. Of course the
supposition Is that other conditions are
equal. Familiarity with a stream of
ten has much to do with the size of
the string. Trout especially love to
hide under wooden bridges, water
soaked logs, branches, etc. They seem
to realize that safety is found in such
places. When the current will not take
the worm to these spots one must re
- sort to "flirting." This is done by
holding the hook In the left hand and
bending the pole until tHe tension is
sufficient to throw the worm over the
spot. Considerable practice Is neces
sary to make the bait land exactly
where it is wanted, but "flirting" is an
art well worth acquiring.— Circle.

hunter proudly. '"I killed one of the
finest bucks yesterday I ever saw, and
he weighed over two hundred." It was
the season ffhen deer may not be shot
without subjecting the hunter to a
heavy fine. "Well, that is a fine one,"'
said tbe warden, "and do you know
who you are talking to?" Being assur
ed that lie did not, the official said.
"Why, I am the chief game warden of

*its primitive form the violin was
ect development of the lyre and
«chord— the strings from the for^
mer and the elongated box, with its
sound holes, finger board and movable
bridge, from the latter. The history
of the violin began with the invention
of the bow some time before the thir
teenth century, when the voile, or vielle,
used by the troubadours, made its ap
pearance. This instrument underwent
many changes until the middle of the
sixteenth century, when the true violin
model appeared. The primitive violin
had little or no contour. It was not
until the thirteenth century that the
vielle was scooped out at the waist
The corner blocks were added in the
fifteenth century and are attributed
to Germany. For nearly a century
the sound holes were shifted all over
the instrument before they were cut
in their proper place and the bridge
fixed between them.— Circle Magazine.

she said: "I do not feel as though I

I have been a transgressor for a good

seen the light I believe that my place
is in a dark corner, behind the door."
Brother Smith was next called upon
for his testimony and, following the
example set by Sister Jones, said: "I,
too, have been- a sinner for more than
forty years, and I do not think It would
be fitting for me to stand before this
assembly as a model. I think my place
is behind the door, in a dark corner,

why the meeting was convulsed with

pray.
Don't Whisk Your Hat.
Never use a whisk broom to clean a
hat, either stiff or soft, particularly
a soft hat, as it gradually removes the
fine surface originally on tbe hat. The
worst effect, however, is the wearing
away of the band and binding by such
rough usage. The effect is more
quickly shown on the best grades of
bands and binding. A fine hair brush,
one of curved shape, made especially
to use under the curl of the hat, is
good. Best of all, however, is a thick
piece of woolen cloth. Such pieces are
now made In the form of pads, with
a strap across the back, so that they

THE AMADOU LEDGEB; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. JULY 5, 1907.
A NEW
RIP VAN WINKLE
[Original.]
One morning Walter Van Winkle, a
lineal descendant of the great Kip,
awoke in the Catskills. The only dif
ference between the first and the last
Van Winkle was that the first slept
twenty years, the last forty, Walter
had gone to the mountains one summer
with a party of youug New York bank
clerks, had got separated from the oth
ers and bad taken a four decade nap.
Descending the mountain, he footed
it to Catsklll and was surprised to
come upon a railway station. A train
was pulling out and he jumped aboard.
The ccKductor on collecting his fare
punched a printed slip and handed it
to him.
"What's this?" asked Van Winkle.
"Excess fare."
"What'll I do with it?"
The conductor passed on without re
ply, and a passenger explained that
the slip was a check on the conductor
to guard against his stealing the fare
collected. Van Winkle looked at his
informant aghast.
"And the management makes spies
of its conductors? And they submit
to such a system ?"
"Conductors and passengers are both
the company's spies now."
Van Winkle gave a low whistle.
"Is this want of trusting to individ
ual honor confined to railroads?"
"By no means. No one is trusted ex
cept the managers, and they are trying
to beat one another."
"Is there no standard of honor?"
"No. Once a merchant who failed
felt disgraced; now merchants fail in
order to make money."
When Van Winkle reached New York
he went to the banking house where he
had been employed. It was now on
the ground floor of a thirty story sky
scraper. Of ' course he knew no one
there, or, rather, no one knew him.
So he wrote a note to the president,
Richard Trimble, who had been a clerk
with him forty years before and on the
camping trip at which he had disap
peared. Van Winkle was shown into
the president's private office and re
ceived with suspicion. Not daring to
give the Rip Van Winkle story, he said
he had gone to see the world. He
asked for a position, and there being a
vacancy in a department where large
sums were handled he was appointed.
The salary was $800 a year.
"Eight hundred a year for guarding
millions!" exclaimed Van Winkle.
"All that's changed, Walter. We
don't need to rely ou our employees'
honesty now; we insure it" *
"Insure It?"
"Yes. A company for a premium
takes the risk."
"And do you mean, friend of my boy
hood, to insure me?"
"As president of the bank I can't
help doing so. It's a rule made by the
directors."
"Then If I come in here to work for
you I am at liberty to beat the bank if
I can?"
"Certainly."
"Do you refrain from beating it be
cause of your integrity?"
"I'd be a fool to beat it— illegally."
"I see."
"Sorry I can't do any better for you,
Walter. You should have stuck to
business as I have instead of roaming
all over the world."
"Let me ask you one question, Dick."
"Go ahead."
"Are you an honest man?"
Trimble put his lips to Van Winkle' 3
ear and whispered: "Only in small
things, not in big ones; no petty lar
ceny for me. This is between me and a
friend of my boyhood."
"It's taken you years to learn to be
dishonest I've learned it in one day. I
see it's become the fashion."
"You might as well wear a plug hat
made of beaver as to be honest— that
Is, what we used to call honest"
"I see. When shall Igo to work?"
"Tomorrow, If you like."
When Van Winkle appeared at the
bank the next day he found a photo
grapher there. President Trimble came
out of his private office and said :
"You'll have to be photographed,
Walter."
"What for?"
"Oh, the rule is to have a photograph
of all our employees. They're easier
caught if they light out with the funds
of the bank."
"A sort of rogues' gallery?"
"It's for those who become rogues.
Most concerns get their clerks together
occasionally and photograph them in
groups. Makes the boys feel their im
portance, and the concern has the gal
lery. But we don't stoop to that. We
take a picture of every employee be
fore he begins work."
• "Is there any more of tbis sort of
thing to learn?"
"Yes; one. You'll have two weeks'
vacation during the year— two vaca
tions of one week each at six months'
Interval."
"I don't want any vacation. I lost
forty years by my last vacation."
"But you must take yr>ur vacation."
"Why so?"
"That we may have an opportunity
to examine your accounts."
"Poor dog Trust's dead indeed!" re
marked Van Winkle, with a sickly
smile.
"Better dead than dying. Give me a
community of honor or one of ac
knowledged roguery."
"Is there any community in Ameri
ca where our former standard still ex
ists?"
"Not in commercial life."
"How about the army?"
"There's a good deal left there, I be
lieve."
"Very well; I'll go there. I'm too old
to enlist, but I can become a mule
driver, and that's better than making
money under the rogue system."
And he did. OSC.I R COX.
Very Much Settled.
An elderly woman, on being exam
ined before the magistrate of Bungay
as to her place of legal settlement, was'
asked what reasons she had for sup
posing that her deceased husband's
settlement was at St. Andrews.
The old lady looked earnestly at the
bench and said:
"He was born there, he was married
there, and they buried him there; and !
if that isn't settling him thtre, I'd like
to know what is!"— London Telegraph, j
He Listened to All.
Fontenelle listened to everything, and
he offended no one by disputing any
thing. At tbe close of his life he was
asked the secret of his success, and he
replied that it was by observing two
maxims, "Everybody may be right"
and "Everything may be so."
The true strength of every human
soul Is to be dependent on as many

pended upon by as many inferior as it
can reach.— Buskin.
HIS FIANCEES
RELATIVE.
[Original.]
''Hey, cabman! Hold on!"
"I've got a fare, sir," pulling up.
"What is it?" asked a gentleman
from inside the cab.
"The rain is spoiling my uniform,"
said the man who had called the cab
from the curb of a street in Berlin. "I
can't' hire a conveyance for love or
money."
"Where do you go?" asked the gen
tleman.
" "Anywhere till you alight"
" "Very well; step in."
. A young lieutenant of artillery got
i into the cab and sat down beside the
g gentleman, ' who was quite old and
w whose civilian's clothes and quiet de-
m meanor were- in marked contrast with
t the lieutenant's uniform and self con
ffident air. The latter had been lunch
iing with friends, and the wine he had
d drunk had imparted a rosy hue to his
c cheeks and stimulated his tongue.
■ "Well, well, my venerable friend,"
h he said gayly, "I'm in luck, and you
a are very good to let me In your cab.
I have an engagement to meet a young
l lady. I don't mind telling you— you
w who have been so good to me— that she
i is my fiancee. How would I look go-
i ing into her presence all bedraggled?
A And she a relative of one of the first
m men iv the empire." \ - " v^:;? -c.' ~-.- T\
""Whom would you call one of the ■
f first men in the empire?" asked the
o old gentleman. . .7 ;
" "That would be telling a stranger
t the name of the lady to whom I am
e engaged. However, you may guess."
" "A member of the reichstag?" was
t the first guess. - . .
" "A bigger man than that." £
" "A colonel in the army?" » ".
" "A great deal bigger man than a
c colonel, but I will admit he is a sol
ddier."
T The gentleman guessed a number of
g generals, going higher and higher with
e each-guess. Not having guessed aright
h he gave it up. . . > ;■ . ' ' . _
" "But you have not guessed high
e enough. There is one still higher than
a all, the commander in chief." ",'."■
" I thought you said he was one of
t the first men in the empire." < ' ■ .
" I should call Field Marshal yon
M Moltke a pretty big man. He is a great
m man. one of the greatest who have
e ever lived." .. .. : •
" "Yes, a very great man in the esti-
m mation of the people, j But if he should
l lose a battle those who hurrah for. him
l loudest would decry him loudest It's
h hero worship." ■■■ ■;.. -
- "My friend, if the law of leze majes
tty were applicable to him I would re-
p port you. I have a good mind to do so
a any way. Who are you to speak so dis-
r respectfully of the man next in Impor
ttance to the emperor?" j ■
" I have guessed to whom your fian-
c cee is related. Suppose you guess who
I am." *
" "A merchant?"
" "No."
" "A lawyer?"
" "No."
" "Better than those
" I suppose so." "
" "You have a position in the govern-
m ment?"
" "Yes."
" "In what department?"
" "The army." i:V~/
T This sobered the lieutenant, but not
e enough to prevent his guessing fur
tther.
" "A retired colonel?"
■ "Higher rank than that"
" "A general of brigade?"
" "Higher."
T The lieutenant guessed successively
a all 'ranks except general in chief, then
s said:
" "You're fooling me."
" "No. You have not guessed high
e enough."
" "Nonsense. There only remains Field
M Marshal yon Moltke." • .• •
A At that moment the cab drew up at
a a house, and the gentleman got out, ex
ppressing himself pleased at having say-
e ed the young man's uniform and a be
ddraggled appearance before his fiancee.
T Then the cab was driven on. " i
T The lieutenant, who believed the man
h had been chaffing him, thought no-more
a about the matter and, having told the
c cabman where to take him, took a nap.
P Presently he was awakened by stop-
p plug before his fiancee's residence, got
o out, paid the cabman and sent him
a about other business. The next morn
iing the lieutenant, who was on leave
f from his corps, stationed in the prov
iinces, returned to his post.
W When lie again visited Berlin it was
t to be married. The ceremony had been
p performed, and the guests were seated
a at the wedding breakfast when a small,
s slight old man in uniform entered the?
r room. Every guest rose at once ex-
c cept the groom. His bride pulled at
h his coat sleeve. lie did not move, but
s sat with his eyes starting from their
s sockets and fixed on the approaching
o officer.
" "For heaven's sake, Heinrieh, what
i is it?" exclaimed the frightened bride.
" "Get up. It is the field marshal, my
i iDiisiu's uncle."
" "Gott iin bJUnmel!" gasped the groom.
" "It is the old man in the cab!"
T The marshal advanced straight to the
b bride, kissed her and offered his hand
t to her husband, who by this time was
s standing straight as a ramrod and loofc-
i ii»3 as if lie expected to have his epau
llets torn off and himself confined in a
f fortress for the rest of his natural life.
B But the old man pressed his band, loofc
llng at him kindly, and said:
" "Ach! You are the gentleman who
p paid me such high compliments. I
h hope you will have as high an appre-
c ciation for your wife as you have for
t the head of the army."

A President's Daughter.
When President Grant's only daugh
ter, Xellie, afterward Mrs. Sartorls,
was a miss of twelve years, she at
tended a private school iv Washington.
One afternoon, says the author of "The
Olivia Letters," Nellie's lessons were
not learned. The carriage came for
her, but the teacher dismissed it with
the request that it should return at
the end of a half hour. The half hour
came and glided away with the lesson
still unlearned. The carriage came
again and *vas dismissed. At the end
of the second half hour the lesson was
committed, and Miss Nellie was per
mitted to go. The next day at the
usual hour the young lady arrived, ac
companied by her mother. The teach
er begun to fear she had lost her most
cherished pupil, but Mrs. Grant came
to thank her for performing her duty.
"Teach her," said Mrs. Grant, "that
she is only plain, simple Nellie Grant,
subject to the same rules whicli govern
all the scholars. This course will have
my sincere approbation."
A Locomotive
Engineer's Yarn.
[Original.]
"Speaking of railroad men's over
work," said the veteran locomotive en
gineer, "we were a good deal more
overworked thirty years ago than you
are now. The nearest I ever came to
being killed was— when I was a young
ster just starting In as an engineer—
from running one night Into » locomo
tive standing dead on the main track.
The engineer and fireman of the en
gine we butted were so dead tired that
they had gone to sleep there right
where they were sure to obstruct thp
passage of trains.
"But. I had an experience once to
beat that," he continued after biting
off a chew. "It was when I was run
ning the night express on the R., D.
and N. Usually I had all the rest I
needed, but at the time of the accident
at Tomkinsvllle everything was disar
ranged, and my sleep was cut consid
erably short It was two days after
the accident that my old friend Bob
Williams told me he was ordered to
the other end of the line to take the
train tnat I met In the middle of the
night He was to run it regularly
thereafter and was going down with
me. He started in the cab with me,
but at tlie first stop we ma.de in about
an hour he said be would go back into
the baggage car, rig himself up some
sort of a bunk and go to sleep. I told
Frank Curtis, my stoker, that I wish
ed Bob would offer to spell me at the
throttle for awhile, as I was mighty
sleepy. Frank said he wished some
body would spell him, for he was both
sleepy and tired.
"We made a midnight stop at 8., and
Just as we were pulling out who should
climb into the cab but Williams. With
out a word he took the throttle out of
my hand, and I understood that he
proposed to take my place for awhile.
The stoker was sitting on tbe cab seat
pulling the bell, and, ordering him off,
I took his place, while he went back
into the tender and threw himself on
tbe coal. I kept on pulling the bell,
trying to keep awake, but it was no
use. I went to sleep, though I thought
I was awake, for I heard the bell and
was conscious of ringing it I suppose
I was both asleep and awake, like sol
diers are sometimes in battle when
they've been marching and fighting for
a long while without rest There must
have been some wakefulness In me or
I couldn't have kept my narrow seat,
for we were rattling along at express
speed, and the road wasn't straight ei
ther.
"How Ions; I was in this condition I
don't know, but a big lurch woke me
up, and there on a semaphore ahead
was 'the red.' Starting up, I looked
over where Williams had been, and
what do you suppose— he wasn't there,
nor any one else. The engine was tear
ing along like mad at its own swieet
will through stations, over crossings
and bridges, past sidetracked trains,
and there was 'the red' staring us in
the face. I jumped for the throttle and
slowed down, then whistled down the
brakes, for you must know that was
before the day of the air brake. I
glanced around for Frank and saw
him laid out on the coal heap sound
asleep. I yelled at him and woke him
up.
"Well, speak of a man's marrow
freezing with horror. My whole body
was frozen with horror. My teeth chat
tered, and I shivered all over. We
were approaching N., and I knew that
since I had given up my place to Bob
we had run eighteen miles. How much
of that time we had been without an
engineer I didn't know, but I found
out that if I hadn't been wakened up
by the lurch just in time to catch sight
of 'the red' we would have been tel
escoped Into a 'passenger* standing on
the track at the next station ahead.
"But Bob Williams — what could
have happened to him? Something, of
course, or he wouldn't have left his
post I could think of nothing unless
he had become unconscious, fallen to
the floor and rolled at a lurch out of
the cab. As soon as I got the train to
a stop I told Frank to go back to find
out if any one had seen or heard of
him. Frank came back, with blank
astonishment written all over his face,
and reported that Williams was cud
dled up on a pile of trunks in the bag
gage car sound asleep.
"I was obliged to wait till signaled
to go on and, leaving the cab, went
back to the baggage car. Sure enough,
there was Williams sleeping as peace
fully as a newborn babe.
"The first idea that came into my
head was that I had dreamed he had
come back and spelled me, but I knew
Ha at if I had fallen asleep without
some one to take my place I would
have done so at my post. Besides,
there was Frank. He wouldn't have
gone to sleep and dreamed the same
dream as I. I was all balled up In a
puzzle. I lost no time in waking Wil
liams.
" 'Have you been running my en
gine?' I asked.
•"Your engine? No. How could I?'
" 'Either you or your ghost came to
me and took the throttle out of my
hand.'
"He sat up, looking at me in a sort
of dazed condition for awhile, then
suddenly turned pale.
" 'What's the matter?' I asked.
" 'I wonder If I've been up to my old
tricks,' he said, catching his breath.
"'What old tricks ?'
" 'Why, didn't you know I was a
sleepwalker?'
"I went back to my engine and took
the train through, but I couldn't get
my sleep the next day for the horrors
and have hardly got over them when 1
tell the story to this day."
RAYMOND GANNON.
"Tipping" In Europe.
According to immemorial usage, En
ropeau servants are entitled to tips as
an assured part of their Income. At
the hotels the theory is that the land
lord furnishes a guest a private room
and the use of the public rooms, heat
and light, food and dishes, but not
menial service. For convenience he
keeps at hand a corps of servants who
will respond to the guest's summons,
but at his expense. In old times trav
elers were attended by their own serv
ants to wuit on them. The modern
custom echoes the undent. The trav
eler uo longer carries with him a ret
inue of servants, because he can hire
temporarily those of the landlord. The
customary fees are the payment. To
avoid feeing is really to cheat the serv
ants, who need all they can get, heav
en knows. A chambermaid at the best
hotels receives as wages only about $2
a mouth. Tipping servants iv America
is a regrettable imitation of the Euro
pean custom without its rejtlng ou the
reasonable basis of the foreign institu
tions. — Travel Magazine.
