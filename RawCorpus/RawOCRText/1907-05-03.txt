Electrolysis has been little investi
gated, but now demands greater atten
tion, as it appears that stray currents
in damp soil may endanger buildings
as well as tbe pipes under tbe street.
Experiments by A. A. Knudson, a
New York engineer, at least go to show
that tbe metal embedded in reinforced
concrete is not as perfectly orotected
against corrosion, as has been Eup
posed. Iho tests were made on blocks
of Portland cement sand concrete
three years old, and on blocks of Ho
jendule cement thirty days' old, a
piece of two-inch wrought-iron pipe
being embedded in each block to a
deptb of eight inches. Blocks kept
thirty days in unelectritied sea-water
remained in perfect condition, tbe iron
continuing quite bright. Exposed to
an electric current in sea-water and in
fresh water, blocks of tbe older con
crete became badly cracked, were eas
ily broken, and the pipe- 1 were much
corroded, and blocks of tbe newer
concrete showed cracks as early as the
sixth day.
The yate tree of Western Australia,
growing to a beigbt of 100 feet and a
dTametor of 1% to 3 feet, yields the
strongest timber known. Late tests
showed an average tensile strength of
24, 0 CX) pounds to the square inch, equal
to that of cast iron, and some speci
mens resisted 17}jj tons to tbe square
incb, equal to tbe tensile strength of
wrought iron.

Changes more extraordinary than
have yet come r'roia human invention
are looked upon by Major B. b'. S.
Baden-Powell as possible results soon

Balloons, kites and flying machines
are means by which man can now
ascend into the air or send up In
struments of investigation. Tbe bal
loon is too cumberous and delicate to
be of wide application, yet it is use
ful as a scientific observatory and for
reconnaissance in war. Great im
provement has resulted from engines
.and propellers. T'be French govern
ment made tbe first dirigible airship
'25 years ago, and now it has at least
one that seems a practical air vessel of
war. In Germany Count Zeppelin has
produced a machine that beats all
records in size and speed, At the
other extreme in size are tiny balloons
carrying only self-recording instru
ments, and these have ascended to
B'2l\oo feet, nearly 16 miles. Kites
also have proven useful to the mete
orologist, improved models, retained
by wires, now litt instruments four
miles, and iv large size, have boeu
regularly introduced into military
service. Men were first raised from
tbe ground at Aldershot in 1895, while
in late experiments a height of liOCU
teet ha 3 been reached, the kite-rider
virtually disappearing from view.
The flying machine was an impossibil
ity not long ago, but within two or
three years bas been so developed that
experimenters have sustained them
selves in air for half an hour at a
time. Little remains to do ere man
will have conquered the air.
For his curious theory that bajd
ness is due to lack of upper chest
breathing, Dr. Delos M. Parker, of
the Detroit college of medicine,
claims certification by thousands of
observations during many years. No
victim ot common baldness was found
who breathed properly. The lungs
being imperfectly filled and emptied
and emptied, it is supposed that re
sidual air is lett injthe upper passages
aud develops a soluble poison. This
poison specially affects the scap,
where the skin is practically blood
less, and therefore of low vitality.

BUTLER TELLS OF THE HOLD-UP.
The Plymouth Driver Tells of His]
Adventure with the Robber.
(Sacramento Uee, April 25.)
The; news of the hold-up of the
Plymouth stage yesterday morning,
drew a small-sized crowd to the Old
Pavilion stables last evening to await
the arrival of the vehicle, and a per
snual relation of his experience by
the driver, William liutler. In the
crowd were several old mountain men
who bad been passengers on fctie stage
a day or two previous ou its way to
this city, aud who were as anxious as
anyone else to hear LSiJI relate his
adventure with the highwayman.
Mountain Men on Hand.
They were' quiet. self-rutainßtl old
fellows, these men of the bills, and
every word they uttered bore weight.
'There are fellows up in those hills
'who would stick a man up for 50
cents If they thought be had it," said
one of the Plymouth men, "V c8 i
and they would shoot to get the
money if they wore dry," he added,
"but 1 bet they did not get much the
best of liill tiutler ]ust tbe same.
Just wait aud hoar what be has to
say." Jt was a few miiiutofi after 5
o'clock when the dusty, weather?
worn vehicle dashed iuto tbe
stable, and tbe team brought to
a stop with a jerk. Xbete was a broad
grin on the face of the driver as he
saw so iraiiy ot bis fellow mountain
men awaiting his arrival.
liutlur is a ygung man, perhaps 25
years ot age, quick and ujprt jn all
iiia movements, btonzed by the winds
and storms of his native bills, end
possessing a quiet, self-posesssion
that belied hid exaggerated assertion
ot the fear he felt when facing the
muzzle of tbe robber's pistol. The
quiet twinkle in tbe eyea of the
mountajn men who bad kuown the
young fellow from bis infanny, as be
told of tbe fear, plainly demonstrat
ed how little they believed him
capable of losing his presence ot
mind under any and all circum
stances.
Gun Looked Big.
( 'Did I got held up?" said liutlor,
in answer to a query by one of the
crcwd, as hostlers and all gathered
aiound tbe stage; "well ratbor, and
you bet the gun that followed my
every move for about ten minutes was
about tbe greatest little old cannon
1 over saw in all my lite, "
"Yes, I got held up all right, and
f got quite confidential with the cuss
before the thing was over. 1 bare
wondered at myself ever since that
1 dared to talk §q saucy to him when
be bad tbe gun on me all thu time,
and all cocked and ready for busi
ness.
"1 left Plymouth about 7 o'clcok,
and swung down the canyon at a
pretty lively clip. Just as I reached
the foot ot tbe grade and had crossed
tbe bridgo, 1 heard a voice sing out,
'Hey, tnere, you stop!'
"1 looked around, and there was
tbe cuss squatting by tbe side ot the
road near a pile of big rockß, and
just inside the wire teuue.
"He was partially behind a post,
aud so close to tie grqund that bo
was resting tbe bariel ot bis big
revolver on the lower wire that was
about two feet from the ground. He
was squinting along that barrel at
me. He did not look good, 1 can
tell you that.
Thought It a Joke.
"At first, to t«U the truth, 1
thought it was a joke that come ot
the fellows around Plymouth were
attempting to play on mo, but there
was a business air about the fellow,
and, just tbe same, 1 took no chances
but jammed tbe brake on and brought
tbe stage to a stop.
"Then the fellow said: Toss out
that box.'
"What box?" said 1
The Wells-Fargo box,' said be.
I ain't got no box,' said 1, 'but i
got the mail, it you want that.'
1 don't waut no mci),' said he,
'Don't you carry tbe express!"
'You bet 1 don't,' said i.
No Funny breaks.
"Then he looked at mo a minute,
and said: Well, you get out on tuis
side of that rig, and dou't you ma'«o
any funny break either, if you know
what is good tot you.'
'Look here, pardner, 1 can't get ulf
ou your side, for if 1 do, this team
will run away.'
"Well, you ait still and don't
make any break, and I'll come to
you,' he said, and then keeping the
gun pointed at me all tbe tmio, be
rolled under the wire, jumped to his
feet, camo around tbe heads of the
team, with bis gun pointed at me
all tbe timo, and stopping a few feet
from me on the side 1 was siltiug
said :
'Ain't you got no money at all?'
1 said, 'Yes, a few dollars,' and he
said, "Kork it out.'
"So 1 pulla olf my gloves just as
careless as tnougb 1 was alnne, aud
reached down into my left trousers'
pocket. 1 went deep, 1 tell you, aud
1 gathered up ?14.25 all in small
cbauge, passed it iuto my light hand
and dropped it into bis outstretched
paw. He dropped a half-dollar into
t be dust, aud, keeping the gun on
me, reached down and picked it up.'
"Why didn't you soak him with
the whip when he was bending
down?" asked one ot the bystanders.
"Hell. He Had a Uuu."
"Soak him? Why, hell, he had a
gun, and the business end ot it was
a-lalkiug to me all the time in pretty
plaiu language, retorted butler."
"He was so close at the time, how
ever, that 1 beliovo 1 could have hit
him a pretty heavy clip with a club if
I had one," ho added. "But i guess
it was just as well that did not have
the club.'
"Well, after he got the money, 1
said, 'Say, you ain't going to take all
of it, are you? 1 need some of it for
change on tbe road.'
"1 need it ut great deal more than
you do, 'he answered, aud then be
stowed it away. "Then he said, 'is
that all tbe money you baveV
Saved Thirty-five Dollars.
".Looks like it,' said 1, but just the
same, I bad {35 in gold in my back
pocket. Then'l pulls out an empty
purse that was in the same pocket
with the gold, aud shook it at him
nod said 'See that is empty and no
good to you. '
"Then he made me turn ou( my
front pockets to show him that 1 bad
nothing else of value in them, but he
did not ask me to fool around my
back pockets. Maybe he thought I
had a gun. tlierp, and. would get it into
action with half a chance. But 1 did
not have a gun, and be was ont just
thirty-five plunks iv consequence.
Drive On.
"Then lie said for mo \.o cjrive ou
and not to look back. After _1 hit i
gjt about saventy-llve yards np the
read, 1 looked back, all tbe same, and
lie was crawling under the wire fence
iv tbe came spot he cave from. A
tunny tbiqy about ttie whole thing
was that 1 was not at ail startled
while talking to him, but after 1 sot
down the road a piece Bud 1 got
thinking about tbe way he said, 'Toss
cut that box,' 1 sure got nervous.
"1 drove pretty fast until 1 got to
Vanderpooi's ranch, so as to get some
oue to go back to Plymouth and give
the alarm, but 1 coqld nqt raise sqy :
body there, so I went ou to Uroivns.
There was no one there hut Mrs
Drown and fcbe eaid that she was
ateard to fco to Plymouth with this
fellow on the road. 1 don't know
that i blame her. So 1 hurried on to
b'orest Homo and telephoned back
from tbere ; giving a description ot
the fellow,
Uescribos the iiobimr.
"Ifes, 1 had a pretty good descrip
tion, lie was about my beigbt (5 foot
7 inches) and wa3 heavier, weighing
about 175 pounds, 1 guess, lie wore
a pair of well-worn brogans, a pair of
overalls that l»ad been washed, as
they weie somewhat fnded, a black
coat buttoned up close, and a broad
brimmed, black bat that could be
slouched down over his face.
"1 conld not see any of bis face,
because be bad a rod bandana band
kerchief tied apross it just under bis
eyes and tbis bid his face and hair.
It was tied up so close to his eyes
that be did not have a slit over half
an inch between it and tho edge of
his hat brim^to look out of. 1 judged
he was about 3d years old by bis
actions.
Could Trail in Dew,
"It 1 bad time to go back and get
the sheriff 1 know that we could have
got him, for be came down out of tbe
rocks through tho long grass that was
wet witb dew, and I could have trail
ed him as fost as a horse could run.
Well, 1 got the sheriff and his deputy
at Drytown after tho fellow as quick
as 1 could, and i have not heard
whether they got him or not."

Poisonous Weed Kills Sheep.
Hundreds of sheep on tbe ranges in
the northern part of Nevada, are dy
ing trom the effects of eating a poi
sonous weed, which is quite rank in
that section.
Tho sheep men state that veterinary
surgeons are unable to successfully
compbat thi3 disca-e and that they
may be compelled to drive the sheep
from the ranges.
The vegetation i* in [the form of a
weed aud grows thickly with the
bunch grass, it has a dark"green toli-
Hge and resembles other vegetation
growiug on tbe mountain sides.
When an animal eats any of tbis poi
sonous weed it is seized with pains
and in a short time dies lv spasms.

If every man were tjoncst,

And every one unselfish,
What could we people do?
We'd work but very little,
For we'd all get our due,
If every man were honest,
And every woman $rn,o.
We'd have no "erring brother"
To teach how to be right;
We'd yawn at one another
From morning until night;
And then-00, sainted mother!
We'd all pitch in and light.
For if every "man were honest,
And every woman true,
The world would be most dismal
And everybody blue.
Ob, how we'd hate each other!

Kest is tne great restorer. We lire
our muscles by exercise and then rest
to restore them; yet a great many ot
us do not stop to think how little
rest we give to our stomachs. As b
usual thlcg uo part ot our bodies is
so generally ovei worked ns oui diges
tive organs. A tired and overworked
stomach will give eigns of distress to
which we pay no heed until at last
dyspepsia takes hold. Indigestion is
just a warning, and if we heed the
warning we can easily avoid further
consequences. Kodol is a most thor
ough stomach relief. It digests what
you eat and gives the stomach tbe
needed rest and greatly assists in
restoring it to its normal activity
and usefulness. Kodol is sold nn a
guarautee relief plan. It ia sold here

passed through the school lane the
boys used to call him ''Nosey," and
this made him bo angry that he com
plained to Dr. Butler, who sympathiz
ed and sent for the head boy, to whom
he gave strict Injunctions that the
boys should not say "Nosey" any more.
Next day, however, the exciseman re
appeared, even more angry than be
fore. It seems that not a boy had said
"Nosey," but that as soon as he was
seen coming the boys ranged them
selves In two lines, through which he
must pass, and a!l fixed their eyes In
tently upon his nose. Again Dr. ' Butler
summoned the head boy and spoke
more sharply. "You have no business,"
said he, "to aunoy a man who Is pass-
Ing through the school on his lawful
occupation. I.»on't look at him." But
again the exciseman returned to Dr.
Butler, furious with Indignation, for
this time, as soon as he was seen,
every boy had covered his face with
his hand until he had gone by.— "Life

"I didn't know a marquis ranked so

"Didn't you? Why, a marquis ranks
next to a duke."
He paused to sip his tea and take a

The Tarrot Fish.
There are water parrots as well a 8
land parrots. The parrot fish come
from the tropics, are brilliantly colored
and have beaks something like those
of the parrot, for use in breaking off
the coral shell In order to get at the
living polyp. Not all of them, how
ever, live on animal food, some species
being herbivorous. One species is
found In the Mediterranean* sea, where
It has been known for thousands of
years. The Greeks and Uomans re
garded It for a time as the first of
fishes, and Pliny tells us how It was
Introduced into the Italian sea In the
course of the reign of Claudius. It
was known as the "scarus" by the an
cients, who told some v.o:iJerful sto
ries about Its love. Its wisdom and Its
rumination. Some having a length of
sixteen Inches have been captured
alive.
Dobaque'i Seal.
On the city seal of Dubuque, la., ap
pear the words "La petite uult," and
strangers are always puzzled by them.
Why should Dubuque be called "tho
little night?" It is explained that tho
place originally was settled by an old
miner named Dubuque. When the In
dians granted certain lands to Dubuque
the document was drawn up In French
in Prairie dv Chlen. The clerk who
did the work believed that "la petite
nult" meant "the old miner," and his
mistake has perpetuated a' phrase
which, however pretty, has no signifi
cance in Its present connection.
Blew His Own Horn.
A certain colonel who was In com
mand of the Perthshire yeomanry was
at an evening party in Edinburgh com
plaining loudly of his officers, alleging
that all the duties of the regiment de
volved upon him. "I am," he said, "to
all Intents and purposes my own major,
my own captain, my own lieutenant,
my own cornet." "To say nothing of
being your am trumpeter too," remark
ed a grim old Scottish lady, sotto voce.

Too Much of a Joke.
A harmless practial joke is general
ly appreciated, but when the joke is
carried to the extreme of persoual
unpleasantness, it become a danger
ous pastime. Indeed, this sort of fun
is fraught with danger under any
circumstances. A case id point
cpourred on the 1. and X railroad
early this week on the passenger
train. Narues need not be mentioned,
but the parties are so well-known,
and the matter has been so widely
talked about that we feel the item
should not be entirely ignored.
.Last Sunday the afternoon train on
the 1. & K. was well tilled with
passengers coming to their homes.
There were a nuaibor of prominent
gentlemen, also ladies and child
ren aboard. Just out of lone one
party entered a side room on too
car. The opportunity of a joke
entered the other's mind.
The instant the other saw his friend
out of Eight be closed the dooi ou the
victim, the door had a clasp on the
outside, and this the tormentor push
ed in— looked the door in tact; it
was a temptation to stiong to resist.
No doubt many noticed what had
been done, but tor some cause remain
ed silent, probably reasoning that to
release the prisoner would mean
trouble for an innocent party. After
some minutes bad passed one gentle
man said "Let him out," but without
avail. The train travels slowly and
eomewbeie near Miller's or Keir's
station, a passenger went to the room
and unlocked the the door. Ibe
j iker bad gone to the rear platform
and remained there. As soon as the
lock was sprung giving the victim bia
freedom, out be came and walked
down the aisle toward the end of the
oar. His face white, and he was tbor
ougbly augry. Instinctively he knew
who was at the bottum of his tempor
ary imprisonment, at be reached the
door he noticed the one on the outer
platform and said emphatically "did
you do that?" Instantly the pass
engers were in excitement, and be
tore they realized what was being
done, the two piincijials were engag
ed in a scrimmage. Men rushed to
the rear expecting to see both fall to
the track below. Indeed, when the
conductor arrived and separated them
there was great danger in this respect.
As soon as they were parted each
took a seat ou the car steps, back tv
back, and remained there until
Martells wae reached. liotb men
took the stage to their respective
koines. No further trouble arose and
when they came to Jackson the
following day neither showed marks
of the trouble. The details have
spread far and wide, more ou account

many. Those features the existence of
which can be scientifically proved and
the extent of which can be readily
measured are a high birth rate of gen
ius, a passion for reading, a high di
vorce rate, a low natality, a high death
rate from diseases of the nervons sys

of these traits is obvious. Between
others it Is obscure. But we must re

handsome, being dark witb vefy
beautiful brown eyes. Mr Bradley

somest homes in the city, and there
Mrs Bradley dispenses a delightful
hospitality. She was recently tbe
hostess at a large bridge party, at
which 'the prizes were all exquisite
bits of silver, cutglass or rare china,
and lucky indeed did the fair guests
who won these prizes consider them
selves. Mrs Bradley possesses two
handsome motors and may often be
seen out in her car, as she is an
ardent lover ot- the pursuit. Mrs
Bradley was formerly Miss Mary
farks ot Jackson.

Quit Teaming.
The 1. and E. after csrring on team
ing since the operation of tbe road,
has concluded to quit. The company
has been delivering oil to tbe differ
ent mines near here, and finds the
loss to be much more than it is will
ing to stand. So on May Ist tbat
branoh of the business came to au
end. Tbe horses will be given change
to green grass for a short time, when
it la probable that they will be taken
over tbe mountains, to be used iv
connection with an electrical plnut
now in process ot construction in
Nevada. This change means that tbe
various companies will be compelled
to arrange with private teamster£ for
tbe delivery of oil, the same as for
other kinds of freight. Those who
have eujoyed a "soft" job in the
employ of the railroad for many
months past, must now go back to the
old order nf things.

■Robert Dufrene was in a serious
condition early this week. It will be
remembered that he bad an operation
performed* by which a number ot
glands no tbe side of bis neck were
removed, made necessary by their
diseased condition. He improved to
such au extent that be was able to

as those on the opposite side, com
menced to give him trouble and were
swollen to such nn extent as to cause
him much pain. The last two or
three nights be has rested much
easier, but is not yet out of danger.

A Forgotten Cache of Coin.
A story from Volcano reaches us
showing man's greed. It is somewhat
late iv being made publio, but is true
'nevertheless. Residents of that town
have known an old-timer, Louis Kow
inansott by natue. He was a miner by
occupation and accumulated a small
sized fortune— enough to supply all
bis wants during life. His cabin was
on the roadside, and not far from the
Downs mine, and it was bis home
until he could no longer take care of
liimself. During the past winter he
was compelled to tako refuge iv the
county hospital, and abandoned tbe
piace so many years called home to
any who might wisb to eiitor. Be
sides i be infirmities of old age he bad
partially lost his mind. After leav
ing his cabin which was no longer of
any use to him it was taken possess
ion of by a man called "Dutchy" by
the people of Volcano.
The new tenant was there but a
■ihurt time before he found about
11800 in coin among some old sacks;
coin which had been secteted by the
torruer owner. The recollections ot
this money had completely left Bow
mansutt's mind. Ho left Cuntented as
far as thinking there wag any money
around the old borne. "Dutcby" was
no soonpr in possessiou of bis find
ings than he commenced to invest;
tlrst having a celebration of a liquid
nature all to himself. It did not ail
go tbat way, however, for knowing
ones say tbat he went to lone and
bought a team for 8200. What be did
with tbo balance no one seems to
know, but he did not return to Vol
cano, and bis present whereabouts
are unknown. BowmansuM:, from
ones who know him, say he bears a
good reputation tor honesty. He is
B0 years of age, and on more than one
occasion bas asked superintendent Le
Mom to write to one of the merchants
of Volcano requesting a remittance of
what rnouev be has. on deposit. The
condition of his mind has in no way
improved since becoming a hospital
patient, and it is probably tbat he
will die without ever being able to
realize tbis loss.

No May-Day Demonstration.
The red-flag brigade, who were
planning to make a big demonstration
by a parade on May- Ist, concluded
uot to attempt to carry out tbeir
program. They bad been notified
by tbe sheriff tbat tbe banner of
auarchy would not be permitted as a
feature of tbe parade. A number ol
deputies were selected to suppress anj
demonstration of an incendiary char
acter. The socialists, therefore, con
cluded tbat tbe wbol« affair would be
lifeless without tbe cherished^ sym
bol of tbeir political creed, and re
solved to abandon tbe thing entirely.
There were some red neckties in cvi

any kind, and no excitement.

The Woman
Or the Car
Elliot WalKer
Copyright, 1906, by Homer Sprague
Ladd, the proprietor of the Tama
racks, shook his head with discourag
ing firmness.
"No," he declared decidedly; "I ac
commodate people hero, not automo
biles. First, no shelter for the ma
chine; second, I won't have one round
since my dog was run over; third,
there's no uso of talking. Better go
along."
In the sudden darkness of the sum
mer twilight came a blinding flash,
disclosing more clearly the occupants
of the big touring car— the chauffeur,
gesticulating angrily; two other scowl-
Ing men, a woman and a child.
With a rush of wind the storm broke.
A deafening thunderclap shook the
earth. The rain, almost horizontal in
the flying air, drove n deluge of great
drops under the hastily arranged cov
ers.
"I'm going to get out!" shrilled a
small scared voice. "I want to be In
a house! Mamma, come!"
f A tall figure leaped from the piazza
' of the little hotel, shoved Ladd aside
and held out a pair of shirt sleeved
arms.
"You shall, baby!" he shouted. ''It's
a confounded shame! You, too, mad
am! Let the men take care of them
selves. Hurry, or you'll be drenched!"
"Look out!" cried the mother sharply,
for the child had jumped recklessly.
"Thank you, sir. I feared she would
fall. Yes, I think it Is best. I'll be
right in."
She fumbled for a bag, spoke rapid
ly to oue of her companions and sprang
from the step unassisted to run up the
short path after the uucoated figure,
striding swiftly, with the little girl
clinging to his neck.
Ladd's loud voice came to her ears
above the din.
"You're all welcome, I say. I'll bed
and feed the crowd, but that pesky ma
chine can't lodge at my place. No,
gents. Sorry, but I've sworn to pass
'em along."
"A fine specimen you are to run a
hotel," scolded the man by the driver.
"It's my house," retorted Ladd.
"Well, keep it and be hanged! I
■wouldn't put my head under such a
roof. We'll be here in the morning, old
curmudgeon. Take care of Mrs. Dlx
on. Push her along, Henri. Never
mind speed limits."
A few rattles, a dozen snorting gasps
and the car dashed away through the
mud.
Mr. Ladd, bareheaded and dripping,
gazed after It with a satisfied grin.
"Too bad to break up a party," he
grunted. "This storm will last a good
hour. They'll get a nice twenty mile
trip to Jepworth, splashing soft dirt.
Well, I've got two guests, anyhow, and
tomorrow I make my third nick on old
Hank's tombstone."
He chuckled his way into the barn.

Lois Dlxon sat In the dining room,
a small apartment largely given over
to social usage other than the delights
of the table. A high chair had been
found for Dot, who was assaulting
bread and milk. Seraph Ladd, corpu
lent and apologetic, talked from the ad
jacent kitchen.
"Oh, no, my dear," she was raying.
"The Tamaracks Isn't much of a hotel.
Folks stay here for meals, and we take
In a few transients and occasionally a
regular. The regulars are mostly men
•who come to fish and kill time. There
are good trout In the tamarack swamp
brook, but it's a pesky hole. That man
you saw Is a regular. He has been
here a week."
"I can hardly say I saw him. Every
thing was done so quickly. I'm quite
dry now, and so Is Dot Your husband
doesn't appear to approve of automo
biles," this last sentence with an ag
grieved Intonation.
"He doesn't!" exclaimed Mrs. Ladd
rather warmly. "Jason is good natur
ed about most other things, but after
our dog was knocked across the fence
(poor old thing; he was only gnawing
a bone In the road) Jason swore an
oath never to let a car stop overnight
ag_aln._ So he boarded up the shed.

My, the way some of these people
whiz along a country road is fearful!
lour supper is most ready, Mrs. Dix
on. I take It you are a widow woman,
because" —
"Yes, I've been widowed for five
years," Lois interrupted. "We were
Bimply taking a short pleasure drive.
A slight accident delayed us for an
hour, else we should be at home by
this time. We were making for Jep
worth, where I have n sister."
"I see." Mrs. La'dd began to place
dishes. "I sort of wondered."
"A friend of mine and his brother,
besides the chauffeur," explained Lois,
blushing a trifle. "It did seem queer
that I was left so unceremoniously to
the care of strangers, but I can look
out for myself, and I always go pre
pared for emergencies. Still I should
have thought" —
"Oh, it's the machine every time,"
laughed the old woman. "Men seem to
forget. What with their wrangling and
hurry for cover, you and Dotty were
better out of it."
"Apparently." Mrs. Dixon's tone was
sarcastic. "Ilowever, to let me come
in unattended and to leave all explana
tion to me when he knew I was upset
and trying to calm Dot"— She paused.
Seraph was eying her shrewdly.
"Considerate, I must say," observed
the hostess. "Well, draw up and eat."
"Mercy! You have cooked enough for
three!" Lois laughed outright.
'It's not all for you, my dear. Oui
regular hasn't bad his supper. He
turned up only a few minutes before
you did. I'll tinkle the bell for him.
You dou't mind company, do you? He's
a real nice man, but sort of quiet this
trip. Acts sort of impatient and nerv
ous, too, which Isn't his usual way."
"I must ask you to introduce me,
then. I'll be glad to thank him for
helping us."
The bell rang softly In the hall. Lois,
busying herself ,with her napkin and
with Dot, did not glance at the enter
ing figure.
Mrs. Ladd, impressed by the Impor
tance of the act of introduction, spoke
up smartly.
"Nat, let me make you acquainted
with Mrs. Blakeley— l— l mean Mrs.
Dixon. Mr. Blakeley, Mrs. Dixon. This
is her little girl. Dear, dear! Wasn't
It funny that I should have got you
twisted?"
"Very funny," murmured Blakeley,
bowing and making considerable noise
with his chair. Lois dropped her nap
kin. Dot stared, smiling and nodding.
"Now I've embarrassed you!" cried
Mrs. Ladd, retreating to the kitchen.
"Gracious I" she exclaimed to herself.
"Neither of them can find a word to
say. I guess I'll shut this door or they
may hear me giggle."
The silence was broken by Dot
"You've got whiskers," she remarked,
with complacence. "That's why! Didn'l
you know me?"
"No," said the man thickly. "I hadn't
my glasses on. I recognized no one. I
put that wrap over your head, dumped
you in a chair and called Mrs. Ladd. I
didn't know you, dear" —
"And you've put on a coat," went on
his Inquisitor, surveying him affection
ately. "I liked you better with Just a
mustache. It seems ever so long since
you came to see mamma."
"Hush, Dot," said her mother softly.
"But he used to bring me candy," per
sisted the child. "Mr. Barker doesn't.
I like Mr. Blakeley best. Don't you?"
Lois' cheeks crimsoned.
"It's bedtime, dear. Mrs. Ladd will
take you to the room. I'll be up in a
minute. Be a good girl and run out to
the kitchen for her."
Dot tiptoed to Blakeley's chair.
"Good night," she said coyly and put
up her lips.
The man kissed her tenderly, with a
great lump In his throat. lie had hoped
for many good night caresses from this
little one, but that hope no longer ex
isted. As she disappeared be gazed
steadily at the woman opposite.
"Let us have it over, Lois," he blurt
ed. "I heard the news a month ago.
Believe me, my dear, I shall try to
think only of your happiness. Barker
will be a very happy man."
"Not with me, Nat."
"What! Do you mean"—
"I mean that I do not Intend to be
come Mrs. Barker. I have not yet given
him my answer. lie will get It tomor
row when he returns with his automo
bile. You have been misinformed."
Her eyes shone into his as he strain
ed forward, eager, transformed with a
sudden Joy.
"Lois!" he cried. "Oh, my love, tell

me, id there a chance for— yes, yes,
you are crying, dear!"
"My introduction wasn't so far
wrong, after all, Jason!" beamed Se
raph Ladd the next day. "I wonder
what Mrs. Dixon thought when I call
ed him 'Nat,' so familiar? She says she
will be Mrs. Blakeley the next time I
see her."
The Ownership of a Patent.
Suppose that a prior patent Is in
fringed and no way is seen to avoid
Infringement by changing the product
or the process or the machine so as
not to embody the principle of a pat
ented invention. The simplest way, of
course, would be to buy the patent "If
the patent cannot be bought, but a
fraction of the patent can be obtained,
no matter bow small a fraction— say
one-tenth of the entire right in the pat
ent — the owner of the one-tenth would
be just as well off as the owner of the
nine-tenths. The courts have held that
a patent Is not like the capital stock
of a corporation and that the owner of
more than one-half of the title to the
patent has no claim upon the owner of
less than one-half. Each is at liberty
to do with his portion what he pleases
and cannot be made to account to the
other. The owner of one-tenth may
make ten times aa much out of the pat
ent as the owner of nine-tenths, be
cause of his greater business ability
or greater capital or for other similar
reasons, and it would not be equitable
to make him turn over nine-tenths of
his profits to the other owner.— Edwin
J. Prindle in Engineering Magazine.
A Choice of Evils.
Landlady— Would you advise me to
send my daughter to a cooking school
or to a music school? Boarder (reflec
tively)— Well, I think I'd send her to a
cooking school. It may be more fatal
In its results, but it Isn't anything like
so noisy.
How They Get In.
Knicker — Are children allowed In
your flat? Pocker-No. We brought
ran in under the head of musical in
struments.—New York Sun.
"Bells of Shandon."
la one of the dormitories of the
Irish college at Rome there is a spare
on the wall left uuimpered and un
painted, whatever repairs the rest 01
the room may undergo, for there, care
lessly scrawled, is the lirst rough draft
of Father Trout's "Bells of Shandon."
Studies teach not their own use
that is, a wisdom without them and

Nature's Way' Is Best.
The function strengthening and tissue
building plan of treating chronic, linger-
ing ana obstinate cases of disease as pur-
sued by Dr. Pierce, is following after
Nature's plan of restoring health.
Ho uses natural reined that Is
extracts from native medicinal roots,
prepared by processes wrought out by
■the expenditure of much time" and
money, without the use of alcohol, and
by skillful combination in just tho right
proportions.
Used as ingredients of Dr. Picrce's
Golden Medical Discovery. Black: Cherry-
bark, Queen's root. Golden Seal root,
liloodroot and Stone root, specially exert
their influence in cases of lung, bronchial
and throat troubles, and this " Disco v-
Er.v is, therefore, a Boverelgu remedy
for bronchitis, laryngitis, chronic coughs,
catarrh and kindred ailments.
Tho above native roots also have the
strongest possible endorsement from the
leading medical writers, of all the several
schools of practice, for tho cure hot only
of the diseases named above but also for
indigestion, torpor of liver, or bilious-
ness, obstinate constipation, kidney and
bladder troubles and catarrh, no matter
where located.
You don't have to tako Dr. IMcrce's
say-so aljno as to this; what ho claim.;
for his "Discovery" is backed up by the
writings of the most eminent men in the
medical profession. A request by postal
card or letter, addressed to Dr. It. V
Pierce, Buffalo, N. V., for a little book
of extracts from eminent medical au-
thorities endorsing tho Ingredients of hi.>
medicines, will bring a little book free

needing a good, safe, reliable remedy of
known composition for tho cure of almost
any old chronic, or lingering malady.
