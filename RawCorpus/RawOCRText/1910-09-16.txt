Journey for Pleasure
Gustive Haun, a well known brewer
of Bodie, Nevada, accompanied by
Jooh Broad, who are making a journey
from Bodie to San Francisco in a two
horse team, arrived in Jackson Mon
day evening, and went into camp
along the Sutter road, just north of
this city. The trip was started merely
as a novelty and thus far the travelers
express much satisfaction with their
journey.
Haun informed us when queried as
to the conditions of the roads, that
the road on the other side of the sum
mit was all he could wish to haveit be,
but he added on this side of the sum
mit for a stretch of 15 miles, the high
way is almost impossible on account
of the large boulders and deep wash
outs.
The trip was started on August 2nd,
and no accident encountered on the
way.

Hurt in Mine
Arthur Koberts, who was unfortu
nate enough to nave his left leg
broken in the Fremont mine a week
ago, is improving nicely in the Sutter
Creek sanitarium.
Roberts was working on the BUO
level, when a large boulder fell out
the hanging wall, striking him on the
leg and breaking the bone just above
the knee. The miner was hurried to
the surface, and taken to the sani
tarium, where Dr. Goodman dressed
the injury, and relieved the patient of
much agony.
Improving Nicely
Mrs Wm. Green sr.. wife of the
proprietor of the Globe hotel, was
taken seriously ill last wqek, and when
Dr. Gall was summoned he found his
patient suffering from an attack of
typhoid fever. The patient is con
fined to her bed at the home of C. D.
Peek, a son-in-law, who resides in
South Jackson. . '
The doctor secured the services of
Miss Josephine Cassella, a professional
trained nurse, formerly of Jackson,
but who now makes her home in San
Francisco. The doctor informs ' us
that his patient is improving nicely,
and says the critical stages of the dis
ease are past, and he looks for a com
plete recovery, which will of course be
a matter of time.
Leg Broken
Mrs Hicks, who resides on Broad
way in this city, had the misfortune
to fall and break her leg last week.
The lady, who is nearly 60 years old,
tripped, and in falling, cracked the
bone in the right leg, just above the
ankle.
Mrs Hicks was suffering much pain
when Dr. Gall was summoned, but
after careful attention, the doctor left
his patient resting as comfortable as
could be expected.
Fully Recovered
Miss Eda' Piccardo, who was unfor
tunate enough to fracture two ribs in
her right side about a week ago, has
completely recovered and left Jackson
Thursday morning for San Francisco,
where she is employed as a dress
maker, in a fashionable store. The
young lady struck her side against the
corner of a table and injured the ribs
which caused her intensd Dam. Dr.
Gall was called and -rendered profes
sional services.
Investigating Affairs
J. P.. Grey, representing the board
of trade of San Francisco, came up
last Friday to investigate the, affairs
of C. Giovannoni & Co., the general
merchandise firm of Jackson, whose
doors were voluntarily closed last
week. Mr Grey's business is to make
a thorough investigation of the assets
and liabilities of the broken firm, and
report the result to the board of trade
for the information of the creditors
concerned. The first four days were
spent is looking over the books, as
certaining therefrom the amount owing
to and by the firm. This was finished
.Tuesday, and it is said the expert is
well satisfied witn the showing thus
far. As it stands the asset 3 should
cover the liabilities, with a reasonable
margin for uncollectable book debts.
Mr Grey commenced Wednesday morn
ing to take an inventory of the stock,
machinery, and other assets.
Enjoyable Dance
An indoor dance and picinic was
given by California parlor, No. 161 N.
D. G. W., at Torres hall, in Amador
City on Saturday, September y, for
the benefit of homeless children.
Fancy dancing and other specialties
were interesting features of the occas
sion. Ice cream, cake, candies and
other refreshments were served.
Music was furnished by the Amador
City band and orchestra. Many people
from neighboring towns were present.
Happy Coupie Return
•Mr and Mrs Stanley James returned
to their home in Jackson, after spend
ing a delightful honeymoon trip to
Sacramento and other points.
The happy pair were the recipients
of many pretty and valuable presents,
part of which were, a lovely dinner
set, elaborately decorated, a salad >et,
of very pretty design, and a beauti
fully decorated water set. The bride
received considerable silverware and
linen.
The couple returned on Wednesday
evening, and were accorded a most
hearty welcome by a large crowd.
The serenaders, after creating all the
noise they could, left their various pots
and cans in the street, nearly block
ading the thoroughfare.
Had Fine Trip
W. J. Peters returned to Jackson
from a much enjoyed vacation spent at
Palo Alto, Alameda, and San Fran
cisco. Peters is employed aa a phar

HAS FAILD TO
PAY LICENSE
Larae Amount Lost by the County
A striking; example of loss of revenue
through neglect to collect county licen
ses has just come to our notice, and
which calls loudly for redress even at
this late date. John Ratto, proprietor
of the moving picture show in Jackson,
in addition to his show at county seat
has been operating branch shows for
the past two years in Sutter Creek
and Amador City, usually playing two
nights in each place. The license tax
for the Jackson show under the city
ordinance is 825 per quarter, and .this
tax has been faithfully collected by the
city officials. For the outside shows a
license tax is required at the rate of
$2.50 for each performance, or 810 per
week, collectable by tax collector U.
S. Gregory, who is ex-offlcio license
collector. Inquiry at the sheriff's
office shows that the matter of collect
ing this transitory class of license is
left largely to the sheriff's deputies in
the respective outside town. We sim
ply mention this fact, although it has
little or no bearing upon the merits of
this story — the tax collector is respon
sible on his official bonds for the faith
ful collection of this revenue.
Now, from the outset there has been
a disposition in county affairs to favor
Ratto in the matter of license tax,
without any excuse being given there
for. He was singled out for favor, and
that is all we can make out of it, and
our readers must judge for themselves
as to the motive.
The records show that Ratto paid
for two licenses in July, 1908, and one
in October of the same year, making
87.50 all told. At the meeting of the
supervisors in December, 1908, the fol
lowing appears on the minutes :
It was moved and carried by the un
animous vote of the board that John
"Ratto be granted a free show license
in Amador county for the period of
three months.
In May, 1909, we find pnother entry
on the minutes to this effect :
'.-John'Ratto of Jackson, Cai., ap
peared before the board and asked the
board for a free show license in Ama
dor Co. it was moved and carried by
unanimous vote of the board that said
John Ratto be and he is hereby
granted a free show license in Amador
county for the period of six months.
We have no hesitation in saying that
these so-called free permits were with
out legal authority, being without any
legitimate basis. But for the peiiod in
cluded within these permits the super
visors and their legal adviser must bear
the responsibility for the loss of rev
enue. Even conceding their validity,
the last permit expired in November,
1909, but Ratto appears to have con
tinued right along in the show business
without contributing in the way of li
cense payments for the support of the
government. In June, 1909, an oppo
sition moving picture was started in
Sutter Creek, and the proprietors, with
the Ratto example before them, ap
plied for and was granted a free li
cense for five months, which would ex
pire on even date with the Ratto per
mit. This was supposed to be the last
of the free show business. But we can
not find any record of the payment of
county license by Ratto since, although
continuing in business.
Assuming that Ratto has conducted
his outside show four nights per week
from the date of the first free permit,
the account stands thus :
Dec 1908 to Sep. 1910, 90 weeks,
at $10 per week - - - $900.00
Less 39 weeks free permit,B39o
By cash, 3 licenses - 7.50.
397.50
Balance lost to county. - $502.50
Now this is a serious matter for Am
ador taxpayers who cannot get out of
their taxes by the same route, and who
have to make good the loss. Sheriff
Gregory says it is not too late to col
lect the balance due. All right, a suit
to recover from the delinquent would
help to lift the burden from officials
concerned. Here is one solitary in
stance of a loss of hundreds of dollars
of revenue. Who is to make good, those
concerned or the general taxpayers?

Skipped Out.
Cleveland Jones left Saturday for
Sacramento, to which point his wife
went a few days before. He left
saying that he intended to return in a
few days. It is not believed, how
ever, that he is likely to come back of
his own accord. Many creditors are
left to mourn. He borrowed all he
could, and contracted debts in a num
ber of business houses besides. He is
a smooth and plausible talker, and
played upon the kind-hearted and
sympathetic business men. His debts
will foot up several hundred dollars all
told. There is some talk of bringing
him bank by legal steps, but whether
it will materialize we cannot say. He
has been here some six months or
more, engaged in singing at the mov
ing picture show a part of the time,
and employed in other ways. How
long will Jackson continue in the
"Easymark," list to be victimized
after this fashion.
Died Suddenly
Father Laffan went to lone on Tues
day last, and officiated at the funeral
services of George Leary, who died
suddenly on Sunday morning last, at
Kentfield, where he had gone to meet
warden Hoyle and family of San
Quentin prison. Leary was employed
at the prison as a guard, and was act
ing as the warden's coachman. He
was stricken with heart disease just
as the party had seated themselves in
the carriage, and fell back dead into
the arms of Mrs Hoyle.
Wed In Jackson
Joseph Casella of Amador City and
Miss Frances M. Garbarini of Jack
son, were married at the parsonage of
St. Patrick's church on Sunday morn
ing, at 10 a. m., by Father Gleason.
The couple were attended by Virgilio
Garbarini of Jackson and Mary Smith,
also of this city as witnesses.
Mr and Mrs Casella left on a
wedding tour, and will be gone several
weeks. They will make their future
home in Amador, where he is at pres
ent employed in a mine.
Ready for Business
The furniture for Dr. Franklin's
office and rooms in the Kay building
arrived on Tuesday from San Fran
cisco. He has a fine outfit of instru
ments and all the accessories of his
profession, and has resolved to es
tablish himself in the practice of
medicire and surgery in this city.
Clergyman Leaves
Rev. Thos. H. Nicholas and wife
left for Pacific Grove on Thursday
last, where the minister will attend
the annual conference in session there.
Rev. Nicholas does not expect to
return to Jackson for another term,
and has everything packed, ready for
shipment to the charge to which he
may be appointed. Mrs Nicholas will
not return to this city after the con
ference, but will visit friends and
relatives along the coast. The
clergyman, however, will return and
most likely preach one more sermon
before leaving Jackson for his new
field.
Home From Vacation
W. H, Greenhalgh returned from
his vacation of a couple of weeks' to
San Francisco and other points. He
got home last Saturday, and had a
most enjoyable time. He is busy
keeping up with the rush of work in
school superintendent's office incident
to the opening of the school term in
nearly all the districts last Monday.
IN. D. G. W. Celebrate
Last Friday afternoon, Ursula par

MINE NEWS
ALONG LODE
Interesting Accounts of
Mines Located In
Amador Co.
Alpine
operations at this mine, located in
the town of Plymouth, are proceeding
at a satisfactory gait, under the per
sonal supervision of Mr Henry, the
president of the company. Fifteen
men are employed in clearing around
the shaft and other preliminary work.
Material and supplies are being re
ceived on the ground. The company
is taking hold in a manner that shows
they mean business. The people of
the old town are elated over this re
vival of the mining industry right at
their doors—something they have been
a stranger to for twenty years. There
is the utmost confidence expressed that
the mine will turn out a paying pro
perty.
Amador Limerock Company
A crew of men was started to work
at the limestone deposits of this com
pany in Mt. Echo district, last Mon*
day, under the direction of T. Geb>
hardt. All necessary implements are
on the ground, also shelter am l sleep
ing bunks for the employes. It is the
intention to employ eight men in strip
ping the ground and opening up the
deposit at several points along its
course, with the view of ascertaining
as far as possible its extent and
quality. This preliminary work will
take about two months to complete.
Central Eureka
It is reported that the regular ledge
was encountered early last week in
the 2800 level of this mine. This is
not to be identified in any way with
the small streak of rich ore reported
some time back, and which had a
boosting effect upon the stock, which
fell back to its former figures as soon
as the excitement had subsided.  The
ore body which was reported last week
was toward the east, and supposed to
be a continuation of the vein opened
up in the South Eureka. If this be
so, it is a discovery of great value, as
suming that the rock is anything like
that found in its. neighbor to the
south. We have learned nothing de
finite since as to the quality or size of
the ledge.
A Sample of Intelligence
Senator Caminetti must have a very
poor opinion of Amador county when
he takes the position that out of half a
million visitors to the Panama Exposi
tion none of them would be attracted
to his district. There is not a better
mining county in the state than Ama
dor. And what is the matter with El
Dorado? Calaveras needs more popu
lation and has the homes for them, and
so has Alpine and Mono. There is not
a district in the state which needs a
large immigration and which has more
to offer the immigrant than in the
tenth senatorial district. It has some
of the best water power in the state ;
it has mines; it has beautiful valleys;
it has attractions of all kinds, and no
man knows that better than Senator
Caminetti. We are satisfied that
when the people of the tenth get a
chance to register their views on the
state fair appropriation next Novem
ber, Senator Caminetti will find him
self as much in a minority in the dis
tric as he was in the senate Tuesday.
And he should be.— Sac. Union.
School Term Opens
Jackson's public school term opened
on Monday last, and the attendance
was well up to any previous year.
Two hundred and eighty children re
ported for enrollment on the first day
and many more are expected to enroll
in the near future.
Miss MeCaskey teaches the first and
second grades, Mrs- Calwdell teaches
the second and third grade, Miss Bada
racco teaches .the fifth, Miss Conners
the fourth, Miss Louise McLaughlin
the sixth, Miss Annie McLaughlin,
teaches the seventh, and Mr Whylie,
who is principal of the school,
teachers the eighth grade.
Miss Amy Clark teaches her
scholars, who reside near Jackson
Gate in the first, second, third, fourth
and fifth grades. • The department
was organize to save the younger
scholars the long trip into Jackson.
Their school room is located just be

THE MAINE ELECTION
The political outlook, judging from the result of the
election in Maine last Tuesday, is anything but encouraging
from a republican standpoint. The democrats elected Plaisted
governor, two out of four congressmen, and claim the legis
lature on joint ballot, which will give them one United States
senator from that state. Not for thirty years have the demo
crats scored such a success in that state. The republicans
while expecting a reduction iv the party vote, were surprised
at the magnitude of the democratic victory. Opinions differ
as to the cause of this heretofore reliable republican state
breaking loose from its old-time political moorings. The
, situation is similar' to that which preceded the election of
Cleveland in 1884. The long period of uninterrupted ascen
dancy of any party gives birth in the minds of many to a
desire for a change. The fact that the country has enjoyed
prosperity during this period is not strong enough to over
come this yearning for change, particularly when fanned by
partisan appeals that a change of administration will bring
better times. The factional strife within the republican ranks
represented by.the struggle between the insurgents and regu
lars, has probably dampened the party spirit more than all
the efforts of democracy combined. When one wing of a po
litical party takes issue with the controlling faction on a
vital question of policy, like the tariff for instance, the effect
cannot be otherwise than bewildering and harmful. In face
of this warning voice from Maine, it behooves republicans
to stop their bickerings, and work harmoniously to carry the
November elections. The paramount question now is, not
whebiier insurgent or regulars shall control the republican
party, but whether republicans or democrats shall control
the next congress. The drift of the elections so far is adverse
to the party now in control. There is a feeling abroad that
a change in party majority in congress would make little
difference to the toiling masses anyway, and would not dis
turb industrial conditions. That was the kind of talk they
gave us in the Cleveland campaigns. But it is matter of
history that it did make a big difference. And if the experi
ment is repeated, it will work still greater mischief than it
did twenty years ago.
That senator Caminetti of this district opposed bonding the
state for five million dollars in aid of the Panama Exposition
to be held in San Francisco in 1915 is well known. The mo
tives prompting his opposition are not so clear. We do not
believe his stand on this proposition is in line with the pre
vailing sentiment of his constituency. The Sacramento
Union intimates that he explained his opposition vote by
stating that his senatorial district, removed from the. main
lines of travel, could hardly expect to reap much advantage
from the vast crowds that will be attracted to California dur
ing the fair. We take no stock in that argument. Amador
county, notwithstanding its premier rank in Mother lode
mining, is a comparatively little known region. Its mineral
and other resources are not properly appreciated by the out
side world. We have made no particular efforts to put the
county on the map as it were, so that the stranger may take
notice to the extent of sharing in its development. It is just
such breaks as Caminetti is reported to have made before the
assembled lawmakers that help to keep Amador in the back
ground. A niining man, who has had thirteen years' ex
perience in the mines of Montana and Utah — two noted
mining states— visited Amador county for the first time re
cently. He was struck with the tremendous resources lying
dormant, and candidly admitted that we have the finest min
eral country in the United States, and that he had about
wasted thirteen years through not having reached here be
fore. Instances of a like complimentary nature are constant
ly occurring. It is therefore to be regretted that one who has
lived here all his life should convey the impression that Am
ador county has little to gain from such an enterprise as the
San Francisco world's fair promises to be. The mother lode
counties ought to, and doubtless will, be represented at that
exposition by an exhibit of mineral products that will com
mand attention from mining men and capitalists, who will
be attracted from every part of the world. This proposed
exposition should be Amador's opportunity, and her citizens
will be remiss in their duty if they fail to make the most
of it.

way of the principal line, and it sup
ports the aeronaut suspended in a
basket. A man may safely reach
several hundred yards above the earth.
Communication may be kept up by
telephone, or by paper messages sent
up the cord by the wind, or down by
small weights.
A novel German shoe has partitions
to separate the toes. These terminate
in soft pads pressing against the foot,
so that the thrust in walking is taken
at the base of the toes instead of the
point. Jamming of the toes into the
toe of the shoe is prevented. It is ex
pected that the deforming of the feet
now so common will be avoided by
this arrangement, and that walking
will be more comfortahle.
To keep hailstones for winter study.
Prof. Weinberg, of Tomsk, Siberia,
encloses them in a little cell with
double walls, holding ice and copper
sulphate. August hailstones so pre
served were examined under the micro
scope in the cold of ' December. He
suggests immersing in oil to prevent
agglomeration.
Electric plowing outfits, each capable
of plowing from 10 to 25 acres daily
with the small plow and 25 to 35
acres with the larger one, are a Ger
man novelty. A single motor, of 38
to 72 horse-power, is used, and a com
plete equipment includes a motor
truck, driving rope, anchor vehicle,
automatically moving rope supports,
plow, electric cable and cable car.
The 1000 to 3000 feet of specially
armored rubber- covered cable supply
ing the current is carried on an out
rigger of the truck or in the greater
lengths on the cable car. The electric
motor on the truck can* be coupled
either to the rear wheels of the vehicle
or to the drum driving the rope, and a
special device automatically stops the
the motor if the tension on the rope
becomes excessive. A pulley on the
anchor vehicle is relieved of the load
of the rope when the plow moves back
to the motor truck. This slackening
of the rope causes the pulley's rota
tion to act upon the anchor vehicle,
and to move it automatically forward
to the next furrow-space. Electric
plowing is one of the steps in the
transformation of German farming by
the central power station.
Some strange Java mosquitoes have
been discovered that do not bite, but
have the curious habit of "milking"
ants in much the same way that ants
obtain honey-dew from alphides. Ed-
ward Jacobson has found that mos
quitoes, of the species Harpagomyia
splendens visit trees frequented by
ants of the species Cremastogaster
difermis. Tickling the head of an
ant with its forelegs and antennae,
one of the mosquitoes causes the ant
to emit a drop of fluid, which is
promptly sucked up by the bandit as
the victim of the hold-up is released.
Two other Java diptera have been
noticed feeding from the ant secretion
in the same manner.
Bacteria that survive in sunlight are
killed by the ultra-violet rays from
mercury-vapor lamps with quartz
tubes. Two French investigators re
port that the killing is not due to the
formation of hydrogen peroxide or
other chemical poison, but to the direct
action of ultra-violet rays of extreme
ly short wave-length. Such rays,
abundant in artificial light from the
quartz lamps near at hand, are filtered
from sunlight by passage through the
atmosphere
Identification of persons by the vein
patterns on the back of the hands is
claimed by Prof. Tamassia, of the
University of Padua, to be the best
and surest of known methods. The
patterns remain unchanged during
life, and are never nlike in two per
sona, the diversity being nlmo3t in
credible. Even if the vein 9on two
right handa should seem to be very
similar, the patterns on the .left
hands of the snmo persons will filiow
great divergence. Six classes of vein
patterns are reeogniza'J, and show a
surprising range from n single layer
vein having two or thrae short
branches to groups of figures of great
complexity. If necessary, the veins
can be marked with dark pigment so
as to show very conspicuously in
photographs. The records of the
rogues' gnllevy formerly consisted of
front and profile photographs of
criminnls, but I3ertillon gave greater
accuracy by adding a system of
measurement of head, forearm,
fingers, etc., and Galton afterward
introduced the plan of preserving
finger-prints, which show skin cor
rugations never alike in any two per
sons. Until recently the peculiarities
of the vein patterns wero overlooked.
The improved hydroplane of Sir
John Thornycroft, English nnval ar
chitect, overcomes the difficulties of
the original by retaining the shape of
an ordinary boat so nearly as to pass
through the water in a similar manner
at ordinary speeds. The shape of the
bottom is sufficiently changed to cause
the vessel to skim the water at high
speeds, the weight then resting on a
small portion of tnc length amidships.
The boat is 23 fejt long, 6 feet beam
and 2J2 feet deep, and has exceeded
31 knot 3 under poor conditions. From
torpedo boat experience, it is esti
mated that a hydroplane of 53 feet,
\yith displacement of 10 tons and a 650
horse-power motor, should have a
speed of 45 knot?, while 60 knots
should bo attained with a boat 110 feet
long.
Animal life, existing under a pres
sure of s>£ tons to the square inch,
has been found in the Tonga basin
near New Zealand, at a depth of 4%
miles. The greatest ocean depth
known is les3 than a mile deeper.
Died Suddenly
Only a few days ago, Miss Helen
Prichard went to the Flacerville sana
torium for treatment for what was at
the time considered gastric trouble
of the stomach. Examination by the
physicians, however, led them to be
lieve that the real cause of trouble
was an affected appendix, and the
patient was so informed. She did not
think her affliction was of sufficient
importance to warrant ar. operation,
and declined to submit to that ordeal.
She improved, and was apparently
getting well, when Monday she was
taken suddenly worse and at an early
hour Tuesday both Drs. Rantz and
Recker3 were hurriedly called. .But it
was too la f e to afford her relief, and
the young lady passed away at about
5:45 o'clock,
Her death was due to breaking of
the appendix and consequently poison
ing of the entire system. An opera
tion even at the time she went to the
sanatorium might not have proven
successful in saving her life.
The deceased was one of the most
upright and popular young women of
this community, and her death will be
universally regretted. She was serv
ing in the capacity of bookkeeper for
the El Dorado Water and Deep Gravel
Mining Company, which position she
had held for some years past. She
was a native of Sutter Creek, Ama
dor county, 32 years, 3 months, and
6 days old. Her father, Elias Prich
ard, is dead, but she leaves a mother
two sisters and one brother, also an
uncle, four aunts and grandmother
living in this county, Sacramento and
San Francisco.— Nugget.
Pioneer At Celebration
Charles Peters, the 86-year-old
pioneer, returned from San Francisco
on Saturday last. He went to the city
to take part in the big celebration of
Admission day, but came back con
siderably disappointed. He took no
part in the procession. To get in line
with the marching column was out of
the question fo>- a man of his years^
as it required being on his feet for
seven hours continuously, and al
though rugged and tough for his age
he was not equal to this strain. The
truth is he got down to the city too
late. He reached San Francisco
Wednesday evening, unaccompanied by
any one, and without any previous
notification to the committee in
charge. By that time, of course, all
arrangements for the procession had
been made, and no change in the de
tails could be tolerated. In this way
the old M9er from Amador county was
left out. not out of discourtesy to
him, but as an inevitable sequence of
being too late for the fair. He was
shown every consideration under the
circumstances, a room being secured
for him at the hotel, and his every
want provided tor. It was really un
safe for him to get into the crowded
streets, his hearing and sight bc?ng
somewhat feeble. It is said that one
of the first breaks hu muric on retch
ing San Francisco was to attempt 'o
walk through a mirror, under the im
pression that the image reflected there
in was the actual roadway.

CANT BE SEPARATED
Some Jackson People Have Learned
' How to Get Rid of Both
Backache and kidney ache are twin
■ brothers.
You can't separata them.
And you can't get rid of the back
ache until you cure the kidney ache.
If the kidneys are well and strong,
the rest of the system is pretty sure
to be in vigorous health.
Doan's kidney pills make strong,
healthy kidneys.
T. J. Seymour, 51 Pitt street, Jack
son, Cal., says: "Over twenty years
ago I was injured and at that time my
kidneys were affected. My back grew
weak and ached a great deal, and the
kidney secretions annoyed me by
their irregularity in passage. These
difficuhies clung to me until 1 began
the usa of Doan's kidney pills, pro
cured from the City Pharmacy. Since

minutes on two occasions, returning
each time with a fresh supply of coin,
which he also lost.
Next morning Williams found that
the store had been burglarized during
the night and the cash register rifled
of all its contents— about $6, Nothing
olse had been disturbed. The stranger
appeared on duty that morning as us
ual. During the day some jewelry was
missed. Constable Kelley suspected the
stranger, and finding him at a business
place searched him and found the
jewelry— a watch, ring, etc— in his
pockets. He wa arrested, and brought
to Jackson by deputy Connors the
same evening, and lodged in jail. He
owns up to the affair. He is caid to
bj highly connected, and efforts have
been made to keep the matter as

Big Financial Scheme
A big trust deed, embracing probab
ly trom 50 to 60 pages ol type written
matter when spread upon the records,
was filed for record with the county
recorder last Wednesday. It is from
the Kennedy Extension Mining Com
pany, operating the Muldoon mine
near Jackson, which company is in
volved in a big damage suit against
the Argonaut Company, to the Mer
cantile Trust Company of San Fran
cisco. It conveys all the mining pro
perty held by the Kennedy Extension
Company to the trust company, to
secure the payment of bonds to be is
sued by said mining company to the
tune of $250,000, bearing interest at 6
per cent. This method of raising
money by the issuance of bonds is
somewhat new to Amador county. An
erroneous impression exists to the
effect that the Mercantile Trust Com
pany which figures in the transaction,
is responsible for the payment of the
bonds, if issued. This is not so. The
trust company will not have to put up
one dollar, in the event of the mining
company failhng to meet its obliga
tions. The San Francisco company is
merely the trustee, and only obligates
itself to foreclose, in the event of the
non-payment pf bonus or interest
thereon, on petition of a certain per
centage of the bond holders requesting
such action. It is merely an ordinary
transaction in the trust line as far as
the Mercantile Trust Company is con
cerned. If in the event of foreclosure,
the property covered by the trust deed
is insufficient to realize sufficient to
pay the bonded indebtedness, etc., the
bondholders, and not the trust com
pany, will have to stand the loss, or at
least look to other sources than the
trust company to make good the de
ficiency.

Cruisers at Work
A force of men are still at work in
the mountains cruising the timber in
the hands of private parties, and also
alone the edges of the government
reserve in this county. It is said the
work is being done in the interest of a
capitalist named Ruggles, who has
largo lumbering interests in the
middle west, as well as on the Pacific
const, lie is said to have acquired
considerable timber land in this
county already, and is looking around
to enlarge his holdings. The cruisers
are favorably impressed with .the
valuable tract of timber lands in the
eastern part of the county. It is
bound to come into market within a
few years. Whether these who are
surveying this timber belt have any
definite idea of finding an outlet for
the product we cannot say. It ' is
rumored that the protected new power
plant above the head of the present
Standard Electric Company's ditch
may help the development of the
lumbering interests, by supplying
power for removing the logs. There
are from 15 to 20 men engaged in the
cruising of timber lands in this sec
tion.

Mrs. A/lclntyre
Mrs Alurina Mclntyre, who passed
away at her home in Volcano on
August 29, was born in the state of
New York, on March 3rd, 1810. She
moved with her parents, Asa and
CJarisa Burt into Chemung county,
N. V., when that part of the state
was first being settled.
She was married to William Mc
lntyre on September Ist 1845.
Mr Mclntyre came to Californa in
March' 1852, expecting to remain only
a couple of years, but instead of re
turning to New York, he sent for his
family, which at that time consisted of
his wife and daughter, who is now
Mrs Benj. Ross, a little son having
died after Mr Mclntyre's departure
for the goldfields. Another daughter,
now Mrs Finley Goodman, was born to
them after Mrs Mclntyre arrived in
California.
Mrs Mclntyre came by way of
Panama, crossing the Isthmus by rail
shortly after the road, was completed,
and continued on her journey by
steamer to San Francisco, thence to
Sacramento by steamer and from
there to Volcano by stages, arriving
about the 28th of December, 1859. She
was known for a number of years, by
the old settlers as "Lady Me."
From childhood, she was very in
dustrious, and when not engaged in
her household duties she was ever
busy with her needle,- making em
broidery or patchwork quilts, the latter
being her favorite pastime, she hav
ing pieced and completed more than
ono hundred patchwork quilts, and

Your committee appointed to pre
pare resolutions expressive of the
sentiment of the parlor upon the death
of George P. Bonnefoy respectfully
submit the following:
Whereas— Almighty God in his om
nipotence, has seen fit to remove from
our midst our brother, Geo. P. Bonne- 1
foy, promoting him to a seat in the
Heavenly Parlor on high ; and Whereas
we realize that by his untimely death,
a place has been left vacant in our
Parlor which will be hard to fill;
Therefore be it resolved, that while j
we humbly bow to the Devine Will,'
we do deeply and sincerely deplore the I
loss of our brother, whose uprightness
as a citizen, and a Native Son, will
ever serve as an inspiration to us, and
be cherished, in loving rememborance,
and let it further be resolved that we
offer our heart felt sympathy to his
bereaved relatives in this their great
loss, and be it further resolved that
these resolutions be spread upon the
minutes of this parlor, that a copy be
sent to the sorrowing relatives, and to j
the Amador Ledger for publication.
That our charter be draped in mourn
ing for a period of 30 days. '

The post office department has is
sued an order whereby mail is sent, to
Clarksville on Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Saturdays only, instead of daily as
heretofore. Mail to Clnrksville is
put off the afternoon passenger train
at White Rock and taken by carrier to
Clarksville, three miles distant. It
appears that nobody wants to carry
the mail daily for 8300, the maximum
amount offered by the department,
hence the new ruling. At one time
there was talk of having a rural de
livery route from Folsom through the .
Clarksville district, and it is probable
that the people of that section may
look upon the proposition favorably
when they find themselves deprived of

a monster bear. Mr Bruin tried to
make his escape, the boys not knowing
what fear is, and both being mounted
on good horses gave chase and after
going through standing timber and
felled logs for several hundred yards
his bearship concluded to stand his
ground. Mevlin had a carbine rifle at

Year's Report
The adjourned quarterly conference
was held at the Methodist church last
Tuesday evening. There was a large
attendance of officers ana members
present and a. good spirit prevailed all
through the session.
The pastor and officials gave their
reports for the year. The pastor,
Rev. T. H. Nicolas, reported that the
church had lost three members by re
moval, and two by death, and of re
ceiving one by letter, which leaves a
membership of 50 at the present time.
The pastor reported having made 630
pastorial calls during the year, and
preached 100 sermons, baptized five
children, married 14 couples, and
officiated at 21 funerals.
The president of the ladies aid
SDciety reported that 13 meetings had
been held, that $64.75 had been re
ceived for dues, and that $340.75 had
been received from other sources, a.
total for the year of more than
$405.00. She reported that this money
had been applied as follows : Ex
penses in parsonage, $21.65; debts
paid, $147.35; applied for pastor's
salary, $236.50.
The Sunday school superintendent
reported an attendance as good, with
111 children and 15 officers and
teachers, and an average attendance
of 85.
The church treasurer reports that
$89855. had been received to date, and
this amount $815.40 had been applied
on pastor's salary, and the balance for
janitor, fuel, taxes etc., leaving a
deficiency of $184. which the officials
will endeavor to raise by the end of
September.
The pastor spoke in tho highest
terms of his treatment in Jackson dur
ing the past three years, that he had
been kindly received by all classes of
people, and thanked them for standing
so loyally by him. He hopes that the
same kind of treatment would be
given to his successor, and that the
faithful few, who so loyally stood by
the church, would soon be cheered by
seeing a great revival of interest and
spirituality, and that tho next year
would be the best year in the history
of the charge. .■''■*' * '■ ■'■

A Foolish Scare
1 The Amador Record reports an in
cipient run on the branch of the Ama
dor county bank at Sutter Creek. The
facts as far as we have been able to
find out, are about as follows : Par
ties in the vicinity of Drytown
thoughtlessly began joshing one
known to have money on deposit in the
bank, saying that it was advisable to
get the money as soon as possible,
conveying the idea that the bank was
shaky. This talk worked upon the de
positor, who took steps to withdraw
the amount. There was a bit of a
scare on the part of a few timid ones,
but the matter was speedily quieted,
when it became known that there was
not the slightest basis for uneasiness ;
that the bank was as sound as any in
the country, with cash always on hand
to meet any emergency. ■ The rumor
was floated to Jackson, and inquiries
were made at the parent bank, but
nothing in the shape of a demand for
deposits above the ordinary occurred.
Indeed, the deposits amounted to more
than the withdrawals. The incident is
mentioned to show the danger of even
joking remarks about banking institu
tions. Of course, no banking institu
tions in the country could meet the de
mands, if a majority of depositors
•were to call for their money at the
same time. Banking business is based
on the principle of using a large per
centage of depositors' money by loan
ing the same out. There would be no
profit in the business if this were
not done. When one-third of the
amount of deposits is held in cash in
the bank, it is deemed ample for all
purposes. With securities also on
hand that can be at once con
verted into cash in case of emergency,
a bank is as safe as it is possible to
make it, and transact an ordinary
banking business. This is the policy
of the local bank, and it is safe to say
that few banks in the state can com
pare with it in conservative and care
ful management.

negligence, resulting in the death of
James H Sargent, by the caving of the
roof of the drift, while working in
said mine on the 14th of September,
1909. The complaint sets forth that
the deceased was a single - man, aged
32 years, and a son of the plaintiff,
and a resident of Amador county at
the time of his death ; that the plain
tiff was dependent upon his earnings
for support. On the 24th of Septem
ber of last year, the defendant
neglected to place sufficient timbers in
a certain drift or tunnel, in which
said Sargent was working, to support
the roof that Sargent had no notice or
means of knowing that the drift was
dangerous, that while working there
on the above date the roof caved,
crushing Sargent to such an extent
that he died ; that at that time and
prior thereto, he had been contributing
$59 per month out of his earnings for
the support of plaintiff. Frank W
Sargent is attorney for plaintiff.

Doc Golding Gets
Bad Set Back
An epidemic of influenza among
horses is reported throughout this sec
tion of the county, and many animals
as n result are in a serious condition.
The disease causes the legs to swell,
and eyes become very much inflamed.
Several cases thus far are reported as
having fully recovered, and no deaths
have rs yet occurred.
Dr.dqldlng, the popular veterinarian
from Jackson, is telling his friends of
an incident from which he is just re
covering.
Lnst week he drove over to Drytown
and there met one of the leading
stock raisers in the country. (folding
entered into a conversation with the
stockman, after informing him that
he was a veterinary, and explained to
him the theory of bacteria, trying to
impress upon his listener, all the im
portant points that he thought would
be of value. After an exhaustive
lecture, the stockman turned to Gold
ing and said. ''What is that you told
me you were representing?" Why I
am a veterinary surgeon replied Gold
ing. "Oh," Eaid the stockman, "and
what is that?" After recovering from
his collapse, Golding whispered, "I'm
only a horse doctor."
/V Big Time in Stockton.
During the big Produce Fair and
Carnival which will take place in

be four big days of fun, frolic and
pleasure, as well as profitable instruc
tion. The produce exhibits will be
many and varied, and will give every
visitor a more vivid idea of what San
Joaquin and surrounding counties are
able to produce All exhibits will be
welcome and very liberal cash pre
miums and prizes will be awarded to
the best exhibits. Several rates will
be given by all the railroads and
every provision will be made for the
comfort and pleasure of visitors.
Everybody and his family are invited
to attend. Come early and stay late.
If you don't have a good time tell us
about it. Music, fun, frolic, and a
good, big, lively round of pleasure for
all. Remember the dates.
Pigeon Captured
Last Sunday one of the Cuneo boys,
living near Clinton, noticed a strange
bird flying in the air. Its appearance
and motions attracted his attention.
It was no ordinary bird of the do
mestic pigeon variety. It is reported
that on seeing it Cuneo shouted
"Hello, Bill." . Whether the bird
understood the call, or from exhaus
tion, we cannot say, but it flew to the
caller, and was easily captured. It
proved to be a pigeon of homing or
carrier variety. It bore a silver band
on one leg, inscribed "J. L. 1304."
It was evidently tired after a long
flight, and descended for rest and foo-'.
With its needs supplied, it would no
doubt resumed its journey, or returned
home. It was brought to Jackson the
same da,,, and sold to a boy for^ 50c.
What became of it we have been un
able to learn.
Smoke Signals
The traveler on the plains in the
early duys soon learned the signifi
cance of the spires of smoke that he
sometimes saw rising from a distant
ri3ge or hill, and answered from a
different direction. It was the signal
talk of the Indians across miles of in
tervening ground, a signal used in
rallying the warriors for an attack, or
warning them for a retreat.
The Indian had a way of Bending the
smoke up in rings or puffs, knowing
that such a smoke column would at
once be noticed and understood as a
signal and not mistaken for the smoke
of some camp fire. He made his rings
by covering the little fire with his
blanket for a moment and allowing the
smoke to ascend, says Harper's Week
ly. The column of ascending . smoke
rings said to every Indian within
thirty miles: "Beware! An enemy is
near!" Three smokes built close to
gether meant "Danger." One smoke
merely meant "Attention." Two
Bmokes meant "Camp at this place."
Frequently at night the settler or
the traveler saw fiery lines crossing
the sky shooting up and falling, per
haps taking a direction diagonal to the
lines of vision. He might guess that
these were the signals of the Indians,
but unless he were an old-timer he
might not be able to interpret the sig
nals. The old-timer and the squaw
man know that one fire arrow, an
arrow prepared by treating the head
of the shaft with gunpowder and fine
bark, means the same as three
columns of smoke puffs--" An enemy,
is near. " Two arrows meant "Dan
ger," three arrows, "The danger is
great. ' ' Several arrows indicated
"The enemy is too powerful for us."

Peach Culture
We last week gave a notice of some
peaches brought to our office the pro
duct of the garden of C. M. Meek, in
Jackson. These samples were not
only of large size but as fine in flavor
as any we have ever tasted. A pecu
liar feature of this matter remains
to be told. The tree from which this
fruit was plucked was planted many
years ago, and while it grew strong
and healthy, the fruit never amounted
to anything. It was looked upon as a
useless tree as far as fruit bearing
qualities are concerned. The big fire
which destroyed the Meek residence,
together with other buildings, scorched
this particular tree to such an extent
as to kill one half of it. The other
half, however, seemed to thrive on
this baptism of fire, and last year the
tree yielded 200 pounds of peaches—
not the insipid and unpalatable fruit
of former years, but fine, luscious,
rich-flavored fruit that would com
mand a good price in any market.
Thi» year the tree is also well loaded
with the same kind of fruit. Now the
question arises, what was there in
this scorching of three summers ago to
change this then worthless tree into a
fruit-bearing tree that would be
creditable to any orchards? Was it
actually purified by fire? Did the
scorching kill the poor qualities of the
tree, and leave the good qualities not
only unimpaired, but of increased
vitality? Or was it the fertilizing
ashes of the fire that put the elements
in the soil that made the wonderful
difference. This is a problem worth
solving by those conducting scientific
researches.
The facts are just as we have stated,
and the cause is worthy of careful
investigation. If useless trees can be
converted into valuable fruit-bearing
trees by the application of the scorch
ing process, orchardists will be glad
to know it. If any of our readers
have met with similar experience along
the lines herein stated, we should be
pleased if they will inform us of the
facts, for the benefit of others.

Senator John B. Curtin of Tuolumne
county, who has been recognized as a
progressive in the larger sense of the
word ever since his entry to state
politics, has gained a peculiar ad
vantage in the legislature through his
close study of constitutional queu
tions. It was his acquaintance with
the more intricate problem of legisla
tion that enabled a quick decision in
1906, when it was necessary to make
immediate provisions for the stricken
city's rehabilitation. His careful
scrutiny and able argument concern
ing every measure presented in the
upper house has gained for him the
sobriquet of "Constitutional John,"
and he is the constant advisor of all
his colleagues.
■ The state legislature in extraor
dinary session called by Ihe governor
has submitted to the people two
amendments to the constitution of the
state, which have for their purpose
the addition of $10,000,000 to the funds
for the international exposition which

Railroad Rates on all Railroads
California expects to hold in San
Francisco in 1915 to celebrate the
completion and opening of the Panama
Canal. .
One measure provides for a state
tax-levy through which a sum of $1,
250.000 annually for a term ot four
years is to be turned over to the ex
position fund ; another enables the city
of San Francisco to amend her char
ters so as to call for a municipal
bond-issue of $5,000,000. and as the
former measure concerns the entire
state at large, it was given the most
careful attention possible by my fel
low-members of the state senate and
myself in a general desire to safe
guard the tax-payers ot the interior
against possible waste or misuse of
the fund created by their combined
assistance.
I think this has been done satis
factorily in the measure which the
voters of the state will be asked to
approve at the general election in
November. To begin with, during
the entire term of operation of this
constitutional amendment the tax will
be levied upon every kind and
character of property in the state of
California, including railroad or any
other corporate or private property,
which wna subject to taxation on July
lfi^, 1010. Secondly, there is creatcti in
the state treasury a special fund, to lie
known as the Panama-i'acific Inter
national ESxDoiUion fund, into which
all moneys collected from this tax-levy
are to be paid; nn;l it is providsd
that the state legislature shall pres
cribe the timp, manner, terms and
conditions upon which the fund shall
he drnwn out of the state treasury by
the state; comrniaaion to be created
hereafter for the purpose of disburs
ing this fund, where contracts ami
vouchcts Shall be filed, to whom and
how of ttn ieport3 shall be made nnd
what disposition /shall bo made of any
surplus.
Ine taxpayers of the state are fur
ther safeguarded by a provision
authorizing the state commission to
make such propsr contracts with the
exposition company as will entitle the
state of California to share equally
with subscribers to the stock of the
company in any returns from the ex
position. In this way, the state vir
tually becomes a "stockholder in the
enterprise without a stockholder's
liability.
I am of the opinion that the people
of California should not be afraid to
vote this tax-levy at the polls in No
vember. Under Constitutinal Amend
ment No. 1., drawn by myself nnd of
which I stood sponsor at the last re
gular session of the state legislature,
there will be d separation of state and
county taxes hereafter, and all public
service corporations will be taxed up
o.i their gross receipts; always pro
vided the voters of the state approve
this proposed constitutional amend
ment at the polls in November. By
the application of a percentage of the
gross receipts as the basis of taxation,
the state of California will get the
benefit, of its percentage of any great
increase of business derived by rail
roads and other public service corpora
tions, so that for every $100 earned by
a railroad during the progress of the
exposition, the state .will receive $4.00,
a greater percentage than could be
obtained through the old system of
physical valuation. Had this amend
ment been in force in 1909 there would
have resulted more revenue ; for the
entire tax-levy bill as passed at the
last session provided no raise.
I call the attention of the people,
therefore, to the legal fact that this
tax for the proposed exposition will be
the only ad valorem tax they will be
called upon to pay during the operation
of the proposed constitutional amend
ment.
As the amount of the tax I am of
the opinion that the Panama Pacific
International Exposition proposed to
be held in San Francisco in 1915 will
develop into at least a $50,000,000 en
terprise ; so that all the people of the
state are asked to contribute will
amount to not more than 10 per cent
of the aggregate value of the exposi
tion.

I DRIFTED SNOW FLOUR IElection Proposition
Many are inquiring the reason for
the supervisors calling the special
election on the question of establish
ing a county high on the day prior to
the general election. It is contended
that the two elections on succeeding
days— 7th nnd Bth November— will be
apt to Interfere one with the other.
The only plea that has been advanced
for this fiction by the supervisors is
that it will save the expense of one
distribution of electric booths and
supplies. One trip over the county
will answer for both elections. This
seems to be running the economy itfea
into the ground. The few dollars saved
by thia arrangement does not begin to
offset the inconvenience of the voters
occassioned thereby. Certainly voters
distant from a polling place are not
likely to make the two trios necessary
to cast a ballot at both elections.
Arrested in
Calaveras County.
Bert Hancock was arrested at Camp
Seco last Monday, on a warrant issued
by W. L. Rose, justice of the peace
at Sutter Creek, on complaint of his
wife, charging him with neglecting to
provide for his family. The warrant
was served by the authorities of Calu
veras county, and the accused was
lodged in jail at San Andreas. Sheriff
Gregory went over there Tuesday, and
brought the defendant to Jackson, and
placed him . in the county jail. On
Wednesday he was taken to Sutter
Creek to answer to the charge.
Some time ago Hancock was married
to Mrs Frout, who was a resident of
this town for several years. She was
• then a widow, with several children,'
two of who were minors, between ten
and fifteen years of age. After a
time the family returned to this
county, living at Sutter Creek, Han
cock securing work at the South
■ Eureka mine. According to his ac
count, after receiving his pay he went
around and paid his bills, as far as the
money would go. This was his habit,
as he wished to deal honestly with all.
A difference arose between him and
his wife on financial matters, and he
left some three weeks ago. Pie ob
tained work at the copper mine at
Camp Seco, and had been worKing
there about a week when arrested on
this charge. It is said he had not re
tteived any pay up to that time. The
affair has given birth to a good deal of
unfavorable , comment. Hancock has
no children of his own.
Deafness Can not ue Cured
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear)
Thero is only ono way to cure deafness
and that is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous "lining: of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
flamed you have :i rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing 1 , and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can; oe
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever! nino cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is 'noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.

Primary Election Cost
The cost of the late primary election
in Amador county was approximately
$3500. While this is a heavy toll for
simply furnishing candidates for the
various offices to be filled by election,
it is moderate •in comparison with
some counties. In Sacramento the
expense run up to $20,000. When the
cost per capita is considered, however,
Amador stands pretty well up to the
top of the list. There were less than
1500 votes cast in this county, so that
the cost per vote was about $2.50.
The aggregate cost was considerably
more than at a general election— state
or presidential. The next legislature
will no doubt amend the law so as to
make more economical as well as more
efficient. Taxpayers will not be satis
fied to pay so heavily for simply nam
ing candidates for office.
Don't Break Down.
Severe strains on the vital organs,
like strains on machinery, cause
break-downs. You can't over-tax
stomach, liver, kidnej'3, bowels or
nerves without serious danger to your
self; If you are weak or run down, or
under strain. of any kind, take Electric
Bittevs the matchle33, tonic medicine.
Mrs J. E. Van de Sande.of Kirkland,
111., writes: "That I did not break
down, while enduring a most severe
strain, for three months, is due wholly
to Electric Bitters. " Use them and
enjoy health and strength. Satisfac
tion positively guaranteed. 50 cents
