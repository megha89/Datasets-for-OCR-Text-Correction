Bad Stomach Makes
Bad Blood.
You can not make sweet butter in a
foul, unclean churn. The stomach serves
as a churn In which to agitate, work up
and disintegrate our food as it is being
digested. If it be weak, sluggish anS
foul the result will be torpid, sluggish
livetfand bad. impure blood.
•Tie ingredients of Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery are just such as best
serve to correct and cure al. such de-
rangements. It is made up without a
drop of alcohol in its composition; chem
Ically pure, triple-refined glycerine being
used instead of the commonly employed
alcohol. Jsow this glycerine is of itseff a
valuable medicine, instead of a deleteri-
ous agent like alcohol, especially in the
cure of weak stomach, dyspepsia and the
various forms of indigestion. Prof. Finley
Ellingwood, M. D,, of Bennett Medical
College, Chicago, says of it:
"In dyspepsia it serves an excellent pur-
pose. • ♦ • It is one of the best manufact-
ured products of the present time In Its
action upon enfeebled, disordered stomachs-
especially if tbere is ulceration or catarrhal
eastrltts (catarrhal inflammation of stomach),
it is a most efficient preparation. Glycerine
will relieve many cases of pyrosis (heartburn)
and excessive gastric acidity.' It is useful in
chronic intestinal dyspepsia, especially the
flatulent variety, and in certain forms of
chronic constipation, stimulating the secre-
tory and excretory functions of the intestinal
glands."
When combined, in just the right propor-
tions, wit* Golden Seal root, Stone root
Black Cherrybark, Queen's root, Blood-
root and Mandrake root, or the extracts of
these, as in Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery, there can be no doubt of its
great efficacy in the euro of Ul stomach,
liver and intestinal disorders and derange-
ments. These several ingredients have
the strongest endorsement in all such
cases of such eminent medical leaders as
Prof. R. Bartholow. M. D.. of Jefferson Med-
ical College. Chicago: Prof. Hobart A. Hare.

The new Hsh-oar of Dr. Eugene
Erlwein, a German, carries no heavy
tank of water but keeps the tiah alive
during long journeys in a supply of
liquid just sufficient to keep the gills
moist. Small pumps keep the water
in circulation, passing it through an
apparatus that charges it with oxygen
and extracts the carbonic- acid. In
the laboratory, the lisb are placed on
shelves in a large glass case, and here,
entirely out of water pike, trout, nnd
other finned creatures live con
tentedly for an indefinite time, hav
ing been shown to be as much alive
as ever at the end of thirty hours.
The oxygen supplied is kept moist by
passing through water and by a wet
oloth on the floor of the case.
Red is believed by Dr. Beddoe, a
European anthropologist, to have
been the original oolor of the hair of
Europeans, and he attributes the
brown pigment to the aotion of heat.
Ked hair is occasionally found among
the negroes, and dull dark hair
among the pigmies of Central Africa,
Chinese and Japanese adults always
have black hair, but Japanese child
ren sometimes have dark reddish
yellow hair, and Chinese children
may have brown hair.
As protective coating for iron,
cadmium is proving much superior to
zinc. The coating looks like zino, but
it is much more adhesive, and harder,
it tarnishes less rapidly, and with
stands the fumes of acids better.
] A diamond burning in the electric
arc was lately exhibited on a screen
by Sir William Crookes. The stone
could be seen to sprout and swell and
blacken under the intense heat until
nothing remained but a swollen lump
of graphite.
Reasons for expecting astonishing
results from the treatment ot certaiu
eye diseases at elevated stations have
been found by Dr. Robert Dolnoy,
of Paris. From a balloon at a height
ot 6,000 feet a falling bottle was
watched until it reached a lake, and
was then seen as it sank, and ex
amination at a greater altitude show
ed much distension of the pupils as
an effect ot the rarefied atmosphere
with increased sensitiveness of the
optic nerve. This remarkable sensi
tiveness should greatly aid the usual
remedies. Two common eye troubles
are glaucoma and ohoroiditis, or the
releasing and loosening of the retina,
and theae are among the diseases that
should receive espeoial benefit.
Corticite, the new Portuguese heat
insulating material, has granulated
oork for its principal component'
and it is claimed to be a perfect
insulator, resisting the greatest
extremes of climate and the attacks
ot inseots. even ot white ants. It can
be sawed and bored like wood. It is
not inflammable, and is of value for
many purposes. A covering of it for
steam-pipes and boilers is claimed to
effeot great saving of heat, corres
pondingly reducing the temperature
of the boiler room.
Tiie oldest stone axe known is
claimed by M. B. C'otesworth, a
Yorkshire man. The semi-circular
blade is about eight inches across, an
mob and a halt thick, and gruund
down to a fine edge, with a stiff stout
haft, possibly cut to fit into a wooden
cleft handle. Striated scratches prove
its pro-glacial origin, and establish
the existence of man in the North of
England in pre-glaoial times.
Carefully suspended thermometers
have shown a German chemist very
material differences in the tempera
ture of an ordinary air oven, whether
heated by gas or electrioity, with
metallic or porcelain walls, with air
ventilator open or chut. The tem
perature in two of the corners is
usually much higher— otten as much
as 17 degrees C— than it is in the
other two coiners or center.
Keuords show great risk to workers
in caissons at pressures of four
atmospheres and by divers at depths
of 100 to 150 feet, and the British
Admiralty has fixed the limit for
divers at 120 feet. The most daring
pearl and sponge Ushers reach 115
feet, accidentjbeing frequent. Lam
bert, who brought $500,000 from a
depth of 160 feet, remained below 20
minutes eaoh trip, taking an equal
time in ascending, but at last he was
permanently injured by too long a
stay below. The deepest recorded dive
is 201 feet, but the diver died fiom
too rapid asceut. Two recent British
investigators of the effects of high
pressure have shut eaoh other into a
steel cylinder of a capacity of 12 feet,
with a pump raising, the pressure to
seven atmospheres in 10 minutes. In
this pressure they suffered no barm
when decompression was gradual and
circulation was aided by movements
of the body. The conclusion is con
firmed that fatal results to divers are
due to the rapid decompression.
The autopsies of two years at tbe
London zoological gardens have
shown a medical student a relation
between the size of tbe heart and
tendency to consumption. Tbe
smaller tbe ratio of tbe heart to tbe
body in weight tbe greater is tbe
liability to disease Tbe deer, whose
heart weight is 1-90 of that of tbe
body, is practically immune, while
its antelope cousin, with a heart
weight of 1-200, is a very frequent
victim. Tbe cow, with a heart weight
of 1.-150, is the most susceptible of
all animals. Tbe horse, ass and
zebra, with heart weights of 1-90 to
1-100, are almost immune. Applying
the rule to human subjects, it proves
to hold good, tbe consumptives being
those with poorly developed hearts.
Silver on glass mirrors have been
long familiar. In a uew process, an
English electrician deposits copper
from the black oxide by electrolytic
means, and produces very brilliant
mirrors of a thin tllm of copper on
glass.
Prof. Tyler, of Amherst college,
said recently: "A man can live
comfortably without brains: no man
ever existed without a digestive
system. The dyspeptic bas neither
taitb. hope or charity." Day by day
people realize tbe importance of
caring for their digestion; realize tue
need of the use of a little corrective
after overeating. A corrective like
Kodol for dyspepsia, it digests what
yoa eat. Sold by F. W. Rusher.
Interesting Notes About the Moon.
Our moon bas the distinction of
being tbe largest of all planetary
satellites; so large, indeed, says tbe
Strand Magazine, that to the inhabit
ants of Mars it must appear with tbe
earth as a wonderfully beautiful twin
planet.
Beoause the moon rotates on its
axis in exactly tbe same time that it
revolts around the earth we are
destined to see little more than one
hemisphere. So slow is this rotation
that tbe lunar day is equal to fifteen
of our days. For half a month the
moon is exposed to the fierce heat of
the sun; for half a month it spins
through space in tbe densest gloom.
Although separated from us by a
distance that at times reaches 253,000
miles, and is never less than 222,000
miles, we know more of the physical
formation of the single pallid face
that the moon ever turns toward us
than we know of certain parts of Asia
and the heart of Africa. Powerful
telescopes have brought our satellite
within a distance of forty miles of
the eartb. Physicists have mathemat
ically weighed it and fixed its mass
at one-eightieth of the earth, or 73,
000,000,000,000 tons.
Kent by Fires Long Dead.
The muon presents aspects without
any terrestial parallel. Rent by tires
long since dead, its honeycombed
crust seems like a great globe of
chilled slag. Craters are not un
common on the earth, but in number,
size, and structure they bear, for the
most part, little resemblance to those
of tbe moon.
A lunar crater is not tbe mouth of
a volcano having a diamety of a few
hundred feet, but a great circular
plain twenty-five, even 100 miles in
diameter, surrounded by a precipice
rising to a hmgbt of 500 or 10,000
feet, with a central bill or two about
half as high.
Water can not possibly exist as a
liquid; tor tbe temperature ot tbe
moon's surface during tbe long lunar
night is probably not far from 160
degrees below tbe zero mark of a
Fahrenheit thermometer, and the
atmospheric pressure is so low that a
gas under pressure would solidity as
it esoaped. 100 and snow are the
forms, then, which lunar water must
assume.
Because of tbe present paucity of
water tbe moon's atmosphere is so
exceedingly rare that startling effects
are produced. Perhaps tbe most
striking is that of the sunrise. Dawn
and the soft golden glow that usher
in terrestrial day there can not be.
Tbe sun leaps from tbe horizon a
flaming sickle, and the loftier peaks
immediately flash into light.
There is no azure sky to relieve the
monotonous effects of inky black
shadows and dazzling white expanses.
Tbe sun gleams in fierce splendor,
with no clouds to diffuse its blinding
light. All day long it is accompanied
by tbe weird zodiacal light that we
behold at rare intervals.
Heavens Black at Midday.
Even in midday the heavens are
pitch black, so that, despite the sun
light, the stars and planets gleam
with a brightness that they never
exhibit to us even on tbe dearest of
moonless nights at sea. They shine
steadily, too; for it is tbe earth's
atmosphere that causes tbem to
twinkle to our eyes.
In tbe line of sight it is impossible
to estimate distances, for there is no
such phenomenon as aerial perspect
ive. Objects are seen only when the
rays of the sun strike tbem.
At times there may be observed
spots which darken after sunrise and
gradually disappear toward sunset.
They can not be caused by shadows;
for shadows would be least visible
when tbe sun is directly overhead.
Tbey appear most quickly a* tbe
equator, and invade tbe bigber
altitudes after a lapse of a tew days.
In tbe polar regions they have never
been seen. What are tbey? Organic
life resembling vegetation, answers
Prof. Pickering of Harvard univer
sity; vegetation that flourishes
luxuriantly while the sun shines
and withers at night.
A single day, it may be urged, is
not sttlciently long for tbe develop
ment and decay ot vegetation; but
sixteen hours on tbe moon is little
more than half an hour on tbe earth;
a day lasts halt a month, and may be
regarded as a miniature season. —

Advantages of Alcohol.
The decision of the government to
permit the manufacture and sale of
ethyl alcohol free of any tax where i
is denaturalized, or rendered unfit for
use as a beverage by treating it witn
some suitable denaturant, is of tbe
highest importance to this country.
Tbis is a fact which is receiving due
attention from tbe soientido and in
dustrial press of the* country.
Tests which have been made at dis
tilling plants in Illinois show that
from one bushel of corn no less than
five gallons of proof alcohol can be
distilled. Estimating the cost of a
bushel of corn at 42 cents, the entire
expense of a gallon of this alcohol is
but 10.78 cents. The Cuban distill
eries extract a gallon of alcohol
(whioh is 90 per cent absolute) from
two gallons ot the molasses— molasses
ot a quality whioh is brought to tbis
country and sold at three cents a
gallon. The average expense of
manufature, based on this price for
the raw material, is less than ten
cents.
The importance of nloohol as a fac
tor in producing light, heat arid
power is of the greatest magnitude.
Indeed, it promises to become one of
the main elements for illumination
in the United States, not excluding
petroleum, gas and the electric lamp,
for the light produoed by it is of the
very highest quality. To illustrate
its advantages over kerosene and
other forms of illuminating oils, v
French inventor has perfeoted a lamp
which burns alcohol in connection
with a Welsbach mantle. Tests
which have been made with this type
of lamp resulted in producing
illumination equal to 25 candlepower
for a period of 59 hours with a con
sumption of one gallon of alcohol.
Prof. Rousseau ot the University ot
Belgium holds tbat alcohol at 31
cents per gallon is more economical
as an illuminant than kerosene at 15
cents per gallon, owing to its superior
light producing properties. Accord
ing to Prof. Rousseau's conclusions,
a given quantity for lighting and
heating purposes is equal to at least
twice the quantity of highly refined
petroleum in the form of kerosene.
Earth's Coal Supply.
A German periodical, Stabl und
Eisen, has published some optimistic
figures about the supply of coal in
the earth. Germany's deposits of
coal are put down at 280,000,000,000
tons, wbicb, with the present con
sumption, will suffice for a couple of
thousand years. The other European
powers, in the opinion of this author
ity, are in a much less favorable
position. Thus tbe coal deposits of
Great Britain and Ireland amount to
only about halt of those of Germany,
or about 19,000,000,000 tons, and as
tbe annual consumption is twice as
big as that of Germany, England may
have exhausted her supplies in some
350 years. The aggregate for Europe
is about 700,000,000,000 tons of coal.
The coal deposits ot North America
are estimated to contain nearly as
mucb as those ot Europe, or 681,000,
000,000 tons; but even tbis gigantic
figure is completely dwarfed by Asia's
wealth of coal, as to which it is at
present impossible to make an ap
proximate estimate. China more
epecially seems to possess inexhaust
ible supplies, and a German scientist
bas put tbe coal deposits of tbe pro
vince ot Shan Shi alone at 1,200,000,
000,000 tons.
Sailors' Superstitions.
All sailors are superstitious, and
the legends of tbe sea are legion,
ranging from phantom ships to
spectral lights suddenly gleaming
from yardarms and mastheads. That
many of these legends are very
ancient may be proved by the tact
that sea harpies are described by
Homer and Hesiod, while according
to Virgil they plundered Aenaes dur
ing bis voyage to Italy. The beautiful
sirens, too, are of classic origin.
Weird, indeed, says the English
Illustrated Magazine, are tbe tales of
naunting spectres, lit to send one's
nerves a-shivering after a hearty
supper, well suited for Christmas
time ghost stories. There are the
four Goblins of Dunter's Ness, not
ghouls, but evil water spirits, who
appear twice a year, only in midwin
ter, but biiug bad luok in a very
short time to the snip from nhich
tbey are sighted.
We must mention Adamaster, the
dreaded ghost of tbe Cape, that used
to be seen in a halo of cloud and mist
over Good Hope, and also the silent
man of Wexford harbor, tbe wander
ing soul of the Dutch skipper wbo
lost bis smack on his way to Duhlin
some three centuries ago. Gbbstiy
apparitiens are not, however, the
only ones to be feared at sea. In tbe
case of St. Elmo's tire these appari
tions take the shape of spectral lights
suddenly gleaming from yardarms or
mastheads. It was known by ancient
navigators as Castor and Pollux— the
best omen it seen double, but a
signal danger if seen single.
Jack bas a score of well-known
superstitions, may of wbicb are of
very long descent, sunh as the pre
sence of figureheads, the blessing of
ships and the "crossing ot the line."
And it will be remembered ibat tbo
prince and princess of Wales both
paid tribute to old Noptune while en
their journey to Australia.
Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. For
weak indigestion, for defective nour

YOU SABE ME.
Based on a true episode of the San
Francisco tire.
Believe in Cbinsee exclusion
Well, maybe I did before
The day of the great confusion,
When the quake in its wrath uptore
The roots of the town, and the reaper
Mowed us with flame— then saw
The faith ot a race that's deeper
Than any exclusion law,
Yes, 1 took in the politicians'
Rhetoric, buncomb, air,
Who from their fat positions,
Mentioned the "white man's share, "
The white man's right to bully
Tbe race with the braided queue-
Kick 'em from boat to alley,
Cheat 'em in bench and pew.
bong was the name of our coolie—
Long-lingered Canton boy-
Went at his job with a truly
Pagan sort of a joy.
Serving man, cook and waiter,
Roustabout, general slob—
That's what the Chinese hater
Calls "taking a white man's job "
We lived in the Kincon section
Alice, the kid and I.
Bong was the home protection,
And held his position high.
Gentle he was with the baby-
Never was cross or grim.
Used to explain, "Oh, maybe
1 catchem 111' gal like him!"
When I left for the city early,
In the era before the wreck,
After I kissed my girlie
And the kid clung close to my neck.
Then I'd chuckle to Bong, "You
chinkei,
Take oare of 'em both, d'ye see?"
So the coolie would grin like a tinker
And answer, "You sabe me!"
Bong, though his head was level,
His conscience ironed to a gloss,
Rather worshipped the devil
And sneered at the Christian josa.
He learned from the heathen sages
A budget of useful lore,
And 1 found him investing his wages
In a Chinese general store.
Tnose years that 1 spent with Alice
On the hills of our merriment!
Every man's bouse was bis palace —
(We are living now in a tent).
By the sweet bay we slumbered,
From the gay height looked down
Who thought that our days were
numbered
And bell was beneath tbe town?
I was away in Seattle;
The earthquake rumbled through
Like the jar of a mighty battle-
Then the news ot the horror grew.
"San Francisco is shaken —
Half tbe buildings down-
Dead from the ruins taken—
Fire is sweeping the town!"
How 1 tore to the station,
Drank with a man's despair;
Chaos was on creation
My wife and my child out there!
We squeezed in the trains like cattle
Packed in tbe slaughter stall;
And when we pulled out of Seattle
The night was beginning to fall.
Traveling men and sailors,
Millionaires, merchants, sports,
Two-penny clerks and tailors.
Touts from the coast resorts,
Spoke ot their homes like brothers
Bonded in grief and— when
I prayed, "God pity the mothers!"
A gambler whispered, "Amen. "
Oakland, a ball of terror,
Blindud the sun on high;
Tho bay, like a broken mirror,
Glared to the smoking sky.
Tattered and smoke bedeviled
Crowds upon crowds poured through,
Limping, insane, disheveled—
And the glare from the city grew.
Day was short. And tbe darkness
Out of tbe smoke clouds fell.
Tbe ferry spire stood black in tbe fire
Like a craig at tbe mouth of bell.
All night long swung tbe ferries,
Listed and cramped and crpmmed,
And all night long came the fleeing
throng.
Like the hosts of tbe haunted dammed.
Twenly-four hours at the ferries
I searched tbe mad thousands
through.
Haggard and wan 1 looked upon,
But never a face 1 knew.
Beggars, burdened with riches,
Muttered and toiled ahead —
1 called aloud in tbe face of tbe crowd,
Wbo looked with the eyes of tbe
dead.
Then someone spoke from the clamor
With a voice that 1 seemed to know,
"They are safe back there on Ports
mouth square —
1 saw them an hour ago."
They wore warm under cover
Closo to the monument.
It wasu't so bad, for the Chinatown
lad
Had stretched up a sheet like a tent.
"He bad brought tbem food from

And seooie.l to be keeping house.

The kid was wrapped in his blouse.

When 1 oalled from the throng,

And be answered, "l'ou sabe mo!'

Splashed over his outsreatcbed hand
And of all tbe pure Christian blessings

Of mv heathen coolie boy.
One night more at the ferry,
I could see her, heaven be blessed !
Out of the mob she came with a sob
And fainted away on my bresat. '
Bong sat near with the baby
Fast asleep on bis knee,
And he said, as he smiled and looked
at the child,
"I fetchem— you sabe me!"

Virginia First Defied England,
Norfolk, Va.— The coming James
town Exposition brings to mind many
historic tacts long since forgotten.
While loath to leave tbe British
empire, the patriots ot Norfolk, Va.,
were the first to resent tbe aggression
of tbe British stamp act which led to
the American revolution. Under
the name ot the "Sons of Liberty"
tbey assembled in Norfolk on March
13th, and in bold and determined
pbrases announced their intention of
resisting any further aggression on
the part of the English Parliament.
This was two months before the pro
mulgation of the celebrated Mecklen
burg declaration of independence,
and nearly five before tbe thirteen
colonies assembled in Philadelphia to
forever cast off the authority of the
British crown and start the country
on a career of prosperity and splen
dor which will be celebrated at tbe
Jamestown Exposition to be held at
Hampton Roads near Norfolk in 1907.
The Norfolk people did not declare
their indedendence, but expressly
affirmed their wish to be subjects of
King George 111. They merely stated
their determination that tbey should
not be taxed without representation.
The resolutions read as follows:
»'Having taken into consideration
tbe evident tendency of that oppress
ive and unconstitutional act uf parlia
ment commonly called tbe stamp act,
and being desirous that our senti
ments should be known to posterity,
and recollecting that we are a part of
tbe colony wbo first in general assem
bly openly expressed their detestation
to tbe said act (which is pregnant
with ruin and productive of tee most
pernicious consequences) and, unwill
ing to rivet tbe shackles of slavery
and oppression on ourselves and mil
lions yet unborn, have unanimuusly
come to tbe following resolutions:
1. Resolved, that we acknowledge
our lord and sovereign, King George
the Third, to be our rightful and law
ful king, and that we will at all times
to the utmost ot our power and abil
ity, support and defend bis most sa
cred person, crown and dignity; and
shall always be ready, when constitu
tionally called upon, to assist bis
majesty, with our lives and fortunes;
and to defend bis just rights and pre
rogatives.
2. Resolved, that we will by all law
ful ways and means which divine pro
vidence has put into our bands, de
fend ourselves in tbe full enjoyment
of, and preserve inviolate to poster
ity, those inestimable privileges of
all freeborn British subjects, ot being
taxed only by representatives of their
own choosing; and of being tried by
uoue but a jury oc tbeir peers. And
that if we quietly submit to the execu
ti onof tbe said stamp act all our
claims to oivil liberty will be lost, and
we and our subjects in America are
deprived of the invaluable privileges
aforementioned.
3. Resolved, tbat a committee be ap
pointed wbo shall, in such manner a?
tbey tbink proper, go upon necessarj
business and mako public the above
resolutions, and tbat tbey correspond
as they shall see occasion with the
associated sons ot and friends to
liberty iv the other British colonies
of Amerioa. "
As a result of the adoption of tbe
resolutions Lord Dunmore, the Brit
ish colonial governor, made a demon
stration before Norfolk, and several
shots were fired into the city from
the frigate Liverpool. As a result of
tbis and other outrages tbe Norfolk
people were ready to throw off all
authority and join «ith tbe othei
colonies when the Philadelphia Dec
laration of Independence was promul
gated.

of the town's saloons Wednesday
evening shortly after 10 o'clock,
having been in continuous progress

with five at the table, but shortly
narrowed down to two, Herman
Higgins and Al Young. Young

Near tbe end ot the game there was
over 52,000 in gold and paper on tbe

We want a local correspondent iv

daily San Francisco paper, and other
reading matter, as well as supply the

stationery and stamps for corre

correspondent at every point, even if
we have to pay cash for such service.
Now who will volunteer for this
work.
Something Out of Tune.
There appears to be something sadly
out of whack with our industrial
fabric The county is enjoying a
boom in prosperity never before wit
nessed to a like extent in its wonder
fully progressive history— indeed,
never paralleled in the world's his
tory. Every wage earner able and
willing to work is working at good
wages. The tramp of the army of the
unemployed is no more heard in the
land. . Every wheel in the complex
machinery of industry is moving to
its utmost capacity,' and still the out
put fails to satisfy the demands.
This has been the condition of
things toe years. It is not a mere
spasm. In sympathy with this labor
demand, the wages for all kinds of
manual work— the commonest grade
of labor has been traveling skyward,
and is still traveling. The spectacle
is presented of mechanics, — brick
layers for instance— receiving 810 per
day of eight hours, with $2 per hoar
overtime. Other tradesmen are
approximating these flood tide rates.
How long can the industrial iabric
hold up at such extortionate wages.
The whole system is turning topsy
tarvey. Brain work — such as that
demanded of lawyers, doctors, and
others— is not paid anything like in
proportion. Their average earnings
in these piping times do not total up
anyway near those of the oommon
laborers. The plain logic of this
situation is that we are long on the
devotees of the professions, and short
on artisans and unskilled toilers.
Our high-toned eduoational institu
tions are annually turning oat thou
sands of graduates to eke out a precar
rious living as lawyers, etc. The vast
majority of them will never be able
to earn more than a miserable exist
ence in their respective professions.
Many of them will be forced from
sheer necessity into the ranks of the
manual laborers, and will greatly
benefit their financial prospects by
the novel change of base. Think of
it. The monetary inducements are
now strongly drifting toward the
callings that require least "time and
mental capacity to master.
It is a very serious problem
whether the liberality of our educa
tional system has not largely contri
bution to thus throwing our indus
trial fabric into disorder. The popu
lar clamor for free higher educa
tion—that a university training
should be placed within easy reach of
every boy and girl— has div«rted
thousands from the paths of gainful
pursuits, tor which nature bad in
tended them, to the ragged edge of
professional life, where the struggle
for bare existence is becoming fiercer.
To some, who cling to the naked idea
that "labor is king" this condition
of affairs may seem right and proper,
and in accordance with their ideals.
Labor is the creator of ail wealth,
they cry; why should not labor own
that which it creates. But this cry
is a hollow and delusive one. Labor
is truly king. No one will dispute
that proposition. But labor itself,
even far beyond the sphere of the
terms skilled and unskilled in their
ordinary acceptation, —is graded and
classified by nature's inexoiable
decrees.
There is^as much difference in
mental and muscular labor in human
nature, as there is variety in the
metallic ores hid away iv the earth.
And the intrinsic value of the differ
ent kinds of human labor is governed
by the same immutable law that fixes
the value of the various metals. Gold
is placed at the top in value, not
because it is the most useful, but
because of its rarity and the difficul
ties involved in its recovery from its
native receptacles. Iron is a far
more useful metal, but it oannot
compete with the yellow metal in
value. So it is in the world of human
labor. The common muscular labor
is like the iron— there is plenty of
it. The high clasa expert mental
labor— the planning, inventive, and
scientific genius— represents the gold
iv the labor world. It is useless to
attempt to make the common iron
crowd the golden channel of labor.
But that is what our impractical
eduoational system is trying to ac
complish.

Let Us Be Circumspect.
The republican party should be
extremely caretul in the make up of
their county ticket this year. No
inherently weak or objectionable
candidate should be permitted to find
a place thereon, not merely because
of reducing the chances of capturing
the particular office concerned, bat
also because of reaction upon the
ticket as a whole. With a reasonably
satisfactory ticket, the republicans
ought to make a fairly clean sweep
this campaign. The anomalous situa
tion of a republican county being
filled with democratic office holders
should be reversed at the polls, and
will be, it the republicans do not
foolishly play into the hands of the
enemy in the make-up of the ticket.
It must be remembered that the
ballots this year will provide a circle
for voting v straight ticket. A cross
stamped within that circle will count
a vote for every candidate on the
republican or democratic ticket, as
the case may be without any other
mark. This immensely simplies the
task of voting. Many a voter will
siraplr stamp bis cross in the straight
ticket circle, and thereby avoid the
danger of losing his vote by illegal
marking, ibis disposition will be
sufficiently strong with many that the
make-up of the ticket, while slightly
objectionable to the individual, will
be swallowed np in the straight party
vote. As the republicans are in the
majority to the tune of 200 or more,
it must be seen that the republican
candidates should reap the lion's
share of the benefit from straight
tickets. No handicap should be
placed upon party success by any
link calculated to overcome this
inclination to vote the straight ticket.
There is disquietude in the ranks ot
the democracy. The little coterie ot
politicians— who imagine that they
hold Amador county, with its list of
fat berths, in their bands to be
shaped like plastic clay in the hands
of the potter— are worried at the
outlook. The people are getting on
to them, and they know it. They are
trying not only to fix up their own
broken down fences, but also to take
a hand in selecting material for the
opposition ticket according to their
desperate needs. This is an old
dodge. It has been worked effect
ually in the past, bat republicans
should be onto themselves sufficiently
to block it this year. To suggest a
weak candidate, to try to switch a
strong one from entering the raoe,
are taotics for which republicans
must be on the lookout. Put a good
ticket, on a strong platform of reform
in county affairs, and the veteis,
alive to their own interest, will do the
rest, and make an end of democratic
ring-rule government.
In Calaverasand Tuolumne counties
the republican county committee
have undertaken to appoint delegates
to the state convention from their
respective counties. Such arrogant
assumption of power is dangerous,
and inimical to party success in the
local campaign, in Calaveras re
publican sentiment is strongly in the
ascendant, as far as national issues
are concerned, and yet in face of this
strong majority, the democrats have
walked away with the plums of office
year after year; and are confident ot
being able to repeat the tnck this
fall. All of whioh goes to show that
the conduct of the democratic party
is more acceptable to the voters than
that of the republicans. The ignor
ing of the rank and file by the arrog
ant exeroise of power shakes the con
fidence of the voters, who in many
cases resent such action by turning
down the local nominees. That is
how it works. Let us keep close to
the people; take no step without
taking them into confidence. That is
the only path of safety and success.
To Voters.
Next Tuesday is the last day for
aliens to become naturalized in order
to entitle them to vote at the coming
election. There are very few coming
forward to take out their full papers
of citizenship this year. This back
wardness is unprecedented. All
naturalized after Tuesday next will
be precluded from casting a ballot in
November, as the 90 day limit prior
to the election expires on that day.
While persons entitled to citizenship
may get naturalized at any time after
that date, they cannot be placed on
the voting list of the present year.
The registration of voters is pro
ceeding very slowly. Persons mast
be registered 40 days preceding the
election. This limitation makes
September 27, the last day for
registration.

The Le Doux Case.
August E. Kitter, one of the jurors
who convicted Mrs Emma Le Doux
of murder in the first dergee, fixing
the penalty at banging, and who is
charged with misconduct in derroga
tion of his solemn, oath as a juror,
arrived in Stookton from the East
Tuesday afternoon. ([Friday at 10
o'clock Mrs Le Ooux will appear
before Judge Natter for sentence and
to farther argue the motion for a new
trial began July 9th last.
It will be remembered that upon
the 9th of July Attorney Fairall, re
presenting Mra Le Doux, moved for a
new trial and in closing his argument
presented two affidavits, one from a
man named Murphy and another from
a man named Smith, who eaob swore
that Kitter expressed himself in
strong terms, saying that be would
hang Mra LeDoux aud that her neck
should be broken. These two affiants
were cited to appear for contempt of
court and being found guilty by
Judge Nutter were sentenoed to
serve a term of two days in the
county jail each.
Attorney Fairail moved the court
immediately after the proceedings to
have jaror Kitter cited for contempt.
Judge Nutter refused at that time,
but instructed district attorney
Norton to have Kitter In court if
possible on August 3rd. In justice
to himself, perhaps, and to the pro
secution, Mr Kitter has been pur
posely advised not to speak with any
person regarding the unpleasant
affair.
At last screens have been placed
over the windows of the cell in the
woman's department ot the jail and
now Mrs Le Doux has possession of
the north cell on the San Joaquin
street side. She is allowed the free
dom of a small corridor and in it
obtains daily exercise. The screen
is of ordinary texture, yet withal it
will be impossible to obtain mor
phine from outside sources.
The Le Doux case is made of com
plexities. It is parhaps like any
other murder trial— hotly contested
by opposing attorneys, but more
hornets' nests have matured in this
case, according to popular opinion
than in any that have gone. It is
quite evident that more trouble is
brewing in the legal chaldron, but it
is impossible to gather its import—
for they all "refuse to speak."—

Silver Lake Dam to be Raised.
A surveying party of fifteen men,
in the employ it is supposed of the
American River Electric Company,
have been at work in the neighbor
hood of Silver lake, taking eurveys,
and doing the necessary preliminary
work for raising the dam fifteen feet
higher. The actual work on the dam
will not be commenced this season.
It is said it will require a large
force to finish the work in three
years. This raising of the artificial

will also innundate a large area of

RURAL WATER SUPPLY. ""
Its Sanitary Condition Not What U
OuK'l-t to Be.
When such great sums of money are
bc!i>g expended by city governments
that the inhabitants of towns may have
a sanitary water supply it seems
strange that the supply in rural towns
should receive little or no attention.
This latter population may seem rela
tively insignificant, but it comprises
about 40,000,000 souls. This means that
those 40,000,000 people are drinking the
water most available without a thought
of its sanitary condition.
These various sources of supply,
whether wells, springs or small
streams, are similarly unreliable for
furnishing drinking water. The statis
tics of mortality in the country are
very Indefinite, but even these show
that the rural population is not as free
from illnoss as it should be. And
though everywhere the rural death rate
is lower than the urban death rate, yet
the lowering iv the country has not
beeu as great as in the city. An exam
ination of typhoid statistics shows that
the death rate of other diseases is gen
erally lower in the country than in the
city, but the prevalence of typhoid is
almost equal to if not greater in the
rural districts than in the cities.
Several instances have been reported
which show the rural typhoid rate to
be ten times greater than the urban
rate for the same district. To particu
larize, a certain district iv central
Pennsylvania proves tin's fact. It is
made up of a rural population with 100
Inhabitants to the square mile. It Is a
region of fine farms, wild mountains
and woods, country residences and pic
nic groves. And in this valley there
has beeu as much typhoid fever as in
the city of Philadelphia.
Sad as this condition is, there seems
to be no remedy for it. The sources of
a city water supply are few and the
city government easily controls the
couditious affecting it. But what can
be done when the sources of supply
are numbered by the thousands? A
mint of money and an army of chem
ists would not be sufficient to give the
same care to the country supply that is
given to that of the city.— New York
Herald.
SNOWSLIDES OF ROCKIES.
Peril of Mountains Takes Its Toll of
Life anil Property,
Every year the life of a miner iv the
high mountain regions is menaced by
the avalanche or snowslide, and every
year brings its list of casualities and
of hairbreadth escapes. The story of
snowslides would fill a book and would
be a thrilling, tragic and In some cases
a grewsome one.
Men have ridden hundreds of feet on
the back of a snowslide and hnve es
caped unhurt. Others have been caught
and buried so deep and in such uncer
tain spots that their bodies have not
been discovered until the melting of
the snow in the following spring.
Some have been caught as they were
walking, but a few steps from the
boarding house to the mine, or while
emptying a car on the mine dump. Not
infrequently men have found them
selves temporarily imprisoned by the
entrance of the mine being closed by
a slide while they were at work and
have had to dig their way out.
A Chinese cook at one of the Idaho
mines stepped outside his kitchen door
for a moment and was caught aud
hurled with the slide 1,000 feet down
the hillside and his body was not re
covered tili the following spring.
Such Incidents denote the extreme
suddenness, power and velocity of the
slide. Little or no warning is given, a
roar, a cloud of snow obscuring the
sight of the real slide, and in a mo
ment thousands of tons of snow,
mingled with trees and debris, are shot
down the gulch or the slope of a moun
tain as from the mouth of a cannon.
In a few seconds all Is over and the
scenery of the little valley Is com
pletely changed.— Mines and Minerals.
What a Letter Will Do.
A proofreader, anent the importance
of trifles, read from his notebook these
absurd senteuees, each made by the
omission of a single letter:
"The conflict was dreadful and the
enemy was repulsed with great laugh
ter.
"When the president's wife entered
the humble sitting room of the miner
she was politely offered a hair.
"A man was yesterday arrested on
the charge of having eaten a cabman
for demanding more than his fare.
"An employee in the service of the
government was accused of having
stolen a small ox from the mail. The
stolen property was found In his vest
pocket."
Observation.
Au observant man in all his inter
course with society and the world con
stantly and unperceived marks on ev
ery person and thing the figure ex
pressive of Its value and, therefore, on
meeting that person or thing, knows
Instantly what kind and degree of at
tention to give it. This is to make
something of experience.— John Foster.
Tamed Poetry.
•'J. wish to submit a lyric, sir," said
the timid young man. "My friends say

"Humph!" said the cold hearted edi

We want one that, once printed, will
remain perfectly quiet and uot keep
our readers awake by singing itself at
all times."
The true strength of every human
soul Is to be dependent on as many
nobler as It can discern and to be de
pended upon by as many inferior ns

THE APACHES.
This Tribe Holds the Record us Bni
l lndians.
Sea reel j- a tribe of our American In
dians but what have engraved their rec
ord of crime and infamy high up on
history's wall, yet above them all is the
Apaches'.
From 1540 to 1853 New Spain aud
Mexico curried on a so called warfare
with these people. The Apaches were
vastly outnumbered by the Mexican
soldiery, but what they lacked in num
bers was more than made up in cour
age and craftiness. The Apache ever
bad a thorough contempt for the Mexi
can soldier, and in later years, when
they were fighting with firearms as
well as arrows, they would not waste
cartridges on the Mexicans, but would
kill them with arrows, spears aud
stones, saving their cartridges for other
and more worthy foes.
When this southwest region became
a part of the United States the Apaches
were a serious problem with which we
had to contend. Our government vacil
lated between a simpering peace policy
and the other extreme, their extermina
tion.
Their zout of wandering being inter
sected by the international boundary
line further complicated matters. They
would raid down into Mexico and theu
rush back with the plunder to our side
of the line, out of reach of the pursuing
soldiers. Next it would be a raid on
the Arizona side and a flight into the
wild mountains of Sonora. The Mexi
can government attempted to assist
their miserable army by giving a scalp
bounty, and for years they paid out
their gold coin for Apache scalps.
Scalp hunting became a recognized in
dustry. The horror of this was that to
the Mexican official all scalps looked
alike, whether from the head of a hos
tile or a friendly Indian. The price
was $100 for a man, $H0 for a woman
and $25 for a child. It is small wonder
that the tribe sank deeper into sar
agery than ever when we stop to think
that the men knew there was a price
set on the scalps of their wives and
children, and there was a horde of
human fiends, white in color, but more
savage than the savage himself, wrfb
were hunting them as they would a
cougar of the mountains. — E. S. Curtis

No Fishway.
Parties who have been to Silver
lake this season report a condition of
affaire at tbe dam there that calls for
prompt action on the part of the flsb
commission. Tbe state law enjoins
upon all owners of dams not only to
construct, but also maintain in
efficient condition, a flab ladder.
Tbe ladder at Silver lake dam is miss
ing altogether, or is in suob shape
that it ib useless. Thousands of trout
are said to be swarming in the pool
below the dam, and would return to
tbe lake, but cannot because their
means of ingress has been cut ott.
Tbe fish go over the dam into the
lower streams early iv the season,
and as tbe water fails later in the
season, they ascend the streams aud
return to tbe lake. If prevented
trom so returning most of them must
perish. The El Dorado Company
owning the dam will no doubt remedy
this defect as soon as the matter is
brought to tbeir attention.
Later reports are to tbe effect that
tbe fish ladder was broken down by
tbe flood waters in tbe early spriing.
This is not an unusual occurrence.
While the water is high it is imposs
ible to repair it, but as soon as the
water will admit tbe ladder will no
doubt be placed in working con
dition.

A WELL AUTHENTICATED FISH
STORY.
Fishy But Guaranteed Straight.
A party of Jackson pleasure seekers,
comprising Wm. Hpss, A. J. Laver
ono, M. Bruce and A. M. llambric
got back late last week lrom an ex
cursion of nearly two weeks to Silver
lake. They brought back, besides a
quantity of delicious trout, tbe most
remarkable fish story of the season.
It was received at first as a joke, but
the earnestness with wbich all con
cerned vouch for its genuineness, and
resent any intimation of a manu
factured yarn, has convinced most of
the listeners of tbe truth ot tbe
narrative.
William Hess tbe hero of this
historic romance, is the possessor of
a valuable gold ring, having a gold
quartz setting. He prizes tbe piece
of jewelry highly. It has aoquired a
habit of trying to slip away from the
possession of its owner. Twice
bjfore tbe escapades we are about to
relate it had figured in the "lost"
and "found" columns. He looks
upon it as of talismanio importance.
Of course he took it with him on
his mountain trip. And tbe first day
nnt he managed to get parted from
his mascot. This was at Pino Grove,
in feeding tbe horses, tbe ring is
supposed to have slipped from his
Qnger. At any rate, be picked up the
jewelry from under the horses' stall
tbe next morning. With this as a
starter, the tourist traveled on to the
lake without further misadvnnture.
About tbe second day after reaching
tbe lake, Hess started fishing in the
early morning from a bigli rock near
Piasse's. Thereafter his historic
ring was truant again. He thinks it
slipped from his linger into tbe
water. All the members of the party
bad knowledge of the loss. Some
hours afterwards Hess and Harubric
were fishing on tbe same streamlet
300 yards or more above the point
where tbe ring was lost. They pulled
out the biggest fish of the catch. It
fell oft the line, but one ot the
anglers grabbed it as it struck tbe
water. Tbe catch complete, ell
bands started to clean Hsu, Hess
grabbed for tbe big one. Cutting it
open his knife run against something
harder than flesh or bone. The
identical ring was found in tbe fish's
stomach, quartz setting uninjured.
There was no doubt it was taken out
all right— all witnessed that. Tbis
particular trout was about 14 inches
long, and weighed in the neighbor
hood ot one pound. How its maw
could take in a ring ot tbe Hess
dimensions is as much a puzzle as
tbe old old story of Jonah and tbe
whale. , But the boys are willing to
make affidavits to tbe main facts
given. The only missing link is that
no one saw the fish in the act of
swallowing the gold trinket.
Close Call trom Fire.
At 3 o'clock Monday morning the
slumbering citizens were awakened
by the shout ot "Fire, " and ringing
ot the flro bell. It proved to be the
double woodshed of G. M. Huberty
and P. Slavich, on the Hamilton
tract. The lots abut in the rear, and
each woodshed was built on the
boundary. G. M. Huberty noticed
tbe tire, which started in his neigh
bor's woodhouse. Both outhouses
were entirely consumed. With a
good force of water from his own hose
the flames were confined to these tvu
small buildings. Huberty used tbe
shed as a storehouse for some trunks,
containing valuable clothing. Kveiy
thing was lost. He estimates his
damage at $120. The Slavich resid
ence is owned by Chris Marelia. The
loss here will not exceed §30. There
was no insurance, as tbe policies
carried on the dwellings did not
cover the outbuildings and contents.
How tbe fire started at that hour is a
conundrum. A report is current
that ashes from the Slavich boarding
bouse were dumped in the outbuild
ing, and the fire got started through
that practice.

taking tbe crowds away from town,
to the detriment of the towu business
people. This year a new departure will

taking charge of tbe affair. The picnic
feature will be cut out. A committee

list footed up $500, which sum is
deemed sufficient to secure a tiptop
timo. An elaborate amusement pro
gram will be presented, the details of
which have not been fully decided
upou yet. A grand ball will wind up
the day, the net proceeds to go to the
union funds. Every effort will be
made feu make the celebration a
thoroughly enjoyable one for all, aud

MINING NOTES.
Mitchell— This mine is again runn
ing full force. Fourteen men are
employed, and the work seems to be
of a more svstematio character. Ten
stamps of the mill are in operation
steadily. There seems to be plenty
of rock, the trouble is to sort it.
The ore varies greatly in quality. It
is earnestly hoped by the residents ot
Pine Grove and vicinity that the
yield will come up to the paying
standard, thereby insuring tbe per
mauence of the .operations.
Climax— lbis mine is running on a
small scale. Only four flrr five men
are employed. Dr. X. B. Aitkeu is
absnnt at present, on account of his
wife's health, but is expected to
return to the mine in a few days.
Lucas This mine is situated on
the Calaveras side of the river, and is
being operated by a company, whicb
also runs the old Tripp mill ot ten
stamps on the Amador side. An
eight foot vein has been exposed,
carrying some free gold and a fairly
good percentage of sulphurets. The
quartz mill is being operated on this
ore, and it is hoped the yield will
come up to the remunerative stand
ard.
Fishing Party Returned.
Tbeo. Crocker and wife, C. H
Crocker, L. Lamb and Herbert Meek,
returned Sunday morning from their
camping trip of six days. They went
clear to Silver lake, finding that fish
mR was not good in the streams lower
down. At Ham's station their horse
broke down, wind-broken by the high
altitude, and they had to borrow
another to take them on to the lake.
They saw tracks of bear, but none of
tbe king beast of the forest was seen.
They caught sight of a mountain
lion. Fishing was excellent in all
the streams emptying into the lake.
In all they captuied between 40 and
50 dozen— sufficient not only to satisfy
their own appetites, invigorated by the
mountain air, but also to bring home
some ten dozen of tbe speckled
beauties to distribute among their
friends. They had a thoroughly en
joyable trip. At Ham's station they
found their disabled horse had fully
recovered his breath, and he made
the home run from there without
further protest. The Ledger acknow
ledges with fear and trembling the
receipt of a fine mess of trout us the
result of this trip, remembering the
"dear deer case" ot not long ago.
Perhaps, they have smuggled some
thing into our fool game laws against
editors enjoying at any season moun
tain trout not actually caught by
them. If so we own square up to the
line tbis time, and are ready to go to
jail for the offending.

disorder of the heart. For a month
previous to his death he had suffered
a number of sinking spells. He was
a native of Turin, Lewis county, \.
V., where he was born Sept. 23, 1828,
making him 77 years, 10 months and
4 days old. In youth he learned the
printer's trade. About 1852 he came to
California, traveling by way of the
Isthmus of Panama, and at San
Francisco went to work at his trade,
going into business with others.
While thus engaged in business a
destructive fire swept away every
printing office in the city. His firm
learned of an office stored on board a
ship lying in the bay, which they
immediately procured, with it tor a
time doing a very lucrative business.
Hfl had the honor of printing the
first paper announcing the admission
of California as a state into tbe
Union, the first copy of which was
sold tor 85. He remained but a few
years in San Francisco, and when
he left he came to Amador county,
where he has resided in tbe neighbor
hood of Drytown and in Amador City
for over 50 years. For a short time he
owned the Central House ranch. He
had lived in Amador City about 32
yearg, his occupation being that of a
carpenter.
The funeral services were held at
his home on Sunday afternoon, being
conducted by Rev. Hugh Baker,
pastoi of the Methodist Episcopal
church. He was a member of the
Knights of Pythias, from the member
ship of which order the pall-bearors
were selected. The Knights accom
panied the remains to Oak Knoll
cemetery, where their burial service
was read by tbe chaplain, Thomas
Richardp. A large number of friends
in attendance at the funeral services
testified the esteem in which be was
held. Rev. Baker used as a text for
his remarks,3Eccleß. B:B— "There is
no man that hath power over the
spirit to retain the spirit; neither
bath he power in the day of death, and
there is no discharge in that war."
Meeting of Republican Committee.
The republican county central com
mittee has been called to meet In
Sutter Creek tomorrow, Aug. i, to de
cide upon the time for holding the
county convention for the nomination
ot county officers. Opiniou is divid
ed as to the advisability of an early
or late convention. Office holders
who expect to be renoruinated natural
ly wish the nominating body deferred
as late as possible. They can elec
tioneer beforehand just as effectually
as they can afterward. But with new
men it is different, and the republican
ticket will be composed mostly of
new material. To them, it looks like
a handicap to have their opponents
button-boling voteis, and exacting
promises weeks ahead of theii being
placed in a position to definitely
rustle in their own behalf. Whether
the delegates to the stato cunvention
shall be elected by the regular county
convention, or separately is also a
matter to be decided. As there are
five delegates to be selected, it seems
to us tbe simplest way, and tbe plan
that will cause the least friction, is
to keep this issue apart from the
county ticket question, and let each
township elect one delegate by direct
vote at primaries called tor that pur
pose.
In this state it is not necessary to
servp a live days' notice for eviction
of a cold. Use the original laxative
cough syrup. Kennedy's Laxative

The English Police.
In the conduct of the police depart
ment in an English city we find a
striking comparison with our Amer
ican notion of police work. In Man
chester, as In London, the policeman
is always the servant of the public.
As In London, he carries neither club
nor revolver. His duties are very
nearly the same as those of a Xew
York officer. It is in his method of
doing his work that the striking dif
ference lies. He is always quiet, al
ways neat, always respectful, even
deferential, in his treatment of the
public. Such overbearing manners as
we sometimes see in New York police
men would not be tolerated in Man
chester — or in London, for that mat
ter.—Success.

There were chauffeurs long before
automobiles. History tells us that
about the year 1703 men strangely ac
coutered, their faces covered with soot
and their eyes carefully disguised, en
tered by night farms and lonely habi
tations and committed all sorts of dep
redations. They garroted their vic
tims, dragged them before a great fire,
where they burned the soles of their
feet and demanded information as to
the whereabouts of their money and
jewels; hence they were called "chauf
feurs," a name which frightened so
much our good grandmothers.— Paris

COUNTESS OF WARWICK.
A STRIKING BEAUTY OF ENGLISH
COURT WHO IS FRIEND OF
WORKINGMEN.
Has Accomplished Great Philan
thropy, Foundling Girls' Schools in
Dairying, Poultry, Etc.— Prominent
In Politics.
England has at least one titled
woman whose wealth and position
have not proved sufficient to blind her
to conditions which surround less for
tunate men and women. She is the
Countess of Warwick, long the reign
ing beauty of King court,
and one of the most famous women in
two continents.
The Countess has recently come in
to prominence through her par.-.ipa
tion in the English elections and is a
strong advocate and supporter of Will
Thorne, candidate of the dock la
borers for a seat in the House of Com
mons. The Countess strongly sup
ports the contention of the laboring
element for a labor party in parliament
and gowned in the most bewitching of
Parisian frocks and in a red automo
bile she has been stirring things up
pretty lively in the forty-five parlia
mentary districts in which repre
sentatives of organized labor were
running for the House of Commons.
SENT DELEGATION TO AMERICA.
This very democratic Countess re
cently sent a delegation of twenty-five
women to the United States to study
labor conditions here. Each ~as in
trusted with a different mission. One
visited stenographers and typewriters,
another went to tailor shops and still
another to the factories where young
men and women are employed and the
entire labor field was aaequately cov
ered. The Countess defrayed all ex
penses of the trip and is now using
the material which her delegation
brought back to her for speeches to
the laboring classes.
Not long ago the Countess addressed
a tremendous crowd of workmen. Her
stage was a tradesman's wagon and
hundreds of workmen went without
then- dinners in order to hear her
speech. She was given a great ova
tion, called the men "comrade and
THE COUNTESS OF WARWICK.
friends" and urged them to strain
every effort to get a labor party in
parliament
"You workers are the empire," de
clared the Countess and this with a
succession of spirited assertions she
made were lustily cheered by the la
boring men.
The Countess of Warwick is one of
England's most famous women. Be
fore the succession of her husband to
the earldom she was Lady Brooke and
gained the nickname of "Babbling
Brooke" for having told some t' ngs
in connection with the famous bac
carat party at Tranby Croft which
proved one of the most sensational
news stories of the year. The Prince
of Wales, now King Edward fU, was
a member of the party and a subse
quent witness in the case.
TO TEACH DAIRYING AND
CHICKEN GROWTH.
In the past few years the Countess
of Warwick has devoted nearly her
entire time to philanthropic and char
ity work. She once managed a linen
and lace store but the venture proved
unsuccessful. Later she founded a
school and dairy work and poultry
keeping for young girls, a home for
crippled children and a technical
school.
CANDIED FLOWERS.
England Has Begun Strange De
mands for Sugared Blossoms From
the United States.
One of the latest developments of
luxury is said to be the candying of
fragrant flowers. The notion is Mot
altogether new, for violets have long
been made Into confections for the
palate, as well as into boquets for the
olfactory organs.
At any rate, it seems that the fash
ion has acquired a new impetus of
late, and a candied violet is coming
to be regarded as aa acceptable "tonne
The Amador Ledger.
bouche" to be presented to a lady.
There is also, it is said, a demand for
sugared rose petals, which is being
catered to by some enterprising artists
in sugar. It can hardly be pretended
that flowers made into "sweets" are of
any medicinal efficacy, though damask
rose leaves have long held a recog
nized place in the materia medica.
Whether the violet has any thera
peutic qualities does not appear,
though the leaves (not the flower)
have just now some reputation — out
side the medical faculty — as a cure
for cancer. The best that can be
hoped for, if flowers are to be eaten
as well as to be seen and smelled, is
that they may in all cases prove to be
Innocuous. It Is a nice question
whether the perfume is always a safe
guide.
Perhaps the modern craze Is, after
all, only a form of luxury. A candled
violet or a dish of rose leaves cun
ningly prepared for the tea table could
not possibly enter into the category of
cheap sweets for the millions, and it
is understood that the sugar trust is
not interested.
BREAKS BY CONGRESS
Peculiar Mistakes Due to Tremen
dous Amount of Work Transacted
Just Before Adjournment.
In the hurry and bustle of "get
away" day in Congress, a few errors
slipped in to upset the calculations of
party leaders. One of these was the
signing of the agricultural appropri
ation bill by the President before thai
measure contained the signature of tho
Speaker of the House of Representa
tives. Of course this oversight was
corrected, but the question then arose
as to the importance of having the bill
signed by the Speaker and the Vice-
President Their signatures merely
certify that the bill has passed their
respective houses, the important fact
being that they have been passed by
the House and Senate. For this rea
son it is not regarded as being abso
lutely indispensable that a bill should
be signed by the presiding officer of
the House. All that is necessary is to
establish the fact that it has been so
passed.
Another "break" was the presiden
tial approval of the sundry civil bill
containing an item appropriating
$3,000,000 for a site for a new de
partmental building in Washington.
This item had been dropped out of the
bill in conference but the enrollment
clerks failed to notice the omission
and so included this item in the copy
of the bill laid before the President for
his signature. When the error was
discovered, a resolution was adopted
by both houses of Congress repealing
the feature of the bill making the
$3,000,000 appropriation.
It is not strange that these mis
takes occur, as all of the employes of
both the Senate and House during the
last few days of Congress have an
enormous amount of work shoved upon
them, so that when Congress actually
adjourns many of them are ready to

CANADIAN RECIPROCITY.
Northern Sister Would Like Such
Arrancement; But is Waiting
Move by This Country.
A letter from Ottawa, Canada,
states that the question of reciprocrity
between Canada and the Unites
States is by no means deau, as was
clearly shown by the recent debate on
the Canadian budget in a number of
speeches, which, while they admitted
that the United States did not appear
to care (or reciprocity, it would if it
could be brought about on mutually
advantageous terms, oe a good thing
for both sides of the line. Many of
the crown ministers and even Sir Wil
frid Laurier himself, the premier, and
described in England as the foremost
statesman in the British Empire, are
favorable to Canadian-American re
ciprocity, if it can be had. Sir
Richard Cartwright, minister of trade
and commerce, said recency that there
could be no better British policy than
to do everything possible to encourage
good relations with the United States.
Senator Lougheed, the conservative
leader in the Senate, stated that he
thought no higher work could b-3 found
by King Edward than to promote the
good relations of the two peoples, and
o bind more closely together the two
Anglo-Saxon nations. He know no
happier way of strengt .ening the bond
between the Anglo-Saxon peoples on
the North American Continent than
for the King and Queen to visit the
shores of North America at the pres
ent time.
If reciprocity is not visibly to the
front to-day it is because public
opinion in Canada reg rds reciprocity
as unattainable and the position of
the anti-reciprocity men who are for
the moment supreme, as unassailable.
Hence, and for no other reason, re
ciprocity sentiment is put on the shelf
until called for again, and an ostenta
tious appearance of indifference is
manifested in Canada which will be
stiffly maintained as long as the
United States government makes no
forward movement that public opinion
in the Dominion can accept as sincere
and based on a spirit of reasonableness
and fair play.
To those who are able to read be
tween the lines, the announcement of
the finance minister that the changes
to be made in the Canadian tariff.
when revision takes p.ace next session,
must depend upon such new conditions
as may have occurred, is obviously
meant for the people at Washington
who stand in the way of reciprocity,
and those in London who have blocked
a mutual preference between the
mother country and Canada. It is a
warning and may mean much, or little,
as circumstances or conditions dictate.
JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY, CAL., AUGUST 3, 1906.
A GROCERY IN CONGRESS.
REPRESENTATIVE MANN PLAYS
SALESMAN AND DRUGGIST TO
UNMASK FRAUDS.
Short Weight and Fraudulent Foods
the Lure of Many Department
Stores and Mall Order Houses.
Honest Dealers Handicapped by
Deceptions.
When the pure food bill was before
the House of Representatives a few
weeks ago, intense interest was dis
played by the members of that body
in a "grocery store" established by
Representative Mann of Illinois. Mr.
Mann had been given a special privi
lege by the House committee having
the bill in charge to demonstrate the
manner in which the ordinary food
REPRESENTATIVE MANN.
products of the country are adulter
ated, and how the consumer is de
frauded. The space in front of the
speaker's desk resembled a small
section of a delicatessen store and a
corner grocery with cereals, jams,
jellies, tins of peas, tomatoes, corn,
prepared spices, bottles of whiskey and
wine, imnorted sausages, brandied
cherries and other edibles and drink
ables scattered over two tables.
Representative Mann proceeded to
demonstrate to the House through
these various food products the neces
sity for a national pure food law.
One of the first articles taken up by
the Congressman was the ordinary
condiment — pepper — which to the lay
mind is considered too cheap for any
manufacturer to spend time in adul
terating. He read circulars from nu
merous concerns offering for sale a
certain grade of adulterant which
could be used to produce pepper or
almost any other of the spices with
some slight modification. As he scat
tered a package of this over his desk
the members In the vicinity started
back in order to avoid the usual sneez
ing which follows the inhalation of a
small quantity of pepper. But they
were reassured by the "groceryman"
that it was not harmful, for while
it was called pepper it was nothing
but ground olive pits. He convulsed
the House when he read the price list
of adulterants showing that they were
offered to the trade for $20 a ton in
five-ton lots, and that at that rate they
were guaranteed to make the finest
black pepper which, as everyone
knows, is sold by the ounce. He made
the statement that even the pepper
berry itself was adulterated by a
cleverly contrived manufacture of tap
ioco colored with lamp black.
Possibly the most striking demon
stration of the afternoon was one with
a bottle of red cherries. These cher
ries, it was explained, were picked
green, and that after being bleached
out white by the use of a powerful
acid, had been colored the brilliant
red by the use of coal tar dye — a
deadly poison if used in large quanti
ties. Representative Mann dipped a
piece of white cloth in the "juice" of
these cherries, and it partook of a
brilliant red as though it had just come
from a dyers.
Olive oil, explained Mr. Mann, is a
product which is in most cases, adul
terated. In many instances the coun
terfeit is merely American cotton seed
oil — a wholesome and satisfactory
dressing for salad, but it costs about
% as much as real olive oil, and the
American buyer certainly does not
care to purchase a dressing for four
times its actual worth.
HIVELESS HONEY.
One of the freak exibits was a
bottle of "honey" which, in order to
complete the assurance of the buyer
that the article was genuine, contained,
as if by accident, the body of a real
bee, yet the whole mess was pure and
simple glucose, and had never been
near a hive, much less a comb. The
hive probably was a ten story fac
tory in one of the large cities.
A bottle of "Preezine" was exhibited
by Mr. Mann, who explained that this
remarkable article was guaranteed to
preserve meat from the action of the
air and stop decay. While he ad
mitted that it would stop the action of
nature on meats, he claimed that the
preservative itself was actually poison
ous, containing sulphide of s«da with
red coal tar dye and cauld not be
used safely upon human food.
The public is unwittingly defrauded
to a great extent through short weight
and short measure in package goods,
explained Mr. Mann, aid he insisted
that the manufacturers should be com
pelled to state on the label the quan
tity contained in the bottle or carton.
In line with this was a dramatic dem
onstration when tho Ohioniro pure food
expert held up before the House a
THE WHITE
COMPANY
bottle supposed to contain a quart of
vinegar, which when poured into a
large graduate did not nearly reach the
quart mark thereon — in fact was three
inches below it. Raisins, currants and
numerous other articles of food are
apparently put up in pound packages
and so the buyer considers, but in fact
few of those on the market really con
tain a full pound.
DEPARTMENT STORE BARGAINS.
% "It is the department stores and
mail order houses," said the demon
strator, "which make profit from short
weight cans and under-sized bottles.
We ' are seeking to protect the legiti
mate grocery and the honest canner
from men who are willing to make
money by depriving the people of
things they think they are getting.
All that we urge is that an approx
imate weight or measure may be put
upon each one of these packages and
then, if the public chooses to buy
a smaller package at a smaller price
it may do so, but the manufacturers
and dealers must not any longer de
ceive the people as to how much they
are buying."
BREAKFAST FOODS A DELUSION.
On the tables where Mr. Mann, ably
but silently assisted by Mr. Stevens
of Minnesota, acted now as grocery
man, now as druggist, and now as
bartender, there were a dozen or more
packages of breakfast foods with their
familiar labels. A reference to table
weights and skillful dropping of pack
ages upon a balance scale in front of
him enabled Mr. Mann to show that
in a great many cases the public paid
full price for an abnormal amount of
pasteboard box. In scarce any case
did the prepared food weigh twice as
much as the box, and in many in
stances food and package were in near
ly equal proportion.
Everybody knew, as Mr. Mann
stated, that 25 per cent of all the
coffee used in the United States is sold
as a mixture of Java and Mocha. He
was prepared to show from official
CLOSE AT HIS HEELS FOLLOWED A LITTLE WRINKLED WOMAN.
figures that while we used last year
more that a billion pounds of coffee,
and while about 250,000,000 pounds
were supposed to be Mocha and Java,
there were actually imported into this
country last year only a fraction over
2,000,000 pounds of Mocha and 10,000
000 pounds of Java, or approximately
less than 13,000,000 pounds, or only 5
per cent, of the popular blend. It is
staggering to know 95 per cent, of the
people who think they drink Mocha
and Java every day have been de
ceived, and yet the facts seem to be
rather plain.
Figures like these, however, al
though ordinarily impressive and con
vincing, did not attract so much at
tention in the House, because the
members were so absorbed in the prac
tical demonstration of the extent to
which fraudulent manufacturers of
food products have been willing to
go in the way of swindling the public.

CHAPTER XI.
For a time Sir Nigel was very moody
and downcast, with bent brows and eyes
upon the pommel of his saddle. Edricson,
Ford and Terlake rode behind him. Tho
four rode alone, for the archers had
passed a curve in the road, though Al
leyne could still hear the heavy clump,
clump of their marching, or catch a
glimpse of the sparkle of steel through the
tangle of leafless branches.
"Ride by my side, I entreat of you,"
said the knight, reining in his steed that
they might come abreast of him
"For, since it hath pleased you to fol
low me to the wars, it were well that you
should know how you may best serve me.
I doubt not, Terlake, that you will show
yourself a worthy son of a valiant fa
ther, and you, Ford, of yours, and you
Edricson, that you are mindful of the old
time house from which all men know that
you are sprung. And first I would have
you bear very steadfastly in mind that
our setting forth is by no means for the
purpose of gaining spoil or exacting ran
som, though it may well happen that such
may come to us also. We go to France,
and from thence, I trust, to Spain, in
humble search of a field in which we may
win advancement and perchance some
small share of glory. But what is this
among the trees?
"It is a shrine of Our Lady," saii
Terlake, "and a blind beggar who lives
by the alms of those who worship there."
"A shrine!" cried the knight "Then
let us put up an orison." And pulling
off his cap, and clasping his hands, he
chanted in a shrill voice: "Benedictus
dominus Deus meus, gui docet manus
meas ad proelium, et digitos meos ad
bellum." A strange figure he seemed to
his three squires, perched on his huge
horse, with his eyes upturned and the
wintry sun shimmering upon his bald
head. "It is a noble prayer," he re
marked, putting on his hat again, "and
it was taught to me by the noble Chandos
himself. But how fares it with you,
father? Methinks that I should have
ruth upon you, seeing that I am
myself like one who looks through a horn
window while his neighbors have the
clear crystal. Yet, by St. Paul ! there is
a long stride between the man who hath
a horn casement and him who is walled
in on every hand."
"Alas, fair sir !" cried the blind man.
"I have not seen the blessed blue of hea-
yen this two-score years, since a levin
flash burned the sight out of my head."
"You have been blind to much that
is goodly and fair," quoth Sir Nigel, "but
you have also been spared much that is
sorry and foul. But, by St. Paul ! we
must on, or our Company will think that
they have lost their captain somewhat
early in the venture. Throw the man my
purse, Edricson, and let us go."
Alleyne, lingering behind, bethought
him of the Lady Loring's counsel, and
reduced the noble gift which the knigut
had so freely bestowed to a single penny,
which the beggar, with many mumbled
blessings, thrust away into his wallet.
Then, spurring his steed, the young squire
rode at the top of his speed after his
companions, and overtook them just at
the spot where the trees fringe off iato
the moor ana the straggling hamlet of
Hordle lies scattered on eitker side of the
winding and deeply rutted track. The
Company was already well-nigh through
the village; but as the knight and his
squires closed up upon them, they heard
the clamor of a stridemt voice, followed
by a roar of deep-chested lauihter from
the ranks of tie archers. Another minute
brought tkeM up with the rear-guard,
where every man marched with his beard
on his shoulder and a face which was
agrin with merriment. By the side of
the column walked a huge red-headed
bowman, with his hands thrown out in
argument and expostulation, while ol^sp
at his heels followed a little wrinkM
woman, who poured forth a shrill volley,

of abuse, varied by an occasional thwack
from her stick, given with all the forae
of her body, though she might have beea
beating one of the forest trees for aM
the effect that she seemed likely to pro
duce.
"I trust Aylward," said Sir Nigel,
gravely, as he rode up, "that this doth
not mean that any violence hath been
offered to women. If such a thing hap
pened, I tell you that the man shall
hang, though he were the best archer
that ever wore brassart.'"
"Nay, my fair lord," Aylward answered
with a grin, "it is violence which is
offered to a man. He comes from Hordle,
and this is his mother who hath come
forth to welcome him."
"You rammncky lurden," she was howl
ing, with a blow between each catch of
hei breath, "you shammocking, yaping,
over-long good-for-naught I will teach
thee! I will baste theel Aye, by my
faith !"
"Whist, mother," said John, looking
back at her from the tail of his eye. "I
go to France as an archer, to give blows
and to take them."
"To France, quotha?" cried the old
dame. "Bide here with me, and I shall
warrant you more blows than you are
like to get in France. If blows be what
you seek, you need not go further than
Hordle."
"By my hilt! the good dame speaka
truth," said Aylward. "It seems to be
the very home of them."
"What have you to say, you clean
shaved galleybagger? cried the fiery
dame, turning upon the archer. "Can 1
not speak with my own son but you must
let your tongue clack? A soldier, quotha,
and never a hair on his face. I have
seen a better soldier with pap for food
and swaddling-clothes for harness."
"Stand to it, Aylward," cried the
archers, amid a fresh burst of laughter.
"Do not thwart her, comrade," said big
John. "She hath a proper spirit for her
years and cannot abide to be thwarted.
It is kindly and homely to me to hear
hei voice and to feel that she is behind
me. But I must leave you now, mother,
for the way is over-rough for your feet;
but I will bring you back a silken gown,
iE there be one in France or Spain, and
I will bring Jinny a silver penny ; so
good-bye to yon, and God have you in his
keeping!" Whipping up the little
woman, he lifted her lightly to his lips,
and then, taking his place in the ranks
again, marched on with the laughing Com
pany.
"That was ever his way," she cried,
appealing to Sir Nigel, who reined up his
horse and listened with the gravest cour
tesy. "He would jog on his own road for
all that I could do to change him. First
he must be a monk forsooth, and all be
cause a wench was wise enough to turn
her back on him. Then he joins a ras
cally crew and must needs trapse off to
the wars, and me with no one to bait
the fires if I be out, or tend the cow if
I be home. Yet I have been a good
mother to him. Three hazel switches a
day have I broke across his shoulders,
and he takes no more notice than you
have seen him to-day."
"Doubt not that he will come back to
you both safe and prosperous, my fair
dame," quoth Sir Nigel. "Meanwhile it
grieves me that, as I have already given
my purse to a beggar up the road, I—"I — "
"Nay, my lord," said Alleyne, "I still
hpve some moneys remaining."
"Then I pray you to give them to thia
very worthy woman." He cantered on as
ha spoke, while Alleyne, having dispensed
two more pence, left the old dame stanj
inp by the furthest cottage of Hordlo
with her shrill voice raised in blessings
instead of revilings.
That night the Company slept at St
Leonard's, in the great monastic barns
nnrt spicarium — ground well known both
to Alleyne and to John, for they were
almost within sight of the Abbey, ofBeaulieu. At early dawn they passed
across the broad, sluggish, reed-girt
stream — men, horses, and baggage in the
flat ferry barges — and so journeyed on
through the fresh morning air past Ex
bury to Lepe. Topping the heathy down,
they came of a sudden full in sight of the
old seaport Some way out from the
town a line of pessoners, creyers, and
other small craft were rolling lazily on
the gentle swell. Further out still lay
a great merchant ship, high-ended, deep
waisted, painted of a canary yellow, and
towering above the fishing boats like a
swan among ducklings.
"By St Paul!" said the knight, "our
good merchant of Southhampton hath not
played us false, for methinks I can see
our ship down yonder. He said that she
would be of great size and of a yellow
shade."
"By my hilt, yes !" muttered Aylward ;
"she is yellow as a kite's claw, and would
carry as many men as there are pips in a
pomegranate."
"It is well," remarked Terlake; "for
methinks, my fair lord, that we are not
the only ones who are waiting a passage
to Gaseony. Mine eye catches at times
a flash and sparkle from among yonder
houses which assuredly never came from
shipman's jacket or the gaberdine of a
burgher."
"I can also see it," said Alleyne, shad
ing his eyes with his hand. "And I can
see men-at-arms in yonder boats which
ply betwixt the vessel and the shore.
But methinks that we are very welcome
here, for already they come forth to meet
us."
A tumultuous crowd of fishermen, citi
zens, and women had indeed swarmed
out from the northern gate, approached
them up the side of the moor, waving
their hands and dancing with joy, as
though a great fear had been rolled back
from their minds. At their head rode a
very large and solemn man with a long
chin and drooping lip. He wore a fur
tippet round his neck and a heavy gold
chain over it, with a medallion which
dangled in front of him.
"Welcome, most puissant and noble
lord !" he cried, dofling his bonnet. "You
ape in me the mayor and chief magistrate
of the ancient and powerful town of Lepe.
I bid you very heartily welcome, and the
more so as you are come at a moment
when we are sore put to it for defence."
"Ha!" cried Sir Nigel, pricking up his
ears.
"Yes, my lord, for the town being very
ancient, and the walls as old as the town,
it follows that they are very ancient too.
But there Is a. certain villianous and blood
thirsty Norman pirate knight Tete-noire,
who, with a Genoan called Tito Caracci,
commonly known as Spade-beard, hath
been a mighty scourge upon these
coasts. Indeed, my lord, they are very
cruel and black-hearted men, graceless
and ruthless. They have come in two
great galleys, with two banks of oars on
either side, and great store of engines of
war and of men-at-arms. At Weymouth
and at Portland they have murdered and
ravished. Yesterday morning they were
at Cowes, and we saw the smoke from the
burning crofts. To-day they lie at their
ease near Freshwater, and we fear much
lest they come upon us and do us a mis
chief."
"We cannot tarry," said Sir Nigel,
riding toward the town, with the mayor
upon his left side; "the Prince awaits us
at Bordeaux, and we may not be behind
the general muster. Yet I will promise
you that on our way we shall find time to
pass Freshwater, and to prevail upon
these rovers to leave you in peace."
"We are much beholden to you !"
ciied the mayor. "But I cannot see, my
lord, how, without a warship, you may
venture against these men. With your
archers, however, you might well hold the
town and do them great scath if they
attempt to land."
"There is a very proper cog out yon
der," said Sir Nigel ; "it would be a very
strange thing if any ship were not a war
ship when it had such men as these upon
her decks. Certes, we shall do as I say,
and that no later than this very day."
"My lord," said a rough-haired, dark
faced man, who walked by the knight's
other stirrup, with his head sloped to
catch all that he was saying, "by your
leave, I have no doubt that you are skilled
la land fighting and the marshalling of
lances, but, by my soul! you will find it
another thing upon the sea. lam mastor
shipman of this yellow cog, and my name
it Goodwin Hawtayne. I have sailed
since I was as high as this staff, and I
have fought against these Normans and
against the Genoese, as well as the
Scotch, the Bretons, the Spanish, ana the
Moors. I tell you, sir, that my ship is
over-light and over-frail for such work,.
and it will but end in our having our
throats cut, or being sold as slaves to
the Barbary heathen."
"I also have experienced one or two
gentle and honorable ventures upon the
sea," quoth Sir Nigel, "and I am right
blithe to have so fair a task before us.
I think, good master-shipman, that you
and I may win great honor in this matter,
and I can see very readily that you are
a brave and stout man."
"I like it not," said the other stur
dily. "In God's name, I like it not!
And yet Goodwin Hawtayne is not the
man to stand back when his fellows are
for pressing forward. By my soul ! be it
sink or swim, I shall turn her beak into
Freshwater Bay, and if good Master
Witherton of Southampton like not my
handling of his ship, then he may find
another master."
The throng moved on, until at the very
pate it was brought to a stand by a
wondzously stout man, who came darting
forth from the town with rage in every
feature of his rubicund face.
"How now, Sir Mayor? 1 ' he roared, in
a voice like a bull. "How now, Sir
Mayor? How of the clams and the
scallops?"
"By our Lady, my sweet Sir Oliver,
cried the mayor, "I have had so much to
think of, with these wicked villians, so
close upon us, that it had quite gone out
of my head." .
"Nay, Sir Oliver, Sir Oliver!" cried
Sir Nigel, laughing. "Let your anger be
appeased, since instead of this dish you
come upon an old friend and comrade.'
"By St Martin of Tours !" shouted the
fat tnight, his wrath all changed in an
instant to joy, "if it is not my dear little
rnmo rooster of the Garonne. Ah, my
iweet coz, I am right glad to see you.
What days we have seen together."
"The clams and scallops shall be ready
within the hour," the mayor answered.
"I had asked Sir Oliver Buttesthorn to
do my humble board the honor to partake
at it of the dainty upon which we take
Borne little pride, but in sooth this alarm
of pirates hath cast such a shadow on my
wits that I am like one distrait. But I
trust, Sir Nigel, that you will i"so par
take of none-meat with me?"
"I have over-much to do," Sir Nigel
answered, "for we must be aboard, horse
and man, as early as we may. How
many do you muster, Sir Oliver?"
"Three-and-forty.
"Three-and-forty. I shall have work^or
•very man of them ere the sun set. It is
my Intention, if It seems good to you, to
try a venture against these Norman and
Genoese rovers."
CHAPTER XTI.
Leaving the lusty knight and the Mayor
of Lepe, Sir Nigel led the Company
straight down to the water's edge, where
long lines of flat lighters swiftly bore
them to their vessel. Horse after horse
was slung by main force up from the
barges, and after kicking and plunging
in emptT sir wns dropped into the deep
waist of the yellow cog, where rows of
Stalls stood ready for their safe keeping.
Englishmen in those days were skilled
and prompt in such matters, for it was
not long before that Edward had embarked
as many as fifty thousand men in the port
of Orwell, with their horses and their
baggage, all in the space of four-and
twenty hours. So urgent was Sir Nigel
on the shore, and so prompt was Goodwin
Hawtayne on the cog, that Sir Oliver
Buttesthorn had scarce swallowed his
last scallop ere the peal of trumpet and
clang of naker announced that all was
ready and the anchor drawn. In the last
boat which left the shore the two com
manders sat together in the sheets, a
strange contrast to one another, while
under the feet of the rowers was a litter
of huge stones which Sir Nigel had
ordered to be carried to the cog. Thesa
once aboard, the ship set her broad main
sail, the breeze blew, the sails bellied,
over heeled the portly vessel, and away
she plunged through the smooth, blue
rollers.
"By St Paul!" said Sir Nigel gayly,
as he stood upon the poop and looked on
either side of him, "it is a land which is
very well worth fighting for. -id it were
pity to go to France for what may be
had at home. You may bring my harness
from below," he continued, to his squires,
"and also, I pray you, bring up Sir Oliver's
and we shall don it here. Ye may then
see to your own gear; for this day you
will, I hope, make a very honorable en
trance into the field of chivalry and prove
yourselves to be very worthy and valiant
squires. And now, Sir Oliver, as to our
dispositions : would it please you that I
should order them or will you?"
"You, my cockerel, you ! By Our
Lady ! lam no chicken, but I cannot
claim to know as much of war as the
squire of Sir Walter Manny. Settle the
matter to your own liking."
"You shall fly your pennon upon the
foie-part then, and I upon the poop.
For foreguard I shall give you your own
forty men, with two-score archers. Two
score men, with my own men-at-arms and
squires, will serve as a poop-guard. Ten
archers, with thirty shipmen, under the
master, may hold the waist while ten lie
aloft with stones and arbalests."
Meanwhile there had been bustle and
preparation in all parts of the great ves
sel. The archers stood in groups about
the decks, new-stringing their bows and
testing that they were firm at the nocks
Among them moved Aylward and other
of the older soldiers, with a few whispered
words of precept and of warning there.
"Stand to it, my hearts of gold!" said
the old bowman, as he passed from knot
to knot "By my hilt! we are in luck
this journey. But it is time that we took
our order, for methinks that between the
Needle rocks and the Alum cliffs yonder
I can catch a glimpse of the topmasts of
the galleys. Hewett, Cook, Johnson.
Cunningham, your men are of the poop
guard. Thornbury, Walters, Hackett,
Baddlesmere, you are with Sir Oliver on
the forecastle. Simon, you bide with
your lord's banner; but ten men must go
forward."
Quietly and promptly the men took
their places, lying flat upon their faces on
the deck, for such was Sir Nigel's order.
Near the prow was planted Sir Oliver's
spear, with his arms — a boar's head gules
upon a field of gold. Close by the stern
stood Black Simon with the pennon of

the house of Loring. In the waist gath
eied the Southampton mariners, hairy
and burly men, with their jerkins thrown
off, their waists braced right swords,
mallets, and pole-axes in their hands.
Their leader, Goodwin Hawtayne, stood
upon the poop and talked with Sir Nigel,
casting his eye up sometimes at the
swelling sail, and then glancing back at
the two seamen who held the tiller.
"Pass the word," said Sir Nigel, "that
no man shall stand to arms or draw his
bow-string until my trumpeter shall
sound. It would be well that we should
seem to be a merchant-ship from South
ampton and appear to flee from them.' 1
"We shall see them anon," said the
master-shipman. "Ha! said I not so?
There they lie, the water-snakes, in
Kreshwater Bay ; and mark the reek of
smoke from yonder point, where they have
been at their devil's work. See how their
shallops pull from the land ! They have
seen us and called their men aboard.
Now they draw upon the anchor. See
them like ants upon the forecastle!
They stoop and heave like handy ship
men. But, my fair lord, these are no
niefs. I doubt but we have taken in
hand more than we can do. Each of
these ships is a galeas, and of the
largest and swiftest make."
"1 would I- had your eyes," said Sir
Nigel, blinking at the pirate galleys.
"They seem very gallant ships, and 1
trust that we shall have much pleasanee
from our meeting with them. It wouhl
be well to pass the word that we should
neither give or take quarter this day."
The yellow cog had now shot out from
the narrow waters of the Solent, and w.ts
plunging and rolling on the long heave of
the open channel. The wind blew
fleshly from the east, with a very keen
edge to it ; and the great sail bellied
roundly out, laying the vessel over until
the water hissed beneath her lee bul
warks. Broad j. i ungainly, she floun
dered from wave to wave, dipping her
round bows deep into the blue rdllers,
and sending the white flakes of foam in
a spatter over her decks. On her lar
board quarter lay the two dark galleys,
which had already hoisted sail and were
shooting out from Freshwater Bay in
swift pursuit, their double line of oars
giving them a vantage which could not
fail to bring them up with any vessel
which trusted to sails alone. Hish and
bluff the English cor; lons, black, and
swift the pirate galleys, like two fierce
lean wolves which have seen a lordly
and unsuspecting stag walk past their
lair.
"Shall we tnrn. my fair lord, or shnll
we carry on?" asked the master-shipmnn,
lookinz behind him with anxious eyes.
"Nay, we must carry on, and play the
pnrt of the helpless merchant."
"But your pennons? They will s»e
that we have two kniehts with us."
"Yet it would not be to a knight's
honor or pood name to lower h's pennon.
Let them be. and they will think that we
are a wine shin for Gaseony, or that we
bear the wool-bales of some mercer of
the Staple. Ma foi ! but they nrp very
swift! They swoop upon us like two
goshawks on a heron. Is there not some
symbol or device upon their sails?"
"That on the right," said Edricson,
"appears to have the head of an Ethiop
upon it."
" 'Tis the badge of Tete-noire the
Norman," cried a seaman-mariner. "I
have seen it before, when he harried us
at Winchelsea. He is a wondrous large
and strong man, with no ruth for man,
woman or beast. They say that he hath
the strength of six ; and, certes, he hatn
the crimes of six upon his soul."
"By St. Paul!" said Sir Nigel, "what
is that upon the other galley V
"It is the red cross of Genoa. This
Spade-beard is a very noted captain, and
it is his boast that there are no seamen
and no archers in the world who can
compare with those who serve the Doge
Boccanegra."
"That we shall prove," said Goodwin
Hawtayne.
"They will lay us aboard on either
quarter, my lord," cried the master.
"See how they stretch out from each
other! The Norman hath a mangonel or
a trabuch upon the forecastle. See, they
bend to the levers! They are about to
lcose it."
"Aylward," cried the knight, "pick your
three trustiest archers, and see if you can
not do something to hinder their aim.
Methinks they are within long arrow
flight."
"Seventeen score paces," said the
archer, running his eye backward and
forward, "i;y my ten finger-bones! it
would be a strange thing if we could not
notch a mark at that distance. Here,
Watkin, of Sowley, Arnold, Long
Williams, let us show the rogues that
they have English bowmen to deal with."
The three archers named stood at the
further end of the poop, balancing them
selves with feet widely spread and bows
drawn, until the heads of the cloth-yard
arrows were level with the centre of the
stave. "You are the surer, Watkin,".
said Aylward, standing by them, with
shaft upon string. "Do you take the
rogue with the red coif. You two bring
down the man with the head-piece, and I
will hold myself ready if you miss. Sla
foi ! they are about to loose her. Shoot
mes garcons, or you will be too late."
The throng of pirates had cleared away
from the great wooden catapult, leaving
two of their number to discharge it
One in a scarlet cap bent over it, steady
ing the jagged rock which was balanced
on the spoon-shaped end of the long
wooden lever. The other held the
loop of the rope which would re
lease the catch and send the un
wieldly missile hurtling through the
air. So for an instant they stood, show
ing hard and clear against the white sail
behind them. The next, redcap had fallen
across the stone with an arrow between
his ribs; and the other, struck in the Us
and in the throat, was writhing and splut
tering upon the ground. As he toppled
backward he had loosed the spring, and
the huge beam of wood, swinging round
with tremendous force, cast the corpse
of his comrade so close to the English
ship that its mangled and distorted limbs
grazed her very stern. As to the stone,
it glanced off obliquely and fell midway
between the vessels. A roar of cheering
and of laughter broke from the rough
archers and seamen at the sight, answered
b by a yell of rage from their pursuers.
" "Lie low," cried Aylward, motioning
w with his left hand. "They will learn
w wisdom. They are bringing forward
s shield and mantlet. We shall have some
p pebbles about our ears ere long."
T The three vessels had been sweeping
s swiftly westward, the cog still well to
t the front, although the galleys were
d drawing in upon either quarter. To the
l left was a hard sky-line unbroken by a
s sail. Alleyne stood by the tiller, looking
b backwards, the fresh wind full in his
t teeth.
" "What was that?" he asked, as a hiss
iing, sharp-drawn voice seemed to whisper
i in his ear. The steersman smiled, and
p pointed with his foot to where a short,
h heavy cross-bow quarrel stuck quivering
i in the boards. At the same instant tin
m man tumbled forward upon his knees, and
l lay lifeless upon the deck, the blood-
s stained feather, of a second bolt jutting
o out from his back. As Alleyne stooped
t to raise him, the air seemed to be alive
w with the sharp zip-zip of the bolts, and ho
c could hear them pattering on the . deck
l like apples at a tree-shaking.
" "Keep them in play, Aylward, with ten
o of your men." said Sir Nigel. "And let
t ten of Sir Oliver's bowmen do as much
f for the Genoese. I have no mind as yet
t to show them how much they have to
f fear from us." The master-shipman looked
a at the knight with a troubled face.
" "They keep their distance from us,"
s said he. "Our archery is over-good, and
t they will not close.
" I think I may trick them," the knight
a answered cheerfully, and passed his order
t to the archers. Instantly five of them
t threw up their hands and fell prostrate
u upon the deck.
" "They still hold aloof!" cried Haw
ttayne.
" "Then down with two more!" shouted
t their leader, "That will do. Ma foi!
b but they come to our lure like chicks to
t the fowler. To your arms, men
A As he spoke a roar of voices and a roll
o of drums came from either galley, and
t the water was lashed into spray by the
h hurried beat of a hundred oars. Down
t the pirates swooped.
T Tn heavy clusters they hunff upon thp
f forecastle all ready for a spring —
w white, faces brown, faces yellow, and
f fires black : fair Norsemen, swarthy
T Ttnlinns, fierce rovers from the Levant
m d fiery Moors from the Barbary States,
o of all hues and countries, and marked
s solely by the common stamp of a wild
llienst ferocity. Rasping up on either t \
w with oars trailing to save them from
s snfTipine, they noured in a living torrent
w with horrid yell and shrill whoop upon
t the merchantman.
B But wilder yet was the cry, and shriller
s still the scream, when there rose mi from
t the shadow of the cog's silent bulwarks
t the long lines of the English bowmen,
a and the arrows whizzed in a deadly sleet
n nmong the unprepared masses upon the
p pirate decks.
O One moment Alleyne saw the
g galley's poop crowed with rushing figures,
w waving arms, exultant faces; the next it
was a blood-smeared shambles, with
bodies piled three deep upon each other,
the living cowering behind the dead to
shelter themselves from that sudden
storm-blast of death. On either side the
seamen whom Sir Nigel had chosen for
the purpose had cast their anchors over
the sides of the galleys.
Fore and aft the archers had cleared
the galleys' decks, but from either side
the rovers had poured down into the
waist, where the seamen and bowmen
were pushed back and so mingled with
their foes that it was impossible for their
comrades above to draw string to help
them. It was a wild chaos where axe aiul
sword rose and fell, while Englishmen,
Norman and Italian staggered and reeled
on a deck which was cumbered with
bodies and slippery with blood.
The giant Tete-noire, towering
above his fellows and clad from head to
foot in plate of proof, led on his boarders,
swinging a huge mace with which he
struck to the deck every man who opposed
him. On the other side, Spade-beard a
dwarf in height, but of great breadth of
shoulder and length of arm, had c C a
road almost to the mast with three
score Genoese men-at-arms close at his
heels.
But help was close at h Sir Oliver
Buttesthorn with his men-at-arms had
swarmed down from the forecastle, while
Sir Nigel, with his three squires, Black
Simon, Aylward, Hordle John, and a
score more, sprang down from the poop
and hurled themselves into the thickest
of the fight. Alleyne, as in duty bound,
kept his eyes ever on his lord and pressed
forward close at his heels. Often had he
heard of Sir Nigel's prowess and skill
with all knightly weapons, but all the
tales that had reached his ears fell far
short of the real quickness and coolness
of the man. It was as if the devil was
in him, for he sprang here and sprang
there, now thrusting and now cutting,
catching blows on his shield, turning them
with his blade, stooping under the swing
of an axe, springing over the sweep of a
sword, so swift and so erratic that the
man who braced himself for a blow at
him might find him six paces off ere he
could bring it down. Three pirates had
fallen before him, and he had wounded
Spade-beard in the neck, when the Nor
man giant sprang at him from the side
with a slashing blow from his deadly
mace. Sir Nigel stooped to avoid it, and
at the same instant turned a thrust frc i
the Genoese swordsman, but, his foot
slipping in a pool of blood, he fell heavily
to the deck. Alleyne sprang in front of
the Norman, but his sword was shattered
and he himself beaten to the deck by a
second blow from the ponderous weapon.
Ere the pirate chief could repeat it, how
ever, Hordle John's iron grip fell upon
his wrist, and he found that for once he
was in the hands of a stronger man than
himself. Then came in truth a battle of
giants, such as is seldom witnessed.
Fiercely the Norman strove to disengage
his weapon, cursing angrily in French at
being thwarted by such an unlo for
antagonist. But Hordle John, with a
bull's bellow, bending his great muscles to
the unwonted task, forced the huge
pirate's sword arm slowly down and back
ward. Terribly the Norman struggled,
hurling his whole weight against his op
ponent in an endeavor to break the vice
like grip which held him.
Back and forth they flung and surged,
until, with a quick movement, -*ordle
John put forth a fierce effort, twisting and
forcing farther back the Norman's arm
until with a sharp crack, like a breaking
stave, it turned limp in his grasp and the
mace dropped from the nerveless fingers.
In vain he tried to pluck it with the
other hand. Back and back still the
Saxon bent him until, with aroar of pain
and of fury, the giant clanged, his full
hegth upon the boards, while the glimmer
of a knife before the bars of his helmet
warned him that short would be his
shrift if he moved.
Cowed and disheartened by the loss of
their leader, the Normans had given back
and were now streaming over the bul
warks on to their own galley, dropping
a dozen at a time, on to her deck.
But the fight had taken a new and a
strange turn upon the other side. Spade
beard and his men had given slowly back,
bard pressed by Sir Nigel, Aylward,
Klack Simon, and the poop-guard. Foot
l>y foot the Italian had retreated, his
armor running blood at every joint, his
shield split, his crest shorn, his voice
fallen away to a mere gasping and croak
ing. Yet he faced his foemen with daunt
less courage, dashing in, springing back,
sure-footed, steady-handed, with a shim
mering point which seemed to menace
three at once. Beaten back on to the
deck of his own vessel, and closely fol
lowed by a dozen Englishmen, he dis
engaged himself from them, ran swiftly
down the deck, sprang back into the cog
once more, cut the rope which held the
anchor, and was back in an instant among
his crossbowmen. At the same time the
Genoese sailors thrust with their oars
against the side of the cog, and a rapidly
widening rift appeared between the two
vessels.
"By St. George!" cried Ford, "we are
cut off from Sir Nigel."
"He is lost," gasped Terlake. "Come,
let us spring for it." The two youths
jumped with all their strength to reach
the departing galley. Ford's feet reached
the edge of the bulwarks, and his hand
clutching a rope he swung himself on
board. Terlake fell short, crashed in
among the oars, and bounded off into the
sea. Alleyne, staggering to the side, was
about to hurl himself after him. but
Hordle John's heavy hand dragged him
back by the girdle.
The vessels were indeed so far apart
now that the Genoese could use the full
sweep of their oars and draw away
rapidly from the cog.
"Look! Look! but it is a noble fight!
shouted big John, clapping his hands.
"They have cleared the poop, and they
spring into the waist. Well struck, my
lord! Well struck, Aylward! See too,
Rlack Simon, how he storms among the
shipmen! But this Spade-beard is a
gallant warrior.
"xiy Heaven, Sir Nigel is down !" cried
the squire.
"T T p!" roared John. "It was but a
feint. He bears him back. He drives
him to the side. Ah, by Our Lady, his
sword is throuch him !
The death of the Genoese leader did
indeed bring the resistance to an end.
Amid a thunder of cheering from cos and
from galleys the forked pennon fluttered
upon the forecastle, and the galley, sweep
ing round, came slowly back.
The two knights had come aboard the
cog, the shipman walked the deck, a
•irncefnl master-mariner once more.
"There is snd scath done to the con.
Sir Nisei," said he. "Here is a hole in
the side of two ells across, the sail split
through the center, and the wood as bare
as a friar's poll.
"By St. Paul ! it would be a very sorry
thins; if we suffered you to be the worse
for this day's work." said Sir Nigel.
"But how fares it with you, Edricson?"
"It is nothine, my fair lord," said
Alleyne. who had now loosened his bassi
net, which was cracked across by the
Normnn's blow. Even as he spoke, how
ever, his head swirled round, and he fell
to the deck with the blood gushing from
his nose and mouth.
"ITe will come to anon." said the
knight, stooping over him and passing
his fineers through his hair. "I have
lost one very valiant and eentle squire
this dny. How ranny men have fallen?"
"I have pricked off the tally," said
Aylward. "There are seven of the Win
chester men. eleven seamen, your squire
young Master Terlake, and nine archers."
I' And of the others r"
"They are all dead — save the Norman
knight who stands behind you. What
would you that we should do with him/"
"He must hang on his own yard, "
said Sir Nigel. "It was my vow andj
must be done." '
"How, Sir Knight?" he cried in broken
English. "What do you sayV — to hang —
the death of a dog. To hung?
"It is my vow," said Sir Nigel shortly.
"From what 1 hear, you [nought little
enough of hanging others."
"Peasants, base roturiers!" cried the
other. "It is their fitting death. But to
hang — the Seigueur — a man
with the blood of kings in his veins — it
is incredible."
Sir Nigel turned upon h : - heel, while
two seamen cast a noose over the pirate's
neck. At the touch of the cord he
snapped the bonds which bound hiai.
dashed one of the archers to the deck,
and, seizing the other round the waist,
sprang with him into the sea.
"By my hilt, he is gone!" cried Ayl
ward, rushing to the side. ''They have
sunk together like a stone."
"I am right glad of it," answered Sir
Nigel ; ' for though it was against my
vow to loose him, I deem that he has
carried himself like a very gentle anil
dfbonnaire cavalier."
It was on the morning of Friday, the
eight-and-twentieth day of November,
two days before the feast of St. Andrew,
that the cog and her two prisoners, after
running before a northeasterly wind, and
a weary tacking up the Gironde and the
Garonne, dropped anchor at last iv front
of the noble city of Bordeaux. With
wonder and admiration, Alleyne, leaning
over the bulwarks, gazed at the forest of
masts, the swarm of boats darting hither
and thither on the bosom of the broad,
curving stream, and the gray, crescent
shaped city which stretched with many
a tower and minaret along the western
shore. Never had he in his quiet life
seta so great a town, nor was there in
the whole of England, save London alone,
one which might match it in size or in
wealth.
"I trust, Aylward," said Sir Nigel,
coming upon deck, "that the men are
ready for the land. Go tell them that the
boats will be for them within the hour."
The archer raised his hand in salute,
and hastened forward. In the meantime
Sir Oliver had followed his brother
knight, and the two paced the poop to
gether.
"Once more, Sir Oliver," said Sir Nigel,
looking shoreward with sparkling eyes,
"do we find ourselves at the gate of
honor, the door which hath so often led
us to all that is knightly and worthy.
There lies the prince's banner, and it
would be well that we haste ashore and
pay our obeisance to him.
The horses both of knights and squires
were speedily lowered into a broad
lighter, and reached the shore almost as
soon as their masters. Sir Nigel bent
his knee devoutly as he put foot on land,
and taking a small black patch from his
bosom he bound it tightly over his left
eye.
"May the blessed George and the mem
ory of my sweet lady-love raise high in
my heart!" quoth he. "And as a token
I vow that I will not take this patch from
mine eye until I have seen something of
this country of Spain, and done such a
small deed as it lies in me to do. And
this I swear upon the cross of my sword
and upon the glove of my lady."
War, which had wrought evil upon so
many fair cities around, had brought
nought but good to this one. As her
French sisters decayed she increased, for
here, from north, and from east, and from
south, came the plunder to be sold and
the ransom money to be spent.
In front of the minster and abbey of
St. Andrew's was a large square with
priests, soldiers, women, friars, and
burghers, who made it their common
center for sightseeing and gossip. Amid
the knots of noisy and gesticulating
townsfolk, many small parties of mounted
knights and squires threaded their way
toward the prince's quarters, where the
huge iron-clamped doors were thrown
back to show that he held audience
within.
The two knights were deep in talk,
when Alleyne became aware of a re
markable individual who was walking
round the room in their direction. As he
passed each knot of cavaliers every head
turned to look after him, and it was evi
dent, from the bows and respectful salu

$10,000 for the worthless tract. Great
was the joy of the natives who were
limed up at the various bars, to drink
to the health of the "sucker." But
the sucker returned in alx>ut a month
with another capitalist from the North
aDd sold this worthless tract for $30,
000. But this was not all. Within
ninety days the second sucker brought
a third and sold him the timber alone
for $50,000. And then the local
bankers and conservative capitalists
kicked themselves for not thinking of
it.
For years people have been leaving
Arkansas and Missouri — going west
looking for opportunities. To-day
strangers are taking their places and
tinding money on every bush. The
new-comers are simply developing the
resources which the natives failed to
recognize.
This principle holds true of a ma
jority of Individuals in every com
munity. We are too near to see the
opportunities at our feet. We pass
them over and leave them for some
one to pick up.
The twentieth century for the United
States at least will be a time of con
centration rather than expansion. A
century of rural development and
home-building. As has been indicated
the people must get back to the land,
and Industrial institutions to reach
their best development must give the
worker a chance for a home.
The Value of a Good Garden.
Many people fail to realize the
great value of a thrifty, well-kept
garden. Even an inferior one is much
better than none. Vegetables are In
dispensable to a family, so far as
health is concerned, to say nothing of
the money saved by not having to buy
bo much flour and so many groceries.
It would seem that every man
should manage to obtain a piece of
ground and see that it becomes well
fertilized and enriched and then put
under a thorough state of cultivation
before trying to plant the seeds. It
only costs a little to buy enough seeds
for quite a good-sized garden.

CHANCE FOR FACTORY WORKERS
"Every Child In a Garden and Every
Mother In a Homecroft" is the
Motto of the Organization— A Hun
dred Children at Work in the First
School Garden at Watertown, Mass.
EDWARD T. HARTMAN
Secretary Massachusetts Civic League.
At Watertown, Massachusetts, there
Is being put under way what seems to
be one of the most sane and practical
solutions of many of the problems of
modern city life ever attempted in this
country. It is in line with the best
enterprises for solving the questions of
housing, sanitation, education and
morals. As such it should command
the attention and co-operation of all
constructive social workers.
The Homecrofters Gild offers garden
work and craftsmanship as a substi
tute for the street corner, the cheap
show and the saloon. And it offers in
addition health, contentment and a
substantial increase in income to the
workers. The Increase takes a practi
cal form in the shape of health from
work in the air, from fresh vegetables
and fruits, from a clean environment
and from absence of bad habits; from
money saved from useless pastimes;
from absence of doctors' bills and from
a direct return in the way of com
modities for use in the home or for
sale.
The founder and main supporter of
the movement is Mr. George H. Max
well, editor of Maxwell's Talisman and
founder of the National Irrigation
Movement. As a student of social con
ditions, Mr. Maxwell has concluded
that college settlements and similar
movements merely scratch the upper
surface of the problem and fall utterly
to get under it and crowd it out with
a better condition. His creed is,
"Every .child in a garden, every mother
in a homecroft, and individual, in
dustrial independence for every worker
In a home of his own on the land."
MEANING OF HOMECROFT.
The word "Homecroft" has been
coined by Mr. Maxwell to fit the thing
he has in mind. The Scotch word
"croft" means a very small piece of
land farmed intensively by its occu
pant but not large enough to yield him
a living and constitute him a farmer.
The Homecrofter, therefore, under the
conditions being developed, is a labor
ing man, clerk, skilled artisan or what
not, who supplements his regular in
come by, and spends his spare time in,
work on the land. His children may
likewise be employed out of school
hours and at other times when they
would otherwise be on the street or
forced into some one of the street
trades to help maintain the home. For
the children the advantages are ob
vious. Healthy exercise in the open
air for a purpose, fresh vegetables and
other products, and occupation, are
substituted for spasmodic exercise
under bad conditions, stale vegetables
or none at all, and the gang.
It can be demonstrated that the
ordinary factory worker on from one
— half acre to an acre of land can earn
actually more in the odd time given
to his garden than he does from his
regular work, taking It hour for hour.
The other advantages are evident.
THE GILDHALL AND SHOPS.
As a foundation for the Gild the
Wilson estate at 143 Main St. Water
such betterments, either already
demonstrated or anticipated, are
these:
1. Healthier hove surroundings,
air, sunlight, trees, fl -wers; room
for children to grow up without con
tact with the contaminating in
fluences of crowded city streets and
tenements.
2. Diversity in employment and
healthful recreation for the wage
earner himself, nnd 'wholesome op
portunity for his w-*e and c dren
to contribute to the family in
come, in the cultivation of an acre,
more or less, of ground. This would
enable him, especially, to keep his
girls at home, instead of sending
town, has been purchased and con
verted into a Gildhall and shops for
handicraft work. The land around the
house has practically all been appro
priated to the use of a garden school
and laid out in children's gardens.
The director of the gardens is Miss
Elizabeth S. Hill of Groton, who last
year conducted the school gardens in
Brookline and Groton. Over a hun
dred children are already at work and
many more, almost two hundred in all,
have applied for space. It is an inter
esting sight, and a poor commentary
on our public school system, to see
the wistful look of the children "not
in it" as they watch the fortunate ones
and inquire of the instructors as to
how long they will have to wait.
Many children not connected with the
school watch the workers and play on
the grounds, so that it has become a
children's center for the town.
The opening or the garden school has
aroused an interest among other pri
vate organizations in the neighborhood
and the Women's Club of Watertown
has established another garden school,
also under Miss Hill's supervision, as
is still another opened by the Women's
Social Science Club of Newton, whose
garden is on Jackson Road near Non
antum.
On the outer boundry of the town,
the old Emerson Place has been pur
chased and set aside as a garden
school for boys and even men who de
sire to do practical work. The plots in
this garden are large enough to permit
of practical experiments and to even
supply quite a quantity of vegetables,
which each gardener is allowed to ap
propriate to his own use. The only
requirement is that each gardener pro
vide his own tools and seed and pay
sufficient attention to tho instruction
and to his work to keep his plot in fair
condition and in harmony with the
garden as a whole. There is in this
garden plenty of space not taken and
it offers a unique and valuable oppor
tunity for any one desiring such work.
The garden is supervised by a young
man with practical experience in
market gardening.
WEAVE BEAUTIFUL THINGS.
The weaving department, the only
handicraft department as yet de
veloped in the Gild, is supervised by
Miss J. A. Turner, formerly with the
experiment station for the blind in
Cambridge. Miss Turner, assisted by
her sister, has several looms already
in working order and instruction has
been taken up. The aim of the work
in weaving, as it will be in other home
craft work, is not to have a weav
ing establishment for the production of
goods, but to conduct a school In
weaving and design where women In
the community may learn to do work
which may be carried on in their
homes. This, as in the case of the
croft work, will enable them to occupy
spare time, which would be otherwise
wasted or improperly spent, in con
genial, healthy and remunerative em
ployment. It Is hoped and believed
that such work will enable many
women who have to supplement their
income to do it In their homes and not
be forced into factories and other un
satisfactory conditions. A system will
be developed whereby looms will bo
supplied by and the product sold
through the Gild. By this method ex
penses will be kept at a minimum and
the highest profits accrue to the
workers.
HOME LANDS IN SMALL
PARCELS.
The more far-reaching and substan
tial feature of the movement is
the acquisition and subdivisiou of
land into small tracts for actual croft
purpose as outlined above. This close
ly resembles the schemes developed in
Hitchln, Port Sunlight, Bournviiie and

elsewhere in England. It will not be
out of place to outline the Bournviiie
plan which is identical in many re
spects and has been carried out to an
assured success. This model village
was started In 1879 when Messrs. Cad
bury Bros, removed their works from
them to tfife isctoTy- or shop.
3. Reliable occupation ari sup
port for the wage-ear jr himself, in
ease of a temporary loss of his regu
lar employment. An acre of ground,
intensively cultivated and irrigated,
will support a family.
4. Opportunity to set up, in the
homecroft, little handicrafts for the
products of which there is a constant
demand; such as special lines of
weaving, knitting, rugmaking, cab
inetmaking, basket weaving, turning
in wood or bone, instrument making,
manufacturers of leather, gloves,
etc., etc. The distribution of power
from electric wires, or the use of lit
tle gasoline engines, in village, of
homecrofters, may demonstrate that
the concentration of thousands of
workers in great factories is not,'
after all, in a great many lines of in-j

the city and erected twenty-four
houses for the workmen. Mr. lieorge
Cadbury, from long observation aud
experience, concluded that the only
practical way to solve the problem was
to take the factory worker out on the
land where he might pursue the na
tural and healthy recreation of garden
ing. Says Mr. W. Alexander Harvey
in his book on Bournviiie, "It was im
possible for working men to be healthy
and have healthy children, when after
being confined all day in factories they
spent their evenings in an institute,
club room or public-house. If it were
necessary for their health, as it un
doubtedly was, that they should get

fresh air, it was equally to the advant
age of their moral life that they should
be brought into contact with nature.
There was an advantage, too, in bring
ing the workingman on to the land,
for instead of his losing money in the
'amusements usually sought in the
towns, he saved it in his garden prod
uce — a great consideration where the
poorer class of workman was con
cerned." And again, "The cultivation
of the soil is certainly the best anti
dote to sedentary occupation of those
working in large towns. A primitive
Instinct is induged, the full value of
which seems hardly yet to have been
realized. Many believe, indeed, that
with its encouragement the abuse of
the social club and the public-house
will be materially lessened, and one of
the greatest social evils of the time
disappear. (The experience of Bourn
viiie certainly gives support to this
conclusion, for nearly every house
holder there spends his leisure in gard
ening, and there is not a single licensed
house in the village.)"
SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR
A HOUSE.
The houses of Bournviiie were built
with special reference to cheapness,
artistic development, sanitation and
convenience. At a cost of from $700
to $2500 each a much hipher grade of
home than the workers had been ac
customed to was provided. Rents
range from 4s. 6d. to 12s. per week,'
not including rates; and the death rate
of nineteen per thousand in Birming
ham has been reduced to six and nine
dustry, a necessity for the -ttainment
• of the best results.
5. A growth of co-operation, which
will give to the homecroft settle
ment all the advantages of the ci j
in schools, libraries, hospitals, enter
tainment halls, water supply, electric
lights, improved roads, etc.; while
the cultivation of each separate acre
or "croft" will be facilitated by the
co-operative ownership of the numer
ous expensive pieces of farm ma
chinery now to be found on the best
largre farms, but which could not be
afforded by the individual crofter.
6. The fostering of a sturdy, inde
pendent individualism, to ■ hich
nothine contributes so mnc as the
ownership of a home and a conscious-!:
ness that one can "make a living"
regardless of any boss. i
Concurrently with such betterments ]
tenths per thousand in Bournviiie.
The garden features in Bournviiie are
planned with much care, provision in
most cases being made for some lawn,
flowers, vegetables and fruits.
To return to the Homecrofters Gild,
there is one distinctive advantage in
Mr. Maxwell's plan, in that he aims
to attach to each home eno s»- land to
make it a feature and not merely an
incident in the life of the worker, and
he has added the crafts work for wo
men and for men in the winter. He
already has under way plans for an

centre of a square so as to secure the

the worker in direct contact with his
land. These plans are being prepared
by Mr. Allen W. Jackson, the archi
tect.
Something over fifty acres of land
have already been purchased for subdi
vision, and improvement. This will be
sold to workingmen for homes for prac
tically what it cost in large tracts, plus
the co»t of division and improvement.
A special plan is to sell homes to in
dustrious working men on a long
time, on the monthly instalment plan,
at a rate which will be no more than is
usually paid in rent, but which will
create a sinking fund that will pay
the purchase price and in the mean
time carry what will amount to an in
surance policy covering the amount of
the purchase price remaining due, so
that if the purchaser should die the
property would go to his family with
out further payment.
FOLLOWS SUCCESSFUL ENGLISH
FLAN.
The movement Is not intended to be
an isolated one as the shops and
gardens are open to any one who will
use them in the right way. Mr. Max
well feels that isolation has been the
cause of failure in such attempts and
that the people of the community must
themselves become a part of such a
movement if it Is to succeed. Here
again the scheme resembles that of
Bournviiie. There, though practically
:ill the houses have been built by the
management, only forty-one and two
tenths per cent, of the occupants work
in the village. Eighteen and six-tenths
per cent, work in villages within a
mile and forty and two-tenths per cent,
work in Birmingham. Fifty and
seven-tenths per cent, of them are em
ployed at indoor work in factories,
thirteen and three-tenths per cent, are
clerks and travellers, and thirty-six
per cent, are skilled workers and pro
fessional men. By this arrangement
a normal community life is main
tained. The Homecroft Gild is being
developed along the same lines.
OVERCOMING PHYSICAL
DEGENERACY.
The Gild is not making the mistake
of trying to make farmers pure and
simple out of city workers. Such a
hard nnd fast line between city and
country will always lead to failure.
Mr. Maxwell says: "Give the city
worker a home in the suburbs, where
he can have a garden and a poultry
yard, and where his children can have
sunshine and fresh air without stint,
and you have largely donx? away with
the terrible evils that are cursing the
denizens of the congested quarters of
our great cities — physical degeneracy
tuberculosis, and social, moral, and
political dangers too numerous to be
enumerated." Henry W. Grady de
scribed the antithesis when he said,
"The citizen standing in the doorway
of his home— contented on this thres
hold — his family gathered about his
hearthstone — while the evening of a
well-spent day closes in scenes and
sounds that are dearest — he shall save
the republic when the drum tap is
futile and the barracks are exhausted."
The Homecroft Gild has other plans
in immediate contemplation. Near
in the condition of the wage-earner,
the general carrying out of the home
croft idea would relieve the con
gestion of population in cities, and
greatly assist in their development
along those lines which are o much
better than mere bigness. A hun
dred thousand or a million people
living on small tracts of land, wi ' in
an hour's ride of a city would make
far more business for the city, of
every desirable kind, than the same
number closely packed in tenements.
The "homecroft" experiment not
to be limited to the settlement fost
ered by Mr. Maxwell near Boston.
The idea combines with its sugges
tions of social betterments the prob-
I ability of very satisfactory returns
Ito fte owners of vacant lands, near
cities, who may be disposed to ex
periment with it.
Phoenix, Arizona, a farm of one hun
dred and sixty acres has ibeen turned
into a homecroft village. The land is
especially adapted to raising vege
tables and is under one of the best
water-rights in the region. Five-acre
tracts are here given to each worker.
The new government reservoir on
Salt Kiver and driven wells on the
property, insure a permanent supply
of water for irrigation and therefore
unfailing crops.
These undertakings, while practical
and constructive in every sense, are
intended rather as models to show
what can be done in any community
in the country. Japan, with sixty
seven per cent, of her total population
working in part or entirely on the land,
has become a land of gardens where
hopeless poverty is almost unknown
nnd where tuberculosis is a negligable
quantity. America can take care of
its hopeless thousands in the same
way, first by putting hope into them
and then by putting them where they
may attain it. It is to the promoters
of our great industries that we must
look for help in great part, but public
sentiment and sympathy will move the
promoters and reach the problem.
The Homecrofters Gild promises a
start which ought to weld together the
country and the city into one inde
structible whole and, supplemented by
proper charity administration and sane
vagrancy laws, remove entirely the
possibility even of a "submerged
tenth."
Parking for the Town.
The town parks, or the town or
village square are the lungs of its
citizens.
If the town is growing, it is none too
soon to start a movement to provide
for the securing of ample town park
ing. The land is increasing; when the
town has doubled and has become a
small city, it will not be so easy to
secure sites, readily accessible to the
people, without paying an exorbitant
price. Secure first the land; it is not
important that a large amount of
money should be at once expended
upon its beautification, possibly it
needs but little, since nature may have
made it more beautiful than can man.
It is not necessary that it should be
transformed into carpet beds of
liowers and trimly kept lawns. If it
affords sunlight and a green relic" of
grass and trees for the eye, it becomes
a civilizer and an equalizer, for the
poor as well as the wealthy, a resting
place where a man may forget, for
the "time, some of his struggles and
his anxieties in a contemplation of
what God has made.
The park should be kept, In fact, as
natural as is consistent with its use as
such. It is never too early, however,
to secure Its site, with a view to the
building up of the community, when
land values will necessarily increase.
Distribution of Immigrants the
Solution.
It there were only some practicable
way of distributing Immigration more
equally among all the ports of the
country the congestion and segre
gation phases of this problem would be
nearer solution. It can be accom
plished in but a small degree, since it
will only be done if answering an
economic demand, as In the case of
the Galveston-Bremen service. Wise
and well organized effort to Induce
immigrants to pass through the large
ports by finding and insuring them
employment in the interior and by in
forming them of opportunities else
where, will do much to improve con
ditions. The self-interest of states,
many of which maintain immigration
agencies, might also be brought more
generally Into play to attract the In
dustrious and ambitious new comers
to their farms and smaller towns.
Improving School Grounds.
In Rochester, N. V., the school
authorities grade and sod the school
yards, while the shrubbery and other
planting is by private effort In con
junction with the school children.
Ample land is furnished for decorative
playground purposes, and most exemp
lary results have been obtained.

scarcely a nameable limit to the pro
duction of potatoes.
WOULD USE UP WASTE
PRODUCTS.
Potatoes, beets, corn — the stalßs as
well as the grain — and the waste pro
ducts of our molasses factories may
run our engines, cook our meals, heat
and light our homes. The present tax
of $1.10 per gallon on commercial al
cohol renders its use for power, fuel
and light absolutely out of the ques
tion, although for these purposes it
can be manufactured at less than 10
cents a gallon. At this rate it can sup
plant both gasoline and kerosene, than
which it is also safer and much
cleaner. The only opponents of the
bill were the wood alcohol and Stand
ard Oil interests, which would be the
losers. Farmers, especially, insisted
npon its passage.
The white potato can readily heat,
light and furnish power for our
Northern states; the sweet y" to,
the yam and the waste from the
molasses factory can do the same for
our Southern states, while in the great
West the sugar beet and Indian corn
can turn the wueels of the factory,
farm and conveyance and banish from
the home the chill of winter or the
blackness of night. Such is the state
ment of Prof. H. W. Wiley, Chief of
the government's bureau of chemistry.

heating, cooking and lighting. A bush
el of potatoes will produce 0.85 gal
lons of alcohol. We now raise po
tatoes almost exclusively for human
food, and we plant only those varieties
which have the finest flavor for tfc >
table, independent of their yield per
acre. But there are potatoes yielding
many more bushels per ai ; than
these esteemed for food. They are
such as are grown for cattle food in
parts of the old world where corn is
scarce. Secretary of Agriculture Wil
son estimates that there would be no
difficulty in obtaining 500 gallons of
alcohol per acre from such a variety.
Potatoes can now be grown here as
a commercial crop only within a short
distance from market. It does not
pi-j to haul them far. But as soon as
they can be used as a source of heat,
light and power, factories wil spring
up in country neighborhoods where
coal is now expensive, and large areas
of potatoes will be grown for their
g ;test possible yield of alcohol. The
sweet potato and yam would furnish
about the same proportions of alcohol
as the white potato.
ALCOHOL FROM CORN AND
. STALKS.
An acre of corn — fifty bushels— will
furnish 130 gallons of absolute alcohol:

produces much more alcohol than an
acre of corn, when only the grain of
the latter is taken into consideration.
But corn stalks if harvested before
they dry out contain large quantities
of sugar and starch, enough to pro
duce 100 gallons of commercial alco
hol per acre, according to the estimate
of Secretary Wilson. In 100,000,000
acres of Indian corn the making of ten
billion gallons of this alcohol therefore
go largely to waste annually. Secret* y
Wilson predicts that the time is com
ing when we will utilize this im. -nse
source of energy. According to Dr.
Wiley the fermantable material in the
stalks could be removed by the presses
now used to extract the juice of sugar
cane. And speaking of commercial
alcohol from corn, it might be of in
terest to add a statement from Dr
Wiley, that twenty times more power
can be obtained by burning the alcohol
in corn than by burning the corn it
self — as has been done in the West
in times of coal famine. It is also
estimated that the value of the by
products of corn after the industrial
alcohol is extracted will pay the cost
of distillation.
SUGAR BEETS AND MOLASSES.
An acre of sugar beets will produce
224 gallons of alcohol. Our vast irri
gation projects in the West are water
ing lands which will soon produce
sugar beets more profitably, perhaps,
than any other crops and the molasses
from these crops can readily be turned
into alcohol. A waste product of the
ca c sugar mill, known as "base mo
lasses," would be another available
source of our commercial alcohol sup
ply. Millions of gallons of this pro
duced in all the Central and South
American countries and the West In

The alcohol made from It has a dis
agreeable odor and taste. But if re
pulsive matter must be added to 't
to make it undrlnka' a:.i tax-free
under the new bill. It will serve as
well as any other alcohol thus manu
factured for power, heat and light.
Already In Cuba such alcohol from
this base molasses is being made at
10 cents per gallon. The base mo
lasses Itself can be had at New York
at 3 cents a gallon. A similar grade
of base molasses is turned out as a
by-product by our beet sugar factories.
Ten factories of Michigan send their
produce to a distillery In that state
and produce from It about a half mil
lion gallons of absolute alcohol. But
this by-product of our beet sugar fac
tories generally goes to waste in other
states. Yet we sit by and bemoan the
decreasing supply and increasing price
of coal, the diminishing supply of
wood, wonder where we shall turn
next for power, heat and light
whether we shall harness the moon
with tide motors or the sun with colar
engines! Moreover, the production of
eastern petroleum is falling off and
practically no gasoline Is being found
in the petroleum of Texas and the
West And yet, according to Dr.
Wiley, our farmers can grow any
amount of starch and sugar that may
be wanted for any purpose In the
world and not a pound of it would
take one element of fertility from the
soil.
CO-OPERATIVE DISTILLERIES.
That the farmers in all corn-grow
ing sections of the country should
establish co-operative distilleries for
the sole purpose of producing tuis ue
natured" industrial alcohol, is the
proposition of Nahum Bachelder,
master of the National Graug^, ....j
was pressing the passage in tue in
terest of the 800,000 farmers of his
organization. These co-operative dis
tilleries would be close govern
ment supervision, and the alcohol
would be rendered unfit for beverage
purposes before leaving the distillery
warehouse. In this way the cost to
the farmers of this material for light
ing, heating, cooking and motor fuel
purposes could be kept at the lowest
point.
In Great Britain alcohol made un
drinkable by the addition of 5 per at
of wood alcohol and a much smaller
proportion of mineral nnptha Is now
sold freely without tax. Since 1887
Germany also had untaxed alcohol for
industrial purposes. France, . witzer
land, Holland, Belgium, Italy, Russia,
Sweden, Norway, Austria-Hungary,
Tortugal and six Latin-American re
publics exact no tax on this "dena
tured" alcohol, already regarded as
one of the necessities of agriculture,
manufacture and general lndus+-v.
In these "free-alcohol countries" there
are being used many varieties of al
cohol engines, alcohol automobiles, al
cohol motor boats, alcohol frm
motors, alcohol lamps and alcohol
stcnes.
ALREADY SUCCEEDS IN EUROPE.
C CSprmnnT hns far surpassed In all
o of these inventions, which were largely
m mothered by necessity, for the father
lland has no natural gas or petroleum.
R Rut its broad sandy plains produce
f fheap and abundant crops of potatoes.
f f rom which every farmer n manu
ffacture a vast quantity of raw alcohol.
T Tnventors andseientistshave been busy
w with improvements in farm distilleries,
m motors, lamps, cooldn" and heating
'inpararns. Their "spirit motors" are
b being turned out in all forms
r right and horizontal, stationary, por
ttable and locomotive. Alcohol loco-
m motives pull trains of a dozen cars on
l lnrtre farms, smear plantations and
e engineering works. The army has h«d
b built ten horse-power alcohol "en-
g gineers' wagons," each with a speed
o of ten miles an hour, carrying tools
a and apparatus for a regiment Of en
ggineers.
T The cost of converting this 9ena
tured (or undrinkable) alcohol back
into its original condition would be
much more than for making pure al
cohol anew, according to Dr. Wiley.
He thinks the best method of making
it undrinkable would be the addition
of ten per cent, wood alcohol and one
per cent, of "pyridine." According to
the bill as it passed, the denaturing
ingredients are left to the discretion of
the internal revenue tax.
SOME NEW PARISIAN LINGERIE.
Colors In Blouses Very Fashionable.
Especially the Delicate Tints.
BERTHA BROWNING.
In the new Paris lingerie, the
fashion is to have sets of chemise,
drawers and short petticoat of the
same material and type, and all
trimmed in the same manner. Nain
sook and very fine batiste are the ma
terials usually employed for their con
struction, the mode of silk underwear
being for the time abandoned. There
are two new fabrics called silk nain
sook and silk chiffon, both cotton, but
of very fine weave, and which do not
lose their glossy appearance in wash
ing. These materials have much the
appearance of silk and In garments
made of them lace is profusely used.
The lace composes much of the upper
portion of the chemise and the sleeves
which are of bell shape reaching al
most to the elbow. These are open
A NEW UNDERGARMENT
nearly to the shoulder over the fore
arm, where they are loosely tied with
a succession of ribbon bows. In lin
gerie garments the square neck is
preferred to the round this year, and
this is always finished with a band of,
lace or embroidery.
The empire form is, of course, very
fashionable for chemises, but, while
it is a pretty cut, it needs to be made
of very fine material else its straight
form will lie in folds beneath the cor
set. Most chemises now-a-days are
shaped in under the arms so as to do
away with this extra width at the
waist-line. A pretty finishing to take
the place of sleeves and shoulder parts
on a garment to be worn with decol
lette dress, consists of ribbons which
tie on the shoulders and may be un
tied and slipped beneath the bodice
when worn with the evening gown.
The Japanese nightgown of quite
loose cut is a decided novelty. This
has rows of little tucks descending
from the shoulder and extending half
way down the figure. A double band
of insertion starts at the foot of the
gown, passes by the side of the tucks
over the right shoulder and around
the neck at the back, meeting in the
centre of the front at the waistline.
The sleeves are loose and flowing as
befits a garment of this nature. Few
nightdresses have collars, most of
them being finished with straight
bands of embroidery or lace.
CHARMING DRESSING SACKS.
Some very jaunty little dressing
sacks of silky batiste or nainsook are
being constructed. These are entire
ly accordeon pleated, except for a por
tion of the sleeve. Lace and insertion
surround the throat, and for those of
Empire cut, a band of the same marks
the high waistline in back and in
front rises over the bust to be fastened
with ribbons. Some of these lingerie
tea jackets have broad and elaborate
collars which reach over the should
ers.
Another new comer is the blouse
waistcoat of embroidered linen, batiste
or mousseline de soie. This Is made
without sleeves and drawn in about
the waist with a tare to adjust the ful
ness in front. These are designed to
be worn with lingerie suits of which
a long or short jacket forms a part
Lingerie petticoats are of increasing
daintiness. They are for the most part
elaborately trimmed, the top portion
being of sheath-like cut and fitting
without a bit of fulness. They are
completed with broad flounces of
tucks, embroidery and lace. Some of
these flounces show several frillings
of lace or embroidery, while others
are elaborate with hand-embroidered
designs.
Violets.
The roses I sent were red.
My rival sent her white;
My heart is torn with doubt and fear—
Which will she wear to-night?
I hear her step upon the stair,
Ah, Fortune, now disclose!
My lady comes; stand still, my heart!
Whose violets are those?
One Alore on Mary.
From Technical World,
"Mary had a little lamb.
Just thirty years ago;
The chops we had for lunch to-day
Were from that lamb, we know."
Q. E. D.— How old is Mary?
The Pope's Wardrobe.
A large number of women are em
ployed at the Vatican solely in keep
ing the Pope's wardrobe in perfect
condition. No spot or stain may dis
figure his garments, and, as he always
appears in white, even a few hours'
wear deprives the robes of their fresh
ness. Women are permitted to servp
the Pontiff in this one respect only,
us male attendants are not considered
suitable for the work. Only the most
delicate materials are used — moire silk
In summer, and a specially woven fine
cloth In winter.
THE MESSAGE.
"Listen," said Kaleigh, aud suddenly
seized my hand.
"That is nothing but the alarm clock
in the next room," I said.
He did not seem to hear what 1 said,
but kept on listening to the strange,
rattling noise, and I saw beads of cold
perspiration on his forehead, while his
hand turned cold as ice. Nevertheless
there was in his eyes a far away look
of expectancy, of dawning joy.
"It is nothing at all," I repeated. "I
do not understand what is the matter
with yon. Tell me."
"Oh, never mind," he answered, "but
surely you heard it as well as I.
Didn't you?"
"Well, then, the time has come. For
hours, days, years, I have expected It,
have ofttimes longed for, and still,
now, when it has come, it seems hard
to leave this world so suddenly."
"Nonsense," I said, "what has the
alarm clock to do with your death?"
He looked at me with the same won
derful expression In his eyes, and
said:
"Well, I will tell you what I have
never told any one before."
"You remember that Lora died tnree
years ago."
"She died at exactly twenty-three
minutes of five in the afternoon. Look
at your watch and see what tune it
is now."
I looked at my watch.
"Just twenty minutes of five."
"Yes, and three minutes ago that
alarm went off, just at the hour and
minute of her death."
I looked at Raleigh in astonishment.
"Well, even If that is so, I do not
see what Lora's death has to do with
you."
"With me! Oh! but you don't Rjow,
even my dearest friend. How should
you know that Lora was my wife.
Nobody knew It but ourselves."
"Lora was your wife!"
"Yes, my wife," he replied, with
tears in his eyes. "You know how her
father hated me and why. But she
loved me as I loved her, and »o we
married secretly a few weeks before
she died. I was not at her deathbed
and would not have known had not
the mainspring broken In 'at very
clock we just heard with just the same
peculiar noise. At the moment it hap
pened a feeling of deadly terror over
powered me. I rushed to her house,
but they would not let me In. I cried
that she was my wife, but they
slammed the door in my face, anjl I
swooned away.
"When I came to my senses again I
was here. How I got to my rooms I
do not know, but I do know that she
was with me and at my side, pale as
a ghost.
" 'Lora,' I cried. She turned to me
and said: 'Wait for me, dear, the clock
will call you.'
"'Lora,' I cried aga)n. Another
woman stood at my side. 'He is de
lirious,' she said. 'We must renew the
lcebag.'
"Now you have heard It just as I
did. The clock has called and I must
go."
"But, Raleigh " I began.
He interrupted me.
"Do not say anything," he whis
pered. "I know it and lam ready. I
have been waiting so long — oh, so
long. Good bye!"
He reached eagerly forward, as If
to embrace some one, but suddenly
fell back into my arms, his face trans
ligured Into the most beautiful ex
pression I have ever seen. "Do you
see her? There at the door! 1 am
coming, I am coming, my darling."
A tremor went through him and he
was dead. — The Oklahoman.
