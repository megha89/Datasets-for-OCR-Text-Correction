JACKSON. AMADOU COUNTY, CALItfO HHI A, n?U)AY. JANUAIIY 31. 1U08.
Stockmen Meet.
Monday morning the Atnndor and
El Dorado Htocktneti'a Association
met in the court house with C. L.
Culbort in tbe chair, aud W. E. Finn
acting aa secretary. About forty
members were presont, a number of
whom were from El Dorado .county.
This meeting was supposed to havo
been called in November but for
various reasons It was postponed.
The next rogular meeting will be held
in April. According tn an amend
ment to tho by-laws passed at this
suasion instead of meeting somi
annually, in November and April,
the association will bold ono moot
ing, which after some discussion was
deoided should be held on the last
Tuesday in Janunry. It was decided
to frame a petition to put before the
next legislature, requesting them to
make better regulations in regard to
estray animals. As the law stands
now, a man passing through one
county from another and losing some
of his cattle stands very little ohauco
of ever getting them back. A man
taking up an estray is supposed to
give written notice to the county
recorder, describing the animal, with
brands and marks, and when he took
it up. It the animal in not called
for within a stated time It is sold at
public auction by the constable, who
has postod three notices to that
effect. It was the opinion of those
present that there should be a state
official who would receive reports
from all the recorders of the estrays
that are reported to him, with their
marks and brands. It should be bis
duty to have a record of all brands
that are registered and in that way
he could notify tbe proper owner, no
matter where he might live. It was
also brought out that these estray
notices should be advertised 'in the
papers for a certain length jof time.
It was voted upon and passed that
tbe secretary be allowed $20 a year
for past services and tbe same amount
in the future. 1 Au amendment -was
passed that instead of always meeting
in Jackson, "', as was decided upon
when 'the "' body *_' wan 1 -' organized,' th*
members should decide at eaoh meet>
ing where tbe - next should be. ■ As
the Hret year has not yet elapsed the
next meeting will be held in Jackson.
A number of applicants were admitt
ed to membership. - , • "i
. As bad been announced, supervisor
t'linthpm of this reserve was present
and Instructed the members in their
rights, and * the regulations of tbe
forest reserve by tbe government, lie
stated that as soon as the association
had the required fifty-one per cent of
the stockmen in this district that
tbeie would be certain privileges
given to the body. With those who
joined the day of the . meeting, it
was thought the required number has
been secured. The secretary was in
structed to prepare a list of the mem
ership and forward to Mr Flintbain.
After all the business of the associa
tion had been thrashed out, tbe
boundaries of the ranges were gone
over and adjusted satisfactorily to
everyone.
The Public Cemetery.
One of tbe vital questions that
clamoied for settlement when tbe
city was incorporated was tbe con
dition of tbe public cemetery. It
never has bad no recognized head to
take charge of it and keep it in any
thing like decent condition. Year
after year it has been lett for some
one to start out with a petition .to
collect a few dollars to pay tbe water
iates, and keep the weeds from
obliterating tbe graves entirely.
Some time ago tbe city trustees ap
pointed a committee to look into the
matter. We presume they made a re
port, and that is about all that has
been done. No step bas been made
toward getting a .new burial ground
or to place tbe old one on a business
like footing.
Tbe matter of providing water fees
and meeting other expenses is again
under discussion. Encouragod by
the success be met with last year on
this mission, K. S. I'itois has. started
out to collect, aud has met with good
encouragement, lie says tbe water
rates are paid for the current year,
but 200 feet of pipe and three more
hydrants will be needed for the water
system, also a general cleaning up ot
brush and rubbish done, so that tbe
graveyard cau be placed In shape for
tbe usual exercises of decoration day.

Becomes Inventor.
Karl B. Hough, who is well known
in this section through bis connection
with the Eilers Music Company of
Stockton, has invented a patent valve
arrangement for self-playing pianos,
together with a big improvement on
the endless roll device for tbe music.
He has formed a company for the
manufacture of the devices. The
valve device is much simpler than
that now in use on tbe self-playing
pianos, and is not likely to get out of
order. The device for tbe endless
toll is much simpler and more effect
ive than the one now in use.
To Organize New Lodge.
Henry W. Osborn, deputy supreme
chief ranger ot the Universal Order
of Foresters, arrived in Jackson early

ing a lodge of this order in this city.

the large cities of the state. It offers
accident benefits of 92.50 per week
upward, according to tbe amount ot
insurance taken out, also total dis
ability benellts, and tbe full amount
of certificate at death. Mr Osborn
expects to remain bore for several
weeks. He has no doubt that a strung
lodge can be orgauized here, aud he
will stay uutil it is fully started aud
in good working shape.

A BANK FAILURE.
TheSutter Creek State Bank
Forced to Suspend.
Monday evening bnnk commissioner
John U. Lynch, arrived from Snn
Frauclsco, and the following morning
the windows of the Sutter Ureek
bank were closed, probably for thirty
days, or uutil the officers can show
the authorities that certain securities
the bank holds are of value.
Commissioner Lynch stated that
the lirat intimation the bank com
mission bad that there was anything
wrong with this bank was , in Decem
ber, whon that body called for a re
port from all the banks, Showing all
the liabilities and assets. ,,'JLbis report
was oorrecfc in every detail, but it
showed that the bank field too much
security of ono oonoern, the Ames
Manufacturing Company of Nues, a
bnsiuosa recently formed, by Jackson
Dennis, who is also, president of the
Sutter Creek bank and the one in
Niles. The bank commission has
made it a rule that no bank ahull
have more depositors' money invested
in any one concern than will amount
to twenty per cent of the capital
stock and surplus of the bank. This
bank has exceeded that amount by
more than 815,000. Hesideß, the
bank is supposed to have a certain
percentage of the. . depositors' money
on hand at all times. Uut probably
becauso of money stringency the funds
had fallen below this mark, though
they have been increasing the cash on
band during the past week.
Mr Lynch went to Niles on Wednes
day to look over the accounts of the
bank there, in which Jackson Dennis
is interestted. He states that practi
cally the same conditions exist there
as in Sutter Creek, that they have too
much of the depositors' money in
vested in one concern. - After looking
over the books of the Niles bank, he
says that he will know better just
what the conditions of this bank is,
but as yet the bank is solvent. But
if the market value of the stocks held
by the Batter bank are below what
they' are stated as being in the report,
then the affairs of the bank look very
dark. Jackson Dennis telephoned to
Mr Lynch Tuesday that be would
have sulUcinut cash here in a few days
so that the bank could be opened
before the thirty days were up.
Tbe report has been' current for
some time that everything was not
just right with the Butter bank. It
has been stated that business men of
that town would send their personal
checks to firms in the city in pay
ment ot bills of goods, and they
would be returned to tbe merchant,
because of the failure of tbe city
banks to collect on them. But there
was no run on the bank because it
was thought that the nonpayment of
the checks was due to tbe general
scarcity of money. The failure of
the Butter bank will have no effect
upon the other two banks of tbe
county, as they had an inkling of its
condition, and were not caught to any
extent in tbe collapse.
To those who had any insight into
tbe methods of this institution, tbe
failure did not come in the nature of
a surprise.
The bank has been in existence for
sometbiug like fifteen years. , It was
started as a private bank by Jackson
Dennis, and so continued until two
or three years ago, when it was re
organized' as the Sutter Creek bank,
with a capital'stock of $10,000. Jack
son Dennis was tlio president from
tbe start, and the piinoipal stock
holder. A bout two years or so ago,
the Miles bank was started, under the
Hiiinu president and managing bead.
About the same time, a brick com
pany, lumber oompany and meat
company wero started at Niles, and
tbe Ames Manufacturing Company
was removed from Halt to Niles.
According to reports, the various
enterprises were flourishing, and
held out the promisu ot making big
profits.
Tbe Sutter Creek bank did not se
euro a large amount of deposit funds,
business inou of that town and vicin
ity banked there more for conveni
ence, In the transaction of business,
rather than security for their funds.
A savings account was started 'to
gather in deposits. Five per cent
interest was the inducement offered,
and many jumped at the bait. To
tbe thinking man, this rate of Inter*
oat amounted to a confession of weak
ness Nevertheless all along the
mineral belt, fioinjl'lyuiouth to Jack
son, tbe alluring interest captivated.
Children confided tbeir little banks
there, tbe parents hoping to accumu
lated a nice little Hum by tbe time
their offspring grew to manhood or
womanhood.

CITY OFFICIAL PAPER.
FRIDAY „, JANUARY 31, 1B(8
THE SOUTH AND THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMIN
ATION.
Many of the republican politicians of the South are fully
alive to the novel situatiou that is likely to confront the dele
gates from the southern states in the forthcoming Chicago
convention. Notwithstanding the perennial cry that th
solid political front so long presented by that section is likely
to be broken, it is expected that the electoral votes of those
states next November will as heretofore be massed in the
democratic column. Republicans depend upon the other
portions of the Union for the necessary votes to elect their
candidates. In view of the keen rivalry for the republican
presidential nomination," the appeal is being made to the
republicans of the South to send uniustructed delegates. This
is the advice of far-seeing political leaders of both North and
South. This is not prompted by any desire to either help or
injure any aspirant for the nomination, but rather to safe
guard the interests of the party as a whole. The republican
party in the South is composed mainly of colored citizens
and the federal office-holding class. It is realized that the
massing of the delegates under pressure of patronage of the
administration in behalf of a candidate favored in administra
tion circles would be a dangerous proceeding. Including
Oklahoma, the solid South casts 169 votes in the electoral
college, and twice that number of votes iv the nominating
convention. Add to these the votes of the territories and jn
sular possessions, which are also largely under administra
tive influence, and the tremendous power which might be
exerted in dictating the nominee by delegates representing
sections which are not expected to contribute a solitary vote
toward the election of a republican president, become a ser
ious matter. The interests of the party are superior to the
claims of any presidential aspirant. The nomination ought
to be decided by the states which can be reasonably depended
upon to furnish the votes in sufficient quantity to elect the
republican ticket. It is timely and wise tc urge upon the
republicans to send unpledged delegates to Chicago, who will
be free to act as their sound judgment may dictate when the
situation is fairly canvassed on the ground. We believe it
would be just as well for California to take the same course.
The vicious criticism indulged in by a portion of the press
against the district appellate court for its decision in the
Ruef aud Schmitz cases has led some papers to swing to the
opposite extreme, by advocating that such unseemly stric
tures, tending to impair the respect due to the judiciary, be
made punishable as contempt of court. It would be a back
ward step lo adopt such a suggestion. The bullyragging of
judges when they render an unprejudiced and honest decision
in the face of popular sentiment, is to be deprecated. All the
same, to make laws tending to shackle [the press in the dis
cussion of judicial affairs would be a far greater calamity.
Why should not an interpreter of the law be as open to cen
sure as a lawmaker; a court as amenable to criticism as a
legislature. The freedom of the press is oftentimes abused.
That it has been outrageously abused for personal ends in
connection with the graft prosecutions in Sau Francisco there
can be no doubt. But to curtail the liberty of the press on
that account would be foil)'. The intelligence of the Ameri
can people be depended to discern between the honest and
dishouest critic, without any abridgement of the privileges of
the press.
Those behind the graft prosecution in Sau Francisco are
making a double-quick tumble in public estimation. People
are beginning to realize that their system of rewards and
punishments, of bribing one set of criminals in order to en
trap suspected bribe givers, and the fabric of deceit concocted
to that end, is as much a crime against good government as
the reign of graft itself. We have no respect for that sort of
reformation that merely removes one abomination in order
to set up another. San Francisco has been rid of the villain
ous gang that has fattened by doling out valuable privileges
for a price. That city is still morally bleeding at every pore
because the officials have stepped aside from the straight path
of prosecution seemingly for the purpose of carrying out
private revenges. The ways of Heney and Laugdon and
Spreckels are not very much "higher up" than those of Ruef
and his coworkers.

<^nptaln Henry Ininnn in his boolA
"The Old Snntn Fe Trnll," relates ni\
mmmlng Incident of the gallant pio
neer.
My own conception of Kit Carson
na n child wng that he was ten feet
high, thnt it would have required tho
strength of two men to lift his rifle,
that he usually drank n river dry nnd
picked the enrenss of a whole buffalo
clean na easily as n lady does the wing
of n quail. Years nfter, when li mnde
tho acquaintance of the foremost fron
tiersman, I found him a delicate, reti
cent, undersized, wiry man, the very
opposite typo of what my childish
brain had created.
One day while Kit was at tho fort I
enmo across n periodical that hnd a
full page illustration of a scene In n
forest. In the foreground stood a gi
gantic figure dressed in the traditional
buckskin.
On one arm rested an immense rifle.
Ills other arm was around the waist
of the conventional female of such
sensational Journals, while in front
half a dozen Indians' lay prone, evi
dently slain by the hero In the Im
possible attire In defense of the pre
posterous female. The legend stated
how all this had been effected by Kit
Carson.
I handed it to Kit. He wiped his
spectacles, studied the picture intently
for a few seconds and then said: '
"Gentlemen, that thar may be true,
but I hain't got no recollection of It."
A JOURNALISTIC HOAX.
Trick the Harvard Lampoon Played
on the Crimson.
Speaking of the Crimson, Harvard's
daily newspaper, reminds every Har
vard man of the Lamiwon's master
6troke— or joke— played on that digni
fied and unsuspecting sheet on Me
morial day, 1001. The Crimson had
announced that it would not appear on
that holiday, but inconspicuously, so
few were surprised to find their Crim
son at their door that morning as usu
al. Their surprise began, however,
when they scanned its contents. This
always serious sheet seemed to have
become most frivolous und irresponsi
ble during the night, for In its columns
all sorts of weird and fantastic state
ments appeared.
The news, though clothed in tho usu
al heavy, dignified Crimson style, was
wildly revolutionary in character.
Among the items that appeared were:
"A Plot to Blow Up Memorial' IJ^ll."
"Strong Men to Get the Varsity H,"
"Wellesley Crew to Be Guests of the
University" and most important of all
a notice, "Lampoon Celebration at 7
Tonight." Then the joke came out.
The Lampoon had published the fa-,
mous "fake Crimson," the joke was
known throughout the country, and
that night La'mpy's sunctumi was the
scene of lmcChiiualian revelry. When
the following year the Crimson editors
But up all night with Injunctions
against a repetition of the fake the
joke was again on them, for Lampy

Mississippi Oratory.
Jnsper county has been noted for the
high {,'rndo of eloquence produced by
the public men of that part of Missis
sippi. An appeal to the "mighty men
of Jasper" made by one of that coun
ty's great men when a candidate to
the voters who elected him Is as fol
lows:
"Mighty men of Jasper, if I can be
instrumental In the hands of my peo
ple In adding a few jewels to those
that now shine in Imperishable luster
on the queenly brow of our proud com
monwealth, ■vvjiose associated radiance,
like the lambent beauty of the star, is
to guide the footsteps of her children
along the paths of peace and prosper
ity, security and happiness, I shall
then have accomplished the ambition
of my life."— Mobile Register.
Superlative Beauty.
A Swedish newspaper recently In
vited Its readers to state in a few
words what they considered the most
beautiful thing in the world. The first
prize was curried off by an anonymous
answer, "The eyes of my mother."
More Imaginative was the reader -who
won the next prize by suggesting,
"The dream of that which we know to
be impossible."
The most amusing answer was that
which read* "The most beautiful thing
in the world Is to see a man carrying
his mother-in-law across a dangerous
river without making any attempt to
drop her in."
Proved Useless.
"When you wub little, was you
spunked like I am to make you good,
papa?"
"I was, my son, and spanked hard
too."

Descriptive Article
A Amntior county comprises area of
V Vis square miles. 1% lies on the wes-
U U'l'ii tlopa of Sierra Nevada mountains,
m mil embraces within its territory nil
t th" divcr-ity of vnlli'.v. foothill, Mini
h high mountainous lnnda.-
C Climato. — The climate of tha popu
llous portions of tho county li as geninl
a and healthful M ean be found anywhere
i in California. As climato Is one of Ihcl
m most valuabio assets of this favored
ate in attracting populations Amu
s stands second to no county In this re-
g gard." I' should, and no doubt Will In
t time, when Its climatic advantages arc
m more thoroughly understood and ap«
p predated, become i health resort not
o only for thoso In loss favored states,
b but for the residents of other parts of
C California. The temperature alone the
c central portion rarely falls below 30
d degrees above zero In winter, ami as
r rarely rises to 100 degrees in the sump
i in i. Snow seldom falls In the settled
d districts, find never remains on the
g ground for more than a few hours. Of
c course, in the high mountain regions
o of eastern Amador the snowfall is very
h heavy — which is characteristic of the
e entire Sierra Nevada range. Tho sum-
m mer season is alway accompanied with
c cool nights; permitting of sound, re
ffreshing slumber. Fogs are rare, cy-
c clones are unknown, thunderstorms are
i infrequent.
G Gold Mining.— Tho county, although
r rich in other sources of wealth, com-
p paratively untouched, is noted prin-
c cipally for her quartz mines. The
d deepest gold mines in America are lo-
c cated here, The Kennedy mine is now
t taking gold in liberal quantities from
q quartz extracted from a depth of over
2 000 feet below the surface, with every
i indication that the pay-ore extends to
a a much greater depth. ' Since the dis-
c covery of gold, tho county has contrib-
u uted fully $100,000000 to tho world's
s supply of the precious metal. The
m mines are still yielding at the rate of
a about two million dollars annually.
N Nearly all of this wealth is produced by
e eight or ten mines operating on what
i is called the "mother lode," stretching
c clear across the county in a north-east-
e erly direction a distance of twenty
m miles. The mines aggregato between
4 00 and 500 stamps, and furnish em-
p ployment for over 1000 miners. This
i industry is still in its infancy. The
u unexplored territory, even along the
m main gold belt, is far in excess of tbo
g ground that has actually been worked
tor prospected . The county offers to
- -day one of the most inviting, fields to
\ \be found anywhere in the world for the
i investment of cvpital in the fascinating
b business of gold mining, not alone along
t the mother lode, but also in the almost
u untouched mineralized country of the
e east belt, some ten or twelve miles from
t the main lode.
B Besides gold, we have copper, de-
p posits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
l limestone, granite, and soapstono or j
t talc— all undeveloped. I
A Agricultural Capabilities. — agri- (
c cultural possibilities equal, if not excel, j
t the mineral riches. The valley lands i
w will produce anything that can be
g grown in the most favored sections.
I In the foothill lands all kinds of decid-
u uous fruits thrive: also all kinds of I
v vegetable are raised where irrigation
i is practicable along tho numerous water
c courses. Further up In the mountains,
a at an altitude of 2000 to 2.500 feet, the
» »oil is admirably adapted for apples
a and potatoes. A ready market for j
m many times the quantity now raised of
t the3e commodities can be found tin tho
v various mining towns.
G Grape culture and winemaking are I
b becoming important industries, both i
t the grapes and wino commanding' a'
b better price than .the product of the I
l lowland. |
L Land is cheap compared with other j
C California lands. Improved farms may i
b be secured for one-fourth the price
c current in some places. Unimproved i
l lands can be had from $5 to $10 per |
. in. It does not require a fortune to
b buy a small ranch. There is room for
a a large addition to our agrlculural pop-
u ulation-. Vast tracts now dovoted to j
■cattle ranges might bo made the homes I
o of hundreds of prosperous farmers. i
Amador has a populaslonof less than
32000. Three fourths of this is concen
trated in a strip of thruo miles above
and below the mineral belt. *
Jackson, tho county seat, has about
2500 inhabitants, and isan incorporated
city of the bixth class. Other towns
iue Slitter Creek, Amador City, Dry
town, Plymouth, Volcano, Pine Grove
and Olota. lone City is the metropolis
of the valley section, a thriving town
of 1000 Inhabitants.
Thocommunlty is law-abiding. Edu
cational facilities are excellent. A
school house is within easy reach of
nearly every family. There is ono high
school, located at lone.
The assessment roll for 1007 is $5.
800,793, and the tax rate for both .state
and county purposes $2 on the $100.

tends 14 miles further to the raining

LETTER FROM
WASHINGTON
Wnahlnstoti, Jan. 17, IWIB.
Thero la likely to ho n very thor
ough investigation of nnral matters
by tho coininittoo on naval affairs,
including nn inquiry into tho truth
of tho recent published criticisms of
naval construction. This investiga
tion 19 likely to come In connection
with the new nnval bill introduced
hist week by senator Halo, chairman
of tho naval committee. It provides
that nil navy business nhall be tran
sacted liy bureaus, nil permnnent
boards being discontinued and the
executive, prohibited from creating
other staff otllcors, are to have actual
title and lank, but are prohibited
ftom holding command of any vessel,
such command to be exorcised only
by lino otlioers. Appointments of
midshipmen l'rom the naval aoadomy
are to bo made in order of merit at
graduation, not to exceed seventy
live in any ono year. At tho discie
tion of the president, otltcers can be
retired, on their own request, after
thirty years' nervine, and after forty
years must be retired uu application.
Otllcors who have served as chiefs of
bureaus shall be retired with the
rank, pay and allowances authorized
by law. Pay of all commissioned
officers, warrant officers, midshipmen
and pay officers in the navy and
marine corps is increased twenty per
cont and tho pay of non-commission
ed officers, petty officers, musicians
and other enlisted parsons in the
navy and marine corps is increased
forty per cent and suob increase is
exclusive of all additions in the foim
of allowances and commentations.
This bill gave ' occasion for rofer
euce to the recent episode resulting
in the resignation ot roar admiral
JSrownson, and "senator Tillman ex
pressod a desire that the committee
hold an investigation. Senator
Korakor desired the committee £to
ascertain what were tho precedents on
which \yere based the order placing a
doctor in command of a ship, as, in
his opinion, it is important to know
the ground of such action. Demand
was also made that the committee
investigate as to the truth or falsity
of the charges of faulty construction
of naval vessels. There was an evi
dent desire that the navel committee
should go into the whole question of
rivalry betwoen the statf and the
lino, which was brought to a climax
by the Brownsou resignation. Senator
Hale, chairman of the committee on
naval affairs, gave fair promise)} that
all these matters should be subjected
to scrutiny, and that witnesses should
be called. It is therefore quite cer
tain that naval matters will receive a
large share of the attention of con
gress at this session.
Senator Perkins has introduced a
bill to establish a light and fog signal
at the outer end of the San Pedro
breakwater at a cost ot 53G.000. The
light house board approves of such
establishment, as the signal will be
of use to coasters as well as to com
merce to and from the harbor of
Wilmington, will spring up
under the lea of the breakwater. It
is expected that the breakwater will
be completed in about a year. He
has also introduced a bill tor, a light
and tog signal at or near Punta
tiorda, to cost 560,000. This is also
npproved by the light house board.
iho light house board has survey
ed and marked out a plot of twenty
two acres at Point* Sal for a light
station, appropriation for which will
be usked later on 'in the session.
Work on the light and fog signal at
Curquinez straits will be commenced
soon, and an appropriation of SIO.OOU
will oe askod for to establish n light
and fog signal at Army Point, Suisuu
buy. Measures aie being taken to
secure title to tho site for a light and
fog signal at Point Cabrillo.
A bill has beou introduced increas
ing the number of lighthouse districts
to nineteen. The object of this is to
create three new districts, ouo com
prising Alaska, one our island posses
sions of Hawaii, (iiium uiul the
Samoan Islands, and one Porto Kico.
A bill hns been introduced in the
senate authorizing the president to
ostabiish grazing districts on the un
reserved unappropriated public lands,
which shall be undor the charge of
the secretory of agriculture, who will
establish rules tor their protection
and tor regulutlng their use for graz
ing purposes. Permits to graze
shall cover not more than ten years,
preference bolng given to home
steaders or occupants ot the range
who have improved ranches or who
have provided water for live stock
grazing on the publio lauds. Reason
able fees for such permits shall be
collected. The government of the
state or territory within which .the
grazing range ia situated shall ap
point a committee of four from the
users of said range, which committee
shall determine how permits shall be

United States attorney Devlin has
suggested thnt tho California code be
adopted by tbe government for tbe
consular courta In China, nnd senator
Perkins has placed this suggestion be
fore the secretary of state, that do
partmont having jurisdiction over this
court. At present, undor the law, con
sular courts conduct proceedings un
dor the enmmou luw, but as it is be
comiDg more nnd more difficult to de
termine what the common law mat
ters is, it is thought that all interests
will bo best served by the substitu
tion of a code,nud the California code
by preference, ns the greater part of
the commerce between tho United
States and Chiua passes through tbe
hands of San Francisco morchants,
who would nomn uudor the same law
on both sides of the Pacillo.
The annual ioport ot the interstate
commeice commission states that tbo
gross earnings of railroads for the
past fiscal year were 92,585,913,000,
averaging Sll,K>:t per mile of line.
Tho gross earnings of the previous
year were 8200,000,000 less, or 810,460
per mile. The oporating expenses for
1907 were 51, 740,097, 000 or 87,710 per
mile. Tbe net earnings wero $839,
915,000 foi lUO7 and 8787,420,000 for
lUOG. ln addition there was 5157,5E4,
000 from other sources, making the
total not increaso for 1907, 8997,350,
000. Out of this was paid in divi
dends over 52'J, 000,000 more than dur
ing the year 1906. This shows that
the railway systems are in a healthy
condition.
Senator Perkins has submitted to
the senate resolutions of the Cali
torniu fruit growers' convention re
cently held In Marysville, calling for
a national horticultural quarantine
law. Tbe matter will bo taken up in
tho committee on agriculture, of
which the senator is a member. .
tie has also brought to the atten
tion of the secretary of tbe interior
tho fact thnt. there is a controversy
between tbe United States and the
state of California as to the lieu
land for which California has over
drawn its account several hundred
acres. In consequence there are
many certificates outstanding for
lauds selected iv lieu of other lands,
but such lands have never been listed
by tbe United States to the state, and
patents can not be issued to tho
holders. An effort will be made to
secure a settlement of this case.
The report of the secretary of war,
just issued, shows 3,750 officers and
50,190 enlisted men in the army, a
decrease for the year of 4.428. The
sectetary calls to publio attention the
fact that tho number of soldiers who
tail to reenlist is constantly iucroas
ing, showing that the lifo of a soldier
is not such as to attract tho most de
sirable class of enlisted men. Such a
condition, he says, is radically wrong
and should be corrected. It is found
practically impossible to keep the
enlisted strength up to the standard.
Desertions are also growing in num
ber. Last year there were 4,522 iv
the regular army. The report has
this to say regarding the cauteen:
"The restoration of the canteen
feature ot the post exchange would
operate for greater efficiency and
greuter uoutentmeut. This is not bo
causo of the desire of most men foi
intoxicants but because of the dosiro
uatural to grown men for the free
exercise of their own judgment iv
matters left olsewhere generally to
the judgment of their kind. The
man of the necessary force for a suc
cessful soldier objects to treatment as
a child."

THE COAL SACK IN THE SKY.
It Is Visible Because It Contains Noth-
ing That Is Visible.
Immediately below tho lower stars
of the group which forms tho Southern
Cross there is a black pntcli in the sky,
dark, sack shaped and mysterious.
Scientifically accurate astronomers ex
plain that it is not a patch, but rather
something which becomes visible by
reason of the anomaly that It contains
nothing that Is visible.
The lay mind, preferring bald reality
to abstract truth, is somewhat startled
to learu that an object is seen because
there is nothing Iv it to see, but no one
can dispute the fact. The coal sack Is
visible because it contains nothing that
Is visible.
In other words, It is a vast hole ln
the stellar system In which there is not
even a pinch of stellar dust *o shed a
flicker of luminosity. It 13 typically
and absolutely tho quintessence of
blackness.
Because it is so, and in contradiction
of all preconceived notions, the human
eyo can see It without the aid of a
telescope or other Instrument.
Between the stars of the Milky Way
there are many little holes in the stel
lar system— little by comparison, that
Is to say— but oue must have telescopes
and patience to find them. One need
only cross the lino to the southern
hemisphere and locate the Southern
Cross in order to see the coal sack.
With the wealth of legendary tale
and fablo woven around the northern
stars by the highly gifted races gaz
ing on them through the ages that are
gone one is tempted to speculate what
tales ■would not have been constructed
around that fathomless mystery had it
appeared north instead of south of the
equator. "
When it rouses tho poetical impulse
within the brain of aboriginal Aus
tralians, what might It not have done
with the ancient Greeks or still more
ancient Egyptians? But they were de
nied It. The aboriginal uses it as he
uses most things, In a top3.v turvy fash
lon. To him thu world is a fiat plain
crowned with a dome shaped roof.
When a man c'.les he has to go up to
the roof and slowly journey over It
until ho can clamber down to the
flat again and squeeze through, once
more a num. The coal sack Is the hole
he goes through to get on to the roof,
and to get up to it Is a very long clluib.
The journey over the roof is also
very long, nnd It Is hard to squeeze
through when ho reaches the flat again.
So long does It take that by the time a
man has completed the journey not

white with age.
Wherefore tbe black fellow who has
made the journey rejoins his tribe as a

Biggest of All Animals.
The sulphur bottom— or blue whale, as
It is better called by the Norwegians-
Is not only tho largest living animal,
but the -largest that has ever lived,
reaching a length of eighty feet or
very rarely a little more. Whales grow
much larger than this In books and
newspapers, but In actual life not one
In a dozen even of this species attains
a length of eighty feet. The popular
hlea of a whalo is that It Is a clumsy
animal, but, as shown by models, It
bas the graceful lines of a yacht. Tho
total weight of i\ whale Is about sixty
tuns, and unusually large and fat indi
viduals must reach at least sixty-five
tons. The largest animal of the past
bo far discovered Is tho great Dinosaur
brontosaurufi, and this big reptile
weighed about thirty-eight tons.—Mu

DEEP SEA FISHING.
Quite as Much a Game of Chance at
Politics or Poker.
You let down a heavy lump of lead
and two big hooks baited with clams
Into thirty, forty or sixty feet of wa
ter. Then you wait until something
nudges the line or until you suspect
that the hooks are bare.
Then you give tbe line a quick jerk
aud pull in hand over hand, with more
or less resistance, and see what you
have drawn Into tbe grab bag.
It may be a silly but nutritious cod,
gaping ln surprise at this curious ter
mination of his Involuntary rise in tho
world, or a silvery haddock, staring at
you with round, reproachful eyes, or
a pollock, handsome, but worthless, or
a shiny, writhing dogfish, whose vil
lainy is written on every line of his
degenerate, chlnless face.
It may be that spiny gargoyle of the
sea, a sculpln, or a soft and stupid bake
from the mud flats. It may be any
one of the grotesque products of Nep
tune's vegetable garden, a sea cucum
ber, a sea carrot or a sea cabbage, or
It may be nothing at all.
When you have made your grab and
deposited tho result. If it be. edible, ln
the barrel which stands in tho middle
of tho boat, you try another grab, and
that's the whole story.
It is astonishing how much amuse
ment apparently sane men get out of
such a simple game as this. The in
terest lies, first, in the united effort to
fill the barrel, and, second, in the ri
valry among the fishermen as to which
of them shall take in the largest cod
or the greatest number of haddock,
these being regarded as prize packages.
The sculpln and the sea vegetables
may be compared to comic valentines,
which expose the recipient to ridicule.
The dogfish are like tax notices and
assessments— the man who gets one of
them gets less than nothing, for they
count against the catcher. It is quite
as much a game of chance as politics
or poker. You do not know on which
sldo of the boat the good fish are hid
den.
You cannot tell the difference be
tween the nibble of a cod and the bite
of a dogfish. You have no idea of
what is coming to you until you have
hauled in almost all of your line and
caught sight of your allotment wrig
gling and whirling in the blue water.
Sometimes you get twins.— Serluuer's.
Good Actions.
When we have , practiced good ac
tions awhile they become easy. When
they are easy we take pleasure Iv
them. When they please us wo do
them frequently, and then by frequen
cy of act they grow Into a habit.—Tll

PLYMOUTH.
Jan.' 2B.- Scientists hold that de
nuding liiml ot timber is detrimental
to the land and the surrounding
country by drying up of the springs
and the moisture generally. We have
a case in huud that disposes of this
theoiy entirely, whether it will; do
for v criterion to go by we are not
not saying, but it is a fuot, that we
know of a piece of laud, throe or four
hundred ucres, thut was heavily tim
bered fifty years ugo, that has been
eutirely denuded of everything, the
milling timber hao been made Into
lumber and tho small timber and
iJtAJJiW LEDfirKßf JACKSON. CALTFOKuNIA,
underbrush have been cleared ' off ao
ns to make It available for pasture
aud raising grain and hay. And now
in the hottest and dryest part of the
year there Is five or six times nfl
much water running from tho springs
as there was befote it wns cleared off.
This wo know to be a fact, and we
can substantiate the same by living
witnesses. Perhaps it has never been
suggested to the scicntilln gentlemen
that perhaps that from ten to fifty,
and nometimes one hundred large
trees and n great many small ones on
an ncre of land would .absorb more
moisture than the sun would after
the land was cleared off. At all
events in this oase the verdict is
against the timber, and we think
investigation of all similar cases will
show similar results.
Old and Mrs Pub. have been sick
all th« year with the exoeption of one
day. We were tiikoti sick on the
second day of the year, and have held
our own pretty well up to date". We

turns op we will pull through this
time.

Lo,' baa ever seen so mild a winter as
the present. The warm weather and
the warm rains of December and
January bave pushed along the feed
beyond all conception, and conse
quently prevented several . thousand
head of stouk from dying from
hunger and put millions of money
in the pockets of the stookraisers.
As we have said before, the summer
fallow was' short. So has been tho
winter fallow, and 1 fear that tbere
will be a short acreage unless we
get a long spell of good weather in
February.
The Ledger seems to think that the
wild geese have a notion that the
spring is about to open up. If those
wild geese go back to their summer
resort this time of year, 1 will bet
that they will get fooled a little bit.

Kobert 1. Davis, son of Mr and Mrs

Monday last, of consumption. He
had been afflicted . for the paat ! two
years. His fatal illness is believed
to have started from an injury re
ceived while playing baseball j about
two years ago. He was struck in the
back, aud while to all outward ap
pearance the injury healed up, it is
supposed that the injury was ,q6ru
mmiicatod to the lung. He Was
never a well man afterward. ' Decoas
ed was the youngest of a large family,
consisting of six sons and one daugh
ter, and was the first to be stricken
by the hand of death. Ho was born
in Shenandoah valley, and was a
member of Forest parlor N. S. U. W.
The funeral was held on Wednesday,
tho remains being interred in the
Plymouth cemetery.

Army of Unemployed.
"I ho stato of tbe local labor mnrket
today is in striking contrast to tbe
oondltion of affairs that prevailed six
months ago, or up to tbe time of tbo
recent financial stringency. Then it
was difficult to hire any one to do
any 'kind of manual labor, on account
of the scarcity of mon, or rather of
the superabundance of work for them.
But with tbe panla everything has
taken a tumble. Now mon are travel
ing over tbe country on the lookout
for work. Men are chasing for jobs,
Instead of jobs hunting men. Not tor
many years have there been so many
tramps traveling through Amador,
many of them packing their blankets,
seeking employment, as nijt.ho present
time. Some of the mines around this
city report from twenty to twenty-five
applicants per day. On the ranches
the same thiiiK prevails. During the
summer it <vns next to impossiblo to
get woodeboppers. There was no lack
of wood, but tho schedule demanded
by the woodohoppers was deemed
absolutely prohibitory. Hence the
scarcity of store and cord wood in
these parts. . Now the farmers can
get all the choppers they want at
reasonable rates.
It is true that some of tbe appli
cants are irrevocably wedded to the
tramp fruternity. The wandering,
listless spirit has captured them so
tbat they are powerless to overcome
it. This habit grows on a man just
tbe same as the drink or drug habit,
holding its victim relentlessly within
its grasp. This was exemplified a few
days ago on a farm a few miles from
Jackson. A stranger was given a job
at cutting wood. He was informed
he could have employment all winter.
After working a few days he wanted
to draw a few dollars on account to
buy clothes. The amount asked was
given him. tie went off, and stayed
away several days. When he return
ed be was still without tbe new tog
gery, that he went to buy. But he
set to work again, and was given
another chance. . In a short time be
again applied « for money, saying that
be never did work in one place for
more than a month at a time any
way, no matter how good a job be
might have. So off be went to gratify
his irresistible wandering appetite.

Dies at.llic Sanitarium.
. Louis IVrliiniln, who for an number
of years has kept the Perianda saloon
in the Kftuguiuetti block, died last
Monday at the Sierra flanitatlum.
While ho bnd been a sufferer from
miners' consumption for ninny years,
the close of life came rather sudden
and uufixpeoted. He bad a room at
the Exchange lodging house kept by
John Chirm, where he lms roomed tor
a long time. On Wednesday of last
week he complained of pains [across
the back nud was so bad tbat be was
confined to his bed. He was uißed to
send for a doctor, but wns disinclined
to do en. After being bedridden for
two days, he seemed to be getting
worse, and a medical man waß sum
moned. This was on Friday morn ing,
nnd the physiolan saw at once that
ho was in a very critical condition.
He was removed tho same morning
to tbe sanitarium near Martells,
where he might get careful nursing
by trained attendants. It was a
hopeless case, as the lungs were in
such a HHdMip hardenod condition
from that insidious disease, miners'
consumption, tbat the end was sim
ply a question of a few hours.
He was held in higb esteem by his
Austrian countrymen, and when it
became known that he was dangerous
ly ill visitors flocked out to the
sanitarium in great numbers on Sun
day to inquire about bis condition,
for of course they were not permitted
to enter the sick chamber, lie was
conscious up to within a short time
of the end, and passed away early
Monday morning.
The body was brought to his sister's
residence in Jackson the same
day. Deceased was a native ot
Austria, aged about 49 years. He
leaves a brother and a married sister,
both residents of Jaokson.
For the greater part of his life de
ceased had been a great sufferer.
When a young man be worked in one
of the mines around here, the Zeila
we believe. While so employed he
met with an accident, sustaining a
fracture of the leg. This was about
'J5 years ago. The limb failed to
reunite properly, and caused him a
great deal of pain through life.
Years afterwards he had it rebrok'en
and reset. Some years thereafter he
was a victim of a capsize, m which
be again sustained an injury of the
lame leg. About two years ago he
entered the German hospital in San
l'rnncisco. where tbe limb was
amputated at tbe thigh. He was a
universal favorite on account of bis
genial ways, patient endurance of
suffering, and strict integrity of char
acter. ' "! ' ' . '
The funeral took place Wednesday
afternoon, from tbe residence of his
brother-in-law, John Baun on Center
street. The obsequies were conduct
ed under tbe auspices of Kathbone
Lodge K. of P., of Jackson, of which
lodge the deceased had long be.en an
honored member. Interment was in
tho Protestant oemetery. His brother
members of tbe Kuighta of .Pythias
turned out in a body, as well as a
long procession of private citizens, to
•>ay the last silent tribute of respect
for the departed. Key. T. H. Nioh
olas of tbe M. E. church conducted
the services.

McGee Returns
From Eastern Trip.
- Wm. J. McGee, who has just return
ed from New York, cays the financial
conditions in the East are greatly
improved; that tbe banks have begun
to make loans again. It ia generally
thought tbe worst Is over, but it may
be many months before the country
gets over the effects of tbe recent
crisis. Mr McCjoo returned via
Washington and New Orleans. Mrs
McUee remained in Boston for a visit
with her mother and her daughter,
who is studying music in the Boston
conservatory.
Mr McUee was asked after being
J'inst and seeing conditions, what he
thought caused the money scare. He
banded us a clipping wliich he eaid
was a portion of secretary I'att's
speech recently delivered in Boston,
and which he thought was the best
reason that bad yet been given for
the panic. Tbe clipping is as fol
lows:
"The world generally has. a certain
amount of loanable capital available
for new, enterprises or the enlarge
ment of old ones. In poriorls of pros
perity, this capital with the instru
mentalities for enlarging it potential
ly by credits is put iuto new enter
prises which are profitable, abd the
increase in free capital, goes on
almost in arithmetical progression.
After a time, however, expenses ot
operation and wages increase and tho
profit from the new enterprises grows
smaller. Tbe loanable capital gradu
ally changes its form into investments
less and less convertible. Muoh of
that which might be capital is wasted
in nnwise euterprioee, iv extravagance
in liviug, iv wars and absolute de
struction of property, until the avail
able free capital becomes well-nigh
exhausted the world over, and the
progress of new enterprises must
await the savings of more. Men cou
ninuo to embark iv new enterprises,
however, the capital tails them, and
disaster comes.
"For eight or nine months last past
there were many indications that the
loanable capital of the world was noar
exhaustion. This result was brought
abnut not only by the enormous
expansion of business plants and
business investment, which could not
bo readily contorted, but also by the
waste of capital in extravagance of
living aud by the Spanish War, tho
Boor War, mid the liusbian-Japanete
\Vnr, and in such catastrophes bs
Ualtimoie aud San Francisco, ft be
comes impossible for the soundest
railroads and other enterprises to
borrow money for new construction
or ieoon6truotioii. Tho condition
was not confined to this country, but
extended the world over, and was
mttdo manifest iv tho countries ot
Kurope even before it was felt here.
"Secondly, tho conclusion can not
be avoided that the revelations of
irregularity, breaotios of trust, etock
jobbing, overissue of stock, violations
of luw, and lack of rigid state aud
national supervision in the manago
niout of eoiue of our largest iusurauco
companies, railroad oompanies, trac
tion companies, aud financial cor
porations, shocked mvebtors uud
rnude them withhold what little loan
able capital remained available.
Such disolosurea had much more
effect, probably, abroad than they
had here, because bore we were able
to make distinctions, while there, at a
remote distance, tbe revelations creat
ed distrust in our whole business
tubric.
"When therefore two or threo in
stitutions, banks, and trust companies
supposed to be solid were found to
have their capital impaired by stock
jobbing of their officers, the public
where easily frighteued and tbe run
upon buuka began."

Why Ho Mover Married.
A matinee girl from Chicago looked
up from a long aud painful study of
one of Clyde Fitch's autographed sen
timents into that author's face.
"Mr. Fitch," she began mournfully,
"I know why you have not married."
"Tell me. I would like to know."
"Certainly. It must have happened
this way: You wrote a proposal of
marriage to a beautiful leading wo
man in one of your companies. You
should have proposed in person. But
you wrote. She couldn't read your
writing and thought It was a dismiss
al from the company. She drowned
herself, and you are still unmarried."
The dramatic author thoughtfully
rolled a cigarette.
"It is as good a reason as I know,"
he ( responded.— Flttsburg Dispatch.

removed the furniture from the dluing
room, leaned two , ladders against tho
hall mantel and stacked a half dozen
variegated cans of paint on the side
board it means he is now ready to
paint the outside shutters and the back

MACBETH.
A Fimout Actor 1 o View, on th« Sl«ep-
walkinri Soena.
Tho first llmo I rend (his tragedy 1
expected to sco the sleepwalking scene
plnyed by Macbeth Instead of his wlfo.
This srene occurs at the beginning of
tho fifth net, and not until tho gentle
woman and the doctor converse togeth
er aro wo nwnre of the change In Lady
Macbeth's charnclor nnd of the Illness
that hns made her. weak. A woman
so brutal in her conception nnd no res
olute in her projects— how could she at
once lose steadfastness, she who was
capable of saying:
I would, while It was smiling In my face,
llavo plucked my nipple from hit bono
loa.i Rums
And dashed the brains out.
Such a woman Is capable of commit
ting any crime without losing her^ lm
passlyeneKS. I should have preferred
not to see her, even In sleep, wash bet
hands of tho murder of Duncan. Her
wicked personality would have appear
ed fitill greater.
I do not believe that Shnkespeare
meant the sleepwalking scene for Lady
Macbeth. Have you not noticed how
preclso the famous writer was In draw
lug his characters? He 'always tried
to keep them In tho same light from
beginning to end. To my mind it seems
Impossible that Lady Macbeth should
collapse like that. Instead it would
bo more natural In Macbeth. I found
this scene so unnatural that I cut It
out In my version. .
The explanation may be something
like this: 111 Shakespeare's day there
were no women plnyers. Perhaps some
of tho actors were not satislied with
the length of their respective parts.
Shakespeare, to keep the peace, may
have- shortened Mncbeth's speeches and
given them to Homebody else.
The tragedy of Macbeth is v sublime
display of tragic passion, a pathetic
picture of fate and evil conquering
good. There is no moral, but without
doubt this play may be regarded as
tho greatest work of dramatic litera
ture.— Tommaso Salvini in Putnam's
Monthly.
ENGLISH GHOST STORY.
A Vision That Saved a Life on the
Yorkshire Dales.
It is not often that we hear of a
ghost saving a man's life. There is,
however, an instance, and it seems to
bo tolerably well authenticated, and
materialists will hardly know how to
account for it. Here is the story. It
Is of tbe Yorkshire dales and of a good
many years ago. A clergyman whose
duty lay in that wild country, where
a strong race of men and women lived
principally on bacon and oatcake and
knew not save rarely butcher's meat,
used to ride or walk to rislt the people.
lie had been raising a subscription in
a time of scarcity and had to be out
late at night. One evening on his out
ward journey he suddenly became
aware of a figure moving beside him,
and in the gloaming he recognized his
brother, who had died some time be
fore. He was too awestruck for
words, and after keeping by his side
for some distance over the lonely moor
the figure disappeared. He noted the
time and the vision, but nothing oc
curred to throw any light upon it.
However, some years after he had
taken tho duty at a jail in another part
of the country one of the prisoners ly
ing under sentence desired to make a
confession. After telling him of a lot
of crimes he said: "I wor very near
once taking your life, sir. It was In
that bad year, and I heerd as how yon
went carrying money about in those
lonesome dales. I hid behind tbe big
bowlders of tbe brown moor. I saw
you coming 1 up and waited till you
should be near euougb, but that night
you were not alone." This is a star
tling tale and the stronger because
the vision or whatever it was was seen
by two people. The anecdote occurs iv
an article twenty years ago in Mac
millan's Magazine by Lady Verney.
Sense of Smoll.
The olfactory nerves are wonderfully
sensitive. Much has yet to be investi
gated with regard to the differentia
tion of the points in those nerves so
that they may discriminate with such
apparently miraculous accuracy, yet
even tin; results In the scent of dogs
show how wonderfully fine is their
discriminating power. Our sense of
smell, unless in tbe trained chemist, is
not even so acute as that of the semi
savage. Much have we gained by civi
lization, but not without some loss to
our bodily energies and senses. Man's
recuperative ixmer after an injury is
said frequently to be Iv inverse ratio
to his social advancement. Similarly
he seems to become less acute and del
lcato in tho sense of smell as he fares
better and lives more comfortably.— St
Louis Republic.
Houses and Hornet.
There have been and there aro teday
In tbe various lauds of the earth many
people who hare no houses and noth
ing that you could call furniture eveu
of the antiques variety. Dut there can
bo no doubt that they are far happier
than many who are comfortably housed
in mansions which contain everything
that money can buy.— Uncle Remus'
Magazine.
Talking and Thinking.
The Man — A learned scientist ad
vances the theory that a severed bead
la capable of thinking, although It Is
unable to speak. Tbe Woman— That's
queer. It Is so much easier to talk
than It Is to think!
Call Money.
Nell — What 1b call money, dearT
B«U«— I gueM it's tbe kind you call op
/oar husband on the telephone for to
tell blm you mast bare it right away.

Jiy bin ingenious system of con
trolling distant eleotrio signals by
sound, John Gardner, KiirMsli elec
trioian, claims to make mi automobile
torpedo respond like a don to h cnll,
to llro a niitio, blow a steamer's
whistle, or give useful Blgunls on an
eleotrio bell or printing telegraph.
The sounds— preferably transmitted
through water— must fanve a constnnt
musical pltoh, duration and interval,
though several simultaneous sounds
of differing pitch maybe necessary to
act in soino cases. The sounds ore
reooived by a vibrator of steel tape,
on which is mounted a enrbou-penoil
microphone, whioh remains stationary
with silence or an unsuitable note
but amplifies a note for which the
vibrator 13 tuned, and this diminishes
the contact between vibrator and
microphone, lessening the current
through a relay and thus causing a
tongue to drop and close a local cir
cuit, which effects the action desired.
Several distinct operations may be
controlled. In a small model, a pro
peller has been started, a rudder set
as desired, and an explosive charge
tired, all by the voice at a distance of
gome yarda in a tone a little above a
whisper. A powerful sound generator
will give action over several miles.
The new library proposed in Krimcn
by K. (inldaohmifit and Paul Otlet is
to hare mioroscopio print on psmoi of
reduced civ.6, and the books are to be
read by a special magnifying appar
atus. A uniform international stand
ard of size is suggested. The cost of
the small books would be not more
than a si.xtli of that of the present
large ones, library work would be
lessened, and capacity increased. •
In a new French Welsbaah muntle,
the rare oxidos are consolidated in an
eleotrio furnace, greatly increasing
resistance to shocks, 1 tremors and
draughts. ,
"Oedipiaru" is the name given to
the act of tonriup out one's eyes.
Dr. Ch. Lalon, a French physiaian,
reports the recent case of a merchant,
made insane by losses,' who attempted
euicido by dashing his bead against a
wall and tried torupturo his eyo-bnlls
by pressing his thumbs against them.
The globes were not ruptured, though
blindness eventually resulted. About
twenty similar cases are found to be
on rocord, aud in overy instance the
patient— always insane— has tried to
tear out both eyes. Kvery degree of
injury has boen inflicted. Eminent
physicians have doubted that the eyes
could be torn out by tho fingers
alone, but recont facts have proven
that tho muscles and tough * optic
nerve have been torn aud scratched
through by the nails and the ovidence
is conclusive that the eye-balls have
beeu completely, romoved in some
oases. The self-mutilators are all
melancholies, usually with religious
delusions, self-destruction being the
end in view. Temporary injury is
inflicted by designing sane persons,
aud malingerors— such as working
men seeking special compensation
aud soldiers wishing to secure dis
charge— someitmes mutilate the eye
by introducing tobacco or other
irritating Euhstnncos.
Tho novel household freezing ma
chine described by Consul K. J.
Thompson from Hanover has a capac
ity of five gallons or more, and is a
double-walled vessel of tin with a
hollow space an iucli'deep completoly
surrounding the iuDer compartment.
Carbonic acid from ordinary storago
under pressure is admitted to the
bottom of this surrounding chamber
passing through a cross-armed tube
into tho top of tho inner vessel.
Ibe sudden expansion of tbe car
bonic add yields great cold, and
wntcr is ohauged to ice in sixty
seconds, whilo meats, fruits,' bottled
beverages, etc., may be chilled ,or
frozen iv a few seconds.
Tho thousands of sandhill nests of
the "magnetic" aut or Northern
Australia— lately inspected by tbe
governor general— measure '2 to 3 by
10 to 15 feet. They form a "nature's

always irjrth and south.
In the transformation of uranium

radioactive substances in unture, have

The idea of using houso refuse for
iuel, hh_ is being so successfully
ntlt'inplod in tho refuse-burning
plants of lmgo cities, is applied on n
small scnlo in the new fuel- called
"coalesoine"— of an English borongb
engineer. Uartißge, bits of unburned
coal from tbe fishes, and other waste,
aro pulverized, mixed with tnr, and
made into briquettos. This fuel Is

Typhoid is now known to spring
from a variety of sources, nnd Dr.
Seatou, a British health officer,
doubts whether ten por cent of cases
can bo attributed to infected drinking
water. Polluted food seems to bo a
common cnuso, and cases of doubtful
origin have suggested that other
germs besides the so-called typhoid
bacilli may produce the disease.

EXPECTED TOO MUCH.
Th« Hotel Clerk Thought the Guest
Got Hi* Moneys Worth.
"A friend of mine hns gnined con
■ldombie notoriety Among ti»o boys,"
said n drummer, "on neeount of his nn
tlpathy for ninny of tho iuhnhltnnts
to be found in tho hotels of mnny of
the small country towns. Mnny n time
he has born known to leave his bed In
the middle of the night to sonrch for
moro comfortable nnd Agreeable <\\uw
ters. Kecontly ho landed nt n small
town. 1 happened to bo there tlmt
night, nnd when I Wiw him enter I
lintnedintely scontod trouble. Thnt
place wns known for the droves of
rats which swnnned nbout the prem

friend abhorred It was a int. Well, he
Rot his room. I wna sitting In the lob

had retired when suddenly I wns ntnr
tled by v sudden racket on the upper

clerk, ho expostulated excitedly ngnlnst
the rats.
" 'They rnu nil over the bed nnd nil
over the floor. Finally I tried to shoo
them out. I turned on the light, nud
there were two big ones in the center
of the floor fighting like tigers.'
" 'Well, whnt do you want for 50
cents,' calmly asked the clerk, 'a bull

THE PIANO'S SOUL.
It Is Imparted to the Instrument by
tho "Scale."
"Every piano factory," said a piano
manufacturer, "employs what wo pi
ano men call a 'scale.' It would be too
long for me to explain to you all about
it, but In piano making the 'scale' is
the man who after all else has been
done Imparts to the piano its soul.
"I canuot tell you how they do it.
They do not know themselves, and no
man can tench another. It is born, like
all art. The 'scales' are very few and
hard to get, and we pay them hand
some wages. But they are ns difficult
to manage ns tho great tenors of grand
opera and as sensitive as women. Like
all artists, they are forever squabbling
among themselves about little things,
and, as you may guess, jealousy Is
their besetting evil.
"But I have not yet explained what
the 'scale' does. When a piano Is all
strung nnd tuned nnd ready to leave
the factory, the 'scale' sits down to It
all alone and screws it to pitch. His
ear is so true, his hand so fine and his
sense of the reasons for sound is so
delicate and exquisite that when he
has finished his work that which was
a mere box containing strings has be
come a voice thnt can sing if you know
how to make It sing. The 'scale' has
given it a soul— a part of his own
soul."— New York World.
Didn't Please the Critic.
When Verdi wns putting the last
touches to "II Trovatore" he was vis
ited in his study by a privileged friend.
The friend was one of the ablest living
musicians nnd critics. He wns permit
ted to look nt tho score iind run over
the "duvil chorus" on the pianoforte.
"What do you think of that?" asked
the master. "Trash!" said the con
noisseur. Verdi rubbed ills hands and
chuckled, "Now, look nt this and this,"
he said. "Rubbish!" said tho other,
rolling a cigarette. The composer rdse
and embraced him with a burst of JOS-.
"What do you moan?" asked the critic.
"My dear friend," cried Verdi, "I have
beeu ma!: ing a popular opera. In it I
resolved to please everybody except
the purists, the groat judges, the clns
felcists, like you. Had I pleased you I
should have- pleased 110 one else. What
you say assures me of success. In
three months 'II Trovatore' will be
sung and roared and whistled and bar
rel orgaued all over Italy."—Philadel
phia Inquirer.
Tha American Author.
Tho chief thing in the average Amer
ican novel is the amazing vitality of
the author. He writes always at the
top of his voice, His strenuousness is
unceasing. The reader can almost see
the swollen veins on his forehead, the
tight drawn mouth and flashing eye.
It Is do It or die. And he never knows
•where to stop. With his feverish anx
iety to make points he does not seem
to realize when he has achieved his
purpose and frequently fizzles out in
effectively. He has ideas. lie has
vast quantities of material. He has a
command of language, a fatal fluency
that frequently leads to his downfall,
for he lacks a sense of values. He
lacks self restraint. He Is full of
tricks and artfulness, but, he Is not an
artist— London Saturday Review.

LOCAL EDITORIAL NEWS.
EXCELLENT BANK SHOWING.
The first annu.il report of the Bank of Amador county
since it passed into the hands of its present management
was laid before the board of directors at a meeting held this
week, and a semi-official statement thereof will be found else
where in these columns. The showing is an unusually flat
tering one. It may be safely stated that few batiks in the
state can, in these limes of monetary tightness, present a
more satisfactory balance sheet. It indicates a conservative
management that must t tend to give business men and de
positors generally increasing confidence in the local institu
tion. During the present period of depression the experi
ence of nearly all the banks, not only in California but
throughout the country, has been a serious shrinkage of
resources in the shape of deposits. This has been the case
with a large majority of the soundest banks iv the country.
Money in vast sums has left the banks and gone into hiding,
until the crazy spell of distrust has passed away. But the
Bank of Amador county seems to have experienced no such
thing. Its resources in capital stock and deposits are over
half a million — far iv excess of any previous period in its his
tory. Its cash on hand is over $180,000, or over forty per
cent of the total due depositors. And the year has been
one of unpreceudented prosperity for the stockholders, the
surplus and profits footing up over one and a quarter times
the amount of the capital stock.
It is pleasing, in these days of impaired confidence, to be
ble to point to the exceptionally strong position held by our
banking institution. We do this freely and voluntarily, as a
matter of justice to a well-conducted bank, in which we have
no interest whatever other than a small depositor. A bank
run along conservative and uafe lines is a tower of strength
in any community, and such the Bank of Amador county
unquestionably is, as is^showu by its^ annual statement. <
THE DISINCORPORATION MOVEMENT.
The petition for the disincorporation of Jackson has been
industioasly circulated during the past week. It now con
tains within two or three names of a clear majority of all the
votes cast at the last city election, when the votes polled for
the opposing candidates for , city clerk aggregated 237. No
doubt the full number of signatures, with a safe margin to
spare, will be secured in time to lay the petition before the
city trustees for action thereon at their regular meeting next
Thursday.  :; '-: ■ " :
Some persons seem to be laboring under a wrong impres
sion as to the main purpose of this movement. They regard
it as ainfed at dispensing with local self-government alto
gether. But this is not the main object sought to be at
tained. While we are free to say that if the sample of gov
ernment we have been treated for the past two years is the
best that we are capable of, then it were better to revert back
permantly to our former status. But we have a higher
opinion of the capacity of this people than to entertain such
a thought. Personally we believe under efficient manage
ment Jackson could be made a city of which all residents
might be proud. But- the little experience 'we. have gained
proves that this is hopeless under existing conditions, even
with the best possibje... management. We have a clash of in
terests that can never be overcome, and must everbea thorn in
the path of municipal progress. We have started wrong,
we have more territory than we can citify, or properly handle.
Our revenue is dissipated over such a wide area that no sec
tion is satisfied. The only way to get in shape to do some
thing worth doing is to disincorporate, and start afresh when
the time limit has elapsed, if "we then feel like so doing. This
is our position. The Ledger is advocating no backward i>tep
If disincorporated, we would vote for and advocate reincor.
poration to-morrow within manageable limits.

Matrimonial Boom. \k
The little Orthodox Greek church
on tbe Jackson. Gate road was th«>
sceno of a marriage boom yesterduy
morning such as has never before
been witnessed in this county. A
priest of the orthodox faith, Key. T.
N. Fosbkovsky, made a special trip
from SarT Francisco to gratify the
trinity of couples that were anxious to
be united in wedlock. . Three brides
and grooms were in church at the
same time to get married, in this
unexampled muster tbe Greek church
is entitled to tbe premium.
'ihe church was well filled by the
fiiends of the contracting parties,
and a number who were not of that
religions faith, who gathered out of
curiosity to witness the trio of wedd-
The first couple to the altar were
Viado Bentenlob of San Kraooisoo and
Miss Drago Kadonovich of Jackson.
The bride's attendant was Mrs (Jinvi
nioh. Unlike the -practice in otber
churches, it seems to; be the rule
with the Orthodox church that the
iiride shall be attended by a married
lady. after the cere
mony this couple left the church and
were driven in a carriage to lone,
where they took the train for San
Francisoo, where they intend to make
their home,' tbe groom being engaged
in business in the city.
Tbe second couple to be wedded
were UolubKavaoevicband Miss Uoke
Savtcb, the bridesmaid being Mrs
Ferovioh. They also left the church
aa soon as tbe marriage ceremony was
over.
The laut couple were Mackin Choro
vicb and Miss Stanor Dabovich, tbe
latter being attended by Mrs Lepe
tiob. The two last named couples
will make their homes in this city.

Electoral College Figures.
The time Is at hand tor cutting out
of tbe lipwspnpcra tables of the eleo
toral rote of 190H, mid beginning to
elect presidents by tbe fascinating
process of making combinations of
the states that are deemed to be favor
ably inclined to the different candi
dates. Tbe new electoral oollege will
include forty-six states, with a total
of ■1H:1 votes, making 2112 necessary to
a choice. The college will vote as
follows:
Alabama • • 11 Nebraska • - 8
Arkansas - S) Nevada. • 3
California • 10 New Hampshire 4
Colorado • 5 New Jersey - '12
Connecticut • 7 New York - H9

A simple way to figure ou the pro
boble result is to take the "Solid
South" as the basis of the democratic
strength, and add to it the states
that Mr iiryan may be able to carry
under dillerent contingencies. Giv
ing Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland,
Delaware and Oklahoma to the Solid
South, the democracy counts .on lU9
votes in that region. It will be
necessary for Mr Bryan to secure
sevonty-thiee more' in the North.
