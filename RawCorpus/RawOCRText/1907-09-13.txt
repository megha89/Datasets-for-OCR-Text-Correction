Available.— Potato Pencils.
la a nore! electroplating process
lately developed in France, tbe
solution — which may be any of the
usual plating baths— is contained in a
biush, wbicb ia connected to the posi
tive pole of the electric circuit while
tbe object to bo plated ia connected
to the negative 'pole, and simply
brushing the well-cleaned object
gives a regular and adherent deposit.
The thicKnesa ot the layer formed de
pends on th 9 duration of the brushing
and tbe number of applications to
eaun spot. Larger objects than usnal
can be covered, and a durface may be
plated with several different metals,
thus giving a varied decoration.
Our physical education consists in
exercising the muscles, and A. Peres
a Freuoh physiologist, points out that
our senses receive only the training
that codes through general education,
while tasts and smell are quite
neglected. A ueiv gymnastic is need
ed, with special training of each
aense. The acutenesa arising from
the exercise of a single sense is otteu
seeu, aud a systematic effort tj
develop the powers of all will cause
tiie pupils to observe, listen, feel and
sniff instead of passively seeing, hear
ing, touching and smelling. The
ott'ect ot the attention and anaugiug
the organs in certain ways is to give
impressions greater intensity, accur
acy and serviceableness.

averting premature old age. In the
apparatus of Dr. Moutier. the patient
is seated within a spiral ooil of wire
charged by an alternating current of
40,0110 or 50,000 volts with a frequency
of 500,000 or 000,000 alternations per
second, and a tew sittings of five
minutes each have reduced the
arterial pressure, as shown by tbe
spbygmometer, from 10 inches of
mercury to tbe normal (5 inches, tbe
cine beiug permanent and the harden
ing of the arteries effectively arrested.
L'be rapidity of actisn is found to
vary cniefiy with the digestion— not
<vitb the patient's age. Dr. Aloutier
has successfully treated abnormally
low arterial pressure by means of the
electric spray or effluvium, a charged
metallic comb forming one electrode
being moved up and down near tbe
spiue while tbe patient— on an in
sulated stool— grasps the other elec
trode. In a third form of appli
cation, relief is given to gouty and
tbeumatic patients by high frequency
currents conveyed directly to tho
body through cunductots grasped by
tbe bauds.
A singular forest of stone columns
at Dikilatcb, iv Havaria, has beeu
visited by Frof. De Launay, a fc'reneh
geographer, who reports tbat thi=
ruiu-like formation extends over a
anace about 1500 feet long l>y 100 to
150 feet bioad on tbe edge ot a
plateau in tbe open country, tbe
columns being 15 to 20 feet high and
-c.Die ot them a yaid thick, their
shape being absolutely cylindrical.
They have been produced by erosion
of masses of .the gray nummulitic
limestone broken by jointing. A
special study was made by Prof. De
Lauuay. aud hQ concludes tbat whirls
iv tbe bed of a torrent gave tbe
columns their isolation and shape.
After a special study ot tbe thermal

Hyla resiniUctrix— lately described
by Dr. Kinil A. Uoeldi, director o
tlie Para Museum. This creature —
which is marked with bands ot green
isb-yellow, brown and white, with
conspicuous spots— makes its horn
in the tall forest trees along tb
Amazon, where it appropriates a
cavity or a hollow in some lofty
branch, and proceeds to adapt it to
the required purpose by making it
water-tight. The porous wood is
lined with a coating of anromatic
pitch, which is slowly collected aa
it drips from the bark of resinous j
tree. Kains form a permanent pool
in this tree-top basin, aud here the
iron lays its eggs, the tadpoles hutch
and swim about, then become trans
formed into perfect young tree-frogs,
which in turn seek suitable places foi
establishing their own little lakelets.

Land and Mineral Decisions.
Mineral— Land more valuable on
account of tbe sandstono therein thau
for argiculture cannot be entered
under tho homestead law.
Claim— A iudgment favor
able to the applicant in judicial pro
ceedings instituted by an adveise
claimant is no bar to a subsequeut
investigation on behalf of the govern
meut to determine whether said ap
plicant ha 3in fact complied with the
law. A deed iv escrow to land em
braced iv a mineral application, not
delivered uutil after entry, does not
defeat the right of the applicaut to
make entry of suoh land.
Patent— Patent for all of a fraction
al section conveys only such land as
may be then included within tbe ap
proved township plat of survey,
failure to desoribe iv a patent tbe
lands actually purchased will not
leave ihe lands so omitted subject to
the entry of another.
Ke3ervatiou of Land — No specific
authority exists empowering tlie
president to reserve public land; but
tbe right to reserve suoh lands, for
public uses is recognized and main
tained by the courts.
'lbe powei of the president to oreate
a reservation extends to any unappro
priated public land.
Settlement— Actual date of settle
ment may be shown on contest, or on
final proof, though it be earlier than
alleged iv the application. Priority
of settlement confers uo right where
it is not made for the ; purposes con
templated by law.
Settlement— Priority of, is piotect
eii oniy uijult legal assertion oi
rigtb. Kigbts claimed under settle
ment should be asserted within tbe
statutory period to be effective as
against tbe intervening entry ot
another.
Stare Decisis— The doctrine of Stare
Decisis is recognized and followed in
tbe department iv cases tbat involve
principles well established by a uni
form line of decisions.
Survey Marks— The law providss a
penalty for tbe destruction of survey
marks. A section ot land is not sur
veyed.uutil every line of the section
has been actually run aud the corners
established.
Timber aud Stone— An applicaut for
the right of timber land purchase
must show that the laud applied for
is free from adverse occupancy and
tbat be has made no other application
to purchase under the timber act.
Until au application is finally allow
ed the applicant has no right to or
control over the land.
Timber Cutting— The owner of a
mining claim in the Colville Indiau
Keservatiou, Washington, has the
same right to use and remove timber
upon bis claim as tbe owner of a
miuiug claim elsewbere.

Scarcity of School-teachers.
The Urst of September has come
and gone, and the school teacher is
abroad in the land in her infinite var
iety. lam one of those happy or un
happy people upon wbom the honor
ot beiug a school trustee has been
trust at various times during the last
decade.
Ten years ago it was a comparative
ly easy matter to select a teacber to
the immediate satisfaction of all par
ties interested. There was au
abundance of material from which to
pick and choose. We are ultra
critical. Hard to please. We may
be just as critical to-day, jnst as
hard to please, but we ao not dare to
say so. We are humble. We bold
out inducements in the way of pleas
ant boarding places, various amuse
ments, good looking, energetic young
men, who own fast horses, yet withal,
>ye are fortunate to get even one
application. More often, we are the
seekers. Of course there are reasons.
Nursing, stenorgaphy, aud other more
agreeable pursuits, have thinned tbe
ranks of tbe teachers. Have they im
paired the quality of those entering
the field? Or has this iongsutfering
district simply a run of bad luck?
There are mauy noble, brilliant
teachers in the schools ot Amadoi
county, but there are others who seem
to think that getting a piece of parob
ment authorizing tbem to wield the
ruler, entitles them (o call a halt in
self improvement. Many of these
young girls are too bright to falter
and stagnate.
Several years ago we had a littlo
woman whose credentials seemed ail
right, yet who insisted upon using
a'int and 'baiut, but she reached tbe
limit wheu she described to a group
of visiting women how she managed a
'sby new scholar, who had started to
school that week. "He crawled un
der the seat, and 1 drug bim out."
This year we have a new one. Her
first term; yet standing on the street
the otber day iv conversation with a
friend, she asked in a loud voice,
"Was you at tho dance? 1 did not
think you was there."
Did you ever start to grate some
thing, and run Tyour Onger up aud
down the grater? it is just the feel
ing 1 expenenced wheu i realized
that once again, (forgive mo) we wore
up against it. Why don't those
bright girls tbinkr They know better
aud suoh language is hardly Bjs
tonese school-ma'ams. N. 13.
Tries to Check Reform.
The Minneapolis Messenger tries to
interrupt the work ot reform by in
iectinc Van old notion tbat reformers
should arse reform lueuicci-rcs.
Oiuvecnor Kiddle says tbat just now
it is very popular to criticise tbe
railroads and the tr-nsts. Probably
they have brougbt this upon them
selves and possibly they are not gett
ing auy more tbun is coming to them,
but it may be well, while calling
attention to tbe beam in tbe otheis'
eyes, to search for the mote tbat is in
your ownf
As foi instance:
Have you ever returned for taxa
tion all your property aud at its tiue
valuo?
Do you use a seine for fishing?
Do you shoot game out of sensouY
Do you throw garbage iv the street?
Are there weeds on your street
front more than a foot high?
Is your gasoline rmn painted red?
Do you oee an abandoned well as a
cesspool?
Uo you run your automobile faster
than fifteen miles au hour?
Do you bury dead animals, or
throw them in tbe river?
Do you pay the preacher what you
promised him, or do you oxpest your
salvation free?
Do you leave your horse untied on
tbe public street?
D» you pasture your chickens on
your neighbors' gardeus?
Do you use protaue language on
tbe public street?
When your neighbor is out of grain,
do you charge him Uve cents a bushel
more tor it at your own door than
you can get for it after hauling it to
townV
Do you put the large potatoes on
top?
Are you as careful ot rented pro
perty as it it were your own?
Did you over in> your whole life
return a borrowed book?

Do you listen with avidity to tbe

From Sandy Hook
to Liverpool
Friend fttnerson :
We boarded the Uiraard steamer,
Carmaina at her dock at 7:30 a. m.,
August 13. We hacked out of the
docket 8:33 a .m., beiug three min
utes late, which is nearer to schedule
time than most of tue trains w« left
on. After boarding, we put our hand
baggage in our stateroom, and went
on deck to sco the hurry and bustle
of parting friends. There was a large
crowd to see the ship off; but we
had said good-bye two weeks previ
ously so were spared the ceremonies.
In passing out of the sound we pass
ed the Statue of Liberty enlightening
the world; several American men of
war, the various fortifications and*
quarantine and custom house stations.
Just off Sandy iiook we stopped to
let oil the pilot and then sailed
under direction of our own captain.
The Carmanin is said to be one of
the finest and largest steamers now
afloat, but the Lusitauia and Mauritus
of the same line and soon to go into
commission are about 10,000 tonß or
50 per cent larger. The Carmauia is
(HO feet in length, Tl'j feet in width,
and 97 feet in depth. To get an idea
of ibis size just measure it otf on
Main street, I '.Link the lnngth would
reach from the National hotel to
Thomas' butcher shop. I think it
would be higher than the Globe hotel
and crowd the buildings pretty well
toward the creek on one side.
We have a four berth stateroom to
ourselves, which contains every cou
venienue, stationary "wash stand,
bureau, cloths closet, electric lights,
cail button, etc. Kauli deck has
several women and men's lavatories,
and bath rooms equal to a Urst class
hotel. Jhe diuiug ro.ims are sum
ptuous, and so far have not used auy
racks to keep disbe9 from moving,
except for the slight vibration of
engines and slight roll of the ship
jou would not know you- were on the
water. We have bieakfast at Ba. in.,
beef tea and crackers aie seived
about 11 a. in., dinner at 1:2:;1O., tea
at 5:30 p. m., aud at 8 p. m. tea or
coffee aud crackers and cheese. So
that when you are not sleeping you
can eat, aud iv between we Dare one
hour concert between 10:30 and 11:30
a. in., and 3 to i p. m.
We chose tnis line by recommend
ation of our old fellow townsman,
Chris Marelia, who procured the rail
road and tteamei tickets for us at a
considerable saving; abnut $15 less
than if we bad undertaken the job,
The meals served are excellent in
quality and variety, new bill ot fare
each meal, which is printed on board.
They have a neat little printer's shot)
with two job presses, and will send
you under separate cover samples.
There is a barbar shop, stenographer
and typewriter, also Marconi tele
graph. A daily news buget is also
published.
After dropping the pilot we were
assigned to our seats at the table aud
soon breakfast was called, by dinner
time the passengers were -getting
acquuinted, so by the next day it was
like a large family. There is a piano
in the drawing room and another in
the dining room, for those that can
sing aud play. The regular ship
band cousists of two violins, one alto,
one bass viol and one pianist, and as
that is their only employment on
board they are expeoted to play first
class music only.
The fifth day nut we got into a
heavy swell and a few missed a meal;
but although our appetite only
partially failed us for one meal, we
have missed none. Saturday evening
there was a concert for the benefit of
the sailors orphan home by volunteers
among the passengers, among them
beiug the "Kmpire Comedy A." The
saloon was crowded. A Japanese who
is in the marine engineering service
of Japau, gave a. comic recital and
Japanese songs. Lemonade and cakes
were served, and a collection taken.
There are eight to ten Californians
aboard, and quite a number of pass
engers are goiug to the Dublin ex
position. Sunday there was religious
services in the saloon, the ship crew
attending; also services among
third olasa passengers.
lbs captain inspects the ship every
day between 10 aud 11 a. in., at which
time the automatic machinery closing
the watei tight bulkheads are also
tested, ftvery omploye on duty beiug
at his post at the time of inspection.
This being an English mail line,
rules are strictly carried out. There
are ouly about 450 passenger all lold
which is a very light list, the vessel
being capable of carrying 3UUU, the
season of the year is accountable for
this.
The third class cabio passengers
having uo piauo enjoy themselves
with music of ciucertiuas, flute aud
Scotch bagpipe, and have a great time
dancing on deck, playing cross tag
and other amusements. The second
class having no dancing deck play
shuffle board and quoits. Wo have
t'oui minister, or as the sailors term
them "skypilote," yet everyone
hopes to get safely into port. Mon
day Aug. 19th. was the finest rlay
of the trip, warm or cool, port side
cool, stateroom warm, with the sea as
smooth as San Francisco bay. A trip
to the CLgine room is not as interest
ing as iv the old style eugine room,
only the three sbatts beiug visible in
parts. The turbines three of them
containing about one million blades,
ranging from 11-^l 1 -^ inches to 11 inches
in size, aro all cased nothing being
visible. Excepting the pumps the
machinery only produces a humming
sound and there is no pounding or
vibration. They certainly are a great
improvement. Everyday we met or
passed several ships, if close enough
they are signaled or communicated
with by wireless if so fitted our.
Tuesday morning Aug. 20, at 7:30
a. m., we sighted the S. W. coast of
lrejand, and sailed along tbe ooast
till dark. At 2p. m. we stopped off
Queenstown, where a smßll steamer
took otf all passengers for Ireland, to
wbom we gave a very hearty farewell
and were soon on our way under fall
speed. The "York Daily Examiner,"
was sold aboard while the transfer
ot passengers, was being made, the
lack of telegraphic news is what
struck every Amenoan. A Hre in
Brooklyn, N. V., the talegiapbers
strike, and a few other minor dis
patches made up the American newe,
among which was a report of the
bubonic plague, three cases at San
I'Vaucisoo. We steamed up the river
Mersey about daylight Wednesday
morning, and as it took about \%
hours to dock, we had breakfast and
landed at Liverpool sate and sound
about 8:30, having had what those
who crossed « number of times said a
smooth voyage, and we never missed
n meal. Thanks to having followed
the advice of Chris Marelia.
With regards to all,
Yours Waltenspiel.

THE SEA HEDGEHOG.
It Will Swallow Air Until It Swelis
Into Invulnerability.
Of fishes a large number are pro
tected from hostile attack by a cov
ering of prickles. By far the most
curious examples are the globeflshes
or "sea hedgehogs" of the Atlantic
and Indo-Paciflc oceans. The extreme
length of the globeflsh Is something
less than two feet. It has thick lips
and goggle eyes, which give It the ap
pearance of a good natured country
man. Courage It seems to lack, and
one might suppose that such a sim
pleton would fall an easy prey to the
first shark or dogfish it encountered.
Yet the globeflsh is able to take care
pt Itself. It never under any circum
stances attacks the enemy, yet is al
ways ready to receive him in a suit
able manner should he provoke hostil
ities.
Let us suppose that a shoal of globe
fishes is swimming tranquilly In the
clear waters when it is suddenly sur
prised by a hungry shark. Of course
the little fellows scuttle hither and
thither in uncontrollable alarm. But
the shark, poising himself upon his
powerful tail, leisurely singles out one
of the fleeing globefishes and sets out
In pursuit Now, although the globe
flsh is a good swimmer, it is no match
for the shark. The chase is in every
way unequal and can have but one
ending. Within a few minutes of 'its
commencement the shark must over
take the globefish. But the quarry Is
well aware of its danger. It makes a
bee line for the surface and as soon as '
it gets there begins to take in great
gulps of air.
Then a strange thing happens. The
fish that only a moment before was
thin and small begins" to grow stouter
and stouter until, like the frog in the
fable, it seems In danger of bursting.
It stops Inflating itself, however, just
in time to avert this catastrophe. But
its skin has become as taut as a drum
head, and the whole of its body is cov
ered with sharp, erect prickles. It has
become a sea hedgehog, and the hun
gry shark which comes surging through
the water dares not touch it, but turns
tail in search of something more eata
ble. Of course the globefish was cov
ered with prickles all the time, but in
periods of tranquillity these lie com
fortably along Its sides. Just as do
those of the hedgehog. Unlike its
land prototype, however, the sea
hedgehog is unprovided with a special
muscle for erecting its prickles, so
when danger threatens it has recourse
to the mechanical method of inflating
the whole body with air or with wa
ter if It cannot reach the surface
quickly.— Scientific American.
TWO CHEERFUL LIARS.
A Queer Cherry Tree and a Back Ac-
tion Cannon Ball.
Mr. Finlayson, town clerk of Stirling
in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, was noted for the marvelous
the Earl of Jlonteith and Airth in his
castle of Taha, on the loch of Mon
telth, and was about taking leave
when lie was asked by the earl wheth
er he had seen the sailing cherry tree.
"No," said Finlayson. "What sort of
a thing is it?"
"It is," replied the earl, "a tree that
has grown out of a goose's mouth from
a stone the bird had swallowed and
which she bears about with her In
voyages round the loch. It Is just at
present in full fruit of the most exqui
site flavor. Now, Finlayson," he add
ed, "can you, with -all your powers of
memory and fancy, match the story of
the cherry tree?"
"Perhaps I can," said Finlaysou,
clearing his throat, adding, "When Oli
ver Cromwell was at Aith one of the
cannon sent a ball to Stirling and
lodged it in the mouth of a trumpet
which one of the troops In the castle
was Jn the act of sounding."
"Was the trumpeter killed?" said the
earl.
"Xo, my lord," said Finlayson. "He
blew -the ball backhand killed the artll
leryman who had fired it!"'— Pearson's

ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY.
The Greatest Literary Treasure That
the World Has Lost.
Perhaps the largest and most valu
able of literary treasures the world
has lost was the Alexandrian library.
This collection, the most remarkable^
of the ancient world, is said to have
contained iv Its most flourishing period
400,000 or, according to others, 700,
000 manuscripts. Its royal founder
collected from all nations their choic
est compositions. We are told that one
of his successors went so far as to re
fuse to supply the Athenians with
wheat until they had grven him the
original manuscripts of JEschylus.
Sophocles and Euripides. When Ju
lius Caesnr laid siege to the city the
greater portion of this library, was de
stroyed by fire. It was later replaced
by the collection presented to Queen
Cleopatra by Mark Antony. But it
was not destined to endure long.
When the Emperor Theodoslus the
Great In 391 A. D. ordered the destruc
tion of all heathen temples within the
Roman empire, the Christians, led by
the Archbishop Theophllus, did not
spare that of Jupiter, In which were
kept the literary treasures. From this
general destruction about 4,000 manu
scripts escaped, only to be burned In
640 by Saracens under the Caliph
Omar.— Arconaut

sire than it is to satisfy all that follow
It.— Franklin.

RAILROAD WRECKERS.
More Strenuous Workers Than Plr«
Fighters In Big Cities.
The career of the wrecker on a big
railroad is like that of a fireman iv
the fire department of a big city, only
more strenuous. Like the fireman, the
wrecker is on duty every second day
and night, and, like the fireman, the
wrecker braves blizzards and sleet
storms, often facing hardships and
cruel suffering and even death for
the saving of life and property. But
whereas even in emergency the fire
man never covers an area greater than
the most populous section of a city— the
line traversed by the wrecker covers a
hundred or more miles— and whereas
the fireman Is in touch with at least
such comforts as he may snatch while
on his feet not infrequently the wreck
er is landed in the heart of a wilder
ness miles and miles from the nearest
town, and the pangs of hunger aro
added to privation.
Sometimes when a big wreck has
happened and cars and engines are
piled high on crushed and mangled
bodies the wrecker is rushed through
darkness and snowdrift to work from
twenty-four to forty-eight hours with
out even a chance to take his cap off,
and just as his "job" is nearly complet
ed along comes another alarm that
sends him sixty or seventy miles in an
opposite direction, where box cars and
coal cars have heaped themselves thir
ty feet high, paralyzing- the road and
costing thousands of dollars' worth of
loss In time and prestige almost every
hour.
Despite these hardships, the danger,
the excitement and the bustle of the
work endear it to the men. A. W.

EASY FOR MORPHY.
Story of tho Great Chess Master and a
Celebrated Painting.
Paul Morphy, on his visit to Phila
delphia, was the guest of a clergyman,
the Rev. Mr. H. On his arrival at the
minister's home the chess master was
first ushered into the library, and his
attention was at once attracted by a
painting over the mantel, which was a
fine copy of a celebrated paiating rep
resenting a game of chess between a
young man and the devil, the stake be
ing the young man's soul.
The artist had most graphically de
picted the point In the game where it
was apparently the young man's move,
and he seemed just to realize the fact
that he had lost the game, the agony of
despair being shown in every line of
his features and attitude, while the
devil from the opposite side of the ta
ble gloated over him with fiendish de
light. The position of the game appear
ed utterly hopeless for the young man,
and Mr. H. said he had often set It up
and studied it with his chess friends;
and all agreed the young man's game
was certainly lost
when finally, turning to Mr. IT., he
said:
"I can win the game for the young
man."
Mr. H. was of course astonished and
said, "Is it possible?"
Air. Morphy replied, "Get out the
men and board and let us look at It."
The positioa was set up, and In a
few rapid moves he demonstrated a
complete win for the young man, and
the devil was checkmated.
Rice at Weddings.
At a wedding breakfast, according
to What to Eat, a bridesmaid was
heard to tell the true reason for rice
being used at weddings. It was once
believed that If on their wedding jour
ney a newly wedded couple saw a flock
of doves it would mean a long life of
peace and happiness to them. A bridal
party In passing so frightened a flock
of these timid birds that they flew
away in great alarm, and to avert the
evil omen that their flight signified for
the newly married ctuple rice was
thrown in great quantities to lure the
birds back to the place from which
they had flown. This plan was so
successful that the wedded pair went
on their way rejoicing and lived ever
afterward a happy and prosperous life.
Since then rice has been used as a
symbol of good luck, peace and happi
ness at weddings.
Variations of Cards.
t There are an enormous number of
possible variations of cards in card
games. Every man when he takes up
his cards at whist holds one out of 635,
013,550,600 possible hands. The total
number of variations possible among
all players Is so great as almost to ex
ceed belief. It has been calculated that
If a million men were to be engaged
in dealing cards at the rate of one deal
every minute day and night for'loo,
000,000 years they would have exhaust
ed only a hundred-thousandth port of
the variations of the cards.

FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 13. 1907 j
THE CELEBRATION MANAGEMENT.
As a rule tbe Ledger pays no atten- I
tion to the abusive remarks peddled
around by irresponsible parties.
When, however, the ill-will political
or otherwise it matters net, against
tbe editor is paraded on the occasion
of a public celebration, as was the
case on admission day in Jackson, we
■ deem it not out of place to make
some explanation thereon. la doiue
this, we may say tbat never during
our residence here has a celebration
been conducted on suoh narrow mind
• ed, prejudiced lines, as was that of
V the 9th* in Jackson. We do not meau to
say in a general way tbat native sons
of this or any other section are of
illiberal, prejudiced make-up. No
doubt the majority are fair-minded.
It has been circulated around that
»•-' tho Ledger refused to pay the aoiouut
subscribed; that the editor made no
attempt at decoratiou of the Webb
, building, aud would not allow others
to decorate; would jiot permit any
ropes to be attucbed to tho premises
to support tlio canvas covering over
the street, and so tortb. Now the
facts are these: A comitteeof Native
Sons waited upon us with a subscrip
tion list. We told them wa bad
heard thera were to be two celebra
tions—on labor day, also on the !ltb.
They did not know of any other ex
cept tbe one they were representing.
We put our name down for Ss— the
usual amount from printing offices on
suob occasions. In a public iiliaii.
paid for by private donations, it is
mc imbent upon those in oharge to
distribute auy patronage pertaining
to the celebration equally and fairly
among tbe business men subscribing
to the fund, and all sunia are listed
on that well-recognized basis. Any
glaring departuie from tbe rule le
lieves tbe person subscribing from
hid obligation, for the obligation to
pay is not one whit more sacred
than tbe obligation of the managers
to deal fairly and impartially. The
labor-day celebration was conducted
squarely on these lines. Shortly
after we were waited upon, we were
made aware tbat labor-day was also to
be. celebrated, and thereupon we
' srrtftr— titti wv = crecune'cno fiiaßeany"
distinction for or against either affair
i — that if there were two celebrations,
our subscription would be divided
equally between them, assuming of
couise that any printing patronage
would be subject to a fair division,
or lot by contract as a whole, — in
either case we would have been per
fectly satisfied.
A week or more passed, and we
noticed tfcat considerable printing
vca3 being done tor this celebration
committee, and every particle of it
was being steered into the Dispatch
office, probably in sympathy with the
. political proclivities of the managers.
And there was doubtless more print
ing done for tbe late 9th affair than
for any calebration Jackson has had
for many years In other respects
the discrimination policy in regard
to local interests was adopted. A
platform was built at one end of Main
• street, in opposition to Mrs Love's
hall business. The local band was
givn the go-by, and two foreign or
ganizations were eugaged to supply
music. Things were shaping to set
tho people ot tbe town at loggerheads,
whether intentionally or iguorautly
.we *ay not. Realizing that the
: Ledger ojttee was. signaled out as a
victim, we did uot propose that our
own money should play auy part iv
the victimizing scheme. To prevout
any misunderstanding, we tola oce
ot the committee that if the Ledger
was ignored in tho printing patron
age, the Ledger would consider itself
under no obligation to pay tbe
amount subscribed. We Boomed to
stoop to ask for any printing, but no
'" printing no subscription. In face of
this plain intimation, the committee
waited upon us some days afterwards,
to collect the amount, and in lieu of
cash we gave them a piece of our
mind.
The wiiter mado no effuit to dec
orate iv any way. ns far as the
fixing of Hags or bunting on the
brick front is concerned, he has quit
tbat for years, for good and sufficient
reasons 'This time not a flag nor any
thing was displayed anywhere as far
as be was concerned. This was in
tentionally done to empbasize the
work ot the celebration committee.
They ignoted him, he ignored them
their narrow-mindfid work. hut
•Jj falling to decorate in"auy manner,
*fee merely followed the' noteworthy
*^ample of tbe meeting place of the
native sons aud daughters across the
street, which was absolutely devoid
ot decoration of any kind.
A great pow wow was raised that
we had prevented the stable people
under thf> Webb hall from decniatiug.
This is untrue. We found them en
gaged in driving nails or tacks in the
wood work, without having asked our
permission. We informed them that
we declined to have our property
treated in that way. They were free
to do all tbe decorating they wanted
to in a manner that did not involve
tbe di-Uguremeut of tbe building.
We fancy if we started in with
hammer and tacka to drive several
hundred of these ornaments into tbe I *

Many years age in walking a sandy
bsaob of the South Pacific ocean, ive
came upon a child, who after scoop
ing out a shallow cistern in tbe saud,
was engaged in scoopiug up the sea
with both baud, aud depositing tIK
water in the holu. operation was
repented many times. It struck us
as so ttrange tbat we stopped beside
the little oue, and inquired, "May 1
H3k what you ate trying to do." Shu
replied, with all childish ingenuous
ness: I'm going to empty tbe sea
into that little bole." Tbat is just
about the task tbe celebiation
managers taxed themselves to ac
complish, without tbe frankness that
characterized the child.
tiver since the Ledger man has
been a resident uf Amador county,
covering a period of over thirty-two
years, be has been without seeking of
bis own, tbe subject of discussion in
political uiicles.in burlesque parades,
in newspaper articles, also ct misre
presentation even in amateur the
atricals. ;\o man in Amador county
has been more roundly abused thnn
be. We take this as tbe highest com
piimont that any citizen can receive,
fersiatent abuse is not the lot of the
woakliugs in character. Men don't
usually go hunting tomtits with a
battery of Krupp guns. Neither do
tbo army of political leeches, who
fatten by insistent tolls upon the
public, raise a perpetual outcry
against ono who stands in with them
iv tbe furtherance ot their schemes.
It is the man who opposes and ex
poses their schemes that calls down
place fillers.
Under the guiding hand of its pre
sent editor the Ledger has stood tor
honesty, economy and efficiency in
governmental affairs. Whether re
publicans or democrats have been in
control, the policy in this lespect has
never veered. Of course the Ledger
is not liked by manipulators and
their crew of underworked. We have
never oourted their favor, but have
invaiiably braved th,eir hostility
whenever we deemed tne interests of
the public demanded it. 11 may be
asked, what has been gained by this
long-dawo-out struggle. At the pre
sent tioio we are confronted with per
haps the most ironclad, wheel-withiu
wheel clique that ever held Amador
county in its clutches. What avails,
then, this unceasing conflict. Are we
any nearer the goal tur which we
have been struggling for io, these
many years. Perhaps not. But nby
no means follows that the efforts to
get iv the true path aie fruitless on
that accoaut. Who shall say what
the plight of Aanador would have
been to-day in the absence of these
efforts.
Ot the 230 men in line in the labor
day procession, about two hundred
were of Austrian or Slavonian nativ
ity. The matter was generally com
muted upon at tbe time. Sncb an
overwhelming prepondeiauce of one
foreign element is a cause for serious
apprehension. The minority of
about thirty was composed ot Corn
ish miners, Italians and native born
citizens. Ihe country is being eaten
up by tha foreign invasion. And to a
greater or less extent the same con
ditions exist all over the northern
and western states. The deluge oi
over one million immigrants pouriug
into the country every year is dis
astrous from every standpoint.
STAMMERING.
Caused More Often by Habit Than by
Defective Vocal Organs.
"Stammering is often more the re
sult of habit than from any defect of
the vocnl organs," says an authority.
"It ls generally, if not always, caused
by a spasm of the larynx, resulting
from nervous contraction of the or
gans, thus refusing to permit a proper
Cow of the air current producing tone.
People rarely or never stammer -when
singing, for then the attention Is di
vided between words and music, the
nervousness is momentarily forgotten
and the passage of the air current
through the larynx ls continuous and
unobstructed.
"Stammering very often ls the re
sult of Imitation, sometimes Intention
al, sometimes unconscious, ami the af
fliction Is much more general than
might be supposed. In one compara
tively small section of the city there
are thirty-five stammerers, and every
one of them is able to demonstrate to
his own satisfaction not only that he
does not stammer very badly, but that
some other person he knows stammers
a great deal worse than himself.
Every stammerer is intensely sensitive
about his infirmity, rarely forgives and
never does forget any allusion to It
which In his mind savors of ridicule."—

THE "MARSEILLAISE."
It Was Written by Rouget de Lisle In
One Brief Hour.
Ou April 25, 1702, Rouget de L.isle,
the military engineer, who had assum
ed thi? aristocratic prefix to become an
officer, was a guest at a banquet given
by Baron Dietrich, first mas-or of
Strassburg. '
Patriotic excitement was at its
height. "Marehonsl" "Aux aruies, clto
yens!" were phrases on every Up. But
as the champagne went round the la
dies grew weary and pleaded for nn
other topic. Patriotic songs? A hymn
for the army of the Rhine? Something
better thnn the jingling "Ca ira!" The
host first suggested a public competi
tion and a prize. Then he turned to
Rouget de Lisle and asked him to
"compose a noble song for the French
people."
Rouget de Lisle tried to excuse him
self. Again the champagne passed
round, and just as the party broke up
a fellow office;- about to quit Strassburg
next day begged De Lisle for a copy of
his forthcoming song.
"I make the promise on behalf of
your comrade," Dietrich>replied.
Rouget de Lisle reached his lodging
close by, but not to sleep. His violin
lay on the table. Taking it up, he
struck n few chords. Soou a melody
seemed to grow under his fingers. No
sooner had he put down the notes than
he dashed off the words.
Thus having in a brief hour secured
for himself an undying name he threw
himself upon his bed and slumbered
heavily.— Reader Magazine.
Its Fire and Its Girdle Cakes.
The Chequers inn, Osmotherle.v, is &
relic of the old coachiug days, but it is
now famed for its fire, which has nev
er been out for more than 100 years
and over which girdle cakes are baked.
This huge fire is kept continually burn
ing by peat or turf from the Yorkshire
moors. An excellent tea is provided
for visitors, the chief dainty being the
girdle cakes. The peat glows like red
embers on a red tiled floor, the girdle
being suspended from a bar above, the
whole looking most quaint and pictur
esque. The exterior of the inn is most
unpretentious and old world looking,
as it nestles alone on the Yorkshire
wolds. — London Standard.

T The Dispatch last mouth put in a
b bill for envelopes in Ibis wise:
0000 00 ii}i envelopes * .'- '■'■ Kj3Kj 82.50
E Express ... 1.00
M Mow 82.50 is the schedule price for
5 00 envelopes of that size. . But
w where in the name of fairness does
t the extra charge of SI for expressage
c come in. That is a new way of
d double-crossing the county, and the
s supervisors let it pass as U. K. \ Ac-
c cording to this interpretation the
p printing schedule fixed over 10 years
a ago, means that the printer may tor
o ordinary, every-day articles, such as
e every printer is supposed to keep on
h hand, charge express rates tioai San
F Francisco in addition to the estub
lliahed_price.lliahed_price. That is a new departure
i in .the game ot fleecing ' A mad or
county. ' /
llnI In accordance with this new prin-
c ciple injected into county atlairs for
t tho purpose ot gouging the taxpayers
i it will be in order for those supplying
g goods to county officers to ring in ex-
p pressagn on each item. Of course it
m may depend upon who puts in the bill
w whether it will pass muster or not. It
w wonld'nt go if ' the Ledger happened
t to be essaying the role of gouger. The
. .Ledger not only scorns to stoop to
s such disgraceful practices, hut will
e expose them whenever perpetrated by
o others. The finalluess of such tactics
t to evade a plain obligation is beneath
c contempt. And yet the government of
. .■Wnadcr is being conducted, whether
w wilfully or ignorantly, or through a
n negligence that borders on criminal-
i ity, it matters not, upon that very
p plane, not only in the case now cited
b but a number of other instances of a
s similar nature which have been ven
tilated of late in these columns. A
board of supervisors may not be open
to condemnation simply because it
h has been imposed upon. Imposition
id of supeivisnrs may not be open
condemnation simply because it
been imposed upon. Imposition
m may succeed once in a while, and in
s spite of ordinary safeguards to pre-
v vent it. iJist when it becomes chronic
a and notorious and absolutely nothing
i is done to stop it, then that sings
a a different song.

Extraordinary Proceeding.
In looking over the minutes of the
last nieetiug of tbe Loard of super
risers, us entered at length in the
minute book, we lind tbis paragraph
therein :
It is moved, seconded and carried
by the unanimous vote of tbe board
that tbe article printed iv tbe Ama
dor Ledger July 19, 1907, be answered
by publishing tbe facts iv ths Aina
dur Dis-patcb, and tbe clerk was
ordered and instructed to sign each
supervisors name to said statement.
lhia minute, has never before been
published, ami it was merely by acci
dent tbat wo stumbled across it at
tbis time. We usually take Our notes
of the proceedings each month from
the clerk's minutes in tbe rough, aud
tbis particular clause either was not
therein, or escaped notice. Tbe ap
pearance of the article branding a
portion of tbe Ladgei's . account of
the proceediuga of tho board of
equalization as false, with names of
all the supervisors thereto appended,
was seemingly the outcome ot this
delegation of authority to the deck
to sign the names. From this it
appears tbat the publication was not
actually signed by tbe supervisors
themselves; and by iufeience it
follows I hiit tftey never saw the
article until it appeared in print,
they did not know what sort of a
statement of so-called facts they were
beiug made responsible for. When
tbe conteuts ot the article were made
kuowu— or rather, when that article
was shown to be fuitber from the
tiutb than the article it was intended
to correct, it then came out that they]
never signed it, aud did not iudorse
its statements. It is certainly a most
peculiar proceeding when names aro
signed by proxy iv tbis way to a
document intended for publication.

TIIF AMADOR .LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1907.
ADMISSION DAY CELEBRATION.
A Large Crowd in Attendance, and
Interesting Exercises.
Admission day, Monday, September
Oth, was intended to tie the biggest
gala time ever witnessed iv Jaakson.
It would probably have turned out
that way had it fallen iuto the right
hands as far as the management is
concerned, and been conducted in the
spirit of tairnesa and impartiality
that should always characterize such
affairs. Unit it was not so managed,
however, was not the fault of the
geueral puoiic, but of a small coterie
who tried to steer it in the narrow
groves of prejudioe and spite.
The main feature of the celebration,
outside of the dancing platform, was
ttio procession, and the attempt to
decorate the streets and buildings. A
string of electric lights was installed
in the center ot Main stret from the
north budge to the National hotel.
Strings ot streamers were placed
acros3 tusstroet at intervals of twenty
teet so, with different colorj of small
piaoas of bunting, uu.l printed Mative
Sous emblems, bearing the words.
"A. S. U. W. Welcome" This was
intended as a geueral welcome to all
comers, of coarse, whether born" in
this or any other state or county.
Some of the buildings were artistical
ly decomttod, foremost among them
baiag tu9 Hem saloaa and the tiari
fcaldi saloon, the National hotel
and bank. Most places were con
tent with a moderate display of the
California colors aud a flag or t.vo,
aud some displayed only tne Ameri
oan Has. which embraces in its sacred
folds all the states without sectional
iistiuccions. The offer of ten doiltirs
tor tile baat decoratoi building creat
ed littlo rivalry. IJ.it as a whole the
city look quite attractive to the
strauger from whichever direction he
entered.
I II 9 precision wa3 formad at 10 ::50,
i inder the marshalship of Lawrence
B Burke, the following aids— W. M.
A Amick, A. Grillo, D. t3«lari, if.
W White, May Hose, Kate Garbarini,
W Winnie Uafreae Mrs, & V. Zumbiol.
l lt was arranged in about the follow
iing order:
1. Native Son 3 band of Sacramanto,
of fifteen pieces, furnishing strong
and excellent music. Native Sons
aud Daughters of Sutter Creek parlors
about thirty strong. Native Daugh
ters ot Ursula pad or, 23 in number;
N. S. U. W. Excelsior parlor, 46 iv
number. Float "California." drawn
by four horsoj abreast. Miss Julia
Ginooohio reprasented the golden
atate, with cornucopia and an infant
reposing in the lap uf plenty, and a
stuffed bear, all daiikeJ in yelios aad
gold, and very nicely gotteu up. It
vvß3 greeted with cheers all along the
lins. This float wa3 gotten up by the
Native Sons. 'The Native Daughters'
float was equally well designed, with
four black horses, Mis 3 Auuie Pero
vich representing Minerva. The rlo.it
was decorated with California
poppies, arraugei tastily and giviug a
most pleasing effect. Tae crowds
(\heerod thi3 design to the echo. Tog
A, O. U. D. of Jaokson followed 31
iv number. The Italian Society aud
the Austrian Benevolent Society, over
100 stroog constituted by far the
largest part of the pedestrian? iv
line. A float of Oro Fino Circle
Companions of the forest came next.
The military company ot Unifoim
Hank K. of P. in uniform and num
bering 17 was ainoug the more notice
able features executing various ma
nuvers during the march. A float by
the Social and Athletic Club was in
tended we presume to be filled with
the membsrs of that organization, in
-tend it was set apart to be:;r tha
piouesrs. Taen caaie carriages, con
taining notable pioneers. Of the=e
we noticed Mr and Mr 3 Jas. Meehan
Mrs Buttlngton, Mrs Abramofsky and
Mrs b'rodlich, also the veteran
miner and old timer Charley Peters,
togged out in '19 costume and W. P.
l J eek. A carriage bearing the officers
of tbu day completed the t urnout.
An innovation from the usual plan
was the holding of tiu literary
exercises in the afternoon. This was
a good move, a3 it avoided all the
uurry aud ruah to get through by the
noon hour. The exercises were held
iv front of the Amarlor Bank, ou a
platform erected specially fur that
purpose. J. Jacks of Calaveras was
president of the day. Key. father
Kennedy chaplain, with siuging by
the choir and music by the band
interspersed. The orator was Li. V.
Bvington ot San Krauoisno. It was
uext to impossible to catch more
lhan a sentence here and there of his
oration, notwithstanding be spoke in
a fairly strong voice. The din of sub
dued voices and shuffling of feet pre
vented the hearing of the spoaker on
the opposite side of the etreet. His
talk wa3 principally ot California and
the native sons organization. He
kept the attention ot t'ao audienco
trom beginning to end.
The prize for the best float mi
awarded to the Native Daughters float
Minerva, 810.
For the be3t decorated building tlio
Natioual hotel carried off the honor,
vi.i the awaid, 310.
b'or the most original get oif iv the
Horribles parade, the dry goods bnx
marked "Webb building" was doeru
ed entitled to the premium, 35. The
vehicle was driven by li. Newman
aurl Geo. l-'olger represented Webb.
The athletic contests in the after
noon were on a very limited scale.
There was a boys' race tor a prize of
i' 2 wou by Wallace Potter of Ply
mouth, and 61 for second prize fell to
Marion Calvin. A girls' race for like
prizes, was captured by Violet Love;
second prize Julia I'oppiauo. A
doukey raoa for 31.50 wou by C
Savage; and pole valting S5 wou by
Whitney Kust concluded this feature.
The Horribles took possession, of the
street at 4 o'clock. It was a limited
affair, the only thing that attracted
notice was the burlesque of the Webb
building aud the editor ot the
Ledger. -It seemed to amuse two or
hrae townspeople immensely, but
tbe "thers couldn't see its import or
appropriateuees.
It is reported that the participants
in this feature were lined expressly
tor that, purpose. But whether soj or
not makes no difference. The man
agement sanctioned it by permitting
it, and therefore must bear tbe odium.
A scarf drill participated in by 20
young ladies under tbe tuitiou cf Mrs
Winning, was gone through ou the
open platform at 7:30, and was oue of
the prettiest features of the day.
This was followed by an electrical
float parade, consisting of tbe floats
of the morning procession, the Native
daughters, the Uniform Kank and a
drum corp of eight young ladies,
drilled for tho occasion by H. K.
Kay.
A grand ball in tbe evening on the
large platform adjoining brought tbe
celebration to a close. Music was
furnished by Pattern & Springer's
orchestra of Lodi. The platform was
crowded to its utmost capacity, and
daucing was kept up till 4 a. m.
Tbe business men appear to iiave
been satisfied with the celebration
from a financial standpoint. Some
places did a very profitable trade; and
altogether it came up to expectations.
From tbe committee's standpoint
according to all rumors, there is »
deficit, it is proposed to ttg to play
even by giving dauce.n on the plat
form.
Accident at the Standard
Electric Plant.
An accideut, involving a very seri
ous luss from a financial point, oc
curred at the Standard Electric power
plaut at Electra o:i Tnosdav evening.
One oi' the buckets of the large water
wheel broko, and f*e ro3ultaut dh
turbauce in the distribution ot the
power paused thereny was the uuder
lying cause of mischief, ihreeof the
seven dynamos were put out of com
mission, among them being the t.vu
large machine?. One of tho latter
was burned out completely aud is
about a total loss. The other wss
badly_ "damaged, but nan be repatred.
There was a lively display of fireworks
while th\j power was being shut off
from the water wheels. This cannot
bo clone instantly, as tbe sudden
shutting of the gates thereby throw
ing the pressure upon the pipe line,
would inevitably lead to disaster.
Fortunately not a man ou the pre
mises was injured during the exciting
time of the trouble. Other dynamos
were started, and the current was
again furuishiug power in about half
an hour after the aocident.
The damage is variously estimated,
but will undoubtedly run up to formi
dable figures. l'he large dynamo;
cauuot ba replaced on tbis coi^t
The plaut is running to its capacity
with the reserve machines. One of
the big machines that was damaged
oan be lestored to working order ie a
few days. G. H. Bragg, former
superintendent of the plant, came up
from San Fiaucisoo Wednesday to
look into the matter. It is conceded
thiit the disaster was unavoidable,
and no blame attaches to tbe em
ployes therefor. \
Some idea of the destructive force
exertod may be gained when we state
that the broken bucket of the wator
wheel weighed 400 pounds. The
wheel wa3 goiug at a speed of 400 re
volutions per minute. The iron hood
that covered the wheel baited to a
massive concrete foundation, was
twisted at one cud like paper, and
castiron piates l' a inches thick were
snapped iv several places. Pieces of
iron were hurled iv all directions',
and it is miraculous that no one was
hurt by the flying missies. The iron
hood may be seen at Garbarini Bros,
machine shop, where it has been re
moved to be repaired.
Since tho accident all the quartz
mills ot the couuty operating by elec
tric power have been compelled to
close a portion of each day. These
include the Zaila, Kennedy, Central
Eureka, Bunker Hill and Fremont.
From six o'clook p. m. until teu or
nfter the close down is on. That is
the time when the heavy travel is on
in the street railroads in the cities.
It is hoped that in a day or two the
plaut will be in condition to carry
all the business the same as before
the mishap, although considerable
time must elapse before the-damuge
oau lie fully overcome.
The I. and E. Railroad.
John Kaggio, the receiver appointed
by the superior court to take charge
of the 1. and EL Koad has, returned
to Stockton, having placed in charge
a gentleman named MoPhersou trom
San Francisco. The expenses ot the
road are being cut down wherever
practicable. The number ot omployej
13 baiug reduced. It is believed that
the fore3lo3ure suit will be pressed to
a determination as soon as
aud that the road will permanently
changa hands. Tno parties who are
interested in the suit, or some of
them, are also interested in the ex
tension of tho road from Valley
Spring to the timber belt above West
Poiut iv Calaveras couuty. It was
thought that by extending the Ama
dor line, the timber region of Cala
veras might also be reached, aud that
the double line might thereby be
avoided. This, however, is not pro
bable, as the timber oo both sides of
tbe Mokelnmne river, cannot be
marketed by one road, ou acaount of
the engineering difficulties that would
be encountered. So that whether the
disposal of our local line will hasten
or indefinitely postpone the proposed
extension to the Atnad.ir timber
region is still undetermined.

Contest Over Whitmore Estate.
A contest of the will of the late F.
M. Whitmore, or more prnperly
speaking the codicil to said will, has
been commenced in the superiur
court by relatives of tbe deceased
living outside of this county. The
contestants are O. Scott Whitmore of
Pasadena, Cal., Frauk li. Whitmore
of the National Home, Wisconsin,
brothers ot deceased, Clara Whitmore
■md' Mrs Frauces Streeter, sisters,
Loth of Fitohbnrg, Mas.s., Herbert
Whitinure, a ucpLe.v, and Nellie
Whitmore a niece, both of Leo
minster, Mass. J'he alleged grounds
of contest are fraud aud undue in
fluence brought to bear upou the de
ceased while in a weak condition
from a loug sickness from Hrigbt's
disease to make the codicil changing
the conditions in tbe original will.
The main will was made and executed
January 9, 1903, the deceased at that
time being of snaud body and mind
considering his advanced age — he
being over 80 years old at that time.
By the terms of this will the
legatees were Mrs Lacy Webstor, a
neioo to whom was bequeathed the
sum of §5,000 and Mrs Ada Mason,
to whom was given §2.500 according
to the contestants petition for revoca
tion of the codicil. The codicil 13
dated January 30, 1907, only a few
days before death occurred; and by
its teim3 the sum of 52500 is be
queathed la Mr 3 Mason instead of
SjOOO; and 57500 instead ot S?5000 to
Mrs Webster. The object seems to
have beon to take awajj 8i r >oo from
Mrs Mason and increase the legacy
of Mrs Webster in that amount.
Whereas the original will bequeaths
only the sum of 82300 to Mrs Mason.
The petition asking tor revocation
of the order of court admitting tbe
will to probate, alleges as tbe grounds
of contest. That the testator did Dot
allix his signature to the codicil, nor
authorize the said signature by any
person in his presence. That he did
not at auy time declare the said docu
ment was tbe codicil to his last will.
Ibat at tbe time of making said
codicil, the testator was not of a
sound and disposing mind. That he
was nut at that time free from undue
influence, but was wholly under the
influence of W. K. Webster, Lucy J.
Webster and Ada B. Mason. That
while suffering from Brigbt's disease,
and weak therefrom in body ami
mind, he was induced to execute rj
codicil, whereby he gave to Lucy J.
Webster and Ada Mason, a large
amount of valuable property, both
real and personal in addition to large
bequests given in bis will. K. C.
Bole and W. J. McGee are attorneys
tor contestants, and ask for a revoea
tion and that the said codicil be de
cline;! null aud void, and also for
costs of suit. The object of this con
test seems to be to shut out the
additional legacies in the codicil. It
does not seek to attack the original
will. With tbe codicil out of the
way, whatever estate was left after
paying tbe legacies of tbe will
propor, would be shared in by all the
heirs.

How Octogenarians were Treated.
The grotesque feature of the admis
sion day parade was the float ot the
'athletic club. The boys contemplat
ed patting up an imposiog alfair.
They mapped out; tba thing on a huge
soale. When it was partially con
structed they discovered that it was
altogether too big for the occasion
that it couldn't be navigated over
tbe main bridge. So the skeleton
was hauled in front of the clnb'a
quarters to undergo tbe reduction
procoss, and rfioeive iU artistic dross
ot many colors. The decorative art
ist got a move on, and so did father
time. The eventful day found the
would-be float a long way from home
—a big platform mounted on wheels,
and labeled "Jackson Athletic Club."
It was big eDough to accommodate
tbe members of clubdom, and was
built with that object. But tbe boys
were disgusted with its barebone
make-up. They wouldn't ride in it.
Finally four old pioneers, for whose
accommodation carriages could not
be found, were induced to take pass
age thereiu. The four gueats were J.
M. Myers, Jabez Wilds, John Martin
and Peter Luke— all eighty yeais or
over, athletes of '49 days. There was
no provision tor entering the shack,
no door or gate. Athletes needed not
conveniences— they could climb any
where. But for these four pioneers
tbe getting in problem was a serious
one. A ladder solved the problem.
After jolting over tbe rough road in
this lumber wagon, one of tbe pass
engers became sick, and wanted to
escape. The getting out part was on
a par with getting in. Finally be
tore a gap in the buntine and crawled
out, and managed to land ou terra
firina, and made a break for a bed
wbere be might recover from his
jaunt. The last heard from him, be
was still suffering a recovery, he says
he was never so shabbily treated in
his life. He has long since got over
tun flush of bis athlete days, but now
finds it an extremely slow process to
get over bis ride in the athletio wagon
on admission day.

Obituary.
Samuel Hewitt Loree, a pioneer
resident of Ihe Upper Kancheria sec
tion, died at bis ranch, some eight
miles from Oleta, daring the last
days of August, at tbe advanced age
of 82 years. He was a native of Ohio,
but bad lived in California since
early days. Death was caused by the
infirmities incident to extreme age.
He was a single man, and lived alone
on tbe homestead. He at one time
ran tor district attorney on the re
publican ticket. He bas no relatives
in this state, so far as we have beard,
and leaves no estate worthy of atten
tion at tbe bands of the public ad
ininiatiator.
Mrs Tborras Kicbards died at her
home in Amador City on Saturday,
August 7, after a long illness. She
was a native of California, aged about
35 yeprs. Besides ber sorrowing bns

seige of illness. Some two years ago
a swelling commenced about tbe
glands of tbe neck, and rapidly in
creased until be was compelled to
desist from all manual labor. In the
earlier stages of tbe complaint be
went to San Francisco to work, bot
was forced to return here by tbe in
convenience and pain of tbe tumor.
He submitted to a surgical operation
some months ago, which attorded
much relief, and prolonged life, bat
did not effect a radical cure, tbe
abnormal growth gradually returned,
and was diagnosed as of a tuber
culosis nature. He leaves a wite and
two small children, also his parents
and a brother and one sister. He was

Women Who Wear Well.
l lt is astonishing how great a change a
f few years of married life often make in
t the appearance and disposition of many
■women. The freshness, the charm, the
b brilliance vanish like the bloom from a
p peach which is rudely handled. The
m matron is only a dim shadow, a faint echo
o of the charming maiden. There are two
■ reasons for this change, ignorance and
n neglect. Few young women appreciate
t the shock to the . system through the
c change which comes with marriage and
m motherhood. Many neglect to deal with
• the unpleasant pelvic drains and weak-
n nesses which too often come with mar
rriage and motherhood, not understanding
t that this secret drain is robbing the cheek
o of its freshness and the form of its

LOVE'S TEST.
Where Her Great Help Was Needed
Her Heart Was Willing.
"Professor," said the fair co-ed after
a pause, "let me ask you if you ever
use the phrase 'different than?' "
"Never!" exclaimed the young pro
fessor of rhetoric and English litera

"I am glad we have something in
common," she rejoined. "Neverthe
less, Professor de Purey, I cannot be

"Mr. Koopong," asked the young wo
man, with downcast eyes, "now that I
happen to think of it, do you ever use
the phrase 'different than?' "
"I certainly do not," said the enam
ored capitalist. "It is not only incor
rect, but utterly absurd."
"I am glad to hear you say so. Still,
Mr. Koopong, it is useless to urge me.
I never can be anything more to you

"Let me ask you one question, Mr.

"Why— er— l presume I have used it

Miltal Medicine
A somewhat eccentric physician who
recently died would order patients to
take walks, say dally, on the left side
ot the street, returning by the other
side; another he would order to arise
each morning at a certain hour and
eat cheese with ginger beer; another to
take supper precisely at midnight and
eat only apples, or he would instruct
the patient to put just so many grains
of salt on the egg he was to eat and
part his hair in a different way each
day. His object was to get the mind
of the patient on something else than
symptoms, and this scheme worked
well in many cases, .especially when
the patient was sufEeirtng from melan
cholia.—New York Times.

DANGEROUS PIGS.
The Fearless Mexican Peccary Will
Fight Man or Beast.
A writer in the St. Louis Republic
says that the most vicious and fearless
member of the brute creation is the
peccary, or wild hog, of Mexico. This
animal seems utterly devoid of fear
and displays an intelligence In fighting
man strangely at variance with its ap
parently complete lack of mental at
tributes.
Their ability to scent man is particu
larly marked. The only thing to do
when they get after you is to run
fway from them as fast as a horse
can carry you, and then there is no
certainty that they won't catch you.
They are nearly as swift as a horse,
and their endurance is as great as
their viclousness.
A friend of mine encountered a
drove of them in a wild part of Mexico
a few years ago, and his escape was
almost miraculous. He very foolishly
shot and wounded a number of them.
Then he took refuge In a tree.
The peccaries kept him in the tree all
that day and through the night They
circled round the tree, grunting and
squealing their delight at the prospect
of a feast He soon exhausted his am
munition and brought down a peccary
at each fire, but this had no terrors for
the beasts.
Toward morning they began to eat
those he had killed, after which they
formed in line and trotted off. If they
had not had some of their own number
to devour they would have guarded
that tree until my friend through sheer
exhaustion dropped from hte perch and
Allowed them to make a meal of him.
The wildcats and tigers that infest
the Mexican wilds flee from the pec
caries with instinctive fear, and even
rattlesnakes keep ont of then* path.
A Pretty Fast Clock.
He was standing in front of the cir
cular elevator indicator In one of the
office buildings, watch in hand. It was
the morning after, and I suppose that
he had forgotten to concern himself
with the frivolous detail of winding
his timepiece the previous evening.
His equilibrium was far from stable,
and his eyes, unsteadily following the
indicator hand, blinked with efforts at
comprehension as he tried to set his
watch.
"'Dlculous clock (hie)— very 'musing
(hie)— very fast pace we live (hie)
thesh days (hie)— pretty fast fer my
ole timer (hie)— 'diculous— can't seem
V catch it (hie)— whoa!— there you are

I left him still trying to get his
watch into conformity with the speed
ing indicator.— Boston Traveler.
How a Flea Jumps.
It is said that a flea leaps 200 times
Its height, and while it usually does
land on Its feet, it often fails, especial
ly when it falls on a perfectly smooth
surface, where the claws can get only
a slight hold. A flea has six legs,
whose great length and bulk make
them so heavy that they must be a
great help In keeping their owner right
side up when it makes one of those
gigantic Jumps, and when it lands up
side down or in some other way its
ability to kick is so great that not more
than one wriggle is needed to set things
right. A flea's wings are mere scales
end of no use. But small and worth
less as they are, they tell the entomolo
gist something about the proper classi
fication of the Insect To the flea Itself
they have no value.— St. Nicholas.
Polishing Small Articles.
It Is said that a high polish may be
obtained after nickel plating on small
steel articles, such as screws, by tum
bling them with leather and dry rouge.
The articles are placed In a tumbling
barrel with leather scraps. Some dry
rouge is put into the barrel along with
the screws and leather and the whole
tumbled for some time. The rouge
coats the Burface of the leather and
causes It to act like a polishing wheel.
Canvas scraps may be used In place of
leather.

THE AMADOK LEDGrEB: JACKSUfr, UALIFOB]3IA, FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 13, 1907.
THE TRAIN BELL ROPE.
How It and the Conductor's Supremacy
Came to Be Established.
Although there does not seem to be
anything In common between pugilism
, and railroad rules, yet the adoption of
the familiar bell rope that stretches
through every car of the modern train
was the result of a fistic encounter. At
the same time and by the issue of the
i same combat the supremacy of the con
i ductor in railroad travel was ordained.
It was Philadelphia which gave both
to the world.
One of the oldest railroads in the
country is the Philadelphia, Wilming
ton and Baltimore, now known as the
Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washing
ton, which was opened in 1837. The
terminus In Philadelphia was at Broad
and Prime streets— Prime street now
being known as Washington avenue —
and after crossing the Schuylkill river
>t Gray's Ferry the route ran along the
Delaware river on what ia now the
Chester line of the Reading railway.
The first schedule contained one pas
senger train, which went. to Baltimore
one day and came back the next, which
was considered a remarkable feat in
rapid travel. When a train a day each
way was placed in service the people
of the two cities served concluded that
the acme of convenience in transporta
tion had been reached.
Next to the president of the railroad
l:he most important functionaries were
the engineer and conductor. It was a
question whether or not the head of
Ihe line was not considered a subsidi
ary officer In popular estimation to the
men who ran the train, but Robert
Fogg, who pulled the throttle, and
John Wolf, who collected fares, won
the deference of the public because of
their high and responsible duties.
Fogg, an Englishman, had all the
tenacity of opinion of his race. Wolf,
an American, had the ingenuity of the
Yankee aud, seeing the need of some
method by which he could communi
cate with the engineer, devised the
scheme of running a cord through the
cars to the locomotive. As the engine
was a wood burner, Wolf fastened one
end of the cord to a log, which was
placed on the engineer's seat and was
pulled to the floor when the conductor
desired to signal for a stop.
Fogg resented what he considered an
interference with his rights on the
platform of the locomotive and on the
first run out from Broad and Prime
streets with the new device paid no
heed to the displacement of the log
from the seat when the conductor de
sired to take on a passenger from a
farm near Gray's Ferry, but sped on
over the bridge and did not deign to
bring his engine to a stop until Blue
Bell station, on the south side of the
Schuylkill, had been reached. Then
he demanded to know of Wolf why he
had been jerking that log all about the
locomotive.
Wolf hotly declared that he had sig
naled to stop, but Fogg retorted that
he would stop when and where he
pleased and that, too, without any ref
erence to orders from the conductor,
whom he did not regard as his superior
in the management of the train. The
altercation grew very heated, and Wolf
invited the engineer from the cab to
settle the matter, and the challenge
was quickly accepted.
Passengers and a group of men who
had gathered at the station to see the
train come hi formed a ring about the
combatants, but the fight did not last
long, as Wolf proved by far the su
perior artist with his fists and with
a few blows made it almost impossible
for the engineer to see suinciently to.
complete his run, but Fogg admitted
that he had been fairly beaten, and the
supremacy of the conductor on a train
was settled for all time.
As the log signal was crude and in
effective, Wolf devised the use of a
bell on the locomotive, and this method
was soon adopted by all of the Amer
ican railroads. Then a code of sig
nals was adopted, and these remain
practically to this day. The only
change in the bell cord is that by use
of the air from the brake system a
whistle has superseded the bell in the
locomotive cab.— Philadelphia Ledger.
Clay's Ready Wit.
When Henry Clay was stumping ■
Kentucky for re-election, at one of his
mass meetings an old hunter of wide !
political Influence said, "Well, Harry, J
I've always been for you, but because I
of that vote (which he named) I'm
goin' agin you."
"Let me see your rifle," said Clay.
It was handed to him.
"Is she a good rifle?"
"Yes."
"Did she ever miss fire?"
"Well, yes, once."
"Why didn't you throw her away?"
The old hunter thought a moment
and then said, "Harry, I'll try yon
again."
And Harry was elected.

thing— not a well written story in it—
and I told St. Peter so."
"What did he say?"

GUM ARABIC.
The Two Classes, Amberlike and
Bleached, and Their Uses.
Gum arable, which forms one of the
more important minor exports ot
Egypt, is really the sap from a special
kind of tree which grows from three
to five yards in height, whole forests of
which are found in the Kordofan prov
ince and also near Gedid, in the White
Nile province. The natives are free
to collect the gum. The season during
which the trees yield their sap runs
from December to May. Prior to gath
ering the crop the natives prepare the
trees by slightly cutting the bark in
numerous places. The sap then ex
udes, solidifies in the shape of large
and small lumps and is afterward gath
ered by hand, such gathering being
done before the rainy season com
mences.
There are two main classes of gum
amberlike and bleached. In the latter
the gum is merely exposed to the
strong action of the sun— generally in
Omdurman — while in the former in
stance it is allowed to retain its nat
ural amber color. The confectionery
trade is perhaps the principal purchas
er of gum arabic, though a very large
number of other industries— chemical
works, printing and dyeing mills, let
ter press printers and so on— are inter
ested in this product of Sudan.—Chica

PAYING THE PENALTY.
The Way Beckmann Becjged Frankel's
Pardon Before Witnesses.
One day Beckmann, the comic actor,
was induced to take off a well known
newspaper editor, Frankel by name, in
one of the characters he was repre
senting in Berlin. He performed his
task so cleverly that at the close the
audience broke out into loud calls for
Frankel. The journalist brought an
action, and Beckmann was coudemned
to go to the house of the insulted par
ty and there beg his pardon in the
presence of witnesses. At the hour ap
pointed Frankel sat in the circle of his
family, together with a number of re
lations and friends who had been con
vened for the occasion, waiting the ar
rival of the delinquent. He tarried
long, and half an hour had passed in
weary suspense when at last the door
opened, and Beckmann put his head In
and asked:
"Does Mr Meier live here?" .
"Oh, no," answered Frankel. "He
lives next door."
"Ah, then, I beg your pardon," said
the actor and hastily withdrew, hav
ing thus acquitted himself of the im
posed penance, to the great annoyance
of Frankel and the intense amusement
of the assembled witnesses. — London

Posters In Paris.
French law gives the authorities of
every village aud commune complete
control over posters. "Xo one," writes
our consul general, "Is permitted in
France to deface streets and public
places with crude, ostentatious an
nouncements of his business -or other
subject. Billboards are Infrequent in
Paris and are generally built perma
nently into a wall, where they are tax
ed according to their superficial area.
When a building is in construction and
board screens are erected to shield the
public from dust and other annoyance
pueh temporary screen will soon be
covered with posters of amusements
and other business, but each poster so
displayed has been previously submit
ted to the authorities, a license obtain
ed, and each sheet bears the canceled,
revenue stamp, according to its size."
A Long Swim.
A tramp has beaten all known rec
ords by swimming twenty-seven miles
In thirty minutes. He did not mean to
do it. He merely tried to steal a ride
from St. Louis to Chicago on the rear
of a locomotive tender. When the
train started he fell over backward
through the open manhole into the
water tank. The noise of the train
drowned his cries for help, and he was
obliged to swim until the first stop
was reached at Alton. When taken
out he was nearly dead, but the engi
neer was so unfeeling as to call his at
tention to the fact that the water was
only four feet deep, and he might have
stood up. The conductor, also unfeel
ing, asked him for his ticket, but the
tramp said he had not come by rail,
but by water. — Youth's Companion.

CHESS CLOCKS.
There Are Specially Constructed Onea
Used In the Game.
Hourglasses, or sandglasses, were
formerly used for the purpose of meas
uring time at chess matches, but now
specially constructed clocks are ha gen
eral use for this purpose. These clocks
consist of two clocks mounted on a
common base, which moves on a pivot,
the two clocks therefore being ou the
arms of a sort of seesaw. The beam,
or base, is so constructed that when
one clock is elevated it stands perfect
ly perpendicular, while the depressed
clock lies over at an angle, but as the
mechanism of each clock is so con
structed that it only moves when the
clock is perfectly perpendicular it fol
lows that when the upright clock Is
going the depressed clock is at rest.
Another and more modern variety
has the two clocks fixed on the same
level, but with a small brass arm
reaching from the top of one to the top
of the other. This arm acts on a pivot
and can be brought down into actual
contact with one clock at a time by a
touch of the finger. When it is thus In
contact by an ingenious device the
clock is stopped and the desired result .
is attained. The working of the clock
during a match Is simplicity Itself. At
the commencement of the match the
hands of each clock point to 12. Then
at the call of "time to commence play"
the clock of the first player is started:
then as soon as he makes his first
move lie stops his own clock either by
depressing it or by touching the arm
referred to, the same motion starting
his opponent's clock. So it goes on
during the entire course of the game,
each move being marked by the stop
ping of one clock and the starting of
the other.
COUNTERFEIT BILLS.
Tho Check Letter Test on United
States Currency.
The United States government prints
its currency and numbers its bills in a
series of four, so that every piece of
paper money turned out bears one of
the check letters— A, B, C, D. One of
these letters is always found in two
•places on a United States bill, In the
upper left hand corner and in the low
er right hand corner. The placing of
the letter on the bill is not determined
by the number of the bill. The rule is
to divide the last two figures on the
note by four. Should the remainder be
one, the check letter must be A; should
It be two, the check letter Is B; three,
the check letter Is C, and nothing, the
letter D.
For example, I have before me a
five dollar certificate. Its number Is
81489730. The terminal number is 30.
Divide by four. The result is seven
with two over. The check letter Is B.
Here is a yellow back gold certificate
with twenty-three as its terminal num
ber. Divide this by four, and we have
five with three over. C is the check
letter.
Should this rule of four fail to work
on any United States currency note
yon may bet all you have that the
money Is bad. Some counterfeited bills
are right to their check letters, but a
great many are not so if the rule of
four works. The bill may be still bad,
but if It doesn't it is surely bad. This
rule applies only to United States cur
rency and not to national bank notes.

Spain's Buried Wealth.
The Carthaginians and the Tyrlans
regarded Spain as El Dorado. It Is
but a poor country today, but potential
wealth lies in its rock bound hills, Just
as in the days of the ancients. When
those acquisitive mariners, the Phoe
nicians, first set foot in the country
they exchanged their commodities,
says Aristotle, "for such immense
quantities of silver that their ships
could neither contain nor sustain the
load, though they used it for ballast
and made their anchors and other im
plements of silver." So rich in silver
was the country then that the people
are said to have made their commonest
domestic utensils of the metal and
even their mangers. The Romans
found that their greedy forerunners
had sadly diminished the precious
store, yet enough was left to satisfy
not a few proconsuls.
