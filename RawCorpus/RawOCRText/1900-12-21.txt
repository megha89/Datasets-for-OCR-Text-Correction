had knelt to do him homage/ be called'
for his. grand secretary and said:
j» "Remshen, I'm a good deal of a fel

"AU other things are but a fly ou a

highness.". . ;"■;
"But how about the heavens. Rem
shen?" continued the akound after
chuckling his satisfaction. "I am sat
isfied that I boss the earth, even to the
mountains and rivers thereof, but I'm
not exactly clear as to the sun, moon
and stars. Don't they come under my
! rule as well?"' ■
"Dost not remember, O mighty ruler,
i that your title is Akound the Mighty,

boss of the earth and owner of all the
planets above? Your humble slave as
sures you that the sun, moon and every
star* will hustle to'do your bidding."
"Thanks, Remshen. I must. be a
daisy for sure.* Not being clear on the
subject, I haven't given much atten
tion to celestial matters, but now I
think I'll give them a whirl. If a fel
ler Is going to be boss at all, he might
as well be a boss on wheels."
. "That Is true, O akound, and when
you get ready to command the moon to
come off her perch I will issue procla
mation and gather the people.". j
': Old Remshen was a fawning syco
phant on skates. He had a good thing
and--wanted to keep It. He bad said
.' the same fulsome words to bis master
a hundred times over, but nothing bad

more solid. A day or two after the
' above conversation and.while he was
going around the palace with a molas

his master. . .'.>'• {•','.
_."By the way, Remshen, do you re

J "Can a slave forget his master's
words?" asked .Remshen as he lifted
I his hands in protest "\ I \
'■ "I've been 1 thinking. t I'm'.a heap of a
feller, and you know it, and 1 know it,

"Will it please thee to behead a thou

' "Well, yes, It would, but as it is Just
about tax time we'd better leave their
heads' on their shoulders until they

for the moon, Remshen. She'll be full
tonight, and I'll order her to come
down to earth."
' "But, O ruler, she might be damaged
In the fall," protested Remshen, begin
ning to quake with fear.
""I'll look out for that We'll spread
a feather bed for her to light on. Just
Issue a proclamation for the people to
gather on the east side of my palace at
M o'clock tonight"
"The moon, O ruler,' Is sometimes ob
stinate," suggested Remshen as he felt
a pain. "She has even been known to
disobey mighty potentates."
v 'J'Biit: she'll tumble for. me, or I'll
know the reason wliyl Is It not In my
title that I am owner of all the planets

The Eagle Got tbe Pish.
At this junction of the thoroughfare
and. lsland lake on a dead pine more
than 100 feet high sat a white headed
eagle. In the air a large fishhawk was
sailing over the water looking for his
dinner 200 or 300 feet below him.
What penetrating orbs of vision na
ture ..has endowed this bird with!
There, he gives his lightninglike shot
to the water, seems almost submerged,
only to reappear, with a four pound
pike . in his talons, j Slowly ' he rises,
going toward the woods, where x he
hopes . to enjoy his well ■ earned meal,
but he has reckoned without his host.
The king of birds has been watching
his every movement and, if found suc
cessful, is In readiness 'to exact, that
tribute which the stronger always de
mands and compels from the weak.
Almost quick as thought the-eagle Is
pursuing : the •"■ hawk, and for a little
while a merry chase it is. But the
eagle Is the -master, and the hawk In
stinctively feels It, as after a sudden,
violent swerve, only Just to evade the
terrible claws jof the now enraged
eagle, . he drops the prize and slowly
flies to the other end of the lake.
CJ There Is no need for haste' now, as
the master was after tribute, not the
hawk.' ' Payment having been made by
relinquishing valuable property, the
eagle once more displays bis wonderful
activity by catching the pike before it
strikes the water and then as leisurely
to cover to gormandize.— Forest and
Stream. <
Under "Water.
Strange acquaintances are to be
made under water. H. Phelps Whlt
uiarsh. who for a time adopted the
calling of pearl fisher In Australian
waters, tells this story of meeting a
submarine monster:
"It was a muddy day. and every
thing in consequence looked blurred
and exaggerated. In the yellowdlstance
I saw an immense dark object moving
slowly toward me. As it came nearer
I made out a central body with several
great arms," or feelers, ' waving rhyth
mically.-; >Iy. heart was In my mouth.'.
~'3felt sure it was an octopus. Then,
when I was about to stir up the mud
at my feet .to avoid being seen. I dis
covered that the enemy was nothing
more than a fellow diver. .The feelers
I had imagined were his arms, legs and
lines. . : ' " '■ '■ - ■;; -..-,
"A shadowy giant, about 12 fept
high, with huge hands and a bead like
a small barrel, was approaching. He
walked slowly, his heavy boots raising
the mud behind him like a cloud of
dust, and his great central eye gleamed
darkly. Although I knew him to be a
man. It was with difficulty that I re
frained from taking to my heels. ' At
sight of me he. too, was startled, but
he quickly recovered, and we shook
hands. Then we nodded,; grinned,
showed each other the state of our
bags' and parted." i
THE BREAD WAS AN EXTRA.
An English Cafe Charge That Sur-
prised an American.
"One of the strangest things about
the : - management of English restau
rants," remarked a gentleman who has
recently return^ from a visit to Lon
don to the writer,. "Is the custom of
charging diners for every slice of bread
'which 'they eat. For instance, a day
or two before my departure from the
British capital I, as a mark of esteem,
Invited several English friends to dine
with me at one of the most celebrated
of: the fashionable west end restau
rants. ' Well, the repast was served in
a private room, and everything went
off splendidly until the coffee and cigar
stage was reached and I asked that
my bill be brought to me. There, to
my utter astonishment, the head
waiter, in the hearing of the assem
bled company, approached me and in
a loud voice asked, 'And how many
breads. 'aye you 'ad, sir?'
"This question I could not answer,
as I had not been engaged In counting
the number of slices consumed, but
one of my guests, who had evidently
kept track of the bread, noticing my
embarrassment, said in my behalf,
'Four plates.'
" 'Ah,' muttered the waiter, that's
1 shillln hextra.' And after i adding
the amount to my bill he handed It to
me for inspection. .. ,

have been wondering ever since I did
so. why the American -custom of not
charging for 'the staff of life' is not

Ancient Origin of Military Palate.
When did the military salute come
Into use? It certainly dates from the
earlier half of the fifteenth cen
tury, says the London Chronicle. In
the "Speculum Humanee Salvatlonis,"
which was issued before the Invention
of printing by movable types, there Is
an exceedingly quaint illustration In
which Abraham Is represented as sa
luting Melchisedec. The patriarch Is
in mediaeval armor and apparently on
guard, and -it would seem that Mel
chisedec Is bringing him refreshments
of water, and the, salute Is distinctly
the military one still in use.
The Earth's Shadow.
The earth has a shadow, but few

moon. Nevertheless many of us have
nqtlced on fine, cloudless evenings In
summer, shortly before sunset, a rosy

sun, with a bluish, gray segment under
if. As fhe sun sinks the arc rises until
It attains the zenith and even passes It

ARMORED COFFINS.
They Were Once Used In a Church-
yard In Scotland.
In the earlier half of the nineteenth
century the practice of stealing bodies
from the churchyards for the purpose
of sale as subjects for dissection, which
was known as "body snatching,'.' was
for a time very rife.
Various plans were . made to defeat
the nefarious and sacrilegious proceed
ings of the "body snatchers," or "resur
rectionists," as- they were sometimes
called, a very common one being the
erection of two or more small watch
houses ' whose : windows ; commanded
the whole - burying ground, and jj In
which the - friends of „ the deceased
mounted guard for a number of nights
after the funeral. \ : %
. A usual method of the grave robbers
was to dig down to the head of the
coffin and bore In it a large round hole
by means of a specially -_ constructed
center bit It was to counteract this
maneuver that the two curious coffln
like relics now lying on either side of
the door of the ruined church of Aber
foyle, in Perthshire, ; were constructed.
They are solid masses of, cast iron of
enormous weight "iv « '■}'. -
When an interment took place one of
these massive Blabs was lowered by
suitable derricks, tackles* and chains
on to the top of the coffin, the grave
was filled in, and there it was left for
some considerable time. Later on the
grave was opened. and the Iron armor
plate was removed and laid aside
ready for another funeral.
These contrivances still lie on the
grass of the lonely little churchyard,
objects of curiosity to the passing cy
clist and tourist.— Scientific American.

Cmriama African Cntomi,
Among the human sacrifices of thje
delta of the Niger, says ; Count de
Cardi, young girls occupy the most
honored place. They are at regular
periods offered up to the gods, and In
stead of shrinking from this horrible
doom they accept it with pride and
gratitude. Nothing Is refused to these
girls while they are alive. If one of
them sees a handsome dress or orna
ment on a woman and expresses a de
lire to have it, the woman must give It
to her. - Men are also sacrificed, though
not for religious . reasons, and they
welcome' death as eagerly as the girls.
Count de Cardi once tried to save one
of these victims, but instead of thank-
Ing him, the man reviled him so bitter
ly for interfering an A scolded the by
standers so heartily for delaying to
carry - out the sentence that they
promptly stopped his mouth by killing
him.
' The worst Insult which one woman
can offer, to another Is to hold out the
right hand In front of her with the In
dex and middle finger forming the let
ter V. This means, "You will become
the mother of twins." When twins are
born in this region, they and their
mothers are killed, as a rule, and when
a mother dies in giving birth to a child
the latter is also killed and buried with
her.' It Is not superstition which im
pels, the negroes to dispose of mother
less infants In this heartless fashion,
but the great difficulty of rearing them.
Altogether, the Information which
Count de Cardi has gathered during
his residence of many years In "this
portion of Africa is of rare value, espe
cially to anthropologists.
He Remembered Them.
"By the way,'; said the man who had
stopped at a farmhouse to water his
horse,. "ls years ago a poor boy came
this way, and you took him In."
"Yes?" queried the farmer, somewhat
surprised. "• '
"You were kind to him," went on the
stranger; "you fed him, gave . him
words of encouragement and an old
suit of clothes, put a dollar hi his pock
et and sent him on his way rejoicing.
He told you at the time that be nevei
would forget your kindness. Am I
right?"
| "1 reckon you are," replied the farm
er.-
"H» said that If he prospered he
would see that you never had occasion
to regret your kindness to a poor, strug
gling lad." .
"Land's sakes!" exclaimed the farm
er's wife excitedly. "It sounds almost
like a fairy tale, don't it? Why, you
must have seen him."
"I have," said the stranger, "and he
sent a message to you."'
"What is it?' they both asked ex
pectantly.
"He told me to tell you that he la
still poor." ..
As the stranger' drove away the
fanner went out and kicked the pump
viciously, while his wife threw a roll-
Ing pin at the chickens.— New York

What They Deserved.
Not very long since an exceedingly
well dressed man about 35 was charg
ed In a north London court with being
drunk. He promptly paid bis 10 shil
lings' fine and went away. A fortnight
later a stylishly, dressed woman was
charged with a similar offense. . „• As
she gave the same name and address 1
concluded they were husband and wife.
So I called on them, and my visit was
repeated several times. They had a
very nice home, kept two servants and
had four children. I noticed a bonnj
lad of 8, as I saw him several times
Some months later I got a letter as fol

Tie Explanation.
One morning the readers of a certain
newspaper were perplexed to see in
type the announcement that "the Sco
tus handed down an Important deci
sion yesterday." The afternoon paper
of the town, with which the morning
paper for years had held a bitter con
troversy, Interesting none but them
selves, laughed that day, as the poets
say,' "In ghoulish glee," and It was up
to the morning paper the next day to
explain that "the types" made them

Mistakes In Christening.
At Ramsbury Manor, England, there
once resided a poulterer's family of the
name of Duck. The third son was to
be christened, and the mother wanted
the name to be William. Just before
starting for church the nurse ran up
stairs to the father, who was laid up
with gout, to tell, him they were off.'
"What . be ■ going .to call un, nurse?"
"Missus says It's to be William," was
the reply. "William be Mowed!" said
the Invalid. "Call un plain Bill!" In
accordance with these laconic instruc
tions the nurse gave the name of Plain
bill to the clergyman, and the Infant
was christened accordingly.
In an even funnier way Is the queer
Cbristian name of Mr. Ono Tichlner of
Peckham accounted for." .When his
parents and sponsors - arrived at the
church, his name had not been settled
upon, and whei the clergyman s said,
"Name this child," one of the friends
said "John," and another : said | "Oil,
no!" meaning not John, and, as no one
else spoke, the clergyman thought that
was to be his name and baptized him
Ono. . Tbe full account of the baptism
is contained In Blanck's "History of
Camberwell." ' ,; ; ;
A clergyman's son vouches for the
following: "My father was baptizing a
boy of 6 years of age. The names giv
en were Benjamin Joseph. After the
ceremony he said to the boy, 'You have
two very good names, and you ought
to be a good boy. How did you come
by them?" 'Please, sir,' said the boy,
'we was twins, and the other died!*" •

"You understand, of course," pursued
the lawyer, "what is meant by a 'pre

"Yes, sir," replied the man whom he
was examining with reference to his

A LITTLE KNOWN ART.
The Tobacco Flavorer Has Short
Poors and Draws Bis; Fay.
"A high grade position of which but
little is known, except to the trade,"
•bserved j a prominent tobacco manu
facturer to a Washington Star reporter,
"is what Is known as the 'flavorer,' the
man who is responsible for the flavor
)f all the grades of goods made and
r.iio sees to it that the flavor is kept
the same year in and year out. It mat
ters not where the tobacco that goes in
them comes from or the conditions tin
ier which It has grown. Of course to
bacco manufacturers endeavor tq use
the same kind of tobacco all the time,
but circumstances at times render this
Impossible,
"As an illustration, our company bad
bought up and stored away enough to
bacco to make up all our brands of
smoking tobacco and cigarettes for the
year, when all of a sudden our store
houses were destroyed by fire, and our
stock went out of existence. There
was no more tobacco of that particular
grade to be bought, and we were driv
en into new fields. The tobacco being
raised on a different soil and being
slightly different as far as seed and
Btem were concerned, the flavor was
also different. Smokers, and chewers.
as well, Insist on the same flavor all
the time. , v • ■■
"Here is where the flavorer cpmes In.
By his art and skill he can make to
bacco that 'grows on low lands taste
and smell the same as that grown on
high, lands. He can make tobacco
grown during a dry season take the
same flavor as that grown during the
rainy season. Tobaccos grown at dif
ferent ends of the same state or in dif
ferent states are by his treatment the
same, as far as the consumer Is con
cerned. He draws big money; but,
though he comes high, as the traveling
show companies say, 'we must have
them.' :
"As may be imagined, there are not
many .who are cqmpefent to do the
work; and as a result they range In
BalaVles all the way from $8 to $10 per
day of about one hour's actual work.
They are employed, however, but about
nine months in each year."

closed It. That was repeated a dozen

A SLUMBER SONG.
Hwp, my beloved. To sleep nd dream to but.
The night to us is peace, the day unreit, - '
For day, while parted, brings to us but pain;
In dreams we live tbe dear part o'er again.
, We weep not in our sleep; .
Our tears are for the day.
Which smiles, while I but weep,'
For thou art far away.
Hushed be the voices of the garish day,
Its frets and cares and Borrows swept away;
Forgotten quite the interval of yean ...
Since last we met, with all their bitter tears.
Sleep, love. To dream is best.
Our waking is but pain;
In sleep alone we rest
And live the past again.
Deep, my dear love, and be thy dreams of me!
Waking or sleeping, I still think of thee, .
But dreams make present time of all the past;
The night restores thee — would my dreams might
Dream, dear, till the day breaks '
And earthly shadows flee,
~V- ' Where morn to grief ne'er wakes '
And I be one with thee. - ■

Sleeplessness marks the very riinm-r
of human suffering. llt is only a step
removed from insanity. - When sleep no
longer restores the exhausted nature, the
struggle with disease cannot last long.
The starting point of the nervous dis-
orders which produce ill -health and
sleeplessness, is ganerally a diseased
condition of the Womanly organs. Re-
store these organs to sound health and
the appetite comes back, the day's work
no longer wearies, and sleep is sound
and refreshing. Dr. | Pierces Favorite
Prescription cures diseases of the wom-
anly organs. ■ It stops the drains which
weaken women ; it- heals the inflamma-
tion and ulceration, and cures female
weakness. .
There is no alcohol in "Favorite Pre-
scription " and it is entirely free from
opium,* cocaine and all other narcotics.
It is a temperance medicine.

WHO IS HIT?
An article in a recent issue of the Ledger brought forth
a prolonged wail from some one, which appears in last week's
-f ■• ■■-.- The Ledger did not accuse any, one of the gentlemen
-named in the Dispatch-article of malfeasance in office. The
grey cells in the cerebrumof the author cannnot have been in
an active and healthy condition when he wrote that labored art
icle, or he would have been able to see that the enumeration
~of those gentlemen, in the connection given, was an insult to
..each one of them, inasmuch as it pre-supposes the possibility
of suspicion. The Ledger has. too high an opinion of'pub
lic servants, whom the sovereign people have. honored with
positions of trust, to even intimate that any one of them could
be guilty of dishonesty in office. The article in the Dispatch
does, however, presume the possibility of such suspicion.
-For this insult to our county officials the Ledger is in
no way responsible; and we leave the author of the Dispatch
article to make his peace as best he can.
■ v~ c . The Ledger accused the Democratic party, through its
ring manipulators, with having attempted a piece of political
rtickery and usurpation in the matter of appointments by the
Board of Supervisors. The people of Amador county will no
■tice that the Dispatch-article steers clear of that subject, and
unfairly and unjustly accuses the Ledger of something it did
We all know that the attempt thus'to usurp the functions
of the incoming Board is condemned by all good citizens of
both parties. The fact is that the ring, of the personnel of
which the writer in the Dispatch seems anxious to learn,
overreached itself, arid everybody knows it.
. .. (r> The Dispatch-article puts that paper on record as opposed
• to the welcoming of outside capital to Jackson and Amador
* county. The slur cast at the gentleman who owned, up to
Dec. i, J9oo, the bulk of the stock of the LEDGER, can be in
terpreted in no other way. Mr. David Gutmann, the afore
said owner, has been the promoter and chief mover of enter
* prises that have brought from $400,000 to $600,000 into Am-
The same slur applies also to other representatives of
-foreign capital, and especially to the superintendents of the
' X)neida, Kennedy, Zeile, Bellwether, Amador Queen No. 1
and Amador Queen No. 2 mines, the capital stock of which
is mostly owned by outsiders, or "foreigners," as the Dispatch
puts it. Does the author of the article wish to shut the doors
of Amador county to foreign capital, close down these mines,
and go back to old times, when business houses in Jackson,
now worth thousands of dollars, were sold for a few hundred?
The stock of the Ledger is now owned, however, by
Jackson business men, so that his boomerang hits hardest on
' the back stroke.
The brilliant author of the Dispatch-wail will please to
bear in mind that " political trickery ". and " official dis
honesty" are not synonymous terms. The Ledger has ? no
apologies to make to the officials whose names are paraded
in the Dispatch to draw attention from the real issue. The
failure of part of the scheme was due to the sterling integrity
and general honesty of some of these estimable men.
, As to "showing up or shutting up," the Democratic
manipulators did the "showing up" on the first Monday of
the month, and' if the Dispatch wants any more of it, let it
use its influence for more resignations and give the Deino
craatic members of the old Board a chance to fill the vacancies.
The "shut-up" part is of course unworthy of notice.
" Next Tuesday the last Christmas of the nineteenth cen
tury will be celebrated. In all the larger cities of this and
other Christian nations special ; services will be held and
merry Christmas' chimes will announce the anniversary of
the birth of the Savior of mankind.
On that day the rich should remember the poor, and all,
both rich and, poor, should remember the little folks. Make
the children supremely happy for one day of the year, even if
rigid self-denial on the part of the adults is necessary in some
instances to accomplish it.
The LEDGER wishes its many readers a most enjoyable
and exceptionally- "Merry Ghristmas."
The Ledger is in favor of uniting with the other papers
of s the county for the. purpose of forming an association as
suggested by the lone Echo/ A -united effort, intelligently
and conscientiously put forth by the newspapers will result in
untold advantage to Amador county.
| Be liberal with the little ones . during the holidays.
Make them happy, and ypur efforts in that direction will en
hance your own plejisur?;

CHILDREN'S CHRISTMAS GIFTS.
Doable Pleasure Would They Bring if Shar
ed with Leu Fortunate little Ones.
"It Instead of overloading our. own
children with presents on Christmas,
we would give them less and lead them
to share some of the gifts that would
otherwise be for themselves with some
children to whom none would other
wise come, we would teach a very use
ful and needful lesson to our little ones.
The real enjoyment of any pleasure
comes from sharing it with some, one.
Pleasures which we confine to ourselves
simply make us selfish and narrow.
One of the last things which Christ did
on earth was to gather His disciples
around him and have' them partake
with him of the bounties of His table.
And in this single act He taught man
kind one of its greatest lessons. Our
children cannot be taught too early to
let others partake of their pleasures,
especially those whom circumstances
have made less fortunate in enjoying
the pleasures of the world. In this
way we shall simplify the Christmases
of our own children, which will benefit
them, and at the same time make
others happy — which is, after all, one
of the. most beautiful and satisfying
pleasures in life that we can experience.
No other feeling quite reaches it. The
happy sparkle in the eye comes from
the hand that is held out to others." —
Edward Bok in the December Ladies'
Home Journal. *

The Storm.
The wind storm that- occurred one
week ago to-day, which did so much
damage in San Francisco, hustled
things . about pretty lively in this
vicinity, but no great damage was done.
The roof of Tom Ryan's huge shed,
over the street in front of his Road
house, at Martell's Station, 60x40 feet
in size, was carefully lifted by the wind
and gently deposited intact a few rods
away. Not a shake was shaken. Two
young ladies in Jackson, while walking
on Broadway, were.lifted off their feet,
one of them being carried several feet
in the air. They were not hurt. Many
loose things about premises and several
unstable terra cotta chimneys, went
down before the blast.

an Old abandoned gravel tunnel at

some very good gravel on the rim of
the channel. On Thursday last they
struck some pillars of rich gravel, j the

has been' worked, but it is' said that a
large amount of gold was taken from
the mine when it was in operation. It
is Dr. Lee's intention to prospect the
mine in a most thorough manner, and
should it prove to be as good as report

with this great waste it averaged about
$30 to the ton. Dan Lightner, one of the
owners, was dissatisfied with thesd re
sults, knowing from his experience as a
miner and J.he* promising, surroundings
that it should yield better^ so 'he got
out five tons and sent it to San Fran
cisco to 'have it handled by proper
machinery and the result was that it
yielded $100 to the ton. The owners
were highly pleased with the result,
and consequently began to put in im
proved machinery, and in about a
month's time all will be ready to go
ahead with the work of taking out gold:
The soil is a red clay that can be easily
worked and there are great quantities
of good ground. '
Hon. W. C. Balßton, manager of .the
Melones Mining Company 'at Robinsons
Ferry, passed through San Andreas
last Tuesday morning on ' his ! way. to
San Francisco from the property of the
company. Mr. Balston is highly elated
over the results of the recent assays of
rock taken from different parts of the
mine and it is apparent from what we
learned from him that' the Melones
property, inside of two years, will be
the biggest mining proposition in the
county and one of the' largest in the
State. . The assays recently made are
highly satisfactory to Mr. Balston and
all interested in the property. From
the east vein of the Carolina 155 assays
were made, each sample taken being 5
feet wide for a distance of 25 feet ■ over
crosscuts 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, ' and the
assays show an average value of $3.36
to the ton. From surveys made in this
section of the property there are 1,424,
000 tons of the same grade of ore in
sight, making a gross value of ' $4,765,
000.' This does not include high assays
nor crosscut. No. 1 north nor shaft.
The total amount of ore between the
South Carolina and -tunnel. No. 3, to
gether with the balance between cross
cuts Nos. 7 and 8 and the north end of
the mine is 2,262,000 tons by actual
surveys made. The gross value of the
ore at $3.36 per ton is $8,809,920, and
after milling expenses are deducted the
net value will be $3,000,060 at least.
There is enough rock now in sight: to
keep the 120-stamp mill running twelve
TUOLUMNE COUNTY
. New Era: Work on the Barry was
resumed last Tuesday morning.
Blair, Holland and Doming are doing
the assessment work on the Standard.
Sinking has been resumed from; the
900 foot level of the Providence shaft.
At the 400 foot level of the Dreisatn a
i blind shoot of very rich ore has been
| struck in the west crosscut. Those
» i who have seen the shoot say it is the
true Yellow Jacket.
The Laurel in a day changed from a
common . every-day claim into what
promises to be one of the greatest
bonanzas in California. In the east
crosscut at the 200 foot level a strong
shoot of ore was discovered which will
mill clear across over $30 per ton, be
side carrying a heavy per-centage of
high grade sulphurets. Although the
vein is now big enough to grind out
- gold and plenty of it quickly the fissure
pe*sur«a 13 feet from wall to wall,
The Laurel can now be honestly ranked
as one of the best mines in the county.'

Quito awhile ago the Du (field was
bonded ?i> the North Trinity Company
for $15,000. 'B.'Shellito arrived from
the East,' put on a force of men, and
after four month's work threw the
mine up, condemned it as no good, and
so reported l to the company. * Before
leaving, Geo.' Bartlett Jr., and E.. W.
Wbitlock, who had worked in the
Duffield,' purchased one dump ' contain
ing 14 tons of rock of Shelllto for $25.
The rock, has just been put through
the Dreisam mill,' returning $354 in
free gold and $25 ■in sulphurets. And
thus was a great claim given up
through'"* ignorance. The mine j| is
owned by'theScainavino Bros., J. H.
West and G. Rolleri.
Good Idea.
The following from the lone "Echo"
of last week is worthy "of careful'con
sideration by the newspaper makers of
Amador county:
1 'SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. "
1 'The newspaper publishers Of Ama
dor county should form themselves
into a county association and secure
the benefits for their county of a united
effort, and efforts put forth after
mature deliberation upon the subjects
to be handled.- In union there is
strength, but there can be no union
while the various papers in the county
are working at cross purposes;*.'.
••■ '.'The ,editHrs- v JOf> the papers in the
county should meet and discuss the
varied resources of the county and the
best way of .bringing them to the at
tention of home-seekers from abroad.
Such united and' intelligent efforts must
of necessity, and would, | have a great
influence for aiding in the advance
ment of the interests of Amador
county."
"The "Echo" suggests to the other
newspapers of the county that the pub
lishers meet at an early date to discuss
plans for co-operation along the lines
suggested."' . =-!--V~
'•The press of this county should
work together for the advertising of

"Please Bemit."
The two words that constitute the
heading of this item are probably used
oftener in commercial circles than most
of us are aware of. These words are
not formidable in themselves,' but they
mean much. _' They mean in fact:
"Please scrape together the amount
you owe me, for I must scrape together
the amount I owe somebody else, and
if you will do your duty I can do mine. ' '
As announced in the Ledger of - last
week, the paper has changed hands
and is now owned .solely by ' Jackson
businessmen, who urge the collection
of all outstanding subscription ac
counts. . We, therefore, say to one and
all, in the kindliest manner possible,
"please remit." ■ ■
Please bear in mind that if you owe
from $2.50 to $7.50 hundreds of others
owe the same and the aggregate
amounts to many hundreds of dollars
which the Ledger has earned . and is
entitled to and needs just now. Can
you not and will you not favor us with
a 'remittance at once?

I'HE A^rAT>OlV £EDGOEH: JACKSON, eALIFOfoNTA. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 21, ; 1900.
CHOSEN FRIENDS.
California Members Propose to Continue In-
dependent of Rational Order.
The telegram published in Mon
day's "Chronicle" telling that the fra
ternal * insurance ' Order of Chosen
Friends had been declared insolvent
and that the appointment of a receiver
had been demanded, has brought con
sternation to this - State, . the strong
hold of the order. ' Out of a total mem
bership of between 21,000 and 22,000 in
the entire United States. California
lays claim to 5131 members. There are
sixteen councils in San Francisco and
116 in the State at large/ including men
and. women, of excellent standing.
Telepraphic advices attribute the fi
nancial embarrassment to heavy death
claims resulting from the Galveston
flood,' , aggregating some $60,000,
coupled with a loss of $30,000 incurred
through a defaulting supreme treas
urer.' . ■ |pS v-" ■- |
Cyros M. Arnold, financial agent of
the order in California - for several
years past, last night made the follow
ing statement: i
The announcement of the insolvency
of the Order of Chosen Friends has
come upon us here in California like - a
thunder-bolt out of a clear sky. Up to
the time of reading* the ''Chronicle's"
dispatch we had received no intimation
whatever that the financial condition
of the order was not, perfectly, sound.
None, of us is yet i^.recelpt of "any per
sonal dispatches, and it is of course not
yet time for a letter to . arrive. , We
can only wait until we have full infor
mation, and meantime suspend the col
lection of dues. Nothing more . clearly
demonstrates our complete ignorance
of this impending calamity than the
fact that our grand . recorder, S. C.
Wallis, is at this moment on his way to
Portland, Or., where he was to organize
a council, intending to continue his
journey on to Washington, where there
were several councils ready for organi
zation. He will at once return .to San
Francisco. ;
Our order has undoubtedly under
taken too much, for, unlike any other
fraternal organization of its sort, it has
not only paid a death insurance amount
ing to over $15,000,000 since its organi
zation some twenty years ago,, but it
has also paid out over $1,000,000 in | the
way of old age and disability benefits.
We believed the principle upon which
it was conducted to be sound financially,
based on a careful study of the mortali
ty tables of the insurance companies,
and calculated to extend the utmost
possible protection to members, . while
squarely and honestly administered.
If the figures quoted in the paper -are
correct I do not think they justify." the
insolvency of the ' order. It would' be
an easy matter to levy a special assess
ment to cover a deficit of $60,000, for
that would mean a special tax, which
would be cheerfully met. ' '
What will we do here in California if
this insolvency case Is urged? I can as
sure you that we shall act with energy
and decision. The executive committee
of our Grand Council will hold a meet
ing, probably next Monday, and we
shall do all we can to stop, this.: action
and to insist upon meeting the deficit,
if deficit there be^ Failing to effect
this, if the worst comes to worst and
the'order disbands, we shall see that
the interests of California members are
fully protected. Our funds are usually
forwarded East, as a matter of form,
although we always draw upon local
banks when payments are to be made.
As we have no sinking fund, the
amount of money on hand to the credit
of the national organization is never
very large, rarely exceeding $15,000 or
thereabouts. There is no reason in the
world why, if the Eastern councils pre
fer to disband, we should not continue
our existence as an independent or
ganization. Many of our members are
too, old to enter , any other fraternal
body. ' . It is to our Interest to hold to
gether, and we 'propose* to do so.
There will be no widows or orphans en
titled to benefits in California, . whose
claims will not be promptly met and
paid In full, and I can see no reason
why we should not continue our ex
istence as a local body, and enjoy' the
same benefits and advantages we have
under national organization.

fornia," by W. H. Storms, says the
"Pacific Coast Miner," is the title of
the interesting bulletin, j Number 18,

Bureau and now in the hands of the
State Printer. It is the result of several
months of field labor by Mr. Storms,
as bureau assistant, and will make a
pamphlet of about 150 pages, with
thirty-seven illustrations. It will be a
valuable contribution to the literature
of California mining, and the author is
one widely known to be thoroughly
competent for the task. . .

A Sample of What a Fairly Health)
Cockatoo Can Do.
A light chain securely fastened on
the cockatoo's leg promised safety, but
he contrived to get within reach of mj
new curtains and rapidly devoured
some half yard or so of a hand painted
border, which was the pride of my
heart Then came an interval of calm
and exemplary Ijehavior which lulled
me into a false security. Cockle seemed
to have but one object- In life, which
was to pull out all his own feathers,
and by evening the dining room often
looked as though a white fowl bad
been plucked in it.
I consulted a bird doctor, but a*
Cockle's health was perfectly good and
his diet all that could be recommended,
It was supposed he only plucked himself
-for want of occupation, and firewood
was recommended as a substitute.
This answered very well, and he spent
his leisure in gnawing sticks of deal
only when no one chanced to be In the
room he used to unfasten the swivel
of his chain, leave it dangling on the
stand 'and descend in search of his
playthings. When the fire had not
been lighted, I often found half the
coals pulled out of the grate and the
firewood .in splinters. At last, with
warmer weather, both coals and wood
were removed, so the next time Mastei
Cockle found himself short of a job he
set to work on the dining room chairs,
first pulled out all their bright nails
and next tore holes in the leather,
through ' which he triumphantly
dragged the stuffing.
■ . At one time he went on a visit fot
some weeks and ate up everything
within his reach In that friendly estab
lishment. His "bag" for one afternoon
consisted of a venerable fern and a
large palm, some library books, news
papers,' a pack of cards and an arm
chair. And yet every one adores him,
and he Is the spoiled child of more than
oneiamily.-Cornhill.
Dangerous Etiquette.
I Old world privilege and restriction
reign supreme In Spain, where there Is
a law that no subject shall touch the
person of the king or queen.
- Alfonso XIII nearly suffered a se
vere fall from" this rule In his child
hood. An aunt of his made him a pres
ent of a swing. When he used it for
the first time, the motion frightened
him, and he began to cry, whereupon a
lackey .lifted him quietly out of it and
60, no doubt preserved him from fall-
Ing.
The breach of . etiquette, however,
was flagrant and dreadful. The queen
was obliged to punish it by dismissing
the man from his post At the same
time. she showed her real feelings on
the subject by appointing him imme
diately to another and better place in
the royal household.
j In. another case a queen of Spain
' nearly lost her life in a dreadful way
owing to this peculiar rule. She had
been thrown when out riding, and, her
foot catching in the stirrup, she was
dragged. Her escort would not risk
interference, and she would have been
dashed to pieces but for the heroic In
' terposition of a young man who stop
ped the horse and released her from
her dangerous position.
As* soon as they saw she was safe
her escort turned to arrest the traitor
who 'had dared to touch the queen's
— foot, but he was not to be seen. Know-
Ing well the penalty he had Incurred
he made off at once, fled for his life
and did not stop until he had crossed
the frontier. s
Lost Hat Stories.
The London Globe has been collect
ing a series of lost hat stories, of wbicfc
the following are specimens: ,'i|;^
.'A 'father .and son were standing at
the entrance to Old Chain pier at
Brighton when . the dear little boy
tumbled into the dancing waves. A
bystander, accoutered as he was.
plunged into the sea and, buffeting the
waves with lusty sinews, succeeded at
last in setting the dripping child at his
father's feet, "And what hae ye dom
wl' his hat?" said papa.
A correspondent sent the following
narrative: A festive bluejacket was
seen from a ship in Malta harbor danc
ing on the top of the parapet wall at
Fort Rlcasolf First his hat blew over,
and then, leaning over to look for it
he lost his balance and fell after it— a
sheer drop of 30 feet or more. The
surgeon on duty was landed with a
party to bring off the remains foi
identification. They found them crawl-
Ing about on hands and knees and in
quired if he was seriously hurt "Hurt
be blowed!" was his reply.' "Where's
my hat?" j '
Only a Misunderstanding.
Several years ago, in a well knowi
wholesale bouse in a big manufactur
ing town, an old bachelor bookkeeper,
■ who had . been . many years with the
firm, suddenly announced that he was
to be married.
The partners gave him a week's noli
day, and his fellow clerks raised s
little purse and presented it to pay the
expenses of his wedding trip.
, A couple of days after the wedding
one of the members of the firm .weni
down to a 'seaside resort, and there
lounging about the parade ~ and ap
parently enjoying himself Immensely,
he saw his recently married old book
keeper, but alone.
"Where's your wife?" asked the prln
cipal.
"She's at home," was the reply.
"But I thought you had money giver
you for a wedding trip?"
•C-f v"So I had," was the reply, "but 1
didn't understand that it was intended
to Include her."— Pearson's Weekly.
She Rode Free.
A woman who had come out of the
west, where she had been a cow, girl on
a ranch, was boarding a car In this
city recently." She had just placed her
foot upon the step and was preparing
to take another step to the upper plat
form when, with a furious "Step live
ly!" the conductor pulled the strap.
The car Jerked forward, and the west
ern woman swayed back for a minute,
then just caught herself In time to pre
vent a bad fall upon the cobbles.
She confronted the conductor with
angry eyes— eyes that had looked vA
dismayed Into those of mighty horned
monsters of the prairies. '
"What do you mean by starting the
car before I was on It?" she asked.
"Can't wait all day for you, lady,"
the conductor snarled. "Just step In
side there."
In a moment J the western woman,
with a backward golf sweep of the
arm, lunged for the conductor's head.
He dodged. . The blow sent his lial
spinning back into the track. The
woman entered the car and sat down.
She was flushed, but dignified. While
the other women passengers were rath
er startled, they all knew just how she
felt. Then the car stopped, while the
conductor went back for his hat The
western woman rode free that time.—

Hew Tork's Slavenhlp.
When New York city owned a slave
ship is told In an article In Pearson's
Magazine. \ The greatest impetus was
given to the slave trade by the act of
parliament of IGB4, which legalized
slavery In the North American colo
nies. This does not mean that slavery
was unknown in what is now the
United States before that time, be
cause as early as 1620 a Dutch man-of
war landed and sold 20 African ne
groes at Jamestown, Va.
In 1026 the .West India company im
ported slaves from the West Indies to
New York city, then New Amsterdam.
The city itself owned shares in a slave
ship, advanced money for its fitting
out and shared in the profits of its
royages. This recognition and encour
agement may account for the astound
ing fact that in x 750 slaves formed
one-sixth of the entire population of
New York. The general prevalence of
slavery is shown by the fact that at
this time there were 67 slaves in New
York's small suburb of Brooklyn, and
that In London Itself there were resi
dent 20,000 slaves.
Slaves were at that time publicly
dealt In on the London exchange. No
wonder the traffic In human flesh was
a recoenlzed commerce, and that in
1771 the English alone sent to Africa
102 ships equipped for the trade and
with a carrying capacity of 47,146
slaves per trip.
A Tricky Doc.
Not long ago a very fat spaniel was
introduced into the house where a fox
terrier had . always ' been the master.
The latter was told, however, to be
have well to the newcomer and not to
bully him. So the two seemed fairly
friendly and In the end got In the habit
of taking short rambles together.
However, the fox terrier was evident
ly of a thoughtful disposition and on
one occasion came across a bank, or
wall, which was easy enough to leap
off, but there was greater difficulty in
returning. The - fox terrier sprang
down the bank and enticed his heavy
companion to follow, with the result
that the latter could not get back, while
the former, by reason of his greater ac
tivity, was easily able to do.
Now the terrier saw his opportunity,
returned home and cruelly left his com
panion lamenting. Never did the for
mer seem happier ' or gayer than on
that day when he had once more the
sole run of the bouse, and he sulked
when later on the spaniel had been
found, assisted up the wall and brought
home. *
Since then the fox terrier has repeat
edly got the spaniel down the same
place, with the usual result, and seems
to glory in bis mischievous act Wheth
er the "fat dog" will learn to avoid
temptation to such a ramble remains to
be seen.— Buffalo News.

How "David llarnm" Came to Be
■ • Written.
An interesting little anecdote Is told
about how "David Harum" came to be
written. , It is rather pathetic. It seems
that Mr. Wescott, the author, was the
kind of man who could do pretty much
anything— paint a picture, plan a bouse
or compose a sonata— but he bad never
made much money, so when he became
ill and realized that he might not live
long and would leave his family with
little or no money he was desperate.
"Write a book," suggested a friend
and neighbor to him one day j when
they were talking over the situation.
"I did make an attempt at it once."
answered Mr. Wescott "I tried a love
story, but I couldn't make It go."
' "Add a little local color to It" said
the first speaker. "Take one of the
people about j here that you know and
work him up— old • — , for Instance,"
mentioning a character familiar to
them both. "He'd be first rate."
; "That's a good idea!" exclaimed Mr.
'Wescott, and the result of this conver
sation was "David Harum," and yet
"David" was never In the story at all
as it was first conceived.— Anna Went
worth in Woman's Home Companion.
Belaying His Jaws.
Shark stories, with some reason, are
commonly received with Incredulity. A
well authenticated anecdote, however,
Is told of Dr. Frederic Hill, an English
surgeon of distinction.
; A man fell overboard in the Indian
ocean and almost into a shark's mouth.
Hill, who was standing close to the
rail, grabbed a belaying pin and with
out hesitation jumped to save the

DOG AND PUPPY CRATES.
Made For the Convenient Transpor-
tation of These Animals.
The dog that is shipped by express is
likely to travel In these days not only
In safety, but also In comfort. There
are various kinds of dog crates made
especially for such use, some of them
flat topped and some of those of later
design gable topped and some oval
topped, so that nothing can be placed
on top of them. Dog crates are made
In various sizes as, well as styles, some
with open, slatted sides and ends, some
closed all around, except for the open
spaces left for ventilation. Crates for
bulldogs and dogs that gnaw are made
with slats that, whether separated or
set dose together, are Iron bound, so
that the dogs can't set their teeth In
the edges.
The dog crate is provided with a cup
for water which Is so constructed that
the water can't spill out of it, and this
cup Is secured in 'the crate under the
end of a pipe to which there is an open-
Ing in the top of the" crate through
which the dog can be kept supplied
without opening the crate at all. At
tached to the front of the crate is the
dog's buffet, like a long canvas wallet
or envelope. In which the dog's food
Is carried. The dog crate has at the
ends handles by which It can be picked
up and carried as a trunk would be.
Besides these various sizes and styles
of dog crates there are also made in
various sizes smaller, lighter crates for
puppies, and crates of one sort and an
other of special sizes are made to "or
der.
First and last there are sold a good
many dog and puppy crates, and they
are regular articles of stock where dog
supplies are sold.— New York Sun.
••Jrormn" and Liberty.
In an air in the opera of "Nonna"
the theatrical censor went bo far as to
cancel the word "liberta" (liberty) and
substitute for it the word "lealta"
(loyalty). • * • Signor Ronconi, tht
famous baritone and a great public fa
vorite, having, In the ardor of his role,
forgotten the above mentioned emenda
tion, was imprisoned for three days in
order to refresh his memory.
Not long after, singing the line in the
"Ellslr d'Amore" describing how a
peasant enlisted, "Vende la liberta, si
fe soldato" (He sold his liberty to be a
soldier), he waggishly altered It to
"Vende la lealta, si fe soldato." This
variation in the text was received with
lively applause by the public, who al
ways warmly welcomed anything thai
savored of political opposition.
The next day the poor singer was
summoned by the head of the police tc
receive a reprimand for having said
that "loyalty could be sold," to which
Ronconi replied by observing that a
few days before he had been taught In
a way he was not likely to forget that
"lealta" ought always to be substitut
ed for "liberta."— Pietro Orel's "Mod
ern Italy."
The First Early Evening Paper.
The plan of this Paper not being
generally known, the Proprietors most
respectfully take the Liberty of sub
mitting the following Sketch of It to
the perusal of the Public.
The Noon Gazette will be regularly
published every day at Twelve o'Clocb
and will contain all the actual news of
the Nine Morning Papers, cautiously
and faithfully selected from them. • Ev
ery Species of Misinformation and Un
truth will be guarded against with the
utmost care, and the Communication
of real authenticated Intelligence only
will ever be the grand Object of this
Print. .
Besides the Advantage of having ali
the News of the Nine Morning Papers
comprized In one, the Noon Gazette
will contain a Postscript with every
Article of important Intelligence that
may arise on the Morning of Its publi
cation, so that as well as a" universal
Morning Paper, this Print will be
found little, if at all, inferior to any
Evening Publication.— From The Noon
Gazette and Daily Register, 1780.
Some, Ink and a Shirt.
I once retnouber having a noted Lon
don doctor out at sea for a little ama
teur fishing. He would like to see a
lollgo cuttle caught, he said. I warned
him of what'was likely to happen when
gaffing was on, but he did not care.
"Surely," he said, "I can dodge such
guesswork as this must be for so short
a time."
I felt dubious as to the result, seeing
his white shirt was a prominent object
through his having such an open vest
Finally a cuttle took the bait, and as I
drew it toward us the doctor lost all
thought of himself and his adornments
in his admiration of the movements
and the beautiful eyes of the creature
when in an instant as I gaffed it the
whole Ink charge struck him in the
throat and sadly blackened his white
habiliments.— Contemporary Review. ■
C*>stly Violins. .
The current value of Stradivarius
violins in London Is said to range f rorc
£80 to £800. In Stradivarius' own timt
one Cervetto of London received a con
signment of the master's instruments
which be was commissioned to sell foi
£4 apiece. But he was obliged to send
them back, as no Englishman at that
time would buy them at any such fig
ure. Stradivarius himself is said to
have asked a price of 4 louia dor foi
each of his violins.
Her Prospects Good. ■
"Do you think he can support you in
good style after you are married, dear'
I hear he Is worth nothing."
"I know Harold isn't rich, mamma,
but he has his life Insured for $20,000,
and I could get along quite comforta
bly on that"— Chicago Tribune.
Giving Them the Slip.
An Impecunious man In Kansas Cltj
practically lives on bananas. . When he
eats them, he throws the peels just
outside his office door. That's the way
he gives his creditors the slip.— Kansas
City Star."
The Word "Salary."
The way languages are built up li
very Interesting, and the derivation ol
the word "salary" is curious as well
In ancient times Roman soldiers re
ceived a dally portion of salt as part
of their pay. "Sal" is the Latin foi
salt, and when the salt was In course
of time commuted for .money the
amount was called salarium, or sail
money; hence our word "salary" and
hence, doubtless, the expression "not
worth his salt"— that Is, not worth hli
"salt money," or salary.

dnced to Miss Blnks Is a freethinker."

"Hosed H?in"oiit,«~
In "The Argonauts of California"
Mr. C. W. HasElns tells a good story
of sauerkraut. In one of the mining
districts near Sacramento a storekeep
er .received a barrel of .provisions
which seemed to be spoiled, to Judge
by. the smell. Instead of throwing it
away, he thrust it Into one corner of
a shed, where waste and rubbish were
piled upon it.
One day a burly, dust covered Dutch
man entered the store.
"I vants me some dot," pointing to
ward the shed. :: • .. ..;-,. -
"What is dot?" inquired the store
keeper.".
"I shows you," said the miner. "You
shnst come mit me." And to the shed
they went, where, pointing to the rub
bish heap, the Dutchman explained,
"Some of dot in dere vas vat I vants."
Boxes and barrels were removed,
and the condemned barrel was expos
ed. But when the miner eagerly point
ed to it the. trader told him it was
spoiled meat, not fit to eat
"I knows better as dot," said the
Dutchman. "You bust him in.und I
shows you."
An ax ' was brought and the barrel
"busted in," when, Instead of spoiled
meat, there was revealed some good,
old fashioned sauerkraut, made in Hol
land and shipped around Cape Horn.'
"1 , knows it," said j the delighted
miner. "I nose him out!" i
The sauerkraut sold readily at a dol
lar a pound and .was In great demand.'
The Dutch miners heard of Mt and
walked 10 and 15 miles to get a taste
of the dainty. ;, ._./. -
A Slaver's Cargo.
; From the time we first got on board
the slaver, says J. Taylor Wood in The
Atlantic, had we heard moans, cries
and rumblings coming from below, and
as soon as the captain and crew were
removed the hatches had been taken
of, when there arose a hot blast as
from a charnel house, sickening and
overpowering. In the hold were 300
human beings, gasping, struggling for
breath, dying, their bodies, limbs and
faces all expressing terrible suffering.
In their agonizing fight for life some
had torn or wounded themselves or
their neighbors dreadfully; some were
stiffened in the most unnatural posi
tions.
As soon as I knew the condition of
things I sent the boat back for the doc
tor and some whisky. He returned,,
bringing also the captain, and for, an
hour or more we were all hard at work
lifting and helping the poor creatures
on deck, where they were laid, out in
rows. A little water and stimulant re
vived most of them. * Some, however,
were dead or too far gone to be resusci
tated. The doctor worked earnestly
over each one. but 17 were beyond hu
man skill. As fast as he pronounced
them dead they were quickly dropped
overboard.
The "King of Rome."
What beenme of Napoleon's son is a
question often asked, as little mention
Is made in history of the young prince,
the desire of his father's life, who was
born March 20, 1811, amid great rejoic
ing in Paris and balled as the "king of
Rome." In January, ISI4, Napoleon
embraced his wife and child for the
last . time, and this really ended the
reign of the little king "who never saw
his kingdom." He was reared in the
Austrian court under the name of Duke
of Reichstadt and grew to be a hand
some young fellow and quite a brilliant
scholar. He had one short year of mil
itary life and then contracted pulmo
nary disease, from which he died in' his
twenty-second year. He worshiped
the memory of his father and always
spent the anniversary of his death, Ju
ly 22, In his own rooms. He is buried
in the Carthusian monastery of Vien
na, which is the Austrian Westminster
abbey.
A Jolly Funeral.
An Italian doctor»named Louis Cor
tusio, who died In the eighteenth cen
tury, left some curious Instructions as
to the manner of his burial. This gen
tleman, by his will, forbade his rela
tions to weep at his funeral on pain of
being disinherited and appointed him
or her who should laugh the longest
and loudest the principal heir and leg
atee. Not a stitch of black was to be
displayed either in the house in which
he should die or In the church In which
he should be buried. They were both
to be strewn with flowers and green
boughs- on the day of his funeral, j In
stead of the tolling of bells lively mu
sic was to accompany his body to the
church, and 50 minstrels were to march
with the clergy sounding their flutes,
trombones and trumpets. The bier
was to be carried by 12 marriageable
girls clothed in green, to each of whom
the testator bequeathed a sum of mon
ey for her dowry*-. Lastly, no one In
the procession was to wear black. All
these orders were absolutely carried
into effect— Household Words.
Straw Hornesnoes.
. Straw is put to strange uses in Ja
pan. Most of the horses are shod with
straw. Even the clumsiest of cart
horses wear straw shoes. »In their
case the shoes are tied around the
ankles with straw rope and are made
of the ordinary rice straw, braided. so
that they form a sole for the foot about
half an Inch thick. These soles cost
about a half penny per pair, and when
they are worn out they are thrown
away. Every cart has a stock of fresh
new shoes tied to the horse or to the
front of the cart, and in Japan it was
forjnerly the custom to measure dis
tance largely by the number of horse
shoes It took to cover the distance. So
many horseshoes made a day's Jour
ney, and the average shoe lasted for
about eight miles of travel.
Crowing; Matches.
The Belgian artisan spends his lei
sure In a very curious manner. He
keeps a special cock for crowing, and
the bird which can outcrow Its fellows
has reached the highest pinnacle of
perfection. The mode of operation Is
to place the cages containing the roost
ers In long rows, for It appears that
one bird sets the other off crowing. A
marker appointed by the organizers of
the show Is told off for each bird, his
duty being to note carefully the num
ber of crows for which it Is responsible
in the same fashion as the laps are re
corded in a bicycle race. The custom
ary duration of the match is one hour,
the winner being the bird which scores
the highest number of crows In the al
lotted time. A great number of these
competitions have taken place In the
Liege district, and in some cases heavy
bets have been made on the result

"Beg pardon," said the rude young
man, gathering his features together

MAGIC AMULETS.
Thought to Bring Good Luck to
Their Chinese Owners..
It Is the desire of. every Chinaman's
heart to possess a pair of magic brace
lets. Arm rings or bracelets j are
thought a great deal of In the Celestial
empire, the custom of wearing them
having been handed down from time
Immemorial: Usually made of Jade
stone, the Chinese arm ring of today
is of one Invariable shape. It looks
like a large martingale.
The Chinese word for Jade Is ngook
seu and for Jade arm ring or bracelet
ngook-ak. The custom In China is to
place the bracelet on a young man's
arm Just before the hand stops grow
ing. A tight fit Is usually secured, and
once placed ■ the amulet arm ring is
worn throughout life. At death, if the
bracelet has proved a lucky one and
If there is a son whom It will fit, the
bones In the old man's hand are bro
ken and the bracelet removed.
Many are the marvelous tales told
by the Chinese of the wonderful quali
ties these amulets possess. There is a
tradition that a certain Chinese em
peror who was stricken with paraly
sis wore upon his forearm a magic
bracelet, which kept life In that mem
ber for many months and allowed him
to make known his desires and decrees
by writing. At last, when death
claimed the ' emperor, ' something even
more wonderful took place. Dead three
days and lying in state, his body was
being viewed by the priests. The ad
visability of removing the bracelet was
being considered, when the band was
lifted up and gave a signal which they
Interpreted to mean .the .bracelet
should go with its owner to the tomb.
Among other wonderful properties a
good amulet Is said to act as a fairly
reliable barometer. — Cincinnati En

Spoiling- s. Sermon.
I have had some printer experience,
or, rather, Experience with printers,
which makes me fear that the "imp

for abandoning the craft and becoming

preach on the Old Testament charac

the dally papers got It, '"Nabob and
Abihu." Shades of Gutenberg!
My first Sunday morning - sermon
after I came home from my vacation
was on "Suppressed Lives," but one
of the papers announced It as - "Sup
pressed Livers." Such a thing as that
is wearing and tends to make life not
worth living, especially if, as Is said,
the worth of life depends on the liver.
