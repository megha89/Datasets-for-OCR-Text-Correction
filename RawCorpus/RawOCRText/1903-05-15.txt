ILL NATURED BRUTES.
Endurance and Carrying; Poorer thp
Only Good Traits In Cniuels.
As we have racers nnd cart horses,
so the Arabs nnd the natives of north
eastern Africa have breeds of camels
severally adapted for riding and for
carrying burdens. It is to the fast rid
ing and racing camels that the name
dromedary aloue applies, so that this
term— the (Jreek equivalent of "racer"
"•—lndicates merely a breed and not n
particular species.
All the camels of Arabia and Africa,
as well as those employed In India, be
long to the . single 3 humped species,
which is a lightly built and long limbed
animal In comparison with Its double
bnmped relative, the Bactrian camel of
central Asia. Not improbably some of
the herds of the latter species which
are found In the neighborhood of th»>
Gobi desert are the descendants of
aboriginally wild animals, but the
Arabian camel Is quite unknown In n
Wild state, and we are eveu ignorant
of Its birthplace, although it Is quite
likely that this may have been north
Africa or the neighborhood of the Ara
blan desert. For traversing tleseri
tracts camels are absolutely Indispen
sable. Their broad cusuionlike boofs
proclaim them essentially animals 0/
the desert, nnd a camel Is absolutely
helpless ou m wet and slippery Inclined
road.
• As if conscious that man cannot do
without them, camels are some of the
worst tempered and ill natured brutes
In creation, and, save for their en
durance and the heavy loads they can
carry, no oue has a good word to say
In their favor. If a camel can bite a
mounted traveler whom he niay be
passing in a narrow road, lie will never
fail to avail himself of the opportunity,
and the bubbling noise made by a
"mast"' camel at night will destroy the
rest of au entire camp.— London Illus

AN INDIAN'S TEST.
Bott He Discovered That s. White
Ma.ll Was a Coward.
"The Indian has a queer way of de
termining whether or not a man is
game, Judging from an experience I
had some years ago," said a man who
once made an educational tour of the
west, "and the same little experience
convinced me that the Indian's system
of reasoning along this line is by no
means a bad one.
"Stories had been told which brought
about a clash between the Indian and
a white man. Tln» two men originally
had nothing against each other. The
Indian had a bad reputation— that is,
he had the reputation of being a bad
man, a desperate, dangerous fellow,
who would fight a buzzsaw at the drop
of a hat.' The white man who blew
Into the section had in some way
Coined a similar reputation. He was
said to be a dangerous character and a
mon who had never been whipped. We
concluded that we would have some
fun. We met the Indian and told him
a long story about bis new rival and
reminded him that his laurels were In
danger and succeeded in getting bin
pride stirred, and his Indian blood was
soon up to the fighting point. Soou
after tills we met the white man, and
we filled him up with the same kind
of talk. He said he would take care of
the Indian all right In due time, and.
in short, would make him take to the
woods. Shortly we met the Indian
again and told him the desperate white
man wns after his scalp. He smiled
and shook his bead.
"A few days later we were talking
to the white man when the Indian
Came tip to Join the group. He had
spotted the stranger and knew him by
sight. Without saying a word to him
he walked up within arm's reach and
struck the white man In the face with
a rough, heavy glove. lie paused for a
few seconds nnd hit him again. 'Ughf
he exclaimed as he wheeled around
anil walked away. The white man
looked at the Indian In amazement, but
made no show of resentment. Later in
the day when we asked the Indian
why It was that he did not follow up
the insult with blows he told us the
white man was a coward. In explain
ing how he knew It he said' the man's
"Jaw dropped' when he struck him In
the face the second time with the glove
and that this, with the Indian, was an
unfailing sign of cowardice."— New Or
leans Times-Democrat
How Mussels Move,
The general Impression Is that mus
sels do not move. They fasten them
selves to certain objects or they lie In
the mud aud sand at the bottom of the
watet, and there they pass their exist*
enee. In proof of this the fact Is ad
duced that mussels are at times burled
under the sandy deposit when a rush
of water carries a lot of soil with it. A
naturalist who has devoted much time
to the study of these creatures says,
that mussels do move slowly, and the
movement Is accomplished in the fol
lowing manner:
The mussel opens Its shell and pro
jects its body to a certain extent from
Its projecting case. Then it exerts some
force whereby It keeps the shell above
the soil and uses Its body to propel it
self along the bottom Just in the same
way as a land snake gets over the
ground. If the sand is examined after
the mussel has taken one of these
strolls, Jt will be easy to see two paral
lel lines caused by the edges of the
shell touching the ground.

SOME QUEER NAMES.
MAINE'S COAST ISLANDS AND THEIR
PECULIAR DESIGNATIONS.
T«e Aalmal Kingdom, Uonsehold
Articles and Shipping- Terms Fl*
■r» Conspicuously, and His Satanlo
Majesty ii s jjotj ot Forgotten.
It would be almost impossible to enu
merate the names of Islands along the
cosat of Maine. They cover almost ev
ery, article of household use, as well
ns gear pertaining to vessels. The ani
mal kingdom figures conspicuously as
well as his Satanic Majesty. Just how
the names were derived no one seems
to Ibe able to determine. Some were
na'.ned for early inhabitants squatting
thereon and getting a living from the
sea| others from Incidents that have
taken place to sailors and fishermen
Who have been their visitors.
' t F.-itlierford's island was named from
the first minister who established a
parish in Bristol, and owing to his sal
ary, which was In arrears, the town
gave him a title to the entire island.
Heron Island was up to recent years
the home of a vast number of these
birds, which came annually and made
their nests in the top of the tall pines
and spruces which lined the shores.
Ram Island was once the home of a
fighting buck which disputed the right
of any one to land there. Flshhawk
island was once the favorite resting
place of these keen eyed foragers of
the sea.
Devil's Limb, Devil's Rock and Dev
il's Elbow represent the head fireman
of the lower regions. Hog island was
onco inhabited by a thrifty number of
these domestic adjuncts, which ran
wild and lived on the snakes and mice,
which were plentiful. Mouse Island
was once Infested by these rodents, as
are most of the other islands. They are
a wood species and do uot trouble hu
man habitations. Just where they came
from no one knows. They are found
on islands far out from the shore.
Squirrel island was once the home of
a large colony of gray squirrels which
came down to the seashore every seven
years from the inland woods. Red
squirrels are found on most of the is
lands and are not desirable residents,
for they prefer to nest In unoccupied
cottages.
Haddock Island was so named from
this useful little fish, which are caught
lv large quantities about its shores.
Old Man and Old Woman were named
by the fishermen from a supposed re
semblance. Harpoon island from this
implement, which was dug out of the
paud there; Killickstouc island because
it contained these stones for the fisher
men's use. Hungry island because of
its barren condition.; Gull Island is the
lioine of this sea bird, and Its eggs,
wbieu abound there, were often gath
ered for eating purposes until Uncle
Sam put a stop to It; High Island for
its wooded head that looks out over
the surrounding: country; Cow island
was once. used as a pasture, and the
animals were transferred In scows;
Thief Island from a culprit who was
captured there.
Damariscotta was named by the In
dians, who made It a resort for pow
wows, Thrum Cup from Its peculiar
formation. Monehegan once during the
war deserted by the white, the Indian
chief landing there said, "Man he
gone;" Two Bush Island from two
bushes that could be seen from the
sea, Old Hump from its resemblance to
a whale back, the Hypocrites from
their deceiving ledges, which have
lured many a vessel to destruction;
Hatchet island from a stone ax used
by the Indians and found there.
Witch island was known as "Stew
art's" 200 years ago from a supposed
owner. Two cellars and a stone wall
are all the early history that is left
Fore Island from the redoubt built
there as a refuge from Indian at
tacks, Gangway island from its pecul
iar resemblance to this ship's article.
Sequin island was so named by Mogg,
chief of the Canibas tribe of Indians,
who, discovering the white inhabitants
trying to secrete themselves in a small
cave on one side, said, "See go in."
Beaver island, in John's bay, from
the English man-of-war named Bea
ver that anchored behind it and
shelled the fort at Pemaquld. White is
lands are so named from the high bluff
of feldspar that glistens in the sun
light, the Motions, off Booth bay, be
cause they are always agitated, both at
high and low water; the Washbowl
from Its general resemblance to this
useful article, Peter's island from- an
early owner, known as the haunted Is
land. Fishermen's has always been a
favorite resort for the lobster catchers,
Hen Cackle from the chickens once
raised there, Turney island from its
peculiar soli.
Needle's Eye is off Thrum Cap and
forms the outer ledge of the Thread of
Life. It Is the most treacherous point
on our shore, and many vessels bavo
gone to pieces there. Various other
names are found not far from here—
Bulldog, Nigger, Kents, Fosters, Mer
ry island, Little Gins and Skunks Mis
ery. Many of these islands have pecul
iar stories associated with them.
Another reason for the name Mouse
island is its outline, which certainly re
sembles a mouse extended, with its
tall outstretched.— New York Tele
gram.
Mother Couldn't Object.
"Does your mother allow you to have
two pieces of pie when you are at
home, Willie?" asked his hostess.
"No, ma'am."
"Well, do you think she would like
you to have two pieces here?"
"Oh, she wouldn't care," said Willie
confidentially. "This Isn't her pie."—

Wonderfat Minute Sheila.
There is a sand bank at Connemara,
on the west coast of Ireland, that Is the
Mecca of every curiosity seeker who la
fortunate enough to know of its exist
ence. As a general thing sand banks
are not a great attraction, but In this
particular case the attractive power is
not in the sand itself, but in the mil
lions of extinct miniature shells which
are almost as numerous as the grains
of sand with which they are intermin
gled. The largest of these little won
ders is smaller than the smallest pin
head and some of them so minute that
they can easily be put through the eye
of a common sewing needle, yet each is
as perfect as the pearly nautilus, the
spider shell, the sea urchin or any other
marine oddity.
They are of all shapes and forms Im
aginable. One will have the perfect
outlines of a miniature basket another
will look like a fairy's tobacco box,
while a third needs no effort of the im
agination to give it. the form of a bot
tle. The flash shells of Ceylon and Aus
tralia are the only living ' representa
tives of these conchological wonders.
Naturalists who have examined the
Ceylonese flash shells say that each is
filled with a tiny bit of Jellylike sub
stance, which of course Is the animal
Itself , but which is so infinitesimal that
no distinction can be observed between
head and heart, mouth and stomach.
Eskimo Mythology.
Among the Eskimos the sun : is a
maiden, and the moon is her brother
who is overcome by a wicked passion
for her. Once as this girl was at a
dancing party in a friend's hut some
one came up and took hold of her by
the shoulders and shook her, which is,
according to the legend, the Eskimo
manner of declaring one's love. She
could not tell who it was in the dark,
and so she slipped her hand in some
soot and smeared one of his cheeks
with It . When a light was struck in
the hut, she saw to her dismay that It
was her brother, and without waiting
to learn any more she took to her
heels. He started in hot pursuit And
so they ran until they got to the end of
the world, the jumping off place, when
they both Jumped into the sky. There
the moon still chases his sister, the
sun, and every now and then he turns
his sooty cheek to the earth, when he
becomes so dark that you cannot see
him.
Raw Eggs.
When raw eggs are ordered for an
Invalid to whom they are objectiona
ble, .make as palatable as possible by
having the egg as cold as one can make
it and then serve it from a cold glass as
soon as it is opened. Of course it is
useless to serve any save perfectly
fresh eggs.
If the white alone is to be taken, it
should be beaten with a whisk until
very stiff and frothy, then seasoned
with salt or sugar, whichever is prefer
red, and eaten with a spoon.
Some who object to an egg beaten in
a glass of milk, sweetened and flavored,
can take the egg if the sugar is omit
ted and the flavoring extract replaced
by brandy.— What to Eat
Women and Money.
If you would have your women folk
economical, let them handle money
and learn to respect Its value. There
may be women who have not sufficient
womanliness to honor the confidence
this trust implies, but they are excep
tions. If such be your daughters, It is
your business to teach them otherwise.
If they be your wives, it Is your own
fault for having married them. When
a father gives his son an allowance, he
should do the same for his daughter,
not as a matter of material favor, for
the daughter's bills might double the
son's allowance, but as a matter of
discipline, of financial experience and
education.— Collier's.
The Story of Bishop Hatto.
Bishop Hatto was a wicked prelate
who lived in 970 on the banks of the
Rhine, where he owned a tower, which
Is at the present day pointed out to
travelers as the Mouse tower. Here are
stored large quantities of grain. A fam
ine ensued, and the bishop Invited the
people to his granaries. As soon as they
were there he set fire to the building
and burned up the people. The next
morning the souls of the dead appeared
as an army of rats and not only de
stroyed everything belonging to the
bishop, but finished by making a meal
of bis person.
Quick Wit.
Regnier, the French actor, bad once
to call out to a fellow actor who was
expected to enter from the right wing,
"Ha, ha— there you arel" For some un
accountable reason, however, the actor
came on the stage on the left side, and
Regnier, without being in the least dis
concerted, Rave his call and added,
with a smile, "I saw you in the looking
glass."
BONE FOOD
Soft and crooked bones mean
bad feeding. Call the disease
rickets if you want to. The
growing child must eat the
right food for growth. Bones
must have bone food, blood
must have Blood food and so
on through the list.
Scott's Emulsion is the right
treatment for soft bones in
children. Littledoses everyday
give the stiffness and shape

| Home seekers are pouring into
the state at the rate of several
thousands per week. Many of them
will find permanent homes in Cali
fornia. Almost every portion of
the state is receiving benefit from
this inflow of population, commen
surate" with the efforts put forth to
attract, the emigrants. Amador
county, it must be admitted, is doing
absolutely nothing toward directing
a portion of this human tide hither
ward. Why are her people asleep,
when others are so wide-awake on
the subject, and are reaping a sub
stantial reward . for their, trouble?
•The popular idea on the j outside is
that a mining section is necessarily
barren of other resources, and an
undesirable place in which to make
a permauent home. As a matter of
fact, there is no fairer, healthier, or
richer portion of the golden state
than the foothills of Amador county.
Nature has been prodigal of her
gifts, even entirely independent of
the treasures she has stored up in
the shape of gold-bearing deposits.
Not only is "every prospect pleas
ing," but the capabilities of soil and
climate, the latent resources in
horticulture are scarcely sur
passed by any other region in
California, and yet they are lying
neglected— neglected for want of
advertising. While other counties
are adding to their population,
Amador, if not actually backsliding,
is doing no more than holding her
own. The truth is, we have depend
ed too much on gold mining. Nature
has been so lavish in this matter
that we have lost sight of the many
other advantages we possess. We
want systematic organized effort.
This has built up other portions of
the state having far less natural at
tractions than ours. It is reported
that over 100,000 home-seekers pass
through Los ■ Angeles per year.
Many of them settle in southern Cal
ifornia. One of the main reasons
for this is that the people of this
part of the state are ever on the
alert to attract the emigrant.
They know that population means
wealth. The latter is the inevitable
accompaniment of the former in a
new and undeveloped county. Ama
dor county ought to be dotted with
small farms and orchards. Almost
every variety of semi-tropical fruits
thrive here. Land is reasonable in
price. Water for irrigation is
abundant in most sections. It is
true, we lack rapid transportation
facilities. Our great drawback is
the absence of railroad connection
with the heart of the county. With
this dissideratrem supplied, Amador
would "blossom as the rose."
THE PANAMA CANAL.
The Panama canal, the building of
which has been undertaken by the
United States, is by far the greatest
feat of the kind ever entered upon
in the history of the world. To con
nect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
by a waterway sufficient for the
passage of ships has been the dream
of statesmen for hundreds of years.
Many surveys have been made
through the tropical jungles that
cover this narrow strip of territory.
The engineering obstacles to be over
come were so formidable that thirty
distinct surveys were made. After
many years of comparing notes, and
measuring the feasibility of the vari
ous schemes, the Panama route was
deemed the easiest and most practi
cable. A French company, using
the name of De Lesseps — the master
engineer who cut the Suez canal
entered upon the work, and spent
hundreds of millions, most of it
squandered in bribery and extrava
gance, fina'ly became insolvent,
and abandoned the enterprise. It
actually excavated ten miles of the
waterway. This, however, was the
easiest part of the work, as it trav
ersed a flat swampy country- that
presented no serious difficulty other
than the fever which seemed to lurk
amid their fastnesses, and eat up
human lives faster than war. The
Suez canal is 88 miles long; nearly
double the length of the proposed
Panama canal, which will not be
over 50 miles in length. The Suez
canal, however, was a baby enter
prise in comparison with the might
ier work of dividing the two Amer
icas.; For ,a distance of ten miles
the Panama cut will be three hun
dred feet deep. •. At another point a
dam twenty miles loug and two hun
dred feet high will be built to secure
the canal from danger by the flood
waters of the Chagres river. All
reservoirs heretofore constructed by
man pale into littleness beside this
giant restraining wall. To explain
the necessity ,of. a reservoir of sucli
proportions — equal in fact to an ar
tificial inland sea — we may staV*
that the annual rainfall in this reg
ion is estimated at 300 inches— a
deluge of water sufficient to cover
the land— barring 'evaporation —to
an average depth of 25 feet.
The portion already dredged by
the defunct company represents, on
a liberal calculation, not more than
one-fifth of the whole/- Two hundred
million dollars were expended by
that company. The United States
agrees to purchase the French com
pany's rights 'for the sum of $40,
000,000.'" To secure the privilege or
franchise from the Columbian gov
ernment will cost ten millions more*.
The expense of the excavation still
to-be made is estimated at three
hundred million dollars. Ten thous
and men will be kept busy for ten
years to push this- gigantic scheme
to a finish. . It is not expected, thatj
when completed, the tolls received
from shipping will pay anything like
interest on the investment. - The
benefits that will accrue from a com
mercial and stratgetic point of view
will be incalculable . It is meet that
an undertaking of such maguitude-
that dwarfs every other enterprise
conceived by the human mind
should be pushed to a successful
issue by the United States, whose
interests are more vitally identified
with the works than all other na
tions combined.
' In Madera county the records of
the board of supervisors for the last
meeting show 86 different claims al
lowed in favor of as many different
individuals against the various road
funds of that county, the ' total
amount of the claims being in the
neighborhood of $2000. In Amador
county for the same month, the
claims against the road and bridge
funds aggregated 14518, and all but
four bills were drawn in favor of the
five supervisors. The four inde
pendent bills represented about $130.
In Tuolumne county at the same
monthly meeting the road claims
foot up about $1000, with 26 different
claimants, none of them it may be
stated being supervisors. In Cala
veras county the road bills aggre
gated something . like $5000, and
there were 65 claimants entered
upon the minutes of the board to
represent the total amount; Of this
sum $768 was drawn by the super
visors. So it appears from this that
our sister county is going back on
the pernicious example set by the
supervisors of Amador county in
this respect. There is not another
county in the state that can com
pare with Amador in this matter.
It is a vicious system, unauthorized
by law, and it is high time some tax
payer protested these bills presented
by supervisors, and thereby rele
gated the question to the courts for
determination.
A Bohoolmarm's Trialt.
The Sacramento Bee of the 11th con
tains the following:
Amy B. Pharis, a 6chool teacher at
Sutter Creek, Amador county, has
complained to state superintendent of
schools T. J. Kirk that her salary has
been withheld by the refusal of two of
the three' trustees of the district to
sign her salary warrants. In her com
plaint the school teacher states that in
December last a woman teacher visited
the district and that the newcomer had
quite a few intimate friends there,
among them being two of the trustees.
After awhile, alleges the complaint,
the trustees tried to give her place to
the new teacher and began to make it
as unpleasant jas they could for the
present teacher, . thinking she would
resign. She would not resign, and was
advised by county superintendent' G.
Gordon to stand her ground. The
complainant states there are two fac
tions in the district. If one part of the
district likes the teacher the others do
all they can to make it disagreeable
for her, and jealousy reigns supreme,
is the plaint of teacher Amy B. Pharis.
State Superintendent Kirk has refer
red the matter to county superintend
ent Gordon for investigation.
Miss Pharis' home is in Sutter Creek.
She has taught school for the past
term, except the first six weeks thereof,
at New York Ranch, and it is in that
district that the troubles above re
ferred to occurred. It seems that she
was at first engaged for two weeks on
probation. At the expiration of that
time, her work proving satisfactory,
she was engaged for the term. She
taught for the remainder of the term,
in the face of many difficulties, and re
ceived the salary warrants from the
district clerk, but failed to get the same
signed by* one of the other trustees,
and hence her salary has been unpaid
for several months. . On account of this
she has appealed to the state superin
tendent for rodress, the law providing
that in case of failure of the district
authorities to issue the orders for sal
ary, the county superintendent may
draw the requisitions upon the treas
ury, with the approval and at the re
quest of the state superintendent. It
is, we presume, with this end in view
that the matter has been ventilated
before the state officer.

THE AMAUOIi LEDGER: JACKSON, 'OAitFOKNIA, FKIPAY. MAY 15, 1903.
A STARTLING PROCLAMATION.
The following notice, printed on
cards t .in three languages, (English,
Italian and Austrian) was posted in
various places in Jackson yesterday.
The word "Scab" is given promi
nence by being in larger type, and
in "red" ink:
ATTENTION NON-UNION MEN.
Notice is hereby given by Jackson
Miners' Union No. 115, Western Fed
eration of Miners, to all men who are
working in or about the mines ami mills
of Jackson mining district, who have
not got a card in good standing in some
local union of the Western Federation,
on or before the 26th day of June, 15)03,
will lie declared
1 ■ " ■SOA US "" ' ' '"'
and published and treated as such. By
order of the Union.
• W. D. Ould, President.
H. Gobich, Secretary.
Overlooking its faulty language,
the most charitable construction
we can put upon the posting of such
a notice is that those responsible
therefor do not fully realize the
spirit and import of their action. In
its far-reaching consequence this
notice transcends in importance the
late strike, as a full-fledged hurri
cane outranks the gentle zephyr.
We will not at this time comment
upon it as the sober, well-considered
act of an intelligent body of organ
ized laborers. We believe there are
many well-meaning and intelligent
men connected with the Jackson
Miners' Union. Surely, their, sense
of right' will assert itself when they
give themselves time to ponder over
the meaning of this outrage upon
the liberty and independence of their
fellow citizens. Never during the
dark days of persecution, born of
religious -fanaticism, was a more
intolerant and despotic measure con
cocted to stamp out that' noblest
trait of human character — the exer
cise of one's personal freedom to
earn a living as his own conscience
shall dictate, subject only to regu
lation by the laws of his country.
Has it come to pass that the edicts
of labor uuions are stronger to
thwart than the government of the
United States is to protect the indi
vidual citizen in the enjoyment of
this fundamental right. We have
never before heard — not even in the
extremity of a struggle between the
forces of labor and capital, much
less during a period of amity, be
tween these two factors of humau
progress— of a step so radical and
impolitic as the public posliug of a
proclamation of the above character.
If persisted in, it simply demands
an appeal to the courts for' an in
junction to prevent this threatened
invasion of a citizen's rights. We
trust, upon mature thought, the
union will reconsider this action,
and withdraw the offensive notice.
Its publication is libelous. No good
can come of it; much harm may re
sult from persistence iv such a
course. Think of the sweeping
nature of the notice even from a
union standpoint. Identification
with any other labor organization
than the Western Federation will
not count. A man must join that
particular brand of unionism, other
wise his allegiance to the. cause of
organized labor will not avail.
The reception of President Roose
velt in California this week has sur
passed in its magnificence even the
welcome tendered President Mc-
Kinley two years ago. Everywhere
the chief magistrate has been re
ceived with an outburst of enthusi
asm and genuine gladness that dem
onstrates how strongly the people
are attached to him as the head of
the nation. It has been the same
everywhere in his tour through the
states. The United States has in
the past few years stepped to the
first rank among the world powers.
It has greater weight to-day in the
settlement of great international
questions than any other power.
"And the principles and policies of
the republican party led to this
gratifying result. The ppople of the
United States do homage to their
chief executive in outbursts of re
joicing and loyalty, and nowhere is
this expression of devotion to country
more pronounced than in the Pacific
states.

Off for Bine Lakes.
The Standard Electric Company is
sending a large force of men to the
Blue lakes to work on the dam there
the coming season. About 25 men left
Jackson Tuesday morning, intending
to take the direct route over the moan
tains. They will be conveyed by team
to Ham's station, about 35 miles from
Jackson. From that point they ex
pect to foot it for the remainder of the
trip, about 50 miles. The snow has
disappeared as far as a few miles above
Hams. Each man will have to pack
provisions and blankets with him. The
men are to get from $2.50 to $3 per day,
pay to commence when they reach
their destination and commence to
work. The first work will be to clear
the road from Gardenville to Blue
lakes, so that supplies and material
can be hauled in from the Carson side.
Active operations on the dam itself
will commence early next month. It is
expected to complete the Blue lakes
dam this, season. ' The trip of these
men going in at this early season, is a
difficult and hazardous one. There
has been a very heavy snowfall. The
white mantle is many feet in depth
from above Ham's clear through. To
tramp for two days at least over this
glistening wilderness is an undertaking
calculated to tax the physical endur
ance to the utmost.
A Nuisance That Should Be Abated.
Main street of Japkson seems to be a
rendevous for dogs that are continually
disturbing the peace of citizens whose
business calls them on the street.
Whenever a strange canine comes
through town then the racket begins.
Big dogs, little dogs, short tail dogs,
and long tail dogs all join forces and
set up a howl beyond endurance. The
nuisance is daily aggravated by some
reckless boy who, "for the fun of the
thing," helps matters along by adding
words of encouragement to' the howl
ing brutes. Quite a number of the
dogs have owners, while others are of
the "hobo" fraternity, but they all need
calling down. It is true the people of
Jackson have become somewhat accus
tomed to the Indian village style of af
fairs, but what an impression it must
make on a stranger in our midst. Dogs
can't be blamed for the state of affairs,
neither can boys. They like fun and
excitement, but it is somebody's busi
ness to suppress it, and the Ledger in
tends to do its share in that direction.-
Jackson School Census.
The returns of the census marshals
of the respective districts have ail been
forwarded to the school superintendent,
Geo. A. Gordon, but have not yet been
examined and corrected by that officer.
It will take a couple of weeks yet before
the official returns are in shape for
publication. The returns, unofficial, for
Jackson district show 450 census chil
dren between 5 and 17, against 448 for
last year— a gain of two. The total
number of children of all ages up to 17
is 619, against 634 for 1902— a loss of 15.
These figures are subject to correction
by the school superintendent.
Leg Broken.
A man named Giuseppe Malinelli,
commonly known as Jos. Campi, who
lives across the creek from the South
Spring Hill mine, near Amador City,
was the victim of a serious accident
last Friday. He attempted to walk
across the foot bridge crossing the
gulch to his residence, with a heavy
load, when he missed his footing, and
fell, fracturing his left leg just above
the ankle. The fracture is a bad one,
the bone protruding through the skin.
The unfortunate victim is 70 years of
age, and this fact adds to the serious
ness of the case. Malinelli was brought
to the hospital Saturday. Dr. Gall is
doing his utmost to save the limb, and
so far the patient is doing as well as
could be expected.
Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign.
Take Scott's Emulsion for it. For
weak digestion, for defective nourish
ment, for consumption, take Scott's
Emulsion. It restores flesh because it
btrikes to the cause of the loss.
lone Picnic a Snccess.
The picnic held at lone last Friday
under the auspices of the Rebekahs
was a grand success. Jackson and Sut
ter folks were there by the hundreds
and all report as having an enjoyable
time. The music was furnished by the
Jackson Band. The feature of the day
was the ball game between the Lodi's
and Jackson's, which resulted in favor
of the "melon" team, the score being
Bto 3. At the ond of the seventh in
ning the "mother loders" were ahead,
3 to 2, but at a fatal moment an error
was made causing defeat. A return
game between the opposing teams is
expected in the near future.
Delegates to Grand Parlor.
At a meeting of Ursula Parlor No. i,
N. D. G. W., Mrs. Ella Caminetti and

May 23d. All good things will be pro
vided, and a general good time is ex
pected. Everybody come and help on
the good cheer.
Judge Davis returned to Jackson last
Saturday, after an absence of nearly
two months. He left on Monday for
San Francisco, to be present at the re
ception given to President Roosevelt.
Last night the President was the guest

Davis delivered the address of welcome.
We, of Amador, all know the Judge's
fitness for the occasion, and shall re

THE AMADOR LEDGER; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MAY 15, 1903.
LOCAL MINING NEWS
Notes From Amador County Mines.
Central Eureka Pays Dividend.
South Eureka.— After an idleness
of several months, the twenty stamp
mill was started up this week, on ore of
better grade than has been encountered
for a long time.
Kennedy.— Seventy stamps are kept
steadily at work at this mine. It is
expected that 10 more will be started
shortly. The new hoist is being push
ed toward completion as fast as possible.
All the new boilers are in place. An
other six weeks or two months will no
doubt see this mining machinery — by
far the most costly enterprise of the
kind that has ever been attempted in
Amador county— in active operation.
Emmons.— J. Cranmerof Pine Grove
was in Jackson Monday and disposed
of the clean-up of about 6 tons of
rock, a test crushing- from this prop
erty. The result was a trifle over
3} ounces of gold, which sold for $16.50
per ounce. This average yield was
within a fraction of $10 per ton. The
rock was taken at a depth of about 50
feet from the surface. There is a
strong vein, over six feet thick, and
assays from the entire ledge show a
value of between $5 and $6 per ton.
The Cranmer brothers will go to work
and take out some more rock, and in
tend to move their mill from Elsie
creek to the property should the pros
pect coutinup tp be favorable. The
mine is situated about a quarter of a
mile in the rear of the -Pine Grove
hotel property.
Central Eureka.— At a directors'
meeting held in San Francisco Thurs
day, May 7, W. J. McGee was elected
a director. A dividend of two cents a
share was declared, which means $8000
to be distributed jirqong the stock
holders. Everything at the mine is
running smoothly under the direction
of superintendent W. R. Thomas.
From the annual report of this com
pany just issued we take the following
interesting items: During tho year
43,545 tons of ore were milled, against
21,785 tons for the preceding year.
The shaft is 2100 feet pn the incline,
with the ore body showing strong at
the bottom. Most of the ore worked
during the year came from the 1900
and 2000 foot levels. The cost of min
ing and milling for the preceding year
was $4.47} per ton, while the record
for the past year shows the total cost
at less than $3 per ton, which speaks
volumes for the management, especially
when it is considered that the ore bad
to be hoisted from greater depths than
the previous- year. Following is an
itemized statement of the operations
for the past year;

Accidents Will Happen.
Last Sunday week a party of Jack
son's young people went out to the
Tabeau reservoir for an outing. The
day was well spent, but the pleasure of
the return trip was somewhat marred,
that is so far as one couple was con
cerned, by an accident which caused
them untold anguish and humiliation.
It was the breaking of the front axle
of a buggy which was occupied by a
prominent young business man of Jack
son and a young lady, whose sweet
voice can be hoard any day in any part
of Amador county. The trouble began
about one mile this side of the reser
voir, and at the "parting of the ways"
Miss — her forefathers were presi
dents—was thrown to the ground and
received a good shake up but happily
escaped injury. The driver managed
to hold on to the lines and was dragged
by the horse several yards before the
animal could be brought to a standstill.
He was somewhat bruised, but likewise
escaped injury. The screams of the
young lady in question brought the
carriage immediately in front of them
to a standstill. After ascertaing the
cause of the alarm, the "cause" was
taken in and conveyed to Jackson,
while the cattle dealer, as such being a
good rider, mounted his buggy horse
and made his lonely way to the city.

the cart. The horse attached to the

bystanders rushed to assist, and pre
vented serious damage by their timely
aid.
Religious Notes.
Rev. Geo. Beatty of San Francisco,
who is engaged in Sunday school work
in connection with the M. E. church,
delivered a few lectures in Amador
county during the past week. Last
Monday night he lectured at the M.
E. church in Jackson, and his discourse
was interesting and displayed the true
ability of Mr. Beatty as a forcible
speaker
Bishop Moreland of Sacramento,
diocese of the Episcopal church,
preached to an appreciative congrega
tion at St. Augustine's chapel in Jack
son last Sunday. Confirmstion was
conferred on several who were admitted
as members of the church. He preach
ed in the forenoon to the Sutter Creek
people at their church. The Bishop is
a hard worker, and his efforts in behalf
of the Amador county portion of his
district has reaped extraordinary re
sults in the up-building of the churches,
A Bright Start In Life.
Dr. G. M. Freeman jr., a recent
graduate of Cooper's Medical College,
and his mother, have been spending a
few days in Jackson, as the guests of
Mr. and Mrs. F. A. Voorheis of the
National. They loft Monday morning
for the city. Dr. Freeman is an ex
ceptionally bright young man. His
college class was composed of forty-six
students, and be stood first in the
graduation class, which is certainly a
record to be proud of. Dr. Freeman sr.,
the father of the young man, formerly
practiced medicine in lone and Sutter
Creek, . and his many friends in the
county will be pleased to hear of his
son's substantial start in life.
Rural Delivery.
The postmaster of Jackson has re
ceived from the authorities at Wash
ington a request for maps of Amador
county, showing roads, dwellings, and
other information concerning the coun
ty. The information is sought with a
view to the introduction of the rural
delivery system in this county, if deem
ed advisable after a full investigation.
No map of Amador county has been
published since 1881, so that a com
plete map, showing the data required
up to the present date, Is not procur
able. It is thought that a set of plats,
like those made for the insurance busi
ness, showing the lots and residences
in each town, would answer the
purpose.

FROM CORRESPONDENTS
Letters From Volcano, Pine Grove,
Plymouth and Amador City.
Volcano, Cal., May 12, 1903.
In the last week's issue of the Ledger
was chronicled the sad and sudden
death of Dr. Albert N. Robert of this
place, and a tribute paid to his sterling
worth; but it is here where he was
best known that his death brings sad
ness to the many hearts. It has been
his mission to do much good, and his
patients became his faithful friends.
The sorrowing faces about his bier told
more Impressively than words how
universally he was beloved .
The room where the casket was
placed was filled with beautiful frag
rant flowers— a pillow in white carna
tions and ferns, bearing the words
"Our brother," from the Masonic
fraternity, which order conducted the
funeral services according to their
beautiful and impressive ritual. A
selected choir from Pine Grove and
Volcano sang a number of appropriate
hymns. The brothers of the mystic
tie then consigned the remains of their
well-beloved brother to the grave,
made beautiful by loving hands. Dr.
Robert's place in our midst cannot be
filled, and we grieve in submitting the
decree of an unerring God.
Rest, rest— His sleeping alter pain;
When lights are down and curtains close, we
sleep;
The stars watch on, their pale rays faintly
beep
Their unseen vigil o'er the slumbering one.
Not death— but rest— the music of the spheres
The angels' lullaby of sweet repose.
We should not weep^'ils well-.«Qod knows.
And it is sweet to sleep.
Such strenuous living 1 How the pulses throb!
Life's little triumphs— joys— its cares and
pain;
The wondrous workings of the busy brain.
Till It is time to rest— He calls us home
Think not of death, but rest.
More peaceful and profound, that does not
dream
In half-unconscious pain.' It should not seem
That dreadful parting— surely He knows best.
'Tls hard to say "good-by," but not "good
night" 1
We all must sometimes sleep at close of day.
And if the weary one can only pray
With soul unstained— 'tis well;
"He giveth His beloved sleep," why weep?
The wayward, weary, sin-stained soul needs
rest-
Rest, rest, Indeed, like those their works op
. pressed
For them the angels weep— we all need sleep.
Not death, but God's own rest I
Volcano, Cal., May 13.
Our little tpwn is not often called
upon to witness the sad sight of two
open graves in one day, but such was
seen last Thursday. Mr. Marble died
on Tuesday of last week, and near by
his grave was that of Dr. Robert, who
also died on Tuesday. Mr. Marble had
reached the age of eighty-five, and
had been in feeble health for some
time. He was an old settler, and for
many years ctltivated a small patch of
ground for strawberries, from which
he made a good living, until extreme
age rendered him incapable of attend
ing to his work.
Mrs. Ginocchio and daughters,' who
have been visiting friends in Volcano
for the past week, returned to their
home in Reno, Nev., last Saturday.

Mullen said goodbye to her many
friends and pupils (the lady has been
very popular) and took her departure
for lone, where she will spend a vaca
tion with her mother.
A new school organ has been pur
chased with the funds raised by enter
tainments given by the school children.
Rev. Geo. W. Beatty of San Fran
cisco lectured in the M. E. church
Friday evening, selecting as his sub
ject, "The power of knowledge." The
gentleman is an able and interesting
speaker, and bis lecture was greatly
enjoyed. The ladies of the church
served ice cream, and a social hour
followed. '
The dance on Saturday evening was
well attended, quite a number being
present from Jackson and Volcano,
Every one enjoyed the dance, but
thought the raviola supper at Gillick's
hotel the crowning feature of the
event.

PLYMOUTH.
Plymouth, May 13.— 1t seemed as

kitchen roof of Mrs. Millman's resi

dence, which had caught from • the
stovepipe. 'No serious damage was
done before the flames were extinguish
ed. Everything had been carried out
of the house. The* kitchen roof was
all that had burned, and is now re
placed with a new one.
The next morning at about 2:30, peo
ple were startled from their sleep by
the alarm of fire. This time it was
found to be the building of the sul
phurets works of the Pacific mine. The
fire was too far under headway before
the alarm was given for anything to be
done, so the building was burned to
the ground. The loss is estimated to
be about $2000. The cause of the fire
is unknown.
Preparations are being made for the
school entertainment to be given at the
close of school.

An Automobile Came to Town.
P. E. Holt, of the Holt Manufactur

IN MEMORIAM.
The following resolutions were adopt
ed by the Volcano Lodge, Noi 56, F_
& A. M.:
Whereas, it has pleased the Great
Master of the Universe to remove from
earth the soul of our beloved brother,
Dr. Albert N. Robert, it is fitting that
we should place upon our minutes a
record of his death, and of our sorrow;
therefore be it
Resolved, that while we bow in hum
ble submission, to thejdecree of an all
wise Ruler we grieve because of the
loss which our lodge, and the people of
the community, have sustained in the
death of our treasure, and greatly be
loved brother, Dr. Albert N.Robert.
Resolved, that our brother was an
able and conscientious man, who won
the confidence and respect of all classes
as he lived among them, practicing his
profession. He was deeply attached to
the lodge and we most truly mourn the
loss of a good mason.'
Resolved, that we tender our heart
felt sympathy and condolence to the
relatives of the deceased.
Resolved, that these resolutions be
entered upon our minutes, and a copy,
with the seal of the lodge attached, be
sent to the family of the deceased
brother.
Fraternally submitted,
f Clarence Bradshaw.

How many people of this county have
visited the Agricultural Experimental
Station located about four miles above
Jackson? This is truly an Interesting
place, and no one interested in fruit
culture should fail to visit this beauti
ful place and learn what can be pro
duced in the way of fruits without Irri
gation. The station has been in exist
ence for fourteen years, under the
supervision of the state university, as
sisted by federal appropriations.
When this location was selected by
the government it was for the purpose
of ascertaining the worth of the soil
peculiar to the foothills for agri
cultural uses. It is needless to say that
the experiment has been a success. The
fact has been demonstrated beyond a
doubt. Through the courtesy of J. H.
Barber, who has charge of the station,
the Ledger has become acquainted
with the many details of the work. At
the present time thirty acres are under
a state of high cultivation, and the
crops produced are marvelous. It
must be understood that the land now
in use Is what is known as "hill tops,"
part of which is red clay soil, inter
mixed with granite, and was formerly
covered with chaparal and pine trees,
the same as can be found anywhere in
this locality. Every kind of fruit tree
and grape imaginable are grown, and
show health and productiveness, -and
the whole secret lies in cultivation,
which example should be followed by
all who wish to gain a good livelihood
by raising fruit. We will print from
time to time statements and statistics
to be furnished by Mr. Barber for the
benefit of our readers, and if they profit
thereby, farming can be made a suc
cess in this county. In fact it is a suc
cess. All that is required is proper
attention and work.

~~ SENATE ETIQUETTE.
It Came Near Slaking Roosevelt Hiss
McKlnley's Inauguration.
• A vice president seated ln solitary
grandeur ln the senate chamber, while
the ceremony of a presidential inaugu
ration to which be has been invited as
an honored guest ls going qn outside,
surely presents a spectacle with an ele
ment of humor ln It Few persons
know how near Theodore Roosevelt
came to playing such a part on the 4th
of March, 1001. The senate stickles
fo for minor details of etiquette that
the most strenuous reformer, would
hardly venture to transgress its rules,
and they require that a formal motion
to adjourn shall be put before a day's
session can come to an end. After hia
inauguration as vice president in the
senate chamber Mr. Roosevelt took the
gavel and, when the routine business
wns finished, directed the sergeant at
anna, as usual, to proceed with the
ceremony of inaugurating Mr. McKin
ley as president
It was then ln order for some senator
to move an adjournment, but in the
confusion nobody seemed to have his
wits about him, and the whole assem
blage, including tho senators, quitted
the chamber for tho east portico, where
the oath wns to bo administered and
the address delivered. In a few min
utes the vice president found himself
alone, with a fair prospect of remain-
Ing so until the day's performances
were over, but It chanced that Senator
Heltfeld missed his bat while passing
through the corridor and came back to
look for It Face to face with tho vice
president it occursed to the senator
that something must be wrong, so with
the utmost gravity be 'moved "that
the senate do now adjourn." Mr.
Roosevelt with equal solemnity, put
the motion, declared it carried and
proceeded ln Mr. Heltfeld's company
to tbe place on the presidential stand
which had been reserved for him.—
Francis E. Leupp' in Century.
Shadow 'Superstitions",
Our proverb, "Devil catch the hind
most" is based on one of the curious
shadow legends. According to the fa
ble, the devil had a regular school at
Toledo, Spain. Commencement was
Inaugurated by the graduating class
running through a long subterranean
hall. Tbe devil hid at a place known
only to himself, and If be "caught the
hindmost" he ever after claimed him or
her as his special property. Sometimes
he only caught the shadow, and the
persons thus deprived of their "second
self" were supposed to make the best
astrologers and magicians.
Nearly all East Indian tribes as well
as the Malayans and several African
sects believe that if a man walks
along tbe south bank of a river casting
his shadow ' across the water a croco
dile will seize It and thus draw the
owner to certain death.
Several writers, Flske among the
rest, say that the Zulus have a supersti
tion similar to that of the old Baby
louinM — viz, that a dead body has no
shadow. The Modocs and the Kla
maths of Oregon formerly refused to
have their pictures taken for fear that
the process would take away their
shadows. In the Aryan folk tale the
"wltchdalo," or "Infernal Sabbath,"
was celebrated only' by witches' shad-^
ows.
Hitch Your Wagron to a Star.
A student of the horse thus explains
where Emerson's epigram, "Hitch your
wagon to a star," originated: Long be
fore tbe war there was a famous trot
ting stallion of the name of American
Star, belonging to one Beely. Ameri
can Star mares became scattered all
through New England and New York,
for they were the best roadsters in the
country, and every farmer must have
one. It soon became well understood
that in order not to lose the respect of
the community one must drive nothing
else. Later It became a subject of ban
ter. If one farmer passed another on
the road, he would look over his shoul
der and shout, "Why don't you hitch
your wagon to a star?" Unquestion
ably Emerson many a time had heaid
the remark, and ln his lecture on
"American Civilization" at the Smith
sonian Institution ln ISO 2he rung it
ln for the first time, advising mankind
ln general to aim high and "Hitch your
wagon to a star," thus converting a
common Incident into a figurative al
lusion.

THE FIRST TAILOR.
HE MONOPOLIZED THE SARTORIAL
TRADE OF THE WORLD.
Ills Method! Were Crude, and Hla
Materials Were Uathcr Grotesque,
but He Turned Out Good, Honest
'Work, Hand Stltcned Throughout.
The first industry of the world was
tailoring. The first maker of clothes
mil the first wearer was Adam. Of
tills strange character who appears on
the pages of history ln the dual role of
the first tailor and the first customer
we have but a brief biography. TJio
meager details require sympathetic in
terpretation to make up a complete
story. Of his father and mother no
mention ls made, but the record shows
he was destined to be a clothier of
some Bort, for be was put Into Eden to
"dress" the garden. We do not know
If he obeyed this command, as his
- biographers do not so state, for, it
seems, Instead of "dressing the gar
den he "dressed" himself.
His early marriage and the trouble
relating to tbe theft of some fruit with
sundry other unpleasant details pre
ceded his work as a tailor. He began
in a humble way; just himself ana
one assistant He was one of the early
settlers ln a newly opened country, a
land of natural advantages which must
soon attract other inhabitants. With
a large and Increasing population fie
foresaw that there must come a grow
ing demand for clothing If he could in
troduce them and make popular his
new invention. He was a pioneer. He
had no competition. He controlled the
tailoring trade of the world. Thus
with the first industry came the first
trust
As he busily piled his needle we
know not what visions of future busi
ness and wealth filled his ambitious
mind. But never ln his wildest dreama
did he conceive that his little tailoring
establishment, employing only four
hands, doing only a local trade and
turning out the first custom made gar
ment would be the beginning of a
ready made clothing business that ln
the United States alone gives labor to
hundreds of thousands of hands and
covers an Investment of a great many
million dollars.
But of the' great wealth that has
come from his Invention Adam, like
most pioneers, made no money what
ever and died leaving his family with
out a penny. Even his name is not as
sociated with his wonderful discovery,
but— such is the sarcasm of time— lt ap
pears only ln the word Adam's apple,
in memory not of his virtues, but of aa
escapade of his wife.
- Though even Carlyle has not recog
nized j Adam's sartorial genius, there
are some capital points in the work of
this first tailor.
He originated the style himself. Ho
was not a, petty trader on the reputa
tion of others and Imitating their fash
ions. Even in the names for the gar
ments he was original. The first suit
of clothes, In reality only a girdle or
belt, lie humorously termed an "apron."
It ls difficult to determine the season
of tho year. Judging from the coolness
of tho suit. It might have been a sum
mer style, but as It was Jnst a little
after the fall it was probably early ln
the winter.
Tlioy were hand stitched throughout
Tboy contained no machine work or
cheap labor. The workshop was in the
open air. and, although tailored in the
sweat of his brow, no sweatshop work
wns possible.
The material was not of the best but
Adam found no better at band. Some
of the modern tailors, making shoddy
garments at shoddy prices, imitate
Adam, who used "leavings."
As to Adam, the first customer, when
he was alone ln the world he never
thought of dress, but when he came to
the realization of himself as an indi
vidual and in relation to others be be
gan to spruce up. Courtship led him
to beautify himself, to appear well in
tho eyes of "the only woman he ever
loved." Human nature has not changed
much.
With the entry of society dress be
gan. Perhaps this ls why dress forms
so prominent a feature ln society to
day.
After eating the apple of knowledge
the mind of Adam was suddenly Illu
minated as If by a thousand electric
lights. A great thought of large, prac
tical, worldly wisdom flashed before
him. He realized that to amount to
anything ln the world he must make a
good appearance. In this he struck a
keynote of business success.
Surely he needed to keep up appear
ances. He reflected over his actions
for the two weeks prior and then
looked at his future. He had been in
bad society and had been seen with a
disreputable serpent he .had been led
into temptation, he had broken the law,
he was implicated in an apple theft as
accessory after the fact be 'bad some
of the stolen goods in his possession
and he was a fugitive from justice, for
he was then In "hiding." Discovery
was certain. He was to bi evicted
from his home and in disgrace had to
face the awfulness of actually earning
his" own living by work. Then, after a
mild attack of remorse, be was equal
to the situation and in a manly way ac
cepted it, made himself a suit of clothes
ln which he could make a decent ap
pearance and began life anew with the
courage, hope, pride and confidence that
comes from the consciousness of being
well dressed.— William George Jordan

A Oath at Ttflls.
To take a bath at Tiflis ls to court
a wonderful experience. Abundant
springs of water, strongly Impregnated
with sulphureted hydrogen, supply the
building and in its vaulted chambers,
far Itelow the street, there is no sound
but the splash of the fountain and the
rolling echo of one's own voice. Henry
Norman gives a description of the
masseur who presides over the bath
and makes its most eccentric feature.
"He is a Persian, who speaks but a
word or two of Russian. His head is
shaved, a rag is twisted round • his
waist, and his feet are dyed orange.
"First he rubs you, and then sudden
ly, as you He face downward on the
marble slab, he is upon your back, his
feet dug into your spine, his hands
grasping your shoulders, to increase
tho pressure. Slowly, with skillful ap
preciation of. every muscle, his feet
grind up and down your back. • They
encircle your neck. They are on your
head.
"Then he vaults lightly off, and in a
moment from a linen bag filled with
soap he has squeezed clouds of per
fumed bubbles, and you are hidden in
them from head to foot as completely
as If you had fallen Into a snowdrift
You are not absolutely bruised, but
you are clean." .
Sn-ertneia That Never Falls.
During a sleepless night , the Vizier
ftiujjeduddln Kumlja dispatched his
slave, Bcdruddln EJas, to bring him
sweets. The slave procured a copper
kettle heaped with many kinds of
fruits and sweets, and Mujjeduddln be
gan to eat . (
"You relish them, my master?" asked
the slave.
The vizier shrugged his shoulders.
"These fruits are sweet— for the mo
ment," he said, "but show me a fruit
the sweetness of which will endure
even unto the judgment day."
"Such fruits there are, my master,"
cried the slave" and hastened toward
the Meschcd Husa, where he awoke
the starving orphans ln the house of
Allwin and led them forth and into the
room of his master. Overjoyed, the
famished children devoured the fruits.
"Look, oh, my master," said the
slave. Here you see fruits the sweet
ness- of which endures unto the Judg
ment day."— New York Press.
Betrothal Customs.
The Scandinavian bridegroom pre
sents to his betrothed a prayer book
and many other gifts, which usually In
clude a goose. She ln turn gives him,
especially ln Sweden, a shirt, and this
he Invariably wears on his wedding
day. Afterward he puts it away, and
under no circumstances will he wear
It again while alive. But he wears It
tn his grave, and there are Swedes
who earnestly believe not only ln the
resurrection of the body, but to the
veritable resurrection of the betrothal
shirts of such husbands as have never
broken any of their marriage vows.
Tbe Swedish widower must destroy on
the eve of his second marriage the
bridal shirt which his first wife gave
him.
To 801 l Water Without a Kettle.
"My wife and I,", says a traveling
man, "were once ln a hotel where we
couldn't get any boiling water. After
we had discussed the situation my
wife asked me if I had an envelope In
my satchel. I got one out when she
told me to fill It with wafer and hold
It over the gas jet I hesitated, but
finally did it and expected to see the
envelope blaze up every minute. But
it didn't blaze. The envelope took on a
little soot but that was all. The water
boiled ln time, and tbe envelope was as
good as ever when the experiment was
at an end. I don't know the chemistry
of the process, but try it yourself and
see if It will not work."
The Oriental Amethyst.
The oriental amethyst is really a vio
let colored sapphire, which ls an ex
ceedingly rare gem and of brilliant lus
ter. It is regarded as a sacred stone,
and It ls used to ornament the cross
and the pastoral ring of Catholic bish
ops. The ancients often used the ame
thyst for cutting figures both in relief
and in Intaglio, and there is ln the na
tional library of France a delicately
wrought profile of Maecenas, a Roman
statesman of Octavius' time, engraved
on amethyst by Dioscorides, one of the
four celebrated engravers mentioned
by Pliny.
Caught the Students.
There was formerly a barber ln Har
vard square who caught the university
custom with this classic appeal which
some friendly patron suggested:

Et abl alter Adonis.
"Traveler, stay, submit your neck to
the barber and depart a second Ado
nis."
Businesslike.
"Some people," said the caller with
it slight sneer, "seem to think that
signing checks ls the most Important
thing in life."
"I know It" . rejoined Senator Sor
ghum, "and It's a mistake, my boy; a
sad mistake. Getting the money ln
bank in the first place is what counts."

"But I am so unworthy, darling,"

AT A HORSE AUCTION.
The Proceedings aa Viewed Fiy>m
tbe Horse's Standpoint.
Skipper' wns a police horse and tbe
pride of the mounted squad until he
acquired a Spavin. Then he was sent
to a sales stable. His experience*
there as told by Sewell Ford |in
"Horses Nine" were as follows:
Skipper was led into a big ring be
fore a lot of men. A man on a box
shouted out a number and . began to
tulk very fast. Skipper gathered that
he was talking about him. Skipper
learned that he was still only six years
old and that he had been owned as a
saddle horse by a lady who was about
to sail for Europe and was closing out
her stable. This was news to Skipper.
- The man talked very nicely about
Skipper. He said he was kind, gentle,
sound ln wind and limb and was not
only trained to the saddle, but would
work either single or double. The man
wanted to know how much the gentle
men were willing to pay for a' bay
gelding of this description.
Some one on the outer edge of the
crowd said, "Ten dollars."
At this the man on the box grew
quite indignant He asked if the other
man wouldn't like a silver mounted
harness and a lap robe thrown in.
"Fifteen," said another man.
. Somebody else said "Twenty," an
other man said "Twenty-flve," and still
another "Thirty." Then there was a
hitch. The man on the box began to
talk very fast Indeed.
"Thutty, thutty, thutty, thutty! Do
I hear the five? Thutty, thutty, thut
ty, thutty. Will you make it five?"
"Thirty-five," said a red faced man
who had pushed his way to the front
and was looking Skipper over sharply.
The man on the box said "Thutty
flve!" a good many times and asked if
he "heard forty." Evidently ■he did
not, for he stopped and said very slow
ly and distinctly,' looking expectantly
around: "Are you all done? Thirty
five—once; thirty-five— twice; third—
and last call — sold for $351"
• When Skipper heard this, he hung
his bead. When you have been a $250
blue rlbboner and the pride " of the
force, it Is sad to be "knocked down"
for $35.
INSTINCT IS THE TEACHER.
How the Young of the Feathered
Tribe Are Educated.
There ls a school of the woods, just
as much as there is a church of the
woods or a parliament of the : woods
or a Society of United Charities of tho
woods, and no more. There is nothing
In the dealing of animals with their,
young that ln the remotest way sug
gests human instruction and discipline.
The young of all the wild creatures do
Instinctively what their parents do and
did. They do not have to be taught;
they are taught from the jump, says a
writer in the Atlantic Monthly.' Tho
bird sings at the proper age and builds
Its nest and takes its appropriate food
without any hint at all from ■ its par
ents. Tbe young ducks, take to tho
water when hatched by a duck and
dive and stalk insects and wash them
selves just as their mothers did. Young
chickens and young turkeys under
stand the various calls and signals of
their mother the first time they hear or
see them. At the first alarm note they
squat; at a call to food they come on
the first day as on the tenth. The hab
its of cleanliness of tbe nestlings are
established from the first hour of their
lives. When a bird comes to build its
first nest and to rear its first brood, It
knows how to proceed as well as It
does years later or as Its parents did
before it The fox is afraid of a trap
before he has had any experience with
it and the hare thumps upon the
ground at Bight of anything strange
and unusual, whether its mates be
within hearing or not No bird teaches
its young to fly. They fly Instinctively,
when their wings are strong enough.
Difference In Prayers.
Little Alice always said her prayers
regularly before going to bed. One
night however, as she rested her head
on the pillow she remarked, ln a ques
tioning way:
"Mamma, my prayers are so much
longer than the one nurse says in the
morning. Can't I say hers when I'm
tired?""
"Does the nurse pray in the morn
ing?' asked the mother with a puzzled
look.
"Yes," said Alice sweetly. "She says,
'Lord, have I got to get vi ."'—New

Liszt at Seventy-five.
Even at seventy-five Liszt was a pi
anist whose powers lay beyond the
pale to which sober language or calm
criticism could reach or be applied.
Enough that Its greatest charm seemed
to me to lie ln a perfectly divine toucb
and in a tone more remarkable for ex
quisitely musical quality than volume
or dynamic force aided by a technique
still incomparably brilliant and superb.
