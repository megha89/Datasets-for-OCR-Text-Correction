Eyes differ, and naturalists have
only a very imperfect understanding
of wbat the various animals cau see,
but from late experments Leon J.
Cole, a Harvard zoologist, finds that
insects and reptiles may be divided
by the acuteness of their vision into
four types. The tirst, of which the
earthworm is a representative, is
without eyes, a sensitive skin enabl
ing it to distinguish between dark
ness and light. A second type has
visual organs, but they form no de-
Unite images and are affected only by
tbe intensity and direction of the
light. Creatures of tbe third type
have eyes that distinguish between
equally lighted objects of different
size. In the fourth type, tbe eyes
perceive objects, and vision is much
like our own. Just what is the use
of the many small images formed by
tbe compound eyes ot insects is still
uncertain.
Electro-chemistry is in its infancy,
but its products already include
mineral and artificial organic colors
that promise to become serious com
petitors of tbe coal-tar dyes. The
new coloring matters are precipitated
by the electric current from suitable
solutions. In this way Sobeele's
green, Berlin green, vermilion,
Japanese red, cherry red, cadmium
yellow, zinc white and certain
organic oolors are now obtained on
a commercial scale, and tbe list will
doubtless be rapidly extended.
A curious mirage reported by Dr.
C. U. Knott was seen in South Africa
by members of a cadet corps. With
tbe town ot Worcester behind them,
they saw about four miles oil, appar
ently on the other side ol the river, a
recognizable image of tbe town itself.
A strange phenomenon in a land of
strange natural history is the recent
transformation of one of New Zea
land's harmless insect eating birds
into a tierce and cruel bird of prey.
Less than forty years ago a number of
curiously torn sheep were brought to
tbe notice of some farmers and about,
tbe carcasses were seen several speci
mens ot the kea, a mountain parrot
found only in tbe South Island,
where it ted on insects and berries.
Convicted on - this feeble circum
stantial evidence, tbe kea bus been
regarded as the slaughterer of thou
sands ot sheep that have been since
destroyed. To give tbe accused bird
a fair trial and settle an important
scientific question. Prof. U. K.
Marriner, of Canterbury College, bas
been lately seeking more conclusive
evidence than that recorded, and has
succeeded in finding over thirty men
who have witnessed tbe killing. One
or two ut tbe keas usually attack a
selected sheep with tbeir strong
beaks, while other look on and come
in for a share of tbe spoil. Dr. A.
K. Wallace and others bave asserted
that tbe kidney is sought as a special
delicacy, but it appears instead that
tbe handiest portion of tbe flesh is
torn out and eaten. Prof. Marriner
favor* the theory that the birds
acquired a taste for meat while hunt
ing maggots on dead sheep.
Chain lightning and other lumin
ous phenomena near earthquakes bave
been attributed to friction of the
rocks. Noticing that a chalk pit near
bis house seemed to glow at times
with a varying light, Prof. John
Milne has exposed strips ot photo
graphic paper moved by clockwork
near the rock in tbe Isle of Wight
and in Cornwall, and development
bas shown curious apots, bands and
other markings, with intervals ot
many days with uu record. These
dark patches cannor be imitated by
electric discbarges.
Tbe physical effects of several days
of automobiling. upon both normal
and anaemic persons are found by A.
Mouneyrat to be those of a stay in
the mountains— red blood being in
creased, with stimulation ot respira
tion, circulation and nervous system.
Several ether explosions that occurr
ed in chemical works in I'JUU have
been investigated by Dr. M. Kiohter,
and it is shown that tbe evaporation
of very volatile liquids may charge
objects in contact with electricity
and give rise to sparks. In a few
instances, men holding a funnel
through which ether was being poured
have received shocks and even seen
sparks. Wool agitated with light
either became positively charged with
a potential as high as 2,000 volts, but
the charge was much slighter with
heavier ether. Evaporation of oarbou
bisulphide may give a charge up to
13,000 volts, making it surprising
that this substance is not often
ignited spontaneously by sparking.
Addition of some impurity may lessen
risk in some cases, and one-hundredth
of one per cent of magnesium oleate
prevents danger of the electrical
sparking of benzine. It is recom
mended that in handling these liquids
all metallic vessels, retorts and pipes
bave good earth connection and glass
or earthenware funnels be used in
stead of metal.

This is repeated ten times a year, and

Japanese lacquer, an Oriental pro
duct that remains unrivalled, is made

vated in both China and Japan, and

its brilliance, great enduranoe and

On Wednesday nigbt a second vote
was taken by tbe members ot tbe
miner's union of this town for the
purpose of deciding whether the offer
made by tbe superintendents of the
mines bere would be aooepted or re
jected. This offer was nine hours tor
tbe under-ground men, they to come
and go on their own time; tbe top
men ten hours, the mill men twelve,
"ibis had been voted upon and ac
cepted at a previous meeting aud
many of tbe men had returned to
work, but owing to what was said to
be some irregularity in tbe vote, it
was taken up a second time, and the
outcome was au even greater sur
prise than tbe first vote. There were
144 in favor of the strike being de
clared off, with 63 in favor of it still
continuing. This was indeed a great
surprise, as it had been thought that,
in view of the vote cast at tbe elec
tion of officers held tbe night before,
that the proposition would be reject
ed; especially so, as there were a
great many members present from
Amador and Tuolumne counties, wbo
declared tbeir intention of voting for
Ibe strike to continue. However, the
conservative element stood together
and good results were had. After the
final vote had been announced and
the news reached the street a great
celebration was held; fireworks were
exploded, bonfires -were lighted, and
tbe two bands marched up and down
the street furnishing all kinds of
music for the occasion.— Angels

At Liverpool.
Friend Emerson :
As stated in previous letter, we
arrived at Liverpool Aug. 13. Our
baggage was taken in charge by cus
tom officers and we claimed it at tbe
proper station. We were asked what
we had of dutiable nature in trunks,
as there was none they took our word
and O. K'd. it, as we bad some cigar*
and tobacco in our hamper we told
them, and they requested us to show
it. It was passed as tbe quantity was
too small, and now W9 are aurry we
did not bring up to tbe limit, as the
price of tobacco is three or four times
as high here as with you, to say noth-.
ing ot quality or flaror.
We procured lodgings in a private
hotel near the center of the city at 5
shillings per day, without board.
As a large quantity of foodstuffs
must be imported, tbe oost of living
is as high or higher, quantity and
quality served, than with you. Meats
and breadstuff's bring as much or
more than in tbe U. S.
We soon started sight seeing, tbe
first thing that struck us was tbe
double deck trolley cars, they are
very convenient for sight seeing, and
tbe tare is one or two pence accord
ing to tbe distance, up to a certain
point it is a penny, beyond that
another pence la collected, but tbe
distance is not as great as in Ameri
can cities. Ail buildings are stone
or brick with slate or tile roofs.
There are no skyscrapers, so elevators
are not needed. Tbe buildings are
substantial, but owing to tbe narrow
streets and small windows the rooms
are dark, especially on cloudy days,
which so far seem to be the majority.
The city is densely populated, and tbe
buildings are all black with smoke,
which greatly mars their beauty.
Tbe largest building is St. George's
ball, where public meetings and con
oerts are held, also court. The court
room while being tine, is not as large
as yours, hardly any provision being
mnde for loungers or trie curious.
There Is a large open square around
the building, all parked and supplied
with seats, but also with signs "keep
off tbe grass." There are numerous
statues, among them being large
equestrian statues of Queen Victoria
and Prince Albert. Also a statue of
Lord BeaconsUeld and four colossal
stone lions in front of the ball, and
numerous statues of M. Ps. and other
prominent public men of tbe past in
the park at the rear. Close by is tbe
Brown's Free Library, also the
Museum of Antiquities and tbe
Museum of Fine Arts, in all of which
we spent considerable time.
Every day the police band of 45
pieces plays during tbe noon hour in
front of St. George's hall, they play
eight pieces, tbe last two always
being "Rule Pnttania" and "God
save the King," and while tbe crowd
immediately melts away as soon as
they start the first meatevid, all the
"bobbies," as they call the police,
soldiers, marines and ex-soldiers'
come to attention, and stand as if on
paiade till the band stops, while the
more patriotio citizens bare tbeir
heads.
We visited the St. Peters also St.
IN icbolas churches. All tho churches
are quaint, in tbeir carvings and con
structions, and each has its indivi
dual peculiarity and beauty. Wo
also visited the immense docks for
which this city bas a wide world re
putation. The large market houses
make a great display, and the fisb
markets are a sight in the early
morning.
A great deal of the work, which
you have done by negroes, chinaman
and Japs is here done by women. So
much stone step scrubbing and brasa
door knob, bell pulling aud knockers
and sign polishing to be done every
morning, and always by women.
Men and boys are used here a good
deal in place ot horses, pushing hand
carts, even tbe parcels post is de
livered by hand carts, no delivery
system of groceries etc., to families
like with you, if you buy it you carry
it. Moat ot the horses used are very
large, heavy and slow stepping, pull
heavy loads in two wheel carts or
drays, but the streets are the beat
paved and cleanest I bave seen. The
street cleaning being done by large
boys not men, twice a day. Every
thing moves slow, even the trolleys,
no danger of getting run over by any
thing. Business does not begin be
fore 9 a. in., except tbe markets.
Although there are many ale houses,
you do not see tbe rushing, in and
out ot them like in American pities.
You must also look sharp to find
a barber shop, bair-outting Ito 3
pence and shaving 'I pence. No won
der they have no French plate mirror
parlors, with tbeir hydraulic chairs.
The chemist shops, as drug stares are
named here, are aleo small, dingy,
150 years bebind-tbe-times affairs,
charge fully as much as in California,
but as tbe people here bave not the
drug swallowing mania, they do little
business. There are some very nice
stores in other lines, one being after
tbe Emporium style.
Tne weather baa been very cool, 62
degrees or lesa on an average, with
showers. We always carry umbrellas.
We enjoyed our sightseeing hero for
three days, and were nicely treated
by every one we met, especially tbe
"bobbies," who are a tine looking
set of men and as tar as 1 know not
graters. Saturday Aug. 94, we re
sumed our journey of which more
hereafter. From Waltenapiel.

afternoon of tbe same day be was seen
in the vioinity of the old North Star
boarding house in Happy valley,
which is about a mile from this

and which Coggswell admitted he
started, but said it was accidentally.

Will A. Dower, the attorney for the
mineral claimants, who about two
years ago contested the claims of
several timber applicants to certain
lands situated along the Lioking Fork
of tbe Mokelumne river near West
Point, has been notified that the de
partment of the interior has affirmed
tbe decision ot Sacramento land
office, and of tbe general land office,
in which it was held that tbe land in
dispute was mineral m character, and
awarded tbe same to tbe mineral
claimants. J. L. Haley, W. W. Cook
and O. J. Houston the owners of the
mining claims, involved in the con
test had held and worked tbeir claims
for a number of years when Howard
B. Land, A. F. Martel and several
other persons located timber claims,
covering tbe mining locations. It
was contended by the mineral claim
ants, that the timber claimants were
not acting in good faith in making
tbeir timber filings, but that they
were seekng to obtain title to tbe
land in tbe interest of tbe Sierra
Nevada Power and Water Company,
for a reservoir site, as a part ot tbe

EVANS TO BE FREED.
Convicted of the Murder of ' Messe
nger Tovey, now Proven Innocent.
Mike Tovey, the express mess
enger of Wells Kargo's Express Com
pany on tbe lone stage Hue, was shot
and instantly killed while making
the trip to Jackson on tba stage in
June, 1894, by a highwayman in a
ambush about two miles east of the
Mountain Spring house. Bill Evans,
a half-witted fellow, was arrested for
the crime in Calaveraa county, sheriff'
Thorn being at that time the execut
ive officer. A large reward was otter
ed for the arrest and conviction ot
the perpetrator. The case was vigor
ously proseonted in the superior
court of this county. John W. Davis
waa then superior judge, and K. C.
Rust district attorney. D. B. Spag
noli was appointed by the court to
defend the accused, and he was a
assisted at the trial Jby Samuel Dun
lap of atockton. The detectives of
Wells Fargo were not satisfied that
Evans was the guilty man, and tbe
sheriff's office in Amador county
shared in these doubts. But tbe
officers of Uaiaveias pressed the prose
cution, the substantial money reward
being an incentive in that direction.
Evans was convicted, on what was
deemed by maby rather glim evidence.
lie was sentenced to life imprison
ment in San Quentin, and has served
thirteen years in that institution.
Nothing has since occurred to
strengthen the impression of bis
guilt, but rumors have been afloat at
different times that an effort would
be made to secure his release on
parole or a pardon.
Now comes the Call of Monday
last, and c hums that the innocence
of tbe convict has been established,
and that he will shortly be released.
That paper says:
Alter having served 13 years in San
Quentin penitentiary, it developed
yesterday that William Evans, one of
tbe convicts, is an innocent man.
Proof positive that he did not com
mit tbe crime for which he was sen
tenced is now in tbe hands of the
proper authorities. The judge who
passed tbe sentence declares Evans is
innocent, tbe man who prosecuted
him made deathbed statements that
he was innocent, and in a short time
Evans will be allowed to leave the
penitentiary, minus i;s years ot life.
Against Evans were arrayed a num
ber ot officials, eager to share a large
reward offered for the conviction of
tbe perpetrator of the crime. Despite
bis pleadings a jury found against
him. For 13 years he has played tbe
part of a convict. For 13 years he
brooded over the injustice which bad
robbed him of life, to know at last
that bis innocence has been proved
and that he may take bis place among
his fellows as an equal.
Early in 1894 a daring attempt at
highway robbery took place in Amu
dor county, in which messenger Tovey
was shot dead. A reward was offered
for their capture and in a short time
Evans, a logger, was arrested. Evans
bad served a short term in San
Quentin once before on a similar
charge. Concerning this former
affair he had declared that be was
drunk and entered a bouse which was
robbed that nigbt. Ihe evidence in
tbs case was very alender, but it was
sufficient to send Evans to the peni
tentiary. When brought to trial a
second time, tbe fact that be Jhad
served time weighed heavily against
him.
Confronted by a chain of. circum
stantial evidence forged fraudulently
by bis prosecutors, Evans could only
alter denials, but of wbat avail were
tbe denials of an ex-convict* 1 He bad
only liia word against that of the
officers of the law, and the latter
won. Tbe jury found him guilty and
judge John F. Davis sentenced Jhim
to the penitentiary tor life. JTbe
prison door shut behind him and
Evans was blotted out of existence.
The logger became a thing with a
number, remembered by few and
cared for by none. Year after year
be led tbe life of a convict. The
rankling bitterness and brooding at
the injustice of it all stamped them
selves on his features, but be worked
on patiently, quietly, hoping that
some day something would occur
which would give him back bis
liberty.
Tbe "something" occurred when
one of bis prosecutors died a short
time ago. Nothing definite was
known, but it was lumored that he
bad confessed on bis deathbed the
railroading ot Evans to tbe peniten
tiary.
Evans bad been forgotten. For
years he bad been a number— nothing
more— aud there was none to tight for
him. Then the rumors started afresh
and tbe American sense of justice
and desire for fair play resulted in
tbe matter being taken to the proper
authorities.
At a meeting of tbe prison directors,
United States Attorney Kobert T.
Devlin and Tirey I* Ford were ap
pointed a committee of two to in
vestigate Evans' case; but Ford was
engaged in righting his own liberty,
and Evans, in the cells at San
Quentin, waa kept waiting.
In tbe meantime, detective John N.
Thacker of tbe Wells, Fargo express
company interested himself in tbe
affair, and after a great deal of
trouble obtained proot of tbe man's
innocence. Judge Davis, who bad
tried Evans passed ipon tbe proof
and declared Evans innocent. War
den John E. Hoyle of San QuentiD
said the same.
Now Evans is waiting in the peni
tentiary until the neaessary legal step
shall have been taken tor bis release.
Within a few weeks he will pass out
tbrougbt tbe penitentiary gates a free
man.

Why Elephants Fear Mice.
It seems incredible that so small
and harmless an animal 'as a mouse is
able to frighten an elephant almost
out of his senses. One little moos*
in the bay on which they are feeding
will stampede an entire herd. Id
their native land there are little
animals, known as cbacanas, wblob
fetid on a small, soar berry of whiob
elephants are very fond. They live
in settlements, something after tbe
manner of prairie dogs, under tbe
berry bushes. Wben feeding, the
elepbants trample tbe little towns,
and the obacanaa, in their frigbt, run
up tbe tubes of tbe elephants' trunks.
J heir long, sharp olaws oatob in tbe
flesh, and tbey oannot be ejected.
The more violently tbe monster blows
through its coiled trunk the more
tirmly the hooked claws of tbe little
animal become imbedded in tba
flesh. inflammation and deatb are
tbe result. In oaptivity tbe elephant*
think tbey are in danger of the dead
ly chacanas wben tbey see a mouse.

The Tax Levy.
The board of supervisors have fixed
the tax levy lor the current year, tor
State and county purposes, at 92 ou
each $100. Tbia is the same as last
jear, notwithstanding a material iu
trease, arbitrarily in tbe assessed
aluation of property, amounting to
Sfcbout b quarter of a tnilliou over tbe
assessment of last year. For tbe past
four years the rate baa been held at $2
on tbe $100. For tbe sake of com
parison, we publish in parallel
columns tbe levy for tbe various
funds for tbe past live years, so that
our readers will be able to see where
tbe increased expense comes in.

It was hoped that the increased
assessment roll would enable tbe
supervisors to make a reduction in
the tax rate. This hope has proved
fallacious, as it usually does in sucb
oased. The increase of property
valuation acts rather as a stimulus to
exact more money for governmental
purposes from taxpayers, by simply
allowing the total levy to remain the
same as tbe previous year. On a
valuation of 15,714,713, leaving tbe
exemption of the city of Jackson
from road and bridge taxes out of
consideration, $2 on the $100 will
give a revenue of $114,294, or an
average of more than $1 per bead per
month tor every man, woman and
child within tbe limits of Amador
county— which is probably tbe com
pactest county in the state, and
therefore should be one uf the most
economically governed.
For the cunent expense fund the
revenue will be over $31,000. For
roads and bridges nearly $30,000, and
with the road poll tax the amonnt
will be swelled to nearly $35,000 that
would be available for road mainten
ance by tbe supervisors. Except,
however, that property within tbe
city limits of Jackson will be exempt
from the road and bridge levies. For
school purpose the sum raised will be
less than $19,000; to which will be
added tbe i> mount received from tbe
state.
Jt is evideut that as a rule property
holders will be called upon this year
to pungle up more money in settle
ment of tbe exactions of tbe toll
gatherer than they were last year.
The abnormal increase in tbe de
mand for bridge construction tbU
year will be given as the main reason
for the extra money required. Five
bridges are to be constructed, three
of them joint bridges, the cost ot
which will fall equally upon Amadoi
and neigh boring counties. l'ully
$11,000 will be raised by the levy ot
19 1 2 cents for that fund. lint there
is always something comes in tbe way
to prevent a rednced tax rate, and the
cost ot tbe local government goea on
piling up from year to year, with its
bad effect upon tbe prosperity of tbe
county. In El Uoiado they have a
tax rate ot $2 - the same as in ama
dor. J'he Republican commenting
upon this heavy toll in tbe way of
dead investment, says it is an in
vitation to those wbo are in tbe
county to retire from it, rather than
an inducement for new settlers to
come in.
Within the city limits of Jackson
tbe state and county rate will be
81.47}£, and the ojty late 70 cents,
making a total HL17& Tbe heavy
expense tor road and bridge mainten
ance does not fall upon the incorpor
ated city, and that is certainly a re
deeming feature of this year.

To Ledger Patrons.
Malcolm b. Calkins, a son of Tbos.
L). Calkins, formerly proprietor of
tbe A mad or Kecord in Sutter Creek,
has secured an interest in tbe busi
ness of tbe Annular Lodger. He will
look after tbe outside work, solicit
ing business, actiug as local reporter
and take tbe general oversight of tbe
business end of the newspaper aud
iob printing. The editorial manage
ment will remain, as heretofore, and
no change will take place in tbe
policy o£ tha paper. Tbo editor is
aware that be is unable to attend to
all tbe details of the business, that
tbo services of a young and active
man are necessary. The Ledger has
no reason to complain at tbe measure
uf patronage that hbs been accorded
it in tbe past. it has come without
solicitation on our part. 'The strength
of the Ledger to-day consists as it
has done for many years past— in tbe
confidence reposed by tbe people
generally in its conduct. Sometimes
tbey may diifer ftom tbe views ex
pressed, but withal they art- satisfied
that its course is dictated by honest
motives and a desire for the welfare
ot tbe taxpayers aud tbe community
generally.
Tbe editor bas neither the activity
nor tbe inclination to get around as
be was wont to do twenty-five years
ago. He, therefore, yields this to
younger hands. Mr Calkins is known
to many in this county, having at
tended for years the public school ot
Sutter Creek. He is young and
ambitious. He is throughly con
versant with the newspaper business,
latterly doing outside newspaper
work in Alauietia couuty. He is not
working on a salary or commission
basis., but in promoting the interests
of tbe Ledger, h« is thereby mainly
advancing bis own interests at the
same time. We earnestly commend
him to tbe people of the county, as
wortby of confidence and encourago
ment. He comes with the intention
of making Amador county bis per
manent borne, preferring this seotion
to the valleys or tbe bay region.
Morally and pbysicallv, right living
carries its owe reward. No man can
violate the laws of bis physical being
for any length of time, witbout meet
ing witb tbe piicks. There is a cer
tain reserve force in nature which
may compensate in a muasure for
slight infringements for a time, but
tbe rule is that natuie will exact tbe
penalty for wrong doing. The sajuo
rule holds good in the moral world.
To live in accordance witb one's con
victions of duty carries its highest re
ward. Often it is not appreciated by
ttose who for self interest or native
perversity adopt a different cuutse,
but the majority of evil doeis have v
wholesome raspoet tor a conscientious
regard for duty, notwithstanding any
outward conduct to tbe contrary.
ihe approval or cue's own con
science is of infinitely greater irrport
ance than the empty plaudits of men.
It is more than an offset to the abuse
heaped by sell-seekers upon one who
tries to do bis duty. It is tbe friend
tba! stays witb him under all circuni
-tauces. Witb this selt-approval be
is enabled to face all adverse circum
stances witb serenity, and cares little
or nothing what others may say. No
man should be indifferent to (be
opinion of bis fellow men. It is
human to court tbe good opinion of
others. Witb many this desire is tbe
overpowering passion. To be popular
in tbe general acceptation of that
term is tbe sole aim, and everything
is made subservient thereto. Such
persons constitute the mere driftwood
on the ocean of life. Others, while
appreciating the good will of their
fellows at its true wortb, lefuse >o
depart from what they believe to be
tbe path of right in order to gain it.
ibis course may prove outwardly
stormy, but tends to self-contentment
and satisfaction.

Through all tbe sad to-morrows,
When tbe sunny smile has ceased to

That smiles away all sorrows.
What shall 1 do, my friend,
When you are gone forever?
My heart its eager need will send,
Through tbe years to find you,
never.
And how will it be with you,
In tbe weary world, 1 wonder?
Will you love me witb a love as true,
Wben our paths lie far asunder?
A sweeter, sadder thing,
My life for having known you; .
Forever, with my sacred kin,
My soul's soul, 1 must own you;
Forever mine, my friend,
From June till life's December;
Not mine to have and bold,
Mine to pray for, and remember.
The way is short, my friend,
That reaches out before us;
Uod's tender heavens abeve us bend,
His love is smiling o'er us.
A little while iv ours,

I'll lay tbe band you love in yours,
On tbe shore of the hereafter.

Hunting Party's Experience.
A party of eleven from Jaokson
started on a deer-hunting expedition
last Sunday. The buntera were H. E.
Kay, C. Dalporta, N. Cardinelli, A.
Laverone, C. B. Arditto. G. D. Cal
vin, Al Hambrio, Al Vela, William
Clark and Herbert Clark. These
went out in a two-horse spring wagon,
hired from tbe Union livery stable.
Johnny Garbarini went on horseback
to rustle up the game. Tbey went
tbree or four miles south of town.
Keaobing tbe bunting grounds they
bitcbea the team to a tree— one horse
being tied with the one rope tbey
had, and tbe other tied with tbe
lines. In this way they were left,
alone, while tbe party went to hunt 1
game. They were gone not to exceed
halt an hour, and on tbeir return tbey
found one of the horses choked to
death. The horse hitched by the
lines bad broken loose, and by con
tinual tugging had caused tbe weight
to be thrown on tbe oue tied with tbe
rope, causing strangulation.
Ihey were about to start home when
the misfortune was discovered. Tttis
happened on the Plasse ranch. Ibe
riding horse" of J". Garbarini was
pressed into servioe, and tbe com
pany drove home. They captured
one fine deer. They sighted nine cr
ten during the day.
Dr. Endiuott, F. b. Lemoin and
Gus Mann, who event up to blue creek
last week on a fishing trip, returned
Friday. At West Point they were
juined by tbe two Smith brothers,
making five in tbe party. The first
afternoon they caught 205 troot, and
tbe next afternoon managed to swell
the number to 323. Fred Lemoiu
caught sight of two bears, and shot
at one, without result. He killed a
small rattlesnake, having three
rattles, and brought tbe bide home as
a trophy of bis adventure.

Initiating the Freshmen.
On Friday evening last tbe cere
mony ot initiating tbe freshmen, of
the lone Union High school were ob
served in the pavilion ot the valley
town. This ordeal corresponds with
the "hazing"^ of the universities and
other high edncational institutions of
the country, which has called forth
such a storm of protest at different
times on account of the severe punish
ment inflicted in some cases. At
lone tbe initiation exercises were
very simple. Several from Jaokson
were duly pat throush the routine.
All tbe freshmen— new scholars— were
blindfolded and seated in a row.
The installing officers were tbe sopbs
and juniors, each ot whom carried a
bottle of water and a small bag ol
flour, anointing eacb freshman by
mixing tbe flour and water on his
bead. The ceremony of whitebeading
being concluded, tbe rest of tbe even
ing was passed in dancing and serv
ing refreshments. Every one bad a
gjod time. Tbe only unpleasant re
sult was that a number of the fresbies
showed up at school tbe following
morning with a bad cold.
Poisoned from Eating Castor Beans
Thursday evening of last- week two
ohildren ot F. Mologuoni were poison
ed, supposed to be from partaking
of castor te'ins that grow in tbe gar
den, l'he family lives at Jaokson
Gate. The children wore Amelia, 14
years of age, and Victor, aged nine
years. They were taken violently
sick soon after, with vomiting and
purging. Tbe girl, although she ate
more of the beans than her brother,
was not so severely ill. Tbe boy was
in a critical condition for several
days, and for a time it was extremely
doubtful whether he would recover.
Dr. Phillips attended the cases.
Castor beans are ot a poisonous
nature. It is reported that tbree
have been sufficient to cause tbe
death of an adult. The Molognoni
children are believed to have eaten a
larger quantity eacb.

Surplus in tbe treasury September 1,
$67,578.26. Tbe mill bas been runn
ing for tbe past two months largely
on low grade rook, th^t bad to be got
rid of, hence the reduced output as
compared with previous months.
This month it is expected to make a
material increase in tbe yield, that is
if tbe mill is not interfered with on
account of laoK of electric power to
operate. Tbe new hoisting works aie
making satisfactory headway, and
everything abont mine and mill is
looking very prosperous.
Fremont.— This mine has developed
a small stringer of uuusuailv rich ore
of late; some ot it yielding Sbveral
dollars per pound. The company has

Refused to Roll Logs.
Monday evening about fcuiteen
men quit at the Zeila mine, all of
them being Austrians. It seems tbat
when tbe men went to work night
shift abont six o'clock, they were
told to roll or pile a lot of logs that
were in tbe way. Ibis is a frequent
occurrence. It would take but a
short time. But the Slavonians ob
jected to doing that work, on the
ground ot night time. It was bright
moonlight. Mr Detert told tbem
they could either do tbe work tbey
were asked to do or quit. From
twelve to fifteen quit, and were at
unce paid off. The Italians made no
objections .to tbe work.
Deservedly Promoted.
Dr. C. H. Gibbons has received a
letter from his daughter, Mrs Maud
Murphy of Skagway, informing him
of tbe promotion ot Mr Murpby to
the superintendenoy of tbe Dawson
and Klondike Railroad. For some
time he bas been in control of tbe
Skagway and White Horse road, and
bas managed tbat difficult line with
such efficiency that he has 'been
offered and accepted tbe higher posi •
tion. Tbe toad runs from Dawson
through tbe Klondike mining region,
and is over fifty miles in length. It
is owned by London capitalists. He
is under engagement for two years, at
a salary of 8500 per month. Mr Mur
pby and family will makn their home
in Dawson, and in fact are now
settled in tbat city. They were given
a farewell dance in Skagway on tbe
eve of their departure for their new
home. Mrs Murpby, nee Maud Gib
bons, lived in Jackson for a oouple of
years, and her many friends here
about will be pleased to hear of this
promotion. Ihe Alaskan of August
lei, published in Skagway says:
The Alaskan is very sorry to learn
tbat E. A. Mqrpby and iamiiy will
shortly leave Skagway to make their
future home in Dawson, where Mr
Murpby will assume full control of
tba interests of the Klondyke Mines
Railway Company. Mr and Mrs -
Murpby have been prime favorites in
this city and tbeir departure will be
much regretted in a social way. Mr
Murphy is a most excellent business
man and The Alaskau is certain tbat
tbe management of the Dawson com
pany has fallen in good bands. It is
tbe intention of Mr Murpby to leave
within tbe next few days and Mrs
Murpby and children will follow
shortly after. They were given 7a
farewell danoe on the eve of their
departure.
Fractured His Skull.

conscious condition, and removed as
speedily as possible to the Siena
Sanitarium. An operation was per
formed for bis relief by Dr. Lyaah.
He never recovered consciousness,
and died Monday morning.

A Lazy Liver 
May be only a tired liver, or a starved
liver. It would jbe a stupid as well as
fi savage thing to beat a weary or starved
man because he lagged in his work. So
in treating the lagging, torpid liver it Is
a great mistake to lash it with strong
drastic drugs. A torpid liver is but an
Indication of an ill-nourished, enfeebled

Investigation of other people's affairs, '
his oblique green eyes, with their
squint of cowardice and perpetual j
hunger, says the Outing Magazine, that
should have a place in thfe adornment
of escutcheons. It is notorious that
the vicissitudes of his belly never
bring to him the fate upon whose
verge he always lives and that nothing
but strychnine, and not always that,
will bring an end to his forlorn career.
As his gray back moves slowly along
above the reeds and coarse grass and
he turns his head to look at you he
knows at once whether or not you
have with you a gun, and you cannot
know how he knows. Once satisfied
that you are unarmed, he will remain
near in spite of any vocal remon
strances and by and by may proceed
to interview you in a way that for un
obtrusiveness might be taken as a
model of the art:
Lie down on the thick brown carpet
of the wilderness and be still for twen
ty minutes, and, watching him from
the corner of your eye, you will see
that he has been joined by others of
his brethren hitherto unseen. He
seems to be curious to know, first, if
are dead and, second, if by any
Chance — and he lives upon chances
there is anything else in your neigh
borhood that he might find eatable.
Ifr you pass on with Indifference,
which is the usual way, he will sit
himself down upon his tall on the
nearest knoll and 101 l his red tongue
and leer at you as one with whom he
is half inclined to claim acquaintance.
He looks and acts then so much like a
gray dog that one is inclined to whistle
to him. Make any hostile demonstra
tion, and he will move a little farther
and sit down again.
If by any means you manage to of
fend him deeply at this juncture, the
chances are that he and his comrades
may retire still farther and then bark
ceaselessly until they have hooted you
out of the neighborhood. That night
he and some of his companions may
come and steal the straps from your
saddle, the meat from the frying pan —
and politely clean the pan— and even
the boots from beside your lowly bed.

A QUEER CALCULATION.
The Power That Would Be R«quiree
to Move the Earth.
Statisticians sometimes have queer
Ideas. One of them amused himself
by calculating how much energy, water
and coal it would take to move the
earth a foot, supposing that It was sub
jected throughout its mass to a force
equivalent to terrestrial gravitation.
This is a gratuitous supposition, for In
spite of its enormous mass the earth
weighs nothing.
Starting with the fact that the
earth's mass is about 0,100 milllon
milliou-mlllion tons, our statistician
calculates that we should require 70,
000,000,000 years for a 10,000 horse
power engine to move our globe a foot.
The boiler that should feed this engine
would vaporize a quantity of water
that would cover the whole face of the
globe with a layer 300 feet deep. The
vaporization of this water would re
quire 4,000 million-million tons of coal.
This coal, carried in cars holding ten
tons each and having a total length of
thirty feet, would require 400 million
million cars, which would reach 80,
000,000 times around the earth. This
tram, moving at the rate of forty
miles an hour, would take more than
5,000,000 years to travel Its own
length. It would require for storage a
shed that would cover 1,000 times the
area of Europe.
If we realize that this fantastically
huge amount of energy is nothing at
all compared with what the earth pos
sesses in virtue of its rotation about its
axis, Its revolution about the sun and
its translation In space with the solar
system, of which the earth is but an
infinitesimal part of the universe, we
may get some idea of the importance
of man in the universe and estimate
his incommensurable pride at Its just
value.
A PIQUED BONIFACE.
Meilhac and a Costly Dish That He
Did Not Eat.
Among the most absentmlnded of
geniuses was the French composer,
Meilhac. On the occasion of the first
presentation of one of his operas Meil
hac, In evening dress, entered a fash
ionable restaurant and threw himself
down at a table, thinking earnestly
about the event of the evening and
nothing else.
A waiter brought him a menu. Meil
hac, a man of very simple tastes In
the matter of food, abstractedly Indi
cated with his finger the first dish on
the bill that his eye had struck. Now
It chanced that this was the most elab
orate and costly dish on the bill, and
when the waiter went to the kitchen
with the order there was In conse
quence great commotion there. The
proprietor himself was summoned, and
he and the principal chef devoted them
selves to the preparation of the famous
dish. One mnn was sent for this
choice Ingredient and another for an
other. Meanwhile Meilhac waited, ab
sorbed.
At last the dish was brought with a
great flourish, and the proprietor, with
a proud smile, stood not far away to
observe the result. When it was de
posited in front of him Meilhac regard
ed the dish with an expression of mel
ancholy Interest.
"Did I order that?" he asked.
"Certainly, M. Meilhac."
"Do you like it?"
"Yes — yes, monsieur; but" —
"Then kindly take it away and eat It
yourself," ordered Meilhac, "and bring
me two fried eggs."— Chicago Record-
Herald.

KNEW HER GRAMMAR.
The Landlady Wrote Correctly and
Wat Not to Blame.
A London gentleman advertised for
apartments at a fashionable watering
place and received many replies. lie
pitched upon one chiefly because it
mentioned a splendid "sea view," and,
as it was not convenient for him to
leave his business to see the apart
ments, he closed with the offer by
post, sending a substantial deposit.
When the time came for him to take
his holiday he duly arrived at his
destination and was surprised to 'find
that not a glimpse of the sea was ob
tainable from any window of his
apartments.
'"I thought you said there was a
splendid sea view?" he said angrily
to the landlady.
"So there is, sir," replied the land
lady, drawing his attention to a picture
on the wall, a really excellent painting
of the sea.
"Why, you — cr — cr — What do you
mean by such a swindle?" gasped the
gentleman. "I meant a view of the
real sea."
"Oh, did you, sir?" coolly said the
landlady. "If you will refer to my
letter you will see that I distinctly
stated there was a splendid sea view
'in' the drawing room. Had I meant a
view of the real sea I should have said
there was a splendid sfci view 'from'
the, drawing room. I cannot think how
an educated gentleman, as you evi
dently are, could have made such an
egregious error!"— London Tit-Bits.
WING SHOOTING.
It Cannot Be Taught to Hunters by
Reading Books.
Wing shooting can no more be theo
retically taught than can riding, skat
ing, sailing a boat, milking a cow or
playing the violin. Practice and perse
verance in this, as in all field sports,
can alone make perfect, while the most
persistent effort even then often fails
to make a "crack shot." Certain rules,
however, must govern the beginner,
which, If observed, will materially aid
him In becoming an expert.
When a novice takes the field for
game he is very apt to become flus
tered, or "rattled," at the critical mo
ment when the bird is flushed, and
then he will stare, open mouthed, and
wonder how it happened. This often
occurs in the field, -and the tyro invari
ably has some plausible excuse to of
fer. His "gun was not cocked," he
"stubbed his toe just as the bird rose"
or some equally weak explanation is
made, or else he lays all the blame on
his dogs, whose thoughts, could they
but express them, it would be interest-
Ing to Interpret.
The best wing shooters do not close
one eye in aiming, nor do they follow
the bird In its flights with the muzzle
of the gun, but closing one eye is ad
mittedly better than tightly shutting
both, as many young would be sports
men have been known to do. — James
W. Dixon in Recreation.
Wagner's Childlike Happiness.
While in London in 1855 Wagner
took a walk every day In Regent's
park. There, at the small bridge over
the ornamental water, wonld he stand
regularly and feed the ducks, having
previously provided himself for the
purpose with a number of French rolls,
rolls ordered each day for the occasion.
There was a swan, too, that came hi
for much of Wagner's affection. It
was a regal bird and fit, as the master
said, to draw the chariot of Lohengrin.
The childlike happiness, full to over
flowing, with which this Innocent occu
pation filled Wagner was an impress
ive sight never to be forgotten. It was
Wagner you saw before you, the nat
nral man, affectionate, gentle and
mirthful.— From Ferdinand Praeger's
"Wagner as I Knew Him."
Huxley's Larger View.
James Hannay, once a member of
the staff of the Pall Mall Gazette, was
a typical man of letters. And Huxley,
as everybody knows, was a typical
scientific man. Hannay had been a
midshipman when Huxley was a naval
surgeon. Years after the two met
each other on the steps of the British
museum. "Huxley," said Hannay, "I
care nothing for man except as a crea
ture of historical tradition."
"Nor I," answered Huxley, "for him
except as a compound of gas and wa
ter.
"But," he added, "If we were each
of us better educated men than we
are we should know how to respect
each other's studies more."
Had to Take Him Down.
"Why does Mrs. Everson have her
own baptismal names engraved upon
her card instead of those of her hus
band? She Isn't a widow, is she?"
"No, but I understand that she had
a batch of cards engraved once upon
which she styled herself 'Mrs. William
Edgar Everson,' and he was so puffed
up over It for two or three days that
he actually seemed to think he was the
head of the family. It Is never safe to
give some people too much leeway, yon
know."— Cleveland Leader.
Either Way.
"If you do not take care of your
money," said the ant to the grasshop
per, "the world will simply sneer and
ask what you did with it."
"Yes, and If I Invest It and become
rich the world will sneer and ask me
where I got It."— Washington Star.
Wrinkles.
A small boy of an Inquiring turn of
mfnd, says the Philadelphia Inquirer,
looked at his father earnestly and ask
ed:
"Father, what are wrinkles?"
"Fretwork, my son— fretwork," Im
plied paterfamilias confidently.
An Up Stroke.
Sometimes lightning strikes up In
stead of down, if we are to believe a
story told many years ago of a party
of men standing on the porch of a
church far up on the side of a lofty
mountain ha Styrla. They were look
ing down into the valley below, where
a great electrical storm was raging,
and, with the sun shining upon them
at their altitude, were enrapt by the
strange sensation. Suddenly a bolt
came up from the valley and killed sev
en of the party.— Circle.
Going and Coming.
"What's that noise?" asked the vis
itor in the apartment house.
"Probably some one in the dentist's
rooms on the floor below getting a
tooth out," said his host.
"But It seems to come from the floor
above."
"Ah! Then it's probably the Popleys'
baby getting a tooth In."— Philadelphia
Press.
THE CAMEO.
It Gets Its Name From the Cutting,)
Not From the Stone.
The true nature of a cameo is very
much misunderstood by the public gen- 1
erally. Most people think it Is the stone
Itself, when in reality the method of
cutting is what produces the cameo.
The real meaning of the word Is un
known, Its derivation having never '
been discovered; but, correctly speak
ing, cameos are small sculptures exe
cuted in low relief on some substance
precious either for its beauty, rarity or I
hardness.
There are emerald cameos, turquoise
cameos, shell cameos, coral cameos.
Indeed, any substance that lends itself
to carving In such minute detail can
be used for cameo cutting, and nearly
all precious stones, except diamonds,
have been so used for intaglios, but
never for cameos. Emerald Is the most
common precious stone from which
cameos have been made, and there are
some very flue emerald portrait cam
eos in existence, notably those of
Queen Elizabeth in the British muse
um. Shell cameos were first made in
the fifteenth century.
Banded onyx is generally used for
cameo work because of its hardness
and coloring, and it is this fact that has
caused the misapprehension, the stone
being used so much in making cameos
that it has now become better known
as "cameo" than by its right name.—
St Louis Globe-Democrat
ANIMAL TRAITS.
Reminders In the Foal and tho Calf of
Their Wild Ancestors.
It Is an interesting study to note in
domestic animals the traits of their
wild ancestors. There are some char
acteristics, of course, which are readily
recognizable as being similar to those
of animals still In a wild state, and
for this reason they give a fair Idea of
the life and surroundings of progeni
tors. The habits of the dog and cat
are too familiar to comment on, but
take the foal and compare his traits
with those of the calf.
The foal when a few days old can
gallop as fast as he ever can hi after
life. He never leaves the dam and
takes nourishment in small quantities,
avoiding a full meal, which would im
pede swift escape. In lying down no
attempt is made at concealment, and
when he stands his bead is held high.
These habits show that the animal's
ancestors spent their lives in the open
and not in the forests and that they
were great travelers.
The calf, on the contrary, fills him
self with milk and is a poor traveler.
When danger approaches his first im
pulse is to conceal himself. He holds
his head low in order to look under
the branches of the forest. All his
characteristics point to the fact that
the ancestral home of cattle was in a
moist, wooded country, while the
primeval horse roamed the plains.—
London Chronicle.
A Chinese Solomon.
Two Chinamen, brothers, well ad
vanced In age, quarreled over a piece
of land which they had jointly inherit
ed from their father and went to law.
The native magistrate heard the testi
mony on both sides and determined
that both were wrong and both right,
according to the different points of
view. Therefore, instead of rendering
a judgment in favor of either, he order
ed that both be locked up In a cangue
with their heads fastened face to
face and kept there until they settled
their quarrel. The cangue is a sort of
cage in which prisoners are placed
with their necks locked Into a hole in a
board. It resembles somewhat the
stocks which were used for the punish
ment of malefactors In olden times.
When the brothers were placed In the
cangue, they were both very stubborn
and indignant, but toward the end of
the second day they began to weaken
and on the third day reached a satis
factory settlement and were released.
Costly In Human Lives.
In ancient times the great engineer-
Ing works were costly in human lives.
The making of the Red sea canal is
said to have involved the loss of no
fewer than 120,000 Egyptians. Buc
kle's examination made him believe the
number to have been somewhat exag
gerated, but he gives It as still a guide
to the enormous waste of human life
in those days. The men who kept 2,000
slaves engaged for three years bring
ing a single stone from Elephan
tine to the pyramids did not care a
great deal so long as In the twenty
years in which one of the pyramids
was building there were forthcoming
the 360,000 men required for the work.

AN INSECT PLAGUE.
The Mosquitoes That Infest the Region
of Laks Nyassu.
In his book "From the Cape to
Cairo" E. S. Srogan writes: "The
Kungu fly, which is peculiar to Lake
Nyassu, resembles small May flies,
and at certain seasons of the year they
rise from the water in such stupendous
clouds that they blot out the whole
horizon. Seen In the distance they
have exactly the appearance of a rain
storm coming across the lake. When
they are blown landward they make
every place uninhabitable by the
stench which arises from the countless
millions that lodge and die on every
inch of sheltered ground. I myself
have seen them lying a foot deep in
a room, and I was told that they are
often much worse. The natives sweep
them up and make cakes of them.
"Biting and poisonous ants are an
other pest, but the mosquito is the
great enemy of man. It was abso
lutely necessary to turn hi half an
hour before sunset and to make all
the preparations for the night I piled
all my belongings round the edge of
my net and kept a green wood fire
burning at each end, and then I lay
inside, smoked the native tobacco and
prayed for morning. As soon as the
sun went down the mosquitoes started
operations.
"It was like having a tame whirl
wind in one's tent. They could not
possibly have been worse. Every
night 200 or 300 contrived to enter my
net— l have no idea how. The most
pernicious and poisonous kind was a
very small black mosquito that might
possibly have penetrated the mesh. I
used to turn out in the morning per
fectly dazed from the amount of poi
son that had been injected during the
night"
CUNNING OF MUSKRATS.
Foresight With Whioh These Animals
Build Winter Homes.
In the month of March, before the
rivers have opened, on the snow around
the heads of the creeks and about the
airholes in the thick ice may be seen
the curious Jrail of the muskrat It
can readily be recognized by the firmly
planted footmarks, heavily and slowly
Impressed, and the sharp after drag of
the long, scaly, bladelike tail. All
through the cold winter months these
heavily furred animals have lived
warm and comfortable In their well
constructed houses, rearing their third
and last litter. One house erected
about September seemed planned with
aimost human foresight Here, with
their long sharp teeth and strong, inch
long claws, they had cut and cleared
wide paths through all the marshes
paths so deep that three feet of Ice did
not close them, so wide that we have
often paddled along them, marveling
at the great floating masses of torn up
aquatic vegetation. These paths were
a hundred yards long and four feet
wide and were cut through a mass of
tangled cover high enough In most
places to thoroughly conceal a duck
hunter and his canoe. In the winter
months the muskrats can easily dive
from their houses Into these under ice
channels, and the whole marsh is be
fore them to choose their meal from.
The long yellow roots of the flag and
the juicy tubers of the wild onion (the
muskrat apple is the more poetic Ojib
way) hang exposed before them or are
readily torn out.— Bonnycastle Dale In
Outing Magazine.
The American Sailor.
It U related of Commodore Decatur
that after he had tamed the Barbary
powers, whose energies had been re
awakened while the war of 1812 kept
our navy busy, he set out In his flag
ship, the Guerriere, to make his way
across the Mediterranean unattended
and suddenly found himself In the
midst of one of the corsair fleets which
had remained in a neutral port during
hostilities. The situation looked rather
squally. The corsair admiral hailed,
"What sheep is dat?" "The United
States ship Guerriere, Commodore De
catur," was the reply. "Where you
going?" was the next question. "Where
I please!" thundered Decatur through
the speaking trumpet, and the Guer
riere proceeded unmolested. — Boston

Comedy In a Back Street.
About 10 o'clock one morning two
men met and began threatening and
culling each other names. One finally
called the other a liar, and the two
men were about to grapple when a
woman opened the door and said,
"Gentlemen, are you about to fight?"
"We are!" they answered together.
Then have the kindness to wait a
moment," she continued. "My hus
band has been sick for weeks and is
now Just able to sit up. He is very
downhearted this morning, and If
you'll only wait till I can draw him
up to the window I know he'll be very
grateful to both of you."
She disappeared into the house, and
after ona look into each other's face
the men smiled, shook hands and de
parted together.— London Telegraph.
They All Thouflht About Alike.
Three "tired" citizens— a lawyer, a
doctor and a newspaper man— sat in a
back room in the gray light of the
early dawn. On the table were many
empty bottles and a couple of packs
of cards. As they sat in silence a
rat scurried across the hearth Into
the darkness beyond. The three men
shifted their feet and looked at each
other uneasily. After a long pause
the lawyer spoke. "I know what yon
