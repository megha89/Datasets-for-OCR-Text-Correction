JACKSON, AMADOU COUNTY. CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. JULY, 10, 1903.
NAPOLEON'S FOLLIES.
The Climax Came With the Senseless
liiyuslon of Russia.
Of all Napoleon's Insanities, for they
were nothing less, the climax was the
invasion of Russia. What motive can
he have had for this, saving delirious
ambition, and, what was also undoubt
edly strong in him, sheer love of the
bloody game of war? He evidenly
reckoned on encountering the Russian
army of defense nearer the frontier,
Winning an Austerlitz or a Jena, dictat
ing terms as he had dictated them to
Austria or Prussia, and returning to
Paris in triumph. He was deceived in
the character of his enemy. He tried
in vaiu to force a battle at Smolcnsko.
The Russians instead of fighting him
near the frontier retreated before him,
gave up their country to his ravages,
compelled him to make a march in
which' he lost a great part of his enor
mous host and after handling him
very severely at Borodino evacuated
Moscow, leaving it In*- flames. They
then refused to treat with him. He
had ■ consequently to decamp without
having provided for retreat or subsist
ence. He lost almost his entire army
in the wintry wastes and but for the
extraordinary conduct of Kutusoff in
letting him and his guard pass unop
posed would himself have fallen into
the hands of the enemy. This error
was on a far more Imposing scale and
more tragical than any blunder of
Beaulieu or Mack. But was It less of
a blunder or less of a detraction from
the reputation of the man of action or
even from that of the commander? It
is frightful to think what power a
despot has for evil. There was prob
ably not a soul on either side, saving
Napoleon himself, who desired the
Russian expedition.— Gold win Smith In
Atlantic.
The Green Sea.
There is no sea to which the name
green sea is applied'in topography, but
the term is used as descriptive of parts
of the ocean with appropriate signifi
cance.
Where the gulf stream is deflected
from Newfoundland toward the Azores
is the Sargasso sea, the surface of
which is a mass of floating seaweed.
Its popular nnnie among sailors is the
Green sea nowadays, and In earlier
times it was noticed with astonishment
by Columbus and his sailors, while its
weed clad waters were called by others
the seaweed meadows.
A part of the Persian gulf is also
known by this name on account of 8
remarkable strip of vividly green wa
ter which is seen along the Arabian
coast
Many other large tracts of the ocean
assume this distinctive tint, which may
be due either to the presence of multi
tudes of microscopic plants or living
atoms or to the depth or density or
saltness of the water itself.
Why Her Dancing; Dragged.
An athletic young man, with a fine,
strong physique, danced with a young
woman of some 200 pounds in a village
not far west of Rahway, N. J. He no
flped that the dancing was uphill work
and wiieii It was over sank into a chaif
in the Incipient stages of exhaustion.
The young woman looked thoughtfully
across the shining surface of the floor
and threw a glance of investigation at
the corner where the punch bowl stood.
"Doesn't it strike you that the floor Is
very sticky tonight?" she inquired.
The young man gallantly denied
thinking so.
"It seems so to me," the young wo
man observed. Then she looked down
at her foot, protruding from a silken
flounce, and exclaimed:
"Why, J'va goj my rubbers on!"—

Defining: a. "Crab."
The old story of the Frenchmen who
were making a dictionary and defined
crab as "a small red fish that walks
backward" illustrates the need of ex
act knowledge. Cuvler said tbe defini
tion was excellent, only that the crab,
was not a fish, was not red and did not
walk backward.
The Mind.
Unreflective minds possess thoughts
only as a Jug does water, by containing
them. In a disciplined mind knowledge
exists like vital force in the physical
frame, ready to be directed to tongue,
or hand, or foot hither, thither, any
where, and for any use desired.

SPEECHES THAT LIVE.
Oratorlc Triumphs That Stand the
Test of Rending?'
Tt is often said that if a speech reads
well it is not a good speech. There
may be some truth in if The reader
cannot, of course, get the impression
which the speaker convoys by look and
tone and gesture. He lacks that mar
veloi\s.influence by which in a. great
assembly the emotion of every individ
ual soul 13 multiplied by the emotion of
every other. The renOrr can pause and
dwell upon the thought. If there be a
fallacy, he is. not hurried away to do
something rise before he can detect it
So, also, his more careful and deliber
ate criticism will discover offenses of
style and taste which pass unheeded in
a speech when uttered. But still the
great oratorlc triumphs of literature
and history stand the test of reading In
the closet as well as of hearing in the
assembly. Would not Mark Antony's
speech over the dead body of Csesnr.
had it been uttered, hay« moved tLfe
Roman populace as it moves the spec
tator when the play is acted or the sol
itary reader in his closet? Does not
Lord Chatham's "I rejoice that Amer
ica has resisted" reads well? Do not
Sheridan's and Burkes great perora
tions in the impeachment of Warrrn
Hastings read well? Does not "Liber'y
and union, now and forever," read
well? Does not "Give me liberty or
give me death" read well ? .> Do not Ev
erett's finest passages read well?— Se

LITTLE BARBADOS.
fhe Island Contains About tse
Proudest People on Earth.
None of the great nations of the
earth is half so proud of itself as the
jlttle colony of Barbados, a mere speck
in the Caribbean, which calls Itself
"the little England of the tropics."
Alone of all England's West Indian
isles, Barbados has belonged to Eng
land ever since It was first colonized
by white men. It has never been con
quered by the enemy, as the others
have been. This fact ' naturally gives
the Barbadians a good conceit of them
selves and indeed makes them Juat
about the proudest people on earth.
When just before the Crimean wai
England wns hesitating whether she
should attack Russia the Barbadians
sent this message to the cabinet:
"Go ahead. Don't be afraid. Barba
dos is behind you."
King George was offered an asylum
by "little England" when Napoleon
Bonaparte proposed to Invade Eng
land.
"If you were driven from England,"
the Barbadians wrote, "come here. You
will be safe with us to protect you."
When England was suffering hei
worst reverses in South Africa the
Barbadians were not worried. They
knew that if matters really reached a
crisis "Barbados would go In and finish
the business," as one of their newspa
pers seriously put It.

MASTERS OF MUSIC.
THE GREAT COMPOSERS AND THEIR
PECULIAR METHODS OF WORK.
Eccentric Habits, as a Rule, Are
Linked Wltli This Phase of Genius.
llnjrtn'a Dress Suit and Sapphire
' ninsr and Deethoven'* Wild Walks.
All the great musical composers had
their own peculiar ideas and manner
ef working. They had their peculiar
traits, their moods, their eccentric hab
its, such as are generally said to mark
the genius. In "Musical Education" M.
Larignnc tells of their peculiarities.
"Haydn was a very early riser," he
write*, "and yet he never worked ex
cept In full' dress, in which he was
like He began by shaving
himself carefully, - powdered himself
and ||ut on his finger a certain ring, a
sapphire, j 1 believe, . surrounded with
brilliants, which; had been given him
by .too; great Frederick, unless it was
Prince Esterhazy. That done,' be shut
himself up in a quiet room and wrote
for several consecutive hours, five or
blx, without stopping.
"Mozart, the gentle and pious Mo
zart, was sometimes less particular,
and composed a little everywhere and
under all conditions. Happily the
ideas came often enough and pursued
him even into the restaurants of Vien
na, Prague and Munich, where he was
very fond of playing billiards and
smoking a pipe and composing in his
bead.
"Rossini composed almost constantly
and In all ways, rarely at the piano,
most often In the evening or at night,
and, like Mozart, often found Inspira
tion in a carriage or post chaise. In
the Irregular Joltings of these vehicles
he perceived rhythm, and of these
rhythms melodies were born. There is
no doubt that he would have found
them in the trepidation of the railroad
if he had dared to try, but he had such
a dread of this mode of locomotion that
no one was ever able to induce him to
set foot In a car.
"Gluck composed violently gesticu
lating, walking up and down and act
ing all his characters, often in the open
air, on the lawn, In a garden.
"Beethoven also undoubtedly found
a powerful auxiliary to Inspiration in
motion and walking. Whatever the
season, every day after dinner, which
was at 1 o'clock, according to the Vien
nese custom, he set out for a walk,
and with big strides twice made the
circuit of the city of Vienna. Neither
cold nor heat nor rain nor hail was able
to stop him. Then it was that his heat
of fancy attained its full ardor. He
would enter a restaurant, sit down for
an instant and ask the stupefied waiter
for the bill, without having brderSb
anything. His clumsiness was pro
digious. He usually broke everything
he touched. Not a single piece of fur
niture In his house, and any article of
value less than anything else, was safe
from his attacks, and many times his
ink pot fell into the piano by which he
was working, which, religiously pre
served in 'the museum at Bonn, still
retains its Indelible traces. Although
he had always lived in the midst of the
high Viennese aristocracy, in .which
drawing room dances were Jield in
high honor, he never succeeded In danc
ing in time. -'■<■•
1 "Herold composed while walking,
humming or singing, often in the
Champs Elysees, and often passed his
best friends by without recognizing
them.
"Gounod composed especially at the
table, or at least In his bead. When he
Wrote, everything was absolutely clear
in his brain. His manuscripts prov%
this.
"Wagner liked to write standing up
before a large table desk like the cash
desks In the shops. His scores were
written without erasures, in a superb
calligraphic hand, admirable for Its
clearness and firmness and worthy of
a professional copyist.
"Berlioz, who played no instruments
but the' guitar, flute and flageolet, nec
essarily worked at the table.
"Franck, who was the head \of a
school, scarcely composed at all till
after ft o'clock in the evening, ; ;•■*-;'.
"Meyerbeer wrote In a regular man
ner In the evening, and his servant bad
orders to drag him away from the
piano at the stroke of midnight Schu
mann would not admit that any one
could write otherwise than at a table.
Mendelssohn made much use of the
piano and preferred to work in the
morning. Auber generally worked at
night and very late, till 2 or 3 o'clock
in the morning, In order to avoid out
side noises.
"Halevy had a table piano that had
been made for him by Pleyel. From
time to time he would draw out his key
board, strike a few chords on it, and
then push it back like a simple drawer
and continue to write.
"Boieidleu also wrote at the piano.
Felicien David, not being much of a
pianist, sometimes sought the aid of
his violin. Adolpbe Adam almost al
ways worked at his grand piano, the
right hand side of whose keyboard
was stained with Innumerable splashes
of ink. He played eight ten or twelve
bars, a.nd then wrote them down. Bizet
worked especially In the evening and
still more at night; he often made use
of a piano bureau by Pleyel, like Gou
nod and Halevy."
His Gncit,
"Where were they married?"
"I ain't jest sure," answered the
small boy, " 'cause they left me home,
but I guess it. was in the steeple."
"In the steeple?"
"Well, I heard 'em say it was a high
church wedding."— Chicago Post.

AN IMPUDENT BEGGAR.
How Sir Walter Besant Was Cured
of Promiscuous Alntsarl-rlnar.
It was one of the dally customs ol
Sir Walter Besant to take a wali
through Hyde park, London. At the
entrance to the park sat an old beggai
woman whose woebegone appearanc<
caused Sir Walter to stop one day and
drop a copper penny Into her out
stretched hand. After a time It be
came a regular habit to speak a word
Ir two to her when giving her the coin
One day, however, the old woman
handed him back the penny, sayingi
"Guv me siller or nawthlnk. The Idea
of a gent like you givln' a poor old wo
man like me a dirty penny 1 Guv me
siller."
She came close to him and waved hei
arms threateningly. Sir Walter started
to go, but she grabbed the lapel of his
coat and screamed: "Guv me siller, yon
rascally rogue! Guv me what you ow«
me!"
This drew a crowd, and- the novelist
to save himself threw a handful of
coin among them and during the
scramble escaped.
He forgot all about the old hag till
one day, chancing to enter the sam«
gate again, he was aroused from a
reverie by her shrill cackle. Pointing
him out ,to the bystanders, she
screamed, "That's 'im— the fine rogue
In the long whiskers— the bloke in the
'igh "at!"
This was too much for the author.
He broke away with extraordinary
baste and thereafter was pretty thor
oughly cured of promiscuous almsgiv
ing.
Watching a Spider at Work.
Watch a spider spin his web, and I
shall be surprised if you ever kill a
spider again. It takes him about an
hour, somewhat less, for he is a mar
velously quick worker, and there is
someching almost terrifying about the
skill with which he works. There is
his body, no larger than a match's
head, yet inclosed within that mere
dot of nature, there is an intelligence
which is able first to prospect the area
for his web, then to plan it out like a
geometrician and then to carry out his
plan with workmanlike precision.
Meanwhile, too, it must be remember
ed, he is not only doing his thinking
and his weaving, but also spinning the
material for It, all In that mite of a
body. But perhaps the uncannlest fea
ture.of the whole thing is that the spi
der not merely has his plan dear in big
head, but knows when be has made
mistakes, and you can see him break
ing off misplaced' threads here and
there, making taut slack lines and se
curing shaky connections.—Success.
. An Inconvenient Piano.
Lepbld de Meyer of Dresden, a bril
liant and popular pianist of his day,
was once summoned to play before the
sultan at Constantinople. Going thith
er, .he borrowed a grand piano from
one of the Austrian secretaries of lega
tion and had It set up In a large recep
tion room at the palace. . There he
awaited the coming of the sultan, but
when that Intelligent monarch entered
the room he started back in alarm and
demanded of his attendants what that
monster was standing there on three
legs. -^i;:
Explanations followed, but were in
vain. The legs had to be taken off and
the body of the instrument laid flat on
the floor, and Leopold de Meyer, squat
ting cross legged on a mat went
through his programme as . best he
could in that awkward attitude and
without pedals. But the commander of
the faithful was delighted, and when
the last piece was playecl gave the art
ist over $0,000 as "backsheesh."
A Carved Cherry Stone.
Dr. Peter Oliver, who lived in Eng
land during the early part of the eight
eenth century, tells of seeing a carved
cherry stone which would be a wonder
even in this age of fine tools and fine
workmanship.
The stone was one from a common
Cherry, and upon it were carved the
heads of 124 popes, kings, queens, em
perors, saints, etc. Small as they must
necessarily have been, it is announced
on the I authority of Professor Oliver
that with a good glass the heads of
the popes and kings could readily be
distinguished from those of the queens
and saints by their miters and- crowns.
The gentleman who brought this little
wonder to England purchased it in
Prussia, allowing, the original owner
£5,000 for his treasure. Think of it—
$25,000 for a cherry seed!
A Spirit to Be Deplored.
Just where honorable Industry ends
and avaricious piling up of treasure
begins no one can take it upon himself
to say. The spirit however, that im
pels a young man to sacrifice all the
nobler aims of life in order to turn a
liberal competence into wealth too
great to be spent (and the giving away
of which, unless carefully regulated, Is
a doubtful good) is certainly to be de
plored.—Eliot Gregory in Century.
Bankrupt.
Solicitor— You want to be made bank
rupt, do you? Very well, I'll put it
ttoough for you. Just give me a check
for $100 on account of preliminary ex
penses.
Client— B-but I haven't got any mon
ey at all.
Solicitor— Then why the dickens do
you come to me? Hang it all, man, yoa
are bankrupt!

CHIN AW ARE i
THE AMERICAN' LAUGH.
It Is a Valuable Aid la Building Up
Our National Greatness.
God's greatest. gift to man was the
laugh. Without It the human race
would have wept Itself to death or ex
terminated itself long ago. Pathos Is
beautiful; tragedy. Is absorbing. But
both pathos and tragedy are Instantly
routed by the laugh. -
Laughter has sunshine in It. . It Is
Warm. Learned men have searched
for the secret of life. What Is it but
good humor? That's the secret of life
being worth living.
What Bunehine Is to earth good hu
mor Is to man. Take the smile and
the laugh away, and it would be the
end of man.
Men can't fight while they enjoy a
Joke. Death himself recoils from the
laugh. The man in a good humor has
an enormous advantage over the man
who Is angry. Anger Is dark. Bitter
ness Is filled with shadow. Intoler
ance Is grim and black. Prejudice is
blind.
Good humor, with the smile and the
laugh, is sunshine In which objects are
plain and distortion disappears and
wherein phantoms become nothing.
One reason for America's greatness Is
that, above all, it is a nation that
laughs. There have been gay peoples
and frivolous nations, but gayety and
frivolity, are strangely akin to melan
choly. That gay Germany whose na
tional happiness is expressed in song
is clouded by- melancholy.. Sadness
pervades the temperament of Germa
nla.
And frivolous France— how tragic
she becomes— how desperately tragic!
Tbe great American laugh is another
thing. Investigate the American na
tional laugh, and there's a sound, prac
tical something behind it. It is never a
forced laugh. It is healthy, vigorous,
spontaneous.
Empires and powers have crumbled
and gone to pieces In solemn serious
ness and gloomy grandeur, while Uncle
Sam, with a joke on his lips, forges
ahead.— Denver Post.

Easter In Russia.
Easter In Russia is the greatest festi
val of the year. Russian Christmas
presents are as nothing compared to
those given at Easter. Eggs are of
course the principal feature, and not
till one has seen the Easter bazaar in
the GosOnoi Door and the shops on the
Nevsky Prospect is it easy to imagine
the beauty and daintiness of Easter
productions. Fortunes in trinkets,
laces and jewels are spent on the con
tents of the eggs.
A very pretty, egg is made of pink
veined marble rimmed with gold.
Small ivory eggs filled with silver ro
sary beads make a lovely offering for
the devout church woman, and for the
practical housewife a little rush bas
ket full of fresh eggs is wonderfully
attractive.
A Voracious Monster.
The most voracious of all marine
beasts of prey Is the orca or killer
whale. It reaches a length of twenty
five feet, and • Its jaws bristle with
teeth from four to six inches long and
us sharp as a dirk knife. Its digestive
power Is proportioned to the tremen
dous efficacy of its jaws. It seems also
to be an atrocious glutton, as one speci
men examined contained in its stomach
thirteen porpoises and fourteen seals.

"What reason have you for thinking
that the defendant was Intoxicated?'

Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription gives

"I suffered for five years with inflammation
which caused violent pain and often torture so
bad at times that I could not be about to attend
to my dally duties," writes Mrs. Julius C Bell,
of Bathroad, Kingston, Ont. "Life was simply
misery to me and I did not know which way to
turn tor relief. Had tried doctors but found
they did not help me. My druggist advised me
to try Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription— eulo-
gizing it in glowing terms. I decided to give it
a trial and brought a bottle home. lam happy
to say that after the use of the first bottle I felt
so much improved I decided to take another and
after that a third bottle. I have good reasons to
be pleased, for I am to-day a well woman, work

COUNTY GOVERNMENT ACT
SUSTAINED.
The supreme court has just ren-
J dered a decision affirming the con
' stitutionality'o| the county govern
■;-' ment act of 1901. Some of our ex
:. changes are laboring under the im
<• pression that it-relates to the new
V- county governmeut act passed by
! the last legislature, and which is now
being tested in the superior court of
■ Amador county. The truth is, the
' ■ opinion just given by the supreme
-: court has no bearing whatever on
."the issue in which this count}' is in
- terested, and which is now pending
♦in the courts. The point raised
■ against the law of 1901 was that the
' act did not conform to constitutional
• requirements. The act of that year
Scut down the salaries of constables
and other officials in San Joaquin
The officials affected re
-fused to accept the lower salaries,
applied for writ of mandate to
i compel the auditor to issue warrants
"in conformity with the old law. The
was carried to the highest
J court, which has just decided against
%the officials. The issue before the
i: Amador court is entirely different,
namely, whether justices and con-
I/stablesI '/stables can demand increased com
pensation for services under a law
■passed during their term of office.
:.The state constitution says nothing
"against the lowering of salaries. It
- may appear unjust that the emolu
ments of office should be reduced
after a man has been elected. The
constitution, however, sets forth
certain reserved rights of the peo
ple, some things "which the legis
lature'shall not do. It is silent
about lowering salaries, and hence
the courts have declared that the
legislature has control over the mat
ter. On the other hand the supreme
law of the state is very emphatic in
withholding from the legislative
body the power to increase compen
sation of elective officers — whether
state, county, or township — during
the term for which they were elected.
The last legislature attempted to do
this. A quibble has ' been raised
against this way of putting the case.
It is claimed that the law merely
changes the manner of compensation
from fees to salary. This is a very
small hole to try to crawl out of.
The officials concerned want to draw
salary under the new law for no
other reason than that it holds out
increased pay. They may twist and
wiggle as they please, that is what
they are fighting for.
A GOOD MOVE.
At the meeting of the board of
supervisors held this, week the dis
trict attorney took action in regard
to road work authorized by the
supervisors, the cost of which ex
ceeds $300, which is likely to put a
stop to the practice which has been
followed in this county for a number
of years. »-The present law makes it
mandatory to let out all work in ex
cess of by contract, after ad
vertising for bids. The law in sub
stantially the same form has existed
for years except that the last legis
lature took the matter entirely out
side of the discretion of the super
visors, making it obligatory upon
them to advertise for bids for road
work estimated to cost $300 or over.
It may be stated that nearly all the
work done on the lone road will
come within this provision. But
the contract system has been en
tirely ignored. The individual sup
ervisors have ordered the work done
regardless of this limitation upon
their authority. The Ledger has
repeatedly called attention to this
matter, and also to other phases of
road management that might be
changed with advantage to the pub
lic interests. During the past
month a portion of the lone road
has been subjected to the oil treat
ment. This work was done, as all
other work has been performed for
years past, without putting it up to
public competition by advertising
for proposals. The bills came in for
allowance before the board this
week, and the cost of this improve
ment was far in excess of the $300
limit. The district attorney there
upon took a decided stand, and
stated that the law had been violated
in this respect for a long time, and
that hereafter he would allow no
more bills of this kiud. They were
required to let the work by contract,
and persistence in disregarding this
provision had already caused com
ment, and sooner or later was bound
to give trouble. The district attor
ney has charge of this question. It
is his duty to look over the bills be
fore being allowed, and mark them
legal or otherwise according to his
judgment. A road bill branded by
him as an illegal claLn would not be
paid by the treasurer, even if it
were passed rby the supervisors.
The action of Attorney Vi
cini therefore brings this branch of
the road question clearly in issue.
The stand he has taken in behalf of
strict compliance with a salutary
law, but a law which has been a
dead letter in this county for years,
will meet with approval by citizens
generally.- We trust it will lead to
the^ .correction also of that other
long-standing abuse of supprvisors
putting in lump claims in their own
names for road work done in their
respective districts. This is equally
against the law, and its discontinu
ance is only a question of time.
PROTEST AGAINST FOREST RES
ERVATION. , ;
Several citizens : of this county
went to Sacramento Tuesday to file
a protest against the continuance
of the temporary forest reservation
in this county, which was made
about six months ago, and by which
nearly all the timber lands of this
county were withdrawn from entry.
The western line of the reservation
extends nearly to Georgetown and
Placerville. A written protest
against this extreme reservation has
been signed quite generally. ' So far
as we can learn no resident of this
county is in favor of having such
large tracts reserved, although there
is not so much objection to reserva
tions in the higher altitudes where
the timber is not available for im
mediate use. A special agent of the
land department has been sent out
to hear the case, and a decision will
be reached later on. . ...
Our congressional representatives
should oppose this extensive "reser
vation, for it sets aside so large a
portion of the county that its busi
ness affairs would be seriously crip
pled. Supply and demand are the
best regulators of the timber. When
timber is needed it ought to be cut,
for it rots beyond a certain age. In
these Sierras the young timber is
growing again very rapidly, and
there will be trees again for the peo
ple of the future. A great deal of
alarm about the future is absurd.
When people searched the Arctic
ocean for whales, because they knew
nothing of kerosene or electricity, it
would have been argued that the
future might be dark if we neglected
to keep fat whales to make oil for
remote ages. We are getting along
all right without the whales, and
our descendants will live in ten times
the luxury that we possess with half
our effort — all of which may be very
bad for them.— Placerviile Republi
can.

This morning Judge Rust rendered
a decision is the case of James Mc-
Cauley, justice of the peace, vs. C. L.
Culbert, county auditor. This case
involves the right of justices and
constables elected last year to draw
salary — meaning increased compen
sation — under the new county gov
ernment act passed by the last legis
lature. The decision is lengthy, and
we must reserve its publication until
next week. The court holds the law
to.be constitutional, and that the
officials are entitled to pay under its
provisions. We trust the case will be
appealed. Its importance demands
that-it bo passed upon by the su
preme court.

There is more catarrh in this section
of the country than all other diseases
put together, and until the last few
years was supposed to be incurable.
For a great many years doctors pro
nounced it a local disease, and prescrib
ed local remedies, and by constantly
failing to cure with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable. Science has
proven catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti
tutional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
Cure, manufactured by F. J. Cheney
& Co., Toledo, Ohio, is the only consti
tutional cure on the market. It is taken
internally in doses from 10 drops to a
teaspoonful. It acts directly on the
blood and muscous surfaces of the sys
tem. They offer one hundred dollars
for any case it fails to cure. Send for
circulars and testimonials.

Amador county. The state officials
had noticed the appointment of Arditto
to look after the protection of game in
this county, and this led to the offer
of the appointment by the state au
thorities in conjunction therewith.
There is no salary attached to the posi
tion, but the officer receives $25 for
each prosecution for violation of the
gamo lavrs, no matter whether a con
viction is the outcome or not. Arditto
is inclined to accept the appointment.

sudden thud as the corner of the ve
hicle struck the ground. The horses
were not scared in the least, and did
not move more than a couple of yards
after the shock. The occupants of the

J. B. Tregloan, connected with the

cidently Me is working also for securing
a fair exhibit of Amador's mineral
products at the St.. Louis fair next
year. He has visited Volcano district,
and in fact all the regions to- the east
of Jackson. After a careful investiga
tion he expresses himself as surprised
at the mineral resources of that portion
of the county. It has not been given
a fair trial. It is not contended there
is anything that can compare with the
mother lode in that region, but the
multitude of smaller veins richly
freighted with gold, are deserving of
more attention than they have hither
to received, and the problem of whether
they descend to great depth is as yet
an unsolved one.
A Commendable Act.
According to notices published
around town, a special meeting of
Jackson Miners' Union was held Tues
day evening. The particular business
that called them together in special
session we are not prepared to state.
It is common report on the street, how
ever, that one of the prominent sub
jects of discussion was the so-called
"scab" notices which were posted
around town about six weeks ago.
Theso notices have created a great deal
of adverse criticism. They have also
caused not a little talk in the ranks of
the union members. There is a large
and growing element in the camp
averse to such rabid measures. They
realize that the safe course to pursue
in advancing the interests of organized
labor is to show a conservative and
conciliatory spirit, recognizing the
right of any citizen to join or decline
to join their order as he may see fit,
and that too without in any way sac
rificing his right to earn a living by
working in the mines. To try to bull
doze men into their organization by
threats of blacklisting, or labeling
them as "scabs," or refusing to work
with them, and all sucb extreme steps,
was looked upon as unwise, and calcu
lated to weaken the union by affixing
the seal of public condemnation. Hence
this wing endeavored to lead the local
order into paths of safety. With the
interests, not only of themselves, but
of the whole community at heart, they
desire to re-establish confidence among
mining investors by a fair and liberal
policy. Some time ago, we are in
formed, an effort was made to have the
"scab" proclamation rescinded and the
notices taken down. It did not succeed
entirely, but the day of grace was ex
tended for another month. This per
iod of extension has not more that half
expired. Encouraged by their partial
success, these workers having the true
interests of labor at heart, pressed for
ward in the good work. At the meet
ing this week, we are told, a resolution
was passed to rescind the "scab" proc
lamation. On Wednesday morning*
the printed notices, which have disfig
ured the bulletin boards and a number
of business premises in town, were re
moved. They were taken down in the
same manner as they were posted vp —
by official action. Tho Ledger is al
ways willing to give credit for a com
mendable act, and we do not hesitate
to. say that Jackson Union, by this
deliberate and well-timed proceeding,
has done much toward allaying that
apprehension in investment and busi
ness circles that has given such a
serious setback to the development of
our resources. Reason is again en
throned. We have no doubt this spirit
will continue in the ascendant.
No harm can come of a labor organi
zation if properly conducted, with a
due regard for the interests of the out
sider as well as the insider. Indeed,
much benefit will accrue to its mem
bfrs when so conducted. We hail this
latest move of the local union, as a
deliberate withdrawal from the path
mapped out when flushed with the idea
of newly discovered power, and a de
termination to exercise it to the limit.
In lieu thereof, the olive branch of
peace is extended. With this feeling
prevailing, the unrest should disappear
and the mining industry hereabouts be
prosecuted with increased energy.
Consolidation of Lumber Interests.
The lumber interests of Amador
county are being gradually absorbed
by ihe Amador Lumber Company.
The company has recently purchased
the stock of lumber in the Allen yard
in Sutter Creek. They have also se
cured a tract of land comprising five
acres near the Vicini hotel on Sutter
hill. Here they will establish a whole
sale lumber yard, from which lumber
will be distributed to all parts of the
county. Sheds are now in course of
construction, and teams are hauling
lumber from the mills at Tiger creek
to this point.
In Trouble at Sheepranch.
Steve Cassella, who is said to be an
Amador City man, is incarcerated in
Jail at San Andreas for a murderous
assault upon a miner named Jack Mor
ris at Sheepranch on Wednesday of
last week. Both men work in the
mine. They had a quarrel some weeks
before, in which Cassella was worsted.
Ho resolved on revenge. As Morris
was coming home from work on the
night shift on the morning in question,
he was met by Cassella, who struck
him twice over the head and once on
each arm with a bar of iron, with
which he bad armed himself for the
occasion. It was at first thought that
the skull was " fractured. -This fortun
ately proved incorrect. Cassella fled
after the occurrence and went to Stock
ton. He was arrested as he attempted
to leave the train on its arrival in that
city.
Catarrh of the Stomach.
When the stomach is overloaded;
when food is taken into it that fails to
digest, it decays and inflames the muc
ous membrane, exposing the nerves,
and causes tho glands to secret mucin,
instead of the natural juices of diges
tion. This is called Catarrh of the
Stomach. For years 1 suffered with
Catarrh of the Stomach, caused by in
digestion. Doctors and medicines failed
to benefit me until I used Kodol Dys
pepsia Cure.— J. R. Rhea, Coppell,

LOCAL MINING NEWS
Notes From Amador County Mines.
Kennedy Picking Up.
Kennedy — The clean-up at this
mine for last month was the heaviest
for many months. We are not in a
position to state the amount. Rumor
has it that it was something over
$40,000, the product of 70 stamps. This
is far better than the average yield for
the past two years.
Grand Prize. — This mine, tho
property of G. S. Andrews, Is situated
in Pioneer district, adjoining the Horn
mine. The first shipment of ore from
this claim took place this week, con
sisting of one car load, containing 13
tons. It was sent to Selby smelting
works. The ore came from below the
tunnel level. Mr. Andrews accom
panied the shipment in person.
Butte Basin.— W.E. Stewart in
forms us that work is to be started at
once on the Butte basin gravel claim.
The intention is to sink the shaft 40
feet deeper by means of a horse whim,
and prospect the gravel at that depth.
Work will be commenced early next
week. Rich prospects, ranging as high
as $6 to the pan, have been obtained
from this basin, and it is bolieved that
richer spots will be found below exist
ing works. Bedrock has never been
Del Monte. — The annual meeting
of stockholders was held in Jackson
July 6. The old board of directors
were elected for the ensuing term, as
follows: F. A. Voorheis, Geo. 1.,
Wright, Richard Webb, B. C. O'Neil.
and C. O'Neil. The tunnel is still in
the hardest kind or rock, and progress
is therefore slow. About 45 feet pro
gress has been made during the past
month, with 180 feet more to make be
fore reaching the point where it is ex
pected to encounter the ledge. It was
decided to discoutinue work on this
tunnel for the present, and crush some
300 tons of ore on the dump, should it
prove of paying quality. After this
work on the tunnel will no doubt be re
sumed.
Sand Pile Mme — Extensive works
are being, erected at tbis mine near
Forest Home. The material constitut
ing the mine consists of immense accu
mulations of tailings from the Plymouth
Consolidated mills. There are hun
dreds of thousands of tons of these
tailings. It is said that assays give a
value of from $2 to $3 per ton in gold.
With such a value, there certainly
ought to be some way of working them
at a profit. To this end D. Fricot is
now putting up works for their treat
ment by the cyanide process. He has
already spent thousands of dollars on
the plant, and th«re is much work to
be done bofore it gets in running order.
Defender— Situated about six miles
north of West Point, In Amador. Less
than four years ago F. B. Joyce began
with a ten-foot ■ hole and a working
bond, his first adventure in mining.
When about 80 feet deep the ore justi
fied a mill, and a second band one of
four stamps was put on, and with this
he took out $40,000 in sinking 300 feet,
and running levels each way about 150
feet, with no stoping. About 150 tons
were shipped to Selby, running from
$50 to $130. Now he has a new 10
stamp mill, and is running on reserves
above 300 feet, and will resume sinking.
Quite a burg has grown up at Defen
der. He has a store, teams, house-,
postoffice, and a schoolhouse used as a
church also. After the mill was built
the mine paid for itself, and with a
good profit. His success, starting with
a prospect, makes a good object lesson.

FOURTH IN JACKSON.
Baseball Game and Dance.
The fourth in Jackson passed off in
the quietest manner known for years.
There was nothing in the way of liter
ary exercises nor amusements of any
kind in town. Indeed, the day would
have passed off like any other day had
it not been for Frank Burgin, who,
seeing that the citizens were not dis
posed to take any action looking to the
regular observance of the day, ar
ranged a baseball game between the
Jewel Bourbons and the Lodi team.
Game was called in the afternoon, on
the new grounds on Dwyer's hill. It
drew a large crowd, not only of town
folks, but many from the surrounding
country. The outcome was a bad de
feat for the Jackson players. The
visitors proved themselves experienced
in this particular art, and won easily.
At the conclusion of the game the score
stood 15 to 4 in favor of Lodi.
In the evening a grand ball was given
in Love's hall, which was crowded to
its utmost capacity. Music for the day
and evening was furnished by the Jack
son band. Frank Burgin is entitled to
much credit for his efforts in catering
for the amusement of the public. At
great expense be has fitted up a base
ball ground close to the town lines; the
finest ground the boys have ever had
in this vicinity. Not only the players,
but the citizens generally ought to en
courage these efforts. And we are
pleased to state that they have shown
appreciation by liberal attendance at
the games which have been played.
Every step in the way of furnishing;
innocent and healthful amusement is a!
public benefit. It draws people here,
and the gathering of people leads to
the circulation of more or less money
among the business houses.
Another baseball game was played
on Sunday between the same teams,
which ended the same way, only more
so, the Lodis being victors with a score
of 19 to 5.

here in her professional capacity when
the smallpox epidemic was raging
three years ago. Mr. Moore was in
Jackson Tuesday, to gather up his
personal effects, and left for Campo
Seco Wednosday.
A Strike in Tuolumne County.
The miners affiliated with the West
ern Federation of Miners in Jamestown
district went out on strike last Friday,
because of the employment of a few
non-union miners. The strike involves
four mines— the Jumper, Golden Rule,
Santa Ysabel and App. These prop
erties employ about 300 men. They
embrace the principal working mines
of Tuolumne county. The union posted
up notices five weeks ago, similar to
the famous notices that were posted
throughout this county, stating that
all who failed to become members of
the union by a specified date would be
regarded as scabs. Seven men failed
to send in applications for membership.
One was employed at the Jumper, two
at Santa Ysabel, and four'at the App.
The union miners decided that they
would not work with them, and struck.
The strike means either of two things:
to force these men to join the union, or
force the mine owners to discharge
them. It is a clear cut issue of all
union or all non-union employes. The
outcome will be awaited with much
interest. It is a contest of vital im
portance as affecting not only the
mineral industry of the district par
ticularly concerned, but' of the entire
mother lode region.
Want Only One Union.
The Western Federation of Miners
is not at all pleased over the organiza
tion of the engineers and other em
ployes above ground in connection with
the mines of this county as a labor un
ion affiliated with American Federation
of Labor. There has been some feel
ing created thereby. The Western
Federation is anxious to get the engin
eers and other top men to join their or
ganization. These men, who have
already identified themselves with the
new organization, are contented with
their lot, and manifest no disposition
to change front. The friction, we are
told, has become quite acute at the
mines in Amador City district during
the past week. A representative of the
Western Federation acting under in
structions from headquarters, made an
effort to win them over to his
side. The engineers of the Keystone,
Bunker Hill and Fremont were waited
upon, and urged to join the Federation.
A letter from the secretary of the Den
ver headquarters was shown as author
ity for the move to bring them Into the
orthodox camp. The engineers, how
ever, do not appear to take kindly to
the invitation. They were very em
phatic in declaring their preference to
remain where they are. This latest
move has caused quite a stir, and is
likely to lead to trouble if pressed to
extremes.
We learn that the engineers have
been given twenty-one days to join the
Western Federation. A failure to join,
as things now stand, means a refusal
to work with those adhering to the
.American federation. Three weeks,
however, will afford ample time for re
flection*, aad the sober second thought
to gain supremacy.

iasm and patriotism. The forenoon
exercises were under the direction of
the young ladies, who deserve much
credit for the able manner in which
their part of the program was carried
out. They had the town hall gaily
decorated with flags, bunting and ever
greens, and the literary exercises, con
sisting of singing of the national airs,
reading of the declaration of independ
ence, and -a patriotic address by Miss
Anna Jennings, followed by singing
"America" by the entire crowd, con
cluded the forenoon exercise.
The afternoon program started with

NOTES OF THK DAY.
The main feature of the racing pro
gram was a "catch as catch can" sprint
between "Peanuts" Harden of Amador
and F." Giannini of Drytown. Good
time was made, but Giannini "wasn't
in it." The race was witnessed by only
a few of the best of us.
A heavy-weight Austrian stepped on
F. LeMoin's toe while in the married
men's race, and now Fred is nursing
the sore member.
Jimmy Johnnie and Dick Allen came
from Amador to help swell the crowd.
The names of John S. Davis and T.
Honeychurch have been stricken from
the roll for not being present.
Eddie Giannini led for a while in the
blue rock shoot, but was taken with a
bad spell of rattles and allowed A.
Grainger to take the five dollar prize.
Dan Bona left his shooting eye at
home in his game bag.
The trotting race, that was to be,
between LeMoin's "Brewster," Mc-
Wayne's "Black Pete" and Carley's
"Nellie" was declared off on account of
Carley's mare being over trained.
George Jennings is a pretty fast
sprinter for a short distance.
I didn't witness the baseball game
but was told that the score was 82 to
something, in favor of the Amador's.
They say that Geo. Wicks is a good
fielder, but the Amador's 3ent all kinds
of flies to him, such as blow-flies, horse
flies, Texas-flies, etc., but he was al
ways after butter-flies. H A Seed.

Popular Young People Wed.
On Wednesday evening, July Bth,
Bon. K. Breesc of Oakland and Miss
Elizabeth Mabel Wheeler were mar
ried at the home of the bride's parents
on their farm two miles east of Ply
mouth. Rev. S. H. Phillips performed
the ceremony in the presence of sixty
relatives and invited guests.
The sweet strains of Mendelshon's
wedding march ushered the : bride,
leaning upon the arm of her father,
into the spacious family sitting ; room,
where she was met by the groom. In
a few well chosen words Rev. Phillips
pronounced them man and wife.
U. G. Spagnoli, a life-long friend of
the groom, and Miss Mamie Wheeler,
sister of the bride, stood up with the
couple mutually and silently pledging
the hearts of the true friend and sister.
A lover of nature has said that "if a
man is wise he is born and reared in
the country. " It is equally true, "if a
woman is beautiful she is born and
reared in the country. ' ' This from a
friend tells it all: columns, describing
a beautiful dress, a pretty bride or a
handsome groom, would be unnecessary
and out of place.
After the ceremony was performed
all present sat down to a bountiful
wedding supper prepared by the bride's
sisters, and an hour or more was spent
in good cheer amid mirth and joy. At
midnight Mr. and Mrs. Breese took
their departure from the old home
stead of the bride. They were driven
to Latrobe, from which place the train
was taken for Lake Tahoe, where two
weeks' honeymoon will be spent, after
which they will return to Oakland
their future home. Many useful and
beautiful presents were received. It
could not be otherwise. True friends
are never forgotten.
Bonny Breese, as be is known by
every man, woman and child in Ama
dor county, is the pride of our people,
and his conduct through life has de
servingly earned the esteem in which
he is held. He is the oldest child and
the only son of the late Raymond
Breese, who died ten years ago while
serving as county clerk. His ability
and force of character were recognized
by his father's successor, C. L. Culbert
the present county clerk. Although of
opposite political views, Bon was given
a clerkship in the office and when he
reached his majority he was appointed
chief deputy, which position he has
since held, until a year ago, when he
resigned his office to accept a position
as accountant in the Central Bank in
Oakland, which place he now holds,
and is as much . a favorite with his
employers and associates in Oakland
as he was in Amador county. During ail
these years Bon supported and cared
for the loved ones dependent on him,
and educated his sisters as well, thus
enabling them to earn their own living
and assist in building up a home for
their mother. This duty faithfully
discharged another pleasant step in
life is taken and prompts tbis pleasing
story of a true and faithful son and
brother, and last but not least, a lov
ing husband.
The bride is one of Amador's popular
native daughters, and has been a suc
cessful teacher in our public schools.
She too has a host of loving and ad
miring friends — the most enduring
recognition of amiability of character
and womanly ways. *
A Surgical Operation
is always dangerous— do not submit to
the surgeon's knife until you have tried
DeWitt's Witch Hazel Salve. It will
cure when everything else fails— it has
done this in thousands of cases. Here
is one of them: I suffered from bleed
ing and protruding piles for twenty
years. Was treated by different spec
ialists and used many remedies, but ob
tained no relief until I used DeWitt's
Witch Hazel Salve. Two boxes of this
salve cured me eighteen months ago,
and I have not bad a touch of the piles
since. —H. A. Tisdale, Summerton,

TRAINING A LION.
A DartnsT Performance That Had at
Very Simple Explanation.
Not long ago a lion tamer who was
sxhibitlng in a German circus in Hol
land attracted immense crowds at ev
ery performance by doing what seemed
to be "the most daring of acts in the
lions' cage. He would climb into the
cage with great pieces of meat and
throw it to the roaring beasts. The
moment they had leaped upon it he
would spring among them and put his
foot on it. The animals would growl
furiously, and then, just as the specta
tors were all waiting breathlessly, ex
pecting that the beasts would tear him
to pieces, they would shrink back,
cowed. After be had repeated -this ex
citing act for many days an English
man made a wager with him for a big
sum of money that he would not dare
to do it after the lions had been starved
for three days. The trainer considered
for a moment and then accepted the
wager, making only the condition that
he be allowed to have three weeks of
preparation.
At the end of three weeks the trainer
announced that he was ready, and the
process of starving the lions began.
The Englishman kept guards posted
around the cage day and n)ght to make
certain that not a morsel of food should
be given to the animals. At the expira
tion of the three days all Amsterdam
rushed to the circus. The lions were
maddened with hunger,, as any one
could see and hear, for they roared
continually, and their attempts to
break through the bars showed how
angry they had become. In the height
of the uproar the trainer entered the
cage with an immense piece of beef in
his arms. He tossed it on the floor of
the cage, raised his whip and, 10, not
one lion dared to approach it. The
mighty brutes lay crouched, roaring
and growling so hard that their great
frames shook, and each kept his ter
rific yellow eyes fixed hungrily on the
meat. But not one of them stirred.
The trainer stooped, lifted the beef
and tossed it to them again, and in a
moment the lions were in a great
tawny ball, rending and snarling and
tearing, with blood from the mangled
beef spurting all over the cage. The
Englishman paid his bet and then tried
to find out how the lion tamer had ac
quired such wonderful control over his
beasts. At first the man would not
tell, but at last he consented to ex
plain it. During the three weeks' pe
riod of preparation he had always
starved the lions from the very begin
ning. Then, on the fourth day, he
would enter the cage with a piece of
beef which had been soaked in kero
sene oil. The lions would no "sooner
pounce upon it than they would shrink
away, sickened by the ' stench. Then
he would throw them a fresh and good
piece of beef, which they would devour
In a moment. The lions soon became
so accustomed to expecting that the first
piece of beef that was thrown to them
was not good that at the end of three
days they would not even move from
their corners when the trainer threw it
on the floor of the cage. They would
not try to eat anything except the sec
ond piece. So the daring trick had a
very simple explanation.— Washington
Post.
A Teat of Reflnement.
The truest test of refinement is a
uniform regard for the welfare and
Interests and feelings of others. There
Is a refinement which is by education,
but in each case the sure indications
of refinement are the same. You cau
recognize the difference between those
who have and those who lack refine
ment by their bearing in a crowd. In
deed this difference is easier perceived
in a street car or in a. market or in a
thronged highway than in a drawing
room. A person of true refinement
takes up the less room and claims the
less concession and is readier to yield
position than an unrefined person. The
way in which a man carries a cane or
umbrella in a crowd settles the ques
tion in his case. And again the keeping
of one's market basket in the way, or
out of it, as at the busiest market ho'ir,
is an infallible test of the bearer's in
ner grain. And so in many other minor
matters.— Philadelphia Ledger.
Silk Culture In Italy.
About 600 A. I>. Persian monks first
brought silkworm eggs concealed in
the head of a hollow staff to Constan
tinople. Thence silk culture spread in
to Greece. A little later conquest car
ried it to Sicily. From there to Italy
it was but a step. Soil, climate, peo
ple suited it. The Industry took root,
grew, throve and continues to this day.
The thrifty peasant • manages to get
silk and oil and wine from the same
small holding. First he plants his mul
berry trees, sixteen feet each way;
next he prunes the heads Into a hollow
cup and trains his vines all over them,
and finally around the edge he sets a
shelter of olive trees. So all seasons
bring him labor and the reward of it
Forgotten, bat Not Lost.
"My dear," said Hr. Pewnyhub, ven
turing to put in a word as she paused
for breath, "may I ask what you are
scolding about?"
"I can't remember It Just now," re
plied his irate spouse. ''You've driven
it out of my head. But If I hadn't a
good reason for it do you suppose I'd
be as mad as I am?"
And she broke loose again.— Chicago
Tribune.

BRIDAL PHOTOGRAPHS.
Not Nearly So Many Taken Nowa-
days sa There Used to Be.
Brides are probably just as beautiful
now as ever they were, but they are
not nearly so anxious to record their
postnuptial loveliness by means of pho
tographs. Most photographers say they
are glad of it.
"I never did enjoy taking the pictures
of brides," said a photographer. "Like
ell the rest of the world, I love the dear
creatures, but when it cornea down to
$4 n dozen commercialism tney do not
satisfy my artistic instincts. Few brides
take a good picture. Somehow their
togs are not becoming. A bride is sup
posed to iook superlatively lovely on
her wedding day, but if anybody dared
to tell the truth on the subject that su
perstition soon would be exploded and
the sweet things would realize that, in
stead of looking their best on that oc
casion, most of them are apt to look
their worst. It is the same way when
they come to be photographed In their
wedding finery. They are either too
pale or too red, and they have a nerv
ous, anxious expression that robs the
face of all good lines for photographic
purposes.
"The time was when no bride consid
ered herself really married until she
had arrayed herself in spotless white
and had her picture taken. Generally
'he' came with her, and 'he' looked just
about as foolish as she did. Goodness,
the trouble I have had posing brides
and bridegrooms before the camera I
Instead of telling them' to look pleas
ant I always felt like saying, 'Don't
look idiotic if you can possibly help it,'
and then I would have to think up
some device to keep her from scrouging
down too close agninst his shoulder and
to keep him from responding with a%
equally Inappropriate embrace. But
with all my precautions I never fully
■succeeded in preventing their acting
like lunatics. The other day when look
ing over a lot of old negatives I came
across several hundred of those senti
mental combinations, and I thanked
my lucky stars that nowadays few
newly mated couples have the camera
craze."— Chicago Record-Herald.
POULTRY POINTERS.
 .7— «
Stale bread soaked in milk and
squeezed dry la a good feed for young
ducks.
Only medium sized eggs should be
set. Extra large or small ones are apt
to produce deformed chicks.
Turkeys are not so sure to come
home as other fowls; hence it is a good
plan to mark them in some way.
Feed the young chicks often if joq 1
would have" them growing rapidly, but
do not feed more at a time than they
will eat up clean in a few minutes.
Destroy the old nests as soon as the
hens come off with the chicks. The
safest and best plan is to burn all of
the old material.
' Healthy fowls pick up their food
quickly and relish it. When they go at
it lazily, pick up a grain or two and
then stop something 1b wrong.
Never shut the fowls up in such close
quarters that they cannot take enough
exercise to promote digestion. Hens
treated in this way .will soon become
too fat to lay.
The Stems of the Prickly Pear.
In most plants, to put It simply, the
leaves are the mouths and stomachs of
the organism; their thin and flattened
blades are spread out horizontally in
a wide expanse, covered with tiny
throats and lips which suck in carbonic
acid from the surrounding air and dis
integrate it in their own cells under
the influence of sunlight. In the prick
ly pears, on the contrary, It is the flat
tened stem and branches which under
take this essential operation in the life
of the plant— the sucking In of carbon
and giving out of oxygen, which are to
the vegetable exactly what the eating
and digesting of food are to the animal
organism. In their old age, however,
the stems of the prickly pear display
their true character by becoming
woody in texture and losing their ar
ticulated, leafilke appearance. ,';"■':",
The Green Fiend.
While a number of workmen were
sitting in a wine shop In the Rue de
Chnrenton in Paris one day one of
them, a man of forty, named Negocier,
made a wagar that he would drink a
dozen glasses of absinth while 11
o'clock was striking. The wager was
taken and the twelve glasses placed
on the table. On the first stroke Nego
cier swallowed his first glass, and the
clock had just finished striking when
he drank the twelfth and last. Whilo
his companions were applauding the
feat Negocier staggered and fell heavi
ly to the floor. He was picked up dead.'

ed "the Gordon highlanders" by giv
ing each recruit a guinea in gold and a
kiss from her own lips. It is notorious
that the regiment was raised to a full
complement quicker than any other
regiment in the British service. But
the highlanders paid well for theli
kiss. They were sent immediately to
fight the French, and In their first en
gagement 300 fell, killed and wounded.
In the year 1703 a stray kiss was the
means of bringing about a bloody and
expensive war. Prince Ferdinand of
Bavaria was journeying in a neighbor
ing state. One day he visited "the roy
al household," and while there his eye
caught sight of a most beautiful maid
en who happened to be near him. He
was so bewitched with her charming
personality that he impulsively and
thoughtlessly Implanted a kiss upon
her fair cheek. She was a princess of
the royal household, which the prince
knew not, neither did he know that she
was an affianced bride and that her be
trothed was near by and saw the
whole affair. Angry words and blows
followed. A duel was fought and both
principals were severely wounded. Dip
lomatic relations between the two king
doms were suspended, and a long and
bloody war ensued, all on account of a
kiss which was paid for most dearly In
blood and treasure.
The Mngnet.
Thousands of years ago a mineral
having the strange power of attracting
iron was found in the country ancient
ly called Magnesia, in Asia Minor. The
name of this country has given us the
word "magnet" This mineral, which
is now called the lodestone (not-load
stone), attracted the attention of the
curious, and it was discovered that a
piece of iron which had been rubbed
with the lodestone acquired the same
power of attracting iron. In other
words, the piece of iron became a mag
net. It was afterward found that such
an iron or artificial magnet could be
used like the lodestone Itself to convert
other pieces or iron into magnets by
rubbing. StiU more recently a mode
of making magnets by means of elec
tricity was discovered— that is, by
wrapping b piece of insulated wire
many times around the bar and then
causing a current of electricity to pass
through the wire. The familiar small
toy magnets are simply steel bars
which have been rubbed a few time?
against powerful magnets.— St. Nich
olas.
Success of the Solemn Asa.
Look about you, gentle reader, and
consider the solemn ass In every walk
of life. Who so respected, so admired,
so influential? He never takes sides.
He never is a partisan. He goes along
with knitted brows, his thoughts too
deep for utterance. Smaller men may
abandon themselves to hasty inclina
tions, to rash preferences, to robust
views. He never does. If he speaks
at all It Is with such profundity and
circumlocution and complexity that
the most recondite cryptogram ever
rescued from a pyramid would seem to
burst of innocent and childish candor
In comparison. Yet he wears fine rai
ment every day. He enjoys the re-
Bpect and confidence of the community.
He prospers. The oil of opulence
anoints him. He is the incarnation of
success!— Washington Post.
Too Smart.
"Once when I was a Mississippi pi
lot," said Mark Twain, "I got out of
work and had to hustle for a new job.
I talked to a number of captains, but
none of them wanted a pilot. Finally
I met a man who said there was a va
cancy on his boat that I might fill if I
could qualify. He asked me about my
habits, my religion, my birth, my
schooling, and so on. Then he said:
'Now, for the main thing: Do you
know where the snags In the river
are?' 'No, captain,' I said, 'I don't.'
He swore. 'Wants to be a pilot,' he
muttered, 'and don't know where the
snags are.'. 1 know where they're not,'
said I. But my smartness cost me the
Job."
Kind, bat Firm.
An English bishop owned a portable
bath tub which he failed on one occa
sion to take with him on a pastoral vis
itation. When he returned he j found
that the housemaid had used the be
loved tub. Calling her into his study,
he said kindly, "Mary, I do not so
much mind your using my tub, but
what I object to is that you should do
behind my back what you would not
do before my f ace."— Lippincott's.
His Excuse.
"No," said a citizen when asked if he
would contribute anything to the relief
of the flood sufferers; "I don't think I
Can t afford It, ear
"It isn't that, but the last time I gave
something for charity one of the papers
ipelled by name wrong."
Nothing Done.
"I don't think I'll wager with you,"
said the baker. "You haven't the
dough."
"That may be," replied the butcher,
"but I don't see you putting up any
6takes."— Boston Commercial Bulletin.
'Went Too For.
An unsuccessful lover was asked by
what means he had lost the object of
bis affections.
"Alas," he said, "I flattered her till
she got too proud to speak to me."
Woman'! Way.

made in your heart.
He— Yes; but you'll be mad at me If
it does.— Detroit Free Press.

Walking Leaves.
Nature's^ law being almost universal
so far as 'the protection of the weak
creatures is concerned, it is not at all
wonderful perhaps that she has formed
Insects ' into perfect counterparts of
flowers, leaves, sticks, etc. Some of
the "walking leaves," those which are
natives of India, China iu.il Japan in
particular, are large, grotesque look
ing creatures, their resemblance being
strikingly like a bundle of yellow
twigs joined together with faded, mac
erated leaves. The limbs of this spe
cies of insect are long, slender and
very twigllke, the coloring being suited
to that particular species of vegetation
upon which the deceptive miinicker
subsists.
The "walking stick," like the walk
ing leaf, is also very deceptive as far
as looks go. The males have small,
slender bodies, the legs or arms start
ing from it just as smaller limbs of a
tree or weed start from larger ones.
The "walking thorn" of Java belongs
to this curious order of insects, as do
also the "devil's horse" and the mantis.
The "walking thorn" looks exactly like
the large compound spine of our com
mon honey locust tree, even in color
and general contour.
How Eyes Are Tested.
The "theory of the optically perfect
eye is that parallel rays of light enter
ing it are brought to a focus on its ret
ina. Any deviation from this condi
tion constitutes an error of refraction
and requires for its correction an arti
ficial variation of the luminous rays.
The generally adopted method of de
termining the refraction of the eye is
to use test types placed at such a dis
tance that the rays of light emanating
from them may be regarded in practice
as parallel, and the deviation from par
allelism necessary to correct a refrac
tive error is effected by placing a lens
in front of the eye. There are many
other methods of changing the course
of luminous ' rays coming from a test
object, and of these the single convex
lens is the simplest and most often
used in optometry. .
Crushing; an Actor.
A brother actor famous for his pom
posity and his Inordinate ambition waa
regaling Sir Henry Irving with a fore
cast of his plans for the future. : " ' •
"I shall begin the season," he an
nounced, "with such and such a part,
and after that I shall appear as Ham
let." ■
"Urn!" drawled Irving. "As— eh—
Hamlet, did you say?" , •>-
The other, incensed by the tone of the
query, bridled up at once.
"Do you think, Sir Henry," he de
manded indignantly, "that you are the
only man who can play Hamlet?"
"Oh, no," rejoined Irving blandly,
"but I am quite sure that you are the
only man who can't"— Harper's Week
ly.
The Clydesdale Horse.
The Clydesdale horse should walk at
a swinging pace of not less than four
miles an hour, and If he wants to trot
he should move straight and close,
with the points of the hocks turned in
ward rather than outward. He should
not be wide between the thighs nor
should his fore legs be planted on the
outside of his shoulders, causing him
to walk like a bulldog.
The Wrong: Man.
