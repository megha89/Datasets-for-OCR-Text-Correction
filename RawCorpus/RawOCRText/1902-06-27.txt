EXERCISE AND EATING.
Remember That a Tired Stomach la
a 'Weak Stomach.
A good dinner at night is necessary
for those whose pleasure or work keeps
them up very late. But for ordinary
folk who dine at 6 or 7 and go to bed
about 10:30 onjy a light wholesome re
past should be taken at the end of the
day, when muscles and nerves are
more or less exhausted. j'
A "tired stomach Is a weak stomach"
Is a golden rule to remember. Yet how
often one hears people say, "I've been
rushing about all day and am tired to
death; I must have a big meal to make
up for it!" You may put the big meal
into the stomach, but you cannot make
the stomach digest it.
A belief lives strong in the hearts and
minds of the majority of mankind, in
cluding persons of weak digestions,
that a quick, brisk walk taken before
a' meal gets up an appetite and helps
the stomach to digest the food. Now,
this Is exactly what it doesn't do. Ex
ercise spreads the blood throughout the
body. For the proper digestion of food
the blood is needed in the stomach.
Few realize this important fact
After a long, exhausting walk, bicy
cle spin or any severe physical or men
tal strain take a good half hour's rest
in a comfortable armchair or lying on a
sofa before you eat a substantial meal.
A Telephone Whlatle.
When the earpiece of a telephone re
ceiver is held to the mouthpiece of the
transmitter, a more or" less shrill tone
or whistle-is heard in the receiver. This
occurs when the apparatus is in good
working condition and when the trans
mitter is on short circuit. This effect
is seemingly due to a series of reactions
analogous to but much more complex
than those which occur in an electric
bell when its circuit is closed. A move
ment of the diaphragm of the receiver
toward its magnet tends to weaken the
pressure on the carbon of the transmit
ter, which causes a weakening of the
current, allowing the diaphragm to fall
away, with the further result that the
air column is compressed, increasing
the. pressure on the carbon again and
also increasing current strength, where
by the diaphragm in again attracted,
and this action is repeated over and
over again.— Gassier'B Magazine.
Oriental Hvgrn.
"Oriental rugs," says a New York
dealer, "are nearly as standard as gold.
When an auctioneer sells you one for
$200, you may think you are getting It
cheap, but you can get it at about the
same price from any reputable dealer.
Every rug house has its agents at auc
tions, who pay mighty close to the mar
ket price for the genuine article. When
you have had an oriental rug for ten or
fifteen years, it Is worth more than
when you bought it, provided it Is in
good condition. It Is then an antique.
When you hear of any one buying sec
ondhand oriental rugs at about one
third or one-quarter of their value, you
may safely wager that they have been
patched."
Theology aa He Understood It.
Passengers in an uptown car one aft
ernoon last week were very much en
tertained and amused by a discussion
of things spiritual by two colored pas
sengers. As the debate waxed warmer
the voices of the debaters grew louder
until what was said was plainly audi
ble to all in the car. After each had
made a confession of faltb and given
his views of the means whereby mortal
man could gain salvation one of the
pair blurted out in a tone that implied
that all his hope for the next world
was embodied In the words:
"Well, sah, I b'lleve dat what* s gwine
to be is sho'ly gwine to be."
"Hub," grunted his companion con
temptuously, "den yo' b'lleves In pre
medltashun."—Baltimore Sun.
The Limit.
"And the railway company agrees to
settle by paying me $5,000, does it?"
said the man who had been injured.
"How much of it do I get?"
"You get all of it," said the lawyer,
"and jam pay me .what you please. It
didn't take me five minutes to get a
settlement out of them."
This, O reader, is no fancy sketch.

TWO MEN AND A MORAL.
An Incident That Suypllea Consider
able Food For Thought.
These ought ye to do* and not to leave the
Others undone.
A pale young man *t down on a
bench in the park. He imt a torn bag
Of tools under the bench.
A email, red faced man came behind
him. He stooped to steal the bug.
The pale man turned and said in a
slow, tired way: "Drop that It ain't
worth stealing."
The ruddy man said, "Not if you're
lookin'."
The pale man set tbe bag at his feet
and said:
"It's a poor business you're in."
"You don't look as if yours was any
better." He sat down. "What's your
callin'?"
"I'm an Ironworker; bridge work."
"Don't look strong enough."
"That's so. I'm just out of the hos
pital; got hurt three months ago."
"I'm just out of hospital, too," he
grinned. .
"What hospital?"
"Sing Sing."
"What? Jail?"
"Yes; not bad in winter, either.
There's a society helps a fellow after
you quit that hospital. Gives you good
clothes too."
"Clothes? Is that so?"
"Gets you work" —
"Work— good God! I wish they'd get
me some."
"You ain't bad enough. Go and grab
some thin. Get a short sentence; first
crime. Come out and get looked after
by nice ladles."
"My God!"
"Didn't they do nothin* for you when
you got out of that hospital?"
"No! Why the devil should they? I'm
only an honest mechanic. Are you go
in'?"
"Yes. I've got to go after that job.
It'll give me time to look about me.
Gosh, but you look bad! Goodby."
The ruddy man rose, looked back,
jingled the few coins in his pocket hes
itated and walked away whistling.
The pale man sat still on the bench,
staring down at the ragged bag of tools
at his feet— Dr. Weir Mitchell in Cen

SOME WRITERS.
Button wrote in lace ruffles and Alex
andre Dumas In shirt sleeves.
: Milton composed his "Paradls* Lost"
on a large armchair, with his head
thrown back.
Bret Harte's first literary success
was a little book called "Condensed
Novels," In which he parodied some
prominent novelists of the day.
Austin Dobsln, the poet, wanted in
early life to be an engineer and was
preparing for that profession when his
parents persuaded him to enter the
civil service.
When Fox had eaten heartily, he
would retire to his study, envelop his
bead in a napkin soaked in vinegar and
water and work sometimes ten hours
in succession.
Allison Is said to have consumed
twenty-four years in the preparation of
his "History of Europe," but many im
portant literary enterprises were also
carried on by him during this time.
It is related of Hall Came, the novel
ist, that he once worked in the Lazey
lead mines, In the Manx mountains, In
place of a young man who was ill to
keep the young fellow's position for
him.
Mrs. Bolton, the Indiana composer of
the once popular song "Paddle Your
Own Canoe," received the inspiration
to write while sewing and fitting the
first carpets for the old statehouse of
Indiana.
A College Han and a Quotation.
Some one once said, "A Harvard man
knows all literature but the Bible," a
startllngly sweeping generality, but
not without truth so far as the Bible is
concerned. A case in point came to
light the other day. Two Harvard men
were reading together some famous
modern orations, one of them a eulogy.
The eulogy closed with the words: "O
death, where is thy sting? O grave,
where is thy victory?"
"What a beautiful close!" exclaimed
one of the students enthusiastically.
"The man who wrote such a sentence
as that proves that the grand style in
prose did not die with the eighteenth
century."
It should be added In fairness that
the other s'-^ent was a churchman
and said noi^.ug.— New York Tribune.
"It's the Cat."
An aged country rector who had an
old tailor as his clerk, returning from
his church one Sunday with the latter,
thus addressed him:
"Thomas, I cannot think how it Is
that our church should be getting thin
ner and thinner, for I am sure I preach
as well as ever I did and ought to have
far more experience than I bad when I
first came among you."
"Indeed," replied Thomas. "I'll tell
you what; old parsons nowadays are
just like old tailors, for I'm sure I sew
as well as ever I did In my life, and the
cloth is the same, but it's the cut sir,
ahl it's the new cut"— Pearson's.
Diogenes and I»o8>.
Diogenes died from the bite of a dog,
and his last request to the neighbors

fused to do so and gave him a noble

honor, upon which was carved the fig
ure of a dog, the symbol of his life.—

HAVE WOMEN INTUITION
One Writer Snya They Have Never
Shown It In Literature.
Literature is the final expression of
human thought If women can . lay
claim to a special faculty of intuition,
why do they not manifest it in _ their
writings? Intuition, if It means any
thing, means the faculty that gets
down to the germ of actions and char
acteristics and focuses external traits
Into a central verity recognizable to
the general public. Now, there are
more female writers than male. No
woman poet has ever written an in
evitable line, a line that flashes spon
taneously out of the unknown and casts
an illuminating light upon the abyss.
Woman has added practically nothing
to our stock of familiar quotations.
Take down your Bartlett or your an
thology, and you may be surprised to
find tbat from Mrs. Browning to Mrs.
Meynell women have never coined a
phrase which lias passed into the com
mon currency of speech.' Mrs. Brown
ing has indeed written fine lines, but
nothing of hers can be said to have be
come a household word.
Nor has any woman novelist created
any character that Is generally recog
nized as typical. George Eliot has
come closest with her Tito Melema
aud Mrs. Poyser. You would appeal
only to the educated few if you de
scribed a person as a Tito or a Poyser.
But call a man a Don Quixote, a
Mlcawber, a Dogberry, a Falstaff, a
Colonel. Newcome, a Bilfll, a Parson
Adams or Bob Acres, call a woman a
Mrs. Malnprop, a Becky Sharp, a Bea
trice, a Diana Vernon, a Meg Merrilies,
and even the illiterate will mentally
classify the individual as you wish him
or her to be classified.
"Ah, but," you say, "in real life wo
men are tbe true intuitions. They size
up a man or a woman at a glance.
They, are never mistaken when they
trust to their instincts."
I can only testify to my own experi
ence. I have not found that women's
snap Judgments of character are im
bued with any special verity. They
form likes or dislikes quicker than a
man does because they are quicker on
the trigger of conjecture. They can
only be one of two things, right or
wrong. If time proves that they 'are
right as they must be in 50 per cent of
cases, the right guess Is remembered
and treasured up by the slower minded
man as an extraordinary Instance of
intuition. The wrong guess is forgot
ten.—William S. Walsh in Era.
To Snve Tempera and Collars.
"You button your collar the wrong
way," said the salesman as he was
selling neckwear to a customer.
"How is that?"
"You have buttoned the right side
last. Now, when you go to take it off
you will have to tug at the end of the
collar and crumple it, because you
can't get a proper hold of it but if you
had the left end on top you could get
it off easily, then loosen tbe collar be
hind, and the right end could be easily,
detached. That's why men have sd
much trouble taking off well laundered
collars. Remember to fasten tbe right
side first and ] then the left, and you
will save your collars and your tem
per."
"I never supposed there was a right
and a wrong way of putting on col
lars."

Astronomical Solution*.
Though 300 years hare elapsed since
the death of Tycho Brahe, It appears
that we are In many lines almost as
far from the ultimate goal as when he
began the great work of exploring the
Bkles before the days of Kepler, when
all Europe was slumbering In intellec
tual darkness. The science of the stars
indeed has been refined and perfected
in an unparalleled degree and infinitely
extended in nil directions, but with the
bounds of darkness pushed back step
by step the goal Is not and never will
be in sight An infinity of objects and
causes and an endless variety of phe
nomena are yet to be explored, and the
work of the mind is rather. a process
of development to the perfect under
standing of the universe than the solu
tion of a simple mathematical problem.

THE BULLET FROM AFAR.
How Modern War Methoda Try th«
Soldiers' Werrea.
Today a man may die as soon as the
enemy's guns, hidden away In the dis
tant cloud topped mountains seven
miles away, begin to talk. And over
that seven miles he must walk with
caution, with a wide interval between
him and j his pals on either hand. He
must He down at every, short halt and
icratch the ground hurriedly with his
little spade at every long one, /or the
great shells are sailing toward | him,
and he 4 see« by his officer's eye and
hears by his commands that it is con
sidered that he may perish at any mo
ment and that precautions are neces
sary to preserve him. He sees, more
over, how futile those precautions must
be if one of those monsters howling
overhead should land as near to him as
the last: one did to that blasted tree,
for instance, with its . scorched, dan
glina; H-i'lw nnd j the huge charred fig
sure in its stout trunk, or as the one
before did to the team of mules in the
ambulance wagon, now a screaming,
struggling jumble of harness • and
bloody flesh.
All this is dispiriting and appears un
necessary. The country on all sides is
as peaceful as his native dale, not a
sign of an enemy. Even the great blue
bill ahead, on which he is told the ene
my's long guns are posted, looks as
quiet as the mountain on a Christmas
card. Yet for two miles he walks
through death, thinking only of it be
cause there is nothing else to think of,
and then as twilight falls bivouacs in
extended line, sees his friends run for
their tea between tbe fall of the shells,
notices one cf them time his run back
badly and meet a projectile in full ca
reer, to part from it an awful and dis
gusting offense, and then lies down in
the darkness with shaking nerves and
the thought that five worse miles still
Intervene between him and the guns he
knows be is intended to take.
Next morning be Is awakened by a
shell, is marched with infinite caution
for two mare miles, shelled the whole
wuy,' Is shelled even in his bivouac by
the light of the moon and as he watch
es the projectiles bursting like water
spouts of fire along his hillside is glad
when he is told that tomorrow will be
the battle, after which if he wins and
if he lives he mdy be able to walk and
sleep in peace for a space.— "A Line
man" in New York World.
LINCOLN'S DISPATCHES.
Why Many of Them Were Dated
From the War Department.
Surprise is often expressed by very
intelligent people that so large a pro
portion of President Lincoln's most im
portant telegrams and some of his let
ters are dated from the war depart
ment Instead of the executive mansion
and none of them from the navy, treas
ury or other administrative bureaus.
This is generally deemed a very singu
lar fact, and from it writers have
plaustbly^draivji ton conclusion that
Lincoln personally llkMhpJ^s-rretary
of war better than afl»T^ine other
cabinet officers. While this Indeed ap
pears to have been true, It does not nec
essarily so follow. He certainly held
Mr. Seward In high regard, yet he sel
dom went to the state department
In the circumstances it was not at all
singular. The explanation is easy. War
was the business of that time, and Lin
coln's eyes were always .bent to the
army, especially when great military
events were impending. He habitually
haunted the adjacent war department
and army headquarters, where abode
General Halleck, his military adviser,
for news and views. Head and heart
were strenuously concentrated on the
fight wherever it might be. His fertile
brain saw, too, the critical points in the
game oftentimes far more clearly than
pome of his so called "ablest generals."
He not only wished to know what ; was
going on in the field, but performed hla
own part nobly. In the heat of action
or at crucial moments his orders,' sug
gestions and inquiries were fired off
spontaneously from wherever he might
be at the moment and at such periods
he was generally "over at the war de
partment" with Mr. Stanton. That is
the chief reason why so many of his
dispatches are dated at that depart
ment and not because he perhaps held
Stanton in higher esteem than the sec
retary of the navy or state or treasury."

AN INCENSE PARTY.
Odd Etiquette of an Intereatlns; Ja#-
anese Function.
If you ever receive an Invitation to a
Japanese incense party, accept it
promptly and thankfully. It has no
counterpart In our own social system
and is as merry and pleasant an affair
as can be imagined. The people of the
mikado's land have trained the nos
trils for generations the same as ,we
have trained the eye and ear, and they
display a skill which at times is star
tling to a westerner. There is an odd
etiquette to be followed In these social
affairs. For the twenty-four hours
preceding the party each guest must
avoid the use of anything which can
produce any odor whatever. Scented
Boaps, perfumes, odorous foods and
even spices must be avoided. These
prevent the user from smelling accu
rately and also Interfere with the other
members of the party. ■
When you dress, be careful to put on
«no garment that has been kept in the
neighborhood of camphor wood, tobac
co, bouquets, dried blossoms or scented
powder. "When you reach the house of
your host, enter it as softly as you can
and as slowly as possible. This Is to
prevent making a draft by the move
ment of your own body. Be equally
leisurely in opening and closing doors,
as a quick movement Induces a sud
den rush of air. In the drawing room
the hostess burns a series of incenses,
usually four or five In number. Each
guest la allowed to take three sniffs of
each Incense and must then Jot down
Its name and number upon a card.
Each of the four or five incenses Is
burned two or three times, so that the
number of cards will vary from eight
to fifteen. At the end the cards are
laid out on the table, and the hostess
reads the names of the Incenses em
tployed, which are checked off upon
the cards. The guest who has guessed
the largest number receives a pretty
prize, which is sometimes a silver or
bronze incense burner, statuette or
carving. Among the Japanese the aver
age woman guesses correctly about six
times In ten, while with the American
women the ratio is three in ten.— New
York Poet ;
HER LOST DIARY.
The Plaguy Thing Had All Her Dear
eat Secrets Recorded Too.
"Diary!" fairly shrieked the pretty
young lady, with flashing eyes, as she
walked down the avenue with a com
panion. * "Diary! Don't you say diary
to me again. What do you know
Rbout It, Kate?'
"Nothing, only that you told me that
you had commenced keeping a diary,
as usual, and I supposed you had drop
ped It at the end of a month, as usual.
I didn't mean to throw you into hys
terics."
"Kate, don't you ever breathe a word
of It, but I've lost that diary; dropped
It somewhere on the street. And the
plaguy thing has all my dearest secrets
in it I wrote Just what I thought too.
It just sends me crazy. There It Is in
black and whlte'that Lillian looks like
a fright, that Hattie Is turning green
from jealousy, that Charley Is Just too
6weet to live and that Fred hasn't
sense enough to talk more than three
minutes unless he rehearses in ad
vance."
".Why don't you advertise and offer
a reward?"
"Indeed, I won't I never want to
see the thing again. If any one returns
it, I shall declare that it's a forgery
from beginning to end. I'll never own
up the longest day I live."
"What did you say about me, Edith?"
"Oh. I don't just remember, but some
thing nice. You can depend on that, for
you're my very dearest friend."
"I can help your memory. You wrote
that I was the most inquisitive little
minx In the city and that I thought it
my special business to look after othei
people's business. Here's your diary.
You left it at our house, and Tommy
spelled out your estimate of me before
I knew what he was doing. Good after
noon."

began to cry, fell into each other's arms

TO CORRESPONDENTS.
We look to the friends of the Ledger to keep
us posted concerning events of public Interest
happening In any part of the county. Our reg
ular correspondents will be furnished with
writing material and stamps tor this purpose.

ments, mining and other Industrial progress,

A NOVEL POLICY.
The Dispatch desires to publish
all announcements of socials, festi
vals, etc., that are going on. All
such notices of entertainments will
be published one insertion free, as a
matter of news. After once pub
lished the news feature is destroyed,
and subsequent insertions will be
charged for at advertising rates. —
Dispatch.
We find the above notice hoisted
at the mast head ot our cotem
porary, as a statement of the policy
pursued by that journal in drawing
the line of demarcation between a
legitimate news item and an adver
tisement. It is the most astonish
ing announcement on that proposi
tion that we have ever seen paraded
in the columns of a newspaper. We
do not believe it can be matched as
a business proposition by any other
country paper in the land. It is in
fact a public invitation along starva
tion lines. It would be amusing in
its verdancy, were it not for the
disgraceful belittlement of a noble
profession which its publication im
plies. Pressed to its logical issue,
it means that all future -events, of
whatsoever nature, are items of
news to the extent of one insertion,
and as such are entitled to free in
sertion. A tax sale, a notice to
creditors in a probate proceeding,
an ordinance of the board of super
visors, in like manner are items of
news, and on that basis should be
given free publication for one time.
That is just an entire transposition
of the rules of the newspaper busi
ness, one of the fundamental princi
ples of which is that the first inser
tion should be charged, for obvious
reasons, at a higher rate than sub
sequent insertions. Why should a
merchant's announcement of -a 50
per cent reduction sale be regarded
as an advertisement demanding p?,y
at so much per line, and a church
festival to take place in the future,
and at which an admission price is
to be charged, as an item of news
which the publisher is under obliga
tions to scatter broadcast for
nothing. What would be thought
of a merchant who would publicly
proclaim that the first order from a
customer would be filled free of
charp?, and only on subseauent
irder.. would he expect an equiva
lent in coin? Suppose all business
men i & town were to adopt the
same rule, how long would the town
as a business center survive the
ordeal? Such a policy would be
nothing less than business suicide.
Not one whit less suicidal is the
business item which we cull from
our cotemporary, and which is
flaunted week after week before the
world as a sample of newspaper
wisdom. Is it' to be wondered at
that the printing business is un
profitable? No business could be
profitably conducted along similar
lines.
The truth is, every event in the
future, from the publisher's stand
point, is in the nature of an adver
tisement. No newspaper man
should be expected to announce any
kind of entertainment at which an
admission fee is to be charged free
of charge. It makes not the slight
est difference whether the proceeds
are to be devoted to church or chari
table purposes or any other object.
If, in the opinion of those who are at
the head of the entertainment, its
announcement in the columns of the
local paper would tend to increase
the patronage, they ought to be
willing to pay a fair value for the
services rendered. When the
columns of the paper are used for
the express purpose of bringing
revenue for any individual or organ
ization, the space used for that
object is an advertisement, and
should be paid for, no matter
whether it be used for the first or
the twentieth time.
While' this is unquestionably the
correct rule, it has become cus
tomary to relax it under certain
conditions, as the judgment of the
publisher may dictate. For in
stance, where the promoters of a
dance or entertainment send pat
ronage in the shape of job print
ing to the office, a short notice
of the forthcoming dance or enter
tainment is published without
charge, as a matter of courtesy.
This was the course the Ledger had
followed for years, prior to its sale
by the present editor .« J. 5.92. On
resuming control, however, last ye.w_ i
we found a widely different plan pre
vailing. ' The local columns are made
the dumping place of free advertis
ing matter, from numerous sources,
and printers are decrying ' the
decadence of the business which they
have helped to debase and destroy..
Not only has the advertising patron
age been curtailed, - but the job
printing department has suffered
sympathetically as it were. If the
promoters of a festival can get the
same advertised for nothing, as
legitimate news matter, they are
apt to forgo the expense of posters
and other requisites in the printing
line. In other words, they depend
entirely on the free advertising.
The printer is used to help rake in
the dimes for every money-raising
scheme that comes along, and he
gets nix for his trouble, j Nay, worse
than this, the standing notice in the
columns of our coteraporary carries
the impression that the editor is
actually the favored party, and
ought to be thankful for an adver
tisement disguised under the label of
"news item, one insertion." The
Ledger is as well able to stand this
pernicious, unbusinesslike method
as its co temporaries. But we do
not propose to do so. Our cotem
porary can keep his dishonorable
free-trade flag flaunting before the
public if he pleases, but we prefer
the path of self-protection, and will
hereafter draw the blue pencil
through the "free advertisement"
schemes, subject only to the excep
tions herein referred to.
A PROTEST FROM CALAVERAS.
The Calaveras Prospect of last
week republished the article in the
Ledger of two weeks ago on the sub
ject of itemized bills. It admits that
the practice of lumping road bills in
the name of the supervisor or road
master of the district has been prev
alent of late in that county, and has
already given birth to much dissat
isfaction. Why the old plan of pre
senting a verified bill for the work
performed or material furnished by
each person has been abandoned in
that county is not stated. Prob
ably the only reason is that it was
found much easier to lump the
claims. And Amador county hav
ing established the precedent years
ago, it was natural to conclude that
Calaveras bad the same legal right
to do so as Amador. The Prospect
article says:
In Calaveras as the Ledger says,
the published proceedings of the
board show the road bills generally
as lumped to the supervisors of the
district or to his road master for the
special section of the road. This
course has given great dissatisfac
tion to the taxpayers who have no
means of knowing whether the bills
presented have been properly itemiz
ed or not. The law provides for the
publication of the proceedings, pre
sumably for the information of the
taxpayer, but it becomes a question
whether the mere fact that so much
money was paid out, without giving
an itemized report is the legal infor
mation required by law. The law is
very explicit that every bill shall be
itemized, and how it shall be item
ized, before it can be allowed, and it
may be presumed that the super
visors follow the law in this respect,
otherwise they would be subject to
criminal proceedings under the pro
vision of the law providing that no
public money shall be paid out ex
cept in accordance with law.
But the published minutes do not
show this fact, and the public claim
the right to know that the persons
whose names appear in the minutes
as receiving the money do or not do
the work, and the taxpayers who
pay -for this information claim the
right to know who are the recipi
ents of the, public bounty. It is
only recently that this practice of
lumping the bills has been followed,
and like the Ledger the Prospect
would be glad to know the legal
authorization for such a course.
THE PRIOR CONVICTIONS.
The Stockton dailies, desirous of
correcting the erroneous impression
that had been created by the publi
cation of a statement that the prior
convictions were proved against
Macquarric at his recent trial in
Jackson, published our article in full
explaining the matter. The Mail,
however, takes the opportunity of
making the following comment:
In this defense of Macquarrie the
Ledger itself acknowledges that he
was convicted in San Francisco.
The fact that he was released on
habeas corpus may indicate that he
was not guilty, and it may not so in
dicate. Occasionally" habeas corpus
proceedings are brought on the
ground that the evidence was in
sufficient, but generally the point
raised is that there was some defect
in the legal method of procedure.
This is hardly fair. When a de
fendant is released on habeas corpus
proceedings, after conviction, it
shows that he was not legally con
victed. The jury that was called
upon to pass on these prior convic
tions said they were untrue. This
conclusion was reached on the
strength of the documentary evi
dence presented to them. On this
verdict Macquarrie is entitled to all
presumptions of innocence, the same
as though he had never been con
victed or accused of the petty
crimes charged.
The Missouri democrats plume
themselves on achieving the most
effective gerrymander of modern
times. If their plans work as they
expect, the republicans, polling a
vote of 314,000, will have only a
single representative, while the
democrats, polling 351,000, will have
14. But sometimes such plans do
not work as advertised. — Boston
"Journal."
THE ATVrADOR LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, JUNE 27. 1902.
AMENDING THE MINING' LAWS.
A bill has been introduced in the
senate, which, should it become a
law, would be. of benefit to the min
ing industry in that it would dispose
of much litigation caused by the
question of extralaveral rights. Tho
bill is to amend the laws relating to
mineral land locations,, and gives
locators the exclusive right to pos
session of all the surface land within
their lines and of all veins, lodes,
etc., throughout the entire depth
which lie within such surface lines,
extending downward vertically.
Locations are to be 1,500 feet square
in all cases in which previous loca
tions do not prevent. The existing
legal provision concerning tunnels is
repealed. The present law ia re
gard to location gives an area of
600 to 1,500 feet, but permits ownera
to follow the vein outsid 'be lines.
The effect of the prop^s. J. amend
ment would be to exte_fi the area
and to confine mining within the
surface lines vertically extended.
The arguments in favor of a change
in the mining laws along the lines
above indicated are* forcible and
many. The complex system now in
force is anything but satisfactory.
It has given birth to much vexatious
litigation, and has resulted in con
flicting decisions. With the right
to mine within certain well defined
limits, matters would be greatly
simplified. A claim 1500 feet wide,
instead of 600 feet under the present
law, would still fall a long way short
of meeting all the requirements of a
mine along the mother lode. With
the lode line in the center of the
claim, this would give 750 feet as the
utmost distance the vein could be
followed on its eastern dip. This
limit, with the ordinary pitch of the
ledge on this lode, would be reached
in a depth of from 1500 to 2000 feet.
However, any change in the law
would not affect existing patented
claims; probably would not effect
unpatented locations. And as all
the territory embracing the main
mineral belt of this county is claim
ed, the proposed change in the law
would make very little difference in
this mineral section.
The Republicans of congress
should resist all efforts at tariff
smashing. The people want stabil
ity, certainty, prosperity. Let the
would-be tariff tinkers howl to their
heart's content. They are either
seeking political advantage or are
clinging to their pet free- trade
ideas, which have brought ruin
whenever allowed to prevail. — New

The democrats are saying that if
they get a sound platform and then
have all the divisions of the party
vote for it they may win at the next

might pull through; but if he did not
there was no hope for him. — Camden

Spring Fever.
Spring fever is another name for
biliousness. It is more serious than
post people think. A torpid liver and
inactive bowels mean a poisoned sys
tem. If neglected, serious illness may
follow such symptoms. DeWitt" : s
Little Early Risers remove all danger
by stimulating the liver, opening the
bowels and cleansing out the system of
impurities. Safe pills. Never gripe.
"I have taken DeWitfs Little Early
Risers for torpid liver every spring for
years," writes R. M. Ever.y, Mounds
ville, W. Va. They do me more good,
than anything I have ever tried.

THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, JUNE 27, 1902.
MINING NEWS.
Central Eureka. — Speaking of
this mino the Mining Review says that
every level from 1500 feet to 2000 foot
is now opened. The ore from the 1800,
1900 and 2000 foot levels average $10
per ton. The company has put in a
new air compressor and has paid a
dividend this month of two cents per
share or a total amount of $8,000.
Next month It is likely the dividend
will be 5 cents per share.
WlLDMAN.— Sinking is in progress
at this Sutter Creek mine. The Ma
honey has been closed, on account, it is
said, of the poverty of the ore.
Kennedy.— As a result of the de
velopments on the 2200 and 2300 levels
last month, the stock of tho company
jumped several dollars per share.
While a portion of the ledge Is said to
be very rich, on the whole it is a low
grade proposition. The ore body is
large, in places over 100 feet wide, and
taken altogether it is not expected to
average more than from $5' to $6 per
ton. This, however, Is just the kind of
a proposition that mining men prefer.
The Argonaut is practically closed.
Only a few men are employed in finish
ing up. A number of men have been
laid off the past week. The mine gave
employment to between 30 and 50 men.
The new twenty stamp mill of the
Mitchell mine, near Pine Grove, is ex
pected to start up about the Ist of next
month.

Fell Down Shaft-
Pete Senney, commonly known as
Fronch Pete, met with a serious acci
dent in the east shaft of the Kennedy
on Tuesday afternoon. He is a car
penter, and went to work for the Ken
nedy Company only the day before the
accident. He was employed -on the
surface principally. Something, how
ever, needed fixing about the tank at
the 2500 level, which required the ser
vices of a carpenter, and he was de
tailed to assist in making the repairs.
It was his first experience in a mining
shaft. He either missed his footing or
slipped, with the result that he fell
from the tank to the platform below, a
distance of 10 or 12 feet. The opening
into the sump occupied the center of
the shaft, but he fortunately missed
falling into that. His fellow workmen
got him out as soon as possible, and he
jvas brought to town, to Chirm's lodg
ing house- Dr. Endicott was called,
and found that a portion of the collar
bone was broken, with a number of
slighter injuries. It is thought that
it will be six or eight weeks before he
will bo able to go to work again.
The Fourth at Jackson.
After several efforts had been made
to awaken an Interest in a fourth of
July celebration in Jackson, a small
home affair has finally been arranged
in honor of Independence day. H. C.
Lester, H. E. Kay »nd F ; A. Voorheis
went arouud as" a soliciting committee
during the week, and secured contri
butions aggregating something over
$100. A movement was talked of that
a canvass, costing from $120 to $140
was to be purchased as a town piece of
furniture, to be used free whenever
needed for a celebration by the citizens
of Jackson, and to be rented out to
other organizations. The editor of the
Lodger holds the sum of $42— the bal
ance left over from the oelebratlon last
year. This money is available for
strictly celebration purposes, and will
not be used with bis consent for any
other object whatever.
A New Survey,
Tha Standard Electric Company
started a crew of six men to work last
Monday to survey a new power line
from tho plant at Electra to Sutter
Creek. The surveying part Is under
tho direction of Mr. Gould, a thorough
and experienced euryeyor. It Is ex
pected that the survey for this line,
which is fully eight miles in length,
will occupy from five to six weeks. At
least three routes will be surveyed,
and from these the final selection will
be made by the directors. We under
stand the line is to be as straight and
short as possible. The object of erect
ing the new line we are unable to ex
plain. The old line has been con
demned for some reason, probably
owing to the fact that it carries so
many wires, and hence more liable to
accident. The telephone wires are
strung along the same poles, and this
practice is found very unsatisfactory.
It is probable that the new power line
is intended to remedy the evils of such
a multiplicity wires.

THE EMSLIE ROAD-JCASE.
Farette Hace loses' on All Points Submitted
to the Jury— A Costly Piece of
Litigation.
The suit brought by Amador county
against Fayette Mace, to condemu cer
tain portions of land owned by F. Mace
in Pioneer school district, which were
needed for a private road by Eric W.
Emslie, camo to a termination last
Friday. The trial occupied the court
from Monday mornirg until Friday
evening. Tho matter has been before
the supervisors and courts for over
five years. The road viewers appoint
ed by the supervisors to survoy and re
port upon the question of damages, al
lowed iv their report $150 to Mace as
compensation for the damage that
would accrue by reason of the proposed
road. Maco refused to accept this
award. Hence the matter was taken
into court by the county, to have the
amount of damages assessed by a jury.
There was such a divergence between
the amount offered by the county and
the sum which the nonconsentlng land
owner deemed a fair compensation,
that there was no hope of a compromise.
The trial lasted five days, with twelve
jurors at $2 per day and mileage, otlicial
reporter at $10 per day, and a host of
witnesses at the same per diem and
mileage as the jurors. The costs will
therefore approximate $500. The
award of the jury is $40 less than the
sum offered Mace in the first . place.
The costs will therefore be thrown upon
the defendant. It is reputed that the
case will be taken to the supreme court
on appeal. The special issues submitted
to the jury and the verdict of the jury
thereon were as follows:
Ist. On the 15th day of August,
1901, what was the value of the prop
erty of defendant, Fayette Mace, sit
uated and embraced in the strip of land
sought to be condemned for the pur
pose of a road? Answer, $110.
2d. What damages will accrue to
the portion of defendant's land not
sought to be condemned by reason of
Its severance from the portion sought
to be condemned, and by reason of the
proposed road? Answer, None.
3d. Will any of the lands of defend
ant be beuefitted by the construction
of the proposed road, and if so, how
4th. What will be the damages to
defendant, Fayette Mace's' easement if
the road petitioned for is opened?
Answer, Nono.

Fire in Plymouth.
Reports wore current in Jackson
Monday afternoon that the business
portion of Plymouth had been wiped
out by fire. Later reports said that
the slaughterhouse of L. Burke, sit
uated some distance from town, to
gether with a barn, had been destroy
ed. Lawrence Burke, the owner of the
slaughterhouse and butcher shop, was
in Jacksou at the time, and received
an urgent message from home to re
turn as soon as possible, as a flro was
raging. From this the exaggerated
reports above alluded to were doubt
less set afloat.
The truth seems to be that a grass
fire started not far from the slaughter
house, and was making headway in the
direction of the Burko building. It
was extinguished, however, without
doing any damage worth speaking of.
Soon afterward, a fire started in
town, in the residence of William
Felker. It started from the kitchen,
and the roof was all ablaze beiQre the
alarm was given. The flames ' spread
from the dwelling house to the black
smith shop near by, and both, struc
tures were utterly destroyed, with
practically all their contents. The
blacksmith 6hop was run by William
Felker and his son George. As far as
we have been able to learn, there was
no insurance upon the property. The
loss falls heavily on the Felker family,
who are left without anything, and
their means of earning a livelihood
destroyed.

Our quiet town was startled last
Monday by the alarm of fire. About
9 o'clock in the morning the fire was
discovered. It had started in the rear
of Dabovich's, and ran along the fence
which surrounded the old slaughter
corral, igniting the grass within. Most
of the pasturage was burned, but no
other damage was done as our skilled
firemen soon had it under control. The
men had all returned to the hay fields
and mines, where they were employed,
when in the afternoon the alarm of fire
was again heard, and all rushing to the
spot found the Felker residence in
flames. It was caused by the stove
pipe separating. - Although every one
worked very hard the flames could not
be extinguished, and the building was
burned to the ground. Their adjoin
ing blacksmith shop was also burned.
Very few things were saved from the
house, but quite a - number of tools
were .- carried out jof the blacksmith
shop. • j.r.v
After the fire as the 'men were re
turning to. their homes or were haul
ing the hose cart to its place, some

Seven Years In Bed-
"Will wonders ever cease?" inquire
the friends of Mrs. L. Pease, of Law
rence, Kan, They knew she had been
unable to leave her bed in seven years
on account of kidney and liver trouble,
nervous prostration and general deb
ility; but, "Three bottles of Electric
Bitters onabled me to walk," she writes,
"and in three months I felt like a new
person." Women suffering from Head
ache, Backache, Nervousness, Sleep

Civil Service Examiqations.
The U. S. civil service commission
will hold examinations, during Septem
ber and October, in several places in
each" state to secure young men and
women for the government service.
There are 126,423 positions in the
classified civil service, being an increase'
of 46,736 in six years. There were
7,972 persons appointed between July
1, 1901, and April 15, 1902, being at the
rate of 10,070 for the year. There will
probably be 11,000 appointments next
year.- Salaries at appointment vary
from $660 to $1,200 a year with liberal
promotions afterward. All appoint
ments are for life, and for most posi
tions only a common school education
is required. Politics or religion is not
considered. Those desiring to take
examinations of this kind can get full
information about them free by writ
ing to the Columbian Correspondence
College, Washington, D. C, and ask
ing for its Civil Service Catalogue for
1902.

THE EAST BELT.
[ Communicated ]
Considerab'a activity is being mani
fested on the east mining belt in Ama
dor county, and quite ' a number of
mines are^ doing development work,
some of which are new discoveries,, and
others that were Idle for a long time,
in need of ' money to continue. | Al
though this section is thinly populated
local capital has played a most import
ant part in what improvements are
already made. The principal element
of success in . quartz mining is capital,
and enough of it, and the places on the
Pacific coast are extremely rare where
such vast' bodies of ore containing
values rich enough to pay handsome
dividends on a reasonable amount of cap
ital judiciously expended, exist as are
here. First-class gilt edge prospects
are to be found here where the owners
have not the knowledge or the means
to attract the attention of capital need
ed for the development and machinery
to put the properties an s, paying basis,
which is mainly responsible for the
suspicion entertained by capitalists not
Informed on the mining industry.
There Is quite a number of so-called
"wild cat propositions" that in justice
to original owners should be credited
to poor financiering and ' not to worth
less properties. Capital (for want of
organized effort) has been allowed to
pass our door In a steady stream to
other portions of the east belt in Tuol
umne county, and in the last few years
numerous dividend paying mines have
been developed, notably tlio Black
Oak, Soulsby, Confidence, Con. Eure
ka, Grizily, Providence. New Era,
Longfellow, etc. ■■-. -D. F.-

He Gave His Address.
Harry Furniss told a good story of a
distinguished but irritable Scotch lec
turer. The gentleman had occasion to
speak in a email town in one of the
I lowland counties, and it chanced that
he met with a more than usually loqua
cious chairman. This genius actually
spoke for a whole hour in "introduc
ing" the lecturer. He wound up by
saying, "It is unnecessary for me to
Bay more, but call upon the talented
gentleman who has come so far to give
us bis address tonight."
The lecturer came forward. "You
want my address? I'll give it to you;
822 Rob Roy Crescent, Edinburgh, and
I'm just off there now. Good night!"—

How Wheat Came to Earth.
A classic account of the distribution
of.- wheat over the primeval world
shows that Ceres, having taught her
favorite, Triptolemus, the art of agri
culture and the science of breadmak-
Ing, gave him her chariot a celestial
vehicle, and that in it he traveled night
and day, distributing this valuable
bread grain among all nations of the
earth.

"Oh, well, my dear," observed he to

Relay Remonstrance.
Johnny and Harry had been left at
home with their big sister, mother hav

At bedtime they wanted to "stay up
for mother," but their sister relentless
ly put them to bed. Harry maintained
a stolid indifference, but Johnny cried
lustily.
Their sister listened at the foot of the
stairs, hoping they would soon be good.

Right Arm Moil Hurt.
Experience indicates that accidents
are far more likely to occur to the right
arm and leg than to the lift, further
evidence of this fact is supplied by the
makers of artificial limbs. Tliey dispose
of many more appendages to the right
side of the body than to the other.
Statistics show that in flfty-four cases
out of a hundred the left leg is stronger
than the right.
PERPETUAL MOTION.
One Inventor Baa Accomplished It
by Harnessing a Cyclone.
It was during the portion of his ca
reer when he lived In the valley of the
south fork of the Big Sunflower river
that Henry Plymshaw, the Inventor,
made his most notable invention. This
invention had to do with cyclones.
One afternoon Inventor Plymshaw.
saw a splendid specimen of a funnel
cyclone coming over the prairie, and he
called to me and said he would go out
and study It, since It was evident that
it was going to one side. The Instant
the cyclone sighted us it came straight
In our direction. We weren't prepared
for this exactly, so all we could do was
to run. We were Just on the point of
giving up when a most extraordinary
thing happened. Ourioue thing. Sort of
natural too. And there it was. Only
one leg, and that down a fifty foot well
In the middle of a sheep pasture. If it
had had two legs, no doubt it could
have Bilrambled out, but It couldn't
make it . with one. Couldn't do any
thing except revolve. And it did do
that. I never saw a cyclone revolve like
that one. Mad apparently because it
had missed Plymshaw and me and got
caught. So it Just buzzed around like a
top. Nothing In the world to stop It.
Most men— mere men of action
would, have been satisfied at getting
away and not having to revolve with
the houses and lots, but not Plymshaw.
No. He got to thinking, and what was
the result? Put a belt around the stem
of that cyclone Just at the top of. the
well, set up a dynamo, strung wire and
ran all the machinery and electric
lights In that part of the country. Reg
ular Niagara for power. Going yet
Nothing to stop it, you see. Wonderful
what a thing mind is!— H. V. Marr in
Harper's Ma prnzlne.
A DOMESTIC EXPERIENCE.
The Reason One Woman's Cook Was
DiMsntlafled With. Her Place.
"This Is a queer age we live in,"
sighed a young housekeeper. "We've
Just lost a very good cook for a very
absurd reason, I think. She came to
us about four months ago and was
satisfactory' in every way— neat, in
dustrious, respectful and last, but
foremost, an excellent cook.
"As she was so very quiet 1 could
not tell whether or not she. was as
well pleased with us as we were with
her, but about six weeks ago the trou
ble began. She asked me suddenly
one day why we entertained so sel
dom.
" 'Ella,' I said, 'we don't care to en
tertain except a- few choice friends
now and then. It costs more than we
can afford, nnd we really don't care
for it.'
" 'Your house is just as handsome as
anybody's,' she went on. 'Other peo
ple that I've lived with entertained all
the time, and their houses weren't
near as pretty or as nice as yours.
You never have anything but a club
meeting once In awhile. Why don't
you have teas and receptions, Mrs.
Blank?'
"I reiterated my two reasons— that
we couldn't speud money in that way
and that we preferred simple amuse
ments. Ella didn't seem satisfied, but
the matter was dropped. Last Mon
day she asked to spend a week at
home Trith her sick aunt, and, as I
couldn't well refuse, she departed. To
day I received a postal card from her
couched in these words:
"Dear Mrs. Blank— My aunt Is better,
but I'm not coming: back. I've got a more
stylish place."

Three Rules For Fishing*
One day as the Rev. Mark Guy
Pearse of London was strolling along a
river bank he saw an old man fishing
for trout and pulling the fish out one
after the other briskly. "You manage
it cleverly, old friend," he said. "I
have passed a good many below who
don't seem to be doing anything."
The old man lifted himself up and
stuck his rod in the ground. "Well, you
see, sir, there be three rules for fish
ing, and 'tis no good trying it if you
don't mind them. The first is, Keep
yourself out of sight; the second is,
Keep yourself further out of sight, and
the third is, Keep yourself further out
of sight still. Then you'll do it"
Didn't Know Her.
"What has become of Miss Blank,
who was always such a favorite in
your set?"
"Her father failed some weeks ago,
and all they had was sold at auction."
"Poor thing!"
"And now they have to live in a lit
tle house In the suburbs."
"What a change! How she must feel
it!"
"Yes; She is so much changed that
even her best friends would not recog
nize her. I met her in the street to
day and did not know her at all, poor
thing."

CHELSEA'S NOTED BUNS.
t-ll London Used io Visit Mrs. Band*
on Good Friday.
However religious observances may
change in England, the eating of hot
cross buns on Good Friday is not likely
to die out Still, enthusiasm in this
particular has considerably declined
since the days when Mrs. Hands kept
the Chelsea Bun House at the corner
of Jews' row, now Plmllco road. So
many people were in the habit of flock
ing there on Good Friday in order to
eat hot cross buna that on one occasion
50,000 persons assembled there, and
£250 was taken in the day for buns
alone. After this the inhabitants of
Chelsea protested against the noise and
disturbance this caused, and Mrs.
Hands, fearing to be restrained by the
law, issued in 1703 a quaint proclama
tion, stating how, "desirous, therefore,
of testifying her regard and obedience
to those laws by which she is happily
protected, she is determined, though
much to her loss, not to sell cross buns
on that day to any person whatever,
but Chelsea buns as usual."
This Mrs. Hands was something of a
character in her own way. The royal
family and many of the aristocracy
used to visit her in the morning, and
Queen Charlotte even presented her
with a silver half gallon mug contain
ing- 5 guineas. The house remained In
the possession of her family for some
time, as Sir Richard Phillips, writing a
few years before its destruction, men
tions. After admitting that for upward
of thirty years he had never passed the
house without filling his pockets, he
goes on to say, "These buns have af
forded a competency and even wealth
to four generations of the same family,
and it is singular that their delicate
flavor, lightness and richness have nev
er been successfully Imitated." When
Ranelagh was closed, the Bun House
declined In popularity, though as late
as 1839 24,000 buns were sold on Good
Friday alone.— London Chronicle.
POWERFUL VOICES.
Some Historic Shrlekers Who Ante-
dated the Famous Stentor.
The question has often been asked,
"Who was the most loud voiced man
of history?" The answer usually is
that it was Stentor, of whom Homer
says his voice was as loud as that of
fifty other men combined and from
which we get the phrase "stentorian
voiced." But we have record of two
historic "shrlekers" anterior to Homer.
We read where Simeon and Levi fought
against the twelve men of the city of
Sarton and that Levi beheaded one
man with his own sword. In chapter
38, verse 41, of the book referred to the
story is related in the following words:
"And the sons of Jacob seeing that
they could not prevail over the twelve,
Simeon gave a loud and tremendous
shriek, and the eleven remaining men
were stunned by the awful shriek."
In chapter 39, same book, verse 19,
we find the following account of the
battles of the sons of Jacob with the
inhabitants of the city of Gaash. It
seems as though the battle was both In
the front and in the rear and that the
warriors on the wall were throwing
spears and hurling stones upon the
Eons of Jacob. What next occurred, as
related in chapter and verse above
cited, is recorded in these words:
"And Judah; seeing that the men of
Gaash were getting too heavy for
them, gave a piercing and tremendous
shriek, and all the men of Gaash 'were
terrified at Judah's cry, and men fell
from the wall at the sound of his pow
erful shriek, and all those that were
without as well as those within the
city were greatly afraid of their lives."
The Canary Is a Little Plgr.
The canary ia always regarded as a
small eater, just as the pig is notorious
for its gluttony. People with small ap
petites are often twitted for not eating
more than enough to feed a canary,
and this led a man who was a tiny eat
er to watch the yellow bird and report.
He found that a canary that weighed
247 grains ate just thirty-two times its
own weight in a month; that Is, it ate
rather more than its own weight on an
average every day. Anyone who watch
es the little bird will notice that it Is al
ways eating. Now, says the investiga
tor, a pig doesn't eat its own weight ev
ery day, glutton as it is. Hence be
thinks that the canary deserves to be
classed as a little pig.— London An

thoroughly and completely to both

two parts visible as you look down on
the town from the hills, and the life
and the ordinary traffic of the place
flow back and forth with no one ap
parently to say them nay. However,
it must not be supposed that there la

twelve feet high, and In the vicinity;
of this are always one or two guards
In civilian dress, who pay' no attention
to empty handed passersby, but will
stop any carriage or any person who'
offers to cross with a burden that
might contain dutiable material. Oc

Jcßcrion a* an Inventor.
Not many people know that Thomas
Jefferson was a great inventor. His in
ventions were all of articles of every
day use. He devised a three legged
folding camp stool that is the basis of
all camp stools of that kind today. The
stool he had made for his own use was
his constant companion on occasions of
outings. The revolving chair was bis
invention. He designed a light wagon.
A copying press was devised by him
and came into general use. He also in-
Tented an instrument for measuring
the distance he walked. A plow and a
hemp cultivator showed that his
thoughts were often on agricultural
matters. His plow received a gold med
al in France in 1790. Jefferson never
benefited financially by his inventions,
but believed they should be for the use
of every one without cost— St. Louis
