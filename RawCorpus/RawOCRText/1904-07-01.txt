French Housekeepinff.
A French cook turns any and every
thing to advantage, and many a culi
nary chef d'eeuvre Is the result of care
and skill rather than rare or costly in
gredients. .With Just a pinch of sa
vory herbs and a clear fire a cook will
turn shreds of cold meat into dellcious-
Iy appetizing morsels, gastronomic dis
crimination on the part of her patrons
keeping up the standard of excellence
If I were asked to point out the lead
ing characteristic of the French mind
I should unhesitatingly say that it is
the critical faculty, and to this faculty
we owe not only the unrivaled French
cuisine, but pleasures of the table gen
erally. Here is one Instance in point:
One quite ripe melon to the uninitiated
tastes very much like another, but. a
French, country gentleman knows bet
ter. Whenever a melon of superlative
flavor: is served he orders the seeds
to be set aside for planting. Thus the
superlative kind is propagated. The
critical faculty is ever alert in France,
warring!, with mediocrity - and - incom
pleteness.—Cornhill Magazine. -
Saved by Quick Wit.
Isabel F. Hapgood, the translator of
many of Tolstoi's books, once visited
the great Russian, and during her vis
it he told her a story of one of his an
cestors. This ancestor, an army offi
cer, was an excellent mimic. One day
he was impersonating the Emperor
Paul to a group of his friends when
Paul himself entered and for some
moments looked on, ' unperceived, .at
the antics of the young man. Tolstoi
finally turned and, beholding the em
peror, bowed his head and was silent
"Go on, sir," said Paul. "Continue
the performance."
The young man hesitated a moment,
and then,' folding his arms and imitat
ing every gesture and intonation of his
sovereign, he said: - : -*,
"Tolstoi, you deserve to be degraded,
but I remember the thoughtlessness of
youth, and you are pardoned."
The czar smiled slightly at this
speech.
"Well, be It so," he said.-Cleveland
Plain Dealer. ."
Foe's Love of Richmond.
Poe loved Richmond as he loved no
other place on earth. His happy child
hood was spent there — the only period
of his troubled life which was free
from want. Here he found bis foster
father, John Allan, who was proud of
the orphan boy, and the only mother
he ever knew, who was sweet and gen
tle with him to the end. Here were
the friends and playmates of hia boy
hood, and here lived the gentle wo
man who was the Helen of the most
beautiful of his early poems. Here,
after a first ceremony in Baltimore, he
was married by a second to the lovely
and youthful Virginia Clemm, and
here they spent the happiest year of
their married life. Here, as editor of
the Southern ' Literary Messenger, he
did much of his best work.— Charles
Marshall Graves In Century.
Where the Camel Is Fonnd.
The camel is found In Arabia, Per
sia, Asia Minor, Afghanistan, Balu
chistan, Mongolia, western China and
northern India as well as in Syria,
Turkey, north Africa and parts of
Spain. The camel Is known by the
same root word in nearly all these
lands. Not a page scarcely of an Ara
bic lexicon but has reference to the
camel. The language itself, according
to Hammer Purgstall, knows him by
6,744 names. The only reason why
Scripture is comparatively silent Is be
cause the topography of the Holy
Land Is such that in most parts the
use of the camel is an impossibility.
Letters of Introduction.
Try not to ask for letters of intro
duction to your friends' friends. It
often causes both embarrassment and
Inconvenience. If the letter of intro
duction Is offered accept It and present
it dutifully. It will not be difficult to
ascertain whether or not the person to
whom it is addressed finds the intro
duction a pleasure or a bore. It is folly
to pursue an acquaintance thus gained
unless each finds the other congenial.—
Exchange.
Altitude and Voice.
Generally speaking, races living at
high altitudes have weaker and more
highly pitched voices than those living
In regions where the supply of oxygen
Is more plentiful. Thus among -the
Indians living on the plateau between
the ranges of the Andes, at an eleva
tion of from 10,000 to 14,000 feet the
men have voices like women, and wo
men like children, and their singing Is
a shrill monotone.
Plenty of Opportunities.
' In this era of education, of books and
libraries, of newspapers and period
icals, of schools and universities, even
ing schools, lectures and the other end
less opportunities for self culture
which our country in particular af
fords all classes, there is no excuse for
Ignorance. It is only will that Is want-
Ing.— Success.

WHILE WAITING
FOR REPAIRS
WILL BURR
Copyright, 1903, by T. C. McClure
The ferry at Acton, a small summer
resort lying next a most pleasurable
stretch of lake, was operated solely
by its owner, OkT Abe, as he was •
called. The service . had ' come to be
of such an unstable character that the
villagers had lost all confidence in it
as a means of transportation.
However, Marian Ardsley, was not
an inhabitant of the village, and so
she stepped confidently aboard the
boat assisted by Old Abe. As he
bustled about, he was softly chuckling
and repeating to himself, "Two, two."
The rear third' of Abe's stern
wheeler was pilot house and engine
room, the central portion was cabin,
and in front was what may be termed
a deck. On this deck was seated, the
other of Abe's "two" passengers,
Alonzo Allen, of New York.
Allen didn't know, as a matter of
fact where he was going, nor did he
care. He had seen the old man put
tering about the boat and, on learn
ing that a start would soon be made
for somewhere, he had listlessly taken
a seat for the trip.
With a toot of the squeaky whistle
the boat got under way. Marian, wish
ing to stand in the prow, walked
through the cabin. But at sight of
her fellow passenger she turned pink
with embarrassment and quickly re
treated and sat down on the long,
carpet covered seat that was built
through the middle of the cabin.
Under the guidance of the Jubilant
old man, the boat advanced in a very
satisfactory manner— at least to him—
until about half way across the lake.
Here the paddle wheel refused to con
tinue revolving, and, after some
minutes of drifting, the boat was still.
At this point a thunder shower,
which bad for a time back been stead
ily approaching, broke over the lake.
Allen, not desiring a drenching, rose
to his feet and went into the cabin.
In the darkening interior he saw no
one, and sat down on the middle of
the seat with a sigh, putting his elbows
on his knees and face in hands.
Marian was sitting but an arm's
length from him. After an awkward
pause speut in cogitation, she coughed
lightly. Allen started to his feet di
rectly, and, with a bow. said:
"I do beg your pardon, madam; 1— "
And then a flash lighted the cabin for
an Instant and he plainly saw his com
panion's face.
"I thought I was alone," he added
simply, and awkwardly backing to the
farther end of the seat he sat down.
There was some reason for these
seemingly strange actions. It was but
the previous evening that they had
quarreled, and at the end he had
fiercely taken back the ring she prof
fered, and they had parted forever.
At length, "Why are we stopping
here?" asked Marian of the boatman,
who sat at his post In perfect tran
quillity.
"Jest a screw loose, miss," the old
man replied. "I figger I know where
'tis now, and we'll be goln' again in
a Jiffy."
And with that Old Abe, tools in
hand, climbed around to the all im
portant paddle wheel. After an ex
asperating wait of perhaps twenty
minutes, Marian peered out from the
door, and, seeing no one, called, "Mr.
Ferryman!" She was now heartily
wishing she had stayed at the house.
"I'm awful sorry, miss'," answered
the old man rather dolefully, "but
I'm afraid it'll take a teenty bit longer.
You see, it's worsen I thought"
"Do you have to stop like this
often?" asked Marian.
"Well, sometimes. But now last
week she didn't break down, Monday
nor Wednesday, all the hull way over!"
And, saying this, Old Abe rose to his
full height grinning wlth-pride.
"Well, I suppose it can't be helped,
then," submitted Marian, but she ap
peared so very much annoyed that
Abe at once leaned down and con
tinued his work with a great show of
bustle. • .
The rain was not yet over, and Allen
was busily engaged staring very hard
at nothing whatever. Marian looked
at her watch. It was past lunch time,
and, as she had felt too miserable to
eat much breakfast she commenced to
feel hungry. A sudden thought bright
ened her countenance— she had with
her a box of candles which she had
purchased for her sister's children.
She could get them another box. She
looked at her watch again. Only a
few minutes more had passed, but her
hunger had now become unbearable.
She loosed the string from the box,
opened fee paper, removed the cover
and ate a chocolate.
After she had eaten several of the
candies she glanced over at Allen.
•Fastened to the wall of the cabin op
posite him was an old landscape in a
dingy frame, and he was gazing at
this with the concentration of a stole. -
"A landscape 1" mentally exclaimed
Marian, as she recalled his dislike of
landscapes. "How he must bate me,"
she continued, eating another candy,
"when he'd rather look at that than at
mot I wonder— what had I ought to
Go? If be and I were utter strangers,
tost on a desert Isle, and he had a
dozen kernels of corn I should think
pirn a cad If be didn't offer me half.
I think I ought to offer him some of
jMeee candles, even if we're not on
Speaking terms."

aheadt Marian pushed the candy boj
•long the seat - Allen paid no attention
"Won't you have a chocolate T Ma
rian asked at length, hesitatingly.
Allen made no answer.
. "Will you"— and Marian stamped hei
little foot—'! say, wijl you have a choc
olate?" she continued Impatiently.
"No, I thank yon," he replied, and re
sumed his contemplation of .the land
scape.
j A long pause ensued. The . box re
mained half way, between them.
I "I . think you're very—ungentleman
ty," ventured Marian.
■ "Last -night you were of the same
opinion," retorted Allen.
r "Yon are more so now." ' . '
■-J "How?"
I "Well, yon— you know that I'm too
polite to eat these chocolates and let
you go hungry— and , I'm simply starv
ed."
■; . With an air of exaggerated polite
ness Allen reached over, took a candj
and ate it bis eyes fixed the while up-,
on the landscape. Marian then ate one,
waited In silence for ten minutes and
again offered the box to Allen, who
helped himself very gravely and hand
ed It back. This operation was re
peated until soon only one candy w,ae
left The remaining one was heart
shaped.
Allen handed the box to Marian. She
took the box, but directly offered 11
back to him.
. "No, thank yon," said Allen on look-
Ing In the box.
"But I am offering it to yon," Insist
ed Marian.
"It's yours," replied Allen. And h<
shot a quick glance at Marian, who
had been gradually moving from her
end of the seat and was now past the
middle. She slightly raised from hei
seat and, leaning toward him, said:
"Lon— pardon me— Mr. Allen, please
take It I want you to have It"
"Is it— do you mean— you are offer
ing me a heart?" he asked.
She might have answered, but the
boat suddenly started j with a . jerk,
throwing her full Into his arms. And
there she was when the boatman ap
peared In the doorway.
"I'm sorry for delayin' ye," said Old
Abe, "but I'm thlnkln* things be tin
kered Into shape ag'ln now." And thai
was true enough.
."We"— and Marian looked at Allen
"we're not blaming you, Mr. Ferry
man."
"No, and we'll take the trip back
with you," added Allen.
"Thank 'c; thank 'c, sir," replied Old
Abe. And as he went back to his work
there was a merry twinkle in his eye,
and he chuckled to himself:
"They're not blamln' me, but 1 could
'a' started the dura old craft Jest hall
an hour ago!"
Cooler Than Cool.
Sydney Smith's name for Moncktos
Mllnes, afterward Lord Houghton, was
"Cool of the Evening," and the reasoc
for this choice Is partly revealed in the
anecdote below, which is taken from
the "Reminiscences of a Royal Acade
mlcian."
At a London dinner given by a dis
tinguished man Sydney Smith bad the
place of honor, and Mllnes was among
the other guests.
Milnes' manner to the great wit and
divine. was lacking In the respect due
to age and position. He caimly ad
dressed him as "Smith," which every
time made those" who felt what was
proper wince as at a personal affront.
; Finally Mllues said, with something
of an nir:
"I'm poinjr on to the a rclibisbop's re
ception at Lnmbetu palace."
"Oh, nrc you? So am I." said Sydney
Smith. "May I nsk if you have a car
riage here?"
"No." snld the 'Cool of the Evening."
"Well, 1 bavp. and I sbtill be happy
to give you a seat in It. but you must
do me one favor. lion't call the arch
bishop nowlejT* ' .'.'•.» .
The voice and manner of piteous en
treaty convulsed the company and
crushed M lines, wbo' retired as soon as
possible from the table.
WrHrrM Who Were Pedestrians.
North" (Professor John
Wilson), v giant over six feet high,

.Wordsworth, though he could never

that he bad walked six times round

The Wrong Tarn,
Among the many stories told of ab
sentmlnded people there is one about
the dreamy mother of a young Ameri
can author which is well authenticat
ed, but seems almost incredible.
: One evening, when her son stopped
at the door of her room on the way to
his own to deliver, a message which
had been sent her, he discovered the
old lady in the pitchy darkness hold
ing a match under the cold water fau
cet
When she "came to herself," in re
sponse to her son's hearty laugh she
admitted that she had lighted five oth
er matches and treated them in the
same way.
"I was thinking about something
else," she said naively, "and all I knew
that I had to turn something on
before I could light the gas."
And then she added, "I don't think 1
was such a queer mistake after alii"

The Upright Jndge.
A New York magistrate and his
friend were returning from a banquet
arm in arm and were giving way to
mirth and song when they found
themselves confronted by the police.
The magistrate made his escape, but
on the following day as be sat on the
bench, "grave, dignified and alert,' as
usual," he saw his dear and valued
friend charged with being drunk and
disorderly. He listened to the charge
unmoved beyond a pained expression
on his face and, after calling upon the
prisoner to explain his conduct, ad
dressed him in his most severely judi
cial manner and In scathing tones.
Never had he heard a more disgraceful
case, and It was so much tho more dis
graceful from the fact that the pris
oner evidently was respectably con
nected and moved In what was called
(here be became very sarcastic) good
society. He felt it was a matter where
leniency would be surely out of place,
and the fine must be the maximum
which the law allowed.
Extraordinary Legal Document.
One of the most remarkable legal pa
pers on file in the archives of the world
is one now in the National museum of
Paris, labeled "Sentence on a hog, exe
cuted by justice in the copyhold of
Clarmont-Avin and strangled ' upon a
gibbet at that place." It is sealed with
red wax, kept under a glass, bears
date of June 14, 1494, and reads as fol
lows: "We, the Jury, in detestation and
horror of this crime and in order to
make an example and to satisfy jus
tice, have declared, judged, sentenced,
pronounced and appointed that the
said hog, now detained in the abbey
as a prisoner, shall by the executioner
be hung and strangled on a gibbet near
the gallows which now stands within
the Jurisdiction of the monk, being
near the copyhold of Avin. In witness
of which we have sealed this present
with our seals." Following the above
are the signatures of the Jurors and
the prefect of the department de la

An Odd Jewish Ceremony.
In the Jewish Encyclopaedia is an ac
count of the queer ceremony of the
taking off a brother-in-law's shoe by
the widow of a brother who has died
childless, through which ceremony he
Is released from the obligation of mar
rying her. The ceremony is described
as follows:
The yabam (brother-in-law) must
have his right foot on which the shoe
is placed, . washed very j scrupulously,
tnd after he has . strapped it -on he
must walk four cubits in the presence
of the Judges. Then the chief of the
Judges reads the following passage,
which the yabamah (woman) j repeats
word for word: "My brother-in-law re
fuses to raise unto his brother a name
In Israel; he will not marry me." Then
the yabam Is required to repeat the
sentence, "I do not wish to take her."
He then presses his right foot against
the floor .while she looses the straps
with her right hand, takes off the shoe
and throws it some distance away.
Then she places herself in front of tho
yabam, spits on the floor in front of
him and repeats these words after the
presiding Judge: "So shall it be done
unto that man who will not build up
his brother's house, and his name shall
be called in Israel 'the house of him
that hath his shoe loosed.' "
Poison In Walls.
"As much as 46 per cent of organic
matter has been found in plaster taken
from the walls of a hospital ward in
Paris." Statistics tell us that it is not
uncommon to find air in public assem
bly rooms and even in dwellings con
taining from ten to fifteen times the
amount of carbonic acid found in pure
air. Of this gas Tomllnson says:, "lt
acts as a poison. If we attempt to
Inhale It by putting the face over the
edge of a beer vat the nostrils and
throat are irritated so strongly that
the glottis closes and Inspiration be
comes impossible.'' One need remain
but half an hour in an unventllated
room to have Inhaled 600 times the
foul and poisonous fluid; the blood
will have carried it to every part of
the body, and the entire system will
have become saturated.— Exchange.
Tying; a Horse to a Hole.
It has been discovered that the des
ert Indians, who have never been ac
credited with superabundant wits, have
for many years employed a method of
tying their horses to holes in the
ground that Is clever, unique and ef
fective. The operation of tying a horse
to a hole seems an Impracticable and
impossible one, for there is something
decidedly intangible and unsubstantial
about the hole. The operation is per
formed in this way: Kneeling on the
hot sands, the Indians dig with their
hands until they have made a hole
about two feet deep. They then tie an
immense knot in the end of the halter
rope, lower it into the bottom of the
bole, fill the hole with sand and then
jump and stamp upon it until the earth
over the knot is about as hard as sand
stone.—London Magazine. >.." '
Cata and Cattle.
In certain parts of southern Califor
nia it is absolutely necessary to have
cats to successfully raise cattle. The
cows feed on a red clover which
makes a superior quality of beef. This
clover grew very sparsely until it was
discovered that one farmer who had
raised a large number of tabby cats
always had fine clover fields. Investi
gation proved that the cats killed the
field mice who killed the wild bees
who fertilized the clover seeds by car
rying the pollen from flower to flower,
thus causing the seeds to sprout thick
ly every year. Now all the farmers
have many cats.
Practical Economy.
A man Whose impecunious condition
is chronic and who borrows with the
airy grace of a beau in an old comedy
recently approached an acquaintance,
all smiles and geniality.
"You're Just the fellow I wanted to
see,*' he said. "Could you lend me $5
for a minute?"
"I could," said the acquaintance dry
ly, "but let me tell you how to save
that $5. Wait a minute and you won't

WHY COLORS FADE.
The Action of Light and Air Is What
Causes the Change.
The fastness of color depends on the
stability of the coloring matter as well
as on that of th« combination between
the material and the color. Nearly all
organic colors are bleached by the con
tinued action of light and ah*.' Light
alone can cause changes and favors
the formation of small quantities oi
ozone and hydrogen peroxide, especial
ly In the presence of water, which Is
always to be found in all ordinary ma
terials. ''
These two substances are powerful
oxidizing agents, readily giving up a
portion of the oxygen contained In
them, and this combines with or oxi
dizes the coloring matter, forming a
body closely allied to it but which la
less intensely colored, and in some
cases, if the action is carried fat
enough, the color is entirely destroyed.
The chemical effects of the different
colored rays vary greatly. Red, yel
low and green are practically Inert as *
bleaching agents, while blue, violet and
, ultra violet rays have a most powerful
chemical action. This fact explains why
materials which are usually worn at
night and hence are exposed only to gas
or candle light do not fade rapidly, these
llluminants not having a - preponder
ance of the blue and violet rays, while,
sunlight which contains a large propor
tion of these ' chemically active rays,
quickly affects colored fabrics.

I Keep your blood clean as you keep your
body clean. Yon don't wait ' until your
body is foul before you cleanse it v
It is a matter of surprise that many peo-
ple who are so careful to have clean bodies
make no effort to keep the blood clean.
Everyone knows that uncleanness breed*
disease; that those who do not keep their
bodies in a wholesome condition and wbo
dwell in filthy surroundings are the first to
fall when some epidemic of disease sweeps
the country.- But foul blood is more dan-
gerous to the individual than a foul body.
An unclean body is rather a passive than
an active hindrance to health. But unclean
blood is an active threat against the very
life — it makes the body a prepared breed-
ing place for disease.
■ It is part of Nature's plan for human
safety that in many cases where the blood
is impure or corrupt she sets a sign on the
body in proof of the corrupt current that is
flowing through the veins. Scrofula with
its disfiguring sores and scars, eczema with
its irritation, salt-rheum, tetter, erysipelas,
boils, pimples and other eruptions are only
the outward signs of the impurity of the
blood. But often in the earlier or simpler
stages of the blood's impurity there are no
outward signs of this condition; only dull,
languid, sluggish feelings, which are com-
monly attributed solely to the sluggishness
of the liver.
Of all preparations for purifying the
blood Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discov-
ery easily takes the first place. It elimin-
ates from the blood the elements which .
clog and corrupt it, and which breed and
feed disease. It acts directly on the blood-
making glands, increasing their activity,
and so increasing the supply of rich, pure
blood which is the life of the body.
Accept no substitnte for "Golden Med-
ical Discovery." There is nothing "juf<;
as good" for diseases of the stomael;,
blood and lungs.

ROOSEVELT AND FAIRBANKS.
The republican convention unani
mously nominated Theodore Roose
velt for president, or rather ratified
a nomination that the people of the
United States, irrespective of party,
had trade months before. Never in
the history of this country has a
nomination come to a presidential
candidate with as little opposition
as did this one. And never before
was a man who succeeded to the
presidency through the death of the
president nominated for the high
position. Roosevelt is a man of the
people, and has shown himself for
the people. The people have now
reciprocated, and by words and
deed have shown themselves to be
for Roosevelt. That he will be re
elected no one seriously doubts. The
horde of office seekers in the demo
cratic party will wage a war of mis
representation in order to secure
official positions, but the rank and
file of the party are satisfied with
the present condition of affairs aud
propose to let well enough alone.
•With Roosevelt and Jonn Hay at the
helm the foreign powers will con
tinue to tip their hats to us as we
pass by. Fairbanks for the vice
presidency is a brilliant young sen
ator from Indiana. He is a man
who has long been recognized as a
presidential possibility. The people
of his state, irrespective of party,
joined irr extending him a royal wel
come on his return after his nomina
tion. It will be no fault of the state
of Indiana if he is not the next pre
siding officer of the senate. Roose
velt and Fairbanks are' invincible.
The democratic side-show must of
necessity take place in order to keep
up appearances. And while every
thing points to the overwhelming
defeat of the democratic nominees,
the republicans will make one of the
most interesting and instructive
campaigns ever waged in a presi
dential contest. . -

Boycott in Amador.
Amador has another serious case of
the dread malady— boycott. This time
it is White's livery and feed stable that
is under the ban. We have not heard
either side of the story from the parties
directly interested, and are not able at
this time to comment upon the merits
and de-merits of the case. We hear
that it has reached such proportions
that the hotel people are afraid to ride
in one of White's rigg for fear of losing
their customers; that the town phy
sician concluded it would be an un
healthy place to keep hi 9 horse. We
are opposed to the boycott in any form.
It is un-American, and the day will
come when it will not be tolerated in
this country. Let us hope that the
parties who instigated this trouble will
think better of it and play quits, so
that the good people of little Amador
can speak as they pass by without fear
of offending some one. Otherwise
every business in the town willl be in
jured.

Teacher's Balariei.
The Stockton City Board of Educa
tion has placed itself squarely on record
concerning the compensation of teach
ers in the public schools. Incidentally
the members of the board, submitting
a report, have hit upon so many topics
of general concern that their reasoning
and presentation of facts have more
than the ordinary interest. The mini
mum salary of Stockton's grade teach
ers is raised from $500 to $600 per an
num, while the maxiutn grade salary
Is raised from $850 to $900. The sal
aries of the principals of the smaller
schools are increased from $900 to $1000.
In the High school certain salaries are
advanced.
Among the conclusions reached by
the board some are worth attention
throughout the State. It is set up as
an axiom that among the requisites of
teachers are tact In management, an
even and kindly disposition and the
health, strength and ability and in
clination for constant improvement.
Added to these specifications the board
holds it to be essential that teachers
shall be possessed of a moral character
above reproach aud that they shall
have a social training as shown in per
sonal manners, habits and dress that
will present a good example to the
children.
The action of the board in raising
salaries is based upon several consid
erations. Stated concisely, these are
that the growing compensation of the
Stockton teachers has not kept pace
with the higher standards of work de
manded in the schools; that the more
extended training now required takes
from two to six years more time than
was formerly necessary to properly
equip the teacher; that during the pe
riod when the cost of living has in
creased there has been marked advance
in the salaries in all lines of professional
work with the exception of those for
teaching; that the time and expense
Involved In becoming a competent
teacher equal such outlays in fitting
for any other profession; that teachers
have a right to a support that bears a
just relation to the kind of work they
are doing and to the ability ueeded to
do It well.
HOW IT WORKS.
( From the BakersQeld Californian. )
Stockton boasts that it pays the best
teacher's salaries in the State, and the
Mail adds that that city has a teaching
force second to none. That necessarily
follows. The best teachers are natur
iilly looking for the place that pays the
best salaries.— Call.
Agricultural Education.
The movement to secure an agri
cultural education through the public
schools of the country is steadily in
creasing and from time to time mani
fests Itself through unusual channels.
At the recent convention of the Travel
ers' Protective Association at Spring
field, Illinois, addresses were made on
this subject and the association voted
to present the matter before the
National Educational Association at its
coming annual convention at St. Louis.
The Travelers' Association passed a
comprehensive resolution setting forth
that the stability of our social and
business conditions and the prevention
of recurring periods of trade depression
require that the balance of our popula
tion should be maintained on the land
as independent home owners and pro
ducers from the soil, and that ways
should be found and carried out for
placing upon the land all unemployed
labor and transforming every "out-of
work" Into the owner of a home on the
land from which he can at all times
get a comfortable living with his own
labor. It was set forth that the entire
American educational system should be
so remodeled as to induce every child
to be a lover of nature and of the coun
try, and to train him toward the land
as a source of livelihood rather than
away from it; that children should be
taught to farm as they are now taught
In France and Denmark In the public
schools, and that farm training schools
should be established by county,
municipal, state and national govern
ments.
The resolution further called atten
tion to the great remaining public
domain in the west as by far the most
valuable asset of this nation wfhich will
furnish an outlet for our surplus labor
during this and coming generations,
urging that it be reserved for real
homebuilders who will farm it in small
tracts.
The association appointed a perman
ent committee on education, irrigation,
forestry and land, with a member from
each state and territory to carry out
the idea of this resolution.
No More Saloons to be Started in Lodi.
Lodi is to have no more saloons. An
application was made some time ago
by Louis Wetmore to conduct a saloon
there, and the hearing was postponed
from time to time. A couple of weeks
ago Rev. G. H. DeKay, of the Congre
gational church, appeared before the
supervisors with a numerously-signed
petition, but enough names were not
on it, and the board gave the revenend
gentleman two weeks in which to se
cure the requisite number.
In the meantime the man who wanted
the saloon got busy and interviewed a
number of those who had signed the
petitioD, • and succeeded in having
eleven persons withdraw their names,
stating that they had signed It under
a misapprehension. The district at
torney, however, held that these sign
ers had no license to withdraw their
names, and the supervisors accordingly
denied the application.
In Sacramento county the board of
supervisors allowed a similar move in
the Conley case, allowing signers to
withdraw their names, and now the
people of San Joaquln are wondering
if the same lawß are not applicable to
all parts of the state. — Sacramento Bee.

American Boy Day at tne St. Lonii
Expo.ition.
The St. Louis Exposition manage
ment wisely determined to recognize
American boys by setting apart a spe
cial day for them at the Exposition.
The day selected is July sth, and the
program aud arrangements for the
day are hi the hands of William C.
Sprague, editor of the American
boy, of Detroit. The program Includes
athletic contests in the stadium be
tween the boys of the public schools,
In which public school teams are enter
ed from Chicago, New York and other
cities, and opportunities will be given
for individual entries. From 2:30 to
4:30 In tne afternoon public exercises
will be held in Festival Hall, the cen
tral attraction of the grounds. It is
expected that three thousand boys will
take part in a unique program, con
sisting of orations, recitations, music,
etc., by talented boys from various
parts of the country, the reading of
messages from President Roosevelt
and the governors of all the states and
territories, music by one of the Exposi
tion bands aud by Professor H. B.
Roney, who will preside at the great
organ— the largest in the world. Three
thousand boys will be heard in chorus
singing patriotic songs. There will be
an address of welcome by President
Francis, a responce by an 11-year-old
boy, and a salute to the flag. Prizes
will be awarded to boys competing in
the contest for the best poem on the
subject, "The American Boy,"- and
the best song that can be sung to the
tune America. At 4:30 o'clock the boys
will form in possession and march to
the Pennsylvania building, where they
will pay their respects to the oid Lib
erty Bell, and a 10-year-old boy will
crown the bell with a floral offering
on behalf of the boys of america. At
5:30 o'clock a reception will be given
the boys in the Michigan building. It
Is fair to say that every boy in the
country who can be at the Fair on July
sth will try to be there, as the occasion
will be one long to be remembered.

Democratic Convention.
On July 6th the democratic national
convention will meet in the city of St.
Louis. John Sharp Williams will be
the temporary chairman, and will take
great pleasure, and perhaps a long
time, to tell the unterriGed what it
will be Impossible for them to do In the
coming campaign. The speaker will
receive thunderous applause whether
he is heard or not, and the speech will
be heralded In democratic circles as one
of the most brilliant ever delivered in
a national convention. Scores of candi
dates will be present willing to lead - a
forlorn hope, simply to satisfy their
own personal vanity. Parker, Hearst,
Bryan and Cleveland have been scoring
for some time, but neither seems to be
1n fit condition to go against Roosevelt.
Many dark borses are being groomed
and tried out, but so far no suitable
entry has been discovered, ring-bone
or bone-spavin developing at the. last
moment. In the end good old Gen.
Miles or Geo. B. McClellan, the son of
his father, may be selected. Scott and
Hancock ended their brilliant military
careers by making unsuccessful stands
for the presidency, and it might be well
to give Miles an opportunity to do the
same. John Sharp Williams bas been
spoken of for the vice-presidency, but
he has shown himself to be "Shafp
John Williams" and respectfully de
clined . If no eastern man can be se
cured to accept the latter position the
convention can confer the honor upon
almost any one of the California dele
gates or send it by proxy to Franklin
K. Lane, who will accept it with thanks
and go down to defeat as gracefully in
November as he has in his last two
political ventures. The platform will
consist of a large mass of generalities.
A clause will be inserted to catch the
labor vote; the negroes will be held in
loving embrace until after elction; the
prohibitionists will be told that cold
water is the strongest beverage that an
honest democrat can swallow; corpora
tions, trust., and monopolies will be
trampled under foot in one clause, and
shown to be the foundation stones of
our government In the next. Silver
will be declared to be the money of the
people, and gold the only standard
that any progressive nation can adopt
and retain its credit with the great
powers of the world. The tariff plank
will be for high and low, protection and
free trade reciprocity, or any old thing
by which astray vote might be secured.
The Chinese and foreign emigration
generally will be looked after, and the
railroads will receive their usual left
handed jabs. The whole will be an im
mense volume of tanglefoot with a
coating of supposed mucilage that will
be easy to crawl out of. - ■
There is more catarrh in this section
of the country than all other diseases
put together, and until the last few
years was supposed to be incurable.
For a great many years doctors pro
nounced it a local disease, aud prescrib
ed local remedies, and by constantly
falling to euro with local treatment,
pronounced It incurable. Science has
proven catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti
tutional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
Cure, manufactured by F. J. Cheney
& Co., Toledo, Ohio, is the only consti
tutional cure on the market. It is taken

Oiled Koadi.
D. MuCall has about completed the
first part of his contract for oiling the
road between Jackson and lone. The
first coat makes quite an impression
since it has become thoroughly mixed
with the dust. From MarteU's into
town, where the road has been covered
with a good coating of rock, the oil
seems to have had tho effect of cement
ing the rock together and making a
decided improvement. Where the
dust was heavy for li^ht driving we
prefer the oil to the dust, hut some of
the drivers of the freight, teams con
tend that tho oil has a tendency to
make their loads pull heavier. There
are good arguments for and against the
oiling of tbe roads, but Supervisors
Moore aud Newman decided to oil and
hired Mr. McCall to do the work under
their special supervision. Just when
the second coat will be applied we were
unable to learn. Let those who travel
over the roads judge with impartiality
of the effects of oiling, and if in favor
of the judgment of tbe supervisors give
them credit. If unfavorable place the
blame where it bolougs. Oiler.
Plymouth Celebration.
Not for years in Amador county has
a committee worked bo earnestly and
harmoniously to make an undertaking
a success as has the one selected to
carry out the program outlined for the
coming celebration in Plymouth. We
understand that at the commencement
of this week nearly everything was
ready, and that not a word of discord
had been uttered to mar the speedy
completion of all arrangements. Every
one who can should show their patrio
tism and appreciation of the work done
by the Plymouth people to appropri
ately colebrate the glorious old 4t.h by
adding their presence to the occasion.
It will take the entire day to carry out
the program, so that there will not be
an uninteresting moment from morning
until after the dance is ended in the
early morning of the sth. Literary
exercises and parade in the morning,
all kind.s of amusements in the after
noon, and fireworks and horribles in
the evening. Don't miss this oppor
tunity to celebrate. Go early and re
main all day.
Jackson vs. Lodi.
On Sunday last two games of base
ball were played between Burgin "s
Jackson team and a picked nine from
Lodi. Both games resulted in a victory
for the Jackson nine. The first game
was a close out 4 , every run made being
well earned by tho player making it.
But four errors were made durirg tho
game, and it was baseball all tho way
through. Grillo pitched a good game,
and Cassella proved a happy surprise
for all his associates. Score 10 to 6 in
favor of Jackson.
The afternoon game boded ill for the
visiting team from the start. The
home nine made 6 runs the first inning
and were never headed. The Lodi
boys are jolly good fellows and we hope
to see them come again. The score
for the last game stood 16 to 9 in favor
of Jackson.
Selling Trout.
Sage Hartwick. of Amador, was ar
rested Monday evening by Constable
Tuttle upon a warrant sworn to by
Game Warden Arditto for selling fish
unlawfully. Mr. Hartwick and son
went to the lakes last week and suc
ceeded in catching about 50 dozen fish.
On Sunday he drove into Sutter Creek
with his catch and some one notified
the warden. Arditto went to Sutter
at once to secure evidence. We under
stand that he secured a dozen lish from
a party that claimed to have bought
them from Hartwick. On tho other
hand we hear that Hartwick gave some
of his friends fish, and they realizing
that he had been to considerable ex
pense donated 50 cents each for ex
penses. The case will come before
Judge Rose Saturday.
Marriage Licenses.
The following marriage licenses have
been issued from the county clerk's
office during the week: George W.
Sheppard to Mary L. McKenzie, both
of Defender; Walter A. Hale to Mary
A. Keffer, both of Volcano; Wilson
Crail to Ella Crail, both of Lancha
Plana.
Fire at Sutter.
A fire started in the dry grass in
Werner's field last week, and for a time
threatened to consume the large fields
of standing barley belonging to Geo.
Waeschter. A large force of men
gathered at the scene, and by heroic
fighting succeeded in keeping the fire
under control until nightfall, when the
dampness assisted in putting it out.
The origin of the fire is not known. It
was first noticed creeping from a ravine
at the foot of the hill. Perhaps the
small boy with the cigarette could
throw some light upon the subject.
Surprise Party.
On Monday evening a number of
ladies, members of the Degree of Honor,
gave Mr. and Mrs. Melvin Ford a real
surprise. Mrs. Ford was home alone
when the party arrived, and could not
imagine at first what it all meant. She
sent for Mr. Ford and a most enjoy
able evening was spent. The ladies
presented Mrs. Ford with a handsome
lemonade set and a beautiful cake plate.
After wishing the young couple many
years of happiness and prosperity the
visiting ladies departed for their re
spective homes.

THE AMADOB LEDGKEK: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FBIDAY, JULY 1, 1904.
A TRIP TO THE
WORLD'S FAIR
Notes by the Way.
St. Louis, June 21.
Salt Lake church authorities take
pride in showing visitors around Tem
ple block, in which all the principal
buildings of the church are located.
Several persons are employed to con
duct strangers through the "different
buildings, and explain the points of in
terest. No charge is made, at least to
the visitors, for this service. Natur
ally almost every tourist makes for
church block. He cannot help noticing
it, as it takes up an entire block, and
the blocks of Salt Lake are roomy to
conform with the streets. First we
passed through the Deseret Museum,
where curios and relics of early days of
Mormonism are kept, and where souv
enirs may be purchased. Next comes
the assembly hall, used for both re
ligious and secular meetings. It is
much smaller than the Tabernacle, al
though its seating capacity is from
1500 to 2000. The Tabernacle, although
constructed in the pioneer days, is still
a wonderful structure — one of the archi
tectural curios of the world. It is 250
feet long by 150 wide, and eliptical in
shape, and 70 feet from floor to the
highest point of the ceiling. The roof
is the most striking feature. It is an
oval arch, without supporting. columns
of any kind, and is still claimed to be
the largest self-supporting roof, con
structed entirely of wood, in the world.
The ceiling is of plaster, and so well
did the artisans do their work that
while 40 years have passed not a crack
is noticeable. Like all the buildings in
Temple square the tabernacle is built
exclusively of Utah material, the wood
for its dome roof being all hand-sawed.
Everybody has heard of the Tabernacle
organ. It covers as much space as a
good-sized house, and when completed
was the largest in America, if not in
the world. This also is constructed
wholly of wood, and the product of
Mormon artisans. A young lady, who
is training herself for the position of
organist, was engaged in practicing at
the time of our visit, so we had the
pleasure of listening to its melodious
voice. We say voice, because at inter
vals we were unable to detect the
strains that were sent forth as other
than the product of that most potent
of all musical instruments— the human
voice.
The guide claimed that the acoustic
properties of the tabernacle are perfect.
Government experts have been sent to
find out if possible wherein the secret
lies; they were just as much at sea
when they got through as when they
commenced their task.. The secret is
past finding out. Church zealots are
inclined to regard it as a special inter
position of divine providence in their
behalf. That it has remarkable hear
ing properties is beyond question.
While we were there' a man stationed
200 feet away faintly whispered a few
words, and thereafter dropped a pin on
a desk. We heard the whisper; some
present said they heard the pin as it
struck the desk, but this was too faint
to reach the writer's hearing.
The temple is the "holy of holies"
in Mormon estimation. No gentle feet
are permitted to tread its threshold .
Indeed, comparatively few church
members are allowed to enter its sacred
portals. We had to be content with
the guide's brief descriptive statement
and a view of its massive exterior. It
was commenced in 1853 and dedicated
just 40 years thereafter. It is built en
tirely of Utah granite, and has six
towers. The central tower is 222J feet
high, surmounted by a statue of a gos
pol herald in the act of blowing a trum
pet—symbolical of the introduction of
the latter day dispensation by the Mor
mons. This figure is made of copper,
and a mammoth incandescent lamp
sparkles from its summit at night. The
guide stated that the precious histori
cal records of the church were housed
in the Temple, and the peculiar rites
of the priesthood, of baptism and mar
riage are solemnized therein.
By the street car route we took in as
much of Salt Lake city as it was pos
sible to see during our brief stay. Sat
urday morning we returned to Ogden,
and there boarded the U. P. train for
Denver, arriving in that city Sunday
at 11 o'clock a. m. The trip from
Cheyenne to Denver was a surprise, as
it overturned all preconceived ideas
that Colorado was essentially and al
most exclusively a mineral producing
state. Our train stopped, three hours
in Denver, and we happened to get out
side the depot in time to catch a street
car placarded "Seeing Denver," which
we boarded for the sake of whiling
away the leisure hours. It was a most
pleasurable and instructive trip, oc
cupying two hours, and together with
the explanation given by a guide
through a speaking trumpet gave a
better idea of this giant city of the west
than could be gained by a week of tour
ing by the ordinary street car. ' 'See
ing Denver" is an enterprise inaugurat
ed by a corporation. Its stockholders
are residents not of Colorado merely
but of many other states. Its field of
operations is not Denver alone, but a
number of other cities, including Salt
Lake. It is extending the list of prom
inent cities as fast as possible. San
Francisco has nothing to compare with
it, and we believe not a city in Cali
fornia is possessed of such a service.
That it is an advertising medium of
great value no one who has taken the
"Seeing Denver" trip will doubt.
Every passenger was impressed by
that panorama of realities of the vast
resources . of Colorado. We saw a
birdseye view of Denver, with its 180,000
inhabitants, of its productive valleys—
the Arkansaw and Clear creek; of its
hoarded treasures of water for power
by the sight of Pike's peak lifting its
snowy crown 14,200 feet above sea level,
at a distance of 75 miles away ; a valu
able practical lesson of what a little ir
rigation will accomplish in a seemingly
sterile soil. On one side of a street in
Denver the sagebrush land was seen in
its native barreness; on the other side
a stream of water had Imparted vitality
to dead land and had transformed it
into a flourishing nursery, which was
sending forth its fruit trees and other
products to every part of the state.
Colorado leads all sister states in min
eral output. It will surprise many to
be informed— as the trumpeteer on the
"Seeing Denver" car told us— that her
agricultural output even now far ex
ceeds her mineral output in value. This
"Seeing Denver" plan of advertising is
one that might be followed with profit
by the large cities of California.
We arrived in St. Louis Monday
night. Have taken to-day in getting
settled. Have taken a flying trip over
the Fair grounds and the Pike, and ex
pect to commence systematically to
morrow. R. W.

Death of H. J. Deacon-
H. J. Deacon, an old and well known
resident of this county, died at his home
in this city last Friday morning. His
death, although not entirely unexpect
ed, is deeply felt in the community for
be has been a respected resident here
for a long number of years. He passed
away at the age of 6(3 years, after a life
of usefulness and rearing a family. His
occupation was that of a mill man, and
the last position he held was that of
foreman in the Kennedy mill. For over
40 years he has lived in the county, and
for about 30 years was foreman of the
old Eureka mill in this city. The cause
of death was due to infirmities of a
number of years standing.
Deceased was a member of Henry
Clay Lodge No. 95, F. & A. M., and
the funeral services in this place on
Saturday were conducted by that or
der, Rev. Tuson assisting in his proper
capacity. On Sunday the remains were
accompanied to Stockton by M. Brinn
and W. H. Gonzolas, and interred in
that cemetery in the afternoon.
The wife of the deceased survives him*
as well as two sons, Edgar and Hiram,
and two daughters, Mrs. Kramer of
Stockton and Mrs. Baughman of Oak
land. — Record.
Returned Monday.
Mr. Alex. Eudy an* bride, (Nellie
Adams ) returned Monday after an ex
tended wedding tour through the east
ern states. The young couple visited
many of our most important cities,
spending several days in St. Louis, tak
ing in the World's Fair. They were
welcomed on their return by the small
boys with tin horns, and later in the
evening by many of their intimate
friends. On Wednesday evening about
sixty of the young men and ladies gave
them a regular old fashioned charivari.
Mr. Eudy was prepared for them and
many of the boys speak in enthusiastic
praise of their reception. The happy
couple will begin house-keeping at once.

NOTES FROM
GOLD MINES
Madeone— The mill will start about
the 10th of the month. Everything
looks favorable for a long profitable
run.
Glenn — The Glenn is still shut
down owing to a lack 'of water. The
Robinson brothers' lease expired on
the first of the month. The mill will
not be started again before fall.
Marsino Gravel Claim — - This
claim is developing beyond expecta
tions. The gravel is carrying more
and heavier gold. What is needed is a
small mill with which to crush the gold
bearing lava and the output would
doubtless bo much greater.
Defender— While the Defender is
still a paying proposition Supt. Joyce
concluded to sink and develop the
property at a lower level. He has gone
down 20 feet during the last two weeks
which he considers good work owing
to the granite formation. ■He will
probably sink 100 feet before running
any crosscuts. The shaft will then be
400 feet deep. Mr. Joyce is very Ban
gulne of success.
..South. Eureka.— Since our last
issue we have learned from one high in
authority, in the management of the
mine, that 40 men are now employed
doing repair and development work,
that the mill has undergone repairs
and will be running again before the
end of the present week, that
arrangements have been made for the
erection of a new mill at an early date
and that since the election of the ' new
Board of Directors in March the stock
has increased 100% in value.
New Hap of Amador County.
A new map of Amador county is in
process of construction and is about
half completed, and if a very reason
able proposition, which will be pre
sented to the supervisors at their next
meeting, be favorably considered, the
new map will be on the market in less
than 60 days. The work is being done
by D. C. Carlton, an expert map maker,
who has been in the employ of the
Rand McNalliys of Chicago for years,
and has lately made maps of Butte,
Sutter, Yuba and San Joaquin counties,
and has a map to make of Santa Cruz
county. He also made a small map of
Lodi, and there became acquainted
with Geo. W. LeMoin, the well-known
hotel man of that place, and was in
duced by him to look over the ground
in Amador, as Mr. LeMoin believed
that as it had been some years since the
last county map was made a good up
to-date map of the county would be ap
preciated by the public, and it is
wholly upon his representations to Mr.
Carlton that Amador county is very
likely to have a map that will fill all
requirements however exacting. The
new map will be about 4x6 feet in size,
and scale 1} inches to the mile. New
features will be the bounding of all
school districts and naming them.
Complete maps of Jackson, lone, Sut
ter, Amador, and Plymouth. to occupy
the vacant space on the map north and
south of the county. These maps will
be drawn to a scale and show all streets,
blocks, lots, distances, etc., also all
telephone, telegraph, and power lines.
Although Mr. LeMoin resides in Lodi
he always speaks of Amador as home,
and that he takes a great interest in
the welfare of the county is shown by
the fact that he came up to Jackson
with Mr. Carlton on Tuesday last and
personally used his best endeavors to
thoroughly introduce him, as far as his
limited time would allow, to the lead
ing people of Jackson and Sutter, and
to acquaint them understandingly with
details concerning the new map. Mr.
Carlton is stopping at the National,
and will be pleased to meet any one
who is interested in the work, and glad
to have any data furnished that will
assist in producing a complete, accurate,
and comprehensive map of Amador
county. D.

Coleman— Jnka Nuptials.
On Sunday, June 19, 1904. at high
noon, Joseph Coleman and Mrs. Louisa
Juka were united in the holy bonds of
matrimony by Father Horgan in the
Catholic church in Jackson. Friends
and relatives of the contracting parties
were present in such number as to tax
the sacred edifice to its fullest seating
capacity. Richard Hickson acted as
best man and Mrs. Carrie Leoneasio as
best lady. The ceremony was very
beautiful. At 6 o'clock p. m. about 30
persons sat down to a sumptuous wed
ding dinner at the home of the bride.
Singing and merry making were en
gaged in until a late hour. The small
boys with their tin horns and cow bells
also put in an appearance and were
royally treated by the groom.
Mrs. Coleman is a native daughter of
Amador county, having been born in
Volcano 26 years ago. She has lived
in Jackson for the past thirteen years,
where she Is well and favorably known
by many of our best citizens. Mr.
Coleman was for nine years a member
of the First Infantry U. S. army, and
rose to the rank of sergeant. He was
stationed at the Presidio for Sve years.
After the Spanish- American war he
resigned his commission and - received
an honorable discharge marked "Ex
cellent." He is a young man of gen
tlemanly appearance and a thorough
mechanic. The many friends of the
happy couple will no doubt be pleased
to learn that Mr. Coleman expects to
engage in business in Jackson and
make this their future home.
Notice to Taxpayers.
Property holders will please take
notice that for the next two months I
will be at my office in the court house,
Jackson, for the purpose of receiving

A Trip East.
U. G. Spagnoli, pharmacist at the
Spagnoli drug store, was sent from
Jackson as a delegate to the grand par
lor N. S. G. W. at Vallejo. While
, there he met with many who were en
thusiastic over the St. Louis exposition,
and at the close of the session joined a
party and went east to visit relatives
in Plttsburg and take (n the great fair.
Mr. Spagnoli was absent from tho state
about two months, and during that
time saw a great deal of the country.
He spent three weeks in Pittsburg and
six days at the fair. He went by way
of the Denver and Rio Grande and re
turned on the North Western Pacific.
He enjoyed stopover privileges both
ways. There were 20 cars filled with
passengers in the east-bound trip. He
speaks enthusiastically over California's
prospect of winning first prize. Water
and punch flow freely in every depart
ment of the building. During his ab
sence he met Prof, I. W. Kerr, for
merly of Jackson, and says that the
old gentleman is enjoying the very best
of health. Mr. Spagnoli will take
pleasure in giving information regard
ing the fair to any one who contem
plates making the trip, and estimates
the cost including a 10 days' stay at
the fair at $135.
Beet Sugar Factory.
■ The town of Colusa, in the Sacra
mento valley, is to have a beet sugar
factory that will cost $400,000. Local
capitalists have subscribed for one-half
the stock, and the outside promoters,
under the lead .of Mr. Dyer, have
pledged the other half. Mr. Dyer
visited numerous localities and con
sidered this the most favorable one In
the valley. It is enterprises of this
character that help to place any city
or town on a solid foundation. Every
permanent village must have more than
one industry to depend upon, and the
time to open up a new enterprise is
when the place is in a flourishing con
dition.

William Crosby and Miss Katie Bund
were successful applicants in the recent
grammar grade examination.
The 50th anniversary of Odd Fellow
ship was appropriately celebrated on
the evening of the 22d of June by a
program, banquet and dance. It had
been the intention of the lodge to give
a picnic on that day, but owing to the
prevalence of smallpox it was given up.
At the last moment the banquet and
dance were decided upon. .A most en
joyable evening was spent, and will
long be remembered by those present.
Supervisor Grillo accompanied' the
Jackson fishing party to the lakes, and
in his enthusiasm over the "fish pro-,

100 dozen, he forgot to stake his horses
securely and they took their departure
for pastures more green. Left in a -
mountainous country where the hoot
of the owl is something awful, he sent '
for his brother Frank to come to his
rescue at once. Frank started Satur
day evening with. a fresh team, and
landed his lonely brother safe into the
arms of loving friends and relatives late
the next evening.
Grillo, Bradshaw, Santirfo and Tarn,

Private O'Day's
Humiliation
JAMES FENNIMORE
ComirtOto, I**, 6v T. C. Mcaure
Private O'Day, of the Tenth, had
shown pluck in several fights with the
Indians, and, therefore, stood well
with his officers. He was a man who
always had a song in his heart or a
Joke on his lips, and he was, there
fore, a favorite with his fellow pri
vates. Now and then he got tight, but
unless the officer of the day was
obliged to take official notice nothing
was heard from it. .Now and then he
was guilty of other breaches of disci
pline, but he argued his case so well
before the colonel that he was let ofi'
with a reprimand where another would
have been sent to the guardhouse. In
every soldier company there is always
one such man— a good fighter when
fighting is to be done, but irresponsi
ble, good natured and totally careless
when in barracks.
A funny thing happened one day. It
was funny even to Private O'Day, as
he tried his best to look at it in a
serious light He fell in love with
Kitty Cline, the major's daughter. He
fell in love with her at a distance
clear across the parade ground at Fort
Sherman. She had been at the fort
for three or four weeks, but that was
his first Bight of her. She was eight
een and O'Day was thirty; she was a
major's daughter, used to a life of
luxury, while he was a high private
on $13 per month. The social gulf
between them was as wide as the At
lantic ocean, and O'Day knew it, and
whispered in his own ear:
"Patrick O'Day, ye are a bigger don
key than ever ye left behind ye in old
Ireland, and ye ought to be taken out
and kicked across the parade ground.
The idea of losing yer heart to such
a gurl as that! Are yez glttin' soft in
the top of yer head, or is It the foolish
ness just comin' out that yer dear
mother always contended was more
than yer common sense? Out upon ye
for a ninny, Patrick O'Day, and do ye
drive the major's darlin' out of yer
head and heart and make up to the
laundress of barracks No. 3." ! .*■ ■ ;;
But It was one thing to talk and an
other to do. Private O'Day was hard
hit— so hard that he could not keep his
secret, and when it became known to
a dozen of his comrades he was guyed
and jeered and berated by turns. Two
or three days of it ought to have work
ed a cure and sent Patrick along to bar
racks No. 3, -where the widow laun
dress of Company B, who was known
to have $450 in the bank, would have
welcomed him with smiles. It failed,
however, and In his desperation the
soldier lover did a foolish thing. Being
on sentry duty at tbe gate one day,
he removed his cap and bowed to the
major's daughter as she rode forth
on her pony. He did more. He had a
twenty-five cent box of candy in the
bosom of his Jacket, purchased for the
occasion, and he hauled it forth and
begged her to accept it as a slight to
ken of his feelings toward her. Of
course she looked down upon htm with
feelings of amazement and refused
his gift, and, of course, some one wit
nessed the performance and told of it,
and Private O'Day was sent to the
guardhouse for making a monkey of
himself.
The next morning the soldier, whose
loving heart had been deeply grieved
by the rejection of his confectionery,
was detailed to police duty along
with other derelicts, and that was a
further humiliation. The finishing
blow was at hand. After some gen
eral work about the parade grounds
be was set to cleaning up the major's
back yard, Just where the major's
daughter could have a full view of
niru as he rolled the ash barrels about,
And though he bad no cause to believe
that she was peeping from a rear win
dow and chuckling over his discom
fiture, the Iron entered his soul in
stead of the shovel entering the ash
neap. He was sharply reprimanded
two or three times by the corporal, and
in his despair and desperation he out
raged military discipline by "sussing
back." He was ordered to report him
self at the guardhouse as under new
arrest, and it was while making his
way to that popular and well known
resort that he suddenly decided to
make a bolt for it A citizen had rid
den into the fort on a fine piece of
horseflesh and thrown the reins over
a post near the gate, and Private
O'Day reached and mounted the ani
mal and was galloping away before
the sentinel at the gate had opened
and shut his mouth.
There was delay In following the
fugitive, and when pursuit was made
he had a long start, and his trail was
lost as he rode through the scrub to
ward Devil's canyon. It was 10
o'clock In the forenoon when he gal
loped out of tbe fort and it was an
hour later, and he had covered eight
miles of ground, when he rode Into
the western mouth of the canyon. He
wanted to dodge pursuit for a time,
and he wanted, a quiet place in which
to do some thinking. There was a
6ec6nd reason, and that was that a
thunderstorm was coming up from
the southwest and Private O'Day
never got his Jacket wet when there
was a chance to keep It dry. He could
nnd a dozen places In the grim,
dark canyon where he would b« shel
tered from the threatened downpour.
Unknown to the soldier who had
monkeyed with the buzzsaw, the ma
jor's daughter had ridden forth on her
ppny two or three hours previous to
his appearance as one of the sanitary
dquad, and If he hadn't been so busy
nursing his grounded heart he would

have noticed the hoof prints leading
him all the way. The girl had done
a foolish thing to ride down into that
somber gorge, where the ; cinnamon
bear hid away for his noonday sleep
and great lizards crawled up and
down and hissed at the serpents, but
she was a girl of whims, and this was
one of them. She not only entered the
canyon's mouth, but forced her won
dering and frightened pony along over
the stony trail until she could no lon
ger see daylight unless looking up
ward. She- was halted there when the
thunder began to roll and the light
ning to flash, and she had not yet
turned her horse when Private O'Day,
farther down and off his horse and un
der the shelter of a ledge, heard a
sound no man forgets after hearing it
once. The big black cloud, with its
tens of thousands of barrels of water,
had hit tbe peak of the mountain and
burst, and the jar and roar of it was
followed by the swishing and swash
ing of a torrent coming down the can
yon. The soldier had sprung for his
horse to mount and away when he
heard the clatter of the pony's hoofs,
and next moment the animal slipped
and fell at his feet and flung Us rider
over its head. O'Day saw that it was
a girl, but without knowing her iden
tity he picked her up us she lny in an
unconscious state, placed her on the
saddle before him and made the race.
The waters were throwing spray clear
over him as ue debouched from the
canyon's mouth and wheeled to the
left.
"My mon." snld the major to him
that afternoon after calling him to
headquarters. "I want to shake hands
with you and call you a brave man
and tell you how grateful I am. You
are .released from arrest, and no new
charges are pending. As to anything
further"—
"The widdy woman who launders
for barracks No. 3 and has $450 in
bank promised an hour ago to marry
me, and there will be no 'anything fur
ther' to it!" replied Private O'Day as
he saluted and turned on his heel.
The Quarrel of the Humorists.
Soon after Sir Francis C. Burnand
became the editor of Punch he pub
lished a skit on George Augustus Sala
which cleverly burlesqued his methods
and manner. Sala was connected with
the London Illustrated News. As he
was distinguished alike for hufflness
and for geniality, there was much talk
about how he would take the joke.
One evening Sala and Burnand met
at the Beefsteak club, and Snla, to the
mingled consternation and amusement
of the gallery, referred with indigna
tion to the article.
"If I were younger," he said, "I'd
pull the nose of any man responsible
for such an article."
A peacemaker intervened, to whom
Burnand remarked that personally he
did not think this or any matter in
journalism worth quarreling about,
but that if Sala felt so aggrieved he
could take the matter Into his own
hands. • •
"I will!" Sala Immediately cried. "I
willl"
And, springing up excitedly, he car
ried out his intention— by wringing his
own nose, first with one hand, then
with the other. Then, after murmur-
Ing, "I apologize," he quietly sat down.
Then it came out that the affair was
a farce planned and rehearsed, by Sala
and Burnand and that Sala had writ
ten the article himself.
An Adirondack Thief.
At a certain Adirondack cottage last
season something disturbed things frc- 1
quently. A jar of butter, set under the
house to keep cool, was broken into;
a tub of beef in process of corning was
robbed; a jar of suet on the back
piazza was tipped over, broken and
some of the fat eaten, and many other
depredations of like character were
committed. Several times the robber
had been seen in the evening by ladies
of the family, and to them he looked
so big that the male contingent deter
mined to watch for the thief and stop
his thieving. Opportunity came one
moonlit night.
Seen through a window and stretch
ed over a pail in the shadow, the ani
mal looked big as a half bushel. But
he could not be shot Just there, and so
the broken jar of suet was placed in
the moonlight in range of an open
■window, and, gun in hand, the avenger
waited. He did not have to wait long.
Quietly and with great dignity, as
though entirely within his rights, Mr.
Coon came out of the woods again
right along the path to the house— and
stopped to regale himself with the suet,
60 easily found in its new place. Ac
counts were squared when the shot
gun spoke.— Forest and Stream.
Honeymoon Hint*.
Do not forget, little wife, to pack up
a goodly store of books and work, aa
well as your pretty trousseau.
Do not, because it is just for once
in your lives, spend more than you
ought to either on the trip or for inci
fiental expenses. Many a yoilug couple
after the honeymoon bitterly repent
their reckless waste of money.
Do not, even at this eventful stage
of your life, expect "the dear boy" al
ways to be by your side. The love
which he has for you, and which has
caused you to make him "the happiest
fellow on earth," will not admit of him
neglecting you, and his little atten
tions to others In public must be ac
cepted as mere conventionalities. Do
not forget that you have left others
behind you to whom your marriage
has been almost as great a matter of
moment as to yourself— those whose
happiness depends upon yours. In
epite of this new existence, in which
two lives are as one, you should find
time to write to them.
Do not fail to remember that in nine
cases out of ten the keynote of the
after married life is sounded during
the honeymoon.— Boston Traveler.

Old Leather BottJoo.
Leather bottles, or . blackjacks, were
common in Europe two centuries ago.
The bottles were j often made of one
skin doubled up and closely stitched
together, leaving an aperture for the
neck. . Tba thick piece between was in
serted for the slip. It was meant to be
slung at the back, a leather thong pass
ed through two loops placed on either
side of the neck, and it was sufficiently
flat at the base to stand when put
down. The stopper was made of wood,
horn or old leather. A good deal of
care was required in the preparation
of the leather, which had to be oiled
and worked with hammers to make it
supple and then washed with a lye so
that all the impurity was entirely re
moved, leaving the leather clean and
dry. No moisture or air had any effect
on it Blackjacks were, in fact flagons
made in various sizes. They were
sometimes pitched Inside.
The Moslem Girl.
When she is twelve or fourteen the
Moslem girl comes to know she is beau
tiful, though she does not marry at the
early age of the Hindoo girl. She
counts the saris and Cholls and sighs
for fringes of pearls and modern dia
mond earrings she sees the friends of
her mother wear. In her rose colored
veil and gold spots she is the prettiest
picture you ever saw. With gazelle
eyes and Asiatic grace she is full of ar
dor and naivete at the same time. She
runs like a fawn at the approach of ,-t
stranger, but when unobserved hef
laughter rings through the house, and
tbe instinctive coquetry of her smiles
shows that the purdah is a necessity.—
Everybody's Magazine.
Following In His Footstep*.
Visitors , to China are particularly
struck by the numbers of pairs of
boots hung In separate wooden cages
In the archway of the main west gate
of Hsuanhua, the valedictory gifts of
beneficent prefects. It Is an attrac
tive custom In China to Invite a de
parting magistrate whose rule has
been popular to leave a pair of old
boots for suspension In a prominent
place as a hint to his successor to fol
low in his footsteps. It is a consider
able honor to be asked to leave these
boots, and the ruled make the request
all the more eagerly because they be
lieve in the efficacy of the hint.
'What Wrinkles Signify.
Wrinkled foreheads In children be
token consumption, rickets or idiocy.
Vertical wrinkles of the brow come
early to men who do much brain work.
Arched and crossing 'wrinkles about
the lower middle of the forehead be
token physical or mental suffering.
Fine close meshed wrinkles which cov
er the face, sign of age and decrepi
tude, are caused by loss of contractile
nervous, force and are prevented by hot
bathing, friction and electricity.—At
lanta Constitution.
A Gloomy Wedding Gift.
Two septuagenarians have just cele
brated their golden wedding, and
among their many presents was one
from a tombstone manufacturer, whose
gift took the form of a tombstone with
the names of the couple engraved upon
It It will be at once erected upon a
spot which tbe recipients of the gift
have selected as their last resting
place. — Liverpool Post.

Thedford's Black - Draught
will cleanse the bowels of im-
purities and strengthen the kid-

colds, biliousness, chills and
fever and all manner of sick-
ness and contagion. Weak kid-
neys result in Bright 's disease
- which claims as many victims
as consumption. A 25-cent

Iteason Why Birds Hake Tolletl *
As bird fashions do not change, the
lady birds of today wear the same
kind of dresses their grandmothers
wore and are never troubled about
style. Two suits a year are quite
enough for most birds, but they need
to take great care of them. Each sep
arate feather must be cleaned and look
ed over and the useless ones pulled
out You have seen a canary preening
his feathers by lifting them and
smoothing them out with his bill, and
you have thought him vain to do this
so often. If you neglect to comb your
hair it will become tangled and look
untidy, but more serious things happen
to a bird who does not comb his feath
ers. These feathers are not packed
close together, you know, but lie loose,
and have places between them filled
with air. When a bird wants to get
warmer he lifts his feathers so that
these air spaces may be larger, but if
his feathers are tangled or wet and
dirty he could not raise them, and soon
he could not keep the heat in his little
body and would die, of course.
The Sturdy Hn of Japan.
The average Jap we see in Europe
gives no fair idea of the physique of
his people. He no more represents the
average man of his people than does
the boulevardier represent the French
peasant ■. '
The average Japanese man, while
not tall, gives one the impression of
being probably the hardiest man on
earth. He lives perpetually In the
open air and on the simplest food. His
home consists of paper screens, which
never shut the air wholly out and are
always open a great part of the day.
He is hardy because he has been in
ured to the most extreme discomfort'
since infancy. He does not know what
comfort Is. His home has practically
no furniture. Matting, bedding (no
bed) and a tray for food supply his
wants. In a land cold beyond belief
over a large part of the year he never
has a coal fire, but warms himself over
a box holding a few fragments of burn
ing charcoaL— London Mail.
Origin of City Flans.
All cities, with few exceptions, trace
the origin of their plan to the inclosed
camp, and many still show marked
features of primitive fortifications. In
all early scheme for defense the in
closed square was considered the best.
From the time when wagons were
merely parked on the plain to the time
when buildings were constructed with
blank walls to the enemy, and their
facades to the open square, this plan
has been universally adopted, and
many of the great squares or market
places of great cities still show unde
niable evidences of these precautions
for defense. In the old city of Brus
sels the square upon which faces its
wonderful city hall is approached by
streets so narrow that they mnst sure
ly have been constructed with the idea
of defense In mind.— Architects and
Builders' Magazine.
The Stickleback Legend.
The stickleback is one of the species
of fish that build nests. There Is a
legend that the stickleback builds a
nest because during the deluge it
pulled the tow out of the bilge hole of
the ark, and if it had not been for the
hedgehog, who plugged up the leak
with his own body, Noah and his sons
would have had an exciting time bal
ing out their boat. When Noah found
out who had done the deed he ordered
as a punishment that the culprit should
be compelled each year to build a nest,
while other fishes would have an easy
time of it.
The Drum Major.
The dignitary known as drum ma
jor was not generally recognized in the
English army till the close of the reign
of Charles I. Corporal punishment up
to the time of William 111. was execut
ed by the provost marshal and his dep
uties, but afterward the drummer was
Intrusted with the task. Among the
records of the Coldstream guards Is an
order that "the drum major be answer
able that no cat has more than nine
tails." In 1661 a drum major of the
parliamentary army received Is. 6d.
pay per diem.— All the Year Bound.
An Idol's Long Sleep.
In Pegu may be seen an English sen

idol. The Burmese believe the Idol is

of repose, and awakening him. His
slumbers have lasted 6,000 years.
