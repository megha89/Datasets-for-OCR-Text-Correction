The slag from iron-smelting fur
naces, formerly a waste -product,
servos now for a variety of uses, of
which a few are enumerated by Dr
Theodor Roller. A blast \of steam
converts the hot slag, into mineral
wool, 'a non-conductor of heat and
sound, * which is valuable for cover
ing steam-pipes, filling the walls of
fire-proof safes, and placing between
doable floors. Molded slag forms ex
cellent building stones, while crashed
slag is good for road gravel -or for
making into building bricks with
lime. Very durable and easily re
placed paving stones are made by
burning crashed slag and clay until
glazed. By an English process the
hot slag direct fiom the furnace is
economically formed into glass, and
makes transparent plates very suit
able for roofing and sky-lights. A
French patent covers a method of
obtaining sulphate -of alumina gel
atinous silcia and calcium chloride
by treating residual furnace slag with
hydrochloric acid, sulphuric, acid,
and chalk.
The automobile search-light adopt
ed for the /British Army is on a
vehicle designed for 22 to 25 miles an
boar, and having cannon wheels, with
bronze 'treads and heavy pneumatic
tires, traverses cultivated fields and
bad roads at 12 to 16 miles. The
steel chassis is 20 feet long, carrying
a 1-cylinder Brooke petroleum motor
of 45 horse-power, and a three foot
lens projects a 40,000 candle-power
beam of light 3 or 4 miles. With
four men, the apparatus supplies
light, traveling or at rest, for 10 or
12 hours without interruption.
Fish shown at Paris in 1900 had
been preserved in nitrogen for seven
years.' Oranges, pears, grapes, cherr
ies, etc., are now being packed in
paper boxes containing nitrogen, and
the exclusion of oxygen seems to
keep the fruity frpm_depay_for_aa
indefinite time.
Smoke or soot is rated by Dr. A.
Jaoobi as the chief cause of acute
inflammations of the lungs, which
Ascher of Stuttgart has shown are in
creasing in England, Germany and
America. The increase is chiefly
among infants and old people. In
dustrial districts had a mortality of
nurslings six times as great as argi
cultural communities, and districts
of dense smoke had a much largW
death-rate than other industrial
centers. The rate among coal miners
is 130 per cent above the average of
the male population. Animals inhal
ing smoke— like those in large cities
—have been found to contract pneu
monia and tuberculosis much more
frequently and quickly than those in
clear air, although there is a singular
belief that soot in the lungs prevents
tuberculosis. On that theory the
metal grinders of Sheffield, until 25
years ago, sought immunity by visit
ing places charged with coal-dust
after being in metal dust all day.
Few escaped "grinders' asthma,"
and that is really tuberculosis.
Probably no region of like extent
has so many caves and sinks as the
Karst, a desolate limestone plateau of
Austria-Hungary, between Carniola
and the Adriatic Sea, north of
irieste. Since a recent careful ex
ploration, E. Boegan has charted not
less than 317 of the caves and pits,
giving their exact positions, and
specifying dry caverns, underground
watercourses and other features of
the honeycombed rock. In the
country around the Karst are hun
dreds of other similar caverns.
The secret of the joss-stick, the
candle and incense of the Buddhist,
has been > partially revealed by L.
Decker and P. Hurrier, after long
residence in Asia. A. rod of squaied
bamboo, of the desired- length and
thickness, forms a core and on this is
rolled a - mixture of odoriferous
powders agglutinated by slightly heat
ed resin, one end being left bare for
a handle. The composition varies,
in Canton province consisting of
camphor, sandalwood aconite, clove
and ten other drugs, the camphor
giving a pleasant odor and free burn

Solid phosphine is a material con
taining phosphorus in a non-poisonous
form, and has been bruught forward
by Purgotti, an Italian, as a safe sub
stance for matches. It is a yellow
flocculent material, devoid of taste
and odor, containing twelve mole-
cules of phosphorus to four of hydro
gen. Gaseous pbosphine is an impur
ity of crude acetylene, and the new
form is obtained by electrically beat
ing calcium phosphate with carbon
and decomposing the resulting
calcium phosphide in an atmosphere
of carbon dioxide by dropping water
on it. Three modifications of phos
phine are produced, the solid re
maining behind with the calcium
hydroxide, and being separated by
hydrochloric add. The solid pbo3
pfaine has so little effect that dogs

a serious future problem"] for cities
that is foreseen by Dr. U. Henriet, of
Paris. His experiments have proven
that in a large city especially if in a
valley, the lower layers- of the atmos
phere are stirred by the winds, ' but
are not renewed as rapidly, as they
are devitalized. Oxygen is being
withdrawn more rapidly than replac
ed. The effects upon the inhabitants
are marked, though never assigned to
the true cause, and include .inferior
physical development, nervous dis
orders attributed to the strain of com
petition, weakened vision, . and even
psychological results —like violent
acts of a mob that are absent in
oxygen charged air. The need of the
city is a new, better : and -brighter

The Land of Old Age.
"There Is a certain exquisite flattery
In our grandchildren's company. Betty
loves everything I do. I seem to her
witty, accomplished and gifted. More
than this, she treats me as an equal,"
says "An Elderly Woman" in Harper's
Bazar. "She is ignorant of draughts;
she Is not afraid all the time that I am
going to tire myself out. In a word,
she doesn't know that when she comes
to see me she comes Into the Land of
Old Age. She doesn't know that It's
because I am old that I have all the
time there Is, while her mother has to
make time for her. For all Betty does
for me I try to repay her by indul
gences of all sorts— sometimes by for
bidden indulgences. For these I get
mildly scolded, but I keep right on.
I have yet to hear of a boy who grew
up a bad man because of the little In
dulgences his grandfather showered on
him, nor of one who grew up a dys
peptic because of the surreptitious
cookies his grandmother gave him. I
am sure I am no worse a woman be
cause my grandmother begged me off
from some well merited punishments.
So I spoil my grandchildren as much
as I can, which is as much as I am let"
Bathing.
Cleanliness Is next to godliness, and
It is likewise essential to health. There
Is no apology for filth, and filth breeds
disease. Germs do not like cleanliness,
and they almost exert themselves to
avoid It, so to keep clean Is essential.
Every child should receive either a
sponge or a tub bath each day. The
6kln contains small glands, which
should constantly carry off the poisona
which collect within us. When the
skin is dirty these glands do not act
and these poisons are retained and give
rise to ill health. Bathing keeps their
ducts open, stimulates their action and
thus aids in the process of elimination,
thereby improving the nutrition. It
Is evident, therefore, that the idea that
frequent bathing in the winter months
Is dangerous is wrong. — National Coc-

Letter from
England.
Friend Emerson: ■ -
C I suppose you would like to know
how we got along after leaving Liver
pool, .as the English system is so
different than at home. We notified
the luggage man at the depot to call
for ;*" our ,-■" baggage; which we . had
addressed to our next destination,,
they called gave a numbered receipt
and delivered it at the address ;, given
without auy farther ' bother on our
part for a shilling a. package. There
are no transfer companies as we know
therei but the R. R. UoV, will attend
to ifc just (he same, and make the
proflt. VWe bought ; our • tickets,, got
on the express,' which only made two
stops and ran 50 miles 1 an /hour. H' No'
one looked . at ,' our tickets after 'we
left,' although our train was • made of
vestibuled f corridor cars, . quite " t an
improvement over the old style, there
are no brakemen only a guard, who
don't bother with or about passengers,
just checks out the baggage as label
ed, and signals when to start again,
which he does when he thinks every
one got ' off or on that wanted to.
They don't call 'out station uamos,
you must keep your eyes open for the
signs as you enter the station. At
Rugby, where the foot ball game .of
that- name , originated, -we had to
transfer to another line, still no one
asked to look at our tickets, and did
riot nntil we tiied to pass oat of the
depot at Northampton, then a ticket
agent asked for our tickets which he
took and let us pass : out s There is
now ay of getting out of a depot with
out -passing a tioket ■ taker. -The
booking office where they sell the
tickets is named from the old stngo
coach custom when they booked your
name for passage and didn't give yon
a ticket, now they give you a ticket,
but don't book your name.
The farms along the road are, all
small with bodges for fencing, and on
account of the cold wet summer, the
crops are very late with \ the wheat
down in many places.
Northampton like all the towns in
England has narrow crooked streets,
bat this beats them all ;in the old
part of the city. We took an . elec
tric trolley and rode up town to find
a stopping place, we found a place at
the "Peacook Inn," its an old Inn of
the stage coach time with its old
and a Dim imii ivi — mocs —
to come and hold the horses, and any
description that you may read in
Dickens or any old English- writer
about an Inn will fit this; but is
flrstclass in cleanliness, food and
prices.
We soon started out to find if we
could some of Mrs W's relatives, in
this we succeeded and surprised a lot
of uncles, aunts, sisters and cousins,
nephews and neices -who had never
expected to see her again. After the
joyful meeting was over of course we
had to have tea. Nearly everyone has
tea here about 4p. m. Even some of
the factories stop work for twelve
minutes to let the employees hare
tea. So four meals a day is the rule
in most parts of England.
Northampton is an old and quiet
historic city now about 87,000 popula
tion, the most of whom work at shoe
making. , There are a large number of
shoe factories employing from '20 to
1000 hands, of boys, men and girls.
We visited two faotories, and saw the
whole operation of shoeraaking.from
start to finish, its quite an interest
ing sight, but what pleased us most
was tho fact that all the best, most
efficient and complicated machinery
was of American make. The sewing
machines were all ■ of the Singer
Manufacturing Qo., made in the
Uuited States; although the Singer
Co. has a factory in Scottland.
Beer making is the next largest in
dustry and there are a number of
breweries, but from the * taste of the
"Bitter Beer," which is monthly
sold, they can make barley and bops
go a long way, the Porter is better
than the Stcut, but the Ale or Small
Beer as it is named here, seems to be
made after any of the others, by lott
ing the water run through' the gram
vats as long as it comes out colored.
It will quench thirst like water, but
as a nutriment or nerve food its a
failure. No more "Old English Ale"
or me. All "public houses" as
saloons are called here, open at 6 a.
in., close at 11 p. m. except Sundays
when its from noon till 2:30 pi in.,
and from (3 p.m. till 10 p. m, and
they obey the law or lose their
license. They are not allowed to sell
to an intoxicated person, so we never
saw a drunk man.
The historical part of the city con
sists of tho fact that Parliment under
various Kings met here, also old
battlefields of the Danes and Nor
mans, tho Romans also had been here.
There are four ot the ancient churches
still here, one built iv the l'Jth
century, ami one by the Knight
Templars. There is also a new stone
church very fine, built by a brewer.
Evidently he tried to set himself
right in the eyes of his Lord for
watering the Ale ho sold. About a
mile outside of tho city is one of
three out of ten crosses erected to the
memory of Queen Eleanor, wife of
Edward I, and were placed where the
bearse rested on the way from Nott
inghamshire to Westminister. The
cross as it is called, (there is no
cross on it) is finely carved stone,
and it like the churches is somewhat
disfigurred by fools and religious
enthusiast of past centuries who did
not believe in ornamentation. Crooi
wall had a habit of using churches
for stables. His house here is still in
use. , - ' -,
As all the towns . and cities have
sight-seeing plans.-; ; We ; till in ; our
time taking ■ side trips from here, so
went to Market THarborbugh and
Lnbenham, also Leicester, which is a
very nice city. . On Sept. 9th we cele
brated with a trip to Woolverton, aud
took a five mile xide tn a trap as the
two-wheeled carts ■• are named in] a
small villiage named Shenley", ' where
we spend a. very pleasant ' day in the
country, . returning -inj the 'evening
through Stbney StrStford. 1 sup
posb you know where* all these places
are, if you don't, your maps
and cyclopedias. '"•'
We will , nowigive you a" rest. "Our
next' will be -on our trip to Oxford;

So with our; best wishes ;as • usual I

AUKUM.
Oct. B.— There was a little ripple of
excitement here the later part of last
week by Henry Seoley^. finding a
human skeleton down on the middle
fork of .the Cosumnes. >■ : Mr . Seeley
found the skull of a human partially
uncovered in the sand. He uncover
ed it sufficiently to ascertain to a
certainty that it was the skeleton of a
human being. His supposition was
at the beginning that it might be the
remains of Jim Bushaw, x who dis
appeared several years ago in that
vicinity, and. no trace 'was every had
of him afterwards. Mr Seeley phoned
for the coroner, and when he arrived
the skelton - was exhumed and found
to be that of an Indian. This con
clusion was arrived at from the fact
that shells and Indian' relics were
found buried with him. - • ,
\j. An Indian woman familiarly known
as Ida, died here, to be buried atjin
old Indian burying ground on Albert
Uhlinger's place this evening.
An old gray haired Indian passed
me to-day and 1 halted him by asking
where he was going. "O! me. go
puneral; Injun, woman she, die. "
Where Indian go when he die? Ome
no no; white man he say up, Injun
say down, pointing to the- ground.
Now, it is a veritable fact, that a
whito man doubts an Indian and an
Indian a white man. It needs, no
philosophical conclusion to know
which has the justification of con
clusion on his side, for the Indian
has been the dupe of tho white man
from the earliest settling of America
up to the present time. '■' The white
possessions, and offers him a theory
of religion to pay^the bill of the
onslaught he has brought Air "In
jun." it reminds me of an occurr
ance said to be true, that 1 read
many years ago concerning an 'In
dian and the governor of Virignia.
It was \in the early settling of
America. An did Indian . chief ap
proached the governor one day, and
told him that the great spirit had
come to him in a dream telling him
that he (the governor) had given him
a span of horses and a buggy that the
chief had seen him drive so often.
"Well, said the governor reflectively,
if you dreamed it you must have
them," and immediately turned the
horses and buggy over to* the Indian.
The Indian drove off prouder than
Cleopatra. He returned in a few
weeks and the governor's inspiration
at faculty began to evolve, and he
told the Indian that the great spirit
had come to him in a dream and lie
(the chief) had given him up a large
tract of valuable land. The chief ran
his fingers through his coarse black
hair reflectively, and said in a tenor
of doubt. "If you dreamed it you
may have it,- but I will never dream
with you again. Now it is a fact that
a white man can outdream an Indian
and never miss a note in the melody,
and he can go to his prayer book and
thank God for what ho dreamed. ' .'

Ottis E. Stevens, living at 528 Fair
Oaks Aye., Stockton, vCal., says: "1
had beeu troubled for two or three
years from kidney complaint and a
dull heavy pain across the small of
my back. My kidneys did not per
form thoir functions properly, the
secretions being unnatural and the
passages too iroquent, greatly dis
turbing my rest at night. 1 used
many remedies but did not succeed
in finding relief until I heard of
Doau's Kidney Pills and procured a
box. They gave mo such relief in a
short time that 1 continued their use
and received a cure. 1 was seventy
four years old at the time this cure
took place and 1 think this is even
more reason that 1 should consider
Doan's Kidney Pills a marvelous
remedy."

Our Lost Sense.
One of the greatest discoveries of'
physiology Is that we once , had six
senses. What the lost sense was no
one knows, and probably no one will
ever know, but that our forefathers
possessed Jlt there is no doubt, - for
the remains of that part of the brain
la which It resided are still to be seen
In any one of us. These remains
are simply a small and now perfectly
useless little mass of brain substance
called the pituitary body. It consists
of two tiny little oval lobes Joined
together and lying In a little cavity
of the skull, strangely named the sella
tureica and situated over and behind
the nose. It is quite possible that it
may have enabled our forefathers to
see in the dark before lamps and can
dles were invented, of it may have
placed them in communion with ghosts
and fairies, or it may have been an
organ that enabled them to go home
in a bee line when they lost their way
In the primeval forests. On the other
hand, it is possible that it was a bad
substitute for. vision or smell or hear
ing and died out when the Improved
sense organ developed.

The Tax Rate In Jackson
County clerk Huberty has complet
ed carrying out tbe taxe3 on the
assessment roll of township one, or
rather of the city of Jackson, show
ing tbe ..amount, "of taxes 'assessed
against each individual property
holder, in regard to the special
bridge. tax of 19% cents on the 5100,
ha informs us that ho has not includ
ed that levy in the city . assessment
roll. As the Ledger has beretofoie
contended the property holders with
in the incorporate;! limits of Jackson
will 'not'ibe liable' 1 for either, the
county -toad tax of 33 cents, nor the
bridge tax of 19J£ cents, -making 52>£
cents in all. ■. The state and county
rate, therefore, that will be collected
by the county tax collector frum tax
payers in this city will,.beJsl.47>£ on
each SIOO. Tho city ia.ta.is 70 cents,
', 'so that the total within ..the incorpor
ated limits, including city taxoa, will
be 52.17>£— 0r 17J4 cents more than
the rest of the county will . be -culled
upon to contribute. / This is getting
off fairly well. ' Of course, it is the
special bridge tax that comes to tho
rescue of the city property-owneis.
It is an exceptional year. Having to
rebuild so many - bridges, makes it
hard on the general taxpayers, leav
ing those within . the incorporated
city. untouched by the bridge disasteis
of last winter.:..: 1 ' . •■•
A Foolish Report.
A report has been circulated that
the 1. & X K. H. Co., were contem
plating tearing up the track and
abandoning the franchise, realizing
what they could out of the track iron
and other material ; that the road
does not pay, and is not likely to pay
under existing circumtsances. ' It is
hardly necessary to say that there is
not the shadow of trnth in the'state
ment about abandoning the road. It
is at least an income property now;
and the prospect ' is bright that the
business and receipts will materially
increase in time. It may not pay
interest on the present liabilities, bnt
there is -no reason to ' doubt that
under 'economical management, it
will pay something -over operating
the company, which is bound to come
aa the result of present flnaricial
difficulties, the road will undoubted
ly get on a firmer basis. There would
bo no sense- in- abandoment. That
would mean the total loss of all that
has been put into the venture. An
extension of the line to Jackson,
which could be effected at a compara
tively small cost, would unquestion
ably increase the revenue, and at the
fame time cut down the expense ac
count. Instead of tearing up any of
the track, it is far more likely that
more rails will be laid to carry
freight and passengers to " the main
business center of the county.
The trial of Tirey L. Ford, charged
with bribery in connection with
granting trolley street car franchise
of the United Railroads of San Fran
cisco immediately after th's fire, end
ed in a disagreement of the jury.
The jurors stood eight for acquittal,
four for guilty. Abe Ruef, it was
proved, paid large sums to the super
visors. Th.at he corrupted— if such
an expression is permissible in speak
ing of such a despicable set' of
officials as the boodling board of Ban
Francisco has been shown to be— the
supervisory is beyond dispute; but
that he obtained money from the
officials of the railroad to be used for
criminal purposes, was not shown.
There was no connection between
Ford and the bribed members.' The
prosecution failed to place Ruef on'
the stand, as the prosecuting attor
ney stated he would. The charge
was not proven, and eight 'men. so
viewed it, and voted for not guilty.
Aud now the jaundiced press4-the
Call especially is raising tho cry that
undue influences were brought, to
bear upon the majority of tbo jurors
to get them for acquittal. The - fact
is, the proseautiou of the graft cases
in San Fraucisoo is getting to be a
legal farce. To a fair minded, un
prejudiced man, there wa3 nothing
else to do, other than acquittal under
the testimony produced. How tho
prosecution could look for any other
rosult trip 3 one's understanding.
Hat that they did expect a verdict of
guilty is evident. Another trial is
promised right away, and again the
old cry is rais^l, "Wo'll get him next
time; or we'll keep on trjiijg until a
verdict is-> roached - one-way -or-^- the
other, if it I takes all summer." It
seems to us they would have perform
ed an infinitely greater eorvico to Ban
Francisco, and the causa of justice
if they had expended a tithe of tuoir
efforts in sending the supervisors—
an organized band of looters— as thsy
branded themselves— to tho penitonti
ary, instead of rewarding each with
au immunity contract, at the same
time allowing them to hold on to
their ill-gotten wealth.

The Grape Crop.
The vineyardists are now commenc
ing to gather their .harvest of wine
grapes.' The crop is not a heavy one,
but is about an average. The warm
weather of the past week has been
very beneficial in maturing the grapes
for wine-making." The price paid
local wineries for home raised grapes
is $20 per ton. Of course, this varies
slightly, some may command a trifle
more, others somewhat less, accord
ing to quality of product/ This,
however, is a very satisfactory price
from the view point of the vineyard
ists, and leaves a good profit for the
wine manufacturer. It is rarely that
the yield of wine grapes is less than a
ton per acre, and the quantity of
wine produced from a ton of grapes
runs from 100 ton to 150 - gallons.
The wine sells in the local market for
50 cents per gallon, tin wholesale
lots. There is money yet in grape
raising, and wine-making. Years ago
the wine men were compelled to send
the wine to the Atlantic coast, gett
ing only between 30 and 40 centa per
gallon. Now this export business is
done away with, as they can readily
dispose of all they can produce to
California buyers, and at much better
Change in Stage Line.
John Raggio, who is the contractor
for carrying the mail between Moke
lumne Hill and Jackson, and who
sublet this right to Mrs M. Folger,
with the right, it is claimed, to re
sume the same at any time/ has noti
fied her that he will take the line
back. The change is expected to go
into effect next month. Since the
mines at Angels have resumed opera
tions, tbe travel between Jackson and
Angels Camp has increased material
ly. The same stage that will run
between . Jackson and Mokelumne
Hill will also ply between this city
and Martell, as the combined length
of the line from Martells to the Hill
is about eight miles, and can easily
be made with the same horses Jand
driver. The proposed change is in
the direction of economy.
Log Wagon Goes Through Bridge.
Monday evening a heavily loaded
log wagon belonging to, and driven
by Joe DrendeU, broke through the
bridge on the road that turns off by
Bradshaw's place, about a mile from
Pine Grove on the main county road
to Volcano. Fortunately t he
hurt nor were any of his horses pulled
into the creek with the wagon. Tbe
wagon was' only slightly damaged,
but the bridge is a total wreck.
Drendell has threatened to sue the
county for the damages sustained,
even though it was a well known fact
that the bridge would not carry any
such a load as he put on it.

the debatevwith a great deal of credit
to themselves. The contestants were
Misses Ethel Walker, leader; Madge
Luttrell and 010 . Werley as against
Donald Fisher, leader; Dubel Jbisher
and Donald Bradshaw. . While all
the speakers acquitted themselves
very well, a great deal of credit
is due Miss Watrous, who has charge
of the school. The average attend
ance of the school is about thirty
five, a great part of which comes from
quite a distance from town.
Will Move to Larger Quarters.
The galvanized iron building whioh
George W. Brown is having erected
on the lot adjourning the present
general store of Win. Tarn, is intend
ed for enlarged quarters for Tarn's
merchandise business. The frame
work is up. It will be Jined with
boards on the inside and ceiling,
with galvanized iron on the outside
and roof. When finished W. Tarn
will move the whole of his stock
into the new store. It has a wider
frontage, although not quite so deep
as the present store, including the
saloon in the rear. It is probable,
however, that he will devote the new
premises to the merchandising busi
ness in which event it will be much
more commodious anict convenient
than the old quarters.

Teachers' Institute. •
County School Superintendent
Greenhalgh has issued a call for the
county teachers' institute to meet in
Sacramento on Tuesday, October 22,
continuing until the 25th inclusive.
At that time the teachers' association
of Northern California will hold its
session in Sacramento, and Amador
county, wisely we think, elected
to join that body in holding its in
stitute this year. The institute will
in fact be merged in the general body.
Nine counties will hold their in
stitutes in conjunction with the
association, namely: Amador, Butte,
Nevada, Yolo, Colusa, Glenn, Placer,
Sacramento and Tehama, while three
other counties— Yuba, Sutter and
Shasta will meet during the same
week and abjourn to the Sacramento
meeting. A reduction of one-third
fare on the return trip has been se
cured'from the railroad company,
making a two-third rate for the round
trip, and special arrangements will
be made for accommodations at tbe
hotels and private boarding' houses
in the oapital city. It is estimated
that over 1000 teaohers will be pre
sent.
Broke a Rib.
 Johnny Peek, the driver of the
baggage wagon plying between Jack
son and Martells, broke a rib early
in the week. He was using a jack in
prying up the wagon, and in some
way the jack flew up striking him in
the ribs. Upon consulting a doctor,
he 'was informed that a rib was
fractured, and that he would have to
quit work for a few days. Charley
Rugne is driving the baggage wagon
instead during his lay-off.
Schools all Supplied.
Every school in Amador county has
been supplied with a teacher. This
year there was experienced more diffi
culty than ever . before in getting
teachers. For a time, jit looked as
though one or two districts would be
left without a schoolmarm. But the
exertions of the school superin
tendent, in conjunction with the
trustees, finally succeeded in getting
all the schools going, and the out
look is bright for prosperous year
from an educational view point.
Lays Oft Men.
Superintendent Finchler of the
South Eureka mine, laid off thirty
men Tuesday morning, pending a
more complete development of the
property. It in the intention of the
company to • keep the mill running

Keystone are short of men, so that
those laid off are mostly all at work
again, or will be within a few days.

Saw Mill Closes Down.
The Tiger saw mill about twelve
miles above Volcano in charge of H;,
M. Cooper, and owned by the Stand
ard Electric Co., closed down Sun
day afternoon after a very successful
ran of four months, and .the fifty
odd men, who had been divided .be
tween two camps, where laid ;, off for
the season. During all this time not
a siugle man was hurt seriously, only
a few cuts and bruises, while only
three horses were killed during the
entire run. Two of these were acoi
dently killed the fore part of last
week by a loaded car getting away
and running them down. The team
belonged to Finley Goodman.
The usual order given to this mill
by the company is for 1,500,000 feet,
and when it is filled they are sup
posed to close down. The capacity of
the mill averages about 33,000 feet a
day, though it has gone as high as
41,000 feet.' Most of the lumber cut
this year is from spruce, with very
little yellow or sugar pine. It is all
used by the Standard Electric in
keeping their flumes in repair, and
for new ones. N. E. Denning, who
has the oontraot for hauling out ' all
the sawed' lumber expects to finish
sometime next week. ' ;
Arrested for Abduction.
John Keyes was arrested Monday in
Plymouth by constable Wheeler on a
warrant , issued by judge Blower,
charging him with "felony in abduct
ing one Abina Bagalo under the age
of sixteen years I from the home of her
father." Bail was fixed at $1000,
but it was not forthcoming so he was
brought to the oounty seat and is still
confined here pending his examina
tion.
This is not the first time Keyes has
been in trouble, having been confined
in the county jail foe twenty-five
days in 1904, and for thirty days in
1901 for disturbing the peace. His
brother was up at the same time for
the same offense.

bible, printed in the Welsh language.
It was her father's bible, and was

HOW DID HE UO IT.
Refused to Stay * .
Behind Barred Doors.
■ ; H. D. Emerson was taken in charge
by Sheriff Gregory, Saturday eve'niog,
and place in the padded room. of the
county hospital,' known as the insane
ward. He was found acting strange
ly. The city 'marshal went to bis
cabin near South Jackson, ou in
formation from neighbors, and f:und
that ho was . laboring under^ the' im
pression that hoodlums were annoy
ing him: that 'they were gathering
about bis dwelling for the purpose of
disturbing him. He was armed ' with
a gun. The matter was reported to
the sheriff, who went to investigate,
and found ' Emerson walking up
Broadway, carrying bis rine. He
took the gun away from him, and
then accompanied him to the hospital,
locking him in the ward . as above
stated. Emerson was evidently un
duly excited, acting queerly, as the
effect of taking dv overdose of some
powerful drug, which he was in the
habit of using when mining in the
big tunnel at Middle Bar, td over
come the eltect of the powder smoke.
He conversed rationally enough,'how
ever, on all subjects, except the
matter of the annoyance from - hood
lums. He is ingenious in mechanism
and machinery, as the authorities
soon discovered.' In a . very short
time after be was placed in captivity
it was reported to the sheriff that he
had effected his . escape. .He waa
ryinted up again, and taken from bis
cabin and restored to the same quart-,,
ers in the hospital. This time the
windows and every- avenue of escape
was cut off, and 'it was believed a
night's sleep would fully restore him
to normal condition. Bat the cap
tive did not want to sleep just then;
his mind was working on the escape*,
problem. Soon he was met between
nine and ten o'clock traveling home-,
ward. Some, hospital: patients who
were around saw him leaving the
grounds, and remarked, "There he
goes again." For the third, time he
was ferreted out, and returned to the
hospital, and extra precautions were
taken to guard against escape. Every
body retired for slumber, except the
man who waa laboring under the im
pression that he was being restrained
of his .liberty without sufficient
cause. He was busy devising ways
and means to get out. Next morning,
sure enough, "the -bird had flown."
This time the lock was gone. He
had managed to get the best of it in
some mysterious ' manner. He was
found around town, joking and tell
ing the fact of his escape. <The
officials - were nonplussed. They
wanted to know the modus operand!,
but this satisfaction he refused to
give, unless they pungled up one
hundred dollars for the tip. They
don't know yet bow he got. out.
They concluded that if he possessed
skill enough to thwart them three
times in succession in that many
hours, he might ' just . as well he
allowed at large, without any further
efforts to curtail bis liberty. It was
simply a temporary spell of halluci
nation, and he has been all right ever
since. . > ■ ..-; :■;■i|c£SJj For Infants and Children. |

That our American rorests abound in
* plants which possess the most valuable
medicinal virtues is abundantly attested
by scores of the most eminent medical
writers and teachers. Even the untu
tored Indians had discovered the useful
ness of many native plants before the
advent of the white race. This informa
tion, imparted freely to the whites, led
the latter to continue investigations until
to-day we have a rich assortment of most
valuable American medicinal roots.

Shu Wanted a Book.
A fashionably dressed young womar
came hurrying ' into a bookstore re
cently and approached a salesman with
the statement: "I want to get a book-
It's a red book— not very thick! No, 1
don't know the name of It or what it
is about, because I haven't read It. It
has a picture in the middle of the cover
—at least I think It is a picture— lt is
something round, done in gilt. It may
be the name. ■
. "I wish you would hurry and hunt up
the book, because I am taking a tram
to New York and I want It to read on
the trip. I saw some one reading it
on the train the other day and laugh
ing over it, and that's why I want it.
"Of course I am' not expected to
know what it is, but I should think any
one who knew books and was handling
them all the time ought to know!
"No, I don't think It was either of
those books — it was thicker than that
one and more on the cerise shade than
that one. ...
"Well, I can't wait any longer for
you to hunt it up."
As the young woman passed out of
the shop she turned to her companion
and remarked audibly: "Strange how
Stupid some of these clerks are! , Well,
I wasn't going to really get it anyway.

"There "is another feature of restau

me as out of the ordinary. While per

Where the Flowers Came From.
"There was a teacher, teaching In a
very poor neighborhood," said a New
York settlement worker, "who received
daily gifts of flowers from one of her
pupils, a ragged little boy. The flow
ers were of all sorts, sometimes costly
hothouse blooms, sometimes simple, old
fashioned garden flowers. As a rule
they were somewhat faded. One day
the boy brought the teacher a great
bouquet of mauve orchids. To be sure,
they were much wilted, but none the
less it could be seen that they had once
cost a great deal of money. The puz
zled teacher as she took them said:
" 'Jimmy, where do you get all these
flowers that you give me? You don't
steal them, I hope.'

Tho Unsociable Young Napoleon.
At dinner during the voyage to Cor
sica, to which my. father invited. the
passengers who included some officers
of his regiment and the two Corsicans,
he requested an officer, M." de Belloc,
to call a young man who was wearing
the uniform of the military school and
reading at the end of the boat. The
young man -refused." M.de Belloc
came back " irritated and said to my
father:'. "I should like to throw the
unsociable. little fellow Into : the sea.
He has an unpleasant face." Will you
grant me" permission, colonel?"
"No," said my father, laughing,
"and I am not of your opinion. His
face shows character, and I am sure
that he will be heard of some day."
The unsociable fellow was the f utura

this scene to me at least ten times,

An Expert Marksman.
. The terms " "sharpshooter," "expert
marksman," etc., which have distin
guished the classes of military riflemen
are often puzzling to those not familiar
with rifle practice. To become a
marksman one must make 98 out of
a possible 150 at 200, 300 and 500
yards. The sharpshooter must get
160 out Of 200 at 200, 300, 500 and 600
yards, besides doing well enough In
skirmish to bring his*" total to 225, or
two-thirds of the possible score. An
expert must do all this and also score
40 out of 50 at 300 yards and 35 out
of 50 at 1,000 yards. The latter dis
tance is more than half a mile and
the bullseye looks mighty small.—

The Old Clock.
[Original.]
Ihe clock and tower were very old,
though the tower was far older than
the clock, haying long been a ruin
when the clock was put in It. It was
supposed to have been built by the
Romans. Some said that the clock was
the oldest tower clock in the world.
It had not marked the .time for nearly
a century. A few were living who
had seen Its great iron hands' swing
around the circle of Its dial, but they
were very aged people.; Its works
were covered with rust," and there was
not a cogwheel that could be turned
without a wrench, i
One night suddenly every person In
the village started up in bed. One,
two, three/four! There was no bell to
give forth this cracked antiquated me
tallic sound except the old clock la the
tower. And lf.lt had returned to Its
life It must be Its dotage, for the
hour, was 12 midnight and all counted
four strokes. Had not some one got
up in the tower and struck the bell
with a '-hammer? Impossible. The
stairway— the last put. ln— had fallen
years ago. : Then, : too, every one had
heard the whirring of wheels-r-a whir
ring harsh with rust , Directly, after
the last stroke Peter Steiger, who
lived just beneath' the tower, T had
opened his shutter and looked out and
op to the belfry. . All was still, up
there and about the tower. If a foot
step had fallen on the stones beneath
he would have heard It. . ■ ;£}--
Some of the villagers got out of bed
and talked to each other from behind
their half ' opened ' doors; some lay
awake wondering; some went to sleep
again. - Only little children slept oh
Without having heard a sound. "Ah,
'the children," said old Caspar Stetner,
"the. lnnocent children! If they had
been awakened I should not think
there was evil In it but they are in
sensible to evil." Caspar was the phi
losopher of the village, and his words
struck deep Into the souls of those who
heard him. All looked for some ca
tastrophe.
There was one person and only, one
not a ' child who had not heard the
ghostly strokes. That was Gretchen,
the granddaughter of old Becker, the
miller. Gretchen was to be married in
a few days to Hans Huntsman, a
young fellow, about her own age, who
loved her, and she loved him dearly.
Gretchen 'laughed at the fears of the
villagers. When they told her what
old gtelner had said she replied that
she had not heard the strokes, and she
was not a child, therefore the philoso
pher's words were not true.
While the older people were whisper
ing together,, shaking their heads and
giving way to their dread, the younger
ones were preparing for the wedding.
No one had been married In the village
for a long. while, for there were few
people there, and the boys as they grew
np went out into the world/ leaving the
girls with no one 'to marry them. But
Gretchen's lover would not go without
her. He ■ loved her better than even
success in life. This was not remark
able, for every one loved her. She was
gentle and amiable and kind. Bnt not
till later did those who knew her real
ize that much as they prized her, they
had not known her true value.
AU the preparations were made, and.
the wedding was to be tomorrow. One
man who bad been a sailor predicted
that the sun would shine. By common
consent the older ones ceased to talk
about the mysterious strokes of the old
clock and, for the young couple's sake,
assumed a cheerful ah". Up to 10
o'clock the younger people were laugh
ing and singing, then were still. .
i There were people in the village who
lay awake till after midnight fancying,
dreading, that they would hear the old
clock strike again. Why they felt this
way at this time they did not know.
Scarcely any of the older ones but
wished the wedding over lest some
thing might happen to mar it But they
were disappointed hi hearing the clock.
It did not strike again. After midnight
one after another they fell asleep.
While they were dropping off a light
appeared in the house of the miller.
Presently he emerged hurriedly from
the door and called his next neighbor.
Then, one by one, the villagers began
to stir, passing from one bouse to an
other, and all looking anxiously at
Becker. Gretchen had been token sud
denly 111. . :.
The anxiety, the running of people
In and out of the bouse, Increased rap-
Idly. At 3 o'clock one came out and
said, "If she doesn't get relief very
soon she will die." At half past 8
another came and said, "She Is sink-
Lag." At 4 o'clock old Becker wrung
his bands and said, "She is dead!" -
The people stood In groups in the
street saying to one another, !'The old
clock predicted this calamity, even to
the hour and minute It would occur,"
Then came old Caspar Stelner, and one
of the' women said to him;
"You said the strokes of the clock
predicted no ' misfortune because the
Innocent children did not hear them.'
You were wrong, you see.". ' "5
•There has been no misfortune," said
the old philosopher, "at least to Gret
dieu. She alone except the children did
not hear the strokes. Had the clock
predicted an evil for her she would
have heard its strokes. They predict
ed her entry lutD paradise."
This quieted those who heard the
words, and they went to their beds
—all but the old grandfather and the
lover, win were not to be comforted.
The words of philosophy are not for
thoze who mourn; they are for those
who have passed the dark portal.

THE MAN WITH
A HEEL
ICopyright, 1907, by Mary McKeon.]
James Dodd had bean an employee
of "the house of Waif our & Co., the
Bond street diamond merchants, for
a; period of fourteen year 3 before he
was made assistant manager and given
charge of the unset stones. - :
For two years after : he had been
given charge of the gems James Dodd
was simply waiting. He meant to fill
his pockets with plunder" and skip. He
was methodical and cold blooded. He
would not make the mistake so many
others had. He would make none at
all. Step by step he prepared for the
coup. He must change his looks, his
gait and his voice. An actor taught
him the art of appearing to be ten
years older.- , Some one , else taught
him that by holding a. peach stone in
his mouth he could alter the tones of
his voice. ' A shoemaker made him a
shoe for a deformed foot, and for
more than 300 . nights he walked
the streets with It. It gave him a
limp and a lop shoulder. He tested
these things in the severest way. 'In
his disguise he went boldly into the
store as a stranger and made pur
chases of men who bad known him for
years and years.
, Three . months before the affair was
ripe James Dodd had his every plan
laid. ' He would not flee abroad, as
others had done and -been overhauled
almost at once. He purchased a book
stand not five blocks away. He pur
chased an old house to live in. He se
cured a housekeeper. /He had worn
his wig a hundred times. The shoe
for the deformed foot had a cavity in
the heel. The diamonds hidden away
there would always be at band. At
closing time one day the event came
off. : Uncu.t and unset diamonds to the
amount of f 20,000 were carried home
in his pocket. An hour later he had
taken possession of his new' quarters
under another name.
The ''diamond mystery" made a
great sensation. The house believed
In the honesty of its employee; the po
lice believed he had skipped. Three
or four days were, lost in discussion,
and then a reward was offered and the
sleuths let loose. They telegraphed to
every port In the empire. They gave
notice to all the steamers that had
Balled. They had every constable In
every village on the watch. If Dodd
had committed five cold blooded mur
ders the hunt couldn't have been fierc
er.-It dragged into days and weeks
and months. It was discussed over
and over in the press and In every
police station and barroom in the land.
' A young man who had lived a life
beyond reproach for fourteen , years
Walks out of the house where he i\as
been employed, and disappears from the
ken of men. He waa not even seen to
leave his boarding house that evening.
No one saw him on the street He
had not gone abroad by any sort of
craft. Be had not taken a train for
any point within the empire." While
he was directly in charge of the gems,
the manager or either one of the part
ners had access to them. The detec
tives figured it out that Dodd must
surely be the guilty party, but a large
element of the public shook their heads
doubtfully and made comments that
put. others In' embarrassing positions.
After six months the hunt was
abandoned. ! It was the general opin
ion that Dodd was dead by accident or
suicide. Meanwhile the bookstand
flourished. Its only attendant day by
day was Mr, Cqoper, Its owner. The
only one to penetrate the old house be
hind It was the aged housekeeper, and
she went to her own home o' nights.
The public had been buying books of
a certain man for years. One day he
dropped out of sight and a new man
stood behind the counter. There was
a moment of surprise at seeing him, a
question or two, perhaps,' -as to the
other, and then business went on as
usual. That's the way with the pub
lic. The old goes and the new comes.
There were no newer or better books.
There was no change In prices. There
was nothing to call for discussion.
Detectives loafed away a quarter of
an hour at the stand. Employees of
the house of Walfour & Co. turned up
there almost daily. All sorts of men
stopped there. For weeks Mr. Cooper
heard his case discussed, but it was
rarely that he had a word to say. Soon
after the bookstand changed hands a
little girl twelve years old began to
pass that way every day with her fa.
tiler's dinner. By and by she and Mr,
Cooper began to nod and smile to each
other. Sometimes she would stop and
chat for a minute, and sometimes he
handed her a penny. She told her fa
ther of these things, and he was
wroth, but after walking around to tho
stand one day and looking the man
over he decided that there was no
harm in him. :. ;■'.'
A year lacking a few days bad gone
by, and it was midwinter again, when
one day as the girl passed the stand
two dogs began fighting in her path,
Mr. Cooper hurried out to kick them
apart and make a safe passage for her,
but in doing so he slipped and fell and
rolled off the narrow walk in front of
a van and was run over. There were
two or three minutes of excitement'
and then ha was taken away to tho
hospital, and the doctors found him al
ready dead. Mr. Cooper was known
by .name, but of course his clothing
was overhauled. As the shoe for the
deformed foot was removed It was
Been that the heel was turned a little.
A minute's Investigation revealed the
fact that there was a cavity and in
that cavity the diamonds stolen from
the house la Bond street. The man
had planned and plotted and dodged
and waited, and yet It had all been .'U
vain. The veriest trifle had exposed
him and lost him his life at one and
the same moment M. QUAD.
