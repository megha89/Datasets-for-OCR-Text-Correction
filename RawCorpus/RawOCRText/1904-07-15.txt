The Amador Ledger.
THE ENDOWMENTS OF YOUTH
[Original.]
Allan Douglas and Austin Brownell
were devoted college chums. The in
timacy was inexplicable to others.
What Douglas, with his splendid phys
ical and Intellectual endowments, could
find to bind him to Brownell, a reticent,
cynical man, without an element of
popularity in him, no one could dis
cover. Douglas was the pet of the pet
ticoats .and invited .. everywhere.
Brownell was considered very dull by
the fair sex and seldom invited any
where. If he had been invited he
would not have accepted. However,
there was one surprise concerning
Brownell. Though he stood quite low
in his class, when he was graduated
one of his classmates, who was an
"honor" man, said that he wished he
had Brownell's mind.
The friends studied law and prac
ticed in partnership. They were still
young when the more showy endow
ments constitute prominence, and ev
ery one, at least in society, wondered
how Douglas could have taken up with
such an ordinary partner. Douglas
was courted by the social world, every
one striving to secure him for en
tertainments. He tried to drag Brow
nell out with him, but failed both on
account of the disinclination of socie
ty for Brownell and Brownell's dis
inclination for society.
Douglas married a belle. She was* a
member of the smart set and a very
smart member. There was nothing she
would have considered, more out of
place than attention in public from her
husband, and there was nothing she
considered more in place than to have
some prominent society man dancing
attendance upon her. Finally a cotillon
leader, Ernest Rackle, became so de
voted to her that the intimacy became
the town talk. As usual in such cases,
no one talked of it to the husband.
One night Brownell went Into a fash
ionable hotel restaurant where the
smart set were used to taking supper
after the opera. ' He had never been
there before and went for a purpose.
Presently a gay party sailed in like a
fleet of yachts under a spanking breeze,
among them Rackle and Mrs. Douglas.
They passed directly, by the table at
which Brownell sat and as Rackle
passed Brownell put out his foot, and
Rackle tripped. He didn't fall, but
came very near it. Turning, he glared
at the man who had tripped him, then
went on. Brownell toyed with a wine
glass and waited. Rackle as soon as
seated gave him a threatening and con
temptuous glance. Brownell took a bit
•of paper from his pocket, wrote some
thing on it, folded it and gave it to a
waiter to take to Rackle. Rackle
opened It, glanced at it and put it in
his vest pocket without any of the par
ty having noticed anything unusual.
At 1 o'clock the two men met in the
cafe.
"Well, sir,'.' said Rackle, "what* do
you want?"
"To fight you."
"For tripping me up?"
"No; ostensibly for scowling at me;
really for a matter which' it concerns
you and a certain lady to keep dark."
"Who are you?" asked Rackle, nerv
ously pulling his mustache.
"Allan Douglas' law partner."
"Indeed. I am surprised that you
wish to bring trouble on him."
"I don't I wish to save him from
trouble."
•'By a public altercation?"
"No; by a private fight to the death."
There was something so calm in
Brownell's tone and eye, yet so deter
mined, that Rackle paled.
"When and where?*
"Now, in an upper room of this ho
tel."
Rackle stood looking in different di
rections like a cornered rat seeking an
outlet
"What will obviate the necessity for
this meeting?"
"Your pledge never to communicate
with Mrs. Douglas again."
Rackle thought it over, still pulling
his mustache. Finally he said:
"To avoid bringing a lady's name
Into unpleasant notoriety I shall have
to submit I promise."
"Write it."
A paper was drawn and signed,
which Brownell put in his pocketbook,
and the two separated.
• In less than a week Douglas, came to
bis friend and announced that be must
dissolve the partnership. Mrs. Doug
las had taken an inconceivable dislike
to Brownell and had made the dissolu
tion a sine qua non. Brownell pressed
his friend's hand fervently and assent
ed. ■
Two years passed. Douglas' endow
ments had not gained him any promi
nence except in society, and, though he
did not know the cause, his wife's inti
macy with Rackle had detracted from
even this. Certain prominent Jiidges
said that Brownell possessed the finest
legal mind at the bar, and if he had
ambition he might be the foremost
lawyer In the city. This got spread
abroad, and there was n good deal of
curiosity with reference to Brownell.
One day Douglas told his old friend
that Mrs. Douglas had recovered from
her prejudice and wished him to come
to dinner. Brownell accepted. Then
Mrs. Douglas went and sat by her
guest and whispered in his ear:
'!You were Just in time to save me.
I was a fool. From this time las well
as Allan will be devoted to you."
Another ten years have passed. The
attentions of Rackle to Mrs. Douglas
are forgotten In society, and Mrs.
Douglas js a model wife and mother.
Among his friends Douglas is regarded
as prosy, but on Saturday nights he
gets a select few old fellows of vigor
ous minds at his house, the central fig
ure of whom is Judge Brownell, and
in this way the host retains his repu
tation for an intellectual man.

A CASE OF
CONSCIENCE
[Original.)
"Jim," said the keeper, "I wish you
to promise me that you'll never do
anything to make it necessary for me
to hurt you. I'd rather put a bullet
into myself than into you."
"I'll try, BUI, to be satisfied to do my
time, but sometimes I feel that if I
don't get out o' here I'll go crazy."
"Be patient; you've only got a year
and a half more, counting time off for
good behavior, and that'll soon pass."
, The convict turned away with a dis
satisfied exclamation; the keeper lock
ed him in his cell and returned to bis
office.
Just three months from that time
Jim Burt, after a visit from his wife,
who smuggled him . a steel saw, cut
two bars out of his' window, let him
self down by means of his bedclothes,
dodged the guard and got away. 'When
the escape was reported to the keeper
he heaved a sigh. and, arming himself,
started in pursuit.
"I must get Jim or kill him," he
said. "Everybody knows that he and
I were schoolmates, and everybody
will believe that I connived at bis es
cape."
There was more than this in Bill
Connolly's determination to capture or
shoot his old friend— a cast Iron con
science. He considered it his duty to
safely keep every prisoner, and If any
one of them escaped to get him, dead
or alive. He could make no exception,
and in the case of his former friend he
must make a greater effort He divid
ed the pursuing force into sections,
sending them In different^ directions,
keeping one route for himself, a route
he felt sure Jim Burt would take. Tom
Hathaway, who had been one of a trio
of friends when they were boys, Bill
Connolly and Jim Burt being the oth
ers,- lived in a retired spot between
two mountains, a convenient place to
hide, and Bill knew that Tom would
hide their old friend Bill.
One with a less sturdy conscience
would have looked elsewhere for the
fugitive except, in the place where he
felt sure he was to be found, but Con
nolly could no more He to himself than
to those by whom he was paid to do
his duty. He went alone to Hatha
way's, hoping that he might the better
prevail upon Jim to return with him
voluntarily.
It was a cold winter day when the
keeper approached Hathaway's place.
Connolly shivered' at the thought of
Burt's being obliged to lie in conceal
ment in the cold.
At Hathaway's he was told by Mrs
Hathajvay (Hathaway was not at
home) that Burt had not been there.
But he had, and she had given him hei
husband's overcoat.
Connolly knew of a cleft in the rocks
a short distance up the road and felt
sure he would find his man there. He
walked till he came to an opening in
the bushes through which a path led to
the little cove, then took the path and
advanced. When he came within. a few
hundred yards of the hiding place a
voice called:
"Halt!"
"Come out, Jim."
"Never alive, Billy."
"You know my duty."
"No, I don't, Billy. I suppose you do."
"I'm obliged to take you back with
jne. You know how it would grieve me
to take you back in a box."
"Yes, I do, Billy? and you know how
it would grieve me to shoot my old
friend. You see, .I've got a position
here behind .these rocks to do all the
damage, or rather you can't see, fop
I'm too well covered,"
"And you'll kill me while I'm doing
only my duty, a duty that I can't fail
to perform without dishonor."
"I don't exactly see, it in that light.
You have your old friend's word that
he is not guilty of the crime for which
he is punished. The master you serve,
the state, has made a mistake, What
you want to do is to make a big effort
to satisfy the public without really tryr
ing to do anything."
"That's not my way of doing a
thing I'm bound to do. I'm not to A*
dde on your guilt or innocence. A
Jury has done that If they hit your
case wrong, that's your misfortune."
"And if you are my Jailer trying to
take me and I kill you in self defense
that's your misfortune." ,
There was a long silence, at the end
of which Connolly said. In a tone he
might have used to a stranger:
"Prisoner, come out and surrender or
I'll open fire on you.'V
To which, after a short silence, Burt
replied:
♦'Keeper, I'll not take advantage of
a man who regards it bis duty to kill
me. If I must fight yon, I'll fight you
in the open."
He sprang over a rock and advanced,
Sring and receiving his antagonist's
fire as he advanced. He had emptied
three chambers of his revolver and
Connolly had emptied, five of his when
both fell some thirty feet apart and
lay without motion.
Late that night Hathaway returned
to his home and learned that both his
pld friends had been there. Burt had
told Mrs. Hathaway where he was go-
Ing and asked her to tell her husband
to come and consult upon some plan
for further action. Hathaway hurried
away. The moonlight lay on the white
enow as he left the road and struck
into the path that led to the rocks. He
•walked rapidly till he came to the
bodies of Burt and Connolly lying side
by side. He placed his hand first on
Blurt's then on Connolly's heart. Burt's
was still; Connolly's was beating fee
bly. The overcoat thnt Mrs. Hnthaway
bad loaned Burt had been thrown over
Connolly. Burt, knowing that he had
received hlB death wound, had crawled
to his friend and carefully covered
him.

THE ARAB- HORSE.
Hell Virtually a Pony, but a Re-
markably sturdy One.
' The ' Arab is virtually a pony, stand
ing 14.2 * hands, oftener under than
over. He is not fast, even at the gal
lop; indeed, he is slow. ° He is a very
poor trotter both as regards speed and
action, a bad hack, and cannot walk
without continually sticking his toe
in the ground. He Is totally unfitted
for harness and la uncomfortable to
ride, except at the gallop; this is his
natural gait, and in It his movement is
free, smooth, delightful and easy. As
regards his general makeup and an
atomical formation, he is perfect, and
his constitutional and physical sound
ness Is 'wonderful. He has great bone
subetqgice, vigor, resolution, strength,
staying powers, courage, boldness, so
briety,! the soundest legs and feet and
extraordinary lung power, which is
d«e"t»? the atmospheric conditions and
free life to which he has been used
from time immemorial; extraordinary
eyesight, good temper, mild manners,
tractabllity, instinct and sagacity, and
for his size is a wonderful weight car
rier. .'^%
It Is this constitution
and anatomical perfection, and this
magnificent courage, nerve and mettle
of the Arab which have made the thor
oughbred of today what he is, and not
bis speed, which has only existed in
songs.
The Arab attaches far greater im
portance to bottom, speed and sobriety
than he does to what might be called
"artistic beauty." Of such a horse he
■will say: "Let us not be in a hurry.
Let us see him work. He might be
only a cow,. with a lion's hide on his
back." When you consider what then*
idea of bottom is, It may be sufficient
to know that It means a horse should
be able to travel with a man on his
back, a change of clothing, food for
rider and horse, his gun, flag, etc.,
from sixty to ninety miles a day for
five or six days in succession, and aft
er a couple of days' rest be able to
repeat the task, and this under a swel
tering sun. Further, it is not uncom
mon for pure Arab horses to cover
from 125 to 150 miles in the twenty
four hours, and this without food or
water until bis Journey is finished, and
then the Arab, when be dismounts,
wants to see his horse shake himself
and neigh loud and shrill and, paw the
ground [ for his food.— lllustrated Sport

Kngrllah Axes at Hastings.
At the battle of Hastings the corps
d'elite of the English army were ac
coutered with sword and shield, and
in addition to this they had hung
"great hatchets on their necks, with
which they could strike doughty
blows." Whenever a special deed of
valor is credited to an Englishman in
that battle, with one exception, it is
due to the ax he .bears. And now
what were these axes that den It such
deadly destruction on the Norman
knight? As to this we are left lv no
doubt. Time after time does Wace
call them "great axes." ' The head
alone in one instance was a foot in
length. And the Bayeux tapestry out
of about twenty axes represents nil
except some three ns having long han
dles. Hnrdly ever do we find lv the
tapestry the short ax for one hand. —

An Englishwoman of decidedly snob

gaged . the late Corney Grain to give

She left instructions that 'the enter

with the servants. The butler, j who
knew better, apologized, but Corney
was a man not easily disconcerted,
wrote Jerome K. Jerome. J He dined
well . and after dinner rose and ad
dressed the assembled company.
"Well, now, my good friends," said
he, "if we have all finished and if you
are all agreeable I shall be pleased to
present to you my little show."
The servants cheered. The piano
was dispensed with, and Corney con
trived to amuse his audience very well
for half an hour without It
At 10 o'clock came down a message.
Would Mr. Oorney Grain kindly come
up into the drawing room? Corney
went The company in the drawing
room were waiting, seated.
"We are quite ready, Mr. Grain," re
marked the hostess.
"Ready for what?" demanded Cor
ney courteously.
"For your entertainment," answered
the hostess.
"But I've given it already," explained
Corney, "and my engagement was for
one performance only."
"Given it! Where? When?"
"An hour ago— downstairs."
"Put this is nonsense!" exclaimed
the hostess.
"It seemed to me somewhat extraor
dinary," Corney replied, "but it has al
ways been my privilege to dine with
the company I am asked to entertain.
I took it you had arranged a little

BUYING RUB,ES IN BURMA.
A Peculiar Method of Bargaining For

The peculiar business methods of ori

The purchaser, placed near a win
dow, has before him a large copper
plate. The sellers come to him one by
one, and each empties upon this plate
his little bag of rubies. • The purchaser
proceeds to arrange them for valuation
in a number of small heaps. The first
division is into three grades, accord
ing to size. Bach of these groups is
again divided into three piles, accord
ing to color, and each of these piles in
turn is again divided into three groups,
according to shape. The bright copper
plate has a curious use. The sunlight
reflected from It through the stones
brings out with true rubies a color ef
fect different from that with red spi
nels and tourmalines, which are thus
easily separated. •
The buyer and seller then go through
a very peculiar method of bargaining
by signs, or, rather, grips, in perfect si
lence. After agreeing upon the fair
ness of the classification they Join their
right hands, covered with a handker
chief or the flap of a garment, and by
grips I and pressures mutually under

make,. modify and accept proposals of
purchase and sale. The hands are then

JAPANESE PROVERBS.
They Are More Picturesque In Lan-
guage Than Onra.
"Roses have thorns" and "Walls have
ears" are as. common in the Japanese
speech as in our own. We say "More
haste, less . speed," but the Japanese
phrase Is "If in a hurry go round."
In this country we very often remark
that "accidents will happen in the best
regulated families." The Japs, on the
other hand, with an eye to the pictur
esque, vitalize It, so to speak, in their
"Even a monkey sometimes falls from
a tree." One of our useful English
sayings is "Those who play with edged
tools must expect to cut their fingers."
In expressing a similar thought the
Jap goes us one better so far as plc
turesqueness is concerned. He says,
"If you keep tigers you are likely to
have trouble." One of our standard
maxims is to the effect that "oil and
water won't mix." The Japs have not
Improved on this.' "You can't rivet a
nail In a custard" is their way of put
ting it. "The lotus springs from the
mud" is their poetical expression of
the common thought that "out of evil
good may come."
What could be more suggestive and
at the same time so poetic as their
"Scattering a fog with a fan?" • When
a Jap undertakes the impossible his
neighbors do not scoff at him or mock
him. They Bimply say that he Is
"building bridges to the clouds" or
that he Is "dipping up the ocean with
a shell." Fnllure in such a country
must be as delightful as success In our
more material land. "Thine own heart
makes the world" is worthy of Emer
son or Browning. — Rochester Post-Ex

A Korean diatom.
In some parts of Korea, and among
some Korean families, It Is the custom
for bridegrooms to dwell under the
roofs of their fathers-in-law until the
first son has been born and attained to
years of manhood. Should any Ko
rean, however, stay in the house of his
bride's peopl# for more than three

THE STOOPING HABIT.
It Is One of the Things That Hake
Hen Grow Old Quickly.
Dr. Madison J. Taylor, giving gener
al advice to the aged in the Popular
Science Monthly, says in effect that old
people do not stoop because they are
old, but they get old because they
stoop. >
The stiffening of the tissues, which is
the sign and accompaniment of age, la
warded off by exercise. Self indulgence
in eating and drinking and in lazy
ways is the sure road to senility. ."I
have often been surprised and grati
fied," writes the doctor, "to find that
regulated movements of the neck and
upper truncal muscles, employed for
the purpose of accomplishing some
thing else, resulted in a conspicuous
improvement in hearing, In vision. In
cerebration and, as a consequence, In
a betterment in 1 cerebral circulation,
also in sleep.
"Persons who habitually maintain an
erect position in standing or sitting are
stronger than those who slouch. A
person who stoops and allows the
shoulders to sag down and forward
and the ribs to fall back toward the
spine shortens the anteposterior diam
eter of the thorax anywhere from two
to five Inches: The lungs, heart, great
vessels and other important structures
In the thorax cannot live, move and
have their proper being under such cir
cumstances."
Wherefore the proper thing for per
sons who are not so young as oace
they were is to brace up, dress young
and feel young. Sitting "hunched np"
over a fire won't do.
Bight and Left Handed.
It is curious to notice the vagaries of
humanity in cases where no hard and
fast line has been already drawn. Al
though most right handed persons pnt
on their coats left arm first, a consid
erable percentage thrust in the right
first. Soldiers fire from the j right
shoulder, but sportsmen are found who
prefer the left In working with a
spade a proportion of right handed
men grasp the spade with the left
hand and push with the left foot and
right hand, v though when using an ax
the same individuals would grasp

The American Fanner the Best in the World.
The American fanner is the greatest man
in the world to-day because he is master of
the soil — he is gaining in intelligence quite
as rapidly as his products are increasing in
magnitude. Our recent combines of capital
in United States measured in money are
enormous, yet such figures sink into insig-
nificance when compared to the money,
brain and brawn invested in agricultural
industries. For instance, the farmers of
Minnesota and Dakota have received $300,-
ooo.OQO for their products in a single year.
The farmer knows what Nature will bring
forth for him from his experience in the
past. He knows if certain seeds are
planted and properly cared for that Nature
will take care of the rest. In the . same

FRIDAY.... JULY ]5, 1904
DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.
1 The Democratic National Conven
tion met in St. Louis on July 6th,
and after a stormy session lasting
four da 3's aud nights adjourned after
.having nominated Alton B. Parker
for President and t:i-U. S. Senator
Davis of Virginia for Vice Presi
dent.' Judge Parker is said to be a
scholarly gentleman and a jurist of
marked ability. Senator Davis ser
ved with distinction in the upper
.house of congress for several years,
and though 81 years of age he is
still active both physically and men
tally and promises to enter into a
vigorous campaign for the success
■of the democratic ticket. Up to the
time of his nomination Judge Par
ker had not spoken a single word
that would indicate his position up
on any uf the questions that were
considered of vital importance. By
remaining silent he received the
nomination on the first ballot. But
in less than twenty-four hours there
after he assumed the role of dictator
and sent a telegram that threw the
convention into an uproar, the like
of which was neper before known in
apolitical gathering iv the United
States. The patch work that had
taken 1000 delegates through the
efforts of committees and sub-com
mittees an entire night to put to
gether was torn asunder by a single
man in a moment's time. Those
who looked upon him with distrust
now fear him all the more, while
those who had admired him for his
silence now find themselves trying
to explain away his first dictatorial
utterance. The platform as adopted
by the convention is, to quote Mr.
Bryan's sentiment, a meaningless
conglomeration of words, calculated
simply to catch votes, but it is so
utterly devoid of merit that it will
surely fail of its purpose. We cite
the labor clause as an illustration.
Do not fail to read and study that
clause, my fellow workingrcen, and
if you can find any comfort in so do
ing you are certainly easily comfort
ed. The only hope the democratic
masses now have is for Parker and
Davis to take matters into their own
bands and rewrite the whole thing.
It is a slender thread to be grap
pling for, but it is always better to
sink while trying to swim, than to
fold one's arms in despair and say
"good-bye, all efforts would be in
vain, I die."
UNITED STATES SENATORSHIP.
Bard and Oxnard are doing con
siderable talking just now down in
the southern part of the state as -to
which should be elected United
States senator from California. It
is the old story of one man tryiog to
hold on to a good job and another
trying to get him to let go. Bard
has plenty of money, so has Oxnard,
and if both remain in the fight we
may expect lively times next fall.
We remember that two men once
made a stubborn fight for the same
office. One was' named Grant, the
other. Burns, and after each had
spent a fortune along came the third
man and "Bard" them both out.
This is a big state and there will be
plenty of opportunity for, these men
to state specifically; the one why he
should be returned, the other why
he should be selected. Then if the
people are not satisfied with either
we understand that Geo. A. Knight
is willing to take the position at the
same salary, and there are but few
republicans in California who would
not feel proud to have . Geo. A".
Kuight in the senate. He is a man
of ability, an orator of national re
pute, and a man big enough to repre
sent the whole state, as a senator
should do. California to have in
fluence must send her brainy men
to the national congress. She has
lately been honored with a cabinet
position and a commissionership,
and if our best men are sent to
Washington we may soon be honored
with an important foreign mission.

State Fair.
Are short horns superior to Devons,
or Herefords or Polled Angus? Are
Jerseys better than Ayrshires or
Guernseys? Are Holstein-Friesians
better than any or all the rest? Each
breed has Its admirers, who claim that
It is superior to all the others. Some
can give an intelligent reason for their
faith, others cannot. : Most, If not all
of these breeds will be on exhibition at
the State Fair which opens on August
22d, and there will be an excellent op
portunity to compare and discuss their
respective claims to superiority. They
will stand side by side in' competition
for that purpose. /
But there will bo more than that.
There will be present a man of national
reputation as an expert judge of live
stock—Professor W. L. Carlyle, of the
Bureau of Animal Industry of Wiscon
sin, who has judged the stock for the
past two years, and who possesses the
faculty of making losers acquiesce
cheerfully in his decisions. He not
only judges the stock, but he compares
them point to point, explaining their
merits and deficiencies so clearly, and
in language so easily understood, that
the farmer can learn as readily as. the
breeder and can easily perceive which
breed will best suit his purpose for the
use for which he desires to raise it,
whether for beef, butter or cheese, or
for a family cow. Ho will also learn
how to pick out the individual of that
breed that is best suited to his needs.
Certainly such Information .alone will
well repay him for his time and ex
pense in attending the fair, but it Is
only one of many things he will see and
hear. Professor E. W. Major, now of
the State University, will assist Prof.
Carlyle in judging the livestock.

False Report.
. It was currently reported last week
that A. S. Hartwick, the fisherman ac
cused of selling' trout in Sutter Creek,
had plead guilty and paid a fine of $20.
This is a mistake. Hartwick has not
plead guilty, has paid no fine, and does
not propose to unless the court so de
crees. Justice Rose claims that if he
has no jurisdiction to try the case he
has no authority to fine the accused
$20, but can only conduct a preliminary
examination and hold him to appear
before the superior court or discharge
him for lack of evidence. Thus the
matter stands.

of the country than all other diseases
put together, and until the last few
years was supposed to be incurable.
For a great many years doctors pro
nounced it a local disease, and prescrib
ed locai remedies, and by constantly
failing to cure with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable. Science has
proven catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti
tutional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
Cure, manufactured by F. J. Cheney
& Co., Toledo, Ohio, is the only consti
tutional cure on the market. It is taken

to run. Both children were thrown
out. Raymond suffered most severely,
his injuries including cuts and bruises
about the head and face, one toe dis
located, and he was bruised from head
to foot. Clyde's hurts were bruises
and slight cuts. He was able to come
home the same day. Raymond' was
brought to Plymouth for treatment,
and by Friday was able to be removed
to his father's home, and it is hoped
that in a short time he will entirely
recover. The horse jumped into a
barbed wire fence, and when the wires
were cut to release it continued the
race across the field until it loosed
itself from the vehicle, Beyond some
scratches the horse was uninjured, and
the buckboard was not damaged be

Hearts
Are due to Indigestion. Ninety-nine ef every
one hundred people who have heart trouble
can remember when it was simple Indiges-
tion. It Is a scientific fact that all cases of
heart disease,- not j organic, are not only
traceable to, but are the dlreot result of indi-
gestion. All food taken into the stomach
which falls of perfect digestion ferments and
swells the stomach,- puffing it up against the
heart. This Interferes with the action of
the heart, and in the course of time that
delicate but vital organ becomes diseased.

Political Gossip.
. Bryan is. spoken, of as a has-been,
Hearst as a would-like-to-have-Jbeen,
Parker as it, and David B. Hill as a
will-be if Parker is elected.
Hearst says Parker" cannot carry
New York.
Bryan said Parker could not pos
sibly be elected.
"Applause for Parker 20 mrj^fof
Bryan 32 m.; for Hearst 38 m."—Ex
aminer. • You can always depend on
the small boy or paid rooter "Willie"
if you can't on delegates.
Hearst got 200 votes. Will any one
make an estimate of the cost per vote?
Delmas made a brilliant speech, but
the Examiner says Hearst got all the
applause.
Parker was silent before the" con
vention and received the nomination.
He has spoken once since and came
near losing it. He will now be muzzled
until af.tcr thr« election.
The Amador Dispatch succeeded in
defeating Hearst. It made a gallant
fight and won. »
Hearst pays Roosevelt a glowing
tribute for his settlement of the 'coal
strike. Hearst is now free to speak
the truth.
Let the Labor Union men road Hob
son's speech and see what democracy
has done for them. :t: t .
Turn Parker and Hobson loose with
out telling them what to say and Roose
velt need ask for no better campaigners.
The democrats at last have an issue
"explaining that .Parker telegram. "
Read the various explanations.
Bryan was taken with acute bron
chial affectations at the St. Louis con
vention. He will probably grow worse
until after Nov. i:: her.
Bourke Cochran left the St. Louis
convention feeling confident that defeat
stared them in the face. He has now
telegraphed to Parker sayiog "Me
too.'!
Since the nomination of Parker the
populists hope to elect Tom Watson
president.
The "Sliver Tragedy" is ended;
Parker has said so, Hearst is willing
and Bryan has acquiesced. Cleveland
says he will now vote the democratic
ticket.
Roosevelt and Fairbanks are talking
pleasantly at Oyster Bay . while every
democratic orator and newspaper of
note are apologizing for Parker's first
great blunder.
Farmers in the great valleys are
complaining - of the scarcity of help.
Was that the cry under democratic
rule? ;
The democrats now have Roosevelt
and Fairbanks . quarreling. Nothing
but another democratic telegram that
may require an apology later on.
Richmond P. Hobson misquoted
Booker T. Washington and the color
ed gentleman has called the hero down.
Chance now for an apologetic telegram,
Richmond.
Hearst has offered Parker the In
fluence of his great papers. With their
influence Hearst received 200 votes,
while'without their assistance Parker
received nearly 700 votes. If Parker
is a mathematician he will probably re
ject the offer.
Bryan, in a round about way says,
I, as a politician, must vote the ticket,
but you democratic farmers and labor
ing men had better stand by Teddy.
Our neighbor, the Dispatch, has been
getting in some new supplies and
machinery during the week.

Ocean, both papers one year for $2 50

Oiling and Sprinkling.
At a recent meeting of the board of
supervisors of Sacramento county a
lively discussion arose as to the legality
and methods of lotting contracts for
oiling and sprinkling the public roads.
Various criticisms were offered regard- ;
ing the method adopted by the board,
and it was finally submitted to the
district attorney for an opinion. - We
quote the following from the Union:
"Briefly, the district attorney held
that the supervisors have no right to
bunch road work, either oiling or water
sprinkling, and enter into contracts for
work in that form. In his opinion,
plans and specifications have to be
drawn for each several strip -of roads,
and bids advertised for, unless the par
ticular strip of road in question can be
oiled for a sum less than $300, in which
the supervisors of the district, by an
order of the board, may have the work
done without advertising.
The opinion of the district attorney
was sweeping, and under it the sprink
ling contracts recently awarded are
void." " ■ »
. The district attorney was asked to
submit his opinion in writing.

ical skill could not prolong her life.

she remained conscious she could not
speak, and greeted her parents, hus
band, children, brother and sisters,
only with a smile. She was a Christian
lady, beloved and esteemed by old and
young aliko. In youth she was an

ful and devoted wife, a fond and loving
mother. A large concourse of sorrow
ing relatives and friends followed her
remains to their last resing place in the

two sons she leaves her parents, one
brother, and four sisters to mourn her
loss.
Baseball.'
Sunday's game between the El Reys
of Jackson and the Mokelumne Hill
nine partook more of the nature of a
practice game than a real contest, as
the score 16 to' 13 will show. The best
playing was done by a 15-year-old boy
from the Hill, who made four. runs and
took in every fly ball that went In the
direction of left field. Dr. Gall also
made a hit., or got hit, as backstop.
The game sufficed to hold the large
and good-natured crowd until the time
for the principal attraction, the balloon
ascension. This was a decided success.
The aeronaut went up several hundred
feet and made a parachute descension,
landing about 400 yards from where he
started. The balloon remained up for
some time, and came down south of
Jackson. The affair was a success and
pleased all.
Resignation of Barrett.
Superintendent Barrett of the county
hospital has secured a more desirable
and better paying position with the
Fremont. M. & M. Co. than the one he
now holds and will tender his resigna
tion to the supervisors at their special
meeting on Monday. Mr. Barrett has
managed the hospital for four years,
and while he regrets somewhat to sever
his relations with county affairs, he
feels it his duty to go where he can do
the best for those dependent upon him.
Mr. and Mrs. Barrett have done their
work well. They carry with them the
good will of all the inmates, and their
many friends in Jackson wish thorn
well wherever their new employers may
see fit to send them.
Suicide of Henry Stark.
Henry Stark, an old and respected
citizen of this place, saw fit to end his
earthly existence Friday evening by
taking a dose of strychnine. As soon
as members of the family discovered
what he had done they sent for Dr.
Gall, who immediately called Dr.
Endicott and everything was done that
could bo done to preserve life but with
out avail. The victim went from one
convulsion into another until death re
lieved him of his sufferings. No cause
can be given for the rash act. He was
a man comfortably situated, and his
home surroundings were most pleasant.
His remains were interred in the Prot
estant cemetery Sunday at 2:30 p. m.
He leaves a wife, two sons, and two
daughters to mourn his loss.
A Painful Accident.
Elmer Sullivan, the 10-year-old son
of John Sullivan of Pine Grove, had
the misfortune to have his left hand
blown off Tuesday. The boy was try
ing to light a giant powder cap with a
match, when it exploded and shattered
his hand in such a manner that Dr.
Freiman found it necessary to amputate
the member •at the wrist joint. The
boy is doing nicely. This should be a
lesson to all boys who hear of the cir
cumstance not to meddle with such
things. They are intended for use
only by experienced miners. Young
boys should keep their hands off, or
they may soon have no hands to keep
off.
Fell Over 100 Feet.
One day last week a miner at the
Keystone, in Amador City, fell down

second day reported for work. There
is a great deal in knowing just how to
fall.

THE AMADOR LEDGER; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, JULY 15, 1904.
A TRIP TO THE
WORLD'S FAIR
California at the Big Exposition
St. Louis, July 6— Every Californian
must feel proud of his state because of
the magnificent display of California
products at the St. Louis fair. In the
agriculture and horticulture buildings
she leads by a wide margin all other
states. This is frankly conceded by
visitors generally. That which strikes
the stranger most forcibly is not merely
the size of the products shown, but
their variety. It amazes the average
farmer to see that one state not only
grows so many products, but also excels
in nearly all of them. Struck with the
size of peaches and other fruit, the re
mark is frequently heard, "Oh, ■ they
are magnified by the glass jars." They
are unmindful of the fact that if this
explanation is applicable to the Cali
fornia exhibits, it. will hold good with
respect to other states. So really it
explains uothing, ami the golden state
remains at the top of the list. "Cali
fornia will surely get the prize for the
best display," is beard on every hand.
Certainly those to whoso care was con
fided the getting up and arrangement
of this exhibit are entitled to great
credit. They have done their work
admirably. True, they had the ma
terial to work with. Still, even with
the best material the effect might be
lost with inartistic display. Our man
agers, however, have paid due regard
to this point; the arrangement being
as artistic and effective to correspond
with the superior character and divers
ity of the products.
Amador county, I regret to say, does
not figure in the display. I looked to
find her name mentioned in connection
with the exhibits in the three build
ings, namely, Agriculture, Horticul
ture, Forestry, Game and Fish, but in
vain. This is not the only, way in
which she has been ignored. Her
name, her territory even, does not
figure upon the maps and literature
placed in the buildings for free distri
bution. The promotion committee for
the development of the Sacramento
valley have folders and maps, and have
done good work for the section em
braced in the combine. Amador, not
withstanding that lone valley will com
pare in fertility and variety of products
with the best lands of the Sacramento
valley, has no part therein. The map
stops short, with our neighbor to the
north, El Dorado.
\ Passing on to the department of
Mines and Metallurgy, we looked for
an 'equally creditable display for the
state at large, and something to "show
that Amador was strictly in the pro
cession. We must confess, however,
to a feeling akin to disappointment.
California occupies a large space — fully
as large as any other state, and much
larger than the majority of sister states.
That the showing is large and varied
and fine cannot be denied, still to a
resident of a mining section it falls
short of expectation, and especially so
from the view point of Amador county.
Nevada county makes a splendid dis
play of gold specimens in two large
show cases. This is really the feature
of tho exhibit. There is an apparent
lack of care — a slovenliness we might
say — in the section as a whole that im
presses the beholder. The'tastiness
manifested in some of the other sec
tions—Colorado for instance— is want
ing. Samples of crude ore are not ar
ranged to the best advantage. Many
of the samples are not even labeled in
any way. Many labels have been torn
off, the marks where the labels were
affixed showing plainly. No effort has
been made to restore the labels. In
some instances the labels are hidden
away among the specimens so as to be
unreadable; in other cases they are
turned wrong side up, aud allowed to
remain so. Indeed, the air of indiffer
ence and neglect was too palpable to
pass unnoticed by the most cursory ob
server, at least at the time of our visit.
Most of the display was evidently taken
from the State Mining Bureau exhibits.
Amador county is not utterly ignored
in the mining display. We looked par
ticularly to this point. The number
and importance of our mines, and the
value of gold output entitled us to loom
up to advantage in a show-down of
mineral products. Besides which, if
we are not mistaken the county was
canvassed for weeks in the interests of
the State Mining Bureau, for the ex
press purpose of collecting samples of
ore for exhibition. There is nothing
here to show for this labor. After
carefully passing over the section twice
we noticed one specimen from the Con
tral Eureka, one from the Oneida, and
one from the Tellurium mine, Volcano.
This is the sum total of the gold ores.
Besides these, three samples of copper
ore from the Copper Hill mine on
Cosumnes river, presented by W. F.
Detert and erroneously credited to W.
F. Deterle were noticed. This com
prises the whole of Amador's contribu
tion to the mineral collection from
California. There may have been
other samples, but if so they are
among the unnamed, and therefore
might just as well have been kept at
home. As a county we made no effort
to bo represented, which practically
means that we did not want to be rep
resented. We secured the non recog
nition that wo bid for, and while the
outcome is galling to our local pride we
have no ground for complaint.
We have spent over two weeks here,
and have done little more than skip
hurriedly over the acres upon acres of
exhibits. Of foreign nations Japan
shows up wonderfully well, taking up
a large space in nearly every building,
and her display in every branch com
mands marked attention. On the
other hand, Russia has totally defaulted
so far. In one or two buildings a space
marked "Russia" is noticeable. It is
also noticeable that it is either devoid
of exhibits, or surrounded by a cloth
fence to indicate that it is not open to
the public.
We start for home via New Orleans
to-morrow, and hope to reach Jackson
in one week. R. W.

Shot His Friend.
Marico Marietta shot and perhaps
mortally wounded James Davetchi, as
he lay asleep in his room at the Roma
Hotel at the corner of 2nd and J street
in Sacramento. The crime is consider
ed one of the most cold blooded in the
history of the city. The men former
ly resided in Jackson and had long
been friends. Marietti is supposed to
have become jealous of Davetchi, be
cause he saw his wife in conversation
with Davetchi. Marietti tried to es
cape but is now in jail.

NOTES FROM
GOLD MINES
Kennedy.— The addition to the mill
is being completed as rapidly as pos
sible. When the 100 stamps are run
ning this will be one of the most
thoroughly equipped plants in the
state. • .
Oneida.— Every one is working and
saying little at this mine, which is a
good indication that the mine is in a
flourishing condition. Superintendent
Hampton keeps a watchful eye on
everything and is familiar with the
most minute details of every depart-
South Eureka.— Fifty men are
now employed at the mine. Good ore
is belngfmined, and the milt is again
running to its fullest capacity. The
future of this property promises to be
much brighter than its past.
Central, Eureka.— When a' prop
erty pays as this one has done, and is
doing, you can expect nothing but
praise for the mine from superintend
ent, stockholders, directors, and em
ployes. This is the sentiment that
prevails throughout at the Central.
Contentment and satisfaction are the
watch words and every thing moves
with the regularity of clock-work. , .
Lincoln— Wildman— Mahoney—
The Bpirlt of activity still pervades the
surrounding atmosphere, and those
in charge assure the anxious ones that
extensive operations - will j begin about
August Ist. The water is now being
taken out of the Lincoln shaft. The
whistle blows regularly.
Keystone,— The old reliable Key
stone never relaxes for a moment, the
mine is full of men both day and night
and the mill never fails to yield a good
ly portion of the yellow metal that
caused the democratic convention to
drop the silver plank from their plat
form.
Bunker Hill.— This, is one of the
busy spots In little Amador and . those
in charge have great faith in the future
developments of the mine.
Fremont-Gover— The mine has
now been closed three months. Every
Industry in j the county has suffered
thereby. $600,000 have been 'invested
by the present owners and the prop
erty is still a prospect. Work will un
doubtedly begin soon.
Argonaut.— The large ore bin is
piled high with good looking rock.
Developments are proving satisfactory
in the mine, and when the mill starts
again it will probably run continuously
for years.
Zeila.— Repair work is now in order
and the working force has been reduc
ed to 40 men. Many of the discharged
miners are spending their vacation in
San Francisco.
Installation of Officers.
Court Jackson No. 148, Foresters of

Kicked by a Horse.
On Wednesday evening Amelia Lepe
tich, the 6-year-old daughter of John
Lepetich of Jackson, while out at the
Drendel ranch was kicked by a horse
in the right temple and quite seriously
injured. She remained unconscious
for several hours, and at first little
hope was entertained of her recovery.
On Thursday she had fully regained
consciousness and was brought to her
home. The doctor now thinks the in
jury only temporary.

Died of Typhoid.
A Mr. Cauch, who was visiting
friends near the Defender mine, was
taken' with typhoid fever some time
ago, and- being a man of frail constitu
tion he was unable to bear up longer
under the heavy strain and passed
away Wednesday. On Thursday
friends made arrangements to have his
body shipped to his home in Washing
ton state. When the parties reached
Pine Grove the county health officer
had the corpse taken to Volcano, where
it could be properly prepared for ship
ment. Coroner Huberty took a
hermetically sealed casket to Volcano
and assisted undertaker Grillo in em
balming the body and sealing the cas
ket. The remains were shipped today
(Friday.)

Falls Sown Shaft.
Mokelumne Hill, July 10.— John
Souden, a shift inspector at the Gwin
mine, yesterday afternoon fell from the
skip to the bottom of the shaft, a dis
tance of 2000 feet, and was killed. His
body was mangled beyond recognition.
Souden and a fellow Inspector, Chris
Curovich, were going up the skip in
specting the shaft, a daily custom, pre
paratory to lowering the 3 o'clock shift
of miners. Within fifty feet of the top
Curovich, who was examining his side
of the shaft, heard his partner give a
warning signal, "Lookout." Turning
around he saw Souden's body being
drawn between the skip and the wall
plate. ; ;
The body 'was crushed through a
space of six inches and fell below be
fore a signal could be given to stop.
The supposition is that Souden, seeing
something was wrong, thrust his head
out to examine more closely and his
head was caught between the wall' and
the .skip. The miners below knew
nothing of the accident until they heard
the body plunge into the sump. Sev
eral hours passed before the head and
all the members were recovered.
Souden was 37 years old and leaves
a widow and child. He had been work
ing for the company eight years and
was a trusted and highly respected em
ploye.—Examiner.
Mr. Souden was well known along
the mother lode in Amador county.
He lived for many years in Amador
City, where he married the daughter
of Mr. and. Mrs. J. H. Thomas. His
remains were interred in the Amador
cemetery on Monday, under the auspices
of the Union, Workmen, and Foresters
of America. He leaves a wife, ; daugh
ter, and two stepsons to mourn his
death.— Ed.

Jackson, July 14, 1904.
We, your committee selected to pre
pare resolutions on the death of
Brother Henry Stark, respectfully sub
mit the following:. v;.j
Whereas, The Supreme Chief Ranger
whodoeth all things well, has again

Court Jackson No. 148, F. O. A., do
hereby extend to th» bereaved family
our earnest sympathy, and express our
deepest sorrow at their irreparable loss.

Bad Indeed.
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign.
Take Scott's ' Emulsion for it. For
weak digestion, for defective nourish
ment, for consumption, take Scott's
Emulsion. It restores flesh because it
strikes to the cause of the loss.
Bryan's Influence.
WmTJr-Br-yan.went into the demo
cratic national con ventioiTand- with a.
firm step and a clear conscience handed
back to the democratic party the com
mission it had placed in his hands eight
years before. He gracefully acknow
ledged his inability to win in the two
previous campaigns, but took particular
pains to remind the convention that ha
had received a greater number of the
popular votes than any democrat who
ever aspired to the presidency. ■ He
spoke in a manner that carried with it
the impression that no other democrat
could or would receive a greater num
ber of votes at the coming election. He
was sincere in every word he spoke, in
every gesture he made, In every im
pression that he wished to convey. ' It
must have been a thrilling moment
when this master democratic mind pre
dicted by action, if not by word the
fruitlessness of the effort that they
were about to make in the coming
fight. Many who were present on that
occasion will recall, after the first
throes of defeat, the scene as it pre
sented itself to them on that day, and
hail William Jennings Bryan as the
grandest man of the democratic party.
What other man- in the ranks could
have gone before the platform com
mittee single-handed and have adopted
by a large majority a plank that was
slated by the knowing ones to be killed?
What other man could have stood be
fore that committee : and fought the
gold plank to a standstill? . We answer
none. ' - Bryan himself was slated by
many to be litter ally, stripped of his
political influence, but by his superior
ability and persuasive - eloquence •he
won the respect and. . admiration ' of '
every person who gained . admission to
the great convention hall. He stands
out to-day in striking contrast to those
who sought to do him injury. He is
the greatest democrat of them all, and
the day Is not far distant when he : will
again be heralded as such. ' s.

Strike at the Jumper.
' On July 2 the management at the
Jumper Gold Syndicate's properties in
Tuolumne county posted notices that
commencing July 5 all underground
workmen would be required to strip to
the naked body before passing through
the change room in going off and on
shift; also that on and after that date
men working underground would be
notified by light signals when to leave
off work and when to resume at lunch
time, making tha.regulations in regard
to lunch time the same underground as
on top.
The first of these notices aroused a
strong feeling of resentment among the
150 employees of tfie company, result
ing In the calling of a special meeting
of Tuolumne Union, No. 73, W. F. of
M., on Sunday, July 3, 1904, when
action was taken, whereby, in case the
obnoxious order was not withdrawn,
after representations against it were
made to the management, the executive
committee was empowered to order a
strike. This action, was adopted late
Sunday night, and on July 4 the strike
was ordered. — Angels Record.

A GIANT OCTOPUS.
The Way a Thirty Foot Monster
Came to lie Captured.
. One of the most interesting objects
in the Natural History museum in
Trondhjem, Norway, is a large octo
pus. E. R. Kennedy, the author of
"Thirty Seasons In Scandinavia," not
only saw the octopus, but a lyprie later
heard the story of the capture of it, as
related both by the fisherman whose
boat it attacked and also by two in
dependent witnesses. The fisherman
was ' leisurely rowing on a calm day
close to the rock bound shore of one of
the fiords situated some fifty miles
north of Trondhjem. Suddenly a lous
and glistening arm swept over the
stern of the boat and remained there.
The fisherman, astonished at this un
wonted apparition, dropped his oars
and sprang to his feet. Like magle
another hideous looking arm shot over
the gunwale. The boat canted. The
man, realizing that he was attacked
by some monster against which his
old fish knife was the only available
weapon, seized his oars and labored
with might and main to get his boat
Into a crevice of the rocks, all the time
yelling for his mates, .who were not
far off. He had to strain every nerve
to drag his hideous cargo after him,
for the suckers never relaxed. When,
half exhausted, he got the bow of his
craft within reach of willing hands, it
took the three men to haul it up a
slight Incline, for the monster still
bung on, even over the bare rocks.
Then they belabored its head with
oars and clubs. Having safely secur
ed it, they 6ent off to the nearest sta
tion and telegraphed concerning their
prize. It was at once purchased by
the museum and carried there after it
had been photographed. They stretch
ed its arms out before preparing it.
The longest were each five alen. or ten
feet four inches, in length. Over all,
together with the great carpet bag
body; the monster measured thirty
feet across.
BATH BRIEFS.
Never bathe when overheated.
Never bathe when exhausted and
feeling ill.
Do not prolong the bath beyond a
reasonable time.
Walt more than two hours after a
meal before bathing.
In cold weather one should not go
out for some time after a hot bath.
Delicate people had better not bathe
until several hours after breakfast.
The temperature of water for a cold
bath should range from 32 to 65 de
grees. ,i.
If you are chilly and a cold bath
makes you shiver it is not the best sort
for you to take.
Dry the body quickly, using a dry
bath brush or a Turkish towel to stim
ulate circulation.
Opinions differ as to the relative
merits of a cold or a hot bath. Nei
ther kind will do for all. The individ
ual constitution must be consulted.
Unanimous.
The prisoner is led from his cell into
the presence of his seven wives, for
having which number he is about to
answer to the law.
"John," cries wife No. 1, "see where
your -folly has led you." ,
In a dazed manner he looked at the
array of women.
"How dared you?" demands No. 2.
"Wretch!" shout No. 3 and No. 4.
"Villalnl" exclaim No. 5 and No. 6.
Nervously he clutches the arm of his
guard.
"Have you no excuse, perfidious
man?" demands No. 7. [£?■.
Wiping his beaded brow with trem
bling fingers, he at length stammers:
"I— l— l must have been crazy."
"You certainly were!" agree the sev
en wives, each looking meaningly at
the other six.— Chicago Tribune.
MnKlcal Effects of tbe Sapphire.
To the sapphire has been ascribed
the following magical properties: That
it prevents wicked thoughts; that it is
such an enemy to poison that if put in
a glass with a spider or venomous rep
tile it will kill it. St Jerome in his
exposition of the nineteenth chapter of
Isaiah says thairthe sapphire procures
favor with princes, pacifies • enemies,
frees from enchantment and obtains
release from captivity. This gem was
sacred to Apollo and was worn when
inquiring of the oracle at his shrine.
It was esteemed as a remedy against
fevers. v
Sleepinar In a Cannon.
The Interior of a cannon is perhaps
tbe last place in the world one would
associate with a siesta, and yet India
possesses a gun which is capacious
enough to form a chamber where of
ficers retire for a siesta during tbe
heat of the day. This cannon, which
is beyond question the largest in the
world, is probably also one of the old
est. It was cast nearly 400 years ago
by a famous chief of Ahmednugger,
and came into English possession
when India was conquered.— London

Dr. Hale'a Secret.
A young man greatly impressed with
the great amount of work accredited to
Dr. Edward Everett Hale asked the
doctor one day how he did it. "Since
you are so much interested," said Dr.
Hale, "I will tell you, provided you
keep it a secret" "I promise," said
the inquirer, with an air of one about
to receive a remarkable revelation.
"Well, to tell you the truth," said the
doctor, with a wink, "I don't do it."

"She's exceedingly honorable," said

"Indeed?" queried the other.

THE jQIADQR JLEPGrEB: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY. JULY 15, 1904.
A PLUCKY LIEUTENANT.
He Was Insubordinate, but He Saved
His Vessel.
Reuben Finkbatn, a native of Nan
tucket, made his first trip as third lieu
tenant on the ship I'otomac, which
crossed the north raciflc, a region
little known to naval vessels in the
early thirties. Pinkham had been on
several whaling voyages, and was fa
miliar with those waters. The author
of "The Island of Nantucket" says
that one day, near sunset, he had the
watch, while the commodore was pac
ing up and down the deck. '
Suddenly Pinkham gave the order,
"Man the weather braces!"
"What's that for?" asked the com
modore. . ' ,
"We shall have wind in a moment"
The commodore went to the lee rail
and scanned the sea and sky. "I see
no signs of wind," he returned. "Let
the men leave the braces."
The crew dropped the ropes.
"Keep hold of the braces, every man
of you!" called out Pinkham, and the
men 'resumed their grasp. The com
modore flushed with anger and ex
claimed in peremptory tones:
"Let the men leave the braces!" and
again the braces were dropped.
"Don't any of you dare to drop the
ropes!" shouted Piukham, shaking his
trumpet at the crew, who once more
took hold. Just then the wind dropped
entirely; not a breath stirred.
"Taut, taut! Haul, all of you!" called
Pinkham, and the ponderous yards
swung to reversed position. The wind
came out of the opposite quarter and
struck the ship like a sledge hammer.
The vessel staggered, shook the spray
from her bows and dashed ahead. Tbe
commodore disappeared into his cabin
without saying a word.
. Presently he sent the first lieutenant
to relieve Pinkham, requesting to see
the latter immediately. When Pink
ham entered the cabin the commodore
said: -;:>".
"I consider that I am indebted to you
for all of our lives; but I will tell you
frankly if that wind hadn't come I
should have put you In irons in two
KOREAN CURIOSITIES.
The Koreans love medicine. The
rich take pills of incredible size and
richly gilded:
There are no bankruptcy courts in
Korea. Once a Korean contracts a
debt he can never escape from it
Korea is the only country where the
marriage certificate is equally divided,
one half being given to the husband,
the other to the wife.
Every Korean husband is answera
ble for the conduct of his wife. Should
she break any of the ordinary laws he
must suffer in her stead.
The most important duty of every
housewife in Korea is to keep alight a
perpetual fire, which Is eacred to the
dead ancestors of the household.
No- Korean may go upon the roof of
his house, not even to repair a leak,
without legal permission and without
giving due notice to all his neighbors.'
Paper enters largely into the con
struction of every Korean house. The
Interior is lined with paper. It has a
paper roof, paper, floor cloth and paper
walls.
The Number Ten.
In arithmetic everything goes by
tens. Sociologists trace the human lik
ing for that number to the "pentadigi
tate" or five fingered limb, which is a
characteristic feature of the entire
vertebrate family. A frog would
plump for the decimal system for just
the reasons that impel human beings.
Even a horse, which now has only one
finger and toe on each foot, has hints
in his anatomy which show that his
ancestors had the pentadigitate_ ar
rangement. Biologists are much Inter
ested to consider how the number
evolved was five. Why not four fin
gers or six or more? Somehow, more
than five would appear to be rather
more than one brain could give inde
pendent attention to, while five are
more useful than four.
Some Balls.
A correspondent at Birr, Ireland, de
scribes a lady being killed while hunt
ing and adds, "The deceased met with
a similar accident on a previous occa
sion." Another "had been in the
Transvaal between six and seven
times," and still another correspondent
declares, with a spirit which only does
him credit, that he has "never put bis
name to an anonymous letter." "This
evening's performance cannot take
place. It will be repeated tomorrow
night," is a provincial announcement
No Charge For Overvaluation.
"This ring," said the Jeweler, "will
cost you ?50, with our extra service
gratis."
"What is your 'extra service'?"
asked the young man who was looking
at engagement rings.
"When the young lady calls to make
inquiries we'll tell her it's worth $150."
Fortunate.
"Pretty lively bull movement," ob
served the friend of the man who
managed to get over the fence without
being gored.
"Tery," said the other. "I'm glad I
wasn't cornered."— Smart Set

He Was a Prophet.
In Cheshire, England, there are leg
ends of a prophet, one Robert Nixon,
who is supposed to ; have lived in the
days of King James I. : His fame
spread, and the king sent for him, ac
cording to the story. Nixon was great
ly distressed. He wept and mourned,
saying that If he went to London be
should be starved. When he arrived at
court the king, having hidden a ring,
asked him to find it. Nixon replied,
"He who hldeth can find." This great
ly struck the monarch, who ordered
him to be kept in the kitchen so that
there might be no fear of his being
starved. Nixon bad a great appetite
he could manage a leg of mutton at a
sitting— and he became such a nuisance
that one day the cooks locked him in a
closet. Here he was forgotten," and
his prophecy came true— he was starved
to death. The closet is shown in Hamp
ton Court; but, unfortunately for the
veracity of the tale, that portion of the
building was not built till the reign of
King William 111.
To Save One's Bacon.
Some think that the phrase "to save
one's bacon" arose at the time of the
civil wars in . England, when house
wives in the country had to take ex
traordinary precautions to save bacon,
their principal provision, from ' the
greedy appetite of soldiers.
In a slang sense bacon stands for the
human. body, and "to save one's ba
con" is just to escape, so that when it
Is said that a man has saved his bacon
It refers to himself,' as do the cogiiate
expressions, "Spare my bacon" | and
"Sell one's bacon." Thus in Carlyle's
"Schiller" we read, "To the kaiser I
Bold my. bacon, and by him good
charge of the whole is taken." 1
Others have less probably connected
the phrase with the times when heresy
was expiated at the stake, and a man
was said to have "saved his bacon"
who had narrowly escaped being burn
ed alive.
The French have a very similar
phrase, "Sauver son lard."
Hoit Sparks Are Formed.
Sparks are formed by the expansion,
under the action of heat, of air con
tained in the minute cells of wood, coal
or other burning . substance and nlso
by the evolution of gas in the same
cells. When the elastic force of the
imprisoned gas or air is greater than
the tenacity of the material can hold
in check, then the small cells or cavi-i
ties burst, and the flying splinters rise
as sparks. A sharp crack commonly
accompanies the explosion and con
tinues as hundreds of these cells burst
in rapid succession. The quick flight
of these burning particles acts as a
fan to Increase the flame, and when
the substance burns so far that no
more flame is formed the remaining
carbon ash is kept in a state, of In
candescence by the draft of air. When
all the carbon has been consumed tbe
spark dies out, as is evident if we
watch a falling spark on a dark night.

OUR SENSITIVE EAES
THE PECULIAR MECHANISM OF THESE
WONDERFUL ORGANS.
How They Are Affected by the Shock
of the Discharge of Bis Gnm-TUe
Odd Way In Which Some Ea.ru Are
Played Upon by Various Sound*.
Whenever a big gun is fired at Fort
Hancock, the government's proving
grounds on Sandy Hook, the officers In
charge advise all spectators to stand
on their tiptoes, suck their fingers in
their ears and open their mouths. On
board ship, where conditions are such
that one cannot get far away from a
thirteen inch rifle, the more sensitive
among the officers and sailors place a
cork or chunk of rubber between their
teeth when there is about to be a dis
charge. ;. Men have been known to
bleed in the ear from the effects of the
concussion caused by a much smaller
gun than a thirteen inch bore. One
of the officers at Fort Hancock was
asked to explain the philosophy of ele
vating oneself on the toes, placing fin
gers in ears and opening the mouth, ;
"Standing on the toes is like stand
ing on a spring," he replied, "while
standing on the heel or full sole of
the foot is like standing on a solid. By
placing a spring, between your person
and a violent force the Impact is so
weakened that you are unlikely to suf
fer injury. In the firing of heavy ord
nance a severe shock may be received
from the ground.
"As for the fingers in the ears, that's
plain enough. It is simply closing the
auditory canal -to prevent the ingress
of the air which is set in intense vi
bration by the discharge. Many a
careless soldier has had his tympanic
membrane destroyed by neglecting to
close up his ears, either with his fin
gers or some foreign substance..
' /'lt is wise to open the mouth, for the
reason that to do so tends to equalize
the pressure caused by the detonation.
With the mouth closed the pressure is
on tbe external side of the tympanic
membrane, forcing it inward and split
ting it. When the mouth is open this
is offset by the same pressure from
within, by means of the eustachlan
tube.
"Many men in the artillery are mi
nus tympanic membranes, but that
wonderful design of nature is not ab
solutely necessary to bearing. When
it is torn the hearing is impaired, cer
tainly, but not destroyed, since the
surrounding air then acts directly upon
the membranes of the two orifices.
Nothing In anatomy is more beautiful
than the arrangement of the ear. I
have made a study of It since coming
here, as I had the misfortune to lose
one of my tympanic membranes.
"The inner membrane of the cochlea
is lined with elastic fibers, discovered
by Cortl and bearing his name. They
apparently form the terminations of
the filaments of the auditory nerve.
Helmholtz, the greatest authority on
acoustics the world has produced, de
clared that each one of these fibers Is
attuned to a special note, and as they
are above 3,000 in number there must
be over 400 for each octave. The in
terval from one to another is onc-sixty
slxth of a tone. They form a won
drous instrument for reproducing every
note that the ear can distinguish. The
cochlea may be called an seollan harp
of 8,000 strings that move In sympathy
to all the sounds of creation.
"Many ears are Incapable of hearing
very high sounds. Many persons are
deaf to the chirping of crickets, , and
some cannot hear the twittering of
sparrows. ' There was said to be a
boy In Texas whose ears were de
formed to a remarkable • degree, the
auricle of one being nearly as large
as the side of his head, while that of
the other was no bigger than your
thumb nail. By closing the small ear
he could hear the approach of a rain
storm a hundred miles off. By closing
the big one he could hear a fly walking
on the ceiling. Isn't that romantic
enough for you? It takes a vivid im
agination to believe the story, but
when you consider the miracles of the
ear and hearing you may believe al
most anything.
"I do not doubt that there are many
sounds so faint that our ears are deaf
to them, but they make sweet music
for others. You know what paracousis
is, I suppose. No? Well, you have it
when you caijnot hear faint sounds at
all when thinfs are still, but hear them
at once when they are accompanied by,
a great noise. I once read of a woman
(an authentic case) who made her serv
ant beat a drum whenever she want
ed to listen to anything, for then she
coufd hear very well. There was a
man who could not hear except when
the bells were ringing. It is an old
story that deaf persons hear well when
traveling on a railroad, or when rat
tling over a rough highway in a car
riage.
"There was a shoemaker's apprentice
who heard only when his master was
beating out a sole on his iron. Tbe
left ear generally hears better than the
right Some say this is owing to tbe
common habit of sleeping on tbe right
side. I have my doubts. There is a
record of a man whose two ears heard
different tones at the same time when
a single one was given.
"The ears of the lower animals are
Incomplete. Do fishes hear? Certain
ly, although the cavity of the tympa
num is entirely wanting, the round and
oval orifices being at the top of the
head. Look out! Get up on your toes
and open your mouth. The mortar on
the left is about to be discharged. The
wind Is with the shell, so you needn't
close your ear. There she goesl" — New
