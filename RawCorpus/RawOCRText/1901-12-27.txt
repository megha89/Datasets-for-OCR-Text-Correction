Silence You Can See.
There is no such thing as silence In
this world. It is an Impossibility. That
Is partly tbe reason why science has en
abled us to see it >-%\ ! fe
The explanation of the paradox Is
this: Silence, as we understand It. sim
ply means, that there are : sound* too
delicate or too loud for the ear to ivpis
ter.. In other words, when we cau't.
hear anything we calftbat conditlou
"silence." But wherever you are there
are sounds around you. Even In the
deepest mine^the air vibrates- anil
makes a sound. An instrument lias
been invented ■ that will catch these
sounds and permit of the vibrations tie
ing represented pictorlally on a screen,
and in that. way you may see.-siU'iirr
and properly understand what j it
means. I ■
; By comparing the pictures of noises
with those of that condition of thins?
known as silence we gain an Idea of the
difference, between . a noisy uigiit. for
Instance, and one when "absolute si
lence reigns," as the novelist puts it. It
Is rather surprising to find so much dis
turbance at the time wheu everyihiii;:
appears to be perfectly quiet-— Pear

Wood Too Hard to Barn.
There are certain kinds of- wood that
are too hard to burn, or refuse to Ignitp
for some otber reason, such as Iron
wood and the good brier root, but It Is
a curiosity to come across a piece of
common deal— the soft light wood of
.which so many boxes are made— that
cannot be set fire to. . -, ••
. Tbe piece of wood ln question was
common white deal from Sweden, but
was remarkable for its comparative
weight It bad formed part of a boat
belonging to a whaler and bad been
dragged below the surface of the wa
ter-to the depth of more than half a
mile by a harpooned whale. The
length of line and tbe short distance
from the point of descent after being
struck at which tbe whale rose to the
surface was a proof of tbe depth I to
which it had dragged the boat
Only part of the boat came np again
at the end of the line, and It was taken
on board when the whale had been
killed. That piece of wood was jso
hard that it! would not burn in a gas

pressed it— London Standard.
Birds' Songs.
A French writer, Henri Coupon, says
that, notwithstanding the fact of their
simplicity, the songs of birds cannot be
imitated with musical Instruments be
cause of the impossibility of reproduc
ing their peculiar timbre. The" notes of
birds, while corresponding -with' our
musical scale, also include vibrations
occupying intervals between, our
notes/ The duration of birds' Bongs Is
'usually very short two or three sec
onds for thrushes and chaffinches, four
or five seconds for blackbirds, but from
two to five minutes for the lark.
Barnum's
Monkeys
; .."All well— all happy— 3lols
of fun". That is the regular
report from the monkey <sage
of Barnum's Circus ever since
the keepers began dosing ithe
monkeys with Scott's Emul-
sion. Consumption was carry-
ing off two j thirds of | them
every year and the circus^iad
to 'buy new ones. * - :
One day a keeper accident-
ally broke a bottle of Scott's
Emulsion near the monkey
cage and tl\e monkeys eagerly
lapped it up from \ the floor.
This suggested the idea that it
might do them good. Since
then the monkeys have received
regular doses and the keepers
report very few deaths from
consumption. Of course it's
cheaper to buy Scott's Emul-
sion than new monkeys— and
that suits the circus men.

JACKSO^,AMADOE COUNTY. CAtIFOBMIA, FKII>AY. DECEMBER 2*. 1901.
THE FIRST AERONAUT
HIS INITIAL FLIGHT INTO SPACE WAS
AT PARIS IN 1783.
Pllatre dea Rosier* Wu the Pioneer
of the Long Llue at During Spirit*
; Who Perished In Their Attempts to
Navigate the Air.
The first attempts to make ascen
sions by means of balloons were made
in' Paris in the year 1783. Pilatre dcs
Hosiers was the first-and most illustri
ous of the'lonVlist of aeronauts 'who
have fallen victims to their desire to
advance the artof aerostatics. ■'
In July and 'August of the yearl7B3
balloons filled with hydrogen gas were
sent up from Paris, and in September
at .Versailles the first balloon was gent
up freighted with living animals. ' -
In the same year. Montgolfler i con
structed a . balloon which be claimed
would be/ capable of carrying passen
gers, "his workshop being In the gardens
of the Faubourg St Antoine. The bal
loon was sixty feet in height and forty
eight ' broad.* Its exterior was richly
painted and embroidered, there being
represented upon it the twelve signs of
the zodiac, the arms of the king; of
France and numberless fleurs-de-lis and
lower down, amid a crowd of grotesque
heads and garlands of flowers, a flock
of eagles, with extended wings, that
seemed to be flying and supporting the
huge balloon upon their shoulders.
Below the balloon proper was con
structed a circular platform of wicker
work, covered with silk, which was
used as a car. This platform was very
large and was surrounded by a balus
trade to prevent the aeronauts j from
falling out In the center of this plat
form or car was an opening,; below
which was suspended by chains an Iron
stove, which was to be used for rarefy
ing the air ln the balloon, while ln one
corner was a magazine intended for the
storing. up of an immense quantity; of
straw, which served as fuel. . ■ • gj .
) Pilatre dcs Rosters,' generally alone,"
but at one time accompanied by "the
Marquis d'Arlandes and on another oc
casion by M. Girond de Villette, had as
cended in the balloon without cutting
the rope which , held it captive to a
height of 1.290 feet.
' Rosters had much difficulty in obtain
ing permission from the king to make
an ascent without being held down by
the. rope, bin consent was at last se
cured, and . on the 20th of Novembjer,
1783, everything was made ready. Dur
ing the day the wind and rain were vio
lent and i: was > found necessary jto
postpone thi- ascent The nest day,' the
21st, the weather was more favorable,
and at 1:30 in the afternoon In the pres
ence of the dauphin and his suit Pi
latre dcs Rosiei-s and the Marquis d'Ar
landes set out together from the Jar
dins de la Muette upon the first aerial
voyage ever attempted and performed.
The wind was still very rough and the
weather stormy, but in 'spite of these
disadvantages the balloon rose rapidly.
Having [Kissed over Paris and be
come free from all fear of getting en
tangled among the buildings of the city,
the aeronauts suffered themselves ito
descend considerably until they found
themselves in a fresh current of | air,
which bore them in a southerly direc
tion. ' r_
After proceeding a few miles farther
the fire 'was allowed to die out, and the
balloon descended about five inilesTrom
Paris. When the aeronauts returned to
the Chateau de la Muette, they were
greeted with the utmost enthusiasm by
the assembled crowds. Benjamin Frank
lin was a witness of the whole specta
cle, and when asked what he thought
af it be replied, "I have seen a child
born -which may one day be a man." i
Aerostatics had advanced to such a
ilegree that on ; the j 7th .of January,
1785, Blanchard, a rival of Rosters,
crossed over the channel from Dover
to Calais. '
Rosters was spurred on by Blanch
ard's success and set to work con
structing a balloon which, when com
pleted, he called an aeromontgolfier.
It consisted of an Immense balloon of
hydrogen gas, with a large cylinder
placed under it, the use of it being to
rarefy the air without losing gas.
! When a favorable day had arrived,
Pllatre for the last time made his
preparations. He was assisted by a
Boulogne pbysician named Romaln,
and on June 15, 1785, they stepped Into
the basket, the ropes were cast off. and
the balloon rose with the utmost maj
esty from the earth. .
When it had risen about 200 feet. It
struck a fresh current of air which
took it directly toward the sea. It soon
found another current which rapidly
carried it back again. It possibly may
have been the desire of the iu>rouauts
to descend to find a more favorable cur
rent of air, for while opening the valve
to let the cold air Into his cylinder un
fortunately a huge rent was made jin
the balloon: The consequences were
Immediate and horrible. At ttat time
the ba)loon was 1,700 feet above the
jurface of the earth. A few moments
ifterward the two aeronauts lay on
the ground dead and horribly muti
lated. • v .<;'-';? ;\ v :
Near the spot where Pilatre dcs Ro
siers was burled a monument : was
erected ln 1853 to commemorate the al
most miraculous crossing of the sea by
Blanchard, upon the very spot of earth
on which that Intrepid aeronaut de
scended. He had become for France
a hero, and numbers of inscriptions are
still readable.— New York Times. :
Spools and Thread.
The spool mills use about 82.000
Cords, or 16,000,000 feet, of birch'an
nnally, turning out 800,000.000- spools,
each spool large enough to carry 200
yards of thread. The amount of
thread that could be wound upon these
800,000,000 spools would reach 3,600
times around the world at the equator
and leave a little for mending.

NEW YORK CROWDS.
The Different Ways In Which They
Impressed Two Men.
"What I like about New York," re^
marked a westerner, "is its tremen
dous energy. . The crowds anil bustle
have upon me JJie exhilarating effect
of a stimulant. As I move along among
the masses on the sidewalks aud look
upon the perpetual stream of vehicles
of all descriptions in the streets I am
conscious of a buoyancy of spirit and
•n increased physical energy.
"I ! feel like going all the time, my
mind ' Is brighter and clearer, and, . in
fact, my whole being seems toned np. :
New York j and its crowds are more
beneficial to me than any resort I have
ever struck. After a two weeks' stay
here I return home feeling like another
man."
"Well, that is strange," said the per
son to whom this statement was made.
"Do you know New York has upon me
Just exactly the opposite effect. To me
what I might term the surplusage of
Hfe_ here is depressing. I am by no
means fond of solitude. I have lived in
a moderate sized city all my life, and
It bores me to stay In the country for
any great length of time, but when I
come to New York and am caught In
the tides of humanity, see the over
crowded tenements and have my ears
assaulted with the perpetual din of the
streets I become positively melancholy.
' "I feel what.'an Insignificant atom I
am, after all— no more than a drop of
water In a great river— and the feel-
Ing oppresses me. It seems so like
there was nobody here who cared what
became of anybody. The only relief I
find from the feeling in In the theaters.
I go to a show every night while I am
here, and of course I enjoy that Im
mensely. -But as soon as I have made
the rounds of the shows I am ready to
return : home. where 1 know most ev
erybody and there are many who care."

i More than 45,000,000 passengers a
year go through the North Union and
South Union stations In Boston.

modern long electric car is $2,000. the
average price of a set of double trucks
for such a car is $600, and the average
cost of the motor is $1,500. making the
total cost of the car $4,100.
Some of the Austrian railways have
followed the German custom of selling
numbered seats In tbe cars ofvfast
trains, both first and second class.' An
extra charge of^from about 25 to 50
cents is made for these seats, according
to distance.
The_pther day. Just as a train was
about to leave Kutas, In' Hungary, for
Palfalva, an official appeared and put
seals on the wheels of the engine. The
passengers had to get off and walk.
The company was 296 crowns In ar
rears in payment of taxes. Next day
the taxes were paid, and the train pro
ceeded. . .
Why His Clock Was Slow.
There is an Italian fruit dealer, with
a well stocked store near one of the
suburban railway stations, who bas
adopted a unique device, and one
which shows a deep knowledge of hu
man nature, to hold his own In com
petition with ' another dealer, whose
stand Is some fifty yards nearer the
station than his own. A . commuter*
was leisurely peeling a banana in his
store the ottier day when the Italian
remarked :
"You gotta fly* minute before your
train." • '•
"No; twenty," replied the commuter,
glancing at a big clock on the wall.
"Thata clock fifteen minute slow,"
said the Italian. "I keepa it slow.
Peepl' used come in a-here, looka at
clock, getta excite, go way, not buy.
Time to buy at Pedro's stand, aotta
here. Now keepa clock slow, get
inucha trade. No, I not letta peepl'

Health and Beauty.
A poor complexion is usually the re
sult of a torpid liver or irregular action
of the bowels. Unless nature's refuse
is carried off it will surely cause impure
blood. Pimples, boils and other erup
tions follow. Thin is nature's method
of throwing off the poisons which the
bowels failed to remove. De Witt's
Little Early Risers are world famous
for remedying this condition. They
stimulate the liver and promote regular
and healthy action of the bowels but
never cause griping, cramps or dis
tress. Safe pills. Kerr's Pharmacy,

Met His Hatch.
That well known historical person
age, Augustus the Strong, elector of
Saxony, has furnished the subject for
many a tale of bis wonderful muscular
power. We need refer only to' one
characteristic story in which, however,
be met bis match. On the occasion in
question be. entered a blacksmith's
shop. To show his suit bow strong be
was, picking up several horseshoes, he
broke one after the other, asking the
blacksmith whether he had no better.
When It came f&- paying the bill, the
Elector Augustus threw a six dollar
piece on the anvil. It was a very
thick coin. The blacksmith took it up,
broke It in half, saying, "Pardon me,
but I have given you a good horseshoe,
and I expect a good coin in return."
Another sjx dollar piece was given
him, but he broke that and five or six
others, when the humiliated elector put
an end to the performance by handing
the blacksmith a loulsd'or, pacifying
him by saying, "The dollars were prob
ably made of bad metal, but this gold
piece, I hope, is good."
Searching For a Soul.
Before the astonished eyes of a num
ber of Parisians a singular funeral cer
emony took place the otber day.
A resident property owner in the Rue
Malte-Brun had Just died. On the even
ing of his death, when darkness had
fallen, his relations, five or six in num
ber,* each provided with a lantern,
slowly made the circuit of the garden,
as If they were searching for something
In the walks. When they came to a
large heap of stones, they turned each
one of them over and then re-entered
the bouse.
This curious procession Is an old Nor
man custom. The dead person was a
native of the country near Glsors. Be
fore interring the dead it is necessary,
according to the tradition, to investi
gate and see that the soul of the de
ceased Is not concealed In a corner of
bis property or under some rubbish.

Loach Prices and Dinner Prices.
Any one who will take the trouble to
compare the lunch and dinner menu
cards of some of the leading restau
rants of New York will make a rather
surprising discovery. He will ascertain
that the prices on many dishes are cut
on the dinner card fi'orn 10 cents to 20
cents.
A gentleman whose curiosity was
aroused by this singular practice to the
extent that he went to the head waiter
for a mor<i satisfactory reason than the
table waiter could advance was given
tMs explanation:
"You see," said the waiter, "the gen
erality of men don't care for a heavy
lunch.- One dish and a glass of milk or
a cup of coffee, with bread and butter,
are sufficient for them; consequently to
prevent them from getting off too
cheap we have to put up the price of
single dishes. At dinner time it is dif
ferent. A man wants a number of dish
es for dinner, and so we can afford to
make our meats and fish cheaper."
"But do you think that Is exactly"—
"Honest? Why not? It is always
honest to take what people are willing
to pay you for what you have to sell. Is
it not?"— New York Times.

tirely In accordance with their religion—
that is, their working, eating, sleeping,
as well ns what we usually regard as
our "life" in the religious sense of the
word. Everything Is arranged for them,
and they follow the rules now Just as
they did 2,000 years ago. This constant
observance of the same rules for twen
ty centuries has molded tho brains of
the race Into one shape, ns it were, and
although their rites are queer enough,
yef there |s but an occasional example
of that striking deviation from the
common which is called Insanity in
countries inhabited by the white race.
They are fatalists too. With them It
is a case of "what Is to be will be"
carried •to the extreme. This has In
time given them the power to take all
things calmly and so freed them from
the anxiety that drives so many white
men into the lunatic asylums.
A Long; Sleep.
Dr. Soca, an English physician, re
ported the case of a young girl of sev
enteen taken with syncope after a cold
"tub" who slept fdr seven months In
the hospital to which she was admit
ted. When she was aroused from sleep,
she responded drowsily to questions
put and fell asleep again. At the end
of seven months she died of pneumo
nia, having slept herself out of life.
Sometimes she was fed ln her sleep
and at other times while they kept her
awake.
Dog: and Wolf.
There has been some dispute as to
fbe descent of the dog— whether It Is
an improved progeny of the wolf or a
distinct variety. That it Is a different
species is proved by the fact that the
dog and the wolf will mate and pro
duce offspring. Nevertheless It is prob
able that the dog is merely descended
from the same original stock with the
wolf.
Gnliot's Father.
Gulzot lived through the most event
ful periods of modern France. He was
born In 1787 amid the mutterings of the
revolution. Gnlzof s parents were mar
ried by a proscribed Protestant pastor,
and his birth was never legally regis
tered. His father, who was an advo
cate, used his talent for public speak
ing ln the interests of the persecuted
Protestants and became a marked man.
After living for several weeks In dan
ger of his life he was at last arrested,
unwillingly enough, by a gendarme -who
knew and respected him.
"Shall I let you escape?" said the
man.
"Are you married?" replied M. Gul
zot
"Yes. I have two children."
"And so have* I," replied the prisoner,
"but you would have to pay for me.
Let us go on."
They went on, and M. Gulzot died on
the scaffold a few days later. At this
time Francois, the future statesman,
who was the elder of the two children,
was six and a half years old and al
ways preserved the. recollection of go
ing to see his father In prison, or what
was euphemistically called the bouse of
justice.— Gentleman's Magazine. V , '■ .
Bine Predominant.
He was from the country and stood
helplessly ■ before the haughty young
lady clerk of the downtown store.
"What do you want, please?" she de
manded Icily.
He gulped down his embarrassment
for he was hopelessly young and shy
and awkward, and she was a most su
perior looking creature. .
"I want twelve yards of blue predom
inant," he finally said.
"What?" demanded the startled clerk.
"T-twelve yards of b-b-blue predom
inant," he stammered again.
"I'm sure 1 don't know what you
mean." said the clerk. Then,' womanly
kindness and intuition getting the bet
ter of her hauteur, she said, "Tell me
just what it was your mother or your
sister told you to bring."
He gave a sigh of relief and said:
"They wanted some wash goods for
my little sister's dress. They said they
were notjso particular as to quality and
color,- just so I got bine predominant
Can't I get it here?'— Memphis Scimi

Not In Order.
In a certain Lanarkshire village a
meeting was called to consider the ad
visability of erecting a bridge over a
creek which had been heretofore cross
ed by means of stepping stones.
The schoolmaster, who presided over
the meeting, warmly ; advocated the
erection of a bridge in an eloquent
speech, when a local worthy, who was
something of a character and noted for
his outspokenness, got up and Inter
rupted: "•
"Hoot, toot, schulemaister, you're fair
haiverin', mon! j Wha wad gang an'
put a brig ower siccan a wee bit creek
as yon? Losb, mon, I cud cross It wi'

"Order, order!" exclaimed the chair
man angrily. ' "You are clearly out of
order." Nc.
"I ken I'm oot o' order," rejoined the
interrupter amid the laughter of the
audience. ' "If I was In order, I cud
jump as faur again!" — London An

Very Tired.
It has remained for a little girl to
nearly, if not quite, equal a famous
witticism of Leigh Hunt Of course
she spoke in childish innocence, where
the English essayist and wit used his
ripened intellect
Hunt In describing an exceedingly
warm day, it will be remembered,
spoke of It as one which tempted him
to strip oft his flesh and sit in his
benes. ■'^• v "%-. '.
The little girl had been romping and
running all day. Toward nightfall her
father met her. "Are you not very
tired, little one?" he asked.
"Oh, not so very tired, papa," she re
plied. Then in a burst of confidence
she whispered. "Only I do feel as
though I'd like to take my legs off and
carry them awhile."

Loaded With Fat.
In the good old days when we were
greatly pestered by a neighbor's sow,
or mule, or bull, or dog, invading our
premises and taking unwarranted lib
erties we loaded the old shotgun with
powder and fat meat and, after serving
due notice upon said neighbor and said
notice being ignored, set out to uphold
the first law of nature, self defense.
The amount of execution that can be
done by a wad of fat meat on top of a
good charge of powder. Is 'amazing.
Wherever it strikes hair and hide dis
appear. It seldom if ever kills, -but
leaves scars that time does not obliter
ate. The fat being salty, causes excru
ciating pain, which lingers ' long In,
memory, and tbe stricken animal does
not offend again.

he would not care to go dueling again.

made a gallant : but Ineffectual stand
asainst the French who ' had invaded
Mexico for the purpose of erecting a
throne for Maximilian. Notwithstand
ing the fact that [the Mexican forces
were 'defeated, their defense . against
superior . numbers was so gallant that
the anniversary of the battle of the sth
of May became a national holiday in
Mexico.
A' brusque American once asked the
president, "Why do you Mexicans cele
brate "a defeat when you know that the
French finally took Puebla?"
President Diaz, with a twinkle to his
eye, replied, "Perhaps we have imitated
the Americans even to the extent of
celebrating our defeats, for I have been
told that the British defeated the col
onists at Bunker Hill, and yet you built
a monument to commemorate the
event" ■

FRIDAY DECEMBER 27, 1901
FOR A RAILROAD.
The imports into Placerville by
the railroad, for the year 1901, are
given at 7000 tons, and the exports
at 4750 tons, making a total of nearly
12,000 tons. This is an average of
over 30 tons per day. They are now
talking of extending the' line' to the
timber belt beyond Placerville.
Thirty tons per day is not a large
business for a railroad, it is true,
but it must be remembered that this
is freight handled at Placerville
alone, and does not include the busi
ness at any other depot. A rail
road from lone to Jackson, would
command, in a very short time,
many times that amount of traffic.
It is said that we have nothing to
ship out. That is a statement we
cannot accept. Because we are ex
porting comparatively little now, is
no foundation for the assertion that
we would have no export business
for a railroad. The truth is, we do
not know what resources a railroad
would develop. We have a fruit
growing country equal to the region
around Placerville; we have inex
haustible deposits of marble of ex-
cellent quality, all dormant because
of the expense, of getting the pro
*duct to market. We do not indorse
the opinion that a good wagon road
will dispense with the necessity of a
railroad. Wagon roads are all well
in their place, but they can never
stimulate business like a railroad.
There is nothing in the freighting
business at $3.50 and $4 per ton the
year round. A railroad could haul
freight between lone and Jackson at
$2 per ton and make money. That
• would be a high rate for 12 miles of
haulmg — 17 cents per ton per mile.
Still we believe the people of Ama
dor county would not object to pay
ing that rate for the advantages of
railroad communication with the
mineral belt. It would be an im
mense improvement upon the exist
ing order of things. -With ample
power right at our doors in the
Standard Electric Company's works,
it certainly should be a feasible busi
ness proposition to orgauize an elec
tric railroad to bridge the distance
between Jackson and the present
terminus at lone.
DEPARTMENT OF MINES.
Congressman S. D. Woods, of this
district, has introduced a bill to
establish the department of mines
and mining. The mining interests
of this country have become so vast
as to demand a special department
of the government for their proper
supervision. The bill, which has
been referred to the committee on
mines and mining, provides that a
cabinet officer, to be known as the
secretary of mines and mining, shall
be at the head of the department,
which officer shall be appointed by
the president, the same as other
cabinet officers, and shall receive a
salary of $8000 per year; an assist
ant secretary is provided for at a
salary of $4000, a chief clerk at
$1800 and such other clerks as may
be authorized by law. The geologi
cal survey office is to be transferred
to this proposed department, and
the business of gathering, compiling
and publishing information relating
to the mining industry is to be per
formed by this department. The
jurisdiction, supervision and control
of mines and mining lands now ex
ercised by the Interior Department
are to be transferred to department
of mines and mining. ' An effort was
made years ago to establish a de
partment devoted specially to the
mining interests. At that time it
was deemed inadvisable to do so.
Since then, however, the demand
has become so general and strong
that it is more than probable that it
will be acceded to.
GET REGISTERED:
All voters are required to re
register to entitle them to vote at
the next general election. Under
the present law, reregistration is
required for every general election.
Registration will commence after
the first of next month. Quite a
number of citizens have lost their
votes in this county of late years ■
owing to failure to register in time.
We hope this coming year this mat
ter will be attended to in ample time
by all republicans. The various
clubs in the county should reorganize
as soon as possible. It is in the di
rection of looking after registration
that the clubs can render valuable .
service to the party. We want to
poll every vote we are entitled to at
the next election, and this result
can be secured by the various clubs
paying special attention, not only to
seeing that republicans are register
ed, but also that they are registered
in their proper precincts.
ECONOMY IN MINING.
The San Francisco Chronicle of
the 23d contains the following in
regard to the two 1 great mines of
Amador county, the Kennedy and
Oneida:
Qn the mother lode a revolution
in the economics of mining has taken
place since the early seventies.
Then the cost of mining and milling
amounted to $9 per ton, and it was
considered scarcely worth while
handling ore containing less than
$12 per ton. In those years the
vein in the Oneida mine in Amador
county was being explored at a big
loss, because the ore was too low
grade to pay expenses. At that
time the mine workings were above
the 1000-foot level. Now the opera
tions are conducted between the
1200 and 2000 foot levels. The re
port for the year ending August
31st shows that the total operating
expenses affecting the mining and
milling of 69,511J tons of ore ex
tracted during the year averaged
$2,886 per ton. The ore yielded
$4,090 per ton, leaving $1,204 per
ton profit. An amount equal to
$0,745 was expended on construc
tion account, which raised the total
cost of operating the mine average
to $3,631 of every ton of ore extract
ed. In this mine crude petroleum
was recently introduced as.a substi
tute for wood as fuel for the opera
tion of the hoisting works, and a
saving of 35 per cent secured through
it. Besides, says the superintend
ent in his report, it is more cleanly
and easy to handle. Employing this
fuel, the total operating expenses in
August were reduced $0,603 per ton,
and the superintendent is confident
that hereafter these expenses can
be lowered to an. average of $2.26
per ton. >
In the Kennedy mine, adjoining
the Oneida on the same lode, a ver
tical shaft 2600 feet deep has been
sunk and the same equipped with a
rapid hoist for the purpose of re
ducing the cost of operation. In
this mine, one of the largest gold
bearing bodies in the State is being
worked. On the 2250-foot level it is
ninety feet in width — all good mill
ing ore. Working the mine through
two incline shafts following the dip
of the lode has cost an average of
$5 per ton for mining and milling.
These shafts have been very expen
sive to keep in working order. The
new vertical shaft is in the country
rock and may never need repairs.
It is confidently expected that the
total cost of gold-winning will be
brought to the same figure as in the
Oneida— s2.2s per ton. In this mine
there is now in sight 125,000 tons of
workable ore. If the ore body on
th.c 2250-foot level is of equal width
on the 2600-foot level, the volume of
ore in sight will be tremendously
increased.

The report of the Amador grand

reminds us of a certain "Down

speaking of one of the teachers this
censor of education remarked: "Miss
Smith done well in this school."
The Dispatch makes the foreman of
the grand jury say: "The first thing

We acknowledge the criticism.
Neither the Dispatch nor the Led

wording of the grand jury report.
An editor is expected to correct any
grammatical errors in ordinary com
munications, but he is hardly war
ranted in altering the wording of an
official document. This is supposed
to be published verbatim. The in
accuracies—for. there are several —
of the late report were noticed and
commented upon before. -the docu
ment appeared in print, and the re
mark was made that such reports
should be looked over with the view
of correcting any little shortcomings
in the matter of grammatical ex^
pressions, before being finally sub
mitted to the court. We are pleased
that our cotemporary has called at
tention to this point, as the local
papers did not care to mention the
subject. It will no doubt lead to a
literary supervision of such official
communications in future.

THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSOU, FRIDAY, PECEMBEB 27. 1901.
McKinley National Memorial.
Judge William R. Day, ox -secretary
of state and president of the McKinley
National Memorial Association, has
issued the following- statement to the
public adopted by the trustees at thoir
meeting in Washington, December 7th:
The McKinley National Memorial As
sociation was organized by the imme
diate'personal friends of President Mc-
Kinley to afford an opportunity for the
people of the United States to express
theii- personal love and devotion to the
late president by the erection of a fitting
memorial at his grave. The trustees
were appointed by the president of the
United States, the first meeting for or
ganization having been held at Cleve
land, October 10th. It is the distinct
purpose of the association to erect such
a memorial as will fittingly typify those
oxalted qualities of character, simplici
ty, dignity, devotion to duty, and high
ideals that were so f minently exempli
fied in his life and purposes. This
memorial is to rise above the grave at
Canton, Ohio, whero ho will finally
rest in accord with his own expressed
wish.
In bringing tho pnrpo^es of this asso
ciation before the people? the earlier
work has 'been nctvajarily one of organ
ization. This ha.s progressed rapidly
and satisfactorily. It is desired that an
organization be perfected in every state
and territory, and local organization in
cities, towns, and rural districts, with a
committee in chargo working in connec
tion with the state auxiliary is urged.
The public should be given the fullest
opportunity to subscribe.
The trustees desire to express their
deep sense of obligation to the press of
the country for its earnest support thus
far, and to recommend that all news
papers act as agents for the receipt of
subscriptions
By a resolution passed by the Ameri
can Bankers' Association, all banks
have been designated depositors for
subscriptions. All postmasters will re
ceive and forward moneys, and all ex
press companies will issue money orders
free of charge, and, when -necessary,
forward money free. •
In foreign countries the ambassadors,
ministers, and consuls of the United
States will receive and forward sub
scriptions.
In every case the name and address
of the subscriber should be forwarded
to the treasurer, Myron C. Herrick, ■
Cleveland, , Ohio, for preservation in
the permanent archives of the associa
tion, and in order that souvenir certi
ficates may be sent to each. . The
souvenir certificate adopted by the
trustees will be worthy of preserva
tion as a work of art and as evidence
of the holder's participation in the
erection of the national memorial. It
has engraved upon it a portrait of
President McKinley and, in shadow,
pictures of the president's home at
Canton, the Capitol, and White House.
-The public is especially cautioned
against any enterprise attempting to
make capital out of the sentiments of
affection which inspired the desire to
rear at the grave of our late president
a memorial which shall fittingly honor
his memory. It is the desire of the
trustees that all contributions shall be
the free-will offering of the people, and
they respectfully request the public to
discourage all propositions which may
seem to have as their object the ob
taining of money by giving all or part
of the proceeds to the memorial fund.
The public is hereby notified that the
McKinley National Memorial Associa
tion has no connection with or relation
to any other association or to any en
terprise of a cemmercial nature.
After a conference at this meeting
with the representatives of the William
McKinley Memorial Arch Association
of Washington, the following resolu
tion was adopted:
Resolved, That it be the sense of the
trustees of the' McKinley Memorial As
sociation that the field of popular sub
scription should bo left to it for raising
the sum necessary to provide a suitable
memorial to the late president at Can
ton, where his body lies; and that this
association should join with the Wil
liam McKinley Memorial Arch Associa
tion of Washington in memorializing
Congress to erect a national memorial
at the Capitol of our country to com
memorate his services to the nation.
The Arch Association acquiesced in
this resolution and has properly ceased
to solicit popular subscriptions, leaving
the field to the McKinley National
Memorial Association, through which
the people of the United States will
build a memorial of affection at the
last resting place of their beloved
president, William McKinley.

Kinley National Memorial Association

That McKinnon Deposit-
It seems that there must be some
mistake about the deposit in the
Hibernia savings-bank of San^Fran
cisco in favor of-M. C. McKinnon, and
which was advertised last week as a
deposit that had been left untouched
for 10 years. ..S. N. Spagnoli, who
has attended to his business for several
years; says that within the past month
he forwarded the pass-book of Mc-
Kinnon to the bank for posting the
semi-annual interest, at the same time
sonding $5 to be added to the deposit.
McKinnon is in his old haunts in the
mountains, and was no doubt surprised
to find his name among the list of un
claimed accounts. •
Saw Death Near.
"It often made my heart ache,"
writes L. C. Overstreet, of Elgin,

would collapso. Good doctors said she
was so far gone with Consumption that
no medicine or earthly help could save
her, but a friend recommended Dr.
King's New Discovery, and persistent
use of this excellent medicine saved
her life." It's absolutely guaranteed

having enjoyed excellent sport. The
"tules of Colusa are among the best
hunting grounds for game birds to be
found in the state. Arditto was invit
ed by a member of the gun club to a
days' shooting on the preserves of that
organization. He and another went
out a week ago last Sunday, and in a
few hours they bagged 82 ducks.
r^The rector of St. Augustine's, to-
with most of his choir, ushered
in Christmas morning singing carols at
some thirty homes throughout the
town. The singing was sweetly rend
ered, and was all the more effective
from being borne on still and frosty
morning air, and the sacred theme
which the melody commemorated. The
songsters were complimented on every
hand; many urged them to come in
and partake of coffee and chocolate
and other Christmas luxuries, but
time would not permit them to stay at
more than one house. The rector
wishes to keep alive the good and an
cient custom of Christmas carols.

THE AMADOU LEDGER: JACKSON, CALIFUKJNIA, FRLDAT, DECEMBER 27, 1901.
JACKSON MINING OUTLOOK
Sinking Continues at the
Argonaut.
Negotiations for the Purchase of the
Good Hope— Repairing the Shaft
at the Zeila.
Zeila.— Mining has been suspended
at the Zeila, on account of the necessity
of repairing the shaft. A large force
is working in the shaft, and it is be
lieved that it will be in working order
again by the first: of February. The
sulphurets works cominue in operation
as Usual, the quantity of sulphurets on
band being sufficient to keep the reduc
tion works going until the resumption
of work at the mill, unless something
unlooked for occurs to delay the work
in the shaft.- ,
Amador Queen. —lt is reported
that a chunk of ore was taken out of
the Amador Queen No. 2 last Saturday
that contained about $400 in gold. The
mine is being worked on a lease, and
work is directed exclusi vely to hunting
for rich pock V ets. ".' - ;. .
Argonaut — Sinking, operations are
being pushed steadily. Ten stamps of
the mill are kept running on half time
on ore from the Hoffman ground. The
point where the ore is being extracted
is about 2000 feet from the Argonaut
shaft, and work is much hampered by
distance and lack- of ventilation. We
understand, - however, that tho ore
body improves in size and quality, and
there is scarcely, any room to doubt
that a paying mine has been discovered
within tho limits of the Hoffman ranch.
The property is owned exclusively by
W. F. Detert. The Argonaut company
has the option to purchase. Should
that company fail to purchase it other
arrangements will no doubt, be made
for developing the property.
i J. H. Tibbits was in Jackson Satur
day. He paid off, in behalf of C. W.
Trotter of New York, claims due for
labor in doing the annual assessment
work on the group of mines owned by
the Trotter interest at Middle Bar.
The same parties own the Amador
Queen No. 1. Mr. Tibbitts informed
us that it is probable that work will be
resumed on this property next spring.
By a° decision of the court rendered last
spring the English company, known as
the Jackson Development Company,
was declared to own only the 60-stamp
mill, and was allowed five years time
in which to remove said mill. Upon
its removal the ground reverts to the
Now York owners, and all rights of the
English company are therefore con
cluded, as far as the Amador Queen
ground is concerned.
Good Hope.— Negotiations are in
progress for the sale of this property
to capitalists who are able to work it.
We are not in a position to state any
thing definite. The pood Hope com
pany has signified its willingness .to ac
cept $35,000 cash for the' property.
The offer is under discussion. It is
thought likely that the deal will be
consummated. It will be decided one
way or another within the next month.
The Good Hope is considered by min
ing experts to be one of the most
promising locations on the lode. It
lies partly within the townsite, and
the development of a paying mine
would Impart an impetus to the town
that has* j not been . experienced for
many years. The Anita company,
owning the claim adjoining the Good
Hope on the west, spent a large sum
in prospecting, under the impression
that the Kennedy fissure would be
found therein. After a thorough ex
ploration to the depth of 800 feet with
out discovering anything of sufficient
value to continue prospecting, work
was abandoned about four years ago.
The effort to purchase the Good Hope
creates the impression that the Anita
folks are now inclined to the belief that
the gold bearing vein lies to the east.
A number of the stockholders of the
Anita are also largely interested in the
Kennedy, and if the sale goes through,
active operations will soon, thereafter
be started, and prosecuted on a scale
that will set at rest the moot question
whether the main gold belt passes
within the Good Hope boundaries.
Christmas Entertainments.
St. Augustine's Sabbath school Christ
mas tree was held in Love's hall on
Tuesday evening. The hall was full of
people expecting their Christmas gifts.
The exercises were opened by a Christ
mas song by the school, followed by a
short address of welcome by tbe rector.
Those who took part in the program
that followed were, Glenn Hambric,
Leo Fuller, Beatrice White, Everett
Woodcock, Ethel Woodcock, Ellen
Hambric, Bertha Laswell, Nettie Tu
son, Lucy Heath, Edna Laswell, Lula
Roborts, Lola Knapp, Lillian Gregor,
Alma ' Francis, ' Evelyn Rust, Mamie
Hall, Frenie Matson. Those who took
part in the dialogue were, Len Rice,
Amiel Marcucci, Will Tuson, Bennie
Spagnoli, Ed. Delahide, Queen Oulds,
Dana Rice, Laura Tuson, Amy Tuson,
Emily Angove. The tree was loaded
with presents, and all went home much
pleased with the evening's enjoyment.
At the M. E. church on Christmas
night the exercises were unusually in
teresting, the church being crowded,
and many unable to gain admittance.
Tbe following program was presented:
Chorus, young ladies; recitation, Laura
Parker; duet, Anna Bartle and Rachel
Breese; recitation, Hazel Quirolo; song,
infant class; song, school; recitation,
Minnie Northey; solo, Clarence Dun
stan; recitation, John Love; solo,
Eloise Freeman; song, school. In the
distribution of the presents a novel fea
ture was introduced in the shape of a
Dutch windmill. This contrivance was
the ingenious work of A. H. Kuhl
mah. The Christmas gifts were doled
out through this mill with a noise re
sembling grinding operations. The
little ones were all remembered, and
their hearts gladdened by the receipt
of some token of affection.
J. F. Parks, superintendent of the
Kennedy, returned home on Tuesday
evening. He is getting along nicely.
His fractured arm is healing as rapidly
as could be expected. He is under the
care of Dr. Gall. '
There are unclaimed letters in tha

NEW SUITS.
Belle Leslie vs. H. F. Vogt et al—
Suit to recover the sum of $817 and
interest at 8 per cent. Complaint, al
leges that on the 6th day of September,
1900, defendant, Vogt, gave his
promissory note to plaintiff in the
above named sum, the note being due
one year after date. Said note is se
cured by mortgage of 140 acres in sec
tion 32,. township 6, range 12. Judg
ment is asked for $817 and interest,
also for $50 and 8 per cent of the judg
ment recovered for attorney fees, for
decree of foreclosure and sale of mort
gaged premises, and that a receiver be
forthwith appointed to take charge of
the property. . Henry H. Davis of San
Francisco, is attorney for plaintiff.
Charles W. Trotter vs. Amador
Gold Mine, Jackson Gold Fields, Jack
son Exploration and Development Co.,
and others — The complaint sets forth
that the various companies named in
the complaint as defendants were in
corporated under the laws of Great
Britain, . and were in fact the same
company under different names.' That
all are in process of liquidation. On
the 21st of June, 1901, defendants as
serted some claim or interest in certain
mining property as follows: 65 acres
described in a deed executed by Daniel
McKay and wife to William A. Wallace;
also mineral entry 800, known as the
Aetna mine, containing about 17 acres;
also the School House mine; also
rights of way secured by Amador Gold
Mine from W. Doyle, Margaret Holtz,
and Amador Queen Mining Co.; also
mill site and mining claim of Amador
Queen No. 1. That defendants agreed
to transfer to plaintiff all rights, title,
and interest in these properties, upon
the performance of certain conditions
by plaintiff. That plaintiff has per
formed said obligations, but defendants
hay to transfer their interests
to plaintiff according to agreement.
Wherefore plaintiff prays for judg
ment that defendants be enjoined from
asserting any right in said described
property, and that a receiver be ap
pointed to execute transfers of said real
estate to plaintiff, and that all the
rights of the Amador Gold Mine limited
be unaffected by said decree. Lindley
& Eikoff are attorneys for plaintiff.
The Streets.
Two teams are at work hauling rock
from the Argonaut dump to the road
between Hoffman's and the brewery.
This has always been a, bad' pieco of
road, and is now being treated to a
coating of metal which will make it
compare with any portion of the Ken
nedy grade. The rock from the Argo
naut shaft is the hardest kind of green
stone, and very suitable for road pur
poses. When this piece of road is fin
ished.other "portions of Jackson's
street are to be treated in like manner.
It is encouraging to see that some at
tention is at last being paid to tbe town
streets by the county authorities. Let
us hope that we have seen the end of
the practical application of the theory
that the streets of the towns are not
subject to supervisor control, but
must be looked after at the additional
expense of the" occupants and property
holders. Main street, Jackson, has ten
times the amount of traffic of any out
side road, and at the same time has re
ceived about one-tenth of the conside
ration in the way of expenditure of
county funds for its improvement.

Awaiting Examination for Insanity.
There are three patients awaiting
examination for insanity. Two of them
are confined in the insane wards at the
hospital, *and one in the basement of
the hall of records. One of them has
boon held for nearly three weeks, and
no sign of improvement. Another was
brought from Sutter Creek a few days
ago. His name is William Cassana.
It is thought that he may get well in a
short time. There is some doubt since
the new lunacy law has been declared
unconstitutional, as to the mode of pro
cedure to commit persons to the insane
asylum. The law now in force re
quires that the examination and testi
mony must be taken in open court and
in the presence of the person charged
with insanity. The general superin
tendent of state hospitals, F. H. Hatch,
has had prepared by the attorney gen
eral a set of forms to be used in com
mitting insane persons to the state hos
pitals. Samples of these forms have
been sent to our district attorney.
The blanks include affidavit of insanity,
order of arrest, order fixing time for
hearing, blanks for physicians', exami
nation, physicians' certificate of insan
ity, judgment of insanity, commitment
of insane persons, and the state of
financial ability of the patient. When
filled out, these are to be filed with the
superintendent of the asylum and coun
ty clerk.
A ' Collision.
As J. E. Batchelder, wife and child
were returning from Jackson Gate in a
buggy Christmas evening, they mot
with an experience they will not soon
forget. The vehicle was being driven
by a boy about 12 years old— a brother
in-law of Batcbelder. It was about 6
o'clock, and dark.. On ascending .the
grade at Newmanville, another team
was heard approaching from behind at
a rapid gait. The horse of % the Batch
elder party was old and slow, and rea
lizing the danger Batchelder seized the
lines, and endeavored to get out of the
way. The carriage from behind, how
ever, ran full tilt into them, swinging
the buggy half round, and finally
capsizing it. The occupants were all
thrown out. Batchelder escaped ' with
a few bruises about the leg. His wife
was badly shaken up, and at first it
was feared that she was seriously in
jured, but happily this proved incor
rect. No bones were broken, but the
soreness confined her to bed all next
day. The child, two years old, escaped
unhurt. ! It was asleep in its mother's
arms at the time of the accident, and
did not wake up until after it was all
over. The occupants of the carriage
that were driving so furiously in the
dark are unknown. They did not stop
to render assistance. ■ Batchelder's
buggy was damaged somewhat, . but
not as badly as might be supposed.

Middle Fork School Entertainment.
Miss "Isola, Middle Fork school
teacher, prescuted her pupils last Sat
urday to a large and appreciative audi
ence. The unexcelled decorations of
the building and the arrangement of
the stage scenery were superb, The
pupils, in their rendering ; of various
exercises, showed considerable ability,
and commanded delighted • attention.
The enjoyment of the children was
greatly enhanced by the timely arrival
of Santa Claus in the person of Nichola
Oneto with his cornucopia, from which
he scattered good things galore. The
dramatic club showed no mean order
of dramatic talent in their presentation
of a comedy, entitled; "A Matrimonial
Advertisement."* 'Tis an old maxim
that the sure way to reach a man is
through the medium of his stomach,
and this must have been known to the
good people of Middle Fork judging by
the supper served at recess, which was
a culinary triumph. ; The • entertain
ment concluded with an excellent ex
hibition of calisthenics by Albert Oneto,
to the music of the gigermi. The
teacher was ably assisted by Mrs. Mary
Cuneo, Mrs. "Mary Oneto, Mrs. Lena
Podesta, Misses : Stella Cuneo, Lena
Molfino, Theresa Oneto, Messrs. Victor
Molfino, . Dave, Nick and Lawrence
Oneto, John Cuneo, the school children,'

Christmas Trade.
The stores of Jackson have this year
displayed a more extensive assortment -
of holiday .goods than ever before.
The show windows have been decorat
ed in a : manner that would reflect ■
credit upon a much larger town. For V.
its size, Jackson undoubtedly ranks
among the largest trading | centers in
the state. - The Christmas trade this
year has been unusually good. All the
live stores report having done an ex
cellent business. The weather was all
that could be desired, and for several
days and nights preceding Christmas
day the stores were crowded with cus
tomers. | Several stores had to employ
additional wagons to deliver the goods
to their patrons. The Ledger is pleased
to chronicle this satisfactory condition
of affairs.

THE AMADOR T.EDGER; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FBIDAY. DECEMBER 27^ 1901
Don't Be AfraHl of Work.
One thing | that -keeps young men
down Is their fear of work. They aim
to find genteel so they
can dress, well, not soil their clothes
and handle things" with the tips of
their fingers. ■t ' They j do not like to
get their shoulders [ under the wheel,
and they* prefer.' to give orders to oth
ers or figure as rwsters and let some
one else do the drudgery. »; There Is no
tloubt that; indolence and laziness are
the chief obstacles to success.
When we' see a boy who has just se
cured a position take hold of every
thing with '-both- hands and "jump
right into his work" as if he meant to
succeed, .we- have confidence that ho
will .'prosper.-* But if he stands arouud
nnd ; asks questions when told ' to do
hnythlngrif he tells you that this or
that belongs to some other. boy to do,
foj it ls not his work; if he does not
try to carry out his "orders In the cor
rect 1 way;' if he wants a thousand ex
planations when asked to t run an er
rand and makes his employer think
that he could, have done the' whole
thing himself, one feels like discharging
such a boy on the spot, for. he Is con
vinced that he. was not cut out for suc
cess. That boy will bo cursed with
mediocrity or will be a failure. .There
Is no place in this century. for the lazy
man. He will be pushed to the wall.—
Success.
Shoulder Protection.
In the steel curb shoulder protection
which now forms a part of. the equip
ment of almost all cavalry the troops
have a permanent reminder of one of
the most exciting adventures which be
fell Sir [ George Luck, the lieutenant
general commanding the Bengal forces.
During the Afghan operations of 1878
to 18S0 he took. his regiment, the Fif
teenth hussars,' up to Kandahar and en
countered at Takht-I-Pul a strong body
of hlllmen led by Afghan sowars, who
made things pretty warm for him for a
few minutes. In the hand to band
fighting he became engaged with a gi
gantic Pathan, who broke down his
guard and would have cloven him from
shoulder to belt but that his wife had
sewed on bis shoulders In the lining of
his tunic a couple of steel curb chains,
one of which broke the force of the
slash.
The Incident so Impressed the mili
tary authorities in India that what Is
now known as the Luck or "lucky"
shoulder curb was soon afterward In
troduced.—Military Mail.
A Last Joke.
John D. Long, In the Massachusetts
campaign of 1878, was making his first
run for governor General Ben
Butler, who had ' captured the Demo
cratic nomination, and Judge Josiah (',.
Abbott, who was the candidate of the
old line Democrats. | r U r . 1 '- v- -
The late Judge Thompson was mak
ing a. speech for Abbott before a big
Democratic audience and, after pra is-.
Ing the candidate as a jurist and n
statesman, asked sarcastically, ,"And
now. who Is this John L-Lr-Long?". So
one answering, he proceeded: "They
say he has made a translation of Ho
mer's 'Iliad!' What g-g-good is that to
us? All Democrats read llomer in the
original." ,^ :^.:"' .
At this the person to whom the judge
was telling the story . laughed. . but tho
judge continued: "Tli-th-tlint's not tlie
nal joke nt all! The real joke is that
not a in-ui-uinn In the audience so much
as smiled!"
Where She Differed From Pnal.
A Scotch clergyman called upon a
parishioner not long since, "an old wom
an who was . not blessed with many
virtues, but who possessed a very va
ried assortment of vices. He took the
latter as a text for a sermon and spoke
to her at considerable length upon tho
subject, concluding with some extracts
from one of St Paul's epistles which
he felt to be apropos.
She didn't gpeak for several minutes
after be had finished, and he thought
that he bad made an impression upon
her at last He was mistaken, how
ever, for ; she . suddenly turned round
with' the remark: "Humph! That" s
Just where Paul and I have differed
these ten years."
The argument was not continued.
Man loves to be praised for his Intui
tion, woman for her logic. As a rule
neither possesses either.— Smart Set

His One Dally Heal.
Dr. George Fordyce, the . celebrated
anatomist : and lecturer, on chemistry,
used to eat one meal a day and' one
meal only, but >it was a ' mighty one,'
washed down with liberal drafts of
wine and beer. ; At 4 o'clock every day
he used to enter a certain' chophouse
and take his seat at a table always re
served for him. A silver tankard con
taining a quart of strong ale, c full
bottle of port and a quarter of a pint of
brandy were placed before him imme
diately. - .
Tho moment the waiter announced
the doctor's r arrival the . cook ' put a
pound and a half of rump steak on the
fire, and to' while away the time until
the 'steak should be properly broiled
the waiter brought the doctor some
tempting morsel like a broiled chicken
or a plate of fish. When he had eaten
this, Dr. Fordyce drank half of his
brandy and then began on his steak.
While eating the steak he drank the
tankard of ale aid after that the rest
of tho brandy. ' The waiter then un
corked •.!;•' 1-nttle of port, nnd the doc
tor proceeded slowly to enjoy it unlil It
was all gone. He spent an hour and a
half daily at his one meal and after It
returned home to give his lectures on
chemistry, which are still quoted as
classics of that science. He ate nothing
else uiitil the next day, j when ' he re
turned at the same hour to the same'
chophouse for the same sort of a meal.
Dr. Fordyce lived to be sixty-six years
old and ki.'pt up his one meal custom to
the last. .' .: . ;. .
Why the- Joke Fell Flat.
A big,, good natuped farmer • was
awaiting the suburban train, . accom
panied by a handsome Gordon setter.
Two sons of Britain stood near him.
The dog strayed away from his owner,
who was reading a newspaper.
"Hey!" called the farmer. "Come
here, Lor!^:-."f!i." and the dog Imme
diately rau to iiU ieet. '.. V^
One of tlie Englishmen approached
the farmer. . ,• : s. . 2. ';": &i : ' t
"May I ask," he said, "whaV you
called that dog?" ;• :
"Locksmith," said the farmer.
"And why, pray?"
• "Because every time I kick him he
makes a bolt for the door."
There was a general laugh, in which
the Englishman joined. . . ■
When he returned to his companion,
he remarked: .- '-', •
"Most extraordinary name that man
over there calls his dog." ■ %&*■*
"What?" asked his friend.
"Locksmith," replied the first Briton.
"And why such a name?" .
"Because, he says, every time he
kicks Mm he bolts for the door."— St

The Weight of Ice.
The teem.in and • the coalman are
often suspected of giving short weights
— mnybe oftener suspected than guilty;
niaj-bo oftener guilty than suspected.
The means •of testing the weight of
from ten to thirty . pounds of Ice are
-not always at hand In the house, but a
close estimate of the weight can, be
reached by multiplying together the
length, breadth and thickness of the
block in Inches and dividing the prod
uct by thirty. This will give very
closely the weight in pounds, j Thus, If
a block of ice Is 10 by 10 by 9, the prod
uct is 000, and this divided by thirty
gives thirty pounds as the correct

This was more than: the greenhorn

wag took a large pin from his waist
coat and, leaning forward, drove It up
to the head in the sergeant's leg. A yell
that froze the blood of all who heard It,
that made the hair of the jury stand on

Fnrnltnre Polish.
A recipe for a" very superior furni
ture polish given by a dealer in musical
Instruments to a housewife as the
cause for the shining surfaces of the
pianos In his rooms consists of four
tablespoonfuls of sweet oil, four table
spoonfuls of turpentine, a teaspoonful
of lemon juice and ten drops of house
hold ammonia. • This polish must be
thoroughly shaken before using and ap
plied with an old flannel or silk cloth.
Rub briskly and thoroughly, which is
at least a third of the merit of all pol
ishes. Use a second cloth to rub the
mixture Into the grain of the wood and
a third for the final polish. -
Eating a Pineapple.
A Florida fruit grower states that the
natives of the pineapple district never
think of cutting a pineapple across.
They pare it, cut it lengthwise, slice It

lander does his green corn, rejecting
the core. This, th» writer states, not
only improves the flavor, but lessens

An American - capitalist ' who has
made a fortune running far Into the
millions likes to tell a story of his first
business venture and how he saddened
the local grocer. At this time he was
fond of frequenting a public salesroom
near his home where all sorts of bar
gains were offered: *~ ■ '
: One day. l noticed several boxes of
soap of a certain brand which I had
if ten been sent to buy at the corner
grocery. I thought to myself, "That
will go cheap," so I ran to the grocery
and received a promise from the man
In charge to buy as much of the soap
at a certain figure as I could furnish.
Of course . he never suspected that t
could furnish any of it - ■' ■•
I returned to . the salesroom, and
when the soap was put tip I bid It In,
and It was knocked down to me. My
name was demanded, and when I gave
It in a shrill voice everybody laughed,
for I was then only eleven years or
age. . ;
Amused as they were at the sale, the
bystanders were amazed when I bid In
the whole lot of twenty-two boxes. I
had them carried over to the grocery
and received - the price 'agreed upon.
The grocer wore a weary look when he
heard . how j I had obtained the soap.
He said: ■-
"Well, I guess I. could have done that
myself.":
I replied that I guessed he could, too,
but he hadn't— Youth's Companion. . .'
Han Wto Named America.
Few Americans are aware of the fact
that the name of their continent is due
to a German scholar. In 1507 Martin
Waldseemuller, also known as ■ Hyla
eomylus, of St. Die, In the Vosges,
edited a book called "Cosmographite
Introdnctlo," In which he gave a trans
lation of Amerigo Vespucci's descrip
tion of his voyages.
That was just the time when Ameri
go's fame filled the world, while Colum
bus' disgrace overshadowed his merit,
and evidently his name ■ had '.: never
reached the quiet village in the Vosges
when Amerigo trumpeted forth his own
glory. So Hylacomylus proposed that,
since the new continent was, after all.
not a part of the Indies, no name would
suit it better than that of his famous
explorer, Amerigo. ,
The book was read far and wide, and
so quickly was the proposition accepted
that, when later on the true discoverer
was i known, the name was already
rooted too . deeply in general use to
be abolished, and was even extended
to the north part of the continent, while
Hylacomylus had only meant It for
the present South America,— National
Geographic Magazine.
