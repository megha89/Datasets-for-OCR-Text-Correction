JACKSON. AMADOU COUNTY. CAIiItfOK.NIA. FRIDAY. OCTOBER 9. 1008-
Sale of Keystone In Doubt.
A report is runout, Mint the snle of
the Keystone, or rather the option
thereon, has fallen through. The
intending purchasers paid 35000 upon
tho delivery of the agreement, an
other payment of 815000 was to have
been made within ten days after tbe
signing of tbe agreement, and tbifi
was due over a week ago, and It has
not been forthcoming. From this it
la believed that the intending pur
chasers after full investigation oon
cluded not to enter upon tbe task
nnder the agreement. Word oame
over Monday that the entire mill Is
idle, scarcely any one is working
about the property; the electric com
pany has been notified that no more
power will be required. This looks
like a shut-down. The work set out
under the terms of tho option would
have necessitated an outlay ot 8201),
000 or more. Perhaps this expendi
ture dampened the ardor of tbe east*
em capitalists wbo thought of invest
ing. Such an amount would not have
discouraged those conversant with
mother lode mining. Indeed, many
mining men claim that the Keystone
was a cheap property at tbe figure
named.
The question arises whether under
tbe terms of tbe agreement tbe Key
stone Company will not be required
to refund tun 85000 paid on tbe
option.
According to report the mine has
been run at a loss for several years.
It needs exploration work at greater
depth, and this will require a big
outlay.
Died at Mojave.
Wm. 11. Burns, n man well known
iv this and Amador counties whore
he has resided for ten or twelve
years, died at Mojave Wednesday
night last after a short illness from
acute bowel trouble. Mr Burns had
recently removed from Amador City
to Santa Cruz with his wife aud two
daughters, for the purpose of giving
tbe latter better educational advant
ages, and receiving a good otter to go
to Kaudsburg, left bis family at
Santa Cruz and went out to the desert
mining camp, where he was seized
with bis fatal illness. Ho started
back home but succumbed at Mojave.
Mr Burns was a native of Ohio and
b'.l years of age. Besides his wife
aud two daughters mentioned, be
leaves two married daughters— Mrs
Lawrence L. White and Mrs A. L.
Palmer both of Amador City. Ho
was a brother-in-law of Grant and
Seymour Hill and Al. J. Williams of
El Dorado. He formerly ran tbe
eugine at the Union mine at El
Dorado, and there, as in the other
places where he has resided, he is
held iv the highest esteem, and
many friends will sympathize with
his bereaved family in their suddeu
aud overwhelming sorrow. He was
a member ot Henry Clay Lodge No.
,95, F. aud A. Al. of Sutter Creek,
under whose auspices the funeral will
be held at Union church, El Dorado

Big Ball Game for Sunday
Next Sunday promises to be very
interesting for the patrons of base
ball. Arrangements have been made
for a game on the grouuds ot the
local olub between tbo social and
athletic olub team, aud a nine from
Sacramento. The line-up of the
visiting team is given as follows:
Catcher, Louman; pitcher, Cox or
llauser; first base, Sheehau; second

Water Shortage.
Last Saturday the Standard Kleo
trio Company notified Mrs Hichtmyer,
the proprietress ot the local water
works, that on account of threatened
shortage of the liquid element, tbe
utmost economy must hereafter be
practiced in the use ot water. Tbe
sprinkling of vegetable gaidens,lawus
and streets must be stopped. Mia
liiobtmyer notified her customers to
that elteot tbe same day. Any viola
tion of tnis request will be apt to be
followed by tbe cutiug otf of tbe
water supply for all purposes.
A curtailment of tbe water used by
the city in street sprinkling is also
necessary, until the winter rains re
plenish tbe watersheds and storage
reservoirs. Tho mines have been
notified of the impending famine so!
as to be prepared iv case it beoomes
neoessary to shut tho supply oft
wholly or partially. Unless copious
rains come within tbe next two weeks
the probability is that tho mining in
dustry will be temporarily crippled.
However, Amador county has been
very fortunate in regard to the water
supply. There has been but trifling
interference with the mining business
on this score for many years. The
requirements of the local interests in
regard to water have always been
deemed paramount. As long as there
is water to be had, tbo mines of
Amador will be given the precedence.
Bradshaw for Constable
Retires in favor of McKenzle
At the republican district conven
tion held in Volcano tor the purpose
of making a nomination for coustable
to Oil tbe vacancy caused by the
death of T. C. MoKenzie, there was
but one candidate for the position.
Clarence Bradshaw received the
nomination by acclamation. 'The
election is for the unoxpirad term,
which runs uutil January, 1911. The
certificate of nomination was ■ Bled
with tbe county clerk on Saturday.
It is reported that C. Elmer Mc-
Keuzie, the sou of tho deceased con
stable, will run au an independent
candidate for tho ofilce. We have
not beard of tbe ' democrats putting
up anyone for the position.
Clarence Bradshaw, aftoi looking
over the situation, concluded to re
sign, and ieave the Held to Mo-
Kenzie. McKeuzie has no oom
petitor, tho democrats having failed
to make a nomination, lie is the
right man for tbe olHce, and as an
independent, under the ciroum
stnuces, would have defeated auy man
that could have been pitted against
him by either party. His political
alllliatious have been with the re
publicans. It was a graceful tbing to
leave the Held clear for him.
Birthday and Reception Party.
A Jjoiut birthday aud leceptiou
party was given at tbe residence of
Mrs P. (Jueraid on Tuesday evening.
It was for the double purpose of
oelebrati'ug the birthday of Mr
Guerard, aud also as a reception to
Mrs Lomiu as delegate from the looal
lodge of tbe Degree of Honor to the
grand lodge which met in San Fran
cisco last mouth. Tho guests were
coufined to members of the order. It
is customary for the members to give
a reception to the graud delegate
upon her return from tbe grand lodge
but this year Mrs Guerard tendered
this honor at her own expense.
About fifteen members were present
,an<l spent a most enjoyable evening.
The hootess provided an elegant
supper for the company.
The Glavlnovich Failure.
The store of JL, 'J. (ilavinoviuli is
still closed, and in tbe charge of tbe
Hluiiiir. it is believed, however, that
a compromise will be effected on tbe
tjnsie, so it is reported, of fifty cents
on tbe dollar. The board of trt.do
cteditois have agreed' to tbe terms
offered, and are now endeavoring to
cot those creditors who do not belong
to the board of trade to aocept tbe
same terms. The outside creditors
comprise fully one-third of . the
liubilities. It takes time to secure
the consent of these scattered
creditors. No doubt tbey will all
tall in with the arrangement and if
so the store will be reopened shortly.
Cilavinovicb, if a settlement is effect
ed, iutends to close out, and go into
business elsewhere.

MINING NOTES.
Original Amador.— At this mine
they have oommenced ["grading for a
transformer, with the intention ot
substituting electricity us tbe motive
power, instead of the present gaso
liuo hoist it is expected to have the
new power installed within two
months.
Keyetone.— Only four stamps of
the mill were in operation the first
part of the week, the old company
cleaning up all in sight, before turn
ing the property over to tbe new
management. A large umbor of men
have been laid off, and many have
left, making tbe town quieter than it
Inis been for years. The outlook for
Amador, However, was never brighter.
There is no doubt that with develop
ment work judiciously prosecuted the
Keystone will ere long rank with tbe
iiest producing mines of the county.
The youth Spring Hill— Another
prospective rich property is likely to
commence active work betnre long.
With tbe J Junker Hill and Fremont,
both in a measure tributary to the
town, the outlook is very encourag
iug for the business interests of this
hustling little camp.
Uay State. — The work of. unwater
mg the shaft is progressing slowly.
It has been freed below tbe four him
died level, aud it will require con
siderable time to get to tbe bottom,
the shaft being over 1000 feet deep.
The unwateriug has taken much
longer than was anticipated, owing
to difficulties ot caves and other
drawbacks.

An Efficient Teacher Retires.
With tbe close ot this school week
Mies Alice Gartlin retires from the
Jackson public school. She tendered
her resignation some weeks ago, but
consented to remain at her post until
tbe trustees could securo a suitable
teacher to (111 her place. Miss Vnnnie
McLaughliu has been engaged to till
the vacancy, and will enter upon her
duties next Monday.
Miss Gartliu has beeu teaching iv
the schools of Amador county for the
past twenty years, and for tho last
ten years has been employed in the
Jackson school. Such a protracted
term of continuous employment in
one place is in itself a tribute to her
efficiency as an instructor of children.
It is only a simple act of justice to
say that Miss Gartlin has justly
earned the reputation of being one of
the best teaohers Amador county has
ever had. and her retirement will he
regretted in educational circles. She
is well posted in all tbe details of
teaching, and has tho rare faculty of
being able to impart instruction to
others, as well as to maintain dis
cipline among those intrusted to her
care. After her long service she felt
that she needed a rest, and hence
resigned for that purpose. It is to
be hoped for tbe iuterest of tbe
public that her retirement from the
schoolroom is not permanent, and
that after a vacation she will re-enter
the field of labor for which she has
proved herself so well fitted.
For Chronic Diarrhoea.
"While in the army in 18(i:j. 1 was
taken with chronic diarrhoea," says
George M. Felton of South Gibson,
Pa. "1 have since tried many
remedies but without auy permanent
relief, until Mr A. W. Miles, of this

CITY OFFICIAL PAPER.
FRIDAY OCTOBER 9, 15)08
DESERTING BRYAN.
While some democratic papers, banking more upon the
party name and organization than upon any fixed principles
represented thereby, are striving to make light of the fact,
there is no doubt a serious /defection of old-line democrats
from the standard of Bryauism. ,The deserters include men
of character and intellect who have heretofore stood high in
the councils of the party, and whose opinions have been
given due weight by their political conferees. M. S. Tarpey
of this state is a fair type<df rthese< deserters. They are to be
found in every state in the Union. In one state two persons
nominated on the Bryan electoral ticket have stepped down
and out because of their iinability to keep step to the many
"isms" of Bryan. Of course, the office-holding and office
seeking class profess to swallow the hodge-podge stuff dished
up for them by the man from Nebraska as a party platform.
They do so from motives -of -sdf+interest, although ever and
anon one possessed of more moral; courage than the average
raises the voice of protest, and|announces his repudiation of
Bryan democracy. The Ibolters. are denounced by the bread
and-butter wing as weak-kneed, wobbling democrats, wheieas
in truth they constitute the bone and sinew and life blood of
the party. They are disgusted ;at -the Bryanite tactics of
trying to patch up a platform with fhe-idea of catching every
bunch of stray votes in the country. The reaching out to
accomplish the impossible — namely to frame a declaration of
party principles that will suit every individual — is a perilous
undertaking. It is generally as effective in scattering as in
attracting votes. So Bryan is fmding.out in this campaign
as he did in his two previous campaigns. Stalwart democrats
•don't know what to make of his assault upon the courts in
the anti-injunction plank; financiers are scary of his plan of
the guarantee of private depositors in ibanlks by the national
government ; manufacturers are afraid of his proposed
methods of tariff revision. And so prominent cases of de
fection are cropping up all around, and his long-nursed
hopes of being the chief magistrate of the nation are fading
away for the third and last time. In Bryan's first campaign
Clevleland.the foremost democrat and president of the United
States was against him on his free silver platform. iHe was
roundly abused by the same crowd that hold party fealty
above everything else; but today his memory is honored by
men of all political creeds for the lofty patriotism Ihe mani
fested on that occasion. Bryan's views today, shifted some
what it is true from the political gospel jhe preached twelve
years ago, are just as visionary and inimical to the pros
perity of the country as they were in 1896. People fiock to
hear him now as they did then. The music of his voice is
still potent to charm them; but as fhead of this nation they
want none of his kind, They prefer the well-beaten paths of
republisau rule, which has never failed to bring about pros
perity.
The capital removal question is scarcely heard of in this
campaign. It made a great furore when the bill authorizing
its submission to a vote of the people was before the legisla
ture. The scheme seems to have died at its birth. At any
rate it is a dead issue now. The governor is not required by
the act to include the issue in his election proclamation. It
will doubtless get on the ballot in some way, and be voted
down overwhelmingly.
The contest for supervisor iv the fourth district is warm"
jug up. D. Fraser, incumbent and democratic candidate for
reelection, is working hard to hold his seat. Fred Werner
is equally hard at work to displace him, with strong hopes
of success. Surely the taxpayers arc anxious for a change
in the board, a change in road management, and the upset
ting of ring methods. A vote for Werner, the republican
nominee, will contribute to these worthy ends.

Incident* That Greatly Surprised c
Vititor From Germany.
On his first visit to the United
Ktateß a German manufacturer wns
the guest of a klnsmnn in Mew York
lie expressed surprise when, a few
days nftcr his ntrtVal, he saw v lium
ber of men help themselves to papers
at an unattended newsstand, where
some men laid down the exact price
of their purchase, others mnde change
for themselves and still others walked
away without paying. He was told
that the ln«t named group were custom
crs who paid only once n week, bui
that no one «ver failed to pay.
To demonstrate his contention that
"most people are honest in this coun
try" the Americanized German took
his visitor that dny to a restaurant
where both were unknown, and when
they had finished their luncheon the
host wont to the cashier's desk with
hl3 check nnd said he had no money
with him, but would pay the next
day. ,'J
The cashier gave tho couple a hasty
glance and said, "All right; I'll take a
chance," and tho men started for the
street. At tho door a right about face
movement was executed, the check was
paid, a good cigar was handed to the
cashier, to whom the plot was re
vealed, and the German exclaimed,
"Grossartlgl" (magnificent). — Chicago

A CINGALESE DAINTY.
Ceylon White Ants and Their Numer-
ous Natural Enemies.
It is estimated that two-thirds of the
Island of Ceylon is undermined by
white ants. The number of these in
sects is certainly quite incalculable, but
it is fortunate that their natural ene
mies are almost as numerous.
The workers are preyed upon by true
nuts and many other Insects; by spi
ders, lizards and centipeds; by rats,
mice and palm squirrels. But it Is
the adult winged Insects that are espe
cially victimized. It Is probable thnt
scarcely 1 per cent of the mature In
sects survive the dangers of the pe
riodic fights.
They run the ganUet of nearly ev
ery other animal. Birds, bats, squir
rels, rats, toads and lizards all flock
to. the feast. Dogs and cats eat the
winged ants with avidity.
"Even men himself does not disdain
to participate," says K. E. Qreen. "The
Tamil cooly looks upon a mess of
fried termites as a great dainty, and I
have several European acquaintances
who consider that termites on toast
form a dish worthy of more general
inclusion In the menu. They are said
to taste not unlike mushrooms."—Agri

The Warning Signals.
A Boston physician tells a story of a
youngster of his own that an over
strenuous vacation had put on the sick
list. The father had an appropriate
prescription filled and left the 'bottle
with the child's mother. As she, how
ever, is very forgetful, he gave her a
chart and suggested that she set down
the hours when the medicine should
be given, checking on* each dose as
taken. Upon returning from his even
ing calls, however, he found the chart
blank.
"Good gracious, Mary!" he exclaim
ed. "Surely you haven't failed to give
Tom his medicine?"
"Oh. no. I did not miss a single
time," his wife assured him.
"How in the world did you remem
ber it without the chart?" he asked.
She smiled.
"That was easy. I just told Tom
this morning at what hours he was tp
have It, and half an hour before each
time he would begin hallooing that he
wouldn't take it."— Philadelphia Ledg

Tho French Are Good Travelers.
The French on their travels ure the
very reverse of the English. Imper
turbably amiable, they never grumble
and without the slightest effort, as a
mere matter of course, make the best
of everything. I have made journeys
with many French friends of both
sexes, young, middle aged and elderly,
often In out of the way places meet
ing with discomforts enough. Nothing
mines their temper. Pleased to en
joy fresh scenes with a genial com
panion, they extract the utmost pos
sible pleasure from every incident, even
little annoyances being turned to good
account. — Miss Bctham-Edwards in
London Chronicle.
What He Would Keep.
When the lute Francois Coppee was

"Suppose your nomination were

"I don't know what I should do
with the nomination," said lianvllle,
"but I should certainly keep the
salver."

Descriptive Article
Amador county comprises an ryea of
8 square mile*. It llos on the we9
m slope of Sierra Nevada mountains,
id embraces within Us territory nil
c diversity of vnlloy, foothill, nnd
<jli mountainous lands.
Climate.— The climate of tho popti
us portions of tbe county Is as gonlal
id healthful as can be found anywhere
California. As climate Is ono of tho
ost valuable assets of this favored
ate In attracting population, Amador
inds second to no county in thla re
i,rd. It should, and no doubt will in
mo, when its climatic advantages are
ore thoroughly understood and ap
•ociated, become a health resort not
ly for those in less favorod states,
if, for the residents of other parts of
tllfornia. The toraperaturo alone the
ntral portion raroly fulls below 30
'greos abovo zero in winter, and as
rely rlsc9 to 100 degrees in tho sum
;r. Snow seldom falls In tho settled
itrlcts, . and never remains on tho
ound for more than a few hours. • Of
urso, In tho high mountain regions
eastern Amador the snowfall is vory
avy— which Is characteristic of the
tiro Sierra Novada range. Tho bum
3t- seuson id alway accompanied with
ol nights; permitting of sound, re
)shlag slumber. Fogs aro rare, cy
mes are unknown, thundurstorms are
'roquent. :
Gold Mining.— The county, although
:h in other sources or wealth, com
ratively untouched, is noted prln
)ally for her quartz mines. The
epcstgold mines in Amorica uro lo
ted here. The Kennedy mine is now
king gold in liberal quantities from
art/, extracted from a depth of over
JO feet below tho surface, with every
lication that tho pay-oro extends to
nuch greater depth. Since tho dis
very of gold, tho county has contrib
ed fully $100,000000 to the world's
pply of the precious metal. . The
incs lire still yielding at the rate of
out two million dollars annually,
sarly all of this wealth is produced by
jht or ten mines operating on what
called the "mother lode," stretching
■,ar across the county In a north-east
ly direction a distance of twenty
lea. The mines aggregate betweon
3 and 500 stamps, and furnish em
>yment for. over 1000 miners. This
luitry is still In its infancy. The
explored territory, even along tho
tin gold belt, is far In excess of tho
onnd that has actually been worked
prospected. The county offers to
y ono of. the most inviting fields to
found anywhere in the world for the
,-estment of capital in the fascinating
sinoss of gold mining, not alone along
<: mother lode, but also in the almost
touched mineralized country ot the
5t belt, some ten or twelve miles from
•5 main lode.
Besides gold, we havo copper, de
sits of pottery, coal, imarbe, slate,
aestone, granite, and soapstone or
le— all undeveloped.
Agricultural Capabilities.— The agri
ltural possibilities equal, if not excel,
0 mineral riches. The valley lands
11 produce anything that can be
own in the most favored sections,
the foothill lands all kinds of decide
us fruits thrive: also all kinds of
getablo are raised where irrigation
i)racticable along the numerous water
irses. Further up in tho mountains,
an altitude of 2000 to 2500 foet, the
I is admirably adapted for apples
d potatoes. A ready market for
my times the quantity now raised, of
jse commodities can bo found lln' the
rious mining towns.
rarJe culture and winetnaking are
joining important industries, both
3 grapes and wino commanding 1 a
tter price than itho product of the
viand.
L.and is cheap compared with other
lifornia lands. Improved farms may
secured for one-fourth the price
rront in some places. Unimproved
ids can be had f rom $5 to $10 per
•c. It does not requlro a fortune to
y a small ranch. Thero is room for
irgo addition to our agrlculural pop
tlon. Vast tracts now devoted to
tie ranges might bo mado the homes
hundreds of prosperous farmers.
Vmador has a population of less than
100, Threo fourths of this is concen

BRYAN THE SOUP
HOUSE CANDIDATE.
Why American Labor Sees Its Hooc
In the Elfction of Taf t and
•Sherman.
An extensive limuinr spread over
one ot tbe sltnnt.s of lower Now York,
where repeatern hnve their linr, aud
TiHMtnnny hirelings are trained to
vote early nnd ufteu, tells thn passer
by to "take a night oft' to see the
liroadway brnarl line, and tbeu vote
for lirymi nud Keru nud bring nbout
n ohnnge in these condition*."
Thn suggestion that a cbaago in con
ditions would be brought about by
tbe election ot liryan nud Kern is
true onougb, judging from pnat ex
perience, if liryiin should be elect
ed, and a democratic) adtniniHtratlon
inaugurated, New York would have
soup liouci'H in additiou to tbe bread
line, and n good many otbor placeß
would hove soup houses too. I'or
ninny years, in times prosperous or
otherwise, there has beon a broad
line in New York. With inhabitants
numbered by the millions, with flot
sam aud jetsnm from all parts of tiio
Union and nil parts ot tbo globe,
New York has always bad more or
less poverty, and tbe broad lino pre
sents part of tbe charity which re
liovns tbe immediate wants of tho
homeless wanderer and the utterly
destitute.
I'or more tbau a quarter of n cen
tury, however, the soup house has
beon speoially characteristic of a
democratic national administration.
In 189J-5-0, when the demoorata wore
hist in control of national affairs,
and bad suuceodod in bringing nbout
revision of tbe tariff, according to
democratic ldeaa of what tbo tariff
ought to be, industry was paralyzed,
business at a standstill, factories worn
closed, and villages that had been
flourishing under republican protec
tion, became ecoues of hunger and
suffering. Manufacturers wbo had
been bard hit in pocket by their own
operatives who had voted to blast thtv
very industries that supported them,
wote called upon to contribute, and
did humanely contribute to start
soup houses and other aids for those
same operatives. business men in
New York aud other cities also con
tributed largely, aud tbe soup bousn
continued to be a national institution
until the democracy wont out of
power, and a republican administra
tion started the nation agaiu on a
career of prosperity, gave employ
ment to labor, aud- abolished the
soup house by abolishing tbe causes
which made tbe soup house necessary.
Tbe election of Uryan on bis plat
form of a tariff for revenue only
would halt American industry in its
steady progress toward better times,
it would shut tbe gates now opening
to unemployed labor, it would close
the puree of capital, and stop tbe
march of enterprise. Two classes
would benefit by Idryau's election—
tbe class of absolute leisure, with
"money to burn," whu could spend
that money on European made goods
without having to pay the duty wbich
republicans have imposed to protect
the American worker, and tbe worth
less vagrant, wbo would not woik
under any circumstances, and who
could get free soup at the Uryan soup
bouses. Every element contributing
to the industry, activity and vitality
of tbe nation would suffer from tho
Uryamte blight, nnd for tbe honest,
self-respeotiuK wage-earner free soup
doled out as charity would be a
miserable substitute iudeed for week
ly wages aud a bappy home.
The election of William 11. Tatt
means that prospects already bright
will continue to' grow brighter, that
there will be work for all and pros
perity for all. Henry C. Hunter,
commissioner of the national trade
association, has publicly stated that
there will be no out down in wages,
because business is improving. Tbe
savings banks report that deposits
are increasing, aud they are gaining
many new depositors. All sigus
point to steady betterment, provided
there shall be no obstacle placed in
the path of itupiovement. The elec
tion of la ft and tibermau will Hssure
business confidence, industrial pros
perity, and increasing employment
for labor. The vision, of iiryan and
the noup liotiso will give place to tbe
reality of tbe weekly wage, tbe .com
fortable home, aud tbe growing sav
ings bauk account, and that is. why
intelligent labor sees its hope in
l'n ft aud refuses to be led into chaos
aud despair by I'rynn.

A LOST JOKE.
Would Be Imitator of a Witty Man
Made a Ludicrous Finish.
Congressman Quarlcs used to tell
this: "I was v guest of n leading
banker at dinner, one of . your Js'ew
York giants of finance, who bad 'In
vited nearly a score of us to eat a bit,
drink v bit and tuvnp notions. Every
thing was lovely until the ly'th course.
The waiter was bringing In what ap
peared on the menu us "langue fumee
nu.t eplsards.' what we common old
roustabouts call smoked beef tongue
with spinach- and my favorite dish.
He tripped at the door aud spilled the
tongue and ifrcous on the carpet. The
host, equal tr> I!k> bccHslon, relieved us
all. especially the waiter, by saying
Jovially: 'There's no harm done, gen
tlemen. 'Tls merely a lapsus linguae.'
It WBB about the cleverest play of
words I ever heard.
"Among tbe guests was a Broadway
merchant, up from the gutter, worth
about $3,000,000 and proud of his vo
cabulary, which was not unlike Mrs.
Malaprop's," continued Quarles. "He
shook with merriment at the banker's
wit The happy effect induced him to
give a dinner the following week, with
about the same guests, and, as I hap
pened to learn afterward, he had di
rected his servant to let fall a piece of .
roast beef on the floor. The servant
faithfully performed his part. Down
went a splendid first cut. weighing
about fifteen pounds, the delicious
Juices spattering everywhere. We all
felt hurt at the accident. Some even i
groaned. 'Be not uneasy, my friends,' !
chirruped tho would be witty host
' 'tis only a lapsus linguae.' " — New
York Press.
Ono View of the Kiss.
The olfactory kiss is Mongolian. The
nutritive affair Is European. The Mon
golian kiss Is with the nose. The Eu
ropean kiss is with the mouth.
The Mongolian kiss indicates that
the party sniffed would be an agree
able prey. The European variety indi
cates tbat the party embraced would
make a delectable meal.
They are but the different forms of
the same instinct of preservation— the
give and take of wild beasts.—Ex
change.
Art of the Superior Smile.
The superior smile Is a useful accom
plishment for any young man. It Is
much In vogue at the universities,
where It may be studied at its best on
young Don. Many men who ' learn
nothing else at the universities learn
this art and find It uncommonly useful
In after life. It 1s an exceflent . cover
for a naked mlud and should be sought
after by parliamentary candidates.—

vehicle over the umbaukmeut, und
the whole outfit, including the
driver, went rolling over aud over to
the bottom of the gulch, fully one

the story is that no serious damugo
was done to man, horse or buggy.
Some toamsters happened along at
the time, aud by meuiiu of ropes the
horse aud buggy was pulled up into
the highway, Duwniuu was able to
scramble up himself, escaping with
merely a few scrutinies. He druve ou

indulged in as to what waa "doing."
One of the boys who escaped is
about 16 years of age aud the other
18, both being quite well grown,
it is likely that they partod company

neither bad any means with which to

FATHER AND DAUGHTER
FORM A MANY SIDED FIRM
in the recorder's oliieo there has
been filed an agreement between
Henry Perneone, living at Knights
Ferry, and Mrs Hosalie Cimo Morlte.
Its provisions are peculiar. In briul'
they specify :

lieu thereof. Should she elect she
can instead of cither piau, form a
partnership with her father, shares
in the property, which is the Diugley
farm, to be equal. In case tho place
is sold she is to receive 3100 U. .Should
there be a dissolution of the con
tract, dhe is required to purchase a
home to be not Jess than one mile
from Sonera or within a distance of
fifteen miles of eithor San Francisco
or Los Angeles.
Following this condition, should
the raucih be sold, the father is to

all bills for goods aud groceries.
While ou the farm she is obliged to

She is deprived ot the privilege of
having both her daughters with her
at the ranch. They shall take turn

THAT SIXTH SENSE.
Clairvoyants and persons of an In
tensely superstitious nature are some-
times Raid to possess n "sixth sense"
— that le, they ore conscious of the
existence of things which nro not to
be realized through taste, touch,
sight, smell or hearing.
Hut such mi appeal to tho brain
can hardly be snid to be through
any body "sense," nud thorefore
tho "sixth eonso" referred to does
not really belong iv that category.
Soleuco points out, however, that
cortatn animnls huvn the advantage
over man that they ere actuated by
not merely six senses, but In some
oases by even additional ipeolal
sense?, in describing somo of those
phenomena in the Paris Cosmos, tho
naturalist, E. ileriobar, eayß:
"A Fi'iini h di'llinid by Ilio uf.tion
of n certain exultant on tho organs,
followed by h pheuomouon of cou-
HCiousnesH dilihmlt. to doflno.
"Vision is tho action ot light on
tho eye— v woll-fleHuod surface, of
antilogous constitution iv nil animals;
but even when the oyo does not exist
there may still bo reaction to light,
ns in the earthworm. This has boen
culled a 'dermataptto' seutmtiou.
"Ordinary seusitivoness to light
muy bo subdivided Into two parts— n
luminous and a chromatic snnee —
light aud color. Touch mnv similar
ly bo subdivided into a sensation of
contact or pressure and one of tem
perature, lv the patbi.logio condi-
tion kuown us 'syringomyelia,' char
acterized by th« alternation of tho
gray substance of the spinal marrow,
this (lilferoutiiitiou of- touch is shown
spontaneously; tho sensations of pain
and of tomperance are abolished,
while that of contact remains un
affected. Touch should thereforo be
divided into three subsonses—sensi
tiveness to pressure, beat and pain.
"Along this line man is not always
us wot I endowed as certain animals
with special sense-organs; thus, the
differences of pressure iv tho medium
where he lives manifest themselves
to him only more or less vaguely by
impressions of well-being or dis
comfort; wbilo the fish, provided
with n swimming bladder, feels so
precise a sonsation, when obliged to
rico or sink in the water, that, he
is enabled to resume his normal posi-
ion by the action of this organ.
"On the other band, in certain
ocean io cepbalopods, there have beeu
found, on the caudal fin, special
eyes with opaque lonseß, organs
adapted to the perception of heat
rays. ;
"Senses simply differentiated in
man may be found isolated in
animals. ' I'he sensations of hunger,
hirst, the reaction of the blood on
the brain cells, also constitute sup
plemontury senses; such, too, is the
muscular sense that gives the impres
sion of weight and the sense that
furnishes au idea ot the shape of
bodies.
"As regards hearing, even when
there is .no auditive seuso, there
may exist a sensibilty to vibartion,
residing in the bones. This is very
delicate in fish and in certain worms,
"Among special organs of sensation
animals we may note the horny bulbs
along the nervures of mosquitoes, for
indicating the periodicity of wing
movements, and the orgau in which
resides the sense of vertical ity in the
medusa— a sort ot pendulum, whose
contact with oue side or the other of
the cavity in which it hangs betrays
an inclination from the normal up
right posture.
"it is also a 'sixth sense' that in
forms au animal of its movements by
means of the displacement of fluid in
the semi-circular, canals of the ear.
This is the cause in man of tho dizzi
ness due to rotation; when we stop
turning we seem to be turning iv the
opposite direction because the inertia
of this fluid maintains it in motion.
This phenomenon does not exist lv
deaf mutes."
It has beou said that the form ot
nausea known as sea sickness is
caused by the constant agitation of
this fluid in a receptacle so close to
the brain during the victim's cou
staut effort to maintain a vertical
position— the "sense" of verticality
being also located in these canals,
aud therefore seeming to be really a
true "sixth sense. "— Datyon Journal.
How Thlnas Are Reversed In Japan
Iv Japan the natives have a habit
of reversing nearly everything,
according to our accepted ideas of
how things should be done. i'hus, a
Japaoeso workman pulls the plane

bellows with bis feet, the cooper holds
tubs with Ins feet, and nearly every
one sits down to work. Horses are

' As in some other lands, tho man is
legarded as a being vastly superior
to tho woman, nud the birth of a
girl is never regarded un a blessing.
Indeed, it often happens iTml; both
father and mother resort to the un
availing folly of tears and lamenta
tions when it ia announced that a
uewcomer is a girl. A boy ran be
come a great fisherman or n great
bunter, while a girl— ot what use. is
she? A mere cumberer ot the earth,
regardless ot tho fact that sho works
ns many hours a day us, and even
more than a man wheu sbo reaches
the goal of her ambition and marries.
Not to marry is as sad a misfortune
as may befall her, and it she is
married and widowed she makes all
possible haste to securing a second
partner.
HE SILENCED HER.
Dinner had been over only ten
minutes when Jones made a move
down the hall for the ball tree and
his hat, and the long-suffering Mrs
Jones followed alter to say.
You have boon out every night for
a month. How long is this thing to
last?
"Only until the campaign closes,
my dear."
"But 1 don't see that it is necessary
tor you to be out every night until
midnight. Last presidential eleotion
you were not out a single evening.
In fact, you said the men who were
whopping around nights were a pack
of soft-heads."
"So they were dear, but last eriui
paign is not this campaign. Last
campaign things ian themselves, and
there was nothing for the patriots to
do. Now the country calls upon
every one of them. Mrs Jones, the
very life of our country is banging
in the balance.
"The bulwarks of liberty are totter
ing to their fall.
"Shall this country be ruled by
pariots or traitors?
"Is Bunker Mill to go for nothing,
and axe our liberties to be sold for a
mess of pottage?
"Shall 1 stand supinely by and see

''Shall the American eagle still

"Why, Thomas, is it as bad as

"It's worse. The next gale that
sweeps from tha'North—
"Thou hurry right along and be

and In such intermittent work the
machine easily runs four or five

Samples of pure air iiom a height
of HUj miles have been collected by
Teisaereuo de liort, tbe Freucb in
vestigator, in bis observations on tbe
rare gases, especially argon, ueon and
helium. The collecting apparatus— a
vacuum tube drawn out to a tine
point at one end— was carried up by
a large sounding balloon. At tbe
desired height, an electromagnetic
device operated by a barometer broke
off the point admitting the air, and
a few minutes later a second oontact
sent a battery current through a
platinum wire around the broken end
melting the glass' and sealing tbe
tube. All samples thus obtained
show argon and ueon, no helium be
ing found in air from above six
miles.

Why Colds are Dangerous.
Because you have contracted ordin
ary colds and recovered from (hem
without treatment of any kind, do
not for a moment imagine that colds
are not daugerous. Everyone Knows
that pueumonia and chronic catarrh
have their origin in a common cold.
Consumption is not caused by a cold
but tbe cold prepares tbe system for
tbe reception, nnd deveiopmeut of tbe
germs that would not otherwise have
found lodgment. It is tbe same with
all inflictions diseases. Diphtheria,
scarlet foyer, measles and whooping
cough are much more likely to be
contracted when the child has a cold.
You will ccc tram this that more real
danger lurks in a cold than in auy
other of thn common ailments. The
easiest and quickest way to cure a
oold is to take Chamberlain's Uough

effected by this preparation have
ruiiciß it a staple article of trade over
a large part of tbe world. Kor sale by

A WOMAN'S TACT.

It licliik a holiday, the Miimlevln.a

"Julia is engaged,?

that Margaret was BugnffCd, and n^nin

engagement that wnn broken to tlwm.
A a before, tho man's ■wife put theqiies

On tlielr way home the man said:
"Why did you nr.k 'which one' every
1 1 mo n new engagement was sprung
on ua? Are those girls so attractive
that men were falling over each other
!n tlio scramble to get them for their
wives?"
"Not nt all." said his wife. "I don't
suppose either of them over had tint
one offer, and It Is n wonder she sot
that. I shouldn't be surprised if tho
men back out even now before the
wedding day. Hut you see, dear. 1 had
to be diplomatic. Those people can do
mo many favors. The surest way to
make myself solid with them is to pre

every man In town was crazy to marry

FOES OF THE LEVEES.
Sources of Danger to tho Artificial
Banks Alone the Mieciseippi.
"People who know little about our
system of levees, the artificial banks
built to confine tlx» flood waters that
pour into the Mississippi, no doubt
imagine that the heavy rains are the
only enemy with which the levees have
to contend," said a Baton ttouge man.
"On the contrary, tbe levees, both
during times of flood and low water,
are subject to the Incessant attacks of
living foes, the destructive work of
which costs millions of dollars.- These
foes are alligators, turtles, muskrats,
field rats, fresh water terrapin and
crawfish. Of all these burrowers that
prey on the levees, excavating within
them goodly chambers or tunnels, the
crawfish do the most damage, with tbe
turtles and terrapins a good second.
The harm done by the alligators is
comparatively small.
"In repairing the banks crawfish
holes are often found of Immense size.
It is these hollow spaces that in time
of freshets cause a caving in and break
of the levees, which of course bring
on an Inundation of all the adjacent
country. The worst part of the busi
ness Is that no way of 'exterminating
these pests has yet been found, and
the only thing to be done is to try to
keep them away from the banks as
much as possible." — Baltimore Ameri

The Inquisitivo Woman.
Street car conductors regard Inquisi
tive women passengers with supersti
tious dread. The other day a /use
blew out In a Broadway car, and that
car was hitched on ns v trailer to the
one ahead. Presently a woman be
gan to ask questions.
"What would happen." she said, "If
the fuse were to blow out In that car
ahead? What would become of us?
Would the car ahead of that be able
to drag both of these cars?"
"I don't know," said the conductor.
"But don't worry. We won't have a
chance to find out. A double accident
of that kind has never happened to a
car of mine yet, and It Isn't likely to
happen once in a hundred years."
Just then there enme an explosion
ahead, and both cars came to a stand
still. The fuse hud blown out.
"Confound that woman!" growled
the conductor. "That Is all her fault.
This wouldn't have happened If she
hadn't asked so many fool questions.
She's a Jonah."— New York Times.

LOCAL EDITORIAL COLUMN.
VOTE FOR ENGLEBRIGHT.
While the election of Taft is a foregone conclusion, it is
highly important that both branches of congress should be
of the same political faith. As far as as the congressional
fight in this district is concerned, we believe that W. F.
Euglebright, the republican incumbent and candidate for re
election, is too strongly entrenched in the hearts of his con
stituents to be in any danger of defeat. His record as one
of the most tireless aud effective workers ever sent to con
gress from the Pacific coast, recommends him to all classes,
regardless of party. His energy has been directed by sound
judgment and ability to set forth his views forcibly, so that
in the short experience of his congressional life he has gained
a position of influence in the national legislature far above
the average. He is the right man to send back to Washing
ton to look after the interests of the first congressional dis
trict. He should, and we believe will be, returned by one of
the largest majorities ever given to a congressman from this
state. This would be a fitting recognition of the faithful
services already performed. We do not know his competitor
on the democratic side, E. W, Holland of Tuolume county.
He is the present district attorney of that couuty, and said
to be serving the people satisfactorily in that capacity. So is
Englebright in his sphere. It would be a. pity to disturb
either of them. The people are sufficiently alive to their own
interests to keep each one in his present positiou of useful
ness.
ORGANIZE FOR SELF-PROTECTION.
There are mauy ways in which a board of trade, or some
organization of a similar character, would prove a protection
to the business interests of Jackson. Suppose it cost a dollar
a month from every business house to support such an
organization, that sum would be saved many times over in
the course of every year by the more satisfactory business
methods tßat would doubtless result therefrom. "Iv union
there is strength," is true of the business world. A business
man will naturally hestitate, when acting 011 his own respon
sibility, to take a decisive stand against some practice which
he knows to be vicious and wrong, whereas he would be only
too glad to do so in concert with others in the same line of
business as himself. Little abuses flourish ou the natural
timidity of the average man [to assume a position outside
of the beaten path. He often submits to imposition because
others in his line have submitted thereto. To be alone in
protest, even though admittedly in the right, might injure
his business. And so abuses are not only perpetuated, but
actually encouraged to become more and more aggressive,
from sheer lack of organization to present a united front
against imposition.
As an illustration of this point we might cite the practice
of soliciting advertisements from all classes of business and
.professional men to be inserted on the program of every en
tertainment gotten up for some local benefit. Two or three
hundred programs are circulated among the audieuce in the
hall on the uight of the entertainment, and for the privilege
of getting on this advertising medium each advertiser is held
up to the tune of 50c or $1, according to space occupied.
As many as between 50 and 75 advertising cards frequently
appear on one of these programs. The revenue from this
source is a vital factor in the calculations of the promoters of
the affair. This nuisance — for such it is universally voted
t0 be — has been of slow but steady growth. Years ago it
was calculated that if the money from advertising was suffi
cient to pay for printing the programs it was doing well
enough. But now the expectations from this source have
so enlarged that advertisers are supposed to pay for all the
incidental expenses of the show, leaving the receipts from
admissions as clear profits. We understand that some have
resolved to cut loose from th,« sort of useless advertising.
It would be the proper thing to combine for the purpose of
shutting down on this and kindred nuisances which are in
imical to the established business interests of the town.
At the meeting of the board of city trustees held last even
ing an ordinance was introduced by trustee Kirk wood and
read for the first time proposing to increase the retail liquor
license from $15 to $30 per quarter. The ordinance recently
defeated provided for a $45 tax per quarter. So that the new
ordinance is a half-way measure. Whether it will be con
tested by the liquor interests when it come up for final pass
age next week remains to be seen. We presume the purpose
of its introduction and passage between regular meetings is
that it may become effective at the commencement of the next
fiscal quarter in November. The trustees are evidently im
pressed with the necessity of raising more revenue for the
city government, and think the saloons are better able to
stand the raise than any other interest. Estimating the num
ber of retailers at 30, the additional revenue, assuming that
all will be able to pay, will be $1800 per year. As an offset to
this the direct property tax was reduced 5c on the $ioo, mak
ing a total of $300.
AMAI)OR L.EBGEI?, JACKSON, CAL.
A Slander Refuted.
(Communication)
To Hie Editor of the Amador Re
cord, Hutter Creek, Cal.
It whs with the utmost nstontsb*
mnnt tbat I read in jour issue of the
Ist lust, tbat nnytbing derogatory bad
ever been said iv public, or privately
expressed, of the unwortblnesa of the
Knropean laborers; when, as a matter
of fiint. your ancestots were of that
breed of doga called by our aud your
President of thin Kepubllo "tin «ui
desirable class." He (the president)
being of the Dutch Knickerbocker
stock, aud you a menial of Puritanic
persecution; afterwards bottoming
aiders and abettors of tbn horrible
atrocity of the burning of wltabea at
Salem, Massachusetts, In the name of
religion and civil rights.
I'tir your own sake, Mr Day, it is
to be regretted that you were ever led
to jump blindfolded into the eeething
cauldron of un-American race hatred.
On the face of matters it seema that
you, a man of lino feeling, keen of
the sense of delicacy and propriety,
should have nt least the perception,
or conception, of investigation before
engaging in billingsgate. It is not
tho Slavonian race alone that you
assail in your tirade; but the basic
foundation of our constitutional
government. While it is trim your
statements may be mislunding. they
nevertheless lead heedless porsonß
into error aud lend an atom to tbe
gl-oridcation of the idea tbat tbis
country should be governed by the
hands of tbe few— the rioh--not tbe
sinew and hone. In tbis land— tbe
homo of tbe free aud the brave— it
does not become any man to become
so egotistical as to proclaim Himself
a tryant, when it is taken into con
sideration tbat ancestors of tbe author
of the same were exiles and only
came to thin country to escape what
he now would inflict upon others.
The Austrlans, as a lßoe,' are con
structive, not destructive, and if
given a tair opportunity prove them
selves the equal of tbe Dutch or the
proverbial Jew in accumulation of
homos and worldly goods. And even
when, by early environments, they
were deprived of an education, their
first throught is to eduoate their
children iv the language of their
adopted cmintry.
The term "dog eaters" belongs to
tbe class of tho Prosjdont's Ananias
Club aud its appellation doos not
concern us, as we come from a
country of less dogs ana more intelli
gence. In tbe same category might
bo termed the word "Dago," as
applied to Italians. Instead of being
a term of reproach, my friend, Mr.
Day, it is a badge of honor, coming
down as it does for ages, from the
Doges of Venice and Genoa, tbe latter
city the home of Columbus, tbe dis
coverer of America.
You may tbink, Mr. Day, tbat we
are' an illiterate class of people, but
we beg leave to suggest tbat the
annals of history will show that
Austria has produced some of the
most illustrious men and women tbat
have ever appeared upon tbe world's
stage. Among which may be men
tioned tbe ill-fated Marie Antoinette
and Charlotte, tbe latter' the wits of
tbe misguided Maximilian, not to
speak of tbe second wife of Napoleon
the first. In tbe meantime do not
forget Kossutb, the patriot, who
came to tbis country shortly atter tbe
Civil War and by his eloquence and
patriotism aided tbe cause of liberty
in his country to tbe extent of over
$200,000. Any student ot history in
the diplomatic line will remember
the tilts between tbe two greatest
diplomats of their time— Talleyrand
for France and Metternicb — tor
Aapoloon'H aids was worsted iv more
than one bout in regard to changing
tbe map ot Europe, lint wby ex
patiate upon which everybody knows;
but while on tbis subject it might be
well to merely mention the fuct Hint
wheu you are'iu a city of pretentious,
your restaurant meals are invariably
ensooused with Hungarian music.
For wealth aud touch ot scenery,
artistic taste, art, literature, states

Wisdom Air. Taft's Strong Point.
There is a degree of inflexibility
about Mr Taft when be is right, nnd
he knows he ia right, and when the
other man is wrong and inclined to
be Rggressire about ft, that is apt to
surprise thoee who seek to take nd
rnntnge of his boundless good nature,
lln believes in discipline and ho
knows bow to enforce it. When be
was Diet placed in charge of tbe
Panama Canal he received a delega
tion of steam ebovelere who wanted
more pay. They deserved it, and Mr
Tuft favored giving it to them if
possible, but they committed a mis
take. They went at It the wrong way.
J'heir attitude was not conciliatory,
and Dually the spokesman said:
"We'll strike light away If you
ilnnt' agree to give us this* mine "
"Let me understand tbis oorreot
ly," said Mr Taft. "Da you mean
to Hiiy Hint you will strike now; that
you want that raise before I have had
a chance to go into tlia merits of
your claim nnrl deaide, and tbat you
will strike if you don't get it to-day"
"That's light, 1 ' was the retort.
■"Thank you," said Mr TaJt. "Ihon,
gentlemen, will you kindly step out
to hit secretary and hand him your
resignations."
The men retreated. They didn't
want to resign and they didn't, and
finally the matter was adjusted on a
buais which all agreed was just aud
proper.
