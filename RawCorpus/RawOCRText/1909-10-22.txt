Trial of Damage Suit
The damage suit of Van Vranken
against L. Burke and R H. Jameson
was commenced in the superior court on
Mondny morning, before a jury. The
jury was selected from a special venire
summoned by the sheriff, as one of the
defendants is a supervisor and as such
assisted in selecting the jury list for the
current year. The following persons
were selected to try the issue :
John Barton, D. H. Brown, A. L.
Stewart, Geo. A Klrkwood, Chas. E
Olver, W. H. Taylor, S. G. Shealor, J.
S. Avis, Geo. Brown, W. O. Green, H.
C. Hamrick, and Geo. E. Vela.
The plaintiff is the owner of 1(50 acres
in San Joaquin county. In September
1908, the defendants were engaged to
thresh some barley on the plaintffs land,
they being the owners of a steam thresh
ing machine. While so engaged a stack
of unthreshed barley,containing about 00
tons was set fire, alleged to be from
sparks from the engine, and a large part
of it destroyed. Plaintiffs sue for 81533
damages, alleged to be the value of the
grain so destroyed. It was claimed by
the plaintiffs that the fire was caused by
the carlessness of the defendants in fail
ing to provide the smokestack with a
device known as a spark arrester.
From the testimony ie appeared that the
engine was a compound Russell straw
burning engine.
It was the contention of the plaintiffs
that the loss was owing to a lack of or
dinary care on the part of defendants. It
was claimed the thresher should have
been provided with a spark arrester,
and expert engineers stated it was cus
tomary to use such devies for the pre
vention of fires, j Their experience was
with simple engines, which were always
provided with such arrester. On the
othqr hand It was contended in behalf of
defendants that spark arrester was not
necessary on a compound type of en
gine, that the draught was not sufficient
to cause sparks to fall any distance
away. Van Vrankan, the plaintiff,
a lawyer of San Joaquin, conducted
the case in his own behalf, assisted by
W. G. Snyder. C. P. Vicini appeared
for the defendants.
The jury got the case shortly after
Wednesday evening. After/pver- two
hour's deliberation tht'y reported to tne
court that it was impossible to agree,
and were discharged. At first the jury
stood 8 for defendants and four for
plaintiffs; after the second ballot they
stood 7 to 5 in favor of the de/endants.
It is reported that the jury were unani
mous on the proposition that the fire
originated from sparks from the smoke
stack ; but they differed on the point of
negligence. The plaintiffs say they will
try the case again.
Rib Broken
Mrs F. W. Parker fractured a ribjn a
singular manner two weeks ago. She
was lifting a carpet, but is not aware of
having falien upon anything. Shortly
afterwards she felt a pain about the
ribs, and sent for the doctor, who found
that a rib had been broken. She is
recovering as fast as could be expected.
Estray Law.
The estray law was amended in im
portant particulars by the last legisla
ture. One of the new amendments :is
that the finder of estray animals shall
publish for two weeks, one week after
the finding, notice with description of
the animal, with brands, the probable
value of the animal, the place where the
taker-up found and where he has con
fined the animal. If branded or'marked,
and the brand recorded, the finder must,
In five days, notify the owner, and this
notice will take the place of the publi
cation notice and recording. Where the
tinder could before charge 15 cents for
the keeping of horse, mule, jenny, ass,
cow, bull, ox, steer or colt, now he may
collect 30 cents; and where before, for
every sheep, goat, hog or other animal
not specified, he could collect 5 cents,
he may now charge 10 cents.

Died Suddenly in Lodi.
Mrs Augusta C. Wriepjesworth, wife
of George Wrigglesworth, the engineer
of the Zeila, died very suddenly In
Lodi, last Saturday evening, while on a
visit to her daughter, Mrs Raines, in
that city. Mrs Wrigglesworth left her
home in Jackson on Tuesday morning
of last week, to see her daughter in
Lodi, who on the previous day became a
mother. She appeared in her usual
health, although she had been complain
ing of indisposition for some !- time,
which, however, was not considered
serious enough to prevent her from at
tending to her household work, or to
demand the service's of a physician.
While in Lodi she also assisted in the
housework up to the time of the fatal
attack. On Saturday last she prepared
dinner, and partook of the meal with Mr
Raines and the trained nurse, Miss
Mamie Read. As soon as the meal, was
over she went into an adjoining ■ room,
while the attending physician ' and the
nurse repaired to the sick room. In a
few minutes the nurse heard her calling,
and hastened to see what was the
matter. When the nurse got to her side
she was still on her feet, but said she
felt as if she was about to faint. Miss
Read conducted her to a couch, and laid
her thereon. The doctor was summoned
from another room, and everything was
done to revive the patient,' but without
avail. She soon relapsed into 1 pro

Death Claimed
Another Pioneer*
Sarah Ann Serine was born in the
state of Connecticut, September 10th,
1833, and closed her earthly pilgrimage
at Pine Grove, Amador Co. Cal at 3
o'clock Sunday afternoon, October 10th,
1909. Her maiden name was Avey. The
deceased became a Christian in her 15th
year, and united with the Methodist
Episcopal church. She was married to
Fredrick Serine in her 20th year. A
few months after their marriage they
moved to the state of Kansas, ! and re
mained a few years and returned again,
and five years after, in 18(53, came to
California and resided in Pine Grove
until her death. She was the mother of
three children, one died an infant, and
two daughters are living, Mrs Nellie
Rena Werly of Oakland, and Mrs Carrie
Louise Tarr of Idaho, also one sister,
Mrs Louise James of Pine Grove, and
seven grandchildren. She was seventy
six years of age, and made' Pine Grove
her home, and always considered its
people her sympathetic friends, which
was true during her brief illness, as
they waited on her with unstinted kind
ness which was very signally appreciated
by her. The funeral services were con
ducted at the church on Tuesday after
noon, by Rev J. M. Drake. The floral
offerings were numerous and beantiful.
The funeral cortege wended its way to
the Pine Grove cemetery, where all that
remained mortal of a loving mother,
were laid to rest beside her husband
and brother.

Needle in Body for 25 years
Mrs M. J. Ledoux of Sacramento,
:4»»ftrri9 visiting relatives in ffiisi-Siinry/
some twenty-five years ago, when a resi
dent of Oneida valley in this county,
had a needle imbedded in her back. It
gave little trouble at the time, and as
the years passed by little was thought of
the matter. A few weeks ago she felt a
soreness and pain In the right leg near
the thigh. An examination by a relative
revealed a sharp point, which proved to
be the long-lost needle. It was extracted,
and the pain soon disappeared. The
needle was discolored by its long en
tombment in the living flesh. Mrs Le
doux keeps it as a memento of her re
markable experience.

MINING NOTES.
Bunker Hill.— The stock of this mine
is now held at 94 per share, and stock
holders are not over anxious to part
with it at Hint figure. A sale of a small
block was made in Jackson at that price.
The thirty-eighth dividend was paid on
the 15th instant, of four cents per share,
aggregating 88000. The last month's
run was not only sufficient to pay this
dividend, hut also enough to carry a
substantial amount to the surplus as
well.
Argonaut.— Sinking is in progress at
this mine, the 40-stamp mill being kept
going to its full capacity at the same
time. It is the intention to sink 200
feet, which will carry the shaft down to
3350 feet on the incline. The mine is
looking well, and the resumption of
dividends is looked for soon.
Strike Reported. — A strike of rich ore
is reported from Hunts "gulch. Matt
Thomas, in prospecting on a -location
between the Doyle and Champion
mines, discovered a ledge four feet
wide, carrying gold in liberal quantities
The ore is said to prospect in the neigh
borhood of 9100 to the ton. The claim
was formerly located by Matt Thomas
and W. Doyle, at present Thomas claims
to be the sole owner. The strike has
revived the hopes of the mine owners of
that vicinity. There is considerable
gold taken out in pockets in that gulch,
but heretofore no well defined ledge has
been worked to any extent altough a
number of claims promise well to de
velop into paying properties.
Kennedy— The force of miners was
laid off again last Monday, to enable
shaft repairing to be prosecuted. It is
expected that the lay-off will last one
week. Ore has been accumulated in
the ore bins and chutes sufficient to
keep the mill running for that length of
time. When the rock on hand is ex
hausted the shaft will be sus
pended, and the miners started to work
to accumulate another reserve, and in
this way it is the intention to keep the
stamps in motion, and thoroughly repair
the shaft at the same time. How long
it will take to do the necessary repair
work is uncertain, as the decay of the
timbers is not uniform.
The Alokelumne Mining Co. have
taken the buckets off their dredger and
are floating their boat about a mile up
the river on ground they bought on the
Hill ranch. The way they are rushing
things they ought to be digging again in
about thirty days. They will have to
move the transformer, shops, etc., up
there also, which is quite a job for any
one but an expert to tackle.— Prospect.

Looking up the Big Bar Bridge
Matter.
James Keith, district attorney of Cal a
veras county, was in Jackson last Tues
day and Wednesday. His visit was for
the purpose of examining the records in
this county bearing upon tho Big Bar
bridge, to be used in the case now pend
ing, brought by Mrs Gardella, the
bridge claimant, against Calavcras and
Amador counties to quiet her title to
that property. The supervisors of Cala
veras county, when faced with doubts
concerning the title declined to consum
mate the purchase of the bridge at the
agreed price of $8000 until the question
of title was decisively settled by the
courts. Hence the suit. Amador county
is equally intereestcd with Calaveras in
this suit. If Mrs Gardella wins Amador
will have to pay one half the purchase
price and her equal share of tne ex
penses of the suit. The district attorneys
of the two counties are therefore equal
ly interested in defending the suit in
behalf of their respective counties. Mr
Keith came over specially to look up
any data that might have any bearing on
the subject. While here he gained
much information of value in the pro
ceedings from his own personal investi
gation of the records. He is determined
to do his duty and defend the suit to
the best of his ability. If the case goes
against the counties in the trial court,
he will Jtake it to the appellate court,
so that the questions involved may be
finally settled. He informs us that the
demurrer of the defense was overruled
by the court lgst Monday. He is now
engaged in preparing his answer.

AMADOR LEDBER
Published every Friday Afternoon
RICHARD WEBB Editor and Proprietor
FRIDAY OCTOBERS, 1809
THE SUPERVISORS' CONVENTION.
Another meeting of the supervisors of the three counties of
Calaveras, Tuolumue and Araador is scheduled to be held in
Sonora on the 26th and 27th of this mouth. At this meet
ing it is expected that the district attorney of each county
will submit a draft of a liquor license ordinance for the con.
sideration of the convention, although there is no legal
obligation upon them to do so. The organization of the
three counties is not recognized by law, and they are with
outauthoritv to enforce demands upon any county official'
If the attorneys submit drafts of proposed ordinances, "it will
be simply as a matter of courtesy. Business interests are
quick to feel the effect of any proposed change. Indeed a
state of doubt or uncertainty as to what is coming is more
damaging than the actual chauge in the law. We have al
ready had an example of this in the address of E. B. Moore,
assemblyman of this district and a former superviser of this
county, who is anxious that the license question be definitely
settled as soon as possible. He stated to the Amador super
visors at their last meeting that the apprehension of coming
change is injuring business, and depreciating property.
•V -It is reported that neither the supervisors nor the district
attorney of this county will attend the forthcoming meeting
in Sonora. As far as Amador is concerned it may bz said to
be out of the combine. The movement is said to have
originated in Calaveras '< county. A numerously, signed
petition was presented to the board of supervisors of that
county some time ago, asking that some action be taken to
place that county on a local option basis with respect to the
sale of intoxicating liquors. Action on this petition was
postponed from time to time, evidently for political reasons.
To relieve them of the embarassing situation the convention
of supervisors was arranged, the failure of. the supervisors'
convention to take any decisive action on this proposition be
ing anticipated.

Cook regarding the ascent to the summit of Mount

sworm affidavit, deny that he reached the top, and assert that
the highest point attained was fourteen miles from the sum
mit. The doctor claims that the statements have been paid
for by those who are interested in discrediting his story of be
ing the first explorer to reach the north pole. Then again,
Peary brings the statements of the Eskimos who accompanied
Cook on his dash to the pole that the claimant never got any
where near the pole; that he never went out of sight of laud
during the entire trip. The twin statements have materially
weakened the claims of the explorer. He is doing a lucrative
business in the lectnre field, and probably the commercial
end of the affair is the more important just now. The
scientific societies will have to settle the claims of the rival
claimants, and whether they can settle the issue so that it
will stay settled is very doubtful.
The prevailing impression is that for assessment purposes
property in California is listed at a lower valuation in propor
tion to actual value than in any other state. This if far from
the truth: indeed, the reverse proposition is much nearer the
truth, if statistics collected by the Los Angeles Times, under
the stimulus of the 50 per cent increase in the assessment
roll of that county made by the state board of equalization can
be relied upon, and we have no reason to doubt their correct
ness, as they were obtained from official sources. The as
sessed valuation of Los Angeles county for the current year,
being $585,401,164, overtops by over five million dollars,
the valuation of Cook county, Illinois, which includes the
city of Chicago, according to federal figures for the year
1904. The real value of property in Chicago at that time
was over $2,000,00,000, equal to the whole state of California.
There must be something wrong when such glaring inconsis
tencies exist. Owing to the heavy increase in the expense of
government the plan to boost assessments has been adopted
more or less in nearly every state in the Union as the meaus
of providing more revenue.

Of the value of bananas there seems

this conclusion If I lie banana be eaten

TOO COMPLICATED.
Tho Reason We Say "You" Instead of
Using "Thou."
The reason commonly Blveii for the
Bubstltulion of tbo second person
plural for the second person singular,
•'you" Instead of "tuou"-that It origi
nated us n I'ad of courtesy— may ex
plain its origin, but Its universal adop
tion is due to a deeper reason— namely,
that the second person singular of the
verb Is a complicated and difficult
form, while the second person plural
Is simple to the last degree. ,
Wllh every principal verb In the lan
guage and with every auxiliary except
"must" the pronoun "thou" requires a
special change in the form of the verb,
which is often the only break in an
otherwise uniform series. Thus in the
present tense of every verb, with the
single exception of the verb "be." the
pronoun "you" employs the unchanged
root form of the verb, as "you love,
have, can do. shall, will." etc.. while
"thou". requires a change of form, as
"thou lovest. hast, canst, dost, shalt.
wilt." etc.
In every such choice the unchanged
root form has always tho right of way.
Thus "you" has become everywhere
current in the busy activities of life,
while "thon" is carefully laid up In
the museum of antiquity or tjie shrine
of religion.— James C. Fernald In Har
per's Magazine.
Mcking Sure of the Architect.
Nornian-Al-Oouar. an Arabian king
who reigned long, long ago at Hirah.
commanded the architect Sennemar to
build hlln a wondrous palace. This
tho architect did and when It was
done a single stone fastened the whole
structure, aud.the colors of the walls
changed frequently during the day.
The king was greatly pleased and
showered all kinds of rich gifts upon
tho builder with tho lavishness of ori
ental kings. But monarchs were
treacherous In those old days, and It
occurred to the kins that Sennemar
miglit build a palace equal In li;-auty
or even superior for some rival ruler.
The more he thought over it the more
jealous he became until one day he
ordered the architect to be thrown
from the top of tho palace to make
certain that no duplicate palace would
be made. After this the king was sat
isfied that his palace was the only
one. and the Arabians regarded it as
one of the wouders of the world.

A Third Person Present
In the town where Rev. Dr. Emmons
was pastor lived a physician tinctured
with the grossest form of pantheism,
who declared that if he ever met Dr.
Emmons he would easily Moor him in
argument. One day • they met at the
home of r patient. The physician, says
the Nashville Banner, abruptly asked
Dr. Emmons :
"How old are you sir?"
The doctor, astonished at his rude
ness, quietly replied: "Sixty-two;
may I ask, sir, how long you have
lived?"
"Since the creation, ' was the reply
of the pantheist.
"Ah, I suppose, then, you ware in the
Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve?"
"I was there, sir."
"Well, said the wily, divine we all
know there was a third person present.
How HE Got it
The kind lady had just handed the
hungry hobo a sandwich and a hunk of

Flavoring Eggs
The question of feeding flavor into
eggs was practically settled some year?
ago by Prof. F. E. Emery of the North
Carolina experiment station, who tried
feeding onions to hens. With the re
sults that the eggs of all those which
nte the onions showed a more or less
distinct flavor. Therefore it appears
that to get fine flavored eggs it is neces
sary to restrict runs enough so that no
considerable amount of the food can be
of such a character as to yield ill
flavored eggs.

Comfort For The Sleepless.
Finally, should sleep still refuse to
yield to all your wooing, remember that
some of the benefits of sleep can be
obtained without sleeping, writes Dr.
McComb, in Harper's Bazar. Do not
toss and turn and groan, but constrain
yourself to mental and physical quiet
ness. Let the mind rove about among
pleasant memories of brood gently on
the blessing which a kind province has
sent you, or lose itself in a sort of
reverie with thinking about those whom
you love and in whom you are deeply
interested. After all, there is no danger
in a few nights' insomnia. Forget your
insomnia and frequently it will happen
that you will recover your rest. Bear in
mind the- saying of Prof. Dubois,
"Sleep is like a pigeon; pursue it, and
ft Hies from you; keep quiet, do not
trouble about it, and it will come to
you. ' '

mDoctors Must
Record Births.
A letter from the bureau of the census
at Washington telling the State board of
health that it will he useless for it to
send any more birth statistics from
California until some degree of effici
ency can be attained, formed the basis
of a resolution adopted by the State
board Saturday directing Its secretary.
Dr. W. F. Snow, to prosecute nil
physicians, midwives nnd others assist
ing at chid birth who do not register
Ihe birth record as required by law.
Failure to record births is a misde
meanor punishable upon conviction as
other misdemeanors described in the
Penal Code, which means a penalty
from one to six months in the county
jail or fine up to s?50(), or both.
Dr. Snow said he would take iir.
medinte action, and wherever a birth
record is not liled with the" county re
corder or city health officer a pro.se
cutiun will follow. It is largely due to
negligence on the part of physicians
that the certificates of births are not
made a matter of record, said Dr. Snow
but this will be no excuse in the future.
The law gives physicians and others
6ve days in which to file the certifi
cates, and those who fail to do this will
be arrested and tried the same as other
law breakers.
The State board of health has beer,
making frequent requests upon physi
cians to do their duty in this respect.
Each month the official bulletin calls
their attention to the matter, but it
seems 'to have no effect on the majority
of them.
Death statistics are thoroughly satis
factory because the burial permits bring
death records directly 'in touch with the
health authorities.
Not every state in the union has the
privilege of filing vital statistics with
Ihe bureau of the census at Washington,
.30 the State health board is anxious to
jet back into standing on^ the birth re
cord matter. —Exchange.
The Bed-Rock Of Success
lies iv a keen clear brain, backed by
indomitable will and resistless energy.
Such power comes from the splendid
health that Dr. King's New Life Pills
impart. They vitalize every organ and
build up brain and body. J. A. Har
mon, Lizemore, W. Va'., writes: 'They
are the best pills I ever used." 25c at
Spagnoli Drug Store.
Little Home* Cures.
If a speck or splinter gets into the
eye, simply lift the eyelid and blow your
nose, which will force the particle out.
A severe spasm of coughing may be
greatly relieved by drinking a teaspoon
ful of glycerine in a wineglassfulof hot
milk.
Vaseline is one of the best applica
tions for the nails, and also for the
hands when they become chapped, as it
is extremely penetrating and healing. ..
To prevent the hands from being cal
loused while doing housework, wrap
soft cloths around the handles of the
broom, mop, carpet sweeper and iron
handles.
An aching head may be greatly relieved
by bathing it with hot .water and rubbing
afterwards with lemon juice until it
smarts. Rest for a short time and the
headache will gradually disappear.
If you are troubled with cold feet,
which is another evidence of poor circu
lation, raise yourself on your toes slow
ly, taking deep breaths as you do so,
about twenty times. Do this three or
four times a day until your circulation is
belter.
Persons with defective sight when
threading a needle with white thread
should hold it over something black, and
when threading with black thread should
hold it over something white. This also
applies to threading the machine needle.
The woman who wishes to look tall
should wear an extra heel in her boot or
shoe, and she will have her desire. It
is only a shaped piece of cork half an
inch high at the back and tapering down
to nothing. It is perfectly comfortable
to wear, and cannot in any way hurt the
foot.
Perspiring feet should be bathed every
night and morning In warm water.
Atfer drying, dust freely with a powicr
composed of thirty grains of salicylic
acid, one half onuce of oxide of zinc,
and one ounce of talcum. Wear very
thin stockings and change them daily.
A severe cold is often the result of ac!d
in the stomach, and may be relieved or
cured by taking twice or three times, at
intervals of several hours, one teaspoon
ful of bicarbonate of soda in a glass of
hot water. The effect is promptly felt,
us the soda acts as a stimulant and dis
infectant to the system.
An excellent eyebrow grower is made
by combining four ounces of alcohol with
two ounces of castor oil, and adding a
few drops of oil of bergamot. Apply
this to the eyebrows every night with a
tiny brush. A little massage with the
finger tips each night before going to
bed will aid materially the good work of
the! tonic.
One of the main causes of sleepless
ness is an over-abundance of blood in
the head. An excellent insomnia cure
is to place 1 a cloth wrung out in cold
water on the back of the neck and a hct
water bag at the feet, or the feet may be
placed in a pail of hot water before re
tiring, if this is preferred. The main
idea is to have the head cool and the feet
warm if perfect rest and sleep is de
sired.

class that even the Phoenicians were
the Inventors, by another tlmt. the
(Jrci.'ks and Romans bad a knowledge
of It. Such notliyis. however, have
been completely refuted,
One passage, nevertheless, of n re
markable character occurs In tbe works
of Cardinal dc Vitty. bishop of I'tole
nials. In Syria. lie went to Palestine
during the fourth crusade, about the
year 1120-1. He relumed afterward to
Europe and subsequently bad; to the
Holy Land, whore be wrote Ills work
entitled "Illstorla Orlentali's." as near
ly us can be determined, between the
years 1215 and 1220. In chapter 5)1
of that work he bus this singular pas
sage:
"The Iron needle! after contact with
the loadstone, constantly Minis to tbe
north star, wbicb. at tbe axl» vt tbe
firmament, remains Immovable while
tbe others revolve. «ud hence It is es
sentially necessary lo those nurignt-
Ing oil the nce.-iu."
Tbese words are tt» explicit as tbey
are extraordinary. Tbey state s» fact

before the birth of Gioiu. lv audition
to this fact! there is another equally
fatal to bis claim as tta»» original dis

It is now settled beyond a donbt
that tbe Chlnesr were ntti.ua Luted, with
tbe compass long before the Eizrope

sions to the magnetic needle lo the
traditionary period of Chinese history,
about 2.000 yeans before Christ, aud a
still more credible account of it is
found in tbe reign of Clringwangef tbe
Chow dynasty, before Christ 1114.
All this, however, may be granted
without It) Ibe least Impairing tlie just
claims of Gloia to the gratitude of man

the position of Gloia In relation, to the
compass was precisely tliat of Watt in

The compass used by tbe inarfuers
in tbe Mediterranean during tbe
twelfth and thirteenth centuries was
a very uncertain nnd unsatisfactory
apparatus. It consisted only of n mag
netic needle floating In a vnse or basin
by means of two straws on a bit of
cork supporting it on the surface of
tbe water.
The compass used by tbe Arabians
In the thirteenth century was an in
strument of exactly Hie same descrlp-
* t ion. Now, ihe inconvenience and in
efficiency of such an apparatus are ob
vious. The agitation of the ocean and
the tossing of tbe vessel might render
it useless in a moment.
Hut Gioia placed tbe magnetized
needle on a pivot, wbicb permits It to
turn to (ill sides with facility. After
ward It was attached ton card divided
into ihlrty-iwo points, (-oiled rose do

was suspendrd I" such a manner that,
however the vessel might be tossed,
it would always remain horizontal.—

EDENWAS AT NORTH tOLE
Will Become a Great Health Ilc-
sort, Dr. Seasholes Says
That the Garden of Eden was located
at the North Pole, And that the newly
discovered Arctic regions will be o
health resort of the future were two in
teresting assertions made last evening
by Rev. Dr. Charles L. Seasholes in a
sermon on "The Relation of the North
Pole to God's Power of Redemption,"
in the third Baptist church, German
town, Pa. Sin, he said, caused the
human family to be driven from this
paradise, and the genius of man has
now regained it. How it will be re
stored to its former ideal condition and
made into a new paradise Dr. Seasholes
did not explain. He said in part:
"The Garden of Eden was at the
North Pole. While some have endea
vored to locate it in the Mesopotamiaa
Valley, the island of Ceylon, at the
source of the Nile, and in the region
just north of the Himalayas, we agree
with Prof. Warren of Boston University
that it was the region around the pole,
for the following reasons:
"Considering the earth at one time a
heated molten mass, the portion to cool
first would be that around the poles,
and at these places vegetation would ap
pear, then animal life, then. man.
"The North Pole region was a para
dise in climate, neither too hot nor too
cold, the heavens beautiful with the
stars moving around the Polar star in
parallel planes. In early times there
was an abundance of plants and flowers
which now grow in the sub-tropics, and
many species ot animals now found in
warmer climes.
"The continents are unite* in the
North Polar reigpn, so that as. the race
increased in numbers it could move
down the. continents to the places, their
descendauts nov occupy. Many °E the
aborigine&of the north and south. Ameri
can contiaents hajie traditions that their
ancestors came fc»m the. north.
"Sin caused tha human family to tee
driven from, the North Pole, or Edea,
region. Sin. pushed the earth aslant and
gave it an inclinatii<au of 23 degrees, tQ' its
axis, which, brought to the northi polar
country intense cold and a six.-moaths
night. Thahuinan race was driven, out
by cold ar.tL dank.uess.
"The tres'of life is the north pole.
Electricity is. life, and the nimtlii pate
is an electric or magnetic center. It
will be to this, age what the pole with
the brazen, serpeut .was to the age af
Moses.
'The inttoances,, or leaves, of this
pole or tree of lite will be for Bie heal
ing of the. nations. To it will flock, the
nervous wrecks, aad consumptions,, and
it will be. the world's snitarium.. Ere
long that region, will be a citw o.£ aa
chored vessels,, and we shall spank ofi it
as "paradise regained."
Lightniug Hints
Between 700 and 800 Anertctns,
mostly/ formers, are killed by Lightning
every year, aad about twice that number
are injured. The zone of danger in a
thunder-storm is generaly equal to the
area of the cloud itself, but toe heaviest
bolts, nearly always occur simultaneous
ly with the passage of the storm front.
Within this zone aknost any upright
object, especially a tree,, is a better
conductor than the air itself, and there
fore is liable to a lightning stroke. It
is not well, for that reason, to take re
fuge under a tree when a storm comes
up. For the same reason the habit
which many timorous people have of
leaving their own windows and huddling
by the fire place is a bad one, as the
chimenys attracts the all-dreaded
thunderstorm.
It is poor policy to frequent wiro
fences when rain overtakes you in the
fields, for, if the fence is not properly
made, the lightning may convert its
strands into something like live wires
and run along them for considerable dis
tances, instead of plunging straight into
the earth. The proper way to construct
a wire fence, as the farmers' journals
will tell you, is to ground it with a
pices of galvanized wire ever fifth post.
The government farmers' bulletin, on
which we base most of these statements,
rather rashly remarks that if one's pro
perty "is insured against loss by \ light
ning, there would .be little incentive
towards incurring additional expense
for lightning conductors. " We amend
so as to read "commercial incentive."
No insurance can suffice to bring a
shocked housewife back to life, or even
to give her a feeling of personal security
when storms arc brewing.
If one does put up lightning rods on
his house, the main thing is to have
their ends grounded in moist earth at
whatever depth the latter is found.
Houses equipped with tin roofs and
down waterspouts are pretty well pro
tected from lightning, if the spouts
reach the ground or have wire con
nection therewith. Water pipes in the
house may well be connected directly
with the lightning rods, but better keep
the latter as far as possible from the gas
pipes.- From the New York Mail.
Frightful Fate Averted
"I would have been a cripple for life,
from a terrible cut on my knee cap,
"writes Frank Disberry, Kelliher,
Minn, without Bucklen's Arnica salve,
which soon cured me." Infallible for
wounds, cuts bruises, it soon cures
burns, scalds, old sores, boils, skin
eruptions. World's best for Piles.

Why Colds are Dangerous.
Because you have contracted ordinary
colds and recovered from them without
treatment of any kind, do not for a
moment imagine that colds are not
dangerous. Everyone knows that
pneumonia and chronic catarrh have
their origin In a common cold. Con
sumption is not caused by a cold but
the cold prepares the system for the
reception ana development of the germs
that would not otherwise have found
lodgment. It is the same with all in
fectious diseases. Diphtheria, scarlet
fever, measles and whooping cough arc
much more likely to be contracted when
the child has a cold. You will see
from this that more real danger lurks in
a cold than in any other of the common
ailments. The easiest and quickest way
to cure a cold is to take Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy. The many remarkable
cures effected by this preparation have
made it a staple article of trade over a
large part of the world. For sale by

TALL AFRICAN GRASS.
Beautiful Scenes at Night on the Veldt
When Fire Spreads.
Unlike a good deal of South Africa.
Rhodesia Is largely wooded. In some
places the forests are of value, but n
large proportion Is not valued for Its
timber. The grass in this part of
Africa grows to a phenomenal height
In the valleys.- and especially in the
valleys of the Sabl and Zambezi rivers
It reaches its greatest height. To say
that the grass is often twelve feet high
la no exaggeration. Naturally It Is
very ensy to lose one's way In this
grass if one Is unfortunate enough to
stray from the beaten track. It Is the
custom there to burn tills grass off
each year when It gets dry. This Is
usually in August nnd September or
even In October. Fires burn for miles,
and as the country Is largely a wilder
ness little damage Is done by this
method of destroying the grass. It is
a beautiful sight at night In the fire
season to see the hills for miles around
encircled with flames. ■
After the jirass has been burned the
rnlny season usually begins, and it Is
then that the country is nt Its prettiest.
The grass Is then green, nnd the foli
age on the trees is beautiful. The old
leaves drop off gradually, and tho new
ones take their place before the trees
are bare. The uew leaves are of all
shades of the rainbow, and it is much
like the fall scenery in this country
when the dead leaves are falling from
rhe trees. Waterfalls are numerous in
the mountains, and there are many of
great height, although tlie rivers are
usually small in volume.— Springfield

Fertilizer— Pussy's Overlooked Sense
—An Explosion Laboratory— Too Much
of a Good Thing— Disease-Killing
Paint.
Among the believers in the Inlluence
of atmospheric electricity on vegetation
is Prof. Lemstroem, of the Uunivcrsity
of Helsingfors, Finland. He finds that
plants in the polar regions escaping
night frosts have a much more rapid
and luxuriant growth than those in
warmer climates, and that, despite
primitive cultivation with wooden plows
and hai rows great crops are yielded by
rye, barley and oats. The rapid growth
is usually attributed to the continuous
daylight of two or three summer months.
This explanation is unsatisfactory, and
it has been proven that, even in these
months, the aggregate of Jheat and light
is less than L at (5 deg. of latitude or
farther south. Various facts have con
vinced Prof. Lemstroem that Arctic
vegetation is stimulated by the electri
cal currents— so often manifested in the
aurora borealis — that flow between the
earth and the atmosphere in the north.
In the annual rings of conifers he has
found variations showing extra growth
in years and latitudes of great electrical
activity, and in experiments with a
Holtz electrical machine he has hastened
the growth of barley, wheat and rye by
an artificially charged atmosphere. The
theory suggests an explanation of the
pointed leaves of conifers a:id barbed
ears of grain, which conduct the electric

At sea-level atmospheric pressure is
balanced by a column of pure water 33.8
feet high, and it has seemed impossible
to raise water to a greater height 1 by a
suction pump. Yet pump operator Alzia!,
on a French warship, has accomplished
the fact of drawing up water from a
vessel's hold to a height of 50 feet.
One end of a smill bent tube was pissed
into the bottom of the pipe attached, to
the pump, the other end projecting
above the water in the hold, and the
working pump drew air through this
tube forming an emulsion of air,ar.d
water, which, having less density iharl
water, could be raised to a grtater
height by pressure of the atmosphere.
A mixture of pitch and wax. used by
European organmakers as a glue substi
tute that resists dampness, is effective.
Resinit, a new product, is described
by H. Lebaelt, a German, as similar
to glass celluloid and hard rubber, but
superior to these and other substances
for many uses. It seems to be adapted
to a great variety of purposes. It differs
from shellac and other natural resins,
as well as from various artificial resins
prepared from phenols and aldehjdes, in
being slow-burning, infusible, in
soluble, and unaffected by acids and
alkalies. A mixture of crystallized car
bolic acid and a 400 perc ent solution of
formaldehyde is heated with potash,
soda, or other alkali or neutral salt.
The product is a yellowish, mobile
liquid, which is an impure resinit with
much water, and is adapted for impreg
nating porous substances, like wood and
paper, to render them hard and water
proof. 'Distilling off the water leaves a
viscous liquid, of many possible appli
cations, When the thick liquid is
heated for a certain time to 17G deg. F.
and then to about 40 deg., it is changed
to a glossy vitreous solid, which is pure
resinit, —red, brown or yellow in color,
transparent or translucent and having a
conchoidal fracture. It can be dyed, and
cut, turned, and polished. Its great
hardness and slight brittleness are un
fitted for some purposes, but a more
elastic and easily worked material can
be had by simply mixing the pure resi
nit wiht kieselguhr, talcum or other
filler.
One of the recent surprising dis
coveries is that of the important in
fluence of manganese on . plant growth.
At the Congress of Applied Chemistry
in London, Gabriel Bertrand stated that
the action varies with different soils,
but in the' most favorable cases may
cause an increase of 400 per cent in the
crop. He prefers the sulphate, at the
rate of about 00 pounds to the acre. He
believes that the effect is entirely cataly
tic, the manganese salt undergoing no
i haugc, and suggests that the salts of
boron, iodine and zinc will have like
effect. All kinds of plants seem to be
affected.
A hitherto undetected sense organ in
the domestic cat has been discovered by
F. Fritz. It consists of a few long,
stiff bristles, or feelers, connected
with the numerous nerves near the wrist
joint of the fore leg, und was already
known in rodents, and other animals
that hold food with their forepaws, or
crawl and climb. This organ seems to be
lacking in apes and monkeys, as also,
very curiously, in the dog.
A special coal-dust experiment station
is used by the Vienna Committee on
Fire-Damp for studying mine ex
plosions. A masonry gallery 064 feet
long has an arched roof about 7 feet
high, increasing slightly in height to
ward the outer end, and is covered with
earth varying in depth from Q}4 feet at
the outer end end to 70 feet over the
explosion chamber. This chamber,
forming the inner end of the gallery is
of concrete, 0 feet high, G, l^ feet iong,
and 4?<2 feet wide. Racks of shelves for
coal-dust are placed at intervals along
the gallery, and apparatus is provided
for testing measures of preventing and
limiting explosions, such as wet zones,
water sprays, and zones of stone dust.
The flame produced by an explosion is
measured by matches placed along the
gallery at intervals of 40 inches. Loosely
corked bottles, flljed with water, are
suspended bottom up about 35 feet from
the explosion chamber., and strings at
tached to the nearest shelves draw the
corks when the shelves are moved by an
explosion. In this way the bottles arc
emptied of water, samples of gas from
the explosion taking its place, ready for
chemical and other examination.
Even sun-baths are a cure-all to be used
with discretion and reasonable moder
ation. In some parts of Cermany,
specially near Berlin, it has bcome the
habit of men of all ages to lie naked in
the sun on the banks of a river for hours
at a time, occasionally entering the
water, and often continuing the practice
daily. The advocates of this "nature
treatment" have acquired quite fanatical
viws of its efficacy. Professor Grawlitz
has found, however, that its effects may
be decidedly harmful, and that it not
only yields painful sunburn, but may
result in serious irrgularity of the
heart and nervous derangement. Heal
thy children, in the habit of playing
hours daily on the sea shore, often
acquire the same nervous irritability
from excess of sunlight.

SEEING UNDER WATER.
Th* Refraction of Light and tha Lim-
iting Anglo of Vision.
One of tlie most peculiar things in
connection with life under wnter Is
what is known as the limiting angle of
vision. This iipplies to fishes, divers,
pubinarlne crewa and, In fact, nny be
ing possessing tlio power of sight and
desiring to look through the water at
objects In the air. Tlie effect Is not
due to a defect In vision, but to the re
fraction or bending of light, ninl no
telescope or other optical instrument
can get n round It.
The effect consists of tlie Impossibil
ity of seeing anything on the outside
unless the observer directs his line of
sight within forty-eight degrees of the
vertical. If a forty-nine degree angle or
over Is tnkeu. the surface', no mutter
how clear the water Is. nets ns n per
fect mirror and reflects objects nt tlie
bottom of the wnter, thus not allowing
anything on the outside- to be t;ecn.
The consequence of this property Is
the most startling of nil, for everything
oil the outside can be seen nnd thus
has to be seen In the cone described
by the forty-eight. -J^gree angle from
the eye. This nh««o.i nil outside ob
jects huddled together and appearing
bigh In air. Thus, if one dives into tlie
middle of a wide river, on looking up
the banks will appear close together,
but. at a great distance from the ob
server, high In air.
This angle is culled the "critical" au
gle and of course varies with the two
media In contact.
If one desires to make the experiment
a square glass bos or an aquarium will
answer very well. Suspend this from
the ceiling or support it on a wall
bracket and look under it at an angle.
The phenomenon will be observed as
Indicated. The clearer the water and
the stronger the light the more clearly
will things appear.— Chicago Record-
Herald.

In Jail Again.
Charles Forbes is again in trouble.
September 10, 1903 he began serving a
IK) days sentence, meted out by Recorder
Thompson for being drunk. While at
work for the city on November 14th he
left; in fact it would seem that an op
portunity had been given him to leave.
He cannot stay away from lackson for
any length of time and returned a year
and a half thereafter and was again
jailed to complete that sentence. On
August 12th last he was released, and
immediately left town. Where he has
been since then no one but himself
knows except that for the past few
weeks he has been herding turkeys on
the Rader ranch. Upon being paid off
he repaired to the old Kerr station on
the lone road, kept by Ja-.ies fclus.
During last Tuesday night lie got
"loaded" and with a desire for des
truction he commenced turning over
the tables, chairs and broke some
windows and furniture— mads "romjli
house" as it were. In this he may
have had help, but at any rate constable
Laverone was telephoned for and went
down and brought Forbes before justice
Goldner where a charge of misdemeanor
was placed against him. He plead not
guilty and bonds were fixed at i? 300.
He had no recourse but to go to jail
pending an examination.
Gold Gravel for Stockton
W. E. Stswart, who is in charge of
the mining operations at the Butte Basin
gravel claim, has taken out a ton or
more of gravel from that claim which he
vtill ship to Stockton. During the
celebration of the Rush of '40 he will
be there in person and give exhibitions
of the process of panning out gold in
the pioneer times. The hoisting engine
employed at the claim broke down last
week, and had to be shipped to San
Francisco for repairs.
