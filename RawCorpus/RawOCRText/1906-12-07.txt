The beginnings of life have been
lately studied by Miss Kina Monti iv
some ot the newer lakes ot the Alps.
In the Lakes of the Sercas, which has
been formed within tbe memory ot
present inhabitants, only live species
of life are to be found, aud these nre
all plants, four being diatoms. In
Oug and Tiguaga, two older lakes,
animal forms— feeding upon the dia
toma— have begun to appear. Tbe
observations make it evident tbat
life iv a lake begina with diatoms
tbat absorb the carbonic acid dis
solved in tho water, and that t.ho nest
stage is the development of simple an
imal organisms, like rhizopods, that
subsist on vegetable forms already
existing. Geologists have inferred
tbat tbe Urst life on earth began in
tbe ocean in this same way.
A nowlv-suggested test of death
claimed to bo infallible — depeud=
upon the alleged fact that hydrogen
sulphide always forms in the lungs
within twelve to twenty-four hours
after death, and finds its way out of
the body through the air passages.
The presence of tbe gas is determined
by placing id tbe nostril ct the sup
posed corpse a piece of absorbent
paper moistened with a solution ot
lead acetate. The paper is blackened
by any trace of the gas, but remains
unchanged if lite still lingers in tbe
body.
The new fly of East Africa, describ
ed by W. Donitz as Cordylobia mu
rium, was discovered by Dr. Kobert
Koch as parasites in the skin of rats
suspected of plague. Flies batched
trom the maggots in just one month.
it is supposed that tbe eggs are laid
in the earth, and tbat tbe larvae at
tach themselves to tbe parts of the
rats touching tbe ground. Larvae of
another fly of the same germ are
found in boils of railroad builders in
Guinea.
. the new gilding boat made in fails
b by Levavasseur and Leip consist es-
s sentially of a light, pointed train sec
ttion, wliiuh is connected by a light
w wood platform two feet long to a larfje
f float tail thirty feet long. The - lor-
w ward section contains the motor, from
v vvbicb a shaft runs. to the propeller
i iq the tail. - The rear end ot the tail
i ia almost" submerged, while the' for-
w ward etui ami the main boat float on
t the surface, and are almost lifted out
o of the water by the action of the pro-
p peller. The new tifty horse power
e eight-cylinder Antoinette motor is
u used. In calm .veather the new form
o ot boat elides very rapidly on the sur
fface of tbe water, and in rough water
—this being the special aa vantage
c claimed over sliding and ordinary
b boats— it is able to run at fair epeed..
T The artificial cork of a recent French
patent is made of a mixture of amor
phous cellulose (pith ot rushes, pow
dered cocoanut shells or paper pulp),
fibrous cellulose (thistle down, tex
tiles or esparto pulp) and agglutiuat
ing cellulose (solution ot nitro-oellu
lose.) Glass-lined moulds wito small
holes for the escape of vapors are ased
!o shape the pasty composition. Tlie
volatile solvents of the nitrocellulose
are evaporated, the corks are removed
from thejmoulds, and the uitro-cellu
lo3e is denitrated by a reducing
agent. The finished material is given
resistance to water by dipping into
tungstic acid.
Tuberculous patients that live and
grow tat are reported byDr Guilhaud,
a French physician. He has found a
form of tuberculosis that rernuiusju
the condition t)f a local leisou, is usu
ally aesociated with an excessive de
posit of adipose tissue and is curable.
He believes it arises from implanting
attenuated Koch bacilli in so-called
scrofulous persons.
While tbe average man is satisfied
with a maximum of 32 teetb, a Turk

Acetylene is now carefully purified,
washed aud dried, and stored in cyl
inders in dissolved form, safety iv us
ing the compressed gas being thus en
sured. Cylinders ot any desired size
are tilled wth such absorbent as asbes
tos or a special charcoal cement, mak
ing expolsion iv the cylinder impos
sible, and the porous material is then
soaked with a fixed quantity ot ace
tone, a volatile organic liquid having
the peculiar property of ab3or6iug
twenty-live times its own volume of
acetylene at atmospheric pressure and
60 deg. P., aud a greater proportion
at increased pressure, in practice,
the acetone is so regulated in quan
tity that the. cylinders contain ten
times their own volume ot acetylone
for every atmosphere ot pressure. The
compression being ten atmosphere.-,
the cylinder contains 100 times their
own volume of acetylene or ten time?
more thau when tho undissclvcd gas
is compressed in the ordinary way.

This Mediterranean of the west is

who live under republican forms of

The Girls' School
At Whittier.
A State Institution that has not
Made Good.
Arthur J. Pillsbury
if California had just the right
kind of a state school for the educa
tion and reformation of stubborn and
wayward girJs it is not impossible
that it would now bave enrolled as
many as three hundred pupils. It is
nofr improbabe tbat there are as many
as that in tho state who need to
attend such a school. On the oocasion
of my recent visit to the girls' de
partment of the state school at
Whittier there wero thirty-seven
girls in attendance, and iv my opinion
tbat was ton many.
liv present management ot the
girls' school at Whittier is not especi
ally and preeminently to be blamed
for conditions that exist, oi for the
general want of confidence which tbe
courts, tbe officers aud the people
entertain for tho school. The school
never got off right toot foremost, and
it may be doubted if there has ever
been a period in it 3 history when it
rose tully to the requirements of such
a school.
A True Bill Found.
No other indictment needs to be
died against tbe school than (hat
true bill made out by tbe following
record ot the terms of seivice of the
twelve principals ot the school, the
women who have bad the welfare of
the pupils in their immediate charges :
Chloe it. Jones, May 27, 1891, to
May 20, 1892.
Alra S. A. Moore, May 20, 1892, to
November 1, 1892.
Miss Minnie King, Nov. 1, 1892 to
December 1, 1892.
Miss Jessie DeWolte, Dec. 1, 1892. to
January 8, 1895,
Miss Vesta A. Olmstoad, Jau. ti,
1895, to September 1, lbiW,
Ellen J. Wilson, Sept. 1, 1890, to
Nov. 11, 1896.
Mrs M. X Tnrelkeld, Nov. 1896, to
bfebruarj 1, 1398.
Miss Mary.O'Hara, Feb. 1, 1898, to
June 1, 1901.
Mrs M. L. Daria, June 9, 1901, to
October 15, 1902.
Miss Jennie Wall, Nov. 1, 1902 to
January 18, 1900,
Mrs tiva Flounders, January 19,
190(i, to April 1, lUO6.
Mrs .Lottie G. Sinnard, April 1,
1906, to October 13, 1906.
The thirteenth principal, iv a littlo
more than fifteen aud oue-half years,
was installed November Ist of this
year and 1 have not her name.
Reformation a Liife Work.
The fitness or uulitness of these
twelve women to perform the services
tor whiob they were employod is not
here in Issue. I have not the re
quisite knowledge ot the tacts in each
case to warrant the bestowal of praise
or blame, but I do affirm tbat there
should have been no such history ot
rotation in the office of principal ot
the giils' school at Whittier. There
is nothing and can be nothing worth
while iv such a school without con
inuity of management.
The work of formation or re-forma
:ion of character is a lite work, and
especially is this true of tbe reforma
tion of wayward girls. It should be
entered upon by a woman, mature in
years, iv full command of herself,
yet with an open and growing mind,
who undertakes the work as a devoted
service and not as a job. A woman
lit to be principal of such a school is
worthy ot a generous salary, not a
measley ?70 per month, while there
are two men in tbe institution draw
ing ¥250 eaob per month — none too
much either— enough to enable the
devoted wqrker to provide for her
wants when her work shall have worn
her out, as it inevitably will in 15 or
20 years. 1 should say SIBOO a year,
and found, for tbe woman big enough
to till the position.
One Will Supreme.
Given the right woman for tbe
place, her will, in tbe management of
the school, should be supreme. Not
even her board of trustees should
venture to interfere in tbe manage
ment of the school or do moie than
to advise and aid and so control tbe
purse Blrings that tbe institution may
not get into financial deep water.
And especially there .should be no
wife of tbe superintendent of the
boys' department holding a per
fuDctory position of superintendent
over the principal of the girls' school,
but without any real responsibility
or burdensome duty to perform.
Happily that condition does not cow
exist at Whittier.
The work of reformation ot crooked
human characters is one that must
be grown into. An apprenticeship. in
a well ordered institution euguged in
similar work would prove heiptul,
but it cuuuot make up for the want
of the requisite personality. On
tbe other band, the requisite per
sonality can make up for tbe want ot
a previoue institution training.
it was up to tbe several boards ot
trustees, and the superintendents of
tbe larger institution, to rind tbe
rigbl woman for the place of superin
tendent, or principal, of the girls'
school at Whittier, and then keep her
until she is wore out. Either they
have not found tho right woman, or
they bave not kept ber when they
have found ber, and a substantial
failure has been scored.
Divorce a Vinculo.
Two years ago 1 became convinced
tbat the state of California should
oither go out of the girls' reformation
business or divorce the girls' depart
ment from, the hoys' at Whittier
state school, and establish a new in
stitution at some other place.
The entire farm and equipment at
Whittier are needed fcr the delin
quent boyhood of California under
sixteen years of age, or will be needed
until the several counties and cities
of the state have awakened to a realiz
ation of the value of truant schools
for preventing |boys from beooming
delinquent. A more thorough segre
gation and classification ot Whittier
boys are needed than can be had
under existing conditions.
The work of reforming a wrong
headed girl is so different from that
of a boy that it is asking too much of
one management that it shall perform
both functions.
I submit to the people of Cali
fornia that an experiment that has
been conducted for fifteen years with
out furnishing satisfactory results has
been conducted long enough. It is
time to try something else.
The Failure Not Total.
Those who have thoughtfully mea
sured Whittier school for girls have
found it wanting, but this is not say
ing that its failure is total, or that it
has done no good. Many girls have
gone out from Whittier to behave
themselves reputably thereafter, just
as more thnn half the prisoners sent
to that schocl-for-crime known as
San Quentin prison go out from there
never to be beard from, criminally,
tberafter. One jolt was enough for
him.
All the Whittier school girls want
to go home. They can go home
within a leasonabie time if they be
have themselves, and in many cases,
perhaps most, tbat condition prece
dent is sufficient. They have felt tbe
hand of the law upon the shoulder,
and have not liked tbe grip of it. It
brings them to their senses, but" that
works no radical reformation in the
character ot the pupil and does not
send the pupil out much better
equipped to battle with the forces of
evil. Tbe stain of committment is
inflicted without supplying the com
pensating washing out of tbat stain
by work mete for repentance. Thoy
are made sorry for ' the punishment
rather than for the sin.
The Limitation of the School.
The faults 1 find with tne Whittier
School for girls are, in the main, as
follows:
1. There la no proper segregation
of tbe morally perverted form the
merely wayward, the unchaste from
the stubborn, tbe leader from the
led, tbe younger from the older and
more hardened Tbe buildings are
there for it, but there ia in the
management no realizing sense of the
importance of such segregation and
classification.
2. There isj rro adequate industrial
training and trades teaohing. There
are cooking and sewing to be sure,
but no cooking or sewing schools,
nothing making au unremitting de
mand upon the half dormant intel
lectual life of tbe pupil. There
should be, and could be, if tbe
necessity were keenly felt, schools
for oooking, sewing, dressmaking
and uiiliuery, and to this end the law
should not only permit articles to be
made fur all tbe women on tbe
ground, but for outside custom so
tar as necessary for a full training in
doing real things.
3. There is little in the way of
instruction in those accomplishments
wbicb mean so much in the life of
every girl' and which contribute so
much toward establishing in ber mind
a beathful self-respect, always funda
mental in developing a robust moral
character.
4. 1 have upon my visits to this

Product of Broken Homes.
The tbr.ty-seven girls at Whittier
state school are not essentially
different from outside girls. Tbree
fourths cf them are trom broken
homes and are untrained, undis
ciplined, vi t.ii gbt and ansateguard

when youth is a perpetual intoxica
tion, and tbo age of discretion has
not yet danued. Inasmuch as tbe
couits, at'd tho lenient divorce laws
of California are going on breaking
homes at tbe rate ot some 2,000 a
year, the stnto owes it to itself to do
something better worth while lor tbe
salvage (it the flotsam and jetsam of
domestic storm and stress than has
heretofore been done at the girls'
school at Wbittier.
My voice is for a separate state

SAN FRANCISCO LETTER.
San Franoisco, November 28":— San
Francisco is tbe city tbat is. and is
no longer tbe city tbat was. San
Francisco has found herself, despite
tbe croaking 3of those who looked
upon her ruins and predicted evil
and despair. When the disaster came
to San Francisco it carried away
many of her buildings, but ber people
were left, and ot those who went
anay during those days when chaos
reigned, all have come back who can
Qnd place to stay, and fifty thousand
more are waiting to get in. On every
hand residences, cottages, fiats and
apartment houses are going up as
rapidly as forty thousand skilled
artisans can put material together.
Helping these skilled men in tbe
building trades are fifteen thousand
other men removing debris, hauling
material, building street railways,
laying gas and water mains, stringing
electrio wires, and doing tbe thou
sand and one things tbat must be
done to bring San Franoisco back to
her own.
Tbe old atmosphere of San Fran
cisco is here, and when one gets away
from the burned district into that
part of tbe city which has been chang
ed from the residence portion to a
new business section, he finds tbe
same gaiety, the same care-tree happy
people, who made San Francisco nbat
it was before the Ore— tbe best place
to live in oi tbe face of tbe eirtb.
Kstimates of tr<e population change
every day, and they range from tbe
most pessimistic of 325,000 to tbat of
the most optimistic, 400,000. It is
sate to say that the latter figure is
not far from tbe mark.
If one desire to learn 'what is being
done toward providing homes in San
Francisco let him go over toward
North lieacb, between Russian Bill
and Telegraph Hill. There you will
see that the sides of both bills, from
tbe valley between clear to the top.
are covered with new buildings .that
are housing thousands who were
driven away by tbe fire. Just bow
many houses have been built one may
not dare venture even an estimate,
foi they are going np so rapidly tbat
today's estimate would be wrong to
morrow. Down in tbe business dis
trict, where everything was wiped
out, each week now sees changes tbat
indicate the fulfillment of tbe pre
diction made in these letters several
mouths ago— that the world would be
astonished at tbe rapidity of the re
construction and rehabilitation of
San Franoisco. Hundreds of brick,
and stone, and reinforced concrete
buildings have been finished and
are occupied by business firms_ who
are doing more business than they
ever did before tbe tire. These build
ings are being completed with a rapid
ity tbat is astonishing even to the
San Franciscan who is accustomed to
taring things done in a hurry.
It is said of San Francisoo tbat a
city of sbaoks is going up. It should
Five Cents Per Copy.
be remembered that two cities are
being built at tbe same time; one a
city to live and do bnsiness in while
the other, permanent, is in the build
ing. All over the city these shacks
are to be found, but it is evident
that they will remain but a shoit
time, for the permanent structures
are encroaching npon them day by
day, and as the good buildings go up
the poor ones come down." Since the
latter part of May, when the board
of works renewed the issuance- of
building permits, there have been
permits to the valoe of 132,000,000
already issued, and in reconstruction
work nearly 860,000,000 have been
spent. This means that something is
doing in the city that is.
Of fifty-seven miles of streets that
were rendered impassable forty miles
have been cleaied, aDd the "remaining
seventeen are streetsin those parts of
tbe city which are little used fop
traffic. Seventy-five per cent of the
streetcar lines are in active opera
tion, and the rest are being rehabili
tated^ rapidly as men can do it.
While traffic of the' 3treets has been
resumed nearly all 'over the city, even,
tbe sidewalks in the down town dis
trict have been replaced on a majority
of tbe streets.
The garish decoration of- strange
restaurants may not be co prominent
a feature in those haunts where
strangers were taken around China
town, and on tbe fringe of the Barbary
Coast, or up on Telegraph hill, but
many of the old restaurants are back
on the former location, with just as
good meals, and serving the same
strange dishes. The "atmosphere"
of which artists and Bohemians rave
will bo back long before tbe city is
entirely rebuilt, for climate, location
and people bave remained, and it is
a combination of these tbat make the
genuine San Francisco "atmosphere."

President's Message.
President Koosevelt's messatce to
oongress is one of the most torceful
and remarkable documents ever pre
sented to tbe national legislature. In
every paragraph it reveals the sterling
character of tbe man behind it. It is
clear and positive in iU tone, and
advocates in several directions radical
departures from the policy of tbe
past. Whatever difference <if opinion
may exist as to tbe wisdom ot some
ot the recommendations, no one will
doubt for a moment the high patriotic
and unselHah motives ot tbe president
in their advocacy. The^document is
a lengthy one and deals with a great
variety of subjects, bearing npon our
domestic and foreign relation. Among
tbe prominent features ot tbe message
we may mention tbe following:
The exclusion of the Japanese from
the oommon schools of San Kranoisco
is denouuoaii as wicked and absurd.
The naturalization of Japanese is
advooated.
Government should not part witb
any more public coal lands.
Employers' liability aut to be ex
tended.
tiigbt hours a day to be tbe limit
on railroads, aud a ganeral adoption
of the eight hour day.
Free trade for the Philippines, or
a sweeping reduction of the tariff
charges.
Marriage and divorce laws to be
under tbe control of Congress.
Anti-chila labor laws tor tbe terri
tories and District of Columbia.
inheritance and graded income tax
laws.
Fall citizenship for the Porto
Klcans.
Enactment of ship subsidy laws.
One llrst class battleship to be
added to tbe navy each year.
The right of injunction by the
courts should not be impaired.
Keform in the army aud navy,
abolishing tbe system of promotion on
tbe ground of seniority.
THE PABTT ALL BIGHT.
The L«dger takes no stock in tbe
gloomy predictions that tbe repub
licans of .Amador county stand little
show to sleet any candidate for a
county office for many years. Snon
propb.iies have only tbe disappoint-
Ed hopes of a few disgruntled ones to
rest upon. If it is simply meant that
If tbe party is to be guided in tbe
future id the same devious paths that
marked the late campaign, tbe pros
pects of 8000688 will again be du
bious, we are willing to concede the
correctness of tbe proposition. Like
causes produces like effects. Id oar
opinion, the party bore up remark
ably well under the adverse condi
tions to which it waa subjected. A
ticket composed of good material was
slaughtered, it is true, but that de
feat [was brought about by voidable
methods. Let cs in the future steer
dear of tbe ways tbat were frowned
down Id crashing defeat last month.
Let us I.am the lesson thoroughly
tbat to be successful we must, first of
all, deserve success. The vitally im
portant.lesson ia that those in leader
ship most be tbe most abject follow
ers. Dictation of any kind will not
go witb republicans. At every point
of the game let them keep step to the
wishes! of tbe rank and file. They
must remember tbat they are merely
servants, not masters. To twist tbe
organization to down this one, or to
raise op tbe other one. is not wise.
Authority Is Dot to be made a club tn
emphasize the likes or dislikes of the
wieldera.
Japanese in School.
Tbe action of the authorities in San
Francisco not to permit the Jap
anese to mingle in the schools with
tbe white children, has oieated a
tremendous Harry in diplomatic
circles, in both countries. A very
delicate question has thereby been
raised, which threatens to materially
atfeot the cordial relations heretofore
existing between the two nations.
The exclusion of Japanese, whether
adults or children, from the public
schools, is in conformity witb tbe
universal -sentiment of American
citizens on the coast. It is more than
probable that it is also opposed to
tbe universal sentiment of the people
of th. Japanese empire. There is no
poastbility of reconciling tbe views of
tbe one class with tbe other. In
California the presence of the Jap
anese with white children in tbe
schools would no be tolerated, any
more than Chinese children. And
yet the United States is under treaty
obligations to give to subjects of
Japan in America all tbe rights and
privileges of tbe most favored nation.
For chapped and cracked hands
nothing is quite as good as an appli
cation of De Witt's Witob Hazel Salve.
Pat it on before going to bed, use
an old pair of gloves, and see what a
difference the morning will bring.

JAPANESE QUESTION TO THE FOEE
It is safe to say that the position
taken by President Roosevelt on tbe
Japanese question in his message, will
stir the people of tbe Pacific slope
states as they have not been stirred
since tbe civil war. The same argu
ments were urged in behalf ot tbe ad
mission of Chinese tc ail tbe privileges
aocoided other races some twenty tUt
years ago that are now brought forth
in- behalf of the Japanese. It required
many years to oduoate the eastern
and middle western states to the ex
clusion of Mongolians. The same
light is now on with regard to the
Japanese. Let it be admitted thai
the Japanese are the most enlightened
and progressive of Oiiental nations,
ihey are valiant in war, and equally
successful in tbe arts of peace. They
have fairly earned the right to be
classed witb the most cultured and
progressive nf nations. All this is
not seriously disputed. But that does
not reach tbe core of the question.
There is a deep-rooted prejudice in
tbe minds of American citizens to
any influx ot Asiatics to these shores
This feeling is not a mere sentimental
une to the dwellers of tbe Pacilic
coast. It is based on experience.
We have boen brought in 'contact
with tbe Mongolians, and we do not
want them as fellow citizens, or com
panious iv any way. Other sections
of the Union having no experience
in this direction, have not this pre
judice, and would force an undesii
able population upon us. If they
understood the matter as we under
stand it, they would feel exactly as
we do, and want to shut them out
precisely as we do. If the conditions
were reversed, and Japan were
threatened with an invasion of
Causasiajas to such an extent as to
disturb tbe labor market and the
educational system of that nation,
would there not be some steps taken
in that country to ward off the
danger. Of course there is no danger
from this sourse. The higher paid
laborers are not going to immigrate
in any formidable numbers to a
country were a far-lower wage
schedule exists.
That the little brown men and tbeir
children are accorded free education
in separate schools should be suffi
cient. This ought not to wound the
sensibilities of tbe Japanese. Tbe
same discrimination is lesorted to
toward tbe colored race in the south
ern states. They are not permitted
to ride in the same car with white
folks in some states. Why, insist
that tbe people of California shall
assooiate witb Japanese as with their
own race. The truth is they will not
do so, no matter what the treaty
obligations demand, or the interpre
tation placed therein by the president
or by congress. Japanese ways are
not our ways. They are of different
mental, moral and physical make-up.
We cannot assimilate witb them, aud
would not if we could. Neither can
ther assimilate with American ways.
The trade we have witb Japan is not
worthy of mention as an offset to tbe
admission of Japanese as citizens, or
on terms uf social equality. Far
better that we sell not a dollar's worth
of goods to these island people than
throw tbe gates wide open for their
entrance. On this issue the opponents
ot Japanese citizenship or admission
to this country are standing for tbe
true interests ot the United States.
We have too mucb mixture of races
here already. We have tried to
absorb the hordes not only from
Europe, but from Africa aud Asia,
and the experiment has proved a flat
failure. We realize this, if President
Roosevelt does not. Strict exclusion
of the Japanese, as well as other
Asiatics is the only path of national
protection and safety.

AZTEC ARCHITECTURE.
Wonderful Endurance of the Old
Mexican Buildinga.
The Mexicans or th;? Aztec Indians
can give the people of the United
States lessons in architecture and In
solid construction of buildings. There
are buildings standing today hi the
City of Mexico that have stood for
three centuries and are in an excellent
state of preservation. There is not a
frame building in the city. There are
a few adobe, but most all are stone,
brick or cement. There is a brick
building down in the old part of the
town that was erected prior to 1150.
It shows that so long ago as that the
Indians were experts in the manufac
ture of bricks. Hut probably 80 per
cent of all the buildings are made of
concrete cement. Cement and concrete
have been used successfully in Mexico
for 500 years, and all the cathedrals
and churches are of that material. On
the line of the Vera Cruz Pacific can
be seen the ruins of Toro Bravo, where
there are evidences of a city ruined
centuries ago. There are some twenty
pyramids of solid cement which must
have been erected over 500 years ago.
One of these pyramids is 170 feet in
height, and on the summit rests a
cement ledge thirty feet in diameter.
This, as well as others, Is of filigree
work and carved statuary.
Near this stands another of white
limestone, built in four terraces, witb
carvings aud ornameutatioas which
would put to shame the modern Amer
ican sculptor. It has stood all these
centuries, yet the limestone is much
easier broken thai) the cement. Think
of a town of almost 400,000 persons,
and the fire record is three in one year.
The inside walls of many of the build
ings are as much as six feet through,
and all buildings are built around
courts. There Is no provision in any
of them for fires, ami at the present
time small coal oil stoves arc selling
in the city for $20— the same that sell
for $3 in the states. The floors are of
stone, the collinga of filigree cement,
the walls of coarse plaster and almost
without exception band painted. The
architecture on many buildings In the
republic shows that the Indian of cen
turies ago was ahead of the modern
builder of today. — Hobart News-Re
publican.
Elasticity of Spiders' Webs.
Did you ever watch a spider's web
on a windy day? If so, you will notice
how wonderfully it accommodates
itself to the swaying of the twigs to
which it is attached. It is in fact elas
tic of the very finest quality, Were it
not for its elasticity the poor spider
would not long survive. The first
breeze would rend the silken meshes
of the web to atoms aud the owner's
stock of new materal would very soon
be exhausted in repairs and renewals.
Besides its elasticity, tbe spider's web
Is very sticky, a property which ac
counts for the e:ise wherewith it holds
insects when oneo ouuglit.

Whiskey Men's Troubles,
Au internal revenue otilcer was in
Jackson recently, to ascertain if
possible whether the stiiagent regula
tions ot Uncle Sam in the matter oi
llqnur dealing were being violated in
any way. One of these sleuths in the
employ of the federal government
drops in occasionally, uninvitod and
unlooked for. They have a plan of
operations peculiarly their own. A
brass band outfit to herald their com
ing is not according to their notion?.
The visitor in tbis city lately, so far
as we can learn, found nothing very
much out of tho way here. It ia re
ported that one saloon keeper was
subjected to a penalty for doing busi
ness without s license in bia own
name. It must be remembered that
liquor licenses are issued to tbe
individual aud not to the premises
A man buying out a saloon is re
quired to take out a new license, lit'
caunot carry on busiuess on the
license issued to his predecessor, no
matter it- the period covered by that
license has not expired. The revenue
laws are frequently changed, and
liquor rneu will do well to keep
posted Jon the changes, and thereby
•avoid liability to penalties. ln^Sacra
mento.lately a number of saloon man
were naught in the government net
through ignorance of the law. The
Sunday News explains it id this wise:
It seema that the revenue laws, ac
recently amended, lequire that when
saloon men or others desire to ieduo;
the proot of whiskey by the addition
of water or otherwise, they may do sr
in the demijohn, but not in the barrel
unless they hold a rectiDer'a license.
No taloou man thinks ot needing a
rectifier's license, and, accordingly,
is In the hahit ot reducing high proot
whiskey in the barrel by adding
water. The inspector easily found
out this fact,. aud when he had com
pleted his quest quietly disclosed his
identity. m The result is that number?
of liquor dealers have been compelled
to pay in lines snug sums that will go
to enrich tho lat surplus in the
federal treasury. It was all owing to
a misunderstanding ot the new regula
tions and not to any discovery of in
jurious adulterations or to any inten
tion to evade the law. Some of the
best known places in tbe city hove
bean caught in the government drag
net and have bad to respond in heavy
fines. Captain John Cook is said to
have been Hned 5250. The Ftter
Meulieu snioon was taxed §150 and
L'rauk Dittiieh 8100. There weie
several others, but thsir names could
not be ascertained.
The iuspector does not claim that
saloon men were guilty of trying to
impose on the public, but only that
they did uot follow tho letter of the
law in regard to reducing vbiskey in
demijohns and barrels.

There ia said to be a threatened fuel
famine at the mines hereabouts. The
difficulty seems to be in getting cars
to haul the oil. The Kennedy has but
a small stock on hand. The price of
oil is on the up grade. In Angels oil
has jumped t0 51.75 and $'2 per barrel,
which is nearly double tho price here
tofore, the mines around here are
under contract at a llxed rate. flow
long tlie contract runs, we do not
know; but it is likely uhen the
agreement empires, the price of this
uiateiiiil will be considerably advanc
ed. In some places the mine owners
are seriously thinking of returning to
wood tor fuel purposes. At 82 per
barrel for oil it is believed that wood
is the cheaper material at Su.oO per
cord.

MINING NOTES.
Zeila — Thia mine was shutdown, so
far as the extraction of ore is con
cerned, last Friday in order to do the
neceseary repairs to the shaft. The
mill also came to a standstill early
this week. The sulphurets works
are still running, and have enough
concentrates on hand to last about
three weeks. Over sixty miners were
laid otf, for the time being. How
long tbe shaft repairing will take to
complete is vory uncertain; probably
from three to four months. There is
only odo shaft at this mine, so that
it is impossible to keep the mill
supplied with oro and do the repair
ing at the same time.
Del Monte— This mine, in Sheep
ranoh district, in Calaveras oounty,
came to a standitill the close of laat
month. Tne shut down ia tor an in
deriuito period. Some tine ore w>s
taken out in the last mouths' run.
lhree quarters of a ton yield, d Sl2O
in free gold. There was but a small
seam of it. The managers, who are
mostly Jackson people, concluded
that it was advisable to close, and
straighten out the financial affairs.
Geo. 1. Wright, who is the promoter
and also the superintendent and
general manager, has secured a lease
on a promising claim in the heart ot
the GoldHeJd district, -one of tbe
claims owned by Ciande Smith,— and
intends to go there and commence
operations. He has strong hopes of re
couping in this new venture all the
money that has been spent at Del
Monte. He will distribute as a free
ottering to all Del Monte stook
holders, whose stock stands on the
books of the company free of all
indebtedness on the Ist of January
next, two shares of the Goldfieid
stock for every share of Del Monte
stock. Ho expeots to go east shortly
for the purpose of placing some of
the promotion stock there for work
ing purposes.
Kremont— A rich pocket has been
struok in this mine. Samples of the
ore may be seen at the Amador Bank.
They show free gold in abundance.
The ore ia very similar in appear
ance to that known as "black meral."
The gold is mainly coated with dark
sulphuretted ore, which subjected to
heat shows the free gold. Some fifty
boxes of this ore have been taken out,
and it is estimated that it is worth
S4OOO to tbe ton. The Fremont is
looking well, and paying a handsome
profit over operating expenses. Hurry
Osborne is foreman, and his work is
giving excellent satisfaction. He is
well posted on methods of mining on
the mother lode of Amadov, and this
knowledge gives him" a decided ad
vantage over those not conversant by
actual experience with tho conditions.
Lucky Chinaman.
Jim, the Chinese cook at the Globe
hotel, is the luckiest Mongolian hero
abouts. As a thanksgiving present he
received the information that the
ticket, or rather halt ticket Xo. 7894,
held by him in the Mexican lottery
distribution, had drawn the sum of
61000. The ticket cost him 81, and it
was the first dollar he had ever in
vested in that venture. Furthermore
it was not bought directly by hftn
self, but by a Chinaman in the Olym
puß restaurant. Jim is : naturally
greatly elated over his good fortune,
l'his is tbe biggest winning in a
lottery scheme tbat bas fallen to a
Jackson resident tor a long time. If
will probably give quite an impetus
to tho sale of tickets. A few prizes,
amounting to a tew dollars each are
heard of occasionally, but a windfall
of a clean thousand ia a novelty.
There is talk that lucky Jim intends
to take a trip to China on the strength
of his sudden wealth.

A FAMOUS DANCER.
Sir Christopher Hxttoti Won Roy.-.l
Honors hy Hi* Grace.
In Queen Bess' time Sir Christopher
Hatton won his way to the lord chan
cellorship by* his ability or agility in
terpsichorean lines. He first attracted
the notice of Queen Elizabeth by his
graceful dancing in a mask at court.
He henceforth became a Feigning fa
vorite, and his promotion was rapid.
He was successively made a gentle
man of the queen's privy chamber,
captain of the board of gentlemen pen
sioners (the bodyguard), vice chamber
lain and a member of the privy coun
cil. This delight of thexjueen to honor
him caused much envy. Complaints
were uttered tbat under the existing
government nothing could be obtained
by any others than "dancers and car
pet knights, such as the Earl of Lin
coln and Master Hatton."' On the
death of Lord Chancellor Bromley the
queen offered Hatton the groat seal.
Even while chancellor Sir Christopher
exhibited his skill in dancing. Attend
ing the marriage of his nephew and
heir with a judge's daughter, he was
decked, according to the custom of the
age, in his official robes, and when the
music struck up he doffed them, threw
them down on the floor and, saying,
"Lie there, Mr. Chancellor!" danced
the measures of the nuptial festivity.—
St James' Gazette.
A Tongue Twister.
Try it yourself, very slowly and care
fully until you can say it easily; then
pass it along to your friends. Here
it is:
"She stood at the gate, welcoming
him in."
Ten to one a person trying to pro
nounce the sentence for the first time
will fumble it laughably. Tongue
twisting sentences, however, are good
elocutionary exercises. They give you
control of your vocal organs so that
you can enunciate properly, just as
finger exercises on the piano or organ
give control of the fingers. What an
Immense amount of mechanical prac
tice does It require to establish any
thing like a close sympathy between
the brain and the physical organs!
DUDES OF OTHER TIMES.
Drcsa of a Dandy of the Early Nine
teenth Century.
A cure for the confirmed roller
against modern dress might be a course
of Inspection through a file of old
fashion magazines or the perusal of
such accounts as are given by the
author of "Sketches of Lynn." The
description is that of a suit worn in
the first part of the nineteenth century.
The boots were an important article
of dress. The toes were made as broad
as the ball of the foot, with the cor
ners well rounded, giving the shoe the
resemblance to the snout of a sb >vel
nosed shark. They were very snug and
required strong straps. In order to get
Into a fashionable pair the heel of the
stocking was well soaped and some
pulverized soap sprinkle .l Into tile bdot
The length of time it took to get one
on depended on the strength of thp
owner and the strap.
•The stylish overcoat ... five
oapes, one above the other. The
sers were expected to fit as tlj ht as the
skin. Just how they were put ou is a
mystery. The coat was especially snug
under the sleeves, and the velvet collar
scraped up the back of the head. The
camlet overcoats after a little wear,
became as stiff as birch bark.
The thing worn about the neck was
called a stock.. This name was appro
priate in its suggestion of arv instru
ment of punishment. The stock was
from three to six inches high, and was
made stiff. A man was forced to look
straight ahead. Only by careful man
agement couia he see a little on either
side. About halfway between bis eyes
and ears two little points of collar
stuck up like toothpicks.
Ruffled bosoms and wristbands fin
ished the costume, with the addition of
a tall silk hat. When inclosed in this
manner, with a dash of attar of roses
on his handkerchief, the man of the
period was considered irresistible.
Here is our condensed opinion of
the original laxative cough syrup:
"Nearly all other cough syrups are
constipating, especially thuse con
taining opiates. Kennedy's Laxative,
(containing) honey and tar moves the
bowels. Contains no opiates. Con

Habit-forming Medicines.
' Whatever may be the fact as to mat>y
of the so-called patent medicines cmi
taininc injurious iusredienta as broadly
fmblishcd in soino journals of more or
ess influence, this publicity has certainly
been of great benotit in arousing needed
attention to this subject, It has, Id a
considerable . measure, resulted in thr
most Intelligent people avoiding such
foods and medicines as may be fairly sus
pected of containing the injurious ingre
dients complained of.-- Eecognl ihi
fact some time ago, Dr. Pierce, of IJulTalo.
N. V., "took thne by the forelock," as ii
were. :v,id published broadcast all the
ingredients of which his popular i,. di
cines are composed. Tims ho has com
pletely forestalled all harping critics and
ell opposition that might otherwise be
urged against his medicines, because they
are now of known composition. Fur
thermore, from tho formula printed on
every bottle wrapper, it will be soon that
these medicines contain no alcoljol or
other habit-forming drugs. Neither do
they contain any narcotics or injurious
agents, their ingredients being purely
vegetable, extracted from the roots of
medicinal plants found growing in the
depths of our American forests and of
well .recognized curative virtues.
Instead of alcohol, which oven in sni;:!!
portions lons continued, as in obstinate
cases of diseases, "becomes highly objec
tionable from its tendency to produce a
craving for stimulants, Dr. Pierce em
ploys chemically pure, triple -refined
glycerine, which of itself is a valuable
remedy in many cases of chronic diseases,
being a superior demulcent, antiseptic,
antiterment and supporting nutritive.
It enhances the curative action cf tha
Golden Seal root. Stone rout. Black
Cherrybark and Bloodroot, contained in
■Golden Medical Discovery," in all bron
chial, throat and lung affections attended
with severe coughs. As will bo seen from
the writings of tho eminent Drs. Grover
Coe, of New York; Bartholow, of Jeffer
son Medical College, Phila.; Scudder. of
Cincinnati ; Elllngwood. of Chicago ;
Hale, of Chicago, and others, -who stand
as leaders in their several schools ol
practice, the foregoing agents are the
very best ingredients that Dr. Pierce
could have chosen to make up his fa
mous "Discovery" for the cure of not
only, bronchial, throat and ;tinc affec
tions, but also of chronic catarrh in a;
its various forms wherever located.
ARRESTING OTD AGE
Modern Life and tlic Lengthening
Period of Youth.
It may seem strange to us, though
Ihe faut nevertheless remains, that tha
veterans of the grand army of Na
poleon, weighed do-vn by age and
glory, were men of whom few had
passed their thirty-fifth year. It was a
time of rash and short living, with an
early age aud no overtures of real
youth— a time when we find Thackeray
ridiculing Dv Florae for holding claims
on being still a young man at the age
of thirty-fivo: The unmistakable tend
ency of our time to rejuvenate life and
to prolong or. rather, to vanquish' age.
is placing Its stamp on every event of
individual existence. The average man
today carries the spirit and power of
youth into an a.:e which a century ago
was regarded as bordering on the
shady side of existence. The buoyancy
and vigor characteristic of our present
middle, aged man make it in most
cases extremely difficult to approach
any fair degree of accuracy In deter

SUNDAY TRADING.
Markets : nd Fairs In Chnrcliyards In
Karly Knu.'i:iiiil.
It may safely.be assorted that from
the time of the Conqueror <10r,(M0S7)
Sunday trading received much atten
tion. In early] ages market i and fairs
were held on Sundays and frequently
In the churchyards.
In 1303 the Inhabitants of Cocker
mouth presented a petitl to to parlia
ment, ks their market »-as fast declin
ing through the iiui ibil:H:ts of Cros
thwaite dealing in corn, ilr.ir, beans,
flesh, llsh, at their church on Sundays
and that thereby they were unable to
pay their tolls' to the king (Edward I.).
An order was issued for closing the
church market at Crosthwaite.
At Bradford, Yorkshire, during the
same reign the market was held on a
Sunday, doubtless in the churchyard.
The toll yielded £3 per annum'.'
In 12S3 a statute was passed enact
ing that liencoforth : !ther fairs ur>r
markets be held i;i t'.mrchyards, for
the honor of tbe <!:v. "i.
In 1312 a market %-,-.::> -anted' to the
town of Seds'efieM, IJnvhtim, to be lieUl
on a Friday, but was t;aou changed to
Sunday.
In 1307 the archbishops of Canter
bury and York delivered charges di
recting, among other things, that "we
firmly forbid any one to keep a mar
ket in the churches, the porches and
the cemeteries thereunto belon^ing-or
other holy places on the Lord's day or
other holy festivals." — Notes and
Queries.
BLUE PAPER.
T The Process of HuJclEgr It Discovered
-by :i:i Accident.
. "X woman," said a paper maker, "in-
v vented blue paper. It was by accident
i that she did it though. Before her time
n nil paper was white.
" "She was the wife of William Eastes,
I one of the leading paper makers of
E England in the eighteenth century. In
i passing through the piper plant - one
: day she dropped a big blue bag into" a
: ■ vat of pulp. Eastes was a stern chap,
I and so, since no one had seen the acci
ddent, Mrs. Eastes decided to say noth
iing about it.
. "The paper in the vat, which should
h have been white, came out blue. The
w workmen • were mystified, Eastes en-
r raged. Mrs. Bastes kept quiet. . The
. upshot was that Hie paper was sent to
L London, marked 'damaged,' to be sold
: for whatever it would bring.
' "But the selling agent in London
: was shrewd. He saw that this blue
i tinted paper was attractive. lie de
1 clared it to be a wonderful new inven
::, tion, and be sold it off like hot cakes
j at double the white paper's price,
j ■ "Eastos'soou received an order for
; more of the blue paper— an -order that
i he and his men wasted several days
| in trying to vainly till. -
" "Then Mrs. Eastes cittne . forward
I and told the story of the blue cloth
j bag. There was no difficulty after
t that In making the bit* paper., This
• paper's price remained very high, the
I Eastes having a monopoly In It.".

A An Incident which, the writer de-
c clares, raised the pugnacious sparrow
s several degrees In his estimation is
d described in Outing. It shows tl^it the
s sparrow has other good qualities be-
s sides his sturdluess and, self reliance.
F For several days four or five "sparrows
h had visited a certain place on the roof
n near my window. They always brought
f food for another little fellow, who
n never tried a flight from the. spot. The
v visiting sparrow.-; never came empty
b billed. They would drop tiny morsels
o of food near the little sparrow. When
i it began to eat the crumbs the others
s set up a great chirping and then flew
a away. After watching this for a few
d days I went out on the roof and. ap-
p proached the lone bird. It did not flut
tter away from me and made no resist-
a ance when I picked it up. The spar-
r row was blind. Its eyes "were covered
w with a milklike Bhn.
rommon Cane.
The Scotchman's disposition to re
gard his own Judgment as the^>est that
can be found is -well illustrated in a
story once told of the moderator of a
Scotch presbytery. This man's opinion
differed widely on a certain question
relating to church discipline from that
of the associates with whom he was
ostensibly consulting. At last he said
that he would lay the matter before the
'Lord in prayer and then wait for his
guidance. "O I.o:\V said the mod
erator fervently and with perfect sin
cerity of purpose, "O Lord, giant that
we may be right in this matter, for
tliou knowest that we are very be
dded."

Tlie fljeks of llamas belonged to the
bud and the Inca. It was death to
kill one. At certain seasons of the
year they wore collected from the bills
and shorn. Large numbers were sent
U sup] Iy Co 1 1 for the court and tj be
used at the religious festivals a:id sac
clflceS. Male llamas only were killed.
Thfe wool belonged to the Inca end
was stored In the government deposi
tor^ and dealt out according as the
!■■ . ' '■ wants reqniTed, In this way
they we v provjUod with warm cloth
ing. When they bad worked up enough
wool Into clothing for themselves they
were thea omj I iyed iv worMog up
material for the Inca. The distribu
tion of the woal ::::i sr.perinteudeuce
of its manufacture were in the luinJs
of officers appointed for the purpose.
Xo oae was allowed to be idle. Idle
ness was a crime and was severely
punished.
All the mine.-; belonged to the Inca
and were worked for his benefit. The
various employments were usually in
the hands of a few and became heredi
tary. What Uie lather was, that the
son became. A great part ot" the agri
cultural products was stored in grana
ries scattered up and dowu the coun
try and was uo:ilt out to the people as
required It will thus i>o seen that
there was no chance for a man t i ■■
come rich, neither could he become
poor. The spirit of speculation had no
existence there.— Chambers' Journal.
THE BLACK BALL.
A Clever Scheme Th:it Was Sp.iileil
In the Drawing.'
Two youug uion iv a Freuch village
were called on to draw for conscrip
tion. One only was wanted to complete
the number, ami of tlie two who were
to draw one was the sou of a rich farm
er aud the other the child of a poor
widow.
The farmer ingratiated himself with
the superintendent of tho ballot and
promised him a present if ho could find
means to prevent his son from going
iv the army. Iv order to accomplish
this the official put into the nru two
black balls instead of one white and
one black ball. When the young men
came, he said:
"There are two balls, one black aud
one white, In the urn. He who draws
the black one must serve. Yonr turn
is fir.n," pointing to the widow's son.
The latter, suspecting that all was
not fair, approached the urn and drew
one of the balls, which he immediately
swallowed wiihout looking at it.
"Why," said the superintendent,
'•have you done that" How are we to
know whether you have drawn a black
or a white b:i!!?"
"Oh, that's vt'ry easy to discover,"
was tho reply. "Let the other now
draw. If I have the black, he must
necessarily draw the white one."
There \v;:s no help for It, and the
farmer's son, putting his hand into the
urn, drew the remaining ball, which, to
the satisfaction of the spectators, was
a black one.
P ranks of the Types.
Tom Moa:-e wrote the line, "Had
taken up in heaven his position," but
the printer made it read, "Had taken
up to heaven !.!.; p!i~3ician." In a
weekly story paper a love story con
tained no less il'.Lin twenty ridiculous
errors. Instead of falling into a rev
erie the young lady fell into the river;
"bull pup" appeared for "pull up,"
"nasal" for "natal" anil "trombone"
for "trembling." The fair heroine was
awfully "hungry" instead of "angry."
Her heart was ailed with "et ceteras"
and not "ecstasies," aud when sho
meant fo say "thine" the types made
her say, "i am thin, I am wholly thin."
A newspaper in telling of a cow cut
into halves by a railway train said the
cow was cut Into calves.
A Cutting Rebel i:
In some parts of Scotland it is cus
tomary for v bride to bring v dower to
her uusJkuh!. no matter how little.
One couple who had experienced the
strife of wedded blisa for some years
wore having the usual row, when Uie
husband taunted the lady with the
paucity of worldly goods with which
she had endowed him.
"Awa!" said he. "Wnen ye tnarrit
tue n' yo brought was a cask o' whisky
an' the auld Bible."
"Weel, Jock," was the response, "gin
ye had paid as mockle attention to tlie
book as ye did tae the whisky, ye
would hae been a ineeuister o' the
gospel the noo."
