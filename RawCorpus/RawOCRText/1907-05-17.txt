To improve ujioa the present
metnoda ot bringing coal to .London
is n fascinating problem. By the
plan of H. U. l'hwuite, cheap slack
would be used for ' producing gaa,
which would supply engines for driv
ing electric generators, and a current
of <iO,OOO volts would bo sent ironi tlio
coal fields over 120 miles of wire to
tbe metropolis. Tbe fuel would cost
about twoliltha as muob as is usually
paid while tbere would be an enor
mous saving in tbe rent ot land for
generating stations. A project] of
Arthur J. Martin is to generate gas at
the coal mines of South Yorksuiie,
•md transmit it under v pressure of
500 pounds per square inch by a pipe
Hue of 173 miles. Tbe 40.000 millions
of cubic feet of gas required annually
by greater London could he conveyed
through a single line of pipes 2a
inches in diameter. Though tbe pipe
line would cost $7,000,000 or 55,000,
000, and 40,000 borse-power would be
needed to compress the gas, it is
estimated that tbe London companies
could be supplied witb gas at 15 cents
per 1000 feet— much below present
oost.
The crescent-shaped aand-duues
which move id thousands across the
desert of Islay, near La Joya, Peru,
have beeu investigated by Astronomer
S. 1. Uailey, who found the points of
a crescent to be 160 feet apart, while
tbe convex side measured 477
and the greatest width was more tbau
100 feet. Tbe estimated weight was
8,000 tons, yet it was carried 125 feet
a year by tbe prevailing south winds.

that defied all climDers until the
memorable ascent in 1865 by Mr
Wbymper, Lord IJouglas, aud their
Outnpamons. The road is to be
operated on tbe familiar cog-wheel
system. Tbere will be two sections
one extending from the Viege station
at Zermatt to the Mattorborn but,
and tbe second running from the but
through a tunnel TtiiiO ieet long to a
point within 60 feet ot the summit,
which has an altitnde of 11,780 feet.
Ihe upper terminus will embrace a
number ot rooms cut in the solid
rock. It will be provided with vari
ous novel conveniences, not least ot
which will be a special chamber tilled
with compressed oxygen tor tourists
suffering from mountain sickness.
A remarkable telegraph circuit 4,000
miles in length— probably tbe longest
in tbe world— has been in operation
more than a year between London and
Teheran. It traverses tbe North Sua
for 200 miles, and passes through
Belgium, Uermany, Russia, 'iurkey
in Asia]and Persia. Wheats-tone auto
matic transmitters and receivers are
employed. Hy this system ftum 80 to
100 words per minute can be trans
mitted while only 25 to 35 can be
sent by tbe Morse hand apparatus.
At ten stations— Lowestoft, blmbden,
Warsaw, Berlin, Kouno, Odessa,

Near the Medicine Bow Kiver, iv
Wyoming, is tbe oddest cabin known,

He stated that tbe action Mas under
instructions from the company and
that had be not have acted as he did,
they would have discharged him and
employed a superintendent who would
have carried out their orders.
lie further stated that all rumors
about a compromise was only idle
talk, as tbe company would in no way
listen to such proposition and that it
the mine at any time resumed work
it would be on tbe old basis ot wages.

ot Angels Camp will have to look

commented preparations for dis
continuing their buisness.
This means that tbe real sufferers,
in addition to the merchants, will be
those who by tbeir thrift and industry
have established themselves iv differ
ent lines of business and also those ot
tbe workmeu who bavo built their
homes, but will now have to seek em
ployment elsewhere. —Angels Kecord.

He had been in (jolddeld but a few
short hours when he went into the
Monte Cristo. On the floor bis eye
oonnected with a 10-cent piece. He
picked up tbe coin from tbe floor and
walking over to a nearby roulette
wheel, placed it on "17," the gam
bler's number. Theie was a heavy
play at the time, but little attention
was paid to Connor's bet. "Seventeen
in the black," drawled tbe dealer,
and calmly proceeded to take and pay
the numerous bets strung out on tbe
layout. "Thirty-five lor one, and
your money back," drawled the
dealer as be laid three dollars and a
four-bit piece beside the dime.
Connors picked up tbe money and
elbowed bis way to a faro game.
Luck was still witb him, and as he
won be increased the size of his bets.
The Monto Cristo has tbe highest
limit of any house in town, 8100 in
cases, and Connors was not long in
reaching it. The pikers soon quit,
and he bad tbe layout to himself for
the greater part ot tbe time, witb a
dense crowd gathered around tbe
table wntcbing tbe play. Time after
time did ho call tbe turn, uutil, at
last, weary ot the game, he cashed in
SCSOO winner off a dime which h«
found ou tbe floor.

Letter From an Old Pioneer.
Uu my return from Jackson 011 tbe
morning of April 30, John Eckait
called on me to mow the grass off hia
lot near tbe mouth of Soldier*' gulch, '
and to prepare and plow tbe same to
plnut in potatoes by the following
Wednesday. Within two hoars after
1 started to work, 1 was informed
that Eckart had just died of heart
trouble. He was well Hxed Uuancial
ly, and leaves considerable monej
and property to bis two daughters,
Mrs Uoberts and Mrs McDonald of
Stockton. He is the flfth superin
tendent who has passed over the great
divide since the organization of the
Volcano liold Gravel Mining Com
pany. Ihe company was organized
in 1876, aud N. U. Young made tbe
first survey preliminary to organiza
tion. 1 furnished the first supplies,
and did tbe Urst work, and put 00
tbe Urst men to run tbe tunnel.
Benjamin Koss did the surveying,
and 1 carried the Dag. We found the
tunnel had to be 2200 feet long, com
ing out at south branch 43 feet 0
inches lower than the old tunnel. All
tbe years tbe Voloano flat has been
worked, and large returns have gone
to tbe stockholders. Now, lam told,
tbe basin is to be sold for reservoir
purposes. It is said the flat has al
ready been bonded for that purpose
by the Mclaughlin estate.
On tbe 20th of June, 1852, 1 crossed
tbe Missouri liter, near Council
Bluff, on my way to California. In
the company were 50 wagons, James
Stewart captain, who ware emigrating
tv Salt Luke. 1 attended to captain
Si e wait's baggage wagon for passage
through. We reached Salt Lake
September 22d. All tbe way up tbe
Platte river tbe trail was strewn with
grares, until we reacbed tbe Kooky
mountains. We only lost one in our
train— old man Stevens, who on the
'night preceding bis death was on
guard with me. Every time It rained
tbe cattle broke. Twice 1 heard his
voice on tbe other side of the camp
calling tbe hours as they passed.
"One o'clock and all is well." That
hour tbe guard was changed. lie
retired to his wagon, and 1 to my
tent. In tbe morning he was dying;
and so passed away.
We followed tbe trail of the Path
finder, Fremont, for whom 1 cast my
Urst vote for president in 1856, and
have voted for eveiy republican presi
dent since that time.
; March 10, 1853, 1 left Salt Lake,
taking the southern route for Cali
fornia, passing through several new
settlements in a rich and fertile
country. We passed over the river
of tbe basin to Mountain Meadows— a
beautiful place — where we camped
two days. The .Mountain Meadow
massacre occurred in 1877: From
here we passed through an Indian
country. Tbe Indians stampeded our
stock and killed one of our men.
Several times we were lined up in
battle arrayjto save the company from
masfcaore. We passed over the 54 mile
desert mostly in tbe mgbt, and arriv
ed in San Bernardino on the 15th of
May. 1 reached Stockton August 22,
1853.

and tbe New i'oik Kanob road back to

condition than for years, whether the
diamond searchers or tbe supervisors
are entitled to the credit of tbe im

F fUDAY-..::. \>. :./::.. MAY 17. 1907:
The Labor, Situation in Amador.
The requeit for recognition ot
the miiwrs'-aoioa of, the Western
Federation upou the iniae owners
around Jackson has created a feeling
of uureat in all classes. Ihe uncer-
t taiuty is having a very prejudicial j
e effect upon bu3iuesj, which has not j
b b9e:i brisk any way for some time.
E Extreme measures on the part of the
u union iniaars at this juncture would
b bc folly, even though the oompanie3
s should positively decliob to recognize
t the union. The * miiiea have . been
r runuius along without any recogaitiuii
o of labor organizations so far, ao'l it
c cobld harJly ba expected th.it mine
o o.v:i,)ri will asiuina a different atti
ttada co.yard uuioniaai no.v to that
w which they have taken heretofore.
T The probability is that, pressure to
a accomplish that cud would result in
t tbe shutting djwn of -the mining
i industry. ' <.. • ~ •' " 7 "
A Angels Camp •■ presents today a
s striking example of the effect ot work
o of labor agitators, who are in reality
p puabing a campaign, not in the inter-
e est or for the benefit of the toilers,
b but against ' property and employers 1
g generally. Their oreed is to break
u up tbe wage system entirely. Higher
w wages and shorter hours .are merely
a a mask to hide the ultimate design
t to abolish tbe .relationship of em-
p ployer and employed. The extrem-
i ists of these walking delegates— tbe
h hold-up men of tbe industrial world
--freely admit that there is no stopp-
i ing place in. their crusade short of the
b brake-up of I the present system of
w wage-paying. Angels, heretofore the
l liveliest towns in Calaveras, and one
o of the best business centers in the
m mountains, is a dead camp today.
A Agitators, by inflaming and prejudic-
i ing the minds', of tbe miners, . can
b bring about ruin, but they are im-
p potent to restore, prosperity .to that
s stricken camp. Her industry <is
p paralyzed, the mines are filling up
w with water, business houses are clos
iing, and her population is leaving by
t the handieds. Everything points to
a a permanent . abandonment of mines
w which have given employment- to
h hundreds of men, and imparted life to
t tbe town. What do .these alien
a agitators care for the ruiu their evil
p preachings have wrought? They are
m merely birds of passage and of prey.
T They can gather their grip sack and
l leave the scene of wreckage without
m monetary loss to themselves, depart-
i ing for new fields of industry to lay
w waste with their infamous doctrines..
K Kven the presence of . such men has a
d damaging effect upon every class of
b usiness.-; • '..
T The attitude of the mine • owners is
p pretty well understood. They will
m maintain the "open-shop"' principle
i in their mines, employing whom they
p please without regard to affiliation
o or non-affiliation , with any labor
o organization. Kuther than surrender
-this right to hire laborers without
d dictation, the mines hereabouts
w would probably close-down as they
h hava closed in the erstwhile thriving
t town of Angels. iSuoh an outcome
m might give birth to exultation .011
t the part of agitators, but what would
t the miners gain thereby; what benefit
w would those toilers who have their
h homes and families here reap? The
g grip-sack .' brigade ' can * tramp else-
w where, in search of employment, and
b bug the delusion that they will feel
n no harm. But even this class must
r realize that eventually the ruinous
s system will overtake them also.
l lndustrial centers cannot be paralyz-
e ed one after another without suffer
iing to the masses of toilers. it is as
c certain us the decrees of fate, that
w wage-earners cannot prosper without
t the prosperity of the wage-payers,
a and the sooner the workers under-
s stand this, ..and act accordingly, the
b better will it he for all concerned.
A Starvation Reservation.
The conditions of the Indian rn
servatiou, some three miles noithoa.--t
of Jackson, ia a reproach to the
national government. tJeo. O. CJrist
is in charge ot the reservation, and
lias made repeated efforts to secute
funds from the authorities at Wash
mgton to carry .ou a benevolent work,
but without avail. .Lately he asked
for the small appropriation of 832S
for general supplies, seed, wheat etc.,
and received a reply that nothing
could be done, inasmuch aa the Indian
agent C. K. Kelsey, Jiving at Sau
ikse, bad not reuomaieuded. the
appropiiatiou. Tho Indian coluuj
housed within the reservation has
dwindled down tv twelve souls, all
old am inUrm. incapable of rustling
for themselves. • For more than two
years the sum total received for tbe
maintenance of these wards has been
&23. Just think of it— au average of
nine cents per head donated for the
support and clothing of these native
sons and daughters. Of course tkey
have either to starve or beg, and
they naturally cbooae the beggiug
path, and in this way have become a
nuisance to tbe white settlers iv the
neighborhood. It is a shame upon tho
national government that such things
should be. This reservation : is a
curse instead of a blessing. It
hinders instead of helps them to make
a livelihood. Far better to abolish it
altogether, than continue tbe existing
farce.

An Effect of the Iron Trades' Strike.
A An illustration of how the strike of
t tbe iron trades is driving business
f from" San -Francisco,, is afforded by
t tiro fact that a few days ago there was
r received at the", machine shop of Gar
bbailui Bros, a bucket belonging to
o one of the water wheels of the Stand-
a ard Klectric Company at Klcctra,
u used in the generation ' of electric
e energy. This bucket is a ponderous
t thing in itself, weighing 375 -pounds
w with two bolts that fasten it to tho
w wheel it 'weighs ■ over . 400 pounds.
T There are eighteen ot these buckets
o on one wheel so I that tbe aggregate
w weight of the buckets alone is in the
n neighborhood of ' four .tons. The
b bucket in question bad become broken
a at tbe eye, and was sent to the Doble
f foundry and machine works to.be
r repaired. The strike cume, aud the
w work was left undone on their bands.
l ln this emergency the casting was
s sent back to this county to be repair-
e ed. It may be seen at the Garbarini
B Bros, machine works, awaiting to bo
p put in working shape.
Miners' Union Meeting.
The regular meeting of tbe local
Miners' Union W. l<\ M., was held
Wednesday night. It was expected
that the answer of the various mines
to the request for recognition of the
union, would come up for discussion,
if not final action. Consequently
there was a big gathering of the
members. Nothing on this matter
was done however, precisely why we
arc unal.le to explain. It is rumored,
however, that tbe companies had
made co direct reply to tbe request
for recognition; that, they wanted to
be informed of the scope and effect of
the recognition wanted, iv fact they
wanted to be enlightened fully as to
tho meaning of the request before
answering. So tbe matter went over
until Saturday, when auotber meeting
is to be called. The session Wed
nesday was a stormy one, and it was
evident to those on tbe outside that
the members were wide apart on the
questions debated. The "lie" was
passed and much acrimony engendei
ed. It is simply a contest between
tbe radical and conservative wings of
tbe organization — tbe hot-heads
versus the level-headed members.

Among tbe visitors iv Jackson last
week we forgot to mention Judge
John l'ule of Oakland. He arrived iv
this city Wednesday, and returned to
Oakland tbe following day. He is
president aud principal stockholder
of tbe Stcne Canyon Consolidated
Coal Mining Company, whose works
are situated in the Gabilan mountains
iv the southeastern part of Monterey
county. The editor of tbe Ledger
visited this property two weeks ago,
and was shown all through the works,
embracing over 5000 feet of drifts and
tunnels cut through a solid wall ot
coal tbe entire distance, averaging
about n'fteeu feet in width. The idea
is prevalent that no first-class coal
bas been discovered in California.
This notion, however, bas been dis
proved by the developments in Stone
canyon. The product of this mine is
only surpassed by the celebrated
anthracito coal of Pennsylvania, and
all tbe developments and indication?
point to a vast deposit— one wbicb
cannot be exhausted in a century ot
activity. The mine is situated twenty
miles or more from the nearest rail
road point, and hence tbe coal cannot
be handled profitably until cheap,
rapid transportation is provided by
the construction of a railioad to the
mine. To the accomplishment of this
task the company is now bending its
energies, floating bonds bearing six
per cent interest with a substantial
bonus ot stock as an additional in
ducement to investors. Mr George
liurbeck was in this county last week
for the purpose of selling bonds. The
visit of Judge Yule was also on busi
ness concerning the coal mine. The
company is anxious to construct the
railroad this year, and have tbe coal
on the market by tbe beginning ot
next year.

THE AMADOR LEDGKE: JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MAY IT 1907.
Dwelling House Burned.
About ten o'clock Tuesday night
Ihe liro alarm boll rang out. its omin
ous sound, startling ail who heard lU
warning notes. Ouly a smali portion
of tho peoplo hoard the sound, bow
ever. Many of those ou Main street,
within two blocks ot tho tiro house,
whore the bell is located, wero unable
to hear its peals of waruiug. Tho lire
proved to be in the north part of
town, the dwelling house belonging
to Mrs Genaro, ou the Jackson Gate
road, opposite the Savich boarding
house, aud occupied as a sleepiug
house in connection with his board
iug place. It was used for sleepiug
rooms exclusively, aud provided with
electric lights throughout.
Volunteer tire lighters were speedily
ou the ground, and two streams of
water were soon playing on toe
tlunies. ihe tire had gained con
siderable headway before the alarm
was given, the whole interior of tbe
building beiug a mass of llames,
especially the rear part. In a few
minutes after the water streams got
into play the fire was under control.
The building was a frame oae entire
ly, and other frame dwellings were
within a few feet ou either side, Mrs
Geuaro with her daughter, Mrs Carley
aud family occupying tbe one to tbe
south. The firemen managed to con
fine the damage entirely to tbe dwell
ing where tbe tire originated. That
they were able to do such effective
work was in a groat measure due to
tbe fact that the water main in that
pait of town was materially enlarged
two or three years ago, thereby giv
ing au ample supply for Hre purposes.
How the lire originated is a
mystery. There were thirteen beds
i i tho house. Every .apartment was
provided with an electric light. Ihore
was no stove in tho house, aud no 'use
for either caudles or coal oil lamps.
Evidently uone of these was used
about the premises. Three of tbe
lodgers had letired to bed. One was
attracted by the beat tbat seemed to
come from a dark closet in an adjoin
ing room. Proceeding to this closet
he-found it was all ablaze. Evidently
the roomers tried to extinguish the
(lames themselves before raising an
alarm, aud iv tbat way much valuable
time was lost.
Scarcely any of the furniture was
saved, except that in the two front
rooms.
Tbe building is practically a total
loss, although tbe roof was only
pattially burned off, and tbe outside
charred iv places. The interior of
four rooms was charred to a cinder.
An insurance of $300 was carried on
tbe buildiug, which will hardly covor
tbe loss. Tbe loss of furniture will
amount to several hundred dollars.
It is supposed tbat tt c fire originat
ed frum smoking, lv fact that is the
only rational theory from the cir
cumstances. There is no suspiciou
whateve. ot incendiarism. Perhaps
one of the roomers had placed bis
pipe cr cigar not fully extinguish!.;!
in tbe pocket of his clothing, and
thereafter hung the garment iv the
dark closet and went to bed.
Blue Rock Shooting.
There was more blue rook shooting
by tbe members of the local gun club
at their usual meeting place beyond
tbe Zeila last Sunday afternoon.
There was not so large au attendance
of tbe sporting fraternity as on tbe
previous meeting. Practice shooting
was kept up the whole afterarcn.
Instead of having the total number ot
shots and bits published, it was de
cided to have one innings expiessly
for the press at each practice shoot.
This is tbe score last Sunday out of
25 shots each :
C. Dal Porta - - - 22 .
Gus Laverone - - 21
T. K. Gorman - - 17
Wm; 11 ess - - - 17
C. Arditto - - - 2!J
11. Stark - - 14
It is the intention ot the club to
have a bluejay shoot at an early date.
The county pajs a buuety of two
cents each for the scalps of those
birds. So it is proposed to have a
hunt expressly for these pe-ts, and
probably offer a reward for the high
est individual score made.
Mahara's Minstrels.
A section of Matiara'a minstrels
struck Jackson Wednesday, giving v
■ lnnv in Liove's ball tbat evening,
oome peoplo flock to a show given by
a negro troupe just tbe same as to v
circus. Perhaps this is because of
the novelty of the thing," it certainly
cannot be because ot the superior
character of the performance. We
uever saw a lot of negro performers
yet that could begin to compare with
whites either in minstrelsy or acting.
Mahara'a company is no exception
to tbe rule. Except tor one or two
good voices in singing, they were a
poor lot. Their jokes were of the
flatest, and their acting vvas,wretched.
I'be only high tone part of tbe atfaii
vvas the price of admission— Sl for
reserved seats and 7uc for unreserved
or standing room. Aud they wero
not particular auout selling reserved
seats after all the seats were taken —
in other words tbe money was taken,
and the payees had to rustle their own
seats or stand. The bilkiug business
was more in evidence than Hue
minstrelsy. Aud the printer came iv
tor a shaie of tbe fraud tactics. The
Leiger's bill for advertising was re
fused payment on the llimay pretext
that the advanou ageut who ordered
the same had neglected to U. K. the
claim. The boss of the concern was
bigh-miuded enough to thiuk this was
a justification for wiggling out of tbe
obligation. The amount was small,
but had a magistrate been available
at that hour of the night we would
have takeu legal proceedings to
collect the amouut, even though it
cost many times the amount for costs,
to our brother pabliears we say look
out for these oolored folks. Get your
advenaiug mouev in advance. Ihat
is the ouiy safo way of dealing with
such a combination.

Oldest Squaw Dies.
Manutlla, the oldtrst. squnw in Iho
two comities of Amador aud Cala
voraa, died ou Saturday morning last,
about thruo o'clock, at Sau Andreas.
She belonged to tho Indian samp at
Scottsyille, this county, aud passed
most of ber days In that neighborhood
under the shadow of liutto mountain.
Her exact ago is unknown, as is the
oase with nearly all the aboriginal
inhabitants. They have no method ot
keeping count beyona the limit of a
few moons. But it is gonerally con
ceded that the lite of the deceased
spanned nearly a century. Her re
collections roaciied back far .beyoij'l
tbe first settlement of the white nra>]
in this vicinity. She was apparently
advanced in middle ase wheu the liist
pioneers swarmed into this section in
thoir quest of gold. With her passing
into the great unknown, the last
living link that connected the Indian
regime with the advent of the white
man has been broken.
Her "umbra" — husband — died sever
al years back. At that time they
were the two oldest Indians, and as
suoh a photograph of the pair was
taken at Mokelumne Hill sorce time
prior to the old man's demise. The
picture was secured after much per
suasion, and with the additional aid
of a littlo money. Nearly all Indians
have a great aversion to being pboto
craphed. They balk before the camera
dend. Manuolla had twelve children,
all of whom precedod her to the
grave, except one son.
With the appearance of th« gold
seekers, this Indian woman learned
the business of prospecting for gold
pretty thoroughly. In this way she
managed to pick up enough to supply
her with tbe necessaries of life. She
followed this avocation to within a
few days ot her death. Indeed, hor
tatal illness was, we are informed,
the result of a prospecting trip inlo
Calaveras county. She left the
Si-ottsville camp a few days before
ber death, apparently in ber ao
cuntomed health, and crossed into
Calaveras, on a gold-bunting tour.
She undertook to wade through B
stream. From this act— extremely
dangerous at her age— she contracted
a cold, which rapidly developed into
a fatal illness. She was removed tc
Sau Andreas, being unable to make
tho journey home. A doctor wot
summoned, but in epito of all that
could be done, the vital forces
gradually languished to a standstill.
It was her dying wish tbat she be
buried at the ludiau cemetery on tht
goverumenc reservation in thit
county, some three miles northeast
of JacKson. So - the lenjains were
conveyed from San Andreas to tin
ScuttsvUlo camp ou Sunday. Thf
survivors ot the camp made a great
powbow, according to aboriginal
customs. The burial took place at
tho Indian reservation on Monday, the
Diggers gathering from far and near
to do honor to the memory of this
veteran mother ot the tribo.
Visit of Special Land Agent.
Under a recent law of congress it
is ueoessary, before patent is finally
issued in homestead or timber claims,
that a special agent ot tbe laud office
make a personal visit to oaTsb entered
tract, investigate the facts, aud report
to the general land office. lv com
plian/je with this provisiou, H. C
Cullom, a nephew of U. S. Senator
Cullom of Indiana, accompanied by
bis wiEe, spent over a week traveling
through Amador county, viaiting
every homestead or other entry, for
which Unal proof had bten made,
patents for which have beeu held up
at Washington pending the outcome
of tho personal visit. Ho was in
Jackson on Saturday, aud the follow
ing day went up into Defender dls ;
trict, and the timber region beyond,
to iaspeot tho numerous entries which
have beeu passed «p to tho general
land office in that region, lie expect
ed to be engaged four or livo days in
tnat section. Mr Cullom and wife
aie from Oakland. The Oakland
(inquirer of May 11 coutaiued au
item to the effect tbat Hanry C.
Cullom, a retired real estat9 dealer
and a brother of United States
Senator Shebly M. Cullom of Illinois,
was struck by aa automobile at Hay
ward Wiursday. Mr Cullom, who i=
past sixty, is coutlued to his hoiue at
tierkeley as a result of the accident.
Tne injured man ia doubtless father
of the special ageut. Whether he had
heard ct tbe accident tefore he
arrived here Saturday evening we do
not know, but probably ho had not,
aa he made no mention ot tho matter
to those witb whom he conversed.
Quietly Wedded.
At six o'clock Tuesday morning
Je3se McLaughlin of Kleetra au:l i\li=;
ldalia Uiaocchio were united in tbe
t'ouiis of matrimoDy. 'L'Uo cfiremony
was performed at the residence of Ihe

An Owl Electrocuted.
Last Friday evening there was a
brilliant electrical display toward
Sutter Creek. It was about ciue
o'clock, aud a number watched the
■inusiial phenomenon fioni Jackson.
They were at a loss to understand the
■;ause ot it, although it was evident
that something was amiss with the
power line. Hoports were soon cur
rent that a transformer either at the
Coutral fclureka or South EureUa bad
burned out. These reports, fortun
ately pmved to be orroueous. it
seems tho scene of the display was on
Sutier hill, near tho reservoir. An
enormous owl had short circuited the
lino by coming iv contact with both
wires. It was electrocuted iv short
order, its charred body was after
wards found lying underneath tho
line. Iho grouud theieabouts al-o
bore evidence of the woik of tbe
iestructivo current. Uowover, DO
rlaaiage was sustained by tho line, and
tho power supply ing tbe mines in
that vicinity waa only slightly inter
rupted. It is probable that the uight
bird was attempting to tly between
!.he two wires, and iv so doing its
outstretched wings came iv contact
.vith both wires, oud so brought on
the display ot lireworks.
There were six wire 3 constituting
the power lino, aud tbe interruption
thus caused thiew tho greater part ot
the oaf rent outotha other lines. The
grouuded current charged a lmibed
wire fence, the lightening dancing up
scores of feet aad lighting up the
vl-.ole country for mile 3 around. It
vas a sight beautiful aud yet awe
inspiring. Tho barbs of tl-.e wire
fence were found upon examination
to have beeu burned oil tor a con
siderable distauoe.

DIED SUDDENLY
OF HEART DISEASE.
H How frequently does a h<»d line simi
llar to the above greet us In the news-
p papers. The rush, push and strenuous-
n ness of the American people has a strong
t tendency to lead up to valvular and other
a affections of tho heart, attended by ir-
r regular action, palpitation, dizziness,
s smothered sensations and other distress
iing 'symptoms.
T Three of the prominent ingredients of
•which Dr. Pierco's Golden Medical Dis-
c covery is made are reconwncndod by some.
o of the leading writers on Materta Medico.
f for the cure of just such case. Golden
S Seal root, for instance, is s:ald by the
U United States Dispensatory, a stand-
a ard authority, "to Impart tone and In-
c creased power to tho heart's action."
N Numerous other leading authorities rep-
r resent Golden Seal as an unsurpassed
t tonic for the muscular system in general,
a and as the heart is almost wholly com-
p posed of muscular tissue, it naturally
f follows that it must bo greatly strength-
e ened by this superb, general tonic. But
p probably the most important ingredient
o of " Golden Medical Discovery," so far
a as its marvelous cures of valvular and
o other affections of the heart are con-
c cerned, is Stone root, or Collinsonui Can.,
P Prof." Wm. Paine, author of Paino's
E Epitomy of Medicine. says of it:
" L not Ion? since, had a patient v>-ho was
s so much oppresssd with valvular disease of
t the heart that his friends were obliged to
c carry him up-statrs. He, however, gradually
I acoverud undsr the influence of Cclllnsonln
( (medicinal principle extracted from Stone
root),r oot), and is now attending to Ms business.
H Herotoforo physicians knew of no remedy
l lor the removal of so distressing; and so dan-
g gerous a malady. With them It was all
S Srues3-work. and It foarfully warned tho
a afflicted that death was near at hand. Col
lllnsonin unquestionably affords relief in
s such cases, and In most instances effects a
c cure." ,
S Stone root Is also recommended by Drs.
H Hale and Ellingwood, of Chicago, for
v valvular and other diseases of the heart.
T The latter says: "It is a heart tonic of
d direct and permanent influence."
" "Golden. Medical Discovery," not only
c cures serious heart affections, but is a
m most efficient general tonic and invlgor-
a ator, strengthening the stomach, invig-
o orating the liver, regulating tho bowels
a and curing catarrhal affections in all
p parts of the system.
D Dr. Pioree's Pullets ;uro Constipation.
Tfce KcTvborn and tbe Dead.
Lavater iv his "Physiognomy"' makes
tbe foliov.-'ug cui\o;is remarks: "I have
had occasion to observe some infants
Immediately on their births and have
found an astonishing resemblance be
tween their proSJe and tbose of their
father. A few d:iys after this resent-
blance almost entirely disappeared.
Tbe influence of the air and food and
probably tho change of posture bad go
filtered the de3lga of tbe face that you
could have believed it a different indi
vidual. I afterward s:tw two of tb.-se
children uio, one at six weeks and tbe
other at four years of age, and about
twelve hours after their death they im
mediately recovered the profile which
had struck me so much at their birth,
only the profile of the dead child was,
as might be expected, more strongly
marked and more terse tbau that of
the living."
Spider Chase:! a Man,
A story is told by an explorer of a
large and fierce South American spider
■which chases men if they come too
near its lurking places. On one occa
sion he was pursued by one. "Riding
at an easy trot over tbe dry grass," be
writes, "I observed a spider pursuing
me, leaping swiftly along and keeping
up with my beast. I aimed a blow with
my whip, and tbe point of the lash
struck the ground close to it, when it
instantly leaped upon a»d ran up the
lash and was actually within three or
four inches of my hand when I flung
the whip from me."— London Standard.
ArrnncinK Chrysanthemums.
In the arrangement of chrysanthe
mums the Japanese guard against sev
en faults. Their stems must uot be of
the same length, a single flower must
not turn its back or present its full
face, the flowers must not be hidden
by leaves, or, should they be arranged
in the way of steps, a full blown flower
should never be placed at the base of
the composition, aud one odd ono must
not be allowed to fall between two
others alike in color. Three flowers
should not appear to form a triangle.

excitable woman.
"Have you been scolding him?"
"Of course I have."
"Ah, I suppose he talked back aud

" "Among tb? North American Indians
t the origin of tJiB use of masks lay,"
s says a writer, "in the desire to conceal
t the emotions. Thus should two war
rriorj meet in combat the mask con-
c ceals any expression, whether or sym-
p pathy, fear or other eaio'tlon. For in-
s stance, the knowledge that fear was
d depicted ou oue's face and that his
a antagonist knew it would very pos-
s silJly Insure tlia defeat of the one
w whose fee'inss were betrayed to the
o other. S a hi religious ceremonies the
o orator wears a mask that he may

tterference or embarrassment, either of

If Men Were Insects.
Out of every five animals in the ani
mal kingdom four are Insects, of which
there are 200.000 species. In a human
world of that sort for every gigantic
man there would be four pygmies and
of tbe pygmies 200,000 distinct races.
These pygmies would be made up of a
head, a middle body and a hind body,
each of which would be composed of
hard, shell-like rings, and because their
bodies were* thus divided or Insected
they might be called insects. Their
legs would grow out of either the mid
dle body or the hind body. They would
breathe through holes in the middle
body and eat, drink, see. smell, with
all kinds of apparatus made for the
purpose in various and often widely
separated parts of the body. If some
of these pygmies were young, weighed
a pound and ate like a silkworm, they
would In two mouths devour forty-five
tons of food. It is scarcely remarkable,
therefore, what millions of grasshop
pers will do to a cornfield or gypsy
moths to an apple orchard.
Polished and Vigorous.
Observing a passenger with the un
lighted butt of a cigar in his fingers,
the street car conductor requested him
to put it out.
"It is out, you chump," responded the
passenger.
"Pardon me," resumed the conductor,
"if I have failed to make myself clear.
The condition to which I had reference
was not one of mere temporary non
combustion, but of elimination, the
eradication, I might say, of the physic
al presence of your nicotine laden rem
nant, this process followed necessarily
by cessation of the odor now permeat
ing an atmosphere already somewhat
deficient, I fear, in the essential ele
ment of ozo«ae. I'm a humble conduct
or, and my aim is to please: but, you
big porcine stiff, you throw that cigar
through the door or I'll throw you and
it both. See?"
"Excuse me, professor," replied tbe
passenger meekly, and the Incident
■was closed.— Philadelphia Ledger.
Court* of Lovp.
"Courts of love" were established In
the middle nges, when chivalry was at
its height and love the serious occupa
tion of life among the higher class of
society. The first "court of love" was
established In the south of France In
the twelfth century aud was composed
of knights, poets and ladies, and their
decisions on subtle questions connected
with affairs of the heart were given
with great formality.

Tail ■• y rand as Cook.
Be a cook — some sort of cook, even a
ship's cook. Remember Talleyrand.
The British authorities gave him twen
ty-four hours' notice to quit London,
and he embarked on a Danish vessel
for America. The vessel was held up
at sea by au English frigate. A
searching party wns sent on board.
Talleyrand pleaded with the captain
not to declare him, as he hud uo liking
for the Tower of London. "I will pass
you off as the ship's cook," said the
officer. "There is nothing else." After
some wry faces the prince consented
and with a very ill grace assumed the
cotton cap, kitchen apron, carviug
knife and other appendages in keeping
with his new office. When the English
officer demanded if there were any
French passengers on board tbe cap
tain replied, '"Yes, one poor devil of a
limping French cook." Belug immedi
ately called up for inspection, Talley
rand made his appearance, saucepan In
hand and with such a piteous counte
nance thnt the Englishman laughed
heartily and consented not to make a
captive of him. — Xew York Press.
Another Triumph of Art.
A young New York artist says that
he was iv Vermont on a sketching trip
ono summer. One day while strolling
along a pretty lane he overtook a par
ticularly picturesque little fellow who
was sauntering along with a fishing
pole on his shoulder and a string of
small fish in his hand. He looked so
rnucii tbe part of tbo small country boy
of poetry and fiction that tbe artist de
cided ho would like to make a sketch
of him, aud after considerable negotia
tion this was arranged for, the lad, In
Accordance with directions, perching
himself on a rail fence. As the artist
worked away at his sketch an old coun
tryman came down the lane and stood
looking over bis shoulder.
"By gum! Thet certainly beats all
hemlock!" the old fellow presently ex
claimed admiringly.
"Like the picture, da you?" the artist
asked, with a pleased flush.
"Oh, 'taint thet, though it ain't so
ba& What I meant was the way you
manage to. keep thet boy quiet so
long."— Xew York Herald.
To Tell a Fnslilonuble Restaurant.
"When I was young," said an old
bachelor, "at all the fashionable res
taurants you wrote your order. That
was the way to distinguish the really
fashionable restaurant. You wrote your
order there, whereas iv the common
one you gave It to the waiter orally.
Ordering is a difficult matter. It is a
thing, especially when one has guests,
that one is likely to get flustered over;
hence I always liked to write my or
der. It kept me cool. But a waiter,
standing over me, suggesting dishes I
didn't want, hurrying me, had the
power to rattle me completely. But
fashionable restaurants no longer are
to be distinguished by this writing
business. Writing has disappeared
from them. They are to be distin
guished now by their French menus
bothersome things that call a sweet
bread a ris de veau, a potpie a vol au
vent and a leg of mutton a gigot."—

WhlcU Was Shotf
There was a Jere Clemens who was
a United States senator aud in his day
enjoyed the usual senatorial fame— a
fame which perishes whether it spring
from four years' service or forty. Aft
er Jere Clemens' fame as a senator
passed away ha was still remembered
for many jean ou account of another
service which he performed. He shot
old John Brown's Governor Wise In
the hind log In a duel. However, I am
not very clear about this. It may bo
that Governor Wise shot him In the
hind leer. However, I don't think It is
important. I think that the only thing
that Is really important is that one of
them got shot in the hind lex. It would
have been better and nobler aud more
historical and satisfactory if both of
them had got shot in tho hind leg. But
It Is of no use for me to try to recol
lect history. I never had a historical
mind. Let It go. Whichever way It
happened, I am glad of it, and that is
as much enthusiasm as I can get up
for a person bearing my name. But I
am forgetting the first Clemens, the
one that stands farthest back toward
the really original first Clemens, which
was Adam.— From Mark Twain's Auto
biography in North American Review.
Woman's Diplomacy
[Original.]
P Providence, who manages all thing!
w wisely au<l economically, wastes no
t talents on man for the management ot '-
w woman. The wisdom of this course Is
t that man needs no such talent until
a alter marriage, and after marriage he
h has a wife to manage other women for
U Uiui. The economy consists in the fact
( (hat men shall marry. A single man
n never appreciates the sensitiveness of |
t the opposite sex. Woman hides her i
w wounds, and man often stamps through
h her feelings with seven league boots. !
A An Incident that occurred to me aft-
e er my marriage taught me this, and
s since then 1 have invariably left the
s settlement of my differences with oth-
e er women to my wife. I had passed
m middle life before marrying. I -had
m met ladies, as other bachelors meet
t them, socially, but my club was my
h home, mid I was never thrown Into Ul
ttimate association with any woman.
B But 1 considered myself sufficiently
m mild mannered -and deferential to the
s softer sex for all ordinary social pur- [
p poses." What wounds I had inflicted I
d did not know, nor was I conscious of
h having iutlicte;! any.
T The honeymoon over, my wife took
mmcm me iv training, aud it soon became ap-
p parent that I needed a great deal of ,
i it. However, in out a year I sup-
p posed I was tharaaij'.iJy educated, \ Ono
d day my wifu informed me that her
d dearest friend, whom she had not seen
s since we had been married, was coin.'
i ing to visit her, and she was especial
lly anxious Hint I should make v good
i impression. I resolved to be ou my
g guard and put on my most affable and
d deferential manner.
T The first evening of Mls3 liluud'3 ar-
r rival my wife, my sister and our guest
s sat down to a g;»me of whist. I was
o of course assigned to play with Miss
B Bland. ' 1 got on swimmingly. I saw
t that my partner knew little of the
g game, and it gave me an opportunity
t to show my wife that I could 'pass
h hep frlpnd's mistakes without the
s slightest reference to them. I would
p probably have gone through the even-
i ing without trespassing on my part-
n ner's feelings had not she made a
m misplay that gave me an opportunity,
a as I thought, to make a brilliant strike
i in soothing her. --"-.;■ '■-'■■
I had a fine long suit, all of which
I could make if I could draw my op-
p ponents' trumps; but. having only four
t trumps myself, all depended upon my
p partner .husbanding hers. My wife
l led a small spade, and I, desiring to
g get the lead, put on the king, When
m my partner played, tho trick was mine.
S She trumped it. I winced, but said
n nothing. My partner's error gave our
o opponents the odd trick.
" I shouldn't have trumped your
t trick, should I?" said Miss Bland, red
ddening.
M My wife explained to her that to
t trump one's partner's trick was not
c considered always the best course, but
t that In this case It didn't matter since
w we were playing for fun.
I didn't see the fun in playing that
w way, but refrained from comment.
" "Now I think of it." said Miss Bland,
m much mortified, "somebody told me
o once that to trump one's partner's trick
w was the worst mistake a player can
m make." '
M My wife looked at me appeallngly to
a any something to make my partner feel ,
e easier, and it was then I tried to soothe
h her. -, '
" "You only trumped my king. There
l ls a worse thing than that," I said
s softly.
" "What is It?" asked Miss Bland.
" "To trump your partner's ace."
M Miss Bland cast a quick glance at
mmc,m me, and I cast a glance at my wife,
e expecting to see approval in her face.
I saw a frown.
T There was an ominous tremor on
M Miss Bland's lip, and presently she
a arose, left the table and went upstairs.
" "Now you've done It," said my wife
a as she left the room to follow her
f friend.
I walked up and down the floor curs
llug myself for a fool and wondering
l lf my wife would be able to explain
m matters and get me out of the scrape.
1 also wondered how she would man-
a age the diplomatic task. Of course she
w would tell Miss Bland— what else could
s sh« tell her?— I had intended my
r remark to make her blunder seem less
a a blunder. But bad I solely so In
ttended it? Women are quick to see a
s slight, and perhaps Miss Bland might
h have detected a truce of sarcasm in
m my voice. "Thank heaven," I mut
ttered, "it's woman against woman.
l l'm sure the more I excused myself
t the worse I would make the matter."
M My wife returned, but without her
friend.
" Well?" I asked eagerly.
" "She's coming down presently, after
s she's got rid of the appearance of
t tears."
" "Tears?"
" "Of course. Do you suppose her feel
iings ore sheet iron?" Then, seeing the
p pain she was indicting on me, she add-
e ed, "It's all right now."
" "Did you tell her I intended"—
" "Nonsense! I told her nothing of
y your intentions."
. . "What did you tell her?"
" "Why, I told her that you had been
n bachelor all your life, had lived at
d dubs ami ail that and hadn't been used
t to playing cards with women— in short,
t that"—
" I didn't now any better."
" "Yes."
" "And it made her feel nil right?"
" "Yes."
" "My love," I exclaimed, folding her
l ln an embrace, "you're a brick. Yon
c can bent me at diplomacy every time."
M Miss Bland came down, and the
g game proceeded. She and I became
f fast friends. ALEXANDER ELY.
