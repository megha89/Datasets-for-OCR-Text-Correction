JACKSON DENNIS
CONVICTED
(Jets Eiahteen Months In San Quen.
tin for Embezzlement.
Other Cases to be Dismissed.
On Saturday tbe district attornoy
with the cashinr, P. Dabovicb, on
tbe stand, endeavored to Introduce a
note signed by defendant, tor 8150 C,
whU;h whh found among the assets of
tbe bank, for the purposo of showing
tbat defendant was indebted to the
bank, intending to offset any unpaid
balance due on salary account. As
tbe witness was unable to lind any
entry in tbe books of tbe bank In re
lation this note, tbe oourt adjourned
until Monday, so that tbo prosecu
tion might look over the records, and
ascertain if any entry had been made.
On Monday, the witness said an
entry was mode of a note on' August
1; 1907, for 87500 given by A. Klls
worth. On that date this particular
note way placed .in the bank, and
other Bu'juriUes taken out, tho de
fendant being present at the time.
Defendant handed it to him hh cash
ier, and it was in the same condition
an when leoeivcd. Note admitted. -
Witness testified that defendant's
account with Sutter Creek State Bank
whs not charged with tins ..note.
No separate account was kept showing
salaries paid to employe, but entered
every payment on this account' in
mini! book. The transfer may* have
boon made at the instance and sug
gestion of state bank commissioners.
It was due one yoar atter date; : did
□ot know whether tbe maker, A.
Ellsworth, was good for tbe amount
or not. Could not say when the in
dorsement ''was made. Defendant
never promised to pay tbe note before
it was due; he was never asked to do
so. The bank was never examined by
the bank commissioner from the
time the note was taken until the
closing of tbe bank. Wben the com
missioners examined tbe bank in
July, 1907, they objected to , the ex
pense account being too large, and
also to tbe amount of notes of the
Atlas Supply Company. The com-"
missioners tbat visited tbe bank at
bat time were Mr tilackstook and Mr
Sherer. Prosecution rests.
All testimony given Saturday in re
gard to tbe 81500 draft, was ordered
stricken out, also in regard to note
ot 87500 giveu by Atlas Construction
and Supply Co.
Tbo defense moved to strike cut
about all tbe testimony tbat had been
introduced in tbe case. Ail motions
in that line were denied, except as to
the SISOO note of W. O. Manscu, and
tbe §7500 note of Atlas Supply Com
pany, the first named not being
entered upou the records of the bank,
and the latter not being due, as It
was dated June '20, 11)07, and matured
one year after date.
P. Uabovich testified on behalf of
defendant that k\ N. Soracco was
vice-nrosident of tbe bunk, and held
that otUae until the closing of tbe
institution, tbat be sold bis stock to
dofendant on tbe 28th of January,
1908, but on the rocords ho was vice
president, and hud not tendered his
resignation.
C. Li. Uulbort, manager and cashier
of the Jiank of Amador county, suid
be believed Fred Uabb wae worth 8500
over oil liabilities in July, l!)0(>, and
at all times since thai: date.
Fred Kudev also tostified as to
responsibility of Itabb for 8500. "
Mrs Frances Dennis, wife of de
fendant, stated Unit she was a de
positor in tbe Sutter Cieek Hank,
and interested in the Dennis Manu
facturing Company, which wus ulso
a depositor in tho bank.
By Wigs Pro vis was sought to prove
that Jaokeon Dennis and thoso com
prising the Dennis Manufacturing
Company bad by certain documents,
turned ove<' to the depositors nssooia
thin curtain claims and property for
tho benefit of tbe depositotu. Ob
jection was Hindu and testimony on
this line was ruled out. Tbe defonse
closed without putting the defendant
ou tbe stand.
Tim arguments wore commenced
juat before noon Monday. After tho
opening by the district attorney,
Homer W. Wood followed for the de
fense, and It. 0. Bole closed ou that
side the same afternoon. Tuseduy
morning district attorney Viniui,
closed tor the prosecution. The court
instructed the jury us tv tbe Jaw
bearing on tbe cusp, giving ninny in
structions specially asked by tbe de
fense, as well nB iustruotious of its
own motiou. These were cold Jaw
governing tbe case,
The jury retired tor deliberation
just before noon.
The jury was out about two hours
and a half. At live minutes to two
o'clock they auuouuued they bad
ngreed upon n vnnllot, nnd upon tbo
reassembling of the uourt n veidlot of
guilty na charged wna returned. It la
said that, live bnllots were tnken lie

Embezzlement la punishable by Im
prisonment la tbe state prison not

Tim defendant keenly r«lt the foice
of the verdict. Mrs Dennis was also
gteatly ORitatod at tbe ontoome, nnd
It is thought tbo oaee will be takeu
on appeal to the higher court.
Tbe evidence trotn beginning to end
revoHled n iotten state of alfnirs from
tho organization to the closo of tbe
Sutter I Iron k Htate liank. Tho wild
cat speoulations entered upon, and
the looso motbods generally no doubt
hnd weight with tbo jurors.
Thn result was hardly looked for by
many who bad watched tbe crso, but
no otbor opinion exists than the
attairs of the bank were criminally
mismanaged from boginning to end. j
Tbe defendant for forty years baa
been identified with tbe business
mterosts of Sutter Creek. lie was
of an' energetic spirit, and promoted
tbe construction of tbe railroad from
lone to Martell, staying with thai;
project until it became an nccoin
plished fact. After removing to
Niles, be devoted lur, enorgies in
starting a number of manufacturing
schemes in that; town, and tbe sup
position is that tbo funds In tbo
riuttor Creek bank wore drawn upon
heavily in carryng out the various''
projeots at Niles. tie was much of a
plunger in finance, and conservative
and sate banking was an untrodden
path to him.
March 2!)f,u was then fixed aa tbe
time tor passing sentence. Tbe de
fendant's counsel requested a suf
ficient period to enable them to pre
pare tbeir statement ou motion for a
new trial. H. W. Wood, one of tbe
defendant's counsels, left for the city
Tuesday morning, leaving tbe local
attorney to attend to the, closing tot
the case. - . ■ • ■ • *S$
Yesterday morning tbe program ot
tbo defense was changed. The de
fendant with his attorney, R. C. liolo,
appeared in oourt and waived time in
pussing sentence, ' asked that judg
ment of tbe court be 'pronounced
forthwith.
The defendant was placed upon tho
stand and made a statement, to the
effect that be desired to throw liini
selt upon tlin mercy of thn court, and
would forego an appeal to tho higher
court, lie bad been a resident of
Sutter Creek nearly all his life, and
in business in that town. That people
began to confide their money to his
charge, and two Elites were tilled with
idle money in this way. From tbiß
be conceived tbe idea ot starting a
bank, lie bud branched out into
different lines in using this money,
but disclaimed any intention of act
ing dishonestly, always believing that
tnu various enterprises would turn
out remunerative.
Judge Wood, taking everything into
consideration, sentenced the defend
ant to imprisonment in the state
prison at Hun Queutiu for v period of
eigtheeu months.
It is understood that tbe other
charges against tbe dofendant will bo
dismissed. Sheriff tirogory will tako
tbe prisoner to Sun Quentin within
a few diiyß. With credits for good be
havior, tbe actual timu to be served
will be fifteen months.
This ending ot these cases appears
tv be SBtisfantory. The law has boon
vindicated. Ainador oouuty jury has
shown its disapproval ot tbe criminal
methods in the conduct of the Sulfur
Crook Stain Dank. While the verdict
of "guilty as charged," came aa a
surprise to nearly everyone who bad
followed tbe trial of tbe case, thorn
was no diversity of sentiment on the
point that tbe defendant ought to bo
puuißhod for the reckless use of tho
Imtik fuuda, and his banking methods
generally. Tho evidence presented
in support of tho embezzlement
churgo whh extremely weak, render
ing the outcome of v motion for v
new trial on an appeal vory doubtful.
lijwiilo which, an apptrnl or a new
trial, would have entailed at least
$5(10 additional expeuso upou the
county, and m the event of soouriug
v new trial, over n yoar must have
elapsed before tho new triul would
have honn bad. So as rogurdn tlinu,
defendant is bettor olf by starting
in to H.irvo ■ tbe sentence at onue. It
t:\\i**, bo noted that this is the first
criminal trial in eoveutoou years
whore tho jurors were allowed to
ueparatu during the progress of tho
trial. Whatever ueoessity existed at

To Abolish Library Fund.
A petition is being circulated in
this city praying tbe city trustees to
abolish tbe library tax, which bas
been imposed for several years past,
and which the trustees themselves
are now anxious to get rid of. Tbe
history of thia matter is an instance
of tbe unwisdom of hasty legislation.
Tbo object aimed at was to corral a
SlO.OOOgift from A. Carnegie for the
erection of a public library. At tbe
first blusb, it was deemed a fine thing
to have that amount of money spent
in a substantial improvement. Tbe
conditions attached to the gift were
not considered, and when these were
discussod it placed an entirely differ
ent phase upon the quectiou. It was
ascertained tbat tbe city would bave
to provide a lot upon which to erect
tho building, and thereafter provide
at least 81000 annually for its sup
port. Tho Ledger pointed out at tbo
time that the conditions here were
unfavorable for such a move. The
populntiou being largely composed of
the non-English speaking class, to
whom v library would be no benefit
whatever; that the free library from
the stute was amply sufllcieut to
satisfy tbe public appetite for road
ing mutter; that to raise tho necessury
SIUOO annually would entail v tax of
nearly '20 cents ou each 8100 of pro
perty. Tho ardor for c public library
has waned to below zero, and tbe
question before the authorities bus
boon to crawl out of the dilemma,
and transfer tbe money raised for a
library fund to other directions,
lleuoe thn petition now in circulation
to abolish the tax and repeal the
ordinance under which it whs impos
ed. The petition must be siguod by
not less than one-third of the voters.
Thore will bo no trouble in getting
tin necessary siguaturoH. It will pro
bably be presented to tbo trustees fur
action ul tbe next rcgulur monthly
meeting.

The proposition to bond the state for the sum of eighteen
million dollars for the construction of state highways has
received favorable consideration in the legislature. The
question will 110 doubt be submitted for final disposal to the
voters at the next general election. The administration
S views the scheme as a step in the right direction, but it is
very doubtful if a sufficient number of voters can be induc
ed to take a similar view. While the state's credit is behind
the bonds, the actual payment of the principal aud interest
will be allotcd to the counties through which these roads
run, pro rata, according to the amount expended in each
county. This looks to be a shrewd plan to capture the
favorable vote of the populous cities. Naturally in these
cities, where model roads already exist-, in comparison with
which the outlying counties, with all the vast sum of
eighteen millions scattered over the entire state, could not
hope to compete, nothing of this bond fund would be spent.
They Have money enough to construct and take care of their
own roads, and are asking nothing from the state at large.
But their vote will be the deciding factor in the bond election.
If better roads are to be constructed throughout the stale,
naturally the big cities will be beuifitted by the better travel
ing facilities thereby afforded. And if cost of construction
and payment of interest is borne by interior counties, and no
portion thereof upon the big cities, why the reasonable con
clusion is that the vote of such cities will be thrown almost
solidly in favor of the bonds. Such an immense debt would
entail no burden of taxation upon them. On the other hand,
if the burden of repayment were thrown also upon them, ac
cording to assessment value of property, they would have to
pungle up the bulk of the money for principal and interest,
and hence would bury the proposition under an avalanche of
adverse votes. Herein lies the 'danger of this measure as we
look at it. The' interior is to mulcted in a heavy indebted
ness for boulevards for the residents of San Francisco and
other populous centers. If we have correctly gauged the
distribution of the bonded indebtedness, we believe as the
election time comes on this scheme will rouse the voters
throughout the state to a point pro and con that has rarely
been equaled in the history of Californa.
Governor Gillett has vetoed the bill intended to repeal the
law requiring the counties to pay the sum of $132 per
annum for the support of every boy or girl sent from their
respective counties to the lone or Whittier reform schools.
There is too much of this spirit to palm off the financial
burden of such matters upon the state treasury, thereby re
lieving those who ought and are able to bear the cost. As
the law has been for years, while the county from which an
unruly boy or girl is sent to the reform school pays the above
cost of maintenance, the parent or guardian of the child is
required to pay the county if financially able to do so. This
provision has a wholesome effect in curbing the tendency of
foisting upon the public the cost of these wayward boys and
girls, and of keeping the population of these reformatories
within reasonable bounds. It is an entirely mistaken notion
that by putting the cost upon the state th.c various counties
are thereby relieved of any financial burden. The result is
practically the same, whether the support of reformatories
comes from the state treasury solely, or whether a part is
thrown upon the county treasuries, with this significant
difference, that when the state alone is chargeable, the num
ber of commitments to these institutions is apt to increase at
an alarming rate, under the false notion that it makes no
difference to the counties whether the commitments be large
or small.
To put the local license on the top notch for repressive
purposes is a harmful policy for any town or county. A
reasonable license for transient business enterprises, that
come here perhaps once a year, is necessary for regulation
and revenue. But there is no reason in trying to hold them
up for all the traffic will bear. Sometimes the parties interest
ed conclude that it is more than their business can stand,
and give the town the go-by. This was illustrated this week.
Posters were put up around the city announcing that the
Adams circus would show here Tuesday afternoon and even
ing. It is no doubt a small affair, and would not prove much
of a drawing card like the Norris circus and other large con
cerns. But when the advance agent discovered that the
license fees were $25 per day, and $5 extra for every side
show where au additional admission price is charged he was
dubious about the outcome, and concluded to report to the
managers before paying the tax. Ths license tax is not
graded. A small show in the nature of a circus is placed in
the same category as a big menagerie, and the same sum de
manded for the privliege of showing. A circus of any kind
helps business, and their coming should be encouraged
rather than otherwise for that reason. It is a mistaken idea
that because such shows often gather in n good harvest of
coiu from the people of a city or county, that therefore they
should be discouraged by a exorbitant license.

A VISION ON THE VELDT.
The Form on tho Rocks That Con-
fronted the Soldier.
I thought I saw a form of some kind
between the bowlders. I Jumped to
the conclusion that it was a soldier. In
one second it had •vanished. 1 chal
lenged, but got no answer. . Those
pieces of rock seemed to terrify me.
I advanced toward them, but saw
nothing. I retired back and took up
my position, leaning on ray rifle. My
eyes went again to the same place, and
there, standing between the two bowl
ders, was the outline of a woman. I
brought my rifle to the present, cover
ins the form which stood before me.
I saw her walk from one piece of rock
to the other.
I watched and saw her repeat her ac
tion. She then stopped and leaned up
against one of the bowlders with her
back toward me. I again advanced
to where she stood. When I had got to
within forty or fifty yards of her I
saw her turn round and look straight
•at me with a careworn and sorrowful
face.
Then I saw and knew who she was.
It was my own mother. I was not mis
taken, for she walked within a few
yards of me, at the same time looking
me dead in the face. She then turned
about aud walked to the two pieces of
rock, and I saw no more of her. About
three weeks after I received a letter
from home telling 1110 of her death and
burial.— "A Grenadier's South African
Reminiscence" in Occult Iteview.
Gambling For Maids.
•"Many queer reasons are advanced
fay servant girls for losing a place."
said the manager of the employment
bureau, "but the queerest I have ever
heard was given by a girl who blew
in here last week. Her late mistress
was a bridge fiend. One day for the
want of money to bet she and her
friends plaj-ed with their maids for
stakes. At the end of the game each
woman considered herself in honor
bound to stick to her agreement, and
an attempt was really made to swap
servants according to tho ups and
downs of the game. Some of the girls
thus raffled off changed places willing
ly enough, but that client of mine re
fused to be swapped and hustled
around hunting a new job."— New York

Rough on His Lordship.
A carpenter in an English town hav
ing neglected to make a gibbet that
had been ordered by the hangman on
the ground that he had not been paid
for the last one he had erected gave so
much offense that the next time the
judge came to the circuit he was sent
for.
"Fellow," said the judge in a stern
tone, "how came you to neglect mak
ing the gibbet that was ordered on my
account?"
"I humbly beg your pardon," replied
the carpenter. "Had I known it was
for your lordship It would havo been
done Immediately."
The Wave of Indulgence.
Indulgence nowadays Is very much
exaggerated. We have even come to
admire clever thieves, and us long as
we aro not tho victims of the theft we
are quite enthusiastic for the rogue
who shows great cunning and daring
in his crimes. lie is almost a hero In
our eyes, and we call blm a genius.—

FROM OUR
CORRESPONDENTS
AUKUM.
March U— Ezra Taylor had tho mis
fortune to lose a valuable horse by a
runaway last Sunday. His son was
drlring tbo horse when it took lrlgbt,
and ran away. It ran for about half
a mile, breaking the buggy up to
some extent only, aud breaking the
horse's leg, which caused Mr Taylor
to shoot him tbo next day.
It is reported that Wm. Cm lor, who
has a ranch nenr this place, has trad
ed it for real estate near Florin.
Henry and Louie Seeley have put

creek just above the Mills place, and
ore crushing rook from the Helm
mine
Mr tmcl Mrs Prod Sohroeder came
over from Oleta today and proceeded
on to Unti, whore Mrs Scbroedor goes
to consult Dr. Saunders ns to her
health.
A tlook of sandhill ctanes passed
over these parts Friday, going north.
As heretofore they have acted as a
sort of burometer foretelling dry
weather. If tbe birds are not wrong
and we not wrong iv their estimation
we may look for a spell of dry
weather, but as tbis is probably an
old woman's superstition, they may
turn out false prophets after all.
An old woman close here loaned a
preacher her borse and buggy and
"hoofed" it homo. Verily, there is
much zeal in some people that sao
religeous folks would marvel at.
But such is life on tbe wide, wide sea,
Where billows roll eternally.

lines. The horses, however, continu
ed to run. Peek was thrown to the
ground, and was dragged a distance
of fifty or sixty feet, still clinging
to tbe linea. He waa dragged agaiust
a rock in the road, striking his head,
und was stunned, causing him tn let
go of tbe reins. The wheels of the
wagon passed 'over bis chest, uud
also over one foot. He was brought
homo aa soon as possible atter tbo
ooourreuoe, aud attended by Dr.
Kndicott. It was found that two ribs
over tbe lungs on the left side weie
fractured, and the left foot hurt, pro
babiy by tbe wagon wheel passing
over it. and other less serious in
juries in various parts ot his body.
Whether he had sustained internal
injuries could not be ancertalned for

In Memoriam.
'. To the ollicers and members ot tbe
Amador County Association: —
We, your committee appointed to
draft suitable resolutions ot respect,
to the memory of our esteemed de
ceused companion, David Kipley
Miller, beg luuvn to submit tbe
following, as our report:
David Kipley Miller was born in
Newoomers Town, Tuscarrawas county
Ohio, Sept. 10, 1831. Came to Cali
fornia, via Panama, iv 1853, and first
settled in Mud Springs, which is
now El Dorado, Xl Dorudo county,
where be worked at bis tinde of
blacksmitbing, and did some placer
mining, as was the custom of all
early comers to the Golden State.
In 1855 Air Miller went to Drytown,
Amador county, and started a hlack
smith aud wagon making establish
ment. At this business ho did well,
and, being a very prudent man, soon
found himself in good lluanoiul con
dition.
Ou July 2, 18U0, tie wua married to
Misa Julia J. liiuksou, who with her
parents, Mr aud xMrs A. id. tlinkson,
came across the plums fiom Missouri,
uud Hettled in Drytown, in 181' J.
Mr Miller remained in Drytown and
Amador City until 1881, when he dis
posed of bis business, and went to
A t water j Merced couuty, and engaged
in raising wheat, aud fiuit. Ho laid
out, aud started the first peach
orchard in Atwater. He remained
there until 1901, when he sold most
of his holdings, aud bought v com
fortable home at 1181, iJIJrd street,
Kast Oakland, where he passed away
on the (ith of January tbia year.
Besides his wife, with whom he has
happily lived for nearly forty-nine
years, be leaves a family of three
duughtois aud two sons to mourn bis
loss, his children are, Mrs Edith
Layton, of Kureku, Cal.; Mrs Edna
Foster, of San Francisco; Mrs Julia
Pearson, Grant D. Miller and Harry
H. Miller, all of East Oakland.
David Kipley Miller, was one of
the stauuuh upright men of Amador
county. He commanded the respect
and esteem of all who knew him, and
in business bis word was his bond.
He claimed membership to no parti
cular church, but was a firm believer
in all Christian endeavors, and waa
always ono of those who promoted
religious beliefa. tie was an earnest
temperance worker, and one ot the
active members of old "Ironclad"
lodge of Good Templars ot Drytown.
Theiefore be it resolved, That In

supplied in furtilizurs for ceronls,
potatoes, bouts and leguminous crops.
l<or trial he selected kalnit, or Stuss
futt potnsii salt, containing 11 por
cunt nf magnesium suiphato. The
KiHiilt confirmed tho theory, and tho
yiold of sugar beets was increased
4,500 pounds per acre, that of grains
lrom ouo-sevouth to ono-tifth of tho
total crop, thai; of potatoes vvns taisod
from 21.000 to '27,000 per ficro, and
that of liny from natural nieudow land
was increased from If. ooo to 4,150
pounds per aero. The potatoes wore
rendered immune to tbo attneka of
the mildew fuugus, which infested
tho part of the Held receiving, no
kainit.
The efficiency of furnauns of vari
ous kinds has been investigated by J.
W. Hull, a liritisb motalurgist. Tho
greatest efUoioncy in ordinary work
was found in tbo use of an JKuglisb
blast-furnace making pig-iron, not
less than 81.7 per cent of tho heat
given by the fuel being utilized, but
05.3 per cent escaped from the fur
naoe and was recovered outsido. A
puddling furnace not titled to a
boiler wasted 91 per cent of the heat.
Tho most wasteful furnace of all,
however, was proven to be the com
mon coke crucible furnace employed
in making steel, as this uses only 1.43
per cent of tbo heat, 03.57 per cent
being lost. -
Tests of Manila ropes supplied tho
linitod States by the American Manu
facturing Co. have shown a strength
of 1,310 pounds for the % inch; 4.150
pounds-for the y2y 2 inch; 0,750 for the
% mob; aud 10,400 for tho 1 inch.
Hit) specifications hud called tor
strengths of 1,200, 2,500. 5,000 and
7,800 pounds respectively.
Tho movable canal lock ot Ciiuseppe
liartolomoi, an Italian eugiueer,solves
the old problem of climbing grades
by boat, in a novel aud appareuly
improved way. It ia adaptod for in
clined uauuls baring amplo water
supply, ami consists essentially of a
puddle wheel plucod across and tilling
tbe section of tho canal, with its
axis resting on rails extending along
tho canal walls. '.I. ho whoel is raised
so that a slightly Jess quantity of
water encapes under it than enters
the cauul. This oauses a backing up
and raising of tbe water, and as a
suitable bead is reached tho wheel is
unlocked, aud is turned by tne water
behind it, thus traveling up stream
along tbo rails and holding back
water enough to lluat the boats being
pushed through tbe canal. For mak
ing tbe descent a separate canal is
desirable. A truck is so arranged
that the axle of the water wheel may
be slightly raised and rested on two
of tbe four wheeld of the truck, thus
reversing tho direction of travel, al
tbougU tbe paddles revolve in the
same nay as in making the ascent.
Uu au experimental canal 80 feet long
and 14 Inches wide this form of look
worked satisfactorily on Inclines of
11, 4 aud 5 per cent.
The "rudio-nutomiitiu torpedo" of
Gustavo (Jabot, lately tried at (Jbalcn-

wireless control over a wide iauge.

I'robably the oldest steam eugiue in

"As long ago as 1 can remomber my

of Chamberlain's Cough Remedy, but
never in my life have 1 realized its
true value until now," writes Prof.

night of February 3rd our baby was
taken sick with a very severe cold;
tho uext dny was worse and the fol
lowing night his condition was cies
perate. lie could not lie down and
it was necessary to have him in the
arms evory moment. Kven then his
breathing wan difficult. 1 did not
think he would live until morning.
At last I thought of my mother's
remedy, Chamberlain's Cough ltetn
edy, which wo gave, and it alfordod

His Own Story of a Wonderful Opera-
tion He Performed.
Mr. Waltaf is. tiarria in his account
of a Journey to Tnfik-t tells the story
of a wonderful operation In surgery
ha it wiva reported to him by « native
doctor who was traveling in his coin
patty i
"1 tbfnft tho old man fancied that. I
doubted hla filclll. At lertar. li« was fil
v.isj:! holding forth upon the subject
in.ii continually repeating the story
that when in Algeria he bad been of*
fcrcd n fabulous salary— the; cum va
ried ('ncli time the tflW was told-*tp ro«
r.iahi In charge of tho military hc;;
plinl nt Algiers, uu honor which he
hnd c!cc!t!i?U,
"He never tired of narrating the
facts and details of his most Ruccos-r,
fni operation. There la n sect In Mn
rocco called Hntnacha, who are fol
lowers of n certain saint bflrjed near
Ik'klncz. These devotees umufo their
audience— and themselves, too, lot us
hope— by throwing lnlo the air heavy
caution balls, which they allow to fall
upon their shaven crowns. On the oc
casion in question a Ratndtlßhl had
unfortunately boon wanting In roli
glous power, for the cannon ball
crushed bis skull.
"My old sbereef friend had been call
ed to the rescue. According to his ac
count, ho removed th<> broken patch
of BkuJl, replacing It with the rind of
;i green pumpkin, and closed the ski'i
over it. In a month's time, he unid,
the putient was not only convalescent,
but was ouce more hard nt work prac

THE SILVER FOX.
He Is a Giorivicd Freak of the Red
Fox Breed.
Only those -wise In tho woodlogp of
tho north cm fully know the magic In
the name silver fox. The Oliver fox is
not of different kind, but a glorified
froak of the red race. Ills parents may
have been the commonest kind of red
foxes, yet nature in extravagant mood
may have showered all her gifts on
this favored one of tho offspring nnd
not only clad him in a marvelous coat,
but gifted him with speed and wind
and brains above bis kind to guard his
perilous wealth. And need he^has of
all such power, for this exquisite robe
Is so mellow rich, so wonderful In
style, with Its gloss black and delicate
frosting, that it is tho most desirable,
the most precious of nil furs, worth
many times Its weight in gold, the no
blost peltry known to man. It is the
proper robe of kings, the nppanage of
groat imperial thrones today, as was
tho tyrlan purple In the days of Rome.
This Is indeed the hunter's highest
prize, but co guarded by the cunning
brain and the -wind and limb of the
beast himself that it is through rare
good luck more than hunter skill that
a few of these fur jewels are taken
each year In tho woods.
There aro degrees of rank among
these putrlcians. They range In qual
ity even as diamonds range, nnd the
hunters have a jargon of their own to
express all shades between tho cross
and tho finest silver black.— Ernest
Thompson Seton in Century Magazine.

that food has a potent influence iii
determining character? 1 ' asked Mr.
Smltutield sis be put three lumps of
sugar in his coffee.
"I guess It's all right," replied I.lr.
Wood as he severed a portion of his
beefsteak. "It always seems a little
cannibalistic to me when you order
lobster."
"Well," retorted Mr. Smithfleld good
humoredly, "I ought to have known
it was dangerous to lend you money
after I discovered your fondness for
beets. But, seriously, if there were
anything in the theory, wouldn't it
make a man sheepish to eat mutton?"
"It would, and prize fighters ought
to restrict themselves to n diet of
scraps."
All In the Mind.
On tho opening day of one winter
session the late Professor Talt of Edin
burgh university entered the natural
philosophy class room In the midst of
the uproarious applause common to
those occasions.
Presently he looked up at the tumul
tuous benches above him with the
smile of one who bad known the ways
of students for a lifetime. At last,
when a momentary lull came, he re
marked, his gray eyes twinkling:
"Gentlemen, I must remind you
that there Is really no such thing as
noise. It is merely a matter of sub
jcctlvo Impression."
No Flies on Him.
Two Irishmen, just landed, stopped
at a private boarding house on ono hot
July night. Retiring early, they left
the window open nnd tho light burn
ing brightly. The mosquitoes swarm
ed into the* room and began biting.
Miko, awakening, callod to Tat to
put out tho light. Pat got up and put
It out nnd crawled back to bed again.
Pat awoke nbout an hour later nnd
found tho room full of fireflies nnd
eald: "It's no use. Mike. They are
coming In with lanterns!"
Plossure Tripe.
"Goliik to tho north polo is no plens

"Woll." answered tbe turtle explorer,
"it reminds me somewhat of the aver

CITY, OFFICIAL PAPER.
FRIDAY ....MARCH 19, 1909
LOCAL EDITORIAL COLUMN.
The job printers of the United States are taking faction to
protest against a gross injustice on the part of the govern
ment of the United States, which has been going on for
many years, in furnishing printed stamped envelopes at a
price but a fraction above cost. Any individual or bnsiness
firm can get through any local post office a quantity ; of
stamped envelopes with the address of the individual or' firm
printed thereon for a trifle above what the stamps and stock
without printing would cost the printer. The government
reaps no profit from this business, but the local post masters
are allowed a per cantage which leaves the government out
of pocket to the tune for about a quarter of a million dollars
each year on this envelope busiuess. The printed envelopes
are delivered to the customer free of transportation charges,
while the cost to the government of carrying second class
matter is estimated on an average at over 8 cents per
pound. It is utterly impossible for printers to compete with
such methods. It is calculated that 20,000 printing offices
throughout the United States are robbed by this unjust
competition of $100 per year each. At this rate the business
transacted by Uncle Sam in running opposition to the
printers of the country amounts to $2,000,000, and the only
ones to reap any benefit are the local postmasters who take
the orders. According to ths best iuformation obtainable
the government receives less than 50 cents per thousand
without reckoning the postage stamps of course, a,nd this in.
eludes the delivery to the printing office in Dayton, Ohio,
where this envelope printing factory is established, and de
livery afterwards to the customers. Whatever else is collect
ed goes into the pockets of the middle men. »And while this
glaringly unjust competition is going, on the postoffice de
partment is overtaxed and running behind in the trans,
mission of second-class matter. No wonder. If it entered
into competition in other lines of trade there would be a
great howl made thereat. The printers have beeu com
paratively silent en this question so far, but now they are
waking up. Every printer should send a protest to the
congressman. and senators and request that decisive steps be
taken to stop this abuse.
Senator Holohan's bill to* remove from the ballot the
"straight ticket" circle was defeated by a vote in the senate
of 13 to 27. The democrats, including Caminetti, lined up
pretty solidly in favor of doing away with straight party de
vice. Of course the straight circle helps the party of the
majority, although perfectly fair to all parties. There is no
harm in that device, and republicans will be glad that it is
retained.

THE GOLD OF
SOUTH AFRICA.
Last Year the Output of the
Transvaal Mines was $130,
000.000.
(Johniinnflliiiry Correspondence of
the Kansas City Jonrnnl.)
Tnuo out your wntob. hold it to
your ear and listen to the ticks. For
every one of thorn 31 worth ot yellow
gold la noiv coining out of the groat
mines' tiurier my ieot. Tbnt Is tbo
measure ot the stronm, and it goes
on eeooud after second, miiiiiln after
minute, hoar after hour, day and
night,, all tbo yonr throngb. The
steady output of the gold mines of
the Hand is now Si per neooud, 8210
per minute, more than 814,000 per
hour and prer 8300,000 per day. In
lUO7 the product was moro than 51.10,-
000,000,» or more than 811,000,000,
worth of the yellow motal every
month.
In all history there tins beon no
suob golden flood as that which, la
now pouring forth from the Trans
vaal. The mines of indni, of Croe
sus and of Solomon were as nothing
beside it. Tbo treasures of Mexico
and Peril in the times of Cortnz and
LMzarro dwindle in comparison, and
Australia, Alaska and California have
faad^notblng' like unto. this. The
mines ofthu.Hand are now produo
uig more than one-fourth of all the
new gold in 'the world. They were
discovered only a little more than
twenty' 1 - yearj9' 'ago, and they have
already turned out more than 81,000,-
OUO.OOO .w'orlb\\ot hulliou. This is
equal to one-twelfth of all the gold
from the mines, of all the world since
Colnn>bus,\dißoovered America, in
weight it i&Vjust about 2.000 tons, or
go much that if you loaded it on two
borse wagons at a ton to the wagon it
would take a line of teams twelve or
fifteen milea long to carry it all.
More than tbis.these mines promise
to cbntinue pouring out gold for
generations to come. Tbey could pro
duce twice as much today if tbey had
the labor, and tbey could treble that
amount and keep tbe mines going for
years. The gold reeds, in which the
precious metal lies, have been proved
for a length of more tban sixty miles,
and experts say that they can lie
worked to a depth of (3.000 feet. 11
they were worked to 4,000, the
amount ec far taken out would be just
about :i per pent of the whole, and at
that rate there are from 10,000,000,000
to .15,000,000,000 of the preoious
bullion left. '
'lhe production has been increasing
by leaps and bounda ever since gold
was discovered here. In 1884 tbe out
nut was about 850,000, and ten years
later it had jumped to 8118, 000.000 per
annum. It steadily increased to about
880,000,000 which was the annual
product at the beginning of the JJoer
war. It then fell to almost nothing
for a year or so, but in 1901 it was
again 1880,000,000. in 1905 it reached
8100,000,000; in lUOO it was more than
8120,000,000, and in 1907 the vast sum
of 8130,750,000/ These amounts are
inconceivable, 'but tbey are about
wbat the mine? are producing to-day.
Tbe aggregate ' dividends last year
wero S;io,OQ0,O00, and tbe mines whicb
paid tbenY'are capitalized at over
8120,000,00o! '1 have before me v
newspaper which gives the Droducts
of a dozen of tbe leading mining
companies during the past mouth,
None of them has paid iesa than
87,500 for every day of that month,
and some have run as 'high as 815,000
per day fbi tbe thirty days. Talk
about gold. Where will you ilnd it
elsowh'ero as here?
