Republican Ticket
We take this opportunity of giving
a brief sketch of the candidates on the
republican side who are asking the
suffrages of the voters. We can truly
say that the party never presented to
the voters such a list of candidates as
in this campaign. There is not a
weak or vulnerable spot in the ticket.
Every aspirant is physically, intel
lectually, morally and by training
fully equipped for the duties of the
office to which he aspires. Every re
publican voter can cast his ballot for
every candidate on his ticket with the
utmost confidence that the county's
business will be faithfully attended to
in the event of their election.
Judge Fred V. Wood
Present incumbent and republican
candidate for judge of the superior
court, has been a resident of Amador
county for nearly two years. He was
appointed by governor Gillett to fill
the vacancy on the superior bench
caused by the death of Judge R. C.
Rust. He came among us a stranger
to our citizens, but by his ability and
fairness as a judge, and his affable
and genial ways toward all, he has
gained the esteem of the people
generally, irrespective of partisanship.
He is a native of Wisconsin, 40 years
of age. He has been a resident of
California fdr about 20 years. For
six years he was police judge of the
city of Oakland, a position which he
filled so satisfactorily that the last
term he served he was elected as an
independent candidate, winning by a
big margin over the regular party
nominees. One of his first acts upon
his appointment to preside over the
superior court of Amador, was to be
come identified with the county as a
permanent resident by the purchase of
a home on ! Broadway— the residence
of the late Judge Rust— for himself
and family, which consists of wife
and one son. He is recognized as one
of the ablest and most conscientious
judges in the state, and this is evi
denced by the frequent calls to pre
side in cases in outside counties.
That he will be retained in the posi
tion he has filled so well, and that too
by a heavy ; majority, is beyond
question.
W. G. Snyder
The nominee for district attorney,
is one of the rising lawyers of Amador
county. He is a native of California.
32 year 3of age. He has been practic
ing his profession in Jackson for the
past live yars, and is steadily
gaining standing as one of the ablest
and most reliable attorneys in the
county. The district attorney's office
is second to none hi importance in the
administration of county affairs. It
requires a man of sound judgment, of
mental poise under all circumstances;
one whose sense of right and duty is
not subject ta the influence of par
tisanship, prejudice or passion; one
whose respect for law rises above all
personal considerations. The most de
plorable results are bound to follow
where the legal adviser, whether from
wilfulness or lack of discernment, is
weak in any respect for this office. In
Mr Synder the county will have a
man who will hew to the line ; keeping
ever in view fhe fundamental prin
ciple of equal rights for all, special
favors for none.
Without any disparagement to the
opposing candidate, we believe the
people are alive to the situation, and
will elect W. G. Snyder to look after
the legal business of the county for
the next four years.
John S. Davis
Candidate- for sheriff and tax col
lector is a native of Amador county,
38 years old. He is a blacksmith by
trade and has conducted the smithery
at Amador City for several years.
His father, J. J. Davis of Shenandoah
valley, is a pioneer of the northern
part of the county, and was one of the
organizers of the republican party in
Amador county in the days preceding
the election of Lincoln. He is in
every way fitted for the duties of
sheriff; of strong physique, robust
health, and firmness in the right. He
has commanded the esteem of all in
the communities in which he has lived.
At the earnest request of the citizens
of Amador City, he was appointed a
deputy sheriff by the present sheriff
at the outset of the labor agitation
over the interpretation of the eight
hour law. He was selected as the
man tor the emergency, to maintain
order. By his firmness and determina
tion the crisis was tided over without
the least disturbance. He has never
been of the office, seeking class, but

GREGORY ON WARPATH
Without Any Provocation
the Sheriff Attempts to
Bulldose Reporter
"The supervisors of Amador county
are not a band of highbinders or
crooks" was the declaration made by
Lawrence Burke, chairman of the
board, at the meeting last Monday.
The assertion was made during a
heated argment in which district at
torey Vicini, sheriff Gregory, Lawrence
Burke, John Strohm, D. A. Eraser of
the board and John Ratto, the picture
show man, waged against the repre
sentatve of the Amador Ledger, who
objected to granting Ratto another
free license for operating a moving
picture show in Amador county on a
plea of poverty, when as a matter of
fact, it can be proven that the picture
show in Sutter Creek at present nets
more than fifty seven dollars per
week.
The best films may be secured for
315 a set, and each set runs for three
nights. In other words, Ratto clears
his film expenditure on his first night's
exhibit in Jackson, and then takes the
films to Sutter Creek, and Amador, or
lone, and exhibits them virtually with
out any further expense than the rent
of the building, and hiring what help
he might feel like employing. .
Supervisor Fraser informed ■ the
board that John Ratto was present,
and desired that something be done
about his future license, for operating
his picture machines in the county.
The license, . collectable by the
county tax collector, amounts to I $2.50
pei>:,exhibition. This, tax had been
remitted by the board of supervisors
on two previous occasions, and the
showman was given to understand by
the board, at' his appearance before
that body in November of 1909, that
he need not trouble himself any fur
ther about a license, as it was under
stood among themselves, meaning the
board members, that for certain reason
they would exempt him from all
license tax. This was a private un
derstanding which Fraser and Burke
confessed existed at the last meeting,
at which Ratto attended, and re
quested his free license. To be sure
this understanding had no business on
the minutes and was not entered.
Sheriff Gregory, was also informed
of the understanding which existed
between the board of supervisors and
Ratto, and did not ask a contribution
in the shape of a license for the sup
port of the government. The exemp
tion worked smoothly until the Ledger
discovered from the discarded and
smashed up ordinance that the show
man owed the county somewhere in
the neighborhood of $500 for licenses,
not covered by the exemption act,
which Gregory, as official tax col
lector, failed to collect.
Ratto arose and confusingly tried to
plead his case, explaining that owing
to the understanding which he and the
board had last November, hs felt free
from any back licenses which the
Ledger claimed he owed the county.
After a hearty scornful laugh over
the $500 debt due the county, the
chairman asked the district attorney
what action they were to take in the
matter.
Leaning back in his chair, the at
torney asked Ratto if he would be able
to give his show in Sutter Creek, and
clear enough money to pay expenses.
"No," said Ratto, "I could not, I
have expenses that are very heavy, as
any showman knows, who is in the
business.
"Well," continued the legal ad
viser, "Then you would be compelled
to close up your show in Sutter Creek,
if you did not run your Jackson show
in conjunction with it."
"Yes sir," answered. Ratto. Then
forgetting his poverty plea, Ratto
began railing Stinson. of the Amador
Record, for criticisms given his poor
exhibitions at Sutter Creek. "Why I
shoved $100 under his nose, and told
him I'd bet him any amount he never
saw better pictures.
The Ledger man here informed the
board if Ratto could go through the
county shoving a hundred dollars
under the nose of country editors, he
Continued on Pt»ge 5
Terrible Self-Indictment
In the discussion on the Ratto license
delinquency before the supervisors last
Monday, it was brought out as a rea
son why Ratto should be let oft" free,
that while the minutes of the supervi
sors showed that his free permit was
for six months, still it was privately
understood that the permit was for an
indefinite period— that, in fact, Ratto
was not to pay from that date anyway.
This secret understanding was admitted
by two of the supervisors, by Ratto
and the tax collector. It was pleaded
as justification for non-payment and
non-collection, and trotted out glee
fully as clinching the whole business.
And it was a clincher truly, but in a
far different sense from that intended.
Probably not one of the parties to the
contract realized the tremendous force
of the self-accusation. To our, mind
this admission is the worst feature of
the whole dirty, disgraceful business.
The only meaning we can attach to it
is that the supervisors were deliberate
ly hoodwinking their employers— the
people —whose business they were en
tiusted with. One thing was spread
upon the minutes, and a very different
thing was clandestinely entered into
with the parties concerned. The in
ference is that their own approved and
and signed minutes are not to be ac
cepted as a full and correct statement
of their proceedings. Amazing propo
sition. Citizens of Amador, think of
this, and grasp its full import if you
can, for we frankly admit that we can
not. For pity sake, how many more of
such private, secret understandings are
outstanding that we wot not of, to be
lined up against the official record.
But the record evidence must prevail.
Is it surprising that chairman Burke
should protest: "This board is not a
band of highbinders or crooks." There
are many other points in this wild ses
sion to be noticed, but we must with
old comment until 3ome other time.
How the People Feel.
The Ledger is receiving complimen
tary notices all around on the licence
muddle. One writer says :
" I guess they are all up against it
now that your paper has made the ques
tion public. There must be something
rotten in Denmark. lam proud of the
stand your paper has taken. When 1

especially when the editor is doing all
in his power to do the county good.
Keep up the fight, Mr Editor. Public
opinion is with you, heart and soul.
It is outrageous that one should be
made to pay license and another in the
same business go free."
We may say that the district attorney
was waited upon this week, and re
quested to take steps for the recovery
of the back license money, and the
stoppage of He said he
would look into the law, and see what
could be done. His decision is looked

ranging with the local republican com

in this county next week. An effort
was made to have the republican can

been arranged, and no changes in
dates could be made. The governor's
party will consist of seven or eight

each town on the route, the distin

at each place. At Jackson he will
stay for two hours, taking dinner
here, and also making an extended
address of half an hour or more.
Everybody should make an effort to
hear his speech here. He is one of the

and moreover he is in dead earnest in
the policies of state reforms which he
advocates.

WM. MATTLEY
FOUND DEAD
Team Ran Away Killing
Driver When Wagon
Turned Over
As Nelson Bastian and George L.
Thomas were driving a band of cattle
down the old road leading from Jack
son to Stony creek and Lancha Plana,
about a mile out of town they came
across an overturned wagon. with
two horses attached and underneath
the front left wheel was the dead body
ot a man. Bastian was riding ahead,
and noticing the overturned wagon in
the distance, he rode hurriedly
through the cattle to ascertain what
was the matter. The spot was op
posite the dwelling known as the old
Fritz place at the forks of the roads
leading toward Stoney creek on the
left and toward the lone road on the
right. Realizing what had happened,
Bastian rode back to Mr Thomas,
some distance in the. rear, and told
him of the affair. The two repaired
to the scene, and attempted to release
the body of the man from the wagon.
The weight was too much for their
united strength, the wagon being a
heavy one such as is used for hauling
wood, etc. So one of them hastened
to this city, to inform the authorities
and get assistance. The hub of the
wheel rested upon the temple. The
body was still warm, showing that
death had taken place but a short time
before. It was about fifteen minutes
past four when the discovery was
made. Although the victim was well
[known to both parties, they were un
able to identify him as he lay under
the wheel, and various rumors were in
circulation as to the identity of the
victim when the news was brought to
Jackson. It was known that Oscar
Myers, A. Fredricks, and G. Court
right, had been in town that- day
• and each of them were men-
I tioned as the probable victim.
The sheriff and district attorney
went out to the spot as soon as word
J reached them. Other 3 had also beep
attracted thither before their arrival.
'The body was released, and it was
: fonnd to be William Mattley, oldest
son of Dave Mattley, of this city.
He had been to the blacksmith shop at
Martell's to have his wagon fixed. He
was driving two horses, one of them
being a colt. He was returning home
ward, his residence being near Stony
creek. How the accident occurred no
one will know. It is evident from an
examination of the roadway and
tracks, that a runaway occurred. The
wagon struck a large stump that stood
in iront of the Fritz fence, and this
was no doubt the cause of the capsize.
The overturned wagon was some yards
ahead of this stump. The momentum
of the team Was perhaps checked
by the collision. The wagon turned
over to the left. How the driver, whose
seat was on the right side, carhe to
fall under the front wheel on the left
side is hard to explain. Maybe he
was pitched forward on the horses,
and then fell in front of the wheel, as
the wagon was going over. The team
is supposed to have come to a stand
still immediately upon the capsize.
The body was brought to Jackson as
soon as possible, and coroner Potter
notified. He came over from Ply
mouth the same evening, and sum
moned a jury, consisting of the fol
lowing: W. L. Fortner W. M. Penry
jr., W. J. Leavy, Thos. Lemin, M. H.
Fortner, C. M. Meek, Lee Wilson, C.
Giovanr.oni. The inquest was held
Tuesday moi'ning, and the jury, after
hearing the testimony, brought in a
verdict that the deceased came to his
death by his wagon being overturned
on top of him, caused by the team run
ning away.
Deceased was 49 years of age, a
native of California, and a member of
the N. S. G. W. Besides his parents,
and five brothers, he leaves two chil
dren, both living outside the county,
and both of whom were present at the
funeral. The funeral was conducted
Wednesday, under the auspices of the
local parlor of Native Sons, Rev.
Shea officiating, interment in the city
cemetery.

TAXPAYERS TAKE NOTICE
It becomes our duty to call the attention of the people of
Amador county to the disgraceful, illegal and absolutely;
revolutionary character of the proceedings before the board'
of supervisors this weeks. We deem it necessary to report
not only the official minutes, but also the heated discussion,
or rather wrangle, which enlivened the meeting, participated
in by members of the board, the district attorney and sheriff
and tax collector. We take no pleasure in parading such
disgusting talk in the columns of the Ledger, and we do so
for the sole purpose of enlightening the public concerning
the drift of events, and the high-handed and abusive tactics
resorted to by these swelled-up servants of the people when
any one has the courage to protest against their illegal ac
tion in trying to build up a system of discrimination and
favoritism in the collection of revenue. Nothing approaching
the scence enacted last Monday before the supervisors in
its utter abandonment of dignity and decorum becoming the
deliberations of a quasi-legislative body and the open defiance
of law involving the sacrifice of public interests, has ever
been witnessed in the history of Amador county.
A few months back the supervisors squared up an account
of about $1200 for the services of a so-called expert in going
over the books of county officials for a period of four years.
It was supposed to fall within his province to unearth dis
crepancies in the collection of revenue such as that herein
treated upon. His report shows that he was not looking for
big game of that kind. The Ledger man has for some time
indulged a suspicion that there was something amiss in the
license business, based in a measure upon braggadocio state
ments made on the street, and took the trouble to interview
the records on the subject. At the first rattle of the box he
was brought face to face with the fact that John Ratto, who
not only aspires to, but has actually enjoyed a monopoly of
the moving picture business in Ainador county for the past
two years, had contributed the priucely sura of $7.50 toward
the support of the county government during the entire
period. This would pay for three performances. The bal
ance of the time was covered by free permits granted by the
supervisors, but for about oue year he had couducted his out
side shows without either a free permit or the payment of a
license tax. The sum due the county treasury from him was
figured at over $500. Including the periods embraced by
the free permits, (which we do not hesitate to say were grant
ed authority of law) the sum lost to Amador county
from the moving picture source alone will aggregate iv the
neighborhood of $1000. I
The publication of the details in our article last week cre-|
ated a sensation in officialdom. The facts therein stated arej
not disputed — they are admitted to be substantially correct.
The board of supervisors met last Monday to fix the tax levy
for current year, and the opportunity was seized to wiggle
out of this license dilemma by the ex-postfacro route if pos
sible. That all concerned were excited beyond measure and
in no mood to act deliberately upon such propositions, is
evidenced by what was said and what was done. Suffice it to
say, the board, as far it was able, wiped out the back indebt
edness of Ratto, and gave him a free ticket for the future.
It is needless to say that in so doing the board transcended
its authority. Ratto is just as liable to-day for back dues and
future licenses as he was before the board met. Such issues
are not be decided by supervisors arrogating to themselves
powers that are confided to courts and juries. It is a mon
strous proposition that local ordinances can be made the in
struments of discrimination and persecution, in building one
man up in business and tearing another man down. Con
stitutional rights of sovereign citizens are not to be trampled
upon in that fashion. Those concerned are hugging a delu
sion if they imagine the people of Araador county will tamely
submit to such infamous abuse of authority. If their action
in this instance is to stand, the supervisors can use the club
furnished by the license ordinance to boost or crush men in
other lines of business, for any trumped-up reason or for no
reason at all.. Indeed, this phase of the question has already
developed. At the stormy session this week an application
was made (by the tax collector, mark you) for the remission
of a delinquent liquor license and a complimentary ticket to
cover the future. It is iv order now for every license payer
outside of Jackson to march up to the supervisors' bargain
counter and apply for a free pass through the tax-collector's
office. The matter haii been put up to the district attorney to
enforce the law against license shirkers, and thereby relieve
other taxpayers from shouldering their burdens.
SCIENTIFIC
MISCELLANY

Alloys That Crumble— How Radio
activity Is Measured— An Alloy for

Nickel Lithographic ' r Stones"—
Plants as Living Pumps— A Vacuum
Furnace— An Electric Eraser— Milk
Celluloid
The liability of certain iron-alumi
num alloys to fall to pieces spontan
eously was made known nearly twenty
years ago by Roberts-Austen, and
since then the same effect has been
noticed with cobalt, nickel, antimony,
molybdenum manganese and even with
zinc. It cannot be attributed to oxida
tion nor to silica. In a late paper to
the London Faraday Society, it was
stated that the disintergation follows
the alloy's marked expansion, which
on slowly cooling in a crucible may
continue for days and even months.
Chilling seems to arrest disintegra
tion, ns samples of the same alloy
that had been cast in iren molds were
perfectly sound years afterwards.
Many aluminum alloys have shown the
property, and reasons have been found
for believing that aluminum exists in
two allotropic conditions. Very pure
I aluminum has shown want of con
hesion when near the met] ting point,
mmking it appear that one form must
be wery weak and quite useless. An
interesting problem remains for the
metallurgists and they are expected
to show how the alloys can be made
safe.
Radioactivity, which has appeared
in so many substances, is measured by
comparing the time taken by the em
anation in discharging a charged
electrometer with the time of dis
charge by a standard radioactive sub
stance. Black oxide of uraninum is
the standard material. This is so
spread on a disk of 60 square centi
meters that the radiation per square
centimeter corresponds to that of a
centigram of oxide, and on another
disk 60 centigrams of the substance
under test are spread. Then the time
of the normal discharge of the electro
meter is noted, then the time with
each disk in turn under the needle—
the results giving the radioactive
value by a formula.
The cobalt-chromium alloy of - Ed
wood Haynes, Indiana metallurgist, is
claimed to rival the finest steel in
hardness and durability, and its resis
tance to corrosion specially fits it for
cutlery, surgical instruments, and
various tools.
The new rubber substitute of Dr. F.
G. Weichmann, called "protal," is
prepared by adding an animal albumen,
with a suitable solvent to a vegetable
albumen base, which is supplied in a
specially adapted form by the seeds of
certain palms. Protal is perfectly
plastic at first, soon acquiring the
hardness of stone. When first pro
duced, it can be pressed into molds or
otherwise shaped while cold, and when
made into dry powder it can be
pressed or molded on heating. It can
be loaded with any of the materials
commonly usod with rubber. Dr.
Wechmann nan used it with more than
eighty different substances, including
asbestos, shellac, linseed oil, cork
flour, pigments, rubber and bakelite,
and has produced compounds having a
wide range of properties, and claimed
to be adapted to the many purposes
for which rubber is employed. An ad
vantage claimed for these compounds
over those of rubber is that they are
not liable to deterioration from oxida
tion. The great variety of objects for
which these products are recommended
include buttons, chessmen, door-knobs,
picture frames, phonograph records,
spools, telehone receivers, battery
jars, gun-stocks, trays, tiles, grinding
wheels, electric insulators, automoble
tires, door-mats, soles, weather-strips*
etc.
The fine-grained slaty limestone
used in lithographic printing is expen
sive and cumbrous, and attempts have
been made to use aluminum and other
materials in its place. The latest sub
stitute is a plate of nickel. A sheet
of brass or other metal is scoured so
as to take ink and is then coated with
graphite and made to serve as the base
of a deposit of nickel by the electroly
tic process. The nickel is stripped off
after being given a blacking of zinc.
The face of the plate is in a suitable
condition for printing, and is claimed
to make an effective lithographic
stone.
The old problem of the rise of sap
in trees has been eolved by E. Rein
ders, a Dutch botanist, who has shown
in a novel manner that the living
wood acts as a pump. Presaure-metera
placed at different heights in the liv
ing trunk indicated independent and
irregular variations, but when the
trunk was killed the pressure differ
ences became simply such as would be
expected In a glass tube.
i The electric vacuum furnace of O.
Ruff, a Germun, consists of a tube of
retort carbon with }Jwalls about a
twentieth of an inch thick and opposite

view' holes near the center. The ends
have close-fitting jackets of retort
carbon, coppered on their outer ends,
whero they are connected to water
cooled iron blocks receiving the cur
rent. A non-conducting jacket en
closes the whole, and is contained in a
water-cooled brass case having two
quartz-glass view-holes for visual and
pyrometric observations, and with air
pump connections to exhaust the air.
With varying currents temperatures
were produced ranging from $1000
deg. to 2700 deg. C, greater heat
being impracticable on account of the
rapid volatilization of the carbon.
Among the uses to which the furnace
has been put is that of measuring
melting points. Through the quartz
windows the sinking of the metals as
it begins to fuse and be seen, and it
has been shown that platinum melts at
about 1755 deg. ; commercial iridium,
2225 deg. ; molybdenum, 2110 deg. ;
pure tungsten, 2575 deg. ; and kaolin,
1915 deg. In an atmopshere of nitro
gen, alumina melted at 2065 deg. , and
lime at 2035 deg., magnesia remaining
unmelted at 2400 deg.
To ensure neat correction of ink
lines on tracing cloth, an electrically
driven eraser has been devised for
draughtsmen. The flexible shaft of a
small motor carries at its outer end a
circular eraser, and as this is rotated
it operates lightly and rapidly,
effectively removing all undersired
lines. Clogging with particles of ink
and paper is avoided by the use of a
cleaning rubber, which bears lightly
against the erasing rubber.
The milk collars now much used by
tradesmen and artisans in Paris are
made from a celluloid from goats milk,
and are preferred to ordinary cellu
loid on account of their duller finish.
The material is prepared by separa
ting the whey of the milk from the
curds, then subjecting to great pres
sure. This celluloid is already quite
extensively made, being employed for
collar buttons, billiard balls, knife
handles, combs, and other purposes.

The El Dorado Republican says:
While the board of trade is sending
literature and advertisements broad
cast over the country, we believe that
it is making a mistake in not concen
trating its efforts upon the population
of the southern part of our own state.
San Diego, Imperial, Riverside, Los
Angeles and Grange counties contain
thousands of industrious people today
who are not entirely satisfied. These
people as a rule own property which
they can sell or dispose of to good ad
vantage, or have ready means avail
able for investment. Some of them
have tired of the dry and excessively
warm climate of that section, and are
thinking seriously of making a change
of location. They are as a rule suc
cessful small farmers and fruit
growers, with the frugal and thrifty
habits of the New Englanders, and are
good citizens. We believe that if the
board of trade would concentrate its
efforts in calling the attention of
peoplo in Southern California to the
opportunities offered in El Dorado
county from now until the first of the
year, many families would be induced
to come here to settle. Here is a
letter to the secretary of the locul
board of trade from v Riverside
county man, which goe3 to show that
our opinion in this matter at least hus
some tangible foundation :
Riverside, Sept. 4—l have just re
ceived a pamphlet regarding El Dora
do county, and am very much impressed
with what I read of your county, and
wish further information concerning
it. What 1 wish to know is the cost of
unimproved lands, and if any can be
secured along running streams. I'ive
spent twenty-five years in Sout m
California, and desire to get out of
this hot desert country tv a better 0 I.'.
Any information you will forward to
me will bo greatly appreciated. -F. S

Indian Queen Dies.
Indian Mary, a well-known character
among the Indians of this section, and
looked upon as queen of the Diggers,
died at the Indian reservation on Satur
day evening last, after an illness of
ten days. She was put down as 73
years of age, although her exact age
is involved in uncertainty. She has been
a familiar figure in these parts since
the advent of the white man, and was
regarded by her people as an oracle on
all disputable questions. For some
years she has been a ward of the gov
ernment at the Indian reservation three
miles northeast of Jackson. To dis-,
tinguish her from others the surname
of Clark was added to "Mary." She
was buried on Monday in the Indian
burial place on the Caminetti ranch
with all native honors— incantations
and mournful cries— befitting her high
station. Diggers gathered from far
and near, over 30 attending the last
sad rites. ■

Amador Citizen's
New Invention.
We copy the following notice of an
invention of Arthur Mills, who passed
the most of his life in the vicinity of
Aukum, in El Dorado county, but who
was principally identified with this,
county. He moved to Sacramento and
there met with an accident which will
probably cripple him for life. ■ The
Ledger hopes that his invention will
bring him ample h'nancial reward.
One exhibit which was shown by the
automobile department, because them
was no other place for it to go, was a
Sacramento invention known as the
automatic wagon. This vehicle is.
the invention of Arthur Mills of this,
city, and is the first radical change
made in the farm wagon in forty
years. It has no kingbolt, no reach*
nor has it a "fifth wheel," yet.it
rides so easy that there is not aa
automobile that can compare with it
in excellence. It has received . a
special first prize and is looked upon
as something which will revolutionize
the use of the farm wagon. It is
self-equalizing and the heavy box
rides as easy as a Pullman car over
ruts and ridges in the road. Frank
Newbert is at the head of the com
pany manufacturing the new wagon,
and Sacramento will now hava an in
dustry which will bring it to the notico ,
of the world as has never before
been done.

it is used in connection with Chamber
lain's colic, cholera and diarrhoea
remedy it means that it never fails to
cure diarrhoea, dysentery or bowel
complaint. It is pleasant to take and
equally valuable for children and
adults. Sold by all dealers.
My goodness, McGary's store is just
loaded down with nice goods.
Itching piles provoke profanity, but
profanity won't cure them. Doan's
ointment cures itching, bleeding or
protruding piles after years of suffer
ing. At any drug store.
Amiel Sabatini and wife, who reside
on Broadway, were visited by doctors
Stork and Gall on Monday last, the
former brought a large boy to the
Sauatini home, and tho latter in
spected the native son, and pronounced
him fine.
Albert Hambric and wife had a
surpiso given them on Tuesday last.
A boy was ordered, and when Dr.
Stork arrived, he carried a girl in
stead. Dr. Gall was consulted in the
matter, and urged the household to
keep the girl, as Ursula parlor was in
need of more members.

Chamberlain's colic, cholera and
diarrhoea remedy is today the best
kown medicine in use for the relief
and cure of bowel complaints. It
cures griping, diarrhoea, dysentery,
and should be taken at the first un
natural looseness of the bowels. It is
equally valuable for children and
adults. It always cures. Sold by all
dealers.
Lost Bet
Lawrence Mollino, who has been en
tertaining large ideas as to his ability
as a marathon hero, posted $30 with
several friends that he could travel
afoot from the gate of the ranch at
his home, to the National hotel in
Jackson,6 miles distance,in 45 minutes.
The rumer attempted to make good
his bet on Wednesday evening, when
he started the race. He was accom
panied by Williard Blakely, who
traveled on horseback as official time
keeper. The 45 minute time limit ex
pired as he reached the county hospi
tal, and the race was declared lost. .

REPUBLICAN TICKET
' Dniiiiiir'd from i
the republicans of the county, in look
ing over the field, concluded that he
wan the man above all others to make
the race for the position, and after
earnest solicitation ne decided to ac
cept the responsibility. It is a strik
ing instance of the place seeking the
man, and therein offers a marked con
trast to the case ot the man after the
office, ho signally illustrated in the op
posing ticket. He is not a man of the
braggladocio kind, a man of perfor
mance rather than empty promises.
He carries the impression of a strong
and well balanced character behind a
quiet and unostentatious demeanor.
Every voter should make it a point to
get acquainted with him during this
campaign.
Not a single reason can be given why
any republican should withold his
active and earnest support from John
S. Davis.
F. B. Lemoln
Is the party nominee for treasurer.
He is well known to the people of
this county of which he is a native. He
is 48 years old, and also a blacksmith
by trade, being at present employed at
the Preston school of industry in lone.
He was a supeivisor representing dis
trict five for several years, and his
close attention to the duties of that
office is admitted by all. Thereafter
he was appointed superintendent of
the Amador county hospital, and
filled that office for six years. The
administration of that institution
under his supervision, we are safe in
saying, was the best - the county has
ever known, both from the standpoint
of the inmates and the financial in
terests of the county. He now ap
peals to the voters as a candidate for
treasurer. He is honest, trustworthy,
and capable, and would conduct that
office with the same fidelilty and at
tention that has marked his official
actions in the past.
We are compelled to hold over the
rest of this article until next week.

HIDDEN DANGERS
Nature Gives Timely Warnings that
No Jackson Citizen Can Afford
to Ignore.
DANGER SIGNAL NO. 1 comes
from the kidney seretions. They will
warn you when the kidneys are sick.
Well kidneys excrete a clear amber
fluid. Sick kidneys send out a thin,
pale and foamy, or a thick, red, i 11
smelling urine, full of sediment and
irregular of passage.
DANGER SIGNAL NO. 2 comes
from the back. Back pains, dull and
heavy, or sharp and acute, tell you of
sick kidneys and warn you of the ap
proach of dropsy, diabetes and Bright's
disease. Doan's kidney pills cure sick
kidneys and cure them permanently.
Here is proof in the statement of a
nearby resident.
J. E..Wood, sewing machine dealer
1223 E. Weber Aye., Stockton, Cal.,
says: "Doan's kidney pills helped me
greatly and I am glad to make public
acknowledgment of the fact. I was
bothered by a lame back and I had
pains in my kidneys. I also had
trouble from a distressing kidney
weakness. Doan's kidney pills re
lieved my pains and aches and cor
rected the fault with my kindeys. My
experience with this remedy has given
me convincing proof that it acts
Dromptly and brings permanent re
lief."

Marks, and Brands
A/lust be Destroyed
For many years the United States
internal revenue laws have lequired
that immediately upon emptying of
any stamped package, of distilled
liquor the marks, stamps and brands
must be at once destroyed, and severe
penalties are provided, for failure to
comply with the law.,, Many liquor
dealers have considered it sufficient to
destroy the stamp and have neglected
to destroy the marks and brands. At
tention has been called to the law by
the authorities in Washington and in
structions have been given to rigidly
enforce tho regulations.
When a package is emptied every
mark, brand and stamp should be re
moved at once.

There is an immense difference between a tonic and a
stimulant. Up one day, way back the next; that's a
stimulant. Steady progress day by day toward perfect

SCOFF PRESS

could well afford to pay a license.
Sheriff Gregory was on his feet in
an instant, and turning to the
Ledger's reporter, he howled out,
"you d— little butt-in, its none of
your business what these supervisors
do."
When the sheriff was informed that
the taxpayers interests were being
protected, his wrath knew- no bounds,
and he shouted, "you don't pay taxes,
what in the h— do you care."
The reporter not wishing to be con
sidered in the wrong light of the
affair, declared that he did some day
expect to be a taxpayer in California,
and that he carried at the present time
tax receipts paid by him in Philadel
phia for the year 1909.
"It'll be a d- long time," he
roared, "before you pay taxes in this
county." ■
Then turning to the board, he con
fessed that he had been rather negli
gent in his duties, but said that he
had received no notification of the tax
being due, until through the columns
of the Ledger he was so informed.
'.'You knew of this affair several
weeks ago, why didn't you report it
then, ' ' said the enraged sheriff.
The reporter replied that it was the
tax collector's business to report such
cases himself, that when a newspaper
is compelled to expose such actions, it
has the privilege of selecting its own
time to do it.
Again facing the reporter he shouted
in his excited condition, "you, re ad—
little pissant,"
Gregory then asked the board if he
was to understand that he was not to
collect a license from any 10 cent pic
ture show.
The district attorney answering for
the board, said, "we will charge all
outsiders who come into the county
the regular rate."
The board then informed Gregory
to start immediately collecting from
Richards at Sutter Creek, whereupon
the sheriff pulled his hat down over
his ears, bit his lips and left the
room.
The press representative retained
his presence of mind to thank the
sheriff for his compliments, very much
regretting that the chairman of the
board was content to sit throughout
the entire affair without so much as
calling the sheriff to order.
Instead of calling for order, Burke
chipped in, and informed the reporter
that he would not waste time arguing
the matter with him, and that he did
not care a snap what Webb or the
Ledger said about him. He said he
knew that the people did not want
them to charge Ratto a license, and
therefore he for one wished to see him
go license free.
The district attorney, then advised
the board to make a motion, revoking
the back license and grant Ratto a
continuous free licence until further
orders of the board.
Supervisor Fraser then said, I make
a motion to revoke back license
against Ratto, and grant him a con
tinuous license until further order of
the board.
Supervisor Strohm said, "veil, I
second dot." Burke shouted, and so
ordered, forgetting for the time to ask
for the negative vote, and correcting
his own mistake immediately. The senti
ment of the boardwas so strong that no
reasonable argument could have had
effect at that time. Burke realizing
that he has no opponent, and the re
mainder of the board apparently un
concerned as to how the vote was car
ried.
Now, said the district attorney, that
ends that $500 proposition that the
Ledger shouted about.
"Yes," said Burke, "and if there is
any responsibility for this action I
assume all of it, this board can stand
the consequence. ' '
Ratto here thanked the board for its
action, and said he hoped they did not
consider him as trying to bribe them
for free licenses b., his treating them
to cigars.
It Sivsi His Leg.
"All thought I'd lose my leg,"

Sweetheart of Accused
Shows Her Devotion
In Courtroom.
Dan Cupid figures prominently in the
trial of Ira R. Allen, a youth of 20
years is charged with the murder of L.
P. Cosc'.a, a native of Italy, aged
about 70 years, who lived alone in the
hills, near Mount Aukum, fcl Dorado
county. Coscia was known to have
lots of money. Allen had a sweet
heart, but no money.
On the day that Coscia was supposed
to have been murdered, Allen does not
account for his whereabouts, but on
the succeeding days he had plenty of
money, and hired a rig from stables
in Placerville, drove to Shenandoah
valley, got Miss Gussie Thompson, hia
sweetheart, and for several days
there were picnics and dances galore.
Allen treated his friends and footed
the bills.
Later a watch which had belonged
to Coscia was traced to Allen and also
some opera glasses, and Allen told
the officers conflicting stories as to
how he came to have them.
The first week of. the trial is over.
Daily Miss Thompson, who is barely
13, small and handsome, follows
closely the proceedings of the court,
and when ncr eyes meet those of the
prisoner, who usually sits half facing
her, smiles are exchanged. When
there is a word that is derogatory to
her love she frowns. At recess she
comes and sits by Allen's side. None
of this love making is lost on the jury
and it is prophesied that they will never
-hang Allen and break the little girl's
heart. ' '* '
The evidence in the case is circum
stantial. Coscia's body was not found
for "many days, after he . had been
murdered. With some blunt instru
ment he was hit on the back of the
head. - Afterwards his pockets were
rifled and his cabin was robbed. Most
of his money was in banks in San
Francisco, and the murderers got only
about ?20. . .
George M. Thompson, the district
attorney, is prosecuting the case and
C. E. Peters is for the defense. There
are about 100 witnesses in the case
and 80 of these are for the defendant.
About the time Coscia was murdered
there were a number of sheepmen in
the neighborhood of Aukum The de
fendant will try to prove that these
are the men who made away with the
old Italian. Since the murder these
men have disappeared.
Miss Thompson will take the stand
in defense of her lover this week. As
the courthouse was burned last May,
the parlors of the Presbyterian church
are being used for the trial.
Mrs Joseph Wrigglesworth testified
regarding the visit that the murdered
man made at her place on the day he
was killed. He bought some cheese,
tendering a $23 gold piece in payment,
and she returned $19.57. There was
no money on the body of Coscia when
it was found. She also testified re
garding the watch of the dead man, of
his habits and general manner of life.
She, who as postmistress notified
Seeley, who was on the stand so long
yesterday, that Coscia had had no mail
delivered from May 11 to May 27.
This led Seeley to discover the body
of Coscia lying in a pool of blood the
next day near his cabin.
H. N. Vennewitz, a neighbor, testi
fied also. He wa3 on the coroner's
jury and told what was seen and done
at the time. George Cruson was also
on the coroner's jury, and following
along the same line, corroborating the
testimony of Vennewitz. He told of
the terrible wounds of the murdcreu
man, of the broken jaw ar.d false
teeth and of the crushed skull.
D. G. Justice, who is a neighbor of
iiart, foster fathe- of Allen, told how
Allen borrowed $1.50 on April 26th of
him. that he might take in the dance
at Somerset. This wa» but a few days
bafore the murder was committed.
Allen traded what purports to have
Wen Coscia's watch to a son of Jus
tice, the trade being made in the wit
ness' presence. He described the
watch minutely. . John Justice, his
son, was on the stand. He is a lad
about 18 years of age. He told the
same story. The trade was the watch
for a .38 caliber revolver, and was
made on May 22d. On May 27th, the
day Coscia's body was found, the boys
traded back. Since then the watch
has disappeared.
E. F. Smith, a jeweler and watch
maker, who has repaired Coscia's
watch and had written the numbers of
the works and case in his book, was
called. He testified that the watch
was brought to him while young Jus
tice had it in his possession, and he
put a crystal in it. Though there was
a slight discrepancy In one of the
figures, a "5" being found in one
place instead of a "3," he practically
identified the watch. On the dead
man there was found a memorandum
book, and in it both the numbers of
the works and case, and these numbers

Deafness Can not oe Cured

There is only one way to cure deafness
and that is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous liuingr of the Kus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
llamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can oe
taken out and this lube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an intlamed condition of the
mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars

tarrh) that cannot be cured by Hull's
