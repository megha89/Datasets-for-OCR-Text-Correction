returned to the level 100 soon after
one large blast had been exploded.
Time must be allowed tor the deadly

POSITIVELY APPENDICITIS
Four San Francisco Doctors Stated Jose

Operated Upon-— Dr. T. W. Hiag Cures
the Case Safely, and Quickly Without
Operating.
I had been suffering with kidney
trouble- for a year and about three
months ago it became complicated
•vith stomach ailment to such au
extent that I bad to stop my work at
the Keystono mine, Amador City. 1
treated with two doctors but grew
worse, until they stated 1 had at last
a bad case of appendicitis. 1 then
went to Sau Francisco whore four
prominent physicians stated i I un
questionably had appendicitis and
must be operated on. Then I thought
of Dr. T W. Hiug, the note* 3 . Chinese
physician, and returned to Sacra
mento August 27th. Dr. Hing told
mo at once 1 not only had an attack
ot appendicitis, but tuy stomach and
kidueys were diseased. His treatment
gave me prompt relief, in less than
ten days I was cured of the append
icitis entirely without any operation.
My stomach and kidneys improved
from the first until now I am per
fectly well in oveiy way and will re
turn to Amador City the end of this
week. This may seem like a miraile,
bu 1 am right here in Sacramento
ready to vouch for its truth. Those
suttering from ill health in any form
ought to consult Dr. Hing. lie is a

THEY CLEANED HOUSE
A TJNTQTTE PARTY WHICH FTJB
NISHED MUCH AMUSEMENT.
ft Was a Prearranged Affair by an
Ingenious Hostess' and "Was
Decidedly Enjoyable
for All.
"We shall clean house on Tuesday
evening. We need your help. Please
come dressed for work."
This was the surprising Invitation
sent out to a number of her friends by
a young hostess for a May entertain
ment that proved to be such a jolly one
that it is -worth trying by others, says
the New York Evening Telegram.
Fully half the fun was made by the
costumes in which the guests appeared.
All of the women were in short skirts,
some washable and others of wool.
Nearly every sort of kitchen apron was
to be seen. A voluminous artists' frock
enveloped one girl. On her head she
wore a serviceable sweeping cap of red
and white plaid gingham, and she car
ried in her hand a feather duster, which
she had brought with her. A bunch of
house Cleaning "rags" were tucked in
the belt of another worker. Among the
men "jumper" suits predominated, al
though there were a number of com
fortable bicycle costumes and one gaudy
sweater. Several men thought it ap
propriate to wear linen dusters, the
sleeves rolled above the elbow, and
these looked like enterprising grocery
clerks. '\ .
If ever any house seemed to need at
tention it was that one on that par
ticular evening. Apparently the litter
of a year's sewing lay on the floor and
cobwebs hung from pictures, chande
liers and every possible projection. To
make the place neat would not have
been the task of a moment at best. As
it was, when this was attempted, every
innocent snipping of cloth was found
to have been strung on a fine thread
and to be but one of a long chain of
them. Every raveling turned out to be
the end of a spool of thread and every
cobweb, all of which were of string,
proved itself to be but the end of yards
and yards unwound from a ball. Pieces
of tape there were, which led to the
original rolls, but neither these nor any
other, end drew directly to its source,
but each was tangled or even knotted
with the rest of the litter.
The work of cleaning up consisted' of
carefully disentangling every end and
winding it up and of gathering up the
chains of snipping and putting them in
a waste paper basket. A little colored
paper marker was found at the source
of every end, and as these were reached
they were collected and put into little
bags, which the hostess had supplied to
every one. The guest who found the
most markers was rewarded for such'
industry by the gift of a "Busy Bee."
't was a toy insect, which buzzed when
wound up. A more elaborate present
might be given if desired.
A "picked up" supper, consisting of
"cold foods, except coffee, was served
to the cleaners at the tilose of their
labors. It was a real supper of pressed
chicken, thin slices of boiled ham and
a potato, nuts and cress salad. The des
sert was fruit jelly and whipped cream.
For table decorations was a May
basket centerpiece with tiny broom
souvenirs for the women and little
wooden pails for the men.
During the evening some of the
guests, like witches, found time to
"brush the cobwebs from the moon."
Through a big half moon of bright yel
low paper long ends of yarn had been
threaded with a needle. The moon was
hung from the chandelier in one of
the rooms and those who "brushed" it
entered into a contest to pull out the
most cobwebs in three minutes, using
the left hand only and drawing out one
at a time. The prize was a small pot
of "green cheese," which the moon is
made of, as every one knows.
The two prizes presented during the
evening were given at the table and
the pleasure of opening and displaying
them was increased by the award of a
diploma wit hthe bee. It was a mock
certificate, enrolling the winner a
worthy member of the Janitors' associa
tion. His cleaning powers and personal
qualities were described at length most
comically, these particulars • having
been added at the last moment by the
hostess.
Higher the Waves the Fewer.
As the liner cleared the heads and the
ieavy swell of the open Atlantic be
:ame noticeable, dinner was served.
The 26 places at the captain's table were
filled, and as the soup appeared the cap
lain addressed his table companions.
"I trust that all 25 of you will have a
pleasant trip," he said, "and that this
little assemblage of 24 will reach port
nuch benefited by the voyage. I look
ipon those 22 smiling faces as a father
jpon his family, for I am responsible for
:he lives of this group of 19. I hope all
14 of you will join me later in drinking
io a merry trip. I believe we seven fel
ow passengers are admirably suited to
jach other, and I applaud the judgment
a'hich^ chose from the passenger list
these three persons for my table. You
md I, my dear sir. are — "
The captain chuckled.
"Here, steward, bring on my fish and
clear away these dishes." — Chicago
Journal.
Coat, Vest, Pants.
"He hasn't a coat to his back."
"Why not?"
"Because vested interests control
everything."
"No wonder that the poor man pants
for a more equal distribution of wealth."
— Louisville Courier-Journal.
The Chance Needed.
If some people could just get a
chance it wouldn't take them long to
show the world what they couldn't do.

Municipal
Corporations.
A Timely Treatise on the Subject
-The Danger of Undue Expansion
General Remarks. '
There are 136 incorporated ctiies
in Calfornina. These cities hare a
population varying from 340,000 to
less than 500. There are now about
forty with a population of less than
1000. They are divided into six
classes, according to population. All
towns with a population of less tnan
3000 belong to the sixth class. There
are Ht cities of this class in the state.
At the present time the only method
for a community to become an iucor_
porated town is to follow the method
prescribed by the state of 1883,
known -as the " Municipal incorpor
ation Act.
Mathod of Incorporating.
A petition must be presented to the
board of supervisors by the electors
of a given territory to the number of
at least fifty, showing (1) that the
territory sought to be incorporated is
not already incorporated. ('2) That
the territory described contains over
500 inhabitants, and (3) a description
of the boundaries of the proposed in
corporation, and then conclude with
a prayer that the same be incrporated.
This petition, together with a notice
as to when this petition will be pre
?euted to the county supervisors,
must be published two weeks (three
insertions) in a weekly newspaper
prior to the time of its presentation
to the board of supervisors. Then the
board of supervisors finally fix the
boundaries, determine the number of
inhabitants and call an election fh
the proposed municipality to deter
mine the question of incorporation.
The requirements of the statutes
must bo followed with the strictest fi
delity. The proper publication of the
notice is a very essential thing, as it
serves to give the board of supervisors
jurisdiction of the subject-matter.
To much care cannot be exercised in
this matter, for it would be a serious
thing to discover after a town had
been exercising municipal functions
for several years that its primary in
uorporatiou was of questionable vali
dity. Several towns have found
themselves in this predicament.
In preparing the petition the deter
mination ot the territory to be em
braced in the proposed town frequent
ly tequires the exercise of a nice
judgment and Eany things must' be
taken into consideration therewith.
The safe rule to follow is: Do not
include more territory than is ab
solutely essential, and yet the future
growth ot the town must to some ex
tent be foreseen.. We must consider:
Is the town growing rapidly? if so,
in what direction will it grow? We
•In not 'want populous suburbs just
outside of the corporate limits. They
ure frequently unsanitary and a
menace to the public health. So any
territory that is likely to be soon
populated should be included. All
territory not likely to be thus popu
lated should be excluded. Also ex
clude as much public highway as
■ ossibJe and lay out the city so that
few bridges ne^d be maintained. The
town should be so situated that one
general sewerage or drainage district
may be formed to include the entire
corporate limits. Include as little
agricultural - land and agriculturists
as possible. Those whose occupation
is agricultural have little need tor a
municipal organization, 'they do not
need sewers, or fire or police protect
ion, and it t.aey are forced to come in
they will prove a source of annoyance
and friction in the future administra
tion of the town. They will have to
pay taxes, receive no benefit and
will be continually objecting to all
public improvements, kick at all pro
gress and become a general hinder
ance. Some time in the future you
may wish to issue bonds for sewers,
electric light and water works, and
every man who lives out ot the reach
of these utilities will be sure to vote
against bonds, and as it requires a
two-thirds vote to accomplish these,
the fellows living on the outskirts of
town are frequently determining
factors in such worthy projects.
Benefits of Incorporation. •
The benefits resulting from a muni
cipal corporaton are those that flow
from the exercise of certain functions
that cannot be adequately exercised
in any other way. These functions
may be divided as follows:
1. Those relating to the public
convenience.
.2. Those relating to the public
safety.
3. Industrial functions.
4. Social functions.
Functions of Convenience.
These relate to the care, mainten
ance and use of public streets', which
include sidewalks, bridges and
squares. Streets must be construct
ed, repaired and sprinkled. They
should bo drained, and curbs, gutters
and culverts maintained. The con
vonifince ot the people requires also
that there should be sidewalks for
pedestrians and nowadays we are con
sidering that bicycle paths are al
most a necessity. Moreover, we also
feel a certain convenience and pleasure
in having the streets beautified by
the presence of trees, shrubs and
flowers. The City Beautiful is be
coming to be recognized as the com
ing city. It is the beautiful cities
that attract strangers and show the
most rapid growth.
While the county has power to es
tablish and maintain highways, it
really confines is duty to the main
tenance* of a mere passage way for
teams. A strip twenty or thirty feet
wide is all that is deemed necessary
lor that purpose, and if a locality
becomes' thickly populated, and re
quires a wider highway, a better
highway -and fitted to accommodate a
heavy traffic, finds sidewalks essential
and some ornamentation desirable, it
must look to some form of co-oper
ative effort od the part of the com
munity affected. 1 The county machin
ery becomes inadequate. For a time
the people will bear the expense of
the additional undertaking by private
subscriptions and until it is seen that
this expense falls on the tew who'
always contribute cheerfully and
liberally, while others equally bene-
Htted contribute nothing. This in
equality of sacrifice makes, manifest
the necessity for a municipal corpor
ation. So if a community desires
better streets, sidewalks, shade trees,
etc. at an equitable distribution of
cost, it must organize into a muni
thpal corporaton."^ \ . - •
Functions of Public Safety.
Under this head may be considered :
Fire protection, police protection
and health protection. jjS?
One ot the first needs of an urban
community is. protection against fire.
This the county cannot give. With
out it insurance rates will be exhor
bitant. In unincorporated towns
there is almost invariably an inade
quate fire protection and consequen
tal high insurance rates. The fire de
partments, such as it is, is maintain
ed at the expense of the few who
happen to be on hand when the
collection is taken up, and here again
comes the inequality of sacrifice for
the public good.
Furthermore, there is always an ab
sence of regulations to operate to
prevent fires. Fire trap buildings are
put up In dangerous localities, rub
bish accumulates in back alleys and
everything invites an early and dam
aging conflagration. The municipal
corporation alone has ' authority to
adopt preventative measures, and
those measures are more valuable
than a lire department.
The more populous a community
the greater necessity is there for
police protection. Acts which, in a
rural community affect none but ihe
doer, in a populous' communiy be
comes highly obnoxious to neigh
bors. Such acts must be legislated
against and punished, and here again
the municipality becomes a necessity.
The public health is of grave con
cern and it is the urban community
that is most susceptible to all forms
of disease. It is here that epidemics
ravage and take away our. loved ones.
it is in tne cities that disease
breeds and starts out to deal death to
the.- living, the strong and the beau
tiful.
Modern science is devoting itself to
the prevention of disease as much as
it is to its cure.
Cleanliness is the secret of health.
The law has been written "cities
must keep clean. " No' town, no matter
how small, can violate this law and
escape with immunity. It is recogn
ized that the various fevers are trace
able to filth, and that epidemiccs of
this disease can be avoided simply by
keeping clean.
Therefore we must have pure water,
uncontaminated by filth, pure air,
unpolluted by noxious gases, and to
have pure water and pure air we must
not permit filth to accumulate.
Therefore we must have sewers and
such health ordinances as will main
tain the health of the community.
The rubbish of the street, ana the
household 'waste, must be removed so
that it will not be a source of danger.
The municipal corporation alone
has the only ample authority to pro
tect the public health.
Industrial Functions.
Cities are rapidly taking upon them
selves new functions of an industrial
nature. 'They are operating water
works, light plants, street railways,
etc. A book could be written on this
subject alone and the advantages of
municipal operation portrayed. A
few words here must suffice. It is
generally conceded and statistics
show, that municipal water works
result in purer water, better supply,
better fire protection, cheaper rates,
•ower cost.
The same can be said of the muni
cipal lighting works. Over 10 cities
in this state operate water works and
a dozen operate water lighting works.
Social - Functions.
For the social betterment of a com
munity cities can maintain parks and
playgrounds, gymnasiums and baths,
libraries, museums and art galleries,
provide concerts and other forms of
entertainment and recreation. While
these things, are not essential, they
serve a high and noble purpose and
the communities who wish to reach
a high plane of social comfort must
have them and secure them through
the efforts of the municipality. The
public library is a very popular and
useful institution, and no city is too
small to maintain one. - There are
about fifty municipal libraries in
California and the number is con
stantly increasing. In one instance
the main incentive for the incorpor
ation of a town was the desire of its
people to have a public library.
What the Advantage Cost.
Having enumerated the various
benefits that a community may ob
tain, the next important thing to be
considered is the cost of the same. It
is a rule of human action that we
cannot satisfy our desires without a
sacrifice. We must pay the price for
all that we need for our physical and
social enjoyment. A municipality
can supply certain • conveniences,
necessities and comforts, and a com
munity can, by paying the price, take
little or all that it can supply. It is
like a store with its,'stock of merchan
dise, wherein a person may take one
article or the entire stock, if he is
willing to pay tor it. Some commu
nities require little,- others desire
much. Ho tax rates vary tram a nom
inal sum to an amount that some tax
payers may consider extravagance.
The instant a municipality corpora
tion is organized the territory is
withdrawn from the jurisdiction of
the county authorities. The care of
the highways passes from the county
to the municipality, and likewise the
revenue for the care of roads goes to
the municipal treasury. No road tax
is levied on the property in incorpor
ated towns. Also, under a recent de
cision, the city has the right to im
pose licenses within its limits. With
tbe revenue from these two sources
some cities carry on the local govern
ment. It jests largely, with tbe people
what tbe rate of taxes shall be. For
general purposes in sixth class cities
it cannot exceed Seventy-five cents on
the $100. This is certainly not an ex
travagant rate. In many of the small
er cities a rate of fifty cents is levied;
in a'few a smaller rate yet.
So in deciding upon tbe question ot
incorporation the matter is not one of
increasing the tax rate, bat it is of
determining whether or not all of the
advantages of municipal co-operation
will be on tap, whether we wish to
pay the price or not. In other words,
we are to lay in a stock of sewers, fire
apparatus, water works, lighting
plants, parks, libraries, health and
police regulations, to be delivered to
us whenever we pay the cost thereof.
We may not wish muny of these for
years, but they are handy to have at
hand.
The official salaries at flist should
be small. Five hundred dollars per
annum onght to cover till offioial sal
aries in a town of 3,000 inhabitants.
1 know of a town of nearly 4000, in
habitants where the clerk is paid but
8200 per year, the attorney 8100 per
year, the marshal and the tax collector
'2 per cent of moneys collected, and
the treasurer a small commission. .
In conclusion, 1 may state that the
city once incorporated rarely disin
corporates. Ido not know ot one in
the state where it is desired to aban
don the local government at tho pres
ent time, do this may be considered
as proving the .satisfactory character
of municipal corporations. New towns
are being incorporated at the rate of
three or four annually.— California

The amount of money reported as
needed for carrying on the school for
the ensuing year, necessitated a tax
rate of 47 cents on the 8100, and this
was 'the amount asked for. W. M.
Amick, the supervisor of the district,
was strongly opposed to such a heavy
rate, and wanted it • cut down to 40
cents. He was outvoted, however,
and the onerous tax was imposed. It
must be explained that a consider
able amount of money raised by this
high rate will be devoted toward pay
ing off, or reducing, the indebtedness
on the school building. V.:;
A Laxative Cough Syrup.
"A cold or cough nearly always
produces constipation — the water all
runs to the eyes, nose and throat
instead of passing out of the system
through the liver and kidneys. For
the want of moisture the bowels be
come • dry and hard." Kennedy's
Laxative Honey and Tar is the orig
inal Laxative Cough Syrup. It meets
and corrects the above conditions, by
acting as a pleasant cathartic on the
bowels— expels . all colds from the
system and cures all coughs, croup,
whooping cough, la grip'pe, bronchitis,
etc. Sold at the City Pharmacy.

FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 29, 1905
THE INCORPORATION ISSUE.
Ln another column we' publish an
article -on municipal corporations,
which the citizens ot Jackson will do
well to ponder. The article is froir
the columns of a journal devoted ex
clusivelj to tbe cause of incorporated
cities. It caunct, therefore, be said
that it is influenced in its advice by
self interest, or any motive other than
a general desire to aid in the incor
poration of California towns. Tht
disinterestedness of the advice given
is beyond question, and it is equall}
clear that tbe writer, having made v
special study of municipalities, is
thoroughly posted oh the topics ol
which he writes. As the Ledger has
pointed out, tne utmost care should
be exercised in the matter of fixing
the boundaries of the proposed city.
It plainly says that over expansion in
this respect is a fatal mistake, lo con
flue theboundaries to the town proper,
is the path ot wisdom, to take in a
lot of farming land,' or mining land
for that matter, is folly.
The Ledger sincerely 'desires the in
corporation of Jackson. The time is
ripe to assume the responsibilities of
self government. But in the discharge
of our duty as a journalist we cannot
advocate the incorporation of the
town along the lines set forth in the
petition. The people will do well to
take time to consider this matter in
all its bearings betorn committing
thesmelves irrevocably. To start right
is all important, if we start on a
wrong foundation, we shall be wrong
all through. The blunder will cleave
to us all through our municipal ca
reer. Better have an error rectified
now, even though it'does cause a little
delay, than push blindly on regardless
of consequences. We believe the citi
zens of Jackson are sufficiently broad
minded to seek incorporation for theii
own special benefit, and to. bear the
burden of government on their own
shoulders. They do not want— or at
least they ought not to want— those
wbo cannot hope to receive any bene
fit from incorporation to share in the
financial burden. . On tbe other hand,
the territory includes within the
proposed boundaries, rrom six to
eight miles :of roads, outside of
streets naturally falling within tbe
town limits. Now just fancy a city
government organized for tbe purpose
of improving the town, being saddled
with an incubus of such a mileage
of roadway to look after. The re
venue derived from the mines and
farming property included by these in
flationist would be a mere bagatelle in
the cost of maintaining such thor
oughfares. Take the Zeile mine for
instance. Suppose it is assessed for
$30,000. The taxes from this source
for the support of the city govern
ment, at the maximum limit of 75
cents on the 8100. woutd amount to
8225, the limit of which for road
purposes would be 50 cents on the
8100, or Sl5O. What would that
amount to— multiplied even -by
five or six times — in the care and
maintenance. of such highways. Who
then would have to pay for the bulk
of this work? Why the property
holders in the district where the
wealth is concentrated, ln other
words, tbe owners and tradesmen of
the business part of the city would
be called upon to pungle up for tbe
work. The inflation proposition
-works a hardship on both side 3. It is
utterly contrary to the legal axiom :
that lie who receives the benefit
should bear the burden ot expense.
That is a just rule. But in this case,
the farmers and mine owners would
nave to contribute for lighting, and
Bprinkling, road work, sewerage, etc.
of the town proper, and could not
hope for any improvements along
these lines for their property. On
the other hand, the town residents
would be compelled to put-up the
bulk of the money to repair the out
side roads and bridges, which would
far more than offset the taxes derived
from tbe oufcskirt territory. The
' miner and farmer would be hampered
and annoyed by ordinances and re
gulations applicable to essentially
city property, and never intended
under the law to include any othfer
kind of property. "Neither side
would be satisfied, and there would
inevitably bB perpetual jarring and
contention -between the two— the in
landers and the outlanders.
We trust that steps will be taken,
bafore the issue is pressed to a vote,
to have the proposed city reduced
to practical and sensible limits, and
thereby hold out the promise of
being a benefit and not a curse to the
residents ot Jackson.

The residents of the Union school
district at Angels are worked up over
the decision of the district attorney
of Calaveras county to the effect that
!hey will be required to pay a double
tax tor high school purposes — one for
the county high school and the other
for the support of their local high
school.
When tbe county high school was
located at San Andreas the citizens
of Angels and vicinity were cbagrin
«d, and voted a union district high
located at Altaville, under
he impression that they would be
exempt from the county, high school
tax. But in this they have been
disappointed. The maintenance of
tbe county high school involves all
tbe taxable pj operty ot the county,
no matter how many district high
-uljool may be established.
l'be anti-trading stamp law passed
by the last' legislature has been de
ulared unconstitutional by the courts.
The law was a stupid attempt to in
terfere with business, and was evi
dently prompted by small tradesmen
who were jealous of the success of
their more enterprising rivals.
Trades-people can now resume the
coupon business at their pleasure.
Communication.
- The rate of taxation for the Union
High School district is 47 cents on
the hundred dollars on aH property
in said hign school district* As tbe
business of the high school is now
conducted, it makes the residents
of the union high school district
unwilling philanthropists because the
trustees who are supposed to under
stand the law governing such high
schools have been mis-informed con
oerning their authority or right to
charge tuition for all pupils who at
tend the high school from districts
not included within tbe boundaries
of tne union high school district
As a result pupils are attending
from Jackson, Sutter Creek, Amador
and elsewhere tree of charge, in
creasing the expense of maintaining
tbe school and contributing nothing
toward meeting that expense.
Any one who has read the constitu
tion of the United States, which is the
fundamental law of the land, must
know that a law would be unconstitu
tional if it did not provide for a just
distribution of tbe burden ot taxa
tion for the maintainenoe of an insti
tution whose benefits all alike are
permitted to share.
Now the fact of the matter is, that
the trustees can and should charge all
nuu-resident pupils tuition.
Some may ask how much would
such tuition fee amount to?
It would amount to about three
fourths of the cost per' pupil per
mouth that it costs to maintain the
high school," j
It is to be hoped that the trustees
will meet and fix the rate of tuition.
Surely no self-respecting young per
son would wish to remain an unwel
come expense to the taxpayers of the
union higrf school district. Prom
such facts, as are now in my posses
sion it would seem that the tuition
fee would be about three dollars a
month. Mrs. R. E. Horton.
The Badaracca Case.
The preliminary hearing in the case
of Antone Badaraoca, charged with
the murder of John PendoJa near
KirKwoods, in Alpine county, was
held in Markleville on Saturday,
September 10. The defendant's coun
sel was an attorney named Brock
less, from Uardnerville, Nev. Only
three witnesses were examined for
the prosecution, one of them being
the boy Roy Kuffner, the eye" witness
to the shooting. Sherriff Glover
testified to an attempt on the part of
the defendant to bribe officers. On
the way Irom Kirkwood's to Markle
ville, alter the coroner's inquest, in
company with the sherritt and dis
trict attorney, the defendant is re
ported to have told the district attor
ney that the matter could be fixed,
and intimated that 51000 would be
paid in that behalf, raising the
amount to 82000, on being drawn out.
He was held to answer, without
bonds.
Ihe total number of persons eligi
ble for jury duty in Alpine county,
is 55. v Tweny five names are drawn
on the grand jury. It is intended to
call the grand jury next month, and
when that body is discharged, these
men will be eligible as trial jiiror.s,
giving the fnl] number of 55 out of
which to get a jury in the Badaracca
case. It is believed that a jury can
be secured without difficulty out of
tbe list.
The defendant it is said, when a
copy of the complaint was presented
to him in court, refused to take it.
It is understood thpt tbe case will
be pressed to trial as speedily
as possible, probably in the early
part of Movember. The intention
is to take the witnesses from this
county over the mountains by wag
ons, saving both expense and time jn
that way.

Suit for 810,000 damages tor injuries

on the 12th of May, he was working
in the shaft, 80 feet deep, and engag
ed in sinking to a greater depth.
Tbe rock was hoisted to the surface
by means of a bucket. The shaft is
a vertical one. Qa $be day stated a
bucket of material was in process of
being hoisted to the surface, and
when near the top the hook to which
tbe bqeket was attached straighten
ed out, precipitating tbe bucket and
its contents' to tbe bottom. It was
impossible for plaintiff to get out of
the way, and it fell upon him mangl
ing him and disabling him for life.
His right forearm was severed from
his body, his thigh was broken, and
his bead injured. He has not and
never will, so the physician tells him,
recover so as to be able to do manual
labor. He js informed that he will
have to undergo the amputation of
the remaining portion ot his forearm
in order to save bis life, The acoi
dent, the ooniplalut says, was wholly
due to the carelessness of defendants
in failing to provide proper machin
ery and a skilled engineer. That the
machinery and equipment, unknown
at the time to plaintiff, were ineffi
cient and dangerous. It is claimed
that the rope ran off the reel, result
ing in the bucket being precipitated
down the shaft. Plaintiff asks for
810,000 damages and costs of suit. ■ W.
J. McGee is attorney for plaintiff.

The Kind You Have Always Bought
Injured by a Blast.
Word was received Monday morning
that five men had Deen badly injured
by a belated blast in the Kennedy
mine. The report was fortunately
proved an exaggeration as far as the
number of persons injured was con
cerned, and the serious nature of the
injuries. It seems two men, both
Italians, were working in the 2400
drift of the mine. They had exploded
a number of holes, and started to
return to the face, when another blast
opxloded, pieces of rock striking
them on the face, cutting them con
siderably, but inflicting no dangerous
wounds. The men hurt are DeLama
and B. Navoni.

THE AMADOR LEDGER: JACKSON, OALIFOB-NIAt FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1905.

Incorporation Meeting.
Tbe adjourned meeting on the
matter of incorporation cf Jackson
was held in the court room Tuesday
evening, the supervisor's room being
too small to hold the crowd. Inter
est in tbe meeting was worked up
over tbe selection of clerk, and it was
freely circulated on the streets that
an etfort would be made to reopen
the nomination of Jas. J. Wright for.
that office, on some flimsy grounds.
The candidates voted for at tbe pre
vious meeting were J. J. Wright, A.
B. Caminetti, and Geo.' Kirkwood.
Wright received 14 votes, Caminetti,
12 and Kirkwood 5.~ It was announc
ed at the outset that tbe candidate
receiving the highest number of votes
would be considered tbe nominee.
The outcome was not satisfactory to
some and tbe fiiends of both parties
mustered iv force, in expectation
that some move would be made to
unseat Wright, and do tbe balloting
over again for that particular office.
After leading the minutes the com
mittee appointed to interview the
candidates and ascertain if they
would accept and qualify if elected,
reported that all who had been seen
signified their willingness to accept.
William Tarn said there appealed
to be some dissatisfaction over the
selection of one candidate on tbe
ticket, and be therefore moved that
tbe matter of nomination for the
office of clerk to be reopened.
The chairman said that tbe nomin
ation for clerk had been made as re
gular and as much in accordance with
the rule adopted as tbo other officers.
Only two of the five trustees received
a majority vote.
R. Webb said he was surprised at
the effort to undo what bad been done
at the previous meeting, and moved
as an amendment to lay the whole
matter on the table. The amend
ment was put and declared carried.
It was moved that a committee be
appointed to represent the incorpor
ation question before tbe supervis
ors at the next meeting.
R. Webb thought it was important
that the matter should be properly
laid before the supervisors, and es
pecially that the board be requested
to defer action until reasonable time
be given to thoroughly consider the
question ot boundaries. He said he
could not advocate or vote for incor
poration along tbe lines proposed.
He was very strongly in favor ot in
corporation, if the town limits were
reasonably confined to the town pro
per. But he believed by taking such
vast area of farming land, and em
bracing miles of county road, the in
corporation if carried, would prove
a curse rather than a blessing. The
correct rule was those who receive
the benefit should pay the cost. C.
P. Vicini was opposed to delay in the
election. He was in favor of taking
in all tbe territory as proposed, and
indulged in remarks of a personal
nature, intimating that the restric
tion of the limits was a move in favoi
of the mine owners. He wanted the
millionaire to contribute to the sup
poit of tbe town, as well as the small
property holder. The lines were all
right as they stood.
The chairman E. C. Rust appointed
the committee to attend to tbe matter
before the board as follows: Dr. E.
E. Endicott, C. P. Vicini and J. W.
Caldwell.
Violently Insane.
Thomas O'Brien was brougnt up
from lone last Friday to be examined
on a charge of insanity. He was vio
lently crazy, and four men had to ac
company him to the county seat, to
guard against violence. That' night
ho was taken to the hospital, but be
was so dangerous and violent, that'
they ware unable to nanage nim with
tbe force there, so he was lodged iv
jail. On Monday he was examined
by medical experts. He was taken
before thu court with hia hands
strapped together, as a precautionary
measure. Tbe present attack de
veloped Sept. 20, but he had been
previously committed for insanity.
He is a native of Ireland, 43 years of
age. The exciting onuses- of his men
tal unbalancing are alleged as indul
gence in liquor and exposure to the
sun. He was committed to Stockton
asylum, and taken to that institution
by deputy Kay Tuesday.

PROPERTY DEEDED TO STATE.
On Account of Delinquent Taxes.
We publish herewith a further list
of propeity in Amador county whioh
has this year been deeded to the state
of California on account of delinquent
taxes, together with the amount of
taxes due on each parcel at time of
sale. The sale to the state was made
five years ago, after the lapse of which
time the tax-collector, under the law,
is required to make out a deed to the
state, and have the same recorded.
This list completes the list of property
deeded to the state for the current
year, but it is by no means a total of
all property standing on the records as
belonging to the state on account of
delinquent taxes. All parties having
an interest in any property hereby
listed will do well to look into the
matter, and strighten out the title.
The original owners can redeem the
property by paying the taxes and all
costs and penalties, but the costs con
tinue to pile up the longer the re
demption is deferred. Besides this any
person is at liberty to have the prop
erty advertised and sold at public
auction, and after the property has
passed from the state, the right of re
demption ceases.

Life Imprisonment for Swearingen,
Samuel E. Swearingen, the self
confessed murderer, was brought be
fore the superior court last Saturday
to receive his sentence under his plea
of guilty as charged in the indict
ment, charging him with the murder
ot Mrs Phoebe A. Williams at Lancha
Plana on tbe 12th of June last. There
was a full court room on the occa
sion. D. B. Spagpoli, the appointed
attorney for defendant, was on hand,
and appealed to tbe court for clem
ency, on the ground that the-defen
dant had confessed bis part in the ter
rible crime, but took- no hand in the
actual killing.
Tbe court then ordered the defen
dant to stand up, and addressed him
before formally pronouncing sentence.
Tbe judge said, under tbe plea of
guilty tbe court bad the power to pro
nounce judgment of death. It was dis
cretionary with the court to fix the
penalty at either death or life impris
onment. He would take the merciful
view of it. He hoped the defendant in
the future would not falter in his
resolve to tell all he knew about the
crimes in which he took part. He
wanted him to tell the truth and only
the truth. He was then sentenced to
life imprisonment in the state prison
at Folsom.
Tbe prisoner received his sentence
without the least outward show of em
otion. He was pale, but not more so
than usual. He is a mere stripling,
with thin features, high cheek bones,
and long bony fingers. He looks any
thing bat the hardened criminal he is
reported to be.
It is said that Swearingen claims
that he knows nothing about tbe kill
ing of young Maker. That he was not
at the scene of that murder, and did
not know of that crime until after the
butchery of Mrs Williams. It is also
said that he .never before took part in
any crime. He denies all knowledge
of the Newswonger murder in San
Joaquin county.
Died in Sacramento.
Mrs. E. A. Cook, nes Augusta
Bennetts, died in tbe Sacramento
hospital on Friday last after a brief
Illnesss. Deceased was a daughter of
Richard Bennetts of Amador City,
and spent her girlhood days in that
town, where she was endeared to all
who knew her. A few months ago
she was married to Mr. Cook in Sac
ramento who was also a resident of
Amador City in bygone years, and a
nephew of the late Geo. W. Kling.
After marriage the pair resided at
Walnut Grove, where Mr. Cook is
engaged in the butcher business, but
he last enemy invaded the bappy
borne, and carried the newly made
bride to a premature grave. The re
mains were brought to Amador
county and the funeral took place
in Sutter Creek last Sunday, a large
number of sorrowing relatives and
friends following the remains to their
last resting place. Tbe bereaved re
latives tender their heartfelt thanks
to all who rendered aid in the final
sickness and funeral ceremonies of
their beloved one.
For Resisting an Officer.
The case of People vs B. E. Letang
charged with resisting an officer, was
tried before justice Goldner and a
jury of eleven, on Tuesday last. Tbe
district attorney appeared for the
prosecution, and C. •H. Crocker for
the : defendant. This is one of those
lamentable cases of criminal prosecu
tion which occasionally disfigure the
annals ot our county. This ought to
have been avoided by an understand
ing between the parties. Letang is
the owner ot tbe gas works. His pipe
crosses the creek opposite the gas
meter, laid on the bedrock and
anchored therto. It has lain in the
identical position it occupies to day
for twenty years. No one ever dream
ed in tbe years past that this three or
tour inch main was a nuisance by in
terfering with the natural tiow of
water. And as a matter of fact it
does not now, and never did, inter
fere with tbe waterway. Refuse and
sewage in the creek did not accumu
late and stagnate there. But parties
wanted a ditch cut in the creek in
the bedrock.
Letang testified in bis own behalf.
He admitted that he had filled up the
ditch behind the man wbo was digg
ing it, as he considered it was an in
jury to his property. He believed he
nad a right to protect his property.
He did not lay hands on anyone or re
sist arrest. It would cost $150 to lay
tbe pipe in the bedrock at a lower
point. The jury was out but a few
minutes, when a verdict was leturned
of guilty. The court passed sentence
this morning, imposing fine of 8100
The case decisively settles nothing
as to the real merits of the contro
versy. It does not settle tbe rights
of Letang in the premises, or deter
mine whether or not tbe officials have
any right to invade a man's private
property without notice .or per
, mission.
MINING NOTES.
Argonaut— This mine continues to
move along prosperously. The ore
body south of the shaft has opened
out largely, giving promise of a long
life of liberal production of the pre-"
oious metal. The company is pay
ing monthly dividends of 10 cents
per share, amounting to §20,000 per
month and the outlook favors tbe
continuance of this rate * for some
time. The work now in hand is
changing from water to electric
power. The mill, rock breaker and
compressor will be operated by {his
power.
Central Eureka— W. R. Thomas, the
efficient superintendent of this mine,
we are pleased to state, has not re
signed his position. He was taken
sick, necessitating a cessation from
his official duties for some time, and
talked of resigning in the prospect of
not being able to give his personal
attention to the property. But the
company, fully appreciating the
services he has rendered, refused to
listen to such a suggestion. He was
at liberty to take a vacation for two
months or three months, but as for
severing his connection with the
mine, they would not listen to it.
His health is improving rapidly, and
it is expected that he will resume his
duties as superintendent at tbe mine
about the first of October. hi.
Degolia.'one of the head officials of
the company, was in Amador county
last week, on business concerning
the mine. The company is now pay
ing dividends of five cents per month,
and the mine is looking well.
Zeila — A transformer building has
been erected by the Zeila mine be
tween the public road and the mill,
for use in the supply of electric
power to run the mill and air com
pressor. It is constructed of galvan
ized iron. The motors for running
the electric machinery are not all on
the ground yet.
Climax— The work of getting the
new 10-stamp mill in running order is
being pushed with allpossible speed.
It wll take some thirty days more
before the mill is ready to enter upon
its career of crushing rook. The
company is spending large sums of
money on this enterprise, including a
pipe line 4000 feet in length, and two
miles of ditch to bring water to the
mine,

TRIALS OF A GEOLOGIST
His Precious Specimens Surrepti
tiously Disposed Of by a Con
scienceless Carrier.
Prof. W. C. Hayes, of the geological
3urvey, was talking in. Washington
ibout the trials of geologists, states the
Buffalo Enquirer. •£:"•*.
"Did you ever hear of the geologist
In New Hampshire?" he asked. "Well,
there was a geologist who spent a loiif?
hot summer day in Croydon gathering
specimens of the very odd New Hamp
shire rock formation to be found there,
and late- in the afternoon he hired a
boy to carry the heavy bag back to
Newport for him. The boy exhibited
to a friend that night a half-dollar and
the friend said enviously:
" 'Where did you get that?'
" 'I made it,' was the answer.
" 'How did you make it?'
" 'You know that there man that
was working all day with a little
hammer hereabouts, chipping off pieces
of rock and putting them into a leather
bag?'
" 'Yes.'
" 'Well, he asked me to carry his
bag for him to the Newport hotel, and
he gave me 50 cents for the job.'
".'Well, it was worth it. Must havf
been . pretty heavy, carryin' all them
rocks four miles.'
' " 'Do you think I carried them rocks
all the way?' he said. 'No, sir. I
emptied the bag before starlin", and
just filled it outside the hotel.' "
THE SOUTHERN BARBECUE.
Preparation of the Feast as Described
by Ono Who Has Had
Experience.
The way we fix for a barbecue is to
begin to get ready the day befo'. The
meat is roastin' all night, says a
writer in Outing. We have plenty oi
different kinds — shote, calf, kid and
goat — and we roast 'em whole. A
trench is dug and oak bark coals put
in. Then sticks are lai I across for the
shote and other creatures to rest on.
Some white man has this in chargo,
but th? niggers keep the fires goin'
an' tlo the basting and Van rough
work. The next day everybody comes.
There's a detail to do the carving, and
we all step up and get what we want
and go and set down by some tree to
eat it. Of course, there's potatoes and
cornmeal. light-bread and pickles and
cake, and there's ice cream, and there's
pure, genuine coffee that the old ladies
make in abundance. Then there's fried
chicken if anyone is fastidious enough
to want it. and some enterprising fellow
is likely to bring a dozen bottles of
beer and invite his special friends out
to his buggy to drink it. But the
best thing to my thinkin' is the shote.
A man hasn't got any part in'the resur
rection until he's eaten barbecued shote.
Reversing Speech.
A very curious phonographic instru
ment, invented by Poulsen, and capable
of reversing the sounds of a word or
a sentence, was exhibited at the Phila
delphia meeting of the American asso
ciation. A steel piano wire, carried on
two spools, passes between the poles
of a small electromagnet so connected
with a telephone transmitter that
spoken words are magnetically record
ed on the moving wire and reproduced
in a receiving instrument. When the
motion of the wire is direct, the words
are heard as in ordinary conversation,
but if the motion is reversed, the
sounds come to the ear in reverse or
der, like words spelled backward. To
represent the order in which the re
versed sounds strike the ear, however,
not only must the order of the letters
composing a word be reversed, but
each letter must itself be reversed from
right to left, as when reflected from
a mirror. — Youth's Companion.

LIGHTS IN LITERATURE
The first volume of the unpublished
writings of the late Theodore MomfuSea
has been prcnared for publication by
Prof. Otto Hcrsenheld, the literary ex
ecutor of the deceased historian.
Rider Haggard is best known la
America as a writer of startling roman
ces, but in his own country he is recog
nized as an earnest student of the great
problem of the poor. For years the au
thor has been laboring for the develop
ment of the agricultural side of English
life as a means of relieving the congest
ed conditions of large cities. : 'j |
Anthony Hope, the British novelist
and playwright, was educated for the
law, but says himself in his droll way
that he failed to make a living at his
profession and had to turn to writing in
self-defense. He declares that in all his
life of 42 years there has not come one
incident that is worth telling — he ha 3
just lived "the average life of an Eng
lish gentleman."
It will probably seem strange to some
that John Hay in 1m later life was in
clined to be rather ashamed of "Little
Breeches" and "Jim Bludso," the two of
his poems that have always been the
most widely quoted. Similarly James
Russell Lowell was rather ashamed in
his declining years of the "Bigelow Pa
pers," which many regard as his most
original and effective work, and Minis
ter Phelps never liked to be quoted as
the author of that immortal poem about
Essex Junction. . . ;
William Dean Howells has some en
couraging words to say to young as
pirants for literary honors. 'There U
room for a good story of any kind," h9
said, recently. "Although an editor
governs his judgment by what his read
ers have liked before, often rejecting
something they would like much better,
no good thing in a story ever remain 3
unpublished. Some one will read it.'feel,
its truth and print it if it is true." But
he goes on with a word of advice. "I do
not believe anyone can write a novel,
with rare exceptions, until he has lived
at least 35 years in experience of tha
world."
ODDITIES OF INVENTION.
Prof. Baiardi, of Turin, has suc
ceeded in perfecting his invention of
photographing the eye and advo
cates its practical use for diagnosis of
diseases of that organ.
A French engineer named Otto has
invented an apparatus for purifying
drinking water at home; its capacity is
60 gallons an hour, and its cost about
the same as that of an electric incan
descent light Ozone is generated,
which kills all germs in the water.
In some parts . of the west where
irrigation is much depended upon, .a
"current motor" is in use .which, by
an ingenious use of lever 3 and iron
blades, makes the water of flowing
streams pump itself. The pressure ol
the current causes the blade to swing
backward and forward, and the force
thus exerted is communicated to ma
chinery which runs a pump.
The recent classification at the Brit
ish patent office shows that cooking is
the popular subject of invention, hav
ing been the subject of 3,575 Britist
patents in 48 years, or an average ol
73 a year. Umbrellas brought oui
1,457 inventions, and hats 1,411. .In
vention tends to run in grooves, 189(
and 1897 reflecting the enormous de
velopment in cycles, while motor ve
hicle inventions have doubled sine;

CONCERNING THE CLEBG*.
Rev. Joseph W. Cross, the oldes
living alumnus of Harvard college an<
the Andover theological seminary
celebrated recently his ninety-seventl
birthday.
At the late commencement of Ohi<
Wesleyan university the degree of D
D. was conferred on Rev. Byroi
Palmer, of the East Ohio conference

Rev. Dr. Barnard M. Kaplan, Tabb
of the Bush Street temple of San Fran
cisco, received from President Roose
velt an autograph copy of his Califor
nia speeches for the benefit of th«
Bush Street temple.
Glasgow university has conferred th«
degree of D. D. upon Rev. W. H. Bent
ley in recognition of his services or
the Congo. Mr. Bentley is the son ol
a missionary, and has given 27 years
pf service in Africa. He is the author
pf the Congo dictionary and grammar,
has translated the New Testament, and
is now engaged in translating the Old
Testament

In a recent article on Americans an
English writer gives the following as a
characteristic American after-dinner
story, its subject being a politician in
bathing: "All at once a shark, a man
eater, was coming the other way, and
swam up squarely in front of him.
They eyed each other for a moment
and then the shark — blushed and sped
away." Bf?£
Locker Sampson, .whose name is in-*
separably connected with the Rowfant
library, now awaiting some ruch cus
tomer on the shelves of a New York
book house, once complained to Bed
ford, the famous bookbinder, that one
of his recently bound treasures "cock
led;" that is to say, opened of its own
accord. Bedford, scrutinizing first the
book and then the owner, said with
great severity: "You've been reading
it"
An Englishman in Canada writes
Rome in considerable excitement as
follows: "The majority of Canadians
never read an English paper of any
kind whatever; all their literature is
American. All the booksellers' shops
are filled with American books, Amer
ican reviews, American papers. And
with what result? There can be only
one result — Canadians will think
'Americanly.'" ;- :_--J: _--J- Tt
Gen. Miles has a story of a corporal
in a regiment under his command in
the old Indian fighting days. This
corporal was much chaffed by his 'com
rades for his oft-repeated expressions
of belief in "fatality" and "destiny."
One day it appears that the corporal,
while off duty, was preparing to take
a little horseback exercise and recrea
tion. A private observed that the cor
poral took care to attach a brace of
pistols to his saddle. "Hello!" shout
ed the private to the corporal, "what
are you taking the guns for? They
won't save you if your time has come."
"True for you," grimly responded the
corporal, "but I may happen to meet
an Apache whose last day has come."
OLD-WOBLB ODDITIES.
A new and unwelcome visitor has
been recognized in England. He is
the Surinam cockroach, and is de
structive to greenhouse plants. The
insects are believed to have been in
troduced in a consignment of orchids.
The town of . Thurso, Scotland,
comes to the front with 4 family rec
ord which will not be beaten easily.
John Gibson, S7 years old, still follows
his duties as superintendent of some
flagstone quarries. Among the work
men he has seven sons, six sons-in
law, 29 grandsons, four grandsons-mr
law and two great-grandsons. Forty-:
nine members of one family, all con
nected with the same trade, employed
in the same works, and living in the
same district, is something decidedly
out of the common.
Baron Rothschild, : head of the
French branch of the family, recently
received a curious legacy. This was
the fortune of an ancient beggar
named Abraham Fidler, who died in a
garret at Nice, and was found to pos
sess 1,250,000 francs. He bequeathed
it to the other millionaire, on the plea
that "money must seek money."
Baron Rothschild was riot of the opin
ion, in this case at any rate, and he
proceeded to hunt up the lamented
Fidler's relations, three of whom
were found at Odessa and a fourth at
Brooklyn. The legatee divided the
million and a quarter among them.
An Edinburgh minister lately
rolled 1,000 feet down the steeps of
Ben Nevis, and lives to tell the tale.
Admiral Sir Novell Salmon was clean
shot through at Lucknow, and re
turned as dead, but came up smiling
soon afterward. Similar was Lord
Wolseley's experience in the Crimea,
but though pretty well riddled with
shot a::cl shell and deprived of the
sight of aii eye, he was able soon after
to enjoy a laugh over his own obitu
ary. Not long ago there was a girl
up on trial in a London police court
who had twice attempted to commit
suicide, but two trains had passed
over her and left her unscathed.
