THE INCONSISTENCY OF IT
I goes wihou saying ha he course bf he Ledger m ex
posing eeryhing ha saors of he naure of graf in con
necion wih he couny goernmen ha cornea wihin is
knowledge, has awakened in official circles an inense hos
iliy agains his journal, and is edior Eery flimsy sub
erfuge has been resored o in he effor o hamper he Led
ger in he allowance of claims before he board of superisors
Hereofore proess on his score, promped by selfeiden
animus, hae been ignored, and bills hae been eenually
allowed as presened We hae reason o beliee ha eery
iem included in a Ledger bill is scruinized and compared
—no wih he esablished schedule^ for usually ha obsolee
lis of ii years' sanding — does no ouch he subjec a all —
bu wih similar iems preferred by ha goodygoody, dumb
asanoyser adminisraie organ, he ispach The hollow
ness of he scheme is reealed when oher prining bills are
passed wihou een sopping o inquire wheher he arious
iems allied wih he longdisance raes hereofore referred
o, and nowihsanding his paper has repeaedly shown ha
he charges did no so correspond If he same zeal in ward
ing off oercharges had been manifesed in all direcions in
he prining bills, insead of being confined o he Ledger
office, we enure o say he resul would hae been, a maer
ial saing o he couny
I will be noiced from he proceedings of he board of su
perisors published in his issue ha a claim for $io pre
sened by he Ledger was allowed in he sum of $3 The
bill was for prining 50 copies of he lis of quesions adoped
by he board of educaion for he examinaion of applicans
for eachers' cerificaes held in ecember las This job con
sised of a shee embracing four columns of solid breier ype
each column nearly he lengh of he columnson he firs
page of he Ledger The maer conained herein, according
o priners' measuremen, measured oer 13,000 ems, and
included  algebraic signs specially purchased for ha class
of work, and also geomerical angle work The superisors
ook he bn heir mouhs, and slashed he bill arbirarily,
wihou giing he claiman an opporuniy o be heard The
only excuse we hae heard for heir acion is ha, hey dug
up from he archies of he reasurer's office a claim for sim
ilar work for he eachers' examinaion quesions in ugus
las This was done in he ispach office I conained
oer 20,000 em's of leaded nonpariel ype, and he bill for
100 copies was pu in for $350, and allowed a ha figure
Wha led our coemporary o be seized wih such a wondrous
spasm of generosiy in prining raes — so uerly ou of join
wih is esablished record — we can only surmise The work
was ordered by he school superinenden, and wheher
he low price was laid in anicipaion ha fuure orders for
such work would go o he Ledger, and hereby lay he foun
daion for he superisors' acion in considering a claim from
ha source, we are no prepared o say I srongly smacks
of a plo in ha direcion, in he ligh of recen reelaions
The mos chariable inerpreaion of he superisors' acion
in cuing he Ledger's bill is ha hey did no know wha
hey were doing, and made no effor o seek enlighenmen
from disineresed and unprejudiced sources We do no
propose o ener ino he meris of he maer now The
amoun inoled is no worh fighing for, bu he principle
inoled is ial, and he spiri [displayed canno be oleraed
in goernmenal affairs Of course, we refused o accep he
absurd amoun, In he enire lis of bills presened for prin
ing by he Ledger office in he pas seeil years, we enure
o say hey could no hae seleced a more indefensible one
for he cuing process han he one hey jumped upon wih
boh fee
In his connecion we may remark ha a bill of he is
pach was allowed a he same meeing for he full amoun
claimed of $26035 There were no scruples apparenly on his
score, and eidenly he iems hereon were no een com
pared wih he schedule of raes promulgaed in he long ago
The claim was presened by he organ of he ring, and hence
was o k Now, some of he iems are worhy of sudy One
we will call aenion o here Six housand fie hundred
regisraion affidais are charged and allowed a $6750
The regisraion affidais under he old regisraion law,
were scheduled for his couny a $5 for 500, ha number
being he ouside limi of requiremens in one year Bu
now s differen, when a new regisraion is required for
eery general elecion Bu he schedule has no been
changed, so he ispach sicks in a claim for 6500 a he
rae fixed for 500, and hereby made a rich haul We hae
no doub he work could hae been done for $20, and a big
margin of profi lef a ha Tha's he way he money
goes No wonder our coemporary could afford o gie a

Kobert I. Davis died at the home

Davis of Shenandoaii Valley, Sunday
evening, Jan. 'ititu. lie bad been
sick for nearly a year, and for about
three months it had been known that
bis recovery was, humanly speaking,
impossible, yet the end was utterly
unlooked for at the time and came
as a cruelly sudden shock to all who

J. >S. Davis of Amador City, who hud
spent the day at borne, wiis preparing
to return to his work, and, with the
others of the family, bad gathered in
the sick room for a chat, when -the
invalid suddenly collapsed, and whoa
the atteding physiciau, summoned by
the telephone, arrived, it was only to
tell the family that the brave heart
had ceased to beat. Tbo funeral was
held Wednesday afternoon under the
direction of Plymouth Parlor N. S.
(j. W, , interment being in the little
cemetery.
Kobert Davis was born July .11,
1831, in Huouandoah, where practical
ly his entire life was spent, and where
as a boy and man bis upright char
acter, bis ebony good humor, his
willingness to do bis full sUa.ro m a
neighbor or citizen won him the lik
ing and respect of all who knew him.
Until the beginning of big illness in
Maich of last year, be was unusually
active and energetic in private busi
ness and local affairs, and well known
as an athletic, liy some it is sup
posed ,that an injury received in a
baseball game was responsible for the
fatal illneas, but that is merely con
jecture. His relatives know of no
such injury that could havo been
serious. For months after his ill
ness began there was no symptoms of
lung complaint, and when at laat
the nature ot the disease became
apparent, it bad progressed too tar
to be stayed. Always cheerful and
hopeful of recovery, always patieut of
weakness aud pain his last mouths
showed him of heroic spirit, aud with
the passiug of that pure brave spirit
his friend* can say. "It is well with
him."

Because we make medicines

and they prescribe it for
coughs, colds, bronchitis, con*
sumption. They trust it. Then
you can afford to trust it.
