THE CITY'S FINNCIL STTEMENT
We las week published he financial saemen of he ciy
clerk, showing he receips and expenses of he municipal
goernmen for he year ending January 31, 1910 — he
fourh year of Jackson's life as a ciy of he sixh class The
showing is desering of noice in seeral respecs I does
no surprise hose who fairly and imparially anicipaed he
expenses of mainaining a separae goernmen and he
probable income for he suppor of he same On he ee of
Jackson's incorporaion ecember Is, 1905, he Ledger
published an aricle on he pros and cons of he incorporaion
proposiion The aricle gae an esimae of he reenue for
he suppor of he ciy esablishmen, and also a rough
esimae of he cos of keeping up he ciy household I
will be remembered ha a he ime he aricle was published
he saemens herein made were criicised by he rabid and
ineresed adocaes of puing on ciy airs I was con
ended ha he iems of our cos bill were wildly exaggeraed;
h salary lis and oher probable charges were oerdrawn
We laid away a copy of he Ledger conaining he aricle a
he ime i was published, confiden na our esimaes were
conseraiely drawn, and ha he march of eens incase
incorporaion carried, would indicae he sand we hen
ook in giing an imparial and disineresed opinion on he
issues inoled, We placed he Ledger in a pigeon hole,
where we could lay our hand on i a any ime i migh be
needed, o show i was no he Ledger ha was embarking in
an airship, bu raher hose who were so loudly proclaiming
ha he quesion was one of all profi and no loss In
anoher column we republish his aricle, so ha our
readers will be able o judge for hemseles wheher we
correcly gauged he siuaion a ha ime Underneah
ha aricle we reproduce he receips and expenses of he
ciy goernmen for he pas year, as shown by he clerk's
official saemen The figures speak for hemseles, and
need no commen on our par
Coming back o he showing for he pas year, we find
he oal expenses were $13,32928 This is abou $5 50 per
head, reckoning he populaion of he ciy a 2500 This is
for regular running expenses — he ordinary expenses ha
hae o be proided for eery year issecing hese figures
we find ha he iems of salaries, commissions and ren ea
up oer $3000 of his sum SprinklingPersonal and waer ook

which we presume represens work on srees, $506922 I
is no o be dispued' ha in he maer of lighing and

ogue before incorporaion; also more is done on he srees
han formerly Bu he quesiou is are we geing anyhing
like alue for he asly increased expenses as compared
wih former years We hae no sewer sysem now any more
han formerly The saniary condiions in his regard are
if anyhing more unsaisfacory han hey were before nd
his is said in no spiri of faulfinding, bu is based on he
assumpion ha he ciy funds hae been spen o he bes
Now le us urn o he sources of income The wrier

municipal goernmen mus necessarily enail increased

In he maer of he esae of Sarah

Tnis is a cones for leers of admin

Sarah  Serine died on Oc 10, 1909,
a residen of he couny of mador,
leaing suriing as her only heirs,
her wo daughersPersonal Mrs Carrie Tarr of
Idaho, and Mrs Nellie Werley of

She lef a las will bearing dae,
July 29, 1908,  wih a codicil hereo
daed Oc 9, 1909 By he erms of
said will and codicil she bequeahed
cerain propery o her grandchild, Ola
G Werley, who is he minor child of
said Nellie Werley
eceden's said daugher Carrie Tarr,
was named in he will as execurix, bu
she has declined o ac as such and has
irf wriing requesed ha leers' "of ad
minisraion wih he will annexed be
issued o he peiioner, H E Poer,
who is he public adminisraor of he
couny ''
John H Werley who is he guardian
of he minor, Ola G Werle, has  con
esed he peiion of Mr ' Poer, and
iled his own peiion praying for he
issuance of leers o himself
Secion 13G3 code of ciil procedure
proides ha if a person eniled o ad
miniser is a minor, leers may be
graned o his or her guardian  The
righs herefore of Mr Werley ; o leers
will be measured by hose ha would be
accorded o Ola G Werle were she of
lawful age and here peiioning for
leers in her own behalf
Counsel for Mr Werley hae cied
esae of McLaughlin 103 Cal, page 29
and esae of Engle, 12 Cal page 292,
o uphold he claim of Mr Werley o
leers Neiher of hese cases how
eer susain his posiion
ll ha 1 was decided in esae of
McLaughlin was ha he guardian of
he son of he deceden, who was he
only heir o he esae, bu had been ad
judged an incompeen person, was
eniled o leers in preference o he
public adminisraor The son being
he only heir was by he saue ; eniled
o leers, i was merely held ha he
guardian occupied he same posiion
ha he son would hae occupied, had
he no hae been adjudged incompeen
o manage his propery
In his case, he moher of Ola G
Werley being liing,, Ola, 'of course is
no an heir of Mrs Serine, and by he
express proisions of sec  1365 of he
code of ciil procedure a relaie is no
eniled o leers (unless he be an heir)
in preference o he public adminis
raor •
In said esae of Engle cied by coun
sel, leers were issued o one Griffih,
who was no an heir bu was eniled o
oneenh of he esae as deisee, and
he peiion of he public adminisraor
denied, bu ha was a foreign will and
he case was decided upon auhoriy of
esae of Bergin 100 Cal 376, where i
was poined ou ha he proisions re
laing o he appoinmen of an adminis
raor wih he will annexed of a foreign
will were enirely differen from ha re
laing o a domesic will, and ha leers
upon a foreign could be graned only o
a person ineresed in he will, and in
esae of Coan 132 Cal 03 boh he
cases of esae of Engle and esae of
Bergin were referred o and i was
shown ha he public adminisraor was
neer eniled o leers upon a foreign
will because he public adminisraor is
no a person ineresed in he wi11,
' Esae of Wakefleld 36 Cal page 110
seems o presen feaures much like he
case a bar
 Naomi Wakefleld and her moher
perished in he wreck of he seamer

cisco Nanomi died firs In a cones
for leers upon he esae of Naomi be
ween he nominee of her wo brohers
(who became eniled o he enire, es
ae of Naomi hrough he deah of he
moher and he public adminisrae^ )he
supreme cour held ha he nominee of
he brohers would be eniled o leers,
if he brohers were eniled, bu as a
he momen of Naomi's deah, her
moher was liing, her moher became
Naomi's heir, and ha leers should bs
issued o he puplic adminisraor no
wihsanding ha he brohers hrough
he deah of he moher migh be en
iled o disribuion of he enire esae
I is clear ha in his case he ex
ccurix'haing renounced her 'righ o
leers and he deceden haing died a
residen of his couny, he pubilc ad
minisraor would hae he prior righ o
leers wih he will annexed as agains
eery person exceping Mrs Nellie Wer
ley he moher of Ola G bu who has
no peiioned for leers
Since he hearing upon his cones
for leers, m aenion has been called
by counsel, o a paper filed wih he

purporing o be a reques on he par of

noified of he applicaion for leers
made by boh Mr Poer and Mr Werley Personal
