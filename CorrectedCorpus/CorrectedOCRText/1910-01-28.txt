couh lo of miners of pioneer days
each wih a reoler swinging close o
his side Passion alone guided his
howling boisrous hrong, ben, on
reenge and hirsing for he blood of
any and all of his ' murderous gang
The blood of he icims of he mas

Saved At Death's Door
The door of death seemed ready to
open for Murray W. Ayers, of Transit
Bridge N. V., when his'life was won
derfully saved. "I. was in v dreadful
condition," he writes, "my skin was
almost yellow; 'eyes sunken: tongue
coated; emaciated from losing 40
pounds, growing weaker daily. Viru
lent liver trouble ' pulling me down to
death in spite of doctors. Then that
matchless medicine-electric bitters
cured me. I regained the 40 pounds
lost and now am well and strong."
For all stomach, liver and kidney
troubles they're supreme. 50c at Spag
