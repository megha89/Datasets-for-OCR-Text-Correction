A BIASE SON OF ERIN
Hla Original Snifareation For En
larging O'Sulllan Caacade
In his "Becollectiops" Aubrey de
,Vere tells of an Irishman be met in
Switzerland with whom patriotism was
so truly a mania that eery word hi
praise of the scenery about him seemed
a distinct aspersion on the land of his
birth "What can you compare here,"
he demanded, "with the mountains of
iWicklowr 
"Perhaps," Bald a traeler, "one
might name the "mountains of the Mont
Blanc range"  
"Oh," he replied scornfully, "they're
out of all reason I lam after walking
nlong the Chamounl alley for three
days and I saw only four of those
mountains Sure, In Wicklow I'd hae
counted as many as eight of them in
three hours"
"Hae you seen this wonderful wa
terfall within half a mile of usr
"1 hae not seen It, and I am not go
ing to see It idn't I Bee the CSulll
an cascade at Klllarney? own It
comes from such a height that you
don't know where it comes from own
it plunges, thundering and bellowing,
sometimes black as ink and sometimes
white as milk, dashing itself against
the right band rocks and smashing It
self against the left hand ones What
Is your Handeck fall compared to
that?"J Personal     ,
"Some persons would say," was the
reply, "that the waterfall here is about
ten times as high and six times as
broad"
"Ah, then," said he, with an added
note of scorn, "then Utp O'Sullian cas
cade is not big enoufh for you? And
tell me this nowPersonal Couldn't you take a

Chinese Engagemeiita
A Chinese engagement dates its be
ginning from the exchange of red cards
between the parents of the contracting
parties These cards in many districts
are immense documents, almost the
size of a horse blanket They are im
portant for the reason that they are
used as eidence in case of disagree
ments in the future We seldom bear
hi China of broken engagements Yet
If a quarrel cannot be settled peaceful
ly recourse is had to the law, and the
Judge usually Imposes* a fine upon the
party who has broken the contract '
g The chief incident in a Chinese mar
riage is the arrial of the bride in her
bridal clothes before the bouse of her
chosen one That is a de facto fulfill
ment of the contract The wedding day
Is determined by the parents of the
groom The imperial calendar names
the lucky days, and on such days the
so called red celebrations take place,
both in the cities and country
The Leerage In n Screwdrier
, It is sometimes supposed by persona
Imperfectly informed in mechanics that
a long screwdrier gies grenter le
erage than a short one This,  bow
eer, is Incorrect The action of a
screwdrier, the pressure on which is
direct, is not in any way analogous to
that of a leer The superiority of a
long screwdrier rests simply on two
facts— first, you can generally get a
better grip on a long screwdrier than
on a short one and can bring the whole
weight of the body and strength of the
arms to bear on it, and, second, the tor
sion of the iron in a long screwdrier
comes in to supplement the force em
ployed The only way in which leer
age can come in is In connection with
the breadth of the point of the screw
drier, and een this counts for noth
ing beyond the breadth of the head of
the screw
An Irish Sqnlre'a Adice
 An upstart Irish squire went to an
old squire for adice as to sending a
challenge
1 "Healy of Loughlinstown," said he,
"has threatened to pull me by the nose
wheneer he meets me What would
you adise me to do?"
"Has he really used that threat?"
asked the squire
"He has"
"Well," said the squire, "I'll tell you
what to do— soap your nose well and
It will slip through his fingers"
Perhaps the most contemptuous dec
lination of a challenge was that of an
Irish gentleman of the old school
"Fight with him!" he exclaimed "I
would rather go to my grae without
a fight!"— Kansas City Independent

Schliemann found two bodies with
faces coered by masks of g01d One
of the masks represented the head of

mask was a sign of distinction With

Kindergarten and Cltlaenanlp
The kindergarten offers a special ad
antage — namely, the opportunity for
practice of citizenship before real ciic
duties present themseles Theory Is a
necessary preliminary to performance,
een when the doer is not sufficiently
enlightened in hla work to be aware
that he holds a theory But practice is
the test of theory Right here In the
kindergarten our sixyearolds are un
consciously testing theories of life
through problems which will arise,
willy nilly, een in a child's life, as
soon as that child begins to come in
contact with other children The chil
dren sole these problems for them
seles But the wise eye is upon them,
the suggestie word awaits their need,
the helping hand adjusts conditions and
proides the material for the children
to act against The master mind of the
kindergarten — for such it ought to be—
permits mistakes, it is true, but at the
same time It preents the fumbling ap
prentice from the discouragement of
the unnecessary stumble— Gunton's

'Wonderful Thing* In Heredity
It is a fact well established by stu
dents of heredity that children are apt
to inherit not only the physical, mental
and moral traits of their parents, but
to be influenced by their age as well
Children born of ery young fathers
and mothers neer attain so igorous a
growth of mind or body as those of old
er men and women, while children of
old people are born old
One of the most surprising cases in
medical history Is that of Marguerite
Cribsownn, who died in 17G3, aged 10S
years When ninetyfour, she was mar
ried to a man aged 103 Three children
came of this union, but they had gray
hair, no teeth, were stooped, yellow

A Tery Old Bat
Among the treasures in the safe cus

Its simplicity of make has been its
safeguard, for it has no nap or perish
able trimmings, such as moths might
corrupt It is closely akin to what Is
now known as a panama straw hat and
is of such excellent quality that it can
be folded or crushed without any barm
to its appearance It is also quite on
well adapted for practical use now as
it was in the days of the pharaobs

A LONG BENTENCE
One That laeonnted the Lonareat
One ESarta Eer Uttered
Abram 8 Hewitt had a ery nimble
wit and dearly loed a joke He was
once a guest at a dinner which Includ
ed Recorder Smyth and Senator E arts
The recorder was poking fun at the
senator and read from a newspaper
clipping what purported to be a sen
tence from a recent speech made by
the senator, but which was in reality
wholly fictitious, as the senator knew
quite well At its conclusion the laugh
was long and hearty at Mr Earta' ex
pense, and no one laughed longer or
heartier than the senator himself
! As soon as the laughter had subsided
Mr Hewitt suddenly leaned across the
table and, looking rather sternly Into
the smiling face of the recorder, said in
a well assumed tone of reproachPersonal
J'That certainly Is a remarkable sen
tence^ your honor, but criticism of It
does not come well from you if today's
newspapers are to be belieed, for they
contain aya  sentence of much greater
length which is attributed to you"
"Why— why, how Is that, Mr Hew
itt?" inquired the recorder, with con
siderable confusion
"Because," said Mr Hewitt with the
utmost graity and that grim smile
which always accompanied his best
sayings, "you are there quoted as ut
tering a sentence that was to last
through the whole life of the prisoner"

He knew the real facts could be had

Anlmala and Rain
It seems strange that no animal, un
less It be the squirrel, seems to build it
self a shelter with the express object
of keeping off the rain, which they all
so much dislike Monkeys are misera
ble in wet and could easily build shel
ters if thpy hnd the sense to do so "As
the creatures hop disconsolately nlong
in the rain," writes Mr Kipling in his
"Beast and Man In India," "or croucb
on branches, with dripping backs set
ngalust the tree trunk as shelter from
a driing storm, they hae the air of
being ery sorry for themseles" But
een the orang outang, which builds
a small platform in the trees on which
to sleep at night, neer seems to think

An Adantage From Foara
In speaking of fogs a medical Journal
draws some consolation from the fact
that een fogs hare one compensating
adantage which has often been oer
looked "It is," It says, "reasonable to
suppose that a fog effects a partial
purification of the atmosphere This ii
borne out by the fact that when a fog
subsides the deposits contain the car
bon, sulphur, organic bases and other
Injurious and irritating particles which
formerly existed In a state of suspen
sion in the atmosphere"

In theory Confucianism is the re

are the literati who hae secured theli
positions through the study of the
classics— L c, the "Sacred Writings oi
Confucius" The Confuclanlst temples
are protected and honored by the state,
•ml the worship of Confucius is carried
)n at the expense of the state In a
limited sense, too, Buddhism can also
claim to be a state religion The same
is also true of Taoism, since deceased
generals and statesmen are assigned
their corresponding ranks with the
Toolstic king of the lower world In
hades In this role they are worshiped
In Taoistic temples In this way it ll
possible for a Chinaman to make use
of all three religions without getting
Into conflict with the distinctie prin
ciples of any of them Their officials
worship together In funeral serice!
monks of both orders are fonnd per
forming functions on different days
The public temples are usually In
control of the Taoists, but sometimes
are in charge of Buddhists Not rarely
Taoistic gods are found in Buddhist
temples and ice ersa Sometimes
they differ only in name The Bud
dhist goddess of mercy is the Taolst
goddess of heaen The pearl king of
the Taoists is the imperial ruler of the
Buddhists Both systems teach the

A Powerful Rier
"Should one be asked at random to
name the most powerful rier in New

most water power and doing the mos<
work— he would be likely to name the

the great manufacturing city of Low

one It is surprising, \ therefore, to be
told by the United States geological
surey that the most powerful rier in
New England is the Androscoggln
Yet the surprise abates when the fact)
are recounted There are nine or ten
deeloped water powers along the ri

A  few months ago the Western
Federation of Miners of  ener'or
ganized a union This local association
elected as  its president a common ,
drunkard who had been twice In the
hospital for treatment for injuries re
ceied In saloon frays It had for ice
president and secretary two nonem
ployes of the company, the former a
barkeeper, the latter a barber and re
porter on a county paper One of its
executie committeemen I was, accord
ing to his boast, a "floater,'? and an
other was a man who , worked • but a
couple of months  in  the smelter and
who openly stated that he joinod for
what was in It; that he was out for the
job of organizer at $5 per day   '
1 These drunkards, grafters and non
employes gathered together a motley
crowd of men who were for the most
part of Latins, Slas and boys Subse
quently fie men were discharged for
neglect of duty  They had been on a
continuous spree | The ''union" with
out consulting the "allied interests,"
or the big majority of company's em
ployes, demanded the immediate rein
statement of those habitual drunkards
and the recognition of its order Both
demands were refused The "union"
was not a representatie body either
in the quantity or quality of its ; mem
bers  It had but a quarter of the em
ployes of the company In this minori
ty was only a ery small number of the
skilled or "old time" employes We
say that this body was neither respect
able nor responsible, and that what
eer It would do would be the oicing
of the mind and sentiments of the
radical, ignorant foreigners
On January 31st this strike ended
On February the 19th the "Union 143"
took up the question of reopening | the
strike but oted it down by a 58 to 41

T J Lewis, member the Executie
Board of the Western Federation of
Miners and its sole representatie in
this district, declared at the meeting
that be was opposed to another strike
because there was not sufficent cause for
one; that the Western Federation of
Miners would not tolerate or support
it 
Three days later, February 22, 1903,
the Western Federation of Miners of
ener ordered a strike without con
sidering the recent ote or further con
sidering the local "union''   Personal
The company was not in any way
hindered ob hampered in its operations
Only 87 members obeyed the order On
the other hand there are oer 500 men
working at the smelter and mine
In their propaganda the leaders and

other labor organizations, belittling
their power and influence and benefits,
casting slurs upon the ability and sin

Ancient Proofreading
The editions of books printed 200 or
200 years ago are almost entirely free
from typographical errors, which may
be' attributed to the fact that early
publishers were generally eminent
scholars, and themseles gae much
attention •to the reision of their
proofs After reading the proofs they
frequently turned them oer to other
scholars with the request to reise and
correct, and as the printer's time was
then deemed a matter of small conse
quence a perfection was attained which
is seldom equaled by modem printers

FRIAY APRIL 10, 1903
THE SALARY GRAB SCHEME
The effort to place the present
justices of the peace and constables
under the proisions of the salary
bill passed by the last legislature
has assumed two dierse phases dur
ing the past week Last Monday
these township officers put in their
claims before the superisors for
serices in criminal matters up to
the 19tb of March, that being the
date on which the new law went
into effect For serices since the
19th it was contended that they
were entitled to pay under the sal
ary act, and the allowance of sal
aries was clearly outside the pro
ince of the superisors Thereafter
W L Rose, elected justice of the
peace of township 4 on the demo
cratic ticket, sered a written
notice upon G L Gulbert as coun
ty auditor, requesting him to forth
with make out and delier to said
petitioner a warrant on the couuty
treasurer in the sum of $1733} in
payment of salary as justice of the
peace from March 19th, 1903, to
March 31st, 1903, both inclusie, ac
cording to the proision of the act
approed by the goernor March 18
The auditor refused to draw the
warrant The next step on the
program will be a mandamus suit in
the  superior court to compel the
auditor to issue the warrant This
is one phase of the salary problem
It must be borne in mind that Rose
is a democrat The board of super
isors is republican The only hope
of himself, and his brother demo
cratic officials of collecting under
the proisions of the bill, lies in a
straight out contest on the constitu
tionality of the law
But an entirely different phase
crops up before the superisors It
will be seen that J E Kelly, con
stable of lone, and  F Gray, con
stable of Sutter Creek, hae resign
ed as such officers It may be asked,
what is the meaning of this action
If the salary bill holds, the con
stableship is an office that will, not
go begging The resignation busi
ness is simply a moe to secure the
benefit of the salary without a con
test in court We were apprised
seeral days ago that a scheme was
afoot to hae the township officers
resign, and be reappointed by the
superisors They would on their
reappointment be relieed of all
obligations laid upon them by their
election to accept the compensation
as fixed by the then existing law
It is argued that the law in force at
the time of appointment would
goern in such cases It is a shrewd
moe to reap the benefit of increas
ed pay The two officials who hae
resigned occupy different positions
Kelly is a democrat, and was elected
at the last election to succeed him
self Gray on the other hand is a
republican He declined a renomi
nation, on the ground that the pay
was inadequate He continued to
hold the office as a holdoer
upon the failure of the one elected to
qualify, and the office was forced upon
him against his will There is there
fore some reason in his resignation,
with a iew to reappointment to bring
him under the proision of the new
law With Kelly it is somewhat
different In case of his reappoint
ment would be, haing been elected
under the old law, be entitled to the
increase of pay proided by the new
law 'If so, nothing becomes more
simple than the easion of the con
stitutional proision that salaries
shall not be increased during the
term for which an official was elect
ed Beside this, the board being re
publican, would Kelly bo reappoint
ed anyway Is it not likely that a
republican will turn up for appoint
ment, and get away with the plum?
Altogether, the situation is comical
enough, and tangled enough to re
quire more than one day in court to
straighten it out
AT SEA AS USUAL
Judging by what is heard on the
streets and what is published, tho Led
ger editor, who poses as the leader of
republicans, but who ia in reality so
politically blind that he cannot with
safety lead himself, will endeaor to de
feat the aims and objects of the new
salary law as pertains to this county
As it will be up to the superisors,
people are wondering whether the
wouldbe dictator can control that body
The Echo says no— lone Echo
The aboe seres to show how
hopelessly the literary genius of the
Athens of Amador county flounders
in misstatements wheneer he en
tures to strain his intellect by writ
ing an editorial of a couple of sen
tences in length In trying the
smart act he airs his own ignorance,
on a subject which he is expected to
be posted A man who misleads his
readers, when the means of correct
information is withi^ his reach, is
nothing more than a pererter of
the truth because he prefers to be
such If the distinguished Athenian
scholar had taken the trouble to
hunt up a copy of the codes he would
hae found the following section
therein concerning the permanent
powers of the board of superisorsPersonal
' 12" To examine, settle and allow
all accounts legally chargeable
against the county, except salaries
of officers
In faceof this wholesome proision,
the new salary law is not "up to the
superisors"" Its interpretation
and enforcement neer can be up to
that body It is a matter outside of
their jurisdiction Official salaries
are fixed t>y a higher power than
superisors, and it would be the
hight of absurdity, after adopting a
salary schedule, to refer the matter
to superisors for final determina
tion The bugaboo created by the
oerburdened brain of ourcotem
porary is thus effectually disposed
of Furthermore, the editor of the
Ledger is not posing, neer has
posed, and neer  will pose as the
leader of the republicans He is
dead set against all leadership in
the shape of bossism in the republi
can ranks The republican party is
not in need of leadership of that
character It can get along much
better without the aid of selfap
pointed dictators It will always be
the policy of the' Ledger to oppose
such schemes of leadership' With
this declaration, the balance of the
statements in the aboe quotation
falls by the wayside We trust our
amiable cotemporarywill not again
endanger his mental balance by en
turing beyond his depth
COUNTY PATRONAGE
 Unpleasant though the subject be,
we feel constrained to refer to the
action of the board of superisors
this week in declaring the Amador
Record the official paper — that is,
the medium through which adertise
ments ordered by the board shall be
published For two years the Led
ger in a nominal way has enjoyed
this distinction The patronage of
the board of superisors of Amador
county is probably less than any
other county of equal wealth and
population in the state Small as
it is, the Ledger has neer receied
it all Wheneer a notice had to be
published which concerned some par
ticular portion of the county outside
of the county seat, such notice has
usually been published in the paper
published within the boundaries of
the affected territory The proposed
incorporation of Sutter Creek may
be cited as a case in point That
notice — as profitable a one as any
published during the past two years
—was ordered published in the Rec
ord, notwithstanding thejact that
the paper oiced neither the iews
of the majority nor those of the su
perisor of that district To this
policy the Ledger neer raised a
word of protest, notwithstanding it
was a radical departure from the
course followed by the board during
the long period of democratic ascen
dancy
April is the month when the ad
ertising for proposals for supplies
of court house and hospital is or
dered Ordinarily the aderising for
that month amounts to as much as
for all other months combined It
has neer before been selected as the
time for making any change in the
official newspaper, and not the
slightest intimation of any contem
plated change, or any moement to
that end, reached the editor of the
Ledger from any source The whole
scheme was hidden away in the minds
of its concoctors, and those who lent
themseles so meekly in carrying it
into "execution" There was no op
portunity gien to offset the moe
ment in any way It was a star
chamber proceeding from its con
ception to its consummation We
mention this fact not merely in jus
tice to ourself, but to show what ex
alted ideals some people cherish
regarding the proper conduct of pub
lic business 
The proprietors ot lone Echo and
Sutter Creek Record, no doubt in
pursuance of a preconcerted ar
rangement, each forwarded a com
munication asking that his publica
tion be declared the official paper
Tuesday afternoon the chairman of
the board announced that an "exe
cutie" session was in order This
was an intimation for all spectators
to withdraw, that a secret conclae
was on tap This closeddoor custom
is an innoation of recent years
— one that would be far more hon
ored in the breach than in the keep
ing Who or what was executed at
this secret gathering we do not
know Upon again assembling i
open session, the democratic mem
ber from Plymouth, if you please,
moed that the Record be declared
the official paper Think of it No
question of a closer partisan charac
ter can arise than giing the county
adertising to the paper or papers
supporting the candidates of the
dominant party Such matters ought
to be settled by caucus of themem
bers of the party of the majority
emocrats would not inite repub
licans to participate in a caucus in
oling their party interests But
here we hae a democrat naming be
fore a republican board the official
paper of Amador county What a
spectacle for the stalwart republi
cans of Amador county to contem
plate If a democrat should nomin
ate other than a member of his par
ty for United States senator in a re
publican legislature, that act would
either be deemed sufficient to read
him out of his party, or be iewed
with such suspicion by the members
of the majority party that they
would consider it their" duty to fight
shy of such nominee They would
not only reolt at the idea of a man
outside their party lines assuming
to lead them on a political question,
but they would argua that the can
didate that was satisfied with a
democratic sendoff under such con
ditions, was not the right kind of
material to command republican
otes But the republican super
isor from township three played
the amiable role of seconding the
motion This was in accordance
with the eternal fitness of things
It was in keeping with the hybrid
policy mapped out, and the gobe
tween sheet they had mutually
decided upon as their mouthpiece
WM Amick of Tone, to his credit
be it said, had sufficient appreciation
of the situation to keep aloof from
THE AHABOB LEGER; JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FftIAY APRIL 10 1903
unseemly alliance The Record sig
nalized itself in the last campaign
by not merely failing to support
eery candidate for a county offlce
ou the republican ticket, but opeuly
adocated the opposing candidate?
The present proprietor of that sheet
has not been in the editorial harness
long enough to participate in a politi
cal campaign The success of the
plot was celebrated on the streets of
Jackson the same afternoon oer the
coniial glass and the congratula
tory handshake, but republicans were
conspicuous by their absence from
the jollification
The Ledger has been the unfalter
ing adocate of republican principles
and policies from the days of Lin
coln until ow It will contiuue to
support them, not because such, a
course has been profitable, but be
cause it is right Ten thousand in
stances of political ingratitude would
not cause us to eer one iota from
the path which we beliee to be
right We look for nought else than
misrepresentation and abuse from
political opponents But we did not
expect to be wounded and belittled
in the house of our friends We ex

perisors — regardless of their party
affiliations — for their latest achiee
ment i unwittingly crowning sore

The funeral of the late Mrs Christine
Hoffman took place from the family
residence in Jackson at 2 p m, Wed
nesday, April 8 The serico at the
house was conducted by Re G H
Van Vliet of the M E church Jack
son Rebekah Lodgo No 53, I O O F,
of which ordor tho deceased was a
worthy member, attended in a body,
and escorted tbo remains to tho grae,
administering tbo last sad rites which
tho liing can render to the deuTl The
esteem in which Mrs Hoffman was
held by the people  of Jackson and
icinity was manifested by the many
friendPersonal, who came to pay tribute to
her true character known to all "The
Qorul offerings wore many and beauti
ful, and the grae was entirely coered
with those tokens of loe and respect
The pallbearers were W F otert,
J H Langhorst, Jas Meehan, Chas
Meek, LPoggi, and L J Fontenroso
Mrs Hoffman, whose maiden name
way Christine Klamn, was born in
Baaria,  Germany, March 2, 1836
She came to California direct from tho
country of her birth, in May, 1861, and
was married at iamond Springs Sept
17th of the same year to Frank Hoff
man, who was a well known lieryman
of Jackson at that time, and who now
mourns the death of a good, true and
loing wife Those who knew Mrs
Hoffman during the many years whiob
she has lied in Jackson, can speak Personalof
her in words of kindnoss only Not
only was her home lifo an ideal one,
but her gentle influence caused all to
know her and to loe her The acts of
charity which she rendered to the poor
and neudy will eer bo remembered by
the many to whop she has gien aid,
and yet her charity was so modest tbat
her acts of beneolence were unknown
to many of hor dearest friends
' Mrs Hoffman had been a member of
Jackson Rebekah Lodge No 53 a good
many years, and had always been inter
ested in the welfare of the lodge, but
attended their gatherings ery little of
late Mrs Hoffman had been in feeble
health for seeral months  She has
not been out pf her house since the 9th
of September, when she came in town
to witness tho Natie Son's celebration
Heart failure was the direct cause of
her death, and while it was known that
her sufferings  were intense at times,
she was neer known to utter one word
of complaint While her death was
not unexpected it was a shock to her
husband and relaties She paused
away peacefully and quietly at her
home at 4Personal30 p m Sunday, April ' sth
Mrs Hoffman leaes a fond husband
to mourn her death, also a sister and
brother in Germany, a brother in
Cleeland, Ohio, three nieces in Jack
son, Mrs r Schacht, Christina Klamn
and Christina Rickert, and three
nephews, Anton Rickert, Will Kesler,
and Jacob Griesbach
A Sadden Mix Up
Sunday morning tho lone stage' was
spinning along at a Jjyely clip, and just
as the Morrow grade was reached 'one
of the lead horses went off his feet and
fell to the ground The trick was
turned so quickly that Chris didn't
hae a chance to gather up the lines,
and in an instant the horses were all
piled in a heap The stage was filled
with passengers, and they bad a good
scare, thinking another holdup was
the cause of the sudden halt When
the surprise of the moment was passed,
it was found that three of the horses
were down, and the fourth, a colt,
quietly standing, and eidently wonder
ing what it all meant With the aid of
tho passengers and "eacon" Peek,
the drier of the baggage wagon, the
team was unhitched, and after a few
niiuuto's delay were ready to start
Chris is unable to explain the action of
the horse that caused the trouble, as
he fell without stumbling pr giing the Personal
least warning that he was going'oiit of
business Strange to say, there wasn't
as much as a scratch on any of the
horses, and noue of them seemed to be
any the worse for their experience
The Case Against Adams
Jack Adams was arrested oer a
month ago for burglarizing the store
of F Cademartori, and stealing there
from oer $5 in small coin There was
a general indisposition to proseGUte pn
the grae charge of felony, this being
his first offense Mr Cademartori de
clined to swear out a complaint on the
subordinate charge of petty larceny
Sheriff Norman, if compelled to take
action, would only make complaint for
the graer charge In this dilemma
the matter has dragged along, until
the sheriff notified parties interested
that action would hae to be taken
inside of three days, otherwise he
would take up the matter This
brought things to a focus On Tues
day A Caminetti swore to a complaint
for petty larceny The defendant
ploaded guilty before Judge Goldner
the same day, and was fined 8100 or
100 days in jail He is still in jail
* Gie He a Smoke
A few days ago we heard a child of
tender ago say to a business man of
Jackson, "Gie me a smoke," The
juenile was dead in earnest, as was
eidenced by his manner as he begged
repeatedly and piteously for the weed
When asked his age, he said he was
eleen years old, and had been In the
habit of smoking for three years "The
habit had taken such a strong hold of
him, that he seemed actually suffering
for the wherewith to satisfy his cra
ing, as much so as a confirmed smoker
of adult years He was pale faced and
apparently delicate as might be ex
pected in one who had been a ictim of
the healthdestroying weed from in
fancy He said he attended school at
Jackson Gate, but his teacher had no
authority oer him except during
school hours How a boy of such years
manages to secure material to indulge
to such a degree in smoking is beyond
comprehension No doubt this is by
no means a rare occurrence It is a
sample of scores of cases that exist
hereabouts It shows a lamentable
lack of parental control No wonder
so many of our young men grow up
without ambition or aim in life when
such pernicious habits are permitted to
sap the ital forces' at so early a period

consisted of H Gobish, Sam Radoich,'
W  Ould, Geo Thomas and Q J;

The superintendents, were gien to
undorstynd that ah answer would be ex
pected to these demands in ten days
The ten days will expire next Sunday,
On the eening of that day the regular
meeting of Jackson Union will be held,
and the report of the committee re
ceied and action taken thereon
Explanatory of , the circumstances
which led up to this moe on the part
of the labor organization we ! may state
that a special meeting of JaeUsonUnion
was held Thursday night What tran
spired at that gathering we do not
know It is safe to say, howeer, that
the action taken the following day was
the outcome of the decision reached at
that meeting According to street ru
mor, about 60 members responded to
the call for the meeting, and gathered
in the hall on Court street to discuss
the weighty problenga inoled The
question pf a etrlke was brought up
The conseratie element was against
such action, but thoy were In the min
ority We are told that the rules of
organization require a threeforths ote
to order a strike They managed to
muster just tho number So in the
eent of the " demands " being refused
a strike of some sort is imminent W hat
it will amount to remains to bo seen
Citizens generally look upon it as ' a
bluff The temper of the people Is any
thing but friendly to the disturbance
of our main industry; although many
express relief that the labor question
has reached a crisis, and its determina
tion is in sight,
Wednesday eening Mr etert, the
superintendent, addressed the men
while they were changing shift, and
requested that "those who intended to
go out on a strike on Monday, if so
ordered by the union, to step to one
side, in order that the company might
know the amount of money that would
be required to pay them off, as It was
the desire to pay eery man in full to
date" The subject of union or non
union men was not mentioned Seen
men declared their intentions, and
stepped out as requested One of the
number remarkedPersonal "I don't see why
the other three don't come out, " from
which it might be inferred that there
were that many more members of the
union in the mine " The men that
stepped out wore all Slaonians, and
some of them had worked a Jong time
at the Zeila,
Mr Hampton, superintendent of the
Oneida, informed the Ledger that the
committee who waited upon him last
Friday were gien to understand that
they could expect no recognition from
him, adding further that he informed
them that one member of the com
mittee had been discharged from
the Oneida not on account of his
affiliations with the union It was for
other reasons, and under no circum
stances would he be reinstated Mr
Hampton also stated that as far as he
know his men were all satisfied, and he
expected no trouble
The Kennedy has discharged no men,
and none hae quit, although a rumor
was current that nineteen men had been
gien their timo We hae heard of
no action being taken one way or the
other at this mine
As a aftermath of the proceedings
aboe related, it was announced early
in the week that W P Earts, the
editor of the Minors' Union, had closed
his brief career in journalism, and de
parted for other fields The paper has
doubtless been run into the ground,
and stowed away for good F, M
Whitmore, who owns the printing ma
terial, was informed Tuesday that the

the demise of tho organ and tho de

CHINESE FESTIVALS
Blx Curious Feast ays That Usher
In tbe Ifew Year
The first day of the Chinese New
Year's feasts is called Bird's day (Kay
Vat) and is supposed to bring to mind
the utility jf the feathered tribes as
food On this day all orthodox Chinese
abstain from eating flesh, and they
sometimes obsere it as a day of fast
big The second day is og's day (Ku
fat) This day is especially held sa
cred to the canine hosts of tbe Flowery
Kingdom The Chinese, notwithstand
ing the fact that they eat the flesh of
the dog and esteem it a great delicacy,
honor their dogs more highly and take
better care of them than any other race
of people In eery large Chinese city
there is a workman whose sole trade is
that of making coffins for departed
canines
The third day, Hog's day (ChenYat),
is celebrated in honor of a hog that
onco drew a aluable manuscript out
of a bonfire of trash The fourth feast
Sheep's day (YaongYat), is honored in
memory of Pun Koon Venga, a shep
herd 'who _ clothed himself in leaes,
grass and bark of trees, refusing to
make use of any part of the sheep, ei
ther for food or clothing The fifth day
Is Cow's day (NewVat) This day Is
consecrated to the cow that suckled the
orphan who afterward became rich and
built tbe celebrated Temple of Cows
The sixth day is MaVat, or Horse day
and is set apart to call to mind tbe use
fulness of that noble animal
Notable Paintings
Probably the smallest painting eer
made was the work of the wife of a
Flemish artist It depicted a mill with
the sails bent, the miller mounting the
stairs with a sack of grain on his back
Upon the terrace where tbe mill stood
was a cart and horse, and on the road
leading to it seeral peasants were
shown The picture was beautifully
finished, and eery object was ery dis
tinct, yet It was so amazingly small
that its surface, so the story goes,
could be coered with a grain of corn
In contradistinction to this the lar
gest painting, exclusie of frescoes and
panoramas, is Tintoretto's "Paradise"
It is hung in the grand saloon of the
doges' palace at Venice and is 84 feet
wide and 34 feet high
Michael Angela's fresco in the Slsttne
chapel of the Vatican completely co
ers the aulted roof, which measures
183 feet In length and 43 feet In width
This painting delineates the creation of
man, 'his fall and tbe early history of
the world, with a reference to man's
final redemption and salation
Reassuring
"Oh, Harold," wailed the loely maid
en, in whose expressie features grief
and Indignation seemed to be strug
gling for the mastery, "how can I be
liee you in the face of all this eidence
of your perfidy and double dealing?
The letter to Blanche, in your own
handwriting; her photograph, found in
your possession; the fact, as told me by
a dozen witnesses and tacitly con
fessed by you, that you kissed her the
other eening when you were together
In the conseratory — how can you rec
oncile these things with your contin
ued professions of loe for me?" 
"All these things, darling," said the
hero of the story, the light of truth
shining in his dark brown eyes and the
Impress of sincerity stamped upon his
noble forehead, "will be satisfactorily
explained In the next chapter I"—Chi
cago Tribune
No Time to Read
"Pause, O youtli or maiden," wrote
Andrew Lang In tbe Windsor Maga
zine, "before yon accustom your lips
to this fatal formula, 'I hae no time to
readP You hae all the time which
for you exists, and it Is abundant
What are you doing with it— with your
leisure? Mainly, gossiping Our mod
ern malady is gregariousness We
must be In company chattering
"To be always with others, always
gregarious, always chattering, like
monkeys in treetops, is our ruling ice,
and this is tbe reason why wo hae no
time to read and why you see so many
people pass their leisure when alone
In whistling or whittling They hae
time to whittle" 
Leonardo da Vlncl
Leonardo da Vinci, the celebrated
Italian painter, sculptor and architect,
died in 1510 He was born in 1452 and
became well ersed In all the sciences
and arts of bis time His most famous
picture is "The Last Supper," painted
on the wall of a conent at Milan He
la said to hae anticipated Galilei,
' Kepler, Copernicus and others In their
; astronomical theories and also some of
[the discoeries of recent geologists,
though his iews are expressed In
somewhat ague language
BREAKING IT GENTLY
lie Showed the 'Widow Why It Was
Too Late to Mourn
After the ship which had come from
Xt>w Zealand was tied up at the wnurf
Larry O'lirien was told off by his ship
mates to call upon Mrs McCarthy and
break the news of the death of her hus
band, which had occurred on shipboard
the preceding summer The Brooklyn
Eagle tells how he did itPersonal
"Good morning, Mrs McCarthy I"
laid he "Is enny in?"
 "enny V said the surprised woman
•My enny? No, he's not in Is the
i bjp here?"
"Sure it is And enny's not got
home yet? That's quare— unless some
thing has happened him"
"What would happen him?" Mrs Mc
Carthy asked anxiously
"There's plenty of thugs can happen
a man," said Larry delicately "He
might hae got hurted or he might
hae took sick with the feer But
there's one comfort, as Father McGin
nls said once, and that is that time
heals i'ry grief"
"What do you mane, Mr O'Brien?"
"I mane that if anything happened
to enny you wouldn't feel  as bad
about it a few [ months after it hap
pened as you would right at the time,
would you?"'
• "I suppose not," Bald Mrs McCarthy
"I mind whin I lost me first husband I
thought I'd neer get oer it But, as
you say, in a few months it was alsler
to bear"
"Then, Mrs McCarthy, you'll be glad
to know that it's now four months—
nearly fie— since' enny died Sure, it
can't griee you now as much as It
would if you'd known It at the time"
Spain's Migratory Sheep
There are about 10,000,000 migratory
sheep In Spain, which each year trael
as much as 200 miles from the plains to
the mountains They are known as
transhumantes, and their march, rest
ing places and behaior are goerned
by special regulations, dating from the
fourteenth century At certain times
no one may trael the same route as
the sheep', which hae the right to
graze on all open and common land on
the way For this purpose a road nine
ty yards wide must be left on all in
closed and priate property The shep
herds lead their flocks, which follow
after and around The flocks are ac
companied by proision mules and by
large dogs to guard against woles
Tbe merino sheep trael 400 miles to
the mountains, and the total time spent
on the migration there and back Is
fourteen weeks
Bribery In Elections
Bribery in elections is an ancient 11
not an honorable custom This is shown
in the case of Shrewsbury, England
An extract from Parry's "Parliaments
and Councils of England" of a cajse of
bribery, with its punishment,' in 1571
shows how long the pernicious custom
has been in practicePersonal "Thomas Long, 'a
ery simple man and unfit' to sere, is
questioned bow he came to be elected
*He confesses tbafc be gae tbe mayor
of Westbury and another £4 for his
place They are ordered to repay this
sum, and a fine of £20 is to be assessed
on the corporation and Inhabitants, of
Westbury for their scandalous at
tempt" One can imagine the indigna
tion of those Inhabitants of Shrews
bury who rocele<l no bribe haing to
pay a fine for those who did
Qaeer Looking Worm*
New Zealand, Australia, the Samoan
and the Solomon islands, as well as
portions of the Hawaiian group, are
the homes of arious species of worms
with thick, heay bodies and with a
well defined neck connecting the body
with a head that Is a startling remind
er of that of the monkey ' In the Sand
wich Islands they are called "metaln
kl," which means "creeper with a
child's head" An old New Zealand leg
end say 8 that at one time they were
of Immense proportions and threatened
the extinction of all human life on the
Islands
Prudence and Preention
The following quaintly worded notice
is posted outside the offices of one of
the street car companies of ParisPersonal "We
beg to Inform burglars that we do not
leae money or aluables In any of our
depots during the night You are re
quested to make known this fact
among the confraternity, so as to aoid
unnecessary trouble and loss of time"
The newspaper which publishes the
aboe adds, "Prudence and preention
are the two mothers of safety" 
A Natural Mistake
He had recited to bis class the story
of Abraham entertaining angels una
ware Feeling that the children might
not know the meaning of the word "un
aware," he asked them if they did One
little band went up promptly, and the
smallest girl in the class saidPersonal

OING THE GRAN ENTRY
oty a Circus Horse Enjoys His Part
of the Performance
j ' ; experiences of a farm horse that
iPersonal • eetedly Joins a wagon show circus
in described by Sewell Ford in "Horses
Nine" Calico is the name of the horse
At night he has a hard time pulling the
baud wnpon oer the country roads, but
ho thoroughly enjoys his part in the
performance under the main tent The
enthor describes Calico's feelings as
followsPersonal
Ah, that grand entry! That was
something to lie for No matter how
bad the roads or , how hard the hills
hml beu Calico forgot It all during
thos9 ten delightful minutes when, with
his heart beating time to the rattattat
of the snare drum, he swung prancing
ly around the yellow arena
It all began in tbe dressing tent with
a period of confusion in which horses
were crowded together as thick as they
'could stand, while the riders dressed
ard mounted in frantic haste, for to be
late meant to be fined At last thertng
master clapped his bands as a sign that
all was in readiness There was a mo
mentary hush Then a bugle sounded,
the flaps were thrown back, and to the
crashing accompaniment of the band
the seemingly chaotic mass unfolded
into a double line as the horses broke
into a sharp gallop around the freshly
dug ring ,
Tbe first time Calico did the grand
entry he felt as though he had been
sucked into a whirlpool and was being
carried around by some irresistible
force So dazed was he by the music,
by the hum of human oices and by
the unfamiliar sights that he forgot
to rear and kick He could only prance
and snort He went forward because
the rider of the outside horse dragged
him along by the bridle rein Around
and around he circled until be lost all
sense of direction, and when he was
finally shunted out through the dress
ing tent flaps be was so dizzy he could
scarcely stand
The Candle Fish
One of the piscatorial curiosities of
the north i Pacific coast, especially plen
tiful along the shores of British Colum
bia, is the fish known to Indians, whites
and half breeds as the "candle fish"
To the scientists he Is the eulachon
(Tbalelcbthys paclflcus), and Is highly
esteemed for two reasons The fish it
self is about fourteen inches long, re
sembles the smelt In general appear
ances and is caught In large quantities
by west coast fishermen during tbe
months of February, March and April
It is the fattest of all fishes, for which
reason large' numbers of them are
dried and smoked to be used as a warm
Ing food during the long rigorous win
ters so common in that region
 Large numbers of them are also run
through crude presses, which extract
the oil This is presered in skin bags
and used much in the same manner as
whale's blubber is used by the Eski
mos This "candle fish" gets its com
mon name i from ; tbe fact that when
dried it burns with a bright white
flame until entirely consumed It is
much used by the "coasters" both of
Columbia and Alaska, either with or
without a wick passed through Its
body J; ;\;Personal
An Ancient Colt
One of Mrs Grant's faorite stories
was of an experience In camp some
where in the Adirondack^, when her
husband, then president for the first
term, wanted to get away from Wash
ington officialdom Mrs Grant was
bothered about the washing A guide
recommended a woman who had seen
better days, who lied a little way
down the lake Mrs Grant engaged
her Two days afterward she saw a
scene that, as she expressed it, re
minded her of  "Elaine" It was her
washerwoman paddling in a dugout be
hind a heap of snowy linen
"Less 'n a year ago," said the woman
apologetically, "I wouldn't had to 'a*
used the boat I brung it by the colt
But one day he jes' got colic or some
thin' and rolled oer on the grass and
died My, how we miss that colt! We'd
had him for twenty years"
The Cat and the oughnuts
This is a true story, says a writer,
that my grandmother told me about
her cat and dog She used to find the
coer off her doughnut jar, and also no
ticed that her doughnuts disappeared
One day she beard a noise and found
that the cat was on the shelf where the
doughnuts were kept Then it put Its
paw in the jar and drew out a dough
nut and pushed it off the shelf, and the
dog, who was looking up at the cat,
caught the doughnut in his mouth and
ate it When they found they were
caught, they acted ery guiltily' Personal
Why Frenchmen Are Small
It is said that the under size of the
French and their physical shortcom
ings as a nation are due for tbe most
part to the heay drain made upon the
race by Napoleon All the ablebodied
men were enrolled in his serice, lea
ing none at domestic or business pur
suits except the extremely youthful or
the aged From this drainage of the
blood and destruction of the sinew of
the race France has not yet recoered
