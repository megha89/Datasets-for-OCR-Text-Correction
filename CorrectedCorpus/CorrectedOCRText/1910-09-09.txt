WHT IS THE ISSUE?
Theodore Rooseel is caooring oer he counry making
poliical speeches o admiring housands I is his naure
o be before he foolighs He enjoys nooriey, and he is
cerainly geing, if no all he wans of i, a leas a surfei
from he sandpoin of indusrial peace and sabiliy The
principal heme of he expresiden's speeches is honesy in
public and official lifePersonal he is agains crooks whereer found
In shor, he is in faor of he righ and agains wrong,
wheher priae or official We can see nohing disinc
iely Rooseelian in such a declaraion He cerainly can
no claim any originaliy eiher in he idea iself or is ad
ocacy I is he same as righhinking men in all ages
and all naions hae conended for No one, excep hose of
he crooked class, will ake issue wih him on his proposi
ion There is nohing o jusify going ino hyserics oer
his; or he crowning of he redoubable colonel as he po
liical delierer The end aimed a is desirable, bu wha
definie and pracicable plan does he propose for is accom
plishmen? On his poin here is no new cureall i his
creed Indeed, here could be none, beyond he deerren in
fluence of laws for he proecion of sociey by he punish
men of wrongdoing — a remedy which is as old as he
human race Rooseel's speaking our is inerpreed as a
sep oward anoher erm as presiden The hough of his
candidacy will no help business ineress He is classed wih
he insurgen, or as he prefers o designae i, he "progres
sie," wing of he pary I is really he radical elemen,
of which senaor La Follee, Pincho and exsecreary Gar
field are he prominen exponens, as agains he conseraie
elemen, of which presiden Taf is he disinguished repre
senaie, backed by he solid commercial ineress of he
naion To describe he siuaion as beween progressies and
nonprogressies is misleading, and enirely ou of place
The sinceriy and parioism of eiher side are beyond ques
ion I is simply a difference of opinion as o which line of
policy will beer promoe he progress desired The repub
lican pary is now and always has been he pary of progress
Under he guidance of ha pary he Unied Sae hae pros
pered as no oher naion has eer prospered in a like period
of ime Some are disposed o beliee ha he amazing rap
idiy of deelopmen has no been an unmixed good I is
safe o say under republican rule we shall keep in he pah
of progress, no maer wheher his or ha facion of he
pary gains he asceudancy The rouble would begin if
hrough he facional srife, he real reacionaries — he dem
ocrric pary — should ge i he saddle, and gie us a ase
of heir pe schemes of progress
The proposed ciy ordinance, making radical changes in
he presen law goerning he reail liquor business in Jack
sou, was pu oer unil nex monh for dcce acion I
was no discussed a all a he meeing of he ruscs held
las week I may be safely assered, howeer, ha while
he records show merely a posponemen of he maer, he
ordinance will no be passed, as he rusees realize ha s
a dangerous measure in seeral respecs
The name of LincolnRooseel league, as he designaion
of he preailing facion in he primary elecion, will no
longer be heard of The organizaion has been disbanded,
and is membership merged ino he republican pary Tha
was cerainly a wise sroke of policy, ending o pary har
mony and success in he campaign now on
Congressman Englebrigh announces ha, if releced, he
will no oe for Cannou for he speakership of he nex

ha if he plan worked so charmingly
in he larger field, why no equally es

Damages Awarded
A decision rendered by third district
court of appeals confirms the judg
ment of the Calaveras county superior
court awarding A. E. Roberts $5760
damages against the Sierra Railroad
Company of California. Roberts was
injured on June 26, 1906, when a car
of dynamite on the train on which he
was riding exploded. He had pur
chased a ticket on that day, but missed
the regular passenger train, so with
the consent of the division superin
tendent began his journey on a freight
train instead. When the damage case
was heard in the lower court, the
superintendent claimed that Roberts
had agreed to assume all risks, before
he was given permission to ride on the
freight train. Roberts admitted as
suming all risks but contended that he
did not agree to be repsonsible for any
negligence of the railroad company,
and that it was negligence of the com
pany that permitted the train to be
derailed and subsequently caused the
explosion of dynamite. •

Pitiable Condition
Nick Kukovich, who was brought to
Jackson from his place of residence in
Amador, where he had been kept
under guard by relatives, owing to
his tendencies of becoming violently
insane, has grown decidedly worse in
his incarceration in the insane ward
here. A party of Austrians called on
the unfortunate man on Saturday
afternoon last, and used every effort
to try and have the victim divorce
some of his deluded ideas. At times
he became so rational as to be able to
speak a few words intelligently in his
native tongue.
The delusions of the victim are about
the most pitiable that were ever re
corded. As he sits in his padded cell
securely strapped to his cot he con
tinually works might and main until
his strength is exhausted, drilling im
maginary rock with a hand drill and
harrrmer. Then again he pulls on a
rope until he lays back tired out from
his exertions. At intervals he regains
his speech, and then cries that he is
caved upon and, must drill himself
out. He feebly cries he is far down
in a mine, and must save himself,
pointing to the slate colored walls of
his paddled cell, he said, ' 'See those
walls of rock, " and then he went on
drilling as only a maniac could.
A kindhearted Austrian had brought
him a bag of grapes, but he failed to
recognize them, and only ate them
when they were fed to him.

THE VOICE
If I were a voice— a persuasive voice —
That could travel the wide world
through,
I would fly on the beams of the morn
ing light,
And speak to men with a gentle might,
And tell them to be true.
I'd fly, I'd fly, o'er the land and sen,
Wherever a human heart might be,
Telling a tale or singing a song
In praise of the right— in blame of the
wrong.
If I were a voice— a consoling voice —
I'd fly on the wings of the air;
The homes of sorrow and guilt I'd
seek,
And calm and truthful words I'd
speak,
To save them from despair.
I'd fly, I'd fly, o'er the crowded town,
And drop, like the happy sunlight,
down
Into the hearts of suffering men,
And teach them to rejoice again.
If I were a voice— a convincing voice —
I'd travel with the wind;
And whenever I saw the nations torn
By welfare, jealousy or scorn,
Or hatred of their kind,
I'd fly, I'd fly, on the thunder crash.
And into their blinded bosoms flash.
And, all their evil thoughts subdued,
I'd teach them Christian brotherhood.
If I were a voice— a pervading voice —
I'd seek the kings of earth;
I'd find them alone on their beds at
night,
And whisper words that should guide
them right,
Lessons of priceless worth.
I'd fly more swift than the swiftest
bird,
And tell them things they never heard,
Truths which the ages for aye repeat,
Unknown to the statesmen at their
feet.
If I were a voice— an immortal voice —
I,d speak in the people's ear;
And whenever they shouted "Liberty"
Without deserving to be free,
I'd make their mission clear.
I'd fly I'd fly, on the wings of day,
Rebuking wrong on my world- wide
way,
And making all the earth rejoice —
If I were a voice — an immortal voice.

Don't Break Down.
Severe strains on the vital organs,
like strains on machinery, cause
break-downs. You can't over-tax
stomach, liver, kidneys, bowels or
nerves without serious danger to your
self. If you are weak or run down, or
under strain of any kind, take Electric
Bitters the matchless, tonic medicine.
Mrs J. E. Van de Sande, of Kirkland,
111., writes: "That I did not break
down, while enduring a most severe
strain, for three months, is due wholly
to Electric Bitters. " Use them and
enjoy health and strength. Satisfac
tion positively eruaranteed. 50 cents
at Spagnoli's drug store.
