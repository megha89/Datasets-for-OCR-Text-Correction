The" Tranquil Hind
Who does not loe a tranquil heart, a
weet tempered, balanced life? It does
not matter whether It rains or shines
of what misfortunes come to those pos
sessing these blessings, for they are al
ways sweet, serene and calm
That exquisite poise of character
which we call serenity is the last lesson
of culture; it is the flowering of life,
tho fruitage of the soul
It is as precious as wisdom, more
to be desired than gold— yea, than een
fine gold How contemptible mere
money wealth looks in comparison
with a serene life— a life which dwells
In the ocean of truth, beneath the
waes, beyond the reach of tempests
In the eternal calm!
Personal How many people we know who
Bour their lies, who ruin all that is
sweet and beautiful by explosie tem
pers, who destroy their poise of charac
ter by bad blood! In fact it is a ques
tion whether the great majority of peo
ple do not ruin their lies and mar
their happiness by lack of self control
How few people we meet in life who
are well balanced, who hae that ex
quisite poise which is characteristic of
the finished character! — Success
Taking a Chance
He looked happy enough as he
walked up to the postoflice box, set a
huge bundle on the floor and began
taking pretty square enelopes there
from, dropping them by twos and
threes into the box
"Big lot of letters," remarked the
policeman "Nice day too"
"Letters!" said the happy man "My
dear fellow, these are not letters
They are wedding initations"
A stern look came oer the face of
the hitherto friendly policeman
"My friend," he said, "I am sorry to
disturb you, but I must do my duty
Come with me"
"On what charge, sir? This is an
outrage"
"Not at all You arc adertising a
lottery through the post"

iscomforts of RHning Before the
ny Lamp Was Lit
The difficulties under which • coal
mining operations were carried on be
fore the scientist ay had Inented his
Safety lamp must hae been ery great
In many times the only alternatie the
mediical miner had to pitch darkness
was the phosphorescent gleam from
dried fish The miner's Implements,
originally of stone or hard oak, gradu
ally Improed, but he was forced to
workin almost complete darkness until
81r Humphry ay by his remarkable
Inention enabled him to light his way
through the tunnels he had excaated
with comparatie safety
Agricoln, nn author who wrote about
the middle of the sixteenth century,
has left an elaborate treatise on coal
mining as it was practiced during the
middle npres From this we learn that
the horse which suries to the
present day in some of the mining dis
tricts of Great Britain and northern'
Europe, was the engine chiefly em
ployed both for lifting the coal and for
getting rid of the water This latter
object was also sometimes effected by
means of pumps turned by windmills
or by tunnels drien with great labor
to an outlet at a lower leel
Tombs ok tlie Ancient Prophets
There exist in parts of Islam many
tombs of the prophet aniel Of these
one of the most celebrated is at Cairo
This fact need not astonish us The
Mussulmans admit without hesitation
the duplication or een indefinite mul
tiplication of the bodies of holy per
sons without their eneration for each
of the remains being diminished in the
least It is worth noting that the na
ture of the honorary qualifications ac
cordod to the same saint aries in dif
ferent countries Thus, for example,
aniel has at Cairo the name of Neb
bianlel—that is, they gie him the
title of prophet, as being at the same
time that which suits him best aud is
the most honorable they can confer In
Algeria or Morocco — feudal countries—
tho title they gie to saints is sldi,
which signifies lord, which is also the
title there of military and political
chiefs In central Asia' they gie to
those canonized persons whom they re
spect most, as to the prophet aniel,
the title of khodja, which means In

Making Blarble Out of Chalk
In nature marble is made out of
chalk by water which percolates
through the chalky deposits, dissoles
the chalk particle by parties and
crystallizes it mountain pressuresolid
ifying it It has been found that simi
lar results may be accomplished by
chemical means First slices of chalk
are dipped in a color bath, staining
them with tints that will imitate any
kind of marble known For this pur
pose the same mineral stains are used
as are employed in nature For exam
ple, to produce counterfeit "erde an
tique" oxide of copper Is utilized In
like manner green, pink, black and
other colorings are obtained Next the
chalk slices go into another bath, by
which they are hardened and crystal
lized, coming out to all intents and
purposes real marble
A Good Policy
The ry Goods Economist says of
one store with which it is familiarPersonal
"Eery employee in it seems to be
good natured Why should there be
any difference In this respect between
this establishment and the aerage
store? Is not human nature about
the same the world oer? True, but
there Is a difference The proprietor
of this store is not only a merchant
but a gentleman He treats his em
ployees with marked courtesy and con
sideration As a consequence they
feel so kindly disposed toward him and
bis business that their good will is re
flected In their treatment of his cus
tomers" Some storekeepers neer find
out why It Is that so few of their
casual customers become regulars
Leigh Hunt's Breakfast Bouquets
Leigh Hunt that early day aesthete,
declared breakfast to be the meal of all
others when the poetic influence of a

tecting bars of a park railing or city
square if he could find nothing more
beautiful, and with these to look at his
fancy took him roaming out into bound

BESTE THE PARSON^
A Case Where the Wedding Ring
Went on the RiKht Hand
A clerical correspondent of the Lon
don Express tells of a wedding cere
mony in which he officiated and In his
zeal for rubrical obserances laid him
self open to a comical and crushing
retort
"I was then curate of a small coun
try parish in Somersetshire, and one
day a couple presented themseles
after due preliminaries for marriage
in the illage church
 "Ail went well until the moment
came when It Is directed by the rubric
that the man shall place the ring upon
the fourth finger of the woman's left
hand, but then trouble began The
yokel, apparently from nerousness or
Ignorance, laid hold of the right hand
of his expectant bride and placed the
ring there isolutely
; " 'No,' I said, with quiet firmness,
'you must put the j ring on her left
hand' To this his only reply was a
stolid stare Thinking he had not un
derstood me, I repeated my words, but
with no belter effect
"With as much warmth and in
sistence as was justified by the occa
sion I now took firmer ground and
said, 'If you do not put the ring on
her left baud, I must stop the ser
ice'
"And then the climax came With a
complacent smile, that seemed to show
his satisfaction at haing for the mo
ment 'bested' the parson, the bride
groom settled the point for all time
with the words, 'Please, sir, she ain't
got none!' "
How Billiards Were Inented
The English are ery fond of tho
game of billinrds, and a letter i the
British museum gies the origin of the
sport It was inented by a London
pawnbroker, whose name was William
Kcw Kcw not only lent money, but
he sold cloth, and for the latter pur
pose had a yard measure, with which
he used to compute the amounts One
day to distract himself he took the
three round balls which are the em
blems of his trade— they may still be
seen in front of certain shops in Lon
don — and, placing them on his counter,
began to hit them about with his yard
measure
 He found it made a pretty game He
got a kind of skill in making one ball
glance "off the other, and his friends
who saw him thus employed called the
game Bill's yard It was soon short
ened into billiards But the yardstick
was the instrument with which the
balls were knocked about, and difficul
ty arose as to what to call it They
called it after the name of the pawn
broker—a Kcw— Paris Figaro

Why the Audience Laughed
At a public entertainment recently a
conjurer had an experience which was
highly comical, though quite disastrous
from a professional point of iew
Haing produced an egg from a pre
iously empty bag, he announced that
he would follow up this trick by bring
ing from the bag the hen that laid the
egg This little arrangement he left to
his confederate to carry out He pro
ceeded to draw the bird from the bag,
but what was his surprise on finding
that the alleged hen was an old rooster,
which strutted about the stage with
ruffled feathers and offended dignity
and set up as igorous a crowing as if
it had just awakened from its noctur
nal slumbers
The whole audience shrieked with
laughter, and the unfortunate conjurer
made a bolt for the dressing room, jg
The Tnnibleweed
The tunibleweed is a curious plant,
indigenous to the western prairies It
grows in all directions from a central
stem, making a large flat head, close
to the ground In the fall, after being
touched by the frost or dried, by the
weather, the stem breaks off, the head
becomes the sport of the wind and Is
drien oft across the prairie, scattering
seeds as it goes and finally bringing up
against some obstruction which arrests
its progress These weeds hae been
seen piled ten feet high against a
fence, drien there by the wind

WOUL ABOLISH TARIFF UTIE{»
Our democratic cotemporary, in
line with traditions of the political
party to which it belongs, comes out
•flatfooted in faor of the abolition
of the tariff The democratic party,
about election times, is
apt to deny the impeachment that it
is the party of free trade But as
soon as smoke of battle clears away,
with the democracy in its customary
role of defeat, the writers of that
persuasion throw off the mask, and
"show themseles in their true colors
—as the adocates of free ; trade
Tone it down as' they please, by call
ing it under arious names, such as
tariff for reenue only, raw material
Personal and the necessaries of life free, and
 a lot of similar hairsplitting distinc
" tions, the predominant idea of free
' trade is unmistakably present, and
the controling factor in shaping their
iews Last week the ispatch pre
sented the ideas of one Hazard Steens
on how the tariff ought to be re
formed The article contains nothing
new It is the same old song that
, has been sung oer the drooping
fortunes of democracy for lo! these
many years, but it seres to show
that notwithstanding all their trim
ming to meet the popular sentiment,
at bedrock, they cling to the played
out doctrine of free trade This
eminent writer on the dominant po
litical question, claims that customs
duties ought to be abolished on the
following articles, because in some
cases American made goods are sold
abroad cheaper than at homePersonal Iron
and steel, copper, lead and paper,
boots, shoes and leather On the
following mentioned articles the
tariff ought to be remoed for the
reason that they are classed as raw
materialPersonal Wool, hemp, flax and jute;
hides, furs and hair; coal, ores, lum
ber, wood pulp, salt, borax, chemi
cals, paints and oil This is certain
ly a rich schedule of raw materials
Just fancy, chemicals, paints and
oils being placed in this category
Then again fish, animals, meats,
sugar, also tropical fruits, and all
kinds of agricultural products are
 also to be transferred to the free
list according to this apostle of re
form It is not a reduction of tariff
that he wants, because, as he says,
the lowering of duties tends to in
crease rather than reduce the re
enue It is the wiping out of the
duties altogether that he coatends
for With this formidable list ex
empt from tariff exactions, it "is
difficult to see what products of con
sequence would remain for the rais
ing of any reenue worth speaking
of The occupation of the army of
customs officers would be gone
Notwithstanding all their double
faced professions about election
'times — and it will be remembered
that during the last election we had
a sample of how democratic stump
speakers can preach republican doc
trine of protection to suit circum
stances — democracy is the same on
 this ital issue as it was in the day
of Cleeland, Mills, and other tariff
tinkers of the free trade combine
Tariff smashers hae been in the past
the smashers also of industrial pros
perity, and we beliee it will be a
long time before the people of the
United States will gie them an op
portunity to ply their ruinous call
ing in the halls of congress or
executie mansion again

UPHOLING THE BOYCOTT
Of all tho resources of organized
labor, tho boycott is one of tho most
effectie retaliatory measures Of
course it is regarded as a most iniqui
tous measure by those who aro not
amenable to reasoning, and are made
to feel tho force of that silent, forceful,
cogent expression of popular feeling
The right of one person to abstain
from patronizing an indiidual, firm or
corporation, cannot bo denied That
same right is enjoyed by one hundred
persons, or any other number, tho
Amador Lodger to tho contrary not
withstanding
Thus speaketh the Tuolumue Pros
pector No doubt this adocate of
the boycott — the most cowardly de
ice eer conceied to enforce the
barbaric doctrine of "might is
right" — imagines the argument is a
clincher, and effectually disposes of
the question The reasoning, how
eer, is fatally defectie The right
of one indiidual to patronize one
tradesman exclusiely, or to refrain
from patrouizing auother, is not
denied When an indiidual wants
to buy an article, he must of nec
essity single out some particular
place to purchase He cannot be
stow his faor upon eery business
house in towu dealing in that line
He is compelled therefore to exercise
his right of showing preference for
oue place, or go without the article
This right is part and parcel of Iris
indiidual liberty It cannot be
taken from him without sacrificing
those fundamental principles of
freedom guaranteed by the consti
tution One man in the exercise of
this inalienable right gies prefei
eoce to oue business house; another
in the exercise of the same right,
and uninfluenced by any outside
considerations, confers his faors in
the shape of patronage upon auother
tradesman; and so the business
world moes, and all manage to get
along We do not dispute the prop
osition that this same right of indi
idual preference is enjoj'ed by one
hundred or more persons We go
further than that and say that it is
the priilige of eery man under a
free goernment He cannot get
away from this condition if he want
ed to There is no merit in the
exercise of his choice to deal where
he pleases; there is no demerit in
his passing by a score of business
houses, and his selection of one
faorite He can't help himself
Any law that would attempt to sn
fringe upon this right of preference
would be tyranny of the worst kind
But this is teetotally different from
the spirit of the boycott It is not
true as a legal proposition that what
one man has a right to do as a unit,
one hundred persons hae the same
right to do in concert, especially
where the predominating motie
underlying the concerted action 5s
to either ruiu a fellowman in his
business or coerce him into compli
ance with the wishes of the con
spirators This is the spirit of the
boycott It aims to deprie a man
of his right to "Hfe liberty and the
pursuit of happiness" It says ir
tually, you must do business accord
ing to our notions, or you will not
be permitted to do business at all
It is just as criminal in its spirit as
though it were decreed in secret
council to kill or maim the indiidual
If there is no law to reach this sort
of conspiracy, it is high time a
statute was placed on the books to
that end But it has already been
declared illegal, and only extremists
pf the ultra type will now undertake
to defend the obnoxious business
Labor unions will hae to moe off
this dangerous ground if they w'sh
to command the respect of enlight
ened opinion

slow rate of increase; by no 'rneatis

Bad Indeed
Losing flesh is indeed a bad sign
Take Scott's Emulsion for it For
weak digestion, for defectie nourish
ment, for consumption, take Scott's
Emulsion It restores flesh because it
strikes to the cause of the loss
The great strike at Keswick is a
thing of the past, and both sides are
jubilant and apparently satisfied
The truth is the company resumes
work on the terms they laid down
to the striking workmen in the first
place Union men will not be dis
criminated against, and nonunion
men will be employed if the company
pleasesto employ them The whole
trouble has ended in both parties to
the contest assuming the same posi
tion they occupied before the strike
was inaugurated

MOVING FOR REFORM
Superisor Grillo is "anxious to
brt'ii' away from the method of put
ting in bills for road work which has
preailed in this county for years,
and which the Ledger has repeated
ly called attention to as being in
conflict with law We refer to the
practice of lumping all items for
road work in one bill, and allowing
the same to the road commissioner
iustead of to the parties actually
performing the work This week
Grillo presented his first bill for
road work Ho wanted the items
entered ou the minutes, which, how
eer, was not done, for the "reason
we presume that the account i the
aggregate was sworn to by super
isor Grillo aud not by the parties
themseles, ln fact his bill differed
in no respect from the other road ac
counts, and hence it followed the
course of the others We trust,
howeer, that he will follow his ac
tion up by putting in his itemized
bills hereafter sworn to by the
claimants themseles, and we hae
no doubt they will, then go on
record in the minutes and be pub
lished as a part' thereof It is
worthy of note, that the bills for
road work under the system in ogue
i Amador count}', are allowed and
paid without the district attorney's
indorsement thereon He does not
indorse them as legal, neither does
be brand them as illegal Another
peculiar feature is that the warrants
against the road funds hae not
been cancelled by the superisors
the same as other warrants In our
statement of warrants conceited in
connection with the superisor's
proceedings, the road funds do not
figure at all So we are informed it
has been right along Why this
exception ?
Amador county contains 632 square
miles of surface area It is one of

PIPE BREAKS AT ELECTRA
Entire System at a Standstill
Early this morning one of the main

residence, and about 1000 feet up the
hill from the plant As soon as the
break was discoered the water — which
at the point of breakage carries a
pressure of 650 pounds to the square
mch — was immediately shut off at the
mouth of the tunnel, near the top of
tho hill A force of men hae bein
sent to the scene, and are now busily

of his young manhood to California,
and helped to lay the foundation of this
common wealth
That as a pioneer of Shasta and
Ainador couulies he was one of the
creators of the heritage bequeathed us
by that immortal band of empire
builders That as a member of the

His complaint alleges that for forty

On the 20th of January defendant ob

First Recruit for State Prison
Sheriff Norman made his first trip
with a prisoner sentenced to sere a

urday On that day ho took down to
Folsom prison James  H Hoskins, to
sere a term of 14 years for burglary of
the Mint saloon in Sutter Creek on the
morning of January 21st He pleaded
guilty to the charge, and receied the
aboe stated sentence Tho penalty is
differently regarded— some being in
dined to look upon it as somewhat
seere It was an exceptional case,
howeer He had just been liberated
from the county jail, and bad scarcely
got settled down to his recoered
liberty when he made this new break
in crime Although young In years —
being about 20— he showed clearly that
he was criminally inclined, robbing his
own home when he found that the
booty from tho burglarized saloon "was
not equal to his ependthritt inclinations
The fact that be pleaded guilty, to the
charge did not tell in mitigation of the
offense All things considered, wo
think it will hae a salutary effect in
doaling out punishment without stint
to those who are disposed to adopt a
criminal career The young man took
the sentence without showing much
feeling lie hardly realized the life he
had before him for tho next decade
With all credits for good behaior, he

Since our last report rain has fallen
in Jackson as measured by the Ledger
office gauge, as followsPersonal
January 31Personal 0 40
February 1 ']\\ q^SI
February 2 ;  010
Feb 3 01 l
Total ; i 22
Total for season to date " 1573
Same period last year 1312
While tho rainfall is more than two
inches greater than last year for the
cgrresppuding pcriod,still it is hardly
probable that the precipitation of last
season' will be oxeeeded in the outcome
It must be remembered that February
of last year was the wettest month of
the season, oer eight inches falling
that month, with fifteen days of rain
It was the longest spell of continuous
rains we hae experienced for many
years Oer seen inches fell after the
8l hof the month It is not at all
likely that such a record will be equaled
this year, especially after the heay
rains of tho past month

When Gluck composed his Immortal
works, a bottle of champagne was al
ways placed on either side of the piano,
and its efferescence helped to inspire
the great arias of "Iphigenia," "Armi
da" aud "Alceste" When the final re
hearsals were held of the "Iphigenia,"
Gluck liad not yet written the melody
to the "ance of the Scythians',' Na
erre, the ballet master, becoming un
easy oer tlie delay, went to him one
morning to urge him to hurry |it up
As he entered the composer's anteroom
be heard unusual and terrific noises
emanating from Gluck's library He
approached stealthily aud through a
crack in the door saw Gluck in shirt
6leees, his face as red a& fire and dis
torted by horrible grimaces, singing,
gesticulating and jumping about like a
madman Xa erre, frightened by the
extraordinary spectacle, pushed the
door open "Ah, there you are," ex
claimed Gluck "I am just finishing
your dance and will let you hae it
right away" It was then that Gluck
had composed that grand orgy, of the

In the SprtngtJeld Republican saysPersonal "At

tose figures in the morgue with their

The Guillotine and Its Inentor
One of tlr> most widely disseminated
of popular errors is that r Guillotin
inented the grim machine which still
bears the name The real inentor of
this sinister contriance was r
Louis, a well known medical man and
permanent secretary of the Parisian
School of Medicine, or Academic de
Medicine ,"
r Guillotin, who died in 1814, ener
getically but ainly protested against
the use of his name in connection witli
this disagreeable subject — an eidence
if one were wanted, of the great difli?
culty there is of correcting a popular
error Needless to say that the legend
that r Guillotin was among the ic
tims of his friend's ingenious and mer
ciful instrument of destruction is
wholly apocryphal He died at a good
old age ami in his bed, surrounded by
his children, who, howeer, obtained
permission to change their name
Ontnnrd Show In Italy
All oer Italy social life is character
ized by a great loe of outward show
Here is an anecdote which Mr Luigi
Villari relates in "Italian Life In Town
and Country" to illustrate this national
feelingPersonal
An American gentleman who was
spending the winter in Naples had
taken a flat in a palazzo, the first floor
of which was occupied by a noble fam
ily in somewhat reduced cfrcum
stauces He noticed to his surprise that
eery day he met a serant going up
or down the stairs carrying a pair of
carriage doors At last the mystery
was explained The said noble family
shared a carriage with some other peo
ple, but each had its own doors with
the family coat of arms, to make their
friends beliee that they both had
carriages
Moqnl Village Criers
Among the picturesque features of
life in tlio Moqui illages are the town
criers, who take the place of the daily
newspapers in ciilized communities
There are two of these functionaries,
one representing the '•hostilea" and the
other the "friendlies," the opposing po
litical parties in the Tusayan illages
Twice a day these officials ascend to
the housetops and, wrapped in their
scarlet blankets, their figures outlined
against the clear blue sky, call out in
long drawn, resonant tones whateer
announcement or record of town hap
penings may be in order

Slier In Potstoes
In peeling potatoes It Is often ob
sered that the outer fleeh of the tuber
contains brown sliers extending from
the surface inward to the depth of
about oneeighth of an Inch These sil
ers do no harm except to slightly injure
the appearance of the cooked potato
Usually then* location is Indicated ex
ternally by a minute puncture In the
skin In some cases each siler %s sur
mounted by a pronounced eleation,
and tubers so affected are called pim
ply potatoes 
The silers aud accompanying pim
ples are caused by minute white
worms, the lara; of the common flea
beetle, which bore into the tubers while
they are growing Naturally silers
are most common In potatoes in locali
ties where flea beetles are most abun
dant It is likewise plain that to pre
ent the appearanco of sliers In the
tubers it Is necessary to preent flea
beetles from attacking the tops This Is
best accomplished by spraying the
plants ery thoroughly with bordeaux
mixture containing parts green at the
rate of about twele ounces to flfty gal

Chinese Anatomy
Chinese physicians hae some curious
notions In regard to human anatomy
The truth Is they know nothing about
aimtoniy ns that word is understood by
American physicians, their principal
authority on the subject being a work
entitled "Neitjlng," of which Huang
Ti, who lied from 2007 to 2597 B 0,
is said to be the author
According to Chinese physicians, the
human heart occupies almost the same
position as Is assigned by European
and American physicians to the stom
ach, and bile, they maintain, has Its
origin in the back of the head They
also claim tlmt a human being has 365
bones, '  < rrespond to the 3C5
days of the year; that a' man has
twele ribs and a woman fourteen and
that a man's skull is composed of eight
and a woman's six pieces
Moreoer, they say that In eery hu
man body there are twentytwo parts
which are important and fiftysix
which are unimportant, and they lay
great stress on the necessity of taking
good care of the Important parts
Korean Schools
In Korean schools the master is
dressed in white, generally wears spec
tacles and always has a rod in order
that the child may not be spoiled He
gathers his flock around him In the
most fatherly manner and deals out
justice with an unsparing hand The
scholars ore dressed in their best, but
must study without their shoes These
latter are kept In sight of the master
at all times The course of study Is not
ery extensie to look at, but when it
comes to studying the Korean language
through the medium of Chinese it must
be confessed that the beginning of a
course Is difficult The scholar is first
taught the name ami meaning of Chi
nese characters and then their meaning
in Korean, just as though he were
obliged to Inarn English through the
medium of the Greek alphabet Stu
dents keep up a steady droning noise
as each one goes on repeating his por
tion of the tasks aloud, regardless of
what is going on round him
Ant**' Magnetic Nests
Port arwin, in South Australia,
boasts of some of the most remarkable
ants' nests in the world They are
known as "magnetic" nests, for the
simple reason that they are without
exception built in a due north and
south direction Consequently a tra
eler journeying through the district in
which they abound may readily direct
his course by their aid No liing man
knows why these tiny architects build
them in this way They are merely one
out of the many marels of the great
land "down under" It seems, how
eer, "probable that instinct leads these
tiny' creatures to so construct their
dwellings that the fierce noonday sun
shall hae the least possible effect upon
their interiors
Tnlkins Through the Body
To talk through a human body, or a
row of human bodies, for the matter of
that, is one of the weirdest of the elec
trician's feats If a telephone wire be
seered and the two ends be held by a
person, one in each hand, but far
apart, it is quite possible for two Indi
iduals to carry on a conersation
through the body of the medium as
readily and as distinctly as if the line
had been properly connected
A Woman's Ileart
Let men tremble to win the hand of
woman unless they win with it the ut
most passion of her heart Else It may

ALMACK'S OF LONON
A Fuiuouh Woman's Club of a On
tary or So Ago
About a century ago the seenth
heaen of the fashionable world of
London was a club known as Almack's,
of which the patronesses were Lady
Cast kreagli Lady Jersey, Lady Cow
por (afterward Lady Palnierston), Lady
Sefton, Mrs rumuiond Burrell (after
ward Lady Willoughby), the Princess
Esterbazy and the Countess Lieen
Their smiles or' frowns consigned men
aud women to happiness or despair It
Is hard for us to conceie the Impor
tance wbich was attached to getting
admission to Almack's Of the 300 onl
cers of the Foot guards not more than
half a dozen were honored with cards
to this temple of the beau monde The
goernment was a pure despotism, as
eery goernment by woman is bound
to be, and a host of intrlgnes was set
set in motion to get an initation
Very often persons of rank who had
the entree anywhere were excluded
froir the club Such as were admitted
had to dress in conformity, with the
edict of the tyrants, no gentleman be
ing allowed to appear at the assemblies
except In Unee breeches, white craat
and crush hat On one occasion the
uke of Wellington was about to
ascend the stairs to the ballroom
dressed In black trousers when the
guardian of the establishment stepped
forward and said, "Your grace cannot
be admitted in trousers," whereupon

A Pun That Failed
At a public dinner a careless waiter
stumbled when bringing In a boiled
tongue The tongue slipped oer the
edge of the dish Upon the tablecloth
"Neer mind," said the chairman
cheerfully, "it's only a lapsus linguae"
(slip of the tongue)
The joke was receied with a burst
of laughter A gentleman present,
who had no knowledge of Latin, yet
saw what boisterous merriment It
caused, secretly determined that he
would repeat the whole performance
at his next little dinner party at home
and gie his guests a great laugh at his
wit ' 
The occasion arried There was to
be a leg of mutton, and the host bad
instructed the waiter to let it fall when
coming In • The waiter did so, to the
great dismay of the guests
, "Oh, neer mind," " cried  the host
cheerfully, "It's only a lapsus linguae"

it, and now be Is suspicious that some
thing must hae gone wrong some

Appenled to the Powers
The late Joseph Medill, editor of the
Chicago Tribune, besides being an In
defatigable editor, had a decided ein
of humor In his composition
uring the last years of his life, as
his strength permitted, he watched
oer his paper as zealously as in his
younger days, and it was his custom to
scan the columns of certain faorite
exchanges and clip from them ex
tensiely, marking them on the mar
gins, "J M — Must," meaning that the
extracts must go in It was one of hia
great griefs that there was not always
room for all of them, een when col
umns of lie editorial matter had been
crowded out, as they were sometimes,
to make room for them
One night he went up to the room of
the night editor with a bundle of clip
pings In bis hand

The whites of raw eggs are ery
nourishing A good way to prepare the
drink, according to one who knows Is
to break the white Into a jar with
what milk is desired and shake the two
thoroughly together A pinch of salt
should be added An English special
ist recommends to adult patients suf
fering from anrcinic condition the daily
consumption of eight or ten egg whites
They can be taken clear and with ease
if the ''eggs are kept ery co! 3, broken
Into a cold glass and used at once
Another excellent drink is made by
beating the white of an egg to a froth
and adding a tablespoonfuf of rich
cream and a spoonful of brandy This

RELIGION OF THE BLANKET
How the Nnnjo Squaw Prays as Site
Spins and 'Weaes
It is a religion to make a Naajo
blanket Through the kinky, bristling
twine of the warp are woen the hopes
and aspirations of an immortal soul
In the warm colors are expressed the
ardors of passionate hearts, 'the sand
storms they hae faced, the cloudbursts
uuder which then backs hae bent, the
smiling sunshine that has dried their
ftool ; all the aderse and the good for
tunes that hae befallen are wrought
into the Intricate designs The squaw
prays as she pushes the wool card, and
she prays as she twirls the distaff in
her band or rolls It on her thigh; she
prays as she arranges the bealds; sbe
prays as she lustily pounds down the
woof strands with her scrub oak bat
ten
A blanket Is all a prayer, a human
document, a biography bright with the
joy tints of canary yellow, dark with
the olie green of pain One is drawn
to it because one's heart Is moed by
its ineffable, inti^gible humanness
One is strangely moed to both laugh
ter and tears by its exquisitely ariant
colors, each expressing an emotion by
its warmth of blended fibers, eacb
throbbing to a note of triumph or of
woe— Southern Workman;
His Compromise
Mr Potter was giing his son a few
words of fatherly counsel as to his
treatment of his young wife "Now,
when you hae any little differences
of opinion," said Mr Potter In bis most
judicial manner, "if yon can't per
suade Margaret that yon are in the
right, you must compromise, my boy —
compromise with a good' grace"
"I'll try to," said the son respect
fully
"I well remember a little experience
I had with your mother the summer
after we were married," continued
Mr Potter "I wanted to spend six
weeks at Saratoga, and your mother
preferred to spend the time in taking
a trip through Canada It's thirty odd
years ago, but I well remember the
arguments we had before I compro
mised"
"How did you do it? 1 asked the son
"We spent fie weeks and a half In
Canada," 6aid Mr Potter, "and from
Friday night till Monday morning Is
Saratoga"
No Need to Adjonrn,
The legislature of a certain state wae
tardy in adjourning one session, al
though there seemed to be no Impor
tant business under consideration
Judge Jones, one of the legislators,
was met by a friend in the street one
hot morning, and the two stopped to
talk under the shade of an awning
"Goin 1 to clear out pretty soon,

"I suppose so," answered the states
man, mopping his brow
"Anything much goin 1 on down at
the capitol?"
"No"
"Why don't they wind up, then?"
"Well, that" s just the troublePersonal There's
nothing but a lot of petty business to
bother us, and we don't mind that I
Wish something important would come
up, and then the motion to adjourn
would be In order" 
English In England
"Yon must learn the shop language
before you can go  shopping in Eng
land," says a girl who has just re
turned from tbere and has many sto
ries to tell of the difficulties met in the
shops "Shoes are not shoes unless
they are slippers, all boots are high, and
you can't to sae your life get a spool
of thread because there is no such
thing— only a reel of cotton If you
wish cotton, sheeting for Instance, you
ask for calico, and the tape needle to

that he and his marauding companions
