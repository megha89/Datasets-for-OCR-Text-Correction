W M Penry, nowihsanding his published saemen

been all along he proprieor of he mador ispach There
has been no change of ownership The firs issue and he
las since he incorporaion of Jackson shows he same
ownership W M Penry jr is posed in he ispach
columns as he edior, which by no means carries he idea
of proprieorship, and as a maer of fac is no used in any
such sense in his case
Now here is he law goerning conracs and furnishing

ny wilful iolaion of he proisions of his secion

parenal concern influenced him in dodging he quesion If
he ruh mus be old, he was more anxious han he res of

o use he legal phase of his own adopion, he owner of he

The fac is he refusal o oe is in iself a dead gie away
He was conscious ha he was he mos ineresed pary — no

one down he affair o some exen by wiggling ou of he

hounty and municipal officers will here
after be by direct vote of the people. It will be a far more
expensive plan than the one it supplants, both to the counties,
who will have to foot the bills for the primary election as
they now do for the general election, and also to the candi-*
dates, who will practically have to make two canvasses, one
to secure a party nomination, and thereafter a general can
vass to secure election.
We do not believe the system will prove a panacea for all
our political ill; but it is worth trying, and will perhaps
break down the power of the bosses.
The committee of congress working on the revision of the
tariff, propose sweeping reductions on lumber, hides, wood
pulp, leather manufactured goods, etc. The proposed re
vision on the down grade is having a depressing effect upon
the commercial and industrial interests generally. The
special session promises to be a long and lively one. But
the republicans are determined to retain the protective fea
ture of the tariff, and that idea will be uppeimost in every
change proposed. With that policy adhered to little harm
can result to the home industries.
