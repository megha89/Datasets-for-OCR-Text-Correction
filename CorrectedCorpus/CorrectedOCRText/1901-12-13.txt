Borrowing Habits of Poets
Personal On Tennyson's habit of failing to
recognize clearly his own borrowings
from the classical poets, Mr Lang ob
seres that the poets hae always had
a kind of ' regal Indifference to their
own lighter productions Mr Laug
saysPersonal "Scott did not care; no, not when
be found that he had unwittingly taken
a line from a poem by the alet of a
friend In the preface to a little col
lection of erses from the noels he
frankly declares that be cannot pretend
to bo certain which are of his own com
position and which are not
j "To take an example from the leel
at the foot of Parnassus, I once redd,
in an American paper, some lines at
tributed to Mr Austin Dobson 'Not
bad for Dobson,' I said freely to a
friend But it was proed on me that
the rhymes were my own! A bard who
forgets his own erses may be par
doned for remembering those of other
people and mistaking a half line of
somebody else's for his own  I dare
say that Tennyson did this occasion
ally, but he could hardly say that 'the
sun sets' without being accused of un
conscious borrowing"
George's Father
Augustine Washington, the father of
George Washington, was engaged in
1732 in making pig iron at Accokeek
furnace, in Stafford county, Va, about
fifteen miles from Fredericksburg,
when his famous son was born This
furnace had been built by the Princl
pio company, composed of English cap
italists, as early as 1726, on land owned
by Augustine Washington, aggregating
about 1,600 acres and containing Iron
ore, Mr Washington becoming the
owner of one-sixth of the furnace prop
erty in consideration of the transfer of
his land to the company

ANCIENT UMBRELLAS
THEY FIGURED IN CHURCHES JN THE
 EARLY CHRISTIAN DAYS 
When First Adopted by the Pnbllc,
1 They Seem to Hae Been Utilised
Solely; cs Snn Protectors— Once an
Attribute ol Dignity
In the early Christian churches a
large umbrella usually hung oer the
priest, and -it• is said that from this
custom it became one of the attributes
of cardinals appointed from basllican
churches For  years  the doges of
Venice carried umbrellas of state, and
in 12SS Pope Alexander 111 declared
that these should be surmounted by
golden statuettes of the annunciation
Personal Michael Moroslni was the first Vene
tian layman to carry an umbrella,
which consisted of a small; flat square
of green stuff, oer which was a cop
per spiral Soon after the umbrella
was adopted by -fashionable Venetian
dames According to Coryat's "Crudi
ties" (1C11), the Italian umbrella was
a small canopy and was made of leath
er extended by a series of wooden
hoops He says umbrellas were used
by horsemen, who, resting the handles
on the thigh as they rode, bore them'
so that they should "minister shadow
unto them for shelter against the
scorching sun"
In the Hiirleian manuscripts, now in
the British museum, there Is In manu
script  No GO3 a crude illustration
showing the figure of a yoeman hold
ing an umbrella oer his lord, which
leads me to infer that umbrellas were
known In England een In the early
Anglo-Saxon period
Beck, as quoted in the Draper's Dic
tionary, asserts that at the time that
Stephen usurped the crown of England
(twelfth century) umbrellas were in
common use among the English The
first mention of the umbrella In Eng
lish literature is in Florio's "World of
Wonders" (1598), where It is described
as a "kind of round fan dr shadowing
that they use to ride with In summer
In Italy; a little shade"
In 1C56 an umbrella was exhibited in
tbe "Museum Tradescantlanum; or,
Collection of Rarities Presered at
South Lambeth, Near London, by John
Tradescant," which was known as
"one of the wonders of the ark"
In the church of Cartmell, In Lanca
shire, England, there was presered
until a few years ago an umbrella said
to be oer 300 years- old, which was
used chiefly to protect the host
References to the umbrella are to be
found also in Blouut's "Glossographla"
(1C74) and Phillips' "New Worlde of
Words" (ICVS) In the first the refer
ence readsPersonal "Unibrello, a fashion of
round and broad fans) wherewith the
Indians (and from them our great ones)
presere themseles from tbe heat of
the sun,- aud hence any little shadow,
fan or other thing wherewith the wom
en guard their faces from the sun"
The second runsPersonal "Umbrello, a screen
against the sun's beat, used chiefly by
the Spaniards, among whom it Is known
by tbe name quitasole"
The imaginatie Dean Swift In the
"Tale of a Tub" (1C0C) depicts Jack, an
eer resourceful type, making use of a
parchment copy of his father's will as
a nightcap when he went to bed and as
an umbrella in rainy weather Did
the worthy Hanway take his cue from
this or from Kersey, according to whom
the umbrella was a "broad fan or
screen commonly used by women to
shelter them from rain?" The last ref
erence, made In 1709, Is the first men
tion of it as a protector from the rain
Later Bailey, who in his dictionary
(1737) called it a parasol,' defined it as
"a sort of small canopy to keep off the
rain"  
Small, light umbrellas came into
fashion among the ladles of the French
court In 1675, and these were carried
by attendants Richelet tells us that
they were made of oilcloth or leather
and had ribs of whalebone A century
later they found faor with the men,
who carried red umbrellas, with edges
fringed with gold lace
The precise date when Jonas Han
way, who died in 1786, introduced the
umbrella Into England Is not recorded
in any of the encyclopedias I hae at
hand, but they all state that he wag
popularly known as Its Introducer
With the Dutch, as with the Indian
grandees, the umbrella was first an at
tribute of dignity, and well it might
be, for the prices paid for them at The
Hague in 1600 ranged from $75 to $120
each The Dutch colonists who settled
at the Cape of Good Hope were not
slow to insist on presering the dignity
of the umbrella, for Ryk an Tulbagh,
goernor of Oape Colony in 1712 en
acted that "No one less in rank than
a junior merchant or those among the
citizens of equal rank, and the wies
and daughters only of those who are or
hae been members of any council
shall enture to use umbrellas, and
those who are less In rank than mer
chants shall not enter the castle l fine
weather with an open umbrella"—

tingent and Sorrow to Herself
"Do you change the position of the
furniture when you clean a room?"
Inquired housewife No 1 of a friend in
the course of a heart to heart talk
"Do I? Why, yes, indeed! I don't
feel as If the room Is cleaned unless I
change the furniture a little bit Do
you?"
"Well, I usually change the orna
ments around nnd so forth, but in the
spring and fall I like to change eery
thing In a room— completely alter the
whole appearance of It Then I fancy
the things are all new, and they seem
to look prettier somehow But, do you
know, my husband doesn't like It at
all!"
"Neither does mine! Isn't that singu
lar? Men are so peculiar!"
"Yes, iudced they are!"
- So many housekeepers share the
iews of these two that a story with
a moral will not be out of place
It was the other night only that Mr
Blank went unsuspiciously up stairs to
bed at an unusually early hour, leaing
his wife reading In the sitting room
He had a headache and carried a gob
let of water In bis right hand Fear
lessly adancing into the dark bed
room Mr Blank suddenly felt both legs
iolently cut from under him He
clutched wildly at the air and -said
seeral tilings of an exclamatory na
ture, but there was nothing to sae
him He went down
"Good gracious, Henry!" ejaculated
Mrs Blank, hurrying to tbe scene of
disaster "What is j tbe matter?
Where are you? Why don't you light
the gas?" Suiting the action to the
word, she beheld her husband sprawl-
Ing across the bed; the glass he bad
carried had discharged Its contents
across the pillowshams and shiered on
the floor'
Personal Mr Blank did the talking for the
next ten minutes He said that of nil
the blankety blank folly of which the
mind could conceie this of changing
furniture around was the worst He
said it was a pretty thing for a man to
walk Into his' own room and hae to
fall oer thugs In the dark He said
he wouldu stand It; the "furniture
must be replaced where it formerly
stood
"1 shan't do anything of the kind,"
replied Mrs Blank "It looks ery
much nicer where It is Why don't
you feel where you are going when you
get into a dark room?"
"S'pose you'd like me to crnwl In on
all fours!" snarled Mr Blank "I
couldn't feel where the bed was unless
I happened to touch the footboard I
thought I could walk clear oer to the
bureau 1 tell you It's a confounded
crank yon hae on this subject Some
day you'll precipitate "a "serious acci
dent"
"If any one precipitates, it'll be you,
I should think," retorted Mrs Blank
icily And the furniture remained
where it was
It was the next eening that Master
Blank undertook to carry a pile of
schoolbooks from the dining room to
the sitting room He had a bottle of
ink in his hand, and he thought he
knew exactly where the center table
was In the course of his peregrina
tions in search of It, howeer, he came
into loieut collision with tho glass
door of the bookcase, which he broke
There were also inky traces discernible
on the carpet when Mrs Blank came
in This time there was some balm for
her feelings She could spank Master
Blank and did it with tbe best will in
the world
Her own downfall was not long In
coming, howeer, although for 1 a few
days only minor inconeniences were
met with, such as the abrasion of an
kles against chair rockers and slight
bruises receied by means of sudden
contact with unforeseen obstacles Last
eening Mrs Blank undertook to trans
fer the cage of her pet parrot from the
window where It spends the day to tbe
snug corner where It passes the night
She did not trouble to light the gas, and
by some unaccountable mental lapse
she had forgotten the precise point at
which a tabouret, on which stood a Jar
diniere, was stationed She charged
into the tabouret with considerable
force, was oerbalanced by tbe weight
of the cage in her arms and took a
header with a resounding crash The
parrot shrieked, and, unable to distin
guish friend from foe, inflicted a seere
bite on her mistress* finger Mr Blank
came In hurriedly, picked up his wife
and assisted in making an Inentory of
sundry contusions Then they lifted
the parrot cage, badly bent, and tbe
jardiniere with a piece chipped out of
It and the tabouret somewhat scratch
ed, and then Mr Blank obsered quiet

"I hae just one thing to ask you,
Mrs Blank Was I right?"
"No, you were not!" retorted Mrs
Blank saagely "Serious accident?
What's serious about this, I should like
to know? For goodness' sake, Henry,
don't stand there trying to look like a

ture moed back, I'll moe It!" And

AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY
A Series of Order* That Rejuenated
the Ailing Slaes
A correspondent sends the following
story of an old Virginia gentlemanPersonal
Some years before the war a gentle
man of large landed Interests counted
among his possessions a plantation on
the James rier, an estate of consider
able dimensions Other Interests kept
him away from the old place for some
years, during which time there was a
marked decrease In the reenue Upon
his return to the plantation he disco
ered that many of the slaes were laid
up with "rheumatism and other miser
ies, the farming implements were in
bad order and the old homestead was
fast going to rack and ruin Calling
his oerseer he saidPersonal
I "Anderson, I notice a great many old
wagons, plows and harrows about
the place Hae them brought and
piled In front of the house, and on
Monday next order all the niggers on
the place to be present"
At the appointed time they came
The pile was set on fire and the Imple
ments destroyed The following week
he called the oerseer's attention to the
sick and infirm horses, hogs and cattle
and gae the same order When the
negroes had assembled all the animals
were knocked in the head The Fri
day following the landlord again called
his oerseer
"Anderson, I see a great many sick
niggers around here— many who seem
to be laid up with rheumatism and are
good for nothing Gie orders that on
Monday morning nt 10 o'clock they all
appear in the front yard"
The effect on the slaes was magical
On Saturday men who had been un
able to walk were skipping around like
children; the sick grew well suddenly,
and from that time on the plantation
was most prosperous — Exchange

FOOD OF AMERICANS
An English Woman Tells of the
Strange Things She Ate Here
An English woman who isited Amer
ica a short time ago'has been telling
her country women about the "strange
food across the water" Of course she
discoered green corn, but she had been
prepared for that Oyster crabs were
quite new to her
'•They look like-Boston baked beans,"
she explains, "but they taste much bet
ter"
An oyster cocktail filled her with awe
and enthusiasm She tried it at Del
monico's and thought it was soup Of
course In England one didn't sere
soup in a glass; but, then, neither did
the English sere boiled eggs in a
glass One could neer be sure of
Americans
Of canasback duck she has  poor
opinion, but thinks she might like it
better if Americans would hae it cook
ed or een warmed As for terrapin,
she sings Its praise She found It much
like calf's bead, and she always liked
calf s head Shades of Maryland gour
mets, what a slur is there!
"All the puddings in America are pie
or Ice cream," she says, but It must be
understood that pie does not mean
game pie The Yankee pie is a tart
and is übiquitous, she explains
She sat next to an American man
who ate a lump of cheese with his
strawberry pie and turned a plateful of
ice cream oer both, but she doesn't
know that that is a general custom
The oysters were good, buUhad most
impossible names, and the cockles
(meaning clams) are excellent On the
whole, Yankee food and cooking are
good, but there Is too much of the food

the Yukon to Circle City, and the
other two to go by rail to Seattle, and
from tfiero, ia' Skagaway, Dawson,
down the Yukon I was chosen to ac
company the freight and take the
longer routo, ia Nome So after a
stormy oyage of six days, arried
in Seattle on the 6th day of June, 1901
On going ashore, I did not walk half a
block before I met my Jackson friend,
SPersonal Pauloy, also on his way to Circle
City, but delayed there on account of
his hydraulic outfit not haing arried
from San Francisco Wo spent a
pleasant eening together Next
morning I met my partners, French
Pete and Charley Mackie They ha
ing arried the day before my arrial
The steamer St Paul, of which I was
a passongor had to call at Seattle for
passengers and freight, I was astonish
ed at tho business actiity in Seattle
For its size, it almost beats San Fran
cisco, and some things are cheaper than
in B'risco We left Seattle at noon;
Pauley and my partners were at the
wharf to bid me adieu
On the 16th of June we arried at
Unalaska to take a supply of coal, and
the 24th of June found us anchored
within one mile and a half of Nome
We arried at 6 o'clock in the eening,
but most of the passengers were not
landed until the next day Shortly
after our arrial I sat down to write
letters, which I intended to mail in
Nome the next day When I had fin
ished writing I looked at nay watch; it
was a few minutes after one o'clock in
the morning, and I was writing all the
time without any light, as it is day
light for weeks about that time of the
year As I left the smoking room,
whore I was writing, a surpriso awaited
me In the shapo of a sunrise In all
my life I neer saw such a beautiful
sunrise as that just coming up behind
tho mountains of Nome Tho sky was
a mass of burning gold, horo and there
shaded with brilliant colors I forgo!)
letters and eerything, and just stopped
there for 10 or 15 minutes And this
was about tho only attractie and beau
tiful thing I'o seen in Nome I made
up my mind to hae a good look at the
town after breakfast At 9 o'clock I
stepped ashore in Nome, and found the
streets crowded with people and coer
ed with deep mud Weather was cold
and windy, and about noon a drizzling
rain came, which made it een more
disagreeable Apparently eerybody
was busy, as they were rushing by each
other in a hurry Gambling houses
and saloons were also doing a little
business, but I could see only a little
mining, and that I found as I was
walking along the beacK
 About a mile apart were two men
with rockers and one group of three
men with one rocker, which was stand
ing in a holo about 10 feet deep, where
some water had gathered At the
rocker stood an elderly gentleman with
pleasant and friendly manners His
two partners were about 15 or 20 feet
away, shoeling some fine sandy graol
into two buckets, which they carried
to the rocker when filled The rocker
had amalgam plates, and as I could
see no ri files nor canass I asked him
how he managed to sae his coarse
gold, and he said there was none
What little there is left in the beach
sand is as fine as flour 1 asked him
how it paid "Well!" he said, "yes
terday we made $10 between the three
of us" I thought to myself, there are
better diggings In Amador county  I
went back to the crowded streets again,
trying to find somebody from Amador
county, probably Dan Murphy or Geo
Poggi, but Nome Is big and I did not
succeed in finding anybody I was told
that they expected the ground to thaw
out in two weeks, when eerybody
would rush to the creeks, but it was
longer than two weeks before It thawed
out, as It was freezing In Nomo on the
fourth of July \ \''"
And what a barren country around
Nome; not a tree in sight, not oen
enough wood to cook a meal on the
trails The good ground is all staked
within 250 miles of Nome, and If a now
comer really would find anything
worth haing, he'd be swindled
out of it, as so many hae been To
wards eening I went aboard the St
Paul again, glad to get away from
Nome Een business is oerdone in
all Its branches
We sailed the next morning, accom
panied by a strong and cold wind, and
rain Although it is only 18 hours
trael from Nome to St Michaels, we
were not landed there until the sth of
July, haing ran across a lot of float
ing ice, and within 5 miles of St
Michaels eerything was frozen solid
St Michaels is an island under U S
military rule, and the only business
places there are the steamphip com
pany's whares, warehouses, stores,
and hotels The military barracks are
put up neat and comfortable During
my stay In St Michaels I met Dr and
Mrs Hatch, and we had quite a long
chat about Jackson The doctor was
attired in army surgeon's uniform
There was also a sad accident jlu ring
my stay there [On the trip from San
Francisco I goj acquainted with -a
party of six men!; 011 their way to Nor
ton  Sound, sixty miles from St
Michaels, amongst whom was a young
man, Hershel Elder, from Vlsalia, Cal,
a ery pleasant fellow of 25 years
The only fault he had was that be
gambled once in a while on the steamer
Ten Cents Per Copy
St Paul We all had uTwait in St
Michaels ior our freight to be unload
ed, and these prospectors put up their
tents withinji mile from the town On
Monday, the Bth of July, whenjEldeTs
partner (a Mr Hitchcock", also from
Visulia) returned to the tent in the
eening, ho found Horshel Elder on the
ground with a bullet hole in his head,
and dead Whother it was suicide or
accident no one could tell He left a
mother in Vhalia, who thought more
of that boy of hers than of her life
His partner, Hitchcock, wont to the
military authorities to hae him buried,
but they would hae nothing to do
with it as he was no soldier Finally,
after much running around, he got
permission from the deputy marshal to
dig a grae in the burying ground, so
Hitchcock told us about it, and four of
us borrowed picks and shoels from
tho Alaska C Co, and went the fol
lowing "afternoon to dig the grae
We dug in a solid mass of frozen
ground and ice, four feet It took four
of us all afternoon In the eening
at 8 o'clock, a small party of about
twele of us assembled, and we carried
the poor follow to his cold resting place
An elderly gentleman by the name of
Cone, also from Visalia, held a short
but impressie serice, and as we stood
there, with our hats in hand, saying a
short prayer, I thought, that was one
of tho saddest funerals I'e eer at
tended On our way we picked up a
post 12x12, painted white This we
put at the head of the grae, and I
printed with an indelible pencil,
"Hershel S Elder of Visalia, Cal, died,
July 8, 1901, aged 25" I heard since
that his remains will be taken to
Visalia this fall
St Michaels was another place I
was glad to get away from Eery
thing is ery dear Hotels charge $4
per day; coffee and doughnuts, 50
cents, etc So just as soon as they put
my freight on board of the "Susie"
(it cost a lot of urging) I took my ticket
for Circle City, and left St Michaels
on the 11th "of July
The trip up tho Yukon was ery
pleasant, and the scenery is beautiful
The further up the rier we went, the
warmer the weather got
I was landed in Circle City, freight
and all, on the 22d of July,' where my
partners had boon waiting for me
nearly a month This is a typical
northern mining town, and the~*build
ings'are all built of logs Wagon
roads, we hae none, and the trails are
all wet and swampy in summer, and
mosquitoes as thick as the dust in July
on tbe lone road Traeling and haul
ing proisions are better in winter,
when the s tramps and eerything is
frozen solid We had the  first snow
fall on tho Ist of October, and it gets
quite cold now
On tho 12th of September the steam
er "Susie" arried on one of her trips
from St Michael, and whom should I
see on her but George Poggi, on his
way from Nome to Dawson He look
ed well, and as happy as a lark He
said that his next trip will be to South
Africa
We wont out on a week's trip int
the country to look at a place where
wo intond to sink to bedrock this
winter We packed about 35 lbs each
on our backs, slept out in the open,
and did our own cooking all the way
I found the trails ery hard to get
oer, and we did an awful lot of pre
spiring When we came home I found
my pants about throe sizes too large
around the waist ' On our trip we shot
17 ducks, two grouse, two tree squirrels,
and caught about two dozen -big trout
This was in the early part of Septem
ber, and still in the mornings when we
woke up we found quite heay frost on
our blankets
To tell the truth, since I hae been
here seeral times I hae been real
homesick after my little Jackson candy
factory This lifo i 3 rougher than
what I thought it was, but then I am
here now, and will try my hardest "to
stick it out the three years, and when
I leae here and after landing in Frisco,
my first trip will be to Jackson, where
I hope I will find my many good friends
in tbe best of health Will make tha
old lone stage stop in front of the
Sanguinetti building Meanwhile I
wish all Jackson a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year
My partner, Peter Zellor, and also S
Panley wish to be remembered to their
Amador county friends; and I remain,
Yours truly,

FRIDAY DECEMBER 13, 1901
A CURIOUS PROPOSITION
Some of our democratic exchanges
are making a despairing effort to
show that the republican "party is
eering round to the principles of
the democracy in r<\ j ird to the tariff
Because some republicans, in iew
of the surplus reenue, and the uni
ersal prosperity of trade condi
tions, faor a readjustment of the
tariff, therefore they argue there is
practically little difference between
this proposed reision and the demo
cratic doctrine of a "tariff for re
enue only, with incidental protec
tion " Democratic editors are chary
about enlarging upon this pet phrase
and telling in plain language what
is meant thereby Any duty, no
I matter how small, leied upon im
ported manufactured articles, is to
the extent of that duty a protection
to the home manufacturer in the
same line of goods The protection
is an incident of, and inseparable
from the tariff If wages were as
low, and other costs of production
the same, as in the country from
which the dutiable articles are ship
ped, the freight charges and the
duty, howeer snail, would consti
tute a sufficient margin for the suc
cessful competition of the American
manufacturer To proide reenue,
howeer, is the only justification for
a tariff, according to democratic no
itions A' horizontal tariff, so much
per cent of the alue of the articles
imported, is their simplest and most
ideal method of a tariff system, re
gardless of whether the incoming
goods become a disturbing factor in
home industries or not Under this
system', as importations increased,
the lower the tariff was -reduced,
because the reenue from this source
would correspondingly increase with
the growth of the imports So the
competition between the foreign and
home made products would grow
keener, to the disadantage of do
mestic manufacturers and the dis
tress of American labor Thus a
tariff for reenue with incidental
protection, means no protection at
all It has been tried repeatedly,
and tried long enough to thoroughly
test its inapplicability to the indus
trial conditions in this country It
has always resulted in business ca
lamity, making capitalists shrink
from inestment owing to lack of
confidence  A  depleted treasury
has eer been the result, as ast
sums were annually drien out of
circulation i payment for foreign
made articles True, the importa
tions under this system neer reach
ed the proportions that might be ex
pected, as compared with importa
tions under a strictly protectie
tariff, because the working classes
being distressed from scarcity of
employment, were without the means
 to buy, and were compelled to forgo
many things within their reach in
mofe prosperous circumstances
Incidental protection with a tariff
for reenue only is a democratic
phrase designed to tickle the ears of
the laboring masses with the idea of
cheap liing In practice, howeer,
it depletes the pockets of the toilers,
and leaes them stranded in a land
of plenty as the penalty of bad
On the other hand* the republican
policy is to discriminate in tariff
duties; placing, heay imposts on
articles that are or can be made
here, and light duties on such as
cannot be produced here Under
this system the trade of the country
has grown enormously, until it now
ranks first among the nations Not
only bur domestic consumption, but
our foreign commerce has deeloped
amazingly, competing at the present
time in the markets of free trade
Great Britain It may be asked,
how is it that a tariff intended to
keep out importations from the
poorly paid labor countries, enables
the United States to compete in
many lines with those ery countries
on their own ground This is not
such a formidable question as it ap
pears, but it would take too much
space to answer it at this time We
resere it for a future occasion
The painted hands -upon the paint
ed wooden clocks imd watches used
as jewelers' signs throughout the
United States with few exceptions
point to 8Personal18 o'clock It is not gen
erally known that this is the hour
that President Lincoln was assassi
nated and that this almost uniersal
custom of painting clocks is in com
memoration of the life and death of
the martyred president A moe
ment is now on foot by the Jewelers'
Association of the United States to
hae this changed to the hour and
minute when President McKinley
receied the assassin's, bullet, name

Grand Jury  Seport
To the Hon R C Rust, judge of the
superior court of Amador county, Cal
We," the grand jury of Amador coun
ty, impanelled on the 6th day of Decom
bor, beg leae to submit the following
reportPersonal
Tho iirst thing wo did was to iuquire
from tho district attorney of any crimi
nal cases for tho grand jury to 'inesti
gate, but found that all were properly
attended
We counted tho money in tho treas
ury, tho same being $0984090, which
amount corresponds with the report of
the county auditor
We hae examined as close as pos
sible in such short tirao, the books in
both the clerk's ami recorder's office,
also tho sheriff's office, and found them
to be kept in tho most neat and busi
ness-like manner, and all correct
We found the county hospital kept
i a most creditable condition The
patients are fifty-eight, and all aro sat
isfied of the treatment of tho present
manager
Wo also isited tho county jail, and
found it as clean as tho place can bo
kept, and_ beliee that the sanitary
condition is ery good; there are at
present eleen prisoners
We isited the basement used for
the purpose of keeping trial juries at
night, and found it entirely inadequate
for the purpose intended
In regard to the proper protection
and preseration of the county build
ings, which is ono of the important
duties of the superisors, wo urge upon
that body the imperatie necessity of
haing • tho  court house and hall of
records painted on tho outside, as a
moans of protecting the aluable prop
erty from further damage by'the'ele
ments -;t!
The concrete walks and grass plots
that hae been constructed in front of
tho court house and hall of •records,
under the directions of our sheriff, are
both a benefit and ornament to 'the
buildings, secured at a ery small cost
In conclusion, we gie our most sin
cero thanks to the different county of
ficers for their kindness in giing us
cheerfully, all the information wo ueod
ed in the transaction of our business

Italian Immigrants
Twenty-four Italians, direct from
Italy, arried in Drytown last Satur
day night They were domiciled at the

quarters with an Italian family in the

able bodied young men There were
three or four women and a like number
of children None of them was able to
speak a word of English  They come
as bona fide settlers, intending to make
a new home for themseles They are
laboring men, and a number of them
hae already scattered to arious parts
of the county seeking employment
We understand that ten more of these
immigrants were expected to reach
Drytown on Monday night Areport
is current that these arrials constitute

about a thousand destined for this sec

A TYPICAL CASE
How a Drunk and His Honey Farted Com
pany—The Story as Deeloped in the Trial
of Eugene McPherson
The case of the people agaiiisl Eugene
McPhorson was commenced in the su
perior court last Wedtiefilay morning
Defondant was cbargud with stealing
and conerting to bis own use two
checks, the property of oue Joseph
Hawkins The scone of tho light-
Bn gored transaction is ItiM in the pic
turesque illage of Pi no! Groe, and
the story shows that amid the music
of tho pines tho wolji )f human shape
who toil not and still contrie to lie
and dress well, are eer on the alert as
well as in tho crowded citk'>, to pounce
upon the unwary, and reliee him of
his wealth
Hawkins, the ictim of tho plot just
unraeled before a jury, knows no other
way of making a liing than by the
sweat of his broTHE COFFEE HOUSEs besetting weak
ness is a taste for strong waters, and
his taste in this direction lasts so long
as ho has the wherewithal to gratify it
With money in his purse work is not
to be thought 'of After working for
for some time at the Standard Electric
Company's camp at Bear rier — in the
wilderness of pines and away from tho
enticements of ciilization — he wan
dered forth in tho latter part of Octo
ber to mingle once more in the haunts
of business On the 2sth of that month
he struck his old stamping ground of
Pine Groe, his pockets loaded with at
least two company's checks — one for
$5085, the other for $4375— and some
coin He had scarcely resumed his
residence in the pretty hamlet bofore
he became loaded up with something
besides money, unloading his cash at
the same time Ere long he had a
full-fledged jag on— in that line there
is no half-way measures with Hawkins;
it is either 'a dead calm or a cyclone
with him And those who know him
say that when the spirits" are in full
force and effect, ho is= practically ob
liious of passing eents He took the
precaution to speak for a bed at the
hotel Thereafter, the defendant in
ited him, in the spirit of a good
Samaritan of courso, to share bed and
board with him that night, in a cabin
near tho postoffice occupied by him
and one Butternut After supper, so
one of the witnesses for the defense
related, Hawkins strolled into a saloon,
and there bought from a peddler who
was staying there oernight, $3 worth
offish He had partaken of fish for
suppor ,and was so enthused oer his free
bill of fare that ho proposed to barbe
cue the town But this is a side-light
from the main issue Hawkins finally
went to bed with Butternut as a bed
fellow; the defendant occupying the
other bed by himself Ho had his two
checks in a cartridge box in his coat
pocket About 12 o'clock he woke up
somewhat recoered from his booze,
and in his strange surroundings be
thought him of his money He exarn
ed his coat; the box was there, but
the checks wore gone He asked Mc-
Pherson if he had them, and be said,
No Hawkins said he had not indorsed
the checks either with his name or a
cross  V-*
McPherson got up at 4 o'clock next
morning, boarded the stage and came
on to Jackson He presented one check
bearing Hawkins name on the back, at
Coset's saloon, and got it partly cashed
Mr Coset subsequently got wind that
there was something wrong, and got
back his money and returned the papor
McPherson took the other check to H
Weil's, bought a bill of goods and re
ceied $19 in money About this time
constable Kay took a hand in tho
game,  arrested McPherson, and took
both cheeks in tow as eidence; both
papers were now mutilated where the
indorsements had been made
McPherson took the stand in his own
behalf, and in trying to patch up an
ugly case utterly ruined' hisPersonal' cause
He said that Hawkins gae him the
checks, told him to indorse them for
him, and get them cashed in Jackson
At first he denied that Hawkins woke
up in tho night and inquired for his
missing checks Then he weakened,
saying ho was not sure on that point
Finally he admitted, under cross-ex
amination, with the cold sweat stand
ing in beads upon his face, and which
he kept wiping away, at the same time
calling for water— that Hawkins did
ask him if he had his checks, and he
said, "Yes" It was the most dramatic
and abject breakdown of a defendant
upon the witness-stand seen for many
years His attorney, C H Crocker,
was dumbfounded by this unexpected
turn The following jury sat on the
casePersonal S Isamjnger, D T Kerr, R M
Ford, J W Kirk W A Gregory, J
W Loomis, C A Cramer, I N Chit

the sum of $2000, alleged to be duo on
certificate of insurance in the order is
sued to M Murray Matt Murray was
a former sheriff of Amador county In
1889, he borrowed from Isaacs $1200,
giing his insurance in the order as se
curity, the payment of which was
transferred from Mrs Murray •to
Isaacs Both Murray and his wife are
dead, and Isaacs wandered off in an un
sound condition of mind, and Jones
was appointed guardian to look after
his estate The heirs of M Murray,
being unaware of the transfer of the
insurance, applied for the benefits
The order refuses to pay until the
question is decided in the courts as to

The Gotow Case
The trial of Wm Gotow, accused of
grand larceny, committed on or about
the 26th day of July last in stealing
from the Stono Company at one of
their camps at Tabeaud reseroir a lot
of harness, was commenced in the su
perior court on Monday morning
Little difficulty was experienced in se
curing a jury from the regular enire
The following jurors were sworn to try
the casePersonal
O E Martin, Lee Martin, J C
Rador, Thomas Simmons, Walter Dent,
T K Norman, W C Littlefleld, H
N Dickerman, Andrew Winter, J M
Kirk, Jos Noe, W H Blakely
The case presented some peculiar
features Six sacks of harness were
missed from the camp, and hid in the
brush near the road side Gotow and
another employe named Fred Christen
son, were arrested on the 29th of July
and charged with the crime Some
time thereafter Christenson pleaded
guilty, under the impression conceied
by himself that it would be better for
him to do so Gotow, howeer, denied
any criminal participation in the affair,
and resolutely determined to stand
trial Ho- has been confined in the
county jail since the 29th of July, being
unable to furnish bonds Twice the in
formation filed against him on this
charge has been quashed on demurrer,
on technical grounds He was rear
rested immediately after each dismissal,
and the third information was held to
be alid, and upon that the trial was
had Christenson was brought up
from San Quentin as a witness, at the
request of the prosecution, but instead
was used as a witness for the defense
It was brought out that this conict
witness was not interiewed by the at
torney for the defense, Neil Mac
quarrie, prior to his taking the stand;
and also that he was interiewed by
the district attorney on the eening
prior to his taking the stand, and told
what the defendant himself had testi
fied to on that day f His testimony
gien at his own preliminary examina
tion, was utterly inconsistent with that
gien in the Gotow case In tho former
he implicated Gotow as the prime
moer in the crime; in the latter he
seemed to exonerate him The story
as told by the prosecution was that as
Mr Palmer, the book-keeper, was re
turning to the camp late at night, he
oertook Christenson and Gotow on
the roadside They were hauling some
sack3 They told him they had quit
work Tho next morning the harness
was missed, but both men were at work
with their teams as usual Remember
ing the incident of the night before it
naturally suggested itself that the two
men and the sacks were connected with
the missing horse clothing Inesti
gations resulted in Christensoa admit
ting the theft, and he took the officers
to where the six sacks had been con
cealed on the south side of the road
Reaching the spot, they found only
three sacks Gotow reealed where
the other three sacks had been re
moed to the north side of the road
He was the only one who knew the
whereabouts of these sacks Gotow
had a couple of horses and a spring
wagon in the neighborhood of SJab
town He told a somewhat plausible
story that he had boon roped into the
affair innocently He had been asked
by Christenson to help him moe some
sacks, and did so, not knowing what
they contained; but he did know that
his companion had been in state prison
Christenson corroborated his story to
the extent that Gotow did not take the
harness from the barn, and did not
know what the sacks contained The
theory of the prosecution was that the
two men conspired to steal the prop
erty and diide it between That the
three sacks remoed to the north side
of the road constituted Gotow's por
tion, and the three left where originally
concealed were his co-worker's share of
the plunder The jury got the case
about fie o'clock, and in about an hour
arried at a erdict of guilty as charged
He will bo sentenced tomorrow

Learning the Game,
Vhen that great piulnsiuan J B
Hickok, better known as "Wild Bill,"
came east on what he called a "redhdt
trail to learn something,", he stopped
one Saturday uight at a hotel in Port
land, He
When he went to his room to seek
rest, he found that the adjoining room
was occupied by a company of fashion
able and rich young sports of Portland
who, it did not take him long to dis
coer, were playing an Interesting
game of poker for high stakes In ain
did he try to sleep He could not do
so, and after au hour  arose, dressed
himself and knocked on the door
Instantly all was silent; but he in
quired politely that as they would not
let him sleep would they let him come
in and watch the game?
They did so and were impressed with
the appearance of the man and asked
if he would Join them* '' Personal \-'-'Z
"I will if you will post me; but, you
know, ' I'm a tenderfoot east" he re
plied
They were willing to "post" him,
and, playing awkwardly, making blun
ders and asking questions, but seem
ingly greatly interested, he continued
to play until daylight, when he put his
winnings, some $1,500', in his pocket
"I thank you, gentlemen," he said,
"and I'm rather glad you would not let
me sleep I'll be here until tomorrow,
so keep me awake some more"
But the players did not appear again

Greek and Roman Stoes
Warm as Greece and Rone and
Egypt are, stoes were made there In
the dim and misty istas of the past
It was not Just the pattern used at
present, but was a ' metal basin in
which charcoal, was burned It sat In
the middle of the room, and as the re
sulting smoke was of the slightest no
opening in the roof or elsewhere was
necessary The same Implement, still
called by its old Greek name of bra
zier, is now employed in many portions
of continental Europe, where it is util
ized for heating as well as cooking
 But the progressie Romans Im
proed on that and made a hypocaust
It was the germ of the present fur
nace It was made under the house in
a little cellar prepared for it, aud the
heat was conducted to the rooms and
baths through creices left in the floor
and lower portions of the wall Later
flues were proided, conducting heat
to any portion of the house In some
of the old Roman illas in England the
remains of these old time furnaces aro
still found 
The Primary Planets
The primary planets are those which

thus attended carry the satellites or

Happy Thought of a Han In a Plx
An operator for a western railroad
who had sered his company long and
well was called Into the office one day
and asked if he thought he could hold
down the Job of night dispatcher He
promptly replied that he could and was
told to report for duty that night, and
his chief instructed him In what ho
was to do Just after the chief left the
office it began to blow and snow, and
tho trains commenced to run late The
new night dispatcher soon had deelop
ed a bad case of "rattles" and almost
cried He did not want an accident,
and he could not handle the trains  So
a happy thought struck him , As fast
as a report came in he replied, directing
the conductor to take a siding and
wait for orders, and it was not a great
while until he had eery train on the
diision sidetracked Then he took a
book, lighted his pipe and sat down to
wait for daylight In the morning the
chief appeared with anxiety written all
oer- his face
"Any accidents, Johnny?" asked the
chief
"Not an accident I'e got 'em all
on the sidetrack, snowed In and wait
ing for orders, and you will hae to
get 'em out lam going to blow this
job" It took the chief and his force
nearly all day to get the trains straight
ened out and traffic resumed oil the

False Tails For Horses
False tails are extensiely made for
horses, old faorites especially, whose
caudal appendages present a woruout
and moth eathen appearance, like Pe
truchio's "old mothy saddle," and his
prodigiously mothy get up ("Taming of
the Shrew," HI, 2) They are also worn
by funeral horses, and by other horses
of exquisite outline selected for a par
ticular kind of work, but which are
somewhat spoiled in appearance by
the posses *J  ' i rat tall (bald, like a
rat's) These useful appliances, how
eer, are not constructed exclusiely
for harness horses I hae seen rows
of bogus tails, artistically joined on to
the crupper, hanging up in a caalry
barracks ready for instant serice, be
ing slipped on just like a finger stall
The "fine ends" or false tails used
by nobody but "horse copers" or low
swindlers are most ingeniously fastened
on the animal's bare back by inisible
means A dealer in horses neer looks
at a horse with a bad tall, and he al
ways goes to the best market only—

Robins Play at Being Dead
One morning a well known naturalist
was greatly surprised to see a robin
lying on his back eidently dead, being
rapidly pulled round and round by an
other bird of tbo same species
The naturalist at once came to the
conclusion that he had come in time
to witness the end of a deadly en
counter, and that the lie robin was
indulging in the cruel triumph of drag
ging his ictim's lifeless body oer the
stones >-lPersonal;-
But he was mistaken, for suddenly
the lie bird went down upon his back,
his wings and legs were stiffened, and
he gae eery appearance of being
dead, while the other robin who had
been sliamming death hopped on his
legs and proceeded to sere his com
panion in the same way as he bad
done him Finally the two birds flew
away together to a neighboring tree
low the People of Sangtr Keep Time,
The people of Sangir, an island of the
Malay archipelago, keep time by the
aid of an hourglass formed by arrang
ing two bottles neck to neck The sand
runs out in half an hour, when the bot
tles are reersed Close by them a line
is stretched, on which bang twele
sticks marked with notches from one
to twele, with a hooked stick, which
is placed between the hour last struck
and the next one One of these glasses
keeps the time for each illage, for
which purpose the hours are sounded

factorily Explained
Along the shallow bottom of the
ocean, not ery far from the land, a
number of openings hae been disco
ered In arious parts cf the world
through which water as pure and fresh
as that of nny bubbling spring mingles
with the salt water of the sea Anoth
er remarkable class of fresh water
springs Is those that sink out of sight
or perhaps neer come to the surface,
but follow hidden channels under the
land and under the sea until they final
ly come to the open air on an Island
Both of these types of  underground
riers are perhaps most remarkably Il
lustrated near and on Bahrein Island,
In the Persian gulf, a place that is also
noted as one of the chief sources of
pearls

land has almost no rainfall It Is a
dead leel of sandy desert relieed only
by palm groes and patches of egeta
tion where water springs to the sur
face from the mysterious underground
channels In many places the water
does not reach the surface, but 1b found
by sinking wells, the water being rais
ed to tho surface by donkeys and bul
locks and poured Into Personalthe channels
from which the date palms and other
crops are Irrigated, j These springs can
not possibly, be deried from the island,
and It is no more likely that they come
from the sandy wastes of neighboring
Arabia The Arabian shore as far as
can be seen is low and deoid of water
except at El-Katif where similar
springs are found
Arabs say; that these streams come
straight from the Euphrates rier
through an' underground channel by
which the great rier In part, flows be
neath the Persian gulf Geologists,
howeer, hae dismissed this theory
Though the origin of the springs has
not yet been satisfactorily explained,
the most faored theory Is that they
come froni the well watered slopes of
the Persian mountains far to the north
If this theory Is correct,' lt means that
the rainfall sinks into the earth's crust
until It ' reaches impermeable rock
strata along which It Is carried for a
great distance to the south out under
the sea until the rock, sloping upward,
again brings -the- water near the sur
face on Bahrein island Some of the
weils that are thus supplied are enor
mous, and one of them, the Adarl,
seres for the irrigation of many miles
of date palms through a canal of an
cient'construction The Adarl well is
one of the great sights of Bahrein, be
ing a deep basin of water , 22 by 40
yards in size  The fact that It comes
from a far higher source Is shown by
the force with which It enters the welL
Diers, drien back by the strong cur
rent, are unable to reach the bottom
There being no wells within miles of
some of the coast towns of Bahrein,
they obtain water from springs that
issue from the bottom of the gulf not
far from the shore These springs of
course hae the same origin as -the
wells Diers, with goatskins under
their arms, die through the salt water
and fill the skins with the cold, fresh
liquid at the bottom The water ob
tained in this  way usually contains
a slight admixture of salt water, so
that the mixture is Just a little brack
ish At some of these openings at the
sea bottom the head of water entering
the < sea is so strong that when hollow
bamboos are pushed down into it the
water rises through the tubes, delier
ing the fresh water dlrectlj* into es
sels that are held by men and women
who are sitting in the boats that
brought them from the land The
force of some of the streams as they
come from the earth Is so considerable
that It pushes back the salt water, and
the spring Is not mixed with the sea
water for quite a space around the
place of entrance
It has been practically determined
within the past few years that the wa
ters of a small rier In West Africa
which  disappeared in a fresh water
swamp that has no isible outlet find
their way by an underground channel
Into the Atlantic and mingle with the
sea through an opening in the bottom
that has been discoered a few miles
from Cape Verde A channel has been
found on the sea floor which, appar
ently, was cut by some fresh water
stream During some soundings that
were made In 1895 for the purpose of
finding and raising a broken cable the
essel engaged in the work was sur
rounded by swamp egetation that was
continually rising to the surface It
was eidently brought through the un
derground channel from the swamp
- The breaking of a cable off the mouth
of the Rouma rier Jn East Africa
has been attributed to the destructie
action of a strong current of sweet
water entering the sea leel seeral
miles from the land Another remark
able example of a submarine rier Is
found to the north of the city of Arlca
on the Pacific coast of South America
A rier from the Andes that is grad
ually swallowed up in the sand has
been found to make Its way inisibly
Into the sea, with which It unites some
miles from the land— New York Sun

&trlkli}4 a Light With a Popgun
The inhabitants of the countries bor
dering on India hae their own meth
ods or making fire A Burmese mes
senger recently brought a note to an
English official, and the latter obsered
something resembling a boy's popgun
hanging by the messenger's side Cu
riosity prompted him to ask the natie
what it was, and he was surprised to
find that it was a machine for making
lire
The natie exhibited the apparatus
and explained the working, concluding
with a practical demonstration It
was a tube, closed at one end and fitted
with a piston At the end of the piston
was a grooe or caity, smeared with,
wax, which was used for making
thread or Inflammable material adhere
to It The tinder, to keep the old name,
Is pressed on the wax when a light Is
required and is not kept therealways 
Placing the wisp of  cotton on the
wax, the natie Inserted the tightly
fitting piston in the tube, then forced
It along the latter by giing It a sharp
blow On withdrawing the piston the
cotton was found to be alight, haing
been ignited by the concussion with the
compressed air— Pearson's Weekly
Guisot, Thiers and Bismarck
One day I was inited to dinner with
the Count of Enzenberg at the resi
dence of Prince yon Bismarck in Ber
lin  The count, a former charge d'af
faires in Paris, was a great collector
of autographs After a repast the
count exhibited a sheet of paper on
which Guizot and Thiers had affixed
their signatures "It Is ery interest
ing," said Prince yon Bismarck "Al
low me to show this to my wife" (She
was sick in bed at that time) In a
few minutes the chancellor returned,
and, returning the sheet of paper to
the diplomat from Wurttemberg, he
added, "I hope that I did not spoil it
by writing something on It" (
Here follows what was written on
the paperPersonal

to forgie a good deal and forget nothing

Blnnt Judge Morris
On one occasion, in trying an abduc
tion case, Lord Morris, once chief jus
tice of Ireland, addressed the jury as
followsPersonal "I am compelled to direct you
to find a erdict of guilty in this case,
but you will easily- see that I think It
Is a trifling thing, wMch I regard as
quite unfit to occupy my time It Is
more aluable than yours At any rate,
it is much better paid for Find, there
fore, the prisoner guilty of abduction,
which rests, mind ye, on four points—
the father was not aerse, the mother
was not opposed, the girl was willing
and the boy was conaynlent"
The Jury found the prisoner guilty,
and the judge sentenced him to remain
in the dock till the rising of the court
Hardly had he deliered sentence than,
turning to the sheriff, Lord Morris
saidPersonal "Let us go," and, looking at the
prisoner, he called across the court,
"Marry the girl at once, and God blesa
you both"
WoTHE COFFEE HOUSEgh Birds Fly
A Strassburg aeronaut says he has

A Relic of Peter the Great
The cottage where Peter the Great
dwelt when he was learning the trade
of shipbuilding in Zaarndam, Holland,
still exists, though somewhat dilapidat
ed It contains the rude furniture
which the great Peter used— a bed

cased in a building erected for the pur

erected by Alexander of Bussla in 1814
Pacing a Natural Gait
The pacing habit Is common among
animals, says a writer In Scribner's
Magazine Many animals pace— cattle,
for Instance; and, among dogs, setters
I beliee pacing to be a' rather more
natural gait than trotting Trotting,
as it exists In oar fast horses, is scarce
ly a natural gait, but Is rather the re
sult of breeding and education Personal', Personal'Personal
A Night Light
 Some people make It a point neer to
retire without a light burning in the
house A bit of information worth
knowing Is that a small een light may
be obtained from a small piece of can
dle all night If fine powdered  salt is
piled around the candle until the black
part of tho,wick Is reached
Work For It
Nothing that is of real worth can be
achieed without courageous working
Man owes his growth chiefly to that
actie striing of the will, that en
counter with difficulty, which we call
effort; and it Is astonishing to find how
often results apparently impracticable
are thus made possible
Clean as a Whistle
The origin of the saying "as clean
as a whistle" Is ascribed to the "whis
tle tankard" of olden times, in which
the whistle came into play when the
tankard was emptied or "cleared out"
to announce to the waiter that more
liquor was required
Under the mogul emperors extensie
systems of roads were constructed to
India connecting all leading points In
the peninsula
