JOHNSON FOR GOVERNOR
Theodore Bell is accusing bis republican opponen for
goernor, Hiram Johnson, wih sealing his campaign hun
der, because Bell made his canass four years ago on an ani
railroad dominaion issue and animachine conrol of pary
poliics ccording o his claims, while he was caring ou
a record along hese lines, Johnson was scarcely heard of in
his branch of reform Een if his conenion were correc
— which s no — s a ery slim argumen upon which o
base a claim for suppor a he ballobox If boh guberna
orial candidaes are running on prey much he sains pla
form—admiing he urgency of he reforms adocaed— he
ial quesion wih oers is, which candidae, if eleced,
would be mere likely o be able o gie pracical effec o he
reforms needed On his poin, here can be no quesion
ha he republican sandardbearer occupies he anage
ground He is backed by he majoriy pary — he pary
ha has a good record of achieemen in he way of needed
legislaion Bell, on he oher hand, is a candidae wihou
any pary behind him worh speaking of If eleced, he would
be powerless o accomplish anyhing wihin sricly parisan
lines There is no room o doub ha he nex sae legisla
ure will be srongly republican, and a democraic goernor
would be helpless wihou he assisance of he lawmaking
body
Bell is no doub an able man, and sincere in his profes
sions Like many ohers of his poliical creed, he has de
eloped a craing afer office since he arried a oing age
Johnson, on he oher hand, has been ery frugal in his re
spec This is his firs enure in officeseeking, and i may
be ruhfully said ha he is a candidae oday, no for he
loe of poliical prefermen, bu i because he is moed hereo
by sern sense of public duy, and an earnes desire o sere
his sae along welldefined lines Johnson does no suffer
in any paricular by comparison wih his democraic com
peior, Theodore Bell
Englebrigh is no he mos brillian represenaie his
secion has had on he floor of congress; bu he is one of he
hardes workers for he ineress of his disric His demo
craic opponen — Judge Raker of Modoc couny — is rying
o pick flaws in his congressional record I is a ery easy
maer o charge a congressman wih no haing secured all
ha his disric waned in he shape of appropriaions The
same complain migh apply wih equal force o eery disric
in he Unied Saes, for as a rule eery disric wans a good
more of federal aid han i ges, and probably much more
han s jusly eniled o Mr Englebrigh mus be judged
by wha he has done, no by wha he has failed o do side
from paryism, we beliee he disric would be loser by swap
ping Englebrigh for Raker The democraic nominee is
superior judge of Mfdoc couny, and s agains he law of
he sae for one holding ha posiion o run for congress
This migh no be a bar o his being seaed if eleced The
siuaion is enied o serious consideraion by he oers
Why no surrender he judgeship and hereby ge squarely
wihin he legal requiremens Keep each of hese office
holders in he posiion he now occupies will be he beer for
all concerned
Four years ago Bell carried mador couny — wih a nor
mal republican majoriy of fully 200— by 292 majoriy oer
Gille This resul was no owing o any personal prefer
ence for Bell, or prejudice agains he republican candidae
I was simply a proes regisered agains cerain mehods
of pary policy, disaseful o he oers This oucome can
no be aken as a crierion of he coming elecion There is
no reason why Johnson should no carry he solid oe of
his pary, and ha means ha he will carry he couny by a
subsanial majoriy
The absorbing issue before he people of raador couny
is he breakup of he official clique ha has been running
hings wih a high haud This is more imporan han
augh else, jus as he regulaion of one's own household is
of more ial concern hau he affairs of one's neighbor
The superisor body canno be maerially modified a his

Qualified In Eery Re
spec and Highly
Honored
There is always room for an hones
difference of opinion on maers of
public policy, and in he minds of
many hones republicans, here is a
quesion as o he wisdom of incor
poraing in he sae republican pla
form hose adanced ideas, so
called, firs promulgaed by he popu
lis pary of a few years ago Bu,
afer all, s no possible ha all re
publicans or republican newspapers,
reflecing or leading public opinion,
should agree The whole counry
seems o be suffering from a surfei
of poliical ideas, and while we all be
liee in poliical as well as commer
cial and social progress, we canno ac
comodae ourseles o all he isms ad
ocaed wihin wide range of , hough,
beween ulra conseraism on he one
hand and ulra radicalism on he oher
We beliee, howeer, ha mos of i
us can agree on one proposiion, and
ha is, he policy of creaing a non
parisan judiciary The people, as a
whole, are jealous of he repuaion
and sanding of he supreme cour of j
he sae and in heir selecion of can
didaes are prone o ignore poliics ;
bu here ough no o be any conen
ion as o he adisabiliy of reelec
ing Judge M C Slo3s, as associae
jusice of ha eminenly respecable
body of judges, he supreme cour of
California The peculiar finess of
Judg Sloss, by reason of his maure
age, igorous manhood, judicial em
peramen, experience and profound
learning, would seem o be apparen
o all who hae a knowledge of ha
genleman's record Wih he people,
he selecion of a judge is a maer of
personal finess and no of parisan
ship Is he a jus judge? Is his as
sociaion of such a characer ha he
has no become biased? oes he faor
he corporaion or he people's iew
poin? Has he ha judicial mind and
fairness as will enable him, in his de
cisions, o deal jusly as beween he
ineress of labor and of capial? Is
he fearless o render a jus decision
wihou regard o popular and ofen
incompeen criicism? No man, wha
eer his condiion of life may be
should demand or expec more han a
square deal, and he hones elecor
will always cas his oe in faor of
he judge who will ado he square
deal as his policy
In considering he candidacy of
Judge Sloss regarding hese qualifica
ion, we can only judge his fuure re
cord by wha i has been in he pas
Since Judge Sloss has been on he
supreme bench, he has wrien many
decisions, seeral of hem peculiarly
characerisic of his fairness, noably
his decision eniled expare Marin,
rendered in 1909, which was of grea
imporance o miners and smeler
men This decision upheld he con
siuionaliy of he ac limiing he
hours of labor of underground miners
and smelermen, o eigh hours per
day noher decision by Judge Sloss,
of ial ineres o all classes of labor
employed in mills and facories, up
held he alidiy of he employers
liabiliy law These decisions simply
illusrae he fairness ard finess of
Judge Sloss for he posiion he seeks,
and his large pluraliy oe in he
primaries indicaes ha he people

Bell's Foolish Argument
In his appeal to the voters, Mr Bell
repeatedly ha 3 said :
"California cannot enjoy a stable
administration of affairs unless the
man who is elected governor has be
hind him a united party. If 1 am
elected, 1 shall not be obstructed or
disturbed by factional disturbance in
my party."
Since Mr Bell has used this argu
ment several times, undoubtedly its
absurdity does not appeal to him. It
is a poor argument for the election of
Mr Bell, that he would not be dis
turbed by factonal differences, when
the fact is that he would not have be
hind him even a semblance of a party
disturbed or otherwise. TheJCalifornia
legislature is overwhelmingly republi
can. The most potent force in the re
publican party of the state is Hiram
W. Johnson. Within his party, he has
shown his ability to effect reforms
that are in the interest of the whole
people. In carrying out tne pledges
of the republican platform, he will
have the backing of an overwhelming
majority in the legislature elected up
on tin. same platform. There can be
no question of his ability to carry out
the reforms which tiie people demand.
Granting Mr Bell every high pur
pose, the fact that he belongs to the
party of the diminishing minority is
not an argument for his election.
Evsry year a large number of poor
sufferers whose lungs- are sore and
raked with coughs are urged to go to
another climate. But this is costly
and not always sure. There's a better
way. Let Dr. King's New Discovery
cure you at home. "It cured me of
lung trouble.," writes W. R. Nelson,
of Calamine, Ark., "when all else
failed, and 1 gained 47 pounds in
weight.. Its surely .the king of all
coughs and lung cures." Thousands
owe their lives and health to it. Its
positively guaranteed for coughs,
colds, la grippe, asthma, croup — all
throat and lung troubles. 50 cents and
$1. Trial bottle free at Spagnoli's
drug store.
Big Band of Goats
A large band of angora goats passed
through Jackson Wednesday morning,
bound for a ranch near San Andreas,
Calaveras county. There were 2100 in
the flock, .the largest band of these
animals that has been seen in this
sec 1 ion for many years. They , are
owned by Louis Joses, of San Andreas,
who with an assistant, was driving
them to his home place. He left home
about three weeks ago to bring the
goats from Tehama county, where he
had purchased them. He has been on
the road ever since, and expeced to
reach home Thursday. The goats were
in fine condition, they had all been
recently sheared of their crop of wool.
Mr- Joses bought them as a specula
tion, and for raising them to some ex
tent. There is a demand for goat meat
on the part of the Austrian boarding
houses and others. They cure the
meat by smoking, etc, and it is con
sidered equal if not preferable to beef.
The goats will weigh full grown about
100 pounds, and will command from
$2.50 to $3 a head. The hide with
'wool thereon is low in price, worth
: about 35 cents.
It is in time of sudden mishap or ac
cident that Chamberlain's liniment can
be relied upon to take the place of the
family doctor, who cannot- always be
found at the moment. Then it is that
Chamberlain's liniment is never found
wanting. In cases of sprains, cuts,
wounds and bruises, Chamberlain's
liniment takes the soreness and drives
away the pain. Sold by all dealers.
Effect of Tariff Charges.
Not for many years has the price
of cattle, fit for the butchers, been so
high as now. Butchers in this section
have to pay 9 cents per pound on the
hoof. This is the highest rate touched
within the knowledge of those now in
that business. And they are hard to
get even at this fancy price. It is also
ncteworthy, that while the price of
cattle is thus soaring, the price of
hides has declined. Butchers are not
able to get more than 8 cents per
pound for hides whereas a years ago.
the rate was 9 cents. This reduction
is accounted for by the tariff being
tuken on: hides. The imported hides
fix the market rate for the domestic
article. This is one effect of the free
list business— the reduced tariff of the
Payne-Aldrich bill. It is extremely
doubtful, however, whether the con
sumer will reap any benefit whatever
from this reduction. The only ones
benefitedare apt to be the importers of
the foreigh hide.

Large Funeral Cortege
The funeral cortege following the
remains of Vasco Voscovich, who met
a tragic death with his companion.
Earl Liversedge in the South Eureka
mine last Wednesday, by falling over
two thousand feet down the shaft, is
said to be one of the largest that ever
entered Jackson. The procession came
here from Sutter Creek, where the un
fortunate miner resided. Services and
interment were held at the Greek
Catholic church. Every available car
riage in the county was engaged,, and
it is estimated that more than fifty
carriages were in line.

Indistinct Echo
The E«'ho of last week has this to
say about John Daneri, who is running
on the democratic ticket for coroner
and public administrator :
Mr Daneri is a resident of Sutter
Creek, : where he was born and grew to
manhood. He is engaged in the under
taking, business in that thriving town.
He lias, had considerable training in
the office to which he aspires, having
served three years as a deputy under
Geo. M Huberty, in Jackson, so that
he will bring to the office, if elected,
plenty of experience to prevent
blunders.
That the candidate served as deputy
coroner for tnree years in Jackson
under the last administration is cer
tainly news to the people here. There
is no record of such appointment as
deputy.
Reaching the Top
in., any calling of life, demands a
vigorous body and a keen brain.
Without health there is no success.
But Electric Bitters is the ' greatest
health builder the world has ever
known. It compels perfect action of
stomach, liver, kidneys bowels, puri
fies and enriches the blood, tones and
invigorates the whole system and en
ables you to stand the wear and tear
of your daily work. After months of
suffering from kidney trouble." writes
W. M. Snerman, of Cusuhing, Me.,
"three bottles of Electric bitters made
me feel like a new man." 50c. at
Spagnoli's drug store.

New Graft a Success
EL M. Prine,. of West Point, Cala
vcraa county,, believes he has been
successful in his attempt to graft
chestnuts into* Oak trees. As a result
of hiß experiments,, this year for the
first time; the trees seem to be bear
ing, and the nut in tho onk ha* a
doublb burr in it. Although tho burs
are in the embryo,, he is sure that
they will be found to contain chest
nuts* Price's experiments received
considerable attention about a year
ago, when they were given publicity in
The Bee. At that time, it was an
nounced that he- had succeeded in
grafting walnuts into oaks, and; as a
result he was flooded with questioning,
letters from all parts of the country.
What he actually did was to cross
English walnuts with the California
walnut, producing a very large nut of
excellent meat. His experiments with
the chestnut and' oak are made with
the idea of growing-; in this state chest
nuts in sufficient quantities to be a
factor as a foodstuff. The chestnut in
Italy, he- points out,, is very generally/
used a» a food. If his- present experi
ments prove as successful as- he ex
pects,, he plans to have all the
now practically useless, oak trees that
abound in the state growing a chestnut
food supply in the near- future. — Bee.
