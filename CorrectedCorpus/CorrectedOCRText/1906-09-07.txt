THE EMOCfiTIC PLTFOEM
The democraic local plaorm, adop
ed a he conenion held las Saur
day, appears in anoher column We
ask our readers — wheher democras
or republicans— o read i carefully
If hey can make ou anyhing ou
of i, s more han we can I is
he neares approach o saying noh
ing ha we hae sumbled across in a
proclamaion of ha characer in
many moons I was significan ha
no one o he candidaes nominaed
saed ha he endorsed he plaform
Probably hey were in he same dilem
ma as he specaors— hey did no
know wha i mean They did no
care o plan hemseles on a lo of
ho air We canno call i a issue of
gliering generaliies, for here is
no glier abou i I professes o
pledge all is nomiuees o an econom
ical adminisraion of affairs, and a
he same ime endorses and com
mends presen democraic officials in
heir conduc This erbiage, here
fore, if i means anyhing, merely
seeks o perpeuae exising condi
ions, as far as hey are concerned
They are he ne plus ulra of
efficiency This sor of ay will
hardly go wih he oers I can
and will be shown ha we are a long
way from he goal in his regard
Then again he fling abou he assess
or haing his office a he couny
sea open ail he year round during
office hours, insidiously adding, "as
he law conemplaes" Where does
' he law, eiher in express erms or
by implicaion, require he assessor
o do his id he rainers of his
ulra parisan plaform imagine hey
could make a poin in faor of heir
candidae, and agains he presen
republican assessor by such a plank
misleading and unrue The couny
goernmen ac caysPersonal
"The following officers mus reside
a he couny sea of heir respecie
couniesPersonal Couny clerk, audior,
recorder, sheril, disric aorney,
axcollecor, and reasurer ll
couny officers mus hae heir offices
a he couny sea, and he sheriff,
clerk, recorder, audior, reasurer
and disric aorney mus keep heir
offices open for he ransacion jo
business from 9 a m unil £ p m
uon judical days exceped"
The assessor being omied from
his lis, he only inference o be
drawn is flaly conradicory o he
democraic plaform, namely ha he
law does no "conemplae" ha he
assessors shall hae his office open
during office hours a he couny sea
all he year round There is nohing
o be gaiuad by misrepresenaion,
een in a democraic plaform, which
according o radiion is generally
mean o hoodwink he oers
There is nohing o be gained by he
assessor haing his office open as he
plaorm wans I would increase
he cos of goernmen wihou any
corresponding benefi From ugus
o March he assessor has pracically
nohing o do wih axpayers His
books are urned oer o oher
officials Perhaps he democras are
figuring o fasen anoher berh on
an already oer burdened communiy,
in he shape of a depuy assessor "all
he year round" I is a moe in he
direcion of exraagance and sine
cure officers, raher han of economy
and he public welfare
Then again he proposiion of each
couny being allowed a represenaie
of is own in he sae legislaure, is
anoher uerly piacicable idea
I would sweep away he ime honored
and coirec mehod of represenaion
according o populaion inador
has suffered, inasmuch as she has
no been deal wih fairly according
o populaion in he presen legisla
ie apporionmen Sill we mus
admi ha we are no eniled o an
assemblyman alone Wo mus grow

carried, as i was reealed in a way
ha did no inole injury o life or
limb There is ille doub, how
eer, ha i was a scheme o kill
Ihia is how he sory is repored o
us
Sunday and Monday uuderground
operaions were suspended o enable
he company o do he necessary
work o adjus he safey cluches o
he skips On Saurday nigh one o
he drill men known as Liberao, an
Ialian— his correc name we beliee
is eVecchio— and his parner lef a
hole half drilled This was a he
2700 leel I is no uncommon hing
o leae a hole oer nigh i his
shape The finishing of he hole was
lef for Tuesday There were here
fore oer wo days ha he half drill
ed hole was lef On going o work
Tuesday, and coninuing he drilling,
a gian powder cap was reached afer
drilling a ery shor disance
The cap was exploded bu did no
damage Of course he fac of find
ing a cap in his manner awakened a
suspicion of foul play n in
esigaion was made, reealing a
deliberae and malicious, plo o kill
In he ineral of suspension o work,
some one had drilled a hole wih he
machine in a diagonal course, so ha
when he regular drillers compleed
he half bored hole i would srike
his unsuspeced hole This hole had
been charged wih eigh or nine caps
and wo sicks of gian powder
There was no fuse, and he opening
of he drilled holo was carefully
plugged up wih dir, so as o conceal
i By a miracle one of he caps wen
off wihou firing he res or explod
ing he powder Had he charge ex
ploded i would hae blown hem o
pieces
I is said ha eVecchio refused
o walk ou in he srike ha was
inauguraed a iuouh ago by he red
flag organizaion The supposiion is
ha his ourage was he ougrowh
of ha affair
The machine mus hae been shied
o bore his rap hole The drill
lef in he hole by he regular work
ers had been akea ou, and a shorer
one— he one ha had bored he con
cealed hole— had been lef in is
place The machine had been moed
back o is former place, so as no o
awaken suspicion The workers were
no aware of he subsiuion of drills
unil he whole plo had been un
coered I is supposed ha he
work was done beween Saurday
eening and Sunday morning
