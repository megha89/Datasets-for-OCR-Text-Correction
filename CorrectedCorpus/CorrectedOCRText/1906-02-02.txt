One day, a year and a half laer, he
missing husband walked Ino he house
He' looked abou as usual, and hung

"Nope ' I know hey hae only en,"

"re you going o sick o i?" '
"Till Idle"   
"nd I shall sick o sixeen"
He picked his eeh for awhile wih

rose slqwly up, walked 'oudoors and
was no seen or heard of again for oer
wo years His own people did no

"Jus as long as Sam Hasings can

His wife sa on he eranda sewing

"Nor you eiher"
"Feeling pury well?"
"Firs rae"  '
"So'm I"
Then hey discussed he neighbors

[Original]
The own of Brookmeadow was buil
on wo adjoining coniguous plos In a
far wesern erriory I was no a
large own, he Inhabians numbering
no more han 100 families, and nearly
all of hese were original selers The
people of Brookmeadow did no en
courage newcomers They were a hard
headed sor and did no ake kind
ly o mushroom growh "Wha good
would i do us," said a ciizen o one
who asked wha Inducemens he peo
ple would ' gie him o sele among
hem, "o ge in a lo of srangers? s
we are, we don' need any go'men ex
cep on special occasions No, sir, we
don' wan srangers"
One day a seler came o own who
did no ask permission— a sleek, oily
man who could absorb Informaion as
silenly as he sun sucks up waer, bu
neer gae ou any  few days afer
his arrial a "shingle" was hung ou
on he sree bearing he inscripion
"nhony Waxem, orneyaLaw"
Brookmeadow hus iar had no pro
fessional man excep a docor and a
parson The Inroducion of a lawyer
was considered superfluous, and he
quesion was raised wheher Mr Wax
em be allowed o remain "Wha's he
use adoln' anyhing," said old Hon
ker, "as will do iself? If a lawyer
can make a llin' In his communiy,
for my par I'd le him say I's my
opinion he'll sare" Old Honker's
opinion was held In grea respec In he
own, and i was decided ha he law
yer should no be Inerfered wih
When Mr Waxem had been In Brook
meadow hree monhs no ciizen had
gien him a case, and i was no be
lieed ha he had had a case He had
spen much of his ime away and had
• been seen by seeral of his fellow
ownsmen a differen imes a he
frame shany locaed a he couny
sea called he courhouse Bu, since
he had no law business and no pros
pecs of any, his early deparure was
looked for
One morning here was a surprise
sprung on he ciizens of Brookmead
ow When hey gahered a he pos
offlce o ge heir mall he posmaser
handed each and eery owner of prop
ery cared ou of one of he conigu
ous racs on which he own was buil
a noe bearing on he corner of he en
elope he name of "nhony Waxem,
orneyaLaw" The recipiens of
hese noes were Informed ha here
was a flaw in he ile of he original
rac whereon hen propery was lo
caed Mr Waxem had picked up he
flaw and for a consideraion would
gie a quiclaim deed o eery lo If
his was no saisfacory he gae no
ice ha he would begin suis of ejec
men
Thus half he ciizens of Brookmead
ow had been euchred by he man whom
hey had been waiing o see sare
or depar They were no an ex
ciable people, bu eery man lef he
posofQce wih a lowering brow Tha
eening a group of prominen ciizens
assembled In' he meeing house and
appoined a commiee o hae he rec
ords searched wih a iew o deer
mining Mr Waxem's posiion, and If
I was secure o ake such measures
as were necessary oward clearing he
ile Personal'Personal•;
I was one week before he commi
ee were ready o ac; hen hey wen
In a body o Mr Waxem's office Tha
genleman, being perfecly confiden
of his legal posiion and belieing ha
hey had come o offer a compromise,
hough he receied hem urbanely, re
soled ha he would no gie an inch
from his original demands" ' •
"Mr Waxem," said he chairman,
"we hae aken legal adice and find
ha you ae righ Bu hese people
bough heir los in good faih and will
no pay blood money Many of hem
can' afford o pay, and if you Insis
hey mus be urned ou of heir
homes Now, we hae decided o gie
up ha par of he own he ile of
which you are Ineresed in o you,
remoing all he houses o he oher
rac Will ha saisfy you?"
"Perfecly," said he lawyer, consid
ering he proposiion a bluff
"Wih one proiso," coninued he
chairman— "ha he propery held by
you ls o be used for a cemeery"
This singular proision somewha
puzzled Mr Waxem
"We shall need," coninued he
chairman, "a corpse wih which o
open he cemeery, and we hae
hough ha In order o do away wih
all dispue in  reference o he ile
ha corpse should be he person hold
Ing an undispued righ o occupy he
propery"
s he chairman spoke he las words
h© opened a package he carried under
bis arm rolled in an old newspaper
and displayed abou weny fee of
rope, a one end of which was a noose
Mr Waxem had by his ime caugh
he spiri of he argumen and urned
pale
"Since he dedlcaiai and opening of
he new cemeery," he chairman wen
on, "are appoined for omorrow afer
noon a 3 o'clock perhaps we'd beer
prepare he' corpse"
The chairman cas his, eyes o he
ceiling wih a iew o discoering
somehing o which he rope migh be
fixed Mr Waxem shook from he bald
spo on he op of his head o he soles
of his boos
"Maybe," suggesed one of he com
miee, "Mr Waxem would prefer o
prepare he corpse himself" Would
you, Mr Waxem?"
Mr Waxem promised ha he corpse
should be ready on ime, and he com
miee depared The nex morning he
law office was closed and he lawyer
nowhere o be seen He had aken he
hin and lef on he midnigh rain

CRITICISM
[Original]
I was siing in my sudy working on
a plan for a new noel when a seran
enered and Lauded me a cardPersonal "Miss
Gwendolin Phlpps"
I had neer, heard of  Miss I>hipp3,
and I especially objec o being iner
ruped by isiors, so I ried hrough
he seran o ge rid of her Bu I
failed and finally receied her
I was nd sorry I had done so, for he
momen she enered I saw ha she
would make an excellen model for
Bessie Gifford, a characer I was abou
o draw She was a peie blond and
as dainy as a canary She came in all
blushes and smiles
"Jlr Pendleon, I beliee— Paul Pen
dleon Such a loely name for an au
hor, and I noice you always selec
appropriae names for your charac
ers"
"Please be seaed, Miss Phipps, and
ell me wha I can do for you" 
"I came o hank you," she said,
sinking iao a chair, her silk dress
dropping ino graceful folds, "bu firs
I wan you o ell me how you found
ou he condiions beween Wallace
and myself?" \ V
"Wha condiions? Wha Wallace?"
"Wallace Onnsby, he hero of your
las noel, 'The True Ring' There i
Is," and she held up a gliering soli
aire on he hird finger of her lef
hand "I was ery nice of you o
ranspose his name and call him Onns
by Wallace Bu eerybody knew all
he same  leas I and my bes and
rues friend, Ida Goss, did Bu, hen,
she knew all abou hese roubles be
ween Wallace and me nd how you
did hi off ha mean hing, Irene Tew
ney You didn' call her by her righ
name a all, bu hen you couldn' call
us all by our righ names"
"My dear young lady, will you kindly,
ell me wha yon are alking abou?"
"Why, abou your plo for 'The True
Ring,' of course You haen' old me
how you go hold of i Ida declares
she didn' ell, and of course Wallace
couldn' hae done so id he?" r
She looked a me wih such a prey,
curious expression I had half a mind
o admi ha Wallace had gien me
he whole hing, bu I feared he false
hood migh lead o complicaions, so I
saidPersonal
"I would like you o ell mo wherein
he plo of my 'True Ring' coincides
wih your own affairs"
, "Silence gies consen I knew i
mus be Wallace who old you Of
course you had o promise him you
wouldn' say anyhing abou i Well,
Wallace and I were loers, jus as
Onnsby and Caroline were in he book
Then Irene Tewney, or Mabel Blake,
as you call her, wans him for herself
and inerpres he family secre so as
o reflec on Caroline (me) Wallace, de
spie he conincing circumsances, has
faih in me unil he applies he es,
and Caroline gies he rue ring of a 1a 1
real good, noble' girl The name Is
splendid"
Grea heaens! Is his all here is
o ha plo? Now I hink s abou
all he machinery on which I hung a
nework of suble inrospecie philos
ophy which I and high grade criics
consider uniquely Pendleonian
"You hae no ye old me," I said,
"he denoumen as s in he real case
— you? case"
"Why, jus as s in he book, of
course You didn' change I a bi
Wallace applied he es exacly as
Ormsby did, and I responded (blushing)
jus as Caroline did"
"Has I occurred o you ha your
loer read my noel and finding a
similariy in my imaginary plo o his
own and your condiions concluded o
es you as he did?"
"Well, I declare! I neer hough of
ha I wonder if he did?" ;;
"fer all my characer pus a gen
eral case ha has occurred beween,
housands of loers I admi here is
an ar in his in he book ha would
be impossible in real life, hough s
inended o represen real life"
"Ormsby was perfecly loely, and
Wallace was perfecly loely oo He
didn' use he same words as Ormsby,
bu hey were jus as noble and good
and swee and nice"  
I groaned I had read hundreds of
criicisms on my book, bu his was
he firs ha sruck me as ingenuous
My criic wa3" one momen slapping me
in he face, he nex paying me he
highes complimens, a imes doing
boh a once 3  w
"Miss Phipps," I said, "insead of
your hanking me for bringing you
and your loer ogeher, which is all a
misake, permi me o hank you for
his isi I has creaed a reoluion
In me Hereafer I propose o wrie
noels ha will be enjoyed by simple,
ingenuous people Xow, I wan your
permission o use jou under an as
sumed name in my nex noel"
"Will you?" she cried, clapping her
hands "Will you pu me in? nd
Wallace?" she added imidly
"I'll pu you in s o W'allaco, I
don' know him, so I couldn', hough
I would like o jus o please you"
I chaed wih her for an hour, ge
ing excellen maerial, much of which
wen ino my new sory jus as she
spoke i I hae sruggled agains
small sales of my books before, my
only recompense being he approal of
a few high grade criics When my
nex book appeared I gained he more
subsanial reward of dollars
s Miss Phipps was passing ou of
my sudy door I was off in a dream of
wha I would make her do aud say in
my sory and so wrap in he imagi
nary ha I forgo he real flesh and
blood I was awakened by a pair of
arms being hrown around my neck
and a kiss \"

in he insallmen presened March 2
was gien he address of George H
Maxwell, execuie chairman of he
Naional Irrigaion ssociaion In
iew of he early meeing of

daions, which follow, are imely and
aluable
I hink he misake we make oday
and always hae made is in looking
upon his quesion of foresry as in
any sense a secional quesion I U
necessarily as much a naional ques
ion as is he mainenance of an army
or he consrucion of a nay (p
plause)
I wish I had he power by some"
elepahic process of impressing upon
he mind of eery man presen he
picure ha is in my own mind as I
sand here
I crossed he Mississippi rier on my
way o he wes a lile oer wo years
ago on a ferryboa on which was
loaded a rain of oerland passenger
cars; and as we crossed ha grea
rier opposie he ciy of New Orleans,
during one of he greaes floods in
years, he waer was almos up o he
ops of he leees on boh sides of he
rier I was a serious quesion
wheher he ciy of New Orleans was
no in danger; and as we landed on
he wes side of he rier we looked
down oer he bank and saw he plan
aions away down below he leel of
he waer and exposed o oerflow and
desrucion any momen ha aiJIcial
barrier migh break Before we had
gone wenyfour hours farher wes 
he leee did break and one of hose
grea creasses was formed and I
pracically desroyed he <jiP for ha
season oer a large area oher
localiies and he ciy of New Orleans
were saed by he diminished pressure
of he flood on he adjacen leees
(Coninued on nex page,)I could no help, hinking o 'jhyself
wheher i migh no be possible some
aay or oher o awaken he people of
he Mississippi alley o a realizaion
c he fac ha foresry is a problem
exending from New Orleans o he con
inenal diide of he Rocky mounains
on he wes, o Canada on he norh
and o he cres of he lleghanies on

Picking tea at Pinehurst is done by
a carefully trained and well superin
tended corps of colored children who
show great aptitude in this direction. la
stances haye 1 occurred of line plucking
by one child in a day of . over 50
pounds of greehleaf whereas the aver
age in the Orient hardly exceeds 20 to
30 pounds. Experiments at the Pine
hurst gardens show that tea from' all
modern climates could be made as pro
ductive here as at their source, a
change in climate and the difference in
cultivation and manufacture, having a
tendency, to affect the quality of tea
when prepared for the table.- This lis
the reason -assigned for the difference
in 'the American grown tea from that
of imported. The Pinehurst early sea
son tea is considered more delicate
and milder than that of cooler climates.
The autumn season tea is stronger in
color and , taste ' and resembles -the
product .from \the more, southern .re
gions of : the Orient
The Secretary of Agriculture believes
that there is an excellent field in the
United , States for a home i tea indus
dustryfor we, consume approximately
75,000,000 pounds of tea annually or
a little less than one pound per capita.
Our people, he says, pay at retail about
$40,000,0000 a year for tea as against
$150,000,000 for coffee and $1,200,000,
000 for alcoholic beverages. It has
been calculated that the American peo
ple drink 400,000,000 gallons of tea an
nually. We are primarily a nation of
coffee drinkers; in proportion to our
population we consume only about one
sixth as much tea as the Britain,
whether at home or In the colonies.
While the United States does not im
port the cheapest kind of tea, never
theless ' our importations are chiefly
of inferior qualities.' The first demand
of the American , consumer : is cheap
ness, and often-times he will purchase
tea of -poor quality on account of ac
companying allurements .of crockery

and other gifts. Nevertheless com
paratively small consignments of better
grades are imported for those who are
willing to pay for them.
Halt Coffee as Food.
A Russian army doctor attached to
the 2d Turkestan Rifle Battalion has
been making' some interesting experi
ments in the matter of nourishing sol
diers. Dr. Cyrillus Koljago adminis
tered to ten- men for ten days malt cof
fee'as their sola beverage, with the're
sult that their weight increased during
the time to the extent of 832 grammes
a man. A like experiment was' made
by giving tea to the same number of
men of similar constitutions and for
the same number of days, and in their
case the doctor certified a decrease of
weight per man to the extent of 520
grammes. He then put the twenty men
together back on to tea, and those whose
weight had been so signally increased
by the malt coffee had within ten days
lost 660 grammes a head. The doctor
now states what is very important to
notev namely, that his experiments have
led him to believe that it is not merely
the nourishing attributes of the malt
coffee which mark this increase,, but
that its effect is mainly to increase the
action of the digestive organs, enabling
them to draw from all other food taken
the utmost quantity of nourishment
each may contain.
An Insult to the Horse,
"Would you mind walking the other
way and not passing the horse?" said a
London cabman, with exaggerated po
liteness, to the fat lady who had just
paid the minimum fare. "Why?" she
inquired. "Because if 'c sees wot 'c's
been carrying, for a shilling 'ell 'aye a
fit," was the freezing ■ answer.
Philippine Cities.
There are four towns in the Philip
pines with a population exceeding
10,000 each, and thirty-five with a pop
ulation exceeding 5,000. Manila is the
the only incorporated city in the
islands, and its inhabitants number
344,732.
The Doekiag of Horses*
Agitation is promised to urge the pas
sage of laws against docking horses,
and owners of . horses are ■ being peti
tioned to join in the crusade. Dealers
never dock horses, except at the re
quest of a buyer. To offer a horse for
sale with a bob tail is to create the sus
picion that it is "second hand," one that
has seen service before in the city, in
stead of being fresh from. green past
ures. Yet the dealers rarely sign such
petitions. They declare that the opera
tion of docking is not excessively-pain
ful and is atoned for by the easy life
it leads to. To have the tail shortened
is the initiation the rough horse pays
to gain the comfort and light duties of
a private stable.
Fashion is not the only reason to act
uate the buyers in having their horses
docked,' but it is the principal one. A
few say that the shortening of the tail
makes for cleanliness, as the tail does
not become draggled with mud and dust
when docked, and another set ; main
tains ■ that it : is really a comfort . to . a
horse to remove the heavy useless mass
of hair. City horses do. not graze in
pasture, 'so the argument^' that the
switching . of the long tail keeps away
mosquitoes and flies ;has no .value in
this argument; but a decided ,' objection
may be voiced' against the j nuisance
switching tails would be, to ah orse or
pair in heavy harness. . All .' style and
grace in front action, a pair with hang
ing tails , would look as untidy j other
wise as a woman in bedraggled' skirts.
So said a coaching amateur, and he had
plenty to add "to the plea for docking.
"Essentially docking is not ' a painful
operation,", continued this driving man.
"We do not feed; the , horse on" the
morning of the operation, and when it
is brought into the operating stall the
horse at once begins to munch eagerly
on; the oats in the , manger. A "canvas
hammock is flung under its . belly and
the horse iis hoisted to its tiptoes by
pulleys, when a gate is stuck across the
stall close to its heels and the tail pull
ed over, the flat top rail making an
operating table.'- A stout twine is tied
tight about the tail at the point to be
severed. The hairjs turned back and
bound, exposing the bare skin. \■-.-"A\ ■ -.
"A few short jabs with a surgeon's
knife and the tail is severed. Mean
while, a cauterizing iron has • been
brought to a white | heat in a
hand fire, and the next act is' to ' sear
the cut with the iron. 1 The \ horse
winces/but it doe 9 not take the terrth
part of a second to seal up the wound.
As loon as the iron is taken" off the
horse will resume its munching of oats,
and except j while the cauterizing ircn is
applied it feeds without a check through
out the entire operation. f.'\i-
. No one knows what the horses think
about it That docking is cruel may be
granted, but the gairts io the horse
seem to counterbalance the" hurts.' - All
of which sounds a good deal like an
argument made by an interested party
as an excuse I for a continuance of a
practice almost universally condemned
A Perfect Example.
A lawyer whose mouth was extra*
ordinarily large, had on the witness
stand a Southern backwoodsman. Thel
witness had replied to a question that
"It was a rion-possibility." Quoth the
lawyer: "'A non-possibility"? Now"
will yon tell this court and this jury
what you mean by a non-possibility?
Give, us an example." "Well,", said
the witness, "I think it 'u'd'be a non
possibility to make your mouf .enny
bigger widout settin' your years furder
back," . '
Was a Proper Judge.
When the last Cleveland baby was
born, Mr., Cleveland was asked about the
weight, which he gave at twelve pounds.
Dr. Bryant, who was present, interrupt
ed the ex-President to say that the nurse
had reported the young hopeful to be an
eight-pounder. "Nothing of the kind,"
said Mr. Cleveland. "I weighed him
with the same scales that I use when I
go fishing."
Death.
_ _ __.
(G. E. M.) «^S
I am a microbe of vast and fearful power.
My name is Death, where e'er I'm found.
I float through the air and sink '
into the vitals of the sons of men:
The youth In Joyous spring of life;
The man, mature In years and' strength;
The new-born babe and she .
Who watches tenderly his breath of
life: ■
The coyish maiden, and the sage
Of tottering steps and silver locks; \
All alike grow faint and listless.
Weak and wan, and sink at last
To their eternal rest, beneath my glance.
Quietly at first I work, mid 'jest and
• laughter.
But not more surely does the sun sink low
behind
The western hills
Than I make felt my power
Through every limb and fibre of my vic
tim's frame.
'Tls said that he laughs best who laugheth
last;
And I laugh last, yea many a million time
As I perceive my victim gazo with hollow,
vacant stare »
And note his breath come short, and
gasp»and — cease.
Ha! Ha! Another triumph of my prowess!
And now I float away to murder once
again —
To snatch some maiden from her lover's
arms;
To strike a youth, his mother's all:
Ceaseless my work. I know not pity.
Greedy am I, and each one whom I slay
adds fuel to my greed.
So do I live and reap my harvest day by
day of Death.
He Had Had Experience.
As the fearless white man entered the
kraal of the native : king, a salute was
sounded on a drum of serpent skin, and
six warriors with necklaces of human
teeth rattling about their throats, led
him before a rough ivory dias, on which
sat a majestic and . formidable figure.
"Hail,", said the white man. . And with
out loss of time, he took out one of his
brass watches, wound it up, and showed
its works to the dusky monarch. "This
marvel," he said, "I will - give - your
majesty, I making you the - envy of all
men, and in return for only six tusks
of seventy pounds' ; weight each. The
king took the watch,' produced a mo
nocle from a* pouch hidden in his shield,
and, after a j moment's study :of the
brass trinket, returned it with a languid
smile. "Last year," he added, "in Lon
don, I exchanged an old wooden war
club for a bushel of these things,, and,
by Jove, don't you know, ' there wasn't
one of them that ran above a week."
