AFTER THE BATTLE
A VETERAN'S STORY OF A TASSELED
TURKISH FEZ
The Grewsoine Incident In Which He
Participated at the Second Battle
of Manassas— A Brave Boy and his
Personal Dying Request
"Whenever I see a tasseled Turkish
fez," said a Confederate veteran whose
attention bad 'been attracted by a
smoking cap of that pattern in a Canal
street window, "I am reminded of a
curious and rather grewsome incident
of my campaigning- days It was on
the morning after the second battle of
Manassas," he continued in response to
a request for the story,' "and several of
us from my company had gone over to
the field in the hope of picking up a
few things that we badly needed and
for which the dead bad no further use
—waterproofs, for Instance, and sound
canteens
the previous day's engage
ment you " may remember that a  regi-j
ment of freshly recruited New York
zouaves held the crest of a hill and
were charged and almost annihilated
by Hood's brigade 1 They were mowed
down like ripened grain and fell so
thickly that their corpses literally car
peted the earth I dare say It was as
awful a# slaughter, considering - the*
number engaged, as occurred anywhere
In the course of the war '-' Hi "• •• i
"Well, we hadn't gone very far when
we came to this hill and began to get
among the dead men The poor fellows
had been mustered into service less
than a week before, and they were said
to be the most gorgeously uniformed
military ; troop ever organized   They
wore scarlet Turkish trousers, blue
jackets embroidered with gold bullion
braid and purple fezes with long pend-
ent tassels
"Being just from the outfitters, all
this fine regalia was perfectly fresh
and new,' and somehow or other It
added to tbe gbastliness of the specta
cle on tbe hillside] The corpses were
In all sorts of strange postures, and
their fantastic costumes gave them an
air Personal of horrible grotesqueness that I
couldn't begin to describe in words } '
Personal' "However, to come -to my point, I
had picked up a fez to carry away as a
relic and was about to leave the spot
when I  happened - to ' notice ; aPersonal much,
handsomer specimen on the head of, a Personal
little zouave , Btretchcd out, stiff and
stark, a few yards away, with a hand
kerchief over bis face ' I stepped up to
make a 'swap,' but had barely touched
the - tassel ! when a low; sweet toned;
voice under * the handkerchief said,
,'Please don't!' • '-;;/; <• i
"For a moment," continued the veter
an, ''that unpleasant protest,  coming
from what I had supposed to be a
corpse, made my hair bristle on my
head Then I lifted the handkerchief
and was shocked to seethe delicate,
refined features, of a boy not over 15
He was pale as death' aud ' evidently
desperately wounded, but be looked at
me calmly  'My God,* Personal I exclaimed,
'what a lad you are to be here!' 'I'm
afraid I'm dying unless 1 have help/
he replied 'Do you think the surgeons
will be around "pretty soon? 1 The Lord
knows!' I groaned, for the boy's cour
oge touched me to the heart 'Your
surgeons have all run away, and we
only have a few, with more wounded
than they can attend to' 'Then I guess
all I can do Is to He here quietly and
die,' be said In tbe same gentle voice
'Can you get me a little water before
yon go?' rs •-Personal •
"I took his canteen and hurried down
to a branch at the foot of the bill,
where the first thing I saw, by the
way, was the corpse of a zouave float-
Jng In a pool I went up the stream far
enough to get out of tbe horrible death
zone, filled the canteen with pure wa
ter and was soon back at the boy's side
I gave him a drink, and be thanked me
'Is there nothing else I can do?' 1 asked
awkwardly, because I knew our com
pany, was under early marching orders
that morning and that It would be Im-
Itossible for me to linger much longer
•Nothing as all, thank you,' he replied
'No message to anybody? 'No; noth
ing,' thanks'-'Personal - • -• 
"I turned away most reluctantly and
liad gone only a few yards when I
heard his thin voice calling  me back
'Excuse me,' he said, 'but I want you
to accept this as a present,' and be
handed me his fine purple fez 'No, no,'
I exclaimed, greatly 1 embarrassed; '1
couldn't think of taking It When 1
started to a little while ago, I thought
you— you'— Thought I was dead, of
course,' he Interrupted 'Well, I soon
will be, and that other fez will do me
Just as well Please put It on my head
and take mine' I saw that be would
be hurt unless I did as be desired, so 1
took the fez and went away
''In less than half an hour our com
pany was ou tbe march, and,' needless
to Eay, I never beard anything more of
the little child zouave He was badly
wounded and undoubtedly died where
I left him I kept the fez a long time,"
added the reteran "but It was finally
lost, with other odds and ends In tbe
general confusion following thc war
I'd give some money for it today"—

The Good Effects of Apple Eating
The apple is such common frnlt that
few are familiar with Its remarkable
efficacious properties Everybody ought
to know that the very best thing they
can dots to oat apples just before re
tiring for the night The apple Is an
excellent brain food, because It lias
more phosphoric add In easily digested
shape than any other vegetable known
It excites the action of the liver, pro
motes ; souiid -' and healthy j sleep and
thoroughly disinfects the mouth That
is not all The apple agglutinates the
surplus acids of the stomach, helps the
kidney secretions and is one of the best
preventives known of diseases of tbe
throat— Journal of Agriculture

A' Book Hunter's Worry,

We once knew a man who had a firm
belief In the devil and for this reasonPersonal
He said that he could hardly count the
imperfect books'by which he bad been
misled In his time, aud in nearly every
case these books had a highjy respect;
able past They had grown mellow In
monasteries or had been carefully tond-j
ed in great libraries, wliciv tlsev were
never touched i-xcept to be dusted It
seemed - morally impossible that harm
could have come to these books, and
yet each one had a page missing some
where Therefore he was reluctantly
forced to the conclusion that the devil
was In it He supposed that when the
devil was in- need of more quotations
be abstracted a page from some little
read book Choosing  it both in order
that lie might obtain a reputation for
wisdom'aad also that he might not be
found out ; -,

do recommend the book hunter, so far
as possible, to collate every book of
any importance which he "may con

Donbled the Fee
A clergyman who used to be a pastor
of a church In Kansas City says that
on one occasion he had rather an amus
ing esperiemy In marrying a young
couple in that city  " ,    j
 "The gentleman,", said the clergy
man, "was a liaudsome, noble looking
young man and the bride to be more
than usually beautiful It was plain to
be seen that the prospective groom
thought he had secured the one prize la
all the matrimonial market and was
correspondingly elated
"Just before the' ceremony the gen
tleman banded me tbe marriage license
to see that It was all right Inside the
license there was a crisp $3 note, plac
ed there as the fee The couple stood
up before the few^wltnesses In the par
lor, the ceremony was_gone through'

husband did wns to draw his wife to!

sweet lips It seemed to, thrill him

turning to me, be said, 'Parson I'll be

SPRINKLING WAGONS
The Modern Ones a Bis Improvement
on the Old Style
fv The modern sprinkling wagon is very
different from the old timer'? The chief
(improvement Personalis In- the' spray head,
which enables the driver to control the
flow of water much better than the old
style Thus, whether it Is a dirt or a
macadam road or a stcne paved or as
phalted [ street^  there can be supplied
from the 'modern street sprinkler Just
the ; amount of water required - to lay
the dust in It without waste
HThe spray head on each side has Its
own valve rod, running to the driver's
seat, with a step there for the foot
The driver * can operate, both heads at
or he can run only one head' He
off one or open either one at
pleasure/ With this sort of wagon the
expert ; driver i leaves' behind him dry
crosswalks ! with' perfectly defined, lim
its,' and when he comes to a carriage or
aLstreet 'car 1 upon -which "he" doesn't
want; to throw water he shuts off the
flpw^on-that side and keeps, the other
-going Sprinkling vragons are made In
various sizes, ranging from 150 gallons
to 1,000 gallons capacity There are 20
sprinkling wagons sold in this" country
nowadays _ where there were was one
sold only a few years ago This great
Increase In their use Is due In large
measure Personalto sanitary -reasons, to the
great extension of good roads and to
the common desire for comfort --
Sprinkling wagons are j used nowa
days commonly In many smaller towns
and villages where they were never
thought of some years ago  And Amer
ican sprinkling wagons are now found
all over tbe world wherever sprinkling
wagons are used -•-•Personal-

each man to "chip hi" a dollar or two

nate in tbe allowance for food supplies
|n" the navy ns between officer and en
listed man— that is, It did not up to a
year or two ago, when every, man in
the 6hlp, from the admiral down to a
coal heaver, received 30 cents each day
Now the discrimination is that tbe coal
heaver continues to draw his 30 cents,
while the admiral and all other officers
except the gunner, carpeuter pharma
cist, chief machinists and the naval
cadets receive absolutely nothing for
their subsistence on board ship Many
who visit naval Personal vessels and are enter
tained at dinner or luncheon are heard
to remark j that the government f pro
vides very good living for Its officers,
not thinking that the entire cost of the
repast has come out of the officers' own
pockets'  ,Personal    /    i   ,
The cost of an' officer's* living on one
of our vessels varies considerably -In
a port where much entertaining has to
be done  and  where  there are high
priced markets the mess bill, as it Is
called, sometimes runs as high as $35
or $40 a month for each officer and is
rarely less than $25 a month This rep
resents merely the actual cost of the
food and the Incidental expenses of-the
mess, as the government furnishes all
servants, crockery, fuel and table linen
In connection with this subject It
may be interesting to note that the cap
tain of a war vessel does not eat with
tbe other 'officers, but has a separate
establishment for himself and is pro
vided with a cook and a steward whose
only duties are to wait on him' On
flagships the admiral also eats alone
The wardroom mess usually Includes
all officers above the grade of ensign
and on most vessels consists of from
10 to 20 members Junior officers and
naval cadets constitute another mess,
known as the steerage mess— C A Mc-

WHITHER ARE WE DRIFTING?
-In our local columns we publish
- an extended report of the trial in
• the justice's court of Jackson of one
' McGregor, on a  charge of misde
meanor in exhibiting on the street
a lot of domestica* ;<d snakes, per
mitting a child of tender years to
 participate in the performance- We
do *Lis not on account of any special
significance attaching to the case in
itself, but because it serves to bring
' into strong relief the methods re
 sorted to in - the judicial centre of
Amador county in the prosecution
of Personal alleged crime — methods which
are fast becoming intolerable, and
which constitute a far greater men
ace to the freedom of American citi
zens than many of the paltry evils
they are trotted out to cure Should
any citizen venture to suggest that
tbe legal machinery,' supposed to be
'set in motion in support of the peace
and dignity of the people of Califor
i nia, is  running dangerously close to
the border realm of persecution, he
lis at once met with the cry in behalf
of the officials concerned, "But this
is law; we are simply doing our duty
in'trying to enforce the law" In
tbe presence of this appeal all op
* position is supposed to be silenced,
and the chorus of curses changed
into hosannahs of praise But we
decline to accept even this plea in
extenuation of official conduct in tbe
'particular case under consideration
 It is just as easy to persecute a man
under color of law as in defiance of
" law, and both forms of persecution
[are equally opposed to the spirit of
 the law • The sins committed in the
name of law are only equalled by
1 those perpetrated in open defiance
of all legal enactments Why, many
of the most infamous persecutors of
history reached their unenviable dis
tinction by just such a line of de
fence But this has not saved them
from the retributive verdict of his
tory; Their flimsy excuses are
shuffled out of sight by the hand of
time, and the naked infamy of their
'deeds alone remains to perpetuate
•their memory Law is merely the
concentrated wisdom of the ages as
to what is right and fair between
man and man When an officer out
rages public sentiment — the very
-basis upon which law rests — he to
that extent ignores the spirit of the
law, no matter how careful he may
be in keeping within the letter there
of Furthermore, we hold that when
an officer pursues an alleged offender
from motives of personal resentment
he; thereby forfeits all respect for
his official position, and stands out
as an individual persecutor So ex
tremely narrow is the dividing line
between legitimate prosecution and
persecution Law officers are not
to be commended, but rather con
demned,- for manifesting an over
whelming anxiety to affix*the stigma
of crime upon a defendant That is
nothing less than tbe spirit of perse
cution; which if persisted in cannot
fail to land its possessor outside of
the letter as well as the spirit of the
law  It is infinitely nobler to try to
stop wrong-doing in j its incipiency
than to wait until the victim has
overstepped the line, and then ex
ultingly pounce upon him, like
an eagle upon its prey
i; 'A man named McGregor, with wife
and one child, came to Jackson last
week They had a number of rep
tiles, and made a living by exhibit
ing on the streets or wherever they
could find an audience, their absolute
mastery over these snakes It was
not an attractive business, but there
was nothing wrong or dangerous in
it any more than in a menagerie of
chattering monkeys or other wild
annuals, which young and old are
delighted to see In their nomadic
life, they had wandered through the
greater part of California without
official interference, paying the li
cense fee wherever it was demanded
Strangers in every place visited,
they depended for protection upon
that love of justice and fair treat
ment which constitutes the bulwark
lof the liberties of a free people, and
which is especially strong in the
American character It was re
served for Amador county officials —
with the chief executive officer blaz
ing the way— to rudely shake their
dreams of hospitality and fair treat
ment lor the "stranger within the
gates" Three times the, man was
I arrested in less than that number of
days First, it was for non-pay
ment'of license 'But the license
money, was promptly paid when the
demand was made Where, then,
was the necessity of arrest when
the man was able and willing to pay
Is this the practice pursued with
•reference to resident license-payers?
Has any business man ever been ar
feste<3| I?*" eon-payment of license,
— *•,,- , !- • •
or even reported delinquent to the
district attorney?
Byithe payment of the license
tax was not enough to satisfy the
officer as far as the* snake charmer
was His business did
not suit the notions of some, and it
must be broken up if possible A
law, passed by the last legislature,
was dug up, which they thought just
fitted the case If they had looked
a little more closely they might have
found ithat their ground • for inter
ference, even from the standpoint of
written law, ' was a long way from
being as solid as they imagined But
they were not fishing with that kind
of bait Again the arm of law was
invoked to smite the "stranger"
This time the criminal brand was
to be impressed because the child
was made a part' of the entertain
ment It is probably the first and
only arrest under the new-fangled
statute made in California, and the
distinction is not one for Amador to
be proud of But the man furnished
cash bail, and found an attorney to
defend him, which upset all calcu
lations of a plea of guilty He pre
pared to do business the next night
He had the child by him, but did not
intend that she should take an ac
tive part in the snake exhibition If
the child had been allowed to wan •
der off on her own account, probably
the legal sense of propriety would
not have been so severely shocked
But she was under the eye of her
natural guardian, and a third arrest
was deemed the proper way to up
hold the majesty of unoffended law
He was not given the opportunity to
put up any more bail money until
next morning, but hurried, to a dun
geon as though he had committed an
unbailable offense Every effort
was made to stem the rising tide of
popular indignation, and insure a
conviction ; the nightly conclaves,
the efforts to prejudice the people
through a servile sheet, and by other
tactics equally at variance with a
defendant's right to a fair and im
partial trial But the jury failed to
convict, although punished by an all
night lock-up— a thing unheard of in
petty trials McGregor is still in
jail with his snakes To cap the
climax, another jury trial is an
nounced Justice has been deemed
satiated with one disagreement in a
murder case ; the dynamiters, the
incendiaries, the ghouls who in
broad daylight plundered the ruins
of Chinatown, are breathing the air
of freedom'; but this friendless,
homeless — aye, voteless — wayfarer,
whose mortal sin seems to have
been indulging in a little back talk
in the presence of officialdom, is
hounded from pillar to post, and
glorified by a second trial Ye do
"strain at a guat and swallow a
camel"
THE IONE ROAD
The sprinkling of the lone road —
and it is only sprinkled a portion
of the distance— is a failure Not
enough water can be got on it with
one sprinkling to keep down the
dust for twenty-four hours Of
course it is admitted that the high
way is improved for travel by the
sprinkling that is being done, but
the question is, Is the slight im
provement, worth the heavy outlay
involved As for the water preserv
ing the road, it is utterly inadequate
to accomplish anything in this di
rection The wear is just as rapid
with the sprinkling as without it
A great deal of money has already
been expended in this sprinkling
experiment, and the concensus of
opinion is that it is little better
than a farce Would it not be the
course of wisdom to stop this useless
expenditure, and turn whatever
balance of this fund remains into a
more profitable channel No one
will contend that the experience
gained will justify any effort to con
tinue it another season Many who
contributed to the fund are out
spoken in saying that they would
not have given- had the outcome
been known There is an agitation
now oh for oiling the road It seems
an offer has been informally made
by D McCall of lone, to oil the
entire distance, 12 miles," for $1200,
No doubt this is a very liberal offer
It certainly cannot be watered for
anything like that sum But while
some are disposed to urge, without
further ceremonjT, the acceptance of
this offer, we certainly cannot see
our way clear to do so Too much
haste has already been shown'in re
gard to new propositions looking to j
the improvement of the lone road, 
with the result that large sums of 1
money have been squandered The '
truth is the lone road bed is in no
condition at present to be treated
with oil A contract to that end
would inevitable end iv another
fiasco, and that too without in any
way involving the oil process itself
in the failure All authorities in the
southern part of the state; where oil
is used with success, are unanimous
in recommending that the road way
should be carefully prepared in tlje
way of turnpiking, etc, before the
oil U applied The lone road for the
greater part of its distance, has been
worn into ruts These rutij must be
filled up with rock or earth, and Jh,e
center rounded up to shed water,
otherwise tbe oil application would
not have a reasonable show of ac
cess If the oil process is to be
adopted, let it be fairly and intelli

INCORPORATION AGAIN
Our contemporary is again agitat
ing the question of incorporation
He would like to hear from any per
son having any solid reasons to urge
against incorporating Jackson  We
have been laboring  under the • im
pression that a good many, reasons
of the most -substantial' character
were piled up against^ the proposi
tion last March * Why; try to
resurrect an issue that has been laid
in its grave so recently? Does he
imagine that an issue is never set
tled, not even through the ballot
box, unless it is settled according to
his notions? Does he think that
the people are as changeable as \ the
wind; that those who voted against
it yesterday, would be likely to flop
and vote for it to-day Was it not
discussed for months before sub
mission ? Was not the discussion
allone-sided? The united press, the
office holders, the* church influence,
the floating population, without any
tangible interests at stake — all
working toward imposing upon
Jackson the costly machinery n of
local government And with all
this pull, the scheme miscarried;
after dipping into the county treas
ury to the tune of hundreds of dol
lars What is the motive behind
this spirit of perpetual trifling with
county funds We fear there is a
good deal of insincerity in' this re
fusal to allow the dead to rest The
potent factor in the defeat of the
plan four months ago, was the belief
that while many were no doubt
actuated by laudable motives, others
were pressing the fight "for revenue
only" Now, this everlasting ding
dong about incorporation by our co
temporary does not come with good
grac ' For him incorporation
would mean a very small additional
outflow of coin in the shape of extra
taxation, with a possibility of a con
siderable inflow of revenue in the
shape of city printing That seems
to be the real "nigger in the wood
pile" The talk about fever breed
ing smells, and that sort of thing, is
all moonshine "compared with the
self-interests involved
Now we are free to admit, that
circumstances have materially
changed since the election was held;
that arguments at that time deemed
all-powerful and conclusive against
the scheme, may not be applicable
now A law passed, by the last
legislature in relation to city and
county licensesand which is now be
fore the supreme court for interpre
tation — bids fair to change the whole
situation The main argument
against incorporation before, was
that the burden would fall upon the
business interests by the imposition
of a city license, in addition to the
county license now charged But
the supreme court has temporarily
held that a county license cannot be
demanded within the limits of an in
corporated town, where'the munici
pal authorities have imposed a li
cense tax Tf this view is finally
sustained, incorporation for Jackson
would not be so burdensome With
the license collections and road taxes
now flowing into the county treas
ury, diverted into a^city fund, Jack
son might possibly maintain a local
government with little additional ex
pense to the people With proper
management some of the revenue
might be made available for street
and other improvements Certainly
JacksOD derives no benefit in this

Homestead Contest Decided
Last week the decision of the general
land office in the homestead contest of
A Rechinello vs V Molfino, involv
ing 120 acres of land In Sec 6, Tp 6,
Range 12, was received at' the Sacra
mento land office The decision of the
Commissioner sustains the decision of
the local office in favor of the con
testant, and orders the homestead fil
ing of Molfino cancelled The facts of
the case are about as followsPersonal V Mol
fino filed on the land in February 1898,
and in April, 1900, Rechinello filed a
contest, alleging abandonment, and
failure to improve and cultivate Both
parties appeared at the hearing in Sac
ramento, with witnesses The case
occupied three days, R Webb appear
ing for contestant, and E A Roberts
for claimant The testimony* showed
that the essential element of good faith
on the part of the settler was wanting
The improvements consisted in cutting
from 50 to 75 cordsyof wood, and prepa
rations to get it out to market The
settler slept In the cabin at intervals,
but made his home at his father's
place, and kept his domestic animals
there There was no attempt at culti
vation, until after the contestant took
up his abobe on the land as an actual
settler The decision of the local
office saysPersonal
The testimony of claimant and his
witnesses did not establish satisfactorily
that he ever resided on the land as his
bona fide home; but it appeared there
from that such residence as he bad
practiced was merely technical, and
not in good faith, but simply to pre
vent a forfeiture by reason of not being
absent from the placo for a period of
six months at any one time The wit
nesses who had lived in the immediate
vicinity, and who, frequently passed
over the land and in view of the cabin,
testify that there was no indication of
the place being inhabited as a place of
residence, and that from all appear
ances the applicant made his home
constantly with his parents some two
miles from his claim From a careful
deduction of all the evidence and the
conditions apparent therefrom, we are
of the opinion that the homestead
claimant never, at any time, resided
upon or cultivated his homestead in*
good faith, or in a manner contemplat
ed by the homestead law, and that the
intent of the homestead laws, which
were intended for bona fide ; settlers
should not be defeated by a bare tech
nical pretense of a compliance with its
requirements, which is evidently the
fact in this case

A FAMOUS TRIAL
J C McGregor Tried for a
Misdemeanor
SHERIFF GREGORY ATTACKED BY THE DEFENSE
The Fiery Eloquence of Macquarrie
' and the Beautiful Sarcasm of
;_; District Attorney Vicin" -'
J C McGregor, the man who was
arrested by the sheriff for exhibiting a
child of tender years, was on trial last
Monday In the supervisor's chamber,
Justice Goldner presiding The case
was called promptly at 10 a m, and
the work of selecting a jury was com
menced The first panel was exhaust
ed at noon, with' only four jurors ac
cepted A second venre was ordered
summoned, and court adjourned until
oneo'clock
District attorney " Vicini represented
the state, while attorney Neil Mc-
Quarrie appeared for the defendant
After a coujile of hours spent in select
ing the eight remaining jurymen, busi
ness commenced I  ;
| The first witness put ou the stand
was the little girl— the little snake
charmer— whom McGregor was accused
of exhibiting contrary to the laws of
California She simply testified that
she was nine years old, and that her
name was Ethel Felton; that "Queen
May" was her mother Attorney
Vicini asked her if she liked to handle
the snakes, and she said that she was
not afraid of them "for they won't
bite"
Mrs McGregor, otherwise known as
"Queen May," mother of the child,
was then called to the stand, and she
was put through the paces She swore
that the child was her own by a former
husband, and that McGregor was her
second husband ; that she was the busi
ness head of the house and that her
husband was her employee or business
manager, and that her business was
that of palmist or fortune teller
During the testimony of Mrs Mc-
Gregor the attorneys had several
pretty passages, and once or twice it
looked like there might be a mix-up,
but they would stop in time Attorney
Vicini demonstrated that he was a
master at gentle sarcasm, by making
some pretty insinuating remarks that
attorney Macquarrie construed as re
flections upon the character and chas
tity of his fair client, "Queen May,"
and like the knight of old he was not
slow to shy his castor into the ring and
proclaim his willingness to do battle in
defense of the good name of the lady
It Is conceded that in the future the
fiery "Mac" will be known as the
champion defender of female honor of
the local bar
One witness testified that he saw the
defendant McGregor, driving through
the streets with a buggy or light wagon,
and that the little girl was standing
beside him with the snakes crawling all
over her, some around her arms and
one twisted, around her neck The
witnesses were pretty unanimous in re
gard to the fact that the girl was on
exhibition with the snakes wound
around her neck and arms, also that
the child would put the heads Of the
snakes In her mouth
F Burgin swore that he would not
know a copper head snake or a Jap
anese tea snake if he should meet one
in the road ;' *"**•
Many other witnesses testified that
they saw the girl playing with the
snakes at the free exhibition in front of
"Queen May's" tent, which fact was
not denied by the defense
One witness swore that the defendant
McGregor, said that the girl had been
bitten in the eye by one of the snakes,
but this was denied by her mother
The cage containing the snakes was
in court and was placed in evidence
The attorney for the defense, Mr Mac
quarrie, demanded that each snake be
labeled and marked separately as an
exhibit, but the court could find no one
to do it but himself, so he courageously
tacked a paper on the outside of the
cage "Queen May," while on the
stand, opened the cage and took the
whole bunch of reptiles out and into
her arms, showing the court and jury
that they were harmless, and scoring a
point against the court house authori
ties by calling 1 attention to the fact that
her pets had not been fed since they
had been in jail, and remarking "if
that is not cruelty to animals I do not
know what is  She testified that her
name was Eva May McGregor She
was called to the witness chair several
times, and upon one occasion showed
her love for sheriff Gregory by tolling
how he struck her husband twice with
a club when he made the arrest, and
how," when she rushed in to protect her
husband, he, /the sheriff, struck her
with his club and knocked her against
a wagon She also swore that he used
vile and indecent language to her
That the sheriff struck her was swor n
to by several other witnesses, but was
contradicted by his own testimony;
also others who saw the arrest said
they did not see him strike the man
nor woman either for that matter
Several testified that Gregory used
some rough treatment, such as jerking
and shoving him along while on the
way to jail, which was contradicted by
the sheriff and other witnesses for the
prosecution
"Queen May" was somewhat vindic
tive in her manner while testifying in
regard to the treatment she had re
ceived at the hands of the sheriff She
also swore that the snakes were the
property, pets and playthings of her
child, and she being the mother of the
little girl, supposed she had the right
to allow her child to have Whatever
playthings she wished to She said
that she and her husband were married
in Illinois about two and a half years
ago and that she came to California
about one year ago
A witness named Digitil, a miner at
the Argonaut mine, seemed to be some
what* qmpfaattQ ia his evidence, tad
evidently derived some pleasure from
being permitted to swear that he saw
the sheriff pull a "billy" or club from
his hip pocket and "strike him- a good
lick"
When sheriff Gregory was put on
the stand he was very, temperate and
conservative in his testimony He
testified that McGregor had told him
that "Queen May" was not his wife,
but that he was her employee and was
paid a salary of ten dollars per week
He claimed that he arrested him each
time for causePersonal First, '/lor running a
show, without license;Personal second, -for ex
hibiting the snakes and little girl, and
the- last time for exhibiting a child
under fourteen years of age Mr
Gregory acknowledged that at the last
arrest he caught , McGregor by the
shoulder, drew his billy and took him
to jail, but justified his actions because
the defendant refused to carry the box
of snakes to jail with him, also because
McGregor caught hold of a wagon and
refused to ge with him
After the evidence was all in the at
torneys prepared themselves for the
greatest contest of their lives Mr
Vicini, having the advantage of two
arguments to one for Mr Macquarrie,
was rather mild in his opening address,
contenting himself with telling the
jury what kind of argument the at
torney for the defendant would present
knowing that he would have the last
speech „ After a short preliminary he
yielded the floor ( to Mr Macquarrie,
who\ was ' duly, prepared for a  great
effort He read the law to the jury
and then commenced his argument,
dwelling upon the fact that "Queen
May" was the mother of the child,
consequently her legal guardian, while
McGregor, who was ctiarged with; ex
hibiting the child, in fact, had nothing
whatever to do with the girl as her ex
hibitor, but that her mother "Queen
May," was the real exhibitor That
McGregor was simply an employe of
the exhibitor of the child and could
not, in law, be held for the act of
another After dwelling on the law
points as long as he thought necessary,
he began to pay his respects to the
sheriff, who was the prosecuting wit
ness in the case Warming up as he
proceeded, with his speech, he charged
>Mr Gregory with persecution, of
using his official position to wreak per
sonal spite, of being a czar, and;in the
most emphatic language declared the
Sheriff, to be the servant of the people
and not their master -  ' -'
Mr Vicini, in his closing argument,
went deep into the law and showed by
his earnest manner that his heart was
in the case He appealed to the jury
men, as fathers, whose duty it was to
protect, the children of the land, to
put their seal of condemnation on such
actions by making an example of the
defendant and find him "guilty"
The case was submitted to the jury
at about 8Personal30 p -m, and 7 they, were
locked up in the supervisor's room
They deliberated all night and could
not come to a conclusion," so they were
discharged about six ''o'clock next
morning, The jury stood eight to
four in favor of conviction ; They were

Prouty Discharged  0
- In the matter of the assault upon
Manuel Garibaldi some time ago, and
for which two men, a Mexican named
Kossuth and a man -named Kil brain,
pleaded guilty, and  are now serving
sentences of one hundred and fifty days
and one hundred' and sixty' days re
spectively It seems that Garibaldi
was not satisfied, as he claims that he
was not assaulted by Kossuth and Kil
brain 'alone, but that while prostrate
with these men pounding him, he saw
Will Prouty approach with his black
snake whip in his band and strike him
the blow that broke his jaw As
soon as Garibaldi was able to be out he
went before the district attorney and
procured a warrant for Prouty's ar
rest"" He was examined before Justice
Goldner last Tuesday, and the ) justice
concluding that the testimony was not
conclusive enough to bind him over to
the superior court, discharged Prouty
Attorney Spagnoli appeared as special
prosecutor, and Mr Caminetti defend
ed Prouty

Genuine Begret
It is with genuine regret that the
people of Jackson learn that they are
to be deprived of the pleasures , they
have had for some time in attending
the nightly shows of Hal the Healer
But few shows in the country would be
welcomed with the same degree of
cordiality were they to again visit
Jackson Nothing but words of praise
can be heard of the conduct of every
member of the 'show from Hal himself,
down the line Hal, we believe to be a
gentleman of honor and most- certainly
he is thoroughly conversant ^with
his profession His courteous treat
ment of those he comes in contact with,
and his fair dealings with those whom
he has business with, certainly entitles
him to the respect of the public We
cordially recommend him to our sister
city, Sutter Creek, where he goes from
here, and should he ever visit Jackson
again he can be sure of a warm
welcome

Peculiarities of Asthma
The peculiarities of asthma are well
known,Personal and one New ! York  woman
thinks thnl she has more than usual
reason to complain of the vagaries of
the disease She had always lived in
the lower part of the city on one of the
avenues distant from the two rivers
and had' suffered in no unusunl degree
from asthma when the  weather was
not unfavorable The doctor was not
consulted when her husband bought a
house in another part cf the city, and
It Is indeed doubtful if he could have
foreseen the effect upon her of living
in the now neighborhood
It took the sufferer only a few hours
to realize that it would be impossible
for her to live in the new house, which
was only n short distance from the
North river/  Her discomfort became
so great that she was compelled at the
end of a week to give up^all attempt to
reside there, and the house that had
been built with so much care and ex
pense had to be nbandoned
Another, example of the -vagaries of
asthma is to be found in the case of a
New Yorker who is comfortable enough
in this city so lorg as he lives on the
upper stories of a lofty hotel or other
residence building, but is in great dis
tress so soon as lie Is compelled to be
on terra firnia- New York Sun

TIMING YOUR TRAIN
Wars In Which to Learn How Fast
Yon Are Traveling-
'There has been some j picturesque
fiction written about the ease with
vUJch railroad men and drummers are
supposed to tick off the miles as the
train speeds along, from things they
can see from the car windows," 6af3 a
railroad conductor toa reporter' Personal pi •
"There Is only one strictly accurate
way, and that Is to seat yourself on the
6lde of the tram from which may be
observed the white mile posts that line
tho road and hold your watch on them
If you have a split second watch, It
will prove  Interesting ' to ; note that
while you made one mile ln GO seconds
the next was covered In 63 and the
third In 70 seconds, and bo on, as the
6peed of the tram increases or Black
ens ' Tou may also follow around the
little  second  hand on an  ordinary
watch It kills time
"Some pretend to say that they- can
tell tho speed of the train by counting
the tfl ; 'S!\i;ih poles" If there were an
exact number of telegraph poles to ev-'
cry mile, this might be done by a little
figuring, but there is a difference/ The
number of telegraph poles to "a mile
vary from 33 to 40, depending upon the
straight stretches and the curves in the
track, the latter having more poles
than the former So, you see It is not
as easy as the drummer would have
the othpr passengers believe
/ "If the poles are planted 33 io'the
mile, they are IGO feet apart, and every
11 passed represents a third of a mlle r
If placed 40 to a mile, they nre 132 feet
apart, and every 20 represents half a
mile Personal''
"These are easy figures to remember,
and by applying them on a Journey, a
passenger may obtain an Idea more or
less accurate of the speed of the train
- "Anothor way Is to attempt to count
the clicks or i'Personalr wheels of the truck of
your car as they pass over the rails
where joined The rails of the roads as
placed today are too evenly joined to
arrive at an exact determination, by,
this method because Ifyou miss two or
three joints your calculations are
thrown out as to accuracy'
"However, there are railroad men
who cannot tell you the number of rails
to the mile of their own roads, and
rails vary in length, the average being
30 feet, some 33 feet and some CO feet
At 30 feet there are 17C rails to the
mile, and if you enn count 170 consecu
tive clinks as your train flies along you
may determine Its speed and not other

FEASTED ON SPARROWS
A Diet That Did Not Agree With the
Crane S
j "Some time ago I had occasion to ob
serve an interesting change In the hab
its and temperament of a crane which
had been picked up In the swamps of
Arkansas," said a gentleman from one
of the towns on the Mississippi river,
"and the change was startling too' The
crane was placed In a small park which
was literally tilledPersonal with English spar
rows These pests did not like the vis
itor fronrtlie lowlands, and they made
daily assaults on the poor bird The
crane was a pretty fowl, long, slender,
pure white and with tho stately stride
of a tragedian The sparrows would sys
tematically swoop down on the crane
in droves, and the attacks were fierce
and vicious
The crave stood the assaults with In
difference for awhile, but finally the
fowl from the swamps figured ;out a
method of retaliation, and It was effec
tual In some way the crane learned
that sparrow was a pretty sweet mor
sel,- From the time she learned It she
feasted on sparrows She would slip
up cautiously on these pesky twitterers
and throw her yellow beak out like a
gig"" She never missed the mark She
always landed a sparrow, and a singu
lar part of the thing Is that she would
swallow them whole, feathers and all
But the crane would always dampen
the bird by dipping It lv one of the wa
ter basins of the park •  ,
"The diet evidently did not agree
with the crane'aiid-she becameia trifle
droopy and showed signs of indisposi
tion She finally died, and the keeper
of the park believes that the crane's
death was "caused by a severe case of
indigestion brought on by eating spar
rows"—New Orleans Times-Democrat
Costly 'Wines
• Our millionaires think $75 a gallon
for rare old Madeira an utterly Impos
sible price simply, because their tastes
are blunted by champagne, and they
care no more for a bottle of Welsh Re
serve, i Newton-Gordon or Cliillings
worth-Oglethorpe, than for a cheap
sherry In the famous cellars of the
Hotel do Villeat Bremen there are 8;
dozen cases of holy wine which have
been preserved for 200 years A mer
chant figures out that if the cost of
maintaining the cellars, payment of
rent, Interest upon the original value of
the wine and other incidental charges
are considered a j bottle of this choice
Madeira has cost no less than $2,000,
000, each glassful $270,000, and a single
drop could not be sold without loss un
der $200
It is probable that thi3 very old wine
|s worthless on account of "starvation"
Charles Bellows, our ablest authority
on- Madeira, says that it becomes
"starved" after feeding upon its own
lees_ for 30 or 40 years "It seems to
me that it is very human and requires
companionship," he says "Demijohns
of the same variety should be blended
The marriage of the two wines would
probably give the lees more character,
and the wine would thus continue to
improve This certainly ought to be
done as a tonic after the Madeira has
been 50 years In glass"— New York

It Is interesting to recall that just
as Edward VII of England chose his
second baptismal name as the one by
which j he wished to be designated
when he mounted the throne, so like
wise his great-uncle, William Henry,

The Opal Superstition
-There is one superstition ; of wid
range ' and influence that  is directed
against one of the most beautiful ob
jects in nature, the opal A man In my
town' failed in business, and what do
you think he did? Took bis opal ring
into the yard and smashed it to pieces
with a hammer! He ascribed his bank*
ruptcy to that opal, and he Intended
neither to suffer such misfortune again
nor to allow any other one to do so by
Inheriting or buying that ill starred
property  _ ; ]\,'^~~ ''/,Personal-]
One of the most amusing Instances of
a * trust In wrong things Is' reported
from New Tork, where a man took an
opal to a jeweler and asked him to sell
It, as he had had nothing but bad luck
since he owned it, his business ven
tures having failed, his children having
suffered illness and the old scratch
having' been to pay generally •''The
jeweler found the gem to have been an
imitation  ' Its falsity must have been
obvious to everybody except the vic
tim,'because the opal is the stone that
has never been even passably Imitated
