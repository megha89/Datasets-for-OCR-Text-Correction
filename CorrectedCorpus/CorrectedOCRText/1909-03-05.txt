hospial affairs, wheher from he sandpoin of he comfor of
he inmaes, or he ineress of he axpayers, hae been
beer looked afer during he pas four years han a any
preious period in is hisory The inmaes are saisfied, he
public in general is saisfied o le well enough alone If
he proposiion were referred o a popular oe Lemoin would
be reained in his place by an oerwhelming majoriy, Bu
he democras hae four years of uninerruped conrol of
he couny's affairs before hem, and hey canno afford, in
he dearh of fodder in he pasure field under heir conrol
o le his berh go by unappropriaed by one of heir own
following While belieingha from a broadgauge sand
poin of public welfare he conemplaed change is an im
poliic one — one ha will be almos uniersally denounced;
sill from he exigencies of pary poliics do faul can be
found The democras are in power, democras wan he
place, "o he icors belong he spoils," is he pary slogan
I is no ofen ha poliicians, paricularly of he democraic
persuasion, can refrain from placing pary ineress fiis,
and public ineress second under such circumsances
The iniaion o resign, coming in he unofficial way, may
be ignored Perhaps ha is all he aenion ha will be
paid o i by he pary concerned Eery ac of his kind,
if inended o hae any pracical effec, should hae a place
on he official records There is no doub, howeer, ha he
whole maer has been discussed by he majoriy of members
on he board, and he successor o Lemoin decided upon I
is common rumor ha hree applicans are in he field for he
posiion, namely, W K McFarland,  B McLaughlin, of
Volcano, and  Burke of Plymouh The laer was seere
ly hur by being caugh beween wo joins of waer pipe
some ime ago in he neighborhood of Plymouh I is be
lieed ha his chances of receiing he appoinmen are he
brighes
If Lemoin sends in his resignaion in response o he un
official reques, of course hawould be made a maer of re
cord, and would end o clear he siuaion from he demo
craic sandpoin They would mee objecions by  saying
we did no urn down an admiedly capable public seran;
he resigned On he oher hand, if he fails o resign, he
probable oucome will be ha he office of seward, ec, will
be declared acan, and hereupon he democraic faorie
will be appoined o fill i While his may be a ery
morifying experience o one agains whose official record
no flaw can be found, i hrows upon he democraic majoriy
he full and undiided responsibiliy for heir acion
ssemblyman Moore's bill, changing he law in regard o
he compensaion of couny officers in mador couny, has
passed he assembly We presume his is he bill raising
he salary of he couny superinenden of schools from
$1200 o $1500 per annum There will be lile objecion o
his increase, which is generally conceded o be jus If
Oher changes are made , of he upgrade characer, here
would cerainly be a loud proes, Salaries are high enough

•stand to gain by such a convention to the extent that all the
world has many things in common; a famine or a flood in
one country may be felt indirectly in another. But America,'
a newer . country, and more profligate in wasting its re
sources, has much to leaini If the nations with more ex
perience and wisdom in this particular can be induced to
enter, America may learn a few things for which it will owe
lasting gratitude, to President Roosevelt. Already Roose
velt has been the largest figure working toward con

The Doctor's First Question
"How are your bowels?" This is generally the first ques-
tion the doctor asks. He knows what a sluggish liver
means. He knows what a long list of distressing com-
plaints result from constipation. He knows that headaches,
bilious attacks, indigestion, impure blood, and general
debility are often promptly relieved by a good liver pill.
We wish you would talk with your own doctor about
' this subject. Ask him at the same time if he approves
of Ayer's Pills. Do as he says. j.c.AyerCo.,Lowell.Af^.

of tbe Jaokson grammar school nnd a
team from the Union high school of

the proceedings by selections during
the progress of the contest, and a
goodly number of spectators gathered
to , witness tbe game. Krnnk Cuneo
of the borne team played a tact
game, and is entitled to muoh credit;
Tbe honor of victory, however, is
mainly due to Lesslle Love, who
leeing the Jackson boys were getting
the losing end in tbe eaily part of
the niatob, jumped In and plucked
victory from the verge of defeat, scor
ing enough points to deoide the event
In favor of county snnt team. Die
