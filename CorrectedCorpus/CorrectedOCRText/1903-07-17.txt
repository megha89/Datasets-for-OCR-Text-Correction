At the adjourned meeting of the di
rectors, the board considered the pol
icy of the operations at the mine "
The secretary's annual report" was
taken up, and it was found that some
indebtedness had been incurred during
the time the company has been endea
oring to force the tunnel through the
exceedingly hard formation encounter
ed three months ago" This was not in
conformity with the settled policy of
the board Letters were also read
from stockholders in the east, asking
reasons for not running the mill These
were duly considered, and after full
and complete discussion of the situa
tion, and in iew of the shortage of the
water supply, it was unanimously de
cided by the board to diert the ex
penditures from the crosscut tunnel
for the time, and to start the mill on
what ore reseres were aailable; also
to clear up all outstanding obligations
of the company The diminishing in

come from stock subscriptions making
it impossible to run the tunnel econom
ically and do any other work'it was
deemed that this course* would not only
satisfy the stockholders and" subscrib^
ers, but would enable us to clear up our
obligations, and if possible, accumulate
a cash resere sufficient o enable us to
resume I the operations !at j the tuunel
later on, without, rendering, the 'com;
pany liable to incur added indebted
ness
The superintendent was therefore in
structed to begin at once the milling of
such ores as are in sight, and to stop
work at the crosscut tunuel until the
water supply shall hae increased, or
until instructed to resume by the board
of directors

A COMMON CUSTOM
Man's Habit of Rnnnlne His Finger s
Through His Hair
| "Why does a man always run his
hnnd through his hair when he takes
his hat off?" asked an obserant man
"id you eer notice that man will in
ariably do this ery thing? Is it just
a nerous habit? Is it anity? It is
an old habit I liae neer known a
man who did not indulge tills habit
Een men who hae no hair to run
their fingers through,  men whoso,
heads are as bald as billiard balls, will
brush their, hands oer their heads
when they lift their hats If the uieii
simply wanted to smooth their tousled
hair, of course this would afford ample
explanation of the habit But wliy
should a man who has no hair on his
head do the same thing? It Is not a
sufficient answer to say that such a
man may hae liad a full suit of hair
at one time and that it is simply a
matter of habit contracted under dif
ferent conditions As n nilenion are
unconscious of the fact They do not
know why, how or when they run their
hands oer their heads But they all
do it just the same Go into a court
room or at any place where men cou
gregate and where it is necessary for
them to remoe their hats nml watch
them You will obsere that eery
man will go through the same perform
ance It seems to be a perfectly natu
ral thing for them to do , My own con
clusion is that it is an eidence of an
ity | A man wants his hair to be just
so • Originally probably it was simply
a matter of tidiness But it has grown
into an act of anity The lawyer, for
instance, if he has enough hair for the
purpose, will want his head to hae a
tousled appearance It gies him a
studious appearance and leaes the im
pression that he has been struggling
with the books  Whateer the reason,
the ; habit Is a curious one and one
which seems to be deep rooted in the
masculine nature" — New Orleans

Cinnamon is so extraordinarily sen

with regard to its surroundings on
board ship, as a bale of ery fine cin

aroma if packed among bales of coars

tried to remedy this The Portuguese
and utch isolated the bales by pack
ing them in cocoanut fiber or in cattle
hides, but it is, fouud that the only
real safeguard is to pack bags of pep

THE TOBACCO PLANT
Its Ortain, According to a Qnaiat
Legend of the East
The prophet was taking a stroll in
the country when he saw a serpent,
stiff, with cold, lying on the ground
He compassionately took it up and
warmed it i his bosom When the
serpent had recoered it saidPersonal
 "iine prophet listen I am now
going to bite thee"
VWhy, pray?" inquired Mohammed
"Because thy race makes perpetual
war on mine," said the serpent
i "But thy race, too, makes perpetual
war against mine," was the prophet's
rejoinder "How canst thou, besides,
be so ungrateful and so soon forget
that I saed thy life?"
is no such thing as gratitude
upon this earth," replied the serpent,
"and if I were now to spare thee
either thou or another of thy race
wruld kill me By Allah, I shall bite
thee?" ,Personal  
"If thou hast sworn by Allah I will
not cause thee to break thy ow," said
the prophet holding his hand to the
serpent's mouth The serpent bit him,
but he sucked the wound 'with his lips
and spat the enom on the ground
And on that ery spot there sprung up
a plant which combines within itself
the enom of the serpent and the com
passion of the prophet Men call this
plant by the name of tobacco—"To
bacco In Song and Story"
Win* and Temperature
The wind does not affect the ther
mometer, as any one may find out for
himself by a simple test Take two
dry bulb thermometers of exactly the
same kind and hang one of them where
it will be exposed to the wind and the
other where it will be sheltered— say,
on two sides of the corner of the house
—and after allowing^ them to hang
thus foria few minutes you will find
that they register the; same And yet
the person who stands near the ther
mometer that hangs in the wind will
feel the cold more sensibly than the
person who Btands near the sheltered
One > r  ' iTJ   ;  ; '
The wiSd is simply air in motion,
and air in motion is no colder than the
same air in a state of rest We feel
colder In the wind simply because its
blowing oer us takes the heat away
from the body by causing a more rap
id eaporation from the skin' There is
no eaporation from the dry bulb of a
thermometer,' and therefore the wind
does not affect it

Wagner as an Acrobat
Ferdinand Praeger related an inci
dent of a isit to Wagner at bis Swiss
home The two men sat one morning
on an ottoman in the drawing room
talking oer the eents of the years
Suddenly Wagner, who was sixty
years old, rose and stood on his head
upon the ottoman
At that moment Wagner's wife en
tered | Her surprise and alarm caused
her to run to her husband, exclaiming,
"Ah, Richard, Richard!" Quickly re
coering himself, he assured her that
he was sane and wished to show that
he could stand on hia head at sixty,
Which was more than Ferdinand could

Frog* and Snakes
The common snake is ery fond of
water Its food consists exclusiely of
frogs and fishes All snakes eat either
liing food, including eggs, or creatures
they hae themseles killed When
pursued by a snake the frog seems to
be half paralyzed with fear, leaping
less and less powerfully as the snake
approaches it more nearly and uttering
feeble cries If a stick be so pushed
through the grass toward a frog as to
imitate the moement of a snake the
frog will exhibit the symptoms of ter
ror just noted

"1 neer waste words on a fool," said
the pompous person
"That doesn't correspond with your

of the skeptical faction
"What did my wife say?" queried

"That you were in the habit of talk

WIL ANIMALS
Tbe ealers Get Most of Their Llonj
\ From Nubia
ealers in wild animals get most of
their lions from Nubia There the na
ties search for a lioness with newborn
cubs, kill the mother and bring up thfl
young beasts on goats' milk When
Uiey are two months old they are taken
to the coast on the backs of camels and
shipped to Europe Lions are also ob
tained from Abyssinia and Senegal
Formerly the Atlas mountains tarnish
led the finest lions, but the species now
no longer exists except a few speci
mens ,in menageries Adult Nubian
lions are worth $1,000 apiece, while
Senegal lions range in price from $500
to $750
Tigers ary in price from $375 to $1,
500 apiece and more, according to the
ariety and rarity of the animal Si
berian tigers, for instance, sell at the
latter figure They are large, beauti
fully striped creatures In the winter
they grow a long, woolly winter coat
Some full grown tigers are captured in
pitfalls, but most specimens of these
animals are caught while small cubs
and raised on milk
The hippopotamus, the rhinoceros
and the giraffe are difficult to secure
It is practically impossible to capture
a full grown beast of these species, and
the young ones are hard to rear 7 A
baby hippopotamus will drink thirty
pints of milk a day and a baby rhi
noceros almost as much Thus it re
quires the presence of a large herd of
goats in the wilderness to snpply milk
for such creatures A hippopotamus Is
worth from $2,500 to $3,000, a rhinoc
eros slightly more, while giraffes sell at
$2,500 or more, according to size, age
and condition ~i\~
Jamaica Crocodiles
 There are a good many crocodiles in
the more distant reseres of Kingston
harbor and at the mouths of the Ja
maica riers, but they are exceedingly
wary, and a most cautious approach is
necessary if one wishes to get close
enough for an effectie shot
i Just as the lion has his jackal and
the shark his pilot fish so the crocodile
is almost always accompanied by a
small ploer, which perches upon the
scaly ridge of its back and is just is
ible aboe the filthy water in which its
big patron loes to wallow
?" On the approach of man or any other
danger this tiny bird flutters into the
air and utters a shrill cry to warn its
"chum"
The crocodile dies, and you may sit
in your canoe and nurse your rifle for
an hour without a chance of a shot

man than most of its kind— Chicago

The Ladder warf
"Among the strange and weird de

by miners to hauut the workings un

'Ladder warf,' " said a former pros
pector "I neer saw the creature my

backed, with a short body, large head
jfnd enormously long and powerful
arms In fact, ' he I resembles an ex

is climbing the ladders by means of

to always do this just before an acci

The Rattle as a ecoy
That the rattlesnake uses his tall to
decoy birds has been obsered a num

Scientific American, who saysPersonal "The
snake hides himself, in the tall grass
and imitates the buzzing of a bee The
insectiorous birds, such as the phoebe
and kingbird, are attracted by the
sound and become an easy prey for his
snakeship I hae seen rattlesnakes
concealed in the dense foliage of trees
twenty feet from the ground practicing'
the same deception on the birds and

binister The latter turned round,
then again faced the audience ' "In
spite of de interruption," he said, j"1
repeat de tex' am from de secon' chap

the coat tails were plucked, and the
minister glared at the plucker, only to
turn once more to the congregation

COSTLY GOVERNMENT
From official figures furnished by
state controller Colgan jt appears
that it has cost the taxpayers of the
state $10,446,77336 to conduct the
business of the state during the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1903
Beckoning the population at 1,500,000, 500,000
this gies us $7 per capita for the
cost of maintaining the state goern
ment California has easily held the
lead as the most extraagantly go
erned state in the Union It is not
only maintaining its uneniable dis
tinction in this regard, but it is
steadily pulling further away from
all competitors Without attempt
ing to gie exact figures, we shall be
quite within the mark in saying that
this is fully three times the aerage
cost per capita throughout the
Union • Truly, California is a big
hearted state She prides herself
on doing things on a grander and
more liberal scale than other por
tions of the commonwealth The
financial intoxication born of the
flush pioneer days has held sway in
goernmental affairs through all
the years of statehood The disease
has become chronic, if not incurable
What hope of reform can be reason
ably entertained, when sessiou after
session our representaties are sent
to the legislature imbued with the
idea that their reputation as states
men will be measured by their suc
cess as raiders of the public treasury
for the special benefit of their con
stituents? That retrenchment is
the crying need of the hour they all
admit, but each member is fully de
termined that the cutting down
process must begin elsewhere than
in bis own political household ; in
fact, his particular locality needs ad
ditional financial bracing from the
public treasury to insure its sturdy
health, and the statesman's political
fortune _ " ; \
Our whole system is permeated
with the same prodigal spirit To
the state rate must be added nearly
ten dollars per head as the aerage
cost per year in Amador county for
the support of the local goernment
We hae a total of $17 per head an
nually for goernment in Amador
county The per capita for federal
purposes would materially increase
these figures, but this we will not
consider here, for the reason that
it bears equally upon all sections of
the country Instead of applying
the brakes to this carnial of ex
traagance, the eil is growing more
acute year after year
California is making strenuous
I efforts to gather population There
is room for millions of additional
homes within her borders Promo
tion committees are at work to in
duce emigrants to settle here And
eery argument of climate, produc
tieness, and healthful surroundings
can be truthfully urged to induce
settlement There is but one thing
that we cannot honestly claim —
namely, an economical administra
tion of public affairs Is this the
one thing needful? * Notwithstand
ing the work of immigration com
mittees, the state is not growing in
population as rapidly as her re
sources would seem to justify Many
homeseekers come, a large percent
acre do not settle The question of
taxation is our ulnerable spot The
head of a family seeking a location
is not apt to oerlook this ital sub
ject And the prospect of being
held up at the rate of a dollar and a
half per month per head for local
goernment is something new to the
general run of immigrants 'Califor
nians are used to this style of liing,
and think little of it New comers
are not used to it, and probably do
a whole lot of thinking about it
There is no gainsaying that the
most effectie work that can be done
for California today is to climb down
from the toplofty perch, and get on
common ground with other states
Progress in this direction must nec
essarily be slow, but to make a
beginning is the hardest part of the
work
LICENSE COLLECTIONS
There is one branch of the county
reenue system that promises this
year to loom up well by comparison
with former years We refer to col
lections from county licenses Tax
collector Norman has been in office
six months He has made two quar
terly settlements as license collector
The total paid in for the half year
is considerably in excess of the sum
receied from this source for a like
period in the history of Amador
couoty For the first quarter the
receipts were $2433, and for the sec
ond quarter quarter $255350; mak
ing a total of $498650 for the half
year This showing indicates a re
enue of $10,000 for the year Prior
to September, 1899, the license col
lections neer reached $2000 in any
quarter For Jhe last three years
of the preceding administration the
receipts, including the ten percent
commission allowed the collector,
were as follows Personal^ 1900, $910250;
1901, 1 5952150; 1902, $881850 ,Tbe
first half of the current year shows
an aerage of nearly $100 per month
oer tbe collections of the preceding
year This is a gratifying record It
shows that the collector is diligently
and faithfully attending to this im
portant Personal branch of c his duties as a
public officer
The surperisors will meet next
Monday as a board of equalization,
to raise or lower indiidual assess
ments as each case may require on
a proper presentation thereof From
unofficial figures published in an
other column, it will be seen that
the taxable property in Personal Amador
county has increased to the extent
of nearly $300,000 oer the figures
of last year, t This is ery gratifying
assuming that the raise is based 'on
an actual increase  in '^property
alues We do not know what class
of property is chiefly concerned in
these augmented figures We gie
elsewhere a list of tbe principal tax
payers of the county, which may
be of practical alue at this' time
The smaller property holders, upon
whom the task of contributing their
semiannual quota toward the ex
penses falls heaily, we are unable
to reach with such information
This is the time for eery property
holder to look up his standing on
the assessment roll, so that any
grieance he may hae on this parr
ticular score may be presented with
in the statutory time to the proper
authorities for adjustment

A VOICE FROM THE TAXPAYERS
Editor LedgerPersonal — Will you kindly
gie a small space in your paper to ex
press what I beliee to be the senti
ments of a large majority of the tax
payers of Amador county Maybe it
takes but little space to tell what tbe
ordinary taxpayer knows In fact, he
is not supposed to knowanythingabout
county affairs, except to pay his taxes
when they become due This is the
limit of his utility from an official field
of iew All the same, he is doing
some thinking, and the trend of his
thoughts is anything but compliment
ary to those who are responsible for the
present state of affairs lam aware,
Mr Editor, that it is getting to be a
little risky to think aloud; liable to
call for an inoluntary isit to the po
litical house of correction, so to speak
Conscious of this dager, and yet
giing you full liberty to mention my
name to any inquiring frieods as your
judgment may dictate, I rise to remark
that unless there is a more economical
management of affairs by our county
fathers and other officials, there will be
ere long "only a fow of us left," out
side of our county officers, who will be
able to supply pap in the shape of
property taxes to meet the eorgrow
ing demands of Amador county Some
thing has to be 'dono or this county
will be bankrupt
X I was looking oer the expenses in
curred and tbe bills allowed last month
It made me feol like selling what little
property I own in this county, and em
igrating to some part where county
officials pay more attention to the in
terests of the taxpayers, and hae some
regard for the people's mono
It seems to me that the offices of
county physician and health officer
ought to include all medical serices
for the county, such as the examina
tion of insane persons,
Another thing, taxpayers don't like
to be called on to pay the traeling ex
penses of officials who draw a big salary
from the county eery month, and can
well afford to pay their own expenses
Another complaint that is in eery
body's mouth is that tho superisors
ought to produce sworn ouchers co
ering eery dollar they pay out for road
work People want to know from the
published records the name of eery
man that works on the roads, tho num
ber of days and wages per day Let
eery man receipt for his own pay, the
same as the employe of any other cor
 In conclusion let me say that all we
want is for our superisors and other
officers to manage county affairs on
the same strict principles of business as
are applied to any well goerned public
or priate institution

There is more catarrh in this section

For a great many years doctors pro

failing to cure with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable Science has
proen catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti

An Unpleasant Experience
Last Sunday eening Eugene ean
and Arthur Roberts, two of Jackson's
popular young men, hired a swell horse
and buggy from Kelly's stable and
started toward Sutter Creek for a
moonlight ride But their plans were
"upset," or rather the buggy, on the
grade a few yards south of the north
shaft of the Kennedy mine The boys
do not gie a ery clear ersion of the
affair They were either run into by
another rig or carelessly droe off the
grade Howeer, the buggy was turn
ed oer a time or two, and the top and
body smashed beyond repair In the
mixup tbat ensued the horse's legs
became fastened between the spokes of
one of the hind wheels, which necessi
tated the sawing out of some of the
spokes in order to release the animal
The boys luckily escaped injury, but
are rather "upset" oer tbe unpleasant
ending of their eening's enjoyment
Kelly was obliged to telephone to Sac
ramento for a new buggy top and
body Of course this was done by re
quest of the young men in question
Early Morning Fire Alarm
At halfpast 1 o'clock this morning
the night watchman, Matt Joy, disco
ered that the inside of L Costa's black
smith's shop, near the National hotel,
was in a blaze He at once shouted
"Fire," and fired his pistol to gie the
alarm The fire alarm system was ap
pealed to, and failed to respond, until
some one went to the fire house and
rang the bell By this time the peril
was oer Jas Mortimer happened to
be around at the critical time, climbed
through the front window of the burn
ing building, got the hose that was
kept therein into play, and had the
fire under control before the fire bell
rang out its warning The building is
constructed of galanized iron, both
sides and roof There is nothinginflam
mable about it except tbe studding and
rafters These were burned to a cinder
for a distance ten or twele feet around
the furnace and forge, and the flames
were breaking through the roof around
the smoke pipe A hot fire had been
keep in the furnace the preious day
for heating tires The fires were drawn
early in the afternoon, and the coals
and ashes placed on the iron plate form
ingr the top of the furnace These must
hae kept alie, unknown to those in
the shop, and started the blaze in the
dead of night Loss about $50

Getting Along Nicely
Emanuel Garibaldi, who recently re
turned from a isit to his son Tony,
who is under treatment at the Chil
dren's hospital in San Francisco for a
ery serious gunshot wound in the leg,
says that the boy is steadily progress
ing toward recoery The Xray was
called into serice in determining the
condition of the wound On June 27th
the main operation was performed by
r Sherman, who cut out a portion of
the bone The patient stood the ordeal
well, and has been slowly but steadily
gaining eer since The father was
told that there was doubt that the leg
would be saed, although he will be
more or less crippled for life The
surgeon says if he is able to get him
off his hands # in a year from now he
will be well satisfied Tony bears up
choerfully, and has a good appetite

A Miner Wanders Off into the Mountains
and Perishes Alone
Will Bloom, while out looking after
cattle on the mountain range of tbe
Allen estate in the neighboorhood of
Wiley's station came across a ghastly
find It was last Sunday morninsr,
about 11 o'clock, in the bed of the
south fork of the Cosumnes rier, tbat
he discoered the partly decomposed
remains of a man The circumstances
surrounding the case pointed to a sud
den snapping of tho thread of life from
natural causes It was a wild and un
frequented spot, on the edge of the
rier, about two and a half miles north
of Wiloys Tho man had eidently been
attracted to this outoftheway spot
by the presence of water, and for the
purpose of slaking his thirst He bad
diested himself of coat, est, hat and
shoes, which article lay by bis side
The face was partly immersed in a pool
of water, and the position of the body
indicated that the death stroke seized
him while in the act of stooping down
to drink Hunger played no part in
his taking off, for cheese and crackers
were found in his pockets, also $275 in
money and a bunch of matches The
condition of the remains indicated tbat
death had taken place three or four
days prior to the finding of the body
Coroner Huberty was promptly noti
fied of the discoery, and that officer
repaired to the scene the following day
and held an inquest oer the remains
The body was soon identified as that of
Frank Careth a miner, about 40 years
of age; The jury reported that da
ceased came to his death from natural
causes; probably heart trouble, as the
eyeballs were bulging from their sock
ets The remains were coneyed to
Wiley's station and buried in that i
cinity eceased has no relaties in
this county It is reported tbat he has
a brother in Neada county, also a
brother in Montana
A brother arried from Neada City
on Tuesday, who had the remains taken
up and reburied in tbe Amador City
cemetery on Wednesday
The ictim wasknown to many around
Jackson and other parts of tho county
He had worked in the Zeila and other
mines It is said that the last place he
worked at was the Sbenandoah mine,
beyond He was addicted to drinking
at times What led him to start off
into the mountainous where he met his
sad and lonely end is merely a matter
of conjecture It is said that he had
worked in the mines across the moun
tains  In taking his last tramp it is
thought his motie was to reach the
mines of Alpine county, or the works
of tho Standard Electric Company at
Blue Lakes He was in Amador City
on the night of July 3, and was seen
around Plymouth on the 4th
A False Report
It was rumored about the county last
week that Gus Leerone and Vie Rocco
had resorted to the use of powder dur
ing their fishing trip to Siler Lake a
few weeks ago The report became
current owing to the fact that seeral
dead fish were found In the lake after
the boys had left This coupled with
the large catch that they made gae
rise to the rumor County game war
den Chez Arditto has carefully ines
tigated the subject and finds that there
is no truth in tbe report He ascer
tained that seeral fish were carelessly
thrown into the lake by parties that
had been fishing at about the same
time as the boys from Jackson The
fish had spoiled after haing been
caught and were thrown into* the
water without thinking as to what the
result might be Anyone acquainted
with Messrs Leerone and Rocco
knows they would not be guilty of such
unsportsmanlike conduct, and their
friends are pleased that an inestiga
tion was made, well knowing what the
result would be

AMAOU'S HEAVY TAYPAYERS
From tbe assessment roll of the cur
rent year we hae compiled the follow
ing list of all taxpayers in the county
who are assessed for $1000 and oer
Where the indiidual or company is
assessed for this amount in more than '
ono township, tbe aluation in each
township is gien Whero it requires
property listed in more than one town
ship to make up the amount, the tax
payer is credited to the township where
the bulk of tbe property is situated
In the hurry of going oer the entire
assessment roll, some errors hae no
doubt been made For all practical
purposes and comparison, the list will
be found substantially correctPersonal

SUPEBIOB COURT ECISION • *
ON THE JUSTICES' SALARY CASE
The decision rendered by Judge Rust
last Friday in the mandamus suit
brought by James McCauley, as justice
of the peace, against C L Culbert, as
county auditor, to compel the latter to
draw his warrant in faor of petitioner
for $35 as salary for criminal business
for one month, under the proisions of
the county goernment act passed by
the last legislature, is a lengthy docu
ment, embracing twele pages of type
written matter We hae no space to
gie tbe full text of the decision in
the Ledger We gie,  howeer, the
leading points made in granting the
writ The suit was contested on con
stitutional grounds; Ist, that the act in
question iolated the proision prohib
iting increase of salary of any state,
county or township officer during his
terra of office 2d, it is special legis
lation, in that it classifies the townships
according to population for the'pur
pose of grading salaries of township
officersPersonal Tbe court saysi
That the legislature has the power to
change during the term of office the
compensation of township officers from
fees to a stated monthly stipend there
can be no question Vail s San iego,
126 Cal 35 Counsel in this proceeding
makes no contention against this rule
In support of the issue of fact raised
by his answer that the salary proided
for by the legislatie enactment under
consideration is an increase of compen
sation after election and during the
term of office of petitioner, respondent
offered in eidence the criminal re
turns of the justice of the peace of
township two, together with the bills
presented by such justice for fees for
criminal cases and charges allowed un
der the statute prior to the amend
ment, and for the months from June,
1900, to and including February, 1903,
and in connection therewith offered
the testimony of respondent as county
clerk and exofiicio clerk of the board
of superisors thereof These offers
were all objected to upon the ground
that they were irreleant, immaterial
and incompetent
In passing upon the constitutionality
of a statute the court must confine it
self to the facts appearing upon the
face of the law, and the facts of which
it can take judicial notice, and if the
law, as then considered, does not ap
pear to be unconstitutional, the court
will not go bohipd it and receie ei
dence to establish facts whichwould
tend to impeach and oerthrow the
law
On tho other hand section 1090 of
C CP, readsPersonal "If an answer be made
which raises a question as to a matter
of fact essential to the determination of
the motion, and affecting the substan
tial rights of tho parties, and upon the
supposed truth of the allegation on
which the application for the writ is
based, the court may, in its discretion,
order the question to be tried by a juryi
and postpone the argument until such
trial can be had and the erdict certi
fied to the court"
Here we hae an apparent conflict in
our law, but a close reading of the cases
cited in the rule in faor of petitioner's
contention satisfies me there is no con
flict, but that these are casos where the
legislature has clearly acted beyond its
authority in amending claims in the
nature of gifts prohibited by the consti
tion
In the proceeding at bar the issue of
fact raised by the answer is deemed
controerted, and how can the court
arrie at a solution of the issue without
hearing eidence If I could aail my
self of tho objections of counsel, it
would be an easy way out of the dil
emna, for it would end the case, but
such objection, in my judgment, can
not be sustained The objections to
the eidence and offers of proof, so far
as they apply to the bills filed and al
lowances made to petitioner as said
justice of tho peace for the term begin
ning on the first Monday in January,
1903, and extending to the date of the
commencement of this proceeding, are
oerruled, and the eidence is admit
ted All eidence of these facts prior
to that time is objectionable, and the
objection as to that is sustained
It is the plain duty of the court in
passing upon a statute to endeaor to
gie effect to the expressed will of the
legislature, and uphold the laws en
acted by it, rather than search for
means of eading it It is not for the
court to question the wisdom or exped
iency of the enactment; that is the
proince of the legislature, and the
law presumes, that body in the first in
stance passing the act, and the chief
executie in giing it his sanction and
the force and effect of a law by affixing
his signature, hae fully performed
their duty, and gien due considera
tion to such questions and also to the
constitutionality of tbe act
Courts are not to reiew or reise
the ' legislatie action, but to enforce
the legislatie will; and it is only when
they find that the legislature has failed
to keep within its constitutional limits
that they are at liberty to disregard
its action
In regard to the second objection the
opinion, after referring to cases cited,
concludesPersonal I am therefore satisfied that
this act is not subject to the objection,
for the act is clearly a regulatiou in
proportion to duties of the compensa
tion of all township officers within all
counties of this class, and the legisla
ture was not prohibited by the consti
tion from so enacting
The final question for discussion then
will be, Is the act an increase of com
pensation of the township officer after
bis election and during his term of
office The eidence introduced at the
hearing shows that the bills presented
by petitioner to the board of superis
ors for criminal foes during 1903 was,
$950 for month of January, nothing for
month of February, and no bill pre
sented for March So for a period of
tne first three months of his term of
office petitioner only claimed as full
compensation for all serices in crim
inal cases the sum of $950 And coun
sel for respondent contends that I am
to aerage the next three years and
nine months of petitioner's term of
office from these first threo months,

and from lit draw the legal conclusion
that the sum of $35 per month proided
by the act is an increase of compensa
tion, and declare the statute uncon
stitutional and oid In iew of the
rules of construction heretofore set
forth, how can I draw any such con
clusion How can I find tbat Personalthe jus
tice fees for the next nine' months of
the year might not far exceed the Sum
fixed by the statute 
The county goernment act of 1901
under which we are now  acting fixes
the compensation of justices of the
peace in a criminal action at $3 per
day, and in addition allows him for de
positions and transcriptions 15 cents
per folio It can readily be seen how
few cases a justice would need to hae
in a month to bring his fees aboe the
amount fixed as a salary by tbe act
Twele cases that took one day each to
try would be more than the amount
Six cases that took two days each to
try would more ; than equal it Four
cases that took three flays each, or
three that took |four* days each would
exceed it And add to this the fees for
transcription, and the compensation
under the fee system might double the
salary , Under the fee system there is
no limit to the amount he might re
ceie and retain, while in the act under
discussion the sum of $33 is in full com
pensation for all serices of said justice
A reasonable doubt of the constitu
tionality of a statute must be soled in
faor of the legislatie action, and the
act be sustained The constitutionality
of the law must be presumed ••  „
Apply these rules to the aboe facts
and the conclusion is ineitable that
the statute in question does not conflict
with section 9 article 11 of our constitu
tion and is alid and within tbe power
of the legislature to enact Let the
writ issue as prayod for • 
No action has yet been taken toward
appealing the case The district attor
ney has been away for seeral days,
and when he returns the course of ac
tion will probably be decided upon
We refrain from comment, other than
to say, that considering the interests at
stake, and the piece of transparent
special pleading against an appeal con
tained in this week's Amador Record,
we beliee that public interests demand
that a question of such moment be tak
en to the court of last resort for final
settlement '

THE SOUP PLATE
A Seenteenth Century Cookbook
Telia Wlij It Was Inented
A alet of Loiiis XIV published a
cookbook in 1G55 in which be gies as
follows the reason for the inention of
the hollow soup platePersonal
The plates of the guests will be hol
low in order that they may help them
seles to as much soup as they may
want without being obliged to take it
spoonful by spoonful, because of the
risgust they may hae for one another
on seeing the spoon go from the mouth
to the tureen
Guests, it will be seen, used their
own spoons to fill their plates, the large
spoon to be used for sering the soup
not being inented till some time later
Yet een a hundred years after the in
ention of the soup plate (1740) a work
on ciility adised that all the dishes
should be so placed on the table that
eery one could reach them with his
spoon and that If the soup was sered
in a dish (tureen) eery one should
help himself with his own spoon with
out seeming to be in a hurry A work
on manners that appeared Just before
the French reolution deemed It best
to adise its readers that it was impo
lite to pnss the spoon' back and forth
between the mouth and the tureen
A Plea For escriptie Titles
Setting aside the flood not to be
counted as literature, the naming of a
book that is worthy of a name Is a
matter of real moment Two methods
seem to hae been followed— that of
using the name of a leading character,
as "Jane Eyre" and "Rob Roy;" the
other that of giing some hint of the
nature of the book, as in "Vanity Fair"
and "The Cloister and the Hearth"
The first method has no justification
What we plead for is that a title shall
contain the soul or the keynote of the
book Then the author and reader
start on fair terms, i Jane Austen, a
consummate artist, understood this
well, as in "Pride and Prejudice," but
forsook her adantage in "Emma" — a
better book and susceptible to as tell
ing a title It is difficult to estimate
what would hae been the loss to lit
erature if "The Scarlet Letter" had
been labeled "Hester Prynne" and
"The House of Seen Gables"— a tltie
that has worked its way into architec
ture—had been called "The Pyn
cheons"—r Theodore T Hunger in
Bookloers' Magazine
WeiKhtngr a Field of Turnips
The English farmer makes use of
mathematics in his work, says a Lon
don paper Suppose, for example, that
he wishes to know the weight of bis
turnip Crop while It is still in the
ground, which is sometimes a matter
of importance, a simple calculation
will gie him the information
It is the custom in England to plant
turnips in ridges twentyeight inches
apart; this makes ninety ridges to the
acre The farmer selects a row where
the crop seems about the aerage and
pulls up all the turnips in a measured
yard of the row and weighs them
Assuming that they weigh ten
pounds, a simple calculation shows
that the crop aerages a little more
than twentyeight tons to the acre If
they weigh eleen pounds, the aerage
will be about thirtyone tons to the
acre
A Famom Emerald,
The emerald is mentioned by St
John in his Apocalypse An emerald
of inestimable alue ornamented the
bezel of the ring'of Polycrates, king of
Samos That monarch, haing been all
his life faored by fortune, determined
to put his luck to a seere test He
threw the ring into the sea The next
day he went fishing
The record of that day's sport still re
mains unbroken His majesty caught
a fine fish, and in the inside of the fish
he found his ring That happened in
the year 230 of the foundation of Rome,
and the ring, considered as a talisman,
was placed among the royal treasures
of the Temple of Concord
America's Largest Snake
The largest American serpent is the
anaconda, which may attain a length
of thirty feet It Inhabits tropical
America and Is a handsome animal,
with dark round spots scattered oer
Its whole body on a groundwork of
rich brown It is ery fond of water
and haunts the banks of riers, lakes

PAYING TELLERS' ERRORS
Those Officials Are V finally Heady to
Rectify Mistakes
A bank officer, referring in a recent
address to the responsibility of paying
tellers, declares that the idea that such
officials were rarely willing to rectify
mistakes had little basis in fact He
addedPersonal "How is it that there exists in
the minds of many the idea that pay
ing tellers are inclined to resent een
the suggestion that they make errors
in counting money? % I hae neer
known one who made the slightest
claim to infallibility Who has not
heard the ancient and oft told story of
a teller who was asked by a person for
whom he has cashed a check if he had
not made a mistake? As the narratie
usually runs the self satisfied money
counter behind the desk is inclined to
become indignant and replies in a
pompous and abrupt manner that he
neer makes mistakes The consider
ate party then states that the amount
paid him exceeded that named in the
check, but j the teller still maintains
that there can be no error either way,
as he neer makes mistakes 
"Where is the teller who upon being
told he had made an error would fail
to politely inquire as to the nature of
the same? The inference is that tell
ers are possessed of so much anity
and conceit that they lose the amount
said to be oerpaid rather than ac
knowledge an error How; unlikely
and ridiculous!" — New York Post

Personal Yon Lleblg was skillful In correcting
popular delusions en scientific subjects
A notable example of this may be
found In the oerthrow of the once
much discussed theory of "spontane
ous combustion," a comparatiely mod
ern error, dating, it seems, only from
the year 1725, but which persisted long
after Laoisier had explained the real
nature of flre, which was from time to
time put forward with success in the
defense of persons on trial for murder
and receied its last support from
Charles ickens His success in this
direction throws a pleasant light on
the progress of ciilization One won

Yon Liebig had he opposed himself to
such an error in the sixteenth century
when Kepler could only sae his moth

craft by satisfying her judges that she
possessed none of the signs essential
to a witch In those days Kepler did
not dare to say that there were no

Pnrenologry
Phrenology is usually thought to
hae been first expounded by Gall and
Spurzhelm and to be a comparatiely
modern so called "science" But it
can be traced back to the sixteenth
century at least, for in a book pub
lished at that time by "Mayster Jhe
rome of Bruynswicke" is a profile of
a head on which are most distinct
ly marked' phrenological attributes
"Imaginatia" occupies the place now
gien on the charts to "Ideality,"
"fantasia" takes the place of the mod
ern "marelousness," "estimantia" of
"constructleness," while "cogitan
tla" is gien instead of "hope" The
author states that the brain hath cells
or chambers, and each cell contains a
part of the understanding, and that
these parts may be expressly seen in
the figure of the head Phrenologists
can at least disclaim against their
beliefs being newfangled — London

Tipping the hat is a rare thing among
men when there are no women around
A few fine old fellows cherish the habit
of tipping to each other and to stran

ROMAN HOT BATHS
"They May Hae Caused the orn
fall of the Imperial City
When Rome was in her glory and
men were strong and women beauti
ful, they set first importance  upon
the bath There were 800 public baths
in imperial Rome
Before taking a bath the Roman took
a little exercise In the later history
of Rome the room in which he un
dressed was heated, and after undress
ing he was anointed with oil Then
came the scratching and rubbing of
the skin with the strlgil Following
this perspiration was promoted by
heated air or a hot bath The bath
was completed with a cold douche or
cold plunge Finally the body was
anointed again Personal"^i
It Is belieed by many writers that
the Introduction of the hot bath in
the place of the cold bath among the
Romans' was the principal cause of
their downfall The luxury of the hot
bath was weakening and destroyed
that personal alor and hardihood for
which, the Romans were notorious in
their earlier history
 Little by little the enerating influ
ence of the hot bath gradually sapped
away the itality of the Roman soldier
until the more hardy men of the north

Paaslnar of tbe Aristocrats
The Reolution, in giing us a sepa
rate nationality, had not destroyed
time honored traditions Our manners
and customs were English, bred in the
bone; our point of iew that of the
mother country Freedom and equal
ity were political terms that no one
dreamed of applying to social life
What gae position at that time was
inherited distinction Its possession
was free from self consciousness—sim
ply an adantage of birth, which that
Proidence who had always shown an
affinity to hierarchies saw fit to bestow
on a faored class The community
was diided by the grace of God into
gentlemen — and others; perhaps it
would be more exact to say gentlemen,
their serants and others The priacy
of these gentlemen concerned them
seles only There were no "social
happenings" heralded in their newspa
pers to force notoriety upon family life
How It would hae astonished those
early aristocrats if they could hae an

days would attach to their priileges!—

A Work In Which Photographers
Become Remarkably Accnrate
The photographer was about to take
a picture of a young woman "It's so
dark here," he said, "that I guess I'll
gie you about thirty seconds," and,
drawing out the slide and remoing
the cap, he began to count in a meas
ured and mechanical tone, "one, two,
three,, four, fie," ; and so on When
the exposure was finished the sitter
laidPersonal "You gae more than thirty sec
onds to that plate You counted ery
slow— l'm sure it took you a full min
ute to count thirty"
The photographer handed his watch
to the young woman He saidPersonal "I'll
count thirty again Time me" And
he made the count exactly as before
and he was just twentynine seconds
making it "One second off— not so
bad Near my old record, in fact,"
said  the photographer "Ten years
ago, when I made more pictures than
I do today, I could by counting make
exposures up to lie minute's without
being more then a second off Usually
I'd be a second under; but, oer or un

I'd be out of the way But," he added,
