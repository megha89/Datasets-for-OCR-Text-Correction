There were many sly digs and re

THE ELUSIONS OF POLITICS
The delusion ha you can proec
producers from such oppressions by
making laws or by elecing his man
or ha man o office or puing his
poliical pary or ha poliical pary
in power, is a delusion which has long
been mainained by a muliude of

Bu s only a quesion of ime
when hose who are misguided by his
delusion will awaken from heir
dream, and learn ha here is no help
for hem bu o help hemseles and
do hings for hemseles
This grea moemen in he direc
ion of doing hings for hemseles by
cooperaie mehods among producers
from he land is somehing more han
a mere quesion of profi and loss
I is he slow awakening of a slum
bering gian, who is jus beginning o
feel his srengh, and when he has
finally raised himself up o his full
heigh, and rained his mind so ha
I can direc for his own proecion all
he faculies which God has gien him,
he will look back wih surprise and
asonishmen a he days when he
imagined he was bound hand and foo
by he Lilipuians by whom he was
surrounded
WKENING OP THE GINT
nd I Is In he awakening and
raining of his gian — a symbolical
embodimen of he abiliies and ener
gies of he people hemseles, which
is he hope of his naion for he
fuure
You canno oppress a man who
draws he rewards of his oll sraigh
from naure's reasure auls — ges i
from he land iself — land which he
owns — land on which no money lender
holds a morgage — proided, always,
ha ha man has learned o coop
erae wih his fellow men of he same
class, o do for hemseles he hings
which I is beyond he power of he
indiidual man o do for himself — he
hings which require he combined
and cooperaie effor of many men
o accomplish
THE PHILOSOPHY OF RUSKIN
The broad soluion of our social
problems which I am presening o
you conemplaes he creaion of con
diions in his counry under which
we will carry ino pracical effec he
sound philosophy of Ruskin when he
saidPersonal
"Bu since we lie in an epoch of
change and oo, probably, of reolu
ion, and houghs which are no o
be pu aside are in he minds of all
men capable of hough I am obliged
o affirm he one principle which can
and in he end will close all epochs
of reoluion — ha each man shall
possess he ground he can use, and no
more"
I conemplaes as a par of our
public school sysem ha eery boy
should be rained so ha he will know
how o ill he land for a lielihood
I conemplaes ha he rush o he
ciies shall be sopped by he beer
men of all he condiions of rural life
— good roads, nearby neighbors, rural
elephones, ne works of elecric rail
ways, rural free deliery, hickly
seled communiies and owns and
illages in close proximiy o eery
farm home, so ha eery farmer may
enjoy as well as he ciy dweller he
adanages of schools and churches
and libraries and gymnasiums, and
where ar and music may be sudied
for enjoymen in he home as well as
In he ciies
I conemplaes ha whereer he
hing o be done for he benefi of
such a communiy requires he effor
of more han one man, ha hose who
require o hae he hing done for
hem, whaeer i may be, shall com
bine ogeher and do i for hemseles,
proided s wihin reach of he
unied and cooperaie energy and
capial of he aggregaed number of
indiiduals who require o hae he
hing done for hem
In his caegory are creameries,
laundries, rural elephones, associa
ions for he cooperaie purchase of
supplies, associaions for he sale or
disposiion of he producs of he soil,
and many oher associaions which I
migh menion for muual economy,
muual benefi or muual proecion
In secions where irrigaion is
necessary, cooperaie canal sysems
and irrigaion works come wihin his
caegory; and in many pars of he
counry where irrigaion is no now
generally supposed o be necessary,
cooperaie pumping plans migh be
esablished among farmers for he
irrigaion of lands which hey couldin ha way culiae more inen
siely, and obain a much larger yield
and profi per acre han by dry farm

CORPORTIONS SUBJECT TO

is now largely occupied by large cor

If you wan oher illusraions of

Braery, ocor, said my friend he

s you hink i One man Is brae In

fen enough, ha which is called
raery is nohing more han cusom,
ou wouldn' go up on he foreroyal

au? No you! You'd be afraid
"ell, you migh hink me a brae man
ecause I would Bu hen I'd be
[raid o cu a chap's leg off, and you
ouldn'
Tha was wha old Capain Hoskins,
horn I used o sail wih, could neer
idersand If a man was a bi ner
us abou he sea, he used o look
>wn on him as all sors of a coward,
u here came a day when he learned
?er
I happened when I was wih him
a hreemased sailingship, he
rrow We lay a Singapore, along
de Tanjong Pagan wharf, loading
ih a general cargo for Lierpool,
he principal objec in ha cargo was
lion ha we were shipping for
ondon I lay in a srong cage of
ood and iron, wih a door in he
on hrough which i could be fed
was a fine big brue, and eery ime
sreched iself you could see he
uscles slipping oer is sides and he
g, wickedlooking claws peeping ou
he pads of is fee in a way ha
ade you ery hankful for he bars
We had a passenger or wo, one of
horn was a young girl who wen by
le name of Hilda Sandford irecly
c old man se eyes on her rim figure
id her wealh of golden hah, he was
ruck all of a heap, so o speak, and I
mid see ha he was promising him
lf a mighy pleasan oyage
The oher passenger was a srange,
an, wiry man, who wore gold eye
asses, and kep peering abou he
lip In a mos uncomforable way
c gae his name as Professor Hay,
ough we didn' find ou wha he pro
ssed unil laer
n hour or wo before we sared
is Mr Hay came up o he old man
id began asking him a lo of ques
9ns
"Capain," he said nerously, "I hope
c shall hae a quie passage"
"I don' see why we shouldn',"
id Hoskins genially
Mr Hay looked up a he sky
"There seems o be a good deal of
md abou," he said
"Prey fair," said Hoskins "Tha's
ha's going o ake us home No
sing a seamer, we can' do wihou
"You're sure i's quie safe?" asked
ay
"Safe!" says he old man, geing on
s high horse, "safe! I'm sailing his
iip"
The Professor smiled apologeically
fou will excuse me, Capain," he
id, "I did no mean any offence

us on shipboard I is a feeling ha
hae neer been able o oercome"
The "old man" looked a him wih a
ar of goodnaured conemp
"You'e no call o be alarmed," he
lid; "we'll ake you o England safe
lough"
The Professor smiled again and
alked off ino he wais, where we
ad fixed up he lion's cage I
eemed o hae a sor of aracion for
Im, for he sood before i for a leas
quarer of an hour Hoskins looked
fer him, and hen urned o Miss
andford, who was siing near
"Nice sor of chap o hae on a
lip," he said " man like ha ough
) sick o dry land"
"Well, you know, I hae a fellow
¦elinjr for him, Capain," she an
eredPersonal "I'm afraid of he sea myself"
"h," he said, "bu you're a woman,
ou see  bi of fear is all righ in
woman I's naural o hem Bu
ih a man i's differen  man
lgh o be afraid of nohing"
"nd are you no afraid of anyhing,
apain?" she asked
"No I," said Hoskins "You can
ie he bigges sorm eer hached by
le China Sea and I'll hank you for i
Personal brings ou all he good in a man"
"I mus be nice o be so brae,"
le exclaimed
"Oh, i's all righ when you're used
J Sackille Marin
o i," said Hoskins modesly "
brae man and a prey woman are
wo of he fines sighs In creaion
They ough always o be ogeher"
There was somehing in his one ha
made her blush, and hough she agreed
wih him, she ook he firs opporuniy
of clearing off o anoher par of he
deck 
Shorly aferwards we pu o sea
For he nex few days we had he
bes weaher, and eeryhing wen
smoohly I could see one or wo
hings ha se me hinking The
firs was ha he old man was making
himself uncommonly aenie o Miss
Sandford The second was ha Mr
Hay, in a quie and imid sor of way,
was hinking a good deal of her oo
For my par, I hough he girl fancied
Hay raher han Hoskins; and hough
she couldn' aoid he "old man," and
could no help lisening o his sea
yarns, I could see her eyes urning
forwards owards he wais, where
Hay was puing in his ime looking
a he lion
One afernoon he skipper was si
ing Ik dde Miss Sandford on he poop
deck, when Hay came up he com
panion and made his way owards
hem
"There's somehing I wan o ell
you, Capain," he said "I's geing
on my mind and making me quie un
comforable Tha man whose busi
ness s o look afer he lion isn'
doing his work properly The animal
isn' geing enough food I is de
eloping a saage naure nd yeser
day, when I wen o see he man abou
i, I found ha he was inoxicaed
I really hink you should inerfere"
Of course, he "old man" should
hae inerfered Bu he didn' like
being old his duy by he lile Pro
fessor, especially when he girl was
abou, so he jus sneered
"I si  pose you're afraid of he beas
escaping?" he said
"I should cerainly regard i as un
forunae," he lile man replied
"You see, a drunkpn man migh be
careless abou he fasenings I mus
really insis upon your speaking o
him"
"He's no one of my crew," said
Hoskins "I hae enough o do o
look afer hem If any of hem ge
drunk, hey'll hear of i Bu his chap
is a passenger, een if he is only a
seerage one He can do as he likes
wih his spare ime If you're so
darned frighened abou he beas,
you'd beer look o he fasenings
yourself"
"Excuse me," said he Professor
siffly, "ha is no my business The
animal does no belong o me I hae
done wha I beliee o be my duy and
cansay no more"
He urned away wihou een a
glance a he girl
"Tha man," said Hoskins, looking
afer him "is friehened of his own
shadow Le me gie you a bi of
faherly adice, Miss Sandford When
you are looking for a man o marry,
neer selec a coward  girl like you
wans someone who will proec her in
imes of danger; someone she can rely
on and look up o"
"I'm no hinking of geing mar
ried," she said shyly "Bu when I do,
I'll bear your adice in mind, Capain"
"Tha's i," said Hoskins "Think
oer i carefully nd as for geing
married, I'd be glad if you'd hink
oer ha oo"
She sared, wih a frighened look
"Oh, Capain!" she said "Please
don'"
"Miss Sandford!" he said, "Hilda!
haen' you a word for a poor old sea
man who worships he ery ground
you read on? Think oer i None
bu he brae desere he fair, you
know"
"You musn' speak like his," she
exclaimed, rising as hough she were
disressed "You are older han I am
and I don' know ha you are a brae
man I hae only your word for i
Please don' speak o me abou his
again"
The "old man" saw ha he had gone
oo far "Wai!" he said, "don' be
frighened I promise no o say a
word unil we reach England Before
we ge here, if we hae a bi of rough
weuker, I'll show you he sor of
man 1 am I should loe a bi of dan
ger for your sake"
bou a week laer, he girl was
siing on he poopdeck, reading a
book The "old man" was marching
up and down wih a quarerdeck ro,
casing glances a her and hinking
how prey she was, when suddenly lm
uered a howl ha would hae frigh
ened an elephan and sprang ino he
por mizzen riggiri% I was near a
he ime, and I looked a him, wonder
ing wheher he had gone mad Then
I saw wha he had seen, and I wen up
o he sarboard mizzen shrouds as
quickly as he had gone up he por
ones The girl raised her head and
looked up a he Capain and he gaped
down a her and ried o shou Bu
for some ime ie could only make
faces
"Look! look!" he yelled a las,
"come up he rigging!" The lion is
loose!"
She sprang o her fee and looked
abou h°r No four yards away from
her be lion was playing wih a coil
of rope, he errible claws alernaely
exposing and sheahing hemseles
The creaure was paying no sor of
aenion o he girl a he momen,
bu of course i migh ake I Ino Is
head o spring on her a any insan
s she sood, she was cornered be
ween he sern of he ship and he
cabin door There was nohing o be
done bu o climb up he rigging
She ried, bu he firs sep was oo
high, and she could no manage i;
when she realized ha, I hough she
was going o fain
Hoskins was jus going down o
gie her a hand, bu a ha momen
he lion looked up and saw him,
and lashing is ail gae a muffled
roar The "old man" suck where he
was hen, and sor of shiered all oer
like a jelly s for he girl, she moaned
despairingly, and gae herself up for
los Jus hen — ou of he cabin came
Professor Hay
He ook one look around and saw
he lion Then he picked up a broom
ha someone who had been washing
decks had lef leaning agains he
deckhouse, and pushed a he lion
wih i, looking i sraigh beween he
eyes He kep walking forward, push
ing he beas genly before him rign
ino he wais and back ino is cage,
in spie of seeral ugly snarls When
he had i safely fasened in, he came
asern again, looking no he leas bi
excied or worried, and pu he broom
carefully back in is place The girl
was looking hard a him, and her eyes
were shining; bu he didn' seem o
be aware of I Capain Hoskins had
come down he rigging and was look
ing a rifle ashamed of himself He
hadn' known i was so easy o push
lions ino heir cage wih a broom
fer a bi he spoke up
"Tha was a fine bi of work Sir"
he said "If I hadn' seen i, I couldn'
hae belieed i"
"Oh, i's nohing," said he Pro
fessor "I was my business I hae
air^d wild animals"
fer ha he seemed o dismiss he
whole subjec from his mind, and wen
down ino he cabin Bu I saw him,
laer In he eening, alking o ha
girl, and he mus hae had somehing
imporan o say o her, for when he
"old man" me her nex morning and
began making excuses for himself
she cu him shor
"Capain Haskins," she said, "do
you remember adising me o marry
a brae man?"
"I do," said Hoskins, a bi puzzled
"Well," she said sofly, "he asked
me yeserday; and I'm going o ake
your adice"
ll of which shows you, ocor, ha
braery Is ery much a maer of cus

TSK OF THE SCIENTISTS
To cope wih hese pess is one of

abou come o he conclusion ha al
hough s possible o rap, poison

really needed is a conagious disease
ha can be boled up in he labor

Tha here Is some such disease, or
ha one can be produced, he scien

while hey are working wih one dis
ease now ha is faal o a cerain

Some years back he surey los
Jus he chance i has been looking
for Ernes Thompson Seon was p
in Canada, where here was a pes of

disease was carrying hem off, and i
was no long before he counry was

ha his disease migh proe aluable
and managed o cach some sick rab

in New York, bu he problem was no
jus In he biologis's line, and he did
no realize he immense imporance
of i, so he secre was no grasped
Now he biological surey Is looking

There Is a field mouse disease ha
is harmless o domesic animals, and
he surey is rying hard o make i
irulen enough o do business wih
some of he larger pess I promises

wih he rabbi pes Some ime ago
he fores serice se up a howl of in

reseres, and he rabbis ae hem
up in abou a week Then i seeded
seeral hundred acres wih whie pine
o resore he land afer a fire, and
he rabbis cheerfully se o work, dug
up all he seeds and ae hem Bu
he biologiss were loaded for rabbi,
so o speak, and hey furnished he
fores people wih a harmless wash
o soak heir pine nus in before plan

nursery sock which a selfrespecing
rabbi will no more nibble han will
an ordinary human being smell auo

In his he biologiss confessedly

food supplies 'of pine and pinion nus
in he deser for hundreds of years
and hey found ha he rabbis, he

would clean ou heir cache Bu
hey found by experience ha here
was a lile deser weed ha he
ground animals disliked excessiely
and ha anyhing dipped in a ea
seeped from he bark of he weed was
rabbiproof for a long ime hereafer
So he rabbis were checkmaed on

ha hey breed woles quie as fas

In he days of be buffalo on he

ill here was no one where here used
o be a housand Then he cale
men began o sock he ranges, and
he woles found condiions much he
same as in he buffalo days They
promply muliplied and increased ill
hey are now doing an immense
amoun of damage, aided largely by
heir asylum in he fores reseres
The biological surey has sen ou
Mr Vernon Bailey, one of is bes
men, o sudy he wolf problem, and
he has been skeeing and snowshoeing
hrough Wyoming and Monana while
he snow was on he ground and he
woles were paricularly easy o rack

Recenly, howeer, mador as a

THE LEOUX CSE
Couinued from page 1
orney Fairall called as bis Hrsl
winess U Ciarlinghouse of Madera
lie said be knew Mrs Le uiix, and
idenified a newspaper cu, purpor
ing o be a likeness of  N McVicar,
as ha of a man he had seen wih he
defendan a oue ime
The winess was asked if he knew
defendan in 1903, bu disric aor
ney Noron objeced Judge Nuer
inquired wha i was inended o
proe by he winess Fairall replied
ha he expeced o show ha Mrs
Lie mix was he inmae of a bouse of
illfame in 1903, and ha  N Mc
Vicar had induced her o ener such
a place I was ruled ou
r H N Freiman of Suor Creek
saed ha he had reaed he defend
an for illness in July, 1905, and ha
McVicar was here hen He had
gien he deleudan wo ables con
aining a quarer of a grain of mor
phine each, and had insruced her
no o ake hem unless her pain
became unbearable, lie said sho had
inroduced MoVicar o him as "Mr
McVicar" On crossexamiuaicu he
winess was asked if he had no saed
o he disric aorney ha he de
fendan inroduced McVicar as, "Mr
McVicar, my husband" He said
ha he had, bu ha laer in hink
ing oer he maer he had come o
he conclusion ha he defendan
used he words, "Mr McVicar," only
r E Harber as an exper, esifi
ed ha s someimes ery difficul
or impossible o ell by a posmorem
wheher a conusion on a human
body was made slighly before or
shorly afer deah r Souhworh,
he coroner, had saed ha he locaed
he source of he hemorrhage in Mc
Vicar's nose by insering a small elec
ric ligh in he nosril of he deceas
ed r llurbei saed ha he had
ried seeral imes by ha mehod o
discoer he source of nasal hemor
rhages and had failed
r Harber saed ha alcohol had
been discoered o be an anidoe for
carbolic acid; ha if carbolic acid
were slighly dilued by alcohol i
would no burn he mouh or mucous
membrane of he hroa or somach,
bu would cause deah He said he
used carbolic acid, dilued by alcohol,
as an inernal medicine nearly eery
day The winess esified ha fluid
blood in a body seles in he lowes
places, and ha s goerned by he
capillary aracion and graiaion
r George S Harkness esifled
ha if a man were hrown ino a
runk and his head bruised immedi
aely afer deah, i would be praci
cally impossible o deermine by
posmorem examinaion wheher ihe
conusion was made before or jus
afer deah He saed ha black
and blue marks hae been made by
blows upon a body as lae as hree
hours aler deah He saed ha a
corpse would bleed if any essel con
aining blood were opened, and ha
if he body were urned upon is head
and here was a rupure of seme
blood essel in he head a consider
able quaniy of blood would flow
ou
r Harkness saed ha in his
opinion a chemical es of a porion
of he lier, pancreas and somach
wuuld no be a fair basis for an
esimae of he amoun of poison in
he enire body He said ha if he
porion of he lier o be analyzed
for poison were aken soon afer
deah, he bulk of he poison aken
ino he body would probably be
found in he lier He said he ropy,
dark mucous maer found in Mc
Vicar's somach, as esifled o by
chemis Kogers, indicaed ha some
irrian had been aken ino he
somach He said cyanide poison
migh cause such a mucous; he
cyanide odor was no always presen
afer deah in cyanide poisoning
