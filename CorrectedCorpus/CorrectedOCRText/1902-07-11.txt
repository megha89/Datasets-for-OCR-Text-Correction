The Education of the Parrot
To teach a parrot to talk It is neer
fcecessary to place the poor bird in a
darkened room or to stare him Com
mon sense would suggest that he
should be made as happy as possible
in his surroundings Gie him good
food— hemp, maize, oats, biscuit As
a slice of fruit is always beneficial, a
bit of apple, of pear, of banana or of
carrot will do ery well Also see that
your pet has pure drinking water, a
large cage, some soft wood to gnaw,
with plenty of coarse grit on the floor
of tbe cage, for he needs the small
stones to aid hie digestion A parrot in
thse comfortable circumstances may
then be left alone in a room while his
teacher conceals himself in another
The teacher, who should be heard, but
not seen, should repeat, wltb infinite
patience, oer and oer again the word
or words he wishes his pet to learn
The female parrots do not talk— the fe
male of the song birds, it should be re
membered, is not a singer— so that ef
fortE of education in that line are Quite
thron away— Our Animal Friend*
Cicero
Cardinal Newman was a muter in
the art of writing English In one of
hie published letters be expressed the
following 1 opinionPersonal '
- "As to patterns for imitation, the only
master of style I eer had is Cicero I
think I owe a great deal to him and, co
far as I know, to no one else"
Bishop Wordsworth of St Andrews,
another masterly writer of English,
says in his autobiography Personal <
"So far as I hae deried benefit
from any one In the matter of compo
sition it has been from Cicero I do
not underrate tbe adantage of a com
bined study of authors such as Addl
eon, Personal Swift, Bolingbroke, • Johnson,
Burke, Hume, Gibbon, Macaulay and,
I may add, Horace Walpole, but I
must repeat that I beliee I got more
good, not only in writing Latin, but
for writing English, from reading
Cicero and learning him by heart than
from any other source"

RICE WATER NUTRITIOUS
Cartons War Some- British Ofleers
•lscorered This Fact* ;
"It is probable ' that few occidental
cooks who prepare rice in arious
forms for diet are aware that in dis
carding the water in which it is boiled
they are wasting what is regarded- by
the oriental as the most nutritious part
of the food This fact was curiously
proed some years since when a de
tachment of Europeans and > natie
troops in India found th'emselea be
leaguered In a fort with Insufficient ra
tions, een of rice, to enable them to
hold out until a force could march to
their relief
It was when tbe officers wero eerl
ously debating this problem tbat the
naties approached them with what
was regarded &s a curious solution of
the difficulty If, proposed the latter,
the Europeans took all the rice, they,
the naties, would be quite content
with the water in which it was boiled
The suggestion In place of any better,
was adopted, when it- was remarked
tbat while the Europeans found it dif
ficult to maintain their strength on full
rations of rice the naties lost none of
their stamina by seeral weeks' diet on
the water When the proposal was
made, the action of the naties was
praised as one of great deotion to
their superiors, but the sentiment was
somewhat mollified when the disco
ery wa6 made that the naties were
quite aware that the principal nourish
ment lay in the water
Since that time Europeans in tbe ori
ent, following the custom of the na
ties, hae gien rice water to pa
tients, particularly In cases of cholera,
as a last resort when no other food can
be retained in tbe stomach and usually
with good results But the naties al
ways alue this water so highly that it
Is neer thrown awoy
In fact, It would surprise many cooks
to discoer how much may bo done
with this apparently worthless stock
If the rice is cooked In the oriental
fashion— that Js, boiled only so long
that each grain comes out of the pan
separate and not as a sodden mass—
the water wheu strained off and per
mitted to cool will become a jelly ap
proaching the consistency of
mange To suit the occidental 'palate
the water should be flaored with an
extract or otherwise the jelly may
hae rather an insipid taste
Skrcp In Varied Clothing
One of the results of the inestiga
tion of a special committee of the So
ciety of Arts Into tbe question ofbook
bindiuß goes to show that sheepskin
Is often used by bookbinders under
ery different names They found
books bound nominally in Leant mo
rocco, hard graiu morocco, straight,
grain morocco, pigskiu, calfskin, croco
dile aud alligator leathers, all of which
on close microscopic examination were
found to be th ordinary common

skins they were got up to imitate The
committee, ! howeer, were satisfied
that in many cases botb tbe book

Hott Rniiilas Peasants Lie
Most of the Russian peasants pass a
great deal of their lies In workshops,
where they work, eat and sleep, tbe
6ame room sheltering a number and
probably a pig in the bargain There
are few beds Instead, all around the
four walls of the room is fixed what
may be literally described as a bench
It Is made of wood, and at this works
the peasant by day, and on it he sleeps
by night, each man at his own spot
The conditions of the Russian work
shop or factory and the Russian prison
and military barracks, so far as In
terior arrangements are concerned, are

The twentieth century has almost a

The oercheck bears about the same
relation to the horse as the county jail
does to human society  In case of the
trotting horse it seems tbat some de
ice must be used in order to compel
a horse to carry Its head out almost in
a line with its neck, so that the cur
ature of the latter at the throttle will
not cramp the windpipe or shut off
the horse's wind In case of the run
ning horse it naturally extends the
head and neck without artificial aid
This is because^the gallop Is the horse's
natural gate, while the trot is artificial
when it comes to extreme speed
Hence the oercheck is needed" In the
utility horses the checkreln is neer

FRIAY JULY 11, 1902
FOR THE OFFICES
The time is approaching when
county officials— those who hold the
offices in connection with
"the county goernment — will be re
• quired io gie an account of their
• stewardship The soereign people
 who elected them lo positions of
Personal trust will scrutinize the record of
each serant, and if need be call
back the delegated authority, and
place the same in other hands It
can be taken for granted that eery
county official is anxious to succeed
himself It matters not how long a
 man has been in office, he is neer
satiated There is something about
the business of office holding, that
when the aerage man is fairly em
barked therein he is rarely willing
-to let go He becomes fascinated
• with place and power, and too often
~hugs the delusion that the people
are also infatuated^ with him When
_ election time comes round he makes
• the plea that if the dear people
whom he has, from his own interest
ed standpoint, sered so faithfully,
will only gie him one more term,
he will be satisfied, and gie some
other good man a chance But just
as sure as election time rolls round
again, the chronic feer asserts
itself as strong as eer, and he
wants "'one more- term" The
truth is he wants a life-long lease
The loe of power dominates eery
other passion, and absolutely dic
tates the indiidual's life The
longer this appetite is gratified, the
more imperious and domineering it
becomes It is a wise arrangement,
under a republican form of goern
ment, that at stated interals, the
power returns again to the people of
either reelecting their public ser
ants, or relegating them to the
ranks of priate life The con
sciousness of this resere power
tends to exert a salutary influence
upon official conduct It ought to
put the office-holder on his best
behaior When by long-continuance
in public life, or from whateer
cause, this wholesome influence be
comes relaxed, the people may de
pend upon it that a change is de
sirable The time has come when it
is their duty to themseles and to
 their country, to moe for a read
justment of the political machinery
We are not now speaking from a
party standpoint The Ledger is
republican, and its editor is a repub
lican of the stalwart kind We are
not hide-bound in our partisanship
We do not beliee that it is for the
best interests of our county to hae
all the offices filled by republicans
all the time As an indiidual and
as a journalist, we hae sometimes
deemed it our duty to aid in defeat
ing nominees of bur own party
Wheneer we hae pursued this
path of diergence, we hae done so
regretfully, moed mainly by a de
sire for the public weal Selfish
moties may also come into play
Human nature is a curious mixture
of good and bad No man is moed
solely and absolutely by noble in
spirations There is eer present a
strain of clay that interferes more
or less with the ring of the true
metal While this is true as a
psychological fact, it does not de
tract in the least from the alue of
any act the mainspring of which is a
desire for the public weal We must
take human nature as it is, not as
our ideality has pictured it 
We deem it not out of place at this
early period of the campaign, to call
attention to an anomalous feature in"
connection with our county go
ernment The anomaly is probably
matched by no other county in Cali
fornia We refer to the fact that
the entire judiciary and executie
branch of the county goernment is
in the hands of the adherents of one
party — the democrats To be more
explicit, the superior judge, the
'sheriff, the district attorney and the
county clerk are all in the hands of
democrats Let the oters ponder
oer this fact, and the further fact
that when most of these officials
were last elected four years ago, the
county was republican Find if you
can a parallel to this peculiar condi
tion of , affairs in any other county iin
the state We ask the oters to
discuss among themseles the causes
which brought about this anomaly
Let them analyze the political drift
for the past eight years, and they
will probably find that the eil
herein complained of has been
created in a measure by the ery
desire to preent the concentration
of power in the hands of a few of the
same party, or of members of differ
ent political organizations acting in
concert for mutual benefit Hae
we,' in trying to correct one wrong,
conjured up a greater? Ga no sub
ject within the range of our local
goernment are tbe citizens, inde
pendent of their party affiliation, so
jealously alert as the formation; of
goerning cliques, whether, confined
to one or more political organization
They will smite a combination form
ed to perpetuate indiiduals in
power eery time they get a chance
at the ballot box No doubt we
shall hear much about the official
records that hae been made; some
will refuse to see anything that calls
for change- in the situation as \we
hae presented it The oters, how
eer, will, we trust, gie just about
the weight to these t and other state
ments of a more radical character,
that tbey-are en titled to A change
is in order, and it is for the repub
lican party to present a ticket that
will justify citizens in accomplishing
the needed change  -  • 2
Mare it a point to get registered
See that your friends and neighbors
are also registered on't leae it
till the last moment Eery citizen
in Amador county will want to take
a hand in the uomiug election The
man that loses his ote by neglect
will be inclined to kick himself for
his folly ••••'- -
We know not what conditions ex
ist in other state  institutions on
account of Goernor Gage's appoint
ments, but we do know that the
Preston reform school, under super
intendent Reddick runs smoothly
and efficiently, without the slightest
intimation of wrog-doing Under
 H Hirschberg's regime, under
Budd's administration, there were
constant complaints of bad manage
ment and discontent! Since Red
dick has assumed control under
Gage's appointment, the school is
looked upon as one of the best con
ducted institutions of the kind to be
found in the United States
In order to set at rest misleading
reports which are in circulation, we
are authorized to state that Hon
Fred L Stewart will not be a candi
date for either district attorney or
the assembly The assembly dis
trict of which Amador county now
forms the smallest part, was not
constituted as it now stands without
his persistent opposition He op
posed this unjust apportionment in
eery way, and only when his iews
were oerwhelmed in caucus did he
cease opposition; and een then ex
plaiued his position and had the ex
planation spread upon the assembly
journal Mr Stewart will sere the
republican cause if it is so desired,
by taking the nomination for superior
judge, for which office he is emi
nently qualified < In this connection
we are free to say that the editor of
the Ledger has made no special ef
forts to bring about this situation
As a republican we desire that a
suitable candidate be found to con
test for eery office within the peo
ple's gift Let those who want to
hug the idea that some office-holders
of long standing ought to be left in
undisturbed possession of their fat
berths We refuse to acknowledge
any such claim, and beliee that
there is just as good — we might use
a stronger term— material within
the republicau ranks for eery
position now occupied by the tniuor
ity party In common with
other republicans— and only in
concert with them — we hae exerted
ourself to the end that uo office
shall be permitted to go by default
We hae no apologies to make for
this course In years past we hae
refused to sanction the placing on
the republican ticket of a candidate
for superior judge whom we could
not indorse as suitable for the place
But when a man appears who meets
the requirements of the office in
eery respect, we propose to gie
him our cordial support, and earnest
ly recommend him as worthy of the
support of eery republican

be taken as substantially correct They
§how a decline of property alue in the
county as compared with last year of
$60,239 This falling off is In town
ships one, two and three In township
one the reduction is wholly accounted
for in the reduced aluation of the
Oneida mine A year ago the mine
was running 60 stamps, whereas only
40 are kept in motion today, necessi
tating a sweeping reduction In the as
sessment
In township two the falling off is ac
counted for by the transfer of 1000
bead ol cattle to Sacramento county,
that were assessed in this county last
year, and also tbe double assessment of
a mortgage of $10,000 last'yfia

The small illage of Lancba Plana
has been conulsed within tbe past
few week 6by a series of misdoings,
which hae rent the little population
Into two angry faction* The story is
a strange one, and while the facts hae
not drifted far beyond the border
town, they are of sufficient Importance
to demand notice In print Mrs Black

place for nearly twenty years, was In

officials, and gae the story of her
trials' If one tithe of her statement is
true — and we hao no reason to doubt
any part of H— lt shows a state of
society in the hamlet of Lancha which
Is deplorable In the extreme 
 It appears that some "' months ago a
grael claim known as tho Sheridan
mine was started up by hydraulic
power It is a rich claim, and as far
as worked paid well But the law re
quires that no mine can be operated by
hydraulic process without first obtain
ing a permit from the debris commis
sioner Mr Black man spoke to the
operators, Messrs Sheridan and Ad
ams about tbe 'matter in a spirit of
friendliness, soit is claimed The oer
tures were disregarded, and thereupon
Mr B'ackman notified tbe commis
sioners of the fact Shortly thereafter
notices were sent up by the commis
sioners, setting forth what owners of
hydraulic mines "were required to do
before ooinmencing operations' Fie
of these notices were posted up by Mr
Blackmail, and were torn down
Thereafter the commissioners took a
hand in* the - game, -and the hydraulic
operations were stopped, until a permit
could be applied for and granted in
compliance with law There was no
reason why permission could not be
obtained, after some simple precau
tionary measures had been taken The
owners, we understand, hae since se
cured a license to operate, but work
has not yet recommenced
On the 14th of June a social dance
was gien In Lancha Plana The
hotel Is owned by Mrs Blackman but
rented to Mr Ruhl, under restrictions
concerning the salo of intoxicating
liquors On the eening In question,
some of the guests managed to get
liquor and became boisterous and quar
relsome Blackman was seated In front
of the hotel  about ten o'clock, and a
Eersonal encounter occurred between
im and James Crail and Wilson Crail
Blackman was seerely beaten and In
jured He had a small cane in his
hand, and this he used to defend him
self as best he could He has been
confined to his bed eer since He was
In feeble health before the assault, and
was only able to' get around a short
time before this occurred r Marsh
has attended him, and the case was of
such graity that r Adams was also
called in consultation The Cralls
were arrested on a charge of battery
preferred by Mrs Blackman, and were
taken before Justice McCauley, who
held them under bonds of 350 each
The trial was sent for June 28, but at
tbat time Blackman was still unable to
be present, and tbe case was postponed
Indefinitely A charge of using threat
ening language was also preferred
against Wilson Crail, the object being
to hae him bound oer to keep the
peace The matter was heard before
Judge McCauley last week, with the
result that tbe testimony was deemed
Insufficient to hold the accused, and he
was discharged  • rs

added another ictory to his record by
defeating Gus Record", a heayweight,
in three rounds at Jackson Thursday
night • Tremble was at least twenty
pounds lighter than Record The lat

Jackson stated it was the best contest

We take the aboe, headlines and
all, from the Record -Union of Friday
last Those who were present at the
boxing entertainment in Jackson will
smile upon reading such a distorted and
absurd irr ; eidently gien by the

part in tbe affair The fact is the
Tremble-Record affair, was simply to
fill up the time The difference in
weight was in 'faor of Tremble - It
was neer intended for anything more
than an exhibition of skill, and the
local man know, as eery one' else
knew, that he was no match for the
outsider There was no knock-out,

key Eaces, Barrel Races, etc,
and ance at Night
The time-honored fourth of July
was not permitted to pass in Amador
county without some recognition, and
to Jackson must be accorded the honor
of redeeming this holiday of holidays
from utter neglect It would hae ap
peared incongruous to hae celebrated
the 9th of September— the anniersary
of the admission of California into the
Union — with great pomp and cere-
mony, and allowed the day of days
cherished and honored by the Ameri
can people— the nation's birthday— to
hae passed by unhonored by the citi
zens of Amador county

celebration The exercises were con
fined to the afternoon It was ex

L Stewart, who gae a brief, eloquent
and appropriate address, which *as

throughout He spoke of the work of
tho founders of the nation, of the trials
and difficulties that were encountered
In enrolling the United States among
the list of nations, how the country
had grown and prospered The ex
periment of a goernment by and for
the people had proed successful beyond
the utmost dreams of its founders
With increase of area, and commerce,
and population, and influence as a
world power, has come increased re
sponsibility, but the nation would, in
the future as in the past, be found
equal to eery  emergency, and face
eery duty in the spirit of progress and
human rights The oration was well
deliered, and met with frequent ap
plause -Mr Stewart is au easy, tiueot
and •graceful speaker, and eery one
who heard him was impressed with the
coniction ih at he is a man of much
mental force and ability

Killed a Bear
Wilbur Balsley, the fifteen year old
grandson of James Alse, who lies
near Jackson, had a hunting, experi
ence last week that he 'will remember
all his days Balsley is employed by
some cattlemen, who range their stock
during the summer season aboe West
Point, in Calaera l county While out
hunting the stock ho ran across a she
bear with two cubs They were of the
cinnamon species The old bear waxed
hostile at once in the presence of man, Personal
being jealous of the safety of her off
springs Before Balsley had time to
consider what was best to be- done
under the circumstances, -the animal
made for him Fortunately,  Balsley
had his Winchester rifle with him, ; as
the cattle hunters usually 'take that
precaution when roaming oer these
wild mountain ranges Seeing thai
escape was impossible by running, the
young hunter stood his ground, and"
when the brute was within a few feet
of him he gae her the contents of a
cartridge His aim was perfect, and
the boar fell dead at the first shot It
weighed oer 400 pounds' It is need
less to say that Balsley is proud of his
achieement The cubs got away
He is now trying to catch them ' alie
by means of traps

Period of Growth
Children born between September
and February are, some authorities
state, not so tall as those born in the
summer- and spring, months, and the
growth of children is much more rapid
from March Oil August The extremi
ties grow rapidly up to the sixteenth
year, then there ls a slow growth till
the thirtieth year  The legs chiefly
grow between the tenth nnd seen
teenth year 
Comparing the general results, it ap
pears that there are six periods of
growth The first extends up to the
sixth or eighth year and is one of ery
rapid growth; the second period, from
eleen to fourteen years, growth ;Is
slow; tbe third period, from sixteen to
seenteen; the fourth period shows a
slow growth up to the age of thirty for
height, up to fifty for chest girth; the
fifth period ls one of rest, from thirty
to fifty years; tbe sixth period is char
acterized by a decrease In all dimen

bare an uncontrollable tendency to eat
only with the teeth which grow from

teeth more rapidly than those on the
right side of the mouth, and this in
turn gies the upper and lower jaws
an Inclination toward the left
' It ls tbe expressed opinion of many

COFFEE AULTERANTS
The List Rnns Throagh the Alphabet
From A to W
If all of the substances that paE6
through a coffee grinding machine dur
ing the year should be written in al-,
phabetical order, "a" would begin the
list with acorns, and "w" would end it
with wormwood, sprouts of which are
sometimes used to gie the debased
coffee a Blight aromatic bitter taste
Adulteration occurs largely in the
coffee that ls sold in the ground form
Seeral coffeo berry factories hae
been discoered in Europe which wore
doing a large and profitable business
by molding an admixture of tanbark
etoc rust, clay, sawdust, chicory,
coffee sediment and coffee moal into
a neat berry by the aid of some agglu
tlnant, and these berries were so well
made that the deception was not dis
coered for a long time This produc
tion had a large sale among the lower
classes of Rusteia and Poland," nnd
mixed with the genuine coffeo berry,
Its sale was quite liely in otlirr parts
of Europe  •
Unroasted coffee berries are often
made from oat and rye flour and corn
meal The' natural aroma of these
grains is destroyed by Borne process,
and after the proper amount of coffee
aroma ie added the berries are formed
and caused to maintain their shape by
Borne adhesie substance The test
usually employed to discoer this de
ception is to place the beans' in n re
ceptacle containing warm water, which
will dissole them In a few hours—

HAR TO GET STARTE
Things Which 0-rercome a Writer
Whan Beginning an Article
There is a feeling of timidity that
oftentimes oercomes a writer when
beginning an article As In writing- a
letter, it is getting started that puzzles
It is the custom to begin with slow
moing piston and work gradually into
full speed until the flow of words ls
free, and then the difficulty with some
of us is to find the brake ale Again,
a writer sometimes discoers that bis
beginning 1b a more fitting ending, and
ice ersa The newspaper style is to
throw general conclusions up strong
under tbe headlines, while the sermon
ixer reseres them nctll bis final cli
max 
Thackeray remarked once that be
could neer tall exactly what be was
going to say until his pen was in hand
and under motion and then did not fully
realize Just what be was saying until it
was written There is a Bubconscloui
ness that shapes writing as it does
speaking This I know, disturbs some
well known theories of speaking and
writing— as to weighing eerything and
then measuring it out as a druggist
compounds a prescription— but my ob
serations are that tbe preparation is
more in getting full of a subject and
then letting tbe mind work free under
tbe Impulse of the dominating idea
;There are as many ways and meth
ods in writing and speaking as there
are indiiduals, and yet the fundamen
tal law in the transmission of thought
and speech runs largely in the same
grooe, whether it be the Jargon of tho
Hottentot or the polished periods of
the scholar Human nature has itsPersonal
own primitie impulses that defy all
rules of rhetoric and the power of ex
pression—that le, the power, mind you
—is deeper seated than any artificial
formula of stylists — National Maga

Imitating the Mnalo of a Cascade
Certain tribes on tbe Amazon hae
been fascinated by the music of the
waterfall Musical Instruments were
found in use among them consisting of
a complicated mechanism by which
water was poured from ono bowl into
another, in imitation of the cascade,
and then returned by tho receiing
bowl into the essel which had poured
it, co that by a repetition of this mech
anism a constant uiurmur of a cascade
could be kept up bo long as the audi
ence desired or the player was able to
perform it

'Tni for a fried bass," said one

In a few minutes, the two bass on a

the table One bass was larger than

A Sacred Chinese Coin
One of the coins of the Chinese Em

one of the characters that indicate the

transcript In Chinese characters of the
Banskrlt word Arhan, "enerable,"
the name applied to the eighteen at

Buddhism and illustrated this phase
of his faith by haing a set of eighteen

cast into cash This brass is said to
contain a considerable portion of gold;

The Force of Example
When we read the life stories of men
and women, we ourseles participate
to some extent in their own experi
ences Insensibly we place ourseles
in the situations in which they found
themseles, and the problems -which
confronted them seek their solution in
our own brains Their difficulties, their
stumblings, their triumphs, become
personal lessons by which we may
get a wider experience of life than
comes to us in our ordinary aoca
tions, so that when the tinio conies
when we are called upon for some mo
mentous decision or to pursue some
special line of conduct we hae a prec
edent to guide us to the right course—
