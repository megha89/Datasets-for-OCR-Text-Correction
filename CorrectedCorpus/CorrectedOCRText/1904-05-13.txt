SIBERI IN WINTER
RCTIC COL N ICINESS REIGN
FOR FOUR MONTHS
Vladiostok Then Is Frozen Stiff, a
World of Black and eadly Frost
The Way Frozen Food Is isplayed
In the Bazaar— Coast Sledge Racine
Imagine a black world frozen stiff,
and that Is Vladiostok in winter
Whereer water once flowed, In bay
or harbor, a wide, gray white road now
runs, and these are the only two colors
in a wide, still world There are no
trees The large forests of which the
old traelers wrote hae long since
been cut down for fuel, and the im
mediate hills behind the town are all
as bare as a man's hand Once behind
these hills the endless rolling plain be
gins, which is Siberia, says Herbage
Edwards in London Black and White
irectly summer is oer all the
wealth of flowers which for fie short
months hae simply rioted in the land
go black, die out The earth freezes
stiff Winter has come, and black and
stiff the world remains In Vladiostok
there is HtUe snow Sometimes a gray
dust, more like powdered ice than
snow, blows oer the land, but for the
most part it is a black, not a white,
world of frost, and in its way it is
more impressie The earth freezes
deep many feet down and is as hard as
iron The whole harbor turns a kind
of dull gray That, too, is frozen deep
To keep any sort of channel open the
powerful Ice breaker has to go through
its work twice a day Twele hours of
an ordinary winter's day is often suffi
cient to block the passage nd all
this in a town in the same parallel as
Marseilles
To those who hae neer experi
enced it real arctic cold is almost in
conceiable They cannot grasp the
difference between 10 and 50 degrees
of frost It remains to them merely
one of numbers Indeed when once
the winter has gone it Is sometimes
difficult to remember really how cold
It was, but during the four seere win
ter months themseles it Is a ery
solid and  serious fact Eery night
you go to sleep remembering, if you
are new to such things, that a failure
°of the furnace which heats the house
means death You might wake first to
know you were frozen or you might
not In the poorer houses the inhabit
ants sleep on the stoes, and the weak
ones often die runkenness here is
often attended with a swift retribu
tion, which does not in the least pre
ent it, and eery day in win"r people
are taken up frozen from the gutters,
the spirit which is in them only has
tening the freezing, so that the carts
which are always sent round to pick
up the sailors when the crews of the
menofwar are ashore hae to do their
work quickly In the summer time,
when there Is not the same need for
hurry, the men often He about In gut
ters until the afternoon The word
"gutters"ls used simply to designate a
certain part of the roadway Gutters
as such do not exist The drunken
ness among all classes of Russians is
simply appalling Officers think noth
ing of taking a tumblerful of raw
whisky as a modest "bitters" before
dinner X r \
When the wind is not blowing the
cold Is endurable, though fie' fur lined
oercoats are not at all nn extraordi
nary amount of winter wrap You
wear, of course, fur boots, fur gloes,
fur caps Women hae their skirts
and bodices lined with fur Wildcat,
being both soft and ery warm, is of
ten used for this purpose It Is quite
astonishing the partiality for such
things as oily sardines that one deel
ops ,
In the winter time the bazaar Is real
ly a sight Eerything Is frozen stiff
The huge, long sturgeons from the in
terior stand In rows on their ery sharp
pointed noses Baskets full of Ilttie
fishes are plied together like chips of
Ice Frozen birds hang down on long
festoons, and the municipality is spar
ed one trouble— it neer has to make
away with food "gone bad" The
bazaar is almost entirely in the bands
of the Chinese, the tall, dark, rough
Chinese of the north, who lie wrapped
up In wadded cotton clothes until they
look like bundles of bedding Without
the Chinese and the Japanese Vladios
tok would find it hard to exist They
do all the work of the town The
Russians garrison and goern It The
Chinese, the Germans, the Japanese
and the other nations trade in it
The great sport of Vladiostok in the
winter is sledge racing, and when once
jibe harbor Is frozen oer a proper
course Is marked off, and eery one
who owns a horse takes part  Rus
sian horse is a superior brute He
stands as high and looks as strong as
a cart horse, but he goes like the wind,
fie will walk or he will gallop, but he
does not condescend to do anything be
tween His harness Is weird and won
derful and ery Russian, consisting
prlnjarlly of a huge wocden half hoop
jper the head, the keystone of the
jwholo structure, which Is attached to
JnS shafts by winding long, thin straps
jba'ckwnrd and forward It takes hours
to put this on, is always liable to come
undone and If undone Is ery danger
o'Mp n English lady once related to
me whti horror how she was taken
7or a drie in Vladiostok and the
hQrse and carriage Just went oer e

"cafh<s i the way It is quite true, a
'Husslaii horse does, and if you hae
ohod drien behind one you are neer
gfitfolia again You are either killed
I In Vladiostok you take your daily

'most exciting thing to do Is to sledge

THE 'WIN'S MYSTERY
Mountain and Valley BrceiH and
How They Originate
The meteorologist is gradually di
esting the wind of Its mystery and is
able to explain conincingly how and
when It originates The study of a
great number of obserations taken si
multaneously all oer the country and,
in fact, all oer two continents has en
abled the expert to foresee Just when
wind and storm will arrie at certain
sections of the country
Of course the physical topography ol
any neighborhood lias Its Influence on
the local storms, fogs and preailing
winds The "mountain" and "alley
breezes" that are so eagerly sought
during the summer recreation or so
journ is an instance of the effect ol
mountains on local climate and weath
er conditions s explained by a pro
fessor of meteorology; because of ac
tie radiation at night the layers 6l
air near the earth become cooled, and
as cool air Is heaier than warm air,
a law of physics that Is generally ap
preciated theoretically, but usually
oerlooked practically, this heay ail
tends to moe down the hillside The
tendency becomes after a time suffi
ciently pronounced to produce a gen
eral downhill moement, eentually re
sulting In a perceptible breeze
That is what is commonly designated
locally as "the mountain breeze", and
which, from its origin Is practically in
one constant direction, though the in
terention of powerful storms may
temporarily reerse the customary
moement Vice ersa, during the day
the presence of warmer and therefore
lighter air near the earth causes a
moement of the atmosphere with an
upward tendency, creating the so call
ed alley breezes In certain faora
bly situated localities the appearance
of the mountain or the alley breeze
Is as regular as clockwork, the transi
tional period being marked by a calm

BEVERS IN MONTN
The Rare nimal Is Very Tame
Where He Is Not Hnntril
The beaer is not shy where he is not
hunted and acquires confidence in a
friendly watcher sooner than any oth
er animal 1 know Strangers or unusu
al clothes on a person to whom they
hae become nccustomed alarm thorn,
though, like dogs, they can apparently
Identify an acquaintance by scent
The beaer's sense of sineil is ery
acute, for he is able to scent a man
200 yards away, and liis eyesight is
also most keen, but be seems to be dull
of hearing when at work, and I hae
often walked to within a few feet of
one while he was cutting wood How
eer, their method of warning each
other of danger Is by slapping or
"smothering" the water with the long,
flat tail which is so characteristic a
feature of the animal and which not
only helps him in swimming, but is
used for carrying mud If a large ani
mal appears at a place where beaers
want to work or feed the latter will
often "smother" the water continually,
one after another Joining in, till the In
truder Is scared away I hae had a
thorough wetting at night while watch
ing a pond through the splashing made
by this trick
I saw my first beaers in the Mussel
shell rier in Montana t first they
died wheneer they became aware of
my presence, but after about three
months they paid no attention when
they scented me, and in six months
they would swim around or cut bushes
within a few feet of me In fact, they
repeatedly stole my fishing poles cut
from green willows until I teamed to

"OYSTER FRMS
The Katnral and rtificial Beda la
Eastern Virginia
 ; In eastern Tlrglnla there are seeral
thousand acres of oyster farms where
oysters are raised by artificial methods
on artificial beds The natural oyster
i bed Is where the oyster breeds and
matures naturally There are thou
sands of acres of such beds ln the
! Chesapeake b»y system of salt water
In such beds the oysters breed by the
millions, and as they are too close to
gether there they cannot all reach a
satisfactory growth If taken  when
small from  these natural beds and
strewn along on the bottoms where
there are no oysters naturally, at the
rate of 000 to 1,000 bushels per acre,
; such young oysters mature and ripen
off for the market, some ln one and
the rest in two years
There Is a profit ln such work when
intelligently managed of 25 to 33% pei
cent Probably more than 100,000 acres
of artificial oyster bed? are made to
grow an oyster crop ln addition to the
acreage embraced ln the natural beds
The area of artificial beds Is Increas
ing rapidly each year
One singular feature about the oys
ter Is thisPersonal They all look exactly alike,
there being no difference between the
male and the female externally or In
ternally In fact, the art of man is not
sufficient to distinguish one sex from
another nother unique feature Is
thisPersonal The male oyster 'lays" as many
eggs as the female— "equal rights" we
perceie The eggs of the r|ale are
called milt, and the eggs of the fe
male are called spawn n ordinary
full grown oyster is supposed to lay a
million eggs a year In spawning sea
son the water is full of these eggs,
and when the milt and the spawn
come in contact and the water is at the
right temperature life is Imparted to
the microscopic egg, and it drops to
the bottom, where If it succeeds in
grasping hold of something, such as
another oyster or shell or rock or any
thing to hang on to, the tiny creature
begins to form its shell and in a few
weeks becomes isible to the eye—

The nimal While Busy Will Neer
Injure a Person
"n elephant neer injures a person
when it is busy," says an animal train
er with a big circus "It may sound
strange, but there is not a case on rec
ord of one getting ugly when it was
performing or working The reason, I
think, is that the elephant Is an animal
of one Idea— that is, It can think of
only one thing at a time '
"When you put an elephant at work
it gies its whole attention to Its task
Great power of concentration? No,
just inability to think of two things at
once When It gets busy it takes a lot
to distract Its attention, and it neer
stops to think about a priate grie
ance If we start a horse or a dog do
Ing a trick we can't leae it for a min
ute or it will loaf or stop work alto
gether, but it is different with an ele
phant Once get it started, either alone
or with others, and It will go through
with Its turn without another word
It is absorbed ln its work
"That same trait, I take it Is what
makes an elephant such a icious ani
mal when It gets ugly It can think of
nothing but what has made It angry,
and it will not stop until it has torn
something to pieces Oh, yes, an ele
phant can carry a grudge It neer for
gets an Injury, and it waits Its chance
to get een, but when It is busy it for
gets the tricks that hae, been played
on it It is only when it has nothing
to do that It gets to brooding oer its
troubles Human, eh? Well, I hae
known folk with that sort of disposi
tion"
Leap Year Proposals
The origin of the peculiar woman's
right of leap year is said to date back
to the fifth century St Bridget, so the
story goes, was troubled because the
women under her charge insisted on
their right of proposing to the men
ccordingly she went to St Patrick
and begged him to settle the matter by
fixing certain seasons In which women
might take the Initiatie St Patrick
promised them eery seenth year, but
then, pleased by the persuasie elo
quence of St Bridget, he said they
should hae the longest year in the
calendar, and that was eery fourth
year, when February had an extra day
So long
* With respect to the origin of the fa
miliar parting salute, "So long,'' there
Is a suggestion that it is deried from
the Norwegian "Saa laenge," a com
mon form of farewell, equialent in
meaning to "au reolr," nnd pronounc
ed like "so long," with the "g" soften
ed There was a fair number of Nor
wegians among the settlers in meri

likely the phrase was picked up from
them It is In general use among tfe

ORIGIN OF PLUM UFF"
Hair a Famous ish of English Sail
or* Got Its Nam*
There are many traditions respecting
the origin of the name "plum duff,"
the great holiday dish of sailors No
feast on shipboard is considered per
fect without it ccording to the story
gien ln the history of the British
nay, an English brig in the south Pa
cific was caught ln a series of awful
hurricanes ll on board were anxious
to reach a port in time for Christmas,
but the holiday found them still off the
Naigator islands Worst of all, they
bad shipped a sea that carried away
the hencoop containing a few chickens
When the cook saw the Christmas
dinner floating ln the lee scuppers and
ln danger of going oerboard he made
a gallant charge down the slippery,
sloping deck to recoer It, but at that
moment a great wae rose high oer
the bulwarks, broke with ' resistless
fury on the ery spot where he stood,
and when it subsided cook and chick
ens bad both disappeared
This unfortunate accident left the
crew not only without a Christmas
dinner, but without any one to pre
pare an ordinary meal The sailors
were heartily sick of "hard tack" and
remembered with longing the famous
plum pudding of merry England They
determined that somehow they must
hae a Christmas pudding and drew
lots as to who should be the cook I
The choice fell on the boatswain's
mate, a brawny son of the Emerald
Isle In the galley he found an old
cookbook This be solemnly pored
oer ln search of something promis
ing, but for lack of skill or materials
found, nothing he dared enture upon
t last he settled upon a recipe which
began, "Make a stiff dough" When
he reached the word dough he said to
himself, "If rough spells ruff,
dough spells duff"  s ,' \
So he made the pudding, putting ln
some fine Malaga raisins, and sered
it out with a generous quantity of rich
sauce The sailors hailed It with de
light and appreciation "What d'ye
call it?" they asked "Plum duff,"
said the proud cook nd plum duff
it bas remained from that day to this

 farmer tells of an old Irishman in
his employ whom he once permitted to
make use of certain land for farming
purposes on condition that Pat should
gie him onefourth of the crop he
raised t the haresting of the crop
the farmer was amazed to find the
Irishman had not kept his part of the
agreement, 'for while he hauled away
three wagon loads of produce he had
not sent a single load to his master's
barn The farmer called Pat's atten
tion to the fact that he had taken the
entire crop, askingPersonal "Now, how!s that, J
Pat? Wasn't I to receie a fourth of
the crop?" "You was, sir; you was,"
excitedly exclaimed the Irishman, "but
there's only three loads, sir; only three
loads"

POLITICL RROGNCE
 noticeable feature deeloped in
the initial stages of the presidential
campaign is the readiness with which
the subordinate bodies of both po
litical parties hae entered into the
business of instructing delegates 
few years back it would hae been
looked upon as a serious breach of
trust for any state or county com
mittee to attempt to lay down in
structions for a nominating conen
tion  political committee has
really nothing to do with shaping
the iews of the rank and file of the
party Tt is supposed to represent
and follow the ideas of the majority
It is nothing short of arrogance for
a few men, selected merely to set
the party machinery in motion and
to look after material matters, to
tell the party as a whole what course
it ought to pursue Such an abuse
of authority tends to contention and
dissension It cannot hae a bene
ficial effect, but on the contrary is
calculated to needlessly stir up
strife nd yet this spirit of in
structiou has deeloped to an alarm
ing extent this year Both state
committees led the way in this direc
tion, and the cue has been taken up
by the local committees all oer the
state with an aidity neer before
manifested This shows the force of
a bad example, and exemplifies how
careful official bodies ought to be in
not oerstepping the bounds of their
authority The state has been, and
is being deluged this year with a
flood of instructions coering ques
tions upon which the party alone in
conention assembled has the right
to speak with authority It may be
safely assumed that wheneer an
official transcends his authority the
act is prompted by a wrongful mo
tie In political bodies usurpation
of power is usually caused by boss
ism — the desire of some man to con
stitute himself the supreme ruler of
the party Our sister county of
Calaeras has distinguished itself in
the ariety and wide scope of in
structions indulged in by a political
committee  report of the pro
ceeding of the republican county
committee is before us It appoint
ed nine delegates to the state con
ention, and more than one half the
appointees are members of the com
mittee fter this modest exercise
of official power it proceeded to
"resolute" on national, state and
district questions, recommending a
candidate for president, congress
man and assemblyman One state
official seems to hae been studiously
oerlooked, namely, State Senator
W C Ralston This omission is all
the more noticeable froth the fact
that the senator was a resident of
that county when elected, while
ssemblyman McKenney, who is a
resident of mador county, comes
in for a full share of compliment by
the committee To cap the climax,
the following resolution winds up
the platform and resolutions sent
forth by this committeePersonal
Resoled, That as the first con
gressional district is essentially a
miningdistrict, we beliee that this
interest is entitled to full recogni
tion, and we therefore instruct our
delegates to the district conention
to use all honorable means to secure
representatie mining men as dele
gates to the national meeting at
Chicago
The meaning of this is plain
Both delegates to the national con
ention from this congressional dis
trict should be taken from the min
ing districts This is a slap at
Humboldt county, for presuming to
hae a candidate for national dele
gate in the field, in the person of
Hon J C Bull Humboldt, with
its 2000 republican majority, placed
in the first district mainly for the
purpose of making it a republican
district, is thus told by a clique
of chronic place hunters that she has
no right to recognition in the selec
tion of delegates to the national con
ention What particular role a
delegate from either the mining or
agricultural section can play in the
nomination of a presidential candi
date does not appear The truth is,
two candidates from the mining coun
ties are aspiring for the honor of
representing the first district at the
Chicago conention, and one from
Humboldt The Calaeras county
committee urges the district conen
tion to throw the Humboldt man
oerboard, because mining interests
are paramount in this district We
know not how the expression "our
delegates" will be appreciated by
our party friends in our sister coun
ty Such a claim of ownership is
hardly consistent with harmony in
any political organization We hope
the icious adice to monopolize the
delegation to the national conen
tion will not be heeded The ten
dency is to create sectional strife in
this congressional district — to array
one interest against" another The
interests of the party must not be
imperilled at the bidding of design
ing politicians

 Bhort Trip
On Friday of last week we left ma
dor City for a business trip through
the rytown, Plymouth, and Oleta
sections, and were surprised at the gen
eral appearance of the natural scenery,
the thrifty growth of grass and crops,
and the bright outlook' for a reason
able compensation for all energies and
time expended in eery shade of Indus
try The roads were in fairly good
condition, and being seated behind
spirited horse, iewing eerything, as
we passed, it seemed but a few minutes
when we reached rytown
rytown feels the effects of the
FremontGoer strike, for many of the
working men often spent their een
ings lounging around the business
houses, and spending their money in
her channels of trade Notwithstand
ing the temporary setback she still
presents a thrifty appearance, and the
business men ail seem to be prospering
The town hall has been remodelled,
and its neat and cleanly appearance will
attract the attention of passersby * for
months to come
Florence Giann'ni runs the hotel and
butcher shop, and we know of no hotel
in the county where one can get a
better meal for 25c
 Me Wayne conducts a general 
merchandise store, with George ;C'
Jennings as clerk Mr Me Wayne also
owns one of the best stock farms In
the county He considers it useless^ to
take his stock to the mountains this
year, as it will be impossible for them
to consume the heay growth of grass
on the home place
Exsuperisor Le Mbin is the illage
blacksmith, and his shop is crowded
with work the greater portion of the
time He has taught his people, that
it pays to patronize a home institution
by turning them out first class work at
reasonable prices The town supports
two saloons, that seem to be doing well,
and are run In a quiet, orderly manner
Plymouth is one of the substantial
towns of the county Not what she
was in bustle and noise during the days
of the Empire and Pacific, but a good
solid business town, made so by being
the center of trade for one of  the best
farming portions of the state— the
Shenandoah alley Plymouth could
gain much by the opening up of a few
of her many mining prospects, but she
can lose nothing by their remaining
idle She has a solid backing that can
neer grow weaker, but all the time is
growing stronger She has four gen
eral merchandise stores, two of which
carry upwards of a $30,000 stock each,
three first class hotels, a splendid
meat market, two blacksmith shops,
two barber shops, two undertaking
parlors, four saloons, a drug store, a
harness shop, and a liery stable
There are two resident physicians, and
two teachers are employed In the pub
lic school It Is claimed that more
farming Implements are sold in Ply
mouth than in any other two towns in
the county The Bar State and Shen
andoah mines are about three miles
distant, but their trade helps the town
Taking eerything into consideration,
her future Is ery promising
Oleta — Here It was where many of
the immigrants first began to search
for gold, and here It was where many
of them made and lost fortunes To
day but little prospecting is being done,
although it is the opinion of many that
millions of the precious metal still re
mains buried beneath the surface
Oleta is peopled with enterprising men
and women, as shown by the erection
of one of the most substantial and com
modious I O O F halls in mador
county Both the subordinate and
Rebekahs hae a large membership,
and not once during our stay did Personal we

STRIKE SITUTION T FRE
MONT
Men Failed to go to Work on Mon
day, and the Trouble is Still On
t the close of last week it was
understood that the strike at the Fre
mont mine near rytown was settled,
and that the men would resume work
Monday morning When the time
came the men were on hand, but it was
soon eident that company and em
ployes wore not agreed The miners
demanded that all those who had quit
should be taken back Superintendent
Goodall was not prepared to do this,
een if he were willing The air com
pressor was undergoing repairs, and it
was impracticable to employ the full
working force Besides he was not in
clined to bind himself to reemploy all
who had been discharged The men
thereupon refused to go to work, and
the strike was declared to be still on
It is reported that the union sanc
tioned the strike, and the demands
hae been enlarged to include an in
crease of 25 cents per day in the wages
of underground men, and also recogni
tion of tbe union
On Tuesday tbe superintendent sent
an ultimatum to the men that their de
mands could not be granted; that the
company would run the mine on the
same basis as heretofore; that the
right to employ and discharge men
could neither be surrendered nor
abridged ; that the mine would be dosed
down rather than surrender
If the strike continues for any length
of time, it will proe a serious backset
to that section of tbe county Tbe
Fremont Company is not in a position
to stand additional expense in trying
to run the property under strike con
ditions The principal owners are well
todo They are independent of the
mine Indeed, the mine so far has
proed a sinkhole for capital It has
gien no adequate return on the capital
inested Just as it is getting into
good working shape, with deelopment
work in progress looking to the in
crease of the milling capacity this labor
trouble comes along, throwing a dark
shadow oer the whole raining indus
try
There was rock enough on the dump
to run the 0 stamp mill for seeral
weeks The strike has le<l to the quit
ting of some of the surface men, and
a reduction of the stamps in operation
to one half Wednesday night the mill
was closed down The rock being low
grade it would hardly justify to keep
the mill going with less than the full
complement of stamps
This morning tbe situation was un
changed The mill came to a standstill
on account of the exhaustion of the ore
on hand The union held a protracted
session Wednesday night, but the out
come has not been learned, the men
being pledged to secresy One picket
is employed to watch in the interest of
the strikers, and two extra watchman
are employed by tbe company at night
 report is current that tbe strike is
apt to extend to other mines, but on
this point we hae failed to secure any
thing definite The assayer at tbe Fre
mont is away on a acation of two
weeks No serious damage would re
sult to the underground workings by a
stoppage of seeral weeks Howeer,
a prolonged shutdown Is hardly prob
able Mr Goodall would much prefer
to operate with mador county men,
but if labor cannot bo had here, on ac
count of union influences, an effort will
doubtless be made to secure it else
where It is safe to say the Fremont
will be run by those who hae their
money inested therein, or it will re
main idle Outside of labor union cir
cles public opinion is oerwhelmingly
on the side of the company It is the
same fundamental issue tbat was re
cently raised in tho threatened street
car strike in San Francisco— tbe right
of the employer to conduct his business

Last Sunday afternoon the demo

meets next Monday in Santa Cruz
Owing to the delay in calling the offi

question to select representaties by a
conention or primary election It
was determined to appoint outright
The following were elected delegatesPersonal
 Caminetti, at large; Township 1,

Township 2, J  Perkins; Township

The bitterness of tho Hearst or antir

feeling was thoro, but it wag not called
into action by any resolution of pledg

candidate They are unpledged, and
are probably diided in their presi

THE RILRO
PROPOSITION
The railroad is coming, and coming
soon, if all signs of the times do not
fail The people of mador county
are ready, and hae been ready for
years to welcome its arrial It mat
ters but little to us what route it
takes, what town it touches first,
w hether it be single or double track,
broad or narrow gauge, whether pro
pelled by steam or electricity, or who
furnishes the money and brains to get
it through just so it gets here, and gets
here in time to handle the immense
amount of freight that will be used in
the mining belt during the coming win
ter season It does not stand to reason
that men who put their money into an
enterprise of this kind can cater to the
wish of one man or a dozen men They
must look first to their own interests,
and where those interests conflict with
indiidual Interests the latter must be
dropped and the former adopted If
by selecting a route that would bring
the road from lone to Jackson and
then on to mador City, the company
found they could get better results than
by running from lone to mador and
thence on to Jackson, let them adopt
the first route and reject " the last
But if on the other band the latter
proposition should seem tho most
feasible to the company, then build the
road oer that route, and reap the
largest reward possible for the money
expended What we want is the road,
and we want it right away Wbat dif
ference if we reach home 15 minutes
before or 15 minutes after the people
from Sutter and mador If we are
the last to arrie we can een things
up the next trip by getting 15 minutes
the start of our neighbors Let us
quit bickering oer routes and try to
get the road
Much sympathy is now being extend
ed to the poor teamsters, most of whom
hae been playing a losing game eer
since they made their first trip, and the
question is being asked, What will they
do with their teams? Can anyone
point out an instance where a railroad
passed through a new country that it
dii not open up new enterprises that
required the use of two horses and men
where but one bad been used before
What became of the negro* when Whit
ney inented the cotton gin? Many
entured the assertion that he would
hae to be exterminated, but no, he
was put to cultiating large areas of
the soil, the production of cotton in
creased, and today the south is one of
the most prosperous sections on the
fase of the globe Slaes wore in
greater demand than eer, and just so
will horses be after we get the railroad
The parties now proposing to build
the road are all business men, and hae
gone to work in a businesslike manner
They first ascertained the amount of
business that they could reasonably
depend upon, put eerything, down in
black and white, and by liberal calcula
tions decided that it would be a safe
and paying inestment fter secur
ing substantial financial backings, such
as the California State Bank of Sacra
mento, they, proceed to incorporate,
specified tho route as nearly as it was
possible to do so at that time, estimated
the cost at so much per mile, and
actually paid in, in cash, to treasurer
J J Fagan ten percent of the subscrib
ed capital They hae asked for the
franchise tp run through the county,
and the superisors hae done their
duty by ordering it sold to the highest
bidder on the 6th day of June, which
is in accordance with the state law It
is not presumed that any other com
pany will endeaor to outbid the pro
moters of the present schemo, for it
would only necessitate a delay in se
curing another  large force of men
are in the field making sureys, get
ting distances, estimating grades, and
figuring on probable costs s soon as
the franchise is definitely secured
rights of way will be asked for, and if
obtained without difficulty the directors
and financiers will be called together,
the route selected, the final surey
made, contracts for grading let, and
the work will actually begin and be
pushed to an early completion The
state law requires that fie miles be in
operation within one year after the
franchise is securedi but this company
does not hesitate to say that the entire
road will be in operation in less time
We trust that no unforseen difficulty
will arise to retard the early completion
of the road mador county is far be
hind her neighboring  counties in this
matter, and as there can be no doubt
about it being a paying proposition we
see no further cause for delay

WNTF FOE TRIN BOB
BERY N MURER
George Gates is Suspected of being Im
plicated in ' the Shasta County Train
HoldUp
This community was much exercised
last Saturday on the arrial of the San
Francisco papers stating that George
Gates — with a criminal record against
him in this county — was suspicioned of
being the prime moer in the holdup
of the Southern Pacific train at Cop
ley, in Shasta county, on the 31st of
March, at which timo the express mes
senger, W J O'Neil, was shot and i
stantly killed It is claimed that three
men are concerned in this crime —
namely George Gates and Vernon Gates,
his brother, aged 27 and 21 respectie
ly, and a Mexican named James rnet
of Modoc county The Gates boys
were brought up in Jackson The
family lied for many years at Ken
nedy flat, where thy father was owner
of the sulphurels tailings plant in con
nection with the Kennedy mine George
is the oldest child He was wanted by
the officers here for a daring robbery
committed on the 11th of pril, 1902,
at the saloon of ndrew Piccardo, on
the Jackson Gate road t a late hour
he appeared at that resort, with a rude
mask oer his face, and at the point, of
a pistol stiHTti Tap seeral men that hap
pened to be there, and demanded that
the iron safe should be opened He
gathered up some loose money from
the till and the men, but did not get
tbe contents of the safe When about
to leae, young Piccardo seized a shot
gun and tired at the desperado as he
was making his exit from the premises
He was badly wounilei] in the hip, and
it is now known that ho stayed in Sut
ter Creek for seeral days thereafter
to recoer from his injuries sufficiently
to trael  day or two after he left
the county by way of Middle Bar, it
became known that he was inoled,
and probably the sole perpetrator of
this crime The officers started on his
trail, but be succeeded in getting out
of the state
Six months after this plunge into a
career of crime, four men attempted to
hold up a Colorado train at a place
called Bishoar Junction One of the
robbers was killed, and the suriors
failed in their entorpriso George Gates
is credited with being one of the men
implicated in that work' Since that
adenture Gates is said to hae oper
ated at arious points between San
Francisco and Seattle His brother
Vernon is thought to hae joined him
in the path of crime within the last six
months The bandits wro last seen
in Southern Oregon, traeling toward
Portland The offloers expect to effect
their capture in a short timo" George
is a man of nere, and desperate He
is likely to put up a stilt fight before
he is captured
Potter's Petition
 few weeks ago a petition was pre
sented to the board of superisors ask
ing for an increase in price for licenses
granted to a certain class of peddlers
When printed it road as though the
idea originated with H E Potter of
Plymouth, and has been christened
"Potter's petition" Mr Potter signed
the petition after many others had
signed, but had nothing whateer to
do with getting it up, or originating
the idea He signed merely to assist
in safeguarding the business which he
represents

NOTES FROM
GOL MINES
el Monte— t the meeting of the
directors held last week an assessment
of 5 cents per share was leied The
main fissure encountered by the big
tunnel has not been followed to any ex
tent yet The quartz ein is two feet
thick, and prospects well in free gold
ssays indicate a alue of from Sl3 to
oer $20 to the ton The fissure is
fully six feet between walls, and the
whole is heaily mineralized The
mill was kept running a portion of last
month on rock from the upper tunnel,
the amount realized being in the neigh
borhood of $700, not including sulphur
ets, of which there is between 2 and 3
tons on hand
Telegraph Hill— lt is reported
that rich grael has been encountered
at this mine and in paying quantity
We hope the report is true, as the
company has worked faithfully, and
paid their men promptly mador
county needs just such men to deelop
her resources Mr Eaton has been
superintendent since operations first
began
Madrone— This mine is in the Pio
neer district, about fie miles from the
town of Volcano, and two miles from
the efender mine It is now being
operated by C S Leslie & Co Mr
Leslie is an experienced miner from
Tuolumne county, and haing heard of
the excellent opportunities for men of
limited means to deelop mines in this
section, determined to risk a few dol
lars and a little labor in' ascertaining
whether or not these stories were true
He has been here about 18 months, and
now has control of seeral good pros
pects He takes particular pride in the
Madrone, and is working it upon a
common sense, • businesslike plan
Three tunnels hae been run,' fie, six,
and eight hundred feet respectiely
Each tunnel encounters the ledge about
300 feet below the surface, so that the
ledge is now exposed for 00 feet
Each man is now getting out about one
ton of pay rock per day 8 tons were
milled last year, which yielded $2660
per ton Between 90 and 100 tons are
now on the dump, being of a much
richer grade than that already milled
 100ton test will soon be worked, and
Mr Leslie estimates it at $0 per ton
Tbe $7 and $10 rock is laid to one side
until a mill can be erected upon tho
property When asked how long tbe
mine could supply a 10stamp mill, Mr
Leslie answered, continuously Kim
ball & Sons own three properties ad
joining tbe Madrone, of which we will
speak in another issue

The Famona Fight Between Chief
Carpenter and Price
"The methods of fighting duels among
the Indians," said an old frontiersman,
"were aried, each tribe haing its own
peculiar custom Some of the tribes
learned to fight according to the code
of the white man, howeer, among
these the Choctaws or Cherokees,
which reminds me of the famous duel
in July of 1883, when the celebrated
Choctaw chief, Carpenter, fought near
the Pine Creek Indian agency with a
white man named Price Chief Car
penter was a splendid type of Indian,
tall and straight and comely, and he
had been well educated and had natu
ral talents and natural instincts that
put him head and shoulders oer bis
Indian associates
"s usual, this trouble was started
by a disagreement oer some triial
matter, which caused a dispute and
ended in the white man calling his
red brother a liar Throughout the
trouble the big Indian had remained
perfectly calm, although considerably
angered, and as the insult fell he gazed
coldly into the eyes of Price and saidPersonal
" 'Your blood shall wash out that
word'
" 'Wheneer you're ready, say tho
word,' cried Price 'You can do your
washing right here and now if you
please'
" 'Not now, sir, but tomorrow morn
Ing, when the sun peeps oer the top
of that wild plum tree, you must be
here and without fail*
"The report of the duel spread far
and wide, and at an hour considerably
before sunrise a large crowd had gath
ered on the dueling ground to witness
the encounter Price was the first on
the field, and for a time it looked as if
there would be no Carpenter But,
true to his Indian blood, the chief dis
dained coming too soon at the appoint
ed place as much as he would hae
feared coming too late, and it was just
as the first rays of the sun stole oer
the soft green of the tree that the red
man stood in place Not a word was
spoken by either man Both drew their
pistols, and, raising the weapons, they
fired almost simultaneously Carpen
ter reeled, but with a mighty effort
checked a tendency to spin round, and,
staggering, fired as the crack of his op
ponent's pistol sounded for the second
time This time Price jumped high in
the air and landed on his face stone
dead
"With a wild shout the crowd press
ed forward to surround the lucky chief,
but before aid could reach him he fell
senseless Price had been shot through
~th<T heart, clean as a whistle, a remark
able shot considering the condition of
the Indian when be made it, and a
shot Carpenter could hae made xs
the first place without a doubt had he
been as determined to kill as Price
proed himself when his bullet burled
itself in the Indian's breast"

The Pomp With Which It Was one
by Queen Victoria
The trumpets sound! The queen ap
proaches! The trumpet continues, and
first enter at a side door close at my
elbow the college of heralds richly
dressed, slowly, two and two Then
the great officers of the household, then
the lord chancellor bearing purse, seal
and speech of the queen, with the mace
bearers before him Then Lord Lans
downe with the crown, the Earl of Zet
land with tlie cap of maintenance and
the uke of Wellington with the sword
of state Then Prince lbert,  leading
the queen, followed by the uchess of
Sutherland, mistress of the robes, and
the Marchioness of ouro, daughter
inlaw of the uke of Wellington, who
is one of tlie ladles in waiting The
queen and prince sit down, while eery
body else remains standing The queen
then says in a oice most clear and
sweet, "My lords, (rolling the r), be
seated" Upon which the peers sit
down, except those who enter with the
queen, who group themseles about
the throne in the most picturesque
manner The queen had a crown of
diamonds, with splendid necklace and
stomacher of the same The uchess
of Sutherland close by her side with
her ducal coronet of diamonds and a
little back Lady ouro, also with her
coronet On the right of the throne
stood the lord chancellor, with scarlet
robe and flowing wig, ' holding the
speech, surrounded by the emblems of
his office; a little farther, one step lower
down, Lord Lansdowne, holding the
crown on a crimson elet cushion,
and on the left the uke of Wellington,
brandishing the sword of state in the
air, with tlie Earl of Zetland by his
side The queen's train of royal purple,
or, rather, deep crimson, was borne
by many train bearers The whole
scene seemed to me like a dream or a
ision fter a few minutes the lord
chancellor came forward and presented
the speech to the queen She read it
sitting and most exquisitely Her oice
is flutelike and her whole emphasis de
cided and intelligent Very soon after
the speech is finished she leaes the

 COOL OFFICER
Be Faced an ngry London Mob and
Got Fair Play
uring the reform riots in Hyde
park, London, In 1866 the mob on a
well remembered night began tearing
down the fences of Hydepnrk for fires
and barricades Colonel Thomas Went
worth Htgginson tells In the tlantic
Monthly of an English officer who was
dining with a friend, all unconscious
of the impending danger Presently
he receied a summons from the wai
department, telling him that his regi
ment was ordered out to deal with the
mob
He hastened back to his own house,
but when be called for bis horse he
found that his serant had receied
permission to go out for the eening
and had the key of the stable in his
pocket The officer hastily donned his
uniform and then had to proceed on
foot to the guards' armory, which lay
on the other side of Hyde park Walk
ing hastily in that direction, he came
out unexpectedly at the ery headquar
ters of the mob, where they were al
ready piling up the fences
His uniform was recognized, and an
gry shouts arose It must hae seemed
for the moment to the mob that the
Lord had deliered their worst enemy
into their hands
There was but one thing to be done
He made his way straight toward the
center of action and called to a man
who was mounted on the pile and was
eidently the leader of the tumultPersonal
"I say, my good man, my regiment
has been called out by her majesty's
orders Will you gie me a band oer
this pile?'
The man hesitated a minute and then
Bald, with decisionPersonal "Boys, the gentle
man is right He is doing his duty,
and we hae no quarrel with him Lend
a hand, and help him oer" ; j
This was promptly done, with entire
respect and the officer in brilliant uni
form went hastily on bis way amid
three cheers from the mob Then the
mob returned to its work, to complete
it if possible before he whom they aid
ed should come back at the head of his
regiment and perhaps order them to be
shot down ; ;
POKER CHIPS
There are more than four "knaes"
to the pack in some games 'i* 
In big hands, as with big guns, you
want to look out for the recoil ; Personal
/ The moral motto, "eal as you would
be dealt by," Is classed as the "joker"
in a poker pack
It is awfully bad form, you know, to
let the loss of a few chips make you
look as cross as If you thought you
were getting the double one
• It may be good adice to "bet your
hand for all it's worth," but it is a
mighty dangerous thing to bet it for
all or more than you are worth

to cut the cards Our experience teach

at the same time the only safe one is

men was besieged in a tower Refus
ing to surrender," they fought until all
but eight of them were killed On
these eight— traelers' wonders must
creep in — it was found impossible to in
flict any wound "Now, this was by
irtue of certain stones which they had
in their amis, inserted between the
skin and the llesli nd the charm and
irtue of these stones were such that
those who wore them could neer per
ish by steel" They were therefore
beaten to death with clubs

On board an ocean steamship a gen
tleman wished to help a lady who was

"Why, you see, ma'am," quoth he,
"it's just one thing goes up and then
another thing comes down, and then
they let the smoke on which makes the
wheels go round That's what they
call the hydraulic principle It's quite
simple when you kuow It"

THROWN UPON THE STGE
The Way English udiences Reward
Popular Players With Gifts
There hae lately in the proinces
been seeral sensational nights at
prominent theaters whfu to mark the
last performance of a local pantomime
ali manner of gifts hae been thrown
upon the stage for the benefit of popu
lar performers
H those acquainted for long with
the Inner life of the theatrical profes
sion can tell some remarkable' stories
of these gifts cast upon the stage The
most celebrated and uniersal of these
relates to a lady who once held the
main portion of the lease of a promi
nent London theater While this lady
 was still an  actress only and not a
manageress, an actress of great talent
and beauty, there was one night on the
first production of the piece a small
bouquet cast upon the stage at her
feet ttached to the bouquet was a
small Russia leather card case, and in
side this were bank notes to the alue
of £1,000 exactly On no fewer than
seen different occasions, with a toler
ably long interal between, did the
same thing occur, and the lady, as al
leged, has neer from that day to this
discoered who her admirer was,
though all manner of romantic conjec
tures were made at the time
Een within the last few weeks an
unknown elderly gentleman threw an
enelope weighted with pennies and
containing a fie pound note to a tiny
child performing in a London subur
ban pantomime Some theaters hae
been celebrated for their gift nights,
all manner of presents, from frying
pans to green egetables, haing been
gently deposited on the stage for the
popular actors; yet, on the other band,
both writs and summonses hae been
handed to actors who could not be ap
proached through the stage door; but
who consented to receie presents oer
the footlights on/their benefit nights
The most curious sight the writer
eer saw in connection with these gift
throwing, nights was in relation to a
faorite actor who, at a great proin
cial theater, played during a long pan
tomimic run the part of a parasite
named Cadgi, who carried a pipe
that had a huge bowl and whose oft
repeated cry was, "Can any one oblige
me with a bit o' 'baeca?" On the last
night of the performance the familiar
request for/a "bit o' 'bacca" had no
sooner beenjspoken than literally scores
of packets, 'and "screws" of tobacco of
eery imaginable kind were thrown
upon the stage, more than 120 of these
falling about the actor— London Tit

"Good little wifey," he replied
"What is it?"

thoughtful?"
"Splendid!" he exclaimed
"nd now I wish you'd bring me
home some more money tonight"
"What did you do with what I

some surprise
"Oh, that's what I saed the smoking

"Now, honestly," snid the unbelieer,
"hae you eer been'helped by prayer?
Can you point to a single instance in
which you can truthfully say that
