"AH well — all happy — lots

report from the monkey cage
of Barnum's Circus eer since
the keepers began dosing the
monkeys with Scott's Emul-

eery year and the circus had
to buy new ones
One day a keeper accident-

Emulsion near the monkey
cage and the monkeys eagerly
lapped it up from the floor
This suggested the idea that it
might do them good Since
then the monkeys hae receied

HIS NOSE WAS SAFE
But His Neres Were In a State of
Cold Chill Collapse
"I was sitting on the eranda of a
far western hotel one afternoon," said
the Boston drummer, "and was lazily
smoking one of the nicest meerschaum
pipes you eer saw when out of the
tall of my eye I saw that a natie down
at the other end of the eranda had his
gun sighted at me They were a wild
lot around there, and I couldn't tell
whether he meant to shoot me or the
pipe The chances were In faor of the
pipe, howeer, and It seemed a good
chance to test my nere I made up
my mind to let him shoot and to pre
tend a careless air, but I'm telling you

the sweat came out at eery pore and
my heart pounded my ribs sore I felt
a sort of tick at the bowl of the pipe,
heard the "crack of the gun and knew
that the bullet had passed through the
pipe I got a brace with my hands and
feet and waited for a second bullet,
and it went through the bowl after the
first I sat there until his fourth bul
let had hit the pipe and knocked the
bowl off the stem, and then the shooter
sauntered up to me and laughingly

NIAN PRAIRIE OG HUNTS
The Little Animals Are eemed a
ainty ish by the Narnjoen
The Naajo Indian, while he cannot
be preailed upon to eat a rabbit, 1b
greedily fond of fat prairie dogs Large
communities of these small animals
abound ou the western plains, and the
Naajo has resorted to many ingenious
methods for trapping his coeted dain
ty One of them is by the aid of a bit
of mirror placed at the entrance to a
burrow When the animal entures
from his bedroom, deep under ground,
he sees a familiar Image mocking him
at the front door, and he hurries out to
confront the Impudent intruder, when
Jie is pinned to the ground with an ar
row
But the most effectie method is
what the Indians call the rain hunt As
soon as the steady downpour of sum
mer rains begin eery Naajo who can
walk repairs to the prairie dog illage
with hoes, sharp sticks or any digging
Implement With these they hollow
out trenches that will lead the storm
water into as many burrows as possi
ble Soon a little stream is pouring
down each small home, and the inmate,
much disturbed, pops out to see what
the matter can be Many of the ani
mals remain under ground until they
are drowned, and their bodies float to
the surface
After such a bunt In which many
pounds of prairie dogs are generally
secured, there Is a feast for many days

The Time For Planting Bulbs
There Is no definite rule to be laid
down as to the length of time in which
bulbs should be left In cold storage
As a general thing, top growth will not
begin until root growth is completed
This nearly always takes from six
weeks to two months It Is therefore
generally safe to begin bringing Octo
ber planted bulbs to the liing room In
ecember Those desired for later
flowering can be left in cold storage,
where they will remain dormant as to
top growth By bringing bulbs to light
and warmth at Interals of a week or
ten days we secure a succession of
bloom which makes It possible for us to
brighten our windows with their beau
tiful flowers during the greater part of
winter— New Lippincott

The Easy Steward and the Anda
clons "Grafter"
A man walked Into one of the up
town college clubs one morning aud sat
down in the smoking room  His air of
assurance was hardly in accord with
his tattered clothes It was early, and
none of the members was alout Ho
rang the bell, and the steward re
sponded
"It seems good to get back into the
club again," he remarked"
"Yes, sir," said the steward
"I used' to be a member hero, but I'e
had hard luck and can't afford It any
longer"
"Yes, sir; I'm sorry, sir" said tho
steward
"By the way, I'm a little short of car
fare this morning," said tho nery
stranger "Could you let me hae ten
cents until I call here again?" 
The surprised steward reached Into
his pocket and handed out a dime
"Thank you," said the man   "Now,
I'm also a little hungry, haing bad no
breakfast o you suppose you could
gather me up a little luncheon?"
The steward was stupefied by such a
display of nere
"And a little whisky with a dash of
bitters would not go badly with the
food"
The steward fled as one ot the mem
bers entered The stranger saw the
new arrial and rose hastily
"I am too parly for my friend" he
said as he walked toward the door
"I will return later" Then he added
In an undertone, which the doorboy
heardPersonal "Too bad, too bad!  That stew
ard was ensy He'd gien me the club

The Terrapin isease
The terrapin Is thought to hae much
influence in causing sickness, and the
terrapin disease is either a rheumatic
aflliction about the chest and ribs or
possibly some pulmonary trouble The
association of the terrapin with diseases
in this portion of the body doubtless
originates from the fact that the ribs
of the terrapin are not free, as In the
case of most of the higher animals, but
are united Into one piece
i An Indian who was 111 applied for re
lief to a shaman and was asked, "id
you not when a boy tie strings to the
terrapin's tail and worry the creature V"
The patient admitted that he did
"Well," said the medicine man, "that
Is what is the matter It Is the terra
pin's turn now, and the terrapin is pay
ing off old scores You hae the terra
pin sickness, and all your ribs hae
grown together and to your breast
bone"
The shaman administered the proper
remedy prescribed In such cases— l for
get what it was— and the man thought
he was cured

A FISHING FICTION
THE "MAGIC EYE" OF THE SAULT
STE MARIE INIANS
An Old Guide's Explanation of the
Inillan Whlteflsh Hunter's Method
of Getting Ills Glistening Catch
Prom Under the Rapids
"The first time I fished in the Sault
Pie Marie rapids," said a well known
Lake Keuka sportsman "I landed in
an hour twenty-one brook trout that
weighed forty-fle pounds; so I was
ready and willing to beliee anything
I heard or read about the possibilities
of those waters or the astounding
things that men who fished In them
weii' able to do
"Consequently I belieed what they
told me about the marelous feats the
Indian fishermen of the Sault Ste
Marie could perform In the way of
setting wbltefish Few who hae tour
ed the great lakes hae not heard of
those same feats, witnessed them and,
of course, could do nothing but go
away belieing that they were 11 they
seemed to be
' "Particularly will they marel, as I
did, at the Indian whlteflsh fisherman's
magic eye with which he seems to
look down through ten feet or more of
foaming, rushing water and see white
fish that to the white man's eye would
be Inisible fie inches beneath the
surface It would hae been strange
if I had not mareled at It, haing
witnessed more than once manifesta
tions of its alleged power That was
before I talked with old Guide Gnrron
'The astounding feats of the Indian
whiteflsh netters of the Sault Etc
Marie that the guidebooks and the
hotel keepers and steamboatmen Insist
on telling tourists about are performed
by two Indians In a canoe One occu
pies the stern and manipulates the
paddle to keep the canoe's bead point
ed up stream The Indian In the bow,
standing upright, uses'a pole to aid in
propelling the canoe or in keeping it
steady
"Lying ready to his hand is a dip net
four feet In diameter, fastened to the
end of a pole perhaps fifteen feet long
The fishing I done at the foot of tho
rapids, where the water bolls and tum
bles furiously With his pole the In
dian In the bow keeps the boat moing
about In the rapids and gazes constant
ly Into the water, which Is often teu
feet or more deep i\ , ;
-^"Suddenly the Indian In the bow will
seize the net handle 'with one hand,
neer ceasing to manipulate the canoe
with his pole in the other nor for an
instant remoing his staring gaze from
the water The net is not more than
in his hand before he has plunged it
perhaps teu feet distant from the boat,
thrusting It at the same instant to the
bottom Then be gies it a peculiar
twist, draws it up and, surrendering
the care of the canoe for the moment
to the Indian with the paddle, he
draws the net up, neer without from
three to half a dozen glistening white
fish In It frequently weighing fie
pounds each
"The wondering spectator, seeing
nothing but the boiling water, the sud
den start of the Indian and his quick
and dexterous plunging and drawing
up of the net with its inariable load
of whitefish, can do nothing but ac
knowledge to himself the necromancy,
of the Indian's piscatorial art I know
that I did, and for two seasons gae
myself away to the fascination of that
mysterious fishing Then one day I
mareled at It greatly to Guide Garron
the shrewd and cunning old French
man who knows eery rock and eddy
and whirlpool of the rapids and all the
wiles and tricks-'that any other guide
knows and a whole lot that no other
one does know, and Garron's little
black eyes twinkled
" 'Ah!' he chuckled 'Zat mageeck
bye He yon gr-r-rand homboagl* >
"Then he explained in his oluble
find picturesque patois the apparent
mystery of the Indian whiteflsh fisher
man's magic eye Whitefish are natu
ral denizens of the still, silent wate-i
of the great lakes To get from Lake
Huron, to Lake Superior these 'fish
must fight their way up the fierce and
stubborn Sault Ste Marie rapids  In
doing this they trael by easy stages
They can brae the rapids but a short
distance at a time, when, almost ex
hausted, they drop Into the shelter, of
the friendly rocks that pile the bottom
of the rapids
"Huddled sometimes by the score be
hind these rocks, getting wind, as '*
were, to oercome another stage jof
their Journey, the whlteflsh, if the wa
ter is not too deep, can be lifted out
by the hand of the fisherman, they are
so nearly exhausted The Indians, as
well as the white fishermen know, this
and, knowing well the location of these,
sheltering rocks, hae only to thrust
their nets dowu behind them and draw
them up filled with fish
"The cunning of the Indian led blm
long ago to gie isitors the impression
that he could penetrate the troubled
depths of the rapids with his gaze and
discoer the whitefish ou the bottom
The wonder of It spread, aud It has
been one of the fondest and best pay
ing fictions of 'Susan Mary,' as the na
ties gie you the pronunciation of the
Sault Ste Marie"— New York Times

THE WAY OF A TORNAO
One That Was Remarkable Both In
Appearance and Action
"A tornado that was remarkable both
In appearanoe and In action was one
that traeled from Texas across Okla
homa and Indian Territory In May,
18IXV says Bart W Mayo In Alnslee's
"A man in Sherman, Okla, wbo had ex
ceptional opportunities for obsering
the storm, inasmuch as he was caught
up In It and carried seeral hundred
yards before descending to earth again,
is certain that It was not funnel
shaped He says of ItPersonal
" It looked to me like a great ball of
apor rolling oer and oer toward
me When I first saw it distinctly, It
was at a hill perhaps an eighth of a
mile away It seemed to be about 250
yards wide and 100 feet high The mo
tion was that of a ball rolling oer and
oer, not spiral, and it came on rather
Blowly, perhaps thirty miles an hour
Whateer the ball of cloud struck was
lifted right off the ground
" 'I saw It pick up house after house
between the hill and me, and the cloud
seemed to be full of flying boards and
timbers When the ball reached Mrs
C's, the house nearest me, It went
straight up oS its foundations The
house remained intact until It was
about twenty or twenty-flo feet from
the ground, then it burst open and the
fragments flew in all directions It
looked like an exploding bomb The
corn and cotton standing a hundred
feet on either side of the storm's path
were uninjured, but wheneer the
cloud struck the higher ground It
spread out, coering a wider strip of
the surface
" 'When the cloud struck me, I went
up lightly and easily and the sensation
was not unpleasant, bnt I came down
hard and was badly shaken up, al
though not seriously Injured On the
highway north of Sherman fence wires
were torn from the posts and pounded
into the hard surface of the road a dis
tance of two or three Inches' "
THE WOMAN WHO FAINTE
A Lesson on Courtesy In a Crowded
London Theater
Here is an example of the courtesy
and good feeling of the twentieth cen
tury How are we to account for it?
The worst of it is that In such a case
the Innocent suffer for the guilty When
a woman does really faint there will
be some hesitation before she receies
a seat consolation and brandy '
In an oercrowded pit of one of the
London theaters the other night a lady,
who was standing, suddenly became
ery faint, and another lady sitting
near kindly offered her her seat Not
only this, but, seeing that she did not
recoer quickly, she went and fetched
some restoraties from the refreshment
room, whereupon the lady quickly re
coered and began to thoroughly enter
Into the spirit of the play, apparently
quite obliious of her benefactress
As time went on she was asked by
her benefactress If she would object to
her sitting down again But the other,
would none of It "Now I hae a seat
I mean to keep itl" she replied Where
upon her benefactress gently reminded
her that she had paid for her seat and
thought that she had eery right to re
turn to It But no amount of talking
would apparently moe the former
A gentleman sitting near, haing
watched the episode, leaned forward
and said, "o you Intend to gie up
your seat?" "No," was the reply Up
he sprang and gently lifted her out of
it An onlooker said to a lady next to
her, "I like that man" "Thank you,"
was the reply; "he Is my husband"
There seems to be no limit to the re
sources used by some people to secure
what they hae not paid for The lady,
was no more faint than any one else In
the audience— London Free Lance
The Necessity of Bait
Although in treaties on dietetics salt
figures as a condiment, it is uniersally
recognized to be something more; in
deed It Is an indispensable element of
the food of man and animals A well
known authority asserts, says The
Medical Press and Circular, that when
eer the annual consumption of salt
falls below twenty pounds per head of
population the public health is likely
to suffer The depriation of salt does
not produce a definite disease, but re
duces the itality of the organism as a
whole, so that the ictims of adminis
tratie measures which restrict the
consumption of salt -more readily fall

tle Influence
The atmosphere plays its part In geo
logical operations Its corroding pow
er, backed by rain and wind, helps to
decay and disintegrate those rocks
which ore exposed to its influence Rain
completes the work thus begun Wind
blows dust, sand and olcanic ashes
oer large tracts of earth— in fact,
oer the whole of it
It is only of late years that geolo
gists hae discoered that fine ol
canic dust is carried oer the whole of
the earth's surface and plays a ery
Important part in the deep sea depos
its On deserts and nearly rainless re
gions blown sand will wear away the
hardest rocks by beating against
them Some sandstone formations ap
pear to hae been piled up by winds
Winds cause ocean currents, waes
and storms The great denuding
power of the sea is largely due to the
atmosphere Some parts of  the Eng
lish coasts are being rapidly washed
away Plants and animals hae their
distribution considerably affected by
winds and ocean currents Again,
whether liing in water or on land,
animals lie on the oxygen supplied
from the atmosphere, and land plants
absorb carbonic acid from the same
source •     
Rain acts in two waysPersonal (1) chemic
ally by dissoling certain substances,
such as lime, out of the rocks, and (2)
mechanically by wearing down their
surfaces as it flows oer them Any
old building— a ruined castle or cathe
dral, for instance— shows a "weath
ered" surface resulting from the ac
tion of rain and wind In sandstone
structures the details of caring are
often lost, and on old tombstones the
lettering can hardly be deciphered
Springs are due to rainwater collecting
in rocks and rising to the surface
Riers are fed by rains and springs
A rier is a ery powerful geological
agent In the hardest rocks riers
gradually care out a alley or gorge
This is accomplished partly by chemic
ally dissoling certain mineral sub
stances, but chiefly by mechanical
erosion; the stones, sand and mud
wearing away the bed of a stream as
they run and tumble oer it
The finest examples of rier action
are the famous canyons of Colorado,
which in some places are gorges 5,000
or een 6,000 feet deep, with ertical
sides But as already pointed out
riers hae a constructie action quite
as important as their destructie ac
tion Bj bringing down their burden
of sediment Into lakes, estuaries and
seas they build up great piles bit rock
and "sow the dust of continents to
be" *
Glaciers are riers of Ice fed by the
"eternal snows" of high mountain
ranges such as the Alps They wear
out their own alleys as riers do;
they transport mud, sand and stones to
great distances, In some cases sending
them scaled up in Icebergs to float far
out to sea and on melting deposit their
burdens on the sea floor Off the coast
of Newfoundland northern icebergs
are depositing a great mass of "gla
cial drift"
The sea Is a great denuding agent;
but its work is more constructie than
destructie It Is the workshop where
nearly all the stratified rocks hae
been accumulated and ranged In layers
or strata The riers and ocean cur
rents continually bring in fresh sup
plies of debris een for hundreds of
miles   
Man, compared with the lower ani
mals, produces but little effect as a ge
ological agent Still the human race
has considerably modified the distribu
tion of plants by cutting down forests
and by cultiating certain*- plants to
supply food So with animals Cer
tain useful pecles hae been cultiat
ed and enormously Increased at the
expense of others which proe useless
or harmful  '  Personal 
But plants and animals hae, had,
and still hae, far more Influence geo
logically Coal seams are made up of
egetable remain's of former ' periods
Forests hae an Important influence
on climate and on animal as well aa
plant life , In the comparatiely un

plants doubtless hae important func

Coral reefs afford the most familiar

The force known as heat Is of great
Importance The earth is hotter below
the surface and probably has a "ery
high temperature toward Its center
I oouiu places nut ery far below its
surface It contains highly heated rock,
which occasionally flows oer the sur
face during olcanic eruptions In
other places we find hot springs in con
nection with olcanic action
Heat exercises a powerful Influence
on rocks deeply burled below the
earth's surface, chiefly by means of
heated water and steam In this way
rocks hae been ery much altered
or "metamorphosed" The crystalline
schists hae thus been brought to their

changes due to heat and there is no

When the young seals are well grown,
they suddenly disappear with their

knows where they go, and their return
is equally as sudden as their departure
The bulls are the first to put in an ap

they fight until they die In the mean

A CORRECTION
Our attention has been called to an
error in our article last week touch
ing the fees for legal serices in the
school tax case We stated that
while the case was started Septem
ber, 1899, and decided in the superior
court in October following, it was
not until February, 1901, that the
board of superisors, upon the writ
ten request of the respondent, C
L Culbert, county auditor, ratified
the employment of W J McGee as
9pedW counsel to attend to the case
in the supreme court, the matter
being then on appeal before that tri
bunal This latter date' should hae
been February, 1900 We are free
to admit that this apparently triial
error changes the situation mater
ially As the first bill for legal ser
ices, amounting to $250, was al
lowed in April, 1900, it will be seen
that this claim was presented after
 — and not before, as our article
stated — Jhecase was appealed Mr
McGee says the serices rendered by
him and associate counsel in the
higher court up to that time, and
included in the first bill, consisted
in a motion to dismiss the appeal on
some technical ground, which mo
tion was denied To this extent,
therefore, we are willing to modify
our article of last week
- When the second bill of $500 was
presented, the superisors found
themseles in a dilemma, not of their
•own creation, but a legacy bequea ted
to them by the slipshod methods
adopted by their predecessors on the
board A difference of opinion arose
as to the scope of the first bill
The total of $750 seemed a large
?um for legal fees in a simple man
damus suit It appears so to us,
• and we hae no doubt the majority
of our readers will iew it in that
light also This $500 claim lacked
the approal of the district attor
ney; it was also minus his disap
proal They were therefore left to
their own discretion An examina
tion of the records failed to elucidate
the matter in the least The minutes
told the simple fact that four month's
after the commencement of the ac
 tion the superisors ratified the em
ployment of special counsel There
,was absolutely nothing to show what
the amount of his fee should be in
the eent of the case being won or
the' case being lost Is it surpris
ing that misunderstanding should
result from Such a loose way of do
ing things , A contract inoling
the payment of money by the coun
ty should not only be in writing, but
be definite as to the amount There
was no reason why it could not hae
been made so in this case When
the last bill for $500, therefore,
came before them  for action, the
superisors' were "up against lit"
Without anything to guide them ex
cept indiidual memories of a discus
sion of two years ago, the super
isors had to face the ' issue squarely
by either allowing the bill, or reject
ing it and thereby assume the re
sponsibility of a lawsuit against the
county for its collection fjnder
these circumstances the superisors
probably took the wisest course by
allowing the bill • If the fee is
regarded as heaier than would hae
been the case had a more careful
policy been adopted at the outset,
the blame must fall upon those who
failed to fix the terms of employment
on a definite and certain basis
We might notice another peculiar
feature of this litigation The two
fees paid by the superisors foot up
about twele per cent of the total
amount inoled in the suit But
this is not all The suit was to set
tle a dispute between two branches
of the local goernment So that
each side was backed by public
money It has been stated that the
school trustees in employing attor
neys to represent their side of the
controersy agreed to pay them
$1500 if they won the case, and a
small fee— slso it is said — if they
lost In one respect, therefore, the
school fathers were wiser than the
county fathers— they did fix the fee
schedule definitely, and also od an
exceedingly liberal scale proided
the battle terminated in their faor
So that if the trustees won, the fees
and expenses on both sides would
hae agregated about $2000, or
nearly one-third of the sum inoled
We cannot assume that the suit was
started with any risk financially on
the part of those who started it
The county treasury— the school
funds on the one side, and the cur
rent expense fund on theother— must
bear the burden of both the winning
and the losing side Let us hope we
hae seen the last for a long time of
the disastrous game of playing one
fund against theother, with the tax
payers in the comical role of footing
all the bills
THE ROA QUESTION
A petition is pending before the
board of_superisors for the opening
up of a new public road to proide
an outlet for the timber and other
resources in the neighborhood of the
Amador Lumber Company's mill in
the eastern • section of the county
The company is willing to bear a
large proportion of the cost of con
structing this thoroughfare! and ap
peals to the county to furnish the
rest Curiously, this ery reason
able appeal has raised a great hue
and cry in opposition It is de
nounced as an unheard-of proposi
tion; as unjust, because it proposes
to use the public money to promote
the business interests of a corpora
tion; that this corporation is coYn
posed of wealthy indiiduals who are
well able to bear the entire expense;
that from the early days of Amador
county the lumber aien hae been
compelled to shoulder the entire bur
den of road making to get their
product to market, and therefore
the same policy should be continued
indefinitely
It seems to us that all these posi
tions are untenable, and inapplicable
to the conditions existing in this
county to-day We are not sufficient
ly acquainted with the conditions ex
isting in the country through which
the proposed new road must pass,
and hence we are not prepared to say
whether or not the circumstances
warrant the county in shouldering
the expense of seeral miles of ad
ditional roadway But we hae no
hesitation in saying that if this road
is necessary to the deelopment of
the lumber industry in a heaily
timbered country, and that the im
proed transportation facilities to
be thus created will alone enable
our local lumber men to compete
with outsiders for the trade of the
mineral belt, the assistance asked
is but a small matter compared with
the adantages to be gained
It is the business of the county to
proide roads The county cannot
injustice, either in whole or in part,
shift that duty upon priate parties
To say that a few priate persons or
a corporation will be benefitted by
thenew road is not a solid objection
The same might be said of eery new
road that has eer been opened at
public expense Indeed, that is the
ery object of road building— that
priate or corporate enterprises may
be encouraged, and indiiduals bene
fitted In proportion as this result
is secured the county is also bene
fitted by the increase of taxable
wealth And that is the only way
in which the county, as a county,
can receie benefit from roads As
an abstract proposition, a county as
such has no use for roads The only
use it can make" of them is to keep
them in repair; and this is done for
indiidual conenience and profit
It makes no difference so far as
the principle is concerned whether
the indiiduals be few or many; in
their aggregate capacity they are
termed the public/ •
To reert to the experience of early
days is not in order Then the local
millmen monopolized the local mar
ket To bring lumber from the out
side was out of the question The
profits of the business might then
justify the sawmill owners in making
roads at their own expense They
had to do this or lose the trade, for
the county was too poor in taxable
property to build the highways re
quired In those piping times' of
priate road building the county was
a network of tollroads Eery few
miles the traeler would run up
against a toll gate These are
times to be remembered, but not to
be patterned after
One point more It is said that
the stockholders of the lumber com
pany seeking this new outlet, are
wealthy, and able to bear the entire
cost Admitting this to be true,
what of it? They pay taxes accord
ing to the alue of their taxable
property If they hae more than
others, they are called upon to pay
more, not only for roads but for all
other purposes of goernment To
force them to bear, in order to do
business in our midst, additional
burdens not contemplated by law is
a system of oppression under which
no community can hope to thrie '
We repeat, we are not adocating
the granting of the lumber com
pany's request, because we are cot
sufficiently acquainted with the tim
ber region inoled to form a fairly
correct estimate of the possibilities
of trade that might be opened up
thereby As a rule, the Ledger is
opposed to multiplying roads in well
settled sections of the county But
we know that a different rule must
apply to the undeeloped eastern
portion of the county If the mag
nificent forests of pine, now irgin
and silent, can be made a hie of in
dusty, giing employment to hun
dreds of men and imparting new
life to the entire country between
the forests and the mining belt, and
distributing among our own people
for [many years to come tens of
thousands of dollars annually that
now go to enrich outside dealers, the
assistance asked from the county
is unworthy of mention when com
pared with the business reial in
sight

Prospecting,; in [ Alaska
On the 3rd of ' July last, fie pf us in
party, started on a prospecting tour,
heading for' Hasting creek We had'
an option upon two claims there- as a
lay, agreeing to gie 20 per cent of the
gross proceeds, to the owner 'of* the
claims, If we found anything to justify
us in taking hold 'of them The place
was eighteen miles south from Nome
We had amongst us a boat capable of
carrying a ton's weight, besides the
oarsman But not a mother's son of
us kuew anything about boating One
of our partners, j E Stone, had some
business to attend to at Nome and
could not go for a day or two, so he
hired a sailor to go in his place, which,
figuratiely speaking, "pTitusin town"
Our proisions, tools, bedding, etc,
were put into the boat and we wore
ready to launch her, it beinjf impossi
ble to put anything in a boat een in
the calmest time that can ho found and
let it stay in the water The surf came
rolling gently scroll like inward and
all bands took hold of the boat to push
it into the water The sailor, and one
of our party, got into the boat, oars in
hand, ready to push out into the sea
wheneer we could force it beyond the
inrolling surf, columns that came with
a periodical," momentary splash upon
the smooth sandy shore ''Pull for the
sea, you sky -lark, " Stone shouted, as
he helped to launch the boat • The
two men leaned with all their strength
on the- oars, and oer the inrolling
surf she started with a die seaward,
and she was now properly en tho wae
The sailor pushed seaward beyond the
inrolling surf and headed, bird like,
southward The other three of us,
considering that a sandy shore was
better than a watery grae or a good
ducking, "hoofed" it along the shore,
following the boat • Earneatly speak
ing-, the Behringe sea is so treacherous
that raon in small boats are too often
in the power of a merciless \*ae, that
may swallow them up foreer in a sec
ond At times the sea, like a huge
leiathan, lies for a short period so
still as to appear to be resting in deep
est slumber; then, without warning, it
awakens as if disturbed from a peace
ful rest, and in its fury lashes the waes
into wrathful columns of furious waes
and seething foam, sending eerything
upon it unprotected to destruction and
death On the Ist of Ju'y last two
sailors with their- row boat was upset
and one of them drowned A woman
and her fourteen year old son were
foolish enough to enture out for a
pleasant ride along close to the shore
Suddenly tho sea grew rough and in
its wrath swallowed up the boat and
left two corpses to drift and be thrown
—God knows where— beneath the
surges of the furious waes A half a
hundred, without a doubt, hae lost
their lies in the last two years in this
treacherous sea by being out in row
boats' No wonder, then, we watched
with solicitude our tiny craft, freighted
with our belongings and two human
souls, as she skipped  like a sea-bird
oer the treacherous deep "Look at
her!" said Stone She was now a mere
speck, and as she followed the troughs
of the sea she disappeared and seemed
momentarily to hae " died beneath
the waes; 'but way out upon the crest
of the rolling surf we saw her reappear
as a tiny spectral form, fleeing liko
some hunted shadow Gone! she was
lost to our sight in the distance Along
the shore we followed our departod
craft About two and a half miles
from Nome a whale lay dead upon' the
shorn It was thirty or forty feot
long, and some men jnrere cutting, great
slabs out of it for food for two or tttree
hundred dogs housed in a great pen a
half mile back of Nome "Look there"
said one of my partners, as we traeled
onward I looked; a long, bright new
oar was being rolled back and forth
upon the beach by the actions of the
waes We secured the oar, and nat
urally enough scanned the ocean, in
search of some derelect tiny craft that
we thought might be wandering aim
lessly at sea; but nothing could we see
sae the wide expanse of the ocean, or
the transport Warren as she lay at
anchor, opposite the goernment bar
racks nearly ten miles away Just
aboe the barracks that are situated
on the beach, beyond the- mouth of
Nome rier, I picked up at the water's
edge nearly a new shoe that was yet
wet with ocean surf It doubtless was
connected with' the oar and went to tell
the tale of horror and death It is
known to be a fact that a drowned-at
sea man will be stripped of his boots or
shoes by the action of  tho waes A
little further up the beach I found a
new buckskin purse that- had caught
on a buried stick and was fluttering as
if trying to get away from the almost
spent waelets that played about, All
that it contained was some ocean sand
that had forced itself within I emptied
the sand out of the purse, washed it,
and now retain it as a souenir
Two of us stopped to talk to a sol
dier and the others walked along
After leaing the soldier we walked for
some time along the sandy beach with
steady, worried tread On suddenly
looking up we saw our two partners
ahead grabbing at" something, then
springing out of the way of the incom
ing surf As we got a little closer we
saw they were fishing Hastening for
ward we saw such a sight of fish as we
neer saw before There were billions
of them If I had only possessod a
common garden rake I could hae se
cured a barrel full i ten minutes The
rolling columns of water that rolled
and scrolled backwards and forwards
was a liing mass of struggling smelt
Luckily, I had a gold pan carrying
that had not been put in^the boat,
which we filled and went^ trudging on
ward" A quarter of a mile ahead a
man was seen coming toward us When
we got close enough we saw it was the
sailor, the pilot of our craft When in
speaking distance, in chorus, we asked
in the deepost anxiety, "What's the
•matter!" "Nothing," ho answered,
with a smile, "tho boat is at the mouth
of Hastingcreek, and your things safely
laid on shore Good bye, boys, and
good luck to you, I must go back to
Nome to-night" With a  steady,
swinging tread, he passed on toward
Nome When we got to Hasting creek
we were surprised to find that our part
ner and the sailor had stretched the
tonts and eerything was beside thorn
ready to be taken in Hasting creek
is a loiig flat creek whose serpentine
windings twist its way toward the clear
blue mountains to the north I the
Uoop gaps of the mountains, glacial ice
sparkle and scintillate in the sunlight
Tho tundra on i sides welter in water
and as one's foot is set down upon it
tdo water spurts with a sissing sound
from under A good deal of wood lay
upon the beach, thrown into inconcei
able shape together This wood had
come down the great Yukon, and car
ried inward by the sea; is drien by
high tide up Hasting creek, and left
upon the shore by the receding waes
Close to our tent, a man, his wife
and two children had stayed the long
cold winter The little boy, fie or six
years old, was soon at the tent His
loquacity run to oerflowing- He could
ask more questions in one minute than
a criminal lawyer could ask in the most
desperuU) uisti examination in ton
I smiled at the boy's interlocutions, for
his tongue was a eritable chatterbox
"Was it cold here this winter?" I
queried "on't know, " he answered,
"Mom didn't let me out to see"
"Much ice?" I asked "Golly! yes, all
ice around here" As he finished, his
mother's oice saner out clear and dis
tinct in the distance, summoning him
to supper Ho sprang like a deer to
his feet, and with boyish delight he
bounded along the sandy beach home
ward We now proceeded to "cook
supper We fried a great mess" of fish,
and when I tasted them I said to my
partners that they equaled the moun
tain trout of California If I had had
that school of smelt close to Amador, I
would f hae turned fish monger and
supplied Amador county with a surfeit
of fish that would hae sent the price
of mountain trout down in the scales
with a jerk The next morning was
the 4th of July No guns boomed out
with joyous greeting; no happy oices
rang along crowded, streets We were
in the wilds of Alaska with a heay
rain pattering down upon the tent A
heay fog hung like a mantle o'er the
ocean, shutting out the sight of the
waes that, bellowed • with continuous
roar in our ears 
Putting on our gum suits we started
up Hasting 'creek Half a mile from
our camp "we found the creek bedded
in ice The water had cut a channel
through it in places six or eight foot
deep We did not feel as cold as might
be supposed We met the fresh pure
air without a shier or a shudder, and
looked o'er the' ast ice bed with de
light The earth- close to the creek
was frozen hard as a stone Tho stream
with its tributaries were so flat as to
appear to be almost leel, and little
lakelets stood in silery sheets eery
whore Not an atom of life matter did
we see, sae a solitary duck winging
his way southward To dig; as well
try to dig in pig N iron as the hard
frozen ground on the creek We turn
ed back to camp satisfied that no pros
pecting could bo done here for a month
The rain had fallen heaily all day,
and we were glad to be beneath the
shelter of the tent We lit a fire in'
our Yukon stoe and cooked our
eening meal The rain continued to
fall heaily all day and without a mom
ent of intermission Wrapt in our
wolf skin robe we fell into a deep,
peaceful slumber, while the storm
played in all its fury without

Remarkable Mortality Coincidence
A singular fatality coincidence, con
cerning two brothers, young men born
and raised in Amador couuty and well
known in Sutter Creek and Jackson,
was telegraphed from Los Angeles last
Friday On that day Roy Watkins of
Sutter Creek receied a message from
a married sister, in Los Angeles that
his brother George,  more generally
known as 'Buz,' died In that city
that morning; and also that a younger
brother, Bert, died in Arizona the
same day,' the two deaths occurring
within about an hour of each other
Buz Watkins loft Jackson three weeks
ago last Monday He was then suf
fering from consumption in an ad
anced stage of that dread disease He
had been in the county hospital for
about a week, and made tbe journey to
the southern city on the initation of
a married sister to make his home with
her, and in the hope that the change
of air might proe beneficial It was
eident to his friends when he left here
that the end was not far off The re
mains were forwarded to Sutter Creek,
where the funeral took place last Sun
day, the body finding its last rest in
the family plot where his parents are
buried Of the death of Bert, Watkins
we hae been informed that be was run
oer by a train and instantly killed at
Gila, Arizona His remains reached
Sutter Creek Tuesday eening, and
were buried by the side of his brother
on Wednesday afternoon "• Personal; "Personal-'_
Both were single men, and were born
and spent thoir boyhood days together
on the old Watkins homestead on Sut
ter hill
The Report Abont a Mew Bank
A statement has been published to
the effect that there was a moement
on foot for the organization of another
bank in Jacksou We are in a position
to state that such a report has no foun
dation whateer A proposition was
started to buy out the bank of Jackson
ennis in Sutter Creek, and Jackson
parties were willing to subscribe to the
moement proided Jackson was in
cluded The idea was to buy both the
Jackson and Sutter Creek financial in
stitutions, and still continue both banks
under one strong corporation, with a
capital or at least $100,000 Such a
bank, with the backing of the principal
capitalists of the county behind it,
would, it was thought, command the
utmost confidence of the business com
munity, and practically control the
banking business of the county The
idea of starting an opposition bank at
the county seat was neer seriously en •
tertained The Jackson bank has been
ably conducted, and has done, and is
still doing, a ery profitable business
considering the amount of capital em
ployed But it was argued that the
business might bo materially increased
under the same management by in
creasing the capital stock For rea
sons which we are' not called upon to
explain, the arrangements could not
be effected at present, so the matter
remains in abeyance for a time, but
cannot be said to hae been dropped
altogether -

Those Water Tanka and Pipe
A meeting has been called of the sub-,
scribers to the fund for sprinkling the
lone road, to meet in the superisors'
room in the Hall of Records, Jackson,
on Wednesday eening next, at eight
o'clock The object of the meeting, as
we understand it, is to ascertain the
wishes of the subscribers as to what
disposition shall be made of the pipe
and watering tanks now strung along
the lone road Shall they be permit
ted to remain where they are and de
teriorate in alue, or shall they be sold
and the money realized therefrom used
for the permanent betterment of tho
road While the superisors hae full
power oer the matter, still it is only
natural that they should seek to keep
i touch with the desires of their con
stituencies It should be borne in mind,
howeer, that the property belongs to
county, and* the superisors hae full
power to take such action as they deem
proper to protect tho interests of the
county If the property is allowed to
become alueless, they Slone will hae
to shoulder the responsibility
A New Concentrator
George Gates returned to Jackson

2400 and 2500 leels of the east shaft
The chutes are huge affairs, estimated
to hold about 1000 tons* of rock each
Crosscutting toward the north' shaft
has been started from both 2400 and

of the east shaft is 2630 feet —by
far the deepest on the mother lode
About 30 men are employed in and

That Amazed a Marylander
"Although I am a Marylander and an
Eastern Shore one at\thnt," said an epi
cure from that state, "and consequent
ly know what good things to eat are, I
want to tell you that Til hae to take
off my hiit f to the lumber camp cook of
the upper -Michigan peninsula ns the
discoerer, \fabrlca tor and dispenser of
a dish that! knocks the Eastern Shore
cuisine silly And that rare lumber
camp dish is beaer tall soup
"I was with Colonel Park of Colum

region of; Michigan one fall We lied
at a lumber camp boarding shanty
"ThereJwere signs of beaer at the
upper end of the lake, and a trapper
succeeded in trapping one of the wily
dam builders
"When the beaer was brought into
camp, thelcanip cook went nearly wild,
and so did the lumbermen when they
heard the news, all because they had
been trying to trap a beaer for weeks,
not for its fur, but for Its tail, ns they
wcrejpining, they said, for beaer tail

"The cookPersonal took that broad appendage
of thp beaer, mailed like an armadillo,
tookffromMt the underlying bone and
meat, andtfrom it made such a soup as

The Morals of Animal*
It may be questioned whether ani
mals hae any conception of morals
as we understand the term, but In a
general sense it would certainly seem
that they hae In the social sense
there Is no doubt as to the answer To
take a well known Instance, the ant
family hae eoled a most complicat
ed social system which apparently
works to perfection, and that la more
than can be said for any human sys
tem In order, cleanliness, care of off
spring, proision for future wants and
military discipline no ciilized society
can compare with theirs They are
slaeholders, It is true, but they treat
their slaes with eery kindness and
consideration, and the warrior ants dfr
fend them in time of danger 
Another excellent example is fur
nished by the beaer uring summer
it leads a solitary life, but at the ap
proach of winter communities are
formed, building operations commence,
stores are laid up as soon as the dwell
ings are completed, and eery Indiidual
of tho wnitn'unlty recognizes clearly
that the interests of the family and
the colony come first In their family
life they, In common with many other
animals, offer' an example which might
well be copied not only by saages, but
also by ciilized communities
Beecber's Open Band
An old member of Plymouth church
who knew Henry Ward Beecher and
his family tells a story about the
great preacher "No one eer knew
what he did with the ast sums of
money he earned as a lecturer," he
said "He used to gie money away
with both hands, and he was as likely
to gie a street beggar a twenty dollar
bill as a dollar; but bis salary from
Plymouth church went direct to Mrs
Beecher intact He neer drew any
money from the church until the end
of the yePersonal-Personal ""'>r-i he receied a check
for $20,000, his mil year's salary, and
handed It to his wife When he died,
he did not leae much of an estate, al
though be had earned millions of dol
lars in his life, but Mrs Beecher had
always receied her $20,000 a year, and
she lied In comfort and een luxury

An Oddltr of Lost Caste
It is not necessary to go to India to
bear curious stories of caste In a pro
feepfonnl man's household' recently a
ajWdseram fell ill of diphtheria Her
mistress nursed her herself through a
tedious illness until she was quite well
When that happy result was establish
ed, the maid immediately informed the
mistress that she intended to leae her
serice The reason of the maid's de
parture was this— "l could not lie -with
a mistress who has been waiting on
me herself" Quite eidently this is not
mere Indifference to kindness or in
gratitude The girl was the slae of
that mysterious influence  of ; caste
which splits up into minute sections
eery modern society, as it split up e
ery ancient society, and seems likely to
split up any future society that it is
possible to imagine— London Saturday

Lemon Extract
A lemon extract that one is sure is
pure can be easily made at home Grate
off enough of the outside peel of lem
ons to fill a small bottle; taking care
that none of the white part of the rind
gets in, as this will gie a bitter taste
When the bottle is full, coer with pure
alcohol and set away for three weeks
At the end of that time the contents
of the bottle should be strained, and
the extract is ready for use An een
teaspoonful of this preparation will

Artists hae many amusing and some
unpleasant experiences when trespass
ing in pursuit of subjects for their art
\Yhen Mr Bought on once saw a man
plowing in a field, he climbed the di
iding wall and began to sketch him
This was too much for the inoluntary
model, who strode up to the artist and
said, "o you know what L,could do
with you?" "I haen't the* slightest
idea," Mr Boughton answered, with a
smile
"Well," the burly plowman said, "I
could chuck you into the road" "You'd
better not do that," Mr Boughton re
torted "Why not go back to your
plow, and I'll whistle for you in half
an hour?" 
To Mr Boughton's surprise the man
obeyed and half an hour later was duly
summoned to inspect the finished pic
ture "How much will they gie you
for that?" he asked after critically
sureying the sketch "Oh, about
f 10!" the artist answered "Well,
I'm hanged!" the astonished plowman
said, scratching his head in perplexity
"I hae to plow two months before I
can earn as much as that"— Tit-Bits
When Cnrates "Were Wanted
When one learns that curates are in
creasing so much more rapidly than
benefices, wonder is excited as to the
condition of affairs in the eighteenth
century, when enterprising ladies of
fered liings to clergymen willing to
marry them An adertisement to this
effect appeared in the London Chroni
cle in March, 1758 The lady was rath
er particular too The curate was to
be young, hae a small fortune, be well
recommended ns to morals arid good
temper "and be firmly attached to the
present happy ' establishment" • The
liing was not rich— below £100 per an
num — but the fair one was young and
agreeable There seems a touch of
humility in the direction that answers
"may be left at the bar of the Union

surance that "the utmost secrecy and
honor may be depended upon"—Lon

Slerry Memories of a Pint meeting
With Aitemm 'Ward -
On going Into the Cleeland Plain
ealer editorial rooms one morning I
saw a new man, who was introduced
to me as Mr Browne
He was young, clfperful in manner,
tall and slender, not quite up to date
in style of dress,  yet by- no means
shabby His hah* was flaxen and ery
straight; his nose, the prominent fea
ture of his face, was Romanesque—
quite iolently so— and with a leaning
to the left His eyes were blue gray,
XVith a twinkle in them; his mouth
seemed so gien to a merry laugh, so
much in motion, that it was difficult
to describe  "-
It seemed as though bubbling In him
was a lot of happiness which he made
no effort to conceal or hold back
When we were introduced, he was sit
ting at his table writing He gae his
leg a smart slap, arose, shook hands
with me and said he was glad to meet
me I belieed him, for he looked glad
all the time You could not look at
him but he would laugh He laughed
as he sat at his table writing When
he had written a thing which pleased
him, he would slap his leg and laugh
I noticed that George Hoyt and
James Brokenshire at their tables were
pleased with his merriment and in
dulged in broad smiles As I bade him
and the others good morning he said,
''Come again, me liege" I thanked
him, said I would and went my way,
thinking what a funny fellow he was
Within a month thereafter appeared
in the columns of The Plain ealer a
funny letter signed "Artemus Word"
The writer said he was in the show
business, had a trained kangaroo, "a
most amoosln' little cuss," some
"snaix" and a collection of wax fig
ures, which he called a "great moral
show" As he was coming to Clee
land to exhibit he made a proposition
to the proprietor that they "scratch
each other's backs"— the publisher to
write up the show igorously and the
showman to hae the handbills print
ed at his office and gie him free tick
ets for all his family So I found my
young friend of the gurgle and hay
colored hair to be an embryo humorist
Just bursting into bloom Artemus, as
from that time he was best known,
soon had a city full of friends, myself
and family among them— James P

Cleaning; Jewell
With the exception of pearls jewels
may be washed with warm water and
pure soap- They should then be put
In boxwood sawdust to dry If this" is
done, polishing will be unnecessary
As boxwood sawdust Is ery fine It
will not scratch, and as it absorbs
moisture rapidly It helps to gie Jewels
a high polish It can be procured from
any dealer In jeweler's supplies or or
