ha flowers made ino "swees" are of
any medicinal efficacy, hough damask

This iem had been dropped ou of he

One of he firs aricles aken up by

The public is unwiingly defrauded

"We shall see hem anon," said he

and from absence of bad habis; from

from absence of docors' bills and from
a direc reurn in he way of com

The founder and main supporer of
he moemen is Mr George H Max
well, edior of Maxwell's Talisman and

ha college selemens and similar

"Eery child in a garden, eery moher

In a home of his own on he land"
MENING OF HOMECROFT
The word "Homecrof" has been
coined by Mr Maxwell o fi he hing
he has in mind The Scoch word
"crof" means a ery small piece of
land farmed inensiely by is occu
pan bu no large enough o yield him
a liing and consiue him a farmer
The Homecrofer, herefore, under he
condiions being deeloped, is a labor
ing man, clerk, skilled arisan or wha
no, who supplemens his regular in
come by, and spends his spare ime in,
work on he land His children may
likewise be employed ou of school

In Great Britain alcohol made un
drinkable by the addition of 5 per at
of wood alcohol and a much smaller
proportion of mineral nnptha Is now
sold freely without tax. Since 1887
Germany also had untaxed alcohol for
industrial purposes. France, . witzer
land, Holland, Belgium, Italy, Russia,
Sweden, Norway, Austria-Hungary,
Tortugal and six Latin-American re
publics exact no tax on this "dena
tured" alcohol, already regarded as
one of the necessities of agriculture,
manufacture and general lndus+-v.
In these "free-alcohol countries" there
are being used many varieties of al
cohol engines, alcohol automobiles, al
cohol motor boats, alcohol frm
motors, alcohol lamps and alcohol
stcnes.
ALREADY SUCCEEDS IN EUROPE.
C CSprmnnT hns far surpassed In all
o of these inventions, which were largely
m mothered by necessity, for the father
lland has no natural gas or petroleum.
R Rut its broad sandy plains produce
f fheap and abundant crops of potatoes.
f f rom which every farmer n manu
ffacture a vast quantity of raw alcohol.
T Tnventors andseientistshave been busy
w with improvements in farm distilleries,
m motors, lamps, cooldn" and heating
'inpararns. Their "spirit motors" are
b being turned out in all forms
r right and horizontal, stationary, por
ttable and locomotive. Alcohol loco-
m motives pull trains of a dozen cars on
l lnrtre farms, smear plantations and
e engineering works. The army has h«d
b built ten horse-power alcohol "en-
g gineers' wagons," each with a speed
o of ten miles an hour, carrying tools
a and apparatus for a regiment Of en
ggineers.
T The cost of converting this 9ena
tured (or undrinkable) alcohol back
into its original condition would be
much more than for making pure al
cohol anew, according to Dr. Wiley.
He thinks the best method of making
it undrinkable would be the addition
of ten per cent, wood alcohol and one
per cent, of "pyridine." According to
the bill as it passed, the denaturing
ingredients are left to the discretion of
the internal revenue tax.
SOME NEW PARISIAN LINGERIE.
Colors In Blouses Very Fashionable.
Especially the Delicate Tints.
BERTHA BROWNING.
In the new Paris lingerie, the
fashion is to have sets of chemise,
drawers and short petticoat of the
same material and type, and all
trimmed in the same manner. Nain
sook and very fine batiste are the ma
terials usually employed for their con
struction, the mode of silk underwear
being for the time abandoned. There
are two new fabrics called silk nain
sook and silk chiffon, both cotton, but
of very fine weave, and which do not
lose their glossy appearance in wash
ing. These materials have much the
appearance of silk and In garments
made of them lace is profusely used.
The lace composes much of the upper
portion of the chemise and the sleeves
which are of bell shape reaching al
most to the elbow. These are open
A NEW UNDERGARMENT
nearly to the shoulder over the fore
arm, where they are loosely tied with
a succession of ribbon bows. In lin
gerie garments the square neck is
preferred to the round this year, and
this is always finished with a band of,
lace or embroidery.
The empire form is, of course, very
fashionable for chemises, but, while
it is a pretty cut, it needs to be made
of very fine material else its straight
form will lie in folds beneath the cor
set. Most chemises now-a-days are
shaped in under the arms so as to do
away with this extra width at the
waist-line. A pretty finishing to take
the place of sleeves and shoulder parts
on a garment to be worn with decol
lette dress, consists of ribbons which
tie on the shoulders and may be un
tied and slipped beneath the bodice
when worn with the evening gown.
The Japanese nightgown of quite
loose cut is a decided novelty. This
has rows of little tucks descending
from the shoulder and extending half
way down the figure. A double band
of insertion starts at the foot of the
gown, passes by the side of the tucks
over the right shoulder and around
the neck at the back, meeting in the
centre of the front at the waistline.
The sleeves are loose and flowing as
befits a garment of this nature. Few
nightdresses have collars, most of
them being finished with straight
bands of embroidery or lace.
CHARMING DRESSING SACKS.
Some very jaunty little dressing
sacks of silky batiste or nainsook are
being constructed. These are entire
ly accordeon pleated, except for a por
tion of the sleeve. Lace and insertion
surround the throat, and for those of
Empire cut, a band of the same marks
the high waistline in back and in
front rises over the bust to be fastened
with ribbons. Some of these lingerie
tea jackets have broad and elaborate
collars which reach over the should
ers.
Another new comer is the blouse
waistcoat of embroidered linen, batiste
or mousseline de soie. This Is made
without sleeves and drawn in about
the waist with a tare to adjust the ful
ness in front. These are designed to
be worn with lingerie suits of which
a long or short jacket forms a part
Lingerie petticoats are of increasing
daintiness. They are for the most part
elaborately trimmed, the top portion
being of sheath-like cut and fitting
without a bit of fulness. They are
completed with broad flounces of
tucks, embroidery and lace. Some of
these flounces show several frillings
of lace or embroidery, while others
are elaborate with hand-embroidered
designs.
Violets.
The roses I sent were red.
My rival sent her white;
My heart is torn with doubt and fear—
Which will she wear to-night?
I hear her step upon the stair,
Ah, Fortune, now disclose!
My lady comes; stand still, my heart!
Whose violets are those?
One Alore on Mary.
From Technical World,
"Mary had a little lamb.
Just thirty years ago;
The chops we had for lunch to-day
Were from that lamb, we know."
Q. E. D.— How old is Mary?
The Pope's Wardrobe.
A large number of women are em
ployed at the Vatican solely in keep
ing the Pope's wardrobe in perfect
condition. No spot or stain may dis
figure his garments, and, as he always
appears in white, even a few hours'
wear deprives the robes of their fresh
ness. Women are permitted to servp
the Pontiff in this one respect only,
us male attendants are not considered
suitable for the work. Only the most
delicate materials are used — moire silk
In summer, and a specially woven fine
cloth In winter.
THE MESSAGE.
"Listen," said Kaleigh, aud suddenly
seized my hand.
"That is nothing but the alarm clock
in the next room," I said.
He did not seem to hear what 1 said,
but kept on listening to the strange,
rattling noise, and I saw beads of cold
perspiration on his forehead, while his
hand turned cold as ice. Nevertheless
there was in his eyes a far away look
of expectancy, of dawning joy.
"It is nothing at all," I repeated. "I
do not understand what is the matter
with yon. Tell me."
"Oh, never mind," he answered, "but
surely you heard it as well as I.
Didn't you?"
"Well, then, the time has come. For
hours, days, years, I have expected It,
have ofttimes longed for, and still,
now, when it has come, it seems hard
to leave this world so suddenly."
"Nonsense," I said, "what has the
alarm clock to do with your death?"
He looked at me with the same won
derful expression In his eyes, and
said:
"Well, I will tell you what I have
never told any one before."
"You remember that Lora died tnree
years ago."
"She died at exactly twenty-three
minutes of five in the afternoon. Look
at your watch and see what tune it
is now."
I looked at my watch.
"Just twenty minutes of five."
"Yes, and three minutes ago that
alarm went off, just at the hour and
minute of her death."
I looked at Raleigh in astonishment.
"Well, even If that is so, I do not
see what Lora's death has to do with
you."
"With me! Oh! but you don't Rjow,
even my dearest friend. How should
you know that Lora was my wife.
Nobody knew It but ourselves."
"Lora was your wife!"
"Yes, my wife," he replied, with
tears in his eyes. "You know how her
father hated me and why. But she
loved me as I loved her, and »o we
married secretly a few weeks before
she died. I was not at her deathbed
and would not have known had not
the mainspring broken In 'at very
clock we just heard with just the same
peculiar noise. At the moment it hap
pened a feeling of deadly terror over
powered me. I rushed to her house,
but they would not let me In. I cried
that she was my wife, but they
slammed the door in my face, anjl I
swooned away.
"When I came to my senses again I
was here. How I got to my rooms I
do not know, but I do know that she
was with me and at my side, pale as
a ghost.
" 'Lora,' I cried. She turned to me
and said: 'Wait for me, dear, the clock
will call you.'
"'Lora,' I cried aga)n. Another
woman stood at my side. 'He is de
lirious,' she said. 'We must renew the
lcebag.'
"Now you have heard It just as I
did. The clock has called and I must
go."
"But, Raleigh " I began.
He interrupted me.
"Do not say anything," he whis
pered. "I know it and lam ready. I
have been waiting so long — oh, so
long. Good bye!"
He reached eagerly forward, as If
to embrace some one, but suddenly
fell back into my arms, his face trans
ligured Into the most beautiful ex
pression I have ever seen. "Do you
see her? There at the door! 1 am
coming, I am coming, my darling."
A tremor went through him and he
was dead. — The Oklahoman.

In the Philippine Islands some ot
the Chinamen are extremely clever at
swindling, one of their tricks being to
remove whiskey from a bottle and sub
stitute an adulteration without break-
Ing the seal. They do this by soaking
oft the label and drilling a tiny hol«
in the side of the bottle. They then
take out the whiskey and substitute
a liquid similar in color, fill up the
hole, and cover it with the label. •
