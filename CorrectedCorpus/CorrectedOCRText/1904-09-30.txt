Icon Subject
Icons may represent anything from
the figure of a saint to a historical
scene, such as a martyrdom Often
they take the form of a diptych or a
triptych or a polyptych crowded with
angular or diminutie figures of saints
or miniature scenes from the life of the
Virgin or some other Biblical person
age From the number of scenes con
tained in these objects the peasants
came to call them "churches," for there
were not more pictorial representations
within the church itself Such icons
may be of brass or of cared boxwood,
being sometimes ornamented with en
tmels " Personal "\
urability of Iory
The durability of iory is proed by
the fact that billiard balls, which foi

of well presered mammoth iory un

were played with for seeral months
by experienced players without its be

THE WHITE HOUSE
President Madlaon's Part In Thw
NamingPersonal the Bxccntle Manxloii
Just how the White House cure tc
be so designated is a question on which
historians differ  local historlnn in
Washington thinks that the bunion ol
proof tends to jjie credit for the nanif
to President Vadison
The structure was made of Potoinat
rier freestone, 11 ml the cnpftol propel
was built of the pame ctone t thf
time the British burned the executie
mansion they did a lot of other dam
age, and the country was pressed foi
money to repair tho same The walls
of the mansion were only slightly dam
aged, other than being blackened by
smoke Honey was scarce, and con
gress made an appropriation to hare
the outside of the house painted White
was selected as the best color Madison
In a letter to a personal friend wrotePersonal
"Come in and see me at any time You
will always find me in at the White
House"; , ' PersonalL< "" 
The executie mansion may hae
been called Jhe White House before
that time, but this inestigator saye
that he hae neer been able, to find any
record of it If Madison did not offi
ciate at the christening it has been
emphatically stated by the historian
that he took a prominent part In pub
lishing the fact that the White House
was to be the name of the mansion
Up to the time of President Madison
the executie mansion, which Is the
legal name for it, was generally spo
ken of as the president's house, bui
since then it has been known by its
permanent name of White House

healthy, robust lies to the square Inch
than an aerage map, and this Is the
document that is dally placed in the
hands of our young
i ßegin' p i north and take Greenland
; Was there eer a more flagrant impos
ture than the name of this country?
It isn't green and neer was green and
neer will be green" Here is what the
gazetteer says about this ''fcreen" coun
tryPersonal
s high and rocky and barren ; It
Is^coered with eternal snow and gla
ciers % July Is the only month in which
there is no snow" There's a picture ol
greenness f or you! •Personal';£
How did it get called green? Well,
by an unscrupulous falsehood on the
part of a tenth century reprobate
called Eric the Red of Iceland This
ancient shark accidentally ran against
the Ice patch in question with a few
other Icelanders of his own kidney
He cut back to Iceland and "boomed"
it for all he was worth
He called it Greenland and to delude
the Iceland inestors and genera] pub
lic said it was a wonderful green coun
try, which he wished them to isit
with their families and take shares In
some mines he had discoered Well,
some of the deluded creatures went
They neer returned to good old Ice
land any more
But there are plenty of equally gross
Impostures Take the Black sea, for
instance Why black? Who said 11
was black? It Is no more black than
it Is pink or purple The ancients call
ed it the "Euxlne"— which means "in
hospitable"—sea That was another
good old fiction It Is not at nU an la
hospitable sea, for, haying no tides, it
is one of the easiest to naigate Now
and again there are big storms, just to
gie the sea a realistic touch, but gen>
erally speaking it isn't black, and it
isn't inhospitable •
The Cape of Good, Hope} Good
Hope, indeed,', eH anybody who has
been round that promontory what they
think of it The only "good hope" they
experience is a good hope that they
will soon get ashore, for it is one of
the roughest and stormiest places
known to mariners What we should
call a cyclone on the North sea would
be smiled at round the cape as a bit of
breeze The gentleman who called it
Cape, of Good Hope^as  crude sort
of humqriat, \jie,'tnade his money in
the king business, styling himself John
11 of Portugal His faithful subject
iaz discoered It andTtoW his majesty
that he had colled Jt the "Stormy
cape," But the king would hae none
of It He said that be hoped iaz
would find something else round the
other Bide next time he went to the
cape, so he called it Cape of Good
Hope
Why the ead sea? The locality
may be as dead as a doornail,' but tfce
sea itself is pretty liely, It is the
saltest piece of water, on the face of
the earth, ten, times as, salt na the
ocean" Of course there, is no particular
egetation roundabout, and the sea la
free from monsters, but that doesn't
make the sea itself dead It is really
a most lie sea
Why English channel? It's no more
English than it's French The French
themseles don't call it English at all,
but simply "La Manche"  •
Then was eer a rnqre absurd name
gien to that bit of water which sepa
rates England from Holland, called
the German ocean? Why German?
There's nothing German about it and
neer has ] been utch, Belgian or
British, if you like, but not German
Then why ocean? It is not an, ocean at
all There is a piece of water that size
between, ustralia and Tasmania, if
anything rather wider, which they call
a strait— Bass strait Just fancy the
absurdity of teaching the child mind to
think that crossing to Ostend ox nt>
werp Is an bcea,n trip
Jforth sea, too, is absurd Why north?
It is not north of anything In particu
lar It is east of Britain, west of Hol
land, Belgium and enmark and south
of Norway and, Sweden It is not a
rtqrtjj sea at all
There are some islands in the Pacific
—why Pacific, by the way? Where
does the peace come In on that deso
late, typhoony, billowy, tidal way wil
derness called the Friendly islands?
Look at the encyclopedia's ersion of
their friendlinessPersonal "They are olcanic,
and earthquakes are frequent Islands
are frequently upheaed Hurricanes
are constant" Then the friendly na
ties! The sole reason the islands were
called Friendly is because when Cap
tain Cook isited them he found the
naties had not got any arms So they
were friendly No doubt! But when
the missionaries tried to conert them
they had a different tale to tell For
thirty years they endured "a perilous
struggle with the saage paganism of
the inhabitants"

SEQUELS TO STORIES
Km a Rule They re Hot as Good aa
the Earlier Books
The question of sequels was nnder dis
cussion in a literary gathering the oth
er day, and the consensus of opinion
was decidedly against them It was
een roundly maintained that no se
quel had eer been a success from the
literary point of iew Some one de
murred and suggested "Paradise Re
gained," but that suggestion, greeted
with a burst of laughter, practically
determined the argument "Paradise
Regained" was a distinct falling off
from "Paradise Lost" It might een
be declared a dignified, diurnal failure
No; Milton's sequel was no 'exception
to the rule
 If there be a rule, are there any ex
ceptions that proe it? Steenson's
"Catriona" was not up to the leel of
"Kidnaped" Mr nthony Hope wrote
a better book in "The Prisoner of Zen
da" than he did In "Rupert of Hent
zau" Wise authors neer undertake
sequels Once upon a time Mr Rider
Haggard was tempted to adenture a
sequel to "She," but repented at dis
cretion It Is altogether a different
matter when successie books include
the same character Thackeray used
that trick in "Pendennis" and "The
Newcomes," but in no sense Is the lat
ter a sequel to the former In a way
Thackeray's noels may be said to
constitute a chain right down from
"Esmond" The links subsist, but
there Is no continuity of narratie
which defines a sequel proper
He who will may compare the re
spectie merits of Zola's "L'ssom
molr" and "Nana" There does not ap
pear to be, much to choose between
them, but undoubtedly the earlier book
has been more popular Zola's habit,
as is well known, was to keep the same
families In his arious treatises, for to
him they were specimens of natural
history and mightily portentous Con
trast with Zola our immortal Fielding,
who began one of his noels by way of
a parody of Richardson It would be
interesting to collect into one olume
the stories of the masterpieces Id
what circumstances were the great
books of the world written? Think of
umas pere and his firm of assistants!

 Japanese Shrine
 romantic custom of the Japanese
is described in the "Kokoro"of Lafcadlo
Hearn It is narrated that those who
nre anxious for the safety of absent

yama to perform a singular rite There
Is a shrine at the summit to commemo
rate a princess of antiquity who daily
watched hopelessly until she pined and
died, when her body was changed into
stone One who looks with the eyes
of a belieer still sees the princess on
Mount akeyama In the shape of a
perpendicular rook Before her shrine
are heaps of pebbles, and those who
ascend to pray for the safe home com
ing of one they lore take a pebble
awny with them as a talisman nd
when at last reunited with the beloed,
another pilgrimage is made to the
shrine on akeyama to replace the
pebble, with a handful of others, in de

The crown of womanhood is motherhood
But uneasy lies the head that wears the
crown or anticipates this coronation, when
there is a lack of womanly strength to bear
the burdens of maternal dignity and duty
The reason why so many women sink under
the strain of motherhood is because they
are unprepared
• "I unhesitatingly adise expectant moth
ers to use r Pierces Faorite Prescrip
tion," writes Mrs JW G Stephens, of Mila,
Northumberland Co, Va The reason for
this adice is that r Pierces Faorite Pre
scription is the best preparatie for the
maternal function No matter how healthy
and strong a woman may be, she cannot
use "Faorite Prescription" as a prepara
tie for maternity without gain of health
and comfort But it is the women who are
not strong who best appreciate the great
benefits receied from the use of "Faorite
Prescription" For one thing its use makes
the baby's adent practically painless It
has in many cases reduced days of suffer
ing to a few brief hours It has changed
the period of anxiety and struggle into a
time of ease and comfort
The proprietors and makers of octor
Pierces Faorite Prescription now feel
fully warranted in offering to pay $500 for
any case of Leucorrhea, Female Weakness,
Prolapsus, or Falling of Womb, which they

TO, FIRST VOTERS
 There are many citizens within
the limits of mador county who
will cast their first ote at the com
ing national election  larjje pro
portion are young nsu, who hae
just arried at the oting age
Others are naturalized citizens, who
hae recently been admitted to the
full enjoyment of the rights of citi
zenship But whether natieborn
or naturalized, it behooes these cit
izens on the threshold of their oting
career to consider well the responsi
bilities and duties they are about to
assume "With which political or
ganization shall I cast my lot," is a
question that comes home to each one
of them To some the old argument
will be usedPersonal "You must tread in
the footprints of your parents Your
father belonged to such a party,
you cannot do otherwise than ote
the same way" To the man who is
able to do his own thinking, this line
of reasoniug will appear anything
but satisfactory He will want to
get back of this argument and ask
himself, "Was my father right when
he made his political home with this
or that party?" Upon the answer
returned by his conscience his course
of action will be goerned, assum
ing that he is composed of that
material that impels him to act in
accordance with his judgment
To the other class of new oters
the appeal will be madePersonal "The bulk
of the citizens from your natie land
hae joined the republican or demo
cratic party, as the case may be
You can hardly afford to choose a
different path It is important in
order to secure political prestige
and future recognition, that the
people of your nationality present a
united front politically Neer
mind about quibbling oer the issues
that diide political parties; let us
stand together, and thereby consult
our own indiidual interests We
can more surely gain our proper
share of the spoils of office by pre
senting an unbroken front"
Voters do not change politics
readily s the first ote is cast
the chances are the oter will re
main with the same party thereafter
It requires more independence of
character to break loose from po
litical "ties that hae existed for
years, than to weigh the arguments
pro and con in the first place, and
start from conictions arried at
after careful study 
We ask these young oters to look
into the political history of the two
great parties, and decide the matter
dispassionately and intelligently
Let them consider what the repub
lican party has done for the nation;
the principles for which it has
fought; the mighty progress the
country has made in all the elements
that go to make up the sum total of
prosperity under its guidance; the
liberal laws it has placed upon the
statute books under the influence of
which the United States has ad
anced as uo other nation has done
in the same space of time since the
world began '  party must be
judged not merely by what it ado
cates, but the practical results of
the application of its policy On this
proposition the republican party
asks to be judged Leaing out of
the question the great issues in
oled in the war of the rebellion —
issues that hae been settled irre
ocably in faor of the stand  taken
by the liberal party^there still re
mains a wide field for inquiry ur
ing its 0 years of almost uninter
rupted rule, the population has
nearly trebled ; the wealth per capita
has also trebled Our export trade
is about fie times as large as it was
in 1856 Our imports hae grown
three fold The waste lands hae
been filled up with happy and con
tented homes under the influence of
homestead laws No political party
has eer existed that accomplished
so, much in the same space of time
Political opponents will try to at
tribute tfcis magic growth to other
than the true causes Indeed,
the last democratic conention held
at St Louis has candidly admitted
that the stand of the republican
party ou the money question has
been indicated by the act of God in
proiding gold in the earth in suf
ficient quantities to make it the sole
standard of alues What a com
pliment to the forethought and
judgment of the republican party
If on the other hand the oter
candidly looks into the record of the
democratic party he will find that
for the past fifty years it has been
merely an organization of opposi
tion It has been antagonistic to
eery forward step taken by the
party in power which has contrib
uted to the wonderful deelopment
of the country The protectie
tariff, the homestead laws, the
national banking system, the re
sumption of specie payment, the ex
tension of the national domain, all
were opposed as inimical to the wel
fare of the nation Its cherished
ideas of goernmental policy hae
gone down in defeat It ransacks
theyrae of the past for its inspira
tion What progressie measure of
any note has it championed and car
ried 10 ictory within the past half
ceutury In its last national con
ention it surrendered about eery
idea for which it had preiously con
tended It has led its deotees into
the wilderness, and left them there
to shift for themseles To cap the
climax the party leaders in the cam
paign now on are telling the people
they need not be afraid of an in
dustrial panic in the eent of Par
ker'd election, because there will be
a republican senate at any rate as
a bulwark against unwise demo
cratic legislation This is the party
that is now appealing to be en
trusted with national affairs Be
tween these two great parties what
intelligent first oter will long hesi
tate before reaching a determination
to rast his lot with the republicans
PRKER N FREE TRE
There are loud wails of horror in
that pprtion of the Parker press
which looks upon tariff reform as a
sacred thing because of President
Rooseelt's flatfooted declaration
in faor of the protectie system as
something so firmly established in
the minds of the merican people
that it is folly to think of changing
 Well, what is Parker going to do
about it? Will he come out in faor
of immediate and radical tariff re
ision? Will he take his stand
squarely on the St Louis platform,
which declares that "Protection is
robbery?" Will he follow the lead
of the New York Reform Club and
make that iew of the tariff the lead
ing issue of the campaign?
It will be interesting if he does,
for he took occasion in his speech of
acceptance to say that he was in
faor of moderate and deliberate
tariff reduction, but he begged to as
sure the merican people that they
need hae no apprehension, because
the senate would be con tiuued to be
controlled by the 'republicans for
four years longer, and the demo
crats, if put in power, could not do
any barm anyway " pp the', free
trade worshippers wish proci fcftm
into making himself ridiculous? 'p r
ON'T REMOVE  SHINGLE
Under the stimulus and with the
protection of wise legislation in con
gress, inaugurated by the republican
party, the country has made great
progress in material ways in the
past ten years It has required ten
years to bring us to our present con
dition of prosperity The oters
must realize that a considerable por
tion of that ten years' work could
be undone, practically, in a few
moments of time required to cast a
democratic ballot for congressman
and president, if it should turn out
that a majority of the otes cast
were democratic
Eeryone knows it is easier to tear
down than to build It is so in pol
itics as well as in physics The
oters who hae built up the repub
lican legislatie structure should be
careful that they don't remoe so
much as a shingle from the roof this
fall nd that admonition applies
as well to the independent and the
gold democrat as to the republicans,
for it was through their united
efforts that a republican congress
has been maintained in power long
enough to accomplish this work
ll of which means that the wisest
course is to elect a republican house
of representaties this fall
 Caminetti opened his campaign
last Saturday at'Placerille Cami
netts a worthy exponent of the
party that tries to fool the people all
the time He always has some pet
ideas, with which he imagines he can
hoodwink the oters This trip it is
Japanese exclusion, which is all ery
well in its place But why does he
not put up the barriers against un
desirable immigration from Europe?
He also adocates a national uni
ersity, and that the high schools
throughout the county be aided with
funds from the national treasury
Just think of the raiding excursions
against the treasury surplus which
this plan would encourage Then
be is in faor of tariff reision, in
accordance with the democratic idea
that "tariff protection is robbery"
Gillette is a safe man identified
with a sane party Caminetti, like
the party behind him, is full of
agaries of the wildest character

OflJce^530 California street Room S8; Sun
Francisco, California y't'i
 F oi'tMinute Visit Each to Two of
Onr Rural Schools
To many of our readers forty minutes
would seem an insufficient timo in
which to form any rational idea of the
character of work being done by either
teacher or pupil, but to the erson who
has spent many years of his lift) in the
schoolroom it is ample time for him to
determine to a considerable degree the
ability of the teacher to impart know
ledge and tho aptitude of the pupil to
understand the instruction gien
Realizing as I do that no two teachers
follow out the came line or plan' of in
struction, I make it  rule upon enter
ing the school room as a isitor to lay
aside all indiidual methods and adapt
myself for the time being to those used
by the teacher in charge This I did
on Monday, the 19th inst, wliorJ I en
tered the cosy little building prepared
by the citizens of New York Kanch
district as a suitable place for their
children to receie instruction at the
hands of competent teachers, to enable
them the better to go forth into the
busy world and cope successfully with
other business men and women
School had just called after the noon
hour Teacher and pupils had noticed
that I was on the grounds and would
probably enter in a few moments
They did not wait for me When I
walked in all were bu3y The teacher
stopped long enough to greet me
cordially, ask me to be seated, ana was
off again in a moment to assist a young
ster in the back seat who seemed to be
puzzled oer some difficult problem in
arithmetic The next minute she was
helping a studious, girl in sentence
building, and in less time than it takes
to tell it she was discussing' a story
with a boy who some day may become
one of our great philosophers or in
entors This was continued for 15
minutes, during which time I obsered
that the walls were well filled with
maps and decorated with flags and
bunting The building was suitably
furnished, and the seats,' teacher's
desk and library case had been proper
ly cared for The windows were clean,
and it appeared that eery boy and
girl had combed his or her hair just
before entering the room Recitations
were now in order, and it seemed to me
as though the little ones took pride in
reciting in my presence They under
stood their work well, and if any one
expressed a doubt on any point the
teacher gae an explanation that could
be easily understood I entered into
conersation, with the larger classes,
and found them to be readers, ob
serers, talkers and thinkers — the
ery persons" whom the public school
expects, or tries to make, of all its
pupils
Encouraged by trustees and teacher
tho pupils had gien entertainments
and fenced the lot, dug a well, "and
built a beautiful well house Ten boys
and ten girls being taught by one, who
not many years ago was a student Personal in
the public school, and later a graduate
of a higher institution of learning
Miss aisy E Larson may well reel
proud that she is at the head of one of
the great educational institutions' of
the state — a successful public school
Tuesday afternoon I isited the Pine
Gro9 school, but arried too late to
see all the pupils, as the two lower
grades had been dismissed Thirty 
ono well dressed, intelligent looking
boys and girls were present howeer,
and although tne teicher gae her en
tire attention to the recitations the
best of order preailed It was the
first opportunity I hae had to listen
to a recitation from the newly adopted
primary geography, and the class
showed great interest in the subjects
bnder discussion The teacher stood
ready and willing at all times to gie
information independent of the text
book ;
Tho ninth grade, consisting of fie
girls and one boy, gae an interesting
recitation in ciil goernment The
girls all agreed that if they were eer
gien the electie franchise they would
exercise it Questions by pupils and
teacher brought out understandingly
eery phase of the subject contained in
the lesson Pine Groe will no doubt'
hae a fine graduating class in June
Tho trustees hae done their part, and
supplied tho school with many 'con
eniences Miss Maud E Read, the
teacher, graduated but a few years ago
from a nearby grammar school Sho
has since taken a Normal course and is
a natural teacher Here, are two
schools side by side presided oer by
progressie teachers, differing materi
ally in their methods of instruction, but
both accomplishing the same results

Jackson merchants are endeaoring
to get their supply of heay goods in

The opinion is freely expressed that
in the eent of a seere winter the lone
road will be almost impassable  In
fact, freighters assert that if the winter
proes anything like last season, the
freight rates from lone will be more
than doubled The heay trael of
the dry season has cut the road up ter
ribly There is prospect ahead for
still heaier traffic between now and
new years, on account of the machinery
fqr the electric plant to be hauled oer
t ,This will handicap tljo rqad badly
rtiere are, therefore, good grounds to
apprehend a heay increase of freight
rates, and merchants and others ha
ing large consignments are adopting a
wise course in preparing to get their
joods hauled early in the season The
Personalouop!etion of the railroad by the new

the general opinion is that there is a
ilim prospect pf its completion by that

Only the God who gae them knows

Ere their feet are weary on life's sad track,
Ere sin has blighted or sorrow has stung
Or the dear ones' hae gone whom they loed

started in on the 22d of September and
continued until Monday stands without
any parallel in this section for the
month of September since we hae
kept a record of the weather condi

considered heay een in midwinter

Loaded With Steel for Sixteen Months
Chris Uzoicb, a miner employed at
the Gwin, has met with a singular ex
perience Some sixteen months ago he
was injured in the hand, supposed to
hae been caused by a piece of steel
The wound healed up, but it has caused
him more or less pain eer since
Latterly the pain increased to such an
extent as to interfere with his work
He came to Jackson to consult a doctor
about it fter an examination the
doctor was coninced that the presence
of some foreign body buried in the
Hesh was the cause of the trouble He
opened the hand, and extracted there
from a piece of steel as large as the tip
of one's finger The patient is mend
ing rapidly, and will soon be fully re
coered

The Girl
From the East
Marjorie  Barkley
Copi/ify/it, J90, b]i T C McClure
There; was excitement among the
young 'officers at Fort Wayne when
Hicks, the little corporal who wore his
cap on the side of his head, spread the
report that the girl from the east had
tome and had been escorted to Colonel
Klein's house ''•
uring that first day there was an
unusual amount of promenading in
Officers' row Lieutenants, sergeants
and een corporals found time to walk,
in approed military style, past the
colonel's quarters, and there was one
who showed signs neither of excite
ment nor ' iuterest It was Captain
Roberts, lie told his friend, a first
lieutenant, that he wouldn't go around
the corner to see twenty girls Where
at the lieutenant grunted and said
something about behaior in the Phil
ippines, adding, with frank sarcasmPersonal
"You're a peach, you are, to pose as a
woman hater after cutting me out
with the little senorita so clean that
eery fellow in the regiment was afraid
to hae you see his girl I know you
all right, old pal, and I'll bet with the
rest that you take your little stroll In
the row on the heels of some big head
ed corporal I passed the house my
self," he owned boldly, "aud I saw her
too She's a regular beaut, ick"
But een his best friend failed to
awaken the interest of the captain He
went so far as to get into citizen's
clothes that same afternoon and leae
the fort for a walk in the rier road
This, by the critical corporals, was con
sidered stock up
When the captain reached a sandy
strip of beach a mile or more from the
fort he stretched out at full length
and gazed at the water where freight
aud passenger steamers passed on their
routes to the great lakes
His thoughts, whether, they were
upon commerce or naigation, were
profound indeed, for he started when
he heard the rush of a woman's skirts
and saw from the corner of his eye
that a girl was approaching He mo
ed a little, but did not look in her di
rection until the girl stopped and said
softlyPersonal "I beg your pardon, but isn't
this— it is! ick, I knew it was you!"
Captain Roberts sprang to his feet
and looked into the girl's flushed facePersonal
"It's Margaret, ick," she said
"Peggy" ,
Roberts took the hand she offered
"Peggy," he said wonderingly "Peg
gy, you take my breath away Where
did you come from?"
"I'm staying at Colonel Klein's, but
where did you come from?"
"You, at the fort?" he asked in
credulously "That's where I lie Sit
down here on this rock Peggy, Peg
gy dams, do you realize how you
hae surprised me? When did you
strike these parts?"
"This morning"
"No! Then you're the girl from the
east? They'e been talking about you
for weeks"
t"IIow loely of them— and you?"
"Why, I'm up there too"
"Those clothes?" she said doubtful
ly
"re 'cits,' "he finished, smiling "I
wear a uniform up there" 
"Oh! nd what are yon— what
rank?"
"Captain," he said briefly "Peggy,
how you hae grown up"
'Hae 1?" she laughed "nd so
hae you, about two feet higher, and
you went to West Point after all?"
"Yes, father insisted"
"o you like the nrmy?"
"Oh, yes, when we see actie ser
"Then you hae seen actie serice
In the Spanishmerican war? Oh,
tell me about it!"
Roberts laughed "I will some time,"
he said "I will tell you anything you
ask, but let's talk about you now
Where hae you been all these years?"
 "School and college and around at
places"
"That means traeling, I suppose, yet
you neer isited West Point?"
"Neer I didn't know that you were
there, that you had gone back You
know you said" —
"Vc"s, I said seeral things about that
time You haen't forgotten then?"
"Forgotten? Oh, ick, I couldn't
forget! Neer! Wasn't it dreadful?"
"It was rather a bad mess, but we—
at least I— showed remarkably good
taste, though you weren't as beautiful
then as you are now"
"I can't snub you for that," the girt
said, with carefully lowered lashes
"It sounds genuine You always were
thoroughly genuine, ick"
"Yes, I was in earnest then," he
said, smiling "You were my first
sweetheart" He laughed aloud "My,
how you cried when the minister re
fused to marry us! I flattered myself
that you were disappointed, but it real
ly was your pride, you poor little girl"
He regarded the poor little girl's
blushing face with tender affection
"I think that the old minister was
the sweetest man I eer met He knew
that we were eloping How gentle he
was and tactful I hae always
thought of him with thankfulness akin
to loe"
"I thought he was a regular old
donkey, but it appears that I am the
only one who was in real earnest" he
said tentatiely
Peggy laughed "o you remember
my high heeled boots?" she asked, Ijr
noring his remark
"Oh, don't I, though! You trippci
and I had the delirious joy of catching
you in my arms But do you remehiriei
Uow I saed money? I'e roared oor

my wi'lness more than once • Yon
know I had only $25 to my name, and
I salfl that carriages were too slow and
t!iPersonalt we would much bettor take a car"
"I bPersonalid forgotten that," I'eggy said,
'but 1 remember how fighting mad you
were when papa rushed in You stood
between him and me and said, 'Sir,
your daughter has consented to be
come my wife!' Oh, ick, wasn't It
funny?"
"Yes," he said slowly "Sometimes
It seems funny to me and sometimes it
seems strangely tragic That we were
such babies is the only saing fact
Toor kids!" He sighed and turned his
eyes from the girl's face "I suppose
you're engaged now?" he said • >_
"How does that happen?"
She shook her head "nd your?,
she said
"Engaged? No, indeed I neer saw
but one loable girl in my life"
"nd she wouldn't many you?"
"She wouldn't There will neer be
another I lost track of her"
"But you didn't forget her?" the girl
asked softly
"I neer forgot her for a minute
But It's too late to find her now She
doesn't care for me anyway"
"Oh, ick, don't say that ny girl
ought to care for you Just the fact
that you stay true to ' one woman
should be enough on't gie up and
spoil it"
"Will you gie me a recommenda'
tion?" he asked, smiling "Say that
none of my relaties were hanged or
something like that?"
"I could say much better things It
is beautiful that you want to find her
I like it, ick nd I think the girl
will like it"
Roberts looked deep into her eyes,
but he saw no self consciousness He
forgot what he had read many times,
that women are cleer actresses
"Your adice may be good," he said
after a few moments of silence "But
what would you hae said yourself,
Peggy, If I had huntedyou up and had
told you about caring for you? The
girl is ery much like you What would
you hae said?"
"Oh, that's silly, ick," sho said
quickly "You know you wouldn't"
She looked past Roberts and frowned
uneasily "It's going to rain," she mur
mured, "and I'm cold"
"Oh, I suppose so," ick said gloom
ily "She'd say that too That's why
I didn't hunt her up"
"But it's going to rain There, I felt
a drop, ick"
Roberts rose quickly and looked to
ward the fort
"By Joe, it is, Peggy I didn't no
tice those clouds Here comes the
wind We'll hae to stand under those
trees till it blows oer I'm mighty
sorry that I didn't notice it" He
slipped off his coat and wrapped it
about the girl's shoulders
"Oh, don't, ick," she protested
"Please You know girls don't take
cold as easily as men They're used
to exposure"
They ran to a clump of trees and
Roberts made the girl kneel by a low
stone wall that ran at the side of the
road
"ick, I don't want you to stand
there in the rain Please take your
coat"
He smiled down at her "What a
foolish little girl it is," he said "But
I'll kneel beside you if you think it's
safe"
She raised her questioning eyes to
his "I wish you would," she said
"I don't like to hae you take such a
terrible risk, and just to protect me,
when I can keep dry in this corner as
well as not"
Roberts  dropped to his knees and
leaned ngalnst the wall
"Peggy," he said, "Just to protect
you I would gie my life idn't you
know that, dear?" There was tender
ness in his tone and coniction He
spoke not passionately, but truly
Peggy locked her hands tightly to
gether and her lips quiered lt seemed
a long time before she could', raise her
eyes Then she met the earnest ques
tioning gaze of the man
"You may," she said simply "ick,
you may"
The ruin had ceased and the^clouds
had hurried n their way towatrd the
east when Peggy and Captain Roberts
entered the reseration and were! met
by the joial colonel
"Well," he said heartily, "Peggy
I'e had a searching party out' for you,
but I just heard that you two were
coming up the rier road This looks
bad, bad Why, we began to think
you and the captain, here, had eloped"
Peggy flushed and glanced nt the
younger man Then she smiled at" the
colonel
"We did," she said demurely, "six
years ago"
