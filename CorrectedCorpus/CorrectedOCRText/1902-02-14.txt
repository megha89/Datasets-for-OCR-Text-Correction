THE MAGIC NUMBER
A Suggestion by the Cynic That Set
the Others Thinking;
"I often hear of the magic number,"
said some one "What number Is it?"
"Why, nine, of course," replied some
one else "Tliere are nine muses, you
know, and you talk of a nine days'
wonder Then you bowl at ninepins,
and a cat has nine lies" 
"Nonsense!" broke in another  ''Se
en is the magic number Seenth
heaen, don't you know, and all that;
seen colors In the rainbow, seen
days in the week, seenth son of a
seenth son— great fellow— and"— |
"Tush, tush!" remarked a third
"Fie's the number you mean  A
man has fie fingers on his hand and
fie toes on his foot, and be has fie

"Three is undoubtedly the magic
number," interrupted another, "because
people gie three cheers, and Jonah
was inside a whale three days I and
three nights, and if at first you don't
succeed, try, try again— three times,
you see!"
This was receied with some con
tempt by the company, and a soulful
youth gushed outPersonal
"Two, oh, two is the magic num
ber — oneself and one other, the adored
one— Just two!"
A hard featured indiidual, who bad
been listening to the conersation hith
erto unmoed, here remarked in a
harsh \olcePersonal
"The magic number is number one
in this world, and If you want to suePersonal

Bp-otUm of Genlm
A writer in the London Standard de
clares tbe idea that genlue is usually
modest to be a popular delusion On
the contrary, he alleges egotism to be
the ery essence of true genius and
quotes many amusing examples
When Wordsworth, Southey and
Coleridge were walking together and
Coleridge remarked that tbe day was
so fine "it might hae been ordered for
three poets," the gentle Wordsworth
promptly exclaimedPersonal "Three poets!
Who are tho otli er two ?" 
Disraeli, then a mere youth, wrote to
his sister that ho had heard Macaulay,
Shell and Grant speak, "but between
•ourseles I could floor them 'all," And
again he said, "When I want to read a
good book, I write one"
Our own Joaquin Miller wrote to
Walt WhitmanPersonal "You and I are oer
the head of the rabble We know we
aro great, and If other people don't
know It It is their own fault"
It was President Grant who, being
told that a certain senator, an admit
ted genius who was ery hostile to
him, did not beliee the Bible, ex
pressed his estimate of the senator's*
egotism by rejoiningPersonal "Why should he?
He didn't write it, you know"— New

Buying a Ruor
"I need a new razor," said the man
who shaes himself
"Better let mo get It for yon," sug
gested the reformed barber, who, now
that he Is a trolley car conductor,
regards himself as a distinguished
member of society "All cutlery stores
are filled with razors of the class
known as 'dead ones' When a barber
buys a razor, he takes it with the un
derstanding that he is to try it out, and
if it doesn't work well he takes It back
and gets another one, keeping this up
until he gets one that suits him Buy-
Ing a razor, you know, is a lottery In
which tho prizes' are" few and far be
tween When the ordinary ciUzen goes
to a cutlery store, he picks oufVhat he
thinks Is a good razor, pays for It and
takes his chances He picks one out,
tool from the bunch of 'dead ones' that
barbers hae tried and found wanting'
That's why I adise you to let me get
It for you Then if you don't like it I
can keep exchanging it until you get a
good one They needn't know I'e quit
Ithe business"— Philadelphia Record
The Woolsack
- Back during the time of Queen Eliza
beth an act of parliament was passed
prohibiting the exportation of wool
This product was one of the great
sources of the natural wealth of Eng
land at that time, and in accordance
with the economic notions of the age
the authorities attempted to keep it In
the country, Imagining that if it went
abroad, een though something more
aluable or desirable were exchanged
for it, the country would be the poorer
In order to hold the Importance of
this commodity before the minds of the
national legislators woolsacks were
placed in the house of lords, where the
Judges sat Hence the lord chancellor,
who presides oer the house of lords,
"sits on the woolsack" The woolsack,
according to a printed description, is a
"large square bag of wool without
back or arms and coered with red
cloth"
"Faints"
Fusel oil, or "faints," as It Is com
monly called about the distilleries In
England, according to the London Lan
cet, Is a primary nmji alcohol mixed
with primary and secondary propyl al
cohols In England it can be obtained
gratis at some distilleries It is used
locally as an external application for
rheumatism It Is obtained from fer
mented grain or potatoes by continu
ing the process of distillation after the
ordinary spirit has all "come oer" It
Is an oily liquid, with a burning, acrid
taste and an odor', said to resemble
Jargonelle pear It has intoxicating
and poisonous properties considerably
more powerful than ordinary spirits
Hast Gie a Horseshoe
An old manorial rite exists at Oak
ham, In Rutlandshire, England, where
eery peer of the realm Is bound the
first time he enters the town to present
a horseshoe to be nailed on the old por
tal, which is well nigh coered with
these tributes It is said that In case
any contumacious peer should refuse
to pay this tax the authorities hae a
right to stop his carriage and ley
blackmail by unshoeing one of the
horses To aert so serious an annoy
ance the tribute shoe is generally ready,
some being of enormous size and In

Harsh Neighbors
"How do you like your neighbors?"
 "Not a bit," said the woman who was
tying a little boy's hat on "You see,
they don't like children"
"How do you know?"
"They hurt Reginald's feelings dread

She doesn't go to her clubs and eu
chres half as much as she did Peo
ple used to say this charming woman
spent most of her time at these gather
ings One day she called on a dear
friend to reproe her for her slacken
ing interest in the club I beliee it
was a club^or reforming the gas met
er or something— anyhow it was a re
form affairPersonal
"Look here, Lizzie," said the enthu
siast, "why on earth don't you come
to the meetings? Here you are paying
your dues and ueer showing up You
owe it to the club to take an interest
in the work"
"But  I can't come," explained her
friend "There's the baby, and Henry
doesn't come home sometimes till late,
and supper must wait, and if he wants
to go out I can't go away and leae
the children I would worry myself
to death"
"Well, I must say Henry Is inconsid
erate," said the caller "Why, there's
my -husband and children too They,
gie me no trouble Eery tlruo I want
to go to the club Charlie says he will
be glad to stay at home with Bridget
and keep an eye on things till I come
back He neer objects"
"Maybe," retorted the amiable host
ess, "If I had a housegirl as handsome
and young as Bridget Henry would be
glad to stay at home, too, but mine Is
black and goes home at nights"

Length of Dreams
Three physicians were discussing the
matter of the length of dreams a day
or two ago when one of them related a
strange experience
"Yesterday afternoon," ho said, "I
called to see a patient, and much to
my satisfaction, I found him sleeping
soundly I sat by his bed, felt of his
pulse without disturbing him and wait
ed for him to awaken - After a few
minutes a junk dealer's cart with dis
cordant ringing bells turned into the
street, and as their first tones reached
us my patient opened his eyes
" 'Doctor' he said, 'I'm glad to see
you and awfully glad that you woke
me, for I hae been tortured by a most
distressing dream that must hae last
ed for seeral hours I dreamed that I
was sick, as I am, and that my boy
came Into the room with a string of
most horribly sounding sleighbells and
rang them in my ears, while I hadn't
power to moe or speak to him I suf
fered tortures for what appeared to be
an Interminable time I'm so glad you
woke me'
"The ringing of those bells for one

Hairbrushes
No amount of washing of the hair
will keep it clean if dirty brushes are
used, yet persons otherwise fairly neat
are careless in this respect A special
ist Bays that " hairbrushes should be
washed once a week and, if used on
hair In which there is much dandruff,
twice a week is not too often The
brushes should be washed in cold, not
hot, waterj to which cloudy ammonia
has been added in the proportion of a
scant tablcspoonful to a quart of wa
ter Care should bo taken not to wet
the baaks of the brushes, and when
washed and rinsed— a good way to
rinse them properly Is to use a shower
spray on them — they should be put on
edge to the air to dry Dress combs,
too, should be frequently cleaned, a

The Discoery of Borax In Death
Valley by Aaron Winters
The greatest discoery of borax In
the United* States was made In the ter
ribly hot region known as Death al
ley and In a most romantic way The
Chicago Record tells the story
In 1880 Aaron Winters lied with his
wife, Rosle, In a gulch known as Ash
Meadows, not far from the mouth of
Death alley Personal He was so fond of
big wife that he would not allow her to
be long absent from him, although
their little hut on the side of the moun
tain was a hundred miles from the
nearest neighbor In a wild, rugged,
forsaken country
One day a desert tramp came along
and spent the night at the Winters
home He told the hunter about the
borax deposits of Neada When he
went away, Winters thought that he
had seen deposits of the same kind on
his explorations Into Death alley
Accordingly he and his wife went to
gether to make the search, haing pre
iously proided themseles with cer
tain t<wt chemicals, which when com
bined with borax and ignited would
produce a green flame
Haing procured a piece of the sub
stance which he belieed to be borax,
Winters and his wife "waited for night
fall to make the test How would It
burn?
For years they had lied like Plutes

Joreln de Rochefort, who published

"While we were walking about the
town (Worcester) he asked me If It was
the custom In France as hi England
that when the children went to school
they carried in their satchel with their
books a pipe of tobacco, which their
mothers took care to fill early In the
morning, it sering them Instead of
breakfast, and that at the accustomed
hour eery one laid aside his book to
light his pipe, the master smoking with
them and teaching them how to hold
their pipes and draw in the tobacco"
In England at the time of the great
plague It was reported that no one li

the disease This caused a great de

diary, "I remember that I heard for
merly Tom Rogers, who was yeoman
beadle, say that when he was a school
boy at Eton that year when the plague
raged all the boys of that school were
obliged to smoke eery morning and
that he was neer whipped so much In
his life as he was one morning for not
smoking"

THOSE FEES FOR LEGAL SER-
We hae taken the trouble to ex
amine more closely into the matter
of the claims of W J McGee, as
special counsel in the case of Thomas
Conlon, trustee, et al, s C L Cul
bert, county auditor It will be re
membered that mandamus proceed
ings were started to compel the
county auditor to add such an
amount to the tax ley for school
purposes as would, when added to
the ley already made by the board,
make up the sum of $6 per census
child The further we look into
 this affair, the more its remarkable
and peculiar features come to the
front Indeed, the whole history of
the case seres to show how uncere
moniously the proisions of law are
ignored by officers whose duty it is
to see that they are respected Tbe
mandamus suit was commenced in
the superior court September 29,
1899 The district attorney is the
legal adiser of all county officials,
and it is his business to defend all
suits in which the county is made a
party, and wherein county money is
inoled The district attorney,
howeer, says he was not consulted
on the subject of taking charge of
this case The auditor, seemingly
on his own motion and without first
securing the sanction of the board
of superisors, employed W J Mc-
Gee to represent him in the action
There was no time of course, to ap
peal to the superisors for a special
attorney before the superior court
It would seem to us therefore the
auditor in employing other than the
district attorney, assumed the re
sponsibility for the payment of
special counsel himself It certainly
cannot be contended that any coun
ty officer may hire any attorney
whom he pleases, and shoulder the
payment of his fee upon the public
treasury In October, 1899, the
writ of mandate was dismissed by
the superior court, the auditor
thereby winning the suit Then
followed a long pause in the pro
ceedings Nothing more was heard
of the case until April, 1900, when
the following bill was presented to
the board of superisors by Mr
McGeePersonal
To legal serices rendered
and expenses incurred in Jack
son school district s C L
Culbert, auditor — superior and
supreme courts $ 200 00
< Money paid in aboe case to as
sistant counsel 50 00
This is the first intimation con
eyed to the board of superisors, so
far as we caa ascertain from the
minutes that such a case was pend
ing against the county No steps
had been taken to appeal the suit to
the supreme court No sanction of
the employment of special counsel
had been made by the superisors up
to this time Mr McGee was about
to start for a tour of Europe Of
course no serices had been render
ed in the supreme court, because the
suit had not reached that tribunal
The only way we can understand
this is that the higher court was in
cluded, so that in case an appeal
was taken the fee was to be inclusie
of serices in that court also The
district attorney — who by the way
did not indorse this first bill as a
legal claim — says this was his clear
understanding of the matter at that
time The bill was passed by unani
mous ote of the board Nothing
further was heard of the case until
February 5, 1901, when C L Cul
bert, as county auditor, notified the
board that he had employed Mr
McGree to represent him in the case;
and that plaintiffs haing appealed,
he had requested Mr McGee to rep
resent him in the higher court, and
asked the superisors to ratify his
action in the employment of Mr
McGee, so that the county would be
responsible for his fee From this
we are forced to the conclusion that
although a fee of $250 for serices in
superior and supreme courts had
been paid ten months before, there
had been no employment of a special
attorney by the county up to this
time It is difficult to understand
what fee the county was asked to be
come responsible for Was it the
one already irregularly paid, or one
to be demanded thereafter? No
wonder that first bill lacked the en
dorsement of the district attorney
as a legal claim The board, how
eer, without a dissenting oice,
ratified the action of the auditor in
his selection of counsel outside of the
district attorney £,  -^
Personal The next heard of the matter was
in June, 1901, when Mr McGee ap
peared before the board and report
ed that be had argued the case before
the supreme court on the 15th of
The final step was referred to last
week, when the second bill of $500
for serices in tbe supreme court —
already specified and paid for before
hand in the first bill — was presented
and allowed
Tn regard to this claim- we hae
been informed by the district at
torney that he told the board of
ficially and priately that it was an
improper demand, and should not be
allowed
We cheerfulty gie place to the
communication of Mr McGee which
appears in another column, and
which presents his ersion of the
matter We can see nothing there
in to cause us to modify our iews
already expressed We are as much
in the dark as eer regarding the
payment of a fee both before and
after employment by the county
We cannot understand what serices
were rendered for the respondent
in the supreme court prior to April,
1900, when the superisors were not
notified that an appeal had been
taken until February, 1901 We fail
to see that a special attorney, een
when regulary employed by a coun
ty, has any authority by irtue of
such employment to hire additional
counsel, and thereby saddle an ad
ditional fee upon the public treas
ury We hae failed to mention a
number of the sidelights referred to
by our correspondent, for the reason
that in our opinion they are not
material to the issue Finally, we
may remark, that from beginning to
end of this school tax case one all
important fact seems to hae been
oerlooked by all the parties who
aided in piling up this double
shotted cost bill for legal serices —
namely, that Amador county em
ploys a district attorney at $1800 per
year to look after its legal business
Tf this one liing fact is indelibly
impressed upon tbe minds of county
officials for their future guidance,
this entilation of an unpleasant
subject will not hae been in ain
Richahd Webb olunteers the
statement that at the age of sixteen
years he was ordained as a preacher
— Dispatch
Our cotemporary seems to be so
constituted tnat he cannot tell the
truth The aboe contains two bare
faced falsehoods We defy him to
produce any statement made in the
Ledger that will sustain his preert
ed assertion In the first place we
neer olunteered any statemeut on
the subject If the truth-inflationist
of the Dispatch does not know the
difference between an ordained and
unordained preacher, he had better
quit airing his ignorance The ef
fect of misrepresentation is equally
bad whether it springs from ignor
ance or depraity But when, as in
the aboe instance, the truth is
placed before him, and he wilfully
distorts it into a lie, he thereby
brands himself as a moral outlaw
The lone board of trade is agi
tating for the appointment of a
health officer for lone Just why
lone is entitled to a health officer
more than any other town in the
county does not appear If the al
ley town needs a special officer to
look after its sanitary affairs at the
expense of the entire county, the
board of superisors would be in
justice bound to grant the same pro
tection to at least fie other towns,
namely, Jackson, Sutter Creek,
Amador City, Plymouth and Vol
cano That method of trying to
scatter health germs — or dissipate
disease germs — has been tried and
oted a dismal failure The truth
is there is no law authorizing the
board of superisors to appoint a
health officer for any particular
town, in the absence of a general
health officer for the county With
a county health officer, assistants
might in cases of emergency be ap
pointed at arious points, but not
otherwise
$250 00
The agrancy law, in its most
objectionable features at least, has
been declared unconstitutional The
idea that a man who is found roam
ing from place to place, and haing
no isible means of support, is a
proper subject to be landed in jail,
has proed a lucratie proposition
for constables and justices, and a
costly one for many county treas
uries To be an idle roamer is not
a ery honorable profession, but it
is not in itself a criminal one It
is a source of satisfaction that this
odious law, so out of joint with the
spirit of our free institutions, has
been knocked out by the courts

THE AMAT>OR LEDGERPersonal JACKSON » uAIiTTORNIA TTtIPAY, FEBRUARYS 14, 1902
COMMUNICATION
JACKSON, CAL., Feb- 8, 1902
,To the editor of the Amador Ledgor,
SirPersonal—  -  "
 In the issue of your paper of
February 7th you do the board of
superisors and myself an injustice,
and in your article entitled "Claim for
Legal Serices," you did not fully and
fairly publish the true facts
The first claim presented on April 2,
1900, for $250, was for legal* sericos
rendered, expenses incurred, and
money paid associate counsel up to that
date These sorices included the trial
of the case in the superior court, and
some preliminary serices in the su
preme court, and also expenses incurred
in a trip from Jackson to San Fran
cisco All I indiidually reseied out
of this $250 was about $150 There
after the case went through the su
preme court, coering a period of
nearly two years, and a subsequent
bill of $500 was presented for serices
rendered from April 2, 1900, up to the
decision of the case, to wit, the latter
part of 1901 ,  ;i
You failed to state in your article
that W Q Willis of the law firm "of
Freeman & Willis, who were attorneys
for the school districts, testified before
the board that under the contract they
had the firm of Freeman & Willis
would hae receied from their clients
the sum of $1500 had they won tho case
You also failed to state that the board
of superisors called^n Hon John F
Dais and Hon A Caminetti, and
asked them if in their judgment the
charge was a fair one, and they both
replied in the affirmatie You also
failed to state that the reason of the
offer on my part to defend other suits
growing out of the same matter free of
charge was because Judge Dais sug
gested to the board that it was barely
possible another suit might be brought,
and although the attorneys for the
school districts said that the matter
was ended, at the request of the board
I agreed to make no further charges if
there was any further litigation
You also failed to state that the Dis
trict Attorney was present throughout
tho hearing, and that before tlio board
passed the claim they asked his adice
on the same
You also failed to slate that in ex
planation of the employment of assist
ant counsel by myself I was authorized
so to do by Superisors Dwyer and
Brinn
You intimate in your article that
when the first bill was rendered it was
"supposed" to be in full, and yet the
bill as published by you shows on its
face that it was for serices and ex
penses up to that time, to wit, April 2,
1900, as the wording of the bi'l is— "To
serices rendered and expenses in
curred "' You say, "there is nothing
in the bill to show that it is merely a
partial settlement;" I submit there, is
nothing in the bill to indicate that it
was to coer future serices and ex
penses * Both bills were fully explained
to the board at the meetings in Decem
ber, January, and February, and the
board had the latter bill under consid
eration for three months, and under
stood it thoroughly, and knew the* bill
was withdrawn in December and Jan
uary under the statement that it would
be presented again The bill was with
drawn by me to aoid its being laid
oer at" the December and January
meetings, the board being desirous of
further time to consider it
You pay that apparently the same
ground was coered by both claims,
but in this you are mistaken as prei
ously shown in this communication
You say that the name of the special
counsel does not appear on the bill, but
I repeatedly stated his name — Mr F
S Brittain, attorney for the Hibernia
Saings and Loan Society of San Fran
cisco—to the board, and, if I mistake
not, in your presence
Finally you fail to state in explana
tion of the claim that the litigation in
oled a large amount of money, em
bracing for the three years nearly $20-,
000, which was saed to the taxpayers
of the county, and when the case was
in the supreme court I agreed with tho
superisors that if the school districts
won tho case I would make no charge
for my serices in the supremo court,
but, if on the other hand, the suit was
decided in faor of the Auditor, I would
ask for a fair fee
You intimate that the warrant was
cashed at once because I was fearful
some one would protest against its pay
ment, but in answer to this let me say
that if you or any other taxpayer want
to contest the payment at your own ex
pense and not at the county's I will
freely return tho money to tho treas
urer so that you may hao an oppor
tunity to doso
Very respectfully yours,

District ' Attorney's Opinion
The district attorney has, at the re
quest, of C L Culbert, county clerk,
gien the following opinion in writing
in reference to certain points raised by
the calling of a special election in Sut
ter Creek to ote on the question of in
corporation The gist of the opinion
is stated as followsPersonal
Any person may ote at said election,
whose name appears upon the great
register used at the last general elec
tion, and all persons who hae resided
in the state one year, in the county 90
days and within the"exterior boundaries
of tho proposed corporation for 30 days
next preceding the date of said election
and who hae been enrolled upon tbe
new register now in progress, 15 days
before election
The more fact that the board of
superisors canceled tho great registor
used at the last goneral election does
not cancel it; whore a new registration
pursuant to law is not completed in
point of timo sulliciont to permit of its
use at a special election or the next en
suing election, then tho registor used
at the' last general election in any coun
ty in the state may be used
' The clerk must, before the day of
election, transmit and cause to bo de
liered to tho board of election in each
precinct, a book of registration which
shall constitute the register to bo used
at such election; ho shall also cause to
be deliered at the same time fi o copies
of the index to said book
There is ample timo for eery person
who desires to oto at said election to
bocorao enrolled upon the new register,
who is not enrolled upon the old reg
ister, as you terra it, and I hereby ad
ise you that it is your duty to post
notices of the purport of this opinion
in the town of Setter Creek, and ap
point sutlicient deputies in said town so
that each and eery porson residing
thoreiu may bee jme enrolled upon the
register, and which will enable thorn to
ote at said election

hold upon him He did not run away
from home, as some boys foolishly do
when the idea of being self-supporting
seizes them But he communicated
his wishes to his father, and he thought,
all things considered, that it would be
bettor for the boy to carry out his
plans So Wednesday of last week he
left the parental roof with a small
bundle of his belongings He made
his way to Sacramento county, and a
few days after his father receied a

That Pipe Line
At a meeting held In lone last week
it was decided to oppose the dismantling
of the plant for sprinkling the lone
road, and selling the pipe and water
tanks What use is the material where
it lies? Was the experience of last
season in the sprinkling business of
such a character as to justify its con
tinuance at public expense next sum
mer? If the pipe remains where it is,
it will be fit for nothing but junk in
another year or so The money that
might be realized from it now might be
of some serice in the permanont im
proement of the roadway The pipe
and sprinkling plant belong to Amador
county The fact that priato citizens
contributed toward the purchase does
not change the ownership, nor gie the
contributors any more say in its dis
posal than any other taxpayers The
board of superisors ought to take
some action To allow it to rot in the
ground is anything but a business
proposition

school with their faces coered with
blotches The result Is that the
disease— which, whether smallpox or
not, is certainly of a highly contagious
nature— has had a free field in which
to spread It is estimated that at least
25 cases exist in our sister town It
has obtained headway in exactly the
same way as the outbreak in Jackson
about two years ago The symptoms
had certain well-defined characteristics
of smallpox, but then again those
afflicted felt little the worse for the
disease, attending school and joining in
play as usual, so that the people were
naturally loath to beliee that the
much dreaded smallpox had taken
quarters in their midst The local
physicians, who were attending the
patients, were opposed to that opinion
District Attorney Vicini was in Sut
ter Creek Tuesday afternoon, and the
prealence of the malady was brought
to his attention By this time seeral
adults were Buffering from the com
plaint, including Mrs Morris, who suc
ceeded to Mrs Mails' business, and a
Mrs Williams Tho district attorney
thereupon called upon Dr Lewis, who
was the attending physician in most of
the cases, and told him of the reports
that were afloat It was then decided
to send for Dr Gall of Jackson, who
had much experience in such cases dur
ing the outbreak here He went oer
to Sutter Crook, and upon isiting one
of the cases, unhesitatingly pronounced
it smallpox— the same that preailed
at the county seat two years ago Still
the local doctors would not accept this
erdict, Dr Goodman strongly pro
testing against such a diagnosis
Dr E E Endicott, who was health
officer when the county seat was isited,
was summoned, and he said it was
smallpox
The judgment of two physicians who
had passed through the ordeal at the
county seat, ought to hae settled the
question, but it did not
Finally the district attorney docided
to appeal to tho state authorities He
called up W P Matthews, secretary of
the stale board of health, and request
ed that a medical officer of tho state be
sent to Sutter Creek to determine the
nature of the outbreak He was ex
pected to arrie in Suttor Creek last
night His erdict will bo taken as de
cisie In the meantime, no rigid
quarantine was established The pre
caution was taken to preent thoso suf
fering from the eruption from attend
ing school; Mrs Morris' business was
closed temporarily, but no guards were
appointed to watch tho infected places
Tho laundry wagons from Sutter
Creek isit the neighboring towns de
liering and gathering up clothing the
same as usual
The preailing opinion of those who
hae had experience in such cases, is
that a mild type of smallpox — such as
has appeared more or less in almos t
eery part of the state— exists in Sut
ter Creek Nearly all the casos are
simple and compariticly harmless
types of arioloid Two casos of con
fluent smallpox are said to exist There
is no need to be alarmed, howeer
With ordinary precautions, the epi
demic will soon disappear, as it has in
eery place as soon as protectie
measures hae been taken The cir
cumstances do not call for any harsh
or seere restrictie methods against
the afflicted town We hae been in
the same predicament not so long ago,
and while it is" wise to -take all reason
able precautions to guard against ex
posure, still there is not the slightest
necessity for the interruption of eery
day business relations with Sutter
Creek
Dr Hanna, of Sacramento, a repre
sentatie of tho state board of heath,
arried in Sutter Creek last night, and
pronounced the disease smallpox This
is decisie of the whole matter An
effectio quarantine has been estab
lished, and eerything done to confine
the contagion within its present limits 1 '
The fling at the Jackson doctors con
tained in the Amador Record is ery
untimely and uncalled-for The county
seat physicians hae learned to know
smallpox when they soe it Sutter
Creek medicos will probably know it
hereafter

A bad break occurred on the line of
the old canal below the Petty reseroir
last Sunday The managers started
to fill the new reseroir, known as the
Petty reseroir This is a small affair,
compared with the Taboaud reseroir,
being 1000 feet long, 60 feet wide, and
15 feet deep The work of filling an
earth reseroir has to bo ory care
fully and gradually done Seepage
and breaks incident thereto are not
uncommon occurrences in connection
with now reseroirs, and it is usual to
raise tho water ery gradually at first
to guard against those mishaps Tho
banks of the reseroir at Petty did not
gie way in any place, but the seepage
therefrom weakened a portion of the
old Amador canal below, filling it up
for a distance of 60 feet and also causing
quite a break A force of men was at

pool, England, September 19, 1828, and
died at the home of her daughter, Mrs
Augusta Fleming, in Jackson, Feb

notice spent most of her girlhood days
in London, England At 18 years of
age she came to America in a sailing
essel The journey was accomplished
in about 6 months' time She came by
the way of the Gulf of Mexico to New
Orleans, and then up the Mississippi
rier to St Louis In 1858 she, in
company with others, crossed the
western plains and located at Virginia
City, Neada Fie months' time was
consumed in this oerland ox-team
route Indians were numerous and
hostile at this time in the different sec
tions through which these emigrants
were obliged to trael After 4 years'
sojourn in Virginia City, she moed to
California and lied for the most part
in Sacramento, Tuolumne, Alpine and
Amador counties In the year 1850,
she married John F Dais, who died
in 1864 By this union one son, who
died in childhood, and one daughter,
Mrs A Fleming of Jackson, were born'
unto them Sho married her second
husband, Tom Bastian, brother of
James B Bastian of Amador City, in
1868 He was accidentally killed after
scarcely one year of a happy married

Mr M J Nightingale of Oakdale, Cal
At the age of 12 Mrs Nightingale
gae her heart to God, and since that
time has beon a firm and deout be
lieer in salation through Jesus Christ
Her beneolent heart sympathized with
and her willing hands were extended
in aid to the suffering and destitute
Want went smiling from her door She
sacrificed her owa comforts in order to
aid others whom she felt were less
fortunate than herself Her interest
and deotion in her own family circle
was beautiful and wholesome The
spirit of the Master was practically
demonstrated in her life work In her
last sickness she was a great sufferer
She felt that if it was God's will, she
would like to enter her heaenly home
"I hae a desire to depart and to be
withiChrist, which is far better" She
said to her daughter, whose gentle
ministrations were in abundance, ' 'You
are praying that I may get well Pray
that I may pass away and be at rest ' '
Notwithstanding the efforts of trained
nurses, and skillful physicians, and the
ministrations of friends, she quietly
and peacefully passed to the inner cir
cle of loed ones gone before

A TRIP TO ALASKA
Going Through the Ice
On the 15th of June, 1901, the S S
Valencia steamed put of Unalaska har
bor for the north For one week prior
thereto, we had laid still at the wharf
at the aforementioned place, as the in
surance companies in which the Va
lencia and her cargo were insured had
forbidden in their stipulations for the
boat to proceed northward before the
15th of June as a precaution against
the danger of the ice they knew full
well would be ahead For one day and
night after leaing Unalaska we
steamed through the cold, blue, Iceless
sea that dashed with a continuous
splashing sound against the iron sides
of the Valencia Not an object of in
terest had we seen up to this time, and
only the broad expanse of a restless
ocean standing out with dull monotony
before our iew Occasionally a whale
would send a shaft of spouting water
far Into the air, and all eyes would be
turned in that direction Only a
glimpse of the whale could be seen as
he threw his tall upward and died
beneath the dark blue waes of the sea,
and was seen no more The tireless
seagull followed the essel continually,
feeding from the garbage thrown from
the essel; and when tired they lit with
half folded wings upon the crest of a
rolling wae, touching the water with
their feet and seemed to be walking
upon it, then suddenly their wings
would drop to their sides and with the
lightness and ease of a cork in a pail of
disturbed well water would be carried
along by the waes '";-" ~
On the 17th of June, just as the - sun
was rising through the cold dim mist
that hung like a shadow before it, I
came out on deck and looked toward
the north A sea of floating ice stood
before the ision A solitary iceberg,
half as big as a block in a city, glided,
suail like, a few hundred feet past us
A cerulean tint of azury blue appeared
to be painted at its base, and as the sea
gently dashed upon it, seemed that
some inisible artist was painting upon
it for the gaze of the gods The cor
rugated surface of the iceberg sparkled
with the glitter of a diadem, and sent
a thrill of ecstatic delight through me
The Valencia was slowly approaching
the great ice floe ahead I climbed up
behind the smoke stack to get a better
iew of the immensity of ice that stood
like a great ocean itself before us Ice!
ice! ice! masses large enough in body to
hae acted as a base for the city of San
Francisco The ocean was calm and
the great mass moed slowly onward,
bobbing, nodding, and bathing itself
in the cold blue waes of the rippling
sea Upon its uneen surface seemed
to spring spires, domes, pyramids,
turrets, and ancient citadels The
captain in the lookout 60 or 80 feet
aboe us was critically sureying the
sea of floating ice with his glass The
Valencia steamed up within a half
mile of the floe when her engines were
stopped, and we awaited the floe to
show an opening We dare, not ap
proach too close lost the great mass
might jam or wrench the essel The
trip to the Valencia was not a new one
as she belonged to the Pacific Whaling
Company and had faced the ice more
than once before After an hour or so
a break appeared in the ice, and be
yond it was a space of open sea The
engines on the essel were started up,
and we ran at full speed for the open
ing Detached pieces of ice occasionally
struck the essel with a rasping, grat
ing sound, then thrown back by the
momentum of the essel, moed on
ward after the great floo as a weary
migratory bird following a great flock
Wo again stopped, after passing
through the opening, for beyond us
was another great body of moing ice
The captain was cautious and wary,
and watched with solicitude and eager
ness as a prize fighter would for an
opening, and wheneer one showed
itself the engines were put at full speed,
dodging here and there among the
great detached floating icebergs of the
sea Therefore we stopped, we moed,
we moed, and we stopped until the
impatient passengers were eager for
the boat to buck the ice One day
while waiting for a chance to proceed,
a little boy of 5 or 6 summers ap
proached the captain, and raising his
little face to that of the officer's, said
in an emphatic, boyish tonePersonal "Captain,
are we stuck in the mud?" Had the
interlocutor been aught but a child or
a woman he would hae turned upon
him with a snarl, and shouted in
stentorian tones, "Go to " but as
it was he turned, and with a bland
smile walked slowly away One day
while lying still off the coast of St
Lawrence island, some one shouted,
"See the Esquimaux!" Sure enough,
two Esquimaux Indians in their deli
cate cigar shaped kiacks were coming
toward us When they were close to
the essel's side they halooed,
"Powder, whiskey," but the boat
officials concluded that powder and
whiskey were antagonistic agencies in
the hands of an Indian and refused
their request On tho morning of the
19th of J uno the clear cut, blue out
lines of Sledge Island arose bold and
clear out of the ocean The Ice was
now gone The anil mountains back
of Nome arose snow-capped in the dis
tance The shore line, hazy and in
distinct, broke upon tho* ision cold
and dreary, and tho olty of Nome
seemed to be hiding behind the cold
misty haze that hoered o'er the city
The whistle of the Valencia sounded,
the anchor dropped, and the tug
boats answering call told us our
journey was at an end Two hours
afterward we were walking along the
muddy streets, among tho thousands
of strange faces we had neor seen
before Chas S Bell

III* Foot Wai In the Way
A gentlemanly chap riding* In an ele
ated j car permitted j the sight of  a
man's foot In the middle of the aisle to
exasperate him to a most unreasonable
degree Women tripped oer It' Men
stepped oer it A few folk purposely
dragged their feet against It as a bint
But its owner calmly read his paper
and moed not Finally, "1 beg your
pardon, my friend" said the gentleman
ly chap, leaning down, his face sot ami
teeth clinched, "but don't you think; }~ou
are taking up more room than you are
entitled to? Your foot has been In e
ery one's \cay for half an hour I pro
test, slrr*
The man folded his paper, remarking
without the least show of angerPersonal "Ah,
thank you I had not noticed It" With
that he reached down, picked up his
foot, gae It a iolent twist and pushed
It partly under the seat To accomplish
this he had to moe bis body to the
edge of the seat
On discoering that the leg and foot
were wooden our gentlemanlike chap
blushed In confusion, muttered a sort of
apology and hurried off at the next sta
tion, while the car tittered— New York

Very TryingPersonal
 "Johnny," said a proincial grocer to
the new boy, "what kind of butter did
you send oer to the Hendersons?"
"Some of the rolls here," said the new
boy respectfully
"Oh, great Csesar!" groaned the gro
cer "Sent 'em some of that good butter
Just after I hae got 'em down to this
here in the barrel 1 Sent 'em the best
butter in the shop Just as I finish a two
years' course of getting 'em down to
the barrel butter! Gae 'em a taste of
good butter after I hae got 'em to
think this barrel butter was the best in
the world! And still you say you hope
to own a grocer's shop some day! The
taste of that butter you sent 'em will
awaken all their old slumbering desires
for good butter, and I'll hae to work
another two years getting 'em down a
little poorer each time before I get 'em
where there's any profit on 'em again!
You might Just as well put on your
coat and go Groceries ain't your line!"

The Oldest Tree on Earth
The oldest tree on earth, at least as
far as any one knows, Is the boo tree

In the year 288 B O Its great age Is
proed according to historic docu

addsPersonal "To It kings hae dedicated their
dominions in testimony of a belief that
it is a branch of the identical flg tree
under which Buddab reclined at Urum
ela when he underwent his apotheo
slsi" Its leaes are carried away by
pilgrims as relics; but, as it Is too sa
cred to touch with a knife, these leaes
can only be gathered after they hae
