FREAKS OF WEATHER
FOGS, WINS AN STORMS OF VA
RIE PECULIARITIES
The "Willlwau" That Spend* Itself
Upon Tlerra del FuegoThe "Foln"
Wind of Switzerland and the Pe
rocioas "Parga" of Siberia
In mountainous countries, such as
Scotland, a fog usually forms at the
top of a hill and works downward
The cold mountain top, cooling a warm
current of wet air, renders its moisture
isible, and this cold fog, being of low
er temperature than the air below and
therefore heaier, drops gradually to
the alley Colorado, howeer, can
show an exception to this general rule
There in winter the frost on the low
ground is so intense that a fog often
forms in the alleys and works slowly
up the mountain side This is known
by the Indian name of "pogonip" 
 Peru has hundreds of square miles
along its coast of rainless country ' In
this tract rain is neer known to fall
from one century's end to another Yet
the region is not entirely barren of eg
etation Some parts of it, indeed, are
comparatiely fertile This is due to
the extraordinary fogs known as "ga
ruas" They preail eery night from
May to October after a summer that is
sultry and extend up to a leel of 1,200
feet aboe the sea Aboe 1,200 feet
rain falls
The "callna" of Spain is a fog we
may be grateful that we do not hae
It Is a dry,' yellow mist which some
times hides the sun for days at a time
oer ast tracts of country and makes
the sky look as though coered with
leaden gauze
' Another peculiar freak of weather
we must be thankful to escape is the
"wllliwau" Tbls form of storm in
confined to that faroff Island Tlerra del
Fuego The coast is indented with
deep fiords crowned with high moun
tains own from "their gorges drops
the "williwau" A low, hoarse mutter
ing is heard In the distance Sudden
ly, without the least preliminary puff,
a fearful blast of wind drops upon the
sea The water is not raised into
waes, but drien into fine dust For
tunately the shock lasts but ten or
twele seconds, and calm follows at
once, for no essel could stand such a
wind for een half a minute uring
the coming and going of a "willlwau"
the barometer may be watched to drop
a tenth of an inch or more and rise
again at once
Similar in name if not In nature is
the "willy willy" with which Kalgoor
lie gold diggers are acquainted, to their
cost "ust deils," some people call
them Half a dozen may be seen danc
ing harmlessly along oer the desert
when suddenly one will die into the
city and fill all the shop windows in
Hannan street with dust and sand,
blinding eery passerby The "willy
willy" is a thief of the worst kind It
will steal the washing from a line or
the roof from a shed In some parts of
the country wire ropes are anchored
oer the roofs of huts to sae them
from the attacks of these odd little
whirlwinds
; Most people hae heard of the "fohn"
wind of Switzerland, that warm, dry
gale which comes oer the mountains
and in spring will melt two feet of
snow in a day Its cause is most pe
culiar The "fohn" comes from the
south As it strikes the Alps it is wet,
like most gales which hae crossed the
sea, but the south face of the moun
tains receies Its rain, and as it crosses
the summits it Is dry The moing air
current Is also compressed and there
fore dynamically heated As it falls
into the northern alleys in a cataract
of air It gains heat at the rate of half
a degree for eery 100 feet of descent
It usually blows for two or three days,
causing great suffering by its dry heat
and oppression While it lasts the tem
perature is about thirty degrees aboe
the aerage The "chinook" of Brit
ish Columbia and the western side of
the United States is ery similar to the
"fohn"
! England has adopted the American
word "blizzard" for a gale with snow
But the blizzard, howeer, must yield
to the ferocious "buran" of the central
steppes of Asia and the "purga" of
northern Siberia To be caught in gales
such as these means death in a ery
few minutes, howeer warmly clad, for
the ery air becomes unbreathable, so
filled is it with spikes of ice drift
j "Khamsin" Is the hot wind from the
desert which blows out of the Sahara
upon Egypt The word means fifty,
from the idea that It lasts for fifty
days The "khamsin" is terribly hot
and dry and sometimes brings pesti
lence with it
! Red snow we hae all heard of It
is caused by a microscopic infusorial
growth and only occurs in snow that
has lain unmelted for a long time In
Spitzbergen recently green snow has
been noted tinted by similar organisms
I "Gold dust" snow has often been
'seen, but only In spring At one time
it was a mystery how the surface of
'new fallen snow came to be strewn
with a shining yellow deposit Now it
is known to be due to the pollen of
pine trees— Pearson's Weekly
Chicken Pox and Smallpox
I The eruption of chicken pox has an
imperfect resemblance' to that of small
pox, but can neer be mistaken for it
by the experienced eye In smallpox
the eruption of papules first appears
on the forehead, the "papules" always
become "bladders," and the latter al
ways deelop into pustules— that is,
sooner or later their contents get
changed Into pus Then the center of
the pustules undergoes a peculiar sink
ing that in some measure resembles the
'depressions in a cushion or padded
chair where the "buttons" are seen In
chicken pox there is no such uniform
ity of sequence, and the depressions are
absent

'What Makes Things Grow
According to Maurice Springer, a

closely connected with the phenomenon
called osmosis— that is, molecular pres
sure due to differences of density in
adjacent liquid masses Such molecu
lar pressure in the cells of the body he
beliees to be the phenomenon that un
derlies the multiplication of these cells
in growth, and osmosis has been shown
by experiment to be closely connected
with electricity The writer referred
to beliees that we shall soon be able
to measure growth energy as we now
do heat or electricity and perhaps con
trol it so as to produce tall or short
families or races at our pleasure—

MAN KILLING HORSE
THE WAY HE ACQUIRE HIS HATRE
FOR HUMANKIN
*
It AH Begu With the CrdVl Treat
meat Ho Receied In His* Colthood
Vicious Incidents That Marked His
ownward Career
The deelopment of a icious horse
from an Innocent colt is described by
Powell Ford In one of the stories in
"Horses Nine" The colt's disposition
was first spoiled by Ignorant and cruel
handling on the farm of one Perkins
Then he was sold, and bis subsequent
career is thus picturedPersonal
In the weeks during which he trailed
oer the fruit district of southern Mich
igan in the wake of the horse buyer
Blue Blazes learned nothing good and
much that was ill He finished the trip
with raw hocks, a hoof print on his
flank nnd 'tooth marks, on neck and
withers  Horses led in a bunch do not
Improe in disposition
' Some of the scores the blue roan colt
paid In kind, some he did not, but he
learned the game of gie and take
Men and horses alike, he concluded,
were agalust him If he would hold
hla own, he must be ready with teeth
and hoofs Especially he carried with
him always a black, furious hatred of
man In general
So he went about with ears laid back,
the whites of his eyes showing and a
bite or a kick ready in any emergency
ay by day the bate in him deepened
until it became the master passion A
quick footfall behind him was enough
to send his heels flying as though they
hnd been released by a hair trigger He
kicked first and Inestigated afterward
The mere sight of a man within reach
ing distance roused all his ferocity
Toward his own kind Blue' Blazes
bore himself defiantly ouble harness
was something he loathed One was
not free to work his will on the de
spised drier if hampered by a pole
and mate ' In such cases he nipped
manes and kicked under the traces un
til released He had a special antip
athy for gray horses and fought them
on the smallest proocation or upon
none lit ail
As a result, Blue Blazes, while know
Ing no masters, had many owners,
sometimes three in a single week He
began his career by filling a three
months' engagement as a liery horse,
but after he had run away a dozen
times, wrecked seeral carriages and
disabled a hostler he was sold for half
liis purchase price 
Then did he enter upon his wander
ings in real earnest He pulled street
cnr* deliery wagons, drays and ash
otiris He was sold to unsuspecting
faraiore, who, when his eil traits
cropped out, swapped him unceremoni
ously and with Ingenious prearication
by the roadside In the natural course
of eents he was much punished
Up and across the southern penin
sula of Michigan he drifted conten
tiously, growing more icious with
each encounter, more daring after each
ictory In Mnskegon he sent the dri
er of a grocery wagon to the hospital
with a "shoulder bite requiring cauter
ization and four stitches In Manistee
he broke the small bones In the leg of
a baker's large boy In Cadillac a
boarding stable hostler struck him
with an iron shoel Blue Blazes kick
ed the hostler quite accurately and
ery suddenly through a window
Between Cadillac and Kalaska he
spent seeral liely weeks with farm
ers Most of them tried arious tam
ing processes Some escaped with
bruises and ' some suffered serious in
jury At Alpena he found an owner,
who, haing read something ery con
incing in a horse trainer's book, elab
orately strapped the roan's legs ac
cording to diagram and then went into
the stall to wreak engeance with a
riding whip Blue Blazes accepted one
cut, after which lie crushed the aeng
er against the plank partition until
three of the man's ribs were broken
The Alpena man was fished from un
der the roan's hoofs just in time to
sae his life
This incident earned Blue Blazes the
name of "man killer," and It stuck
He een figured in the newspaper dis
patches "Blue Blazes, the Michigan
Man Killer," "The Ugliest Horse
Alie," "Alpena's Equine Outlaw"—
these were some of the headlines The
Perkins method had borne fruit
The Barred Road
"There Is only one road to success in
life," said the man who had made his
lucky and retired
"And how shall I know the road?"
inquired the budding young man
"Well," replied the man with the
lucky, "you go right along this path
of adersity until you reach the first
turn to the right"
"Yes, yes"
"And you'll find a road barred oft
with a gate and a sign that says 'No
Trespassing' Well, that's it"—Balti

Extensie Kitchen Arrangements of
the Modern Hotel
The kitchen arrangements of the
modern hotel are on the first basement
floor There Is a chef, but so far as I
could see he does not cook He is sim
ply a captain of the seentyfie other
cooks, who work In three relays of
twentyfie each There is no range,
but a solid bank of broilers— immense
gridirons, beneath which are the fires
that neer die As for the 400 loaes
of bread and 8,000 rolls required dally,
the chef does not worry his mind' oer
the patent cutten and mixers  and
oens and staff of bakers needed to
supply the simple item of bread or con
cern himself with the quality of the
1,100 pounds of butter that are each
day required to go with it
I must not forget the item of eggs
Eighteen thousand are required eery
twentyfour hours Boiled eggs do not
get oerdone They are boiled by clock
work  A perforated dipper containing
the eggs drops down Into  the water
The dipper's clockwork is set to the
second, and when that final second has
expired the little dipper jumps up out
of the water, and the eggs are ready
for deliery There are men who do
nothing else but fill and watch and
empty these dancing dippers, and it
seemed to me great fun
On another part of this floor is the
dishwashing, where great galanized
baskets lower the pieces Into arious
solutions of potash and clean rinsing
water, all so burning hot that the
dishes dry instantly without 'wiping
Sixtyfie thousand pieces of china
ware are cleansed in a day and an al
most equal quantity of siler All
told, there are 300 employees In the
kitchen departments of this huge li
ing machine— Albert Bigelow Paine in

• SUCCESSFUL SMUGGLER
The Schemes He 'Worked to eceie
the Customs Officials
"There is money In smuggling," said
the retired dealer in precious stones as
he leaned back, "but it is dangerous to
carry on the business, as possible sus
pects are carefully watched and, if nec
essary, traced j till they are finally
caught Howeer, I knew one man
who pursued the trade of diamond
smuggling  for fifteen  years and was
able to retire to respectability He
was buyer for one of the large business
houses In New York, and his business
sent him to Europe two, three and
sometimes four times a year Eery
time he returned he had with him from
$10,000 to $20,000 worth of gems which
he did not declare /
"His trick was perfect simplicity
combined with ingenious boldness His
hair was scanty, and at the top of his
head he had a most delightful little
bald spot Customs officers as they
came and went all knew him, and aa
they ' knew him  he  had a most pro
nounced wen where his other acquaint
ances saw a bald spot That wen was
a work of art, made of wax and gum,
and it contained two or three big stones
that would hae been a find for the
men on the pier
"The good cigar that he bad just lit
and allowed to go out held a few more,
and sewed in the handle of the grip
that he carelessly turned oer to the
inspection of the officers were the rest
of them He neer aried the trick,
and he neer lost Each trip was worth
a couple of hundred dollars to him and
a great many hundred more to those
who employed him Now, that man
considered himself strictly honest He
would not steal a cent from an indi
idual, yet he schemed and plotted to
rob the goernment"— New York Press

SOFTCORE

The springs of red blood are
found in the soft core of the
bones called the marrow and

from the spleen Healthy bone
marrow and healthy spleen
are full of fat

KNOWING FIRE HORSES
Bow They Wan to Start With, the
Jl»»er and Get tne Swing
The intelligence of fire hones Is well
known A j most knowing animal of
thtg kind la described by Sewell Ford
In "Hones Nine" The author says of
himPersonal ;*•
Other things besides mischief, how
eer, had Siler learned Chief of these
was to start with the Jigger Bleeping
or waking, lying or standing, the sum
mons that stirred the men from snor
ing ease to tense, rapid action neer
failed to find Siler alert As the hal
ter shank slipped through the bit ring
that same Instant found Siler gath
ered for the ' rush through "tho long,
narrow 1 •••o leading from his open stall
to the 1 \h, aboe which, like great
couchaut spiders, waited the harnesses
pendent on the hanger rods, tj  
Once under the harness Siler was
like a cared statue until the trip strap
had been palled, the collar fastened
and the* reins snapped in Then be
wanted to poke the poles through the
doors, so eager was he to be off It
was no fault of Siler's that his team
could not make a two second hitch
With the first strain at the traces his
Impatience died out A sixty foot truck
starts with more or less reluctance, but
when once the tires caught the car
tracks Slier knew what to expect He
and his team mates could feel Lannl
gan gathering In the reins as though
for a full stop  Next came the whistle
of the whip It swept across their
flanks so quickly that It was practical
ly one stroke for them all Personal At the same
moment Lannlgan leaned far forward
and shot out bis driing arm The
reins went loose, their heads went for
ward and, as If moing on a piot,' the
three leaped as one hone  
Left to themseles, each bone would
hae leaped at a different instant It
was that one touch of the lash and the
succeeding swing of Lannlgan's bnlk
which gae them the measure, which
set the time, which made It possible for
less than 4,000 pounds of horseflesh to
jump a fle ton truck up the street at
a four minute clip

THE INUSTRIAL SITUATION
Not since the organization of
Amador county has the industrial
situation in this section been so be
set with difficulties as at present
There is perhaps nothing more para
lyzing to business interests than a
labor strike It is a declaration of
war between the forces of labor and
' capital — the employes and the em
ployers On the side of the former
is arrayed the weight of numbers;
on the side of the latter is arrayed
 the influence of wealth and property
If prolonged the struggle is as de
astating to industry and business
as the desolation caused by an in
ading army through a fertile and
smiling territory
The present calamity that has
suddenly oertaken the mining in
dustry of which Jackson is the center,
is appalling from any standpoint
In round numbers nearly 1000 men
hae been thrown out of employ
mentPersonal machinery and enterprises
costing in the neighborhood of three
million dollars hae been brought to
a dead standstill, except keeping tbe
shafts clear of water, a necessary
precaution against a total collapse
of these costly works All the ast
business enterprises dependent upon
the mining, industry are panic
stricken Property holders and
tradesmen are alarmed not merely
on account of the immediate stagna
tion of business, but more so on ac
count of what the future may bring
forthPersonal
Fortunately the strike so far has
been unattended by any acts of
physical iolence It is hoped this
will continue* to the end The " mine
owners hae made no effort to con
tinue work with nonunion labor
Neither side has einced a disposi
tion to yield the ital points in issue
Unquestionably the point that
brought about the almost total de
population of the underground wo^ks
was the issue of shorter hours " The
men were dissatisfied with the long
; working day of ten hours, and the
hops of relief in this respect made
the path of the union strikers much
easier than it would otherwise hae
been This question, howeer,
might no doubt hae been settled
satisfactorily without the extreme
measure of a strike The, mine
owners hae for some time had the
subject of shortening the working
hours under consideration If, as it
is claimed, a miner can do as much
work in eight hours as he has here
tofore done in ten, the owners would
hae nothing to lose by the change
 A trial of a ninehour day would un
questionably hae been conceded by
the companies If this resulted in
no diminuation in the amount of
work done, no increase of expense,
a trial of an eight hour system would
probably come next The recogni
tion of the union, and reinstatement
of discharged men are different prop
ositions The Ledger has always
conceded the right of workmen to
organize as labor unions for their
own protection It has been opposed
to coercion of other employes by the
union element It is opposed, to
dictation of employers by labor
organization It beliees that in
dustrial peace and prosperity can be
lastingly had only by employers re
taining the utmost freedom in the
transaction of their business The
situation in Jackson has undergone
a complete change within the past
few days And we are compelled to
look upon the situation as it exists,
not as we would wish to hae it
From a nonunion camp, it has been
transformed into a union town We
must accept the erdict as an ac
complished historical fact, howeer
discordant it may be to our con
ictions With the entire business
community, we join in' the hope that
the unfortunate condition of affairs
may be speedily terminated
A Rutland, Vt, jury, recently
awarded $2500 damages to a local
manufacturing company which
brought suit against one hundred
members of a labor organization, to
compensate it for losses and ex
penses growing out of a strike, and
the employment of detecties and
watchmen to protect its property
and nonunion employes The prop
erty of the defendants has been at

THE AMAOU , LEPGEHPersonal JACKSOKj CALIFOROTA, FRIAY, APRIL 17, 1903
A Strike ThirtyTwo Years Ago
I Tho present strike will undoubtedly
recall to tho mines of many of the old
timers of^Ainador county the trouble
that was precipitated £by tho Miners
Leaguoin this county in' 1871, and we
herewith publish a synopsis of what
occurred at that time
The Miners League organized as a
kind of mutual benefit association ; li
does not appear that any unlawful
measures were at first contemplated;
but organization gae the members an
idea of strength and influence Mer
chants joined the league, for fear of
losing the trade of the miners; politic
ians, , to make a few otes; and the law
loss and desperate, to work against law
and order in society In Suiter Crook;
it numbered about three hundred mem
bers, composed of Irish, Cornishmen,
Austrians and Italians, and had a
membership of perhaps as many more
in other,' parts, of the county They
built a large hall, cost seeral thousand
dollars Luke Burns, who had some
experience in similar associations in
Virginia City, was President, ,andL
J Marks, Secretary
The immediate cause of the outbreak
was the reduction of twentyfie cents
a day on the wages of tbe hands work
ing on the surface, in the Consolidated
Amador mine After much discussion
a general strike was agreed upon, also
a determination to enforce it eery
where, and> not permit the working
of the mines unless at the proposed
rates The schedule of wages demand
ed by  tbe Miners' League made ery
little adance oer the existing rates,
but the right to make ean a small ad
ance implied a right to control the
working of the mines, and the mine
owners refused to accept the rates
Members of the league to the number
of two hundred isited the different
mines, and ordered the stopping of the
work They carried no arms that
were in sight, though according to
some reports they suppliod themseles
with clubs from tbe woodpiles of the
mills It is now contended by some
that no threats or force was usedPersonal that
the miners went rather as a committee
of conference than as a menacing party
They would not permit any work to be
done, not een allowing an engine to
be run to keep the water out The
mills at Amador, Sutter and Oneida
were all stopped It is true that some
of the mines, like the Keystone, Con
solidated, Amador, and others, were
paying, mines, and could hae paid
higher wages and diidends also; but
other mines like the Oneida had neer
paid diidends, but had always boon
worked at a loss The wages paid ar
ied from two dollars and a half a day
for top hands, to four dollars for un
derground men There was no plea
that the wages were insufficient to sup
port the families, or less than were
paid in other laborious occupations,
but it was intended to raise them to
the Virginia and Gold Hill standard,
where the expenses of liing wore much
higher The daily threats of destruc
tion of life and property showed the
existence of so much illfeeling that the
Goernor was inoked for aid, and a
body of olunteers, under General
Cnzenau, came from San Francisco
and camped on tbe hill near the old
Wolerine shaft Thoy had' seoral
pieces of artillery, and formed  reg
ular military camp, sending out and
relieing guards eery eening for the
different mines' The throats of life
and property extended to other parts
of i the county It seemed that the
officers of justice were paralyzed Tbe
newspapers of the county said little
about it, as if fearful that a word
might bring destruction upon thorn
Tho isult was a general 'prostration
of business The towns around the
quartz mines had been tho principal
markot for produce for some years,
and when a thousand or more men
were thrown out of employment and
the money which was usually paid as
wages ceased to circulate, the depress
ion in business was uniersal, produc
ing in some instances actual distress
The soldiers remained in the county
for seeral weeks, and preented any
destruction of property Some kind of
concession was made which terminated
the siege, and the soldiers ''left, al
though the illfeelingr engendered by
the operation remained for some time
The damage to the county by this
affair can hardly be estimated The
mines of gold and copper, as well as
other minerals, require the aid of capi
tal to be made profitable Capital must
be protected, or it silently sbuts itself
up In subsequent years, tbe memory
of the Amador war dierted many
thousands from inestment in the
county

A Smashed  Wheel
A collision occurred last Friday after
noon on the Kennedy road just out of
town, between one of Piccardo's
freight teams and a buggy [ belonging
to Wilford ennis The buggy was
occupied by Mrs Botto of Sutter
Creek, Charlie Parker and little Jack
ennis, who were on their way to Mrs
Botto's homo when the^ buggy met the
team in front of r Schacht's house
It turned out to the right, but not far
enough to allow the freight team to
pass in safety, as both wheels of one of
the wagons struck the buggy, and
smashed one of the wheels to pieces,
but fortunately none of the occupants
were injured They were obliged to
postpone their trip on account, of the
disabled wheel There seems to be a
difference of opinion between j ennis
and Piccardo wherein the fault lies
The former claiming that the buggy
had turned out as far as it could, and
that the drier of the team made no
attempt to swing his team to the op
posite side of the road ennis will
undoubtedly make a claim for damages, 
and we trust the matter will be settled
satisfactorily to both parties
Accidentally Shot
 The eleen year old son of Emanuel
Garibaldi was accidentally shot by his
cousin last Saturday 'forenoon i near
their home on the south' fork, about
four miles from Jackson From r
Eodicott, who was called to wait upon
the wounded boy, we learn that the
two Garibaldi boys, cousins, with an
other boy, were hunting for some stray
cows at the time of the accident  The
eldest cousin was carrying a gun on his
shoulder which was full cocked, and
while in the act of raising the gun to
shoot a hawk which was flying oer
bead it was accidentally discharged,
and the charge struck the eleen year
old boy in the leg just below tho groin,
inflicting a ery dangerous wound
and causing a great loss of blood before
r Endicott appeared on the scene
nearly an hour later, he being sum
moned as soon as ; the parents of the
boy were notified The boy was de
lirous and ery weak for seeral days,
but is now improing, and the doctor
has strong hopes of his recoery
A Narrow Escape
Monday morning Wm Finn, the
machinist in Garbarlni Bro's, shop,
had a narrow escape from serious in
jury, which was aoided only by the
coolheadedness of himself and Joe Gar
barlni The two men were replacing a
belt that had come off a pulley on the
line shaft Finn was standing on a
ladder, and while the pulley was In
motion he was using his hands to re
place the belt One of his sleees
caught in the belt, and his arm was
immediately drawn around the pulley
by the rapidly moing belt, and his
body was drawn up against the frame
work that held the shaft in position
Realizing his perilous position he called
to Garbarlni, whose back was turned
at the time  Joe took in the situation
at once, and with what assistance Finn
could gie him they pulled back on the
belt with sufficient force to throw off
the driing belt on the engine, which
of course stopped the machinery
Finn was fortunate to escape with a
good scare and a tew bruises," for which
he is ery thankful, as it might hae
been much worse
Tribute of a Friend
j Arthur Greenwood was born in Ama
dor City September 14, 1886 The
greater portion of his young life was
spent In Jackson, where he was known
to all as a good, industrious boy,
studious at school, and always cheerful
and willing to help make his home a
pleasant one For the past three years
he has lied at Middle Bar with his
parents, and attended the public school
at that place The duties of his father
and older brothers hae called them
from home much of the time since the
family has lied at the rier, and upon
Arthur fell the duties of the house and
his mother's protector, which responsi
bilities were cheerfully taken up by
the deoted son
It was his ambition to secure a good
education, and prior to his death he was
studying to take the ninth grade di
ploma examination, and after com
pleting the public school course he in
tended to work and sae the money to
attend college His parents and teacher
had hopes of a brilliant future for him
His death has been a sad blow to his
family as well as the entire community
in which he lied, as he was uniersally
loed, and always had a pleasant smile
for his acquaintances and playmates
His death was caused by heart failure,
prooked by impoerishment of the
blood, thus cutting down a young and
noble life He was buried in Jackson
by the side of his twin sister Alice, who
died two years ago r''

A STRIKE ECLARE
All Mines of Jackson istrict Under
the Ban of W F M
The muchtalked of strike came to a
head on Monday morning All kinds
of opinions had been indulged in for
seeral days before the eentful time
came, as to what would come to pass
It was well known that the strength of
the miners' union in actual members
employed at the seeral mines in this
neighborhood was not great But the
question of what effect a strike declared
by the union would hae upon those
not identified with the local organiza
tion was an entirely different question
This was the ital point Would the
nonunion rcon continue work in face
of the strike  If they surrendered with
tho rest the matter would assume a
ery serious phase for the mother lode
mines Sunday night ilie union held
its usual weekly meeting That was
supposed to bo the time when the  re
port of the committee appointed to
sere the demands upon the superin
tendents would be made
 Early Monday morning notices were
posted around town, and in the icinity
of the mines concerned, to the follow
ing effectPersonal j »Personal;
Strike Notice — Notice Is hereby gien
to all men of Jackson district that a
strike is declared on all mines and mills
of Onoida, Zeila, Gwin, Kennedy, ; Cen
tral Eureka and South Eureka mines
M W Moor, of W F M
W  Ould, Pres
At the change of shift at tho mines
named, delegations of union men went
to the mines, not in large bodies, but
in squads of two or three, and inter
cepted the men as they were going to
and from employment They were
stationed too at all trails and roads lead
ing to the works Web Smith, super
intendent of tho Kennedy, and J H
Hampton, superintendent of thoOuoitia,
objected to the inasiou of tho grounds
by the strikers— or rather thp union
forces who were determined to inaugu
rate a strike Most of the employes
were persuaded to turn back Some
were interiewed at the Kennedy
works The superintendent told the
men that they would be protected
while on the premises or at work This
was not broad enough for the men
They were informed that if they work
ed they would bo blacklisted by the
union No actual iolence was in
dulgod in The leaders were shrewd
enough to tell the men to aoid demon
strations of iolence, to refrain from
carrying weapons; promises of good
behaior were made to the, officers
Neertheless the impression was con
eyed that the path of safety lay in
quitting work _ Practically all the
underground tollers of the Kennedy,
Central Eureka, and South Eureka
quit work Many did so simply because
they saw the others turning back
At the Oneida superintendent Hamp
ton would not allow interference inside
inclosure The boarding and sleeping
houses of tho company would accom
modate fifty men at least; they ~ were
guaranteed protection; twentyfour
men out of considerably oer 100 re
fused to go out, and went to work
At the Zeila the pickets were posted
on the road and eery aenue of ap
proach But notwithstanding eery
man reported for work at the morning
shift, except one W F otert, the
superintendent, was exceedingly grati
fied at this result The men were sat
isfied with their work and pay, and
showed it by refusing to listen to the
solicitations of the strikers,
All through the day the ranks of
the union forces were swelled by new
members Common rumor says that
40 new men joined Sunday night; Mon
day oer 100 are said to hae joined
The initiation fee of $3, it was said,
would be raised to $10 in a'day or two
Whother the men were promised sup
port from the funds of the federation
we do not Rumors are current on both
sides of this question Seeing
the success of the moe to get the men
out, it is not surprising that there was
a strong accession to the union side •
In the afternoon, as the change of
shift at the Zeila approached, the
union men gathered in their hall on
Court street, and from there marched
through Main street, in double file
oer 100 strong, to the Zeila works,
the object being to show sufficient
strength to induce the men not to go
to work The strikers kept in the road
and sidewalk They did not go beyond
tho large gate on the north of the
works Eery man going to or com
ing from the mine was surrounded and
made the fussilade of persuasion Most
of tho marchers were Austrians, many
of them strangers in Jackson Natural
ly the employes were oerawed by | the
show of numbers A few went on to
the mine, but not enough to justify
work, W F etert was in his office
He expected a demonstration of this
character, He watched the proceed
ings not only from inside the inclosure,
but also walked through the mass of
strikers lining the sidewalk Under
ground work is suspended Tho mine,
as with all the rest, is being kept free
from water, but how long this will con
tinue is uncertain' There  was ore
enough out to run tho mill until Sat
urday, when it shut down also
Tuesday the force at the Oneida was
reduced about onehalf On that day,
rumors were afloat that the strikers
intended to make a demonstration at
the Gwin mine Early in the after
noon they marched (from their hall,
the procession headed by the American
flag By actual count 16C filod out
These were joined by others at differ
ent points, and no doubt the force all
told was fully 200 strong They set
out to tramp the whole distance, fully
six miles, oer a rough road  They
had not boon gone more than half an
hour, when word reached here that
the management of the Gwin had an
ticipated the moe by discharging all
the men, except enough to keep the
works in order This completed the
tieup of the mines hereabouts
Nearly 1000 men are idle Property
that cost fully two million dollars to
bring it to its present position is at a
standstill How long this state of af
fairs will continue is the perplexing
question It la being asked by busi
neas men "and property holders gen
erally The outlook is really alarming
On the one band it is claimed, that
Jackson hereafter is bound to be a
union town, and that it is better to
bow' to the eneitable, and look around
to see if there be not 'some common i
ground upon which the two interests
may meet and settle the difference
The matter of hours is the great
stumbling block _ with the miners
Scores of men went out on this score,
who would not hae quit if this issue
had not been raised
On the other hand, the matter of
submitting to the demands of any or
ganization on this question is a serious
matter to the mine owners Altogether
the situation is dubious Business of
all kinds is practically at a standstill,
In sympathy with the mines Unless
promptly settled the situation will be
come more critical as time goes by
The presence of 500 or 600 idle men is
a source of danger in itself It must
be said that those at the' head of the
strike moement, are, ' by  adice and
example, doing all they can to preent
breaches of tho peace It is hoped
tLat they will bo able to keep their
forces in control to the end
WENESAY
lathis crisis eents hae followed
each; other with startling rapidity
Wednesday morning brought deelop
ments of ominous import First came
the report that the South Eureka had
decided to quit, allowing the mine to fill
with water 'This property has strug
gled ; along for fourteen  years Its
shaft has been drien down twenty
three hundred feet, with exploration
drifts and crosscuts in oory direction,
in the hope of deeloping a paying
mine ' The prospecting In progress
when the strike was declared reealed
an orebody of a better grade * Stock
holders were encouraged Now, their
hope has boon turned to despair To
face labor troubles in the teeth of long
years of unremunoratie outlay, was
more than the company felt justified in
enduring So a complete shutdown
has been ordered As the works of the
South Eureka are connected with those
of the Central Eureka, it is doubtful
whether the two mines can be drained
through the one shaft of the latter
mine J A burden Is thereby thrown
upon the Central Eureka— a diidend
paying mine— which it is entirely un
prepared to assume, adding materially
to the difficulty of the situation
Next came the report that N P
Williams and other carpenters on their
way to work at the east shaft of the
Kennedy had been met by a body of
strikers and turned back Also, that
Eb Brown, engineer at the Kennedy
old shaft, bad been stopped on his way
home from shift, and intimidated, re
sulting in stopping the hoisting of
water, and preparations for closing the
shaft This news, although not sur
prising to many, struck the community
as a thunder clap  It meant the begin
ning of the end It appears that a
mob of strikers, about sixty in num
ber, stopped Williams and others M
W Moor was spokesman  In the case
of JJrown,he met ten or twele' union
men strung out along the Kennedy
grade  He was, on horseback, as his
home is near Scottsillo, and he rides
to and from bis work He was asked
to join the union, and refused Then
he was told not to go to work; that
that would sere them as well as bo
coming a member Finally he was in
formed that It would be better for htm
not to return to his work Coming in
this way he naturally interpreted the
language in the nature of threats He
rode back to the Kennedy office and
reported what had occurred Told the
superintendent that he would rather
throw up his job than hae to run the
risk of iolence in the distance of se
eral miles that he had to traerse in
riding, to and fro Mr Smith, the
superintendent, said he could not
blamti him for feeling that way; that It
was not necessary to report for work
in the eening as he had receied word
from the officers to plank down the
shaft He was honorably discharged
Men were sent down the mine to gather
up the tools to that end
At the Oneida mine the managers
resoled to make a determined effort
to continue work A substantial fence
inclosed both mine and mill, also
boarding and sleeping houses Super
intendent Hampton told the employes
he would keep them on the grounds
and protect them while there Under
this arrangement he secured some
twentyfie men He had a man
posted to keep out  intruders Wed
nesday afternoon he came to town to
warn the strike leaders to keep off the
grounds; that if any effort was made
to interfere with the men inside there
would be trouble Neertheless a large
body of strikers moed in that direc
tion toward eening They separated
into smaller squads, and took in points
at the Kennedy on the way Superin
tendent Hampton was aware of the
moe Sheriff Norman and eputy
Jackson also repaired to the scene, and
oertook detached bodies on their way
A few words were exchanged The
strikers returned to town without at
tempting to assemble in force with
sight of the Oneida Thursday morn
ing the working force was increased to
thirty men ;
The two men, W J Nettle and Geo
Troyan, who hae been running a pros
pect tunnel into the Hoffman ground
for many months, were ordered to quit
Wednesday eening This work has
been done by W F etert indiidually
at a cost of between $200 and $300 per
month It was not included in the
strike notice The incident seres to
illustrate how readily moements of
this kind, een from the standpoint of
its supporters, drift to extremes
The Zeila is one of the mainstays of
Jackson It is now on the ragged edge
as it were Mr etert, the superiten
dent, who has contributed more toward
the upbuilding of the town and county
than any other man liing, and whose
efforts in this direction hae been poor
ly appreciated by an ungenerous pub
lic, is now, in this storm of misrepresen
tion and aderse criticism, actually
keeping the mine from being flooded
and ruined on his own responsibility
The controling stockholders are in fa
or of abandonment, while he is sta
ing off this disaster for a few days in
THE OL REUABLE
ROYAL BAKING POWER
Absolutely Pure
THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE
the hope that the sober second thought
of tho community will offer some solu
tion'of the difficulty consistent with his
selfrespect and conictions of duty
Thursday the mine managers held
a meeting in Sutter Creek to discuss the
situation The representaties were
firm and unyielding on the principles
at stake, but at the same time einced
a spirit of fairness in treating with
employes The following manifesto ex
pressie of their position was adoptedPersonal'
Art _ m *
The Miners' Union at Jackson on
April 13, 1903, declared a strike against
the following minesPersonal Gwin, Zeila, Ken
nedy, Oneida, South Eureka and Cen
tral Eureka 
We are informed by our employes
that at that time the Union had a ery
small membership, and that few if any
of our men belonged to the same, yet
by threats and  intimidation the Union
has caused a ' great many of our em
ployes to quit work and hae een
drien off sqme of the engineers with
the expressod intention of flooding the
mines and thus causing almost irrepar
able damages
I The men themseles who work in our
mines hae no grieance that we know
of; they hae neer asked for conces
sions that hae not been granted; we
are now and always hae been willing
to treat with our own employes fairly
and impartially and gie them the best
pay and shortest hours our properties
can afford
 The ore in the mines in this district
is low grade and many of our compan
ies are regularly leying assessments
contributed in large part by our resi
dent citizens •
Unless our employes are afforded
protection by the authorities we cannot
operate our properties, and they will
hae to remain closed indefinitely
We therefore ask that law and order
be enforced by our law officials, that
intimidation and threats cease and that
eery man who wants to work be per
mitted to do so

Twentyfirst Anniersary
Friday night, April 10, Golden Star
Chapter No 66, O E S, celebrated
their twentyfirst anniersary at their
hall These annual gatherings are
always looked forward to by the mem
bers of the chapter and their friends, as
their reputation for a royal good time
is established so well that a mere an
nouncement of the occasion is sure to
bring out more people than the
Masonic hall can accommodate This
anniersary, howeer, was more than
those of former years Not only had
the chapter attained its lawful twenty
one years of age and could look back
upou a childhood of peace, harmony
and prosperity, but something else was
"doing" It was known that two
worthy members, tried and true, were
one the ee of taking their departure
from Jackson, and to bid a fond fare
well to Mr and Mrs S G Spagnoli
was the last but not least eent of the
occasion While the gathering ] was
one of joy and good will, yet there was
sorrow in the hearts of all, particularly
the members of Golden Star Chapter
who had known the departing friends
so long, and itwas like seering family
ties to bid them goodbye Mr and
Mrs Spagnoli are charter members of
Golden Star Chapter, and hae gien
their time and support to the ' order
that they loed through all these years,
and it seemed a strange coincidence
that they should take their departure
on the twentyfirst anniersary of the
chapter's birth It is needless to men
tion any praise of the brother and
sister at this time Enough was dem
onstrated by those present to conince
all of the thoughts on eery one's mind,
and "God be with you" was read on
the faces of all A short and Interest
Ing program was presented In an
interesting manner Introductory
remarks were made by the worthy
matron, Mrs Nellie Kent, followed by
an address, "The gVand feature of the
order," U G Spagnoli Mrs E H
Harrington, Mrs E Zumbiol, Mrs
Morrow  B Spagnoli, Miss Matson,
Miss Nettie Morrow, and little Emerson
Harrington enliened the time with
music, songs and readings, after which
the Mandolin Club, whose members are
r Carl Schacht, Wm Penry, Frank
Valo and H Allan, rendered sweet
music throughout the eening  Fare
well speeches wore made by Judge Rust,
R C Bole, J W Caldwell, r Wil
son and Re F A Morrow, which
were feelingly replied to by the de
parting brother in behalf of himself
and wife At eleen o'clock the ban
quet tables were spread, and of all the
good things to eat, words couldn't
begin to tell Suffice to say, Golden
Star Chapter always does this part of
the program to a nicety, and this oc
casion was no exception to the rule
It was after midnight before final leae
taking was said, and had our friends
known the effort it cost to say good
bye, it is doubtful if they would hae
attempted it, and they well know the
esteem in which they are held by the
Masonic fraternity as well as all the
people of Jackson

MINING NOTES
ArgonautKennedy— A dispatch
was receied in Jackson Monday that
the supreme court of the United States
had denied the petition of the Kennedy
Company for a rehearing in the cele
brated suit between these two com
panies which has  been dragging
through the courts for the past eight
years This settles the matter finally
There is no other recourse left for re
opening the case Nothing interenes
to the starting up of work on the
Argonaut property except the labor
troubles The uncertainty of the situ
ation cannot fall to delay matters, as
contractors for supplies are timid about
getting out timbers and other needed
material The "strike clause" leaes
the company at liberty to decline the
supplies contracted for in the eent of
a strike So the timber and lagging
business is crippled by the suspense

A STRANGE LEGEN
Origtn of a Carious Custom Obsered
by Bulgarian Masons
Nine master masons who were en
gaged in building a citadel in the time
of the Voi oid Neagoe found on re
turning to their work each morning
that the portion of the wall which they
had completed tbe day before had fall
en to pieces during the night and was
lying In a heap of ruins in the ditch
Manol of Curtea, the head mason, in
formed his comrades one morning that
a oice from heaen had warned him
in his sleep the night before that their
labors would continue to come to
naught unless they all swore on that
ery morning to Immure in the struc
ture the first woman, be it wife, moth
er, daughter or sister, who should ar
rie with the morning meal of one
or either of them They all took the
oath, and the last man had hardly been
sworn when Hanoi's own wife appear
ed, carrying her husband's breakfast
The oath was kept and tbe woman,
known in the legend as "Flora of tbe
Fields,'' was murdered and her blood
and flesh incorporated with the wall of
masonry
A curious practice of the Bulgarian
masons, (the aboe scene is laid In l*rrt»
garla), which suries to this day, tes
tifies to the itality of the legend To
insure the solidity of the houses the;
build they measure with a reed the
shadow of the first person who passes
after tbe digging of the foundation
has been completed When the foun
dation is commenced, this reed is buried
under the first rock, usually the corner
stone
Where Barley Is Cultiated
Barley extends oer a wider climatic
range than any of the other grains and
Is successfully cultiated oer a great
er breadth of the globe than any other
cereal It flourishes under the heat
and drought of the borders of the torrid
zone and grows sturdily and maturely
on the northern erge Of the temperate
zone, ripening and thriing under ari
ous aderse circumstances which wheat
is wholly unable to resist Barley Is
found in the Faroe Islands, near Cape
North, the extreme point of Norway;
near Archangel, on the White sea, and
in central Siberia between 68 and 59
degrees north latitude In genial cli
mates, such as those of Egypt Barbary
and the south of Spain, two crops of
barley may be reaped In the same year,
one in spring from seed sowed the pre
ious autumn and one in autumn from
a spring sowing
A Lost Combination
The Chinese had all the grand secrets
of electrical discoeries more than 3,000
years ago, and they made use of the
magnet as loadstone long before that
Historical records show where their ar
mies were led across the ast plains of
the interior of the nation by a combi
nation of electricity as a combined
power of loadstones and some other
substances unknown to the Celestials
of the present day
This form of electricity is among the
lost arts and must come to the front
with other grand discoeries within the
next few years But not the great and
learned shall hae the benefit of this
forthcoming discoery in electricity
The one who shall hae this golden
key to a grand electric mystery shall
hae the fruits of his labors
Contagions isease* Among Plant*
AU the fungous diseases of plants,
such as mildew, scab, blight, rust, rot!
etc, are contagious The contagion is
carried from year to year in the dis
eased part, be it leaf, fruit or branch
The presence of any of this diseased
material in the orchard or ineyard in
creases the chance of the appearance
and spread of the disease another year
Nothing is so destrucUe to the fungus
spores as fire, and all affected plants
or parts of plants should be cut out and
burned

HOIiING A CIGAR
Points In  Han's Character the Act
Said to isclose
id you eer notice the different
ways men hold cigars or cigarettes?
id 3'ou eer obsere how you yourself
hold one?
There are about a dozen different
ways, and probably no two men hold
theft cigars exactly alike
A judge of human nature may pick
up iuterusUng points as to character
from Wathing smokers
One man will hold his cigar firmly
between thumb and forefinger He la
usually a resolute, tenacious man,
strenuous or merely phlegmatic, as the
case may bo, but neer hy His fin
gers are stumpy sPersonal*\" J '
Another man holds the cigar loosely
between his first and second fingers
He is apt to be graceful, lazy, Irreso
lute, " a man of artistic temperament,
but not a hustler His fingers are long
and tapering
A third man will carry his cigar with
the lighted end turned In toward the
palm, the hand held scoop shape around
it He picked up that trick when
smoking on the sly as a boy, fearing
papa might break suddenly Into the
gnme He is usually of a secretie na
ture and not marked by any special
tendency to frankness
 A fourth  will hold his cigar awk
wardly, nerously gripping it and often
staring at it inquisitiely to see how it
is burning lie is not a "natural smok
er," nor is he apt to be what is known
as a "good fellow" He is usually anx
ious to conciliate others and has not
great force of character
Watch the man behind the cigar and
see if all these character drawings are
not correct— New York World
A CHEAP SQUARE MEAL
Successful Scheme That Waa Worked
by Two Hung~ry Hen
"One of the cleerest 'grafts' I eer
saw was worked the other day in a
quick lunch restaurant on Park row,"
said the Obserer "I noticed two men
talking earnestly just below the place
as I was going in to get my lunch One
of them followed me in and took a seat
just below me at the table A few sec
onds later the other entered and took a
seat just opposite his friend,' whom he
did not appear to know Tbe first man
ordered a ery extensie dinner, com
mencing with soup and ending with
charlotte russe and coffee He got tbe
ery best that the place could afford,
and his check for $135 was placed in
front of him The other man took his
time about ordering, taking corned
beef and beans— lo cents' worth His
check was placed in the center of the
table, between the two men
"Number one ate hastily and finished
first x He got up, put on bis bat and
then calmly picked up the ten cent
check that belonged to his friend
Without turning a hair he went to the
desk, paid 10 cents and walked out A
few minutes later number two, who
had been reading the paper, prepared
to leae and took up the remaining
check He appeared greatly surprised
nnd called the waiter, asking for an
explanation There was nothing for the
knight of the napkin to do but gie the
man a new ten cent check, as it was
ery eident that he bad not eaten
$135 worth of food I suppose that the
two met outside and at the nest place

We Meet the President Easily
One striking characteristic of Wash
ington life is the ease with which an
interiew can be* held with the presi
dent, the members of the cabinet and
the holders of office How they get
through their current work with all
these interruptions is a mystery, but
they do It is undoubtedly better that
a subject should be discussed de io
olx with the chief than that it should
filter through many channels, to arrie
as a more or less garbled ersion at
headquarters The result bears good
fruit for things are often settled off

go uring? the Process
I English explorers und scientists hae
brought back a series of remarkable
iliclinciis of Maori tattooing from the
interior of New Zealand The most aa
tonlsliiug designs were found on* the
fnces of the women
The faces and bodies of the women
arc so coered with these blue marks
that they look as If they had on a tight
fitting chintz dress
, The instrument employed in tattooing
to obtain the deep furrows is usually
mude of bone, haing a sharp edge Hke
a chisel and shaped in the fashion of a
garden hoe Another style Is made of a
shark's tooth
The tattooing of the women Is com
menced when about the age of fifteen
or eighteen and continues until they
reach middle age Most of the masters
of the art are professionals, who go
from illage to illage and are highly
paid for their serices The pattern
about to be engraed is first outlined
on tbe face with a small stick dipped in
powdered charcoal, after which the
skin is gashed, and the coloring or pig
ment is Introduced into the cut flesh
with a stick dipped into the liquid
; The coloring material used is gener
ally the resin of a certain tree, which
is burned, powdered and conerted into
a fluid '
The First Measure of Time
It was the moon and not the sun
which first suggested to mankind the
circle of the year as a measure of
time The sun exhibits no changes of
appearance, and his light obliterates
all tbe landmarks of the sky A lu
minary which is the same yesterday,
today and tomorrow might gie rise to
conceptions of perfection and eternity,
but beyond the alterations of day and
night it could suggest to men's minds
no abstract measure of time But with
our bumble satellite it is far otherwise
The regularly recurring phenomena of
new moon and full moon are  too
marked to escape the attention of the
most obtuse and unreflecting of sa
ages
The motion of the sun may be com
pared to that of the minute band of a
clock, sweeping on hour after hour with
out leaing much record of Its compar
atiely ast Journey The progress of
the moon, on the contrary, may be lik
ened to that of tbe hour hand, which
registers the moements of its com
panion and resoles them Into twele
well defined periods
Two Views of the Same Question
i A noted bishop In order to point a
lesson in humility sometimes tells a
story of a young clergyman whose first
appointment was to be an out of tbe
way and poor parish
On his first Sunday In this new sta
tion the young man as be looked oer
his wretchedly clad and Ignorant con
gregation could not help saying to him
self, with a groanPersonal
"ear me, what a dreadful thing it
would be if I should hae to stay here
any great length of time!"
| At the end of tbe sermon a deacon
made a prayer To the young man's
horror one part of the prayer was a
beneolent hope that "this ignorant in
experienced, barren pastor that ' bad
lately come to the parish might Im
proe and grow learned and fruitful in
good works, so that be would come to
merit being kept on there for awhile"
The Pillow of the Italian Peasant
The Italian peasant girl as soon as
she has learned to spin and sew begins
to make her wedding trousseau Thence
piece by piece it grows, and she has
put into it all her finest stltchery and
sweetest thoughts As soon as she is a
bride she makes a bag of fine muslin
This she begins to fill with rose leaes
Bach year adds its share When she
dies, perhaps an old woman full of
years, It is this rose pillow that her
bead rests on In this calm acceptance
of and preparation for the great eents
of life, such as marriage, and death,
there are time and soil for the blos
soming of fancy which we, stumbling,
hit and miss, through life, do not fur
nish
Why nmas Laughed
Sir Richard Wallace once heard the
elder umas laughing boisterously In
his study and was told by a serant
that umas was working and that be
often laughed like that at his work It
turned out that the great noelist was
"in company with one of his own char
acters, at whose sanies be was simply
roaring" But this was yean ago, when
Imagination went band In hand with
animal spirits It would be difficult to
Imagine one of the modern Intense,
realistic, analytical school so easily di
erted
