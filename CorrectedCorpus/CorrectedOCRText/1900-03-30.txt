,„* Articles of incorporation -for a. bank,'
,'V;tSbe'known'a3 the Calaveras County

2 Camp, ,"were .filed" with the County
-/Clerk' last 'Saturday. The capital

and -H. Brunner of San Francisco.
: The bank will be opened for business
in a short time and will doubtless
prove a great benefit to the business
men, not only of Angels, but of the
. whole county. •
If more care is not taken in the
handling of firearuis, some one is liable
to be injured yet in this town.- At all
hours of the day the report of guns
and pistols can be heard, and not in
frequently the rattle of shot or whistle
of a bullet, shows tb"at the shooter was
not particular as to , his < range. One
day last week as Mrs. W indwell, accom
' panied by her. daughter, was out near
the- Protestant cemetery gathering
. flowers, a bullet, evidently from a' rifle
of large caliber, passed through her
■ hat, cutting a " feather from the trim
ming. This was- a close call, and
should be a sharp warning to those
. r who are prone to reckless shooting.

£ Paloma has a sensation in the dis
appearance of Victor Peterson, a well-.
■ known business man of that place."
The whole affair is shrouded in mys
tery, which the to'al otticors havo'bepn
unable to solve. Peterson was en
gaged in "general merchandising and
was doing a profitable business. On
Thursday evening a week ago,
March 15th, he left his home to go to
the barber shop ol Louis Blais to- be
shaved, leaving his Morn open. ; , He
did -go to the barber shop 'and 'was
shaved. When ho left Blats' place no
one saw whither he vr«nt. but there all
traces of him w«»re lost. ,He has not
since been seen nor heard f»tt.m. j PeteV
■Wn was married about six' months
ago to a divorced woman, formerly a
Miss Herbet. So far as known his
home life was happy.- His affairs have
been found . in a prosperous condition
and thoroughly straight. It is thought
that he had between $300 and $400 on
his person when he disappeared. He
had this money in Gwin mine checks,
which he had converted inio cash tbe
afternoon- of the day on which he dis
appeared.
There seems to be a feeling in the
community that Peterson has gone to
seek-new pastures, though there is a
possibility of ■ foul play. A careful
search of old shafts and tunnels has
been' made, but without any results.
Considering that Peterson left his
stock of goods, his gold watch and
personal jewelry, his best clothing,
and; indeed, all his worldly possessions,
the sum of money he carried away
looks insignificant. ' .
The Sheriff's office has' been ap
pealed to and is taking a hand in the
search. The following description of
Peterson has been sent out: He is a
Scandinavian, between - 35 and 40 years
of age, rather heavily built, 5 feet 9
inches tall, wears light moustache and
is of light complexion. . A peculiajfea-^
ture 'of ' the case isj that .though her
husband disappeared on ' Thursday
evening, Mrs. Peterson made no in
quiry concerning him until Saturday
morning following.

. Nicaragua boasts of a volcano called
Misaya, about which a curious but
hardly credible story is told. When,
in ' 1522, the Spaniards overran the
state, the volcano- was very lively.
Many of the victorious Spaniards'
thought that the raging fire at the'
foot of the crater was neither more nor
less than the purest gold in; a molten.
state. The puzzle was how to get it. ,
But at last a- few men, more foolish and
more venturesome than their mates,'
had .themselves lowered down until, by
means of an iron chain with a bucket'
at the end of it, they "could reach the
fiery mass. Of course, as soon as the
bucket neared the surface it was melted
in a moment, and- the silly fellows,
when drawn up, were half-dead from
the heat and the poisonous ! smoke.—

How They Died, Their Last Words and
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson
both died on tho pave day. and that
the 4th of July, 1826. They were
friends during: their latter years, and
Adams' last Voids were: "Thomas
Jefferson still lives, " but history shows
that he was mistaken. Jefferson had
died an hour before,- exclaiming:
"Lord, now lettest thou that thy ser
vant depart in peace, '"and "I resign my
soul to God— and my daughter to my
country." John Quincy Adams ga re
his last breath in the Capitol at Wash
ington, saying: "This is the cod of
earth, I am content," and General
Harrison, who dieo in the White
House said: "Sir, I wish you to under
stand the principles of government. I
wish them carried out. I ask nothing
more."
Garfield's last reported, words, as he
lay racked by his terrible wound,
were:_ "Oh, that pain!" But Lincoln
became unconscious when he was shot,
and remained so till he died.' George
Washington was sane during his last
hours, and he spent them in calmly ar
ranging his affairs. - He told his wife
to bring two wills which Le had made,
and to burn one of them. He then
grasped his pulse with one hand and
counted the beats until he dropped
back dead. Washington died of
quinsy, Polk of malaria, Andrew John
son of paralysis and General Harrison
of pleurisy owing to his exposure dur
ing the inaugural ceremonies.
President Jackson, was for thirty
one years a diseased man, and the lat
ter part of his life was spent in almost
continuous pain. Even on his . death
he was besieged by office seekers.. "I
am dying," said he "as fast as I can,
and they, all know it; but they keep
swarming about me in crowds, seeking
for office — intriguing for office." His
death-bed scene was a most affecting
one. A half an hour before his death
his children and friends were standing
around his bedside, and his adopted
son Andrew had taken his hand and
whispered in bis ear:
"Father, how do you feel? Do you
know me?" • .
"Know you? Yes, I should know
you all if I could see. Bring me my
spectacles."
These were brought and put on him,
and he said: "Where is my daughter
and Marian? God will take care, of you
for me. lam my God's. I belong to
him. I go but a short time before
you, and I want to meet you all, white
and black, in heaven.". :
At this all burst into teal's, and the
General said: "What is the matter
with you, my dear children? Have I
alarmed your ""Oh, ■ don't ~ cry. Be
good children, and we will all meet in
heaven:"
These were Jackson's last' words. A
short time after this he passed peace
fully away. He died a Christian and a
Presbyterian.
Thomas Jefferson was more of a de
ist than anything else, and when ho
died he said he would be glad to see a
preacher who called "as. a good neigh
bor," thereby intimating that ho did
not care to see him professionally.
There was no preacher present at
Washington's death-bed. He was an
Episcopalian, and for many years a
vestryman of Christ Church, Alexan
dria, Va. The two Adams' believed in
Unitarian doctrines, and it is said that
John Quincy Adams, during his last
years, never went to sleep without re
peating that little child's prayer: •
■ "Now I lay me down to sleep, :
I pray Thee, Lord, my soul to keep; .
. If I should die before I wake,
I pray Thee, Lord, my soul to take.*' '
There is considerable doubt as to
Lincoln's Christianity, but his best
friends believe him to be a believer.
He was certainly a great Bible-reader,
and understood it thoroughly. Frank
Pierce was an Episcopalian and a
church member. Generals Grant and
Hayes attended the Methodist Church
while in' the White House, and Gar
field spent his Sundays at the chapels
of thß Disciples. John Tyler was, I
think, a Presbyterian, though his sec
ond wife was a Catholic. Dolly Madi
son was an Episcopalian, whatever her
husband may have been, and the old
church which she attended years ago
still stands, and in it President Arthur
worships today.

EFFECT OF WATER STORAGE
Would Mean Great Mining
Development. .
MINERAL WEALTH DEPENDENT UPON IRRIGATION
Reclaiming Lands For Settlement.—
Even Artesian Well Water "
Is Enriching;.
A great share of the West is today
almost as much an undiscovered
country, as it was before the cry of'
gold . -was heara f rom California.
Mountains of untold richnesss lie un
developed and desolate, surrounded by*
burning plains and barren wastes.
Not only gold but the baser metals are
locked in countless tons in the rocky
bosoms of the western sierras. And
why are they not mined? Why does
not capital flow in to make the boulder
and the earth unburden' their treas
ures for man's use? Why? Because
of lack of water; Because of lack of
transportation. Torrents of immense
volume rush down the slopes' during
the period of melting of snows and
spread away ; in * glistering streams
through the brown valleys or over
broader plains, out in a little while
their volume wanes and anon they are
but dry beds of sand, supporting no
life nor growth.' Yet were the vast
bulk of this waste water stored in
mountain reservoirs it -would afford a
perennial supply, capable of irrigating
millions of acres of land whose great
fertility has lain dry aud dormant for
thousands of years.' Then would
the mines be developed? In sec
tions where irrigation has forced its
way, there railroads, have gladly fol
lowed, and with, the soil yielding the
necessaries of life to man anil beast in
abundance and with cheap transporta
tion at band, mines have been devel
oped and added millions to the mineral
output, which otherwise would have
lain dormant forever.
The statement that the saying, ''Go
West, young man," has lost its po
tency and its force, could never be
made for many years to come, if a pol
icy of internal improvement should be
adopted which would water the mill
ions of acres of Western public land
now lying arid. As
"All that tread the globe are but a hand-full
To the tribes that slumber in its bosom,"
so the present population of the great
West is but a vanguard of the multi
tudes of Industrious workers who
build up beautiful homes and rear
happy families, were tho wators which
now go to the sea in prodigal waste,
but stored by the government and
used to reclaim the fertile lands which
today support only the cactus and the
horned toad.' A striking instance of
what has been accomplished in the
West and what possibilities lie await
ing development, may be found in Cali
fornia, . which with all its great agri
cultural wealth, has .still 58,000,000
acres of government land, more than
half the area of the State and 17,000,
000 of which are susceptable of.irriga
tion. Yet the city of Chicago has to
day a larger population than California.
The inexhaustable fertility of many
irrigated fields is a source of consider
able wonder to the farmer dependent
upon rain for his crops, and who must
each year apply large quantities of
fertilizer tp his fields in order to pro
duce good yields if not to prevent ab
solute soil exhaustion. This phenom
enon of irrigation is easily explained.
Analysis of the waters of various rivers
and springs and even artesian wells
show a constituency of certain chemi
cals which form the bulk of plant
food, such, for instance, as potash and
nitrogen. From French experiments
it is concluded that an acre of land irri
gated with the quantiy of water gener
ally used in France would receive there
from as much potash as - would be fur
nished by an application of thirty loads
of ordinary stable manure. In some
cases experiments have shown that the
mineral substances supplied .by the
water were in excess pf. the needs of
the crop. In all water which comes
from diversions of rivers pr storage
reservpirs there is an addition to chem
ical constituency of plant fuod, mo.ro or
less solid matter. The mud pr ooze
held In suspension ■in irrigation waters
and supplied by them to the soil cannot
fail to add to its fertility. Thus irriga
ed water is a constant source of enrich
ment and fields which have been water
ed for hundreds of years are as produc
tice and fertile one year after another,
for the application of water supplies
them with both food and drink.
Under J the ma_gUj jtiss" gf the mfiun
t#in stream, fed tjy the melting snows,
the brown desert of the great Arid
West' becomes the Held of waving
grain, the golden orchard or the pur
ple vineyard of a thriving and popu
lous community. ■ -;
AMADQR LODE SYSTEM.
The Little Amador Mine the Second
Quart* Mine Worked }n California.
y. ' [BY JOHN A. FAPU..[
The socpnd cju^rtz m|ne wprkod in
Calif prnia was th,e Qrjginal Amadpr,
more generally known "as the Little
Amador mine. This mine adjoins the
Spring Hill location on Amador creek,
running to the north a full claim in
length. The lode formation here was
very much as that described in the
Spring Hill or hanging wall.yeip pf the
Keystone fissure. In' this mine, how
ever, fhere'was'but one regular ledge
or vein. For 380 feet in depth the
quartz was of a high grade, the wall
regular with a dip pf sixty : fiye degrees
to the east. The. hanging wall here
became broken from the effect of a
cross-dike shattering the main north
and south dike disrupting the lode,
which became impoverished, the quartz
and slates becoming shuttered and the
gold-bearing material so diffused that
it did not pay profitably in its oper
ations. Here, however, is one of the
evidences so often met with in this
great lode .or vein system, the lack of
Minkiiiff to a great depth and a proper
series of crosscuts .being run. Too
much has been taken for granted with
out thorough developments. We know
that the gold was not dropped into
these fissures from a bird's wing, and
there is every reason to believe that
the gold-bearing rocks will descend as
deep into tho earth as the slate uplift
or t tilt, whichever may be choston as
the most preferable theory. The gold
bearing rocks are wide and long,
filled with pyritic matter, which in
most cases is a crystallized sponge of
sulphur, if I may be 'allowed' to »so
that^torm, which is. the base of .this
pyritic matter, acting as it did as a
web for the deposit of the metalloids it
has gathered the gold particles which
are found in a state of what we call
fine quartz gold, which when examined
under tho microscope are found to be
tetrahedrons. Indeed, it is doubtful
whether tho. crystal of sulphur can be
found on the line of these rocks that
does not carry more or less gold.. In
order to more thoroughly understand
the nature of the gold-bearing rocks
we must. deal a little with technical
terms, and since like formations
throughout tho world produce like
sold deposits, I will enumerate a few —
hornblendic, micaceous schists, feldspar,
soda-feldspar, lime-feldspar, orthoclase,
gneissoid, diorite dike, syenite and
gneiss schists, mica-schists, talc-schists.
These are conditions generally found,
evidence of which we find in the mines
under consideration, but uo formation
so far as we know has been developed
anywhere that promises such great
depth as the slates and syenites of our
California system. Hence,, the justi
fication for sinking deep shafts on our
lode line. - .
Speaking to the point: The section
now under consideration we find the
lode broken; the eastern wall fractured
and splintered, presenting the features
of disturbances, with its mineralized
conditions above enumerated.
The Bunker Hill mine, which adjoins
the Amador on the north, has some of
the features herein described. The
granite wall, however, partakes more
of the gnessic granite, or, perhaps, I
might more properly describe it as a
granite porphyry. In this inifto the
body of- quariz when found nexi to
the hanging wall is in shingle form;
that is to say, there is no continuous
shoot, but a cab-like scries of forma
tions Ssh-shapod, head against tail
and vice versa; these are not uniform
ly profitable auriferous deposits. There
are particularly few of this number
that are regular in shape. Tho value
where the blue slate, rocks are found is
often highly cleaved and bodies qf
quartz have been found rjoh.
In the interest of economical develop
ment, where delving into the everlast
ing hills for fortune is the object of
man's toil, I would recommend careful
study and intelligent activity.

The many and
.., \ -~ remarkable cures
 . resulting from the
use of "Golden Medical Discovery"
prove the soundness of Dr. Pierces the-
ory that in these days of haste and hurry
the stomach is the common • breeding
place of disease. These cures also prove
the soundness of Dr. Pierces reasoning
that "diseases which originate in the
stomach must be cured through the
stomach." The " Discovery "is a medi-
cine for the stomach and other organs of
digestion and nutrition. When the
stomach is healthy the blood made in
the stomach is healthy, and sufficient in
quantity to nourish the nerves and
strengthen the system to resist or throw
off disease. Nature develops life, sus-
tains life _and preserves life by nourish-,
ment. Vital failure comes when the
body is starved either from lack of food
or die inability of the digestive and nu-
tritive organs to extract the nourishment
from the food taken into the stomach.
" Golden Medical Discovery " takes the
obstacles from Nature's way so that she
can sustain life by her own methods. .
Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets assist the
action of "Golden Medical Discovery."

BRYAN AT SACRAMENTO.
.. Wm. J. Bryan, the great Democratic Moses from Ne
braska, orated in Sacramento last Monday night. The elo
quent apostle of Democracy was greeted with a large audience,
■but he failed to present anything new of enticing. The feast
savored strongly of chestnuts, and was simply a rehash of his
stereotyped arraignment of the Republican party. It is not
likely that this chief of the 16 to i policy will ever succeed in
'extricating himself from the tangle he has got hiinsel into.
The more he argues the dead questions the farther he gets
from the White House, and the deeper he plunges his paity
into the quagmire of political disaster.!";
The key notes of his speech were: First, "Objection to
anything and everything the Republican party stands for."
Second, "The Silver Question." Third, "The Trusts."
Fourth, "Imperialism and the Philippine policy."
.The first point it is not necessary to notice. His opinion
of the Republican party has never been exalted. The silver
question is a dead issue, and is so considered by the leading
Democrats of the country. The trust question Mr. Bryan
well knows cannot be forced into a political issue. As to
"imperialism" and the Philippine policy, everybody knows
that the cry of imperialism has no warrant, and that it is
simply the wail of demagogues.' It is also well knowu that
the Philippine policy is "undetermined further than this that
the Republican party stands for the retention of the new pos
sessions and for providing them with such right form of gov
ernment as they are fitted to receive. It purposes to accord
them full meed of freedom ; and all human rights. It pro
poses that they shall be self-governing to the full capacity of
their people to be self-governors." V* ■ -
Thus we see that Mr. Bean's overwhelming (?) argu
. ments, amount to just so much chaff, and a very poor article
at that, but it may serve to blind the eyes of his deluded fol
lowers until after President McKinley is triumphantly
reelected. r^ v /; -
-iIC. P. Huntington,' President of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company, returned to San Francisco, accompanied
by Mrs. Huntington, last Tuesday night, after an absence of
ten months. They will remain until the middle of May,
occupying their palatial home on California street. In speak
ing of the future of California, Mr. Huntington in a recent
, interview gave utterance to the following words which are too
true to be passed carelessly by: "I never indulge in proph
ecy," said Mr. Huntington in response to a request for his
opinion as to California's future, "because no man can lay
out a plan with assurance that it will succeed. California's
. future is dependent upon California's people. They have
exceptional advantage of climate and geographical position,
but these amount to nothing if the proper popular spirit is
lacking. . I Will go farther than that aud say that California's
future is dependent upon the individual intelligence and.
energy of its citizens. If every young man in the State were
to apply his ability to a single life purpose the prosperity of
all would be guaranteed. George Crabbe wrote, 'Let each
one mind one and all are minded then.' Continuous thought
and work on one line is bound to win. With fair ability and
steady application a man can accomplish almost anything.
Versatility is. not an enviable characteristic always. The
great men of the world have been men with one idea."
There have been some startliug developments in the
. Goebel assassination case sinee >our last issue. It was ru
mored that W. H. Culton had made a confession, but his
friends who are in his confidence say that his statement was
not in the nature of a confession, but they admit that he gave
the prosecution information of a startling nature which had
heretofore not come out. Powers is not considered the actual
assassin, but he is believed to have conspired with a view of
Goebel's death.
President McKinley no doubt regrets the failure of
his tender of. the good offices of this government to Great
Britain to assist in bringing about peace in South Africa/but
recognizes that Lord Salisbury had a right to decline the, ten
der on behalf of his government. The general impression is
that nothing else can or will be done by this government, and
that the language of Lord Salisbury's declination is in effect
a strong hint to European nations not to attempt mediation.
There is a regular rush for charters4br National Banks,
with capital of $25,000, in towns of less than 3,000 inhabit
ants authorized by the new financial law. Great care is being
exercised by ,the Controller of the Currency in approving the
application for this class of charters.

Shenandoah, Valley, March 28, '00.
An entertainment was given at the
school house last Saturday evening
under the management of Professor F.
M. Nbrris for the. purpose oi raising
funds to procuru v Dag. It was a great
success socially, and financially sur
passed the expectations of those who
bad the enterprise most at heart.
The partition between the two rooms
of the school house had been removed,
the stage occupying the ontire space
of the smallor one, while thelargor ono
was crammed to the door, many of the
auditors having to stand. Spectators
were present from Plymouth, Auk urn,
Bridgeport and Drytown, tbo latter
town being represented by the "Can
and Will" society of that school.
The audience, though crowded to dis
comfort, was good-natured and thor
oughly enjoyed t ho entire programme,
which was well chosen and excellently
rendered.
The programme opened with the
solo "The Hoodo Man" by Todd C.
Woodworth of Plymouth. A dialogue
by two little tots, Dora and Jenniu
Smith followed and then the farce,
"Which is Which" was presented with
the following cast of characters:

500 level will be milled, probably at
the Wildraan-Mahoney mill. His the
intention of Superintendent Voorheis
to crush from 500 to 1000 tons of the
rock.
Oneida— Jackson-
Progress is the word at the Oneida
mine. Superintendent' Truscott and
his force are earryiny for ward the. work
with tbo speed commensurate with" first
class work. Work at the old and new
shafts is satisfactory in every respect.
The material for the 60-stamp mill is
being placed on the ground with as
much dispatch as possible. .
Spagnoli— Clinton.
Superintendent Fisher reports favor
ably of the outlook' at the Spagnoli
mine. A 2-foot vein of quartz has been
encountered which will go about' six
dollars. Drifting is being done on a
ledge, but not the main one and the
outlook is rather encouraging.
Centennial— Drytown.
Superintendent L. A. Gross, of the
Centennial mine, is down 600 feet, and is
drifting north and soutb. A fair sam
ple of rock' from this mine was exhi bited
in town Wednesday by Hon. A. Cami
netti, who is interested in the property.
Amador King— Jackson.
Five men are at work in the Amador
King tunnel, and those interested claim
that the prospects are bright. - . ■'■'
Kirkwood— Jackson.
The books of the Kirk wood Mining
Co. are open and considerable stock has
been subscribed for. Thcfspecimens of
rock on exhibition indicate a future for
the enterprise and many shares of stock
will go to local parties. ;
Peerless— Jackson.
Work at the Peerless mine is going
forward as usual, without any hitch or
drawback. Superintendent. Osbornt' is
apparently as sanguin as> ever that he is
in the right spot and that the proper
depth will s bring forth plenty of divi
dend paying rock.
South Eureka— Sutter.
Activity seems to bo. the: watchword
at the South Eureka. Evidently some
• thing quite encouraging has taken
place, for new vim and enlarged' fauili
tlee are, we understand, tho order.
Central Eureka- Sntter.
The general oplnon hereabouts among
mine owners and mining men is," that
tho Central Eureka mine is one of the
best prospects in this raining section at
the present. Considerable ': stock
changed hands here this week at a. fair
price. Work on the mill - site is now
under way.
Kennedy— Jackson.
The new east shaft of the Kennedy
mine Is going down at the rate of
eighty-five feet a month. Most excel
lent work is being done and Superin
tendent Parks is much pleased with the
progress being made. The mine proper
is running full handed and the forty
stamps unceasingly hammer out the
precious metal. .[...•
Argonaut— Jackson. ~
J The regular force and regular output
| is the word from tho Argona.ut mine.
Fremont— Amador.
The shaft at the Fremont is being
sunk from fifteen to twenty feet a week.
■ The shaft is flooded with water and it
has been necessary to keep a pump
- constantly in action.
Tody Mine.
At the Tody mine, located about two
- miles north of the Gwin, the old tunnel
j la being cleaned out in order that the
property may be thoroughly examined
with a view of resuming operations if
the examination justifies it.
Catharine— West Point.
Stewart & Za valla will have: their
mine unwatered by April Ist, and sink

Their newly completed hoist works to a
charm, and the Catherine is expected to
yield some good metal .in the near
future. ; ' ■ r-' '.;'. .
CALAVERAS COUNTY.
Mountain Echo: The water has all
been pumped out of the Union mine at
Copperopolis, and new pipes, pump and
' track is being put in the mine, pre
paratory to resuming work in the ore
stopes. As soon as everything is' in
readiness for active . operations, the
working force will be increased to
about 100 men.
Chronicle: ; At the Gwin mino opera
- tions continue as smoothly as ever and
the management has no fault to find
with the showing of that most excel
lent property. The ore is low grade
but thej are putting through the mill
an average of 500 tons daily, which re
sults entirely satisfactory. . :- ; •■;■
The GuifTra mill closed down last
Wednesday till such time as a shaft
. can be sunk 100 feet below the tunnel.
'John Guiffra has . taken the contract
for twenty feet. Mr. Wynn has gone
Ito Nevada where he has mining inter
ests. He is expected to return in two
weeks, when the mill will again be
put to crushing quartz. ■ ;; .
The McNear mine on Table Moun
tain is giving promise of being one of
the most substantial gravel proposi
. tions in Calaveras. It is on a blue
gravel channel which can be traced for
many miles through this county.
Large operations in the way of devel
opment .are, we understand, about to
be inaugurated. • •. ;
John Jackson, who has - been work
ing the Little Giant mine, an adjoining
location to the Hazel Dell in Rich Gulch
district, made a recent crushing .of
eight tons of rock which yielded $450.

in another giant last Monday in front
of the Stickle shaft, to be used in case
of fire either at the shaft or the lumber
yard. '•■'• ■ '" • '-:'.-" V•;

Brown's Addition mine next to the
Lost Log had some very promising
prospects taken from it, as also has
the Eppereon mine in which a tunnel is
being driven by Expert Jennings, a
miner of sixty years experience. He

' A. Macomber of Jenny Lind has un
covered by tunnel and shaft the main
east vein of the Plymouth Rock mine.

dicating its juncture at some nua,r dis
tance in the vicinity, with similar rock
io the Plymouth Rock. Someofitbas

the mine the drifting on lines prev
iously outlined in these columns con
tinue*, without any 'apparent change
in the character of the rock. Mr. Gut
mann is enthusiastic about the outlook
and predicts that the Ford will yet be
come one of the great producers of the
county.
Nothing but good reports come from
the Sheep Ranch, where heavy bodies
of very high-grado ore have been en
countered in the deep levels.
At the Calaveras mine, formerly the
Lucas, they are sinking a winze fifty
feet and the 10-stamp mill is kept in
constant operation on a fine grade of
ore. .
The Demarest continues to make fine
clean-ups and the rich ore chute is
maintained as it is followed downward.
There are rumors that the main shaft
is to be sunk 200 feet more, from 600 to
800. :- - '■'
In the ! Vorlander mine, at Mokel

should cordially greet the capitalists
who propose building it and show more
appreciation. He thinks a public meet

marks of good will should 'be forth
coming from our people. He does not
believe in getting in the way of the

work of permanent advancement.

Jack Kenney Expires From
Its Effect.
PUT IN A BLAST OF SIX HOLES, BUT TWO FAILED
After a Reasonable Delay, They Went
' > Into the Tunnel to Reload the
Holes That Hissed.
• A sad affair - occurred at Jackson
Butte mine,' owned by R. L. Marsh,'
last Sunday afternoon, resulting in the
death of one man and the close call of
another. It appears that Jack Ken
ney and ■ W. T A. Kennedy, mining part
ners, put In "a blast of six holes in the
tunnel, only four of which exploded,
two of them turning out to bo what is
known in mining parlance as "stink
ors.." ■ After a . time Kennedy went in
and - reconnmtored and ~ found i£ the
• powder, smoke too thick for safety.'
He came out of the tunnel and waited
for' sortie time and then made a second
attempt but failed. Later, he went
in and fanned the smoke out and he
and Kenney then concluded it was safe
to clean out the two holes and reload
them. They went in together, and
while Kennedy fanned the' smoke away
with an o}d coat Kenney cleaned 'out
the holes.' When the holes were*cldan,
both set to work to load them, b\it be
fore the job was finished Kennedy was
overcome by the powder smoke and
Kenney after trying in vain to get him
out alone, rushed out for help and he
was shortly after rescued.
While Mr. j and Mrs. Marsh- and
others, including Konney, were en
gaged in resuscitating" Kennedy, his
partner, Kenney, suddenly complained
of feeling faint and took a small swal
low of camphor. He died almost im
mediately after doing so.
On Monday, March 26th, Coroner
Gritton held an Inquest on the body,'
the jury finding that the deceased was
named Jack Kenney; was a native of
Illinois, aged about 43 years; that he
came to his death on the 25th day of
March, 1900, by inhaling^ poisonous
gases from burnt nitro-gljcerine pow
der while at his work in the Jackson
Butte mine. The- jury was composed
of the following citizens: John T.
Kelley, Harry Ashe, P. L. Cassineli,
Thomas W. Bosanko, J. S. Avise, N.

«wm a««i««r.THE CHARIOT OF OLD
A GRIM REMINDER OF THE COMBATS
OF THE HEROIC PERIOD.
ThU Vehicle 'Was Used In the Days
, of Antiquity For the Battle, the
Cbase, In Processions and :In
Games— How It 'Was Constructed.
The chariot was used In antiquity
for the battle, the cbase, in public pro
cessions and in games. It had two
wheels and was drawn by two horses,
and when one or two horses were add
ed they were attached to each side of
the main pair by a side trace, fastened
to the front of the chariot • .
These chariots have only come down
to us in fragments, with the exception
of the one in the archaeological muse
um of Florence, which Is a unique ex
ample of a war chariot, the so called
"Biga dl Frassino," found by Rossell
neo in a Thebes tomb. It is certainly
as old as the fourteenth century B. C.
It is probably a trophy obtained In the
north by some Egyptian warrior.
There Is an entire absence of metal
In the construction. Immediately on
the axle, without springs of any kind,
rests the basket or body, of the chari
ot, which consisted of a floor to stand
on and a semicircular guard around
the front and about half the height of
the driver.' ' It Is entirely open at the
back, so that the combatants might
leap to the ground and up again, as be
came necessary by the exigencies of
action. There was no Beat, and gener
ally In war chariots there was only
room for the combatant and his chari
oteer to stand in. \ ■
The pole, as in the present instance,
was usually, attached to the middle of
the axle, although to outward appear
ances It looked as though It sprang
from the front of tbe basket. At the
end of the pole was the yoke, which
looked like a ram's horns. Depending
from this by leather thongs was a V
shaped piece, which probably took
tbe place of the modern horse collar.
Probably broad bands were also fitted
around the chest of tbe animals.
Besides the harness of each horse
there were a bridle and a pair of reins
somewhat In the same style as are In
useatthe present day. These weremade
of leather and were ornamented with
studs of Ivory and metal. The reins
were passed through rings attached
to the collar and were- long enough to
be tied around the waist of the chariot
eer In case of bis having to defend him
self. . . ;
The wheels and body were usually of
wood, strengthened in places with
bronze or Iron. The wheels had from
four to eight spokes, ,and the tires
were of bronze or iron (in the preswrit
Instance ash was used), and the pins
which secured tbe fellies were of fossil
bone. ■
This description applied to the chari
ots of almost any of tbe nations of an
'tiqulty, the difference consisting chief
ly in the mountings. Thus the chariots
of the Egyptians and Assyrians, with
whom the bow was the principal arm
of attack, were richly mounted with
quivers full -of arrows, while those of
the Greeks, who used the spear, were
plain except as regards mere decora
tions. The Persians and the ancient
Britons used a class of chariots having
the wheels mounted with sharp, sickle
shaped blades, which cut to pieces
whatever came in their way. This was
probably the invention of the Persians.
The use of the battle chariot really
belongs to the heroic period. The war
rior, standing by the side of bis chariot-,
eer, was driven in front of the- line to*
Invite hostile warriors to single com
bat . After the strategic skill of a com
mander superseded the demands |on
his personal valor the chariot was
transferred from tbe battlefield to the
hippodrome, where alone its original
f o%a was preserved. The description
of the Homeric battle chariot, there
fore, to a great extent also applies' to
the historic chariot of the race course.
■ The small diameter of the chariot
wheel may be explained from the de
sire of preventing the chariot from be
ing opposed by the impediments In the
battlefield, such as debris or dead bod
ies. The rim was usually formed of
four fellies, into which tbe four spokes
were let. The upper rail, which was of
either wood or metal, varied greatly in
form and was Intended to be grasped
. by the warrior on jumping on to the
chariot, while the front part served for
fastening tbe reins and the. traces of
the "wheel horses." In the Roman tri
umphal chariot a covering of leather
served to ward off missiles, and later
. on the sides were composed of strong
boards. . •
h Unfortunately we know very little of
the vehicles of everyday use in those
days. . They nearly all seem to be a va
riety of what we now term the "gig."—

Killed Classical Quotations.
In tracing the decline of the use of
classic:^ quotations In legislative bod
ies the Boston Herald cites the case of
Edward Everett, who once concluded
a stately speech In congress with a
long, sonorous and superbly modulated
citation of a passage from Tacitus and
then took his seat. No sooner was be
through than up sprang a burly mem
ber from what was then a frontier
state of the west He bad once been
an Indian agent, and no sooner was he
on his legs than he began to pour out
a vehement harangue in Choctaw.
After awhile the speaker called him to
order.' j
"I don't see why my freedom of
speech should be abridged!" he cried.
"You let the gentleman from Massa
chusetts run on, and I didn't under
stand the first word of his lingo any
better than he does mine."
The scene was described as very
comical, but It struck the deathknell
of further classical quotations In a
congress that had not the ray of an
idea what the unintelligible lingo of
Cicero and Tacitus was driving at
His Story "Goes" Until He Does.
There Is In Cowley county a big two
fisted farmer who has the reputation
of. being the biggest liar In the town

Into Dexter and told that be bad a

Proud of Hla Labels.
A distangy looking young man board
ed a Fourteenth street car at Massa
chusetts avenue the other night He
was' carrying & leather suit case.
Pasted all over the suit case were la
bels indicating much foreign travel —
steamer pasters slapped on at Dieppe,
Havre, Ostend, Bremen, Cherbourg,
Liverpool, Yarmouth, Naples, and rail
road labels that bore the names of all
lines all the way from Constantinople
to St Petersburg. The j-oung man of
distangy. appearance put the suit case
down between his legs, and all the peo
ple In the soats opposite began a fas
cinated sort of inspection of the labels.
A stout man with several of the com
ponent parts of a Jag who sat next to
the young man seemed to regard the
labels . with particular Interest. He
stooped over and deciphered them
carefully and elaborately, and then he
looked up at the owner of the suit
case with a leer.
""Been around right smart, hain't
you, podner?" he Inquired.
The young man regarded him with a
smile.
"Never, been farther away from
Washington' than New York in my
life," he replied, without any hesita
tion whatsoever. "I got that whole
bunch of labels for half a dollar at a
little money exchanging joint, down
near the Battery, In New York. Hot
scheme, Isn't It?"
The frankness of the statement so
dazed several of the passengers who
overheard it that they got off at the
wrong theater.— Washington Post
The Stan; Beetle.
As you walk by tbe hedgeside a
strange noise suddenly arrests your at
tention. It Is the buzz of an insect,
but loud enough to startle you. It
might be mistaken for the reeling of a
night Jar, but It Is perhaps more like
the Jarring bum of a fastly driven mo
tor car.
The reason of the noise is that the
beetle has with great pains climbed up
a certain height from the ground, and
In order to ascertain whether he has
got far enough, he erects himself on
his stand, lifts his wing cases, shakes
out his wings and begins to agitate
them violently, turning this way and
that to make sure that he has a clear
space.
If he then attempts to fly— it Is one
of his common blunders— he instantly
strikes against some branch or cluster
of leaves ans] is thrown down. The
tumble does not hurt him' In the least,
but so greatly astonishes him that he
remains motionless a good while; then,
recovering his senses, he begins to as
cend again. At length, after a good
many accidents and adventures by the
way, he gets on to the topmost twig,
and, after some buzzing, to get up
steam, launches himself heavily, on the
air and goes ' away In grand style.—
Longman's.
Looking Ont For Alma Mater.
No doubt the casual observer has of
ten noticed how unceasingly bequests
flow Into the treasuries of certain uni
versities, but he may not know that
the alumni of those Institutions, partic
ularly the lawyers, have it always on
their minds to secure, or at least to
suggest, bequests.
One of these men, a prominent cor
poration lawyer of this city, was speak
ing of the custom the other day. He
explained that a lawyer and his client
usually sit down to talk over the gen
eral subject of a will. If tlie client lias
more than enough money to meet the
actual needs of his family, he common
ly says something of charitable or edu
cational Institutions, generally In a
vague way, which makes it quite nat
ural for his lawyer to suggest as a def
inite object his own alma mater. The
lawyer referred to had himself secured
several bequests, one of them for the
sum of $300,000. "But," said he, smil
ing, "a young lawyer In my office has
Just cut me out of $100,000, which he
put In a. will for his own alma' mater.
It was a very good stroke on his part,
the more so because our respective uni
versities have been bitter athletic . ri
vals for years."— New York Mail and

Bother Cold Blooded.
Of the tactics of infantry there Is
no end, but there are some simple
rules for tbe individual foot soldier to
remember when lost In the chaos of
battle. If you cannot bayonet your
enemy, shoot him. If he goes away,
aim at tbe base of his spine. But do
not let your attention be distracted
from business by tbe consideration
that other people are making a mark
of you. It is your duty to kill the
highest possible number of those op
posed to you, not to save your own

THE AMADOB LEDfiER: JACKSON. CALIFORNIA.. FRIDAY. MARCH 30. 1900.
After a Battle.
In the first aid that is rendered: on
the field after a battle nothing is at
tempted beyond the arrest of.hemor
rhage, the application of temporary
splints for fractures and antiseptic
dressing. There is no washing or ex
ploration of wounds. The clothes are
merely slit up with scissors,* not re
moved, thus insuring protection to the
patient's body and saving unnecessary
disturbances. The sergeant In charge
of the collection station has a field
companion, a water bottle and a small
reserve of bandages and first dress
ings'in bis care to replenish the sur
gical haversacks with which the bear
ers are supplied.
Triangular bandages are chiefly used
on the battlefield, made from a 3S Inch
square of linen or calico, cut diagonal
ly into halves. Almost anything that
comes to band may be used as Impro
vised splints— sticks, telegraph wire,
bark of trees, straw, rifles, bayonets,
lances and so on. The splint, if neces
sary, is padded with straw or leaves
or grass and is fastened with straps
torn from the soldier's equipment or
with strips of a shirt, securely bound
with the triangular bandage. Bound
up with the rifle splint, a wounded
man Is made so secure that he can
hardly - move a muscle. One leg Is
firmly bound to the rifle, and the an
kles are tied together, so that the In
jured limb Is almost as rigid as the
rifle at Its side. — London Standard.
A Cheerful Liar.
"I have followed trout streams ever
since I was a boy," said a Providence
crank, "and have tried to solve for
many years the cause of the apparent
decrease In brook trout. Recently I
think I discovered the cause of the ex
termination. I was fishing along a
brook near Oakland Beach, R. 1., when
I saw a large snake with a half masti
cated trout in its mouth. . The action
of the suake interested me, and, stand-
Ing quietrl studied the snake closely.
."On the end of the snake's tail was a
sharp bony growth shaped like a hook.
After a few moments my watching
was rewarded by seeing the snake
glide over to some bushes growing
along the bank and catch a grasshop
per In Its mouth. The snake then
placed . the grasshopper carefully on
the hooklike thing on the end of Its
tail.
"By this time my curiosity was thor
oughly aroused," continued the fisher
man. "The spake crawled up on a log
that extended from the bank Into the
brook and let its tail bang into the wa
ter. In a moment up came a trout
and 'snapped at the grasshopper. It
was short work for the snake to trans
fer tbe fish from its tall to its mouth,
and I had solved the problem of the ex
termination of brook trout."— Cleve-

Tempering Copper Not a l<ost Art.
The allegation that ancient Egyptians
tempered copper and bronze to carry a
razor edge is not borne out by Investi
gation. Thomas Harper of Bellevue.
Pa., challenges any one to produce a
piece of metal tempered by thi? an
cients that cannot be more than dupli
cated by any metal worker today. He
says that in examining buqdrpds of
specimens alleged to have been temper
ed to the degree that steel Is tempered
lie failed to find any, nor bad he dis
covered any one who had ' seen sucU
work, and the fable which lists beeu
implicitly believed for centuries is be
ing shattered in the light of modern re
search.
This Is not the ouly story believed for
centuries tending to belittle the man of
today, to make him the Inferior of his
forefathers, which failed .under the
searchlight of Inquiry and science. The
ancients were children in mechanical
knowledge as compared to the people
of today, and if there was a clenwn<l
for any particular buildinjr or piece of
work such as was produced by the on
cients it could be duplicated and im
proved on by the skilled artisans of the
nineteenth century.— American Manu

Not Self Hade.
"I am sorry to disappoint you. young
man," said the great railway magnate
to the reporter who had called in for
the purpose of writing him up, "but
I did not begin at the bottom and
