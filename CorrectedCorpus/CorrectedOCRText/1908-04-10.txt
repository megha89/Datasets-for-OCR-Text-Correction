THE PRINTING RTES
For he firs ime during he pas eleen years he board of
superisors of his couny a he regular meeing his week
underook a horough reision of he schedule of couny
prining raes For years he Ledger has been urging he
necessiy for such acion, poining ou he many and glaring
defecs in he old raes, hrough which he couny has been
icimized, and which in seeral insances were ambiguous
and capable of a double inerpreaion  he March mee
ing of he board he course of acion o be pursued in arri
ing a he rae for each iem of , prining was definiely de
cided upon, namely, ha each priner should be furnished
by he clerk wih a lis of prining required by he arious
officers, he o fill in afer each iem he price for which he
would be willing o do such work From he liss so fur
nished he board would selec he lowes price gien on each
separae iem, and esablish ha as he rae for ha paricu
lar aricle Wihou some undersanding of his sor he
filling ou of he liss would hae been a meaningless farce,
and as far as he Ledger was concerned i was plainly inim
aed ha i would be useless o ake any par herein unless
some rule of his kind was adoped We anicipaed ha
effors would be made o preen his policy from being
carried ou in he ineres of pary poliics, and in his we
were no misaken Before he board me and during he
session of he board influences were brough o bear o moe
he superisors from he pah mapped ou — o adop he low
es raes on some iems and he higher raes on ohers, sim
ply o bolser up he democraic organ hrough he couny
reasury The sheriff and he couny clerk ook a hand in
he discussion agains uome of he figures submied by he
Ledger, bu no a proes was raised a a soliary iem sub
mied by he ispach Bu he scheme was oo ransparen
o deceie any one, and he board refused o budge one ioo
from is preiously announced deerminaion o accep he
lowes price in eery insance nd his hey did so far as
hey were able o judge from he eidence The lis from he
Ledger office was he lowes, wih a few unimporan excep
ions, and herefore conrolled he esablishmen of raes, ou
side of he isolaed excepions This is • he firs genuine
moe in he direcion of proecing he axpayers agains ex
orionae prining charges ha has been made for years
The amoun saed o he couny by he reised schedule will
amoun o seeral hundred dollars per year On one iem
alone — prining he grea regiser — he saing will amoun
o $150 nd in no case has he reised lis, so far as he
Ledger office has helped o shape i, reduced he price below
a fair margin of profi We do no beliee ha any prining
will be diered by he new schedule from he prining
office preferred by he respecie couny officers according o
heir indiidual poliical affiliaion There will probably
be one noable excepion, where a fla rae is gien for a
cerain piece of work ha allows less han 15c per 1000 ems
of composiion, wih nohing for press work or sock This was
a case where here was solid ground for a igorous kick
on accoun of saraion raes — he recognized basis of charge
hroughou he Unied Saes for composiion alone, wheher
machine or hand work, ranging from 80 cens o $1 per 1000
ems Tha price, s needless o say, was no pu in by he
Ledger, bu by he ispach, and [he eiden inenion was
o seer work from he firsnamed o he lasnamed office I
will mos assuredly hae ha effec We made no proes
afhis manifesly absurd rae Being he lowes we admi
ha i should be adoped like he res
The aderising raes are lef unchanged, 25 cens per
square for each inserion We are free o admi ha his is
a much lower rae han perains in mos oher counies I
has been he rae here for wele years To he Ledger be
longs he credi or discredi of keeping i a ha rae his
