Almond Culture in Amader County
It has been demonstrated by S C
Wheeler of Plymouth that tlie almond
industry is a profitable business Mr
Wheeler's farm is located two miles
east of Plymouth, < at the foot of the
ridge before entering Shecandoah Val
ley He has 220 bearing alnjond trees
of arious arieties They are ten
years old, and commenced to bear the
fourth year Last season two tons of
nuts were harested from this orchard,
and were readily sold at terj cents a
pound to a local market; thus realiz
ing $400 off of two and one half acres of
land This crop was produced without
irrigation The trees hae neer been
irrigated at any time since they were
planted The trees neer hae re
ceied any extra care such as spraying,
etc Pruning and plowing twice in a
season has been all the attention that
the orchard has receied It is well
known that almonds find a ready
market at any time, 'and are easily
packed and shipped
The soil on which these trees are
grown is in common with the land in
that portion of the county, and thou ,
sand ot acres of such land could be put
to a profitable use $160 an acre is
what this orchard is paying its owner
eery year What industry can make
a better showing than this? We' hope
the farmers of Amador will profit by
Mr Wheeler's example and experience
by taking up this important industry,
and share in its reenue and the com
forts incidental to a well filled purse

JACKSON, Cal, June 3, 1903 } j
To the Subscribers and StockholdersPersonal—
The Supt reports for the two months
ending May 31st as followsPersonal
Total crosscut tunnel run in two
months, 67 feet
Total cost, $97764
Cost per foot, $1474
Total working time, 42 days of two
shifts
 Total length of iiiunel June Ist, 788 ft
Upraise and drifts in old works/
$12220
Roads and ditches, $7000
Water for two months, $100
Superintendence, general, $100
Work on the crosscut tunnel has
continued in extremely hard formation
for the last 75 feet, the rock proing so
refractory that with our Utmost efforts
we hae at times almost despaired of
being able to penetrate it Our New
Ingersoll drill, 'which represents* the
highest efficiency of piston drill, was
unable to meet the requirements in the
hard rock, so we made a test of the
new 5 Model Water Leyner drill Upon
securing proper equipment for operat
ing this drill, we beliee that we will be
enabled to secure greater efficiency and
at reduced expense
The high footage cost shown by the
last two month's work is explained by
the increasing difficulty in dealing with
rock of extreme hardness, at a con
siderable distance under ground; the
greater distance required to tram the
waste causing an increase of fuotage
cost
The superintendent reports that, the
last shifts, operating with the Leyner
drill, made encouraging progress,
owing to the higher efficiency of the
drills and the improing character of
the rock, which in the last eight feet
has become lighter and more easily
worked
The consensus of opinion among
miners here is that the hard reef of
quartzite just passed through is an en
couraging indication, and that good
alues should exist back of such a
formation The appearance of the
rock in the last eight feet shows the
laminations of such a trend as to indi
cate the approach to a ledge The
same conclusions may be deried from
the increasing moisture at the face
We regret to be obliged to report
the destruction of our blacksmith shop
and A considerable portion of its con
tents by fire, on the night of June 30th
about 12 o'clock, while the night shift
was on duty The cause of the' fire is
unknown, but it was probably due to
the igniting of waste from a candle
snuff left by one of the men The loss
will not exceed $500 
The regular meeting of the stock
holders of the company will be held on
Monday, July 6, 1903, at 2 o'clock pm
Respectfully submitted,
Jas Jay Wright,

ENTERE AT THE POSTOFFICI AT JACKSON AS
SECONCLASS MATTER

R WEBB  '   Editor and Manager
FRIAY Personal JUNE 12, 1903
ACTION EFERRE
At the special session of the
board of superisors held last Sat
urday the application of the Ameri
can Electric Company to erect pole
lines through Amador county was
Personal deferred until the July meeting We
do not know what led to this post
 ponement The company is prepar
I ing to put up a line through this and
I adjoining counties for the purpose
Zof supplying light and power It is
'in a measure a competing line
| There is no fault to be found with
the Standard Electric Company
That corporation has spent money
with a laish hand in adding to the
1 taxable wealth of the county, and
• the utilization of its resources It
; is desering; of all praise for what it
has already accomplished, and for
I what it is still doing It is by all
odds the heaiest taxpayer in the
county, and is therefore entitled to
, due consideration at the hands of
the authorities The postponement
of action was probably to enable the
superisors to inestigate the mat
ter more thoroughly If so, no' one
will question the wisdom of the moe
We cannot think for a moment that
the delay was prompted by any hos
tile feeling toward the new enter
prise Eery onward moement
awakens opposition from some
source It is bound to be so, because
Personal eery step in adance disturbs the
old order of things It causes a re
arrangement of business to conform
with new conditions It is only
natural that those whose interests
i are injuriously affected — temporarily
_ only it may" be— should not take
 kindly to the innoation We do
not beliee that any goerning body
will be swayed by such moties The
world is moing Old things are
passing away We canont stay the
onward march of progress een if
we wanted to We do not want to,
; howeer Rather let us encourage
' eery effort in this direction Een
the Standard Electric Company at
the inception of its ast schemes in
this county, was looked upon with
misgiings And yet no one need
to be told what an immense benefit
it has been to the deelopment of
our industries It is the proince
of goernment to gie all enter
prises a fair field and no faor
Eery enterprise adds to the tax
able wealth of the county, ; and
brings reenue to the public
treasury From this standpoint
alone the American company should
be encouraged 
AS USUAL
Eeferring to the recent robbery of
Neil Hamm's place in this city the
, Ledger, with its usual degree of
fairness, saysPersonal "Sheriff Norman and
eputy Jackson at once repaired to
the scene, and Young was soon
placed under arrest" Wouldn't
that jar?
The truth is that Constable Kelly
made the arrest, secured the con
fession and the coin before the sheriff
and his deputy arried
Isn't it in you to play fair? — Echo
We beg to remind our cotem
porary that the Ledger reports an
item of news in strict accordance
with the information which it re
ceies Perhaps the Echo man is
able to improe upon this policy
We leae the public to judge as to
that  Sometimes our information is
incomplete and inaccurate, but it
does not follow that the item is
written from ulterior moties To
insinuate, as our Athenian friend
does in the aboe extract, that
facts were deliberately suppressed,
only seres' to exhibit the jaundiced
character of the critic Fairness
is conspicuously absent apparently
i in his makeup
THE SCHOOL POPULATION
The returns from the school cen
sus marshals which we publish in
another column afford room for
grae concern If they are to be
taken as presenting the juenile
statistics in their true light, they
are positiely alarming The school
population is falling off year after
year, according to the official figures
This falling off, howeer, was neer
before brought out so alarmingly as
this year; We hae been accus
tomed to fluctuations of population
within the county, incident in a
great measure to the changing for
tune of the mineral industry But
from the standpoint of the county at
large we hae usually managed to
aerage up fairly well in the number
of school children This year the
statistics show a heay falling off all
along the line Not more than half
a dozen districts show an increase,
and in no case is the gain large On
the other hand, the loss in some dis
tricts is ery serious One of the
most populous districts in the county
has been cut down oneseenth of its
school strength Eery township
shows a diminishing youthful popu
lition For the whole county the
loss is about seen per cent Such a
rate of decline continued for 14 years
would wipe out our local school sys
tem This seems all the more sur
prising when we consider that the
year has been remarkable for the
number of borneseekers flocking
into California Instead of gaining
by the influx,' we hae been unable to
hold our own It is well to look the
situation squarely in the face If
our school population is declining,
the conclusion is ineitable that our
adult population is decreasing in the
same ratio Population represents
wealth If we are losing population,
the inference is that our taxable
property is suffering ii  alue also
In this connection we must mention
one fact that may to some extent
tone down the reported decrease of
children la accordance with a
change made in the law relating to
the school census, the marshals were
required this year to furnish a list
showing the name of, eery census
child This was not required "under
the old law; simply the number of
children in each household was re
ported, without giing the names
[t was much easier to fall into error
in reporting a larger number of
childre than were actually in the
district under the old than the
present law Indeed, where the
names hae to be gien, it is a hard
m»tter to stuff the roll to any ex
tent In the opinion of school super
intendent Gordon this change in the
law accounts largely for the decrease
reported Be beliees the decrease
is more apparent than real;' that
there are as many school children in
the county today as there hae
been in any preious year ;" "

eafness is caused by an inflamed con

and unless the inflammation can be

Frank Hoffman's Estate
The safe of the late Frank Hoffman
was opened last Friday, in the presence
of the heirs principally interested, and
attorneys and seeral citizens who had
been inited to be present ,The alue
of the personal property proed some
what of a disappointment There
was $4360 in gold coin Most of this
coin was rusted, indicating that It had
been burled for a considerable time,
and had but recently been rescued from
its depositary and placed in the safe
There was also oer $5000 in interest
bearing bonds, and certificates of stock
in the Argonaut and Bunker Hill mines
The total alue of the personal prop
erty will foot up to about $22,000 The
real estate consisting of seeral lots and
dwelling houses, was disposed of by tes
tamentary deeds, and the deeds placed
on record last week Miss Christina
Rickert was deeded the old homestead;
E Fisher receied the house and lot in
which he was liing, and to A Rickert
was deeded the corner dwelling at the
junction of the Sutter and Stony creek
road, which he and his wife hae oc
cupied for some time The estate is
disposed of by will, and the will has
been filed for probate An old will
made thirty years ago was discoered,
with the signature torn off, to indicate
its annulment The latest will it is
said, was made only a few weeks ago—
since the death of Mrs Hoffman
A peculiar feature of this affair is
that the deceased's body was the first
to find a restingplace in the costly
ault which he had ordered as the final
repositary of the remains of himself
and wife A few weeks back he made
a contrast with A Frauatoicb, the
local sculptor, for a ault and monu
ment to cost $1700 At the time of the
suicide the ault had been excaated,
and the floor and walls finished, and
temporary coering proided After
the funeral serices, the casket contain
ing tbe remains of Frank Hoffman was
deposited in this ault The same
eening tbe grae of Mrs Hoffman
was opened, and the casket containing
htir remains was remoed therefrom,
and ree?ent)y laid by the side of that
of her life companion

GOVER MINE ACCIENT
Superintendent Purington Killed by
Bursting of Air Compressor
A terrible accident occurred at the
Fremont Consolidated mine early Sat
urday morning, resulting in the instant
death of C E Purington, the superin
tendent, who has been in charge of the
works eer since the present company
was organized, and the injuring of
Wales Palmer, the foreman The acci
dent occurred at the air compressor,
close to the Goer shaft The air com
pressor was used to operate the power
drills underground It was run by
electric power It is a massie piecoof
machinery Eer since it was installed
it has been a source of more or less
trouble from the heating of the boxes
or bearings
On Saturday morning engineer Rule
noticed that the air compressor was
not working satisfactory He sent a
boy to notify Mr Puriigton of the fact
The superintendent, who was a practi
cal machinist, was on the scene In a few
minutes thereafter He started in to
try and fix the machine He had not
been there more than fie minutes
when tho explosion occurred
At the time of the explosion both
Purington and Palmer were close to
the machinery Palmer was engaged
In working at the machine, j but some
what out of line of the force of the ex
plosion Purington was standing in
front, adjusting the machine Sudden
ly the compressor burst, the cylinder
being blown into fragments One piece
caught Purington squarely in the
bpdy, and drpe him cfear tjirpugh the
side of the galanized iron ' building
The force was such as to almost cut
him in twp Of course, he was killed
instantly He probably had no time
to realise' what had happened
' The concussion was so great as to
throw Wales Palmer against the build
ing with" sufficient force to fracture two
ribs and disable one arm HU was
almost a miraculous escape from death
The news of this terrible disaster was
at once telephoned oer the county,
and produced a profound impression of
sp>rpw deceased #as 54 ye^rs pf age,
and leaes 'a wife and se£ era! childi'enPersonal
The body was taken to Auburn for
burial on Monday
For about 10 years the ictim, had
deoted his time and means toward
bringing tho Goer and Fremont mines
to their present condition In face of
discouragements that would hae dis
mayed the ordinary man, ' he worked
on He had the utmost confidence in
the mineral resources of this particular
section of the mother lode, and was
suthciently influential with capitalists
to induce them to inest in these claims
With the mill in process of erection
it was belieed that he was on the
erge of the realization of his fondest
hopes in bringing" the prop?rty to a
paying basla Eerything he had, he
had inested in the stock of the corpora
tion, thereby eincing his good faith
In the scheme which he preailed upon
others to inest in, he staked his all
himself He died at his post, when the
attainment of bis ambition was appar
ently in sight '" ' '
The air compressor that caused this
lamentable fatality, had ' gien con
siderable trouble eer since it was
started up about a year ago The de
ceased was himself a practical electric
ian and machinist i?he machine itself
and its settingiip was in a great meas
ure under his direction But it did
not work smoothly The boxes were
continually heating, causing appre
hension on the part of those employed
about the works Some time ago
mechanics from San Francisco were
employed to practically rebuild it Still
it kept up its record for kicking; ' J
Eudey was employed for a while there,
and quit on account of the premonitions
of disaster which the machinery gae
tortk,
THE CAUSE OF THE ISASTER
The precise cause of the explosion is
not ery clear The air compressor
was of the IngersollSergeant type It
was put up under the direction of Pur
ington himself The escape ale for
increasing or diminishing the pressure
was placed $ few inches abpe' the air
chamber, within easy reach pf the at
tendant This arrangement was a de
parture from the ordinary and stand
ard method Whether it had anything
to do with the fatal denouement we are
not prepared tg say James Rule, the
engineer, noticed a slight leakage
—a dripping— around one or two of the
bolts in the front part of the' com

right Puringtpn's son, a ypung man
of about 19, was attending the com
pressor The signs of distress were
sufficient to cause the engineer to send
a boy of Wales Palmer, who happened
to be near, to tell Purington In a few
minutes bpth Superintendent Puring
tpn and Fpreman Palmer appeared to
gether 'Tho former seeing the trouble
remarked, "We'll fix that" Rule
withdrew to the engine room, leaing
the two officials there Purington
reached for the ale oer the cylin
der Whether he shut off the escape,
thereby increasing the pressure, is not
positiely known Immediately the
front and top part of the air" cylinder
blew out; It was made of heay cast
Iron, fully an inch thick The impres
sion is that the manipulation pf the
ale increased the pressure, and the
explosipn resulted Fragments of iron
were hurled into the engine room The
concussion from the sudden release of
pentup air wrecked the 'side of the
building, breaking the studding, as
well as blowing off the iron sheets fas

Proposed High School istrict
lone is first in the field tp organize
for a uniph high sphppl dtgtript fpr the
purpose of recelying'tpe 'pepe'fit of the
law passed by the last legislature
authorizing a tax of j£ cents on all
taxable property in tbe'state for the
support of high schools An election
has been called in the school districts
in township two to ote on the proposi
tion The election will be held on Sat
urday, June 13 ' The districts to be in
cluded in the proposed high school dis T
trlqt are as fpllqwsPersonal CamV Qpra, Car
bondale,' lone', Mountain Springs,
Mt Pleasant, Mt Echo, and Lancha
Plana This arrangement omits Buena
Vista, Jackson Valley and Julian school
districts, from the scope of the high
school Outside of lone, the districts,
left put are tte jnosji" populous, fr&m
a juenile point of iew, in the town
ship, haing 98 census children while
the seen districts included in the elec
tion call outside of lone, hae a school
population of 128 It may appear
strange that the largest districts out
side of lone should keep alqpf from the
moement," especially when ' ]t ' is con
sidered that the territdry 'coered by
these districts is within easy reach of
the probable location of the school
We assume that in the three districts
excluded, a majority pf tho heads of
families declined tp jqin in the petition
to submit the question to a ote That
is the preliminary step in the formation
of a high school district A majority
of the heads of families — not a majority
of the qualified oters — in each school
district must sign a petition to, submit
fhe question tp a pte This is riot
pnly the initial step, but the most ital
step in the whole proceeding Con
sent to submit the high school question
to a ote, carries with it the consent of
each district to be goerned by the
majority ygte pf entire high, sphopl
fJistricf as pr£ppsed ' After agreeing
to call an electipn, the seeral c|Utr|cts
lose their indiiduality in the matter,
Thejr become merged in fl» e proposed
district as a whple Jn th,e coming
electipn a majority pte pf the qualified
electors is decisie of the question It
matters not whether Lancha Plana or
any other small district otes oer
whelmingly against the proositjon if
the ote on tlje whflle is T faorable,
Lanqha Plana its swept in with the rest
It is presumed of course, that in oting
to call an election those signing the
petition will also ote to establish the
high school Neertheless, it is proper
to explain the matter as far as possible
There is a possibility that the subject
may be misunderstood Wp hae not
noticed any discussion' of this partipular
point Itisnb mpre than r|ght that
those interested §hpuld' ; ho fully in
formed on a matter of such importance
as the subjection pf their property to a
special tax for an indefinite, period'
We do npt argue the justice or injus
tice of the law In this particular case
the preponderance of otes Is with lone
City Should lone ote solidly for,
and the outside districts, fita aqlidly
against >he pcopp|it(pn, 'still the
high school district  would' carry, not
pnly for lone but for all the other dis
tricts named True, tljat is an extreme
iew The prpbability is that a Majori
ty of the heads of families In all 'the
districts haing joined in the petition,
a majprity of oters In each district
will be found ranging themseles under
the banner of "for the high achqq}"
Such, hqweer, {a ty, ' and It is
right that those concerned stiquld lose

Animals Are Sensitie
 "The fact that a horse Is sensitie to
ridicule," said a student of the biolog
ical department of the Uniersity of
Pennsylania, "may easily be demon
strated Take, for instance, the case of
a horse that is eating out of a nosebag
If you stand In front of such a horse,
attract his attention, and then, with
loud , laughter, mock his way of feed
ing, he will stop, with a look of em
barrassment and shame, and he will
not resume his meal until y6u are gone
away
"ogs also object to being laughed
at Make fun of them and they will
cease whateer they are doing It is
only when they are in a fight that they
will remain imperious to the shafts
of mockery"— Philadelphia Post
The Hnman Body
' A pupil in a illage school who bad
been requested to write an essay on
the human body handed in the follow
ingPersonal "The human body consists of the
head, thorax, abdomen and legs The
head contains the brains, in case there
are any The ' thorax contains the
heart and lungs; also the lier and
lights The abdomen* contains the
bowels, of which there are fie— a, c, 1,
o,  and sometimes w and y The
legs extend from the abdomen to the
floor and hae hinges at the top and
middle to enable a fellow to sit when
standing or to stand when sitting"

" BRUTTSfCCTL'T TRAiNTNG
How Farmer Perldns Used Strategy
and a Ball Whip
There Is a right way and a wrong
way of breaking * colt to halter The
latter method is described by SewelJ
Ford in "Horses Nine" Blue Blazes,
the colt In the story, was owned by a
Michigan farmer He had been fright
ened by the first attempt to bridle him
and had broken away He was prompt
ly declared to be a icious colt
"We'll tame hlmr' said Farmer Per
kins Under his coat he bid a stout
halter and a heay bull whip Then,
holding a grain measure temptingly be
fore him, he climbed the pasture fence
 In the measure were oats, which he
rattled seductiely Also he called
mildly and persuasiely Blue Blazes
was suspicious Four times he allowed
the farmer to come almost within
reaching distance, only to turn and bolt
with a snort of alarm just at the cru
cial moment At last he concluded that
he must hae just one taste of those
oats 
"Come, coltle! Nice coltie!" cooe<J
the man in a strained but conciliating
oice
Blue Blazes planted himself for a
sudden whirl, stretched bis neck as far
as possible and worked his upper lip
Inquiringly The smell of the oats
lured him on Hardly had he touched
his nose to the grain before the meas
ure was dropped, and he found himself
roughly grabbed by the forelock In a
moment he saw the hated straps and
ropes Before he 'could break away
the halter was around his neck and
buckled firmly , Personal I T;
Farmer Perkins changed his tone
"Now, you ugly little brute, I'e got
you! [Jerk] Blast your wicked bide!
[Slash] You will, will you? [Yank]
I'll l'arn you!" [Slash]
Man and colt were almost exhausted
when the "lesson" was finished It
left Blue Blazes ridged with welts,
trembling," fright sickened Neer
again would he trust himself within
reach of those men; no, not if they of
fered him a whole bushel of oats
WOMEN'S HATS
Men, Sara a , Milliner, Are Kea
Judges of Becoming Effects
"on't think for a minute that men
know nothing about women's hats,"
said a milliner "I don't refer, to men
who can describe feminine friljs with
the fluency of a floorwalker I mean
the aerage specimen, who doesn't
know the difference between a toque
and a Gainsborough They are keen
Judges of effects— better than their
wies Men often come In fiere with
their wies' The woman begins to try
on all the hats In the shop The man
grows nerous While madam 'will
pirouette before the mirror and iew
the creation from eery side before
passing Judgment the man gies his
opinion without a bit of hesitation
" 'Take It off!' he will say" 'You look
like a Sioux brae with his war bon
net on!'
"He doesn't know why he disap
proes He couldn't describe the trim
ming if he tried, but he does know that
It doesn't suit his wife Without wait
ing a second he gies his decision;' and
his wife fe almost in tears as she sees
him turn down some of the prettiest
models But he doesn't care how they
look in the window or on the head of
Mrs Jones or Mrs Brown He wants
something that is becoming to his wife
"At last she tries on the hat he
wants He knows It een before she
has had a chance to glance at herself
in the mirror And I would say that
his Judgment usually coincides with
ours"— New York Press
riingPersonal ' Twele Horses
Here Is an arithmetical problem for
youPersonal If it is great fun to drie one
horse, how much fun is it to drie
twele horses? It is quite a natural
answer to say twele times as much
fun, but if you were to ask me I should
say diide ane by twele, and you will
hae a more correct answer Think of
It— twele horses to manage at once!
That is a sight I saw a few days ago,
howeer, in the crowded streets of
New York The drier showed such
superb horsemanship that people In
the streets stopped to admire his dex
terity The horses were drawing im
mense steel girders to be, used in erect
Ing a skyscraper Two men went ahead
of this caalcade to warn the cars to
stop at conenient places for passing
and to clear the street generally Es
pecially where a corner was  turned
was there much admiration expressed
for the drier's skill There he sat, as
calm and cool as if driing an old nag
down a country lane instead of twele
sturdy horses down New York's busi
