SICKROOM TACTICS
A Successful ' Nurs c; Must Be Gentle,
Patient and Tactful Personal
The proper mental atmosphere creat,
ed In a sickroom is often as important
as the remedies gien A nurse should
be in touch with her patient— that is,
she should be sympathetic and not al
low irritability and whims to upset her
equanimity The nurse who can create'
an atmosphere of repose,* who' can" hu
mor ' without ' indulging her patient \ In
all /the idiosyncrasies \ of^ sick ; people,
has won half the battle Personal An unsympa
thetic, Impatient nurse will do more to
hinder recoery than the lack of rem
edies It Is not acts and words alone
that help or hinder; her ery thoughts
are as potent as her "general conduct,
and the sensitie patient will be influ
enced for good or ill if the nurse were
dumb' She should at all times main
tain a positie uplifting mental atti
tude and remember that the patient's
Irritability or melancholia is justified
by • her physical  condition and \s  not
pererseness" 
Gentleness, patience and, ' aboe all,
tact are the requisites for good and in
telligent nursing,'!, and  the ' nurse who
lacks these qualities has Indeed missed
her calling Patients hae of ten failed
to improe simply because they did not
fancy their nurse A nurse must be
likable and make herself liked, and It
takes only plain tact and a little ch>
cumspection to ingratiate herself with
the most uninteresting of patients
THE GYPSIES
Their Tribes Existed In ' Burope
From Immemorial Times
Gypsies were found in England about
151, according to "A" yalogue of Sir
Thomas Personal More" (1529), but the exact
year of their arrial Is unknown They
were present 'ln Scotland in, 1505, and
possibly' they ' were the ! "Saracens"
whose • depredations ; In Personal that country
prior to 160 are on record
Batalllard and other authors beliee
that ; gypsies existed In ', Europe  from
Immemorial times, for they find no ac
count lof their Personal crossing  the i Bosporus,
and no record is known to exist of their
passage to England or Scotland" 
' They/ were better receied In these
countries than In ' any | other, \ but sso
early as  1531 an act was passed re
quiring ; the Egyptians 'to quit ' the
realm under  pain  of death, a similar
edict being issued in Scotland In 151
and at arying periods In most of the"
European states
Transportation across the ; seas ; was
among the milder means adopted and
probably J was the cause of much fur
ther dispersion of | the j tribes, i ;ndei'
Henry VIII gypsies were shipped from
England to Norway or  France, and
from France, so recently as 1802, they
were deported to Africa
UNTIMELY CHEERS
The Misplaced Bnthnitlasni ot an Ei>
Corpse In Ireland
, It was the rule In Ireland at one
time that after an execution t the body
should j hang j an hour, j but the " sheriff,'
froni mistaken lenity, j would ' on some
occasions look away after the prisoner
had been turned off, while  the friends
of the culprit would hold up their com
panion by the waistband of the trousers
so that the rope would not press upon
his throat •, > , ' _ X  
When t the JPersonal hour "was j expired the
deceased | was ; put I fnto a cart," which
was drien at a gallop along the stony
road ; The Jolting generally brought
the Personal prisoner  to One \ such jj recoery
was so" complete that the resuscitated
man sat up In the coffin and gae three
cheers, ;
( One of his friends was so shocked at
this Indecent conduct that he hit the
excorpse on the head with his shlllalah
and finished him The question then
arose whether the assailant could be
 tried for murder,' but it was ruled that
no man could be successfully charged
•with the murder of a man who was al
ready dead in law— Pearson's Weekly

A MOUSE THAT "SINGS"

 Singing mice ; are rare, , but a corre

Uft up their oices in this tuneful man

•r Three explanations hae  been Personal sng
gestedPersonal';  ; o ; '  , *Personal ;,, 
i ; First— That all mice are potential o
calists and can learn to sing, by imita
tion, from singiut? birds ,,' ''',  i
" 'Second— That many mice possess an
exceptional talent for mimicry, together
with a keen sense of the ludicrous' '',
| Third— That some mice are subject
to • bronchitis and that i the  so ( called
is only the wheezing of rodents
which suffer from the distressing com
plaint  ;, '

the last theory by the fact that a mouse

THE RAILROA PROJECT
Edward Records, the representa
tie of the American Rier Electric
Company, who is taking a leading
part in endeaoring to form a 'Com
pany to construct an electric rail
road from lone to Sutter Creek' and
Jackson, returned to this county last
week from a trip to San Francisco
with other promoters, and has been
interiewing the heay shippers of
supplies for the purpose of getting a
fieyear guarantee of all their
freight receied at the lone depot
for the proposed extension to the
mining belt • At first" blush this
may appear an entirely superfluous
proceeding PersonalIt is conceded that all
present methods of hauling freight
to Jackson and Sutter Creek must
gie way in the presence of a rail
road Neither freight teams nor
traction engines can compete either
in price or rapidity^of transporta
tion with railroad facilities Where
Jkenjs the need of asking for guar
antees? Another change in the pro
gram is that the money to construct
the j road is expected to all come
from the outside In other words,
bonds will be floated to pay the cost,
with some subscribed capital of
course to start the enterprise The
cost "of construction is now placed at
$150,000, which, whOe it is a big
raise on the original figures of $80,,
000," is 'probably still' a Very con
seratie estimate The aerage
cost per mile of railroad is oer $20,
000 An electric road is said to be
a cheaper proposition than a steam
road,'' and perhaps it can be bnilt for
something^ like $10,000 per mile!
The only reason we can see for the
demand for freight guarantees is to
satisfy intending subscribers for the
bonds With a \ certain amount of
business guaranteed, it can be easily
figured out what the freight receipts
would foot up, and hence a clear
idea can be'obtained as to whether
the road would be a a paying propo
sition — a proposition that would
commend itself to inestors suffici
ently'to induce them to take the
bonds From this standpoint the
effort^ to secure signed contracts
coering a number of years from the
principal mining companies along
tb'emdther lode seems a reasonable
moe The promoters guaran
tee to land freight at the mines of
Jackson and Sutter Creek at not' to
exceed $2 per ton This would be
about the maximum rate allowed for
railroad haulage, 15 cents per mile,
reckoning 1 miles road bed between
lone and Jackson This may seem
a steep tariff, still it is a great im
proement upon existing rates,
which are $ for general freight, and
from $3 to $350 for large quantities
As a rule, both companies and indi
iduals are reluctant to bind them
seles on such a proposition for , a
term of years, still it would be most
unfortunate for the project to fall
through for lack of promise of sup
portPersonal  It is a dead certainty that the
road will command the business on
the tariff rate proposed, whether the
guarantees are signed or not  But
if the contracts will help the scheme
along to a speedy realization, we ,do
hope the business will be pledged in
the manner required/ It will hurt
noorieV'it will help the interests of
the community at large amazingly
to sign the contracts
The Republican state committee'
adopted a resolution recommending '
that the state conention instruct
the delegates to the national coni
ention in faor of Rooseelt "as the
standard bearer in the coming cam
paign' '"While the committee in this
respect unquestionably oiced the
sentiment of the rank and file of the
party, not only in California, but
throughout the Union, still the wis
dom of establishing a precedent of
that kind may be questioned It is
not the proince of a state or county
central committee to  attempt ito
forestall the action of a conention
in regard to party nominees ijJWhat
would be thought of our county com
mittee recommending the nomina
tion of this or that  candidate We
would think it entirely out of place,
and a usurption ; of authority Po
litical committees are merely bodies
to set the party machinery in mo
tion They are not the whole thing,
indeed they are a ery Personal small part of
the real thing, notwithstanding they
wax dictatorial at times, and prance
around as if the party was made for
some of its members, instead of the
committee being the mere creature
of the party in conention assem
bled The Ledger beliees in keep
ing strictly within delegated author
ity The republicans of California
are practically solid for Rooseelt
It is improbable that any other name
will be mentioned in connection with
the presidential nomination And
whether W R Hearst or a straight
out democrat be his opponent, he"
will be swept into the presidential
office to succeed himself by one of
the largest majorities eer gien in
a national con tes
perhaps the mostpernicious,sys
tem introduced by^the unions is f the
practice of publishing a list of so;
called scabs— inenTwho "are deemed
traitors| to the cause ofl organized
labor because they "do notTsee their
way clear to do just what the labor
organizations want them to do
How the unions can defend this
practice, and at the same time de
nounce the keeping of a
by the employers, is something that
baffles oor comprehension We are
continually greeted with the appear
ance in print— a thing unknown in
history of employers in relation to
tabooed men— of a list of names
sometimes accompanied by the | por
traits of the  indiiduals under ' the
labor banPersonal— Occasionally  such 'pla
cards are posted, in"* conspicuous
places, being"> scattered
broadcast 1  through the! mails £ t,lf
such cond uct does _ not fall with i n
the scope of the libel law, it is about
time a law to that effect was passed'
Why such papers ; containing such
assaults upon priate character— a
palpable attempt !to abridge indi
idual liberty guaranteed by the con
stitution — are allowed the • priilege
of the liberal postal laws is incom
prehensible Eery man— and eery
organization of men— has the right
to the , free expression' of opinion
No reasonable man will dispute this
But when instead of a mere ex
pression of opinion an , indiidual's
right to earn a liing is directly as
sailed, and a man is held up to ridi
cule and ostracism, because, for
sooth, he wants to boss his own
labor according to his own con
science, it seems to us such tactics
are not of the kind to • carry weight
with enlightened American citizens
We cannot beliee that one tithe of
the members of labor 'organizations
approe ; of such , methods As a
rule, they are reasonable and intelli
gent men, and must sincerely de
plore this drift to extreme measures,
which cannot be otherwise than

MORE VERANT LEGISLATION
It was decided to petition the board
of superisors to pass an ordinance pro
hibiting any oneperson from haing in
his possession more than 100 trout at
any one time This is purposed to de
feat the malpractice of those who go
to the lakes in the mountains during
the summer months, catch seeral hun
dred trout and bring, them to loer
altitudes only to ' spoil before any use
can be  made thereof The ' petition
will be circulated immediately, and
presented to the superisors at the
next regular meeting It is a good
proposition and should be uniersally
endorsed —Record
The aboe is taken from the report
of the proceedings of the Sutter Creek
Game Protection Association at a meet
ing held last week, Let us hope the
superisors will fight shy  of cumber
ing the ordinance book with any more
fool laws along the lines proposed' We
hae a law now that prohibits the sell
ing of trout or game birds,, or the
catching or killing of  the same for
market Where the benefit of such an
ordinance comes in it is difficult to con
ceie It is eaded— and ery properly
and righteously eaded— by parties
catching fish for market, giing the
same away on reaching the market
towns, and accepting a donation of half
a dollar or a dollar, according to the
number of fish donated,  which  money
is to help defray the expenses of the
fishing expedition And why should
not an absurd law be bunkoed In this
fashion? Why should eery loer of
trout hae to take a tour to the lakes
or the creeks of the eastern part of the
county to gratify his appetite? Why
should he not hae the priilege of
paying others for the trouble and ex
pense of fishing, in lieu of taking a trip
to the hunting grounds himself? The
proposed law will hae no tendency
whateer to stop the spoiling of fish
It is far better to try to bring trout to
the towns, where they sell readily for
cash, than to leae them to rot in the
neighborhood where they are caught
Suppose such an ordinance is I passed,
what is to preent a trout catcher from
throwing away his catch before it
reaches the 100 mark, and starting in
afresh; We hae too many illdigested,
indefensible attempts at legislation of
this nature already J There neer has
been, and it is doubtful if there eer
will be, a coniction under them They
seem to be designed to stake around
the lakes and riulets of the upper sec
tion with impracticable ordinances for
the purpose of securing the fishing
grounds for the pleasure of the sport
ing aristocracy Our beautiful deer
law is designed along the same lines
It makes it unlawful to hae deer meat
in one's possession during that portion
of the year when climatic conditions
shut out the sporting fraternity from
the alley from hunting in the deer
haunts of the mountains The resi
dents of the mountains are not permit
ted, according to the letter of the law,
to kill deer in the open season, and
store the meat for winter use' Now it
is proposed to impart nhis same ridicu
lous inhuman phase to tame fish

Fell Two Thousand Feet
;An awful tragedy happened at the

death It appears he was being hauled
out ' of ; the shaft in the empty skip*
The skip, as usual, was hoisted "aboe
the collar of the shaft, and was being
lowered to enable the man to get off
At this moment something got wrong
with the machinery, the engineer being
unable to stop the skip It is a per
pendicular ' shaft, and skip and its
human freight went down like a flash,
all the efforts of the engineer to stop
Us downward career proed unaailing
It fell to the sump, a distance of 2000
feet  The cable unwound from the
reel, and went down the shaft with the
skip Of course, Leinsky 's life went
out before the downward  journey was
finished '• One would Imagine ' that he
was mangled beyond recognition ! But
this was not so, although scarcely , an
unbrokfo bono remained When found
his hands clasped the rope in a death
grip,, and the imprint of the cable
was left upon the flesh The Victim
was a young Personal man 21 years of age,

lized that the moement is needed, and
although some may be disposed to
cail, this only seres to make the true
friends of the church all the more de
termined to push the project to a
speedy consummation There is scarce
ly any doubt that the new M E church
will become an accomplished fact this
summer, and it is fully expected that
when the opening day comes, it will be
entirely free from debt
St Patrick Entertainment
The entertainment gien  in Loe's
hall last night, in behalf of St Patrick's
church, was a grand success in eery
way The annual celebration of the
day in Jackson for the benefit of the
church is inariably a success, but this
year the outcome was unusually grati
fying The night was stormy, and
many were kept away from this cause
Neertheless the hall • was packed to
the doors \ The resered seats, num
bering oer 200, were all taken The
drama presented was entitled "Because
I Loe You," in four acts All the
characters ' ' were sustained by local
amateurs They hae been practicing
for weeks, and their acting displayed
not only thorough preparation and
careful training, but histrionic ability
of no mean order It would be out of
place to particularize The characters
were taken as followsPersonal
Imogene Courtleigh— Wilful, wayward and
wealthy Mrs G L Thomas
Ginger— A gypsy waif  Mtss Loretta Meehan
Nance Tyson— Her supposed mother

Jackson tongues hae been agog the

office and addressed to a resident of the

a species of annoyance condemned by

Conditions Healthy
There are  fully 600 men employed
about the mines and mills of the" four
mines within a range of two miles of
Jackson— namely the ' Kennedy;"* Zeila,
Oneida and 'Argonaut  mines This ' is
the largest number of men employed in
mining operations in the history of this
camp during the era of quartz • mining
The money paid out monthly ' to ; sup
port this army of workers and supplies
must „* approximate \ from $76,000 to
$100,000 monthly Reckoning the pop
ulation of Jackson at 2500, thU \ would
make $30 per'month \ for eery man,
woman and child, or 81 per day,; per
capita from the mining industry alone
True, this Is the principal source of in
come,'but it is not  the only source
The salaries paid out for, county and
township officers and for other serices
will easily swell the per capita to from
10 to 20 cente additional This' money
is paid out as regularly  as clockwork
Few towns of the size of Jackson can
make such a'• showing It ought to
make the county Beat of Amador one of
the most thriing and ; prosperous
towns in the state Asa matter of
fact, it is a town of bustle and i thrift
It will 'compare with almost any town
of its size in the state No matter how
thrifty a} town may be, there "win
always go up from some quarters a cry
of hard times So it is here We hear
complaints that business is • dull that
money Is" scarce, and hard to collect;
that wageearners are not disposed to
spend as freely as in the past But
after all, It Is doubtless true that  more
money is being circulated In Jackson at
the present time, than at any  preious
period Business, houses hae increased
in number perhaps in a greater; ratio
than the wage earnersPersonal So that while
more business is done than heretofore,
the aerage percentage for "each busi
ness man  may  show  a ' decline ; This
may explain the complaint  from > some
old established  business places that
times are duller than , heretofore But
as a matter of fact Jackson is doing
fairly well,' all kickers to" the "contrary
notwithstanding ' And the outlook is
encouraging for, brighter • and lielier
times ahead '

Central Eureka Steadily Improing
as a iidend Payer— The Oneida
Personal Continues in a Prosperous Condition
, Central Eureka— This mtherJthe
most steady and liberal diidend payer
In the county at the present time,"'con
tinues to make a ery flattering show
Ing' The last diidend declared was
at  the ' fate of fie cents  per  share
Heretofore ";" the "diidends'; paid hae
been two cents  per shared" There are
00,000 shares in" the' company , W 6O* the
increased diidend aggregated Personal $20,000
The liberal "payment,* it is understood,
was not all earned during the preious
month, but the com imny wore in a
position to pay the increase by re
ducing the treasury surplus to
some extent It is reported that here
after diidends will be paid at the  rate
of 2} per cent; This 'shows the prop
erty to be in 'a ery prosperous con
dition' In I the ' last sinking; below the
2100 leel a fine ore body was encoun
tered'
Oneida— The full  sixty stamps of
the mill are now in steady operation
The mine Is looking better than at any
time since' it was' reopened by the pres
ent 'company While tho ore is not
high grade,  except 'Personal in  spots, ' taken
altogether the rock is of paying quali
ty, and leaes a fair margin of profit
The property is among the closest) and
most economically managed of < the big
mines of Amador county, and to this
fact is mainly due the present satis
factory outlook of the mine The his
tory of the Oneida, under its present,
as well , as its^ preious • owners, * Illus
trates the icessitudes of miningPersonal, oen
along the ' main gold' bearing lode of
Amador county  For a time the 60
stamp mill was kept in motion, at the
outset, without much attention being
paid to selecting the ore But it did
not "pay The poor rock; so' reduced
the  yield 'that  the pay; ore was in
sufficientPersonal to bring, the'; aerage to a
remuneratie basis  So twenty stamps
were kept; running, ' on selected ore,
with the" result that the,, improed out
put per ton was ery marked, and' the
property adanced to a selfsustaining
basis Rich spots in the ledge were en
countered, and the milling ore increased
in quantity until now the prospects are
bright for a ' steady _, career as ' a dii
dend payer' Only a~ strong company,
such as the one now in control, , would
hae been able financially to persist in
the face of discouragements that, for; a
time ; existedPersonal, ;The history fof! the
Oneida is  but a repetition  of the ' ex
perience of nearly eery big mine along
the lode ' Eery one has met with bar
ren and fruitful years But persistence
in * deelopment work ' has almost ,' in
ariably been rewarded with a liberal
yield of precious metal'
Gwin— The mill is operating with
90 stamps, the largest number that has
been in operation for a fongtime^l ! The
prospects hae much improed of late,
and the return of the era of diidends
is confidently Personal looked for in; the fnear
future !
Bunker Hill— The output of the
first month's  run "of the new', twenty
stamp mill which was started the mid
dle of February Is awaited with much
interest, not only by the stockholders
but also by the people generally, as the
launching of another steady producer
means much for the county at large
The ledge has been opened at three
leels— Boo/ 1200 and 100 feet Rock
from the 1 200 leel has supplied the
mill  This ore Is reported to be of
medium grade  compared with  the
other leels From the appearance of
the plates and the quantity of quick
siler fed millmen \ are i able to gie a
a fairly correct guess of the pay char
acter of the ore Judging from these
indications an aerage yield of $5 or S6
in free gold Is looked for The con
centrates saed are roughly estimated
at 1} tons per day, alued at $70 to $80
per ton These are claimed to be ery
conseratie figures, and sere to show

Jackson Creek Cuts a New Channel
We are Informed by residents of
Jackson alley that during the period
of high water, in the freshet of two
weeks ago, Jackson creek cut out a
new channel for itself, at a point about
a quarter of a mile before reaching the
new bridge constructed last season
near Buena Vista  The newmade
water way leaes the bridge nearly a
quarter of a mile from the main water
way newly  created Some water  is
flowing in the old creek bed under the
bridge, but most of the water ' pursues
the new channel The cause of this
shifting was not owing to any " faulty
construction of the approaches to the
bridge, but rather to the accumula
tion of sand and the growing willows
and shrubbery along the banks of the
stream The new creek makes a junc
tion with the old channel at a point
about a quarter of a mile below the
bridge To keep Jackson creek per
manently within Its old banks will in

Plum rwdlnar s Food
 In Personal Personal popular Personal belief » plum pudding,
though difficult of digestion, I contains
a large proportion of nutriment The
London Lancet publishes the analysis
made of^two puddings,Personal of which; one
was found to hae a "nutrient alue"
of 08 per cent and the other of 50
Personal It appears that, although most agree
able as an article of food, plum pud
ding is not Personal quite  so concentrated a
form of diet as has been supposed, and
conjectures that it yields as much sus
tenance as beefsteak are certainly, not

tion  The amount of nitrogenous mat
ter is only moderate, and it must be re
membered that In calculating! the nu
trient ratio and alue all 'the nitrogen
has been \ assumed Ito \be i'j albuminoid

eager to raise a brood of little emus,
but the birds showed no disposition to
propagate ; their J species Personal The duke
'finally grew weary of ' watching them
and left it to the keepers to bring him
immediate j word { of I any signs ' of a
