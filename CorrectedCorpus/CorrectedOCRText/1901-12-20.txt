THE BIRTH OF THE MOON
When -the -Earth Wai a Sphere of
Laa, Molten and Flattened
The earth reoles on its axis ouce
Ir 24 hours Millions of years ago the
dcy was 22 hours; millions of years be
fore It was 21 hours As we look back
ward into time we find the earth re
oling faster and faster Thoi was
a time, ages ago, long before geology
begins/when the earth was rotating in
a day of fie or six hours In length In
the remotest past the earth reoled In
a day of about fie hours It could re
ole no faster than this and remain a
single unbroken mass
It was at this time that the moon
was born— separated, broken off from
the parent mass of the earth The
earth was then a molten, flattened
sphere of laa Its whole body was
fluid The tides, which now are small,
superficial _ and, so to say, locals were
then uniersal and immense "" They oc
curred at short Interals Tbe whole
surface " of our globe"" was affected
And the corresponding lunar tides In
the fluid, molten moon were Indefinite
ly greater still
Our day Is now 24 hours; the distance
of the moon Is now 240,000 miles
When our day was about fie hours
long, the moon was In contact with the
earth's surface; It had just broken
away from Its parent mass As the
length of the terrestrial day Increased,
so did the distance of the moon The
two quantities are connected by In
exorable equations If one aries, so
must the other Wheneer the rotation
time of a planet Is shorter than the
period of reolution of Its satellite, the
effect of their mutual action Is to ac
celerate the motion of the satellite and
to force It to moe In a larger orbit
to Increase its distance, therefore
The day of the earth Is now shorter
than the month— the period of reolu
tion—of the moon The moon Is there
fore slowly receding from us, and It has
been receding for thousands of cen
turies But the day of the earth Is, as
we hae seen, slowly growing longer
The finger of the tides Is always press
ing upon' the rim of our huge* flywheel
and slowly but surely lessening tbe
speed of its rotation So long as the
terrestrial day Is shorter than the
lunar month, the moon will continue to
recede from us— Professor B S Hol
den In Harper's Magazine
A Curious Barometer
A curious barometer Is said to-be
used by the remnant of the Arancanlan
race which inhabits the southernmost
proince of Chile It consists of the
castoff shell of a crab The dead shell
Is white In fair, dry weather, but the
approach of a moist atmosphere Is indi
cated by the appearance of small red
spots As the moisture in - tbe air In
creases the shell becomes entirely red
and remains so throughout the rainy
season    
A Wise Prophet
"On the whole," said the aged weath

not come true" •

JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY DECEMBER 20 1901
The Ut» of a Coal Miner
 First the boy of eight or tenls sent
to the breaker to pick tbe slate and oth
er Impurities from the coal which has
been brought up from the mine From
there he , Is - promoted and  becomes a
door boy, working, ln the mine As he
grows older and stronger he Is ad
anced to the position and gien the
pay of a laborer There he gams , the
experience which secures him a place
as a miner's helper, and as he acquires
skill and strength he becomes, when ln
the height of his manhood and igor, a
full fledged miner
If he is fortunate enough to escape
the falls of rock and coal, he may re
tain this position as a miner for a num
ber of years But as age creeps on and
he Is  attacked by some of the many
diseases incident to work ln the mines
he makes way for those younger and
more igorous following i him up the
ladder whose summit he has reached
He then starts on the descent going
back to become a miner's helper, then
a mine - laborer, now a door' boy, and
when old and decrepit he finally re
turns to the breaker where he started
as a child, earning the same wages as
are receied by the little urchins who
work at his side There Is no incen
tie for ambition ln the aerage min
er's life He cannot rise to places of
eminence Personal and wealth > Only 1 In 500
can een be gien place as a foreman
or superintendent and these are posi
tions which few miners care to hold —

For His Reputation, $500
The proprietor of a large dry goods
store had decided to tear down the old
building and erect a new one in Its
stead In furtherance of this plan he
was remoing his goods to temporary
quarters in another building
The goods were nearly all out of the
old structure when from some un
known cause It caught fire  The de
partment was promptly on hand and
soon had a stream playing on the
flames, but the merchant was wild
with excitement  Running up to the
chief, he urged him to greater baste
"Neer mind the goodsf he shouted
"Sae the sliding! I'll gie tbe boys
a check for $500 for their pension fund
If they don't let the fire spread beyond
that floor!"
"Why, you're going to tear the old
building down anyway, aren't yon?",
asked the chief ~i--
"Yes," he said, "but do you suppose
I want the Insurance companies or any
body on earth to think that's the rea
son why It caught fire?"
By great exertion the fire was ex
tinguished with little loss so far as the
building was concerned, and the mer
chant was as good as bis word —

Queer Creatures
| There are microscopic creatures
which lie in roof gutters and on the
bark of trees and are known as water
bears and wheel animalculse If allow
ed to dry up under the microscope, they
canbe seen to shriel into shapeless
masses, which may be kept for years
uninjured in the dried state
On being placed after this long Inter
al In water they gradually plump up,
resume their proper shape and moe
about In search of food Just as If noth
ing bad happened Much the same is
true for the minute worms which from
tbe substances In which they lie are
known as paste and inegar eels Well
known Is the famous case of the desert
scail, which, retracted Into its shell,
was fastened to a tablet in the British
museum and showed no sign of life for
seen years, when one morning it was
found crawling hungrily about tbe
glass case that formed its prison
Dp His Sleee
At the battle of Omdurman a soldier
belonging to a Scotch regiment - was
nearly killed by a bullet which struck
the ground Just hi front of him while
he was firing ln a reclining position
On rising to moe a few feet forward,
something came down his sleee It
was the bullet How It got up bis
sleee wltbont Inflicting damage can
only be accounted for by the fact that
It must hae been spent by the time It
struck the ground In front of him and
the course of Its flight up his sleee
was Its last billet

I A simple way to restore color to wood
is to mix the color with oil and turpen

Change to Change a Quarter
"How much docs it take to change a
quarter?" asked the bartender "Twen
ty-fie cents, eh? Not on your life It
takes seenty cents to do the trick
How many ways do you suppose a
quarter dollar can be changed? Just
exactly eleen A fellow of limited
means may like the jingle of coin In
his clothes In that eent you can gie
him twenty-fie pennies or twenty pen
nies and one nickel He may like to
hae a little sprinkling of slier ln his
clothes, and you can accommodate him
with fifteen pennies and a dime or ten
pennies, a dime and a nickel
"If he prefers to hae change handy
for a beer and a car fare, why, fifteen
pennies and two nickels will fix him
up, and If he wants a cigar In addition,
besides haing a little stock of cash
In his jeans, gie him ten pennies and
three nickels That makes six ways
Now, then, a fellow with a quarter can
trade It off for fie pennies and two
dimes, fie pennies anfl four nickels,
two dimes and one nickel, one dime
and three nickels or fie nickels, just
as he prefers And to accommodate
htm ln any way that he might select
you hae to possess twenty-fie pen

Pound Foolishness
One of the commonest forms of pound
foolishness is countenanced by many
high authorities This is the purchase
of certain household proisions In large
quantities Few writers on domestic
topics fall to lay stress upon the econ
omy of buying groceries in bulk That
sugar, and flour," potatoes and apples
should be bought by the half or whole
barrel, cereals by the case, butter by
the tub and other things ln like propor
tion Is one of the early precepts In the
"Young Housekeeper's Complete Guide
to Domestic Economy"
Tbe ignorant  young things buy tbe
proisions first and the experience aft
erward, jj The flour grows  musty, the
cereals deelop weeils, the potatoes
and apples rot long before they can be
eaten, and the cook exercises a laish
ness ln the nse of the butter and sugar
she would neer show were they bought
In such limited amounts that the house
keeper could hold close watch oer
them Een after these eents the
young mistress feels as If she were ab

Loneliitess and Health
A medical journal has of late been
discoursing on the Indigestion of-lone
llness ; By this title Is meant to be In-,
dicated the disorders of digestion which
are belieed to follow the practice i of
taking one's meals In solitary, stnte
The topic Is by no means an (uninter
esting one Thousands of men and wo
men liing alone are compelled to take
their meals for the most part without
company Week In and week out they
feed themseles without a soill to talk
to, and the medical journal deotes Its
energies to showing that the practice
Is not one that Is likely to be conducie
to digestion, to proper bodily nourish
ment or to health The solitary man
soon tires of-merely eating, and, If he is
not of a literary turn of mind, his tend
ency Is to hurry through his meals to
escape from his loneliness into tbe so
ciety of his fellow men Herein, It is
held, lies a danger to health

Nordenskjold fonnd that the white
beans generally went through a long
performance of stalking his sailors,
clearly on the mistaken conclusion that
they were seals As the men were
clothed partly in sealskin, it was a ery
natural mistake But the Interest of
the story lies In the generalization
made by the bear The bear saidPersonal
J "There are two or three seals, one
standing up on its flippers in a ery
unusual way I will therefore stalk
them unseen as long as I can and
when they see me pretend to be doing
something else"
So the men, with their guns and
lances, who wanted to shoot the bear
had the pleasure of seeing him careful
ly crawling behind rocks and Ice hum
mocks, making long detours thlaway
and that and eery now and  then
clambering up a rock and peeping cau
tiously oer to see if the seals had
gone On the open snow the bear
would saunter off hi another direction
and then, falling  flat  push himself
along on his belly, with his great front
paws coering his black muzzle, the
only thing not matching the snow
about him Just as the bear thought
he had got his "seal" the latter fired
and shot him, a ictim of false analogy

Letter From Skagway
Skagway, Alaska, No 28 1901
Dear LedgerPersonal—
 Thanksgiing day again finds us
in the land of frozen blessedness Like
England, we are glorying in our
"splendid isolation" No mail from
the south now for six days The steam
ship Dirigo was due three days ago
with a supply of turkeys, but has not
yet arried The Canadian telegraph
line to "Vancouer has been down  for
seeral days; in fact, that has been its
normal condition eer since it was
opened in October, making- our connec
tion with the outside world ery spas
modic and uncertain The cable to
Juneau is a failure thus far, as the jag
ged rocks cut it to pieces faster than It
can be repaired 1 Between White Horse
and Dawson there is ice enough to keep
steamboats from running, and all traffic
is suspended \ until the ice is thick
enough to trael oer, then stages will
leae each end of the route eery day
Trains run regularly between here and
White Horse, but often with less than
half a dozen passengers Here in Skag
way are about 3000 people, all together
by their lonely seles, yet enjoying life
as well as those nearer ciilized centers
Three daily papers, one weekly, and one
monthly, show that we are not exactly
illiterate, nor altogether saintly Fie
churches are well attended, and the
Salation Army is much in eidence,
at least once in 24 hours Two hun
dred and six children keep fie teachers
busy in the new $9000 school house
The police court and jail are not lonely
places by any means, and eleen
lawyers wear good clothes ' and smoke
two bit cigars The Light & Power
Co is putting in a new $40,000 electric
plant, and improements are being
made in many places  The frequent
blasts heard from the prospect tunnels
on either side of town, tell where the
ledges are being tested,' and if, as many
beliee, these mountains are worth
working, Skagway has a great future
These ledges lie like those of the
Tread well lode, and would require no
hoists or pumps We hae had no
seerely cold weather yet,' and ery
little snow— a marked contrast to Last
year The aerage temperature lately
is 20 degrees aboe, just keen and brac
ing  Windows generally hae a dainty
tracing of frostwork, under foot the
snow creaks at eery step, gloes 'and
mittens are ery comfortable, and • un
coered ears soon tingle From the
mountain side east of town comes a
mighty racket, caused by the wood
that is being constantly sent down the
numerous chutes or slides, from where
it grew, to the leel plain on which the
town stands Some of these chutes are
half a mile long, and a cheap, quick
moans of transportation Wood sells
for $6 and $7 a cord; coal is $13 a ton
To-day union serices are held in the
Baptist church, egg-nog and hot lunch
es in the saloons, and the "A B S"
gie a "Grand Ball" in their hall to
night The Arctic Brotherhood is a
society started in Skagway about three
years ago, and now has lodges all oer
the northern country The chief ex
citement lately, is the supposed un
earthing, by the Northwest Mounted
Police, of an organization called the
Order of the Midnight Sun; the object
of which was to oerthrow the Canadi
an goernment, and ask protection  of
the United States Whether this be
lief had any foundation or not, it is
certainly a strange state of affairs,
when Uncle Sam pays so much atten
tion to aliens across the ocean, and al
lows American citizens to be drien
out of American territory, and a region,
rich as that for which England is
fighting in South Africa, gien up
without a protest
The sun is in sight here now less than
two hours each day, and yet we would
all be happy if the Dirigo had arried
with those turkeys An inquiry made
by kind-hearted people regarding the
destitute in town, resulted In the com
forting assurance that no one was
without means to buy turkey If the
birds could be found Another in
stance of Turkey's shortcomings
Yours in disappointment,

arried, with three tons of turkeys

FRIDAY DECEMBER 20, 1901
CHRISTMAS
-
Christmas is the one holiday that
stands out from' all other festie
seasons It is the festial not of
one nation, but of all Christendom
It is commemoratie of the birth of
the Christian era, by the adent of
the babe of Bethlehem It is the
only birthday that has withstood
the shock of ages, and is in fact
more widely celebrated as the cen
turies roll by And yet the exact
day and een year of the birth of
Christ is a matter of conjecture
These points hae become dim with
the lapse of ages It was not until
the fourth century that the 25th of
December was fixed upon by the
ecclesiastical authority as - the date
of his birth One of the main, argu
ments that-led to this decision was
the meteorological conditions and the
customs of sheepherders in the land
of Palestine Neither ecclesiastical
nor ciil records hae been handed
down from cotemporaneous times
affecting this interesting question,
except the four biographical sketch
es known as the gospels, written by
the fishermen of Galilee Strange
that these unlettered men, who in
picturing a perfect human character
accomplished a task that baffled all
the wisdom of the ancients, should
leae this matter in obscurity
Christmas was at first obsered as
an exclusiely sacred festial, and in
its celebration was gradually intro
duced gorgeous display and attract
ie ceremonies Latterly it has par
taken of a social as well as a re
ligious character, and children es
pecially are accustomed to look for
ward to it as the season of gift and
merry making It is emphatically
the period of glad tidings today, as
it was to the shepherds of old, and
recognized as such the world oer
How or when the custom originated
of exchanging the familiar compli
ment of this particular season we
know not Its appropriateness,
howeer, as expressie of the good
feeling and well wishes of one toward
another is beyond dispute And in
accordance with this old-time cus
tom the Ledger extends its greeting
to its readers, and sincerely wishes
them a merry Christmas and happy
new year
THAT CARBONDALE BRIDGE
From parties liing in the icinity
of the so-called emergency bridge
Dear Carbondale,  we learned that
up to the middle of last week nothing
had been done toward the construc
tion of the bridge at that point;
so far as material, on the ground
was concerned It is now two
months since the contract was
awarded without competition, on
the ground that it was a case of
great emergency that would not
permit of delay in calling for bids in
the usual way We said at the time
" that in all probability the public
would hae obtained a bridge quicker
• and cheaper if the superisors had
proceeded in the ordinary way, and
time has proen the correctness of
that statement It is -now rumored
that the price, $1200, is far beyond
what the structure would hae cost
had competitie bids been called for
What has caused the delay in the
erection of this bridge we are not
prepared to say The hollo wness of
the "great emerge ncy" cry has been
demonstrated by the course of eents
We do not doubt the sincerity of
the superisors on this question'
They acted as they thought for the
»' best interests of the community,
j although with undue haste! ' Some
body has been deceied It would
be a salutary lesson if some citizen
would protest the payment of the
bill for this bridge, if it is construct
ed at all under the emergency con
tract
Rumor is rife in Jackson this week
that another fly has been caught in
a webb — Dispatch
Rumors of a definite character
hae been in circulation in this burg
for years that diers persons hae
been afflicted with rust The Ledger,
unlike its green-eyed cotemporary,
has neer heretofore considered
either the subject or the object of
sufficient importance to its readers
to demand een local, much less
editorial mention

THE MODOC LYNCHING
The Modoc county lynchers are now
on trial, and it is dollars to doughnuts
that there will be no coniction There
is reason for this The citizens of that
county had been annoyed for the past
few years by haying their stock stolen,
shot and mutilated, and, after haing
inoked the aid of the law on seeral
occasions without securing a coniction,
took the law in their own bands and
did a little wholesale^hanging Mob
law is to be deprecated on all occasions,
but the fact still remains that when
justice fails to be meted out to the
wropgdoers ; citizens step in and ad
minister it in a crude but sometimes
satisfactory way — Dispatch *
A more despicable expression of
sentiment than the aboe can hard
ly be imagined In addition to being
in execrable taste, it lacks both con
sistency and courage Like the
notorious district attorney of Modoc
county, it tries to straddle both
sides of a clean-cut issue It pro
fesses to condemn mob law, and in
the same breath pats the lynchers
on the back for haing performed a
satisfactory job It coneys the idea
that society in California is only
half organized, and mob latf is a
necessary eil occasionally to keep
the lawless element within bounds
We emphatically dissent from this
infamous declarat ion It is a libel
upon the state, and we but oice the
oerwhelming sentiment of Amador
county in repudiating such utter
ances We hae heard democratic
encouragement of lawlessness before,
but neer such a ile backing of a
illainous crime as this The Modoc
lynching — inexcusable from eery
standpoint — takes preeminent rank
among the exploits of murderous
mobs in this state If the lynchers
emerge unscathed from the clutches
of the law, as our cotemporary so
flippantly predicts, all we can say
is, it will be a setback to the prog
ress of Modoc county only second to
the lynching itself While the state
of California and the county of Mo
doc are each pouring out treasure
without stint in a legal struggle to
bring the band of lynchers to justice,
and thereby wipe out as far as pos
sible the blot of their foul deeds,
it is deplorable to find a journal so
forgetful or defiant of its duty of
loyalty to law and order as to co
ertly applaud these miscreants who
judge not by law and try not by
jury, and gleefully anticipate a mis
carriage of justice as administered
by the courts
OOR cotemporary intimates that
the incorporation issue will be tried
again in Jackson at the general
election next year, and that those in
faor thereof will be oerwhelmingly
in the ascendant "Distance lend
enchantment to his iews" He
fails to state on what he bases his
prophetic utterance What has
brought ' about such a wonderful
change in the oters Why will it
carry next year, when it failed to
carry this year? And why submit
the issueat ageneral election? What
benefit in the way of economy or
any other respect can result from
such a course? If it were legal, it
certainly is inexpedient, if not im
practicable, and would effect no sa
ing whateer in expense Further
more, candidates for local offices
would not care to inject that issue
into the local canass The demo
cratic sheet is talking wildly We
beliee we will be much safer in
predicting that the incorporation
issue will not be mixed up with the
next general election

"recently Fullen left $100 with Ryan

I pay taxes, Fullen drew his money and
came to town on that business Ar
riing here he got twenty dollars from
a friend, and paid his taxes therewith,
receiing fie siler dollars in change,
which were wrapped up by themseles,
and leaing his $100 in gold intact
On returing he again deposited, as he
 thought, the $100 with Ryan, remark
ing that he had not used any of it
Without opening it Ryan placed the
package in his safe ' Some days there
after|Fullen, haing use for some money
called upon his banker, and was handed
his package of coin just as it had been
receied On opening it, instead of
fie double-eagles, it was found to con
tain fie siler dollars Blank astonish
ment was pictured in the countenance
of each at this startling discoery
Ryan naturally was roused to action
by the turn of affairs, and set to work
to unrael the mystery Coming to
 Jackson he found the $100 package was
• being safely kept for its owner by W
• Going, the court houso janitor It
, seems that Fullen, after paying his
f» taxes, picked up the siler package,

There is no question that his distress
is sincere, and not assumed for effect
On receiing his sentence of seen
years, he broke into a flood of tears

of seen years is thought >by some to
be a little seere when contrasted with
the sentence of two years meted out to

from the Press Publishing Association
of Detroit in relation to the total ote
for goernor, cast in the recent elec

NEWS FROM THE MINES
Work Being Done at the
Del Monte
Outlook Encouraging at the South
Eureka— Fie Stamps Dropping
at the Amador-Phoenix
Slaughterhouse— Work on this
quartz mine, near Oleta, has been sus
pended for a while, for what reason we
are unable to say According to all ac
counts the rock prospected well,"" gi
ing an aerage assay alue of $10 per
ton The ledge is from" 18 inches to
two feet wide, and the depth attained
is less than 100 feet Operations will
no doubt be resumed ere long
South Eureka— Superintendent
Parks informs us that the outlook for
this mine is more encouraging than at
any time in its history Assessments
hae been discontinued for about a
year, and an indebtedness of $10,000
has been paid off by the net proceeds
of the mine The mine is opened up
to the depth of 2000 feet, and large ore
bodies exist in all leels The rock,
howeer, is mostly low grade — too low
to admit of milling alone Exploration
has been pushed with a iew of disco
ering some ore of higher grade, which,
mixed with the low grade, would leae
a margin of profit This hope is likely
to be realized, and as soon as the pros
pect justifies, the company will con
sider the question of proiding a larger
and up-to-date mill
Kennedy — This big property moes
along in its accustomed gait, with the
prospect of at least doubling its milling
capacity next spring The manage
ment is debating the question whether
to erect a 40 or 60 stamp mill at the
east shaft It is also contemplated to
put in power drills The Gwin and
Oneida hae found this method of
drilling considerably more economical
than hand labor With the addition
to the mill the mine will gie employ
ment to from 50 to 75 more men at
least
Amador-Phoenix— Fie stamps of
tho mill were started Monday morning,
running on rock from the dump The
appearance of the plates, we are told,
indicate a paying alue, and fully up
to expectations, considering the mixed
character of the ore that is being
worked
Peerless— This mine has been dis
mantled, the machinery taken out of
the shaft, and work abandoned We
are informed that it is the intention to
prospect the property at another point
Del Monte— The monthly report
says that during the month of Noem
ber work was adanced upon the new
crosscut tunnel a distance of 75 feet;
east drift on old tunnel leal adanced
about thirty feet, at which distance
the ledge reappeared upon the face of
the drift, and rapidly widened out to
three feet of ledge matter, including
quartz, filling and gouge, all well min
eralized and showing good alues upon
prospecting Eery indication leads
the management to beliee that the
ledge is approaching its intersection
with another ein traceable by surface
croppings, which intersection will un
doubtedly deelop an excellent body of
good milling ore The appearance of
the ledge is so gratifying that it has
been decided to prosecute work dili
gently upon the east drift, drie a
raise, and crosscut the foot wall to
prospect the country beyond The
superintendent reports tho appearance
of the ledge now to bo better than any
thing yet encountered east of the shaft
It was also decided at the meeting of
the board of directors held Dec 6, that
negotiations be made for the immedi
ate purchase of a compressor and drills
for the work on the crosscut tunnel;
that a contract be let for cutting 100
cords of wood for milling purposes, and
arrangements made for increasing the
force of men on January Ist The
secretary, who is still at work in the
east, reports oer 5000 shares sold since
No 1, with excellent prospects' of In
creasing this amount by 10,000 before
spring, which will enable the directors
to remoe the stock from the market
Terrible Accident
A shocking accident happened last
Saturday morning, through the care
less handling of firearms The ictim
is a young man, named ' Frank Molo
ich, an Austrian, 25 years of age He
was out hunting on the lone road In
passing through a fence or gate, about
a mile from MarteU's station, in pulling
his gun toward him the weapon was in
some unaccountable manner discharg
ed  It was loaded with small shot,
and the charge passed through his
right hand Leaing his gun on the
ground, he made all possible haste to
MarteU's, and sent for Dr Gall, who
attended to the injured man promptly
The hand is badly shattered, but the
doctor hopes to be able to sae the two
small fingers and the thumb; the other
two fingers hae been amputated
The ictim is a member of the Austrian
Beneolent Society, and will be taken
care of by that order

The Proposed New Boad
A proposition has been before the
superisors for seeral months, on peti
tion of L P Haney and others, for a
new county road from a point on
Myers ranch on Stony creek, to con
nect with the Buena Vista road In
all, a total of fie miles was to be added
to the highways under public control
Considerable interest was manifest on
both sides of the controersy C\C
Prouty, a prominent farmer and land
owner of Jackson alley, was actie in
urging the creation of tho new { road;
U F Elledge, also a largo stock-raiser
of the alley, oer whose land the pro
posed new road would pass, was equally
earnest in opposition At the hearing
of the case, it deeloped that the road
as sureyed would cross Jackson creek
six times in its fie mile run, inoling
the maintenance of a double line of
fence at each crossing The serious
objection was pointed out by super
isor Amick, who said that he could
not in justice to himself and his con
stituents, ote for the measure under
such circumstances I It was admitted
by those who were earnestly adocat
ing the new road, that this was a seri
ous objection On this showing the re
port of the iewers, recommending
this line of road, was rejected There
after upon being questioned by the
superisors, the petitioners declined to
gie a bond in the sum of $2500 to guar
antee the expenses, upon which state
ment the superisors -by a unanimous
ote threw out the petition

Constable Gray yesterday brought
oer a prisoner from Sutter Creek,
named Antone Cabona, to sere a term
of 100 days in tho county jail for steal
ing ore from the Central Eureka mine
His coniction was brought about in a
singular manner Cabona is a married
man, and was employed as a miner at
the Contral Eureka His matrimonial
life was not without its disagreements,
and occasionally their quarrels waxed
fast and furious On Sunday last one
of their iolent disputes occurred, the
outcome being that^ the wife left the
house, and Cabona put in his time in
the afternoon in treating somo gold
oer the kitchen stoe The woman
got back to her home that eening, but
the following day another tempest
swept the matrimonial sea This time
the wife deemed the conduct of her
spouse merited retaliation on her part,
so she hied away to the constable and
informed him that her husband had in
dulged in some mining on his own ac
count to the detriment of the Central
Eureka Company She told the of
ficer where some rich rock had been
concealed in the cellar The superin
tendent was promptly notified, and a
search warrant was secured The con
stable started prospecting operations
in the cellar of Cabona's home, and
after sinking two feet came upon a lot
of specimen rock, alued at $50 Ca
bona was cornered and pleaded guilty
to a charge of petty larceny, and is
paying for his pranks in attempting a
short cut to wealth by a stay of 100
days at the county boarding house

A Profitable Crop
The ineyardists of "Amador county
hae enjoyed a fair measure of pros
perity for seeral years past, the price
of grapes haing enabled them to rea
lize fair profits A few years back
grapes were a drug in the market, and
the prices ruling loft nothing for the
growers Of late years they hae
proen one of the most profitable of
crops For seeral years there has
been no trouble in getting $20 per ton
for wine grapes A ineyard properly
kept, with ines in full ' bearing,- will

Two Circus Feats
"A great deal of unnecessary sym
pathy is wasted upon the circus man
who stands up - proudly ' in spangled
tights and lets another circus man
bring down a slwlge "hninnier upon a
rock placed upon his head with force
enough to break It," says an old circus
man "This Is spectacular, but Is en
tirely; painless and calls for no gerat
strength or end iirance" ; Upon the cra
nium of the strong man is put an Iron
contriance weighing about 150 pounds
and proided with cushions both aboe
and where it rests upon the head A
pretty good sized rock Is used, and the
hammer is a heay one, so you can see
that the blow that cracks the rock Is
really a serious one But most of the
force is taken up by the rock and the
rest by the Iron and cushions, while
the only sensation felt by the subject
is a gentle tap
"No more difficult than this is the
act whereby the hero of the canas
tent permits a rock to be broken upon
•his chest with a blow from a sledge
hammer So long as the subject's back
is free and does not rest against any
solid object the trick Is perfectly sim
ple A little illustrationPersonal Take a board
up and let it lie freely In your band
and hit it smartly with a hammer It
is difficult to hurt your hand, and the
thicker the board the less the sensa
tion But now put your band on the
table and hit the board Hurts, doesn't
it? Well, It's the same with the rock
on the chest" -
How Our Ancestors Quarreled
A study 'of mediaeal rural life is apt
to gie the Impression that the princi
pal part of the life of the people was
spent In quarreling or in the commis
sion or prosecution of offenses Our
ancestors certainly were a ery liti
gious and a ery disorderly people
The records teem with Instances of men
and women drawing knies against one
another, of breaking Into bouses, of
prosecuting one another for slander
Then we hae such entries as thesePersonal
"It is ordained by common consent
that all the women of the illage must
refrain their tongues from all slander
ing" "Thomas, son of Robert Smith,
is fined 12 pence because bis wife Ag
nes beat Emma, the wife of Robert
the tailor, and Robert, the tailor, six
pence because his wife Emma swore at
Agnes, the wife of Thomas" "It is en
joined upon all the tenants of the il
lage that none of them attack any oth
ers in word or deed, with clubs or ar
rows or knies under penalty of paying
40 shillings",
Such entries, frequently occurring In
addition to the Innumerable instances
of Indiidual attack, slander, petty,
theft and other Immorality seem to
show a community of far from perfect
irtue— Lipplncott's
Italians Loe Tomatoes
Italians more than any other people
alue tomatoes, and each one that
comes to perfection is as carefully tend
ed as though it were an apple of gold
Not only do the housewies delight In
the fresh egetables themseles, but,
generally sponUlng those home tended
are better than any purchased at the
market, and so each one is jealously
saed to make totnatoe sauce for the
spaghetti, without which no Italian
Sunday would be Sunday One soapbox
gardener one season sold enough toma
toes to gie Ikt quite a little pin uiouey
No oue who knows the Italian well will
be surprised to learn thai inauy of the
luixes are deoted to peppers, for they
In truth furnish much of their spice of
life, and een the little Italian girls
kuow how to stuff and cook them In a
dozen different ways that tempt the
palate— Boston Transcript

A NOVEL HOTEL BILL
The Mail to Whom It Was Presented
Could Not linderstand It
"Talking about bookkeeping, there
used to be a man In Yankton whose
system of bookkeeping accounts was
wonderfully efficient He kept a hotel,
and 1;p could neither read oor r wrlte
He dki uoi LiPersonalow how to spell his own
name, but he did a thriing business
and collected eery dollar of his ac
counts Once, years ago, when I first
came to this country, I went to his ho
tel and stopped there two weeks,"
writes Milt Brinben
"When I left, he presented me with a
statement of what I owed him, and it
was a curiosity He had copied it from
his ledger At the top of the sheet
there was a rude picture of a soldier
on the march and after it three straight
marks Then there was a scene show
ing a man at table  eating Then ap

amount column there was a picture of
a doll and 'after it the two letters "ES"
After the picture of a man eating there
were forty-two marks; after the iew
of the man in the bed, fourteen marks
I looked (if the account, then at the
proprietor, ;! \A& him It would take
me a week to answer that conundrum
"I was completely stumped, and when
that hotel man deciphered the amount
for me It was thisPersonal The picture of the
soldier walking meant march, and the
three marks supplied the date, March
3, when I began boarding The man
at the table with forty-two marks after
it indicated that I had eaten forty-two
meals The man in bed with fourteen
marks showed that I had slept in the
house  fourteen nights The doll with
the 'RS' after it meant 'dollars,' and
in the figure columns appeared the fig

A Persian Barber
A "Persian barber works In a style
ery different from that in ^>gue In
this country A typical shop Is a
square room, with one side open to the
street I the center is a tiny bed of
flowers sunk in the floor, from the
middle of which rises an octagonal
stoe column about three feet high
The capital of the column forms , a
receptacle for the water in which the
barber dips his hand as he shaes his
customer's scalp In Persia they do
not lather The shop is ery clean In
two recesses stand four ases filled
with flowers and the implements of the
barber's art— scissors, razors, lancets,
hand mirrors, large pinchers to extract
teeth, branding irons to cauterize the
arteries in amputating limbs, strong
combs, but not a hairbrush," for that
implement is neer used by Persians |
From the ] barber's girdle hang a
round copper water bottle, his strop,
and a pouch to hold his instruments
In his bosom is  a small mirror, the
presentation of which to his customers
is a sign that the Job is finished and
that the barber waits for his pay The
barber shaes the heads of his custom
ers, dyes their beards, pulls their teeth,
blisters and bleeds them when ailing,
sets their broken bones and shampoos

Strange Lapse of Memory,
Cases of forgetfulness on matters of
interest are on record While Dr
Priestley was preparing his work en
titled "Harmony of the Gospels" he
had taken great pains to inform him
self on a subject which had been under
discussion relatie to the Jewish Pass
oer He wrote out the result of his
researches and laid the paper away
His attention and  time being taken
with something else, some little time
elapsed before the subject occurred to
his mind again Then the same time
and pains were gien to the Personal subject
that had been gien to it before, and
the results were again put on paper
and laid aside So completely had he
forgotten that he had copied the same
paragraphs and reflections before that
It was only when he had found the
papers on which he had transcribed
them that It was recalled to his recol
lection This same author had fre
quently read his own published writ
ings and did not recognize them

A LIVING BAROMETER
The Crabllke Spider That Poses aa
Vncatnn's Weather Sharp
 In Yucatan, a land of many curiosi
ties, there Is a liing barometer in the
form of a small spider, called "am" on
account of the effect produced by Its
poi=on As far as Its own conduct goes,'
the insect is inoffensie and can be
handled with impunity, but if anybody
has the misfortune to get one mysteri
ously mixed with his food he is certain
to rile after a few hours and meanwhile
for some "unexplained reason will fre
quently ejaculate "Am, am, am!" hence
the name of the spider Throughout
the peninsula this Is affirmed to be a
fact, and if an am falls Into fodder of
horses or mules the animal that swal
lows it surely dies Personal  Personal,
 This spider is shaped , like a crab,
minus the claws, and is of a bright yel
low color, with brown spots; the big
gest could be accommodated upon a
siler dime Its faorite abode Personalis
among the leaes of the banana shrub,
commonly, but erroneously, called tree
There It spins with extreme rapidity,
its web, which Is prodigiously large,
considering  the size of Its architect,
and proceeds to deour the flies that
are unlucky enough to get  entangled
in the meshes of this astonishing little
glutton, that Is not satisfied with less
than a dozen a day— that is to say, it
consumes, a good deal ; more, than its
own bulk Its progeny is -numerous
and appears at first like more black
specks, smaller than the smallest pin's
head
The sky may be blue and cloudless
when suddenly the am commences tak
ing in its sails, or, rather, gathering in
Its net, with neatness and dispatch,
cramming the whole of the material
Into its diminutie body entirely out of
sight A few minutes completes the
Job, and the spider takes np Its posi
tion on the under surface of one of the
great leaes to be lulled by the gentle
swaying and sheltered while the storm
rages It Is for this that the am has
prepared, and neer is It mistaken
When the web Is taken In, rain will
certainly fall within an hour
The moment the am is touched It
feigns death and lets Itself drop, show
ing no sign of lffe until again placed
upon a leaf or on the ground Many a
one has lain In the palm of the writer's
hand Inert, ail its legs drawn close to
its body, while it was examined at
leisure, een being picked up in the
fingers ' without its manifesting any

A good circulation Is essential to the
growth of the hair as well as to Its col

brushing with a stiff brush is the best
method of obtaining this
A writer upon the complexion says
the best way to treat freckles, a sure

A Geological Fallacy
Probably the most wild and unjusti
fiable of all the crude beliefs respect-
Ing geological resources is that which
holds to the coniction that by going
deep enough the drill Is sure to find
something of alue, no matter at what
point the work of boring is commenced
I \ There are numerous wise persons In
eery community, estimable, Influen
tial and in the highest degree public
spirited who are coninced that the
question, for example, of finding coal
In their special locality is simply a
matter of the depth to which the ex
plorations are carried Rock oil and
natural gas are recognized as desirable
products In eery progressie commu
nity, and eery such community con
tains persons in other respects intelli
gent who are ready to stake their own
fortune and that of their nearest
friends on the belief that oil and gad
are eerywhere underneath the surface
and that their sources can be tapped
with the drill proided only there Is
sufficient capital to keep np the process
of drilling long enough— Mines and
Minerals
Professional Shoppers
Professional shoppers are employed
by a certain large 'firm of London
drapers to test the abilities of shop as
sistants This firm owns oer thirty
large shops and employs nearly 1,000
assistants To find out whether eery
customer Is politely sered a number
of lady customers are employed to call
at the arious shops They are told to
gie as much trouble as possible and
sometimes to leae without making a
purchase after looking at nearly eery
thing In the shop Should the unfortu
nate assistant's temper not be equal
to the strain, or should a single word
be said that might offend, a report will
Infallibly reach headquarters and lead
to the dismissal of the sorely tried
handler of silks and ribbons, i

Did the Immortal George Wear Ar
' ttacial or Natural OnesT
"George Wasblagtoji's false teeth,
which were supposed to hae been
made of Iory, aie giing a certain
class of freak historians about as much
trouble as they must hae gien the
enerable patriot who wore them,"
said one of the professors Personal of  the
Smithsonian institution to a reporter
recently •
"Many times a year for seeral years
this Institution has been called upon to
produce these mysterious teeth for the
inspection of persons who insist that
they are here |
"Our matter of fact answer to these
inquiries that Washington bad no false
teeth, or at least if he did, that they
are not In the possession of the mu
seum, seems only to stimulate the in
quiring mind to protest our statement
They proceed to gie us authentic ac
counts of these teeth and always con
clude with expressing the belief that
they must be in the museum some
where 
"Where or how the idea that Wash
ington had false teeth originated is an
unsoled mystery That it Is firmly be
lieed by many is certainly a fact
There seems to be no authentic record
of the Father of His Country possess
ing iory teeth, and by a study of the
bust we hae of him, which was made
but' a few years before his death, there
is no indication of an Indentation along
the line of the gums such as can be
noticed In persons who hae had their
teeth drawn, een though they wear
artificial ones Howeer, we will con
tinue to answer the same question la
the same way probably many times In
the future"
According to some  biographers
Washington lost his teeth during his
serice as commander in chief of the
Continental army and had a set of
iory ones made These teeth, it is
also stated, gae him much trouble be
cause they did not fit— Washington

RAILWAY RUMBLES
Ireland claims the honor of the first
electric railway In the United King'
dom
It Is said that the cheapest railway
fares in the world are to be found Id
Hungary
Denmark has a goernment railroad
system of 1,167 miles and 525 miles of
priate railroads
The Serian, Roumanian and Bulgs/
rlan railroads are owned exclusiely
by the respectie goernments
Traelers on Prussian railways whose
baggage, through no fault of their
own, fails to arrie with them can now
hae it sent on request frp'e to their
houses
The difficulty of railway construction
In some parts of Africa is illustrated
by the fact that on the Freetown-Mat
tru line, In Sierra Leone, eleen steel
bridges had to be built In a distance of
only thirty kilometers
A representatie of the Paris Temps
has been examining railway stations In
Germany, and he declares that those of
Dresden, Cologne, Hanoer, Frankfort,
Bremen, etc, are far superior to any
of the French except the Parisian
Paying a Creditor
Like many another famous man both
before his time and since, Talleyrand
exhibited, at least in early life, a great
reluctance to settling with his credit
ors When he was appointed bishop of
Antun by Louis XVI, he considered a
fine new coach to be necessary to the
proper maintenance of the dignity of
that office Accordingly a coach was
ordered and deliered, but not paid for
Some time after, as the newly appoint
ed bishop was about to enter his coach,
he noticed a strange man standing near
who bowed continually until the coach
was drien away This occurred for
seeral days until at length Talley
rand, addressing the stranger, saidPersonal
"Well, my good man, who are you?"
"I am your coachmaker, my lord,"
replied the stranger
"Ah," said Talleyrand, "you are my
coachmaker! And what do you want,
my coachmaker?"
"I want to be paid, my lord"
"Ah, yon are my coachmaker, and
you want to be paid? Ton shall be
paid, my coachmaker"
"But when, my lord?"
"Hum," said Talleyrand, settling
himself comfortably among the cush
ions of his new coach and eying his
coachmaker seerely, "you are ery
inquisitie"
Bating; Good Sense
Een men are progressing gastronom
ically Scientific dietetics has at last
reealed to us the fact that the woman
who eats salad on a hot day In July,
August or September Is ' displaying
sound gastronomic sense, says What to
Eat The long haired dreamer In the
restaurant may hae been nineteen dif
ferent kinds of a fool upon eery other
proposition in life, but he knew what
to eat on a hot day The human ani
mal needs grass cr Its equialent In
summer With their oil the salads sup
ply eerything a man physically needs
in hot weather All the ciilized races
of the world are salad eaters, but Amer
icans eat less than do any other people
It Is not a sign of mental decay or mor
al degeneracy for a man to eat salad; it
Is gastronomic sense
