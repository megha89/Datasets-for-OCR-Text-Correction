 WOMN'S RESON
[Original]
There was enough of incident con
centrated in the wedding day of r
mitri Urbanieff and Katharine Tons
kol, two young Russians of the mid
dle class, for a whole lifetime Ur
banieff had returned from his medical
studies in Paris with a light heart, for
Katharine was expecting him, and they
were to be married soon after his ar
rial Personal? f* >
He found domesticated in the home
of Katharine's father Count lexie
ech, who had some months preious
appeared in the illage near by and
*who had brought a letter of introduc
tion to Tonskoi For what he came
and how long he proposed to stay he
gae no information mitri, when he
found the young man so intimate with
the family of his sweetheart, was trou
bled, but he soon made the discoery
that Katharine did not like the count
and this reassured him Why she did
not fancy her father's guest was a puz
zle, for the doctor could see plainly
that the count seemed to desire her fa
or When mitri asked Katharine
for a reason for her prejudice she gae
him no better one than that lexieech
was "cross eyed" mitri laughed at
this feminine reason and thought no
more about the matter
The morning of the wedding day
brought a shock to the community 
Sozen persons in the icinity were ar
rested, and the most harrowing fea
ture was that the young doctor, who
was to hae been married in the een
ing, was among them The prisoners
instead of being gien a trial were hur
ried off to Siberia^ Count lexieech
appeared to be as surprised and indig
nant as any one and olunteered to
start at once for St Petersburg, where
he claimed to hae Influence, to pro
cure the doctor's release mitri was
earnest in his gratitude and begged
the count to strain eery nere to free
him before It should be too late Kath
arine could only cling to her loer, de
spairing of eer seeing him again
fter her loer's departure she passed
a few hours in an agony of despair
Then suddenly a desperate resole took
possession of her She distrusted the
count's promise Shortly preious to
the wedding day he had left her fa
ther's house and taken rooms in the
illage Katharine ordered a drosky
and droe to his rooms Instead of
sending for him to come down she ran
upstairs and knocked at his door She
found him walking the floor, j
"Why are you not on the way to St
Petersburg?" 9he asked
' "I was too late for the 10 o'clock
train There is no other till tomorrow"
I "There is a train on the other road at
 this afternoon You hae only to
drie fie miles to it to catch it"
"Eh? re you sure? I don't beliee
there is time"
"There is time Come I hae a
drosky below I will drie you my
self"
 The count began to busy himself
with preparation, making a great deal
of fuss while doing ery little Katha
rine saw his reoler lying on a table
"You will need this," she said, taking
it up and thrusting it in a pocket of
her dress "Come, we hae no time to
spare" ,Personal ;
lexieech, cramming some brushes
Into a bag, accompanied her downstairs
They got into the drosky Katharine
seized the reins and droe away as
fast as the horse would carry them
; s they were  passing through a
wood Katharine complained that her
fingers were numb and asked the count
to take the reins He had no sooner
done so than he felt something hard
pressed against his neck and heard the
click of a pistol
"Fiend," said Katharine, "I know all
You are one of the chiefs of police and
hae been ferreting out this plot You
hae implicated mitri to get him
out of the way the better to get me
into your clutches I hate you, and I
am going to kill you"
 ''Katharine! For heaen's sake, of
what are you accusing me?"
"Write an order for the release of
mitri or I fire"
"But I hae no authority"
"Write"
The count who had by this time
caught a glance of the girl's desperate
face, took out his notebook, tore out
a leaf, wrote the order and gae it to
her
"rop the reins and get out of the
drosky," she , said He obeyed, and
Katharine, whipping up the horse, was
soon out of sight
She knew that k the route the prison
ers had taken was the one she was on,
their conductor Intending to take them
on the train she had proposed to the
count to take, She soon oertook the
party, produced the order, which was
respected, her loer got into the drosky
and they droe homeward When ap
proaching the illage they saw the
count ahead of them He was walking
with his head bent down on his breast
When they came up to him he looked
up as though in a dream mitri got
out of the drosky and demanded satis
faction for the wrong that had been
done him The count looked at Kath
arine with a hopeless expression, ask
ed her to gie mitri the reoler
and bared his breast mitri turned
away, got Into the drosky and, without
a word from him or Katharine to the
count, droe on
t the hour that had been announced
for the wedding the bride and groom
were ready, and, as the news of mi
tri's release had spread like wildfire,
the guests were assembled The cere
mony passed as quietly as had been
expected
When the bride and groom were
alone together mitri askedPersonal
"Katharine, how did you know the
man was the cause of my arrest?"
"I didn't like the squint in hlfl eyes,"
was her confident reply

"No," said Constance in a tone of
unshakable coniction as she lay, hei
chin propped upon her hands, amid
the subdued richness of the oriental
pillows "No; I might loe a conict 01
I might loe a Hottenot, but a widow
er, neer!"
Her cousin, Mary Singleton, a prac
tical young woman more gien to Jests
than sentiment, eyed her curiously, but
did not speak
"Just fancy," Constance continued,
with scornful derision, "being a man's
second choice, listening to a rehash
of his first loemaking! Gracious!"
Her tone implied that the thing was
well nigh unimaginable, but her cousin
only laughed a bit skeptically and took
the other side of the question
"o you mean to say that because
a person has loed once he — or she,
for that matter — cannot loe again
without feeling that it is a rehash of
the old loe?" she asked, with a yawn!
"My dear girl, you're all wrong! The
second loe is simply a different mat
ter"
"The aerage human being," she
continued shrewdly, "is capable of a
good many loes I don't at all beliee
in these one loe indiiduals — the sort
who mourn foreer, you know That
sort of  thing is simply emotional
poerty" , Personal \0;
Haing deliered herself of this
worldly obseration, she glanced at the
clock and began to coil up her loosened
hair in a way that signified that it was
time that she went to her room to dress
for dinner
"Soulless creature!" taunted Con
stance, with an indulgent but gently
superior air "efend widowers if
you choose, but none of them for me!"
"You girls with fine sentiments,"
Mary retorted teasingly, her hand on
the doorknob, "are just the ones to
look out for" nd she passed out,
smiling, into the hall  moment later
she opened the door again and, thrust
ing her head into the room, said in an
enigmatical mannerPersonal
"By the way Con, be sure to tell
ouglas Stane that when he asks
you!" Then, before her cousin could
reply, she anished, slamming the door
behind her  Personal;•
Constance stood In the middle of the
room for a moment perfectly motion
less, wondering if she could hae heard
aright ouglas Stane a widower!
For of course that was what Mary
ment ouglas Stane a widower! nd
in the four months in which they had
been growing daily fonder of each oth
er she had neer before heard the fact
mentioned
With a quick moement she glided
toward the door and locked It Then,
with her hands clasped with painful
tightness, she stood in the middle of
the room and repeated with growing
IncredulityPersonal " widower! ouglas
Stane a widower!"
"It can't be true— it can't be— it
can't be!" she protested, with a moan
His likeness rose before her — tall,
broad and a bit stern of face Then,
going hot and cold by turns, she sank
down upon the dian once more and
burled her head in the pillows
"Her loer!" That was what her
heart cried out, and, thougrL,she would
not permit herself to say i there was
a wild, sweet bliss in the thought
Subtly she had known it almost from
the first But a widower!
She shiered now at the ery remem
brance of things that had once thrilled
her— the unconscious softening of his
keen eyes when they met hers, the
elusie but unmistakable tenderness of
his tonch when he helped her oer a
rough place or held her wrap Time
was when the caress of his glance
made her blood tingle Now she re
membered it with a sort of loathing
Had his eyes not softened for some
other woman?
Thus she wrestled with loe and pain
until the striking of the clock reminded
her that the dinner hour was at hand
Jumping up, she began to dash cold
water oer her flushed face and wet
eyes, while she tried to steady her
surging emotions
"Eerything went wrong," she apol
ogized when she appeared at the din
ner table rather flurried and breath
less "Couldn't get my hair up right,
hooks wouldn't hook, and buttons
wouldn't button"
Her cousin smiled
"Methinks the lady doth protest too
much," she thought to herself
"ick Just telephoned," she announc
ed, feeling rather small and guilty as
she noted Constance's flushed face and
feerish eyes "He and ouglas Stane
are coming up after dinner to take us
down to the Spouting Rock"
• Constance opened her lips with the
eident intention of declining, but be
fore she could speak her cousin con
tinued gliblyPersonal
 "I Just accepted for both of us be
cause I knew you would like to go"
Then she continued under her breathPersonal
"Poor old ouglas! Wouldn't I like to
hear what she says to him! How shall
I eer make my peace with them I
wonder?"
When, the dinner oer, they sat on
the broad piazza in the twilight she
half regretted her prank and decided
fo speak, but before her good inten
tion crystallized into words Constance
spoke to her, and at the studied indif
ference of the latter's oice and the
marked ennui of her manner all her
loe of mischief returned
"I neer before heard you mention
that Mr Stane in a widower," she said,

patting her lips with one of her fingers
to discourage a yawn '
It ','idn't you?" queried Mary Inno
cently' ' "Perhaps I neer did mention
It" Then at the sound of footsteps on
the grael she added rather; hurriedly,
"on't lay It up against the poor fel
low, though 1 !  Personal Personal  Personal ~
I ' Two dark figures were approaching
from the foot of the lawn If Con
stance jumped at the conclusion that
•ouglas Stane was a widower just be
cause she had said, "Tell that to oug
las Stane when he asks you," it was
her own fault
 Meantime that young lady's greeting
to Mr Stane was a trifle stiff, but no
one but her tormenting cousin noticed
it * The gentleman himself seemed ut
terly unconscious He had determined
to learn his fate, and In the grip of
that mighty resole all minor things
escaped his notice
Mies Singleton seemed bent upon aid
log him, for she and her fiance were
lost to sight around a bend of the road
Stane "Hoohooed!" after the manner
of the cottagers in the neighborhood,
but no answer came back
"eserted us already," he laughed,
his plce a little shaken by the great
question that trembled on his lips
"Let's hurry and catch up with
them," suggested his companion '
"How extremely unflattering!" came
his answer "I was Just longing to
hae you all to myself"
He tried to speak lightly, but eager
ness ibrated in his oice They had
emerged from the groe and stood at
the edge of the rocks
"My dear, dear loel" He took both
of the small bands in bis own and
stood looking down at her, struggling
to speak calmly
"You know — you must know," he
went on eagerly, "that you are the only
woman on earth to me How, I'e
lied all these years without you I 'do
not know I can't face life without
you any longer I neer knew what
It was to lie until I met you"
 quick change came oer Con
stance's face; een In the dim light
he saw it and wondered, and she
wrenched her hands away
"For shame P she said hotly "For
shame! o you think any woman will
loe you better for ignoring her— that
other— the one who in other years was
'all the world' to you?" Personal
She stopped,' unable to go further,
because the tears were choking her
 look of blank amazement oer
spread Stane' s face, and be stared at
her with eyes that were a concentrat
ed interrogation
 "Oh, It seems to me," she went on
passionately, "that If I were a man
and 1 bad once loed a, woman well
enough to marry her, and she had
died, I'd be a little bit true to her
memory! If I wanted care, compan
ionship, whateer It is j that men re
marry for, I'd say so, Instead of pre
tending that I had neer really, loed
before I"
Had she been less wrought up by
her feelings, she might hae noticed
that during this tirade seeral expres
sions fluttered like shadows across her
loer's face stonishment gae way
to understanding, and that in turn to
a grim determination
"I  see," he said slowly, but in a
oice whose ring mnde her look up nt
him with the coniction tlint he was
no longer a suppliant for her faor
"You reject my loe because"—
"Because you hae been married be
fore," she finished stubbornly
"Jenlous of a dead woman," he
mused, looking at her through eyes
narrowed to a mere silt "ll, me!"
Then, as tf the episode 'were closed,
he nskp'l i;uie>tl "Shall we return to
the bouse?"
Slio felt suddenly terrified, bereft
She had expected something ery dif
ferent— expostulation — self justifica
tion  mij itiy struggle was going on
within her But aboe the din of con
tenrtln;Personal filings she board one clear
cry "I loo him! I loe him!" and
slie held out her hands as beseechingly
as a child
"You poor, silly little girl!" he
whisperod in a oice of great content
asbe swept her up In his arms, "Who
eer told you that absurd tale? But
I'e proed to you that you would
hae loed me een if I had been!"

Once there was a man who complain

"Then you hae no right to kick,"
they told him "It is the duty of eery

Whereupon he began attending the
primaries
He worked faithfully for the nomina
tion of sober, honest and reputable can
didates
But it did no good 
The other fellows turned out in great
er numbers and outoted him, and bad
men were nominated and elected to of
fice as before |
He felt that he had a right to kick
this time, and he complained again
"o you attend the primaries?" his
hearers asked him
"I do"
"Then you ought to keep your mouth
shut," they said "You are a part of
the crowd that nominates these bad
men, and you are responsible for them"

But when we speak of the entire em

"It is not," he meditatiely conclud
ed, "uninteresting to  reflect that off
the eastern and western boundaries of
the greatest mass of land in the world
there should exist an Insignificant
group of islands inhabited in each case
by a people of ery mixed origin and
ery mixed characters, each of whom
expresses its defiance of its geograph

 good story of an old crofter who
appeared before the commission to ap
ply for a reduction of rent was recently
told at a meeting in Glasgow The
number of cattle on the farm led Sher
iff Brand to obsere that surely the
croft could not be In such a bad way
as Its owner would seek to show
"Och," replied the old fellow, "you
should see the bit beastles" "What
like ore they?" queried the sheriff
"They're as lean, sir, as Pharaoh's
klne" "How lean was that?" "asked
the sheriff, doubtless thinking that he
had cornered the applicant But had
he? Not a bit Like a flash came back
the answer, "So lean, sir,  that they
could only be eaten in a ision"
Shocked the Court,
 writer in "Law Notes," speaking of
the late John MacMahon, saysPersonal "Mac
Mahon's style was painfully heay, his
utterance a little thick, and he was en
tirely deoid of humor His hearing at
times was not of the best, and for that
reason he thought it was the best poli
cy to agreejlth any remark that might
be madeBy??he Judge before whom he
was appearing, een though he did not
happen to hear what had been said
On one occasion he was appearing be
fore a master of the rolls, who thought
that MacMahon was | arguing rather
elementary law for such a court as his
'You are speaking as if I were a mere
tyro in the law, Mr MacMahon,' said
the master of the rolls testily 'Quite
so, my lord,' said counsel airily, pro
ceeding with his argument, obliious
to and regardless of what the judge
had said"

HOW TO WIN  HUSBN
Woman's! sphere in this 20th century is
not limited any more than is man's She
can occupy almost any business position
or profession, and yet the popular iew of
womanhood is that she best fits the posi
tion of wife and mother and head of the
household Eery girl should know her
heart and also know that her womanly
system is equal to the strain of marriage
If a girt is nerous and irritable ten chances
to one it is due to some trouble peculiar to
womanhood
Cupid has no place in a girl's heart if
she is nerous and irritable, feels dragged
down, worn out for no reason that she can
think of The weak back, dizzy spells and
black circles about the eyes are only symp ,
toms Go to the source of the trouble and
conect the irregularity Stop the drains
on the womanly system and the other
symptoms will disappear This can be
done easily and intelligently So sure of
it is the World's ispensary Medical sso
ciation, the proprietors of r Pierces Fa
orite Prescription, that they offer $500
reward for women who cannot be cured of
leucorrhea, female weakness, prolapsus, or

FISH N GME LWS
"It is*' not our intention in this
article to recite the Fish and Game
laws, neither do we intend to say
that there should be no laws for the
partial protection of fish and game
But we are going to say, and say it
honestly, that rnay of the present
fish and game laws of this state and
county should neer hae been en
acted Their proisions are un
reasouable and should neer hae
been adopted by a legislatie body
i a country where the fundamental
law of the land declares for life, lib
erty and the pursuit of happiness
The doe law is a farce It was
gotten up wholly in the interest of
the few as against the many That
was demonstrated i Jackson and
eery other town\in the county on
the first day of July One out of
eery 25 men in Jackson was out
before sunrise and many of them
were the men who hae been so
anxious to see that innocent boy or
man punished who was ignorant
of the exacting proisions of the
law, and went forth perhaps to pro
cure game with which to feed a hun
gry family or proide an appetizing
broth for an inalid sister or mother
lit was just as cruel, just as inhu
man to kill a doe on the first of
July as on the first of June, for the
nests are full of young ones een at
the present time, and if the mother
bird is destroyed on July Ist the
helpless young ones will perish just
as quickly as though the parent bird
had been killed on June Ist t no
other time during the summer sea
son hae the hunters of the large
cities a better opportunity to hunt
than the first of July Personal ll work is
generally suspended on the th and
there was no more opportune time
for the open season to begin than on
the first of July when the profes
sional hunter can kill or cripple
them all within a few days The
fish law is een worse Fish are a
luxury, especially mountain trout,
but unless you can spare the time
and money to go and catch them
yourself you must do without It is
not safe to een beg a dozen from
your friend who has them to throw
away Your pockets may be full of
money, your children may be crying
for trout and your eyes may be rest
ing upon a hundred dozen or more
that may be thrown to the dogs; but
if you ask to buy a dozen, and suc
ceed in getting them, you as well as
well as the seller hae committed a
crime that may send you to the
state's prison for the remainder of
your natural life No person can
buy or sell a trout that weighs less
than a half pound, and not one in
1000 that are found in our moun
taiu streams are aboe that weight
The game laws are for a certain
class Not the rich against the
poor but the professional hunters
against all others Those who are
sworu to enforce the laws must do
so, but those who hae the power to
create laws should scrutinize them
closely before putting their stamp
of approal upon them
California at St Louis
From all accounts if one wants to
know something of California and her
wonderful resources he had best go to
St Louis and obsere the grand ex
hibit It is 'said that the Goernor of
the state knew nothing of his state un
til he went east and assisted in dedicat
ing the arious departments of our
wonderful display Some of our coun
ties hae een surpassed our sister
states Our wines, grains, fruits, etc
are attracting the attention of isitors
from eery quarter esigns of all
kinds made of the products of our soil
are in eidence eerywhere Prune
horses, orange houses, wine and olie
oil monuments, raisins in eery con
ceiable figure, marble  slabs, hewn
logs and logs in their natural state all
go to add to the aried resources of our
golden state California neer does
anything by hales, she knows how to
do, she has the resources to do with,
and we will not be surprised to hoar in
the end that she has not only fairly
outstripped eery other state and re
ceied the first prize, but also a far
greater prize by adding to her popula
tion some of the most substantial farm
ing, elements of the world
There is more catarrh in this section
of the country than all other diseases
put together, and until the last few
years was supposed to be incurable
For a great many years doctors pro
nounced it a local disease, and prescrib
ed locai remedies, and by constantly
failing tocure with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable Science has
proen catarrh to be a constitutional
disease, and therefore requires consti
tutional treatment Hall's Catarrh

Will isplay California's Wealth
The display of California's aßt and
almost inexhaustible resources will form
one of the most attractie features of
the Triennial Conclae Coming from
eery part and section of the State, the
immense ariety and wealth of the pro
duct will astonish the isitors from
abroad and be a reelation to many
Californians who hae but scant know
ledge of the resources of the State out
side their own section  Each county
and section will install the exhibit of
its resources at the headquarters of the
Commandery stationed within its
boundaries, either some large hall or
in the parlors and reception rooms of
the hotel where the Commandery
makes its headquarters In ome cases
two or more Commanderies stationed
at distant places will share headquart
ers and exhibit and entertain jointly;
while in seeral instances Commander
ies stationed at distant places will share
headquarters and exhibit and entertain
jointly While the display of Califor
nia fruit, flowers, grain and other pro
duce of field and farm, orchard and
ineyard, must proe ery interesting,
for California leads the world in that
respect, the mineral exhibit from the
mother lode and other mining regions
will be not less attractie, especially to
those who hae neer seen the precious
metal wrested from the bowels of the
earth
The Conclae is to be made the oc
casion for a general reunion of Sir
Knights who dwell far from their for
mer home, where they hae been orig
inally knighted, and many interesting
meetings, after years of separation will
take place Personal
There are thirtynine flourishing
Commandries in the Grand Jurisdiction
of California, with an aggregate of 5,000
members, and nearly eery one of those
will attend the Conclae and bring his
family with him Thousands of others,
outside the Order, will take the adant
age of the low rates and go to San
Francisco, because they will be able to
see more in the metropolis of the
Pacific during the Conclae week than
they could possibly see during a year
at any other time Californians roalize
that it is safer to show the wonderful
things which grow in California, when
telling strangers about them, and as
long as the strangers can not isit eery
part and section of the State, will bring
the proofs of California's wealth right
to San Francisco that all may feast
their eyes upon them and go back to
their respectie home to tell what they
hae seen, and show the souenirs they
will carry home with them

On Saturday eening, June 25th,
the Jackson Parlor gae a grand anni
ersary ball, the order haing been in
existence in Jackson 20 years The oc
casion was a most enjoyable one and
was conducted in a manner that reflect
ed great credit upon those who had
the affair In charge Not a man was
allowed to pass the outer door without
first procuring a ticket, and not a per
son who entered was allowed to smoke
without passing out beyond the outer
door Tho rule was Btrictly enforced
and we are free to say that it was the
first time we eer attended a dance in
a mountain town where we did not see
congregated in some corner a lot of
boys or menpuffing away at cigars and
cigarettes The time between dances
was taken up by the home boys in in
troducing the many strangers present
to the young ladies One young man
from Lodi remarked in our hearing
that he was surprised at the unusual
attention paid to strangers The music
was all that could be desired, j The
Stockton orchestra has the reputation
of furubhing nothing but firstclass
music and they fully satisfied eery one
present both as to quantity and qual
ity The affair was not gotten up as a
money making scheme but simply to
cemmemorate the lodge anniersary
The most that was hoped for was to
come out een This the boys did and
are oerjoyed with the congratulations
they hae receied upon the excellent
management during the entire eening

The th in Jackson
No attempt to publicly celebrate the
nations birthday t was made by the
citizens of Jackson  Eery person
who could secure any semblance of a
rie', riding pony or jack, went either to
Plymouth or to Mokelumne Hill Some
een walked to attend the dance Those
who remained in town spent the day
socially ll places of business were
closed in the afternoon excepting those
that had fire works to sell and the
saloons uring the day the children
kept the town noisy by tho burning of
firecrackers, aud in the eening many
of the oliiir ones let a patriotic hand
and kept the bombs exploding until
quite a late hour We noticed that
the foreign population of the town spent
a considerable sum in the purchase of
fireworks By doing this they taught
their children a lesson on patriotism
that will not soon be forgotten In
terest in an historical question must be
created in some unsuspecting way
The roar of cannon, the sound of the
bugle, the waing of Him Hair and the
shouts of assembled niulu'uries create
in the minds of the younger generation
a desire to know what it all means
The history of the Reolution is taken
down and and the reader at once be
comes filled with his importance
as a successor to one of thoso who
sacrificed so much for us and at once
becomes a true patriot, and a teacher
of patriotism to those who follow after
him Jackson should celebrate July
th 1905 The young people of the town
need the inspiration that it would gie
them The matter should be taken
up in earnest early in the spring and
pressed to a successful isaue
Volcano Smallpox Case
Quite a number of bills were present
ed to the Board of Superisors Monday
by parties who assisted in one way or
another in taking care of, or furnish
ing supplies to John Harker Jr While
suffering from smallpox in Volcano
Most of the bills had been O K'd by
the county health officer, and the
istrict ttorney passed them up to the
superisors without his signature
Some members of the board first re
fused'to sign, not being able to under
stand how it was that it took two white
men and a chinaman to care for the
patient County clerk Culbert finally
suggested that it took the chinaman to
watch the sluk man and the two white
men to watch the chinaman This
1 cleared matters a little and most of the
bills were signed There wore two bilh
for similar articles one from Clute's and
one from L Crssinelli & Bro but sup
erisor Grillo explained that one was
for the Chinaman, the other for the
patient and they were allowed Mr
Frank Clute of the St George hotel
furnished the food the patient and at
tendant ute and his bill was also scru
tinized The sum total was between
$75 and $100 which at first glance seem
ed to be exorbitant, but as the disease
was kept from spreading it may be
ery reasonable after all
The th in Plymouth
The th in Plymouth was a decided
success Eery person who went from
Jackson speaks in praise of the satis
factory manner in which the program
was carried out to the letter The
amusements pleaded old and young
alike, and tho people of the town
showed by their eery endeaor that
it was carried out on patriotic lines and
not as a money making scheme
lthough the crowd was larger than
expected the church ladies and hotel
proprietors had prepared for just such
a surprise, and found no difficulty in
feeding all The oration by Hon U C
Rust was full of patriotic sentiment and
eoked frequent applause from the at
tentie listeners The singinsf was
greatly appreciated and the band kept
playing from early morn till late at
night The horsorace was one of the
best eer seen in the county  Plym
outh horse won by a scant margin from
Greenback, owned by Mr Reees of
mador The fireworks, horribles
and balloon ascension made the early
eening an enjoyable one The dance,
from a financial standpoint, was the
greatest success of all, but the" hall was
so crowded that it was almost impossi
ble to dance We regret that the
scarcity of coneyances preented
many of our patriotic citizens from
being present We are unable to gie
the names of winners of the principal
eent May mador county hae
many such celebrations that her peo
ple may become better citizens thereby
eath of I IT Neeley
Mr Isaac Newton Neeley, who for
merly conducted the Enterprise liery
stable in Jackson, but of late years a
resident of Milton, died at his home
Friday eening surrounded by friends
and relaties The immediate cause of
death was a rupture of a blood essel
on the brain Mr Neeley was born in
Pennsylania 73 years ago, and came
to California and settled in Volcano,
mador county, in 1850 uring his
stay in Volcano he married and from
that union he leaes a son and three

THE MOU LEGERPersonal JCKSOff, CLIFORNI, FBIY, JULY 8, 190
 TRIP TO THE
WORL'S FIR
t the Fair
Hae been here a week and isied
the exposition eery day I shall not
attempt to gie an account of the
sights in this letter, but Instead will
'confine myself to general topics Many
erroneous ideas preail as to the con
ditions here which ought to be ex
ploded Before coming I heard much
about the heat of St Louis, and the In
conenience therefrom in June and
July Newspapers hae publlcy pro
claimed St Louis the hottest large city
on earth in July That may be so, as
I am not prepared to say what July
may bring forth Judging from the
last week of June, it may be set down
as a slander Eightysix is the highest
temperature recorded since we arried
Tbere is a peculiarty in the heat, ow
ing to the humidity in tho atmosphere;
at the same time a cool, refreshing
breeze is always present to temper the
sun's rays Visitors from cold coun
tries might feel the heat, but certainly
those from Central California will suf
fer little therefrom
nother thing may be mentioned
herePersonal tbere is no lack of rooming ac
commodations The fair has brought
an enormous influx of people; but the
accommodations hae more than kept
pace with the demand The city could
take care of twice the number of tran
sients than are now within its limits
Naturally, rents hae adanced, and
rooming charges hae adauced like
wise The spirit of gouging is not
missing, and unless the isitor is cau
tious he is apt to fall a ictim Charges
of $3 per day upwards for each person
for room alone is common, and often
the accommodations are of the poorest
character I hae reached the conclu
sion that those bouses sending out cir
culars to induce persons to secure
rooms in adance, and offering reduced
rates if so secured, are mostly frauds
The "cheaper rate" is held out
simply to entrap the unwary By look
Ingaround the isitor soon finds that he
might hae gotten better accommoda
tions for less money elsewhere Stran
gers will do well to steer clear of these
tieup concerns under whateer guise
they are operated The better plan is
to secure a temporary place the first
night, and employ the first hours in
the city in looking around for suitable
quarters It will not take long to do
this, unless the taste be of the extreme
fastidious order We are domiciled in
the residence part of the city on el
mar bouleard with a priate family,
at $1 per day each, which la reasonable
under the circumstances
On the fair grounds eerything in
the eating and drinking line is high
The graball spirit is there in all its
glory There are exceptions, but tney
are few and far between  drink of
water costs 5 cents; a meal cannot be
had for less than 75 cents or $1; straw
berries and cream 30 cents— fully
double the cost of edibles outside the
grounds Why this extortionate sched
ule is tolerated is not clear Certainly
it militates against the restaurants on
the fair grounds— and they are thick as
leaes in autumn Many isitors de
cline to be held up in this way, and
pack their lunches with them They
would not do so if reasonable prices
preailed s a rule people expect to
pay an extra price for things, but tney
draw the line on extortion Two young
fellows from Pennsylania came to
spend a week at the fair t the expi
ration of two days they packed up and
left When asked tho reason, they
said they would like to hae stayed,
but they were "soaked" and "stuck,"
as they expressed it, all along the line,
and were thereby compelled to curtail
their isit Maybe the concessionaires
hae paid so much for tbo priilege of
doing business within the fair grounds
that they hae to charge skyward
prices If 60 the policy was a mistaken
one as far as applied to eating and
drinking necessaries To us it seams
that the management might hae reg
ulated these charges at least
s to the exposition itself, it is grand
beyond all precedent That which im
presses the isitor on taking a tour of
the world's fair is its immensity
Eerything is on a scale of greatness
neer before attempted The buildings
are of immense size, and scattered oer
120 acres One has to do a heap of
walking to get een a feeble idea of this
wonderful exhibition The next im
pression is the beauty of the buildings,
considering they are merely temporary
structures The agricultural building
— the largest on the grounds— coers
21 acres To walk through all its'
aisles, one would hae to trael seen
miles It Is needless to say that it is
impossible to get more than a hasty
iew of een a small portion of the ex
hibits from a stay of two weeks To
do the fair fully would require months
It is beyond human endurance to see it
all, or een the major part of it It is
a marelous collection of the works of
nature and of man, dwarfing all pre
ious efforts in the same line It shows
the deelopment in all branches of
human actiity, from the crude prod
ucts of primitie times to the amazing
achieements of tho present
In conclusion, we may say we hae
seen most of the buildings, the Philli
pine and Indian illages, and the prin
cipal sights on the Pike The most
wonderful piece of machinery on the
ground, to my notion, Is connected
with the printing trade, and consists
of a typecasting and setting inention
called the Monotype It may be seen
In actual operation, setting matter
from copy made by a type writer de
signed specially for Monotype work,
producing an exact duplicate In type of
the characters impressed upon the
typewritten manuscript It is the
nearest approach to infusing brains
Into a mechanical deice that we hare
yet seen R W

The ssessment for 190
The following figures show the as
sessed aluation of property in mador
county for the year 1903Personal
In township No 1 there is an appar
ent decrease of $60,316, while in all
the other townships there is a substan
tial gain In township No 3, there is
an apparent gain of $135,610 This is
accounted for mainly from the fact
that heretofore all the property belong
to the Standard Electric* Co was as
sessed in township No 1 The work is
now so nearly completed that the as
sessor has been able to seggregate the
property and gie to township No 3
what rightfully belongs to it The
property in township No 1 has in
creased in alue just the same as in the
other townships, but the surrendering
to No 3 its portion of the Standard
Electric property makes the apparent
decrease This will add materially to
the road fund of No 3 and will enable
Superisor Grillo to do much more
work during the coming year This is
the first time in the history of the
county that the assessment has reached
the $5,000,000 mark There are 266,
809 acres of assessable lands in the

Imagine such distinguished men as
 M elmas, W J McGee and M F
Tarpey, dressed in knee pants, stand
ing In the corridor of one of the largest
hotels in St Louis singing at the top
of their oices, the following silly little
conglomeration of words, thinking that
by a certain emphasis of a particular
word a candidate of meager ability
could be fostered upon the democratic
party as a fit personage to become
president of the United States
THE SONQ
Boom! Booml Boom!
First! First! First!
California, California,
Hearst! Hearst! Hearst!
t first it was considered a great bis
joke gotten up by some wag as a take
off on the prominent men who com
posed the State delegation, but the
next issue pf the Hearst papers repro
duced it in glaring type on the first
page and heralded It as the battle cry
that would down all others So often
was it reprinted that people began to
think that "Willie" wrote it himself
and many heralded it as the greatest
of his recent productions It proed
no joke but a reality  part of the
California delegation actually assem
bled in one of the corridors of a large
hotel, braced themseles firmly and let
off a blast at the top of their oices
No one shouted; another, and a death
ly silence preailed ; a third, and the
dry bones of Willies latest effusion
lay prostrate upon the floor In a
short time elmas was looking for a
acant lot in which to nominate Hearst
McGee was interiewing a natie Ha
waiian as to the probable eruption of
the Island olcanoes, and Tarpey was
looking for a Cuban representatie to
ascertain if possible whether Rooseelt
was actually at the battle of San Juan
and how he thought Hearst would run
in the Island Republic
Such methods of creating enthusiasm
are things of the past Such frosts
should neer be placed upon the shoul
ders of delegates Let candidates do
as W J Bryan did in 1896, come be
fore the conention and by word and
action show to the conention that
they are worthy and capable and they
will receiesupport Hearst is a dead
issue, acknowledged to be so by all
sae himself, and we will say in justice
to our townsman, W J McGee, that we
will bet he was not in hearing distance
of that hotel at the time of the song

unable to rise more than a few feet
from the ground and then fluttered
helplessly to earth i Three times it es
sayed flight and then gaspingly gae it
up and was restored to Its cage Con
finement or injury at the time of its

THE OPIUM CIGRETTE
[Original]
"What's the meaning of this crowd?"
I asked of a railroad official at tie
Charing Cross station, London
"The Russian, sir"
"What Russian?"
"on't know, sir He's some big
man In his country These people are
to see him off, sir He's going home"
I stepped into the compartment
Where I had engaged a seat There I
found two elderly women with seeral
children, all of one party Beyond, by
a window, sat a young woman whose
appearance interested me at once
Neer hae I seen such an expression
on any human face The only descrip
tion I can gie of It is that it reminded
me of a picture I had once seen of an
early Christian' martyr who had nered
herself to be burled alie But this
gies only a ague idea of the woman's
whole appearance She was well
dressed, and her features and bearing
indicated one of the highest class It
was impossible for her to conceal a
mental restlessness that showed itself
especially in the eyes, which were
constantly moing
The train made but one stop between
London and Folkestone, where the
party of women and children got out,
leaing only me and the woman I hae
been trying to describe in the com
partment
"Thank heaen," she said to me In a
contralto oice, "they are gone! I am
sure you will not object to my smoking
a cigarette in this compartment,
though it Is not a smoker" •
"Certainly not, madam"
V'You speak French?" she asked in
that language
' I assured her that I did, and after
that we conersed in the French lan
guage I took out some cigarettes and
lighted one to keep her company, but
she Insisted on my smoking one of
hers, which, she said, had been made
expressly for her from a recipe fur
nished by a member of the suit of the
sultan of Turkey I threw mine away
and took one of hers I knew at once
that it contained opium, but how much
or what other drugs I did not know
One thing I did know I was rapidly
passing into a delightful trance, which
eery whiff seemed to make still more
delightful I saw the woman watching
me, and when she was satisfied that I
was powerless she opened a hand bag
beside her and took out something
rolled in brown paper, opened it, took
out a wedge shaped piece of wood and,
seizing my chin, opened my mouth and
gagged me
 This done, she took out a timetable,
which she scanned, looked at her
watch, cast a glance out of the win
dow, then momentarily gae way to a
terrible depression I judged that she
was obliged to wait for something, and
on the ee of some moe — one inol
ing life and death, 'for< instance— there
Is nothing like delay to break one
down I noticed that we were passing
through a thickly settled district and
that as Boon as we had passed again
Into the country she nered herself
and prepared for something she was
about to do
Her first act was to disrobe But in
stead of displaying the undergarments
of a woman she lay bare a man's out
er clothing Her woman's attire was
merely a coering, which she threw
out of the window Next she took a
glass globe about two inches in diam
eter from her satchel, and the satchel
followed the clothing Then she— or
rather he, for by this time I had made
up my mind that the person was a
young man— cast a glance at me which
seemed to satisfy him, took another
look at his watch, peered out at the
passing landscape and after casting up
bis eyes and muttering a prayer
climbed out of the window and let him
self down on the footboard
Had I not been under the influence of
opium I should hae been profoundly
moed by all this s it was it seem
ed but a part of my dream, and the
moment the singular being passed out
of it he was forgotten I remember be
ing jarred by an explosion, but did not
at the time connect it with the young
man
Whateer occurred was hushed up
When we reached Folkestone a guard
was obliged to carry me on to the
channel boat, and I did not come to
myself again before we reached
Boulogne I did not get an oppor
tunity to interiew any of the passen
gers, and the whole affair was to me
something of a mystery Indeed I fan
cied I had dreamed it under the influ
ence of an opium cigarette If a bomb
was really exploded with a iew to kill
ing the Russian official in another com
partment, It failed My theory, based
on the iew that it was a real occur
rence, was that the assailant dropped
the bomb before he was ready to ex
plode it in or under the compartment
occupied by the Russian
Two years afterward I was in St
Petersburg standing In a crowd watch
Ing for the smperor to pass on his way
to reiew some of his troops mong
the members of his staff I saw a face
that astonished me I neer forget
faces, and I certainly could neer for
get this one It was the face of the
young man who had drugged me on the
train between Boulogne and Folke
stone Happening to glance down upon
me, he caught my astonished glance,
which doubtless helped him to recog
nize me The caalcade passed on, and
I returned to my hotel
That night I was trying ainly to
sleep, for I was troubled about being
recognized as a nihilist and been rec
ognized by hip in the czar's suit, when
there was & knock on the door, and a
man entered
"There is a midnight train for the
border," he said "Get up and take
it"
In an hour I was on the train with
my isitor, who saw me Into another

For iamonds
[Copyright, 190, by C B Lewis]
The house of Sloane, Saunders & Co,
London, had receied a letter from Sir
James Blankton, liing about a mile
out of the illage of Morpeth, asking
them to send down a man with dia
monds for nlarriage presents It was
Hided that his carriage woind meet
the man at the station at C o'clock in
Ibe eening I was the one selected to
go, and I reached Morpeth on time
iith £5,000 worth of diamonds con
cealed about my person '
 carriage awaited me, but 1 had
uardly taken a seat in it when I had
queer feeliugs The outfit was too
common to be owned and publicly
used by such a man as Sir James
Blankton, and the two men on the box
didn't appear at all like serants I
made bold to sayPersonal
"See here, men 1 think there is a
mistake I think I hae got Sir James
Blankton mixed up with Sir James
ashton It is the latter who owns
a large interest in a Manchester cot
ton factory, isn't it?"
"It may be, but I dunno," replied the
man who was driing as he pulled up
his horses
"Well, you see, I wanted to show
him some of these new dyes for cot
tons"
"Is that your line, sir?"
"Yes 1 liue ten new colors just out
I am sorry for the blunder, but I am
willing"— ifr'c
"Then what the bloody blazes did
you get into this turnout for?"
'•To see Sir James Blankton, of
course I got it in my head" —
"Oh, blow your 'cad and your 'eels
too! Jim, turn about and drie the
bloomln' ass back to town!"
"I'll be shot if I does!" replied Jim
"He can get right out 'ere and take
'isself back on his own legs and be
blowed to him!"
When I had walked the two miles
and reached town, I went to a hotel
Inside of fie minutes I had learned
that Sir James Blankton lied in the
opposite direction to that I had taken
Further, thPersonalPersonalt the gentleman and his
wife had boon in Scotland for seeral
weeks It did not take me long to
figure it out to my perfect satisfaction
It was a put up job to rob the London
house through me, and it had been put
up with the aid of some one at Sir
James Blankton's house
I started for London by the 9 o'clock
train The night had come on dark and
stormy, and there were but few pas
sengers from Morpeth There were
two plain women ticketed to urham
and a man about forty years old of
pleasing address and genteel appear
ance The four of us were ushered
Into the same compartment s soon
as we fell into conersation the man
gae me to understand that he lied
at Beerly, a town about fifty miles
down the line, and from certain words
let fall I gathered that he was a prom
inent public official of the place I
didn't exactly reply that I was In the
dye line, but he probably inferred as
much from what I said I was glad of
his company He was well posted, a
fair talker  "„
The women got out at urham and
left us alone We passed arlington
and  were still the sole occupants of
the compartment Mr rnold, as he
had gien his name, had been sitting
opposite me for an" hour s the train
cleared arlington, howeer, he rose
up and yawned and saidPersonal
"I am sleepy, and yet I can neer
get a wink of sleep on the train By
the way, I found a curious coin on the
street at Morpeth today Can you make
anything of it?"
He had a coin in his fingers as be
stepped oer to me I reached out a
hand to receie It when he seized me
by the throat with both hands and had
me on my back ln a second I was no
match for him in strength He gripped
my throat so suddenly and so fiercely
that I was depried of all powers of
resistance Bending oer me, with his
knee on my chest, he finally let up on
his clutch and saidPersonal
"on't be foolish now! I know you
and am after those diamonds"
He drew a wicked looking knife and
held It in his teeth, while he used some
stout cord to tie my hands behind my
back Why didn't I resist? Simply
because his clutch on my throat had
almost paralyzed me When he had
taken the key of my Gladstone from
one of my pockets he turned me oer
and saidPersonal
"Now for the sparklers I know you
shifted them to* the bag when you were
at the hotel  deuced fine layout, and
the cash alue must be close to f 10,000
It's a pretty haul indeed, and no risk
attending it"
He placed the jewel case in his pock
et, lighted a cigar and pleasantly con
tinuedPersonal
"Take it easy, my boy The next
stop is North llerton, and I shall gag
you and leae the train there You'll
be discoered at Leeds or sooner"
I was so mad and my throat hurt me
bo much that I made no attempt to re
ply fter a couple of minutes the
train slackened speed, and in sixty sec
onds more it had come to a standstill
"Special stop, is it?" growled the rob
ber as he took a gag from his pocket
and bent oer me "Well, here goes to
keep you quiet while I get away"
'Just then the guard opened the door
to admit two passengers, and I began
to yell at the top of my oice The
robber made a bolt for it, and he would
hae got off temporarily at least but
for an accident He caught his foot
and fell heaily on the platform, and
before he could rise the guards had
him secure The job had been put up
between him and the two men who
d/oe me, assisted by a maid in Sir
James Blankton's house, and I had the
satisfaction of seeing the quartet sent
to prison for long terms M QU

The War He Made Hl* Opponent Win
a Cone For Him
Lord Brampton, a famous English
cross examiner, told a story of how he
once won a case on a technical ground
when he had no defense He forced a
magistrate's clerk to be put into the
witness box by; the prosecution to
proe a purely formal matter Now,
haing got him there, he cross exam
ined him and made him practically
admit that he "led his magistrates by
the nose;" to admit also that they had
refused ball by his adice and that a
judge at chambers had afterward
granted it, although the witness had
come up all the way from London to
oppose It Then, asked the cross ex
aminer, "You were in the room, sir,
and did you not hear the learned judge
say there was not a rag of a case
against my unhappy client?" The
prosecuting counsel objected, and It
was ruled out But the Jurors had
heard it and had heard the answer
stopped The dissatisfaction thus ad
duced ln their minds made them acquit
the prisoner Leaing the court that
day, the prisoner's counsel asked his
opponent, "Why did you object to that
question 7' The latter indignantly
protested that his adersary  when he
asked It must hae known that It
could not be put "Yes, I did," was the
answer; "but I knew you, too, and
felt sure that you would object at the
right time But you should hae wait
ed for the answer, as It would hae
been 'No!' "

Inestigated was a robbery of about
half a lakh of rupees' worth of siler
Ingots (about $25,000) that was sent
down on camels with an escort of fif
teen armed men from Indore to Kotah
The escort was killed by acoits and
the siler taken Isrl Pershad, the ori
ental Sherlock Holmes, rasseldar major
of a natie regiment, made it his busi
ness to bring these men to justice and
when asked ln after years how he ob
tained his proofs remarked, smilingly
stroking his beard, that if a man was
judiciously strung up, spread eagle
wise, by his thumbs, much useful In
formation might be extracted, and,
haing no marks of 111 treatment to
show to the sahibs, he generally held
his tongue Of a certain witness in
this case he wrote that he had "gien
'awfully good eidence' at the trial, but
as there was 'Just a little discrepancy'
between this and his preious deposi
tions before the political agent, when
the original files were called for by the
higher court, 'It would be better to
omit this one and say It had been eaten
by white ants 1 "

tOrUflaaJ!
t the first station after crossing the
Itussian border a man got into the
compartment, took a seat directly op
posite me, pulled out a newspaper and
began to read I was reading too
Presently, probably actuated by
thought transference, probably by co
incidence, we raised our eyes to each
other at the same moment The man
turned quickly and looked out of the
window I resumed my reading When
I looked up again his eyes were fixed
upon me '''J
I carefully noted the man's appear
ance, lie wore a brown beard, while
his hair was black and sprinkled with
gray He was tall and slender, with
a slight stoop He looked more re
spectable than his clothes, which were
ery shabby
That eening while at supper at my
inn I suddenly felt an Inclination to
look up My eyes met those of the
man with the brown beard This time
there was a slight scowl on his face,
but he lowered his eyes to his plate
and went on with his supper
In the morning I proceeded on my
journey, stopping again the next een
ing While sitting In the office smok
ing who should come in but this man,
who I was now fully coninced was
shadowing me s he passed me he
started, but whether his surprise was
real or feigned I could not make out
He put down his belongings, except a
morocco coered box  serant who
gathered up the traps • attempted to
take the box as well, but the man held
on to It nerously
I am something of a detectie, and
the Incident, though trifling, interested
me Was not the box an Infernal ma
chine, and did not the man take me for
a high Russian official traeling incog?
The next day I took a train for St
Petersburg, not needing to stop oer
night, for the distance was but a hun
dred miles On entering my compart
ment I noticed that there was but a
single person In it besides myself Tak
ing my seat, I let down p window for
better air, arranged my belongings,
then, while taking a book from my
satchel, glanced at my fellow passen
ger
He was the man' with the brown
beard '•' Personal '
 moment later, though I was not
looking directly at him, I saw him tug
ging at something under his oercoat
as though he were getting a reoler
into a position where he could use it
expedltlously My conscience was so
clear of any intention that would call
his weapon into serice that' l simply
gae him a contemptuous glance, then,
* opening my book, began to read fter
awhile I dropped It on my lap and
sank into a light slumber But before
losing consciousness I saw my shadow
er nerously reaching under his seat
to feel for his box and casting suspi
cious glances at me
I was awakened by something strik
ing heaily against me Opening my
eyes, I saw the man with the brown
beard  trying to regain his balance,
haing eidently been thrown upon me
by a lurch of the coach But what
was my surprise and, I will admit con
sternation to see* that be held a re
oler within a foot of my nose '
"Sit still!" he cried In English 'If
I yon dare moe I'll blow out your
brains!"
> Thunderstruck, especially at being
I addressed in my natie tongue, I made
[ no reply
"Your game Is blocked,'' he said
"My game?"
"Yes I hae you coered and at the
next station shall turn you oer to the
police" ',' >";' '">Personal
"oes the czar 'employ English de
| tecties?"
"You can't throw me off the track by
assuming to be a nihilist I know your
intentions"
"Well, I'll be obliged to yon if yon
will tell me what they are"
"What they are? You know ery
well what they are— the Jewels" '
"What Jewels 7"
i Perhaps it was my unfeigned look of
astonishment that threw a shade of
• doubt, of perplexity, across bis face
"o you mean to tell me," he said,
) "that you hae not information con
\ cerning me and my acts; that you hae
not shadowed me eer since I crossed
the border; that you hae not been
> waiting an opportunity to possess
I yourself of the treasure; that before
? we had been long in this compartment
' you would hae chloroformed me,
seized my box and left the train at the
1 first stop?"
I had so recently awakened and the
adenture was so surprising ttiat I
could not for some time quite gather
my faculties This, howeer, gae me
time to see the absurdity of the matter
"You're a fool," I blurted out at last,
I "and so am I I thought you were
shadowing me"
"Shadowing you? What for?"
"The goernment"
[ The strained expression on his face
 melted into an amused smile
' "Who are you?" he asked '
" citizen of Philadelphia"
; "Philadelphia! So am I"
We pulled out cards and exchanged
them
"Why, you are the gentleman," said
Personal I, "whose daughter recently married
Count enizoff of St Petersburg"
"Yes, and I am taking her the fam
ily jewels"
"nd you mistook me for a robber?"
I said
"nd you mistook me for a member
' t>f the secret police"
Still trembling, he opened a bag, took
out a flask and offered it to me
"Thank you," I said, glad enough
myself to get a bracer "Here's to the
amateur detectie serice of merica"
He smiled grimly, I returned the
flash, and he emptied it
