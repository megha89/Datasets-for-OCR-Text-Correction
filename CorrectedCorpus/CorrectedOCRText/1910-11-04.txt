Nohing more in he way of a recep

in Explaining Case
The chief burden of he speeches of
U S Gregory and C P Vicini
hroughou he couny has been o
clear hemseles in he maer of he
uncolleced licenses and free licenses
o John Rao The fallacy of he
argumens resored o in he effor o
befog he people on his issue needs o
be shown In defense of Kao's
freedom from conribuing anyhing
oward he suppor of he couny
goernmen hese adocaes of non
paymen claim ha Rao is a poor
man, and unable o pay a couny
license The comparison was made
wih he poor man rying o keep ou
of he poorhouse by peddling rinkes
on he sree Rao was held up as a
subjec of sympahy, unable o make
a liing excep by bumming on he
axpayers This is anyhing bu com
plimenary o Rao
The ruh is Rao is a young man,
single and ablebodied He pays a
ciy license for conducing his show in
Jackson— pays i because he ciy
auhoriies— unlike he couny mana
gers—insis upon his conribuing his
share for he goernmenal proecion
afforded him He is well able o pay,
because he has done a hriing busi
nessas good a busines as any one in
Jackson If he can pay here he can
pay he couny license for show
ing in Suer Creek also If he is no
doing a paying business here, why
no qui, and le some one else ry If
he is doing a paying business on he
ouside, he poery plea, miserable as
s, will no hold He is no dependen
upon he ouside show business, wih
is shirked license, for a liing, bu
upon he Jackson business, where he
has o pay a license The ruh is,
he basis of he free license is polii
cal, and nohing else

Before he nex issue of he Ledger, he elecion will hae

will affec hem financially and oherwise a eery sage of
affairs for he coming official erm The Ledger is no a hide
bound Republican paper We hae a arious imes declined
o suppor sae and couny candidaes, on high moral
or poliical grounds, bu neer from mere personal moies
We hae no sympahy wih ha blind parisanship ha

Of he new candidaes we hae firs of all, John S ais,

Grossly Misrepresens
Facs In Jackson
Las Saurday eening Jackson was
he scene of a democraic mass mee
ing, a which sae senaor,  Cami
nei, nominee for member of sae
senae from he 10h disric, and
Judge John E Raker, democraic
nominee for congress in he firs dis
ric, were he principal speakers
The Jackson band opened he mee
ing by playing seeral selecions, afer
which senaor Caminei was inro
duced from he seps of he Naional
hoel by r E E Endico, who
aced as chairman of he meeing
He seemed o hink eeryhing was
posiiely cerain as far as his own
elecion was concerned For his com
panion judge Raker, howeer, he was
less ceiain, and herefore empied his
gif of oraory upon he judge, who is
making a bier campaign himself
agains his opponen, congressman
Englebrigh  ;
Caminei, afer finding his oice
gone by reason of hoarseness, in
roduced judge Raker
Raker aemped o be cleer in his
opening remarks, by referring o his
own beauy, bu oned down o solid
argumen, and declared ha he was
going o be he nex congressman
from his disric in spie of all his
obsacles
The democras and he insurgen
republicans will be able o conrol he
house, he declared, and I shall, when
eer 1 find i consisen, sand by he
insurgen forces
He announced ha he opposed
personal abuse, and personal criicism
1 am making a dayligh, noonday figh
myself, and I will conduc his cam
paign unil he polls close on he Bh
of Noember along he same lines
He saed ha Englebrigh repeaed
ly oed agains labor, and decried and
aemped o belile he presen con
gressman in eery manner possible
Mr Raker confessed in his speech
ha nearly eery person in Humbold
couny informed him ha owing o
he successful work of Knglebrigh in
securing he appropriaion of oer a
million of dollars, which had o be ex
pended in repairing and improing he
harbor of Eureka ec, ha o a
jack man of hem, as he expressed i,
would oe o reurn Englebrigh for
ha ac alone Wih he aid of a
congressional record in which was
prined only he opening appropriaion
of $150,000, he claimed ha congress
man Englebrigh was misrepresening
he maer, and deceiing his enire
disric is he way he pus i Tha
he carried posiie proofs of wha he
was elling Then he exhibied he
copy of he congressional record and
read o his audience he appropriaion
which he saed before was bu $150,
000 which congress really passed upon
as he oal amoun for he work o
pu he harbor of Eureka in a nai
gable condiion
fer he meeing he Ledger's re
presenaie ineriewed he candidae
and showed him an ediorial published
in a prominen Neada couny paper,
saing ha oer one million dollars
has been recommended fer read
ing he ediorial, Raker urned o he
reporer and said, ' 'Well his paper is
misinformed, ha's all" He was
hen asked o deny or affirm he repor
as being an ediorial i was supposed
o carry wih i an air of ruhfulness
only  9K
Well hen, he'said, "I wish o in
form you ha Mr Englebrigh is de
ceiing eeryone ha he ells ha he
has secured he million dollar appro
priaion for Humbold couny, or any
promise for ha amoun, ha his only
appropriaion is $150,000 which in i
self is insufficien o ow ou and an
chor scows 'o sar he work, and
here is nohing whaeer on record
ha a any,, ime congress will eer
appropriae one more cen o carry on
he work
Then he picked up his dress sui case
and ook herefrom a large package of
papers and documens, which coered
he enire period of Mr Englebrigh's
experience in public life I exhibi
hese papers willingly he commened,
wheneer I mee a man who is willing
o be coninced    ;'
Saring a Englebrigh's
period as a public official, ;he ' pre
sened his record, declaring ha he
presen congressman had done nohing
commendable since his firs elecion,
and inimaing furher, ha he did
no hae he abiliies o qualify, for
he posiion he is holding
The only purpose was o prejudice
he republican candidae, if possible,
in he minds of some, and hereby
alienae oes, and help he democraic
candidae The scheme was raw, bu
he monumenal mendaciy of he
speaker saggered us We ook he
opporuniy o call up Congressman
Englebrigh by elephone when a
Sonora, and asked him abou some of
he saemens made by Raker, es
pecially he charge of deceiing he ]
people of Ilumbold couny by elling 
hem of a million dollar appropriaion,
when in fac only $150,0o0 was
graned Mr Englebrigh informed
us ha he engineers sen ou by he
goernmen o inesigae condiions,
repored o congress ha i would
ake 81,037,000 o make he improe
mens conemplaed On his basis
he sum of $150,000, was oed a he
las session as a sarer of his grea
work— he esimaed cos of one year's
work I is merely he beginning and
no he end of he maer, as he un
scrupulous Raker wished o make he
people beliee Oher appropriaions
will be made as needed
Judge Raker has been making he
same kind of shameless misrepresena
ions in oher places The Placer Re
publican akes him o ask seerely
for his low down acics I says 
Mr Raker saed ha his opponen
had deceied he people of Humbold
couny ino he belief ha he had
securei an appropriaion of 81,037,000
for harbor improemens a Eureka
and ha he (Raker) has "asounded"
he people of ha couny by proing
ha only $105,000 had been appro
priaed s a maer of fac Mr
Englebrigh in his speeches in Hum
bold couny and ineriews prined in
Eureka papers has fully expiuined his
maer He has qhown ha he has
obained an appropriaion of $150,000
o coer one year's work The plan!)
proiding for he improemen of he
bar call for an expendiure of $1,
037,000 and his will be aailable as
he work progresses The people of
Humbold couny will gie Mr Engle
brigii an oerwhelming majoriy

Jugde Raker informed his audience
ha Congressman Englebrigh had
done nohing for he mining indusry
of he sae He was chairman of he

In San Francisco In 1915 and they are
practically unanimous in favor of tho
proposition to tax the State and bond
San Francisco to add $10,000,000 to
tho Exposition fund.
The California State Orange, at its
meeting in Napa on October 6th,
adopted the following resolutions:
Whereas, There hns been submitted
to the people* of the State of Califor
nia two proposals for amendment to
the Constitution of the State; and
Whereas, '- -These measures, if ap
proved, will enable the people of San
Francisco to raise by taxation $5,000,
000 for the Panama-Pacific Interna
tional Exposition, and will provide
for a State tax adding another $5,000,
000 to the Exposition fund; and
Whereas, We, as farmers and pro
ducers, realize the vital necessity of
supporting and encouraging the efforts
of the men who are. bending every
energy to tho successful consumma
tion of the plan to place before the
world the wonderful resources of the
Pacific Coast; therefore, be it
Resolved. That we,' the members of
the California State Grange, do here
by express our belief that the best
interests of California will be served
by favoring these measures. We are
of the opinion that the effect of the
Panama-Pacific International Exposi
tion will be to larsely aid in the de
velopment of the State and her re
sources;
Resolved,* That a copy of this reso
lution be sent to each subordinate
Grange in the State, and to each In
dividual member;
Resolved, That the Secretary of
this organization be instructed to for
ward each subordinate Grange in Cal
ifornia such printed matter as will
call the attention of the people to the
Importance of these measures.
EDITORS FOR EXPOSITION TAX
Members of California Press Associa*
tion Will Work for Amendments.
The California Press Association
has unanimously and unqualifiedly
endorsed the San Francisco Panama-
Pacific Exposition project. Seventy
five members of the Association, all
prominent newspaper editors and
managers, held a three days' confer
ence in San Francisco October 7, 8
and 9, and after, a thorough discussion
of the subject, pledged themselves to
work for the passage of the two pro
posed constitutional amendments by
which $10,000,000 will be added to the
Exposition fund.
The resolutions adopted contain the
following paragraph having particular
reference to the State tax:
"This convention heartily endorses
the State tax on $5,000,000 to be de
voted to the funds of an International
Exposition to be held in San Francisco
in 1915."
ODD FELLOWS
ENDORSE EXPOSITION
The Grand Encampment, I. O. O. F.,
at its annual session at Santa Ana,
on October 7, unanimously adopted
the following resolution endorsing the
Panama-Pacific Exposition at San
Francisco in 1915:
Resolved, That the Grand Encamp
ment heartily endorses and approves
the holding of the Panama-Pacific Ex
position in California in 1915, and re
quests its members, individually and
collectively, to use their best efforts
and influence. in local, State and Na
tional matters that shall culminate in
assembling not only the people of our
own Republic, but the nations of the
world, in our Golden State at the
completion of this great enterprise.
AN ENORMOUS PLEDGE.
Commenting editorially on the ac
tion of the legislature in paving the
way to add $10,000,000 to the San
Francisco Panama-Pacific Exposition
fund the Healdaburg Enterprise says:
"It is recognized that the exposition
would be of great benefit to the whole
coast if only from an advertising point
of view. In order that the United
States government may take official
notice of the fair it is necessary that
these bonds be voted. This $10,000,
000 together with the $7,500,000 al
ready subscribed by San Francisco
will enable California to go to the
opening of the session and offer the
United States an enormous pledge
that it is able to finance and conduct
an exposition that will be a credit to
the nation."
THE LOGICAL PLACE.
That San Francisco is the logical
place to bold the world's fair In 1915
could not be denied by even the fair
eat minded people of New Orleans.
There Is no harbor to New Orleans;
It Is Inland 100 miles, on a river, but
no place to invite the navies of the
world, and that will be half a show of
Itself. It Is to celebrate the bringing
ocean to ocean together, and with the
finest harbor In tho world San Fran
cisco is eutitled to it. Let's boost

Changed Considerably
Previous to the time that Mr Bole
decided to become a candidate for
judge, no man in the county had more
to say in praise of Judge Wood. He
openly stated that he was able, impar
tial and courteous, and that the county
was to be congratulated upon his ap
pointment, and that he would be wil
ling to practice before him the re
mainder of his life. Mr Bole has had
no cases before Judge Wood since !he
became a candidate, and yet under
the guise of a communication from
Sutter Creek to promote his candi
dacy, he permits the publication of
an article reflecting upon the honor
and motives of Judge Wood for his de
cision in a case in which Mr Bole was
an attorney.-
An attorney who would endeavor to
elevate himself to the bench by taking
advantage of attacks upon the court
would certainly not elevate the court
by his occupacy of that bench.

John Biyggs Batchelder waa borrr tn
Raymond, Rockingham county, New
Hampshire, December 26, 18Z6. He
was engaged In farming in his native
state, until 1847, when he moved to
New Bedford, Mass., and there em
barked on a sailing vessel bound for
Australia by the Cape of Good Hope
route. He lived in Australia until the
latter part of 1849, when he was seized
with the gold fever which was then
sweeping around the world incident to
the discovery of gold in California. He
left for California, arriving in this
state in the spring of 1850. He joined
a United States expedition organized
in Monterey to subdue the Indians in
in the Four Creeks country, as it was
then called, and which is now com
prised in the counties of Kern and
Tulare. The expedition, after accom
plishing its object, crossed over the
mountains into the San Joaquin valley
to Benecia, and disbanded in the fall'
of the same year. After a few
months he started for Jackson, arriv
ing here in May, 1851, and proceeded
at once to Clinton, where lie followed
mining and vegetable raising until
1853, when he moved to a ranch one
mile east of Jackson, and engaged' in
farming up to the time of his death;
In 1865 he was united in marriage to
Mrs Maria Thompson, 'nee Eakin. One
son "and one daughter were born of
this union, both of whom survive ; J.
E. Batchelder of Jackson, and Mrs
Rose Dabadie of Altaville, Calaveras

Deafness Caa not 08 Cored
by local applications as they cannot

There is only one way to cure deafnees
and that Is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness is caused by an inflamed con
dition of the mucous "lining of the Eus
tachian Tube. When this tube is in
flamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can oe
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are paused by Catarrh, which is noth

mucous surfaces.
