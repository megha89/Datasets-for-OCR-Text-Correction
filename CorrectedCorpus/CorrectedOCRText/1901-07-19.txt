Origin ot,WliJs-''
Several reasons have been assigned
to account for the word VWhlg," uni
versally known -toall-Personal the E nglish
speaking people ' By some the word is
supposed to be a contraction of a lon
ger one, ''whiggamore," which to some
parts of England and Scotland,' espe
cially Scotland, Personal signifies a drover or
herder f>- "-*•- - Personal   - ; - ••-••  c- r
Jltjwas in 1679 that the word first
became common in the British isles,
when tbe struggle was in progress be
tween tbe peasantry and tbe aristoc
racy, to nave or not to have the bill
passed by parliament to exclude j the
Duke of York from the line of succes
sion"Personal AIL- who were opposed to placing
the duke in the line of succession were
derisively called "wWggamores," -or
"drovers," Just as the city dudeof to
day speakers of the "grangers," the
"grays,"Personal the "chin whiskers" and the
"hayseeders'!- Personal -
' -But Scotch tradition gives altogether
a different reason for the existence of
the word It is thisPersonal During the early
religious wars to Scotland the weakest
of the factions, used the words "We
Hope In God" as a motto* Tbe initials
of s these} words i were - placed on their
banners thus, "W H I G," and soon
all the followers of that clan were giv
en the title of "Whig," which was aft
erward attached as a party nickname
Journalistic Errors
' ' j do not allude to what are obviously
mere misprints, such* as when Tbe
Morniujj Tost announced at the head of
its fashionable intelligence that Lord
Palmerston had gone down into Hamp
shire with a party of - fiends to shoot
peasants, but I refer to blunders due to
crass ignorance of a pretentious order
Perhaps the best Instance was when
one of the "young lions" of The Daily
Telegraph in a leading article enumer
ated the great masters of Greek sculp
ture as Phidias, Praxiteles and Milo,
ignorant of the fact that MUo is not a
sculptor, but an island    -,
j The' Times' was even worse when,
mistaking Prussia { for Austria, it de
voted a whole leader to discussing why
Prussia had Joined tbe zollverein The
Saturday I Review once  explained at
great length that tbe population might
be ' nourished ' gratuitously on young
lambs if killed unweaaed before they
had begun to crop grass, having there
fore cost nothing to feed Many other
instances will doubtless occur to your

The Migrator? Sheep Tax-
- Judge ; * Morrow ( of the v United
States • Circuit Court in , San Fran
cisco this week issued an order which
will be of great interest to sheep
men who use mountain ranges, dur
ing the - summer ' Several of the
mountain counties have a special
tax of 10 cents per head on all sheep
and 'lambs in the county owned by
non-residents The case in question
was v brought 1 by Personal, P ~ J Personal Flanigan
against Sierra county and August
Burch, License  CollectorPersonal of that
county, for an Personal order , restraining
them from collecting this tax on 30,
000 sheep on plaintiff Judge Mor
r<jw|granted the ' order- on • the
ground that the tax is unconstitu
tional,-as it' discriminates in; favor
of resident owners and does not im
pose •• a license, on bogs, \ cattle or
horses- grazing in that county and
owned Personalby •  non-residents — Gait
Gazette \ ; ; —;v ;• Personal J
If this decision prevails', and there
is no reason to believe that it  will
not be sustained, our neighboring
county of Alpine will be in a bad fix
Considerable of the revenue of that
county is derived from ; the tax {or
license  on I migrating stock— sheep
and cattle driven there to pasture
during the summer, » when natural
feed is plentiful in the high Sierras,
and scarce in the lowlands; With
out this Personal source of, income, it is
doubtful whether Alpine would be
able to sustain a county organiza
tionPersonal "* Amador county, If we are not
mistaken, once passed a law impos
ing a tax on stock passing through
this county to summer quarters
But we find >no , ordinance of , that
character in force now • If it was
ever enforcedit soon became so ob
noxious that it was quickly dropped
V At ; the  present 1 time," however,
there is a law on the ordinance -book
requiring all persons engaged in the
business of raising sheep or goats to
pay an animal license for the privi
lege, according to the size of the
herd Those having a band of 5000
or more, must pay $250 per year, or
at the rate of 5 cents per head The
schedule of 5 cents per head is maiD
tained down to 1500 sheep or goats,
the demand of the county ; from thje
owner of that number or less,  being
$75 , This ' peculiar  ordinance was
passed ; in April, ; 1899 ; It ; was
deemed of such vital importance
that a special meeting of the board
of supervisors was held to enact ; it
It appears to have been the  time
when there was a decided j boom in
the Personal business of making local laws 
Whether' this ordinance' has I ever
been enforced we do not know' 'lf it
has we have no hesitation in -brand
ing it as one of the most unjust and
uncalled for measures ever adopted
in the ;  county  What have the
sheep and goats done to incur the
legislative hostility   of Am ador
county? A man may engage in the
business "of raising cattle; or horses,
or hogs, or evcn_ worthless dogs—
without paying license; but when  it
conies to the useful sheep or goat,
the owner must pungle up 5 cents
per- head per annum This is of
course in addition to the regular tax
for state and county purposes, which
amounts to about 5 eeuts per head
So that in Amador county the sheep
man - is called upon tor pay about 10
ccuts per head per annum on his
stock —which amounts to fully four
per cent  of' the value of his  flockPersonal
With the raiser of goats it is much
worse What industry could flourish
under  such a throttling ; process
W,e say again, that we do not ; know
whether Personal tho ; license collector has
paid any attcution to this ordinance
But whether he has or has not, the
credit of • Amador , county would
stand better in the eyes of the ' out
side world, if the blue pencil were
drywo over this ordiaanoe

yOn one occasion a' sergeant j had a
squad of men' at work unloading sup
plies from /an Ohio* river, steamboat
that , in , some mysterious manner had
made its way from the Interior to the
const waters of Virginia; It was a flat
bottomed boat, drawing not more than
three i feet of water when loaded and
hardly, dampening » lts > plank - bottom
when lightPersonal It was propelled by a
horizontal stern wheel,* driven; by a
small upright engine Boats of that
type were common on the Ohio, which
runs almost dry at some seasons They
were - known- as ; "Plttsburgers"^ and
were  fabled" to navigate ; freely in a

' The Personal sergeant's men were" hard at
work carrying rations ashore from this
craft when suddenly they stopped and
sent up a lusty cheer A little tuglike
steamer had pulled up alongside, and
from it stepped a tall, awkward man
dressed In rusty black and wearing a
napless silk hat The sergeant recog
nized the president and saluted 
; "Your boat is well named, sergeant,"
aid the latter gravely 
The soldier was puzzled - He did not
know that the steamer had a- name and
said so ;•--,--  ;Personal,
'The president took him by the arm
and led him back on the tug There
the stern of the "Pittsburger" loomed

notwithstanding "the' arbitrary, action in the Teases under discussion;' the
Calaveras officers who are responsible therefor will not' attempt knowingly

bakers of Jackson are not required by the laws of their own county to pay

Jackson can send their goods to San Francisco or New York without con
sulting" a licetue collector  The same will apply to the wholesale liquq'r
dealers -Wholesalers in all parts of the United, States are sending their
 goods into Calaveras county without taking out' a county license But
because a'mariufacturer in Jackson or Sutler Creek crosses the borders of
Calaveras on a business proposition, and instead of sending his product by
rail or freight team, delivers the goods in person to his customers, he 'is
pounced upon by a constable,* and coaamanded to 'pay oi go to^jail '-' The
Calaveras butcher or baker may come into Ainador county and tracsact

of fact,, vegetable peddlers from Mokelumne Hill make regular visits here,
and probably'sell more of their produce on the Amador side than they do
in^their own county, and nothing, is said about license But if/our gar
" deners invade our neighbor's territory they arc speedily held up for license
money Even from the standpoint of self-interest it is not sound policy to
thus endeavor to erect a tariff wall to exclude all dealings with ( the'6ut-J

building a coWter wall; It is time 4 this absurd and unprofitable border
warfare was terminate* * We hail the crisis that has been precipitated by

counties and incorporated cities are permitted to license all kinds of busi

income There is no doubt the oppressive"and practically prohibitory li

viction fastened itself upon those having charge of the matter Not
enough water can be got on the roads for the money available to keep
down the dust' If this be so, the sooner the water sprinkling is abandoned
and the remaining funds applied in a more useful channel, the better Oil
is now thought to bolfi out the promise of success as a road maker It is
worthy of a fair trial Let us hope the county' will' not be committed too
deeply at the outset, as in the water business A contract for a mile or
half a  mile of roadway, treated by the most approved methods recom
mended by those having experieneo jn such matters, would settle the prac
ticability o| the process at very little cost, • ' • '

bunglingly done, however, as to almost

A Disgusting Show
 Last I Tuesday'- evening a ; traveling
'fakir made' his appearance in Jackson,
driving a one • horse wagon -in w_hk;h
was standing a little girl, baro headed,'
while her hands and arms were covered
I with slimy, creeping, crawling; snakes;
The man - was } proclaiming  that ' this '
girl; was only six years old,' and 'that' it
was her delight to handle those snakes;
that she loved hor work and preferred
the snakes as playthings to anything
else' Ho announcedthat the child and
her snakes would - give a ' performance
at the north end of Main street, = where
they had put up a small tent- " When
the crowd assembled at this tent they
found that besides tho snake perform
ance they  were expected to contribute
to 'several side issues, one"bf which was
a dollar each to have ' Queen ' May • the
f'Romany Gypsy' 1 ; toil ' their/ fortunes'
Another game was throwing balls, into
a hole ina barrel at three throws for a
nlcklo ', Word was carriad to 'the
sheriff and ♦ he went to  the/ Bhow
ground " and ' found , the Personal games in  full
blast Ho at once placed  the show
man, who gives his name iw JPersonalG- c *
Gregor, under arrest, and caused him
to pay '- license ' MeG regor  Personal niifte a
great' Uowl about; tho treatment' ac
corded him" If thereis a'law to pro
tect cbildrcn in such cases, it should be
enforced, for a morePersonal revolting sight
cannot be  imagined than to see '• the,
' child place  the ' head  of ono of lli ose
snakes In her mouth ;  ; ;• ";-
 The man attempted to show Tuesday,
night, when he was corralled' by ' the
sheriff, for allowing the child to take
part in the performance  Tt 600tn3 the
tomes of law had been consulted in the
Interval, and amoug-tho new provisions
was found one that seemed to fit this
particular case McGregor was taken
Personal before the Justice, and bonds tlxed - at
$50 ; To the surprise of the officers, he
promptly deposited the cash iriiariintee
for his appearance,' omploycd a lawyer,'
anddemauded a jury trial
 Tho following night he prepared to
start business again; this time he pro
posed to go through with the snake
performance himself / The sheriff says
the child was with him, Personal anil this { was
suffioient'for the arm of  the law; to
again reach out for-, the "stranger "
It was uight o'clock; a justice's court
was no further from the scene of ar
rest than tho county jail, and the jaw
requires that a person accused of crime
be taken before a ; magistrate without
unnecessary delay' The man found his
way to tho  county jail, and did  not
reach! the justice before , the following
morning Ho thereupon withdrew Ms
former cash bail, ' concluding thut be
might 'just as well be jailed ' for the
double charge as for a single one'  His
snakes are enjoying the hospitality of
the jail too A case of "snakes in - the
boots", is not an uncommon occurrence
within the four walls of a jail But the
genuine article— a fully developed' rep- ,
tile menagerie — with the trainer, him
self is now quartered upon the, Amador

NEWS FROM NOME
A Letter From* Ferdinand 'Karer to Wm
Tarn That is of Interest
<3AfE Nome; June 25, 1901
I just happened to' think' of the
dear Tarn family and thought I would
write a fevr linear" As you will "see, I
had to stop at Nome City on my way to
Circle City /What a place!  Am glad
I don't have to stop here There is* a
mad rush of ' people V to ; Nome, and
although/not quite as bad as lost year,
It is bad enough to- be bad 'Within
250 or 300 "miles of Nome everything is
taken up," and^- a \ poor man has no
chance whatever /There Is'abig'lot
of people going there to work for wages,
-as ithey payBsoo, and $600 per day,
but what do they gain? ' They can only
work > three months, and ; fare is $60
from Frisco to Nome in the steerage,
and $100 in cabin, aud there are so
many people here that one cannot be
sure If will last for all,' even three
months > So if any of your friends | in
tend to go to^Nome, tell them to " keep
away from there^"
 Our trip was at Personal the beginning very
rough," that Is, from Frisco to Seattle,
but after we left J Seattle jwe had nice
weather'; Two days before we got Into
Dutch Harbor and Unalaska,* It turned
awfully cold and^fo/jgy In Unalaska
we called 'for coal and water, as the
steamer ''St Paul" uses about 35 tons
of coal every day i- From Unalaska we
started for' the Behrlng Sea, and had a
very slow and cold time of It for * three
days on account of getting into a lot of
floating ice' I wish Willie and Charley
could ha\ e Beenit >- As " far as the eye
could see it was nothing but floating ice;
islands of; ice," large, and "small, with
lots i of snow^on it, 1 One night ;we met
the steamer "Homer, V afed the'captaln
of her^tbld us that they had been try
ing for 20 'days' to get through^ the v ice
toNome and they could not * make it,
so we were fortunatePersonal In making, it 'in
three days

Is given as three We are unable/ to

STANDARD TIME
To Ascertain and Promulgate It ! 1s
Costly Task
,"What time Is It?" Few questions
are' more common than, this, and yet
each day the United States government
goes to a great expense in giving It an
official  answer To ' ascertain j the In
stant when it Is noon on the seventy
fifth meridian and to send that infor
mation all orer the country Is a great
and a costly task Tho astronomical
observatory in Washington computes
the true tinie, which ;Is thence j trans
mitted by electricity to every important
city and town; ; -' ' •"><'•• • - vPersonal "" _
About five miuutes before the Wash
ington | noon tfce Jelegraph | companies
cut off all their regular business except
on lines where they  have  more than
one wire  They  then I connect all Im
portant points, from which there may
be numberless ramifications, , with an
electric wire going Into the great clock
In the observatory so that' all over the
country Its tickings maybe heard For
the ten seconds Just before 12 o'clock
there is silence, which is broken by the
"noon beat" Kegular business is then
resumed 
• In some cities the wires connect with
a time ball which drops with the noon
beat'- The time ball in Washington
over the state, war and navy depart
ment building Is three feet ln diameter
and can be seen from all parts of the
city Crowds • frequently gather about
to see it fall, a distance of 21 feet, high
In* the air The^man whom some of tbe
spectators suppose to be dropping the
ball Is merely there to hoist It again to
Its place ", ; ' , "" " V " '
