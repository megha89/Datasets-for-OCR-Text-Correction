be difficuly of inerpreing be

socalied olcanoes of be moon can
no, he hinks, be due o he causes
which hae produced hose of be

for example, is difficul o explain on

and is inolosod by walls hree miles
bigb When his is compared wih
be aerage size of he erresrial
olcano, and when a remembered
ha he earh is fify imes us large
as he moon, he difficuly of ao
couning for lunar "olcanoes" by
forces similar o hose which hae
produced be olcanoes of he earh
is apparen nd ba he moou,
alhough so much smaller han be
earh, should hae mounain peaks
rising o greaer heighs han hose of
he Himalayas is anoher difficuly
To accoun, hen, for he known

be money hey draw monh afer

If s a salary i he sric sense of

Bu i may be asked, wha differ

or be salary fund? We reply ha i
makes a ery maerial difference, and
he axpayers of he enire couny are
ially ineresed in mainaining be

for he salary fund Tha fund is
made up from he curren expense

picure of he old Ialy and he new

diner "He is really more han life

Her aun, Mrs Hammell, swung
around sharply
"Who? Oh, ha guard? I is his hel
me, my dear child, aud his high heeled
boos Wouldn' you hiuk he'd be
ashamed o pose like ha a he head
of he grand saircase? id you eer
see so much gil braid aud shiny leah
er on one human being?"
Mrs Hamniell's oice had execued
a gradual crescendo, and Teuelope
reached forh a proesing hand
"on' speak so loud, aunie, dear
He migh undersand"
Bu he grea, square shouldered fig

inued o criicise he king's guard
"Tha's jus he difference beween

Eery one of our lads holds possibili

Penelope replied wih conicionPersonal
"I don' agree wih you Tha man

will some day do hings ha are worh

Mrs Hammell gasped and closed her

"My dear Penelope, I am amazed! If

how will you feel by he ime we hae
aended a few recepions and me he

"Thoroughly disgused, I presume,"
said Penelope coldly, "and I hope we
shall no go o any recepions where
iny men, wih waxed musaches and
mincing seps, will look hrough my
backbone o daddy's newly acquired
bank accoun I is because ha man
is so big, so srong and looks as if he

o," ended Penelope, wih a sigh for
her fie fee eleen Inches of graceful
slenderness "I was considering him
only as an absrac quaniy, a hypo
heical man, so o speak"
"I should hope so," was her aun's
Indignan reply "Why, hese special
guards of he king are gahered in he
norh of Ialy solely for heir heigh,
he guidebook says, and no doub he
was found grubbing in some wreched
farm or ineyard In New York he
would be working in he subway"

Gobelin apesry had no moed he

Penelope paused, frozen in her racks,

She crossed o he window, resing her

The sunligh waned, and Penelope
knew ha ou on he ppian way en
der amehys shadows were seling
Why could no her aun be saisfied
wih Rome's beauiful oudoor life, is

aside her work "I am going, and

Penelope could say such hings wih
