ESERTING BRYN
While some democraic papers, banking more upon he
pary name and organizaion han upon any fixed principles
represened hereby, are sriing o make ligh of he fac,
here is no doub a serious /defecion of oldline democras
from he sandard of Bryauism ,The deserers include men
of characer and inellec who hae hereofore sood high in
he councils of he pary, and whose opinions hae been
gien due weigh by heir poliical conferees M S Tarpey
of his sae is a fair ype<df rhese< deserers They are o be
found in eery sae in he Union In one sae wo persons
nominaed on he Bryan elecoral icke hae sepped down
and ou because of heir iinabiliy o keep sep o he many
"isms" of Bryan Of course, he officeholding and office
seeking class profess o swallow he hodgepodge suff dished
up for hem by he man from Nebraska as a pary plaform
They do so from moies of sdf+ineres, alhough eer and
anon one possessed of more moral; courage han he aerage
raises he oice of proes, and|announces his repudiaion of
Bryan democracy The Ibolers are denounced by he bread
andbuer wing as weakkneed, wobbling democras, wheieas
in ruh hey consiue he bone and sinew and life blood of
he pary They are disgused ;a he Bryanie acics of
rying o pach up a plaform wih fheidea of caching eery
bunch of sray oes in he counry The reaching ou o
accomplish he impossible — namely o frame a declaraion of
pary principles ha will sui eery indiidual — is a perilous
underaking I is generally as effecie in scaering as in
aracing oes So Bryan is fmdingou in his campaign
as he did in his wo preious campaigns Salwar democras
•don' know wha o make of his assaul upon he cours in
he aniinjuncion plank; financiers are scary of his plan of
he guaranee of priae deposiors in ibanlks by he naional
goernmen ; manufacurers are afraid of his proposed
mehods of ariff reision nd so prominen cases of de
fecion are cropping up all around, and his longnursed
hopes of being he chief magisrae of he naion are fading
away for he hird and las ime In Bryan's firs campaign
Clelelandhe foremos democra and presiden of he Unied
Saes was agains him on his free siler plaform iHe was
roundly abused by he same crowd ha hold pary fealy
aboe eeryhing else; bu oday his memory is honored by
men of all poliical creeds for he lofy parioism Ihe mani
fesed on ha occasion Bryan's iews oday, shifed some
wha s rue from he poliical gospel jhe preached wele
years ago, are jus as isionary and inimical o he pros
periy of he counry as hey were in 1896 People fiock o
hear him now as hey did hen The music of his oice is
sill poen o charm hem; bu as fhead of his naion hey
wan none of his kind, They prefer he wellbeaen pahs of
republisau rule, which has neer failed o bring abou pros
periy
The capial remoal quesion is scarcely heard of in his
campaign I made a grea furore when he bill auhorizing
is submission o a oe of he people was before he legisla
ure The scheme seems o hae died a is birh  any
rae s a dead issue now The goernor is no required by
he ac o include he issue in his elecion proclamaion I
will doubless ge on he ballo in some way, and be oed
down oerwhelmingly
The cones for superisor i he fourh disric is warm"
jug up  Fraser, incumben and democraic candidae for

is equally hard a work o displace him, wih srong hopes
of success Surely he axpayers arc anxious for a change
in he board, a change in road managemen, and he upse

into error aud lend an atom to tbe
gl-oridcation of the idea tbat tbis
country should be governed by the
hands of tbe few— the rioh--not tbe
sinew and hone. In tbis land— tbe
homo of tbe free aud the brave— it
does not become any man to become
so egotistical as to proclaim Himself
a tryant, when it is taken into con
sideration tbat ancestors of tbe author
of the same were exiles and only
came to thin country to escape what
he now would inflict upon others.
The Austrlans, as a lßoe,' are con
structive, not destructive, and if
given a tair opportunity prove them
selves the equal of tbe Dutch or the
proverbial Jew in accumulation of
homos and worldly goods. And even
when, by early environments, they
were deprived of an education, their
first throught is to eduoate their
children iv the language of their
adopted cmintry.
The term "dog eaters" belongs to
tbe class of tho Prosjdont's Ananias
Club aud its appellation doos not
concern us, as we come from a
country of less dogs ana more intelli
gence. In tbe same category might
bo termed the word "Dago," as
applied to Italians. Instead of being
a term of reproach, my friend, Mr.
Day, it is a badge of honor, coming
down as it does for ages, from the
Doges of Venice and Genoa, tbe latter
city the home of Columbus, tbe dis
coverer of America.
You may tbink, Mr. Day, tbat we
are' an illiterate class of people, but
we beg leave to suggest tbat the
annals of history will show that
Austria has produced some of the
most illustrious men and women tbat
have ever appeared upon tbe world's
stage. Among which may be men
tioned tbe ill-fated Marie Antoinette
and Charlotte, tbe latter' the wits of
tbe misguided Maximilian, not to
speak of tbe second wife of Napoleon
the first. In tbe meantime do not
forget Kossutb, the patriot, who
came to tbis country shortly atter tbe
Civil War and by his eloquence and
patriotism aided tbe cause of liberty
in his country to tbe extent of over
$200,000. Any student ot history in
the diplomatic line will remember
the tilts between tbe two greatest
diplomats of their time— Talleyrand
for France and Metternicb — tor
Aapoloon'H aids was worsted iv more
than one bout in regard to changing
tbe map ot Europe, lint wby ex
patiate upon which everybody knows;
but while on tbis subject it might be
well to merely mention the fuct Hint
wheu you are'iu a city of pretentious,
your restaurant meals are invariably
ensooused with Hungarian music.
For wealth aud touch ot scenery,
artistic taste, art, literature, states
manship and general worthiness, as
a class, the Austrian race stands
amongst the fore. Justice.

Wisdom Air. Taft's Strong Point.
There is a degree of inflexibility
about Mr Taft when be is right, nnd
he knows he ia right, and when the
other man is wrong and inclined to
be Rggressire about ft, that is apt to
surprise thoee who seek to take nd
rnntnge of his boundless good nature,
lln believes in discipline and ho
knows bow to enforce it. When be
was Diet placed in charge of tbe
Panama Canal he received a delega
tion of steam ebovelere who wanted
more pay. They deserved it, and Mr
Tuft favored giving it to them if
possible, but they committed a mis
take. They went at It the wrong way.
J'heir attitude was not conciliatory,
and Dually the spokesman said:
"We'll strike light away If you
ilnnt' agree to give us this* mine "
"Let me understand tbis oorreot
ly," said Mr Taft. "Da you mean
to Hiiy Hint you will strike now; that
you want that raise before I have had
a chance to go into tlia merits of
your claim nnrl deaide, and tbat you
will strike if you don't get it to-day"
"That's light, 1 ' was the retort.
■"Thank you," said Mr TaJt. "Ihon,
gentlemen, will you kindly step out
to hit secretary and hand him your
resignations."
The men retreated. They didn't
want to resign and they didn't, and
finally the matter was adjusted on a
buais which all agreed was just aud
proper.
Cold Weather Advice

colds on the chest; as neglected they
readily lead to pneumonia, consump
tion or other pulmonary troubles.

savago thing to bca£ a weary or- starved
man because he lagged in his work. So
in trooping the lagging, torpid liver lit; is
a great mistake to lash it with, strong
drastic drugs. A torpid liver is but an
indication of an ill-nourished, enfeebled
body whose organs aro weary with over
work. Start with tho stomach and allied
organs of digestion and nutrition. Put
them in . working order and see how
quickly your liver will become active.

stores tho normal activity of the stomach,
Increases the socretions of the blood-mak-

sonous accumulations, and so relieves the
liver of the burdens imposed upon ft by
the defection of other organs.
