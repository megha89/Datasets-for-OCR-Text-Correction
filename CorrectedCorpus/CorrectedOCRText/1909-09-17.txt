and heir claim o he same is based
upon a noice o locaion daed and
posed upon he ground on ug 28,
1908, upon which day hey disincly
marked heir locaion upon he ground
so ha is boundaries could be readily
raced Plainiffs enry upon he land
or he purpose of making he locaion
was peaceably made, bu since hen hey
hae neer had acual possession of any
par of he claim, nor hae hey per
formed any labor upon i r
, efendans hae disclaimed any in
eres o he mos weserly en acres of
he rac alleged by plainiffs o be
owned by hem bu by way of a cross
complain hey asser ile o he re
maining weny acres upon he groundsPersonal
1 Tha hey hae held and worked
he ground for more han fie years pre
ceeding he conmencemen of his ac
iion, and hae hereby acquired ile
wihou a locaion 2 Tha hey are
granees o one J B Skinner, who
made a alid locaion of he weny
acres as a placer claim on July 8, 1898,
noice of which locaion was recorded
July 27, 1896, wih he recorder of Vol
cano mining disric
The eidence gien upon he rial
showed wihou conflic ha his mining
ground was coered wihh a laa cap ha
was deep in some places; ha here
is suposeed o be an ancien channel
conaining goldbearing grael under
wha is known as Humbug gulch ; ha
his claim eners he weny acres in
dispue near he souhweserly corner,
and running in a norheaserly course
i passes ou of he weny acres a abou
midway in he easern line, and many
years ago a discoery shaf was sunk
in he gulch a a poin abou equidis
an in is course, from is poin of en
rance o is poin of deparure in he
weny acre claim This shaf was sunk
apparenly o a deph of abou hiry
fee, and grael was reached, wheher
gold bearing or no does no appear, bu
i was shown ha on accoun of he
waer encounered he mos pracical way
of workinghe grael was by' means
of a unnel sared from adjoining
ground
Skinner, afer making his locaion,
spen wo or hree days in making • sur
eys for he purpose of selecing a
course for a unnel o deelop he claim
He seled upon a poin and sared his
unnel upon paened land abou 500
fee eas from he easern, boundary of
he weny acre claim There was ei
dence a he rial showing ha work
was hereafer performed in driing he
unnel forward oward he shaf each and
eeryyear up o ugus 20, 1902, he
dae upon which defendans claim o
hae acquired ownership, bu i canno be
said ha he eidence proes he ex
pendiure of hs $100 worh of labor re
quired for eery one of hese years
On ec 28, 1896, Skinner coneyed
a onehalf ineres in he claim o M
Chrisensen, and on ugus 7, 1900, M
Chrisensen filed wih he couny re
corder his affidai showing ha he
had performed he annual labor for 1896
and 1899, upon he weny acre claim
and ha Skinner had failed o cronrib
ue his porion of such expense afer
demand by publicaion
Since ugus 20, 1902, defendans
claiming ownership of he weny acres
in dispue hae expended more han
$100 each year in driing he unnel for
ward, besides many hundreds of dollars
in running drifs, and before he rial
of his acion hey had by means of he
unnel peneraed under he surface of
he ery ground in dispue, bu he ei
dence does no esablish he disance, if
any, ha defendans had peneraed under
his weny acre claim a he ime of he
commencemen of his acion No
work of any kind has eer been per
formed by defendans or by Skinner or
his granees or assigns upon he surface

' Plainiffs conend ha as here has

Kearney, 33 Pac Rep 373, "where

lex Biown, chairman of he sae board of equalizaion,
in a conersaion wih San Joaquin people, is repored o
hae saed, for he purpose of reconciling hem o he
boes gien o he assessmen roll of ha couny by he sae
equalizers, ha he couny would gain raher han 'lose by
he raise — meaning of course ha he aggregae lif of assess
men rolls hroughou he sae, aud he reduced sae ley
based hereon, would more han compensae, so far as San
Joaquin is concerned, for he lower assessmen roll and he
higher sae ley ha would hae been ineiable had he
board of equalizaion aken no , acion In enlarging upon
he subjec he said he belieed in a high assessmen and a
low ax rae, raher hau a low assessmen aud a high ax
rae In mos of he counies of California he ax rae was
close up o he danger poin The idea was coneyed ha a
cerain amoun had o be raised o suppor Che local goern
men, and i made no real difference o he propery holder
wheher he paid $2 ax on $100 assessed aluaion, or $1
per $100 on a $200 aluaion, while he las named proposi
ion looked much he more iniing o he inending seler
This process of reasoning is sound enough in heory, bu is
no borne ou by acual pracice I suis he exigencies of
he sae goernmen jus now More money was needed o
lubricae he machinery Two ways were open o ge i
One was o clap on a heaier ax rae, which would fall upon
eery axpayer The oher was o boos he assessmen i
ceraiu lowlised counies, which would place he burden
upon he propery holders in he uplifed counies The
laer was considered he preferable roue Now he adice is
handed ou ha if all couny assessors would bring up heir
propery o a closer approximaion o "acual cash alue,''
a lower ax rae^for boh sae and couny purposes would be
he resul, and he enderfoo immigran would no be scared
a he prospec of he excessie demands for goernmenal
expenses Howeer plausible he plan may appear o he
uuiniiaed Mr Brown ough o know ha in pracice i has
proen ery disappoining I has been ried in mador
couny more han once, aud each ime he people hae been
called upon o pay increased axes Our presen couny as
sessor made a general arbirary increase of assessed alua
ions, being promped hereo, in a measure a leas, by he
expecaion ha a corresponding reducion would be made in
he ax rae Bu he decreased rae neer maerialized, and
he aerage axpayer had o conribue o he public reasury
a larger sum han before The ruh is, local goernmen
expenses, like hose of he sae iusiuion, hae been in
creasing by leaps and bounds a a much faser gai han he
acual increase of propery alues The couny managers
are anxious for pary reasons o aoid he displeasure aach
ing o raising he ax ley Bu a padded assessmen roll or
a drop of a few cens in he sae rae, furnishes he oppor
uniy o swell he reasury wihou increasing he rae per
$100 ud such opporuniies are rarely allowed o go by
defaul In mador couny in years gone by we hae mau
aged o ge along fully as well as we do now on a lower ax
rae wih an assessmen roll fully wenyfie per cen less
han a presen No doub mador couny is no an excep
ion in his respec Similar experience has been me wih
all along he line Eery arbirary boos of assessmen
aluaions esablishes a new basis for geing more money
for local purposes wihou incurring he odium of swelling
he ax rae I is probably his feaure of he siuaion ha
sirs he ire of he people in he souhern par of he sae,
where he assessmen booss hae been chiefly made They
know he sophisry of he argumen ha a big propery roll
means a proporionae lowering of he ax rae
The souhern par of he sae is seriously discussiug he
quesion of secessiou Mass meeings are being held o foser
he new sae moemen The people are horoughly worked
up oer he slap admiuisered by he sae board of equaliza
ion in raising heir assessmens The soreness oer ha

no offer much relief I was anyhing bu a poliic moe —

of winesses a he rial showing ha
he weny acres in dispue was known
as 'The Cleeland Consolidaed Placer
Mine
Winesses for plainiffs howeer esi
fied ha he propery was known as »he
'Eckar Claim', while one said i was
known as he 'Chrisensen and Skinner
diggings' There was no eidene ha
defendans granor Chrisensen eer re
ferred o he propery in conroersy as
'The Cleeland Consoildaed Placer
line', bu here was documenary
eidence ha he referred o his mining
claims by ha name He filed proof of
annual labor upon he 'Cleeland Con
solidaed Placer Mine, for he years
1898, 1899 1900, and 1901 In his proof
for 1898, he includes 'in he Cleeland
Consolidaed Placer Mine' 1500 acres
of land, bu only en acres of he weny
acres here in conroersy In he year
1899, he described he same 150 acres
In 19C0 he included he whole' weny
acres wih fify acres of oher lands
while in his proof for 1901, made abou
eigh monhs before he execuion of his
deed o defendans he described he
Cleeland Consolidaed Placer Mine as
being weny acres in he souh eas
quarer of he secion, he same er
roneous descripion by legal subdi
isions as conained in his deed
I will hus be seen ha here is no
eidence ha Chrisensen eer mdi
caed ha he boundaries of he Clee
land Consolidaed Placer Mine were co
exensie wih he propery in^dispue,
and i follows ha defendans can^ no
connec hemseles wih he Skinner
locaion, wihou a correced deed from
Chrisensen or an acion for he re
formaion of he same
sfendans claim ha nowihsanding
he erroneous descripion in he Chris
ensen deed hey hae proed a ile by
aderse possession for fie years,
because hey based heir claims o he
weny acres under he Chrisensen
deed, and ha for more han fie years
preceding he commencemen of hs
acion hey hae performed he necessary
annual labor each year in deeloping
he claim by driing he unnel forward,
which by hem s conended consi
ues possession under he law as de
clared in English s Johnson, 17" Cal
109 I was here said Personal
The aking up of mineral and in pur
suance of he mining regulaions of he
icinage gies possessory ife o he
claim jus as an enry in he land office
 bu i does no follow, be
cause his is he regular and usual way
of obaining possession, ha a posses
sion no so obained would necessarily
be wihou he proecion of he law
In mining claims we require no oher
acs, as eidence of possession, han
hose usually exercised by he owner of
such claims    Going on he lead o
work i, or een done in proximiy and
in direc relaion o he claim, for he
purpose of exracing, or preparing o
exrac minerals from i, as for example
saring a unnel considerable disance
off o run ino he claim would be a
possession of he claim wihin he
meaning of he rule
I appears ha he boundaries of he
mining claim menioned in English s
Johnson, were marked ou by a small
dich such as  mines usually made o
designae heir lines, which dich could
be easily raced, and ha he plainiffs
pu up noices, on he ground of wha
hey claimed While in he presen
case he esimony showed ha a he
ime of he rial he weny acres was
enclosed by a fence and saked a he
corners, bu he eidence for he plain
iff showed ha all he ime hey
posed heir own noice of locaion
here was no fence, no eidence o in
dicae he boundaries and only a sake
or mommen a one corner of he' claim
The case of English s Johnson was
cied in he subsequen case of Hess
s Winder, 30 Cal 350, and in ha
case he plainiff claimed as do defend
ans in his conroersy ha heir pos
session of he enire claim was good
wihou a locaion, ba he cour Jheld
ha he claim was desiue of mom
meris necessary o indicae he rac of
land claimed or o adise he mos igi
lan obserer of he possession claimed,
and a page 375 of he decision, s
sardPersonal
" Tha he boundarlca of he land
claimed for mining purposes mus be
indicaed by such disinc physical
marks or monumens as will fairly ader
ise o all concerned where and wha i
is, or In oher words is exen lso
in he Hess s Winder case as here,
he paries claimed ha as hey were in
acual possession of a porion of he
land and claiming under a deed hey
were consruciely In possession of
he whole, een hough such deed did
no sufficienly Indicae he boundaries,
bu he ccur disposed of he conenion
in his languagePersonal
"If he deed conains no deflnic and
cerain boundaries which can be loca
ed, marked ou, and made known, i
can no hae he effec o exend he
possession beyond he possessio
pedis which \is definie, posiie
and noorious The deed in
quesion does no conain a descripion
which could aid o exend he plain
iffs possession by consrucion"
In he caae of Gregory s Persh
baker, repored in 73 ' Cal Repors,
page 110 e seq, he inerenor haing
made a locaion which was found o be
subsequen o ha of plainiff, sough
o hold possession of he claim by
reason of work done in consrucing a
unnel hereunder, bu he cour in de
ciding agains him saidPersonal
"s o any claim o he possession
(of he mining claim) based on occu
pancy by he unnel under a porion of
plainiff's locaion such occupancy, if i
could be considered a al under he
saues would exend oniy o he space
wihin he walls" of he unnel, and
could no be exended beyond hem by
any rule of consrucie possession^
here was eidence on h^ par of
defendans showing ha hey had
acually discoered gold probably in
paying quaniies wihin he boundaries
of he weny acres in dispue, which
aken in connecion wih he eidence
of marking he boundaries  some ime
prior o he rial and in fac enclosing
he claim wih a wire fence and he
working in he unnel, would seem o
indicae ha defendans had perfeced
a good locaion o he weny acres, as
he law sood prior o July Is of his
year, when he new ac proiding for
he manner of locaing lode and placer
mining claims wen ino effec, bu as
his discoery is no clearly shown o

Book "SECRET OF lEUTV UNO CQQO HELTH" athat of plaintiff, sought
to hold possession of the claim by
reason of work done in constructing a
tunnel thereunder, but the court in de
ciding against him said:
"As to any claim to the possession
(of the mining claim) based on occu
pancy by the tunnel under a portion of
plaintiff's location such occupancy, if it
could be considered at alt under the
statutes would extend oniy to the space
within the walls" of the tunnel, and
could not be extended beyond them by
any rule of constructive possession.^
there was evidence on th^ part of
defendants showing that they had
actually discovered gold probably in
paying quantities within the boundaries
of the twenty acres in dispute, which
taken in connection with the evidence
of marking the boundaries . some time
prior to the trial and in fact enclosing
the claim with a wire fence and the
working in the tunnel, would seem to
indicate that defendants had perfected
a good location to the twenty acres, as
the law stood prior to July Ist of this
year, when the new act providing for
the manner of locating lode and placer
mining claims went into effect, but as
this discovery is not clearly shown to
have been made prior to the filing of
defendants cross complaint but on the
contrary appears to have been made dur
ing the pendency of ihe trial it is un
necessary to determine whether defen
dants have thus acquired, a valid loca
tion as no relief can be granted in this
action, to defendants based upon a title
acquired subsequent to the filing of the
cross complaint.
A judgment will be entered adjudg-:
ing that neither plaintiffs nor defen
dants are entitled to any relief in this
action.
