A BORN LAWYER
A lawyer adertised for a clerk
The ext' morning his office was
crowded with applicants, all bright,
and many suitable He bade them
wait until all should arrie, and then
ranged them in a row, and said he
would tell them a story/ note their
comments, and judge from whom he
wouid chose
"A certain fanner," began the
lawyer, "was troubled with ; a red
squirrel, that got in through" a hole
in bis barn, and stoic his seed corn
He resoled to kill the squirrel at
the first opportunity Seeing him
go in at the hole one noon, j he took
his shotgun aud fired away The
first shot set the barn on fire"
"id the barn burn?" said one of
tho boys
"The lawyer, without answer,
continuedPersonal "And, seeing the baru
on fire, the farmer seized a pail of
water, and ran to put it out"
"id he put it out?" said another
"As be passed inside, the door
shut to, and the barn was soon in
flames When the hired girl rushed
out with more water"'
"id they all burn up?" said an
other'boy >"
"The lawyer weut on without ans
werPersonal
"Then the lady came out, aud all
was noise and confusion, ; and eery
body was trying to put out the fire"
"id auyouc burn up?" said an
other
The lawyer saidPersonal "There, thatwilf
do; you hae all shown your interest
in the story" But, obsering one
little bright-eyed fellow in deep
silence, he saidPersonal ''Now, my little
mau, what hae you to say?"
The little fellow blushed, grew un
easy, and stammered outPersonal "I want,
to know what became of that squir
relPersonal that's what I want to know"
"You'll do," said the lawyer;
"you are my man You hae not
been switched off by a confusion,
and a barn burning, and the hired
girls, and water-pails; you h^e
kept your eye on the squirrel"'

Nature's 'Wonders
The common flea leaps 200 times its
own length To show, like agility a
man six feet tall would hae to leap a
distance of 1,200 feet The cheese
mite is about one-quarter of an inch
in length, yet it has been seen to take
the tip of Its tail in Its mouth and
then, letting go with a jerk, to leap out
of a essel six Inches in depth To
equal this a man would hae to jump
out of a well from a depth of 144 feet
And equally strange things are found
among the plants and egetables A
well known student of nature once
tried the growing force of a squash
When It was eighteen days old and
measured twenty-seen inches In cir
cumference, be fixed a sort of harness
around it, with a long leer attached
The power of the squash was measur
ed by the weight It lifted, tho weight
being fixed to the leer When It was
twenty days old, two days after the
harness was fixed on it, It lifted sixty
pounds On the nineteenth day It lift
ed 5,000 pounds
Mnch Ado Altnnt an "S"
The printing of the Bible Is the most
strictly guarded work in existence,- a
fact which appears strange until we
reflect on the mischief an inaccurate
Bible might bring about The king's
printers and the two uniersities of
Oxford and Cambridge gie to the
world all the Bibles printed  in the
United Kingdom except some printed
by special license A few years ago
the question arose whether the word
"spirit" in Matthew i, 1, and Mark 1,
12, should hae a capital "S," it haing
been preiously printed with a small
one, and, although the word was obi
ously wrongly printed^it was not until
after the ruling powers at the uniersi
ties aud the king's printers had met in
solemn council that leae was gien to
use the capital letter
Nothing sanctioned by authority In
1011 'may be changed without creating
something akin to reolution in the
places where Bibles are printed—Li

trict They 'got Into conersation,
which soon turned on the subject of
music, and the general, who did not
know his companion, expressed a most
enthusiastic preference for that of It
aly "I can hardly go so far with you,"
replied the other "For me, art has no
frontiers, and I gie German music
the preference oer Italian"
"Indeed, sir," said the general testi
ly "For my part, I would gie all the
German operas In the world for one
net of 'RlgolettQ' "
"You really must excuse me from
following you any j further on this
ground," replied the composer, blush

of many other quadrupeds, is the ery

At 1 o'clock the other morning a well
dressed man strolled into one of tho
uptown messenger offices lie had been
dining out and eidently, from the rak
ish tilt to his opera hat, the dinner had
been a success ;" Personal
"I want a messenger boy to come and"
waken me in the morning"
"What hour?" ; The clerk ; was all
business, for the request was not un
usual |  ; >
"Seen o'clock I'e got to catch a
train," he explained
"All right, sir; 7 o'clock," assured the
clerk   ,
The man turned as he was going out
of the door "Hae the boy hammer
tho door hard," he cautioned "I'm a
'dead one' when I get to sleep, and I'e
got to catch that train" Then he went
home and went to sleep with absolute
confidence' ;V ;
The whistles were blowing 7 o'clock
A small boy in uniform hammered
with , a club, t his "wakener," on the
door of the man who had dined the
night before •' "Get up in therel" he
cried "Get up, you old sleepyhead!"
"You go away from my door" comes
in sleepy tones from the room "It's a
mistake I 'don't want to get up"
"Oh, yes, you do, my dodo bird," Is
the fresh reply And the tattoo on the
door goes on with redoubled strength
"All right, boy; I'm awake nowH
howls the man who has been sleeping
"You can go away now"
 "Not till you'e signed  this receipt"
the boy insists 
The man has to crawl out of bed and
come to the door I The boy has a paper
ready, and as he Is a careful man t he
reads before signing It certifies that
he has been thoroughly wakened by
Messenger No 432 and that he is not
going bock'to bed again that day

COOKING FISH IN ENGLAN
The Method Used There Renders the
Flesh Flakr and Juicy
John Bull certainly knows how to
cook, fish, to proe which fact one has
only to notice the Juiciness and good
flaor of the first bit of fish, sered
perhaps at a little out of the way Inn,
that one tastes In England We Amer
icans hae at command many fine a
rieties of fish, but too "often find It sent
to table in a "woolly," tasteless condi
tion 7 •
An American cousin isiting in an
English family made bold to ask what
method of cooking "sea food" was
prealent In England and found that
there the Importance of the thorough
cooking of fish as a safeguard against
ptomaines Is as much regarded as with
us Our old country friends, howeer,
assure us that there is not the slight
est occasion to render flsh dry and
tasteless In order to insure thorough
cooking if proper attention is gien to
basting One cannot well imagine any
thing hotter than boiling fat, and la
ing plentifully with this Is to make use
of the surest ammunition possible for
the routing of deadly bacteria
Instead of warning amateurs against
underdone flsh, let copious basting with
sweet boiling fat be Insisted on, and in
place of a woolly, flaorless result
there will be the opposite— fiakincsa
and Juiciness Oerboiling will pro
duce woolliness as surely as oerfrying
or bating To insure tender, solid
flakes in, for instance, boiled cod or
halibut and- to aoid dissipating the
flaor make sure the water boils when
the fish Is put in; keep at a gentle
boil; allow only ten minutes to the
pound and tie carefully in cheesecloth
that has been washed and boiled be
fore using Cod well ba"sted with hof
olie oil or any good fat will be almost
gamy to flaor, as will cod steaks
cooked in deep fat— Washington Star

SPRINKLING SINGAPORE
The Solemn Procenslon That Accom-
panics the Watering Cart
Poultney Blgelow In his description
of the marelous progress made by the
city of Singapore under English 'rule
gae a quaint picture of the manner In
which the streets are wateredPersonal
The watering cart was drawn by lit
tle white bullocks and drien by Ma
lays with turbans " It seemed to take
fie Malays to do this driing" One
roosted aloft on tup of the barrel for
the purpose of controlling the outgo of
water He seemed ery proud of his
appointment Another natie In a big
turban roosted on the pole and con
trolled the little cattle
Then there was n man In thin brown
legs and much turban who walked sol
emnly behlud enjoying a footbath He
was obiously a goernment function
ary, although his exact sphere of use-,
fulness I could not discoer He ap
peared to be something In the nature
of a rear guard
Then there was a "foreloper," or ad
ance guard, for the purpose of clear-
Ing the way There appeared to be an
Idea that the little bullocks might sud
denly go mad and rush ahead At any
rate, it gae congenial employment to
one more natie, and that was some
thing /
These was yet another, who bent
down now and then to pick up a plecft
of stone or brush away some Irregular
ity unseen by ordinary eyes
This outfit was a treat to me It was
solemn; it was full of self conscious
ness; It was magnificently oriental
I hae seen men In sublime moments;
I hae seen the red capped station mas
ter of Germany strut up and down his
platform when on Imperial train was
about to arrie, but een that impress
ed me less than the watering cart of

At the ancient ceremonies of corona
tion of the French kings, after the
anointing had been performed, some
white does were let loose in the
church This was supposed to symbol
ize the power of the Holy GhostMn di
recting the king's actions A similar
Idea seems to hae inspired all early
kings, for among the English regalia
is the rod of equity or the scepter with
the doe This Is simply a golden rod

"It was a new gun, your honor," pro
tested the prisoner* "and I did not

"But," argued the Judge, "the dealer

"What has that to do with It?"
"Well, if you didn't pay for it the

IAMON BACK TERRAPIN
Formerly espised, Personal They Are Wow
Considered a elicacy
 naif a century or so ago diamond
back terrapin were fed to slaes an 4
hogs Today they are the rarest deli
cacy known to the epicurlan world,
says the Philadelphia North American
Then they sold for ?1 a barrel, %nd
iaborern, when hiring out, specified
that they must not be compelled to eat
terrapin more than twice a week To
day a barrel is cheap at $800, and mil
lionaires trael hundreds of milea for
a chance to feast on this most deli
cious of all meats
Of course thiß means genuine dia
mond backs There are many Imita
tions  i^* ;  PersonalrPersonal r
Eery first class restaurant  In the
country features "terrapin a la Mary
land" on its menu, "but in not one case
out of a hundred is the real terrapin
sered The diner regales himself on
what he beliees to" be Maryland's
choicest dish Instead he is merely
eating fresh water turtles, "sliders" or
"North Carolina goldens"
-The reason la simple Restaurateurs
don't sere real diamond backs fce
cause they can't get them The world's
total terrapin population does not ex
ceed 25,000 of legal size, and these ate
confined to the shores of the Chesa
peake bay, -the only place that produces
them
Baltimore, Philadelphia and New
York enjoy a monopoly" These three
cities get practically the entire output,
but few eer find their way across the
Blue Ridge The epicure unfortunate
enough to be born i Chicago or St
Louis must either come east or forego
the Joys of terrapin
To select a real diamond back ama
teurs should be guided by these dlstta
guishlng and characteristic markingsPersonal
It is of a greenish, dark olie crjor,
sometimes running to spotted gray,
yellow on the plate which surrounds
the shell and has concentric dark
stripes along the plate on both shells
The sides of the head are a dirty whtye,
sprinkled with small black spots Thd
bottom shell Is of whitish yellow
The males are much larger than the
females and hae the concentric streaks
much better defined The female has
the more delicate flesh The male can
be distinguished by his toe nails, which
are much longer than those of tho fe
male

THE MEXICAN EITOR
It Is Veiy Easy For Htm to Get Into
Serious Trouble
The newspaper laws of Mexico are
ery stringent If any person I*B men
tioned in a newspaper article and feeto
offended about it, he can easily send
the ediWr of the paper and the writer
of the article to prison The state
ments may Ij^e been far within tQ9
limits of truth and Justice, but that
makes no difference The editor In
communicado has a chance to think
about the law, and the aggrieed per
son smiled pleasantly After awhile
the law gets in its work, the case is In
estigated, and the editor is punished,
for een the truth Is libelous, and libel
Is one of the offenses most seerely
condemned
According to the theory of the Mexi
can law, eery person has a right to go
about entirely free from annoyance by
other persons If the person iolates
the law, the newspaper has no right to
say so It can lay Information before
the courts if It wants to, but It must
not say in its columns that it has done
so Then the law will step in and take
charge of the offender, but the repre
sentaties of the paper will not be al
lowed to attend the trial, and only the
bare result, after weeks, of waiting,
can be told to the public
If the offense charged against the ed
itor is regarded by the first magistrate
to whom the complaint is made as be
ing especially grae, the paper is gen
erally suppressed The complaint has
been receied and passed upon Then
a squad of police descends upon the
printing office Sometimes all the em
ployees  are arrested, sometimes only
the editor Then the r doors of the
building are closed, official seals are
placed upon them, and a guard is sta
tioned to see that no one tries to en
ter For three days the editor can do
nothing The laws under which he Is
arrested are modeled after those of the
code Napoleon, and for three daya he
Is held incommunicado, while the au
thorities hunt up eidence Then he
is gien" a hearing, j In the meantime
his paper has been suppressed, and In
many cases it neer comes to life again,
een though the editor may eentually
clear himself of all blame— Plttsburg

PETROLEUM
Probable Life of the  Prodnct iscussed
Human foresight is at best only 7a
ery imperfect ision and sees er
rors quite as often as it sees truth
Twenty years ago the then experts
in petroleum predicted that the end
of, the production in the United
States on a large scale was io sight
Now they are confronted not only
with a steady yield of oil much
greater than any known at the time
when they | so confidently asserted
that the oil fields were pretty well
exhausted, but they hae to face 'an
expansion in the petroleum output
of the United i States which is al
together beyond precedent Recent
additions to the former capacity of
the oil regions are far' greater than
the entire flow of the Pennsylania
fields in their best estate
The rapid increase is not confined
to the wonderful new fields in Texas
The Indiana petroleum region is the
scene of much work in the way of de- J
elopment, and there are many new
wells- of good capacity -  Een in
Pennsylania the supply of petrole
um holds out far better than it
seemed likely to many years ' ago
Nor is any expert in petroleum as
sure now that the limit of discoery
has been reached as many authori
ties were before great deposits of
oil had been fouud in Western Ohio,
Indiana, California arrd Texas
There are still some, howeer, who
predict now, as formerly, that the
exhaustion of coal and petroleum de
posits is sure to result from the <
present prodigal waste of - those
natural stores They say that, how
eer prodigal nature may hae been
in bestowing such wealth upon the
American people, and impossible -
though it is to set limits to the de
elopments of the near future in
such directions as is eideut that in
the long run the progress of the
human race toward ideal fuel, light
and power must be in other direc
tions- The  coal will be' exhausted
in time, and the petroleum far
sooner Experiencehas taught that
natural gas can be depended upon
only a few decades, at best, in any
locality The stores of distant ages,
accumulated ' through ast cycles, Personal
are used up in a few years or cen
turies \
Such sorrowing souls should quiet
their fears Long before the cen
turies roll around to the time when
the coal beds and petroleum de
posits shall hae become exhausted
science will hae perfecred other

OL IEAS ABOUT GEMS
Pearls Were Thought to Be ' ew-
drops Caught by the Shell
The Indians called rock crystal an
"unripe diamond," and until the begin
ning of the eighteenth century India
was thought to be the only land which
produced that precious stone It wais
not, therefore, until the discoery ot
India that the diamond was known to
us Yet as far back as 500 B C a
"didactic history" of precious stones
was written, and in Pliny's time the
supply must hae been plentiful, as he
wrote, "We drink out of a mass of
gems, and our drinking essels ay?
formed of emeralds" We are also tojd
that Nero aided his weak sight by,
spectacles made of emeralds
But Is ery difficult to determine
whence all the gems cftnie, as disco
erers took care to leae no record The
nations who traded in them were
afraid of their whereabouts being
known, and een the most ancient mer
chants would not disclose any definite
locale All sorts of myths hae ac

origin of gems "iamond", was tha

GET REGISTERE
The question of registration is a
serious one Its importance in the
coming campaign dwarfs all other
matters The apathy in this regard
is phenominal Not only in Ama
dor county, but throughout the
state this indifference is noticed, and
is the subject of discussion by politi
" cal bodies The all-important con-
sideration in Amador for republi-
cans is to jret tho oters of that
party in the oting line We hae
no fear of the result at the polls pro
iding republicans do not lose any
greater percentage of otes by
reason of non -registration than the
democrats Republicans not only
hae the numerical strength to
break up the ruling clique that has
held sway for these many years, but
there is the disposition to do so, and
this tendency is not confined to the
republican party There ought to
be ample opportunity afforded by
the officers concerned to get citizens
registered with the least possible in
conenience It does not look well
to show the partisan spirit too plain
ly in this matter We obsere that
the notice in regard to re-registration
is being published in one solitary
democratic paper, and in lone In
that adertisement it is noticeable
that the deputies for registration
purposes are composed exclusiely of
members of the democratic party
It is also noticeable that such im
portant towns as Amador City and
Plymouth hae no resident deputy
authorized to register oters This
is entirely out of joint with the
practice in other counties In
Contra Costa county for instance,
towns like Crockett and Antioch are
gien three and four deputies, and
it is not to be assumed that they are
all of the same political faith This
is as it should be The official that
performs his duty in this respect in
a broad and liberal spirit, with the
sole iew of getting eery qualified
oter on the great register is far
more likely to intrench himself in the
good opinion of citizens, regardless
of party, than the one who endeaors
to use his office in the interest of the
democratic party, or any other
political organization A broad
gauge policy in registration busi
ness is the only one that will com
mend itself to American citizens
The republican county central com
mittee" should take a hand in this
matter without delay That com
Personal mittee, into whose hands the inter
ests of the party are confided, can
perform no greater serice to their
 party than by taking some steps to
see that republicans are registered
If necessary, it should hire a suit
able man to go all oer the county,
clothed with authority to register
oters, and call on them personally
for that purpose, paying all his
traeling expenses while on this
mission The question of the small
registration fee should be allowed to
cut no figure in this arrangement
Let the fee go to the clerk -All re
publicans want is to hae the same
opportunity, on a smaller scale per
haps, to register their men that the
democrats hae If democratic of
ficials are disposed to place a
stumbling block in the way of mak
ing an amicable arrangement of that
kind, let them show their hand, and
let the oters pass judgment upon
their conduct at the polls 
THE ROA BILLS
The practice which has been fol
lowed in this county for years,
namely of the superisors present
ing bills in their own name for road
work done in their respectie dis
tricts and drawing the money there
for in a lump sum, is up to the dis
trict attorney for his legal opinion
The Ledger has on seeral occasions
railed attention to this system It
has contended, and still contends,
that it is contrary to plain proision
of the statutes, and that the bills
so allowed by the superisors them
seles, are liable to protest by any
citizen; that if an appeal were had
to the courts, the chances are that
the claims would be declared illegal,
not because they do not represent
alue receied, but for the illegal
method of their presentation In
no other county in the state can we
find a similar system preailing
The practice was adopted in Ama
dor under democratic rule No pro
test was made against it for a num
ber of years, although it gae birth
to considerable aderse comment by
the people, particularly those who
hae come here from other counties,
and who at once noticed the differ
ence between the course followed
here and the procedure in such mat
ters in the counties from which they
came The law is mandatory —
nothing-more so in connection with
the county goernment — that a full
and complete record must be kept
in the minutes of the proceedings
of the board of superisors Not
only must a record be kept, but it
must be published in full The pur
pose of this is obious Through
the county papers the citizens are
informed of eery dollar paid by
order of the superisors, and to
whom paid^ The idea cannot be
tolerated for a moment that the law
is less exacting in such matters,
than a priate corporation would be
in the transaction of its business
What would be thought of the
directors of a mining corporation
who, under the plea of saing cleri
cal labor of book-keeping, should
lump all the claims for wages of em
ployes, and allow the bills in lump
form in their own names, draw the
money therefor, and then distribute
the cash to the indiiduals who
actually did the work Would such
a> wage-paying system be tolerated
by any company? And yet that is
precisely the method that has been
followed in Amador county for years
so far as road expenditures are con
cerned The names of the parties
who do the work and who finally get
the money hae no place in the of
ficial records The taxpayers are
kept in ignorance of the men em
ployed and the amount paid to each
Look at the record in the minutes
published this week Between $3000
and $4000 is allowed the superisors
for labor on roads Where else in
the state of California — or any other
state for that matter — will you find
a record like this Who gets the
benefit of this money? We know
the superisors themseles do not,
for that is contrary to the spirit and
letter of the law Why then is it
made to appear on the face, of the
minutes that they are the real bene
ficiaries Why are scores of names
of claimants suppressed, and one
county official, who does not and
cannot under the law receie one
dollar for road work outside of sal
ary for oerseeing the same, sub
stituted in their place? Why are
the taxpayers— who are the real em
ployers and wage-payers — kept in
the dark, when the law says they
shall be kept posted on such matters
by publication of itemized accounts
If the system is meritorious as re
gards the road funds, why is it not
also applied to the current expense
and hospital funds? Why not allow
the superintendent of the hospital
to lump all the bills for hospital sup
plies and serices in ona bill in his
own name, and draw the money, and
act as paymaster himself for that
institution? That would also sae
clerical labor Why not hae the
county clerk put in a claim each
month for the sum total of all the
bills for current expenses, and pay
off the respectie claimants? That
would sae nine-tenths of the labor
inoled in the present method of
keeping books And it would be no
more out of ioint with legal enact
ments than the present" method of
auditing road bills
The only reason that has been
urged in defense of this system,
apart from the mere saing of cleri
cal labor, is that to require each
wage-earner to put in a separate
bill would entail hardship and ex
pense upon them, inasmuch as eery
bill has to be sworn to, and_this
would necessitate an appearance
before a notary or justice of the
peace There is no merit in this ob
jection We are informed the super
isors hae been gien to under
stand that they hae no authority
as superisors to swear the claim
ants to road bills As a matter of
fact we know this has been done in
the past history of Amador county
What is the meaning of this section
of the Political Code
4028 Any member of the board (of •
superisors) may administer oaths to
any person concerning any matter sub
mitted to them or connected with their
powers or duties
Who will say" that this does not
confer authority to take the nec
essary oath of a claimant to a bill
against the county for road work or
any other 'serice for which a de
mand is to be presented before the
board of superisors The opinion
of the district attorney on this ques
tion will be awaited with interest
The diorce mill of Amador coun
ty has been running at an unusually
liely gait during the past year
Between May 1, 1901, and May, 1902,
twenty diorce suits were started in
the superior court In the same
period there were 80 marriage li
censes issued by the couuty clerk
So that the proportion of marriages
annulled by decree of the court to
the total of marriages solemnized is

OFFERING REWAR
SUnff Gregory appeared before
the* board of superisors last Mon
day and urged that' body, to offer a
reward of 1250 for the apprehension
of young Gates, who he positiely
asserts committed the Piccardo rob
bery The board, after carefully
considering the matter, refused to
comply with the request by a unan
imous ote •We beliee they acted
wisely in so doing Whila the crime
referred to stands out in boldness of
design and nere of its execution
without a parallel '< in the criminal
annals of the county, it would be
stepping outside of the beaten track
of precedent for the county to offer
a reward for the apprehension of
the supposed perpetrator Rewards
hae been offered by this county in
cases of capital crime, but as far as
our recollection seres us, for noth
ing less To offer a reward for a
lesser offense would irtually throw
wide open the doors of the treasury
to appeals of the same import in all
felony cases Eery loer of good
goernment will rejoice to see the
bold offender in this particular case
within the grasp of the law; at the
same time, few would uphold the
superisors for offering a big reward
in the matter The reward system
in criminal cases is not without
grae objections We hae had ex
perience of its pernicious influences
in connection with crimes committed
in this county; crimes the enormity
of which justified the offering of a
reward— if the system is justifiable
at all The cause of justice would
not be promoted by extending the
head money system, neither will it
be materially injured in this or any
other county by adhering to the
policy of refusing to apply it to
cases below the grade of murder

NOTICE-^
When you are about to buy a suit
of clothes, it would be absurd to go
to a carpenter's shop When in
need of medicine, you would not call
on # the blacksmith to prescribe for
you To reasonable people it will
appear that to buy a suit there is
but one place, and that is the tailor
shop, where your suit can be fitted
on you before being made up; and
where you can select your goods,
not from a piece of scrap on paper,
where in nine cases out of ten when
your suit arries it isn't at all what
you selected If you buy it home
you can select your goods from a
large assortment of piece goods, and
can see what you are getting for
your money Your ready made
suits are pressed and remodeled with
no extra charge; this I guarantee
Remember mine is the only place in
Jackson where you can hae this
done free of charge
Hae just receied a brand new
line of spring and summer goods all
ready made and to be made up to
order Men's, Youth's and child-
ren's clothing of the latest styles
Trusting to receie a call from
you, and thanking 3'ou for your past
faors, and soliciting the same in
the future,

The funeral of Mamie Tarn, which
took place last Saturday, was one of
the largest witnessed' in Jackson for a
long time Serices were held in the
Catholic church, Iby the Re Father
Gleason The floral pieces, of which
there wore fully 150, were marelous in
design and workmanship, and testified
to the affectionate ' remembrance in
which the-young lady was held in this
com'tnunity,'* and' tho deep sympathy
for the bereaed family
A call was issued for a meeting to be
held in Jackson last Saturday to con
sider the matter of haing a fourth of
July celebration at the county seat
The attendance was small, owing it
was said, to its being a busy eening,
so the meeting was postponed until
Wednesday eening On that eening
no one attended This lack of interest
has thrown a cold bath oer the pro
ject Probably the business men will
do something later on, when the time
becomes so limited that nothing can be
done effectually
The Sacramento street fair will open
next Monday It promises to eclipse
eerything in that line eer witnessed
at the capital city An attendance of
at least 40,000 people from the outside
is looked for The hotels and restaur
ants hae agreed not to increase rates
of board or lodging during the week of
festiity  All the space on the midway
has been taken No doubt there will
be a liberal attendance from Amador
county at this celebration The peo

themseles in their efforts to cater to
the pleasure and entertainment of

Big Fire at Oleta
The news reached Jackson Monday
morning that tho business portion of the
town of Oleta was practically wiped out
early that morning The fire started
in the United States hotel, about 5
o'clock that morning, while preparing
for breakfast Tho facilities for fight
ing fire are meager, there being a scant
supply of water The flames spread
rapidly, and jumped across the street
In a brief space the town was literally
wiped out Wo hae been unable to
get the full particulars, but aro in
formed both hotels, United States and
Townsend House, two saloons, drug
store, and three dwellings, with all
their contents, wero destroyed All
tho buildings were frame, and disap
peared in smoke ery quickly The
loss is hard to compute It will prob
ably amount to between $15,000 and
$20,000 The aggregate insurance
amounted to less than $2000 The fire
is a serious blow to the struggling town
It has been in a depressed condition for
a number of years, and this heay blow
coming after a prolonged siege of dull

THAT PICCARO HOL-UP
On the Trail of the Sup
posed Perpetrator
His  Present Whereabouts Unknown,
General Impression That He
Has Left the State
It is generally known, because it has
been freely circulated throughout the
county during the past week, that sus
picion strongly points to George Gates
jr, as the perpetrator of the hold-up at
Piccardo's saloon on the night of Fri
day, April 11 A chain of circum
stances has been forged that has so im
pressed the opinion of his guilt in the
minds of the officers, that no effort
whateer is now directed in any other
channel for the unraelment of that
bold crime except the discoery of the
whereabouts of that indiidual
At the time we went to press last
week, Sheriff Gregory was on his way
back from Alaineda, whither he went
to locate Gates, and confirm or disse
pate the suspicions that had been
created respecting him He left here
Thursday morning of last week, and
i expected to get back Friday His
mission to the bay was only reealed
to one or two persons, with instruc
tions to tell no' one about the affair
uring Friday, howeer, the report
was all oer the county that the sheriff
had caught his man, and would bring
him back that night But he returned
alone, and repudiated the stories that
wore floating around, and was ery in
dignant that his name had been con
nected with them as author  It was
true that ho wont to Alaraeda, with
the expectation of bringing back the
accused This expectation was basod
on information receied from official
sources in that city, and which proed
to be false Hence the dissapointing
outcome, and the circulation of the an
noying stories referred to
From Sheriff Gregory we hae ob
tained a full history of this remarkable'
case, rendered doubly notorious on ac
count of the ease with which the alleged
criminal has managed to slip through
the hands of the officers who hae been
so eager to land him in limbo The
facts show a lamentable lack of co
operation among the peace officers,
which is tho main cause of this
miscarriage of justice "; ;
The robbery was committed on the
11th of April, Friday, between 8 and 9
o'clock at night For seeral days
preious to the robbery young Gates—
who was stopping at Nixon's hotel in
Sutter Creek— had appeared on the
street haing a bandage on his hand,
one finger of which had been injured
while working in the Central Eureka
mine He worked in the mine long
enough to earn $36 He was a frequent
isitor in Jackson The morning after
the robbery he showed up in his room
at the hotel, and meals were taken to
his room by the waiters It is also
claimed that his wounds were dressed,
and that bird shot was actually, picked
out of his arm by attendants, and all
these suspicious facts were kept from
the knowledge of the officers until long
after the accused had left the county
Instead of being seriously wounded, as
was at first supposed by inspection of
the bloody duster found at the Bell
wother mine, Gates was around as
usual There was uo lameness obser
able No bandaged hand or arm was
In sight, according to tha orthodox
ersion All this tended to aert sus
picion from him A day or so after the
hold-up, Constable Kay saw him in
Sutter Creek, and Gates greeted him
with this remark as he held out his
hand in recognitionPersonal "Well, I suppose
you are after me ' ' Others from Jack -
son saw him and drank with him dur
ing two or three days following the
crime, and if they saw anything that
aroused suspicion they kept their
thoughts locked up in their own minds
On tho 14th he paid a month's board
at the hotel to landlord Nixon, amount
ing to $24 This was not in full At
the same time he said he intended to
stay another month This was the
last that Nixon saw of him He left
Sutter Creek on the 15th, in the after
noon It is belieed that he took the
train at Valley Springs
From a letter receied by Sheriff
Gregory from the sheriff of Stanislaus
county, it appears that young Gates
was at a ranch near Modesto on the
20th, wounded in the wrist, and told
parties that the officers had his pistol;
that it was a cinch against him; that
he had been shot in the wrist
On the eening of the 22d of April]
George Gates sen arried in Sutter
Creek He inquired of the barkeeper
of Nixon's hotel where his son George
was, and was told that he was at
Paloma He then asked, "o you
know he is there" The barkeeper
suggested an inquiry direct by tele
phone, but Mr Gates saidPersonal "Neer
mind, I am going oer there myself "
He was gien young Gates' room He
came down early next morning, and
went off by stage, taking with him
young Gates' trunk, filled with all his
belongings found in the room
The knowledge of Gates' isit to
Sutter Creek was known the same
night to at least one peace officer
Constable Kay says he was In Sutter
Creek that eening, and saw him get
down from the stage, but he attached
no particular significance to the fact
On tho 25th Sheriff Gregory was in
Sutter Crock, and heard for tho first
time about this brief isit, for tho sole
purpose as it seemed of taking away
the effects of young George This fur
nished tho looked-for clew He at
once communicated with the chief of
police of Alameda, to know if Gates
was at his home, and was answered
that ho was, but that there was noth
ing the matter with hjm Not satisfied
with this, he determined to go In por>
son and inostigato for himself Ac
cordirjgly he left Thursday of last
week, and on arriing in Alamoda,
went to Gates' residence in company
with a police officer of that city Who
should open the door but George Gates
sen The sheriff plainly told him his
unpleasant mission, and said that his
son was accused of the Piccardo rob
bery The father said he was sorry,
that' he did not learn that business
from him; that the accused was not
there, neither was his younger son,
Vernon He had no objection to the
searching of the premises, but said on
his honor as a man the officers' would
find nothing of an Incriminating nature
The trunk which he had brought from
Sutter Creek was pointed out and ex
amined It was empty The new suit
which it had contained, wad missing
The father manifested a sorely grieed
spirit oer the affair, but not a sur
prise as if the sad tidings were heard
for the first timo
Sheriff Gregory was completely
baffled, and returned home the next
THE RECOVERE OUTFIT
It is more than probable that the
pistol, hat, bolt and duster recoered,
shot-pitted and bloody— the unmistak
able earmarks 'of this crime— were
stolen from a closet In r Endicott's
office Tho reoler is an old-fashionod
one, and was put in the closet loaded
It was neer used, and he did not miss
the articles until, after thoy were re
coored He could not swear posi
tiely that they aro his property, but
they are like articles of liko character
that he kept It was not unusual for
young Gates to isit his office, and ac
cess to the closet was not difficult
either day or night r Endicott had
treated him for his crushed finger a
week or two before tho robbery On
the night after tho robbery the doctor
and Charley Freeman were' in Sutter
Creek to get the paraphernalia for the
athletic club, and while there saw
Gates, shook hands with him, and went
up to his room, but nothing out of the
way was noticed either in his walk,
manner, or appearance generally
The general impression is that the
accused has left tho state, If not the
country --   
Back Broken
r Gall was called to Bear rier
camp again last Sunday, on account of
a serious accident that occurred there,
by which a man named Vie Ferrara
receied injuries that will probably
disable him for life Ferrara was em
ployed upon the dam that is being
built at that camp In hoisting by
means of a derrick an immense rock
that had been blasted from the quarry,
one of the guy ropes broke, and the
boom or pole fell, striking Ferrara
below the shoulders, injuring the spinal
column The ictim was paralyzed
below the hips He was tenderly cared
for as far us possible, at the camp, and
preparations wore at once made to con
ey him to Jackson The soft snow
between' Bear rior and Ham's station
precluded the possibility- of coneying
him by sled Tho only alternatie was
to carry him on a litter oer this stretch
of fourteen miles This- was done
Twele men were needed for this ser
ice, six at a time changing at short
interals It took them only fie hours
to reach Ham's station From Ham's
he was brought down by coneyance,
and reached here about 5 o'clock Mon
day afternoon Tho Standard Electric
Company are setting a noble example
In cases of accident to employes In
this instance they bore all the expense
of surgical attendance, coneying tho
patient to Jackson, and will pay for
nursing, maintenance and medical at
tention here The patient stood the
ordeal of tho trip remarkably well
r Gall reports that ho was much im
proed Tuesday morning The sense
of feeling extended at that time to his
knees Hopes are entertained for his
recoery

MINING NOTES
The Bay State Mining Company set
tlod for delinquent state and county
taxes last Monday Tho taxes bae
been allowed to go delinquent for se
eral yoars The sum of $99690 was paid
on account of delinquent taxes, and also
the amount due " for taxes for the
current; making considerably oer
$1000 paid by this company This is
an augury that tho outlook for the
mine is encouraging, and the intention
of the present company to complete i&s
purchase
Keystone— The first full monthly
clean-up of the Keystone since the ad
ditional stamps were added was made
recently and the result was highly sat
isfactory Fie thousand tons were
crushed during April The yield
aeraged about $4 per ton This is a
low grade, but still a good paying
proposition under the improed con
ditions of mining that now exists at
the Keystone It was expected to
start the air compressor to run the
hoisting machinery yesterday An
other economical moe under con
templation is to hae all drilling ma
chines of the same make, and the Rand
drills hae been j selected as the most
efficient Six of these machines will
bo installed The ore is taken from
the 900 leol and leels aboe, and the
ore bodies aro so ast in the  east oin,
upon which the present prospects of
the mine are based, that there is no
likelihood of searching below the
present works for a long time About
100 men are on the pay roll; the use of
machine drills haing reduced the
working force to some extent
Bunker Hill— The pay ore en
countered in this mine as stated last
week, has widened out It Is now re
ported that' the ledge of high grade
rock is two feet thick
Argonaut-Kennedy— Tho case of
the Argonaut Mining Company against
the Kennedy Mining Company, which
has been dragging its slow pace through
the courts for the last seen years, was
argued before the United States Su
preme Court in Washington on May
Ist, and submitted A decision may
be rendered in a month, but it may be
six months before the matter is de

FA BECAME A MANIA
fTempted by Harard Book Plate*, m
octor Tnrned Tnlef
It would seem from the experience
of the Harard college library that
book plate collecting may sometimes
deelop into a dangerous and expen
sie mania A few ycars^ago theJSar
ard library fount] that the engraed
labels which it pastes on the inside of
the coers of its books as marks of its
ownership were disappearing from
some of the less used olumes Th*
older book plates, it appears, are high
ly prized by collectors, and some^of
them are particularly aluable fortfieir
artistic merit as well as foe interesting
associations with early book collect
ing in this country These were natu
rally the special prey of the thief
etecties took the matter in hand,
and the offender was discoered with
full eidence of his guilt upon him
He confessed to stealing the library's
property and to haing it in his pos
session By the time the matter reach
ed the courts the greater part of tHe
book plates had been restored, the thief
haing settled satisfactorily with the
persons to whom he had sold or gien
them, and, as the prisoner had repali}
the expense to 'which the library had
been put, the college consented to leae
the matter of sentence with the court,
which imposed a fine of $150 on ope
count and put the other count on flfe,
to be brought up again later If it should
be desirable, meanwhile placing i^e
offender under $1,000 bonds for his fu
ture appearance if he should be want
ed
A striking point in the case Is that
the guilty man is ln_ no way a^comiapri
criminal His education (he ua's a 2e
gree of doctor) and his tnste seem onlj
to hae made Jiis thefts more Intelli
gent and discriminating, howeer He
knew the alue of his peculiar botitiy,
and he knew how to dispose of fKilJjj
ery personality being a protection to
him in that part of his mlsdemeonof
Apparently the fad deeloped to a"|pa
nla and that to kleptomania in his
mind
A number of the stolen plates hae
not yet been traced at all, and collect
ors hae been warned ngainst accept
ing Harard plates of the older en
graed arieties unless there is unmis
takable eidence that they came hon
estly Into the possession of the person
who offers them

no intention of saing his life, Ijo^r
eer They wanted' the sport of Ma
ting him to the torture or at least qj
playing with him as a cat plays wljjj a
mouse The chief asked him if he
could run • He said, "Not much"
He was released and told to sae his
life if he could
Colter darted away at high speed,
and most of the 600 saages set off ajf<
er him There was a plain before hljfc
six miles wide, bounded on the far side
by a rier fringed with trees Colter
hud always been famous as a runnen
and his practice now stood him in gooq
stead, lie, made straight across tije,
plain for the stream, and the yells of
his pursuers lent him wings His foes
had remoed eery shred of clothing
from his body, and the plain was co
ered with prickly pears, so that his un
protected feet were lacerated at eery
stride J -;X
Half way across the plain he glanced
back and saw that only a few Indiana
were following him Again be ran on
and soon realized that one of his pur
suers was nearlng him He redoubled
his efforts, and blood gushed from hjs
nostrils and flowed down oer ' his
breast
The fringe of trees was near, but a
hasty backward look showed him the
pursuing brae close upon him with
spear raised Moed by a sudden Im
pulse, Colter stopped, turned and faced
the saapo *lth outstretched arms
The InuiPersonali \PersonalPersonal3 so taken aback at
this • unexpected moement that he
stumbled and fell! This was Colter's
opportunity He ran back, seized the
spear and, pinning his antagonist to
the ground, ran on s' •'''
Other saages came on, fiercer than
before at the death of their comrade,
but Colter reached the trees, plunged
into their midst and then into the rier
and swam to a pile of driftwood that
had lodged He died beneath it and
stuck his bead up between two logs
coered with smaller timbers and
brush  - ---i'
The Indians came up and searched
for- seeral hours, but failed to find
him Again and again tbey walked
oer the driftwood ' Luckily they did
not fire it as he feared they would
At last they went away Then Colter
swam out and fled through the forest
Seen days he went on, liing on
roots and berries, with po clothing, un
til at lns»t he reached a trading post on
the Bighorn rier He neer fully re
coered from the effects of this terrible
experience— Youth's Companion

It is a popular joke to say that there

two bronze animals of heroic size, one
bestrode by Victor Emmanuel and the
other by General Colleone But this la
a mistake There  are four other
horses, also of bronze,' ln the Church
of St John and St Paul, and quite a

different public buildings, making alto
gether at least fifteen or sixteen Rus
kiu and other competent critics hae
decluid the statue of Colleone to be
the best equestrian monument eer
cast in bronze It was designed and
cast by Andrea Verrocchlo, painter,
sculptor, jeweler, engraer, poet and
musician, a man of infinite genius,
whose greatest  fame lies in the fact
that he was the Instructor of the great
est artists of all centuries— Michael
Angelo, Raphael and Leonardo da Vin
ci " The statue of Victor Emmanuel Is
not so highly thought of
The horses on the top of St Mark's
are famous and hae had a trying ex
perience They date back to the pre
historic age and ure supposed to be the
work of a Greek artist named Lysslp
pus and designed for a sculptured char
iot They were taken to Rome during
the empire aud first used as ornaments
upon a triumphal arch erected by Nero
nnd afterward by Trajan " The Em
peror Constautine took them from
Rome to Constantinople, where the
oge Imndulo seized them as loot and
brought them to Venice When Napo
leon entered the city in 1797, he had
them taken down from the roof of the
cathedral and shipped them in wagons
oer the' Alps to Paris  They sered
as ornaments upon the triumphal arch
in the Place d Carrousel till 1815,
when Emperor Francis I of Austria
redeemed them, and they were replac
ed, at his expense, where they now
stand These ponderous animals are
of pure cupper, and each weighs about
"two tons They were formerly gilded,

OUR PRESIENTS
Only One Impeachment and bat Two
nesolutlontj of Censre
 Andrew* Johnson was the only presi
dent of the United States - eer im
peached, aud on the trial before the
senate he was acquitted, the ote in
faor of coniction barely falling short
of the necessary two-thirds' Personal
Two resolutions of censure on the
president hae been passed, once by
the senate and once by the house, on
occasions when the  hostile majority
was not large enough either to pass
measures oer the president's eto or
to impeach him
The tlrst was passed by the senate on
March 28, 1 1534, censuring President
Andrew Jackson for alleged iolation
of the constitution and laws by his re
moal of the goernment deposits from
the United States bank The majority
of the senate was opposed to Jackson
in his war upon that bank, and this
ote of censure was the only thing
they conld do about It  Jackson pro
tested- against this resolution as a
charge to answer which no opportunity
could be afforded him The senate re
fused to receie the protest Finally,
on Jau 10, 1837, the resolution of cen
sure was expunged from the Journal
of the senate
The second resolution of censure was
in a report adopted by the house from
the house committee to which Presi
dent John Tyler's message etoing the
tariff bill of 1842 had been referred
This report censured the president for
alleged Improper use of the eto power
Tyler protested against this, as Jack
son had done before him, but he had,
as a member of the senate, oted
against receiing Jackson's protest,
and In answer to his protest the house
sent him a copy of the senate resolu
tion on the former occasion

Animals and Salt
Among certain people there is a
strong idea that nothing is worse for
dogs than salt, but as a matter of fact,
when administered in small quantities,
it materially assists the process of di
gestion There is no doubt, howeer,
that to gie dogs or any other animals
broth or pot liquor In which salt pork
or bacon has been boiled would be al
most equialent to giing them a small
dose of poison The use of salt among
horses, cattle and sheep is adocated
by the highest eterinary authorities
Pigs, on the contrary, arc extremely
susceptible to the' poisonous influence
of the agent, and experiments hae
been made which had, after small
doses regularly administered, fatal re
sults Habitually, as a matter of course,
all animals consume a certain portion
of salt, as it exists in certain propor
tions In most articles of food— London

HAR TO GET STARTE
Thlnstn Which Oercome a Writer
When Beginning An Article
There is a f eeUng of timidity that
oftentimes oercomes a writer when
beginning an article As In writing a
letter, it is getting started that puzzles
It is the custom to begin with  slow
moing piston and work gradually Into
full speed until the flow of worfls Is
freej and then the difficulty with some
of us Is to find the Jbrake ale Again,
a writer sometimes discoers that his
beginning Is a more fitting ending, and
ice ersa The newspaper style Is to
throw general conclusions up strong
under the headlines, while the sermon
lzer reseres  them until his final cli
max
Thackeray remarked once that he
could neer tell exactly what he was
going to say until his pen was in band
and under motion and then did not fully
realize Just what he was saying until It
was written There is a subconscious
ness that shapes writing as it docs
speaking This, I know, disturbs some
well known theories of speaking and
writing— as to weighing eerything and
then measuring it out as a druggist
compounds a prescription — but my ob
serations are that the preparation Is
more in getting full of a subject and
then letting the mind work free under
the impulse of the dominating idea
There are as many ways and meth
ods in writing and speaking as there
are indiiduals, and yet the fundamen
tal law In the transmission of thought
and speech runs largely In the same
grooe, whether it be the Jargon of the
Hottentot or the polished periods of
the scholar Human nature  has Us
own primitie impulses that defy all
rules of rhetoric and the power of ex
pression—that is the power, mind you
—is deeper seated than any artificial
formula of stylists — National Maga

SOME WRITERS
Locke is said to hae spent oer six
years in the preparation of his essay,
"On the Human Understanding"
 Lamartlne, the great French poet,
was happily married and receied
great aid from his wife in all his un
dertakings
The great ante was married to a
notorious scold, and when he was in
exile be had no desire to see her, al
though she was the mother of his Six
children
Wolfe is said to hae written "The
Burial of Sir John Moore" In one een
ing directly after news had been
brought of the defeat at Coruna and
the death of the gallant British officer
A friend of the late Walter Besant
relates that the noelist always kept
on his desk before him a list of the
characters of the noel he happened to
be at work on, their relationship and
appearance
Hans Christian Andersen formed his
style by narrating his stories to ari
ous groups of children before he wrote
them down His one thought was to
become famous, and he was ery care
ful not to make Any enemies
ickens says In the introduction to
"aid Copperfleld" that he spent two
years in the composition of that noel
He did not usually require so long a
time, many of his noels being finish
