THE CONFESSION BUSINESS
There is urgen need ef more rigid and definie laws in
regard o he mehod of procuring socalled confessions from
persons accused of crime, and he use of such confessions as
eidence before a rial jury, no merely agains himself bu
also agains codefendans Insances are consanly cropping
up in he cours ending o show he necessiy of reform in
his respec s he law now sands, a confession o be ad
mied in eidence mus be freely and olunarily made, wih
ou promise of reward or inducemen of any kind This is
all righ in heory, and if he law were adhered o in is
spiri as well as he leer here would be lile room for com
plain Bu here is ofen a wide gulf beween heory and
pracice Prosecuing officers, in heir zeal o secure he
conicion of hose accused of crime, are ap o oersep he
bounds In his couny las week he major par of he
ime consumed in a criminal rial was aken up in an ex
hausie inquiry ino he manner in which an alleged con
fession was obained, so as o enable he cour o deermine
wheher or no he confession should be used as eidence
agains he defendan confessor The soluion of his side
issue inoled nearly as much expense as he rial proper
The Ruef affair in San Francisco graf prosecuion is anoher
case in poin The course of he officials in exoring con
fessions from he gang of boodlers and dealing ou immuniy
conracs, and aferwards repudiaing some of hem, has done
much owards discrediing he prosecuion in he minds of
he people There is no quesion had he officials pursued a
sraigh and honorable pah, hey would hae accomplished
more in he acual punishmen of offenders, and a he same
ime hae reained he confidence and suppor of he public
Bu hey fell ino deious ways, which are regarded as re
pugnan o our concepions of law and moraliy, and as sub
ersie of good goernmen as he schemes of he boodling
gang Officials are bu he insrumens of he people I
is no par of heir duy o compromise heir consiuens by
eering in he slighes degree from our highes ideals of
moraliy Crime mus be ferijeed ou and offenders pun
ished We beliee he sures way o ha end is by such cou
duc oward he accused as will awaken in he public m>ind
he umos faih in he prosecuion upliciy, rickiness,
or misrepresenion of any kind may well be dispensed wih
in dealing wih paries accused of wrong Beer from he
prosecuion's sandpoin ha a defendan be accorded eery
righ o which he is eniled under he law, freely and olun
arily a eery sage of he proceedings from his arres o his
final conicion or discharge If some simple rule o ha end
were adoped and made indispensible in eery case i would
be a sep in he righ direcion, and furhermore would proe

LOCL EITORIL COLUMN
PROTESTE IN VIN
By he proceedings of he board of ciy rusees published
in anoher column, i will be seen ha a bill from he Ciy
Commercial Co, an ouside prining concern, for elecion
supplies furnished for he las ciy elecion, was presened in
he sum of $720, and allowed for $6115 There is some
hing peculiar, no only in he conracion of his claim in
he firs place, bu in he manner of is presenaion, and
allowance by he board The supplies were ordered by he
hen ciy clerk, L,,J Glainoich, wihin a week afer he
presen conrac for ciy prining was awarded o he Ledger
If a conrac for any kind of supplies wih a ciy or couny
goernmen is no inended o coer eeryhing required by
such goernmen, during he period of he conrac s
abou as useless a hing as can well be imagined The law
requires ciy prining o be le by conrac o he lowes
bidder annually I is he duy of he officers o see ha
eeryhing in he prining' line is included in he schedule,
and if no so included, he work, on any reasonable inerpre
aion, goes o he priner o whom he prining conrac has
been awarded ny oher consrucion makes a mandaory
proision of he law a farce Think of a board of rusees
calling for proposals for furnishiug one soliary iem in he
job prining line, and leing a conrac o he lowes bidder
on ha iem, and herafer claim ha he ciy was free o
ake all oher prining elsewhere wihou any conrac or
fixed rae This in spirs no only wha is claimedjby our
ciy managers, bu wha has acually been done Home
indusry has been ignored, as well as heir own express
agreemen, and work sen o San Francisco in preference in
he eeh of legal proisions prohibiing such preference
Wha would be hough by he sorekeepers here, if an order
for a few shoels 01 picks for ciy work was sen o an ou
side reail house, when local dealers were prapared o furnish
hem, of equal qualiy and a less price
s conrac priner he proprieor sered a proes upon
boh he ciy rusees and clerk a he ime his order was
gien We did no know a ha ime where he order had
been sen  claim agains couny or ciy is oulawed un
less presened wihiu six monhs of he incurring of he lia
biliy fer he lapse of fie mouhs his paricular bill
crops up for allowance and paymen I calls for $720 —
a larger sum han he oal for job prining receied under
he courac during he curren year We again sered a
proes upon he ciy rusees,ciy clerk and reasurer, bu he
claim was allowed nowihsanding, afer being shorn o he
exen of $1125, for he reason ha he prining and supplies
for he preceding elecion, secured exclusiely hrough local
business houses cos ha much less han he Ciy Commer
cial Co's claim as presened, So i was no quesion of econ
ouy ha caused he work o be sen away from home The
ruh is he cos would hae been furher maerially reduced
if he iems had been scheduled in he aderised lis which
was made he basis of he bids for ciy prining •
The Ciy Commercial C 0, from recen inesigaion, is
no a legalized corporaion I is a name adoped by a com
binaion of wo or hree prining firms in San Francisco,
banded ogeher for he purpose of monopolizing he munici
pal prining of ha ciy I has been repudiaed by he
mayor afer full inquiry, reealing i's mehods
This Ciy Commercial Co's bill was made ou on one of
he regular ciy claim blanks I is all ypewrien, excep
he prined porions I is neiher signed nor sworn o, as is
usually done There is nohing o show where i came from
