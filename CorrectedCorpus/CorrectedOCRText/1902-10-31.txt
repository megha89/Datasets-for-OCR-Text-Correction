FATAL ISCOVERIES
INVENTIONS THAT BROUGHT THEIR
ORIGINATORS TO THE GRAVE
Scientific Secrets That Hare Been
Buried With the Men Who Pos
ettsed Them and That Wer» the
Causes of Their Tragic Taking O»
The maxim which states that silence
is golden has cost the world some of
the greatest discoeries of modern
times, for not a few of the inentors
whose names would hae been handed
down to posterity us public benefac
tors hae been killed by their secrets
before they would consent to diulge
them to their fellow beings
In 1595 all Europe was startled by
the discoery of a new explosie called
fulminite, which, it was belieed,
would reolutionize modern warfare
It was the Inention of an Exeter
scientist named Sawbridge, and sam
ples of thfi explosie which were test
ed 1 by the goernment reealed the fact
that its power was three times greater,
than that of cordite and In conse
quence it would treble the range of a
rifle bullet The German goernment
offered Sawbridge £20,000 for his in
ention, which he patriotically refused
until the home authorities had had the
first' option of purchase But just as
the latter were about to seal a con
tract with him the news came that his
laboratory had been blown up and him
self with it Unfortunately he left
no records whateer, and although
some of the leading experts of the day
minutely examined the debris they
failed to discoer the secret, which is
probably lost foreer
' About half a century ago an Italian
priest named Luigi Tarantl discoered
a method of making stained glass, the
coloring of which was declared equal
to that made by the ancients, whose
secret has been lost Taranti aban
doned holy orders and set to work to
execute the hundreds of commissions
he receied in the secrecy of his work
shop at Ostia, near Rome The finest
stained glass windows In Italy were
made by him, and he guarded his se
cret well, for when a year la,ter he was
found dead of blood poisoning, set up
by the pigments he employed, it was
realized that he had carried his secret
with him The cleerest workmen
were called In to examine the ingredi
ents, but they on§ and all failed to
penetrate the dead man's secret i
The person 'who could, make compo
sition billiard balls equal to those of
Iory would quickly qualify as a mil
lionaire, and It Is not an impossible
task,  for It has already been done
Some years ago a Scotch manufactur
er put composition billiard balls on the
market which were as good at but
only a third of the price of those al
ready In use He refrained from pat
enting his Inention and made all the
balls himself, een his family being
prohibited from sharing his secret
But just as he was beginning to taste
the fruits of his experiments he was
one day mortally wounded by an acci
dent In his workshop and died before
he could make any statement Ex
perts were gien specimens of the balls
to analyze, but In spite of the fact that'
they succeeded In tracing the materi
als use,d they hae long since gien up
all hopes of being able to discoer how
they were put together
The only man who has yet been suc
cessful In taking photographs in color
was a martyr to his discoery, the
secret of which is lost Some years
ago r Herbert Franklin of Chicago
submitted a number of colored photo
graphs — of a somewhat crude nature,
It is  true— to the leading American
scientific' institutions, and the encour
agement he receied was such that
he built himself a laboratory, proof
against the wiles of spies, at a cost
of f 12,000, wherein to perfect his in
ention In the preparation of his
plates he used a charcoal fire, and one
day when at work he omitted to open
fhe entilators and was found asphyx
iated He had refrained from diulg
ing his secret to any one, and in con
Bequence, although some partially fin
ished plates that hid the secret re
mained, the way they were prepared
Is a problem that has baffled scientists
to this day
Another ictim to his secret was
Adams, the inentor of tallium, the
greatest discoery in the metals of the
age Adams was confident that a metal
pould be produced which, although as
bard as steel, was only half its weight
and price, and after fie years' experi
menting with an electrical process tal
lium was the result The Inention
was taken up throughout America, and
orders for thousands of tons of the
metal began to pour in from the lead
ing railway companies
But It was too late The enormous
mental strain he had undergone,
coupled with the sensation of finding
millions within his grasp, took away
his reason, and ho was confined in an
asylum He left no records to explain
the process, and no amount of per
suasion drew the secret from bin),
Which perished locked up in his brain
when two years later he died a help

"Eery once In awhile one reads i
the newspapers of the determination
»f some one of the high j goernment
officials to discoer the source of 'the
leak' of a piece of news which it u
not desired should be gien out at that
particular time," remarked ''an old
Washington correspondent, "and with
out giing the solution to the secret
escapes of public information, •as they
ary, I 'will tell you of one instance
whiali > mr es to slow how news, ap;
pears Jin print in what is considered by
all coScerned to he a ery mysterious
manner ' Like all mysteries, "when un
raeled it is wondered that It was not
thought of before  My stof y Is en
tirely a part of the secret sources Of
information which all correspondents
hae more or less at their disposal
and which often comes from the out
side and not from the inside of th
departments
"Some  time ago— the precise time is
"not essential to the story— a ery im
portant public matter was up for de
termination by the president All of
the larger metropolitan dailies were
particularly Interested, Personal as It "did not
hae to do especially with Washing
ton, and the entire correspondents'
world at the capital was on the'qul
ie to 'get it,' including myself All
channels which were usually tapped
by the initiated were found to be as
barren "as a desert stream In midsum
mer Telegrams from the home offices
poured into our arious ' bureaus here
couched in Imperatie language that
the news 'must' be obtained, eidently,
in the belief that all correspondents
hae to do is to go out, ask officials
for the desired  information ' and re
ceie i,t, coupled with a good cigar and
a bottle of wine As a matter of fact,
when officials; wish to, keep secret a
piece of information, all possible loop
holes of escape are securely padlocked,
andit Is the exception that' it gets out
"I had about gien up hope of secur
ing a 'beat' in this particular Instance,
though I was, of course, as igilant as
eer The time for the maturing of the
project was close at hand, and any day
it might by official announcement be
come public property, j One night as I
was sitting idly In the lobby of an up
town hotel, half dozing in my chair,
waiting for the appearance of a senator
with whom I had an appointment on an
Inconsequential matter, I oerheard one
of two gentlemen who were sitting be
hind me drop the words the president,'
The high backs of "our  chairs nearly
touched, and by instinct my # drowsy,
senses became clear and I woke up"
" 'The president,' remarked one of the
gentlemen, 'said that it was his inten
tion to adopt that course irrespectie
of the consequences either to himself or
the party'
" 'Bat you pointed put to him what it
meant to s — that he was clearly In er
ror?' replied the other gentleman
" 'Elaborately,' responded the first
speaker, 'but the president said that he
was coninced that accruing results
would proe that we, and not he, were
In error'  t 
 'VThen we may as well go back to
New York tomorrow,' was the answer,
and both gentlemen arose and walked
toward the_ cafe, apparently In a ery
despondent' frame of mind
"I was an Inoluntary listener to this
scrap of conersation, in which, it will
be obsered, not a single word was
dropped as to the subject matter there
of I at once jumped to the conclusion
that the goernment, through the presi
dent's actiou, intended to take the af
firmatie oi the proposition, the news
side of which the "correspondents had
So lopg iind earnestly endeaored to
ascertain With a straight tip as to the
course of j the, goernment the corre
spondent could do the rest, while with
the wrong tip he could not only make
his paper ridiculous, but would in all
probability lose his position; hence the
care in making a scare head, page wide
story 
"In U»e furtherance of my conclusion,
my paper had the 'beat' of the season
the following morning, as I stated the
facts as though they came from official
sources, as, Indeed; such I considered
them To my mind, as n correspondent,
it was as clear as if the president him
self had gien me the information Two
days after a  member of the cabinet
gae out officially what I had wired
oer and with it the announcement that
the 'leak' had occasioned much 'annoy

proePersonal V
,Personal• One day a gypsy stopped at a house,
and, pointing to a child, said, "He'ls
sick"
"Yes, he's suffering ' from ' rheuma
tism," said the woman
| "Yes" and I can cure him, lady, If
you will let me hae six fancy plates,
but you must be sure they are nice" ;
"Oh, anything to get him well," said
the woman "I'm willing to do any
thing," and she fetched a half dozen
fine, china plates that had been her
pride ' ' I •' ,Personal ; Personal ; ,
 The gypsy set them out in a row, one
after the other,' placed her hands on
the , four center ones, mumbled some
words oer them and saidPersonal 
\ "Now, If you will let me take these
plates a way with me to destroy them
your boy will, be cured of rheumatism
No more aches and pains for him, lady;
nothing but good health,' lady, j Let me
take them, lady, and cure him''

GEORGE C PAREE, of Oakland
Congress, J N GILETTE, Humboldt
to Voters
 Voters are cautioned to use the
utmost care in stamping their bal
lots There will be seeral, places
on the ticket marked "no nomina
tion," indicating that the political
party whose heading appears at the
top of that column has made no
nomination for the officedesignated
Such a case occurs in the republican
column for county recorder, and
also in both republican and demo
cratic columns for subordinate town
ship officers ' It is necessary to
leae the blank squares to the right
of these places thus marked "no
nomination," untouched A cross
in any of ucli squares will be apt to
cause trouble on't monkey with
these "no nomination" spaces in any
way Let eery republican oter
who does not fully understand how
to mark his ballot, take his sample
ballot to some trusted person and
get him to mark it just the way he
wants to ote He can then take
the sample ballot into the booth with
him, and mark his regular ballot in
exact conformity thereto Let
eery oter also remember that if he
accidently stamps bis ballot wrong
ly — that is if be puts a cross opposite
a name or proposition he does not
wish to ote for — he can return the
ballot to the clerk as a spoiled bal
lot, and get another in place there
of The greatest danger consists in
putting a cross _in a square which
does not represent a candidate to
be oted for With this point safe
guarded, there need be little risk of
marking the ballot so as to gie
room for quibbling
Another point we wish to impress
upon republicans, namely! that a
citizen who in"his affidait of regis
tration has stated that he is able to
mark his own ballot, must not call
for assistance In an election con
test in Amador county, within recent
years, otes hae been deducted
fronTa candidate because it was
shown that the oter had receied
assistance, when his affidait showed
that he could make out his own bal
lot This ruling may seem extreme
ly arbitrary arid unjust when ap
plied to all cases For instances
there are scores of persons in Ama
dor county who cannot see without
spectacles It would be risky for
such to attempt to mark a ballot
without glasses With glasses, how
eer, they can stamp a ballot easily
Some oters hae a considerable
distance to go to the polling place?
Now in case a citizen of this class
accidentally leaes his glasses at
home, and for that reason calls for
aid in making his ballot, is it just
and right that his ote should be
thrown out on a contest Or if a
person able to make out his ballot at
the time of making the affidait of
registration, becomes disabled sub
sequently, and before election day,
and consequently is compelled to
call for help, is there any reason
why his ote should be rejected
Howeer, it is well to impress upon
citizens the necessity of taking their
artificial eyes with them to the poll
ing place, if their natural sight is
not sufficient to enable them to mark
their ballots Try to steer clear of
all these little legal snags, and ote
the republican'ticket as straight as
your conscientious scruples will
permit
J C Camp*bell, the well known re
publican orator, in a speech de
liered recently, had the following
to say in reference to the democratic
nominee for goernor It is in keep
ing with the silence he maintains
about the democratic platformPersonal He
will taik about anything and eery
thing rather than the policy mapped
out in the platform Here is his
picture politicallyPersonal
"What are Mr Lane's politics?
Has he any? At the time we found
him, when an editor of a paper in
the state of Washington, he was
igorously attacking the tariff laws
of our land and particularly the Mc
Kinley bill Again, in 1899, at the
opening of the campaign, he is quot
ed as saying that he was no partisan
and that it was the duty of all good
citizens to uphold the Philippine
policy of President McKinley In
1902 we find him nominated upon
and indorsing (for a ery short time)
a democratic platform, again de
nouncing the American tariff and
arraigning the republican party
upon the Philippine policy Then
again we find him abandoning plat
form, abandoning party, abandon
ing those who are nominated on the
ticket with him, and announcing
himself as a Rooseelt democrat
What a Rooseelt democrat is God
in his infinite wisdom alone can tell
I assure you Ido not know Hencei
I repeat, what is Mr Lane's politics"
In some quarters an effort is being |
made to prejudice the candidacy of
S G Spagnoli, because, as one of
the bondsmen of J P Thomas, trea
surer of the Knights of Pythias lodge
of Jackson, he declined to make good
a deficiency of $1500, which Thomas
at the time of his death owed to
said lodge The idea is intended to
be coneyed that Spagnoli was un
willing to meet a financial obligation
solemnly entered into as a surety for
Thomas, and that suit had to be
brought to compel him to pay This
is an unmerited reflection upon Mr
Spagnoli, and we hasten to place the
matter in its true light S G; Spag
noli and A Peroich were on the
bond of Thomas At the time the
lodge required the bondsmen to
make good the $1500, and brought
suit against the bondsmen alone for
its recoery, without including the
estate of Thomas in the suit, there
was*a sum^of money amounting to
$5013 73 lying in the county treasury
to the credit of the Thomas estate
Knowing this, the bondsmen natur
ally took the ground, that the estate
being primarily liable, should hae
been sued first, or at least coupled
with the bondsmen in the suit which
was commenced agaiust them Un
der these circumstances they deter
mined to stand trial? with the iew
not of eading the obligation, but
to get them to look to the estate as
well for the collection of the short
age Judgment, howeer, was re
coered against the bondsmen alone
for the full amount and interest, and
thereupon the judgment was prompt
ly satisfied by the two bondsmen
Thereafter the bondsmen, Spagnoli
and Peroich, commenced suit
against G A Gritton, administrator
of the estate of J P Thornas,~and
in July, 1901, obtained a judgment
for $1760, which was the sum they
had already paid to the lodge as
bondsmen, wijh interest and costs
added This judgment was at once
paid out of the funds of the Thomas
estate This roundabout way of col
lection cost the bondsmen $400 for
attorney fees and other expenses
The outcome is a complete indica
of the  position assumed by the
bondsmen, that the Thomas estate,
with ample funds to pay, should hae
been sued in the first place MrPersonal
Spagnoli acted as any reasonable
man would hae acted under the
circumstances He did not want to
shirk payment If the estate had
been without funds, the bondsmen
would hae paid without a murmur,
and without suit No man can
blame Spagnoli, and no oter can
withhold support from him as treas
urer on account of this affair
 A story has been circulated to the
effect that Mr etert and others
hae furnished the funds with which
T K Norman' has made and is now
making the canass for sheriff This
canard was started early in the cam
paign, and is being reamped in the
closing days, as a last desperate ef
fort to stem the current which has
been setting in toward Norman from
the start We hae been authorized
by Mr Norman to deny the report
in toto No man, and no body of
men, has put up one cent toward his
campaign expenses He has made
the fight on his own financial re
sources entirely Een if the story
were true, we cannot see that it
would amount to a ery serious
offense either in the eyes of the law
or of strict morality But as a mat
ter of fact there is not a scintilla of
truth in it Mr Norman will pay
fie hundred dollars to any one who
can proe that one dollar of his ex
penses in making the canass for
sheriff and tax collector has been
contributed by any one other than
himself
The candidacy of F M Angelotti,
on the republican ticket for associate
justice of the supreme court, appeals
strongly to the oters of Amador
county He has held the position of
superior judge in Marin county for
many years, and so acceptably has
he discharged the duties of that of
fice, that he was selected as emi
nently qualified for the supreme
bench His strongest recommenda
tions come from the neighborhood
where he lies, and it is safe to say
that he will run far ahead of his
ticket in Marin Members of the bar
in the city are so well satisfied with
this nomination that they hae
formed a special organization for the
purpose of aiding in his election
The candidate is a natie of Cali
fornia, of Italian parentage As a
jurist he has few equals in the state
That he will run away ahead of his
ticket is a foregone conclusion
Amador county is expected to gie
him a substantial majority His
associate nominee, Lucien Shaw, of
Los Angeles, is also a strong candi
date, and in eery way worthy of
the solid support of his party
It is the running expenses of the
local goernment which hae helped
to cause the taxes to mount up from
$150 in 1888 and other years, to the
present rate of $195 This cause
has come about in face of an in
creased assessment roll of half a
million

A SAMPLE APPEAL
M  Uutler is an Englishman, the
son of a Cornish miner, and will speak
principally to the miners
We find the aboe statement on a
poster issued by the democratic
county central committee, announc
ing meetings for Jackson and Sutter
Creek at which Samuel Butler Esq,
was to be one of the speakers Why
Mr Butler's natiity and parentage
should be paraded in the poster can
only be surmised Of course there
was a definite and special object in
iew in so doing He is said to be a
labor union man from Grass Valley,
and it was thought that by bringing
him to Amador county to address
the miners, many of whom are
Cornish, his words would hae
greater weight because he claimed a
common birth place with them This
is another straw tending to show
the desperate' straights to which the
local democracy is reduced The
implication coneyed in that state
ment is an affront to eery English
born citizen Voters of this class
resent the idea that they can be led
like a flock of sheep by a glib talker
because he happens to claim a cer
tain spot of earth as his birthplace
We beg to inform these blundering
politicians that considerations of
this nature enter not into the make
up of their political faith Such
lowdown appeals are more apt to
repel than to attract them Citizens
of English birth will yield to none in
loe of natie land, but in matters
pertaining to the exercise of politi
cal rights i their adopted country
they will look with disfaor upon all
appeals that are not addressed to
them simply and solely as American
citizens The indiidual thus select
ed for this kind of missionary work
realized the hopelessness of such
methods, if his employers did not,
and discreetly kept mum about his
or his hearer's natiity from begin
ning to end of His speech
An Illegal Contract
? istrict Attorney 'C P Vicini in
timated in Sutter Creek at the demo
cratic meeting, that he had neer been
a party to the fleecing the county out
of $900 by recommending or sanctioning
an illegal contract, as be said had been
reported by one in the audience Now
the facts of the transaction referred to
are about as followsPersonal '"
In January, 1900, the board of super
isors of Amador county let a contract
to John A Brown to map for the use
of the assessor the 600 sections of land
in the county at $3 per section amount
ing to $1800 This act of tho board
was illegal, but in spite of that the
present district attorney, C P Vicini,
who is now seeking reelection, adised
said board that this mapping belonged
to the assessor's office The assessor
told the board he wanted the maps,
and did ot care who made them The
board then, upon the adice of the
district attorney, illegally let the con
tract for the mapmaking whichbe
longed to the sureyor's office The
law on the subject is as followsPersonal
Section 139 of the county goernment
act of 1897 readsPersonal The county sur
eyor shall plat, trace, blueprint, or
otherwise make all county, township,
road, district, and all other maps, and
all assessor's block books, for the
county of which he is sureyor
Also subdiision 12 of section 189 of
the same act, in fixing the compensa
tion of county officials, saysPersonal The sur
eyor, such fees as are now or may be
hereafter allowed by law; proided he
shall be gien all work for the county
in which the county employs one sur
eyor or ciil engineer
John A Brown sublet said map mak
ing to Geo I Wright, who made the
same, and was pleased at that time to
get the job At the time 4he board let
this illegal contract, they passed a
resolution that the maps should be
made under the general superision of
Übe county sureyor This was no
doubt for the purpose of pacifying the
sureyor for the diersion of the work
from his office The maps were made
and accepted and paid for by said
board, but without the approal or
consent of the county sureyor Mr
Wright and his assistants who made
said maps, receied for the same from
$900 to iIOOO  The maps are not worth
one cent more than Mr Wright re
ceied for them John A Brown in
diidually did not make a single plat
or map for which he had the contract
Where did the balance of $800 or 8900
go to? Presumably towards paying
part of John A Brown's shortage to
the county as assessor

A LAME PLEA
After long delay, and under the
pressure of public opinion, the is
patch and allied papers, came out
recently with an article in defense
of Judge Rust in leaing the county
during the summer of 1900, and other
times, mention of which absence h'us
been made seeral times in the Led
ger This defense, in short, is that
it is customary for the superior
court in all counties of the state to
take a acation during the summer
That the bar association of Araa
dor county, on the 30th day of June,
1900, presented a petition to the court
signed by all the members, request
ing the superior court to grant a
acation of six weeks, from July 20
to September 10,  1900 In compli
ance with said petition, a acation
was accordingly ordered Similar
action has been taken, on similar
petitions, both before and since 1900
This in brief is the plea in justifica
tion of the action of the judge of the
superior court in absenting himself
from the county during the critical
period of nearly two months in the
summer of 1900 It simply amounts
to a plea of guilty as charged oes
our cotemporary contend, will any
lawyer in town contend, that the
presentation of a petition by the
members of the local bar for a sum
mer acation, will justify a superior
judge — who is an officer in the era
ploy of the state, and whose duties
are clearly defined by law — io ab
senting himself from his office for
six weeks at one time The attor
neys comprising the bar were peti
tioning for themseles— not for the
salaried officers of the court They
merely asked that no cases should be
tried, or set for trial, during the
period coered by the acation
That their appeal for a acation
should be twisted into a release of
the judge also from his duties is the
wildest kind of logic It would be
just as reasonable to say that the
entire court — comprising judge, dis
trict attorney, sheriff and clerk— are
liberated from their sworn duties by
the same simple process The prop
osition is too absurd for discussion
It is uot true that superior judges i
other counties are accustomed to
absent themseles as was done here
in 1900 and at other times In cities
haing more than one super
ior, judge, and where the judges
are pressed with business all; the
time — which is not the case here — a
rest may be absolutely needed, but
neer is the city left without a su
perior judge ready to transact busi
ness In a county like Amador, it
is absolutely necessary for good go
ernment that the judge of the su
perior court be here, ready for the
transaction of business Indiidual
and property rights are, liable to
crop up at any time, and demand
immediate attention 'Let us see
what the law says on this question
Article VI sec 5 of the Constitu
tion of California saysPersonal
The superior court sha'l
be always open (legal holidays and non
judicial days excepted)
To make it still more emphatic, if
that were possible, the same idea is
incorporated in the codes Sec 73
of the code of ciil procedure readsPersonal
The superior courts shall be always
open (legal holidays and nonjudicial
days excepted) and they shall hold their
sessions at the county seats of the se
eral counties or cities and counties
respectiely
And yet in face of this obligation,
enthroned in the constitution and
reiterated in the codes, and accept
ed by eery superior judge "before
entering upon the duties of his office
with all the solemnity of an oath, we
are told that the law was iolated,
and has been iolated for years, be
cause the bar of Amador county
asked for a acation This line of
argument, pressed to its ultimatum,
means that the superior judge an
office created by law, and the officer
sworn to obey and enforce the law —
is himself superior to the law; that
to suit his conenience or pleasure,
he can suspend or nullify the pro
isions of the constitution, or of the
codes, or both, wheneer he sees fit
A proposition so reolting to com
mon sense it is needless to discuss
We will now state the facts In
July, 1900, the smallpox was raging
in Jackson The disease at that
time was regarded with tenfold
more terror than now People were
leaing by scores, and business was
paralyzed Moreoer a presidential
election was pending, and less than
a month remained in which persons
entitled to citizenship could get
naturalized in time to ote at that
election The sacred right of suffrage
was dependent upon the judge stay
ing at his post of duty The pres
ence of an appalling pestilence was
an additional reason why eery pub
lic official should remain with his

A Significant Straw
A small item has been brought to our
attention this week which is worthy of
entilation in these columns, as ser
ing to show how taxpayers are called
upon to boar needless expense The
matter, it is true, is a small one, and in
itsolf amoants to a mere trifle in the
affairs of goernment  The principle,
howeer, is of ital importance The
old saying; "Take care of the cents,
and the dollars will take care of them
seles, " is as true today as it was one
hundred years bacl? It is jusf as ap
plicable to "public affairs as to priate
affairsi An officer is bound to exorcise
the same economy in the transaction of
pnblic business as he does in his own
priate concerns There can be no
question as to the correctness and the
necessity of a rigid adherence to this
rule Wheueor a county officer,
whether for political or personal
reasons it mattors not, departs from
this line, it is time the taxpayers for
their own interests made a reision of
their employes Now eery oter dur
ing tho past week has receied through
tho mail a sample ballot The law re
quires tho county clerk to mail one to
eery oter before the election These
ballots, were" sent out in common
stamped enelopes; Issued by the
authorities at Washington They were
specially ordered through the local
postmaster, and something like 3500
wore required Of course it was a sa
ing of time to get them ready stamped,
as ta affix a one cent stamp on that
number of enelopes would consume
considerable time Besides which it
was cheaper The ready stamped
enelopes could be purchased for less
than tho enelopes and stamps could
hae been bought separately So far
so good But on the outside of these
enelopes was printed the official ad
dress of C L Culbert, as county clerk,
whichin itself was right and proper
This printing was , done in Amador
county, presumably at the ispatch
office, and the enelops were ordered by
the proprietor of the ispatch, who
was informed of the facts hereinafter
stated' by the local postmaster, but we
do not know whether the information
was communicated to the county clerk
himself It is in this little printing
job that tho sacrifice of the taxpayers'
interests comes in This printing done
in a local office, according to established
rates, cost about $10 or $12 Now it is
well known, that where a quantity of
enelopes are specially ordered from
tho postal department; the printin" of
tho address on tho outside can be done
without extra chargo Those enelopes,
therefore, might hae boon secured all
ready printed as well as stamped, for
the same price as without the print
ing Therefore the $10 or $12 in
curred for printing was so much money
thrown away It was a plum thrown
to the printer at the expense of tax
payers Would any sensible business
man act thus in the transaction of his
priate affairs? From the taxpayers
standpoiut it amounted to a free gift of
that much money from" the public
treasury Taxpayers hae been called
upon to pay onethird more than they
ought to hao paid For what? Is it
any wonder that the taxrate is on the
ascending scale when county funds are
tossed about in this reckless fashion
It is right and proper that printing
should bo done in tho county if pos
sible, • where no serious difference in
cost would be entailed If we mistake
not, howeer, the sample ballots them
seles were printed outside tho county
\\ hy? Certainly not because they
could not hae been printed equally as
well in the county The law requiring
all job printing to be done in the coun
ty if practicable, appears to hao been
wiped from the statute books in recent
years Neertheless the policy is a
wholesome one, and taxpayers will not
faor tho diersion of public business
to outside offices when the same might
hae been dono at the same price with
in the county The printing of the
ballots will cost at a rough estimate
oer $100 Some months ago affidaits
of registration were gotten outside the
county at a cost of something like $80,
if we remember rightly That work
might hao beon done for less money
at homo Is it not time for a change
when such things are taking place in
our midst

THE BIG RALLY IN AMAOR
The Largest Political Gathering Eer
Seen in the Town— An Enthusiastic
Audience
Saturday eening in Amador City
capped the record on the republican
side in this campaign Neer before
was such an immense gathering at a
political speaking seen in that burg
The isitojgfirom outside the ' county
were surprised at the turnout and" the
enthusiasm displayed It was remark
ed that in other parts of the state in a
town the "size of Amador an audience
of a couple of hundred would be con
sidered an excellent showing; whereas
there was considerably oer a thousand
flocked into Amador Saturday night
They came from ' eery part of tho
county It was not only the promi
nence of the speaker, Congressman Mc
Lachlan, that attracted them, but also
a determined, organized effort to make
this affair one of the most momorablein
point of numbers and enthusiasm It
was intended as a show of strength To
the efforts of the Sutter Creek and
Amador City Republican Club the suc
cess of the gathering was mainly due
J B Tregloan took the matter in
hand, and strainod eery nere, and
to his energy and personal attention to
eery detail, the gratifying result is
largely attributable Tho Jackson
and Plymouth bands were in attend
ance/ also the Oneida glee club and
Plymouth glee club added to theonter
tainment with campaign songs Tho
meeting was held in Taylor & Allen's
hall, which, thoqgb large, could not
hold onethird of the throng that
sought admittance John R Tregloan
called the meeting to order, and read a
long list of ice presidents, who were
requested to take seats on the platform
This list was a show of strength in
itself, inasmuch as it embraced the,
principal mining, business, and • pro
fessional men of the county Tho pres
ident of the meeting, S K Thornton,
superintendent of the Shenandoah
mine of Plymouth, was introduced,
and made a brief speech The county
candidates were next introduced, each
one making a short address touching
his own candidacy O E Martin, the
resident candidate for justice of the
peace, and T S Tuttle, nominee for
constable, also addressed the meeting
C H McKenney, i candidate for the
assembly, gae an able speech, fully
demonstrating his ability to look after
the interests of the district in the lower
branch of the state legislature
 W C Ralston, nominee for state
senator, spoke at some length, touch
ing his record in the last legislature
He "was in hia happiest ein, and his
remarks were greeted with frequent
bursts of applause
After another song by the glee club,
the speaker of the eening Congress
man MeLaehlai}, of Pasadena, address
ed the gathering His discussion of
national topics showed what the repub
lican party had done for the country;
how democracy had retarded its de
elopment wheneer it had been* gien
an opportunity to carry out its mis
chieous tenets It was a masterly
exposition of the issues of the campaign
from the republican side, and listened
to with breathless interest fr6m begin

THEAMAOE LEGERPersonal JACKSON, CALIFORNIA, FRIAY, OCTOBER 31 1902
The Interpretation Thereof
As a reply to the expose in last
week's Lodger of the official action in
the case of W H Lester, and also of
the charge of noncolltrtion of licenses
from the Morroll siiow company last
month, U S Gregory, as sheriff and
license collector has issued a circular,
and scattered the same broadcast oer
the county We quote the circular in
full, bo far as the explanation of these
transactions are concernedPersonal
In the Lester cattle stealing case —
the burden of the Ledger's song — one
of Allen's cattle was butchered in El
orado county and as the owner of the
cow lies in Amador county and helps
to pay my salary, and fearing the ras
cal might escape before the El orado
sheriff could reach the scene, I went
oer into El orado couuty and ar
rested the thief After his arrest I
discoered that part of the beef had
been brought into Amador county and
sold The law proides that where a
theft has been committed in one coun
ty and any part of the stolen property
has been brought into another county
and disposed of the offense is triable in
either county The man begged to be
gien a chance to plead guilty in this
county, probably knowing the feeling
against cattlo* thiees in El orado,
and fearing a more seere sentence
there; out of mercy for the poor un
fortunato fellow, I consented The dis
trict attorney aud superior judge knew
all the circumstances in connection
with the matter, and the man was
gien a fair and legal trial and sent to
San Queutin, whore he paid the penalty
for his crime and is now at large, i The
editor of the Lodger knows perfectly
well that the right of habeas corpus is
still in ogue, and if there was  any ir
regularity the conicted man could
hae aailed himself of his legal rights
and hae been released from prison at
any time The editor Of the Ledger
admits that the man who wrote tin;
letter in connection with the case is an
entire stranger to him, and still is will
ing to besmirch tha character of a pub
lic officer on such testimony I could
hae iuforined him that the fellow is
an irresponsible, worthless agabond,
if he had taken the pains to ask me,
and I do not think that any honorable,
upright man would charge an officer
with rongdoing upon such informa '
tion from such a source
As to the charge that no lk'euse was
collected from the Morrell Show Com
pany, it is a most unjustifiable mis
statement The company did not
leae the county until the 4th of
October and settled with me at that
time Had the editor of the Ledger
been fair and honorable ho would hae
ascertained the truth by coming to my
office and seeing the stub forthelicense
which was paid after my settlement,
which was made on the Ist of October,
aud which will be paid into the county
treasury i my next quarterlysettla
ment The  fact that since my as
sumption of the duties of license col
lector that I hae collected and paid
into the treasury of Amador county
more than double as much as any other
license collector eer did in a like per
iod of time, should be a complete
answer to this malicious falsehood
U S Gregory
We gie place to the aboe, not at
the request of Mr Gregory, but of our
own free motion, and for the purpose
of showing the hollowness of tho ex
planation It is no explanation at all;
indeed, it brings into stronger relief if
possible, the damaging facts of the Les
ter case, as sot forth in the Ledger last
week by our correspondent Let it be
admitted that the law proides that
where personal property is stolen in
ono county, ami afterwards remoed,
in whole or i part, into another coun
ty, the case may be tried in either
county Mr 'Gregory says that he dis
coered* that part of the beef was
brought iuto Amador couuty and sold
That fact is not al'eged in the com
plaint, nor is it proen or stated in any
manner in the records of the case
Why was this fact kept in the back,
ground Who bought the stolen prop
erty Why was he, to, not prosecuted
as a party to the criminal transaction
Section 4i)tj of the penal code readsPersonal
j Eery person who for his own gain,
or to preent the owner from again
possessing his proporty, buys or re
ceies any personal property, knowing
the same to hae been stolen, is pun
ishable by imprisonment in tho state
prison not exceeding fie years, or in
the county jail not ;• exceeding six
months
j Now, ono of the main points in our
correspondent's lbttor was that the
railroading of Lester to state prison in
the uncerinoniou* fashion adopted, was
the means of allowing an accomplice in
crime in Amador county to go unpun
ished Not a syllable is ouchsafed in
entillation of this ital point How
came it that the ono in Amador county
was not molested, but the El orado
man yanked into Amador county, and
sent to state prison at a24ogalt "The
man begged to be gien a chance to
plead guilty in this county," and so
compassion came to the rescue of tho
poor unfortunate, and he got two years
for a crime without any extenuating
circumstances that we can see, the
punishment for which is from one to
ten years It is admitted that he would
probably hae got a much heaier
sentence in El orado county That is
$ho way the cattlemen of Amador coun
ty, who holp to pay the sheriff s salary,
are protected, and why the Ei orado
authorities were not allowed to attend
to tho case The culprit gets almost a
minimum of punishment, and the cost
aid odium of a  crime that properly
belongs to El orado, are thrown upon
Amador county
But again Tho record shows that
U S Gregory was the only witness in
this remarkable case Ho made the
complaint, be took the stand, and the
man was held to answer on his bare
testimony He was at least thirty
miles away from the scene of tho crime
What eidence— other than hearsay^
could he gie touching the essential
facts constituting the crime; such as
tho actual killiug, the ownership of the
cow Is this the correct precedent to
establish in criminal procedure But
the most amazing, gieaway state
ment of all is this; "The district at
torney and superior judge knew all the
circumstances in connection with the
matter" How did they know? How
could they know, except by the sworn
testimony of ' eye witnesses to the
material facts? There was no • testi
mony introduced in tho superior court,
and the eidenco of U S Gregory in the
preliminary examination was not re
duced to writing What, then, does
he mean when tie aays, Tho district at
torney and superior judge knew all the
circumstances? We leae our readers
to sole that conundrum oes this
not sere to proe, what the Ledger
has contended for from the outset, that
it is high time that this political com
bine was jlissoled b y t* 16 decree of
the oters registered at the ballQtbox
To cap the whole,' the people are told
that If illegally conicted, Lester had
a remedy by habeas corpus What of
it? oes that excuse excess of author
ity on the part of an officer? Lester
was not kicking He was chuckling
oer his good fortune in being run into
Amador county to get a term of two
years for a crime of great enormity in
the the eyes of all cattlemen — namely,
cattle stealing We hao yet to hear
from the cattle men how thoy relish
this merciful interention by Amador
authorities in behalf of one caught in
ery act of preying upon their business
interests  The personal flings at tho
editor of tho Ledger we deem unworthy
of notice Also, the hard names hurled
with/ questionable taste at our corre
spondent, A Maron, we pass by in si
lence But to set at rest all insinuations
as to the correctness of the facts, wo
herewith publish, a certified copy of the
record in the justico's courtPersonal

H GOLNKR,
Justice of the peace in and for said township
I hereby certify that the withiu Is a true
copy of my docket H Goldner
Now, about the show licenses, which
he says were collected after Oct 1 and
will be reported in the next quarterly
statement Section 9of the licenso or
dinance readsPersonal _,
Wheneer tho rate of license tax by this ordin
ance imposed is fixed at a sum for a quarter of
a year, or any other period, the liceuse tax for
the whole of such quarter of a year, or other
period, must be paid in adance
Another part of the ordinance fixes
the license for show as followsPersonal 
For traeling minstrels, shows, traeling dra
matic or theatrical performances  * ja'so i>er
day, or $10 per week  
How comes it that this pay in adance
proision — so essential to the itality of
the ordinauce — is no longer regarded
as obligatory The license tax that
should hae been collected f rom the
Morrell company alone boforo Oct 1,
amounted to $40 at the weekly rate,
and considerably more at the day rate
And yet not a dollar was reported for
the whole quarter preceding October 1
Why were th» interests of the county
jeopardized by a deliberate departure
from the law for the benefit of outside
license payers? To gie the same ratio
of concession to resident business men
liquorllicenses would hae to be collect
ed yearlyafter each indiidual had run
up a bill of $b"0 due the county Of
course after this entilation, the' show
licenses referred to will figure* in the
pext statement We were under the
impression that the Morrell company
played in lono seeral times after Oct
4' Wo could gie tho reasons why re
enue from licenses has increased It is
due to increase of busiuess houses and
businesses subject to license Citizens
will conclude that where such looseness
preails as herein indicated, the fullness
of time has come to make a change
Attempted Suicide
A man named William Parsons was
taken to the hospital on Wednesday by
J Tonzi of near Mount Echo He was
suffering from a selfinflicted wound in
tho throat, made with suicidal iutent
It seems that Parsons was formerly a
resident of near Amador City Some
years ago he held a responsible position
at the Kennedy mine Latterly he had
been working at the copper mine at
Camp Soco He left there three weeks
ago,"and was journeying toward Ama
dor City It is reported that he had
been drinking heaily, and this was
the cause of his attempt upon * his own
life He was found wandering around
below Amador, between Amador City
and rytown, with his thrqat cut, and
in a kind of dazed condition The
wound had no doubt been inflicted se
eral days before When able to
contMse, he told his attendants that
he had used a razor to 'do the work;
that he wanted to get out of the world
anyway, as he had lied long enough
The windpipe was entirely seered,
but fortunately tho jugular oin was
not touched Had that ein boon cut
he would hae bled tq death in a few
seconds When brought" to the hos
pital ho was ery weak from exposure,
lack of nourishment and loss of blood
r Gall promptly attended to his
wounds It required" 16 stitches to
close the cut The windpipe also had
to be stitched to its place The ictim
is by no means out of danger, as the
windpipe is njuch slower in uniting
and healing than ordinary tissue
Parsons, notwithstanding his weakened
condition, displayed great nere under
tho operation He was so reduced in
strength, that it was deemed danger
ous to administer chloroform So the
wounds were stitched without any
anaesthetic whateer, tho patient
scarcely flinching under thc pajnfp}
operation  •

EMOCRATIC RALLY
A I Qua^et Personal of Speakers '„ Furnish _ Personal Oratory
I for son • and ~ Butter Creek 0 the i
'  ' Same  Right ' < i\
The democrats made an extra effort
Tuesday night for a big "rally in; both
Jackson atfd Sutter Creek They; ;had
to" do somethingto offset' the fact' that
Lane, their nominee for goernor, had
gien Amador county tho" goby, while
Pardee' had taken the trouble^to get
away from the railroad line, and isit
Jackson So they arranged a double
meeting for Jackson and Sutter Creek
the same night, with four talkers who
were to alternate between^ the two
towns The orators announced fur tho
occasion were James V Personal Cpleman, a
wheelhorse  of ; democracy, Samuel
Butler,' whuwas "billed as a member of
tho miners', uniou, also an' "Euglish
;aau, the son of a Cornish miner, who
would speak principally to tho minors"
Also Thomas J Geary," former con
gressman, and author of the Geary
Chinese, exclusion bill, rand? hist of all
L R Tiillooh, nominee for state sen
ator Bonfires, the booming of guns,
tho Jackson baud, and eery effort
was made to awaken some enthusiasm
Thero was a fairsized crowd gathered
onPersonalth'Bstrt?ot,"tho hall was well filled';
but nothing' like the  mass of people
that greeted some ol the republican
turnouts at Jackson and Amador City
There were few persons 'from "outside
the town noticed in the crowd
James Moohan was selected as chair
man' Half a dozen icepresidents oc
cupied 1 seatsPersonal on the platform The
first speaker was Samuel Butler of
Neada county, who is said to be presi
dent of the miners' union there, and
whose isit ; hero was  intended to in
lluencetho miners of this region to a
faorable 'regard ; for the democratic
cause He is a' 'commonplace " talker,
monotonous in his style, ' and Personal with no
claims to eloquence or oiiutory;  His
address was simply a statement of his
campaign experience,' and' a sketch' of
Lane He showed commonsense in
omitting all reference to his being an
Englishman, and ukuUJ no mention of
the Cornish miner, as he was ei
dently exuected 10 do by the demo
cratic managers He' was no doubt
much* better posted on tho character of
these miners than the politicians were,
and knew that any 'claim of influence
oer them by reason of natiity would
bo resented He said the laboring men
were interested in the campaign more
than any other class, j It was a cam
paign of local issuos, the main issue
being the liberty of the working man
to organize for his own protection Ho
forgot to say tliut no ' party aud" no
candidate has uii; taken the negatie
of that proposition, •H e said ne was
glad to be informed that the miners of
Amador county had at 'last organized
for their own protection, thereby refut
ing his own statement that the right to
organize was an issue in the contest
He wished God speed to the miners'
union of Jackson He  had seen the
benefits of industrial organization " He
made the broad assertion that there
was not a solitary Chinaman in tho
city of Tacoma owing to the opposition
of Franklin K Lane 1 ' Mr Bullor is
not particular about the truth He
further said that Pardee was an enemy
to the laboring man, and rehashed a
lot of lies about the railroad strike
years ago, Butler's talk from begin
ning to end was' an effort to stir up
class prejudice; to array the employes
against the employers; to represent
that their interests are and must be
antagonistic; and that it was necessary
for the laboring raau to keep on a war
fooling as it were by organizing against
>he employers He appealed  to the
miners that whateer the action, of
those aboe them might be, to stand"
firm' Just fancy the gall of the man
agers of the democratic party, in their
desperation to hold on to the local of
fices, in importing men to Amador
couuty to talk in this strain to intelli
gent working men, Personal '
Jas V Coleman was the next speaker,
and he eidently was not faorably im
pressed with the remarks of his prede
cessor, as he started out by saying that
•he thought it was a mistake to diide
people iuto two classes — laborers and
capitalists or employers He talked
against  the modern  king called
monopoly The democratic party was
not opposed to combinations of capital
It is the party of progress Its policy
was well rounded, while the republican
policy was lopsided The danger was
in icious combinations • The demo
cratic, party proposed to deal een
handed justice to all, so that there
should be no more strife The reolution
will be aucompllshod peacefully, and
the settlement will bo for all time He
claimed that the democracy was the
friend of the people, and republicanism
the friend of trusts and the foo of the
people '
Thos J Geary, excongressman, was
next called The people had to wait
for some time, until he could get here
from Sutter Creek, and the band
played, and Cpleman afterward started
in to toll a dream to consume the time,
in the midst of which the speaker put
in an appearance Geary is a man of
considerable intellectual force He
made by far the ablest speech from a
democratic standpoint heard in the
county in this campaign Ho discussed
the tariff, and maintained  that the
democratic party is not a free trade
party, neer was, and neer will be
It was not the enemy of industry, and
did not propose to do anything to inter
fere with the prosperity of the present
time Ho claimed that American goods
could be bought much cheaper in
foreign countries, than in the United
States, and from this reaspnod that the
protectie tariflf was unnecessarily high
They proposed to take the duty off of
trust' made goods, and the necessaries
of life, leaing what are called luxuries
to bear the burden of furnishing
reenue He told his hearers that the
working men would neer hae a better
friend than the democratic party; that
it would neer desert them, but failed
to shpw at any time that tho policy of
the democrats had eer resulted in
good times and prosperity
The meeting closed with an address
by L R Tulloch, candidate for state
senatorPersonal To say that he astonished
his hearers is putting it mildly  His
wild and incoherent talk was utterly
unintelligible If he had the least Idea
pf what he was talking ' about, his
listeners certainly did not The audi
ence was giggling from beginning to
end of his harangue because of tho ab
sence of a clearcut idea It was really
pitiable

lates to something the indiidual
dreads more than anything else in the
\rcrld There is the germ of fatal
thought in ninetynine persons in eery
hundred, and the exception Is  only
proof against the thought disease by
haing been inoculated with the lymph
of optimism or philosophy' "
| The idea that one has some incipient
disease in one's system, the thought of
fliituiciil ruin, that one is getting on hi
life without iuiproiqg prospects — any
of ' them or a thousand similar
thoughts may carry a healthy man to
a premature • grae A melancholy
thought that fixes itself upon one's
mind needs as much "doctoring" as
physical disease It needs to be eradi
cated from the mind or It will hae
just the same result as a neglected
disease  would hae The thought dis
ease sometimes cures Itself after run
ning its course; so does smallpox But
who would settle down to suffer from
smallpox and chance recoery, as thou
sands of foojish persons settle down to
let the tßought disease, which has at
tacked them, do Its worst?
Eery melancholy thought, eery
morbid notion and eery nagging wor
ry should be resisted to the utmost,
and the patient should be physicked by
Iphecrful thoughts, of which there is a
store in 'eery one's possession, bright
eomiKiniorifc— cheaper than drugs and
pleasanter  
 ' There hae occurred scores of dozens
of oases where healthy persons hae
thought themseles into haing rumors
and cancers— cases which admit of no
doubt whateer that the diseases re
sulted from constant morbid fear
There might possibly be fewer cases
of cancer if some great doctors could
assure tho world that it is not a hered
itary disease, but morbid minded per
sons on hearing that there Is cancer in
their families generally jdo the ery
worst thing they can <lo under the cir
cumstances — they conceie an awful
dread that they will be afflicted with
it JThey dwell upon the fear constantly,
aud eery trifling aliment which trou
ble's them is at first mistaken for the
premonitory symptoms of cancer
The morbid condition of mind pro
duces a morbid condition of body, and
if the disease does happen to be in the
system it receies eery j encourage

POULTRY POINTERS
The best eggs are the result of a
meat diet
Weak legs come from forced growth,
high feeding and close confinement
 Use no deformed or weak fowls for
breeding and do not keep the same
cock more than one season
A molting hen seldom lays She can
not, be supplying eggs while the strain
of growing new feathers is upon her
A ery fat hen seldom lays anything
but soft shelled eggs Apoplexy and
egg bound are the result of excessie
fat
Leaes and hay chaff make excellent
litter for the floors, and by throwing
grain among it  fowls are often kept
busy scratching
Keep the fowls away from the barns,
stables and carriage houses In such
places they are nuisances; besides they
are more comfortable In a place by
themseles
liens must hae carbonate and phos
phate of lime for' their shells, and these
will be found in old plastering, broken
oyster shells and bones, with some of
the meat and'gristle attached
A Persian inner

sists of a fowl boiled to rags, surround

boiled eggs, fried onions, almonds and
raisins There Is a Shiraz wine, clear,
golden red liquid that has traeled
oer the mountain passes on muleback
in a huge glass carboy Among the
dessert manna has a conspicuous place
This delicacy is somewhat akin to
nougat; it is studded with walnuts and
almonds and is jaw I sticking to the
last degree Like the mango, it ls best
eaten in priate, for it renders the mas
ticator speechless It is made of gum
that exudes from a tree and is said to
bo engendered by a worm"— Chleago
