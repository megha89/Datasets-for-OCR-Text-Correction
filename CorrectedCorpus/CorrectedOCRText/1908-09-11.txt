THE NEW TX SCHEME
The mos imporan measure, in he shape of a proposed
consiuional amendmen, o be oedupon a he elecion in
Noember is senae consiuional amendmen No i proid
ing for he reform of axaion in California The measure
o be submied o he decision of he ballo box is he ou
come of years of careful inesigaion and hough besowed
upon he subjec by a special commission appoined for ha
purpose, upon he recommendaion of he hen goernor,
George C Pardee  copy of his proposed amendmen will
be forwarded o eery regisered oer in ample ime o gie
an opporuniy o horoughly sudy is proisions Is
mam feaure is he separaion of sae and local axaion
Public uiliy corporaions, such as railroads, ligh and power
companies, elegraph and elephone lines, seamboa and
• sage lines, insurance companies, commercial and saings
banks, rus companies, ec, are o be assessed for sae pur
poses only, while all oher forms of propery are lef for he
suppor of he local goernmen Eery propery holder is,
or should be, deeply ineresed in his exremely radical de
parure from exising mehods of proiding reenue for he
mainenance of no only sae and couny goernmens, bu
municipaliies as well I is likely ha some of he ciy
goernmens will be he mos affeced by he proposed change,
alhough his phase of he quesion has been gien lile a
enion so far In piesenee of he pendency of such a mo
menous issue, s surprising ha ciizens manifes such
apahy in qualifying hemseles o oe by geing on he
grea regiser Properyholders especially who neglec o
enroll on he oiug lis in ime, will be kicking hemseles
a few weeks hence when he impor of his drasic change
begins o dawn upon hem
Elsewhere in his issue we publish a communicaion from
he sae board of equalizaion, in which he wrier conends
ha he raificaion of his proposed amendmen will affec a
maerial reducion of he burdeu of axaion in mador
couny, and ha for his reason he Ledger should urge upon
he people he adisabiliy of oiug for i We may sae
ha he Ledger aricle which called forh his communicaion
from he secreary of he sae board, wherein we urged he
necessiy of changes in he laws which would work a reduc
ion of axes for local purposes, had no reference o his pro
posed consiuional amendmen We referred o  cerain
changes ha migh be made in laws specially affecing his
couny, such as a reision of lie fee schedule of he superior
cour and couny officers, he diersion of commissions ou he
sale of propery under order of he cours from priae poc
kes ino he couny reasury, he wiping ou of all exra
compensaion of couny officers ouside of heir fixed salaries,
he repeal of he salary law for ownship officers, which has
proed effecie only in piling up burdens upon he axpay
ers; he reform of he road sysem, aking he managemen
of he roads ou of he hands of he superisors By ju
dicious changes in hese respecs, and sric economy in ex
penses, we do no hesiae o say ha he ax rae for all
couny purpose migh be cu down o less han $i on he
$ioo as he assessmen roll now sands, whereas i now fluc
uaes slighly around he $150 mark
Neerheless, if he proposed consiuional amendmen
holds ou relief in his direcion, i should be carefully con
sidered In some counies he measure is being srongly op
posed on he ground ha i would increase raher han de
crease he local ax rae lii such counies he assessmen
roll, we presume, is heaily charged wih ha class of cor
porae propery ha would be wihdrawn from he jurisdic
ion of he local assessor In mador couny, we are inclined
o hink he claim ha he effec of he new reenue plan
would proe beneficial is correc From an examinaion of
he assessmen roll we find ha in he neighborhood of one
million dollars worh of propery would be sricken from he
ax roll dd o his he loss of reenue by he lopping off
of all couny licenses now imposed upon hese corporaions,
he loss would be equal o he wihdrawal of one and a half
millions from he axable propery  0 cens on he $100,
his would amoun o $6000 per year ha mador propery
under he new sysem would conribue for he suppor of
MOR LEGE JCKSOf, CLIFORNI,
he sae goernmen Compare his wih he sum we are
now comribuing under he exising sysem Puing he
assessmen roll in round numbers a $y  million dollars, a
0 Cens on he $100 — he lowes in he hisory of he sae —
his would yield a reenue of $22,500 So ha he difference
so far as mador couny is concerned beween he old and
he proposed new reenue sysem is equal o a saing of a
leas beween $15,000 and $16,000 per year o he couny
reasury True, his loss of sae income mus be made good
by oher localiies differenly siuaed on his proposiion
 any rae, his secion has nohing o lose, bu much o
gain, from he adopion of his proposed consiuional amend
men From he municipal sandpoin of ho ciy of Jackson
i would ake away some sources of reenue, and gie nohing
in reurn Bu his a small maer, and no worhy of seri

There were oher journeys o

wih him for fie minues, I suddenly
askedPersonal "Bu wha name did he

"My dear sir," he replied, "I hae

Foryeigh eminen mericans,

"roorioa," no answered, "would

"WJml; is mean by he conseraion
of naural resources?" 1 asked,
"i'ha bo wase and improper use of

greaes of all alues he firs selors

he rich counry from Maryland o

"How do foress preen floods?" I
asked
"When {here is n rain on he prair
ies he waer fulls direcly on he

renches, carrying considerable of

howeer, rain does no fall direcly

down he runks, drips from he

There is no iolence, you see, as on

gallons of water and 20,000 pounds of
coal. Under him is 200,000 pounds
of engine, and behind there Is
000,000 pounds of train. Altogether he
Is running along ahead of 800,000
pounds of steel, hardwood and brass
held to an eighty pound rail by three
quarters of an inch of wheel flange.
"Why, when one of those big Rus
sian battleships fired a broadside at
the Japanese the whole thing
amounted only to 24,000 pounds, so the
papers say. And that 24,000 pounds
traveling eight miles a minute would
strike a Japanese ship eight miles

of the force we hit the empties at

"Of course I was the engineer and
they depended on me. There is al
ways a lot of fine talk about engineers
having the lives of several hundred
passengers In their hands. That's all
very true, but you don't want to over
look tho fact that the engineer's life
Is right there along with the others.
We all take chances, the train crew
as well as the passengers, only our
chances are slimmer, I had one
chance iv 000 of being killed, or one in
twenty-five of getting right where 1
am now, but a passenger on the train
hnd one chance In about 3,000,000 of
being killed and one in 130.000 of
being hurt.
"I see that n lot of people were Ullleil
and a whole lot more hurt. I don't
want to bo n grumbler, but it appears
to me that you fellows have kinder
overlooked the fact that both of my
legs are gone. Of course that might
not mean much to you, but If you
realized, as I do, that for tho rest of
my life it Is going to bo my job to
hobble out into the middle of some
country road and wave a white flag as
every train goes by— if you could real
ize what that means to an engineer
to hear the mocking toot of the whis
tle as she comes up to the crossing and
to sei> the sympathetic salute of tho
engineer and fireman as they go flying
D y_l tell you, my boy, there are some
