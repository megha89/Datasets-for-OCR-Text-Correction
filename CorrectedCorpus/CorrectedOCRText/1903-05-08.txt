RESEN CHINA
First Offered For Sale tit the Fnlr
of lidpslo In 1721
resden china began Its reign at tho
fair of I/elpstc, 1721, where It was of
fered for public sale for the first time
It has had three periods— King's, Slar
collne and modern— aud for all around
use It continues to be the most popular
ware of thlß day
The factory marks traced on the bot
tom of each piece ary according to the
period— the oldest (King's) being (lie
monogram A B and the wand of 53s
culoplus The familiar crossed swords,
with the dot or circle between the ban
dies, were first used In 1721, and the
star took the place of the dot in tlie
Marcolliie period The modern mark Is
the simple crossed swords, sometimes
accompanied by letters and numbers
Although the methods of work are
still Jealously guarded In all factories,
the essentials are an open seiret, and
the following rough outline niny satis
fy the lazily curiousPersonal The ingredients
of porcelain are kaolin feldspar, sand
and selenite These are ground tine and
mixed In Umewater Tho paste Is then
molded Into forms and fired in an oen
of moderate heat When taken out, it
is i an opaque state aud is then dipped
in the glaze, which Is feldspar ground
fine, with a little alkali It is now sub
jected to a firing of great heat which
results' In the beautiful polished sur
face so familiar the world oer 
This Beeond firing Is attended with
risk, for if the piece Is allowed to re
main beyond the exact proper moment
the whole melts together and Is ruined
Hor a Glaits Ere Aclx
A glass eye has neer so free a range
of moement as the real one, and when
the owner turns his eyes strongly in
any direction the glass eye lags behind
the other, so producing a squint Then
the pupil of the glass eye is of course
of a fixed size, while the natural pupil
dilates and contracts not only with
arying amounts of light, but with
arying emotions Then again the
white of the eye aries in lint greatly
from day to day, being slightly blood
shot during headaches and yellow dur
ing bilious attacks The differences in
color between the two eyes caused by
these changes are een more easily no
ticed than the differences in the pupils
The Camel's Bite
The camel alone of all ruminants has
Incisor teeth in the upper jaw, which,
with the peculiar structure of his other
teeth, make his bite, the animal's first
and main defense, most formidable
The skeleton of the camel is full of
proofs of design Notice, for example,
the arched backbone, constructed in
such a way as to sustain the greatest
weight in proportion to the span of the
supports A strong camel can bear a
thousand pounds weight although the
usual load in Yemen Is not more than
600 pounds

Perfect Respiration
 For perfect respiration two things
are necessary— chest capacity an 6
breath control The aerage indiidual,
woman especially, uses but a limited
portion of the lungs and upper chest
In ordinary breathing  Wheneer a
little unusual physical effort makes de
mand for an extra breathing capacity,
note how she puffs and pants, almost
to a point of gasping Tho reason for
this Is that the muscles of the lower
chest, waist and abdomen hae become
well nigh atrophied through neglect
and abuse They are stiff and unre
sponsie and hae now to be coaxed
back to a condition of actiity and
obedience
It Is quite as possible to educate
these muscles so thut they shall re
spond to our slightest demand as It Is
that our hands are trained to do our
bidding ifferent teachers will ado
cate different forms of breathing—up
per chest, side chest, lower chest and
abnormal breathing— but " what we
most want ' Is absolute control, such
control of the iauscles as shall enable'
us to make use of any desired form of
breathing at the word of command, for
all forms hae special alues Full up
per chest breathing Is used most, but
lower chest and abdominal breathing
are ery aluable in cases of nerous
ness, indigestion, stomach and bowel
troubles
An Old nectpe
Here is a recipe for the bite of a mafl
dog taken from the "Uniersal Maga
zine of Knowledge,", published by John
Hlnton at the King's Arms in Newgate
street, London, May, 1753Personal "Take the
youngest shoots of the elder tree, peel
oil the outside rind, then, scraping off
the green j rind, take two handfuls of
It, which simmer a quarter of an hour
In fie pints of ale Strain It off and
when cold put It in bottles Take
half a pint, make warm the first thing
In the morning and the last at night
and be sure to keep yourself warm;
also buthe the part affected with some
of the liquor warmed, the dose to be
repeated the next new or full moon
after the first It Is good for cattle as
well as the human species"
Whims of a Horse
The better the horse the nipre spirit
he has The disposition of an Arab
hunter Is thus described by Sewell
Ford In "Horses NinePersonal" No paragon,
howeer, was Pasha He had a tem
per, and his whims were as many as
those of a schoolgirl He was particu
lar as to who put on his bridle He had
notions concerning the manner In
which a currycomb should be used A
red ribbon or a bandanna handkerchief
put him In a rage, while green, the holy
color of the Mohammedan, soothed his
neres A liely pair of heels he had,
and he knew how to use his teeth
Animals In Fire
When Cyprus was the center of the
copper Industry, it is asserted that a
four footed animal with wings lied in
the hottest furnaces among the tire and
Tnriiicriore'Tnat rrwoura are nistnunjr
upon being remoed from Its natural
clement, the flames The salamander
of old was also a creature which did
not dread the fire Some say that It
could eat fire and spit flames, others
that Its breath would Ignite all combus
tibles Pliny says, "This animal is bo
Intensely cold as to extinguish fire by
its contact in the same way that ice
doth" ;
Litigants' Requisites
An old English solicitor used to say
a man's requirements for going to law
were ten in number, and he summed
them up as followsPersonal First, plenty of
money; secondly, plenty of patience;
thirdly, a good case; fourthly, a good
solicitor; fifthly, plenty of money;
sixthly, a good counsel; seenthly, a
good witness; eighthly, a good Jury;
ninthly, a good Judge; tenthly, plenty
of money

KNOWING TOO MUCH
Some Serious rawbacks to the
Pleasures of Conersation
One ery serious drawback to our
pleasure l conersation with a too
well informed person is the nerous
strain that Is inoled We are always
wondering what will happen when he
comes to the end of his resources Aft
er listening to one who discourses with
surprising accuracy upon any particu
lar topic we feel a delicacy In changing
the subject It seems a mean trick,
like suddenly remoing the chair on
which a guest is about to sit down for
the eening; With one who is interest
ed In a great many things he knows
little about there Is no such difficulty
If he lias passed the first flush of
routh It no longer embarrasses him to
be 'caught now and then in a mistake
Indeed an r correction >a »r t ijyinwt w

as a starting point for a new series of
obserations
The pleasure of conersation Is en
hanced if one feels assured not only ol
wide margins of Ignorance, but also of
the absence of any uncanny quickness
of mind
I should not like to be a neighbor to
a wit It would be like being In prox
imity to a lie wire A certain Insulat
ing film of kindly stupidity is needed
to gie a margin of safety to human in
tercourse There are certain minds
whose processes coney the impression
of alternating currents of high oltage
on a wire that Is not quite large enough
for them From such I would with
draw myself
One is freed from all such apprehen
sions In the companionship of people
who make no pretensions to any kind
of cleerness "The laughter of fools
Is like the crackling of thorns under a
pot" What cheerful sounds— the crack
ling of the dry thorns and the merry

SAILOR AN HORSE
Bow tne Retired Sea Captain Mode
a Purchase
In "Hones Nine" Sewell fford tells
how a retired sea captain bought a
horse The story runsi Aa ono who In
spects an unfamiliar object Captain
Bean looked dazedly at Barnacles At
the same time Barnacles inspected the
captain With head lowered to knee
leel, with ears cocked forward, nos
trils sniffing and under lip twitching
almost as It he meant to laugh, Bar
nacles eyed his prospectie owner
Captain Bean squirmed under the
gaze of Barnacles' big, calm eye for a
moment, and then shifted his position
"What In time does he want any
way, Jed?" demanded the captain
"Wants to git acquainted, that's all,
cap'n Mighty knowin' hoss, he Is
Now, some hosses don't take notice of
anything They're Jest naturally dumb
Then ag'ln you'll flnd hosses that seem
to  hnow  TCTy * blamed" ir?rd "ywtt " Baf 
Them's the kind of hosses that's wuth
hain'"  
"S'pose he knows all the ropes, Jed?'
"I should say he did, cap'n If there's
anything that hoss ain't done in his
day, I don't know what 'tis Ncar*s I
can find out he's tried eery kind of
work, in or out of traces, that <yon
could think of"
"Must be some old by your tell," sug
gested the captain "Sure his timbers
are all sound?"
"unno 'bout his timbers, cap'n, but
as fer wind an' limb you won't find a
Bounder hoss of his age Jn this county
Course I'm not seIUV him fer a four
yearold"
Again Captain Bean tried to look
critically at the white horse, but once
more he met that calm, curious gaze,
and the attempt was hardly a success
Howeer, the captain squinted solemn
ly oer Barnacles' withers and re
markedPersonal
"Yes, he has got some good lines, as
you say, though you wouldn't hardly
call him clipper built Not much sheer
forward an' a leetle too much aft, eh?"
"At this criticism Jed snorted mirth
fully
"Oh, I s'pose he's all right," quickly
added the captain "Fact is I ain't
neer paid much attention to horses,
beln* on the water so much You're
sure he'll mind his helm, Jed?"
"Oh, he'll go where you pint him"
"Won't drag anchor, will he?'
"Stand all day if you'll let him"
"Well, Jed, I'm ready to sign arti
cles, I guess"
ORIGIN OF OL SAYINGS
The Honeymoon— For thirty days
after a wedding the ancient Teutons
had a custom of drinking a mead made
of honey
The Bridegroom— ln primitie times
the newly wedded man had to wait

Scandinaian Caring
From earliest times caring has re
ceied great attention In Scandinaia
One sees eidence of this in many Swe
dish churches, both in wood and stone,
dating back many centuries In Stock
holm are many to be found, now safe
ly cared for In a well known museum
Some of these northern churches, nota
bly those of Borgund and Hitterdal,
are quite coered with such quaint or
namentation Beyond such public ex
pression of painstaking labor one may
see In almost any comfortably furnish
ed house wooden forks, spoons, salt
boxes and platters, but still more at
tracting attention are huge wooden
tankards, and these will often bear
close study both in design and in exe
cution
Red Flannel Currency
A Scotch missionary to a group of
small islands in the south Pacific a
great many years ago found bits of red
flannel circulating as money This cur
rency came to them in a curious man
ner The body of a shipwrecked sailor
had^Qrif ted ashore, and to the untu
tored saages, who had neer before
seen clothing of any kind, his red flan
nel shirt was an object of wonder and
admiration By common consent they
cut the garment Into small pieces,
which thenceforth became the curren

The Truthful Pioneer
"One* day," said the truthful pioneer, 1
"I was whacking up some wood, down
by the creek, and ten Indians loome/j
up They were pretty thirsty een for
Indians, and they said they knew I
had a jug somewhere, and they want
ed to sample It I had a log about half
split at the time, and the ax was stick
ing In it I told them If they would
help me get that log in two I would
show them where the jug was So> they
took hold, fie on one side and fie on
the other, and pulled And wfcen I
took the ax out the log sprung together
and held them all by the fingers,' Then
I walked away to the house and} loaded
the shotgun and three or four pistols
and then went back and argued with
them, and they reformed right away"

The TFlld Giraffe
Perhaps the most difficult of all wild
animals to capture Is the giraffe In
addition to being ery rare giraffes are
exceedingly timid and are ery swift
footed There is no special way to cap
ture a giraffe, as almost eery way has
been tried, and all hae been almost
equally unsuccessful The method which
has occasionally resulted In a capture
Is by using a long cord, at each end of
which la a round weight This cord is
thrown by the hunter in such a manner
as to wind round the animal's legs,
either bringing It to the ground or ren
dering it incapable of escaping before
it is made a prisoner Most of the
giraffes in captiity hae been caught
by chance when young
Loemaklnar In Mexico
In northwest Mexico the courting Is
all done by the lady The young people
meet at the feasts, and there the dam
sel who has fixed upon a member of
the opposite sex whom she wishes to
become her husband tries to attract his
attention by dancing before him, per
sistently keeping her back turned to
ward him Eentually she may sit
down near him and pull his blanket
and sing to him in a gentle, low oice
When she desires to bring matters to a
focus, she begins to throw pebbles at
the chosen one If he throws them
back at her, they are betrothed
Eye* With ouble Pnpila
Cicero says that "the glance of all
women with the double pupil In the eye
Is noxious, blighting and withering"
Cadmus tells us that such persons
would not drown Still others say that
if they did drown the body would ne
er sink, neither wqnld it decay They
could cure the disease of the chest
consumption—by rubbing their perspi
ration on the affected parts of the indi
idual, and in case the double pupils
were red instead of black they could
cure the lepers and the blind

Queer African Mask
Grotesque masks are worn in many
parts of Africa during dances and reli
gious  ceremonies The reason Is be
cause a symbolic significance Is at
tached to them and they are especially,
supposed to possess the power of pre
sering those who wear them from the
Influence of eil spirits
The masks are generally made 'of
wood, and some are cared with rare
skill When a chief or the head of a
family dies, he leaes bis mask to bia
successor, and the latter is bound to
wear it In eery illage there Is aa
artist who repairs masks and occasion
ally makes a few new ones, and it Is
said that no one does a more thriing
business than he
Ethnologists hae been trying to find
out the exact time when these masks
first came Into use, but all they hae
learned as yet is that they hae been
popular in Africa for many centuries

S happening in any part of the county Our reg

 ' writing material and stamps for this purpose
Births, deaths, marriages, accidents, amuse
ments, mining and other Industrial progress,

MUST BE PUBLIC
Section 4035 of the political code,
referring to the board of superisors,
saysPersonal
"All meetings of the board must be
public"
How strangely at ariance is this
command with the practice of going
into "executie" session, which is
getting so common in this county as
to be looked upon as a feature of
eery monthly meeting of the board
At the meeting of the board held
this week, another of these secret
sessions was held The people of
Amador county, whose serants the
superisors are, would like to know
what business affecting their inter
ests requires transaction, or een
discussion, with closed doors And
in face of the aboe mandatory pro
ision, what right has the board, as
such, to hold any meeting without
the hearing of the public, and with
out een the presence of the clerk
or any other official When one of
these "executie" conclaes is called,
not only' the spectators, but the
clerk and the district attorney, and
all other county officials are expect
ed to clear out of the assembly room
at the same time The superisors
want to be left alone with them
seles The idea is not only in con
flict with legal requirements; it is
absurd upon its face Think of it?
The people of Amador county hae
business of such a delicate nature to
transact that they don't want to re
eal the nature of it een to them
seles That is the logical con
clusion to be drawn from these so
called "executie" sessions ' And
we hae no hesitation in saying" that
out a dissenting oice, will reolt
against the idea of being placed in
such a light
NO FREE AVERTISING
In future, the publishers of this paper
will not insert any article, item or
notice, which in any manner will sere
as an adertisement, without charging
therefor in accordance with the ad
ertising rates, (within its classifica
tion), as are established by this paper
— Angels Echo
The Ledger extends the glad band
to the Echo for the decisie stand it
has taken on this proposition It is
the only straightforward and honor
able course for a publisher to follow
If any person has anything that he
wants published in the local paper
that is intended to be of pecuniary
benefit to him, he should be willing
to pay a fair price for the publisher's
serices If he is not willing to pay
for the serice, the publisher should
hae the stamina to refuse to do it
for glory It behooes eery coun
try publisher, from strictly business
considerations, and in defense of the
dignity of his calling, to adopt the
aboe rule But we regret to say
that all newspaper men do not take
the same common sense iew of the
matter And while our Calaeras
county cotemporary is taking firm
ground toward the emancipation of
the profession from a crying eil, a
brother editor in Amador county is,
and has been for years past, flying
the following dishonorable proclama
tion at the head of bis columnsPersonal
The ispatch desires to publish all
announcements of socials, festials, etc,
that are going on All such notices of
entertainments will be published one
insertion free, as a matter of news
What a contrast The Angels
paper is striing to eleate the busi
ness, the Amador paper to degrade
and destroy it
The superior judges of San Fran
cisco hae gien an opinion that is
likely to hae a disquieting effect
upon those who hae been diorced
and married within the last sixty
days This time coers the period
between the passage of the new law
relating to diorces and its going
into effect May lis the date of its
becoming operatie It was intend
ed to do away with the socalled Reno
marriages; that is the practice
which has grown to be so common of
persons, in order to eade the pro
ision of the California law requir
ing a period of one year to elapse
between diorce and remarriage, of
haing the marriage ceremony per
formed in Reno immediately follow
ing the granting of a diorce in Cal
ifornia The present law seeks to
aoid this by proiding that a de
cree of diorce shall not become
absolute until after the lapse of one
year from the granting of such de
cree The sixty days interal how
eer has been interpreted as a sort
of neutral ground The old law was
annuled and the new law was not in
force, so it was assumed that  di
orced parties could remarry',wher
eer and wheneer i they pleased
within the sixty days A rushing
business was done in most of the
counties Now the courts hae
spread consternation in the camp of
the speedy marriages by declaring
that the old law was operatie dur
ing the interal  This means that
those who hae been diorced and
remarried in California are not
legally married And they cannot
now be married according to law
until the lapse of a full year from
the granting of the diorce
On the other hand other eminent
law expounders contend that these
marriages are not contrary to law
And so things are pretty thoroughly
muddled Jndges and lawyers are
at loggerheads on such a ital sub
ject as marriage And it all comes
of the spirit of monkeying with the
laws concerning questions which
should remain fixed and stable,
which seems  to be a con tro'ling fac
tor with tbe lawmaking body
 The board of superisors hae let
a contract to put a new roof on the
court house, the material decided
upon being tin The present roof is
of shingles It is in a fair state of
preseration today, barring one or
two spots It has done serice for
seen or eight years The water
proof character of a wood roof,
properly laid, is conceded; the only
drawback being the danger from
fire — a danger from which a public
building should be safeguardedPersonal as
far as possible i the nature of ! its
roofing material Those who hae
had experience with tin roofs in this
climate — where the temperature
aries during summer months as
much as 80 degrees in 24 hours— are
not enthused on the subject The
contraction and expansion of the
metal has proed a source of con
stant' annoyance from leaks The
strong tendency is to turn to some
other fire proof material, in prefer
ence It is hoped the county will
meet with better success in this line
than has attended the efforts of
priate indiiduals
The question whether tbe new law
proiding a salary for justices and
constables is applicable to present
incumbents, is now before the court
for settlement The issue is clean
cut on the merits of the case James
McCauley, a justice of the peace
elected in lone, brings suit for
salary according to the proisions
of the new law It is iikely, which
eer way the matter is decided, that
the case will be appealed to the su
At any rate it is sincerely to be
hoped that it will reach the highest
tribunal \  » Personal

The garden seed sent out annually
by the department of agriculture is
supposed to be of choice arieties
Some poor lots may creep in occasion

of the quality of the seed John C
Rader, who has a ranch on Stony
creek, brought to our office last Satur
day, a samplo of lettuce grown from
department seed receied through the
Ledger office last year It was of im
mense size, measuring oer a yard in

was large We hae still considerable
seed on hand which can be had for the
asking

TWO PIONEERS PASS AWAY
* THOS B GREENHALUH •
Thos B Greenhalgb, one of the
early pioneers of California, died at his
home in Jackson, Monday, May 4, at
the age of 75 years, 10 months and 13
days For a couple of years the de
ceased has been ery feeble, but has
been able to be about town until the
past three months, during which time
he has been confined to his home
Mr Greenhalgh was born In Bolton,
England, in 1827 When quite a child
he came to Fall Rier, Mass, where he
resided until 1848 In Noember of
148, in company with some two hun
dred men, be chartered a sailing essel
and enduring the many hardships inci
dent to the oyage around Cape Horn,
landed at San Francisco February 27,
1849, and from there journeyed to Jack
son, Amador county, where he has
lied for tbe past fifty years The
esteem in which this "Pioneer Father"
was held was manifested by the large
attendance at the funeral, which took
place from the family residence on
Court street, Wednesday, May 6, at
2 o'clock p m The funeral serices
which were conducted by Re G H
Van Vliet of the M E church, were
fittingly appropriate to the memory of
one who has lied so long and promi
nently in our community
As a last brotherly act of affection,
J Meehan, J ick, C Peters, WV P'
Peek, H Goldner, and G Archer, the
remaining Jackson pioneers, attended
the funeral in a body, escorted by
Excelsior Parlor No 31, N S G W,
and Ursula Parlor No 1, N  G W
At the grae an appropriate funeral
serice was read, and kind remarks
made by J Meehan in behalf of the
Pioneers
As a mark of respect, not only to the
deceased but as well to the sorrowing
relaties, especially W H, Greenhalgh,
who is prominent in the educational
interests of Amador county, the Jack
son public school was closed for the
funeral serices,, and to further express
true sympathy for their coworker and
his brother and sisters in their deep
affliction, a handsome floral piece bear
ing the teachers' card, was noticed
among the many beautiful floral
offerings
It can truly be said that the old
Greenhalgh home is broken up, for
ten years ago the wife and mother of
the home, one of those gentle spirits
whom eeryone loed, departed this
life, and now the father has gone,
leaing to mourn his death, two sons
and two daughters —W H Green
halgh, principal of tbe Sutter Creek
publLs school, J J Greenhalgh of
Tuolumne county, Mrs, B C O'Neill
of Jackson, and Mrs S A Weriy of

sincere sympathy

LOCAL MINING NEWS
Notes From Amador County Mines
Bright Outlook Along the Line
Zeila — This mine is now running
full blast The mill Is running only
thirty of Its forty stamps The
chlorlnation works were started up
last Friday Fewer men are employed
underground than formerly, not merely
on account of the reduced number of
stamps In motion, but also because the
extraction of milling rock is confined at
present to about onethird of the ore
body heretofore worked The thirty
stamps are expected to pound out as
much, If not more, gold than was ob
tained from the forty stamps when a
less rigorous selection of the ore was In
ogue
Kennedy — An accident happened
at this mine early Sunday morning at
the old shaft, which caused a stoppage
of work for one day The shaft carry
ing the chie broke, causing the skip
to drop seeral feet, but doing no
particular harm The shafting was
taken to Knight's foundry for repairs
The men were laid off one shift Eery
thing was  running again' Monday
morning
South Eureka— Under the man
agement of J Truscott, this property
is looking better than it has done for a
longtime A body of good pay 'rock
has been discoered on the leel recent
ly opened, and the 20 stamp mill is to
be started thereon in a few days The
shareholders are in a more jubilant
spirit For ten or twele years the mine
has been worked, costing the stock
holders some hundreds of thousands of
dollars The prospect is now con
sidered faorable for some return on
their inestment
Boston— lt is reported that the
Boston mine, which Is located on the
Calaeras side of the Mokelumne rier,
opposite the Standard Electric Works,
will be started in the near future A
strong company is said to be backing
tbe enterprise Tbe rpek is of low
grade, but there is lots of It There is
a small mill on the property, and this,
according to rumor, is to be augmented
to 100 stamps With this crushing
capacity the mine has a good prospect
of becoming a paying enture
Alma— We are told that the deeds
for this property hae been executed
There was, and still is, some dispute
affecting a portion of the premises in
cluded within the deed When the
ground was sureyed it was found that
the bond called for between four and
fie acres for which the grantor had no
record title There is also some con
tention regarding a strip of land front
ing on the north fprk of Jackson creek,
and which was formerly used as a pub
lic road  Mattley, the grantor,
obligates himself to furnish a title to
all the laud embraced In the deeds It
is reported that an effort will be made
soon to float tbe property, and that
foreign capitalists are expected to fur
nish the money needed to further de
elop the ground According to all
reports, there is a fair prospect of de
eloping a paying mine It is conceded
to be on the main gold bearing lode
The regular gouge characteristic of the
lode, was encountered, and some pay
rock struck It would be in line with
tbe fortune of mining entures, for the
next company that takes hold to de
elop a big diidend paying property

death last Thursday under peculiar cir
cumstances The parents lie on Sut
ter hill, near the Vicini hotel On the
day In question the father had taken
some pills for some ailment It is sup
posed that the child noticing the father
taking the medicine, and with a pro
pensity for imitation strong in the in
fant mind, got the notion to take some
herself Accordingly" she swallowed
some of the pills — whether one or more
we hae not heard The precise nature
of the pellets we do not know The
child was taken iolently sick after
partaking thereof Eerything was
done to reliee the sufferings of the
little one, but to no purpose, as she
died in a short time thereafter The
parents were distracted with grief oer
the sad affair, and the sympathy of the
neighborhood was strongly expressed
for them in their distress The child
was buried Sunday No inquest was
held

School Picnic at Plymouth
Tbe pretty little alley In which the
Slate Creek schoolhouse Is located was
enliened by the presence of seeral
hundred people on Saturday, May 2.
The occasion being a picnic under the
auspices of the Slate Creek, Spring
Valley and Willow Springs schools
The teachers of the respectie districts,
Miss Mamie Wheeler, Miss Laura N
Maybury and Miss Mabel Wheeler,
spared no pains to make the affair a
success, and to say they succeeded is
putting it mild Nature has been kind
to many portions of Amador county ,*
and particularly so to the country ad
jacent to scenes of Saturday's festii
ties; thus making it an ideal place to
hold a picnic The grounds are gener
ously supplied with oak trees, large
and small, the grass fresh and green,
and with the groups of prettily dressed
women and children scattered pro
miscuously about in the full enjoyment
of health and "happiness, could any
thing more beautiful be Imagined?
The day's entertainment began at
10 a m with appropriate exercises,
which were held in front of the school
house, the same being  handsomely
decorated with American flags, also
ferns and flowers gathered from the
woods The following program was
rendered to an appreciatie audience,
and lasted until high noonPersonal I

Word was then passed, "one hour
for lunch," and of all the good things
to eat none were missing at this time
If you eer attended a picnic near Ply
mouth town you could realize what
it was; otherwise it is useless to make
you comprehendPersonal It would be an im
possibility
The feature of the afternoon Personal was a
baseball game between the Plymouth
and a "pickup" nine It was eident
from the start that the ''pickups"
were not In It Their pitcher couldn't
find "home base," and tally after tally
was made by the other side without as
much as striking at the ballPersonal In the
fourth Inning, howeer, Loe' of Oleta
and Waddell of lone were put In as
catcher and pitcher for the "green
horns" Then things were different,
but It was too late to sae the day and
Plymouth won by a score of 22 to 12
The ball game was witnessed by an
enthusiastic crowd of "spoolers," and
the Plymouth girls can "take the cake"
—how they can 'yellPersonal A series' of races
and other games bad been arranged
for the afternoon, but were not entered
into owing to the time occupied by the
ball game Eeryone was pleased with
the day's outing, and much credit is
due to the young ladles who planned
the pleasures of the day

Petition for Opening of a Lane
The following petition has been filed
with the board of superisors, and will
be acted upon at next meetingPersonal
Whereas a certain public street or
lane In the townsite of Jackson proper
ly laid down and marked upon the of
ficial map of said townsite and more
particularly described as followsPersonal Be
ginning on the west side of tbe street
or highway known as Sutter road and
running thence southwesterly between
the lots numbered 24 and 31 and thence
southerly between the lots numbered
30 on the west and lots 24, 22, 21, 32,
and 33, on the east in block numbered
10 of said townsite, as shown on the
plat annexed to petition,  Is at certain
points entirely closed, making it im
 possible for the public to trael said
street or lane, either with ehicles or
on foot   
Now therefore, we the undersigned
residents of Jackson, respectfully ask
your honorable board to open or cause
street or lane to be opened to Its full
width and length, at as early a date as
practicable Signed by 16 residents
and property holders
The street in question runs from a
point on Main street near Lemin 's sa
loon, crossing the north fork of Jackson
creek, and thence on the west bank of
the creek, finally connecting with
Vogan street, running by the west side
of the National hotel The northern
portion of this alleged public road has
been fenced and closed for many years
It is expected that the petition for the
remoal of the obstructions  will
awaken considerable opposition, and
may possibly lead to a contest In the
courts

Somnambulism? What is it? id you
eer walk in your sleep? If so, you
know Just about as much about this
strange use of the faculties and senses
of the mind and the body as does the
aerago physician Somnambulism has
been a mystery and a matter of discus
sion to the medical profession since the
days of the ancients They knew as
well as we all now know that there Is
such a thing as somnambulism or walk
ing in the sleep They attempted to ex
plain It just as modern medical science
has been endeaoring to explain It eer
since But as It was then so It Is now
There are so many explanations that
een the physician Is puzzled to decide
which to accept

IN THE STOKEHOL
P*edlns tliw Many Rarnoua Pjr
uitrea In an Ocean Liner
The work of eternally pushing the
olil ship on past the meridians— the
nice iiulnst time and the sun and the
Interest on the money— begins in the
gloomy stokehold You hae heard
that the stokehold is hot, and when
you hae clambered into it oer dis
orderly piles of still smoking ashes,
steadying yourself by taking incau
tious hold of burning hand rails, and
Stand for the first time face to face
with the furnaces you feel assured of
the fact
But, besides being hot, it is the moft
actie, interesting part Of the ship It
is her whole life You must spend
years studying it before you can stand
there in command of your watch with
your hand on the feed check ales,
your eyes on eerything in general, and
keep the steam up where it belongs In
spite of the raenous engines sucking
it away from you i years before yon
can tell, in one swift glance, wimher
a fireman is burning the greatest possi
ble amount of coal per hour in his fires
with the least amount of waste
The problem is thisPersonal Under a certain
large quantity of water, which is con
tinually changing, build thirty fires,
and by means of them, notwithstand
ing they must all be continually replen
ished with fresh coal and freed from
ashes, keep it at a perfectly een tern*
peraturo (within a ery few degrees),
day and night for an indefinite period
The game is the more interesting be
cause a ship can neer afford to spare
more than just barely enough space
for her propelling machinery; conse
quently eerything— engines, boilers,
furnaces— must be worked to the ery
limit of its capacity
The game goes as regularly by turns
and in cycles as progressie whist
Starting with a few fires first In order,
the doors are opened to admit a few
shoelfuls of coal thrown quickly Into
the front of the furnaces, then closed
again as soon as possible lest too much
cold air should enter As soon as they
are closed the fires next in order are
sered the same way and then a third
group Next the "green" coal In the
first fires is raked back through the
furnaces to complete its combustion
After another short interal It is nec
essary to "slice" them— that is, probe
them with long pointed bars to lift the
clinkers from the grates and make air
passages Finally it is time to stoke
again— Benjamin Brooks In Scribner's
How Cnlnese Hatcb Fish
The Chinese hae a method of hatch
ing the spawn of fish and thus protect
ing It from those accidents which gen
erally destroy a large portion of It The
fishermen collect with care from the
margin and surface of water all those
gelatinous masses which contain the
spawn of fish, and after they hae
found a sufficient quantity they fill
with it the shell of a fresh hen's egg,
which they hae preiously emptied,
stop up the bole and put it under a sit
ting fowl At the expiration of a cer
tain number of days they break the
shell in water warmed by the sun The
young fry are presently batched and
are kept In pure, fresh water till they
an> large enough to be thrown Into tho
pom] with the old fish The sale of
spawn for this purpose forms an im
portant branch of trade In China
A nd Country For Ilats
Hats hae a hard time in China The
climate, alternating from Intense dry
uoss to a horrible humidity, twists and
distorts silk, beaer, cloth and felt In
no time Mold and fungus are uni
ersal and* conert sweatband and
brim into green elet in a single
night Eery hat must be put out In
the sunlight three times a week or It Is
ruined Besides these foes are ants
which go eerywhere and cockroaches
which fly like birds The ant enjoys a
good hat for a playground and a sleep
ing establishment; the cockroach de
sires merely to eat eery particle of
leather, paper and pasteboard It con
tains The only way to keep the pests
off is to sprinkle the interior occasion
ally with carbolic add, creosote of
crude cressol

In almost eery dally paper are to be
Been seeral announcements that some
body has died suddenly These sudden
deaths are more liable to be men than
women Mr Soandso fell dead on the
Btreet or In his office while writing let
ters or preparing a sermon or doing
something or other "Pound ead In
His Boom" is becoming a ery com
mon headline These deaths are hard
ly eer accounted for Generally some
thing is said about the heart — some
ague insinuation that the heart was
not acting in a proper manner — but, as
a rule, no explanation which Is really
rational is furnished
It is a well known fact that the heart
Is a muscle If the muscles of the body
are allowed to become flabby, the heart
also becomes flabby A flabby heart
may be trusted to pump the blood
through the system ordinarily, but a
sudden fright or 'emergency, A sudden
expenditure of energy, as in running
up steps or any other unusual exercise,
Is liable to oerpower the heart It
suddenly stops, and the man falls dead
 Tobacco tends to produce a flabby
heart; whisky tends to produce en
largement of the heart; lazy, Indolent
habits weaken the heart and thin the
entricles That man who Indites edi
torials, dictates letters, but takes no
muscular exercise, is in danger of fall
ing dead The life insurance man bet
ter steer clear of him It is of astly
more importance to know what his hab
its are with reference to physical exer
cise than to know whether his grand
mother died of heart  disease or his
grandfather had rheumatism The doc
tor might a great deal better Interiew
his wife and discoer how the man be
haes himself than to examine the
blood for microbes or the urine for
urate crystals
If a man must be strenuous, let him
be strenuous all round He should take
a little strenuous physical exercise e

work It Is een dangerous to neglect
to take dally physical exercise Fatty

differentiated Infinitie forms; but on
the other hand, there Is no real dis
tinction between nouns, adjecties, ad

Settling; a Hotel Bill la Portugal
In Portugal when the traeler asks
for his Mil the landlord pleasantly rubs
his bauds together and answers,
"Whateer your excellency pleases to
gie"
This will not do, for the traeler Is
sure to offer too little or too much and
to be thought either a spendthrift or a
niggard, so he has to make a speech,
thank the landlord for his confidence
and beg for a detailed statement
Then the landlord, politely deprecat
ing anything of the kind, is slowly per
suaded to check off the arious items
upon the fingers of his hand, with a
long argument before each successie
finger Is done with and doubled down

Ancient Needlework
Some of the oldest needlework extant
was found in Egyptian dnd Egypto
Roman tombs— a rough sort of flaxen
cloth, like the bath toweling of our
own day It has loops of wool worked
with some kind of needle, raised on
one side of the stuff only, and a kind
of tapestry partly woen and partly
outlined In needlework The mummies
which an insatiable modern curiosity
has disturbed are wrapped In linen, as
less liable than woolen doth to the
raages of moth, and the art of wea
ing the flax that grew so plentifully on
the banks of the Nile was ' probably
learned by the Israelites during their
sojourn in Egypt
Ezeklel speaks of "fine linen with
bro'dered work from Egypt" Linen
seems the natural ground and founda

cleaned and will not fray or wear out,
as do more costly silks and satins—
