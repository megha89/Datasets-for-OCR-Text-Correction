French Housekeepinff
 French cook turns any and eery
thing to adantage, and many a culi
nary chef d'eeure Is the result of care
and skill rather than rare or costly in
gredients With Just a pinch of sa
ory herbs and a clear fire a cook will
turn shreds of cold meat into dellcious
Iy appetizing morsels, gastronomic dis
crimination on the part of her patrons
keeping up the standard of excellence
If I were asked to point out the lead
ing characteristic of the French mind
I should unhesitatingly say that it is
the critical faculty, and to this faculty
we owe not only the unrialed French
cuisine, but pleasures of the table gen
erally Here is one Instance in pointPersonal
One quite ripe melon to the uninitiated
tastes ery much like another, but a
French, country gentleman knows bet
ter Wheneer a melon of superlatie
flaorPersonal is sered he orders the seeds
to be set aside for planting Thus the
superlatie kind is propagated The
critical faculty is eer alert in France,

pleteness—Cornhill Magazine 
Saed by Quick Wit
Isabel F Hapgood, the translator of
many of Tolstoi's books, once isited
the great Russian, and during her is
it he told her a story of one of his an
cestors This ancestor, an army offi
cer, was an excellent mimic One day
he was impersonating the Emperor
Paul to a group of his friends when
Paul himself entered and for some
moments looked on, ' unperceied, at
the antics of the young man Tolstoi
finally turned and, beholding the em
peror, bowed his head and was silent
"Go on, sir," said Paul "Continue
the performance"
The young man hesitated a moment,
and then,' folding his arms and imitat
ing eery gesture and intonation of his
soereign, he saidPersonal  Personal *,
"Tolstoi, you desere to be degraded,
but I remember the thoughtlessness of
youth, and you are pardoned"

Foe's Loe of Richmond
Poe loed Richmond as he loed no
other place on earth His happy child
hood was spent there — the only period
of his troubled life which was free
from want Here he found bis foster
father, John llan, who was proud of
the orphan boy, and the only mother
he eer knew, who was sweet and gen
tle with him to the end Here were
the friends and playmates of hia boy
hood, and here lied the gentle wo
man who was the Helen of the most
beautiful of his early poems Here,
after a first ceremony in Baltimore, he
was married by a second to the loely
and youthful Virginia Clemm, and
here they spent the happiest year of
their married life Here, as editor of
the Southern ' Literary Messenger, he

Where the Camel Is Fonnd
The camel is found In rabia, Per
sia, sia Minor, fghanistan, Balu
chistan, Mongolia, western China and
northern India as well as in Syria,
Turkey, north frica and parts of
Spain The camel Is known by the
same root word in nearly all these
lands Not a page scarcely of an ra
bic lexicon but has reference to the
camel The language itself, according
to Hammer Purgstall, knows him by
6,7 names The only reason why
Scripture is comparatiely silent Is be
cause the topography of the Holy
Land Is such that in most parts the
use of the camel is an impossibility
Letters of Introduction
Try not to ask for letters of intro
duction to your friends' friends It
often causes both embarrassment and
Inconenience If the letter of intro
duction Is offered accept It and present
it dutifully It will not be difficult to
ascertain whether or not the person to
whom it is addressed finds the intro
duction a pleasure or a bore It is folly
to pursue an acquaintance thus gained
unless each finds the other congenial—
Exchange
ltitude and Voice
Generally speaking, races liing at
high altitudes hae weaker and more
highly pitched oices than those liing
In regions where the supply of oxygen
Is more plentiful Thus among the
Indians liing on the plateau between
the ranges of the ndes, at an elea
tion of from 10,000 to 1,000 feet the
men hae oices like women, and wo
men like children, and their singing Is
a shrill monotone
Plenty of Opportunities

libraries, of newspapers and period

Copyright, 1903, by T C McClure
The ferry at cton, a small summer
resort lying next a most pleasurable
stretch of lake, was operated solely
by its owner, OkT be, as he was •
called The serice  had ' come to be
of such an unstable character that the
illagers had lost all confidence in it
as a means of transportation
Howeer, Marian rdsley, was not
an inhabitant of the illage, and so
she stepped confidently aboard the
boat assisted by Old be s he
bustled about, he was softly chuckling
and repeating to himself, "Two, two"
The rear third' of be's stern
wheeler was pilot house and engine
room, the central portion was cabin,
and in front was what may be termed
a deck On this deck was seated, the
other of be's "two" passengers,
lonzo llen, of New York
llen didn't know, as a matter of
fact where he was going, nor did he
care He had seen the old man put
tering about the boat and, on learn
ing that a start would soon be made
for somewhere, he had listlessly taken
a seat for the trip
With a toot of the squeaky whistle
the boat got under way Marian, wish
ing to stand in the prow, walked
through the cabin But at sight of
her fellow passenger she turned pink
with embarrassment and quickly re
treated and sat down on the long,
carpet coered seat that was built
through the middle of the cabin
Under the guidance of the Jubilant
old man, the boat adanced in a ery
satisfactory manner— at least to him—
until about half way across the lake
Here the paddle wheel refused to con
tinue reoling, and, after some
minutes of drifting, the boat was still
t this point a thunder shower,
which bad for a time back been stead
ily approaching, broke oer the lake
llen, not desiring a drenching, rose
to his feet and went into the cabin
In the darkening interior he saw no
one, and sat down on the middle of
the seat with a sigh, putting his elbows
on his knees and face in hands
Marian was sitting but an arm's
length from him fter an awkward
pause speut in cogitation, she coughed
lightly llen started to his feet di
rectly, and, with a bow saidPersonal
"I do beg your pardon, madam; 1— "
nd then a flash lighted the cabin for
an Instant and he plainly saw his com
panion's face
"I thought I was alone," he added
simply, and awkwardly backing to the
farther end of the seat he sat down
There was some reason for these
seemingly strange actions It was but
the preious eening that they had
quarreled, and at the end he had
fiercely taken back the ring she prof
fered, and they had parted foreer
t length, "Why are we stopping
here?" asked Marian of the boatman,
who sat at his post In perfect tran
quillity
"Jest a screw loose, miss," the old
man replied "I figger I know where
'tis now, and we'll be goln' again in
a Jiffy"
nd with that Old be, tools in
hand, climbed around to the all im
portant paddle wheel fter an ex
asperating wait of perhaps twenty
minutes, Marian peered out from the
door, and, seeing no one, called, "Mr
Ferryman!" She was now heartily
wishing she had stayed at the house
"I'm awful sorry, miss'," answered
the old man rather dolefully, "but
I'm afraid it'll take a teenty bit longer
You see, it's worsen I thought"
"o you hae to stop like this
often?" asked Marian
"Well, sometimes But now last
week she didn't break down, Monday
nor Wednesday, all the hull way oer!"
nd, saying this, Old be rose to his
full height grinning wlthpride
"Well, I suppose it can't be helped,
then," submitted Marian, but she ap
peared so ery much annoyed that
be at once leaned down and con
tinued his work with a great show of
bustle • 
The rain was not yet oer, and llen
was busily engaged staring ery hard
at nothing whateer Marian looked
at her watch It was past lunch time,
and, as she had felt too miserable to
eat much breakfast she commenced to
feel hungry  sudden thought bright
ened her countenance— she had with
her a box of candles which she had
purchased for her sister's children
She could get them another box She
looked at her watch again Only a
few minutes more had passed, but her
hunger had now become unbearable
She loosed the string from the box,
opened fee paper, remoed the coer
and ate a chocolate
fter she had eaten seeral of the
candies she glanced oer at llen
•Fastened to the wall of the cabin op
posite him was an old landscape in a
dingy frame, and he was gazing at
this with the concentration of a stole 
" landscape 1" mentally exclaimed
Marian, as she recalled his dislike of
landscapes "How he must bate me,"
she continued, eating another candy,
"when he'd rather look at that than at
mot I wonder— what had I ought to
Go? If be and I were utter strangers,
tost on a desert Isle, and he had a
dozen kernels of corn I should think
pirn a cad If be didn't offer me half
I think I ought to offer him some of
jMeee candles, een if we're not on
Speaking terms"

aheadt Marian pushed the candy boj
•long the seat  llen paid no attention
"Won't you hae a chocolate T Ma
rian asked at length, hesitatingly
llen made no answer
 "Will you"— and Marian stamped hei
little foot—'! say, wijl you hae a choc
olate?" she continued Impatiently
"No, I thank yon," he replied, and re
sumed his contemplation of the land
scape
j  long pause ensued The  box re
mained half way, between them
I "I  think you're ery—ungentleman
ty," entured Marian
 "Last night you were of the same
opinion," retorted llen
r "Yon are more so now" '  '
J "How?"
I "Well, yon— you know that I'm too
polite to eat these chocolates and let
you go hungry— and , I'm simply star
ed"
;  With an air of exaggerated polite
ness llen reached oer, took a candj
and ate it bis eyes fixed the while up,
on the landscape Marian then ate one,
waited In silence for ten minutes and
again offered the box to llen, who
helped himself ery graely and hand
ed It back This operation was re
peated until soon only one candy w,ae
left The remaining one was heart
shaped
llen handed the box to Marian She
took the box, but directly offered 11
back to him
 "No, thank yon," said llen on look
Ing In the box
"But I am offering it to yon," Insist
ed Marian
"It's yours," replied llen nd h<
shot a quick glance at Marian, who
had been gradually moing from her
end of the seat and was now past the
middle She slightly raised from hei
seat and, leaning toward him, saidPersonal
"Lon— pardon me— Mr llen, please
take It I want you to hae It"
"Is it— do you mean— you are offer
ing me a heart?" he asked
She might hae answered, but the
boat suddenly started j with a  jerk,
throwing her full Into his arms nd
there she was when the boatman ap
peared In the doorway
"I'm sorry for delayin' ye," said Old
be, "but I'm thlnkln* things be tin
kered Into shape ag'ln now" nd thai
was true enough
"We"— and Marian looked at llen
"we're not blaming you, Mr Ferry
man"
"No, and we'll take the trip back
with you," added llen
"Thank 'c; thank 'c, sir," replied Old
be nd as he went back to his work
there was a merry twinkle in his eye,
and he chuckled to himselfPersonal
"They're not blamln' me, but 1 could
'a' started the dura old craft Jest hall
an hour ago!"
Cooler Than Cool
Sydney Smith's name for Moncktos

the other guests
Milnes' manner to the great wit and
diine was lacking In the respect due
to age and position He caimly ad
dressed him as "Smith," which eery
time made those" who felt what was

of an nirPersonal
"I'm poinjr on to the a rclibisbop's re

The Upright Jndge
 New York magistrate and his
friend were returning from a banquet
arm in arm and were giing way to
mirth and song when they found
themseles confronted by the police
The magistrate made his escape, but
on the following day as be sat on the
bench, "grae, dignified and alert,' as
usual," he saw his dear and alued
friend charged with being drunk and
disorderly He listened to the charge
unmoed beyond a pained expression
on his face and, after calling upon the
prisoner to explain his conduct, ad
dressed him in his most seerely judi
cial manner and In scathing tones
Neer had he heard a more disgraceful
case, and It was so much tho more dis
graceful from the fact that the pris
oner eidently was respectably con
nected and moed In what was called
(here be became ery sarcastic) good
society He felt it was a matter where
leniency would be surely out of place,
and the fine must be the maximum
which the law allowed

n Odd Jewish Ceremony
In the Jewish Encyclopaedia is an ac
count of the queer ceremony of the
taking off a brotherinlaw's shoe by
the widow of a brother who has died
childless, through which ceremony he
Is released from the obligation of mar
rying her The ceremony is described
as followsPersonal
The yabam (brotherinlaw) must
hae his right foot on which the shoe
is placed,  washed ery j scrupulously,
tnd after he has  strapped it on he
must walk four cubits in the presence
of the Judges Then the chief of the
Judges reads the following passage,
which the yabamah (woman) j repeats
word for wordPersonal "My brotherinlaw re
fuses to raise unto his brother a name
In Israel; he will not marry me" Then
the yabam Is required to repeat the
sentence, "I do not wish to take her"
He then presses his right foot against
the floor while she looses the straps
with her right hand, takes off the shoe
and throws it some distance away
Then she places herself in front of tho
yabam, spits on the floor in front of
him and repeats these words after the
presiding JudgePersonal "So shall it be done
unto that man who will not build up
his brother's house, and his name shall
be called in Israel 'the house of him
that hath his shoe loosed' "
Poison In Walls
"s much as 6 per cent of organic
matter has been found in plaster taken
from the walls of a hospital ward in
Paris" Statistics tell us that it is not
uncommon to find air in public assem
bly rooms and een in dwellings con
taining from ten to fifteen times the
amount of carbonic acid found in pure
air Of this gas Tomllnson saysPersonal, "lt
acts as a poison If we attempt to
Inhale It by putting the face oer the
edge of a beer at the nostrils and

Tying; a Horse to a Hole
It has been discoered that the des
ert Indians, who hae neer been ac
credited with superabundant wits, hae
for many years employed a method of
tying their horses to holes in the
ground that Is cleer, unique and ef
fectie The operation of tying a horse
to a hole seems an Impracticable and
impossible one, for there is something
decidedly intangible and unsubstantial
about the hole The operation is per
formed in this wayPersonal Kneeling on the
hot sands, the Indians dig with their
hands until they hae made a hole
about two feet deep They then tie an
immense knot in the end of the halter
rope, lower it into the bottom of the
bole, fill the hole with sand and then
jump and stamp upon it until the earth
oer the knot is about as hard as sand

WHY COLORS FE
The ction of Light and ir Is What
Causes the Change
The fastness of color depends on the
stability of the coloring matter as well
as on that of th combination between
the material and the color Nearly all
organic colors are bleached by the con
tinued action of light and ah*' Light
alone can cause changes and faors
the formation of small quantities oi
ozone and hydrogen peroxide, especial
ly In the presence of water, which Is
always to be found in all ordinary ma
terials ''
These two substances are powerful
oxidizing agents, readily giing up a
portion of the oxygen contained In
them, and this combines with or oxi
dizes the coloring matter, forming a
body closely allied to it but which la
less intensely colored, and in some
cases, if the action is carried fat
enough, the color is entirely destroyed
The chemical effects of the different
colored rays ary greatly Red, yel
low and green are practically Inert as *
bleaching agents, while blue, iolet and
, ultra iolet rays hae a most powerful
chemical action This fact explains why
materials which are usually worn at
night and hence are exposed only to gas
or candle light do not fade rapidly, these
llluminants not haing a  preponder
ance of the blue and iolet rays, while,
sunlight which contains a large propor
tion of these ' chemically actie rays,
quickly affects colored fabrics

I Keep your blood clean as you keep your
body clean Yon don't wait ' until your
body is foul before you cleanse it 
It is a matter of surprise that many peo
ple who are so careful to hae clean bodies
make no effort to keep the blood clean
Eeryone knows that uncleanness breed*
disease; that those who do not keep their
bodies in a wholesome condition and wbo
dwell in filthy surroundings are the first to
fall when some epidemic of disease sweeps
the country But foul blood is more dan
gerous to the indiidual than a foul body
n unclean body is rather a passie than
an actie hindrance to health But unclean
blood is an actie threat against the ery
life — it makes the body a prepared breed
ing place for disease
 It is part of Nature's plan for human
safety that in many cases where the blood
is impure or corrupt she sets a sign on the
body in proof of the corrupt current that is
flowing through the eins Scrofula with
its disfiguring sores and scars, eczema with
its irritation, saltrheum, tetter, erysipelas,
boils, pimples and other eruptions are only
the outward signs of the impurity of the
blood But often in the earlier or simpler
stages of the blood's impurity there are no
outward signs of this condition; only dull,
languid, sluggish feelings, which are com
monly attributed solely to the sluggishness
of the lier
Of all preparations for purifying the
blood r Pierces Golden Medical isco
ery easily takes the first place It elimin
ates from the blood the elements which 
clog and corrupt it, and which breed and
feed disease It acts directly on the blood
making glands, increasing their actiity,
and so increasing the supply of rich, pure
blood which is the life of the body

ROOSEVELT N FIRBNKS
The republican conention unani
mously nominated Theodore Roose

a nomination that the people of the
United States, irrespectie of party,
had trade months before Neer in
the history of this country has a
nomination come to a presidential
candidate with as little opposition
as did this one nd neer before
was a man who succeeded to the
presidency through the death of the
president nominated for the high
position Rooseelt is a man of the
people, and has shown himself for
the people The people hae now
reciprocated, and by words and
deed hae shown themseles to be
for Rooseelt That he will be re
elected no one seriously doubts The
horde of office seekers in the demo
cratic party will wage a war of mis
representation in order to secure
official positions, but the rank and
file of the party are satisfied with
the present condition of affairs aud
propose to let well enough alone
•With Rooseelt and Jonn Hay at the
helm the foreign powers will con
tinue to tip their hats to us as we
pass by Fairbanks for the ice
presidency is a brilliant young sen
ator from Indiana He is a man
who has long been recognized as a
presidential possibility The people

of Indiana if he is not the next pre

this time to comment upon the merits
and demerits of the case We hear
that it has reached such proportions
that the hotel people are afraid to ride

their customers; that the town phy

are opposed to the boycott in any form
It is unmerican, and the day will

Teacher's Balariei
The Stockton City Board of Educa
tion has placed itself squarely on record
concerning the compensation of teach
ers in the public schools Incidentally
the members of the board, submitting
a report, hae hit upon so many topics
of general concern that their reasoning
and presentation of facts hae more
than the ordinary interest The mini
mum salary of Stockton's grade teach
ers is raised from $500 to $600 per an
num, while the maxiutn grade salary
Is raised from $850 to $900 The sal
aries of the principals of the smaller
schools are increased from $900 to $1000
In the High school certain salaries are
adanced
mong the conclusions reached by
the board some are worth attention
throughout the State It is set up as
an axiom that among the requisites of
teachers are tact In management, an
een and kindly disposition and the
health, strength and ability and in
clination for constant improement
dded to these specifications the board
holds it to be essential that teachers
shall be possessed of a moral character
aboe reproach aud that they shall
hae a social training as shown in per
sonal manners, habits and dress that
will present a good example to the
children
The action of the board in raising
salaries is based upon seeral consid
erations Stated concisely, these are
that the growing compensation of the
Stockton teachers has not kept pace
with the higher standards of work de
manded in the schools; that the more
extended training now required takes
from two to six years more time than
was formerly necessary to properly
equip the teacher; that during the pe
riod when the cost of liing has in
creased there has been marked adance
in the salaries in all lines of professional
work with the exception of those for
teaching; that the time and expense
Inoled In becoming a competent
teacher equal such outlays in fitting
for any other profession; that teachers
hae a right to a support that bears a
just relation to the kind of work they
are doing and to the ability ueeded to
do It well
HOW IT WORKS
( From the BakersQeld Californian )
Stockton boasts that it pays the best
teacher's salaries in the State, and the
Mail adds that that city has a teaching
force second to none That necessarily
follows The best teachers are natur
iilly looking for the place that pays the
best salaries— Call
gricultural Education
The moement to secure an agri
cultural education through the public
schools of the country is steadily in
creasing and from time to time mani
fests Itself through unusual channels
t the recent conention of the Trael
ers' Protectie ssociation at Spring
field, Illinois, addresses were made on
this subject and the association oted
to present the matter before the
National Educational ssociation at its
coming annual conention at St Louis
The Traelers' ssociation passed a
comprehensie resolution setting forth
that the stability of our social and
business conditions and the preention
of recurring periods of trade depression
require that the balance of our popula
tion should be maintained on the land
as independent home owners and pro
ducers from the soil, and that ways
should be found and carried out for
placing upon the land all unemployed
labor and transforming eery "outof
work" Into the owner of a home on the
land from which he can at all times
get a comfortable liing with his own
labor It was set forth that the entire
merican educational system should be
so remodeled as to induce eery child
to be a loer of nature and of the coun
try, and to train him toward the land
as a source of lielihood rather than
away from it; that children should be
taught to farm as they are now taught
In France and enmark In the public
schools, and that farm training schools
should be established by county,
municipal, state and national goern
ments
The resolution further called atten
tion to the great remaining public
domain in the west as by far the most
aluable asset of this nation wfhich will
furnish an outlet for our surplus labor
during this and coming generations,
urging that it be resered for real
homebuilders who will farm it in small
tracts
The association appointed a perman
ent committee on education, irrigation,
forestry and land, with a member from
each state and territory to carry out
the idea of this resolution
No More Saloons to be Started in Lodi
Lods to hae no more saloons n
application was made some time ago
by Louis Wetmore to conduct a saloon
there, and the hearing was postponed
from time to time  couple of weeks
ago Re G H eKay, of the Congre
gational church, appeared before the
superisors with a numerouslysigned
petition, but enough names were not
on it, and the board gae the reenend
gentleman two weeks in which to se
cure the requisite number
In the meantime the man who wanted
the saloon got busy and interiewed a
number of those who had signed the
petitio, • and succeeded in haing
eleen persons withdraw their names,
stating that they had signed It under
a misapprehension The district at
torney, howeer, held that these sign
ers had no license to withdraw their
names, and the superisors accordingly
denied the application
In Sacramento county the board of
superisors allowed a similar moe in
the Conley case, allowing signers to
withdraw their names, and now the
people of San Joaquln are wondering
if the same lawß are not applicable to
all parts of the state — Sacramento Bee

conention will meet in the city of St

the temporary chairman, and will take
great pleasure, and perhaps a long
time, to tell the unterriGed what it
will be Impossible for them to do In the
coming campaign The speaker will
receie thunderous applause whether
he is heard or not, and the speech will
be heralded In democratic circles as one
of the most brilliant eer deliered in
a national conention Scores of candi
dates will be present willing to lead  a
forlorn hope, simply to satisfy their
own personal anity Parker, Hearst,
Bryan and Cleeland hae been scoring
for some time, but neither seems to be
1n fit condition to go against Rooseelt
Many dark borses are being groomed

Miles or Geo B McClellan, the son of
his father, may be selected Scott and
Hancock ended their brilliant military
careers by making unsuccessful stands
for the presidency, and it might be well
to gie Miles an opportunity to do the
same John Sharp Williams bas been
spoken of for the icepresidency, but
he has shown himself to be "Shafp
John Williams" and respectfully de
clined  If no eastern man can be se
cured to accept the latter position the
conention can confer the honor upon
almost any one of the California dele
gates or send it by proxy to Franklin
K Lane, who will accept it with thanks
and go down to defeat as gracefully in
Noember as he has in his last two
political entures The platform will
consist of a large mass of generalities
 clause will be inserted to catch the
labor ote; the negroes will be held in
loing embrace until after elction; the
prohibitionists will be told that cold
water is the strongest beerage that an
honest democrat can swallow; corpora

trampled under foot in one clause, and
shown to be the foundation stones of
our goernment In the next Siler
will be declared to be the money of the

that any progressie nation can adopt
and retain its credit with the great
powers of the world The tariff plank
will be for high and low, protection and

Oiled Koadi
 MuCall has about completed the
first part of his contract for oiling the
road between Jackson and lone The
first coat makes quite an impression
since it has become thoroughly mixed
with the dust From MarteU's into
town, where the road has been coered
with a good coating of rock, the oil
seems to hae had tho effect of cement
ing the rock together and making a
decided improement Where the
dust was heay for li^ht driing we
prefer the oil to the dust, hut some of
the driers of the freight, teams con
tend that tho oil has a tendency to
make their loads pull heaier There
are good arguments for and against the
oiling of tbe roads, but Superisors
Moore aud Newman decided to oil and
hired Mr McCall to do the work under
their special superision Just when
the second coat will be applied we were
unable to learn Let those who trael
oer the roads judge with impartiality
of the effects of oiling, and if in faor
of the judgment of tbe superisors gie
them credit If unfaorable place the
blame where it bolougs Oiler

 TRIP TO THE
WORL'S FIR
Notes by the Way
St Louis, June 21
Salt Lake church authorities take
pride in showing isitors around Tem
ple block, in which all the principal
buildings of the church are located
Seeral persons are employed to con
duct strangers through the "different
buildings, and explain the points of in
terest No charge is made, at least to
the isitors, for this serice Natur
ally almost eery tourist makes for
church block He cannot help noticing
it, as it takes up an entire block, and
the blocks of Salt Lake are roomy to
conform with the streets First we
passed through the eseret Museum,
where curios and relics of early days of
Mormonism are kept, and where sou
enirs may be purchased Next comes
the assembly hall, used for both re
ligious and secular meetings It is
much smaller than the Tabernacle, al
though its seating capacity is from
1500 to 2000 The Tabernacle, although
constructed in the pioneer days, is still
a wonderful structure — one of the archi
tectural curios of the world It is 250
feet long by 150 wide, and eliptical in
shape, and 70 feet from floor to the
highest point of the ceiling The roof
is the most striking feature It is an
oal arch, without supporting columns
of any kind, and is still claimed to be
the largest selfsupporting roof, con
structed entirely of wood, in the world
The ceiling is of plaster, and so well
did the artisans do their work that
while 0 years hae passed not a crack
is noticeable Like all the buildings in
Temple square the tabernacle is built
exclusiely of Utah material, the wood
for its dome roof being all handsawed
Eerybody has heard of the Tabernacle
organ It coers as much space as a
goodsized house, and when completed
was the largest in merica, if not in
the world This also is constructed
wholly of wood, and the product of
Mormon artisans  young lady, who
is training herself for the position of
organist, was engaged in practicing at
the time of our isit, so we had the
pleasure of listening to its melodious
oice We say oice, because at inter
als we were unable to detect the
strains that were sent forth as other
than the product of that most potent
of all musical instruments— the human
oice
The guide claimed that the acoustic
properties of the tabernacle are perfect
Goernment experts hae been sent to
find out if possible wherein the secret
lies; they were just as much at sea
when they got through as when they
commenced their task The secret is
past finding out Church zealots are
inclined to regard it as a special inter
position of diine proidence in their
behalf That it has remarkable hear
ing properties is beyond question
While we were there' a man stationed
200 feet away faintly whispered a few
words, and thereafter dropped a pin on
a desk We heard the whisper; some
present said they heard the pin as it
struck the desk, but this was too faint
to reach the writer's hearing
The temple is the "holy of holies"
in Mormon estimation No gentle feet
are permitted to tread its threshold 
Indeed, comparatiely few church
members are allowed to enter its sacred
portals We had to be content with
the guide's brief descriptie statement
and a iew of its massie exterior It
was commenced in 1853 and dedicated
just 0 years thereafter It is built en
tirely of Utah granite, and has six
towers The central tower is 222J feet
high, surmounted by a statue of a gos
pol herald in the act of blowing a trum
pet—symbolical of the introduction of
the latter day dispensation by the Mor
mons This figure is made of copper,
and a mammoth incandescent lamp
sparkles from its summit at night The
guide stated that the precious histori
cal records of the church were housed
in the Temple, and the peculiar rites
of the priesthood, of baptism and mar
riage are solemnized therein
By the street car route we took in as
much of Salt Lake city as it was pos
sible to see during our brief stay Sat
urday morning we returned to Ogden,
and there boarded the U P train for
ener, arriing in that city Sunday
at 11 o'clock a m The trip from
Cheyenne to ener was a surprise, as
it oerturned all preconceied ideas
that Colorado was essentially and al
most exclusiely a mineral producing
state Our train stopped, three hours
in ener, and we happened to get out
side the depot in time to catch a street
car placarded "Seeing ener," which
we boarded for the sake of whiling
away the leisure hours It was a most
pleasurable and instructie trip, oc
cupying two hours, and together with
the explanation gien by a guide
through a speaking trumpet gae a
better idea of this giant city of the west
than could be gained by a week of tour
ing by the ordinary street car ' 'See
ing ener" is an enterprise inaugurat
ed by a corporation Its stockholders
are residents not of Colorado merely
but of many other states Its field of
operations is not ener alone, but a
number of other cities, including Salt
Lake It is extending the list of prom
inent cities as fast as possible San
Francisco has nothing to compare with
it, and we beliee not a city in Cali
fornia is possessed of such a serice
That it is an adertising medium of
great alue no one who has taken the
"Seeing ener" trip will doubt
Eery passenger was impressed by
that panorama of realities of the ast
resources  of Colorado We saw a
birdseye iew of ener, with its 180,000
inhabitants, of its productie alleys—
the rkansaw and Clear creek; of its
hoarded treasures of water for power
by the sight of Pike's peak lifting its
snowy crown 1,200 feet aboe sea leel,
at a distance of 75 miles away ; a alu
able practical lesson of what a little ir
rigation will accomplish in a seemingly
sterile soil On one side of a street in
ener the sagebrush land was seen in
its natie barreness; on the other side
a stream of water had Imparted itality
to dead land and had transformed it
into a flourishing nursery, which was
sending forth its fruit trees and other
products to eery part of the state
Colorado leads all sister states in min
eral output It will surprise many to
be informed— as the trumpeteer on the
"Seeing ener" car told us— that her
agricultural output een now far ex
ceeds her mineral output in alue This
"Seeing ener" plan of adertising is
one that might be followed with profit
by the large cities of California
We arried in St Louis Monday
night Hae taken today in getting
settled Hae taken a flying trip oer
the Fair grounds and the Pike, and ex
pect to commence systematically to

NOTES FROM
GOL MINES
Madeone— The mill will start about
the 10th of the month Eerything
looks faorable for a long profitable
run
Glenn — The Glenn is still shut
down owing to a lack 'of water The
Robinson brothers' lease expired on
the first of the month The mill will
not be started again before fall
Marsino Grael Claim —  This
claim is deeloping beyond expecta
tions The grael is carrying more
and heaier gold What is needed is a
small mill with which to crush the gold
bearing laa and the output would
doubtless bo much greater
efender— While the efender is
still a paying proposition Supt Joyce
concluded to sink and deelop the
property at a lower leel He has gone
down 20 feet during the last two weeks
which he considers good work owing
to the granite formation He will
probably sink 100 feet before running
any crosscuts The shaft will then be
00 feet deep Mr Joyce is ery Ban
gulne of success
South Eureka— Since our last
issue we hae learned from one high in
authority, in the management of the
mine, that 0 men are now employed
doing repair and deelopment work,
that the mill has undergone repairs
and will be running again before the
end of the present week, that
arrangements hae been made for the
erection of a new mill at an early date
and that since the election of the ' new
Board of irectors in March the stock
has increased 100% in alue
New Hap of mador County
 new map of mador county is in
process of construction and is about
half completed, and if a ery reason
able proposition, which will be pre
sented to the superisors at their next
meeting, be faorably considered, the
new map will be on the market in less
than 60 days The work is being done
by  C Carlton, an expert map maker,
who has been in the employ of the
Rand McNalliys of Chicago for years,
and has lately made maps of Butte,
Sutter, Yuba and San Joaquin counties,
and has a map to make of Santa Cruz
county He also made a small map of
Lodi, and there became acquainted
with Geo W LeMoin, the wellknown
hotel man of that place, and was in
duced by him to look oer the ground
in mador, as Mr LeMoin belieed
that as it had been some years since the
last county map was made a good up
todate map of the county would be ap
preciated by the public, and it is
wholly upon his representations to Mr
Carlton that mador county is ery
likely to hae a map that will fill all
requirements howeer exacting The
new map will be about x6 feet in size,
and scale 1} inches to the mile New
features will be the bounding of all
school districts and naming them
Complete maps of Jackson, lone, Sut
ter, mador, and Plymouth to occupy
the acant space on the map north and
south of the county These maps will
be drawn to a scale and show all streets,
blocks, lots, distances, etc, also all
telephone, telegraph, and power lines
lthough Mr LeMoin resides in Lodi
he always speaks of mador as home,
and that he takes a great interest in
the welfare of the county is shown by
the fact that he came up to Jackson
with Mr Carlton on Tuesday last and
personally used his best endeaors to
thoroughly introduce him, as far as his
limited time would allow, to the lead
ing people of Jackson and Sutter, and
to acquaint them understandingly with
details concerning the new map Mr
Carlton is stopping at the National,
and will be pleased to meet any one
who is interested in the work, and glad
to hae any data furnished that will
assist in producing a complete, accurate,
and comprehensie map of mador
county

Priate O'ay's
Humiliation
JMES FENNIMORE
ComirtOto, I**, 6 T C Mcaure
Priate O'ay, of the Tenth, had
shown pluck in seeral fights with the
Indians, and, therefore, stood well
with his officers He was a man who
always had a song in his heart or a
Joke on his lips, and he was, there
fore, a faorite with his fellow pri
ates Now and then he got tight, but
unless the officer of the day was
obliged to take official notice nothing
was heard from it Now and then he
was guilty of other breaches of disci
pline, but he argued his case so well
before the colonel that he was let ofi'
with a reprimand where another would
hae been sent to the guardhouse In
eery soldier company there is always
one such man— a good fighter when
fighting is to be done, but irresponsi
ble, good natured and totally careless
when in barracks
 funny thing happened one day It
was funny een to Priate O'ay, as
he tried his best to look at it in a
serious light He fell in loe with
Kitty Cline, the major's daughter He
fell in loe with her at a distance
clear across the parade ground at Fort
Sherman She had been at the fort
for three or four weeks, but that was
his first Bight of her She was eight
een and O'ay was thirty; she was a
major's daughter, used to a life of
luxury, while he was a high priate
on $13 per month The social gulf
between them was as wide as the t
lantic ocean, and O'ay knew it, and
whispered in his own earPersonal
"Patrick O'ay, ye are a bigger don
key than eer ye left behind ye in old
Ireland, and ye ought to be taken out
and kicked across the parade ground
The idea of losing yer heart to such
a gurl as that! re yez glttin' soft in
the top of yer head, or is It the foolish
ness just comin' out that yer dear
mother always contended was more
than yer common sense? Out upon ye
for a ninny, Patrick O'ay, and do ye
drie the major's darlin' out of yer
head and heart and make up to the
laundress of barracks No 3" ! *  ;;
But It was one thing to talk and an
other to do Priate O'ay was hard
hit— so hard that he could not keep his
secret, and when it became known to
a dozen of his comrades he was guyed
and jeered and berated by turns Two
or three days of it ought to hae work
ed a cure and sent Patrick along to bar
racks No 3, where the widow laun
dress of Company B, who was known
to hae $50 in the bank, would hae
welcomed him with smiles It failed,
howeer, and In his desperation the
soldier loer did a foolish thing Being
on sentry duty at tbe gate one day,
he remoed his cap and bowed to the
major's daughter as she rode forth
on her pony He did more He had a
twentyfie cent box of candy in the
bosom of his Jacket, purchased for the
occasion, and he hauled it forth and
begged her to accept it as a slight to
ken of his feelings toward her Of
course she looked down upon htm with
feelings of amazement and refused
his gift, and, of course, some one wit
nessed the performance and told of it,
and Priate O'ay was sent to the
guardhouse for making a monkey of
himself
The next morning the soldier, whose
loing heart had been deeply grieed
by the rejection of his confectionery,
was detailed to police duty along
with other derelicts, and that was a
further humiliation The finishing
blow was at hand fter some gen
eral work about the parade grounds
be was set to cleaning up the major's
back yard, Just where the major's
daughter could hae a full iew of
niru as he rolled the ash barrels about,
nd though he bad no cause to beliee
that she was peeping from a rear win
dow and chuckling oer his discom
fiture, the Iron entered his soul in
stead of the shoel entering the ash
neap He was sharply reprimanded
two or three times by the corporal, and
in his despair and desperation he out
raged military discipline by "sussing
back" He was ordered to report him
self at the guardhouse as under new
arrest, and it was while making his
way to that popular and well known
resort that he suddenly decided to
make a bolt for it  citizen had rid
den into the fort on a fine piece of
horseflesh and thrown the reins oer
a post near the gate, and Priate
O'ay reached and mounted the ani
mal and was galloping away before
the sentinel at the gate had opened
and shut his mouth
There was delay In following the
fugitie, and when pursuit was made
he had a long start, and his trail was
lost as he rode through the scrub to
ward eil's canyon It was 10
o'clock In the forenoon when he gal
loped out of tbe fort and it was an

him all the way The girl had done
a foolish thing to ride down into that
somber gorge, where the ; cinnamon
bear hid away for his noonday sleep
and great lizards crawled up and
down and hissed at the serpents, but
she was a girl of whims, and this was
one of them She not only entered the
canyon's mouth, but forced her won

the stony trail until she could no lon

ward She was halted there when the
thunder began to roll and the light
ning to flash, and she had not yet
turned her horse when Priate O'ay,
farther down and off his horse and un
der the shelter of a ledge, heard a
sound no man forgets after hearing it
once The big black cloud, with its
tens of thousands of barrels of water,
had hit tbe peak of the mountain and
burst, and the jar and roar of it was
followed by the swishing and swash
ing of a torrent coming down the can
yon The soldier had sprung for his
horse to mount and away when he
heard the clatter of the pony's hoofs,
and next moment the animal slipped
and fell at his feet and flung Us rider
oer its head O'ay saw that it was
a girl, but without knowing her iden
tity he picked her up us she lny in an
unconscious state, placed her on the
saddle before him and made the race

"My mon" snld the major to him
that afternoon after calling him to
headquarters "I want to shake hands
with you and call you a brae man
and tell you how grateful I am You
are released from arrest, and no new
charges are pending s to anything
further"—
"The widdy woman who launders
for barracks No 3 and has $50 in
bank promised an hour ago to marry
me, and there will be no 'anything fur

he saluted and turned on his heel
The Quarrel of the Humorists
Soon after Sir Francis C Burnand
became the editor of Punch he pub
lished a skit on George ugustus Sala
which cleerly burlesqued his methods
and manner Sala was connected with
the London Illustrated News s he
was distinguished alike for hufflness
and for geniality, there was much talk
about how he would take the joke
One eening Sala and Burnand met
at the Beefsteak club, and Snla, to the
mingled consternation and amusement
of the gallery, referred with indigna
tion to the article
"If I were younger," he said, "I'd
pull the nose of any man responsible
for such an article"
 peacemaker interened, to whom
Burnand remarked that personally he
did not think this or any matter in
journalism worth quarreling about,
but that if Sala felt so aggrieed he
could take the matter Into his own
hands • •
"I will!" Sala Immediately cried "I
willl"
nd, springing up excitedly, he car
ried out his intention— by wringing his
own nose, first with one hand, then
with the other Then, after murmur
Ing, "I apologize," he quietly sat down
Then it came out that the affair was
a farce planned and rehearsed, by Sala
and Burnand and that Sala had writ
ten the article himself
n dirondack Thief
t a certain dirondack cottage last
season something disturbed things frc 1
quently  jar of butter, set under the
house to keep cool, was broken into;
a tub of beef in process of corning was
robbed; a jar of suet on the back
piazza was tipped oer, broken and
some of the fat eaten, and many other
depredations of like character were
committed Seeral times the robber
had been seen in the eening by ladies
of the family, and to them he looked
so big that the male contingent deter
mined to watch for the thief and stop
his thieing Opportunity came one
moonlit night
Seen through a window and stretch
ed oer a pail in the shadow, the ani
mal looked big as a half bushel But
he could not be shot Just there, and so
the broken jar of suet was placed in
the moonlight in range of an open
window, and, gun in hand, the aenger
waited He did not hae to wait long
Quietly and with great dignity, as
though entirely within his rights, Mr
Coon came out of the woods again
right along the path to the house— and
stopped to regale himself with the suet,
60 easily found in its new place c
counts were squared when the shot
gun spoke— Forest and Stream
Honeymoon Hint*
o not forget, little wife, to pack up
a goodly store of books and work, aa
well as your pretty trousseau
o not, because it is just for once
in your lies, spend more than you
ought to either on the trip or for inci
fiental expenses Many a yoilug couple
after the honeymoon bitterly repent
their reckless waste of money
o not, een at this eentful stage
of your life, expect "the dear boy" al
ways to be by your side The loe
which he has for you, and which has
caused you to make him "the happiest
fellow on earth," will not admit of him
neglecting you, and his little atten
tions to others In public must be ac
cepted as mere conentionalities o
not forget that you hae left others
behind you to whom your marriage
has been almost as great a matter of
moment as to yourself— those whose
happiness depends upon yours In
epite of this new existence, in which
two lies are as one, you should find
time to write to them
o not fail to remember that in nine
cases out of ten the keynote of the
after married life is sounded during
the honeymoon— Boston Traeler

Old Leather BottJoo
Leather bottles, or  blackjacks, were
common in Europe two centuries ago
The bottles were j often made of one
skin doubled up and closely stitched
together, leaing an aperture for the
neck  Tba thick piece between was in
serted for the slip It was meant to be
slung at the back, a leather thong pass
ed through two loops placed on either
side of the neck, and it was sufficiently
flat at the base to stand when put
down The stopper was made of wood,
horn or old leather  good deal of
care was required in the preparation
of the leather, which had to be oiled
and worked with hammers to make it
supple and then washed with a lye so
that all the impurity was entirely re
moed, leaing the leather clean and
dry No moisture or air had any effect
on it Blackjacks were, in fact flagons
made in arious sizes They were
sometimes pitched Inside
The Moslem Girl
When she is twele or fourteen the
Moslem girl comes to know she is beau
tiful, though she does not marry at the
early age of the Hindoo girl She
counts the saris and Cholls and sighs
for fringes of pearls and modern dia
mond earrings she sees the friends of
her mother wear In her rose colored
eil and gold spots she is the prettiest
picture you eer saw With gazelle
eyes and siatic grace she is full of ar
dor and naiete at the same time She
runs like a fawn at the approach of ,t
stranger, but when unobsered hef
laughter rings through the house, and
tbe instinctie coquetry of her smiles
shows that the purdah is a necessity—

able honor to be asked to leae these

all the more eagerly because they be

'What Wrinkles Signify
Wrinkled foreheads In children be
token consumption, rickets or idiocy
Vertical wrinkles of the brow come
early to men who do much brain work
rched and crossing 'wrinkles about
the lower middle of the forehead be
token physical or mental suffering
Fine close meshed wrinkles which co
er the face, sign of age and decrepi
tude, are caused by loss of contractile

bathing, friction and electricity—t

Iteason Why Birds Hake Tolletl *
s bird fashions do not change, the
lady birds of today wear the same
kind of dresses their grandmothers
wore and are neer troubled about
style Two suits a year are quite
enough for most birds, but they need
to take great care of them Each sep
arate feather must be cleaned and look
ed oer and the useless ones pulled
out You hae seen a canary preening
his feathers by lifting them and
smoothing them out with his bill, and
you hae thought him ain to do this
so often If you neglect to comb your
hair it will become tangled and look
untidy, but more serious things happen
to a bird who does not comb his feath
ers These feathers are not packed
close together, you know, but lie loose,
and hae places between them filled
with air When a bird wants to get
warmer he lifts his feathers so that
these air spaces may be larger, but if
his feathers are tangled or wet and
dirty he could not raise them, and soon
he could not keep the heat in his little
body and would die, of course
The Sturdy Hn of Japan
The aerage Jap we see in Europe
gies no fair idea of the physique of
his people He no more represents the
aerage man of his people than does
the bouleardier represent the French
peasant  '
The aerage Japanese man, while
not tall, gies one the impression of
being probably the hardiest man on
earth He lies perpetually In the
open air and on the simplest food His
home consists of paper screens, which
neer shut the air wholly out and are
always open a great part of the day
He is hardy because he has been in
ured to the most extreme discomfort'
since infancy He does not know what
comfort Is His home has practically
no furniture Matting, bedding (no
bed) and a tray for food supply his
wants In a land cold beyond belief
oer a large part of the year he neer
has a coal fire, but warms himself oer
a box holding a few fragments of burn
ing charcoaL— London Mail
Origin of City Flans
ll cities, with few exceptions, trace
the origin of their plan to the inclosed
camp, and many still show marked
features of primitie fortifications In
all early scheme for defense the in
closed square was considered the best
From the time when wagons were
merely parked on the plain to the time
when buildings were constructed with
blank walls to the enemy, and their
facades to the open square, this plan
has been uniersally adopted, and
many of the great squares or market
places of great cities still show unde
niable eidences of these precautions
for defense In the old city of Brus
sels the square upon which faces its
wonderful city hall is approached by
streets so narrow that they mnst sure
ly hae been constructed with the idea
of defense In mind— rchitects and

The Stickleback Legend
The stickleback is one of the species
of fish that build nests There Is a
legend that the stickleback builds a
nest because during the deluge it
pulled the tow out of the bilge hole of
the ark, and if it had not been for the
hedgehog, who plugged up the leak
with his own body, Noah and his sons
would hae had an exciting time bal
ing out their boat When Noah found
out who had done the deed he ordered
as a punishment that the culprit should
be compelled each year to build a nest,
while other fishes would hae an easy
time of it
