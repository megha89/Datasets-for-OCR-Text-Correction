PRKER'S MISTKE
In his speech of acceptance Judge
Parker says of antitrust legislationPersonal
"What is needpd is not so much
other and different laws, as officials
haing both the disposition and the
courage to enforce existing law" _' ;
Oh; no that is not th»; need, for
the country has an official of
that kiud in Theodore Rooseelt
Witness what that democratic news
paper, the New York World, said on
this point after the supreme "court
confirmed the decision in the north
ern securities suitPersonal
The antitrust law was framed by
a republican, was passed by a re
publican house and a republican
senate, was signed by a republican
president
; The law remained a dead letter on
the statute books during the second
term of Groer Cleeland, a demo
cratic president Through those four
years of democratic administration
all appeals and all effoits of the World
to hae the law enforced were met
with sneers, jeers and open contempt
from a democratic attorney general,
Richard Onley, who pretended that
the law was unconstitutional, and who
would do nothiug towards prosecut
ing iolators of it
The first effort to enforce the law
was made by Theodore Roooseclt, a
republican president The first at
torneygeneral to igorously prose
cute offenders and to test the law was
a republican attorneygeneral, Phil
ander C Knox
TWO SOWERS
The Crops Produced, Respectiely, by
Groer and William
Behold our Uncle Samuel had a big
field to sow; wheroupoo he sent forth
into the field one Groer whose surname
was Cleeland to do the sowing nd
Groer straightway sowed the field
with the seeds qi FreeTrade, with a
remarkable crop resulting
For in due season the field was white
unto harest with a mighty yield of
bond issues in a time of peace, idle fac
tories, tramping laborers, Coxy armios,
ragged breeches, shanghai shadow
soup and poor prices eerywhere
 Then arose Uncle Samuel in the midst
of his wrath , and spoke  unto the
sower, sayiugPersonal
Groer, git epart unto the dun
geous of political darkness Hie thee
away to the shimmering waters of Buz
zards Bay, there to follow the gentle
craft of Sir Isaak Go quickly, ere I
dash my No, 13 into the midst of thee
rear rotundency nd Groer went
away sorrowful, for he had hopes of
great riches— and a third term
Then Uncle Samuel opened his mouth
again and saidPersonal "Son William, whose
surname was McKinley sow in my field
this year nd William went straight
way and sowed in the ery same field,
but he had good seed to witPersonal Protec
tion, sound money and such
gain the field brought forth abund
antly, but this time it was an oerflow
ing treasury, busy factories, employed
labor at increased wages, clothed, fed
and well paid people and good pay for
all produce
Then was Uncle Samuel made much
glad, and he smiled a smile of great joy,
and saidPersonal "I will hae this seed sown
in my field foreer more"
nd all the people were well pleased,
and shouted with a great shout sayingPersonal
Let this be true
Rooseelt Club
Clayton, N V, 190
The merican workman has no
desire to return to the emocratic
breakfast for food which he had on
his table for some years
The best appeal the democrats are
making to the country is based on
their promise not to disturb the re
publican legislatie achieements
The ingley law brought pros
perity and has maintained it for
seen years The persons who are
tired of prosperity can close it by
patronizing the emocratic ballot
box
The democratic argument this year
should be printed in the humorous
columns It is, in briefPersonal "You need
noi be afraid of us, for if we elect a
president and the house, the republi
can senate will keep us from doing
any damage
England is trying to shake off the
policy of free trade which has im
poerished her workingmen emo
crats, in the merican paradise of
the workingman, are trying to hae
us adopt the system which England,
after half a century of disastrous
trial, is now anxious to discard
HORSESHOE LUCK
 Superstition Common to Nearly
ll Races and Nations
The  origin of belief in "horseshoe
luck" is so ancient that it neer has
been determined with certainty, and
no superstition Is more uniersal Eer
since horses began to wear shoes those
crescents of Iron hae been accounted
lucky emblems of all peoples, races
and nations that hae been acquainted
with their use ?'%'
The Chinese, for instance, say they
nail 'them up oer their doors as a
charm against eil spirits because of
the' close resemblance in shape between
them and the arched body of the sa
cred snake, Nagendra, one of  their
principal deities j  
 sk a Turkish Mohammedan for in
formation on the subject and he will
tell you that it is because they are in
form  like a crescent, the sacred em
blem of Islam ' ; • u_r'
"r^rolish Jew will explain that at the
passoer the blood sprinkled upon the
lintel and doorposts, In the manner
directed by their ritual, forms the chief
points of an arch; hence, obiously,
the alue of arch shaped talismans
such as horseshoes are
The stolid and unimaginatie Rus
sian peasant, on the other hand, main
tains that the luck associated with the
horseshoe Is due chiefly to the metal,
irrespectie of its shape, iron being
traditionally a charm wherewith to
nullify the maleolent designs of eil
spirits and goblins
Very different is the story by which
the Irishman seeks to account for his
liking for the same tallsmanic symbol
The name "Ironland" or "Ireland," he
will tell you, originated as followsPersonal
The whole island was once submerg
ed in the sea, out of which it only rose
once in seen years, and then only for
a ery short time Many attempts had
been made to break the spell and in
duce the country to remain perma
nently aboe the waters, but all were
ain until one day a daring aden
turer threw a horseshoe from a boat
on to the topmost peak of the Wlcklow
mountains just as they were disap
pearing beneath the waes Then at
last was the ban remoed The Emer
ald Isle began forthwith to rise again
from the ocean depths into which it
had sunk nd it has been dry land
more or less— eer since
In England, up to comparatiely re
cent times, horseshoes were extensie
ly used almost eerywhere as anti
witch charms, and the custom Is not
een yet an extinct one No witch, it
used to be said, could enter a building
oer the door of whim a horseshoe—
or, better still, three horseshoes— had
been affixed, prongs downward
The origin of this particular belief is
referable to the old legend of St
unstan This ersatile English eccle
siastic was a skilled farrier, and one
flay while at work in his forge the eil
one entered in disguise and requested
unstan to shoe his "single hoof"
The saint, although he at once recog
nized his malign customer, acceded,
but caused him so much pain during
the operation that Satan begged him to
desist This unstan did, but only
after he had made the eil one prom
ise that neither he nor any of the less
er eil spirits, his serants, would eer
molest the inmates of a house where a
horseshoe was displayed
 ntch Fishing Village
t Marken, a fishing illage of Hol
land, few men are to be seen, as they
are nearly always out at sea In their
boats Those whom one does see are
like utchmen in a  play, In queer
headgear In the most oluminous
knickerbockers that eer delighted the
heart of a caricaturist and haing on
clattering wooden shoes, which are, as
a coasting skipper once said, the sur
est preentie of colds and of "cold
feet" (which he spoke of as if they
were a disease) to be found in the
world Clumsy enough these utch
fisher folk look, but they are handy
in a boat But there is agriculture, too,
of a simple kind at Marken Not a man
usually is to be seen working in the
hay harest or at other employment in
the fields The women do the farm
work
 LUCKY SHOT
Exciting? Moment In a Buffalo Hunt
In South frica
 hunter in South frica tells the
following story of an adenture with a
buffaloPersonal "I was in the act of descend
ing the bank when Prinsloo, a utch
hunter, who was lower down the slope,
saw the dark outline of the buffalo
standing at bay behind the screen of
reeds Next Instant, seeing It about to
charge, he shouted, 'aar kom hij !'
('There he comes!') and fired, rather at
random, I am afraid Then, rushing
down the path by which he had ad
anced, he threw himself headlong In
to the reeds on the left This all hap
pened in a few moments, but I had
sufficient time to raise my rifle to my
shoulder and fire as the enraged bull
rushed straight at me through the
reeds, with nose thrown forward and
horns back s I fired I endeaored to
jump aside to escape the charge, but
my feet got entangled in the matted
grass, and I fell on my back, luckily,
howeer, retaining my hold on the
stock of my rifle My first shot seem
ed to check him for a moment, but the
next he was rushing up the slope at
me I shall neer forget the look In
his fierce eyes It was but a moment's
work to draw back the bolt of my
Mauser' and to close It again, thus
pushing another cartridge Into the
breech I had no time to raise the
rifle to my shoulder There was barely
time, just before he was within strik
ing distance, to pull the trigger, with
the stock under my armpit, while I
lay on my back on the top of the slop
ing ground Without so much as a
groan he fell in his tracks and rolled
oer into the muddy water two yards
below with a great splash, shot through
♦he brain"

THE OSSETININS
 Race of the Caucasus Mountain*
With a Georgian ialect
In the highest parts of the Caucasus
mountains, around the Kasbeek region,
there is a tribe, ery tall and hand
some, which speaks its own peculiar
dialect of the Georgian language and
has its own peculiar customs, differing
in many ways from those of the
Tscherkesses, rmenians, Circassians
and other tribes that dwell in the same
country It is the tribe of the Ossetin
lans
Like the rest of the Caucasus tribes,"
they hae recognized Russia's authori
ty But they adhere to the claim that
they are not descended from siatic
races, like the other tribes, but that
their ancestors were German knights
who had gone to the crusades and who,
after the disastrous end of | the last
crusade, had been drien into the wild
alleys of the Caucasus, whence it was
Impossible for them to win their way
out and homeward owing to the ig
ilance of the Moslem foe Bo at last
they settled down and took wies
among the Caucasus mountain women,
who hae always been noted for their
beauty fj 7 > * 
It is a strange fact that the Osse
tinians understand the science of brew
ing malt liquors, and they are the only
ones who drink beer, the other tribes
preferring siatic liquors
THE WOR LIVERY
It Originally Meant Something e
liered or Freely Gien
Our word liery Is deried, through
the French, from the Latin liberare, to
delier Hence a liery originally
meant something deliered or freely
gien, and came to be applied to an
allowance of food or clothes
 From Norman times an English no
bleman allotted a fixed "lirery" of
bread, wine and candles to his serants
for their priate use  remnant of
this system still suries at Oxford
and Cambridge, where the fellows of a
college are entitled to a daily allow
ance of food called "commons"
n allowance of proender for a
horse was also called a liery, and a
horse fed and groomed for Its owner
at a fixed charge was said to be "at
liery"
In the middle ages "liery" was worn
by any one who was In any sense In
the serice of another of superior rank
or stntlon "V
The trading companies of the city of
London used to proide a special attire
for their freemen, who became known
as lierymen, a title which they still
retain
CIRCULTING LIBRRIES,
They Were Started by the Stationer*
of the Middle res
The earliest form of circulating li
brary was the lending out of books for
hire by stationers of the middle ages,
but this was of ery limited extent
In the reign of Henry IX, Richard of
Bury, bishop of urham, left his alu
able library for the use of Oxford stu
dents Two proisions are ery prac
tical, one being that no book was to gu
Into circulation unless there was a
duplicate; the other, that the borrower
had to deposit security exceeding the
alue of the book
! unfermllne, Scotland, established
the first proper library of this descrip
tion In 1711, Edinburgh following In
1725 with one founded by llen Ram
say Tbe first public one in England
was established in Salisbury by a
clergyman, Fancourt, In 170 This
failed to surie, but others In Bath,
and at London In the Strand, succeed
ed In becoming popular Many London
scientific societies established circulat
ing libraries In the eighteenth century,
and In the nineteenth they became far
more widely spread— London Globe

Isn't it singular how much heroism is
displayed by men In the discharge of
a dangerous duty and bow much cow

Ten Cents Per Copy
Old Maids
The true "old maid," like the true
poet, ' is born, not made, old maidish
ness being a question of innate char
acter rather than of incidental condi
tion There are old maids of eery
state and age and sex, says Ellen
Thorneycrof t Fowler, creatures who
reel in fuss, and batten upon detail,
and abide In the narrowest of narrow
ruts o we not all know married
women with large families who are,
neertheless, old maids to the back
bone, Just as we know adorable elderly
spinsters who hae the minds of girls
and the hearts of mothers? nd do we
not also know numßers of the (so called)
stronger sex whose absorption in trifles
and aidity for gossip proclaim them
old maids of the purest water?
CHURCH LES
n Old English Custom Th»t Vu
• Suppressed In 1603
From almost the earliest times In
England "church ales" were often gi
en in a building adjoining any church,
where were a hearth of good compass
and a stout oaken tabte upon which
the "ale" and iands were set forth
The founder of the feast gae his best
brew and was content to receie mon
ey in exchange, the spirit animating
these quasi religious symposia being
akin to that which obtains at the mod
ern charity bazaar— that Is to say, all
who attended were prepared to pay lib
erally or een dearly for their fare
Thus the man who had lost his mon
ey and was "down on his luck" would
gie a "bid (begging) ale" that, if he
was popular, might suffice to set him
on his feet again The more romantic
"bride ale" assisted penurious young
couples into housekeeping, while a pro
saic "Whltsun ale" was furnished by
churchwardens, who used to raise
money for the poor, for church repairs
or other pressing cause, the malt pre
iously presented to them and stored
In the tithe barns
ancing was indulged in at snch
"church ales," and if the season were
propitious an adjournment might be
made to an adjacent meadow, where
archery, quintain and other diersions
would ensue But excesses became
more and more frequent, so that In
1603 "church ales" were summarily
suppressed •'•;*;
THE GURIN OF OUR BOY
The foremost biologist of our day,
M Metsdinikoff, has shown the wctld
of science that there are leucocytes in our
blood that act as scaengers or policemen
These policemen which are called phago
cytes look out for the noxious or poisonous
elements in our blood Various offending
elements are picked out of the blood and
tissues by these policemen and destroyed
Therefore our lies are protected by
these bloodcellpolicemen, the phagocytes,
and we enjoy immunity from disease so'
long as our blood contains plenty of phago
cytes and red blood corpuscles
" new broom sweeps clean"— and in
order to put our own house in order *we
must get rid of all the poisons in the blood
with a new broom such as an alteratie
extract made from roots andjierbs — with
out the use of alcohol, as r Tierce's
Golden Medical iscoery, a specific for
making rich red blood— for eradicating the
poisons from the blood In some way the
policemen in the blood are increased in
number and strength — so that we are put
in the best possible shape to resist disease
— to cure neuralgia, colds, catarrh, and in
cipient consumption   •
"The more study and time is gien to the
subject the more we find that the blood is
the center of life "—says r K V Pierce,
the noted specialist of Buffalo, "the health
and comfort of the aerage person depends
entirely on this blood supply — for the heart
must hae pure blood or it will not pump
and keep the body supplied regularly like
the beautiful automatic engine it i The
neres must be fed on pure blood — or we
suffer the pain of neuralgia, which is the
cry of the stared neres for food Heart
aches, cold in the head, catarrh — and mary
other things are due to stagnation of th<»
blood"

THE REPUBLICN SUPERVISOR
TICKET
The republican conention that
assembled in Jackson last Saturday,
in the selection of candidates for
superisors in the* 1 arious districts,
did its full duty to tlu 1 taxpayers
In township two tb nominee was
irtually selected at the primaries
W M ,mick, Personal tbe present incum
bent, receied the indorsement of a
majority of his party, and that set
tled the controersy in his faor
No man, howeer conscientiously he
may endeaor to do his full duty as
a public serant, can hope to please
eerybody When an official acts
sincerely and openly, with a single
eye to the carrying out of his trust,
be will still find his pathway is not
free from thorns and obstacles
strewn by dissenters This is in
separable from public serice, and
must be classed among the un
pleasant features of officeholding
By the" erdict of his party con
stituents Mr mick has been as
sured of their confidence and sup
port, and we beliee the republicans
of the alley will accord him their
undiided support, and thereby en
sure his triumphant election
In township one the party has put
forward a strong man in the person
ofS W Pright Mr Bright has
been a resident and business man of
this town since pioneer days He
is a man of strong conictions, of
scrupulous regard for his word and
obligations, and of sound business
judgment He possesses in an emi
nent degree all the qualities that are
necessary to the discharge of the
duties of superisor It was for
this reason that he was sought out
and preailed upon to accept the
nomination He has always been a
stalwart republicau, but neer a
seeker after office This is the first
time in his career that he is a candi
date for office It is a cleancut case
of the office seeking the man, and
not tbe man chasing the office Now
that he has receied the nomination
he wants to win, and will exert him
self to that end The oters of this
district, without regard to party
politics, will recognize in Mr Bright
a man in eery way worthy of sup
port; one who cannot be swayed
from following his conictions by
any appeals of a personal or partisan
nature We confidently beliee that
the people of the district will elect
himPersonal We hae nought tosay against
his opponent, M Newman, who has
been in office four years, He is a
pleasant and agreeable gentleman,
whom we hold in bigb regard His
record as au official is before the
people, and eery oter must judge
for himself according to his indi
idual iews The Ledger, as a be
lieer in republican principles and
policies, and an adocate of republi
can candidates, asks the republicans
to stand by their nominee, because
be is in eery sense worthy of their
In township four Morris Brinn is
the republican candidate This is
the best selection that could hae
been made He filled the office the
preceding term, and his record —
especially in the work performed 1
upon the roads of his district — was
so satisfactory, that without opposi
tion tbe nomination was tendered to
him for the coining term It is uni
ersally admitted that he made a
better showing for the money ex
pended upon tbe roads than any
superisor the district has had
under the present system of road
superision In all other respect
Mr Brinn is a safe, reliable, and
conscientious man, and will conduct
the office on a businesslike basis
That be will be elected is admitted
by those best qualified to judge
THE SLRY GRB
The= Calaeras Prospect of last
week published au article concern
ing the position taken by the Ledger
in relation to the salary grab bill
introduced in the last legislature by
C H McKenney for the special
benefit of justices and constables
then in office Our cotemporary is
generally conseratie aud logical
in dealing with local questions, but
has made a ery indifferent showing
in defending this particular bill
We are aware that a bill of a similar
nature was passed for the benefit of
township officers in Calaeras coun
ty The Prospect asserts that in
that county the people are well sat
isfied with the new law, and pro
fesses to be surprised why such a
furore should be made in mador
county because of its proisions
The figures of the Ledger as to the
increased cost to the taxpayers by
the passage of this bill are indirect
ly questioned, but our cotemporary
makes bo effort to show by facts and
figures that we hae misrepresented
the situation We do not profess to
know the feeling in Calaeras coun
ty on this matter The justices' and
constables' salary grab has not
awakened the people there to the
same extent as in mador, probably
for no other reason than that its
proisions hae not been discussed
by the press There has been little
or no attempt to enlighten the citi
zens of that county on the subject
We hae nothing to tone down in
our strictures upon that infamous
bill The extent to which the tax
payers hae been' cinched by its
proisions will soon be a matter of
history, and beyond dispute The
Ledger is not of that stripe of
journalism that would eer one jot
from what it beliees to be right,
because a republican officeholder
and officeseeker is inoled in the
controersy We hae no hesitation
in asserting now that the justices'
and constables' salary bill introduced
by C H McKenney is the most
icious piece of legislation that has
come under our notice of all the acts
affecting mador couuty in the past
30 years Between the legislature
and the judiciary, our" taxpayers
hae been "buncoed"' out of thous
ands of dollars
It is nothing less than a holdup
under color of law The mere' mon
etary consideration, howeer, sink's
into insignificance "in comparison
with the moral aspect of the case
The graity lies in the fact that
officers sworn to uphold the consti
tution and the laws, hae, with a full
consciousness of the import of their
doings, deliberately and knowingly
endeaored to beat a constitutional
proision The resered rights of
the people, as set forth in the fun
damental law of our state, hae
been ruthlessly, knowingly set aside,
with hands uplifted at the selfsame
time in swearing allegiance to that
instrument The deep humiliation
of this moral tragedy must rankle
in the mind of eery belieer in the
majesty cf law Success along these
lines seres only to intensify the
dark features of tbe plot; and cou
gratulations on the outcome sound
like gloryings in public shame
Chairman Tajjgart, of the demo
cratic national committee, has stag
gered Parker by frankly informing
him that he has been doing a little
figuring on the presidential outlook,
an<J that doing his utmost for the
democratic nominee he cannot figure
out any prospect of his election
This remarkable instance of anti
election candor is haiug a ery de
pressing effect on the democrats

they cannot win

When the illage of Sutter Creek,

years ago by the announcement that

there was much whispering oer tea
cups as to the possible outcome of the
wedding For three or four days be

upon his solemn promise to marry ora

The wedding was performed the same

that Trudgen should at no time be re

the agreement binding formal papers
were drawn up to that effect, and after
the formalities were oer Trudgen
took tha train for this city, where he

Incorrect Report
Morris Brinn, republican candidate
for superisor in district four, was in
Jackson Wednesday He was called
to the county seat to hunt down a
slanderous report that has been cir
culated for tbe purpose of injuring him
before thePersonal oters, to the effect that
when he went out of office in 1901 he
had oerdrawn, or rather done work
on the roads which, if paid for at the
time would hae oerdrawn the funds
of that district to the tune of $3000
n examination of the matter from the
official records — the treasurer's books —
shows the following factsPersonal
In January, 1897 when Mr
Brinn assumed office, there '
was a deficit in the fund of $196 3
Jan 1901, when Mr Brinn went
out of office, thoro was a deficit
0f $50 53
Showing the fund was moreoer
drawn when he surrendered
office than when be assumed
office, to the extent of $25 10
This showing takes into consider
ation the bills outstanding for work
done at the close of S Pratt 's term in
1897, and tbe amount due for work
done at the close of Mr Briun's term
It takes no cognizance of the sums ap
portioned from the general road fund
at the commencement of each term
fter making all allowances the con
clusion is that Mr Brinn left the road
fund $2510 poorer than when he as
sumed charge nd tbia is explained
that 1901 was a seere winter Work
had to be done een if the funds of the
coming term were drawn upon to that
end ll superisors hae to pursue
this course according to circumstances

democrats to be true to the faith and
support the nominees of the party
The chairman felt proud of his county,
saw much in its management to com
mend, but thought it unwise and unfair
to those in power to too seerely con
demn eery fancied mistake The
chairman's remarks met with the ap
proal of the conention, as was
einced by the liberal applause gien
him V
Wm Ouids of township fie was se

The afternoon session began with
music by the band The arious com
mittees reported, the temporary officers
were made the' permanent officers, the
platform was adopted, which by the
way was ery short, simply reaffirm
ing the St Louis platform, pledging
support to Parker and ai9, and con
demning the management of the coun
ty hospital, pledging a more economical
administration of the affairs of that in
stitution in case the democratic super
isors were elected 
 Caminetti, R C Rust, R C
Bole, and  B Spagnoln turn ad
dressed the conention
 Caminetti assailed our canal pol
icy Was fearful lest the goernment of
France would be loser thereby Re
gretted that Napoleon had passed
away Wa9 afraid Rooseelt had set
a bad precedent in the Venezuelean '
affair Eulogized Parker 'atjd Clee
land Informed the conention that
Franklin K Lane had been elected
goernor of California by 3000 majority
and robbed of the position through the
action of incompetent superisors
throughout the state, and closed by
saying that as the canal had * been
started it should be completed This
latter statement brought forth ap
plause; the other generalities, falling
flat upon the ears of the listeners
Judge Rust spoke on imperialism,
antiChinose legislation, and the fitness
of a judicial mind for the presidency
 R C Bole grew eloquent oer des
potism in our island possessions, con
demned our European game warden,
and sat down amid the silence of the
conention that had failed to catch the
inspiration
 B Spagnoli longed for the return
of the good old times of 3 or 10 years
ago Rejoiced in the fact that he* had
always been a democrat, and pledged
himself to remain true to tho last
The following delegates to the state
and district conention were then an
nounced by the arious township dele
gates, and indorsed by the conentionPersonal

The different townships nominated
candidates for superisors as followsPersonal
Township One — M Newman
Township Two— J T Clifton 
Township Four —   Frasier
The chairman then announced that
before coming into tho conention hall
be had felt ery doubtful about Par
ker's election, but after listening to
the 6oul inspiring eloquence of the
arious speakers he had cast all doubt
aside, and felt that after the Blh of
Noember the Japanese would hae' no
trouble in securing the serices of
"Teddy" to lead their armies on to
ictory
fter naming one committeeman
from each oting precinct the conen
tion arose, and with bowed heads lis
tened to the familiar strains to them
of that popular tune, "Sailing down

The coming State Fair, which will
begin ugust 22nd and continue for
two weeks, promises to be a greater
success than for a number of years
past and the Horse Show at the Pail

undoubtedly proe a drawing card, as
it is the first one held at the Fair
There promises to be a strong compe
tition, between the horse fanciers of
San Francisco and other parts of the
State There will also be perform
ances gien at times in the ring which
will enlien and add to the attractions
of the show There will be some
sixty classes to be judged
t the park the harness races hae
been well filled and the prospect is
that a number of records will be
broken There will be more than a
hundred runners at the track, so that
the racing program promises well
The county exhibits and the mining
exhibits are expected to be ery large
and fine, and the big Pailion, which
coers a block, will hae ery little

11 E Church edication
edication serices at the remodeled
andenlHged M E church wer held
morning and eening last Sunday,
the Re Bishop J W Hamilton offic
iating The occasion drew a large
audience, not only from the interest
taken in the opening of the church,
but also because of the widespread
reputation of the bishop as one of the
most eloquent and deepthinking men
of the church The sermons were lis
tened to with deep interest, and made
a profound impression  statement
was made by the pastor concerning the
financial affairs, showing that a sum in
the neighborhood of $900 was lacking
to meet the cost of building the new
church, and to clear up the balance
due on the minister's salary t the
close of each serice, subscriptions
were asked from the congregation, to
pay off these obligations The call
was responded to nobly, and before
the eening serice was closed the
contributions promised ' amounted to
$925, which will suffice, making due
allowance for losses, to wipe out all
indebtedness

Three Inquests
 curious proceeding was had in re
lation to the inquest oer the three
ictims of the rgonaut accident The
same testimony would of course apply
equally to tho three cases It was con
tended, howeer, that one Inquisition
could not include the three ictims
So the testimony of the one case, 
Scatena, was transcribed by typewriter
thrice, 'and made to fit each case as a
separate inquest The only object of
this, that, we can see, was to get official
fees for three cases Instead of one It
was a useless proceeding, and the law
does not require a useless thing to be
done We can find nothing to show
that where seeral persons lose their
lies in the same accident, inquests to
the number of the ictims must be held,
and a distinct and separate report filed
for each case It is simply piling up the
costs, without any reason therefor
One of the maxims of jurisprudence is
that the law neither does, nor requires
idle acts The proceeding referred to
certainly faces in that direction, and
is a needless expense to the county

THREE MEN KILLE
T THE RGONUT
Supposed by a Premature Blast Caus
ed by efectie Fuse
The most disastrous accident we
hae been called upon to chronicle for
years, happened in the shaft of the
rgonaut mine about 11 o'clock Wed
nesday morning Four men, named
William J Curnow,  Scatena, M
Quinn, and William Jewell, were en
gaged in sinking operations It is cus
tomary to prepare from 18 to 22 holes,
and charge them; the last duty being
to light the fuse, each man lighting
one fourth of the fuses It takes not
more than from half to one minute to
do the work Naturally it is done
quickly, to enable the men to' get out
of tho way The fuses are 8 feet In
length, and they are timed to burn
about -1/2 minutes before the blast goes
off The kind of fuse used on this oc
casion is called the Insoloid fuse It
had recently been adopted at the rgo
naut because of its slowness in burning
It had been repeatedly timed, and
found more uniformly slow than other
fuses, and for this reason was used  It
comes in coils, 100 feet to a coil On
the occasion in question one of the
fuses burned with extraordinary quick
ness, the blast going off in fact before
the men had completed the lighting of
the other fuses Jt is supposed that
the three men killed, namely, Curnow,
Scatena and Quinn, were so badly
crippled by the premature blast that
they were unable to get out of the way,
and were thus exposed to all the suc
ceeding blasts, nine or ten in number
They were mangled almost beyond
recognition William Jewell, although
struck in the side by a piece of rock
the sizo of a walnut,  which plowed a
groe in bis back for 8 inches, managed
to make good his escape to shelter
after the Bret premature explosion oc
curred He is not seriously injured
s soon after the explosion as pos
sible the remains pf the three young
men who were sp suddenly pajled frpm
life to death, were brpugt)t tp tb,e sur
face It was a sight calculated to un
nere the stoutest heart to see the
mutilated remains of those who only a
few minutes before were in the full
igor of manhood's prime
The bodies were remoed as soon as
possible to the undertaking parlors of
WE Kent, to await the coroner's in
quest Coroner Huberty was away at
the time in thp mpuntalpe He was
sent for, and came down the same night
to conduct an inestigation of the awful
disaster
The particular brand of fuse is the
same that Is used In the Kennedy,
Oneida, and qtber mines arpund here
It had been selected because ft was re
garded as the safest and most unifqrm
It Is impossible tp detept imperfections
in a fuse frpm putward appearance
William Curnow had been the ictim
of seeral accidents in mines He lost
a portion pf his band by a mjshap in a
mine at mador City some years ago
He had been wpr|j jng at the rgflnaut
but a short time, wbeq he was caught
by a premature blast and laid up for
oer two weeks Upon his recoery
he asked superintendent J B Pranpjs
for a surface job, as he had been so
peculiarly unfortunate in underground
work that he was disinclined tp return
He was told that when opportunity
presented he would be gien employ
ment on the surface, and thereupon re
turned to work in the shaft, for the
first time after his preious accident,
on the fatal morning of Wednesday
He loaes a wife, who is in poor health,
also three children r^sicjipg jn Sutter
Creek He was pnly <}3 years p,f ape
eceased was a brpther of Mrs C p
Crocker of Jackson His bpdy was
not so mutilated as f,lie fitters,, t,foe
feature beiqg djstinguishabjePersonal
merigo Soatena was a young man
of about 18 years, a nephew of M
Scatena The remains when recoered
were fearfully mutilated The head
was completely gone, a blackened mass
of flesh and powder marked clothing
around the neck being left The body
was pitted with wounds where the rock
had been hurled against, jiji^ Whefl

who only two weeks agp gae birth \6
twin daughters, as aqnpunced in these
columns last week Hjs bpdy from the
shoulders down was sadly mangled
One foot was blown off, and otherwise
terribly disfigured The features were
recognizable
INQUEST
n inquest was held Thursday by
Coroner Huberty before the following
jurorsPersonal C M Kelley, G L Thomas,
J H Langhorst, U S Gregory, Chris
Curilich, L Glainpyich, Sim
cich, J qjqplifeltj W P ufrene
and W Mltphell  Wijliam Jewellj
the sole euripr, was unable to
leae his bed on accpunt pf the
injuries sustained The jury pro
ceeded to his residence on Water street
and heard his testimony He said he
was working in the shaft attending
chuck, his partner being M Quinn
They had drilled II holes, and the
other two, Scatena and Curnpw, drilled
11 holes on the opposite side ll fpur,
by common understanding, started to
spit, or fire the fuses tqgether While
so engaged one of the holes behind him
exploded He was thrown against the
wall by the shock They were all ip
darkness On getting up he was still
in darkness, and started tp climb the
rope to the ladder way, la feet aboe
From the ladder he elitnbed tp th,e sta
tion, JSO feet abfle, where thc skip
was In waiting fpr the men When, he
got to the etatipn the other explosion
occurred It was seeral minutes be
tween the first explosion and the other
blasts There was ample timo tp get
away if the men had been able tp sae
themseles after the first blast went
Off fter the fjrst blast his partner,
M\ Quinn, called out once to get a light
J B Francis, superintendent, testi
fied that the fuse used that da,y was a
German make, used In other mines
hereabouts, and adopted, after a
thorough test, on account of its slow
ness and uniform time in burning He
had tested it the day before
John Wilson, miner at rgouaut,
working at 1900 leel Neer tried the
new fuse here t Bisbee, rizona,
they used it altogether They claimed
it to be the best they had tried He
went down to the bottom after the ac
cident ll three were dead Scatena
was coered up with tine dirt Quinn's
body was lying exposed, bis head rest
ing on his arm Curnow was almost
buried in the debris; it took some time
to recoer his body from the loose rock
G J Troyan worked at 1900 leel
Heard the first blast, and said be would
time the fuse, to find how long it burn
ed Looking down the shaft he saw
lights at bottom, and just tbon the
first blast went off He belieed it was
3 minutes or 3j before the others went
off id not time them, be was too
excited Heard some one hollering In
shaft,' could not tell who it was 
few seconds C Oler came up the
skip after him, and told him that be
thought three men were blasted in
shaft
Chas Oler, at 2100 station, works
about the shaft at different points
Cut the fuses for the blasts yesterday
They were all 8 feet locg Neer, made
primings with new  fuse until yester
day Was at the bottom when they
loaded the holes There was trouble
In loading one hole, on account of a
rock falling in the hole; they had to
get the blpwpipe to clear it Would
not be certain whether Mr Curnow
put powder in the hole before blowing,
but think he did By the force of the
compressed air all the debris in the
hole, powder and rock, would be
blown out Heard man from bottom
of shaft call for light Could not tell
how many holes did not go off, nor
whether they were all spitted Belieed
only 9 or 10 holes exploded Found
fuses on the hanging after the ex
plosion id not know whether they
had been fitted to the holes Holes
did not explode Men that hae used
the new fuse recommenced it as the
best fuse Cpuld not say hqw the
premature discharge occurred Think
it must hae happened by blowing put
powder from the troublesome hplp, and
by lighting ths fuse ignited the powder
around the hole and in the shaft, and
thereby the explosion occurred be
fore all the boles bad been* lighted
id not beliee the fuse had time to
burn out
P Pescbia and others testified, on
th,e same !if)es The jury brpught ip a
epdlct In each case that death was the
outcome of accident
The sad affair has cast a deep shadow
oer the community The terrible
loss of life, and the ciruumstancus that
shroud the acpident in dpqbt ?s tp how
It occurred, helpipg to deepen the feel
ing of depression

On motion of Judge ais, r C 
Herrick was elected committeeman at
large, and chairman of the County
Committee, a position which he ha"s
filled ably and satisfactorily for the
past four years In accepting the po
sition r Herrick stated that he had
done his best in the past, and he would
fight for the success of the party in the
coming campaign to the utmost of his
ability, »
On motion the chairman was author
ized to appoint the usual committee as

E C Voorheis moed that the coun
ty central committee be empowered to
fill any and all acancies that may occur

filled by the committee as a whole and
not otherwise The motion was carried
Judge ais brought up the question
of the status of justices and constables
In townships 2 and  Seeral of these
officials, held their office by appoint
ment at the hands f the board of
superisors It was a question whether
the appointment would hold for the
unexpired term, or until the next gen
eral election The democratic conen
tion was discussing the matter, and the
preailing idea seemed to faor refer
ring the election of these appointed
officers to the decision of the people at
the ballot box The county committee
had power tp, fill acancies on the
ticket hy resignation or death of reg
ularly nominated candidates, but it
was doubtful if the authority reached
to the cases where the conention had
made no selection Nq defiqite aotion
was taken, but the Viestion was left
opeq tor future action if necessary
Each candidate nominated for super
isor was, on motion, required to pay

could neyer fully repay them He had
been asked to bs a candidate, and if

of the district It was surprising how
many bills intoduoed affected the dis

the people realized the importance of
sending a man capable of looking after
the district He promised to work
faithfully for thc best interests of the

ceied at the Zeila
Kennedy— The work of construct
ing a new furnace at the chlorination
works is being pushed ahead W L
Fortner is doing the mason work, and
E H Harrington is superintending the
construction It is the intention as
soon as the new furnace is completed
and started, to reconstruct the old fur
nace, by putting in new floors, and
practically making it oer anew This
plant has been in actie serice for 13
years — considerably longer than the
aerage life of such works Concen
trate's hae accumulated of late, as the
capacity of the works was inadequate
to keep pace with the output of the 60
stamp mill The new furnace will be
able to handle the output until the
additional 0 stamps to the mill are in
operation By that time it is expected
to hae both furnaces in working order
Zeila— The Zeila is receiing large
quantities of lumber and square tim
bers for shaft repairing and other pur
poses Between the Zeila and rgon
aut mines something like 900,000 feet
of lumber has been ordered; much of
it yet remains to be deliered Mc
Call's traction engines hae been haul
ing on this order for seeral weeks
The trucks are hauled from Martell's
to the mine by horse power; a traction
engine truck will carry a load of from
six to seen tons The Zeila mill will
soon be fixed to run by electric instead
of water power It Is probable that 30
stamps will be operated by electricity,
and 10 by water With the battery
water this will require about 5Q inohes
of water The running of a part of
the mill by water is imperatie to
carry off the tailings

BLOTTING PPER
It 'Was Known and Used as Par Bach
as the Year 1075
There is a pretty prealent belief that
blotting paper is a modern inention;
that a hundred years ago it was un
known, white sand being used in Its
stead
Blotting paper, as a matter of, fact,
was a recognized conenience of the
•Titlng desk as far back as 1C75 In
that year there was issued a book called
"Townsend's Preparatie to Pleading,"
a copy of which is in the possession of
a Chicago antiquary, and this olume
contains on page 8 the following para
graphPersonal
"Let the dusting or sanding in books
be aoided, rather using fine brown pa
per to preent blotting if time of the
Ink's drying cannot be allowed, for
sand takes away the good color of the
ink, and," getting into the backs of
books, makes them break their bind
ing"
The sand that was used for blotting
in the past was, the Chicago antiquary
says, ery clean and white and fine,
and it was called Biler sand It was
kept in a cruet with a perforated lid,
like a salt cruet, and thence It was
sifted oer the wet writing n odd
thing about it was that the ink neer
seemed to stain it It could be used
oer and oer and It remained to the
end as white as snow
BTTLE STNRS
So ncient That Their I'se Is Men
tioned In the Bible
 The custom of carrying flags or stand
ards in battle dates back at least to
190 B C We find in Numbers 11, 2,
that "eery man of the children of
Israel shall pitch by his own standard
with the ensign of his father's house"
Each standard of the twele tribes thus
distinguished was supposed to hae
been of a color to correspond with the
stone in aron's breastplate which
bore the name of that tribe Under the
generic name banner are included many
species, such as standard, ensign, pen
non, flag, etc These hae been used
from earliest times and in all countries
to direct moements of troops
The earliest Roman standard was
a bundle of straw fixed to the top of
a spear This was succeeded by fig
ures of animals, such as the horse and
the boar, which soon gae place to the
eagle, the chief Roman ensign, after
ward assumed by the German and
French emperors By eery warlike
people the banner hns been regarded
as an emblem of national honor, In de
fense of which each soldier was at all
times ready to die, while banners and
flags taken from the enemy hae al
ways been special trophies of ictory
to which places of honor in public
buildings hae been assigned
BOOTS N SPURS
Qnalnt ccount of Hungarian Cay
alry In Olden ays
 contemporary manuscript account
of the diet of Ratisbon, held in 1630 by
the Emperor Ferdinand 11 on the oc
casion of the landing of Gustaus
dolphus of Sweden i Germany, men
tions as a remarkable fact that the
Hungarian caalry who rode through
the streets to the ceremonial wore their
spurs on their boot soles
It^is difficult to credit that these
spurs were fixed on the flat of the boot,
for thus shod the horsemen could nei
ther walk nor stand, especially when
the large size of the spurs worn at the
period is considered Probably the
writer intended to indicate that in
stead of being fastened to the heel in
the usual fashion they were made to
project from the fore part of the mili
tary boot, which is a  portion of the
sole
Frederick yon Raumer, who quotes
this in his "History of the Sixteenth
and Seenteenth Centuries, Illustrated
by Original ocuments," passes the
matter oer without comment The
same manuscript adds that tbe Hunga
rian horses had their manes, tails and
feet painted red
ncient rinking Gnilds
It is graely said by an authority
that the utch guilds, the most ancient
of worltingmen's organizations, had
their origin in the drinking guilds,
which, although they did not, as in the
case of Uie Greeks and Romans, exalt
drink to the rank of a deity, made it a
kind of^ciic dignitary These drink
guilds and drink brethren existed from
the earliest times until the latter part
of the sixteenth century, when their
excesses led to their suppression It Is
held that men who worked together
drank together and thus formed the
primitie club which deeloped into the
guild— Notes and Queries
Hose of Olden Time
In the ery long ago hose were not
stockings as now worn, but made long
and were often drawn up een to the
Waist, and, oddly enough, had pockets
in their sides We read, moreoer, that
In the time of the Tudors and Stuarts
they were of great ariety, both of
material and color, and for such as
could command the luxury were rich
ly trimmed and costly; they were often
called "nether stocks"

THE SNIPE'S'RUMMINQ
 Naturalist's Theory as to How the
Sound Is Produced
It is disputed whether the snipe'a
drumming— a curious noise, suggestie
of a miniature thrashing machlne^ — is
made by the bird with its wings or by
its tall or by both wings and tail
Some recent obserations incline me
strongly to beliee that the tail plays,
at any rate, the more important part
uring the performance the bird flies
at a great height round and round in
a wide, sweeping circle t interals
he makes a sudden and rapid descent,
holding his wings partly flexed and his
tail spread to Its full extent The out
ermost tail feather on either side points
outward at a greater angle than those
adjoining it, so that when the bird is
watched through n good field glass day
light shows between it and the next,
and, if I am right In my iew, the
drumming sound is due to the rush of
air against this isolated feather The
snipe's tail feathers seem so puny that
It is at first diflScult to beliee that
they can produce so great a result But
if an outer one be taken— it is slightly
scimiter shaped, with the outer web
much reduced — and swung rapidly
through the air tbe drumming noise
may be distinctly heard, though it
seems but a ery faint echo of the
loud, throbbing hum that startles one
when It suddenly descends from an
ethereal height, and the small bird is
descried, hardly more than a speck to
the naked eye, circling round in wild
career and now and then swooping
headlong downward and thrilling the
air with his weird music— London Na

THE LITERRY ETECTIVE
Hla Hunt Is One That dda Spice to
His Reading
There Is a certain type of literary
man who seems content to take little
part in the struggle of letters beyond
keeping an eye on his contemporaries
and pouncing down on them eery now
and then to accuse them of hating
gien a meaning to such and such a
word which that word should not pos
sess It is strange that the number of
these literary detecties is not larger,
for there are few more fascinating oc
cupations than this It lends a spice
to one's reading The dullest book be
comes as readable as the most deftly
written noel Certain words hae tak
en to themseles meanings in the
course of time which they hae no
right to possess "Phenomenon" is a
ery hardened offender To use this
word as meaning something "strange"
Instead of something "that appears
and is isible" is to insure arrest at the
hands of the detectie Lately the
word "temper" has been exposed
Through long Impunity It has come to
imply bad temper, whereas, if it had
its rights, it should mean Just the re
erse We strongly adise eery one
who desires a neer failing source of
amusement to read the next noel he
takes up with the eye of the detectie
Starting with the easier words, like
"phenomenon," the noice may go on
from strength to strength until before
long nothing can escape him The ex
ercise, moreoer, is not only a pleasure,
but a duty— London Globe
Why Wlndmilla Burned own,
Of the production of flre by the fric
tion of wood against wood windmills
of the old construction gae on a large
scale some disastrous examples When
the force of the wind increased the
miller was obliged to bring each of the
sails in succession to the ground in or
der to unclothe it, but when sudden
squalls came on this was impractica
ble, and tbe mill in extreme cases ran
away— that is, could not be stopped
Eerything was now done to increase
the grip of the wooden brake round the
great wheel dn the driing shaft, and
water was poured copiously oer them,
but in spite of all this flames would
sometimes burst out from the intense
friction and the mill be probably
burned down as the result The beau
tiful machinery of the modern wind
mill, by which the miller controls the
action of the sails from the interior of
the building, has reduced this danger to
a minimum— Notes and Queries
Memory
There are 100 different arieties of
memory, and perhaps we cannot alto
gether choose which we will possess,
though eery sort, when we hae the
germs of it, may be cultiatedPersonal To
learn anything by heart the best plan
is to read a sentence and repeat it
without a book, then read the next
Fentence and repeat the two, and so
on Repetition is of great importance,
"line upon line" More is learned and
remembered by reading through one
book twice than by reading two books
once fter a thing has been learned
it must be recalled and gone oer at
interals, or the impression will fade
away
Spats
Where did spats come from? High
land soldiers wore them first Because
of the braery of higblanders at Luck
now and elsewhere in India during the
Indian mutiny the people of England
looked about for some way to show
their admiration Scrutiny of the high
land dress disclosed that spats were
the most suitable for adoption, so they
were adopted and hae been commonly
worn eer since

THE SKYLRK'S SONG
N STONISHING FET FROM MNY
POINTS OF VIEW 
Not lone Is It a Wonder of Melody,
Tone and Quality, but Its Volume
Is stounding and Its Circumstance
of Utterance a Physical Marel
For its music alone the song of the
lark Is almost the most melodious of
any bird's  The tone and quality are
admirable and the olume of sound as
tonishinc It can be heard clearly
when the lnrk has mounted, as It
sometimes does, beyond recognition by
normal eyesight The olume of sound
is also most noticeable when a caged
lark Is heard, singing as it does far
nearer to the hearer than the bird in
the sky But apart from the quality
and music of the song the circum
stances in which it is uttered render
it an astonishing feat
Eery other considerable songster is
quite aware that singing entails much
physical effort Consequently It takes
care to secure a good platform to sing
from  thrush or a blackbird or a
robin nearly always selects a top shoot
or projecting bough, preferably a dead
one, on which it sits and sings, neer
moing its position, and without any
objects round it to hinder the carry of
its oice The blackcap and nightin
gale and some of the warblers sit in
a bush to sing, but the whitetnroat
and een the hedge sparrow choose
the topmost twig The whltethroat
sometimes sings when descending, and
some of the pipits and the wood lark
do the same, the meadow pipit singing
a feeble little song as it makes a short
ascent and descent
But to the strain on its lungs of long
protracted song the lark adds the great
muscular exertion of a steady upward
flight, usually carried out not by scal
ing the air in gentle circles, as in the
soaring of the larger birds, but' by a
ertical climb made by the incessant
beating of  Its wings Wordsworth's
recognition of it as the
Type of the wise who soar, but neer
roam,
True to the kindred points of heaen and
home, "Personal'"*
is often almost literally correct fter
two or three spirals the bird goes up
almost as if it were drawn heaenward
by a cord, and then, closing its wings,;
descends like a falling stone to the
ery point from which it rose The
strain upon the muscles and the lungs
would be great if during all this time
it were silent ,But it chooses to add
to the exertion of soaring that of pour
ing forth a continuous flood of sweet
notes with no intermissions or breaks
whateer
 lark will soar and sing during a
space of ten minutes consecutiely The
rapidity with which the pectoral mus
cles are working during this period
may be Judged from the fact that the
bird makes not less than from fie to
six beats of the wing per second The
beats are usually in sets of from three
to fie, the bird pausing for a moment
as if to take a fresh start after the
interal When chased by the merlin
falcon, skylarks make their finest ex
hibitions of flight, ascending into the
air to heights which hae been esti
mated as being not less than a thou
sand feet Sometimes 'the bird uses
the same means of ascent as when it is
soaring and singing, rising ertically
by incessant beats of the wing In the
language of the falconer, these are
termed "mounting" larks, and their
object is to outfly the hawk directly,
shaking off its pursuit during the as
cent Others prefer to rise by flying In
a spiral, which the falcon imitates
Mr E B Michell, in his olume on
"The rt and Practice of Hawking,"
saysPersonal "The one bird may be circling
from right to left and the other from
left to right, and neither seems to guide
the direction of its rings by atiy refer
ence to those which the other is mak
ing It is now a struggle to see which
can get up fastest, and it is astonish
ing to see to what a height such flights
will sometimes reach s soon as a
lark is 800 feet high it can drop, almost
like a stone, into any coer within a
radius of 200 yards from the spot Just
under It, allowance being made for the
effect of the wind But 800 feet is not
high for a ringing flight; at least there
is nothing unusual about it  lark
does not go out of sight until it Is
much aboe that height, and it is no
extraordinary thing for it to do this"
The lark seldom sings late in the day
It can be tempted to rise In a burst of
melody for one final ascent if the een
ing sun breaks through the clouds after
rain, but as a rule it is silent long
before the sun has descended into the
western bed of cloud We hae Mil
ton's authority that it is up and in song
before dawn But those who hae
Heard the lark begin Its flight
nd singing startle the dull night
are not easily found, though in the
height of the pairing time it may ery
possibly be beforehand with aurora in
greeting its mate But as a rule the
lark sings at sunrise, as the ortolan
cats arkness depresses it and keeps
It mute, but a gleam of sun is tbe sig
nal for it to ascend Obiously rain
would make It most difficult for it to
Boar, both by adding to the weight of
Us body from the moisture caught in
the feathers and by wetting the webs
of the pinions, so the lark only soars in
the dry as a rule It is one of the most
sensitie and best of nature's weather
gauges, for when the larks begin to
sing it is almost certain that rain has
ceased for some time, If not for the
day It is the cock lark which sings
William Cobbett noted that one was
Just soaring and beginning to sing
When the ben flew up and eidently
told him to stop, for she fetched him
flown again— "an instance," says Cob
bett, "of tnat petticoat goernment
