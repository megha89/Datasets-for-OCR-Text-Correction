Vodern Conditions Killing; the Sles
ta Habit In Mexico
; There arc people in Mexico City who
take their afternoon nap eery day,
and are greatly benefited thereby, but
their number appears to be growing
less year by year Whether the siesta
Is beneficial or not, or whether in this
high' altitude it is a necessity for many
persons, as is claimed by some, its
death knell as a general custom seems
to  hae been sounded since the city
adopted its modern enterprise and
push Many old residents will tell you
of the time when a person in the city
of Mexico would hae been considered
almost crazy if he neglected his after
noon rest, but gradually, with the ad
rent of the railways, the street cars
and the electric lights, came the in
eitable sleeplessness which is one of
the most noticeable characteristics of
morlern ciilization
'T&iere are seeral supporters of the
siesta idea in this city who express re
gret that the custom appears to be
passing away These persons, who are
themseles deotees of the practice,
claim that it is a healthful and nere
restoring habit and that if It were In
dulged in systematically by the people
of the United States and other pro
gressie countries there would be few
er cases of nerous wrecks for the
newspapers to report "Early rising
and a short nap after dinner" is what
these people adocate, claiming that

FIRST USE OF TE
n ncient Legend scribes It to a
King of China
By whom or when the use of tea for
drinking purposes was first discoered
is lost in antiquity It Is spoken of as
a famous herb In Chinese literature aa
far back as 2,000 years B C, at which
time its cultiation and classification
were almost as thorough and complete
as they are today One of the ancient
legends says that its irtues were ac
cidentally learned by King Shen Nung
She, the Chinese monarch who is also
known as "the diine husbandman,"
who, the record 6ays, flourished forty
centuries ago He was engaged In boil
ing water oer a fire made of the
branches of the tea plant and careless
ly allowed some of the leaes to fall
into the pot ?,'
The liquid which he expected to come
from the essel simply as sterilized
water was miraculously conerted into
an elixir of life by the accidental ad
dition of the tea leaes Boon after It
became highly esteemed in all the ori
ental cities and was used as a royal
gift from the Chinese monarchs to the
potentates of southern and western
sia
This same King Shen Nung She not
only earned the title of respect by
which he was known through the dis
coery of the irtues of tea, but be
cauEe of being the first to teach his
people how to make and use plows and
many other Implements of husbandry

Young Plants
Eery farmer knows that
some plants grow better than
others Soil may be the same
and seed may seem the same
but some plants are weak and
nd that's the way with
children They are like young
plants Same food, same home,
same care but some grow big
and strong while others stay
small and weak
Scott's Emulsion offers an
easy way out of the difficulty
Child weakness often means
staration, not because of lack
of food, but because the food
does not feed
Scott's Emulsion really feeds
and gies the child growing
strength
Whateer the cause of weak
ness and failure to grow —
Scott's Emulsion seems to find
it and set the matter right

n Incident of the ustroPrusslan
war of 1866 was told as follows by the

army," said the archduke, "we camped
In the neighborhood of a Bohemian
town I was lodged In a peasant's cot
tage when about midnight I heard the
sentry challenging some newcomer
My adjutant entered and reported that
a gypsy wanted to see me In priate
 soldier (a gypsy) entered, and on my
asking what was the matter he told me
that the enemy was approaching tt
surprise us
 '"The outposts hae not heard any
thing suspicious,' I said 'No, youi
highness, because the enemy is still a
long way off' 'But how do you know
this?' I asked 'Come to the window,
your highness,' answered the man 'c
you see those birds flying oer the
wood' toward the south?' 'Yes, I set
them What, then?' 'What, then? c
not birds sleep as well as men? They
certainly would not fly about if they
were not disturbed The enemy U
marching through the wood and hai
frightened all those birds'
"'Very well, my lad You can go 1
I at once ordered the outposts to be re
enforced and the camp to be alarmed
n hour later the outposts were fight
ing with the enemy, and our camp was

Santa nna was the greatest military
leader the Mexicans hae eer known
Santn nna with 25,000 eterans went
to the battle of Buena Yltstn with the
aowed purpose of exterminating the
entire army of the United States, and
there was no doubt in the mind of
Santa nna that this great feat could
be accomplished with comparatie
ease General Taylor, with his OOOC
men, prepared for the unequal contest,
and not only defended himself success
fully, but won a substantial ictory

droe them  from the battlefield ol

Some time after the battle was fought
and the Mexican war concluded Gen
eral Taylor was criticised for haing
made no preparations for the retreat
of his army In the eent of defeat
General Taylor promptly repliedPersonal "I
made eery preparation necessary foi
the battle of Buena Vista I wrote my
will, fnd so did nearly eery man in
my army If we had not won that
battle, we would hae needed no lines

Curious comments by a judge, een
in the presence of the prisoner, though
extremely rare, are not unprecedented
Mr Justice Maule once addressed a '
phenomenon of innocence in a smock
frock In the following wordsPersonal "Prisoner
at the bar, your counsel thinks you In
nocent; the counsel for the prosecution
thinks you innocent; I think you Inno
cent But a jury of your own country
men, in the exercise of such common
sense as they possess, which does not
seem to be much, hae found you

upon you the sentence of the law
That sentence is that you be kept In

day was yesterday you may now go

REPUBLICN SCENNCY N
PROSPERITY
Our democratic exchanges are
trying, to reason themseles into the
belief that tbe remarkable prosperity
the country has enjoyed under re
publican rule is due to other causes
than the republican policy of pro
tection They want the people to
beliee that their plan of carrying
on the goernment on a tariff for
reenue basis is not destructie to
public interests True, they hae
to admit with reluctance the fact
that under democratic control busi
ness interests throughout the coun
try hae become depressed,, while
under republican sway business im
proed They try to get around
these facts by saying that the hard
times under Cleeland commenced
during theclosing year of the pre
ceding republican administration
If that were true, it affords no ex
planation that is encouraging from
a democratic standpoint Coming
eents cast their shadows before
When Cleeland was elected the
prosperity of the country under the
Harrison administration was arrest
ed Business men at once started
to set their houses in order for the
coming chauge The same spirit of
precaution that leads tbe captain to
prepare for tbe oncoming storm, in
duced the captains of industry also
to proide for the fiscal change that
democratic control was pledged to
bring about ccording to demo
cratic pretensions a fatalism seems
to hedge about that party They
hae always managed to get into
power when the tide of prosperity
had passed the flood mark, and had
commenced to ebb It was a case
of illluck, all the more remarkable
in that the ebbing tide remained
with them during the whole term of
their ascendancy On the other
hand, the return wae of prosperity
immediately started as soon as the
republican party was restored to
power  few figures will not be
amiss to show the effect of the two
policies Telegraphic messages are
an infallible index of the condition of
a country In prosperity they in
crease in numbers; in adersity the
business men aud others curtail this
costly method of communication as
much as possible In the year end
ing June 30, 1833, the number of
telegraphic messages was 76 mill
ions In 189, uuder the democratic
administration, the number fell to
(J9 millions, and made little headway
under Cleeland's term, the aerage
per year being about 70 millions
In 1902 the number reached 89 mill
ions eposits in United States
banks aeraged four and a half
billion dollars in the four years of
democracy, while in 1902 they were
9J billion dollars — more than double
the aerage of the preceding term
In 1892 the alue ot farm animals
as reported by the department of
agriculture was $2,61,000,000; in
1897 the alue was placed at $1,655,
000,000; i 1901 these animals were
estimated by the department to be
worth $3,000,000,000 In this" rise
and fall in alues, incident to change
of party administration, there is
food for serious thought
The same trend is stamped upon
eery department of trade The re
publican years were years of plenty;
the democratic years were years of
famine and shrinkage bout the
only thing that flourished in demo
cratic times was the insolency busi
ness In 1892 the failures i the
United States amounted to $11,
000,000; in 1893, the first year of
democratic rule, the liabilities of
bankrupts were $36,000,000Personal while
in 1901, when the country had again
settled down to republican suprem
acy, the amount was $113,000,000
I  1893, when Cleeland was in
augurated the second time, the wool
crop was 36,000,000 pounds; in
189 it was 328,000,000, and in 1895
26,000,000 pounds, inoling a loss
in two years of $60,000,000 to the
sheepowners

Folitical Notes
It is now definitely understood that
John Strohm is to be an independent
candidate for superisor in township
one He was an aspirant for the nom
ination, on the democratic ticket; fail
ing to receie the honor, he has been
preailed upon to run independent,
with the backing of the miners' union
The same remark will apply to the
candidacy of H  Calin in township
four He wanted to run as a demo
cratic candidate He failed to show up
enough otes to capture the prize at
the democratic showdown, 60 he ap
peals to the oters for redress It is
reported that J Pengilly is also a
candidate, on an independent basis
The people of township four cannot
complain of a lack of ariety Morris
Brinn is the only tried man before tbe
oters He has made an official record
as superisor; on that record he has
been renominated by his party; and on
that record he confidently looks for
support at the polls
Monday next being labor day and a
public holiday, the regular meeting of
the board of superisors will be held on

Those Three Inquests
Editor mador LedgerPersonal— ln your
article in last week's Ledger entitled
"Three Inquests, " you say, l We can
find nothing to show that where se
eral persons lose their lies in the same
accident, inquests to the number of
ictims must be held and a distinct and
separate report filed in each case" I
do not think there is any law to
authorize such a proceeding In fact,
with respect to the accident at the
rgonaut mine, but one inquest was
held and one erdict rendered The
accident referred to is not the first of
tbe kind that has happened in this
county" within llio last few years
On the first day of January, 189",
two men were killed at the Goer mine
by a similar accident On tbe same
day I, as county coroner, held an io
quesl upon the bodies, and reported
the case as one inquest It neer oc
curred to me that it was necessary to
report two inquests
On the 25th day of ugust, 1897, I
held an inquest on the bodies of three
persons who were burned to death at
the Wieland mine in this county 
jury was summoned, and after iewing
the bodies and bearing the testimony
adduced, they rendered a erdict
as followsPersonal
"We find that the name of one of the
deceased was Mrs S F Craighead,
and of the others the name of one was
lin Herbold, and of the other John
Walter Herbold ;' that Mrs S P
Craighead was a natie of Missouri,
aged about 9 years; that the said
lin Herbold and the said John
Walter Herbold were naties of the
state of Noada, the said lin Her
bold being 8 years old at tbe time of
his death, and the said John Walter
Herbold 6 years old at the time of his
death ; that they all came to their death
on the 2th"day of ugust, 1897, and
that their deaths were caused by burn
ing, they haing been accidentally
burned to death in the boarding house
at the Wieland mine"
I reported the case as one iuquest, as
in fact it was, and charged the usual
fee for one inquest only
The members of the board of super
isors are intelligent men, and I do not
see how they can allow fees for three
inquests on account of the accident at
the rgonaut mine, when but one was
required or held

Nothing in It
The San Franc'sco Chronicle of Mon
day last contained an article, eidently
written by a reporter in the city, gi
ing an account, of an anarchist being
run out of Jackson by indignant citi
zens The indiidual thus treated
Colorado fashion is said to bean Italian,
who was actiely engaged in spreading
the tenet of anarchy among the for
eign born population of this town The
publication of »uch an article came as a
surprise party to the law abiding peo
ple of Jackson It was the first inti
mation that anything of the kind had
taken place here The truth is, the
Chronicle in this matter has been made
the ictim of the worst kind of a fake
story There is no truth whateer in
the deportation yarn The only part
of the story that is true is that within
the past three mouths two persons ar
rested for felony — one for mayhem and
the other for assault with a deadly
weapon — were turned oer to the fed
eral authorities for deportation under
United Statoa laws which forbid the
immigration of foreigners of tbe crim
inal class, or persons imbued with an
archistic doctrines They were taken
from this county by peace officers, and
in accordance with judicial authority;
There is no apprehension here con
cerning the teachings of anarchy, and
not the least fear that this gospel of
ruin will attain strength that any re
pressie measures such as deportation
will be resorted to or countenanced

Fell own the Shaft
William Mobley, son of Re  
Mobley, formerly principal of^ the
Stockton high school was killed in the
Gwin mine last Saturday morning, by
fallig down the shaft The Stockton
Independent has this to say of the
accidentPersonal
The particular cause of the accident
will perhaps neer be known ll that
is known is that with fie other men he
was being lowered to the 2000foot leel,
and when about 200 feet down he fell
from the "go deil" to the bottom The
space in that part of the eleator is just
beneath what in miners' phrase is called
the skip It is so limited that the six
men who were being lowered had to
stand back to back  For this reason
his fie companions could not see what
happened preious to his fall They
heard his lunch basket fall and felt him

Tbß Fatal ccident at the rgonaut
The fatal accident at the rgonaut
last week, causing the instant death of
three men by a premature explosion,
has naturally created some nerous
ness among some of the employes in
sinking operations The depression
resulting from such a disaster will re
quire some time to remoe It is now
pretty well settled that the accident
was not due to any defect in the fuse
The miners who are daily using the
same fuse, and prefer it to all other
brands on the market, do not accept
the theory of a defectie fuse n ex
amination of the shaft bottom after the
debris of the fatal explosions was
cleared away, reealed a' condition of
affairs that throws some light on the
matter ll the holes on that side of
'the shaft where M Quinn and W
Jewell were working were exploded
On the other side, where W J Curnow
and  Scatena had worked, only one
hole exploded 1  That was the hole
which they had had difficulty in load
ing, and which they had to resort to
the blowpipe to clean out By this
explosion a small portion of that side
had been blown out, and it is supposed
that the holes had mostly, if not all,
been primed and lighted, but that the
fuses of the unexploded holes had
been blown out by the premature blast
The generally accepted explanation of
the accident is either that this fuse
had been accidentally lighted, or that
in cleaning the hole the powder had
been scattered around the mouth of
the hole, and the hole had afterwards
been insufficiently tamped or closed;
that the lighted fuse communicated to
the dry powder, which formed a train
to the cartridge, and thereby exploded
the bole almost as soon as it was lighted 
Tho fuse has been found so uniform and
reliable by experimentation before anil
since the late catastrophe that it is re
garded as improbable that a fuse eight
feet long should be so utterly lacking
in the ordinary characteristics of a
primer as to cause the explosion
No Harm one
 disputed point in electric science
was accidentally settled by the Stand
ard Electric Company this week It
has been contended by the knowing
ones that in the eent of two heay
currents of electricity meeting, an ex
plosion would result; firework on a
large scale, with destructie effects,
would ineitably ensue By an acci
dent to the pipe line at Electra the cur
rent from that plant to the bay cities
was shut off The Bay Counties plant
at Colgate was called upou to supply
the power to tide oer the interim
While the electric current was being
supplied from this source the Electra
plant was put in effectie shape and
the current turned on, so that the
wires at the point of junction were
charged with a powerful oltage from
both plants There was no explosion,
no fuss or trouble whateer The two
currents blended and united as peace
fully as two streams of water, and one
of the delusions of electricians has
thereby been dispelled Thecombiued
currents was estimated at 55,000 olts
This experience has attracted much
attention from experts in electric
science
Had Neer Seen Her Father in Fifty
Years
Mrs Magoon, from Montille, Waldo
county, Maine, is isiting her aunt,
Mrs S W Bright, In Jackson, accom
panied by her married daughter, Mrs
Maguire Mrs Magoon is a daughter
of Lambert Littlefield, formerly of
tnador county, but now liing at
Clements, in San Joacjuin county The
principal object of hor isit frptn the
tlantic to the Pacific coast was to
see her aged father, wbo is now 82
years old Mrs Magoon was born in
1852, and had neer seen her father
until she met him on this isit to Cali <
forma on July 15 of this year Her
father emigrated to California before
she was born, and when Mrs Little
field joined her husband the subject of
this sketch, then an infant of 2 1/2 years,
was left in charge of her grandparents
in Maine, by whom she was raised to
womanhood She was one of twin
daughters, but her sister passed away
in infancy Mrs Magoon isited her
brother, Frank Littlefield, in Oakland
during her present isit, whom she
had neer seen before
One Imprisoned, the other ischarged
Thc bearing pf J Torta, who was
arrested on a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon upon Cbas ickerman
at mador City a couple of weeks ago,
was held before Justice Rose in Sutter
Creek last Saturday The eidence
tended to show that defendant acted
in pelfdefense, and bad reasonable
grounds to rear an assault The judge
concluded that there was not sufficient
eidence to justify holding him for
trial, and he was discharged Cbas,
ickerman, who was charged with
assault upon Torta, committed some
time ago, pleaded guilty tp simple as
sault, and was sentenced to 75 days ip
the county jail, without any alternatie
of fine So ended this case which has
created much discussion in labor circles
throughout the county ickerman
was a picket for the mador union at
the Fremont mine He had made him
self obnoxious to Torta by his zeal in
the union cause, and the assault to
which he pleaded guilty was on this
account Tqrta was pn the eye qf
leaing the county, owing to the an
noyance to which he was subject On
the roadway that eening ickerman
rude up to him, and stopped to dis
mount, when Torta, in fear of bodily
harm, fired twice, shot did
much barm; indeed, it is not certain
whether either shot tpok effect Torta
admitted shooting at ickerman twice,
but the circumstances were held tp
exonerate him from prpsecutipn

would be, and een after defeat stared
them in the face they proed them
seles to be true gamesters, remaining
goodnatured at all times, standing
their defeat like men, and not criticis
ing and slurring the umpire as is too
often the case Manager Sanguinetti
of the El Beys, did the manly act by
calling all the boys In seeral times to
cool their dusty throats with ice water,
etc, so that they could the more lustily
cheer their comrades on to ictory
The grand stand was filled with a jolly
crowd of spectators, that loudly ap
plauded good plays made by either sidu
There was not a kicker in either team,
and the umpire's decisions were heeded
without a murmur The following is

grounds played au interesting game
Sunday
O'Connell of San ndreas made a
pretty onehand catch and got his man
Santirfo caught a pretty foul fly
"Sockey" is too short in the reach
to hit an out cure,
Bring your kodaks and get a picture
of Caagnaro on the run if you want
Grillo sent a threebagger Into right

plate
Pete Casslnelli enjoyed the game
He is a baseball enthusiast when hie

er, and Giannini, the sbortstpp, were
interested spectators
Caagnaro made the only home run
It was the most gracoful run of his life,
Merkel clung to the only center field
fly like a "nigger" to grim death
Question — Is a player wbo strikes at
and is struck by the first ball that
passes after going to the bat out?
Si Nargi, who umpired Sunday's
game, eened things up for both sides
and gae eptjr satisfaction
Some of those pretty suits gut pretty
well dusted by sliding in on bases
Grillo played Ist base for the El Rey a

trouble; in fact the cumbersome engine,
weighing 17 tons, made the turn much

Copyright, 190 by E Warner
When Heibert Bascom's effects were
moed into the Holbein studios the
ther occupants gathered In the front
windows and jeered openly Bascom,
whose hearing was singularly acute,
caught the comments as far up as the
third floor What those on the fourth
lloor thought was scarcely of impor
tance The singular unanimity of
opinion among the dwellers of the three
lower floors argued that those up aboe
would scarcely be moed to comment
approingly in defiance of their fel
lows
The only trouble with Bascom's ef
fects was that they were new — dis
tressingly new From the oilcloth for
the tiny kitchen to the Persian rugs
and Turkish hangings they all came
from first hand stores The Holbein
ites were unaccustdmed to such ex
traagances They had bought second
hand things when they had first set
up and thereby had acquired merit in
the eyes of those already established
It was unbohemian, as Tollier ex
pressed it, to hae glaring new furni
ture and things in one's studio It
argued the possession of unseemly
quantities of money and small artistic
merit From the moment that the first
deliery wagon backed up to the door
Bascom lost his surname, so far as
his fellows were concerned, and gained
the title of the ' ristocrat It was
Tollier's nickname, but it spread rap
idly, and no French communist eer
hated the name more than the Hol
beinites N
s soon as the place had been set
tled Bascom went around one morn
ing deliering initations for a studio
tea that afternoon There were many
moed to accept the initation, for the
deliery wagon of a leading grocery
had unloaded much that looked at
tractie that morning
But Tollier made a personal can
ass, and when Bascom hurried home
that afternoon, laden with additional
packages, he was met by a neat pile
of regrets carefully pinned upon his
door s a result of Tollier's actiity
it had been decided to snub this aris
tocrat who sought by means of the tea
to flaunt his rich possessions before
their eyes It was unbohemian, and,
while his"^)resence had to be tolerated,
friendship and fellowship should be
withheld
Bascom was no fool He readily per
ceied why he was being snubbed and
quietly accepted the situation He
nodded friendlily to the men when he
met them in the halls and graely re
moed his hat when he passed the wo
men For the rest he went to work
and found in this an absorption which
did not permit him to worry about the
attitude of hts neighbors He missed
their companionship, but he had letters
in plenty Since the artistic colony re
fused to recognize him he deoted him
self to his society engagements when
time permitted, thereby bringing forth
additional comment as to the gor
geousness of his garments
Then came Miss lice Caswell She
was but a decorator of china, but her
effects were pitifully  meager, and she
was at once accepted by the rest of the
inhabitants as a bobemian
She was a bright, brisk, een tem
pered girl, and before the week wns
out she had made friends een with
the janitor, a feat hitherto supposed
to be impossible She had the studio
across the hall from Bascom, and be
fore she had learned of his isolation
had already formed a friendship with
him She had, needed some material
which she did not hae time to go out
for, and he had generously supplied her
wants She had noted with approing
eye his skill as a draftsman and fine
sense of color fter that she soon ac
quired the habit of dropping in to ask
his adice about her designs, finding
his wide experience of great alue
By the time the other dwellers in
the studio building had thought to
warn her of the Intruder i their col
ony the intruder had become her men
tor, and she grieed greatly as one
after another the rest of the artists let
slip some caustic fling
"But he is a really cleer man," she
assured Tollier one day as he sat
perched in the window seat declaiming
against the^ ristocrat "I assure you
that his paintings are ery much aboe
the aerage"
Tollier snorted  contemptuously
"My dear child," he remarked pater
nally, "you do some ery cleer china
work on't try to get beyond it and
set up as a critic There neer was a
man who settled here with new
furniture He can't be an artist" Then
the conersation dropped There was
no argning with Tollier when he call
ed one "dear child"
 few weeks later she had a birth
day party Early in the morning the
occupants of the other studios began
to arried each with some little token
and the inariable inquiry as to wheth
er Bascom had been inited to the
eening festiities It seemed odd to
her that they should be so interested
In his possfble appearance, but she
readily answered that he would No
objection being offered, she personally
rounded up Bascom when the time of
the party arried and got him across
the hall on the plea that she needed
help in the preparation of the supper
Bascom had Interposed many objec
tions when she had inited him, bat
Bhe had pleaded with him, and on her
insurance that the attitude of the oth
iteii had materially changed he decided
to risk It because she wanted it
fshe neer realized that the abnte

mcPersonalit of the criticism was because sho
wus openly his champion and the rest
hitl decided to respect her "delusioa"
ac tlif termed it She was so happy
editing the spread ready that she netr
noticed the clock until all of the prep
arations had been made
"Why, It's 9!" she said wonderingly
"I asked them to come In about 8 I'll
take a little run down the hall and re
Qiind some of them"
Bascom sank Into the easy chair in
front cf the cannel coal flre Canne!
coal was a luxury in the Holbein flats,
but he had sent two scuttlefuls that
morning in honor of the eent lice
ran down the hall to Tollier's door
There pinned to a panel was the sign,
"Gone to the theater" She retraced
her steps to the stairway On eery
floor was some card giing notice that
the owner had gone out She de
Bcendtd to the lower floors pparent
ly not a soul remained in the building
Bascom by the fireplace was startled
by the tiny figure that darted in and
sank sobbing upon the homemade cozy
corner
It, took small questioning to get at
the trouble The cause he already
knew The form the opposition had
taken was all he needed to ask
"I wouldn't hae minded so much,"
she sobbed, "only I did so want them
to meet you and see how nice you
really were"
"id you get it all up for me," he
demanded eagerly
She nodded "That Isn't the worst
of It," she confessed "I een inented

away and I couldn't wait I thought
they would be more apt to come to a
birthday party Now I hae all thetr
presents and they wouldn't come"
"He drew the tearful little face down
upon his shoulder "Little girl," he
said gently, "don't you think they
would be more apt to come to a wed
ding?"
"I couldn't inent that," she pro
tested In a muffled oice
"It's ery easy," he preslsted "Just
say 'yes' I will look after the rest I
hae wanted to ask you for a long
time"
Een Tollier came to the wedding
and led the chorus of "He's a Jolly
good fellow" as he poured seeral
quarts or rice down the eleator shaft
after the departing pair James had
discoered that Bascom really had to
work for a liing, and that the studio
had been furnished by a maiden aunt,
who insisted that he be started right'

mountains in the world, rises 17,000
feet aboe the ast flat plain which'
bears its name and reigns oer the sur
rounding mountains Early in the
morning, while all the alleys of ra

buried in shadow, the white top of the
Scriptural mountain gleams beautiful

The rmenian people tell this 6tory
about the Inhabitants of PharbeePersonal
Once the deil and a Pharbee man
laid a wager as to which should first
see the sun The one who saw it first
was to box the other's ears "Very
well," said the rmenian, and he lay
down and slept sweetly, while the
deil, itching to punish his enemy,
stood looking eastward, and with eager
eyes watched the whole night for the
sunrise Early in the morning the
Pharbee man rose and pointing to the
top of the rarat, which was already
shining in the 6un, cried Joyfully, "I
'see It!" The deil was anquished
The Pharbee man, with his strong
hand, boxed the deil's ears Eer
since that time the deil has been

Her Reward
"The brute!" exclaimed the bride of
a year
"Hae a cup of tea, dear," said her
fondest friend, "and tell me all about
it What has he been doing now?"
"You know I told you he has been
encouraging me In learning to cook,
has praised my nice little entrees, takea
me to the theater as an occasional re
ward and all that"
i "No good ground for a separation In
that, I imagine," said the dearest
friend, with slight sarcasm
"Your sympathy Is worse than your
tea," retorted the bride, who was ob
iously out of sorts "But I'm going
to tell you anyway Not long ago he
promised me a surprise if I would turn
out a nice dinner cooked all by my
self, from soup to coffee Last night
I did so Eerything pleased him
" 'My pet,' he remarked, 'I beliee
I promised you a surprise on an occa

" 'Yes, darling,' I answered 'Oh, do
tell me what it is?'

Right Hand and Left
"There are few people who are not,
in one respect or another, left handed,
if only in the management of a coffee
cup," said a writer "I, for instance,
always deal cards with my left hand,
though I am left handed in no other
discoerable manner There is a well
known artist in Philadelphia, too, whe
draws with his left hand, but who
writes with his right
"If the crucial test of supremacy Ie
demanded and right and left hands
come to the final court of appeal It will
be found in the wielding of so simple
a thing as a pair of scissors The fal
low who is really right handed can anil
may do many things "with his left lie
may instinctiely use his left Jiand for
his glass and ply his fork from the
Biime side But he canuot succeed i
cutting the nails of the fingers of nil
right hand with scissors There in
something in a little pair of nail scis
sors which tries the human hand to Its
utmost capacity"— Philadelphia Press

la a paper read before the congress
of French alienists at Grenoble r
Gaston Lalanne pointed out that
anxiety is a disturbance which is ex
pressed by the entire being The ex
citing causes are  sometimes physical
and sometimes psychical, and the
symptoms manifested are both phys
iral and mental The physical symp
toms comprise cold feelings and chills
of the Pcnlp and body, general lassi

moements far more apparent than
real emotional coloring of speech, and
ertigo, which is^ dependent upon aso

digestie troubles • In the anxious
states there  are always circulatory
troubles, such as accelerated heart beat
Irregularity of" the heart's action,
heightened arterial tension and cold
ness of the extremities Respiratory
disturbances are also present
The psychical symptoms of anxiety
include arious degrees of Vague dread
and apprehensieness, • often taking
definite forms, in which case they are
designated as "phobias" or "obessions
of fear," weakening the capacity of at

He Wai tie Original ot Sam TVeller
 of Pickwick Fame
• The original of Sam Weller was Bam
Vale, an English low comedian, who,
In the early part of the last century, was
quite popular in the south of England
In the year 1811, and for a few years
after, he made quite a reputation In the
musical farce called "The Boarding
House," written by Beasley In this
he played the part of Simon Spatter
dash, a person who indulged In odd and
whimsical sayings "Come on, as the
old man said to the tight boot;" "I am
down on you,' aa the extinguisher said
to the candle;" "Let eery one take
care of himself, as the donkey said
when  dancing among tbe chickens,"
are fair illustrations of his witticisms
In the course of that play, the resem
blance between them and some of the
sayings of Sam Weller being ery
marked In priate life Vale was a
wit, and many good things In his own
time were credited to him   man of
excellent temper, he had no enemies,
and the good humor which peraded
eery saying, together with the droll
ery of his manner, gae his witticisms
unusual alue His sayings were called
Sam Valerisms, and on the appearance
of Pickwick In 1836 the character of
Weller^was generally recognized as a
portraiture of VaJe The comedian died

When the south sea bubble in Eng

went to Smyrna to repair his fortune
He was a friend of lexander Pope
and sent him a box of figs in which
had been placed a twig of a tree Pope
planted the twig on his grounds on the
shore of the Thames, not knowing of
what tree it was It grew and was a
weeping willow In 1775, when the
tree was oer fifty years old, one of
the young British officers who came to
Boston with the British army brought
a twig from the tree, which he intend
ed to plant on his lands after tbe re
bellion had been crushed John Parke
Custlsson of Mrs Washington, going
on errands to the British camp under
a flag of truce, became acquainted
with the owner of the willow twig,
which was draped in oiled silk, and ob

near his home at, bingdon, Va, where
It became the progenitor of all (he

Naturalists hae duly recorded that
that if a sea anemone be diided In
hales longitudinally a new animal will
in time be reproduced by each half, as
suming tbe anemone is kept in pure sea
water n old zoologist relates how he
watched an anemone which somehow
or other had contried to half swallow
one of the ales of an oyster shell
Practically the shell struck in its gir
eard and gradually cut its way down
through the soft tissues of the anem
oneuntil It haled the animal as by
a partition Perfect reproduction of
two anemones through the diision of
one was noted to be the result of this
accident Een a fragment or two of
an anemone body left attached to its
rock may In due season reproduce a
