The Calaeras Prospec akes issue wih he Ledger in is
posiion in regard o Haas, he wonldbeslayer of Francis J
Heney Our coemporary endeaors o make ou ha he
Ledger's aricle excused in some'degree he commission of
ha crime I was inended for  nohing of he kind Is
purpose was o show ha he mehods in criminal procedure,
, as praciced in our cours, areunfair, inhnman, and end o
work up indiiduals who are subjeced o he ordeal of bad
gering aorneys o he fighing poin Probably in no
oher counry in he ciilized world would such wanon hu
miliaion of winesses be oleraed nd i ough no o be
oleraed here The sooner reformaion of such mehods is
made he beer for he digniy of he sae and he proecion
of sociey
Furhermore, we ake excepion o he charge, sared by
he papers in San Francisco and reieraed by our Calaeras
coemporary, ha Haas was hired o ge on he Ruef jury
and promised $000 o bring abou a misrial I may be ail
rue, bu no a scinilla of proof has been produced o suppor
i Indeed he circumsances go o show ha his slander of he
dead has been roed ou o exenuae or jusify he raking
up of Haas' prison record of weny years ago If he prose
cuion knew of such dicker wih Ruef or his agen, why did
hey no raise he poin in order o hae him excused as a
juror Surely i would hae been a legal ground for excuse
Bu no effor was made in his direcion, which indicaes ha
no such knowledge was in he possession of he prosecuing
aorneys I was simply an aferhough o bolser up he
brual parade of he one under examinaion in conic garb
I is on a par wih ha oher scandalous saemen ha Mrs
Haas coneyed o her husband when in jail he pisol wih
which he ook his own life s if he widow in her sable
robes had no enough of sorrow wihou his monsrous
charge being laid a her door This was hurled a her in or
der ha he negligen officials migh be shielded from blame
The Ledger has 110 sympahy wih criminals or criminal
mehods Bu he spiri of our ciilizaon is o gie hose who
hae made a missep an opporuniy o redeem hemseles
fer hey hae expiaed heir offense by suffering he penaly
imposed by he cour ha should be he end of he maer as
far as he sae is concerned To hound a man aferwards, as
was done in, he Haas case is persecuion, and no pros
ecuion '
I The filling of he superior judgeship has already called
forh wo almos diamerically opposie opinions from quasi
public bodies in mador couny The conclusions reached —
or raher he conflic of opinions — mus end o perplex he
goernor, who has he appoining power, in regard o his
ery imporan maer The republican commiee has me,
and failed o recommend any aspiran from mador couny
They know or a leas hae eery reason o beliee, ha Go

 French wrier, olling of ho llfo
of ho lighhouse keepers along ho
cons of Irilnny, hinks i srange
hn any of hem escape Insaniy
The sysem of relief ha preails in
his counry has no equialen in he
French serice, and, wih shor lner
nlw, monhs apar, a French ligh
house keeper may spend fory years of
his life ending he lamps in ono sa
ion, wh a Rlnglc companion, nnd ha
saion may bo on a rock ou in ho
channel or he bay of Blscny, •which
boas can approach only in lino
weaher
s a maer of fac, he men ofen
do become insane or a leas deelop
monomania Someimes I akes he
form of hared of each oher
In one case, a Terennec, one of wo
men was found by a pary who came
off from he shore In response o sig
nals lying dead in his bod wih a loug
keen bladed knife hrough his hear
Ills companion's sory was ha lie
had commlcHl suicide afer a long
period of melancholia There was no
proof o he conrary, bu afer exam
ining ho wound he auhoriies doub
ed he ruh of ho sory
On anoher occasion, where faher
nnd son ended an isolaed beacon o
geher, be young man was seized wih
nn aack of uouo mania When ho
ime came o ligh up bo planed him
self in fron of he sairway o ho lan
ern and refused o allow his faher o
ascend
The old man aacked his son and,
finding he could subdue him in no
oher way, so ha he lighs on which
bo many lies depended migh be kin
dled, srangled him o deah The nex
day lie signaled o ho shore for help
nnd gae himself up o he police, ell
ing wha lie had done
Sickness and deah are no srangers
In he lighhouses There is uiney
nine imes ou of a hundred no ckance
of medical a,id, and he well man pre
scribes from he medicine ches for
he sick ono as lies he can He also
doe? double duy unil his parner re
coers or relief comes
There nre no infrequen cases when
he surior has o sow up his dead
comrade in a hammock and launch Ills
weighed body from he rocks Ino ho
Bea Then come long nighs of lonely
waching •
In winer ime he lamps mus be
ended and he clockwork kep going
for foureen o lifeen hours The lan
ern is unheaied excep for he glow
of be lamps up In is ceiling, and he
goernmen allows he wacher jo
chair les ho fall asleep
I is no wonder ha wsiif fancies
come o he men They hear' oices
calling from ho sea and see drowned,
men and women looking up a hera
from he breakers One of heir hor
rors is of he birds ha bea agains
he windows of ho lanern a nigh,
araced by he glare
Jus as is he case wih merican ligh
houses, he feahered armies ha mi
grae a nigh bea agains he walls
and balconies of he beacons wih heir
wings and dash agains he panes of
ho lanern, someimes breaking ho
glass wih heir beaks s heir eyes
shine in he glare hey seem o express
anger or bloodhirsiness o he men
wihin
One of he mos piiful sories of
lighhouse life Is old of ho keeper a
Four en Fiuiserre, who kep all alone
a saion on an isolaed rock a couple
of mllos ou from ho shore, bu so
surf beaen ha only once a monh
or so was a boa sen ou o i wih
supplies
Tbe cabin in which he keeper made
his home was on he shore opposie his
lighhouse, nnd ho recreaion be mos
enjoyed was waching i hrough his
elescope lie could see he people go
in and ou and he children playing in
fron of i
One day be saw somehing fluering
from he door jamb, lie was puzzled
Then i flashed ou him ha i was
crape and ha some ono had died in
ho house
Was I his moher, ho wondered, or
his wife or one of bis brohers? He
couned ho children laer in he duy,
and hey were all righ
The wind blew, and he waer raged
No boa could come near him, and ho
wached ho crowd of sympahizing
friends come and go Then ho saw he
funeral
Ho recognized he cure a he head
of ho procession by his whie surplice
and he ular boys walking beside him
Then eamo ho coffin, carried by six
men

life by acciden, or sncidc The circumsances surrounding
he maer poin srongly o sucide He was being hounded
by a clique on accoun of his managemen of he Haas maer,
and charges were pending agains him I is belieed ha
he srain was oo much or him o bear, nd he resored o
suicide as he oule I is no claimed ha here was any,
hing of a disgraceful characer aaching o his conduc of
he office He simply fell under he band of he dicaorial
clique, and hey clamored for his remoal Of course he
showed weakness in aking he suicide roue, He should
hae faced he music like a man Bu some men are so con
siued ha deah is prefferred o een an inesigaion ha
would gie pain o friends, and his seems o hae been he
makeup of Biggy He was wihou quesion a conscienious

no open o objecion from any source Shonld, howeer, he

officer, and one of the best heads of the police department that
San Francisco has had for many years. He fell a victim to
the attacts of venomous newspapers.
The declination of the republican county central committee
to indorse any applicant of the judgeship is explainable and
the theory that there were possible canidates on the outside,
known to Governor Gillett, but unknown to the committee,
who by experience and loug practice in the legal profession,
might be better qualified for the office, than applicants within
the limits of Amdaor County. It must not be taken as a re
flection upon the legal profession here, but only indicates a
desire to get the best qualified man available for that high
and responsible office. This spirit is commendable, and is
not open to objection from any source. Shonld, however, the
contest for this position be narrowed down to applicants who
are well-known to the people of Amador Count}' by former or
present residents and of whose fitness for the place the people
here are probably better able to judge than those on the out
side, then it ought to be in order to cast aside all reserve, and
indorse the one who is considered best qualified. It is re
ported that the governor would make the appointment within
the next few clays. This would convey the idea that the va
cancy would be filledfrom the applications on file, all of whom
are well known. In such event, the republicans should lose
no time in getting their views and wishes before the governor,
who may be depended upon to meet the desires of the major
ity of the republican votes.
Clean Food
It Is a good deal more important that
food shall not carry the germs of dis
ease than that It shall be chemically
pure. Table salt, for example, may
contain some soda salts other than the
chloride and still be perfectly health
ful. Corn bread is less healthful when
made from pure cornmeal than when it
has some admixture of wheat flour.
But food that is not clean may be
more dangerous than any adulterated
food product sold today, provided the
adulterated article carries no disease
germs. — Boston Advertiser.
Sympathy
A «kind hearted little slum girl on a
visit to the country saw one evening
a mother hen about to gather her
brood of chicks under her wings. The
little girl rushed up to the hen and
shouted:
"Shoo, you ugly thing! How dare
you sit down on these beautiful little
birds?"
Vicarious Osculation
He was having some words with her
chaperon.
"I'll— I'll kiss her right under your
nose!" he said, defiantly.
"Oh, well," said that lady, "vica
rious kissing like that I can see no
objection to."— Boston Transcript.

The Word "Ogre."
Old fashioned etymologists used to
say that the word "ogre" commemorat
ed the sufferings of Europe during the
ninth and tenth centuries at the hands
of the ravaging "Olgours," or Huns.
This derivation, however. Is now aban
doned. "Ogre," which reached the
French language by way of Italian and
Spanish, Is really Orcus, the Latin hell,
afterward the god of the underworld.
In Romanesque folklore this god be
came a shaggy, black, man devouring
monster, with a particular taste for
lost babes In the wood.
A Gift to an Explorer
"Peary." said a geographer of CM
cago, "never stiirtod on one of bis
exploring expeditions without receiv
ing hy mail and express all sorts of
packages from cranks — cowhide under
wear, tea tablets, medicated boots and
whnt not.
"I'eary j»ee told uie that (leorgi-
Ade, a few dhys before the start of his
last trip, wired him to expect an im
portant package by express.
'"The package came. It was labeled:
" 'To be opened at the farthest point
north.
"Penry opened It at ouee. however
It was a small keg Inscribed:
" •Axle Brew for tiu> pole.' "
It Quiets
the Cough
This is one reason why Ayer's
Cherry Pectoral is so valua-
ble in consumption. It stops
the wear and tear of useless
coughing. But it does more
— it controls the inflammation,
quiets the fever, soothes, heals.
Ask your doctor about this.
