which he named Barholomew and Bel
adine; wo of a medium size, called
Turkeulium and Beriue; wo small
ones, denominaed Pega and Bega He
also caused he grea bell o be made
called Gudla, which was uned o he

The bells used in he monaseries
were someimes rung wih ropes ha

by hose incapable of oher duies, as

was a remarkably handsome man, and
his wife was one of his sinceres ad

"William, wha do you hink made

he soldier The oher, howeer,
hough near a foo shorer, was a man

as much by his own mad rush as by

In my judgmen, ofen a iling ha

CAUSED PACKERS' PLIGHT.
Interview with Author of the Now
Famous "Jungle "—Expose of Meat
Packing Methods.
Upton Sinclair, the author of the
"Jungle" which has in reality started
the entire packing house scandal, is an
advocate of municipal slaughter
bouses. He believes that this is the
only effective solution of the problem,
although he says tha^ the Beveridge
amendment is good so far as it goes.
Interviewed recently, he said, "There
ia no doubt that this amendment will
become a law; but a few months
after its enactment it will be forgotten
and former conditions will be resumed.
I say former conditions, because the
Chicago packers have cleaned up
house and are now able to make a
show of virtue which they never pos
sessed, but it is impossible for them
to conceal the fact thai : >ey have sent
out millions of cans of 'potted chicken'
made of bob, or day-old veal, millions
of cans of roast beef made of cow
udders and gristle, and that all this
vast output has been treated with
chemicals to conceal putrefaction
and to preserve the stuff sold under a
false name.
GOVERNMENT SLAUGHTER
HOUSES IN EUROPE.
"Every slaughter house in England,
Germany, and Belgium is owned by
the government There is no chance
to graft, because the slaughter of cat
tle and the sale of meat is distinct and
separate. The government kills for
anybody, and charges so much a head.
Twelve samples are cut from each
animal and subjected to a microscopic
examination. If the meat is unhealth
ful It is condemned and destroyed.
The slaughter houses are as cleanly as
modern hospitals, and not to be com
pared in any way with the filthy
shambles we entiure here.
ANSWERING A HOWL.
"As an additional precaution against
graft, it Is provided that the loss in
cident to condemnation shall fall on
the breeder or seller of the cattle and
not to the buyer. This compels the
cattle breeder to care for his stock
in a scientific and sanitary manner.
That answers the violent protests of
the Western cattlemen, who were
forced by the beef trust to inundate
President Roosevelt with telegrams of
objection to the Beveridge bill, until
it was discovered that the making pub
lic of the Reynolds-Neill report would
work more damage to the business of
canning dyed bob veal and selling it
as chicken.
"The opposition to the bill was not
because the packers feared it would
interfere with their fraudulent prac
tices, but because it would impose up
on them a tax of $2,000,000 a year, to
pay for the inspection, which is noth
ing more or less than advertisement
for their bogus goods in foreign
countries.
MR. SINCLAIR'S SOLUTION.
"Every city in ( the United States
should have municipal slaughter
houses. All private slaughter houses
should be abolished. The result of
such a condition would be to break
the power of the packers' trust. They
would have to sell out at cost the
slaughter houses fit for the killing of
food animals, and destroy those that
are unfit. That is the only solution of
the problem, which is now recognized
as of huge importance to the people
of this country, and the only way that
public opinion can be enlightened is
to permit the commissioners appointed
by President Roosevelt to make pub
lic the full story of the horrors they
found in the head center of the great
depot of reception and distribution in
Chicago.
"The packers know that their very
life depends upon the approval of
foreign nations, and they know that
the stamp of governmental approval
abroad is regarded as the hall mark
of excellence. They know that the
millions in Europe understand official
indorsement to be an absolute and
unassailable guarantee and they re
gard official indorsement by agents of
the United States government in the
same light and with the same con
fidence."
POINTS OF BEVERIDSE MEAT
INSPECTION BILL.
Provides for rigid postmortem In
spection of all cattle, swine, sheep,
and goats killed for human consump
tion. All meats found healthful shall
be tagged, and all meat found un
healthful shall be destroyed.
All slaughterers anC packers and
all others engaged in preparation of
meat products must admit inspectors
to all parts of their establishments.
All canning, rendering, salting, and
packing products are included, and
any products treated with dyes or
deleterious chemicals or presevatives
shall be condemned.
All establishments must be main
tained in a sanitary manner, accord
ing to rules and regulations prescribed
by the Secretary of Agriculture.
After January 1, 1907, no railroad or
any other common carrier can trans
port any meat product not inspected
or passed, and no ship with such
articles on board shall be given clear
ance papers, nor can any common
carrier transport any meat product
that is prepared in an establishment
where specified sanitary conditions do
not prevail.
All canned, potted, or canvased
meat products shall be labeled as in
spected and passed and shall not be
offered for sale until so labeled.
Signals on Rural Mail-Boxes.
The Fourth Assistant Postmaster
General has issueu an order providing
that after July 1 next, rural delivery
carriers, when making their trips, will
visit and examine only those boxes for
which they have mail for delivery and
those on which the signals are dis
played to indicate that there is mail
for dispatch.
Those patrons who are now main
taining mail boxes on which there are
no signals will be required to procure
some sort of device which will serve
as a signal to carriers.
By this new arrangement it is ex
pected that the delivery and collection
of mail along rural free delivery
routes will be greatly facilitated.
In the Bank of England there are
ingots of silver that have been there
since the seventeeth century.

WHY DOES PAINT PEEL OFF
— o
Some will tell you there is no good paint any
more. Others that there are no good painters. Both
statements are incorrect. The trouble is, years ago
you could scarcely go wrong in painting, for there was
little paint used but pure white lead and oil. Nowadays
there are almost as many alleged "paints" as there
are rival dealers to sell them, and as many so-called
white leads which are not white lead, as there are pro-
prietary paints.
Yet good white lead and linseed oil paint is as
good as it ever was— and better. If you are in real
earnest about getting paint which will look well and
last— the good old kind of other days — let us tell you
about our pure white lead.
