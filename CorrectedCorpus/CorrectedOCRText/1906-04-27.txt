Copyrigh, 1905, by E C Parceils
John Pearson was disincly annoyed,
lie would no hae belieed Eugenia
could be so unreasonable I was bad
enough o lose Haens, who was he
bes senographer he eer had, bu
when he finally secured anoher who
could do saisfacory work, o hae Eu
genia objec because he girl was
young and prey was enough o make
a man lose all paience
lie sroe o appease his fiancee's
wrah by poining ou how inferior in
beauy and grace he new senographer
appeared o him in comparison wih
herself He ried o appeal o her rea
son, her pride, for faih In him, bu o
lile purpose
"You need no rouble o call again
or o communicae wih me unil you
hae discharged ha girl," was he
ulimaum, and Fearsau wen away,
angry and indignan, anahemaizing
all women and heir silly, unreasonable
jealousy
Miss nhony was no ofen unrea
sonable and had had lile occasion for
jealousy She hardly could hae ' ex
plained i herself, bu her annoyance
abou he girl and her resenmen o
ward her loer had begun when she
had asked he name of he new em
ployee and ' John had replied, "nna
arling" j
The iny flames had been fanned and
increased by eery word of praise for
Miss arling ha he unconscious
Pearson had supidly uered unil she
could bear i no ljuger She magnified
his saisfacion wih he girl's work
ino loe for he girl herself, and she
fel for he momen quie jusified in
demanding her discharge
Bu wih he nex day's ligh Miss
nhony's good sense and loe of fail
play reassered iself "How silly I
was," she hough
She resoled o send him a lile noe
or a elephone message, bu decided o
wai unil eening He was o ake her
o he opera, and on he way she would
confess her unreasonableness
The eening passed, and no John ami
no message o explain his absence Ten
o'clock, 10Personal30! "I won' be foolish," shj
hough firmly I'll call him up by
phone and ell him I wan o say good
nigh"
She had ofen done his when i had
no been possible for John o come o
her She smiled happily as she rang he
bell and called for he Pearson resi
dence John lied wih his broher, and
she knew he family had gone away
She recognized he housekeeper's oice
in reply o her call, bu her face fell a
he message Mr John had no been
home, and Mrs Barnes could ge no re
ply o frequen calls oer he phone o
he office
The nex morning Miss nhony
called Mrs Barnes again, wih similar
resuls Mr John did no come home,
and here was eidenly no one a his
oflice
Miss nhony was essenially a wo
man of acion She dressed herself in a
mos becoming sree cosume and a
half hour laer was enering he grea
office building on Congress sree Pear
son's office was closed, he door locked
"He wasn' here all day yeserday,"
oluneered he eleaor boy
"Bu surely some one was," insised
Miss nhony "The young lady" —
"She came in he morning, bu wen
away again immediaely," he answered
Miss nhony was quick o resole
and equally quick o execue She con
suled he direcory and ook a car for
rlingon  he door of a nea lile
coage she paused Yes, here was he
name arling, on he doorplae Wha
could she say o he girl een if she
found her? id she really expec o be
liee ha she and John — Then she lif
ed her head proudly Was she going o
be silly again? Somehing had happen
ed o John, and Miss arling migh be
able o aid her in learning wha i was
When Miss arling enered he room
Miss nhony hardly could resrain he
impulse o ake her in her arms, such
a prey, imid looking lile hing—
hardly more han a child  Her eyes
were isibly red wih weeping, and
when Miss nhony asked her if she
had been a work he day before her
face colored painfully
Miss nhony explained enough of
he siuaion for Miss arling o un
dersand he reason for her isi, and
hen Miss arling old her own sory
hurriedly
"I hae been wih Mr Pearson nearly
a monh and supposed my work was
enirely saisfacory I wen o work
yeserday morning as usual, bu I had
hardly enered he office when he ele
phone bell rang On answering i I
found i was Mr Pearson speaking He
said ha he should require my serices
no longer and would mail me a check
for wo monhs' salary"
She paused, choking back 2 sob Miss
nhony blushed wih shame and re
gre
"I lef Ihe office immediaely, of
course I canno undersand i, for I
was a work on some papers ha Mr
Pearson was ery anxious o hae fin
ished his week— work ha anoher
senographer could no well ake up
nd" — she hesiaed — "as ye I hae
no receied he check"
Miss nhony spoke rapidly and wih
decision "Miss arling, I am con
inced ha here is some misake I
know Mr Pearson was saisfied wih
your work"
"o you hink," asked Miss arling
eagerly, "ha i was no Mr Pearson—
ha i was a hoax?"
"I hardly know wha o hink," re
nnieO Miss nhony easiely, "bu I
am so sure ha Mr Pearson is leaseil
wih your work and wishes o reain
you in his employ ha I am going o
ask you o reurn o he office now
wih me Perhaps in some way wa
may learn somehing of him"
The wo girls were sanding before
Pearson's door, and Miss arling was
searching in her handbag for her dupli
cae key when a young man approach
ed, saying coureously, "Were you look
ing for Mr Pearson?"
"Yes," answered Miss nhony quie
ly "Can you ell me if he will be in
oday?"
"I hink no There are seeral im

Miss nhony recognized her inform
an as a> young archiec who had an
oflice In he same building
"I ^db\no''; undersand," she said
"Wha has Mr Pearson go o do wih
he grand jury ?"
"Mr Pearson was seized yeserday
by Unied Saes Marshal Brown o
sere" s Miss nhony's face beok
ened no enlighenmen, he" wen onPersonal
"When he grand jury was polled yes
erday herejrere hree absenees, and
in order o carry on he business i waa
necessary o fill hose acancies Tha
absen men are sick, and i would
grealy reard he work of he goern
men if he jury had o be adjourned
unil hey recoered"
Miss nhony regained her poise
"Would Mr Pearson hae o go If he
did no wish?" in saely surprise
"Yes ny ciizen is liable o such
draf"
"Bu— bu his own business?" Iner
posed Miss arling
! "Quie a secondary maer in he eyes
of ho law," replied he young man
"nd in such a case is no message
sen o he ciizen's friends?" ques
ioned Miss nhony
"Cerainly If Mr Pearson had any
clerk or secreary in his office he dep
uy marshal would likely noify ha
person, and Mr Pearson could send s
message o his family If he has one"
Miss nhony and Miss arling ex
changed glances They knew ha Mr
Pearson had no family and a he ime
of his unwelcome seizure he had no
clerk, and Miss nhony knew why nc
message had been sen o her
"nd Mr Pearson canno come away
He is— he is held here?"
"Held by he goernmen," he replied
smilingly
Miss nhony hanked him coureous
ly, and he passed on
Miss arling unlocked he door, and
he wo girls enered he office
"Is he work Mr Pearson waned
done all senographic work?" Miss n
hony asked
"No all There are some absracs o
be copied and"—
"I shall help you," wih genle deci

When he grand jury adjourned Uni

noe o Juryman Pearson
 "Miss arling and I hae your work

he has se i down a he reques of

any counry would be good for him
which furnishes an opporuniy for
empirebuilding, and ha he' would
languish in he bes climae if here

ino  a hard brick subsance More
oer, he Souhern cale feer was a '

He discoered he germ which car

To ouble he Coon Crop
His effor has been o find a hybrid
plan, beween he long saple which
is raised successfully only on he
coas and he less aluable upland
ooon, which can be profiably pro
duced in Middle Georgia By paien
experimenaion, in cooperaion wih

made yea progress In his direcion
and is gradually eoling a coon

ha he Norh has no sen many
men down Souh who hae accom
plished as much in raising he eco
nomic sandard as Benjamin \V Hun
has done, Personal s none he less rue ha
Souhern ciies and owns, and par
icularly lana, are full of Norhern
men who are injecing a new spiri
ino he life of he region nd i
is asly crediable o he naie sock
ha hey welcome enerprising men
from norh of Mason and ixon's
Line and glory in heir achieemens
If hey are less proud of he new
comer han of he oldimer hey cer
ainly conceal he fac The ruh
seems o be ha he whole communiy
is permeaed by he spiri of ener
prise which hese Norhern men hae
brough, and I seems o be refleced
in he buildings, he sores, he ho
els, and in he faces and bearing of
he people hemseles
The populaion of lana and is
immediae suburbs is now probably
abou 150,000 and is rapidly growing,
— a leas wice as rapidly as he pop
ulaion of he Unied Saes Bu is
business, as eidenced by bank clear
ings and posal receips, is growing
much faser han is populaion
This business is largely in he form
of manufacuring, alhough he whole
sale rade IS also expanding o enor
mous proporions The growh of
railway, elegraph and elephone sys
ems naurally keeps pace wih rade,
manufacure and populaion ll his
requires consan aciiy in building
operaions and he employmen of an
increasing army of labor In oher
words, lana, and he grea Sae
of Georgia of which s he merop
olis, are enjoying an era of exraor
dinary prosperiy i
I Science Supplans Chance
This prosperiy is due in large par
o he exen and alue of naural re
sources, bu s also largely due o
he new mehods which hae been in
roduced in recen years Beginning
wih he fanner and going on hrough
fhe line of indusrial facors men are
working in he ligh of science in
sead of depending on chance Wha
Mr Hun has done in connecion wih
lie sock, coon culure and frui
growing, eerybody is doing o some
exen They are geing he aid or
Sae and Naional Goernmens, and
hus assering heir conrol oer he
forces of naure in a way which ap
proaches eer nearer o perfecion
iThis means less 'wase, more fficiency
and a beer disposiion of he com
fors of life
I would be ungracious o say ha
all his is due o he influence of men
from he Norh, and i would be un
rue as well as ungracious; bu I is
neerheless a fac ha he ideas
which dominaed in he old days
were no adaped o he bes use of
Souhern resources and opporuniies
for deelopmen, and ha hese old
ideas had o surrender o new and
beer plans and mehods before he
Souh which is now rapidly deelop
ing could be possible One of he
sronges forces in he new moemen
is he sream of Norhern blood and
capial which has flowed ino he
beauiful Souhern land since he
days of reconsrucion nd I repea,
because i canno be said wih oo
much emphasis, ha Georgia knows
his, appreciaes i, and wans more of
i Personal•,;
These are facs which may be prop
erly aken ino consideraion by Norh
ern people who are looking for homes
They are quie as imporan as soil,
climae and markes In his connec
ion, I am emped o make a final
quoaion from Mr Hun,; because i
has an imporan bearing upon he
social life of he region and is dis
incly in line wih my own obsera
ion Personal
"The case insinc is always resi
den in he brain of he whie man,
Norh or Souh, be he Caholic,Pro
esan or Quaker In he Norh, his
finds expression in social disincion
based on he possession of wealh and

ing he gas bag There I hung, grip
pine for my ery life wih boh hands;
and as I looked down I saw Marini
whirling oer and oer in mid air, and
h» body of poor dead Rechere falling
lik a plumme  Then he single sup
por gae way and he baske wen
down afer hem
I closed my eyes, sick wih horror
ana fain from my remendous muscu
lar effors s in a dream I was con
eeious of swir fligh hrough he air
rrh» rounds of shooing became fainer
££ c ? hl?h I ? he balloon  reed of is
'jreigh of passengers, apparaus, and
n a 2^ Wa s r ,'sing rapidly ino he up
=fi /' l nen r would escape, afer
all I ried o collec my houghs
Knowing ha should I lose conscious
ness my grip would weaken
Suddenly I fel ha I had enered a
Sraum of cold air I was swee and
pure I simulaed me, I opened my
eyes, and glanced below me Earh
liquid no be seen I was In he clouds
W Remember, now, ha I hung by he
grip of wo hands, from a coarse ne
made or halfinch rope forming a caa
IJ IB o he balloon I knew ha I
sQpuld soon be comnplled o res or I
mus le go and follow my lae com
panions Summoning all my nere, I
hrew up one leg, and as luck would
hae i, caugh my foo in a mesh of
he ne I pushed my leg hrough, un
il he rope was under my knee; hen
resed for a few swee minues hang
Ing here like a crab, one log swing
ing free Presenly I secured a similar
hold wih he oher foo; hen working
slowly and carefully, managed o ge
boh arms ino he meshes, and for a
blessed ineral was relieed of seere
srain, hough my hold was by no
means secure
The balloon seemed now o be mo
ing swifly in he wind, bu neiher
rising nor falling The seady gliding
moion, he absolue quie, and he
weariness of body resuling from my
igh grip of he ne, produced a en
dency e sleep I was compelled o
alk o myself o keep awake, and
finding ha een his would no suffice
I deermined o make myself secure
 Imminen risk, for I was geing
woefully cramped, I le go wih my
righ hand, and reaching n my pocke
go my knife, opening i wih my eeh
I cu hrough half a dozen meshes of
he ne and hus made a hole large
enough o admi my head arid shoul
ders, pushing away he eneloping
Tolas of he somewha flabby balloon
By degrees I worked my whole body
hrough, and finally, wih a prayer of
hanks o God found myself lying fla
upon he srong ne wurk, my back
agains he gasbag So grea was he
relief of his posiion ha I sank lmo
Insan Bleep
I seemed an age laer when I awoke,
hearing my name spoken by he oice
of a woman I opened mj eyes aud I
looked around me I lay in a bad
surrounded by silken drapery My
whole body ached, and my head seem I
ed o be seeral imes is ordinary size
Then a oice — ha of he woman —
spoke again, In sof, rippling French
"Monsieur mus be quie I is bes
Monsieur is safe and will soon be well
again"
I looked in he direcion of he sound
and saw approaching m wha I
hough o be he mos beauiful wo
man I had eer seen Fair and all, of
he old French ype, she seemed a er
iable angel Upon her head sne wore
a whie lace cap, which sered only
parially o resrain her brown curls
Her dress was simple — of whie, wih
a ouch of blue a hroa and shoulders
She came o he bedside and leaned
oer me I shall remember o my dy
ing day her sof, cool hands pressed
upon my aching brow Her loose slee
es showed her fair, plump arms nigh
o he elbows, and I recall, een now,
he desire, as I fell asleep, ha I could
hae hose arms abou my neck
I awoke again, some ime laer, feel
ing much refreshed My fair nurse
brough me a glass of cool milk, and
held my hear! In he hollow of her arm
as I drank, smiling and nodding a me
Then I lay quie for a while, and
presenly found myself able o speak
"Where am I?" was my firs ques
ion
She old me ha I was In he Cha
eau Lagunay, on he wes bank of he
Meuse Rier, some disance norhwes
of Verdun In he preies French
which I could readily undersand
hough my own pronounciaion was
execrable, she old me how a dawn
my balloon had come crashing ino
a groe of rees near he Chaeau; how
he gardeners had released me from
my prison in he ne; and how I had
been brough ino he house, by her
faher's insrucions, and cared for
hrough he nigh I was seriously
bruised abou he head and shoulders,
and hey hough a firs ha I was
dead Laer her faher, a French
nobleman of he old regime, came o
he bedside, expressed his pleasure
ha "Monsieur ddams" (hey had
learned my name from papers found in
my pockes) had recoered, assuring
me ha I need hae no concern as o
my perfec welcome o remain as his
gues unil I should be compleely re
sored o healh
I suppose i was he shock ha blo
ed ou, for he nex few days, all
recollecion of my ideniy, or my re
cen experiencp I knew simply ha I
was in Paradise, wih his adorable
angel always a hand o miniser o
hunger or hirs, and o alk sofly o
me a inerals beween naps She
ola me much abou herself She was
bu weny, an only child, wih no
moher ha she could remember She
a»d her faher, and he faihful ser
ans, lied alon Slie seemed ery
happy nd 1f she was happy, wha

My clohes were orn o shreds In he

compelled o accep he coun's offer
of a complee oufi from his own
wardrobe Behold me, herefore, sea
ed in an easy chair, clad in a handsome
sui of plumcolored ele, wih shor
breeches, whie silk sockings, siler
buckled shoes, and a longailed coa,
wha wih lace and ruffles and all he
rimmings of royaly, I fel like a
russed goose; bu imee regarded me

and grace This I had from her own

said The serious look upon my face
sarled him We passed ino he

acquained him wih he eens of

mans Liing, as he did, in such com
plee isolaion, wihdrawn from he
aciiy of he world abou him since
he days of he Second Empire, he had
heard only rumors, and was quie un
aware of he approaching crisis Bu
he rose o he occasion, showing een
in hese declining years unusual power
of decision and acion
Eens moed swifly hen The
Coun summoned his serans and re
ainers and secreed in ha wood 3
nearby a large amoun of siler plae,
coin in chess, and aluable heir
looms imoe "was in grea disress
bu I quieed her wih assurances ha
I would proec her, hough how I
would sand off a German army 1
had no idea Early in he eening
came news of he approach of Lanc

connoiering for he engineers; and
shorly aferward, a French officer
rode up o apprise he Coun, wih

I became eiden o he Coun ha

accordingly made hase o moe o a

heroically, clearing ou much of he

The Meuse In fron of he Chaeau
Lagunay was perhaps a quarer o£ a
mile wide, running swifly beneah
high, precipious banks in which here
was no break or a considerable dis
ance norh and souh Some hree
miles down sream he rien nar
rowed, a he own of Ramune, "Eiiere
a, massie sone bridge spanned he
deep waers This poin was seleced
by he Germans for crossing Lea
ing imee wih a srong guard of
armed serans, some of whom serc
eerans of he FrancoPrussian war,
I se ou on horseback for Ramune,
looking like • a French dandy in my
elegan clohes 
I found he own in grea confusion
Many persons were loading up heir
household goods and making ready for
deparure; ohers had already fled So
sealhily had he Germans approached
ha heir adance a ha poin was
unknown half a dozen hours before my
arrial
 From a sone ower on a wooaed
hill back of he own I looked across
ino he alley beyond s far as he
eye could see sreched he ranks of
he inaders They had risen ou of
Prussia and Baden and Saxony, ou of
Wuremburg and Brunswick, ou of
Hesse and he Mecklenburgs; and mob
ilizing rapidly had swarmed across he
fro ier of Lorraine, ha ancien bone
of conenion, and neural Luxemburg
s I learned laer, once hey sepped
upon French soil hey swep down like
a sorm Spies preceded hem cuing
elegraph wires in all direcions The
hiry miles beween he fronier and
he Meuse Rier had been coered in
en hours, he roops moing a a
swinging ro nd here hey were a
he crossing wihou he leas show
of opposiion
Meanwhile he French were adanc
ing wih characerisic deliberaion,
heir main force being hen a and
around he grea miliary camp of
Chalons, some fify miles o he souh
wes They had been apprised on he
preious day of he appearance a he
fronier of seeral bodies of Lancers
and Hussars There had been no
furher repors, (he wires were cu
abou ha ime) and i appeared un
necessary o make any decided moe
Of he deachmens sen ou in auo

he illfaed La Jaune, I could hear
nohing I was no unil monns

chines reached he rendezous, did a
lile scouing on heir own hook,
found nohing suspicious, and oured
leisurely back o Paris and Chalons,
where hey repored ha he sory, or
a norhern Inasion was a canard
Therefore he mobilizing proceeded, all
eyes being cenered on Luneille, Bel
for and Besancon, where he German
Crown Prince, wih his Baarian, army
manoeured a a safe disance, hrea
ening, rereaing, building mock fori
ficaions, and seadily pulling h Ger
man wool oer he French eyes
There was no defense possible for
Ramune, an old, proincial own wih
weak forificaions Ye he small

cannon, which seemed o anger he
Germans  baery of morars was

IN  FEW MINUTES THE ENTIRE TOWN WS BLZE

Unhindered, he Germans swep

I had hardly arried and arranged

He pushed me aside wih an oah

Jos Baer Co if Baery Place $ r lydew or rain, or until the soil
is sufficiently dry to crumble between
the fingers without adhering to them,
and if it can be avoided no foot should
ever press the cultivated ground. The
most efficacious tool in any garden is
a sharp and narrow rake, which should
be constantly run between the rows
whenever the ground is dry. Except
in very wet seasons this implement
when frequently used will suffice to
keep down all weeds between the rows,
which it also keeps the soil sufficient
ly pulverized to act as a watering: pot
as well. An expert gardener seldom
needs to use a hoe, except when pre
paring his beds for a second crop, or
when a spell of rainy feather has
rendered the use of a rake unadyls
able for quite a long period. There
are several varieties of hand planters
on the market, the best of which save
much labor when planting the coarser
seeds, but a drill or wheel hoe is un
necessary in a small garden. ;
Many suburban gardeners have water
available. This is 1 1 not an j unmixed
blessing, for to spray plants in hot
dry weather is a fatal mistake. At
such times the foliage is not prepared
by nature to receive an artificial sup
ply of moisture, while If the plants
once become accustomed ' to it they
must have It regularly. Constant rak
ing is, far better than watering for if
no crust is allowed to form on the
surface of the soil the plants will al
ways find enough moisture, unless a
very long drought sets in. Even when
this is the case spraying should never
be resorted to; the only safe course to
pursue being to block the outlet drain
and to place the hose so as to fill the
drainage system, but even this must
never be done until after sunset Seed
should always be sown in dry soil but
immediately after a bed has been seed
ed quicker germination can be secured
by giving the ground a moderate soak
ing though after the young shoots ap
pear , they will not I send their roots
down deeply if constantly watered,
and the rootlets that penetrate the
soil in search, of moisture not only
find what they, are -after, but a good
deal of useful plant food as well. .''"'■
As to fertilizers, a wagon load or
two or fairly coarse manure may be
■used. to good advantage during the
trenching process If It is carefully
stamped down -on top \of the sod
thrown in the trenches, but afterwards
nothing but fine well rotted manure
should be used which, should be at
least two years old in order to avoid
the danger of importing the seeds of
noxious weeds. This should be thor
oughly incorporated with the soil after
the crops have been gathered in the
fall. As to commercial fertilizers,
outside lime and salt, though, good in
their place, I fancy amateur gardeners
are better without them. Really the
rake, besides being the best watering
pot, is the best fertilizer I know of,
for its constant use permits the air
to reach, the roots of the growing
plants and the atmosphere . carries
more elements necessary for vegetable
life than can be supplied by any
chemical compound.
With regard to second crops. No
gardener worthy the name ever per
mits any space to lie fallow, if it i 3
possible to raise a second crop, on it
The pea vines, as soon as picked over,
should be cleared away, and the space
they occupied sown with, beans, quick
growing varieties of which, may : be
planted with, good prospects of their
yielding a crop as late as mid July.
The only preparation the bed will need
is loosening up, not turning over, with
a four tined stable fork, and then hoe-
Ing in a barrowful of fine manure. The
first beans ready should also be fol
lowed by a second crop, early varieties
being chosen, and any ground that be
comes vacant between the end of Jury
and the middle of August should be
lightly sprinkled with turnip seed, and
well raked • over. After that date
radishes are the only safe crop to sow.
If these simple directions are faith
fully followed, especially those,relat
ing to the first preparations of the
ground, any, amateur gardener is
bound to raise a succession of crops
which will go far towards supplying
the family with green delecacies, even
if i his energies are confined to a very
limited area. ' " Pebcy Taylob.
LONG ISLAND'S BARREN LANDS.
Project to Make Them, Productive
—Railroad Making Experiments.
Another railroad has essayed tho
problem of reclaiming land. This
time it is the Long Island Railroad
Company. It has taken tinder Its con
trol a plot of land containing about
seventeen acres near the end of the
north shore of the island. The land
Is typical of much of that on Long Is
land, It is known as pine-barrens;
Is considered sterile and is in the full
est sense of the -word waste land.
The railroad company '■ will establish
an experimental fruit and vegetable
farm. The company also intends to
establish an experimental farm near
the middle of the island and another
on the south shore.
Suffolk county has an area of 730,
117 acres of which 40,000 have been
esteemed of so little value that they
have never been assessed for taxes,
and the value of 200,000 acres of the
remainder is so slight that the taxes
levied have been nominal. The des
patches telling of this experiment of
the Long Island Railroad announce
that several other railroad companies
will be interested spectators of the re
enlts, which if .satisfactory will be
accepted as examples worthy to be
followed.
American raidroads not only open
irp new land to settlement, but «xert
themselves to attract 6ettlers and al
so reclaim waste land. The railroads
of the west have done effective work
In promoting emigration to that section
and the roads of the south and south
west are now particularly active In
soliciting immigration. The southern
lines have perhaps done more than
a ? 77 rr i °J} ier & sency in turning the tide
0* Italian immigration Into the cotton
and sugar fields and the mm cities of
the aoutb.
Enough Is Eaoagh.
Quitting work with a million dollars
saved in twenty-five years, the mana
ger of the Waldorf-Astoria in New
York sets an example that might well
be followed by those men who get the
money-making craze and develop
from "captains of industry" through
"plutocrats" to something worse.
Thomas H. Hillard came from Ireland
when he had attained his majority.
He Is now forty-six and a millionaire,
having made it all in hotel manage
ment and a careful investment of his
savings. He Is of the opinion that he
has ■ worked hard enough and long
enough. Acquaintance with the range
of hotel prices, in connection with ho
tel tips, would indicate that he had
also worked people enough, although
there has been nothing in Mr. Hil
lard's career to show that he has ever
made an overcharge. On the other
hand, he has devised many of the
modern conveniences that add to the
delectability of hotel existence. But
the best thing he has done has been to
'■Tiow when he had enough and to
stop when he got it
Sine Million Plows at Work.
\ It's plowing time. Two hundred
million acres of land will be plowed
this year in the United States and
about 9,000,000 plows are on the farms
to do the work. The capital invested
in plows alone represents $80,000,000.
Such a , multitude of types of ! plows
and plowers can be found on this old
continent that we can but name a
few. In the great southwest the Mo
have with his three or four squaws
starts for the planting ground. Each
woman carried her digging stick, the
most primitive of fall plows, and the
man stands guard all day while the
"original farmers" of this country dig
the land and plant their gourd seeds.
In Canada but for the interference of
the government we might see the
Doukhabor women drawing the plow
in exactly the same way that they
have done for centuries. In New
England the oxen are being yoked,
and in the middle west the fourhorse
teams are ready. In the south , the
negro sits on his plow hilt to watch;
the train go by. i
In other parts of the country we find
traction engines i at ' work, plowing
forty or more acres a day and requir
ing but two or three men to do it
MISTAKES ABOUT NICOTINE.
Doesn't Accumulate in Pipe Stems—
Very Little Nicotine Poisoning.
There are probably few subjects
about which more people are misin
formed than nicotine.
N9arly everyone speaks of the dark
brown substance which has about the
consistency and color of molasses and
accumulates in the stems of pipes as
nicotine. According to a scientific ar
ticle, it is not nicotine at all, and It
has no nicotine in it ■
"It Is nothing but . tar — tobacco tar,
distilled from the smoke, just as coal
tar Is distilled from coal and pine tar
from pine wood. One might swallow
all the tobacco tar, that a rank clay
pipe contains without serious harm.
If he swallowed the same quantity ot
nicotine he would probably be dead
inside of five minutes. ■ •■.. . - '.
It is the tar that stains the pipe,
and it is the same tar that stains
the cigarette smoker's fingers. It is
also found , inside the nostrils of one
who inhales I smoke, and it puts jan
indelible stain on mustaches. \ ': \
.It is true that tobacco contains
more nicotine . than any, other known
plant, but nicotine is not a plentiful
article in nature. ■ '•■. The rankest • Ken
tucky tobacco contains less than 8 per
cent of nicotine, and the finer grades
of tobacco, such as Havana, have less
than 2 per cent \ . . . \
. One often hears cigarettes condemn
ed because the smoker gets so much
more nicotine through . inhaling | the
smoke. - The j fact is that a cigarette
smoker gets ' almost no nicotine, be
cause the tobacco of which cigarettes
are made contains ' next to no nico
tine. Turkish and N Egyptian tobaccos
carry only a trace jof nicotine, and
some of them none at all.
But no matter how much of this
deadly element a tobacco contains, 1
the smoker does not get it. Nicotine
is not extracted by burning the tobac
co. Burning destroys It entirely.
. One often hears of nicotine poison
ing, but it is very doubtful if there is
any such thing. When one is poison
ed with, nicotine he dies, and he
doesn't get poisoned by smoking.
There are plenty of good reasons why
smoking should not be carried to ex-,
cess, but nicotine poisoning is not
one of them.
