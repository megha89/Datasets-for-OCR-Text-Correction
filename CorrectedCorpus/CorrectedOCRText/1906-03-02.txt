"Monna Vanna" he ile role of which
is being essayed by Madame Berha
Kalich, a Polish acress who won fame
in he Yiddish heares on he Bowery
in New York Ciy
Madame Kalich may no be considered
a beauiful woman bu hrough he na

no know a word of English, ye her

Madame Berha Kalich is all and

She canno be classed as beauiful,
bu her ar has a mimicry which is

ough schooling on he merican sage,

feren from hose of he Russian, she
' will become famous, for she comes of
a race which has achieed wonders
nd when we encouner marked alen

predic how many rungs of he ladder of

while passing reflecions may be gien
o he abiliy of aid Garrick, Mrs

Berha Kalich's appearance in Chi

The Sociey was incorporaed under

The Sociey Is he ougrowh of a
hough expressed by Mrs Cynhia
Wesoer lden in he office of he
New York Recorder seeral years ago
during he holiday season Mrs lden
was he recipien of a number of cards
from her coworkers on he paper as
well as ouside friends fer enjoy

would hae been beer pleased if he
donors had no wrien heir names on

audience and wih one accord eery
one exclaimedPersonal
"Wha! You wouldn' gie oar pres

"Why no?" was he answer
"Wha do you do wih yours?" , 
 laughing inesigaion soon deel
oped he fac ha he wase baske
was he ulimae desinaion of mos
of he cards receied
"Le me gie you he hisory of one
prey encen card ha came o me
a year ago," said Mrs lden "I had
an exquisie poem on i, and I enjoyed
i so much ha I hough a once of
an old uncle who would appreciae i
and forwarded i o him He, as I
hough, did enjoy i, and so much
so ha he immediaely recalled an old
! friend o whom i would appeal wih
j special force So he copied he poem
and sen he card on This recipien
found he card so helpful ha she,
oo, fel called upon o pass i on and
before he seen days' holiday was
oer he card had carried is Chris
mas message o six differen persons
Of course his is excepional, bu is
sill an example of he infinie possi
biliies of a gif acceped in he rue
spiri and hen passed on, giing each
one he double deligh of receiing and
giing"
The cards which had afforded he
lile sermon were spread ou and were
(Coninued on nex page)found o possess many possibiliies of
happiness, which he markings spoiled
for passing on ( J
Inspired wih his idea of sending
ou remembrances ha migh be mul
iplied fourfold a new se of cards
was gien o Mrs lden by he Re
corder's saff and hese cards were a
once sen ou The hanks receied
for hem were so prey ha an iem
was made of hem in he New York
Recorder This caused furher corre
spondence and resuled in a club for

The name of "Cha" was a firs
chosen for he column, bu in ime he
membership grew so large ha he

in 1696 he name of he sociey was
changed o he "Sunshine" Sociey,

Someone whispered nerously o a
neighbor One or wo men lifed heir
beads and drew quick breahs People
glancsd from side o side, and a few
fee shuffled uneasily  Then a iny
puff of smoke came from he lef
wing and raelled as far as he middle
of he sage I was followed by a
larger, rolling cloud The effec was in
sananeou3
"Fire!" shrieked a shrill oice, and
a woman sared up franically "Fire!
Fire!"
In an insan he huge heare was
a seehing, swaying mass; from all
sides burs screams, sobs, and oahs
For a few seconds people were pushed
in purposeless groups hiher and hih
er Then suddenly he crowd broke
Ino rocking unwieldly secions, each
pushing, fighing, earing owards he
neares exi } 
In he middle of he house, ery
sill, sa a group of hres The Woman
was in he middle, he Husband on her
righ, he Oher Man on her lef For
he firs few seconds i seemed ca I
hey mus be swep off heir seas
Then • wih a quick moemen , ie
Oher Man wheeled half round oa his
chair, pu one hand on he back of
he Woman's sea and he oher on he
sea before her The Husband silen
ly followed his example They were
boh big srong men Their hands
me in a seady grip behind and in
fron of her Thus ill he rush was
oer hey formed a human cage for
her proecion, shuning off by !ielr
braced rigid frames, heir crowding,
franic neighbors
'"Thank you," she said quiely, when
he middle of he heare was desered
"I couldn' hae borne o be ouched
by sueh — animals" She gae a hur
ried glance a he neares mass of hu
maniy and hen fixed her eyes whim
sically on he smokeclouded sage in
fron "Wha do hey remind one of?"
she asked as hcugi hinking aloud
I was he Oher Man who answered
VPigs," he said conempuously; "pigs,
when he rough h^i Jus been filled,
—crowding oward i"
She half urned her head owards
"OH!" SHE CRIE "YOU'VE HU2T YOUR HN; IT'S BLEEING"
him "Tes," she said graely; "hey
do look like ha"
Suddenly he fireproof curain be Personal
gan o moe ;
'•Oh, hank Cod!" shrieked a fashion ,
ably dressed woman, her face made i
hideous by fear ;
 sea of oher faces, Earnped wih |
eery shade of error ani ferociy, ;
urned owards he saga a he cry 
For an insan he umul sank o some ;
hing like silence Hope and hankrul
ness arose in a housand breass Then ;
' he umul began again
"I's suck! Oh i's suck!" — and he
figh for life coninued in all Is
sickening cowardly saajrery
"Hae we any chance!" asked he !
Woman simply For a none nelhei
►answered Then again i was he Ohei
Man who spoke
"Unless hey ge he curain down
In ime, none" he answered
"There are no oher exis; I know
he place well I won' be he fire
probably, bu he — smoke In a minue
or wo we mius moe furher back
from i" He spoke wih admirable
resrain
nd hen suddenly he Husband
sood up They boh urned owards
him His face was gray, and his lips
rsmbled
"Ne his way," he murmured in a
shaking oio, "h merciful heaen,
no again his way! "
The Woman Quiered as beneah a
lash, and her fa"c became drawn
"Join!" she Fnid eharrf, "John!"
JTe sarelBl'rhlr "Yes?"
She would ro le her ops mee his
"Pease go, away," she said in a low
VCl"'s
He hesiaed a momen "Wha for?"

"On, I don' care Ge a whisky and
p^ria If you know where o find I or —
or perhaps you'd beer leae ou he
soda; I mean " She paused, shud
dering  "Only go," she added fainly
Wha did she mean? id she know
•wha she was saying Probably no,
he decided Wha had he Bald himself
a minue ago? He could no remember
Wha did anyhing maer now? He
we^ wihou a word
Tho Oher Mnn sared sraigh In
fro i of him His face, was a masic
For a minue hey sa ery sill Then

"Come," he said in an ordinary oice,
"s ime o moe"
She gae him her hand, and he help
ed her oer chairs and wooden forms
ill hey were a he back of he build
ing "Here?" she asked
"No," he said, and spread hip coa
on he floor; "Here, please The nearer
he ground, he less smoke, you Unow"
She sa down silenly, and moioned
him o share he coa Then suddenly
3he laughed
 "I's queer, isn' i," she said, "ha
we should hink abou geing • our
clohes dusy now?"
He did no answer' He was wising
a buon on hia oercoa round and
round; I came off in his hand Sud
denly he spoke "You are ery brae"
he said
She drew a quiering breah 'Tec

she said in a low oice <
He made no replyPersonal he did no wan

"I'm glad," she added hurriedly,
"ha we mcedPersonal Perhaps he will
no find us here"
He urned swifly, wih a rush of
joy "Elizabeh!" he cried 
"Then you are conen here \ wih

She brushed her hand across her

ing I'm angry and disressed and
'I'imiliaed I don' wan o die; bu

body brae like like you
"Elizabeh," he said passionaely,
"on' you know ?"
She sared "Oh, hush!" she mur
mured "I is so near he end"
"Tha is jus why,", he said, and
laughed recklessly "la a few minues
i mus ail ie oer Haen' we a

ioar^3 him, and she did no resi3_
She ,as hinking shamefacedly of he
grayness of er husband's face as she
had lac seen i The blood of a dozen
generaions of pioneera and warriors
'as surging hrough her own eins
and she scorned impending fae
"Tes," she said absenly, "I beliee

The scioke was rapidly hickening,

I86»3ShTear1903 /ss/_ b, and with the low price
. at which good' eggs, or practically pure
bred cockerels can be had, it is the
easiest thing imaginable to have, after
two or three years of systematic breed

three times the profit of the original
flock. -";; :■
Standard Kinds of Chickens.
A fascinating little bulletin has been
issued by the Department of Agricul
ture (farmers' bulletin No.' 51) which
is replete with illustrations of the prin
cipal standard ' varieties . of chickens,
the 'reading of which by any chicken
grower, however small, should certain
ly stimulate a New Year resolution to»
make the flock a real money earner.
TMs bulletin, while it will prove, prob
ably, a„» mere i stimulant for mo c
extensive literature on the subject, can
be obtained without cost' from Sena
tors and Members of Congress, or the
Secretary of Agriculture, and the proof
of its popularity is apparent In the
seven or eight editions which it has
been neessary to publish to supply the
demand' throughout the country.
Cap?nizing Fowls.
One of the most attractive features
of poultry raising is the production of
capons.- This is a story all by itself.
It is an experiment which one can en
ter Into and with a very slight expend
iture yt or a set of instruments, can fol
low it to any degree desired. It re
quires some judgment and a little at
tention, but caponizing is not difficult;
it is one of those things. which, while
it looks, in the beginning, to be a hard
proposition, gradually comes to you all
of itself, so that 'the first thing you
know you become • almost an expert,
and the reward is very considerable.
Capons always sell readily and at -a
good advance In price. The birds be
come very docile and easily handled
and are always money makers. . The
readiness wit- which the new capon
recovers from the wound is a revela-
FAMILIAR POULTRY SCENES
tion as to the splendid physical make
up of a chicken. Any boy or girl, who
has ever succeeded in skinning and
stuffing a bird will take hold of the
caponizing idea with avidity; in fact
caponizing is by far the "easier job; it
is as easy as the skinnng operation, for
in bird mounting the stuffing is the
really difficult part
ORIENTAL INCUBATORS.
Peculiar Facility of Chinese for Arti
ficial .latching.
If we are to look * the beginning
of any particular Industry, we are
usually told that we might find that
this particular work was first carried
on in China. This applies as well to
the artificial hatching of eggs.
Throughout China the hatching of eggs
by heat is a very large and important
industry and has been practiced since
very ancient times. The Oriental who
desires to hatch eggs by artificial heat
first constructs a building of sun
dried brick, plastered on the outside
With mud. Completely fill x one

Snan to test the eggs, are round, bar
rel-like mud brick walls with earthen
jars set into them. This j-.r Is \ n rz
deep, and comes within six or ei?ht
Inches of the ground. The conical bot
tom is filled with ashes to the depth
of eight or nine inches, to keep the
more uniform and to
avoid sudden chansres of . tMir»v»mrnr»
when doors are opened and ffcprf U n

living germs are sold on the street for
food at about one-sixth of a cent
each. . s£s!^S7
After being tested they are. kept in
tthe jars for seven days, being
changed as before. This makes a total
of eleven days la the jars. Then they
are taken in a bamboo basket • and
rolled out on a . mat on the
platform above the jars. .Here
they remain until hatched. The
only, heat they receive is from the
room, except during cold weather they
are covered with a heavy quilt After
they are hatched the chicks are put
in shallow baskets for a short time to
gain strength and then they are ready
for sale. . The hatch by th . remarka
ble method is from CO to 70 per cent
THE AMERICAN INCUBATOR IN TURKEY.
After testing, it is stated that 90 per
cent, of those remaining ", will hatch.
This style of incubator.- probably
would not suit American requirements,
>ut the idea of utilizing the heat of the
foom during the later stages of incuba
tion is very valuable, as it economizes
both heat and space.
POULTRY FEEDING.
An Important Phase of the Chicken
Crowing Industry.
Poultry feeding is sometimes a most
serious problem to those who desire to
make this line a specialty. ■ Experi
ence has shown that there are certain
special lines of agricultural operations
with which poultry raising may ad
vantageously be connected. dairy
ing there is usually a large' quantity
of skim milk' or butter-milk which
may be utilized to furnish a consider
able part of the poultry ration. Upon
the fruit farm fowls are also of ad
vantage. They keep down insect pests
and they. may have a free range a
greater part of the season without the
possibility of doing any damage. Plum
growers have found poultry especially
useful in obliterating the curculio, and
•even the apple crop has been consid
erably benefited. If it is found that
,t! <? fowls injure small fruits it is best
that they be confined during the lira
'ited season when the fruit is ripen
ing. Waste fruits, either in winter
or summer, are a wo'"ome and valua
ble addition to the poultry ration.
The market gardtin also furnishes a
large amount of waste products which
may be utilized for poultry feed.
There is the waste lettuce, the small
heads of cabbase. the unsold beets,
carrots and potatoes, the green corn
which cannot be marketed 'or any
BROOD OF INCUBATOR OSTRICHES. ' 1
purpose, the waste of the tmall fruits,
etc. If properly cared for the hens
will bring a stc. Ly and reliable In
come during the winter months.
Dried clover, roots, tu'>ers, etc., should
be save*! for them during the winter.
These sncMiM be steamed and fed with
the mash or cabbac-*s, and beets may
be fed raw. A <?atch crop of buckwheat
or oafs and peas will furnish much
food'at little expense, xsran. meat,
meal, svheat screenings and oats pur
chased for poultry will bring good re
-|turns in eggs and will also . dd ma
terially to the fertilizer supply.
