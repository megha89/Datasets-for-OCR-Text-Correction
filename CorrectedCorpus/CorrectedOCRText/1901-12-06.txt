away to play with other boys and girls
in the street The girl looked after hlin
wistfully, a shadow on her face She
did not care to blow bubbles any more

Fire Among Saage Nations
! According to Pliny fire was a long
time unknown to some of the ancient
Egyptian tribes, and when a celebrated
astronomer made them acquainted with
that element and how to produce It
they were wild with delight The Per
sians, Phoenicians, Greeks and seeral
other nations acknowledge that their
ancestors were once without the com
forts which fire bestows; the Chinese
confess the same of their progenitors
Pompanio*, Mola, Plutarch and other
ancient writers speak of nations which,
at the time when they wrote, knew not
the use of fire or had just recently
learned it
j The inhabitants of the Marian
Islands, which were discoered In 1551,
bad no Idea of fire or its uses Their
astonishment knew no bounds when
they saw it applied to wood, most of
them taking it to be some kind of an
animal which the sailors had brought
•with -them and which must be fed on
wood
- All Charged but the Cork
A good story Is told of a digger who
had ridden Into a Western Australian
town to consult a doctor Haing done
so, he went to hae the prescription
made up
"How much is this lot?" he asked
the chemist
"Well, let me see," was the replj
"There's seen and sixpence for the
medicine and a shilling for the bottle"
He hesitated, uncertain whether he
had charged for eerything
"Oh,, hurry up, Ik>ss," said the impa
tient miner; "put a price on the cork
and let us know tbe worst"— London

"Very well, grannie," he said, and he
proposed to the first on the list When
lie came back with his wife from their
wedding tour, they went to pay their
respects to the old lady
"Well, now," she said, "I am the root,
and you are only the branches, and
therefore you must always pay me a
great deal of deference"
"That Is all ery well," said Jack
Impertinently, "but I think the branches

iAN OVERWORKED PHRASE
The Expression "He Took Ills Life In
His Hands", j
; "The expression 'he took his life In
his hands' always struck me as being
ery foolish," said a bright younggen
tlcinan, "and I hae often wondered
why so many persons ; persist in using
ftwhen they want to speak of extraor
dinary dangers Now, extraordinary
danger 'is one thing and the simple,
commonplace thing of taking one's own
life in one's hands Is an entirely differ
ent thing-
 "I work In a big building There are
a steam engine and a mammoth boiler
in the basement Wheneer I enter
that building, If they arc running the
engine in the basement, I take my life
In my hands I get on the eleator on
the fifth floor; I take my life in my
hands I go out of ; town; the car
may tumble oer a trestle somewhere
I walk along the street; a sign may
fall on me I make my way across the
thoroughfare; | who knows but what
a street car or a ehicle of some 'sort
may not run me down? I cross the ri
er; may l not suddenly find myself in
the swirling stream and sinking for
the last time? If I walk along the
street, may not a brick or a loosened
cornice come crashing down upon me?
There are a row and a shot or two on
the corner; may not a stray bullet wing
me? And so on 
"Pessimism? No Logic That's all
It just shows the difference between
taking one's own life in' one's hand
and the matter of confronting extraor
dinary danger These risks are ordi
nary, plain, old, eeryday risks  The
fireman who dashes Into a burning
building to rescue a child, the fellow
who grabs the bridle of a runaway
horse, the hero wh\> will plunge into
the rier to sae some person who is
about to drown — these are the persons
who confront what I would call ex
traordinary dangers, and the worn
platitude of saying of one of these 'he
took his life In his hands' would not
fit the case because there would be in
the act an element of heroism which
would place it much aboe the com
monplace"—New Orleans Times-Dem

HOYT'S JOKE ON M'KEE
How the Playwright Hud a Bit of
Fun With His Manager
On one occasion Manager McKee
was watching a performance from a
box, where he was seated with some
friends
During the first act an usher came
to him with the information that a
gentleman was waiting at the door to
see him on most Important business 
"Tell him I can't couie out— l'm ery
busy," was the answer
The usher returned in a moment to
say that' the man insisted on seeing
Mr McKee, who again sent out word
that it was impossible to see him
The man outside then sent In the
message that he was an author and
had a play that he wished McKee to
read Immediately ' •
This Incensed the manager, who said
to the usherPersonal
"Tell that fool out there that this is
no time to bring a play to be read
Get him out of the place — I won't see
him I won't read his play"
• A few minutes later the usher came
back and Informed McKee that the
man utterly refused to go without see-
Ing him, and that he must be granted
an Interiew, also that he was quite
sure that the manager would not only
read his play, but he would also pro
duce it, and added that he would bet
?1,000 that Hoyt & McKee would be
only too glad to get the play Personal;Personal;'
At that McKee became furiously
angry, and,, excusing himself to his
party, left the box with the intention
of personally initing the persistent
author to begone
"Where's that idiot who insists on
seeing me?" he asked of the treasurer
at the box office • Then the treasurer
pointed to a man standing in the shad
ow with a roll of manuscript under
his arm / 
It was Hoyt, with his newly finished
play, which he handed to McKee, who
said to those presentPersonal
"It's on me— what'll you hae, boys?"

Odors That Permeate Foodstuffs
A fish dealer in one of the most styl
ish parts of New York was deeply hurt
and badly worried one day by the com
plaint of one of his big customers that
a fine salmon which he had sent to the
house for a big dinner had proed to
be entirely uneatable when sered ow
ing to a most penetrating taste of creo
sote that peraded it The fish dealer
realized, although the charge was not
made directly, that he was more than
suspected of haing sold a stale fish
that had been washed or brushed with
an antiseptic preparation to hide Us
condition He knew that the salmon
had been perfectly fresh when he sold
It, and for claye lie pusaleU in ain wr
the problem But suddenly he remem
bered that on the day the fish was sent
out- a tank wagon full of creosote had
stopped before his place and th-n hl>
cart, Into which the -fish was lWng
placed, was directly alongside of the
powerful stuff That appears to" hae
been enough to permeate the delicate
flesh of the fish— New York Press

tact with arious • forms of Infectious
materials that iiiay proe of serious
consequence when burled In the tis
sues Personal Moreoer, reoler cartridges
are coered with a coating of grease,
and this eucourages an accumulation
of manifold uiicrobic material, some of
which may proe to be of irulently
Infectious nature

sterilized by the Intense heat deeloped
by the powder at the moment of their
discharge Their rapid progress through
the air while In a heated condition still
further seres to cleanse them of any
extraneous wateriiU, that may chance
to hae accumulated on their surfaces
This cleansing process is ery effectu
ally begun by the rifling of the rifle
barrel through which the bullet forces
Its way
All these faorable factors are lack
ing in the ease of the reoler bullet,
and so it Is possible that in any gien
case such a bullet may carry Infectious
material with it into the tissues If
this were In small amount, nature
might effectually wall it off and uo ro
rious consequences result On the oth
er hand, such Infectious material might
lie seemingly dormant for days, but
really slowly gathering strength by
multiplication, and when Its toxins
were elaborated In sufficient amount
they might paralyze protectie cheuio

ONE MAN'S LUCK
Steered Into a Junior Partnership
by a Chnnce Guxt of Wind
"Speaking of taking in partners,"
said a downtown business man, "our
junior was, you might say, blown in on
us, and I saw him started In our di
rection, though I bad no idea of it at
the time
"Going down town one summer morn
ing on a Ninth aenue eleated train
I 6aw sitting opposite to me a young
man who caught my fancy, a substan
tial, earnest, straightforward looking
chap, whose looks I liked first rate He
was reading a paper, and presently he
tore off from his paper an adertise
ment leaf tliat he didn't want and
threw It out of a window or tried to,
for as a matter of fact It didn't go out
A gust of wind with just the right
twist to it came along at just that mo
ment and blew the paper back, to fall
on a acant seat nest to him
"And as it fell something in it caught
his eye, and he picked up that part
which he had just been trying to throw
away and began earnestly to read it
and ended up by folding it carefully
and putting -it in his pocket
"About four mluutos after I'd got in
here that morning this same young
man walks In and applies for a place
that we had been waiting for some
body to fill Our adertisement for a
man for It was in that paper which I
had seen this young man try to throw
away, and which a gust of wind, by
one chance in a million or more, had
blown back upon him and In such a
manner as to fix his attention
"As a matter of fact I hadn't liked
the young man's act of throwing the
paper out of an eleated car window

A CORDIAL RECEPTION
The Book Astmt Got One That
Wasn't Intended For Him
There is a farmer liing just north
of Einston and a book agent some
where In the cosmopolitan desert of
Chicago each of whom feels that he is
a ictim of a cruel circumstance
Last week the farmer had a note
from a nephew to say that the boy
would isit the farm on Thursday
Uncle anil nephew had not met for fif
teen years, and the old man droe to
the station in his most uncomfortable
coat that he might welcome his sister's
child But the young man failed to
arrie After waiting till the last pas
senger had disappeared the old man
droe away, disappointed
The book agent entered Into the dra
matis personic early the next morning
Looking oer the top rail of the barn
yard gate, he called, "Hello, uncle!"
The book agent neer got such a re
ception before In all his life The farm
er flung the gate wide open, seized the
agent's hand and pressed a whiskered
kiss on the ironclad cheek
"Say, this must be heaen," mur
mured the agent, following the farmer
into the house and explaining that e
erybody at home was as well as could
be expected Not till the agent was
full of a boiled dinner and attempted
to sell a book did the farmer begin to
see a dim light Charged with Imper
sonating the missing nephew, the
agent explained that he greeted all
elderly strangers as "uncle;" that he
een had a few almost real ones in
South Clark street in Chicago
When last seen by the farmer, the
agent was still running, and when the
real nephew does come he may find an
electric current in the latchstrlng—

The Bent Man
For the origin of "the best man at a
wedding" we must go back many cen
turies, to days wheu it was the amia
ble practice of the budding bridegroom
to dispense with the consent either of
the lady or her father lie simply
waited for a suitable opportunity to
capture her and make a bolt with his
bride In this enterprise lie found it
helpful to hae the serices of a friend
who would neslst him in the capture
and keep -the pursuers at bay until he
had got a sufficiently long start This
friend was the prototype of the "best
man" of our own uuromantlc day,
when his duties are limited to seeing
that the bridegroom doesn't leae the
ring behind him or leae the church
without taking his hat with him How
times do change!

them who was crooked whence she
came, she replied, "Straight from Lon
don"
"Confound me, madam," said he,
"theu* you must hae been warped by
the way!"
She soon, howeer, had ample re
enge The following eening he join
ed her company and, with a sneer and
a bow, asked her If she knew her cate
chism and could tell him the name of
Toblt's dog
"His name, sir, was Nash," replied
the lady, "and an Impudent dog lid

Potion l»y Absorption
The slow absorption of many poisons
changes In some more or less modified
form the complexion, but arsenic and
ammonia show their effect about as
quickly as any The popular belief
that arsenic clears the complexion haa
led many silly women to kill them
seles -with Jt in small, continued
doses
It produces a waxy, lorjiike appear
ance of the skin during a certain stage
of the poisoning, but Its terrible after
effects hae become too well known to
make It of common use as a cosmetic
The effects of ammonia upon the
complexion are directly opposite from
that of arsenic The first symptoms of
ammonia poisoning which  appears
among those who work In ammonia
factories is a discoloration of the skin
of the nose and forehead This gradu
ally extends oer the face until the
complexion has a stained, blotched and
unsightly appearance With people
who take ammonia Into their systems
In small doses, as with their water
and -food, -these striking symptoms do
not appear so soon The only effect of
the poison that is isible for a time is
a general unwholesomeness and sal
lowness of the complexion
Undigested Food
The recurrence of the flaor of food
for some time after eating is always
an Indication, writes a physician in a
medical journal, that the food is not
being properly digested "I can taste
It," we say after eating canned fruits
and egetables presered by adding
salicylic acid or formaldehyde, sub
stances that embalm food against the
digestie juices as completely as they
protect It from the microbes of the
outer air And "I can taste it" would
probably be the report of one who had
made a hearty meal on a turkey kept
seeral months In cold storage "A
man trying to lie on such meat would
simply stare to death or die of blood
poisoning," adds the physician '
He does not fail to remind us that
the storage warehouse Is generally a
conenience and a J benefit and only
when misused a source of danger But
neither he nor any one else could find
a good word to say for manufacturers
who put slow poison Into a food prod
uct The fitting punishment for them
would be to gie them nothing to eat
but their own canned stuff
The Dtrd That Files Longest
Mr J Lancaster, naturalist, who
spent flye years on the west coast of
Florida study ing birds there, came to
the conclusion that of all the feathered
tenants of the air the frigate bird can
fly the longest without resting He has
seen one flying for a whole week night
and day without repose 
The frigate bird can feed, collect ma
terials'for Its nest and een sleep on
the wing Apparently Its wings can
be controlled automatically, without
the power of its will, and It probably
adapts Itself to take adantage of the
upward or bearing force of the wind
The spread of/ the frigate bird's wing
is great, and it can fly at a speed of
ninety-six miles an hour, without seem
ing to flap Its wings much   •
The albatross— that "king of the high
seas," as it has been called— is larger
than the frigate bird, but If It follows
a essel for four or fie days it has to
rest on a rock or on the ship itself
Proing Polarization
The polarization of' the human body
can be proed by allowing a strong
current to flow through the body from
one end to the other, the hands being
placed in two basins connected with
the poles The hands are then dried
and placed In two other basins of wa
ter connected with the wires of a deli
cate galanometer A current la the
reerse direction to the original one Is
then found to flow from the body

Ten Cents Per Copy
COUNTERFEIT GOLD
GILDING POWDERS ARE MADE OF
COPPER AND SPELTER
How the Material That Gies the
Shilling, Metallic Finish to Mirror
and Picture Frames Is Produced
Gold Leaf Without Gold
Personal How many persons who see the shin-
Ing gold In colored printing and on
mirror anS picture frames know that
gold does not enter at all into the com
position of the stuff that produces these
golden effects 7
' The shining metallic effect is pro
duced by a fine powder made from a
mixture of bronze and spelter This
offers the cheapest and best means of
giing the rich surface demanded in
wall papers, printing, lithography, fres
coing and In a ast range of manufac
tured articles of wood, paper and Iron
I The material used Is so called Dutcb
metal, an alloy of copper and spelter
The relatie proportions are aried to
produce different olors The larger
the percentage of spelter the lighter or
more yellowish will be the tint of the
alloy
The copper and spelter are smelted In
graphite crucibles containing about 400
pounds of metal, which, when com
pletely fused,  Is run off Into molds,
forming half round ingots two feet
long by half an inch In thickness Aft
er cooling these are bound into bundles
and sent to the rolling mill, where they
are passed cold nine times through a
double set of steel rolls under enor
mous pressure This flattens them and
draws them out Into thin ribbons from
50 to CO feet long and something more
than one Inch wida Cold rolling un
der such extreme pressure makes the
metal brittle, so it passes to the an
nealing furnace, ' which Is heated by
wood fire, as the sulfhur In coal or
coke would be Injurious to the ribbons 
! Haing been softened and rendered
ductile by annealing, they are cleansed
fa an acid bath, cut into lengths of
about three feet and collected In bun
dles of 40 or 50 strips each They are
laid between sheets of zinc and passed
under hammers which beat the metal
strips to the thinness of tissue paper
This requires six successie beatings,"
and great skill must be exercised to
produce a 'uniform and unbroken folL
After the third beating the metal strips
are taken from between the sheets of
zinc, loosened from "!" each other and
cleansed by immersion in a bath of
tartrate of potassium The cleaning is
repeated after the last beating, and the
sheets are hung on lines to dry In the
beginning the rolled strips are a dull
gray metallic color, at the fourth beat
ing the yellowish color begins to show,
and after the sixth they are clear and
bright as gold
PersonalThe defectie leaes are then thrown
out and the perfect ones cut into small
squares, which are laid together by
hand In packets of seeral hundred
each and Inclosed within an enelope
of sheet brass The packets return to
the annealing furnace, where they are
softened by heating and slow cooling,
and then go to the beaters, where they
are reduced under flattening hammers
to the thinness of real gold leaf, so thin
that It can be blown away by the
breath
The manufacture of bronze powder
consists Id grading, clipping and pul
erizing the arious bronze foils to an
een, Impalpable powder and is an In
dustry of comparatiely recent date
It began as a means of using up and
utilizing the imperfect leaes which
came as waste from the beaters of
gold, siler and bronze These were
cut by hand  into fine clippings and
then ground to powder in hand mills of
simple construction With the lapse of
time and the spread of artistic Indus
tries the uses of bronze powder In
creased until the demand far outran
the supply of waste, and the leaf metal
is now made on a large scale
The beating process flattens out a
pound of copper and spelter alloy to an
area of about 500 square feet, and in
this condition the square sheets as they
come* from the brass enelopes are
sheared into small fragments and rub
bed with olie oil through a steel siee
haing ten meshes to the inch and then
, passed to the stamping and grinding
machines, where they are pulerized by
steam or water power to the bronze
powder of commerce The grinding
occupies from one to four hours, ac
cording to the grade or quality of the
powder to be produced, which Is of
four grades, from coarse to superfine
TJie superfluous oil Is remoed by heat-
Ing under pressure, and the powder
is then carried Into centrifugal clarl
ficrs, or grading machines, which, turn
ing at a high speed, expel the powder
through fine orifices in the form of
dust, which settles on Inclosed sheles,
according to weight and fineness, the
finer particles at the top, the coarser
below, and In this way the powder is
diided into its arious grades— New

In 1775 the bankers of London rented
a house In Lombard street and fitted It
with tables and desks for the use of
their clerks as a place where bills,
notes, drafts and other commercial pa
per might be exchanged without the
trouble of personal isits of employees
to all the metropolitan banks Trans- 
fer tickets were used, and by means of
this simple plan transactions Inoling
many millions were settled without a
penny changing hands The Bank of
England and eery other important

Clearing House association The first -
clearing house in the United States
was established by the associated

Congress met last Monday The

paced in its American ideas, and in
its continuation of the policy inaug
urated by McKinley It has 're
ceied the wi<ftst commendations
from foreign journals It takes a
firm stand on all the leading ques
tions now agitating the people On
the one burning issue before the
Pacific coast — the continued exclu
sion of the Chinese — the message is
strongly in faor of the reenactment
of the Geary law It faors the in
dependence of Cuba at the earliest
practicable moment; the building of
the canal across the Panama isthmus;
the acquirement of the Danish West
Indies; the upbuilding of our mer
chant marine ; the reclamation of
the arid lands by irrigation It dis
faors any radical reision of the
tariff, and this recommendation will
be cordially indorsed by repub
licans generally ;" We hae no space

Altogether it shows that we hae
in President Rooseelt an able and
earnest adocate of those republican
principles and policies which hae
conducted the nation to its present
proud position of uparalleled great

 RESOLUTIONS
Hr Chairman— Your committee beg to report
that it is our belie* that while there Is in our
county a great difficulty in so arranging our
programs as to comply with the requirement of
the recent school law, which limits recitations
to twenty a week, and still coer our course of
study, any attempt to do so at the expense of
known and proed truths in regard to child edu
cation, and especially the confining of the
child's attention to one subject the entire day,
is deemed unwise Your committeo recommend
that the superintendent request each teacher in
the county to study carefully the problem of
reconciling the law and the course, and report
to him within a certain time Tor the benent of
all concerned

O "^Reichling^of Jackson, Amador
county, , and' the marriage ceremony
was performed by Re John Stephens,
who, besides a ery few intimate
friends, was the only one to wish them
well in life's journey and their honey
moon trip to Southern California
This wedding is of unusual interest,
as it Unites a promiucnt local newspa
per man and tbe founder of the order

considerable time in Europe and Sibe
ria ' But it is as the founder of the
order of Natie Daughters that the now
Mrs Dyer is best known, and that her
high ideals of womanly position hae
become fully realized Possessed of
indomitable energy, she oercame most
discouraging obstacles in her effort to
make the Natie Daughter of Califor
nia the compeer of the Natie Son
Although the founder of the order, she
would neer accept recognition of her
efforts by being elected its grand presi
dent It has eer been her aim and
intent to firmly impart her own
ideals in the workings of the fraternity
She is greatly loed by all Natie
Daughters, especially those of the in
terior

Sutter Creek Incorporation,
Action on the petition for the incor
poration of Sutter Creek was deferred
so as to gie tho people of that burg
an opportunity to study up the boun
dary lines, and ascertain if further
changes are desired There were no
anti-incorporationists before the board,
still in the exercise of its discretion and
for the best interest of all concerned,
it was deemed wise to postpone action
The boundaries of the proposed incor
poration hae, been considerably re
duced -from "the original "proposition
It was at first contemplated to take in
about 1000 acres But owing to seri
ous objections the Central Eureka mine
and all the property on Sutter hill was
thrown out, reducing the area to about
700 acres The superisors hae no
discretion -in the matter of calling an
election, so the law was interpreted
"when the Jackson case was before the
board It is likely that a special elec
tion will be called in the latter part of
January to decide the issue in Sutter
Creek V  -
Double Passenger Serice to Continue
We are pleased to be able to announce
that there is no truth in the reports
that hae been circulated that the
double train passenger serice is to be
discontinued on the Amador branch
railroad Hon E C Voorheis, on
hearing the report that the old-time
regime was to be reied, wrote to the
railroad company on the subject, and
promptly receied a reply to the effect
that there neer has -been any inten
tion of reducing the ' passenger serice
Both rnorning and afternoon exclusie
passenger trains will be continued right
along, the only freight to be attached
thereto will be of a perishable nature
that demands rapid transportation
Mr Voorheis, when in Jackson last
Monday, showed a representatie of the
Ledger a letter from the railroad auth
orities to this effect

Mining Notes
TEST Rhn^-Joo Gardella of the
Bjg Bar bridge, has been making a test
crushing of fie ton of ore liom his
quartz mine, adjacent to the bridge
The rock was run through the Light
House mill ; There are parties looking
at the mine with a iew of purchasing,
if the test proes satisfactory Wo
hae not heard how the rock panned
out
Upper Ranchekia— A test run
was made seeral days, ago at the ce
ment grael mine at Upper Rancheria
in the new roller quartz mill The re
sult we hae not learned The com
pany, which is composed mainly of
New York capitalists, has spent a large
sum in fitting up the property for actie
operations The milling capacity is
equal to 150 tons per day There is
plenty of grael in the bank, but
whether it carries enough gold to proe
remuneratie remains to be decided
Mining at Forest Home— There
is considerable work in progress in the
way of preparations for grael mining
on the Finch ranch near Forest Home
The property has recently been leased
to a man named Miller and others,
from Edgar Ekels Twenty men are
at work grading, and putting up ei<*ht
Huntington mills The ground has
been worked oer before, but it is be
lieed that it will pay to rework with
modern appliances The company in
tends to operate the mills with oil as
fuel

DANGEROUS FISHES
THEY ARE NOT ALL CONFINED TO
THE SEAS THAT ARE SALTY
The Alligator Gar Is One Freah Wa
ter Species That la Feared In the
South— A Mysterious Monster That
Inhabits a Michigan Lake
So far as any danger from the game
Is concerned, fresh- water fishing has
always been looked upon as about as
safe as any sport In the world, and the
fresh water fish has gouc on record as
harmless and nonresistant But there
are instances now and then when the
fish turns the tables The Inhabitants
of Osceola county, Mich, who lie in
the neighborhood of Lake George, an
inland water about three miles long,
are almost supers tltlously afraid, of a
certain fish that inhabits that lake No
one knows what sort of fish it Is, and
opinion locally is diided as to whether
it is Personal• giant muskellunge or a stur
Personal geonl
Spearing parties had now and then
reported seeing a cry large fish with
out being able to strike it, but no one
gae credence to the tales until one
night seeral years ago, when a party
of sportsmen from Chicago went on the
lake spearing in charge of an old resi
dent named Armstrong
Armstrong was the only one that re
turned to tell the story He said the
party was spearing in shallow water
when they saw an enormous fish that
resembled an oergrown pickerel Two
of the Chicago men were standing In
the bow, and at first supposed the fish
to be a log Then one saw his mistake
and struck with all his might The fish
gae a dart that made the boat jump
as though a steam engine were pulling
it If the maa had let go of the spear,,
all would 'l/' Ien well, but he hung
on, and the fish gae a mighty flop to
right angles with the boat The man
still held to the spear, with the result
that the boat capsized, and the men
found themseles standing In mud and
water up to their waists
The light went out when the boat up
set, and, the night being dark and
cloudy, not one of the party had, any
idea of the direction to be pursued hi
reaching shore The shallow water oc
cupies a large part of the lake, and
they could wander In any direction
without being able to tell whether or
not they were nearlng shore Arm
strong said afterward that nothing
could equal the awfulness of the expe
rience that followed They made their
way In one direction after another and
wandered round and round, going half
way to their knees In mud at eery
step
To make matters worse a cold,
steady, drizzling rain  began to fall
They were soon numb to the marrow
Then one of the sportsmen dropped
without a word, and no one went to his
holp Little by little the three that re
mained were separated Armstrong
says he himself became unconscious
after a time and remembers noth
ing that happened until he was roused
by feeling solid ground beneath his
feet and finding that the water was
more shallow than It bad been He
kept on and fell upon the shore Then
on hands and knees he crawled to
camp and gae the alarm Search was
at once made for his companions, and
their bodies were recoered Since that
time the big fish with a scar on his
back has twice or thrice been seen by
spearing parties, but they hae passed
it by
There is one species of fish In the
south that Is feared only little less

a gar grabbed him by one leg The
man hung to the boat until rescued,

fish hae been known to attack In like
manner negroes who went swimming
In the Mississippi below New Orleans
One spring the writer was isiting a
rice plantation on the "lower coast" of •
the Mississippi when an old negress
came wailing to the house and said her
fie-year-old boy was dead He had
been playing at the edge of, a bayou
and was lying on the bank extending
his arms into the water when a gar
came with a rush and, grabbing the
youngster by the arm, pulled him Into
the water A young negro with a shot
gun was standing near watching for
rlcebirds He ran to the bank The
fish found it had undertaken a bigger
task than it could well manage, and a
wild struggle was in progress between
the gar and the dying child The negro
shot the fish, but the child died before
it could be taken from the water— New

PARTRIDGE EGGS
Bald to Be More Nutrition* Than tho
liirrtx Thenuelea
' "Few persons are aware of the fact,"
said a' well known physician, "but it Is
true, neertheless, that the egg of the
partridge Is one of the most nutritious
things in the world They are not used
for eating purposes except in ery rare
cases, and then It generally happens In
remote rural districts I hae known
negro families in the state of Louisiana
during the laying season to lie on the
eggs of partridges And they would
flourish handsomely and grow'fat on
account of the rich properties of the
eggs
"These eggs, of course, neer find
their way Into the market because they
are neer taken from their nest except
by such persons as I hae mentioned,
End they rob the nests, I suppose, be
cause their principal food supply comes
from this source Quail meat comes
pretty high In the market at all times,
and the aerage man will find It more
profitable to spare the eggs srad wait
for the birds when the hunting season
rolls around These men would pass
100 nests in one day without disturbing
an egg The sport of hunting the birds
Is an additional incentie
"The aerage negro does not care so
much about this aspect of the case He
figures that the white man, haing the
best gun and the best dog, will beat
him to the bird So he goes after the
egg One partridge will lay anywhere
from 12 to 20 eggs, and a nest is a good
find I know of many families In rural
sections who feast on these eggs in the
laying season I hae tried the egg
myself as an experiment I found It
peculiarly rich It has a good flaor, is
ery palatable and in fact is altogether
a ery fine thing to eat Really I be
liee that the egg has more nutrition
In it than the fully deeloped bird, but
of course, as one of the men fond of
the game In the field, I would like to
discourage the robbery of the nests"—

MEMORY'S PRANKS
Why Do We Remember Certain
Thing;* and Forget Others T
The agaries of memory are some of
the most interesting of those connected
with the human mind and body Why
do we forget certain things and re
member others? Myriads of these ir
regularities are as yet unaccounted
for Perhaps not een the cleerest
metaphysician will eer account for
them
Professor James reminds us how
something which we hae tried in ain
to recall will afterward, when we hae
gien up the attempt, "saunter Into
the mind," as Emerson says, as inno
cently as if it had neer been sum
moned 
Again, bygone experiences will reie
after years of obliion, often as the
result of some cerebral disease or acci
dent
Such a case is the one quoted by
Coleridge of a young woman in Ger
many who could neither read nor write,
but who was said to be possessed of a
deil because, in a feer, she was heard
raing in Latin, Greek and in an ob
scure rabbinical dialect of Hebrew
Whole pages of her talk were written
down and were found to consist of
sentences intelligible In themseles, but
not haing the slightest connection
with one another To say that she was
possessed of a deil was the easiest
way of accounting for the matter
At last the mystery was cleared up
by a physician, who traced back the
girl's history until he learned that at
the age of nine she was taken to lie
at the house of an old pastor, a great
Hebrew scholar, and that she remain
ed there until the pastor's death It
had been for years the old man's cus
tom to walk up and down a passage
near the kitchen and read to himself
In a loud oice
His books were examined, and among
them many of the passages taken down
at the young woman's bedside were
Identified The theory of demoniacal
possession  was abandoned — Youth's

Dilating Tea
Few housekeepers remember, as they
should, that when it is necessary to
dilute strong tea It should be done with
water at the boiling point • The "poor
flaor of tea, made strong at first and
then reduced, such as Is too often ser
ed at receptions and "at homes," Is
usually caused by the addition of hot,
not boiling, water to the first Infusion
A lesson In this matter may be had
from the Russians, who sere the moet
delicious tea In the world, and who pre
pare It first ery strong, making It al
most an essence of tea This Is diluted
to the strength' wished, with water
kept boiling In ' the samoar This
water Is not allowed' to boll and reboll,
but Is renewed as needed Freshly
boiled water is  Insisted upon by all
connoisseurs In teamaking
Celling* and Ventilation
Rooms with low ceilings or with ceil
ings een with the window tops are
susceptible of more perfect entilation
than those with high ceilings In such
rooms the leakage at the windows,
which Is constantly going on, keeps the
air In motion throughout the room,
whereas If the celling Is higher only the
lower part of the air Is moed, and an
Inerted lake of foul and hot air Is left
floating in the space aboe the window
tops This lake, under the law of dif
fusion of gases, keeps actiely at work,
fouling the fresh currents circulating
beneath It  "
