JACKSON, AMADOR COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MARCH 8, 1901
Polly Larkin
Does it ever occur to you that there
would be a vast number of better, men
and women as well as better boys and
girls in this world if encouragement
had been given them in the same ratio
that fault-finding and out and out con
demnation had been bestowed upon
them? There is not one person in a
hundred that rises above the fault-find
ing and little sarcastic remarks that
ring in their ears for their failure in
small as well as the big affairs of life
They lose heart and feel that all the
sacrifices they can make and all their
good intentions and kindly acts are un
appreciated and become indifferent
You can read it in their looks and the
way they go about their tasks; you can
even read it in  the way they carry
themselves^ You find this lack of en
couragement in the homes as well as in
places of business and in the school
room A child who is held up to his
schoolmates as being dull, listless and
backward in his studies soon begins to
think the teacher is right and that he is
not as bright as the other children and
ceases to make any great effort to ad
vance He feels that the tide is against
him and there is no need to pull against
so strong a current, so he just drifts
along, and if he is promoted he consid
ers that it is just luck and through no
ability of his own These discouraged
boys are usually the ones who will be
found on the truant list They would
rather play "hookey" any day and go
fishing than to stay in the school-room
and dread what may come next They
are sensitive in spite of their indifferent
actions and dread having the finger of
scorn pointed at them or the words of
condemnation quite as much as they
would wearing the "dunce's cap,"
which was formerly so popular a pun
ishment in the school-rooms Encour
age that child for a few days and note
the difference Speak words of praise,
even if you have to draw on your imag
ination to do it and note the result I
Nine times out of ten it will pay A
great wave of happiness will sweep
over that  scholar and he will begin to
think he is not half so stupid or dull as
they had pictured him to be Then he
begins to think that he will show them
a thing or two, and before the school re
alizes it, the boy has waked up, and all
the scholarly aspirations that had lain
-dormant for so long suddenly spring
into new life, and the boy bends all of
his energies to get his lessons, send in a
good deportment and stand at the head
of his class  He has ceased hi^boyish
pranks and the bitter little pangs that
used to cause him so many heartaches
and made him appear sullen, disagree
able and indifferent, have disappeared
through the magic of the words of en
couragement, and there is a new light
in his life that illuminates all the little
dark places and makes him anxious to
please
Polly 'saw an instance of this in her
own school-life A boy, whom I shall
call Jack for convenience, was to begin
with full of boyish pranks and capers
and one of those natures that all the
chastisement in the world would not
subdue but only tend to harden him
Yet none of his teachers seemed to read
his nature; When he first started in
he was a fine-looking, manly little fel
low with a frank, open countenance,
but he hadn't been in the school-room
a week until his buoyancy of spirit got
him into trouble He played an inno
cent prank' on a schoolmate, and the
teacher not only held him up to the
ridicule of the rest of the scholars but '
punished ; them severely before them
It started the ruination of the boy She
could have appealed to his manly na
ture by a little quiet talk after the rest
had gone, but she was blind to that
fact, and her manner of dealing with
him raised a demon in his heart and he
felt his disgrace keenly He fairly
hated his teacher, and from that day
on never had Personal a perfect lesson He
would not study, and watched every
opportunity to create all the mischief he
could, and whether he was guilty or
not, he was credited with being the in
stigator of all the quarrels and troubles
both in and out of the school-room He
had the name of being the worst boy in
school, and as he progressed from room
to room his record followed him and
the new teacher was prepared and
expected to find Jack a positive terror
He was kept  in after school, and dur
ing his recesses he was punished by the
principal when his teacher found she
could not bring tears to the stubborn
boy's eyes
But finally there was a new era for
the boy A teacher from abroad was
appointed to fill a vacancy in the school
room She, too, had been prepared, for
a record of -Jack had been given her
and she was told to nip all trouble with
him in the bud by punishing him se
verely the first day and let him know
she was mistress of the school-room
She studied Jack the first day and
found the keynote to  all the trouble
It must be confessed that Jack was
enough to try the patience of a saint
that first day, for he seemed to be try
ing to establish his record with the
new teacher as the terror of the school
room She paid no attention to his
pranks, but when school closed she re
quested him to remain He expected
the usual punishment, but to his as
tonishment she put her arms around
him and drew him up to her side and
had a long, quiet talk with him She
told him that as he was one of the larg
est boys in the school-room she would
expect much of him, aud that he must
set a good example to the others, and
that as she would frequently be called
from the school-room she would ap
point him monitor and would expect
him to keep good order' She also told
him that she knew he was very bright
and that he could stand at the head of
his class if he would, and she knew she
would be very proud of him From
that moment Jack was her slave  He
would have studied all night rather
than disappoint her, and from that day
on there was not a more perfect little
gentleman in the school-room Personal''\Vhat
have you done to that boy to create
such a model scholar out of a holy
terror?" asked the principal one day
"I showed him that I loved and trusted
him,' and where others condemn j*f him
I encouraged him The boy wasstarv
ing for  encouragement and words of
praise There is no secret in knowing
how to manage the little fellow," -was
her reply That boy is to-day a promi
nent ' and successful business mail ' in
San Francisco, and he says he lays all
his success in life to the teacher who
trusted and encouraged and gave Wni
the words of praise that his former
teachers had denied him
- We need encouragement m the home,
in business circles, and in fact in all
the walks of life, and it is a dreary old
world without itPersonal Encouragement acts
like a good tonic and infuses new life
into one that is positively exhilerating
BRIEF REVIEW
Cost of Becoming a Doctor
According to the British Medical
Journal, the cost to qualify for a doctor
is between JE7OO and £1200 The calcu
lation works out as followsPersonal Most of
the London hospital schools arrange
that by paying a composition fee of
from a little over £100 to £150, either in
one sum or by installments, the student
becomes a perpetual student and is en
titled to attend all necessary lectures
and hospitals for the double diploma
As cheapness here cannot be considered
a special recommendation, we take the
larger sum for the purpose of our esti
mate, and, adding to it the necessary
expenses for maintenance, clothing,
books, anatomical parts, etc, at £100 a
year for five years — a rather low esti
mate for London — we find that the
total cost of an ordinary student at a
London hospital who qualifies at the
Conjoint Board would be from £650 to
£700; that of a university graduate
would necessarily be greater and might
amount to £1000 Of course there is
always the possibility in either case
that rejections at intermediate examin
ations may prolong the period of stu
dentship by an additional six mouths
or a year, or may even render coaching
necessary, and so add to the cost Not
the most frugal could find much to
cavil at on the score of extravagance
The main interest of the question, how
ever, centers in the possibility, not to
say probability, of paterfamilias having
half a dozen sons, all wishing to em
brace a liberal profession ' •
Puttees Causes Paralysis
In soldiers invalided home from the
Boer war a new disease has been dis
covered, to which the doctors have
given the name of "puttee paralysis"
Instead of wearing leggius in South
Africa many officers and soldiers wore
strips of cloth called "puttees" wound
around the lower leg These, being
bound tight, seem in some cases to have
pressed upon certain nerves, aud when
the men became weak from fever a
paralysis of the feet and toes resulted
At first the disease was called "enteric
feet," as it generally appeared in men
who were recovering from enteric or
typhoid fever Upon investigation,
however, it was found that the primary
cause of the disease was the puttee, so
it became "puttee paralysis" The
long marches, the tense movements of
the legs, especially when infantry sol
diers were mounted, and the uneven
pressure of the puttee caused such a
condition of things that the disease
could easily be accounted for Here
after leggins will probably never be
abandoned for puttees ,
Nails on the Human Hand
An exhaustive study of the nails of
the hand has been made by P A Min
ukorf, and some of the results appear to
be of medico-legal importance Among
other things he asserts that the nails of
the right hand in a right-handed person
are wider by two millimeters than the
corresponding nails on the left hand;
while in a left-handed person, the re
verse obtains, and in the ambidextrous
the nails are of equal size on the two
hands The thickness of the nails di
minishes progressively from the thumb
to the little finger
Protit in Making Pennies
 Pennies do not consist in copper alone,
there being in them 2 per cent of tin
and 3 per cent of zinc to 95 of copper
They cost the Government about 42
cents a pound exclusive of stamping,
and there are 148 in a pound, so the
Government makes a fair profit on
every pound minted, since, while they
are redeemable in gold, but few are ever
presented
One pound of coal will evaporate ten
pounds of water at 212 degrees atmos
pheric pressure, while one pound of oil
will evaporate sixteen pounds of water
under the same conditions
A British heat unit is the amount of
heat necessary to raise one pound of
pure water at 39 degrees one degree
A barrel of oil is the equivalent of
4,666,600, and a ton of coal of 19,307,000
British heat units
The number of suicides in France the
past five years exceeded 27,000
Statistics show that 24,000 people set
tled in Canada in the last six months

By the sole efforts of Assemblyman Fred L Stewart of
this District, Senator Lardner's bill to pay August Zimmer
mann $5,000 as compensation for false imprisonment was
killed in the House last Monday afternoon Stewart made a
vigorous speech in the Assembly and the bill was defeated
by a vote of 56 to 12
•This circumstance recalls the tragedy enacted in this

Fifteen years ago Henry Kutchenthal was found mur

mermann was arrested by Sheriff Murray of this county,
charged with the murder, tried, convicted and sentenced to
Folsom for life There were no eye witnesses to the murder
and the only testimony against the prisoner was that of Ed
ward Neff, who turned State's evidence Eleven years after
ward Neff, on his death bed, confessed that he swore falsely
at the Zimmermann trial, and Zinimermann was pardoned
by Governor Markham  Silas Penry was District Attorney
at the time and John A Eagon defended
Senator Lardner of Placer county, where Zimmermann
now lives, had a bill passed in the Senate to pay Zimmer

SENATOR DA VIS POINTS A MORAL
Senator Davis, whose generalship in the management of
the China Basin lease ratification bill carried it to victory in
the Senate, had this to say of the hard and well won fightPersonal
"This splendid victory of the Senate has proved a prin
cipal for which I have always contended; that any railroad
company can obtain just consideration of its rights without
going into politics It need have no bureau of political
henchmen, and need not be afraid of the Legislature if it will
keep its hands off party organizations, whether Republican
or Democratic The conservative men of all parties can be
trusted to have the courage to treat corporations fairly and
there need be no fear but they will rise to the occasion when
large measures are laid before them simply on their merits

William McKinley was inaugurated President of the
United States last Monday with the brief and time-honored
ceremony that for one hundred years has stood in striking
contrast to the pomp and circumstance marking the accession
ol emperors and kings From the moment that the Presi
dent stepped from the White House, at 10Personal30 o'clock last
Monday morning, to make his way to the Capitol, until his
retirement after the last column had swung past the little
reviewing stand where he stood, his ears were assailed by the
acclaim of his countrymen who were assembled to do honor
to the second inaugural of a wise ruler, a great statesman
and a man possessed of superb and extraordinary executive
ability The ceremonies were brilliant, and the weather was
fairly propitious We are now morally certain of at least
four years more of protection and prosperity
The meeting of our citizens, which has been called for
Thursday evening, March 14, by the Committee of Arrange

ly presented by speakers who will be there for that purpose
The Court room should be well filled by representative citi
zens and harmony should prevail throughout the meeting
That which is to the best public interest of one citizen is cer
tainly to the best interest of another Let us meet and talk
and "smoke the pipe of peace" over this important question
President McKinley lets well enough alone and re
tains his old and true Cabinet Last Tuesday he sent to the
Senate the names of John Hay, Lyman T Gage, Elihu Root,
John W Griggs, Charles Emory Smith, John D Long, E
A Hitchcock and James Wilson The people have confi
dence in this strong Cabinet and are pleased that no changes
are to be made A new member in the Cabinet, with a new
policy, would more or less unsettle things It is best as it
is The President is always right If Secretary Gage should
resign by and by, as he desires to do, the President may be
relied upon to fill his place with the right man

Mining Notes
CALAVERAS COUNTY-
ProspectPersonal The old Ilex mine at Rich
Gulch is being reopened,  after a state
of desuetude of thirteen yeaus At one
time this was a promising proposition
and thousands of dollars' were spent in
top improvements A fine mill was
erected, large boarding house and
other necessaries of a big mine, but,
then the money was gone, and but little
real development was done J O
Stewart, a paactical mining man of
wide experience, has now takon hold of
the mine and will give it a thorough
test  
Jos McClay, who has just completed
taking down the Union quartz mill
near Binum's, has gone to the mine
near San Domingo, where he will at
once commence active ' operations
Some sixteen or eighteen men will be
put to work at once, getting ready for
the erection of the mill 'The mine has
been well opened by tunnels and drifts,
so that a large body of ore is all ready
for taking out and milling Consider
able work remains to be done in grad
ing and cleaning uut the ditch for water
to operate the machinery As soon as
the roads settle the mill will be hauled
to the ground and put up The ore
has been thoroughly tested by mill
process and will doubtless render rich
returns*
From Jenny Land CorrespondentPersonal
The Vance and Mobley brothers of
Jenny Lind are putting houses and im
provements on their claims near Bear
gulch, and propose to sink there somo
300 feet They feel confident of uncov
ering at that depth a mammoth vein,
as in the 90 feet now sunk, the ledge
widening out from a few feet at the
surface to ten feet The rock is of vari
egated lines, with green, blue and yel
low carbonates, grey sulphides aud
chlorides and some free gold and sul
phurets It is a fine milling ore, much
like the Beckley, some two miles to the
south on the same lode The owners,
who are experienced miners, farmers
and mechanics, have a property that
with capital and hard work may de
velop into a mine of great value
In the Hoover and Voight mine, also
Bear Gulch, a good body of rich, ore
was found at a depth of 40 feet
The Golden Eagle mine of Dolan and
Eproson, has been bonded to Angels
parties, who desire to sink and drift to
the east in search of another valuable
ore body The surface indications are
that a rich deposit lies in this direction
This claim pans out considerable free
gold
Adjoining the Lost Log and Beckley
mines is the Tilford ranch lying on the
south This is all mineral land, with
numerous quartz veins all showing gold
In this vicinity is a great crook or
elbow in the country rock, which indi
cates bodies of ore beneath the surface,
which diligent search and intelligent
prospecting might bring to light Tho
owner has, by superficial work, found
plenty of ore which only needs crushing
to pay a handsome dividend
TUOLUMNE COUNTY
New EraPersonal A number of men were
laid off at the Dead Horse last night
There is considerable speculation as to

ever It is unquestionably a very fine
property'

For the year ending Jnne 30, 1899,*
the steam railroads of the United States
employed 928,924 persons, or about one
eightieth of tho then population That
is a statistical fact of ponderosity, but
it does not rise to the level ol this,
namely, that during the same year the
roads moved 14,59) 000,000 passengers
and 123,667,000,000 tons of freight a
distance of one mile  Divide thu sum
of these two sets ot figures, by the
number of employes, and we find the
share of work done by each was equiv
alent to moving 15,708 passengers one
mile and 133,130 tons of freisrht one
mile, or the movement by each em
ploye of one passenger and 85 tons of
freight forty-three miles each day of
tho year Talk of the expressiveness
of statistics — is there a better example
of it than that? Such is the aid that
machinery has been to man Such is
the result of labor-saving and time
eliminaMng devices in one direction
alone Look backward fifty years and
consider what was the ability of ono
man when he used horse-power as a
means to movement of passengers and
freight compared with the capacity a
railway gives him now, and reflect

Extra strain needs extra * strength
When a man begins to add to his hours
of labor, and subtract from his hours
of rest, he is putting an extra strain on
brain and body In such cases many
men make the serious mistake of using
stimulating liquors, or alcoholic medi-
cines These can only injure The spur
forces on the horse, but does not
strengthen him Stimulants are only
| spurs The need of the body u
strength Dr Pierce's Golden Medical
I Discovery is invaluable to overworked
men and women It strengthens  the
stomach, increases the - blood - supply,
nourishes the nerves, and gives vital
power to brain and body
There is no alcohol in " Golden Med-
ical Discovery" ' It contains no opium, '
cocaine or other narcotic It is strictly
a temperance medicine
Mr Edward Jacob*, of Marengo, Crawford Co,
Indiana, writesPersonal " After three Tain of suffering
with liver trouble and malaria I gave up all
hopes of ever getting (tout again, and Vie last
chance was to try your medicine I had tried
all the home doctors and received but little re-
lief After taking three bottles of Dr Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery and one vial of his
' Pleasant Pellets ' I am stout and hearty It is
due entirely to your wonderful medicines"

tend to the rollers and shaft track, fell
to his death in tbe South Eureka mine

the foreman, Wm Pollard, who was
in a drift some 100 feet They came

down to the 1800 level About fifty
feet below this a large door is placed
over the shaft to protect, the men at
work in the shaft below On this door
the body of Roberts was found  '

compartment atthe3oo-level, and hear
ing the skip coming had stepped on to
the center brace, His foot slipped and
he fell headlong down the north com
partment a distance of 1550 feet The
incline of the shaft at the 300-level is
62 degrees 'The clothes of the' de
ceased were torn from his body His
boots were found at the 500 level and
tbe last pieces of clothing were picked
up at the 1200 The body was so
mangled that recognition was im
possible Upon examination not an un
broken bone could be found
The jury consisting of L) Katz, M B

Calkins' Bros Good Work
From a recent editorial in tbe San
Francisco Call concerning the coming
Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo,
New York, we clip the following para
graph concerning the importance of
advertising among the counties of this
StatePersonal
The counties should wake up In a
few months the State is going to be on
view at the Buffalo exposition in the
most attractive and effective form of
display There will be vast crowds of
people there who will want to know in
what kind of land figs, grapes, oranges,
pomogranites, peaches, prunes, wheat,
corn, oats and barley all grow together
and at what price it may be had
Calkins Bros, of the Pacific Coast
Miner, have appreciated all this and
much more, and to let hundreds of
thousands Interested in California know
these and many more things reliably,
and especially the greatness and oppor
tunities of tho mineral resources and
mining industry of California, is to be
the mibsion of the forthcoming great
Pan-American exposition issue of this
journal In the teeming pages of this
splendid special number the raining
counties will be more effectively adver
tised than through any other single
agency
Teachers' Institute
Berkeley, California," Feb^-28
'My dear Mr GordonPersonal '' -' ''•"' ">*;;
In accordance with directions
in your letter of February 23, I have
begun making definite arrangements
for the Amador County institute, to be
held in Berkeley, April 2, to 4 inclusive
I have secured Stiles Hall as the place
of meeting, (at an expense of fifteen dol
lars for the whole time) Stiles Hall is
a building erected as a meeting place
for various student organizations It
stands directly across the street from
one of the main entrances to the Uni
versity grounds, and is a particularly
pleasant place of meeting It is con
trolled by a special board of trustees
and not by the Board of Regents
(The amount which tbe trustees charge
us for rental is is low as they ever
charge for any similar uses)
• President Wheeler has agreed, very
readily, to give the address of welcome
I have secured Professor Dresslar and
Mr T L Heaton, of the department
of Education, to lecture before the in
stitute According to present plans,
Professor Dresslar will give three talks
on the teaching of arithmetic, and Mr
Heaton three talks on the" teaching of
reading and language
I have found it easier to arrange for
visiting schools the whole of Wednes
day, than the way I first proposed So
we shall have lectures Tuesday, school
visitation Wednesday, and lectures
again Thursday
Supt J W McClymonds, of the
Oakland city schools, gives us a very
hearty invitation to visit schools in
Oakland Wednesday He says he will
himself devote the day to us We
shall visit some of his best schools
Every one I speak to about the plan
is very much interested in it and very
willing to help I am hoping to be
able to arrange for some interesting
evening sessions
I will let you know when the addi
tional arrangements are completed
And I will see whether we can have
one talk on the making of daily pro
grams, as you suggest in your letter of
the 23d The programs and photo
graph which you sent have been duly
received • Very truly yours,
Elmer E Brown

The Ledger has decided to place a
representative in the field for the pur
pose of gathering news for publication,
soliciting new business and adjusting
old outstanding accounts Mr John
H Moon, who has been in the employ
of this company for nearly three years,
has been selected to ' perform this diffi
cult work and any courtesy extended
to him will be thoroughly appreciated
and heartily reciprocated by the Led
ger Mr Moon is a young man, but
he has shown himself competent to fill
the positipn and wo have given it to
him He will call on delinquent sub
scribers, and we take this opportunity
to inform them in advance so that they
may be prepared to meet the bill when
presented by him Mr Moon will from
time to time visit the various mines of
the county, and we trust the Superin
tendents w}ll favpr the Ledger by
giving him such information relative
to their respective mines as they care
to have published, and that he will be
courteously received wherever he calls
No Eoad legislation
Pomona TimesPersonal This is the word from
Sacramento Tho cause is apparent
Too many localities want the initial
work or a lot of work The State's
size is a great obstacle tq road work
and causes useless expenditures in other
directions, Every locality of conse
quences from San Diego to Shasta, a
distance of about 700 miles, wants a
normal school, a school of technology,
an asylum, a penitentiary or home of
some kind, and too many get them
Road legislation has met defeat at this
session because of lpcality demands It
looks as if a State system would never
be inaugurated Say what sentimen
talists may, the State is tod large to
insure a well considered and executed
plan of public improvements We know
it is sort pf pplitioal ppd partisan here
sy to suggest State division, but State
division would remedy several difficul
ties in the way of systematic and effi
cient improvement without N moving a
mountain, changing a river or other
thing on land or sea, and the country
from San Diego to Oregqn be benefited
Instantly Killed
Last Saturday Amado Massa and
another gentleman were driving on
North Main street, and turned out and
stopped their horse just in front of the
Kelly residence to wait for Kid Best and
another gentleman, who were driving
rapidly toward them, to pass On they
came at a rattling pace, but Mr Best
did not clear Massa's horse, one shaft
of his cart piercing Us breast, causing
instant death, We understand that
Mr Best has paid Massa for the horse
We desire to again warn drivers to
make less speed on the main streets of
town, and especially when in the vicini
ty of Ginocchio's corner Unless this
warning is heeded some person will be
dangerously hurt if not killed outright
Time and again we have seen
pedestrians escape being knocked down
and trampled upon, by a mere hair's
breadth Let fast driving on Main
street cease

Study Best Interests of Party
An application for the janitorship of
the Court House was presented to the
Supervisors at tbe last meeting, but
the board declared that no vacancy ex
isted and therefore refused to consider
the application This janitorship
question is causing no end of criticism
on the part of many Republicans who
believe that ( 'to the victor belongs the
sppils " It is a small matter, but small
things sonietimes kick up a deal of a
row Qiir Republican Supervisors
should handle this case in a manner
that will redound to the best interests
of the party in the Ipng run, every
other consideration to the contrary
notwithstanding
Finger Crashed
Last Saturday at Lathrpp, A F-
Stark of this place met with a rather
painful Occident' He was standing in
the car door as the train was slowing
up for the station, with his right hand
resting 1 near the hinge of tho open dpor
The sudden stop clqsed the door and
caught bis little finger, breaking the
bQne and bruising the flesh consider
ably A fellow passenger by his side
caught the dqor in time to break its
full force or the finger would have been
severed from the hand The writer
hereof was on the northbound train,
and having arnica in his grip, tho
injured finger was bathed and bandaged
and Mr Stark proceeded cityward

AUKUM
Aukum, Mar 6, 1901— Death has
occurred among two of our life long
frieeds in the past week On Satur
day morning last, Columbus C Forbes
was found dead in his bed, heart failure
being the cause
Mr Forbes came to this State in the
year 1852 He mined on Weaver Creek
in El Dorado county, with the late
Hon M M Estee He was also per
sonally acquainted with the late Ex-
Governor Stanford and traded with
him when he kept his little store in the
early fifties at Diamond Springs 
He crossed tbe plains with an ox
team and one who came across with
him saidPersonal "Columbus Forbes was a
brave man and a congenial companion "
He had no enemies and it could be
truthfully said of him that he was an
honest man which the imperishable
maxim marks as the "noblest work of
God" He leaves a wife, six daughters
and three sons and a host of grand
children to mourn his loss ' V 
On Monday at 2 o'clock, at San Fran
cisco, Mrs Ella Jameson died, ' where
she went to have a surgical operation
for cancer of the stomach performed
She was in very feeble health when
she leftand her death did not come un
expected She was a woman univers
ally liked, a christain woman, a devot
ed mother All that knew her knew
her to love, for no venom escaped her
lips to mark, mar or pain any in their
action of life No human tongue lisped
ill will against her  She was tho
daughter of James E Bates, now of
the State of Washihgton She was
the wife of Robert  Jameson well and
favorably known in this locality She
leaves one brother now of Hepner,
Oregon, and two uncles, Sam Bates of
Washington, and Walter Bates of Sac-,
ramento, two sons and one daughter
and her bereaved husband to mourn
her untimely end  NOME
Equal To The Emergency
A B Summers, the well-known
Plymouth surveyor, accompanied by
his wife, had a mud-hole experience
recently which both will remember for
some time They were in a two-wheeled
vehicle on their way home when a
loaded team blocked their way Mr
Summers attempted to drive around
the other outfit and bis horse plunged
into a mud hole almost shoulder deep
The animal's frantic efiorts to get out
was too great a strain on the harness
and Mr and Mrs Summers and the
cart were left in the pit, the horse hav
ing walked < through the- harness
There was only one way out, namely
wade out, and this Mr Summers pro
coeded to do carrjing his wife, dry
shod, to a friendly bank The cart
was then pried out, the harness patched
up, and the wayfarers proceeded home
ward without further mishap
Good Kesults
Rev J B Orr of San Francisco, the
talented young preacher who has been
assisting Rev F A Morrow in revival
work here for several weeks,  departed
for Mokelumne Hill on Thursday where
lie will continue the work to which his
life is dedicated Rev Orr presents
the truth in an interesting and forcible
manner and holds his audiences with  a
master hand He is evidently a dili
gent student and can effectually use
and impart the biblical lore stored up
In his student days Our church goers
are delighted with Rev Orr's methods
and all unite in God speed in his great
work- The names of thirty-five per
sons were added to the church roll
during the meetings
What Should Be Done
Stockton IndependentPersonal If the report
of the Special '-Lexow" Committee is
to be accepted as true, there should be
some direct method of punishment for
the parties responsible for the condi
tions The power of impeachment is
restricted to certain Slate officers, but
there should be as summary a way of
dealing with a Mayor and Police Com
mission that conspire to violate State
laws  The most valuable part of the
lesson being taught by Mrs Nation in
Kansas is to enforce the laws If there
is open violation, and the Mayor will
not act, then the Legislature should
have the privilege of using the hatchet
A few political heads reduced to intoli
gibility for political honors would stop
slavery and lottery gambling in China
town in about' six minutes There
should bo an impeachment hatchet
lodged somewhere for such emergen

Certain Death Beneath Him
During, the last heavy rains here
abouts, which caused many creeks and
foot-hill ravines to become roaring
cataracts, Mr Richard Webb of this
place had a thrilUng experience and
came very near going to tho great be
yond from whonco  no one returns
The episode in brief is as followsPersonal Mr
Webb has for weeks been superintend
ing the construction of his new hotel at
Pino Grove, and, being an active and
energetic  person, frequently walked
home the distance being only nine
miles On the day of the adventure he
intended to return by stage, but the
vehicle was overcrowded and he de
cided to walk home It was raining
when he started and the storm in
creased as he proceeded All went
fairly well, however, until he found
himself brought to a stand still by an
impassablo mountain torrent which
went thundering- across his pathway,
wasting power enough to operate a
dozen quartz mills The rain-soaked
traveler gazed in astonishment at the
torrent which a few hours before was a
harmless brooklet, but his dogged de
termination was only balked for a
moment, and he decided to cross that
roaring gulch in some way or another
in spite of h— and high water He
proceedod up the bank of the stream
for a long distance searching for a
narrow place whore he could, by the
aid of the overhanging branches of an
adjacent tree, swing himself safely to
the other side At length ho found the
desired spot and firmly grasping a
branch of the tree made the leap, but
alas, he fell short and his weight lower

touched the water To lot go his hold

length of time was a physical impossi

the very jaws of death, for several
minutes He realized that an almost
superhuman effort must be made to
extricate himself from the dangerous
predicament He was equal to the oc

bush on tho opposite bank and finally
gained terra firma When he reached

well nigh exhausted
Oil For Fuel
Alterations are making in several
mining plants hereabouts preparatory
to substituting oil for, wood and coal
The Kennedy management ' has V S
Garbarlni in the city selecting what is
needed to put that plant on an oil
burning basis, and the Oueida and
South Eureka mines will swing into
line also Tho mills of each of the
above mines are to be run by electricity
This change from wood to oil, as we
understand the matter, is not because
oil is so much cheaper than wood, but
because wood is becoming very  scarce

A New Census Word
A new word seems destined to eornt
into use with the census of 1900 The
word ' is "median" It ought to dis
place average and center for the great
er number of ordinary census uses,
since the ' notion of "average" which
most people have is really expressed
by ''median," while "average" means
quite another thing There is room in
our terminology for both terms, just
as we distinguish between plurality
and majority to good advantage In
discussing election returns The av
erage age of the population of the Unit
ed States, for example, Is 25 years;
the median age is 21 years The latter
means the point at which there are as
many people above as below An 80
year-old man would then have no more
Influence In pulling up the median age
of his community than a 40-year-old
man so long as both were above the
average The octogenarian would,
however, have a great influence on the
average age of a community— Boston

DANGER IN THE BOOK
WHY ONE MAN DREADED THE COM
ING INTO CAMP OF A DICTIONARY-
Be'Dlacreetl? Left Before the Vocif
erously Applauded Sentiments He
Expressed In His Speech Could Be
Analysed a la Webster
When the son of the president of the
Big Mountain Lumber, company came
Jo the mountains to learn the busi
ness, so to speak, ' l- knew within 15
minutes that he had come to the
wrong place He was a city chap, new
ly graduated and thoroughly out of
touch with everything mountainous
He was a bright fellow, however, and
amply capable, only the mountains
were not the field for his development
As time elapsed his distaste grew, and
it was all be could do not to express
his opinion  of the mountain people,
their manners, customs, homes, morals
and everything connected with them
He was wise enough to confide in me
alone and bided tils time to get away
to some more congenial clime And
he got away sooner than he expected
It happened that there was a public
meeting one night at the sawmill shed,
and he was called on to make a few
remarks Every other man at the
meeting except myself, who acted as
chairman, was of the mountains, and
their illiterate talk had roused the
young college fellow to the limit He
saw a chance to get even, in bis own
mind at least, and when the call came
for him he responded promptly • His
speech, quite brief, but to the point,
was as follows, copied from his own
manuscript, even the [applause] partPersonal
"My friends, I am glad to meet you
on this occasion, for I have wished to
say to you publicly what I think of
you, though our acquaintance has not
been long Coming as a stranger
among you, I was only partly prepared
for what was In store Now, let me
say to you that half has not been told
me [Applause] In the internecine
arena your lethiferous conduct has
artounded me by the trucidation and
occision characterizing It among no
men I have ever known [Loud ap
plause] In the diversified field of
mendacity your efforts would make
Machiavelll take to the tall timber
[Uproarious applause] In all fura
clous, raptorial and predacious pur
suits you have done such wonders
that the gifted and great Jonathan
Wild would have felt his latrociny
was a sounding brass and bis dlreption
a tinkling cymbal [Great applause]
In the broad expanse of labor your
torpescent oscitation has made you
sul generis among all pandlculate man
kind [Cheers and shouts of "Good for
us!"] As good livers, your tables
groan beneath their stercoraceous and
Impetiginous burden, and as drinkers,
your temulent bibacity has made the
crapulous reputation of Bacchus to be
a sign of puritanical abstemiousness
[Loud applause] As for yourselves, I
take pleasure in saying here to you,
without fear of successful contradic
tion, that your nugaclty Is forever
establishedPersonal as observers of the law,
your aberrance Is teratological and
personally you are a cohesive concat
enation of rnbigant exuviae, that I
take especial pleasure In believing does
not exist elsewhere on earth [Vocif
erous applause]"
When the enthusiasm had cooled
down somewhat, he proceeded to speak
on the subjects before tup meeting and
sat down The mountaineers were
pleased to death with the college man's
high flown speech about them, and
though I didn't know the meaning of
all the big words he used I did 'know
that he bad been calling them liars and
murderers and thieves and scoundrels
and drones and lawless drunkards, be
sides condemning their fare and anath
ematizing the lot of them personally
But not one of them suspected, and I
was hoping nothing -would come of it
and they would forget, even if any of
the large words, were remembered,
when one day a book agent drove up
to the office in a buckboard and an
nounced that he was selling Webster's
Unabridged Dictionary for $2 a copy
and showed a sample that was as big
as a box of soap
Nobody bad ever seen so much book
for i lie money, nor bad anybody ever
seen a dictionary in that neighborhood,
aud wlieu the agent began to tell what,
a valuable thing It was to be In every
family the men became interested, and
it wasn't long until the agent had sold
25 copies, to be delivered the following
week When he had gone away with
his sample I called the young man
into the private ottice for consultation
"Don't say a word," he began as
soon as be bad closed the door "I
know exactly where 1 am at, and
I'll be some place else before Mr Web
ster arrives to throw any light on my
recent remarks I am not shedding
any tears, and in order that the dic
tionary buyers and others may know
jus*, wbat 1 think of them I shall leave
two dozen copies of ray speech for dis
tribution on the morning of my de
parture"

JEWEL MALADIES
Precious Stone* That Are Subject to
Serious Changes
The decoloration of precious stones
when they have been exposed to the
air for a long time Is considered one it
the most frequent maladies Among
the colored stones, the emeralds, rubles
and sapphires are those which remain
intact best Nevertheless they are not
exempt frcti changes, as ' has been
proved by many experiments recently
Jade In Paris Two rubles of the same
size and shade were kept for two years,
one In a showcase and the other away
from all light At the end of this term
a comparison revealed that the first
had become somewhat lighter In color
The Influence of light makes itself
felt more plainly on topazes and gar
nets Tbe garnet turns much paler In
a short time, while the topaz assumes
a darker shade and even loses the bril
liancy possessed by It when freshly
cut
The most sensitive stone In this re
spect is the opal This stone draws Its
marvelous rainbow reflections from
numerous little clefts which allow the
light to pass and reflect It In different
directions Often the opal stands the
manipulations of cutting and polishing
well, and all of a sudden it splits It
suffers always by excess of heat Ow
ing to its chemical composition It Is
sensitive to all the changes of tempera
ture
 Pearls deteriorate very easily In the
fire they are transformed into a piece
of lime Placed In contact with an acid,
they behave as lime or marble would
under the same conditions It some
times happens that during the work If
the hand touching them Is very sweaty,
they lose their luster or break, being
attacked by the acid of the perspira
tlon
Since pearls are composed of concen
tric layers of mother of pearl, it is
sometimes possible to repair them by
taking off the outer layer, but this
operation Is extremely difficult and
delicate If the Interior colors are In

[Copyright, 1900, by C B Ltwii]
Major Crofoot grand promoter and
general originator, was just making
ready to go out after a luxurious 15
cent lunch when there came a timid
knock on the door -It couldn't be the
agent of the building after the four
months' back rent, for he would have
boldly knocked the door open; his land
lady, to ' whom he owed $48,  didn't
know where his office was; the tailor
had grown discouraged, the coal man
always sent his bill In the forenoon,
and should It be a bill from the cob
bler he wou'-d dispute Its correctness
In answer to the major's "Come in!" a
young woman entered - --'
"I— l have called," she began, "in the
interest of a new industrial home soon
to be established lam soliciting per
sonal subscriptions" '
"My dear woman, sit down— sit right
down," cheerily replied the major "We
may call this a coincidence— a curious
coincidence Not half an hour ago I
began drawing up plans for just such
an institution It is to be called the
Crofoot Self Supporting Home"
"Then you would not want to sub
scribe to another,' of course?"
'•'Perhaps so You may give me what
particulars you can"
"It is to be a home where children
without parents and friendless old
folks can be provided for
"PLAIN AS DAY, MY DEAR YOUXG WOMAN"
for their board and clothes they will
do what work they can I believe they
will make brushes and brooms"
"Exactly; I see A noble idea, my
dear woman, a noble idea and a grand
charity, and you deserve credit for in
teresting yourself We cunnot have
too many of these Institutions, and I
personally feel that I cannot do too
much (or them You may put me down
for $10"
"That Is very nice of you," she said
as she wrote his name in her book "I
have taken 200 subscriptions, and yours
Is the most liberal of all"
-"I never do things by halves, miss
When I enter upon a charity, I do it
with my whole soul You may make
my subscription $15"
"How good of you!"
"And now about my own borne, the
one I have planned You will prob
ably be Interested in it I shall erect a
building to accommodate at least 250
Inmates It will not be an industrial
home in the usual use of the term Per
haps I shall change the name to 'The
Crofoot Utopian Power company' The
first Idea Is the care and comfort of
the unfortunate; the next to make
them feel that they are not dependent
upon charity"
"That Is good of you," observed tne
caller W* ~JZ •  Personal
"How best to do this was long a puz
zle to me, but I have solved it at last
When Major Crofoot starts in on an
Idea, he never lets It get away from
him unsolved There will be no manu
facturing in my home The Inmates
shall simply eat, sleep and walk about
Your countenance expresses surprise,
but let me add that each and every one
shall earn his keep"
"I— l can't see how"
"The simplest thing In the world In
the basement will be a 5,000 horsepow
er engine Pipes will lead to it from
every room That engine will be run
by what may be called lost power For
instance, you sneeze or cough There
la power there, but it is wasted You
fall off a chair; yon sing or whistle;
you yawn It takes power to do it,
but the power is wasted By a system
of pipes all this lost power will be con
ducted to the engine to run It No coal,
no gas, no wood Engine runs right
along day and night and has power
enough to supply all factories within
half a mile of it What the factories
paywill keep the home going Do you
understand?"
"What an Idea!" gasped the woman
' "Not a bad one," smiled the major as
he walked around, "and I am sole orig
inator All others will be imitations
'All I shall ask of the inmates is to take
comfort As they rock to and fro in
250 rocking chairs the engine Is work
ed up to its full capacity; as they move
across the floor, eat, sleep, quarrel or
make up they furnish me power Out
of 250 people 188 will snore In their
sleep These snores will give me a
pressure of 50 pounds on the engine"
"Wonderful! Wonderful!" she whis
pered
"If s just making use of natural phi
losophy It is not a stock company,
and there will be no dividends, but I
want outsiders interested I want 100
people to take shares of $17 each In or
der that they may help me run the
home and receive a share of the public
praise The superintendent alone will
receive a salary May I offer you the
position?"
"I don't believe I could take It Yon
see, I am only a volunteer canvasser"
"Exactly, but I am satisfied you
would make a good superintendent and
see that none of the power was wasted
I can say that the salary will be at
least $5,000 per year"
"It Is awfully kind of you, but I fear
I must decline"
"Then I will not press you I will,
however, put you down for a $17 share,
and whenever you are near the home
you are entitled to drop in and stir up
the Inmates The harder you stir them
the more power we get Have you $2
tandy, miss? If so, I will use it for
revenue stamps"
"I don't understand," she replied as
she rose up with a puzzled look
"Plain as day, my dear young woman
I subscribed $15 to the home you are
canvassing for I put you down for
$17 for a share in the Crofoot Utopia
Power company The difference be
tween $15 and $17 is $2 You had best
pay now and have it over with"
"But I don't see," she protested aa
her eyes grew big
"Then we will go over it again If
you add 2 to 15 it makes J7, doesn't It?
And you owe me just the difference
This being my busy day"—
She looked at him in a vacant way

FIRST PAGE FOR SPEECHES
Rivalry Among Congressmen For a
Good Position In The Record
The effort that is constantly being
made to secure the printing of speeches
on the front page of The Congressional
Record is f not generally understood
Senators and representatives naturally
desire to have their deliverances ' in
congress receive as much attention as
possible-, and there is but one publica
tion in which they can monopolize the
front page In a display of their
speeches That one publication is Tbe
RecordPersonal
Of, course speeches that are printed
in regular order in the debate, ap
pearing on the day after they are de
livered, are 10 be found only in their
regular place In The Record But in
the cases of speeches withheld for re
vision there is an opportunity to have
them displayed pn the first, page of the
official report of the proceedings This
is merely done by an arrangement be
tween the senate and bouse by which
this privilege Is about equally divided
Senators and  representatives who
withhold their remarks for revision
frequently inquire when they can have
the first page of The Record,' which Is
generally reserved for at least a week
ahead  
In return
Ihe general rule is "First come, first
served" In this way those who want
to make their speeches Influential will
at times arrange to have them on the
first page of The Record on the morn-
Ing of a day when a vote is to be
taken, in order that they may be
brought prominently to the attention
of their* fellow legislators just before
they are to take action on tbe matters
of which they treat It is In the na

The Cninese Cuisine
Though Chinese cuisine has been
credited with some utterly fabulous
dishes, such as white mice served
alive,  which add piquancy by their
squeak as they dive down the gullet,
curiosities in the edible line do form
a considerable list
 Bird's nest soup, for Instance; a
clear soup made from the refined
gluten with which a certain species
of swallow fasten their nests beneath
the rocks; stewed "sea slugs," another
nasty sounding dish, but transcending
in flavor the aldermanic green turtle
fat There may be, too, on first intro
duction, some prejudice against fried
grasshoppers But courage in this in
stance is rewarded by a deliciously
crisp, brown mouthful, of a delicate
nutty, flavor'   Personal
i It Is a fallacy to suppose that pork
forms a constant article of diet in
China As a matter of fact It is too
expensive and is only eaten on high
days and holidays or at -restaurants
Neither do milk, beef or game enter
much Into Chinese cookery, the first
two being tabooed on religious grounds
Dog flesh Is eaten In the south but
rarely and only by the poorest of the

the supply has run so short that now

so far as strength and durability are
concerned are superior to the ancient
designs, which were hand made, but

The Stars and Stripes at Acre
A good American had been making
some soul stirring remarks about- the
glorious star spangled banner when an
-Englishman who is pretty well Ameri
canized told a little story, aproposPersonal "I
remember once to have seen the stars
and stripes applauded uproariously on
a peculiar occasion It happened many
years ago when the British flag wasn't
as popular In the United States as It is
now and a party of us Englishmen
were at a theater in New York consid
erably ; farther down town than thea
ters are now to be found on Broadway
The play was 'Richard I,' and if you re
member there Is a scene in the play
where Richard, after putting his foes
to flight in terrific style, mounts the
walls of Acre and plants the British
colors there Evidently the manage
ment knew the temper of the audience
and felt that even under such circum
stances the British flag would not be a
good thing, so what did they do but
give Richard the star spangled banner,
and,' by all the gods, he took it with
him in the charge and planted it on
Acre's walls It was ridiculous, of
course, and we Englishmen laughed,
but the audience took it quite as the
correct thing, and the way the people
stormed and shouted and clapped was
enough to have made Richard turn
over in his grave Historically it was
away off, dramatically It was open to
criticism, but patriotically it was a
howling success"— Washington Star
Trigonometry In X Ray 'Work
"Few people know," said Dr J C
Egelston while performing an opera
tion at the City hospital, "that it takes
trigonometry to locate a bullet in the
body But In every X ray operation
In which the bullet or foreign sub
stance is deeply Imbedded a mathemat
ical computation is necessary to show
just how deep the bullet is The X
rays make the flesh transparent leav
ing only the bones and foreign sub
stance visible, so that you see just
where the bullet is, and yet you don't
know where It Is You know its lati
tude and longitude, so to speak, but
those measurements are surface meas
urements, and you don't known how
deep the object is beneath the surface
The point on the surface of the body
beneath which the bullet is can be
readily located, but how far beneath
that point is the bullet?
"This is the question that trigonome
try has to answer, and by knowing the
answer a great deal of unnecessary
cutting may be saved, and what might
otherwise be a difficult and dangerous
operation may be rendered compara
tively safe and easy If the bullet en
ters one side of the body, for Instance,
and lodges within an inch or two of
the skin on the other side, the other
side of the body would be the one from
which to operate"— Kansas City Jour
