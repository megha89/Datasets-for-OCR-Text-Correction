The Amador Ledger
Why an Alias T
One afternoon, when the uke of
Edinburgh and Sir Arthur Sulliau
haing finished a duet, were sitting
down to a homely "dish of tea" pro
ided by Mrs Sullian, the composer's
mother, it suddenly occurred to her to
start the subject of family names and
titles, which puzzled the good lady con
siderably
"Sir,", she said, "your family name Is
Guelph"
"My dear mother," began Arthur
"But it is, isn't it?" she persisted
"Certainly," replied the duke, much
amused "What's the matter with It
Mrs Sullian?" ~
"Oh, nothing," returned the excellent
old lady musingly "Only I can't un
derstand why you don't call yourself
by your proper name"  Personal  ; 
Arthur wanted' to explain to her, but
the duke would not allow him to
"There's nothing to be ashamed of in
the name of Guelph, Mrs Sullian" he
said graely
''That's exactly what I say," persist
ed \ Arthur's mother; | "nothing /what
eer as far as I know, and, that being
so, why you should not call yqurself by
It I can't understand"— F C Bur
nand's "Records and Reminiscences"
At the Opera
"Why do you insist on sitting near
the bass drum and cymbals at a grand
apera performance?"
"I don't mind telling you as an oKI
friend," answered Mr Cumrox "It's
the only way I can make sure of uot
disgracing mother and the girls by
staying asleep through the entire per
formance"—Washington Star

The Kiss
An American humorist once said that
"the only way to define a kiss Is to take
one" Olier Wendell Holmes called a
kiss the twentyseenth letter of the
alphabet— "the loe labial which It
takes two to speak plainly"
It cannot be too often repeated,  "To
tinoate is not to reform"— Burke

Strengthen the lungs as you

The best lung fertilizer is

it isn't really consumption so
much the better; you will soon
forget it and be better for the

cured at once, but if you will

A Roman Meet
Rome has a delightful climate tbe
whole year round, and from the end
of Noember to the middle of March
is an ideal time for hunting Then the
hounds meet twice a week On such
mornings the riders leae Rome or the
illas roundabout in time to be on the
field and ready by 11 o'clock, for the
hunt' Is always seeral miles from
Rome, sometimes on the rolling, partly
timbered land to the northward, but
more often on the leel, plain Such a
meet is to Rome what a Aleadowbrook
meet Is to New York It means a
morning gathering of fashionables,
with time and money and distinction
to its credit Swift moing, motor cars,
lumbering ; drags and ; fourinhands,
smart phaetons, barouches, ictorias
and dogcarts hurry out from the city

there could be to forfeit his life for any

Expert Sandwich Cutters
"Men who cut sandwiches must hae
just as much knack and experience hi
the business as men who open oysters
on the rier boats" said a New York
man who on one occasion supplied 75,
000 sandwiches at two days' notice
"It took seen men to do that job in
the time allowed," he said, "and they
hadn't any time to spare at tliat I
paid them by the hundred, the man
who did the most work getting the
most pay When they were all through,
there weren't enough scraps of bread
and meat to fill a tin pail That is the
secret of cutting sandwiches— to aoid

The Spit Snake
There Is a snake belonging to the
small family causidse, inhabiting Afri
ca, that is said to hae the power of
ejecting its enom to a short distance
This snake is called by the utch
Boers "spuw slang," or spit, snake
When this snake erects its teeth the
pressure of the maxillary bone on the
gland causes the enom to flow in
drops, and it may be quite possible that
by discharging air from its mouth the
poison may be blown some distance •

A TIRELESS WORKER
The Marelous Energy That Was »
Part of Mnranlny
No life was eer lied at higher pres
sure than 1 that of Macaulay He was
not only "like a book in breeches," |as
Sydney Smith said of him; he was also
like an intellectual' steam engine' f His
thirst for knowledge was only ; equaled
by his amazing capacity for retaining
knowledge and by his passionate inter
est in all the aspects of life "I wish
I knew; as much of anything, as Ma
caulay knows of erryiliing," said Mel
bourne, and, though the epigram may
hae been intended as  a gibe It ap
proximated to the truth To the aer
age dullard of the world it must hae
seemed that this tempestuous man was
literally omniscient" He plunged into
Italian like a boy rejoicing in a new
toy; he took up Spanish with an appe
tite growing by what it fed on, and
then he returned to Greek with a Joy
which he found indescribable  ifc
amused himself in going to India  by
learning German and mitigated the dis
tress of a oyage across to Ireland by
committing "Paradise Lost" to mem
ory, claiming, doubtless with truth,
that if by any inconceiable mischance
the great epic were to be utterly de
stroyed he could from the tablets of his
memory gie it back to the i world—
London News
A Highland inner
"The highland dinner is a ery smart
affair, and one that is neer seen south
of the Tweed," says the London Queen
"The laird wears his full dress kilt e
ery night, and eery one with any
claim to a clan does the same, so that
often there are more kilted men around
the table than black coats
"The full kilt dress is splendid, and
a man to the manner born looks far
better in It than in any other clothes
It gies width, height and dignity to
the wearer, with its shayd/ sporran and
brooches Not only does the laird wear
his highland dress, but toward the end
of dinner his piper, who has played in
the hall outside during the meal, comes
into the room and marches around the
table The pipes are a little deafening,
but the player looks so fine that one is
glad to see him Most of the pipers In
the more noble families hae inherited
the position from their ancestors ' and
are rightly proud of the post After
dinner, if there is a big house party,
there is often a dance Then the piper
Is at his best, as he plays his pipes for
the lightsome reels to be danced, beat
Ing time with his foot the while"
The Value of Politenesi
If those who are doubtful as to the
correct course to pursue in any gien
situation will remember that een tbe
wrong tiling is oerlooked If one is but
absolutely polite in the doing of it their
relief might be great i
A gentleness of demeanor and a cour'
teous response or question enn neer be
out of place A man may wear a busi
ness suit of clothes to an eening wed
"ding" less noticeably than a truculent'
air of insolence If he be perfectly well
bred as far as behaior goes, it matters
not so much what his outward garb,
although by an uuwrltton law of social
obserance certain clothes are the cor
rect thing for certain occasions
•Politeness is neer wrong Its prac
tice goes nearly all the way toward the
goal of the right thing in the right
place We hear of polite insolence, but
insolence is neer polite, and it is neer
under any circumstances polite to be
Insolent" •" 
Clock Plant
The clock plant is a natie of Borneo,
and in that country een it is said to
be rare The plant deries its name
from its peculiar habits, which are
known to but few who hae not studied
It from a scientific standpoint The
plant has leaes of two sizes, one
of which acts in the capacity • of a
minute hand, which keeps moing un
til  o'clock in the afternoon, and the
other keeps going until morning The
larger leaes act as the hour hands!
Starting in a position when alltlio
leaes lie close to the stem, with the
points banging down, they rise gradu
ally until they turn toward the top,
and then they drop to their former po
sition It takes the smaller leaes
about one minute to go through this
performance and the longer leaes just
about an hour— Melbourne Times
A Bornean Weapon
The Bornean mandau, or "head tak

dah It is a heay, thick bladed cat
lass, from twenty to thirty inches loug,
and the edge is ground from the right
side only, the left side being forged
slightly concae^^ — The blade is also

A PLAGIARIST
The Sort of a Thief That Charles

, The noelists who aspire toward ab

once In awhile of , the sources from
which certain masters drew their In

which those great workers picked up
whateer would sere them at their
trade 'Personal Charles Reade depended on the
newspapers as the liing record of life
as it Is One day in the week he de

the result of his collating appeared in

Fiscalitla Is Old
Fiscalltls is a disease that flourished
hi England as far back as the four
teenth century, only the tax that was
then Imposed upon foreign goods was a
broken head to the maker of them  
When Wat Tyler's people entered
Southwark In 1371 their anger was so
great against the Flemish weaers and
other workers that they made the pro
nunciation of "bread and cheese" a test
of the honest home worker, and who
eer failed to pass it was deemed a
Fleming and put to death A century
later Cade's Kentlshmen had for one of
their cries, "The foreigners forestall
the market, and so Englishmen want
and stare I" •
About 1585 England was called the
Asylum Christi, so many were the for
eign weaers, brewers, silk workers
and jewelers who settled there, and a
popular saying In Henry VIII's reign,
"The French teach us how to make
hats and how to take them off," shows
the importance of foreign made goods
at that time— London Standard ,
The Old Time Pepper Mill
' A pepper mill is a piece of siler not
often seen on tables nowadays Eng
lish housekeepers, howeer, still use
the pepper mill, and American siler
smiths sometimes keep it to meet the
demands of old fashioned families who
prefer to grind their own pepper rather
than risk the chance of adulteration
The pepper mill dates back to the time
when pepper was a scarce commodity
and was always ground at the table
from the peppercorns Pepper was so
aluable In those days that rents were
often paid in peppercorns, and the high
prices they brought were among the
incenties that induced explorers to
brae the dangers of j the unknown
deep If a short passage could be dis
coered to the Indies, it was agreed by
all that" a wealth of pepper could be
easily brought to Europe ,
The Visible and Inisible
The wisest Indian philosophy has
neer boggled, like ours, oer that silly
word "supernatural" The Upanishad
Bays, "What is In the isible exists also
In the Inisible, and what Is In Brahrn'B
world Is also here" The ultimate, al
beit unreachable, Is as real to the Asi
atic mind as rice, and In the Bhagaad
GltaArJuna Is actually permitted to
behold the embodied infinite Indeed
it is rather this present existence which
India regards as the Illusion, the maya
To see the stars we must wait for
night, and to lie we must die Nor Is
it uninteresting to note In Hindoo clas
sics how these large and happy sereni
ties of oriental iew hae Softened per

Old and Good
Many young men fail in life because
they don't know a chance when tliey

when it Is too late These youngsters
who want to be masters oer the men

they owe the inspiration of their lies,

The Celtic Affirmatie
In the speech of so highly deeloped
a people as the Celts there Is no equia
lent to "yes" Thus It happens that
you shall neer hear an Irish waiter

Men In Petticoats
It will probably be a matter of sur
prise to the general reader to learn
that the petticoat was first worn ex
clusiely by men In the reign of King
Henry VII the dress of the English
was so fantastic and absurd that it was
difficult to distinguish one sex from the
other In the Inentory of Henry V
appears a "petticoat of red damask,
with open sleees" There is no men

Tudor period

The Successful Scheme ot a Theat
rical Press Agent
An agent who was hi despair owing
to his failure to get, any ; adertising
that had not been paid for found him
self in a big, western city with his at
traction playing to strong competition
and something | desperately j needed to
attract public attention to his show
In one scene of the play a pah? of hand
cuffs  figured The agent had an ln
Bplration He had the star snap a
handcuff on her wrist, and then the
agent concealed the key, saying It had
been lost The star was compelled to
finish the act wearing the handcuff
dangling from her wrist The audi
ence knew it should not be there, and
comment, was aroused Between' the
next two acts the agent droe the ac
tress swiftly to police headquarters,
near at hand The police captain was
mysteriously called out Ho was in
formed that the actress must hae the
handcuff remoed at once and secretly,
as she did not wish news of her pre
dicament to get out The chief brought
out a big bunch of keys, and finally the
handcuff was remoed, but not until
a dozen alert reporters had snuffed a
"story" and were plying the reluctant
press agent with questions Finally
the whole story was pumped out of the
agent, the star, haing returned', to fin
ish the play Next morning the first
page of eery local, paper had a fine
story, descriptie *of the plight of the
actress who had accidentally fastened
a handcuff to her wrist The public
was interested and flocked to see the
play, and the resourceful agent went
on to the next town wondering what
new thing he could spring on the sen
sation loers there— William Lof tus in

GOO ROAS
To the rural inhabitant, especially,
and the urbarrite generally, thefore
; going headline is of more than pass
ing interest While it is not especi
ally intended to mean that this is
the proper cognomen of the thor
oughfares with which our county is
blessed, it is simply a hint as to what
might be While we, of the county,
are possibly doing all in our power
to bring about such a desirable state
of affairs, without the assistance of
outside aid, there now appears a
chance for the national goernment
to not only become interested in the
improement of Amador county's,
or een California's roads, but those
•of the entire commonwealth At
least it will hae the opportunity to
become interested, and no little re
sponsibility as to whether it does or
not rests with the people them
seles The federal goernment
takes care of its riers and harbors,
protects its manufactures, helps to
; build cities, but has neer come to
consider the interest of
the man who supplies all these en
terprises with the actual necessities
of life — the farmer — to the extent
of improing his facilities for mar
keting his produce Howeer, at
this session of congress Messrs
of Tenuessee, and Gal
linger of New Hampshire, hae in
troduced in the house and senate
respectiely, a bill which has for its
object the alleiation of the bad
road difficulty The text of the bill
proides that, along with the others,
congress appropriate for the use of
road improements the sum of $2,
000,000, aailable in instalments of
$8,000,000 a year for the years 190 
56; that the amount be apportioned
to each state according to popula
tion, proided that no state receie
less than a minimum of $250,000,
and that in order for any state,
for county in same, to receie its
share of this money, a like 'amount
be raised for the purpose, where it is
to be used In New ' Jersey, Con
necticut, Massachusetts, New York,
and Pennsylania the state legis
latures hae proided a law for state
aid for roads on something of the
same principle as the foregoing, and
the results hae been farreaching
and beneficial, and there is uo doubt
such a moe on the part of the na
tional goernment would not only
proe a blessing, but is a matter of
justice and humanity to those who
contribute more to the prosperity
and stability of the nation than any
other class— the tillers of the soil If
you are interested in this matter
write your congressman to ote and
work for the passage of the bill
SUPREME COURT ECISION
We are in receipt of the full text
of the supreme court decision in the
case of E H Sanchez s E Fordyce
and Thomas Ruiz As the decision
touches one ef the ital points in
oled in the justices' and con
stable's salary cases now on appeal
to the supreme court from Amador
county, a brief statement of the
issue decided will not be without in
terest to our readers The litigants
were rial candidates for constable
Personal in Ventura township, Ventura coun
ty Sanchez was an independent can
didate, nominated by petition The
republican and democratic parties
each nominated two candidates for
r cons table; as the election proclama
tion of the board of superisors
called for the election of two con
stables'in that township, notwith
standing that the county goern
ment act of 1901 proided that in
township haing a population of less
than 6000 there shall be but one jus
tice and one constable It was con
ceded that Ventura township con
tained less than 000 people In the
recount Sanchez was found to hae
receied the greatest number of
legal ballots, and was elected, the
court refusing to count any ballot
on which more than one candidate
for constable was oted for The
supreme court sustains the lower
court in this iew In the course of
the decision the court says
The additional point is here made
that, as sec 5 art 11 of the constitu
tion authorizes the legislature to "reg
ulate the compensation of all such
officers (county officers) in proportion
to duties, and for this purpose may
classify the counties by population,"
therefore it cannot directly or indirect
ly, classify the counties for any other
 purpose than the one purpose of regu
, lating the compensation of county offi
cers We agree with appellants' coun
sel that under this proision of the con
stitution, the legislature can classify
countios but for the one purpose,, of
regulating the compensation of county
officers It has been so held by this
court, Pratt s Brown, 135 Cal 650
It cannot classify townships for the
purpose of regulating compensation
This part of the decision is taken
to be plainly indicatie of the fate of
the salary cases from Amador coun
ty The last legislature did classify
the townships of Amador county ac
cording to population for the pur
pose of fixing the compensation of
township officers In so doing, the
supreme court says the lawmaking
body exceeded its authority This
point is clearly placed in issue in
the Amador cases, so the outlook is
bright that the county will win i
this important suit Seeral other
counties hae appealed i>n the same
proposition, but Amador has* takeu
the initiatie, and will probably be
the first to get a decision
In our article on hospital finances
last week, we oerlooked the point
that the allowances for outside pa
tients aggregated nearly $300 last
year, and this system of supporting
outside patients was not inaugurated
until after the present administra
tion took charge This reduces the
difference in' the cost of hospital
maintenance for the years 1900 and
1903 to something oer $600 as
against the latter period This is a
really creditable showing, consider
ing the enhanced price of supplies
and the increased number of inmates

The Frederickjon— Yager Suit
As this case has awakened much in
terest in lone and the alley section,
and is also of interest, owing to the im
portance of tho law points inoled, " to
business men eerywhere, we deem it
proper to explain its status Yager
and the late Thomas Fredorickson were
partners in the cattle business in lone
alley The affairs of tho copartner
ship were attended lo and managed by
Geo Yager Frederickson died on the
23d of August, 1903 I April preced
ing, Frederickson deeded  bis interest
in the property embraced in the co
partnership to his wife, Adelina Fred
eriokson "This deed was placed on
record in the recorder's office in Sep
tember following, a month after tho
death of Froderlckson The recording
of the deed was the first intimation
that Yager, had of the transaction Ho
had neer boen noli God by his partner
that he had transferred his interest to
his wife It ia contended on tho one
side that the; deod from Fredorickson
to his wife dissoled tho partnership of
Yager and Fredericksoif It is con
tended on the other band, howeer,'
that a_ copartnership cannot ho ;dis
soled in this onesided manner; that
ono partner cannot substitute a person
of his own choosing to take his place in
tho firm without tho other partner's
consent Furthermore, it is held by
the Yager side that the death of Fred
erickson, not the deed to his wifo, I dis
soled the partnership On the 12th
of ecember Mrs Frederickson com
menced suit in the superior court j for
an accounting of tho partnership prop
erty, and asked for the appointment of
a receier to take possession of the
property and wind up the affairs Personal On
the 1th of ecember the court ap
pointed Thomas Clifton as receier, fix
ing the bund at $2000 On the same
day a copy of the complaint and sum
mons, also of tho order appointing a
receier was sered upon defendant
Yager, who promptly took steps to
sustain his side of the controersy
By his attorneys, Messrs Bole and
Vicini, a motion was promptly made to
hae the order appointing a receier
acated, on the ground that the ap
pointment was wrongfully procured,
and that ho was incompetent The
hearing was had on the 23d of ecem
ber, and a mass of affidaits read in
support of each side The main con
tention is that the suriing partner is
of right tho proper person to wind up
tho partnership affairs The court re
fused to acate the order appointing
Clifton as receier • From this order
the defendant proposes to appeal to the
supreme court He has filed a bond in
the sum of $5000 with  Mattley and
John Strohm as sureties The notice
of appeal and filing of the bond, ' re
places Yager in charge of the property
as before the suit was commenced The
transcript on appeal is in the hands ' of
the printer Tho case, howeer, has
not yet, as stated in a local paper, been
acted upon by the supreme court  It
is really not before that tribunal so far
All the changes that hae taken place
hae been in the superior court It

FATAL ACCIENT AT ZEILA
John Sila Struck by "a r Bock and In
stantly Killed
About four o'clocVon Tuesday after
noon a pall of sadness was thrown
around the home of Jahn Sila when
tho announcement came down from the
Zeila mine, where he was employed, of
his haing been killed In fact, the
expressions of sorrow oer his untimely
end were on the lips of tho on tiro com
munity as the news of the tragedy
spread It seems that' Mr Sila and
his partner had about finished up the
stopo at the 1200 leel, in which they
were " working, arid preparatory to
leaing it were cleaning up all the
stray patches of ore to be found In
his search for scattered bits of ore,
Sila had found quite a slab on the
hanging , wall oer his J head, i He so
cured a bar and sot about to pry it off
For some little time the rock resisted
his efforts, and he, possibly thinking it
more secure than was really tho case,
entured too near, when, without a
moment's warning the rock came down
with a crash, pinning his head between
it and one of the outer posts of a set of
timbers The fatal result was almost
instantaneous, as the ictim was only
hoard to utter two words afterward,
those being the name of his partner
The alarm was gien immediately, but
before the other miners in the icinity
reached the spot, life was extinct, and
John Sila had finished his last shift
As soon as possible the remains wore
taken out of the mine, and the coroner
notified, • who coneyed the departed,
loed one to the homo of his grinf"
stricken wife' An inquest was held
Wednesday morning, at which the facts
as aboe stated wore brought out i Mr
Sila was a natie of Portugal, haing
come to this country early in life He
had liod in Jackson for more than ten
years past, where as a man and miner
he was known as one of the best He
had been in the employ of the Zeila for
almost a year, and Manager etert
pays him great tribute not only for his
skill as a miner, but for his sterling
character as a man He is suried by
a wife, one child of his own, and four
stepchildren, his wife being a widow
at the time of their union While his
demise is a seere and irrepar
a_blo loss to Mrs Sila,' from an in
cident in their lies learned from an
acquaintance just after the fatal catas
trophe, it was the sad fulfillment of a
constant fear which was oer present
in her heart As the story goes, Mrs
Sila bad accompanied her husband to
the shaft at the Kennedy mine, whore
he was then working, on one occasion,
and just as he was about to step into
the skip to go down, as was her usual
custom she kissed him "goodbye"
Tho incident brought a smile to the
countenance of a witness standing by,
and she explained to him that each
time Mr Sila loft her to go into a
mine she was possessed of the morbid
fear that he might neer return alie,
and that this was an inariable token
of a last farewell The decedent was
an honored member of tho local lodges
of Knights of Pythias, A O U W,
Foresters of America, and the Miners'
Union, all of whom contributed their
share in making the burden of sorrow
as light aa "possible) for tho grioing
lood ones The funeral occurred from
the homo of deceased, and was con
ducted under tho auspicos of tho
Knights of Pythias, assisted by all tho
other fraternities of which he was a
member i

A ETERMINE SUICIE
Katie Thompson Takes a Fatal  ose of
Carbolic Acid
Miss Katie Thompson committed
suicide early Sunday morning at the
residence of her sister, Mrs Williams,
on Water street, Jackson, by swallow
ing a large quantity of carbolic acid
The young lady was a cripple from
childhood She was able to get around,
and hired out as a nurse wheneer she
could It was pitiful to soe her walk,
and there was no hope of any improe
ment She came here from Seattle a
few years ago, and we are informed she
had made ono or two preious attempts
to end her life bofore coming to Jack
son Within the last few days she had
complained of sickness, and appeared
more than usually despondent Indeed
she had intimated to a neighbor that
she felt like ending it all  That she
had contemplated suicide for a long
time is eident from the fact that the
poison had been in her possession for a
number of months She waited on
Thos Greonhalgh during his last ill
ness, and she had occasion to get a two
ounce ial ol carbolic acid One half of
it was used; the remaining half is bo
lieed to hae remained in her posses
sion eer since,' and was the means of
her taking off On Ihe fatal morning
she got up about seen o'clock Mrs
Williams was preparing tho breakfast
Miss Thompson came down from, her
room, and took a seat  in the room'
where her sister was at work At
length Mrs Williams was attracted by
a gurgling sound, and looking up, at
once saw that something serious was
the matter Miss  Thompson had
swallowed the entire contents of the
ial of acid The fiery fluid had scorched
her mouth, and left its mark upon her
chin and throat where it bad trickled
She was unable to speak and it is prob
able that she was unconscious from al
most the moment that she swallowed
the draught Medical aid was sent for
at once rs' Phillips and Schacht
were on hand within a quarter of an
hour, but it was too late to aert a fatal
termination The ictim left no note
to throw  any light on the tragedy
Tho cause was eidently a despondent
frame of mind, owing to her lifelong
deformity Her ' friends had noticed
some time ago the bottle containing
the poison, and thinking she had self
destruction in mind remoed the bottle
This she at once noticed, and demand
ed the restoration of the bottle, and it
was surrendered This was some time
ago, and the deceased must hae hid
den the acid away from that time, as
those in the house neer saw it until
the fatal morning
Coroner Huberty held an inquest the
same day, with the following named
persons empaneled as a juryPersonal E W
Kelley, J F Mora, BF Gilbert, W
H Carley, W J Loe, C M Meek,

ton The aboe facts were elecited at
the inquisitiou The only witnesses
examined were r B H Schacht and

turned a erdict of death by carbolic
acid poisoning, administered by her
own hand
Miss Thompson was born at Mokel
umne Hill Her parents are both dead ;
the mother being buried at the Hill,
and her father at San Andreas She
lied in Jackson seeral years ago, but
was away in Washington for some
years, and returned to Jackson from
that state about two years ago
The funeral took place Tuesday, and
was largely attended, the remains be

If the merchant or business man of

Supt Web Smith of the Kennedy mine,
he will readily bo coninced of the
error of his way In last Friday's issue
of the Ledger an attractie ad for
mules for use in the mine appeared
The ad called for animals weighing not
less than 800 or 900 pounds The ink
had hardly dried on the papor before
an enterprising mule owner, who reads
a good newspaper, was on the scene
with an animal that seemed as big as
an elephant Personal Howeer, owing to the
cost of enlarging skips, tunnels and
drifts in order to operate with so
large a ariety of animal locomotion,
the offering was declined, and the
paper hastily notified to change the
words "notlessthanßooor 9oo pounds,"
to "not more thau 800 or 900 pounds"

MINING NEWS HERE
AN ELSEWHERE
News from Mines of the Eastern Sec
tion of Amador County — efender
 Still in a Prosperous Condition
Old Gold— While all prospects da
not make mines, it goes without say
ing that, as a rule, the latter has neer
been obtained before the former The
largest and best paying mine on the
mother lode in this county was at one
time a mere prospect, and no doubt, in
years to come, the same will be said of
the country off the mother lode,' in the
eastern ' ! part of Amador county
Among the promising prospects there
are the Old Gold and New iscoery,
located about 2 ai[\isa north of Pine
Groe, and owned by the Cranmer
Bros This property has been deelop
ed to the extent of a shaft, 100 feet
deep, which is tapped by a tunnel 300
feet The alues are found in an iron
atained quartz, and also in talc The
owners are taking out a little pay rock
right along, which is treated in a small
mill' equipped with two 1000pound
stamps At present, as only deelop
ment work is being done, the mill' is
not kept going steadily, but as progress
is made the ore is sorted and milled
The mill will handle 8 tons of ore eery
2 hours  
Elephant Placer — As the prin
cipal industry in Amador county, of
course the lode mines hold the large
part of the balancn of power, but in
summing up the output of the county
the gold taken from its beds of grael
cuts no insignificant figure This
particular part of tho industry is for
the most part located along the streams
in the icinity of Volcano, where, al
though the grael was washed li f ty
years ago, the pay dirt is as rich as
when first discoered Just recently
Messrs Bradshaw, Santirfoand Baroni
hae leased a strip of ground, contain
ing  acres, on the Elephant placer,
that was left untouched wlieu the prop
erty was last operated They expect
to operate with one hydraulic pipe,
equipped with a 6inch nozzle The
grael ranges in depth from 1 to 5 feet,
and as it prospects well they anticipate
a good cleanup Owing to the state
law requiring tho permission of the
debris commission before any mining
of this character can be undertaken,
they cunnot commence work tiil ''that
body passes upon tho same, which is
Being looked for now daily
Marsino Bros — Among tho oper
ators in the placer industry, probably
those gentlemen are the largest at tho
present time' They are now, and hae
been for some time, crkingon 5 acres
of ground right on the edge of the town
of Volcano, in what is known as the
"laa beds" The "laa beds" are
large areas of grael completely coer
ed with a heay layer of laa Owing
to this laa coering it is impossible to
work with the hydraulic process In
addition to this coering of lluty like
rock oer the grael, it is streaked
through at interals with thin stratas
of cement This latter contains much
good pay, and after coming in contact
with the open air slakes so that wash
ing is possible Sometimes, howeer,
it is stored till a quantity sufficient has
been acquired, and crushed in a stamp
mill and the gold saed on plates The
Marsino boys now hae a two hundred
foot tunnel in on their ground, and are
now running crosscuts in order to
easily work the grael In working
this ground the grael is taken out in
cars and stored till sufficient has ac
cummulated to begin sluicing After
the tunnels hae been drien, a cross
cut is run on either side at its breast,
and work is commenced toward its
mouth In this way the waste is thrown
behind the miner, while nothing but
pay dirt is taken out Owing to the
nature of the laa coering no timber
ing is necessary in the tunnels', and, in
fact, ery little timber is used in min
ing the grael Where dirt has to be
mined at so great a disadantage, it is
needless to add that it must necessarily
be ery rich to make pay But, ac
cording to T A Marsino, there is
good pay in thoso beds all tho time,
and occasionally a streak is encpunter
ed that runs to a handsome figure in
deed Thirtyt}e cents is no un
common thing, and 75 cents is quite
frequent
Christenson Claim — This old
property, which has in tho past pro
duced a large amount of placer gold,
has recently passed into the hands of
the Grillo Bros, and last week James
Grillo and another man began the eonPersonal
tinuation of the 500fqqt tunnel, with
the iew of qpening up new territory
This property is supplied with a Hunt
ington mill and a good water right, and
it is expected when sufficient pay dirt
has accummulated to run most of same
through this mill In addition to this
placer enterprise tho Grillos own a
quartz claim, known as the Columbus,
located about 3} miles south of Vol
cano, which they will likely take up
and gie spme attention to this spring
As yet the Columbus is only a prqs
pect, but of so good a nature as to al
ready justify the erection of a 5stamp
mill by the former owners Howeer,
the only deelopment so far done is a
20foot tunnel on the ledge, which cuts
it at about 90 feet With the showing
tho property has already made, they
beliee it will require only a small
amount of sinking to put it in condi
tion for steady production
THE EAVVOOn— WhiIe the theory
that where gold is found in the grael
deposits its source of supply is to bo
found in ledges in the icinity has in
many instances been disproed, it cer
tainly seems to be an established fact
in the hills around Volcano and Pe
fendor, where pno soes proof aftor
proof of its oertainty At present
Kirn ball Bros, are operating tho ead
wood, located about one milo north of
efender, They are working the prop
erty by shaft, whjjjh is now down
about 60 feet At this point water was
encountered to so great an extent that
further work was impossible without
an improement on the windlass and
bucket hoist In consequence of this
they hae just recently purchased a
plant of machinery, consisting of a
boiler, pump,  and small hoist, which
will enable them to sink to a depth of
200 feet This machinery is now being
installed, and it is expected not later
than this week to continue sinking
iThe ledge is well defined between walls
of granite, ranging'in width from 6
inches to 2 feet, and the deelopment
work being done is not all dead by any
means, as the pay streak is sufficiently
good to make the expense ery light
on the operators This is proen by
the fact that a run of 19 tons of this
ore through the Sturnaraan mill at the
old Belden mine, gae a cleanup of $32
to the ton As a prospect, nothing is
more promising than the ead wood,
and the Kimballs hae  the staying
qualities to fully determine its merits
efender— lf there are any skep
tics in this county or elsewhere relatie
to the merit of the mineralized ledges
in the Pioneer district, they certainly
are proof against argument made of
absolute facts The efender mine,
employing about 19 men and constantly
producing good pay rock, seems to the
writer sufficient eidence that this part
of Amador county is yet to make its
mark as a gold producer The e
fender also proes the fact that the
Pioneer , district offers good induce
ments to the small operator — the man
who is unable to pay for large plants of
machinery The greatest depth so far
obtained on this property is 320 feet,
but at the 100 and 200 leels much
drifting has been done on either side of
the shaft, and between these two about
half the ground opened up has been
stoped At the 300 leel the ledge is a
width of about 16 feet, and here about
10 feet of drifting has been completed,
but as yet but little of this ground has
been stoped For the present the en
tire force of the mine will be deoted
to taking out this large body ' of min
eral, and a little later in the spring
manager Joyce, who is the principal
owner, intends starting down again
The ore in the ' efender consists of
both a mill and smelter product The
former, of course, is a clear quartz
rock,' while the latter is an iron pyrites
heaily stained with copper of the pea
cock ariety, and is almost identical in
appearance to the ore produced in the
Glacier and Reenue tunnel mines in
Ouray county, Colorado,  one of the
largest properties in that part of the
state The mill ore, Mr, Joyce tolls us,
runs as high as $35 to the ton, although
the aerage is $10 His smelting pro
duct, of which he had about 3 tons
sacked ready for shipment last Satur
day, aerages about  $70 to the ton
The mine is equipped with a hoisting
plant,' Hendy rock breaker, and ton
stamp mill The hoist, though small,
will sink to a depth of 900 feet The
ore is sorted at the collar of the shaft;
that for the mill being trammed a dis
tance of about 100 feet, when it is
dumped on a grizzly, the fine stuff pass
ing to a 25ton storage bin below, the
large dropping to a resere bin aboe
the crushor, into which it is fed auto
matically As yet no plan for conten
traling the tailings from the plates has
been adopted, but Mr Joyce, has con
cluded to sae the tailings from now on
for future treatment While he does
not impress one as an optimistic dream
er, Mr Joyce does not hesitate to say
that the efender is a good paying in
estment now, and he beliees is the
making of one of Amador county's
biggest and best producers '
Argonaut — There are between
30 and 0 men now employed at this
mine At the 1600 leel the station
has been cut, and drifting toward the
ledge is how in progress Eerything
is moing along nicely While the
new leels are being opened, it is the
intention te sink the shaft another 200
feet   •
MISCELLANEOUS
Ross Morgan has been sureying the
past week the boundary line between
the Zeila mine and the Pleming prop
erty, recently purchased by Fred
Eudey 
While in Volcano recently, the Led
ger man was informed that not an idle
man was to be found in that camp
And, too, the boast was made that
they were all working for themseles'
This speaks well for any community
The old McLaughlin placer claim,
Volcano, is being worked by the San
tirfo' Bros They hae made some
good cleanups in the past, ' and are
getting good grael now' 7
As soon as the weather conditions
improe, Wm Bellderain expects to
continue sinking on his Caslota claim,
located about 2 miles south of efender
He has a well defined ledge on the
property, and has gotten good returns
from ore treated in the past So far,
though, the ore has been pocketty, but
he thinks ery little more depth is nec
essary to make the ledge more regular,
and of sufficient size to pay While at
his place we were shown some, of the
most beautiful specimens of free gold
quartz one can find anywhere
Which Is It?
When one frequently hears the ex
pression that "so and so thinks he
owns the earth," the remark is treated
as a joke, but when an indiidual in
business, regardless of ita oharacter,
actually assumes that he is the abso
lute owner of all business of the general
public in his community, in his line, he
is either a dreamer, an egotist, a fool,
or afraid of competition Such a man
hasp't the slightest conception of what
business principles are He is simply
trying to get and retain a hold on the
community through sentimentality
pure and simple Business men, as a
rule, consider well their ability to hold
their own against any and all competi
tion, in thuir line, in the community
they select for the inestment of their
capital, and when legitimate competi
tion comes they meet it like men, not
by whining that because of their ha
ing happened t,o cast their lots in any
certain place, its people owed them a
debt of gratitude, which should be re
paid by indignities to an indiidual
with an equal amount of enterprise to
whom, as far as sentimentality goes,
as much regard ia due as to any other
goqd citizen, Of course, it isn't often
one comes ia cQntaot with this class of
business(?) men, but when he is en
countered people wonder if he was al
ways the baby boy of his father's
household

before County Clerk Culbert and filed
an abandonment of this homestead Personal en
try Tho' reason for this action, it
seems, was because of the fact that
almost eery foot of the ground was
contested ' by ' prior, mining locations,
and the contestants were on hand, to a
man, to support their mineral claims

A FAMOUS PERFUME
elicious Attar of Roses Is Chiefly
Made In Bulgaria
The far famed otto (or attar) of roses
Is chiefly, made in Bulgaria Kasanllk
Is the center of the rose growing coun
try Red roses only are used in mak
ing the perfume, but white roses, which
grow more freely, form the hedges of
the fields
The trees, which grow to* a great
height, are separated by paths nine
feet in width to allow the oxen and
plow to pass The perfume is obtained
not only from the petals, but also from
the stalks and leaes These gie a
peculiar scent, which adds greatly, to
the delicacy of the perfume of tho
petals
October, April and June are the
months for planting branches of the
old trees Weeding, pruning and digging
are necessary for three years, when
they are full grown and repay the labor
(spent upon them by bearing for twenty
years
The discoery of the delicious attar
was quite an accident and took place
three centuries ago The Persian Prin
cess Nour Jlhan was strolling through
the splendid galleries of her palace
with  her betrothed (the Mongolian
Prince Jihanguyr) and noticed in the
rosewater  basins about the passages
an ugly, yellowish oil floating on the
surface Orders were instantly gien
to remoe the unsightly fluid, when it
was discoered the perfume was also
remoed Thus the irtue of the essen
tial oil was found out, which Is still
called in Persia "Attar Jlhan"
Culture and Riches
If onetenth as much attention were
deoted to the fools among the middle
and working classes as is deoted' to
the fool sons of the rich, we should be
ln danger of belieing with  Carlyle
that the people are "mostly fools" It
is true that the culture of the suddenly
rich Is cruder and narrower than the
culture of those who hae had genera
tions of wealth and leisure, but culture
Is relatie The culture of the most
cultured classes in the old world is the
result of large wealth possessed for
generations Culture is a matter of
growth, but it neer grows in poerty
The cheapness of the culture of the
ery rich In this country as compared
with that  of the aristocracy of old
countries Is simply, the difference be
tween youth and age, a difference of
experience There Is a comparatie
cheapness in the culture, bearing and
manners of the people of the west
as compared with those of the east,
and for the same reason The aristoc
racy of the south and of New England
hae a refinement quite unlike that of
the newly made rich in New York and
Chicago and the west They hae been
longer ln the making— Gunton's Maga

SliniiiK the Bridegrroom
The shaing of the bridegroom on his
wedding day is a Bulgarian custom
which, handed down from preChris
tian days, Is still obsered j with due
formality, especially in country dis
tricts While the barber Is at his
task a dancing crowd of young folks
surrounds him and the bridegroom
As the tatter's hair is cut the snippings
are carefully collected by some of the
girls for preseration in one of the
bride's chests The barber, when his
work is done, receies a small white
linen cloth as a present and also a
trifling sum of money from each person
there  Then the bridegroom kisses the
hands of the girls, washes his face and
dons his' wedding dress, which must
first be carefully weighed three times
by one of the boys
Highland Makeshifts
A few years ago accommodations In
the highlands of Scotland were ery
primitie It Is related that the young
uchess of Gordon, on Inquiring how
the late duchess managed to entertain so
much company at Klnrara, where there
seemed no room, was told by the butler
that for weeks at a time be had slept
on the top of the kitchen dresser A
niece and two other young ladies were
known to hae slept in the duchess'
bedroom, which probably was not large,
for they were sent out to wash in the
neighboring brook Miss Macdonell of
Glengarry, who told this, said also that
there was a waterfall near Ochtertyre
which the late Sir William Murray and
his brothers used as their shower bath

VORACIOUS CANARIES
Appetite of a Bird Much Greater
Than Aejasre Man's
When an old fashioned hostess
urges her guests to eat, after the con
entional manner of showing hospi
tality and remarks, 'fWhy, you haen't
the appetite of a bird," she really
speaks the truth, though she dees not
Intend to  
The aerage man, if he had a bird's
appetite, would deour from thirty to
thirtyone pounds of food a day, which
would be a tax on the larder of his
hostess
Recent experiments hae proed that
the aerage bird manages to eat about
onefifth of his own weight dally with
ease, if he can get so much food, and
in a wild state, though the bird has to
hunt for his daily proender, he is eat
ing a large part of the time during the
day and manages to get his full ra
tions
The smaller the bird the more ora
cious seems to be its appetite and its
power of absorption 
* A German scientist ' recently kept a
canary under obseration for a month
The little creature weighed only j six
teen | grams, but ln the course of the
month it managed to eat 512 grams
weight of food— that is, about thirty
two times its own weight The bird
must therefore hae eaten  its ' own
weight in food eery day  '
An ordinary man with a canary's ap
petite would consume 150 pounds of
food a day
But the canary is an extreme case
The ordinary bird, in good health, will
be satisfied with onefifth of its weight
a day by way of food— Answers

the last state lottery which was held ln
this country, says a writer in the Lon

green and yellow At the top are the
royal arms, while below, in the center
of the paper, is the announcementPersonal
"Positie! By order of the lords of his
majesty's treasury, on Wednesday
next, 18th October, lotteries close for

£30,000 will be distributed on that day
as the parting gifts of Fortune" The
adertisement concludes with a foot
note to the effect that Slewright Is
selling lottery shares and ! tickets at

wright was a well known stock and
share broker of the day, who made a
specialty of lottery tickets He was
ery fond of attracting clients by the

of the simplest character, of which the
following is a fair examplePersonal

One of Japnn'a Jewels
The great attraction  of Kamakura
and one of the jewels of Japan is the
aibutsu, or great bronze Buddha We
approach it through a tree lined ae
nue and get the first and best iew of
it at a distance of some 200 feet It is
a sitting figure, 9 feet 7 Inches high,
97 feet 2 inches In circumference The
face is 8 feet 5 inches long and from
ear to ear 17 feet 9 inches wide The
eyes, which are pure gold, ore nearly
two feet long The circumference of
the thumb is three feet Those figures
gie some idea of the size, and the fig
ure is eleated on a stone platform
some twele to fifteen feet aboe the
person approachiug it But no descrip

of the face It is bent gently forward
as if in brooding contemplation of the

Fortunes In Picture Frames
Some splendid picture frames may be
seen eery year at the Royal academy
exhibition, but the finest and costliest
frame eer made for a picture was that
which incloses the "Virgin and Child"
in Milan cathedral It is made of ham
mered gold, with an inner molding of
lapis lazuli The corners of this alu
able frame hae hearts designed in
large pearls and precious stones Some
Idea of its alue may be gained when
it is stated that the frame is eight feet
Song and six feet wide Its estimated
worth is £23,000 One of the pictures
in the Vatican at Rome is in a frame
xtudded with jewels The picture is
a'aluable one, but the frame nearly
equals the alue of the painting

Some Bta; Words That  Hae Becit
j Consigned to Obliion  
The number of obsolete words that

The Bridal Veil
The origin of the bridal eil is a dis
puted question that will probably neer
be settled Some j see in It nothing
more than a milliner's substitute for
the usual flowing tresses which half
concealed and half reealed a bride's
beauty as she knelt at the altar This
opinion is countenanced by the fact
that Elizabeth Stuart was not thought
to require an artificial eil, as nature
had gien her an affluence of hair
Others see its origin In the eil of the
Hebrews', marriage j ceremony or the
yellow "flammeum" " of old Roman
brides
A third source is the old "care cloth"
of, the AngloSaxons, a square estment
held oer both bride and bridegroom
till they receied the nuptial  benedic
tion So runs the use of the church of
Sarum and the Hereford missal
Lastly, it has been held to be merely
an amplification of the coif which medi
aeal brides wore between the garland
and their hair  Margaret Tudor wore
this under her coronet on her marriage
to the king of Scotland
Eolution of the Bed
Bedstead originally meant "the 'bed
place" The truckle bed was the first
adance on the bench, and then the
tester suspended from the roof Then
came ln the Arabian bed — a name per
haps deried from the crusades, j The
four poster came from Austria in the
fifteenth century The late Queen Vic
toria always carried her bedstead about
with her, and so did the nobles ln the
middle ages The coerlid or counter
point, whence comes counterpane, was
often splendidly embroidered Yet the
beds at this time wero often only sacks
of straw Feather beds came from
France In the fourteenth century, but
straw was in general use long after
Blankets' of wool were not introduced
by Blanket of Bristol, who made them,
for the word, in the sense of a coarse
woolen fabric, existed before
Very Abaentmlnded
The celebrated German historian
Theodor Mommsen was the most ab
sentmlnded of men Once wnile going
from Berlin to Charlottenburg, a half
hour's journey, the" trolley car in which
he rode went off the track  The rest of
the passengers took another car and
went ahead, and the stranded ehicle
was abandoned till help could be found
Mommsen remained reading his book
An hour or two later the sound of
Jacks, leers, derricks, etc, aroused
him' Rising from his seat, he went to
the door and, with the most complete
unconcern I imaginable, remarked, "I
suppose we hae come to a standstill!"
The Polite Germans
We Germans are not only the most
polite, but also the most ceremonious
people in the world Without ceremony
it Is not possible for us to present a
friend, to take a seat in a restaurant or
to drink or een to utter a single word
Consequently a people like the British,
which ignores and utterly disregards
these customs, must appear to us a herd

Cariosities of Cat Glass
The process of glass cutting requires
great skill and care A design is first
lightly copied on the glass, and the
cutters take it in hand A fine stream
of sand and water falls continuously
on a rapidly reoling steel wheel To
this" the glass is applied, and the cut
ting is really accomplished by the fric
tion which the sand sets up Then an
other workman with another steel
wheel and plain water brings the cut
ting up to a sharper edge A third
workman with a soft wooden tool takes
off the cloudiness caused by the fric
tion of the steel, a fourth polishes the
glass, a fifth with a preparation of ox
ide of tin gies to it that iridescent
luster which makes us alue cut glass
so highly

Norah's warm Irish heart came to tlw
rescue "Shure, Mrs Hersey, dear"
she replied quickly, ''if you looked like
that would I eer hae two af ternoorw
a week?"— Christian Register

pecunious minister, i'but I cannot 'eat
souls, anil, if I could, it would take a
good mrjiy souls the size of yours to

Mr Henpeck— What are you talking
about?
Mrs Henpeck— Why, a man who has
one wife too many is a "bigamist,"
isn't he? 
Mr Henpeck— Not necessarily—Phil
