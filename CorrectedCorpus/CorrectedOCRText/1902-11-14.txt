REMARKABLE LAKE
A Body of Water With a Roof of
Solidified Salt
A lake with a salt roof isn't frozen
salt and it isn't underground On the
contrary, this remarkable lake may be
seen at any time during the year, fully
exposed, being een at its best when
the sun is shining directly upon it.
This wonderful body of water is one of
the saltest of the salt lakes and Is sit
uated near Obdorsk, Siberia The lake
is nine miles wide and seenteen long
and within the memory of man was
not entirely roofed oer by the salt de
posit Originally eaporation played
the most prominent part hi coating the
lake oer with salt, but at the present
time the salt springs which surround
it are adding fast to the thickness of
the crust
In the long ago rapid eaporation of
the lake's waters left great salt crys
tals floating on the surface In course
of time these caked together Thus the
waters were finally entirely coered
In ISTS the lake found an underground
outlet Into the rier Obi which low
ered Its surface about three feet The
salt crust was so thick, howeer, that
it retained its old leel and now pre
sents the curious spectacle of a salt
roofed hike The salt coat increnses
sis inches in thickness eery, year The
many islands with which tht> lake Is
studded are said to net ns braces and
to help keep the arched salt crust in
position

AN ENGLISHMAN'S WIFE
(he Is Really Her'Haaband'a Bnalaeaa
Partner and Acta It
"In England," says Ainslee's Maga
tlne "a man's wife Is In renlity his
partner, and whether or not the two
are In harmony with each other In af
fection In all material things they rec
pgnize that then? fortunes are Irreoca
bly bound together, that the interests
of both are quite, identical and that
each has just as strong a motie for
making things go well as has the other,
since they share equally the labor and
the reward therefrom They may hae
then priate disagreements, but they
front the world together The wife
takes tbe keenest interest In the most
minute details of eerything that af
fects her husband's welfare She
knows his income to a penny She
manages her household as a chancellor
of the exchequer manages the nation's
outlay, so that the annual budget shall
not only aoid a deficit and shall accu
rately' balance, but so that it shall
sbow a surplus She will practice a
rigid economy if necessary, and in do
lug so sue will feel tbat she is merely
carrying out her share of the marriage
contract It is tbe man's part to make
money; It is her part to help' him sae
It She pliius nothing for herself apart
from him She cannot think of him as
in anything apart from her If he Is
In political life, she enters Into his am
bitions with intelligence and zeal She
will write his letters for him and en
tertain his constituents She will study
the bluebooks and teach herself to un
derstand the public 'questions with
which be has to deal, so that she may
discuss them with him and follow his
career intelligently She belongs to
him, in fact as he belongs to her
There Is not much display of sentiment
in an English household after the first
year of married life has ended, bnt
there is tbe bond of a common interest
which grows stronger eery day and
eery year and which gies to man
and wife a unity of purpose and of
feeling that will beyond comparison
outlast the cobweb tissues of emotion

Burial Alie
Though it is possible that cases of
burial of liing persons may still occur,
fortunately they are more rare than in
former times Een the doctor's orders
against Interment were not always
obeyed, for the Gentleman's Magazine
of 1751 relates the case of Richard
Carson of Hay, Herefordshire, Eng
land, who was supposed to hae died,
but a doctor declared that Carson still
lied and ordered that he was not to bo
buried His relaties paid no heed to
the injunction, and the body was com
mitted to the grae next day A per
son passing through the churchyard
beard a noise and preailed on the
clerk to open the grae, where the
supposed corpse was found in a pro
fuse sweat and bleeding at the nose
Unfortunately the man was beyond re
coery and soon died
The Llama
In Boliia, one of the highest inhab
itated countries on the globe— La Paz,
the capital, being 12,000 feet aboe the
sea leel— much use is made of that
graceful and inaluable pack animal,
the llama, which will trael farther
and with een less food than tbe burro,
but will not carry more than 150
pounds The llama in some respects re
sembles the camel, kneeling In camel
fashion to receie its load, and it will
not rise if more than 150 pounds are
placed on its back; moreoer, the
weight must be eenly distributed oer
its back and sides '  
Grapes
"Grapes dissole and dislodge grael

CHOATE'S AVICE
M ted n Choleric Client Into th
Patha of Peace
It seems always to hae hin within
th» power of the distinguished lawyer
and humorist, Rufus Choate, to lead
a choleric client from ways of anger
into the paths of peace Just before
the war a southern gentleman wa»
dining with a friend In one of the best
hotels of Boston He was of French
Creole extraction, and his name was
elacour, says a writer In Lippincott's
Magazine The waiter was a colored
man, and the southerner gae his or
ders in a ery domineering fashion,
finding fault freely with what was put
before him and the way In which it
was sered Finally the waiter became
Incensed and told Mr elacour to go
to a place warm and remote The lat
ter /sprang furiously to his feet and
would bae shot the offender dead If
he ihad not been restrained by his
wiser friend, who saidPersonal
"You can't do that sort of thing here
You will hae to remember where you
are" Personal
"o you suppose that 1 am going to
put up with such Insolence and not
be reenged?" said the enraged man
"Certainly not But do it by process
of law"
The landlord was first Interiewed
and the waiter discharged That was
not sufficient to satisfy the wounded
feelings of Mr elacour He asked
who was the best lawyer in the city
and was told it was Rufus Choate
"Making his way to his office, he saidPersonal
, "Mr Choate, I want to engage you
in a case What will your retaining
The check was made out and handed
oer
"Now," said the lawyer, "what are
the facts of the case?"
He was told Said Mr Choate
thoughtfullyPersonal
"I know the United States law on
the subject well, and I know the law
of the commonwealth of Massachu
setts, and I can assure you, sir, that
there is no power on earth strong
enough to force you to go to that
place If you don't want to go And If
I were you I wouldn't"
"Well," said the southerner, accept
ing the situation, "I think I'll take your
adice" And they parted good friends
POULTRY 'POINTERS
Supply plenty of grael to fowls that
are being fattened In confinement
Chickens should neer be allowed to
go on the roosts until ten or twele
weeks old
Lime is a purifier and should be used
as a wash on the coops, perches and
nest boxes '
' If a hen lays soft shelled eggs, gie
her plenty of grael, oyster shells and
crushed bone
ucks should be allowed as much
liberty as possible They are not par
tial to confinement
Flat eggs, eggs within eggs, double
yolked eggs and other unnatural for
mations are due to the hens being oer
fat
Geese may be fattened on any kind
of grain if fed all that they will eat for
about ten days before sending them to,
market Corn, peaa and barley are'
best
Young chicks of fancy breeding
should not be permitted to rooet on
perches until after they are eight
months old, as it often causes crooked
breast bones
Accumulating filth Is a prolific source
of disease, especially gapes After the
poultry yard is cleaned up sprinkle It
well with diluted carbolic acid and a

while all were absorbed in conersa

pair of scissors,' was under the table
also and trying to cut the dog's ears
with them From one ear of the bull
the blood was running, and yet the
dog was making not the slightest ef
fort to escape or defend himself The
host and father, outraged by the ei
dence of such cruelty on the" part of
the child, determined on immediate
punishment But when he undertook
to carry the punishment into effect the
dog Interfered, pushing himself be

Salt pork is a famous old
fashioned remedy for con

pork," was the adice to the
consumptie 50 and 100
years ago
Salt pork is good if a man
can stomach it The idea
Behind it is that fat is the
iooj the consumptie needs
most
Scott'sEmulsionisthemod
ern method of feeding fat to
the consumptie Pork is too
rough for sensitie stomachs
Scott's Emulsion is the most
refined of fats, especially
prepared for easy digestion
Feeding him fat in this
way, which is often the only
way, is half the battle, but
Scott's Emulsion does more
than that There is some
thing about the combination

A BANK'STORYo
Am Incident That Startled the Old
Lady of Throddnoedlo Street
Some years ago the directors of the
Bank of England were startled to re
ceie an Initation to meet axi un
known man in the strongroom of the
bank at midnight "You think you is
ail safe hand yon bank bis safe, but
I knows better J bin hinslde the

so hif yer will mett mcc in the great

guarded the next night In spite of a
disposition to regard the letter as a
hoax by police and— nothing happened
The next phase of the mystery was
more astonishing than eer A heay
chest of papers and securities taken
from the strongroom arried at the

licited was highly essential to his case
In writing this epistle he made use of
a letter head with his printed address

After waiting seeral days for the
reply, which did not come, he again

they jogged on toward the enemy The

TALK OF CONTEST
A howl is being made all oer the
state on account of the throwing out of
ballots stamped opposite the words
"No nomination " There is no ques
tion that both parties lost heaily from
this cause ' The supreme court, has
held that a cross so placed is a dis
tinguishing mark within the meaning
of the law, and that ballots so marked
should be rejected In nearly eery
county in the state there were acancies
on the ticket, designated in this man
ner In some counties the republicans
were at a disadantage in this respect,
while in others the democrats were the
losers In Amador county the repub
licans had one unfilled space of this
character on the county ticket, in the
office of recorder, while both republi
cans and democrats had one or more in
each, township for township officers
Outside of Jackson, howeer, we hae
not heard that any otes were rejected
because of their being stamped in either
of those spaces The matter was
brought to the attention of seeral
election boards, j(nd they decided to
count such ballots In North Jackson,
East Jackson, and West Jackson a
number of ballots were rejected on this
score, amounting in all to about 30
They were all republican tickets, as
the democratic ticket had no unfilled
place in township one In rejecting
them, the boards acted at the request
of democratic attorneys, who appeared
before them and urged them to take
this course, on the strength of a de
cision of the supreme court to that
effect The republican ote on the
head of the ticket would hae been 'at
least 40 more had it not been for this
action We do not beliee in disfran
chisingPersonal a citizen on such friolous
grounds If such technical construc
tions of the law are to goern, it is not
surprising that the repeal of the Aus
tralian oting system is being agitated
In a number of precincts in this coun
ty the number of ballots counted for
goernor fell 15 per cent short of the
total number of otes cast This is a
serious discrepancy, and out of all pro
portion to the lost otes under the Personal old
system With all its faults, howeer,
the present ballot law is an improe
ment on the oldtime method The
cry for its repeal will meet with scant
faor In the end, the discussion which
has resulted from the ''no nomination"
feature, will probably lead to a more
liberal interpretation of the law in re
gard to distinguishing marks, or ' a
modification of the law, so that such a
simple mistake on the part of the oter
shall not warrant the throwing out of
the entire ballot The talk of contest
ing the election of Pardee on this score
is moonshine The democrats fully
belieed they were going to land their
man in the goernor's chair, and they
found a morsel of comfort in the de
lusion that had the rejected ballots
been counted the outcome would hae
been different, They kicked in both
directions They were loud in demand
ing that ballots so marked should be
thrown out in Amador and other coun
ties; they are now equally loud in say
ing that such otes should, hae been
counted in other counties where their
candidates were the chief sufferers

Walnuts in Amador ' County,
[Communicated]
It used to be thought that the so
called English walnut counld not profit
ably be grown anywhere in California
except on certain deep rich soils near
the coast in the southern part of the
state It is still true that the most
productie walnut orchards are found
in that locality; but repeated trials and
the introduction of new arieties hae
proed that softshell walnuts can be
grown to adantage in other localities
with quite different climatic conditions,
notably in the foothill region of central
California, of which Amador county
forms a part The success of Felix
Gillet of Neada county, and of other
pioneer growers in the introduction of
new arieties, hardier than the old Los
Angeles nut, has greatly extended the
area of walnut culture in the state, and
demonstrated that the softshell walnut
may be successfully grown whereer a
moderate depth of soil and adequate
moisture may be had, coupled with
reasonable freedom from late spring
frosts >
Such situations may readily be found
in Amador county,' as is shown by the
results obtained at arious points in
this neighborhood, particularly at the
Agricultural Experiment Station,
where a number of the best arieties
are now in bearing
Early plantings of walnut trees in
this county were made on' the creek
bottoms, where they hae seldom borne
fruit, the blossoms being usually nipped
by frost The trees at the station are
on a hilltop, or, to be more exact, on a
high saddle between two summits, at
an eleation of nearly 2000 feet aboe
sea leel— a location much less subject
to frosts than the low lands along' the
creeks, but no more faored in this re
spect than many other places in the
foothills of this county Here, there
were planted in 1889, the following soft
shell arietiesPersonal The Common English
or Madeira nut, Santa Barbara soft
shell, warf Prolific or Praeparturiens,
Mayette, Franquette, Vourey, Serotina
or St John, Chaberte, Kapbazi (Per
sian) and Bijou These began to bear
in 1896, though Bijou and Santa Bar
bara softshell bore a little the preious
year Madeira and Chaberte hae
neer borne more than a few nuts until
the present year, but the other arie
ties hae gradually increased their
crops as the trees grow older
Bijou, a ariety of French origin 1 ,
has so far proen the most productie,
and also bears the largest nut The
nut is peculiar in shape, oal, pointed
at both ends, in size about 2} inches by
1§ inches The shell is much cor
rugated, and is ery soft, so as to be
easily broken by the fingers It does
not fill perfectly, and consequently the
kernel is not as large as one would sup
pose from the size of the shell, but it is
neertheless much larger than that of
any other ariety The tree is a ig
orous grower, and so far a regular and
heay bearer Its crop this year was
115 pounds
Next to  Bijou in productieness
comes the Santa Barbara softshell and
Praeparturiens (warf Prolific), both
good growers and regular bearers of
good crops The nuts of each are of
medium size and excellent quality
Each bore about 50 pounds this year
None of the other arieties approach
those trees in growth or bearing, but
it should be noted that these are on
deeper soil than the others, and 're
ceie some irrigation by seepage from
the garden, as also does the Persian
The other arieties hae so far had no
irrigation, and  hae borne but small
crops, in no case exceeding 16 pounds
to the tree The best of them are the
Franquette, Mayette and Vourey, all
French arieties of much promise,
bearing nuts of large size and the finest
quality, the flaor being particularly
delicate Franquette, the largest of
them, has a shell naturally so light
colored as to need no bleaching May
ette and Vourey also are noteworthy in
this respect Considering the size and
quality of their fruit, and the import
ant fact that these arieties put forth
their leaes three weeks later thai>
those preiously mentioned, and are
thus mnch less likely to be caught by
spring fro3ts, they undoubtedly desere
wide trial in the foothills On deeper
soil with more moisture than they hae
had hitherto at the station they would
probably bear better; indeed, it is not
unlikely that they may improe in this
respect at the station as the trees grow
older
Serotina and Chaberte also leaf out
late in the season, but so far they hae
not berne well enough at the station to
merit recommendation

kind you hae always considered best

the city Wednesday eening, and will
remain in Jackson until the closingout
auction sale of her father's stock of dry
goods is concluded
eafness Cannot be Cared
by local applications as they cannot
reach the diseased portion of the ear
There is only one way to cure deafness,
and that is by constitutional remedies
eafness is caused by an inflamed con>
dition of the mucous lining of the Eus
tachian Tube When this tube is in
flamed you hae a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed, deafness is the result,
and unless the inflammation can be
taken out and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be de
stroyed foreer; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is noth
ing but an inflamed condition of the
mucous surfaces
We will gie One Hundred ollars
for any case of eafness (caused by ca
tarrh) that cannot be cured by Hall's
Catarrh Cure Send for circulars, free

The Passing of Benny Boss
Benjamin Rots jr depated this life
at the Clara Barton hospital, San Fran
cisco, on the 28th day of October, after
an illness of nearly two years All was
done for him that could be done by the
best medical skill at his home in Vol
cano, aud also in Agels Camp At
one time the disease from which he
suffered seemed to hae yielded to the
treatment he receied, and his rela
ties and friends had hopes of his ulti
mate recoery, but it proed to be only
temporary relief It was then thought
adisable to remoe him to San Fran
cisco, in order that he might bao the
skillful nursing that his case demanded
It was soon known that the disease
from which ho suffered (malignant
cancer) must proe fatal Ho lied
only about a week after reaching the
hospital Ho kept on his ;foet till the
last, haing walked four blocks only a
few hours before he died His sister,
Miss Grace Ross, was with him in his
last moments The news of his death
cast a feeling of sadness oer his many
friends in iVoleano, and brought tho
deepest sorrow to his widowed mother,
whose grief oer the death of her hus
band, tho late lamented Benjamin
Ross sr, the hand of time had hardly
softened After the death of his father,
young Benny, although not strong,
braely and cheerfully assumed the
duties of bread winner, and for months
perseered in the most laborious work,
cheerfully and without complaint On
the ery day he died he had a smile
and a pleasant word for eeryone
Eerybody liked Benny Ross, and
deeply regret his untimely death
Benjamin Ross jr, was born in Volcano,
Amador county, Cal, on tho 24th of
Sept, 1881 \
He lett us in Autumn, when flowers were fading,
T'was the springtime ot life whun bo bade us
adieu,
And left us to mourn o'er thu grae wbcre they
laid him,
For the loed ono whose heart was so tender
and true
That dear form will be missed from the family
circle,
That dear face we will sco on earth neer more
Though we must go on in sorrow and trouble,
Let this thought console us, his sorrows aro

the Montgomery (Ala) Adertiser, of

the dinner hour In Washington He
said the common people ate dinner at
12, the next aboe them at 1, the mer
chants at 2, the representaties at 8,
the senators at 4, members of the cabi
net at 5 and the ice president at 0
"But when does the president dine?"
"WUat! Old Hickory?" said Crockett,
anxious to fix a time that would suit
his idea of Jackson's greatness "WelL

A MAN'S BLUSHES
Bo Will Fly the Red Signal Mora
Quickly Than a Woman
"If there is any one thing that makes
ni'» want to get up and talk right out
in meeting it Is to "hear It said of a
man that 'he blushes like a woman,' "
said the social philosopher to a repre
sentatie of the New York Times
"How women eer gained the repu
tation of haing run up a corner in
blushes is beyond my comprehension
The report does her a grae injustice,
for as a matter of fact she not only has
no monopoly in blushes, but does not
make use of the share that properly
belongs to her There are some wo
men, of course, who blush if you een
blink an eyelid in their direction, but
ac a general thing men blush much
more readily and more iolently than
women
"This Is not a random statement that
I am making for the purpose of hear
ing myself talk, but a sober deduction
founded on careful obseration For
years I hae made it a point to study
the sexes in moments of embarrass
ment, and the statistics I hae Jotted
down proe that In nine cases out of
ten the aerage man will fly the red
signal of distress much more quickly
than the aerage woman This holds
goodjn all sorts of situations
"Crack a joke at a man's expense,
he blushes; ply him with awkward
questions, he blushes; subject him to
some humiliation or let some ludicrous
accident befall him in public, and he
straightway rials the boiled lobster
in hue A woman may redden slightly
under the same circumstances, but her
blush *is diluted and perfunctory com
pared with the brilliant, sunlit glow
that suffuses the countenance of man
"I don't attempt to explain the phe
nomenon—physiologists and moralists
may do that If they can — but merely
gie the fnio iVr what they are worth
in the hope that the next time n story
writer has a crop of blushes to dispose
of he will ring a few changes on the
old phrase that has done duty for gen
erations and say of the heroine that
she 'blushed like a man'"
FIRE ALARM BOXES
The System In New York and How It
Is Operated
Greater New York is thickly studded
with lamppost flre alarm boxes The
directions on each box, which is paint
ed red and Is surmounted at night by a
red light, arePersonal
"Turn handle to right until* door
opens; then pull Inside hook once and
shut the door" The opening of the
box rings a large bell in the door,
which alarm is intended to notify any
one in the neighborhood, especially the
nearest policeman, that the box has
ben opened The policeman will then
make sure that this was not done out
of mischief by some one who wanted to
see the engines arrie or, as recently
happened, by a raw maidserant who
wanted to mail a letter When the in
side leer is pulled down and let go It
sets in motion a certain clockwork that
ticks out the number of the box three
times In succession at headquarters In
Sixtyseenth street Not only that
but it makes a record upon a tape,
showing the number of the box and the
exact second at which the leer was
pulled 
A clerk who sits night and day be
side the headquarters instrument notes
the number and selects from a drawer
a certain disk which when inserted in
the proper apparatus causes the alarm
to be rung in the station houses of the
district in which that firebox is situat
ed The aerage time required to se
lect this disk and send out the alarm is
ten seconds There are always two
clerks and sometimes three in this de
partment Not a word is spoken An
outsider would hardly know that an
alarm is going out In order to preent
seeral alarms coming at the same
time from people who see the same fire
and run to different boxes no two
neighboring boxes are on the same cir

FCRCING A FASHION
Bow Uats Were Introduced t» tM
South African Saages
Audrles e Villiers, a Boer, was thft
person who first introduced hats among
til South African naties, says the
Hatters' Gazette, and profit not phi
lanthropy, was his motie One morn
Ing many years ago he chanced in Port
Elizabeth to come across a consign
ment of damaged hats offered for a
un re song He bought the whole lot,
packed them away in his wagon and
started for Kaflirland
When he reached Tembulaud, he un
loaded his stocl aliened his kegs of liq
uor, without which no trade was made
I those days, aud began business But
he found his enture likely to proe an
unprofitable one The naties did not
want hats They wanted blankets and
beads and looking glasses  and 1 aboe
nil liquor, but they looked askance at
hats  Then a bright Idea came to An
dries He wanted to* lntroduce those
hats, ne did Introduce them His sim
ple expedient was to refuse to sell any
thing to a Kaffir unless he bought a
hat too The Kaffirs wanted his goods,
sathey bought the hats
When a Kaffir buys anything, he
feels bound to make use of it The na
ties therefore donned their head gear
and returned to their kraals Now ap
peared the brilliancy of the trader's
Idea Fashion rules the world It is as
strong In Africa as in America, and
when those who had stayed at home
saw the traelers return In all the glo
ry of this strange coering they felt
behindhand and old fashioned Their
desire to possess the latest" thing In
hats became intense They paid An
dries a isit, and his stock no longer
hung heay upon his hands The hats
were soon sold "
This happened some time ago, and
now eery trading store keeps a supply
of hats constantly on hand They are
said to be manufactured expressly for
the naties, and no one who glances at
the show will doubt It 
A JUGGLER'S TRICK
CleTer Feat of Illnsion Performed by
an Bast Indian
The wonderful feats of East Indian
jugglers hae formed the theme of
many* a letter from  traelers In the
orient, but none is more* surprising than
that for which an old seadog ouches
Wlille he was an officer on board a
P and O steamship two naties came
aboard at Madras, be says They were
a juggler and his assistant After they
had performed  a number of minor
feats and gathered ' quite a crowd
around them they called for a sack
and a piece of sailcloth
These' haing been proided, the
chief juggler made a small tentlike
structure with the canas and some
stools He then placed his assistant
in the sack tind allowed a sailor to tie
the knot which bound him a fast pris
oner This done, the chief carried the
sack into an open space, warning the
people to stand back some distance,
and then carried on an animated con
ersatiou with his assistant, whose re
plies could be distinctly beard coming
from the sek Suddenly the chief
rushed forward, picked up the sack
and dumped it oerboard, where, to
the horror of the passengers and crew,
it sank out of sight '
Immediately the captain rushed for
ward and seized the man, under the
full belief 'that he had murdered his
companion, but the juggler only
smiled and, pointing to the canas,
asked that it be raised This * was
done, and the supposed drowned man
was discoered squatting on the deck
So realistic had been the throwing
oerboard, howeer, that it was some
time before the surprised passengers
could realize a murder had not been
committed
Church and Workmen
It would be an exaggeration to say
that all working people feel antago
nistic toward the church Their general
attitude is rather that of indifference
The thinking poor are well enough
aware that there is nothing unnatural
in the situation and that if the tables
were so turned that world adantage
shifted to their side it would probably
remain unchanged At times their feel
ing, especially toward the clergy, is cu
riously sympathetic "Say," remarked
a labor leader of iid mind to the
writer— "say, I'm awfully sorry for
ministers Most of them are real good
men They know well enough what
Christ meant, and they'd like first rate
to preach If they dared But, liord,
how can they? They'e got to draw
their salaries; they'e got families to
support" All this quite without a
touch of irony— Vida  Scudder la

A TRUE HERO
One of the Kind That Gets Little
Recognition Here Below
id you eer know a hero real well?
I know at least one and quite intimate
ly Who? I am afraid you would hard
ly recognize his name, and besides it
would not be just right to gie it here
He is only nn old bachelor who works
in a shop lie has been at one bench
for something like— well, from this you
may judgePersonal When he began, he was
fresh from school He lies in a little
frame house, with an absurd little
back yard hardly more than big enough
for the syringa bush aud the ash bar
rel 
"The Qrst morning I started for the
shop," he once told me, "I cut across
the back yard and climbed the fence
I hae been doing It eer since, and it
has been a long tlnie" In the tiny
lawn is worn a deep footpath The top
rail of the back fence is smoothly pol
ished His feet wore the path His
hands polished the rail And all these
years he has worked at the same
bench, doing the same work
Not that he lacks Intelligence or that
he neer had an ambition Intelligence
he most certainly has, no mean lore of
books and a wide, generous grasp of
affairs and the drift of things Ambi
tion he had, too, but that was before
his • feet had worn' a path across the
back yard I am quite sure that he
once loed In fact, I suspect that I
know the one he loed,' and that she
loed him | But he neer married She
did, though she has been widowed for
a dozen years
 But why, you ask, with intelligence
and ambition, did he stick to his
bench? In an upper room of his little
cottage Is a' window blind which is
neer opened Behind that blind, peer
ing out through the shutters with on
recognizing gaze, sits one who bears
the outward form of manhood, yet
lacks manhood's mental qualities The
one behind the blind is his brother
ownstairs, puttering feebty about and
speaking only in high, thin, querulous
tones, is a wan and bent old woman—
his mother For the sake of these two
he has worn the path in the lawn; for
them he put away ambition; for them
he stifled the loe that once stored
within him *
He is past middle age now, thin as to
hair, stooped as to shoulders Yet is
there a tenderness in his oice, a cheer
ful sweetness In his smile, a patient
resignation in his pale blue eyes, that
make his manner of such mild gentle
ness as you might expect in a saint
From him comes neer a word of com
plaint; about him is no trace of dis
appointment, no hint of bitterness
And so, though few know his name,
though he wears no glittering gauds,
though he goes his way unhampered
by pomp or circumstance and all un
recognized by church or state, I can
not help but count him one of earth's
true heroes on't you?— Sewell Ford
in Brandur Magazine Personal
Moses and His Horns
id Moses hae horns? Certainly
not, but if you hae eer had the
pleasure of examining a copy of Mi
chael Angelo's great picture of "The
Lawgier" you hae wondered why
the groat painter surmounted the pa
triarchal face, gray beard and becom
ing priestly gown with a pair of horns
much resembling those of a twoyear
old animal of the boine tribe The
reason Is thisPersonal Jerome's Bible, the
Latin Vulgate, tells that when Moses
came down from the mountain top his
face was "radiant" (rayed) with the
great light shining from his pure soul
In the Greek Septuagint the transla
tion said it was "cornua," meaning
"radiant" Jerome used this later er
sion in making his Latin Vulgate and
translated "cornua" as "cornuta," the
last meaning horned Angelo made
his picture accordingly
Soil Is a Liing Organism
Formerly the soil was regarded as
mineral matter, simply decayed rock
mixed with dead organic matter, says
an exchange Now we know that the
soil is a liing organism whose life
Is as important as that of the animal
or the plant itself If the soil be killed,
it Is absolutely sterile In other words
If the life of organisms which make
soil fertile are destroyed the soil is
Incapable of producing a crop Plants,
as a rule, eat only mineral food, such
as phosphoric acid, potash and nitric
acid, but animals usually eat only or
ganic foods, such as fats, sugars and
protein matter
Ills Case Not So Bad After All
"Ah, It's a sad old world," sighed the
man who had been cheated out of $20
"Tes," assented, his neighbor "One
of my horses got his head fast In the
hayrack last night and broke his neck
I was offered $200 for him less than a
month ago"
"Pshaw! That's too bad Looks as
though It was going to brighten up,
doesn't It?" And he went on his way
whistling cheerfully T Chlcago Record
