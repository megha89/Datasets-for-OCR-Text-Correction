THE SWORFISH
Rome of the Tropical Specie re of
Enormous Size
  queer flsh is the swordfiqh It is
found In the tropical and subtropical
zones of both the eastern and westeri
hemispheres Some of the tropical spe
cies are of enormous size and measure
from, twele to fifteen feet In length,
with at least three feet long
The sword is much the shape of a con
somewhat flattened, the end sharply
pointed, jlt Is smooth on the top and
sides, but the under part Is rough It
is really; an elongation of the bones of
the upper Jaw and is possessed of ery
great strength, for with these weapons
they hae been known to pierce the
copper, sheathing of essels and heay
plates and timbers; but, although thej
can drie the sword far Into these sub
stances, they cannot draw them out, so
break them off and swim away with
out them
JjrS^fln extends nearly the length
oftlieback of the creature, which ig
folded back ; when the flsh is swim
ming in order that its progress may not
be Impeded if speed is desired, but
when quietly swimming it is often
erected and acts as a sail to carry it
through tlie water The swordflsh U
ery aggressie in its disposition and
will often assail flsh much larger than
itself Een the whale is not exempt
from its attacks The food of the
swordflsh consists of smaller flsh,
which it kills by stabbing them with
its sword There is quite a large busi
ness done in swordflshing, as the flesh
is used for food The larger speciea
are caught by harpoonidg, the smaller

arid udley Field Was Een Worse
Than Horace Greeley
No compositor could set aid ud
ley Field's "copy" They" tried It In
seeral large law printing offices in
New York city, but inariably Mr
Field's manuscript was returned to
him for interpretation His chirogra
phy was something wretched Com
pared with it, Horace Greeley's screeds
were copperplate In the line of un
intelligible "curlycues" the great jurist
could gie the great editor "cards and
spades"
Mr Field neer wrote at a desk
while in his office He had a green
baize coered little slab screwed to the
arm of his reoling chair, and on this
he would write for hours at a time
He turned out "copy" quickly, but
days often elapsed before his writings
could be put in tbe hands of the print
er They bad to be copied, and all
hands in the office took turns at help
Ing to decipher them Often copies of
Mr Field's briefs had to be returned
to him with spaces left for words, and
sometimes whole sentences, to be filled
In by himself Then he would wax
wroth and declare his writing was as
plain as day
Especially when working on his hob
by, codification, Mr Field's ideas came
too fast for legible transmission to pa
per, and the result was a chaotic ap
pearing mass of characters most be
wildering to the unfortunate copyist
Tricky Lions
Some of tbe most dangerous tricks of
animals are those of simulating kind
ness Charles Montague In "Tales of
a Nomad" says that hyenaja often fol
low lions and finish a carcass the mo
ment the lions hae left It ! Sometimes,
howeer, the hyenas are too eager and
steal bits of meat while the lions are
still at their meal \
"I hae been told that the lion rids
himself of the nuisance in the follow
ing wayPersonal He throws a piece of meat
aside When the lion is looking the
other way the hyena dodges in and
rushes off with the meat Presently
the lion throws another piece of meat,
this time a little nearer The hyena
takes that also t last the lion throws
a piece ery near Indeed The hyena,
haing become reckless, makes a dash
at this also, but the lion wheels round
and lays him low with a pat of his
paw and a growl of annoyance,"

abled for some time, but In 1813 he
was in actie serice again, and when
Wellington's army crossed the frontier
into France he performed what was in
deed the most amazing feat of his ca

, When ridin#, with no comrade but
the famous Sir Henry Smith, separated
from his column, he saw 00 French
soldiers passing along a raine below
him "The only way was to put a

"So I went up to them, desiring them

Forms of a isease Propagated by a
Minute Gallfly
The little brown balls popularly
known as "oak apples," which may of
ten be seen growing in clusters upon
oak twigs, are not fruit, as some sup
pose, but forms of a disease which re
sults from the attacks of a minute
Jtllfly (cynlps) This little insect, a
distant cousin of wasps and bees, is
proided with a complicated piercing
oipositor in her tall, by means ol
which she makes little holes in the
tender shoots of the oak, laying an egg
in each, and at the same time introduc
ing a drop of Irritant fluid
The substance of the shoot is thus
stimulated to unnatural growth and
produces an oak apple or "gall," which
may be regarded as a sort of egetable
tumor and seres as a home for the
grub, which hatches out of the egg
This' can easily be seen by cutting
open a young gall, but in an old one
the Insect has escaped by driing a
tunnel to the outside
The oak Is infested by many other
kinds of gall Some are tufted, oth
ers look like currants, and others again
are the little brown "oak spangles"
seen on tbe undersides of the leaes
Each kind of gallfly leads to the pro
duction of a different kind of gall—

golden yellow, glossy black or spotted
brown, often with a rose tinted collar
Their bowers are In no sense nests,
but miniature gardens, adapted for en
joyment and courtship and set in the
eye of the sun  paement of equal
sized pebbles is arranged, and number
less twigs are thrust firmly between
them In two parallel rows, Inclined to
each other, inclosing an aenue about
a yard long and seeral inches wide
To decorate this arbor gay feathers,
ruddy berries, pearly shells, bleached
bones, een watches, knies and other
glittering objects, are tastefully placed
In and around the entrance
The New Guinea bird, still more of a
gardener, constructs a miniature conical
summer house, with internal gallery
Before this is a meadow of moss, kept
free from grass, dust and leaes, on
which bright flowers and fruit are dal

 LEGISLTIVE RECOR
"The Echo, firmly belieing that the
reelection of the Hon C H McKenney
to the assembly will be for the best
interests of this community, this coun
ty, and this, the eleenth assembly
district, shall support ' McKenney
His record,' made at tl hist session, is
an eniable one He stands for the in
terests of his district lirt last, and all
the time He did not allow himself to
become entangled with any question
able legislation, and introduced and se
cured in haing passed some bills which
were for the great betterment of the
conditions politically
' "Chief among these was the salary
law, granting salaries to the constables
and justices of tho peace Under the
operation of that law the people hae
ample and continuous poHce protection,
and the constables aro not forced to be
out of reach when needed, because
they must needs go out to earn a liing
for their families
The aboe from a professedly dem
ocratic paper, is circulating the
rounds of the republican press of
this assembly district The Ledger
is a republican paper, and cheerfully
gies place to the article, but wishes
it distinctly understood that it does
not iudorse the statements therein
contained We hae been in the
newspaper business long enough to
know with what eagerness a sendoff
by a paper of the opposite political
faith is tossed around the circle by
the aerage politician as an eidence
of popularity and public confidence
The "Ledger would be pleased to join
in the anthem of praise if it were
able to do so honestly and conscien
tiously, but this it cannot do It
may be that C H McKeuney will
hae' no opponent in this assembly
district That is the policy mapped
out by the programmers, but
whether it is carried to success or
not, the Ledger deems it a solemn
duty it owes to the people to say
that the record of the assemblyman
in the last legislature is far from
commendable Personally, we hae
nothing to say against Mr Mc
Kenney  public serant must be
judged by his record as such Our
cotemporaries claim to adocate his
reelection because of the record
he has cared out The Ledger on
the other hand is impelled to with
hold support because of that record
The allimportant point therefore is
to present the record Our cotem
poraries point to the justice salary
bill as a point in faor Unfortun
ate allusion! That bill is the ery
acme of legislatie degradation
It was conceied in iniquity, haing
for its sole object the striking down
of one of the most sacred safeguards
of the taxpayers enthroned in the
constitution, namely, that no in
crease of salary or compensation
shall be made after an officer's elec
tion or during his term of office
The salary bill was introduced and
passed, and fought through the
courts for no other purpose than to
proide an increase of compensation
The extract froaa our cotemporary
plainly admits this nd for this
perfidy— this open reolt against the
fundamental law — the oters are
asked to reward him by reelection
Let those who can swallow such
arguments, we cannot Inasmuch
as the record generally of C H Mc
Kenney has been brought into the
discussion as a point in his behalf,
we hae taken the trouble to look
oer the assembly journal,  and
segregate therefrom all the bills
introduced by Mr McKenney in
the last legislature, and the dis
position made of the same, We ask
a careful reading of this list Is
there one in the entire list that
tended in any way to the betterment
of political conditions or the relief
of the people generally? The record
is as followsPersonal ';

THE TX LEVY
For the sake of comparison we
herewith present the tax ley for
state and county purposes for the
past two yearsPersonal
• 1903 190
State 561 535
Hospital 17 17
Current expense 519 525
School fund 32 '32
Road fund 33 35
Special road fund 10
Total $200 $190
The total assessment roll for 1903
was $,918,908 and for 190 $5,160,
016, showing an increase for the
current year of $11,108 It will be
interesting to show the amount
raised for the arious local funds by
the tax ley for the two j'ears This
foots up as followsPersonal
1903 190
Hospital $8162 $ 8772
Current expense 229 27190
School 15739 16512
Roads 2218 18060
$7078 $703
From this it will be seen that not
withstanding the reduced ley for
road purposes of 8 cents, by the
wiping out of the special road tax!
the amount that will be raised for
local goernment falls only $ short
of the amount raised by property
tax last year The sweeping away
of the special road tax is a cause for
congratulation It is hoped that it
will neer again be resorted to in
mador county We hae had an
experience of this ley for many
consecutie years, and while it can
not be denied that the main roads
hae shown some improement by
reason of this special expenditure,, it
must be admitted that the improe
ment is not such as to justify a con
tinuance of this lax But that
which will strike the mador tax
payers from the aboe showing is
that all departments of the local
goernment are on the upgrade in
the matter of running expenses
Increase of the assessment roll
brings no relief in the shape of re
duced leies Many will ask, why
is this? The change in the mode of
compensation of township officers
from fees to salaries will account for
the additional amount required in
the current expense fund this year
That explanation, howeer, does not
explain The question still remainsPersonal
How comes it that almost eery
change made hi the laws touching
mador county is in the direction of
piling up additional burdens upon
the people? Is it not high time to
take a different tack? Is there no
room to display statesmanship in
the reduction of goernmental ex
penses? The truth is, situated as
mador county is, the tax rate ought
not to exceed, with a proper reision
of our reenue laws, $150 on the
$100, een with the assessment roll
as it now stands We are free to
say that eery dollar paid by the
property owners oer and aboe
that rate, is a tribute to illdigested
laws Eery boost of the assess
ment roll amounts to a deeper die
into the pockets of the property
holders It may be that other coun
ties are passing through the same
unwholesome experience It may be
also true that the state goernment
is also afflicted with the same disease
of extraagance and misadjusted
laws But een so, this tends to
make the situation all the more
serious

RITCHEY
Ritchey, Sept 10
On, "labor day" ,we breakfasted
early, and then in our comfortable
buggy we droe to the picnic grounds
near Sutter ' rried there quite
early, but found our genial Stony Creek
neighbors there "in force"' before us
The usual amount of gay bunting and
flags gae the groe a festie appear
ance, while it seemed that at least one
man out of oer three sported a
gorgeous \Y i f M badge The
band played, and Mrs Lewis, orator
of the day, was duly presented, and
proceeded to ery fluently harangue
the assembled multitude on the hard
ships and wrongs, and the down
trodden state of the miners In force
ful, bitter words she painted the out
rages of the deportation of the Colo
rado miners and their agonized wies
and children until oer those listening
a cloud seemed to gather, shutting out
the beauty and the brightness of the
day • Personally, we hae neer been
able to find any authority under any
law, either national \or interstate,
authorizing the deportation of crim
inals or persons whom the authorities
feared might commit some criminal
act, from one commonwealth to an
other to be turned loose, there to men
ace the peace of that commonwealth
But still it seemed to us that one rous
ing, cheerful song, full of hope and
faith and courage, would hae done
more to brighten the lies of the
miners than all the word painting of
wrongs that could be presented by each
and eery person with the giftof speech
Granted that the miner's life is one
perpetual risk, his work room cramped,
the air foul, the light "dim id he
not oluntarily adopt that calling
with its short hours and sure pay?
Taken as a class, miners are men of
brawn Then why, if they are not sat
isfied, do they not do something else
There is land in plenty that our Uncle
Samuel wants to gie away to just such
men; men of muscle who could if they
would turn farmer, and work sixteen
or eighteen hours a day for home, for
health, for sunshine, rain, and fresh
air and independence h! Those long
hours of work! Work with brain and
muscle! "There's the rub" But the
price is gladly paid by those who hae
inherited the spirit of the Pilgrim
Fathers and the reolutionary heroes
Blessed life, free from the petty rial
ries of crowded cities, free from the
stifling smoke of factories, from the
hellish' influence of the disreputable
saloon Close to stern, grand, just
beautiful nature, and within easy
reach through books of the highest,
purest, and best thought that old earth
has eer produced
There are always two sides, some
times more, to eery question, but I
hae yet 16 hear the orator for any
union who, as it were, turns the canas
and shows the picture of the millions
of dollars inested in deelopment work
from which no diidends aro reaped,
of the millions in specie paid out
monthly to the miners, of the impos
sibility for small capital to carry on
these great works None of us are
perfect Each is mutually dependent
on the othor Tho situation is in no
way beuefitted or bettered by passion
ate "demands" What is needed is
dispassionate consideration by each
side of a controersy of the rights of
the other side Therefore it seems to
us that the stirring up of men's pas
sions, tho iteration and reiteration of
their wrongs only seres to retard the
coming of tho day for which ; we long
 thought keeps recurring to our
minds It is thisPersonal Those speakers and
grand officers are handsomely paid in
the hard earned dollars of "union men"
for talking, and they might fall into
disuse if men's passions were calmed
instead of being roused
The blue rock shooting we enjoyed
There was an exhiliration in seeing tho
contestants oxhibit their nore and
skill
The ball gamo too we enjoyed, all
except the ugly display of temper by
the Jackson's when San ndreas did
some really fine playing It was worth
going to the picnic just to see tho
equanimity of San ndreas both in the
hope of ictory and in the face of de
feat They may not play ball well in
San ndreas, but her sons know how
to be gentlemen oen in defeat

The Standard Electric Company has
a large force of men at work widening

places a geat deal of work will hae

road is now this machinery could not
be hauled oer it The heay pieces
will require between 30 and 0 auimals
to moe, and such a number could not

road has heretoforo existed Thero is

Jackson Sunday eening en route from
Tuolumne county to mador City It
is reported that they were nonunion
miners, bound for the Fremont mine,
seeking employment They were on
the road on their own account, and
not under engagement It seems that
the union men in mador City got
wind of their intentions, and as soon as
they arried in that town they were
corralled and persuaded to leae the
county, their traeling expenses being
paid The truth is, there was no de
mand for miners at the Fremont, and
they would not hae found employ
ment if they had applied
The Morrow Case
The Methodist conference in session
at Pa< ilic Groe last week, took up the
case of K^, F  Morrow The re
erend gentleman was pastor of the
Jackson church for the year ending
September, 1902 He was then sent to
ntioch, in Contra Costa county fter
exercising the ministerial function in
that charge for a few, months, he left
there and returned to Jackson, and
has been a resident^of this town eer
since, although not engaged in the
actie work of the ministry The Re
J H Van Vliet succeeded him as
pastor of the Jackson charge Friction
and dissension soon arose, which seri
ously impaired the church work
When Re J W Phelps was sent
here last year, church matters were at
a pretty low ebb Under his firm
guidance the affairs picked up The
scandalous letters next appeared, and
has created a bitter feeling eer since
The authorship of those letters has
neer been definitely settled Steps
weru taken to hae them made the sub
ject of criminal prosecution, but noth
ing was done in that direction The
community has been diided in senti
ment, but the church members and
congregation werePersonal almost a unit in
support of the pastor, r Phelps Tho
effort to diide the church, and to
alienate support from the pastor was
traceable throughout, and instead of
accomplishing this it had the opposite
effect, namely, to consolidate the
church, and draw support to the pastor
from the outside Practically a new
church has been built and paid for
during the year, and the pastor's sal
ary raised without any trouble; not
withstanding the ministerial pathway
was made as unpleasant as possible
The name of Morrow was more or less
coupled with the trouble, and on this
a keen and bitter partisan feeling was
engendered The letters hae been
the cause of inestigation by a fraternal
organization, by officers of the United
States and local goernment, and by
the church officials, but nothing de
cisie was accomplished
On the assembling of conference the
Re J W Phelps went to Pacific
Groe, determined to hae the affair
fully entilated He presented formal
charges agaiust the Re Morrow,
which included indulgence in liquor,
un truthfulness, immoral" conduct, and
sowing dissension in the church The
Re Morrow went to Pacific Groe a
few dajra befprtj fhg conference opened,
determined, as it was said, to fight the
charges against his character He
was asked to resign as the easiest way
out of the trouble Of course a re
ligious body is aerse to, airing a scan
dal if it can be aoided The accused
clergyman refused to resign, and in
ited a trial No formal charges were
Sled against him, but a committee of
fifteen ministerial brethren was ap
pointed to make a preliminary inesti
gation, and report to conference as to
the probable (;y,uso qf action against the
accused Thirteen witnesses? were ex
amined, including four from Sacra
mento, touching matters that occurred
at Oak Park during the pastorate 'of
Re Morrow there fter a hearing
the committee reported unanimously
in faor of proceeding with a j regular
aud formal trial on the charges pre
ferred There was some talk of a de
sire to hae the trial in Jackson
Finally the accused minister decided
to resign as a clergyman and a mem
ber of the Methodist church, and
thereupon it is hoped this whole affair
has been brought to an end, on the
understanding that all reference to the
charges preferred should be expunged
from the records of the conference,
the only minute being f,hat the
Re F  Morrow resigned from the
ministry and the church The presi
dent of the conference, Re  Wilson,
wound up the sensation with the sig
nificant remark, directed personally to
the accusod, "You are' getting off
mighty luckily; you are, getting off
mighty luckily" This trial and its
outcome has been the main topic of
conersation in Jackson for the past
week

of carrying the sLaft 200 or 300 feet
deeper, thereby proiding for the open
ing up of three more leels, and ex
ploring the ore body at those points
This sinking will take three or four
months to complete It is hoped to be
able to run one half the stamps during
that time, but this is by no means cer
tain Should the ore body maintain its
size and quality at the greater depth,
there is no doubt that a new shaft ' will
thereupon be undertaken, and the
property operated on a larger scale

a cost of from $15,000 to $20,000

him to the eonclusiQn that the regis

was also decided to send out postal
cards to all persons who had failed to
register, notifying them of the neces
sity of getting on the great register on
or before the 28th of September in
order to ote There seem 9to be an
unparalleled apathy in the matter of

The Railroad
It is reported that a change has rr
cently taken place in the management
of iho lone and Eastern Railroad
project The rumor is that Mr
Erickson, the contractor, has become
a large purchaser in the enterprise,
ami will control it hereafter There
are about 100 men at work at present
Tnis number is not sufficient to com
plete the road to Martell's by January ]
It is said, howeer, that the employes
will be largely reinforced in a few days;
that as many as 500 men will be em
ployed, and the work pushed to com
pletion aa soon as possible Messrs
Erickson and Records took a trip to
Volcano and beyond early this week,
in company with Geo Yager The
object was to look into tho feasibility,
from a financial iew point, of extend
ing the line to the timber belt We
understand the extension is faorably
thought ofPersonal that the resources of the
eastern section in timber, minerals and
agricultural possibilities, are deemed
ample to justify the extension So it
is not unlikely that the upper country
will be tapped by a railroad much
sooner than many people anticipate
It is still the general impression that
the Southern Pacific is the moing
power behind this railroad extension
project Contractor Erickson has been
prominently identified as a contractor
for the Southern Pacific fter a
careful inestigation he is satisfied that
the enterprise holds out eery pros
pect of being a profitable one, and
hence has shown his willingness to
inest

Jemmy was explaining to meliaPersonal
"This is the way you niako a hortus
slccusPersonal You get a big book with no
printin' in it, and then paste It full of
weeds and powers and grass and little
liits of bushes, but you hae to dry,
dry, dry '0111 Siccus is Latin for just
us dry as a bone"
"I wonder could we put in Benjamin
Byram; Esq?" Bess speculated plaln
liely "Ileuun knows he's dry
enough just as he stands Then think
of the relief if he was once where
you could shut him up and off at will"
True giggled outright "lie does talk
thirteen to the dozen," she said "But
who wouldn't, with all his chances?
Nature made him a fool of the first wa
ter, and fate chipped in by ghrlrig
him a fortune and a doting family"
"Benjamin the Blatant, Tom Rod
man calls him," Bess begau, still plain
tie Jemmy came charging at her,
with melia hot upon his heels, and
shoutingPersonal "You hush unty Bess! You
wanter lose mo niy pony! Mister By
ram says he'll gie me a Shetland If I
don't let nobody say a word against
him in this house"
"I b'leee he wants Jem to fight with
Mister Tom Rodman," melia inter
rupted sagely, her head the least bit
aside "nd I ain't goin' to help him
there," she, added pointedly, '"cause
Mister Tom says I'm his sweetheart
He's goin' to wait for me to grow up
He thinks I'm a heap prettier'n unty
Bess right now"
"How about me?" I'rue asked, gig
gling more than eer melia looked
reflectiely, but Jemmy stuck his hands
In his pockets, set his feet far apart
and said, sticking out his chin after
the manner of his model, Benjamin
Byram, "Why, Prudy, you know no
body will eer look at you so long as
unty_ Bess and Melia are around"
"Won't they, iudced?" I'rue queried,
drawing down the corners of her
mouth meekly, although her eyes twin
kled  Jemmy swung on his heel, say
ing magisteriallyPersonal "Course not Why,
you're all freckled same as a turkey
egg and haen't hardly got meat
enough to wrap up your long bones"
"Upon my soul! Say, Miss Prue,
shall I take him out and drown him?"
Tom liodmau asked, coming through
the door as ho spoke But Jemmy only
grinned at him— Jemmy was nine and
Prue eighteen They were the best of
comrades, despite his brutal frankness
True made a dash at him, stood him
upon his head, then swung him by an
arm and a leg, chantingPersonal
"Here he goes! Fingers and toes!
Up the chimney when the wind blows!"
ending" in a feint of flinging' Jemmy
upon the open fire melia improed
the opportunity to pull her brother's
hair until he howled They were twins
and pretty badly spoiled, as was but
natural, since they had grown up moth
erless i their grandfather's house
"I'll swing you by your legs, Prudy,
when I'm a man You see if I don't,"
Jemmy said, trying to scowl, but grin
ning in spite of himself Tom Rod
man picked the boy up and flung him
across his shoulder, saying graelyPersonal "I
hate to do it, but there's nothing else
for it Jemmy, I'e been telling you
this eer so long I'd carry you to the
gypsies if you did not behae better
Stop wriggling You can't get away
But I'll let you kiss Melia and the
others goodby Be quick! You won't
eer see them again"
"Kiss 'em all yourself That's what
you're after," Jemmy, the astute, piped
huskily as Tom carried him close to
unty Bess His ami were free
Impishly he laid hold of the two heads
and yanked them together, locking his
arms behind the two necks and hold
ing them tight, laughing uproariously
all the while Tom was a gallant fel
low, lie could do no less than kiss
Bess, if all his heart did belong to
sweet Miss Prue  nd just as he kiss
ed her who should come in to them
but Mr Byram, the rich distant cousin,
who had been for three weeks a guest
at Fairlaw
Mr Byram had come there exploring
He felt the need of a wife rather than
the want of one Bess, who was tall
and twenty and the ery moral of gra
cious Btateliness when she chose to be,
had captiated him out of hand He
would hae proposed to her the second
day of his isit, neer doubting what
answer she would make, but that his
Bense of propriety forbade Besides, it
would not do to dazzle her too sudden
ly He must let the great' prospects
break gently upon her as dawn broke
oer the world So he had been nobly
impartial in his deoirs, so much so be
had twinges of conscience wheneer he
thought of Prue She was hardly more
than a schoolgirl, to be sure, but quite
mature enough to break her heart oer
loss of him if she once let herself seri
ously beliee she had a chance of being
Sirs Byram
Of Tom Rodman he had taken no
more account than to set him down as
an impertinent puppy, with a knack of
coming in at all hours, especially when
Mr Byram least expected or wanted
him To discoer him kissing Bess in
the face of eerybody made Benjamin
the Blatant simply furious ll the
more furious that Jemmy cried out
gleefullyPersonal "Mister Byram! Mister By
ram! Come help me hold 'em! They
tried to skeer me, but I'm beatin' 'em
at their own game!"
"Let loose, you little armint! Shut
up!" Tom commanded Prue made a
dash at the tangle and deftly untwined
Jemmy's fingers, letting Bess escape
Mr Byram stood speechless in wrath

marries me, and the Faillies always
kiss their kinfolk, if they ain't too far
off nud great big stuffs into tbe bar
gain Prue and unty Bess said so
the first night you came"
"Indeed!" Mr Byram exploded
"With my coming, I suppose, for a
text Well, young ladies, I see in all this
the hand of Proidence  just and
eer watchful God would not permit
me to fall ictim to your mercenary
designs No doubt you were tempted
by my wealth and position, although
you are so wholly incapable of appre
ciating a man of my character" —
"Kindly come outside with me be
fore you say any more," Tom Rodman
interrupted, setting Jemmy down with
a thump and putting himself in front
of Bess, who had grown ery white
and had eyes' of scorching flame Prue,
coutrarywlse, had flushed so scarlet it
hid all her freckles Tom reached a
hand to her and drew her toward him,
while he went on steadilyPersonal "Your talk
needs a man to hear and answer it
I'm that man Bess and Prue hae no
brother, and Mr Fairlie is past fighting
age But Prue belongs to me, and that
gies me the right to stand up for 'em
So you come along! We'll settle this
the minute we strike the turnpike and
neutral ground"
"Hush, Tom! Remember he's our
guest!" Bess pleaded Prue gae her
sweetheart a roguish and heaenly
smile melia looked fit to cry oer
the toppling of her air castle, but Jem
my turned a handspring by way of
showing his Joy in the "melley" s
he came up standing, he stepped i
front of Byram, swelled out his chest
nnd said stoutlyPersonal
"on't you try no crawfish games!
You know you wanted to marry unty
Bess! You told me so and said I must
court her for you I ain't ery big,
but if you try to go back on her I'll let
you know I can shoot my little gun,
and that's more than you can do We
won't hae a regular duel, like grand
pa tells about Let's try a buttin'
match instead, and if I butt you oer,
like aid did Goliath, you'll propose
to unty Bess same as eer and gim
me that Shetland you'e been talkln'
so much about"
"Ladies and gentlemen, goodby," Mr
Byram began in his most ceremonious
oice He got no ; further Jemmy
went at him like a catapult and bowled
him down and out of the door, only
stopping when his enemy lay prostrate
upon the hall threshold There the
grownups came to the rescue and so
managed it that Mr Byram went off
an hour later, somewhat bruised in his
person and self esteem, but as to his
outer man whole and speckless When
the carriage rolled away with him Tom
Rodman drew a long breath and said
as he tossed a foreign letter to BessPersonal
"Your sweetheart is coming home by
the next steamer Had a cable this
morning You see, I hae been writing
him things He will agree with me
and the late Byram that in all this
there is unmistakably the hand of
Proidence"
Talent Promptly Recognized
The businesslike young man ap
proached the man at the desk
"I'll ask only a minute of your time,"
he said "I want to know if you
wouldn't like to subscribe for a copy
of this book I'e sold 150 of 'em in
this building in the last three dajs"
The man at the desk took the book
and looked at it He noted its utter
worthlessness from a literary point of
iew, its tawdry binding and the
cheapness of the paper on which it was
printed Then he saidPersonal
"Young man, do you mean to tell me
seriously that you hae sold 150 copies
of that book in this one building?"
"Yes, sir Here's my order book
You can look at the signatures yourself
Eery one of them is genuine"
"I see Young fellow, I don't know
how much you are making out of this
business, but I'll gie you twice as
much, whateer it is, if you'll take hold
of a patent nose ring I was fool enough
to drop a lot of money in a few years
ago and help me to dispose of a stock
of 2,000 dozeu of 'em I'e still got on
hand"— Chicago Tribune
Iory Caring In China and Japan
In China and Japan iory has been
cared, the iory balls inclosed inside
one another being specially noted
Many theories hae been formed as to
how these balls hae been cut Per
haps a probable one is that a ball of
iory was taken, around the upper and
lower ends of which four small holes
were cared out, gradually diminishing
in size toward the center until the axis
of the one hole met Ihe axis of the
other or lower one at right angles in
the center of the ball and that then
small tools were inserted and a thin
layer of iory forming a part of a cir
cle from one hole to its lower corre
sponding one was cut and loosened
from the whole mass So, gradually
cutting from one hole to the next one,
a complete inner circle was eentually
loosened, the circles themseles after
ward being cut into the required pat
tern—Chambers' Journal
The ictionary Hniilt
"Yes, it's a good thing for a man to
refer to the dictionary, but this prac
tice can often be carried to excess,"
said a well known magazine writer
"Why, I'e seen a man get so much
addicted to this habit," he continued,
"that he could not write an ordinary
letter without turning to the dictionary
three or four times in order to ascer
tain some big words that he could use
This, I think, is a ery great waste of
time, as he does not express his mean
ing a bit better than if he had
used some shorter and really English
words"

CRETN LEPERS
Their Numbers re Swelled by Thrf
Food and Their Filth
In the small island of Crete leprosy
Is shockingly prealent The Cretans
hae themseles to thank' for this state
of affairs The houses may be pretty
and whitewashed on the outside, but
within the filth Is fearful nd the
food they eat la just what eacourages
leprosy  The Greek forbids meat about
200 days out of the year, so as good
Christians they must lie on salt flsh,
which Is not improed by Its long
Journey from northern seas to southern
heat The olie oil Is o plentiful—
they export 20,000 tons each year— that
they use It to excess, een adding it to
the milk of a rice pudding But the
crowning eil Is pork, the faorite fare
of the Cretans on days when the
church allows them to eat meat The
leper is not cut off here as he is In the
Fijslands or at the Cape Outside
each illage may be seen a little white
house called the "leprochorion" Here
the lepers lie Their estates, if they
hae any, are administered for them
by friends, nnd any one passing by the
door may speak to them If the suf
ferers be poor the state proides each
day a loaf of bread, and the charity
of passersby adds the luxuries— New
York Herald
THE PRIMITIVE STGE
How tbe rama Flourished Ib the
Time of Elizabeth
The great plays of Marlowe, Shake
speare and Jonson were performed by
actors in Elizabethan dress in front of
a curtain, usually in daylight, on a lit
tle stage partly occupied by the gal
lants of the period, with their pages
and tobacco pipes There was no fash
ionable actress, no orchestra, no lime
light, yet the drama was more popu
lar than churchgoing and held Its own
een with such gentle sports as bull
baiting and "wiping of the ' blind
beare" The little that we know of
the actors shows them, with the excep
tion of Burbage and Nathaniel Field, to
hae been ery ordinary workaday
people, with empty pockets and domes
tic affections and other modern charac
teristics Yet the protests of the I"uri
tans, the aaricious records of the
censor and the continual erection of
new theaters In spite of the solemn
threats of the city fathers are eidence
enough of the marelous popularity to
which the art attained in that "spa
cious time" of playhouses most re
markable for lack of space— London

OIL ON THE WTER
Its Soothing; Effect Was Known as
Early as the Sixth Century
 few gallons of oil cast upon stormy
seas moderates their iolence and pre
ents the waes from breaking with
force That this is the case has long
been known Theophylactes, the By
zantine historian of the sixth century,
propounded tKe question, "Why does
oil calm the sea?" and answered it to
the effect that as the wind is a subtle
and delicate thing and oil is adhesie
end unctuous the wind glides oer the
surface of the water on which oil has
been spread and cannot raise waes
The wind, in fact, slips oer the water
without being able to obtain a grip
In the gulf of Mexico there is a re
markable stretch of water about two
miles long by threequarters of a mile
broad to which the name of "oil spot"
has been gien because in the worst of
storms the mariner finds still water
there
Its character as a safe harbor of ref
uge is said to be due to an oily proper
ty of the mud stirred up by the storm
Pern's Whistling Jars
mong the ruined cities of ' Pern
nearly fifty different kinds of musical
Instruments hae been found Unique
among these are many double whis
tling Jars or musical water bottles
Near the top of the first or front jar,
which is usually surmounted by a hu
man or animal figure, is the opening of
the whistle When the jars hae been
partly filled and are swung backward
and forward a number of whistling
sounds are produced s the essel
swings forward and upward the water
Is lowered in the first jar and rises In
the other In the backward motion it
rushes back into the flrst, forcing the
air out through the whistle
Caatoma In Mongolia
Tea, with an admixture of salt and
mutton grease Is the common beerage
In Mongolia It is not recommenda Personal
ble Snuff taking is uniersal, and
the offer of the snuff bottle is the gen
eral method of greeting Mongols ap
pear to seclude their women in some
measure, at least, from strangers, and
a traeler's arrial is usually the sig
nal for a hasty departure of the ladies
of the family for the tents of their
next neighbors
