EXERCISE AN EATING
Remember That a Tired Stomach la
a 'Weak Stomach
A good dinner at night is necessary
for those whose pleasure or work keeps
them up ery late But for ordinary
folk who dine at 6 or 7 and go to bed
about 10Personal30 onjy a light wholesome re
past should be taken at the end of the
day, when muscles and neres are
more or less exhausted j'
A "tired stomach Is a weak stomach"
Is a golden rule to remember Yet how
often one hears people say, "I'e been
rushing about all day and am tired to
death; I must hae a big meal to make
up for it!" You may put the big meal
into the stomach, but you cannot make
the stomach digest it
A belief lies strong in the hearts and
minds of the majority of mankind, in
cluding persons of weak digestions,
that a quick, brisk walk taken before
a' meal gets up an appetite and helps
the stomach to digest the food Now,
this Is exactly what it doesn't do Ex
ercise spreads the blood throughout the
body For the proper digestion of food
the blood is needed in the stomach
Few realize this important fact
After a long, exhausting walk, bicy
cle spin or any seere physical or men
tal strain take a good half hour's rest
in a comfortable armchair or lying on a
sofa before you eat a substantial meal
A Telephone Whlatle
When the earpiece of a telephone re
ceier is held to the mouthpiece of the
transmitter, a more or" less shrill tone
or whistle-is heard in the receier This
occurs when the apparatus is in good
working condition and when the trans
mitter is on short circuit This effect
is seemingly due to a series of reactions
analogous to but much more complex
than those which occur in an electric
bell when its circuit is closed A moe
ment of the diaphragm of the receier
toward its magnet tends to weaken the
pressure on the carbon of the transmit
ter, which causes a weakening of the
current, allowing the diaphragm to fall
away, with the further result that the
air column is compressed, increasing
the pressure on the carbon again and
also increasing current strength, where
by the diaphragm in again attracted,
and this action is repeated oer and
oer again— Gassier'B Magazine
Oriental Hgrn
"Oriental rugs," says a New York
dealer, "are nearly as standard as gold
When an auctioneer sells you one for
$200, you may think you are getting It
cheap, but you can get it at about the
same price from any reputable dealer
Eery rug house has its agents at auc
tions, who pay mighty close to the mar
ket price for the genuine article When
you hae had an oriental rug for ten or
fifteen years, it Is worth more than
when you bought it, proided it Is in
good condition It Is then an antique
When you hear of any one buying sec
ondhand oriental rugs at about one
third or one-quarter of their alue, you
may safely wager that they hae been
patched"
Theology aa He Understood It
Passengers in an uptown car one aft
ernoon last week were ery much en
tertained and amused by a discussion
of things spiritual by two colored pas
sengers As the debate waxed warmer
the oices of the debaters grew louder
until what was said was plainly audi
ble to all in the car After each had
made a confession of faltb and gien
his iews of the means whereby mortal
man could gain salation one of the
pair blurted out in a tone that implied
that all his hope for the next world
was embodied In the wordsPersonal
"Well, sah, I b'llee dat what* s gwine

The Limit
"And the railway company agrees to
settle by paying me $5,000, does it?"
said the man who had been injured
"How much of it do I get?"
"You get all of it," said the lawyer,
"and jam pay me what you please It
didn't take me fie minutes to get a
settlement out of them"

TWO MEN AN A MORAL
An Incident That Suypllea Consider
able Food For Thought
These ought ye to do and not to leae the
Others undone
A pale young man *t down on a
bench in the park He imt a torn bag
Of tools under the bench
A small, red faced man came behind
him He stooped to steal the bug
The pale man turned and said in a
slow, tired wayPersonal "rop that It ain't
worth stealing"
The ruddy man said, "Not if you're
lookin'"
The pale man set tbe bag at his feet
and saidPersonal
"It's a poor business you're in"
"You don't look as if yours was any
better" He sat down "What's your
callin'?"
"I'm an ironworker; bridge work"
"on't look strong enough"
"That's so I'm just out of the hos
pital; got hurt three months ago"
"I'm just out of hospital, too," he
grinned 
"What hospital?"
"Sing Sing"
"What? Jail?"
"Yes; not bad in winter, either
There's a society helps a fellow after
you quit that hospital Gies you good
clothes too"
"Clothes? Is that so?"
"Gets you work" —
"Work— good God! I wish they'd get
me some"
"You ain't bad enough Go and grab
some thin Get a short sentence; first
crime Come out and get looked after
by nice ladles"
"My God!"
"idn't they do nothin* for you when
you got out of that hospital?"
"No! Why the deil should they? I'm
only an honest mechanic Are you go
in'?"
"Yes I'e got to go after that job
It'll gie me time to look about me
Gosh, but you look bad! Goodby"
The ruddy man rose, looked back,
jingled the few coins in his pocket hes
itated and walked away whistling
The pale man sat still on the bench,
staring down at the ragged bag of tools
at his feet— r Weir Mitchell in Cen

SOME WRITERS
Button wrote in lace ruffles and Alex

Personal Milton composed his "Paradls* Lost"
on a large armchair, with his head

Bret Harte's first literary success
was a little book called "Condensed
Noels," In which he parodied some
prominent noelists of the day
Austin obsln, the poet, wanted in
early life to be an engineer and was
preparing for that profession when his
parents persuaded him to enter the
ciil serice
When Fox had eaten heartily, he
would retire to his study, enelop his
bead in a napkin soaked in inegar and
water and work sometimes ten hours
in succession
Allison Is said to hae consumed
twenty-four years in the preparation of
his "History of Europe," but many im
portant literary enterprises were also
carried on by him during this time
It is related of Hall Came, the noel

A College Han and a Quotation
Some one once said, "A Harard man
knows all literature but the Bible," a
startllngly sweeping generality, but
not without truth so far as the Bible is
concerned A case in point came to
light the other day Two Harard men
were reading together some famous
modern orations, one of them a eulogy
The eulogy closed with the wordsPersonal "O
death, where is thy sting? O grae,
where is thy ictory?"
"What a beautiful close!" exclaimed
one of the students enthusiastically
"The man who wrote such a sentence
as that proes that the grand style in
prose did not die with the eighteenth
century"
It should be added In fairness that
the other s'-^ent was a churchman
and said noi^ug— New York Tribune
"It's the Cat"
An aged country rector who had an
old tailor as his clerk, returning from
his church one Sunday with the latter,
thus addressed himPersonal
"Thomas, I cannot think how it Is

ner and thinner, for I am sure I preach
as well as eer I did and ought to hae
far more experience than I bad when I
first came among you"
"Indeed," replied Thomas "I'll tell
you what; old parsons nowadays are

as well as eer I did In my life, and the
cloth is the same, but it's the cut sir,

HAVE WOMEN INTUITION
One Writer Snya They Hae Neer
Shown It In Literature
Literature is the final expression of
human thought If women can  lay
claim to a special faculty of intuition,
why do they not manifest it in _ their
writings? Intuition, if It means any
thing, means the faculty that gets
down to the germ of actions and char
acteristics and focuses external traits
Into a central erity recognizable to
the general public Now, there are
more female writers than male No
woman poet has eer written an in
eitable line, a line that flashes spon
taneously out of the unknown and casts
an illuminating light upon the abyss
Woman has added practically nothing
to our stock of familiar quotations
Take down your Bartlett or your an
thology, and you may be surprised to
find tbat from Mrs Browning to Mrs
Meynell women hae neer coined a
phrase which lias passed into the com
mon currency of speech' Mrs Brown
ing has indeed written fine lines, but
nothing of hers can be said to hae be
come a household word
Nor has any woman noelist created
any character that Is generally recog
nized as typical George Eliot has
come closest with her Tito Melema
aud Mrs Poyser You would appeal
only to the educated few if you de
scribed a person as a Tito or a Poyser
But call a man a on Quixote, a
Micawber, a ogberry, a Falstaff, a
Colonel Newcome, a Bilfil, a Parson
Adams or Bob Acres, call a woman a
Mrs Malnprop, a Becky Sharp, a Bea
trice, a iana Vernon, a Meg Merrilies,
and een the illiterate will mentally
classify the indiidual as you wish him
or her to be classified
"Ah, but," you say, "in real life wo
men are tbe true intuitions They size
up a man or a woman at a glance
They, are neer mistaken when they
trust to their instincts"
I can only testify to my own experi
ence I hae not found that women's
snap Judgments of character are im
bued with any special erity They
form likes or dislikes quicker than a
man does because they are quicker on
the trigger of conjecture They can
only be one of two things, right or
wrong If time proes that they 'are
right as they must be in 50 per cent of
cases, the right guess Is remembered
and treasured up by the slower minded
man as an extraordinary Instance of
intuition The wrong guess is forgot

To Sne Tempera and Collars
"You button your collar the wrong
way," said the salesman as he was
selling neckwear to a customer
"How is that?"
"You hae buttoned the right side
last Now, when you go to take it off
you will hae to tug at the end of the
collar and crumple it, because you
can't get a proper hold of it but if you
had the left end on top you could get
it off easily, then loosen tbe collar be

extended in nil directions, but with the
bounds of darkness pushed back step
by step the goal Is not and neer will
be in sight An infinity of objects and

LINCOLN'S ISPATCHES
Why Many of Them Were ated
From the War epartment
Surprise is often expressed by ery
intelligent people that so large a pro
portion of President Lincoln's most im
portant telegrams and some of his let
ters are dated from the war depart
ment Instead of the executie mansion
and none of them from the nay, treas
ury or other administratie bureaus
This is generally deemed a ery singu
lar fact, and from it writers hae
plaustbly^draiji ton conclusion that
Lincoln personally llkMhpJ^s-rretary
of war better than afl»T^ine other
cabinet officers While this Indeed ap
pears to hae been true, It does not nec
essarily so follow He certainly held
Mr Seward In high regard, yet he sel
dom went to the state department
In the circumstances it was not at all
singular The explanation is easy War
was the business of that time, and Lin
coln's eyes were always bent to the
army, especially when great military
eents were impending He habitually
haunted the adjacent war department
and army headquarters, where abode
General Halleck, his military adiser,
for news and iews Head and heart
were strenuously concentrated on the
fight whereer it might be His fertile
brain saw, too, the critical points in the
game oftentimes far more clearly than
pome of his so called "ablest generals"
He not only wished to know what ; was
going on in the field, but performed hla
own part nobly In the heat of action
or at crucial moments his orders,' sug
gestions and inquiries were fired off
spontaneously from whereer he might
be at the moment and at such periods
he was generally "oer at the war de
partment" with Mr Stanton That is
the chief reason why so many of his
dispatches are dated at that depart
ment and not because he perhaps held
Stanton in higher esteem than the sec
retary of the nay or state or treasury"

AN INCENSE PARTY
Odd Etiquette of an Intereatlns; Ja#-
anese Function
If you eer receie an Initation to a
Japanese incense party, accept it
promptly and thankfully It has no
counterpart In our own social system
and is as merry and pleasant an affair
as can be imagined The people of the
mikado's land hae trained the nos
trils for generations the same as ,we
hae trained the eye and ear, and they
display a skill which at times is star
tling to a westerner There is an odd
etiquette to be followed In these social
affairs For the twenty-four hours
preceding the party each guest must
aoid the use of anything which can
produce any odor whateer Scented
Boaps, perfumes, odorous foods and
een spices must be aoided These
preent the user from smelling accu
rately and also Interfere with the other
members of the party 
When you dress, be careful to put on
no garment that has been kept in the
neighborhood of camphor wood, tobac
co, bouquets, dried blossoms or scented
powder "When you reach the house of
your host, enter it as softly as you can
and as slowly as possible This Is to
preent making a draft by the moe
ment of your own body Be equally
leisurely in opening and closing doors,
as a quick moement Induces a sud
den rush of air In the drawing room
the hostess burns a series of incenses,
usually four or fie In number Each
guest la allowed to take three sniffs of
each Incense and must then Jot down
Its name and number upon a card
Each of the four or fie incenses Is
burned two or three times, so that the
number of cards will ary from eight
to fifteen At the end the cards are
laid out on the table, and the hostess
reads the names of the Incenses em
tployed, which are checked off upon
the cards The guest who has guessed
the largest number receies a pretty
prize, which is sometimes a siler or
bronze incense burner, statuette or
caring Among the Japanese the aer
age woman guesses correctly about six

women the ratio is three in ten— New

young lady, with flashing eyes, as she
walked down the aenue with a com

"Nothing, only that you told me that
you had commenced keeping a diary,

We look to the friends of the Ledger to keep
us posted concerning eents of public Interest
happening In any part of the county Our reg
ular correspondents will be furnished with
writing material and stamps tor this purpose
Births, deaths, marriages, accidents, amuse
ments, mining and other Industrial progress,

A NOVEL POLICY
The ispatch desires to publish
all announcements of socials, festi
als, etc, that are going on All
such notices of entertainments will
be published one insertion free, as a
matter of news After once pub
lished the news feature is destroyed,
and subsequent insertions will be
charged for at adertising rates —
ispatch
We find the aboe notice hoisted
at the mast head ot our cotem
porary, as a statement of the policy
pursued by that journal in drawing
the line of demarcation between a
legitimate news item and an ader
tisement It is the most astonish
ing announcement on that proposi
tion that we hae eer seen paraded
in the columns of a newspaper We
do not beliee it can be matched as
a business proposition by any other
country paper in the land It is in
fact a public initation along stara
tion lines It would be amusing in
its erdancy, were it not for the
disgraceful belittlement of a noble
profession which its publication im
plies Pressed to its logical issue,
it means that all future -eents, of
whatsoeer nature, are items of
news to the extent of one insertion,
and as such are entitled to free in
sertion A tax sale, a notice to
creditors in a probate proceeding,
an ordinance of the board of super
isors, in like manner are items of
news, and on that basis should be
gien free publication for one time
That is just an entire transposition
of the rules of the newspaper busi
ness, one of the fundamental princi
ples of which is that the first inser
tion should be charged, for obious
reasons, at a higher rate than sub
sequent insertions Why should a
merchant's announcement of -a 50
per cent reduction sale be regarded
as an adertisement demanding p?,y
at so much per line, and a church
festial to take place in the future,
and at which an admission price is
to be charged, as an item of news
which the publisher is under obliga
tions to scatter broadcast for
nothing What would be thought
of a merchant who would publicly
proclaim that the first order from a
customer would be filled free of
charp?, and only on subseauent
irder would he expect an equia
lent in coin? Suppose all business
men i & town were to adopt the
same rule, how long would the town
as a business center surie the
ordeal? Such a policy would be
nothing less than business suicide
Not one whit less suicidal is the
business item which we cull from
our cotemporary, and which is
flaunted week after week before the
world as a sample of newspaper
wisdom Is it' to be wondered at
that the printing business is un
profitable? No business could be
profitably conducted along similar
lines
The truth is, eery eent in the
future, from the publisher's stand
point, is in the nature of an ader
tisement No newspaper man
should be expected to announce any
kind of entertainment at which an
admission fee is to be charged free
of charge It makes not the slight
est difference whether the proceeds
are to be deoted to church or chari
table purposes or any other object
If, in the opinion of those who are at
the head of the entertainment, its
announcement in the columns of the
local paper would tend to increase
the patronage, they ought to be
willing to pay a fair alue for the
serices rendered When the
columns of the paper are used for
the express purpose of bringing
reenue for any indiidual or organ
ization, the space used for that
object is an adertisement, and
should be paid for, no matter
whether it be used for the first or
the twentieth time
While' this is unquestionably the
correct rule, it has become cus
tomary to relax it under certain
conditions, as the judgment of the
publisher may dictate For in
stance, where the promoters of a
dance or entertainment send pat
ronage in the shape of job print
ing to the office, a short notice
of the forthcoming dance or enter
tainment is published without
charge, as a matter of courtesy
This was the course the Ledger had
followed for years, prior to its sale
by the present editor  J 592 On
resuming control, howeer, last yew_ i
we found a widely different plan pre
ailing ' The local columns are made
the dumping place of free adertis
ing matter, from numerous sources,
and printers are decrying  the
decadence of the business which they
hae helped to debase and destroy
Not only has the adertising patron
age been curtailed, - but the job
printing department has suffered
sympathetically as it were If the
promoters of a festial can get the
same adertised for nothing, as
legitimate news matter, they are
apt to forgo the expense of posters
and other requisites in the printing
line In other words, they depend
entirely on the free adertising
The printer is used to help rake in
the dimes for eery money-raising
scheme that comes along, and he
gets nix for his trouble, j Nay, worse
than this, the standing notice in the
columns of our coteraporary carries
the impression that the editor is
actually the faored party, and
ought to be thankful for an ader
tisement disguised under the label of
"news item, one insertion" The
Ledger is as well able to stand this
pernicious, unbusinesslike method
as its co temporaries But we do
not propose to do so Our cotem
porary can keep his dishonorable
free-trade flag flaunting before the
public if he pleases, but we prefer
the path of self-protection, and will
hereafter draw the blue pencil
through the "free adertisement"
schemes, subject only to the excep
tions herein referred to
A PROTEST FROM CALAVERAS
The Calaeras Prospect of last
week republished the article in the
Ledger of two weeks ago on the sub
ject of itemized bills It admits that
the practice of lumping road bills in
the name of the superisor or road
master of the district has been pre
alent of late in that county, and has
already gien birth to much dissat
isfaction Why the old plan of pre
senting a erified bill for the work
performed or material furnished by
each person has been abandoned in
that county is not stated Prob
ably the only reason is that it was
found much easier to lump the
claims And Amador county ha
ing established the precedent years
ago, it was natural to conclude that
Calaeras bad the same legal right
to do so as Amador The Prospect
article saysPersonal
In Calaeras as the Ledger says,
the published proceedings of the
board show the road bills generally
as lumped to the superisors of the
district or to his road master for the
special section of the road This
course has gien great dissatisfac
tion to the taxpayers who hae no
means of knowing whether the bills
presented hae been properly itemiz
ed or not The law proides for the
publication of the proceedings, pre
sumably for the information of the
taxpayer, but it becomes a question
whether the mere fact that so much
money was paid out, without giing
an itemized report is the legal infor
mation required by law The law is
ery explicit that eery bill shall be
itemized, and how it shall be item
ized, before it can be allowed, and it
may be presumed that the super
isors follow the law in this respect,
otherwise they would be subject to
criminal proceedings under the pro
ision of the law proiding that no
public money shall be paid out ex
cept in accordance with law
But the published minutes do not
show this fact, and the public claim
the right to know that the persons
whose names appear in the minutes
as receiing the money do or not do
the work, and the taxpayers who
pay -for this information claim the
right to know who are the recipi
ents of the, public bounty It is
only recently that this practice of
lumping the bills has been followed,
and like the Ledger the Prospect
would be glad to know the legal
authorization for such a course
THE PRIOR CONVICTIONS
The Stockton dailies, desirous of
correcting the erroneous impression
that had been created by the publi
cation of a statement that the prior
conictions were proed against
Macquarric at his recent trial in
Jackson, published our article in full
explaining the matter The Mail,
howeer, takes the opportunity of
making the following commentPersonal
In this defense of Macquarrie the
Ledger itself acknowledges that he
was conicted in San Francisco
The fact that he was released on
habeas corpus may indicate that he
was not guilty, and it may not so in
dicate Occasionally" habeas corpus
proceedings are brought on the
ground that the eidence was in
sufficient, but generally the point
raised is that there was some defect
in the legal method of procedure
This is hardly fair When a de
fendant is released on habeas corpus
proceedings, after coniction, it
shows that he was not legally con
icted The jury that was called
upon to pass on these prior conic
tions said they were untrue This
conclusion was reached on the
strength of the documentary ei
dence presented to them On this
erdict Macquarrie is entitled to all
presumptions of innocence, the same
as though he had neer been con
icted or accused of the petty
crimes charged

AMENING THE MINING' LAWS
A bill has been introduced in the
senate, which, should it become a
law, would be of benefit to the min
ing industry in that it would dispose
of much litigation caused by the
question of extralaeral rights Tho
bill is to amend the laws relating to
mineral land locations,, and gies
locators the exclusie right to pos
session of all the surface land within
their lines and of all eins, lodes,
etc, throughout the entire depth
which lie within such surface lines,
extending downward ertically
Locations are to be 1,500 feet square
in all cases in which preious loca
tions do not preent The existing
legal proision concerning tunnels is
repealed The present law ia re
gard to location gies an area of
600 to 1,500 feet, but permits ownera
to follow the ein outsid 'be lines
The effect of the prop^s J amend
ment would be to exte_fi the area
and to confine mining within the
surface lines ertically extended
The arguments in faor of a change
in the mining laws along the lines
aboe indicated are* forcible and
many The complex system now in
force is anything but satisfactory
It has gien birth to much exatious
litigation, and has resulted in con
flicting decisions With the right
to mine within certain well defined
limits, matters would be greatly
simplified A claim 1500 feet wide,
instead of 600 feet under the present
law, would still fall a long way short
of meeting all the requirements of a
mine along the mother lode With
the lode line in the center of the
claim, this would gie 750 feet as the
utmost distance the ein could be
followed on its eastern dip This
limit, with the ordinary pitch of the
ledge on this lode, would be reached
in a depth of from 1500 to 2000 feet
Howeer, any change in the law
would not affect existing patented
claims; probably would not effect
unpatented locations And as all
the territory embracing the main
mineral belt of this county is claim
ed, the proposed change in the law
would make ery little difference in
this mineral section

Kennedy— As a result of the de
elopments on the 2200 and 2300 leels
last month, the stock of tho company
jumped seeral dollars per share
While a portion of the ledge Is said to
be ery rich, on the whole it is a low
grade proposition The ore body is
large, in places oer 100 feet wide, and
taken altogether it is not expected to
aerage more than from $5' to $6 per
ton This, howeer, Is just the kind of
a proposition that mining men prefer

Fell own Shaft-
Pete Senney, commonly known as
Fronch Pete, met with a serious acci
dent in the east shaft of the Kennedy
on Tuesday afternoon He is a car
penter, and went to work for the Ken
nedy Company only the day before the
accident He was employed -on the
surface principally Something, how
eer, needed fixing about the tank at
the 2500 leel, which required the ser
ices of a carpenter, and he was de
tailed to assist in making the repairs
It was his first experience in a mining
shaft He either missed his footing or
slipped, with the result that he fell
from the tank to the platform below, a
distance of 10 or 12 feet The opening
into the sump occupied the center of
the shaft, but he fortunately missed
falling into that His fellow workmen
got him out as soon as possible, and he
jas brought to town, to Chirm's lodg
ing house- r Endicott was called,
and found that a portion of the collar
bone was broken, with a number of
slighter injuries It is thought that
it will be six or eight weeks before he
will be able to go to work again

A New Surey,
Tha Standard Electric Company

Monday to surey a new power line

tho direction of Mr Gould, a thorough

which is fully eight miles in length,
will occupy from fie to six weeks At
least three routes will be sureyed,
and from these the final selection will
be made by the directors We under
stand the line is to be as straight and
short as possible The object of erect
ing the new line we are unable to ex
plain The old line has been con
demned for some reason, probably
owing to the fact that it carries so
many wires, and hence more liable to
accident The telephone wires are
strung along the same poles, and this
practice is found ery unsatisfactory
It is probable that the new power line
is intended to remedy the eils of such

THE EMSLIE ROA-JCASE
Farette Hace loses' on All Points Submitted
to the Jury— A Costly Piece of
Litigation
The suit brought by Amador county
against Fayette Mace, to condemu cer
tain portions of land owned by F Mace
in Pioneer school district, which were
needed for a priate road by Eric W
Emslie, camo to a termination last
Friday The trial occupied the court
from Monday mornirg until Friday
eening Tho matter has been before
the superisors and courts for oer
fie years The road iewers appoint
ed by the superisors to suroy and re
port upon the question of damages, al
lowed i their report $150 to Mace as
compensation for the damage that
would accrue by reason of the proposed
road Maco refused to accept this
award Hence the matter was taken
into court by the county, to hae the
amount of damages assessed by a jury
There was such a diergence between
the amount offered by the county and
the sum which the nonconsentlng land
owner deemed a fair compensation,
that there was no hope of a compromise
The trial lasted fie days, with twele
jurors at $2 per day and mileage, otlicial
reporter at $10 per day, and a host of
witnesses at the same per diem and
mileage as the jurors The costs will
therefore approximate $500 The
award of the jury is $40 less than the
sum offered Mace in the first  place
The costs will therefore be thrown upon
the defendant It is reputed that the
case will be taken to the supreme court
on appeal The special issues submitted
to the jury and the erdict of the jury
thereon were as followsPersonal
Ist On the 15th day of August,
1901, what was the alue of the prop

Monday afternoon that the business

gether with a barn, had been destroy
ed Lawrence Burke, the owner of the
slaughterhouse and butcher shop, was
in Jackson at the time, and receied
an urgent message from home to re
turn as soon as possible, as a fire was
raging From this the exaggerated
reports aboe alluded to were doubt
less set afloat
The truth seems to be that a grass
fire started not far from the slaughter
house, and was making headway in the
direction of the Burko building It
was extinguished, howeer, without
doing any damage worth speaking of
Soon afterward, a fire started in
town, in the residence of William
Felker It started from the kitchen,
and the roof was all ablaze beiQre the
alarm was gien The flames ' spread
from the dwelling house to the black
smith shop near by, and both, struc

blacksmith 6hop was run by William

THE EAST BELT
[ Communicated ]
Considerab'a actiity is being mani
fested on the east mining belt in Ama
dor county, and quite a number of
mines are^ doing deelopment work,
some of which are new discoeries,, and
others that were idle for a long time,
in need of ' money to continue | Al
though this section is thinly populated
local capital has played a most import
ant part in what improements are
already made The principal element
of success in  quartz mining is capital,
and enough of it, and the places on the
Pacific coast are extremely rare where
such ast bodies of ore containing
alues rich enough to pay handsome
diidends on a reasonable amount of cap
ital judiciously expended, exist as are
here First-class gilt edge prospects
are to be found here where the owners
hae not the knowledge or the means
to attract the attention of capital need
ed for the deelopment and machinery
to put the properties an s, paying basis,
which is mainly responsible for the
suspicion entertained by capitalists not
Informed on the mining industry
There Is quite a number of so-called
"wild cat propositions" that in justice
to original owners should be credited
to poor financiering and ' not to worth
less properties Capital (for want of
organized effort) has been allowed to
pass our door In a steady stream to
other portions of the east belt in Tuol
umne county, and in the last few years
numerous diidend paying mines hae
been deeloped, notably tlio Black
Oak, Soulsby, Confidence, Con Eure
ka, Grizily, Proidence New Era,
Longfellow, etc - - F-

saying, "It is unnecessary for me to

PERPETUAL MOTION
One Inentor Baa Accomplished It
by Harnessing a Cyclone
It was during the portion of his ca
reer when he lied In the alley of the
south fork of the Big Sunflower rier
that Henry Plymshaw, the Inentor,
made his most notable inention This
inention had to do with cyclones
One afternoon Inentor Plymshaw
saw a splendid specimen of a funnel
cyclone coming oer the prairie, and he
called to me and said he would go out
and study It, since It was eident that
it was going to one side The Instant
the cyclone sighted us it came straight
In our direction We weren't prepared
for this exactly, so all we could do was
to run We were Just on the point of
giing up when a most extraordinary
thing happened Ourioue thing Sort of
natural too And there it was Only
one leg, and that down a fifty foot well
In the middle of a sheep pasture If it
had had two legs, no doubt it could
hae Bilrambled out, but It couldn't
make it  with one Couldn't do any
thing except reole And it did do
that I neer saw a cyclone reole like
that one Mad apparently because it
had missed Plymshaw and me and got
caught So it Just buzzed around like a
top Nothing In the world to stop It
Most men— mere men of action
would, hae been satisfied at getting
away and not haing to reole with
the houses and lots, but not Plymshaw
No He got to thinking, and what was
the result? Put a belt around the stem
of that cyclone Just at the top of the
well, set up a dynamo, strung wire and
ran all the machinery and electric
lights In that part of the country Reg
ular Niagara for power Going yet
Nothing to stop it, you see Wonderful
what a thing mind is!— H V Marr in

A OMESTIC EXPERIENCE
The Reason One Woman's Cook Was
iMsntlafled With Her Place
"This Is a queer age we lie in,"
sighed a young housekeeper "We'e
Just lost a ery good cook for a ery
absurd reason, I think She came to
us about four months ago and was
satisfactory' in eery way— neat, in
dustrious, respectful and last, but
foremost, an excellent cook
"As she was so ery quiet 1 could
not tell whether or not she was as
well pleased with us as we were with
her, but about six weeks ago the trou
ble began She asked me suddenly
one day why we entertained so sel
dom
" 'Ella,' I said, 'we don't care to en
tertain except a- few choice friends
now and then It costs more than we
can afford, nnd we really don't care
for it'
" 'Your house is just as handsome as
anybody's,' she went on 'Other peo
ple that I'e lied with entertained all
the time, and their houses weren't
near as pretty or as nice as yours
You neer hae anything but a club
meeting once In awhile Why don't
you hae teas and receptions, Mrs
Blank?'
"I reiterated my two reasons— that
we couldn't speud money in that way
and that we preferred simple amuse
ments Ella didn't seem satisfied, but
the matter was dropped Last Mon
day she asked to spend a week at
home Trith her sick aunt, and, as I
couldn't well refuse, she departed To
day I receied a postal card from her
couched in these wordsPersonal
"ear Mrs Blank— My aunt Is better,
but I'm not comingPersonal back I'e got a more
stylish place"

Three Rules For Fishing*
One day as the Re Mark Guy
Pearse of London was strolling along a
rier bank he saw an old man fishing
for trout and pulling the fish out one
after the other briskly "You manage
it cleerly, old friend," he said "I
hae passed a good many below who
don't seem to be doing anything"
The old man lifted himself up and
stuck his rod in the ground "Well, you
see, sir, there be three rules for fish
ing, and 'tis no good trying it if you
don't mind them The first is, Keep
yourself out of sight; the second is,
Keep yourself further out of sight, and
the third is, Keep yourself further out
of sight still Then you'll do it"
idn't Know Her
"What has become of Miss Blank,
who was always such a faorite in
your set?"
"Her father failed some weeks ago,
and all they had was sold at auction"
"Poor thing!"
"And now they hae to lie in a lit
tle house In the suburbs"
"What a change! How she must feel
it!"
"Yes; She is so much changed that
een her best friends would not recog
nize her I met her in the street to
day and did not know her at all, poor
thing"
Matched Puislers
"Papa," said the inquisitie young
ster, ''why is it that people rescued
from drowning are always saed just
as they are going down for the third
time?"
"Why is it," returned the father,
"that a small boy always picks out
unanswerable questions to ask?"— Ch

CHELSEA'S NOTE BUNS
t-ll London Used io Visit Mrs Band*
on Good Friday
Howeer religious obserances may
change in England, the eating of hot
cross buns on Good Friday is not likely
to die out Still, enthusiasm in this
particular has considerably declined
since the days when Mrs Hands kept
the Chelsea Bun House at the corner
of Jews' row, now Plmllco road So
many people were in the habit of flock
ing there on Good Friday in order to
eat hot cross buna that on one occasion
50,000 persons assembled there, and
£250 was taken in the day for buns
alone After this the inhabitants of
Chelsea protested against the noise and
disturbance this caused, and Mrs
Hands, fearing to be restrained by the
law, issued in 1703 a quaint proclama
tion, stating how, "desirous, therefore,
of testifying her regard and obedience
to those laws by which she is happily
protected, she is determined, though
much to her loss, not to sell cross buns
on that day to any person whateer,
but Chelsea buns as usual"
This Mrs Hands was something of a
character in her own way The royal
family and many of the aristocracy
used to isit her in the morning, and
Queen Charlotte een presented her
with a siler half gallon mug contain
ing- 5 guineas The house remained In
the possession of her family for some
time, as Sir Richard Phillips, writing a
few years before its destruction, men
tions After admitting that for upward
of thirty years he had neer passed the
house without filling his pockets, he
goes on to say, "These buns hae af
forded a competency and een wealth
to four generations of the same family,
and it is singular that their delicate
flaor, lightness and richness hae ne
er been successfully Imitated" When
Ranelagh was closed, the Bun House
declined In popularity, though as late
as 1839 24,000 buns were sold on Good
Friday alone— London Chronicle
POWERFUL VOICES
Some Historic Shrlekers Who Ante-
dated the Famous Stentor
The question has often been asked,
"Who was the most loud oiced man
of history?" The answer usually is
that it was Stentor, of whom Homer
says his oice was as loud as that of
fifty other men combined and from
which we get the phrase "stentorian
oiced" But we hae record of two
historic "shrlekers" anterior to Homer
We read where Simeon and Lei fought
against the twele men of the city of
Sarton and that Lei beheaded one
man with his own sword In chapter
38, erse 41, of the book referred to the
story is related in the following wordsPersonal
"And the sons of Jacob seeing that
they could not preail oer the twele,
Simeon gae a loud and tremendous
shriek, and the eleen remaining men
were stunned by the awful shriek"
In chapter 39, same book, erse 19,
we find the following account of the
battles of the sons of Jacob with the
inhabitants of the city of Gaash It
seems as though the battle was both In
the front and in the rear and that the
warriors on the wall were throwing
spears and hurling stones upon the
Eons of Jacob What next occurred, as
related in chapter and erse aboe
cited, is recorded in these wordsPersonal
"And Judah; seeing that the men of
Gaash were getting too heay for
them, gae a piercing and tremendous
shriek, and all the men of Gaash 'were
terrified at Judah's cry, and men fell
from the wall at the sound of his pow
erful shriek, and all those that were
without as well as those within the
city were greatly afraid of their lies"
The Canary Is a Little Plgr
The canary ia always regarded as a
small eater, just as the pig is notorious
for its gluttony People with small ap
petites are often twitted for not eating
more than enough to feed a canary,
and this led a man who was a tiny eat
er to watch the yellow bird and report
He found that a canary that weighed
247 grains ate just thirty-two times its
own weight in a month; that Is, it ate
rather more than its own weight on an
aerage eery day Anyone who watch
es the little bird will notice that it Is al
ways eating Now, says the inestiga
tor, a pig doesn't eat its own weight e
ery day, glutton as it is Hence be
thinks that the canary deseres to be
classed as a little pig— London An

AN INTERNATIONAL TOWN
Peculiarities of Rogales, on the Hex-
lean Border Line
It would be Incorrect to date a letter
from either Nogales, Ariz, or Nogales,
Mex, alone, for the town belongs so
thoroughly and completely to both
that neither half is a town at all It
is the most completely and curiously
international place that can be concei
ed of There is no separation of the
two parts isible as you look down on
the town from the hills, and the life
and the ordinary traffic of the place
flow back and forth with no one ap
parently to say them nay Howeer,
it must not be supposed that there la
free trade across the thoroughfare'
which on one side is called Internation
al street and on the other the Calle In
ternational
In the middle of the street, where
the Calle Ellas, or main business
street, crosses the International aye-;
nue, stands a stone obelisk about
twele feet high, and In the icinity;
of this are always one or two guards
In ciilian dress, who pay' no attention
to empty handed passersby, but will
stop any carriage or any person who'
offers to cross with a burden that
might contain dutiable material Oc
casionally on the Mexican side one
sees a Mexican soldier in uniform,'
but the cuartel near by Is too small tp
hold more than a small detachment;'
and neither soldiers nor uniformed cus
toms guards are eer in eidence along
the border
The Americans lie apart from one
another In Indiidual bouses of au
grades, most of which are ery neat
and some of which are quite fln and
must hae been costly Their streets
run up the Bides of the mountain glen
In which the town Is situated In
among their houses are the adobe cab-
Ins of the Mexicans, who are their
hewers of wood and drawers of tt&
ter (these terms being literally correct
here, for the fuel of the country Js
knotted and gnarled wood, brought
from the hills on donkeys' backs, and
the town water won't run up to the
higher eleations)
