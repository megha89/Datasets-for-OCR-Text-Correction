NOTHING EFINITE
The republican primary elecion las week was a surprise
o boh he conending facious ;I was hough ha wo
poins would be definiely seled by he elecors' Firs,
wheher he reform wing, known as he LincolnRooseel
League, or he old machine mehods which so seriously im
paired he pary srengh a he las general elecion, should
conrol he organizaion for he coming wo years; and, sec
ondly, wheher he California delegaion o he naional con
enion would be commied o suppor Taf for presidenial
candidae The resu, howeer, has failed o clear up he
siuaion as regards eiher proposiion In he large ciies he
reformers seem o hae won; bu only abou onehird of he
oal membership was eleced by ciies where he primary
law is made compulsory, and in hese he machine represen
ed by he sae commiee secured a song minoriy The
oher delegaes were eiher eleced a semiofficial primaries,
or by he pernicious plan of appoinmen by he respecie
couny commiees I seems srange, afer he experience of
he pas ha he laer mehod was resored o in any case
I was so emphaically sa down upon by he oers ha i
was hough ha such usurpaion of auhoriy would no be
aemped again for many years Bu i was in no a few
insances, and his fac is ap o cause a sorm in he sae
conenion which assembled in Sacrameno yeserday These
appoined delegaes are expeced o sand in wih he old re
gime, and wih heir help he organizaion forces beliee hey
can dominae he conenion easily This, howeer, is no
conceded by he leaguers, who hope ha he moral effec of
heir successes a he regular primaries will sweep many an
oherwise doubful delegae o heir sandard
s for he presidenial preference issue, Taf failed o ge
he popular indorsemen The majoriy oing on his issue
waned Rooseel for a hird erm, wih Taf a srong second
choice So ha he poliical siuaion is no clearer from he
acion of he primaries Indeed, s more complicaed han
eer In spie of he ofrepeaed declaraion ha he would
no be a candidae under any circumsances, here is a srong
desire o force he nominaion upon Rooseel anyhow, and
pu he refusal squarely up o him If he senimen ex
pressed a he primaries is o goern, he California delega
ion is pledged o suppor Rooseel — who is no a candidae,
and will no ake he nominaion if endered I is cerainly
a peculiar lineup, suggesie of grae possibiliies in he
een of a proraced sruggle oer he nominaion a Chi
cago For he sake of pary harmony a moemen is being
sared looking o he wihdrawal of a number of prominen
candidaes, wih he objec of securing he nominaion of Taf
on he firs ballo This plan migh aoid a lo of bierness
in he conenion, as well as much soreness hroughou he
campaign
Naions like indiiduals are oerawed by a display of
srengh; i may neer be acually exered, bu he knowledge
ha s here, ready for an emergency, has he same whole
some effec as hough he laen power were in full operaion
The grea squadron of warships riding peacefully a anchor
in he bay of San Francisco is no iueuded o prooke a
quarrel; no a menace o Japan in paricular which has sud
denly jumped o he fron rank as a miliary and naal
power I simply means ha he Unied Saes is able o pro
ec her ineress hroughou her as possessions I is
hoped ha his naion will neer be called upon o urn
loose hese engines of desrucion agains eiher a foreigu or
domesic foe, sill he eerincreasing armamens of oher na
ions impel us o be in a sae of readiness I is regreable
ha his is so, inasmuch as he mainenance of army and
nay in his as in eery oher ciilized counry, is a serious
drain upon he physical energies of he naion, as well as a
grae problem from a financial sandpoin The day mus
surely come when he naions from sheer inabiliy o wih
sand he drain, mus call a hal in his policy, and adop re
renchmen In he presen spiri of inernaional rialry
armies and uaies on a big scale canno be dispensed wih,
and herefore eery parioic ciizen mus feel proud in he
consciousness ha i hese respecs merica is keeping

A Hard Knock.
Railroad claim agents have little
faith In their fellow creatures. One
safd recently: "Every time I settle a
claim with one of these bard headed
rural residents who wants the railroad
to pay twice what he would charge the
butcher if he gets a sheep killed, 1
think of this story, illustrative of the
way some people want to bold the rail
road responsible for every accident, of
whatever kind, that happens. Two
Irishmen were driving home from
town one night when tbeir buggy ran
Into a ditch, overturned, and they were
both stunned. When a rescuer came
along and revived them the first thing
one of them said was. 'Where's the
train?' 'Why, there's no train around.'
he was told. 'Then where's the rail
road?' 'The nearest railroad is three
miles away.' he learned. 'Well, well,'
he commented. 'I knew it bit us pret
ty hard, but I didn't suppose it knock
ed us three miles from tbe track!' "—

In order to lighten the solemnity, she
said, turning to the rabbi. "Do you
know, I feel as If I were a leaf be
tween tbe Old and the New Testa
ments."
The rabbi turned a sad eyed gaze
.upon her.
"Yes, madam." he said. "and. If you
will recall, that page is usually a blank
one." .
She Was a Bit Bashful.
