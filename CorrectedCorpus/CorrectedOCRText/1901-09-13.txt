JACKSON AMADOK COUNTY CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 13 1901
The Frotts of War
Not long ago I visited tho town of
Novara, in northern Italy There in a
wheatfield the farmers have plowed
up ekull* of men until they have piled
up a pyramid 10 r 12 feet high Over
this pyramid some ona has built a can
opy to keep off the rain These were
the skulls of young men of Savoy, Sar
dinia and Austria— men of 18 to 35
j-ears of age peasants from the farms
end workmen from the shops— who
met at Novnra to kill each other over
a matter in which they had very little
concern
Further en Frenchmen, Austrians
and Italians fell together at Magenta,
the hue of the blood that flowed out
under the olive trees Go over Italy
as you will there Is scarcely a ppot not
crimeoned by the blood of France,
»carcely a railway station without its
pile of French skulls You cau trace
them across to Egypt, to the foot of
tho pyramids You will find them in
Germany— at Jena and Leipgic, at Lut
zen ajid Bautzen and Austcrlitz You
will find them In Kussia at Moscow,
in Belgium nt Waterloo "A boy can
stop a bullet as well as a man," said
Napoleon And with the rest are the
skulls and bones of boys "ere evening
to be trodden like the grass"— Popular

Qoerr Turkish Fish
April 19 Is the great fete day of "Ba
lukll," or place of fishes This Is a
small church situated outside' the walls
of Constantinople, and it enjoyed uo
particular reputation before the con
quest of Constantinople by the Turks
At the time, of the Invasion, however, a
monk was cooking some fish there
when a messenger came and told him
that the Turks had entered Constanti
nople The monk did not believe the
story and said he would sooner believe
that the half cooked fit-h would jump
back into tbc water As he spoke the
fish jumped back into the water, and
since then the place has had a great
reputation for its healing powers ,'- '<
A church has been built over the
spring dedicated to "Our Lady of the
Fishes," and on this day a regular pil
grimage takes place from all parts of
the town Many sick are carried thith
er, and many miraculous cures are re
ported The trutb of tho story Is proved
by the presence In a large marble lined
tank in the church of the lineal de
scendants of the half cooked fish Any
ono who doos not believe has only to
look In the water, and he will sec them,
brown on one side and white on the
other, swimming about at their ease
Sea Bathing
A person can easily determine with
ono Indulgence whether or not open
air bathing is hurtful to him If cir
culation is speedily restored after he
has left the water, if bis skin is well
reddened and be Is soon well warmed
up and as strong and "lively" as when
be took his first plunge, then he may
properly assume that bis bath has done
Idm good If, on the other hand, his
skin continues cold and clammy for 15
or 20 minutes, notwithstanding thu
brisk rubbing bo gives himself, and for
an hour or more afterward he Is weak,
dull and languid, then he may be toler
ably certain that there Is something
wrong with him which forbids cold
bathing
A rot Walloper
The parliamentary register for 1806
showed that there was then only one
pot walloper In all England One see
ing the term for the first time might
easily imagine that a pot walloper was
a species of Ichthyosaurus or some oth
er reptile of a past age It will be dis
covered upon inquiry, however, that
the term "pot walloper" is literally one
who boils apot and was applied to vot
ers In certain boroughs of England
where, before the passage of the re
form bill of 1832, the qualifications for
suffrage was to have boiled (walloped)
bis own pot in the parish for six
months t v ;

The laundress* little boy is being
strenuously brought up "by hand"
'?Why, mum" she said despairingly, "If

confusedly at some pennies given him
by the mistress "What do you say to

Willie looked troubled Then, "Yes,

membering all his "manners" at once,
the occasion evidently being great

A WORTHY SUCCESSOR
"Bcnetfting New Under Tin San"
All Doctors have tried to cure
Catarrh by the use of powdors, acid
gases, inhalers aud drug* in paste form
Their powdars dry up the mucuous
momhranes causing them to crack open
and bleed The powerful acid* used in
the iuhalcrs have entirely eaten away
the same membranes that their makers
have aimed to cure, while pastes and
ointments cannot reach tee disease
An old and experienced practitioner
who has for many years mado a close
study aud specialty of the treatment of
Catarrh, has at last perfected a treat
ment which, when faithfully used, not
only relieves at once, but permanently
cures Catarrh, by removing the cause,
stopping the discharges, and curing' all
inflammation It is the only remedy

remedy is known ay "Snuffles the
Guaranteed Catarrh Cure, " and is sold

lar, each package containing internal

"Snuffles" 'is the only perfect
Catarrh, cure ever made and is now
recognized us the only safe and positive
cure fur that annoying and disgusting
disease It cures all inflammation
quickly and permanently and is also
wonderfully quick to relievo hay fever
or cold iv the head
Catarrh, when neglected, often leads
to consumption — "Snuffles" will save
you if you use it at once It is an ordi
nary remedy, but a complete treat
ment which is positively guaranteed to
euro Catarrh in any form or stage if
used according- to the directions which

The Prnjet Before Uettyiionrs'
General Daniel Sickles told a story
illustrating the tenderness of President
LlncotnV heart us well as bin faith In
Providence and bis Ixjautiful optimism
After Sickles had been wounded at
Gettysburg he was removed to Wash
ington, and the preddent called on him
at the hospital When the general
described the battle and the awful
slaughter, "Lincoln wept like a child"
"While the two armies were converjf-
Ing," said Lincoln, "I went into my
room and prayed as I never prayed be
fore I told God that If we were to
win the battle he must do it, for I bad
done all that I could I went from my
room with a great load lifted from my
shoulders, and from that moment I
never had a doubt as to the result We
shall hear good news from Grant, who
has been pounding away at Vicksbnrg
for so many months I am In a pro
phetic mood today, Sickles, nnd I say
that you will get well"
"The doctors do not say so"
"I don't care, Sickles, you will get
well," persisted the president
And that afternoon, General Sickles
goes on to cay, a telegram was receiv
ed from General Grant announcing the
fall of Vlckßburg His own recovery
soon followed

Virtue 0f the Mafia
Among the Mafia "onesta" is the
great virtue This virtue Is said to be
possessed by those who never under
any circumstances help the authorities
by giviug Information, not even of
crimes of which they may be the vic
tims To give Information Is to forfeit
all honor, to become a "cascittuni," or
spy
This feeling which underlies the Ma
fia, which Is not old, but was born in
Sicily at the beginning of the nine
teenth century,* Is due to the Inborn
hatred which the Sicilian lias for gov
ernment Any Interference of the au
thorities in his private affairs he re
gards with jealousy and dlßtrust In
his sight a man ,who calls on the au
thorities for anything Is vile  He be
lieves In Buttling private differences
privately, cither by fair fight or mur
der
No matter what n member of the
Mafia may suffer, he will never Inform
If he recovers from an injury, he will
avenge himself if he can, and If he
cannot he blames no one and would
scorn to even take the authorities into
his confidence A Sicilian proverb
runs, "If I live, I will kill you; If I die,
I forgive you"
Geographical Distribution of HaJr

Between this parallel and latitude 45

Switzerland and part of Piedmont and
passing through Bohemia and Austria

Rnllflghters Afraid of Coi»
It will probably not surprise our
readers to hear that most Spanish bull
fighters object to fighting cows The
real reason may, however, j astonish
them A sportsmanlike objection to
persecuting a female animal has noth
ing whatever to do with it' The fact is
that the average toreador Is sincerely
afraid of a cow - _;' -A
 And he has good reason The cows of
the half wild breed used for the arena
are much quicker In their movements
than are the bulls Their horns are
more pointed and more formidable
They do not lower their bends to the
ground, shut their eyea nnd charge like
a locomotive upon the rails, but are
aWt aud ready to follow every move
ment of their persecutors Their war
like tactics have been adapted not to
blind, bovine frontal attacks, l>ut to tlie
strategy of active and cunning beasts
of prey, of which the human bullfighter
Is only a feeble inlmlc If these cheap
Idols of the Spanish populace would
face young and active wild cows which
had just been robbed of their calves,
they might perhaps forestall tbe butch
er, but  they would, at any i rate, do
something to earn their laurels—Pear

Aa Editor and a Golden Hslr
"One beautiful spring morning an
editor found a golden hair lying bt>
tiwen the pages of a manuscript,"
writes Edward Bok In The Ladles'
Home Journal "The moment he reach
ed the page It gracefully Buttered out
Flushed with excitement, the editor
caught It It was not bis hair, he ar
gued, therefore It was not his property
Then, again, he thought, the owner
probably lost it and might need it So
lie put It back He was a methodical
man, nnd be replaced It exactly as he
had fouud It He was not many days
older when he received a letter proving
by the very hair he bad so dexterously
caught and conscientiously replaced
that he never bad read or even opened
the manuscript of the writer Could
anything have been a clearer case
against the editor? Moet certainly not
It was conclusive and final, don't you
see?"

Some time ago two hulking hob^-s
who had Just dismounted from a Cen
tral freight train asked a Yonker3 man
for a loan of 10 cents to secure gome
food He took them to a restaurant
and promised to provide them with
work as soon as they had finished eat

saidPersonal "Boys, roy cellar's full of water,
and I want you to pump it out I've
fixed theso hand pumps right hwe on
the sidewalk Never mlud the people
When they come along and ask ques
tions, just you say nothing, but pump
Ull the water's out of the cellar Keep

will pay you well"
Now, a tributary to the' Ncpporhan
river ran through this man's store cel
lar and out under the sidewalk, and the
pumps reached down into the rlv<*
The water pumped out by the hoboes
ran Into the sewer and back into the

Chocolate
In South America tho retail price for
the better grades of chocolate averages
about $1 a pound, while In Italy,
Trance, England and iv the United
States the better grades sell at n much
lower price In America the ordinary
chocolate of trade sells for about one
third of the price that is charged for it
where It is produced The cause of
this, the producers say, is that the
original product is adulterated greatly
before reaching Its final market, n
cheaper article than the cocoa beau
constituting the large proportion of 1)0
per cent of the chocolates of commerce
The cocoa bean from which chocolate
is manufactured Is produced In Its fin
est form In Venezuela, though various
other parts of Central and South Amer
ica grow and export large quantities
Two crops of the bean are gathered
each year, and the manufacture con
sists pimply In grinding up the beans
into a meal and then adding sugar and
arrowroot, with the necessary flavor,
usually vanilla or cinnamon The mans
Is moistened until it is In a semifluid
state, after which It is run Into molds

here they are at Dieppe within a stone's
throw of the casino, aod they may be
seen any day about the town selling
the shellfish from the rocks outside
their habitations They have certain
marked characteristics, one being a pe
culiar complexion of their own that
can be traced largely to a disinclina
tion on the part of the cave dweller to
avail himself of the water that washes
bo close to his door Their language
also Is peculiar, but whether It really
belongs to the stone age no one seems
to have discovered They have to bold

Guo'lnad's Old Common Field System
A "common field" is quite distinct
from n "common" It is a field be
longing to numerous owners  The land
consists of long narrow strips, perhaps
not more than ten yards wide and run
ning parallel with one another What
are the exact rules of cultivation that
obtaiu In Kent today we do not know,
but of old it was usual to have a regu
lar rotation, such as wheat one year,
barley or oats the second and fallow
the third When the crops were har
vested, each member of the community
getting his or her share, all could put
in their cattle, which roamed over the
whole field, feeding on the stubble, etc
And this was termed the "right of
sack" Tho ''common field" system was

THE SHOOTING OF THE PRESI
DENT
The shooting o f President Mc-
Kinlcy last Friday while in attend
 ance at the Buffalo exposition sent
a thrill of horror not only through
the United States, but throughout
the civilized world Three times
within the memory of the present
generation a president of these
United States has fallen by the
hand of an assassin Lincoln was
shot during a time of political ex
citement, at the close of the greatest
civil strife in history He was
sacrificed to the malevolence and
hatred engendered by that long
struggle to avenge the stiug of de
Personalfeat Garfield fell at the outset of
"his presidential career at the hands
"of a luuatic and disappointed office
seeker Giteau in his insane act
represented no class or organization
He stood alone, and was moved to
murder solely by the workings of
j his own depraved mind With the
attempt upon the life of McKinley
it is different \ He was in the noon
tide of his presidential career; the
zenith of his popularity He was
the honored guest at a national
festival, and extending the glad hand
of friendship to all, when the red
hand of anarchy reached out under
the guise of friendship, and cowardly
shot him down The would-be
assassin harbored no feeling of per
sonal enmity toward him, beyond the
fact that the majesty of law, the
power of the government, was per
sonified in him Because he was
the chief magistrate of the greatest
and freest nation on earth, he was
 marked for slaughter, by one whose
feeble mind had been wrought-up to
the murder point by the teachings
of the apostles of anarchy • These
anarchists are at war with all con
stituted authority They acknow
ledged allegiance to ho government
They train under the red flag — the
banner consecrated to disorder and
violence The preachers of this fire
brand organization may not sanction
assassination in express terms, but
they tell their dupes that society
should be disorganized, and govern
ment as now constituted should be
dissolved Rattle-brained fellows
of Czolgosz stripe n aturally in terpret
this as an incentive to kill those in
authority, and act accordingly
Thanks to prompt surgical attention
and a Strong constitution, the presi
dent will in all probability survive
this, murderous assault In that
hoped-for outcome, the law provides
no adequate punishment for  the
crime Although the crime in its
very nature stands alone and
separate from ordinary assaults to
'murder, the law unfortunately
makes no distinction The bullets
that sought the president were
aimed at the life of the nation The
shooting was the act of an individual
— even admitting that no conspiracy
existed — in open rebellion against
the authority of the United States
The would-be assassin admits this
much The United States is fast
becoming the asylum for the an
archists of the world They are
driven from European countries,
where their infamous doctrines are
stamped out by the strong arm of
the law, aud seek the free republic
of the west in which to sow, without
molestation, their treasonable
tenets It is time that special laws
were passed to meet this condition
of affairs Any attempt upon the
life of the president should be made
a capital crime; punishable with
death Anarchistic organizations
should be suppressed Human laws
cannot reach the secret workings of
the mind Individuals may nurse
the spirit of anarchy in spite of all
laws that may be passed, but the
outward and visible manifestations
of that spirit can and ought to be
suppressed, whether "the spirit crops
up in a socialistic gathering or in
the columns of the yellow journal
ROAD EXPENDITURES
Tt will be of interest to every tax
payer to know what amount of
money is being expended upon the
roads in this county The road
system is confessedly the weakest
point in our local governmentPersonal
Under the very best system it would
be a difficult problem to haudle
Under an admittedly inefficient sys
tem it is a veritable sink hole for
swallowing up the public money
We have compiled the following
table from the official records, show
ing the amount of money that has
been expended upon the roads in
the various road districts, during
the six years— ending January 1,
1901Personal
The table represents the total
revenue from all sources that has
been collected for road purposes and
actually expended upon the roads
It includes the money paid into the
treasury from road poll taxes, but
not the collector's commissions on
such poll taxes Weyenture to say
the figures will be a surprise to
many, although it has been well
kuown to every one who has deal
ings with the tax collector that large
sums were being dumped upon the
county roads annually, if adequate
results followed this yearly expendi
ture, citizens would not complain
Every one realizes the benefits
accruing from good roads But the
outcome of this liberal allowance for
roads meets the expectations of no
one Only a few years back a
clamor was made to get the people
to vote for $60,000 worth of long
term bonds, the money to be used
for macadamizing the main highways
of the county It was preached at
that time that this sum would fix
the principal roads in good shape so
that a very small amount would be
needed annually thereafter to keep
them in repair The voters did not
take kindly to the proposition, and
voted it down overwhelmingly A
study of the table herewith produced
will show that they made no mistake
in jumping upon that scheme with
both feet One hundred and twelve
thousand dollars expended on Ama
dor roads in the past six years, not
reckoning the expenditures for the
current year, which have been un
usually heavy Over $30,000 has
been spent on the lone road and
connecting links in the past three
and a half years Nearly the same
amount has been expended in six
years upon the roads in township
one, outside of the lone road To
make the showing still more re
markable scarcely any of this money
has been devoted to the streets of
Jackson The town residents have
the privilege of participating in the
payment of road taxes, and are ex
pected to pungle up for their own
streets beside In three years end
ing January Ist last, $66,51920 have
been used upon the roads in Amador
county— an average of more than
$22,000 per year What have we to
show for this vast outlay There is
a noticeable improvement for more
than half the distance of the lone
road; also the road between Jackson
and Amador City is macadamized
The question is, Ought we not to
have a much greater mileage of
roads permanently improved con
sidering the amount expended Is
there not something fatally defective
in the system which gives so little
for so much cost We are not
arguing for reduced road tax We
know that roads cannot be kept up
without money But we do contend
that the sums we are now spending —
and have been spending for years —
ought to be productive of more
tangible results We do not blame
the supervisors who are road com
missioners in their respective dis
tricts They are probably doing
the best they can under the circum
stances The weakness is inherent
in the road system, not so much in
the meu who are at the head of the
system, and who are charged with
the expenditure of the funds It
seems suicidal to cling to a system
year after year which experience
has proved to be a ruinous one A
return to the old plan of small road
districts and a road-master elected
in each district, would be infinitely
preferable to the one now in vogue
We hope the people generally will
agitate this subject, and demand
such radical changes as are necessary
to secure a dollar's worth of labor
intelligently applied upon the road
for eyery dollar expended

THE GOOD OLD WAY
Democracy never was much
troubled on tlie question of civil
service reform Personal The only reform
worth inaugurating in the estima
tion of the, members of that party,
consists in turning republicans out,
aud putting democrats in ' their
places-whenever aud wherever they
get an opportunity At  tlie last
election Mariu couuty went demo
cratic The board of supervisors is
democratic by two to three, for the
first time in twenty years Ama
dor county went republican in the
same ratio for the first time iv ten
years — barring count-outs But
democracy, for the good of the
party, believes in a strict applica
tion of the doctrine of "To the vic
tors, belong the spoils" They
would have applied this~ in Marin
couuty months ago had they been
able to settle on the faithful few who
were to be honored with the emolu
ments of office A press dispatch
from San Rafael says that at the
meeting of the board this month by
a strict party, vote, Mrs A J
Saunders was removed from her
position as superintendent and
matron of the county poor farm and
William Jones, a democi'at, elected
to the position of superintendent,
while his wife was given the office of
matron At the same time V Guide,
a stanch republican, who for years
has been gardener and janitor at the
court house, was taken off the pay
roll, and his place filled by H A
Ames, another good rustler after
democratic votes The slaughter
was then discontinued, but it is
understood that the stoppage is only
temporary and that other heads are
doomed to the basket Civil service
is not bothering the democratic
majority and the faitful are clamor
ing for their reward
Republicans are not blaming them
for thus acting They expected just
sui-h an outcome of democratic suc
cess at the ballot box The much
vaunted civil service reform was
never iutended to apply to such of
lices It is absolutely essential that
subordinate places be given as the
reward of faithful party service
The officials who undertake to turn
down Ihis principle will be apt to
find out — perhaps when it is too
late— that they are simply turning
down themselves

The following article, taken from the
Atcbison Globe, should be road by
every man interested in strikes, and
should be read by that yellow journal,
the Examiner, which is doing all it can
to injure, not only San Francisco, but
the entire state of California The
article should be read also, by the
miners and others at Jackson, who
have been trying to organize unions
here
''The town of McKeesport, Pa, was
made by the steel companies When
the strike of the steel workers was or
dered, Mayor Black, of McKeesport,
came out in an interview siding with
the strikers He did not attempt to be
fair; he simply wanted to stand well
with the men who had votes He was
in favor of anything; rioting, burning,
shooting; anything to stand well with
the strikers The owners of the steel
mills thought that this was rank in
justice, and began tearing down
their mills, with a view of removing
them The mayor then found he had
made a mistake The people of Mc-
Keesport blamed him, and he is now
trying to square himself Instead of
counseling moderation, justico, arbi
tration, fairness, and common sense,
he became a ranting fool, and talked
nonsense that even the sensible strik
ers thought disgusting A glance at
the social and economic conditions of
McKeesport shows that the city was
in the most prosperous condition of
any placo of its size in Pennsylvania
The daily paj roll of the sheet steel
mill that is being moved away is at
least $6,000, or $1,890,000 a year The
daily pay roll of the National Tube
mill, that may be moved away, is $27,
000, or $8,505,000 a year This sum of
$10,395,000 is what keeps the city go
ing The mill bands live well and ed
ucate their children well There is
none of the dirty, squalid poverty that
is to be observed in large cities The
citizens live in good houses Many of
the steel workers have built their own
houses Their tables are of the best
There are gorgeous barns, and rows of
well stocked stores, filled with the lat
est and most expensive- fabrics The
city supports three banks aud a very
prosperous trust company Three
newspapers are all making money All
eyes are on Mayor Black, because it
was his tongue that has brought the
city to the brink of threatened ruin
There is a panic in McKeesport Prop
erty values are tumbling, and Black is
held responsible"

A young man named Leo Cordes,
living between Angels Camp and Carson
Hill, was accidentally shot with a 22
calibor rifle last Sunday, while on a
visit to the Airola residence, which is
about a mile and a half from his home
It appears that Cordes, in company
with Mrs Airola and a young"- lady,
were spending tho afternoon near the
house, shooting at a target A shot
had been made, and Cordes was on his
way to examine the target The rifle
was in the bands of Mrs Airola, and
when Cordes was about fifty feet away
the weapon was discharged, the bullet
taking effect in Cordes' back near the
first dorsal vertebra, and close to the
spinal column Dr Dorroh, the family
physician, promptly advised the re
moval of tho young man to the German
Hospital in San Francisco, on tho bare
chance that an operation might save
his life He was taken below, agreeable
to advice, but when he reached the
hospital he was in anunconscious con
dition, and died shortly after his
arrival The deceased was a son of G
W Cordos, an old resident of Angels
Camp  The unfortunate lady to whom
the accident was due, was nearly be
side herself with grief, and, as a sequel
to the sad alTair, tried to commit sui
cide Tuesday night upon learning of
the death She seized a gun with that
intention, but the weapon was taken
from her She then asked for some

or other tools through in the same
way All this is wrong, and those
guilty of holding conversations with
prisoners without permission from the
sheriff, are guilty of a misdemeanor,
and are liable to arrest and punish
ment People have no business to
embarass the officers by an infringe
ment of the rules provided for the
government of the jail, and those
caught in the act will, in the future,
most likely, be punished
Schools Running
Nearly all the schools of the county
are now running The law requires,
when the teachers have been selected
by the trustees of the respective dis
tricts, that the clerk shall at once
officially notify the school superin
tendent of the fact, giving the names
of the teachers appointed In a num
ber of instances this duty has been
neglected, and it is likely to give
trouble unless attended to promptly
The superintendent has no authority
to draw his warrant for teachers'
salaries until he has this formal notifi
cation from the trustees How is the
superintendent to know who are en
titled to be placed on the pay roll of
the school fund unless this law is com
piled with?

The lone Academy
At last the long fight for some insti
tution of higher learning which has
been waged by tho friends of education
for the past ten years in various part a
of the county has been woo, and on
Monday, September 23 lone Academy
will open its doors as the first institu
tion of high school rank in Amador
county Tho event will be of im
portance not only to tho citizens of
lone, but to every resident of the coun
ty as well It is to be regretted only
that lone Academy must begin its ex
istonce as a private rather than a public
enterprise, and dependent upon the
generosity of a few public spirited men,
rather than on the public bounty
The history of the attempts made by
the people of lone to organize a Union
High School is too well known to re
quire repetition; the Academy idea was
born of the despair and disgust which
the failure of those attempts engender
ed The lone Academy Association
was organized, and thirty-two shares
of stock at $20 per share were sold
With this sum as a nucleus it was pro
posed to immediately establish an
Academy An uuusod church building
was remodeled to serve as a class loom,
and Mr Alexander Gordeuker, a
graduate of the State University, was
engaged to preside over tho future
The course of study which will be
pursued during the first year i 3 do
signed to give the student a good edu
cational foundation Few pupils grad
uate from the grammar schools with
any considerable training in the uso of
the English tongue, and with the
standard works of literature The
Academy will provide for a thorough
training in oral and written exprosbion,
with special reference to correct gram
mar and spelling Also several stand
ard prose and poetical works will be
read In the department of history,
the ancient peoples will be studied as a
foundation for the study of modern
history The work in algebra and
geometry will be prefaced by a thor
ough review in arithmetic There will
also be offered courses in Latin, book
keeping and business forms, tbe latter
being for those who intend to take only
one year of work
If the Acadomy receives from the
people of this* county the proper sup
port, there can be no doubt of its suc
cess and growth The directors hope
to increase the teaching force, and to
erect a permanent building by next
year Every effort will be mado by
the principal and officers of the
Academy to find good accommodations
at reasonable rates for outside students,
and at tbe request of parents, a general
supervision over the deportment of
these will be kept out of school hours
Mining Notes
Kennedy — The oast shaft has been
sunk to a depth of 2400 feet perpendicu
lar depth At the 2100 level connection
has been made with tho workings of
the west shaft The east shaft will bo
continued down, and - the intention is
to make connections with tho old
workings at the 2400 and 2500 levels
It is the company's plan to erect a new
80 stamp mill near the east shaft next
summer There is no thought of
abandoning the present 40 stamp mill
It is believed that both can be kept
going, for an indefinite period The
ore body is 100 feet wide in places, of
low grade, but carrying sufficient of
the precious metal to pay, and leave a
small margin of profit The Kennedy
is by all odds the biggest mine ever de
veloped in Amador county, not alone
in its production of gold, but in the
number of men it will employ when
under full headway Personal -Personal '
Argonaut— The shaft has reached a
depth of 1850 feet Work has been
somewhat interfered with on account
of building a new elevated track across
the main road to provide dumping
facilities This will be completed in a
few days, and sinking will be pushed
ahead with all possible speed
Preparing for Winter — All the mines
using oil for fuel have made ample pro
vision for the storage of oil to tide them
over the wiuter season The contract
with D McCall, who has undertaken
to deliver the oil to the mines, requires
each mine to erect storage tanks cap
able of holding sufficient fuel to last 100
days In accordance with this agree
ment the Oneida has put up a tank to
hold 2400 barrels, the Kennedy 1500,
and the South Eureka and Lincoln
1200 barrels each The mine owners
continue to be well satisfied with oil as
fuel It has passed tho experimental
stage

enjoyed the day to a far greater extent
As it was, the cloud of du»t was so
great that one could not distinguish
his best friend a few feet away This
failure to sprinkle the road leading to
the grove from the gate, was the only

been done, and should bo remembered

A SINGULAR ACCIDENT
A Huge Boulder Falls into the Ken-
nedy Shaft
The north shaft of the Kennedy mine
was the scene of a singular occurrence
last Monday night It was about 11
o'clock, when the engineer discovered
that there was somß obstruction in the
shaft, which prevented the skip from
descending Anything suggestive of a
blockade of the shaft is always a seri
ous matter in connection with a mine
The matter was promptly reported to
the proper authorities, and steps were
immediately taken to ascertain the
nature of the trouble Descending the
shaft it was found that at the 1950 foot
level an immense boulder had slid into
the shaft, completely closing it, and
effectually cutting off ingress or egress
below The mass of rock was one solid
boulder, 30 feet long, and the entire
width of the shaft— about 13 feet The
shaft Is an incline, with a strong pitch
to the east It is supposed that tho
weakness at this point had its origin
many years ago, probably when the
shaft was sunk The timbers were
strong enough to prevent a collapse,
until these timbers became sufficiently
sapped by long use and exposure, to be
unable longer to bear the strain The
shaft is carefully examined at short
intervals, and every precaution is taken
to avoid such mishaps Not the
slightest indication was observed of the
impending disaster
All the men were at work in the
lower levels at the time— below the
point of obstruction They were not
in the least danger, as the south shaft
was available No one was hurt It
will take till the end of the week before
the mass of rock can be removed It
has to be blasted out where it lies in
the shaft, all precautions being taken
to hold it where it is until it can be
gradually removed For any consider
able portion of it to fall down the shaft
would work immense damage to the
timbers Mr Parks expects to have
everything in running order again in a
few days
PINE GROVE
Pine Grove, Sept 12— News is not
very plentiful around here Most of
the boys are working away from here,
and when they are not here it is very
quiet
Admission day was hardly noticed
here Some of our townspeople went
to the celebration at Fullen's Grove
The family of Mr Ballentine of De
fender, have moved in the Dennison
house, a short distance from town
We were treated to a small show in
the town hall last Tuesday night The
performance was pretty fair
 Mountain quail are beginning to
make their appearance a few miles
above here  This means an early
winter, so the old inhabitants say

The Captain of an Ocean Liner
Nowadays tiie captain is the host of
the shin He is no longer the gruff,
rcngh seadog in a pea jacket cf years
fscaby He must observe somoof the
social amenities; he must talk to the
passengers now and then when the
wertfcer is fine; he mnst take his soat
at tittle when he may; he must be a^
kind of diplomat also and possess wit
end tact and a patience sublime; ho s
urjst see that no jealousies develop!
among the passengers I have, been
t'fitl of the very obliging captain^who,
to please the lady who asked to be
srhewn tbe equator while the ship~was';
in hot; t hern seas, pasted a hair acrossj
tin* large end of a spyglass and told 'the'
lady to look And the lady through the
pla33 dec-lared she could see the equa
tor "as plainly as A B C" One other
polite captain I have heard of — one who
directed an officer on the bridge to "do'
as the lady wishes," when the lady re- t
quested that the captain steer the ship,
over to the horizon so she could see
what th? horizon was like— Captain"

But as I looked at them I saw they
did not run because they could not
The life was beaten out of them The
keepers brought the heavy- red cord
with a lnass hook at the end and

Professor Vivian Lewes, at the Lon

following answer to the question,
"Why do we bathe?" Twenty-eight
miles of sweat glands in our skin are
discharging 26 ounces of water per day
and leaving upon the outer surface of
the skin a full ounce of solid matter
These are aided by the oil glands of the

An art journal suggests raw potatoes
to clean oil paintings Have a few po
tatoes at hand, each cut in halves The
Tresh surface is dampened slightly with
cold water and used to rub the canvas
As the potatoes show soil the surface
Is sliced off and the rubbing continued
This process will create a little lather,
which should be wiped off as fast as It
accumulates with a clean, damp sponge
When the whole canvas Is cleaned, it
should be washed over lightly with
clean water from which the chill has
been taken and finally m the water
carefully wiped off with an old clean

While lecturing his congregation
rather strongly on a recent Sunday
about slack attendance and small col
lections a minister of a church In an
English city used the followiug elo
quent and forcible sentencePersonal "Yes,
brethren, our collection of a little over
£i{ last Sunday included no fewer than
500 halfpennies We all know about
the widow's mite, and I am sure we are
very glad to receive It; but I don't
think there are 500 widows In this con
gregation!"
"Witness My Hand
In the early days only a few schol
ars, priests and clerks knew how to
write It was then customary to sign
a document by smearing the hand with
ink and Impressing it upon the paper,
accompanied by the words, "Witness
my hand" Afterward the seal was in
troduced as a substitute for the hand
mark and was used with the words
above quoted, the two forming the sig
nature This Is the origin of tho ex

Proved Her Rationality,
Recently a bent old lady entered on©
of the Salina street stores and upon be
ing asked what she wished to see made
reply in what the dork judged to be an
unknown language A second inquiry
proving no more satisfactory, the clerk
excused herself and went In search of
one of her colleagues who Is of German
descent
"Oh, Miss L," she entreated, "won't •
you ccnie over to my counter for a min
ute? There's a poor old German lady
there, and I can't understand a word
she says"
Miss L followed and, pausing before
the stool on which the would be cus
tomer was seated, inquired in her
sweetest tonesPersonal
"Are you a German?'
The "poor old German lady" raised
her handkerchief to her lips and evi
dently extricated something from her
mouth Then, bending a look of the
utmost scorn upon the clerk, she ex
claimed in a rich and unmistakable
broguePersonal
"Carman, is it? Indade an I'm not

Entertninlac Sqnlrrels
Alive in his native woods the squirrel
is an amusing little fellow, and he will
entertain you by the hour if you* will
let him Personal'
You probably become first aware of
his presence by his dropping things on
your head Then he plays hide and
seek with you as he zigzags up a tree
While he pauses for thought, or pos
sibly to wash his face, another squirrel
comes scudding along the branches of
a neighboring tree, and away they go,
one chasing the other, jumping from
branch tip to branch tip, racing up and
down the trunk and making the bark
fiy Sometimes one loses his footing
and falls headlong 20 or 30 feet to the
ground, landing there with a force that
makes him bounce You think every
grain cf sense must be knocked out of
the small body, but he only blinks a
bit, and, after a moment spent perhaps
in letting the stars set that mnst have
suddenly risen before his eyes, he
streaks it up the nearest tree after the
other fellow Long after they have
disappeared from sight you hear them
chattering together up among the
leaves like two watchmen's rattles—
Philadelphia Record
Her Opinion of Asparagus
It seems that asparagus is not grown
In the tropics— at least It was not grown
at Rio de Janeiro when a certain Amer
ican gentleman, who had lived several
years in the Brazilian capital, went
with his wife and 8-year-old daughter
to visit friends living near Bueuoa
Ayres, a part of the continent where
tho climate is better adapted to the
fruits and vegetables of the temperate
regions
At the first dinner after their arrival
the visitors were treated to some fresh
asparagus The little 8-year-old daugh
ter was likewise served with the as
paragus, but she evidently did not
think much of it as an article of food
Her mother tried for some time to
coax her to eat it Finally the little
girl, taken between the rudeness of
whispering at the table and the rude
ness of not eating her food, leaned over '
and, with a choking voice and quiver
ing lip, whispered to her motherPersonal "21am
ma, it is not nice It's raw at one end
and votten at the other"
An English Explanation
This is the way a prominent English
paper explains itPersonal
The president of the United States,
who receives a salary of £10,000 a
year, must pay for all the food consum
ed at the White House, and the ex
penses of getting up an elaborate state
dinner are not small Cigars and
wines the president buys, and they
must be of the best He has to main
tain his own equipage The govern
ment, however, allows him a valet; al
so a clerk, who opens all his letters
All other personal servants must be
engaged by the master and mistress of
the White House

A Combination Tree
A pine tree and a birch tree hare
grown so close together In Woolwich,
lie, that one trunk serves for both,
sending forth pine branches on one
side and birch on the other The union
seems a happy one ln spite of the fact
that the two trees are as widely sep
arated by the botanists as two well
can bo, and the gnarled branches of
tbe pine embrace the birch ln a most
affectionate maivier
They Were Discovered
When they went Into the hotel, he
was determined to do nothing to betray,
the fact that they were newly married
He took up the pen for his first regis
