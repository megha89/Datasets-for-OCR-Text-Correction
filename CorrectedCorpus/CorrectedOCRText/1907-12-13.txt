What is wanted at this time is an investigation into the bills
allowed, to see whether they conform to established rates or
not; to look into the peculiar manner of fixing up proposals
for bids for supplies which have prevailed .for many years;
of the failure to call for bids at all where the law provides
"that a contract for certain supplies must be made with the
lowest bidder; of the consequent allowance of claims in open
defiance of law; of the ringing in of salary claims month
after month and year after year, when the law provides that
the same should be per diem charges at so much for eight
hours work and properly itemized; the mode of procedure in
road word and the payment of claims therefor; the absence
of any local law providing for the keeping of a proper record
book relating to one of the most important branches of county
revenue, and how a wholesome provision on the subject came
to be wiped from the ordinance. We venture to say that
these and doubtless other topics might furnish a chapter of
much interest to those who have borne, and are still bearing
the financial burden of government on an apparently endless
scale of progression. Oh, no; the grand jury is -anything,
but a fifth-wheel-to-a-wagon affair.

District attorney Langdon, and his voluble assistant Fran
cis J. Heney would appear to much better advantage in their
efforts to purify San Francisco if they would attend strictly
to their official duties, instead of lecturing all over the coun
try trying to prejudice the public mind against the graft de
fendants. A blabbing district attorney, denouncing a de
fendant from the rostrum, is hardly in accord with the Amer
ican idea of fair play. Civic righteousness is greatly to be
desired, official righteousness is equally desirable. A public
prosecutor endeavoring to create a prejudice outside against
one awaiting trial, advertises himself in the role of a perse
cutor.
The republican national committee has selected June 16th
as the time for) holding the national convention, and Chicago
as the place. That Chicago ]won easily against Kansas City is
interpreted by some,as a set-back to the administration forces,
but it is improbable if any issue was joined on that score.
President Roosevelt has again announced that under no cir
cumstances will he be [a candidate.

Train Went" Back
Eight Miles.
An incident occurred on the Ama
dor branch /ailroad between Gait and
lone last week, that has been various
ly interpreted, . and Which it is not
out •■• of place to . explain. >. xhe -up
train on Wednesday started ou its
trip to lone, and on reaching Conley,
the ilrst station from Halt, and fully
seven miles out, was, halted and on
receipt of a dispatch . went all the
■way back to Gait for . half a dozen
passengers that had beeu left at the
terminus there. Three passengers
happened (to be Japanese, who were
bound tor lone. /The idea got abroad
somehow that the fourteen or fifteen
mile extra trip was made in defer
ence to these Japs, and that it was
another case of America bowing - be
fore the little hrgwn .men ot the
Orient, but it was nothing, of the
sort.' 'l'he return trip was not made
in consideration of them particularly.
I'he truth is, 'the train pulled out of
Gait without stopping at the passenger
waiting room; 'as is . required to be
done. -The ., six passengers were left
behind in that way. One .of : the
passengers was a brother ot one of
the victims' of the Fremont mine
disaster, ■ who had come' all the way
from Utah and wanted .'■ to , reach the
scene of the accident ;as i soon 'as
possibe. Another passenger was a
lady/ who, was "on her ■• wayto~ ( Oleta
to attend the funeral ot ' her mother.
Now when.. they ; found v themselves
left at Halt, without as they claimed
any fault of their,' own," they . said
they would report the matter to the
tieaquarters -of the railroad, unless
the matter was -set right. :„ To
straighten/ the atfair out, the con
ductor, on reach iug Cotiley, ; conclud
ed to travel f buck ' to the ,'etaiting
point, and pick up the six passengers
who had come on the west' bound
train from 1 Sacramento, 'and were
waiting for : the lone train to take
them aboard.". That is all there is to
it. It is not another- example of
falling before the Oriental race.

Mrs. Boyson Dies
From Meningitis:
Mrs Boyson, wife of .". Dr. , Thomas
Boyson of Plymouth, died early "yes-|
terday morning at their home in that
place .; after an illness '. covering '* a
period ,of about seven weeks'. *;*; * The
immediate cause of l " her Jdeath was
cerebel meningitis, or iuflamation of
the membranes of ■ the brain. ;! She
was taken with this disease . about
two weeks ago. and was expected to
pass away at almost any minute, but
the iuflamation went down slightly so
that she was somewhat improved, but
the - strain had been altogether too
great. She had taken 110 nourish
ment to speak of during the entire
time.
A great many hearsay, reports have
been current iv Plymouth as to the
cause bt hex. illness. ' It seems that
they had a quarrel about .the '^ tenth
of October and the next 'day she ;ap'^
peared "on; the; streets ; with ;a',tery
swollen and discolored eye. v " ./.She .is
reported as laying to;a neighbor, thajt
he had struck her. Besides' this there
are many other rumors afloat.;
Dr.- Boyson being an eye specialist
treated his wife until; she became so
ill,' when he called in. Dr. / Norman*,
a practicing physician of Plymouth.'
When 'sheriff Gregory and district
attorney Vicihi ; spoke to? him [at the
charge that had been *oade':by^ some
of the people of that", town,^botb
doctors insisted that they^oall inT the^
county physician, which 4 was ; done."
This was a we^ek' ago Monday." .But
doctor Endicott could -'plainly; see.
that it was cerebal meningitis, but it
was not for him to say what the cause
of it might he,- for this oomes from
various reasons. Yesterday afternoon
an inquest was held;; but it was not
thought necessary to bold an autopsy.
Testimony was Haken ; in , the after-,
noon, and an evening cession was
held, while they came together, again
this morning, the jury fringing
verdict about noon L of . death .; from
causes unknown. Seven or eight
witnesses were called.
