A Queer Legend of Tailed Hen
When a natie ' Hollander wants to
dhow his hatred for an Englishman
he simply refers to him as a "steert
man"— in other words, "the man with
a tail" The legend says that Thomas
a Becket cursed the Kentish men who
spitefully cut off the tall of his horse
while he was riding the animal
through the country, and that the en
tire generation of Kent which followed
wore tails like those of horses John
Bale, Edward Vl's bishop of Ossory,
mentions the legend, but gies some
Variations 'as "to the cause of the ig
noble punishment He says John Cap
grae and Alexander of Esseby say
eth that "for castynge fyshe tayles at
St Augustine orsetshyre men had
tayles eer after that"
But Polydorus applies it to Kentish
men at Stroud, by Rochester, "for cut
tinge off Thomas Becket's horse's
tayle" One account says that only
those liing in Kent at the time of
the curse were "afflicted with large,
drooping tayles, like brutes; their pos
terity being not so affected"
ecline of the Essay
Why do we no longer flnd in these
magazines the long essays that were
the backbone of the old style period
icals? Is it because there are nowa
days no men who like to and are able
to take their pens in hand and ramble
on and on aimlessly oer hill and dale,
with many a leisurely pause and occa
sional airy flights? Is it because the
editors can flnd no writers who are
surcharged with iews on all sorts of
abstract subjects and could be moed
to impart those iews at length to the
readers of magazines? Certainly not
Almost eery man who writes at all
would like to write essays— long es
says But the wise editors won't hae
them any more, because the people
won't read them and won't een take
magazines that get the reputation • of
harboring them If 'an editor craes,
a small circulation in this day let him
gather the essayists about him and
freely turn them loose upon his pages

About Mngrnets
Magnets are frequently made In the
form of a horseshoe or letter U, but a
horseshoe magnet is really nothing
more than a bar magnet bent, As both
poles will attract iron it is apparently
twice as strong as when in the bar
form A piece of iron laid across the
poles is attracted by both of them In
this case the poles act on opposite ends
of the iron and do not destroy each
ether'g effects, for each pole magnetizes
the portion of the }ron opposite it The
iron therefore becomes ' a strpng mag?
net with its north pole touching the
6puth pole of the horseshoe magnet and
Its south pole touching the north pole
This is popularly called a "keeper," be
cause it "keeps," or preseres, the
strength of the  magnet, which be
comes much weaker when the keeper
is left off^t Nicholas
The Mattress
Some one has been hunting up the
history of the mattress  Its beginning
was the collection of rags, husks or
rreris which were bound together and
thrown down anywhere to form a rest
Ing place for the hinds and serfs of the
rich It is suggested that their names
of shakedown and makeshift were de
ried originally from the Arabic
word "matrah" In the middle ages
featheF beds found faor with the
wealthy and the mattress was not ose4
by them Inentories of estates owned
by the American colonists show that
mattresses were then worth $200 each,
being made of hair In England mat
tresses of rabbits' fur were once used
and  egetable fibers of arious kinds
hae sered their turn
False Hair In Elizabeth's Time
Queen Elizabeth had eighty wigs in
her collection, and her i cousin, Mary,
queen of Scots, had ''as many as a hun
dred," and among the incongruous
presents made her while confined a
prisoner in gloomy Lochleen, preious
to her being beheaded, wigs were nu
merous Gentlemen who particularly
wished to please their lady friends pre
sented them with wigs of the latest
ebade of hair and newest style of
colffuiing Fancy a gentleman of to
day presenting his sweetheart the last
idea in back hair!
Bamboo opals are peculiar gems
which are sometimes found in the
Btem of the bamboo This gem Is ery
rare from the fact that not one In a
thousand bamboo stems contains It
These egetable growths are called
tobacur by the Filipinos Some ot
them are so slml!arthat Is, they ex
hibit so perfectly the characteristics of
the opal— that een experts frequently
fall to distinguish them from the real
gem  "sr ;

Sources of Color
An interesting enumeration has been"
published in a technical journal of the
sources of color From this it appears
that the cochineal insects furnish the
gorgeous carmine, crimson, scarlet car
mine and purple lakes; the cuttlefish
gies sepia— that is, the inky fluid
which the fish discharges in order to
render the water opaque when attack
ed; the Indian yellow comes from the
camel, iory chips produce the iory
black and boneb'nek, tbe exquisite
Prussian blue comes from fusing horse
hoofs and other refuse animal matter
tcith impure potassium carbonate, a
rious lakes are deried from roots,
barks and gums; blue black comes
from the charcoalo f the ine stock,
turkey red is made from the madaer
plantJH'hich grows in Hindustan; the
yellow sap of a Siamese tree produces
gamboge, raw sienna is tbe natural
earth from the neighborhood of Siena,
Italy; raw umber is an earth found
near Umbrla, India ink is made from
burned camphor, mastic is made frost'
the gum of the mastic tree, which
grows in the Grecian archipelago;
bister is the soot of wood ashes; ery
little real # ultramarine, obtained from
the precious lapis lazuli, is found in the

Cutting Off the \r? For Puntfihmeii*
Rameses 11 of Egypt cut off the
nose of any person conicted of treason
or arson Actisanes, another Egyptian
ruler, punished robbers in the same
way After each nose had been ampu
tated back een with tbe "bridge" the
culprit was sent to a colony of noseless
felons, the place of banishment being
known as Rhinoeonum, from the na
ture of the punishment its colonists
had undergone
"In England In 1671 Lord Coentry,
then "great keeper of the British seal,"
had his nose cut off by order of the
king because he had dared to ask some
Questiqns about an actress then play
ing at rury L,ane theater
A conscript who protested openly
that he had been enrolled in the army
of Frederick the Great in a fraud
ulent manner had his nose amputated
by order of that soereign, who spoke
of the punishment as an "indelible
mark on the front side of the face"
The Impossible
The uke of Wellington wanted a
certain piece of work done and In
structed an officer of the Royal engi
neers to do it' After examination the
officer informed the duke that it ws>s
impossible
The duke sent for another officer, a
much younger man and attached to an
other diision of the army This ofii
cer did what the duke required'
The next morning there appeared in
the "orders of the day" the following
epigrammatic notePersonal "He who in war
fails to do what he undertakes may al
ways plead accident, which inariably

Host Expensie Tree In the World
Probably the most expensie tree in
the world is in the City of London, on
the corner of Cheapslde and Wood
street, about midway between the
Bank of England and St Paul's It
is an enormous oak, and is said to be
100 years old It is protected by a
clause in the deed of the property
which forbids destruction of tree or
branches Architects were compelled
to plan a rather peculiar building to
aoid the branches There it stands
in the corner of one of the busiest
streets in London, occupying ground of
enormous alue — and positiely the
only tree in the City of London out

Wrong Foot Out of Bed
About half the world puts the wrong
foot out of bed in the morning But
which is the wrong foot? It is a su
perstition as old as the hills that if the
left foot touches tbe floor first you will
hae bad luck that day Probably mul
titudes of men aoid this by sleeping
en the right side of the bed, so that in
rising the right foot naturally comes
first In contact with the floor It is
said to be a fact that most people lie ou
their right side because of the prea
lent notion that the heart has freer ac
tion—New York Press
When Romans Kissed
Bowena, the beautiful daughter of
the Saxon Henglst, is credited with
haing introduced kissing into the
British islands The Romans had a
really delightful word for a kiss—oscu
lum, /which came from os, the mouth,
and meant a little mouth, a sweet
mouth "Gie me a sweet little mouth"
would be the phrase used when a good
little Roman boy asked his mother for
a kiss

Margaret Kelton folded the Times

paper and studied the paragraph more
closely, with a ague hope that she
had made some mistake But hardly
She readPersonal ' *
"Mr Richard Kent Kelton, formerly
popular in this city in business and so
cial circles, now a resident of Phila
lielpiiia, is spending the cold months in
Florida for the benefit of his wife's
wifalth"  i      Personal ;
The problem of her life confronted
her, or, rather, the scruple Bhe had
neer been greatly In loe "with the
man, nor yet especially antipathetic
toward him Hence it was no easy
thing to do what she was forced to
contemplate But there was the other
woman Palpably the finger of duty
pointed but one way
Two days were required to put her
affairs into shape and to prepare for
the journey south
There was no difllculty about the
exact location She had often been
there in the past— with him, before the
separation fie years ago, he to lie'
his life, she her own There was neer
the semblance of a quarrel She could
almost hae wished there had been—
anything, all things, but what was
Margaret found herself oerwhelmed
by a tumult of emotions as she sat
in the familiar old fashioned parlor
where so many of her old days had
tjeen spent There was ery little
change beyond the few trifling effects
wrought by the touch of a new Indiid
uality
It was a  quaint, picturesque old
home, a typical architectural relic of
the antebellum south A smooth box
hedge, green the year round, bordered
a magnificent flower garden  Outside
were wild oranges, great rows of thenj,
Whose dainty waxen blossoms of this
season mingled with the glistening gold
fruit of the last otted about the
wide Bermuda lawn were roses, pink
"HT TRAIN WIUj LEAVE IN TWENTY
MIKUTEB," SHB SAI
and white and red and yellow bloomed,
filling the air with midwinter fra
grance
A half hour passed, and, Impatient
of waiting, Margaret rose and walked
oer to one of the windows
There was a tiny artificial pond just
below, with ducks skimming oer Its
rippleless surface Weeping willows
trailed their graceful branches along
the edges where daisies and white io
lets sprang up in profusion
Presently a child with long yellow
curls toddled down to the rim of the
bank and dabbled his fingers in the
water The nurse followed close be
hind, laughing and protesting and try
ing to beguile her young charge away
with a fat, stuffed elephant
The woman turned soul sick at the
sight Here dawned another and a
tragic aspect, all unsuspected
The boy turned an eager, flushed face
and held out both hands, dripping with
crystal drops
It was the face of Richard Kelton In
miniature
"Baby! Baby!"
Margaret started at the sound of a
sweet, weak oice almost at her elbow
and, turning, stood face to face with a
ery young and ery delicate looking
woman But for the deep circles under
the blue eyes and the lines of pain
cared about a sensitie mouth it was
the face of a child
"Oh, I beg your pardon," 6he began,
with an apologetic smile "You are
waiting to see my husband on busi
ness, 1 beliee?"
Margaret nodded
"I completely forgot," the other went
on, with a pretty air of explanation
"I was looking for my boy I always
am when I'm able to be about"
She paused out of sheer weaknesp
and sank into a chair
Margaret made some triial response
and slipped back into her own seat
struggling to regain her poise
What should she do? What could
ahe do? She could neer deal the worse
than deathblow to that poor little girl

With a swift assumption of urgency
she drew her watch from her belt and
started to her feet "I really must not
wait longer," she said hurriedly "My
train will leae in twenty minutes"
"I'm ery sorry," the other said re
gretfully "It's too bad of Richard to
hae caused you all this annoyance, al
though of course It was unintentional
on his part It's nothing ery Impor
tant, I hope?"
"Oh, nothing," replied Margaret, with
a fleeting smile Personal V '
"And your name— you wish to lea
your card, do you not?" ? ',' Personal 
"I hae no card with me Neei
mind about the name It really doesn't
matter Thank you, and— good morn
ing"
She passed quickly down the steep
flight of steps and on down the grae]
path, her head bent
At the gate she glanced up— into the
eyes of Richard Kelton
"Margaret— you— you! For Mercy's
sake!"
She regarded him silently, scornfully
"I thought you were dead," the man
said doggedly
"Excuse me, but you thought no such
thing," she retorted quietly
"Well, and what are you going >to
do about it?" he asked with suddenly
white lips 'Personal'
Margaret Kelton looked at him with
the contempt she could not conceal
"I came," she returned In a low
oice, "to sae a woman from a man's
illainy It was the hardest undertak
ing of my life, but I felt that I could
not be a party to crime by my si
lence"—
'•'You !" he broke in "You hae ruined
me, wrecked my home, my wife's hap
piness, stolen the name from my inno
cent baby!"
"Come, this is no time for heroics
Listen to me I hae done none of
these things of which you accuse me,
though God knows you are not the one
who ought to be spared I hae seen
your 'wife,' your 'Innocent baby,' and
for them, for then* sake, I hae kept
silent"  
He stared at her curiously, disbe
lieingly "Then why did you not think
of these things before and stay away?"
"Why? I will tell you Had I found
your— your wife, as I expected, how
eer happy, howeer Innocent, I must
hae told the truth She would hae
thanked me; not then, perhaps, but
afterward As it Is, I see only a young
girl, dying, and her child— a man—per
haps a real, a great man of the future
For his sake, I want you to remember
that"'  •'
The man had bowed his head At
length he looked up with strangely dim
eyes,
"Thank you," he said simply; "you
hae shown me what true nobility is
I— l shall try to desere it"
Margaret had passed noiselessly
through the open gate, and the rows of
clustering oranges hid her from iew
John Wesley's Quarrel
John Wesley once had a disagree
ment with Joseph Bradford, his trael
ing companion of many years, and
they agreed to part They retired for
the night, each firm In his determina
tion and each doubtless deploring in
his heart the separation soon to follow
between two friends who had been so
deoted and mutually helpful In the
morning Wesley asked Bradford if he
had considered during the night their
agreement to part
"Yes, sir," said Bradford
"And must we part?" inquired Wes
ley
"Please yourself, sir," said Bradford
grimly,
"But will you not ask my' pardon?"
demanded Wesley
"No, sir"
"You won't?"
"No, sir,"
(! In that case," said Wesley gently,
"I must ask yours"
It was not the ending which Brad
ford anticipated, j A moment he hesi
tated, and then, breaking into tears,
he followed Wesley's example and for
gae and was forgien— Youth's Com

Japan's Hairy Alnon
A traeler In Japan thus describes
the hairy Amos of that countryPersonal "The
men are about the middle height, broad
chested, broad shouldered, thick set,
ery strongly built, the arms and legs
short, thick and muscular, the hands
and feet large The bodies, and espe
cially the limbs, of many are coered
with short, bristly hair I hare seen
two boys whose backs are coered with
tar as fine and soft as that of a cat
We were ferried oer a rier by an
Aino completely coered with hair,
which on his shoulders was way like
that of a retrieer and rendered cloth
Ids quite needless either for coering
or for warmth A way black beard
rippled nearly to his waist oer his
furry chest, and with his black locks
hanging in masses oer his shoulders
he would hae looked a thorough sa
age had It not been for the exceeding
sweetness of his smile and eyes"

INVISIBLE LIGHT
Only When II Strikes tbe Retina of
the Eye Can It Be Seen
What is the simplest demonstration
ef the fact that light is inisible?
The blackness of a midnight sky
demonstrates this fact most readily
We may see the planets of the moon
brilliantly illuminated by the sun's
rays, but the surrounding space is
dark, although we know ' that light
must be passing tbere Personal
The passage of  a beam of light
through a darkened room is only isi Personal
ble on the dust in the air, and the cone
of light seen when the sun shines
through a small hole in a shutter is
not isible, but only light reflected
from the motes in the beam This can
be easily and simply demonstrated by
placing in the beam a glass essel
from which the dust has been carefully
remoed The beam then may be seen
before and after entering the essel,
but is inisible within A Bunsen
burner or a redhot poker held so as to
destroy the motes will also render the
beam inisible at that spot
Light is only isible when it strikes
on the retina of the eye, and it can
only do so when It reaches it In a di
rect line or is turned by a reflection or
refraction into a direct line Just as
the bullets from a gun do a man no
harm unless aimed or turned in their
course toward his body, so light is
without effect unless it is aimed or
turned toward the retina— Pearson's

HOW THEY HELP OUT
I All the newspapers in the county,
excepting the Ledger, approes pt
Judge Rust's decision in faor of the
justices and constables That grouchy
old organ opposes anything and eery
thing which ten in any way add a
nickel or two to its taxes Get in and
be cheerful* and help to make your
neighbor happy You cannot take
your dirty old dollars with you into
the land where green liers are un
known Help out! — Echo
We cheerfully republish the aboe
as tending to show what a healthy
kind of a man, morally and mentally
speaking, is running the intellectual
loe feast in the Athens of the foot
hills The Echo is only in its elemen t
when it deliberately falsifies, for the
inherent loe of falsification The
Ledger has neither approed nor
disapproed of Judge Rust's decision
And just now it is actually adocat
ing, while our cotemporaries are op
posing, an addition of a few nickels
to the taxes, by urging an appeal of
the justice salary case to the supreme
court for final adjudication We
are not in faor of stopping at half
way treasures to please anybody It
would be a ery interesting inquiry
to find out how it came about that
all the newspapers in the county
except the Ledger, are so hysteri
cally alarmed lest the matter be
carried to the higher court As for
the implied personal flings at the
editor of the Ledger contained in
the aboe, we are not concerned in
the least It is enough to know that
they are eidently a source of pure
delight to the writer on the princi
ple that "little things please little
minds" We are not sufficiently
ersed in physiology to tell whether
his lier is yellow, green or white;
whether his brain is dislocated or
mislocated; whether his noble
personality is indicatie of the
nobility of soul therein These
things are of no importance to us,
nor to our readers We are pleased
to admit, howeer, that the Ledger
represents the taxpayers of Amador
county, rather than the taxeaters,
and therein lies the difference be
tween this paper and its cotem
poraries We prefer to use our in
fluence to endeaor to ameliorate
the conditions in a taxburdened
community, not to hail as a step in
the right direction eery scheme
that comes aloug to add additional
burdens to an already oppressed
people The nontaxpaying class
cannot be expected to appreciate at
its true alue, the oftimes uphill
task experienced by propertyholders
in meeting the exactions of the go
ernment Some are actually com
pelled to lay by a certain sum eery
month so to be in a position to pay
their taxes as they become due
Any increase of the burden to the
extent of a few dollars means a seri
ous augmentation of the difficulty
And our frugal, honest, industrious
citizens of this class are treated
editorially with disdainful flippancy
as einced in the aboe clipping
What does the newspaper trinity
know or care about such matters
We hae taken the trouble to look
oer the assessment roll of the cr r
rent year to find out the standing of
the editorial fraternity thereon,
thinking perhaps it might afford an
explanation of this don'tcare policy
We find that the sum total of their
taxable property is $1965 This is
distributed as followsPersonal The lone
editor $50 realty, personalty $565;
total $615; our Jackson cotemporary
$1300; all in personal property; our
Sutter Creek editor, who figures on
the minutes of the superisors as
the beneficiare of their patronage,
does not figure on the assessment
roll at all The editor of the Led
ger is called upon to contribute oer
eleen times as much toward carry
ing on the expenses of the county
as all his cotemporaries combined
That accounts for the milk in the
cocoanut '" Help out!" is the cry of
the combine, with acts to correspond
therewith People would be apt to
think more faorably of their efforts
if they would help the inflow as well
as the outflow of the public treas
ury
emocracy is in bad shape It is
I ery doubtful whether the party can
pull itself together to make a re
spectable showing in the national
contest next year Between look
, ing for a candidate and trying; to
beadoff candidates that are hunting
I a nomination, they are kept pretty
busy Hearst wants it badly; the
party don't seem to hanker after
him to any great extent They fear
he would hoodoo them The Bryan
ites are out for the scalps of the
Cleelanders, who are dubbed party
• wreckers The Cleelands think
the Bryan crowd are the smashers
In this state of demoralization they
are looking around for outside help
They are coquetting with the labor
organizations With the labor
strength thrown into their side of
the political balance they imagine
they, would hae some chance to win
Whether such an unseemly alliance
can be brought about is doubtful
Anyhow democracy is in distress
The jail deliery at Folsom state
prison last Monday, in which eleen
longterm and desperate conicts
made good their escape, taking with
them a number of officials as protec
tion against attack, shows a ery
lax and defectie state of affairs in
the management of that institution
One guard lost his life, and two
others were seerely, perhaps mor
tally wounded in the outbreak The
circumstances call for a thorough
inestigation Something must be
loose, when a band of eleen  con
icts are found together armed with
weapons of their own fashioning, and
their guards are caught at the same
time unharmed and • defenseless It
would also seem ery strange that
so many prisoners could, under the
regulations of tbe prison, drop out
from the line as the men were pass
ing to their work, without arousing
suspicion This stepping from the
ranks is explained that it was cus
tomary for those against whom com
plaints had been made, to stop at
the captain's office, where the
charges \ were inestigated This
custom made this unparalleled jail
break not only possible, but easy of
accomplishment ue regard for
safety ought to suggest to the ordi
nary mind that any stepping aside
from the ranks in a file of conicts
on the march, should hae no other
meaning than a reolt But at Fol
som it was an eeryday occurrence,
A thing so common that it was pass
ed unnoticed Fortunately tbe
eleen escapes did not^ realize how
completely they had captured the
prison and their guards, otherwise
they might hae turned loose the
whole outfit of seeral hundred
prisoners kept at Folsom The ab
sence of a wall around the prison is
a poor excuse for this escape A
wall might help to ward off such an
outbreak, but the fact remains that
it ought not to hae been possible
een in the absence of a wall The
conicts kept together until they
had exchanged their prison garb
and secured proisions and supplies,
and then disbanded Most of them
will doubtless be either killed or
captured; the chances are that some
of them will neer be retaken It
is matter of common talk that
politics hae too much to do with
our penal institutions, and this
calamity tends to strengthen that

Enrico Ginocchio, after a long battle
with surTering and disease, died Sunday
night at about 11 o'clock The last
enemy came to him clothed in garb of
friendship, as it does in fact to all
whose ital forces are slowly under
mined by the inroads of physical de
cay For seeral years he had been a
sufferer from paralysis, the malady
finally inoling the power of speech
as well as motion Until the last few
weeks he was accustomed to take an
outing almost daily in his buggy, of
course in charge of a relatie, for
exercise and fresh air, wheneer the
weather would permit To all who
saw him, it was eident that his hold
on life was gradually loosening, and
that the figure which has been so
prominently identified with the social
and business life of Jackson for the
past 40 years, was soon to pass from
earthly iew foreer Medical skill,
both local and in the city, was called to
his aid, and no doubt helped to pro
long his days, and also aided ma
terially in smoothing his pathway
to the grae The end was not un
expected to his relaties, and we might
add was not unwelcome to the afflicted
one
eceased was born in Italy on March
14, 1838 When only sixteen years of
age he left his natie land with the in
tention of caring out his own path in
the world In 1853 he sailed for Cali
fornia, and first settled at Bear rier in
Mariposa county, where he took up a
placer claim Not haing arried at
the age of full manhood, he was then
allowed by the local customs of the
miners only onehalf claim He con
tinued working in that county until
1857, with arying fortune When the
Fra9er rier excitement broke out he
was attracted thither, and this enture
proed disastrous, and he returned to
California About 1860 he came to
Amador county, and purchased an
interest in the firm of Bruno and
Curotto Thereafter he became the
sole proprietor, at the same location
where the business has eer since been
conducted In 1806 he sent for his
brother Alphonse, and the firm of
Ginocchio Brothers was formed, and
has continued uninterruptedly until
dissoled by the decree of death For
40 years the deceased and the firm of
which he was the head, has enjoyed a
reputation for uprightness, business
sagacity, and liberal dealings, which
has made the house known and respect
ed in commercial circles throughout
the state I l&T) he was united in
marriage to Mrs Julia Baggjo Fie
children were born tp them, ppe son
and four daughters The son Joseph
died in 1899 at the age of 10 years
This bereaement was keenly felt by
the griefstricken parents, the father's
health beginning to decline soon there
after The four daughters Rosa,
(wife pf Frank Podesta), Lena, (Mrs
Frank Burgjni, Henrietta, (M rs  Fred
Entity) and Julia, and also, the deoted
wife who so tenderly nursed him
through the days of his helplessness,
remain to deplore his death
The funeral took place Wednesday
morning, and was one of the largest at
tended eer se^q fjfire Not only in
Jackson was the news al tba pi^nser
merchant's death receied in sadness,
but from all parts of this and Calaeras
county, as well as San Francisco and
other distant cities, came many friends

memory of the jdeeessedj and offer ex
pressions of sympathy to the zarro>
burdened family The Pioneers, Natie

LOCAL MINING NEWS
Notes From Amador County Mines
Lincoln Closes own— Fremont
Mill Hearing Completion
MOORE— Captain Neills, while in
Jackson the other day, stated that all
arrangements for the starting of work
on this property had been completed
Timbers necessary for the repair of 500
feet of shaft were ready in Stockton,
and could be shipped to the mine in a
few days The money necessary to ex
plore the property was also on hand,
and the owners were anxious to pro
ceed to work, and find out the gold
bearing quality of the lode in that
locality The uncertainty of the labor
situation was the only drawback If a
guarantee could be gien that the de
elopment of the mine would not be
marred by interference of organized
labor, he was ready to gie order to
start at once , As things stand at
present, he did not feel justified in
starting up The truth is, the labor
union of Jackson is now under con
seratie management It ia, we be
liee, doing its utmost to allay the feel
ing of uncertainty and lack of con
fidence in financial circles, the outcome
of the late strike There may be a few
extremists, as there always are and
perhaps always will be, in such bodies,
but the right spirit is in control The
focus of discontent is shifted from Jack
son, and the agitation elsewhere is ha
ing its effect on the mining industry
throughout the county
Grand Prize— G A Andrews, who
accompanied a shipment of one car
load of ore from this mine to the re
duction works ia the city, has return
ed It is reported that the ore went
$90 per ton, and the shipment, em
braced 13 tons Work at the mine is
being pushed ahead The shaft below
the tunnel leel is being sunk in the
ore body It is now 80 feet below the
tunnel, and the intention is to follow it
down to 100 feet The ore body holds
out well, and eery indication tends to
confirm the Gpimoa' that jit will con
tinue to a considerably greater depth
Horn — At this mine, near the e
fender, work is at a standstill at
present The face of the tunnel shows
a ledge of com] looking quartz about
two feet thick, with a small seam of
gougelike material on either side The
ledge has widened out within the last
few feet from six inches to two feet,
with eery reason to beliee that it
will continue to widen as the tunnel is
pushed ahead Work on the tunnel
will be resumed as supp $3 financial ar
rangements can be made to thtt end
Climax — This mine has beon bond
ed to r P B Aiken and other parties
from the city, who are now engaged in
deelopment work thereon The prop
erty was formerly known as the Reed
& Askey Some ery rich rock was
taken therefrom years ago, but foi a
number of years jt has been idle
Fremont— The construction of the
40 stamp mill is proceeding satisfactori
ly The building is approaching com
pletion, and a portion of the machinery
is on the ground ready to be put in
plt£e, The gallows frame is also fin
ished a 9 far as the c&ipentep lfqrk ie

Lincoln — A meeting of the direct
ors of this company was held early in
the week, at which it was definitely
decided to close down The work of
taking up the track is now in progress
This may take a couple of weeks to
finish, at the end of which time the
property will reert to (idleness The
company hae expended in the neigh
borhood of $200,000 in prospecting
They hae searched it thoroughly,
and used good judgment and economy
in al} thc Qperijtipns They do not feel
justified in' continuing the work "i 1

of the Lincoln, was present, also Mr

LABOR UNION SITUATION
Friction Continues Between Western
Federation and American Feder
ation Organizations
John C Williams of Neada county,
who is ice president of the Western
Federation of Miners, has been in the
county for the past week, looking into
the labor situation in this county The
object of his isit is mainly to endeaor
to get the engineers and others of the
arious mines who are now organized
under the banner of the American
Federation to join the Western Federa
tion The principal point of friction is
the mines around Amador City Mr
Williams has Interiewed C R owns,
superintendent of the Bunker Hill,
Arthur Goodall, superintendent of the
Fremont, and others in regard to the
matter Some ery disquieting re
ports wore in circulation in reference
to the substance of these interiews,
giing the impression that further
labor troubles were pending That
impression predominates around Ama
dor City Special meetings hae been
held there the past week, also a' meet
ing in Sutter Creek, to which the mem
bers of the American Federation were
inited, was held Sunday eening
This was addressed by Mr Williams,
who stated the position of his organiza
tion, and cordially inited them to
identify themseles wlth the organiza
tion which he represented
Among the mine owners and business
men generally, especially in the central
part of the county, the feeling of un
rest has been greatly increased On
Wednesday Mr Williams was in Jack
son, and the editor of the Ledger aail
ed himself of tho opportunity of inter
iewing him He stated the object of
his mission was nqt stride A^ strike
was the farthest from their intentions;
no special meeting had been called for
the 10th of August to ote on a strike
proposition
The situation seems to be about as
followsPersonal
The Western Federation contends
that the mining sectiun is their special
field; they do not inade the p|tles,
leaing that field for the American
Federation and otherorganizations It
is necessary to maintain their position,
they claim, to hae the engineers of all
the miqes within t*}eir jurisdiction in
their organization When asked what
was meant by the expression, "to
maintain our position," the answer
was, "to endeaor to improe the con
ditions of those employed in and around
the mines" There was no objection
to engineers and others belonging to
the American Federation as well, but
they had to hae them in their union
In other words, they wanted to domi
nate the situation
The American Federation men on
tho other hand are satisfied to remain
where they are They do not want to
belong to two labor organizations The
mine owners will not discriminate
either for or against them on account of
belonging to either uniqn tq no
union We understand the time gien
in which all those working in and
around the mines of the Amador dis
trict are to join the Western Federa
tion has open extended, tq the 18, th of
Augqst Wb,at will occur then in case
they fail to join is not said All idea of
strike is repudiated by the leaders A
strike is the furthest from their
thoughts they say But the impression
left upQn the minds of the representa
ties of tho mines Is that the miners of
the Western Federation, while not de
claring a strike, will decline to work
with those nonmembers A demand
for the discharge of nonunion men, or
American Federation men, if met
with a refusal, followed by a re
fusal of the others to work, a jalkout
or a lpckput, is likely' to "be the out
come, resulting in ajieup of the mines
inoled, unless qther men can be got
to operate them The outlook is any
thing b,ut reasstyriug,

ouble Homicide at Ban Andreas
A lamentable affair occurred at San
Andreas last Sunday, resulting in the
death of two men— one James Casey,
who was acting as deputy constable at
the time It seems that a man named
Martinez was intoxicated, and was gi
ing some trouble on the outskirts of the
town Casey went out to arrest him,
the offender submitting without any
show of resistance He took him to the
county jail, and with the aid of deputy
sheriff Thorn was about to search him
for weapons, when the prisoner sud
denly pulled a reoler and commenced
shooting at Casey, firing seeral shots
at close range Casey was killed in
stantly Thorn then engaged in a life
ordeath tussle with the 'desperado,
hitting him oer the head with a din
ner bucket Tho prisoner broke loose,
andescaped tq the street, and made
haste out of town The news of the
killing spread quickly, and the three
brothers of the dead officer, armed
with pistols, took the trail of the fugi
tie He was still disposed to show
fight, so the Caseys opened fire and
dropped him at the first olley He
was mortally wounded, and coneyed
back to town
James Casey, the official ictim of
the killing, was in Jackson last year
duringthetimethatCasey, his brother,
was running the Central hotel His
taking off at the hands of a, desperado,
while doing bis official duty, Is deeply

JACKSON, CAL., July 30, 1903
Mr T K Norman,

 I am in receipt of a petition signed

any game of faro, monte, roulette,

half, twentyone, hokeypokey, or any
banking or percentage game played
with cards, dice," or any deice, for

First Women on the English Stage
It is only with the restoration drama
that the annals of actresses on the
English stage begin Queen Henrietta
Maria, wife of Charles 1, had early
made a ain attempt to introduce the
French fashion of female players into
her adopted country by the establish
ment of a French company composed
only of women in London But the ex
periment was premature, and the for
eigners were hissed and pelted off the
stage at their first performance 
Until 1660 the female parts had al
ways been taken by boys, and the cus
tom suried een after women had
taken their place upon the stage, since
some of the more famous of the boy
actors (grown into men) continued oc
casionally to play their faorite roles
as late as the end of the seenteenth
century Kynaston, the chief boy actor,
suried till 1699, long after the ladles
had ousted him from the principal
parts, and in 1661 Pepys, who saw him
in the "Silent Woman," speaks of him
as "the lieliest lady for a boy" he had
eer seen
Adice
The best adice that can be gien
probably isPersonal Take all the adice you
can get and then do as you please The
successful person, or the one whom the
crowd counts successful, is being con
stantly besieged with applications for
adice how to succeed He is generally
incapable of giing it The same ad
ice, outside of a few maxims gener
ally applicable, is seldom good for two
persons Adice, as a rule, is cheap
and about as aluable as most cheap
things To be constantly following ad
ice without stopping to consider its
source is the plain mark of weakness
It is this trait of weak human nature
which makes the business of the pat
ent medicine maker so profitable The
person of power is the one who neither
gies nor takes adice in generous
quantities The world would be better
off if adice were much less plentiful
Then, perhaps, its quality might rise in
proportion to its scarcity — New Lon
don Telegraph
Sleep
Sleep begins, in its first phase, by a
state of distraction which brings on
states of absent mindedness accompa
nied always by numerous and separate
hallucinations closely connected with
the length of the absent minded states
Immediately afterward, in a second
phase, these states of distraction pass
into a ery delicate motor disturbance,
due to the absence of parallelism in
the axes of the eyes or by the deia
tion of their conjugate moements
Then, in a third and final phase, which
indicates the ery near approach of
actual sleep, the asomotor system
seems to conform to laws ery differ
ent from those that regulate its mech
anism during waking hours— Reue

A Gentleman
What is it to be a gentleman? Is it
to hae lofty alms, to lead a pure life,
I to keep your honor irgin, to hae the
 esteem of your fellow citizens and the
i loe of your fireside, to bear good for
tune meekly, to suffer eil with con
 stancy, and through eil and good to
; maintain truth always? Show me the
j Happy man whose life exhibits these
i qualities, and him we will salute as
gentleman, whateer his rank may be
 Show me the prince who possesses
 them, and he may be sure of our loe

Slgnor Ardltl tells the following story
In his autobiographyPersonal "uring my first
long stay in America our company was
anuounced for one night, during a ter
ribly cold winter, at Washington Shall
I eer forget the bitter cold of that sea
son? It was as though we had sudden
ly been transported to the arctic  re
gions, and the theater In which we had
our performance was as inadequate to
cope with the frost as though we bad
fixed up a summer tent for the purpose
'Xorma' was the opera, and Grisi, in
ttead of appearing in her traditional
white robe with flowing folds, was
compelled to come on the stage wear
ing a huge fur cloak in which she was
huddled up almost to ber eyes The
house only really rose to the occasion
with loud bursts of laughter when
Mario made his entrance holding a
coachman's umbrella oer his head —
he, as Polllo, being confronted by Nor
ma in their tragical meeting — under
which prosaic safeguards both artists
cowered while singing their grand duo
The roof of the theater had gien way
under the weight of a heay fall of
snow, • and its coating of ice, melting
under the heat of the gas, was stream
ing down on the artists"
Ancient Ideas of Africa,
, In mediaeal times_ Africa was an
unknown continent as well as Asia
Until a few years after the discoery
of Columbus no one had sailed around
it, and It was quite generally thought, I
as it had preiously been thought in j
regard to Asia, that the African contl 
nent extended on and on indefinitely
It was supposed that far to the south
was the zone of heat, in which no hu
man' being could lie This was by no
means an unreasonable inference to
the ancients They knew that the far
ther they sailed to the" north the' colder
it grew and that in the extreme north
was a region of perpetual ice and snow
They also knew that the farther they
sailed to the south the warmer it grew,
and what was more natural for them
to suppose that if they went far enough
in that direction they would come upon
lands that were parched and baked
and upon seas that boiled, where noth
ing could lie but salamanders?
He Conld Wield an Ax
 Queer and racy are the tales told of
the skill of the Maine shipbuilders in
the use of the adz and broadax One
old time yarn is of a carpenter who ap
plied ery drunk at a shipyard for em
ployment In order to hae a little fun
with him the foreman set him to gie a
proof of his skill by hewfng out a
wooden bolt with no chopping block
but a stone The carpenter accomplish
ed his difficult task without marring
the keen edge of the broadax and
showed the foreman a neatly made
bolt Then he brought the ax down
with a terrific blow that shattered its
edge upon the stone "I can hew fust
rate on your chopping block," he hic
coughed, "but I'll be blamed if I can
make the ax stick in it when I git
through" The story runs that the
foreman lost no time in employing
such a workman
How the Patent Office Was Saed
When in the war of 1812 the British,
who had taken Washington, trained
their guns upon the patent office, ' r
Thornton, throwing himself directly
before the guns, criedPersonal
"Are you Englishmen or Ootbs and
Vandals? This is the patent office— a
depository of the ingenuity and inen
tions of the American nation, in which
the whole ciilized world is interested
Would you destroy it? Then let the
charge pass through my body"
And the building was spared Twen
tyfour years afterward, howeer, it
was destroyed by fire, together with

If there had not been a wedding at
620 Granille aenue, there might not
hae been one exactly two months lat
t at 325, just across the way
The wedding had been the finest that
the pretty southern town had seen for
many a day Now that it was oer
there was a small brigade of caterers
aad florists' assistants scurrying about
packing up cut glass and candelabra
and shoing camp chairs and portable
palms into prosaic carts Alice oro
thy, ' flattening her little nose against
the window pane in the house oppo
site in her eagerness to see the ery
last ol it, sighed regretfully
Last night, for one brief, blissful mo
ment, mamma had held her up to kiss
the bride In all her glory, of eil and
flowers and shimmerig satin Then
she had been hurried home with Hep
zy
And this morning there was nothing
left of it all but a few wilted chrysan
themums scattered on the walk and a
trail of rice across the lawn The beau
tiful dream had anished; but, oh, how
THE CHIL GAZE AT SIM VEBT SERIOUSLY
AN VEBY CRITICAMjX
she longed to hae a wedding of her
ery own! Mamma had gone out, but
perhaps Hepzy would talk to her about
it again
Hepzy, the good natured, was in the
upper room making beds Alice oro
thy sped upstairs as fast as her dimin
utie legs would carry her
"Oh, Hepzy," she burst out, her
bright face rosy with running and ar
dent interest, "won't mamma let us
hae a wedding some time too?"
"Bress yo' heart, honey, dar couldn't
be no weddln' 'tuout a bride nohow!"
"But, Hepzy, mamma could be that
She's more prettier 'n Miss Edif"
Hepzy's fat sides began to heae as
she pfllted a pillow into its proper ro
tundity, her black palm silhouetted
against its snowy, beruffled coering
"I don' reckon, chile, yo' maw's much
notion o' marryin' ag'ln, seeln' she's
hed one cl'ar 'scape"
"What's a cl'ar 'scape, Hepzy?"
"Lawd bress de chile! It ain't nuthin'
dat consuns one liin' soul but hu'self,
honey An' howsomeer dar ain't neah
bin no weddin' 'thout a brid'groom,
shuah's yo' bawn, 111' gal"
"A bwidegoom?"
"Yaas, chile; suttin' shuah—de pus
son wot stan' nex' de bride an' hoi' hu'
bokay while she am afas'nen of hu'
glub"
Alice orothy was silent for a brief
instant in the face of this unlooked for
obstacle Then, with a ; thoughtful
pucker on the little forehead, "P'raps
we could get one Hepzy"
"Now yo' is ofT'n de trac' III* gal
ar ain't no gittin' 'bout it He jus'
come, an' come hisself till by an' by he
leabe off acomin' an' teks de bride off
to his own residumps"
"Oh," explained the perplexed little
questioner, with a dimpling smile of
illumination, "Mr onal' comes nearly
eery day ~ P'raps he would be th'
bwidegoom!"
"Fo' heaben's sake, chile, wot am de
mattab wif yo' sawsh dat yo' maw
done tie so scrumptious 'fore she done
gone out? It's adraggin' on de flo
lak a monkey's talll"
The little girl laughed gleefully at
the picture Hepzy had successfully
turned the drift of conersation, which,
as she declared to Mann Smith that
afternoon with numerous fat chuckles,
she felt " 'bleeged to do, fo' de bressed
chile was gittin' too pussonal"
Mamma and Alice orothy had been
swinging to and fro in the big rocker
for a long time that eening When
the little girl, nestling closer, had asked
in her sweet, lisping fashion if they
couldn't hae a wedding some time like
Miss Edlfs, an' did she flnk that Mr
onal' would come, too, 'cause Hep
y said there couldn't be none 'thout a
bwidegoom, mamma had kissed her
quickly on the mouth and told her
neer, neer to say anything like that
again '•'''
"And mamma's little girl must be
ery quiet, too, when— anybody calls,
because"— with a half sigh— "mamma's
afraid that— Mr onald doesn't like

Nelson bad just receied word that her
sou had been killed and "would Mrs
Cranston come oer for | awhile until
her sister could get there"
Alice orothy had a tiny scheme
tucked away in her actie little brain
She was pleased when mamma j had
turned on the lights and told her she
might "sit up" awhile in the big rocker
It was ery still in the, house after
mamma had gone, and the small eye
lids drooped heaily Then the bell
rang again, and the half closed eyes
flew wide open as their owner gae a
quick little breath Personal ,
Yes, she was sure he would come!
There he stood looking down at the
round, frizzly head He was saying
something about finding her alone! He
Was big and broad shouldered, and his
eyes were smiling at her j
The child gazed at him ery seriously
and ery critically for a moment, and
then the dimples broke
"I fought p'raps you'd come," she
said, looking up at him ecstatically
"You were looking for me, then?",
"Yes I wanted t* ask if you'd be
th' bwidegoom at our wedding an'
stan' "by the cuttings wif th' bu'ful
bwide!"
"Whose wedding, Alice * orothy?
Yours?" There was a note of eager
curiosity in the questioning oice •  
"Yes; mine an', mamma's Hepzy
says we mus' hae a bwidegoom like
Miss Edlf had, an' I fought p'raps
you'd be it!"
He lifted the child in his arms and
sat down in the roomy rocker \
Alice orothy nestled close to him
confidingly He was not smiling now,
but the child's quick instinct told her
that he could be relied upon She liked
Mr onald ery much
"An' my mamma she fought we
could neer hae a bu'ful wedding
'cause p'raps you don't like little gulls,
an' it made her sorry to fink 'bout
that" r^uJ
"id she say that little one?"
"No, she dint say it; she on'y is
pered" L??i
Mr onald sat up ery straight He
seemed to forget that Alice orothy
was there
It was ery uncomfortable sitting
like that And what did jhe mean
when he kissed her hair so suddenly
and called her a little "angel of light",
and said that he understood now— it
was quite clear— and he hoped they
would all be ery happy yet
And now he was holding her tight In
hia arms, his brown cheek close to her
soft pink one, rocking slowly to and
fro In spite of eerything the drowsy
eyelids would drop oer the happy,
sleepy eyes
"An' It will— beth' mos' bu'fulest

I do not know whether It was from

now and then Farrar had an unfortu
nate habit of mechanically repeating
himself uring one term, when this
habit was at its worst, we used to hae
weekly lessons in the Septuagint, in
eery other erse of which the Greek
words for "word" and "work" are In
terchanged Regularly eery Monday
morning he used to explain this confu
sion in these words, "The reason why
'ergon* is used here instead of 'logos'
is that It is a translation of the Hebrew
word abar, which means both word
and thing" Those four last monosyl
lables used to boom forth like Big Ben
striking four or like the sound of two
great amens j One Monday morning
Thersites, who sat next to me, whis
pered in my earPersonal "We hae not had
abar yet Shall I get it?" I replied,
"o if you dare" And he unblushing
ly asked why "ergon" was used instead
of "logos" in the passage which had
just been translated "Ah!" said our
reered master "You could not be
expected to know that But the rea
son," etc It came out erbatim He
walked with stately tread straight into
the open trap Thersites remained

After beating a merry tattoo on the

"Come here, my dear See, It looks

iSanlu of Students
A book by Captain Markharn of the
British army tells of experiences iri
Westminster school, London, some
thing oer half a century ago He de
scribes the "handings" of those days
The back of the hand was extended,
while the master, standing behind,
smote it with a rod, which "curled oer
a little" and left a cut, and the culprit,
facing the school, obsered the eti
quette of the occasion by wearing an
expression of "scornful amusement"
Captain Markham also describes "tan
ning," which was administered with
the butt end of a rod upon the backs of
the boys' legs He recalls the code of
honor, which was merciless to the boy
who broke his word or allowed another
to suffer for his offense, but permitted
"any amount of humbugging of a mas
ter" When disinclined for school you
said, "I don't feel ery well, sir," and
before the master inspected your
tongue you gae "the upper surface a
hard pressure with your upper teeth,
and out came a tongue white enough to
satisfy any doctor"
Underground Waters
The earth contains an abundance of
water, een in places like some of our
great western plateaus where the sur
face is comparatiely arid The great
est depth at which underground water
can exist is estimated to be about six
miles Below j that it is belieed, the
caities and pores of the rock are com
pletely closed \ The amount of water
in the earth's crustPersonal is reckoned at
nearly a third of that contained in the
oceans, so that it would coer the
whole surface of the globe to a depth
of from 3,000 to 3,500 feet The waters
underground flow horizontally after
sinking below the unsaturated zone of
the rocks, but in the sands of the a
kota formation, which supply remark
able artesian wells', the motion does
not exceed one or two miles a year
The underflow toward the sea beneath
the great plains may sometimes take
the form of broad streams or moing
sheets of water, but the moement is
excessiely slow— Youth's Companion
Indians Hae Hard Teeth
 "I don't care for Indians as patients,"
said a dentist the other day "No; it
isn't that they are objectionable per
sonally; it is just because there is no
money to be made out of them at regu
lar rates The hardness of an Indian's
tooth is something to marel at, and
if I had many of them to treat I should
be forced to hae instruments of un
usual strength made to order The
ordinary kind won't stand the pressure
I filled one caity in a red man's tooth
the other day, and before I got through
I had turned the edges of no less than
twenty drills There isn't much money
In that sort of work, Is there? And
talk about the Indian's aunted stoi
cism and imperiousness to pain! Why,
that fellow yelled eery time I touched
him! I'e had sixyearold children be
hae better in the chair"—Philadel

Sentiment Versus Fact
That the adance preparation of
speeches will not always conform to
circumstances was made eident dur
ing a flag raising at a public school
The young orator had been speaking
for seeral minutes when he adanced
to the front of the platform, raised his
hand with a dramatic gesture to the
flag on the staff aboe him and shoutedPersonal
"See yon flag throwing its protecting
folds to the breeze of freedom!"
Mt was a pretty sentiment, but the
"breeze" didn't bear out the picture
The flag, to which all eyes were imme
diately turned, hung as limp as if it
had been dipped in water
Grieances
Eery day in the year the aerage
man has a grieance On the last day
In the year he has probably forgotten
the other 364  A _ \
Three hundred and sixtyfie days in
the year he has poured his particular
grieance into the ears of some poor
deil who has troubles of his own

the kicking— and gie him cause

Oer His Patient's Head
When the doctor, who forgot what
kind of medicine his patient was tak
ing, asked, "Was it a fluid medicament
I prescribed for you the last time?" the
puzzled German patient answeredPersonal
