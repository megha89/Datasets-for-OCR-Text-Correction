Method to Recoer It
"If some, scheme could be deised,"
said a Stlllwater (Minn) man, "by
which the sunken logs wlfich fill the
beds of riers and creeks in the log
ging sections of this country could only
be recoered, immense fortunes would
be made Along the St Croix waters it
Is estimated that logs enough are im
bedded in the sand of rier bottoms to
keep mills running for years.  Under
present conditions the loss is total, for
no successful method has eer been de
ised to effect this saing
"Occasionally logs cut years ago are
forced by the washings of (loeds from
their sand beds and drien upon the
shores, where the action of sun and
wind dries them out sufficiently so that
they Personal will ' float down  stream, but the
percentage of logs recoered Is small,
and millions of dollars' worth of prop
erty is lost beyond recoery until some
enterprising genius inents a machine
or process to recoer the timber
"At Stillwater logs 'occasionally come
to the sorting booms bearing marks In
use half a century ago, and when they
appear the old lumbermen grow remi
niscent of men who hae been long
forgotten, but who were important
operators in the pioneer logging days
of Wisconsin and Minnesota
• "No possible estimate can be made
of the amount of timber thus lost, but
lumbermen estimate that the riers of
Wisconsin, in the alue of 'the logs
buried in their sands, hae fortunes of
millions of dollars if the logs could bo
recoered  Wisconsin has been one of
the big pine states, and your Chip
pewa, Wisconsin, St Croix and Me
nominee riers and their tributaries
contain fortunes in sunken timber
"Strange as it may appear, the alue
of the timber is not lessened, een after
Jt has been submerged for half or
quarter of a century Efforts hae been
occasionally made to recoer sunken
logs At one time a company was or
ganized at Stillwater to dredge streams
an{l thus recoer some of the timber,
but the plan did not work with any
great degree , of success, this method
being found too expensie Some one
will come along some clay with a plan,
and this immensely aluable product,

TRIBUTES TO WIVES
WORS OF TENERNESS UTTERE
BY GREAT MEN
The Homage That Tom Hood Paid to
the Partner of Ills Sorrows and
Joys— Jean Paul UKliter's Unstint
Ed Praise of Caroline Mayer
Few great men hae paid more t>n<
thusiastic tributes to their wies than
Tom Hood, and probably few wies
hae better desered such homage, says
the Chicago Chronicle "You will
think," he wrote to her in one of his
letters, "that I am more foolish than
any boy loer, and I plead guilty, for
neer was a wooer so youug of heart
and so steeped in loe as I, but it is a
loe sanctified and strengthened by
long years of experience May God
eer bless my darling, the sweetest,
most helpful, angel who eer stooped
to bless a muni" Has there eer,' we'
wonder, lied a wife to whom a more
delicate and beautiful tribute was paid
than those erses of which the burden
Is, "I loe thee, I loe thee; 'tis all that
I can say?"
"I want thee much," Nathaniel Haw
thorne wrote to his wife many years
after his long patience had won for
him the flower "that was lent from
heaen to show the possibilities of the
human soul" "Thou art the only per
son in the world that eer was neces
sary to me, and now I am only myself
when thou art within my reach Thou
art an unspeakably beloed woman"
Sophia Hawthorne was little better
than a chronic inalid, and it may be
that this physical weakness woke all
the deep chialry and tenderness of the
man And he reaped a rich reward for
an almost unrialed deotion in the
"atmosphere pf loe and happiness and
inspiration" with which his delicate
wife always surrounded him
The wedded life of Wordsworth with
his cousin, "the phantom of delight,"
was a poem more exquisitely beautiful
than any his pen eer wrote Mrs
Wordsworth was neer fair to look
upon, but she had that priceless and
rarer beauty of soul which made her
life "a center of sweetness" tp all
firqund her "AIJ that she has been to
me," the poet onco said in his latter
days, "none but^ God and myself can
eer know," and it would be difficult
to find a more touching and beautiful
picture in the gallery of great men's
lies than that of Wordsworth and his
wife, both bowed under the burden of
many years and almost blind, "walking
hund In hand together In the garden,
with all the blissful absorption and
tender confidence pf youthful lpers
|t neer needed' "the welding touch
pf ' a great sorrow" to make the lies
p,f Tait and his deoted
Wife "a perfect whole" Speaking of
her many years after §he had been
taken from him, he said, "To part from
ben, if only for a day, was a pain only
less intense than tho pleasures with
which I returned to her, and 'when?!
took her with me it was one of the
purest Joys gleu to a man to watch
the meeting between her and our chll
dren"
When aid Liingstone had 'passed
his thirtieth birthday, with barely a
thought for such "an indulgence as
wooing and wedding," he declared hu
morously that when he was a llttU
less busy lie wpuld send homo an ad
ertisement for a wife, "prof era bly Personal
decent sort of widow," and yet so un
consciously near was his fate that onlj
a year later he was introducing hit
bride, Mary Moffat, to the home he ha£
built, largely with his own bands, at
Mabotsa From that "supremely hap
py hour" to the day when, eighteen
years later, he receied, her "last falul
Whisperings'' at Shupanga, no man eer
had a more self sacrificing, brae, "de
oted wife than the • missionary's
daughter In fact, they were more like
two happy, light hearted children ihyn
sedate married folk, and under the
magic of their merriment the hard
ships and dangers of life in the heart
pf the' dark continent were stripped of
all their terrors
Jean Paul Richter confessed that he
neer een suspected the potentialities
of human happiness until he met Caro
line Mayer, "that sweetest and most
gifted of women," wheu he was fast
approaching his fortieth year, and that
he hai| no monopoly of the resultant
happiness Is proed by his wife's dec
laration that "Mehter is the pnrest, the
holiest the most godlike man that lies;
•  to be the wife of such a man
Is the greatest glory that can fall to a
woman," while of his wife Klchter
once wrote, "I thought when I married
her that I had sounded the depths of
human loe, but I hae since realized
how unfathomable Is the heart in
which a noble woman has her shrine"
Out Went the Bandbox
Lord Ellenborough, the great English
judge, was once about to go on circuit
When Lady Ellenborough said that she
should like to accompany him He re
plied that he had no objection, proided
she did not Incumber the carriage with
bandboxes, Personal which were his utter ab
hprpenpp purlng the first day's jour
ney Lord Ellenborough, happening to
stretch his legs, put his foot through
something below the seat He disco
ered that It was a bandbox Up went
the window and out went the band
box The coachman stopped, and th
footman, thinking that the bandbox
bad tumbled out of the window> by
Spme extraordinary chance, was going
%a pick it up when Lord EHenborougfc
furiously called out, "rie on!" The
bandbox accordingly was left by the
ditch side Hajng reached the coun
try town where he was to officiate as
Judge, Lord Ellenborough proceeded to
array himself for his appearance in thd
courthouse "Now," said he, "where'a
my wig— where Is my wig?" "Mj

thrown out of the carriage window"

A SAFE IET RULE
Bat the Smallest Amount, of Food
That Will Presere Health
How shall one determine how much
food to eat? Too much mystery has
been thrown about this subject.  Let
your sensationß decide It muet be kept
In mind that the entire function of di
gestion and assimilation is carried on
without conscious superision or con
currence It should be entirely unfelt
and unknown, excepting by the feeling
of bien etre which accompanies and
follows  its normal  accomplishment
Satiety Is bad It implies a sensation
of fullness in the region of Personal the stosa
ach, and that means that too much
food  has Personal been taken The 'exact ' cor^
rcspondence In a healthy animal ; be
tween the appetite and the amount of
food required is extraordinary'; As a'
rule, the meal, unless eaten ery slow
ly, should cease before the  appetite Is
entirely satisfied, because a little time
is required for the outlying organs and
tUtsues  to feel the effects of; the^food
that has been ingested "If too little haa
been taken, it Is easy enough to make
It up at the next meal, and the appe
tite will be only the better and the food
more grateful
No one was eer sorry for haing
oluntarily eaten too little, while mil
lions eery day repent haing eaten too
much It has been said that the great
lesson homeopathy taught the world
was this— that whereas physicians had
been in the habit of giing the patient
the largest dose he could stand, they
hae been led to see that their purpose
was better subsered by giing him
the smallest dose that would produce
the desired effect And so it is with
food Instead of eating, as most peo
ple unfortunately do, as much as they
can, they should eat the smallest
amount that will keep them in good
health— Roger S Tracy in Century
THE MINISTER'S WIFE

The minister's wife exercises th
statesmanship necessary to, maintain a
well ordered and cultured home on a

She sets a fashion in becoming dress
which tones up the taste of many of
her parishioners whose husbands' in
comes are two or three times as large
as the minister's salary She is the
pastor and the actual head of the too
numerous women's and children'sor
ganizations In the church, and she man
ages to keep most of thp Jealousies of
their leaders, from coming to the sur
face,  She listens sympathetically to
the confidences of the young women of
the congregation," and the small wed
ding fees which occasionally fall Into
her lap are meager wages for all the
time and thought she has gien and
the teas she has sered to bring about
these weddings— serices which her
neighbors may laugh at, but which are
the most delicate and aluable of all
ministries when they issue in happy
homes
She knows the pains, the Joys and
the sorrows of motherhood, and she has
strcngthrwd the courage of many a
shrinking wife faltering on the thresh
old of an unknown realm When she
has closed the eyes of the flarjlng of
her heart in t,hp last sleep she goes
out tp cu'eor weary watchers by sick
beds and to gie her silent sympathy
to mourners who will not be comfort
ed She holds her queenly way in po
erty, trial and not seldom under un
kind and unjust criticism, and as she
grows older a light radiates from her
•patient face which moes discerning
friends who otherwise would pity her

"I am ery sorry," interrupted the

"that you are so deoted to your profes

some day I might hae naked you— in

WAYS TO AVERTISE
The Wise Man May Easily See Which
Is the Best Method
It you hae goods to sell, adertise
Hire a man with a lampblack kettle
and a brush to paint your name and
number on all the railroad fences The
cars go whizzing by so fcyst that no
pne can read them, to be" sure, but
perhaps the obliging conductor would
Btop the train to accommodate an in
quisitie passenger
Hae your card in the hotel register
by all means Strangers stopping at
hotels for a night generally buy a cigar
or two before they leae town, and
they need some inspiriting literary food
besides '^
If an adertising agent wants your
business adertised in a fancy frame
at the depot, pay him about 200 per
cent more than, it is worth and let
him put it there When a man has
threequarters of a secoqd in which to
catch a train he inariably stops to
read depot adertisements, and your
card might take his eye
Of course the street thermometer
dodge is excellent When a man's fin
gers and ears are freezing or he Is puff 
ing and "phewlng" at the heat Is the
time aboe all others when he reads
an adertisement
Hae thousands of little dodgers
printed and hire a few boys to;dis
tribute them You'e no idea how the
junk dealer and paper and rag man
will respect you
A boy with a big placard on a pole
is an interesting object on the street
and lends a dignified air to your' estab
lishment Hire about two
Adertise on a calendar People
neer look at a calendar to see what
day of the month it is They merely
glance hurriedly at It so as to be sure
that your name is spelled with or
without a "p," that's all
But don't think of adertising in a
well established, legitimate newspaper
Not for a moment Your adertise
ment would be nicely printed and

the business man, jamming bis pockets

"Can you tell much as to their quali

"Can I? Well, rather For Instance,
there is the wirtlng; there is the spell

way the letter Is folded Eer think
that letters are folded so as to sae

"No," said the adertising man "Its
all I can do to get the stamps to put on

"Easy enough, simple enough, but
folded wrong often enough," said the

takes the sheet and folds It up from the
bottom toward the top, • leaing the

each week saying good morning and
good eening to the men, women, lit
tle children and dogs about me If you
encoiinter the same person twentyfle
times in the same day, you must smile
rapturously, pause, at least shake
hands if you do not kiss, ceremoniously
Inquire how he or she is "going" and
ceremoniously bid him or her "an re
olr" at parting Not only eery man
and woman expects this, but all the
little children toddle up to you^shake
hands and exact the same amount of
ceremony Then eery well regulated
French family has a dog that more
than likely occupies a chair and eats
off a plate beside you at the table, so
that it is considered churlish If you do
not also stop and tell the dog "bon
Jour" and "au reolr" a dozen times a
day, pausing to take the paw which he
is prettily taught to extend to you
When the washerwoman brings home
your linen, there are at least fie min
utes spent In ceremoniously greeting
and parting from her In the operation
of receiing and paying for linen you
exchange "merds" and "pardons" not
fewer than ten tunes Any other ser

A WISE OL FOX
One Who For a LongPersonal Time Clererly
Eluded the Hounds
In common with other people who
hae looked after fox coerts " I hae
often been puzzled by the disappearance
of well known foxes and hae become
coninced that | the more j intelligent
foxes, after they hae  been before
hounds seeral times, often turn their
wits to account to aoid being hunted
In a small coert that I know well
there was always  a fox A fine big
fellow he was I hae more than once

opened he gae us one or two capita!
runs, on the second occasion only Just
saing his brush by scrambling into an
unstopped drain in our neighbor's terri
tory After that he was neer to be
found 'when hounds came | Yet he was
seen about as usual at other times One
day when walking near the coert one
of the terriers, who knew all about
foxes, took a line to an old tree in the
hedgerow and began to whimper and
scratch at the roots A careful exam

not difficult to climb It proed to bare

NOT COMMENABLE
An article appeared in the Cala
eras Prospect two weeks ago, pur
porting to hae been written in
Jackson, and signed "A Working
Miner" The article is against the
candidacy of C E Clinch, a prom
inent resident of Grass Valley, who
is an aspirant for the houor of being
one of the two delegates to which
the first congressional district is en
 titled to in the republican national
conention The writer claims to
hae been a former resident of Grass
Valley, and personally acquainted
with Mr Clinch, who is admitted to
be able, intelligent, and aboe re
proach But he happens to be, so
the writer states, the manager of a
company's stored and this fact is
trotted out as an unsurmountable
barrier to his candidacy To send
a man holding a position of that
"kind would alienate the support of
the miners It would amount to a
recognition of an unfair principle,
and would endangef the republican
success in the coming campaign
,The Ledger does not beliee the
communication was written by a
"working miner" of Jackson An
anonymous communication attack
ing the elegibility of a candidate for
such a place, and published outside
his "home" county, can only be
iewed with distrust, and will hae
little weight with republicans gen
erally We do not know Mr Clinch,
and would not hae known of his
political aspirations had it not been
for this attack from an unknown
source But the strange part about
it is that the article was republished
in full in the Sutter Creek Record,
thereby endorsing the attack, and
making the additional charge that
Clinch is not an aailable man for a
national delegate because he was
formerly a democrat, and is merely
a halfmade republican at the pres
ent time He furthermore supplied
coin to put up a building occupied
by the Grass Valley Union — a dem
ocratic paper But the most sig
nificant part of the Record's article
is the statement in conclusion that
Hon E C Voorheis of Sutter Creek
is also a candidate for delegate from
this district, and ought to be se
lected The Ledger, from moties
of home pride, and from personal
knowledge of the man extending
oer many years, would like to see
Mr Voorheis receie the honor We
cannot beliee that the mention of
his name in a doublebarreled tirade
of abuse of a rial candidate has
been made with his knowledge or
consent Such raw political work,
such petty backbiting tactics, hurt
rather than help the cause they are
intended to sere Knowing Mr
Voorheis as we do, as a lifelong re
publican, and a man of too much
selfrespect to stoop to methods
tainted with unfairness, we sin
cerely hope this illadised and in
temperate work will not be held
against his candidacy by the repub
licans of the first district
ELAYE FREIGHT
The urgent need of improed
means of transportation of freight
to the mining towns has been signally
illustrated the past few weeks by
the conditions preailing at Jack
son, and we presume other towns
along the lode Just now the mer
chants are complaining on account
of the nonreceipt of goodfe, owing
to the impossibility of getting them
hauled from lone At the railroad
depot the congestion of freight is de
plorable We are told that hun
dreds of tons of goods of all classes
hae accumulated at the depot,
awaiting transportation to Jackson
and other towns There are only
four teams hauling general freight
from lone to Jackson — three of Pic
cardo's aud oue belonging to C
ufrene While these may be ade
quate to handle the business during
the summer months, or while the
roads are in fair condition, they are
utterly inadequate at the present
time The road is in such shape
from the continuous rains, that not
more than half a load can be
brought, and it takes three days to
make the round trip — double the
time that is required under normal
conditions The effect of this state
of affairs upon the business interests
of this section may be readily
imagined Some merchants hae
had their goods lying at the depot
for the last two weeks, and there is
no telling when they can be hauled
• Heay freight like sugar, flour, etc,
is delayed because of its weight
One business house has 20 tons lying
at lone Liery stables also find it
difficult to get grain find other pro
isions hauled In fact there is a
general outcry in this respect The
situation is so acute that some busi
ness men are talking of hiring
special teams to briosj up their
goods There is Tittle prospect of
relief until the weather settles, and
the road gets in better condition
In spite of the ast sums of money
spent on the road between here aud
lone, that thoroughfare today is in
a desperately bad condition The
impression is now general that
unless a system is deised to secure
much better results for the money
expended than heretofore, it is im
possible to keep it in anything like
shape The heay traffic will wear
it out faster than the funds aail
able can keep it in repair It is a
hopeless task, as far as permanent
improement goes We hae spent
enough money on this road during
the past ten or twele years to hae
graded and laid the roadbed for a
broadgauge railroad Of course,
while it is the only means of com
munication we hae, we are bound
to do what we can to keep it up
The people all oer the county are
getting thoroughly tired of trying
to fill up such a seemingly bottom
less pit The only relief is a rail
road to take off the heay traffic
that neutralizes all efforts to main
tain it as a passable wagon road
WARNING TO SCHOOL TBUSTEES
School trustees of districts in ad
joining counties are being warned
against a smooth fraud who has an
encyclopedia which he misrepresents
to trustees as haing been adopted
by the county board of education
and as he is a smoothe talker he has
succeeded in dupiug many trustees
into buying As soon as he gets
their warrant he sells it to some mer
chant, being afraid to take it to the
county superintendent for fear his
scheme would beexposed — Mariposa

How is This for Home Interests
The ispatch man isited Stockton
last week He secured two or three
small ads for his paper from business
firms in that city On his return home,
speaking of the alertness of Stockton
for business, he saysPersonal
Seeral of these enterprising men and
firms hae become aware of the fact
that Amador county, possesses quite an
important element of trade, and are
making an effort to secure at least a
portion of it by offering inducements
that we think it would be to the ad
antage of our people to accept
This is certainly an eyeoporier for
the business houses of Jackson, who
are the main support of the local
papers To accept adertising from
the outside is legitimate business Ad
ertising space is a commodity to be
sold to whoeer will buy, just the same
as the merchandise in a store It is
the proince of the local paper, how
eer, in its editorial columns to seek to
build up home trade This policy is
dictated by eery consideration of
loyalty and selfinterest To recom
mend in all seriousness that the people
of Jackson gie their patronage to
Stockton in preferance to home indus
tries, is a sample of going back upon
"our people," which is rarely equalled
in California journalism

A Neglected Opportunity
The opening of the St Louis exposi
tion draws on apace As a county,
Amador has done absolutely nothing
to hae her resources fittingly repre
sented at that great world's fair Un
less a stir is made, and made quickly,
this opportunity will be allowed to go
by default, and such an outcome would
be a reflection upon our enterprise With
out a parallel in California The
superisors hae made no step in this
direction, notwithstanding that the
subject has been repeatedly broached
It is not too late to make a showing
een at this eleenth hour Why not
get a moe on The following letter
addressed to J B Tregloan, who has
manifested much interest in this direc
tion, is published as a matter of public
concernPersonal
' March 12, 190
Mr John B Tregloan 
ear SirPersonal 
Referring to our conersation re •
garding $150 nugget picked up recently
at Volcano in your county, it has oc
curred to me that if thl3 nugget could
be secured, it would make a splendid
item for our California Mining Exhibit,
and one which could be turned to good
account, not only for Amador county,
but for the state at large, as dispelling
the idea that the day of gold nugget
finding in California had passed Im
agine a nugget labeled as found at Vol
cano, Amador county, such and such a
date People would be attracted by it
and the natural expression would be — "1
soe thoy are still picking up gold nug
gets in California"— and the conclusion
would be that Volcano, where it was
found, must be a rich locality
If the nugget is sent to us we will re
ceipt for it, and I hae no doubt what
eer but that it will be returned as
directed, but, of course, with such
specimens there is always a little appre
hension created by the possibility of
doubt as to its safety, and if the owner
considers there is any risk, the county
might ery consistently buy it from
him, and send it to us to be displayed
as indicated I cannot imagine any
thing that the county could do for the
same money that will result in greater
benefit by way of emphasizing its min
eral resources, and fixing the name of
Amador as a mining county on the
minds of thousands of isitors to the
World's Exposition
If this nugget is secured as suggested,
it may be sent to us by express, ad
dressed California State Building,
World's Fair Grounds, St Louis, Mo

ied in the Hospital
I L Godfrey, the wellknown car
penter of Water street, died in the
county hospital on Tuesday last, after
a lingering illness, incident to extreme
old age He was one of the old timers
here, haing worked at his trade in
Jackson in early days He went back
to the eastern states, howeer, and re
mained there a number of years, but
returned to California some twele
years ago, and has remained in Jack
son eer since He was one of the most
expert workers in wood that eer came
to the county Samples of bis handi
work in the making of high class fur
niture are found in Jackson, which
testify to his wonderful skill in that
line He lied alone in his bus'uioss
premises on Water stroot, and worked
at his trade until a few months ago,
when the infirmities of age so pressed
upon him that he was unable to take
care of himself He then stayed at the
Globe hotel for some weeks, but finally
was persuaded to go to the hospital
about two months ago His son, r
F H Godfrey, of Bloomington, Illi
nois, came out to isit him the latter
part of January, and intended to take
him back to Illinois if his health would
permit It was deemed unwise to at
tempt such a trip in tho depth of win
ter, so the son returned to the east,
hoping that he would be able to stand
tbe journey in the spring The doctor
was notified of his death, and sent word
to gie him proper burial here The
funeral took place today, the remains
being interred in the Catholic como
tery, the deceased haing embraced
that faith a few hours prior to his death
eceasod was a natie of Maine, 85 years

honorablo in all his dealings, and was

The fourroomed dwelling house

the Jackson Gate road, on a lot in

stroyed by fire last night The fire
was discoered about 10 o'clock How
it originated is a mystery, but
the circumstances wear a suspicious
look The place was unoccupied; no
stoe has eyer been in thc house siiico
its erection The flames seemed to
shoot up all at once, and this fact is
significant considering the incessant
rains we hae had, and tho consequent
wet condition of the building It is
said that the srnoll of coal oil was
strong A party was seen leaing tho
premises a short time before the fire
was discoered The residence of J,
Coombs is within a few feet of the
premises, and it was all the firefighters
could do to sae it from the flames It
took fire seeral times, but determined
effort saed it The Preitali place was
utterly destroyed Wo hae not heard
that it was insured The loss is esti

it for lumber bought from F M Whit

VOLCANO ITEMS
Miss Bertha Lucot of Jackson, has
been isiting Miss Rosa Tarn during
the week
A large company of young people
gathered at Armory hall St Patrick's
ee, and Indulged in dancing until a
late hour, Music was furnished by the
home orchestra, which gae entire sat
isfaction to all present
The republicans of this place are
talking of starting a Rooseelt club
soon, with either Perkins or Pardee
for second place fJi
 The county papers were full of con
ention talk last week, so we want to
gie timely notice that Volcano will
claim the right to name one of the
seen delegates to which Amador coun
ty is entitled in the state" conention
The eastern portion of the county, has
many enthusiastic republicans, and it
is just possible that any one of them
"might Personal be persuaded to accept tho
honor";
Miss Katie Bund entertained the
New Century Club at the home of her
grandmother, Mrs Benj Ross, Friday
eening The popular games of flinch,
bourse, whist, etc, interspersed with
phonographic selections, occupied the
early part of the eening Fortune
telling by two young gypsy maids, re
cent arriajs from the mother country,
was' 'most amusing and instructie
Grandma Ross then led the company
to the dining room, where iands galore
were spread before them, and after a
long but ain effort to "clear the
boards" the usual goodbys were said,
and the occasion was a thing of the
past
FISHING
Good for the Ledger in taking the
100 trout fishing proposition to task
By saying what you did, you no doubt
oiced the sentiment of 90 per cent of
the people of ' Amador county "God
grae man dominion oer the fishes of
the sea and the fowls of the air" The
word man means all men in this decla
ration, but a few of the nimrods of this
county, styling themseles "Game As
sociation," want to change this diine
proclamation to read "a few men"
Our statutes aro already perloaded
with game and fish laws Some are
good, and many otherwise 75 per
cent of the people of Amador county do
not go fishing once in fie years, and
when a family does go they should be
allowed to pull out all the trout that
are suckers enough to swallow their
hook While on the fitter hand, mem
bers qf Personal 'game associations" gener
ally fish each season, and go in com
panies of from fie to twenty persons
Of coure, if this ordinance was passed
thoy would all continue to fish until
each one of the 20 members had JOQ
trout, or 2000 for th,e day's fishing
Great projection this Wouldn't it be
more businesslike for these game as
sociations to buy a thousandacre tract
of land, stock it with deer, elk, does,
quail, etc, build a large reseroir, fill
it with trout, bass, suckers, etc, hae
certain times when the members could
hunt, and enjoy themseles at their
own, expense, and let the dear good
people of the county hae a chance, to
get a few of the does and fishes they
are always trying to protect, (for them
seles) We beliee the superisors
will legislate for the 90 per cent of their
constituents rather than the game as
sociations
THE GLENN OR WHITMORE MINE
After als days' crushing with the
little stamp mill on this mine, we
were permitted to take into our hands
and examine with our dreamy eyes a
52 oz gold brick that had been ex
tracted from about 75 tons of ore, It
seemed too good to be true, but the
foreman,  Mr Robinson, assured us
that we wore not deceied, and said it
was only a repetition of the 15 days'
run made in February Fie men do
all the work, and it is the intention of
those interested to run the mill to its
fullest capacity until the water supply
gies out This mine shows a largo
ein of pay ore from the summit to the
base of the hill, the rock at both ex
tremities assaying oer $12 per ton
The ein is increasing with depth,
going to show that with proper means
of deelopment we will hae a great
diidend producer right hero in Vol
cano This is only one of many just
such mines in this neighborhood One
fifth of the money spent in any one of
the prospects along the mother lode
would be sufficient to operate a dii
dend producer here Heretofore when
a prospect has been started it has in
ariably been superintended by some
one not familiar with the peculiar ledge
formation found in this locality, and
being unwilling to take adice, theory
preailed instead of experience And as
a result some properties that are
known to be aluable hae been dubbed
"no good" If some  good company
could secure the Glenn mine, equip it
with a good ten or fifteen stamp mill,
let Mr Robinson hae full control as
superintendent, it is safe to say that
within sis mouths those people who
hae been giing us tho black eye so
long would bo compelled to face about,
look wise and exclaim, "I knew it I
hae been expecting this for some time ' '

To Purchase Traction Business
It is reported that the promoters of
the olectric railroad from lone to the
mining belt hae made arrangements
to purchase from  McCall the trac
tion engine outfit used last summer,
together" with wagons and tanks,
horses, mules and harness, used in the
deliery of oil to the arious mines
The object is to secure the contracts
for hauling freight to the mines, which
contracts are now held by McCall, and
which would be turned oer to tho
railroad company in the eent of the
deal being consummated upon tho
completion of the railroad These
freight contracts are an important item
of business for the projected road By
this moe the company secures the
freight business of the mines, taking at
the same time the expensie traction
outfit, which, howeer, can no doubt
be turned to profitable use in some
other direction

MINING NOTES
Gwin— The damage to the mine
caused by letting the skip down the
shaft, resulting in the instant death of
Chas W Leensky, was repaired by
Sunday Anew cable 2700 feet long
was brought up by express, and Sun
day morning the hoisting out of that
compartment was resumed The dam 
age amounted to something like 82700
for the cablo alone, as it is impractic
able to use an old cable after an acci
dent of that kind The skip was also
battered up badly by contact with the
sump It was repaired under the direc
tion of Garbarini Bros, and is still in
serice ' '"?
estructie fire at Preston
Tuesday night a red glare in the west
was isible in Jackson for oer two
hours, and those who noticed it were
of the opinion that it was caused by a
serious conflagration Wednesday it
was learned that one of the buildings
of the Preston School of Reform at
lone had been destroyed by fire during
the preious night The structure
was known as the Trades building
next in size to the main administration
building The fire originated in the
furnace room; how it started we hae
not learned Heroic efforts were made
to stay its march, but in spite of all
that could be done the building was
entirely gutted The loss is estimated
at $30,000 The disaster will badly
cripple the institution for a time, as all
the machinery and tools used in in
structing the boys in the mechanical
arts were contained in this building

»<llinK In Which 'Ladders Toulc
the Place of Stairnays
Years ago a story was told of a naal
officer, who wanted a house built to
please his own taste in "eery detail
He drew the plans himself, placed them
in the hands of a builder and instructed
him to see that they were carried out in
eery detail Then he went to sea for
 year's cruise When he 'returned
home the house had been completed
with the utmost regard for the plans
and specifications left by the officer
He was tnken through the first floor
and expressed the utmost pleasure In
eerything he saw
"Now," he said, "we will go upstairs
nnd see the second floor"
"Come right out this way where we
hae a ladder," replied the builder ;,Personal>
The seafaring man was astonished
He had planned the bouse with the
greatest care, but forgot to proide for
a stairway
The story of the naal officer has
neer had a certificate of genuineness
attached to It, but an actual case in
which a house has been built without
a stairway is on record i Washington
It finally became the home of the late
John Boyle, who was for many years
chief clerk of the nay department and
who died In 185, leaing a large es
tate The house In question stood on
the site now occupied by a brewery be
low the naal obseratory It was a
pretentious old mansion, located In
what was a ery stylish section during
the days of the elder John Boyle, who
came to this country in the early years
of the nineteenth century The record
is not clear as to why the house was
constructed without a staircase, but
there is no doubt about the fact

GLOVES IN EARLY AYS
They Were Often Hade to Represent
the Man Who Wore Them, '
In the early days eerything was not
regulated for the people, as It is now,
by the goernment and the law courts
Europe was still young then, and peo
ple had rough and ready means of deal
ing with one another, of buying and
selling or giing goods and property
and settling disputes A gloe, as it
was ery close indeed to a man's hand,
came In course of time to be looked
upon as taking the place of the hand It
self, and sometimes took the man's
place and was made to represent him
For example, to open a fair it was
necessary then to hae the consent and
protection of the great lord in whose
country it was going to be held Those
who wished to open the fair would
come to the nobleman and petition him
to be present He might be ery busy,
or bored at the idea of haing to go, yet
he would know that it must be opened
or his people would be discontented
So he would say to the leaders of the
peoplePersonal "No, my trusty fellows, I can't
open the fair in person, but I will send
my gloe to do It You all know my
gloe 'Nobody has one like it in the
country It Is the one my lady mother
embroidered for me In colored silks and
slier wire, and It has a deep iolet
fringe You can hang It aboe the en
trance of your fair grounds as a sign
that you are acting with my permis
sion If any one disputes your right or
touches his master's gloe I will attend
to him; that's alll" So the gloe would
trael in state to open the f air— St
Nicholas
Old Time Caring Terms
In an old number of a magazine is
sued more than a century ago we light
ed upon a list of different terms used
at "tableß of elegance" in the days
when Queen Charlotte came as the
bride of the young and handsome king
From this list it would appear that
nothing In the way of game was to be
cared The correct phrase was to
"cut up" a turkey, to "rear" a goose,
to "unlace" a hare or rabbit, to "wing"
a partridge or a quail, to "allay" a
pheasant, to "dismember" a heron, to
"thigh" a woodcock, to "display" a
crane and to "lift" a swan Beef and
mutton were "cared," of course, and
the sporting men prided themseles by
using appropriate sporting terms when
the spoil of their morning's work made
its final appearance on the table—Mod

Our ouble Seles
In a form of experience which is al
most as common as ordinary dreaming
we see that the semisomnolent self
possesses a faculty not always gien

own waking self, for Instance, my half
asleep self is almost a personality of
genius He can create isions that the
Waking self can remember but cannot
originate and cannot trace to any mem

THE" WINTER OF TB6l
(•lilcnt of the Nineteenth Century la
New England
The winter or 1801 was noted for be
ing one of the coldest, and, In fact, It
was the coldest one, in the century
The coldest day of the winter was Fri
day, Feb 25, and Is known as cold
Friday There had been a heay
storm of light, fine snow It cleared
off cold, and the wind blew a perfect
gale, thus making tbe cold more fear
ful The air was filled with snow so
thick one could see only  a rod or two
In any direction Men who were oblig
ed to be on the road perished and were
found frozen as hard as marble statues
A ery few traelers suried the or
denl But few had thermometers In
those days to tell how cold it really
was, but what few there were regis
tered 0 to 50 below zero in Androscog
gln, and in Aroostook county it was
een lower Penobscot bay was frozen
oer so solid that Sam Randall  of
Vanalhaen took a horse and sleigh
and, together with the Hon Martin
Kiff, who was the representatie to the
legislature from Vinalhaen cruised
from Vinalhaen to North Haen, then
to Saddle island, then to Camden and
thence across country to Augusta,
where he left Kiff and returned to Vi
nalhaen again safely Portland harbor
and Boston harbor were frozen oer
solid Thousands of the Boston people
aailed themseles of the fact, and the
ice on the harbor was coered with
skaters — Lewlston Journal  
GRINNING MATCHES
An Accepted Form of Sport In Early
English ays
That grinning matches were an ac
cepted form of sport In early English
days is shown by an adertisement an
nouncing a gold ring to be grinned for
by men on Oct 9 at the Swan, Coleshill
heath, in Warwickshire, which appear
ed in the PostBoy of Sept 11 and 17,
1711, supplemented by the suggestion
that all the country fellows within ten
miles of the Swan should grin an hour
or two hi their glasses eery morning
In order to qualify themseles for this
extraordinary competition • 
Addlson gies a detailed account of
one of these "controersies " of faces,"
telling us that the audience unanimous
ly bestowed the ring on a cobbler, who
"produced seeral new grins of his own
Inention, baring been used to cut
faces for many years together oer his
last" S
His performance was something like
thisPersonal "At the ery first grin he cast e
ery human feature out of his counte
nance; at the second he simulated the
face of a spout, at the third that of n
baboon, at the fourth the head of a
bass iol and at the fifth a pair of nut
crackers" Addison adds that a comely
wench, whom he had wooed in ain for
more than fie years, was so charmed
With his grins that she married him the
following weefc,"the cobbler using the
prize as bis wedding ring
UNER THE ROSE
The Term Which Stands as the Sym
bol of Cloned Lips
Sir T Browne, In his "Inquiries Into
Vulgar Errors," dated IGC, says of the
old phrase sub rosa, "The expression is
commendable, if the rose, from any
natural! propertie may be the symbole
of silence," and goes on to quote some
Latin lines which represent the rose
bud folded in its sheath as an emblem
of closed lips
He also speaks of the secrecy to be
obsered "in society and couipotatioh
from the ancient custome in Syuiposi
acke meetings to wear chaplets of roses
about their heads"
Others derie the expression from the
fable that Cupid gae a rose to Har
pocrates, the god of silence, as a bribe
to preent the disclosure of the amours
of Venus
There are many records of roses
cared upon ceilings in early and In
more modern times as reminders to
guests that words spoken in coniial
moments should not be repeated
It is said that in 1520 roses conse
crated by the pope were placed oer
the confessionals i Rome to denote se
crecy
Face Powder In Cuba
In Cuba there has neer apparently
been any dearth of face powder een
among the lowliest The Cuban wom
an, octogenarian as well as "swwt se
enteen," considers powder a more neces
sary article of tlie toilet than soap and
water and utterly indispensable to her
attractieness, which it is her absolute
duty to presere All classes of the
community are deoted to the powder
puff, from the little sixyearold orphan
in the asylum to the lady of high de
gree In any Cuban school teachers
and pupils are alike unsparingly pow
dered, and a powder box is to be' found
In eery desk and as likely as not keep
Ing company with the chalk used for
the blackboard
The Man In the Moon
Probably een In prehistoric times
men hae noticed the face of the "man
In the moon" Plutarch noticed it and
een wrote a whole book about the face
in the moon But, besides this, many
other objects are supposed to be isible
The dark markings on the surface are
likened by the Chinese to a monkey
pounding rice In India they are said
to resemble a rabbit To the Persians
they seem like the earth's oceans and
continents reflected In a mirror

SETTING IN THE WALNUTS'
Xn Induxtry That Closes California
Conntry Schools
The first English walnut orchard in
California was planted with seed from
;he Los Angeles mission gardens, where
the padres had started a few trees with
nuts brought with them from Spain
The undertaking was a success from
the first, and the acreage of walnuts
has steadily increased The walnut
tree's early age of bearing, its long life
md the steady demand "for its product
tend to make the enterprise deseredly
popular
The walmlt tree begins to bear when
six or seen years old, and nothing Is
known definitely of its age limit of
bearing Fabulous stories are told of
trees in Spain one or two centuries old
bearing enormous crops The oldest
trees in California are still bearing, but
deductions from the short history al
ready made show that the tree Is In its
prime from its twentyfifth to its thir
tieth year Fifteen hundred pounds of
nuts to the acre is a good aerage yield,
naking seenty fie pounds the aerage
weight from one tree
The harest time begins about the
middle of September and lasts nearly
six weeks The nuts begin to fall with
the leaes, and the perfect cultiation
under the trees leaes no chance for
them to lose themseles among clods
or weeds The brown dead, leaes
ilone hide the nuts Under normal con
ditions they drop free from the outer
husk, or hull, through its irregular
bursting, and getting the nuts picked
up is a simple matter Sometimes the
trees are well Irrigated just before har
est time to insure the clean dropping
of the nuts
Boys and girls, men and women, Jap
anese and Chinese, are all pressed into
serice, and on hands and knees the
great orchards are gone oer, not once,
but seeral times, on account of the Ir
regular ripening of the nuts The trees
are occasionally shaken during tbe sea
son to loosen the nuts, and before the
last gleaning they are "poled" to start
the ery tardy ones This is done by
long, coarse bamboo poles, whose light
weight makes them easily handled
In certain rural districts the public
schools close regularly for a "walnut
acation" The help of the children Is
needed, and the children are nothing
loath to replenish their diminished
purses Fails, cans and gunnysacks are
scattered among the pickers, and when
the bags are full they are carried to
the drying grounds, where they are
spread out on slat trays to dry—Re

iscontent With Work
That there is much discontent with
work among the so called middle
classes In America Is due in large part
to the pampering of children, to the
supplying of their natural and artificial
wants and to the sentimental idea that
"their day of toll will come soon
enough" In general, work Is not a
curse, but a blessing— a positie means
of grace One can hardly begin too
early to impress upon children lessons
of self help by tasks appropriate to
their age and forces and to beget in
them scorn of idleness and of depend
ence on others To do this Is to make
them happy through the self respect
that comes with the realization of pow
er and thus to approximate Tennyson's
goal of man, "Self reerence, self
knowledge, self control"— Century
o It Now
The following sentiment has been
ariously attributed to Stephen Grel
let, Sir Rowland Hill, Edward Courte
nay and the Earl of eon, and
la said to hae been Inscribed upon the
tombstone of the latterPersonal "I expect to
pass through this world but once If,
therefore, there be any kindness I can
show or any good thing I can do to any
fellow being, let me do it now Let mo
not defer It nor neglect it, for I shall
not pass this way again"
