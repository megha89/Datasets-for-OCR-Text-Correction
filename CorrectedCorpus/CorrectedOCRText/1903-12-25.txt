HIGH NOON
9rlKlnaUy It Was 8 o'clock In the
Afternoon
The word "noon" is originally de
ried from the Latin nona hora, the
ninth hour of the Romans, the 8 o'clock
of today, but no clew is gien as to
when or why the change took place
which made "noon" mean midday, or
12 o'clock ' \  / ""
 This will be discoered if we go back
to early times, for then great deference
was paid to Saturday afternoon as a
preparation for the {Sabbath, when
work was eased all oer the land In
058 King "Edgar in his ecclesiastical
laws laid it down that "Sabbath shall
be obsered from Saturday 'noon' till
light  appears on Monday morning"
Johnson, commenting upon this, says
"noon" is 3 o'clock, and remained so
till the reformation
  How, then, , came it to mean 12
o'clock? In this wayPersonal Monks, by their
rules' were not  to dine till they had
sung their "nones," or noontide serice
When midday, 12 o'clock, began to be
the time of eating and drinking the
monks, who were also the masters of
language in the dark ages, anticipated
both their deotions and their meals
by singing , "nones"  immediately, after
the 12 o'clock serice Thus the "noon"
of old was mergedinto the Personal "noon"; of
today,' and for a'; time '"distinction was
made 'between the "two by calling 12
o'clock noon and 3 o'clock "high noon,"
as it appears In "The Shepherd's Al
manack"
Animal Barometers
The tortoise is not an animal one
would naturally fix upon as likely to
be afraid of rain, but it is singularly
so Twentyfour hours or more before
rain falls the Galapagos tortoise makes
for some conenient shelter On a
bright clear morning, when not a cloud
is to be seen, the denizens of a tortoise
farm on the African coast may be seen
sometimes heading for the nearest oer
hanging rocks When that happens, the
proprietor knows that rain will come
down during the day, and, as a rule It
comes down in torrents The sign ne
er fails This prcsensatlon, to coin a
word, which exists in many birds and
beasts may be explained partly from
the increasing weight of the atmos
phere'when rain is forming, partly by
habits of liing and partly from ;t!ie
need ofuioisture which is shared by
all The American catbird gies warn
ing » of an approaching  thunderstorm
by sitting on tlae low branches of the
dogwood' tree (whether this" union of

Followed irections
A clergyman  in New Jersey hired a
man to act in the capacity of coachman

bought a bottle of horse liniment N and
told the man to apply It to a lame horse
according to the directions on the bot

About an hour afterward he went to
the barn and found Silas industriously
dipping a spike into the liniment and
then rubbing it against the horse's leg
"What are you doing that for?" he
asked 
The man looked up with a smile of
assurance "Because,", said he, " 'twas
what It said in the directions on the
oottle, but it's slow work"

A GLIMPSE OF TOKYO
SCENES IN THE SCARRE CAPITAL
OF EASTERN JAPAN*
A Widespread Medley of Unpleasant
SlKhts, Odors and Sounds— Some of
the In'cunTenienccs That Beset tile
Foreigner In Shopping
Tokyo, the ast sprawling capital of
oastem Japan, a comparatiely young
city Is aged with the scars of fire, of
earthquake and of war • This great
city, once of 1,000,000 Inhabitants,
spread oer what is popularly estimat
ed as a hundred square miles, seems
still to cower in the shadow of the for
tress of the great Iyeyasu
For the American tourist unprepared
for the real orient and knowing Japan
only through her art products and the
few pen pictures of the artist rhapso
dlsts who hae embarrassed her with
their praises Tokyo is a rare purgatie
Except for the stately and  dignifled
tombs of the shoguns and the fine offi
cial grounds and buildings of the capi
tal he finds his senses assailed on eery
side by unpleasant sights, odors and
sounds
Approaching Tokyo by train from Yo
kohama, he sees the green hillsides pla
carded with enormous adertisements
Arried in the city, he finds the poster
and billboard eerywhere monstrous
and flagrant Stagnant sewers He along
the roadside, and foul odors arise from
>the paements, constantly wet down
by the householders Porters and store
keepers with a rag of a breechclout or
a scant skirt Jostle, shout and stare,
and perhaps a whole family may be
seen In a doorway ready for the tub,
from which you see the steam arising
I A street called the Ginga is the state
street of Tokyo, and here In the een
Ing you may find an Infinity of Wares
spread out upon the walk, which is one
of the few real sidewalks In Japan
Most of these wares, howeer, are a
ast Inconsequential array of cheap
trifles, such as the enterprising mana
ger of an American "fie cent store"
might gather together There are, how
eer, ; a ' number of somewhat preten
tious stores to "be seen by the persist
ent shopper   
Shopping in Tokyo, howeer, Is at
tended by many inconeniences To be
gin with, your rickshaw man knows no
English and nothing about the stores,
and the names and numbers of streets
are known only to the map makers
Where a street has a name It Is likely
to belong only to the shady side and to
run around the block Instead of contin
uing  from the next corner   If , how
eer, Personal you succeed In finding a store
your troubles hae Just begun The
proprietor sits at the rear of the estab
lishment, cross legged, before a small
desk By irtue of being in his own
store he has reached the summit of
earthly desire and cares nothing about
you Perhaps If you wait some small
'clerk of a dozen years or less will come
to wait upon you and, seeing you are
a foreigner, will charge you extra for
the few words of English he can mas
ter 
If you are bold enough to leae your
xtckshaw and wander about on foot you
will soon attract a curious crowd, the
clatter of whose wooden geta upon the
flags will well nigh deafen you It is a
good natured, well meaning crowd,
howeer, and will soon be scattered by
a policeman If there are any clerks
going your way' they will address you
in the hope of learning a few words of
English or initing you to their stores
There is no hostility or insult, only cu
riosity and good natured, childish
amusement
Modesty Is an unknown quantity in
Japan, as one soon learns If your rick
shaw man's two garments become damp
he Is likely to change them before you,
and fellow traelers in the cars are
sure to change their clothes without
deference to place or surroundings
Men and women use the same tank at
the same time in the public baths with
out a thought of impropriety
The streets of a Japanese city are full
of Interesting sights and seem neer
twice the same Eery store and eery
passer by Is a noelty that chains tho
attention for a moment In a land
where nearly all wares are hand mndc
eery article has some Indiiduality,
and one Is led on with the hope of find
ing something better than the rest
Heay loads are carried through the
streets on the backs of men and wom
en, on horses and on two wheeled carts
The carts are drawn by bulls or shag
gynorthern stallions and are guided by
the drier, who walks with the pole
The burdens carried by women ' anrt
children are remarkable All oer Ja
pan the heaiest work is done by worn
en, the bricks and masonry for the new
museum and goernment buildings be
ing so transported in the heat of mid
Bummer Children carry their brothers
and sisters strapped to their backs and
haul great loads on heay carts The
life of the laboring classes seems ery
arduous, and they are remarkably pa
tient and Industrious Throughout city
and country eery one seems to be hard
at work
T,he death rate of Tokyo is ery high
The custom of carrying ery young
children strapped on the back with
their heads unprotected from the sun
leads to thousands of cases of brain fe
er and blindness A majority of the
children bear the marks of skin dis
eases, and their heads are often nau
seating to behold The water used In
the city is suspicious, and traelers

* ANCE IN THE KLONIKE
fuii atn Miller's Story and the Way
He Clinched It
At one of his lectures Just after his
return from the Klondike Joaquln Mil
ler told the following storyPersonal "One night
I was inited to a dance In a miner's
cabin, and while Bill alton scraped
away en j his Personal  fiddle we Just hoed it
down But the miners tramped in and
out so much between dances that be
fore midnight the ladies declared the
floor was so slippery they couldn't
dance another step unless something
was done 'Then something was done
that neer was possible in mining
days ;iii "California  Each miner 'gal
lantly ''opened his buckskin powder
pouch and sprinkled gold dust on the
floor I And this' was repeated through
out the_, night And in the morning,
ladies • find  gentlemen, those miners
neer troubled themseles about sweep
ing up thflt gold dust They Just hitch
ed up_ttf?it dog sleds and rode away"
rAt • thitf • point of Miller's narratie
there was a slight agitation In the au
dience, an ominous sign of incredulity,
but Miller was equal to it With a
wae of his hand toward one of the
boxes, he said, "And my old friend up
there in the box, Captain John Healy,
will substantiate what I say"
 It was a master stroke of the poet,
for the house burst into applause and
greatly embarrassed the modest mil
lionaire mining and railroad promoter
of Alaska, who unsuspectingly had ac
cepted Miller's initation to attend the
lecture in the afternoon
Parnell's Superstitions
Charles Stewart Parnell was one of
the strongest men that eer lied, but
he had numberless superstitions Once
a colleague of his brought him the
draft of a bill to the cell he was then
occupying in Kllmainham It was in
thirteen clauses Parnell was horrified
He insisted that somehow or other a
fourteenth clause should be added
Once Parnell saw a colleague with
three lights In his bedroom He was
quite uneasy until he saw one of the
lights put out I traeled with him
once when he had a scarf that had
been presented to him by a lady ad
mirer There was some green in the
scarf  One of his superstitions was
that green was an unlucky color He
used to say, half Joke, whole earnest,
that all the misfortunes of Ireland
came from the fact that her color was
green He was ery much put out by
this scarf It was in the days when
the habeas corpus was suspended in
Ireland and we were sleeping on the
mail boat at Kingstown and were not
to start for'Holyhead till next morn
ing He was quite sure the green scarf
would hae us arrested before we left
in the morning— M A P
Beauties of Red Tape
"A typical Instance of the war ofilce
methods is furnished by a correspond
ent on one of our stations | An officer
haing occasion for the use of a screw
drier made application for the supply
of that humble but handy implement
from the goernment stores His appli
cation was bandied about in the usual
manner from officer to officer and final
ly reached the upper authority, from
whom a reply filtered back by the same
deious ways to the effect that screw
driers were only supplied in tool
boxes and not singly Nothing daunt
ed, the officer at once applied for a
box of tools and after the usual cir
cumlocutory tactics was informed that
boxes of tools were only supplied
to carpenters' shops By this time the
officer, who had quite forgotten what
he had wanted the screwdrier for,
had thoroughly entered into the spirit
of the campaign, and his next applica
tion was for a carpenter's shop He
got it— London TitBits
MacMahon and Grey
In Paris in the reolution of 1830 a
law student was soundly kicked by one
of the king's officers for tearing down
a copy of the ordinances placarded on
the wall The officer was armed, the
student was not; so the latter ran
away Nearly a half century later, in
1870, the officer called upon the stu
dentto bid him goodby, haing Just
resigned the presidency of the French
republic on account of a radical differ
ence with the majority of the national
assembly on questions of state policy
He combined with his adieus also a
graceful word of congratulation on
the student's election to succeed him In
the presidential chair ; The student
was Jules Grey; the officer was Pa
trice de MacMahon, who died ripe in
years and honors
Where They Bat Tobacco
Perhaps there Is nothing more pecul
iar about the Eskimos of Point Bar
row than their methods of using tobac
co, which, of course, they procure from
the whites They know good from bad
tobacco When they get hold of a few
plugs, they show a marked apprecia
tion of It The babit of chewing the
weed seems to be uniersal Men, wo
men and een unweaned children keep
a quid, often of enormous ulze, con
stantly in the mouth The juice is not
spit out, but swallowed, with the salia
without producing any symptoms of
nausea
Sell Control
"There's one thing I will say," re
marked Mrs Cumrox, "and that is
that my daughter Arabella has a fine
disposition"
"Indeed?""
"Yes, sir The way she can sit for
hours listening to herself play on the
piano shows remarkable self control" —

A WHISTCEFV STORY
the Climax of a inner In Honor cf
the Eccentric Artiot
At the close of the case of Whistler
against Ruskin,  the former, liiiiiinn
himself ery much in need of rest and
recreation, decided to make a southern
trip When he arried in Venice his
American friend thought to cheer him
by giing a littte dinner In his honor
to which were bidden seeral friemls
of the artist, principally American*
and some few Italians uring tup
meal there arose a discussion which
left an opening for Mr Whistler to
use upon his  host one of those keen,
incisie, erbal thrusts peculiar to him,
which left wounds extremely difficult
to heal The whole company wag
startled, but the host merely smiled,
seeming to notice only the brilliancy of
the attack Presently, howeer,  the
dinner came to an gnd and the foreign
guests took their leae Then the host
turned upon Mr Whistler and, in a
oice trembling with suppressed anger,
saidPersonal
' "Jimiuie, do you know that you bru
tally insulted me tonight?" 7 '
"Yes," replied the artist thoughtfully
"Well," continued the host, "I held
my temper while there were others
than our own countrymen present, but
do you know what I shall do if eer
you speak to me like that again?"
"What?"
"I'll grab the nearest water bottle
and smash it oer your head"
The rest of the company sat qnite
still, horror and dismay in their hearts,
while their angry host glared across
the table at his antagonist After a
few seconds Mr Whistler said In a tone
of childlike innocencePersonal
"Then I know what I'll do I'll neer
say anything like that to you again"—

Byron's Fatted Goose
One of the  stories ! concerning the
traditional dish of roast goose on Mi
chaelmas day refers to Lord Byron,
says an English newspaper The poet
always insisted in keeping up old cus

hot cross buns on Good Friday and
roast goose on Michaelmas day This
last fancy had a grotesque result when
he was in Italy After buying a goose
and fearing it might be too lean Byron
fed it eery day for a month preious

the bird became so mutally attached
that when Sept 20 arried he could
not kill it, but bought another and had

Music the Kernel of Welsh Nature
Music is the ery soul and kernel of
the Welsh nature A musical ear is the
national birthright  Eery Welsh
preacher who migrates to an English
church finds the greatest difficulty In
abstaining from that weird, peculiar
intonation of his sermon which is
known as the hwyl and which is often
strange and objectionable to English
ears I i'\ 
A remarkable and subtle fact which
will be interesting to English readers
and at the same time significant of the
sensitieness of the Welsh musical ear
Is that it is positie discord to many
among the Welsh congregations if the
minister, In 'giing out' the first erse
of the hymn, does not so pitch his oice
that It shall be in harmony with the
key in which the tune has prelimina
rily been played by the instrumentalist

perado came into & saloon, and of
course those who knew him had busi

tenderfoot remained, and the bad man
inited him to drink The Britisher
innocently said he did not care to do
so, a dangerous remark to make In
those days, whereupon the desperado
wearily reached for hls  gun and said
in a tired sort of way, "Can't I eer
hae a drink without killing a man?"

AN UNPARALLELE CASE
\ ISTow that  the thoroughly] ader
tised deer meat case against the
editor of the Ledger has passed into
history, we feel it a duty incumbent
upon us to comment freely upon this
utterly indefensible attempt at pros
ecution There are features about
its inside history which we do not
propose to discuss, the circumstan
ces not being ripe at present Here
after we hope to be in a position to
bring these to the foreground, re
ealing in all its nakedness the true
inwardness of this effort at criminal
prosecution Tn the course of nearly
thirty years experience in journal
ism in Amador county, there hae
been four different attempts to affix
the stigma of crirjeupon the present
editor of the Ledger They were all
prompted ly uhe same moties and
aimed to accomplish the same end —
namely, to break down or curb the
independent spirit which has char
acterized this paper, by calling into
requisition the machinery of the
courts to that end The nature of
these seeral prosecutions need only
be recalled at this time, and the
ending of each, as so many testi
monials to the uneering course of
the Ledger in the path of duty
First, we were cited to show cause
why we should not be punished for
contempt of court for the publica
tion of an article concerning a case
 which had passed the jurisdiction of
the county court We were ad
judged guilty, and fined $200 with 8
hours imprisonment We appealed
to the supreme court on habeas
corpus, and by that tribunal not
only discharge^, but also indicated
in the publication of the article
Next we were yanked into the jus
tice court for publishing a lottery
adertisement — the same adertise
ment that had been running for
years in the Ledger before we as
sumed control, and without any prior
protest from the authorities The
spirit of this prosecution pressed
to its ultimate issue — would hae
punished any seller of a raffle
ticket in the county This law had
neer before, and has neer since,
been appealed to Howeer, it was a
law, and we were made a ictim
The jury reluctantly brought in a
erdict of guilty We were fined
the costs, without the alternatie of
imprisonment The animus of this
was apparent— to shut out an ap
peal by habeas corpus We appeal
ed to the superior court, at that time
only recently instituted At that
time we had but one piece of real
estate in the county, the office in
which the Ledger was published
This was attached, and pending the
determination of the appeal, was ad
ertised for sale by the constable to
satisfy the judgment and costs,
which finally ran up into formidable
figures The saleday, howeer,
neer came, as the judgment was set
aside by the appellate court
The next was a libel suit This
was tried twice in San Andreas, to
which court the case was transferred
on a motion for change of enue
The second trial resulted in a er
dict of acquittal
Twenty years hae rolled away
since these eents disfigured the
records of Arcador county They
were all born in the foul a^r of per
sonal or political spite, or the equally
pernicious desire to abridge the lib
erty of the press To the majority
of those now liing, these things
hae faded from iew in the mist of
passing years In the now defunct
deer meat case the same spirit has
cropped up in a more objectionable
and shameless form than it eer be
fore assumed In eery community
will be found more or less of political
and personal intrigue Indiiduals
will go to greater lengths to gratify
their personal pique or disappointed
ambition, than to ent their good
will Eerywhere such forces will
be found at work It is not the
pleasing side of human nature, but
the fact is indisputable Indiiduals
may make an exhibition of themsel
es in this direction, but it is inar
iably the case that the great heart
of the people— the public conscience
beats ture to the cause of right It
is stronger than the plotters of eil,
and presents a bulwark against their
mischieous doings, against which
they dash themseles in ain
Let us look calmly for a moment
at this wonderfully deer meet prose
cution Let us suppose that the
facts constituting the so called crime
were undenied; that the editor had
actually partaken of a piece of
enison in the closed season What
of it? Who was wronged by such
action? id it interfere with the
rights of anyone else? id it differ
from satisfying the appetite with
a dish of beef or mutton? It was
lawful to kill the deer, it was unlaw
ful to use the meat Such was the
contention of this amazing prosecu
tion We deny the legal proposition
Fortunately for the other side, the
case died in the inferior court
Neer in the judicial annals of this
or any other state was the eating of
a meal made the basis of a criminal
complaint The blue laws of Con
necticut were not "in it" beside this
new departure in criminal jurispru
deuce The records of the dark
ages — the days of inquisition and re
ligious intolerance— may be searched
in ain for anything to equal it
How any man in possession of his
mental faculties could dream of tak
ing such a course is beyond ordinary
comprehension And yet at is a
fact — and the most deplorable fact
connected with this affair— that an
organization known as the local
game club debated the proposition ;
held two meetings to cousider it It
is only right to ' say that the ast
majority reolted at the suggestion
of prosecution on these lines 'A
representatie of a state commis
sion, an appointee of the board of
superisors, au official of the game
club, with the legal adiser of the
county were arrayed in pressing
this suit, committing as far as  they
were able the state, couuty, and
priate organizations' in this sub
lime effort to uphold the peace and
dignity of the people of the state of
California What a satire upon law
and order What a reflection { upon
an intelligent public  What sort of
an argument is this, for the up
building of California in general, and
Amador in particular, by the filling
up of her waste places by industri
ous^lawabiding homeseekers We
are pleased to say that both state
and county were misrepresented by
this insane moement, and in no
part of California is it more uni
ersallyJenounced than throughout
the lenglh and breadth of Amador
county
PATENT YOUR MINING CLAIMS
It is surprising that so many mine
owners, along or in the immediate
icinity of the mother lode, continue
to hold their claims by a possessory
right title  Year after year they
are subject to the law requiring $100
worth of work to be done on each
claim, under penalty of forfeiture
This week the danger of this tenure
has been brought into strong relief
by a suit oer a mining claim near
Plymouth, where in face of the fact
of the proof of labor being recorded,
as the law requires, the claim was
jumped, and the alue of the assess
ment work done is attacked As a
rule, the annual assessment work of
$100 counts for ery little in the way
of practical deelopment of a mine
Where a miniug claim is allowed to
remain idle for ten or twele months
in the year, the' damage by falling
debris in a tunnel,  or caes i a
shaft, will often amount to $100 So
that the yearly work represents lit
tle more than the restoration of the
property / to the same condition in
which it was left the preceding year
Little or no real adance is made
toward the deelopment of the prop
erty, but the owner pays out his
money or does the work faithfully
enough It is mostly labor in ain;
an expenditure of muscle and means
for nothing For the cost of two or
three years' assessment work, a pat
ent might be obtained We should
think the folly of holding mining
property in this manner would be
recognized by eery owner, and that
a determined effort would be made
to get out of this unsatisfactory rut
True, the owner may be without the
means to pay for getting a patent
And some ready money is absolutely
necessary to make a  moe in that
direction Still, this in many cases
should not present a formidable  ob
stacle Where a claim has any
prospectie merit,, it is generally
practicable to find some one to ad
ance the money needed, for an in
terest in the property This plan of
taking in a partner may hae its ob
jectionable features, but it is in
finitely preferable to the eer lasting
obligation of the annual assessment
work Besides this, when a patent
is secured, the prospect of a N sale is
ery much improed The title is
then secure, and inestors are not
called upon to look into eery little
matter pertaining to the title from
the original location A claim that
is worth holding is worth patenting
The practice of performing assess
ment work year after year, for ten
or twenty years, should be aband
oned for the businesslike proposi
tion of applying for a patent
The spoliation of Columbia is tiot
a matter to be proud of Its dis
memberment by the secession of the
state of Panama, under the shelter
ing wing of the United States, may
be accepted as an accomplished fact
The parent nation may make a bluff
at war, but the reconquest of the
isthmus is out of the question
Singlehanded Panama could not
maintain its independence, but with
the strong backing of the United
States Columbia must submit to the
loss of this territory, That this
state of affairs should be brought
about by the nation pledged for a
generation • to the maintenance of
the integrity of the United States of
Columbia, is not a ; commendable
situation to be placed in The inti
mation of the European powers that
Columbia need not look for any sup
port from that source if she under
takes to recoer by military force
the Panama isthmus, is not an in
dorsement of the infant republic
It simply means that the squabble is
not a cause for interference No
doubt a stable goernment is some
thing to be desired on the isthmus —
destined to see the construction of a
waterway to connect the eastern
and western oceans Under the pro
tecting arm of the United States
stability will be assured From a
commercial standpoint this is all
important' The Panama incident
in its moral phase, is not one that
the future historian will point to
with pride; albeit, howeer, it is
probably one that will greatly re
dound to the benefit of the ciilized
world 5

WHAT THE PAPERS SAY
About that Flagrant Violation of a
Wonderfully Wise Law
Richard Webb, editor of the Ama
dor Ledger, wriS" was arrested for ha
ing enison in his possession" after the
close season for killing deer, was ac
quitted in the justice court in Jackson
last Monday It appears that a friend
of Mr Webb killed a deer just before
the closo season and presented the edi
tor with a piece of the meat He ac
knowledged the* receipt of it in his
paper and his arrost followed To a
man up a tree it looks ory much as if
other moties, rather than, simply a
desire to enforce the game laws, must
Lae prompted the arrest— Calaeras
Richard Webb, editor of the Jackson
Ledger, was acquittod' in ; the justice
court of Jackson last Monday of an
unjust charge of iolating, thewonder
ful and jackassiQed game  laws of the
state of California— haing enison in
his possession out of season The deer
was killed the day before the close of
the season, and some of tho meat was
presented to the editor by tho hunter
The "damphool" game law makes it a
misdemeanor to hae in one's posses
sion deer meat out of season, no mutter
when the animal was killed, or in what
state it was killed/ Great law ' that—
see herePersonal kill a deer on' the last day ' of
the deer season; you can't eat it before
midnight, and youcan't leae it where
it fell on account of your inability to eat
it — that would be wanton | destruction
and prosecution would follow Take it
to your house and food to your hungry
children and then you'd get it again for
haing enison in your possession "out
of season" Mr' Webb was rightly
acquitted, and fclso _ Mr Jones, who
killed the deer— Ca'aeras Citizen
Some time ago Richard Webb, edi
tor of the Amador Ledger, published in
his paper an acknowledgement of tho
receipt of some enison from 'A Jones,
who resides near Ham's Station As
the enison was receied in Noember,
shortly  after the  expiration of the
game season, there has arisen consider
able trouble oer , the affair It is
claimed that the deer was' killed in
October,' but as tho possession of eni
son out of season is a • iolation of the
law, both Jones and Webb find them
seles in trouble There seems to be
quite a number of/ people in Amador
who hae it in for the editor of the
Ledger, who wields an independent
pen, and eidently through some of
these the state officers hao taken the
matter up The two men hao been
arrested, and last Monday was tho day
set for trial We hae not yet learned

An Unjust Law
rr»
A few days ago a young man named
Lefanti, of Jackson, shot and killed a
meadow lark He was arrested and
fined $5 for iolating the game law
This special law is one of the most
assinine eer placed on the statue book
The meadow lark is one of the most
destructie of birds, and there is not a
rancher but would be pleased to hae
a bounty placed on its scalp instead of
paying a penally for its destruction —
lone Echo
We concur A (lock of meadow larks
will go through a crop of grain when
just sprouting aboe the ground, and
utterly destroy it in a short time, pull
ing the grain up by the roots A
farmer near Jackson, hearing of this
fine, reported that his grain crop was
being ruined by these destructie birds
He proposed to apply to the authorities
for permission to shoot them to protect
his property He was mot with the ob
jection that it was not in the power of
the local authorities to suspend or
nullify a state law in the interest of
anyone Eidently such a law emanated
from city legislators, who take their
cue from the bird's singing qualities,
but hae neer witnessed its work on a
field of growing grain

Suit to Quiet Title
The case of William Scoble s T J
Seaey and F A Orr, occupied three
days in the superior court last week,
commencing Thursday and continuing
until Saturday The suit was insti
tuted to quiet title to a certain  quartz
claim in Plymouth district, known as
the Champion mine, which Scoble has
held for a number of years In 1901 F
A Orr relocated the claim, on the
ground of nonperformance of assess
ment work for tha year 1900 Scopje
had filed his proof of labor, alleging

Placer Mining at Volcano—
Seeral placer mines in the icinity of
VQlcano are ready to start, but are
waiting until the debris commissioners
approe of the restraining dams The
law is found to he a great hardship to
the owners of small placer mines, such
as are found in this county All are
required before starting to secure a
permit from the commissioners As
the brush dams become filled up, it is
incumbent upon them to build them
higher Whener this is done, tho
work must bo inspected by a commis
sioner and approed by him before
mining can be resumed This requires
time, and it happens that the best of
the working season  passes by In idle

The eer Cases ismissed
Realizing the futility of attempting a
second trial of the now celebrated deer
cases against R Webb, editor of the
Ledger, and A Jones, the district a^,
torney moed last Monday in Justice
Goldnor's »;ourt that the same bo dis
missed, and both  were accordingly
wiped from the docket The case
against Jones was neer tried at all
There was neer shown any disposition
to try it The animus of the whole af
fair was directed against the editor, for
simply making complimentary men
tion in his paper of the receipt of
a parcel of enison at the Ledger This
act was magnified into mortal crime,
worthy of heay fine and imprisonment,
in accordance with an idiotic law passed
by the last legislature prohibiting ha
ing deer meat in one's possession in
tho closed season Neither the Ledger
nor the donor of the deer meat knew
of the existence of such a law at the
time, and we enture jto say not one in
ten of the members of the local 'game
club knew It either Ignorance is no
excuse for a iolation of the law All
persons are charged with a knowledge
of the law This is all ery well as a
rule, but do man can be charged with
knowledge of a law that is absolutely
absurd And when such a law is sought
to be enforced in a manner that would
hae no tendency whateer to promote
the object which the lawmakers had
in iew by its passage — as was tho case
against the editor of the Ledger— the
only conclusion that can be reached is
that those behind the moement were
beside themseles with malice  To
some it may seem strange that the Led
ger inserted the four or  fie lino item
that caused all this furore' The expla
nation Is easy, and those who  play
strict and loose with the game laws at
one and the same time might hae had
the explanation for the asking Last
year Mr Jones left a piece of enison
at the Ledger office, at the same time
requesting that no mention be made of
It This year on leaing the meat, he
made no request that It be not mention
ed  Hence the inference of the editor,'
that he had no objection to a compli
mentary notice, which was gien
That is all there was to this "tempest
in a teapot" We sincerely pity the
misguided indiiduals who allowed
themseles to be led into sucb a moe
ment Public sentiment— that sensitie
Index of the national character which
neer fails to come to the front in |an
emergency— frowned upon it from the
outset "Shameful,"; "outrageous,"
"contemptible, " were among the
epithets applied to the scheme through
out the county As any sensible man
mlgtft hae foreseen, the affair  has
proen a boomerang It has exploded
In the camp of the plotters The
chagrin, the soreness, and  cheapjohn
feeling are all on that side of the issue
From one end of the state to the other
this amazing legal farce Is being be
littled and ridiculed

IRELAN'S ANIMALS
i&ecieß of Frugi and Toads Ax*
Found In the Green Inle
It Is not correct to say that there are
do frogs or toads In Ireland, though it
ltt ery remarkable that the common
toad is not found there The natterjack
toad is a natie of Kerry, though it
does not appear to be found elsewhere
It Is an example of the mania which
some people hae for meddling with
nature that a r Gulthers in 1699 took
the trouble to procure frogs' spawn
from England, since which time they
hae multiplied In Ireland But the
common lizard Is found In many parts
of the Island The slowworm Is not
Though the common toad and till re
cent times the frog were not found in '
Ireland, It is worth remembering that
the English reptiles  and batrachlans
arc' ery local In their distribution The
natterjack toad is only found In certain
counties The edible frog was formerly
only found in Foulmire Fen, in Cam
bridgeshire, and the sand lizard Is most
capricious in the choice of a home The
"beautiful green lacertse" which Gil
bert White saw on the sunny  banks
near Farnbam are to be found there
still, the males being of the green color,'
and also near Bournemouth and iln
orsetshire beyond Poole Harbor Yet
there are many suitable places where
none are seen, and then they reappear
again on some sandhills on the coast of
Lancashire, near Southport
On the other 'band, the absence of
many species In Ireland which are or
were commonly found in the larger Is
land can only be explained on the sup
position that they neer reached the
country Among these are the wildcat,
the polecat and the weasel Yet the
marten was always plentiful on the
other side of St George's channel, and
stoats abound In tbe west, i Fie of the
fourteen species of bat found in Eng
land hae not been taken In Ireland,
neither is ' the common shrew found
there or the water shrew or the mole,
though the last Is found in Anglesey
Only six of the fifteen British rodents
are found In Ireland, and of these one,
the squirrel, was probably Introduced
Neither is the roe deer indigenous In
support of the general theory that the
immigration of the English fauna was
difficult in the earlier periods and sub
sequently checked altogether may be
cited the analogous instance of the Isle
of Han There, as In Ireland, there are
no moles, no snakes and no toads—

TIME TO HEGE
Bookmaker Wouldn't Lend Money,
' but Gae Good Adice
Seeral turfmen were discussing the
sharp methods of a certain bookmaker
who adds to his income by money lend
ing' He was ' conceded to be a bard
man to deal with
"But I'll bet $500 that I can borrow
$1,000  from him on my personal re
cognizance," said one ,
"one!" answered the otowd simul
taneously, and as he could only stake
one bet they pooled against him'
Thinking he had a sure thing, he went
off with an accompanying committee
to see the money lender    ' 
"Mr Cash" (that wasn't his name), he
said, ' "these gentlemen j hae bet me
$500 that I cannot borrow $1,000 from
you I don't need the money, but you
let me hae It for a day, and I'll di
ide the bet with you/ 
The committee gasped, but the effect
of the cool proposition was unlooked
for Instead of jumping at tbe chance
Mr Cash buttonholed his interlocutor
and saidPersonal
"id you make that bet?"
"I did"
"You bet $500 that you could borrow
money from me?"
"That's what I did"
"Then," In a whisper, "go and hedge"

Whore There's a 'Will There's a Way
"One of those things which go to
show that where there Is a will there
Is a way is well exemplified by a
happening in a certain' southern city,"
said a well • known former railroad
man "A man before his marriage had
purchased a beautifully located lot l
the city cemeteryand paid $100 for>lt
After awhile he married and some ten
or twele years  afterward died and
was buried in the aforesaid beautifully
located lot, and his grae was care
fully tended for awhile by his widow
When the big fair came oft in Chicago
and all the world was en route to that
Mecca the widow took a notion she
must see that show As a result of a
long cogitation oer ways and means
she had the body of her deceased hus
band exhumed and g railroaded fifty
miles away and reburied at a cost of
about $75, when she sold the ceme
tery lot for $600 and had a good old
time at the big world's fair Some
what of a,financier, wasn't she?"—

In Russia, where the cold in winter Is
ery Intense, the markets are ery curi
ous things The meat Is frozen, the car
casses of dead animals, as sheep and
pigs, stand upright outside the stalls;
eerything,' een game and poultry, re
quires to be thawed before It can be
cooked, and the market people's dress
is as , picturesque jas It is warm and
comfortable
The* the riers are frozen oer all
the winter long, and so thick is the Ice
that eery one can skate anywhere and
any time' Stalls are put up on the Ice
and busy markets held there
In the Asiatic part of Russia the peo
pie lie chiefly by hunting and fishing,
and tbe fur of the Russian animals Is
ery beautiful— the ermine, fox, sable,
sea otter and others '  \
At the end of the winter, when the
snow melts, the huntsman pursues the
elk, wearing long shoes, In which he
can glide oer the snow ery quickly,
while the poor elk sinks Into the snow
deeper and deeper eery step and Is at
last oertaken and killed
Hla Two Purchaaen
A Btory Is told of a Louisiana mer
chant who came to New York deter
mined to secure a bargain He wanted
cheap cloaks, and after trying In ain
to suit himself at the wholesale houses
he bought a Job lot at auction" He ex
amined  the goods hurriedly and had
them shipped home ' In due time he
was confronted by an excited head
salesman who said the garments were
out of style \
"They didn't look that way," said the
merchant
"But they are," replied the clerk
The merchant persisted that the
cloaks would sell, but they didn't' In
•desperation he returned them to New
York to be disposed of to best adan
tage On his next trip to New York he
again isited an auction house and
bought a lot of cloaks When he re
turned home and examined his pur
chase he saw that he had bought the
same lot as before— World's Work 
The Bird Monopolist
As Is generally known; the cuckoo
lays its eggs in the nests of other birds,
leaing them to be hatched and tho
young cuckoos reared by, their foster
parents The young cuckoo throws the
other birds out of the nest and gets nil
the care itself After murdering its
foster brothers and sisters in the most
deliberate and callous way it is thence
forth tended with the greatest deo
tion Long after it has left the nest
the great bird, apparently big enough
to get its own liing and many times
larger than its foster parents, is fol
lowed about and fed by them with the
same care as when in the nest
Oak Wood

MARINE ART
Virtues aad ; efects of the Ships
That Sailors Faint
It is an axiom with sailors that there
neer was a man' who put In three
years before the mast who did not
think he could paint a ship bettor than
the most skillful landlubber that eer
wielded a brush In the homes of re
tired \ sea captains specimens of this
kind of marine art are often displayed
on the walls to admiring friends and
are handed down as family heirlooms
A good place for the man who has no
seagoing ' relaties or friends to see
such pictures is in some of the win
dows of Bhip supply stores, on South
Btreet in New York Sailors buy them
occasionally  '^s
Ships that sailors paint are absolutely"
correct in eery detail From a brig to
a full rigged three master there is not a
block or tackle missing from stem to
stern or from masthead to water line
No marine painter could get In half so
much detail if he tried But the ships
painted by sailors look as if they were
caught fast in frost tipped waes
There is absolutely no life or any sug
gestion of motion about them een
when represented as going under full
sail When a sailor tfies to get in a bit
of landscape as a background, as he
usually does, be makes matters hope
lessly worse As a general thing it is a
lighthouse or "a fort looking for all the
world like little images that children
take out of their toy arks— New York

I r Sundberg, former consul to Bag

enture that befell him in a Moham

wies of a rich merchant fell sick, and
r Sundberg was called In to prescribe
for her With a pardonable scientific
Interest the western physician waUgl
Enter a black gunnysack ' It is the pa
tient The doctor would like to feel her
pulse A white band is slipped through
an opening Good And  her  tongue
Impossible! No man sae her husband
may see the face of a woman and lie
or,  nfore accurately, no woman may
uneil her face to any man sae her
husband and lie His professional In
terest aforesaid deeply aroused, the dip
lomatic doctor insists The difficulty Is
at length soled by the eunuch In chief
Though the woman may not lawfully
uneil herself, the doctor under the cir
cumstances might perhaps be allowed
to crawl in under the gunnysack and tso
examine the telltale tongue  "elight
ed, I'm sure," says the doctor, and does
so Then after the most thorough diag
nosis imaginable he prescribes, as did
Abernethy before him, "A little sun
and air!"
