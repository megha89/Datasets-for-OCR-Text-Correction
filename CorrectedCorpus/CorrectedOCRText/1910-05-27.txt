ENGLEBRIGHT FOR CONGRESS
W F Englebrigh, who has represened he firs disric
for he pas four years, is a candidae for renoininaion ou
he republican icke Superior judge John L Childs of el
Nore couny is also announced as an apirau for his office
on he republican side He is highly recommended by he
press of his home couny, and we hae no doub he is eery
way fied for his posiion of responsibiliy and honor d
miing all his, we see no reason why he republican
pary should make any change of candidae a his ime No
flaw can be found in he official record of Englebrigh He
has V made good in eery sense of he phrase Throughou
he disric his coniuens are perfecly saisfied wih his
work He has been a faihful seran in all hings Men
of more brilliance in oraory hae graced he halls of con
gress, bu a more ireless worker for he ineress of his dis
ric, or of sounder judgmen in direcing his effors oward
he desired end, han W F Englebrigh,"has rarely if eer
been seen in he naional legislaure The passage of he
bill creaing a mining bureau was mainly due o his effors
He has los no opporuniy o faor he mining ineres,
which is he paramoun indusry of his] disric I is poor
policy o change a congressman frequenly I akes one
erm o iniiae a represenaie gino he ways of congress,
and a eeran member can accomplish far more for his dis
ric han a noice The older saes are fully alie o his
fac When hey secure an able and faihful member of con
gress, hey aim o keep him in office, knowing his influence
as a rule grows wih each successie erm This is a policy
ha California will do well o paern afer We beliee he
oers of he firs congressional disric £are conen o le
well enough alone, and will reain Euglebrigh in he office
he has filled so well for he pas years
The agiaion for goernmen ownership of public uiliies
is pressed o he exreme of absurdiy The conseraion
policy in behalf of which so much is being said and wrien,
is he ougrowh of he goernmen ownership quesion, and
he drif of he whole maer is srongly oward socialism
To preen he undue wase of naional resources by he
creaion of as fores reseres, where he spoiler's ax is no
permied excep under sric proecie regulaions, is a
moe ha no one can objec o Bu when mineral lands,
waer power sies, oil lands, are proposed o be wihdrawn
from priae enry, wih he objec in iew of he general go
ernmen eiher rening hese resources or opening and opera
ing hem for he benefi of he people, ha seems like drifing
far ou o sea Een in priae enerprises along hese lines
he failures are many, while he successes are few True,
supendous forunes hae been piled up by a few indiiduals
in such enerprises, bu if he ruh were fully known, he
unforunae adenures ounumber he successes This rule
applies' o eery branch of business The world is so con
siued ha i mus eer remain so, because he inequaliy
arises mainly from he differences in human 'naure Now
he goernmen is bu an aggregaion of indiiduals Is
abiliy o score financial success mus be measured by he
capaciy of he indiiduals charged wih is managemen,
wih he powerful incenie of selfineres supplaned b3' a
ague desire for he general welfare I is conrary o all ex
perience ha goernmenal affairs be carried on wih he
same regard o economy as under priae managemen The
noion ba all he people will paricipae in he profis under
goernmen ownership, as agains he few beneficiaries of
priaely owued concerns, is a dream of impracicable re
formers
We hae reason o beliee ha a few oers hae, from
indifference or oher causes, failed o ge on he grea
regiser as pary meu, when as a maer of fac hey are such
s he dae for he primary elecion draws near, hey will
regre heir acion, inasmuch as unless recified, hey will be
barred from he opporuniy of helping heir pary friends by
heir oe We beliee ha oersighs of his kind may be
correced upon a proper showing wihin he prescribed ime
We hope all republicans who are no regisered as such, will
make early applicaion o hae heir pary affiliaion insered
in he record

In his own McFiee was hung, who

oo, Jeremiah E Grain was hung for
killing Susan Newingham,a young school
girl, one of his pupils, whom he was
madly in loe wih, alhough he had a

D. B. Dougherty, dealer in groceries

gave entire satisfaction in my case and
consequently I do not hesitate to endorse
them. Nine yenrs ago 1 began to suffer
from pains throughout my body. My
kidneys were disordered, the secretions
being' distressing iv passaee and my
back was so lame und painful that I
coulJ not get up from a chair without
using mv hands as a support. When
suffering in that way, 1 began taking
Doan's Kidney Pills and they went
directly to the root of my trouble, re
storing me to good health. I wus ex
amined by a physician not long ago and
was told that there was no symptom of
fault with my kidneys. Doan's, Kidney
Pills deserve all the credit for my pre
sent good health."

company, which has its headquarters in
Par.is. IV.vcr will be supplied by the

generating plant will be erected on the
west hank of the river, and it will be
connected with all the chief towns of

required for the initial expenses. It is
hoped that in five years the work will be
paying well.

Scientist Tries to
Prove Darwin's Theory
Philadelphia.— Dr. Edward Tyson
Relchcrt, investigator and professor of
phychology at the University of Penn
sylvania has published his observations
made in a series of experiments with
blood crystals of animals and men, and
has, he believes, a strong argument in
favor of the Darwin theory of evolution.
His conclusions are based on a study
of 2POO photomicrographic negatives.
These negatives were obtained from the
blood of virtually every species of ani
mal.
Evolution observed from chemical
standpoint is so vast in its possibilities
that it will require the combined efforts
of a hundred investigators working in
cessantly for several generations to com
plete the task, according to Dr. i»'ci
chert.
Not only will the experiments have an
important bearing on the evolutionary
theory, but the ability to distinguish by
comparison of crystals between the
different types of man will be of Im
mense importance in the examination of
blood in murder trials. By Dr. Rei
chert's method it is possible to estab
lish definitely whether the blood is of
man or animal, and to say with a de
gree of positiveness whether it is the
blood of a negro or a white person.

Counterfeit Coins
In Circulation.
Los Angeles— Counterfeit silver money
believed to amount to thousands of
dollars is in circulation here. Hair and
quarter dollars by the hundreds have
been turned in by conductors on all the
trolley lines, and the otticcrs have ob
served that whenever the fare collectors
took in the spurious coin in any parti
cular section of the city, storekeepers
there have also been victimized, in
dicating systematic operations by ex
perts. When the town had been literal
ly flooded with the worthless money,
the smaller daces were worked, and the
interban trainmen began taking in the
imitations, which are the best ever seen
here.
Bulletins of. warning have been issued
by the railway officials, detectives
placed oi' cars and the secret service
operatives notified in vain. The bogus
stream continues flowing in, The
police believe they have traced the
crooks to the Emeryville race track,
where similar coins have been foisted
on patrons of the racing game. The
counterfeiters are supposed to have had
quarters there".
