THE FIERY RAGON
Ancient and Mediaeal escriptions
of the Monster
ragons were important animals In
ancient* and mediaeal natural history
Until comparatiely recent time no
scientist eer thought of questioning
the existence of this most formidable
of beasts The annals of Winchester
for 1177 graely state that "in this year
dragons were seen of { many in j Eng
land" Gesner, prof essor? of natural
history at Zurich, gies a detailed de
scription of the dragon, while Aldro
andus, in his "History" of Serpents
and ragons," published in ICO, de
otes fifty pages to the monster  A
good specimen of a dragon would seem
to hae been a beast about the size of
a sheep, incased in a coat of scales
which shone like siler Its back was
serrated like a saw ; It possessed  a
long tail, a pair of batlike wings, four
heaily clawed feet and a wollne head,
the Jaws  of \ which 'were armed with
ery formidable teeth The tongue
was barbed with fire, and fury Issued
from the monster's mouth, and the head
bore a crest ' ragons were the most
wicked ' and? indictie of creatures
They seem always to hae been in ' a
towering rage and spent | the greater
portion of their time In rushing up and
down the earth destroying eerything
that came in their path The origin of
dragons was a j disputed * point | among
mediaeal naturalists Some maintain
ed that these animals were generated
by the heat of India; others were of
opinion that the olcanoes of Ethiopia
used to belch forth the monsters One
scientist, John Leo by name, declared
the dragon to be a, hybrid, a cross"be
tween an eagle and a wolf
MOESTY OF THE~GRE AT
Gladstone and arwin Felt, Then

to express astonishment at the "mod
esty of the great" The stories are
thesePersonal PersonalJ>^Personal;   Personal  Personal • '
 "Meeting Mr Gladstone in the lobby
and seeing his face saddened by the
troubles in Ireland, Mr Bryce tried to
Siort his 'thoughts by mentioning a
recent" discoery— to wit that ante
had been saed from want in his last
years' by a lectureship at Raenna Mr
Gladstone's face lit up at once,, and he
gaid, 'How; strange It is to think that
these great "souls, whose works are a
beacon light to all the generations that
hae come after them, should hae" had
rares and anxieties to ex them in their
daily life Just like the'rest of us com
mon mortals!'  Personal
"The words reminded me," adds the
author, "that a few days before I had
heard Mr" arwin, in dwelling upon
the pleasure a isit paid by Mr Glad
stone had gien him, say, 'And he talk
ed just as if he had been an ordinary

A POET'S ALOOFNESS
The Manner I Which Words wortV
Wm Regarded by His Neighbors
;,,The worthies of Wordsworth's fil
lage in the lake  country • of • England
had their own ideas of his alue as a
man ; and a poet , When questioned
after his death as to ; his personality
they readily admitted that he was kind
to those who were in sickness or need'
They could count on him on a pinch
But he did not hobnob with his neigh
bors
//'He did not notice them much," said
in old man i answer to questions
isked by the author of "Lake Country
Sketches" *" 'j !
"A Jem Crow and an auld blue cloal;
Was his rig," continued the old hian
"And as for his habits, " he had noan
Nier knew him with "a pot i' his hand
er a pipe i' his, mouth"
After deep probing the author brought
outPersonal 
 " "Yes; Wordsworth was fond •of ' a
good dinner at times if you could Ret
him to it That was the job"
Then the poet's aloofness was again
touched upon
"He was foreer pacing the roads
and Ills own garden walks and always
composing poetry He was ter'blc
throng in isitors and folks ye man
ken at times, but if he could get awa'
fra  them a spell he was out upon his
walk
 "And then he would set his head a
bit forrad and put his hands behint his
back And then he would start aburn

Xot a Good Looker
From the mountains of Camden, Me,
comes a story of a Philadelphia mer
chant who has a summer cottage in
that illage and who wished to ex
change a liely horse which he owned
with a French Canadian who had a
more gentle animal, which women and
children could drie ; The Frenchman
was willing to trade, but for some rea
son insisted upon repeating to the is
itor that the local horse did not "look"
as well as the one belonging to the
Philadelphia man
,An exchange satisfactory to both
parties was eentually made, and the
first time the isitor's wife took the
new horse out for a drie she disco
ered that the beast was as blind as a
mole ' A few days later, when the rus
tlcator met the Frenchman, he saidPersonal '•

AN OL CHURCH BELL
»T CAME FROM LISBON; AN HANGS
" IN A NANTUCKET CHURCH
The Story of Its Purchase by Captain'
Claaby and Its Transportation to
I This Country— A Very Good j Clock
and  a Very Fine Bell
,\ Beneath the outlook in a Nantuckct
thurch is the belfry, in which swings
the "old Spanish bell''" Knowing" that
tills is now a Unitarian church, the is
itor will be surprised to see a Catholic
cross on the bell Jlf he could read Por
tuguese and had not preiously ac
quainted 1 himself with the history ; of
the 1 bell he would be  still more sur
prised at the ' inscription 'on  it' ' | The
translation of this Inscription is as fol
lowsPersonal "To the Good Jesus of the Moun
tain the deotees of Lisbon direct their
iwayers, offering Him one complete set
of six bells, to call the people to adore
him in' his sanctuary Jose omlngos
acosta has made it in Lisbon In tho
year 1810" Of course the bell r must
hae an interesting history to account
for this inscription That history is
briefly as followsPersonal 
A plague "was raging in Lisbon and
certain Personal people in that city  prayed to
the , Virgin Mary for the cessation of
the plague and owed to place a set of
six bells in the Church of the Good
Jesus of the Mountain If their prayers
were heard "The Mountain" is the
name of a certain district in the city
of Lisbon in which there is a ery en
erable church called as aboe Shortly
after, this the plague ceased, and, ac
cepting this ' as the answer '; to their
prayers, these deotees of Lisbon pro
ceeded to fulfill their ows The work
of casting these six bells was Intrusted
to Jose omingos acosta, the best
bell founder In Lisbon
 The six bells had been cast, the mas
ter's labors had  been crowned with
success, when Captain Clasby of , the
Nantucket whaling fleet chanced to
isit Lisbon  He had long wished to
buy a bell for use in his natie town?
In company with Captain Cary he
isited the bell foundry of ' Jose Personal o
• mingos * acosta Captain  Cary, it
seems, was a connoisseur in bells 7 a
costa applied the leer to one bell after
another as he struck each to ascertain
its peculiar tone or tone quality, but
each time Captain Cary said, "That
will not do" 
At last acosta raised and struck
the bell whose history we are describ
' ing Captain Cary was delighted with
the result "Ah, Olasby," he ' said,
"you need look no further That's the
bell you want She is a beauty She
sounds on B" '
"Well," sir," remarked acosta, "we
consider that to be the finest bell that
we hae in our foundry"  
At first acosta demurred and could
not see his way clear to selling the
bell, since It belonged to the set of
chimes designed for the Church of the
Good Jesus of the Mountain and was
appropriately inscribed and all, but
Captain Clasby would hae no other
Finally acosta decided, since the bell
had not yet been consecrated and since
he could cast another to take its place,
that it would be all right to sell" 
So Captain Clasby bought the bell,
andPersonal it was brought to Nantucket by
Captain Cary, whose essel was going
home' first In Lisbon,' Just before he
set sail Captain Cary heard of the dec
laration of war with Great Britain,
for It was now the year 1812 On the
way oer they were spoken by a Brit
ish sloop of war Fortunately the Brit
isher had been at sea for some time
and had not yet beard of the declara
tion of war "The commander asked
Captain Cary the news, but Captain
Cary says he took especial pains not
to tell all he knew If he had told, our
precious bell would probably neer
hae seen Nantucket It might now be
either at the bottom of the sea or it
mightbe swinging in the tower of
some English church
The bell Personal was landed in Nantucket
and placed in the store cellar, of Sam
uel Cary, where it remained until 1815,
when it was purchased and placed in
the tower where it now hangs About
$500 was gien for the bell — the society
paid about $350 and the rest was raised
by subscription Een some Friends
or Quakers subscribed
After the bell had been in use a little
while the agents of the historic  Old
South church in Boston heard of It, and
they sent a letter to the agents of the
South church in Nantucket, saying that
they had a ery good clock in their
tower,, but no bell; that they had heard
that the South j church in Nantucket
had a ery fine bell, and they would
like to know for how much the bell
could be bought
The* Nantucketers replied that they
had a ery fine bell In their tower, but
no clock; that they had heard that the
Old South church had a ery fine tower
clock, and that they would like to
know the price of the clock )
 ' The agents offered to pay $1 a pound
for the bell Since the bell weighs
1,575 pounds, this would hae made
the price $1,575, making & net profit of
?1,075 aboe the price paid for the bell
and $1,225 aboe the amount contrib
uted by the society It seems that the
old Nantucketers must hae had some
sentiment after all and were not purely
mercantile in their spirit
If the Nantucketers had agreed to
Bell, as they might hae done, our bell
would probably be hanging In the his
toric tower of Old South church in
Boston today That might hae been
a great honor for the bell, but it would
hae been a great depriation for Nan
tucket Moreoer, it would now be
spending Its time in elegant leisure in
stead of being a ery useful bell where
It Is The history of this bell is like a
eritable parable of human life The
possibilities which occur in the history
of the bell remind us of the possibilities
which abound in eery life — Cor

Looking Under the Hat
You seldom will find a brainy man
with ar ound head ,' The ; head that
contains lots lof brains either Is ery
long from , front ; to back ;or  else f ir
regular You can  learn something of
a man's mental ability by the hat he
wears \ It his head is so bumpy, that
it seems as if he neer could get a hat
to fit him he probably is a genius! or
a crackaJack in some particular line
If his head is long from front to back
he is a clear thinker and smart as a
whip, j So if your hat costs more mon
ey than your friend's hat does and
you are harder to fit be consoled ;by
considering that your  brain is worth
more— New York Press  S^Pif^JS
Peebles
Personal In the "Memoir" of Robert Chambers
by his brother William is a delightful
allusion to Peebles, their birthplace and
a spot eer warm in the loing mem
ory of Scotch residents
One of these, a man who had lied
there all his life, was enabled by some
uplift of fortune to isit Paris When
he came back his townsmen graely
gathered about him
"Noo," said one, while the others lis
tened, "tell us aboot It" ,
"Paris,", he began, "a' things consid
ered, is a wonderfu' place; but, still,
Peebles for pleasure"
The Thumb
Thumbs hae been appreciated oer
since the world began The ancients
used to call the thumb the other band
Barbarous kings used to swear and
make compacts' by their thumbs • 'In
Rome it was a sign of faor to wring
and kiss the thumb and of disfaor
or disgrace to lift it up or turn it out
ward A man who was hurt in his
thumbs was excused from sering in
the Roman wars Some of the scoun
drelly citizens used to cut off their
thumbs so as to remain at home and
get rich Teachers used to punish their
pupils by biting their thumbs

THE ANELION
No More Successful Plant and None
More Wonderfml
Perhaps none of our plants is more
common ; or [ more familiar than ~\ the
dandelion,' and certainly none is more
wonderful , First of all it is not a na
tie, but was Introduced from Europe,
whence hae come many of our worst
weeds, fitted by centuries of struggle in
cultiated fields to oercome * the j na
tie" plants of a continent where culti
ation had preiously been practically
unknown and where naties had had
no opportunity of adapting themseles
to the conditions ef ciilized agricul
ture    '_ 'Personal'{  '  r  s t 'f
One "of Personal the dandelion's strongest
points is the ability to obtain nourish
ment under strong competition and in
unfaorable situations A deep, strong;
perennial taproot draws all aailable
nourishment and moisture Personal  from Personal sur
face and subsoil, stores nourishment
during the winter • and enables the
plant to start far and away, ahead of
most of its competitors This same tap
root is exceedingly bitter, which ery
likely protects it from destruction by
moles and other animals At least I
do not remember haing seen "a root
that had been disturbed by animals of
any kind '
Personal But only a small portion of its food
comes from the soil Air and sunshine
are Just as necessary, for ; the air is
food and the sunshine Is digestion for
our  egetable neighbors  Note  the
shape of the leaes Narrow at the
base and widening at the outer end,
they form a dense rosette that not only
gets for the dandelion all the air and
sunshine coming its way, but smothers
all but the most sturdy competitors
Here lies the secret of the dandelion's
presence in lawns and walks and open
waste I places, j jln lawns \ the grass jis
kept low so that it cannot oertop and
shade the dandelion, while its own
leaes lie so low and close that they
are little hurt by the mower and can
smother, the grass underneath — Har

THE SALOON QUESTION
The board of superisors took no
action in the liquor license question
at its last meeting They probably
realize, as do the thoughtful business
men throughout the county, that it
is not the simple matter to deal with
as some are inclined to beliee The
Ledger has always been, aud will
always be, the adocate of morality
'in public as well as in priate life
It recognizes that the instructors of
religion and morality are engaged in
a iioble work for the uplifting of
humanity, and eery encourage
ment should be afforded them in the
prosecution ,of their mission • At,
the same time the Ledger does, not
beliee in legal measures which hae,
or are intended to hae, a prohibi
tory effect,' in the interest of refor
mation That the number of saloous
in the towns of Amador county is
beyond the necessities of the popu
lation scarcely any one will deny
It does not follow from this ad
mission, howeer, that any and
eery attempt to reduce their num
ber or regulate the liquor traffic
must necessarity be commendable
or wise The object sought to be
attained may be worthy of encour
agement, while the means used to
accomplish that end may be deser
ing of censure The liquor habit is
the greatest curse that afflicts the
ciilized world In the 'United
States it dries more ictims to dis
honored graes eery year than
were killed during the ciil war
How to lessen the eil withoutrtres
passing upon indiidual liberty is a
problem that has occupied the minds
of philanthropists and statesmen for
generations, and is as far from a
solution today as it eer was, It is
easy to talk of suppressing the man
ufacture and sale of intoxicants; it
is quite a different thing to carry
out such a program The stuff is
manufactured because there is a de
mand for it It stands on the same
business footing as any other indus
try The industry thries when the
demand increases; it will decline
when the demand decreases When
the moralists succeed in so changing
human nature as to take away the
appetite for strong drink, the prob
lem will be soled — probably not till
then  * J • ';
The superisors of Amador are
asked to try to curtail the eil by
limiting the number of saloons; by
making it obligatory upon the ap
plicant for a license to first secure
the signatures of a majority of the
residents of the neighborhood where
the proposed saloon is to be started;
also to increase the license to such a
sum as will close out the saloon men
of small means These are radical
departures from the methods which
hae been followed in this county
eer since it was organized It is
well for the county managers to pon
der these propositions well before
taking action People look with
disfaor upon anything in the nature
of a monopoly, especially if the
 monopoly is icous in its nature and
tendency, and fostered by legislatie
enactment Those at the head of
affairs hae to consider the subject
from its manysided iew points, not
from the exclusie standpoint of ab
stract morality We can easily
understand how injudicious action
might work a serious injury to tho
county at large, without accom
plishing any appreciable benefit
The supreme court in the case of
Maddux s Walthall ou appeal from
tbe superior court of Stanislaus
county, has a^ain reiterated the
opinion that a distinguishing mark
placed upon a ballot — whether it be
a lejjal mark illegally placed, or an
illegal mark made by the oter for
the purpose of identifying the ballot,
inalidates such ballot The case
went up mainly on the stamping of
atrossin the square opposite the
words "No nomination" The parties
were rial candidates for the oflice
of district attorney, and the contest
hinged upon the question whether
the ballots marked after the words
"No nomination" should be counted
It was eident that these marks
were not made for the purpose of
identifying the ballots Neerthe
less ' the supreme court maintains
that the intent of the oter Jcould
not be inquired into The crosses
were illegally stamped, whether in
tentionally or not made no differ
ence; they should be rejected This
decision will definitely settle the
point inoled, and hereafter nomi
nating conentions will do well to
see that such dangerous snags do
not appear on the party ticket
Eery office should be "supplied
with a candidate, oen though
there be lii tie hope of electing the
nominee This action is imperatie
ly demanded as a protection to the
other nominees
As a rule, the man with capital in
seeking a field for inestment, inari
ably prefers that locality in which his
money not only earns a profit, but
where the natural conditions, aided by
economical methods, make hfs "enture
safe as well Like other enterprises, of
course, in which inestors embark,
mining sometimes, either through lack
of judgment, bad management, or lack
of confidence sufficient to reach the
goal sought, proes a failure; tho in
estor loses his mooey and the district
gets a black eye from which in requires
time to recoer While instances of
this character hae occurred in this
county in the past, they are of ho more
frequent occurrence here, than in the
aerage mining community In fact,
this is true of any mineral country
where the ore bodies are proen boyond
the perad enture of a doubt In Ama
dor county the mining industry passed
the embryonic stage years ago Tho
mother lode is not a conjecture The
constant roar of stamps which greets
the ear on eery hand along this now
famous lode should  be', and are, suf
ficient eidence, to the man looking for
profitable inestments, that this coun
ty's mineral resources offer reasonable
inducements
Aa a mineral producing county A ma
dor's claims for merit hae long since
been proen, but because tfe~6f the
county know that its hills abound in
the precious metal in paying quantities
is no reason why we should rest on our
oars, as it were, and let it go at that
No enterprising, man of business is satis
fied to purchase a large stock of goods
and quietly sit down and wait for cus
tomers to come his way He immedi
ately sets about to let the people know
that he has goods to sell; that their
quality is of the best, and that his in
ducements are fair So we who are in
terested in the progress and prosperity
of 'this county— and this applies to
eery man and woman resident here—
should awaken to the full realization of
its great industrial prospects, and, at
the beginning of this new year resole,
and put the resolution into action, to
place the resources of the county in a
more faorable light before the inest
ing public than eer before The re
sults of united igorous effort cannot
be estimated  • ••

Probably Mayhem
On Friday eening of last week, New
Year's night, a difficulty occurred at
the Fassero boarding house, Jackson
Gate, which will probably result in the
placing of a charge of mayhem against
one of the principals It seems that
Paul and Antone Aansini, stopping at
the boarding house, wore treating their
fellow boarders to a ocal duet, which
was not so well receied In fact, the
lady of the boarding house and seeral
of the guests endeaored to cast a
damper on the musical ability of the
singers by a little harmless ridicule
This was effectie, and all thought
the incident closed, as nothing more
was thought of the matter It seems
the supposed insult rankled in the
hearts of the Aansinis, for on the fol
lowing eening they attacked Mrs
Fassero' This brought the other
members of the household to the rescue,
and in the general mixup which fol
lowed, Antone Aansini succeeded in
fastening his teeth just oer the eye of
one of his assailants, and by the hold
secured dragged the man into the street,
where the piece of flesh, including a
portion of the eyebrow, was torn loose,
and it is said he managed to
swallow the disseered flesh He
and his brother Paul were promptly
arrested SuntJay eening and placed in
the county jail, where they are being
held to await the return of the district
attorney, who is now in the city, and
sufficient recoery of the ictim, whose
name could not be learned, to enable
him to make the complaint
THE AMAOR LEGERPersonal JACKSON, CALIFORKI A, FRIAY, JANUARY 8, 190
Assault With eadly Weapon
Antone Badaracca is wanted by the
officers on a charge of assault to com
mit murder Perhaps more so than
any other indiidual in Amador county,
he has gien the peace officers employ
ment in hunting him up at arious
times for a number of years He lies
with his father on the Badaracca ranch
a couple of miles south of town The
quietude of that retreat was broken
last Sunday by Antone, while under
the Influence of wine, taking the war
path It is said he shot at his father,
and also took a' shot, at Jos Gara
baldi, who works on the ranch The
shots fortunately went wide of the mark
Constable Laerone wont to tbe Bada
racca place the same eening, but
Antone was not at home; furthermore
he was told there had been no disturb
ance there Monday, howeer, Gara
baldi came to town, and swore to a
warrant of arrest, and the same een
ing Sheriff Norman and deputy' Jack
son went out to arrest the accused, but
found him missing He is eidently in
hiding until the excitement has sub
dided The trouble heretofore has been
that the charges hae not been prose
cuted owing to the relenting of  the
complaining witness, from a desire to
screen the accusedPersonal
Later — On Thursday morning, he
haing learned that Badaracca had re
turned, Sheriff Norman,' eputy Jack
son, and Constable Laerone started
out early after their man, and by nine
o'clock had him safely landed in the
county jail He was found alone and
in bed in a cabin near the scene of the
trouble, and was exceedingly tame
when the officers made the arrest
Bait oer the Sweepstake Mine
The deal oer the muchadertised
Sweepstake grael claim in Trinity
county has finally culminated in a law
suit against the endors of the prop
erty — Judge John F ais, of this
county, who is now code commissioner
of the state, E A ais, his brother,
and Frank' Hall of San Francisco The
allegations of the complaint filed in tho
superior court of San Francisco against
the defendants are of a highly sensa
tional character/  efendants, it is
claimed, being owners of practically all
the stock of the Sweepstake Gold Min
ing and itch Company, entered into
an agreement in March 1901 with the
plaintiff, Robert J Anderson, bonding
said property for the sum of M000,000
to be paid in instalments of $125,000
Two instalments were paid, making
$250,000, and something like $700,000
were spent in putting the property in
shape  for • working' on a large scale
Prior to the consummation of the
agreement, the purchaser isited the
property, and made a test of its gold
bearing qualities, which proed so
satisfactory that the negotiations were
pushed to completion In July IPO2,
howeer, the complaint recites, it was
discoered that the mine was salted,
which in mining parlance means that
tbe gold obtained ' from the testing
operations was not natieborn, but
had been injected into the mine with
fraudulent intent Judgment is asked
for the rescinding of tho agreement
and the recoery of $850,000 — the
amount paid on the purchase price and
outlay in ? opening up the mine, with
interest This is the substance of this
highly flaored suit • The Ledger re
frains from comment, as the true facts
will no doubt be brought to light when
the case comes up for trial

MINING NEWS HERE
AN ELSEWHERE
Amador's Thriing Industry — Its
Mines Hae Long Since Passed the
Prospectie Stage— News in General
EL Monte— A meeting of the
directors of the el Monte Mining and
Milling Company was held last Mon
day, when an assessment of ten cents
per share was leied, which will realize
about $5000 This amount it is be
lieed, will be sufficient to pay off the
indebtedness, and also enablo the tun
nel to be pushod forward to the point
where it is expected to intersect the
ledge— a  distance of about 150 feet
This work is absolutely necessary to
determine the alut; of the property,
and although the assessment reaches
the maximum limit of ten ' per cent of
the par alue of the stock, it was
deemed best under the circumstances
to ley the full amount at once rather
than diide it into two assessments
The* Wide Awake— This property
is owned by the Consolidated Wide
Awake M is M Co, and is located in
Railroad Flat mining district, just
acPersonal oss the lino of Amador in Calaeras
county Up to the present time the
efforts of the company hae been ex
pended in the thorough, deelopment
of the mine, and as a result it is now in
a condition to furnish ore sufficient to
supply a tenstamp mill Just recently
a mill of that capacity has been com
pleted, and Manager Wright expects
to put it in operation today The
property is wprked by a 130foot shaft,
and 200 feet of drifting has been done
at the 60foot leel, where on each side
is a good chute of ore The ore is free
milling, but it has been decided to also
rnaico and sae concentrates
Hooligan — All of /Araador's min
eral resources are by no means confined
to the mother lode An instance in
point is the Hooligan, owned and now
being operated by a company of that
name This property is located in
Pioneer mining district, near the e
fender, one of the bost paying mines in
the district The owners of the Hooli
gan hae just completed a 10foot tun*
net which cuts tho ledge at consider
able depth, and although as yet its ex
tent has not beon determined, a recent
assay by Weisenbein Bros, San Fran
cisco, furnishes abundant assurance of
its alue The return as shown to a
representatie of this paper, by Tom
Smith, one of the owners, gies a alue
of 819 ounces gold and 862 ounces sil
er to the ton They are quite jubi
lantoer the prospect, and are pushing
work as rapidly as possible to the end
of adding the Hooligan to Amador's
list of pay mining propositions at a
ery early date
Kennedy— To Personali person accustomed
to seeing largo mining operations a trip
to" tho Kennedy is a treat indeed, whore
eerything is bustle anil industry At
both the south and east shafts the top
operations are indicatie of much work
in the drifts and stopes bolow Besides
the constant deelopments being dono
in the mine, the company is making
added improemetils to the plantaboe
ground At piweiit the foundations
are complete for the aWiliou of three
new boilers to the boiler plant, and the
boilers are jast beiug placed, which will
increase the numbar to io When
this work has been finished] the lifting
capacity of the hoist can be deeloped
to 1000 horse power, although at the
present depth being worked only about
650 horse power is used ' The hoist just
completed by the AHisChaltners com
pany, is capable of drawing rock from
a depth of 000 feet, and now' hoists
skip loads of 66 cubic feet, or 6600
pounds of rock at tho rate of 2200 feet
per minute, but when taxed to its full
strength is capable of raising 17800
pounds at the i ame rate per minute
In the mill at the east shaft ten moro
stamps were started up on Monday,
and Supt Smith expects to hae the
remaining ton of the sixty pounding
ore within the next week The es
tablishment of a plant of hoisting ma
chinery of so great capactity makes a
new era in mining in this county, and
the results obtained will be watched
with interest by mining men generally
MISCELLANEOUS
• We understand there are about 30
men employed at the New York mine,
Railroad Flat district, deeloping tho
property
News reached this offlco during the
week that the 10stamp mill on the
Whitmore property, Volcano district,
had been completed, and is now pound
ing away on oro 
Work on the Argonaut, next to the
Kennedy, is progressing nicely, and as
the mine is being gotten in shape for
operations, tho force is being gradually
increased A station is now being cut
at the 1800foot leel, and as soon as
finished drifting to the lodge will be
started, and pushod as rapidly as pos
sible In addition to this tho work of
unwatering the lower leels will con
tinue, and when accomplished, sinking
will bo resumed
Charles  Lane, general manager of
the Wild Goose mine, Nome, Alaska,
from whence ho has just recently re
turned, passed through town Monday
en route to Plymouth, where he has
mining interests It is hoped that his
isit at this time may hao for its ob
ject the resumption of operations on
the property of the Plymouth Con
solidated
At the present time good news rela
tie to the outlook in Pioneer district
is quite frequent Among its other
good prospects is the doelopmont be
ing done on their property, near the
efender, by J W Fisher and W E
Moore They hae sunk a 30foot
shaft, and are now drifting south,
about  feet from tho foot wall At 15
feet from the shaft a dyke has been en
countered where the ore body seems to
hae pinched up, but the grade is fairly
good, as tests hae shown a alue of
about $0 to the ton in gold They
hae, howeer, had an assay as high as
$11310 to the ton The owners are
confident the present deelopment will
warrant the erection of a plant to treat
the ore, and just as soon as experi
ments hae determined the most prac
ticable method, arrangements will be
made, to that end

COLLAR AN CRAVAT
Ways In Which They Affect the Ap
pearance of the Wearer
Men who do not want to 16bk~any
fatter in the face than they can help
hae an  easy means of accomplishing
their purpose Not all of them are
aware of the effect that may be created
by the form of a collar or craat
"The stout man who wants to look as
thin as he can," said a haberdasher's
clerk, "ought to wear a tie of the kind
known as a fourinhand Preferably
It should be dark in color and drawn
tight That carries down the line of
the face' and lengthens it to a degree
that tends to make the face look thin
ner
"Another aid to making a man look
thin is in the height of his collars
Stout men who want to look thin
should wear high collars and closed
ones Any collar that opens in front
makes • one look stouter under nearly
eery circumstance Such collars are
becoming to the thin men
"The fat man should aoid the kind
of tie that has a horizontal effect This
will add pounds to his appearance — in
his face, at least
"On the contrary, this cross effect
will make the thin man look stout
The broad scarfs hae little effect on a
man's looks one way or the other
When he wears them it Is the 'collar
that makes the difference
"lie should therefore see that he
wears a high one that does not open if
he wants to look as thin as possible,
whereas if he wants to seem stouter an
open collar will produce that effect for
him"

idn't Care to Be Presented
The wife of a well known naal offi
cer tells an amusing story of some of
her experiences in Washington society
On one occasion when she was asked to
receie at an army and nay germun a
congressman entered with a lady lean
ing upon each arm One of the floor
committee at once approached him,
with the polite request that he gie his
name in order that he might be pre
sented to Mrs Blank, who receied the
guests of the eening
"No, thank you," was the nonchalant
reply "I don't care to be introduced
I hae two ladles now to take care of,
and that is about as much as I can
manage"
Becoming iscouraged
He— Your father did not object to our
marriage as much as I had expected
She— Oh, poor papa has gien up the
Idea of being too particular— Brooklyn

A NOTORIOUS CORPS
The French Foreign Legion and Its
 angerous Characters
The death penalty awarded a priate
In the French foreign legion for throw
ing his cap in his captain's face at
Orun is an illustration of the merciless
seerity exercised in that famous corps
Shooting at sight is permitted the of
ficers, who hae to deal with dangerous
characters from all quarters of Europe
Nowhere is there such a corps, ac
cording to the London Chronicle Its
ranks are recruited from outcasts of
all social ranks isgraced officers of
the Russian serice, deserters from the
German army, broken scions of the
Anstrlim nobility, fraudulent debtors
from Belgium,  forgers from Spain,
homicides from America, ruined gam
blers from Italy, are found in plenty
In the ranks No excuse is taken for a
fault, and the slightest symptom of In
subordination carries with it a swift
passage to another world It is under
stood that recruits are simply seeking
refuge from the arm of the ciil law
The foreign legion is the only olun
tarily enlisted corps in the French
army It has done excellent serice
against the Arabs and is always, placed
in the forefront of the fight
The Harmless Grass Snake
The poor, harmless grass snake Is the
subject of stories almost as wonderful
as those related of the adder The
superstition that, howeer much you
may hammer it, it will not die till the
setting of the sun is widely held A
fable not so generally held to is that
een at sundown it will not die if you
should neglect to tell some one of what
you hae done The rule on seeing one
of these, terrible creatures is to "hit It
and ; tell"— that is, gie It a good drub
bing and run quickly and tell some one
The best snake story is from Leigh
Sinton, near Malern, according to a
London correspondent A laborer
states that he had killed a grass snake
and hung it on a tree The blood
dripped down and a toad came and
swallowed some, dying instantly! ,
The fancy that makes this species
poisonous or een harmful is a wild
one, but how much more wild Is that
which attributes iolent toxic proper
ties to any 'chance drop of blood from
its body! It might hae been thought
that the other popular belief that poi
sonous things cannot be poisoned would
hae saed the life of the poor toad —
London Express,
What Columbus Might Hae one
There are relaties of Columbus li
ing in Spain at the present time It is
said that gambling debts are keeping
them poor These persons look to the
United States with wistful eyes, hoping
that some patriotic American will con
fer on them a few millions in recogni
tion of their distinguished ancestor
This fact led a statistician to work his
brain, and he published the statement
that had Columbus placed $1 at com
pound interest at 0 per cent 00 years
ago his descendants today would pos
sess a sum amounting to more than
$8,000,000,000 When these figures were
published Lyman J Gage was secre
tary of the treasury His attention
was called to the tremendous possibil
ity of a single dollar, and his comment
was either a sincere remark or a well
adapted pun He said, "Indeed, to me
this is a story of great interest"
Honors Were Busy
"In the church 'I attended as a boy,"
said a New York man, "there were fre
quent clashes between the minister
and the choir The minister thought
the choir irreerent and unmusical
The choir thought him a back number
Each tried to gie the other a dig on
eery possible occasion
"One Sunday, I remember, there was
a clash wherein the honors were about
een The minister, after the choir
had sung the opening hymn, said with
a significant smile, that his text would
be from Acts xx,' And after the uproar
was ceased' But the choir, at the ser
mon's end, retorted neatly with the
anthem, 'It Is Time to Awake From
Sleep"'
The StickPersonal Insect of Borneo

mens thirteen inches in length hae

In a remarkable manner a piece of

tween the Insect and the bark Borneo
Is also the home of one of the largest
species of dragon fly A specimen of
the subfamily sesebna measures six
Inches and a half from wing to wing
and is endowed with a correspondingly
strong body
Boston Could Stand It
Ralph Waldo Emerson once made a
crushing reply to a man who asked
him whether the people in Boston did
not feel alarmed Said Emerson,
"What about?" Said the man, "Why,
the world is coming to an end next
Monday" Emerson repliedPersonal "I'm glad
of It We can get along a great deal
better wlthoutlt"
A Slight Fire
"I say, Miss e Witt," remarked
young Sapleigh, "youh wesplendent
beauty sets me bwain on fire, doncher
know?"
"Neer mind, Mr Sapleigh," replied
Miss e Witt, "the conflagration will be
too insignificant to necessitate the call

THE TOWN OF YAFA
Famous In History and the Host In*
terestlns Spot In Palestine
Yafa is a little town that was many
times destroyed alike by Jews, Assyr
ians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans aud
Turks It was to Yafa that Hiram,
kiug of Tyre, sent the cedar wood "in
flotes" which from there were taken
to Jerusalem for Solomon's temple'
Jonah sailed from this ' little town to
Tarshlsh when fleeing from the face of
the Lord It was In Yafa that the
bumble orcas lied her life of good
deeds and upon her dying was raised
to life by Peter To this shore the
great Richard Coeur de Lion swam,
girded in armor, fighting for Christen
dom, and won a ictory for the cru
saders oer the Arab Bonaparte left
a memory of his cruelty here by his
massacre of seeral thousand prisoners
and the poisoning or some persons af
flicted with the plague | Simon the tan
ner's house, where Peter learned that
all nations were acceptable before
God, is one of the few sights to be
seen in Yafa In the courtyard there
is a large well of spring Personal water, and
from the roof of the house a most
beautiful iew of the surrounding
country presents itself Another site
of Interest In the tomb of Tabitha,
which stands in the garden of the
Greek monastery, close to an old foun
tain, among the orange groes and
fruit orchards Of all towns in Pales

HOW HE BECAME A LAWYER
rke Story of John* Sherman's A tl
misston to the Bar
When John Sherman was quite
roung he was taken Into the law office

lelf generally useful One day when he
was In  his twentyfirst year he took
Charles one side and quietly asked him
for a loan of ?50
"What!" Charles exclaimed "What
Io you intend doing with so much
money?" I
"1 am going to Columbus to be ad
mitted to the bar," John replied
Charles was greatly surprised, aa
lohn had neer asked him for any ad
rice regarding the profession nor had
he eer appeared to be Interested to any
extent in the study of law
"You can't be admitted to the bar
/ithout some knowledge of the law,"
laid Charles Personal  ; '   ' "'
John maintained that he knew more
about law than  some others and as
rared his brother that he would try to
raise the money somewhere
"You know," he added, "it will be
necessary for me to hae respectable
clothes and enough money to pay my
traeling and hotel expenses"
Charles finally j ordered the clothes
and proided him with the necessary
money At Columbus on the day he
became of age John was admitted to
the bar On his return he said to
Charlesf
"I am going to lowa to practice law"
Charles remonstrated with him
"There is room for both of us to prac
tice law here in Mansfield," Charles
told him
They then and there became partners"
and continued to practice together un
til  the formation of the Republican
party, when John was sent from the
Mansfield district as a representatie
In congress
Later he was elected to the United
States senate, and the balance of his
life became a ery important and in

THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE
Valuable Territory It raught to the
United State*
The upper portion of the Louisiana
purchase was known as the territory of
Louisiana It comprised all that terri

latitude, eastward to the Mississippi
and westward and northward as far as
the undetermined boundaries of the
newly acquired possessions might ex
tend South of this was the district of
Orleans, with its seat of goernment
fixed at New Orleans The cession of
the upper part of the purchase did not
take place until March 10, 180, when;
haing receied the cession from the
Spanish, the French representatie
handed it oer to the agent of the Unit
ed States with a ery brief and simple
ceremony  •
By these unimpressie proceedings
the goernment of the United States
was put in possession of territory with
in jwhose boundaries now flourish the
states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Missou

MARINE ART
Virtues and efects ot , the Ships
That Sailors Faint
It is an axiom with sailors that there
neer was a man who put in three
years before the mast who did 'not
think he could paint a ship better than
the most skillful landlubber that eer
wielded a brush In the homes of re
tired sea captains specimens of this
kind of marine art are often displayed
on the walls to ndciiring friends and
are handed down as family heirlooms
A good place for the man who has no
seagoing relaties or j friends to see
such pictures Is in some of the win
dows of ship supply stores on South
street in New YorkPersonal Sailors buy them
occasionally
Ships that sailors paint are absolutely
correct In eery detail From a brig to
a full rigged three master there is not a
block or tackle missing from stem to
stern or from masthead to water line
No marine painter could get in half so
much detail if he tried But the ships
painted by sailors look as if they were
caught fast in frost tipped waes
There is absolutely no life or any sug
gestion of motion about them een
when represented as going under full
sail When a sailor tries to get in a bit
of landscape as a background, as he
usually does, he makes matters hope
lessly worse As a general thing it is a
lighthouse or a fort looking for all the
world like little images that children
take out of their toy arks— New York

iagnosing; Under ifficulties
rSundberg, former consul to Bag
dad, related with much gusto an ad
enture that befell him in a Moham
medan harem in Bagdad One of the
wies of a rich merchant fell sick, and
r' Sundberg was called in to prescribe
for her With a pardonable scientific
interest the western physician waited
Enter a black gunnysack It is the pa
tient The doctor would like to feel her
pulse A white hand is slipped through
an opening Good And her tonguef
impossible! No man sae her husband
may see the face of a woman and lie
or, more accurately, no woman j may
uneil her face to any man sae her
husband and lie His professional in
terest aforesaid deeply aroused, the dip
lomatic doctor insists The difficulty is
at length soled by the eunuch in chief
Though the woman may not lawfully
uneil herself, the doctor under the cir
cumstances might perhaps be allowed
to crawl in under the gunnysack and so
examine the telltale tongue "elight
ed, I'm sure," says the doctor," and does
so Then after the most thorough diag
nosis imaginable he prescribes,* as did
Abernethy before him, "A little sun
and air!"
