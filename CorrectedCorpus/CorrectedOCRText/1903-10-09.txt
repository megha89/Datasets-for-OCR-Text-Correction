Testing the Lungs
raw in as much breath as you con
eniently can, then count as long as
possible, in a slow^nnd audible oice
without drawing In more breath The
number of seconds must be carefully
noted In a consumptie the time does
not exceed ten and Is frequently
less than six seconds; In pleurisy and
pneumonia it ranges from nine to four
seconds When the lungs are sound
the time will range as high' as from
twenty to thirtyfie seconds To ex
pand the lungs go Into the air, stand
erect, throw back the head and shoul
ders and draw in the air through Ihe
nostrils a? much as possible
After haing then filled the lungs
raise your arms, still extended, and
suck in the air When you hae thus
forced the arms backward, with the
chest open, change the process by
which you draw m your breath, till
the lungs are emptied Go through the
process seeral times a day, and It will
enlarge the chest, gie the lungs bet

Microscopic Penmanship
The subject of microscopic workman
ship really diides itself into two
classes — penmanship and mechanical
construction History has handed down
to us many examples of this form of
caligraphic mania, of which the chief
symptom Is a desire to compress the
greatest number of words into the
smallest possible space
Pliny the Younger declares that Cicero
once saw the "Iliad" written so small
that it could be inclosed in a walnut
shell This affirmation was regarded
as improbable until the seenteenth
century, when Hue't, bishop of
Aranches, France, an excellent Greek
scholar, proed that it could be ac
complished
The gospel of St John and the Acts
of the Apostles were written within
the circumference of a farthing In the
sixth century by an Italian monk
BURGLARIOUS STARS
Planets and Sana May Pick lit Minor
Solar Bodies
Jupiter is much the biggest member
of the family of stars which reole
around our sun; consequently the pow
er of his attraction is greater than that
possessed, if or instance, by the earth
Jupiter's exploits as a burglar hae
caused ery considerable annoyance
and Inconenience to astronomers in
the days before his" powers were fully
recognized  
In 1770 there appeared a fine comet
Which was found to hae an elliptical
orbit round the sun of so comparatiely
small a size that Mr Lexell, its disco
erer, calculated it would return in fie
and a half years, but in 1775 telescopes
were ainly focused on the spot where
it was expected to reappear, ami again
in 1781 It disappointed all obserers
Mr Lexell plunged Into fresh calcula
tions and after much research found
that Jupiter was the culprit The un
fortunate comet had been rash enough
to plunge Into the sphere of the giant
planet's attraction, with the result that
It tiad been completely dierted from
its former, orbit and flung off into quite
a different one of a twenty year period
It has neer been seen again by any
one on this earth and probably neer
will be " '
Jupiter was also responsible for the
delay which occurred in the return of
that splendid isitant known as Hal
ley's comet Halley found that he was
not the first discoerer of this big com
et  It had appeared at least twice pre
iously, once seentyfie years before
and again seentysix years before that
The astronomer concluded that there
would be a further delay in its third
return and predicted that its next ap
pearance would be 518 days later Ho
did notlie to see lt^ But in 1758, th^
year he had prophesied for its reap
pearance, astronomers were waiting
for it

EUCATING OYSTERS
Training; Schools In Which the Bi
ulres Are Tn tight Some Sense
"A school for oysters," said a dealer
In fish, "Is an Institution that you
would swear could not exist, for oys'
tera are notorious for their stupidity
It is, howeer, a fact that there are
many oyster schools I will ' explain
them to you In such  way that you
will beliee in them An'oyster's intel
ligence is limited, but still It has intel
ligence Years ago certain wise fish
dealers discoered t'uii you take an
oyster suddenly from its subaqueous
bed it opens its shell, whereupon the
life glingwater inside it all escapes
and the oyster dies But if you ex
pose an oyster to the air ' gradually,
lifting it out of the water for a few
minutes and then returning it again, it
gradually learus that to keep its shell
closed when out of the water is the
best thing for Its health These inest
tigators found that they could take tw
oysters, one trtineil aud one untrained^'
and the trained oyster, keeping Its shell
closed while out of the water, would
lie a long time, while the untrained
one, opening its shell, would die in a
few hours Therefore training schools
for oysters were established The
schools are In appearance nothing more
than reseroirs full of water Oysters
are put in them, and the water is drain
ed off and then 'reiurned again It Is
kept off for a few minutes at first, then
for ten minutes, then for half an hour
and so on Oysters in these schools
learn that they will lie longest and
keep healthiest out of water If they
hold their shells tight shut As soon as
they learn this they are graduated and
go, out into the world" — Philadelphia

The Art of Listening
There is a grace of kind listening as
we'l as a grace of kind speaking Some
men listen with an abstracted air
which shows that their thoughts are
elsewhere, or they seem to listen, but
by wide answers and irreleant ques
tions show that they hae been occu
pied with their own thoughts as being
more interesting, at least In their own
estimation,  than what yon hae been
saying Some interrupt and will not
hear you to the end Some hear you to
the end, and forthwith begin to talk to
you about a similar experience which
has befallen themseles, making your
case only an illustration of their own
Some, meaning to be kind, listen with
such a determined, liely, iolent at
tention that you are at once made un
comfortable, and the charm of con
ersation is at an end Many persons
whose manners will stand the test of
speaking break down under the trial
of listening •

the officers put them on when they

and don ciilian dress to go to lunch

afternoon and departure for home

against Amador county arising out
of the appeal of the salary case to
the supreme court The district at
torney — the sworn counselor of all
county officials on all legal proposi
tions — was unceremoniously brushed
aside for the time being, and the ad
ice of the opposing counsel in a suit
instituted against Amador county
was taken, resulting in the passage
of the afore mentioned resolution of
intention to repudiate The resolu
tion was 'born out of due time" Tt
was neer intended for anything else
than a scarecrow It has proed a
miserable failure in this respect It
has scared no one All of our co
temporaries greeted the passage of
this estoppel resolution with an
thems of approal It was a master
piece of strategy, that promised to
unlock the doors of the county treas
ury to the salary grabbers without
further ado with the courts Neer
theless, the appeal side of the con
troersy went along as though
nothing had happened In the pro
ceedings of the board published in
this issue it will be noted that three
claims relating to the appeal of the
justice's salary case were allowed
One for typewriting amounting to
$30; another for printing the tran
script on appeal, amounting to $25;
the other for $10 for filing the tran
script in the supreme court These
claims were plainly endorsed, showing
their connection with the case on ap
peal This was done for the purpose
of guarding against any possibility
of their being allowed without know
ledge of their character These bills
were passed for payment, and en
dorsed by the chairman without a
word of commen^ They were pass
ed upon by the district attorney as
legal claims against the county, and
not a murmur of protest was raised
against their payment In thus act
ing the Ledger beliees the super
isors did the right thing It is
true, their act is sadly out»of unison
with the illjudged resolution passed
at their preious meeting But that
mistake they cannot now undo And
they hae done all tbat^hey are able
to do to rectify that blxmder by re
fusing to tread in the path they were
led to map out for themseles We
presume our cotemporaries will now
with one accord proceed to laud this
latest exhibition as another notable
example ot doing the right thing at
the right time They certainly ought
to be equally capable with the coun
ty managers in doing the change
about act
THE INTOLERABLE TURK
The insufferable Turk is the source
of more trouble and apprehension in
Europe than all other nations com
bined More than 500 years hae
elapsed since he first planted him
self upon the soil of Europe, and the
people today are not one whit more
reconciled to his presence than they
were at the beginning Like the
Chinese in America, there is no pos
sibility of any assimilation of the
Turk to the ways of the western
nations He belongs to the east and
not to the west His oriental in
stincts and methods hae clung to
him through the centuries of his
contact with western ciilization
He looks down upon other people
as Christian do^s, beliees he be
longs to a superior type of mankind
Assimiliation from his standpoint
means degradation — a step from the
higher to the lower plane He fast
ened himself upon Europe as a con
queror It is only natural that he
should look down upon the subju
gated people as his inferiors in
eery way The Turkish yoke has
neer been otherwise than galling
and oppressie to Europeans The
Turk is iudolent To earn his liing
by manual labor is not according to
his tastes or religion His ambition
i>> to lie in affluence at the expense
of others An army of tollgatherers
— legalized plunderers we might say
—is quartered upon the Christian
communities, and eat up the sub
stance of the inhabitants as com
pletely as a swarm of locusts re
duces a garden to a wilderness As
a result, reolts against Turkish
domination are frequent The desire
to throw off the yoke, and rid tbs
country of his hateful presence is
eer paramount The upshot of
almost eery internal or external
imbroglio has been to wipe off a
goodly strip of territory from the
map of European Turkey This pro
cess of attrition has earned for this
Musselman power the title of the
"sick man of* Europe" A fresh at
tack of sickness is now on in the in
surrections in Macedonia and Bul
garia These subject proinces are
utterly unable to cope unaided with
the military forces of the Sultan
They hae the sympathy of the
Christian world behind them in their
struggle for freedom ,The Turk
would hae been drien from Europe
generations ago were it not for the
jealousies of the great powers as to
the parceling out of the territory
among the other nations Een now
shorn and contracted as compared
with the fullness of its power, the
dominions of the Turk embrace some
of the fairest and most fertile sec
tions of Europe They are compara
tie deserts nowPersonal they would bloom
like garden spots under faorable
conditions Moreoer, the most
commanding position from a com
mercial and naal" iewpoint is the
seat of Turkish authority on the
Bosphorus, Constantinople Th»t
Turkey has maintained its foothold
in Europe so long is due to the dan
ger of upsetting the balance of pow
er in the distribution of these coet
ed points of antage rather than to
any consideration for the decaying
nation itself, It is eident, howeer,
that the issue must be met sooner
or later The Turk is out of his
element where he now is Western
ciilization demands that he retire
to his natie home in Asia, where
the people are less restie under his
despotic ways The finger of des
tiny seems to indicate th"at his re
tirement cannot be much longer de
layed  ""•'•'"' r"'"';^

The Prehistoric Goldfind
   —     r
There's a sometime whispered atory^
'Mongst our Indians, seldom told
To the white man or his children
Which concerns this land of gold
Long ago, so runs the legend,
When Sequoia's groes were young,
Came a people strangely singing
In a strange, unmeaning tongue
Seeing on the Indian's armlet,
Nuggets bright of wondrous size
Told they of their mighty chieftain
Wisest man of all the wise
Searched they on the snowcapped nmintain,
And the shining rier sand;
eled within the rock ribbed bosom,
Of the Indian's happy land
Found they gold in such abundance
That their backs bent 'neath its weight,
As they filed in long procession
Toward the sunset's golden gate
For King Solomon had sent them,
To his builder's gold to bring
That his temple might be worthy
Of his Lord, his God, his King
Back they toiled o'er wastes of water
Neer crossed by man' before
Safe at last, they heaped their treasure,
On the Galileean shore '
Wondering goldsmiths deftly wrought it,
In a eil most wondrous fair;
Hung it in that beauteous temple
Solomon's farfamed house of prajer
Een thus, at the crucifixion, V
California did her part
For that golden eil was rien
When they pierced our Saior's Heart

How Taxes Bun Up
As a sample of how taxes accumulate
on property that has been sold to the
state on account of delinquent taxes,
wo may mention that a property holder
this week appeared in Jackson for the
purpose of redeeming his holdings He
was unaware of the status of the mat
tor until his attention was called to it
by tho publication in the Ledger His
taxes for 1894 might hae been settled
for something oer $2 It cost him this
week, with penalties, interests and
other costs, oer $20 to get the title
clear on tho records in his own name
It is a great mistake for any property
holder to imagine that he can sae
money by allowing his property to be
sold and deeded to the state, under, the
impression that assessment of the prop
erty ceases after it passes to the state
State property cannot be legally assess
ed; but the penalties and costs on de
linquent property are so gauged that
no matter when tho original holder re
deems, it will cost him more than if he
had paid his taxes regularly eery
year as thej became duo Some who
hao beeu inquiring about redeeming
delinquent property this week are
amazed at the doubling up process, and
are almost inclined to let the state keep
tho property rather than put up the
sum necessary to redeem And there
aro hundreds of pieces of property in
Amador county today, the title ' of
which has passed to tho state, and a
good deal of it is good property, and
worth many times oer the price of
redemption 37 •&

appears that some unstamped brandy
was discoered on land ownod by on
dero, but which be had rented toother
parties The sum of $750 was offorod
by the parties implicated to sottlo tho
matter  The roonuo officials refused
to settle for that sum Later tho offer

this penalty will satisfy tho demands of

As the resignation of Superintendent
J B Riddick of tho Preston school at
lone is in the bands of tho directors, to
take effect ecember 3, a number of
applicants are springing up for the
lucratie berth It carries a salary of
$2500 per annum, with concomitant ad
antages, such as household supplies
and free dwolllng Tho candidates at
present prominontly mentioned for tho
position are Re August rahms,
chaplain of San Quentin prison, E Carl
Bank, who was the first superintendent
of the school, and whose regime was
unmarked by friction of any kind, and
E H Archer, who is at present sec
retary to the board of directors Bank
is now superintendent of tho Bcnecia
Agricultural Works, Tho directors
meet in San Francisco tomorrow, am
it is likely that Riddick 'a successor will
be selected at that meeting
The Wardenship of Folsora
According to the San Francisco
papers, the selection of a new warden
for the Folsom penitentiary has been
irtually settled, and on Noember 10,
when tho board of prison directors
meet to name tho successor to Warden
Wilkerson, the honor will fall to J M
Standley, exsheriff of Mendocino coun
ty In accordance with a timehonored
custom, the wisdom of which the Led
ger is unable to perceie, the wardens
of tho two state prison institutions are
selected from opposing political parties
Presumably this is dono to remoe
these positions out of the pale of politi
cal influence as much as possible But
all the same this claim is merely a sham
When a acancy occurs, it is the poli
ticians of both parties who bestir them
seles to get faorites appointed More
oer it is usually politicians — too often
of the backnumber ariety — who set
up a clamor for the fat berths Re
publicans are found pulling the wires
for the appointment of a democrat, and
ice ersa Now, when a republican
administration is on top, why two good'
republicans — men who hae been true
to the party in the ascendancy — cannot
be 'found to administer the affairs of
the prison, we hae neer been able to
find out To try to diide the respon
sibility by selecting men of differing
political beliefs is not apt to proe a
success It does not in fact remoe the
institutions from political influence any
more than a straightout policy Cer
tainly if the past history of the state
prisons is to be taken as a criterion, it
has accomplished nothing in the direc
tion of reform But so the fiat has
gone forth that one state prisou must
be managed by a republican and the
other by a democrat As Warden
Tompkins of San Quentin is a republi
can, tho warde'nship of Folsom is due
to a democrat When it became known
that Wilkerson had to retire, there
were a host of applicants for the place
It may not be generally known that
U S Gregory,  oxsheriff Of Amador
county, was mentioned for tho place
Finally the race narrowsd down to a
contest between U S Gregory of Ama
dor county, exsheriff J M Standloy
of Mendocino county, and"^ J; Fallon,
treasurer of Matin county  Gregory
was warmly championed by prison
director od Ray and for a time his
chances appeared promising Then,
despite the support of director Ray, he
was eliminated from tho race, apd Fal
lon and Standley remained
Each man was iewed, faorably by
the board of prison directors Finally,
howeer, the experience gained by
Standley as an official in handling
criminals threw the balance to his side,
and a majority of the board now faors
his candidacy \
To Apply for Pardon
 We hae receied a communication
from relaties of N A Macquarrle,
who is now confined in San Queotiu on
a coniction for forgery committed in
this county, saying that steps are being
taken to apply for a pardon Mac
quarrie is a ery sick man He is suf
fering from chronic pleurisy He has
submitted to three tappings already,
and it is ery doubtful if ho recoers
He is tho father of two bright childron
— a boy of eleen aud a girl of oight
years It is thought hard that these
young lies should bo clouded with the
disgrace of haing their father die in a
felon's cell Relaties are exerting
themseles with the iew of petitioning
goernor Pardee for his pardon It
will be remembered that Macquarrie
was conicted about 18 months ago of
issuing a spurious check and passing
the same upon a merchant in Jackson
for the sum of $50 He was sentenced
to seen years in San Quentin Under
the circumstances the Ledger would
heartily support any effort to secure
his release, not only on account of hia
failing health, and for tho sake of his
children, but also "because there exists
a strong feeling that he has sufficiently
expiated the crime of which he was
conicted
Funeral of V Gioannoni
Tho funeral of V Gioannoni, the

has been a prominent resident of Aina
dor county from early times, and his
interment gathered a large number
from all parts of the county, all desir
ous of paying the final tribute of re
spect to tho memory of one whom they
had so long and faorably known Ser
ices were conducted in the Catholic
church, the Re Father Gleason offici
ating Under a mass of floral offerings,
many of them of exquisite design and
workmanship, and all the kindly and
affectionate contributions to tho mem
ory of departed worth, the mortal re
mains were laid to rest in the Catholic

Accident at Kennedy
uring tho lunch hour on Monday, a
costly accident occurred at the south

and also containing a number of dinner
buckets belonging to tho minors The
result was that the skip went into the

cable with it Tho clutch was broken,
and other damage done Fortunately
the cable caught at the 1300 leel so
that fully onehalf of it will bo saed

mine Nothing has been done for two
or throemonths owing to lack of funds
Mr Horn is a caiful manager, and
adopts the wise policy of not attempt
ing to do any work unless he has the
money in sight to pay the employes
He expects that by extending the  tun
nol another 100 feet at furthest, the ore
body disclosed by tho shaft aboe will
be reached
New Method of Working /Tail
ings — E J Harrah and H H Harrah
of Oakland, of tho firm of E H Har
rah & Co, hae been in Suttor Creek,
Amador county, this week, making ar
rangements for the working of a large
body of tailings on the dump at the
chlorine plant They hae purchased
the 25,000 tons as well as tanks for the
working, and will commence operations
ery soon, somewhat on the principle
of cyaniding, although entirely a new
process of their own The Messrs
Harrah are at present engaged in plac
ing the large tanks and putting in nec
essary machinery Preious attempts
hae been made to work these tailings,
but each was a failure — Call
Sand Pile Mine— The big cyanide
plant for the treatment of the immense
accumulation of sand and tailings at
this property, near Forest Home, in
this county, is nearing completion
This plant is the first attempt on a
large scale to introduce tho cyanide
system in the extraction of gold from
slimes and fine sulphurets, the es
capes in this case from the Plymouth
mills, into this county The outcome
of the enture is awaited with consider
able interest It is said that before
the present extensie plant was start
ed, a practical test on a small scale was
made, with satisfactory results Tho
plant now nearing completion is ex
pected to start up ;boui the middle of
this month It consists of six large
ats, each of the capacity of 240 tons
The auriferous' bearing sand will be
subject to the action of the dissoling
fluid for seeral days, but tho output is
calculated at 240 tons per day The
works hae been constructed at a cost
of between $30,000 and $40,000 The
contract for the deliery of 240 tons of
sand, to the cars has been awarded to a
Plymouth man at 10 cents per ton — or
$24 per day It is estimated that the
accumulation of sand to be treated is in
the neighborhood of three million tons,
sufficient to keep the works running to
their full capacity for twenty years
From careful assays, the tailings are
said to carry at least one dollar per ton
in gold If 40 per pent of this' alue
can be saed, there is a good margin of
profit in the enterprise When in full
running order the plant will gie em
ployment to about 20 men

A Noel Proceeding
A curious incident that does not ap
pear in the official minutes of the super
isors, occurred last Monday The
bills for expenses incurred in the appeal
of the justice's salary case were all al
lowed, and signed by the chairman in
open session But after the board, had
adjourned, it seems that the matter
was the subject of  discussion in the
clork's office, as though these claims
were approed without knowing their
import The upshot was that one of
the bills— the claim for printing the
transcript— was marked by a load pen
cil being drawn oer the indorsement
of approal Whether this was in
tended to withdraw the approal of
the claim we do not know It cortaln
ly did not hae that effect The act of
approing a claim can only be rescinded
by the action of the board in official
session Howeer, the pencil mark
had the offect of causing tho treasurer
to withhold payment until the matter
was explained The claim was paid on
Wednesday, the pencil score notwith
standing

rawing Their Fees
The hollowness of the contention
made by the justices and constables,
that they could not, owing to the
attitude of the auditor, draw any com
pensation for their serices in criminal
cases, either under the old or the new
law, until the' final determination of
the suit now pending by the supreme
court, is fully, 'shown by a perusal of
the proceedings of the board of super
isors published in this issue It will
be seen that some justices and con
stables were allowed their fees No
doubt all would hae been allowed their
just claims under the fee law had they
sent in their claims • It is noticeable
that those who hae been the loudest
in denouncing the appeal of the case;
are not in the list of bills allowed
Neither are those who figure as peti
tioners in the /mandamus proceedings
It would, seem incongruous
for them as indiiduals to put in a de
mand for fees while they are actually
suing for salary Viewed in the light
of a friendly suit for the purpose of
testing the constitutionality of the sal
ary law, we can see' nothing inconsist
ent in accepting fees, pending the final
outcome It may be, after the hue and
cry that ' has been made, after the
strenuous efforts that hae been made
to block the appeal proceedings, a re
treat at this juncture would appear
strange At any rate, the plea that
they were asked to sere without pay
has been exploded by the unanswer
able logic of facts

THE LARGER FOOT
Bee If This Shoe Salesman* Theory
Fits Yonr Case
"The question of which foot to fit
first is an important one to us," said th
"shoe salesman "It may seem strange to
you, but it is rarely that we do not ex
perience some trouble In fitting one
foot while the other is easily coered
A popular belieStobtains that the left
foot of eery person is the hardest to
fit, ;nd consequently many shoe clerks
always try a shoe on that foot first It
Is not true, howeer, according to my
obseration, that there is any inflexible
rule as to which foot to try first It ia
true, neertheless, that In a majority
of cases if you succeed in fitting the left
foot you will hae no trouble with tho
right My practice is to try both feet
before I pronounce a pair of shoes a
perfect fit Then lam sure of aoiding
any mistake growing out of peculiar
ities of foot formation No two per
sons hae feet formed exactly alike,
and the shoe salesman who thinks so
anil is goerned accordingly will meet
with many complaints
"For some time I pondered oer the
problem of fitting shoes to feet, and es
pecially as to why the left foot should
be considered tjje standard by which
to be goerned  The only rational the
ory I hae eer been able to eole is
a ery simple one when you come to
consider lt_ Nine out of ten persons
you meet are tight handed, as we say
About one person In ten, or perhaps the
per cent is een less than that, uses his
left hand If you will obsere persons
who use the right hand when they are
standing and talking they Inariably
rest their weight on the left foot And,
ice ersa, a left handed person will
rest his or her weight on the right foot
The result is that" with right handed
persons the left foot is probably a frac
tion larger than the right foot, and the
shoe clerk must ineitably find this to
be a fact sooner or later" — New Or

ROMANCE IN VARIE QUISE
efinition of the Word Is Susceptible
of Wide iersification
What Is romance? Een the collo
quial use of the term is aried When
we say "you are romancing" or call
anything romantic as distinguished
from what Is real or what is true we
mean one thing, but quite another
when we apply the term romantic to
natural scenery And ln this applica
tion we must distinguish between the
effect upon us of that which we call
romantic because of human associa
tions with certain sights or sounds and
that wlldness of nature which we call
romantic because of its absolute dis
sociation from anything human
Keeping out of mind the use of the
word ln artistic and literary criticism,
let us try to find what element of
reconcilement there is in the diersities
of colloquial usage
In all that Is generally called ro
mantic ln the cases aboe mentioned
there Is the common element of
strangeness We easily reert to what
must hae been the original  sense of
the word in its connection with those
mediaeal modifications of the Latin
tongue known as the romance lan
guages The Saxon or Celt would
hae found his natie tongue sufficient
for all ordinary needs, but If he
caught the Roman air ln any way, by
trael or refinement of taste and habit,
he would, to meet the newly deeloped
need, borrow the graces of the Roman
speech — that Is, he would romance —

EMERSON'S PROSESTYLE
Held to Be Lacking In the Quality
of Writers Called Masters
What shall be said of Emerson's
prose? Was Matthew Arnold right
when, as an experienced critic calmly
judging the faorite author of  hla
youth, he denied that the "Essays,"
the lectures and "English Traits" form
ed a body of prose of sufficient merit
to entitle Emerson to be ranked as a
great man of letters? It seems as if
the time had come for Emerson's coun
trymen frankly to accept this erdict
Because of deficiencies, both of style
and of romance, Emerson* does not
belong to the small class of the great
mnsters of prose His style, despite
the fact that "Nature" and many of
the essays contain pages of eloquent
prose almost equal in power and bean
ty to noble poetry waj pearly always
that of the lecturer or pfeacliSf ratter
than that of the writer He too fre
quently lost the note of distinction and
was content if he satisfied his far from
exigent audiences In diction, to be
sure, he was a conscious' and consum
mate" master, and it need scarcely be
said that few writers hae surpassed
him in the ability to compose a preg
nant sentence But, as is generally ad
mitted and as is shown by his prac
tice of piecing his notes together, he
was rarely able to eole a paragraph,
much more a whole essay, in a mas
terly or een ln a workmanlike fashion
It may be granted that critics hae
oeremphasized his lack of coherence,
that there Is more logical unity in his
essays than appears on first reading,
that "English Traits" and the later
olumes are far from being mere
strings of "orphlc sayings," but the
fact seems to remain that the prose
style of Emerson from first to last
lacks the firmness, the compass, the
precision, the flexibility, tlfe indiid
uality we demand of the prose writers
whom we denominate masters — Pro
fessor Trent in Bookman
MIGHTY TREES OF SIERRA

to the same company as Shakespeare

London to ' Norwich, a distance of 114
miles He was accompanied by a ser
ant, an umpire and a man with a tabor
and pipe Crowds hindered his start
on Feb 11, 1600, and many met him at
eery place Seeral tried to dance
with him, but none could rial his pace
The most successful were w,omen ' Al
though! delayed by a snowstorm, he did
itjn nine days, and on the way accept
ed "a challenge or two, each time com
ing off best, except when a Chelmsford

wrote an account of it, which ends
with a warning to those with whom he
