target shoot at that place, shooting at
a Columbia target, 200 yards, with a
rifle off band, he made a score of nine
points in a possible of five. On" the
Columbia target the center shot,
which must be within a one-inch circle,
counts one, immediately without that
circle, two, and so on, the shooter
■ having live shots. Foreman's shooting

Hallway Development in Africa.
In twenty years' time, it . is safe to
prophesy, railroad development in
Africa will have made enormous strides
— and the many important branch
lines to connect with, the Cape-Cairo

line from Johannesburg will have

running right across the country " to

In Central Africa, the trunk line will
connect with German and British lines
running to the east coast; and it is
only reasonable to suppose that by that

FUTURE OF OLD IRONSIDES
Recollections of the Frigate,
Constitution.
HER ill AND RIGGING LIKELY TO BE REPAIRED
It May Be Yean Before This Histor
ical TuVWill Be Ready For
, Active Service Again.
The President's approval on Febru
ary 14th of the act "authorizing the
Secretary of the Navy to place the
frigate Constitution' in the same con
dition as regards 'her bull and rigging
as she waa when in ' active' service,'" re
calls among naval officers many inter
esting reminiscences of the more re
cent career of the famous Old Iron
bides, which had been almost forgotten
in the rapid development of the new
steel navy. It is not generally known,
for example, that scarcely a ' stick of
timber from the original conqueror of
the Gue.riere now exists, save a few
decayed ribs and frames, so often has
the old hull been restored and exten
sively repaired, and, in fact, when the
provisions of the new law are carried
out the Constitution will be practically
a new ship.
The Navy Department has been an
ticipating for several years securing
authority for rehabilitating the Con
stitution for use as a naval museum, to
be stationed preferably at Washington,
and with that end in "view has careful
ly saved large quantities, of well sea
soned live oak timber, and "knees" in
the shiphouse at the Boston Navy
Yard, all the ship timber 'at other
naval stations having been : bold in the
last decade as j worthless for the new
steel vessels. The Chief Constructor
says he has accumulated sufficient ma
terial in this manner to rebuild the
ship, and, therefore, all the money
mado available may be expended for
labor. The new law involves the gov
ernment in no expense, as the Massa
chusetts State Society of United States
Daughters of 1812 has undertaken to
raise all the funds required, and under
the provisions of the act work' is not to
be begun until the money is raised by
popular subscription.
The early history of the famous old
craft, especially of her fighting days,
is familiar to the public, but since she
was placed on the retired list, just be
fore the Civil War, other vessels have
crowded her out of the public mind,
just as the Oregon and Olyinpia and
Gloucester have more recently diverted
attention from the earlier ships of the
White Squadron. Nearly thirty years
ago, when . patriotic ingenuity was
taxed in preparation for the Centennial
celebration of the Declaration- of In
dependence, the dismantled hulk of
the old frigate was rotting away in
neglect on the mud flats of the Phila
delphia Navy Yard, where in 1875 the
present Chief Constructor of the Navy
was ordered to restore her to her origi
nal condition for the Exposition. What
was left of her' was hauled oui> on dry
land, all rotten planking and other
timber was torn off and thrown away,
until a bare semblance of the keel and
ribs remained. •
Just at this time, to provide railway
room for trains which were expected to
carry the vast crowds in and out of
Philadelphia, the old navy yard was
sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad,
which immediately took possession,
and assisted the navy to transfer its
movable ' plant promptly to j League
Island, which was given to the govern
ment. The remains of- the Constitu
tion were in no condition to be moved
except by piecemeal, so a high board
fence was built' close to her, and inside
of this, under the most trying circum
stances, she was rebuilt and finally
launched. During the Exposition she
was anchored in midstream, and was
visited by thousands, who whittled her
woodwork and carried away tons of
splinters from her, under the mistaken
notion that they were getting souven
irs of the original ship. Constructor
Hichborn says that the hull at that
time was wholly replanked and fasten
ed with irou bolts at a cost of about
$150,000, and everything In sight was
brand new.
The work was so well done that when
it was proposed to send the vessel to
the Paris Exposition of 1878 as a trans
port for United States national ex
hibits an Inspection board pronounced
her as seaworthy as any vessel in the
service. To get her exhibits Into her
hold it was necessary to cut out her
deck and enlarge her hatches, so she
could carry streetcars and other large
articles. Under the command of Cap
tain Oscar Badger she reached Havre
without extraordinary difficulties, it
being considered that American men-of
warsmen of that time were not famil
iar with navigating vessels dependent
upon sail power alone, but Qn her. re
turn she had an exciting cruise, and
was the subject of constant national
anxiety. Almost at the outset she
"piled up" bows on, on the shores of
Ireland, and only got afloat again after
much ingenuity and labor had been
expended. ' The drubbing she had on
the rocks at that time proved how
thoroughly she had been repaired.
„ Her release was only effected by the
concerted efforts of a number of tugs
hitched to her stern, acting in con
junction w|th an unusually high tide,
From the Irish coast sho ran into a
heavy storm, which carried away her
rudder, and just about the time she
was expected at New York the Navy
Department was astonished to receive
the announcement of her arrival at
Gibraltar." Here she was repaired, and
started safely for the United States.
She " reached ' home finally by "way of
Cape Verd and the West Indies, and
after discharging her cargo, was sent
to Portsmouth, N.H.y to be housed
over, at a cost of $30,000, until she re
sembled Noah's Ark fitted as a receiv
ing ship at that navy yard.' "There
Old Ironsides remained until she was
towed down to Boston to celebrate the ;
centenary of her own" launching oS
October 21, 1897, when one of the
powder boys who served on her in 1812
was present. Since that time the ship
has been idle at the Boston Navy Yard.
Naval officers do not think the popu
lar subsc iption jof the old vessel will
be completed for several years, and,' as
they are prevented under . the law from
starting the. work until all the money
needed is paid in, they do not expect to
have the Constitution ready for 6ea be
fore 1910, at the earliest.— New York
Tribune. .■'-. ■■-■--■:-■■ ..

and Second Assistant Police Prosecu
tor Binsmade and witnesses, defend
ants and complainants . mut>t confine
themselves, to English "as she is
spoke" when giving testimony., Bar
ney O'Brien was placed on trial in the
Police Court today on the charge of
assault and battery. The charge was
preferred by Dominick O'Malley, who
accused O'Brien of having broken his
jaw with a pitchfork. - : O'Malley said:
"I worked for O'Brien, and on Febru
ary 11th ho told me to bed the babies."
"Slang ' phrases don't go in this
Court, interrupted Judge Fielder.
"Well, he" meant' that I should bod
the horses," said the witness in ex
planation. "I ' would not bed the
horses," resumed the witness. "I told
O'Brien that was his job, and then we
chewed the rag." ;. ■
"What kind of a rag?" asked
Brinsmade. ■'
"Then O'Brien cracked me over the
block. "continued O'Malley.
"Over what?" said the Judge.
"Over the block. I mean my head,"
said O'Malley. ' : '
"Then I picked, up my lid." contin
ued the witness. c . :\: \
"Now stop," said . Brinsmade.
"What is a lid?"
"I picks up my hat," said O'Malley.
"and does the get-away act, when—"
"For the love of Providence, cut
that out." yelled .Brinsmade. Then,
correcting himself, he said: "I mean
stop using that kind of language in
this Court."
. I These episodes were repeated several
times, and then it was decided to con
tinue the case.
A peculiar coincidence in connection
with the Judge's ruling that no slang
is to be permitted to be used is that he
had a few moments before the case was
placed on trial declared that two at

OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
Their Relation as Generally
Understood.
!. L. KIP PREStfITS AN IMPRESSIVE ARGUMENT
He Says the Practical Theorist Makes
the Feat Time and Is the Sure
est of His Kesults.
Theory and •practice 'are quite com
monly set at opposite poles. ' They
seem to be regarded as occupying a
sort of an east and west; relation to
each other, and not being on speaking
terms, and that whatever one rhay.be
the other is not. :' Now,' this is a very
erroneous j idea.' - In all wise, safe con
duct theory underlies practice. A rail
road time table, a physician's prescrip
tion, an architect's plan, are all theo
ries. All action that implies a volun
tary and conscious agent is the ex
pression of plan. It is the practical
theorist who makes the best time and
the surest getting there. : There is
truth in the old couplet, .'.'A good rule
is a .'good tool." And the emphasis
rests. on the adjective. In rules or
tools we want those that will work! -
It just aoout makes all the difference
we observe in people as to success in
life whether they are practical theo
rists or mere idealists, whose heads
buzz with chimerical notions. Some
people wonder why they do not got
along better, ; and at the same time
those who are familar with their
modes and methods , wonder how they
get along at all. It is not because they
are not industrious, not necessarily be
cause they are extravagant, nor that
they lack equipment and facility.
Their heads may be good enough, but
they fail to gear them to their work:
Rules and plans are largely at the dis
cretion of the individual, who, if he
has discretion, can make them sub
servient to his interests. Their appli
cation he must tind out for himself.
Sometimes the exception is better than
the rule. Circumstances alter cases.
A horse is a. horse. Yet when a man
buys be selects in accordance with his
purpose. He does not get for the coal
wagon or the plow what he would take
for the boulevard or the track. A
farm is a farm.' Yet if the farmer ex
pects to pay off his mortgage and
mako a home for bis old age, he must
discriminate in his methods . between
upland and lowland, clay and sand.
All farms may not be worked just
alike. A certain young Englishman
went to Australia many years ago, and
in the course of a few years succeeded
in establishing himself comfortably
and securely on a moderate tract of
land. But after a while he became am
bitious to be master of a vast estate.
So he sold his pleasant and secure do
main, and took up a great block in a
distant section. It required all his
capital to make the ' new start, and by
the timo it was stocked and fitted up
with needful improvements he had
rolled up a large burden of debt, and
he soon found his theory in practical
realization ' very different from his
dreams- There were contingencies he
had not counted on. By and by, when
his resources were expended and his
credit stretched to its extreme limits,
just as he hopt.d to reimburse his
large and long outlay by the sale of
stock, the country was visited by a
terrible devastating drouth. Vegeta
tion withered, streams dried up, sheep
and cattle and horses died, and the
banks foreclosed their ; mortgage and
sold him out. He was still young and
energetic and took bold anew. He
worked as a day laborer and watched
every possible opportunity to retrieve
his losses, and was in condition some
years afterward to buy back the place
which" he had at the dictate of his
wild ambition abandoned.
Glitter is not always gold, as many a
one who has been attracted by spark
ling invitations has ascertained to his
sorrow. It is well for every one to
hold the helm of his course well in
band, and know just where he is steer
ing. There may bo a. time when, as
Napoleon said, "Rashness is prudence;"
but as a rule discretion is the : better
part of valor. Conditions of success
remain about the same from" year to
year, and century to century." The
hill s difficulty has never been graded
very low. The labor saving machinery
or improved ' equipment - will separate
thriving "and .driving.': Perseverance
and ' perspiration will be as indispen
sable in 1900 as 1800. Air castles will
be no more likely to materialize in the
future than in the past, and our
chances of success will always be in
to-day rather than in to-morrow. Our
fortunes are no more likely to be built
by fortuitons circumstances than a
cartload of bricks to resolve them
selves into a house, and we are sure to
find pluck a more practical theory than
luck.— lsaac L. Kip.

CHINESE IRRIGATION.
Although Their Methods Are- Crude, the
Chinese Are Expert Gardners.
The vast Chinese population knows
nothing about irrigation systems in
the modern sense: the Chinese are
ignorant as to centrifugal pumps and
yet with their crude methods they are
expert ivrigatore and get all there is
out of lands kept fertile by the con
stant use of water.
The Grand canal between the Yang
tsze-Kiang and the old bed of the Yel
low river in China carries a vast vol
ume of water which is used largely for
irrigation, the Chinamen laying off
their little farms in plats and terraces,
raising long-grained rice and curious
Chinese vegetables, and utilizing every
inch of space.
In some of the provinces of the great
Celestial Empire where the rivers are
subject to spring floods, to protect
themselves from inundation, the na
tives have thrown up embankments or
levees on both sides of the rivers, but
at distances of 100 or 150 feet from the
natural banks. . This intervening space
is, of course, flooded yearly and by the
action of the water a now layer of rich
soil is deposited upon it with the reced
ing of the water. On this space the
natives immediately proceed to plant,
the flood danger being post for the
year and the moist and enriched ground
insuring a heavy yield of the peculiar
crops grown by the Chinese farmers,
y One of the most wonderful features
in the physical geograpy - of China Is
the e*«te.ftcs of av^ region qf lqeaa
in ; the northern portion of the Em
pire, and constituting, an area of 250,
000 square miles.
Loess is a solid but friable earth,
brownish yellow . in color, which is
found in somo sections 1000 feet deep.
It has a tendency to vertical cleavage
and wherever a river has cut into it,
the loess encloses the stream between
perpendicular cliffs, in many places 500
feet high. ! The loess is of great value
to tho inhabitants -; of northern China.
In the sides .' of its 'perpendicuiar cliffs
are dug, out thousands of caves in
in which a large majority of the people
inhabiting the loess region | live. . Its
surface is t very fertile and under the
careful Chinese irrigation yields abun
dant "crops." "Upon the application of
water it assumes, an intensely yellow
color, : varying from brown to orange,
and the deep sides of the little irriga
tion ditches assume almost the brill
iant colors of the sunset. -■ ■: ■ '; _ . ; . . .. ■ . L
URGE | RECLAMATION.
.The advisability and public necessity
for the building of 'storage reservoirs
to save the millions of dollars, now an
nually going to waste in the form of
water, should be impressed upon the
attention of Congress by all -the in
fluence and argument that can be
brought to bear now, - and constantly
until something is accomplished along
this line. No representative should be
sent to the .House or the Senate from
a Westorn State who is not pledged
to support this measure for boundless
western development. .
A - DANGEROUS PROPOSITION.
State cesscession of government land,
and arid I land-reclamation are incom

that they may reclaim them, says an
able advocate of state cession. How

Senator Qallinger, who is a member of the Commit
tee on Porto Rico, in a recent speech advocating the 15 per
-cent; duty on Porto Rican products other than coffee,* which,
by the way, constitutes four-fifths of the island's exports,
made a ringing center. shot. He said: - "We are proposing
"to treat Porto Rico better than we treat" any territory of the
- -<U. S.;.We collect internal revenue taxes in Oklahoma, New
Mexico, Indian Territory and Arizona, and every dollar of it
goes into the, U. S. Treasury^ We shall collect internal rev
enue taxes in Porto Rico, too, but every dollar so collected
_ will be returned to the Porto Ricans and be used for their
beriefit?'T" Of the connection of trusts wilh the question and
: . their alleged control of republican policy, Mr. Gallinger said:
."We heard .the same when Hawaii was annexed and free
entry to our ports was ; given Hawaiian sugar. Now it is
raised again when we propose to place a small duty upon the
products of Porto Rico, for the benefit of the Porto Ricans
themsetlves. The trust which is suffering, the trust which
we are oppressing by this legislation is composed of some
gentlemen at the Arlingtou Hotel in this city — a trust
headed by the British Vice-Consul at San Juan. That trust
is suffering considerably. Those gentlemen bought up the
sugar under the full Dingley rates, and if they can get it
into this country free of duty, they will make the full 100%
of the tariff; but if we succeed in putting a tariff duty of
15% of the Dingley rate on that sugar, the trust's profits
, will be cut down by that much, and the people of Porto Rico
will benefit to that extent." v

to several applicants to dredge the ocean bed from the line of

PUBLIC APPEAL 7
Aid From the Whole State Bought In the
Palo Alto Chinese Case.
. It is a mutter of. common -knowledge
that the Statn;«tf has long
been disgraced by the slavery of Chi
nese girls. The fact that this tratlio is
confined to Chiuese hubjects does not
mitigate the [ offense against- law and
decency or loss-on tho moral responsi
bility of the citizens of the State. It
is also a matter of common knowledge
that this traffic could not continue
were it not for the connivance or assist
ance of unscrupulous attorneys and offi
cers of the law. That the people of
the State have not ' hitherto crushed
out this traffic is a disgrace.
The recent case of Kirn Quey is an
aggravated one. Rescued from a
Chinese den in San Francisco by the
Presbyterian Chinese Home, the girl
was arrested last Thursday evening on
a warrant issued by Justice Dyer of
Palo Alto on a charge of petit larceny.
Miss Cameron, superintendent of the
bom*?, accompanied the prisoner •to
Palo Alto. She dwlined to leave the
girl, hoping to gain charge of her after
her trial. In consequence, she was
lodged in jail with her.
. At 2 a. m. despite ' the pleadings and
protests of Miss Cameron, who had
barricaded the jail door, two deputy
constables with a pick -ax forced their
way in. After a struggle the prisoner
was forced from Miss Cameron and
driven off in a waiting buggy by
one of the conslables. Tho Justice of
-the Peace and tho two Chinese prose
cutors mot tho constable and, his priso
ner on thtS-'eounty road. There and
then, about half past two o'clock a. m.,'
court was held.! Ono of the Chinese,
acting as interpreter, plead "guilty"
for the prisonor, and. the other paid
the fine, and the girfam her discharge
was taken away by the two Chinamen.
Such cases have hitherto been diffi
cult to deal with on account of tho
shrewdness of the offenders. Perjury
is common and money is freely usod.
Tho case at Palo Alto seoms to furnish
an opportunity to test the methods
used by those engaged in, such prac
tices. : The District Attorney of the
county of Santa Clara has the matter
in hand. Money is Deeded to employ
associate counsel. A considerable
amount has been raised here. =»But the
honor and interests of the whole Stato
are involved. We appeal to the people
of the State for financial aid to probe
this matter to the bottom.

DAILEY -STOCK COMPANY.
THE theatre going public of Jackson will be pleased to learn of the coming
engagement of the Dailoy Stock Company supporting Miss May Nannary.
They will appear hero next Monday and Tuesday, presenting on their
opening night the well known and successful play of Clay M. Green's, the
"New South." It is a beautiful story of the South in the reconstruction days
and involves the love trials of a gallant Northern army officer who is in love
with a pretty Southern girl. She reciprocates his affection for which she is
ostracized from society. Miss Nannary will assume the role of the Southern
girl who is also a.daughter of an ex-confederate General.
The company who are supporting Miss Nannary embrace such well known
people as Stanley Ross, W. R. Dailey, Louis Belmour, Pryce Mackaye, W. D.
Mitchell, Theodore Holzhausen, an eccentric German comedian, P. D. McGinn,
Ed. F. Nannary, Alfred Aldridge, Mrs. Louis Belmour, Olive Madison, Virginia
Cranna, Margaret Lewis and little Nessle Lewis.
The presentation on Tuesday evening will be Gillette's great military play
"Held by the Knemy."
Seats are now on sale at Kerr's Drug Store for both performances. The
price of seats during the Dailey engagment will be fifty and seventy-five cents.
When the reputation and ability of Dailey's players become known it will be
an assured fact that the hall iv which they are to appear will be crowded.

Peerless— Jackson.
Work at the Peerless mine is going

probably be let at this mine to sink 100
feet; and if that plan is satisfactory,
the'rest of the sinking will be done by
contract.

CALAVERAS COUNTY-
.Citizen: A meeting of the stock
holders of the Ford Mining- Company
was held on Saturday. A majority of
stock was represented, E. J. Solinsky
presiding and'H. L. Guerne acting as
secretary. The following, board of di
rectors was ' elected: F. J. Solinsky,
John Raggio, Carl Jaeger, G. G.
Fraser and C. L". Feusler. Subsequent
ly this board elected the : following ofli
cera: President, F. J. Solinsky; Sec
retary, Carl Jaeger; Treasurer, John
Raggio. The : condition of the mine
and its future development were fully
discussed. -Mr. Gutmann' advocated
the putting in of' an electric pumping
plant, sinking the shaft to the depth
of 1000 feet and then drifting south
wardly toward the Moro property.
The plan was favorably considered by
the stockholders and the directors were
authorized to do so, the cost not to ex
ceed $30,000.
The Ford was shutdown on Wednes
day and may be idle for a few days.
This is due to the breaking of the
shaft on the drum, which does not
mean a very costly repair, but a con
siderable delay in the work, 'which will
probably bring the water up to the
400-foot level.' On this level drifting is
continued, and southwardly, a harder
•and more promising rock ! has been en
countered. The prospects are.' better
than ever in the mine. '
f The Board of Directors of the Light
ner Mining Company decided at a
meeting held in Stockton last Monday
evening to issue 10,000 more 'shares of
stock, to be offered to the present
shareholders . pro rata at $]'per share.
* The sale is to be made to replenish the
company's treasury, . which is rather
low owing to delays and the cost of
maintaining some of the miners recent
ly hurt in the cave in the underground
works. It is said that the cost of the
accident is heavier than the manage
ment had counted -on and a sale of
stock or the levying of an asssessment
has become necessary. This stock is
sue will make the total number 'of
shares sold 100,000, leaving but 25,000
reserved for emergencfes.
: ' Record: The Union Copper ; mine is
now putting in a new skip way, and will
hereafter use skips instead of buckets,
as heretofore. They will put new ma
chinery all through the mine.
' On Friday of last week the San Jus to
' mine changed superintendents, M. D.
Ho wells retiring and his place being
taken by a man named Holmes, from
Siskiyou county. The mine is now
closed and will remain so until about
■ the sth of April. Considerable work
I in the way of track laying in the tunnel
is being done, as well as drifting in the
south side. Good rock is being found
■ there. •" . .
One of the most promising mines of
the mother lode is the Oriole, formerly
known as the Harris mine. It is situ
ated about two miles below, here and
' from present indications it will soon be
IP one of the big bullion producers of this
State. At present the shaft is down
over 400 feet, and will be made 450 in
. a short time. Two crosscuts have
been made, one at the 130 and one at
230 level; when the shaft reaches 450
feet crosscutting will be vigorously car
ried on. Tne formation of the walls is
slate, and at the 400-foot level a ledge
from sixty to eighty feet wide has been
■ found, which carries fine gold and sul
phurets, while the whole ledge is min
erallized; the rock is very much like
that of the famous Rawhide,' the strat
ification being quartz, meralic, - slate
and tale, and U very easily worked.
The gallows frame, which is forty feet
high, is built for a 2000 feet depth, the
engino'used for hoisting is a double
cylinder, seventy-horse ■ power, from
theAltaville Foundry. The mill will
be of ten stamps, which will soon be in-
creased to twenty. They now em
ploy sixteen men, working three shifts.
The superintendent, Mr. Heard, is well
known as ope of the most successful
men in his line, and is getting the best
possible results from the mine. The
reputation of the Oriole among mining
men is that of the best, and all declare
it will soon show that- the confidence of
the owners has not been misplaced in
regard to its richness.
The Rhode Island Mining Company
of Groveland, Tuolumne county, is
now about shut down, waiting for the
courts to settle the question of its
title, and the miners there are all out
of work in the meantime. About
thirty-four years ago a man named
Reed located on this ground, and dur
ing all these years did his assessment
work so as to keep his title clear. But
80 me years ago when Groveland was
granted a townsite this land was sold
to a man named Murray by the County
Judge, but neither Reed nor Murray
knowing of the other's claim. At last
Murray died, and his wife now sets up
her claim, showing as evidence the
original deed from the county judge
and a big bundle of tax receipts, which
show that the lot was regularly assess
ed to her and her predecessor in inter
est, and that the taxes were all paid.
The suit will be interesting, as in this
mining region there are many other
lota in the same condition.
Echo: The Utica ditch broke last
Thursday, and for several hours the
Utica mine ceased operations in con
sequence.
Prospect: The Rocky Bluff Mining
Company is, I am pleased to say, male
ing <joo<l progress after a long delay,
caused li.r the inability to procure the
uecessa>y material, etc.. with which to
proceed. They>nvo .now, a. twenty
fouWoot. wheel ilmost" completed and
will put in a ex or oi^lit-inch pump,
which, it is • thought, will be large
enough to contend with any body of
water which they are likely to strike.
.To start with, they have: an incline of
about seventy-five , feet, and /..calculate
that 100 feet more will strike bed rock.
Judging: from indications in the past
there is scarcely | any doubt but that I
will be able to send you some flattering
reports on this proposition before
months are past.
Messrs. Thomas & Dunston. are at
work on the Central Hill mine. They

Tho :machinery of the Esmeralda
mine at the Esmeralda, has been taken

Valley Spring, and thence shipped to
San Francisco. ! The mill was too lig-ht

resumed another mill would have to be
substituted. One of the horses engag
ed in the work was taken sick here
Monday night and : the team was
was obliged to lay over for a day.
TUOLUMNE COUNTY.
Mother Lode: The recent strike in
the Grizzly mine is having an enliven-,
tug effect upon adjacent properties and
has sent its stock up several points.
The owners of the Bonita, the next
claim tin .the, south, and the New Al
bany', which lies to the east, are bestir-,
ring themselves, and it is probable
that work will commence on both prop
erties soon. The new lodge in the
drizzly is said to be ten feet wide and
liberally specked with- free gold. It
was. found on the 700-foot level, and
guarantees the permanency of the
mine. V.- : '
County Surveyor Hopper has been
engaged this week in the survey of the
Providence mine. The mill is closed
down for tLe present and the shaft will
be pushed down from the 700 level. A
few men have been laid off in tbe
slopes.
The new drainage tunnel of the Dead
Horse mine will bo a big piece of work.
It will start from the river level on the
other side, and will drain the deepest
workings of the' mine.
Independent: Gold in big chunks is
coining out of the Hope, Sam Ualston's
bonanza. The strike was made last
Wednesday evening in the extreme
breast of the main tunnel which is 575
feot long. . The vein where the pay
chute was tapped showed twenty inches
of quartz. All Thursday the fine parr
tides of ore— sweepings — paid $20 a pan.
The pocket will run away up into the
thousands. -?■.. "i;;>

vated trains,' her tough conductors,
her freak newspapers, and her vulgar
theater swindles are described by Jer
ome A. Hart in a letter to the Argo
naut for - April -9, 1900. Nuisances
which seem almost unbearable to visit
ors are borne : uncomplaingly by the
people of the metropolis, and some of
the reasons for this are pointed out.
Mr. Gotlieb Woehrle and Miss Anna
Schmidt, prominent Germans of Jack
son, were united in marriage Wednes
day, AprU 4, 1900, at the M. E.
church, the ceremony being performed
by the pastor, Rev. F.A.Morrow. Mr.
and Mrs. Woehrle will visit San Fran
cisco, Monterey and other places of
note during their bridal tour. The
best wishes of many friends, for a pleas
ant trip and safe return go with them.
Mrs. James F." Allen, of Amador
City, sister of Miss Lucy.Hinkson.of
the New National, accompanied by
Mrs. Herbert Roberts, of Santa Bar
bara, visited the county seat Wednes
day. Mrs. Allen brought with ■ her a
large bouquet of roses, lilacs and other
beautiful varieties, for.. which Amador
is noted, and presented j them to Miss
Hinkson, who, in turn, presented -them
to the guests of tho New National by
beautifying the dining-room with them.

worn on the night of tho ball, but I
cannot, of course, divulge the secret.
The proceeds are to be donated to the

Miss Stella Cranna, of San Francisco,
is visiting Miss Ella Clute. . Her sister,
Miss Virginia Cranna, is one of the
leading members of the Dailey com
pany that will visit Jackson and Sutter
Creek next week. This is what "Town
Talk," published in San Francisco, has
to say about her: "About a year ago
Miss Cranna was engaged to accom
pany the Janet Waldorf company
through the Orient as far as Hong
kong. She made her debut with, that
company at the late Comedy Theater
as Mario in 'Twelfth Night, ' and • re
coivod many flattering compliments for
her oroditable performance. From that
moment she became a favorite with the
company as well as -with the public.
After her return from' the Orient she
was engaged by Mv> Dailey of the
Dailey company, which is traveling
along this coast with success. She has
proved her cleverness in soubrette
parts during the last five months. The
critics in the interior towns are lavish
in their praise of Miss Cranna'a work.
One of the most prominent sketch ar
tists appearing at the. Orpheum offered
her a position in ' his company. The
young lady's opntract with Mr. Dailey
prevented her accepting this engage
mont. Miss Cranna is a pretty young
woman, with lots of energy and am
bition, and she will no doubt, ere long
make her mark."
The fine spring weather has awaken
ed tho baseball fever in the boys, and
there is a great concourse of the lovers
of this great sport every Sunday in
our town.

merchant (Sing Kee) for a . period of

CATCHING AND KILLING THE MON-
V BTER TUNNY FISH.
They Are First Driven Into Enor-
: |"' muni Nets In . the Mediterranean
Sea and Are Them Stabbed and
Slashed to Death With Spears.
'One of the most thrilling and won
derful sights In the world is that of the
tunny fisheries of the Mediterranean
sea. .The pursuit of these great and
. swift fishes is not a mere tame operation
of netting, "it Is a fight between man
I and sea creatures such as Is duplicated
nowhere except In the whale fisheries.
The tunny Is a huge mackerel. He is a
predaceous fish, and his course through
the seas is that of a destroyer without
parallel. So deadly Is the tunny to the
schools , of herring and similar j food
fishes that he is called the herring bog.
In our waters he Is known more gen
erally as the horse mackerel.
The tunny fisheries are distinctly Eu
ropean, and- they are the oldest Indus
try that is known In the Mediterranean
sea.' To capture them men must band
themselves together In large bodies,
' for fishermen singly could do nothing
.with these fishes, which growtoalength
of ten feet and weigh over half a ton
sometimes. Therefore there Is a' sys
tem of co-operation on the coasts that
are visited by the tunny, a system
which dates back to the Phoenicians,
- who were great tunny catchers In their
": timeJ ;'. ; : ''.>'<
The perfection of this system Is due,
among other things, to the fact 'that
the big fishes have absolutely regular
habits. In normal times they can be
relied on to make their appearance at
certain periods almost to the minute.
When they come,' lt is In huge schools
that can be seen afar, for they scour
the waters like ships of war, and the
leaplngs of their prey and the leapings
of their own bulky bodies beat' the
deep Into white foam and lather,
j Since they are so exact in their bab
j Its, the fishermen prepare for them al
ways before they arrive. At some des
ignated spot are spread enormous nets,
exceedingly deep and made of ' the
strongest of line. These are not de
signed to catch the tunnies. They are
spread out merely to force the fishes to
edge in and in until they are led to the
real prison net, which is a vast con
trivance set in an Immense square and
powerful enough to defy anything that
swims.
As soon as the last of the school has
entered this boxllke lnclosure the sides
of the great net are raised at a signal.
At first the Imprisoned fishes do not
- show any signs of alarm, but as the
net rises, Inch by inch, from the water
depths gleaming, swordlike backs ap
pear here and there above the surface,
darting with Incredible swiftness from
side to side of the net Each Instant
more of these living blades appear
above the surface.
Then the fishes begin to leap. Here
one launches himself straight out of the
water— soo pounds of glorious life^to
ward the sky, to crash back Into the
sea with a-flaillike blow of sides and
tail that makes the ocean echo.- - An
other and another rises and falls back.
Boon the scene Is as If the abysses of
the sea were spouting their inhabit
ants, for hundreds of Immense silver
flashing fishes rise everywhere at once
; : within the net , ;
But now a new element | enters.
Long/narrow fishing boats push Into
the lnclosure. In them stand brown
men with lances and spears and big
I knives lashed to poles. Then begins a
fight that Is terrible to see. The men
thrust madly into the struggling mass
es of fishes. The fishes leap and roll and
dive and leap again, hammering the
sea with tails that churn like the
■ screws of steamships and whiten the
waves with foam. Before many mtn-
I ntes boats and men are drenched with
: bloody water. The - surface of the
ocean is red. Out of the smoking
spray peer faces now and then that are
dabbled with blood till they look
scarcely human. ... -.
■ Now and then a man slips and falls
among the harried fishes. Then there
are loud screams from his companions
and cries of supplication from him as
he calls to his patron saint, for lt Is no
Joke to fall among those mighty bodies
that ure dashing around In their death
throes. -
So the fight continues till in that in
closed space of sea there Is not a fish
alive. Every boat is half full of water
and . loaded down with living silver.
where the slim, piratical bodies of the
beautiful fishes lie. The inhabitants of
the towns near the scene of this fishing
make a fete day of the arrival of the
tunny, for It means food and employ
ment for many hundreds of men, wom
en and children. The fish Is a favorite
article of food, especially when salted,
and the roe is a great delicacy, which
brings fancy prices. The tunnies that
are caught off the Italian coasts have
to be passed through the custom house
when they are landed, like any other
merchandise, and the streets there pre
sent a strange appearance then, for on
all sidaa are wheelbarrows full of the
shapely, monstrous creatures.— New

The truck driver Is proverbially pro- ;
fane, and when one Is discovered who j
doesn't swear between syllables when
his vehicle la jammed In a bunch of
other trucks and blocked trolley cars
you feel like taking off your hat to him.
Down at Second and Chestnut streets
one afternoon, when traffic was at its !
thickest and tracks and cars were lined j
llong both thoroughfares, two truck- j
men had equal chances of making the i
crossing. One was coming down Chest- j
nut and the other along Second street.
Had. they been ordinary truckmen
each would have whipped up, and the
chances are that a collision would have
resulted. But these two were not or
dinary truckmen. With Chesterfleldlan
grace one waved his arm to the other,
Inviting him to take precedence. "You
first!" shouted the driver, whereupon a
messenger boy who had witnessed the
remarkable scene gasped and nearly
swallowed his cigarette stump. "After
you," was the next contribution to this
remarkable dialogue. "Wouldn't that
Jar you?" muttered a motorman, who
was standing clanging his bell for all
he was worth.
The two truckmen continued to mo
tion for each other to go ahead. "I
insist!" shouted one. "Oh, no; I in
sist!" shouted the other. Finally a po
liceman Interfered. "Say, one o' yous
ducks git a move on," he commanded.

was gradually resumed. — Philadelphia

A Persistent Poet.
Although R. K. Munklttrick has an
enviable reputation as a humorist yet
he is not the quickest man in the
world to see a joke when it is played
on himself. Mr. Gibson, one of the
editors of Puck and also a practical
joker, arranged for a' special jest to
be administered to Mr. Munklttrick.
He had provided a trick telephone
which emitted a shower of flour when
anybody spoke Into It
When Mr. Munkittrick had arrived,
it was suddenly discovered that the
paper had gone to press and that his
copy was too late. There was only
one chance, Mr. Gibson said, and that
was to telephone to the printer and
tell him to stop the presses until his
matter should be set up and Inserted.
He asked Mr. Munkittrick to go to the
phone at once.
Then the staff sat and held their
sides, waiting for the explosion. Final
ly Mr. Gibson rushed to the telephone
and found his friend deluged in flour,
but stiU persistently calling "Hello!"
through the phone.
He led him back and carefully ex
plained the joke.
When he finished, Munklttrick calm
ly remarked:
."Still, I think we ought to let the
printer 7 know about the copy; don't
you?" — Saturday Evening Post.
The Parisian Way.
It must be hard for the untraveled
Anglo-Saxon to grasp the idea that a
poet can without loss of prestige recite
his lines in a public cafe before a mix
ed audience. If such doubting souls
could, however,- be present at one of
these noctes ambrosianse, they would
quickly realize that the Latin temper
"ament can throw a grace and childish
abandon around an act that . would
cause an Englishman or an American
to appear supremely ridiculous. One's
taste or sense of fitness Is never shock
ed. It seems the most natural thing In
the world to be sitting there with your
glass of beer before you while some
rising poet whose name ten years later
may figure among the "Immortal For
ty" recites to you his loves and his
ambition or brings tears into your eyes
with a description of some humble
hero or martyr.— Eliot Gregory In Scrib
ner's.
She Heard It.
The surplleed choir had done Its duty
for the evening service. But all during
the church hours there had been a pe
culiar sound outside as if a child were
crying. In reality it was something
the matter with the organ. It could be
heard distinctly In the auditorium of
the church. When the choir sang the
recessional and marched slowly out of
the church into the dressing rooms,
one of the young ladies among the so
pranos asked the woman who takes
care of the robes:
"Did you hear that awful squeaking
out here?"
"Yes, Indeed, mum; I could almost
understand the words."
And nothing more was said on the
subject— Detroit Free Press.
More Than He Bargained For.
One evening when a traveling circus
was on Its way to a largo town the
proprietor resolved to make a halt for
a few hours at a village some two or
three miles from the town. ■ So an
agent was sent on In advance to the
village to secure a favorable field for
the rest by the wayside.
Noticing a large and suitable field,
he sought out the owner and told him
he would like to turn something out in
the field for an hour or so before going
tin to the town and concluded by ask
ing bow much he required for the use
of the field.
"Well," said the farmer, "I suppose
half a crown won't hurt you."
"That," was the ready reply, "will
do very well. But perhaps you don't
mind taking a crown," an offer the
Eomewhat astonished yeoman was only
too glad to accept'
Fancy his surprise when, a few hours
afterward, a herd of elephants, a doz
en dromedaries and about 200 horses
and ponies had not only been turned
out Into the field, but were fairly wip
ing the herbage out of existence.
That the farmer was furious goes
without saying, but the circus proprie
tor pointed out that he had received
twice as much as he had asked for
something to be turned out for an hour
or two.
"But" roared the farmer, more irate
than ever, "do you think I bargn aed
for a Noah's ark?"— Tit-Bits. '

Soldiers Avoid the flcan.
"I hare noticed," said the old soldier,
"that there Is one vegetable 'which the
veterans of the civil war religiously
avoid. That is the bean. It proved a
very staying article, but after we had
campaigned on it from Shiloh to Nash
ville and from Antlctam to the Wilder
ness we were ready to cry 'Enough!'
I understand it is used but sparingly
in the kitchens of soldiers' homes. It
will take another generation to rehabil
itate this vegetable in the affection of
the American people."— New York Hall

LIMITS OF SEED VITALITY.
Ifo Troth In Stories of Germination
After Thousands of Years.
"The statement Is frequently, made
In the popular press," said Professor
L. H. Pammel, government botanist,
"that seeds have retained their vitality
for a long time. Thus It Is stated that
wheat under some conditions has pre
served Its vitality for 50. or 100 years.
It has frequently been stated that
wheat taken from Egyptian monu
ments germinated, but In not a single
i-ase is this germination authenticated.
Not a single grain taken from an an
cient Egyptian sarcophagus and sown
by various persons has ever been
known to germinate, and the condi
tions for preserving the seed In these
Egyptian monuments are better than
In the soiL They are protected from the
Mr and variations of temperature. The
experiment which has been most talk
ed of Is that of the Count of Steraberg
at Prague. He had received the grains
from a trustworthy traveler, who told
him that they were taken from a
sarcophagus. It Is said that two of
these seeds germinated, but It is a well
known fact that Impostures are per
petrated by the people who dispose of
these seeds. In some cases they have
even stripped corn or maize Into these
sarcophagi.
"Many experiments have been made,
not only In this country, but In Europe,
to determine . the vitality of. various
grain seeds.. Thus, barley retains Its
vitality . better than any other cereal,
and this is said to retain Its vitality
from eight to ten years. In the case
of wheat 90 to 100 per cent germinates
in.fronV-one to four years; In five to
seven years, 85 to 87 per cent. In the
case of rye the percentage of germina
tion In five years dropped to 55 per
cent; In seven years?3o per cent; nine
years, 13 per cent. In the case of corn,
I made some experiments a few years
ago to determine the vitality and found
that corn which was kept In tightly
closed vessels at the age of 20 years
tiad lost all its power of germination.
Experiments also Indicate that corn
Uept even a few years became largely
deteriorated and lost much of its pow
er of germination. Even grass seeds
which have been buried at some depth
in the soil and In vessels tightly sealed
failed to germinate after a dozen or
15 years."— Chicago Chronicle.
BOOKS' NARROW ESCAPES.
Vlrsrll's "/Eneld," Works of Aristotle
and Talmud Saved by Good Lncb,
Three of the greatest books in the
world have narrowly escaped destruc
tion, the "^Eneld" of Virgil, the works
of Aristotle and the great body of Jew
ish tradition represented by the Tal
mud.
It is recorded that Virgil on his
deathbed sought to burn the only copy
of the ".iEneld," as he had not revised
it, and when he was foiled in this he
ordered his executors, Varro and Tuc
ca, not to give it to the world, a direc
tion which was disregarded by order
of the Emperor Augustus. -.
, The works of Aristotle suffered from
neglect. Thej* lay many years buried
In a cellar, and when, by mere acci
dent they were at last unearthed, they
were so damaged by damp and dirt
that In many passng'es they are hope
lessly corrupt.^ How great would have
been the .loss of this work to the hu
man race may be judged from the fact
that everything that was known in the
middle agss of the arts and sciences
was derived directly -from these writ
ings.
The Talmud nearly became extinct
through persecution. The posses
sion of the Talmud, by a long series
of edicts extending over many cen
turies, was made penal, and the book
Itself was burned. No fewer than 24
wagon loads of Talmud hianuscript
were burned In France in 1244.— Stray
Stories.
The Model's Hard Trial.
Miss Siddal bad a trying experience.
In order that the artist might get the
proper set of the garments in water
and the right atmosphere and aqueous
effects, she had to lie In a large bath
filled with water, which was kept at
an even temperature by lamps placed
beneath. One day, just as the picture
was nearly finished, the lamps went
out unnoticed by the artist who was
so Intensely absorbed In his work that
he thought of nothing else, and the
poor lady was kept floating in the cold
water till she was nearly benumbed.
She herself, never complained of this,
but the result was that she contracted
a severe cold, and her father, an auc
tioneer, at Oxford, wrote to Mlllals,
threatening him with an action of £50
damages for his carelessness. Millals
paid the doctor's bill, and Miss Sid
dal, quickly recovering, was none the
worse for her cold bath. — Life of Sir
John Mlllals. ' )
Tommy's Speech.
Sue (who has just been asked to play
something on the piano)— l really can't
play anything.
Tommy — But I say, Sue, why don't
you play that piece you spoke to me
about?
Sue— What piece?
Tommy— Why, that one you told me
to ask you to play when we had com
pany 'cause you knew it better'n any
of the others. I forget the name!
Then Tommy was sent to bed.—Kan

Asthma's Clutch
The sufferer from Asthma is constantly
wheezing, gasping, hacking and clearing
the throat. When a storm approaches,
when there is a cloud of dust, when
v a room is being swept,

\; 4Rte^ ! * odor, breathing be-

safe thing to do, and that is take Acker's
English Remedy for Throat and Lung Trou-

13 shown by the following letter from Mr. N.
H. Andrews, a prominent resident of Spring-
field, Ohio, who writes ;—
" IT. H. Hooker & Co., Few York:
"Gentlemen. — It affords me a great pleasure
to assure yon that I have received both im-
mediate and permanent relief from throat,
bronchial and asthmatic troubles by using
Acker's English Remedy, taken strictly ac-
cording to directions- It is a blessing to

"The Worstest Crime Ever."
A young negresa in mourning asked
the magistrate ' for j a warrant In . the
Jefferson Market court -.
"There is a negro who has committed
the worstest crime ever," she said. "It'a
so awful I can't hardly tell about It
My mother died, a week ago, : and be
done took a pawn ticket from the
corpse. '" Now he's done took out a dia
mond ring on that ticket that was my
mother's, and now the ring should be
Wine, but he won't give It to me."
| j VWeU. .that's rather bad," ad-ltted
the" magistrate, signing a warrant for
i he offender.
The young woman returned In the
afternoon In company with a well
dressed negro with whom she seemed
to tie on very friendly terms. He was
thp defendant ■.- .-;
"What have you got. to say to -the
charge?" the magistrate demanded of
him. '£-'
"Why." the man replied smilingly,
"the dead woman was my wife."
"Is be your stepfather?" asked the
magistrate, turning to the girl.
"Course he' Is," she answered.
"And wby didn't yon tell me that be
fore?" - ••
"'Cause I waited that .ring, your
honor." . ■
"Step out" said the magistrate.
"Step out" echoed a. half dozen po
licemen, while the man and the girl
walked out together without a sign of
animosity.— New York Exchange.
A Very Foxy Fox.
A gentleman whose word cannot be
doubted and who is not easily deceived
tells the following:
Very early one morning he saw a fox
eying most wistfully a number of wild
ducks feeding In the rushy end of a
highland lake. After awhile the fox,
going to windward of the ducks, put
afloat in the lake several bunches of
dead rushes or grass, which • floated
down among the ducks without caus
ing the least alarm.
After watching the effect of bis pre
liminary fleet for a short time the fox,
taking a good sized mouthful of grass
In his jaws, launched himself Into the
water as quietly as possible, having
nothing but the tips of bis ears and
nose above water.
In this way he drifted down among
the ducks and caught a fine mallard.'
Though this story seems extraordi
nary, it must be remembered that the
fox manages to capture wild ducks,
wood pigeons, hares and numberless
other animals, sufficient to keep him
self and family, and It Is plain to be
seen that In doing so he must practice
many a trick that would seem Improb
able If related and quite beyond the in
stinct of animals.— Omaha World-Her
ald.
A Queer Transaction.
"A casual observer might suppose
that our business was intensely pro
saic," said a Poydras street commis
sion merchant, "but such is far from
being the case. All sorts of queer
things happen in it not the least of
which are occasional consignments we
receive from nowhere in particular. ...
"For instance, back in 1896 or there
about we got a load of fine onions one
day by boat. No directions accompa
nied them, but we took lt for granted
they would arrive by mall. When the
expected letter failed to put in an ap
pearance and we instituted Inquiries,
we could get no clew, to the identity of
the shipper, and all we could do was to
sell the lot and deposit the money In
bank, waiting on a claimant.
"Fully three years had elapsed when,
to my surprise, another load of the
same kind of onions came to hand, ac
companied by a letter from the sender
saying that he had forwarded a similar
consignment at such and such a date
and that his 'business relations with
the house had been so satisfactory' he
wished to repeat the transaction. We
sent a check for the lump sum, but
what the dickens he meant by his busi
ness relations being satisfactory when
he had had only one deal with u% and
didn't get his money on that I never
found out I suppose he Just forgot"—
New Orleans Times-Democrat
Makeshift Wedding Rings.
Curious Instances have been cited
where makeshift substitutes, for the
conventional wedding ring have been,
utilized during the marriage ceremony.
One such instance occurred some time
ago in a nearby town, where the ring
was missing. Nothing better being
available as a substitute, a curtain
ring was used, and on still another oc
casion the ring handle of the church
key was utilized. A couple in this state
used in such an emergency a ring
formed from the outer edji** of a coin
and which had been carried by some
one present as a curiosity.
A gallant best man came to the res
cue at a recent wedding, when the ring
was not forthcoming at the right time.
He drew from bis tie the slender stick
pin that had been adorning It and,
bending the wire into ring shape, hand
ed the improvised wedding ring to the
distracted groom.
A horseshoe nail bent to the shape of
a ring Is said to bring a great deal of
luck to the owner, and the lead cramp
ling worn six centuries ago has given
place to various rings now worn to
prevent and cure rheumatism. — Cincin
