NOTABLE MAN HUNTS
HOW CRIMINALS HAVE BEEN CHASE
TO THE ENS OF EARTH
Benson, Who Posed, as Hue Patti's
Agent, Cheated Justice by eath
Relentless Energry of the Police In
Tracking; Counterfeiters
There hae been many long pursuits
of criminals, great in the distance tra
eled, the obstacles oercome and the
persistence of the pursuing officers, but
that of Sergeant Wood of the Natal
(South Africa) police Is doubtless a
record breaker The man sought by
Sergeant Wood was charged with em
bezzling  large sums of money at Pie
termaritzburg He got away from
South Africa and went to New York
'Although the detectie had informa
tion as to where his quarry was hid
ing, yet he had first to isit London to
obtain the necessary extradition pa-,
pers Then he hurried to America and
with the assistance of the United States
police ran down his man By the time
he bad reached Maritzburg he had been
traeling hard for nearly three months
and had coered nearly 21,000 miles
One of the sternest chases of recent
years was after Loys arrell, formerly
sergeant In the Seenth United States
caalry arrell enlisted at the begin
ning of the Spanish- American war and
distinguished himself at Cuba There
he fell in loe with a pretty Spanish
girl and beggared himself In buying
finery for his sweetheart To obtain
more money he robbed and murdered
a companion in arms named Crouch
He then fled
A detectie named upuy was put
upon the murderer's track and, finding
a clew, started for New Orleans He
was right in his surmise that arrell
had gone there^but when he arried
the bird had flown, klle had left on a
British mule transport for South Afri
ca upuy took train for New York,
fast boat for Southampton, rushed by
rail across Europe, caught a boat of
the German East African line and
finally arried at Belra, In Portuguese
East Africa
There he waited like a spider for a
fly, and just as arrell was fancying
himself safe from pursuit be pounced
upon him Later on the detectie de
posited his prisoner safely In Castle
William Jail in New York He had
traeled in all 31,000 miles and spent
$1,250 In the chase
One of the most astonishing crim
inals England eer produced was a
man named Benson, who began oper
ations in London with two confeder
ates He organized a series of swin
dling companies In the city, while he
himself, pretending to be an Inalid,
lied in the greatest luxury In the Isle
of Wight He posed as a great phi
lanthropist, was foremost in charitable
works and went Into the ery best
society By dint of bribing certain
officers of the law he lied for some
years on the proceeds of his swindles
But one day the crash came He was
arrested, sentenced and got a long term
In Portsmouth jail
No sooner was be out than he was at
lils old tricks again These culminated
In Switzerland, where he managed to
gain the affections of the daughter of
an English officer Through her he in
duced her father to trust him with the
Inestment of his entire capital, some
$35,000 He bolted with the money
Chased across Europe, a detectie
caught him at Bremen To aoid scan
dal the ictim promised not to prose
cute If Benson would gie up the
money The latter did so and left for
America Hardly was the essel out
of sight before It was discoered, that
the bundle of scrip \ the thief had
banded oer was worth at most $IGO
Followed across the Atlantic, Ben
son escaped to Mexico, where he made
£5,000 by passing himself off as Mine
Patti's agent and selling forged con
cert tickets By this time his photo
graph was in almost eer police bu
reau In the world Yet he dodged and
twisted under a dozen aliases and was
heard of in almost eery South Amer
ican state before a cleer New York
detectie ran him down in Rio after a
two years' hunt
Een then be cheated justice Land
ed In prison in Npw York, he walked
upstairs, chatting amiably to his jailer
Suddenly he made a spring and jumped
clean oer the banister He was picked
up with a broken back and died that
night
The police neer exhibit more relent
less energy than in hunting down a
coiner A coiner's crime is against
goernment, and so the whole forces
of the state are against him The
United States suffers far more from
coiners than England does and is
proportionately keen to run down such
offenders Early in 1000 a man named
Hastings was surprised in his work
shop, from which he had issued many
thousands of small siler coins, but be
was too quick for his would be cap
tors and escaped No fewer than seen
secret serice men were put on bis
track The remarkable fact Is that
Hastings neer attempted to leae the
states
Ellfer, one of the detecties, got a
bint that a stranger was In the woods
He took a blanket and some food and
bid himself In a thicket Very early
In the morning Hastings passed, carry
ing a bag of food Ellfer tracked him
to'his refuge and saw that the forger
was armed He waited some distance
away In hiding When night came,
Hastings came out with a dark lan
tern and searched eery bush near his
hiding place At last he was satisfied
and went back So soon as Ellfer felt
sure the man was asleep be crept up
and had the handcuffs on him before
be could awake On the way^to the
jail Hastings told his captor that he
bad seen him on ' ten different occa
sions an<! had once, in Cincinnati, been
within thret! feet Of him In a theater—

ONE COWSKIN
In Instance of German Military
Thrift anU Red Tapelsm
An instance of military thrift and of
a red tape system which is not peculiar
to Germany comes from the Prussian
war office In 1566 the guards were
breakfasting hurriedly They had on
tho preious day fought the battle of
Soor and had accomplished altogether
a' nine days' march This was not the
era of canned meats, and to each regi
ment had been allotted a certain num
ber of cattle which had been killed,
eklnned and cooked, but while the men
were still eating scouts came in with
the news that the Austrians were near
at hand 
The men got into marching order and
In a few minutes were in rapid ad
ance toward the enemy The Grena
dier guards, conspicuous always for
their dispatch, hurried to such purpose
that they failed to secure the skin of
a cow which had been made oer to
them for rations ' 
When the oiliciai who was responsi
ble for the alue of the hide came to
ask for -it, it had to be reported miss
ing Inquiries were set on foot, ei
dence was collected, and a oluminous
correspondence lasting fourteen or fif
teen months failed to account for the
skin
There had been a cow She had been
made oer to the guards She had a
hide The hide was goernment prop
erty, representing a sum fixed by offi
cial tariff The goernment must be
credited with that sum The hide was
uot forthcomiug Who should be re
sponsible for its cash alue?
It was at last decided that the colonel
of the regiment should be held account
able, and a year and a half after the
conclusion of the seen weeks' war
he was requested by the war office to
remit the sum of 3 thalers, the price
of one cowskin lost by the Grenadier
guards When the sum was paid, the
subject was'at last officially dropped
COSTLY ACCIENTS
A Lost Tin Mine and a Lead 9?ine*x
Eottoniless Pit
Immense plans which seemed about
to be completed, but hae been brought
to disastrous failure at the last mo
ment, are frequent enough in the his
tory of industry
London Auswers tells the story of a
tin mine in England which might hae
yielded a fortune but for a storm
With the finding of a new ein of ore
running out toward the sea a new leel
wns drU'en out below the water; then
it was found that the lode bent up
ward too near the sea bottom for min
ing to be safely carried on Undiseour
aged, the owner borrowed money, built
a sea wall to cut off the water, erected
pumps ami again went to work
On the sixth day just as an enor
mous mass of rich ore was being tap
ped a gale came up, a ship was blown
upou the wall, which went to pieces at
oncc, and the sea droe the heay
stones in upon the thin roof of the
'mine In a moment the workings were
hopelessly flooded, and the owner waa
a ruined man
A story equally tragic is told of the
Speedwell lead mine in erbyshire
Belieing that a rich ein of ore exist
ed in a nearby hill, the owner risked
his entire capital to bore a tunnel 3,000
feet long into the heart of the moun
tain Suddenly the miners broke
through a wall of rock into a ast hid
den caern, through which flowed a
stream of water
They began to dump rock into the
stream, and after 10,000 tons a bridge
began to rise out of the darkness, and
then their farther progress was stop
ped Month after month they toiled,
find at last, after 40,000 tons in all
had been cast into the caern, they
gae it up
That narrow rift is known to this
day as the Bottomless Pit
V;mnj of Wrath
The singular habit of signifying an
ger by yawning Is ccnCned to tie
monkey ; tribe and Is most marked in
the baboon family, though tb; Gibral
tar apes also Indulge In it It Is prob
able that the gesture fc originally in
tended to frighten an adersary by a
display of teeth, Just as a Coi daes,
and that the constant wide opening of
the mouth produces an Inoluntary
yawn In fact, If a human being
keeps on opening his mouth In this
way a yawn will result If two
strange baboons are put together in
the same cage, they immediately con
front each other and commence yawn
ing, and If exed or insulted by is
itors they will do the same thing
Fat Crystals
If email quantities of butter, lard
and beef fat be separately boiled aud
slowly cooled for, say, twenty-four
hours, the resulting crystals will show
ery marked differences under the mi
croscope The normal butter crystal Is
large and globular It polarizes bril
liantly and shows a well marked St
Andrew's cross That of lard shows a
stellar form, while that of beef fat has
a foliated appearance In course of
time, as the butter loses its freshness,
tbe globular crystal degenerates and
gradually merges into peculiar rosette
like forms
An Old Verb
To laze is an old "erb In Samuel
Rowlands' "Martin Markall," 1610, we
are told that "loyterers laze in the
strecte, lurke in alehouses and range
In the highwales" The word occurs,
I beliee, in some of Mortimer Collins'
lyrjcsi
But Cupid lazsth 'mongst the faiery lasses,

THE GAME OF GAMES
Golf, Srj-» TUi Writer, Inole* Art,
Science and Inspiration
It is true that there Is a point of
iew from which golf may be regarded
as an extremely simple game— tbe ery
simplest of all the games with a ball
and a club, says William G Brown In
the June Atlantic The player's object
Is simple and single to the point of
simple, mindedness and singularity, one
might say— to put a small ball In a
small , hole with the fewest possible
strokes But so are the objects of the
highest ambitions, the guiding stars 6f
careers the most perplexed and dei
ous It is true, likewise, that all the
countless strokes a golfer makes are
resolable into three kinds of stroke
driing, approaching and putting But
Mr E^'erard, in a lecture unsurpassed
for truth and brilliancy by any In all
the extremely cleer literature of golf,
has declared that to make those three
strokes aright one must hae "art, scl
enei\ aid Inspiration"
- From the moment tbe ball leaes the
tee, whether it be topped, pulled or
sliced or whether, struck in proper
fashion a trifle below the medial line
and urged forward with on exquisite
free lashing out of the wrists It takes
flight as with wings and seeks its true
course as with a mind and purpose of
Its own until It drops into the cup with
a tintinnabulation that no louder clang
or paean eer surpassed in Its sugges
tion of ictory and consummation,
there is no foreseeing what perplexity
or temptation to carelessness or oer
confidence it will present
Not twice off tbe tee ground and the
putting green will the possibilities and
probabilities of the stroke be quite the
same In the He the wind, the dis
tance to be traersed, the obstacles to
be carried, there are ariations not to
be reckoned by any known mathemat
ics
 Then, as the match approaches Its
dreadfully quiet climax of defeat or
ictory, the responsibility may grow
positiely j appalling"" The ery delib
eration which, impossible in most
games, is so characteristic of this, so
far from lessening the strain on one's
neres, undoubtedly heightens it One
has time to estimate the emergency, to
realize the crisis
Not the fiercest rally at tennis, not
the longest flnd timeliest home run at
baseball, not the most heroic rush at
football, requires a more rigid concen
tration of thought and energy or a
more dauntless courage than tbe flick
of a putter that sends the ball crawl
ing on its last little journey across the
putting green when the put Is for the
hole and the hole means the match
There is not a quality of mind or body
—I will not except or qualify at all—
no, not one, that life itself proes ex
cellent which a circuit of the links will
not test
The eclaration
It is a rather curious fact that while
facsimiles of the eclaration of Inde
pendence were common enough se
eral years ago and were largely used
for adertising purposes they are now
ery scarce— so scarce that a Phila
delphia collector recently paid §10 for
one bearing the adertisement of a
western railroad The original docu
ment, presered In glass, is still to be
seen in the possession of the depart
ment of state in Washington, but It has
become so faded as to be nearly illeg

WHERE, OH WHERE?
* A noticeable feature of the demo
cratic conention in Sutter Creek
was a professed scrupulousness in
regard to the letter of the law It
was a gathering where lawyers, and
those in charge o f the legal ma
chinery of the cou''y were in con
trol A fussy spirit, born of a de
sire to steal a march in some way
upon the proceedings of the repub
lican conention held only a week
before, seemed to preail It was a
fine scheme to place democracy in
the know-it-all column, and their re
publican opponents in the know
nothing attitude It was a taking
idea, that promised to reflect credit
upon themseles, and discredit upon
the republicans Casting a legal
and hypercritical eye down the line,
they discoered a mare's nest The
republican conention had nominat
ed candidates by acclamation — that
is by unanimous ii oce ote So
when nominations were in order, the
democratic conention started in to
follow suit When up jumps an ob
jector That plan would not do
The law in such cases made and pro
ided, required the secretary to cast
the ote of the conention Not a
soul had the temerity to dispute this
proposition of law And so it came
to pass that the absurd scene was
enacted in eery nomination made —
from superior judge down to con
stable for the respectie townships
— of the secretary putting in and
taking out a scrap of paper from
a hat, and thereafter by some
legerdemain process branding it as
the ote of 67 indiiduals compris
ing the gathering It was a soul
inspiring spectacle Eery sensible
man in the hall must hae been pro
foundly impressed with the genius
of the legislator who could thus do
the miracle act of transforming one
innocent ballot into any number of
ballots required, and label it u due
process of law" The delegates
waxed gleeful oer the dilemma, and
told the "terrified" how their repub
lican friends had bceu caught in the
meshes of a "web" One speaker,
more bold than the rest, actually
patted the democracy on the back,
metaphorically speaking, for its
stern adherence to the technicalities
of law He eidently was not enthu
siastic oer the "one means 67" per
formance, but neertheless it was
declared to be the law, and that set
tled it The writer was fairly nou
plussed, not so much for the safety
of the republican ticket that had
run into such a fatal snare, but for
the fair name of the California legis
lature Was it possible that the
law making power had resoled it
self into a lunatic asylum, and placed
such an idiotic proision upon the
statute book? What would become
of the aunted freedom of the Amer
ican citizens, if such tomfool ideas
were to be eleated into law We
hunted up the California election
laws, and lo what a load was lifted
from our saddened spirit on disco
ering—as we fully expected to dis
coer — that no such silly proision
was contained in the book It was
a bugaboo of their own creation — a
sample of democratic conention
made law Conentions may, and
often do adopt the rule, but to say
that such mummery is mandatory
under the state -law will not pass
muster We therefore, join with
our readers, in indulging the hope
that the country is still safe, the
proclamations of the democracy to
the contrary notwithstanding
EGENERATE MANAGEMENT
The degenerate trend of the local
democracy under its present man-
agement was signally illustrated by
the action of their conention in re
gard to the justice of the peace in
township one It is well known
that the administration of justice in
this township falls a long way short
of what it ought to be We are
willing to concede that tbe justice
, has "done the best he knew how"
__Still there is no denying the fact,
• that the safeguarding of the rights
of citizens and of the community has
been more in the nature of a broad
farce than anything else To no one
are the shortcomings of the present
regime more apparent than to those
in Jackson who shape the destinies
of the local democracy Indeed,
they hae frequently expressed
themseles in regard to the intoler
able state of inefficiency, and a deter
mination to do their utmost to end
; it Sympathy has played a conspic
uous part in continuing the court as
it is, and this same potent factor in
politics is relied upon to cut a figure
in perpetuating the conditions under
which we hae suffered for so many
years We hae no objection to
sympathy entering into politics If
public interests can be subsered
'  <', "
equally as  well by following the
promptings of sympathy, no alid
objection can be raised against tra
eling the sympathetic path For
many years no one has contested
for the democratic nomination
agains the present incumbent, prob
ably from sympathetic moties
This year, howeer, three other can
didates announced their intention to
go before the conention, each one
possessed of more thau aerage in
telligence It became the most
sought-after oflice in the county,
not because there was mouey in it,
but in response to the demand for a
change The aspirants were encour
aged by party leaders, and promise
of relief spanned the democratic
conention, Now what is the result
One by one, these intelligent citizens
are told that they hae no show of
success — told by the ery men who
encouraged their candidacy in the
first place One after another they
dropped out of the race, until finally
the incumbent is left the lone seeker
for the nomiuation as of yore Thus
are public interests subordinated to
party necessities emocratic can
didates for re-election perhaps
thought they would lose a few otes
if things were changed So the op
portunity which they failed to take
adantage of has been relegated to
the people in general at the ballot
box We beliee the people will
know how to deal with the issue,
and also with the party that has not
the courage to face a local proposi
tion when 'it is squarely passed up
to them
U S Gregory, in acknowled^'ig
the houor of his nomiuation as
sheriff, emphatically and in all seri
ousness declared to the democratic
conention, in reference to his re
publican opponent, that "tbe Lord
God Almighty knows he will need
the assistance of his friends" That
was certainly a wise remark to be
dropped by an astute politician For
whose enlightenment was it intend
ed? Eery one that knows Tom
Norman is fully aware that he is  a
long way from that state of self
sufficiency as to imagine that he can
get along without the assistance of
his friends His friends also are
alie to the fact that he will need
their help, and they will tender it
williugly and liberal!}' By the way,
are the oters of Amador county to
infer from the characteristic remark
of the democratic candidate that
Mr Gregory does not need the as
sistance of his friends Is his own
right hand strong enough to win
the ictory It is just that sort of
spirit that the citizens of Amador
county are getting heartily sick of
When a serant, of the people as
sumes the air of the autocrat, and
imagines he is the whole show in
himself, they hae unquestioned
grounds for thinking that a change
is desirable, and will act according
ly "Pride goeth before a fall"
The democratic conention, which
was to hae been, according to those
not on the inside, a free-for-all, go
as-you-please scrimmage, turned out
to be a mutual admiration society
Eery candidate was patted and
palaered by the conention, and
the candidates cMd the slobbering
act likewise On the surface, eery
anticipated point of friction was
smoothed down Tom Gartlin, who
was on the opposition program for
the sheriff nomination, -was put
hors-de-combat by being elected
chairman A B McLaughlin, who
was also spoken of for the shriealty,
or at least the superisor nomina
tion in his district, was sent to the
state conention Sargent, who
was after the justice of the peace for
township one, got the  chairmanship
of tbe county central committee in
stead In fact, eerything was done
to plaster up the sores, and if any
remains still open, it is for the rea
sou that they did not hae enough
sticking plaster to go round
PAREE FOR GOVERNOR
After fie ineffectual ballots, in all
of which goernor Gage maintained
a strong lead, George C Pardee of
Oakland, the well-known oculist, was
nominated for goernor on the re
publican ticket on  the sixth ballot
The honor fell to the Alameda man
through the strengh of the Gage
forces being thrown solidly in his
faor, the final ote standing Pardee
518 to 213 for Flint The Amador
delegation on the last ballot stood,
as we are inlormed, ais, Marchant,
Herrick and Whitinore for Pardee;
Voorheis, Tregloan and Barney for
Flint The outcome of the long
drawn-out struggle will be hailed

of his party

V - Personal Without a Scratch
The democratic conention for the
nomination of a full got of county of
ficers, met in Sutter Creek on Satur
day, August 23 A liely time was
looked for as the upshot of the igor
ous kicking and pulling that has been
going on in the ranks of the "terrified"
for many months past, and as a result
a number of outsiders were attracted
to the scene in the belief that there was
likely to be some fun But they were
disappointed One of tbe tamest and
least-ruffled gatherings, from surface
indications, that has eer assembled in
Amador county was tho outcome As
one delegate said, "I don't know what
we came for; we had nothing to do, we
were not called upon to settle a single
proposition that was not already set
tled beforehand Half a dozen men
might hae met and transacted the
business just the same" It docs not
follow, howeer, that this cut-and
dried proposition was entirely satis
factory It was the result of a- good
deal of political manipulation and wire
pulling The seeds of discontent are a
long way from being eradicated
The conention assembled in Le
aggi's hall at eleen o'clock, and was
called to order by T M Ryan, chair
man of the county central committee
On motion Thos Gartlin of lone, was
made temporary chairman, and J A
Barber of the agricultural experiment
station, temporary secretary
The ; usual committees wore then
named
The conention thereupon adjourned
until half-past one o'clock

The committee on permanent organ
ization and order of business reported
that the temporary officers be made
permanent, also that C E Jaris be
mailo ice president; the election of 7
delegates to the state conention, one
from each township and two from coun
ty at large, and thereafter the nomi
nation of county officers in the usual
order
The report was adopted as read
The committee on platform and reso
lutions made a brief report, reaffirming
allegiance to the doctrines of democracy
as taught, by Thomas' Jefferson and
Andrew Jackson Commended, the
democratic county officers for the faith
ful and economic discharge of their
duties Pledged earnest support to
the candidates nominated by the state
and district conentions Indorsed the
Amador ispatch as the exponent of
the democratic faith in Amador county
enounced as unjust tho apportion
ment of the assembly district, by which
Amador county has been depried of a
representatie in the legislature In
dorsed E C Farnsworth for a place on
the stato ticket as justice of supremo
court
W Ford wanted to know why the
name of W J Bryan should not be in
cluded in the platform -Mr Bole as
chairman of the committee, had no
objection to the suggestion, and so the
muchly repudiated man from Nebraska
was placed side by side with Jefferson
and Jackson, and tho report as amend
ed was adopted With this mix-up
there was probably not a delegate in
the hall that had any i3ea where he
was at It wa3 a striking illustration
of the statement that the democratic
party is able to straddle or swallow any
old thing that comes along without so
much as blinking an eye The only
lie issue with them is, "We want tho
ollicosPersonal we want them badly; we will
always want them"
ELEGATES TO STATE CONVENTION

r E E Endicott; township 2, John
Muldoon; township 3, A B Me- }
Laughlin; township 4, C E Jaris;
Township 5 A J Cram
NOMINATION OF COUNTY OFFICERS
R C Bole placed R C Ru6t, present
incumbent, in nomination for superior
judge In doing so he tendered the
information that before being elected
to the bench, ho had been in partner
ship with some of the most eminent
lawyers in the state, and in only one
instance had he been reersed by tbe
supreme court There was no second,
and it was proposed to make him the
nominee by acclamation, whereupon J
L Sargent stated that the law in such
cases made and proided rendered it
necessary for the secretary to cast the
ote of the conention for the nominee
This declaration of the farcical and
mock nature of California law pass
ed without challenge According
ly the secretary wrote the name of the
candidate on a slip of paper, threw the
same in a hat held out to receio it by
W L Rose, the sergeant-at-arms, and
immediately rescued the precious slip
from its repository, and announced
that the ote of the conention, with
out stating the number of otes, was
for R C Rust for superior judge This
comedy in the name of law was repeat
ed in eery nomination made for not
only county officers, but also for town
ship officers
A Caminetti, with au eye to busi
ness, intimated that an important point
had been oerlooked, and moed that
eery candidate placed before the con
ention be required to deposit fie dol
lars with the secretary • Carried
Judge Rust then appeared, and put
up the coin, thanked the conention
for the expression of confidence of the
democratic party in his administration
of nearly 8 years All his hopes and
interests had been bound up in Amador
county since 1883 He had discharged
his duties the best he knew how, and
if again honored, would continue to do
so
Sheriff and Tax Collector— J W
Surface nominated U S Gregory, and
said that he was not a one-sided sheriff;
he was the people's sheriff; he had no
superior, and few equals; he had fol
lowed offenders into Arizona; he had
paid eery cent collected into the coun
ty treasury— what more do* you "want
r Endicott seconded the nomina
tion, and said that U S was a democrat
from the soles of his big feet to the
crown of his big head Some of those
who seemed to think that tbe demo
cratic party of Amador is dead and
buried, will find themseles irretrie
ably tangled In the meshes of the web
This little funnyism seemed to tickle
the democratic palate amazingly
U S Gregory stepped to the stage,
and said it was the fourth time that ho
had been nominated for this position
unanimously He could not repay
them for the honor except by honest
and faithful serice He expressed the
opinion that the "Lord God Almighty
knows that his opponent will need the
support of his party and friends" in the
fight for the office
istrict Attorney — C E Jaris nom
inated and R C Bole seconded C P
Vicini for this office, the latter pro
phesying that he would hae a bigger
majority than he had last time The
nominee in response also had to express
his belief that he was going to be re
elected in Noember
County Clerk and Auditor— For this
place C E Fournier placed in nomina
tion the present incumbent, C L Cul
bort, seconded by J L Sargent The
candidate in acknowledgement admit
ted that ho had a harder light than he
eer had before, and called upon those
in the hall to assist him
Treasurer— A Caminetti placed Geo
A Gritton-before the conention for
this office
County Recorder — A Caminetti nom
inated  A Patterson, the present
recorder, who, amid much cheering,
thanked his party for the honor, and
hoped that the entire ticket named
would be elected, and if his ote would
do it, they should hae it
Assessor — J L Sargent nominated
John W Mathis of Willow Springs
C E Jaris seconded, who also fell
into the prophetic line, saying that ho
would bo elected The nominee said
ho had heen 25 years in the party, and
during all that time had taken part in
its deliberations and meetings, but had
neer before allowed his name to be
mentioned in connection with any
official position
School Superintendent— Geo A Gor
don, present incumbent, was named for
renomination by T H Gartlin and
seconded by J L Sargent Mr Gor
don in response said that some might
find fault with him because he had
been such a stickler for law But how
careful the conention had been in the
same direction Instead of the accla
mation business, one man had been
asked to cast the ote of the entire con
ention for eery candidate nominated
Why? For no other reason than that
the law required that a ballot should
be taken by the conention - 
Coroner and Public Administrator-
George M Huborty of Jackson, was
named for this pace by R C Bole and
seconded by S N  Spagnoli
County Sureyor— W L Fortner
placed William Brown of Oleta, before
the gathering, and the 85 deposit was
remitted in this case, and also for town
ship nominees except superisors

by this time had been shorn of half its
numerical strength, as followsPersonal

that the Amador conention declined
to express itself on the question, other
than to refer it to the seen delegates
elected to the state conention, that he
had no show to secure the nomination,
and hence he concluded to keep away
from tho conention Neither he nor

welling House Earned
One of the double dwelling houses
owned by A C Brown on Summit
street, was completely destroyed by
fire Wednesday morning It was a
largo frame building, with basement
and ground floor, and was occupied,
until the day before the (iro by three
families Mrs Crook lied in the south
part of the ground floor; the north
part had been occupied by t he barber
Gasparoni and wife, who acated the
premises on Monday, and left them
seles for San Francisco the morning
of tho fire The lower part was oc
cupied by a family named Gioanoni
A galanized iron flue, that ran from
the basement to the roof, and was
used by the two families, was the cause
of tho fire It was placed close up to
the woodwork, and anything like a
fierce fire in the stou was liable to
ignite tho lumber Three or four times
a fire had been started in this way, tho
last time being only last Monday
Wednesday morning about 11 o'clock
the roof around the stoe pipe was
found to be in flames The fire-bell
was started by hand, and people with
fire apparatus from both fire houses
were promptly on hand Little, how
eer, could bo done toward saing the
building The furniture was nearly all
got out from both apartments Tho
water power aailable was so feeble
that no stream could be thrown on the
top of the house where it was ablaze
This, by some, was supposed to be
caused by a lack of a full head; others
attributed to the fact that all 'oer
town hoses wore trotted out and
brought into use, and also tho long lines
of fire company's hose were leaking bad
ly at almost eery joint, materially re
ducing the supply at the nozzle The
firemen worked uobly under these dis
adantages, and managed to confine
the flames to the one building, - which,
howeer, was entirely destroyed The
loss is estimated at fully 31000, with no
insurance Fortunately, the wind was
from the west, which blew the flames
toward a acant lot on the opposite
side of the street Had the wind been
in any other direction, there would
hae been little hope, with the scant
water supply, of preenting a far more
serious conflagration The shade trees
on either side of the burniug building
were of material help in preenting the
spread of the flames
Mrs Crook lost all her kitchen furni
ture, and considerable other furniture
She was fully insured in the sum of

A Scarcity of Water
There was much unfaorable com
ment at the time of the fire Wednes
day, on account of tho shortness of
water As usual the owner of the
water works fell heir to the major
share of tho blame Questions wore
tired at the manager, why the tanks
wore not kept full, and why tho water
was not shut off from the other portion
of town, as of courso when eery
hydrant is open the pressure aailable
for fire purposes is thereby reduced
Mr Blair, the manager, says that it is
no part of his duty to look after the
tanks Those tanks are the property
of the ditch company, and tho owner
of tho town water works has no more
right to interfere with them than any
other citizen Neither is it the pro
ince of the water works to shut the
water off from any point in town during
'a tire It seems that all such matters
ought to be arranged by the fire com
pany What is a fire company for
unless to take charge of all- such work
in the emergency of a fire A man
ought to be employed whose business,
at the first tap of the bell, should be to
make for the tanks at the head of the
pipe, and see that eery thing was right
Another ought to be selected to shut
off the water from certain points not
menaced, so as to secure all the water
possible at the danger point Aboe
and beyond all, protection agaiust fire
demands that the apparatus for fight
ing fire be keptin order; that couplings
are in working trim and can be readily
jointed ; that tho joints are reasonably
water tight, and nozzles likewise Fire
houses and fire alarms are of little
aail unless the means are aailable to
contend against a fire when one occurs
We hae men who respond at eery
fire, and do their utmost i subduing
the flames They are always at the
iront on such occasions, and the citi
zens owe them a debt of gratitude they
can neyer repay Rut they cannot be
expected to look after things all the
time If a small sum monthly were
paid to some one to look after such
matters as tho water supply, and tho
hose, and couplings— the small things
on which big results depend— it would
bo money well expended

SHOT EA BY A WOMAN
A Midnight Tragedy on
•Broadway
An Intrndcr at Peroich's Boarding
House Instantly Killed by
Mrs - Peroich
At the dead hour of midnight a fatal
shooting took pla<?e at Personal Peroich's
boarding house on Broadway, Jiickson,
the ictim being an Austrian named
Petor Mihaijloich, who was employed
at the Gwin mine He formerly worked
a-s cook at Peroich'*, but left about
15 months ago, and siaco that time has
worked as a miner at the Gwin An
drew Peroich, tho boarding house
keeper, has been sick for some time,
and trying to recuperate at the springs
He left for Byron Springs again only
last Saturday, and was there at the
timo of tho shooting, his wife being left
in charge of the boarding house, where
a largo number of boarders are ktpt,
tho sleeping  rooms being mainly in
rear of tbo residence portion of the
premises About midnight Thursday,
after eery one had retired, Mrs Pero
ieh was disturbod by some one about
the premises Tho footsteps indicated
that the man was prowling around from
no good moties Mrs Peroich was
occupying  room on tho north side of
the building and immediately adjoin
inir the room fronting Broad way The
3
bedroom window stands six feet from
the sidewalk, but immediately below
there is a entilator opening into the
basement about 18 inches from the
ground, and from this one could easily
climb to the window" Mrs Peroieh
was nerous and alarmed at the strange
footfalls, fearing that tbe man was
beut on mischief All the outer doors
were kept locked But Mlhaijloioh
gained an entrance by means of a win
dow in the rear of the kitchen This
was simply protected by a screen, which
was easily remoed" The intruder
thereby gained access to a room ad
joining the kitchen He then passed
through the kitchon, dining room, sit
ting room, to a small hallway, the
partition of which separates the hall
way from Mrs Peroieh's room Upon
this  wall he commenced rapping
There appeared to be no one else awake
at tho time, although Miss Peroieh,
in another room, says she heard noises
Finally tho intruder passed out
through a side entrance, and took a
position untler the window of' Mrs
Peroich's sleeping room, and raising
himself up from tho entilator stop he
began knocking on the window Mrs
Peroieh, although thoroughly fright
ened, but determined to protect taor
self, asked, ''What do you want" He
said, I> l waut to como in your room; 1
want to talk to you for an hour or
two" She recognized the oice, and
told him to go away; that if he did not
she would shoot him The man
actually drew his reoler from his hip
pocket, and presented it to her saying,
"Hero's  reoler, take it and shoot
if you waut to" Mrs Peroieh pushed
him from tho window, saying, "No, 1
hae a reoler " The man was per
sistent, and again attempted to climb
up by tho window, when Mrs Poro
lch, in self-protection, fired Tlie
pistol was but a fo inches from the
man's head, and tho first shot struck
him squarely in the right eye, pene
trating the brain and killing him in
stantly Ho fell backward dead In
the nerousuess of tho moment Mrs
Peroieh says sho may hae discharged
two or throe chambers afterwards, but
they were fired simply at random The
edge of the window sill shows powder
marks, also marks eidently made by
the hand of the ictim in trying to pull
himself up to tho window The enti
lator step also plainly shows tho marks
of his foot The shooting roused the
inmates and neighbors Nightwatch
man Parker appeared on tho scene
The man who thus forfeited his life as
tho result' of his own folly, lay stretched
out with his head not six feet from the
house, a stream of blood issuing from
the wound, and running fully fie or
six feet, down the path toward tho
front gato Tho Austrian boarders
would not touch the body Mrs, Pero
ich, who appeared sef I -possessed
throughout, would not allow the corpse
to be taken into the house So Parker,
Constable Kay, r Gall and H
Schacht, carried the body from the
fatal spot to the undertaking parlors of
Huberty and Gioannonl
A representatie of the Ledger offieo
saw Mrs' Poroich this morning, and
obtained from her most of the facts of
tho tragedy as detailed aboe She
apparently was not excited, but stated
that the mau bad been a source of con
siderable annoyance It is probable
that he learned of the absence of Mr
Peroich He left the Gwin mine on
horsoback, and tho horse was "found
tied up beyond the Zeila mine, and
Constable Kay had it taken home this
morning Andrew Poroich, husband
of tho heroine, was notified by tele
phono, and is expected home to-night
The sentiment of the community is
entirely with the brae woman who
shot in self defense No legal step has
been taken, and probably none will be
taken, other than the impanelment of
a coroner's jury, which will likely be
held to-day, and this will doubtless de
cide the whole matter

Fine Befrigerating Plant
On Saturday last the representatie
of the Ledger had the pleasure of in
specting the new refrigerating or cold,
storage plant just installed by Geo
Waechter, tho enterprising butcher of
Sutter Creek It is the tirst plant of
the kind installed in Amador county,
and is as far in adance of the old
methods of presering meats as a mow
ing machine is oer a scythe The
storage room itself Is about 10x8 in
size, of sufficient capacity to store from
eight to ten beees The room is lined
with compressed cork^ about two
inches thick This is found to be tho
best insulating material for keeping out
heat that is known Just outside the
coW room is the refrigerating machine
from tho Cyclops Iron Works of San
Francisco By means of pipes the cold
air is coneyed into the room, the tem
perature of which is kept between 34
and JO degrees The machinery is
kept running about 12 hours a day;
and during the stoppage of the other
twele hours, tho temperature in the
room will not increase more than four
degreos, owing to the resistance of tLe
cork insulation
The machinery is operated by a six
horse power Economist crude oil gas
engine, of which E H Schmltz of Sut
ter Creek is the agent It works like
a charm, requiring but two-horse
power to run the works, at an esti
mated cost of from 30 to 40 cents per
day of eight hours The c»st of the
entire plant is placed at something like
$2500 It does the work equal to ono
ton of ice eery 24 hours The cost of
ice would bo at least $10 per day With
this plant the expense, including inter
est op inestment, will not much ex
ceed $1 per day The adantage Is not
merely one of expense, but also of
better results in other ways The air
though almost at tho freezing point, Is
dry There is no dampness or moisture,
which Is the great drawback with ice
It is well known, that meat packed in
ico, will lose its flaor, and will rapidly
taint on being taken from its icy
quarters With the improed method,
the meat retains its flaor, and is all
tho better in eery way for being kept
three or four days Mr Waechter has
made a great stride in the meat-pre
sering business, and other butchers in
the county will do well to look into the
matter with tho iew of following in
his footsteps

IN THREE COUNTIES
A Mountain Eesort That Furnishes a
Perplexing Problem
One of the mountain alleys, known
as Kirkwood's meadows, is located on
the intersection of Amador, Alpine and
El orado counties Tho meadows
take their name from a peculiar genius
who is a combination of cattle raiser,
sheep herder, store keeper, * hotel
keeper and naigator of a wayside
blacksmith shop up there in the sum
mer season, and priate citizen down
on the plains the remainder of the
year 1 recall that the bar of his re
sort, which is located exactly on top
of the corner post marking the boun
daries of the three counties named, has
furnished the license collectors one of
the most intricate mathematical prob
lems eer raised in the state as to which
publican was entitled to gather the
same For it so happened that Kirk
wood could stand in El orado county
and respond to a call for one or the
other of his famous brands of potent
beerage known respectiely as "sheep
dip" and "sheep herder's delight" —
more properly, ''sudden death" and
"lie-a-week" — and set up the bottle
of condensed and concentrated tragedy
in Amador county Then the perpen
dicular bounded warehouse oer in Al
pine county, would lift the bottle from
Amador county and pour out his dose
of fatality in Alpine county, and change'
his breath to a olcanic condition, and
lay down tho price for his es
cape in El orado county* which Zack
would pick up and drop in the till oer
in Amador county By the time the
aquero oer in Alpine had crooked
his elbow twice, ho would find himself
imbued with an unsteady and more or
less dazed impression that he was pos
sessor in feu simple of all three coun
ties, and that his limits wero still en
tirely too restricted
If tho Amador license collector called,
he found Zack busy transferring liquids
from El orado into Alpine, while the
Amador end of the bar was "out of
business" If the El orado man call
ed, Amador and Alpine got busy If
the Alpine bird of prey settled down,
Amador and El orado monopolized
mercantile transactions and, after tho
Alpine aquero paid for his commodi
ties, the laws of free and unrestricted
trade between counties preailed; the
purchaser was permitted to select his
own spot to suicide, and all that Zack
paid the license collectors was his dis
tinguished respects — Exchange

Spontaneous  Combußtion
The coal dump at Garbarini's black
smith shop came near causing a fire by
spontaneous combustion a few days
ago It is of the half-made ariety
from the Jackson alley coal mine
They call it wood coal — in contradis
tinction from the hard or stone coal —
although of course all coal is of ege
table origin This local stuff is midway
between coal and wood Many pieces
may bo picked up from the dump ha
ing more of the characteristics of wood
than coal It can be sliered with a
knife, liko a piece of pine wood It
carries a large percentage of sulphur
Some days ago, the heap, which was
about six to eight feet high, was
noticed to be smoking They set to
work to ascertain the cause, and at the
depth of two or three feet from the
surface the coal was found so hot as to
becomo unbearable to the naked hand
A good soaking 'aerted the danger
It was fortunate, howeer, that the
matter was noticed in time, as a few
hours more might hae started a blaze

From Siler Lake
E S Petois made a flying trip to
Blue Lakes last week, starting Wed
nesday and returning Sunday H
went after his son Julius, but found
that he was working for the Standard
Company at the Meadows dam
Nine camping outfits were met on bis
return trip, among them being Frank
L Pitt and wife, who are making a
two months' tour of the mountains
Frank is looking after a sheep range In
tho mountains with the intention of
again taking up his residence in the
foothills of the Sierras, as he finds the
climate of Boulder Creek, in Santa
Cruz county, too damp for him in the
winter season
There were three camps at Kirk
wood's, two at Capels lake, and none
at Siler lake
The Standard Electric Company has
commenced hauling all the material,
machinery, etc, from the Bear rier
camp to Blue lakes and neighboring
camps Two loads had already ' pa>iei
oer the road at the time our informant

The road is getting rough and badly

The late Noah ais, justice of the

of many Judges and lawyers who

Once a lawyer objected to a witness,
but Judge ais refused to sustain
him The lawyer cried, "But, your
honor, I eubmit"— And here lie broke
off
"That's right," said the judge quick
ly; "always submit Crier, adjourn
court!" 
In one case oer which he presided
there were fifty-fie distinct offenses
and four counts on each offense, 220 in
all
"Well," said Judge ais, "there are
more counts than in a German princi

THE SOUN OF A PIANO,
Seeming; efects That May e Often
ae to Cxterlar Causes
"A piano," said a dealer, "will snine-
deelop or seem to deelop a
flaw in someone note, which comes to
hae a rattle or jingle or unpleasant
burr to it, bnt this jarring sound which
seoms to come from the piano may in
reality come from some source quite
outside of it
'"Any gien note when struck pro
duces a certiiin number of ibrations to
the secoud There may be in the room
some object that Is in tone sympathy
with some particular note, and that
will be set in motion by it when that
note is sounded
"The owner of a fine piano sent to us
one day to say that there was some
thing wrong about a certain note of
the instrument, bo that that note had
sn unpleasant sound when struck
When 1 heard the note sounded, I knew
at once that the disagreeable rough
ness or buzz about it was due not to
any defect In the piano, but to some
thing somewhere about in the room,
aud, asking the lady to strike that note
occasionally, I walked around the room
to see if I could locate it
"Passing across the middle of the
room as that note was struck, the
cause of the jarring accompaniment of
it was, discoered to come from the i
bration of one of the glass globes on
the chandelier oerhead
"The owner of the piano was almost
incredulous as to this, the sou ad had
seemed so plainly to come from the
piano itself But when at my request
she stood under the chandelier and I
struck the note she was readily con
inced
"I made that globe immoable and
then struck the note on the piano The
answer was clear and sweet and true
"So, you see, the sound of the piano
may for one' thing depend much upon
its surroundings, and what may seem
to be a defect in a piano may be in re
ality attributable to something quite
apart from the piano itself '
"And thus It might easily be that
some noble instrument that had seem
ed to be declining or to be deeloping
faults owed its apparent change to a
change of enironment or to some spe
cific outside cause and was in reality
as good as eer, as would happily be
discoered wheneer the instrument
was again brought under faorable
conditions"— Chicago Inter Ocean

AIRY NOTES
Cloer Is better than timothy for
cows
Regularity in feeding nnd milking la
important
To get all of the butter the cream
must be uniformly ripened
In milking squeeze tue teats just
hard enough to get the milk
Ct>wß that are good producers of
rich milk must be good consumers
In order to secure rich milk etnrt
with a rich cow and feed her rich
foods
In small quantities cottonseed meul
is a good feed, but in excess it in
jures tho butter
Kicking a cowPersonal that is lying down
ma"y make her' get up more quickly,
but it will not induce her to gie any
more milk
If rock salt is kept in tho yard where
the cows can lick it eery day, there
is no danger that they will get too
much at once
One of the most important condi
tions of churning is the temperature of
the cream No guess should be allowed,

WHAT IS TEMPERAMENT!
Ko Wonder This X Child's rain Is All
In a Muddle
'Cue half dozen blocks about upont
ci'-j'o include the homes of as many
scientists of national reputation These
gentlemen of course know each other
aud meet frequently Not long ago one
of their neighbors began to wonder
whether such intimate intercourse
pniong scientists was a good thing,
his cogitation haing had its rise in the
following incidentPersonal
His little daughter has just reached
the age when she asks 200 questions a
day About a month ago her father
spoke of some author as lacking the
proper "temperament" for writing on
history That word "temperament"
apparently took root in the youngster's
mind What was temperament? She
asked that question twice an hour for
uu entire week
Finally her father gae her a note to
Professor and sent her off to find
out That scientist answered the que
ry as fCfioirsPersonal "Temperament is an in
diidual tendency to the rise of a cer
tain-mental state" Father and daugh
ter wrestled with that a little while and
then applied to a second member of
the scientific group for help No 2
called temperament "an ensemble of
physical and mental traits arising from
fundamental constitutional differences
in indiiduals" This p"ut the little
girl's father completely at sea So No
3 was tried His judgment was that
"temperament is the psychic resultant
of the whole organic life of the indi
idual" Ry this time hope was aban
doned But when No 4 olunteered to
mnke it clear the family spirits-re
ied "Temperament is a general dis
position of the mind," ho wrote, "the
distinctions of which depend on the
dominance of one or the other of the
physiologic-!! systems"

ANTISEPTICS
They o Not estroy, It In Said, bnt
Only Arrest Genii Life
The Edinburgh Scotsman begs leae
to correct the erroneous belief that im
plies that antiseptics can preent de
cay ecay may be arrested without
killing the microbe which would pro
duce it A few drops of a solution of
carbolic acid added to flour paste will
lteep it sweet for a certain time, not
because the- germs in the paste are de
stroyed, but because these germs are
hindered for the time being ' in their
growth ami multiplication and because
the paste is rendered temporarily an
unsuitable soil for the growth of what
eer microbes may fall from the air in
to it
When the effect of the acid has worn
off and disappeared, we see the paste
going to the bad as rapidly as if it had
not been treated antiseptically at all
Molds will grow in it, and it will decay
in the fashion familiar to eerybody
It is in this way cold may act as an
antiseptic when it is used to presere
meat and fish There is no destruction,
but only arrest of germ life If we wish
to kill microbes, therefore, we not only
hae to use a disinfectant, but we must
employ it in proper proportions and sea
that It thoroughly attacks the germs
we wish to destroy It is for this rea
son that all attempts to kill gex - nis
which the air may contain are worse
than useless We cannot "disinfect" the
nir If we could do so, we should re
quire to saturate the air with our germ
icide to such an extent that to breathe
it would kill us
We get an excellent example of this
fallacy of "disinfecting air" when we
reflect that in using burning sulphur to
purify a room after a feer case we
hae to use it in such a way and in
such proportion that it is impossible for
any person to remain in tho room at
all
Hiding nehind ig; Words
A mining expert recently described a
lode as traersing "a metamorphic
matrix of a somewhat argilloareuace
ous composition" This means literally
'a changed mass of a somewhat clayey
saudy composition" This in its turn
may be translated into plain English
as m-u-d Personal
Why choke a puny fact with mur
derous polysyllables? Huxley and ar
win, Lyell aud Faraday could so write
as to be "understauded of the people,"
and there is a suspicion abroad in these
times that the big words so freely used
by small men are a deice to conceal
Ignorance and inexact thought rather
than a proof of superior knowledge—

THE INNS OF CHINA
Their Cheapness Is Abont Their One
Hedeeniliifr Feature
Chinese mas are without register or
clerks On riding through the gateway
your bridle rein is seized by a dirty
boy, who helps you to dismount, shout
ing ioudly meanwhile for the proprie
tor, who presently looms up through
the wilderness of carts and mules Pro
prietor and boy then hold a parley as
to what rooms are eligible, and then a
door is pushed open and the traeler is
shewn to his apartment It is usually
about twele feet square The walls
and floor are of hard mud, and so are
tho beds, which extend entirely across
the side of the room, with only space
enough between them for a small table
and one chair The room is lighted by
one window, in which paper takes the
place of "glass! !C-*^~
The first duty of the proprietor in
inakiug a patron comfortable is to step
up the holes in the paper window pane
He neer tears the paper off entirely
and replaces it with a new one, be
ciuise the sheet- of paper is worth
about one-tenth of a cent, and the inn
keeper is not wasteful Indeed he
pastes little slips of paper oer the
holes until all the light that filters
through it is of a mottled hue j
At one end of the mule shed is the
kitchen of the inn It is here that the
meals for all the patrons are prepared,
to be eaten in the rooms The menu is
not elaborate It consists only of bowls
of rice and tea Should the traeler de
sire a greater ariety of food, he can
buy it himself in the market, und his
own serant can cook it in the kitchen
of the inn To sleep on the bl of a
Chinese inn would be for a firtigner
an impossibility were it not that he is
always so exhausted at the s end of
each day's journey that he finds it dif
ficult to remain awake ten minutes
after alighting from his pony lie lies
down on the mat that coers the hard
heap of mud and surprises himself at
the soundness of his slumber
Tho one redeeming thing about the
inn is its cheapness Just as the tra
eler is about to depart in the morning
the proprietor tells him the amount of
his bill Eerything is charged on the
"European plan" Eery cup of tea,
eery rushlight candle, the paper win
dow pane, are all itemized i the long
list which the proprietor reels off in
singsong, but the total is surprisingly
low The cost of food and lodging for
one night for a traeler and two ser
ants, with stabling and fodder for his
ponies and cart mules, is about 50
cents— New York Mail and Express
onated Too Soon
The rear end of a Fordham car was
congested the other afternoon There
wasn't een "standing room only" A
jocular commuter said, "Beware of
pickpockets!"
Eerybody laughed
A gentlemanly looking fellow saidPersonal
"Xo man need be afraid of pickpock
ets if he does as I did I hae a self
patented scheme I hae a buttonhole
in my est pocket I run my chain
through it and attach the other end in
the usual way They can't draw that
watch through that buttonhole No
pickpockets i mine, and don't you fcr
get it"
The crowd thinned out
At Wendoer aenue the "patentee"

"My watch is gone!"
Somebody had clipped the chain,
drawn it through the other way and
abstracted the watch— New York

two necklaces, each costing $20,000 and
both being so beautiful that he could
not choose between them So he sent

choice He receied a warm letter of

laces were so beautiful that she could
not decide between them and hence
would keep both, which she did

It was a popular theory in days gone
by that the body of a drowned man
would float the ninth day Sir Thomas
Browne alludes to it as belieed in his
time, anil in his "Pseudo-doxia Epi

fanciful notion It was also belieed
that the spirits of those drowned at sea

their bodies— Notes and Queries
